Yet is the internet any more a \nproduct of material geography than previous communication technologies? Our contribution in \nthe present article seeks to address this question by deploying quantitative techniques to examine \nwhether the country-level adoption of past communication networks \u2013 mail, telegrams and \ntelephone \u2013 was shaped by similar socioeconomic factors. Our results reveal striking similarities \nin the domestic attributes \u2013 income, education and trade openness \u2013 influencing rates of uptake \nacross all four technologies during their major periods of diffusion.  \n \nDigital divide, global, internet, quantitative techniques, telecommunications \n3 \nIntroduction \n \nThe emergence of the internet has been greeted with a mix of optimism and pessimism (The \nEconomist 2007). On the one hand, cyber-optimists have celebrated the potential ability of the \ninternet to free people from traditional place-based constraints, and how the technology provides \nnew opportunities for previously marginalized actors to engage in distanciated forms of \ncommunication, political mobilization and economic exchange (Negroponte 1998; Friedman \n2005; Tapscott and Williams 2007). On the other hand, cyber-pessimists have drawn attention to \nthe internet\u2019s divisive nature, pointing towards its tendency to reinforce existing and generate \nnew socio-economic inequalities across space (UNDP 2001; Lucas and Sylla 2003; Stevens and \nO\u2019Hara 2006). \nMany geographers, but not all, have fallen into this latter camp (Torrens 2008). Hence, \nthey have highlighted the existence of inequalities in internet availability, access and usage, \nwidely-dubbed the \u201cdigital divide\u201d (Graham 2008). Moreover, calling into question cyber-\noptimists\u2019 claims about the uniquely emancipatory nature of the technology, they have suggested \nthat these divides are mapped onto existing spatial inequalities (Warf 2001; Zook et al. 2004). \nIndeed, far from eliminating the significance of material geography, it is argued that the \ngrounding of the global internet network in particular territories is crucially dependent on \nenabling place-based characteristics (Malecki 2002; Warf 2007). \nAll of which raises an important question: is the internet any different from previous \ntechnologies? We know from recent statistical research that uptake of the internet has been \ngoverned by a number of identifiable place-based factors. Yet was the uptake of past \ncommunication technologies constrained by similar geographic attributes? Understanding this \nquestion is instructive about the extent to which uptake of the internet is more a product of \n4 \nmaterial geography and therefore likely to accentuate inequalities (Cutter et al. 2002). More \ngenerally, it says a great deal about continuity in the geographic patterns of diffusion, and \nwhether we can make predictions about the future of the internet on the basis of previous \ntechnologies (Perkins and Neumayer 2005).  \nOur contribution in the present article tackles this question. Focusing on the digital divide \nat the global scale, we use large-sample econometric techniques to investigate whether the \ninternet is any different by examining the domestic determinants governing the spatio-temporal \ndiffusion of two public mobilities (i.e. mail and telegrams) and two personal mobilities (i.e. \ntelephones and the internet) across countries (Kellerman 2006). Our results highlight a high \ndegree of continuity, in that many of the same basic country socioeconomic characteristics \u2013 \nincome, education and trade openness \u2013 are found to shape the uptake of all four technologies \nconstituting different mobilities during their major periods of diffusion. \n \nThe global digital divide and its underlying determinants  \nAlthough the digital divide is a complex construct, which can be understood in many different \nways, mainstream accounts have tended to define it in terms of variations in the spatial or social \ndistribution of internet infrastructure, access and\/or usage (Corrocher and Ordanini 2002, Selwyn \n2004; Oyelaran-Oyeyinka and Lal 2005). Such divides have been identified at a number of \ndifferent spatial scales (Warf 2001). Thus, digital divides have been documented at the \nnational\/sub-national scale, e.g. spatially between urban and rural areas (Whitacre and Mills \n2007) and socially between different ethnic\/racial groups (Gibson 2003); macro-regional scale, \ne.g. between countries or cities in the same region (Chin 2005; Oyelaran-Oyeyinka and Lal \n2005), and at the global scale (Drori and Jang 2002; Dutta and Mia 2008). \n5 \n At the latter scale, much of the existing literature has focused on aspects of the \u2018global \ndivide\u2019 (Norris 2001, pg.4) in internet availability, access or usage between developed \neconomies, on the one hand, and developing economies, on the other (UNDP 2001; Drori and \nJang 2002; Dutta and Mia 2008). This reflects concern about the impact of the digital divide on \npoverty, economic growth and other aspects of development in low-income countries, and how \nthe internet may entrench existing socio-spatial inequalities (Lucas and Sylla 2003; James 2007; \nAl-Fahad 2008). Indeed, a common theme of applied, and many academic, discourses \nsurrounding the global digital divide is that narrowing the gap in internet access will help low-\nincome countries to modernize and develop (see Graham 2008). Yet, as shown in figure 1, the \ndigital divide not only exists between developed and developing countries. Within each of these \ngeneric country groupings, cross-national variations in internet uptake can be found, pointing to a \nmore complex geography of digital inequality. \n \n \nFigure 1 around here \n \n \n One way of thinking about these cross-national variations in internet uptake is as a case of \nspatio-temporal diffusion (Wood 1998; Comer and Wilke 2008). Briefly, diffusion can be \nunderstood as a process whereby a new innovation spreads through a social system over time, \nsometimes replacing (or partially substituting) existing innovations (O\u2019Loughlin et al. 1988; \nShiode et al. 2004; Perkins and Neumayer 2005). Two main mechanisms are identified in the \nliterature to explain diffusion: (a) epidemic-type dynamics whereby contact with previous \n6 \nadopters stimulates uptake as potential adopters learn about a new innovation and; (b) economic-\ntype mechanisms whereby potential users adopt a new innovation as it becomes profitable, with \nuptake characteristically spreading as costs lower or returns improve over time in response to \nlearning. For the former, spatio-temporal variations in uptake reflect differences in patterns of \ncontact between adopters and potential adopters; whereas economic accounts emphasize \nvariations in the characteristics of adopters, with some actors better able to afford the costs of an \ninnovation or exploit its economic benefits (Rogers 1995). \nImplicitly or explicitly, both of these explanations have been invoked in recent work \nconcerned with the international diffusion of the internet. Empirically, this work has identified a \nnumber of domestic, contextual factors underpinning cross-national differences in internet \npenetration. The most important of these determinants, and one which resonates closely with \nbroader concerns about the global digital divide discussed above, is wealth. In nearly all studies, \nper capita income emerges as a positive correlate of internet hosts and\/or users, across both \ndeveloped and developing country samples (Bauer et al. 2002; Baliamoune-Lutz 2003; Guill\u00e9n \nand Su\u00e1rez 2005; Crenshaw and Robison 2006). The importance of wealth can readily be \nexplained in terms of economic-type models: connecting to the global internet network requires \nlarge capital investments (e.g. in terms of hubs and lines) and users have to be able to afford \naccess charges and interface hardware. Hence, effective demand for the internet is likely to be \ngreater in wealthier countries, providing an incentive for private sector investments in internet \ninfrastructure and services. At the same time, private and public actors in wealthier countries are \nmore likely to possess the financial capacity to fund these investments, or else raise finance from \ncapital markets (Beilock and Dimitrova 2003; Lucas and Sylla 2003; Warf and Vincent 2007).  \n7 \nWhile income explains a large amount of cross-national inequalities, the literature \nidentifies three further determinants. One of the most widely studied is human capital with a large \nnumber of studies showing that education exerts a positive influence on domestic uptake of the \ninternet (Kiiski and Pohjola 2002; Baliamoune-Lutz 2003; Quibria et al. 2003; Andonova 2006; \nLiu and Gee 2006; Vicente and L\u00f3pez 2007). Most likely, this is explained by the importance of \nlinguistic and computer literacy for internet usage, but also by the fact that an educated workforce \nmakes it easier and cheaper to install, operate and maintain the network infrastructure needed to \nconnect to the global internet network (Lucas and Sylla 2003; Chin 2005; Warf and Vincent \n2007; Comer and Wilke 2008).  \nInstitutional quality, in terms of how well the institutions of state function, make \ndecisions and exercise authority, is another attribute found to affect uptake (Guill\u00e9n and Su\u00e1rez \n2001; Hargittai 1999; Andonova 2006; Chin and Fairlie 2006; Crenshaw and Robison 2006; Liu \nand Gee 2006). Its significance is widely attributed to the influence of a country\u2019s legal, political \nand regulatory environment over commercial investment decisions (Henisz and Zelner 2001). \nInvestors are more likely to make large capital outlays in telecommunications infrastructure \nwhere the institutional environment provides stable, secure and credible conditions for \ninvestment, such that investors are more likely to obtain economic returns from their outlays. \nA third variable is trade (Baliamoune-Lutz 2003). Trade potentially lowers the costs of \nacquiring the technologies required to interface with the internet, as well as increasing the \neconomic incentives to adopt competitiveness-enhancing technologies, of which the internet is a \nprime example. The influence of trade might also plausibly work via contagion as actors in one \ncountry learn about and emulate technological choices made in another country. Finally, a \nnumber of studies have identified a role for domestic telecommunications policy, with \n8 \nprivatization, deregulation and policies fostering greater price competition between service \nproviders \u2013 for example, through mandatory unbundling and access to the local loop \u2013 identified \nas a positive correlate of internet diffusion in samples of wealthier countries (Hargittai 1999; \nBauer et al. 2002; Guill\u00e9n and Su\u00e1rez 2005; Warf 2007).  \n \nIs the internet any different?  \nThe finding that internet adoption has been constrained by fairly durable contextual factors would \nappear to support cyber-pessimists\u2019 arguments about the tendency of the technology to reproduce \nexisting geographic inequalities. The question addressed in the present article, however, is \nwhether the internet is any different. At a conceptual level, there are a number of compelling \nreasons to believe that similar socioeconomic attributes may have influenced the uneven \ngeographic uptake and diffusion of past communication technologies. \nAs with the internet, technologies such as mail, telegraphy and telephony comprise \ncomplementary networks of physical artifacts, supporting infrastructures and users (Hugill 1999). \nMoreover, the grounding of these elements in place-based contexts is likely to have similarly \ndepended on the hardware and software required to make the technology function, as well as the \nability, willingness and motivation of potential adopters to make use of communications services.  \nWe therefore expect income to have played an equally pivotal role in the uptake of older \ncommunication technologies. As with the internet, domestic demand for mail, telegraph and \ntelephone is likely to have risen with per capita income, in that wealthier individuals should have \nbeen better able to afford respective user charges and possibly have greater uses for these media. \nOn the supply-side, income is also likely to have been important, with the ability of private or \npublic actors to respond to this demand by making capital-intensive infrastructural investments \n9 \nlikely to have increased with wealth (Willmore 2002). In much the same way as the internet, \ndemand for past communication services is likely to have been influenced by the ability of actors \nto use them, and therefore by basic levels of education. An educated population may have \nadditionally supported the effective and cost-efficient installation, operation and maintenance of \ncommunication systems, facilitating their expansion. \nInvestments in capital-intensive infrastructures such as the electric telegraph and \ntelephone services are also likely to have been sensitive to the domestic regulatory, legal and \npolitical environment. In much the same way as the internet, the existence of weak, unstable \nand\/or corrupt political institutions would plausibly have hindered the willingness of profit-\nseeking private actors to invest, retarding the expansion of new communications infrastructure. \nAdditionally, institutional instability will have made it less likely that governments would be able \nto commit to, raise finance for, and complete large public-sector communications projects, such \nas the construction of telegraphy networks. \nSimilarly, the commercial value of mail, telegraph and telephones in facilitating \ninternational exchange, together with greater competitive pressures, means that demand for long-\ndistance communications services is likely to have been greater in open economies. The \ngeopolitical significance of trade for maintaining or extending economic and political power is \nalso known to have led governments of major trading economies such as Britain to subsidize the \ndevelopment of public mobilities such as inter-country telegraphy networks (Hugill 1999). \nAdditionally, trade is likely to have been instrumental in spreading awareness about new \ncommunication technologies, with domestic firms learning from their foreign counterparts \n(Standage 1998). As per contagion models, such knowledge may have subsequently spilled-over \ninto the wider population, stimulating uptake by private individuals. \n10 \nOf course, the ultimate arbiter of whether the geographic determinants of the internet and \nearlier communication technologies are similar is empirical study. There is some existing \nevidence which points to continuity. Quibria et al. (2003) and Torero et al. (2006), for example, \nfind a positive relationship between GDP per capita and the number of telephone mainlines. \nHenisz and Zelner (2001) show that institutional quality has a negative influence on the uptake of \ndigital telephone infrastructure. Similarly, Quibria et al. (2003) find that more educated countries \nhave more telephone mainlines, while Perkins and Neumayer (2005) estimate a positive \nrelationship between levels of trade openness and the uptake of digital telephony. More generally, \nArnum and Conti (1998) find a positive, bivariate correlation between the wired ratio (the sum of \nelectricity usage, phone lines and televisions per capita) and the internet ratio (the sum of internet \nhosts, domains and web pages per capita). \nYet these studies hardly constitute a robust empirical test of continuity. They are far from \ncomprehensive, examining only a scattering of communication technologies and determinants, \nand they use different definitions, methodologies and samples. What this suggests is the need for \na more comprehensive and methodologically consistent analysis. We seek to undertake such an \nanalysis using econometric estimation techniques and panel data on mail, telegram, telephone and \ninternet uptake. We test the following four hypotheses: wealth, education, institutional quality \nand trade openness respectively have a positive influence on per capita uptake of the internet, \nmail, telegram and the telephone. \n \nMethodology \nOur scalar unit of analysis in the present study is the state. We readily admit that analyzing \ntechnological diffusion at the country-level potentially masks a great deal of sub-national \n11 \ngeographic variability \u2013 e.g. between urban and rural areas \u2013 in levels of availability, access \nand\/or usage over time (Graham 2002; Standage 1998). Yet we maintain that our \n\u201cmethodologically nationalist\u201d approach nevertheless remains a useful one for understanding the \nfactors which shape telecommunications connectivity over time. \n \nDependent variable \nOur dependent variables for the present study are the respective annual growth rates in a \ncountry\u2019s per capita uptake of mail, electric telegraph, telephones and the internet. The first two \nof these, mail and telegraph, are examples of what Kellerman (2006) labels \u201cpublic mobilities\u201d. \nTelephones and the internet, on the other hand, are \u201cpersonal motilities\u201d. As their name suggests, \npublic mobilities involve the use of communication technologies designed for the public at large, \naccess to which is mediated through operating agents which may lie outside the user\u2019s private \nsphere (Milne 2009). Conversely, personal mobilities involve \u2018self-propelled\u2019 communications \nthrough media, often characterized by greater accessibility and convenience to private users. \nWhereas the mediated nature of public mobilities implies temporally lagged communications \namongst participants, the individual character of personal mobilities allow near instantaneous \ncommunication, reception and transmission between geographically distanciated actors (see \nKellerman 2006).  \nWe use a flow measure of usage for mail and telegrams, for which we have data on the \nnumber of mail items and telegrams sent, both on a per capita basis. We also deploy a usage \nmetric for the internet, albeit one that measures numbers of internet users per capita, rather than \nactual levels of usage (e.g. number of hours online). For telephones, on the other hand, we are \nforced to use a stock measure of infrastructure, in the form of numbers of telephones per capita. \n12 \nWe would have preferred to use exactly the same type of measure across the four technologies, \nbut data limitations mean that this was simply not possible.  \nData for our dependent variables for mail, telegram and telephone are taken from Mitchell \n(2003). In the case of mail and telegraph, the data stretch as far back as 1830 and 1850, \nrespectively, but comprehensive trade data are unavailable before 1870, so our panel starts with \nthis year for these variables. For telephones, our panel starts in 1890. The telegraph panel ends \nbefore 1970.1 For mail and telephones, the panel stops in 1992 due to unavailability of the \nhistorical trade measure variable beyond this point. Lack of data for the dependent and\/or the \nexplanatory variables mean that the sample covers 68, 64 and 101 countries for mail, telegram \nand telephones uptake, respectively. This is short of universal coverage, but all samples cover not \nonly high-income countries, but also a wide range of low-income ones. (Details of countries and \nthe relevant time periods included in each of the estimations can be found in the appendix). Our \ndependent variable for the internet uses data from World Bank (2005). These data begin in 1991, \nbut the sample ends in 2003, owing to lack of data on some of the explanatory variables. \nCountries enter and \u2013 occasionally \u2013 exit (e.g. during times of war) the dataset according \nto the availability of data. Our panel is therefore \u201cunbalanced\u201d, but the panel estimators used in \nthe present study are able to accommodate such data. In cases where territorial changes have \noccurred during the period of study (e.g. Germany), the data refer to the country in the borders \nduring the year in question. All our variables are normalized by either GDP or population, which \nalso vary with territory, such that boundary changes do not represent a major problem for the \nanalysis. \n                                                 \n1\n Since we are only interested in the determinants of uptake growth, we restrict our analysis to the period \nbefore 1970, during which time the number of sent telegrams is expanding in the vast majority of \ncountries. After this date, telegraph usage begins to decline, sometimes quite dramatically.  \n13 \nWe chose to focus on postal mail, the electric telegraph and the telephone because of their \nhistoric role in communication. All three technologies have \u2013 to a greater or lesser extent, and for \nlonger or shorter periods of time \u2013 assumed central importance in allowing actors to \ncommunicate over space. The chronology of the technologies runs as follows. Modern, pre-paid \nand publicly accessible postal services began to operate in the first half of the nineteenth century, \nmany of them as public monopolies (John 1986; Willmore 2002). Postal mail was joined in the \nsecond half of the nineteenth century by the electric telegraph. (Standage 1998). The electric \ntelephone first emerged in late 1870s, although it was not until the second half of the twentieth \ncentury that telephones became more widely used outside the core of high income, industrialized \neconomies (Hugill 1999; Guill\u00e9n and Su\u00e1rez 2005). The internet dates back to the late 1960s and \n1970s in university and military settings, but only began to be adopted by a wider range of \nconsumer, business and governmental actors in the early 1990s (Warf 2001; Shiode et al. 2004). \nStill, despite becoming one of the fastest diffusing technologies ever, the density of hosts, \nconnections and users remains highly uneven (Graham 2002).  \n \n \nIndependent variables \nThe four main explanatory variables included in the study \u2013 GDP per capita, education, \ninstitutional quality and trade openness \u2013 were selected because they have all been identified in \nrecent empirical studies as correlates of national internet availability, access and\/or usage. We do \nnot explore the role of telecommunications regulatory policy or prices \u2013 simply because there are \nno comparable historical data for competition (and other) policies or user prices for mail, \ntelegram and telephone markets. Still, to the extent that no previous studies have analyzed the \n14 \nrole of wealth, education, institutional quality and trade in the uptake of our four different \ncommunication technologies, we believe that our study makes an important contribution to the \nliterature.  \nData for GDP per capita is taken from Maddison (2003). For education, we use data on \nprimary schooling since, strictly speaking, not much more than basic education is necessary for \nthe use of communication technologies. In the case of the internet, we take the primary enrolment \nratio, using data from World Bank (2005). These data only cover the period from the 1960s \nonwards and we therefore use Mitchell\u2019s (2003) data on the number of primary school students \nper capita for mail, telegrams and telephone. \nIn order to capture institutional quality, we use Henisz\u2019s (2000) metric of political \nconstraints, which is the only available measure that reaches far enough back into the past. It \nmeasures the extent to which political actors are constrained in their future policy choices by the \nexistence of other political actors with veto power, and by the distribution of political preferences \nacross and within these branches of the political system. That is, it captures the degree to which \ngovernments are able to credibly commit to maintaining an existing regulatory regime, and \ntherefore the degree of investment risk. Henisz\u2019s data have been used to measure institutional \nquality in previous studies investigating the uneven diffusion of telecommunication technologies \n(Henisz and Zelner 2001; Andonova 2006), but it is an admittedly crude proxy variable for \ninstitutional quality. Our trade measure \u2013 trade openness \u2013 is given by the sum of exports and \nimports divided by GDP. For the internet, we use data from the World Bank (2005). However, \nbecause these data do not stretch far back in time, we construct a measure of trade openness for \nour three historical technologies using data from Barbieri (1998) and Maddison (2003). Table 1 \n15 \nlists the variables, the underlying concept measured, whether the variable represents a proxy for \nthis concept, together with respective data sources. \n   \nDealing with statistical problems \nAn important statistical challenge is how to deal with the fact that uptake of new technological \ninnovations characteristically accelerates over time, as they benefit from increasing returns to \nadoption (Rogers 1995). Such dynamics have been observed empirically in the historic spread of \ncommunication technologies such as the electric telegraph and telephones (Shiode et al. 2004), as \nwell as the internet (Chinn & Fairlie 2006). Within the present study, we control for these \ntemporal dynamics by including year-specific time dummies, which potentially capture global \nchanges in the availability, cost and functionality of any one technology that affect all countries \nequally. \nWe additionally include the natural log of the per capita technology uptake, lagged by one \nyear. This controls for conditional convergence. The rate of diffusion of many technologies is \ninfluenced by the existing levels of penetration, in that countries with higher levels of uptake \ncharacteristically experience slower uptake growth (Henisz and Zelner 2001; Perkins and \nNeumayer 2005). We also include the lagged log of technology uptake to control for \nautocorrelation in the error term (Beck and Katz 1996). The growth rate is equivalent to the \nnatural log of a variable minus its natural log one previous period. Hence regressing the growth \nrate on the log-level lagged by one period is equivalent to regressing the log-level on the lagged \nlog-level. The only difference is that the estimated coefficient of the growth rate equation is that \nof the log-level equation minus one. What is important here is that the inclusion of what is \neffectively a lagged dependent variable (LDV) allows us to indirectly control for autocorrelation. \n16 \nWe employ standard errors that are robust to arbitrary heteroscedasticity to deal with the other \ncommon problem of statistical inference. \nAnother statistical issue is reverse causality which causes problems because the variable \nthat is subject to reverse causality is also correlated with the error term. The one variable that is \nlikely to be most affected by reverse causality is trade openness. Higher levels of trade openness \nmay well be instrumental in accelerating the domestic uptake of new communication \ntechnologies. Yet uptake of new communication technologies may also stimulate higher levels of \ntrade by, for example, enabling the functioning of regional and international production systems \n(Lew and Cater 2006; Clarke and Wallsten 2007). We deal with this problem by using a dynamic \npanel data estimator in which trade openness is treated as an endogenous variable (see below). \n \nEstimation technique \nPanel data \u2013 of the sort used here \u2013 is typically estimated with either a random- or a fixed-effects \nestimator. The advantage of the random-effects estimator is that it is more efficient because \nestimation is based on variation over time within countries, as well as on variation across \ncountries. The country fixed-effects estimator, on the other hand, exclusively uses the within- or \nover-time variation in countries. Fixed-effects estimation is particularly inefficient for \nexplanatory variables that change little over time. The disadvantage of a random-effects estimator \nis that it produces inconsistent estimates if the country-specific fixed-effects are systematically \ncorrelated with one of the explanatory variables.  \nIn the next section, we first report random-effects estimation results. Formally, this is \nmodeled as follows: \n17 \n1 0 1 1 2 3 4 5(ln ln ) ln ln %it it it it it it ity y y GDPpc primedu instqual trade\u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b2\u2212 \u2212\u2212 = + + + + + +  \n     ( )t i itu\u03b4 \u03b1+ + +           (1) \nwhere i denotes each country and t each year, y is technology uptake per capita and the \nrandom effects assumption is that the unobserved random effects i\u03b1  have zero mean and are \nuncorrelated with each of the explanatory variables. We additionally report results from a fixed-\neffects estimation, which models the i\u03b1  no longer as a random part of the error process, but as \ncountry-specific fixed effects. Lastly, because (1) fixed-effects estimations are slightly biased in \nthe presence of the LDV (Nickell 1981) and (2) we wish to explicitly declare trade openness as \nan endogenous variable, we also use Arellano and Bond\u2019s (1991) dynamic generalized method of \nmoments (GMM) estimator.2 This estimator removes country fixed-effects by first-differencing \nthe data. The first difference of the LDV and of the endogenous variable are instrumented for by \nthe levels of each variable lagged by at least two periods. Our T, the total time period, is \nrelatively large, which would give a very large number of potential instruments. However, \nbecause using too many instruments can bias the estimation results (Roodman 2007), we restrict \nthe use of lagged instruments to a total maximum of eleven. \n \nResults  \nTable 2 reports random-effects estimation results. Consistent with past empirical research, GDP \nper capita, education, trade openness and institutional quality are found to be positive and \nstatistically significant correlates of domestic growth in internet users. Across all four \ntechnologies, we also find that countries with a higher level of penetration in the previous year \n                                                 \n2\n We say \u201cslight\u201d bias because the Nickell (1981) bias diminishes as T, the time period covered by the \nestimations, increases and (with the exception of our internet estimations) T is large. \n18 \nexperience lower growth rates, a phenomenon well-documented in the innovation diffusion \nliterature (Perkins and Neumayer 2005).3  \n \nTable 2 around here \n \nOf greater interest is the question of whether the determinants of uptake growth for our \nthree historic communication technologies match the internet\u2019s. In the case of wealth, we find \nsuch similarity, with GDP per capita positively and statistically significantly correlated with the \nuptake of telegrams and telephones. This is entirely plausible. Like the internet, previous \ncommunication technologies involved large, up-front capital investments, and their expansion is \nlikely to have depended on the ability of consumers to afford user charges. GDP per capita is \ninsignificant for mail, but becomes statistically significant in the fixed-effects estimation (see \nbelow). \nTurning to education, we find that the number of primary-schooled students is positively \nand statistically significantly correlated with telegrams sent and telephones per capita. This is \nconsistent with idea that uptake depends on peoples\u2019 ability to use communications media and \ntherefore some basic level of schooling. Again, the education variable is statistically insignificant \nfor mail in the random-effects estimation, but becomes significant in the fixed effects estimation \n(see below). \nHowever, our measure of institutional quality appears to have no statistically significant \ninfluence on any of the three historic communication technologies, with coefficients for mail, \ntelegrams and telephones statistically indistinguishable from zero. Although contradicting \n                                                 \n3\n The coefficient sizes should not be compared with each other across the technologies. The samples are \ntoo different, particularly with respect to time, for such a comparison to be useful. \n19 \nconventional wisdom about the importance of institutional quality on large infrastructural \ninvestments, our results might simply reflect the leading role played by the private sector in \nfinancing internet growth (Warf 2001). While mail, telegraph and telephone systems often began \ntheir life in the private sector, a large share of investments in expanding these systems were \nsubsequently made by public actors (John 1996; Willmore 2002). And because private actors are \nlikely to be more sensitive to domestic factors influencing investment returns, differences in \nownership provide a possible explanation for this anomalous result. \nFinally, for trade openness, we find consistency throughout. As with internet users, mail \nitems, telegrams and telephones per capita are all positive and statistically significant correlates \nof a country\u2019s share of trade in GDP. A possible explanation for this finding is that, by exposing \nfirms to greater competition, domestic imports and exports might stimulate demand for \nproductivity-enhancing communication technologies. Higher levels of trade are also likely to \nexpand demand for communication technologies to the extent that it implies the need for \nincreased long-distance transactions between actors in different countries. As per epidemic \nmodels of diffusion, international trade additionally potentially supports cross-country learning, \nwith actors in countries more open to trade more likely to learn about the benefits of new \ncommunication technologies. \nNote that the reported R-squared values are relatively low. This is because we have \nchosen to take the growth rate in uptake as the dependent variable. If we had taken the logged \nuptake level as the dependent variable instead, then the R-squared values would be far higher \n(above .9), while the estimated coefficients and standard errors of all the explanatory variables \nother than the LDV would be exactly identical. The coefficient of the LDV itself would be that of \nthe growth rate estimation plus one, as pointed out above, while the standard error would again \n20 \nbe identical. The relatively low reported R-squared values should therefore not be mistaken as \nevidence of a poor fit of our model: measures of fit tend to be low when the estimating equation \nis in growth rates rather than in levels. \nIn table 3, we trade-off efficiency for potential gains in consistency of estimations by \nestimating a fixed-effects model instead. For the three historical technologies, the results are all \nin line with the random-effects estimation results, except that per capita income and primary \neducation variables now become statistically significant with the expected positive coefficient \nsign for mail.4  \nIn the case of the internet, however, there is a dramatic difference between the random- \nand the country fixed-effects results. With the exceptions of the existing uptake level and per \ncapita income, all of the other explanatory variables are statistically insignificant. How might we \nexplain this discrepancy? Most likely, the answer lies in the fact that these explanatory variables \nchange relatively little during the short span of internet diffusion, such that the fixed-effects \nestimation becomes extremely inefficient. The fixed-effects, together with the existing level of \nuptake, absorb an enormous amount of variation in the data over the thirteen years of data \ncovered in the study. Hence the fixed-effects estimator most likely fails to identify the effect of \nthe socioeconomic determinants.  \n \nTable 3 around here \n \n                                                 \n4\n We have no explanation for why the political constraints variable becomes significantly negative in case \nof mail. Yet institutional quality is a variable that changes very little over time. For such variables, it is not \nuncommon for the estimated coefficient sign to switch in moving from random- to fixed-effects \nestimations. \n21 \nIn table 4, we account for Nickell (1981) bias and the potential endogeneity of trade \nopenness by using the GMM estimator of Arellano and Bond (1991). For this estimator, the \ndependent variable now has to be the (logged) uptake level. As pointed out above, regressing the \nlog-level on the lagged log-level is equivalent to regressing the growth rate on the lagged log-\nlevel, the only difference being that the estimated coefficient of the growth rate equation is that of \nthe log-level equation minus one. The GMM estimation results are very similar to the fixed-\neffects results in terms of sign and statistical significance of the estimated coefficients. In \nparticular, trade openness, the endogenous variable, remains a statistically significant and \npositive determinant of mail, telegram and telephones uptake.5 This suggests that our results are \nrobust to correcting for the Nickell (1981) bias originating from the LDV and accounting for the \npotential endogeneity of trade openness. \n \nTable 4 around here \n \nConclusion \nAmongst the concerns surrounding the internet is that it will give rise to new socio-spatial \ninequalities forged around informational divides between the so-called digital \u201chaves\u201d and \u201chave \nnots\u201d. Underlying these fears is the observation that the global internet network is not available \n\u201canywhere and everywhere\u201d (Graham 1998, p. 168) but, rather, its grounding in place crucially \n                                                 \n5\n Note that the number of observations is slightly smaller in the GMM estimation compared to the \nrandom- and fixed-effects estimations due to the need for instrumenting the lagged dependent and \nendogenous variable with further lags. The GMM estimation results have to be regarded with some \ncaution as the estimator is more suitable for samples with smaller T. Also, the estimator depends on the \nassumption that there is no second-order autocorrelation. Fortunately, test results reported in the table \nsuggest that this hypothesis cannot be rejected. \n22 \ndepends on geographic factors influencing the demand for the internet and the ability of actors to \nsupply this demand (Agnew 2001; Sassen 2002; Warf 2007). Our aim in the present article has \nbeen to place these anxieties within context by examining whether the adoption of previous \ntechnologies \u2013 namely, mail, telegrams, telephone \u2013 at the national level was shaped by similar \nsocioeconomic attributes identified in recent work as enabling or constraining the domestic \nuptake of the internet. That is, we seek to address the question of whether uptake of the internet is \nmore a product of material geography than previous communication technologies, and therefore \nmore prone to reproducing existing geographically-inscribed inequalities.  \nOur statistical results reveal a striking level of continuity in the territorially-grounded \nsocioeconomic attributes shaping the uptake of different communication technologies \nconstitutive of public (i.e. mail and telegraph) and personal mobilities (i.e. telephone and internet) \nover the past one-and-a-half centuries. We thus find income has not only influenced spatial \nvariations in the growth of internet users per capita at the country-level over time, but the same \napplies to mail, telegrams and telephone systems. Historical continuity is also apparent in the \ncase of education and international trade: levels of primary education emerge as a positive \nstatistical correlate of domestic growth rates for mail, telegrams, telephones and internet users. \nSimilarly, we find that trade openness is associated with a faster growth rate of all four \ncommunication technologies examined in the present study. Transnational networks via export \nand import linkages would, in other words, appear to act as a catalyst for the domestic expansion \nof communication services, both old and new. The sole exception is institutional quality. While \nidentified as a statistically significant correlate of internet usage, we find that institutional quality \nhad no statistically significant influence on uptake of mail, telegrams or telephones. \n23 \n Our findings therefore indicate that internet usage would, for the most part, appear to be \nunfolding unevenly across geographic space according to long-standing geographic determinants \nwhich similarly influenced cross-national variations in the uptake of previous communication \ntechnologies. While the internet may be new, in other words, many of the factors governing its \nuptake are not. To this extent, our results contribute to a growing body of work which has sought \nto caution against claims about the supposed novelty of the internet, and the suggestion that it is \nsomehow different (Graham 1998; Malecki 2002; Zook et al. 2004; The Economist 2007).  \n  Turning to debates about the digital divide, our statistical results indicate that the internet \nis not uniquely prone to geographically-produced inequality. That is, usage of the internet does \nnot generally appear to be more a product of the attributes of place than the availability and\/or \nusage of previous communication technologies. We  would qualify this statement by noting that \nthe internet is the only one of the four communication technologies whose uptake has been \naffected by institutional quality. Further, because of data limitations, we cannot test the influence \nof telecommunications regulatory policies and\/or user prices, which are known to influence \nuptake of the internet. Yet the finding that wealth, education and trade have produced inequalities \nacross the three historic communication technologies examined here suggests that the way in \nwhich material geographies affect the internet is not unique. \nAll of this does not mean that public policy-makers should not worry about the digital \ndivide. Approximately four-fifths of the world\u2019s population remains \u201coffline\u201d indicating that, \ndespite ongoing catch-up in the number of users in developing countries, a significant global \ndivide persists (Dutta and Mia 2008). Indeed, if historic communication technologies are \nanything to go by, geographic disparities are likely to continue to narrow in the 21st century but \nnot disappear. Another reason to warn against complacency is that statistics indicating a growing \n24 \nnumber of users in developing countries, and a narrowing gap with developed economies, may \nhide as much as they reveal. For a start, aggregate country-level figures for internet access, \ninfrastructure or usage conceal some of the multiple domestic divides of the internet, manifest in \nvariations between different geographical areas or social groups (Norris 2001; Warf 2001). \nMoreover, as pointed out by Graham (2008), the relationship between internet access\/availability \nand development is far more complex than binary accounts of usage\/non-usage suggest. For \nexample, the ability of domestic actors to exploit the commercial opportunities provided by the \ninternet \u2013 e.g. by penetrating foreign markets \u2013 will be mediated by a complex of additional \nplace-based, extra-territorial and international factors. Indeed, there is a danger of focusing solely \non internet access, and of over-emphasizing internet-based development approaches to the \nexclusion of other crucial development interventions (Chin 2005; Oyelaran-Oyeyinka and Lal \n2005). Still, to the extent that inequalities in internet access and availability may affect human \ndevelopment, tackling the divide remains a matter of public concern. Our finding that the factors \nproducing the divide are not altogether new suggests that policy-makers might draw useful \nlessons from the past in seeking to advance uptake of the internet. \n25 \nReferences \nAgnew, J. 2001.
