They conclude that a high proportion of the ship\u201fs \ncrew were foreigners and that this may have contributed to confusion onboard ship and the \nsinking of the vessel. We have re-evaluated the data of Bell et al. and conclude that only \none of the 18 sailors demonstrably spent his childhood outside the British Isles. \nIntroduction \nThe sinking of the Mary Rose has been the source of much historical debate. The English \nblamed the sinking on a combination of poor seamanship and bad luck. According to \n2 \ncontemporary sources, the ship sank after water gushed in through open gun ports during a \nbadly executed manoeuvre. French accounts suggest that the French navy succeeded in \ndamaging the ship before it went down but since the remains of the Mary Rose that were \nrecovered from the Solent in 1982 showed no obvious signs of cannon damage the French \nclaim has long been dismissed as politically-motivated propaganda (Stirland 2000; see, \nhowever, Fontana, 2008). It has also been suggested that the Mary Rose might have had a \nlarge number of foreign mercenaries and \u201eprest\u201f men on board and that this led to poor \ncommunication which may well have contributed to the fatal manoeuvre and the ship\u201fs \nsinking (Stirland, 2000). \n \nBell et al. (2009) worked from the premise that if there were foreigners on board the Mary \nRose when she sank then this ought to show up in the oxygen and possibly carbon and \nnitrogen isotope composition of the teeth of the men who went down with her. This is \ncertainly to be expected as enamel \u03b418O is well established as a marker of geographical \norigin (e.g., Budd et al., 2004). The \u03b413C and \u03b415N data show no obvious patterning and we \nconcur with the authors that there is no evidence for migration from these values. The \nenamel carbonate d18Ocarb values fall between -5.2 and -3.2 \u2030 VPDB, with one obvious \noutlier at -6.7\u2030 (Figure 1). Bell et al. conclude that at least one third, but possibly two \nthirds of the ship\u201fs crew were foreigners who spent their childhood in more southerly \nclimes. We believe that this interpretation is based on a misunderstanding of oxygen \nisotope systematics and that the true picture is quite different. \n3 \nProblems with the approach of Bell et al. \nThe basic assumption behind the approach of Bell et al. to interpreting their data is that \nenamel carbonate oxygen isotope (\u03b418Ocarb) values expressed relative to the VPDB standard \ncan be read alongside drinking water (\u03b418Odw) or precipitation (\u03b4\n18\nOpptn) values, which are \nexpressed relative to the VSMOW standard. The authors base their assumption on the \nresults of an earlier study (Bell et al., 2006) in which they noticed a \u201ccurious relationship of \nrelative comparability\u201d between \u03b418Ocarb VPDB and \u03b4\n18\nOpptn VSMOW values that enables \nus to read them together (Bell et al., 2006: 50). While they acknowledge that it is not \nrecommended to mix scales when comparing data they maintain that there is some utility in \ndoing so because \u201cwhilst not understood, the PDB standard builds in a correction factor \nenabling PDB enamel values to be compared directly to VSMOW precipitation values\u201d \nBell et al. (2006: 51-52). \n \nThe problem with the 2006 study is that it is based on a very small dataset (nine humans \nand 16 horses). As a result, the range of human \u03b418Ocarb values in Britain is not well \nrepresented by their data. We map, approximately, the locations associated with their \nhumans in Figure 2, along with isopleths of \u03b418Opptn (Darling, 2004). It is clear that the \nrange of -7.1 to -5.3 \u2030 for \u03b418Ocarb VPDB corresponds to \u03b4\n18\nOpptn ranging from ca. -8.0 to -\n7.0 \u2030 VSMOW. There is therefore no direct equivalence of \u03b418Ocarb VPDB and \u03b4\n18\nOpptn \nVSMOW. In addition, the total range of \u03b418Opptn values in the British Isles is much larger, \nranging from below about -5.0 \u2030 in the extreme west to below -8.5 \u2030 in the east (Darling, \n2004). Consequently, we believe it is dangerous either to extrapolate even a broad \nequivalence of \u03b418Ocarb and \u03b4\n18\nOpptn in humans, or to consider the data of Bell et al. (2006) \nrepresentative of the British Isles. \n4 \n \nFurther, Bell et al.\u201fs approach contradicts our current theoretical and empirical \nunderstanding of oxygen isotope systematics in the body. Numerous studies have shown \nthat the relationship between the isotopic composition of the body\u201fs oxygen pool and that \nof drinking water is not direct but linear and species-specific (e.g., Kohn 1996; Longinelli, \n1984; Luz et al., 1984). Oxygen in body water derives from a combination of oxygen in \nfood and drink (itself mostly derived, directly or indirectly, from local precipitation) and \nbreathed atmospheric oxygen. Consequently, when \u03b418Obw is expressed as a linear function \nof \u03b418Odw, the gradient of the relationship is less than one (Luz et al., 1984). Enamel \ncarbonate and phosphate are in isotopic equilibrium with body water at 37 \u00baC at the time of \nformation but, as Bell et al. (2009: 168) rightly point out, the chemical routes differ, so that \nthe values are offset (Iacumin et al., 1996; Bryant et al., 1996; Martin et al., 2008). \n \nOther problems of interpretation become apparent with a closer examination of the data \nfrom the Mary Rose. The reported enamel \u03b418Ocarb values range between -6.7 and -3.2 \u2030 \nVPDB. However, contrary to Bell et al., the majority of individuals do not \u201ccluster around a \nvalue of about -5 to -6 \u2030\u201d (Bell et al., 2009: 171). In fact, only two of the 18 individuals \nfall within this range. The rest of the crew all have \u03b418Ocarb above -5 \u2030, with the exception \nof individual 6 who has a much more depleted enamel \u03b418Ocarb value of -6.7 \u2030. The \n\u03b418Opptn values in Great Britain range from about -5 \u2030 in the extreme west to -8.5 \u2030 in the \neast (Figure 2; Darling, 2004). If we accept Bell et al.\u201fs assumption that \u03b418Ocarb values \ndirectly reflect \u03b418Opptn, then strictly speaking only three of the 18 individuals from the \nMary Rose have values that are consistent with a British origin. However for the reasons \n5 \ngiven above, we believe that such a scenario is untenable and we suggest an alternative \ninterpretation. \nRe-interpreting the data \nSince oxygen isotopes fractionate as they are incorporated into body tissue some form of \ncalibration or correction is required before the measurements can be compared with \nenvironmental data. The existing calibrations relate phosphate oxygen isotope ratios to \ndrinking water ratios, so first a conversion from carbonate to phosphate is necessary. \nSeveral studies have investigated the fractionation between carbonate and phosphate \noxygen in mineralised tissues. Iacumin et al. (1996) found \u03b1=1.0090\u00b10.0007 (n=31), \nBryant et al. (1996) found \u03b1=1.0086\u00b10.0007 (n=42), and Martin et al. (2008) found \n\u03b1=1.0082\u00b10.0007 (22 measurements on two teeth); other, smaller, studies are summarised \nin Martin et al. (2008). Since the studies by Iacumin et al. (1996) and Bryant et al. (1996) \nhave the largest number of data points, they are probably the most reliable. Combining their \nreported values gives \u03b1=1.0088\u00b10.0005. \n \nThe relationship between human skeletal phosphate and drinking water has been \ncharacterised by several studies (Longinelli, 1984; Luz et al., 1984; Levinson et al., 1987). \nDaux et al. (2008) recently synthesised the data from these studies and we adopt their \nequation here. The equation of Daux et al. (2008) has an uncertainty of prediction of 0.5 \u2030, \nwhich combined in quadrature with the 0.5 \u2030 uncertainty on the carbonate-phosphate \nfractionation and the 0.2 \u2030 measurement uncertainty of Bell et al. (2009) gives a total \nuncertainty in a predicted drinking water value of 0.73 \u2030. On the basis of these \nfractionation and calibration factors, we obtain a range of \u03b418Odw for the Mary Rose men of \n6 \n-8.2 to -5.0 \u2030 (VSMOW) for the main group and -10.5 \u2030 for the outlier (individual 6 \nwhose value is 2.8 s.d. from the mean). The range of \u03b418Opptn values for the British Isles is \n-8.5 to -5.0 \u2030, from which it is clear that only the outlier is inconsistent with a British \norigin. \nConclusion \nWe have shown that the identification by Bell et al. (2009) of immigrants amongst the \nMary Rose crew is flawed because: \n1) There is no direct equivalence of \u03b418Ocarb VPDB and \u03b4\n18\nOpptn VSMOW as claimed \nby Bell et al. (2006); \n2) This claim contradicts established understanding of oxygen isotope systematics in \nthe human body, which requires the use of a calibration equation to obtain \u03b418Odw \nfrom \u03b418Ocarb; \n3) Even if this claim were true they have misinterpreted their own data by claiming a \ncluster of values around \u03b418Ocarb VPDB of -6 to -5 \u2030. \nWe show instead that: \n4) It is possible to relate \u03b418Ocarb to \u03b4\n18\nOdw by taking the published values for the \nfractionation between carbonate and phosphate oxygen in mineralised tissues, and \ncombined them with the calibration of Daux et al. (2008) relating phosphate values \nto drinking water; \n5) When this is done and compared to the range of British \u03b418Opptn, only one of the 18 \nMary Rose men has \u03b418Ocarb inconsistent with a British origin.  \n7 \nThus the hypothesis \u201cthat a significant proportion of the crew did indeed hail from more \nsouthern shores\u201d is neither supported nor refuted by the isotopic evidence. The \nidentifiable non-British sailor probably came from a more northerly or easterly area. \n8 \nReferences \nBell, L.S., Lee-Thorp, J.A., Dobney, K., 2006.
