The model and 27 \ndecision algorithm that underpin the DSS are described and their performance discussed.  The 28 \nmodel comprises: (i) seedling germination and emergence, (ii) early growth, (iii) phenological 29 \ndevelopment, (iv) herbicide and cultivation effects and (v) crop yield loss.  Crop and weed 30 \nemergence are predicted from the timing and method of cultivation, species biology, and the 31 \nweather.  Wheat and weeds compete for resources, and yield losses are predicted from their 32 \nrelative leaf area at canopy closure.  Herbicides and cultural control methods reduce weed 33 \ngreen area index, improving crop yield.  A decision algorithm identifies economically 34 \nsuccessful weed management strategies based on model output.  The output of the Weed 35 \nManager model and decision algorithm was extensively validated by experts, who confirmed 36 \nthe predicted responses to herbicide application were sufficiently accurate for practical use. 37 \nLimited independent data were also used in the validation. The development of the module 38 \nrequired integrating novel and existing approaches for simulating weed seedling 39 \nestablishment, plant development and decision algorithm design.  Combining these within 40 \nWeed Manager created a framework suitable for commercial use.  41 \n 42 \nKeywords: Emergence pattern, weed development, weed competition 43 \n  44 \n Page 3 of 36 \n1. Introduction 45 \nDecisions on weed control in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) should be a trade-46 \noff between economic impact of weeds and control cost.  Developing EU legislation 47 \n(Sustainable Use Directive) is likely to require that pesticide use should be based on a defined 48 \nneed for treatment (CRD, 2009a). The problem of control is complex because weed 49 \npopulation and growth varies between sites and years. Generally, weeds are controlled using a 50 \ncombination of cultivations and herbicides. Cultivations can be used to kill emerged weeds 51 \npre- or post-drilling or to stimulate a flush of weeds prior to drilling. Herbicide use is even 52 \nmore complex with many commercial products available. Each product targets a subset of 53 \nweed species with dose and timing affecting control. Products may be applied in mixture 54 \nand\/or sequence, in some cases with synergistic (or antagonistic) effects. Additionally, each 55 \nherbicide has legal restrictions which limit use to certain times, doses and tank mixtures. 56 \nSustainable weed management requires detailed understanding of weed populations, 57 \ntheir effect on yield and methods of control. Simulation models can facilitate this 58 \nunderstanding by combining expert knowledge with experimental data and by providing the 59 \nability to extrapolate to other years and sites.  Here we describe a model, which estimates 60 \nweed induced yield loss in a winter wheat crop, and its associated decision algorithm. The 61 \nmodel simulates the impact of weed control strategies on weed and crop green area index 62 \n(GAI), which in turn affects crop yield. The objective of the decision algorithm is to produce 63 \na list of alternative control strategies that maximise economic margin over weed control costs.  64 \nEmpirical models have been used to relate crop yield loss to weed density (Cousens, 65 \n1985; Pannel et al., 2004) or to early relative leaf areas of weeds and crop (Kropff et al., 1995; 66 \nvan Acker et al., 1997).  More complex ecophysiological models have also been developed, 67 \nwhich mechanistically simulate competition (Kropff and van Laar, 1993). The model 68 \npresented in this paper comprises an ecophysiological growth and development model, and an 69 \n Page 4 of 36 \nempirical yield loss model.  Where possible, established models were used to simulate the 70 \ndifferent processes, but it was also necessary to develop new approaches. For example, 71 \nherbicide efficacy depends on weed growth stage (GS). Crop GSs are also needed to 72 \naccommodate pesticide application restrictions, so models were required to predict 73 \nphenological development of both wheat and weeds.  Additionally, because the effectiveness 74 \nof herbicides changes with weed growth stage it was very important to simulate the protracted 75 \nemergence time of each weed species so that on any day a weed species is represented by 76 \ncohorts at a realistic range of growth stages. Without these the effect of herbicides would be 77 \npoorly estimated (Wiles et al., 1996). 78 \nSimulation models permit the investigation of many alternative weed control scenarios 79 \nbut the main focus of the presented models is to identify strategies that maximise economic 80 \nmargin because this is the primary interest of users.   An exhaustive search of all alternatives 81 \nwould be impractical because the search space is large. It is better to use an optimisation 82 \nalgorithm. Many techniques have been developed, such as the genetic algorithm used by 83 \nParsons and TeBeest (2004) to optimise winter wheat disease control, or dynamic 84 \nprogramming used by Benjamin et al. (2009) to optimise rotational weed control. In our case, 85 \nthe structure of the model and herbicide data meant the most practical approach was to 86 \ndevelop an efficient searching strategy based on expert knowledge of weed control, the form 87 \nof the model, and herbicide and cultivation data. The decision algorithm typically needs to run 88 \nthe model thousands of times, and so throughout the model development we guarded against 89 \nunnecessary complexity.  90 \nThe model and decision algorithm described here were developed for the \u201cWeed 91 \nManager\u201d decision support system (DSS) (Parsons et al. 2009).  This is the first DSS to focus 92 \non weed management in UK winter wheat, although cognizance was taken of other weed 93 \nDSSs (Wiles et al. 1996; Wilkerson et al., 2002; Berti et al., 2003; Rydahl, 2004; Pannell et 94 \n Page 5 of 36 \nal., 2004). All approach the problem in different ways depending on their scientific 95 \nbackground. Weed Manager was designed for farmers and advisors to investigate their own 96 \nweed control strategies. Through a graphical user interface (GUI) the user is able to explore 97 \nthe impact of their strategies on economic margin or receive a suggested range of treatments. 98 \nWeed Manager comprises a within-season module and a rotational module, which simulates 99 \nweed control over a rotation (Benjamin et al., 2009). The within-season module is designed so 100 \nthat it can be integrated with the rotational module. This is so that factors affecting the long 101 \nterm management of the weed seedbank (essential in any prudent weed control strategy) can 102 \nbe taken into account when planning weed control for the current season.  We return to this 103 \npoint in the discussion but throughout the description of our methods we focus on optimising 104 \nthe economic margin of the current crop. Weed Manager is part of ArableDS (Parsons et al., 105 \n2004) which is a suite of arable crop DSSs and encyclopaedias. This infrastructure provides 106 \nthe modules with information on pesticide cost, efficacy, mixture information and usage 107 \nrestrictions.  It contains local weather and farm data, enabling simulations to be site specific. 108 \nCopies of the program for Microsoft Windows\u00ae are available through 109 \nwww.weedmanager.co.uk, or from the authors. 110 \nIn this paper, we describe the within-season model and decision algorithm for the 111 \nwithin-season module of Weed Manager, and explore its performance. We parameterise the 112 \nmodels and test them against independent data.  Parameters were found for the following 113 \nweeds; Alopecurus myosuroides Huds. (black-grass), Stellaria media (L.) Vill. (chickweed), 114 \nGalium aparine L. (cleavers), Avena fatua L. (wild-oat), Anisantha sterilis (L.) Nevski 115 \n(barren brome), Lolium multiflorum Lam. (Italian ryegrass), Poa annua L. (annual meadow-116 \ngrass), Chenopodium album L. (fat hen), Papaver rhoeas L. (common poppy) and Polygonum 117 \naviculare L. (knotgrass), volunteer winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L. ssp. oleifera) and 118 \nvolunteer field beans (Vicia faba L.). 119 \n Page 6 of 36 \n 120 \n2.  Yield loss model 121 \n 122 \n 123 \n2.1 Overview of model structure 124 \n 125 \nThe model estimates weed induced yield loss in winter wheat for any given weed 126 \ncontrol scenario, and comprises five sub-models: (i) seedling germination and emergence, (ii) 127 \nearly growth, (iii) phenological development, (iv) herbicide and cultivation effects and (v) 128 \ncrop yield loss. Jointly, they simulate the growth and interaction of winter wheat and arable 129 \nweeds producing an estimate of the proportional yield loss (Fig. 1).  130 \nThe starting point for the weed growth simulation is an estimate of the seedbank.  This 131 \nis calculated from the anticipated weed density in the absence of weed control.  Users provide 132 \nthis weed plant density by choosing one of four, species-dependent, density ranges. These 133 \nanticipated densities are used to estimate the initial seedbank by back calculation, which 134 \nincludes adjustments to account for the influence of cultivation practices already carried out 135 \n(or planned).  The calculation of the proportion of seeds that emerge under given cultivation 136 \nsequences is described in Benjamin et al. (2009). 137 \nSeedling emergence is influenced by species, temperature, water, and seasonal 138 \nchanges in dormancy, which interact with seedbed preparation (Forcella, 1998; Finch-Savage  139 \net al. 1998). Crop emergence and growth are simulated as a single cohort of seedling 140 \nemergence at the user defined plant density (plants m\n-2\n). Weed species have a more protracted 141 \nemergence, which is modelled as a function of hydrothermal time (Finch-Savage et al., 1998).  142 \nHere we captured this variation by simulating eight cohorts emerging over a period of time.   143 \nThe simulation estimates daily growth stage (GS) and green area index (GAI) of the 144 \ncrop and weeds. This continues until the sum of the individual GAIs exceeds 0.75. This 145 \nmoment is defined as canopy closure. The ratio of the GAI of an individual weed species to 146 \nthe GAI of the crop and weeds at canopy closure is used to estimate the crop yield loss due to 147 \n Page 7 of 36 \nthat species (Kropff et al., 1995). The total weed induced yield loss is the sum of the yield 148 \nlosses attributed to each individual species. No competition between weed species is assumed, 149 \nwhich is a reasonable for most commercial conditions; and also makes the predictions 150 \n\u201econservative\u201f, over- rather than under-estimating yield losses. 151 \nThe effect of using herbicides and cultivations on yield loss is modelled by reducing 152 \nthe untreated GAI (calculated at canopy closure) for each weed. The size of the reduction 153 \ndepends on the product used, the dose and the weed cohort GS at the time of application.  154 \nAs it is not feasible to predict crop yield without taking into account numerous site 155 \nspecific factors that were beyond the scope of the project, we ask the user to provide an 156 \nestimate of yield in weed free conditions. Yield loss is calculated by scaling this value by the 157 \nmodel estimate of proportional yield loss.  158 \nIn the following sections we describe the model in more detail. 159 \n 160 \n2.2 Climate and astronomical data   161 \n 162 \nThe weeds and wheat emerge and grow as a function of daily weather variables and 163 \nday length. The weather variables, which are provided by the ArableDS environment, are 164 \nmaximum and minimum temperatures, radiation, rainfall and evapotranspiration.  The 165 \nemergence model uses temperature, rainfall, evapotranspiration and photoperiod.  The weed 166 \nand crop growth is modelled using radiation and temperature (as detailed below). Calculation 167 \nof photoperiod uses the ASTRO procedure and is based on time of year and latitude (Kropff 168 \nand van Laar, 1993).   Users can include their own weather data, or the system will provide 169 \ndata from the nearest national meteorological station. 170 \n 171 \n Page 8 of 36 \n2.3 Seedling emergence 172 \n 173 \nOur approach assumes the seedling emergence pattern is described by the logistic 174 \nEquation (1) given as a function of \u201cemergence-day-degrees\u201d accumulated after the initiation 175 \nof seedling emergence (the \u201cemergence trigger\u201d \u2013 see below) 176 \nt\ntx\nss\nd\nxDtn )(exp1\/1)(\n    (1)\n 177 \nwhere )(tns  is the proportion of seedlings that have emerged, t is day number, td is the 178 \nemergence trigger day, and  are species-dependent parameters, and Ds (t) is the 179 \nemergence day-degrees on day t.  The variable Ds  is defined 180 \n)()()()( tftftTtD dmds       (2) 181 \nwhere Td is the mean temperature above base ( 0\u00baC), fm is the  moisture factor and fd is the 182 \ndormancy factor (Forcella, 1998).  183 \nThe emergence trigger is defined either as harvest date of the previous crop or the date 184 \nof ploughing, if it has occurred. This is based on the assumption that ploughing buries and 185 \ndestroys seeds that have germinated and seedlings that have emerged, but brings another set 186 \nof seeds to the surface, which start to emerge. The model assumes that the number of seeds 187 \nbeing brought to the surface will be similar to the number buried.  This simplifying 188 \nassumption is made in the absence of field specific data on the distribution of seeds in the soil 189 \nprofile. Non-inversion cultivations have a less extreme effect on seed distribution in the soil 190 \nand so the emergence trigger of harvest date is retained where these cultivations are used.   191 \n 192 \n2.3.1 Soil moisture factor  193 \nThis assumes that soil moisture content is between the wilting point and field capacity.  194 \nAllen et al. (1998) reported that the difference in moisture content between these points was 195 \n Page 9 of 36 \nup to 0.2 m\n3 \nm\n-3\n for loams and clays. The model considers the top 100 mm, within which 196 \ngermination occurs, and assumes the soil is at wilting point at the emergence trigger.  We 197 \nmake this assumption because the trigger is either harvest or ploughing, which are typically 198 \nconducted in dry weather and the model is dealing with the layer of soil that dries most 199 \nrapidly. The model accumulates the difference between rainfall and potential 200 \nevapotranspiration (mm), constrained within the range 0 (wilting point) to 20 mm (field 201 \ncapacity). The soil moisture factor fm is 1.0 if the soil moisture value is greater than 5mm, 202 \notherwise it is 0.0.   203 \n 204 \n2.3.2 Dormancy factor  205 \nThe dormancy factor, fd, is a species-dependent function of the day of the year in the 206 \nrange 0 \u2013 1.  To define the dormancy factor, the numbers of seedlings established each month 207 \nwere taken from Mortimer (1990) (A. myosuroides, S. media, G. aparine, A. fatua, P. annua, 208 \nC. album, P. rhoeas and P. aviculare) and Froud-Williams (1983) (A. sterilis).  Lolium 209 \nmultiflorum was assumed to have the same dormancy characteristics as A. sterilis, whilst B. 210 \nnapus and V. faba have no dormancy.  For each species, the number emerging each month 211 \nwas expressed as a proportion of the total number of seedlings emerging per year. This 212 \nemergence pattern is the result of all of the factors in Equation (1), so several simplifying 213 \nassumptions were required to estimate the dormancy factor. The seasonal temperature and soil 214 \nmoisture cycles were not published for the Froud-Williams (1983) and Mortimer (1990) data, 215 \nso these were accounted for by standardising the emergence of each species using P. annua. 216 \nThis has no seasonally affected dormancy, so its monthly emergence pattern can be attributed 217 \nentirely to seasonal changes in soil temperature and soil moisture. For each month, the ratio of 218 \nemergence of P. annua in July (the month with the greatest emergence) to the monthly 219 \nemergence was taken as a weighting factor applied to the monthly proportional emergence of 220 \n Page 10 of 36 \nother weed species.  A cubic polynomial was fitted to these values for each species and the 221 \nslope of this cubic polynomial for any day of the year was scaled to lie in the range [0, 1], to 222 \ndefine the dormancy function 223 \n 224 \n2.3.3 Parameterising the emergence pattern equation  225 \n Seedling emergence counts for winter wheat, A. myosuroides, G. aparine and S. 226 \nmedia had been recorded at six sites, in three seasons, in a research project reported by Ingle 227 \net al. (1997) approximately weekly for 100 days after sowing, along with daily maximum and 228 \nminimum temperatures.  The drilling dates were late September or early October in all cases. 229 \nThe daily temperature, precipitation and evapotranspiration needed to calculate accumulated 230 \nemergence-day-degrees for the Ingle et al. (1997) data were provided by J. Storkey (personal 231 \ncommunication).   Equation (1) was fitted to each of the three species included in the \u201eIngle\u201f 232 \nexperiments separately using FITCURVE (Genstat, 2002) (Table 1). The range of 233 \ntemperatures during the experimental period was not sufficiently broad to allow the day-234 \ndegrees base temperature to be estimated accurately, and so it was assumed to be 0\no\nC 235 \n(estimated from Finch-Savage et al. (1998)).    The agreement between observed and fitted 236 \ndata was close (86, 88, 85 and 82% variance accounted for in adjusted R\n2\n for A. myosuroides, 237 \nS. media, G. aparine and wheat, respectively).  The data for A. myosuroides are presented in 238 \nFig. 2.  In the absence of species specific data for the other weed species, emergence was 239 \nextrapolated from the behaviour of these three; for example the grass weeds L. multiflorum, A. 240 \nsterilis and P. annua followed A. myosuroides. 241 \n 242 \n2.3.4 Implementing  emergence patterns in the model  243 \nThe model of emergence given by Equation (1) estimates the accumulated daily weed 244 \nseedling emergence. To model the subsequent development of each seedling would make the 245 \n Page 11 of 36 \nmodel run time unacceptably long. Therefore we simplified the method whilst still retaining 246 \nthe qualitative nature of the emergence patterns. For wheat, seedlings are assumed to emerge 247 \n emergence-day-degrees after sowing.  Weed emergence is simulated over a spread of time 248 \nby dividing the emergence period of each weed species into eight cohorts of equal density.  249 \nEight was judged to be the lowest number of cohorts that adequately captured the period of 250 \nemergence. The number of seedlings in each cohort is calculated by dividing the expected 251 \nnumber by the number of cohorts that emerge after drilling.  252 \nThe simulation accounts for seedbed preparation stimulating the emergence of weeds. 253 \nIn all preparation methods one cohort germinates at drilling and emerges 80 emergence-day-254 \ndegrees later (Finch-Savage et al. 1998). The other seven cohorts germinate at specified 255 \nintervals from the emergence-trigger (based on the theoretical emergence pattern above).  256 \nThe accumulated emergence-day-degrees, )(iHe , between the emergence-trigger and 257 \nemergence date for each cohort (i = 2, \u20268) is defined by rearranging Equation (1) to give  258 \n)1(\n)1(1\nln\n1\n)(\nif\nif\niH e      (3) 259 \nwhere for direct drill 0.875)  0.75 0.625, 0.5, 0.375, 0.25, 0.125,()(if . For other cultivation 260 \nsequences (ploughing and non-inversion cultivation) the soil disturbance breaks the dormancy 261 \nof some seeds bringing forward germination of cohorts i = 3,\u2026,8. For simplicity we assume 262 \nthat cohort 3 emerges at the same time as cohort 2 and cohorts 4 \u2013 8 emerge when cohorts 3 \u2013 263 \n7 would under a direct drill scenario, thus 0.75). 0.625, 0.5, 0.375, 0.25, 0.125, 0.125, ()(if   264 \n 265 \n2.4 Phenological development  266 \nHerbicide efficacy depends on weed GS, and pesticide application restrictions are 267 \noften given in terms of the GS of the crop. Although growth was only simulated up to canopy 268 \nclosure, herbicides could be applied throughout the season from drilling to harvest.  Therefore 269 \n Page 12 of 36 \nwe needed to model the phenological development of weeds and crop up until maturity. We 270 \nused the Zadoks GS scale for graminaceous weeds and wheat (Zadoks et al., 1974). Growth 271 \nstages from GS30 to maturity (GS92) are defined by Milne et al. (2003).  The beginning of 272 \ngermination (Hg) (GS0), is defined in emergence-day-degrees by 273 \n0,0.80)(max)( iHiH eg      (4)  274 \nBetween germination and the day of emergence (ts) the GS (Z) on day t is  275 \ns\ngg\nt\nts\nt\nts\nsDsDZ )(\/)(10      (5) 276 \nwhere D is day-degrees. After emergence, 10Z  until the first leaf is formed.  A new leaf 277 \nappears when the accumulated day degrees from the appearance of the previous leaf exceed 278 \nthe species specific phyllochron.  The value of Z increases from 11 to 14 with the appearance 279 \nof first to fourth leaf. Once four leaves have been produced tillering commences (GS21\u201329). 280 \nTillers appear every 100 day \no\nC (based on expert opinion) until main stem extension (GS 30) 281 \nis initiated. 282 \nA similar approach is taken for broad-leaved weeds with GSs after emergence based 283 \non the number of leaves on the entire plant.  Unlike graminaceous weeds, branching (the 284 \nequivalent of tillering) does not directly affect the GS code.  The number of leaves produced 285 \nper phyllochron may be more than one (e.g. a pair of opposite leaves).  Flower buds are 286 \nproduced when a species-specific number of day degrees have accumulated. 287 \n 288 \n2.5 Growth and competition 289 \n 290 \nThe growth of each species from emergence to canopy closure is simulated using the 291 \necophysiological model INTERCOM (Kropff and van Laar, 1993).  The height and leaf area 292 \nof the crop and weeds determine their daily light interception, and the consequent increase in 293 \ndry matter is partitioned to the different plant organs. The increase in GAI is calculated from 294 \n Page 13 of 36 \nthe specific leaf area.  The initial GAI of each weed cohort and the crop is based on the green 295 \narea per seedling at the time of full hypocotyl or cotyledon expansion and density.  Where this 296 \ninitial seedling green area is not known the value is estimated as the product of: for grasses, 297 \nthe green area per A. myosuroides seedling (35 mm\n2\n) and the ratio of the species seed weight 298 \nto the seed weight of A. myosuroides (1.1 mg); and for broad-leaved species, the product of 299 \nthe green area per S. media seedling (31 mm\n2\n) and the ratio of the species seed weight to the 300 \nseed weight of S. media (0.8 mg) (Storkey, 2001). 301 \nPhotosynthate supply or temperature can limit plant growth (Benjamin and Park, 302 \n2007).  To estimate which of these is most limiting, daily increase in GAI is calculated in two 303 \nways: firstly, from the above calculations of dry matter (based on INTERCOM) and secondly 304 \nfrom a simple temperature based exponential model (Storkey and Cussans, 2000).  The daily 305 \nincrease in GAI is taken as the lower of the two values.  For weed species that are not winter 306 \nhardy, there is a daily loss of 90% of total GAI whenever the minimum air temperature falls 307 \nbelow -5\no\nC. This is necessary to ensure the model does not predict yield loss from autumn-308 \nemerging weeds that do not survive British winters.  309 \nThe simulation commences on the date of emergence of the first cohort of the weed or 310 \nthe crop (which ever is the earliest), and further weed cohorts are included as the simulation 311 \nproceeds to canopy closure (GAI = 0.75).   312 \n 313 \n2.6 Crop yield loss 314 \n 315 \nThe yield loss (t ha \n-1\n) associated with a weed species is  316 \n)1(1 qL\nYqL\nY\nw\nw\nL      (6) 317 \nwhere Y is crop yield (t ha \n-1\n) in weed-free conditions, q is the weed species dependent 318 \ndamage coefficient.  Lw is  319 \n Page 14 of 36 \ncw\nw\nw\nGAIGAI\nGAI\nL      (7) 320 \n 321 \n(Kropff et al., 1995), where GAIw is the GAI of weed w and GAIc is the crop GAI at canopy 322 \nclosure.  Values for q were derived from our own experiments and from the published 323 \nliterature and were 2.55 for A. myosuroides, 0.6 for S media and 23.9 for G. aparine.  The 324 \nweeds are assumed to act independently of one another. That is to say, it is assumed that one 325 \nweed\u201fs growth does not suffer from the competitive effects of another. Therefore, the total 326 \nweed-induced yield loss is calculated as the sum of the yield losses attributed to each weed 327 \nspecies. The total yield loss is not allowed to exceed the weed-free crop yield.   328 \n 329 \n2.7 Weed control (herbicide and cultivation effects) 330 \n 331 \nThe effect of using herbicides and\/or mechanical cultivations on yield loss is modelled 332 \nby reducing the untreated GAI of each weed cohort calculated at canopy closure. The 333 \nreduction depends on the product (the term \u201cproduct\u201d includes cultivations and herbicides) 334 \nefficacy.  The efficacy e of a product against a weed cohort will depend on the weed species, 335 \nthe dose applied and the GS of the cohort at the time of application. The model of herbicide 336 \ncontrol is not mechanistic.  The effect of each weed control measure, be it conducted before 337 \nor after canopy closure, is reflected in a reduction in GAI at canopy closure.  The effect of 338 \ntiming of control on yield is implicit in the efficacy.  In the majority of cases, late application 339 \nwill result in reduced efficacy.  Therefore, the model will favour early treatment, but there 340 \nwill be a bias towards some under-prediction of yield loss at later applications because the 341 \nmodel does not fully account for greater duration of weed competition.  342 \n The product efficacy data are stored in a database which is accessed by the model. 343 \nThey take a similar form to herbicide label data, with efficacies given for fixed doses against 344 \n Page 15 of 36 \nweed species at consecutive GS ranges. For grass weeds the Zadoks GS ranges are 70 , 345 \n108 , 1311 , 2114 , 2922 , 3130 , 3932 , 4540  and 9346 ; for broad-leaved 346 \nweeds the ranges are pre-emergence, pre-emergence \u2013 cotyledons, cotyledons \u2013 2 leaves, 347 \n42 , 64 , 86 , and 8 leaves \u2013 flowering. The efficacies are categorised as resistant, 348 \nmoderately resistant, moderately sensitive, sensitive and complete kill, mapping to e=0.01, 349 \n0.51, 0.76, 0.91 and 1.0, respectively. These values are similar to those published by CRD 350 \n(2009b) for herbicide registration.  Published and unpublished (but manufacturer supported) 351 \nproduct information was used to assign efficacies to each weed species, GS and product 352 \ncombination (D. H. K. Davies, personal communication). 353 \n  If a single product is applied to a weed, the treated GAI of the jth cohort is obtained by 354 \nmultiplying the untreated GAI by the product efficacy, e. If a product mixture is applied it is 355 \ntreated in one of two ways. If the product mixture (including product plus adjuvant) is known 356 \nto be synergistic then the combination is treated as a pseudo product with its own efficacy 357 \ndata. Otherwise the combined efficacy E, of products either in mixture, sequence or both is 358 \ncalculated by: 359 \n)1(1\n1\nn\ni\nieE       (8) 360 \nwhere ie  is the efficacy of the \nthi  product against the weed cohort at the GS at which it was 361 \napplied, and n is the number of products in the control programme.  362 \n 363 \n2.8 Variability 364 \n 365 \nThere is always some uncertainty in prediction. This is due to, among other factors, 366 \nerror in the seedbank estimation and unknown future weather. Therefore the model prediction 367 \nof weed induced yield loss is presented to the user as a range of values, indicating the 368 \n Page 16 of 36 \nvariability associated with the prediction.  We assume that most variability arises from 369 \nuncertainty associated with estimating weed and crop density.  The users define the weed and 370 \ncrop populations from a set of density ranges.  The mean expected yield loss is calculated 371 \nusing the means of the density ranges for weed and crop.  The greatest\/least possible yield 372 \nloss is calculated using the lower\/upper bound of the crop density and the upper\/lower bound 373 \nof the weed density.   374 \n 375 \n3. The decision algorithm 376 \n 377 \nThe decision algorithm suggests a list of the most robust weed control strategies for a 378 \ngiven scenario. The scenario comprises weather, site, sowing date, weed list and any 379 \ncultivations and herbicides applied to date in the season.  380 \nThe algorithm incorporates rules on cultivation practices and timing and dose of 381 \nherbicides, ensuring only legally acceptable and practical strategies are suggested. These rules 382 \nare either \u201crestrictions data\u201d, which are part of the legal registration process, or 383 \n\u201crecommendations for effective use\u201d and are defined by the herbicide manufacturers and 384 \nmarketers.  Most are on the product label.  Restrictions and recommendations data contain 385 \n\u201cdo not mix\u201d rules prohibiting dangerous or antagonistic tank mixes. There are also 386 \nrestrictions on pre-sowing sequences of cultivations to ensure an appropriately prepared 387 \nseedbed.  All of the above rules are contained in the ArableDS and Weed Manager databases. 388 \nEach cultivation and herbicide programme is validated against the rules.  389 \nThe decision algorithm aims to maximise the margin, M, over weed control costs  390 \nCHL PPgYYM )(     (9) 391 \n Page 17 of 36 \nwhere Y is the expected weed-free crop yield, YL is the weed induced yield loss, g is the grain 392 \nprice, HP  is the cost of the herbicide programme and cP  is the cost of the cultivation 393 \nprogramme.  394 \n To ensure the algorithm reaches a solution within a few minutes (a time acceptable to 395 \nusers) the slowest parts of the model are run as few times as possible (otherwise reaching a 396 \nsolution could take several hours).  These are calculating emergence patterns and growth to 397 \ncanopy closure. The emergence pattern depends on the pre\u2013sowing cultivation programme 398 \n(see Fig. 1) and once the pattern is established subsequent weed control treatments have no 399 \neffect on GS estimates. The decision algorithm exploits this by minimising the number of 400 \ncultivation combinations to be tested and calculating the growth stages for each only once. 401 \nIf the sowing date is prior to the current date, then it follows that the pre-sowing 402 \ncultivation programme has been defined by the user. Otherwise, the suggested control 403 \nstrategies include pre-sowing cultivations. To minimise the number of cultivation 404 \ncombinations tested, the system selects up to three pre-sowing cultivation programmes 405 \n(described below). For each cultivation programme the model is run to canopy closure and the 406 \nuntreated GAIs are stored. A list of valid herbicide and post-sowing cultivation programmes 407 \nis generated (described below) and their effects on the weed GAI are calculated using 408 \nEquation (8). These are applied to the untreated GAI and the revised GAIs are used to 409 \ncalculate the weed induced yield loss (Equation 6) and margin (Equation 9). The weed control 410 \nprogrammes are sorted to remove poor solutions and repetitions of very similar programmes 411 \nand the top 20 are presented to the user. This produces a short list of diverse solutions.  412 \n 413 \n3.1 Defining the pre-sowing cultivation programme  414 \n 415 \n Page 18 of 36 \nThe system contains data for eight pre-sowing cultivations (mouldboard plough, 416 \nspring tine, harrows, rollers, powered harrows, heavy tines, discs, heavy disc) as well as 417 \ndrilling and direct drilling. These are used in combination to prepare the seed bed and sow the 418 \nwheat. We term such a series of activities a pre-sowing cultivation programme. If the current 419 \ndate is before sowing and the user has not identified any preferred options, a maximum of 420 \nthree pre-sowing cultivation programmes are selected: nominally non-inversion, ploughing 421 \nand direct drill. The non-inversion sequence starts with the primary cultivation (1) on the day 422 \nafter the current date and follows this with secondary cultivation (2) on the day before 423 \ndrilling. The first cultivation stimulates weed emergence and the second removes many of 424 \nthose that have emerged. Hence the maximum amount of time is left between cultivations 425 \n(Pannell et al., 2004). This sequence is run for all valid combinations of cultivations 1 and 2 426 \n(tested against database information on timing and which combinations of cultivations 427 \nacceptably prepare the seedbed). The cultivation plan that gives the highest margin defines the 428 \nnon-inversion programme. For ploughing, cultivation 1 is mouldboard plough two days 429 \nbefore drilling (removing most of the germinated weeds) and cultivation 2 is harrowing the 430 \nnext day. The direct drill programme sows the crop without any pre-sowing soil cultivations. 431 \nIf primary cultivations have already been done these effectively define cultivation 1 and only 432 \ncultivation 2 is selected by the algorithm. In this case, the model is run with all valid options 433 \nfor cultivation 2 and the one that gives the highest margin is selected.  As stated above this 434 \nmethod results in a maximum of three different pre-sowing cultivation programmes, which 435 \nare taken forward and investigated with valid herbicide combinations as described below.  To 436 \nensure the optimisation reaches a solution in a few minutes it was necessary to define the 437 \ntimings for the non-inversion and ploughing sequences. These were based on one of several 438 \npossible practical approaches. The chosen timings will not be the best in all scenarios, but will 439 \n Page 19 of 36 \nproduce robust solutions. The users are still able to define other sequences that can be taken 440 \nforward to the next step of the optimisation should they wish to. 441 \n 442 \n3.2 Defining the herbicide and post-sowing cultivation programme  443 \n 444 \nThere are many herbicide products available and users can, if they wish, limit the 445 \nherbicide selection by only including products that are available on their farms.  The season is 446 \nsplit into four consecutive treatment periods; \u201cpre-emergence\u201d (before wheat GS 9), \u201cautumn\u201d 447 \n(between GS 9 and 1\nst\n January), \u201cspring\u201d (between 1st January and GS 90) and \u201cdesiccant\u201d 448 \n(period after GS 90). In each period there is only one application of product\/mixtures. In each 449 \nperiod the timing for each product\/mixture that gives the least yield loss is evaluated and 450 \nsaved to a list.  The lists are reduced by removing products\/mixtures that have lower efficacy 451 \nagainst the target weeds than cheaper products\/mixtures in the list. All valid combinations of 452 \nthe reduced lists are evaluated forming a list of \u201cviable programmes\u201d, and up to 20 of the best 453 \nperforming programmes are presented to the user (as described above).  454 \n 455 \n4. Model validation  456 \n 457 \nSome experimental data were available but these were insufficient to validate the 458 \nmodel and decision algorithm fully, so much of the validation was done using expert 459 \nagronomic opinion. Field and research weed scientists associated with the project but not 460 \ndirectly involved in model development, examined a wide range of outcomes from the model, 461 \nwith the different weed species, cultivation practices and herbicides, and assessed whether the 462 \npredictions were agronomically sound.  This resulted in many improvements.  Several 463 \nindependent data sets from the UK were also found that could be used for partial validation. 464 \n Page 20 of 36 \nThese included published papers and unpublished research carried out by consortium 465 \nmembers.  The work focused on assessing predicted crop yields arising from uncontrolled 466 \ninfestations of target weeds, as these responses were more likely to identify problems with the 467 \npredictions but some herbicide performance data were also identified.   468 \n Independent data were found for S. media, G. aparine, A. fatua and A. myosuroides.  469 \nAs far as possible, the published agronomic data were used as the basis for the predictions.  470 \nAs these data spanned several decades, we were unable to access the associated weather data.  471 \nConsequently, we used standardised ArableDS regional climatic data (Parsons et al., 2009).  472 \n 473 \n4.1 Predicting yield losses from uncontrolled weeds 474 \n 475 \n4.1.1 Broad-leaved weeds (S. media and G. aparine)  476 \nWheat yield responses to S. media were determined from three experiments (Lutman 477 \nunpublished data, 2006).  The model consistently over-estimated the crop response to 478 \ncompetition from this weed, especially at higher densities at Rothamsted (Table 2).    The two 479 \nexperiments on G. aparine showed contrasting yield responses (Wright and Wilson, 1992).  In 480 \ntrial Bristol 1, there was little yield loss from the weed, whilst the model predicted 481 \nconsiderable losses.  Wright and Wilson commented on the surprising lack of yield loss from 482 \nthe G. aparine and attributed this to a summer drought that reduced its competitive effect.  In 483 \ncontrast, in Bristol 2 the yield losses were higher and within the range the model predicted.  484 \n 485 \n4.1.2 Grass weeds (A. fatua and A. myosuroides)   486 \nTwo experiments (Oxford 1 and 2) measured the response of winter wheat to 487 \ncompetition from A. myosuroides (Wilson, 1980).  In Oxford 1, predicted yield loss was close 488 \nto the actual response (Table 2), whilst in Oxford 2 it was less than predicted.  Wilson 489 \n Page 21 of 36 \nattributes the low yield loss in Oxford 2 to the \u201eprofuse late summer vigour of the wheat\u201f.  In 490 \nthe four A. fatua experiments, the model was within 0.6 t ha\n-1\n in two experiments (Bristol 4 491 \nand Oxford 4), underestimated the response in Bristol 3 and overestimated it in Oxford 3 492 \n(Wilson et al., 1990; Wright and Wilson, 1992). The two Oxford data sets were from the same 493 \nexperiment, but with differing crop densities.  The results suggest the model was overreacting 494 \nto the low crop density in Oxford 3 and if it is increased by one band (i.e. from 100\u2013149 to 495 \n150\u2013199 wheat plants m-2) the predictions are much closer to the actual yields.  The more 496 \npronounced yield losses in the Bristol 3 experiment, which was done in the same season as 497 \nBristol 1, may also be associated with the summer drought, as the crop was unable to 498 \ncompensate for the early competition exerted by the A. fatua. 499 \n 500 \n4.2 Evaluation of predicted crop yield responses to the control of A.myosuroides  501 \n 502 \nThe previously discussed experiments on A. myosuroides (Wilson, 1980) also included results 503 \nfrom November applications of isoproturon.  These achieved good weed control and yields 504 \nincreased (Table 3).    Predictions for Oxford 1 were within 0.7 t ha\n-1\n of the observed yield 505 \nand those for Oxford 2 continued to over-estimate yield losses (as discussed above).   506 \n A third experiment evaluated herbicidal control of metabolic resistant A. myosuroides 507 \nat ADAS (Boxworth).  It compared three treatments (classed as early, late and full) and an 508 \nuntreated control.  The model under-estimated the yield loss in the absence of weed control, 509 \nbut predictions improved with increased control.  The prediction with the least effective 510 \n(early) treatment was least accurate, reflecting the under-estimate of the response of the 511 \nuntreated.   512 \n 513 \n5. Discussion 514 \n Page 22 of 36 \n 515 \nThe model and decision algorithm were developed for the Weed Manager DSS, and 516 \nthis purpose determined their design. It meant achieving a balance between being sufficiently 517 \ncomplex so that key parts of the biological mechanism were described, parsimony and model 518 \nrun times of a few seconds (important for the decision algorithm). Established models were 519 \nused where possible. For example, yield loss was based on well-established models relating 520 \nyield loss to relative crop and leaf area (Kropff et al., 1995) and seedling emergence was 521 \nbased on hydrothermal models of seedling establishment (Finch-Savage et al., 1998; Forcella, 522 \n1998).  However, it was also necessary to develop new modelling approaches to certain 523 \naspects of weed development: for example, the effect of seed dormancy, spread of weed 524 \nseedling emergence, and growth stage progression. Where sufficient data were not available 525 \nto define parameters for the novel parts of the model, expert opinion and logical extrapolation 526 \nwere used. In particular there were insufficient data to estimate the day-degree requirement 527 \nfor seed germination and seedling emergence or their base temperatures and, for some 528 \nspecies, initial seedling green area.  Similarly, the stimulation of seedling emergence due to 529 \nsoil disturbance was simulated by advancing a cohort to be a specified thermal time after 530 \nseedbed preparation.  Since the time of development of the DSS new data have become 531 \navailable (J. Storkey, personal communication) and so it may now be possible to estimate 532 \nthese parameters more accurately.  Our concerns to minimise runtime led to the pragmatic 533 \ndecision to base estimates of yield loss on the relative calculated GAI of the crop and the 534 \nweed at canopy closure.  It would have been biologically sounder to incorporate the impact of 535 \nthe time of control on weed competition more mechanistically, but with computer power at 536 \nthe time of development was impractical.  Increased computer power in the future may 537 \nprovide opportunities to re-evaluate this.  Despite these shortcomings, expert assessment of 538 \nthe models concluded that they performed sufficiently well and were fit for purpose.  539 \n Page 23 of 36 \n  For legal liability reasons, the system uses only approved recommended rates of 540 \nherbicide products. Therefore, dose flexibility is not as great as in some other weed DSSs 541 \n(e.g. Rydahl, 2004). An advantage of our method is that herbicide parameter updates are 542 \nstraightforward, as they can be extracted from labels. However, this approach requires a large 543 \nnumber of herbicide product parameters, unlike the more parsimonious approach of 544 \nparameterising active ingredients (see Milne et al., 2007). 545 \nThe decision algorithm also proved an unwitting critic of the model as, during the 546 \nsystem development, it suggested mathematically correct, but biologically flawed solutions. 547 \nThis led to an improved description of biological mechanisms important to weed control, in 548 \nparticular, the need to account for the protracted emergence of weed species.  The decision 549 \nalgorithm was tested by experts who concluded the results were sound (Parsons et al., 2009).  550 \nThe field trials indicate that in the absence of weed control, the model tends to over-551 \nestimates yield losses from weeds. However, because of large variation in the data we are 552 \ncautious with our conclusions. Taking into account the variability in the field data, yield 553 \nlosses were over-estimated in five trials, under-estimated in two and were reasonably accurate 554 \nin four.  The over-estimation mainly affected the S. media results and this systematic error 555 \nrequires attention.  From a farming viewpoint, this over-estimation is a lesser error, as it is 556 \nrisk averse.  In three of the 11 trials, extreme summer weather resulted in poor predictions of 557 \nyield loss, as they had influenced the competitive characteristics of the species concerned.  558 \nThe drought in experiments B1 and B3 had had contrasting effects.  It had reduced the 559 \ncompetitive effect of G. aparine, as this late maturing species was unable to develop its 560 \nnormally highly competitive canopy in late summer.  In contrast the drought increased the 561 \ncompetitive impact of A. fatua, as this earlier maturing species was able to exert its full 562 \ncompetitive impact on the crop, whilst the crop was unable to recover in the latter part of the 563 \nsummer.  These issues highlight problems associated with predicting yield loss early in the 564 \n Page 24 of 36 \nseason, when variable weather events ensue.  Weed Manager is designed to be run throughout 565 \nthe season, with weather data and weed observation updates. Consequently, as the season 566 \nprogresses, predictions should improve. The limited validations of herbicide performance 567 \n(Table 3) indicate that where weed control is high the model\u201fs predictive ability is better than 568 \nin the absence of control. This is encouraging because we would expect the variability in 569 \nresponse to herbicide treatment to reduce with increased control, and so should be more 570 \naccurate. 571 \nThe within-season module discussed in this paper has been presented as a decision 572 \nsupport module that is concerned only with the current cropping season. This is often not the 573 \nmost practical approach and weed control should ideally take a more long term view if the 574 \nweed seedbank is to be kept at a manageable level. This is the focus of the rotational module 575 \n(Benjamin et al 2009), which accompanies the within-season module in the Weed Manager 576 \nDSS. The two systems have been designed to be compatible. The long term module can be 577 \nused to estimate the percentage kill needed to keep a weed at a manageable level over a 578 \nrotation. The within-season module estimates the expected kill of each weed under a given 579 \nscenario and displays it to the user so that they can see if their targets have been met. In future 580 \ndevelopments we plan that the user will be able to define a minimum percentage kill (for 581 \nexample that suggested by the rotational system) that the optimisation algorithm must aim to 582 \nachieve. Solutions which do not achieve this target will be removed from the list of viable 583 \nprogrammes (described above).  584 \nWeed Manager was developed as a tactical DSS for farmers and advisors but also has 585 \neducational value, illustrating the complex interactions between weed biology, cultivation 586 \npractices and weed control.  For example, the within-season module provides a valuable tool 587 \nto explore and illustrate the complex interactions between the range of development stages of 588 \nweeds, their competitive effects and vulnerability to control measures.  Development is still 589 \n Page 25 of 36 \nneeded, to increase the number of weeds and to validate the results of the species currently 590 \nincluded.  591 \n 592 \nAcknowledgements 593 \n 594 \n 595 \nDefra (through Sustainable Arable LINK LK0916) sponsored this project, with 596 \nHGCA, BASF, Bayer CropScience, Dow AgroSciences, DuPont, and Syngenta.
