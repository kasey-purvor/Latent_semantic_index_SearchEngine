Annals of Applied Biology, 147, 161-\n172.\n* Corresponding Author E-mail: eric.audsley@bbsrc.ac.uk\n2Introduction\nFor foliar diseases of wheat, the extent and duration of disease-induced loss of green\nlamina area is the main determinant of yield loss (Waggoner & Berger, 1987; Bryson et\nal., 1997; Paveley, 1999) and hence the need for fungicide treatment (Paveley et al.,\n2001). Here we describe a model of foliar disease progress which can be coupled with\nthe wheat canopy model described by Milne et al. (2003) - using green canopy area as\nthe coupling point (Boote et al., 1983) \u2013 to form part of a decision support system for\nfungicide treatment decisions. This use imposes certain requirements and constraints on\nmodel structure, which are considered below.\nShoemaker (1984) reviewed potential modelling approaches to determining the\noptimal timing of applications of pesticides and noted that simulation approaches are\nappropriate where, as in many agricultural systems, there are large numbers of variables.\nHowever, simulation models were considered inappropriate where there are large\nnumbers of possible pesticide treatments and timings. This limitation can be overcome\nby interfacing the coupled crop-disease simulation model with a decision algorithm,\nsuch as the one described by Parsons & Te Beest (2004). However, such an algorithm\nmay still need to run the model thousands of times, Hence, model complexity (and\ntherefore run time) must be minimised.\nThe need for fungicide treatment is commonly determined by more than one foliar\ndisease and the progress of each disease is determined by multiple \u2018risk variables\u2019\n(Paveley, 1999). One approach to constrain model complexity would be to use a generic\nmodel structure, which is then parameterised specifically for each of the diseases which\nmost commonly cause substantial economic loss. In the UK, these are Septoria tritici,\nanamorph of Mycosphaerella graminicola (leaf blotch), Puccinia striiformis (yellow\nrust), Erysiphe graminis (powdery mildew) and Puccinia triticina (brown rust). The\nmost important risk variables for each disease could then be accounted for and the\ndiseases considered as competing for the same susceptible green canopy area.\nThe timing of disease development and the efficacy of fungicide treatment are both\nsubstantially determined by the emergence and expansion of successive \u2018layers\u2019 of culm\nleaves which form the upper crop canopy (Paveley et al., 2000). Hence, the model\nshould quantify disease progress, and consequent green area loss, by leaf layer.\nFungicide active ingredients differ in their systemicity and efficacy against different\nstages of the pathogen life cycle. Specifically, some are only active against spores\nwhich arrive after treatment (protectant action), whereas others can prevent the\nexpression of symptoms from latent infections (eradicant action) (Vyas, 1984). Hence,\nthe model needs to partition pathogen growth (for instance, by date of infection), so that\neradicant and protectant effects can be accounted for separately, rather than treating the\nepidemic as a single function (O\u2019Callaghan et al., 1994).\nWhen used for making tactical decisions during the growing season, user observations\nof disease severity can update model predictions of disease progress at key crop growth\nstages for fungicide treatment decisions, in order to correct for errors and omissions in\nthe modelling. However, disease observations are subject to uncertainty (Parker et al.\n1995). Hence the model should account for user observations in a way which allows for\nerror in the observations. Kranz et al. (1984) pointed out that acceptance of models for\npractical use, provided they are sufficiently reliable, depends on the simplicity of input\nacquisition. Observations of disease need to be achievable by untrained observers and\n3meteorological variables should be readily available in electronic form from synoptic\nstations.\nMany methods have been proposed to describe, simulate or analyse botanical\nepidemics (for example, Jeger, 1984; Teng, 1985; Waggoner, 1986; Campbell &\nMadden, 1990; Rossi et al., 1997; Yang, 1997; Segarra et al., 2001). Many of these\napproaches are intended to improve understanding rather than decision making. Here\nwe describe a model designed to meet the requirements and constraints for use in farm\npractice to enhance decision making concerning the control of important cereal diseases.\nModel Structure\nYield loss from disease is proportional to disease-induced green area loss from the\nupper canopy, hence the model describes disease on the top six leaves of the canopy\nwhich intercept the photosynthetically active radiation which is important for yield\n(Bryson et al., 1997). When describing how a single leaf layer becomes infected it is\nreferred to here as the \u2018target\u2019 leaf, with leaf layers numbered downward from the flag\nleaf (leaf one). The processes described by the functions below are taken to apply to all\nthe foliar diseases modelled, unless a particular disease is specified in the text. Only the\nmost important risk variables for each disease are modelled.\nDisease growth on a leaf\nThe simulation calculates disease progress in daily time steps. On day t, a number of\ninfections occur on the leaf, which results in lesion growth. The unit of infection is the\npercentage of the fully developed green leaf area potentially covered by lesions. Lesion\ngrowth from an infection is modelled by a logistic function of thermal time:\nd\nd\ny\nT\nky y\uf03d \uf02d( )1 with y(0)=a, (1)\nwhere y is lesion size, expressed as a proportion of its asymptote value, at thermal time\nT (\u00b0C days, base zero). A negative base temperature has been suggested for S. tritici\n(Lovell et al., 2004). At the temperature common during the life of the upper canopy\nthe error in adopting a 0\u00b0C days, base temperature is relatively small. The latent period\nof an infection is taken as the time it takes to reach 5% of its potential size (asymptote).\nAt this stage lesions are considered to become both infectious and visible as symptoms.\nHence, lesion growth represents percentage symptom severity and the upper asymptote\nrepresents potential symptom severity. Because the asymptote value cannot be observed\nin practice, the maximum observed severity of disease is taken to be 90% of the\nasymptote value. Given these boundary conditions k (rate parameter) and a can be\nestimated from disease measurements.\nPercentage symptom severity Y(t, l), on leaf l, on day t, is then the sum of lesion\ngrowth from all infections which have occurred up to that point in time,\n\uf028 \uf029Y t l I i l y T t T i\ni\nt\n( , ) ( , ) ( ) ( )\uf03d \uf02d\n\uf03d\n\uf0e5\n1\n(2)\nwhere I(i, l) is the number of successful infections occurring on day i on leaf l, and T(t)-\nT(i ) is the accumulated thermal time over the period i to t.\nInfection\nUntil a leaf reaches 5% of its maximum area it is assumed to be enclosed in the sheath\nof the preceding leaf, so no infections can occur.\n4Inoculum source\nFor the biotrophic diseases, initial infection of a crop can occur in the autumn by long\ndistance airborne dispersal, but dispersal is more efficient over short distances.\nInfections develop slowly over the winter and can be subject to loss due to frosts.\nHence, the level of inoculum expressed in the spring can be an important risk factor\n(Young et al., 2003). Inoculum generated on the lower leaves is assumed to be the\npredominant source of infection of the upper leaves, so the source of inoculum consists\nof infectious lesions in the canopy. To initiate the simulated disease growth of the P.\nstriiformis, P. triticina and E. graminis, a small quantity of disease Is is assigned to leaf\n6, to form the spring inoculum. The value is calculated from users local observations of\nthe previous seasons\u2019 disease severity and modified by any disease observations in the\ncurrent season (see later). As infection is known to be inoculum density dependent, the\nrelationship between potential infections U(t, l) and infectious symptom area Y(t, l) on\nleaf l is\n\uf028 \uf029U t l a Y t l Y ls( , ) ( , ) ( )\uf03d \uf02d \uf02d \uf02b \uf02d1 6e \uf064 (3)\nwhere \u03b4(l-6) is the Kronecker delta function which is zero except when l = 6, when it\nequals one.\nIn the case of S. tritici, emerging crops become infected by long distance dispersal in\nthe autumn and winter. Subsequently, the predominant inoculum is in the form of\nasexual spores produced on infectious lesions, initially on the rosette leaves (Shaw &\nRoyle, 1993). Sporulation can continue after leaves have senesced. Hence, the spring\ninoculum in the model is represented as a \u2018ground source\u2019 Ug, as opposed to a small\nlevel of disease on leaf 6.\nInoculum transfer\nThe number of spores reaching a target leaf decreases logarithmically with distance\nfrom the inoculum source (Shaw, 1987). The distance between source and target leaf is\ncalculated from an estimate of the height of the leaves. Leaves 5 and 6 are assumed to\napproximate to ground level. Leaves 1 to 4 are assumed to be at a height of 10(4-n) cm\nat the point of emergence (where n is the leaf number) after which they increase in\nheight at a rate of 1cm per 10 \u00b0C days until they reach a height of 10(5-n) cm.\nAs a simplification it is assumed that disease only spreads up the plant, because by the\ntime an infection event on a newly emerged leaf causes infectious lesions, any spores\ntransferred to the leaves below will have little time to express symptoms before natural\nsenescence occurs.\nThe number of infections F(t, l) reaching the target leaf l on day t is given by\n),(),(),(\n1\n)()( ltSejtUeUltF\nM\nlj\ntkhtkh\ng\njg \uf02b\uf02b\uf03d \uf0e5\n\uf02b\uf03d\n\uf02d\uf02d (4)\nwhere Ug is the ground inoculum which is only non-zero for S. tritici, M is the\nmaximum number of diseased leaves in the model (six), hj(t) is the distance between\nleaf l and leaf j on day t, hg(t) is the distance between leaf l and the ground on day t, k is\ntransfer efficiency, and S(t,l) is a self-infection term which describes the infections a\nleaf receives from its existing infectious lesions. For all diseases except P. triticina the\nself infection term is given by\n),(),( ltUltS \uf072\uf03d (5)\nFor P. triticina the self infection term is given by\n51),( ),( \uf02d\uf03d ltUeltS (6)\nto reflect the rapid loss of leaf tissue once a leaf exhibits infectious lesions.\nS. tritici spores are dispersed throughout the canopy by rain splash (Shaw & Royal,\n1993; Shaw, 1987; Sch\u00f6fl, 1995). Hence the transfer efficiency k in Eqn 4 is a function\nof rainfall\nk r at\nbrt( ) \uf03d \uf02de (7)\nwhere a and b are parameters and rt is the amount of rain (mm) falling on day t. Daily\nrainfall and splash intensity are poorly correlated (Shaw, 1987), but splash intensity\nmeasurements are not widely available.\nCultivar resistance\nThe susceptibility of cultivars to each disease is quantified as a number from one to\nnine inclusive, nine being a resistant variety (Anon, 2003). The number is related to the\nmean percentage infection (RCR) recorded in recommended list trials. Successful\ninfections are scaled as a proportion of the infection of a rating three cultivar as shown\nin Fig. 1 (R. Bayles, National Institute of Agricultural Botany, Cambridge, pers.\ncomm.).\nTemperature\nTemperature effects on the success of infection of P. striiformis and P. triticina are\nmodelled by the normal distribution function\nR tT\nT t\n( )\n( ( ) )\n\uf03d\n\uf02d \uf02d\ne\n\uf044 \uf06d\n\uf073\n2\n22 when \uf061 \uf062\uf03c \uf03c\uf044T t( ) (8)\nelse RT(t) = 0\nwhere the thermal time (\u00b0C days) accumulated on day t is given by  \u0394T(t)=T(t)-T(t-1),\nwhere T(t) is the accumulated thermal time from sowing and \uf06d and \uf073 are disease\nspecific parameters. P. triticina has a higher optimum temperature than P. striiformis\n(De Vallavielle-Pope et al., 1995) (Fig. 2; Table 2).\nOnce a rust infection has established itself on the leaf and starts to grow, its growth\ncan be terminated by frost. In the model, if the minimum temperature on a day falls\nbelow 0\u00b0C, the growth of 10% of the infections that have occurred up until that point in\ntime is stopped.\nTemperature affects E. graminis sporulation and disease development rate. The\ntemperature effects are modelled using a cubic equation which gives an asymmetric\nrelationship\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029R T TT \uf03d \uf02d \uf02d\uf06b \uf07a \uf078\uf044 \uf0442 when \uf056 \uf078\uf0a3 \uf0a3\uf044T (9)\nRT \uf03d 0 otherwise\nwhere \uf06b , \uf078 and \uf07a are constant parameters. This model is based on the model given in\nFredrich (1995a).\nS. tritici has a wide range of temperatures over which it can develop efficiently, so\ntemperature effects in the model were restricted to the rate of lesion growth being\ndescribed in thermal time.\nRain\nFor S. tritici, the positive association between rainfall and infection is approximated\nby a linear relationship with a limit (Fig 2). The finding that transfer and infection can\noccur (by physical proximity between infectious lesions and newly emerging leaves) in\n6the absence of rainfall (Lovel et al., 2004a) is represented by the intercept. However,\nrain can reduce the infection efficiency of some pathogens such as E. graminis by\nwashing of spores. These effects are modelled by the function\n\uf028 \uf029R a br g\nd\ngrain t c rt\uf03d \uf02b\n\uf02d\n\uf02b \uf02b\uf02d\n1\n1 e ( )\uf051\n, rt <\uf031\nR\ng\nd\ngrain c rt\uf03d\n\uf02d\n\uf02b \uf02b\uf02d\n1\n1 e ( )\uf051\n, rt \uf0b3\uf031 (10)\nwhere Rrain is effect of rain on the number of infection events, a, b, c, d, g, \uf051 are\nparameters and rt is the rainfall (mm) on day t.\nThe effects of rain were considered to be insufficiently well understood to\nparameterise for P. striiformis and P. triticina. The effects of moisture on P. striiformis\ndisease risk are complex, as spores germinate poorly in free water, but require high\nrelative humidity (De Vallavielle-Pope et al., 1995).\nRelative humidity\nVery high and very low relative humidities in the crop have a negative effect on E.\ngraminis infection. This is modelled by the parabolic relationship\nR pH qH rRH \uf03d \uf02b \uf02d2 when RRH \uf0b3 0 (11)\nelse RRH = 0\nwhere RRH is the effect of relative humidity on the number of infection events, H is the\nfive day moving average of relative humidity and p, q and r are constants.\nWind speed\nWith increased wind speed, the rate of E. graminis conidia liberation increases\n(Fredrich 1995a). The relationship used is\nRwind\nW t\uf03d \uf02d \uf02d1 e \uf067 ( ) (12)\nwhere Rwind is effect of wind on the number of infection events, and W(t) is the wind run\n(km) on day t.\nLeaf age\nThe reduction in leaf susceptibility to P. striiformis with age (Rapilly, 1979) is\nmodelled by a descending sigmoidal function\nR\neage Dt\n\uf03d \uf02d\uf02b \uf02b\n1\n1\n\uf061\n\uf062 \uf061\uf067 (13)\nwhere ,\uf061 \uf062 and \uf067 are the parameters and Dt is the leaf life (\u00b0C days).\nNitrogen\nNitrogen (N) increases host susceptibility to E. graminis.

The parameters of Eqn 1 are defined by the latent period and the time taken for\nthe infection to be fully expressed. P. striiformis is recorded as having a latent period of\n162\u00b0C days (Paveley et al., 2000). The time taken for an infection event to reach\nmaximum size was assumed to be twice this value. P. triticina infections are modelled\nsimilarly. In greenhouse experiments the latent period of E. graminis lies between 55 to\n75\u00b0C days. Under field conditions it is estimated to increase by a factor of about 1.6\n(Fredrich, 1995b). Hence the latent period used here was taken to be in the mid-range of\nthe published values at 105\u00b0C days.\nFor S. tritici the literature defines the latent period as anything from 220\u00b0C days to\n440\u00b0C days (O\u2019Callaghan et al., 1994; Royle et al., 1986; Sch\u00f6fl, 1995). Sch\u00f6fl\u2019s\n(1995) glasshouse data suggest that it is approximately 220\u00b0C days and a further 55\u00b0C\ndays until the infection is fully developed. Field observations suggest the latent period\nis usually longer than this, and thus these values were scaled to 300\u00b0C days and 375\u00b0C\ndays. These are broadly comparable with values of 250 and 301 degree days (base\ntemp. \u2013 2.4\u00b0C) for first appearance of symptoms and time to 50% of maximal lesions,\npublished subsequently by Lovell et al., (2004b).\nInfection transfer and infection efficiency parameters\nWhere possible, values for the parameters were taken from the literature or fitted\nusing experiments designed to investigate only the specific relationship. The remaining\nparameters were fitted to make the model simulate the levels of disease observed in field\nexperiments. Weekly assessments of diseased area were recorded between GS 31 and\nmaturity in untreated replicated plots of four wheat cvs. (described by Milne et al., 2003\nas Data set 1). Daily weather data were collected from meteorological sites within one\nkilometre of the site. For each of the four diseases, the data from the most susceptible\ncultivar was used; Slejpner for P. striiformis, Haven and Riband for P. triticina, Apollo\nfor E. graminis and Riband for S. tritici.\nA small number of data were not used where observation or transcription errors\nresulted in illogical disease progress curves. The model was run with each weather file\nin succession, with the appropriate sowing dates, latitude, and soil nitrogen levels. The\ncanopy simulation was corrected, where necessary, so that the leaves emerged and\nsenesced at the times noted in the trial. Simulated disease levels occurring at times\ncorresponding to those observed were output from the model run. A non-linear\noptimisation scheme was used to find the parameter values that would minimise the\ndifference between simulated and observed disease levels on the top four leaves over the\nwhole data set. The code that carries out this minimisation was taken from the IMSL\nFortran library. It used a modified Levenberg-Marquart method and an active strategy\nto solve the nonlinear least squares problem (Gill et al., 1981).\nNon-linear optimisation algorithms often only find a local minimum of a complex\n8system, not the global minimum. Hence, care was taken to choose suitable initial\nconditions and parameter bounds, by ensuring that the biological interpretation of the\nfunctions was sound and investigating the effects of the parameters on the disease\nprogression.\nTo take account of sensitivity to initial inoculum, in the cases of P. striiformis, P.\ntriticina, and E. graminis, initially the data sets were sorted into high and low disease\npressure sites. The unassigned parameters, which in each case included Ys, were fitted to\nthe high disease pressure data sets, after which a second value for Ys was then calculated\nusing the low disease pressure sets.\nThe results of the parameter evaluation are shown in Table 2, where in each case the\nsource of each parameter value is indicated. Fig. 2 shows the model components plotted\nusing the parameters given in the table. Fig. 3 illustrates the disease progress curve for\nSeptoria leaf blotch plotted against some data from the experiments described above,\nshowing how the model accurately simulates the interruption in disease development\ncaused by a period of dry weather.\nObservations during the growing season\nObservations can be used to modify the simulations in two ways. Firstly, initial\ninoculum levels, or in the case of S. tritici ground inoculum, can be adjusted so that the\nsimulation reflects the user observations. A mechanism was incorporated to allow for\nthe emergence of new virulent pathotypes (for example, of P. striiformis) which cause\npreviously resistant cultivars to become susceptible. If adjusting inoculum levels fails\nto compensate sufficiently for the discrepancies between the model and simulation, the\nlevel of cultivar resistance is assumed to have fallen. In such cases the cultivar\nsusceptibility is adjusted until the simulated values of the disease fall within\npredetermined limits of the observation.\nDiseases can be assessed as more serious than they actually are, or underestimated, or\nthe foci of disease can be missed despite being present (Parker et al. 1995). Hence,\nobservation handling procedures were developed that incorporate a prior knowledge of\ndisease risk with the observation.\nAdjusting inoculum levels for biotroph models\nThe inoculum levels are estimated by taking into account previous levels of disease at\na site, and observations of disease in the current season. For E. graminis, P. striiformis\nand P. triticina this was done using Bayes\u2019 theorem (DeGroot, 1989).\nA site is defined as being at very high (VH), high (H), medium (M), or low (L) risk of\ndisease, which reflects the number of previous years with very high, high and medium\nlevels of disease. The user chooses the site type based on a set of definitions. A\nspecific year will have an unknown VH, H, M, or L level of disease. Thus, a site that is\nconsidered to be at medium risk can, for example, have a very high disease year. The\nprobability of a level of observation for each type of year can be determined from\nexperimental data. Thus using Bayes\u2019 theorem, the probability that a year is a certain\ntype given a disease observation can be calculated. In terms of this application, Bayes\u2019\ntheorem states\nProb(Year|Obs)=Prob(Obs|Year) Prob(Year)\/Prob(Obs), (16)\nwhere | means \u201cgiven\u201d. The observation (Obs) is also classified as being a VH, H, M\nor L type but may be an incorrect estimate of the specific year.\n9Using expert opinion and data from the trials described above, the prior probabilities\nof the year types occurring at given site types were derived. The values for P.\nstriiformis are shown in Table 3. The probabilities of an observation occurring in the\ndifferent year types were determined. It is more likely not to observe disease when it\ndoes exist than to observe it when it doesn\u2019t exist. For P. striiformis, these values are\nshown in Table 4. Each type of year has an associated initial inoculum level. Using\nweather from the current year, the model simulates the expected observation for each\nyear type. Using this information, the actual observation is classified as being a VH, H,\nM or L type and thus modifies the prior probabilities of the type of disease year.\nThe information needed to calculate the probability of a certain year type occurring\ngiven a particular observation can be found in the Tables 3 and 4. For example, at a VH\nsite, given a VH observation, the probability of the year being high risk is given by\nProb(VHyear|VHObs) = Prob(VHObs|VHyear) Prob(VHYear) \/ Prob(VHObs) (17)\nIn the P. striiformis example, the probability of a VH observation given a VH year is\n0.4. The probability of a VH year at this very high site is 0.8. The probability of a VH\nobservation is given by the sum of the probability of a VH observation at a given year\ntype (Table 4) multiplied by the probability of the given year type at the VH site (Table\n3), which in this example is 0.34. Therefore the Prob(VHyear|VHObs) = 0.941. Similar\ncalculations show that this very high observation revises the probability of VH, H, M, L\nyear types from (0.8, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0) to (0.941, 0.059, 0.0, 0.0).\nFor P. striiformis, P. triticina and E. graminis the levels of risk are incorporated into\nthe model by the inoculum parameter Is=b\u00d710-a, where b is a constant parameter and a is\nassigned a value depending on disease risk. In the case of P. striiformis b = 5 and the\nexponent a is set to 2.0, 3.0, 4.4, 6.5 for VH, H, M, L respectively. The probabilities of\neach of the levels of risk occurring are applied to the exponent values to give a new\nvalue based on user observation and site type. In the example described above, the new\nexponent value is given by 2.0\u00d70.941+3.0\u00d70.059=2.059. If no observation had been\nmade the exponent would be 2.0\u00d70.8+3.0\u00d70.2=2.2, which would give slightly lower\nlevels of disease. The list of possible new values for the exponent is given in Table 5\nAdjusting ground disease levels for S. tritici model\nThe model considers disease progress from leaf six onward and any previous climatic\neffects on disease (Gladders et al., 2001) are only accounted for through subsequent\ndisease observations. Disease levels can be quite varied early in the season, so a facility\nto adjust ground disease was needed. The methodology was similar to the one used for\nthe other diseases. However, the effects of observations of disease at low severities\nwere reduced to avoid very small changes in observations resulting in excessive effects\non predictions. The year can be very high (VH), high (H), medium (M), low (L), or very\nlow (VL) (initially the default is the mid-point, as no initial perception of site type is\navailable). The beta distribution was used to calculate the probability of being in a\nparticular year type, given an observation, as it gives the desired behaviour. The beta\ndistribution was defined as ),:( bay\uf062 , where 0.0 < y \uf0a3 0.2 for VL, 0.2 < y \uf0a3 0.4 for L,\n0.4 < y \uf0a3 0.6 for M, 0.6 < y \uf0a3 0.8 for H, 0.8 < y \uf0a3 1.0 for VH. The parameters are\ndefined as a = 1 + (observed disease)\/7.0 and b = 1 + (simulated disease with moderate\ninoculum)\/7.0. Fig. 4 shows the distribution with four different combinations of\nobserved and simulated disease level.\nThe ground inoculum was of the form Ug =3.25\u00d710a, where the exponent a is the\nparameter adjusted by disease observations. The values of a for VL, L, M, H, VH are -\n10\n1, 0, 1, 2, 3 respectively. If an observation was made, then the value of the parameter a\nwas altered to the probability weighted average:\na = -Prob(VL\/Obs) + Prob (M\/Obs) +2 Prob (H\/Obs) + 3 Prob (VH\/Obs) (18)\nModel Validation\nMaterials and methods\nIn the 1999\/2000 season, randomised and replicated field plots of winter wheat were\nestablished at eight sites across the UK, selected to represent a wide range of\nenvironments and disease pressure. Two cvs were grown at Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire\n(cvs Abbot and Claire), High Mowthorpe, North Yorkshire (Abbot and Consort),\nMorley, Norfolk (Abbot and Consort), Rosemaund, Herefordshire (Abbot and Consort),\nand Starcross, Devon (Abbot and Buster), three at Terrington, Norfolk (Abbot, Brigadier\nand Harrier), and one each at Limavady, N. Ireland (Abbot) and Moira, N. Ireland\n(Consort). Plots received no fungicide treatments. Nitrogen fertilizer was managed to\nachieve a canopy size of approximately GAI six. Leaf emergence dates and percentage\ndisease were recorded weekly for each leaf layer that had emerged (ligule visible), on\nten randomly sampled shoots from each of the three replicate plots of each cultivar.\nThe disease simulation was run for each site using weather data collected from that\nsite, along with information on sowing date and longitude.\nResults\nTables 6a and 6b compare simulated and observed disease severity on the top two\nleaves. The last four weekly observations on each leaf were used. The first number in\neach category set shows the number of simulation\/observation sets that fall in the\ncategory without using a disease observation, and the number in brackets is the amount\nafter a single disease observation correction around GS37 was used. Where possible the\nfirst observation of disease on leaf 4 was used. In cases where this was not available an\nobservation on a higher leaf was used. Categories of disease severity were chosen to\nreflect the non-linear relationship between disease and the appropriate fungicide dose.\nSeverities above 20% were not subdivided, as such large values usually lead to a dose\nclose to, or at, the maximum being applied. Simulated and observed disease severities\nfor P. triticinia and E. graminis all fell in the lowest two categories, so figures have not\nbeen produced. The S. tritici tables show comparisons of the disease growing on the cvs\nAbbot, Consort, Claire, Buster, Brigadier and Harrier. The P. striiformis tables show\ncomparisons of the disease growing on the cvs Abbot, Brigadier and Harrier. In these\nsimulations P. striiformis inoculum was set to \u2018High\u2019 for sites on the east coast, which\nin the past had severe cases of P. striiformis, and \u2018Low\u2019 for others.\nThe results of the simulation showed that the model responded correctly, across the\neight contrasting validation sites, to a different season and different varieties than those\nused for parameter estimation. For S. tritici, simulated severity values were within one\ncategory of the observed values for 88% and 81% of cases, with and without an update\nto the simulation, respectively (Table 6a). The equivalent values for yellow rust were\n91% and 85% (Table 6b). For both diseases, in the relatively small number of cases\nwhere prediction was imprecise, predicted severities were greater than observed.\nDiscussion\n11\nThe model provided predictions of the development of the four foliar diseases on each\nof the upper culm leaves of wheat that are most important in determining the impact of\ndisease on grain yield. Here, we consider the extent to which each of the model\nrequirements, described in the introduction, were met.\nThe model has been implemented as part of a decision support system (Parsons et al.,\n2004), by coupling with canopy (Milne et al., 2003), fungicide application, yield loss\nand decision models (Parsons & Te Beest, 2004). Hence, the run time has been\nquantified in practice. Selecting a list of appropriate fungicide programmes (fungicide\nproducts, dose and timings within the next four week period), ranked by margin over\ntreatment cost, typically takes 20 seconds using an 1.8 Ghz computer. During this\noptimization process, the process model is run approximately 2000 times.\nThe requirement for simplicity constrained the number of risk variables that were\naccounted for with each disease. It is not feasible to quantify the relative importance of\na wide range of risk variables simultaneously in an experiment. Hence, the choice of\nwhich variables to include or exclude is somewhat subjective, although analysis of\nsurvey data can provide a guide (Gladder et al., 2001) and validation can provide a\nmeasure of the resulting predictive value. With a single disease observation in mid-\nseason to update the simulation, predicted disease severity values were acceptably close\nto observed values in approximately 90% of cases. In the remaining cases, disease was\nover-predicted. Such errors are of less concern than erroneous false negatives, as they\nare risk-averse.\nThe models for the four diseases were considered as competing for the same green\nlamina area. However, the level of disease control required in commercial practice\nmeans that all diseases are constrained to low severities and competition for green area\nis of less consequence than for untreated crops. As there might be a small competitive\nadvantage to the disease which is called first, in each time step of the algorithm, the\neffect of changing the order was tested and was found to be trivial. However, it was\nfound that if the simulation was run with a cultivar that was susceptible to both P.\nstriiformis and S. tritici at a site designated as high or very high risk to P. striiformis,\nthen (in the absence of fungicide treatment or user observations) levels of P. striiformis\non the lower leaves were lower than observed in the data and the levels of S. tritici were\nhigher. This phenomenon decreased up the canopy until on the flag leaf, simulated\ndisease severity agreed with that observed. The latent period for P. striiformis is shorter\nthan that for S. tritici, hence the former can out-compete the latter. But in the model the\nS. tritici ground inoculum put P. striiformis at an initial competitive disadvantage.\nAlthough these effects were not particularly important once fungicide applications were\nmade, they were affecting the predictions of disease-induced yield loss. To overcome\nthis, the S. tritici ground inoculum was reduced when the cultivar is susceptible to P.\nstriiformis (cultivar resistance <4) and the site is designated as high or very high risk to\nP. striiformis.\nMechanisms were implemented to allow observations of disease to be used to update\nthe predictions of disease progress during the growing season. A single observation at a\nkey growth stage for fungicide treatments (flag leaf emergence) was sufficient to\nimprove the prediction of severity on the upper leaves during grain filling. Without\nobservations, predictions were risk averse. In practice, two or three observations at key\ngrowth stages would not make excessive time demands of users.\nAcknowledgements\n12\nFunding from Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs and the Home-\nGrown Cereals Authority is gratefully acknowledged.
