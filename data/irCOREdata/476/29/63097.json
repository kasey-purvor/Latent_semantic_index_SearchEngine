Such soil performs a range of functions; modulating flow \nto groundwater, filtering contaminants, a resource for recreation (parks), and \ndomestic-scale food production in gardens and allotments.  They also act as a store of \norganic carbon (OC), which is of considerable interest given its role in the global \ncarbon cycle, and at national scales for the estimation of soil-related carbon-dioxide \nemissions as part of commitments to the UNFCC (United Framework Convention on \nClimate Change).  In the UK and elsewhere, attention has typically focussed on rural, \nas opposed to urban soil, as the former accounts for the vast majority of soil organic \ncarbon (SOC) content; (Bradley et al., 2005).  However, urban development currently \nrepresents a substantial 14% of land use in the UK (DEFRA, 2004), and this \nproportion will increase over the next decade following proposed expansion of \nhousing, particularly in south-east England (Office of the Deputy Prime Minisiter, \n2003).\nAlthough several EU member states have established some form of monitoring \nsystem for detecting changes in SOC in soil, these do not currently include urban soils \n(Working Group on Monitoring: Task Group on Existing soil monitoring systems, \n2004), a weakness also identified in a recent report concerning current soil monitoring \nschemes in the UK (SNIFFER, 2006).  We believe greater scrutiny of available data \nwhich could be used as a basis for evaluating organic matter status and estimating \nSOC stocks in urban areas is warranted.\nPage 3 of 38\nSoil Use and Management\nSoil Use and Management\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nSoil organic carbon in UK urban areas  4\nThe total organic carbon (TOC) content of urban soil typically comprises two \ndominant components; labile carbon of which the vast majority has turnover rates of a \nfew years (Parton et al., 1987) and more recalcitrant black carbon (BC), with turnover \ntimes of up to hundreds or thousands of years (Preston, 2006), representing a potential \nlong term carbon sink.  However, a recent study has suggested short residence times \nfor significant proportions (27-39%) of BC in soil where carbon added as char was \nrecovered from the soil mineral phase in a six month incubation experiment (Hilscher \n& Knicker, 2007).  In this paper we use the term BC to refer to that fraction of SOC \nwhich remains following the application of the chemothermal oxidation (CTO) \nprocedure described by Kuhlbusch (1995).  A large proportion of this BC will have \nresidence times greater than a few hundred years.  We refer to the shorter residence \ntime SOC fraction which is removed during application of the CTO procedure as \n\u2018labile\u2019 carbon.\nBlack carbon is formed by the incomplete combustion of plant material and \nfossil fuels, and can account for up to 70% of the OC in urban soil samples (Lorenz et \nal., 2006).  To understand changes in the state of urban soils and establish effective \npolicies for their management, policymakers need accurate measurements of SOC \nthrough time which are not biased by contributions from BC.  Without such data, \nchanges in soil organic matter status, which supports many soil functions, may not be \nrecognised.  \nFor the purpose of estimating UK SOC stocks, Bradley et al. (2005) assumed \nthat built over (urban) soils had zero SOC, and that suburban soils had half the OC\ncontent of the equivalent soil series under pasture.  We found three studies comparing \nurban and rural SOC contents; for forest stands along an urban-rural gradient in New \nYork (Pouyat et al., 2002), five cities in the USA (Pouyat et al., 2006), and another \nPage 4 of 38\nSoil Use and Management\nSoil Use and Management\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nSoil organic carbon in UK urban areas  5\naround Stuttgart in Germany (Stahr et al., 2003).  In recent years, the British \nGeological Survey has undertaken a series of soil surveys across twenty urban \nenvironments in the UK, with the primary objective of establishing spatial variation in \nsoil geochemistry (Rawlins et al., 2005).  For seven of these surveys, comprising \naround 4000 individual sampling locations, estimates are available for topsoil (0-15 \ncm depth) SOC based on LOI (loss on ignition) analysis at 450 \u00b0 C.\nSoil organic carbon content is estimated from LOI analyses on the assumption \nthat carbon accounts for around 58% of the mass reduction following the complete \nremoval of organic matter (Broadbent, 1953).  In recent years, the use of LOI as a \nmeans of estimating SOC has become less common, largely due to the potential for its \noverestimation due to the presence of structural water in clay and oxyhydroxides.  For \nexample, in heavily textured soil, loss of structural water from clay can account for 4-\n6% of total weight loss, which if not identified as such would represent an extra 2-3% \nOC (De Leenheer et al., 1957). One potential advantage of an LOI analysis is that a \nsignificant component of BC will not be oxidised at temperatures of 450 \u00b0 C. When \napplied to samples with large proportions of BC, an LOI analysis will provide a closer \napproximation to labile SOC content than TOC analyses based on combustion at 1050\n\u00b0 C in which any BC is included.  By establishing whether a consistent proportion of \nBC is oxidised by LOI analysis, it may be possible to provide a cost-effective \napproximation of the BC content of a soil sample based on the difference between \nLOI and TOC analyses applied sequentially to the same sample.  This might be of \npractical use in situations where loss in the accuracy of estimates of BC is outweighed \nby the lower overall laboratory cost.\nThe aim of this paper is to investigate and apply statistical relationships between \ndifferent methods for the estimation of SOC in urban soils, which can be complicated \nPage 5 of 38\nSoil Use and Management\nSoil Use and Management\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nSoil organic carbon in UK urban areas  6\ndue to the presence of significant quantities of BC.  To do this, we selected a subset of \n10 topsoil samples (0 to 15 cm depth) from each of three urban centres and estimated \ntheir labile SOC content as the difference between their TOC and BC contents.  We \ninvestigated the statistical relationship between this labile SOC and the estimates of \nSOC based on the original LOI analyses.  If a statistical relationship could be \nestablished, it may then be possible to estimate labile SOC in all the original survey \nsamples.  The benefits of such an approach include a firmer basis for the estimation of \nSOC stocks in UK urban areas, and the establishment of a baseline which could be \nused for monitoring change.  In combination with data for rural areas, we also tested \nwhether the assumption proposed by Bradley et al., (2005) for estimating urban SOC \nbased on local rural soils under pasture is supported based on empirical data. Finally, \nwe investigated whether combining sequential LOI and TOC analyses could provide a \ncost-effective method for the estimating the BC content of a soil sample.\nMethods\nUrban centres, soil survey and sample selection\nWe chose to select a subset of soil samples for detailed analysis based on archived \nmaterial from the urban surveys of Coventry, Stoke-on-Trent and Glasgow (Table 1 \nand Figure 1).  Here we summarise the soil survey methodology in each urban centre.  \nEach of the urban areas was defined approximately by the area within a boundary of \ncontinuous urban development, and was sampled at a resolution of 4 samples per \nsquare kilometre.  Sample sites were selected from open ground as close as possible \nto the centre of each of four 500-metre squares, within each kilometre square of the \nBritish National Grid (BNG).  Typical locations for sampling were gardens, parks, \nrecreational fields, road verges, schoolyards and various types of made ground.

In the case of Stoke-on-Trent, the support was a square \nof side length two metres, with nine samples combined from the corners, the centre \nand the centres of each side.  The locations of sampling sites in Stoke-on-Trent were \nrecorded using 1:10 000 scale Ordnance Survey maps, whilst handheld GPS systems \nwere used in Glasgow and Coventry.  A description of any visible contamination (e.g. \nindustrial waste, pottery, bricks, plastics etc.), soil clast lithologies (e.g. sandstone, \nlimestone, etc.), and basic land use information was also recorded for each site.\nOn return to the laboratory the samples were air-dried at 40 \u00b0 C, and plant roots \nwere removed during sieving through a 2 mm; the fraction passing through the sieve \nwas retained for analysis.  Loss on ignition was estimated for each sample by heating \nto 450 \u00b0 C for eight hours, and TOC estimated by multiplying the mass difference by \n0.58 (Broadbent, 1953).  The coefficient of variation for this method for 174 replicate \nanalyses of a sample standard was 3.6%. The summary statistics presented in Table 2 \nshow that the statistical distributions of SOC estimated from LOI analyses for the \nthree urban centres are quite different; median values range from 3.3% (Coventry), to \n6.8% (Stoke-on-Trent); Glasgow had an intermediate median value of 5.2%.  These \ndifferences are likely to reflect a combination of the inherited properties of the soil \nand varying land management in the three urban centres.\nWe considered whether it would be possible to use the available land use \ninformation to stratify the sites by some measure of cultivation, but we did not \nPage 7 of 38\nSoil Use and Management\nSoil Use and Management\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nSoil organic carbon in UK urban areas  8\nconsider it to be sufficiently detailed to do so.  To encompass the variation in OC\nusing a subset of the urban samples, we randomly selected one archived soil sample \nfrom each decile of the SOC distribution (based on the LOI analyses) for each of \nthese three urban centres \u2013 thirty samples in total.  For each of the samples we \nestimated the concentration of TOC, TIC (total inorganic carbon) and BC using the \nmethods described below.  We also estimated the TOC content of the residue from \neach sample following application of the LOI procedure. A summary of the analytical \ntechniques is provided in Table 3. Finally, for any samples where there was a large \ndiscrepancy between SOC estimated by the LOI and TOC analyses, we analysed its \nclay mineral composition by XRD (X-ray diffraction).\nSelection of procedure for determination of Black carbon.\nA variety of analytical methods have been developed to quantify BC in soils and \nsediments, including thermal, chemical and optical determination as well as other \nindirect methods (Schmidt & Noack, 2000). The primary objective of these \nprocedures is to distinguish thermally modified carbon (BC) from unaltered \nbiopolymers and their geological counterparts, as well as inorganic carbonate C.  \nComparative analysis of eight Australian soils by six established methods revealed \nnon-systematic variations by factors of between 14 and 571 (more than two orders of \nmagnitude) for an individual sample (Schmidt et al., 2001). The large differences in \nBC concentrations from an individual sample were attributed to the variable abilities \nof each method to remove non-BC due in part to the different forms of natural organic \nmatter. Thus each method had a differing analytical window depending on which pre-\ntreatment, oxidation and determination technique was applied (Schmidt et al., 2001).\nPage 8 of 38\nSoil Use and Management\nSoil Use and Management\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nSoil organic carbon in UK urban areas  9\nCurrently there are no standardised procedures for BC determination.  The CTO \nmethod yields more conservative estimates of BC when compared to: i) chemical \noxidation by treatment with high energy UV-13C NMR or, ii) chemical oxidation \nusing HNO3 and quantification of derivatized benzocarboxylic acids (BCA) using gas \nchromatography (GC) and combined GC-mass spectrometry (GC\/MS; see Schmidt et \nal. (2001).  Two advantages of the CTO method are that the chemical pre-treatment \nstage minimizes charring of non-BC components and its former application to urban \nsoils, sediments and residues from vegetation fires, so the results can be compared \nwith other studies (Kuhlbusch, 1995; Gustafsson et al., 1997; Reddy et al., 2002; \nLorenz et al., 2006).  The main uncertainties of the CTO procedure for BC \nquantification include possible oxidation of BC and loss of small particles of BC \nduring the centrifugation\/decantation stage (Kuhlbusch, 1995). Nevertheless, these \nuncertainties are no greater, and in many instances less, than those of other BC \nmethods (Schmidt & Noack, 2000; Nguyen et al., 2004). We therefore selected a \nmodified CTO method to quantify BC in our urban soil samples.\nAnalytical methods\nThe method used in this study to determine BC was based on that described by \nKuhlbusch (1995). In summary, soils were extracted with aqueous solvents to remove \nas much inorganic carbon (IC) and OC as possible.  The samples were then thermally \ntreated in order to remove the remaining inorganic and organic C. The BC content of \neach sample was directly quantified after these two steps by TOC analysis of carbon \nat 1050 \u00b0 C (after removal of inorganic carbon).\nPage 9 of 38\nSoil Use and Management\nSoil Use and Management\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nSoil organic carbon in UK urban areas  10\nSample preparation.

Total carbon (TC) was estimated using the same \nmethod but without acidification. Total inorganic carbon (TIC) was calculated by \ndifference (i.e. TC-TOC=TIC). Procedural blanks were below instrumental response \nthreshold. The limit of quantification for TOC for a typical 300 mg sample was \n0.18%.\nWet extraction. For each soil a 2 g sub-sample was placed in a glass centrifuge tube \nand treated with 25 mL of solvents in the order: 2 \u00d7 NaOH (1 M), l \u00d7 70 mass % \nHNO3, 6 \u00d7 1 M NaOH, 1 \u00d7 1 mass % HCl, and 2 \u00d7 18 M\u03a9 distilled, deionised water. \nAfter addition of each solvent the sample was sonicated in a heated ultrasonic bath \n(Camlab, 300W) for 15 min at 40\u00b0C, then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min (Fisher \nScientific, acuuSpin 3) and the supernatant decanted and discarded.

This was undertaken using a PANalytical X\u2019Pert Pro series \ndiffractometer equipped with a cobalt-target tube, X\u2019Celerator detector and operated \nat 45kV and 40mA. The micronised sample was scanned from 4.5-85\u00b02\u03b8 at \n2.76\u00b02\u03b8\/minute.  Diffraction data were initially analysed using 2004 PANalytical \nX\u2019Pert Highscore Plus software coupled to the latest version of the International \nCentre for Diffraction Data (ICDD) database.  Following identification of the mineral \nspecies present in the sample, mineral quantification was achieved using the Rietveld \nrefinement technique (Snyder & Bish, 1989) using PANalytical Highscore Plus \nsoftware.  This method avoids the need to produce synthetic mixtures and involves the \nleast squares fitting of measured to calculated XRD profiles using a crystal structure \ndatabank.  Errors for the quoted mineral concentrations are typically \u00b12.5% for \nconcentrations >60 wt%, \u00b15% for concentrations between 60 and 30 wt%, \u00b110% for \nconcentrations between 30 and 10 wt%, \u00b120% for concentrations between 10 and 3 \nwt% and \u00b140% for concentrations <3 wt% (Hillier et al., 2001).\nResults and statistical analysis\nTypes of soil carbon\nThe analytical data from the analysis of the thirty samples for the different types of \nsoil carbon are shown in Table 4, in addition to the land use information recorded at \nthese sites.  With relatively few sites we have not attempted to make any inferences \nregarding the significance of land use, although there does not appear to be a strong \nbias towards a particular land use class in any of the urban centres.  Total inorganic \ncarbon generally accounts for a small fraction of TC, with a mean of 3.9% and \nminimum and maximum of 0.12 and 12% of TC, respectively.\nPage 11 of 38\nSoil Use and Management\nSoil Use and Management\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nSoil organic carbon in UK urban areas  12\nMedian BC concentrations were 0.46%, 0.59% and 1.77% for Coventry, Stoke-\non-Trent and Glasgow, respectively. We also calculated the proportion of BC relative \nto TOC in each sample; the median of these proportions for samples in Stoke-on-\nTrent (12.4%) is similar to that for Coventry (16.4 %), whilst that for Glasgow is \nsignificantly larger (32.8 %).  A sample from Glasgow also had the highest proportion \n(61 %) of BC to TOC, which is approaching the 73 % value reported by Lorenz et al. \n(2006) using a CTO method.  The soil parent materials for Stoke-on-Trent and \nGlasgow comprise similar Carboniferous lithologies which suggests that \nanthropogenic sources may account for the larger amounts, and proportions of BC to \nTOC, in Glasgow.  It is known that coal ash was widely dispersed across urban \nGlasgow as a soil conditioner (Pers Comm., Paul Mellon \u2013 Glasgow City Council).\nOrganic carbon in soil residues after LOI analysis\nThe relationship between the quantity of OC in soil residue after application of the \nLOI procedure and the BC content of the original soil is shown in Figure 2.  For this \nsubset of samples, their BC content is a linearly related to the quantity of TOC \nremaining in the soil after LOI analysis at 450 \u00b0 C.  As neither of these variates had a \nstrongly skewed distribution, we calculated a linear regression equation by the method \nof least squares using the original data. The equation is of the form,\n\u03b5\u03b2\u03b1 ++= xy (1)\nin which residual TOC after analysis was the explanatory variable ( x ), with which we \nwish to predict the BC content of the original sample ( y ), with \u03b5  representing any \nunexplained variation.  The coefficients for the regression equations are shown in \nPage 12 of 38\nSoil Use and Management\nSoil Use and Management\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nSoil organic carbon in UK urban areas  13\nTable 5a and the regression line is shown in Figure 2.  The residuals from the \nregression were approximately normally distributed.  The regression equation \ncaptures 97% of the variance representing a very strong linear relationship for these \nsamples based on these two methods.  The position of the regression line shows that \nthe LOI analysis removes a small, but consistent proportion of BC from each urban \nsoil sample.  The small residual standard error of 0.23% suggests this relationship \nmay be useful for prediction.  Such a relationship could be of practical use; the \nprocedure for BC analysis is considerably more costly and complex than estimating \nits concentration based on a combination of LOI followed by TOC analysis.\nPrediction of labile SOC using LOI values\nWe explored the relationship between labile SOC, that is TOC minus BC, versus SOC \nestimated by the LOI procedure for which we have analyses for all the urban soil \nsamples.  Neither of these variates was strongly skewed so we pursued our analysis \nusing the original, untransformed data which ar  plotted in Figure 3.  There is a clear \nlinear relationship, with the exception of one sample, denoted A.  For this sample, the \nLOI analysis appeared to significantly overestimate the SOC content.  Hence, we \nestimated the proportions of the different soil minerals in this sample by XRD (X-ray \ndiffraction).\nUsing the Rietveld refinement technique, we estimated that the mineral kaolinite \naccounted for around 23.6% of the soil mineral component (see Figure 4).  It has been \nreported that the structural water in kaolinite can account for between 13 and 20% of \nweight loss at 850 \u00b0 C (Grim, 1953).  In our sample above, therefore, loss of structural \nwater could account for between 3.1 and 4.7% of the reported organic matter content \n(estimated by mass difference), and multiplying by 0.58 to account for the OC\nPage 13 of 38\nSoil Use and Management\nSoil Use and Management\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nSoil organic carbon in UK urban areas  14\nfraction, between 1.8 and 2.8% of the estimated SOC.  This sample was collected in \nStoke-on-Trent which has a long history of ceramics production, waste from which \ncould account for large quantities of kaolinite in the soil. We believe this may account \nfor the overestimation of SOC using LOI and so we felt justified in excluding this \nsample from the next stage of our statistical analysis.\nWe wished to assess whether a single linear regression relationship could be \nused to estimate labile SOC based on estimates from LOI analyses for the different \nurban centres.  To do this we tested for evidence of non-parallel slopes for each of the \nthree cities between labile SOC (TOC minus BC) and SOC estimated by LOI.  We \nundertook a two-factor ANOVA with LOI as a covariate in which city was an \ninteraction term (Table 6a).  We also tested for evidence of a quadratic term in the \nlinear regression model (Table 6b).  In both cases the statistical significance for each \nwas weak; P values of 0.32 and 0.14, respectively. We proceeded by calculating a \nlinear regression (equation 1) using the method of least squares based on the original \ndata with the kaolinite-enriched sample excluded.  In this case, SOC based on LOI \nanalysis was the explanatory variable ( x ), with which we wish to predict the labile \nSOC (TOC-BC) content of the original sample ( y ), with \u03b5  representing any \nunexplained variation.  The coefficients for the regression equations are shown in \nTable 5b and the regression line in Figure 3.  The residuals from the regression were \napproximately normally distributed and the model accounted for 81% of the variance, \nsuggesting it could also be useful basis for prediction.  It is important to note that we \nwould not expect a 1:1 relationship between the estimates of SOC based on LOI and \nthe labile SOC (TOC minus BC) because a proportion of BC in each of the samples is \nnot included in the former.  We used the regression equation to predict labile SOC \nusing the LOI data multiplied by 0.58 for all the soil samples from each of the three \nPage 14 of 38\nSoil Use and Management\nSoil Use and Management\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nSoil organic carbon in UK urban areas  15\ncities, and plotted them as empirical cumulative distributions (Figure 5).  We also \nplotted symbols to show the position of the median SOC estimates based on the \noriginal LOI analyses.  For each urban area the median predicted labile SOC is \nsignificantly less than the median estimates of SOC, for which there are two main \nreasons.  First, the LOI analysis includes a fraction of the BC which is removed from \nthe estimate of labile SOC by applying the regression equation. Second, it is likely \nthat the LOI analyses will slightly overestimate SOC due to the liberation of small \nquantities of structural water from clay minerals, and this will be corrected in the \nregression equation based on the TOC analyses.  The estimates of labile SOC could \nbe used as a basis for mapping, or with assumptions for bulk density, the estimation of \nOC stocks in these urban areas.\nComparison of labile urban SOC and rural SOC.\nWe compared the mean labile SOC (TOC minus BC) values for each of the three \nurban centres with half the mean SOC for the equivalent local Soil Associations in \nEngland and Scotland under pasture (Figure 1) according to the method adopted by \nBradley et al. (2005).  For the soils around Coventry and Stoke-on-Trent the sampling \ndepths for the rural samples were consistent with those in the urban environment (0 to \n15 cm depth).  For samples around Stoke-on-Trent, we removed from the calculation \nthose from the Wilcocks series as this outlier (SOC 24.8%) would have seriously \nbiased an estimate of the mean (Figure 1). The rural samples around Glasgow, \nsupplied by the Macaulay Institute, are horizon specific.  As information was not \navailable on stratification, the closest possible comparison was to use data for samples \nfrom a soil depth range of 5 to 15 cm.\nPage 15 of 38\nSoil Use and Management\nSoil Use and Management\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nSoil organic carbon in UK urban areas  16\nThe mean labile SOC content (TOC minus BC) of urban samples from Coventry \nwas 3.1%, compared with a value of 2.0% for half the mean content under local \npasture.  In Glasgow, mean labile SOC is 3.7%, compared to 2.9% which is half of \nthe mean under pasture from the local Rowanhill association.  Finally, mean labile \nSOC in Stoke was 4.6%, whilst half the mean content in local pasture is 1.9%.  In \neach case, taking the value of half the mean from local pasture underestimates the \nmean labile SOC of the ten urban samples.  For Coventry and Glasgow the \ndifferences are 1.1 and 0.8 % respectively, whilst the 2.7% difference for Stoke is \nconsiderably larger.\nDiscussion\nOur findings showed that the assumption used by Bradley et al. (2005) for estimation \nof carbon stocks in suburban areas of the UK would underestimate, to varying \ndegrees, labile SOC content and hence carbon stocks.  We would need to test the \nregression relationship we established for predicting labile SOC using data from other \ncentres before it could be applied more widely.  If this relationship proved to be \nrobust, then it could be a cost-effective method for estimating labile SOC using a \nlimited number of soil samples from large urban centres.  Although SOC was the\nfocus of this study, it is also important to consider the potentially significant \ncontributions from IC to soil carbon stocks.\nMore knowledge of the variation in quantity and type of SOC across the entire \ndepth range of differing urban soil materials would significantly improve our \nestimates of urban carbon stocks.  For example, archived soil material is available \nfrom the original urban surveys for depths of between 35 and 50 cm, although no \ninformation is available on total soil depths at these sites.  Another potential limitation \nPage 16 of 38\nSoil Use and Management\nSoil Use and Management\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nSoil organic carbon in UK urban areas  17\non our understanding of urban soil carbon distributions is a detailed knowledge of \nchanges in land use history.  The interpretation of its influence and that of local \npollution sources was not an aim of this study.  Such an approach based on relatively \nfew samples may be problematic due the large number of carbon sources that may be \nintroduced as unrecorded applications of soil material or fill, reflecting the dynamic \nand complex history of urban soils in the UK.  Despite such concerns, a recent case \nstudy in Nanjing (China) has shown significant differences in BC contents in areas of \ndiffering land use, such as roadsides, parks and residential areas (He & Zhang, 2007).  \nThe major environmental problems caused by atmospheric emissions of BC \nparticles such as smog formation and local air pollution are not necessarily mirrored \nin the subsurface.  One beneficial effect of BC in soils is their ability to bind \npersistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons \n(PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenylethers \n(PBDEs) (Gustafsson et al., 1997; Bucheli & Gustafsson, 2003). Combined, \nconceptual models, field-data and column experiments suggest that adsorption of \nPOPs to BC surfaces can reduce uptake in organisms by up to two orders of \nmagnitude (Koelmans et al., 2006).  Soils with elevated BC contents, such as the \nurban soils analysed here, may effectively bind POPs and decrease the bioavailable \nconcentrations of these toxic compounds.  \nTotal organic carbon analysis of soil residue following application of the LOI \nprocedure showed that a small, but consistent proportion of the BC is removed at 450 \n\u00b0 C.  This suggests that the LOI procedure is differentiating between two forms of BC, \none which is oxidised below 450 \u00ba C, and a more recalcitrant form which combusts at \nhigher temperatures.  More research is required to determine whether TOC analysis of \nthe soil residue following LOI could be a practical, cost-effective method for \nPage 17 of 38\nSoil Use and Management\nSoil Use and Management\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nSoil organic carbon in UK urban areas  18\nestimating BC contents of soil.  By reducing the temperature in the LOI procedure to \nbetween 350 and 380 \u00ba C, it may be possible to avoid part of the BC oxidation from \nthis part of the analysis.  This approach would need to be tested on different \ncombinations and types of black and labile carbon before it could be applied more \nwidely. Such inexpensive methods for estimating BC contents in soil may be required \nif carbon sequestration resulting from the application of char is widely adopted as a \nmechanism to ameliorate rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations (Lehmann, 2006).  \nUrban soils may also provide man-made observatories for research investigating the \npotential side-effects of black carbon sequestration (Fowles, 2007).\nWe suggested that the significantly higher mean BC contents of soils in \nGlasgow, by comparison to those in Coventry and Stoke-on-Trent, were attributable \nto greater historical BC dispersal across the former.  By analysing the BC content of \nlocal rural soils developed over the same parent material types, we should be able to \ndetermine whether geogenic sources of BC could account for the observed \ndifferences.  It may also be of interest to establish whether the beneficial effects of \nchar on soil fertility (Steiner et al., 2007) could be established for these BC enriched \nurban soils of Glasgow in relation to their rural equivalents.\nTo our knowledge, the survey data published in this paper are the first to \nestablish a baseline which could be used for subsequent monitoring of change in OC\ncontents of UK urban soil and assessing changes in the functions they can perform.\nThe dynamic nature of urban environments will present particular challenges to soil \nmonitoring for the assessment of changes in soil function.  Detailed information will \nbe required on any local addition or removal of soil material or fill which could lead \nto abrupt changes in SOC contents and other indicators of soil quality.\nPage 18 of 38\nSoil Use and Management\nSoil Use and Management\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nSoil organic carbon in UK urban areas  19\nConclusion\nThe main findings of our study are:\n1. By subtracting estimates of BC from TOC for a subset of thirty urban soil samples \n\u2013 ten from each of three urban areas \u2013 we estimated their labile SOC contents.  \nWe demonstrated a strong linear relationship between this estimate of labile SOC \nand the original LOI estimates of SOC.  In addition, there was insufficient \nevidence for the application of differing slopes in the regression relationships for \nthe tree urban areas, so we applied the same equation to all the LOI data from the \noriginal surveys to provide improved estimates of labile SOC.  This relationship \nneeds to be tested further before it could be applied more widely.\n2. We showed that an assumption for estimating the SOC content of urban soils, \nbased on half the mean value under pasture for local soil associations is likely to \nunderestimate their content, and would therefore lead to an underestimate of SOC \nstocks.\n3. There were significant differences in the BC contents for the three urban centres \nstudied, with the largest values occurring in Glasgow where coal ash was known \nto have been used widely as a soil conditioner.\n4. A TOC determination of the residue of a soil sample subjected to LOI may be a \ncost-effective approach for providing an estimate of its BC content. However,\nfurther research is necessary to determine an optimum temperature for the LOI \npart of the procedure.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank all the staff of the British Geological Survey and volunteers involved in the \ncollection and analysis of soil samples in the G-SUE (Geochemical Surveys of Urban \nPage 19 of 38\nSoil Use and Management\nSoil Use and Management\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review\nSoil organic carbon in UK urban areas  20\nEnvironments) project.
