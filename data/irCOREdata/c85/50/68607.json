Introduction\nIt is both an honour and a particular pleasure to have been invited to speak at the meeting\ncelebrating the scientific career and achievements of Joe (W F) Vinen. His name has been\nfamiliar to me since my undergraduate days at Queen\u2019s University, Belfast, where I was required\nto read, understand, and answer an examination paper on Atkins\u2019 (then new) monograph [1]\non liquid helium. It was full of enthusiastic and detailed discussions of the Hall and Vinen\nexperiments on rotating helium [2], which I found absolutely fascinating. Little did I guess\nthat I would later meet, and have the pleasure of getting to know, both Henry Hall and Joe\nVinen.\nUnlike the other speakers at the meeting, I have never collaborated formally with Joe, or\nco-authored a paper with him, and to that extent I am an imposter. Nonetheless, as I shall seek\nto show, we have shared many interests in common over the years, and many of our activities\nhave been complementary and mutually reinforcing. In particular, activities in the Lancaster\nexperimental programme have owed much to Joe\u2019s encouragement and insight. Many of our\nobservations were predicted by him, sometimes decades in advance. And he has usually been\nquick to propose imaginative explanations, I think invariably correct, of unexpected results\nemerging from the cryostat.\nI now propose to address the problem of how vortices are created ab initio in superfluid\nhelium. In section 2 I will review very briefly the idea of superfluidity and quantized\nvortices. I will outline the nucleation problem in section 3, and will explain how it was\nattacked experimentally in section 4. Possible connections between quantized vortices and\nthe early universe are discussed in section 5, where I will summarize the current status of\n2recent \u2018cosmological experiments\u2019 on the formation of topological defects in phase transitions. \nFinally, in section 6, I will seek to draw some conclusions.\n2. Superfluidity and quantized vortices\nAs it cools through the lambda (superfluid) transition, at temperature T\u0015 D 2:17 K under the\nsaturated vapour pressure, liquid 4He undergoes a marked change of phase to a new state.\nThe properties of the liquid above and below the transition are so strikingly different that the\nphases are called He I and He II respectively. He II behaves as though it were a mixture of two\ndistinct but completely interpenetrating fluids: a normal-fluid component that has viscosity\nand entropy; and a superfluid component with neither viscosity nor entropy. The two fluids\nare physically real to the extent that e.g. their densities can be measured experimentally [3],\nand their flow velocities can be separately described and measured [1, 4].\nThe superfluid component of He II, which is characterized by a macroscopic wave function\n(a complex scalar order parameter), has some very unusual properties. Its inviscid character\nmeans that no pressure head is required to maintain flow through very narrow orifices or tubes\nand, correspondingly, that a moving object does not experience the usual drag force. Even\nmore remarkable is the fact that the superfluid does not rotate\u2014at least not in a conventional\nmanner.\nIf a bucket of He II is rotated slowly, the superfluid component remains at rest relative\nto the fixed stars. For faster rotations, Hall and Vinen showed [2] that quantized vortex lines\nappear in the liquid, parallel to the axis of rotation. For sufficiently high angular velocities,\nwith a large density of lines, the liquid simulates the solid-body rotation that had been observed\nearlier by Osborne [6] and\u2014provided one does not look too closely\u2014it acquires a conventional\nparabolic surface. It is interesting to note that the non-rotation at small angular velocities of\nthe container is a fundamental property of the liquid, and not just because it is hard for the\ncontainer walls to get a grip on something as slippery as a superfluid: Hess and Fairbank\nshowed [5] that, when a slowly rotating container of liquid 4He is cooled through the lambda\ntransition, the nascent superfluid is formed in a state of zero angular velocity.\nThe most remarkable feature of these vortex lines is their quantization. The possibility\nwas first suggested by Onsager [7], and was enthusiastically endorsed by Feynman [9], but it\nremained no more than an idea until Joe\u2019s celebrated vibrating wire experiment [8]. As shown\nin figure 1, he demonstrated beyond all doubt that the circulation\n\u0014 D\nI\nvs \u0001 dl D n\n\u0012\nh\nm4\n\u0013\n(1)\nwhere the integral is taken round a closed loop, vs is the superfluid velocity, m4 is the 4He\natomic mass, and n is an integer. In practice, he found that either n D 0 (i.e. no vortex around\nthe wire) or n D \u00061. This quantization can be seen as a natural consequence of London\u2019s\nsuggestion that the superfluid can be described in terms of a macroscopic wave function [10].\nFollowing the pioneering observations of quantized vortex lines [2, 8] it quickly became\napparent that they are by no means confined to rotating He II, but that they can appear under\na wide range of different circumstances: in fact, whenever the liquid is treated at all roughly.\nFor example, in addition to the orderly arrays of lines in rotating He II, random tangles of\nvortex line can be created (always with n D 1) when critical velocities are exceeded in flow\nand thermal counterflow experiments [11\u201313], by ultrasound [14], and by focused second\nsound [15]. Quantized vortex rings\u2014rather like smoke-rings, with the charge trapped on the\nvortex core\u2014can be created by moving ions [16\u201318]. In fact, as demonstrated by Awschalom\nand Schwarz [19], it is apparently impossible to prepare a macroscopic sample of He II without\n      3\nFigure 1.

The abscissa unit is the quantum of circulation, \u0014 D h=m4.\nvortex lines: there seem always to be some remanent vortex lines pinned cobweb-like between\nsmall protuberances on the walls, in metastable equilibrium. It is notable that, of the hundreds\nof papers published on the vorticity generated in flow and thermal counterflow experiments,\nalmost all analyse their data in terms of Vinen dimensionless parameters [11].\nDonnelly has provided a detailed account [20] of the nature and properties of quantized\nvortices, including a much fuller set of references than can be given here.\n3. The vortex nucleation problem\nA great deal is known about the properties of quantized vortices, based on the kinds of\nexperiment mentioned above, as well as many others [20]. We now consider the rather\ndifferent, but equally important and, in some ways, more fundamental question: where do\nthe vortex lines come from? How do they get into the liquid in the first place? This question\ncannot be addressed via any kind of bulk experiment, because of the remanent vorticity. The\ncritical velocities observed in flow experiments, for example, refer to the conditions needed for\nthe expansion and growth of pre-existing vortex lines\u2014and not to the creation of vortex lines\nab initio. One approach to the problem is to study the transition from ions to charged vortex\nrings: the ions are so small that they are most unlikely to be affected by remanent vorticity.\nThe experimental programme at Lancaster, for which Joe\u2019s ideas and insights have been\nso valuable, has been based on the so-called negative ion. This is a spherical void in the\nliquid created by an excess electron. With a radius of \u00181 nm and a hydrodynamic effective\nmass of \u0018100m4 (both quantities are pressure dependent), the negative ion provides a semi-\nmacroscopic charged probe that can be used to investigate the properties of the liquid. It is\neasily created by field emission [21, 22], and its charge enables its position and velocity in\nthe liquid to be tracked. It is especially useful as a probe of liquid 4He which, unlike the rare\nisotope 3He, is magnetically inert.\nAt this point, a warning is necessary. Many of the early ion experiments yielded\ninconsistent results, and it was not until 1980 that the reason for this became apparent: the\nvortex nucleation process is quite extraordinarily sensitive to traces of 3He. Even the\u00182\u000210\u22127\n4parts of 3He in the commercial helium obtained from natural gas are sufficient to change the\nvortex nucleation rate (see below) by several orders of magnitude [23], as shown by the data\nin figure 2. Results obtained up to this time therefore refer, in effect, to the properties of\nextremely dilute 3He\u20134He solutions of unknown concentration, and not to 4He as had naturally\nbeen assumed.\nFigure 2. Measurements [23] of the rate \u0017 at which negative ions nucleate vortex rings in He II as\na function of electric field E, showing the extraordinary sensitivity of this process to the presence\nof 3He isotopic impurities: the circle data are for isotopically pure [24, 25] 4He, and the squares\nare for ordinary commercial helium, which typically contains \u00182 \u0002 10\u22127 of 3He. The curves are\nguides to the eye.\nA method was therefore developed [24, 25] for removing the 3He isotopic impurities. It\nwas based on the so-called heat-flush phenomenon, using a \u2018wind\u2019 of normal-fluid component\nfrom a heater to blow away the 3He atoms, while collecting the isotopically pure superfluid\ncomponent. The product 4He is believed to be devoid of 3He. Of course this cannot be\nproved; but the 3He\u20134He isotopic ratio has been measured as <2 \u0002 10\u221215. Remarkably, for\nsuch a seemingly useless product, pure 4He produced in this way has also found several other\napplications. It has been used e.g. to support experiments on 2D ion pools below the superfluid\n4He surface [26], 2D electron sheets above the surface [27], quantum evaporation [28], and\nultra-cold neutrons [29].\nUsing isotopically pure superfluid 4He, it became possible to investigate the vortex\nnucleation process and, in particular, to test Joe Vinen\u2019s prophetic suggestion from 1961 [30]\nthat \u2018: : : the creation of vortex line is opposed by a large potential barrier\u2019. We will consider\nthe corresponding experiments, and how they were accomplished, in section 4.\nPerhaps stimulated in part by the Lancaster ion experiments, and in part by a controversy\n[32, 33] about the way in which the initial vortex appears on the moving ion, Muirhead,\nVinen and Donnelly (MVD) calculated Joe\u2019s energy barrier [31] for the case of a negative\nion. They considered the two possible nucleating geometries sketched in figure 3, with the\nnascent vortex appearing either as a symmetrically placed encircling ring, or as a tiny loop\nwith its ends pinned to the surface of the ion. In the first case [33] it was supposed that the\nion would quickly move sideways and become trapped on the vortex core. In both cases, it\nwas expected that the charged-vortex-ring complex would be stable, and that it would grow\nrapidly and slow down [17] under the influence of an applied electric field. MVD calculated,\n      5\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 3. Creation of a charged vortex ring by a moving ion: the two different nucleating geometries\nconsidered by Muirhead, Vinen and Donnelly [31]. Either the nascent vortex ring first appears\nwhole, symmetrically placed about the axis of motion (a), or it first appears as a tiny loop whose\nends are pinned on the ion (b).\nfor different initial ion velocities, as a function of the loop\/ring radius R, the change in energy\n1E that would occur if the ring\/loop were created at constant impulse. Some of their results\nfor loops are shown by the curves in figure 4. At low initial velocities, the process cannot\noccur while conserving energy. Above a critical velocity of \u001860 m s\u22121, however, nucleation\nbecomes energetically possible. The process is impeded by the effective energy barrier to the\nleft of the point at which the 1E.R\/ curve first crosses (or touches) the 1E D 0 axis. MVD\nalso performed similar calculations for the other nucleating geometry (creation of an encircling\nvortex ring) and found very much higher critical velocities, thereby demonstrating the physical\nimplausibility of the latter process.\n4. Vortex nucleation experiments\nThere is a fundamental problem in designing vortex nucleation experiments using ions in a\nsuperfluid. The simplest imaginable approach would be somehow to move the ion at a constant\n6Figure 4.

For comparison, the\nmeasured [42] activation energy for vortex creation is shown by the bar.\nspeed, to measure the nucleation probability, and then to repeat the experiment for different\nspeeds, pressures and temperatures. But, given that any electric field, however small, will cause\nthe ion to accelerate (almost) without limit, how can one control the ionic velocity? Some of\nthe early experiments [34,35] achieved control by balancing the force from an applied electric\nfield against the drag force arising from the scattering of excitations (phonons and rotons) at\ntemperatures in the 0.3\u20131.0 K range. With the clear vision of hindsight, we can now appreciate\nthat this approach was unlikely to lead to useful results because the vortex nucleation rate\nrises exponentially fast with T (see below) in this range, quite apart from the 3He effect [23]\nmentioned above.\nIn the Lancaster experiments, a different approach has been used. The speed of the ion is\ncontrolled by balancing the force of the applied field against the rate of momentum loss caused\nby roton creation above the Landau critical velocity. The technique relies on the assumption,\napparently vindicated by the results, that roton creation and vortex nucleation are independent\nprocesses. It relies on earlier observations [16, 36] that, provided the He II is under sufficient\npressure, negative ions can reach velocities near vL without immediately nucleating and being\ntrapped on vortex rings, and the subsequent demonstration [37] that even modest electric fields\nare sufficient to propel the ions at speeds significantly above vL. Measurements [38] of the\ndependence of drag on velocity showed that the drag on a moving ion remains negligibly\nsmall until vL is attained, and then rises quickly, as shown in figure 5. (Later, more accurate,\nmeasurements [39] showed that, within experimental error, the onset of drag occurs at precisely\nthe predicted value of vL.) The behaviour at pressures below\u001811 bar is entirely different. The\nions then create charged vortex rings almost immediately because, as it turns out, vL is then\ngreater than the critical velocity for vortex nucleation. If the 4He is not isotopically purified\nthen, again, the ions create charged vortex rings almost immediately for T < 0:35 K, even\n      7\nFigure 5. A demonstration [38] of roton emission by ions exceeding the Landau critical velocity\nvL in He II. Drag on the moving ion remains negligibly small for velocities below vL; but, above\nvL, it rises rapidly. For comparison, the quite different behaviour seen in He I is shown by the line\nrising from the origin.\nwhen P > 11 bar [40]. But, by using isotopically purified 4He pressurized to P > 11 bar, one\ncan readily control the speed of the ions, within the range just above vL, by adjustment of the\napplied electric field.\nThe technique [41] devised for investigating the nucleation process is based on electric\ninduction, using the arrangement sketched in figure 6. As a disk of ions with charge q moves\nat average velocity Nv between electrodes (approximated as being of infinite area) separated by\nL, an induction current\nic D q Nv\nL\n(2)\nmust flow from the collector if it is to be kept at a constant potential. If, however, some of the\nions nucleate vortex rings, the charged rings will expand and slow down very quickly indeed.\nIn effect, therefore, the contribution to ic from any particular ion abruptly disappears when it\nnucleates a ring. The anticipated probabilistic [34, 35] decay of the ensemble of ions should\ntherefore show up as an exponentially decaying current at the collector\nic D\n\u0012\nq Nv\nL\n\u0013\nexp.\u2212\u0017t\/ (3)\nwhere \u0017 is the vortex nucleation rate. This is precisely what was observed, as shown in figure 6.\nThe technique was used to explore a large volume of the multi-dimensional parameter\nspace in terms of T ; P;E and the 3He concentration x3 (down to the 10\u22129 level). A typical set\nof data [42] for pure 4He is shown in figure 7. It can be seen immediately that \u0017 is constant at\n8Figure 6.

The curves represent fits to each set of\ndata of an equation of the form\n\u0017.T \/ D \u0017.0\/ + A exp.\u2212\u000f=kBT \/ (4)\nwhere \u0017.0\/; A and \u000f are constants. It was found that \u000f=kB D .3:1 \u0006 0:8\/ K. This behaviour\nstrongly suggests that the system tunnels through a barrier at low T , but can be thermally\nactivated over it at higher T . The measured barrier height [42] is compared with MVD\u2019s\nprediction [31] in figure 4, where the experimental value is shown by the bar. The agreement\nis quite remarkably good\u2014indeed even better than could reasonably have been expected, given\nthe approximations inherent in the MVD model. It can be regarded a triumphant confirmation\nof Joe Vinen\u2019s insights [30] of 1961.\nThe MVD calculations were also extended [43] to encompass the influence of 3He isotopic\n     9\nFigure 7.

The underlying idea is that the binding energy of a 3He atom on the outside of the\nion [46, 47] might be less than its binding energy on the nascent vortex loop. If so, the atom\ncould liberate energy by transferring from the ion to the vortex, effectively reducing the critical\nvelocity. This approach explained immediately the extraordinary sensitivity of \u0017 to traces of\n3He, and it accounted for all the main features of the experiments [44].\n5. Quantized vortices and the early universe\nIt seems at first sight astonishing that there can be any relationship at all between the early\nuniverse and the properties of liquid helium. Yet there are some very interesting conceptual\nconnections [48]. Cosmologies based on grand unified theories (GUTs) imply that a symmetry-\nbreaking phase transition took place very early on, at t \u0018 10\u221235 s after the big bang, as the\nuniverse fell through a critical temperature of T \u0018 1027 K. In this transition, the Higgs fields\nacquired finite values, the forces of nature became distinct, and the false vacuum gave way to\nthe true vacuum that we know today. At the same time, it is thought that topological defects in\nspace-time would have created because of the causal disconnection of separated regions, via\nthe Kibble mechanism [49]: e.g. cosmic strings [45] with\nMass \u0018 1018 tonnes m\u22121\nRadius \u0018 10\u221231 m\nLength \u0018 light years\nSpeed \u0018 c:\nCosmic strings are of particular interest and potential importance because they may have\nprovided the primordial density inhomogeneities on which the galaxies later condensed.\n10\nA major problem in assessing the truth or otherwise of this idea is the non-repeatability\nof the experiment\u2014which has only been run once, when the observable universe was about\nthe size of a grapefruit, and when there was nobody around to see what happened. Zurek\npointed out [50] however that, although experiments at 1027 K are far beyond any imaginable\nextension of our present technology, it may be useful to explore mathematically analogous\ncondensed matter systems. He suggested that the similarities between the lambda and GUT\ntransitions are such that an investigation of the former under non-equilibrium conditions may\nhelp to illuminate the remote and inaccessible events that may have occurred during the latter.\nThe analogy arises because both transitions can be considered to be of second order, and\nbecause the complex scalar order parameter (macroscopic wave function) 9 of 4He is similar\nto commonly considered cosmological order parameters, so one can infer correspondences:\nHiggs field 1 ! Re 9\nHiggs field 2 ! Im 9\nFalse vacuum  ! He I\nTrue vacuum  ! He II\nCosmic string ! Quantized vortex line:\nThe basic idea, therefore, was to take liquid 4He through the lambda transition fast, and to see\nwhether vortex lines were created in the process. Zurek realized that the large specific heat\nof liquid 4He near T\u0015 precludes the possibility of cooling it quickly through the transition, but\nthat there was no reason why it should not be expanded very rapidly through the transition as\nsketched in figure 8. He also made estimates of the vortex line densities to be expected, as a\nfunction of speed through the transition.\nZurek\u2019s ideas were realized first by exploiting, not the lambda transition, but (weakly\nfirst-order) phase transitions in liquid crystals [51,52]. The \u2018bulk version\u2019 [53] of the proposed\nFigure 8. Zurek\u2019s suggestion [50,53] (schematic) for a cosmological experiment in liquid helium.\nA sample of liquid 4He is expanded rapidly through the lambda transition, and is expected thereby\nto create vortex lines as an analogue of cosmic strings. (Note that the actual expansion trajectories\nare not isothermal [55].)\n   11\n4He experiment was later carried out using a specially designed expansion apparatus [54],\nand seemed to reveal that large densities of vortex lines are created at the transition, just as\npredicted. An unexpected observation in the initial experiments [54] was that small densities of\nvortices were created even for expansions that occurred wholly in the superfluid phase, provided\nthat the starting point was very close to T\u0015. The phenomenon was initially [55] attributed to\nvortices produced in thermal fluctuations within the critical regime, but Joe pointed out [56]\nthat effects of this kind are only to be expected for expansions starting within a few \u0016K of\nthe transition, i.e. much closer than the typical experimental value of a few mK. The most\nplausible interpretation\u2014that the vortices in question were of conventional hydrodynamic\norigin, arising from non-idealities in the design of the expansion chamber\u2014was disturbing,\nbecause expansions starting above T\u0015 traverse the same region. Thus some, at least, of the\nvortices seen in expansions through the transition were probably not attributable to the Kibble\u2013\nZurek mechanism as had been assumed. It has been of particular importance, therefore, to\nundertake a new experiment with as many as possible of the non-idealities in the original design\neliminated or minimized.\nAn ideal experiment would be designed so as to avoid all fluid flow parallel to surfaces\nduring the expansion. This could in principle be accomplished by e.g. the radial expansion of\na spherical volume, or the axial expansion of a cylinder with stretchy walls. In either of these\ncases, the expansion would cause no relative motion of fluid and walls in the direction parallel\nto the walls and presumably, therefore, no hydrodynamic production of vortices. The walls of\nthe actual expansion chamber [54, 55] were made from bronze bellows, thus approximating\nthe cylinder with stretchy walls. Although there must, of course, be some flow parallel to\nsurfaces because of the convolutions, such effects are relatively small. It is believed that the\nsignificant non-idealities, in order of importance, arose from: (a) expansion of liquid from the\nfilling capillary, which was closed by a needle valve 0.5 m away from the cell; (b) expansion\nfrom the shorter capillary connecting the cell to a Straty\u2013Adams capacitive pressure gauge;\n(c) flow past the fixed yoke on which the second-sound transducers were mounted. In addition\n(d) there were complications caused by the expansion system bouncing against the mechanical\nstop at room temperature.\nThe experiment has therefore been repeated [57], taking appropriate measures to minimize\nthese problems. The new expansion cell is sketched in figure 9. The main changes from the\noriginal design are as follows: (a) the sample filling capillary is now closed off at the cell\nFigure 9. The improved expansion cell [57] used to minimize flow parallel to solid surfaces in the\n\u2018bulk version\u2019 [53] of Zurek\u2019s experiment.\n12\nitself, using a hydraulically operated needle-valve; (b) the connecting tube to the pressure\ngauge has been eliminated by making its flexible diaphragm part of the chamber end-plate; (c)\nthe second-sound transducers are also mounted flush with the end-plates of the cell, eliminating\nany support structure within the liquid; (d) some damping of the expansion was provided by\nthe addition of a (light motor vehicle) hydraulic shock-absorber.\nFollowing an expansion though the transition, a sequence of second-sound pulses is\npropagated through the liquid. If the anticipated tangle of vortices is present, the signal\nmay be expected to grow towards its vortex-free value as the tangle decays and the attenuation\ndecreases. Signal amplitudes measured just after two such expansions are shown by the data\npoints of figure 10. It is immediately evident that, unlike the results obtained from the original\ncell [54], there is now no evidence of any systematic growth of the signals with time or,\ncorrespondingly, for the creation of any vortices at the transition. One possible reason for this\nis that the density of vortices created is smaller than the theoretical estimates [50, 53, 58], but\nwe must also consider the possibility that they are decaying before they can be measured: there\nis a \u2018dead period\u2019 of about 50 ms after the mechanical shock of the expansion, during which\nthe resultant vibrations cause the signals to be extremely noisy (which is why the error bars\nare large on early signals in figure 10.\nFigure 10. Evolution with time t of the second-sound amplitude S [57], following an expansion\nof the cell at t D 0. The data are scaled by the amplitude S0 of the second sound in the absence of\nvortices. They were derived from two different expansions along the same trajectory, starting above\nthe lambda line. The curves show the signal evolutions to be expected for initial line densities of,\nfrom the bottom: 1012; 1011 and 1010 m\u22122.\nThe rate at which a tangle of vortices decays in this temperature range is determined by\nthe Vinen [11] equation\ndL\ndt\nD \u2212\u001f2 h\u00af\nm4\nL2 (5)\nwhere L is the length of vortex line per unit volume, m4 is the 4He atomic mass and \u001f2 is\na dimensionless parameter. The relationship between vortex line density and second-sound\n    13\nattenuation is known [20] from experiments on rotating helium, and may for present purposes\nbe written in the form\nL D 6c2 ln.S0=S\/\nB\u0014d\n(6)\nwhere c2 is the velocity of second sound, S0 and S are the signal amplitudes without and with\nvortices present, B is a temperature-dependent parameter, \u0014 D h=m4, and d is the transducer\nseparation.\nIntegrating (5) and inserting (6), one finds immediately that the recovery of the signal\nshould be of the form\u0014\nln\n\u0012\nS0\nS\n\u0013\u0015\u22121\nD 6c2\n\u0014Bd\n\u0012\n\u001f2\n\u0014\n2\u0019\nt + L\u22121i\n\u0013\n: (7)\nOf the constants in (7), all are known except \u001f2 and B which seem not to have been measured\naccurately within the temperature range of interest. A subsidiary experiment [57], deliberately\ncreating vortices by conventional means and then following their decay by measurements of\nthe recovery of the second-sound signal amplitude, allowed \u001f2=B to be determined. This\nmeasured value was then used to calculate the evolution of S=S0 with time for different values\nof Li , yielding the curves shown in figure 10. From the quench time \u001cQ D .17 \u0006 1\/ ms\nmeasured during the expansion, and Zurek\u2019s estimate [58] of\nLi D 1:2\u0002 10\n12\n.\u001cQ=100 ms\/2=3\n.m\u22122\/ (8)\nwe are led to expect that Li \u0019 4 \u0002 1012 m\u22122. A comparison of the calculated curves and\nmeasured data in figure 10 shows that this is plainly not the case. In fact, the data suggest that\nLi is smaller than the expected value by at least two orders of magnitude.\nIn the light of the apparently positive outcome of the earlier experiment [54], this null result\nhas come as a considerable surprise. It is worth commenting, first, that Zurek\u2019s estimates ofLi\nwere never expected to be accurate to better than one, or perhaps two, orders of magnitude, and\nhis more recent estimate [59] suggests lower defect densities. So it remains possible that his\npicture [50,53,58,59] is correct in all essential details, and that the improved experiment with\nfaster expansions now being planned will reveal evidence of the Kibble\u2013Zurek mechanism in\naction in liquid 4He. Secondly, however, it seems surprising that comparable experiments on\nsuperfluid 3He [60,61] seem to give good agreement with Zurek\u2019s original estimates [50,53,58]\nwhereas the present experiment apparently shows that they overestimate Li by at least two\norders of magnitude. It is not yet known for sure why this should be. Thirdly, an interesting\nexplanation of the apparent discrepancy in terms of thermal fluctuations changing the winding\nnumber has recently been suggested [62] by Karra and Rivers.\n6. Conclusions\nThe ion experiments have demonstrated inter alia that\n(a) vortex nucleation is impeded by an energy barrier, as inferred [30] by Joe in 1961;\n(b) nucleation involves tunnelling through the barrier, or thermal activation over it, and the\nexperiments [42] have confirmed the barrier height calculated [31] by Muirhead, Vinen\nand Donnelly;\n(c) the extreme sensitivity of the nucleation rate to traces of 3He arises because the 3He atom\nis more strongly bound to the nascent vortex loop than to the ion, and the experiments [44]\nyield results in good agreement with calculations [43] by Muirhead, Vinen and Donnelly\nbased on this idea.\n14\nThe main conclusion from the experiments on vortex creation at the lambda transition must be\nthat further work is needed, both experimental and theoretical. But it can also be concluded\nthat vortices generated through the Kibble mechanism, if any, appear at densities lower by a\nfactor of at least 100 than the initial predictions [50,53]. Finally, I would like to quote a couple\nof lines from Elgar\u2019s oratorio The Apostles [63] \u2018: : : and our name shall be forgotten in time,\nand no man have our work in remembrance : : :\u2019.\nThis must of course be true for all of us. But Elgar says nothing about the time constant\ncharacterizing this forgetting! Good science, which is influential and gets into the standard\ntexts and monographs, is characterized by a long time constant. I am entirely confident that\nJoe Vinen\u2019s time constant will prove to be very long indeed.\nAcknowledgments\nI am much indebted to Roger Bowley, Martin Dodd, Phil Hendry, Stuart Lawson, Richard Lee,\nFrank Moss, Graham Nancolas, Philip Stamp and Charles Williams\u2014as well as to Joe Vinen\nhimself\u2014for their support and encouragement over the years.
