INTRODUCTION\nThe interaction of particles, i.e., drops, droplets or clus-\nters, plays an important role in various natural phenomena\nand technical applications. Understanding of collision dy-\nnamics of binary droplets under different conditions is perti-\nnent to a broad range of processes including nucleation and\ngrowth of aerosols in the atmosphere;1,2 technical sprays\nused in material manufacturing processes, internal combus-\ntion engines, surface treatment and coating;2\u20134 sintering dur-\ning which bulk material is generated through interparticle\ncollisions, where the properties of the material depend\nstrongly on the shape of the coalescence or agglomerated\nparticles;5,6 and growth, handling and utilization of atomic\nand molecular clusters,7 particularly as applied in cluster\nbeams, where the growth of clusters is driven by monomer\naddition and cluster coalescence.8 Furthermore, research\nstudies have been conducted to understand the fundamental\nmechanisms associated with coalescence of liquid drops9 as\nwell as drop deformation and breakup in viscous flows.10\nBinary collisions of particles can occur at different scales\nranging from macroscopic particles, such as raindrops, down\nto nanosized particles, i.e., clusters and nanodroplets. In the\ncontext of macroscopic scales, binary collisions of droplets\nhave been the subject of extensive investigations over the\nlast few decades. Experimental studies of Ashgriz and Poo,1\nQian and Law,2 Brazier-Smith et al.,11 Brenn et al.,12 and\nWillis and Orme13,14 have identified four main collision\nmodes: coalescence, reflexive separation, stretching separa-\ntion, and shattering. Models predicting the outcome of a col-\nlision for a given set of initial conditions have been devel-\noped and enhanced using experimental results, e.g., Ashgriz\nand Poo,1 Post and Abraham,3 Ko and Ryou,4 Brazier-Smith\net al.,11 Arkhipov et al.,15 and Gopinath and Koch.16 How-\never, the details of the collision processes are difficult to be\nobtained through experiments, especially at small length and\ntime scales.\nAs an alternative, numerical simulations can be employed\nto shed light into the details of collisions. Previous studies on\nthree-dimensional simulations of binary droplet collisions\nhave been presented by Rieber and Frohn,17 based on the\nincompressible Navier-Stokes equations in conjunction with\nthe volume-of-fluid method, and Schelke and Frohn18 based\non the lattice Boltzmann equation method. Mashayek et al.19\nused the Galerkin finite element method to simulate the coa-\nlescence of liquid droplets in two dimensions. The method is\nlimited to coalescence and cannot handle separation. Mele\u00e1n\nand Sigalotti20 employed smoothed particle hydrodynamics\n\u0001SPH\u0002 to simulate the binary collisions of equal-sized drops\nin two dimensions, while simulations based on the incom-\npressible Navier-Stokes equations covering main modes of\nbinary droplet collisions have also been recently presented\nby Pan and Suga.21\nAt nanoscale, the atomic structure of the particles be-\ncomes important since they consist of a few hundred or thou-\nsand of atoms. At present, these scales are not directly acces-\nsible by experiments, hence, numerical simulations become\neven more important. Quantum mechanical methods such as\nthe density functional theory \u0001DFT\u0002 would give the most\naccurate results, but they are computationally very expensive\nand can only be applied to small clusters. Molecular dynam-\nics \u0001MD\u0002 methods based on phenomenological potential\nfunctions to model interatomic interactions have turned out\nto be an excellent tool for conducting numerical experiments\nat small scales. Continuum methods would reduce the com-\nputational effort even further, but they are not valid in the\nnanoscale range.\nGreenspan22 and Greenspan and Heath23 presented two-\ndimensional \u00012D\u0002 and three-dimensional \u00013D\u0002 molecular dy-\nnamics simulations of droplets consisting of 1128 molecules\ninteracting via a Lennard-Jones potential. The simulations\nshowed that coalescence, stretching separation, and shatter-\ning modes occur for droplet collisions at nanoscale. Wyatt24\npresented results from MD simulations of binary collisions\nof \u0001H2O\u0002400 droplets using the simple point charge model\n\u0001SPC\u0002 and a newly derived hybrid model \u0001HYB\u0002 for the wa-\nter molecules. The first systematic investigations of binary\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B 74, 235415 \u00012006\u0002\n1098-0121\/2006\/74\u000123\u0002\/235415\u000116\u0002 \u00a92006 The American Physical Society235415-1\ncollisions were performed by Ming et al.25 for Ar1000 clus-\nters, for different collision velocities and angles, confirming\nthe modes found in previous studies, i.e., coalescence,\nstretching separation, and shattering. Svanberg et al.26 em-\nployed the same setup for the simulation of \u0001H2O\u0002125 and\n\u0001H2O\u00021000 and performed simulations for two different initial\ntemperatures of 160 K and 300 K in conjunction with the\nSPC water model. They found that the boundary between\ncoalescence and stretching separation is in good agreement\nwith macroscopic models. However, reflexive separation\nwhich is observed at macroscale was not found in any of the\nabove investigations. In a previous study, the authors have\ninvestigated the collision dynamics of the head-on impact of\na small cluster \u0001Ar309\u0002 onto a large cluster \u0001Ar10973\u0002 for a\nbroad range of impact speeds.27 Both clusters had an initial\ntemperature of 5 K. In addition to coalescence, the collisions\nresulted in partial scattering, eversion, and total disintegra-\ntion \u0001shattering\u0002.\nFor sintering, collisions between clusters at thermal ener-\ngies, i.e., at very low speeds, which are likely to lead to the\ncoalescence of the involved particles, play a key role at\nnanoscale level. MD simulations of these processes are per-\nformed by starting with two equilibrated clusters, initially\nplaced in single point contact with each other. As the simu-\nlation advances, the attracting interatomic forces cause the\ncoalescence of the two clusters, which takes place through\ntwo distinguishable stages: Initially a neck, following a\npower-law growth, forms between the clusters. The neck dis-\nappears later and one particle is formed. Several authors have\ncompared MD results with phenomenological models for\ncoalescence time, neck growth, surface area reduction, tem-\nperature change, and change of gyration radii. Simulations\nfor coalescence of Si15 clusters were carried out by Blaisten-\nBarojas and Zachariah.28 A combination of MD and DFT\nwas used by Schmidt et al.29 to study the fusion and reaction\ncross sections of small metal-metal cluster collisions. Zacha-\nriah and Carrier6 performed MD simulations to investigate\nthe morphology of particles in binary collisions of spherical\nsilicon particles, created by coalescence of zero impact factor\n\u0001see Sec. IV for definition\u0002, and validate phenomenological\nmodels of particle growth. They found that the shape of the\ngenerated particles \u0001from 30 up to 480 atoms\u0002 depends on the\nsize and temperature of the original particles. Similar simu-\nlations were performed by Hawa and Zachariah30 for\nhydrogen-neutralized silicon particles in order to investigate\npossibilities of controlling the size of silicon particles gener-\nated through vapor phase. Hawa and Zachariah also devel-\noped a mathematical model for the coalescence of coated\nparticles31 and extended the investigations to coalescence of\nunequal sized particles.32 Rogan et al.33 used the embedded\natom method \u0001EAM\u0002 potential to model binary collisions be-\ntween small gold clusters and observed fusion, fragmenta-\ntion, and scattering collision modes. Arcidiacono et al.34\nhave performed MD simulations of coalescence of solid gold\nnanoparticles for sintering processes. The clusters were mod-\neled by using the glue potential. They reported that coales-\ncence of gold clusters with radii greater than 20 \u00c5 agreed\nwell with macroscopic phenomenological models, whereas\nfor smaller particles the models do not hold.\nThe aim of the present study is to investigate a variety of\nphenomena occurring during the binary collision between\nspherical particles at nanoscale \u0001henceforth called clusters\u0002\nfor a broad range of collision angles and impact speeds. We\nhave employed the molecular dynamics method in conjunc-\ntion with the 12-6 Lennard-Jones \u0001LJ\u0002 interaction potential\nfor modeling the interatomic forces, so that the results are\napplicable for a range of materials. Each cluster consists of\napproximately 10 000 atoms, which is about one magnitude\nbigger than the largest cluster that has been used in previous\nbinary collision studies. We attempt to shed light on the col-\nlision dynamics at nanoscales and examine similarities be-\ntween nanoscales and macroscopic scales. Qualitative com-\nparisons with previous MD studies and analytical prediction\nmodels derived for macroscopic droplet collisions are also\npresented. In addition to the collision identification ap-\nproaches that have been used in previous MD studies, we\npropose an alternative identification scheme that enables\nclassification of the collision phenomena into main modes\nand submodes with respect to different collision angles and\nimpact speeds. Finally, we investigate whether the collision\nmode referred to as reflexive separation, which has been ob-\nserved in macroscopic droplet collisions, occurs at\nnanoscale. The paper is organized as follows. Sections II and\nIII present the molecular dynamics model and definitions of\nseveral parameters, respectively, which are used in the analy-\nsis of the results. Section IV presents the initial setup of the\nnanoparticles. The results are discussed in Sec. V including a\ndescription of the identification criteria used in the classifi-\ncation of the collision dynamics modes. Comparisons of the\npresent results with previous findings related to macroscale\ndroplets are discussed in Sec. VI. Section VII summarizes\nthe main conclusions of the study.\nII. MOLECULAR MODEL AND SIMULATION METHOD\nThe investigation of collision dynamics phenomena has\nbeen carried out using the MD approach.35 MD calculates the\ntrajectory of a molecular system through phase space. The\ntrajectory data including positions, velocities, and accelera-\ntions of all atoms over the simulated time can be processed\nto study the collision dynamics in detail. MD is a standard\ntool for cluster simulations and has been employed in several\nprevious investigations of cluster-cluster23\u201327,33 and cluster-\nsurface collisions.36\u201340\nThe clusters of the present study consist of atoms that are\nmodeled by the widely used 12-6 Lennard-Jones \u0001LJ\u0002 poten-\ntial. For two atoms i and j the LJ potential is defined by\nVijLJ\u0001rij\u0002 = 4\u0001\u0003\u0004 \u0002\nrij\n\u000512 \u2212 \u0004 \u0002\nrij\n\u00056\u0006 , \u00011\u0002\nwhere rij is the distance between the two atoms. Choosing\nappropriate values for \u0001 and \u0002 allows modeling of different\nmaterials. The LJ potential models best the van der Waals\nforces between atoms of noble gases such as argon.\nTo reduce the computational cost, previous MD studies of\nclusters, e.g., Ming et al.,25 employed a cutoff distance of\nrc=2.5\u0003\u0002. However, in a recent study27 we found that the\ntrajectory is incorrectly altered when using a cutoff distance\nless than 5\u0003\u0002. Therefore, the distance of 5\u0003\u0002 has been\nused in the present simulations. To further speed up the simu-\nMARCO KALWEIT AND DIMITRIS DRIKAKIS PHYSICAL REVIEW B 74, 235415 \u00012006\u0002\n235415-2\nlation an neighbor list algorithm has been employed in con-\nnection with the cell method.35,41\nThe atomic trajectories are computed using an adaptive\npredictor-corrector algorithm.42 Similar to previous\ninvestigations,27 we have used a dimensionless time step of\n0.0023. The nondimensionalization is defined according to\nTable I and is based on the atomic mass ma and the Lennard-\nJones parameters \u0002 and \u0001. For the case of argon, these pa-\nrameters take the values ma=39.948 amu \u0001Refs. 25 and 27\u0002\nand \u0001=1.654\u000310\u221221 J, \u0002=0.341 nm.35\nIII. DEFINITIONS\nDifferent criteria have been used for analyzing the com-\nputed trajectories. Collision fragments that are formed during\nthe collision process are classified according to their size.\nThe absolute size, S\u0004, of a fragment \u0004 is defined as the num-\nber of atoms of the fragment. The relative size, s\u0004, is the\nnumber of atoms of fragment \u0004 relative to the initial number\nof atoms in one cluster N \u0001s\u0004=S\u0004 \/N\u0002. Using the relative size,\nfragments have been classified into four categories: very\nlarge, large, medium, and small \u0001Table II\u0002. The largest frag-\nment is labeled as F1 with a relative size s1; the second, third,\nand Nfth largest fragments are labeled as F2 ,F3 , . . . ,FNf with\nrelative size s2 ,s3 , . . . ,sNf.\nDepending on the collision dynamics, there may be one or\ntwo main fragments. We define as scattered atoms all atoms\nthat do not belong to the main fragments,\nNsca = \u00072N \u2212 S1, one main fragment,2N \u2212 \u0001S1 + S2\u0002 , two main fragments.\b \u00012\u0002\nFor the identification of fragments the nearest-neighbor\ndistance criterion of Stoddard43 has been applied with a criti-\ncal atom separation of rcl=1.76. A description of the frag-\nments\u2019 detection algorithm can be found in Ref. 27.\nThe analysis of collision dynamics involves the calcula-\ntion of several fragment and cluster properties; henceforth,\nthe word fragment will apply to clusters as well. For a frag-\nment F\u0004 the center r\u0004 is considered as the center of mass.\nThe translational and angular velocities are v\u0004 and \u0001\u0004, re-\nspectively. \u0001\u0004 is calculated from angular momentum l\u0004 and\nthe inertia tensor I\u0004. In the analysis, we have considered both\ninternal and external energies. The internal potential energy\nEp,int\n\u0004 of a fragment F\u0004 is calculated by the sum of the inter-\nactions between the atoms within the cluster. Furthermore,\nthe internal, Ek,int\n\u0004\n, and external, Ek,ext\n\u0004\n, kinetic energies are\nused in the analysis of the results. Ek,int\n\u0004 comprises the linear,\nEkl,ext\n\u0004\n, and the angular, Eka,ext\n\u0004\n, parts. The calculation of these\nTABLE I.

Each cluster consists of N=10 973 atoms,\nhas a diameter of d\n27, a temperature of 0.33, and an in-\nternal potential energy of Ep,int\n8\u0003104. They have been\nspherically cut from a face-centered cubical crystal and\nequilibrated over 100 000 time steps.\nThe collision dynamics is investigated with respect to\nrelative speed u and impact parameter X. The absolute ve-\nlocities are given by\nvA =\n1\n2\u000bu00 \f, vB = \u2212 12\u000b\nu\n0\n0 \f , \u00014\u0002\nfor the clusters CA and CB, respectively. The linear momen-\ntums are pA=NmavA and pB=NmavB; the initial relative mo-\nmentum is p=2Nmau; and the total linear momentum is pt\n=pA+pB=0.\nThe impact parameter, X, determines how far off-center\nthe collision occurs and is defined as the distance from the\ncenter of one cluster to the relative velocity vector u origi-\nnating from the center of the other cluster.1 Nondimension-\nalizing X yields x that can be easily related to the collision\nangle \u0004 \u0001Fig. 2\u0002,\nx =\nX\nd\n, x = sin\u0001\u0004\u0002 . \u00015\u0002\nFor x=0 \u0001\u0004=0\u00b0 \u0002 both clusters are subject to head-on colli-\nsion, whereas for x=1 \u0001\u0004=90\u00b0 \u0002 the collision is marginally\navoided.\nTABLE III.

Furthermore, simulations were performed for\nselected x and u, to obtain a clearer understanding of the\ntransition between the collision modes and to render more\nprecisely the location of the transition lines. Simulations\nwere conducted for up to 100 000 time steps \u0001a nondimen-\nsional time interval of 232\u0002.

This collision\nmode is referred to as coalescence \u0010henceforth labeled as\n\u0001I\u0002\u0011. For higher x and\/or u values the collision yields two\nmain fragments and in some cases it may also include satel-\nlite droplets. As it will be described later in more detail, the\ntemporarily formed cluster separates after being stretched,\nthus the mode is referred to as stretching separation \u0010labeled\nas \u0001II\u0002\u0011. A third collision mode, shattering \u0010labeled as \u0001III\u0002\u0011,\nwhich corresponds to the destruction of both clusters, occurs\nfor high velocities, u, in connection with low impact factors,\nx. In the following section, classification of the collision\nmodes is presented in detail.\nA. Modes classification\nDifferent techniques and criteria can be used for identify-\ning the collision modes. One possibility is to classify the\ndynamics visually as done in experiments.1 The same proce-\ndure can be used in the context of MD simulations and,\nadditionally, one can obtain a more thorough analysis of the\ndynamics using the computed trajectories. To identify the\ncollision modes the following parameters were employed:\nthe relative size of the largest, s1, and second largest frag-\nment, s2; and the difference of the relative sizes of the two\nlargest fragments s\r1\u22122\r= \rs1\u2212s2\r. These parameters are calcu-\nlated at different times \u0001Table III\u0002 depending on the duration\nof the collision. The values of these parameters for different\nimpact factors and velocities are given in Tables IV\u2013VI.\nFIG. 7. \u0001Color online\u0002 Collision typical to coalescence mode\n\u0001x=0.36, u=1.58\u0002 with the resulting cluster taking a dumb-bell\nshape.\nFIG. 8.

The collision modes can then be classified as\n\u0001I\u0002 Coalescence for s1\bcA1=70%.\n\u0001II\u0002 Stretching separation for s2\bcA2=20%.\n\u0001III\u0002 Shattering for s1\u0006cA1=70% and s2\bcA2=20%.\nEven though these criteria allow, in theory, a collision to\nbelong simultaneously in coalescence and stretching separa-\ntion modes, none of the simulated cases resulted in this sce-\nnario. Applying the above criteria in conjunction with the\ncomputed s1 \u0001Table IV\u0002 and s2 \u0001Table V\u0002 yields the collision\nmodes of Fig. 4. The transition between coalescence and\nstretching separation is clearly identified. The shattering\nmode is somewhat arbitrarily defined due to the diffusive\nnature of the transition towards shattering compared to the\nother two collision modes.\nIdentification scheme B: This scheme uses s\r1\u22122\r, i.e., the\nsize difference of the largest and second largest fragment, to\ndistinguish between coalescence and stretching separation\nmodes based on a threshold value, c2=15%. It also examines\nthe percentage of scattered atoms Nsca \/N instead of defining\nthe shattering mode. The criteria for scheme B are listed as\nfollows:\n\u0001I\u0002 Coalescence for s\r1\u22122\r\bcB=15%.\n\u0001II\u0002 Stretching for s\r1\u22122\r\u0006cB=15%.\nFigure 5 demonstrates application of the above criteria on\nthe present MD results. The shading denotes the intensity of\nscattering \u0001Nsca \/N\u0002, where the dark areas correspond to\nstrong scattering. The collision dynamics discussed in the\nnext sections is based on the identification scheme B. The\nboundaries between the collision modes are shown in Fig. 6\nincluding various submodes, which are explained in detail in\nthe following sections.\nB. Coalescence (I)\nGenerally, the coalescence mode prevails at low veloci-\nties, u, and\/or small impact parameters, x. Common to all\ncollisions belonging to this mode is the formation of one\nmain cluster or a droplet that is created by the two original\nclusters. Scattering of atoms occurs only at high velocities.\nThe structure, shape, temperature, and motion of the final\naggregate as well as the dynamics of the collision process\ndiffer within the coalescence mode. The present simulations\nrevealed three different submodes: \u0001a\u0002 sticking mode, \u0001b\u0002\nslide and locking mode, and \u0001c\u0002 droplet mode. The locations\nof these submodes are illustrated in the x-u diagram of Fig.\n6. Transition between submodes occurs gradually, thus colli-\nsions occurring in the vicinity of borderlines encompass fea-\ntures of two different submodes.\n1. Sticking mode (Ia)\nFigure 6 shows that for u\u00061.58 the sticking submode\ncovers the entire range of impact factor x, except for x\n\b0.87, where the collision results in both clusters sticking\ntogether, while their internal structures remain intact. The\nshape of the resulting cluster resembles that of a dumb-bell\n\u0001Fig. 3\u0002 thus it is also referred to as dumb-bell mode.23\nThe collision dynamics of a typical \u0001Ia\u0002 case, e.g., x\n=0.36 and u=1.58, is shown in Fig. 7. During impact, only\nthe material near the contact interface is deformed. Once the\ndumb-bell cluster is created, the two clusters are locked to\neach other. The translational motion is transformed into ro-\ntation. The trajectories of the two original clusters, CA and\nCB, are plotted in Fig. 8, starting on the left-hand side for CA\nand on the right-hand side for CB, respectively. For the stick-\ning mode case \u0001x=0.36, u=1.58\u0002 the initially straight path is\nfollowed by a circular one \u0001dashed line in Fig. 8\u0002. The point\nat which the motion changes is marked as the contact point\nand this is exactly the position where the two clusters come\ninto contact.

The distance between\nthe mass centers of the two initial clusters, rA,B, remains\nconstant after the clusters have come in contact with each\nother \u0001Fig. 9\u0002.\nFigures 10 and 11 show the variation of the angular ve-\nlocity \u0007z\n1 and angular momentum lz\n1 in time of the dumb-bell\ncluster F1. Before the initial clusters come in contact there is\nno rotation. Following impact, the angular momentum, wz\n1\n,\nsteeply rises and reaches a plateau value, while, as expected,\nthe angular momentum lz of the resulting cluster is conserved\n\u0001Fig. 11\u0002.\nFor impact factors x\u00060.2 the collision can still be char-\nacterized as sticking mode, even for velocities u\b2, with the\noriginal clusters being flattened at impact. The dumb-bell\nshape appearing at lower u is replaced by an elliptical or a\nspherical shape. A typical example is the collision for x=0\nand u=3.17 \u0001Fig. 3\u0002. The change of rA,B is shown in Fig. 9.\nThe distance between the cluster centers is smaller compared\nto the case of \u0001x=0.13, u=1.58\u0002. By increasing further the\nimpact velocity \u0001u\b4\u0002, the collision mode will gradually\nchange to the droplet mode. The collision in sticking mode is\ngoverned by transformation of the initial external linear ki-\nnetic energy Ekl,ext into internal kinetic energy Ek,int, internal\npotential energy Ep,int corresponding to the structural\nchanges of the deformation, and angular kinetic energy\nEka,ext.\n2. Slide-and-locking mode (Ib)\nThe slide-and-locking mode forms a narrow \u0001transition\u0002\nregion in x-u space between coalescence and stretching sepa-\nration \u0001Fig. 6\u0002. The collision dynamics for a typical case \u0001x\n=0.36, u=3.17\u0002 is shown in Fig. 12. The clusters are flat-\ntened at impact \u0001t=4.6\u201311.6\u0002 and the initial contact point\nevolves to a flat circular interface. The heat generated at the\ncontact interface liquifies the material in this region and a\n\u0001liquid\u0002 layer with reduced friction is formed acting as a\ncushion between the clusters facilitating sliding along each\nother. The direction of the clusters\u2019 motion is slightly de-\nflected outwards and aligns parallel to the contact interface.\nDuring sliding the heat is dissipated away from the interface\nto the rest of the cluster thus cooling down the interface and\nincreasing friction. The linear motion is transformed into ro-\ntation of the entire complex. Eventually, the interface locks\nand the sliding motion completely stops leaving behind a\nrotating cluster. The shape of the resulting cluster depends\nmainly on the extent of flattening and sliding of the original\ncluster.\nThe motion of the clusters can be traced by plotting\nthe position of the mass centers projected onto a two-\ndimensional plane \u0010solid line, \u0001Ib\u0002 case in Fig. 8\u0011, where the\ncontact and locking points as well as sliding area are shown.\nAfter the initial contact the clusters\u2019 trajectories remain par-\nallel to each other, while symmetry is preserved throughout.\nAs the friction increases, the trajectories enter a circular mo-\ntion and the contact interface is locked thus not permitting\nfurther sliding of the clusters. The distance of the mass cen-\nters, rA,B \u0001Fig. 9\u0002, shows that the closest approach occurs\nimmediately after the clusters have come in contact. The\nFIG. 13.

The initial, linear kinetic energy,\nEkl,ext, is transformed into: \u0001i\u0002 internal potential energy, Ep,int,\ncausing deformation and increasing pressure; and \u0001ii\u0002 internal\nkinetic energy, Ek,int, in the vicinity of the contact interface.\nDuring the sliding-and-locking phase, the remaining part of\nEkl,ext is transformed into Ek,int and angular kinetic energy,\nEka,ext, of the entire cluster.\nIncreasing the velocity u results in faster and longer slid-\ning motion, which eventually leads to the separation of both\nclusters; this is the transition to stretching separation mode.\nHigher values of x entail a smaller contact interface. Conse-\nquently, the transformation of impact energy, Ekl,ext, into\nheat, Ek,int, and deformation, Ep,int, takes place slower and\ntherefore leads to stretching separation.\nWe further comment on how the classification of sticking\nmode \u0001Ia\u0002 and slide-and-locking modes \u0001Ib\u0002 has been ob-\ntained.

An example is given in Fig. 13 for constant u=3.17 and\nincreasing x. Because the trajectories of CA and CB are sym-\nmetrical, only those of CA are displayed. The path for x\n=0.0 is a straight line \u0001central collision\u0002, but because there is\nno sliding, the collision is characterized as \u0001Ia\u0002. The path for\nx=0.13 shows no distinct linear section and is therefore con-\nsidered to belong to mode \u0001Ia\u0002. Note that the short straight\nline is due to compression and flattening of the cluster, thus it\ndoes not account for sliding. Increasing the values of x to\n0.24 and 0.36, a distinct linear segment can be found in the\ntrajectories following the contact point. Hence, both cases\nare regarded as mode \u0001Ib\u0002. The classification of the collision\nmodes was also checked by examining simulation movies\ncreated using the computed trajectories.\n3. Droplet mode (Ic)\nFor impact factors x\u00060.2 and velocities u greater than\napproximately 4.5 the collision dynamics is classified as\ndroplet mode \u0001Fig. 6\u0002. The high impact energy results in one\nmain fragment in liquid phase. In contrast to the previous\ncases where the original clusters can still be identified within\nthe newly formed aggregate, in the droplet mode the material\nof the two initial clusters is mixed. The droplet mode also\ninvolves significant scattering and evaporation as can be seen\nfrom Tables IV\u2013VI.\nThe collision dynamics for a typical example \u0001x=0.13 and\nu=5.33\u0002 is shown in Figs. 14 and 15, where each column\nshows a different view: from the side \u0001along the z axis\u0002,\nalong the velocity vector u, and from a perspective view. The\nclusters are flattened along a planar contact interface\n\u0001t=4.6\u0002. Radial, disclike scattering originating from the con-\ntact interface is observed at t=4.6 and t=9.3. The scattering\nis due to the transformation of the largest part of impact\nenergy into heat at the contact interface. The internal pres-\nsure force acts outwards and is opposed by an inward pres-\nsure force due to the interatomic and deceleration forces.\nBecause the pressure acting perpendicular to u is much\nsmaller than the one acting in the direction of u the contact\ninterface expands radially. The expansion overcomes the\nbinding forces and results in asymmetric scattering, which\nreaches a peak value at t\n14. While the contact interface\nwidens out into a circular plane, asymmetric momentum dis-\ntribution forces the planar interface to bend and take an\nS-like shape \u0001see, e.g., side view at t=23.2 in Fig. 14\u0002. The\nonset of this behavior is already visible in the slide-and-\nlocking case \u0001Fig. 12\u0002. At later times an elongated droplet is\nformed \u0001t=138.9 in Fig. 15\u0002, which finally approaches a\nspherical shape \u0001last row of Fig. 15\u0002.\nDuring the collision process, evaporation and condensa-\ntion of the liquid and gas atoms, respectively, occur. The\nprocess leads gradually to reduced size and temperature of\nthe formed droplet, while the evaporation rate is also gradu-\nally reduced. The effect of evaporation is encountered by\ncondensation of the vapor phase surrounding the droplet.\nWhen the rate of evaporation equals the rate of condensation\nan equilibrium is achieved. To examine evaporation and con-\nfirm the spherical shape of the final fragment, we have ex-\ntended the simulations for x=0.13,u=5.38 until t=925. The\nchange of absolute size S1 and temperature T1 of the largest\nfragment, F1, are shown in Fig. 16. The initial stages are\ndominated by scattering and from t=34 onwards the decay in\nS1 is caused by evaporation. The sudden change at t=122 is\ndue to the separation of a satellite droplet; cf. t=69.5 and\nt=138.9 in Fig. 15. The reduction of the absolute size S1\nshows an asymptotic behavior towards the end of the simu-\nlation.\n4.

According to \u00017\u0002 the angular momentum\nof the final fragment is determined by the initial setup. The lz\n1\nvalues obtained from the simulations are shown in Fig. 17\nand agree exactly with the values calculated by \u00017\u0002, i.e., fol-\nlow a linear variation with slope 12Nmau. Because the angular\nmomentum is conserved the angular velocity \u0007z\n1 depends\nonly on the shape of the final fragment. Figure 18 shows that\nlarger impact factors result in larger \u0007z\n1\n. Deviation from this\nbehavior is observed for u=3.17 and x=0.36 because of the\nslide-and-locking effect \u0001cf. Fig. 12\u0002, which results in high\nvalues of Izz, due to the elongated shape of the formed clus-\nter.

Normal stretching separation (IIa)\nCollision dynamics in normal stretching separation share\nsimilarities with the slide-and-locking coalescence mode\n\u0001Fig. 6\u0002. The major difference is that for the normal stretch-\ning separation the sliding motion is so distinct that stretching\nof the temporarily formed cluster causes separation again.\nBelow we explain the collision dynamics for a typical case\ncorresponding to x=0.42 and u=3.17 \u0001Fig. 20\u0002. The first part\nof the collision is identical to that in slide-and-locking mode.\nFollowing the impact both clusters are flattened along the\ninterface plane and start to slide along each other. In contrast\nto mode \u0001Ib\u0002 the sliding motion lasts longer because of\nhigher velocity u and\/or smaller contact interface due to\nhigher x. As the sliding continues the distance between the\noriginal clusters increases. This leads to a narrower contact\ninterface and reduced binding forces. Eventually, the contact\ninterface shrinks until it breaks. At this point the temporary\ncommon fragment has turned around 135 degrees before\nsplitting into two clusters again. The centrifugal forces pre-\nvail over the binding forces, whereas in mode \u0001Ib\u0002 the situa-\ntion is reversed. Figure 20 shows that from t=23.2 onwards\nthe interface starts to contract until it becomes very thin at\nt=115.2 and eventually breaks apart.\nThe trajectories of the original clusters CA and CB, as well\nas the distance rA,B, are plotted in Figs. 21 and 22, respec-\ntively. The trajectories indicate sliding after the first contact\nof the clusters. The clusters enter a circular path and the\ndistance rA,B increases linearly \u0001or almost linearly\u0002 for all\ncases in collision mode \u0001II\u0002. Note that there is no discontinu-\nity at the separation point.\nThe conversion of the initial translational energy Ekl,ext is\nidentical to mode \u0001Ib\u0002. The only difference is that during\nstretching and separation the angular energy of the temporary\naggregate is transformed back into translational energy Ekl,ext\nof the two final main fragments.\n2. Stretching separation with satellite droplets (IIb)\nFor high velocities \u0001u\b3.93\u0002 and for a broad range of\nmoderate impact factors \u00010.13\u0005x\u00050.7\u0002 the collisions be-\nlong to stretching separation mode including production of\nsatellite droplets \u0001Fig. 6\u0002. A satellite droplet is a large frag-\nment which is not, however, one of the main fragments. Fig-\nure 23 shows the development of the collision for x=0.42\nand u=4.75. Note that the impact parameter is the same as\nfor mode \u0001IIa\u0002, but at higher impact velocity. Similar to mode\n\u0001IIa\u0002 the collision begins with flattening of the colliding clus-\nters along a contact interface. Because of the higher initial\nimpact energy, in the present case the process features scat-\ntering and faster stretching motion. Therefore, less rotation\nof the temporary common fragment occurs for \u0001IIb\u0002 com-\npared to \u0001IIa\u0002.\nThe material at the contact interface is stretched into a\nlong tubular mass. Around t=69 one can observe the forma-\ntion of three necks along the stretched connection. These are\nthe points in which the connection breaks into two satellite\ndroplets, while the two main fragments still continue to\nmove straight into opposite directions \u0001see Fig. 23 for\nt=92.6 and t=115.6\u0002.\nFIG. 25.

After a short sliding the main fragments\ncontinue to travel along a straight line and, therefore, the\ndistance rA,B increases linearly in time \u0001Fig. 22\u0002.\n3. Shearing-off (IIc)\nFor x\b0.8 the overlapping cross section of the original\nclusters \u0001see Sec. IV\u0002 becomes very small, thus the collision\nis minimized and the internal structure of the original clus-\nters is not significantly altered. This case is referred to as\nshearing-off mode and a typical scenario is demonstrated in\nFig. 24 for x=0.87 and u=6.33. The trajectories are shown in\nFig. 21 and the distance of the mass centers in Fig. 22. The\nbinding forces of the material in the collision region are too\nsmall to withstand the inertia of the entire cluster, thus frag-\nments of the material are sheared off. The collision also re-\nsults in slight rotation of both clusters. In the shearing-off\nmode a small percentage of Ekl,ext is converted into potential\nenergy, Ep,int, and kinetic energy, Ek, of the scattered atoms.\n4. Effects of the impact factor on stretching\nseparation mode\nTo assess the effects of the impact factor, x, on the clus-\nters\u2019 deflection and molecular mixing, we have employed\ntwo parameters: \u0001i\u0002 the deflection, \t, of a cluster, which is\ndefined by the angle between the initial velocity vector, u,\nand the velocity vector of the cluster after the collision; and\n\u0001ii\u0002 the mixing parameter, mf, representing the mass fraction\nof a main fragment that consists of atoms from the other\ncluster.\nThe difference of \tA and \tB was insignificant for all\ncases: less than 5% for high u in connection with low x,\notherwise less than 1%. Figure 25 shows the average of \tA\nand \tB against different impact factor values. As expected, \t\ntends to zero when x\u21921. For u=3.17, \t increases exponen-\ntially when decreasing x; lower x entails higher overlapping\nregions leading to stronger interaction with the highest value\nmeasured in the borderline to coalescence \u0001for x=0.5\u0002, where\nthe common cluster rotates 135 degrees before it separates.\nThe mf values for the two main fragments differ less than\n6% for low x combined with high u and less than 1% in all\nother cases. Figure 26 shows the averaged mass fraction mf\nagainst x. The three curves for the velocities almost coincide,\nsuggesting that the impact velocity has no influence. Instead,\nthe mixing depends primarily on the impact factor and in-\ncreases faster for smaller x, reaching a peak value of\nmf=0.36 for x=0.13.\nVI. DISCUSSION AND RELATION TO MACROSCOPIC\nDROPLET COLLISIONS\nIn the past, collisions of droplets at macroscopic scales\nhave been the subject of many experimental1,2,11,12,15 and\nnumerical17,18 investigations. The setup of these experiments\nis very similar to the present simulations. There are, how-\never, two noticeable differences. First, the length scale of the\npresent simulations is smaller by five orders of magnitude\nthan the macroscopic droplet experiments. Second, in the\nmacroscopic case the droplets are in liquid phase and\nretain the same temperature throughout the simulation. At\nnanoscale the temperature of the clusters varies significantly\nduring the development of the collision: the clusters are ini-\ntially in a solid phase and depending on the collision sce-\nnario they are transformed to liquid droplets. Similar to pre-\nvious studies,23\u201326 we examine below similarities in the\ncollision dynamics of droplets at macroscale and nanoscale,\ndespite the mentioned differences.\nBinary droplet collisions at macroscales are characterized\nby the impact factor x and the Weber number, We\n= \u0001\nd \/\u000b\u0002u2, where \n is the density and \u000b is the surface ten-\nsion. Four modes have been observed: coalescence, stretch-\ning separation, reflexive separation, and shattering. These\nmodes correspond to the ones described in the preceding\nsection for collisions at nanoscale. The reflexive separation\nmode is observed at macroscales for almost central collisions\n\u0001x\u00060.25\u0002 at high velocities \u0001We\f19\u0002.1 Here, the two drop-\nlets merge to a temporary common droplet, which is elasti-\ncally flattened into a disclike or a toruslike shape during\nimpact. The subsequent reflexive motion, caused by surface\ntension, reshapes the formed droplet into an elongated cylin-\nder that eventually breaks up into two droplets. Depending\non the values of the Weber number and impact factor satellite\ndroplets may be formed.\nFor the length scales less than 10\u22128 m considered here,\nreflexive separation was not observed. This agrees with pre-\nvious studies for clusters smaller than the ones considered\nhere, e.g., LJ1000,25 \u0001H2O\u0002729,24 and \u0001H2O\u00021000.26 We note\nthat the clusters in the present study are initially in solid state\nand, therefore, one cannot exclude the possibility that reflex-\nive separation may occur for liquids at nanoscale. Because\nthe clusters are immediately liquified one could argue that\nthe initially solid state is not the reason for the absence of\nFIG. 27. Comparison of the macroscopic analytical model\n\u0001dashed line\u0002 of Brazier-Smith et al. \u0001Ref. 11\u0002 \u0010Eq. \u00018\u0002\u0011 with the\npresent MD simulation results as well as an alternative model\nxcrit=au\nb\n, a=2, and b=\u22121.5 \u0001solid line\u0002 proposed here.\nMARCO KALWEIT AND DIMITRIS DRIKAKIS PHYSICAL REVIEW B 74, 235415 \u00012006\u0002\n235415-14\nreflexive separation. Nevertheless, this is a subject of a sepa-\nrate investigation.\nBecause all macroscopic investigations have been carried\nout using liquid droplets, submodes associated with the coa-\nlescence mode have not been previously reported.1 Compari-\nson with the results of Brenn et al.12 shows that the\nformation of satellite droplets in the stretching separation\nmode can be much more pronounced at macroscales than at\nnanoscales.\nPrevious investigations of macroscopic binary droplet col-\nlisions have pursued to find analytical criteria that describe\nthe boundaries between coalescence and stretching\nseparation.1,11,15 Ming et al.25 found satisfactory accuracy be-\ntween MD simulation results for binary collisions of Ar1000\nclusters and the analytical model predictions of Brazier-\nSmith et al.11 The Brazier-Smith model is based on the bal-\nance of centrifugal forces and forces originating from the\nsurface tension. For droplets of the same diameter, d, the\ntransition criterion is given by\nxcrit = \u0004c\t \u000b\n\nd\u00051u , \u00018\u0002\nwhere different values of the constant c have been proposed:\nc=2.50 by Brazier-Smith et al.11 and c=3.47 by Arkhipov et\nal.15 In the present paper the density \n of the initial cluster is\n1.042 ma \/\u00023. In general, it is difficult to estimate the surface\ntension \u000b of Lennard-Jones clusters46 since this depends on\nthe internal structure and temperature of the clusters,47\nwhich, however, changes during the collision process.\nWhen using the same surface tension value as Ming\net al.,25 i.e., \u000b=1.7\u0001 \/\u00022, we obtain similar predictions from\nthe analytical model and simulations. However, the best\nagreement between the Brazier-Smith-Arkhipov model and\nthe present results is obtained for c\t\nd \/\u000b=1.2 \u0001Fig. 27\u0002. For\nthe d and \n considered here, the value of c\t\nd \/\u000b=1.2 im-\nplies a surface tension \u000b in the range of 3.4\u20136.5\u0001 \/\u00022. These\nvalues are still within the range of the surface tension for\nLennard-Jones clusters.48\nThe discrepancies between the analytical models and\nsimulations may be due to the following reasons.\nFor macroscopic particles, the temperature varies insig-\nnificantly compared to the nanoparticle case: the smaller the\nparticle size the higher the temperature rise during the colli-\nsion. Let us consider two pairs of particles a and b with\ndiameters da and db, respectively, and a diameter ratio f , db\n=daf . For identical Weber numbers ub2=ua2 \/ f thereby for\nsmaller particles the impact velocity is higher. Using the\ndefinition of the Weber number, we obtain\nub\n2\n=\nWe \u000b\n\ndaf\n. \u00019\u0002\nFor central impact \u0001X=0\u0002, the external kinetic energy,\nEk ext=\n1\n2mu\n2\n, is converted entirely into internal energy. The\ntemperature then changes as\n\rTb =\nEk ext b\n2cm\n=\nmub\n2\n4cm\n=\nub\n2\n4c\n=\nWe \u000b\n4c\ndaf\n, \u000110\u0002\nwith c being the specific heat capacity, where ub\n2 has been\nreplaced by \u00019\u0002. According to \u000110\u0002, \rTb\u00121\/ f , i.e., the\nsmaller the particles the higher the temperature rise \u0001for bi-\nnary collisions of comparable outcome\u0002.\nAs an example, we compare the temperature rise for water\ndroplets of diameter 500 \u000em, such as in the Ashgriz1\nexperiments, with that of water particles of diameter 10 nm\nas used in the presented study. For a typical Weber\nnumber We=35; density of water \n=1003 kg\/m3;\nsurface tension \u000b=73\u000310\u22123 N\/m; and specific heat capacity\ncp=4.187 J \/gK, the droplets of 500 \u000em colliding with\na velocity of 2.26 m\/s result in a temperature rise of\n3\u000310\u22124 K. This temperature rise should not influence mate-\nrial properties such as surface tension and viscosity. How-\never, for the nanoscale particles with d=10 nm a collision\nwith the same characteristics at 505 m\/s will result in a tem-\nperature rise of 15 K. Monoatomic substances like the ones\nused in the present study have lower heat capacity and, there-\nfore, the temperature rise will be even higher. For the cases\nconsidered in the present paper, We=35 and X=0, the tem-\nperature rise was about 30 K \u0001considering that the LJ-\npotential represents argon cluster\u0002.\nFor the nanoparticles considered here phase transforma-\ntion occurs, with the temperature and phase of the material\ninfluencing the strength of the binding forces and, hence, the\ndetails of the collision dynamics including the transition re-\ngime.\nFinally, scattering of atoms, especially at high impact ve-\nlocities, reduces the size of the clusters in some cases sig-\nnificantly. This effect is not observed in macroscopic droplets\nand it is not, therefore, accounted for by \u00018\u0002. A better fit of\nthe simulation data can be obtained by using xcrit=aub in-\nstead of \u00018\u0002, with a=2 and b=\u22121.5 for best fitting. This result\nis plotted as a solid line in Fig. 27.\nVII. SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS\nMolecular dynamics models offer the possibility to inves-\ntigate the details of nanoparticle \u0001molecular clusters or drop-\nlets\u0002 collisions, which are more difficult to be studied by\nexperiments due to the small length and time scales in-\nvolved. We have investigated the collision dynamics of nano-\nclusters for a broad range of impact factors and speeds. Simi-\nlar to macroscopic droplet collisions, coalescence and\nstretching were also found in the present case. Reflexive\nseparation, another mode observed in macroscopic droplet\ncollisions, was not found for the collision of the initially\nsolid nanoclusters.\nDetailed analysis of the collision processes has revealed\ndifferent submodes that lead to coalescence, which are clas-\nsified according to their dynamics into sticking \u0001Ia\u0002, slide-\nand-locking \u0001Ib\u0002, and droplet \u0001Ic\u0002 modes. Submodes also ex-\nist within stretching separation: normal stretching separation\n\u0001IIa\u0002, stretching separation with satellite droplets \u0001IIb\u0002, and\nshearing off \u0001IIc\u0002. Macroscopic analytical models that de-\nscribe the borderline between coalescence and stretching\nCOLLISION DYNAMICS OF NANOSCALE LENNARD-\u2026 PHYSICAL REVIEW B 74, 235415 \u00012006\u0002\n235415-15\nseparation were found to describe qualitatively the transition\nbetween the two modes at nanoscale. The development of a\nnew analytical model that describes collision mode bound-\naries at nanoscale requires further understanding of the tran-\nsition between modes \u0001Ib\u0002 and \u0001II\u0002. This requires simulations\nfor larger clusters and droplets to be conducted in order to\nfind the lower length-scale limit for the occurrence of reflex-\nive separation. Future studies should also include a vapor\natmosphere surrounding the cluster in order to capture the\nequilibrium between evaporation and condensation.\n*Electronic address: m.kalweit@cranfield.ac.uk\n\u2020Electronic address: d.drikakis@cranfield.ac.uk\n1 N.
