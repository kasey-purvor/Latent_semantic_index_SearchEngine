More specifically, the focus of this article is on Western media \npolicies towards community radio. It is argued that while many community radio discourses, \ntheories and policies are oriented towards developing countries and emerging democracies, \ncommunity radio stations in the West are often forced to operate in the margins. Case studies \non the US, the UK and Belgium will be presented. Some influence of distinct regulatory \nparadigms can be observed, but overall in each of these countries community radio stations \nhave a legacy of struggle for their existence and survival. This exposes the need to account \nfor the distinct nature of community radio in (Western) regulatory regimes. A common thread \nin the cases being presented is the difficulty involved in (local) community radio legitimating \nits existence on the FM-band alongside commercial and public broadcasters. Unlike these, \ncommunity radio movements have little lobbying power and are usually positioned as rogue \nand unprofessional actors within the broadcasting community. From a democratic perspective \nemphasising the importance of participation and civic culture, Western media policies urgently \nneed to create an enabling environment for participatory community radio initiatives.  \n \nKeywords: community radio, regulation, policy, comparative, participatory media \n \nShort Bio: \n \nBart Cammaerts is lecturer in the Department of Media and Communications at the London \nSchool of Economics and Political Science (LSE). His research examines multi-stakeholder \npolicy processes, media strategies of activists, alternative media and issues regarding power, \nresistance and public-ness.

Introduction \n \nIn this article the focus is on the ways in which regulation and media policies \nimpact on a \u2018third type\u2019 of broadcast media, namely participatory radio, \ncomplementary to both commercial and public media. One particular form of \nparticipatory radio, community radio is a salient case to illustrate the \nparticipatory potentials of media. As Lewis and Booth (1989: 8) quite rightly \nstate, community radio \u2018aspires to treat its listeners as subjects and \nparticipants\u2019, not as objects to be educated or persuaded to consume. Radio \nis also a democratic and relatively cheap medium. Fraser and Estrada (2001: \n1) also point out that \u2018[t]o start a small radio station is not as complicated and \nexpensive as many people think\u2019. This is precisely one of the main reasons \nwhy much of the attention in the academic literature on community radio (and \nfunding for research) has been devoted to its potential for empowering \ncommunities in developing countries (see Berrigan 1979; Postgate, et al., \n1979; MacBride, 2004 [1980]; Girard 1992; Siemering 2000; Fraser and \nEstrada 2001; Gumucio 2001; Olorunnisola 2002; Rennie 2006)2. Within this \ntradition of developmental and participatory communication, community media \n\u2013 and radio in particular \u2013 are seen to be potent tools enabling local \ncommunities to represent themselves, challenge and critique authority and \nadvocate for \u2018strong\u2019 citizenship.  \n \nFurthermore, community radio is also increasingly seen as a way to foster \npeace building in post-conflict areas. A recent example of a radio being \nsupported from this perspective is Radio Okapi in Bukavu, East-Congo. This \nlocal FM radio station was founded with the support of the UN and of the \nSwiss foundation Hirondelle (see http:\/\/www.radiookapi.net\/) to promote \npeace in this conflict-ridden region.  \n \nIt is thus fair to say that there is ample evidence that community media and \nradio in particular \u2013 among others because of low literacy levels - is an \nappropriate medium to improve community relations, distribute relevant \ninformation and increase the possibilities for the empowerment of local \ncommunities in developing and democratising countries. At the same time, it \nhas to be noted that community radio can also be quite destructive in terms of \nthe democratic potentials often attributed to it. It suffices to refer to the case of \nthe Rwandan private radio Mille Collines (RTML) and its deplorable role in the \nincitement of racial hatred before and during the genocide on the Tutsi and \nmoderate Hutu population in 1994 (Kellow and Steeves 1998).  \n 3 \n \nHowever, the aim here is not to examine these potentials or restraints, nor to \naddress the use of community media in a developmental context. In this \narticle the focus is on the struggle for existence and survival of community \nradio stations in the West. Why the specific focus on the West? As has been \nshown above, much of the research and theory in terms of community \nradio\/media can be situated within developmental communication and the \ninter-linked field of participatory communication, focussing mainly on Asia, \nAfrica and Latin America, leading to a lack of critical reflection of the role of \ncommunity media in Western democracies and on the importance of \nregulatory regimes in terms of stifling or promoting these media.  \n \nIt is in this regard ironic \u2013 to say the least \u2013 that while many international \norganizations, such as UNESCO, but increasingly also the World Bank, as \nwell as Western development agencies have been or have become strong \nadvocates for the introduction of local community radio stations in Africa, Asia \nor Latin America, community radio in the West has a long legacy of struggle \nfor their right to exist, for adequate frequencies and for (political) recognition. It \nis precisely this paradox that will be addressed here. First, a number of \nregulatory paradigms and models as put forward by Van Cuilenburg and \nMcQuail (2000) and Hallin and Mancini (2004) will be briefly outlined to \nconclude that community media and \u2013radio in particular is totally missing from \nthese paradigms and models. This will be followed by contextualising the \nnotion of \u2018community\u2019 in relation to radio. Then three case studies of rather \ndistinct regulatory environments will be presented, namely: the US, the UK \nand Belgium.  \n \n2. Dominant Regulatory Paradigms and Community Radio \n \nMedia and (tele-)communication have from the outset been the objects of \ngovernment regulation and policy, from the perspective of exerting control \nover the media or channels of distribution, allocating the spectrum, or \nproviding a legal framework for public broadcasting and fostering public \ninterests. In this regard, \u00d3\u2019Siochr\u00fa et al. (2002: 4) state that  \n \nregulation \u2026 is about the use and abuse of power. The real question is \nhow regulation, by that name or any other, is shaped and implemented in \na society, who controls it, how informed people are about it, and how \nthey can participate in determining its priorities. \n \nAccording to Van Cuilenburg and McQuail (2000: 111) three periods in which \na certain paradigm of media regulation was hegemonic can be identified. The \nfirst period ran until the Second World War and was first characterized by \u2018no \npolicy\u2019 and later on by \u2018ad hoc\u2019 or, as Van Cuilenburg and McQuail (2000: 111-\n12) put it. The second period lasted until the 1980s and can be described as \nthe \u2018public service era\u2019 and the third and current period is described by Van \nCuilenburg and McQuail (2000: 112) as the \u2018era of communication policy\u2019 \nrather then media policy, signalling not only the convergence of media and \ntelecommunication policies (Baldwin, et al. 1996), but also the (relative) \ndisengagement of the state from the economy (Swann, 1988), and the \n 4 \ntreatment of media content and communication more as a commodity than a \ndemocratic and public resource (Schiller, 1996).  \n \nThis short overview of regulatory paradigms illustrates that state intervention \nin media and communication systems has to be analysed in an historical \ncontext. However, besides overall paradigms, an historic perspective also \nbrings to light the divergences of regulatory systems from one country to \nanother. In this regard, Hallin and Mancini\u2019s comparative model is very useful. \nThey distinguish between the Mediterranean or polarized model, the \nNorth\/Central European or democratic corporatist model and the North \nAtlantic or liberal model (Hallin and Mancini 2004). In the last model the \nmarket dominates the media-system, in the corporatist model commercial and \npublic service media are combined, while in the polarized pluralist model the \nstate and political elites exert a high degree of control over the media, both \npublic and commercial.  \n \nThe different paradigms identified by Van Cuilenburg and McQuail confirm a \ngeneral paradigmatic trend, but cannot be considered absolute. Peculiarities \nin historical trajectories structure and shape the way in which national media-\nsystems have developed and how certain regulatory regimes were adapted \nand implemented. Similarly, Hallin and Mancini\u2019s attempt to define different \nmodels based on geography and in part also ideology is necessarily a difficult \nexercise where inconsistencies emerge as well. Furthermore, an exclusive \nfocus on the political economy and regulation of the media and \ncommunication \u2018industry\u2019 and\/or on public service broadcasting systems, \ntends to exclude alternative- or community media, often very local, embedded \nin civil society and thus situated in between or relatively independent from \nstate and market.  \n \nAt the end of the 1980s, Lewis and Booth (1989) already pointed out the \nomission of community radio from dominant paradigms and theory building. In \ntheir book \u2018The Invisible Medium\u2019 they not only critique the lack of critical and \nacademic research into and attention for radio as a medium, but also called \ninto question the dominant focus on public and commercial broadcasting, \nimplying that community radio is somehow less important or even irrelevant in \nview of the importance and reach of commercial and public service media. \nInstead, Lewis and Booth (1989: xiii) give \u2018equal status to alternative \ninterpretations \u2013 of history, of current policies and of an alternative practice of \nradio which [they] refer to as \u2018community radio\u2019\u2019.  \n \nAs mentioned earlier, the focus here is on how different Western countries \nhave integrated alternative radio (or not) in their own media policies at a \nnational level. The media policies of three Western countries \u2014 the UK, the \nUS and Belgium \u2014 regarding alternative radio will be explored from a \nhistorical perspective. Whilst the US is a prime example of a liberal \u2018free for \nall\u2019 media policy environment, the UK combines a strong, but highly regulated, \ncommercial sector with an equally strong public service tradition. Belgium is a \nparticular case. It has a strong and dominant public service tradition, but since \nmedia regulation is a matter for the different regions, divergences in media \npolicy between the North and South of the country can be observed.  \n \n 5 \nWhilst these three cases have very different (media-)histories and are \nembedded in distinct regulatory paradigms, it will become apparent that in \neach case community radio has experienced considerable difficulties in \nestablishing and sustaining itself. In what follows the context of community \nradio will be explored further from a theoretical perspective in order to \ndetermine what we understand by this specific \u2018third\u2019 type of media, with a \nspecial focus on its relationship towards communities and participation. \n \n3. Radio for and of the community \n \nAs Lewis and Booth (1989: 4) indicate there exists a plethora of notions that \nattempt to capture participatory forms of radio, among others \u2018listener-\nsupported, community, public, free or alternative radio\u2019. Carpentier et al., \n(2003) identify four ways of conceiving participatory media: 1) as \u2018alternative\u2019 \nto the mainstream, 2) as part of \u2018a community\u2019, 3) as being embedded in \u2018civil \nsociety\u2019 and 4) as \u2018rhizomatic\u2019. This last way of theoretically framing \nparticipatory media relates to Deleuze and Guatari\u2019s metaphor of the rhizome, \nwhich 'establishes connections between semiotic chains, organisations of \npower and circumstances relative to the arts, sciences and social struggles' \n(Deleuze & Guattari 1987: 7). Recognising these different interconnections is \nuseful to overcome the analytical and essentialist identities of civil society \nactivism, the state and the market, as well as the dichotomous boundaries \nbetween mainstream and alternative forms of media. In essence it accounts \nfor the hybridity of participatory media, sometimes adopting mainstream \nformats, receiving state support, or needing some form of commercial \nadvertising or sponsoring to survive.  \n \nAccording to Partridge (1982: 10) the term \u2018community radio\u2019 was first coined \nby Powell (1965) in a leaflet entitled Possibilities for Local Radio. However, \nthe idea of locally embedded small-scale radio, produced and controlled by \ncitizens had been around for a while (for instance US amateur broadcasters \nbefore World War I). Localism is considered to be one of the defining \ncharacteristics of community radio and media. Today, community media is \ndefined as:  \n \ngrassroots or locally oriented media access initiatives predicated on a \nprofound sense of dissatisfaction with mainstream media form and \ncontent, dedicated to the principles of free expression and participatory \ndemocracy, and committed to enhancing community relations and \npromoting community solidarity. (Howley 2005: 2) \n \nHowley\u2019s definition points, among others, to localism as one of the defining \ncharacteristics of community media and radio. He also associates community \nmedia with a wider set of notions and practices, such as participation by \ncommunities in their own media, and producing content for the communities \nthey serve (Kidd 1999). Community media is thus seen to be intrinsically \nlinked to forms of internal basic-democratic procedures, to practices of self-\nmanagement, and to the production of alternative \u2018non-mainstream\u2019 formats \nand content. In this regard, Prehn\u2019s (1991: 259) emphasis on participation as \n\u2018involving people directly in station programming, administration and policy \nactivities\u2019 is highly relevant. From this perspective, community radio \n 6 \ncontributes both to external pluralism \u2013 by being a different voice among \npublic and commercial broadcasters, and to internal pluralism \u2013 by being \nbasic-democratic and providing a platform for a diversity of voices and styles, \noften lacking in mainstream media. \n  \nReality is, however, much messier and does not let itself be framed so easily \n(see Hochheimer 1993; Medrado 2007). Many local community-based radio \nstations fulfill an entertaining and informative function for specific \ncommunities, but do this by re-producing mainstream formats, adopting semi-\nprofessional governing structures, and\/or financing the costs that come with \nrunning the community station with advertising and sponsorships. \nFurthermore, the very notion of community, as gemeinschaft, as close and \nconcrete human ties, as \u2018communion\u2019, as a collective identity, is increasingly \ncontested in itself. Downing et al. (2001: 39), for instance, argue that the \nemphasis on community \u2018rais[es] more questions and dilemmas than it \nanswers\u2019. Western sociological legacy tends to associate community with \nbeing locally embedded, inward looking, contained, homogeneous, having \ncommon interests and sharing similar values and norms (T\u00f6nnies 2001).  \n \nAt least three main challenges can be identified against this view of \ncommunity. First, reducing a community to a local context or setting is \ndeemed to be too limiting. As Lewis (1993: 13) remarks, a community of \ninterest can extend \u2018across conurbations, nations and continents\u2019 and thus \nbypass or transcend the geographically and spacially confined definition. \nSecond, community is also increasingly viewed as not only being determined \nby structures or given characteristics, such as is the case with ethnicity, but \nalso as being constructed, imagined and interpreted (Anderson 1983). A \ncommunity is actively constructed by its members and those members derive \nan identity from this construction. As a result, community also means \nsomething different in a Western then in a non-Western cultural and social \ncontext. Finally, approaching a community as a homogenous group denies \ndemographic stratifications and ideological struggles inherent to all social \nrelations and formations.  \n \nDespite these challenges to the notion of community, Howley\u2019s definition is \nnevertheless useful in a Western context, as it neatly describes the kind of \nparticipatory (local) radio stations addressed here: community-focussed, \nwhich can also be transnational; non-commercial3; experimental; independent; \ncritical; internally democratic; and (mainly) driven by volunteers. Such a \nnarrow definition of community radio in a Western context is most pertinent \nfrom a policy perspective as this type of independent radio often gets \nforgotten \u2014 or rather ignored \u2014 in favour of the interests of commercial \nand\/or public service-type radio stations. However, as will be shown in the \nanalysis below, in recent years a more favourable regulatory environment is \nemerging in several Western countries. In addition to this, the critical and \ndemocratic role of community radio and their contribution to social cohesion \nand to (external and internal) media pluralism and access is increasingly \nbeing recognized. While the ITU\/UN sponsored World Summit on the \nInformation Society rather vaguely called for \u2018support to media based in local \ncommunities\u2019 (WSIS 2003: Article 23j), the European Parliament (2008: 7) \nadvised Member States \u2018to give legal recognition to community media as a \n 7 \ndistinct group alongside commercial and public media where such recognition \nis still lacking without detriment to traditional media\u2019. It will, however, remain to \nbe seen how these - as well as other (Council of Europe, 2008) - recent \nendorsements for community radio will translate in concrete changes in media \nregulation that enables both the emergence of new initiatives, as well as the \nsustainment of older ones.  \n \n4. Community Radio Policies in the West.  \n \nIn this part the regulatory opportunities, but above all constraints, in three \ndifferent countries vis-\u00e0-vis participatory radio, as defined above, will be \naddressed. Rennie (2006: 4) quite rightly points out that \u2018[r]adio and television \nmust exist within regulated media environments \u2013 it is where the battles over \ncommunity access have been fought out\u2019, and are arguably still being fought \nover on a daily basis.  \n \nThe US \n \nWhereas in Europe the boom in community radio stations can be situated in \nthe 1970s-80s, as will be shown later, in the US the 1960s was the period of \ngrowth for participatory radio initiatives. This was, however, preceded by a \nlong tradition in the US of amateur radios prior to World War I, after which \nlicensing regulation was introduced.4 This intervention to regulate \u2018the chaos \nand anarchy\u2019 on the airwaves provoked a fierce battle amongst commercial \nstations bidding to get hold of a licence. Nevertheless, a legacy of educational \nradio, based in universities, assured a distinct voice over the airwaves \n(Sterling and Kittross 2002: 78). In 1941, the educational broadcasters won a \nsubstantial victory when the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) \ndecided to reserve part of the radio spectrum for community and other non-\ncommercial broadcasters. Pacifica Radio (KPFA) in Berkeley, California, \ngenerally considered to be one of the first community radio station in the US, \ntook this opportunity and started transmitting in 1948 with support of its \nlisteners (and still does, see Figure 1). KPFA has been described as \u2018an \nindependent non-profit station supported by listeners subscribers many of \nwhom were pacifists and anarchists\u2019 (Partridge 1982: 17).  \n \nFigure 1: Snapshot of top of donate page on KPFA Website (June 2008) \n \nSource: http:\/\/kpfa.org\/support\/ \n \nThe Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 provided a framework for a US-wide \npublic network and created the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which \n 8 \nwas given the task of funding and supporting local, as well as national, radio. \nMost of the federal money was channelled to National Public Radio (NPR), \nserving as a platform for syndicated programmes made by others and \nbroadcasting to a national audience. Despite this, the 1970s saw a dramatic \nrise in the number of community radio initiatives, mainly run and operated by \nvolunteers on a small-scale basis. It is fair to say that community radio in the \nUS profited at first from the liberal ideology at the heart of US media policies, \nwhich led to a permissive and open regulatory environment for community \ninitiatives.5 The emergence and growth of (local) community radio in the US \ndid not go uncontested though. Both commercial and public broadcasting \norganizations persistently fought the presence of community radio on the \nairwaves. The FCC was not insensitive to the combined lobbying power of the \ncommercial and public broadcasters, and in 1978 it decided to revoke the low \npower licences (of 10 watt). This resulted in the silencing of many the smaller \nand poorer stations (Hilliard and Keith 2005: 186). The only way for \ncommunity radio to survive was to obtain a 100-watt licence, which for most \nwas too expensive. Designing regulation in such a way that it becomes \nimpossible for small-scale media initiatives to flourish, was not unusual in \nmany Western regulatory regimes.  \n \nTo resist the attacks of the commercial and public broadcasters the National \nFederation of Community Broadcasters (NFCB) was set up in 1975 to \nrepresent and defend the interests of US community radio. Not surprisingly, \nmany unlicensed or pirate community radios emerged in the 1980s and \n1990s. Pioneering examples include Black Liberation Radio in Springfield, \nIllinois, which went on the air in 1986, and Free Radio Berkeley, California, \nwhich started broadcasting in 1993 (Sakolsky and Dunifer 1998). These so-\ncalled micro-radio stations provoked immense resistance from both the \ncommercial and public broadcasters who partially feared competition from \nthese stations, but especially frequency interference (Hilliard and Keith 2005: \n191). Due to a lack of funds or because of fines and seizure of equipment by \nthe FCC, most of these micro-radio stations had a hard time sustaining their \nactivities. Evidence of this was the emergence in 1996 of the Grassroots \nRadio Coalition (GRC), a very loose association of stations that reacted \n\u2018against the increasing commercialisation of public radio and lack of support \nfor volunteer-based stations\u2019.6 \n \nAt the end of the 1990s public pressure and street protests in favour of Low \nPower FM (LPFM) stations were growing. These resulted, in 2000, in the FCC \ngranting legal recognition to community LPFM radio services and allowing \nthem to file an application (in selected states at first, but this was extended in \n2001)7. Despite this, Congress amended the FCC ruling, not only banning \n\u2018anyone who had operated an unlicensed micro-station from applying for a \nlegal low-power station\u2019 (Hilliard and Keith 2005: 197), but also calling upon \nthe FCC \u2018to study the economic impact of these new stations on corporate \nradio outlets as well as the \u2026 possibility of interference problems\u2019 (Sakolsky \n2001). This provoked outrage and division within the micro-power radio \nmovement. As a result of Congress\u2019s obstructive tactics lobbied for by \ncommercial broadcasters, only a very limited number of licences were \ngranted. Many community micro-stations continued to transmit illegally but \nsuffered heavy repression. For example, San Francisco Liberation Radio was \n 9 \nraided in October 2003 after criticising the Bush administration\u2019s war in Iraq \nand Free Radio Santa Cruz was closed down in October 2004.8  \n \nIf we take the membership base of the NFCB and the GRC as more or less \nindicative of the number of legally operating community radio stations in the \nUS, we can say that there are about 2400 community radio stations active \nacross the different US-states9. This amounts to an average of 1 community \nstation per 128.000 inhabitants, which is the best ratio compared to the other \ncountry cases outlined below. \n \nSo although a liberal environment could be seen as having been relatively \nbeneficial for the US community media sector, it is also clear from the \noverview above that both the rather weak public broadcasters, but above all \nthe lobby power of commercial interests linked to the media industries, have \nbeen successful at curtailing and restricting the modest openings that were \nmade towards community radio in the US. By revoking the licenses for low-\npower FM radio stations and by disallowing formerly illegal radio initiatives to \napply for a licence, it is obvious that the reality on the ground is still very \ndifficult for most small-scale independent radio initiatives in the US, certainly \nas there is no form of official support for these initiatives available. \n \n \nThe UK \n \nAlthough the UK is generally considered to be in the North-Atlantic liberal \nsphere of influence, the situation for community radio in the UK is very distinct \nfrom the US. In 1951 the UK Beveridge Report on the Future of Broadcasting \nstated: \u2018Use of VHF could make it possible not merely to give the existing BBC \nprogrammes to people who now fail to get them, but to establish local stations \nwith independent programmes of their own.\u2019 (Beveridge Report 1951: 78). \nThose envisaged as possibly operating such community stations included \u2018a \nLocal Authority, a University or a specially formed voluntary agency\u2019 (ibid: 79). \nHowever, given the hegemonic public service logic of the time in Europe these \nambitious plans did not materialize, on the contrary. The BBC was given the \nmeans to expand its activities and operate local or regional radio stations. The \nhegemony of the public broadcaster was first challenged by pirate radio \nstations, operating from fixed structures or broadcasting from ships in \ninternational waters beyond the reach of domestic legislation. In the (short) \nperiod between 1964 and 1967 numerous such stations emerged, including, \nfor example, Radio Caroline, Radio London and Radio Scotland. Despite the \nundoubted and unprecedented success of such stations, most were forced off \nthe air by the 1967 provisions of the Marine and Broadcasting Offences Act \n(Baron 1975).10 \n \nIn addition to the BBC experimenting with local stations, the Sound \nBroadcasting Act of 1972 had transformed the Independent Television \nAuthority into the Independent Broadcasting Authority, giving it additional \npowers to regulate radio. However, while this theoretically allowed community \nstations to exist, it also provided a very strict regulatory framework that was \nonly beneficial for commercially-driven local radio. UK community initiatives \nthat had emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s were left with only one \n 10 \noption and that was operating illegally in addition to campaigning for official \nrecognition. Many of these pirate stations were, or soon became, \nadvertisement funded radio, even though in some cases fulfilling a community \nrole. In 1983 the Community Radio Association11 was founded to represent \ncommunity radio stations with government, industry and regulatory bodies. \n \nDespite the lobby efforts of the CRA\/CMA for political recognition, the \u2013 by \ndefinition \u2013 illegal pirate stations were targeted repeatedly by the Department \nof Trade and Industry (DTI), whose actions were aimed at shutting down the \nbroadcasting operations of illegal broadcasters. A fairly recent example is \nDimension FM, a pirate community radio in Telford in Shropshire. Dimension \nFM started operating in 1999 and played mainly underground electronic music \nthat was largely ignored by mainstream radio at that time, but also had some \ncomedy, prank and phone-in programmes. The station broadcast every \nweekend and as it managed to increase the power of its transmitter \nDimension FM reached a growing community of loyal fans (cf. Figure 2). In \nDecember 2003 the DTI organized a raid on the station, closed it down and \nprosecuted two of its collaborators. Their programmes are archived online.12 \n \nFigure 2: Protest against the raid on Dimension FM (UK) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSource: Dimension FM \n(http:\/\/www.dfmpromotions.com\/radio\/courtcase.htm) \n \n \n \n \nThe idea of a third way radio, complementing the commercial and public \nbroadcasting services, was finally accepted in 2002 when the Radio Authority \nissued licences for 15 of what were then called \u2018access radio stations\u2019. These \nlicences were renewed in 2004. The 2003 Communication Act (HMSO 2003) \nand the 2004 Community Radio Order (DCMS 2004) could be considered \nturning points in the history of community radio in the UK. After a round of \nconsultations, the newly formed media regulator, Ofcom, began to grant full \nlicences for community radio in March 2005. Furthermore, a Community \nRadio Fund was introduced, managed by Ofcom and financed by the DCMS \n(Ofcom 2005). It primarily funds core competencies, such as financial \nmanagement, fundraising and administrative support. By 2008, 187 licenses \nhad been granted and about 120 community radio stations were on air in the \nUK13. This amounts to approximately 1 community radio station per 510.000 \nUK inhabitants.  \n \n \n 11 \nAn interesting example of a thriving licensed community radio is, the East \nLondon-based, Sound Radio, which claims to 'reflect, as far as is possible, the \nmake up of the East London community to whom we broadcast.'14. Sound \nRadio is partly funded by advertising, but uses this to provide access to the \nairwaves for 10 different (diasporic) communities in the London area. It has \nEnglish, Afro-Caribbean, Latin American, Kurdish, Bangladeshi, Jewish, \nTurkish and African programmes. Unlike most community radios, Sound \nRadio broadcasts on AM rather than FM primarily because there was no \nsuitable FM frequency available in the area at the time they got their licence. \nThis allows it to reach a much wider audience, as current FM regulations \nrestrict community radios to a radius of 5 km from their antennae. However, \ngiven the low quality of AM very few people listen to AM radio nowadays. This \nmight explain why Sound Radio, similar to many other community stations, \nalso streams its programmes on the Internet, which is proving to be an \nefficient way to bypass regulatory restrictions, and to attract an international \naudience beyond the UK.  \n \nAs in the US-case this prudent opening of the airwaves for community radio \ndoes not mean that there are no pirate community stations anymore. In 2008 \nsome 80 pirate stations were active in the London area alone, mostly playing \nunderground music. Several websites15 are dedicated to mapping the ongoing \nand fluid landscape of pirate radio in the UK\u2019s capital. It has to be noted, \nhowever, that most of these pirate radios can hardly be characterized as \ncommunity radio. Most of these radio stations are in effect commercial \nstations playing music and promoting parties as well as other commercial \nevents. \n \nThe UK case illustrates that while being situated in a liberal North-Atlantic \nmodel economically, its regulatory regime towards media and communication \nwas for a long time very much in line with the North-European way of doing \nthings with a strong state monopoly on broadcasting. Although the UK did \nopen-up the spectrum for commercial media initiatives much earlier then other \nEuropean countries did, it also designed its broadcasting regulation as such \nthat community radio was in effect forced into illegality, resulting in \nsubsequent repression and criminalization. This policy recently changed to the \nbetter with licenses being issued to community radio stations and financial \nsupport being provided.  \n \nBelgium \n \nAs stated before, Belgium is an all-together different case, for a number of \nreasons. First, it is a Federal state where competencies are divided between \nthe Federal level and the regional entities, media and communication \nregulation is one of these (Burgelman, et al., 1995). Second, it is also a \ncountry with different political cultures and styles. Belgium can be \ncharacterized as a surreal mixture of French statism and Northern-European \npragmatism that sometimes converges, sometimes clashes but often leads to \ndiverging policies in the North and in the South of the country. Dewachter \n(1998: 185 \u2013 own translation) even goes as far as to claim that \u2019[w]hen it \nconcerns media, it is obvious that the Belgian society does not exist anymore\u2019. \n \n 12 \nJust as in the UK, the state monopoly on broadcasting was first challenged by \npurely commercial initiatives, broadcasting from ships in the North Sea from \nthe late 1960s to the early 1970s.16 However, in the late 1970s and early \n1980s a new challenge emerged from terrestrial local FM pirate stations. \nSome of these were community radio stations born out of the anarchist punk \nmovement, the environmental movement and the student movement. Most \nnon-public radio stations challenged the boring formats and paternalistic \ncontent of the public broadcaster, but were also commercial or eventually \nevolved into commercial stations (Drijvers 1992: 107-8).  \n \nHowever, as explained above, from a policy perspective, a clear distinction \nshould be made between developments in the North and the South of \nBelgium, as media regulation and policy became de-federalized in 1971. \nHowever, one notable exception was frequency allocation, which continued to \nbe regulated at federal level until 1990.  \n \nNorth-Belgium \n \nIn the North of the country, an opening for local non-public radio, including \ncommunity radio, was created in May 1982, allowing some pirate stations to \nbecome legal. It is evident, however, that consecutive regional governments \nignored the specificity of community media. For a long time media policy in the \nNorth of Belgium was aimed at protecting the interests of the Dutch-speaking \npublic broadcaster and at preventing national networks of (commercial) radio \nto emerge. Non-public radio was by definition considered to be commercial, \nthereby disregarding the specific requirements of community radio stations \n(Carpentier and Cammaerts, 1993). The regulatory framework was primarily \ngeared to limiting the impact of commercial radios on the media landscape, \nminimize their \u2018market share\u2019 and guaranteeing the dominance of the public \nbroadcaster. In this epic struggle to defend the interests of the public \nbroadcaster against the pressures of commercial interests, the demands of \ncommunity radio stations for a distinct statute did not carry enough weight to \nbe supported by the major political parties (Carpentier 1994; Drijvers 1992). In \n1994 the Organization of Radios for a more Creative approach to Acoustics \n(ORCA) was founded, uniting all four community radio stations in the North of \nBelgium. \n \nDespite this, the ignorance of policy makers for the specificity of community \nradio, was again confirmed in 2002, when the monopoly of the public \nbroadcaster regional coverage of North-Belgium was finally lifted.17 The \nfiercely competitive commercial interests involved in obtaining a regional or \nprovincial license, and the lack of transparency in the allocation process (as \nwell as cases of corruption), relegated the very few community radio stations \nin the North to the margins of the FM-spectrum. Furthermore, their \nbroadcasting range was severely restricted (to maximum 15 watts).  \n \nRadio Centraal,18 a community radio in Antwerp that has over 150 volunteers \nand runs without advertising income, has been most vocal in condemning the \nlack of media policies towards participatory media in consecutive North-\nBelgian governments and the persistent conflation of community radio and \ncommercial radio at a local level (Carpentier 1994). Ironically, the North-\n 13 \nBelgian media regulator, which has the power to sanction radio stations, \nrecently condemned Radio Centraal for boosting its signal beyond the strict \nlimits set by the law, but reduced its penalty because of the specific nature of \nthe station (Vlaams Commissariaat voor de Media 2005). This amounted to a \nfirst \u2013 albeit implicit \u2013 official regulatory recognition of the distinctiveness of \ncommunity radio in the North of Belgium.  \n \nFigure 3: Poster\/Flyer of Radio Centraal celebrating 100 years of international \nwomen\u2019s day \n \nSource: http:\/\/www.radiocentraal.be \n \nBesides Radio Centraal, there are currently only three other community radio \ninitiatives remaining in the North of Belgium; Radio Katanga in Aalst, and two \nstudent radio\u2019s - Radio Scorpio in Leuven and the more recent Urgent FM in \nGhent. No support whatsoever is being given and the regulatory regime also \ndoes not foresee in a specific stature for community radio stations, nor is there \nany support for community-type radio. In the North of Belgium there is \ncurrently one community radio station per 1.500.000 inhabitants. Surprisingly, \nthis has not led to a surge in pirate stations. \n \nSouth-Belgium \n \nA very different picture emerges when examining the South of Belgium and \nBrussels. The South was for one much prompter to allow commercial stations \nto compete with the public broadcaster at national level (1991) then the North. \nSome years earlier, the French-speaking public broadcaster had also been \ngiven permission to broadcast advertising, and a specific statute for \ncommunity radio19 was created within the regulatory framework (Minist\u00e8re de \nla Communaut\u00e9 Francaise 1987). This was in part due to the efforts of \nexisting community stations, some of which formed the Association pour la \nLiberation des Ondes (ALO) in 1978; struggling for the \u2018liberation of the \nairwaves\u2019 and representing French-speaking community radios in the south \nand in Brussels. These included Radio Panik, Radio Air Libre and Atelier \n 14 \nRadio Arlon. The Audiovisual Decree of 1987 even cautioned about being \n\u2018especially careful to facilitate the existence of associative creative radio \nstations\u2019 (Art. 30, own translation). However, in this regard the strong political \ninfluence of France on policies in the South of Belgium should also not be \nunderestimated. For example, France sold TF1 in 1986 and implemented a \nsimilar regulatory shift just a few years before similar policies were decided \nupon in South-Belgium  (Cheval, 1997). \n \nLikewise the policies relating to community radio closely reflect French media \npolicy. A Conseil Sup\u00e9rieure de l\u2019Audiovisuel (CSA) was set-up as the \nregulator and a Fonds d\u2019Aide \u00e0 la Cr\u00e9ation Radiophonique (FACR) was \ncreated to finance specific projects. The fund has supported between 15 and \n40 radiophonic projects annually since 1994 (depending on its financial \navailability). It was initially financed from a percentage of the revenues from \npublic service channel advertising. The new media decree voted in February \n2003 also included commercial radio networks in the funding mechanism of \nthe FACR, although it has to be said that commercial broadcasters fiercely \nresisted this attack on their advertising revenues. The role of FACR is to \npromote: \n \n radiophonic creation in the French-speaking community in Belgium. It \nintervenes in the production costs of original and creative radio, \nvalorising the patrimony of the French-speaking community in the \narea\u2019s of information, documentaries, cultural content, fiction and \nmusic. (FACR 2005: 7 \u2013 own translation).  \n \nIn addition to community radio, individuals and non-profit organizations can \nalso submit proposals, opening-up the airwaves for the broader public and \ncivil society. Furthermore, since 2002 the public broadcaster has been \nrequired to (re-)transmit a minimum of 20 hours a year of productions funded \nby FACR. By 1995, South-Belgium counted 23 community radio stations and \nthe Brussels region 4 (Conseil de l'\u00e9ducation aux m\u00e9dias de la Communaut\u00e9 \nfran\u00e7aise, 1995). This represents one community radio per 160.000 \ninhabitants, which is quite a difference compared to the North. \n \n \nThe Belgian case thus shows us how two completely distinct and to some \nextent even contradictory regulatory regimes co-exist within one country. \nWhile the South (and Brussels) followed French policies very closely, the \nNorth held on to its public service tradition for much longer then was \nnecessary, thereby stifling and excluding community radio projects and \ninitiatives across the North of the Belgium. It is fair to say that the South has \nimplemented a highly enabling environment for community media with a \nspecial statute for community media and innovative \u2013 albeit minimal \u2013 intra-\nsectorial cross-subsidiarity measures. The result is obvious, while in the \ndensely populated North only very few community radio initiatives were able \nto survive, the regulatory environment of the South allows almost 30 \ncommunity radio stations to function and broadcast.   \n \n 15 \n4. Conclusions \n \nOne of the aims of this article was to expose the discrepancy between policies \nof Western countries and of Western controlled international organisation that \nadvocate for community radio initiatives in a developing or peace building \ncontext and the legacy of struggle of community radio in the West.  \n \nThe analysis above exposed that especially in countries with a strong public \nservice broadcasting tradition, community radio is only a fairly recently \nrecognized distinct media space. In countries with a strong liberal tradition, \nsuch as the US, community radio has a longer history and legacy. However, \nthis by no means implies that there was\/is no struggle or conflict regarding the \nright to communicate for community radio stations in the US. A common \nthread in the cases presented above, was the difficulty involved for community \nradio to legitimate its existence on the FM-band alongside commercial and \npublic broadcasters. Unlike these powerful actors, community radio \nmovements had limited lobbying power and were usually positioned as rogue \nor unprofessional amateurs within the broadcasting community. All too often \nthe argument of spectrum scarcity and FM frequency interference was used \nagainst them and\/or regulatory frameworks were designed in such a way so \nas to exclude not-for-profit radio initiatives from the airwaves. This has \nresulted in a tumultuous (and continuing) history of struggle, both in Europe \nand in the US. \n \nTable 1: Comparative overview of community radio history and regulation \n US UK North-Belgium South-Belgium \nRegulatory \nParadigm \nliberal model liberal model democratic \ncorporatist model \ndemocratic corporatist \nmodel \nEmergence of \ncommunity radio \nLate 1940s Late 1960s Early 1980s Mid 1970s \nOfficial \nrecognition \n1941 [full, \ncurtailed from \n1971-2000] \n2002 [full] 1982 [partial] \n \n1987 [full] \nAdvocacy \nOrganizations \nNFCB (1975) and \nGRC (1996) \nCRA\/CMA \n(1983\/1997) \nORCA (1994) \n \nALO (1978) \nEstimated # of \nlegal community \nradio stations \nNFCB, over 2300 \n[in 2002] \u2013 GRC, \n32 \n120 4 23 \nApproximate # of \ninhabitants per \nlegal community \nradio  \n128.000 510.000 1.500.000 160.000 \nState support None Structural funding None Project funding \nPosition of \ncommunity radio \nDependent on \nsubscribers and \ndonations \nNew impetus, but \noften rather \nprofessionally run \nInnovative, but \nweak, no distinct \nstatus \nRather strong, but \ncommercial media \nshould also contribute \nto the FACR \n \nTable 1 exposes the different histories and distinct nature of that struggle. In \nthe US community radio was able to obtain licences at an early stage thanks \nto the efforts of educational radios. However, the combined lobby-power of the \ncommercial and public broadcasters, consistently aimed to marginalize \ncommunity radio, with considerable success. The vastness of the US and the \nliberal model does however result in the lowest ratio of number of inhabitants \n 16 \nper community radio. Subscriber-schemes and a tradition of listeners \nsupporting radio stations, keeps many of them running and assures some \ndegree of (financial) independence. \n \nIn the UK, the dominance of the public service model, which applies to some \nextent to the commercial sector as well, meant many years of repression for \nthe UK community radio sector. Only recently, the UK has created a specific \nlegal status for community radio and actively promotes the emergence of new \ncommunity radio initiatives throughout the UK through structural funding. This, \nhowever, is not entirely unproblematic as it might lead to a partial \nprofessionalization and commercialization of the UK community radio sector. \nThe UK still scores rather bad on the ratio number of inhabitants per \ncommunity radio, but is handing out more licences, so this is expected to \nimprove.  \n \nIn Belgium two distinct systems can be observed. Legally, community radio in \nthe North is treated in the same way as local commercial radio, while in the \nSouth community radio has a specific legal status. Support is given in the form \nof project funding which is financed by a tax on the advertisement revenues of \nthe public broadcaster. In the North, not surprisingly, the worst ratio number of \ninhabitants per community radio can be observed; the South approaches the \nUS ratio, despite a rather limited number of cities, often crucial to sustain a \ncommunity radio in Europe.   \n \nThe South-Belgian (and French) policies appear to be rather successful at \npromoting a thriving non-commercial community radio sector, stimulating \ninnovative radio projects, and promoting the relationships between community \nradio stations, the public broadcaster and the broader civil society. Project-\nbased funding and embedding state support in a public service logic, can be \nviewed as way to support community media initiatives without making them \ncompletely financially dependent on the state nor prone to co-optation by the \nmarket. It has to be noted though that a system of cross-subsidies from the \npublic broadcasters\u2019 advertisement revenues towards a fund to stimulate \ncommunity media is not applicable in every country. However, would it be \ntotally inconceivable to reserve a limited proportion of the advertisement \nrevenues of commercial broadcasters and\/or of license fees, when applicable, \nto stimulate creative media diversity on the airwaves?  \n \nFrom a theoretical perspective two observations become apparent. Despite \ndistinct regulatory histories, and the enactment of enabling and restricting \npolicies for community radio in the West, such initiatives remain persistent, \neven in the most dire of circumstances. They express the desire of activists, \ncommunities, artists to express themselves and resist the \u2013 often restrictive \u2013 \nregulatory context. This is to a large extent made possible by the rhizomatic \nnature of many participatory media initiatives, by their inter-connections with \nbroader civil society, at times with the state and even with the market in terms \nof generating funds to sustain their often fragile operations. At the same time \nthis also confuses their identity, can potentially lead to co-option, which in turn \nmakes it difficult for regulators to determine which kind of radio can be \nconsidered \u2018community\u2019 media and which not. Hence, the earlier plea for a \nfairly strict definition of community media in the West.  \n 17 \n \nFinally, this historical and comparative study also exposes that the theoretical \nmodels and typologies to compare media systems and regulatory regimes are \nflawed to some extent. Although the differences between the liberal model \nand the public service model certainly had an impact on community radio (US \nvs. Europe), current regulatory models and typologies do not properly reflect \non or accommodate for the historical struggle of participatory radio. Nor do \nthese models and typologies fully recognize the valuable democratic role that \ncommunity radio plays. By facilitating citizen participation in the media they \npromote civic cultures and through their role as critical watchdogs and as a \nplatform for marginalised and dissident voices, they promote (external and \ninternal) media pluralism. In this light and in line with the South-Belgian model, \nit might even be fruitful to start considering community radio as fulfilling a \npublic service, as an alternative form of independent public radio.  \n \nIndeed, the public\u2019s radio can and should take care of itself, but it needs a \ncreativity-enabling regulatory environment to be able to do this and sustain \nitself.  \n \n 18 \nReferences: \n \nAnderson, B.

This does not imply, however, that no \ncommercial activities are undertaken. Whilst most community radios are partly supported by \nthose participating, as well as the audience in some cases, and in some countries by grants \nfrom the government or sponsorship deals, these funds are rarely enough to sustain a 24 \nhour radio station. Thus, for most community stations it is paramount to organise additional \nactivities that generate funds in order to break even, pay license fees, electricity and invest in \nnew equipment.  \n4 In 1927 the Radio Act was voted by Congress aiming to end the perceived chaos on the \nairwaves. The act established the Federal Radio Commission, which was given the task of \nissuing licences. The FRC was replaced by the FCC in 1934.

Radio Caroline survived, moving its operations to \nthe Netherlands but still aiming its broadcast output at UK listeners.  It was joined by various \nothers, including Radio North Sea International, and Lazer Radio in a broadcasting \nphenomenon which lasted until 1990 when Radio Caroline finally ceased broadcasting from \ninternational waters (although the station remains active via satellite and the Internet up to the \npresent day). \n11 In 1997 the Community Radio Association changed its name to Community Media \nAssociation to accommodate community television initiatives: http:\/\/www.commedia.org.uk\/ \n(Last consulted 2 June 2008) \n12 See URL: http:\/\/www.dfmpromotions.com\/radio\/ (Last consulted 2 June 2008) \n13 Email Lawrie Hallett, 11 November 2008 \n14 See URL: http:\/\/www.soundradio.org.uk\/ (Last consulted 2 June 2008)  \n15 See URL: http:\/\/www.transmissionzero.co.uk\/radio\/london-pirate-radio\/ (Last consulted 2 \nJune 2008) \n16 Examples of this were the Mi Amigo, the Magdalena and the Jeanine, ships from which \nprogrammes produced in Belgium, the Netherlands, the UK and even Spain, were \nbroadcasted; they played mostly hit parade music introduced by popular DJs. \n17 Strangely enough the monopoly on TV broadcasting was lifted 15 years earlier, in 1987. \n18 see URL: http:\/\/www.radiocentraal.be\/ (Last consulted 2 June 2008) \n19 In French, the notion community radio is commonly used, instead such radio stations are \ncalled \u2018des radios associatives\u2019 or \u2018des radios culturelles\u2019. \n"}
