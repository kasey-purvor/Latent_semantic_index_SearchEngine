As an increasing number of people living with HIV and AIDS in Kenya have access to ART, the primary caregivers of poor resource settings, often children, face the challenge of meeting the requirements of rigid ART adherence schedules and frequent relapses. This, and the long-term duty of care, has an impact on the primary caregiver's experience of this highly stigmatised illness \u2013 an impact that is often described in relation to psychological deprivation. Reflecting the meanings attached to caregiving by 48 children in Western Kenya, articulated in writing, through photography and drawing, individual and group interviews, this paper presents three case studies of young caregiving.

If I am left alone, I will be able to do the\nduties. I become strong; I don't become a weak child.\"\nJoyce, age 12\nIn a globalised world, the management and support of\npeople living with AIDS is an issue that concerns us all [1].\nWith our growing understanding of HIV and AIDS and\nimproved access to antiretroviral therapy (ART), the AIDS\nepidemic is amenable to intervention and treatment man-\nagement, changing its course to mirror the disease proc-\nesses of other chronic illnesses [2]. According to Thorne\n[3] chronic illnesses are long term, and require careful\nmanagement and adjustment by the patients and their\ncaregivers as the person with the disease may fluctuate\nbetween chronic and acute episodes. People living with\nHIV\/AIDS also require careful management to sustain\nPublished: 23 August 2009\nGlobalization and Health 2009, 5:8 doi:10.1186\/1744-8603-5-8\nReceived: 4 December 2008\nAccepted: 23 August 2009\nThis article is available from: http:\/\/www.globalizationandhealth.com\/content\/5\/1\/8\n\u00a9 2009 Skovdal and Ogutu; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Page 1 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nGlobalization and Health 2009, 5:8 http:\/\/www.globalizationandhealth.com\/content\/5\/1\/8their health. This is particularly the case of those on ART\nwhose diet, adherence to rigid treatment plans and psy-\nchosocial well-being has to be managed, a responsibility\nthat is often shared with their primary caregiver.\nAlthough ART coverage in sub-Saharan Africa increased by\n33% in 2007, with 2.1 million people receiving ART [4],\nresulting in a decline of HIV\/AIDS related mortality [5],\nnumerous external factors impact on the success of ART,\nparticularly in rural Africa [6]. It is therefore important to\nunderstand the action and decision processes that impact\non ART adherence [7] and home-based care of people\nwith HIV\/AIDS [8]. Poor infrastructure and opportunity\ncosts have meant that many people still go without life-\nimproving medicines [9] and many of those who receive\nART are unable to adequately adhere to the strict treat-\nment plans [10,11]. A study in Tanzania reveals that fear\nof stigma and discrimination, additional costs of trans-\nportation, and supplementary food and negative associa-\ntions with hospital staff, have deterred HIV infected\npeople from following up on referrals for ART [12]. Non-\nadherence can result in relapses and drug resistance, and\nrecent findings from Malawi suggest that poor compliance\nto ART can even result in increased mortality [13].\nThese difficulties highlight the importance of understand-\ning the implications for long-term care of people living\nwith AIDS. Primary caregivers are at the forefront, strug-\ngling with rigid ART adherence schedules and frequent\nrelapses. Nevertheless, primary caregivers continue to play\na crucial role in facilitating the adherence of treatment\nplans and the provision of economic, nursing and moral\nsupport [8,14]. Perhaps unsurprisingly, family caregiving\nis often perceived to be a burden on the caregivers and\nthey are increasingly reported to be at risk of poor health\nand deprived psychosocial well-being [15,16]. The major-\nity of research on informal caregivers of people living with\nAIDS is focused on women [8,17], however, growing\nattention is being given to young caregivers. In this article\nwe use the term 'young carers' to refer to children under\nthe age of 18 who provide nursing care and support for\nsick, disabled or elderly relatives or guardians affected by\nAIDS on a regular basis and play a key role in sustaining\nthe household.\nResearch on young carers in Africa is still in its early stages\nand has so far been limited to the context of AIDS. Elsbeth\nRobson and colleagues have been in the forefront, identi-\nfying the circumstances that characterise young caregiving\nin Africa. They have explored their caring arrangements\n[18], their duties and responsibilities and how this nega-\ntively impact on their school attendance [19], the socioe-\nconomic and structural influences that induce young\ncaregiving in Africa [20,21] as well as the ethical implica-\ntions of doing research with young carers [22].\nRobson and colleagues have been cautious not to export\nwestern conceptualisations of young caregiving to the\nAfrican context [18], and have highlighted the reported\nbenefits of young caregiving [19]. Evans and Becker [23]\nin their recent comparative study of children caring for\nparents with HIV and AIDS in Tanzania and UK,\napproached children as social actors and usefully identi-\nfied some of the social determinants that facilitate the\nresilience of caregiving children. Nevertheless, the needs\nand vulnerabilities that do characterise young carers,\ntogether with a predominant focus on the ill-effects of car-\negiving in the international literature on young carers\n[24,25], and emerging trends on exploring the psycholog-\nical distress of children affected by AIDS [26-33], has\nencouraged a focus on the psychological well-being of\nyoung carers, usually starting with the assumption that\ncaring is inherently a source of mental ill-health for young\npeople.\nAs with their adult counterparts, children who provide\ncare and have domestic responsibilities have been associ-\nated with fragile mental health [16,22,34-39]. In a com-\nparative study between Zimbabwe and the United States,\nBauman and colleagues [34,35] interviewed a total of 100\nill mothers living with HIV and AIDS and one of their chil-\ndren. By choosing to use depression scales, the study\nbegins with the assumption that caring for an ill parent is\nan inherently traumatic experience that automatically\nputs children at risk of mental health problems. While this\nundoubtedly is true in some cases, we believe that this\nassumption reflects a Western mental health discourse\nand dominant representations of childhood as a period of\ninnocence and mental fragility in the absence of adult\nprotection.\nAlthough a debate on the psychosocial well-being of\nyoung carers is imperative, we believe a different approach\nis required to provide meaningful psychosocial support to\nyoung carers. This approach can lead to a more profound\nunderstanding and knowledge of coping and well-being\nand provide us with a good starting point for moving\ntoward better health. Such an approach has been usefully\ntheorised by Antonovsky [40] who, through his theories\nof salutogenesis (latin for the origins of health) and 'sense\nof coherence', argues that the meanings given by people in\ndifficult circumstances to their life situations shapes their\nsense of coherence, which then impacts on how they cope\nwith their circumstances [40,41]. In taking a salutogenic\napproach we are not seeking to develop specialised tech-\nniques or suggestions about how outside professionals\ncan cure the stress and hardship faced by young carers\nthrough expert techniques such as psychotherapy. Rather,\nwe seek to report on existing indigenous life strategies \u2013\ndeveloped by young carers themselves within their imme-\ndiate communities \u2013 that facilitate the sense of coherencePage 2 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nGlobalization and Health 2009, 5:8 http:\/\/www.globalizationandhealth.com\/content\/5\/1\/8they construct for their lives and promote their movement\ntoward coping and well-being. Meanings ascribed to\nstressful life events have previously shown to be critical in\ncoping and promoting psychosocial well-being [42,43].\nIn line with Antonovsky's salutogenic approach and to\nbroaden our understandings of the psychosocial well-\nbeing of young caregiving, this paper presents some of the\ncharacteristics that exemplify the circumstances of young\ncaregivers, including the social resources available to\nthem, and the meanings that they attach to caring. In\ndoing so, the paper aims to outline their negotiation with\nlocal understandings of childhood as a time of duty and\nservice through their cognitive ability to attach a meaning\nto their caring experiences and construct a positive iden-\ntity around these meanings.\nWe began this paper by quoting a 12-year-old girl who\nspoke of her caring role as a source of strength, even hap-\npiness. This counterintuitive claim calls for an under-\nstanding of the psychosocial nature of the demands of\nchild caregiving. In this paper we therefore seek to explore\nthe psychosocial well-being of children providing care for\npeople chronically ill from AIDS, suggesting that the psy-\nchosocial well-being of young carers is best promoted\nwith a nuanced understanding of the circumstances that\nsurround young caregiving.\nMethodology\nThis paper reports on the first phase of a two-year action\nresearch project with young caregivers in Western Kenya.\nThis qualitative study was granted clearance from the LSE\nethics committee and the Department for Gender and\nSocial Services in Kenya.\nSetting\nThe project is located in Bondo district along the shores of\nLake Victoria. Poverty is a major challenge for people in\nBondo district. With 68.1% of the 261,000 people living\nin the district living in absolute poverty, Bondo is one of\nthe poorest districts in Kenya [44]. Bondo also has one of\nthe highest HIV prevalence rates in Kenya. Estimates from\nthe 2002 district development plan [45] put the HIV prev-\nalence rate in Bondo at 30% while a more recent and con-\nservative figure estimates it to be 13.7%, still double the\nnational average [46]. Until 1999, the Bondo area was\npart of the Bondo-Siaya district. Throughout the early\nstages of the HIV and AIDS epidemic, it was marginalised\ndue to the poor reach of health services that concentrated\nin the Siaya area, presumably contributing to its excep-\ntionally high HIV prevalence rates. Another explanation\nfor high HIV prevalence rates is found in its geographical\nlocation. Bordering Lake Victoria, the fishing villages pro-\nvide employment for fishermen and truck drivers from all\nover Kenya whose migration and constant movement\nhave contributed to the spread of HIV and AIDS. Numer-\nous international NGOs have since been established in\nthe Bondo area in an effort to halt the spread of AIDS and\nseeking to promote home based care and orphan care and\nsupport. With ARVs freely available in Kenya, an increas-\ning number of people have commenced antiretroviral\ntherapy. Currently, an estimated 40% of those infected\nwith HIV and AIDS in Kenya receive ART [4,47]. Whilst\nthis positive development also holds true in Bondo, the\nopportunity costs and poverty characterising the district\nundermine the effectiveness of ART. A combination of the\ndistance and costs of travelling to the nearest ARV health\nfacility, stigma, and an inadequate diet all contribute to\nfrequent relapses and the continued need for care.\nRelapses, and the fact that 60% of people living with HIV\nand AIDS are still without ART [4] mean that many chil-\ndren in Bondo district have had their lives affected by\nAIDS, often providing chronic care and support to those\naffected by the disease. The two participating rural com-\nmunities in Bondo district are situated in areas character-\nised by high HIV prevalence rates and research from a\nneighbouring division suggests that one out of three chil-\ndren below 18 years of age have lost at least one biological\nparent, and one out of nine have lost both biological par-\nents [48]. Although Kenya has a relatively low national\nHIV and AIDS prevalence rate (6.7%) compared to other\nSouthern African countries, we believe Bondo district is\nrepresentative of many rural areas in some of the hardest\nhit countries in sub-Saharan Africa.\nData collection and Analysis\nIn this paper we present three case studies in order to map\nout the types of experiences reported by children, and to\nlocate them on what we will call a 'continuum of coping'.\nThese case studies represent the end point of a lengthy and\nstage-wise process of data collection and analysis that we\nwill outline in this section.\nOur data collection involved photography, individual and\ngroup interviews involving 48 young caregivers aged 11 to\n17. Approaching the children as experts on their own lives\n[49], multiple methods were used to gather the data to\nensure all children had an opportunity to communicate\nabout their experiences in a way that felt comfortable [50].\nAdapting the photovoice methodology and process devel-\noped by Wang and colleagues [51-53], the generation of\nphotovoice data involved four stages. The first stage was\nthat of photo-taking. Over a two-week period children\ntook photos guided by the following four questions: 1)\n'What is your life like?', 2) 'What is good about your life?',\n3) 'What makes you strong?' and 4) 'What needs to\nchange?' The second stage involved getting children to\nchoose six of their favourite photographs, encouraged to\nidentify a mix of photos showing how they get by, things\nthey lack and\/or something that is important to them. InPage 3 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nGlobalization and Health 2009, 5:8 http:\/\/www.globalizationandhealth.com\/content\/5\/1\/8the third stage, the children reflected on their chosen pho-\ntographs and wrote down their thoughts prompted by the\nfollowing questions: 1) 'I want to share this photo\nbecause...', 2) 'What's the real story this photo tells?', and\n3) 'How does this story relate to your life and\/or the lives\nof people in your neighbourhood?' If the children wanted\nto share a story that they were unable to capture on cam-\nera (e.g. for ethical or practical reasons), they were encour-\naged to draw the situation. This exercise generated a total\nof 184 photos and 56 drawings, each accompanied by a\nwritten reflection\/story. To further explore the findings\ngenerated from their written reflections, 24 individual\ninterviews and two group discussions were conducted\nwith the children.\nThis paper is part of a much wider study, which yielded,\namongst other things, a 6 theme analysis of key themes\nstructuring children's accounts of their experience: 1)\ndynamics and characteristics of luo society; 2) characteris-\ntics and perceptions of caring children in Western Kenya;\n3) determinants of caring experiences; 4) social resources;\n5) action-based coping and 6) psychology-based coping\n[cf. [54]]. These themes cut across individual accounts and\nreflect general representational resources identified across\nthe 48 research participants. In this particular paper we\nfocus on three individual life stories, presenting the stories\nof three children in ways that highlight the different ways\nin which children used these representational resources to\ngive meaning to their lives, and how different life experi-\nences\/access to resources and supportled to varyingly pos-\nitive, negative or mixed evaluations of their caring\nexperiences (see Figure 1).\nWe have also taken the liberty of abridging some of the\nmore detailed narratives into poems, which summarise\nthe content of their accounts of their lives in a way that\ntranscends the narrative chronology whilst bringing for-\nward their meanings, using the children's own words\n[55,56].\nFindings\nAll children managed their caring responsibilities and\ncoped despite adverse circumstances. However, different\nmeanings attached to caring suggest that the psychosocial\ncost of caregiving should be viewed on a continuum of\ncoping. As diagram 1 indicates, most of the children sur-\nrender to the circumstances prescribed to them and 'get\non' with the challenge of providing care. They may attach\nboth positive and negative meanings to their experiences\ndepending on the context and circumstances. However, a\nminority of children saw caring either as a relief, some-\nthing valuable they would not be without, or as some-\nthing which has caused damage to their life. Through the\ncase studies of Samuel, Carolyne and Pascal (pseudonyms\nhave been used to protect the identity of the children) we\npresent three different scenarios of life as a young car-\negiver and how these circumstances may contribute to the\nmeanings they attach to their circumstances.\nThe meanings that young carers attach to their circum-\nstances are influenced by the social environment. In par-\nticular local understandings of childhood were found to\nimpact their sense of coherence. Carolyne, during an\ninterview, explained that \"the duty of a child is to help\nparents. A child is called a helper.\" Concurrent to the local\nperception of childhood as a time of duty and service is a\nsometimes conflicting understanding of childhood,\nwhich is more rights-based and stresses the importance of\neducation. It is common for children and adults in Bondo\nto draw on both representations of childhood, depending\non the context, and they should therefore not be seen as\nbinary, but located on a dynamic continuum. Neverthe-\nless, as the case studies will illustrate, it is against these\nunderstandings of childhood that young carers give mean-\ning to their circumstances as they manage their caregiving,\nhead-of-household duties and education.\nSamuel, age 13 (positive meaning)\nSamuel was 9 years old when he first realised that his\nfather was ill. He noticed his father's swollen hands and\njoints and explained this in terms of a spell having been\ncast on his father by someone who was jealous of his job.\nSoon after, \"another spell was cast by another person on\nhis legs\" and he was bedridden. Although he was taken for\nprayers, his condition never changed. He had sores all\nDiagram of Meanings attached to caringFigure 1\nDiagram of Meanings attached to caring.Page 4 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nGlobalization and Health 2009, 5:8 http:\/\/www.globalizationandhealth.com\/content\/5\/1\/8over the body and Samuel applied creams to his body,\nwashed him, gave him drugs, prepared food and spoon-\nfed him. Although his mother was around to help, she too\ngot sick and was able to offer less and less support. Sam-\nuel's father died in 2005 when Samuel was 11 years old\nand he currently cares for his mother. Samuel is not caring\nfor his mother alone. His little sister also helps by fetching\nfirewood and water, and assists Samuel where ever she\ncan. Samuel also has a supportive extended family net-\nwork. His aunt has moved in to help them out. Aware of\nthis support, Samuel's assessment of his situation allows\nhim to reflect further on local understandings of child-\nhood as a time of duty and service and his perceived iden-\ntity and role as a young carer. These reflections led him to\nmove in with his ageing neighbour who had been\ndeserted by his family: \"I went and lived with him, help-\ning him out, cooked for him, fetched water, took care of\nthe poultry and ensured he was clean.\" Rather than con-\ncentrating on the care of his mother, Samuel's decision to\nmove in with his ageing neighbour not only reflects his\ncommitment to be a young carer but also his assessment\nof his circumstances as low risk.\nSamuel has always played an important role in sustaining\nthe households in which he has lived, drawing on the\nresources available to him through his parents. He culti-\nvates land with sorghum, some of which he sells to buy\nbasic amenities or chicken or goats. \"Chicken help me in\nproviding eggs, meat and gives us money if we sell them\n[...] at times I sell a chicken to get school fees\". Samuel's\nfamily also has a cow whose milk can pay for his school\nuniform and which can be slaughtered for a funeral. The\nresources available to Samuel, combined with his active\nparticipation, allows Samuel to cope. From a psychosocial\nperspective, the availability of social resources and sup-\nport makes it easier for Samuel to actively identify himself\nwith childhood as a period of duty and service, success-\nfully exceeding local expectations of childhood and from\nthat create a positive caring identity. This positive identity\ncame out strongly in his narratives. Summarising his nar-\nratives, the poem below indicates that both his religious\nfaith and his mobilisation of local understandings of\nchildhood have enabled Samuel to create a positive car-\negiver identity, based on the acceptance, love and bless-\nings he gets in return for his caring, both from the\ncommunity and God. Samuel therefore sees caregiving as\na strategy through which he derives recognition and sup-\nport from the community. In addition, Samuel distin-\nguishes himself from other children, arguing that \"if I\nhave something I can share it with other children, I don't\ndeny them.\" Samuel values this quality highly and\nattributes this good quality to his caregiving experiences.\nHe believes that many other children \"don't share what\nthey have with others, they pretend not to have anything.\"\nThe poem summarises and links the positive meanings\nthat Samuel attaches to caregiving and the construction of\na positive caregiving identity, one that influences Samuels\npsychosocial well-being and coping.\nI HAVE A HELPING HEART\nHow are you different?\nI like helping people.\nI have a helping heart,\nif I have something I share it\nWhat makes you happy?\nAll that I have done makes me happy\nthe villagers love me seriously\nas I don't do bad things in the community\nHow is life as a carer?\nIf I care for a sick person,\nI'm happy since I get blessings from God\nIt is not good for one to suffer.\nThere are no negative effects\nCarolyne, age 15 (mixed meanings)\nCarolyne's father died of an illness when she was 7 years\nold and she began taking care of her mother at the age of\n10. For two years Carolyne provided nursing care and psy-\nchosocial support to her mother and kept the household\nrunning. She cooked and fed her, washed and massaged\nher body. In addition to the nursing care, \"I also did the\nother house work such as cleaning the house, washing\nutensils and fetching water\". The workload was heavy and\ninterrupted with a change when her mother was admitted\nto the hospital. In the absence of adequate nursing care at\nthe hospital, Carolyne continued to care for her mother in\nthe hospital, forcing her to leave school. Carolyne's\nmother died in the hospital. During this time, she was\nlargely coping by herself \u2013 possibly as a result of the\nstigma associated with AIDS. But her caring experiences\ndo not end here.\nCarolyne and her little sister then moved in with her\ngrandmother who was very old and required care and sup-\nport. All her children had died and she was dependent on\nher grandchildren. Despite taking on significant caring\nand household chores, Carolyne was determined to returnPage 5 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nGlobalization and Health 2009, 5:8 http:\/\/www.globalizationandhealth.com\/content\/5\/1\/8to school. But soon after re-entering, her class teacher\nadvised her to leave school as she was not attending\nclasses consistently due to her responsibilities at home. In\naddition to her poor attendance, Carolyne suffered from\nslight visual impairment and had difficulties reading what\nwas written on the blackboard. Determined to stay in\nschool, Carolyne refused to drop out and continued with\nher education. Whilst dealing with her personal health\nissues and education, Carolyne also lost the support of her\nlittle sister: \"My sister was sponsored [to go to school] by\nsome whites and she is now in Nakuru\". Aside from her\nsister, Carolyne does not mention receiving support in her\nprovision of care from anyone else. This is also reflected\nby the amount of time she reported to spend on caring,\n\"you work throughout the day, no time for resting\". She\ndid however occasionally negotiate her way to material or\nfood support from community members. In describing a\nphoto of a woman who has supported her, she says\". This\nphoto reminds me of the kind of support and love we get\nfrom the community members. If I need anything, I tell\nthem and if it is available, I will get it\".\nAfter two years of caring, Carolyne's grandmother passed\naway. She was left to stay with her grandfather who was\nmistreating her, often leaving her to spend nights outside\nwhere she describes her encounters with hyenas. Carolyne\nquickly moved in with her aunt, who has been supporting\nher well since, \"If I ask my aunt to buy me something she\nwill not ignore me, even though I am not her child. No,\nshe will do for me the same as for her own children\". Car-\nolyne and her aunt jointly provide care for her aunt's eld-\nerly co-wife.\nLike Samuel, the numerous caring experiences that have\nconfronted Carolyne have facilitated a caring identity.\nUnlike Samuel, her identity is a more reflective one,\nacknowledging both the negative and positive impact of\ncaregiving. Although she is now in foster care with her\naunt (whom she calls mother), she continues to provide\ncare and support for the sick and old in her community,\nthis time with help from her aunt. Although Carolyne says\nthat \"the lives of children caring for the sick is not good\",\nshe describes her circumstances and work as something\nshe just had to do, without complaints, and something\nwhich is important. Carolyne's experience highlights both\nthe difficulties she has faced in providing care, as well as\nthe way she has dealt with them. Aside from the periodic\nsupport she has received from her sister and aunt, her\nsocial environment has been of limited support, yet she\naccepted her role as carer and simply 'got on' with the job.\nAs the poem summarising Carolyne's accounts demon-\nstrate, Carolyne has mixed feelings toward her circum-\nstances, acknowledging both the negative and positive\nimpact caregiving has on her, consciously accepting her\ncircumstances.\nAll that I have done has been important\nI was first caring for my mother\nwhen she was sick.\nShe was too sick to do anything.\nI was the one to wash her and feed her.\nIt reached a point where I could not sleep.\nShe was crying of pain all the time.\nShe needed water and wanted to be massaged.\nI also did the housework.\nCleaned the house, fetched water and prepared food.\nI had to leave school.\nAfter her death my grandmother fell sick.\nI started caring for her.\nWe had no money, I could not take her to the hospital\nI have had problems.\nI have been committed to caring and had little rest.\nBut all that I have done has been important.\nPascal, age 14 (negative meaning)\nPascal began providing care from a very young age. Until\nhis seventh birthday, Pascal was taking care of his father\nwho suffered from AIDS. Pascal did not receive much sup-\nport from his mother, who eventually left the house\nbecause of stigma, leaving 6-year-old Pascal alone with his\nfather. Pascal's older siblings lived away and only pro-\nvided limited support, mostly in terms of food. Pascal\nspoon fed his father and cleaned his body, also in the\nmost intimate of places. When Pascal tried to seek out\nhelp from his mother who was staying with her brothers,\nhe was chased away by his uncles. When asked about how\nhe coped with the situation, Pascal explained: \"I had a\nvegetable garden which I used to cultivate and sell the pro-\nduce from in order to buy drugs for my father or anything\nelse he needed\". At the age of seven, Pascal's father died.\nFollowing his father's death, Pascal moved in with one of\nhis brothers and returned to school. To Pascal's dismay,Page 6 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nGlobalization and Health 2009, 5:8 http:\/\/www.globalizationandhealth.com\/content\/5\/1\/8he was told by his teacher that he had to repeat class 2.\nPascal had a difficult year: \"It was painful to see my class-\nmates in class 3. I did not forget the caring of my father for\nthe whole first term and I could only think about how my\nfather died. This thinking left me at the bottom of my\nclass. But in term 2 I started to forget these things slowly\".\nAs with Pascal, many young carers attach a feeling of loss\nor damage to their education as a result of time consum-\ning caregiving or a lack of concentration.\nPascal's caring experiences did not end here. A couple of\nyears later his brother also got ill, but this time Pascal was\nnot alone in caring: \"Fortunately we were two of us, so one\ncared at night and another during the day. I especially\ncared during the night and it made me unable to concen-\ntrate as I almost slept in class\". As his brother got bedrid-\nden, Pascal left school once again and had to repeat class\nfour when his brother died. Following the death of his\nbrother, Pascal moved in with his grandmother where he\ncurrently stays. He supports his grandmother with those\ntasks she cannot perform due to old age and is reviving his\nrelationship with his mother, who decided to return to the\ncommunity two years after his father's death. In reflecting\non the limited support he received during his caregiving,\nwhich was a key contributor to the negative meanings he\nattach his experiences, Pascal laid heavy emphasis on the\nrelative poverty that he endured: \"Other children have\ntheir school fees paid for by their parents, they have good\nclothes, good shoes and they look nice whilst I cannot\nafford to look nice because of the little money I have\". In\ncomparing his life with other children, Pascal clearly sees\nhimself as a victim and feels the injustice surrounding his\ncircumstances. Despite these victimological representa-\ntions, Pascal has not lost hope: \"I know and hope that my\nlife will be good\".\nThe poem summarising Pascal's experience exemplifies\nthe very difficult conditions in which Pascal was provid-\ning care. It is evident from Pascal's narratives that he feels\na tremendous sense of loss and damage to his life, circum-\nstances that have pushed Pascal to feel a sense of relief fol-\nlowing the death of his father.\nAll this suffering\nThis drawing (see figure 2) shows the kind of care I\nhave given to the sick\nMy mother was nowhere to be found\nMy father's sickness got worse and worse\nIt forced me to leave school\nHe was unable to walk\nI washed off his faeces\nHe disturbed me during the night\nI was very sad, I was left alone with my father\nWhen he died, I thanked God, he made me suffer a lot\nOne of my brothers fell sick, this also made me leave\nschool\nI had to repeat class four when my brother died\nAll this suffering made me go to my grandmother's\nplace\nI am now in class 7 and learning\nI help my grandmother with harvesting,\nfetching water and cooking\nIt shows good behaviour and the majority loves me.\nI am still not happy with the kind of life I am living,\nthough I am in school\nDiscussion\nOur three case studies highlight the duties involved with\nchronic care of adults affected by HIV\/AIDS. In the\nabsence of working adults in their households, many of\nthe children were responsible for the generation of food\nand income to sustain their household. Alongside these\nresponsibilities, children showed great concern for the\ncare and well-being of their sick parents or ageing grand-\nparents, taking on considerable nursing duties. Children\nare often the primary caregivers for their ailing parents\nand play a fundamental role in the management of their\nparent's disease and opportunistic infections. Approach-\ning young carers as social actors, the case studies illustrate\nhow young carers cope with the care of guardians who suf-\nfered from chronic conditions. We have highlighted the\nsocial resources and protective factors potentially availa-\nble to them (or not) and how these social resources may\ncontribute to the way in which they assess their risk and\nvulnerabilities.\nSamuel received support from his aunt and little sister and\nused his faith and local representations of childhood to\nconstruct a positive identity as a young caregiver. Samuel\nsuggests he is loved by the community because he pro-\nvides care and support, a reflection of the local expecta-\ntion of childhood as a period of duty and service.\nCarolyne, on the other hand, did recognise the disadvan-Page 7 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nGlobalization and Health 2009, 5:8 http:\/\/www.globalizationandhealth.com\/content\/5\/1\/8tages and the problems she was facing, but also managed\nto attach some positive meanings to her experiences. She\nsurrendered to her circumstances and got on with caring,\napproaching caregiving as a challenge, something diffi-\ncult, but something which was important. Although Car-\nolyne sees caregiving overall as positive, there were other\nchildren, able to reflect on a mix of positive and negative\nmeanings, who perceived caregiving as an overall negative\nthing. This was often upon reflection on the impact car-\negiving has had on their education. We found only a few\nchildren with completely ambivalent meanings. Pascal\nwas much less optimistic about his circumstances, reflect-\ning on his particular situation and lack of social support.\nPascal was further influenced by representations of the\nimportance of education, and as caring compromised his\neducation in certain periods, he felt a sense of loss and\ndamage to his chances in life. As is evident from the case\nstudies, their specific circumstances, social resources and\nrepresentations impact on the meanings which the chil-\ndren attached to caring. This in turn contributes to their\npsychosocial well-being, a relationship (between ascribed\nmeaning and well-being\/coping) that has been docu-\nmented in the context of physical illnesses [42,57,58].\nMost of the children involved in the wider study attached\na variety of meanings to caregiving and many were still\nnegotiating the different meanings they attached to vari-\nous contexts. These mixed meanings were often a reflec-\ntion of the paradoxical expectations of children. On one\nhand the children draw on local understandings of child-\nhood as a time of duty and service, and on the other, chil-\ndren are told about the importance of attending school.\nAs young carers having to juggle with both duty and serv-\nice and education, the meanings they ascribe to their cir-\ncumstances are often a by-product of their negotiation\nbetween these expectations. Nevertheless, the negotiation\nof meanings that these children actively engage in facili-\ntates their psychosocial coping and connects them to dif-\nferent meanings at different times in order to achieve\nparticular goals.\nWhilst certain caregiving circumstances may well be detri-\nmental to a child's mental health, this is not always the\ncase. Counter balancing (or not) some of their vulnerabil-\nities were the symbolic and socioeconomic resources that\narose from their familial and social environments, allow-\ning many of the children to draw on some of the more\npositive aspects of caregiving. The ability of caregiving\nchildren to identify and draw on the benefits of their dif-\nficult circumstances has previously been identified as a\nstrategy for psychological survival [19]. The three case\nstudies presented in this paper also suggest that the chil-\ndren's previous experiences of caregiving and whom they\ncurrently care for is an important influence on the mean-\nDrawing by PascalFigure 2\nDrawing by Pascal.\n \n Page 8 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nGlobalization and Health 2009, 5:8 http:\/\/www.globalizationandhealth.com\/content\/5\/1\/8ings they attach. Carolyne for example, who has provided\ncare and support to a number of adults over a period of\ntime, is now used to caregiving and has a break from the\nemotional cost of caring for an ailing parent. Carolyne is\nable to reflect on the hard times she had, but also on the\nskills and social benefits caregiving has brought her. Car-\nolyne was not an exception. Many of the participating\nyoung carers have had numerous caregiving experiences\nand continue to provide care long after parental death, as\ntheir grandparents, who have lost children to AIDS, are in\nneed of care and support as they age. As exemplified by\nCarolyne, the majority of children, depending on the con-\ntext and time, approach and describe their circumstances\ndifferently, and effectively move around within the con-\ntinuum of psychosocial coping. Some children have\nactively constructed a positive caregiving identify, whilst\nothers see themselves as marginalised. These meanings\nand identities may change with time. These findings sug-\ngest that the vulnerability of young carers is a process [59],\none which requires a nuanced understanding of the pro-\ntective factors and social resources available for the chil-\ndren to actively draw [54].\nOne important finding is that the children are able to\nidentify numerous benefits to young caregiving and\nactively draw on these benefits to facilitate psychosocial\ncoping. We hope that our analysis has shown that to pro-\nvide appropriate support for young caregivers, health pro-\nfessionals must align their understanding and responses\nto the psychosocial cost of chronic care, to a more\nnuanced and contextual understanding of social agency\nand opportunities evident in African communities. Rather\nthan focusing on counselling services, interventions tar-\ngeting young carers should strengthen the existing social\nresources within their context and provide the communi-\nties with the financial and social psychological resources\nto do so.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nThe study was conceived and coordinated by MS.
