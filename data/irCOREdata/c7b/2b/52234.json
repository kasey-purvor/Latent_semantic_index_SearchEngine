Introduction 34 \nThe application of geophysical methods to landslide characterisation and monitoring has steadily 35 \nincreased in recent years because of improvements in ground imaging techniques (Jongmans and 36 \nGarambois, 2007). Crucially, geophysical methods have the potential to provide spatial or volumetric 37 \ninformation on subsurface structure and property variations. This is in contrast to mapping methods, 38 \nsuch as remote sensing or aerial photography that are limited to providing surface information, and 39 \nto intrusive methods, such as boreholes and penetration tests that provide subsurface data only at 40 \ndiscrete locations. Geophysical methods, however, have been most effectively applied when used in 41 \nconjunction with other surface and ground investigation techniques (e.g., Van Den Eeckhaut et al., 42 \n2007; Sass et al., 2008); this integrated approach is particularly important for geophysical 43 \ninvestigations that provide physical property information rather than direct geological or 44 \ngeotechnical data, and so require calibration. Seismic methods and ground penetrating radar (e.g., 45 \nSchrott and Sass, 2008) are now widely used, as are a range of geoelectrical methods, including 46 \nresistivity and self-potential (SP), which are the focus of this study. 47 \nGeoelectrical investigations of landslides are dominated by the use of two-dimensional (2D) 48 \nelectrical resistivity tomography (ERT), which is a rapid and lightweight means of acquiring spatial 49 \ninformation on ground structure and composition. Resistivity methods have proved to be successful 50 \nbecause of the sensitivity of resistivity to changes in lithology \u2212 principally related to electric 51 \nconduction on the surface of clay minerals \u2212 and moisture content (e.g., Telford et al., 1990; Shevnin 52 \net al., 2007); hence, these methods are being developed to investigate the structure of landslides in 53 \nterms of compositional variations, depth to bedrock, geological boundaries and slip plane geometry 54 \n(e.g., Drahor and Berge, 2006; Godio et al., 2006; Jomard et al., 2007b; Van Den Eeckhaut et al., 55 \n2007; Yilmaz, 2007; G\u00f6kt\u00fcrkler et al., 2008; Marescot et al., 2008; Sass et al., 2008;  Erginal et al., 56 \n2009; Schmutz et al., 2009), and also the associated hydrogeological regime (e.g., Grandjean et al., 57 \n2006; Jomard et al., 2007a; Lee et al., 2008; Niesner and Weidinger, 2008; Piegari et al., 2009). 58 \n4 \n \nSeveral of these studies detail the investigation of clayey landslides, and are therefore particularly 59 \nrelevant to this study. Examples include Lapenna et al. (2005) who described the use of 2D ERT to 60 \nsuccessfully characterise the extent and depth of Giarrossa and Varco d\u2019Izzo landslides, Italy, both of 61 \nwhich are rototranslational slide-earthflows. Lee et al. (2008) used ERT to contribute to the 62 \ndevelopment of lithological and hydrogeological models of the Lishan landslide, Taiwan, through 63 \nidentifying the subsurface structure associated with slipped clay rich colluviums overriding slate 64 \nbedrock. The ERT surveys described by Schmutz et al. (2009) were applied to the investigation of the 65 \nSuper Sauze landslide, France, which in its lower regions forms an earthflow. The study concludes 66 \nthat ERT was an effective means of imaging the internal structure of the landslide and discriminating 67 \nbetween different lithologies.  68 \nAlthough 2D ERT is now commonly used, three-dimensional (3D) ERT has rarely been applied despite 69 \nbeing a clearly more appropriate method. Landslides are inherently 3D structures, often displaying 70 \nvery significant spatial heterogeneity, and so in these cases 3D features to the side of 2D survey lines 71 \nwill cause significant artefacts and inaccuracies in 2D resistivity models (Chambers et al., 2002; 72 \nSjodahl et al., 2006). The dearth of examples of 3D ERT for landslide investigation is probably due to 73 \nthe greater complexity of survey design, field deployment, and data processing that is required 74 \nrelative to 2D imaging. One of the few studies described in the literature (Lebourg et al., 2005) used 75 \n3D ERT to characterise a section of the La Clapi\u00e8re landslide in the French Alps. The study was 76 \nconducted within an area of 70 x 90 m, and the resulting images were used to identify deep-seated 77 \nslip surfaces and related hydrogeological changes.   78 \nSelf-potential surveys involve the measurement of naturally occurring geoelectric fields that are 79 \ngenerated in the subsurface by a range of mechanisms (Telford et al., 1990). The use of SP in 80 \nhydrogeological studies is concerned primarily with electrokinetic effects, also referred to as 81 \nstreaming potentials, that are caused by the movement of fluid through porous rocks and soils (Revil 82 \net al., 1999). The simplest type of SP surveys to have been applied to landslide investigations are 83 \n5 \n \nprofiling (Bruno and Marillier, 2000) and mapping (Perrone et al., 2004) that have been used to 84 \nidentify zones of negative and positive charge, which correlate with the infiltration and accumulation 85 \nof water in the subsurface; the SP map produced by Perrone et al. (2004) was used to investigate 86 \nsubsurface fluid flow across the entire area of a clayey landslide with a length of 1400m and a width 87 \nof up to 420 m. Tomographic reconstruction of SP data is, however, beginning to be applied to image 88 \nsubsurface charge distributions related to the hydrogeological regime within clayey landslides in 2D 89 \n(Lapenna et al., 2003) and 3D (Colangelo et al., 2006). 90 \nIn this study we apply geoelectrical methods (including resistivity mapping, 2D and 3D ERT, and SP 91 \nprofiling, mapping and tomography) to the investigation of an active landslide in the Upper Lias, 92 \nWhitby Mudstone Formation. The Lias Group is Lower Jurassic in age and is composed primarily of 93 \nargillaceous sediments, including marine limestones, shales, marls, and clays. The Group extends 94 \nacross significant areas of western Europe, and in England and Wales it outcrops as a continuous 95 \nband from Dorset on the south coast to the North Yorkshire coast in the NE of England. Slopes 96 \ncomprising Lias Group rocks are particularly prone to failure, accounting for 15% of all landslides 97 \nrecorded in Britain (Jones and Lee, 1994). Landslides within Lias Group rocks have a wide 98 \ngeographical distribution, at both inland and coastal outcrop, with the most common types including 99 \nrotations, flows, and slides as well as cambering (Hobbs et al., 2005).  Within the UK, the greatest 100 \nconcentration of landslides are found in the Upper Lias sequence with up to 42 slides per 100 km2 101 \n(Hobbs et al., 2005). Despite their widespread occurrence, few, if any, studies describe the 102 \napplication of noninvasive geophysical techniques to investigate slope failure in Lias Group rocks.  103 \nThe landslide considered here was selected as a representative example typical of many landslides in 104 \nLias Group mudrocks whose characteristics often include (Hobbs et al., 2005): a substantial thickness 105 \nof weak weathered mudrock underlying a more competent unit (usually sandstone or limestone); a 106 \nrelatively low angle; shallow translational failures characterised by earth flows towards the toe and 107 \nrotations at the head. The primary aim of this work was to consider the efficacy of fully 3D 108 \n6 \n \ngeoelectrical approaches to landslide investigation, with particular reference to the geological 109 \ncontext of the Lias Group. Interpretation and calibration of the 3D geophysical site models was 110 \nsupported by aerial photography, geological mapping, aerial LIDAR scans, intrusive sampling, and 1D 111 \nand 2D geoelectrical surveys (i.e. SP profiling, resistivity and SP mapping, and 2D ERT). The improved 112 \nunderstanding of the geophysical anatomy of the landslide revealed by this study is intended to 113 \ninform the design of a permanent geophysical monitoring network at the site. 114 \n 115 \n2.  Study area 116 \nThe study area is located on the northeastern edge of Sheriff Hutton Carr, a broad topographic 117 \nembayment on the eastern margin of the Vale of York.  Sheriff Hutton Carr is bounded to the north 118 \nby the Lias Group escarpment and to the south by a semicontinuous ridge of Devensian till and 119 \noutlying Jurassic strata. Geological surveying of the York district (Ford, in press) proposed that 120 \noriginal drainage from this area was toward the SW. However, during the Devensian, an ice-marginal 121 \nlake (Lake Mowthorpe - see glaciolacustrine deposits on the western edge of geological map in Fig. 122 \n1) developed as meltwater from the NW and surface-water runoff from the escarpment was 123 \nconfined between the escarpment and the ice sheet to the south. A spill point was reached at the 124 \neastern edge of the lake, resulting in the rapid incision of a north-south aligned gorge and the 125 \nestablishment of the modern-day drainage system along Bulmer Beck. This steep-sided gorge is 126 \nflanked by the Whitby Mudstone Formation and is subject to multiple landslides (Fig. 1). Postglacial 127 \nlandslides may have periodically dammed off the gorge, resulting in the reestablishment of Lake 128 \nMowthorpe. 129 \nThe escarpment is underlain by a shallow marine mudstone-dominated succession of Lower Jurassic 130 \nage comprising, in ascending order, the Redcar Mudstone (RMF), Staithes Sandstone and Cleveland 131 \nIronstone (SSF), and Whitby Mudstone Formations (WMF). The last formation is the principal source 132 \n7 \n \nof slope failure at the site and in the surrounding area (Fig. 1). The escarpment is capped by the 133 \nDogger Formation of Middle Jurassic age; although thinly developed, this limestone- and sandstone-134 \ndominated unit represents a potential aquifer above the WMF and is a principal component of head 135 \ndeposits on the escarpment. The bedrock succession displays a regional dip of 1\u00b0 to 2\u00b0 to the north 136 \non the southern edge of the Cleveland Basin, although locally beds can dip by as much as 7\u00b0. The 137 \nRMF comprises grey, silty, calcareous, and sideritic mudstone with thin shelly limestones (Rawson 138 \nand Wright, 1995). The RMF is estimated to be up to 175 m thick, although only the upper 25 m are 139 \nexposed in the lower part of the escarpment. The formation is characterised by poorly drained clay 140 \nsoil. The upper boundary of the formation displays a gradational transition to the SSF. The SSF 141 \ncomprises ferruginous, micaceous siltstone with fine-grained sandstone and thin mudstone partings. 142 \nIt is heavily bioturbated and locally contains siderite and small pyrite masses (Gaunt et al., 1980). 143 \nThe formation is about 20 m thick and is associated with well-drained loam soil in the middle part of 144 \nthe escarpment. The upper boundary of the formation is marked by a transition to mudstone of the 145 \nWMF, which is composed of grey to dark grey mudstone and siltstone with scattered bands of 146 \ncalcareous and sideritic concretions. The WMF is ~ 25 m thick, with a sharp upper boundary marked 147 \nby the erosive base of the Dogger Formation. The formation is commonly deeply weathered and 148 \npoorly consolidated near to the ground surface, giving rise to poorly drained clay soil. The 149 \nescarpment is capped by the Dogger Formation, forming an extensive dipslope extending to the 150 \nnorth of the site. The formation is characterised by calcareous sandstone and ferruginous limestone 151 \nincluding rounded clasts of micritic limestone. The Dogger Formation occupies hollows in the angular 152 \nunconformity with the WMF and ranges considerably in thickness across the region to attain a local 153 \nmaximum of 8 m (to the north of the site). The Dogger Formation gives rise to free-draining sandy 154 \nsoil rich in gravel- to cobble-size rock fragments. In common with the surrounding area, the bedrock 155 \nsuccession at the escarpment is overlain by a thin layer of head. This deposit is characterised by 156 \ngravelly, sandy, silty clay with occasional organic inclusions, representing locally derived material, 157 \nreworked by a combination of near-surface processes including hillwash, slope failure, and soil 158 \n8 \n \ncreep. The thickness of head deposits is highly variable, ranging from 0.2 to 1.3 m, generally 159 \nincreasing toward the base of the escarpment. These thin and locally discontinuous head deposits 160 \nare not shown on Fig. 1.  161 \nThe landslide is a very slow to slow moving composite multiple earth slide\u2013earth flow, according to 162 \nthe classification scheme proposed by Cruden and Varnes (1996), with maximum rates of movement 163 \nobserved in recent years in the order of 2 m\/y. Movements were monitored by repeated Real Time 164 \nKinematic (RTK) GPS measurents of marker peg locations across the landslide over a period of two 165 \nyears. Maximum rates of movement occurred towards the fronts of the lobes. The principal 166 \nmovements have typically occurred during winter months when the slope is at its wettest. The 167 \nlandslide extends laterally along the escarpment for more than 1 km covering and area of 168 \napproximately 10 hectares, with much of it hidden by woodland. The section of the landslide 169 \ndescribed in this study is situated within a grassed area with a width of 250 m and a total length of ~ 170 \n180 m. A geomorphological map of the study area is shown in Fig. 2A, in which concave and convex 171 \nbreaks of slope have been mapped, with line work indicating whether the break in slope was 172 \nrounded or sharp. The map was created using a combination of stereophotogrammetry, analysis of 173 \naerial LiDAR data (see base layer in Fig. 2A), and line work generated from ground based RTK-GPS 174 \nmeasurements. The GPS survey was used, in particular, to capture those features with a sharp break 175 \nin slope, such as the main scarp, and fresh ruptures in the foot of the landslide. The upper sections 176 \nto the north are characterised by rotational slides with multiple minor scarps and cracking within the 177 \nWMF, which evolve into heavily fissured earth flows that form discrete lobes of slipped material 178 \noverriding the SSF bedrock to the south. Multiple stacked phases of earth flow activity associated 179 \nwith the lobes are apparent; toward the base of the slope stabilised and degraded earth flows are in 180 \nevidence, whilst the upper sections of the lobes are characterised by fresh ruptures from ongoing 181 \nearth flow development. 182 \n9 \n \nThe hydrology of the site is complex and not well constrained. The interface between the SSF and 183 \nthe less permeable RMF at the base of the slope (Fig. 2) defines a spring line that is active for most of 184 \nthe year. During wet periods, sag ponds develop within the backward-tilted section below the main 185 \nscarp (Fig. 2A) and water seeps from the fronts of the lobes toward the base of the slope. Intrusive 186 \ninvestigations (i.e. drilling and hand augering; Fig. 3) across the study area have revealed significant 187 \nheterogeneity and lithological variability in both the slipped and in-situ material. During augering 188 \nmultiple perched water levels and horizons on which seepages are occurring within the WMF and 189 \nSSF bedrock were observed in the slipped material within the lobes.   190 \n 191 \n3.  Methodology 192 \nInitial geoelectrical surveying across the site was undertaken using 2D ERT, SP profiling, and mobile 193 \nresistivity mapping. A section of the site was then selected for more detailed investigation using 3D 194 \nERT, SP mapping, and SPT surveys. This area extended from the back scarp to beyond the toe of the 195 \nlobes on the eastern side of the site and was selected as it was representative of the wider site, it 196 \ncovered the enter length of the slip, and it included some of the most active areas of the landslide.   197 \n3.1.  Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) 198 \nGeoelectrical imaging techniques such as ERT are now widely used for studying environmental and 199 \nengineering problems (Pellerin, 2002). Electrical resistivity tomography produces spatial or 200 \nvolumetric models of subsurface resistivity distributions, from which features of contrasting 201 \nresistivity may be located and characterised. Methodologies for 2D and 3D ERT data collection and 202 \nmodelling are described widely in the literature (e.g. Dahlin et al., 2002; Lapenna et al., 2005), so 203 \nonly a short summary is provided here.  204 \n10 \n \nDuring the course of an ERT survey, multiple electrical resistance measurements are made. In this 205 \ncase ERT data were collected using an AGI SuperSting R8 IP system attached to stainless steel 206 \nelectrodes via multicore cables. The locations of the four 2D ERT survey lines and the 3D ERT imaging 207 \narea are shown in Fig. 2B. Two-dimensional ERT data were collected on four north-south trending 208 \nsurvey lines, shown as lines 1, 2, 3, and 4 with lengths of 189, 477, 186, and 180 m, respectively. The 209 \nextended line 2 was deployed to capture the full geological succession in the area; its full extent is 210 \nnot shown in Fig. 2B. The 3D ERT data set was collected using a set of five survey lines within an area 211 \nof 38 x 147.25 m (Fig. 2B); lines were oriented parallel to the long axis of the survey area, with along-212 \nline electrode separations of 4.75 m and interline separations of 9.5 m. A dipole-dipole configuration 213 \nwas employed throughout the survey for both 2D and 3D surveys, with the exception of line 4, for 214 \nwhich a Wenner-type configuration was used. The 2D dipole-dipole lines (lines 1 to 3) were surveyed 215 \nusing dipole lengths (a) of 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 m and dipole separations (na) of 1a to 8a. For the 3D 216 \nsurvey, data were collected using dipole sizes of 4.75, 9.5, 14.25, and 19 m and n levels of 1 to 8. The 217 \ndipole-dipole array has many advantages: it is a well-tested array with good resolving capabilities 218 \n(Chambers et al., 2002; Dahlin and Zhou, 2004); it does not require the use of a remote electrode; it 219 \ncan efficiently exploit the multichannel capability of modern ERT instruments; and crucially, it 220 \nenables reciprocal measurements to be collected. In this case, full sets of reciprocal measurements 221 \nwere collected for both the 2D and 3D dipole-dipole surveys. Reciprocal measurements provide a 222 \nparticularly effective means of assessing data quality and determining robust and quantitative data 223 \nediting criteria (e.g. Dahlin and Zhou, 2004). For a normal four-electrode measurement of transfer 224 \nresistance (\u03c1n), the reciprocal (\u03c1r) is found by interchanging the current and potential dipoles. 225 \nReciprocal error |e| is defined here as the percentage standard error in the average measurement, 226 \n\uf028 \uf029rnrne \uf072\uf072\uf072\uf072 \uf02b\uf02d\uf0b4\uf03d \/100      (1) 227 \nFor lines 1, 2, and 3, for which reciprocal measurements were collected, 83, 95, and 93% of the 228 \nrespective data sets had errors of < 5%; whilst for the 3D dataset, 99.8% of the data had a reciprocal 229 \n11 \n \nerror of < 5%. Data points with a reciprocal error of > 5% were removed from the data sets, and the 230 \nreciprocal errors were used to weight the data during the inversion. 231 \nIn brief, the aim of the inversion process is to calculate a model that satisfies the observed data. A 232 \nstarting model is produced, which in these cases was a homogeneous half-space, for which a 233 \nresponse is calculated and compared to the measured data. The starting model is then modified in 234 \nsuch a way as to reduce the differences between the model response and the measured data; these 235 \ndifferences are quantified as a mean absolute misfit error value. This process continues iteratively 236 \nuntil acceptable convergence between the calculated and measured data is achieved, or until the 237 \nchange between error values calculated for consecutive iterations becomes insignificant. The 2D and 238 \n3D ERT field data were inverted using l1-norm implementations (Loke and Lane, 2002) of the 239 \nregularized least-squares optimization method (Loke and Barker, 1995, 1996). The forward problem 240 \nwas solved using the finite-element method, in which node positions were adjusted to allow 241 \ntopography to be taken into account in the inversion process (Loke, 2000). 242 \nIn general, a range of different models with identical responses could be obtained from the field 243 \ndata; this is due to its necessarily incomplete nature. The problem of nonuniqueness is exacerbated 244 \nwith increasing depth of investigation because the model in these regions is less well constrained by 245 \nthe data. The model that best satisfies the l1-norm smoothness criterion is therefore chosen, which 246 \nfavours sharp boundaries between regions of different resistivity. Despite this, the lack of 247 \ncompleteness in the data will cause the sharpness, position, and contrast of these boundaries to be 248 \nmore poorly resolved with increasing depth. Therefore, the ERT models can provide only an 249 \napproximate guide to the true resistivity and geometry of subsurface features (Olayinka and 250 \nYaramanci, 2000); and hence, calibration using intrusive sampling is highly desirable. 251 \n3.2.  Mobile resistivity mapping 252 \n12 \n \nMobile resistivity mapping was undertaken using the automated resistivity profiling (ARP) technique, 253 \nwhich uses a patented multielectrode device (Geocarta SA, France) in order to make direct current 254 \n(DC) measurements of subsurface electrical resistivity along profiles with the aim of producing 255 \nhorizontal property maps (Dabas and Favard, 2007; Dabas, 2009). Electrical mapping using DC 256 \nresistivity methods (e.g. Panissod et al., 1998; Kuras et al., 2007) has advantages over methodologies 257 \nbased on electromagnetic (EM) induction from smaller uncertainties in sensor calibration and 258 \ngreater control over the depth of investigation (Dabas and Tabbagh, 2003). In its basic form, ARP 259 \nmeasures the apparent resistivity (\u03c1a) for three different equatorial array configurations, each with a 260 \ngreater separation between current and potential dipoles than the last and, hence, with a greater 261 \nmeasurement volume and depth of investigation. The ARP electrodes are wheel-mounted and are 262 \nrolled along the surface where they are automatically inserted into the ground, acting as current and 263 \npotential dipoles. Apparent resistivity maps can provide information on the spatial variability of soil 264 \nproperties such as texture, clay content, moisture, stoniness, and depth to substratum (Samouelian 265 \net al., 2005). The ARP sensor array is pulled by an all-terrain vehicle, thus allowing apparent 266 \nresistivity data to be acquired simultaneously for three separate depth profiles (0-0.5, 0-1, and 0-2 m 267 \nbelow ground level). The use of real-time kinematic GPS navigation within the system enables on-268 \nsite navigation and the acquisition of spatially accurate data in real time. This survey method 269 \nprovides highly mobile and self-contained data acquisition over areas of ~ 40 ha d-1. Typical site 270 \ncoverage follows a grid of parallel survey lines in a bidirectional pattern, guided by on-board 271 \nnavigation. For this study however, the survey lines were necessarily less regular because of the 272 \ncomplex and steep terrain. Data processing involved the application of a 1D median filter along each 273 \ntransect, followed by a bicubic spline interpolation on a 2.5-m regular mesh. 274 \n3.3. Self potential (SP) profiling, mapping and tomography 275 \nThe causative mechanisms of SP anomalies include thermal, electrochemical, and electrokinetic 276 \nphenomena as well as voltages resulting from anthropogenic sources. Applications related to these 277 \n13 \n \nvarious mechanisms range from investigations of geothermal activity (e.g. Yasukawa et al., 2005), 278 \nwhere SP signatures generated by thermal and electrokinetic effects are observed, to mineral 279 \nprospecting (e.g. Heinson et al., 2005) and contaminated land studies (e.g. Minsley et al., 2007) 280 \nwhere electrochemical effects often dominate. With no obvious sources of cultural noise or 281 \nthermoelectric or electrochemical effects, the primary cause of SP at this site is likely to be 282 \nstreaming potentials related to groundwater movement. Streaming potentials are produced due to 283 \ndifferences in mobility of ions in the groundwater. In general, the region to which groundwater is 284 \nflowing is more electrically positive than the source area. 285 \nSelf potential measurements were undertaken along profiles occupying the four lines used for 2D 286 \nERT surveys and within an area broadly coincident with the 3D ERT survey area (Fig. 2B). The 287 \nseparation between measurement points along the four lines was 5 m. The SP mapping area 288 \ncomprised five lines parallel to the long axis of the survey area, with measurement points at 5-m 289 \nintervals and a line separation of 10 m. Data acquisition was achieved with a high impedance 290 \nvoltmeter and a pair of Pb\/PbCl (Petiau, 2000) electrodes, used as a reference and a roving 291 \nelectrode, respectively. Electrode positions were prepared in advance by hand-auguring shallow 292 \nholes, < 0.1 m deep, which were filled with bentonite slurry to ensure good contact between the 293 \nelectrode and the ground. The reference electrode was established at a fixed point, and the roving 294 \nelectrode was moved across the survey area to the prepared positions; at each survey point the 295 \npotential difference between the electrodes was recorded. During the surveys of lines 1, 3, and 4, 296 \nthe reference electrode was positioned at the midpoint of the respective profile at a distance of ~ 1 297 \nm from the line. Measurements on line 2 were carried out in three sections with the reference 298 \nelectrode located at 100, 300, and 400 m, respectively; measured voltage offsets relative to section 299 \n1, resulting from the use of different reference electrode positions for sections 2 and 3, were 300 \nremoved to produce a consistent profile. The SP mapping area was surveyed with a single reference 301 \nelectrode position, located in the centre. Prior to data collection, the electrodes were placed in a 302 \nwater bath to correct for drift. During the line surveys, each electrode position was occupied twice 303 \n14 \n \nby traversing down (forward) and then immediately back up (reverse) each line. In the case of the 304 \nmapping area, the roving electrode was migrated from the northwestern corner of the grid in a 305 \nsnaking north-south pattern to the southeastern corner (forward) and then back to the 306 \nnorthwestern corner (reverse). By collecting repeat measurements in this way, the time dependent 307 \nSP drift could be assessed. The calculated means and standard deviations (SD) of the drift for lines 1, 308 \n2, 3, and 4 were 0.8 mV (SD 0.6 mV), 1.7 mV (SD 1.3 mV), 1.4 mV (SD 1.1 mV), and 1.6 mV (SD 1.1 309 \nmV), respectively, and 2.1 mV (SD 2.1 mV) for the SP mapping area. In this paper, the SP survey data 310 \nare presented as 1D profiles for each of the lines and as a 2D contour plot within the mapping area. 311 \nIn addition, the SP mapping data were used to determine the likely 3D distribution of electrical 312 \ncharge accumulation in the subsurface. This was achieved by applying an SPT algorithm (Patella, 313 \n1997a, b, 1998), which calculates the cross-correlation between the observed surface potentials and 314 \nthe potential from a hypothetical scanning test charge. This technique has successfully been used to 315 \ndetermine the subsurface charge distributions of the Vesuvius volcano (Patella, 1997b) and the 316 \nGiarrossa (Lapenna et al., 2003) and Varco d\u2019Izzo landslides (Perrone et al., 2004). The cross-317 \ncorrelation is interpreted as a Charge Occurrence Probability (COP) \u03b7. This lies in the range -1 \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 1, 318 \nwhere a large magnitude indicates an increased likelihood that charge has accumulated at that point 319 \nand a negative value simply implies that the accumulated charge is negative. 320 \nThe self-potential tomograms in this paper were produced by calculating \u03b7(x, y) for a number of 321 \ndiscrete depth levels (z). The algorithm is based on a modification of the above technique that allows 322 \nfor the inclusion of topography (Patella, 1997b, 1998). Furthermore, higher order numerical 323 \napproximations to the cross-correlation integrals and derivatives of V were used (Wilkinson et al., 324 \n2005) to improve the contrast between low and high values of \u03b7 in the tomograms. 325 \n 326 \n4.  Results and interpretation 327 \n15 \n \n4.1. 1D (SP Profiles) and 2D (2D ERT, ARP and SP Map) Reconnaissance Surveys 328 \nThe 2D ERT models generated from survey lines 1 to 4 are shown in Fig. 4. Good convergence 329 \nbetween the measured data and the models was achieved, as indicated by mean absolute misfit 330 \nerror values of 1.0, 0.7, 0.8, and 2.0%, respectively. The principal geological formations can be 331 \ninferred from the models on the basis of contrasting resistivities. The full geological succession 332 \nassociated with the site is most clearly seen in the longest line, line 2, that extends outside of the 333 \nstudy site to both the north and the south. Both the RMF and the WMF are characterised by 334 \nresistivities of < 20 \uf057m, which are consistent with high clay content. The SSF, however, displays 335 \nhigher resistivities ranging from ~ 30 to 200 \uf057m, reflecting a lithology dominated by silts and sands 336 \nand significant geoelectrical heterogeneity. Factors causing the observed heterogeneity are likely to 337 \ninclude both moisture content and lithology. In particular, the high near surface resistivities (e.g. Fig. 338 \n4, Line 2, x = 150 to 200 m) are probably related to lower moisture contents because of drainage into 339 \nlower levels of the formation.  Intrusive investigations in the SSF at the study site have confirmed 340 \nthat it is a complex deposit (Fig. 3) displaying very significant variation in grain size and moisture 341 \ncontent, with multiple perched water levels and seepages. At the base of the slope within the area 342 \nformerly occupied by Lake Mowthorpe (Fig. 4, line 2), slightly more resistive deposits (20 to 30 \uf057m) 343 \nappear at the surface. This feature is unlikely to be related to bedding within the RMF as it does not 344 \nfollow the general dip of the formation to the north. Instead, these elevated resistivities may be 345 \nindicative of lake deposits, which have been observed from intrusive investigations on the valley 346 \nfloor to the SW of the study site. The results of the line 2 ERT survey indicate that these deposits 347 \nextend further to the east than indicated by the geological mapping (Fig. 1).  348 \nThe good resistivity contrast between the SSF and the mudstone allows the general dip of the 349 \nformations to be distinguished within the resistivity models; and significantly, it provides a means of 350 \nidentifying the extent and thickness of slipped WMF overriding the SSF, as observed particularly on 351 \nlines 2, 3, and 4 (Fig. 4). In section, the lobes appear in the images as low resistivity (blue-green) 352 \n16 \n \nregions encroaching as a thin surface layer onto high resistivity SSF (orange-red); these features are 353 \nseen particularly on lines 2 and 3 (Fig. 4). The horizontal extent of the WMF is clearly revealed by the 354 \nresistivity contrast with the SSF shown in the ARP resistivity map (Fig. 5). The RMF is not apparent on 355 \nthe southern edge of the ARP map, which may be due to a thin cover of resistive head deposits 356 \nobscuring this boundary. Coverage of the study site was limited by the terrain that in places, as 357 \nindicated by absent data, was too steep or rough to allow access to the ARP array. Those areas 358 \ncovered by the survey do, however, reveal the development of a number of lobes of slipped 359 \nmaterial, which are consistent with those identified in the geomorphological map (Fig. 2A). The most 360 \nclearly defined lobes are those seen on the eastern half of the study site where ARP coverage was 361 \nmost complete. 362 \nThe SP profiles for lines 1 to 4 display increasingly positive values from the top of the slope to the 363 \nbase, with ranges of 15, 17, 20, and 25 mV respectively. Comparison of the forward and reverse SP 364 \nmeasurements reveals a temporal drift in SP of up to 3 mV over a period of several minutes. The 365 \ngeneral trend of increasingly positive SP downslope is consistent with a streaming potential 366 \nsignature produced by infiltration at the top of the slope and accumulation at the base (e.g. Perrone 367 \net al., 2004). The trend of increasingly positive SP values is interrupted at the front of the active 368 \nlobes and at the base of the slope. At these locations, surface discharge of water was observed; the 369 \nformer being related to seepages directly from disturbed material at the tip of the active lobes (lines 370 \n2 and 4, Fig. 4), and the latter being related to the spring line at the interface between the SSF and 371 \nthe underlying and less permeable RMF (line 2, Fig. 4). 372 \nThe SP map (Fig. 6A) comprises a similar range of measured voltages, varying from 0 mV at the top 373 \nof the slope to 17 mV at the base, which is again consistent with a streaming potential signature. The 374 \nclose relationship between landslide morphology and flow is indicated by the distribution of the 375 \nmost positive voltages associated with accumulation at the front of the active lobes and in the gully 376 \nregion between the two lobes. 377 \n17 \n \n4.2. 3D Imaging 378 \nThe 3D ERT model is shown as a series of north-south trending vertical sections (Fig. 7), a plan view 379 \nof surface resistivities (Fig. 8), and as a volumetric 3D image shown in its geographical context with 380 \nthe 2D ERT models of lines 1 to 4 (Fig. 9). Good convergence between the measured data and the 3D 381 \nmodel was achieved as indicated by a mean absolute misfit error of 0.7%. Calibration of the 382 \nresistivity model and the identification of interfaces between the geological formations and between 383 \nthe slipped WMF and in situ SSF has been achieved using intrusive data generated from auguring 384 \nwithin this area; auger logs and locations have been included along with the 3D ERT model shown in 385 \nFig. 7 and Fig. 8, respectively. The succession from low resistivity RMF, to more resistive SSF, to low 386 \nresistivity WMF is clearly displayed and is consistent with that observed in both the 2D ERT and ARP 387 \nresistivity mapping surveys (e.g. Figs. 5 and 9). The interface between the SSF and the WMF indicates 388 \na dip of ~ 5\u00b0 to the north (Fig. 7). As with the 2D ERT models (Fig. 4), significant heterogeneity is 389 \nobserved in the SSF. The WMF is significantly more homogeneous, although a band of relatively high 390 \nresistivities (15 to 20 \uf057m), striking in an approximately east-west direction in close association with 391 \nthe back scarp, can be observed (Fig. 8). This may indicate a slightly more silt rich horizon or may be 392 \na function of better drainage, and hence lower moisture content, in the steep face of the main scarp.  393 \nVariation in the thickness of slipped WMF within the 3D ERT model can be seen in Fig. 7 as a 394 \nprogression from the western lobe, with a thickness of up to 4.5 m (Fig. 7, x = 0 m), to the gully 395 \nregion between lobes where slipped material is absent (Fig. 7, x = 19 m), and onto the eastern lobe 396 \nwith a thickness of up to 5 m of slipped WMF (Fig. 7, x = 38 m). The low surface resistivities (blue-397 \ngreen) of the 3D ERT model for y = < 80 m (Fig. 8) show the distribution of slipped WMF of the 398 \neastern and western lobes. Calibration using the intrusive data has allowed an improved 399 \ninterpretation of the extent of the landslide within the 3D ERT survey area. In this case, imaging of 400 \nthe buried interface between the SSF and WMF has allowed the extent of the zones of depletion and 401 \nzones of accumulation to be accurately determined. 402 \n18 \n \nThe 3D SP tomogram reveals a strong concentration of positive COP in the gully region in-between 403 \nand toward the front of the active lobes (Fig. 6B), indicating relatively little drainage through the 404 \nslipped WMF of the lobes into the SSF. Instead, the 3D COP suggests that the primary flows are 405 \ndownslope drainage and runoff from the relatively impermeable WMF and accumulation in the SSF 406 \nwhere it is exposed at the surface. Preferential charge accumulation, and hence drainage, into the 407 \nSSF compared to the WMF is indicated by the persistence of positive COP with depth where the SSF 408 \nis exposed. 409 \n 410 \n5.  DISCUSSION 411 \nThe combined use of 2D ERT and ARP surveys has provided complementary data sets with which to 412 \nassess the landslide structure. The 2D ERT has defined the position of key geological interfaces and 413 \nthe thickness of the foot of the landslide, whilst the ARP survey provided a high resolution map of 414 \nthe lateral extent of the slipped material. The reconnaissance data provided by these techniques 415 \nestablished the relationships between the main geological units, the geomorphologic expression of 416 \nthe landslide, and the geophysical properties of the materials associated with the landslide. The 3D 417 \nERT survey combined the advantages of the 2D ERT and ARP surveys. It has provided depth 418 \ninformation that, unlike the 2D ERT models, is fully volumetric and less influenced by 3D artefacts 419 \nthat can affect 2D models. In practice, a combination of 2D and targeted 3D surveys may provide a 420 \ngood compromise between coverage and resolution (e.g. Fig. 9).  421 \nThe effectiveness of resistivity methods for investigating the structure of landslides is dependent on 422 \nthe existence of good resistivity contrasts between in situ and slipped materials (e.g. Jongmans and 423 \nGarambois, 2007; Bichler et al., 2004). In this case, ERT has revealed the 3D form of major geological 424 \ninterfaces and has provided volumetric images of the foot of the landslide because of the good 425 \nresistivity contrast between the WMF and the SSF. Specifically, the 3D ERT model has revealed the 426 \n19 \n \nbedrock succession dipping ~ 5\u00b0, which is significantly more than the regional dip of 1\u00b0 to 2\u00b0 but is, 427 \nnevertheless, consistent with other observed dips in the area. Furthermore, the interface between 428 \nthe WMF and SSF identified in the model is ~ 50 m higher up the slope than identified in earlier 429 \ngeological maps of the area (British Geological Survey, 1983); results from this survey and additional 430 \nauguring have informed the most recent geological map of the area (Ford, in press, Fig. 1). However, 431 \na number of key structures were not successfully imaged using 3D ERT; these included the surface of 432 \nrupture and the subsurface continuations of the fault scarps and the slip planes between the 433 \nmultiple stacked earth flows comprising the lobes. This was because these features occurred wholly 434 \nwithin the WMF, which because of its relatively homogenous resistivity distribution did not result in 435 \nthe sufficient resistivity contrasts for these structures to be defined. The strengths and limitations of 436 \n3D ERT discussed here are likely to be pertinent for many other similar geological settings. In the 437 \ncontext of Lias Group rocks, scarps comprising failing mudstones overlying more resistive siltstone, 438 \nsandstone, or limestone formations are commonplace; therefore the application of ERT for landslide 439 \ninvestigation in these settings is likely to be a useful investigative tool. The detection of slip planes 440 \nand faults within clay-rich materials will continue, in many cases, to be a significant challenge for 441 \ngeophysical ground imaging methods.   442 \nSelf potential profiling, mapping, and tomography have provided a snapshot of hydrogeological 443 \nconditions within the landslide during the winter period when the landslide is at its wettest and 444 \nwhen most movement occurs. The information provided by SP is consistent with drainage patterns 445 \npredicted from geomorphological and geological analysis of the site; i.e., drainage is controlled by 446 \nthe topography with accumulations of moisture at the front of active lobes and between lobes, and 447 \nsprings occur at the interface between the SSF and the less permeable RMF. The SP signature seen 448 \nhere is approximately an order of magnitude lower than those observed in other landslide studies 449 \n(Bruno and Marillier, 2000; Lapenna et al., 2003; Perrone et al., 2004); this is almost certainly due to 450 \nthis study being concerned with a lowland landslide with relatively small slope lengths and shallow 451 \ngradients and, therefore, lower flow rates compared to these previous studies. The major benefits of 452 \n20 \n \nSP for landslide investigation are likely to be realised through time-lapse monitoring (Colangelo et 453 \nal., 2006), where seasonal variations in groundwater movement, which are likely to be related to 454 \nslope failure events, can be investigated. The observed streaming potential signatures suggest that 455 \npermanently installed SP monitoring instrumentation would be worthwhile for studying landslide 456 \nhydrology at this site. 457 \nIndications of moisture content variations within the landslide are not readily apparent from the 3D 458 \nERT model, as it is impossible to differentiate the influence of lithology and temperature from 459 \nmoisture content in a static one-off image. However, analysis of moisture content variation using 460 \nresistivity could be achieved through the collection of time-lapse data and the generation of 461 \ndifferential images in which the effects of geological heterogeneity are eliminated, thereby allowing 462 \nmoisture-induced resistivity changes to be quantitatively assessed. Future work at this site, which 463 \nwill build on the analysis of landslide structure and geophysical properties presented in this study, 464 \nwill involve the deployment of a geophysical monitoring network (e.g. Supper and R\u00f6mer, 2003; 465 \nLebourg et al., 2005) to investigate the hydrogeological regime associated with the landslide. The 466 \naim of this future work will be to investigate whether geophysical methods can identify 467 \nhydrogeological precursors to slope failure.   468 \n 469 \n6.  Conclusions 470 \nThe integrated use of geoelectrical methods in this case has revealed significant 3D structures 471 \nassociated with the landslide. The geophysical results are consistent with geological, 472 \ngeomorphological and hydrogeological information determined or inferred from other sources, such 473 \nas aerial LiDAR, differential GPS measurements, and intrusive investigations. Cross-correlation of 474 \nthese various lines of evidence allowed the geophysical images to be calibrated, and relationships 475 \nbetween lithological and geophysical properties to be established. 476 \n21 \n \nWhilst 2D ERT and resistivity mapping approaches have provided rapid reconnaissance level data for 477 \nthe site, a fully 3D ERT model of a section of the landslide gave detailed volumetric information on 478 \nthe structure of the bedrock and the foot of the landslide, as well as combining many of the 479 \nadvantages of 2D ERT and mapping. Likewise, 3D modelling of the SP data gave an indication of the 480 \naccumulation of groundwater within the subsurface, thereby providing an improved understanding 481 \nof fluid flow at the site beyond that gained from SP profiling and mapping alone. For inherently 3D 482 \nstructures, such as landslides, fully volumetric geophysical approaches to subsurface 483 \ncharacterisation are clearly preferable. 484 \nThe success of resistivity methods in this case was primarily due to the strong resistivity contrasts 485 \nbetween the weathered mudrock and the more competent underlying coarser grained silt and 486 \nsandstones. These contrasts were used to map the spatial extent of low resistivity landslide material 487 \noverriding the more resistive bedrock, to determine the interface between the zones of depletion 488 \nand accumulation, to determine the thickness of the developing lobes, and to establish the dip of 489 \nthe bedrock formations. Where significant contrast did not exist, landslide structure was not 490 \nrevealed. Of particular significance was the back scarp located in the WMF, which was not identified 491 \nfrom the geoelectrical data due to insufficient image resolution or contrast in electrical properties. 492 \nThe geological context considered here is typical of many situations in Upper Jurassic formations in 493 \nwhich weak mudrocks are sliding over coarser more competent and permeable formations. 494 \nConsequently, the successful application of 3D geoelectrical tomography methods in this study 495 \nprovides a basis for their wider application to the investigation of landsliding within the Lias Group.  496 \n 497 \nAcknowledgements 498 \nWe would like to extend our sincerest gratitude to Mr. and Mrs. Gibson (the landowners) for their 499 \ninvolvement and cooperation in the research.
