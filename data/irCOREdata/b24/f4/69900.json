J. Peyton, and Stephen J. Dickinson\nAbstract\u2014This paper presents a simplified model which can de-\nscribe the inductance change when an air-core coil is placed next\nto a thin nonmagnetic metallic plate. The model has two indepen-\ndent parameters and is valid for a range of thickness, conductivity,\nand lift-offs. Use of this new relationship provides a fast and ac-\ncurate method to measure the distance and thickness simultane-\nously. Measurements made for a sample coil next to thin copper\nand aluminum plates of various thicknesses verified the theory and\nthe proposed method.\nIndex Terms\u2014Distance and thickness measurement, electro-\nmagnetic sensors, frequency-dependent response, simplified\nmodel.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nQUALITY inspection and thickness measurement of metalplates using eddy current methods are affected by lift-off\nvariations. Furthermore, simultaneous thickness and dis-\ntance measurements of metal layers are required for a range of\ntechnological applications such as coating and surface treatment\n[1]\u2013[5]. A variety of coil designs have been used in these appli-\ncations. In method [2], a ferrite coil sensor was developed to\nmeasure the thickness and distance of a zinc-aluminum coating\non a steel sheet. A double air-cored coil method was proposed\nto eliminate the undesirable lift-off effect [3].\nIn most of these methods, theoretical impedance values were\ncomputed for a variety of possible combination of the parameter\nvalues, a set of parameters for which the theoretical data was\nas close as possible to the experimental data was chosen. This\nusually involves a simplex search method. For a large number\nof parameter values, the search process is time consuming. A\nfeature-based inversion method for conductivity and thickness\nmeasurement greatly reduced the time [4]. However, these fea-\ntures are still coupled together and therefore a multidimensional\nlook-up table has to be constructed to inverse the parameters.\nIn this paper, we have found that for an air-cored coil next to a\nnonmagnetic thin metallic plate, two features of imaginary part\nof the inductance values link to the thickness and distance of\nthe plate, respectively. Based on this finding, a rapid method of\nsimultaneous measuring the thickness and distance is proposed.\nManuscript received June 15, 2003; revised April 5, 2004. This work was\nsupported by the U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council\n(EPSRC).\nThe authors are with the Engineering Department, Lancaster University, Lan-\ncaster, LA1 4YR, U.K. (e-mail: w.yin@lancater.ac.uk).\nDigital Object Identifier 10.1109\/TIM.2004.830585\nFor an air-core coil, the general analytical solution for induc-\ntance change caused by a thin layer of nonmagnetic metal was\ndescribed by Dodd and Deeds [6]. This paper evaluated the an-\nalytical solutions of Dodd and Deeds for nonmagnetic plates\nof different thickness, conductivity, and lift-offs. It has been\nfound that the solution can be approximated by a simple scaling\nrelation.\n(1)\nHere, is the overall strength of the inductance change\nthat depends on lift-off for a given coil, and is independent of\nthe thickness and conductivity, is the characteristic angular\nfrequency at which the imaginary part of is a maximum.\nThe frequency depends on the conductivity and thickness of\nthe plate and is virtually independent of lift-off. The function\nis\n(2)\nMeasurements were made for a sample coil next to thin\ncopper and aluminum plates of various thicknesses using an\nimpedance analyzer (SL1260, Solartron). These results can be\napproximated by (1) and (2) to reasonable precision. Compar-\nison between the calculated and measured peak and\nprovides the lift-off and thickness simultaneously.\nII. METHODS\nThis section describes the procedures used to determine the\nsimplified model. First, the two limiting cases for with\nand will be considered with a physical explanation\nof the results. Then, the calculated and measured results will\nbe displayed. Further, the procedure to simplify the analytic so-\nlution of Dodd and Deeds will be given. Finally, simultaneous\nthickness and lift-off inferred from measurements are listed.\nA.

The real part and imaginary part of the inductance\nchange are zero, which means the nonmagnetic plate causes no\ninductance change and the magnetic flux penetrates the plate\nas in free space.\nIn the limit of arbitrary large frequency, the induc-\ntance change is given by , where\n. is dependent on lift-off for a\ngiven coil, and is independent of the thickness and conductivity,\nwhich corresponds to the situation that the incident magnetic\nflux is totally excluded from the plate.\nC. The Scaling Relation With Various Calculated Results and\nMeasured Results\nThe frequency-dependent inductance change for a coil\ndefined by , , , and\nis plotted in Fig. 2. The conductivity of the plate was\nchosen to be 5.8 (copper) and thickness was chosen to\nbe 22 , . The lift-off was chosen\nto be 1 mm.\nOn examination of Fig. 2, peaks at a characteristic\nfrequency , which is seen to increase as thickness decreases.\nFig. 3 shows the same calculations scaled by versus\nthe normalized frequency. All the calculations fall on the same\ncurve. On trials over a range of conductivities and thicknesses,\nit was found that this common scaling relation could also be\napplied to calculations for plates with different conductivity\n(e.g., 3.82 for aluminum) and different lift-offs (1 mm,\n1.1 mm\u20262.0 mm), the existence of this common scaling rela-\ntion was also verified by measurements from a coil (parameters\ndefined earlier) with aluminum and copper foil samples (see\nFig. 4).\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

RESULTS\nFig. 5 shows plots, which provide some verification of the\nsimplified model with analytic solution and measurements. As\ncan be seen, the simple model approximates the frequency-de-\npendent inductance change to a reasonable precision.\nThe estimation of thickness and lift-off from experimental\nresults takes two steps. (1) Estimate peak and from\nexperimental measurements. (2) Compare these two values\nwith precalculated peak and values for a range of\nthickness and lift-offs; those thickness and lift-off that produce\nclosest peak and with the experimental measure-\nments are taken as inferred values. Simultaneous thickness and\nlift-offs inferred from a number of measurements are given in\nTable I, which verified our model and measurement method.\nThe difference between the actual values and inferred values is\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

The larger error of\nthe thickness estimation may be due to the large frequency\nsweeping intervals used. In the process of simplifying the\nanalytical solution, the first approximation ( to )\nonly holds for small values of . As thickness increases, the\nerror due to this approximation becomes large. Therefore, with\nthis simplified model, the measurement range for thickness\nwould be between tens and hundreds microns. The measure-\nment range for lift-off is mainly limited by the sensitivity of the\ncoil and measuring instrument, because the inductance change\nof the coil would be very small for large lift-offs.\nMeasurement method based on a comprehensive model nor-\nmally requires calculation and measurement of the inductance\nchange over a large range of frequency. Its principle is to find in\na multidimensional table a set of parameters (i.e., thickness and\nlift-off) for which the calculation is as close as possible to the\nmeasured data in a least-squared sense. Therefore, it requires\na large storage capability to preserve the calculated data and\nlarge computation power to do the search and comparison. The\nsignificance in using such a simplified model is that it only re-\nquires measurements over a relative small range of frequency\n(i.e., near the characteristic frequency) and that only one-dimen-\nsional (1-D) search is required. These features may facilitate\nthe realization of this method in small portable instruments em-\nploying microcontrollers with limited memory and computation\npower.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nBased upon the described simplified model and the measure-\nment method, it is possible to realize a small portable measuring\ninstrument that is capable of providing real-time distance and\nthickness simultaneously. Future work will involve modeling\nother coil geometries, configurations (e.g., coils with rectan-\ngular cross sections and ferrite-cored coils) and frequency-de-\npendent response for magnetic plates. The field performance of\nthe sensor will be evaluated.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D. J. Harrison, L. D. Jones, and S. K.
