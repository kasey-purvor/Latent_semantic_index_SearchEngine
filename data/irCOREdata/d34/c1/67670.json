We study an isolated\nsubstorm (AE\u0001 300 nT) onset on 19 October 1999 at\u00010145 UT. The Polar spacecraft was\nlocated in the plasma sheet near the plasma sheet boundary and was magnetically conjugate\nwith the Greenland west coast magnetometer chain. Polar measured large-amplitude\ntransverse magnetic (10 nT; toroidal) and electric (20 mV m\u00021) field oscillations (\u00016 mHz)\nduring the early development of the negative bay (300 nT) in Greenland. On the ground,\npulsations (50 nT) with the same frequency were superimposed on the negative bay. The\ngeostationary GOES 8 spacecraft was located 2 hours west of Greenland. It observed\ncompressional magnetic field oscillations (1 nT and\u00016 mHz). At Polar the pulsations were\ninitiated \u00013 min before the first outward propagating substorm signature, an abrupt\nenhancement of the plasma sheet electron fluxes. Such a rich data set allows us to study in\ndetail the spatial origin of the pulsations, their timing with respect to the negative bay onset,\nand their role in initiation of the substorm current wedge. It is concluded that the pulsations\nwere initiated between the plasma sheet boundary and the tailward expanding region of\nthe enhanced plasma sheet electron fluxes. The pulsations were then later observed on the\nground and at GOES 8. It can also be argued that the pulsations were an integral part of the\nformation of the substorm current wedge. Finally, we suggest that the pulsations were\ngenerated by periodic variations in the rate of the current diversion from the braking region\nof the earthward flows generated by reconnection at the near-Earth neutral line.

Introduction\n[2] The substorm current wedge is a key element in the\ncoupling between the geomagnetic tail and the ionosphere\nduring magnetospheric substorms [McPherron et al., 1973].\nThe current wedge is thought to be formed at substorm\nonset as a partial diversion of the cross-tail current into\nfield-aligned currents that close through the ionosphere. The\nionospheric part of the substorm current wedge forms the\nauroral electrojet, which is responsible for magnetic dis-\nturbances such as negative bays observed by ground-based\nmagnetometers. Several mechanisms for the initiation of\nsubstorm current wedge have been assumed by substorm\nonset models such as the near-Earth neutral line (NENL)\nmodel [e.g., Baker et al., 1996] and the current disruption\nmodel [e.g., Lui, 1996]. Thus observations of the formation\nof the substorm current wedge are important for under-\nstanding the physics of substorms and future development\nof the substorm models.\n[3] Magnetic pulsations are a typical ground signature of\nsubstorm onset in a wide range of geomagnetic latitudes and\nlongitudes. A class of these pulsations defined as Pi2\npulsations occurs in the period range from 40 to 150 s.\nThese are closely correlated with other onset phenomena,\nincluding brightening of auroral arcs and electrojet intensi-\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 108, NO.

Thus the Pi2 band has been used extensively in\nsubstorm studies, for example, to determine the onset time\nor location of the initial brightening. In space, according to\nstatistical results of Sakurai and McPherron [1983], mag-\nnetic pulsations during substorm activity at geostationary\ndistances can be classified primarily by two types of\npulsations: (1) an irregular wave with a significant com-\npressional component and (2) a pure quasi-sinusoidal trans-\nverse wave in the azimuthal component (toroidal). Sakurai\nand McPherron [1983] concluded that the pure transverse\nwaves are quite rare, while the compressional wave occurs\nduring almost every substorm. According to the statistical\nstudy by Takahashi et al. [1996] \u000130% of the Pi2 events on\nthe ground are accompanied by nightside transient toroidal\npulsations in the frequency range of Pc3\u2013Pc5.\n[4] On the basis of theoretical considerations MHD\ntransients are expected to be excited by any change in\nmagnetopheric convection or configuration during sub-\nstorms [Southwood and Stuart, 1980]. High-latitude and\nmidlatitude Pi2 pulsations are thought to be caused by the\nsudden generation of field-aligned currents in association\nwith the disruption of cross-tail currents in the plasma\nsheet [e.g., Olson, 1999]. Also, the flow channel of\nenhanced plasma flows generated by magnetic reconnec-\ntion at the near-Earth neutral line is expected to excite Pi2\npulsations: the dawn-to-dusk electric field associated with\nthe flow channel is propagated to the ionosphere as an\nAlfve\u00b4n wave, and the field-aligned current associated with\nthe wave initiates the substorm current wedge [e.g., Baker\net al., 1996]. Low-latitude Pi2s are thought to be a\nresponse of the inner magnetosphere to compressional\nwaves generated at the substorm onset [e.g., Olson,\n1999]. In contrast to the extensively studied Pi2 pulsations\nlittle attention has been paid to the transient toroidal\npulsations and their generations mechanisms [Takahashi\net al., 1996. In general terms, these authors explained such\npulsations as MHD transients produced by the reconfigu-\nration of the near-Earth magnetotail. Considering the\nambiguities in the generating mechanisms of the pulsations\nin the overlapping frequency ranges of Pi2s and Pc5s and\nthe extensive use of this frequency range in the substorm\nstudies, it is important to understand any processes gener-\nating pulsations in this frequency range to establish their\nrole in substorm activity.\n[5] An important way to consider the effects of various\nfield variations in space on the substorm physics is the\nmagnetic field-aligned Poynting flux associated with the\nvariations. Recently, there have been several studies of\nlarge parallel Poynting flux on auroral magnetic field lines\nduring substorm activity. Toivanen et al. [2001b] presented\nobservations of large Poynting flux associated with mag-\nnetic field and plasma flow variations obtained by the Polar\nspacecraft in the high-latitude plasma sheet. Timing of\nthese variations corresponded to the Pi2 and visible auroral\nonsets at magnetically conjugate ground stations [Toivanen\net al., 2001a]. Similar field variations occurring near or at\nthe plasma sheet boundary during substorm activity have\nalso been studied by Keiling et al. [2000]. According to\nWygant et al. [2000], these variations and Poynting flux\noccur on auroral field lines conjugate to bright auroras as\ndetermined from the Ultra-Violet Imager (UVI) on board\nPolar. Parallel Poynting flux has also been reported by\nErickson et al. [2000] in the CRRES spacecraft data sets.\nAccording to these authors, there is another source region\nof large parallel Poynting flux located in the near-Earth\nplasma sheet, and this region is associated with the near-\ngeosynchronous onset mechanisms. As there seem to be\ntwo spatial sources of large parallel Poynting flux, it is\nimportant to present detailed multiplatform observations of\nelectromagnetic field pulsations and associated Poynting\nflux in order to address the spatial origin, the timing with\nrespect to various ground signatures, and the role of the\npulsations in the initiation of the substorm current wedge\nand in the physics of substorms.\n2. Observations\n2.1. Ground Activity\n[6] On 19 October 1999 an isolated substorm occurred\nwith AE reaching \u0001300 nT. It was first observed shortly\nbefore 0145 UT by the southernmost of the Greenland\nmagnetometers in Narsarsuaq (NAQ; 66.31 CGM latitude,\n43.91 CGM longitude). Figure 1 shows the northward\n(Figure 1a), eastward (Figure 1b), and vertical (Figure 1c)\ncomponents as functions of time at the Greenland west coast\nstations (Figure 2). The vertical line at 0144:23 UT marks\nthe initiation of the substorm-related signatures at Polar as\ndefined in section 2.5. The northward component shows\na very weak deflection (\u00017 nT) at NAQ beginning at\n\u00010142 UT, but the actual northward expansion of the\nnegative deflections took place after 0145 UT. The latitude\nof the auroral electrojet can be identified as the boundary\nbetween positive and negative deflections of the vertical\ncomponent (Figure 1c): At \u00010147 UT, the electrojet was\nlocated at NAQ and was moving northward. The positive\ndeflection from 0145 UT to 0147 UT at NAQ, FHB, and\nGHB implies that the electrojet enhancement initiated south\nof NAQ. Prior to 0145 UT, only a weak deflection of the\nvertical component can be identified, and no substorm\nelectrojet existed before 0145 UT within or in the vicinity\nof the west coast chain. The key features of this event are the\nlarge-magnitude magnetic pulsations in a timescale of a few\nminutes starting shortly after 0145 UT, lasting until about\n0205 UT, and following with the northward propagation\nof the auroral electrojet. These can be seen as periodic\nvariations in all three components shown in Figure 1.\n[7] It can also be argued that the auroral electrojet was\nmeridionally favorably located with respect to the Green-\nland chain. After 0145 UT, the magnitude of the eastward\ndeflection is small relative to the values observed after\n0150 UT. The negative eastward component after 0150 UT\nmay suggest that the magnetic chain was located between\nthe downward and upward field-aligned currents of the\ncurrent wedge. Midlatitude magnetometers located east\nand west of Greenland provide supplement observations in\ndetermination of the substorm electrojet location. East of the\nGreenland the magnetometers in Hella (HLL; 64.49 CGM\nlatitude, 68.36 CGM longitude) and Faroes (FAR; 60.76\nCGM latitude, 78.10 CGM longitude) of the SAMNET\nmagnetometer chain observed a negative bay and sequence\nof the Pi2 pulsatations (\u000117 mHz), respectively, starting at\nabout 0146:30 UT (Figure 3). Analysis of the SAMNET\ndata using the model of Cramoysan et al. [1995] shows that\nthe downward FAC of the current wedge was located west\nSMP 1 - 2 TOIVANEN ET AL.: TRANSVERSE PULSATIONS AT SUBSTORM ONSET\nof SAMNET (D. K. Milling, private communication 2002).\nFigure 4 shows midlatitude magnetic field perturbations\nwest of Greenland in Ottawa (OTT; 56.7 CGM latitude,\n0.1 CGM longitude) and St. John\u2019s (STJ; 54.6 CGM\nlatitude, 13.2 CGM longitude). During the early expansion\nphase, the positive deviation of the Y component at STJ (and\nOTT) suggests that the center of the substorm current wedge\nwas located east of STJ. On the other hand, the positive X\ncomponent at STJ indicates that the center of the upward\nFAC current was located west of STJ. The small deviations\nof the X component from the baseline at OTT indicate that\nOTT was located near the reversal of the positive and\nnegative deviations of X associated with the upward FAC\nof the substorm current wedge. The positive deviations of\nthe X component after \u00010200 UT at OTT, can then be\nconsidered as a signature of the approach of the upward FAC\nto OTT. On the basis of these available observations and the\ninterpretations made, it can be concluded that the current\nFigure 1.

Solar Wind Conditions\n[8] The Geotail and IMP8 spacecraft were located in the\nupstream solar wind at rGSM = (6, \u000226, 5) RE and rGSM =\n(18, \u000233, 15) RE, respectively. Both spacecraft observed\nsteady solar wind conditions during the event starting at\n0125 UT after a reduction of the BZGSM component of the\ninterplanetary magnetic field from \u00022 nT to zero.\n2.3. Locations of the Polar and GOES 8 Spacecraft\n[9] Figure 5 shows the locations of the Polar and GOES\n8 spacecraft in the noon-midnight meridian (Figure 5a) and\nthe magnetic field line locations of these spacecraft and\nselected ground stations in the equatorial current sheet\n(Figure 5b). A superposititon of the International Geomag-\nnetic Reference Field (IGRF) and the magnetic field model\nof Tsyganenko [1989] (T89) was used to determine the\nlocations of the field lines in the equatorial current sheet. In\naddition to the dipole tilt angle, the T89 model requires the\nKp index as input. It was determined by comparing the\nactual Polar magnetic field measurements obtained by the\nMagnetic Field Experiment (MFE) [Russell et al., 1995]\nwith the T89 model predictions. The best fit to the data was\nachieved by using Kp = 2. At 0145 UT, the Polar and\nGOES 8 spacecraft were located in the premidnight sector at\nrGSM = (\u00026.6, 1.0, 0.7) RE and rGSM = (\u00024.4, 4.9, \u00020.3) RE,\nrespectively. Since the dipole tilt angle during this event was\napproximately \u000217\u0001, these spacecraft were not located as\nclose to the magnetic equator as their ZGSM coordinates may\nindicate. According to Figure 5a, it is apparent, that the\nspacecraft separation of \u00011 RE in ZGSM leads to a consider-\nable separation in the equatorial current sheet. At 0145 UT,\nthe magnetic field lines of Polar and GOES 8 mapped to\nrGSM = (\u000215.1, 2.5, \u00022.4) RE and rGSM = (\u00024.4, 5.2, \u00021.0)\nRE (Figure 5b). The locations of the field lines of NAQ,\nHLL, and FAR at 0145 UT are also shown.\n[10] In addition to the magnetic field mapping, direct\ninformation of the Polar location in the tail can be obtained\nfrom actual Polar measurements. Figure 6 shows an over-\nFigure 2. The ionospheric foot points of Polar from 0115 to 0215 UT (triangles) and GOES 8 at 0145\nUT (squares) as determined from the T89 and IGRF models.

Figure 6a shows high-energy electron fluxes as\nmeasured by the Imaging Electron Sensor of Comprehen-\nsive Energetic Particle and Pitch Angle Distribution Experi-\nment [Blake et al., 1995] (CEPPAD\\IES). The outer electron\nbelt can be associated with the high fluxes before \u00010130\nUT (the enhanced fluxes after \u00010145 UT are related to the\nsubstorm activity). The plasma sheet electron population\nwas observed by the HYDRA instrument [Scudder et al.,\n1995] (Figure 6b). The sharp decrease of the electron fluxes\nat \u00010237 UT indicates the boundary between the plasma\nsheet and the northern tail lobe. Prior to the boundary\ncrossing, the Polar spacecraft potential measured by the\nElectric Field Instrument (EFI) [Harvey et al., 1995]\ndropped suddenly in response to low electron fluxes in\nthe vicinity of the plasma sheet boundary. Comparison of\nthe electron fluxes and the spacecraft potential observed at\n\u00010145 UT to those observed near the plasma sheet bound-\nary at 0237 UT, suggests that Polar was located near the\nplasma sheet boundary at \u00010145 UT.\n[11] In the ionosphere, the foot point of Polar at 0145 UT\nwas located \u00011.4\u0001 south and \u000110\u0001 west of NAQ and \u000140\u0001\neast of the foot point of GOES 8 (Figure 2). As the auroral\nelectrojet enhancement initiated south of NAQ and near the\nGreenland west coast, the Polar foot point was favorably\nlocated with respect to the early changes in the electrojet.\n2.4. Magnetic Field Observations at GOES 8\n[12] Figures 7a\u20137c show magnetic field measurements in\na magnetic field-aligned coordinate system at GOES 8: X is\naligned with the ambient field (the observed field boxcar-\naveraged with width of 35 min); Y is perpendicular to the\nplane defined by the X component and the radius vector to\nthe spacecraft position (positive toward the west); and Z\ncompletes a right-handed triad. Figure 7d shows the eleva-\ntion angle of the magnetic field at GOES 8. In order to best\nrepresent temporal variations of the magnetic field eleva-\ntion, a linear trend has been substracted from the elevation\nangle defined as 180 arctan(BH\/BV)\/p, where BH and BV\nare the magnetic northward and radial components, respect-\nively. Such a linear trend is introduced by the motion of\nGOES 8 toward the nightside as deduced from the T89\nmodel in the given timescale of an hour. From 0145 to 0155\nUT, the magnetic field was fairly constant relative to the\ndeflections observed after 0155 UT (the periodic fluctua-\ntions during 0145\u20130155 UT are studied in detail in sections\n2.5 and 3). The negative (0155\u20130207 UT) and then positive\n(after 0207 UT) deflections can be interpreted as a passage\nof the upward field-aligned current of the substorm current\nwedge tailward of GOES 8. This is most probably related to\nthe westward expansion of the current wedge observed at\nOTT.\n2.5. Polar Observations\n[13] Figure 8 shows observations of several instruments\nonboard Polar in comparison with the observations of\nGOES 8 and NAQ summarized in Figures 8a, 8b, and 8c.\nThe X (posititive magnetic north) component of the mag-\nnetic field variations at NAQ indicates the earliest signature\nof the negative bay onset at \u00010145 UT (Figure 8a). In order\nto study the pulsations superimposed on the developing\nelectrojet, Figure 8b shows the X component at NAQ after\ndetrending over 180 s. The detrending was carried out by\nboxcar-averaging the original signal with a width of 180 s\nand subtracting the average signal from the original signal.\nThe amplitudes of the pulsations \u000150 nT were considerable\nin comparison with the magnitude of the negative bay\n(\u0001300 nT; Figure 8a). At GOES 8, magnetic pulsations\nwith amplitudes of the order of 1 nT were observed in close\ntemporal association with the ground pulsations (Figure 8c;\nthe ambient field at GOES 8 shown in Figure 7a detrended\nover 180 s). The electron data from the CEPPAD\/IES and\nHYDRA instruments shown in Figures 6a and 6b are\nreplotted in Figures 8d and 8e, respectively. Figures 8f,\n8g, 8h, and 8i show magnetic field data obtained from the\nMFE instrument. The elevation angle of the magnetic field\n(aMFE = 180 arctan(BZGSM\/BXGSM)\/p) is shown in Figure 8f as\ndaelevation = aMFE \u0002 aT89, where aT89 is the elevation angle\nof the T89 model. Figures 8h and 11i show the magnetic\nfield components BY and BZ perpendicular to an ambient\nmagnetic field at Polar. The ambient field (Figure 8g) was\ndetermined by boxcar-averaging (180 s) the total magnetic\nfield measured by MFE. The coordinate system used\n(same as in Figure 7) is convenient during the interval since\n(X, Y, Z) \u0003 (XGSM, YGSM, ZGSM). Figures 8j and 8k show the\nelectric field measurements obtained from EFI. Finally,\nFigure 8l shows the Poynting flux parallel to the ambient\nfield (the positive values correspond to Poynting fluxes\ndirected toward the ionosphere).\n[14] The key features of the Polar field measurements are\nthe prominent oscillations initiated both in close proximity\nto the negative bay onset and prior to the pulsations\nobserved on the ground and at GOES 8 (spectral analysis\nof these pulsations is presented in section 3). The large\nparallel Poynting flux with a peak magnitude of \u00010.5 ergs\ncm\u00022 s\u00021 associated with these oscillations indirectly indi-\ncates that Polar was magnetically conjugate to bright\nFigure 4.

Considering the time of the oscillations and the large\nPoynting flux toward the ionosphere, we define the substorm\nonset time to be the first enhancement in themagnetic (\u00014 nT;\nFigure 8h) and electric fields (\u000110 mV m\u00021; Figure 8k) at\n0144:23 UT. The magnetic field configuration started to\nbecome more dipolar\u00012min after the onset time as indicated\nby the elevation angle in Figure 8f.\n[15] The important aspect of the particle data is the abrupt\nincrease of the electron flux at \u00010147:30 UT as measured\nby HYDRA about 3 min after the onset (Figure 8e). Such\nincreases are typically caused by plasma boundaries moving\nwith respect to the spacecraft. At this time, one can also\nidentify a sharp gradient in the ambient magnetic field\n(Figure 8g) presumably caused by the diamagnetic effect\nof the enhanced particle fluxes. Note also that the Poynting\nflux peaked at this boundary.\n[16] Prior to the onset, there were weak dynamic signa-\ntures at Polar and GOES 8 at 0139:00 UT. On the ground,\nonly a weak signature can be identified. Between 0139 and\n0145 UT the decrease of the magnetic field X components\nboth at Polar (Figure 8g) and at GOES 8 (Figure 7a),\nsuggests that the signature was rather a causal precursor\nof the onset than a transient perturbation.\n3. Spectral Analysis of the Observed Pulsations\n[17] Further analysis of the pulsations observed at Polar,\nGOES 8, and on the ground is based on the Fast Fourier\nTransformation (FFT). The time interval transformed into\nthe frequency domain ranges over an integer number of\ncycles with a period of 180 s. The period of 180 s was\nestimated from the time series shown in Figures 8b, 8c, and\nFigure 5. (a) Polar orbit during the event in the noon-midnight meridian. Note the relatively large\ndipole tilt angle because of which, at 0145 UT, (b) the Polar field line maps clearly further in the\nequatorial current sheet than that of GOES 8. The mappings of the field lines of the magnetic stations of\nNAQ (Narsarsuaq), HLL (Hella), and FAR (Faroes) at 0145 UT are indicated with a square. The magnetic\nfield line mappings were made using a superposition of the T89 and IGRF models.\nSMP 1 - 6 TOIVANEN ET AL.: TRANSVERSE PULSATIONS AT SUBSTORM ONSET\n8h. Such time intervals are used in order to reduce smearing\nof the frequency component of interest: substantial smearing\ncan be expected as only a small number of cycles with\nperiod of \u0001180 s are present in the time series, especially in\nBY at Polar.\n[18] At Polar, the pulsations occurred mostly in the BY\ncomponent. This can be verified by the amplitude spectra of\nthe signals of Figures 8g, 8h, and 8i (Figure 9). The spectra\nof the BX and BZ are relatively flat compared to the spectrum\nof the BY component. Its spectrum shows two peaks, one\ncentered around 6.5 mHz (maximum amplitude at 5.6 mHz)\nand the other around 18 mHz. As the BY component is\nroughly aligned with YGSM, the pulsations can be considered\nas toroidal.\n[19] At GOES 8, the compressional component (BX) has\nan amplitude spectrum peaked in the same frequency range\nas the spectrum of the toroidal pulsations at Polar (Figure\n10). The frequencies higher than 10 mHz are mainly caused\nby the transverse components (BY and BZ). The amplitude of\nthe compressional pulsations at GOES 8 is smaller by an\norder of magnetitude than that observed at Polar.\n[20] In order to compare the spectra of the toroidal (BY)\npulsations at Polar and the compressional pulsations at\nGOES 8 to the spectrum of the pulsations at NAQ, Figure\n11 shows the spectrum of the detrended northward compo-\nnent at NAQ (dotted line). It is peaked in the same\nfrequency range as BY at Polar and BX at GOES 8. In\naddition, the spectrum of the electric field EZ component at\nPolar is also shown with dash-dotted line. It has character-\nistics similar to those of the magnetic field BY component at\nPolar. This justifies the filtering of the electric field signals\nin Figures 8j and 8k.\n[21] Finally, we study the phase shifts between the\nsignals of Figures 8b (NAQ: detrended XNAQ), 8c (GOES\nFigure 6. Overview of (a) high-energy electrons (17\u2013200 keV), (b) plasma sheet electrons (0.1\u201320\nkeV), and (c) spacecraft potential as observed by CEPPAD\/IES, HYDRA, and EFI, respectively.

The vertical lines indicate a dynamic\nsignature at Polar prior to the onset (0139:00 UT; deduced\nfrom Figure 8k), the onset time defined from the Polar\nobservations (0144:23 UT; Figure 8k), and the beginning of\na magnetic field variation perpendicular to the ambient field\nat GOES 8 (0155:00 UT).\nTOIVANEN ET AL.: TRANSVERSE PULSATIONS AT SUBSTORM ONSET SMP 1 - 7\n8: BX), 8h (Polar: BY), and 8k (Polar: EZ). First, the signals\nwere low-pass filtered based on the spectral analysis shown\nin Figure 11. Figure 12 shows cross correlations as functions\nof lag time from the onset time. At Polar, BY and EZ are\nanticorrelated with a phase shift of 33 s (lag time: 33 s),\nwhich can also be verified by comparing the time series of\nBYand EZ in Figures 8h and 8k. The correlation coefficient is\n0.88. The ground response (detrended XNAQ) is delayed by\n117 s with respect to BY at Polar (Figure 12; dotted line). In\nthis case, the correlation coefficient is 0.63. The maximum\ncorrelation coefficient of BY at Polar and BX at GOES 8 is\nonly 0.37 with time lag of 105 s (Figure 12; dashed line),\nalthough the spectra of these two signals are very similar to\neach other. Since such a low correlation, the cross correla-\ntion between detrended XNAQ and BX at GOES 8 is also\nshown in Figure 12 (dash-dotted). The maximum correlation\ncoefficient of these two signals is 0.68 with lag time of 129 s.\nThis implies that BX at GOES 8 was delayed by 246 s from\nBY at Polar. On the basis of these phase shifts, we conclude\nthat the pulsations in the frequency range around 6 mHz at\nGOES 8 and on the ground at NAQ were delayed at least\nabout 2 min from the pulsations observed at Polar.\n4. Pulsations and Substorm Activity\n[22] In order to interpret the presented observations, we\nseek answers to three questions: (1) How are the pulsations\nrelated to the auroral electrojet and substorm current wedge;\n(2) What is the spatial origin of the pulsations; and (3) What\nis the relation of the variations to the plasma sheet dynamics.\n[23] The oscillations at Polar occurred in very close\nproximity to the negative bay onset. Note that the use of\nground magnetometers may introduce an uncertainty in the\ntiming of the initial auroral brightening. A time lag between\nthe magnetograms and the auroral break up can be intro-\nduced, if the breakup did not occur in the meridian of the\nmagnetometer chain. As there were no global auroral\nimages, this cannot be fully confirmed. On the basis of\nthe midlatitude magnetometer data, the center of the upward\nFAC of the current wedge was located east of OTT and west\nof STJ, and the center of the current wedge was located east\nof STJ during the early expansion phase. According to the\nobservations of the SAMNET stations, the downward FAC\nof the current wedge was located west of the SAMNET\nstations. These observations indicate that the current wedge\nwas initiated around the meridian of the Greenland west\ncoast stations.\n[24] Furthermore, indirect evidence of Polar being mag-\nnetically conjugate with the auroral break up area can also\nbe presented. As mentioned earlier, the large parallel Poynt-\ning flux indicates strong auroral activity near the Polar\nionospheric foot point since large Poynting fluxes on\nauroral field lines have been shown to be magnetically\nconjugate with bright auroral displays [Wygant et al., 2000].\nIn addition, the amplitude of the magnetic oscillations (\u000150\nnT) on the ground were a considerable fraction of the\nmagnitude of the negative bay (\u0001300 nT). The oscillations\nwere closely related spatially to the auroral electrojet as they\nfollowed the poleward movement of the electrojet (Figure 1).\nThese considerations suggest that the oscillations were an\nintegral part of the initiation of the substorm current wedge\nand the substorm onset.\nFigure 8.

The vertical\nlines indicate the onset time (0144:23 UT) and the transient\nsignature at 0139:00 UT as determined from the EFI\ninstrument (Figure 8k). See color version of this figure at\nback of this issue.\nSMP 1 - 8 TOIVANEN ET AL.: TRANSVERSE PULSATIONS AT SUBSTORM ONSET\n[25] We argue that the oscillations were initiated near the\nplasma sheet boundary rather than in the inner magneto-\nsphere. According to the magnetic field model used (T89),\nthe Polar field line mapped to XGSM = \u000215.1 RE. During the\nsubstorm growth phase, the magnetic field configuration is\nmore stretched than that of T89 [Pulkkinen et al., 1991], and\nmapping of the Polar field line even further in the tail might\nbe expected. Such a mapping is supported by the HYDRA\nelectron measurements, since, prior to the onset time, these\nmeasurements indicated that the plasma sheet was relatively\nthin at Polar, if compared to the extent of the plasma sheet\nafter the substorm. The low electron flux observed by\nHYDRA indicate that Polar was located in the vicinity of\nthe plasma sheet boundary. This conclusion is also consis-\ntent with the spacecraft potential measured by EFI. Toivanen\net al. [2001b] noted a similar discrepancy in the location of\nthe Polar field line in the nightside plasma sheet deduced\nfrom magnetic field mapping and from the particle meas-\nurements: according to the magnetic field mapping the\nPolar field line crossed the equatorial current sheet at XGSM\u0001\n\u000210 RE, whereas the particle measurements indicated that\nPolar was actually in the tail lobes. Furthermore, high-\nfrequency electromagnetic oscillations and associated paral-\nlel Poynting fluxes similar to those in the event studied have\ntypically been observed near or at the plasma sheet boundary\nduring substorms [Keiling et al., 2000]. These arguments\nsuggest that the Polar field line mapped close to the distant\nX-line separating the tail lobes and plasma sheet.\n[26] The magnetic field observations at GOES 8 are in\naccordance with the interpretation of the Polar data, the\noscillations were not initiated in the inner magnetosphere.\nThe amplitudes of the 6-mHz oscillations at Polar were\nlarger by a factor of 10 than those observed at GOES 8. In\nprinciple, small amplitudes at GOES 8 could be explained if\nthe node of the pulsations was located near GOES 8 at the\nmagnetic equator. However, the exponential decay of the\npulsations at Polar is more coherent than the waveform\nobserved at GOES 8. Finally, the oscillations were first\nobserved at Polar and only later at GOES 8. These argu-\nments imply a radial propagation of these oscillations\ninward rather than outward. In addition, the elevation angle\nof the magnetic field at GOES 8 indicated that upward field-\naligned current was located tailward of GOES 8. This\nindicates that the region of current disruption and the\nsubstorm current wedge were located outside the geosta-\ntionary orbit.\nFigure 9.

The\nmaximum correlations are indicated with triangles, dia-\nmonds, squares, and stars. On the basis of the spectral\nanalysis, all of the signals were lowpass filtered (<9 mHz)\nbefore the cross correlation.\nTOIVANEN ET AL.: TRANSVERSE PULSATIONS AT SUBSTORM ONSET SMP 1 - 9\n[27] One of the key observations of this study is the\ninitiation of the pulsations at Polar \u00013 min before Polar\ncrossed the plasma boundary indicated by the abrupt elec-\ntron flux enhancement and diamagnetic effect in the ambi-\nent magnetic field. It is relevant to assume that this crossing\nwas related to the plasma sheet expansion and the region\nconfined by the boundary expanded outward. At this\nboundary, the parallel Poynting flux peaked up to \u00010.5\nergs cm\u00022 s\u00021, which indirectly relates the boundary to\nconsiderable auroral activity. The timing of the pulsations\nand the crossing of the boundary suggests that the plasma\nsheet activity related to the pulsations was initiated tailward\nof the boundary. Note also that the Poynting flux observed\nindicates that the boundary was dynamic rather than static in\nnature, which suggests that the crossing was not caused, for\nexample by magnetotail flapping.\n[28] On the basis of the suggested spatial origin of the\npulsations, one may consider the magnetic reconnection of\ntail lobe flux and the subsequent earthward flows as the\nultimate generating mechanism of the observed pulsations.\nFigure 13 shows a schematic of the key observations.\nBefore the reconnection of tail lobe flux, the reconnection\nof the plasma sheet field lines must have taken place\n[Coroniti, 1985]. This can be associated with the weak\ndynamic signature at Polar \u00015 min before the oscillations\nwere initiated (recently, Toivanen et al. [2001b] identified\nsimilar signatures preceding substorm onset signatures at\nPolar and suggested that such signatures were precursors of\nthe expansion onset, indicating the initiation of the recon-\nnection on plasma sheet field lines prior to lobe field\nreconnection). In Figure 13a the local thinning of the\nplasma sheet indicates the location of the reconnection of\nthe plasma sheet field lines that was considered to have\nstarted \u00015 min before the negative bay onset. Figure 13a\nalso clarifies the notion of the mapping of Polar field line to\nthe distant X-line. This was the case only until the recon-\nnection of the open field lines started, after which the Polar\nfield line mapped closer to the Earth, near the newly formed\nreconnection site. The fast earthward flows generated by the\nreconnection of the tail lobe flux have been assumed to be\nslowed down near the interface of the dipolar and tail-like\nmagnetic field configurations. At this interface, it has been\nsuggested that the cross tail current is diverted through the\nionosphere to form the substorm current wedge. This\ninterface is then expected to propagate tailward, and the\nregion of dipolar magnetic field configuration to expand\noutward. The crossing of the plasma boundary \u00013 min after\nthe first onset signatures at Polar can be associated with\nsuch an outward expanding region of enhanced fluxes and\ndipolar field (Figure 13b).\n5. Summary and Discussion\n[29] We presented observations from the Polar spacecraft\nof large-amplitude transverse electromagnetic 6-mHz oscil-\nlations in the high-latitude plasma sheet in association with\nan isolated substorm onset on 19 October 1999. In addition\nto the Polar observations, we used the Greenland west coast\nmagnetometer chain and the GOES 8 spacecraft. Polar was\nmagnetically conjugate with the Greenland chain, and\nGOES 8 was located 2 hours west of the chain. The\nobservational geometry was shown in Figure 5. The rich\ndatabase allowed us to (1) study the spatial origin of the\npulsations in the magnetotail, (2) determine the timing of\nthe pulsations relative to negative bay onset and other\nsubstorm signatures, and (3) relate the pulsations to the\nplasma sheet dynamics. The key observations can be listed\nas the following:\n[30] 1. At 0139:00 UT a dynamic signature was ob-\nserved at Polar including weak variations of electric and\nmagnetic field and associated Poynting flux parallel to the\nambient magnetic field. Also the high-energy electron\nfluxes increased slightly. Importantly, the ambient magnet-\nic field started to decrease at Polar and GOES 8 and\ndecreased continuously until the substorm onset, indicating\nthat the signature was not transient.\n[31] 2. At 0144:23 UT the first signatures of the wave\nactivity were observed at Polar. Polar was located near the\nplasma sheet boundary. 6-mHz oscillations with peak\namplitudes of 10 nT and 20 mV m\u00021 were identified. These\noscillations were transverse and polarized as dB j YGSM\n(toroidal). Oscillations with frequencies of 18 mHz or\nhigher were superimposed on the 6-mHz oscillations driv-\ning parallel Poynting flux predominantly toward the iono-\nsphere. On the ground, a negative bay with a magnitude of\n300 nT was initiated at NAQ. About 2 min later, 6-mHz\noscillations with an amplitude of 50 nT was embedded in\nFigure 13. Schematic of Polar\u2019s location with respect to\nthe plasma sheet boundary (between the light and medium\nshadings) and the outward expanding region of high plasma\nsheet electron fluxes (dark shading). (a) Prior to the onset,\nPolar was located near the plasma sheet boundary as\nsuggested by the electron and spacecraft data shown in\nFigure 6. The dent in the plasma sheet indicates the location\nof the reconnection site of the closed field lines. (b) About 3\nmin after the onset, Polar was engulfed by the region of\nenhanced electron fluxes. The pulsations observed origi-\nnated from the region confined by the NENL and the region\nof the enhanced electron fluxes.\nSMP 1 - 10 TOIVANEN ET AL.: TRANSVERSE PULSATIONS AT SUBSTORM ONSET\nthe developing auroral electrojet. Also at GOES 8, the\nmagnetic field showed oscillations primarily at frequencies\nof \u00016 mHz (compressional) and 14 mHz (transverse). The\n6-mHz oscillations started about two minutes after the\ntiming of the wave activity at Polar. The SAMNET stations\nwest of Greenland at HLL and FAR showed a negative bay\nand burst of Pi2 pulsations (\u000117 mHz) starting at about\n0146:30 UT. Together with the midlatitude stations of OTT\nand STJ, SAMNET stations indicated that the center of the\nsubstorm current wedge was located near the Greenland\nwest coast chain.\n[32] 3. AT 0147:30 UT the outward propagating bound-\nary crosses Polar location. The Poynting flux peaked (\u00010.5\nergs cm\u00022 s\u00021) at this boundary indicating strong auroral\nactivity at the Polar foot point. At GOES 8 or on the ground,\nno dynamic signature was identified.\n[33] 4. At 0155 UT the passage of the upward return\ncurrent of the SCW tailward of GOES 8.\n[34] Our interpretation of the key observations is in\naccordance with the predictions of the NENL model.\nAccording to this model, reconnection of the tail lobe\nmagnetic field generates fast earthward flows and the\nbraking of the fast flows in the inner magnetosphere at\nthe interface of the dipolar and tail-like magnetic fields\ndrives field-aligned currents of the substorm current wedge.\nDuring the expansion phase the region of dipolar field\nconfiguration has been expected to expand tailward [e.g.,\nBaker et al., 1996]. The timing of various signatures was\nconsistent with the prediction of the NENL model. Most\nnotably, the pulsations were first observed near the plasma\nsheet boundary and later on the ground and at the geosta-\ntionary orbit. Moreover, the expansion of the region of\nenhanced electron flux past the Polar location \u00013 min after\nthe wave activity started at Polar indicates that the pulsa-\ntions were initiated before any indication of outward propa-\ngating substorm signatures from the inner magnetosphere.\nSuch a timing sequence of the key signatures suggested that\nthe pulsations were initiated between the plasma sheet\nboundary and the outward propagating boundary of the\nenhanced plasma sheet electron fluxes and peak Poynting\nflux. On the basis of these considerations on the spatial\norigin of the pulsations, we associated the pulsations with\nthe magnetic reconnection, the subsequent Earthward flows,\nand braking of these flows.\n[35] Here, we suggest that under some magnetospheric\nconditions, the braking of the earthward flow and the\ndiversion of the cross-tail current from the braking region\ndo not occur monotonically. In other words, the process of\nthe flow braking and current diversion may exhibit periodic\nfluctuations in the strength of the diverted current depend-\ning, for example on the ionospheric conditions controlling\nthe closure of the diverted current. Thus it can be suggested\nthe generation mechanism of the observed pulsations could\nbe distinct from the generation mechanisms of the Pi2\npulsations. Note, for example that the frequency of the\nPi2s at FAR (17 mHz) were clearly higher than that of the\npulsations studied (6 mHz). The oscillations of the flow\nbraking process may have then resulted in compressional\nwaves that were then observed at GOES 8 with the same\nfrequency. The frequency of the waves at GEOS 8 similar to\nthat observed at Polar can be attributed to the behavior of\nthe compression and toroidal waves: the compressional\nwaves such as Pi2s in the inner magnetosphere are known\nto exhibit a constant frequency over a wide L range,\nwhereas the frequency of toroidal waves varies with L\n[Takahashi et al., 1996].\n[36] Long-period waves are often associated with pro-\nposed substorm onset mechanisms in the near-Earth region\nincluding those based, for example on the ballooning\ninstability [Roux et al., 1991]. Such association can, how-\never, be biased, because the observations in the near-Earth\ntail are more frequently acquired near the equator than in the\nhigh-latitude plasma sheet. For example, according to\nstatistical results of Sakurai and McPherron [1983], mag-\nnetic pulsations in the Pi2 frequency range at geostationary\ndistances can be classified primarily by two types of\npulsations: (1) a wave with a significant compressional\ncomponent and (2) a pure transverse wave in the azimuthal\ncomponent. The oscillations studied here fall into the\nsecond category. Sakurai and McPherron [1983] concluded\nthat the pure transverse waves are quite rare, while the\ncompressional wave occurs during almost every substorm.\nIn fact, in one of their example events, the toroidal pulsa-\ntions occurred when the magnetic field was directed almost\nradially inward (elevation angle of 23\u0001), which is a very tail-\nlike field configuration at the geosynchronous. Under such\nfield conditions the field line of a geostationary spacecraft\nmay map far beyond geostationary distance, as it was the\ncase with Polar during the event studied. Thus the occur-\nrence of the studied pulsations at geostationary spacecraft\nmay roughly correspond to the occurrence of high-energy\nparticle dropouts at such spacecraft.\n[37] The results and suggestions presented in this paper\nare based on a single event. However, on the basis of the\nevent studied, we were able to argue that the in situ\nobservations of magnetic pulsations in the frequency\nrange of Pi2 and Pc5 pulsations obtained in the high-\nlatitude plasma sheet are an important extension to the\ndata sets acquired in the equatorial plasma sheet and lead\nto new insights into the physics of the magnetospheric\nsubstorms.\n[38] Acknowledgments.
