Papers in\nDowning Street are written over 24 hours (if you\u2019re lucky), instead of\n24 months. And, in fact, they often do not suffer very much from being done\nthat way: I was surprised how good a job one can do in those circumstances.\nOf course, at least in part this was due to many years of experience in thinking,\nin reflecting and in accumulating knowledge, enabling me to make quick (and,\nI hope, occasionally accurate) judgments on the issues of the moment. But\nit also suggested to me that all those extra days, weeks and months spent in\nreading or writing academic papers may have sharply diminishing returns.\nBut let me concentrate on two major differences of substance between\nbeing an academic in academia and one in government. The first concerns\nresponsibility. As an academic in academia, I have engaged in many policy\ndiscussions, both proposing new policies, and criticising existing ones. These\ntasks were made a lot easier by the fact that it seemed as though what one\nhad to do or say was pretty limited. If the aim was to suggest a new direction\nfor policy, it was only necessary to provide the idea. It would be someone else\u2019s\nresponsibility (the politician or the civil servant) to develop the policy concerned\nand to make it ready for implementation. If the intention was to criticise an\nexisting policy or policy proposal, it was someone else\u2019s responsibility to think\nhow to deal with the criticisms: to respond to them, and, if necessary, to amend\nthe policy concerned \u2013 or perhaps to discard it altogether and to devise an\nalternative.\nBut when in government the option of irresponsibility \u2013 or of shifting\nthe responsibility on to someone else \u2013 is not open. Max Weber (1991: 116)\ndescribed irresponsibility as one of the two deadly sins in the field of\npolitics (the other was, perhaps surprisingly, lack of objectivity) and in this,\nas in so much else, Weber was right. What one says or does in government mat-\nters. People\u2019s lives will be affected for good or ill by one\u2019s actions or inactions,\nand this can never be forgotten. (In fact, of course, one is not allowed to forget\nit, particularly because some people will be affected adversely: the barrage of\ncriticism \u2013 often emanating from, or supported by, academics \u2013 is unremitting,\nand, it has to be said, is rarely balanced by praise from those who will benefit).\nMore specifically, those in government involved in making policy have to do\nwhat my colleague Nicholas Barr (who had a similar secondment experience to\nmine, only at the World Bank) has called the two parts of implementation: the\ntechnical\/administrative and the political (Barr, 2005: 298\u2013299). The first pro-\ncess involves resolving the technical problems, the non-resolution of which can\noften derail a policy. And the second involves working out the politics: the ways\nof dealing with the different interest groups involved. On the one hand, this\nrequires the appeasement of the losers, or, if the decision is not to appease\nthem, then to deal in some other way with the problems they raise. On the other\nhand, you have also to make sure that the winners appreciate their winnings \u2013\nand the fact that their winnings are the result of the policy concerned (a fact\nthat is often surprisingly unrecognised).\n320 G U E S T E D I T O R I A L\nOf course, the two \u2013 technical and political \u2013 can be, and often are, linked,\nwith technical issues being used by an interest group to derail or hijack a policy.\nIn the list of difficulties produced by the opponents of a policy, the trivial tech-\nnical problem often has an equal status to the more substantive one; and, since\nthey all have to be addressed in some way, the former can exercise a veto power\nover the policy.\nBut whatever the objection, as an academic in government, as with everyone\nelse there, you don\u2019t have the luxury of ducking the issue involved. You have to\ndeal with all these problems and find answers. You have to deal with all the\ndetails. And all this is far from easy.\nI have to say that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s only academics in government who have\nto confront these issues. I increasingly feel that academics outside have to as\nwell, especially if they choose to intervene in politics as a policy critic or analyst.\nThey are more powerful than perhaps they realise. A well-targeted criticism\nexpressed on television or radio can sink a policy, regardless of its overall mer-\nits. A competent analysis that highlights the losers from a policy development\n(and there always are losers) can do the same. On the other side of the coin, a\nnew policy idea that has both the technical and political aspects worked out\ncan be very influential \u2013 especially during an election period.\nSo how should academics outside of government who wish to make a contri-\nbution to policy behave? If they advocate a policy, they need to offer assistance\nwith resolving the technical details of implementation; and, at the least, they\nneed to be aware of the political issues involved, even if they are not in a posi-\ntion to deal with them. Academic critics of a policy have a responsibility, not\nonly to offer their criticism, but to suggest a way of dealing with it \u2013 or, if\nthey genuinely feel that the policy is completely without merit, to offer an alter-\nnative. It is both intellectual laziness and Weberian irresponsibility not to do so.\nI now get so impatient with a standard academic opening gambit: \u2018I\u2019m just here\nto ask a few questions. . .\u2019. In fact, it is easy to ask questions: it is providing the\nanswers that is the difficult part. If someone enters the policy domain and\nattempts to demolish a policy, it seems legitimate to ask him or her: \u2018Well,\nwhat exactly would you do?\u2019. Yet that question is seldom asked, and even\nmore rarely answered.\nA second substantive difference between academia and the policy world con-\ncerns the role of theory and evidence. At least one version of what academics in\nacademia are supposed to do \u2013 especially social and natural scientists \u2013 is to\ndevelop theories and test them using evidence. What are academics in govern-\nment supposed to do? In this connection, I am reminded of a story about one\nof my few academic predecessors in government, Professor (now Lord) Maurice\nPeston, who was special adviser to Roy Hattersley, a minister in the Labour\nGovernment in the 1970s. According to Hattersley\u2019s memoirs, on Peston\u2019s\nappointment, he was asked to supply a job description. He submitted one\nline: \u2018to provide spurious intellectual justifications for the Secretary of State\u2019s\nprejudices\u2019.\nGuest Editorial 321\nI should rapidly say that this is not a view of the academic\u2019s role in govern-\nment that I endorse, but it does point to a problem that everyone in government\nencounters: how to develop policy in the absence of conclusive evidence. It\nwould be good if academics in government could use such evidence to devise\neffective policy: indeed, evidence-based policy making is the gold standard.\nUnfortunately, the relevant evidence is usually not there \u2013 or, because good\nresearch takes time, it comes along much too late to be of use.\nSo what do policy makers do if and when they don\u2019t have all the evidence\nthey need? Well, they rely on theory \u2013 or on gut instinct (itself often the product\nof some long-forgotten theory). And they will then pull in such evidence as can\nbe found to support the direction that theory and instinct are taking them.\nAcademics can be useful to policy makers in both activities. They can provide\nthe relevant theory, assessing its merits and defects; and they can assess the evi-\ndence that does exist both for and against. For instance, in the work I did on\nuser choice in health care and education, I was able to draw on psychological\nand economic theories of behaviour, on the micro-economic theory of market\nsuccess and failure, and on public choice theory concerning governmental suc-\ncess and failure. I was also well placed to assess the evidence that had emerged\nfrom some of the choice pilots in health care (an interesting example of govern-\nment making a determined effort to obtain good evidence in a key area of policy\nbefore rolling it out), and to examine international evidence in the area. The\nconsequence, I believe, was \u2013 and is \u2013 much better policy in those areas. But\nthat is another story.\nSo what is the overall message? Academics in government do have an impor-\ntant role to play, especially in the assessment of theory and evidence. Academics\noutside government also have a key role \u2013 in the long run, a more important\none \u2013 in developing the relevant theories and in providing the evidence. But,\nwherever they are, academics have an obligation to behave responsibly. They\nhave the power to change the world, and that power should not be exercised\nlightly.\nReferences\nBarr, N. and Crawford, I.
