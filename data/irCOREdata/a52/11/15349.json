These relationships have been \nattributed to sexual selection: women prefer tall men, and men prefer short women. It \nis this success in the marriage market which leads to higher RS for tall men and short \nwomen. We have already shown that the relationship between height and RS for \nwomen is quite different in a non-Western context. In a subsistence farming \ncommunity in rural Gambia, height is positively correlated with reproductive success \nfor women, largely due to the higher survival of the children of tall women. Here, the \nrelationship between height and reproductive success is analysed for men in the same \ncommunity. For these Gambian men, there is no significant relationship between \nheight and the number of children they produce, although tall men do contract more \nmarriages than shorter men. We conclude that environmental context needs to be \ntaken into account when analysing human reproductive behaviour. \nHeight and reproductive success   Rebecca Sear \n 3 \nINTRODUCTION  \nWomen like tall men. This has been demonstrated by laboratory tests of mate \npreference (Shepperd and Strathman 1989), in studies of lonely hearts ads (Pawlowski \nand Koziel 2002) and by observing which men women actually marry (Murray 2000). \nTwo studies have shown that this success in the marriage market leads to higher \nreproductive success (RS) for tall men, in that they are less likely to remain childless \nand have more children than shorter men (Mueller and Mazur 2001; Pawlowski et al. \n2000). This preference for tall men has been suggested to be adaptive. Height \ncorrelates positively with health, wealth and socio-economic status (Cavelaars et al. \n2000; Silventoinen 2003; Silventoinen et al. 1999; Turrell 2002). Women who choose \ntall men are therefore choosing healthy and successful fathers for their children.  \n \nMen, on the other hand, appear to prefer short women. This preference is not perhaps \nas strong as the preference women have for tall men, and may be driven, at least in \npart, by a desire for relationships in which the man is taller than the woman (Gillis \nand Avis 1980; Pierce 1996). Nevertheless, in laboratory studies of mate preference \n(Shepperd and Strathman 1989) and in studies of lonely hearts ads (Pawlowski and \nKoziel 2002), tall women do seem less preferred as potential mates than shorter \nwomen. A recent study found that men considered short women to be more \n\u2018nurturing\u2019 than taller women, suggesting that they may be seen as a better \nreproductive bet than taller women (Chu and Geary 2005). This lack of marital \nsuccess for tall women has been found to lead to a negative relationship between \nheight and RS for women (Nettle 2002b). Again, this finding was interpreted as the \nresult of adaptive mate preferences. Men are presumed to be attracted to those \nphysical attributes which indicate high reproductive potential in women, such as low \nHeight and reproductive success   Rebecca Sear \n 4 \nwaist-hip ratio and symmetrical features (Furnham et al. 1998; Hume and \nMontgomerie 2001; Perrett et al. 1999; Singh 1993; Streeter and McBurney 2003; \nSymons 1992). Since tall height was not assumed to be an indicator of reproductive \npotential in women, then there was no reason why men should show a preference for \ntall women. Instead men choose relatively short women, perhaps so that they can \nappear to be dominant in the relationship.  \n  \nThe studies described above have all been carried out in Western societies. Much less \nis known about relationships between height, marital success and reproductive \nsuccess in non-Western societies. Western societies have unusual demographic \npatterns in that, compared to non-Western populations, marriage tends to be late, rates \nof non-marriage are high, and fertility and mortality are both low. This difference in \ndemographic patterns means the determinants of reproductive success may be \ndifferent in Western and non-Western contexts, particularly for women. While the \nability to successfully obtain a mate(s) is likely to be a determinant of men\u2019s \nreproductive success in all ecologies, in traditional societies marriage tends to be early \nand universal for women. Successfully bearing and raising children to reproductive \nage may then be more important for determining a woman\u2019s RS than whether or not \nshe can find a mate (Strassmann and Gillespie 2002). We have previously presented \nevidence that the relationship between height and RS for women in a non-Western \ncontext is indeed different to that seen in the West (Sear et al. 2004). In a subsistence \nfarming community in rural Gambia, taller women have higher RS than shorter \nwomen. Taller women have later first births than shorter women, demonstrating a \ntrade-off between growth and reproduction in this society (Allal et al. 2004). But \ntaller women have slightly shorter birth intervals and, most importantly, significantly \nHeight and reproductive success   Rebecca Sear \n 5 \nhigher survival amongst their children, so that overall taller women have more \nchildren surviving to adulthood than shorter women. Here, we present a similar \nanalysis of the relationship between height and reproductive outcomes among men in \nthe same community, to determine whether the positive relationship seen for men in \nthe West holds in a traditional society. \n \nDATA & METHODS \nData \nThe data were collected from a population in rural Gambia which has been studied by \nthe UK Medical Research Council (MRC) since 1950. Ian McGregor began research \nin the area in 1950 and continued to collect data from this population until 1980 \n(McGregor 1991; McGregor and Smith 1952). He set up a demographic surveillance \nsystem in which literate villagers recorded all births and deaths that occurred in four \nvillages in this region. He also conducted surveys at least annually, during which he \ntook anthropometric measurements, as well as collecting medical information. During \nhis annual visits he took care to trace all villagers he had seen previously, and over 30 \nyears built up a database that contained much additional information alongside basic \nbirth, death and anthropometric data, such as information on migration and marriages. \nMarriages, however, were only recorded systematically for two of the four villages, so \nwe have only been able to construct marriage histories for a sample of the population. \nIn 1975, the MRC Dunn Nutrition Unit (DNU) began their own research programme \nin this area, which continues today. As part of their research station, the DNU set up a \npermanent medical clinic providing free contraception and medical care. This very \nrapidly reduced mortality rates in this population and also resulted in a decline in \nfertility, though fertility was much slower to change than mortality (Lamb et al. 1984; \nHeight and reproductive success   Rebecca Sear \n 6 \nSear 2001; Weaver and Beckerleg 1993). We have restricted most of our analyses to \nthe period between 1950 and 1974, when this was a natural fertility, natural mortality \npopulation.  \n \nDuring this period, the population depended largely on subsistence agriculture. No \ncontraception and little medical care was available, and both mortality and fertility \nwere high (Billewicz and McGregor 1981). Women gave birth to around 7 children on \naverage, but almost half died before reaching adulthood. Marriage was universal and \noccurred early for women (mean age at first birth was 18 years), and women \nremarried rapidly after widowhood or divorce. Men married later (mean age at first \nbirth was 31 years), and aspired to polygynous marriage. By the age of 45 half of all \nmen had had at least 2 wives, and of those that survived into their 70s only a quarter \nhad only been married once. These marriages were relatively unstable (Thompson \n1965). Divorce and remarriage were not uncommon, and a high proportion of \nmarriages (~30%) ended without producing children (suggesting they were of brief \nduration). Choice of marital partner, particularly for women and particularly for first \nmarriages, may have been relatively limited. Women were traditionally betrothed at a \nvery young age, before puberty, and their husbands would have been chosen by \nparents or guardians, although they would have had more control over their \nsubsequent marriages. The highly polygynous nature of the society meant that women \nwere always in demand on the marriage market, and women usually spent their entire \nadult lives in the married state. Child-bearing outside marriage was therefore \nunknown. The levirate was practiced (widows marrying their dead husband\u2019s brother), \nand estimates suggest that around 40% of widows may have been inherited in this \nway (Thompson 1965). Even after their reproductive years had ended, women who \nHeight and reproductive success   Rebecca Sear \n 7 \nwere divorced or widowed would contract \u2018nominal\u2019 marriages, so that on their deaths \nthey would have a husband to hand them into heaven.  \n \nMethods \nThe relationship between a man\u2019s height and a number of components of reproductive \nsuccess were analysed for this population. Only the reproductive performance of those \nmen who had reached at least 50 years of age was investigated. The same cut-off \npoint was used for women when analysing the relationship between height and RS, \nbecause this restricted the analysis to post-reproductive women. Men do not have \nsuch an easily identifiable end to their reproductive lives, and the age of 50 was \nchosen so that the cohorts of men and women are comparable (and to maintain a \nreasonable sample size). Men\u2019s childbearing was almost complete by the age of 50: \nonly 17% of children were born to fathers over the age of 50 during the study period. \nThe man\u2019s age was included as a covariate in all statistical models, to control for the \nfact that some of these men will continue to reproduce after the age of 50. \nAnthropometric data were collected repeatedly from villagers between 1950 and \n1980, so a mean height measurement was constructed for each individual by \naveraging all height measurements taken from that individual after the age of 20. \n \nFertility. The effect of male height on a number of different measures of reproductive \nperformance was investigated: the probability of childlessness, age at first birth, total \nnumber of children born before 1975 (for those men who were not childless), and the \nnumber of these children who survived to the age of 14. The latter variable comes \nclosest to an estimate of reproductive success, as it is an indication of the number of \nchildren who survive to reproductive age. Logistic regression was used to analyse the \nHeight and reproductive success   Rebecca Sear \n 8 \nprobability of childlessness. Linear regression was used to analyse age at first birth, \nnumber of children born and number of surviving children. In all models, the man\u2019s \nage at death or censoring was entered as a covariate (men without a known date of \ndeath were censored at the date when they were last known to be alive. All men still \nalive at the start of 1975 were censored on the 1\nst\n January 1975). Dummy variables \nwere entered for village and cohort of birth to control for any differences in fertility \nbetween villages and between birth cohorts. The fertility of older men may be under-\nestimated, as accurate records of births were only collected from 1950 onwards. \nIncluding a variable for birth cohort should control for this potential bias. To test for a \nnon-linear relationship between height and reproductive outcomes, a term for height \nsquared was included in all models.  \n \nMarriage. The relationship between height and marital success was also examined. \nFor this analysis only data from two villages was used, as complete marriage histories \ncould only be constructed for two of the four villages. For these villages, there is \ninformation on who married whom, but not when these marriages took place. Since \nthere is no data on the timing of marriages, the analysis cannot be restricted to \nmarriages contracted before 1975 and instead the analysis includes all data collected \nbetween 1950 and 1980 when McGregor\u2019s project (and therefore collection of \nmarriage data) ended. There is evidence to suggest marriage patterns have changed \nsomewhat in recent years in this population, but this appears to have been a very \nrecent phenomenon (i.e. age at marriage for women seems to have increased since the \n1990s: N Allal, pers. comm.).  \n \nHeight and reproductive success   Rebecca Sear \n 9 \nMarriage is virtually universal for this sample of men (only 4 had never married by \nthe age of 50), so no statistical tests were run on the probability of marriage. Linear \nregression was used to determine whether there was a correlation between height and \nthe number of marriages contracted, including in the sample only those men who had \nat least one marriage. The relationship between height and divorce was also \ninvestigated. Logistic regression was used to determine the effect of height on the \nprobability of divorce. The dependent variable was coded as a dichotomy: never-\ndivorced and ever-divorced (the sample included only ever-married men). Linear \nregression was used to examine the effect of height on the number of divorces. Again, \nall models controlled for village and cohort of birth, and the man\u2019s age at death or \ncensoring (in this case, men still alive in 1980 were censored on the 1\nst\n January 1980). \nBoth linear and non-linear functions of height were tested, the latter by including a \nheight squared term in the model. \n \nRESULTS \nDescriptive analysis \nTable 1 provides a summary of height and reproductive outcomes for men in this \nsample. On average men were just under 168cm tall (about 5\u20196). 15.8% of the whole \nsample were childless. Of those who had fathered at least one child, the average \nnumber of children born was around 8, and less than 5 of these survived to \nreproductive age. Of the men from the two villages where genealogical trees are \navailable, only 4 (2.1%) had never married by age 50. Those men who did marry, had \nan average of 3.35 marriages each (NB: this is the total number of marriages \ncontracted, not the number of current wives). Divorce was fairly common among \nthese men: 42.9% had ever been divorced, and 36% of the divorced men had been \nHeight and reproductive success   Rebecca Sear \n 10 \ndivorced more than once. When only this sample of two villages is considered, a \nslightly lower proportion of men are reported to be childless and slightly more \nchildren are recorded. Thus suggests there may have been some under-reporting of \nfertility in the other two villages, though these differences are slight (and all analyses \ncontrolled for village so that any potential under-reporting should not bias the results \nof the statistical analysis). \n \nInsert Table 1 about here \n \nStatistical analysis \nFertility. There was no evidence for a significant relationship between any fertility \noutcome and height (Table 2 shows the parameter estimates and significance levels \nfor the height variable in all statistical models). All relationships were in the predicted \ndirection (i.e. taller men were less likely to be childless, had earlier first births, had \nmore children in total and more surviving children), but none of these relationships \nwas statistically significant (Figure 1). There was no evidence for a non-linear \nrelationship between height and any of these reproductive outcomes: including a \nvariable for height squared did not improve the fit of any of the models, so this \nvariable was dropped from the final models presented in Table 2. \n \nInsert Table 2 & Figure 1 about here \n \nMarriage. Height was, however, correlated with the number of marriages contracted: \ntall men had significantly more marriages than shorter men. Height was not correlated \nwith the probability of divorce, nor with the number of divorces. There was no \nHeight and reproductive success   Rebecca Sear \n 11 \nevidence for a non-linear association between height and marriage outcomes, as the \nheight squared variable did not approach significance in any of the models and was \ndropped from the final models. \n \nThat height is correlated with number of marriages but not number of children is \nsomewhat surprising, given that the number of marriages contracted has a significant \npositive influence on the total number of children born to men (linear regression on \ntotal number of children born controlling for village and cohort of birth, and age: \u03b2 for \nnumber of marriages=0.92, SE=0.24, p<0.01). However, the r\n2\n values for both this \nmodel (adjusted r\n2\n=0.10) and the model correlating number of marriages with height \n(adjusted r\n2\n=0.15) are rather small, suggesting only a small proportion of the variation \nin the number of children is explained by number of marriages, and a small proportion \nof the variation in number of marriages is explained by height. As marriage is \nrelatively unstable in this society, counting the number of marriages may not \nnecessarily be a good predictor of reproductive success (if many marriages are brief \nand childless). \n \nDISCUSSION \nIn contrast to studies on Western populations, there is no relationship between male \nheight and RS in this rural Gambian population. The relationship between height and \ncomponents of RS is generally positive, implying that there may be some tendency for \ntall men to have higher RS. But if there is such a tendency, then it is very weak. The \nfertility rate in this Gambian population is much higher, and the variance in male \nfertility much greater, than that seen in the West (the most reproductively successful \nman in this population had 34 children). If a positive relationship between height and \nHeight and reproductive success   Rebecca Sear \n 12 \nmale RS were a robust and universal feature of human society, then it should have \nbeen much easier to demonstrate this relationship in such a high fertility society \n(Nettle 2002a).  \n \nThis analysis is not methodologically perfect. We have analysed the age-specific \nfertility of men over the age of 50 rather than reproductive success, as we do not have \na sufficiently long time-series of data to investigate completed fertility for a cohort of \nmen. Older men, who began reproducing before good quality data collection began in \n1950, may have under-reported fertility. But the latter problem, at least, also applies \nto women, yet we found a clear association between height and RS for women (Sear \net al. 2004). A further potential confound that has not been controlled for is paternity \nuncertainty. There are no quantitative estimates of paternity uncertainty in this \npopulation, but the large age gap between spouses, and late age at marriage for men \nsuggests some potential for uncertain paternity may exist. If tall men are strongly \npreferred for extra-marital affairs, then this could have the effect of strengthening the \nrelationship between height and RS for men in this population. However, though the \ndegree of paternity uncertainty does vary between populations, it is usually rather low \n(Anderson unpublished manuscript). We suspect the level of misattributed paternity in \nthis database would have to be unrealistically high for a significant correlation \nbetween height and RS to emerge. Overall, the most parsimonious explanation is that \nthere is no correlation between height and RS for men in this community. \n \nWe did find a significant positive relationship between height and number of \nmarriages contracted for men. A potential explanation for this is that Gambian women \nhave the same preferences for tall men that Western women do. Tall height should be \nHeight and reproductive success   Rebecca Sear \n 13 \nan even better predictor of health and wealth in the Gambia than in the West. In a \npopulation such as this, where food is sometimes scarce and infectious disease \nprevalent, there will be a greater environmental component to height and therefore \nheight should be more strongly correlated with good nutritional status and ability to \nfight off disease (Roberts et al. 1978). We have not tested the mate preferences of \neither sex in the Gambia, so cannot make confident claims about mate preferences \nhere. However, we have previously tried to investigate whether height is used as a \nmate choice cue in the Gambia by looking at the relative heights of husbands and \nwives (Sear et al. 2004). In Western populations, there is a strong male-taller norm, \nmaintained by the preferences of both sexes, so that husbands are almost invariably \ntaller than their wives (Gillis and Avis 1980). Additionally, couples mate assortatively \nfor height, i.e. tall men tend to marry tall women, and short men marry short women \n(Susanne and Lepage 1988). These patterns are both absent in the Gambia. There is \nno evidence for a male taller norm: in approximately 10% of all marriages the wife is \ntaller than the husband (which is no different from the proportion of female-taller \nmarriages that would be expected by chance). To provide a comparison with Western \ndata, we performed exactly the same analysis on the UK dataset which was used to \ndemonstrate a negative relationship between height and RS for women (data collected \nas part of the National Child Development Survey in the late 1960s: Nettle 2002b). \nThe percentage of female-taller marriages in this UK population was considerably \nless than in the Gambia (3.7%), and this percentage was significantly different from \nthat expected if couples had paired up randomly for height (Figure 2). There is also no \ncorrelation between the heights of husbands and wives in the Gambia (see also \nRoberts et al. 1978), although a significant positive correlation between the heights of \nHeight and reproductive success   Rebecca Sear \n 14 \nhusbands and wives can be seen in the comparison UK population (Figure 3, and see \nMascie-Taylor 1987). \n \nIn the absence of any other evidence that height is used as a mate choice cue in the \nGambia, it may be premature to suggest that the relationship between height and \nmen\u2019s number of marriages is due to female preference for tall men. There are \nalternative explanations. For example, taller men may be wealthier, and they may be \nable to afford more wives than poorer men (marriage in the Gambia involves \nbridewealth \u2013 a payment from the groom\u2019s family to the bride\u2019s family). A further \ncomplication is the relative lack of control that women have over their marriage \npartners. While the same logic should apply regardless of who is choosing a woman\u2019s \nmarital partner (i.e. parents should also prefer men who are healthy and wealthy for \ntheir daughters), factors other than physical appearance might be more important if \nparents are doing the choosing. Parents or other guardians may be more concerned \nwith establishing and maintaining social ties and political networks that enhance their \nown status and success and\/or that of the extended family as a whole. It is worth \nnoting, however, that a colleague did conduct focus group discussions with groups of \nboth men and women in these villages in 2001, which included some discussion of the \nkinds of qualities both sexes look for in a potential spouse. Neither sex mentioned any \naspect of physical appearance, though traits such as industriousness, honesty, and \nresources featured prominently (N.Allal, pers.comm.). While the lack of any mention \nof physical attractiveness does not necessarily mean it is unimportant in mate choice \nin the Gambia, it perhaps suggests other characteristics may be of greater importance \nwhen choosing a marriage partner. In a subsistence society such as this, where both \nsexes need to engage in hard physical labour in order to provide for their children, \nHeight and reproductive success   Rebecca Sear \n 15 \nevidence of an ability to perform this kind of work may be more important when \nchoosing a spouse. \n \nRegardless of whether underlying mate preferences are the same in the Gambia as \nthey are in the West, the relationship between height and RS for both men and women \nis clearly different in this subsistence Gambian economy compared to that seen in \nWestern populations. We suggest this is because the determinants of RS may differ \nsubstantially for both sexes in different ecological and social environments. For \nwomen in the West, success in the mating market appears to be a significant \ndeterminant of female RS. In many traditional societies, including the one studied \nhere, all women marry, and marry relatively young, so that differential marital success \nis likely to matter little in determining RS. In these societies, where medical care is \nabsent, child mortality may be much more important in determining RS. For men, \nsuccess on the mating market is likely to be a key determinant of RS in all societies, \nbut the precise nature of this relationship, and the importance of factors other than \nmating success may vary between populations. In the Gambia, given the frequent \ndissolution of marriage, the quality rather than the quantity of marriage may be \nimportant. Other factors, such as a man\u2019s health, may also be important. In societies \nwithout modern medical care, the ability to maintain one\u2019s own body condition is \nlikely to be an important component of RS for both sexes. It may be argued that this is \nanother reason for expecting a positive correlation between height and RS for men in \nthis society, since in Western societies tall height is generally associated with lower \nmorbidity and mortality (Barker et al. 1990; Marmot et al. 1984; Waaler 1984). But \nthe height-mortality relationship has also been studied relatively little in the \ndeveloping world, and analysis of this Gambian dataset suggests that the inverse \nHeight and reproductive success   Rebecca Sear \n 16 \nrelationship between height and adult mortality may not be found universally. There \nis no relationship between height and mortality in adulthood for men in these villages, \nand for women the relationship is U-shaped: both tall and short women suffer higher \nadult mortality than women of average height (Sear under review).  \n \nIn summary, our results suggest that a positive relationship between height and RS for \nmen, and a negative relationship between height and RS for women are not universal \nfeatures of human reproductive behaviour. Yet the results of analyses performed on \nthe height-RS relationship in Western populations have been used to explain the \nevolution of sexual dimorphism in the human species (Nettle 2002b), and the negative \nrelationship between height and RS found for women in the UK has been used to \nsupport evolutionary arguments in two other recent papers (Chu and Geary 2005; \nKanazawa and Novak 2005). We argue that constructing arguments to explain \nevolutionary processes in the human species based entirely on analyses performed on \nWestern populations is extremely dangerous. Basing such arguments on the study of a \nsingle society from any other region of the world is also dangerous, however, we note \nthat Western societies are additionally problematic in that the low mortality, low \nfertility and late marriage which characterise the West are likely to be very recent \ndevelopments in the history of the human species. Reproductive strategies may differ \naccording to social and ecological conditions, so that ignoring the importance of \nenvironmental context is not wise. In the context of mate choice, evidence for this has \nbeen presented by, for example, Furnham and Baguma (1994), Yu and Shepard \n(1998) and Wetsman and Marlowe (1999). All these authors have demonstrated \ndifferent mate choice preferences in non-Western compared to Western societies. \nWhile a preference for mates who indicate high reproductive value may be universal, \nHeight and reproductive success   Rebecca Sear \n 17 \nthe precise indicator of reproductive value is likely to differ between societies. In \norder to make confident claims about the universal nature of a particular human trait, \nwe concur with Wetsman and Marlowe (1999) that cross-cultural research is essential \nto test for these traits across a variety of ecological and cultural conditions.  \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThanks to the Gambian Scientific Co-ordinating Committee and Ethical Committee \nfor permission to use the data. \nHeight and reproductive success   Rebecca Sear \n 18 \nREFERENCES \nAllal, N., R.
