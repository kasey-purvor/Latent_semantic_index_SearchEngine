This paper describes the use of cluster analysis in an unusual\nsetting to classify a large sample of dyadic, highly interdependent, supply chain relationships\nbased upon the quality of their interactions. We show how careful attention to the detail of\nresearch design and, the use of combined methods led to results that were both useful to\nmanagers and make a contribution to knowledge.\nDesign\/ methodology \/ approach\nData relating to 55 monopolistic relationships in the UK defence procurement sector were\ncollected. Hierarchical Cluster Analysis using Wards Method was undertaken on scores from\nfive dimensions measuring relationship satisfaction. The resulting clusters are described in\nterms of the scores on the dimensions and also in terms of their relationships with data,\nquantitative and qualitative, exogenous to the clusters.\nFindings\nThe analysis reveals five distinct clusters of relationships. Statistically significant differences\nare evident in the scores on the five dimensions of satisfaction with respect to these clusters.\nThese scores lead to the labels \u2018Poor 1\u2019 Moderate 2\u2019, \u2018Moderate 3\u2019 and \u2018Good 4\u2019 being\nassigned to the clusters. The clusters display statistically significant relationships with a\nnumber of the exogenous variables including the value of the contract and the age of the\ntechnology involved. Relationships with the exogenous qualitative data are indicative of the\nvalidity of the clusters.\nOriginality \/ Value\nThis paper takes a novel approach to gaining an understanding of relationships through the\nuse of hierarchical cluster analysis. This provides an elegant way of exposing the influences\non relationship satisfaction at a disaggregate level which are not possible by taking an\naggregate approach. This will be of particular interest to researchers who are seeking\npatterns in large data sets and practitioners who can identify better practice guidelines when\nworking within supply chain relationships. The disaggregate approach using Cluster Analysis\nprovides extraordinarily detailed insights into relationship patterns.\nPaper type\nResearch paper\nKeywords\nCollaboration, Interdependence, Supply Chain Relationships, Cluster Analysis\n3Biographies\nAndrew Humphries PhD. has over 30 years of experience as a practicing, operational\nlogistician.

However; post Cold War\ndefence industry concentration matched to declining government budgets has resulted in a\nrestricted or monopolist market with attendant tensions that appear to block progress\n(Kovacic, 1999, Humphries & Wilding, 2004a, Serfati, 2001). The purpose of the research\nupon which this paper is based was to gain an understanding of the drivers of satisfaction that\naffect these high technology, strategically important relationships. To achieve this objective\nthis paper takes a disaggregate approach through the derivation of a taxonomy of these\nsatisfaction drivers in a way not possible through the use of a technique such as multiple\nregression analysis. The paper describes how patterns were sought using Cluster Analysis\nwithin a large volume of quantitative data which represented measurements of the strengths\nof managers\u2019 perceptions within 55 highly interdependent UK Defence Procurement dyadic\nrelationships. More specifically the paper describes how the taxonomy was produced from\n4measurement of five dimensions of relationship satisfaction and the relationships of the\nresultant groupings with other variables in order to facilitate an understanding of the\ntheoretical and policy implications of the taxonomy. This research follows the conceptual\nthrust provided by Lamming et al (2004) to disentangle the elements within a set of elements\nthat make up both the activity and the nature of business relationships.\nResearch Background\nFrom an interdisciplinary perspective Humphries & Wilding (2003) proposed that Supply\nChain Management, Relationship Marketing and Transaction Cost Economics (TCE) offered\nreasonably consistent views of the underlying drivers and development of collaborative\nbusiness relationships. Over the last 30 years in the face of increasing pace of change,\nglobalisation and customer sophistication business-to-business relationships have migrated\nfrom transactional\/adversarial roots (Lambert et al, 1996) epitomised by the Automotive\nIndustry in the 1970s and 80s (Sako et al, 1994) to more relational practices (Perks & Easton,\n2000). Moreover, these trends are evident in both the public and private sectors (Christopher,\n1997, Harland et al, 2000). The supply chain has evolved from logistics through process\nimprovements towards high value, complex supply chains requiring increasingly\nsophisticated linkages between customers and fewer suppliers (Lamming et al, 2001).\nRelationship Marketing describes developments from managerial marketing via networked\nstructures through to Marriage analogies, Key Account Management and virtual\norganisations (Sheth & Sharma, 1997). The International Marketing and Purchasing Group\u2019s\ndyadic interaction approach identifies context, parties, interaction and behavioural\ndimensions (Kern and Willcocks, 2002). More specifically, Brennan et al (2003) explore the\nrelationship-specific adaptations in which firms alter their business practices uniquely for\nindividual partners. Relational variables included trust, commitment and C3 behaviour (co-\n5operation, collaboration and co-ordination) (Wilding & Humphries, 2006, Spekman et al,\n1998). Finally, TCE\u2019s more technical level of analysis of the underlying relational factors in\ncontractual relationships described a trend to explain contractual relationships in other than\nmarket forces terms (Macneil, 1980). The concept of the hybrid mode as an intermediate\nstate between market and hierarchy to support various forms of long-term contracting\n(Williamson, 1996) acknowledged the need to explain the governance arrangements required\nfor more relational business dealings. However, within these bodies of knowledge there\nappeared to be limited integration of such ideas (Rindfleisch & Heide, 1997), or empirical\nresearch on long-term dyadic relationships (Rousseau et al, 1998) or, substantive research\ninto the attitudinal behaviours which generate adversarial practices such as power abuse, lack\nof transparency, poor communications and opportunism (Braithwaite, 1998).\nIn addressing these important theoretical issues it is possible to provide a clear contribution to\nknowledge about the dynamics of collaborative business relationships. Within the UK\ndefence procurement sector we chose the UK Defence Logistics Organisation as our research\nenvironment for a number of key reasons. Firstly it manages a large number of long-term,\nstrategically important, highly collaborative supply chain relationships with major industries\nand thus offers an ideal environment for the research. Secondly, the relative lack of\ncompetition in UK Defence Procurement provides an opportunity to focus on close-coupled\nrelationships without the distraction of market influences. Lastly, as already mentioned in the\nIntroduction, the Defence Logistics Organisation has long suffered from poor external\nrelationship performance and this research could potentially provide managers with useful\nideas for improvement.\nThe selected theoretical lens was Oliver Williamson\u2019s (1975) Organisations Failure\nFramework because of its emphasis on behaviours within transaction cost economising\n6situations (including governance arrangements to guard against opportunism and information\nimpactedness). Also, because this framework presupposes that highly interdependent\nrelationships within a limited or monopoly market situation will tend towards the adversarial\n(Williamson, 1996) it seemed to be particularly suited to the UK Defence Procurement\nsituation. The 5 dimensions used in the research were thus based on Williamson\u2019s (1975)\nOrganisations Failure Framework:\n1.

Value \u2013 the degree of share of joint relationship outputs (Small Numbers)\nAs well as using the TCE literature, the scale items used to measure the dimensions were\nderived from the Supply Chain Management literature (for its operational efficiency\nvariables) and, Relationship Marketing (bringing specialised business relationship variables\nsuch as trust and commitment) thus allowing 3 disciplines together to produce \u2018transcendent\ninsights\u2019 that would not be perceived by the individual disciplines working alone (Starkey &\nMadan, 2001).\nThe Empirical Basis of the Research\nA key informant data-capture approach was designed using both quantitative (questionnaire)\nand qualitative (semi-structured interview) methods, which aimed to measure perceptions\nfrom both sides of each relationship (Ganesan, 1994; Jick,1979). Operationalization of the\nresearch instrument concentrated on the five dimensions derived from Williamson\u2019s (1975)\n7framework the relationships; namely \u2018Creativity\u2019, \u2018Stability\u2019, \u2018Communication\u2019, \u2018Reliability\u2019\nand Value\u2019 using 5-point Likert scale items grounded in the relevant literature. The end\npoints of the scales were \u2018Very Satisfied\u2019; \u2018Very Unsatisfied. The Cronbach Alpha scores\nbased on the averaged item scores for each dimension are shown in Table 1. A score of at\nleast 0.80 is indicative of a high level of internal consistency and reliability (Bowman &\nAmbrosini, 1997) for the instrument.\nDimension\nCreativity 0.80\nStability 0.77\nCommunication 0.76\nReliability 0.77\nValue 0.88\nTable 1. Research Instrument Cronbach Alpha Scores.\nThe semi-structured interview design involved following-up the quantitative results by\ncapturing \u2018why\u2019 information from senior managers for each dimension of the relationship in\nquestion i.e. what were the key factors that resulted in success or failure? By this additional\nmeans it was intended to obtain the richness of perceptions needed to gain insight into the\nsubtleties and depth of the business problem. Under self-selected census arrangements data\nwere collected from 55 relationship dyads representing \u00a3575.8m annual spend\n(approximately one quarter of the total) within the sea, land and air business units of the UK\nDefence Logistics Organization. , Qualitative data relating to issues and their significant\nwere recorded usingsemi-structured interviews.\nAs discussed earlier this paper employs on a disaggregate approach to gain an understanding\nof the drivers that affect high technology, strategically important relationships To this end\ncluster analysis was employed and the next sections discuss the rationale for this decision,\ndescribe the process we followed and the results obtained. Finally we conclude by reviewing\nthe implications for theory, practice and research.\n8Cluster Analysis - An Overview of the Technique\nCluster analysis has been variously defined as: a family of techniques used to partition a set\nof objects into two or more groups based on the similarity of the objects for a set of specified\ncharacteristics (Everitt et al, 2001, Hair et al, 1984, Kaufman & Rousseeuw,1990); a\ntechnique that sorts observations into similar sets or groups; groupings where the statistical\nvariance among elements grouped together is minimised while between-group variance is\nmaximised (Borland et al, 2001, Ketchen & Shook, 1996) and also; a means of developing\nempirical groupings of persons, products or occasions which may serve as the basis for\nfurther analysis (Punj & Stewart, 1983). Methods of cluster analysis fall into two main\ngroups: hierarchical and non hierarchical. Since hierarchical methods are the most commonly\nused they will be the focus of the following discussion.\nHierarchical procedures involve the construction of a hierarchy of a treelike structure.\nThere are basically two types of hierarchical clustering procedures agglomerative and\ndivisive. In the agglomerative methods, which is the method used in this research every\nrelationship starts out as its own cluster. In this research each relationship was quantified on\nthe basis of the mean satisfaction scores on the Likert scales for each of the five dimensions\ndetailed in the previous section. In the cluster analysis, the two closest clusters (or\nrelationships) are combined into a new aggregate cluster, thus reducing the number of\nclusters by one in each step. In some cases, a third relationship joins the first two in a\ncluster. In others, two groups of relationships formed at an earlier stage may join together\nin a new cluster. Eventually, all relationships are grouped into one large cluster; for this\nreason, agglomerative procedures are sometimes referred to as build-up methods (Hair et al,\n1984). Hierarchical clustering methods do not require preset knowledge of the number of\ngroups which suits our large research data set. The method of computation used in this\n9method of cluster analysis is to first create a matrix of relative similarities (known as the\nsimilarity matrix) between all objects (for this research using the relationship satisfaction\nscores table) and then use this matrix as the basis for combining the relationships into groups,\nor clusters (Hair et al, 1984). The elements of the matrix are measures of similarity or\ndifferences between the observations with a commonly used measure being the Squared\nEuclidean Distance.\nWithin agglomerative hierarchical procedures there are different calculation methods\navailable for combining the observations into clusters. These include Single Linkage,\nComplete Linkage, Average Linkage the Centroid Method and Ward's Method (Hair et al,\n1984). Ward's Method links the pair of clusters that produce the smallest variance in the\nmerged cluster. It uses an analysis of variance approach to evaluate the distances between\nclusters. In short, this method attempts to minimize the Sum of Squares of any two clusters\nthat can be formed at each step. Of the alternatives Ward\u2019s method has the fewest inherent\nbiases Everitt et al, 2001, Ketchen & Shook, 1996, Punj & Stewart, 1983) and as a\nconsequence is used for the cluster analysis described in this paper. (. In consequence it was\nused for the Cluster Analysis described in this paper and we utilised the statistical software\npackage SPSS to carry out the calculations.\nIssues Relating to the Use of Cluster Analysis\nThe use of Cluster Analysis is not without its problems and this section details how, within\nthe context of this research, these were addressed.\nThe Selection of Variables: Attention to initial variable selection is crucial because even\none or two irrelevant variables may distort an otherwise useful cluster solution. There should\nbe a clear rationale for the selection of the variables (Everitt et al, 2001, Punj & Stewart,\n1983) and thus the first key part of the cluster analysis process is the selection of variables\n10\nunderpinned by a rigorously designed research. This problem was addressed by having a\nfirm theoretical base for research, namely Williamson\u2019s (1975) Organisations Failure\nFramework which yielded the five dimensions and by subsequently adopting a rigorous\napproach to the selection of scale items which involved firstly them being identified in the\nliterature and then verified and subsequently expanded based upon in-depth interviews with\nmanagers from the target industry (Faes et al, 2001, Olszewski et al, 1987, Sharma &\nLambert, 1990).\nThe Validity of the Cluster Solution: Cluster analysis has been criticised because several\naspects of the process require extensive reliance on researcher judgement. Lack of care\nespecially in the detailed research design phase, or the absence of a clear theoretical basis for\nvariable selection, means that the technique may generate clusters even when no meaningful\ngroups are embedded in the sample (Ketchen & Shook, 1996, Sutton, 2003). It is sometimes\npossible to split the sample, carry out cluster analysis on both sub samples and then compare\nthe results but this was not possible in the case of this research because of the size and\ncharacteristics of the sample. There is no standard tool for assessing the degree of\nconsistency and therefore the validity of cluster analysis solutions. An assessment based upon\ncomparison of results obtained from using different clustering methods (e.g. single linkage,\ncentroid method, etc) was rejected on the grounds that because the methods differ\ncomputationally so widely very different results are to be expected. Instead in this research\nemphasis was placed on the face validity of the cluster solution and its relationship related to\nvariables other than those used to generate the solution (i.e. criterion-related validity\n(Kerlinger,(1973) together with a clear demonstration that the classification has broader\nimplications (Faes et al, 2001, Punj & Stewart, 1983, Sharma & Lambert, 1990).\n11\nDetermining the Number of Clusters: Several methods can be used to determine the\nnumber of clusters arising from cluster analysis One approach is to visually inspect the\ndendrogram for natural clusters of dense \u2018branches\u2019. This is a somewhat subjective approach\nand so the following method was adopted for this paper. Wards method as previously\ndiscussed effectively produces minimum variance clusters. The merger of every possible\ncluster pair is considered and the two clusters whose fusion results in minimum increase in\n'information loss' are combined. Information loss is defined in terms of \u2018Error Sum-of-\nSquares\u2019. For each stage in the clustering process the Error Sum of Squares can be plotted\nagainst the number of clusters with a marked discontinuity in the resultant \u2018agglomeration\u2019\ncurve indicating the point in the fusion process where dissimilar clusters are being merged.\n(Everitt et al, 2001, Kaufman & Rousseeuw, 1990). Figure 1 shows the gradient of the\nagglomeration curve at each stage in the fusion process. It clearly shows a marked increase\nsubsequent to the production of four clusters, indicating the fusion of relatively dissimilar\nclusters after this point in the fusion process. Thus a four cluster solution was taken forward\nfor further analysis.\n0.00\n0.10\n0.20\n0.30\n0.40\n0.50\n0.60\n0.70\n0.80\n30 28 26 24 22 20 18 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2\nNumber of Clusters\nG\nra\ndi\nen\nt\nof\nA\ngg\nlo\nm\ner\nat\nio\nn\nC\nur\nve\nFigure 1. Agglomeration Graph.\nStandardisation of Variables: The computation of the similarity coefficients in Cluster\nAnalysis means variables with large values are given more weight than those with small ones.\n12\nThe remedy is standardisation of variables for example so that they have a mean of zero and a\nstandard deviation of one. Moreover, unusual or \u2018outlier\u2019 observations may also be present\nwhich might skew the cluster analysis validity (Kaufman & Rousseeuw, 1990, Ketchen &\nShook, 1996). In this research however, the data were from similar scales with no outliers\nand therefore standardisation was not necessary.\nCluster Topology\nThis section describes the results of the high level cluster analysis. The resulting taxonomy\nof relationships is characterised in the following section. As previously mentioned, Ward\u2019s\nMethod was used to identify four groups of similar relationships within the sample\npopulation of UK Defence Logistics Organisation businesses as shown in Figure 1. The next\nstep was to describe their characteristics using the quantitative and qualitative data and, to\nrelate the results to some additional, exogenous variables as recommended by Punj &\nStewart (1983). In this section we describe the clusters from a quantitative perspective and\nthen relationships with the exogenous variables and finally, provide findings relating to how\nthe qualitative data help characterise each cluster.\nStatistical Testing: The quantitative data was partitioned according to the five dimensions\nof the theoretical framework (Wilding & Humphries, 2006) and the mean relationship\nsatisfaction scores for each cluster are shown in Table 2. As explained previously these\nvalues are the mean scores from the five point Likert scales.\nCluster Label Poor 1 Mod 2 Mod 3 Good 4\nMean Cluster Satisfaction Score: 40.80 57.13 67.84 89.16\nNumber of Relationships in Cluster: 10 12 23 10\nCluster Dimensions Mean Satisfaction Levels\nCreativity - promoting quality, innovation and a long-term\napproach by encouraging high performance 35.30 56.66 73.36 91.60\nStability - synchronisation of objectives and confidence\nbuilding 32.60 48.16 63.09 88.10\nCommunication - shared data environment, openness, 54.40 66.33 63.31 83.40\n13\ncommon performance measures, frequent interaction\nReliability - concentrating on service and product delivery,\nlowering joint costs and risks, building up trust 28.90 45.58 62.63 90.20\nValue- creating a win-win relationship in which each side is\ndelighted to be a part 52.80 68.91 76.81 92.50\nTable 2. Quantitative Data by Cluster and Dimension.\nAnalysis of Variance (ANOVA) on the Mean Cluster Satisfaction Score shows a significant\ndifference (p<0.001) across the clusters. Given that a Levene test indicated homogeneity of\nvariances across the clusters post-hoc testing was undertaken using both the Least Squares\nDifference method (LSD). Results indicated significant differences (p<0.001) between all\npairing of mean satisfaction scores shown in Table 2.\nThe same procedures were used to test for differences in each of mean dimension scores\nacross the clusters and the subsequently across individual pairs. Given positive results for\ntests of homogeneity of variances Table 3 shows the results of the ANOVA tests and clearly\nDimension F Sig\nCreativity 85.28 <0.001\nStability 48.56 <0.001\nCommunication 09.11 <0.001\nReliability 21.73 <0.001\nValue 29.40 <0.001\nTable 3. ANOVA \u2013 Dimensions by Cluster\nindicates significant differences for across all clusters for all dimensions. Post hoc testing\nusing the LSD method showed that only in the case of one dimension, \u2018Communications\u2019,\nwere pairwise comparisons across clusters found to be insignificant (p<0.05). This result is\ndetailed in Table 4. All other comparison were found to be significant (p<0.05). These\nresults indicating the existence of clear well defined groupings.\n(I)Cluster (J) Cluster Mean Difference (I-J) Sig.\nCommunications Poor 1 Mod 2 -8.8 0.078\nMod 3 -3.0 0.516\n14\nTable 4. Post Hoc Testing Results\nFrom the interpretation of these results at face value, the four clusters of relationships, when\nmeasured in terms of satisfaction, appeared to fall into three main categories: Poor - Cluster\n1, Moderate Clusters 2 & 3, Good \u2013 Cluster 4. The differences between the Clusters can be\nclearly seen in Table 2 and for example, managers\u2019 concern over the Reliability of service\ndelivery arrangements in Clusters 1, 2 and 3 is clearly evident.\nRelationships with External Variables. In order to seek richer patterns within the\nquantitative data and to provide a measure of criterion-related validity, a number of external\nvariables were selected that could be used for linking with the clusters. The variables listed\nwere sourced from an internal UK Defence document on Improving Supplier Management.\nThe previously cited qualitative research suggesting that these variables might be related to\nrelationship satisfactionStatistical testing on the relationship between the clusters and these\nvariables was undertaken with significant results reported at the level p<0.05. The results of\nthese tests are discussed below and summarized in Table 5.\n# Variable Values Relationship\nto Clusters\n(p<0.05)\n1 Value of Contract in Year \u00a3 - Higher spend\n\u00a3 - Lower spend\nYes\n2 Relationship Duration Long: >20 yrs\nMedium: 10-19 yrs\nShort: 1-9 yrs\nNo\n3 Team Size Number in Team No\n4 Technology Age Old: >2 Upgrades\nMedium: 1-2 Upgrades\nNew: 0 Upgrades\nYes\n5 Technological Complexity System\nComponent\nNo\n6 Ministry of Defence Contractors\nLeague - Annual Spend per\nSupplier (DASA, 2001)\n1: >\u00a3250m\n2: \u00a3100m-\u00a3250m\n3: \u00a350m-\u00a3100m\n4: \u00a325m-\u00a350m\n5: \u00a310m-\u00a325m\n6: \u00a35m-\u00a310m\nYes\n15\nTable 5 Cluster Relationships with External Variables\n1 Value of Contract in a Year: Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) on mean scores for the\naverage value of the contract per year showed a significant relationship (p<0.048) with the\nclusters. Post hoc testing revealed significant differences between Cluster \u2018Mod 2\u2019 with a\nmean value of \u00a322.6m and Clusters \u2018Mod 3\u2019 and \u2018Good 4\u2019 with mean values of \u00a35.2m and\n\u00a34.25m respectively. Reference to Table 2 shows an interesting relationship with the mean\nsatisfaction scores associated with these clusters and provides criterion-related validity to the\nclusters. It is indicative that smaller value and hence less complex relationships are linked to\nhigher levels of satisfaction because they are easier to manage.\n2 Relationship Duration: At an overall level a link could be established between the\nduration of the relationship and \u2018Satisfaction\u2019 as shown in Table 6. No link was established\nbetween relationship duration and the clusters.\nRelationship Duration\nLong Medium Short\nMean Satisfaction Score 60.3 64.1 77.7\nn 26 19 9\nTable 6 Satisfaction and Relationship Duration\n3 Team Size: No relationship was detected with satisfaction scores and the clusters. This\ncoincides with the pattern found at an aggregate level. This was unexpected because one\nmight surmise that smaller teams would find it easier to establish and maintain better supply\nchain relationships because of the need to maintain fewer personal relationships. However at\nthe aggregate level a significant relationship (r = 0.65: p <0.01) was found with the value of\nthe contract. This is what one might expect with higher value contracts requiring larger\nmanagement teams and is indicative of the validity of the underlying data.\n16\n4 Technology Age: A relationship was detected between the age of the technology and the\nrelationship clusters with a Chi Square test revealing an association between the two\nvariables at p< 0.05. Clusters \u2018Good 4\u2019 and \u2019Mod 3\u2019 displaying relatively high proportions of\nrelationships (30% and 36% respectively) involving \u2018New Technology\u2019 It will be recalled\nthat these are the two clusters with the highest mean satisfaction scores. This supports the\nhypothesis that newer technology would be easier to support and therefore potentially places\nless strain on the relationship. However, statements in the qualitative data also suggested that\ngood relationships involving older technology could still exist because they had been\nestablished over many years. This may well explain the lack of relationship between\nrelationship satisfaction and the age of the technology that was found at an aggregate level\nand adds support to the disaggregate approach adopted in this paper.\n5 Technology Complexity: No link was found between the complexity\/size of the product\nand the relationship clusters. It might have been expected that the larger, more complex\nproduct relationships such as aircraft and tanks might, due to the size and difficulty of the\nmanagement task, be less successful that relationships dealing with components such as\nhydraulic motors. This issue requires further research to understand.\n6 Contractors\u2019 League: An association was found between the clusters and the UK Ministry\nof Defence\u2019s spend banding (League Table) of suppliers. The cluster \u2018Mod 3\u2019 had a\nrelatively low proportion (9%) of suppliers in the highest band of greater than \u00a3250 million\nspend per year. The cluster \u2018Mod 2\u2019 on the other hand had a relatively high proportion (58%)\nof relationship with suppliers who fell into this category. This supports the findings on the\nvalue of contract in a year. This is understandable because it was found that the higher\nbanded Suppliers tended to be awarded the bigger contracts. It should be noted that no\n17\nrelationship could be detected at an aggregate level between the position of a relationship\nwithin the UK Ministry of Defence\u2019s spend banding of suppliers and relationship satisfaction.\nThis analysis offered a number of useful insights that assisted with characterizing the\nrelationship clusters and also adds considerably to validation of the clusters in term of\ncriterion validity.\nCluster Characterisation\nIn this section qualitative data obtained from the semi-structured interviews is linked to the\nclusters to help understanding of the characteristics of each. The chart in Figure 2 shows the\nrelative size of each cluster and its position within the spectrum of quantitative results.\nFollowing the example of Olszewski et al (1987) we chose to give the clusters descriptive\ntitles to typify their character.\nFigure 2.

The satisfaction scores in Table 2\npresent levels well below the other clusters with only the Quality (52%) and Communication\n(54%) dimensions offering positive ratings. Analysis shows that these relationships were\nlikely to be higher spending and longer duration (>20 years) and, less likely to contain\nSuppliers from the top banding of UK Ministry of Defence Suppliers. Potentially one would\nthus expect adversarial conditions to apply with perceptions that efforts to improve or gain\nbetter equity were unrequited. It is also likely that in this cluster a high number of negative\nfeatures as typified by the theoretical framework might be found. The linked qualitative data\nrevealed that although there were some beliefs about poor supply chain practices and\nprocesses e.g. \u2018they provide no information so we cannot plan ahead\u2019, there was also\nevidence of adversarial behaviour resulting from the lack of competition in these\nrelationships. Feelings of \u2018imprisonment\u2019 and \u2018impotence\u2019 exacerbated by long term lack of\nco-operation seemed to have resulted in an ongoing situation of entrenched opposition to any\nform of innovation e.g. 'take it or leave it\u2019 is their attitude\u2019 and \u2018we are under great pressure\nto reduce our costs but they takes advantage of its sole supplier position by over-charging for\nproprietary items\u2019. As one might expect, the qualitative data did indicate efforts were being\nmade to seek improvements e.g. \u2018we both realise that the only way forward is to partner but\nthe supplier has had its own way for so long that it is very reluctant to change\u2019, The lack of\nreciprocation was clear and this was often attributed to a \u2018take it or leave it\u2019, \u2018no can do\u2019\nattitude. In conclusion, Cluster 1 appears to provide a fairly close fit to the negative\nbehavioural predictions of the theoretical framework which dwelt on issues such as\nopportunism and lack of trust.\n19\nMod 2 \u2018Evolving pessimists\u2019 (Moderate Low Performance Relationships): Cluster \u2018Mod\n2\u2019 represents a smaller group of 12 relationships, of \u2018moderate\u2019 satisfaction. Reference to\nTables 2 and 4 shows satisfaction levels to be \u2018moderate on the five dimensions with the\nexception of a low level on the Reliability dimension. It is likely that operating problems\nsuch as supply chain complexity, inherent difficulties in predicting customer requirements\nand either cultural or financial obstacles to process\/facility improvements are apparent and\ngenerally reducing the overall relationship satisfaction level. The qualitative data from both\nsides support this proposition .There were statements about poor supply chain practices e.g.\n\u2018they don\u2019t seem to have the resources to chase their sub-contractors who let them down\u2019 and\n\u2018their spares ordering point just seems to add more delay\u2019. However there were also\nstatements that link back to the type of adversarial attitudes found in Cluster 1 such as\nperception and cultural differences and, a lack of will to be co-operative e.g. \u2018without a\ncommon understanding of how we are doing and what we must achieve we cannot move\nforward\u2019 and \u2018they don\u2019t seem to realize we have production schedules and cannot stop\neverything to satisfy their instant requirement\u2019. It is thus possible to hypothesise that Cluster\n\u2018Mod 2\u2019 as a development phase between Poor and Moderate quality relationships where\nalthough the will to co-operate is growing , \u2018evolving pessimists\u2019, the ability to translate this\ninto reliable, supply chain services has yet to develop.\nMod 3 \u2018Stable pragmatists\u2019 (Moderate Relationships): Cluster \u2018Mod 3\u2019 contains 22\nrelationships and represents the larger of two Moderate \u2018Satisfaction\u2019 groupingss. Table 2\nindicates a level of satisfaction just above the mean of the other clusters with only the\nCommunication dimension just below this level. Table 5 shows that these relationships were\nlikely to be in the middle of the spending bracket, less likely to be in the top banding of MoD\nSuppliers and of more medium and short (1-19 yrs) durations. Potentially one would expect\ngreater incidence of \u2018C3\u2019 Behaviour (\u2018Cooperation\u2019, \u2018Coordination\u2019, \u2018Collaboration\u2019) and\n20\nreciprocity in these relationships with a more even balance of small numbers and normal\nsupply chain operating difficulties. As expected there was a range of views from respondents\nbut the expressions of positive pragmatism predominated e.g. \u2018because our organisations are\nquite small it\u2019s important to be realistic with our relationship improvement expectations\u2019.\nThe small numbers (restricted market) situation is openly acknowledged as a limitation on\nmanagement freedom eg. \u2018although they know full well we can\u2019t source their products\nelsewhere, the relationship is still amicable\u2019 but, does not seem to deadlock the relationship\nas occurred in come cases in Cluster \u2018Poor 1\u2019. Culture-matching appears to have taken place\nwhich has engendered a sense of \u2018being in the same boat\u2019 and \u2018stable pragmatism\u2019 eg. \u2018they\nare a bit like us; evolutionary, quality-oriented, resource-capped and not full of management-\nspeak. They are almost fun to deal with!\u2019. Moreover, many of the problems mentioned\nappeared to be those normally associated with the effective implementation of supply chain\nmanagement.\nGood 4 \u2018Successful integrators\u2019 (Good Relationships): Cluster \u2018Good 4\u2019 represents the\ngrouping of 10 relationships with high overall satisfaction scores as shown in Figure 2.\nTable 2 indicates a level of satisfaction well above the other clusters. Further analysis shows\nthat these relationships were likely to be lower spending, in the top banding of MoD\nSuppliers. These relationships are likely to contain high levels of interdependence, C3\nBehaviour, information sharing and innovation resulting in efficient, effective supply chains\nfocused on customer requirements. The qualitative data showed clear evidence of the open\nacknowledgement of the small numbers situation within the Good Cluster e.g. \u2018although we\nhave no choice in this relationship, by building trust and working hard to secure joint\nbenefits, it is a pleasure to operate\u2019 however, any opportunistic behaviours appeared to be\nnegated by joint concentration on the supply chain processes \u2013 \u2018successful integrators\u2019 - that\nensure optimal service deliver and mutual benefits e.g. \u2018we don\u2019t have a contract monitoring\n21\nteam because it creates distrust and adds cost, instead we all concentrate on customer-\nservice\u2019. A noticeable feature of this cluster was the importance of social interaction eg. \u2018our\npartnering arrangement is effective because of the excellent mix of individuals who really\nwork well together\u2019.\nConclusions: The Empirical Research\nIn this paper Ward\u2019s Method of Cluster Analysis has been used to identify in a disaggregated\nway patterns within a large body of data representing a spectrum of dyadic business\nrelationship satisfaction scores... This allowed a taxonomy to be identified as shown in\nFigure 2. Relationships between the clusters, and a number of exogenous variables gave a\nmeasure of criterion related validity to the clusters. It should be noted that some expected\nrelationships, for example with \u2018Technology Complexity\u2019 failed to materialize. This is not\nseen as being indicative of a weakness in the analysis but simply that the values of these\nparticular exogenous variables do not vary across the taxonomy. However this is clearly an\narea which would warrant further research. The clusters were further characterised using the\nqualitative data provided by managers as shown in the descriptive \u2018bubble chart\u2019 at Figure 2.\nFrom these analyses cluster groupings were recognisable as sub-divisions of Good, Moderate\nand Poor relationships, as measured in terms of satisfaction. A sub-group of the Moderate\ncategory (Cluster Mod 2) appeared to be a transition stage between the Poor and the\nModerate clusters where although managers had realised the need to \u2018break away\u2019 from\nadversarial behaviours, they had not yet translated their intentions into improved business\nprocesses and Customer benefits. Cluster analysis thus allowed us to reveal a taxonomy of\nrelationship types linked to exogenous variables and also qualitative data. This generated\nvery clear descriptions of the relationship dynamics within the data and which importantly\ndisplayed both criterion-related and face validity. .\n22\nConclusions: Implications for Theory\nFrom a theoretical perspective we are able to integrate Williamson\u2019s (1975) Organisation\nFailure Framework factors within a large empirical study. The disaggregate approach using\nCluster Analysis provides extraordinarily detailed insights into relationship patterns. The\nframework suggests that highly collaborative relationships within a limited market will tend\nto be adversarial because calculative trust (a focus on cost-effective contractual safeguards\nwhere failure to perform\/reciprocate are not forgiven (Hill, 1990, Williamson, 1996)) is\nunlikely to sustain high productivity when subjected to strong internal and external pressures\n(Faulkner & De Rond, 2000, Humphries & Wilding, 2003). However, that over 75% of the\nrelationships surveyed considered themselves to be successful (satisfaction rate 50% or\ngreater) undermines this general assumption. The use of Cluster Analysis enabled deeper\nanalysis of this high level view with four relatively homogenous groupings of relationships\nwith respect to \u2018Satisfaction\u2019 being identified. This approach, which subsequently mapped\nqualitative and exogenous data onto the clusters, then facilitated the identification of the\nsalient theoretical points. Importantly these points can be substantiated by reference to the\nrelevant literature. Thus a number of instances were found where dyads realised they were\nlocked into unsatisfactory relationships (Cluster \u2018Poor 1\u2019) and accused each other of\nopportunistically and cynically taking advantage of the situation to pursue their own\nobjectives. Other reasons for lower relationship performance were more prevalent. The\nresearch results indicate that normal supply chain business relationship issues existed within\nall the clusters as the customers and suppliers struggled to improve process efficiency\n(Harland et al, 2000, Peck et al, 2000). It was also apparent that managers in each cluster\nwere aware of their limited market\/limited choices environment and the inherent power-\n23\nbalance challenges (Cox & Lamming, 1997, Kovacic, 1999). However, it was especially\nwhere adverse conditions applied, such as poor relationship management and lack of\ninvestment in process improvement, that those small numbers dynamics (frustration at limited\nmanagement options and, adversarial behaviours) generated adversarial conditions (Serfati,\n2001, Sheth & Sharma, 1997). On the other hand, where the relationships were able to\nconcentrate co-operatively on service delivery and long-term, equitable benefits sharing and,\nwhere efforts were made to match corporate cultures and build trusting personal relationships\n(McDonald et al, 1997, Rousseau et al, 1998), the potential limitations inherent within the\nhighly interdependent dyads were minimised (Christopher, 1997, Humphries & Wilding,\n2004b).\nAlthough this research project took place within a limited business situation, it nevertheless\nallowed an integrated and interdisciplinarity approach to confirmed the general conclusions\nof many TCE, Supply Chain Management and Relationship Marketing writers and, to go\nmuch further by revealing a number of deeper dynamics in play within a substantial sample\nof long-term, collaborative relationship dyads. Further research is needed to test the\napproach in other business sectors and to examine in greater detail a number of more\ncomplex influences such as team and industry factors.\nConclusions: Implications for Practice\nThe UK Defence Logistics Organisation in question has long suffered from poor external\nrelationship performance which regularly receives press criticism. This situation is mirrored\nin other western countries. The findings from this research confirms Parker & Hartley (1997)\nand Serfati\u2019s (2001) views that a mindset that accept and face the challenge from reduced\nmanagement choices is an essential prerequisite to dealing effectively with the inherent\npressures of long-term collaborative relationships. Knowledge of where you are in the\n24\nspectrum of relationship types (e.g. Figure 2) can also help managers to decide what targets\nneed to be set and the remedial action necessary to achieve them. Moreover, the creation of\nan inventory of industry-specific endemic problems (in this case old, unreliable products,\nobsolescence, staff and organisational upheavals, poor end-customer visibility and lack of\ninvestment in modern procedures and systems) and finding joint, innovative ways to tackle\nthem is likely to provide the best opportunity to appears to be a very effective way of\nresisting the negative pressures implied by Williamson\u2019s (1975) Organisations Failure\nFramework. This research has identified a number of salient patterns from which better\npractice guidelines can be derived for practitioners operating in the UK Defence Procurement\nenvironment. Given the parallels with similar situations in other countries, there appear to be\nvaluable pointers for a wider \u2018population\u2019. It is suggested that this is an important area for\nfurther research should be undertaken to validate these possibilities.\nReferences\nBorland, J., Hirschberg, J. and Lye, J.
