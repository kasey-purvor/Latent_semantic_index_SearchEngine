Introduction \nNative neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors include the homomeric \u03b17 \nreceptors and heteromeric \u03b14\u03b22*, \u03b13\u03b24*, \u03b16\u03b22* and \u03b14\u03b16\u03b22* receptors which possibly \ncontain additional subunits (*) such as \u03b15, \u03b12 and \u03b23 (Zoli et al., 1998, Grady et al., \n2007). The \u03b14\u03b22* and \u03b17 receptors are the two main subtypes in the brain and their \nactivation can modulate various neuronal processes and functions (Vizi and Kiss, 1998). \nIn particular, loss of nicotinic receptor functions can cause deficits in cognitive, motor and \nreward functions in the elderly population and particularly in patients suffering from \nAlzheimer\u2019s disease (Perry et al., 2000) and schizophrenia (Freedman et al., 2000). \nTreatments that elevate levels of endogenous acetylcholine by inhibition of \nacetylcholinesterase are used clinically to alleviate symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \nRecently, positive allosteric modulation has also been proposed as a favoured therapeutic \nstrategy via functional enhancement of nicotinic receptors (Albuquerque et al., 2009). \nPositive allosteric modulators induce conformational modifications of receptors at \na site away from the orthosteric agonist binding site to enhance receptor function without \ncausing direct receptor activation, inactivation or desensitisation, thus preserving the high \ntemporal and spatial resolutions of endogenous nicotinic transmission (Albuquerque et al., \n2009). Recently, \u03b17-selective positive modulators such as PNU-120596 (Hurst et al., \n2005), compound 6 (Ng et al., 2007) and NS-1738 (Timmermann et al., 2007) have been \nshown to enhance receptor current, improve cognitive functions and reduce hippocampal \ngating deficits in rodent experimental models, hence providing validation for the potential \ntherapeutic values of nicotinic positive modulators.  \nIn contrast, few selective modulators have been identified and characterised for the \nmost widely expressed neuronal \u03b14\u03b22* receptors. Although the endogenous steroid 17\u001f-\nestradiol (Curtis et al., 2002), a Flustra foliacea metabolite deformylflustrabromine (Sala \net al., 2005), and a number of carbamates and piperidines (Albrecht et al., 2008, Springer \net al., 2008) have been discovered, their molecular mechanisms and functional effects on \nnative brain receptors are yet to be characterised. The difficulty to obtain \u03b14\u03b22*-selective \ncompounds is probably owing to the lack of selectivity against other heteromeric \nreceptors, especially the \u03b13\u03b24* receptors, which are predominantly expressed in \nganglionic neurones to mediate many off-target side effects of nicotinic ligands.  \n2087101, a (2-amino-5-keto)thiazole, has been shown to potentiate \u03b14\u03b22, \u03b17, \n\u03b14\u03b24 and \u03b12\u03b24, but not \u03b13\u03b24 or \u03b11-containing muscle nicotinic receptors in mammalian \ncell lines and Xenopus oocytes (Broad et al., 2006). On \u03b14\u03b22 receptors, up to 8 fold \npotentiation of the receptor current was observed at a low acetylcholine concentration. \nRecently, the allosteric binding site of 2087101 on \u03b17 receptors has been located to an \nintrasubunit cavity at the transmembrane region, providing a molecular basis for its \nallosteric action (Young et al., 2008). In the central nervous system where the expression \nof \u03b14\u03b24 and \u03b12\u03b24 is limited, 2087101 may show considerable selectivity for \u03b14\u03b22* and \n\u03b17 but not \u03b13\u03b24* nicotinic receptors. To define its potential clinical applications we \nexamined the effects of 2087101 on native \u03b14\u03b22*, \u03b17 and \u03b13\u03b24* nicotinic receptor-\nmediated processes in the rat brain. \n2. Materials and Methods \n 4\nAnimal tissues were prepared following procedures in compliance with the UK Animal \n(Scientific Procedure) Act 1986. \n \n2.1 Patch-clamp recordings in rat hippocampal neuronal culture \n \nPrimary cultures of hippocampal neurones were prepared from newborn (1- to 2-day \nold) Wistar rats (Harlan, UK) with modified procedures (Alkondon and Albuquerque, \n1993). The brains were removed following decapitation and hippocampi were rapidly \ndissected and cut for enzymatic digestion in PBS solution containing 0.5 mg\/ml papain \n(Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK) and 0.25 mg\/ml deoxyribonuclease (DNAse I, Sigma-\nAldrich, Poole, UK) for 20 min at 37oC. The papain solution was replaced with 2 ml \nDulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM, PAA Laboratories GmbH) supplemented \nwith 10% heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma), 10000 Units\/ml penicillin, \n10000 \u03bcg\/ml streptomycin, and 29.2 mg\/ml L-glutamine (PSG, Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). \nThe digested tissue was then gently triturated by suction using a sterile glass Pasteur \npipette with flamed tip. Dissociated cells were plated at a density of approximately 4x105 \ncells\/ml on glass cover slips pre-coated with poly-D-lysine and mouse laminin (Becton \nDickinson Biosciences, Oxford, UK), and maintained in an incubator (37oC and \nhumidified atmosphere of 95% O2 and 5% CO2) in serum-deprived medium containing B-\n27 supplement (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) to maintain neuronal survival. Between 5 and 9 \ndays in culture, 5 \u03bcM cytosine \u03b2-D-arabinofuranoside (AraC, Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK) \nwas supplemented to the medium to reduce the proliferation of non-neuronal cells. A \nheterogeneous population of hippocampal neurones was thus maintained for 4 weeks in \nculture. Neurones selected for patch-clamp recordings had somatic diameters of 15-30 \n\u03bcm, with neurite extensions.  \n \nWhole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were carried out 18-25 days after plating. \nDuring recordings, cells were continuously superfused (2 ml\/min) with extracellular \nsolution containing (in mM): NaCl 145, KCl 2, KH2PO4 1.18, HEPES 10, MgSO4 1.2, \nCaCl2 2, D-glucose 11, kynurenic acid 5 (glutamate receptor antagonist), atropine 0.1 \u03bcM \n(muscarinic ACh receptor antagonist) at room temperature (pH adjusted to 7.2 with \nNaOH). Recordings were carried out using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon \nInstruments, Foster City, CA, output cut-off frequency = 5 kHz) at holding potential (Vh) \nof +20 mV for GABAergic postsynaptic currents (PSCs). Signals were digitised every 50 \n\u03bcs and analysed off-line with PClamp8 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). \nPatch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (1.5 mm outer diameter, \nHarvard apparatus, UK), and had resistances between 5 and 7 M\u03a9 when filled with the \nintracellular solution containing (in mM): Cs2SO4 81, NaCl 4, MgSO4 2, CaCl2 0.02, \nBAPTA 0.1, D-glucose 15, HEPES 10, ATP 3, GTP 0.1, Na-phosphocreatine 5 (pH \nadjusted to 7.2 with CsOH). For the recording of somatic K+ current, K-gluconate (130 \nmM) was used instead of Cs2SO4 in pipettes, and 300 \u00b5M CdCl2 and 300 nM tetrodotoxin \n(TTX) were added to the extracellular solution to block voltage-gated Ca2+ and Na+ \nchannels, respectively. Series resistance of the recordings was monitored before and after \neach drug application, and recordings were excluded from analysis when series resistance \nchanged by more than 10%. Changes in amplitude, frequency and duration of PSCs were \nsummed by measuring the total charge transfer for a 20 s period from the onset of agonist \nperfusion. \n \n 5\nDrugs were diluted at their final concentration in the extracellular solution and \nnicotinic agonists were applied via a multibarrel pipette positioned 150 \u03bcm away from the \nrecorded neuron.  \n \n2.2 Electrophysiological recordings of neuronal firing in the ventral tegmental area \n \nCoronal midbrain slices (350 \u00b5m) containing the ventral tegmental area (VTA) \nfrom male Sprague-Dawley rats (25 - 30 days old) were prepared in ice-cold, oxygenated, \nartificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF), which contained (in mM) NaCl 123, NaH2CO3 22, \nNaH2PO4 1.25, KCl 3.75, D-Glucose 10, CaCl2 2.5 and MgSO4 1.2. During recording, \nslices were constantly superfused with oxygenated aCSF at a flow rate of 3 ml\/min at \n34oC. The VTA was visually identified as a grey area medial to the substantia nigra and \nthe medial lemniscus, a white fibre tract. Single cell extracellular recordings were made \nusing glass microelectrodes filled with aCSF (impedance of 3 - 6 M\u03a9). Action potentials \nwere recorded using an Axopatch 1D amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), \ndigitised using CED1401 plus (CED, Cambridge, UK) and captured and stored on a PC \nusing Spike 2 software (CED, Cambridge, UK). Recordings from single neurones \ndisplayed constant action potential amplitude and waveform. For details, see (Chen et al., \n2003).  \n \nSpontaneously firing neurones in the VTA were distinguished by both \nelectrophysiological and pharmacological characteristics (Grace and Onn, 1989, Johnson \nand North, 1992). The most frequently recorded neurones are the classically defined \ndopaminergic neurones, which fire spontaneous action potentials at a frequency ranging \nfrom 0.5 to 4 Hz and whose extracellular action potential waveform has large negative \nphase and 2.5\u20133 ms duration. The firing rate can be significantly suppressed by 50 \u00b5M \ndopamine. The other main type of VTA neurones exhibits shorter duration (~ 2 ms) action \npotentials at higher firing frequencies (4 \u2013 15 Hz). Dopamine does not inhibit the firing \nrate of these classically defined non-dopaminergic, GABAergic interneurones. The \nidentification of dopaminergic neurones by the electrophysiological and pharmacological \ncharacteristics has been challenged recently as projecting dopaminergic neurones in the \nVTA were found to exhibit more diverse electrophysiological and pharmacological \ncharacteristics (Margolis et al., 2006, Lammel et al., 2008). For the study of nicotinic \nmodulation of VTA neuron firing, we focused on the classically defined low-frequency \nfiring, putative dopaminergic neurones, which have been shown to have higher sensitivity \nto nicotine than the high-frequency firing, putative non-dopaminergic neurones (Yin and \nFrench, 2000). \n \nDrugs were dissolved in aCSF and delivered to the slice via a switch from control \naCSF. An initial recording period of > 4 min was usually allowed to establish the baseline \nfiring frequency of a neuron. Peak changes of frequency caused by drug application were \ncalculated using at least three consecutive 10 s bins containing 15 - 120 spikes. A washing \nperiod (> 20 min) was given between subsequent drug applications. The effect of \n2087101 was examined by comparing the effects of nicotine before and after the \napplication of 2087101 in the same neuron. \n \n2.3 [3H]Noradrenaline release from rat hippocampal slices \n \nHippocampi slices (150 \u03bcm) from 3 rats (male Lister-Hooded rats (250 \u2013 350 g) \nwere chopped using a McIlwain tissue chopper, each time rotating the tissue through 60\u00b0. \n 6\nSlices were dispersed in Krebs bicarbonate buffer (in mM): NaCl 118, KCl, 2.4, \nCaCl2.2H2O 2.4, KH2PO4 1.2; MgSO4.7H2O 1.2, NaHCO3 25,  glucose 10, ascorbic acid 1 \n(oxygenated with 5% CO2\/95% O2 for 1h), and then incubated with 10 \u03bcM pargyline, a \nmonoamine oxidase inhibitor, and incubated with [3H]noradrenaline (100 nM) for 30 min \nat 37\u00b0C (Dajas-Bailador et al., 2003, Barik and Wonnacott, 2006). Following loading, \nslices were washed with Krebs buffer containing 1 \u03bcM nomifensine (a monoamine uptake \ninhibitor) and 10 \u03bcM pargyline (Barik and Wonnacott, 2006). After washing, slices were \nloaded in each well of a 96-well GF\/C filter plate (Millipore), and 70 \u03bcl of buffer \u00b1 \nantagonist\/potentiator was added to each well for 5 minutes at 37\u00b0C. After this, buffer \ncontaining released radioactivity was removed by filtration into a 96-well collection plate. \nSlices were then stimulated for 5 min with buffer containing agonist (\u00b1 \nantagonist\/potentiator; 70 \u03bcl\/well), and the stimulating buffer was removed into another \n96-well collection plate. \n \nOptiphase Supermix (Wallac) scintillation fluid (170 \u03bcl) was added to each well of \nthe collection plates prior to being heat sealed and radioactivity quantified using a Wallac \n1450 Microbeta 96-well plate counter (Wallac Oy, Turku, Finland, counting efficiency \n25%). Radioactivity remaining in the slices was measured by digestion of the tissue in 0.2 \nml Solvable (Packard Biosciences) for 1 h followed by an addition of 0.5 ml isopropyl \nalcohol and 4.5 ml Hionic Fluor scintillation fluid (Packard Biosciences). Radioactivity \nwas then quantified using a Wallac 1410 scintillation counter (Wallac Oy, Turku, Finland, \ncounting efficiency 35%). \n \nRelease of [3H]noradrenaline was expressed as a fraction of the total radioactivity \ncontained within the slices at the time of stimulation. To compare the concentration-\ndependent effect of nicotine and the effect of 2087101, the release of [3H]noradrenaline \ninduced by different nicotine concentration before and during the addition of 2087101 \nwas normalised to that evoked by 100 \u03bcM nicotine. \n \n2.4 Reagents \n \nACh chloride, (-)-nicotine hydrogen tartrate (nicotine), mecamylamine, atropine \nsulfate, choline chloride, kynurenic acid, bicuculline methochloride, nomifensine, \npargyline and dopamine hydrochloride were from Sigma (Poole, Dorset, UK). Dihydro-\u03b2-\nerythroidine hydrobromide (DH\u03b2E) was from Sigma-RBI, and methyllycaconitine citrate \n(MLA), D-(-)-2-Amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (D-AP5), 6-Cyano-7-\nnitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) and (2S)-(+)-5,5-Dimethyl-2-morpholineacetic acid \n(SCH 50911) from Tocris Cookson Ltd (Bristol, UK). [7,8-3H]noradrenaline (8-15 \nCi\/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Amersham, Bucks, UK). 2087101 \nwas synthesised by Lilly Research Laboratories (courtesy of S. Holllinshead).

Results  \n3.1 Effects of 2087101 on nicotinic agonist induced postsynaptic currents in cultured \nhippocampal neurones. \n \nActivation of \u03b17 and non-\u03b17 nicotinic receptors in hippocampal neurones has been \nshown to stimulate somatodendritic currents (Alkondon and Albuquerque, 1993) and to \ninduce action potential-dependent GABA release, which was recorded as GABAA \nreceptor-mediated postsynaptic currents (PSCs) (Alkondon et al., 1999, Albuquerque et \nal., 2009). In our cultured hippocampal neurones, ACh induced somatodendritic current in \nthe presence of TTX, and the effect was completely inhibited by 10 nM MLA, showing a \npredominant \u03b17 receptor-mediated effect (Fig. 1A), which is in agreement with the low \nprevalence of non-\u03b17 heteromeric receptor-mediated somatodendritic currents shown \npreviously (Alkondon and Albuquerque, 1993, Hurst et al., 2005, Ng et al., 2007).  \n \nIn order to obtain both \u03b17 and \u03b14\u03b22* receptor-mediated responses by the same \nmechanism, we recorded ACh-induced PSCs (Fig. 1B) in the absence of TTX and at the \nholding potential (Vh) of +20 mV to minimise the amplitude of \u03b17-mediated \nsomatodendritic currents that show inward rectification (Alkondon et al., 1999). 1 mM \nkynurenic acid and 10 \u00b5M atropine were present continuously to pharmacologically block \nionotropic glutamate receptors and muscarinic ACh receptors. Under these conditions, the \nPSCs were sensitive to the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline, hence resulted from \npresynaptic GABA release (Alkondon et al., 1999). The \u03b17-selective agonist choline (10 \nmM) was able to induce PSCs in most cultured neurones (Fig. 1C top trace & D left trace) \nand the effects was inhibited by 10 nM MLA (Fig. 1C bottom trace), confirming the \npresence of an \u03b17 component. In the presence of 10 nM MLA to block the \u03b17 receptors, \nACh also evoked PSCs (Fig. 1F), showing a non-\u03b17 mediated component due to the \nactivation \u03b14\u03b22* receptors (Alkondon et al., 1999, Albuquerque et al., 2009). The overall \nACh-induced response was significantly inhibited by MLA at a higher concentration (100 \nnM)  (Fig. 1B, bottom trace) that inhibits both \u03b17 and non-\u03b17 receptors (Alkondon and \nAlbuquerque, 1993). We have therefore examined the effects of 2087101 on PSCs \ninduced by choline and ACh + MLA (10 nM) to activate the \u03b17 and the non- \u03b17, \u03b14\u03b22* \ncomponents separately. \n \nThe application of 2087101 (3 \u03bcM) caused no currents in hippocampal neurones on \nits own, but in the presence of 3 \u03bcM 2087101, the frequency and duration of PSCs \ninduced by both choline and ACh + MLA were enhanced in a reversible manner (Fig. 1D \nand F, middle and right traces). To quantify the changes in PSCs, total charge transfer for \na 20 s period was measured starting from the application of agonist (Alkondon et al., \n1999). By comparing to agonist-induced responses before the addition of 2087101 in each \nneuron, we found significantly enhanced agonist-evoked effects in the presence of \n2087101 (10 min) and the effect was washed out (Fig. 1E and G, * P < 0.05, One-way \nANOVA with Dunnett\u2019s posthoc test for multiple comparisons against the control). \nAveraged enhancements for choline and ACh + MLA induced responses were 247 \u00b1 14% \n(n = 5) and 235 \u00b1 27% of control (n = 6), respectively. The results show that 2087101 \nsignificantly potentiated agonist-induced \u03b17 and \u03b14\u03b22* receptor-mediated GABA release.  \n \n \n 8\nIn order to ascertain that 2087101 indeed potentiated nicotinic acetylcholine receptors \nbut not GABAA receptors to facilitate the PSCs, we examined its effect on postsynaptic \nGABAA receptors in hippocampal neurones. It is particularly important to examine this \npossible cross reactivity because the binding site for 2087101 on \u03b17 receptors has been \nshown to be a conserved allosteric site within the whole family of Cys-loop ligand-gated \nion channel receptors, which include both nicotinic and GABAA receptors (Hosie et al., \n2006, Young et al., 2008) \n \nUsing whole-cell patch clamp recordings at the Vh of +20 mV and in the presence \nof 10 \u00b5M SCH-50911, a GABAB receptor-selective antagonist, direct application of \nGABA (5 \u00b5M) induced an outward whole-cell current mediated by GABAA receptors. \nApplication of 2087101 (3 \u03bcM for 7 min) did not cause any whole-cell current by itself, \nnor any significant alteration of GABA-induced currents (P > 0.05, n = 5), showing a lack \nof direct activity of 2087101 on GABAA receptors.  \n \nWe have shown previously that 2087101 has no effect on voltage-gated Ca2+ or \nNa+ channels or ionotropic glutamate receptors in cultured cortical neurones (Broad et al., \n2006). We have now examined its effects on voltage-gated K+ channels, since their \nmodulation may indirectly affect GABA release. Outward currents were activated by a \ndepolarising voltage step from -70 to +20 mV using a K+-gluconate containing patch \npipette in the extracellular solution containing 300 \u00b5M CdCl2 and 300 nM TTX to block \nthe voltage-gated Ca2+ and Na+ channels, respectively. The application of 2087101 (3 \u03bcM \nfor 7 min) did not affect these voltage-gated K+ current (n = 5). Altogether, these \nexperiments show a lack of effects of 2087101 on either GABAA receptors or voltage-\ngated K+ channels, and thus further support the evidence of selective modulation of \u03b14\u03b22* \nand \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. \n \n3.2 Effects of 2087101 on nicotine-stimulated [3H]noradrenaline release in the \nhippocampus. \n \nIn contrast to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor mediated GABA release, \nnicotine-stimulated noradrenaline release in the hippocampus is not sensitive to the \u03b17 \nantagonist MLA or the \u03b22-preferring antagonist dihydro-\u03b2-erythroidine (DH\u03b2E), but is \npartially inhibited by the \u03b13-preferring antagonist \u03b1-conotoxin AuIB (Clarke and Reuben, \n1996, Luo et al., 1998), so that \u03b13\u03b24* receptors could be the main subtype mediating this \nprocess (Vizi and Kiss, 1998). Because 2087101 has been shown to have no allosteric \neffect on recombinant \u03b13\u03b24 receptors (Broad et al., 2006), we examined its effect on \nnicotine-stimulated [3H]noradrenaline release in rat hippocampal slices. \n \nNicotine caused a concentration-dependent increase of fractional \n[3H]noradrenaline release (Fig. 2 filled circles) with an EC50 of 5.8 \u03bcM, which is very \nsimilar to that reported for nicotine-induced [3H]noradrenaline release from synaptosomes \n(6.5 \u03bcM) (Clarke and Reuben, 1996). The non-competitive nicotinic antagonist \nmecamylamine (MEC, 10 \u00b5M, n = 6,), but not DH\u03b2E (2 \u00b5M, n = 6), blocked nicotine-\ninduced [3H]noradrenaline release, in agreement with the notion that \u03b13\u03b24*, but not \n\u03b14\u03b22*, receptors are the predominant subtype in this process (Vizi and Kiss, 1998).  \n \n 9\nApplication of 3 \u00b5M 2087101 alone did not induce any [3H]noradrenaline release \nin hippocampal slices. In the presence of the potentiator, nicotine-induced concentration-\ndependent release (Fig. 2 open circles) was found similar to that of nicotine alone (EC50: \n4.2 \u03bcM versus 5.8 \u03bcM, and EMax: 94.0 \u00b1 7.9 % versus 99.5 \u00b1 4.1 %, n = 6 each). \nMecamylamine (10 \u00b5M) also blocked the effects of nicotine + 2087101 (Fig. 2 open \ndiamond). Two-way ANOVA analysis of the two curves showed significant (F[10, 110] = \n51.2, P < 0.001) concentration-dependent effects of nicotine, but no significant effect of \n2087101 (F[1, 110] = 0.12, P > 0.05).  \n \nThe nicotine concentration-response curves were fitted by a one-site sigmoidal \nequation, showing no evidence for a low affinity \u03b17 component that was shown \npreviously to be activated by choline or anatoxin in hippocampal slices (Barik and \nWonnacott, 2006). The lack of significant effect of 2087101 on nicotine-induced \n[3H]noradrenaline release thereby agrees with its lack of effect on \u03b13\u03b24 receptors.  \n \n \n3.3 Effects of 2087101 on nicotine-stimulated neuronal firing in the VTA. \n \nThe spontaneous firing activity of midbrain dopamine neurones in rat brain slices \ncan be enhanced by submicromolar concentrations of nicotine via the activation of \u03b22* \nnicotinic receptors (Picciotto et al., 1998), which may include the \u03b14\u03b22, \u03b16\u03b22, \u03b14\u03b15\u03b22 \nand \u03b14\u03b16\u03b22\u03b23 subtypes in the VTA (Klink et al., 2001, Champtiaux et al., 2003). Albeit \nat a lower density, \u03b17 receptors are also expressed in the VTA at pre- and postsynaptic \nlocations to modulate glutamate release and somatodendritic currents (Mansvelder and \nMcGehee, 2000, Klink et al., 2001). Given the essential role of nicotinic receptors in the \nVTA for nicotine re-enforcement, we examined whether 2087101 can enhance nicotine-\nstimulated neuronal firing activity in rat brain slices. \n \nBath-applied nicotine at 0.3 \u00b5M significantly increased the firing rate of the \nputative dopamine neurones by 46.4 \u00b1 4.4% from baseline (mean baseline  firing \nfrequency = 1.9 \u00b1 0.1 Hz, range 0.7 \u2013 3.5 Hz, n = 61, Fig. 3A). The effect of nicotine was \nconcentration-dependent with 0.3 \u00b5M nicotine producing a sub-maximal effect (Fig. 3B). \nIn contrast, the firing frequency of the putative non-dopamine neurones was much less \nsensitive to bath-applied nicotine, where 1 \u00b5M nicotine caused no significant firing rate \nincrease (1.4 \u00b1 1.4%, baseline frequency = 6.7 \u00b1 0.7 Hz, range 5.4 \u2013 8.4 Hz, n = 4), in \nagreement with a previous finding (Yin and French, 2000). Subsequently, we examined \nthe effect of 2087101 on nicotine-stimulated firing rate increase in the putative dopamine \nneurones. \n \nRepeated applications of 0.3 \u00b5M nicotine with a 20 min washing period in-\nbetween produced identical increases in firing rate in dopamine neurones (44.3 \u00b1 7.6 % \nvs. 45.4 \u00b1 7.3 %, n = 9, P = 0.5, paired t-test, Fig. 3A). Pre-application (10 min) of 10 \u00b5M \n2087101 before the second application of nicotine significantly enhanced the response by \n29 \u00b1 11% compared to the control nicotine response (n = 10, * P < 0.05, paired t-test, Fig. \n3C). However, the effect of 3 \u00b5M 2087101 was not statistically significant (P > 0.05, n = \n16, paired t-test). Fig. 3D shows the % enhancement of 0.3 \u00b5M nicotine-stimulated \nresponse by 0, 3 and 10 \u00b5M 2087101. The nicotinic potentiator can thus concentration-\ndependently facilitate the effect of nicotine on dopamine neurones in the VTA. \n \n 10\n2087101 (at 3 and 10 \u00b5M) had no significant effects on baseline firing rate (2.2 \u00b1 \n1.6 % change, n = 27, see Fig. 3C), or action potential waveform (data not shown), \nshowing no direct activation of nicotinic receptors or other receptors\/channels. The \npotential nicotinic receptor subtypes activated by 0.3 \u00b5M nicotine was examined using \nnicotinic antagonists. DH\u03b2E (2 \u00b5M) significantly inhibited the response (91 \u00b1 5% \ninhibition, n = 3, Fig. 3E), but \u03b1-conotoxin MII (CTX, 100 nM, an \u03b16 antagonist) or MLA \n(10 nM, an \u03b17 antagonist) had no significant effects (14 \u00b1 8 % inhibition, n = 4 and 4.8 \u00b1 \n2.1% inhibition, n = 3, respectively, Fig. 3E), suggesting a major role for the \u03b14\u03b22* \nreceptors under the experimental conditions. The effect of 2087101 could therefore be \ncaused by potentiation of \u03b14\u03b22* receptors in the VTA. \n \nBecause the excitatory effect of nicotine could arise not only directly from the \nactivation of somatodendritic nicotinic receptors, but also indirectly from the release of \nexcitatory neurotransmitters glutamate or ACh, we examined the effects of glutamate \nreceptor antagonists (50 \u00b5M D-AP5, an NMDA receptor antagonist, and 20 \u00b5M CNQX, \nan AMPA receptor antagonist, n = 3) and the muscarinic ACh receptor antagonist \natropine (1 \u00b5M, n = 4). The antagonists had no significant effect on 0.3 \u00b5M nicotine-\ninduced response or the basal spontaneous firing rate. The result is in support of a direct \nsomatodendritic effect by nicotine, in agreement with the effect by a \u03b14\u03b22-selective \nagonist TC-2559 shown by us previously (Chen et al., 2003).  \n \n(Figure 3 near here) \n \n4. Discussion  \n \nWe showed that the nicotinic allosteric modulator 2087101 significantly facilitated \nnicotinic stimulation of GABA release in the hippocampus and dopamine neuron firing in \nthe VTA, but it had no effect on nicotine-induced noradrenaline release in the \nhippocampus. The differential facilitation of these nicotinic processes agrees with its \nselectivity for different receptor subtypes (Broad et al., 2006). Based on the present \nknowledge of native nicotinic receptor subunit compositions, our results suggest that \n2087101 is active on neuronal processes mediated by \u03b14\u03b22* and \u03b17, but not \u03b13\u03b24* \nnicotinic receptors. The selectivity profile of 2087101 on recombinant receptors therefore \ntranslates very well to native nicotinic receptor subtypes.  \n \nThe activity of 2087101 on native \u03b17 receptors has been clearly demonstrated in \nhippocampal neurones. The \u03b17 receptor selective agonist choline (Alkondon et al., 1999) \nwas used to induce GABAergic PSCs, and the process was enhanced by ~1.5 fold by \n2087101, without any effect on GABAA receptors, demonstrating unequivocally the \npotentiator\u2019s activity on native \u03b17 receptors. Restricted by the lack of subtype selective \nagonists and antagonists for heteromeric nicotinic receptors (Albuquerque et al., 2009), \nwe examined the effects of 2087101 on non-\u03b17 nicotinic receptor-mediated hippocampal \nGABA release using ACh in the presence of MLA, an \u03b17-selective antagonist. This \nprocess was also enhanced by 2087101. As the non-\u03b17 component of hippocampal \nGABA release was shown to be mainly mediated by \u03b14\u03b22* nicotinic receptors (Alkondon \net al., 1999) and amongst those 80% were identified to be of the \u03b14\u03b22 composition \n(McClure-Begley et al., 2009), 2087101 may have therefore potentiated the hippocampal \n\u03b14\u03b22 receptors.  \n 11\nAlthough the subunit composition has yet to be confirmed at the molecular level, \nnicotine-induced hippocampal [3H]noradrenaline release has been proposed to be \nmediated by (non-\u03b17, non-\u03b14\u03b22) \u03b13\u03b24* nicotinic receptors (Vizi and Kiss, 1998), with \nthe pharmacological characteristics very similar to those recently identified \u03b13\u03b24* \nreceptors expressed in the habenulo-interpeduncular pathway mediating ACh release \n(Grady et al., 2009). 2087101 was, however, not able to potentiate nicotine-induced \n[3H]noradrenaline release, a finding in agreement with its lack of activity on recombinant \n\u03b13\u03b24 receptors in heterologous expression systems (Broad et al., 2006). These differential \neffects of 2087101 on hippocampal GABA and noradrenaline release have therefore \nsuggested its selectivity for native \u03b14\u03b22* and \u03b17, but not \u03b13\u03b24* receptors. \n \nWe have also further demonstrated the activity of 2087101 on nicotinic receptors \nin the VTA. The stimulatory effect of 0.3 \u00b5M nicotine on putative dopamine neurones \nwas significantly enhanced by 2087101. The nicotinic receptor subtypes underlying the \neffect were investigated using antagonists. DH\u03b2E, but not MLA or \u03b1-conotoxin MII, \nproduced significant inhibition, suggesting the activation of \u03b14\u03b22* receptor subtypes, the \npredominant subtype in the VTA (Zoli et al., 1998, Klink et al., 2001, Champtiaux et al., \n2003). The lack of a significant contribution by \u03b17 receptors could be explained by the \nrelatively low density of \u03b17 receptors in the brain area (Zoli et al., 1998). Although \nnicotine can stimulate glutamate release via presynaptic \u03b17 receptors and increased the \nfrequency of excitatory postsynaptic currents in postsynaptic neurones (Mansvelder et al., \n2000), we found that the block of glutamatergic transmission had no influence on \nnicotine-stimulated firing rate increase. The increased glutamate release may therefore \nhave negligible effect on the firing rate of putative dopamine neurones when compared \nwith the direct somatodendritic depolarisation induced by nicotine. It is also noted that a \nslightly higher concentration of 2087101 is required to significantly facilitate nicotine-\ninduced dopamine neuron firing rate increase. It may be speculated that the incorporation \nof additional subunits, i.e. \u03b15 and \u03b23, by the \u03b14\u03b22* nicotinic receptors in the VTA (Zoli \net al., 1998, Klink et al., 2001, Champtiaux et al., 2003) may reduce the potency of \n2087101. \n \nReceptor subunit composition could indeed influence the potency and\/or efficacy \nof allosteric modulators. Several intrasubunit (Curtis et al., 2002) and intersubunit sites \n(Hansen and Taylor, 2007) have been identified on \u03b14\u03b22 receptors that were shown to \nspecifically interact with certain allosteric modulators. The allosteric binding site of \n2087101 on \u03b17 receptors was identified as an intrasubunit hydrophobic cavity (Young et \nal., 2008). As this binding site is a conserved allosteric site present in various members of \nthe family of cys-loop ligand-gated ion channels receptors (Young et al., 2008), it is \npossible to envisage a corresponding allosteric site on the \u03b14 subunit. However, the lack \nof activity on \u03b13\u03b24 receptors in heterologous expression systems (Broad et al., 2006) and \nin the rat hippocampus may suggest that the modulator does not bind the \u03b13 subunit.  \n \nThe ability of 2087101 to enhance GABAergic activity could be beneficial for \nmany severe neurological disorders, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease and schizophrenia \n(Freedman et al., 2000, Perry et al., 2000). Indeed, the \u03b17-selective potentiators were also \nshown to facilitate GABA release in the hippocampus to normalise sensory gating deficits \nin animal models (Hurst et al., 2005) and to improve cognitive functions in behavioural \nparadigms (Ng et al., 2007, Timmermann et al., 2007). An \u03b17 and \u03b14\u03b22 dual potentiator \nmay thus not only enhance \u03b17-mediated GABA release but also \u03b14\u03b22-mediated effects. \n 12\nThe latter may be particularly beneficial to schizophrenia patients, because the \u03b17 \nreceptor expression and functions are significantly reduced in this disorder (Freedman et \nal., 2000). GABA release in many brain regions has been shown to be predominantly \nmodulated by both \u03b17 and \u03b14\u03b22* receptors (Albuquerque et al., 2009), so that 2087101 \nand similar compounds could exert significant concurrent activity across many brain areas \nto offer better therapeutic potencies for some indications than subtype-selective allosteric \npotentiators. \n \nThe dual facilitation of both the GABAergic and dopaminergic systems may also \nameliorate cognitive and psychiatric deficits. Dopaminergic transmission in the brain is \nknown to modulate cognitive and reward processes as well as neuropsychiatric symptoms \n(Wise, 2004). A synergy between GABAergic and dopaminergic systems may thus be \nexplored for cognitive enhancement. \n \nThis in vitro demonstration of the potentiator activity may encourage future in vivo \nbehavioural evaluations for its therapeutic potentials. Because of its lack of activity on \nacetylcholinesterase (Broad et al., 2006) or \u03b13\u03b24* receptors, 2087101 may show a much \nimproved side effect profile compared to galantamine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor \nand a non-selective nicotinic receptor allosteric modulator, which is used clinically for the \nsymptomatic treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.  \n \nIn summary, the nicotinic positive allosteric modulator, 2087101, significantly \npotentiated native nicotinic processes mediated by \u03b14\u03b22* and \u03b17, but not \u03b13\u03b24* nicotinic \nreceptors. The selectivity profile of 2087101 may be further explored to differentiate the \nallosteric binding sites between heteromeric receptors. In addition, this potentiator can be \nused to further evaluate the therapeutic potential of concurrent enhancement of both \u03b17 \nand \u03b14\u03b22*-mediated nicotinic processes in the brain for the improvements of cognitive, \nmotor and reward functions.  \n \n5.

Acetylcholine (ACh, 1mM) in the presence 1 \u00b5M TTX induced \nsomatodendritic current (top trace) and the effect was inhibited by 10 nM MLA, a \u03b17 \nselective antagonist (bottom trace). B. ACh in the absence of TTX induced postsynaptic \ncurrents (PSCs), which were recorded as outward current at a holding potential of +20 \nmV to minimise the amplitude of somatodendritic current as it inward rectifies (top trace). \nACh-induced PSCs were inhibited by MLA at the high concentration of 100 nM, which \nantagonised both \u03b17 and non-\u03b17 nicotinic components (bottom trace). C. The \u03b17-\nselective agonist choline (10 mM) induced PSCs (top trace) that were sensitive to 10 nM \nMLA (bottom trace). Choline (D) and ACh in the presence of 10 nM MLA (ACh + MLA) \n(F) induced PSCs in the control aCSF (left traces), during the 10 min application of \n2087101 (3 \u00b5M, middle traces) and after washing out (right traces). Filled horizontal bars \nindicating agonist application periods and the open horizontal bars show the presence of 3 \n\u03bcM 2087101. During the experiments, agonists were applied every two minutes. Changes \nin PSC frequency and duration were measured by total charge transfer for a 20 s period \nfrom the start of each agonist application and the values were normalised to agonist\u2019s \neffect prior to the addition of 2087101 in each experiment. Averaged time courses for the \neffects of 2087101 on PSCs induced by 10 mM choline (E, n = 5) or 1 mM ACh + 10 nM \nMLA (G, n = 6) are shown. During the application of 2087101 (marked as a grey \nshadowed area), significant increases of agonist-induced PSCs were found (*P < 0.05, \nOne-way ANOVA with Dunnett\u2019s posthoc test), and recovery was seen during the \nwashing out of 2087101. 1 mM kynurenic acid and 10 \u00b5M atropine were present in the \naCSF throughout the experiments. PSCs were recorded at the holding potential of +20 \nmV. Values are shown as mean \u00b1 S.E.M. \n \nFig. 2. Nicotine-induced concentration-dependent [3H]noradrenaline release in  rat \nhippocampal slices in the presence (open circles, Nic + 2087101) and absence (filled \ncircles, Nic) of 3 \u001fM 2087101. Fractional release of preloaded [3H]noradrenaline (mean \n\u00b1 S.E.M from 6 independent experiments) was measured following 5 min application of \nnicotine with or without 2087101 in 96-well plates. The concentration-response curves \nwere fitted to a one-site sigmoidal equation and the EC50 for nicotine + 2087101 and \nnicotine alone were obtained at 4.2 \u03bcM (LogEC50 = -6.63 \u00b1 0.16 M) and 5.8 \u03bcM \n(LogEC50 = -6.77 \u00b1 0.07 M), respectively. Maximal fractional release relative to that \ninduced by 100 \u03bcM nicotine were found at 99.5 \u00b1 4.1 % for nicotine and 94.0 \u00b1 7.9 % for \nnicotine + 2087101. No statistical difference was found for the effect of 2087101 (P > \n0.05), although there was a significant effect for nicotine concentration (P < 0.05, Two-\nway ANOVA). Mecamylamine (MEC) at 10 \u00b5M completely inhibited 100 \u00b5M nicotine-\ninduced release in the presence and absence of 2087101 (diamond). Data points are mean \n\u00b1 S.E.M. \n 16\n \nFig. 3 2087101 enhanced nicotine-induced firing rate increase of putative dopamine \nneurones in the VTA in rat brain slices. A. Bath applications of 0.3 \u00b5M nicotine (filled \nhorizontal bars) increased the spontaneous firing rate of dopamine neurones. Firing \nfrequencies were calculated from the number of spikes in three 10s bins before and after \nnicotine application in the rate histogram.  B. A plot of nicotine-induced % increases of \nfiring rates at the indicated concentrations shows that 0.3 \u00b5M nicotine elicited sub-\nmaximal effects on firing frequency. C. The presence of 10 \u00b5M 2087101 (open bar) \nenhanced nicotine (filled bars)-induced firing frequency increase without causing any \neffect on its own. D. % changes from paired control applications of nicotine in the \npresence 0, 3 and 10 \u00b5M 2087101 are shown. * P < 0.05 indicates significantly enhanced \nnicotine-induced firing rate increase in the presence of 10 \u00b5M 2087101. E. % inhibition \ncaused by nicotinic receptor antagonists dihydro-beta-erythroidine (DH\u03b2E), \u03b1-conotoxin \nMII (CTX) and methyllycaconitine (MLA) on 0.3 \u00b5M nicotine induced response. All \nvalues are presented as mean \u00b1 S.E.M. \n \nAcknowledgement.
