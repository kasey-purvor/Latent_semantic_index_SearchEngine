Six of the structures {(3Z)-3-(1H-pyrrol-\n2-ylmethylidene)-1H-indol-2(3H)-one, C13H10N2O, (2a); (3Z)-\n3-(2-thienylmethylidene)-1H-indol-2(3H)-one, C13H9NOS,\n(2b); (3E)-3-(2-furylmethylidene)-1H-indol-2(3H)-one mono-\nhydrate, C13H9NO2\u0002H2O, (3a); 3-(1-methylethylidene)-1H-\nindol-2(3H)-one, C11H11NO, (4a); 3-cyclohexylidene-1H-\nindol-2(3H)-one, C14H15NO, (4c); and spiro[1,3-dioxane-2,3\n0-\nindolin]-20-one, C11H11NO3, (5)} display, as expected, inter-\nmolecular hydrogen bonding (N\u2014H\u0002 \u0002 \u0002O C) between the\n1H-indol-2(3H)-one units. However, methyl 3-(1-methylethyl-\nidene)-2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indole-1-carboxylate, C13H13N-\nO3, (4b), a carbamate analogue of (4a) lacking an N\u2014H\nbond, displays no intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The\nstructure of (4a) contains three molecules in the asymmetric\nunit, while (4b) and (4c) both contain two independent\nmolecules.\nComment\nConformational restriction is a useful tactic employed in\nmedicinal chemistry, which often leads to an improvement in\nthe biological properties of a molecule by reducing entropy\nand contributing to enhanced binding to a receptor or enzyme.\nThis extends to the presence of a conformational blocker, such\nas an ortho-substituent in biphenyl derivatives, which hinders\nfree rotation, or a strong hydrogen bond to \u2018lock\u2019 two groups\ntogether into a favourable binding orientation. A strategically\nplaced double bond (E or Z isomer) in the molecule also falls\nwithin this category, since it can drastically affect the activity\nor affinity of ligands binding to enzymes or receptors (Patrick,\n2009; King, 2002). Sunitinib, (1), is a conformationally\nrestricted clinically approved MRTKI (multi-receptor tyrosine\nkinase inhibitor) anticancer drug, combining a 1H-indol-\n2(3H)-one (oxindole) core with a Z-substituted 3-(1H-pyrrol-\n2-ylmethylidene) side chain (Fig. 1; Atkins et al., 2006). The\npyrrole NH group in (1) forms an intramolecular hydrogen\nbond with the oxindole carbonyl group, evidenced in solution,\nby 1H NMR spectroscopy, and in the cocrystal structure of (1)\nbound to an RTK (receptor tyrosine kinase) (Mohammadi\net al., 1997). Compound (2a), a lead molecule in the design of\n(1), exhibits biological activity towards kinases [IC50 =\n0.39 mM, PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor)], whereas\nthe 1-methylpyrrole analogue (E)-(3b) exhibits drastically\nreduced biological activity (IC50 > 100 mM) towards PDGF\n(Sun et al., 1998; Boiadjiev & Lightner, 2003).\nGiven the strong correlation between stereochemistry and\nkinase inhibitory action within this series of molecules, we\nhave undertaken a structural study of oxindole analogues in\nthe solid phase to complement the extensive prior studies\nundertaken in solution (Sun et al., 1998). Our investigation of\ncompounds (2)\u2013(4) by Raman and FT\u2013IR spectroscopy\n(Spencer et al., 2010), supported by theoretical calculations\n(Kausar et al., 2009; Bell et al., 2007), has been facilitated by\nstructure determinations from single-crystal X-ray diffraction\nanalysis, reported here. The molecules selected for this study\ncan be subdivided into several categories:\n(i) heterocycle-substituted analogues (2), found to exist\nexclusively as the Z isomer in solution;\n(ii) heterocycle-substituted analogues (3), found to exist\nexclusively as the E isomer in solution;\n(iii) simple symmetrically substituted analogues (4) and (5),\nobtained in order to provide a fingerprint region for the FT\u2013\nIR and Raman studies, especially (4a), given that the parent\nmethylidene compound (4d) is reported to be unstable in\nsolution (Rossiter, 2002).\nAnalogues (2)\u2013(4) were synthesized by a standard Knoe-\nvenagel condensation of oxindole with a variety of aldehydes\norganic compounds\nActa Cryst.

Compound (5) was\npurchased from Maybridge Chemicals. Crystals of (2a), (2b),\n(3a), (4a)\u2013(4c) and (5), of suitable quality for analysis by\nsingle-crystal X-ray diffraction, were grown from dichloro-\nmethane\/hexane. The molecular structures are shown in Figs.\n2\u20138, while selected bond lengths and angles are given in\nTable 1. The structure of (5) determined at room temperature\nhas been published previously (De & Kitagawa, 1991). The\ngeometry of the structure reported here, determined at 120 K,\ncorresponds very closely with that of the previously reported\nstructure.\nIn the following discussion, atom Xy refers also to X100+y\nand X200+y in structures where Z0 is greater than 1 [(4a)\u2013\n(4c)].\nThe geometry of the oxindole portion of the molecules is\ngenerally very similar for all seven structures, and compares\nclosely with oxindole fragments found in a search of the\nCambridge Structural Database (CSD, Version 5.30 with\nNovember 2008 and February 2009 updates; Allen, 2002).\nHowever, the only structure in which atom N1 is substituted,\n(4b), displays significantly longer N1\u2014C1 and N1\u2014C4\ndistances, a shorter O1\u2014C1 distance and a smaller C1\u2014N1\u2014\nC4 angle compared with the other six structures (Table 1).\nAlso, the only structure in which atom C2 is sp3 hybridized,\n(5), displays significantly longer C1\u2014C2 and C2\u2014C3 bond\nlengths compared with the other six structures.\nBy comparing the six structures in which atom C2 is sp2\nhybridized, we have observed differences in the heterocycle-\nsubstituted analogues (2a), (2b) and (3a), where atom C10 is\nsp2 hybridized, compared with structures (4a), (4b) and (4c),\nwhere atom C10 is sp3 hybridized. It is interesting to note that,\nwhile structures (2a), (2b) and (3a) are all in the orthorhombic\ncrystal system and have just one molecule in the asymmetric\nunit (Z0 = 1), the remaining structures all occupy lower-\nsymmetry crystal systems and have Z0 > 1 [Z0 = 3 for (4a), and\nZ0 = 2 for (4b) and (4c)].

However, a search of the CSD revealed that this trend\nis not observed in all substituted oxindoles and we must thus\nconclude that the fact that (4a)\u2013(4c) have Z0 > 1 is based on a\nnumber of different factors.\nIn addition to the more obvious geometric differences\nbetween the heterocycle-substituted analogues and structures\n(4a), (4b) and (4c), it is found that the average C1\u2014C2 bond\ndistance in (4a) and (4c) [1.509 (2) A\u02da] is significantly longer\nthan that in (2a), (2b) and (3a) [1.488 (2) A\u02da], while in (4b) (in\nwhich atom N1 is substituted) it is only slightly longer at\n1.490 (8) A\u02da. In the heterocycle-substituted oxindoles deter-\nmined by Boiadjiev & Lightner (2003), the average of the\nequivalent of the C1\u2014C2 bond distance is 1.474 (3) A\u02da, shorter\nthan in any of the seven structures reported here. In turn, the\naverage of the equivalent distance to N1\u2014C1 reported by\nBoiadjiev & Lightner is somewhat longer [1.372 (3) A\u02da] than\nthe average for (2a), (2b), (3a), (4a), (4c) and (5) [1.359 (5) A\u02da].\nIt is postulated that these differences arise from the differing\ntemperatures at which the single-crystal X-ray data sets were\ncollected, 298 K for the Boiadjiev & Lightner structures and\n120 K for those reported here.\nThe solid-state structures agree with the results from solu-\ntion NMR studies (see supplementary information) in that\nstructures (2a) and (2b) exist as Z isomers [average C1\u2014C2\u2014\nC9 bond angle = 128.6 (2)\u0004], while (3a) exists as the E isomer\n[C1\u2014C2\u2014C9 = 118.9 (2)\u0004]. These angles compare well with\nthe equivalent angles in the Z and E isomers reported by\nBoiadjiev & Lightner (2003), 128.3 (3) and 117.5 (5)\u0004,\nrespectively. The formation of the Z isomers in (2a) and (2b)\ncan be attributed to intramolecular N\u2014H\u0002 \u0002 \u0002O [in 2a)] and\norganic compounds\nActa Cryst. (2010).

By contrast, the E isomer reported by Boiadjiev\n& Lightner (2003) has no suitable groups with which to form\nintramolecular interactions and the molecule is much more\ntwisted than in the structures reported here, with the angle\nbetween the planes through the oxindole and substituent\nportions being approximately 30\u0004 (cf. Table S3). In (4c), the\nformation of weak intramolecular C\u2014H\u0002 \u0002 \u0002O interactions\ninvolving atoms C14 and C114 (Table 3) corresponds with an\naverage C1\u2014C2\u2014C9\u2014C10 torsion angle which is relatively\nclose to 180\u0004 (Table 1). It seems that the formation of even\nweak C\u2014H\u0002 \u0002 \u0002O interactions has a significant effect on the\nconformation of these molecules in the solid state.\nStructures (2a), (2b), (3a), (4a), (4c) and (5) are also\naffected by the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds\ninvolving the oxindole N\u2014H and C O units, which leads to\nthe formation of molecular dimers in every case (Fig. 9\u201311,\nFigs. S1\u2013S4 in the supplementary information, and Table 2).\nThe hydrogen-bonding motif leading to the formation of the\nmolecular dimers can be described as an R22(8) ring (Etter et\nal., 1990). Analysis of Fig. 11 shows that, while the dimers\nformed in (3a), (4a) and (4c) are fairly planar [not taking into\naccount the conformation of the cyclohexyl rings in (4c)], the\nmolecules forming the dimers in (2a), (2b) and (5) are quite\nstaggered with respect to one another. This is borne out by\nanalysis of the N\u2014H\u0002 \u0002 \u0002O hydrogen-bond angles (Table 2).\nWhile the average for the interactions in (2a), (2b) and (5) is\n163 (3)\u0004, the average for those in (3a), (4a) and (4c) is\nsignificantly larger at 172 (3)\u0004.\nStructure (3a) is the only one of the seven to incorporate a\nmolecule of solvent in the crystal structure. This water mol-\necule is involved in hydrogen bonding both to the oxindole\nC O group and to other water molecules (Fig. 9 and Table 2).\nThe molecular dimers in this structure are connected with one\nanother via \u0002\u2013\u0002 stacking interactions (Hunter & Sanders,\n1990), the parallel dimer planes being separated by 3.3 A\u02da,\nwhile atom O1 and the N1\/C1\u2013C4 ring form a lone-pair\u2013\u0002\ninteraction (Mooibroek et al., 2008) (O1\u0002 \u0002 \u0002ring centroid =\norganic compounds\no74 Spencer et al. \u0003 C13H10N2O and six related compounds Acta Cryst.

This stacking of\ndimers leads to the formation of columns along the (010)\ndirection which are connected to one another in the (100)\ndirection via hydrogen bonding with the water molecules\n(Fig. 12).\nThe delocalized bonding and planar nature of these mol-\necules mean that the other six structures also exhibit varying\ndegrees of \u0002\u2013\u0002 stacking interactions, with interplanar\ndistances ranging from 3.1 A\u02da in (4c) to approximately 3.6 A\u02da in\n(2b) (Figs. S5\u2013S10 in the supplementary information).\nIn conclusion, the X-ray single-crystal structure determi-\nnations described here have brought to light a number of\ninteresting properties in oxindoles in the solid phase, including\nhigh Z0 values and inter- and intramolecular hydrogen\nbonding. This offers the potential for synthesizing oxindoles\nwith extended molecular architectures and biological proper-\nties (Spencer et al., 2009) and will be of continuing invaluable\nassistance to theoretical calculations (Kausar et al., 2009).\nExperimental\nThe starting materials for the syntheses of the title compounds were\npurchased from commercial sources (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, Fisher,\nFluorochem and Frontier Scientific) and were used without further\npurification. All reactions were carried out in air, and commercial\ngrade solvents and materials were used except where specified.\nElemental analyses were performed on a CE Instruments Eager 300\napparatus. Crystals of each of compounds (2a)\u2013(5) of sufficient\nquality for X-ray diffraction analysis were obtained by the diffusion\nof hexane into a CH2Cl2 solution.\nSynthetic and purification procedure for (2a). 1,3-Dihydro-2H-\nindol-2-one (oxindole) (0.319 g, 2.40 mmol) and 1H-pyrrole-2-\ncarbaldehyde (0.190 g, 2.00 mmol) were added to EtOH (5 ml) with\n2\u20133 drops of piperidine as a catalyst. The reaction mixture was\nrefluxed until complete according to thin-layer chromatographic\n(TLC) monitoring, which equates to approximately 3 h. The reaction\nmixture was cooled to room temperature and, on further cooling with\nice, afforded a precipitate. The crude product was obtained by\nfiltration and washed with cold EtOH. Product (2a) was purified by\ncolumn chromatography on silica with chloroform\u2013methanol (90:10\nv\/v) as eluant. Crystals of (2a) were obtained as a yellow solid (yield\n0.420 g, 84%; m.p. 483\u2013486 K).

Oxindole (0.133 g,\n1.00 mmol) and thiophene-2-carbaldehyde (0.159 g, 1.20 mmol) were\nreacted, and purification was achieved as for (2a), except that\nhexane\u2013ethyl acetate (50:50 v\/v) was used as eluant during chroma-\ntographic purification.

In structure (4a), the R factor is a little high\n(7.9%). All other indicators of structural quality are good and there is\nno indication of any twinning or disorder in the structure.
