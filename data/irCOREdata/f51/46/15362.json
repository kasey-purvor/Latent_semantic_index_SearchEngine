Many mathematicians and curriculum bodies have argued in favour of the theory\nof formal discipline: that studying advanced mathematics develops one\u2019s ability to reason\nlogically. In this paper we explore this view by directly comparing the inferences drawn\nfrom abstract conditional statements by advanced mathematics students and well-educated\narts students. The mathematics students in the study were found to endorse fewer invalid\nconditional inferences than the arts students, but they did not endorse significantly more valid\ninferences. We establish that both groups tended to endorse more inferences which led to\nnegated conclusions than inferences which led to affirmative conclusions (a phenomenon\nknown as the negative conclusion effect). In contrast, however, we demonstrate that, unlike\nthe arts students, the mathematics students did not exhibit the affirmative premise effect: the\ntendency to endorse more inferences with affirmative premises than with negated premises. We\nspeculate that this latter result may be due to an increased ability for successful mathematics\nstudents to be able to \u2018see through\u2019 opaque representations. Overall, our data are consistent\nwith a version of the formal discipline view. However, there are important caveats; in partic-\nular, we demonstrate that there is no simplistic relationship between the study of advanced\nmathematics and conditional inference behaviour.\nKeywords: advanced mathematical thinking, conditional inference, logic, reasoning, repre-\nsentation systems, theory of formal discipline\nOne of the original rationales for placing mathematics at the heart of the\nschool curriculum was the idea that studying mathematics develops one\u2019s\nabstract logical thinking skills (e.g. Davis, 1970). This is a variant of what\nThorndike (1924) called the Theory of Formal Discipline, the idea that the\nstudy of certain disciplines benefits reasoning generally. Oakley (1946) typ-\nified this view, writing that \u201cthe study of mathematics cannot be replaced by\nany other activity that will train and develop man\u2019s purely logical faculties to\nthe same level of rationality.\u201d (p.19). Similar views are still widespread today:\nwhen discussing the utility of studying undergraduate level mathematics, the\nQAA (2002) \u2013 the UK quality assurance agency for higher education \u2013 stated\nthat \u201c[mathematics] graduates are rightly seen as possessing considerable\nskill in abstract reasoning, logical deduction and problem solving\u201d. Compa-\nrable arguments have been made at the school level. In a report on post-14\nmathematics in the UK, Smith (2004) argued that \u201cmathematical training\ndisciplines the mind, develops logical and critical reasoning, and develops\nanalytical and problem-solving skills to a high degree\u201d (p.11).\n\u2020 This is a preprint of a paper which appeared in Educational Studies in Mathematics,\n67(3), 187-204. The final version is available at: http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s10649-007-9098-9\nCondInf10b_dist.tex; 9\/02\/2008; 14:48; p.1\n2These widely held views appear to contradict the beliefs of early psy-\nchologists. Thorndike and Woodworth (1901), for example, had found that\n\u201cimprovement in any single mental function rarely brings about equal im-\nprovement in any other function, no matter how similar\u201d (p. 250). Instead they\nsuggested that studying abstract systems such as mathematics or Latin has no\nimpact upon students\u2019 logical reasoning skills (Thorndike, 1924). However, in\na later study of science, humanities and psychology undergraduates, Lehman\nand Nisbett (1990) found a moderate correlation (r = 0.31) between the\nnumber of mathematics courses a student took during their studies and their\nimprovement on a conditional inference test (taken once at the start of their\ndegree course, and once at the end). Conditional inference (drawing conclu-\nsions on the basis of statements of the form \u2018if p then q\u2019 and a premise)\nis clearly fundamental to formal logical reasoning, and Lehman and Nis-\nbett suggested their findings provided some support for the theory of formal\ndiscipline.\nEstablishing the veracity of the formal discipline view is not only of theo-\nretical interest, it has potentially important policy implications. In a survey of\nearly twentieth century US mathematics curricula, Stanic (1986) noted that\nchanges to curricula were substantially related to changing attitudes towards\nthe theory of formal discipline. More recently, Smith (2004) cited the formal\ndiscipline view as evidence for the utility of mathematics in a report to the UK\ngovernment. Amongst other policy recommendations which followed from\nthis conclusion, Smith advocated implementing university tuition fee waivers\nfor mathematics students, and targeted salary increases for school mathemat-\nics teachers. In short, firmly establishing the accuracy (or inaccuracy) of the\nformal discipline theory could have clear educational policy implications and\nit should be regarded as an important goal of mathematics education research.\nSurprisingly, given the importance and long history of these ideas \u2013 which\ndate back at least as far as Plato \u2013 there have apparently been no previous\nstudies which have directly and systematically interrogated the theory of for-\nmal discipline by comparing the conditional inference behaviour of advanced\nmathematics students with those from other disciplines. The primary goal\nof this paper then, is to fill that gap by directly comparing how success-\nful mathematics and arts students draw inferences from abstract conditional\nstatements.\n1. Conditional inference and mathematics.\nGiven a statement \u2018if p then q\u2019 there are four inferences which are com-\nmonly drawn, only two of which are logically valid; the different inferences\nare summarised in Table I. In standard logic, the modus ponens (MP) and\nmodus tollens (MT) inferences are valid, whereas the denial of the antecedent\nCondInf10b_dist.tex; 9\/02\/2008; 14:48; p.2\n3Table I. The four inferences.\nMP DA AC MT\nConditional if p then q if p then q if p then q if p then q\nPremise p not-p q not-q\nConclusion q not-q p not-p\nType affirmative denial affirmative denial\nValidity valid invalid invalid valid\n(DA) and affirmation of the consequent (AC) inferences are invalid.1 Those\ninferences which, from the rule \u2018if p then q\u2019, lead to positive conclusions\n(i.e. conclusions without negated components) are known as \u2018affirmative\u2019\ninferences, whereas those which lead to negative conclusions are referred\nto as \u2018denial\u2019 inferences. Despite their invalidity, DA and AC inferences are\noften made in day-to-day life. For example when a political party announces\nthat \u201cif our opponents win, interest rates will rise\u201d, they are hoping that the\nelectorate will make the DA inference: that voters will infer that if they win,\ninterest rates will not rise.\n1.1. CONDITIONAL INFERENCE IN MATHEMATICS EDUCATION.\nWhile there are other skills involved in logical reasoning performance,\nconditional inference is clearly an important component. Given this, it is\nunsurprising that a number of educational researchers have focussed on\nhow conditionals are dealt with by secondary school students (Hoyles and\nKu\u00a8chemann, 2002; O\u2019Brien et al., 1971; O\u2019Brien, 1972), undergraduates\n(Durand-Guerrier, 2003; O\u2019Brien, 1973; Stylianides et al., 2004), and teach-\ners (Damarin, 1977; Eisenberg and McGinty, 1974). In this section we briefly\nreview the main findings of those studies which have looked at university\nstudents\u2019 conditional inference behaviour.\nO\u2019Brien (1973) studied the conditional inference behaviour of undergrad-\nuates taking an introduction to mathematics course. He gave his participants\na series of conditionals set in different contexts (e.g. \u201cif Sue screams, Jim\nwill jump\u201d) together with a minor premise (\u201cJim did not jump\u201d) and asked\nthem whether inferences could be made (\u201cdid Sue scream?\u201d). O\u2019Brien found\nthat only 3 participants (from a sample of 60) reasoned normatively across\nall the tasks. One particular source of difficulty was the MT inference: across\n1 DA and AC are not the only invalid inferences participants can draw. For example, \u2018if\np then q, p, therefore not-q\u2019 is a further possible invalid inference. No previous study has\nshown evidence that such inferences are widely drawn and we follow the conventions set in\nthe literature by not considering them.\nCondInf10b_dist.tex; 9\/02\/2008; 14:48; p.3\n4the study only 57% of these inferences were endorsed, compared to nearly\n100% for MP. Importantly, O\u2019Brien found that the frequency that the MT\ninference was drawn by depended upon the context in which the rule was\nsituated. Instead of behaving normatively, approximately half of O\u2019Brien\u2019s\n(1973) participants used what he termed \u2018child logic\u2019: they consistently drew\nall the inferences: MP, DA, AC and MT. O\u2019Brien accounted for this by sug-\ngesting that many college students interpret an \u2018if p then q\u2019 conditional as\na \u2018p if and only if q\u2019 biconditional. However Durand-Guerrier (2003), using\nconditionals set in various different mathematical contexts, found that few\nstudents consistently interpreted the conditional in this fashion. Instead, she\nargued that whether this interpretation was made related to the participant\u2019s\nbackground knowledge of the context in which the particular conditional was\nset.\nIn a later study, Stylianides et al. (2004) investigated the differences\nbetween mathematics undergraduates\u2019 and education undergraduates\u2019 be-\nhaviour when drawing DA and MT inferences from contextualised condition-\nals (in what they called a \u2018verbal context\u2019). They also presented participants\nwith a proof validation task to assess MT inferences in a \u2018symbolic context\u2019\n(in our terms, both these versions were contextual, as responses could have\nbeen influenced by prior knowledge). They concluded that, when drawing\nconditional inferences, participants\u2019 mathematical backgrounds interact with\nthe context in which the conditional is set.\nThere are, however, several difficulties with Stylianides et al.\u2019s (2004)\nstudy which render it hard to interpret their results. First, the control group of\neducation students who participated in the study had apparently taken several\ncore proof-based undergraduate mathematics modules which had emphasised\nlogical thinking. Consequently, in the absence of a genuine control group,\nit would be hard to draw conclusions from the study about the relationship\nbetween logical thinking and the study of advanced mathematics. Second,\nthe two contexts used in the study \u2013 verbal and symbolic \u2013 were studied\nusing non-isomorphic tasks: one used a conditional inference task2 and one\nused a proof validation task. It would be hard, therefore, to conclude that\nany between-contexts differences were due to factors related to context rather\nthan to the task structure. Third, the dichotomous data reported in the paper\nappear to have been analysed using parametric statistical methods. Neverthe-\nless, Stylianides et al.\u2019s observation that the context in which a conditional\nstatement is situated affects how participants draw inferences from it is im-\nportant and certainly correct (e.g. Newstead et al., 1997). Given this, it should\n2 To further complicate interpretation, two different rule types were used in the verbal\ncontext task. For the MT inference a rule of the form \u2018if p then q\u2019 was used, whereas the\nDA inference used an \u2018if not-p then q\u2019 rule. As the current study demonstrates, the presence\nor absence of negated components in conditional statements has a large effect upon whether\ninferences are made.\nCondInf10b_dist.tex; 9\/02\/2008; 14:48; p.4\n5be noted that neither O\u2019Brien (1973), Durand-Guerrier (2003) or Stylian-\nides et al. used genuinely abstract materials (in the sense that participants\u2019\nresponses could not have been influenced by their prior knowledge of the\ncontext).\n1.2. CONDITIONAL INFERENCE IN PSYCHOLOGY\nGiven the long history of the formal discipline view, and given the finding that\nthe context in which a task is set interferes with the analysis of participants\u2019\nunderlying logical behaviour, it is perhaps surprising that no previous study\nhas directly compared the conditional inferences that are drawn by advanced\nmathematics students and students of other disciplines, from purely abstract\nmaterials (i.e. with materials far removed from a specific context).\nThere have, however, been numerous psychological studies on conditional\ninference using such materials. These studies have tended to involve social\nscience undergraduates, and much theory has been built up to account for the\ndata resulting from them (e.g. Evans, 2007; Johnson-Laird, 2006; Oaksford\nand Chater, 2007). Given the proliferation of theories in this domain, it is\nimportant to emphasise that our goal in this paper is not to intervene in de-\nbates between the various reasoning theorists, instead we seek to study the\nrelationship between conditional inference behaviour and the advanced study\nof mathematics.\nTypically an abstract conditional inference task in these studies involves a\nseries of imagined letter-number pairs. Participants are given a rule such as\n\u201cif the letter is D then the number is 4\u201d, together with a premise of the form\n\u201cthe number is not 4\u201d, and are asked to decide whether or not a conclusion\n(e.g. \u201cthe letter is not D\u201d) necessarily follows. An example of a trial from\na conditional inference task is shown in Figure 1. In the so-called negations\nparadigm the task is varied by rotating the position of negatives in the rule\ngiving a total of 16 possible inferences. These possibilities are summarised\nin Table II. Two main effects which hinder logical behaviour have been iden-\ntified in existing studies which use this experimental paradigm: the negative\nconclusion effect and the affirmative premise effect.3\nThe negative conclusion effect refers to the finding that participants tend to\ndraw more inferences with negative conclusions than they do inferences with\naffirmative conclusions. That is to say that the inference \u2018if A then 3; not-\n3; therefore not-A\u2019 is made more often than the inference \u2018if not-A then 3;\nnot-3; therefore A\u2019 despite, in this case, both being valid MT inferences. This\n3 Due to differing theoretical interpretations of these effects some researchers have used\ndifferent terminology. The negative conclusion effect is also sometimes referred to as negative\nconclusion bias, or as the double negation effect. Similarly, the affirmative premise effect has\nbeen called affirmative premise bias, or the implicit negation effect (e.g. Evans and Handley,\n1999; Oaksford et al., 2000). We have attempted to adopt theoretically neutral terminology.\nCondInf10b_dist.tex; 9\/02\/2008; 14:48; p.5\n6This problem concerns an imaginary letter-number pair.

One account of this surprising finding maintains that it is caused by the\ndifficulty participants have with the logical equivalence between not-(not-p)\nand p (Evans et al., 1995; Evans and Handley, 1999; Schroyens et al., 2000).\nThis is because on both denial inferences, affirmative conclusions require\nparticipants to take one extra logical step. To clarify, consider making an MT\ninference from the two conditionals above: (i) \u2018if A then 3\u2019 and (ii) \u2018if not-A\nthen 3\u2019. Given the premise not-3, to draw a valid inference with statement\n(i) requires drawing one logical inference (MT). But given the same premise,\nreaching a valid inference with statement (ii) requires an extra step: MT to\ndeduce not-(not-A) and then an application of the equivalence of not-(not-p)\nand p.4\nThe affirmative premise effect refers to the finding that participants tend\nto endorse more inferences from affirmative premises than from negative\npremises. It tends to primarily be observed when those negative premises\nare represented implicitly. That is to say that the inference \u2018if not-A then\n4 An alternative account for the negative conclusion effect states that it is a consequence\nof a preconscious bias in favour of negative conclusions (Pollard and Evans, 1980). Oaksford\net al. (2000) pointed out that, for any p, the probability of not-p tends to be greater than that\nof p. Consequently, they suggested that there could be an inbuilt cognitive reluctance to draw\npositive inferences, as they are more likely to be wrong (although see Schroyens et al., 2000).\nCondInf10b_dist.tex; 9\/02\/2008; 14:48; p.6\n73; A; therefore not-3\u2019 is made more often than the inference \u2018if A then 3; R;\ntherefore not-3\u2019, even though they are both instances of drawing, invalidly, the\nDA inference. Evans and Handley (1999) suggested that this was caused by\nthe difficulty of recognising that the premise was relevant to the conditional\nwhen it is implicitly negated. So the premise \u2018R\u2019 is less obviously \u2018about\u2019 the\nconditional \u2018if A then 3\u2019 than the premise \u2018A\u2019 is \u2018about\u2019 the conditional \u2018if\nnot-A then 3\u2019. This account is discussed in greater depth later in the paper.\nEvans and Handley (1999) brought the negative conclusion and affirma-\ntive premise effects together in what they termed the \u2018two hurdle\u2019 account.\nThey noted that if a conditional inference is to be made two hurdles need to\njumped. Firstly, the reasoner must see that the given premise is relevant to the\nconditional statement. If this hurdle is passed, and the reasoner believes that a\nlegitimate inference can be made, on some occasions there is a further hurdle:\nthe reasoner must be able to convert statements of the form not-(not-p) into\nthe statement p. It is only if both hurdles are successfully traversed that an\ninference can be made.\nIn sum, several mathematics education studies have investigated math-\nematics students\u2019 conditional inferential behaviour on contextual materials,\nand several psychological studies have looked at the conditional inference\nbehaviour of well-educated but non-mathematical participants on abstract\nmaterials. No study, however, has considered the conditional inference be-\nhaviour of mathematics students using abstract materials and, in particular,\nwhether this might differ from non-mathematical participants. This is a curi-\nous omission, for two reasons. First, the studies which have looked at the\ncontextual conditional reasoning of mathematics students have found that\nthe context is a confounding factor; so if one wishes to study the underlying\nlogical behaviour of participants it would be prudent to strip away as many\nextraneous contextual factors as possible. Second, many commentators and\ncurriculum bodies have argued for a version of the formal discipline view, by\nsuggesting that studying mathematics at an advanced level develops students\u2019\nabilities for abstract conditional reasoning. Despite this claim being widely\nmade, there have been few empirical studies which have directly investi-\ngated it, and none have directly compared mathematics and non-mathematics\nstudents\u2019 abstract conditional inference behaviour.\nSpecifically, then, the goal of this study was to examine the formal disci-\npline theory via two main research questions: (i) Do advanced mathematics\nstudents draw more normative inferences from abstract conditional state-\nments than students who have not studied advanced mathematics? (ii) Do\nsuccessful mathematics students exhibit either (a) the negative conclusion\neffect or (b) the affirmative premise effect? If Thorndike and Woodworth\n(1901) and the early psychologists were right, and a training in mathematics\nhas no effect upon abstract logical reasoning skills, one would expect there\nto be few differences between the extent to which mathematics and non-\nCondInf10b_dist.tex; 9\/02\/2008; 14:48; p.7\n8mathematics students are affected by the negative conclusion and affirmative\npremise effects. If, however, the theory of formal discipline (and Lehman\nand Nisbett\u2019s (1990) findings in support of it) is correct, and if studying\nmathematics does develop abstract logical reasoning skills, one might expect\nmathematics students to exhibit reduced negative conclusion and affirmative\npremise effects.\n2. Method.\nWhen designing a study to answer the research questions set out above,\nseveral factors are relevant. Of special concern is that, by most accounts, a\nlarge component of conditional reasoning behaviour is determined by pre-\nconscious cognitive processes (e.g. Evans, 2007). Indeed, by some accounts,\nall reasoning behaviour is determined in this way (e.g. Oaksford and Chater,\n2007). Preconscious cognitive processes are, by definition, unavailable for\nparticipants to report upon concurrently, and so verbal protocol analyses\nmay be at best unhelpful, and at worst misleading (Nisbett and Wilson,\n1977; Wason and Evans, 1975). Further, there is some evidence that asking\nparticipants to \u2018think aloud\u2019 when tackling tasks which have a large non-\nconscious component may detrimentally interfere with their success rates\n(Schooler et al., 1993). Given these factors, we adopted a purely quantitative\ntask-based approach, and adapted the materials and procedure used by Evans\net al. (1995).\nEach participant was presented with 32 reasoning problems of the form\nshown in Figure 1. Half of the questions pertained to the inferences shown in\nTable II, whereas the remaining half were identical in form, except where ex-\nplicitly negated premises had been replaced with implicitly negated premises\n(i.e. premises such as \u2018not-3\u2019 were replaced with, for example, \u20187\u2019). The\nlexical content of the rules were generated randomly, and the order of the\nproblems was randomised for each participant. Participants were tested in\ngroups without time restriction, and were presented with a problem book\nwith six pages of problems, and a page of instructions \u2013 shown in Figure\n2 \u2013 adapted from those used by Evans et al. (1995).\nParticipants were 65 paid volunteers, consisting of 34 arts and social sci-\nence (henceforth arts) undergraduates, and 31 mathematics undergraduates\n(on either single honours programmes, or joint honours programmes which\ncontained a substantial proof-based mathematics component). None of the\narts students were on programmes of study which involved taking proof-\nbased mathematics modules. The mathematics students, in contrast, had all\ntaken a compulsory module on the Foundations of Mathematics (based on\nJohnson, 1998). Along with sections on set theory, functions and cardinality,\nthe course contained several hours of formal teaching about mathematical\nCondInf10b_dist.tex; 9\/02\/2008; 14:48; p.8\n9This experiment is concerned with people\u2019s ability to reason logically with sentences in var-\nious forms. You will be presented with a total of 32 problems on the attached pages. In each\ncase you are given two statements together with a conclusion which may or may not follow\nfrom these statements. Your task in each case is to decide whether or not the conclusion\nnecessarily follows from the statements. A conclusion is necessary if it must be true, given that\nthe statements are true. Each problem concerns an imaginary letter-number pair and contains\nan initial statement or rule which determines which letters may be paired with which numbers.\nAn example of a rule of similar form to those used would be:\nIf the letter is B then the number is not 7.\nIn each case you must assume that the rule holds and then combine it with the information\ngiven in the second statement. This will concern either the letter or the number of an imaginary\npair, for example:\nThe letter is Y.\nThe number is not 4.\nIf the information concerns the letter the conclusion will concern the number and vice-versa.\nA full problem looks something like this:\nIf the letter is X then the number is 1.\nThe letter is X.\nConclusion: The number is 1. \u00a9 YES \u00a9 NO\nIf you think the conclusion necessarily follows please tick the YES box, otherwise tick the\nNO box.

Results.\nWe present the results of this study in three sections. First we discuss the over-\nall inferential behaviour of the participants; second we look at the negative\nconclusion effect; and finally we consider the affirmative premise effect.\n3.1. OVERALL RESPONSES.\nThe number of normatively correct responses was calculated for each par-\nticipant: these ranged from 12 (41%) to 32 (100%). As shown in Table\nIII, the mathematical group had a higher mean number of normative an-\nswers (Mean = 26.6,Std. Dev. = 4.1) than did the arts group (Mean =\nCondInf10b_dist.tex; 9\/02\/2008; 14:48; p.9\n10\nTable III.

Dev. = 4.4), a difference significant at the 0.001 level. Recalling\nthat each type of inference occurred 8 times in the test, considering each type\nseparately indicates where this difference originates. There was no significant\ndifference between the mean number of MP or MT inferences made by each\ngroup: MP inferences were almost always drawn by both groups, whereas\nMT inferences were drawn around two-thirds of the time for each group.\nIn contrast, the mathematics students made significantly fewer invalid (DA\nand AC) inferences than the arts students, both ps < 0.001. In line with\nDurand-Guerrier\u2019s (2003) observation that few students consistently behave\nin accordance with what O\u2019Brien (1973) termed \u2018child logic\u2019, we found that\nonly one participant (an arts student) endorsed every inference.\n3.2. THE NEGATIVE CONCLUSION EFFECT.\nThe number of inferences made by participants with negative and affirmative\nconclusions is shown in Table IV. To conduct the analysis we calculated\na Negative Conclusion Index (NCI), defined by the number of inferences\nendorsed on arguments with negative conclusions minus the number of in-\nferences endorsed on arguments with affirmative conclusions. Thus, since\nthe number of each type of both valid and invalid inferences with negative\nand affirmative conclusions was equal, a participant exhibiting no negative\nconclusion effect would be expected to attain an overall NCI of zero, and a\nparticipant who did exhibit the effect would be expected to have a positive\nNCI. For each group the significance of the negative conclusion effect was\nassessed by comparing the NCIs to zero using a one-sample Wilcoxon signed\nranks test.5 Overall, both groups showed a strong effect (both ps < 0.001).\nA similar analysis was conducted for each type of inference in turn. The\narts group showed a significant effect on the denial MT, p < 0.001, and\nDA, p = 0.004, inferences; but no significant effects on either MP or AC.\n5 In view of the large number of comparisons (ten) being made in this set of Wilcoxon\nsigned-rank analyses, we set a more stringent \u03b1-value of 0.01, rather than the normal 0.05.\nCondInf10b_dist.tex; 9\/02\/2008; 14:48; p.10\n11\nTable IV. The percentage of inferences with negative and affirmative conclusions\nmade by each group (Art \u2013 arts, Mat \u2013 mathematics), collapsed across premise-type\n(explicit\/implicit negatives).\nMP DA AC MT Overall\nArt Mat Art Mat Art Mat Art Mat Art Mat\nNeg Concl 94 97 63 37 76 25 76 85 77 61\nAff Concl 93 97 40 10 65 19 46 52 61 45\nThe mathematics group showed a significant effect on the MT inference,\np < 0.001, but none on either MP, DA or AC.\nTo further explore these data, we adopted a similar procedure to that fol-\nlowed by Evans and Handley (1999). Participants\u2019 NCIs were subjected to an\nanalysis of variance (ANOVA) with two within-participant factors (inference-\ntype and negation-type), and one between-participants factor (group). The\nnegation-type factor referred to whether the inference involved explicitly\nnegated premises or implicitly negated premises. Given the finding that the\nnegative conclusion effect was only significant on denial inferences, the\ninference-type factor was obtained by collapsing the four inferences into two\ncategories: affirmative (MP and AC) and denial (DA and MT). Consequently\nthe indices ranged from \u22124 to 4, giving a reasonable approximation to the\ncontinuous distribution assumption of ANOVA. As predicted by the literature,\nthere was a significant effect for inference-type, F(1, 63) = 33.9, p < 0.001,\nwith a mean NCI for denial inferences of 1.75 compared to 0.28 for affir-\nmative inferences. The mean NCIs for each group, for each inference-type\nare shown in Figure 3. There was no significant effect for negation-type,\nnor were there significant inference-type\u00d7group, negation-type\u00d7group or\ninference-type\u00d7negation-type\u00d7group interaction effects, all Fs < 1.\nIn sum, both the mathematics students and the arts students exhibited the\nnegative conclusion effect: they were more likely to endorse denial inferences\nwith negative conclusions than they were with affirmative conclusions. Fur-\nthermore, there were no significant differences between the degrees by which\neach group was affected.\n3.3. THE AFFIRMATIVE PREMISE EFFECT.\nTo test for the affirmative premise effect we again followed the procedure\nused by Evans and Handley (1999), by calculating an Affirmative Premise\nIndex (API). This was given by the number of inferences endorsed on argu-\nments with affirmative premises minus the number of inferences endorsed\non arguments with negative premises. Thus a participant who showed no\naffirmative premise effect would be expected to have an API of zero, and a\nCondInf10b_dist.tex; 9\/02\/2008; 14:48; p.11\n12\nFigure 3. The mean NCIs for each group, for each inference-type. Error bars represent\u00b11 SE\nof the mean.\nparticipant who did show such an effect would be expected to have a positive\nAPI. A participant who exhibited the standard effect from the literature (of\nexhibiting a larger affirmative premise effect on inferences with implicitly\nnegated premises) would be expected to have a higher API on inferences\nwith implicitly negated premises than on inferences with explicitly negated\npremises. Equally, a participant who exhibited no such difference would be\nexpected to have equal APIs for the two negation-types.\nTable V shows the percentage of inferences made from affirmative\npremises and negative premises, for each of the two negation-types. For\neach group the significance of the affirmative premise effect was assessed by\ncomparing the APIs to zero using a one-sample Wilcoxon signed ranks test.6\nOverall, the arts group followed the pattern predicted by the literature and\nshowed a large significant affirmative premise effect on implicitly negated\npremises, p < 0.001, and a significant, but smaller, effect on explicitly\nnegated premises, p = 0.002. However, no significant effects were found for\nthe mathematics group on either negation-type. Considering each inference\nseparately showed significant effects for the arts group on MP (implicit),\np = 0.002, AC (implicit), p < 0.001, DA (implicit), p = 0.008, and DA\n(explicit), p = 0.002. The mathematics group showed no significant effects\non any inference.\nThe main analysis followed a slightly different route to that used for\nthe NCIs. Due to Schroyens et al.\u2019s (2001) observation that the affirmative\n6 As with the NCI analysis, we set a more stringent \u03b1-value of 0.01 for this set of Wilcoxon\nsigned-rank comparisons.\nCondInf10b_dist.tex; 9\/02\/2008; 14:48; p.12\n13\nTable V.

Consequently the APIs\nwere subjected to an ANOVA with two within-participant factors (validity\nand negation-type), and one between-participants factor (group). As before,\nthe negation-type factor referred to whether the inference involved premises\nwhich were explicitly or implicitly negated, whereas the new validity factor\ncame from collapsing inferences into those which are valid (MP and MT)\nand those which are invalid (DA and AC). As with the NCI analysis, then, the\nindices ranged from \u22124 to 4.\nAs predicted by the literature there was a significant effect for validity,\nF(1, 63) = 22.5, p < 0.001, with a mean API of 0.36 for valid inferences\ncompared to 1.54 for invalid inferences. There was, however, no validity\u00d7\ngroup interaction, F < 1. Importantly, there was a significant negation-\ntype\u00d7group interaction, F(1, 63) = 4.04, p = 0.049. This interaction is\nshown visually in Figure 4. The arts group showed a large difference in affir-\nmative premise effects between the two negation-types, with a difference be-\ntween the mean APIs of implicitly and explicitly negated premises of +0.91,\nt (33) = 2.67, p = 0.012. In contrast the difference for the mathematics\ngroup was only +0.04, t (30) = 0.12,NS. No significant validity\u00d7negation-\ntype, F(1, 63) = 3.18,NS, or validity\u00d7negation-type\u00d7group, F < 1,\ninteraction effects were found.\nIn sum, the arts students in the sample exhibited the standard affirmative\npremise effect. They endorsed more inferences with affirmative premises than\nthey did inferences with negated premises, with a larger effect when these\nnegated premises were expressed implicitly compared to when they were\nexpressed explicitly. In contrast, however, the mathematics group exhibited\nno effect on either the implicit or explicit negation-types.\nCondInf10b_dist.tex; 9\/02\/2008; 14:48; p.13\n14\nFigure 4. The mean APIs for each group, for each negation-type. Error bars represent \u00b11 SE\nof the mean.\n4. Discussion.\n4.1. SUMMARY OF MAIN FINDINGS.\nThe main goals of this study were to (i) determine whether advanced math-\nematics students draw more normative inferences from abstract conditional\nstatements than students who have not studied advanced mathematics; and,\n(ii) to investigate whether successful mathematics students exhibit the two\nmain effects which have been found to interfere with normative logical\nbehaviour when drawing conditional inferences; namely (a) the negative\nconclusion effect, and (b) the affirmative premise effect.\nThe picture which emerged was unexpectedly mixed. Our data showed\nthat those students with experience of advanced mathematics did indeed make\nmore normatively correct choices on an abstract conditional inference task\nthan those without such experience. Interestingly, however, the only signif-\nicant difference between the two groups came on the invalid AC and DA\ninferences. In short, the mathematics students were better than the arts stu-\ndents at rejecting invalid inferences, but not significantly better at endorsing\nvalid inferences. In particular, this finding replicates and extends O\u2019Brien\u2019s\n(1973) finding that many mathematics students have difficulty with MT in-\nferences (in our study 69% and 61% of MT inferences were endorsed by\nthe mathematics and arts groups respectively; in O\u2019Brien\u2019s study, albeit with\ncontextualised materials, the equivalent figure was 57%). We also replicated\nDurand-Guerrier\u2019s (2003) finding that O\u2019Brien\u2019s \u2018child logic\u2019 is consistently\nused by very few students.\nCondInf10b_dist.tex; 9\/02\/2008; 14:48; p.14\n15\nWith respect to the negative conclusion effect, our data showed that both\nthe groups tended to endorse more denial inferences with negative conclu-\nsions than they did denial inferences with positive conclusions. The difference\nbetween mean NCIs for denial and affirmative inferences was approximately\nequal for the two groups, suggesting that both were affected by the negative\nconclusion effect by similar degrees.\nIn contrast, there was a between-groups difference with regards to the\naffirmative premise effect. The arts group showed the standard effect: they\nendorsed more inferences with affirmative premises than they did inferences\nwith negated premises, and the effect was larger when those negations were\nrepresented implicitly. The mathematics group, in contrast, showed no effect.\nCrucially, there was a significant negation-type\u00d7group interaction for APIs,\nsuggested that the affirmative premise effect did manifest itself differently for\nthe two groups.7 In the remaining two sections of this discussion we consider\nissues surrounding the negative conclusion and affirmative premise effects,\nand suggest links between our results and recent theories on mathematical\nrepresentations.\n4.2. THE NEGATIVE CONCLUSION EFFECT.\nThe negative conclusion effect refers to the tendency of participants to en-\ndorse more inferences which lead to negative conclusions than those which\nlead to affirmative conclusions. As predicted by the literature, the arts group\nin our study exhibited this effect on denial inferences. But, despite making\nmore normatively correct responses overall, the mathematics group also ex-\nhibited the effect on denial inferences, by a similar degree of magnitude to\nthe arts students.\nAs discussed, one mechanism which has been proposed to account for the\nnegative conclusion effect is related to the difficulty of making the deduc-\ntive step from not-(not-p) to p. Consider, for example, the two inferences\nin Figure 5. The mental logic account of reasoning proposes that MT is an\napplication of MP with a contradiction argument (Braine and O\u2019Brien, 1998).\nFigure 5, supposing this process, shows the inferential steps required for each\ninference.8 The righthand inference (with a positive conclusion) requires the\nextra step of double negation compared to the lefthand inference (with a neg-\native conclusion), perhaps making the inference harder to complete. It is of\ncourse well known that students have difficulty negating complex quantified\n7 Note that this interaction cannot be accounted for by the mathematics group\u2019s tendency\nto endorse fewer invalid inferences than the arts group. If this were the primary reason for the\nnegation-type\u00d7group interaction, one would also expect a significant inference-type\u00d7group\ninteraction effect, whereas actually this effect did not approach significance, F < 1.\n8 An essentially identical analysis (in the sense that it invokes a double negation process\nto account for the negative conclusion effect) can be made using the mental models theory of\nreasoning (Johnson-Laird, 2006).\nCondInf10b_dist.tex; 9\/02\/2008; 14:48; p.15\n16\nRule: If the letter is T then the number is 6.

THE AFFIRMATIVE PREMISE EFFECT.\nThe affirmative premise effect refers to the phenomenon of participants en-\ndorsing more inferences with affirmative premises than negative premises.\nThe effect tends to be stronger when negative premises are represented im-\nplicitly (i.e. as \u20188\u2019 rather than \u2018not-1\u2019). In this paper we have reported evidence\nthat arts students exhibited, as predicted by the literature, an increased ef-\nfect for inferences with implicitly negated premises over explicitly negated\npremises; but, in contrast, we found that participants with a background in\nproof-based mathematics exhibited no effect at all. In this section we consider\none account for this effect, and on its relation with advanced mathematical\nstudy.9\nEvans and Handley (1999) suggested that the reason why the affirmative\npremise effect is substantially larger on inferences with implicitly negated\npremises is that participants see fewer implicitly negated premises as rele-\nvant to the conditional than they do explicitly negated premises, and so they\n9 It should be reemphasised that there is considerable debate about the mechanism behind\nthe affirmative premise effect, and our goal here is not to intervene in disputes between reason-\ning theorists (interested readers can consult the discussions between Evans, 2002; Oaksford,\n2002; and Yama, 2001).\nCondInf10b_dist.tex; 9\/02\/2008; 14:48; p.16\n17\nRule: If the letter is H then the number is 1.

Two MT inference tasks, one with an explicitly negated premise (left) and one with\nan implicitly negated premise (right).\nmake fewer inferences. In short, participants fall at the first hurdle of the\n\u2018two hurdles\u2019 account. The crucial factor here appears to be the way premises\nin conditional inference tasks are represented. The nature of mathematical\nrepresentations, and their influence on the learning of mathematics has re-\nceived considerable attention in recent years, and in the discussion below we\ndraw parallels between our work and contemporary studies on mathematical\nrepresentations.\nLesh et al. (1987) introduced the notion of transparent and opaque\nrepresentations of mathematical concepts. In their terms, an opaque repre-\nsentation emphasises some aspects of the concept, whilst de-emphasising\nothers; whereas, in contrast, a transparent representation neither adds nor\ntakes away meaning from the underlying concept. Zazkis and Gadowsky\n(2001) argued that a single representation may be transparent with respect to\ncertain properties, but opaque with respect to others. For example, one way\nof representing the number 1007 is 1000+7, another way is 53\u00d719. The first\nrepresentation emphasises that 1007 is larger than 1000, but de-emphasises\nthat it is divisible by 53 (it is transparent with respect to magnitude, but\nopaque with respect to divisibility). The second representation has the reverse\nproperty (it is transparent with respect to divisibility, but opaque with respect\nto magnitude). Zazkis and Liljedahl (2004) argued that the reason students\nhave considerable difficulties with understanding prime numbers and prime\nfactorisation is because of the lack of a transparent representation system for\nprimes, and similar observations can be made of higher level mathematics.\nIn the domain of knot theory, for example, the Tait Conjectures remained\nunproved for much of the twentieth century, but upon the discovery of new\nand more transparent ways of representing knots \u2013 the Jones and HOMFLY\npolynomials \u2013 the conjectures were quickly solved.\nKirshner and Awtry (2004) noted that representation systems for some\nmathematical concepts may be opaque in a slightly different way: rather\nthan de-emphasising certain valid properties, they may emphasise other in-\nvalid properties. Kirshner and Awtry suggested that many of the widely\ndocumented \u2018mal-rules\u2019 applied by students when making algebraic manip-\nulations are a consequence of such effects. For example, both the mal-rule\nam+n = am +an , and the actual rule a(m+n) = am+an are salient: the left\nand right sides of the equations appear naturally similar. Kirshner and Awtry\nCondInf10b_dist.tex; 9\/02\/2008; 14:48; p.17\n18\nfound that students were more likely to accurately complete transformations\nif they had this saliency property. No such difference, however, was found\nfor students who has been taught algebra with a representation system which\neliminated these saliency features. Complementary results were published by\nLandy and Goldstone (2007), who found that the internal spacing of algebraic\nexpressions can affect their opaqueness\/transparency.\nThe affirmative premise effect could, then, be reconceptualised using the\nterminology adopted by Lesh et al. (1987). In the example given in Figure\n6, the notation \u20188\u2019 is an opaque representation for the concept not-q; in con-\ntrast, the notation \u2018not 1\u2019 is a transparent representation, as it shares salient\nfeatures with the conditional \u2018if p then q\u2019: the presence of 1. In short, Evans\nand Handley\u2019s (1999) account of the affirmative premise effect suggests that\nparticipants struggle to see through the opaqueness of the notation used in\nthe implicitly negated component of the task, in exactly the same way as the\nstudents studied by Kirshner and Awtry (2004), Lesh et al., and Zazkis and\nLiljedahl (2004) struggled to see through the opaqueness of the notations used\nin their tasks. However, the crucial difference between our study, and those of\nother researchers who have looked at opaque and transparent representations,\nis that unlike the arts students, the mathematics students in our sample (all\nundergraduates who had been highly successful at school level mathemat-\nics) were apparently not affected by the opaqueness of the representation of\nimplicitly negated premises: they exhibited no affirmative negation effect on\neither negation-type.\nAll these disparate studies point in the same direction: towards the specu-\nlative hypothesis that one characteristic of successful mathematical thinking\nis an ability to override the attentional biases that are generated by opaque\nrepresentations. This study suggests that mathematics students are not af-\nfected by the opaqueness of implicit negations on an abstract conditional\ninference task. Similarly Kirshner and Awtry (2004), Lesh et al. (1987) and\nZazkis and Liljedahl (2004) have shown that one of the primary difficulties\nweak students have with mathematics is related to exactly these types of\nopaque representations. It seems reasonable, therefore, to speculate that the\nability to \u2018see through\u2019 opaque representations is a characteristic of mathe-\nmatically successful students. Expert\/novice differences in the deployment\nof attention whilst engaged in mathematical activities would appear to be a\nfruitful area for future research.\n5. Conclusion.\nMany curriculum bodies and commentators have supported a form of the\ntheory of formal discipline by expressing the view that studying mathemat-\nics facilitates abstract logical reasoning. Despite the sceptical views of early\nCondInf10b_dist.tex; 9\/02\/2008; 14:48; p.18\n19\npsychologists towards this position (e.g. Thorndike and Woodworth, 1901),\nLehman and Nisbett (1990) found a slight correlation between the number of\nmathematics courses taken by science and humanities students during their\ndegree and their improvement on a test of conditional reasoning. To inves-\ntigate this view, we directly compared the inferences drawn by mathematics\nand arts undergraduates from abstract conditional statements. The overall pic-\nture we found was mixed. Successful mathematics students endorsed fewer\ninvalid inferences than a control group of arts students, but they did not en-\ndorse more valid inferences. We paid particular attention to two effects which\nhave been found to interfere with normative logical behaviour: the negative\nconclusion effect and the affirmative premise effect. It was found that both\nthe arts and mathematics students in our sample endorsed significantly more\ninferences which led to negative conclusions than they did inferences which\nled to affirmative conclusions. In contrast, only the arts group exhibited the\naffirmative premise effect: they endorsed more inferences with affirmative\npremises than they did inferences with negative premises. This was not the\ncase with the mathematics group.\nOne unresolved question is related to the cause of these between-groups\ndifferences. Whilst we have found a correlation between the study of ad-\nvanced mathematics and a different pattern of responses to an abstract\nconditional inference task, we have not established the causal relationship\nposited by the formal discipline view. There are two reasonable hypotheses.\nPerhaps, as suggested by those who support a form of the theory of formal\ndiscipline (Oakley, 1946; Smith, 2004), exposure to the study of higher level\nmathematics brings about the development of certain logical skills: in par-\nticular the ability to recognise invalid inferences, and to see through opaque\nrepresentations. An alternative hypothesis, however, is that there is a sub-\nset of the population who are naturally skilled in these areas, and that it is\nthis subset who are disproportionately filtered into studying mathematics at\nadvanced levels. Although our cross-sectional data do not allow us to dis-\ntinguish between these hypotheses, in view of Lehman and Nisbett\u2019s (1990)\nfindings we feel there is more support for the formal discipline view, albeit\nwith important caveats. In particular it is clear that there is no simplistic rela-\ntionship between advanced mathematical study and abstract logical reasoning\nskills: the idea that mathematicians are simply \u2018better\u2019 at abstract logic is too\nsimplistic (indeed, there are some areas where they are not, apparently, any\nbetter). But, equally, we have also demonstrated that theories which posit no\nrelationship are also too simplistic. We found that in some crucial aspects of\nconditional inferential reasoning mathematics undergraduates behave more\nnormatively than arts undergraduates, whereas in some other aspects they do\nnot. Determining whether these differences are developed, and, if they are,\nat which curriculum stage they develop, would be a valuable goal for future\nresearch.\nCondInf10b_dist.tex; 9\/02\/2008; 14:48; p.19\n20\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Gary Davis, Paola Iannone and Keith Weber for their\nhelpful comments on earlier drafts of this work.\nReferences\nBarnard, A.
