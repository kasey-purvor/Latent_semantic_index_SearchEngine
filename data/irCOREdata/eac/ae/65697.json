In other \nwords, what we are looking for is a relational network approach that neither \nunder-socialises nor over-socialises current developments in the global \neconomy (Hess and Yeung, 2006). This, we feel, moves us towards a \u201ecultural \npolitical economy\u201f of GPNs, that is capable of integrating both the system-\nworld and life-world aspects of global networks and their related \ndevelopmental outcomes while at the same time being aware of the pitfalls of \nconceptual \u201eimperialism\u201f, \u201emethodological nationalism (Pries, 2005) and \nproblematic binaries like global-local and culture-economy (Gregson et al, \n2001)\u201d. \n \nIn this paper, I want to take up this challenge and explore some of the \nimplications of pursuing a cultural political economy\u201f (CPE) approach to the \nanalysis of GPNs, understanding production to encompass the whole gamut \nof activities comprising the circuit of production \u2013 that is, the production, \nexchange and consumption in various ways of what is produced, intentionally \nand unintentionally. GPNs can be seen as constituted via a variety of flows (of \ncapital in various forms such as commodities and money, knowledge and \npeople) between a variety of nodes, sites and spaces (of production, \nexchange and consumption), with varying governance arrangements, both \nmulti-scalar (supra-national, national, regional and urban) and non-scalar \nnetworked forms of governance.  As these are Global Production Networks \nthese nodes and the flows linking them are, by definition, distributed around \nthe globe, albeit unevenly. In pursuing the implications of exploring GPNs \nthrough the lens of CPE or, more ambitiously, conjoining GPNs with CPE, I \nwish to both acknowledge the innovative work of Jessop and Sum (2006) and \nSum and Jessop (2008) but also to begin to go beyond this and take up the \nchallenge posed by Coe and Hess to integrate serious consideration of the \nCultural Political Economy Meets Global Production Networks: A Productive Meeting? \n \n 2 \nmaterial into CPE. In their approach to CPE Jessop and Sum consider \npolitical-economic and semiotic dimensions to great effect in a novel and \nsophisticated way (Hudson, 2007a). Furthermore, they integrate the treatment \nof time and space into their analysis, recognising the emergent properties of \nthe complex economy, its development on an open-ended though still path \ndependent trajectory, and the spatiality of the economy in terms of its different \nsites and spaces and the connections between them. However, critically, they \nfail to engage seriously enough with the materiality of the economy (beyond \nthe recognition that the production of use values necessarily involves people \nworking on and with elements of the natural world and matter of various sorts \nand transforming them to create value) and so with the relations between the \nmaterial, semiotic and political-economic. These links need to be \nsystematically integrated into a more rounded CPE. \n \nI have argued elsewhere that a CPE perspective must involve understanding \n\u201ethe economy\u201f in terms of three registers, each constituted through a variety of \ncircuits and (non-linear) flows linking a variety of sites and spaces (see \nHudson 2001 and 2005 for some preliminary consideration of these issues). \nThe first of these is political-economic, encompassing labour processes as \nwell as processes of value creation, exchange and realisation, in addition to \nthe consumption of commodities. The second is semiotic, relating to flows of \nknowledge and information and to the culturally-endowed meanings that \nthings come to acquire. The third is material, conceptualising the economy in \nterms of materials transformations - biological, chemical and physical - as well \nas flows of energy, matter and materials, drawing here on literatures in \nmaterials and natural sciences and reading these through the perspectives of \npolitical-economy and semiotics drawn from the social sciences. Finally, it is \nimportant to emphasise the relations between these three registers and the \nflows and spaces through which they are co-constituted and the inter-\nrelationships among them (see Hudson, 2004). For example, the issue of \nwhether commodities cease to have use values and become \u201ewastes\u201f or are \nre-valorised and take on new use values depends inter alia, on issues of \nmeaning and processes of re-valuation. The identification of the three \nregisters of a CPE approach implies the need to think of three sorts of circuits \nand the spaces and sites through which they flow and which they help \nconstitute, as well as the relationships among and co-constitution of these \nflows in terms of the (re)production of GPNs. In addition, as well as the \ndangers identified by Coe and Hess, it is vital to avoid linear conceptions of \nflows and to acknowledge the complexity of the economy and of GPNs, the \ncircuits and feedbacks loops that give rise to emergent properties1.   \n                                                 \n1\n It became clear in discussions with Nicky Gregson in the context of a major ESRC-funded \nproject \u201cThe Waste of the World\u201d (http:\/\/www.thewasteoftheworld.org\/)  in which we are both \ninvolved that the metaphor of the circuit requires some further unpacking and elaboration, \nespecially in the context of conceptualising the economy as a process with emergent \nproperties. As a metaphor, \u201ecircuit\u201f speaks to two rather different aspects of connectivity and \nflow. First, it draws upon the notion of electrical circuits, with flows channelled between nodes \nvia switching points, with the end point different to the origin, indicative of the complexity of \nthe economy and its capacity to produce emergent effects \u2013 with such moments of \nemergence marked, perhaps, by the circuit blowing a fuse and subsequently being re-\nconfigured in a new way. Circuits and feedbacks loops may, then, under certain \ncircumstances, give rise to emergent properties rather than simply reproducing existing \nCultural Political Economy Meets Global Production Networks: A Productive Meeting? \n \n 3 \n \nIn the remainder of this paper I will focus upon some aspects of the political-\neconomic, semiotic and material registers of CPE with the intention of \ndeepening understanding of GPNs. The identification of these three registers \nimplies the need to think through the relationships among and co-constitution \nof the various sorts of circuits, flows and transformations encompassed by \nthem, as well as giving consideration to the spaces and sites through which \nthey pass and which they help constitute. Of necessity this will be a partial \nand selective coverage but one that will, I hope, nonetheless, realise its \nintended effects and help deepen understanding of the concept of GPNs. \n \nPolitical-economy and circuits of value \n \nIn the course of single day, we \u2013 that is, those of us in the more developed \nparts of the global political-economy \u2013 typically come into contact with a more \nor less sophisticated range of artefacts and material goods and objects that \nunderpin our daily lives and, indeed, make them possible. Automobiles, frozen \nfoodstuffs, mobile \u201ephones, shirts and shoes, the PC on which I\u201fm writing this - \nthe list is long, if not quite endless. Often, much of the time, we take their \navailability and presence for granted, even when we occasionally recall that \nmany of them were produced on the other side of the world in China or parts \nof south east Asia. How do they come to be produced, acquire value and find \ntheir way to us? How can we begin to understand these processes of \nproduction, value creation and valuation?  \n \nAs a starting point in seeking answers to these questions, it is critical to \nrecognise the existence of different concepts of value and processes of \nvaluation and the articulation and relations between different socio-economic \nsystems (or social formations) grounded in different concepts of value \n(Hudson and Lee, forthcoming). At a rather high level of abstraction and \ngeneralisation, all forms of economy and society may conceptualised as \nreproduced via continuous flows of value as products circulate between \npeople, times and places. These flows of value, moving through the sequence \nof production, exchange and consumption, are both constituted in and help \nconstitute circuits of social reproduction. Value can be thought of as \ngenerated through relations and things which, via the material and social \n                                                                                                                                            \nproperties and relations.  In short, feedback does not necessarily imply a return to the same \nstarting point or state; it may do, but it need not do even if this was the intention of those \nmanaging the process precisely because of the endless capacity of material to exceed or \nescape the frame established by the process of transformation itself. Secondly, it invokes the \nidea of circuits as recursive flows, with material of various sorts flowing though a variety of \nqualitative transformations and returning to its original qualitative starting form, as in the \ncircuits of capital. However, this does not necessarily mean a return to the same starting point \nas these are flows in real time and may well involve a quantitative augmentation of value as \nwell as physical transformation of material. It is important to note that some material \ntransformations produce irreversible transformative effects so that return to the original \nqualitative state of matter is impossible. As this last point suggests the process of value \ncreation and the creation of exchange and use values may well be decisively shaped by the \npossibilities \u2013 and limitations - of material transformation.  \n \n \nCultural Political Economy Meets Global Production Networks: A Productive Meeting? \n \n 4 \npractices of the economy (production, exchange and consumption), come to \nbe regarded as socially useful, helpful, uplifting or, more narrowly but \ngenerally, as fundamental to everyday life going on \u201cas normal\u201d. These flows \nencompass the exchange of value embodied in products and may involve the \nexchange of money for work or the capacity to work, which could lead to an \naugmentation of future production and\/or consumption. Social and material \nsurvival requires that circuits of social reproduction deliver such flows of \nvalue, in appropriate quantities, distributions, and time\/spaces.  In turn, \nsuccessfully maintaining such circuits necessarily involves often-subtle \nprocesses of regulation and complex intersections of material and social \nrelationships and practices in the formation and definition of value. The \nmaterial and the social are intimately related via circuits of co-evolution and \nco-determination: \u201cthe significance of any single moment of economic activity \nbegins to make sense in material terms only in the context of circuits of \nmaterial reproduction\u201d (Lee, 2002, 336). Material relations, imbued with social \nmeaning, involve the practice and co-ordination of circuits of production, \nexchange and consumption (and in a later section of the paper I return to \nissues of materiality from a rather different perspective). Thus social relations, \nvariable over time\/space, define the meanings of material practices. These \nrelationships and meanings may become hegemonic, voluntarily, often \nunquestioningly, accepted and confer a sense of social order via the recurrent \npractices of the economy. In other circumstances, maintaining social \nreproduction requires deployment of power within circuits of authority, control \nand direction to shape economic processes and circuits of material practices \n(and, viewed historically, hegemony has often been preceded by domination). \nThe substantive content and meaning of conceptions of value are therefore \nspatio-temporally specific. What is seen as valuable in one socio-spatial \ncontext may not be so in another. The origins of these differences lie different \nmodes of socio-economic organisation and are expressed in different ways of \nconceptualising and theorising \u201cthe economy\u201d.  \n \nWhile recognising that contemporary capitalist economies are constituted via \na variety of social relations and their associated concepts of value, however, it \nis equally important to acknowledge the dominance of capitalist concepts of \nvalue in the contemporary world, as this is what defines these economies as \ncapitalist. Recognising that there are multiple circuits of capital (for example, a \nprimary circuit constituted via co-existing circuits of commodity, money and \nindustrial capital, as well as secondary and tertiary circuits: Harvey, 1982; \nHudson, 2005, Chapter 2), I will take the (admittedly over-simplified) case of \nthe circuit of industrial capital and the processes and regulatory mechanisms \nby which this improbable process of the circulation of capital is routinely \nreproduced to develop this point. Mainstream capitalist production is centred \nupon commodity production, the production of things with the intention of sale \nin markets, and value expansion via the production and realisation of surplus-\nvalue. Consider the production of that iconic commodity of mass produced  \nmodernity, the automobile \u2013 a result of workers assembling a huge variety of \nmaterials and components embodying a vast range of materials (various \nmetals, glass, plastics, hydrocarbons, rubber, wood and so on), fixed in a \nparticular order to create the finished product. More generally, and abstractly, \ncapital brings together constant and variable capital - the necessary \nCultural Political Economy Meets Global Production Networks: A Productive Meeting? \n \n 5 \nequipment, components and materials and labour - so that in the moment of \nproduction commodities are created that embody greater value than the value \nlaid out to purchase the inputs to the production process. This is a \nconsequence of the unique attributes of labour-power as a fictitious \ncommodity, since people create surplus-value in excess of the value \nequivalent of the wages that they are paid for going to work (see Hudson, \n2001). Consequently, capitalist production is simultaneously a labour process \nbased upon the exploitation of labour (and so one that encompasses the life-\nworld at work of those engaged in production and waged work more \ngenerally), a process of valorisation and value expansion and a process of \nmaterial transformation2, as a result of which commodities simultaneously \npossess the properties of use values and exchange values. This form of \norganising production is based on the class structural separation of, and \ndialectical relation between, capital and labour within the abstract conceptual \nspace defined by the capitalist mode of production.  \n \nIn actually existing capitalisms, or capitalist social formations, these social \nrelations are extended and stretched over space and imposed upon people to \ndefine the character of social reproduction \u2013 although not without contestation \nand resistance \u2013 by commercial, industrial and financial institutions operating \nover multiple and mutually constitutive spatial scales from the very local to the \nglobal. Space in general and particular spaces are thus integral to the \nbiography of commodities, which move between various sites of production, \nexchange and consumption as they flow around and beyond the circuits of \ncapital, an insight that has been powerfully developed by the perspectives of \nglobal commodity chains, global value chains and most recently, GPNs. In \nthis sense, to conceptualise production in terms of GPNs is to do no more \u2013 \nand no less - than to recognise the practical realities of capitalist economies. \n \nCommercial, industrial and financial institutions define highly focused and \nspecific notions of value directed at profitability and accumulation and use \nthem to constrain and direct capitalist circuits of social reproduction \u2013 that is, \nthe expansion of capital and the socio-spatial extension (for example, in the \ncontemporary period, to China and other emerging economies) and \ndeepening (in existing centres of capitalism) of capitalist social relationships \nas these penetrate realms from which they were previously excluded such as \nthe body, the family and the home (for example, see Baumann, 2005, 81-\n115). In this way, the social and material dimensions of social reproduction \nare mutually formative and inseparable and take a specific form within the \nparameters of capitalist social relationships. For example, in the formal \ncapitalist economy value can be defined as market price (as in neo-classical \nand mainstream orthodox theories), or as socially necessary labour time (as \nin the orthodox Marxian labour theory of value or as in the value theory of \nlabour: Elson, 1978)3. Thus, in marked contrast to mainstream and neo-\nclassical conceptions, Marxian analyses recognise in their conceptualisation \nof flows of value and circuits of capital in the specific context of the formal \n                                                 \n2 Although as I shall argue this aspect of materials transformation has been neglected in \nmuch of political-economy and this is a neglect that requires rectification. \n3 Note that the socially-necessary is context dependent and specific and as such variable \nover time\/space rather than this being an essentialised and invariant quantity.  \nCultural Political Economy Meets Global Production Networks: A Productive Meeting? \n \n 6 \ncapitalist economy, that values and prices are not synonymous and that the \nrelationships between them need to be considered. Not least this is because \nof the characteristics of money and monetary systems and the disciplining \npower of money on the practices and developmental trajectories of \neconomies.  \n \nThe routine performance of the social relationships of production, exchange and \nconsumption and the day-to-day conduct and market transactions of a capitalist \neconomy (such as declaring profits, paying wages or buying food and clothing) \nare conducted in terms of prices, not values. Economic agents freely enter into \nmarket relations mediated by monetary prices. Money thus serves as both a \nmedium of exchange and a measure of value, though not one that equates to \nvalues defined in terms of socially necessary labour time (and the issue of how \nbest to conceptualise relations between values and prices has become a matter \nof some, as yet unresolved and probably irresolvable, debate). What is clear is \nthat monetary price is always a slippery, imperfect and unreliable re presentation \nof value. Discrepancies between supply and demand in markets result in \ncommodities being exchanged at prices that diverge from their values. As \nproduction conditions diverge from social and technical averages, the amounts \nof labour time embodied in commodities deviate from the socially necessary \namount that defines the value of a commodity. Commodities thus contain \nvarying amounts of labour time but are sold at the same market price while \nmoney prices typically diverge from exchange values. As a result, there is a \nredistributive flow of value between spaces, sectors and companies via the \nprocesses of competition. This redistribution is critically important in relation to \nthe systemic dynamism of capitalist economies, to processes of \u201ccreative \ndestruction\u201d as firms seek competitive advantage via innovation and \nrevolutionising the what, how and where of production, and so to their historical \ngeographies of production and uneven development and the current \nconfiguration of GPNs. \n \nBeyond the confines of the formal capitalist economy and theorisations of it \nbut within the broader confines of capitalism and their theorisation, there are \nalternative conceptions of value in terms of labour time (as in Local Exchange \nTrading Systems, or LETS), or in terms of the intrinsic worth of things or \naffective dimensions such as friendship, love and respect \u2013 not all of which \ncan be represented in terms of price. Indeed, there are things that people \nvalue that are, quite literally, priceless. It is impossible to put a price upon \nthem because their value cannot be translated into a quantitative monetary \nmetric. Such alternative conceptions of value influence economic practices \nwithin the spaces of mainstream economies of capitalism, while they also \npermeate the interstices that capital has abandoned or never found \nsufficiently attractive, or those areas from which, in a given time\/space, it is \nprohibited by regulation or morality, custom and the force of tradition. It is also \nimportant to emphasise that these alternative conceptions of value often \nunderpin the reproduction of the circuits of capital that constitute the formal \neconomy (for example, through the reproduction of labour-power via domestic \nlabour and the life-world of the home as class and non-class relations become \nentwined in particular ways) while in turn for many people the successful \nreproduction of their daily lives depends upon their capacity to purchase and \nCultural Political Economy Meets Global Production Networks: A Productive Meeting? \n \n 7 \nconsume commodities (and so the entanglement of their life-world in spaces \nof exchange and consumption). Similarly, circuits of capital are often \naugmented by processes of accumulation via dispossession (seeing this as \nan enduring feature of the process of accumulation rather than a transitory \nphase in the early history of capitalism: for example, see Wood, 2002), the \nappropriation of value from spaces of non-capitalist economic practices and \nvalues and their translation into circuits of capital.  \n \nThe moment of exchange is a critical one as commodities move from the \nrealm of exchange value to use value and the value (including the surplus-\nvalue) embodied in them is realised in monetary form and once again \nbecomes money capital, and as such available to be thrown into the \ncirculation process and advanced as capital for re-investment. The sale of \ncommodities thus forms a decisive moment in the circuit of capital. Some \ncommodities are sold to form inputs to other processes of production and the \nvalue embodied in them is transferred to new commodities. This \u201eproductive \nconsumption\u201f is expressed in relations between firms and supply chains, often \nstretching around the world as a consequence of the production strategies of \nthe TNCs and MNCs that construct and drive GPNs. For those commodities \nsold for final consumption, subsequent processes of consumption ensure that \ncommodities move from the realm of exchange to that of use values. At the \nsame time, they move from the life-worlds and workplaces of those that \nproduced them and become part of the material life worlds of those who \nconsume them and are otherwise affected by their consumption. Often \u2013 \nincreasingly \u2013 these life-worlds are widely separated, to be found in distant \nparts of the world, as GPNs involve segmenting the global economy into \ndiscrete spaces of production, exchange and consumption for a given \ncommodity. In addition, the subsequent post-sale life of things may, at the end \nof their useful lives to their initial purchasers or users, lead to their re-\nvalorisation and use by others or to their categorisation as \u201ewasted\u201f and no \nlonger things with a use value (a point again taken up below in more detail). \n \nIn summary, the asymmetrical interdependencies between both people, as a \nresult of their socio-spatial positionality, and concepts of value emphasise that \ncapitalist economies involve complex and multiple flows of values, underlain \nby different conceptions of value. More generally, the fundamental point within \na CPE approach is that conceptions and circuitous flows of value vary with the \nform and type of economic organisations under consideration and the \npositionality of those constructing the category of value. This positionality, \nespecially in terms of class relations, in turn is pivotal in determining which \nconcepts of value become dominant, and the ways in which circuits of value \nbecome constructed.  In similar fashion, relationships between capitalist and \nother non-capitalist forms of class relations and economy become constructed \nin ways that reflect differential power relations and this is of very direct \nrelevance to the construction of GPNs.  \n \nMuch recent literature in the \u201enew economic geography\u201f (NEG) and cognate \ndisciplines has emphasised the role of relations of trust, non-market \ninstitutions and untraded interdependencies (Storper, 1995) forged in civil \nsociety as well as in the economy itself as both helping constitute and \nCultural Political Economy Meets Global Production Networks: A Productive Meeting? \n \n 8 \nregulate the social relations of the contemporary economy, including those \ndenoted by the concept of GPNs. The cultural and institutional \u201eturns\u201f have \nplaced heavy emphasis on such influences. There is no doubt that such \ninfluences can be significant in reproducing the social relations of the \neconomy in particular times and places and in linking these places together as \nnodes in its constitutive circuits and GPNs. Equally, contra much of the recent \nNEG literature, I would argue that these influences are not new; indeed, they \nhave been significant in the constitution of capitalist economies from the \noutset (for example, see Carney et al, 1977). What is new is the claim as to \nthe discovery of their contemporary significance as part of a new form of \ncapitalist socio-spatial organisation by proponents of the NEG (cf. Hall, 1991).  \n \nAlongside this, however, and in contrast to much recent literature, I argue that \nit is necessary to pay attention to the continuing role of the national state in \nshaping these circuits and networks and the ways in which they are \nreproduced, as well as giving due recognition to other regulatory mechanisms \nand processes. The increased regulatory significance of both sub-national \nstates and transnational policy r\u00e9gimes is undeniable. However, national \nstates help constitute these other scales of regulation and co-exist in complex \nrelationships with them so that the architecture of regulation is much more \nnuanced, subtle and multi-scalar. Nonetheless, both directly and indirectly \nnational states continue to play an important role in shaping a range of \ncommodity markets, such as those for products, labour, and knowledge and \nso in shaping the spatiality of regulatory spaces. This is recognised in the \nvarieties-of-capitalism literature and in the various strands of the regulationist \napproach (see Jessop and Sum, 2006), while at the same time \nacknowledging that the national cannot be a priori assumed to the main \u2013 or \neven less, the sole \u2013 scale of regulatory capacity. The point to emphasise is \nthat while there has been growing regulatory influence at both sub-national \nand transnational scales, the (national) state continues to play a key role in \nensuring that GPNs and the improbable processes of capital accumulation \nand the expanded reproduction of the circuit of capital are routinely made \npossible. \n \n \nCircuits of meaning, flows of knowledge: advertising, brands and the \ncirculation of capital  \n \nThe process of production within the circuit of industrial capital results in \ncommodities that embody surplus-value \u2013 they embody more value than the \ncommodities that were consumed in their production, precisely because of the \nunique attributes of the commodity labour-power and the fact that human \nlabour creates more value than the value equivalent of the money received in \nthe form of wages. However, until these commodities are sold, the value \u2013 to \nthe capitalist \u2013 that they contain remains locked up, unavailable for further \ninvestment. For that value to be released in money form, so that it can again \nbecome money capital, the commodities must be sold. How and why should \nthis happen?  \n \nCultural Political Economy Meets Global Production Networks: A Productive Meeting? \n \n 9 \nTo be sold, commodities must be seen to be useful to their purchasers \u2013 to \nhave use value \u2013 and this in turn implies that they are seen as meaningful in \nthe context of their life worlds. Such meanings may relate to strictly utilitarian \naspects of commodities (for example, sheet steel purchased by automobile \nproducers) or, increasingly in the case of final consumers, their affective \ndimensions and culturally-coded symbolic meanings. The sale of commodities \nthus depends upon flows of information from their producers to potential \npurchasers, both other companies (buying commodities as inputs to the \nproduction of other commodities) and purchasers of commodities for \u201efinal\u201f \nconsumption (although in practice many consumer goods are then re-sold on \nto others by their initial purchasers or recipients). In the context of GPNs, this \nimplies that knowledge about commodities flows globally and commodities \ncome to have shared meanings for people in different parts of the world. In \nthis global context, advertising plays a critical role in the production and \ndissemination of knowledge about commodities, the creation of conceptual \nspaces of meaning and sale, seeking to construct intended meanings for them \nin the eyes of potential purchasers and consumers. Often, however, these \nintended meanings are contested and challenged, creating instead \nunintended meanings as a result of consumer resistance and subversion. \nProducers may respond to this by changing the projected image of the \nproduct through advertising or materially alter the commodity that they are \ntrying to sell (Hudson, 2005, Chapter 4). \n \nWhile now central to the contemporary global economy and the reproduction \nof GPNs, it is only quite recently that advertising has been more than a \nmarginal influence on patterns of sales and production (Williams, 1980, 177-\n86). The formation of modern advertising was intimately bound up with the \nemergence of new forms of monopoly capitalism around the end of the \nnineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century as one element in corporate \nstrategies to create, organise and where possible control markets, especially \nfor mass produced consumer goods. Mass production necessitated mass \nconsumption, and this in turn required a certain homogenisation of consumer \ntastes for final products. At its limit, this involved seeking to create \u201cworld \ncultural convergence\u201d, to homogenise consumer tastes and engineer a \n\u201cconvergence of lifestyle, culture and behaviours among consumer segments \nacross the world\u201d (Robins, 1989, 23). The qualification \u201cconsumer segments\u201d \nis crucial here for globalisation does not imply the elimination of variations in \nconsumer preferences and lifestyles but rather the socio-spatial segmenting \nof markets across the globe. \n \nThe development of modern advertising drew heavily on psychological \ntheories about how to create subjects, enabling advertising and marketing to \ntake on a \u201cmore clearly psychological tinge\u201d (Miller and Rose, 1997, cited in \nThrift, 1999, 67). Increasingly, the emphasis in advertising has switched from \nproviding \u201cfactual\u201d information to the symbolic connotations of commodities, \nsince the crucial cultural premise of advertising is that the material object \nbeing sold is never in itself enough. Even those commodities providing for the \nmost mundane necessities of daily life must be imbued with symbolic qualities \nand culturally endowed meanings via the \u201cmagic system (Williams, 1980) of \nadvertising. In this way and by altering the context in which advertisements \nCultural Political Economy Meets Global Production Networks: A Productive Meeting? \n \n 10 \nappear, things \u201ccan be made to mean \u201ejust about anything\u201f\u201d (McFall, 2002, \n162) and the \u201csame\u201d things can be endowed with different intended meanings \nfor different individuals and groups of people, thereby offering mass produced \nvisions of individualism. As such, representations of the consumer are a \nnecessary component of the existence of markets. Consequently, \ncontemporary capitalism could not function and GPNs could not exist as they \ndo without advertising.  \n \nConsumers are susceptible to influence via advertising precisely because, as \na result of their locations in specific socio-spatial-temporal structures, they \nhave \u2013 and can only have - imperfect and partial knowledge of commodities \nand markets. This creates space for companies actively to seek to change or \ncreate consumer tastes and cultivate preferences for new products. Moreover, \nadvertising practice \u201cconstantly problematises the entire notion of \u201especific \nproducts\u201f and constitutes a set of technologies for attempting both to de-\nstabilise markets and then to re-institutionalise them around new, strategically \ncalculated product definitions\u201d. In an environment in which markets and \nproducts are \u201ccontinuously and dynamically changing ... advertising focuses \non exploiting these environmental conditions, creating variations between \nproduct concepts as a means to reconfigure both consumer demand and \ncompetitive market structures\u201d (Slater, 2002, 68-73). This powerfully \nemphasises the way in which advertising practices and products can be \ncentral to the re-definition of markets via re-creating the intended meanings of \ncommodities as advertising signs and symbols are progressively de-coupled \nfrom specific commodities and so to the prosecution of destabilising \u201cmarket \ndisturbing\u201d strategies of strong Schumpeterian competition of the TNCs and \nMNCs that drive GPNs. \n \nWhile there may well be limits to the de-coupling of brand logos and their \nmeaning from specific commodities, as particular objects need to maintain a \ndegree of stability of meaning in order that they can perform as commodities \nand so enable markets to be (re)produced (Hudson, 2004), the de-coupling of \nsigns and symbols from any specific referent product has been further extended \nwith the growing emphasis on the promotion of brands as opposed to \nadvertising specific commodities. The increasing decoupling of signs and \nsymbols from specific commodities has been a crucial move in the creation of \nglobal markets and GPNs. The increasing prevalence of \u201cenormously powerful \nand ubiquitous global brands or logos\u201d with a \u201cfluid-like power\u201d stems from the \nways in which \u201cthe most successful corporations over the last two decades have \nshifted from the actual manufacture of products to become brand producers, \nwith enormous marketing, design, sponsorship, public relations and advertising \nexpenditures\u201d (Urry, 2001, 2). While retaining their pivotal HQ, design and \nmarketing functions in the core of the global economy, the  production of \nmaterial commodities and increasingly associated service functions has been \nshifted to new locations in the global economy (above all in the current decade, \nChina and India). As such, it signals a major change in the character of \ncontemporary accumulation and the spatiality of GPNs, but it is important to \nstress that the creation of brands is a well-established development across a \nwide spectrum of commodities.  Brands typically are tied to specific proprietary \nmarkers, such as hieroglyphs or logos (for example, the curly script and \nCultural Political Economy Meets Global Production Networks: A Productive Meeting? \n \n 11 \ncurvaceous bottle that encourage people al over the world to drink coca cola) or \na particular person (such as David Beckham, Richard Branson, Venus Williams \nor Tiger Woods), which both distinguish the brand and define particular brand \nfamilies (Klein, 2000) and can be recognised all around the globe. Such logos \nare deliberately targeted and intended to force the viewer, wherever and \nwhoever they may be, to take notice of them, \u201cto underscore the capacity of the \nbrand to condense its message to its mark\u201d (Franklin et al, 2000, 69). This \ncapacity is partly a result of extensive processes of market research and \npromotion and of the ways in which the phatic inscriptions of the brand create \nand maintain links among product items, lines and assortments. \n \nProprietary markers for brands thus operate as phatic images (Virilio, 1991), \nimages that target attention, synthesise perception. As a result, \u201cthe time of the \nbrand is that of the instantaneity of recognition and thus discrimination: brands \nwork through the immediacy of their recognisability\u201d (Lury, 2000, 169). As a \nphatic image, the brand works to displace or de-contextualise bodily or \nbiographical memory and re-contextualise it within its own body of expectations, \nunderstandings and associations, built up through market research, advertising, \npromotion, sponsorship and the use of themed retail space and manipulation of \nan object\u201fs environment or time\/space context. As a result, brand owners \nfrequently present branded objects in serially-repetitive themed spaces of \nexchange and sale - parks, restaurants, pubs and shops - or contribute to the \nelaboration of themed lifestyles through the sponsoring of events or activities. \nThe result is that \u201cthese brands are free to soar, less as the dissemination of \ngoods and services than as collective hallucinations\u201d (Klein, 2000, 22). This \ncreation of such distinct \u201c(hallucinatory) spaces of brands\u201d can extend across \nparticular social strata scattered across the globe and exemplifies the dynamic \ndialectic between spaces and circuits of meanings as part of the process of \n(re)producing GPNs. \n \nThe significance of the brand as a phatic image is that it can, to an extent, \n\u201crecoup the effects of the subject or consumer\u201fs perception as the outcome of its \nown powers through an assertion of its ability to motivate the product\u201fs meaning \nand use. This is achieved through the ways the brand operates to link the \nsubject and object in novel ways, making available for appropriation aspects of \nthe experience of product use as if they were the properties of the brand\u201d \u201d \n(Franklin et al, 2000, 68-9, emphases in original). More precisely, this is the \nintended way in which the potential purchaser should read the brand and be \nprepared to pay a premium for acquiring it. Purchasers who are able to thus pay \nfor the brand name, the aesthetic meaning and cultural capital that this confers, \nrather than for the use value of the commodity per se. What matters is capacity \nto pay, irrespective of where in the world a person lives. These aesthetic and \ncultural meanings of brands and sub-brands then become ways of socio-\nspatially segmenting markets by ability to make the premium payments required \nto possess the desired brand. Successful global brands, such as Benetton, \nBodyshop, Ford, Gap, Jurassic Park, Nike, McDonald\u201fs, Starbucks, Virgin, have \nbecome powerful precisely because they have succeeded in the creation of \n\u201cfamily resemblances\u201d, a form of commodity kinship through which commodities \nbecome seen as sharing essential characteristics: \u201cthe shared substance of their \nbrand identities\u201d (Franklin et al, 2000, 69) thus becomes available to those who \nCultural Political Economy Meets Global Production Networks: A Productive Meeting? \n \n 12 \ncan and are prepared to pay for the cachet of the brand, irrespective of where \nthey happen to live around the globe.  Global commodity flows are then shaped \nby the distribution of specific groups of consumers, whose tastes and \npreferences have in turn been shaped by the advertising strategies of the global \ncorporations that produce those commodities, whose identities have been   \nconstructed around the consumption of particular goods and brands (Lash and \nUrry, 1994, 140-1). In strong opposition to those who argue the case for \n\u201cconsumer sovereignty\u201d, Williams (1980, 193) emphasises that \u201cin economic \nterms, the fantasy operates to project the production decisions of the major \ncorporations as \u201eyour\u201f choice, the \u201econsumer\u201fs selection of priorities, methods \nand style\u201d. With the development and global diffusion of the mass media, \nespecially TV, advertising linked to the emergence of dominant brands has \nbecome a greatly enhanced \u201cmagic system\u201d via more powerful and persuasive \nprocesses of sign production that penetrate into the day-to-day life-worlds and \nliving spaces of people across the globe. \n \nOthers argue that such a perspective over-emphasises the power that \nadvertisers, allied to retailers, can exert over consumers (Jackson, 1993). \nAdvertising is rarely the sole or even most important source of pre-purchase \nknowledge about the existence or qualities of particular commodities, \u201cseldom \nthe single stimulator of wants and desires\u201d (Pred, 1996, 13). According to Lash \nand Urry (1994, 277), consumers have become less susceptible to the \nillusions of mass consumption than was once the case. While true with \nrespect to specific places and social groups, however, this is certainly not the \ncase universally. They claim that people are increasingly reflexive about their \nsociety, its product and its images, \u201calbeit images which are themselves part \nof what one might term a semiotic society\u201d.  This raises critical questions as to \nwhich people have the capacity to become \u201cactive consumers\u201d. While this \nclaim may have validity in some socio-spatial circumstances \u2013 for example, \nthat fraction of the new middle class endowed with ample cultural capital and \nwriting about itself?  \u2013 there are evident dangers in over-generalisation here. \nThere is, for example, little evidence of people becoming \u201cactive consumers\u201d \nover much of marginalised places of Europe and North America, let alone \nsub-Saharan Africa, as different people, their life worlds and spaces are \nincluded in or excluded from GPNs. \n \nTo better appreciate the significance of processes of advertising and branding \nrequires a more nuanced and non-linear view of the production and circulation \nof meanings as a continuous process. The starting point is the creation, within \ngiven social conditions, of a series of texts by producers, which are then read \nand interpreted by different audiences according to their social conditions, \npositionality and lived cultures. Audiences undertake the cultural work of \ninterpretation and their culturally constructed knowledges therefore play a key \nrole in the decoding and interpreting media messages and the ways in which \nadverts are understood. Such understandings, and the acceptance or \ncontestation of messages, are likely to vary significantly between time\/spaces \nand types of people. Moreover, this process of decoding is not simply a \nsemiotic process; the uses to which people put things are a major factor in the \ndetermination of meaning. This work of interpretation can in turn give rise to \nrecursive feedback loops from consumers to producers, and learning by \nCultural Political Economy Meets Global Production Networks: A Productive Meeting? \n \n 13 \nproducers from consumers. Recognition that advertisements are \u201eread\u201f in \nways that are culturally constructed and vary over time\/space and with the \nclass, gender, ethnicity, age and so on of the \u201ereader\u201f, allows companies to \nuse advertising strategies as a way of segmenting markets by seeking to \ncreate meanings that are specific to these segments. In this sense, \nadvertising is an inherently spatial practice, creating and differentiating circuits \nand spaces of meaning as integral elements of GPNs. \n \nThis recognition of the socio-spatial segmentation of markets renders \nredundant conceptions of globalization that postulate the creation of a \nhomogeneous global market. Indeed, they simply miss the point.  One has \nonly to consider the changes to the advertising strategies for Coca-Cola to \nappreciate this. After decades of a strategy based on the message of \u201eone \nsight, one sound, one sell\u201f, Coca Cola has sought to devise an advertising \nstrategy that seeks to respond to local specificities and \u201eto make Coca Cola \nappeal to every type of consumer, of every culture and nation, on every \noccasion'\u201f(Mitchell, 1995, cited in Hudson, 2005). This exemplifies the way in \nwhich major multinationals are increasingly recognising the need to be aware \nof spatial differentiation in order to be successful globally and reproduce their \nGPNs. Increasingly they are devolving responsibility to local branches or \nagencies for creating adverts that are customised to local conditions \u2013 \nvariations on a global theme, but tailor-made to fit local circumstances, \nincreasingly multi-local rather than variations on a multinational theme. It is, \nhowever, important to recognise that these are very socio-spatially selective \nprocesses of inclusion in and exclusion from the spaces of GPNs.  \n \nFinally, while recognising that people can contest the intentions of advertisers, \nso that they \u201cdo not straightforwardly draw upon meanings prescribed by \nretailers and advertisers\u201d but contest and re-work commodity meanings (Leslie \nand Reimer, 1999, 433, emphasis added), there are dangers in going too far in \ncelebrating consumer autonomy, reflexivity and resistance. While the process \nmay not be straightforward, advertising undoubtedly can exert enormous \ninfluence in mediating and shaping the changing relationship between the sign \nvalues of commodities, their symbolic meanings, and their material content and \nform (Fine and Leopold, 1993, 28). Most fundamentally, companies continue to \nrealise surplus-value via the successful sale of commodities, suggesting that \ntheir advertising and brand strategies have considerable efficacy in relation to \nreproducing capital on an expanded scale and in reproducing GPNs.  \n \n \nMaterial circuits, flows of matter \n \nAs noted above, there is recognition of the materiality of the economy in \nMarx\u201fs own writing and in subsequent Marxian political economy but, in \ncontrast to analyses of issues such as the labour process, value creation and \nthe circulation of capital, this has remained relatively underdeveloped. While \ncultural and semiotic issues have been much more thoroughly integrated via \nthe development of CPE, allowing a more integrated treatment of issues of \nconsumption, exchange and production, consideration of the economy in \nterms of materiality and flows of matter has remained largely conspicuous by \nCultural Political Economy Meets Global Production Networks: A Productive Meeting? \n \n 14 \nits absence. It is an absence that needs addressing, not least as it may well \nhave implications for our understanding of processes of value creation and \nthe creation of meanings.  \n \nIrrespective of the specific social relationships of a given economy, economic \nactivity involves the application of human labour, deploying a variety of artefacts \nand tools, to transform and transport elements of nature to become socially \nuseful and valued products. In emphasising the articulation of people with \ninanimate objects and tools to produce the materials transformations that give \nrise to material goods, there are clear resonances with the \u201eperformativity \nprogramme\u201f (Callon, 2006). Every economic activity \u2013 production, exchange, \nconsumption \u2013 therefore necessarily involves material transformations, \nchemical and physical transformations of matter from one state to another but \nmaterials transformations that chronically exceed their intended effects, as \nunruly matter escapes the frame defined by a given transformative process. \nConsequently at every stage in the economy the transformation of materials \nhas both intended and unintended \u2013 the latter often invisible or otherwise \nundetected as well as unwanted \u2013 effects. This leads to a conceptualisation of \nthe economy as a complex socio-technical process with emergent effects, \nwith important implications for a CPE perspective. Any production process in \nturn always depends upon a particular material configuration of the means of \nproduction, an assortment of tools, artefacts, machines and so on (that is, an \nassemblage, or ensemble, of fixed capital within the social relations of \ncapital), itself the product of previous materials transformations, that both \nenables new forms of transformation and is itself continuously transformed by \nthis process4.  \n \nRecognising that the production of excess is a chronic feature of economies \nhas important implications. Not least, we need to re-consider how we \nunderstand the category of \u201e\u201fwaste\u201f and the ways in which \u201ewaste\u201f is produced \nand this offers a productive route into consideration of the broader issue of the \nmateriality of the economy and the material register of a CPE approach. \nConventionally \u201ewaste\u201f is seen as the end-of pipe\/end-of-process unwanted \nand unvalued product of a linear process. In contrast, the concept of \u201ewaste\u201f \nthat emerges here is one of \u201ewaste\u201f as endemic and unavoidable, an \nunintended consequence of every stage in the economy, every material \ntransformation. From the point of view of capital such wastes represent value \nlost and so there are pressing imperatives both to minimise waste production \nand to find new uses for such materials as do become wastes and to re-\nvalorise them, so that materials that, from the perspective of one set of \neconomic processes have become wastes, literally wasted, once again \nbecome sources of value. \n \nA corollary of viewing the economy in this way is that the environmental \nfootprint (Jackson, 1995) of a GPN or indeed any socio-spatial form of \norganising economic activity and its practices, its socio-ecological and socio-\nspatial distribution, is always a mixture of intended and unintended effects and \n                                                 \n4\n There is a certain resemblance here to Sraffa\u201fs (1962) ideas as to the production of \ncommodities by means of commodities but the point is that this applies to all forms of \nproduction, not just the commodity form.  \nCultural Political Economy Meets Global Production Networks: A Productive Meeting? \n \n 15 \nattempts to ameliorate the undesirable effects of both. Consider for example \nthe production of steel: as well as the desired product, this gives rise to waste \ngases produced from the blast furnaces and BOS steel shops; slag produced \nfrom blast furnaces; off-cuts of steel generated from the continuous casting \nmachines and rolling mills; and so on. This in turn directs attention towards \nthose practices that seek to reduce wastes by improving the efficiency of \nproduction processes, by re-cycling surplus at every stage in these processes \n(such as off-cuts of steel in steel mills), of finding ways of using wastes (such \nas using slag in construction), of finding new uses for products that have \nreached the end of their (original) socially useful life and so on. In this sense \n\u201ewaste\u201f is endemic but so too are strategies to seek to reduce it and re-\nvalorise materials, in part for reasons of economic efficiency and \ncompetitiveness, in part because of ethical and moral concerns about waste \nin a society characterised by inequality and the ecological consequences of \nwastes. An important corollary of viewing wastes in these ways is that they \nand their effects become seen as endemic in the life-worlds of virtually \neveryone, and not simply in the life worlds of production in which they are \ncreated. Indeed, the consequences of wastes on the health and well-being of \npeople, especially marginalised people in marginalised spaces as these \nbecome the destination of wastes produced elsewhere and\/or the location of \nheavily polluting activities (such as nuclear waste reprocessing) is an issue of \nmajor significance as spaces of waste are created as an integral part of \nGPNs. As any form of production, transport and consumption has a varied \nenvironmental footprint, the issue is not whether or not GPNs have such an \necological footprint but rather what sort of footprint they have and what the \nsocio-ecological and socio-spatial distribution of this footprint is. Such issues \nhave yet to be integrated within a GPN perspective, however.  \n \nThe proposition that the economy can be productively conceived in terms of \nmaterials transformations can be explored further via drawing upon \nconceptualisations of the economy in terms of flows of energy and chemical \nand physical transformations of elements of nature that leave an unavoidable \ntrace, with the laws of thermodynamics providing key insights in understanding \nthese processes of materials transformation. Crucially, thermodynamics \ncharacterises any material transformation as conservative of materials and \ndissipative of energy. The conservation of materials is further discussed below \nbut it is important at this point to note the critical systemic implications of the \nsecond law and the dissipation of energy in relation to entropy. As a result \nthere is a constant tendency to disorder in the universe. Whilst order can be \npreserved locally, for example within a given socio-ecological system, this is \non the basis of imported flows of energy - ultimately from the sun but in \nrelation to the contemporary socio-ecological system, on the basis of carbon-\nbased sources of energy such as coal, oil and natural gas. Consuming such \nsources of energy, however, results in emissions of greenhouse gases that in \nturn pose a threat to the continuing viability of the system (see Hudson, 2001, \nChapter 9).  The limits that these laws unavoidably impose upon any form of \neconomic activity at all scales are critical and in the context of Global \nProduction Networks, linking diverse activities and locations around the globe, \nthese limits may be particularly acute.  \n \nCultural Political Economy Meets Global Production Networks: A Productive Meeting? \n \n 16 \nEach industrial process and economic activity necessarily involves the \ntransformation of materials and energy from one form to another; this is an \nunavoidable truth. The laws of thermodynamics provide very specific rules \nand limits that govern these transformations; they cannot be altered or \nsuspended by human intervention and in that sense set natural limits on \nsocial production and its relationships to nature (Georgescu-Roegen, 1971). \nAcknowledgement of such limits is, I would argue, a progressive move:\u201d \u2026 in \nthe face of realities which are genuinely invulnerable to human intentionality, \nadaptation by modifying or even abandoning our initial aspirations [to control \nnature] is to be recognised as a form of emancipation\u201d  (Benton, 1989, 58). \nThe laws of thermodynamics state that energy is neither created nor \ndestroyed during these transformations although it may change in physical \nform (for example, from kinetic energy to heat) and that the total mass of \ninputs to a transformation process is equal to the total mass of outputs. This \nidentity also holds at the level of individual atomic elements during (non-\nnuclear) material transformations. Inputs that do not emerge as desired \nproducts therefore necessarily appear as unwanted by-products or wastes. \nCrucially, however, in contrast to linear conceptions of the economy which \nsee \u201ewastes\u201f as the end product of linear processes, in the perspective of a \ncritical CPE \u201ewastes\u201f are seen as created at each and every stage of a \ntransformative process as this exceeds the capacity of the processes to \ncontain them as intended, so creating an unwanted surplus. This in turn has \nimplications for conceptualising the economy in terms of GPNs. \n \nFurthermore, this focus upon the flow of materials and material \ntransformations emphasises that the economy can be thought of as a (non-\nlinear) sequence of configurations, each of which \u201cis more or less a transient \nevent, a temporary (possibly long-lived but temporary) use of some set of \natoms and energy\u201d. Moreover, as Frosch (19, 159) puts it, neatly summarising \na well-established set of concerns, \u201cwe can postulate a universe of \nmaterial\/energy paths through the production, life, and dissolution of any \nproduct or set of products. We can also consider each path to be a sequence \nof transformations from one material\/energy embodiment to another. We can \nview the whole of material industry as a network of such paths and \ntransformations, connected at each end (extraction of materials and disposal \nof products) to the environment external to the process and product and at \nplaces in the middle (disposal of incidental waste)\u201d. In referring to networks of \npaths and transformation, Frosch offers a perspective that seeks to \nemphasise the complexity of the economy and its grounding in continuous \nflows and transformations of matter. From this perspective, GPNs can be \nseen as a particular spatio-temporal \u201efixing\u201f of matter and material flows, held \nin place by socially specific regulatory practices.   \n \nThis conception of economic practices as materials transformations in \nprinciple allows precise accounting of their environmental impacts. \nConsequently, it also provides the conceptual basis for industrial ecology and \nthe methodologies of life cycle analysis and industrial metabolism that seek to \nconstruct a set of accounts that centre on the notion of mass balance - that is, \nthat the sum total of a particular chemical within a production process remains \nconstant as it passes from production, to consumption, to disposal, with the \nCultural Political Economy Meets Global Production Networks: A Productive Meeting? \n \n 17 \nsocial relations and institutions within which people behave providing the \nstabilising controls. However, while recognising the value of these \nmethodologies as accounting frameworks and reminding us that there are \nchemical and physical limits to economic practices, my purpose in drawing \nupon them here is a different one; that is, to emphasise the ways in which \nmatter changes state as it moves through the economy in flows that are \nsocially shaped, with both intended and unintended effects. Once materials \npass from one particular process, configuration and state, they simply re-enter \nthe stream of the flow of matter until this flow is interrupted by their \nincorporation into another such socially-constructed process and their \nconfiguration in new ways \u2013 for example, in a new GPN. Moreover, the \nparticular (bio)chemical and physical characteristics of particular \nconfigurations are crucial in shaping, if not quite determining, the possibilities \nfor creating values. Consider, for example, the complex of materials flows and \ntransformations within a major integrated chemicals complex and those within \na clothing factory and the differing ways in which the characteristics of the \nvarying materials and matter with which they work, their capacities and \n(chemical and physical) properties, influences the configurations into which \nthey can be formed and held for varying periods of time and embody value, \nhow they can be transformed into commodities for which markets can be \ncreated and the value embodied in them realised through sale. In terms of the \nrelationships between processes of value creation and material flows and \ntransformations, these specificities are therefore critical.  Now of course \ncapitalist production is an inherently speculative and risky activity, with all \nmanner of possibilities of technical failure and breakdowns in the social \nrelations of production within and between firms. As a result, there is no \nguarantee that commodity production will be successful and the circuit of \ncapital completed \u2013 in that sense economies are always path contingent \nrather than path dependent (Hudson, 2004). But the point is that the very \npossibilities of specific sorts of commodity production \u2013 and particular forms of \nGPN - necessarily depend upon the sorts of materials configurations in which \nmatter of particular sorts can be captured and held.  \n \nWhile it is the case that there is some attention paid to issues of materiality in \nthe social sciences and this is valuable and informative, it is also the case that \nit is partial and limited. Material analysis in cultural anthropology and other \nparts of the social sciences is concerned with the meaning and representation \nof the material forms of artefacts, the ways they are represented and the \nmeanings they come to have. This is fine as far as it goes but it remains \nfocused upon issues of representation of the material form rather than \naddressing the dynamics of the flow of matter from one form to another. CPE \nto date likewise has little if anything to say on these issues and this forms a \nmajor limitation. In short, both CPE and existing approaches to material \nanalysis in the social sciences focus on the moments of \u201einterruption\u201f of the \nflows and the fixing of matter into temporary configurations and forms via the \nsocial processes of the economy in particular places (for example as \ncommodities or other forms of material product), albeit in different ways5. \n                                                 \n5\n Nicky Gregson has suggested that this may be an overly-charitable interpretation of strands \nof cultural economy which simply take the process of \u201efixing\u201f for granted and focus upon the \nmeaning of forms and things.  \nCultural Political Economy Meets Global Production Networks: A Productive Meeting? \n \n 18 \nHowever, the laws of thermo-dynamics cannot be abolished or suspended by \nhuman intervention. Indeed, it is these that perhaps constitute the iron laws of \nthe economy as a temporary \u201einterruption\u201f of the continuous flow of matter. In \nthis sense, focussing upon the materiality of the economy poses some \ninteresting challenges and questions for those political economists for whom \n\u201esecond nature has been taken-for-granted, an unquestioned given.  \n \nEmphasising the material register of a more comprehensive CPE therefore \nhighlights the ways in which matter is conserved and energy dissipated during \nprocesses of transformation as they move through \u201ethe economy\u201f, configuring \nmatter in particular ways in the process of creating value. Conversely, the \npossibilities of value creation are in turn influenced by the chemical and physical \nproperties of that matter. Focusing on the materiality of the economy highlights \nthe point that wastes are endemic and as such represent value lost to capital - in \nturn offering possibilities of value creation if these waste materials can be \nconfigured in new ways to provide a new source of profit. In this way, we can \nobtain a deeper understanding of the relationships between processes of value \ncreation and material transformation and the ways in which material possibilities \nand barriers influence the substance of commodity production6. By tracing the \necological impacts of varying combinations of technologies of production, \nexchange and consumption, and of different levels and compositions of \noutput, the ecological implications of economic choices as to the composition \nof output and the socio-technical and socio-spatial configurations of various \nGPNs can be better understood. Equally the material effects of the \ndevalorisation of capital and the creation of industrial wastelands, landscapes \nof abandoned factories, plant and machinery that then lie unused and decay, \nbecoming transformed into new configurations of matter, can be better \ngrasped and comprehended.  This recognition of the significance of the \nmaterial register therefore provides a perspective from which to review the \necological implications of the repertoire of possible social choices about how \nand what to produce, exchange and consume and where to do so. It allows \nfuller consideration of the determinants of where production occurs, for \nexample in relation to companies' attempts to find \"spatial fixes\" for pollutant \nand environmentally noxious and hazardous production and, linked to this, to \nthe creation of \u201cregions of wastes\u201d, either regions that have always been on \nthe margins of the global economy or those that were once central to it but no \nlonger are, with such regions often in competition for the waged work that \nwaste disposal offers. There are, therefore, considerable potential benefits in \nconceptualising economies in terms of materiality and materials \ntransformation in thinking through different ways in which GPNs are currently \norganised and might in future be organised to ameliorate adverse ecological \nimpacts as well as to deepening understanding of the links between \nprocesses of value creation and material transformation \n \nIn summary, human societies and economies, however organised and whether \nor not conceptualised as GPNs, cannot escape the indeterminacies, \n                                                 \n6\n As noted above, for those who wish to pursue such an approach that focuses on material \ntransformations per se, there are methodologies, notably those of industrial metabolism and life \ncycle analysis, that allow a precise tracing of processes of the dissipation of energy and \nconservation of matter. \nCultural Political Economy Meets Global Production Networks: A Productive Meeting? \n \n 19 \nuncertainties and limits set by the laws of thermodynamics. It is, however \u201cquite \nanother thing to treat [these laws] as sufficient conditions for the understanding \nof human history\u201d (Harvey, 1996, 140). These laws set limits within which there \nis scope for varying determinations. There is a degree of room for manoeuvre \nwithin these limits, allowing GPNs to be shaped in one way or another, subject \nto the limits of political-economy and profitability. That said, these limits are non-\ntrivial. Because the global ecological\/economic system is complex and non-\nlinear, its dynamic behaviour is potentially chaotic and its stability, its tendency \nto remain within its original domain is indeterminate. Given the indeterminacy, \nthere are good reasons to exercise the precautionary principle in considering \nrelations between economy and environment. However, it remains an open \nquestion as to whether any form of economy, any set of social relations of \nproduction, any socio-spatial configuration of a GPN, can develop effective \nregulatory mechanisms to contain the consequences of human intervention into \nthe cycles of natural processes over the long-term.  \n \nConclusions \n \nHas the meeting between GPN and CPE been fruitful? I would argue that it \nhas. I have argued for a conception of CPE that encompasses a variety of \ncircuits, flows and spaces within the three registers of the political-economic, \nsemiotic and material. These co-constitutive circuits and flows intersect as \npeople, things, and knowledge flow into and out of spaces, both shaped by \nand shaping these spaces, linking them together into the intricacies of GPNs, \nconstituted in and of time\/space. Thus GPNs could become an extremely \npowerful way of representing \u201ethe economy\u201f in its essential complexity (that is \nwith emergent effects, an entity that is not just complicated but complex), of \nrepresenting the richness of the economy in terms of the links between the \naffective, cognitive and material, between circuits of value, meaning and \nmatter, between the moments of production, exchange and consumption, and \nbetween political economies grounded in different concepts of value and \nprocesses of valuation. In particular GPNs highlight the particular spatialities \nof the global economy and the way in which different spaces and the \neveryday lives of those that live and work in them are entangled with or \nexcluded from the processes of production, exchange and consumption \nthrough which GPNs are constituted. As a result, they bring together the \n\u201csystem\u2013world\u201d and the \u201clife world\u201d, the imperatives of the accumulation \nprocess with the experienced realities of everyday life for people in varied \nsites of production, exchange and consumption.  \n \nHowever, consideration of the material and of the materiality of the economy, \nof the relationships between economy and nature, has yet to be fully brought \ninto a CPE perspective. It remains an open question as to the extent to which \nserious consideration of materiality forces a re-interpretation of issues of value \nand meaning within a CPE perspective and the implications of this in turn for \nbringing together CPE and GPN perspectives. Not least taking materiality \nseriously requires crossing disciplinary boundaries not simply within the social \nsciences but between the social and material and physical sciences, with all \nthat this implies about different conceptions as to what constitutes valid \nknowledge and admissible evidence. As of now the GPN perspective gives \nCultural Political Economy Meets Global Production Networks: A Productive Meeting? \n \n 20 \nminimal attention to the materiality of networks and to the material \ntransformations that are, in practice, central to the constitution of GPNs. There \nis no doubt, however, that the material configurations in which matter can be \ntemporarily stabilised and held has important implications for the way in which \nmatter can be shaped to create value. Materialising GPN approaches \ntherefore presents a significant challenge to its advocates and proponents \u2013 \nbut also a significant opportunity to broaden the agenda of this exciting new \nway of thinking about economic geographies. \n \nAcknowledgments  \n \nMy thanks to the editors of this special issue, to two anonymous referees and \nto Nicky Gregson for constructive and helpful comments on an earlier draft of \nthis paper \n \nReferences \n \nBauman Z, 2005, Liquid Life, Polity, Cambridge. \nBenton T, 1989, \u201cMarxism and Natural Limits: An Ecological Critique and \nReconstruction\u201d, New Left Review, 178, 51-86. \n \nCallon M, 2006, \u201cWhy Virtualism paves the way to political impotence: a reply \nto Daniel Miller\u201fs critique of The Laws of the Market\u201d, Economic Sociology \nEuropean Electronic Newsletter, 6, 3-20.  \n \nCarney, J Hudson R and Lewis J, 1977, \u201cCoal Combines and Inter-regional \nUneven Development in the U.K\u201d in Batey, P.W. and Massey, D.

GPNs can be seen as encompassing the entirety \nof the circuit of production and to be constituted via a variety of flows (of \ncapital in various forms such as commodities and money, knowledge and \npeople) between a variety of nodes, sites and spaces (of production, \nexchange and consumption), with varying governance arrangements, both \nmulti-scalar (supra-national, national, regional and urban) and non-scalar \nnetworked forms of governance.  As these are Global Production Networks \nthese nodes and the flows linking them are, by definition, distributed around \nthe globe, albeit unevenly. CPE seeks to conjoin a more thorough treatment \nof the semiotic to more established concepts of political-economy and there \nhas been some considerable success in this regard (for example see Jessop \nand Sum, 2006), As yet, however, there has been little serious engagement \nwith the materiality of the economy and so with the relations between the \nmaterial, semiotic and political-economic within CPE. A similar criticism can \nbe made of work on GPNs. Integrating considerations of the materiality of the \neconomy more systematically enriches a CPE perspective, while exploring \ncommon ground between CPE and GPN approaches enables these \nadvantages to be translated into the latter and further enhance its conceptual \nreach. \n \n \n"}
