They are called sawtooth events because the shape of the flux versus time profiles are composed of rapid increases followed by gradual decreases that resemble the teeth on a saw blade. Although much of the phenomenology associated with sawtooth events is substorm-like, there is still debate as to whether the individual teeth are substorms or not. Here we examine each of the teeth associated with the 10\u201311 August 2000 sawtooth event in detail. We find that all but one of the teeth were associated with injections at geosynchronous orbit and that most of the teeth were consistent with the hypothesis that they are predominantly caused by unusually large and longitudinally extended substorms. A few were unclear or complex, and the final flux enhancement at 1845:36 UT was not a substorm but a solar wind shock-associated disturbance. In addition, the presence of numerous dispersionless flux perturbations in the LANL SOPA data provides support for the hypothesis that solar wind pressure variations can modulate the flux profiles to some extent. For the substorm events we find that the geosynchronous particle injections were neither globally simultaneous nor globally dispersionless but were instead consistent with a nightside\/duskside source in most cases. Similarly, we show that the field dipolarizations were also not global and simultaneous. Each of the substorms was also associated with high-latitude negative H bays, middle- and low-latitude positive H bays, a partial recovery in Sym-H, and the onset of Pi2 ULF pulsations. In addition, we show that the auroral distribution develops in a systematic way during each cycle of a sawtooth substorm event. Specifically, a localized auroral onset develops on the lower branch of a thinned double-oval distribution. The location of onset is typically premidnight and often occurs to the west of intense omega band forms. This is followed by westward, eastward, and poleward expansion and the copious production of auroral streamers which can develop in complex patterns including a \u201cspoke-like\u201d morphology. The double-oval configuration thins again during the stretching phase until the next onset occurs and the cycle repeats.

In addition, the presence of numerous dispersionless flux perturbations in the LANL SOPA data provides support for the hypothesis that solar wind pressure variations can modulate the flux profiles to some extent. For the substorm events we find that the geosynchronous particle injections were neither globally simultaneous nor globally dispersionless but were instead consistent with a nightside\/duskside source in most cases. Similarly, we show that the field dipolarizations were also not global and simultaneous. Each of the substorms was also associated with high-latitude negative H bays, middle- and low-latitude positive H bays, a partial recovery in Sym-H, and the onset of Pi2 ULF pulsations. In addition, we show that the auroral distribution develops in a systematic way during each cycle of a sawtooth substorm event. Specifically, a localized auroral onset develops on the lower branch of a thinned double-oval distribution. The location of onset is typically premidnight and often occurs to the west of intense omega band forms. This is followed by westward, eastward, and poleward expansion and the copious production of auroral streamers which can develop in complex patterns including a \u201cspoke-like\u201d morphology. The double-oval configuration thins again during the stretching phase until the next onset occurs and the cycle repeats. A schematic representation of the auroral dynamics associated with sawtooth substorms is also presented.<\/dc:description><dc:date>\n        2006<\/dc:date><dc:type>\n        Journal Article<\/dc:type><dc:type>\n        PeerReviewed<\/dc:type><dc:format>\n        application\/pdf<\/dc:format><dc:identifier>\n        http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/28045\/1\/art_779.pdf<\/dc:identifier><dc:relation>\n        http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1029\/2005JA011366<\/dc:relation><dc:identifier>\n        Henderson, M.

Although much of the phenomenology associated with sawtooth events is\nsubstorm-like, there is still debate as to whether the individual teeth are substorms or not.\nHere we examine each of the teeth associated with the 10\u201311 August 2000 sawtooth event\nin detail. We find that all but one of the teeth were associated with injections at\ngeosynchronous orbit and that most of the teeth were consistent with the hypothesis\nthat they are predominantly caused by unusually large and longitudinally extended\nsubstorms.

Introduction\n[2] Magnetospheric sawtooth events were first identified\nin the LANL geosynchronous particle data by Belian et al.\n[1995] as large-amplitude, quasiperiodic (i.e., not strictly\nperiodic) oscillations of the energetic particle fluxes. The\noscillations are particularly prominent in the energetic\nproton channels, they typically occur during storm intervals\nin the presence of an enhanced ring current, they have\na quasiperiodicity of approximately 2\u20134 hours, and they tend\nto be driven by moderate to strong (Bz \u0001 \u000210 nT) and\ncontinuously southward IMF conditions [e.g., see\nHenderson, 2004; Henderson et al., 2006; J. E. Borovksy\net al., The solar-wind driving of global sawtooth oscillations\nand periodic substorms: What determines the periodicity?,\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 111, A06206, doi:10.1029\/2005JA011366, 2006\n1Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico, USA.\n2Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Calgary, Calgary,\nAlberta, Canada.\n3Now at Solar-Terrestrial Physics Group, School of Physics and\nAstronomy, University of Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, UK.\n4Space Environment Center, NOAA, Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n5Department of Earth and Space Sciences, University of California, Los\nAngeles, California, USA.\n6Space Sciences Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley,\nCalifornia, USA.\n7NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland, USA.\n8Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Iowa, Iowa City,\nIowa, USA.\nCopyright 2006 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/06\/2005JA011366$09.00\nA06206 1 of 32\nsubmitted of Annals of Geophysics, 2005, hereinafter re-\nferred to as Borovsky et al., submitted manuscript, 2005].\nThey are called \u2018\u2018sawtooth\u2019\u2019 events because the flux versus\ntime profiles (rapid increases followed by more gradual\ndecreases) resemble the teeth on a saw blade.\n[3] The rapid flux increases and gradual decreases are\nassociated with dipolarization and stretching at geosynchro-\nnous orbit and while this activity is typically strongest on\nthe nightside (especially in the dusk-to-midnight sector), it\ncan extend past the terminators into the dayside (Borovksy\net al., submitted manuscript, 2005). In addition, Henderson\n[2004] showed that the strong nightside stretching and\ndipolarization can also extend well inside of geosynchro-\nnous orbit. Each tooth in a sawtooth event is also usually\nassociated with a partial recovery of the Sym-H index\n[Reeves et al., 2003; Huang et al., 2004a; Henderson,\n2004; Henderson et al., 2006]; energetic particle injections\n[Reeves et al., 2003; Huang et al., 2003a; Henderson, 2004;\nHenderson et al., 2006]; enhancements of energetic neutral\natom (ENA) emissions [Reeves et al., 2003; Huang et al.,\n2003a; Henderson et al., 2006]; pulses of low-charge-state\n(i.e., ionospheric origin) energetic oxygen [Henderson et\nal., 2006]; tail signatures of TCRs and plasmoids [Huang,\n2002; Huang et al., 2003b; Lui et al., 2004]; localized\nauroral onsets in the premidnight sector [Reeves et al., 2003;\nHenderson et al., 2006] which occur on the lower branch of\na thinned down double-oval configuration [Henderson et\nal., 2006]; auroral zone negative H bays [Huang et al.,\n2003a]; middle- and low-latitude positive H bays [Huang et\nal., 2004a]; Pi2 pulsations with substorm-like polarizations\nsignatures [Kitamura et al., 2005]; and unusually wide\nsubstorm-like current wedges [Kitamura et al., 2005].\n[4] At present there is still some debate as to whether\nsawtooth events are sequences of quasiperiodic substorms\nor some different type of global disturbance. Although\nBorovksy et al. (submitted manuscript, 2005) describe the\nindividual teeth as substorm-like, they distinguish them\nfrom isolated or periodic substorms because they tend to\nproduce disturbances that are more azimuthally distributed\nthan one might expect from typical substorms. In addition,\nLee et al. [2004] and Lee and Lyons [2004] contend that\nmany of the observational features present during sawtooth\nevents are not consistent with substorm behavior, but rather\nare global disturbances directly driven by SW (Solar Wind)\npressure enhancements. Although Lee et al. [2004] ac-\nknowledged that substorm effects could also be present\nduring the teeth, they suggested that the dominant magne-\ntospheric response is due to a global pressure effect and they\nexplicitly attribute many of the observational features that\none would normally associate with substorm activity to this\npressure effect. In more recent studies, Lee et al. [2005] and\nLyons et al. [2005] conclude that teeth can either be sub-\nstorms or that they are composed of a two-mode response: a\nglobal pressure effect and in some cases a substorm effect.\nHowever, Lyons et al. [2005] still explicitly attributes to\npressure effects, observational characteristics that have long\nbeen associated with substorm effects instead. Other studies\n[Reeves et al., 2003; Huang, 2002; Huang et al., 2003b;\nHenderson, 2004; Lui et al., 2004; Henderson et al., 2006;\nClauer et al., 2006] have concluded that sawtooth events are\nprimarily storm time substorms. It is also important to note\nthat others have examined sawtooth intervals as substorms\nin the past, before the term \u2018\u2018sawtooth event\u2019\u2019 was coined.\nFor example, the CDAW-9C event analyzed by Pulkkinen et\nal. [1991] and Baker et al. [1993] was considered to be a\nsubstorm, and the broader CDAW-9C interval (3 May 1986)\nwas analyzed by Minenko et al. [2000a, 2000b] as a \u2018\u2018chain\nof recurrent substorms.\u2019\u2019 However, as shown by Henderson\n[2004], this interval was also a sawtooth event.\n[5] In large part, the notion that sawtooth events may\nconstitute a new, previously unknown, mode of magneto-\nspheric behavior may be rooted in a number of unsubstan-\ntiated assumptions, perhaps the most egregious of which is\nthat sawtooth events produce simultaneous, globally dis-\npersionless energetic particle increases at geosynchronous\norbit. For example, Lee et al. [2004, paragraph 1] studied\nfour sawtooth events and claimed that \u2018\u2018during all four\nevents, nearly simultaneous energetic particle flux enhance-\nments and magnetic field variations occurred at all MLTs for\neach sawtooth cycle.\u2019\u2019 Furthermore, Borovksy et al. (sub-\nmitted manuscript, 2005) claim that \u2018\u2018with multiple satellites\nat geosynchronous orbit, the oscillations are seen nearly\nsimultaneously and in-phase at all local times.\u2019\u2019 In addition,\nlinks have been made between non-substorm-like pressure-\ndriven global auroral disturbances and sawtooth-like behav-\nior [e.g., see Lee and Lyons, 2004, paragraph 32]. (Although\nwe note that in a more recent study, Lyons et al. [2005]\ndistinguish between pressure-driven teeth and substorm-\nassociated teeth). The low- and middle-latitude positive H\nbays associated with many individual teeth have also\nbeen described as globally simultaneous and therefore not\nsubstorm-like [e.g., Lee and Lyons, 2003].\n[6] Since sawtooth events typically last for several hours\nto a day, plots showing data acquired over an entire event\n(i.e., plots showing many hours of data) certainly seem to\ngive the impression that each tooth is a globally simulta-\nneous disturbance. However, as shown by Henderson et al.\n[2006], more detailed examinations of individual teeth show\nthat the assumption of global simultaneity is typically not\nvalid (although the disturbances associated with some\nsawtooth events can in fact be quite broad). In addition,\nsince sawtooth events usually occur during anomalously\nhigh levels of solar wind driving (e.g., during solar wind\nmagnetic cloud events), it is important to recognize that the\nmagnetospheric response may be composed of more than\none type of disturbance. For example, although solar wind\nshocks typically induce a different type of magnetospheric\nresponse than substorms do, both types of disturbances may\nbe present in a single sawtooth interval. In this paper, we\nexamine each of the individual teeth contained in the 10\u201311\nAugust 2000 sawtooth event in detail in order to more\nclearly elucidate the nature of the underlying disturbances.\n2. Observations\n2.1. Geosynchronous and Auroral Behavior\n[7] Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) SOPA\nenergetic electron and proton spin-averaged differential flux\nmeasurements from three different locations around the\nEarth are presented in Figures 1a and 1b, respectively.\nThe time interval shown extends for thirty hours from\n1800 UT on 10 August 2000 to 2400 UT on 11 August\n2000. For the electron channels shown in Figure 1a, the\nenergy passbands are (from red to blue): 50\u201375 keV, 75\u2013\nA06206 HENDERSON ET AL.: 10\u201311 AUGUST 2000 SAWTOOTH EVENT\n2 of 32\nA06206\n105 keV, 105\u2013150 keV, 150\u2013225 keV, 225\u2013315keV, 315\u2013\n500 keV. For the proton channels shown in Figure 1b, the\nenergy passbands are (from orange to cyan) 75\u2013113 keV,\n113\u2013170 keV, 170\u2013250 keV, and 250\u2013400 keV. Higher-\nenergy channels (to several MeV) are available from the\nSOPA and ESP instruments and lower energy channels\n(extending from a few eV to about 40 keV) are available\nfrom the MPA plasma analyzer (and these will be described\nlater). Also shown in Figure 1 are the field inclination angle\nat GOES 8 (purple) and GOES 10 (green), the field\nmagnitude at GOES 8 (purple) and GOES 10 (green), the\nAU (blue) and AL (orange) indices, and the 1 min resolu-\ntion Sym-H index. Data from GOES 11 (which was situated\nbetween GOES 10 and GOES 8 during this time period) are\nalso available for this event and will be described later.\n[8] The vertical dashed lines in Figure 1 mark the onset\ntime of each sawtooth disturbance as indicated by a variety\nof different measures (not just the LANL geosynchronous\ndata). Later, when we examine each tooth in more detail, we\nwill discuss how each time was determined. For now, we\nnote that each time line clearly marks the onset of a large-\nscale disturbance that is seen in most or all of the curves\nshown in Figure 1. For each of the events, a sharp sawtooth-\nlike increase in the SOPA energetic proton fluxes is ob-\nserved. Flux increases in the energetic electrons are also\nobserved in association with most of the events, but they are\nnot as dramatic (or as sawtooth-like) as the proton increases.\n[9] The B field tilt angle at GOES 8 and GOES 10 plotted\nin Figure 1 is the angle between the magnetic field vector\nand the geocentric solar magnetospheric (GSM) equatorial\nplane (i.e., the x\u0002y axis). Thus an angle of 90\u0001 indicates that\nthe field direction is perpendicular to the GSM equatorial\nplane (i.e., dipole-like), while low angles indicate a more\ntail-like stretched configuration. Differences in the behavior\nand magnitude of the variations between the two GOES\nspacecraft can be attributed to the fact that they are at\ndifferent magnetic latitudes and at different local times.\nFrom Figure 1 we can see that all but the 2302:25 UT and\nFigure 1. Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) energetic electron and proton data from three\ngeosynchronous spacecraft stationed at various locations around the world together with field inclination\nangles at the GOES 8 and GOES 10 geosynchronous spacecraft, field magnitude at GOES 8 and GOES\n10, AU and AL indices, and 1 min resolution Sym-H index.

The vertical yellow and blue lines\nmark the time at which each satellite passed through local magnetic noon and midnight, respectively.\nVertical dashed lines mark the onset of each \u2018\u2018event\u2019\u2019 and are drawn at times 2302:25 UT (10 August),\n0041:29 UT, 0151:16 UT, 0413:28 UT, 0639:06 UT, 0818:06 UT, 1030:01 UT, 1330:58 UT, and\n1845:36 UT.\nA06206 HENDERSON ET AL.: 10\u201311 AUGUST 2000 SAWTOOTH EVENT\n3 of 32\nA06206\n1845:36 UT events were associated with a substantial field\ndipolarization at one or more of the GOES spacecraft.\nFor the 2302:25 UT and 1845:36 UT events, all of the\nGOES spacecraft were situated on the dayside and for the\n1330:01 UT event, GOES 8 was situated on the dayside.\nThus, for each event, a dipolarization was observed at a\nGOES satellite whenever it was situated on the nightside. In\naddition, the magnitude of the dipolarizations tend to be\nvery strong when the GOES spacecraft observed them in the\npremidnight sector and tend to be weaker when the space-\ncraft are away from that region.\n[10] For all of the events, a substantial increase in the\nmagnitude of the geosynchronous magnetic field was also\nobserved. For most of the events, the B field increases in a\npulse-like manner and appears to recover on a timescale\nsubstantially shorter than the intertooth period (of 2\u2013\n4 hours). However, the B field increase associated with\nthe 1845:36 UT event behaves differently in this regard. For\nthis last event, the B field appears to increase much more\npromptly, and as a level shift rather than as a pulse.\n[11] The auroral electrojet indices shown in Figure 1\nreveal that most of the events were associated with a\nnegative deflection in AL. Perturbations were also seen in\nAU for a number of the events, but their behavior is far less\nsystematic than the AL response. In addition, the AL\nresponse for the 1845:36 UT event was an extremely sharp\nand short-lived negative pulse unlike the more substorm-\nlike negative bays associated with the other events. The\n0041:29 UT event was also not associated with an obvious\nnegative bay in the AL index (but as we shall see this may\nhave been due to limitations in station coverage).\n[12] The bottom panel of Figures 1a and 1b shows that\nmost of the events were also associated with a partial\nrecovery in the Sym-H index. The one exception was the\n1330:01 UT event which showed a small strengthening of\nSym-H. Note that the evolution of the tooth-associated\nperturbations in Sym-H are very similar to the field mag-\nnitude increases seen at the GOES spacecraft. In particular,\nthe perturbations tend to be pulse-like for all except the\n1845:36 UT event which shows a very abrupt step-like\nincrease in Sym-H.\n[13] As pointed out recently by Henderson et al. [2006],\nthe dramatic quasiperiodic oscillatory nature of sawtooth\nevents is most easily seen in plots with time axes that span\nmany hours because at least 2\u20133 teeth (i.e., at least 4\u2013\n12 hours of data) are usually required to notice the sawtooth\ncharacter. For example, the sawtooth behavior of the geo-\nsynchronous energetic proton fluxes for the 10\u201311 August\n2000 event described here is very clear in the 30 hour plot\nshown in Figure 1. Note, however, that on such a long\ntimescale, many of the teeth appear to represent dipolariza-\ntion-associated dispersionless flux increases that occur\nsimultaneously at all locations around the Earth and it is\ntempting to conclude that the individual teeth represent\nsimultaneously global disturbances. For example, in a\nrecent study, Lee and Lyons [2004] contend that, for the\n10\u201311 August 2000 sawtooth event, there was a simulta-\nneous occurrence of nightside magnetic variations and\ndayside particle flux changes. Other studies have also\nalleged the simultaneity of each tooth-related disturbance\n[e.g., Lee et al., 2004; Borovksy et al., submitted manu-\nscript, 2005] and there appears to be a general impression in\nthe community that such simultaneity is a robust character-\nistic of sawtooth events. Nevertheless, we have found that\nmore detailed analyses of sawtooth intervals usually reveals\nthat the disturbances are typically not global nor simulta-\nneous in nature. This was recently demonstrated for a\nspecific case by Henderson et al. [2006].\n[14] It has also been claimed that the geosynchronous\nenergetic electron data \u2018\u2018show very similar flux oscilla-\ntions\u2019\u2019 to the proton data [e.g., Lee et al., 2004]. However,\nas shown by Henderson et al. [2006], this was not at all true\nfor the 18 April 2002 sawtooth event, and Lee et al. [2005]\nhave demonstrated that substantial differences can indeed\nexist between the electron and proton flux profiles. In\naddition, even in the 30 hour plot shown in Figure 1,\nelectron dispersion is quite apparent for the 10\u201311 August\n2000 event discussed here.\n[15] A further source of potential confusion also exists\nwhich has not been adequately addressed in previous\nstudies of sawtooth events, and that is that the SOPA P1,\nP6, and (often) the P2 channels respond to electrons and can\nbecome severely contaminated by medium energy electrons\nwhen their fluxes are high. Ignoring this feature of the\nLANL SOPA instrument can lead to an incorrect character-\nization of the electron versus proton flux increases.\nAlthough we have omitted the the SOPA proton P1 and\nP6 channels in this section, the P2 channel has been retained\nin most plots. However, one should be wary of features in\nthis channel that appear to be well correlated with the\nelectron fluxes (or seem markedly uncorrelated with the\nadjacent P3-P5 channels) and in some plots (to follow) we\nhave omitted the P2 channel altogether.\n[16] In order to clarify the behavior of the geosynchro-\nnous energetic particle flux increases and their association\nwith geosynchronous field dipolarizations and auroral acti-\nvations for the 10\u201311 August 2000 event, we turn now to a\nmore detailed examination of each tooth. In the following\nsubsections, we present the LANL geosynchronous ener-\ngetic electron and proton data over a 3 hour time window\nsurrounding the onset of each flux increase. In addition, the\nGOES 10, GOES 11 and GOES 8 magnetic field tilt angle\n(or field magnitude) increases are shown together with\nglobal auroral imaging data from Polar\/VIS or IMAGE\/\nFUV when available. To further aid in the interpretation of\nthe LANL SOPA energetic particle data, in Table 1 we have\ntabulated the drift times (gradient and curvature) for the\nupper energy threshold (i.e., fast particles) in each of the\nproton and electron energy channels. We used the approx-\nimate relativistic formula for a dipole given by Hess [1968],\ntD \u00bc 163:77h\nme\nm\n\u0001 \u0002 1\u00fe h\n2\u00fe h\n\u0003 \u0004\nF l\u00f0 \u00de\nL\n;minutes \u00f01\u00de\nwhere h is the ratio of the particle\u2019s kinetic energy to its rest\nenergy, me is the electron rest mass, m is the particle rest\nmass, L is the L shell parameter, and F(l) is a pitch-angle-\ndependent quantity ranging between 1.0 (for equatorially\nmirroring particles) and 1.5 (for particles with a mirror\nlatitude of 90\u0001). Note that the relativistic corrections for\nprotons in the SOPA energy range are very small because\nthe proton rest energy is much larger (E\u0001 = 0.938 GeV).\nHowever, since the rest energy of an electron is only\n0.511 MeV, relativistic corrections are significant over the\nA06206 HENDERSON ET AL.: 10\u201311 AUGUST 2000 SAWTOOTH EVENT\n4 of 32\nA06206\nentire SOPA energy range. For example, 1 Mev electrons\nwill drift slower than 1 MeV protons by a factor of about\n1.5.\n[17] For the IMAGE\/FUV WIC data, each image is\nshown in Apex Magnetic Coordinates with noon at the\ntop and midnight at the bottom. For the 1845:36 UT event,\nwe have subtracted the airglow signal in order to more\nclearly see the entire global distribution (see Immel et al.\n[2000] for details on the airglow removal technique), but for\nall other events, the dayglow has not been subtracted. The\nlatitude circles are drawn every 10\u0001 between 50\u0001 and 90\u0001.\nFor the Polar\/VIS data, each image is presented in its raw\nformat rather than a magnetic coordinate system.\n2.1.1. The 2302:25 UT, 10 August Event\n[18] An expanded 3 hour view of the LANL SOPA\nenergetic electron and proton fluxes is presented in\nFigures 2c and 2d, respectively. The MLT locations of the\nthree GOES spacecraft, the three LANL spacecraft, and the\nSAMNET\/YORK ground station at 2302:25 UT are shown\nin Figure 2a. Note that the dots in Figure 2a are only meant\nto show the MLT of each observing point and are therefore\ndrawn at arbitrary latitudes; that is, they should not be\ninterpreted as magnetic footprint locations. As shown, at\n2302:25 UT, GOES 10 and GOES 11 were in the postnoon\nsector and GOES 8 was situated just past the dusk termi-\nnator on the nightside. The 1989-046 spacecraft was situ-\nated near noon while the LANL-97A and 1994-084\nsatellites were situated in the predawn to dawn sector.\n[19] One can immediately see from Figure 2d that the\nproton flux increases were not dispersionless at any of the\nTable 1.

The energies are the same as shown in Figure 1.\nA06206 HENDERSON ET AL.: 10\u201311 AUGUST 2000 SAWTOOTH EVENT\n5 of 32\nA06206\nLANL spacecraft. In addition, none of the GOES spacecraft\nobserved a dipolarization signature in association with this\nevent. The onset time adopted for this event was therefore\nderived from the high-resolution, 1 s H component and Pi2-\nfiltered H component traces from the SAMNET\/YORK\nground magnetometer station as shown in Figure 2b.\n[20] From Figure 2d, we also note that the dispersion in\nthe proton fluxes is least at 1989-046 and increases at 1994-\n084 and LANL-97A which were farther to the west. In\naddition, the electron flux increases appear to show the\nreverse behavior, with the most dispersion seen at 1989-046\nand the least at LANL-97A. Although this behavior is\nconsistent with an injection of energetic particles on the\nnightside, we must point out that both the electron and\nproton flux enhancements during this event were somewhat\ncomplicated and difficult to interpret. From the 1989-046\nelectron data, there is evidence that injection activity may\nhave preceded the 2302:25 UT time and the LANL-97A and\n1994-084 electron fluxes clearly show numerous fluctua-\ntions prior to the onset. In addition, the proton P2 channel at\nLANL-97A (top orange trace in Figure 2d) appears to show\nan apparently anomalous increase following the onset time.\nAs we noted earlier, this is an artifact caused by electron\ncontamination due to an increase in the electron fluxes at\nLANL-97A.\n[21] Unfortunately, there was no global auroral imager\ndata available from either Polar or IMAGE during this time\nperiod, so we cannot confirm that an auroral onset was also\npresent, but from the data we do have, the event appears to\nbe a substorm which was associated with an injection of\nenergetic particles. From dispersion analysis, the western\nedge of the proton injection region could have been located\nas far west as 14\u201316 MLT.\n2.1.2. The 0041:29 and 0151:16 UT, 11 August Events\n[22] The second and third teeth are shown together in the\nsame plot in Figure 3. During these teeth, the GOES\nspacecraft were moving into the nightside. All three ob-\nserved dipolarizations with GOES 8 seeing it first. The\ndipolarization signature is delayed at GOES 11 and GOES\n10 which are each farther to the west. The times for both\nevents were derived from sharp increases in the GOES\n8 dipolarization signatures.\n[23] As can be seen from Figure 3c, the proton flux\nincreases are dispersed with the least dispersion seen at\n1989-046 and with the dispersion increasing as we move\nwest to the 1994-084 and LANL-97A locations. Note that\nwe have omitted the SOPA P2 channels from Figure 3c\nbecause they were contaminated near the onset times. As\nwith the previous tooth, the electron flux increases are\nsomewhat more complex than the proton flux increases\nand there are indications that some injection activity oc-\ncurred before and after each of the nominal times marked by\nthe vertical dashed lines. The electron signatures for the\n0151 UT event show a dispersionless increase near dawn\nwith progressively more dispersed signatures as you go east\nand this is consistent with a nightside substorm-associated\ninjection event.\n[24] No useful auroral images were available for the\n0041 UT event, but Polar\/VIS imagery was available for\nthe 0151 UT event. Although the viewing geometry was\nquite poor, the images nevertheless show a substorm-like\nintensification progressing eastward from the premidnight\nsector. Note also, that the dawnside aurora does not activate\nsimultaneously.\n[25] Although the data available for these two events are\nless than perfect, it appears that they are consistent with\nbeing substorms.\n2.1.3. The 0413:28 UT, 11 August Event\n[26] By 0413:28 UT, all three of the GOES spacecraft\nwere situated in the premidnight sector and they all saw\nvery clear dipolarization signatures. The time of 0413:28 UT\nadopted for the onset of the event was obtained from sharp\nincreases in the field tilt angle at GOES 8 and GOES 10.\nThe dipolarizations for this event do not show any signif-\nicant time delay between the three GOES spacecraft. At\n0413:28 UT, the LANL\/1989-046 spacecraft was situated a\nfew hours to the west of GOES 10 on the dayside close to\nthe dusk terminator. The energetic proton flux increases at\n1989-046 is nearly dispersionless at the onset time\n(Figure 4c), but the energetic electron flux enhancements\nat 1989-046 are quite delayed relative to the onset time\n(Figure 4b). In addition, the proton arrival times become\nprogressively more dispersed the farther west they are\nmeasured; that is, the proton flux enhancement is more\ndispersed at LANL-97A than it is at 1994-084. Note also,\nthat this dispersive behavior is exactly reversed for the\nelectrons; the least dispersed increase occurred at LANL-\n97A, and the dispersion progressively increases the farther\neast they are measured. This type of behavior is exactly\nwhat is expected from a substorm-associated nightside\/\nduskside injection of energetic particles. In addition to these\ndispersed injection signatures, we note that numerous dis-\npersionless flux variations were also observed throughout\nthis event and were again likely due to external solar wind\npressure variations.\n[27] In addition to the excellent positioning of the three\nGOES spacecraft for this event, IMAGE\/FUV also acquired\nexcellent high-resolution images during the onset. A\nsequence of 15 images from the FUV\/WIC instrument are\nshown in Figure 4a. The yellow box around the 0415:09 UT\nframe marks the first postonset image acquired by the WIC\nimager. The colored dots drawn on this image indicate the\nmagnetic local times of the LANL and GOES spacecraft at\n0415 UT (see Figure 4c for color-coding key and also note\nthat the latitude of each dot is arbitrary here and should not\nbe interpreted as the location of the magnetic footprint).\nNote that the image at 0415:09 UT, clearly shows the onset\nof an auroral substorm on the lower branch of a preexisting\n\u2018\u2018double-oval\u2019\u2019 configuration. The auroral activity associated\nwith this \u2018\u2018embedded auroral substorm\u2019\u2019 is initially localized\nto the premidnight sector and subsequently expands pole-\nward, westward and eastward. Such behavior is highly\nconsistent with the Akasofu picture of an auroral substorm\nonset occurring in the equatorward portion of the discrete\nauroral emission region [Akasofu, 1964]. Furthermore, we\nnote that while the onset is localized to the premidnight\nsector, there is also no obvious indication from the auroral\nmeasurements that any drastic dayside activations occurred\nimmediately prior to the onset as has been suggested by\nothers [Lyons et al., 2005].\n[28] We note that this tooth was also recently examined in\nsome detail by Lyons et al. [2005] and Lee et al. [2005]. Lee\net al. [2005] concluded that it was a \u2018\u2018pressure driven\u2019\u2019 tooth\nthat had a two-mode response consisting of a direct pressure\nA06206 HENDERSON ET AL.: 10\u201311 AUGUST 2000 SAWTOOTH EVENT\n6 of 32\nA06206\nresponse combined with a substorm-like particle injection.\nLyons et al. [2005] presented IMAGE\/WIC data and con-\ncluded that the auroral emissions also displayed this two-\nmode type of response. However, from the auroral data\npresented in this section, we do not see a clear dayside\nauroral intensification just prior to the nightside onset as one\nmight expect. Although the high-latitude feature near the\ndusk meridian and the lower-latitude emissions near dawn\nappear to intensify significantly following onset, we find\nthat the high-latitude duskside form brightened at least\n30 min prior to the tooth onset and was variable in both\nintensity and structure for entire period of time leading up to\nthe tooth onset. This finding is in direct contradiction with\nthe assertion by Lyons et al. [2005] that the feature\nbrightened only in concert with the tooth onset and casts\nconsiderable doubt on the validity of the argument that its\nbrightening is a visible indicator that the tooth behavior was\nto a great extent driven by a global pressure response. In\naddition, it is clear that by far the dominant auroral response\nduring this tooth was a substorm-like onset and expansion\nstarting in the premidnight sector. We will also explore this\nFigure 3. (a) Polar\/VIS images illustrating the behavior of the auroral distribution around the time of\nthe 0151 UT onset. (b and c) LANL geosynchronous energetic electron and proton data together with\nGOES 8, GOES 11, and GOES 10 field tilt angles for a 3 hour time period surrounding the 0151 UT\nonset.

[2005] attribute\nthe near-dispersionless proton flux increase at 1989-046\ntogether with the field dipolarizations at GOES 8 and GOES\n10 as a \u2018\u2018direct compression effect.\u2019\u2019 Specifically, they state\n(paragraph 28) \u2018\u2018that this proton flux enhancement at\n17.3 MLT initiates nearly simultaneously with the initiation\nof the dipolarizations observed at 23.3 and 19.3 MLTs . . .\nimplies that this is the global direct response to the pressure\npulse impact.\u2019\u2019 Although we also find that there were\nsignificant (likely pressure related) dispersionless flux var-\niations present in the LANL data during this tooth, we do\nnot concur with Lee et al. [2005] that the existence of near-\nsimultaneous dipolarizations at the GOES spacecraft and the\nnear-dispersionless proton flux increase at 1989-046 neces-\nsarily imply that they were due to a direct pressure response.\nIn our analysis of this event, we can see that not only is the\ndata consistent with a broad injection region in the duskside\/\nnightside, it is not consistent with a tailward propagating\ndisturbance. From the field inclination angle inferred from\nthe plasma data at 1994-084 and LANL-97A (data pre-\nFigure 4.

However, there was a small increase in the\nangle substantially before onset, and it is possible that this\nwas pressure induced. As well, the added data from the\nGOES 11 spacecraft indicates that the structure of\nthe dipolarization on the nightside was not even locally\nthe same.\n2.1.4. The 0639:06 UT, 11 August Event\n[30] For this tooth the three GOES spacecraft had\nmoved farther to the east but were still very well situated\nin the premidnight to postmidnight sectors. All of the\nGOES spacecraft saw dipolarizations with only a small\ntime delay between them. The dipolarization was seen first\nat GOES 11 at 0639 UT, and then about a minute or so\nlater at GOES 10 (to the west) and GOES 8 (to the east).\nBy 0639 UT, 1989-046 had also moved into the dusk-to-\nmidnight sector and was situated at 19.53 MLT. As shown\nin Figure 5c, the proton flux increases at 1989-046 were\nsharp and only slightly dispersed. Furthermore, as with\nthe previous tooth, the LANL satellites farther to the\nwest show progressively more dispersed proton flux\nFigure 5.

Meanwhile, the electron dispersion character-\nistics are exactly reversed, with the least dispersion seen at\nLANL-97A and the most seen at 1989-046 (see Figure 5b).\nAs with the previous tooth, the observed electron and\nproton dispersion patterns are highly consistent with a\nclassic nightside substorm-associated injection. The small\namount of proton dispersion observed at 1989-046 indi-\ncates that it was very close to, but outside (westward) of\nthe injection region during this event.\n[31] Excellent IMAGE\/FUV global auroral images are\nalso available for this event and are shown in Figure 5a. As\ncan be seen, a localized premidnight sector embedded\nsubstorm onset is clearly observed in the first postonset\nimage acquired at 0640:14 UT (highlighted with a yellow\nframe). The postonset expansion phase activity during this\ntooth is also highly consistent with the Akasofu description\nof auroral substorm activity. In addition, we do not see any\nsystematic onset-associated, simultaneously global activa-\ntions of the aurora in Figure 5a.\n[32] From the data presented here, it is clear that this\nevent was a substorm, and we note that Lyons et al. [2005]\narrived at the same conclusion.\nFigure 6. (a) IMAGE\/FUV WIC images illustrating the behavior of the auroral distribution around the\ntime of the 0818:06 UT onset.

The 0818:06 UT, 11 August Event\n[33] For this tooth, GOES 10 was situated in the premid-\nnight sector at 23.13 MLT, while GOES 11 and GOES\n8 were situated in the postmidnight sector at 1.13 MLT and\n3.12 MLT respectively. GOES 10 and GOES 11 both saw\nfield dipolarizations, but GOES 10 was the only one that\nsaw a very dramatic sharp dipolarization. The 0818:06 UT\ntime adopted for this event was derived from the GOES 10\ndipolarization. GOES 8, which was the easternmost of\nthe GOES spacecraft did see a systematic postonset increase\nin the field inclination angle, but it was fairly gradual\nin comparison to what was observed at GOES 10 and\nGOES 11. At 0818:06 UT, 1989-046 was very well situated\nin the premidnight sector and as shown in Figures 6b and\n6c, it observed abrupt dispersionless proton and electron\nflux increases in conjunction with the GOES 10 dipolariza-\ntion. Proton dispersion increases toward the west while\nelectron dispersion increases toward the east, which is,\nagain, consistent with a nightside substorm injection.\n[34] The IMAGE\/FUV WIC data for this event\n(Figure 6a) also shows an embedded auroral onset associ-\nated with the dipolarization. Furthermore, although still\nFigure 7. (a) IMAGE\/FUV WIC images illustrating the behavior of the auroral distribution around the\ntime of the 1030:01 UT onset.

The initial\nonset region expands poleward, eastward and westward and\nis consistent with an Akasofu-type auroral substorm. We\nalso note that aside from the substorm disturbance, there\nwas no other global auroral activation associated with the\ntooth onset.\n[35] From the data presented here, this tooth also appears\nto be a substorm, and we note that this is also in agreement\nwith the findings of Lyons et al. [2005].\n2.1.6. The 1030:01 UT, 11 August Event\n[36] During this tooth, the three GOES spacecraft were all\nsituated in the midnight-to-dawn sector. Of these spacecraft,\nGOES 10 (which is the westernmost of the trio), was the\nonly one that observed a dramatic dipolarization signature.\nOn the other hand, the LANL 1989-046 spacecraft was well\nsituated in the premidnight sector and observed dispersion-\nless flux increases in both electrons (Figure 7b) and protons\n(Figure 7c). Again, as with the previous teeth, the dispersion\nsignatures are consistent with a nightside injection source. It\nis interesting to note, however, that the dipolarization\nsignature observed at GOES 10 was significantly delayed\nrelative to the particle enhancements at 1989-046. The time\nadopted for the onset of this tooth was obtained from 1 s\nresolution Pi2-filtered ground magnetic H component data\nfrom Bikia (BIK).\n[37] IMAGE\/FUV WIC global auroral images are also\navailable for this tooth and are shown in Figure 7a. The first\npostonset image was acquired at 1031:12 UT and is marked\nwith a yellow box. As can be seen, the onset was localized\nnear the 21\u201322 MLT sector and subsequently expanded\npoleward, eastward and westward as is typical for auroral\nsubstorm expansion phase activity. We note that, as with the\nother teeth examined thus far, no global activations were\nseen at onset. Furthermore, the envelope of auroral activity\nin the substorm bulge region appears to take over 10 min to\npropagate into the postmidnight sector where the GOES 10\nspacecraft was situated, and this may very well explain the\nrelatively long time delay between the dispersionless\ninjection at 1989-046 and the dipolarization signature at\nGOES 10. On the basis of the IMAGE\/FUV data together\nwith the LANL and GOES geosynchronous observations,\nthis tooth also appears to be a substorm.\n2.1.7. The 1330:58 UT, 11 August Event\n[38] By the time this event occurred, the three GOES\nspacecraft had moved into the dawn sector and were not\nwell situated to observe nightside field dipolarizations. At\n1331 UT, GOES 10 was the only one of the three remaining\non the nightside at 4.27 MLT. Neither GOES 11 nor GOES\n8 observed any evidence of a dipolarization associated this\nevent, but a small increase in the field inclination angle was\nobserved at GOES 10 near 1333 UT (in passing, it is\ninteresting to note how sharp this increase looks in the 30\nhour plot shown in Figure 1). By 1331 UT, the LANL 1989-\n046 spacecraft had also moved into the postmidnight sector\nand LANL-97A and 1994-084 had entered into the dusk-to-\nmidnight sector.\n[39] The time adopted for the start of this event was\n1330:58 UT and was determined from the 1 s resolution\nPi2-filtered ground magnetometer H component trace\nfrom MacQuarie Island (MCQ) shown in Figure 8b. At\n1330:58 UT, MacQuarie Island was located just past the\nmidnight meridian as shown in the last panel of Figure 8a.\n[40] At 1989-046, small dispersionless electron and pro-\nton flux increases were observed in conjunction with the\nfield dipolarization at GOES 10. Also, at 1994-084, which\nwas situated to the west of 1989-046, a slightly dispersed\nproton flux enhancement was observed while the electron\nfluxes displayed a dropout-like (probably lobe entry) be-\nhavior which was punctuated by a sudden pulse-like partial\nrecovery followed by a step-like recovery. In addition,\nalthough LANL-97A had numerous data gaps after\n1330 UT, the data that is available from that spacecraft\nshows that there was a very gradual nearly dispersionless\nincrease in both the electron and proton fluxes associated\nwith this event, although it was delayed relative to the more\nabrupt increase seen at 1989-046.\n[41] Because of the poor locations of the GOES space-\ncraft, and the complexity of the LANL data, we cannot say\nwith certainty from these data sets alone whether the\n1330:58 UT event was associated with a substorm-like\ninjection on the nightside. However, a secondary burst\nof Pi2 pulsations was observed at MacQuarie Island at\n1410:20 UT as shown in Figure 8b. This Pi2 pulse appears\nto be associated with a dispersed electron population seen at\n1989-046 (located to the east) and a dispersed proton\npopulation seen at 1994-084 (located to the west) and does\nappear to be consistent with a nightside injection of par-\nticles. In addition, from the 30 hour plot shown in Figure 1,\nit is clear that electron fluxes at LANL-97A and 1994-084\nbegan increasing near \u000114 UT, much later than the increase\nseen at 1989-046. Thus it appears that a true injection did\noccur during this tooth.\n[42] No IMAGE\/FUV data was available during this\nevent. Polar\/VIS global auroral images of the southern polar\ncap are available and are shown in Figure 8a, but unfortu-\nnately, the last frame available was acquired several minutes\nbefore the 1330:58 UT onset time. We are therefore unable\nto determine whether an auroral onset was observed in\nassociation with either of the Pi2 bursts. The frames that are\navailable show that the Southern Hemisphere auroral dis-\ntribution displayed a prominent double-oval type configu-\nration, which, as we have seen for the previous teeth, is a\ntypical preonset configuration during sawtooth events.\n2.1.8. The 1845:36 UT, 11 August Event\n[43] At 1845 UT, the three GOES spacecraft were posi-\ntioned symmetrically around the the noon meridian with\nGOES 11 at 11.83 MLT and GOES 10 and GOES 8 situated\nprenoon and postnoon at 9.77 MLT and 13.75 MLT respec-\ntively. 1989-046 was in the dawn to noon sector (at\n7.80 MLT) and LANL-97A and 1994-084 were situated\npremidnight and postmidnight respectively (at 23.46 MLT\nand 1.62 MLT). A small dipolarization is observed at GOES\n11 and GOES 8, but no clear dipolarization signature was\nobserved at GOES 10 (data shown later in section 2.4).\nNevertheless, as shown in Figures 9b and 9c, all three\nGOES spacecraft observed an abrupt and simultaneous\nincrease in the B field magnitude. In addition, the proton\nflux increases observed at the three LANL spacecraft\nwere globally dispersionless and virtually simultaneous\n(Figure 9c). This is also true for the electron flux increases,\nalthough we note that the electron fluxes increased by only\na small amount (Figure 9b). The ground magnetometer data\nA06206 HENDERSON ET AL.: 10\u201311 AUGUST 2000 SAWTOOTH EVENT\n12 of 32\nA06206\nalso showed a global near-simultaneous abrupt increase and\nwe adopted a time of 1845:36 UT based on 1s H component\ndata from the SAMNET\/YORK station.\n[44] From Figures 9b and 9c, we can also see that there\nwas no clear evidence of any drifting energetic electron or\nproton populations at geosynchronous orbit following the\nabrupt field increase. Thus, unlike the previous events, this\none did not appear to be associated with a localized\ninjection of energetic particles anywhere at geosynchronous\norbit. Instead, the dispersionless flux enhancements were\nproduced as a result of the spacecraft sampling different\nparticle populations due to a rapid, global field reconfigu-\nration. Furthermore, this is exactly what one would expect if\nthe field increase were due to the arrival of an IMF\/SW\nshock.\n[45] Fortunately, IMAGE\/FUV images were available\nduring this event and are shown in Figure 9a. The first\npostflux increase image was taken at 1846:20 UT (marked\nwith a yellow frame) and clearly shows an intensification of\nthe high-latitude aurora in the postnoon sector. Interestingly,\nFigure 8. (a) Polar\/VIS Southern Hemisphere images illustrating the behavior of the auroral distribution\nprior to the 1330:58 UT onset.

In fact, we would not have originally consid-\nered this event to be a tooth due to the lack of substantial\nelectron flux enhancements and its obvious shock-associated\nappearance.\n2.2. Synopsis of Auroral Behavior and IMAGE\/FUV\nKeograms\n[47] In Figures 4\u20137 we presented sequences of IMAGE\/\nFUV WIC images illustrating the behavior of the northern\nauroral distribution before, during and after the onset of the\n0413, 0639, 0818, and 1031 UT teeth. In each case, the\nonset of the tooth was associated with a localized brighten-\ning of the auroral distribution in the dusk to midnight sector\non the lower branch of a \u2018\u2018double-oval\u2019\u2019 configuration. A\ndouble-oval configuration is one in which a broadly ex-\ntended (in azimuth) region of auroral emissions resides\npoleward of the main auroral oval. Such double-oval con-\nfigurations are known to develop out of the recovery phase\nof some substorms and are also characteristic of steady\nmagnetospheric convection (SMC) intervals.\n[48] In each case, a double-oval configuration is observed\nduring the time period leading up to onset, although in some\ncases the poleward portion is somewhat faint and hard to see\nin the individual images. The double-oval progressively\nthins until a localized onset occurs on the equatormost\nportion in the dusk to midnight sector. Then the initially\nlocalized brightening expands poleward, eastward and west-\nward in a manner quite consistent with the Akasofu picture\nof auroral substorm development. This behavior was also\nfound to occur in the 18 April 2002 sawtooth event\nFigure 10. Keograms generated from a series IMAGE\/FUV WIC images showing the latitudinal\nmotion of the aurora. (a) An example showing how keograms are created. The auroral intensities along a\ngiven meridian is extracted from each image and stacked next to one another to create a latitude-versus-\ntime plot.

Shown are keograms constructed from the raw\nIMAGE\/FUV WIC images at 17 different magnetic local\ntimes. For each panel, slices of the auroral intensity along\nthe given MLT meridian are stacked next to one another in\norder to create latitude versus time plots. Figure 10a\nillustrates this process for the 22 MLT keogram. The\nbehavior described above is clearly illustrated in this format.\nSpecifically each onset occurs on the lower branch of a\nthinned down double-oval configuration. The envelope of\nauroral activity expands poleward and then develops into a\nnew double-oval configuration which then thins down again\nprior to the next onset. By comparing keograms at different\nMLTs, it is also very clear that the auroral activity does not\nexpand poleward simultaneously at all local times. The\nkeograms in the premidnight sector show a prompt response\nat the onset times, but as we move to earlier and later local\ntime sectors, a substantial delay can be seen between the\ntime of onset and the local auroral response. This behavior\nis typical for storm-time substorms for which the onsets are\n\u2018\u2018embedded\u2019\u2019 in a preexisting double-oval configuration\n[e.g., Henderson et al., 2006].\n[50] Although we have clearly demonstrated that the\nexplosive auroral disturbances associated with each tooth\nare not simultaneously global phenomena, we note that\nFigure 11. Energy versus time flux perturbation maps constructed by merging together data from three\nseparate instruments on the LANL geosynchronous spacecraft (MPA, SOPA, and ESP). The protons are\nshown with an inverted energy scale.\nA06206 HENDERSON ET AL.: 10\u201311 AUGUST 2000 SAWTOOTH EVENT\n16 of 32\nA06206\nother types of auroral disturbances can also be seen in the\nauroral images shown in Figures 4\u20137. Perhaps the most\nprominent of these are the intense eastward propagating\nomega bands which can be seen in the (approximately)\nmidnight to dawn sectors throughout the sawtooth event.\nThese types of auroral forms have long been associated with\nthe substorm recovery phase [Akasofu, 1977; Opgenoorth et\nal., 1994], but as discussed by Henderson et al. [2002,\n2006], they are also very commonly observed during steady\nmagnetospheric convection (SMC) events. In addition, as\nshown by Henderson et al. [2002], equatorward moving\nauroral streamers generated at the poleward portions of the\ndouble-oval (i.e., \u2018\u2018poleward boundary intensifications\u2019\u2019 or\nPBIs) can evolve into torch-like structures and omega bands\nduring active times. As pointed out by Henderson et al.\n[2006], omega bands in general tend to be associated with\nthe dynamics of the double-oval configuration whether such\na configuration is produced as a remnant of a prior substorm\nonset (i.e., a recovery phase feature) or is a more long-lived\nconfiguration typical of SMC events. We note that all of this\ntype of behavior is observed in the 10\u201311 August 2000\nsawtooth event. As well, due to the cyclical nature of\nsawtooth events, many of these features can be seen to\noverlap temporally and spatially. For example, while the\nfirst 7 frames in Figure 4 show omega bands in the midnight\nto dawn sector, the 8th frame shows the development of the\nlocalized premidnight equatorward onset in addition to the\npreexisting omega band forms found farther to the east.\nAlthough the omega band forms can be thought of as\n\u2018\u2018recovery phase\u2019\u2019 features associated with the previous\nsubstorm, during sawtooth events they also appear to be\nprominent preonset features for subsequent teeth. In this\nregard, omega bands and the underlying magnetospheric\nconditions associated with them may represent important\npreconditioners for subsequent onsets and may even act as a\ncatalyst in terms of destabilizing the inner magnetosphere to\ncertain types of instabilities (e.g., ballooning).\n2.3. Geosynchronous Dispersion Signatures\n[51] In section 2.1, we presented expanded plots of the\ngeosynchronous energetic electron and proton fluxes from\nthe LANL SOPA instruments for each of the teeth. These\nplots clearly demonstrate that all but the 1845:36 UT (and\nperhaps the 1330:58 UT) teeth were associated with disper-\nsion signatures consistent with a nightside injection source.\nIn this section, we show that this interpretation holds over\nthe entire energy range measured by the 3 separate LANL\ninstruments (MPA, SOPA, and ESP).\n[52] In Figure 11, we present energy versus time spectro-\ngrams for each of the LANL spacecraft. Data from all three\nLANL instruments (MPA, SOPA, ESP) are shown together\nin the so-called \u2018\u2018McIlwain format\u2019\u2019 in which the electron\nenergies increase up the page while the proton energies\nincrease down the page. Note that for both species,\nthe energies range from a few eV up to several MeV. The\nrationale for inverting the proton energy axes is that the\nlowest energy particles of either species follow the same\ndrift trajectories. Thus placing the \u0001 \u2018\u2018zero\u2019\u2019 energy par-\nticles adjacent to one another allows one to more easily see\ncorrelations that may exist between the species at very low\nenergies.\n[53] Some caveats concerning the data shown in Figure 11\nare important to note. First, the color levels do not represent\ndifferential flux. Instead, they represent deviations of the\ndifferential flux from an average (energy-dependent) back-\nground level. The background levels for each energy\nchannel are computed as a robust average of the log of\nthe flux. The data is presented in this manner in order to\nenhance energy-time dispersion signatures and the units\nassociated with the color scale are therefore considered to\nbe arbitrary. Second, we have retained the SOPA P1, P2 and\nP6 energy channels in the energy versus time spectrograms.\nWe have done this for two reasons: (1) at times, the P1 and\n(particularly) P2 channels show some useful data; (2) the\ncontamination problems associated with these channels\nshow up very clearly in these flux perturbation maps. It is\ntherefore immediately obvious when the P1 and P2 channels\nshould be trusted or not (P6 should never be trusted). For\nexample, strong contamination in the LANL-97A and 1994-\n084 SOPA P1, P2 and P6 channels is very noticeable as the\nanomalous horizontal lines in the early part of the day.\n[54] From Figure 11a, we can clearly see that numerous\nenergy-time dispersed signatures are evident in both the\nelectron and proton fluxes. These appear as bands of\nenhanced fluxes that are seen first at high energies and at\nprogressively more delayed times for lower energies. At still\nlower energies we can also see transitions from the plasma-\nsphere to fresh plasma sheet populations. For example, at\n1994-084, the plasmasphere can be identified as the <50 eV\nintense (white) proton band extending from about 0400 to\n0830 UT. After 1045 UT, 1994-084 entered the region of\nthe tail where fresh plasma sheet particles have access\nto. Between 0830 and 1045 UT, weak enhancements\nin the plasma sheet energy electron fluxes were also\nobserved. This same sequence of features can be seen in\nthe LANL-97A spectrograms as well, except delayed by a\nfew hours because LANL-97A trails 1994-084 by a few\nhours in orbital phase.\n[55] As an interpretive aid, we have schematically high-\nlighted some of the relevant dispersion features in Figure\n11b. The onset time associated with each tooth is shown as a\ndash-dotted vertical line while the dispersion features are\ndrawn as solid or dashed lines. (Dashed lines are used to\nindicate faint or difficult to follow dispersion traces.) For\nclarity, we have also used different colors to group features\nassociated with a given tooth.\n[56] From Figure 11b we can see that the dispersion\npatterns are systematically organized. For example, if we\nfocus on the LANL-97A and 1994-084 protons, we can see\nthat the dispersion traces associated with each of the 0041-\n1030 UT teeth become less and less dispersed as the\nspacecraft gets closer and closer to the nightside. By the\ntime of the 1030:01 UT onset, the 1994-084 spacecraft was\nclose to the fresh electron plasma sheet access region and\nsaw only a weakly to moderately dispersed pattern. Note\nthat this organization also exists between the spacecraft. For\nexample, for the 0818:06 UT event (yellow lines in\nFigure 11b), 1989-046 was close to the onset meridian\n(see Figure 6a) and it saw a dispersionless injection in\nboth protons and electrons. Meanwhile, LANL-97A and\n1994-084, which were in the postnoon sector, saw dispersed\npatterns with more dispersion in the protons at LANL-97A\nthan at 1994-084 and vice versa for the electrons. These\nA06206 HENDERSON ET AL.: 10\u201311 AUGUST 2000 SAWTOOTH EVENT\n17 of 32\nA06206\ntypes of dispersion patterns are very similar to those\npredicted by Mauk and Meng [1983] based on the classical\ninjection boundary model and are fully consistent with an\ninjection of particles on the nightside.\n[57] Note that the 1845:36 UT event shows no obvious\nsubstorm-like electron dispersion, but there is evidence of\ndispersive features in the SOPA protons. The 1330:58 UT\nevent also does not show clear dispersion, but there does\nappear to be substorm-like dispersion features following\nsoon after 14 UT.\n[58] In addition to substorm-like dispersion patterns, in\nthe LANL geosynchronous data, numerous dispersionless\nfeatures can occur that are not related to substorms or\ninjections. For example, shocks often produce very easy\nto recognize global, near-simultaneous dispersionless flux\nvariations at geosynchronous orbit (the 1845 UT event is a\nrather typical example of this). These have been routinely\nobserved in our data for many years (e.g., see the recent\npaper by Huang et al. [2005]). In addition, sustained\ncontinuous dispersionless variations are often seen during\ndisturbed conditions (e.g., storm-time conditions). One of\nthe best ways we have found to display these dispersionless\nflux variations is in the type of flux perturbation spectro-\ngrams shown in Figure 11. From the electrons in the 1989-\n046 panel, we note that such dispersionless flux variations\nwere occurring continuously for (at least) the first 1\/3 of the\nday (of 11 August). These are easily seen as the vertical\nstripes in the spectrogram. An expanded version of this is\npresented in Figure 12.\n[59] As can be seen, there are many dispersionless flux\nvariations during this whole time period as indicated by the\narrows. (There are in fact more of them and they have more\nstructure than the arrows would indicate). The top shows\nline plots of the flux perturbations (in arbitrary units) and\nthe bottom panel is a reproduction of the Weimer-propagated\nACE solar wind pressure variations (discussed in\nsection 2.6). While no one would expect a perfect match\nhere, we shall see later that it is likely that this pressure\nprofile is a reasonable representation of what actually\nimpinged upon the magnetosphere. Indeed, although the\ncorrespondence is far from perfect, we see that some of\nthe pulses in the solar wind match fairly well with some of\nthe dispersionless flux variations seen in the LANL data.\nWhat is even more interesting though, is that the major\npulses near the 0413:28 UT tooth begin quite substantially\nbefore the tooth onset.\n[60] An expanded view of this between 0330 and 0600\nUT is shown in Figure 13. Here the top set of three curves\nare the 1989-046 proton flux perturbations (i.e., line plot\nversions of the data shown in Figure 11) and the next set of\nseven curves are the 1989-046 electron flux perturbations.\nThe middle three curves are the magnetic field inclination\nangle at GOES 8 (purple), GOES 11 (blue), and GOES 10\n(green) and the bottom curve is the Weimer-propagated\nACE solar wind dynamic pressure (see section 2.6). From\nthis plot, we note a number of features. (1) The dipolariza-\ntion at the three GOES spacecraft are not coherent. There is\nsubstantial delay apparent and the structure of the dipolari-\nzations is different at each spacecraft. (2) The two disper-\nsionless spikes visible in the electron fluxes after onset\ncould very well be due to externally imposed solar wind\npressure variations. However, it is difficult to temporally\nmatch these features with similar features in either the\nFigure 12. Perturbation electron fluxes at 1989-046\ntogether with Weimer-propagated ACE solar wind dynamic\npressure. Note that short-lived (likely pressure induced)\ndispersionless flux perturbations were occurring nearly\ncontinuously for the first 8 hours of the day (arrows).\nThese can be seen most clearly as the vertical stripes in the\ncolor energy versus time perturbation spectrogram.\nFigure 13. Perturbation electron and proton fluxes\nmeasured at 1989-046 together with GOES 10, GEOS 11,\nand GOES 8 field inclination angles and Weimer-\npropagated ACE solar wind pressure. The arrows indicate\ndispersionless features in the electron fluxes that are likely\ndue to local field fluctuations that were likely induced by\nexternal pressure variations. Note that the pressure pulses\noccur substantially before tooth onset and are not well\ncorrelated with the GOES dipolarization behavior.\nA06206 HENDERSON ET AL.: 10\u201311 AUGUST 2000 SAWTOOTH EVENT\n18 of 32\nA06206\nprotons or the GOES inclination angles. (3) The injection-\nassociated dispersion features begin at onset time which is\nearlier than the two prominent dispersionless spikes. (4) The\nlargest solar wind pressure pulse appears to hit the magne-\ntosphere quite substantially before the tooth onset.\n[61] In contrast with these findings, in their analysis of\nthis tooth, Lee et al. [2005] matched the largest pressure\npulse (near 4UT), with the proton flux increase at 1989-046\nand the dipolarizations at the GOES spacecraft. However,\nwe note that they did not propagate the solar wind data at\nall. Instead they appear to have just assumed that the largest\npressure pulse should match the start of the tooth. We do not\nfind this to be the case when a reasonable (and tested) SW\/\nIMF propagation is used. It appears that the subjective\nmapping assumed by Lee et al. [2005] is off by a pulse.\nIn addition, we note that in a related paper, Lyons et al.\n[2005] have a different mapping between the pressure\npulses and their putative effects on the magnetospheric\nbehavior. Their mapping is closer to what we present here.\nOn the basis of our more objective solar wind propagation\nresults, we conclude that the largest pressure pulse arrived\nprior to the tooth onset and therefore likely was not a direct\ndriver for the increases seen at 1989-046 and the three\nGOES spacecraft at 0413:28 UT. This is also consistent\nwith our finding that the high-latitude duskside auroral\nfeature brightened quite substantially prior to the tooth\nonset. In our view, a more plausible interpretation is that\nthe pressure pulse (and\/or concomitant IMF variations)\ntriggered the substorm and that most of the dispersionless\nflux variations visible during this and other teeth represent\nshort-lived pressure-induced perturbations to the underlying\ninjection-associated behavior.\n2.4. Geosynchronous Dipolarization Signatures\n[62] Although the LANL spacecraft do not carry mag-\nnetometers, the field direction can be inferred from the\nFigure 14.

For the MPA-derived angles, only points are\nplotted due to the fairly large scatter present and only\nvalues for which the Tk\/T? ratio was less than 0.95 or\ngreater than 1.05 are shown since values of the temperature\nanisotropy that are closer to 1.0 typically yield unreliable\nfield directions.\n[63] In Figure 14a, the time periods during which each\nspacecraft was situated on the nightside are shaded gray and\nthe onset times associated with each tooth are drawn as\nvertical dashed lines. An interesting feature that is immedi-\nately apparent from this plot is that the tooth-associated\nstrong stretching and dipolarization signatures (i.e., sudden\nlarge increases in q) are typically confined to the nightside.\nFor example, the first significant dipolarization signature\nseen at 1989-046 was associated with the 0639:06 UT event\nand that was the first tooth for which the 1989-046\nspacecraft was situated on the nightside (see Figure 14c\nfor spacecraft locations at 0640 UT). Meanwhile, the GOES\nFigure 15. (a) GOES 8 field inclination angle for a 5 day period between 9 August (top panel) and\n13 August (bottom panel).

Note that the LANL-97A\nand 1994-084 spacecraft appear to show some significant\nfluctuations in the field inclination angle when they were in\nthe noon-to-dusk sector, but they were relatively small and\nthere is some indication that they were also significantly\ndelayed relative to the nightside signatures observed at the\nother spacecraft.\n[64] The field inclination angle during the 1845:36 UT\nevent is shown in more detail in Figure 14b. In addition to\nthe six spacecraft shown in Figure 14a, we have added the\nPolar spacecraft which was situated in the postmidnight\nsector at 1846 UT (see Figure 14d for spacecraft locations).\nAs can be seen, on the dayside the field inclination angle\nincreases slightly at GOES 11 and GOES 8, and but not at\nGOES 10 and a small decrease was observed at 1989-046.\nOn the nightside, 1994-084 does not show any apparent\ndipolarization, but LANL-97A and Polar do. Except for at\nLANL-97A, the dipolarizations are all quite small relative\nto the earlier teeth. At LANL-97A, the increase in q is\ncomparable to some of the other teeth, but the field is not\ninitially as stretched. In addition, unlike the other teeth, the\nincrease appears to be a relatively transient phenomenon on\nthe leading edge of a more gradual relaxation of the\nstretched field at LANL-97A. This behavior can be seen\nmore clearly in Figure 14a.\n[65] Figure 15a shows the field inclination angle at GOES\n8 for a 5 day period from 9 to 13 August 2000. Each panel\nrepresents one day (with 9 August at the top and 13 August\nat the bottom). The field inclination angle is shown as a\nsolid red line and the background image in each panel is an\noccurrence frequency histogram of the GOES 8 field incli-\nnation angle observed over a 280 day period centered on\n11 August 2000. The region of highest occurrence frequency\nappears as a sinusoidal black band with a minimum on the\nnightside and a maximum on the dayside, i.e., the field is\nmore stretched on the nightside and more dipolar on the\ndayside as is well known. On the nightside there is also an\nenhanced occurrence frequency extending to much lower\nangles and this is due to stretching events like substorms.\nComparing the red traces with the histogram in each panel, it\nis clear that the tail stretching associated with this sawtooth\nevent was amongst the most extreme during the 280 day\nspan surrounding it. In addition, we note that on the 11th\nwhen GOES 8 is on the dayside (\u00011200\u20131800 UT) the\nhistogram shows that the field becomes much more stretched\nthan is typical. This indicates that sawtooth events can\nproduce very rare dayside stretching as well, although the\nfield lines do not become tail-like as they do on the\nnightside.\n[66] A more detailed view of the GOES 8 nightside\ndipolarizations on the 11th is shown in Figure 15b. In this\nplot, the dashed red line is the mean inclination angle\nassociated with the 280 day histogram. Note that for some\nof the dipolarization events, the field does not return to this\nnominal value indicating that for some of the teeth, the tail\ncan remain somewhat more stretched than usual even after\nthe dipolarization.\n[67] Figure 15c shows the GOES 8 field inclination angle\nbetween 0300 and 0500 UT on 11 August together with the\n486 nm Meridian Scanning Photometer (MSP) data from\nPinawa. Although the quality of the MSP data is substan-\ntially reduced because the moon is up and there is some\natmospheric haze, there is no doubt that the proton aurora\n(as monitored at 486 nm) is over Pinawa. This is noteworthy\nbecause the proton aurora is only very rarely seen at such\nlow latitudes. At 0413 UT, a brightening occurs which is\nassociated with a poleward retreat of the proton aurora. The\npoleward motion of the proton auroral boundary indicates a\ndipolarization of the tail field which is consistent with the\nGOES 8 measurements shown in the bottom panel of 15c.\n[68] Riometer data from Pinawa and other locations in the\nCanadian NORSTAR array are also shown in Figures 15c\nand 15d. It is interesting to note that although a prompt\nabsorption signal was observed at 0413 UT at Pinawa, the\nother stations did not observe a drop until at least 5 min\nlater. The absorption signal can then be seen expanding\npoleward and westward in typical substorm fashion. This\nclearly demonstrates that the absorption onset effects were\ninitially localized in latitude to Pinawa for at least 5 min.\nFurthermore, the Fort McMurray (MCM) station is only\nabout 4\u0001 (of CGM latitude) poleward and 23\u0001 west of\nFigure 16.

The blue and purple colors\nindicate that a station was in the dusk-midnight and mid-\nnight-dawn sectors respectively (i.e., on the nightside),\nwhile the green and orange colors indicate that it was in\nthe dawn-noon and noon-dusk sectors respectively (i.e., on\nthe dayside). From Figure 16 it is clear that many of the\nteeth were associated with obvious intense negative \u2018\u2018H\nbays\u2019\u2019 and that these H bays were typically most intense\nwhen they were observed on the nightside. In addition, they\nwere also not globally simultaneous, but rather they tended\nto develop in the premidnight sector first. We note also that\nthere was no obvious substorm-like signatures associated\nwith the 1845:36 UT event.\n[70] A similar plot of the 1 min resolution low- and\nmiddle-latitude H or X component ground magnetometer\ndata from 51 stations between magnetic latitudes of \u000250\u0001 to\n50\u0001 is presented in Figure 17. Here, we also see that the\nmost intense positive \u2018\u2018H bays\u2019\u2019 tend to occur on the\nnightside or are skewed toward the dusk-midnight sector.\nAt other locations, smaller negative or \u2018\u2018transitional H\nbays\u2019\u2019 (i.e., bays with both positive and negative excursions\n[Rostoker, 1966]) are observed. In addition, it is extremely\nclear from this plot that most of the teeth were not\nassociated with a globally simultaneous onset of positive\nH bays. For example, during the 0413:28 UT event, the\nstrongest and most prompt increases in H were observed in\nthe premidnight sector over the eastern half of the North and\nSouth American continents (e.g., at San Jaun (SJG), Fre-\ndricksburg (FRD) and Korou (KOU)). However, as one\nmoves away from this region the H bays decrease in\nstrength and are observed at progressively more delayed\ntimes. This type of behavior is completely consistent with\nsubstorm activity and we note that the strongest positive H\nbays for the 0413:28 UT event occurred in exactly the same\nsector as the auroral onset shown earlier in Figure 4.\n[71] In sharp contrast to the earlier events (including the\n0413:28 UT event), for the 1845:36 UT event, Figure 17\nclearly shows that a positive-going impulse was observed\nnearly simultaneously at all local times. This type of activity\nis not consistent with a substorm, but is consistent with the\narrival of a sudden solar wind pressure enhancement and as\nshown previously in Figure 9 the geosynchronous and\nauroral behavior is also fully consistent with this interpre-\ntation. For the 1330:58 UT event, the ground magnetometer\ndata shows some auroral zone negative H bay activity on\nthe nightside (see Figure 16) but the low- and middle-\nlatitude stations show only very weak positive H bays in the\nmidnight to postdawn sectors (see Figure 17) and it is again\nunclear exactly what happened during this event.\n[72] Although we have already presented the auroral\nelectrojet index in Figure 1, it is important to recognize\nthat this index is derived from only 12 auroral zone stations.\nAs is well known, this limited spatial coverage means that\nthe spatial and temporal behavior of the auroral electrojets is\nnot always well characterized by AU and AL. Furthermore,\nwhile the standard AU and AL indices are always defined\nby a single contributing station at any given time (with\ndifferent stations contributing to AU and AL), the magnetic\nlocal time of the contributing station is not specified. In\norder to increase the spatial coverage and in order to\ndetermine the MLT of the contributing stations for the\n11 August sawtooth event, we have constructed a 27-station\nversion of the standard AU and AL envelope indices\n(hereafter referred to as AU* and AL* to avoid confusion\nwith the real AU and AL indices). The results are shown in\nFigure 18. AU* and AL* are shown in the first two panels,\nwhile in the bottom panel we have plotted the magnetic\nlocal time of the station that contributed to each index. As\nwith the standard AL index, the AL* index in Figure 18\nshows prompt substorm-like negative excursions in associ-\nation with the 0151 UT to 1330 UT events. Less intense\npositive excursions in AU* are also observed. The behavior\nof AU* and AL* for the 0041 UT event is more complex and\nFigure 17.

This is consistent with AU being\nproduced mainly by the DP2-associated eastward electrojet.\nIn contrast, there is much more variability present in the\nMLT of the AL* contributing station. Specifically, a jump to\nearlier, premidnight locations is observed following each of\nthe onsets between 0151 UT and 1030 UT. Since during\ndisturbed conditions, the AL index is most often contributed\nto from stations located near 0300 MLT [Allen and Kroehl,\n1975; Akasofu et al., 1980], this type of behavior is\nindicative of the establishment of a new substorm-associated\nwestward electrojet in the premidnight sector in association\nwith each of these onsets (e.g., see Kamide [1988, chap. 3,\nand references therein] or the more recent study of Gjerloev\net al. [2004]). Thus the 0151 UT to 1030 UT events appear\nto have been associated with the development of a substorm\n(or DP1) current system on top of the preexisting DP2\ncurrent system. Note that the 0041, 1330 and 1845 UT\nevents do not show evidence of such a jump.\n[74] Another index that has been used in recent years to\ninfer variations in the DP2 current system is the Polar Cap\nor PC index [Troshichev et al., 1979, 1988]. This index is\nderived from the horizontal variations observed at a single\npolar cap magnetometer station. In the Northern Hemi-\nsphere, the Thule magnetometer station is used to derive\nthe PCN index (N for northern) while in the Southern\nHemisphere, the Antarctic Vostok station is used to derive\nthe PCS index (S for southern). In Figure 19 we present the\nThule horizontal components together with the PCN index.\nAs can be seen, a significant increase in the PCN index\noccurs at or following each of the 0151\u20131845 UT events.\nAlthough such increases have been used to indirectly infer\nthe occurrence of solar wind pressure pulse hits on the\nmagnetosphere [e.g., Lee et al., 2004] or IMF changes that\naffect the polar cap ionospheric electric field [Troshichev et\nal., 2000], we have already shown that, for the 0151 to\nFigure 18.

To avoid confusion with the standard AU and AL\nindices, we have labeled the curves AL* and AU*. The\nbottom panel shows the magnetic local time of the stations\ncontributing to AL* and AU*.\nFigure 19.

The fact that the\nincreases in PCN associated with those events all occur at\nor following the onsets indicates that they are likely to have\nbeen produced by a substorm-associated current system (or\na combination of DP1 and DP2 increases) rather than a\nlarge-scale response of only the DP2 system. Although this\ninterpretation is at odds with some studies that claim the PC\nindices do not respond appreciably to substorms [e.g., Liou\net al., 2003], it is consistent with the recent work of Huang\n[2005] and other studies that have shown a high correlation\nbetween increases in the PC index and substorm occurrence\n[e.g., Troshichev et al., 1979; Troshichev and Lukianova,\n2002]. We note also that the 1845 and 1330 UT events show\nan increase in PCN and these may well have been due to\npressure hits or IMF changes as we shall see in the next\nsection.\n[75] Next, we present high-resolution magnetometer data\nfrom the U.S. East Coast Measure Array. Figure 20 shows 1\ns Pi2-filtered ground magnetometer data from the CLK,\nDSO, and JAX stations. For each station, the two horizontal\ncomponents have been added and their power is plotted as a\ngreen line in each panel. The upper envelope of the green\ntrace is shown as the black line and was derived as a spline\nfit to the envelope of the power curves. During the time\nperiod surrounding the 0041 UT tooth, we can see that there\nwere multiple Pi2 bursts. Although the strongest of these\ncorresponds to the 0041:29 UT event, it is clear that the\nactivity was fairly complex and difficult to interpret. For the\nother teeth shown in Figure 20, the onset of Pi2 ULF\npulsations is much clearer.\n[76] In Figure 21, we present selected high-resolution\nmagnetometer data from the Japanese 210MM magnetom-\nFigure 21.

One second resolution H component\ndata from Ewa Beach (Hawaii), Onagawa, Bikia and\nMacQuarie Island are shown in Figure 21 in their raw form\n(top four traces) and in their Pi2 bandpass (40\u2013150 s)\nfiltered form (lower four traces). In Figure 22, 5 s X\ncomponent data from five stations in the \u2018Churchill line\u2019\n(Pinawa, Island Lake, Gillam, Fort Churchill, and Rankin\nInlet) are shown in a similar format. In both Figures 21 and\n22, we can see that the onset of each event was associated\nwith the occurrence of a Pi2 pulsation and either negative or\npositive H bays. Note also that the Pi2 pulsations do not\noccur at the same time everywhere. For example, Pi2\npulsations associated with the 0413:28 UT event begin\npromptly at Pinawa in conjunction with the sharp onset of\na negative H bay. However, as one moves poleward along\nthe Churchill line, both the onset of the H bay and Pi2\npulsations becomes more delayed. This behavior is very\nsimilar to that reported by Olson and Rostoker [1977]. The\npositive H component bays seen in the 210MM network for\nthis event are also substantially delayed.\n2.6. IMF and Solar Wind Conditions\n[77] During this event, ACE, Geotail and Wind were all\nsituated in the solar wind. As shown in Figure 23, at\n0415 UT on 11 August, ACE was far upstream at RGSM =\n(246.8, \u00027.6, 27.8) RE while Wind and Geotail were\nsituated closer to the Earth at RGSM = (\u000218.4, \u000259.8,\n11.5) RE and RGSM = (29.0, 2.6, \u00021.1) RE respectively.\nThe interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) (in GSM coordi-\nnates) and solar wind (SW) dynamic pressure variations\nfrom these spacecraft are shown in Figure 24. In this\noverview plot, none of the data have been time shifted to\naccount for propagation delay times. Nevertheless, we can\nsee that the behavior of the IMF at each location is very\nsimilar. At ACE, the IMF turns southward before 1900 UT\nFigure 24. IMF and solar wind dynamic pressure data from the ACE, Geotail, and Wind spacecraft.\nThe time shown ranges from 1800 UT on 10 August to 2400 UT on 11 August 2000.\nA06206 HENDERSON ET AL.: 10\u201311 AUGUST 2000 SAWTOOTH EVENT\n25 of 32\nA06206\non 10 August 2000 and remains negative for approximately\n24 hours afterward. Up until about 0500 UT on 11 August,\nthe IMF is moderately to strongly southward (\u0001\u000213 nT)\nand quite steady. After 0500 UT, the strength of the Bz\ncomponent decreases and a number of fluctuations and\ndiscontinuities are observed, particularly in the By and Bz\ncomponents. Just after 1800 UT, a shock was observed at\nACE which produced a very abrupt increase in the field\nstrength (mostly in By) and a simultaneous increase in the\ndynamic pressure. Except for a time delay, this behavior is\nessentially the same at all three spacecraft.\n[78] In addition to the large shock-associated increase just\nafter 1800 UT, the SW dynamic pressure at ACE exhibits a\nnumber of more gradual increases and decreases between\n1900 UT on 10 August and 0600 UT on 11 August. These\npressure fluctuations are not evident in either the Geotail or\nWind pressure data, but we note that Wind was substantially\nfar off from the Earth-Sun line, and the Geotail pressures\nduring this time period seem anomalously low compared to\neither ACE or Wind and may not be as robust as the ACE\nmeasurements In any case it is interesting to note that\nalthough the pressure fluctuations seem to be poorly corre-\nlated between the three spacecraft, the IMF measurements\nappear to be very well correlated.\n[79] In order to obtain a more accurate representation of\nthe IMF and SW variations that actually impacted the Earth,\nwe applied the Weimer et al. [2002] variable time delay\npropagation method to the ACE-Geotail and ACE-Wind\nsatellite pairs. In Figure 25 we show the results of this\nanalysis for the ACE-GEOTAIL pair in a format similar to\nthat used byWeimer et al. [2002]. The Geotail data is shown\nin black in the top and bottom three panels. The blue lines\nare the ACE IMF data propagated with the simple advec-\ntion-derived delay time (blue line in center panel). The red\nlines are the ACE IMF data propagated with the variable\ntime delay (red line in center panel) obtained via a modified\nWeimer et al. [2002] method. The variable time delay was\nobtained by optimizing the match between only the By and\nBz components and by reducing the initial segmentation to\n1 hour intervals rather than the 6-hour intervals used by\nWeimer et al. [2002]. In addition, we restricted the time\nadjustments for each iteration to be \u00b15% for all times except\nFigure 25. IMF at ACE propagated to the location of Geotail. The blue lines result from propagating\nthe ACE data with simple advection. The red lines are obtained from a modified Weimer method. The\nGeotail data are shown in black. The delay times derived for the advection and Weimer propagation\nmethods are shown in the fourth panel.\nA06206 HENDERSON ET AL.: 10\u201311 AUGUST 2000 SAWTOOTH EVENT\n26 of 32\nA06206\nbetween 1800 and 1930 UT on 11 August. In order to\ncapture the shock in this interval we increased the allowable\ntime adjustments to be \u00b130% there. These modifications\nwere made because the rapid fluctuations at and following\nthe shock seemed to confuse the unmodified algorithm and\nactually made the matches worse.\n[80] The variable time delay obtained from the ACE-\nGeotail analysis was used in conjunction with the observed\nsolar wind speed to propagate the ACE IMF and SW data to\nthe vicinity of the Earth\u2019s dayside magnetopause (we\nadopted a constant value of XGSM = 10 RE). The results\nare shown in Figure 26. The first seven panels show the\nIMF components (in GSM coordinates), the solar wind\nspeed, the proton number density, the proton-derived dy-\nnamic pressure and the y component of the SW electric\nfield. The eighth panel shows the so-called \u2018\u2018merging\nelectric field\u2019\u2019 which is defined as\nEM \u00bc V B2y \u00fe B2z\n\u0001 \u00021=2\nsin2 q=2\u00f0 \u00de \u00f02\u00de\nwhere q = tan\u00021(By\/Bz) [e.g., Kan and Lee, 1979]. For\ncomparison, the ninth panel in Figure 26 shows the PCN\nindex which is supposed to be sensitive to variations in the\nmerging electric field and\/or SW dynamic pressure fluctua-\ntions [Troshichev et al., 2000; Huang, 2005]. The vertical\ndashed lines are the tooth onset times as before.\n[81] One can immediately see that the 1846 UT event\nmatches precisely with the shock observed by ACE. In\naddition, the 0041 UT and 0413 UT teeth appear to be\nassociated with increases in the dynamic pressure and the\n0810 UT event appears to have been associated with a\nsudden reduction in the merging electric field (i.e., north-\nward turning of the IMF). For the other events, there is no\nobvious correlation with the IMF and SW variations. On the\nother hand, (as we have already mentioned) there is a strong\ncorrelation between the teeth and variations in the PCN\nindex. This suggests that the PCN index may not always\nrespond only to variations in the IMF and SW as has been\nassumed by others [e.g., Lee et al., 2004]. For example,\nfrom Figure 26, we can see that there was an abrupt increase\nin both the merging electric field and the dynamic pressure\nat around 0730 UT, but there was no apparent response\nvisible in the PCN index at that time. On the other hand, the\n0639 UT tooth was not associated with an obvious IMF or\nSW disturbance and yet it was associated with a significant\nincrease in the PCN index. This seems to suggest that the\nPCN index can also respond to a significant degree to the\nsubstorm associated DP-1 system as well as the convection\nassociated DP-2 system.\n[82] In the recent study of Lyons et al. [2005], they\nsuggested that potential triggers in the solar wind and\nIMF could be cancelled out in a variety of ways. For\nexample, if a northward turning is accompanied by a\npressure reduction, then the trigger is nullified. Although\nthis is an interesting hypothesis, we note that the \u2018\u2018null\u2019\u2019\nevents they identified during this event all occurred at times\nwhen the field was still stretching. Thus another interpreta-\ntion for why no substorms occurred in association with\nthose disturbances is that the magnetosphere was stable and\nnot yet receptive to external triggering. In addition, we note\nthat the \u2018\u2018NULL4\u2019\u2019 event identified by Lyons et al. [2005]\nappears to be just an artifact of the GSE coordinate system\nused by them to plot the Geotail data. Here we have plotted\nthe IMF data in GSM coordinates and we do not see a\nnorthward turning just prior to 10UT as they claim. Al-\nthough this does not invalidate their hypothesis on nullify-\ning effects, it does diminish the observational support for it.\n3. Discussion and Conclusions\n[83] In this paper, we have examined each of the flux\nenhancements associated with the 10\u201311 August 2000\nsawtooth event in detail. We find that all but one of the\nteeth were associated with injections at geosynchronous\norbit, and that most of the teeth were consistent with the\nhypothesis that they are predominantly caused by unusually\nlarge and longitudinally extended substorms. A few were\nunclear or complex, and the final flux enhancement at\n1845:36 UT was not a substorm but a solar wind shock-\nassociated disturbance. In addition, the presence of numer-\nous dispersionless flux perturbations in the LANL SOPA\ndata provides support for the hypothesis that solar wind\npressure variations can modulate the flux profiles to some\nextent.\n[84] For the substorm events we find that the geosyn-\nchronous particle flux behavior is not simultaneously dis-\npersionless around the globe. We also showed that the\nstrong onset-associated geosynchronous magnetic field\nFigure 26. IMF and SW measurements at ACE propa-\ngated to XGSM = 10 RE.\nA06206 HENDERSON ET AL.: 10\u201311 AUGUST 2000 SAWTOOTH EVENT\n27 of 32\nA06206\ndipolarization signatures are typically confined to the night-\nside and are particularly strong when the observing space-\ncraft was situated in the premidnight sector. Although\ndipolarization signatures were seen on the dayside for some\nevents, they were generally weaker and delayed in time\nrelative to the onset of the nightside dipolarizations. When\nglobal auroral imager data was available, all of the substorm\nevents displayed unambiguous storm time \u2018\u2018embedded sub-\nstorm onsets\u2019\u2019 in the dusk-to-midnight sector and subse-\nquently expanded eastward, westward and poleward in\ntypical substorm fashion. In addition, auroral zone and\nmiddle to low-latitude ground magnetometer data showed\ntypical storm-time substorm behavior including high-lati-\ntude negative H bays, middle- and low-latitude positive H\nbays, and a partial recovery in Sym-H associated with each\ntooth. In addition, each substorm tooth was associated with\nthe onset of Pi2 ULF pulsations.\n[85] For the final shock-associated flux increase, we\nfound that the geosynchronous particle fluxes increased in\na globally, near-simultaneous manner. However, the flux\nincreases, particularly for electrons, were weak in compar-\nison to the substorm-associated events. Also, as expected,\nthere was a significant and prompt increase in the magni-\ntude of the magnetic field throughout the inner magneto-\nsphere and only a very weak and transient dipolarization\nsignature was observed. Global auroral imager data avail-\nable during this event also showed a global brightening of\nthe aurora together with the onset of some high-latitude\nauroral dynamics, as expected. However, no substorm was\nobserved to develop in association with this activity. It is\nimportant to note that such shock-associated disturbances\nare not uncommon, especially during storm periods. On the\nother hand, solar wind shocks are not typically seen to occur\nwith a characteristic 2\u20134 hour periodicity. Although it was\napparent from the outset that the last flux increase was\nshock induced (and did not look very much like a typical\n\u2018\u2018tooth\u2019\u2019), we included it in our analysis in order to exem-\nplify the differences between such events and typical\nperiodic sawtooth disturbances.\n[86] In order to more clearly illustrate the typical auroral\nbehavior associated with sawtooth substorms, in Figure 27\nwe present a highly simplified schematic representation of\nthe auroral distribution during the course of a single tooth.\nSince this cartoon is meant to depict the types of processes\nthat can occur, the time between each frame is not uniform.\nThe top four frames span a time interval of 5\u201315 min or so\nand are meant to illustrate how auroral torches and omega\nband structures are related to PBIs (Poleward Boundary\nIntensifications) and equatorward moving auroral streamers.\nAs shown by Henderson et al. [2002], auroral streamers\nejected equatorward from the poleward portion of a double-\noval configuration can evolve into auroral torches and\nomega band structures. Active and dynamic double-oval\ndistributions are commonly observed during SMCs (Steady\nMagnetospheric Convection events) and can develop as a\nresult of prior substorm activity.\n[87] The middle four frames in Figure 27 span a time\nperiod of 1\u20132 hours and show how the double-oval con-\nfiguration thins in latitudinal extent during the stretching\nphase leading up to the tooth onset. Onsets like this have\nbeen referred to as \u2018\u2018embedded onsets\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018deeply embed-\nded onsets\u2019\u2019 [e.g., Murphree et al., 1993; Henderson et al.,\n2006] because they occur well away from the open field line\nregion and are \u2018\u2018embedded\u2019\u2019 in the most equatorward\nportions of a preexisting double-oval auroral configuration.\nNote that such a morphology is fully consistent with the\nAkasofu description of onset occurring on the most equa-\ntorward arc. Note also, that the onset region, in the premid-\nFigure 27. Highly simplified schematic representation of the life cycle of a sawtooth substorm.\nA06206 HENDERSON ET AL.: 10\u201311 AUGUST 2000 SAWTOOTH EVENT\n28 of 32\nA06206\nnight sector, is localized but develops adjacent to the\nbroadly distributed omega band region farther to the east.\nThe often observed coexistence of these features may lead\nto a perception that the onset region is far wider than it\nreally is.\n[88] The bottom four frames in Figure 27 span a time\nperiod of between 0.5\u20132 hours and show how the expan-\nsion phase typically evolves during sawtooth events. Al-\nthough the auroral bulge expands eastward, westward and\npoleward in fairly typical substorm fashion, a conspicuous\nfeature present during sawtooth substorms is the copious\nproduction of auroral streamers. While these also commonly\noccur during isolated substorms, they are much more\nintense and abundant during the late expansion phase of\nsawtooth substorms. They can occur in fairly complex\ngroupings, but are also frequently seen to occur in promi-\nnent quasiperiodic azimuthal \u2018\u2018spoke-like\u2019\u2019 patterns. As\ndiscussed by Henderson et al. [2002], these features are\nlikely the result of earthward propagation of BBFs in the tail\nwhich in turn are likely due to depleted (low-PVg) flux\ntubes generated as a result of localized and\/or patchy\nreconnection at an X line. We surmise that the copious\nproduction of these features during sawtooth substorms is\ndue to sustained, driven tail reconnection and that their\nsometimes prominent spatial periodicity may reflect a\nspatially periodic modulation of the reconnection rate,\nperhaps due to wave-modulated boundary conditions near\nthe reconnection region.\n[89] It is interesting to note that much of the auroral\nphenomenology portrayed in Figure 27 also applies quite\nwell to active intervals of SMC or \u2018\u2018convection bay\u2019\u2019 events.\nDuring SMCs, however, there can be no localized substorm-\nlike onsets by definition. Instead, the auroral dynamics\nduring SMCs behaves much like the activity seen during\nthe late expansion phase or early growth phase of sawtooth\nsubstorms, including the generation of streamers, torches\nand omega bands. Also note that if the time between\nsuccessive teeth during sawtooth events were to increase\nabove about 4\u20136 hours, the intertooth activity would be\nclassified as an SMC by definition. It is therefore evident\nthat SMCs and sawtooth events can be viewed as related\nphenomena. We suggest that the the level of external\ndriving and\/or the level of external IMF\/SW fluctuations\nmay determine whether an SMC or a sawtooth event\ndevelops.\n[90] On the question of tooth triggering, we found that\nsome of the teeth were clearly correlated with fluctuations in\neither the IMF or SW (or both), while for other teeth there\nwas no obvious correlation (see Table 2). Conversely, we\nobserved numerous fluctuations in the IMF and\/or SW at\ntimes between the tooth onsets. Although Lyons et al.\n[2005] and Lee et al. [2005] have proposed that potential\ntriggers can become nullified under certain conditions (e.g.,\na northward turning combined with a pressure reduction\nproduces no trigger), it is not clear that all of the intertooth\nfluctuations can be categorized as null events. For example,\nthere are multiple pressure pulses associated with the\n0413 UT event (which do not appear to be null events),\nbut there is only a single major tooth-like response (with\nsome smaller dispersionless fluctuations superimposed). In\naddition, the 2302:25 UT (10 August) event only appears to\nbe associated with positive deflection in BY at ACE which\nwould not normally be considered a trigger, but a tooth\ndevelops nevertheless. It is also interesting to note that one\nof the strongest examples of a null event in the Lyons et al.\n[2005] study occurred just prior to 1000 UT on 11 August.\nThey identified this as a null event because Geotail appar-\nently showed a large northward turning combined with a\nstrong reduction in the solar wind pressure. Thus they claim\nthat a tooth was averted by this null effect. However, it is\nimportant to note that in their study Lyons et al. [2005]\nappear to have used GSM coordinates for the ACE data and\nGSE coordinates for the Geotail data. It appears that the\ncoincident large increase in BY at this time results in a BZ\nincrease in GSE coordinates but not in GSM coordinates.\nThis can be seen by comparing our Figure 24 (all in GSM)\nwith Figure 5 presented by Lyons et al. [2005]. Since, in\nGSM coordinates, the IMF variations for this event would\nnot be considered a typical trigger it is questionable whether\nthe pressure reduction provided a nullifying effect.\n[91] Given that there are considerably more variations in\nthe SW\/IMF than there are teeth, it appears that once a tooth\nis initiated, the magnetosphere becomes unresponsive (in a\nmajor way) to these fluctuations for a typical 2\u20134 hour\nintertooth period. This is consistent with the idea that the\nteeth represent a nonlinear substorm-like reconfiguration of\nthe magnetosphere and strongly argues against the hypoth-\nesis that the teeth are produced as a \u2018\u2018directly driven\u2019\u2019\nresponse to solar wind pressure variations as suggested by\nLee et al. [2004]. Instead, we suggest that any spectrum of\nsolar wind disturbances (that are sufficiently closely spaced\nin time) will lead to the observed periodicity because the\ninternal stability threshold for substorm triggering is only\nbreached during the late growth phase of each substorm.\nTable 2.

[2004b, 2005] and Henderson et al.\n[2006], and we agree with many of the objections raised by\nHuang et al. [2005] regarding the Lee et al. [2004] study.\n[92] Finally, to illustrate that it is not unreasonable to\nattribute the observed delay times to substorm injections, we\nshow the (T89 Kp = 5 model) drift shells for particles with\n45\u0001 pitch angles that each of the geosynchronous spacecraft\nwere on at 0413 UT in Figure 28a. Figure 28b shows the\ncorresponding bounce-averaged gradient and curvature drift\nspeed for 400 keV protons (45\u0001 pitch angle) in each of these\nshells. The black circles in Figure 28a are the spacecraft\nlocations projected along field lines to the minimum B\nsurface of each drift shell. On the basis of an onset time of\n0413:28 UT and the observed arrival times in the P5\nchannel at 1989-046, 1994-084, and LANL-97A, the west-\nern edge of the injection region within each shell is inferred\nto be at the location of the white circles. Note that the drift\nshells are not the same for each spacecraft and that the drift\nspeed can be much greater on the nightside than on the\ndayside. From this crude calculation, we can see that the\ninjection region appears to follow a classic spiral-like\ngeometry in the dusk to midnight sector.\n[93] However, we note that there is considerable uncer-\ntainty in these results for at least four reasons. (1) Although\nthe flux increases appear to occur very abruptly in Figures 1\nand 4, it is actually quite difficult to measure the true arrival\ntimes to subminute accuracy due to the presence of numer-\nous small-scale fluctuations. (2) The SOPA data is spin\naveraged (i.e., it includes many pitch angles) and we have\nonly computed drift shells for particles with 45\u0001 pitch\nangles. (3) Although the T89 model is more realistic than\na dipole, the real field is certainly quite different during\nsawtooth events, and it is time varying. (4) The injection\nregion itself may be dynamic (e.g., it may propagate inward\nand\/or expand in azimuth). In order to robustly determine\nthe injection regions associated with sawtooth events, these\nissues need to be properly addressed.\n[94] On the basis of the observations presented here and\nelsewhere [e.g., Reeves et al., 2003; Huang et al., 2003a;\nHenderson, 2004; Henderson et al., 2006; Huang, 2005;\nKitamura et al., 2005], we conclude that the majority of the\nindividual teeth comprising sawtooth events are in fact\nsubstorms. In addition, we found that some apparent\ntooth-like flux increases (particularly in energetic protons)\ncan be produced by solar wind shocks and can result in a\nmagnetospheric response that is quite different from that of\na substorm. Since there are typically more potential IMF\/\nSW triggers available during sawtooth events, we propose\nthat the periodicity results because the magnetosphere only\nbecomes susceptible to (external or internal) triggering once\nit is driven beyond some stability threshold (or enters a\n\u2018\u2018metastable\u2019\u2019 configuration). A simple analog of this sce-\nnario is shown in Figure 29 in terms of a stochastic potential\nwell. During SMCs, we hypothesize that substorms are\naverted because the magnetosphere is able to process the\nenergy input in a quasi-continuous manner without\nFigure 28. Drift shells for 45\u0001 particles for the geosyn-\nchronous spacecraft at 0413 UT on 11 August 2000. The\nT89 Kp = 5 model was used. The black circles represent\nthe projection (along field lines) of the spacecraft location to\nthe minimum B surface of each drift shell. The white circles\nrepresent the location of the injection boundary derived\nfrom the observed drift of 400 keV protons.\nFigure 29. Schematic representation of stability in a\nstochastic potential well. The configuration remains stable\nto stochastic fluctuations of a given amplitude provided the\nwell is deep enough. Sawtooth events may evolve toward\nthe metastable configuration over a 2\u20134 hour period and\nbecome susceptible to external or internal triggering.\nA06206 HENDERSON ET AL.: 10\u201311 AUGUST 2000 SAWTOOTH EVENT\n30 of 32\nA06206\napproaching a configuration of marginal stability. In addi-\ntion, lower levels of external fluctuations (i.e., potential\ntriggers) may contribute to SMC-like behavior.\n[95] Note that it is highly likely that not all teeth, even\nones associated with clear dispersed injection signatures, are\nin fact substorms. Other processes, like poleward boundary\nintensifications combined with equatorward ejection of\nauroral forms (east-west inclined arcs and streamers) also\nappear to be able to produce sawtooth-like particle injec-\ntions. Investigation of this type of disturbance will be\ndeferred to a future study.\n[96] Acknowledgments. This research was supported at Los Alamos\nNational Laboratory by NSF GEM grant ATM-0202303.
