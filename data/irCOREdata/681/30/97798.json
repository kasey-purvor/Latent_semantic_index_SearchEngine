Lett., 37, L14501,\ndoi:10.1029\/2010GL043334.\n1. Introduction\n[2] Ice\u2010sheets are an important component of the climatic\nsystem, affecting atmospheric and oceanic circulation and\ncontrolling a major part of eustatic sea level change. In the\ncurrent context of global warming and consequent sea\u2010level\nrise, contribution from continental ice discharge from both\nGreenland and Antarctica has grown dramatically this last\ndecade [Velicogna, 2009]. However, ice loss as a result of\nenhanced flow in coastal regions is currently poorly under-\nstood, and the corresponding potential contribution to sea\u2010\nlevel rise in the twenty\u2010first century remains speculative. In\nparticular, enhanced coastal discharge is worrying for regions\nwhere the bedrock lies below sea level (i.e. marine ice\u2010sheets)\nbecause the retreat of ice\u2010streams may initiate large scale\ncollapse [Schoof, 2007].\n[3] Ocean warming, and subsequent melting of floating\nice\u2010sheet parts, is frequently invoked as a trigger of the\nobserved enhanced dynamical thinning of inland grounded\nice [Payne et al., 2004; Shepherd et al., 2004; Bindschadler,\n2006; Holland et al., 2008]. The main and striking argument\nusually given in support of this is the simultaneity of the\nobserved acceleration of different outlet glaciers. However,\nvery few ice flow modeling attempts have been undertaken\nin order to corroborate this hypothesis and to go beyond\nspeculation towards a comprehensive understanding of the\nunderlying processes [Pattyn et al., 2006;Walker et al., 2008,\n2009]. This is at least partly due to the long standing problem\nof finding a consistent approach to model the grounding line\nevolution (i.e., the evolution of the line that marks the limit\nbetween grounded and floating ice). Since the basal condi-\ntions of inland grounded ice and downstream floating ice\ntongues differ greatly, two distinct modes of deformation\ndominate these regions, respectively horizontal shearing and\nlongitudinal extension. Therefore, depending on the region\nbeing considered, different approximations of Stokes equa-\ntions are used by large scale ice\u2010sheet models, with important\ncoupling issues within the transition zone, where both defor-\nmation mechanisms are of the same magnitude. However,\nrecent results indicate that even depth\u2010integrated models can\nproduce consistent results if implemented numerically in a\ncareful way [Schoof, 2007; Durand et al., 2009; Goldberg\net al., 2009].\n[4] In this study, we use a finite element model which\nsolves the full Stokes equations (i.e quasi\u2010static flow equa-\ntions with all terms) to investigate the impact of melting\nbelow ice\u2010shelves on the dynamics of the grounding line and\ncorresponding impact on the evolution of the volume of the\nice\u2010sheet. The governing equations for the model and numer-\nical details have been described by Durand et al. [2009] and\nare listed in the auxiliary material.4 The new features intro-\nduced for this study, i.e. basal melting and back\u2010force from\nfloating ice, are detailed in Section 2. In Section 3, we dem-\nonstrate that buttressing forces exerted by the ice\u2010shelf turn\nout to be the dominant process when sub\u2010ice\u2010shelf melting\noccurs. However, the combination of both lateral resistance\nfrom side walls of the ice\u2010shelf with basal\u2010melting may\nlead to nontrivial behavior of marine ice\u2010sheet dynamics;\nin particular, an increase in the average melt rate can produce\na gain of ice\u2010sheet volume. This is illustrated in Section 4,\nwhile Section 5 contains a concluding discussion.\n2. Description of the Model\n[5] Themodel is presented in detail in the auxiliarymaterial\nand here we focus on the implementation of melting and\nbuttressing. Briefly, using the finite element model Elmer\/\nIce, we solve the full\u2010Stokes equations for an ice\u2010stream and\nassociated ice\u2010shelf in plane flow, the grounding line posi-\ntion at each time being fully determined by solving the\ncontact problem between the ice and the bedrock. In all the\napplications, the length of the ice\u2010shelf Lshelf is set constant,\n1LGGE, Universit\u00e9 Joseph Fourier\u2013Grenoble 1, CNRS, Saint\u2010Martin\nd\u2019H\u00e8res, France.\n2CSC, IT Center for Science Ltd., Espoo, Finland.\n3Science Programmes, British Antarctic Survey,Natural Environment\nResearch Council, Cambridge, UK.\nCopyright 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0094\u20108276\/10\/2010GL043334\n4Auxiliary material is available in the HTML. doi:10.1029\/\n2010GL043334.\nGEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 37, L14501, doi:10.1029\/2010GL043334, 2010\nL14501 1 of 5\nassuming implicitly that calving of icebergs always occurs\nat the same distance from the grounding line.\n[6] In this work, we extend a previously applied model\n[Durand et al., 2008, 2009] by including basal melting below\nthe ice\u2010shelf and lateral resistance on the ice\u2010shelf sides. The\nbasal melting is given as a normal flux ab? such that the\nvertical flux is ab = ab? [1 + (\u2202xzb)2]1\/2 in the bottom surface\nequation (S6). Parameterization of the melt rate ab?(x) fol-\nlows the position dependent distribution proposed byWalker\net al. [2008]:\nab?\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc ab?N 1\u0002\nx\u0002 xG\nLshelf\n\u0001 \u00032 x\u0002 xG\nLshelf\n\u0001 \u0003\u0001\u00021\n; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere xG \u2264 x \u2264 xG + Lshelf and N is a normalization factor\ndefined such that ab? = Lshelf\n\u22121 R xG\u00feLshelf\nxG\nab? dx stands for the\naverage melt rate. The melt distribution exponent b controls\nthe shape of the melting distribution and its influence is dis-\ncussed in detail below. Smaller b concentrates the melting\ntowards the grounding line. This simplified parameterization\nreflects the tendency of basal melting to be close to zero at\nthe grounding line, intense just downstream of the grounding\nline, and to decrease very rapidly seaward, as observed\n[Rignot and Jacobs, 2002] or modeled using physically\u2010\nbased ice\u2010ocean models [Walker and Holland, 2007; Payne\net al., 2007].\n[7] Typically, lateral resistance on ice\u2010shelf sides is either\nmodeled by introducing a back\u2010force at the front of the ice\u2010\nshelf [Dupont and Alley, 2005; Walker et al., 2008] or by\nadding some basal friction below the ice\u2010shelf [Van der Veen\nand Whillans, 1996; Pattyn et al., 2006]. In both cases, the\nadded resistance does not depend on the area of the ice\u2010shelf\/\nbay interface, and in the latter case artificially introduces\nshear deformation in the ice\u2010shelf when using a full\u2010Stokes\nmodel. In our approach, the lateral resistance is accounted\nfor over the whole area of the ice\u2010shelf\/bay interface by adding\na body force f in the momentum balance equation (S4),\nsuch that\nf \u00bc \u0002Kjujmlr\u00021u ; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere K and mlr are the lateral resistance coefficient and\nexponent, respectively. In the following applications, K is set\nto 0 for the grounded part (x \u2264 xG). On the ice\u2010shelf, K > 0,\nparameterizes the non\u2010linear resistance from the contact\nbetween the ice\u2010shelf and the bay walls. In our approach,\nthe resulting total back force is not constant but depends on\nthe ice\u2010shelf velocity field and the horizontal and vertical\ndimensions of the ice\u2010shelf. To simplify analysis of the\nresults, the length of the ice\u2010shelf Lshelf is set constant.\nExpression (2) for the lateral resistance force can be inferred\nfrom analytical solutions obtained for the flow of a very long\nflat weak\u2010bedded ice\u2010shelf. Such derivations, presented in\nthe auxiliary material, allow us to relate K to the ice\u2010shelf\nwidth and the rheological parameters of the ice. In the fol-\nlowing applications, when buttressing applies, K is chosen\naccording to (S19) assuming an ice\u2010shelf width of approxi-\nmately 100 km. The value of all the parameters entering the\nequations are given in Table S1.\n3. Grounding Line Retreats Caused by Decreased\nIce\u2010Shelf Buttressing\n[8] All the simulations discussed below are summarized\nin Table 1. We first simulate the effect of sub ice\u2010shelf\nmelting beneath an unconfined ice\u2010shelf, i.e. the lateral\nresistance body force f is set to 0 in the momentum balance\nequation (S4). An initial steady state is first obtained with\nzero melting prescribed, then three simulations are run with\nthe melt distribution exponent b = 1.1 and three different\naverage melt rates of ab? = 0.5 (Exp1\u2010a), 1.0 (Exp1\u2010b) and\n1.5 m a\u22121 (Exp1\u2010c). The geometry is allowed to evolve under\nthese new conditions until a steady state is achieved. The\ncorresponding geometries, surface velocities and prescribed\nmelt distributions are plotted in Figure S1 of Text S2 in the\nauxiliary material.\n[9] The ice\u2010shelf thins dramatically if melting is pre-\nscribed, and obviously, the larger the melt rate is, the thinner\nthe ice\u2010shelf becomes. However, no retreat of the grounding\nline is observed and changes in the grounded ice volume are\ninsignificant in this case where no back\u2010force is included.\nFurther increase of the melt rate would lead to disappearance\nof the ice\u2010shelf, but no movement of the grounding line\nwould precede the break off. This confirms previous results\nobtained by Pattyn et al. [2006]. Furthermore, a larger per-\nturbation of the model parameters (for example viscosity,\nbasal slipperiness, snow accumulation or sea level) than for the\ncase of no\u2010melting has to be applied to initiate any displace-\nment of the grounding line. This is illustrated in Figure S2 of\nthe Text S2 in the auxiliary material, where the response of\nthe grounding line to a 25% decrease of the flow rate factor A\nis shown for both cases with and without sub ice\u2010shelf\nmelting. The latter results indicate that in case of a two\u2010\ndimensional flow line model of a marine ice\u2010shelf with no\nbuttressing, melting at the ice\u2010sea interface has a stabilizing\neffect on the grounding line. It is uncertain whether this sta-\nbilizing effect, obtained here with a full\u2010Stokes model, could\nbe reproduced by depth\u2010integrated models which do not cap-\nture the physics very close to the grounding line. Stabilizing\nthe ice\u2010sheet as a consequence of melting is in clear contra-\ndiction to what is expected from observations, as the usual\nexplanation for the observed outlet glaciers acceleration and\nthinning lies in the effect of a warming ocean below the ice\u2010\nshelf [Payne et al., 2004; Shepherd et al., 2004; Bindschadler,\n2006; Holland et al., 2008]. The absence of buttressing\nforces is certainly the cause for this stabilizing effect as\ndemonstrated below.\nTable 1. Definition of All the Presented Simulations\nExperiment ab?

In the case of no melting (ab? = 0),\nstarting from a steady state geometry obtained with no lateral\nresistance, the inclusion of lateral resistance (K > 0) leads to\na significant thickening of the ice\u2010shelf and a substantial\nadvance of the grounding line of about 120 km (see for\ncomparison the steady surfaces Exp1\u2010ini in Figure S1 of\nText S2 and Exp2\u2010ini in Figure 1). Starting from this latter\nsteady state, three different melt rate distributions are pre-\nscribed. All of them have identical average melt rates of\nab? = 1.0 m a\n\u22121, but the melting is increasingly concen-\ntrated towards the grounding line by setting b = 1.5 (Exp2\u2010a),\n1.25 (Exp2\u2010b) and = 1.1 (Exp2\u2010c). Corresponding ice\u2010shelf\nsurface velocities and geometry for the steady state solutions\nare plotted in Figure 1. Clearly visible is the significant\ngrounding line retreat as the melting becomes more concen-\ntrated towards the grounding line as outlined by Schoof\n[2007]. This also confirms the conclusion of previous mod-\neling work done by Walker et al. [2008]. Note that some\nother simulations indicate an increased sensitivity with respect\nto the melting distribution in case of larger buttressing forces\n(data not shown).\n[11] It is obvious from Figure 1 that melting influences\nthe shape of the ice\u2010shelf and thus apparently decreases its\nvolume and in consequence \u2010 being a body force \u2010 also the\nbuttressing effect. This decrease in ice\u2010shelf volume, and the\nassociated decrease in the total buttressing force, explains\nthe grounding line retreats observed for these simulations.\nHowever, as sub ice\u2010shelf melting also has a strong feedback\non the velocity field within the ice\u2010shelf, and because the\nlateral resistance depends on the local velocity, the integrated\nbuttressing force depends also on the ice\u2010shelf velocities. As\nshown in Figure 1a, the mean surface velocity decreases as\nthe melt rate distribution is more concentrated towards the\ngrounding line. Compared with the ice\u2010shelf area decrease,\nit can induce a reverse effect on the resulting buttressing\nforce owing to the dependence of the lateral resistance law\nFigure 1.

Enhanced Melting May Lead to Grounding\nLine Advance\n[12] Motivated by the previous remark, we now try to\nanswer the question: is it possible to obtain a higher volume\nand a grounding line advance despite higher average melt\nrates? Starting from the steady state obtained with a but-\ntressed ice\u2010shelf (K > 0) with sub ice\u2010shelf melting distri-\nbution defined by ab? = 1.0 m a\n\u22121 and b = 1.1 (Exp2\u2010c in\nFigure 1), a third set of simulations is run with increasing\naverage melt rates from ab? = 1.1 (Exp3\u2010a), 1.2 (Exp3\u2010b) to\n1.6 m a\u22121 (Exp3\u2010a), but assuming less concentrated melting\nnear the grounding line (i.e., setting b = 1.5 instead of 1.1).\nGeometries were allowed to evolve to new steady states, and\nthe corresponding surface velocities, surface geometries and\napplied melt distributions are plotted in Figure 1d\u20131f. The\ntime evolution of the grounded ice\u2010sheet volume and the\ntotal buttressing force are plotted in Figure 2. Note that\nincreasing the average melt rate does not necessarily lead to\na grounding line retreat if the shape of the melt distribution is\nsimultaneously affected. For Exp3\u2010a and Exp3\u2010b, even if the\naverage melt rate is higher, a change in the melt distribution\nhas the effect of increasing the velocity field just downstream\nof the grounding line, and consequently results in an increase\nof the total buttressing force. In the present set of simulations,\na 60% increase in the average basal melt rate has to be applied\nin order to initiate a decrease of the buttressing forces that\nis followed by a retreat of the grounding line and a sig-\nnificant decrease in the ice\u2010sheet volume (Exp3\u2010c). This\nclearly illustrates the nontrivial consequences for marine ice\u2010\nsheet dynamics that can arise from the complex interactions\nbetween melting and lateral resistance.\n5. Conclusions\n[13] Using a full\u2010Stokes model, we have confirmed recent\nresults obtained with other models which use approxima-\ntions to the Stokes equations [Pattyn et al., 2006; Walker\net al., 2008]. The grounding line retreat that follows melting\nbelow the ice\u2010shelf arises from the decrease in buttressing\nforces. The basic view that, as a consequence of melting, the\nsea may progressively encroach on grounded ice is too sim-\nplistic and in certain cases wrong. Following on from this\ninitial result, studying the effect of melting in a plane strain\nproblem with no lateral resistance may lead to unrealistic\nresults. Certainly, for basic studies of the processes and\nqualitative results, lateral resistance forces have to be taken\ninto account to parameterize the back force induced by the\nfriction of the ice\u2010shelf on its embayment.\n[14] We have also confirmed that the distribution ofmelting\nis a key parameter in determining forces at the grounding line\nand needs accurate prescription to properly investigatemarine\nice\u2010sheet dynamics.Prescribing an average melt rate every-\nwhere under the ice\u2010shelf is not satisfactory. We also show\nthat interactions between melting and change in lateral resis-\ntance are far from being trivial. As an illustration, we showed\nin Section 4 that an increase in the global melting may actually\nlead to a grounding line advance and growth of the grounded\nice\u2010sheet providing that at the same time, the melting is less\nconcentrated near the grounding line.\n[15] From a broader perspective, this work has demon-\nstrated the limits of two\u2010dimensional flow line modeling of\nice\u2010shelves and, consequently has some important implica-\ntions for future marine ice\u2010sheet models. To make reliable\npredictions of grounded ice mass loss, the glaciological\ncommunity need: (i) robust three\u2010dimensional models which\nself\u2010consistently solve the problem of grounding line dynamics\nand (ii) a realistic consideration of lateral friction at the side\nof the ice\u2010shelf and below ice\u2010rises. From both modeling\nandmeasurements, wewill further need (iii) a high\u2010resolution\nknowledge of the mass exchange between the ocean and the\nice\u2010shelf, including its spatial distribution below the ice\u2010\nshelf. For this latter point, accurate modeling of sub ice\u2010shelf\nmelting requires coupling of an ice\u2010sheet model and an ocean\nmodel, and a full description of ice\u2010ocean interactions with\ntheir complete physics. If we fail to make major advances\non the previously mentioned points, prediction of ice\u2010sheet\ncontribution to sea\u2010level rise will remain mainly speculative.\n[16] Acknowledgments.
