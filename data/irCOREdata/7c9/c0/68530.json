Calculations and measurements of the corre-\nsponding activation energies are in good agreement, and have enabled the position\nof the kinetic phase transition (KPT) line to be established over its full range.\nThe kinetics of an oscillator is a long-standing and important problem of clas-\nsical and quantum statistical physics, for two reasons. On the one hand, many\nreal physical systems can be well modelled by such oscillators and, on the other,\ncomparatively simple solutions can be obtained for models of this kind, in particu-\nlar for an underdamped nonlinear oscillator (see [1]). Interesting new phenomena\narise if an underdamped nonlinear oscillator is driven by a nearly resonant force.\nSince the frequency of the eigenvibrations of the oscillator depends on their ampli-\ntude, there is a certain range of the forcing amplitude in which there are co-existing\nstable states of vibration with comparatively small and large amplitudes respec-\ntively. The corresponding eigenfrequencies are self-consistently in comparatively\nbad or good resonance with the field frequency WF. The bistability of a periodi-\ncally driven oscillator has been observed for cyclotron motion of an electron in a\nquadrupole trap [2]. It has been discussed also in the context of optical bistability\n[3], and in acoustics and engineering.\nAn oscillator bistable in a periodic field provides an example of a bistable\nsystem far from thermal equilibrium, for which the co-existing attractors are limit\ncycles. The quantities of particular interest and importance for nonequilibrium\nbistable systems are the probabilities Wmn of fluctuational transitions between\nthe stable states (n,m = 1,2). For weak intensity of the fluctuations (induced by\nexternal noise, or resulting from coupling to a thermal bath) these probabilities\nare very much smaller than the characteristic reciprocal relaxation time( s) of the\nsystem t;:l. In the general case, the probabilities W12 and W21 of the transitions\n1 -+ 2 and 2 -+ 1 are strongly different (exponentially different, for Gaussian\nlpermanent address: VNIIMS, Andreevskaya nab. 2, Moscow, 117965, Russia.\n2Present address: Dept. of Engineering, University of Warwick, Coventry, CV 4 7AL, UK.\nOnly within a narrow range of the parameters of the system are WI and W2 of\nthe same order of magnitude. In this range a kinetic phase transition occurs\nand although the fluctuations about each stable state are small, large fluctuations\nthen come into play, related to transitions between the states. A feature of these\nfluctuations is that they are infrequent, the characteristic time scale being,....W-1,\nand they would therefore be expected to give rise to high supernarrow peaks (of\nwidth ,....W ~ t;l)in the spectral density of the fluctuations (SDF) and in the\nsusceptibility at the frequency of the co-existing limit cycles and its overtones (we\nnote that a nonequilibrium system can amplify a weak signal, i.e., the imaginary\npart of the susceptibility can be negative) [1]. The intensity of the peaks should\n(and for the SDF does [4])display an extremely sharp dependence on the distance\nto the transition point. Since the supernarrow peaks in the susceptibility are due\nto fluctuations (caused by the noise driving the oscillator), then, in a certain range\nof the noise intensity B, the amplitude of a signal due to an additional weak force\nshould increase with increasing B. This is a prerequisite for stochastic resonance\n(SR) - an interesting phenomenon that has attracted much attention recently in\nview of various applications [5]. In contrast to the \"conventional\" SR observed\nat low frequencies, in the case of a periodically driven oscillator there arises [6]a\nhigh-frequency form of stochastic resonance (HFSR).\nWepresent below some results on fluctuations in a nonlinear oscillator obtained\nrecently by means of analog simulation and theoretically. The model investigated\nis described by the equation\nf, lewl ~ WF, ew = WF - Wo, (J(t)f(t')) = 2fBe(t - t')\nHere, f(t) is Gaussian white noise. For small friction coefficient f and small\nfrequency detuning of the driving force with respect to the eigenfrequency of the\noscillator Wo, and also for a comparatively small field amplitude F, the motion\nof the oscillator is primarily vibrations at a frequency WF with slowly varying\namplitude and phase. The dynamics of the latter depends on the values of two\ndimensionless parameters, f3 and TJ, and also on the dimensionless noise intensity\nf3 = 3hlF2 \/32w~lewI3, TJ = f\/lewl, a = 31\"YIB\/16w~f (3)\n(the kinetics of slow variables is basically the same whether the model (2) is used\nor fluctuations are assumed to be due to the coupling.to a thermal bath; the main\npoint is that the power spectrum of the noise f(t) should be flat in a range ~ lewl\nabout WF). The range of f3, TJ where the two at tractors coexist as calculated and\nmeasured in the experiment is enclosed by the approximately triangular region\nshown in Fig.I. On the upper branch of f3(TJ2) the small-amplitude limit cycle\n(the stable state 1) merges with an unstable one and disappears, whereas on the\nlower branch this occurs to the large-amplitude limit cycle (the stable state 2). A\nfluctuating periodically driven\nnonlinear oscillator was one of the\nfirst physical systems without de-\ntailed balance for which the prob-\nabilities of transitions between co-\nexisting stable states were ana-\nlyzed [7]. It followsfrom the the-\nory [7] that, to logarithmic accu-\nracy, the dependence of Wnm on\nthe noise intensity is of activation\ntype,\nThe values of the activation ener-\ngies Rt\u20222 for the transitions from\nthe states 1,2 depend on the pa-\nrameters p, 1\/ and are given by the\nsolution of a variational problem.\nSuch an activation dependence on the noise intensity for a system without detailed\nbalance has indeed been observed in our experiments. The experimental mean first\npassage times (MFPT) and acti-\nvation energies Rt\u20222 are shown in\nFigs.2 and 3. As expected, the\nactivation energy for escape from\nthe small-amplitude limit cycle\ndecreases with increasing P (i.e.,\nwith increasing field amplitude)\nuntil Rt becomes equal to 0 at the\nbifurcation point where the sta-\nble state disappears. Conversely,\nR2 increases with increasing p.\nThe data are in reasonably good\nagreement with the results of the\nnumerical solution of the varia-\ntional problem for Rt,2: there are\nno adjustable parameters in ei-\nther the theory or the experiment.\nIt followsfrom the expressions\n(1),(4) that for the most ofthe valuesof p, 7] the ratio ofthe stationary populations\nof the states Wt\/W2 ex: exp (-(R2 - Rd\/a) is either exponentially large or small,\nand only for Rt ~ R2 are the populations of the same order of magnitude.\nFig.l The phase diagram as calculated\n(full lines) and measured (squares [4]). The\ncalculated KPT line (dashed) is compared\nwith experimental measurements (circles).\n-1 8ex.\nFig.2 Dependence of the experimental\nMFPT on reciprocal noise intensity for 7]2 =\n0.033.\nThe KPT phase-transition line\nf3c(TJ2) as given by the condition\nR1 = R2 is shown dashed in Fig. 1.\nIt was found analytically for small\nvalues of .,,2 (we note that f3c is\na nonanalytic function of .,,2 for\nsmall .,,2, f3c( .,,2) - f3c(O) ex .,,)\nand in the vicinity of the spin-\node point K, and it was evaluated\nnumerically in between using the\ncalculated values of R1,2' The ex-\nperimental points (circles), which\nwere obtained from the condition\nW12 = W21, are seen to be in good\nagreement with the theory. The\nsupernarrow peaks in the SDF, corresponding to those anticipated [7] in the sus-\nceptibilityof the system, were observed previously [4].\u2022In conclusion, we note that the calculated and measured activation energies are\nin satisfactory agreement and that they have enabled us to establish the position\nof the KPT line (Fig.1) over the full range of.,,2 from zero up to the spinode point\nK.\nThe work was supported by the Science and Engineering Research Council\n(UK), by the EC, by the Royal Society of London, and by the Gosstandart of\nRussia.\n0.00.0\nFig.3 The experimental and theoretical\nactivation energies for .,,2= 0.033.\n1.
