The paper highlights the important factors, as perceived by teachers, \nthat impact on why teachers enter the profession, and also why they choose to leave. \n \nSample \nThe survey involved 246 teachers in England and Wales, teaching the shortage subjects of English, \nmaths and science.  The sample was chosen so that 25% of the teachers taking part in the study would \nbe working in London.  Our intention was to have sample numbers for teachers inside and outside \nLondon from which meaningful comparisons could be made regarding their views, and so highlight \nparticular issues that were important for teachers in London.  The 75% sample not from London was \ngeographically representative of the rest of England and Wales.   \n \nDesign and Methods \nPrior to the survey, a provisional examination of recent research findings was carried out, leading us to \ncategorise relevant issues into three areas: (i) Reasons for wanting to enter teaching, (ii) Reasons for \nnot wanting to enter teaching and (iii) Reasons for wanting to leave teaching.  The telephone survey \nwith teachers therefore looked at these three broad areas.  A pilot study was carried out with 22 \nteachers, trialling the survey questions to be used in the telephone interviews.  With the agreement of \nthe teachers, the telephone interviews were recorded to aid the data gathering process.  Copies of the \ninterview \u2018script\u2019 were sent out beforehand to the teachers being interviewed, in order to try and \nreassure teachers that no \u2018unexpected\u2019 questions would be asked of them, and to also give teachers the \nopportunity to provide considered responses during the interviews.   \n \nResults \nThe survey found that although more \u2018intrinsic\u2019 and \u2018altruistic\u2019 reasons were given by teachers for \ngoing into teaching, the issues of workload and pupil behaviour were found to be most important in \ndissuading teachers from entering the profession or possibly causing them to leave teaching.   \n \nConclusions \nThe study therefore concluded that in order to have an impact on teacher numbers, then these two \nissues must be seen to be tackled from the perspectives of teachers.   \n \nKeywords: Teacher Recruitment; Teacher Retention, Telephone Survey, Shortage Subjects \n \n \n                                                 \n\u2217 CEM Centre, Durham University, Mountjoy Research Centre 4, Stockton Road, Durham, DH1 3UZ, \nUK. E-mail: patrick.barmby@cem.dur.ac.uk \n 2 \n \nIntroduction \n \nThe shortage of teachers in England and Wales continues to be a high profile area of scrutiny.  \nParticular subjects (including mathematics, science and English) are categorised by the \nTeacher Training Agency (TTA) as priority or shortage subjects, and London in particular has \nexperienced particular shortages in teacher numbers over recent years (Hutchings et al., \n2000).  The fact that the Government Select Committee for Education at the beginning of the \n1990s highlighted the \u201cdifficulty providing properly qualified teaching in mathematics, \nphysics, design and technology and modern languages\u201d, and \u201cthe seriousness of the current \nsituation in London\u201d (Grace, 1991), emphasises the long-standing nature of these concerns.   \nIn his examination of teacher training systems in England, Sir Stewart Sutherland \n(1997), in the Dearing Report on Higher Education, called for \u201can assessment of the \neffectiveness of the current arrangements for recruitment and the desirability of introducing a \nwider range of incentive measures to improve recruitment in priority subject areas\u201d.  He also \nsuggested that \u201cfurther work should be undertaken to establish more accurately the reasons \nfor, and responses to, wastage.\u201d  In recent years, the UK Government has introduced a \nnumber of initiatives to tackle teacher recruitment problems (Menter, 2002); these include \ntraining salaries or bursaries for those undertaking teacher training, a \u2018Golden Hello\u2019 scheme \nfor those entering shortage subject areas, major advertising campaigns and the provision of \nalternative routes into teaching.  In addition, the Repayment of Teachers\u2019 Loans Scheme was \nintroduced as a pilot initiative over the period 2002 to 2004. This was designed to impact on \nteacher retention as well as recruitment by paying off student loans of teachers over a ten-year \nperiod whilst teachers remained in the profession.   \n \nRecent government figures do seem to indicate that improvements are now being seen in \nteacher numbers.  In England, the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) teachers has seen a \nsteady rise from 399,200 in 1997 to 427,700 in 2004 (DfES, 2004).   The number of full-time \nteacher vacancies in nursery, primary and secondary schools has fallen from a peak of 4,700 \nin 2001 to 2,410 in 2004.  Wales has also seen an increase from 26,352 FTE teachers in \n1997\/98 to 27,947 in 2003\/04 (National Assembly in Wales, 2004).  On the basis of their \nanalysis of recent official figures, See, Gorard and White (2004) concluded that \u201cthere is no \nspecial crisis in teacher supply and demand in Wales (or indeed in England) \u2026 There are \nmore teachers in England and Wales now than there has ever been, and pupil numbers are \nnow declining.  Over the long-term and for the immediate future, the trend for pupil-teacher \nratios is downward.\u201d Within these figures however, London was still seen to experience \ngreater shortages than other geographical areas, with vacancy rates (defined as vacancies as a \npercentage of teachers in post) in 2004 of 1.0% and 1.6% in the nursery\/primary and \nsecondary sectors respectively, compared to overall rates in England of 0.5% and 0.9% \n(DfES, 2004) and 0.3% and 0.5% in 2003\/04 for Wales (National Assembly in Wales, 2004).  \nIn addition, another issue of concern was the wastage of teachers (defined by Smithers and \nRobinson, 2004, as \u201cfull-time teachers leaving but not moving to a full-time post in another \nmaintained school.\u201d)  Government figures showed that in 2000\/01, 33,710 teachers left full-\ntime teaching in England, a wastage rate of 9.3% (DfES, 2003), and 1,940 full-time teachers \nleft in Wales, a wastage rate of 7.8% (National Assembly of Wales, 2003).  Once again, \nLondon had a higher wastage rate than the other geographical regions with 11.3% for full-\ntime staff during 2000\/01.   \nThe House of Commons Education and Skills Committee, in its recent report into \nteacher recruitment and retention in secondary education (House of Commons Education and \nSkills Committee, 2004), concluded that \u201cwe did not find evidence of endemic problems with \nretention and recruitment.  The number of teachers resigning has fallen, actions taken by the \nGovernment to promote teaching as a career have boosted recruitment to initial teacher \ntraining, and a fall in the school population which is beginning to affect primary schools rolls \nwill from 2005 start to impact on secondary schools, thus reducing the demand for teachers.\u201d  \nHowever, specific recruitment and retention issues were identified by the report.  This \n 3\n \nincluded the issue of shortage subjects once again, recommending that \u201cproblems with the \ndesignated shortage subjects, and with others, need to be closely monitored to make sure that \npolicies to encourage people to teach in these subjects are effective.\u201d \n \nIn this paper therefore, we report on the findings of a study which examined the views of \nteachers of shortage subjects in England and Wales with regards to issues affecting teacher \nrecruitment and retention.  As such, the paper focuses on the situation in England and Wales \nspecifically, in particular with regards to the focus of the literature review carried out as part \nof the study.  However, it is recognised that the problem of teacher shortages is not just \nconfined to England and Wales.  The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment (OECD) has highlighted that \u201cthere are serious concerns in many OECD \ncountries about how to maintain an adequate supply of good quality teachers\u201d (OECD, 2004).  \nThere are once again specific shortages identified in the subjects of computer science, \nmathematics, technology, foreign languages and the sciences.  The OECD recognises that in \naddition to salary levels, other factors such as work conditions, job security and job \nsatisfaction contribute to the attractiveness of teaching as a profession in these different \ncountries.  It is therefore hoped that the present study, in looking at recruitment and retention \nissues, can also contribute to this wider examination of teacher supply in other countries. \n \n \nLiterature Review \n \nPrior to the reported survey of teachers in England and Wales, a review of relevant studies in \nthe areas of teacher recruitment and retention was carried out.  This review of literature was \ncarried out in January 2004.  The method used for the review was based on the one employed \nby Spear, Gould and Lee (2000) in their review of factors motivating and demotivating \nteachers.  The search was carried out using the electronic database of the British Education \nIndex, using the search terms \u2018teacher recruitment\u2019, \u2018teacher retention\u2019, \u2018teacher attrition\u2019, \n\u2018teacher motivation\u2019, \u2018job satisfaction\u2019 and \u2018teacher morale\u2019.  As in the search carried out by \nSpear, Gould and Lee, and because we were examining the views of teachers in England and \nWales, those studies that were not carried out wholly or partly in the UK were not considered \nin this search.  In addition, in order not to duplicate the findings of the previous search, those \ncitations that were published before 1999 were also not included (the review by Spear, Gould \nand Lee covered citations up to 1999).   \nThe total number of citations obtained using this method was 72.  Having obtained \nthe citations, a search was carried out for the studies, both in electronic and paper form.  \nDuring this search, some of the references could not be found.  In addition, reading through \nthe obtained papers, other studies not originally identified in the database search were \nhighlighted as important from the references in these papers.  These included papers \npublished prior to 1999 that provided background information on teacher recruitment and \nretention.  Other papers obtained from the original sweep were subsequently found to be not \nrelevant to the search. From the 72 citations identified above therefore, the literature search \nevolved to encompass 41 sources of information. Full details of this literature review are \nprovided in elsewhere (Barmby and Coe, 2004).  However, as background to this present \nstudy, we can draw on the findings of some of the references from the review, in order to \nidentify some of the relevant issues concerning teacher recruitment and retention.   \n \nIn examining the issues affecting teacher numbers, recent literature on recruitment can be \ncategorised as looking at three broad areas; reasons why people take up teaching as a career, \nreasons why people have been deterred from entering teaching and suggestions for improving \nrecruitment into teaching.  Looking firstly at the reasons for entering teaching, Kyriacou and \nCoulthard (2000) categorised these reasons as \n \n 4 \n \n\u201c(1) altruistic reasons: these reasons deal with seeing teaching as a \nsocially worthwhile and important job, a desire to help children \nsucceed, and a desire to help society improve; \n(2) intrinsic reasons: these reasons cover aspects of the job activity \nitself, such as the activity of teaching children, and an interest in \nusing their subject matter knowledge and expertise; and \n(3) extrinsic reasons: these reasons cover aspects of the job which are \nnot inherent in the work itself, such as long holidays, level of pay, \nand status.\u201d \n \nThe analysis of relevant literature by Moran et al. (2001) concluded that \u201cthe reasons for \nchoosing the teaching profession as a career have been predominantly altruistic and intrinsic\u201d.  \nCarrington and Tomlin (2000), in their survey of 289 PGCE students from ethnic minority \nbackgrounds, also stated that the \u201ctrainees tended to stress the importance of intrinsic (rather \nthan extrinsic) considerations when describing their reasons for wanting to teach or, \nalternatively, emphasised the social dimensions of teaching (e.g. likes working with people, \nincluding children)\u201d.  Indeed, looking at individual reasons for wanting to teach from recent \nstudies, intrinsic or altruistic reasons were most frequently give by teachers, for example \nwanting to work with children  (Johnston, McKeown and McEwen, 1999a, Moran et al., \n2001, Smithers and Robinson, 2001, Thornton and Reid, 2001, Thornton, Bricheno and Reid, \n2002), perceived job satisfaction (Johnston, McKeown and McEwen, 1999b, Thornton and \nReid, 2001, Thornton, Bricheno and Reid, 2002), enjoyment of subject (Kyriacou and \nBenmansour, 1999) and positive experiences of teaching in the past (Hammond, 2002).  The \nonly extrinsic reason that emerged from any of the studies as the most cited reason to enter \ninto teaching was \u2018long holidays\u2019 (Kyriacou and Coulthard, 2000, Rawlinson et al., 2003). \nFinancial considerations such as salary were only ranked within the top few reasons \nfor going into teaching in two studies (Johnston, McKeown and McEwen, 1999b, Rawlinson \net al., 2003).  Therefore, when considering the reasons why people entered into teaching, we \ncould conclude that financial considerations, and indeed extrinsic reasons in general, do not \nplay an important part.  However, this is only half the story.  If we instead look at reasons \nwhy people did not choose to go into teaching, we see that external considerations play a \nmore important role.  In their interviews of 148 prospective primary teachers, Thornton, \nBricheno and Reid (2002) found that pay was the thing that could most discourage people \nfrom becoming teachers, followed by workload and then the image and status of teaching.  \nLikewise, Carrington and Tomlin (2000) found that PGCE students \u201cperceive the job as \ninvolving considerable stress, long hours, excessive paperwork and relatively low \nremuneration.\u201d  Undergraduate students in geography, in the study by Rawlinson et al. \n(2003), identified pay, student behaviour, stress, government attitude, low morale and long \nhours as deterrents to enter into teaching.  Another study of undergraduates, this time at York \nUniversity by Kyriacou and Coulthard (2000), identified dealing with disruptive pupils, the \namount of bureaucratic tasks, school funding, OFSTED inspections, the government\u2019s \ncommitment towards education and the media image of teachers as factors that discouraged \npeople from teaching.  When considering the recruitment of teachers into the profession \ntherefore, it is important to consider this tension between largely intrinsic or altruistic factors \nwhich are attracting people into teaching, and what appear to be largely extrinsic reasons that \ndissuade people from entering the profession.   \nLooking now at the reasons put forward in recent studies for leaving teaching, \nworkload, government initiatives and stress were the three most important reasons highlighted \nby Smithers and Robinson (2003).  In the study of mature students entering teaching by \nWhitehead, Preece and Maughan (1999), heavy workload, classroom management and \ninsecurity due to possible redundancy were highlighted as issues of concern.  Hutchins et al. \n(2000) looked specifically at the situation in London.  The reasons given in their study of \nteachers leaving the profession were issues with school management, hours worked and pupil \n 5\n \nbehaviour, followed by lack of promotion prospects, school resources, too many \nresponsibilities and pay. \nIn addition to looking at specific reasons why people are choosing to leave the \nteaching profession, we can also consider the related areas of job satisfaction, morale and \nmotivation amongst teachers.  The review by Spear, Gould and Lee (2000) devoted specific \nchapters on the areas of job satisfaction and teacher morale.  Evans (2001) found \u201cmorale, job \nsatisfaction and motivation to be influenced much less by externally initiated factors such as \nsalary, educational policy and reforms and conditions of service, than by factors emanating \nfrom the more immediate context within which teachers work: school-specific or, more \nprecisely, job-specific factors.  As a result, leadership emerged as a key attitudes-influencing \nfactor.  Underpinning this, three factors were highlighted as being influential upon morale, \njob satisfaction and motivation: realistic expectations, realistic perspective and professionality \norientation.\u201d  The expectations that a teacher has, the perspective that they come from and the \nparticular knowledge, skills and procedures that define the professionality of a teacher was \nused to explain why morale, satisfaction and the motivation of teachers could vary such a lot \nfrom case to case (Evans, 2000).  For example, issues that could bring about a resignation for \none teacher could be minor issues for another teacher.  Within this diversity of responses, it \nwas identified that \u201cinstitutional leadership and management can do much to foster positive \njob-related attitudes by helping to create and sustain work contexts that are conducive to high \nmorale, job satisfaction and motivation\u201d (Evans, 2001). \nHood (2001) also identified that \u201cleadership, through staff empowerment and human \nresource development, is the means of encouraging the formation of the necessary \ncollaborative cultures which will facilitate the motivation of staff\u201d.  Jones (2002) identified \n\u201cpaperwork, over-regulation, planning and testing\u201d as negative issues impacting on teacher \nmorale, while the survey of the quality of working life amongst teachers by NFER (Sturman, \n2002) identified the dissatisfaction with salaries for teachers and that job commitment was \naffected by the levels of job satisfaction and stress amongst teachers.  \n \n \nBackground to the present study \n \nIn this study, we present the results of a survey carried out with 246 teachers from England \nand Wales, examining their views on why teachers enter the teaching profession, why they \nmight be deterred from doing so, and the possible reasons for leaving teaching.  The research \nwas carried out as part of a DfES-funded evaluation of their Repayment of Teachers\u2019 Loans \nScheme (see Barmby and Coe, 2004).  Although this evaluation specifically concentrated on \nthe impact of this financial incentive on teachers\u2019 decisions, general questions regarding \nrecruitment and retention were also asked of teachers.  This study focuses on these general \nquestions, presenting both quantitative and qualitative data on teachers\u2019 views on teacher \nrecruitment and retention.  As highlighted in the introduction to this paper, particular areas of \nconcern within teacher recruitment and retention included particular shortage subjects and \nalso the situation in London.  As a result, this study focuses on both of these areas of concern. \nThe survey was carried out with English, Mathematics and Science teachers, with a larger \nthan representative number teaching in London so that comparisons could be made between \nteachers inside and outside the capital.   \n \n \nMethodology \n \nThis study of teachers\u2019 views on recruitment and retention was carried out over the period \nJanuary to July 2004.  The views of teachers were obtained through structured interviews \ncarried out by telephone, allowing us to interview teachers spread throughout a wide \ngeographical area (England and Wales) in a relatively short space of time.  With the \nagreement of the teachers, these interviews were recorded to aid the data gathering process.  \n 6 \n \n                                                \nIn carrying out these interviews, copies of the interview \u2018script\u2019 were sent out to the teachers \nbeing interviewed as well as being used by those doing the interviewing.  This was done in \norder to try and reassure teachers that no \u2018unexpected\u2019 questions would be asked of them, and \nto also give teachers the opportunity to provide considered responses during the interviews.  \nThe format of the individual questions and the interview as a whole were developed during a \npilot phase carried out with 22 teachers at the beginning of the study.  \nThe teachers selected for this study were from those taking part in the Repayment of \nTeachers\u2019 Loans Scheme from the start of the scheme in September 2002 up to just before \nthis study in November 2003.  As the scheme was offered to those who had obtained a \nteaching position within a period of seven months of gaining Qualified Teaching Status \n(QTS), these teachers were therefore in their first two years of their teaching careers. The \nstudy specifically focused on those teaching the shortage subjects of English, mathematics \nand science.  The majority of these teachers were from the secondary sector, although a small \nminority were from the Further Education and primary sectors as well1.  Teachers\u2019 details, \nincluding home addresses and where they were teaching, were provided for the purposes of \nthe study by the DfES from records held by the Student Loans Company2.  Overall, there \nwere 5,510 teachers in the population of those taking part in the scheme and teaching these \nspecific subjects. \nFor the pilot study, 100 teachers were selected at random from this database of \nteachers and contacted by letter. Teachers were asked whether they would be willing to take \npart in this study, and if so, whether they would provide a contact telephone number.  Two \nweeks after the initial letter, a follow up letter was sent to teachers who had not replied.  \nOverall, 31 teachers agreed to take part in the pilot study.  Because we had anticipated a \nsmaller response rate, 7 of these teachers were subsequently used for the main part of the \nstudy.  Of the remaining 24 teachers, 2 could not be contacted during the period of the pilot \nstudy, leaving 22 interviews successfully completed. \nFor the main study, the aim was to interview 200 teachers, with the sample weighted \nso that 25% of these were teaching in London.  Rather than obtaining a geographically \nrepresentative sample (the actual percentage of teachers from London in the population of \nthose taking part in the financial incentive was 11.4%), our intention was to have sample \nnumbers for teachers inside and outside London from which meaningful comparisons could \nbe made regarding their views, and so highlight particular issues that were important for \nteachers in London.  Therefore, based on the response rate to the pilot study, 800 letters were \nsent out to teachers.  200 of these teachers were from London, with the remaining 600 spread \nover the remaining government regions of England and Wales.  313 teachers subsequently \nagreed to take part in the study (39% response rate) although 12 of these were discounted as \nthe replies were received only after the main sample had been chosen.  Together with the 7 \nteachers carried over from the pilot study, 308 teachers were therefore available for the main \npart of the evaluation.  From these 308 teachers, 276 teachers were then selected to take part.  \nThis additional sampling was carried out because the response of teachers had been greater \nthan expected and a reduction in numbers was required so that interviews could be carried out \nwithin the time allocated for the interviews.  Subsequently, of the 276 teachers selected, 26 \nteachers could not be contacted during that period and 4 teachers withdrew from the study.  In \ntotal therefore, 246 interviews were successfully completed in the main part of the study.  \nThis sample was representative of the original population in terms of gender, and also the \nlocation of teachers (although including the weighting towards London).   \n \n \nResults of the study \n \n \n1 The resulting sample included 4.1% of teachers from the Further Education sector and 1.6% of who \nwere specialist primary school teachers. \n2 The Student Loan Company was responsible for administering the loan repayments for teachers. \n 7\n \nWe now present the results of the study based on the responses of the teachers to the \ninterview questions.  In examining the past literature on teacher recruitment and retention, we \nidentified three areas to be focused upon; the reasons given for entering teaching, reasons \ngiven by people for not entering teaching, and reasons given by teachers for leaving the \nprofession.  Therefore, in summarising the results, we present the findings of the study under \neach of these headings. \n \n \nReasons given for entering teaching \n \nTeachers were asked to rate the importance of possible motivations in attracting them into the \nprofession.  The teachers were asked to use a four-point scale for the rating, 1 being not \nimportant at all, 2 being of some importance, 3 being quite important and 4 being very \nimportant.  The percentages of teachers responding \u2018quite important\u2019 or \u2018very important\u2019 for \neach motivation are given in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Teachers\u2019 ratings of the importance of possible motivations in attracting them \ninto teaching \nMotivation % responding \u2018quite important\u2019 or \n\u2018very important\u2019 \nCategory (from  \nFactor Analysis) \nHelping children succeed 97.2 Children-orientated \nMentally stimulating \nwork \n95.5 Intrinsic \nJob satisfaction 95.5 Intrinsic \nImparting knowledge to \npupils \n91.9 Altruistic\/ Children-\norientated \nWorking with children 85.4 Children-orientated \nVariety in teaching 85.4 Intrinsic \nJob security 82.9 Extrinsic \nContribution to society 82.9 Altruistic \nWorking in classroom 80.5 Children-orientated \n\/Intrinsic \nGood relationship with \ncolleagues \n70.3 Extrinsic \nGood holidays 69.9 Flexibility \nEasy to get job anywhere 66.7 Flexibility \nPromotion prospects 60.2 Extrinsic \nPositive image of school 52.8  \nFinancial incentives 48.4  \nSalary 45.9 Extrinsic \nCombine with parenthood 45.5 Flexibility \nStatus 32.1 Altruistic \nFamily approval 29.7  \n \nPrinciple components factor analysis was also carried out on this ratings data in order to \nidentify categories of motivation for teacher recruitment.  Five categories were identified; \nwhat we termed as intrinsic, altruistic, extrinsic, flexibility and children-orientated \nmotivations.  The identification of the first three categories was based on the teacher \nrecruitment literature.  The last two categories were identified through the component \nmotivations.  Although the children-orientated motivations were placed in a category on their \nown, the factor analysis showed that this category correlated quite highly with the altruistic \n 8 \n \nand intrinsic categories (correlations of around 0.6).  The motivations of \u2018Positive image of \nschool\u2019, \u2018Financial incentives\u2019 and \u2018Family approval\u2019 were not placed in any of the above \ngroups, having loadings of less than 0.4 on each of the categories. \nThe above results show that altruistic, intrinsic and children-orientated motivations \n(which itself is quite highly correlated with the first two categories) were identified as more \nimportant for entering teaching.  This was as opposed to extrinsic reasons such as \u2018Job \nsecurity\u2019, \u2018Promotion prospects\u2019 and \u2018Salary\u2019.  This was in agreement with the findings from \nthe literature review that identified altruistic and intrinsic reasons as being more important for \nteachers entering the profession. \nUsing the above ratings data, comparisons could be made between categories of \nteachers; firstly between female and male teachers, and secondly between those teaching in \nLondon and those teaching outside London.  Using Chi-square statistical analysis, comparing \nthe ratings for each of the possible motivations to enter teaching showed that female teachers \nwere significantly more likely to give higher ratings to \u2018Good relationship with colleagues\u2019 \nand \u2018Combine with parenthood\u2019.  Teachers in London rated \u2018Status\u2019 more highly, but rated \n\u2018Salary\u2019 significantly lower than their non-London colleagues.  Overall however, the pattern \nof intrinsic\/altruistic motivations being more important remained the case for each group of \nteachers. \nIn addition to rating possible motivations, teachers were also asked the more open-\nended question of \u2018Why did you go into teaching in the first place?\u2019  Teachers\u2019 responses to \nthis question were categorised (Table 2), and the number of teachers giving each category of \nreason were counted. Of course, a teacher could give more than one category of reason in \ntheir responses to this question. \nTable 2: Teachers reasons for entering teaching (response to open-ended question) \nReasons for entering teaching Number stating \nreason \nAlways had it in mind 80 \nEnjoyed previous experience\/had previous experience 47 \nUse degree\/Enjoyment of subject 43 \nWork with children\/young people\/people 38 \nJob satisfaction\/rewarding job\/interesting job\/creative\/enjoyment 32 \nFinancial considerations\/incentives 30 \nDislike previous job\/problem with previous job\/change of job 27 \nFits in with lifestyle\/family situation\/flexibility 24 \nAvailability of jobs\/Access to teaching available\/training available 21 \nFamily member\/friends a teacher 20 \nVariety in job\/Challenge 20 \nContribute to society\/benefit others 17 \nCareer progression (including Route to Ed Psych)\/wanted a profession 14 \nJob security 14 \nSuggestions from other people 14 \nThought could do the job 12 \nInspired by teachers\/experience of school 11 \nWanted to pass on subject\/experience to others 10 \nHolidays 8 \nWork in academic world\/school environment\/education\/not office \njob\/public sector 7 \nGet qualification\/continuation of learning 5 \nAdverts 3 \nNot sure of what to do 3 \n \n 9\n \nIn general, the results from the more open-ended question were in agreement with the \nprevious rating of motivations to enter teaching.  We can see from the above table that \u2018Use \ndegree\/Enjoyment of subject\u2019, \u2018Work with children\/young people\/people\u2019 and \u2018Job \nsatisfaction\/rewarding job\/interesting job\/creative\/enjoyment\u2019 were the more frequently given \nreasons in Table 2, similar to the three most highly rated reasons in Table 1.  However, the \nmore open-ended question also revealed two other important reasons for going into teaching.  \nThe two most frequently given reasons were that teachers had been considering a career in \nteaching for some time (\u2018Always had it in mind\u2019) and that they had positive previous \nexperiences of teaching.   \n \n \nReasons for not entering teaching \n \nTeachers in the study were also asked the open-ended question, \u2018Looking back, what factors \nmight have dissuaded you from entering teaching?\u2019  Once again categorising the responses \ngiven by teachers and counting the number of responses in each category, the following \nresults were obtained (Table 3). \n \nTable 3: Possible factors that might have dissuaded teachers from entering the \nprofession \nFactors Number stating factor \nPupil behaviour 57 \nWorkload\/Marking 56 \nSalary 39 \nCost of training 34 \nNothing 30 \nLong hours 21 \nStress 21 \nBureaucracy\/paperwork 19 \nImage of teaching\/media 13 \nOther people 10 \nFamily of teachers 9 \nConditions of work\/Lack of resources\/Large class sizes 8 \nFinances generally 8 \nMore study 7 \nWhether I could do it\/difficulty 7 \nApproach of the government 6 \nLack of qualifications 6 \nNot old enough 6 \nLack of support 5 \nLack of Status 4 \nSchool politics 4 \nAvailability of other jobs 2 \nLack of opportunity\/choice for training 2 \n \nThis time, in this open-ended question, teachers identified particular extrinsic factors that \ncould have impacted on their entry into teaching.  The most frequently stated factors were the \nissues of pupil behaviour and workload\/marking, followed by the financial considerations of \nsalary and cost of training.   \n \n \n 10 \n \nReasons for leaving teaching \n \nIn examining issues related to leaving teaching, teachers were first of all asked whether they \nwere considering leaving teaching within the next 10 years (Table 4). \n  \n 11\n \nTable 4: Whether teachers are considering leaving the profession in the next 10 years \nConsidering Leaving? Number of teachers % of teachers\nYes 66 26.8 \nNo 175 71.1 \nDon\u2019t know 5 2.0 \n \nWe found that 66 or 26.8% of the teachers sampled were considering leaving, and a further 5 \nor 2.0% did not know whether they would or not.  We asked this group of 71 teachers the \nopen-ended question of why they were considering leaving teaching.  We categorised their \nresponses as shown in Table 5 below and once again counted the number of response in each \ncategory. \n \nTable 5: Reasons given for why teachers were considering leaving teaching \nReasons Number giving reason\nWorkload\/marking 22 \nHave a family 18 \nStress\/exhaustion 17 \nPupil behaviour 14 \nTravelling\/gap year\/teach abroad 9 \nChange jobs\/do something different 8 \nAdmin\/paperwork 8 \nGovernment initiatives 6 \nLong hours 5 \nLack of status\/respect 4 \nSalary 4 \nFurther study 3 \nLack of resources 2 \nHad to move to different region 2 \nSchool management 2 \nLack of support 2 \nStaff politics 2 \nRetirement 2 \n \nWorkload\/marking was the most frequently cited reason, followed by having a family, stress \nand pupil behaviour.  Some of the reasons given did not preclude returning to teaching, for \nexample \u2018Have a family\u2019 and \u2018Travelling\/gap year\/teach abroad\u2019.  In fact when we asked \nthese 71 teachers whether they could envisage returning to teaching later on, 29 replied that \nthey could and a further 23 were uncertain either way as to whether they would (Table 6). \nTable 6: Whether teachers could envisage returning to teaching after leaving \nEnvisage returning? Number of teachers\nYes 29 \nPossibly\/Maybe\/Depends  20 \nDon\u2019t know 3 \nNo 15 \nNot clear from response 2 \n \nIn addition to the open-ended question summarised in Table 5, teachers were also asked to \nrate the importance of possible suggestions for persuading teachers generally to remain in the \nprofession.  Once again, the same four-point scale from the question in Table 1 was used.  \n 12 \n \nThe general phrasing of the question meant that all the teachers in the study were asked this \nquestion, not just those who were considering leaving.  Table 7 below summarises the results. \n \nTable 7: Teachers\u2019 ratings of the importance of possible suggestions to persuade \nteachers to remain in the profession \nSuggestion % responding \u2018quite important\u2019 \nor \u2018very important\u2019 \nCategory \nSupport on pupil discipline 94.3 Management \nReduce teacher workload 94.3 Workload \nBetter salary 91.5 Financial \nReduction in class sizes 89.8 Work conditions \nLess admin work for \nteachers \n89.4 Work \nconditions\/Workload \nTackle teacher stress 89.0 Workload \nImprove school facilities \nand resources \n88.2 Work conditions \nGreater recognition for \nwork done \n85.4 Society\u2019s view \nFinancial incentives to \nremain in teaching \n80.1 Financial \nImproving the way schools \nare managed \n76.4 Management \nSupport with housing 75.2 Financial \nImprove society's view of \nteachers \n74.0 Society\u2019s view \nLess government initiatives 70.6  \nGreater influence on school \npolicies \n64.6 Management \nHelp with child care 63.8 Flexibility \nImprove staff development 63.4 Management\/Flexibility \nImprove relationships with \nparents \n59.3 Management \nIncrease in number of \nclassroom assistants \n54.9 Work conditions \nBetter career prospects 53.3 Financial \nIntroduction of job-share \nschemes \n35.9 Flexibility \nSalaries based on \nperformance \n28.0  \n \nOnce again, principle component factor analysis was used to identify categories of \nsuggestions.  Based on the component suggestions, six categories were identified; School \nManagement, Workload, Work conditions, Financial, Society\u2019s view and Flexibility.  \nHowever, the suggestions \u2018Less government initiatives\u2019 and \u2018Salaries based on performance\u2019 \nhad loadings of less than 0.4 on these categories. \nTable 7 shows that the suggestions rated most highly by teachers were support on \npupil discipline and reducing teacher workload.  Once again, this was in agreement with the \nissues identified by the literature review as affecting teacher retention.  Workload\/marking \nwas also the most frequently stated reason given by those considering leaving in Table 5.  \nTherefore, these areas of workload and pupil discipline seem to be the areas that need to be \ntackled in order to impact on teacher wastage from the profession. \n 13\n \nInterestingly though, when we examined separately the ratings given to the above \nsuggestions for teachers from London and for those outside London, we found the largest \ndifferences in the ratings to be for \u2018Support with housing\u2019 and \u2018Help with child care\u2019 (Table \n8).  This seemed to be an indication of the relative difficulty faced by teachers in London with \nregards to these issues.  \nTable 8: Comparison of ratings for suggestions for improving retention given by \nTeachers in London and outside London \n% responding \u2018quite important\u2019 or \u2018very \nimportant\u2019 \nSuggestion London  Outside London Difference\nSupport on pupil discipline 88.3 96.2 -7.9 \nReduce teacher workload 93.3 94.6 -1.3 \nBetter salary 95.0 90.3 4.7 \nReduction in class sizes 88.3 90.3 -2.0 \nLess admin work for teachers 91.7 88.7 3.0 \nTackle teacher stress 86.4 89.8 -3.3 \nImprove school facilities and \nresources \n86.7 88.7 -2.0 \nGreater recognition for work \ndone \n91.7 83.3 8.3 \nFinancial incentives to remain in \nteaching \n84.7 78.5 6.3 \nImproving the way schools are \nmanaged \n76.7 76.3 0.3 \nSupport with housing 86.7 71.5 15.2 \nImprove society's view of \nteachers \n81.7 71.5 10.2 \nLess government initiatives 72.9 69.7 3.2 \nGreater influence on school \npolicies \n68.3 63.4 4.9 \nHelp with child care 73.3 60.8 12.6 \nImprove staff development 55.0 66.1 -11.1 \nImprove relationships with \nparents \n60.0 59.1 0.9 \nIncrease in number of classroom \nassistants \n51.7 55.9 -4.2 \nBetter career prospects 51.7 53.8 -2.1 \nIntroduction of job-share \nschemes \n35.0 36.2 -1.2 \nSalaries based on performance 31.7 26.9 4.8 \n \nAlso, it can be seen that teachers in London rated \u2018Better salary\u2019 as the most important \nsuggestion with \u2018Support on pupil discipline\u2019 less so.  Therefore, for the particular case of \nLondon, salary issues also need to be considered if we wish to improve retention. \n \n \nDiscussion of the results \n \nThe first part of our survey concentrated on factors that influenced the recruitment of \nteachers.  In examining the reasons given by teachers for entering the profession in the first \nplace, our results were in agreement with previous studies, highlighting altruistic or intrinsic \n 14 \n \nfactors, rather than extrinsic factors, as being the most important reasons.  The first six \npossible reasons that were rated as being the most important motivations to enter teaching \n(Table 1) were identified as children-orientated, intrinsic and altruistic in nature.  It is \ninteresting to note that in launching the \u2018Use your head: teach\u2019 advertising campaign in the \nnational media, the TTA identified the focus of the campaign as being job satisfaction, \nstimulation and interaction with young people to be derived from a career in teaching. \nHowever, in asking teachers the more open-ended question of \u2018Why did you go into \nteaching in the first place?\u2019, two other important reasons for entering teaching that had not \nbeen covered in our previous list of possible motivations were identified. Statements of the \nsort that they had \u2018always had it in mind\u2019 to enter the profession, and the influence of their \n\u2018previous experience\u2019 of teaching, were raised most often by teachers.   \n \n\u201cI probably fancied being a teacher ever since I was at school and always \nwanted to teach maths because people have always found it difficult and yet I \nfound it easy and was able to explain it to other people.\u201d \n \n\u201cIt really was just something I wanted to do.  I\u2019ve done quite a lot of voluntary \nwork and working with children and it was just something that I always wanted \nto do.\u201d \n \n\u201cI worked for a year in a further education college as a technician.  As my role \nin the college evolved, I got some teaching responsibilities which whetted my \nappetite, and I decided to do a PGCE on the back of that.\u201d \n \n\u201cI realised that actually the thing I enjoyed most about doing my Ph.D. up until \nthen had been working in the undergraduate lab and helping students there, and \nI decided to look into teaching a bit more.  I worked in a local sixth form centre \nas a researcher in residence for a while and really enjoyed it, so that really \nmade my mind up.  That was definitely what I wanted to do.\u201d \n \nHammond (2002), in his interviews with trainee teachers of ICT found that \u201cpositive \nexperiences of teaching or teacher-like activities in the past\u201d was the most frequently stated \ninfluence on trainees\u2019 decision to teach.  The past experience and perspective of teaching \ntherefore seems to be a significant motivation for people to enter teaching.  \nThe most striking findings emerging from the study however was the importance of \nworkload and pupil discipline on the attitudes of teachers.  The open-ended question asking \nwhat might dissuade teachers from entering the profession in the first place (Table 3) \nrevealed \u2018Pupil behaviour\u2019 and \u2018Workload\/Marking\u2019 as the two most frequently raised issues.  \nIn addition, when teachers were asked to rate the importance of possible suggestions to \nimprove teacher retention (Table 7), \u2018Support on pupil discipline\u2019 and \u2018Reduce teacher \nworkload\u2019 were once again rated the most important.   \nIf we are therefore wanting to impact on teacher numbers, then these two issues must \nbe seen to be tackled from the perspectives of the teachers.  We can draw on the comments of \nthe teachers from the study to back up this suggestion; \n \n \u201cI think the expectations of classroom teachers are so high and the attitude \nof children seem to me to be deteriorating really rapidly and that is \nbecoming a very big issue.  The stress caused by bad behaviour from \nchildren is a big factor and I\u2019m finding the children just don\u2019t want to \nlearn.\u201d \n \n\u201cI think we\u2019re mugs us teachers.  I think we\u2019re not respected by students and \nbehaviour is getting worse.  Something has to be done\u2026\u201d \n \n 15\n \n\u201cWorking 60 hours a week.  Not getting all my work done.  Becoming \nphysically ill as a result of it.  Not having any time to spend with my family.  \nSheer exhaustion.\u201d \n \nThis recommendation of tacking workload and pupil behaviour is in agreement with the \nsuggestions from other studies on recruitment and retention.  Smithers and Robinson (2001), \nin their interviews with 102 teachers that had resigned from the profession, found that reduced \nworkload, and improved pupil behaviour, as well as better salary, were most likely to tempt \nthe teachers back into the profession.  These inducements were again identified in a later \nstudy by Smithers and Robinson (2003), although the way the school is run was also \nidentified as a possible suggestion.   \nIn asking teachers to rate the impact of possible issues on recruitment and retention, \nwe recognise that what we may have done is to not take into account the complex \nrelationships between some of the issues, in particular involving workload and pupil \nbehaviour.  With regards to workload, teachers identified bureaucracy, paperwork and \nadministration tasks as exasperating the workload faced by them. \n \n\u201cI\u2019ve worked for the City Council so I know about paperwork and I know \nabout going up the right ladders.  But in school, there are times when I feel I \ndaren\u2019t breathe without having permission in triplicate.\u201d \n \n\u201cThe workload I expected but the amount of what I consider to be trivial \npaperwork and dotting i's and crossing t\u2019s that I think is a complete waste of \ntime.\u201d \n   \nTherefore, tacking these related issues is one way that the problem of workload could be \nreduced for teachers.  In this way, other issues such as the stress and pressure felt by teachers \ncould be reduced. \n \n\u201cAt the moment, workload and pupil behaviour are factors and the general \nstress that goes with these two.\u201d \n \n\u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of colleagues that I work with who are suffering under the \nstrain of the workload and the pupil behaviour\u2026\u201d \n \n\u201cI\u2019m really down about the fact that I have to go and put myself through \ncertain classes.  I\u2019m not prepared to accept that for more than a few \nyears\u2026\u201d \n \nOther comments from teachers highlighted the importance of the support from Senior \nManagement or from government in tackling these problems.  A perceived lack of support in \nthese areas can again exasperate the problems of discipline and workload. \n \n\u201cThe workload, I don\u2019t consider that it\u2019s very sociable \u2026 Discipline in \nschools and the lack of support from Senior Management \u2026 I am not a very \nnice person any more.  I used to be.  I used to laugh a lot but at the moment, \nI\u2019m just not.  I\u2019m constantly tired.  After having all day of children saying \n\u2018Miss, Miss, Miss\u2019, the last thing I want is to come home and have people go \n\u2018Mum, Mum, Mum\u2019.  I think I\u2019m frazzled.\u201d \n \n\u201cThey said they\u2019ve brought in this national workload agreement \u2026 It has \nmade no difference to me whatsoever and I think it\u2019s just a gimmick, and I \nthink the teaching profession is full of gimmicks and I\u2019m getting fed up of \ngimmicks really\u2026 It hasn\u2019t been implemented properly.  I\u2019m told by me \n 16 \n \nHead that they haven\u2019t been given the money to implement it so there is an \nexpectation placed on teachers.\u201d \n \nPupil behaviour and workload are therefore the two main issues that this study has \nidentified in order to improve the areas of teacher recruitment and retention.  However, it also \ninteresting to consider the importance of teachers\u2019 salaries on these areas.  Other than \nbehaviour and workload, pay was the next important factor identified by teachers as \nencouraging recruitment (Table 3). Also, it was the fifth most important factor (behind class \nsizes and reducing admin, both of which could be directly related to behaviour and workload) \nin encouraging the retention of teachers (Table 7).  Therefore, although pay was not seen to \nbe as important generally as behaviour and workload, it still needs to be considered when \ntrying to impact on recruitment and retention. From some of the teachers\u2019 comments, teacher \npay may be important because of the difficulties faced by teachers with discipline and \nworkload. \n \n\u201cI think I am working 70 hour weeks.  I could be earning a lot more in the \ncity.\u201d \n \n\u201cI work harder now for half the money that I used to earn, with more hassle, \nmore paperwork, more workload than I did when I was in private industry, \nand it consumes my evenings, my weekends, my supposed free time\u2026\u201d \n \nHowever, another important finding of the study was the fact the salary was seen by teachers \nin London specifically as being the most important issue in improving retention.   This is in \nagreement with the findings of Hutchings et al. (2000) who found pay to be the most \nimportant inducement to return to teaching.  Therefore, because of the particular difficulties \nfor teacher numbers in London, then pay needs to be considered alongside pupil behaviour \nand workload as areas that we need to focus upon to improve recruitment and retention. \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn this study, we have examined the views of teachers of shortage subjects in England and \nWales, with regards to their views on what factors influence teacher recruitment and \nretention.  For the case of teachers in London, salary emerged as an important influence.  \nHowever, more generally for teachers in England and Wales, the issues that have emerged as \nimportant both from our quantitative and qualitative findings are those of pupil behaviour and \nworkload.  We have seen that these were perceived to be the most important in possibly \ndissuading teachers from entering the profession, and also, through tackling these issues, in \npersuade teachers to remain in the profession. These finding were in agreement with those of \nother recent studies, providing further support of the importance of these issues with regards \nto teacher recruitment and retention. \nTherefore, from our study, we put forward the recommendation that in order to \nimpact on the numbers of teachers of shortage subjects in England and Wales, then policy \nmakers must tackle these issues in order to improve the recruitment and retention in these \nsubjects.  Indeed, from 2005, the UK Government has put in place in English and Welsh \nschools the Workload Agreement, designed to reduce teachers\u2019 overall hours and to cut down \non the administrative work carried out by teachers.  It is hoped that this agreement is fully \nimplemented so that workload is no longer see as such a problems by teachers.  In turn, it is \nhoped that pupil behaviour is focused upon in the same way.  It will be of interest to see \nwhether such improvements do have a direct impact on teacher recruitment and retention \nfigures in the coming years and whether teachers\u2019 perceptions change with regards to these \nparticular issues. \n 17\n \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThe author would like to thank the DfES for funding the original study which produced these \nresults. \n \n \nReferences \n \nBarmby, P. and Coe, R.
