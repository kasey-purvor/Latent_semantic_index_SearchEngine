Conclusion MPO and NT-BNP may be useful tools for risk \nstratification of all acute coronary syndromes, including higher risk STEMI patients. \n \n \nKeywords Myocardial infarction; peptides, myeloperoxidase, prognosis  \n \n  \n 3\nIntroduction \nInflammatory mechanisms play a central role in atherosclerosis.1 Acute myocardial \ninfarction (AMI) occurs when an underlying atherosclerotic plaque ruptures leading to \nthrombus formation and occlusion of a coronary vessel.2 As our understanding of this \nprocess has increased the importance of the leucocyte as being pivotal in this process \nhas also increased.3 Indeed the association of the leucocyte with the extent of \ncoronary artery disease has been known for some years.4 The importance of the white \ncell enzymes however is only recently being investigated. One such enzyme is \nmyeloperoxidase (MPO) which is present in the granules of the leucocyte.5 \nImmunohistochemical studies have demonstrated the presence of MPO in \natheromatous plaques.6 MPO can also activate metalloproteinases and inactivate \nplasminogen activator inhibitor, promoting destabilization and rupture of the \natherosclerotic plaque surface.7 Furthermore, MPO catalytically consumes \nendothelium-derived nitric oxide, thereby reducing nitric oxide bioavailability, \nleading to vasoconstriction5 and endothelial dysfunction.8  \nIndeed MPO is emerging as a useful marker for prognostication in a variety of clinical \nsettings. Recently it was shown to be of prognostic value in patients presenting with \nchest pain to the emergency room9 and there is also association between \nmyeloperoxidase levels and risk of coronary artery disease.10 The inflammation in \nacute coronary syndromes is thought to be widespread.11 Its role however in the \nprognostication of AMI is unknown. In this study we investigated whether MPO \nwould be of benefit in determining the prognosis of AMI, particularly death and \nreinfarction which remain a leading cause of mortality and morbidity. We compared \nthis with N terminal pro B type natriuretic peptide (NT-BNP) which has been shown \nto be of prognostic benefit in this group of patients. 12\n  \n 4\nMethods \nStudy population \nWe studied 384 consecutive post ST segment elevation myocardial infarction \n(STEMI) patient who were admitted to the Coronary Care Unit of Leicester Royal \nInfirmary. The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki, was approved by the \nlocal ethics committee and written informed consent was obtained from patients. \nMyocardial infarction (MI) was diagnosed if a patient had chest pain lasting >20 \nminutes, diagnostic serial electrocardiographic (ECG) changes consisting of new \npathological Q waves or ST-segment elevation changes, and a plasma creatine kinase-\nMB elevation greater than twice normal or cardiac troponin I level >0.1 ng\/mL.13 \nExclusion criteria were known malignancy, or surgery in the previous month.  \nPatients with ST-segment elevation of >0.1 mV in two contiguous ECG leads \nreceived thrombolytic therapy (tissue plasminogen activator or streptokinase) if they \npresented within a suitable time frame. Control subjects were age and gender matched \nand recruited from University of Leicester and had peptide measurements made once. \n \nPlasma samples \nSerial blood measurements were made at 0-24, 25-48, 49-72, 73-96, 97-120 hr after \nonset of chest pain for determination of plasma MPO and NT-BNP. A single median \nvalue over the 5 days was used in analysis. After 15 minutes bed rest, 20mL blood \nwas collected into tubes containing EDTA and aprotinin. All plasma was stored at -\n70\u00b0C until assayed in a single batch. \n \n \n \n  \n 5\nEchocardiography \nTransthoracic echocardiography was performed in patients using a Sonos 5500 \ninstrument (Philips Medical Systems, Reigate, UK). A 16-segment left ventricular \nwall motion index (LVWMI) based on the American Society of Echocardiography \nmodel13  was derived by scoring each LV segment (1=normal, 2=hypokinesis, \n3=akinesis and 4=dyskinesis (Paradoxical Motion), and dividing the total by the \nnumber of segments scored. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was calculated \nusing the biplane method of discs formula. 14\n \nNT-BNP assay \nOur NT-BNP assay was based on a non-competitive assay. 15Sheep antibodies were \nraised to the N-terminal of human NT-BNP and monoclonal mouse antibodies were \nraised to the C- terminal. The N-terminal IgG was affinity-purified and biotinylated. \nSamples or NT-BNP standards were incubated in C-terminal IgG\u2013coated wells with \nthe biotinylated antibody for 24 hours at 4\u00b0C. Detection was with methyl-acridinium \nester (MAE)\u2013labelled streptavidin.15 The lower limit of detection was 0.3 fmol\/ml. \nThere was no cross reactivity with atrial natriuretic peptide, BNP, or C-type \nnatriuretic peptide. The results from this in-house assay are highly correlated (r=0.90, \nP<0.0001, n=86) to those obtained on the NTproBNP assay marketed by Roche \nDiagnostics Ltd. (Lewes, East Sussex, UK). \n \nMPO assay \nThe MPO assay was based on a non-competitive assay. Capture antibody was 100ng \nof a monoclonal anti-MPO (Research Diagnostics Inc., Flanders, NJ) coated onto \nELISA plates, and detection was with a rabbit anti-MPO antibody (Merck Biosciences \n  \n 6\nLtd., Nottingham, UK). Samples or MPO standards were incubated for 24 hours at \n4\u00b0C. Following washes, detection was performed using sequential incubations with \nbiotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG and methyl-acridinium ester (MAE)\u2013labelled \nstreptavidin.15 Intra and inter-assay coefficients of variation which were found to be \nless than 10%. \n \nEnd points \nWe assessed the value of both MPO and NT-BNP for the prediction of mortality. We \nused a combined primary endpoint consisting of death and non-fatal MI and also \ninvestigated death and non-fatal MI as individual secondary endpoints. \nHospitalisation for AMI was defined as above. We also investigated the secondary \nendpoint of heart failure. Hospitalization for heart failure was defined as a hospital \nadmission for which heart failure was the primary reason. Endpoints were obtained by \nreviewing the Office of National Statistics Registry, and by contacting each patient. \nThere was a minimum 30-day follow-up of all patients. \n \nStatistical analysis \nStatistical analyses were performed on SPSS Version 12 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, \nIllinois). The continuous variables in the two independent groups were compared \nusing the Mann Whitney U test. Spearman\u2019s correlations were performed and Cox \nproportional hazards analyses were conducted which included baseline patient \ncharacteristics (age, sex, serum creatinine, Killip class, territory of AMI, LVWMI and \nwhether the patient received thrombolysis or not) and peptide markers (including \ntroponin I), to test the independent predictive power of the peptides above and below \nthe median for death or non-fatal MI as defined above. NT-BNP and MPO were \n  \n 7\nnormalised by log transformation. Thus hazard ratios refer to a tenfold rise in the \nlevels of these markers. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated to visualise the \nrelationship between the peptides NT-BNP and MPO and the composite endpoints. To \ncompare the predictive value of NT-BNP and MPO, receiver-operating characteristic \n(ROC) curves were generated and the area under the curves (AUC) was calculated. A \np value below 0.05 was deemed to be statistically significant. Power calculations \nsuggest that 318 patients recruited over 24 months and a follow-up period of at least 1 \nmonth, with median survival probabilities of 0.8 or 0.7 at 12 months in the groups \nstratified by the biomarker median, would enable the hypothesis to be tested with a \npower of 95% at P<0.01 (2-sided test). We recruited 20% more patients in case \nfollow-up was incomplete in some cases. \n \nResults \nPatient characteristics \nThe demographic features of the patient population separated into quartiles are shown \nin Table 1. There were 257 controls (132 male), age 61.8 \u00b1 14.3. Median length of \nfollow-up was 330 days with a range of 0\u2013644 days (0 was due to death) . Of the \npatients enrolled, 70.8 % received thrombolysis during the index admission. No \npatient was lost to follow-up. During follow-up, 40 (10.4%) patients died 37 (9.6%) \nwere readmitted with AMI and there were 23 (6.0%) readmissions with heart failure. \nEchocardiographic data was available for 334 (87.0%) of the 384 patients and \nperformed at a median of 3.5 days (range 2-5) after presentation with AMI. 39 \nechocardiograms were unanalysable (due to off axis apical views, and\/or poor image \nquality) and 11 patients did not receive an echocardiogram. \n \n  \n 8\nMPO levels in patients and controls \nPlasma levels of MPO in patients with AMI ranged from 4.0- 405.2 ng\/ml. Median \nlevel over the 5 days was 35.9 ng\/ml, 25th and 75th centile 18.0 and 61.2ng\/ml. These \nlevels were significantly higher than those observed in the control subjects (median \n26.7 ng\/ml range 8.0-79.0 ng\/ml p<0.005). Plasma median MPO was raised in \npatients experiencing the primary endpoint of death or MI compared to survivors \nwithout recurrent MI (median [range] ng\/ml, 50.6[15.3-124.1] vs. 34.5[6.6-400.2], \np=0.001). The time course of secretion of MPO revealed a significant difference over \nthe 5 days (p<0.0001) and is shown in figure 1.  \nAlthough MPO levels in the first 48 hrs after an AMI weakly correlated with peak \ntroponin I levels (r= 0.183, p=0.025), this was not true for the later plasma levels (r= \n0.109, p=0.179). There was no correlation of MPO with age (r= -0.04, p> 0.247), \nLVWMI (r= 0.131, p> 0.147) or presentation neutrophil count (r= 0.089, p> 0.307), \nMPO did not differ significantly according to gender, smoking status, the presence or \nabsence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, previous MI diagnosis, \nhypercholesterolemia or whether a patient received thrombolyis or not. There was no \ncorrelation however between NT-BNP and MPO (r=0.068, p=0.401). \n \nNT-BNP levels in patients and controls \nNT-BNP was significantly elevated in AMI compared with controls (Median [Range], \nfmol\/ml, 1459.94; [0.3\u201311779.03] vs. 10.1; [0.3\u2013 134.4]; p<0.001) and was \nsignificantly higher in patients who died (5815.86; [20.1\u201311269.92] vs. 767.6; [0.30\u2013 \n11779.03]; p<0.001) or reinfarcted in the first 72 hours (1271.104; [2.64\u2013 11779.03] \nvs. 767.6; [0.30\u201311779.03]; p=0.031). The time course of secretion of NT-BNP \nrevealed a significant difference over the 5 days (p<0.0001) and is shown in figure 2. \n  \n 9\nRelationship between MPO and echocardiographic parameters \nFor the whole population, mean LVWMI was 1.53 (range 1.08-2.83) and EF was 36% \n(range 8-49%). The LVWMI score in those subjects with anterior AMI was higher \nthan in those with inferior AMI (1.8 [1.08-2.75] vs. 1.4 [1.00-2.83], p<0.001) and \nLVEF was lower in anterior AMI than inferior AMI (37 [8-48] vs. 40.1 [14-49]) %, \np=0.05). There was no correlation of MPO with LVWMI (r= 0.104, p> 0.147). \nHowever NT-BNP correlated with LVWMI (r=0.434, p<0.0001) at all time points.  \n \nMPO and NT-BNP as predictors of death or non-fatal MI \nWhen clinical and demographic characteristics (age, sex, serum creatinine, Killip \nclass, territory of AMI, LVWMI, whether the patient received thrombolysis or not, \ntroponin I, MPO and NT-BNP) entered into a Cox proportional hazards model the \nindependent predictors of the primary endpoint were log median MPO (HR 6.91, 95% \nCI: 1.79-26.73, p=0.005) and log median NT-BNP (HR 4.21, 95% CI: 1.53-11.58, \np=0.005, table 2) The Kaplan-Meier survival curve revealed a significantly better \nclinical outcome in patients with median MPO below the median compared with those \nwith median MPO above the median (log rank 12.62, p=0.0004, figure 3); this was \nalso true for NT-BNP (log rank 20.24, p<0.0001, figure 4). MPO had predictive \npower in patients with NT-BNP levels below or above the median (log rank 5.60, \np=0.020, log rank 5.12, p=0.024 respectively).  In addition there was a grading to the \nprimary endpoint, which increased as the levels of MPO or NT-BNP increased. A \npositive MPO and NT-BNP (i.e. both above their respective median values) was \nassociated with a significantly higher rate of the primary endpoint than having either \npeptide level above their medians, or both peptides below their medians (log rank \n30.73, p <0.00001, figure 5). When patients were examined for one or more raised \n  \n 10\nMPO or NT-BNP peptide levels the receiver-operating curve for median NT-BNP \nyielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.65-0.79, p<0.001); for \nmedian MPO the AUC was 0.62 (95% CI: 0.55-0.69, p=0.001). The logistic model \ncombining the 2 markers yielded an AUC of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.69-0.82, p<0.001) \nwhich exceeded that of either peptide alone (figure 6). Discharge MPO and NT-BNP \nwas better at predicting death or non-fatal MI than admission measurements \n(discharge AUC for MPO 0.62, p=0.05, for NT-BNP 0.66, p=0.013 vs. admission \nAUC for MPO 0.56, p>0.05, for NT-BNP 0.69, p<0.001). \n \nSecondary endpoints: MPO and NT-BNP as predictors of death  \nPlasma median MPO was raised in patients experiencing death compared to survivors \n(median [range] ng\/ml, 43.4[8.1-132.1] vs. 34.5[6.6-400.2], p=0.011). This was also \ntrue for median NT-BNP (median [range] fmol\/ml, 5755.1[10.3-10552.8] vs. \n1099.2[2.43-9570.6.], p<0.0001).  \nOn the Cox proportional hazards model the only independent predictor of death was \nlog median NT-BNP (HR 2.993, 95% CI: 1.171-7.655, p=0.022). \nThe Kaplan-Meier survival curve revealed a significantly better clinical outcome in \npatients with median NT-BNP below the median compared with those with median \nNT-BNP above the median (log rank 11.47, p=0.0007, graph not shown).  A positive \nMPO and NT-BNP was associated with a significantly higher rate of the death than \nhaving one raised peptide level or two low levels of peptide (log rank 22.63, p \n<0.00001). \nSecondary endpoints: MPO and NT-BNP as predictors of non-fatal MI \nPlasma median MPO was no different in patients experiencing non-fatal MI compared \nto survivors (median [range] ng\/ml, 44.7[8.1-105.6] vs. 34.5[6.6-400.2], p=0.091). \n  \n 11\nThis was also true for median NT-BNP (median [range] fmol\/ml, 2219.7[2.6-9316.3] \nvs. 1180.0[2.43-10552.8], p=0.119). Multivariate statistics did not reveal any \nsignificant differences; however the Kaplan-Meier curve showed that a positive MPO \nand NT-BNP was associated with a significantly higher rate of non-fatal MI than \nhaving one raised peptide level or two low levels of peptide (log rank 7.46, p =0.006). \n \nSecondary endpoints: MPO and NT-BNP as predictor of heart failure \nPlasma median MPO was no different in patients who were readmitted with heart \nfailure compared to survivors who were not admitted (median [range] ng\/ml, \n46.6[6.8-84.7] vs. 35.1[6.6-400.2], p=0.244). Plasma median NT-BNP was \nsignificantly higher in those readmitted with heart failure compared to survivors who \nwere not admitted (median [range] fmol\/ml, 3622.4[2.4-9053.1] vs. 1180.0[2.6-\n10552.8], p=0.002). In a Cox proportional hazards model however only age (HR 1.04, \np=0.09), Killip class (HR 2.39, p=0.08) and past history of MI (HR 3.37, p=0.007), \nwere found to be independent predictors of heart failure. \n \nDiscussion \nThe aim of this study was to assess the utility of MPO and NT-BNP in determining \nthe prognosis of AMI patients. The results of this study confirm the independent \nprognostic value of MPO and NT-BNP in determining death or non-fatal MI in \npatients who have an acute ST-segment elevation MI. The predictive value of MPO \nprovides risk prediction independent of NT-BNP and other known clinical predictors \nof death or non-fatal MI. Our study showed only weak correlation between MPO and \npeak troponin I and no correlation between MPO and LVWMI, reiterating the fact \nthat MPO is not a marker of myocardial necrosis. Recruitment and degranulation of \n  \n 12\nthe neutrophil leading to the release of MPO is seen as a key step in AMI.16 Both \nMPO and NT-BNP are raised after an AMI and their secretion patterns differ over the \n5 days following an AMI with significant differences noted for both peptides. It is \nclear that MPO is raised very early after an AMI with levels falling rapidly after the \nfirst 24 hours suggesting that neutrophil activation plays a role very early in AMI and \nmay even precede the onset of AMI.  \nReperfusion therapy has improved mortality post MI, however the outcome of \npatients despite this is still poor;17 for this reason risk stratification remains important \nand may be useful to select treatment regimes in the future.  \nWe used MPO, an inflammatory marker from the leucoctye and NT-BNP which is a \nmore stable by-product in the production of BNP.18 We have clearly shown the \nbenefit of using each peptide alone at predicting death or MI.  In addition MPO had \npredictive power even in the patients with NT-BNP levels above the median, \nsuggesting that further risk stratification of this high-risk group is possible. \nFurthermore a positive MPO and NT-BNP was associated with a significantly higher \nrate of the primary endpoint than having one raised peptide level or two low levels of \npeptides. Using a combination of MPO and NT-BNP in a multi-marker risk \nstratification approach in STEMI patients gives an increased area under the ROC \ncurve and more predictive power.  The utility of MPO as a prognostic marker has \nbeen borne out previously in patients with acute coronary syndromes19 where it was \nfound to be an independent predictor of death or non-fatal MI in this population \ngroup. In another study the usefulness of MPO in patients presenting to the \nemergency room with chest pain was examined.9 Here it was found to be useful as an \nindependent predictor of early MI and major adverse cardiac events in the ensuing 30 \ndays and at 6 months. Brennan et al study recruited all patients presenting with chest \n  \n 13\npain and the study included 23.5% of patients with a final diagnosis of AMI; in \ncomparison our study has examined only patients with a diagnosis of STEMI, a \nrelatively high-risk group.  \nIn univariate analysis both MPO and NT-BNP were significantly raised in patients \nwho subsequently died compared to survivors. However on multivariate analysis NT-\nBNP retained independent prognostic information but not MPO. This concurs with \nprevious studies on the utility of NT-BNP in predicting death.20, 21 However neither \npeptide marker had utility in predicting non-fatal MI in univariate or multivariate \nanalysis. One of the limitations of this study and the reason why the secondary \nendpoints of death and MI did not achieve statistical significance may well have been \ndue to the number of patients recruited. A larger study may be appropriate to detect \nthe utility of this combination of markers in predicting death and MI individually. The \nre-infarction rate is also high and this may be due in part to the fact that reperfusion \nwas obtained with thrombolysis. Care must be taken to extrapolate these findings in \npatients undergoing mechanical reperfusion. \nPrevious multimarker strategies have used combinations of markers including, \ninflammatory markers, myocardial necrosis markers and markers of left ventricular \nsystolic dysfunction22 in formulating a risk assessment profile in Non-STEMI \npatients. This is the first study however reporting the utility of MPO in combination \nwith NT-BNP in patients with STEMI.  \nIn conclusion, the present study reveals that MPO is a predictor of death or non-fatal \nMI in patients with STEMI. This study confirms previous findings that MPO is \ninvolved during an AMI and it may be useful in a multimarker approach with NT-\nBNP for risk stratification in STEMI patients. MPO and NT-BNP may be useful tools \n  \n 14\nfor risk stratification of all acute coronary syndromes, including higher risk STEMI \npatients. \n \nAcknowledgments \nDr Sohail Q Khan is supported by a British Heart Foundation Junior Research \nFellowship (FS\/03\/028\/15486).
