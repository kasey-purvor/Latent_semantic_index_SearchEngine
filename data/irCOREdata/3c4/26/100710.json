The cross-section upper limits for the 10Be(14C,6He 6He)12C and\n10Be(14C,\u03b1 8He)12C reactions are 50 and 300 nb respectively.\nDOI: 10.1103\/PhysRevC.73.057301 PACS number(s): 23.60.+e, 23.70.+j, 25.60.\u2212t, 27.20.+n\nIn recent years a number of experiments have been\nperformed to study the 6He + 6He molecular nature of 12Be\n[1\u20134]. The first employed a 31.5 MeV\/nucleon 12Be beam\nto study the p(12Be,6He 6He)p reaction [1,2]. A number of\ndiscrete states were observed in 12Be, and a study of the 6He +\n6He fragment angular correlations allowed several tentative\nspin assignments to be made. The energy\/spin systematics for\nthe states indicate that a highly deformed rotational structure\nwas populated in the reaction. The gradient of the rotational\nband (150 \u00b1 40) keV, is consistent with that calculated for two\ntouching 6He nuclei in a molecular configuration (165 keV\nwith r0 = 1.3 fm) and very much lower than that predicted\nfor a spherical 12Be nucleus (360 keV). This work therefore\nprovided evidence for a deformed 6He + 6He cluster structure\nin 12Be, possibly linked to an \u03b1-4n-\u03b1 molecule. More recently\na 75 MeV\/nucleon 14Be beam and 12C target was used [3] to\nstudy two neutron removal and provided evidence for a new\nstate in 12Be at 11.8 MeV for which a tentative spin assignment\nof 0+ was made. This state appears to lie on the rotational band\nobserved in Refs. [1,2], and was proposed as a band-head\nmember of the 6He + 6He molecular band. In Ref. [4] a 60\nMeV\/nucleon 12Be beam and a liquid helium target were used\nto study the 4He(12Be,6He 6He)4He reaction. Two new states\nwere reported at 10.9 and 11.3 MeV with spin assignments of\n0+ and 2+, respectively. These again appear to lie on the same\nrotational band as the previous states observed in Refs. [1\u20133].\nIn order to study the 6He + 6He and \u03b1 + 8He decay of 12Be\na measurement of the 10Be(14C,12Be\u2217)12C reaction has been\nperformed. The 14C beam, available at higher intensity than a\nsecondary fragmentation beam and with greater beam quality,\nshould, in principle, allow a high resolution study of the 12Be\nrotational band and provide sufficient statistics to allow firm\nspin assignments to be made. In addition, data on the \u03b1 + 6He\ndecay of 10Be was also collected.\nThe experiment was performed at the Florida State Uni-\nversity superconducting LINAC facility. The 14C beam was\naccelerated to \u223c90 MeV, the exact beam energy being\n\u2217E-mail: N.Curtis@bham.ac.uk\ndetermined later during the offline data analysis (see below).\nThe beam was not debunched following LINAC acceleration\nresulting in a beam energy spread of \u223c800 keV. The integrated\nbeam exposure was 0.44 mC. The reaction target, 280 \u00b5g\/cm2\nBeO, was mounted on a 1.0 mg\/cm2 Pt backing for mechanical\nsupport. The 10Be enrichment was \u223c94% [5] and the total 10Be\nthickness \u223c100 \u00b5g\/cm2. The target was orientated with the Pt\nbacking upstream and the BeO facing the detectors.\nThe He decay fragments were detected in coincidence in\nan array of two (50 mm \u00d7 50 mm) detector telescopes. The\nfirst element in each telescope was a 65 \u00b5m thick silicon\ndouble sided strip detector (DSSD) used for energy loss\n(\u0002E) measurements. Each DSSD was segmented into 32\nindependent (50 mm \u00d7 3 mm) strips, with 16 horizontal\nstrips on the front face and 16 vertical strips on the back\nface. The second element was a 500 \u00b5m thick silicon resistive\nstrip detector (RSD). This was segmented into 16 independent\nhorizontal (50 mm \u00d7 3 mm) strips which were aligned with\nthose on the front face of the DSSD detectors. Resistive charge\ndivision provided position information along the strip length\nwith a resolution of \u223c0.3 mm. The vertical position resolution,\n\u00b11.5 mm, was limited by the strip pitch. The energy resolution\nfor 6.118 MeV \u03b1-particles obtained from a 252Cf source was\n115 keV. The third element in each telescope was a 10 mm\nthick CsI scintillator, used to stop energetic particles that\npassed through both silicon detectors. In combination the three\ndetectors provided energy and position information as well as\nparticle identification for all isotopes from 1H to 7Li. The two\ntelescopes were positioned horizontally either side of the beam\naxis at center angles of 17\u25e6 and at a target to RSD distance of\n140 mm. In order to shield the detectors from beam particles\nelastically scattered from the Pt backing of the target 250 \u00b5m\nmylar sheets were placed in front of each telescope. These\nstopped the 14C beam nuclei but allowed the He decay products\nto pass through to the detectors. The telescopes were calibrated\nusing 241Am, 244Cm and 252Cf \u03b1-particle sources and 23.9 and\n42.5 MeV 12C beams scattered from Au and C targets. Data\nwere taken with the mylar absorbers both in place and removed\nto allow a determination of the thickness via a consideration\nof particle energy loss. The mylar thickness obtained by this\nmethod was (255 \u00b1 5) \u00b5m, consistent with the (258 \u00b1 6) \u00b5m\nmeasured using a micrometer.\n0556-2813\/2006\/73(5)\/057301(4) 057301-1 \u00a92006 The American Physical Society\nBRIEF REPORTS PHYSICAL REVIEW C 73, 057301 (2006)\nFIG. 1. (Color online) PI spectrum obtained using the DSSD and\nRSD detectors of a telescope. In the inset a PI using the RSD and CsI\nenergies is shown.\nThe He fragments arising from the decay of excited states\nin Be were identified using the \u0002E-E information provided by\nthe detector telescopes. Figure 1 shows a particle identification\n(PI) spectrum obtained using the DSSD (\u0002E) and RSD (E)\ndetectors of one telescope. The isotopes 1,2,3H, 4,6He and 6,7Li\nare observed. There is little, if any, evidence, for 8He. In the\ninset to Fig. 1 a second PI spectrum, obtained using the RSD\nenergy (\u0002E) and the CsI energy (E), is shown. These events\ncorrespond to those in which highly energetic particles, with\nsufficient energy to pass through both of the silicon detectors,\nwere incident on the telescope. The isotopes 1,2,3H and 4He\nare clearly observed in this spectrum.\nAfter PI selection a Q-value spectrum was produced for\neach reaction by summing the energy of the two detected\nfragments (E1 and E2) with that of the undetected recoil (Erec).\nThe total energy (Etot) in the exit channel, E1 + E2 + Erec,\nis equal to the sum of the beam energy and the three body\nQ-value for the reaction, Ebeam + Q3 [6]. The recoil energy\nwas determined from the missing momentum between the\nbeam and two detected particles and by making an assumption\nof the recoil mass. In Fig. 2 the Etot spectrum for the\n10Be(14C,\u03b1 6He)14C reaction is shown. The peak labeled Qggg\ncorresponds to events in which all three final state particles\nwere emitted in the ground state. The centroid energy of\nthis peak was used to determine the exact beam energy\nprovided by the LINAC. The reconstructed position of the peak\n(E1 + E2 + Erec) will only coincide with the predicted energy\n(Ebeam + Q3) if the beam energy used in the reconstruction\nis correct. By reconstructing the Etot spectrum for a number\nof different beam energies and comparing the measured and\npredicted Qggg peak positions the beam energy at the center of\nthe target was determined to be 87.7 MeV. After considering\nthe energy loss in the target the energy from the LINAC\nwas found to be 88.5 MeV. For the 10Be(14C,\u03b1 6He)14C\nreaction Q3 = \u22127.41 MeV. The Qggg peak therefore appears\nat Etot = 80.28 MeV. The peak labeled Qgg(1), at Etot =\n73.42 MeV, is 6.86 MeV lower than the Qggg peak.

There is also evidence for a third peak in Fig. 2,\nlabeled Qgg(2). This appears at an energy of 69.9 MeV,\n10.4 MeV lower than the Qggg peak. Again this corresponds to\nthe 10Be(14C,\u03b1 6He)14C\u2217 channel, with the 14C\u2217 being excited\nto the 9.746 MeV 0+, 9.801 MeV 3\u2212, 10.425 MeV 2+,\n10.449 MeV \u00011, 10.498 MeV (3\u2212) or 10.736 MeV 4+ excited\nstate [7].\nIn order to confirm the peaks seen in the Etot spectrum arise\nfrom reactions with the 10Be content of the target, and not the\n16O or Pt components, a plot of the recoil energy determined\nfrom energy conservation (Erec \u2212 Q3 = Ebeam \u2212 E1 \u2212 E2)\n(in MeV) plotted against that determined from momentum\nconservation (Erec = p2rec\/2) (in MeVu, where u is the atomic\nmass unit) was produced (Fig. 3). As the recoil energy is\ncorrectly given by Erec = p2rec\/2mrecQggg events will appear\nin the spectrum as a locus with a slope given by 1\/mrec\nand an intercept on the Erec \u2212 Q3 axis equal to \u2212Q3. In\nFig. 3 the Qggg events from the 10Be(14C,\u03b1 6He)14C reaction\nlie on a line with a slope of 1\/14 and an intercept equal\nto \u2212Q3 = 7.41 MeV. The solid line indicates the predicted\nlocation of these events. The dashed line indicates events from\nthe 10Be(14C,\u03b1 6He)14C\u2217 reaction, where the 14C recoil has\nbeen assumed to be excited to the 6.589 MeV 0+ state. The\nslope is again 1\/14 and the intercept is equal to the sum of\n\u2212Q3 and the 14C excitation energy. The predicted locus for\nthe 16O(14C,\u03b1 6He)20Ne channel is given by the dotted line.\nThere are a number of possible Pt loci, the most abundant\nmasses being 194, 195, 196 and 198 (32.9, 33.8, 25.3 and\n7.2% natural abundance respectively). For clarity only the\nlocus for the 195Pt(14C,\u03b1 6He)199Hg reaction is shown (dot-\ndash line). The other Pt lines have almost identical slopes and\nthe variation in Q3 (and hence intercept) is only 1.25 MeV.\nIt is clear from Fig. 3 that the data are best described by the\n057301-2\nBRIEF REPORTS PHYSICAL REVIEW C 73, 057301 (2006)\n10Be(14C,\u03b1 6He)14C\nErec =  prec\n2 \/2 (MeVu)\n0 40 80 120 160 200 240\n\u201310\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nE r\ne\nc \n\u2013\n \nQ 3\n \n=\n \nE b\nea\nm\n \n\u2013\n \nE 1\n \n\u2013\n \nE 2\n \n(M\neV\n)\nFIG. 3.

These\nspectra are therefore not shown.\nThe 10Be excitation energy (Ex) in the 10Be(14C,\u03b1 6He)14C\nchannel was determined from the relative energy (Erel)\nbetween the detected \u03b1 and 6He decay products (Ex = Erel \u2212\nQ2, where Q2 is the breakup Q-value) [6]. As the 10Be decay\nis not affected by any excitation energy carried by the recoiling\n14C (as it is produced in the initial 10Be(14C,10Be\u2217)14C\ntwo-body reaction) the Ex spectra for the Qggg,Qgg(1) and\nQgg(2) peaks seen in Fig. 2 have been added together. The\nresultant 10Be Ex spectrum is shown in Fig. 4. The energies\nof the known [8] states at Ex = 9.56, 10.15, 11.23 and\n11.76 MeV are indicated. All appear to be observed.

Ex spectrum for the \u03b1 + 6He decay of 10Be.\nchannel. This was obtained from a Monte Carlo simulation of\nthe reaction and detection system and assumed an exponential\nangular distribution for the initial 10Be(14C,10Be)14C reaction\nand an isotropic c.m. decay. The peak detection efficiency is\nindicated (17.6%).\nThe cross section for the 10Be(14C,\u03b1 6He)14C reaction,\nobtained by integrating over all excitations in 10Be, is (48.4\u00b1\n5.4) \u00b5b. For the 6He + 6He and 4He + 8He decay of 12Be the\nupper limits are 50 and 300, nb respectively. These values are\ndependent, however, on the angular distributions used in the\nMonte Carlo simulations of detection efficiency noted above.\nIn the 10Be decay, for example, a factor of two decrease in the\nexponential angular distribution width, P(\u03b8\u2217) \u221d exp(\u2212\u03b8\u2217\/16),\nreduces \u03c3 by 30%. A factor of two increase in the width results\nin a 60% increase in the cross-section.\nTransfer reactions offer an insight into the structure of the\nstates of 10Be. The work of the group at the Hahn Meitner\nInstitut (Berlin) on pick-up and stripping reactions populating\nstates in 10Be has led to an understanding of their single-\nparticle configurations [9]. For example, the 9Be(14N,13N)10Be\nreaction strongly populates the states above 9 MeV, at\n9.27 MeV (4\u2212), 11.8 MeV and 15.34 MeV. From rotational\nsystematics it is assumed that the 11.8 and 15.34 MeV states\nare the 5\u2212 and 6\u2212 members, respectively, of the negative parity\nband which includes the 9.27 MeV (4\u2212) state. The neutron\ntransfer reaction would populate two-neutron configurations\nwhich include the p3\/2 orbit of the valence neutron in\n9Be. The negative parity states would then correspond to\np3\/2 \u2297 d5\/2 configurations. The coupling of these orbits would\nin principle lead to the population of states up to J\u03c0 = 4\u2212,\nand higher spin states require angular momentum to be gen-\nerated from the 8Be core. It should be noted that the proposed\nrotational band with member states at 6.18 MeV 0+2 , 7.54 MeV\n2+ and 10.15 MeV 4+ [10], based on a proposed (sd)2 neutron\nconfiguration, is not observed as expected. The 2p-stripping\nreaction 12C(15N,17F)10Be [9] populates the 9.27 (4\u2212),\n057301-3\nBRIEF REPORTS PHYSICAL REVIEW C 73, 057301 (2006)\n9.56 2+, 10.56 and 11.8 MeV states. The two proton removal\nreaction proceeds in two steps, allowing the excitation of\nneutron (or proton) particle-hole configurations, which is the\nexplanation for the population of the 9.27 MeV state. The pop-\nulation of the 9.56 MeV and 10.56 MeV states, not observed\nin the 1n-transfer, indicates that these have a more complex\nconfiguration than excitations within the p-shell or 1p \u2212 1h\nexcitations to the sd-shell. The 9.56 MeV state is strongly\npopulated in the reaction 7Li(7Li,\u03b1 6He)\u03b1 [11] as is the\n10.15 MeV state, and the 11.8 MeV state to a much lesser\nextent. The 9.56 and 10.15 MeV states may thus correspond to\ncombinations of one proton and two neutrons in the sd-shell.\nThe present understanding is that the 10.15 MeV state is\nassociated with two neutrons in the sd-shell and thus the\nadditional transferred proton would reside in the p-shell. The\n9.65 MeV state may thus correspond to a proton+neutron pair\nin the sd-shell.\nThe reaction kinematics and coincident detection of the\n4He and 6He at forward angles and high energy in the\npresent 10Be(14C,\u03b1 6He)14C reaction indicates the states in\n10Be are populated following the removal of an \u03b1-particle\nfrom the 14C projectile (and not by a direct decay of the 10Be\ntarget). Among the states mentioned above the 9.56, 10.15 and\n11.8 MeV states are observed. The removal of an \u03b1-particle\nfrom the dominantly p-shell nucleus 14C would, for a single-\nstep process, be expected to produce configurations in 10Be\nin which all the nucleons are confined to the p-shell. Given\nthe likely configurations of the states populated, it is clear\nthat the present reaction is more complex. It is likely that the\ncontribution of purely p-shell contributions to the excitation\nenergy region above 9 MeV is small, which would explain\nthe small cross section for the present measurements\u2014(48.4\u00b1\n5.4) \u00b5b for all states in 10Be. Similarly, the 2p removal from\n14C populating states in 12Be which then decay to 6He +\n6He is suppressed, as these states have also been predicted to\ncontain significant sd-shell components [12]. In the present\nmeasurements we conclude that neither the higher order\ncomponents in the 14C ground state wave-function, nor the\ncomplexity of the reaction process are sufficient to excite the\nrequired configurations.\nIn summary, the 10Be(14C,12Be\u2217)12C reaction has been used\nat 88.5 MeV to study the 6He + 6He and \u03b1 + 8He decay of the\nmolecular rotational band in 12Be. No evidence for the breakup\nof 12Be was obtained. The upper limits for the cross sections for\nthe 10Be(14C,6He 6He)12C and 10Be(14C,\u03b1 8He)12C reactions\nare 50 and 300 nb, respectively. The \u03b1 + 6He decay of 10Be\nwas observed via the 10Be(14C,\u03b1 6He)14C reaction with a cross\nsection of (48.4 \u00b1 5.4) \u00b5b.\nThe assistance of the staff at the Florida State University\nsuperconducting LINAC facility is gratefully acknowledged.\nThis work was funded by the United Kingdom Engineering and\nPhysical Sciences Research Council and the National Science\nFoundation.\n[1] M.
