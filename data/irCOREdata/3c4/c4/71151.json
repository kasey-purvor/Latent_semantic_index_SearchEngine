We present radar backscatter power measure-\nments using the CUTLASS HF radar at Hankasalmi, Fin-\nland from F-region field-aligned irregularities induced by\nHF radio pumping with the EISCAT Heating facility. A\nnovel radar operating mode is used in which the radar fre-\nquency is rapidly swept through a number of bands, mak-\ning use of the varying ionospheric refraction to probe dif-\nferent heights within the heated region. We obtain height\nprofiles of backscatter power which correspond to e-folding\nscale lengths of around 20 km for the mean-square electron\ndensity perturbations for pump wave interaction heights in\nthe region of 240\u2013250 km in daytime conditions. The results\nare in agreement with previous measurements made by other\ntechniques. We discuss some problems with the method and\nsuggest improvements for future experiments.\nKey words. Ionosphere (active experiments; ionospheric ir-\nregularities; instruments and techniques)\n1 Introduction\nArtificial field-aligned irregularities (AFAI) are one of the\nmost important effects produced by the interaction of a\nhigh power \u201cheater\u201d or \u201cpump\u201d high frequency (HF) wave\nwith the F-region ionosphere (Gurevich, 1978; Robinson,\n1989). In the vicinity of the layer where the pump fre-\nquency matches the local plasma upper-hybrid frequency,\nthe pump wave can couple to upper-hybrid (UH) waves.\nThese UH waves are trapped in plasma density irregular-\nities (Mj\u00f8lhus, 1983) and heat the plasma there, causing\nthe irregularities to deepen. In the magnetised F-region\nplasma, field-parallel (longitudinal) transport greatly exceeds\nfield-transverse transport and leads to the irregularities be-\ncoming greatly elongated along the magnetic field-lines.\nThese highly elongated filaments of depleted plasma density\nand enhanced electron temperature with small-scale sizes\ntransverse to the magnetic field are often referred to as\nCorrespondence to: A. Senior\n(a.senior@lancaster.ac.uk)\n\u201cstriations\u201d. Factors such as the anomalous absorption of the\npump wave (Robinson, 1989), the nonlinear increase of lon-\ngitudinal thermal conductivity (Gurevich et al., 1995) and the\ninfluence of the plasma distribution within the irregularities\non coupling of the pump wave to UH waves (Borisov and\nRobinson, 2003) are expected to be responsible for the sta-\nbilisation of the instability.\nThe fluctuations in electron density caused by the presence\nof these striations form an effective target for radar backscat-\ntering. Backscatter from AFAI was first observed at HF and\nVHF by Thome and Blood (1974), where the irregularities\nwere generated using the Platteville ionospheric heater in\nColorado, USA. These early observations established that\nthe backscatter was highly aspect-sensitive, with backscat-\nter being observed only when the radar beam was near-\northogonal to the magnetic field lines in the heated region.\nFialer (1974) reported that the backscatter power fell by at\nleast 20 dB when the deviation from orthogonality reached\n3\u25e6 and Minkoff et al. (1974) found that attempting to mea-\nsure the vertical extent of the irregularities by varying the el-\nevation angle of the radar beam resulted in nothing more than\na measurement of the radar\u2019s radiation pattern in elevation!\nFurther radar backscatter measurements established the\nfield-transverse wave number spectrum of the irregularities\n(Minkoff, 1974). These observations have been confirmed\nby in-situ rocket measurements (Kelley et al., 1995; Franz\net al., 1999). The spectrum is essentially flat with increasing\nwave number up to a first \u201cbreak-point\u201d at scales of a\nfew metres to tens of metres when an inverse power-law\ndependence takes over. Another break-point occurs at higher\nwave numbers where the power-law index changes. Franz\net al. (1999) showed that this spectral form for their in-situ\nmeasurements made at Arecibo was similar to the Platteville\nresults of Minkoff (1974), except that the break-points\noccurred at a higher wave number at Platteville. Franz et al.\n(1999) speculated that the difference may be due to the\ndiffering magnetic dip angle at the two locations and that\nhigher dip angles may lead to the break-points moving to\nhigher wave numbers.\n3504 A.

The paths of HF rays transmitted from the Hankasalmi radar\nthrough the heated volume. Frequencies of 12.4 (solid lines) and\n19.5 MHz (dashed lines) are shown for a range of elevation angles\nbetween 6\u25e6 and 30\u25e6 in steps of 2\u25e6. The regions where the rays\nlie within 1\u25e6 of orthogonality to the magnetic field line are marked\nby heavy lines. These regions are only marked for group ranges\ncorresponding to the field-of-view of the CUTLASS radar used in\nthe present experiment (\u223c480\u20131590 km). The vertical line marks\nthe ground distance of the Troms\u00f8 heater from the radar.\nRadar measurement of the vertical, or rather field-parallel,\ncharacteristics of the irregularities has proved difficult be-\ncause of the extreme aspect sensitivity described above. In-\nsitu measurements by rocket would require the rocket to fol-\nlow a near-vertical trajectory in the heated region which is\nnot easy to achieve due to constraints on launch and land-\ning sites near heating facilities. Consequently, observations\nof the vertical extent of the irregularities are less numer-\nous and less consistent. Fialer (1974) was able to estimate\nthe vertical extent from radar measurements by allowing the\nheater interaction height (where irregularities are expected\nto be strongest) to vary, causing backscatter to be obtained\nfrom a range of heights relative to the interaction height\nand concluded that the Gaussian semi-thickness of the layer\nwas about 7.5 km at Platteville. Korovin et al. (1983) de-\ntermined that the thickness of the layer was about 10 km\nby performing spatial and frequency correlation measure-\nments on radio waves scattered from the heated region. Jones\net al. (1984) made measurements of the anomalous absorp-\ntion of HF waves passing through the ionosphere heated by\nthe Troms\u00f8 heater and concluded that the e-folding vertical\nscale of the mean-square electron density perturbation in the\nirregularities was on the order of 20 km. Robinson (1989)\ngives a figure of 52 km for another anomalous absorption ex-\nperiment at Troms\u00f8.\nHedberg et al. (1983) used a backscatter radar at Kiruna,\nSweden, to observe irregularities generated by the Troms\u00f8\nheater. They used frequencies of 3 and 7 MHz and, by\nvirtue of the difference in reflection heights at the two\nradar frequencies, estimated that the vertical extent of the\nirregularities, mainly below the interaction height, was\naround 80 km under daytime conditions. Using a simi-\nlar technique with frequencies in the 2.7\u20134.8 MHz range,\nBakhmet\u2019yeva et al. (1989) found the irregularities generated\nby the Sura heater to extend at least 50 km below the interac-\ntion height.\nMeasurements of the elongation of striations are impor-\ntant in assessing the accuracy of theories of their stationary\nstate (Gurevich et al., 1995; Borisov et al., to appear in J.\nPlasma Phys., 20041). Such theories do not take into account\nthe possible effects on plasma transport due to the excita-\ntion of plasma turbulence in the region where the pump wave\ninteracts with the plasma. In addition, the small-scale irregu-\nlarities involve steep gradients in plasma density which may\nbe unstable to, for example, the drift-wave instability, as has\nbeen suggested by Kelley et al. (1995). Such instabilities\ncould prevent striations reaching the stationary state, as pre-\ndicted by current theories. Both these factors could result in\nthe elongation of striations being much less than these theo-\nries predict.\nThe experiment described here makes use of the capabil-\nities of a modern coherent scatter radar to perform multi-\nfrequency HF backscatter measurements on the irregularities\nin an attempt to determine their variation with altitude, in a\nmanner similar to Hedberg et al. (1983). By varying the HF\nradar frequency, it is possible to explore a range of heights\nthroughout the heated volume and thereby to detect the exis-\ntence and intensity of striations in the volume as a function\nof height. The principle is illustrated in Fig. 1 which shows\nthe paths of rays at two different frequencies for a range of\nelevation angles. The regions where the ray falls within 1\u25e6 of\northogonality to the magnetic field direction are indicated.\n2 Instrumentation\nThe European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) HF Heating fa-\ncility (Rietveld et al., 1993) located at Ramfjordmoen near\nTroms\u00f8, Norway (69.6\u25e6 N, 19.2\u25e6 E) was used to generate\nAFAI. An O-mode pump wave with an effective isotropic\nradiated power of 240 MW was transmitted at an angle of\n9\u25e6 south of the vertical in the magnetic meridian plane. The\nbeam width (full width at half-maximum power) was 14.5\u25e6.\nThe HF pump wave cycle was 30 s on 2.5 min off, with the\non-time synchronised to a 3-min boundary of UT. Pump fre-\nquencies of 6.2 and 7.1 MHz were used.\nThe EISCAT UHF radar (Rishbeth and van Eyken, 1993),\nco-located with the heater, was operated with the beam field-\naligned in the F-region (12.9\u25e6 south of vertical in the mag-\nnetic meridian plane) to make measurements of the iono-\nspheric plasma parameters, most importantly the electron\ndensity profile.\nWhilst the radar is capable of accurately measuring the\nshape of the electron-density profile, including \u201cvalleys\u201d\n1Borisov, N., Senior, A. and Honary, F.: Stationary state and\nrelaxation of artificial irregularities excited in ionospheric heating\nexperiments, to appear in J. Plasma Phys., 2004.\nA. Senior et al.: HF radar measurements of artificial irregularities 3505\nwhich may be unseen by an ionosonde, the measurement is\nnot absolute and must be calibrated, for example, by com-\nparing the peak plasma frequency with that measured by\nan ionosonde (foF2). Accurate absolute electron densities\nare important for the ray-tracing analysis used to assess the\nregion of the ionosphere viewed by the CUTLASS coher-\nent scatter radar. The EISCAT Dynasonde and the Troms\u00f8\nDigisonde (both co-located with the heater) were used to pro-\nvide this calibration. The Dynasonde made soundings at 6-\nmin intervals and the Digisonde at 15-min intervals.\nIn order to detect the electron density perturbations of the\nstriations, the CUTLASS (Co-operative UK Twin Located\nAuroral Sounding System) HF coherent scatter radar (Milan\net al., 1997b) at Hankasalmi, Finland (62.3\u25e6 N, 26.6\u25e6 E) was\nemployed. The radar can operate two different modes simul-\ntaneously (Lester et al., 2004), the two modes being referred\nto as channels A and B. In this paper we analyse data from\nchannel B only which operated a single beam (beam 5) that\npasses approximately through the centre of the heated region.\nThe radar frequency on channel B was stepped through a set\nof frequency bands of widths \u2264265 kHz covering part of the\nradar\u2019s frequency range (8\u201320 MHz), the band being changed\nevery second. The exact frequency used within a band is\nchosen automatically by the radar on the basis of least inter-\nference. Both channels measured 75 range gates at 15-km\nspacing, with the nominal range to the first gate at 480 km.\nAllowing for the receiver propagation delay of 100\u00b5s, the\nrange to the centre of the first gate is in fact 457.5 km. These\ncorrected ranges were used in the data analysis. Figure 2 de-\npicts the experimental configuration used.\nFor each beam sounded, the CUTLASS radar records the\nparameters resulting from functional fits to the autocorrela-\ntion function of the received signal in each range gate, as\nwell as various system parameters. In this experiment we\nare interested in measuring the backscatter power, since this\nis proportional to the mean-square electron density variation\nin the irregularities. The radar does not record backscatter\npower but signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To obtain backscat-\nter power we must multiply the SNR by the noise level and\nmake an allowance for the receiver attenuator setting. Here\nwe stop short of making an absolute calibration of the power\nand quote powers in decibels relative to an arbitrary refer-\nence.\nThe radar antenna gain increases with frequency. For an\nelevation angle of 10\u25e6 (15\u25e6) the gain increases by about 5 dB\n(3 dB) from 12\u201320 MHz. Since the same antenna is used for\ntransmission and reception, this amounts to an increase of\n10 dB (6 dB) from 12\u201320 MHz. This is significant compared\nto the observed variation in power with frequency, and we\ncompensate for it by subtracting twice the antenna gain in dB\nrelative to an isotropic radiator from the measurements, giv-\ning a \u201ccorrected power\u201d which is effectively what would be\nmeasured if the antenna was an isotropic radiator. The cor-\nrection applied is obtained from the antenna radiation pat-\ntern based on both the operating frequency and the eleva-\ntion angle of arrival of the backscatter signal estimated from\nray tracing.

Also\nshown is the field-of-view of beam 5 of the Hankasalmi radar used\nin the experiment.\nscattering, we must also take into account the variations in\nantenna beamwidth, since these determine how the size of\nour scattering volume varies. The aspect sensitivity of the\nirregularities means that, to a good approximation, the target\ndoes not fill the beam in elevation and therefore we may ne-\nglect the variation of the beamwidth in elevation (from about\n25\u25e6 at 12 MHz to 14\u25e6 at 20 MHz, at \u22123 dB relative to the\npeak). We cannot neglect the variation in azimuth since the\ntarget does indeed fill the beam in this plane; even though\nthe heater beamwidth itself (at \u22123 dB) when projected to\nF-region heights may not fill the radar beam in azimuth, the\nirregularities are excited over a much larger area and are typ-\nically observed in at least the two beams adjacent to beam 5\n(Bond et al., 1997). The azimuthal beamwidth (at\u22123 dB) de-\ncreases from 5.6\u25e6 at 12 MHz to 3.2\u25e6 at 20 MHz and is in fact\nalmost exactly inversely proportional to frequency. We cor-\nrect our observed powers for azimuthal beamwidth by sub-\ntracting the logarithmic beamwidth (in dB) from the pow-\ners. No correction for range has been applied to the data:\nthe heater-induced backscatter was only received over the\nrange interval approximately 900\u20131000 km (see Fig. 3). The\nbackscatter power would be expected to fall as the inverse\nsquare of range in the case of a fully beam-filling target or as\nthe inverse fourth-power of range in the case of a point tar-\nget. Our case will fall somewhere between these limits, but\nthe difference in range-correction between 900 and 1000 km\nwould amount to only 1.8 dB even in the case of an inverse\nfourth-power dependence on range.\nFor the purpose of these corrections, the antenna radia-\ntion patterns were computed using the commercial EZNEC\nsoftware package which is based on the NEC-2 (Numerical\nElectromagnetics Code) computation engine.

Sample of radar backscatter power observations during a HF pump cycle. The top panel shows the backscatter power (dB) and the\nbottom panel the radar frequency (MHz). The HF pump was turned on at 10:24:00 UT and off at 10:24:30 UT on 5 November 2002. The\nAFAI backscatter can be seen between ranges of 900 and 1000 km.\nwas modelled as having a conductivity of 7.5\u00d710\u22123 S m\u22121\nand a dielectric constant of 12. The version of software used\nwas limited in its ability to handle complicated antenna sys-\ntems like the CUTLASS array and so the modelling was per-\nformed in two stages by first computing the radiation pattern\nof a single log-periodic antenna of the type used in the ar-\nray and then by computing the radiation pattern of an array\nof resonant half-wavelength dipoles having the same height\nand spacing as the antennae in the CUTLASS array. The re-\nsults were then combined to give the radiation pattern of the\narray of log-periodic antennae as used by CUTLASS.\nThe gain of the receiver is reasonably constant over the\nrange 9\u201320 MHz, varying by 1 dB or less. The gain is down\nby about 4 dB at 8 MHz due to a steep filter cutoff to pre-\nvent interference from HF broadcast stations. Since we do\nnot use frequencies below 10 MHz, we make no correction\nfor receiver gain. Similarly, the attenuation due to the an-\ntenna phasing network used to form the beam for reception\nincreases by only 0.6 dB over the range 8\u201320 MHz and we\nmake no correction for this. We assume that the transmitter\npower remains constant across the frequency range.\n3 Data analysis and results\nSeveral runs of the experiment were carried out in the period\n2\u20138 November 2002. The best quality data were taken on 5\nNovember 2002 and 8 November 2002. However, for reasons\nto be addressed later, in this paper we will analyse results\nfrom 11 November 2002 only, specifically the period 10:24\u2013\n11:00 UT.\nA typical example of the radar observations during a pump\ncycle is shown in Fig. 3. Backscatter is observed in beam\n5 between ranges of approximately 900 and 1000 km im-\nmediately after pump-on. The backscatter is observed on\nseveral frequencies but with different intensities, leading to\nthe characteristic cyclic pattern in the colours on the plot.\nThe backscatter fades gradually after pump-off. This growth\nand relaxation behaviour is typical of that observed in such\nexperiments (Frolov et al., 1997). Since we are interested in\nthe variation in backscatter power with frequency and since\nthe same radar frequency band is visited several times during\none pump-on period, we may reduce the data by averaging\ntogether the backscatter powers observed on the same fre-\nquency band during the same pump-on period. As noted ear-\nlier, the exact frequency used in a band may vary, but since\nthe bands have widths of between 15 and 265 kHz, we treat\nall frequencies in the same band as being the same frequency,\ntaken to be equal to the centre frequency of the band. Fur-\nthermore, since we are concerned with the stationary state of\nthe irregularities, we neglect the first 10 s of each pump-on\nperiod to reduce contamination from the growth phase. The\nresult of this frequency binning is shown in the left panel of\nFig. 4 where it has been applied to the pump-on period in\nFig. 3.\n3.1 Mapping of the radar data using ray tracing\nIn order to interpret the observations, it is essential to know\nwhere the radar backscatter comes from in the ionosphere.\nTo answer this question, a ray-tracing analysis was carried\nout. The ionospheric electron density profile obtained from\nthe UHF radar for the time of the pump cycle under consid-\neration was used for this purpose. This carries an implicit\nassumption that the profile remains correct over the entire\nray path from the CUTLASS radar to the scattering volume.\nSince this is a distance of around 900 km, this is unlikely to\nbe correct but we may note that the rays in which we are\ninterested do not actually enter the ionosphere until approx-\nimately half-way along the path, see Fig. 1.

Right panel: the data from the left panel mapped to the locations in the ionosphere where\nthe scattering is occuring, assuming exact orthogonality. This mapping is carried out by means of ray-tracing results like those in Fig. 1.\nThe horizontal dashed line indicates the upper-hybrid resonance height, determined from the electron density profile. The vertical dashed\nline indicates the ground distance of the heater from the CUTLASS radar. The power has been corrected for antenna gain and azimuthal\nbeamwidth.\nwas carried out using a modified version of the Jones 3-D\nprogram (Jones and Stephenson, 1975). A dipole magnetic\nfield model was used for speed in the ray tracing. To de-\ntermine the angle of the radar wave from orthogonality at\na given point, the wave propagation vectors were compared\nwith the magnetic field direction obtained from the Interna-\ntional Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) model for 2002\n(extrapolated from IGRF 2000) which provides a more accu-\nrate model than a dipole approximation. No significant dif-\nference was found by using the IGRF field in the ray tracing\nitself, as might be expected since the radar wave propagation\nis near-transverse to the magnetic field and is not greatly af-\nfected by it (Davies, 1990). Using the results of the ray trac-\ning we can estimate the altitude and ground distance from\nthe transmitter at which exact orthogonality is reached for a\ngiven radar frequency and group range, which is what the\nCUTLASS radar measures. This enables us to map the radar\nrange gates to the locations in the ionosphere from which the\nbackscatter is assumed to originate.\nThe right panel of Fig. 4 demonstrates this mapping for\nthe data shown in the left panel of the figure. As expected,\nthe higher frequencies map to higher altitudes in the iono-\nsphere due to lower refraction. The loci of orthogonality\nslope downwards with increasing range as rays of a given\nfrequency having lower take-off angles reflect at lower alti-\ntudes. We can see that the backscatter power increases with\naltitude towards the upper-hybrid resonance height. We can\nalso note that the region of strongest backscatter is biased to-\nwards shorter distances from the radar. This may be because\nthe pump beam was directed south of the zenith (slightly to-\nwards the CUTLASS radar). Similar effects were reported\nby Dhillon (2002). It is also possible that the backscatter is\nweaker at greater ranges because it originates at lower alti-\ntudes where the irregularities are weaker.\nThis mapping procedure works well in most cases, but oc-\ncasionally problems are encountered. Figure 5 shows one\nsuch case. The two highest frequencies show strong scatter\nin gates which are not mapped in the right-hand panel of the\n3508 A.

The same as Fig. 4 but for the pump cycle beginning at 10:27 UT. Note that on the two highest frequencies, not all of the gates where\nstrong scatter is detected in the left panel are mapped in the right panel.\nfigure because the ray-tracing analysis fails to find orthogo-\nnality at the group ranges of these gates on the relevant fre-\nquencies. There are at least two possible explanations for this\ndiscrepancy. Firstly, the scatter might be occuring at angles\nslightly off exact orthogonality, but considering the previous\nobservations cited earlier, this seems unlikely. Secondly and\nmore probably, the model of the ionospheric electron density\nused in the ray tracing, based on the single measurement at\nthe end of the path near Troms\u00f8, is not always a sufficiently\naccurate description of the ionosphere for the ray tracing to\nreproduce the observations exactly.\n3.2 Summary of results\nHaving described the method of analysis applied to the ob-\nservations from each pump cycle, we now summarise the\nresults from the experimental run of 5 November 2002,\n10:00\u201311:00 UT. Figure 6 shows a time series of height pro-\nfiles of backscatter power obtained from successive pump\ncycles. The profiles are extracted from the orthogonality-\nmapped range gates by identifying the gate having the largest\nbackscatter power over all frequencies and then choosing all\ngates having the same group range as this gate. The result-\ning profiles are quasi-vertical through the heated region, as\ncan be seen by considering Figs. 4 and 5. This procedure\nwas adopted as a simple alternative to performing a two-\ndimensional interpolation across the gates to give an exact\nvertical or field-aligned profile. Indicated on the plot are the\nthe upper-hybrid resonance heights. It is clear from the plot\nthat the increase in backscatter power with height is a consis-\ntent feature. During the cycles starting in the period 10:24\u2013\n10:45 UT, the pump frequency was 6.2 MHz, changing to\n7.1 MHz from 10:48 UT. The increase in the reflection height\non switching to the higher frequency is clearly seen.\nIn the pump cycles between 10:24 and 10:45 UT the\nmaximum (corrected) backscatter power is typically about\n\u221225 dB and is found at or within about 10 km of the upper-\nhybrid resonance height. For the later cycles the maximum\nis much less, around \u221240 dB but is found more than 10 km\nbelow the upper-hybrid resonance height. In these later cy-\ncles it would appear that the CUTLASS radar is only view-\ning the lower \u201ctail\u201d of the irregularities and not the region\nclose to the upper-hybrid resonance height itself, with greater\nheights being inaccessible because of the upper frequency\nlimit of the radar. However, another explanation of the re-\nduced backscatter power is possible. The nearby imaging\nA.

The diagonal dotted lines indicate linear fits to the profiles and the\ndistances indicated in each panel are the e-folding lengths of the electron density perturbations derived from these fits.\nriometer at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi, Finland (69.1\u25e6 N, 20.8\u25e6 E; see Fig. 2)\nobserved an increased level of cosmic noise absorption at\n38.2 MHz during the period 10:45\u201311:00 UT in the beam\nwhich intersects the D-region above the heater site. Although\nthe absorption was only on the order of 0.5 dB at 38.2 MHz\nthis could mean substantial D-region absorption (\u223c14 dB) of\nthe HF pump wave at 6\u20137 MHz and a consequent reduction\nin its effect in the F-region. Before 10:45 UT the riometer\nabsorption varied between 0.1 and 0.2 dB.\nAssuming that the backscatter power is proportional to the\nmean-square electron density perturbation in the irregulari-\nties, a linear fit to the logarithm of the power enables us to\nestimate the e-folding length of irregularities. These linear\nfits and scale lengths are shown in Fig. 6. The exponential\ndecay model is only an approximation but appears reasonable\nfor the profiles shown here. We see that in the period 10:24-\n10:42 UT the scale lengths are similar, having a mean value\nof 19 km and a standard deviation of 6 km. This is consistent\nwith previous measurements at Troms\u00f8 during daytime con-\nditions (Jones et al., 1984). After 10:45 UT the scale lengths\napparently become much greater. As discussed earlier, this\nmay be either because the CUTLASS radar is viewing only\nthe tail of the irregularities or because the irregularities are\nsimply weaker because of D-region absorption and the errors\nin the CUTLASS measurement are higher. In the 10:54 UT\npump cycle, the linear fit had a negative slope (not shown),\nprobably due to measurement uncertainties in the power.\n4 Discussion\nWe have demonstrated how a coherent scatter HF radar may\nbe used to examine the height profile of the electron den-\nsity perturbations induced in the F-region by the action of\na powerful electromagnetic wave. These observations were\nmade in daytime conditions (\u223c12:00 LT) and are consistent\nwith similar observations made by the anomalous absorp-\ntion technique at Troms\u00f8 (Jones et al., 1984). The aim of\nthe experiment was to study irregularities with small-scale\nsizes transverse to the magnetic field (striations). The radar\ntechnique is sensitive to fluctuations in the electron density\nwith scales equal to half the radar wavelength. In the obser-\nvations presented here, the radar frequency covered at most\nthe range 13\u201320 MHz, corresponding to irregularity scales\nof 7.5\u201311.5 m, although as Kelley et al. (1995) pointed out,\nlarger-scale irregularities with steep gradients in this range\nof lengths could also give rise to backscatter. The radar mea-\nsurements of Hedberg et al. (1983) and Bakhmet\u2019yeva et al.\n(1989) were made on relatively low frequencies correspond-\ning to irregularity scales of 20\u201350 m and 30\u201350 m, respec-\ntively. It is possible that at these larger scales, the radar is\nviewing irregularities generated by other mechanisms, for\nexample, thermal self-focussing of the pump wave (Gure-\nvich, 1978) rather than small-scale striations.\nSince the lower frequencies reach orthogonality at lower\naltitudes, the radar views larger-scale irregularities at lower\nheights. If there is a significant dependence of field-parallel\nscale on field-transverse scale, this means that the observed\nprofile of electron density perturbation is a combination of\nprofiles for different transverse scale sizes. Jones et al.\n(1984) explained that the anomalous absorption technique is\nnot as sensitive to the transverse scale spectrum of the irreg-\nularities and essentially measures the overall density pertur-\nbation. They suggested that simultaneous comparison of that\nmethod with the radar technique (as described here) might\nhelp identify what role the transverse scale spectrum plays,\nbut so far such simultaneous experiments do not appear to\nhave been carried out.\nIt is interesting to note that in all our observations, we only\nviewed the irregularities below the upper-hybrid resonance\nheight. Referring to Fig. 6 it is clear that had we chosen\nlower pump frequencies and thus lower upper-hybrid reso-\nnance heights, we would have been able to view the irreg-\nularities both above and below the upper-hybrid resonance\nheight. In the experiment described here, the pump fre-\nquency was increased with time as the ionospheric plasma\nfrequency increased, resulting in the upper-hybrid resonance\nheight remaining relatively close to the F-region plasma den-\nsity peak. This situation makes it more difficult to achieve\northogonality in the region above the upper-hybrid resonance\nlevel. Considering Fig. 1, in order to reach orthogonality at\nthese altitudes (above 250 km, say), the rays must initially\nhave relatively high elevation angles and therefore must un-\ndergo considerable refraction to reach orthogonality. Close\nto the F-region peak and into the topside, the refraction is ei-\nther too weak or in the wrong direction to bring the rays to or-\nthogonality. Using lower frequencies results in orthogonality\n3510 A. Senior et al.: HF radar measurements of artificial irregularities\nbeing reached either at too low an altitude or too short a\nground distance, whereas as the frequency is increased, rays\nat the higher elevation angles penetrate the ionosphere before\nreaching orthogonality.\nIn discussing Fig. 5 we pointed out an inconsistency be-\ntween the coherent radar observations and the ray-tracing\nanalysis, which is probably due to an inadequate model of\nthe ionospheric electron density distribution along the path\nfrom the radar to the scattering volume. In attempting to\nanalyse the data collected on 8 November 2002, during the\nperiod 15:00\u201317:00 UT, we found that this inconsistency was\nmore severe, often resulting in the ray tracing indicating no\northogonality in gates on the higher radar frequencies which\nshowed the strongest backscatter, suggesting that the ray-\ntracing model was underestimating the ionospheric refrac-\ntion. This inevitably must also cast some doubt on the re-\nliability of the ray tracing for the data presented here, even\nthough no major discrepancies are observed in the majority\nof the cases. The accuracy of the ray tracing should be im-\nproved by means of more detailed information on the elec-\ntron density distribution. This could be obtained by point-\ning the UHF incoherent scatter radar along the Hankasalmi-\nTroms\u00f8 path at different elevation angles and possibly sup-\nplemented by ionosondes in the vicinity of the path.\nThe CUTLASS radar is equipped with an interferometer to\nmeasure the elevation angle of arrival of the backscatter sig-\nnal (Milan et al., 1997a). Unfortunately, technical problems\nwith the radar meant that we were unable to interpret the el-\nevation angle data in this experiment. These data would fur-\nther allow us to test the accuracy of the ray tracing and even\nto confirm if the scatter we are observing truly is originating\nat different heights on different frequencies or if it originates\nfrom similar heights. In the latter case the variation in power\nwith frequency may in fact be due to the varying aspect\nangle of the radar beam to the irregularities, contradicting\nour assumption of near-infinite aspect sensitivity, although\nas explained in the Introduction, this assumption seems rea-\nsonable. In future experiments, modifying the CUTLASS\nsounding mode to collect returns from meteor trail ionisation\nat near-ranges will allow for the calibration of the elevation\nangles: assuming that meteor ionisation occurs in a narrow\nheight interval in the E-layer and that ionospheric refraction\nof the radar beam can be neglected (straight-line propaga-\ntion), there follows a simple relationship between radar range\nto the meteor trails and elevation angle.\nSome of the observations (e.g. Fig. 4) suggest that the fre-\nquency range scanned by the CUTLASS radar was some-\ntimes too narrow to cover the whole height interval occupied\nby AFAI, since the backscatter was still quite strong at the\nlowest frequency. In future experiments, using a much wider\nrange of frequencies, perhaps always the full 8\u201320 MHz\nrange of the radar, will ensure that we view the full extent\nof the irregularities. Furthermore, the use of several closely\nspaced frequency bands meant that we obtained measure-\nments which are bunched in altitude rather than evenly dis-\ntributed. This does not make optimal use of the radar but, on\nthe other hand, there may be an advantage in confirming that\nthe measurements are consistent between similar frequen-\ncies, indicating no anomalies in the radar system.\nThe method described here may be used to investigate\ndifferences in the scale-lengths of striations under different\nionospheric conditions. This will be an important test of the-\nories describing the plasma transport processes associated\nwith striations, since the transport coefficients will depend\non the electron density and the bulk electron heating which\ndiffers considerably between daytime and nighttime condi-\ntions: compare, for example, the electron temperature obser-\nvations of Stocker et al. (1992) in daytime conditions with\nthose of Rietveld et al. (2003) in nighttime conditions. In\naddition, our results have practical value in helping to un-\nderstand the propagation factors involved in maximising the\nbackscatter power observed from heater-induced irregulari-\nties. Heater-induced coherent radar backscatter has found\nimportant applications in the study of magnetospheric ultra-\nlow frequency waves using the CUTLASS and EISCAT fa-\ncilities (Yeoman and Wright, 2001) and future work with\nthis technique is planned using CUTLASS and the recently\ncomissioned SPEAR heater-radar facility located on Sval-\nbard inside the polar cap (Wright et al., 2000). It is clear from\nour analysis that one must choose the pump and radar fre-\nquencies carefully to ensure that the irregularities are viewed\nclose to their greatest intensity whilst taking account of the\nradar antenna gain variations with frequency and elevation\nangle.\n5 Conclusions\nIn summary, we have found that it is practical to use a HF\ncoherent scatter radar to explore the height variation of the\nelectron density perturbations in irregularities generated by\nradiowave pumping of the ionosphere. The results presented\nare in agreement with previous measurements by other tech-\nniques, giving e-folding scale lengths of\u223c20 km for the den-\nsity perturbations in the irregularities for upper-hybrid res-\nonance heights of 240\u2013250 km in daytime conditions. We\nhave found that inaccuracies in our knowledge of the elec-\ntron density distribution in the ionosphere affects our ability\nto map the location of the radar backscatter by means of ray\ntracing and suggest that this could be ameliorated by using\nthe incoherent scatter radar to make measurements along the\nHF radar propagation path. Improvements in the choice of\nfrequencies used on the HF radar and the availability of el-\nevation angle measurements will further enhance the tech-\nnique. By making similar observations in daytime and night-\ntime conditions, it should be possible to investigate the influ-\nence of the plasma transport coefficients on the field-parallel\nscale of the irregularities, which will be useful for testing\ntheories of the stationary state of these irregularities.\nAcknowledgements.
