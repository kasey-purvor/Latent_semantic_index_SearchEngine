This intervention is compared and contrasted with an unsuccessful one \nreported in Hodgkinson and Wright [1]. We demonstrate that analysis of the answers \ngiven by workshop participants in a pre-intervention interview can be helpful in \ndetermining the receptiveness of an organization to a subsequent scenario \nintervention. We theorise that strategic inertia - characterized by coping patterns of \nbolstering failing strategy, procrastination (over a strategic dilemma) and buck-\npassing (the responsibility for the dilemma\u201fs resolution), can be caused by the \npsychological attenuation of the perceived level of environmental threat to the \norganisation, culminating in unconflicted adherence to the currently-followed strategy. \nWe contend that the expression of such coping behavior is antithetical to a \nsubsequent successful scenario exercise since, if the exercise fails to identify an \nunconflicted strategic alternative, the sharp focus of the scenarios on futures \nunfavourable to business-as-usual strategy will re-activate the cognitive stress-\nreduction mechanisms. Strategic inertia will thus be reinforced. We conclude with a \nreview of the implications of our diagnosis for reflective practitioners. \nOur paper is divided into four sections. In section one, we overview writings on inertia \nin strategic decision making.  We pay especial attention to identifying potential \ncauses of inertia.  Next, we present Janis and Mann\u201fs [2] views of the psychological \nprocesses invoked by conflicted decisions and analyse the relevance of this \nlaboratory-based theory to provide a psychological explanation of strategic inertia.  \nFinally, we briefly describe the scenario intervention process and argue that it \ncontains the potential to overcome strategic inertia.  In section 2, we review an \nalready-published study of an unsuccessful scenario planning intervention which \nillustrates the operation of components of Janis and Mann\u201fs model.  Next, in section \n3, we focus on our own case investigation of a successful scenario planning \nintervention.  The early part of this section documents the \u201csuccess\u201d, whilst the latter \npart analyses the causes of the success \u2013 again using the components of Janis and \nMann\u201fs model.  We conclude in Section 4, where we compare and contrast the \napplication of Janis and Mann\u201fs model to both cases and we demonstrate  that \napplication of the model to pre-intervention interview data can aid the practitioner \ndetermine, at the outset, whether or not the organizational context will be receptive to \nthe intervention. \n \n \n \n1 INERTIA IN STRATEGIC DECISION MAKING \nWriters on strategic management have argued that for continued survival an \norganization\u201fs strategic decision making must achieve the retention of the \norganization\u201fs alignment with the external environment. (Hamel [3], Hamel and \nPralahad [4], van der Heijden [5]. Failure to achieve this results in strategic drift \nJohnson [6]. Huff et al [7] contend that inertia in such (re)alignment, defined as the \ndegree of the level of commitment to the organisation\u201fs current strategy, will grow \nover time as current ways of operating become deeply embedded in an organization, \nregardless of, and generally without reference to, developments in the environment. \nCommitment to the status quo will, they argue, escalate in a smooth, undisturbed \nfashion over time with incremental adjustments to the current strategy and little \nconscious attention to strategic choice, so long as organizational performance is \nsatisfactory. However, if and when it becomes evident within the organisation that \nthere is no longer an appropriate alignment between its strategy and the \nrequirements of the environment, \u201cpressure for change\u201d will inevitably develop. While \nthe causes of degree of pressure for change are not fully developed in their paper, \nreference is made to specific events such as \u201einventions\u201f, \u201eexecutive succession\u201f, and \n\u201epoor performance reports\u201f (p.58). \n \nBarr et al [8] address the issue of why some organisations are able to realign their \nstrategy with a changing environment, whilst others are not, offering a cognitive \nexplanation for the lack of organizational renewal. They argue that \u201ehuman (cognitive) \nfrailties\u201f mean that managers\u201f mental models of the competitive environment may be \nincomplete or inaccurate, and that these models \u201eoften fail to change in a timely \nmanner in response to a changing environment\u201f (p.17). Wack [9] suggests that in \ntimes or relative environmental stability there is generally a reasonably good match \nbetween the mental models of successful decision-makers and \u201cunfolding reality\u201d. In \ntimes of rapid change however, the decision makers\u201f mental models become \u201ca \ndangerously mixed bag; rich detail and understanding can co-exist with dubious \nassumptions, selective inattention to alternative interpretations of evidence and \nprojections that are pretense\u201d. For example, Porac et al [10] studied competitive \nmodels of senior managers in the Scottish knitwear industry. Although Scottish \nknitwear producers account for less than 5% of world production, when knitwear \nindustry managers were asked to define their competitors, the serious competitors \nwere almost exclusively nominated as Scottish. Hodgkinson [11] meanwhile found \nthat UK residential estate agents\u201f mental representation of competition remained \nstable despite a significant downturn in the market over the 12-18 month period of his \nstudy.  \n \nThe problem is that incomplete, inaccurate and otherwise inappropriate mental \nmodels may \u201eprevent managers from sensing problems, delay changes in strategy, \nand lead to action that is ineffective in a new environment\u201f (Barr et al [8]) In times of \nrapid change, Wack [9] contends, strategic failure \u201cis often caused by a crisis of \nperception, that is, the inability to see an emergent novel reality by being locked \ninside obsolete assumptions, particularly in large, well-run companies\u201d. \n \nBarr et al [8] suggest that munificent environments may confirm outdated mental \nmodels in that organizational weaknesses, even if recognised within organisations, \nmay go unaddressed if the organisations continue to enjoy profitability (See also \nWhetten [12]). Perhaps more importantly, firms that survive or flourish in \nenvironments that become inhospitable will, they argue, evidence change in their \nmanagers\u201f mental models. In an empirical study of these hypotheses, Barr et al [8] \ncontent-analysed the letters to shareholders published by two railroad companies \nover a 25-year period. The surviving firm created new strategy to more closely match \na changing environment; the failing firm, in contrast, did not make any fundamental \nchanges to its strategy until it was near bankruptcy at which point, a discontinuous \nchange in strategy occurred, but came too late to save the company. Miller and Chen \n[13] found that \u201ecompetitive inertia\u201f, defined as the (low) level of activity that a firm \nexhibits when altering its competitive stance, was driven by good past performance \nand counteracted by diversity in a firm\u201fs markets. \n \nFurther evidence of strategic inertia comes from Johnson\u201fs [14] single longitudinal \ncase study of the UK retail clothing industry. The focus of the study was on the \n(mis)match between changes in the firm\u201fs strategy as it sought to succeed in a \nchanging environment, the objective of the study being to identify whether \nincremental changes in strategy were beneficial or harmful to overall survival and \nsuccess. The study concluded that market signals of a failing strategy were not \ninterpreted as such within the organisation, and that managers in a previously \nsuccessful business sought to reduce the perceived importance of dissonant \ninformation, such that the prevailing strategy was not threatened. Johnson showed \nthat resultant incremental change in strategy did not keep pace with environmental \nchange, leading ultimately to strategic drift. The sensing of external signals it was \nreasoned, is muted within the organisation because the signals are not meaningful in \nthemselves but take on relevance from the viewpoint of the managers\u201f metal model. \nAt the same time, political pressures within the organization act to quell dissonant or \n\u201edeviant\u201f opinion, which recognize the true, paradigm-threatening nature of the \ninformation (see also Miller and Friesen, [15]).   \nThe above studies point to the negative characteristics of inertia and incrementalism \nin strategic decision making. However, as Hannan and Freeman [16], Miller and \nFriesen [15] and Miller and Chen [13] have argued, in simpler less turbulent \nenvironments, inertia in some aspects of strategy may allow managers to focus on \nthe most important issues and avoid costly blunders that come through making ill-\nconsidered step-changes in a well-aligned strategy. Clearly then, the appropriateness \nof strategic inertia and incrementalism need to be evaluated in light of the nature and \ndegree of environmental change. \n \nNote that the causal mechanisms behind strategic inertia have not been well \ndescribed or documented in the strategic management literature.  Rumelt [17] has \nargued that motivational dampers (including direct costs of change, cannibalisation \ncosts, and cross-subsidiary comforts), failed creative response (including reactive \nmindset and inadequate strategic vision), overwhelming pride in past success, \npotential deadlocks (including organizational politics and vested interests), and action \ndisconnects (including leadership inaction and capability gaps) underpin inertia.  \nKisfalvi [18] has argued that the personalities of the chief executive can underpin \ninappropriate strategic persistance, (see also Knight et al [19], for discussion of the \ndemographic characteristic of top teams and organizational performance).  Barr et al \n[20] have argued that \u201c\u2026 strategic change becomes more and more probable as the \n\u2026 pressure for change \u2026 resulting from various stimuli exceeds the current level of \ninertia (pressure to maintain the status quo\u201d (p 342)   However,  as Huff and Huff  \n[21]) have argued, \u201c\u2026 there is little guidance from the literature \u2026 to suggest when \nresponse \u2026 will focus an incremental homeostatic adjustments (to strategy) and \nwhen more dramatic \u2026 change in direction traditionally of interest to strategy \nresearchers is likely to occur\u201d (p 84).  \n \n1.1  Janis and Mann\u2019s psychological theory as an explanation of strategic \ninertia \nIn this Section, we locate one cause of strategic inertia to the action of psychological \nprocesses - which can attenuate the pressure for strategic change. Janis and Mann\u201fs \n[2] \u201eConflict Theory\u201f model provides a comprehensive account of decision processes \nthat are engendered in response to decision dilemmas, and as such their theory \ncould, potentially account for the case findings of strategic inertia.  The theory \ndescribes a number of basic patterns of coping with a challenge, be it a threat or an \nopportunity. Intense conflicts, Janis and Mann argue, are likely to arise whenever an \nindividual has to make an important decision. Such conflicts become acute as the \ndecision maker becomes aware of the risk of suffering serious losses from whatever \ncourse of action is selected. Decisional conflicts in this context refer to simultaneous \nopposing tendencies within the individual to accept or reject a given course of action. \nThe most prominent symptoms of such conflicts are hesitation, vacillation, feelings of \nuncertainty and signs of acute emotional stress whenever a decision comes within \nthe focus of attention.  \n According to Janis and Mann, several types of decisional behaviour called \u201ecoping \npatterns\u201f are the direct result of the conflict. Only one coping pattern, vigilance, \nresults in the careful search for and use of information in the face of a challenge. A \nprecondition for vigilance is that the decision makers must have concluded that \namongst other things, a better solution(s) does exist and that there is adequate time \nto debate and search for it, the result of which is a moderate level of stress. \nHypervigilance, a second coping pattern, results when the decision makers are \naware that a better solution probably does exist, but perceive that they have \ninsufficient time to engage in a search for it. Meanwhile defensive avoidance \nbehaviour, a third coping pattern, arises when the perception is that no better solution \nexists other than the current course of action, and can take one of three forms: \nprocrastination which involves postponing the decision; buck passing which involves \nshifting the responsibility of the decision to someone else; and bolstering which \nincludes exaggerating the favourable consequences of a course of action and \nminimizing the unfavourable consequences. Bolstering, as an observable behavior, \nshares characteristics with non-rational escalation of commitment but the \nmechanisms that are theorised to induce this behavior are separable. \n \nBoth hypervigilance and defensive avoidance are preceded by high stress, since \nthere is recognition that the risks associated with adhering to the current option(s) are \nserious. Unconflicted adherence, a fourth coping pattern, is preceded by low stress, \nsince here the decision maker views the current course of action as unthreatened \nand the outcomes associated with alternative courses of action as inconsequential. \nSearch for information regarding the consequences of changing a decision is minimal \nand, since no risks are thought to be associated with it, the current course of action is \nadhered to. Such a coping pattern can be seen as analogous to inertia in strategic \ndecision making. Unconflicted change, a fifth coping pattern, is also preceded by low \nstress since here a threatened current course of action can be replaced by an \nalternative, unthreatened course of action. Figure 1 details the essential elements of \nthis theoretical model, as related to the current context of strategic decision making. \n \n------------------------------------------------------------ \nINSERT FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE \n------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n \n1.2 Overcoming strategic inertia with scenario planning \n \nThe process of scenario planning provides an apt framework through which the \nappropriateness of a particular strategy or range of strategic options can be tested for \nenvironmental fit and robustness. Additionally, since the essence of scenario thinking \nis to examine a range of plausible, alternative futures, the process intervention \nfacilitates the expression of dissenting opinion within the organisation as to what the \nfuture may hold and challenges potentially inappropriate confidence in terms of both \na single point future and a single, tried-and-trusted strategy. Simple extrapolations of \nthe past and single point best guesses about the evolving state of the external \nenvironment are thus attenuated, and the degree of alignment between strategy and \na range of futures becomes the focus of attention (van der Heijden et al [22]). For a \nfuller account of scenarios and the scenario process, see van der Heijden [5], van \nder Heijden et al [22], Schoemaker [23], Ringland [24] and Schwartz, [25]. \n \nThe most appropriate point for a scenario planning intervention in an organisation is, \ntheoretically, after there is recognition that the environmental threat to the \norganisation\u201fs current strategy is high, but before the psychological processes \ninherent in coping behaviour described above are activated. As yet, however, little is \nknown about whether or not there is a time delay, and if so, how long, between \nmanagement\u201fs recognition of a serious environmental threat to current strategy and \nthe activation of coping patterns. Janis and Mann\u201fs model infers that the engagement \nand deployment of coping patterns are automatic and subconscious, such that \nindividual managers will not recognise their deployment. Once the coping patterns \nhave been deployed, recognition of the need for, and the value of, scenario planning \nmay be lost. \n \nThe next section summarizes the results of a failed scenario planning intervention \nand links this to the operation of the Janis and Mann\u201fs conflict model of decision \nmaking, previously outlined. \n \n \n2 HODGKINSON AND WRIGHT\u2019S STUDY OF A MANAGEMENT TEAM \nFACING A DECISION DILEMMA \n \nHodgkinson and Wright [1] interviewed nine individuals comprising the senior \nmanagement team of a major corporation (Beta Co) facing a crucial strategic \ndecision dilemma. The interviews were conducted prior to a scenario planning \nexercise in which all of the interviewees were subsequently active participants.  \nThere was clear evidence that the organisation\u201fs current strategic direction was \nfailing and the management team were experiencing difficulty in developing \nacceptable, alternative strategies. Although it was apparent that the Beta Co.  \norganization had strong competencies underpinning its existing business idea, or \nrecipe for success, it was equally apparent that there was no longer alignment \nbetween this recipe and the requirements of a changing environment. Quotations \nfrom the management team interview data collected were categorized under Janis \nand Mann\u201fs headings. \n The following exemplar quotations illustrate that the management team perceived the \nrisks to be serious if the organization failed to change its current strategy: \n \n The business needs more income streams . . . therefore, diversification is crucial \nnow to build significant other income streams. (Participant I) \n \n A key danger is that there is too much emphasis on our core business activity . . . \nNew technology could result in the death of [Beta Co\u201fs main offering] by 2005, \n2010, 2015.  Who knows when?  We need to move to new areas that will result in \nnew revenue streams . . . The failure of [Beta Co] to develop alternative revenue \nstreams would be another bad scenario. (Participant 2) \n \n If we go on as we are, in 10 years from now we won\u201ft be here. (Participant 3) \n \n There is a perception around here that [Beta Co] has very much got all its eggs \ntogether in one basket.  If one of [Beta Co\u201fs major customers] pulled out . . . At a \npersonal level, I am very much concerned that we have job security. (Participant \n5) \n \nAt the same time, the risks were also perceived to be serious if the organization did \nchange its strategy, as is illustrated by the following quotations: \n \n We are a group of talented amateurs rather than experienced in areas of \npotential diversification. (Participant 4) \n \n [Beta\u201fs latest experimental venture] has been a protracted and salutary \nexperience. There are very few short-term gains to be made. (Participant 6) \n \n We are na\u00efve on the business side [Beta Co\u201fs latest  experiment venture] is \nnecessary for our future, but we have had a slightly unrealistic view of how easy \nor difficult it would be to break into an existing market in which potential \ncustomers have settled relationships and [Beta Co] has no track record. \n(Participant 7) \n \nIt was also clear, as evidenced from the quotations below, that the senior \nmanagement team was also attempting to shift responsibility (i.e. \u201epassing the buck\u201f) \nto the board of directors of the company for adhering to a strategy that was obviously \nfailing: \n \n Our main board director is on the record as having said that [Beta Co] should \nmake an attempt to adapt to changing market conditions. (Participant 1) \n \n The board faces a key decision, not us. They need to take a keen interest in \nterms of what shape  [Beta Co] should take in the future. (Participant 3) \n \n We have to try and resolve the diversification issue one way or the other, but I am \nnot sure that this is a decision we can take. (Participant 7) \n \nEqually, there was also compelling evidence of delay and procrastination amongst \nthe management team, as demonstrated by the following quotations: \n \n The failure to diversify would probably mean the business would still be OK in 10 \nyears from now, but after 15 years it would be starting to decline. (Participant 1) \n \n There is still mileage in [Beta Co\u201fs offering] for the next 10 years. (Participant 5) \n \n Things will be slower than most people think . . . We are 20 years away from \ncomplete change i.e. our business will still be serviceable in 20 years\u201f time.  \n(Participant 6) \n \n There is no real rush to adapt . . 5 to 10 years away there will still be a healthy \nmarket for [Beta Co\u201fs main offering]. (Participant 7) \n \nFinally, there was evidence of bolstering the current failing strategy: \n \n The slow part of change in our industry is of benefit to us . . . if [Beta Co] \nbecomes the only [provider of its current main offering] there will be less pressure \non us to develop other products . . . [Beta Co\u201fs] current performance and historic \nrecord are its key strength. (Participant 2) \n \n One of the problems we face in respect of new product is customer inertia . . . \nCustomers are generally conservative because they don\u201ft want the hassle of \nchanging (suppliers).  These same forces are potentially prolonging the life of \n[Beta Co\u201fs current main offering] . . . within the next 2 to 3 years. (Participant 2) \n \n Ultimately, I was brought in [to Beta Co] to play a key role in enabling the \norganization to diversify and\/or add to its core business, though diversification \nmay not be needed if [Beta Co.] becomes [the major player within the market of \nits current main offering] within the next 2 to 3 years. [Participant 2) \n \nTo summarise to this point: the company\u201fs strategy was failing and the management \nteam were having difficulty developing a new strategy; they were aware that failure to \nchange the strategy, i.e. \u201edo nothing\u201f, was a high risk option but, equally, perceived \nrisks in making changes; and evidence of all three defensive avoidance behaviours \n(buck passing, procrastination and bolstering) were present.  \nAt the same time, the following quotations indicate that in addition to the above, there \nwas clearly a deficiency in terms of information search and contingency planning.  \n \n I believe you can always buy the skill you need. You may have to pay a bit more \nor wait a bit. (Participant 1) \n \n We don\u201ft know enough about the real strategic aims of [Beta Co\u201fs main \ncustomers]. (Participant 4) \n \n We lack understanding of real customer requirements . . . We know even less \nabout potential customers. (Participant 4) \n \n There is a learning process we need to go through, but I am sure we can do it \nand beat the competition. (Participant 5) \n \n Another key requirement is for investment in R&D to secure  the organization\u201fs \nfuture through the creation of new revenue streams, but how should this be \ndone? (Participant 2) \n \n I guess we ought to be doing other things to protect ourselves. (Participant 5) \n \nHodgkinson and Wright [1] concluded that the subsequent scenario planning \nexercise put the nature of the future into sharp focus for Beta Co. It revealed that \nseveral technological changes, regarded by the participants as predetermined factors \nrather than critical uncertainties, would eventually replace the company\u201fs main \noffering. Unfortunately none of the strategic alternatives devised by the participants \nwere robust against the range of futures constructed in the scenarios and, \nessentially, the company could only continue with its current strategy. Consequently, \nthis scenario exercise was considered an unsuccessful intervention. According to the \nJanis and Mann model, if an appropriate alternative strategy cannot be devised, \nunconflicted change is not possible; in such a situation the pre-intervention stress \nlevel rises further to an unacceptable level, and again, a range of psychological \ndefence mechanisms come into effect, ultimately inhibiting the change management \nprocess itself (cf. Argyris, [26]; Ginsberg, [27]; Kisfalvi, [18], Staw et al., [28]). This, \nwe contend, is precisely what happened in the Beta Co case - in that the scenario \nprocess served only to \u201erub salt into a wound\u201f that had been superficially healed by \nthe earlier enactment of psychological coping processes. \n \nAdditionally, the context in which this particular organization was embedded at the \ntime of the intervention may also have mitigated against Hodgkinson and Wright\u201fs \neffort to conduct a \u201esuccessful\u201f scenario intervention - in that the historical situation \nfacing Beta Co. closely accords with the conditions described by the punctuated \nequilibrium model of change (Romanelli and Tushman, [29]; Tushman and Anderson, \n[30]) i.e. long periods of small, incremental change, interrupted by much shorter \nperiods of discontinuous, radical change. \n \nHodgkinson and Wright argued that until further case analyses of the success and \nfailure of scenario exercises in a range of organisations are systematically \ndocumented, the ability to predict the appropriateness of scenario techniques as \nintervention in particular organizational contexts, must remain limited. In short, further \ncase analyses are necessary to enable us to understand organizational contexts that \nare differentially receptive to scenario interventions. The following case study \npresents such an analysis - in which a scenario intervention resulted in an \nunconflicted change of strategy, and is therefore regarded as a \u201esuccess\u201f. The focus \nof our investigation is on the causes of such unconflicted change.  \n \n \n3 OUR CASE INVESTIGATION \n \nThe first part of this section gives a brief outline of the case company and its pre-\nintervention business situation. The second part documents,(i) the beliefs and recipe \nof the case organization prior to the intervention and (ii), initial reactions to the \nchallenge to management thinking induced by the scenario intervention. In a final \nsection, we document the company\u201fs response to the challenges engendered by the \nscenario planning intervention. \n \n3.1 Background to the case \n \nThe company, CBC Co., is part of a privately owned company operating in the \n\u201edrinks\u201f industry, and its primary produce is brand name whisky. The parent \ncompany\u201fs principal role is the marketing and branding of the group\u201fs drinks products \nand it has cross shareholdings with two other well known producers of blended \nwhiskies and a whisky cask trader. The Group is located in premises in Glasgow and \nblending and bottling operations are conducted at this location along with the storage \nof bonded whisky. Additionally, CBC Co. acts as a bottling sub-contractor for other \nname brand whisky companies.    \n \nAt the time of the scenario intervention, the mission of CBC Co. was \u201eto provide a \nquality service in the blending, bottling and storage of scotch whisky and other spirits; \nto co-operate with our customers in assisting them to develop their brands; and to \nprovide a realistic return on the company\u201fs assets\u201f. The company\u201fs philosophy was \ncentred on three inter-related issues; \u201ecustomer satisfaction\u201f (everyone acts to satisfy \nthe agreed requirements of the customers); \u201econtinuous improvement\u201f (through a \nprocess of active involvement and personal development); and \u201econtribution\u201f \n(everyone contributes positively to the success of the business). As with the Beta Co \ncase documented in Hodgkinson and Wright [1], CBC Co. had a historical context of \nlong periods of incremental change interrupted by much shorter periods of \ndiscontinuous, radical change. \n \n3.2 Initial reactions to the scenario planning intervention \n \nAs will be demonstrated in this case, the management team of CBC Co. had, over \ntime, developed deeply held beliefs or \u201erecipes\u201f, regarding their organization, its \nproducts, and its interaction with customers. These recipes locked the management \nteam into behaving in particular ways which prevented them from understanding (i) \nthe obsolete assumptions and disabling features underlying the recipe, and (ii) the \nimportance of ongoing structural change in their contextual environment.  \n \nThe first workshop with the management team, based around the feedback of pre-\nintervention interviews of each of the individuals in the management team, enabled \nthem to reflect together in a way not previously experienced.  For example:  \n \n The weight of the data in the interview feedback is interesting, vulnerabilities are \nless than expected. (Participant 1) \n \n does that tell you anything? (Participant 2). \n \n healthy?...\u201cor complacency? (Participant 3) \n \nAt the second workshop, an informed outsider, or in the phraseology of scenario \nplanning, a \u201eremarkable person\u201f (RP), was brought in to question the received \nwisdom of the team, to introduce new ideas, concepts and examples and to generally \nact as a stimulus to challenge management beliefs and the organisational recipe. \nExamples of some of the challenges evoked during the workshop include: \n \n I never thought about this before \u2026 I am depressed, we are being stuffed by our \ncustomers, we are locked into the risk of customers. (Participant 1) \n \n CBC Co. gives value, creates value for others, why? CBC take a worthless \nproduct and create value in the process, for little reward. (Participant 2). [Here the \nparticipants were reflecting on their experience and considering the lack of scope \nCBC Co. has to plan production due to short time requests from customers, \nfollowing a presentation from the RP discussing value creation and the offering \nprovided by CBC Co.] \n \nThese challenges acted as a trigger to managerial reflection on past experiences and \ndecisions made by management, inquiry into the evolution of the industry and the key \nsuccess factor requirements for the industry, and recognition of the potential skills \ninadequacies within the organization. The process of inquiry and reflection allowed \nthe participants to surface their assumptions which, when taken with the third \nworkshop in the scenario intervention process (scenario building), facilitated the \nopening-up of the management thinking to new perspectives. Examples of this are \nreflected in the following quotations: \n \n Can we increase the margin on a case?  In the short term?  In the long term? \n(Participant 4) \n \n We can adopt a JIT approach, no price increase, price pressure on packaging, \nwe can use technology for efficiency (go quicker with fewer people) or flexibility \n(for filling changeovers). (Participant 3) \n \n Robotics in technology would lower costs. (Participant 5) \n \n Past investments in plant may not allow us to do that. (Participant 2). [Here, \nparticipants reflected on past investments in packaging plant during workshop 2 \nand coming to the conclusion that there had been an under-investment by CBC in \nthe past] \n \nIn essence, this process of inquiry and reflection not only allowed, but stimulated and \nencouraged members of the management team to question each other and the RP \nfor further insights about new concepts and ideas, and to consider the implications of \nthese for the organization and its future. For example: \n \n The consumer is the creator of value, no such thing as an end user; how do we \ncreate value for the customer?  You need to think in terms of you, the customer \nand the customer\u201fs customer; consider Benetton \u2013 what business are they in?  \nTextiles?  Fashion?  Fashion for the young woman market, what do they value to \nbe attractive?  How does Benetton create value and help them to be fashionable?  \nTheir shops capture sales information and this is part of the production process, \nso that Benetton captures trends in colours early and design products \naccordingly. (Participant 5) \n \n This is a challenge to my thinking, its not needs, but creating value, this has \nblown away my 10 years of previous experience. (Participant 6)  [Here, \nparticipants reflected on new concepts \u2013 customer value, customer\u201fs customer]. \n \nThroughout the process several decision dilemmas began to surface. Whereas in the \nHodgkinson and Wright case, the management team defensively avoided dilemmas \nrelated to the viability of the current business idea - by bolstering the current failing \nstrategy, by procrastination, and by buck passing responsibility for resolution of the \ndilemma - in the CBC Co. case, the decision dilemmas (focusing on efficiency versus \nflexibility and on customer teams and dedicated lines versus quick response) were \nopenly discussed and vigorously analysed, in depth, by the management team. \n \n \n \n \n3.3 Developing a broader conceptualisation of the contextual environment \n \nIn addition to inquiry and reflection on the current situation, the second and third \nworkshops in the scenario intervention process allowed the management team to \nidentify and consider uncertainties that, it was agreed, could potentially have a major \nimpact on the organization and its industry in the future. By identifying and examining \nthe environmental \u201edriving forces\u201f, the process allowed participants to explore how \nthese could evolve individually and in concert over the scenario horizon, to create a \nrange of plausible futures which went far beyond a simple extrapolation of the \npresent. Structural patterns begin to emerge as participants began to causally link \nfactors, previously regarded as inconsequential or not applicable within their domain, \nand developments by other organizations not previously recognised, both of which \nresulted in a new understanding and new insights. An example of this is evidenced in \nthe quotation below: \n \n With static demand, the distributor is all powerful, the distributor owns the \nconsumer, the whisky industry has accelerated this situation, other drivers in the \nwhole industry are creating a positive feedback loop of control for the distributor, \nthis will lead to one EU distributor, we are beginning to see a trend emerge, for \nexample, Intermarche taking over Thomson in France, the distributor is creating a \nmonopoly situation. (Participant 2). \n \nIn contrast to the Hodgkinson and Wright Beta Co. case - in which there was no \ncareful search for and subsequent use of information to develop contingency plans in \nthe face of challenges - in the CBC Co. case the process stimulated the management \nteam to re-consider the purpose and objectives of the organization, to analyse for \nfurther structural insights, and to use their new understanding to actively search for \n\u201econtrol\u201f in their context (cf Hodgkinson, [31]). For example, part of the \u201enew \nunderstanding\u201f was that the CBC Co. management team came to the realisation that \nthe current configuration of operational activities resulted in the company absorbing \nsuppliers\u201f and customers\u201f risk. Supplier risk arose from CBC Co. holding, and paying \nfor, large stocks of empty bottles, labels, packages and bottle caps. Customer risk \nmeanwhile revolved around the fact that customers were requesting orders at short \nnotice and, to accommodate these, CBC Co. had to regularly amend production \nschedules, significantly increasing their operating costs. As a consequence, the \nmanagement team developed a new conceptualisation about the supplier and \ncustomer interaction and risk, and the need to do something about - this can be seen \nfrom the following quotation: \n \n We have been out-manoeuvred by our customers, we need to respond to that, \nand also think about the relationship between CBC Co., customers and suppliers \nto enable us to manage customers. (Participant 2) [One participant linking \nknowledge about the business, insights from the scenarios and past customer \nbehaviour as CBC Co. considered responses to the re-design of the organisation \nin the future.] \n \nThere was a realisation within the team that the industry structure had moved from \nthree tiers (raw materials, blending and bottling, and brand management) to two tiers \n(production and customer relationships). CBC Co. had almost no involvement with \nexternal customers and therefore no intelligence about market demand. This lack of \ninvolvement resulted in little internal understanding of the relationship between the \nbrand and customers, and CBC Co\u201fs role in that relationship. Production planning \nand scheduling would continue to be problematic under these circumstances as \norders taken on at short notice, acted to increase internal production complexity. \nFlexibility, previously regarded by CBC Co. as their competitive advantage, now \nappeared to be a major weakness. \n \n3.4 Search for response \n \nThe dual threat of supplier and customer risk, and lack of market intelligence required \nCBC Co. to identify and develop strategic responses. The response that emerged \nfrom the management team\u201fs analysis and deliberations was that CBC Co should \ntake the role of \u201csupply division\u201d for the parent company.  This role would give CBC \nsupply chain control, using \u201cIT for customer service through order visibility (value)\u201d \nand \u201cIT providing on line, real time enquiry for customers (new routines for \nrelationships and market intelligence)\u201d. These would require the group to henceforth \nconcentrate supply responsibility with CBC Co. including \u201credefining operational \nactivities for supply chain control and enhanced customer service\u201d and \u201cdeveloping \nEDI\/IT systems for order to delivery processes\u201d. In an interview conducted some \neighteen months after the scenario intervention, the Director of Whisky operations \nreflected, \u201c We made a presentation to the (Group Board) about the outcome of the \nscenario exercise and made the point that CBC could not really develop further\u2026 \nwithout getting more control over the process \u2013 total production, control over the \nways orders come in to us, and the way we process them\u2026 we moved from being an \nindependent bottler to being the supply chain management unit for the whole group\u201d. \n \n3.5    Summary of our inferences from the case analysis \n \nThe outcome of this scenario intervention was a severe challenge to managers\u201f \nbeliefs and experience, and our empirical findings highlight a pro-active and vigilant, \nmanagerial response to the new structural insights arrived at through the \nintervention. Prior to the intervention, the case study organization had not explicitly \narticulated any major concern(s) regarding the contextual environment and had \nindicated that the key managerial issue was simply the desire for a growth in bottling \nof 25%. At the conclusion of the intervention, the response being formulated had \nmoved from an initial concern with efficiency in operational production systems, to \ndeveloping an end-to-end supply system utilising information technology to allow \norder tracking in real time.  \n \nWe infer that the scenario process can, in the appropriate circumstances, act as an \nexternal \u201ejolt\u201f to the organization \u2013 a jolt which can bring about a re-conceptualisation \nof the organization\u201fs business idea or recipe for success. In the CBC Co. case, the \noriginal recipe entered a state of flux, eventually resulting in a transition as a result of \nthe search for a position of control in the industry, itself re-conceptualised. In short, \nthe participants from CBC co. undertook a redesign of organizational purpose that \nappears likely to enhance the prospects of the organization\u201fs survival in the futures \nencapsulated in the scenarios developed by the management team. \n \nTable 1, below, summarises the main stages of the scenario process intervention in \nCBC Co. and provides a stage-by-stage summary of the conclusions of our case \nanalysis. \n \n \n \n------------------------------------------------------------------ \nINSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE \n------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \nThe question which arises is: why were the decision avoidance processes described \nin Hodgkinson and Wright [1] not invoked in response to the organizational \u201ejolt\u201f in the \nCBC. Co. scenario planning intervention?  We conjecture that the answer to this \nquestion can be found in application of Janis and Mann\u201fs theoretical model.  We next \nturn to apply the Janis and Mann analysis to the pre-intervention interview responses \nin the CBC case. \n \n3.6 Case Analysis: Methodological Approach \n \nIn the CBC Co. case, we adopted the same methodology as that documented in \nHodgkinson and Wright [1]. Our aim was to illuminate which, if any of Janis and \nMann\u201fs psychological coping patterns could be identified in the thirty-two pages of \nsingle-spaced - typed interview data which we accumulated in the pre-intervention \ninterviews of the six members of the CBC Co. senior management team.  \n \nThe \u201ctrigger\u201d questions used to elicit information from those interviewed in CBC Co. \nare given in Table 2. These are the identical questions as those used by Hodgkinson \nand Wright and are known, in the scenario literature, as the \u201e7 Questions\u201f (van der \nHeijden, [5]). Accordingly, the interview responses from the Beta Co. and CBC Co. \ncases are directly comparable. \n \nOur interviews were undertaken with CBC Co.\u201fs managing director, finance director, \nHR director, operations director, operations manager and quality manager.  One \nparticipant, participant 4, whose interview quotations are given in Section 4.2, above, \njoined CBC Co. part-way through the process and so did not contribute to our pre-\nintervention interview records. \n \n------------------------------------------------ \nINSERT TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE \n------------------------------------------------ \n \nIn order to facilitate analysis and interpretation of the interview transcripts we used an \na priori scheme comprising 13 categories, which collectively embrace the full range \nof concepts employed within the Janis and Mann conflict theory of decision making \n(Hodgkinson and Wright, [1]).  An additional miscellaneous category was added to \nthe coding scheme to allow for the possibility that none of the categories derived from \nthis theory were applicable. The coding scheme is presented in full in Table 3. \n \n--------------------------------------------------- \nINSERT TABLE 3 ABOUT HERE \n--------------------------------------------------- \n \nInitially, the researchers read through the set of original interview transcripts and \nhighlighted interviewee responses, or \u201equotations\u201f, that were, plausibly, illustrations of \nthe various aspects of Janis and Mann\u201fs theory. The highlighted responses were \nthen allocated to one of the 13+1 a priori categories as considered appropriate, any \ndisagreement between the researchers as to category allocation being resolved \nthrough discussion. \nTo the best of our knowledge our analysis of the interview transcripts was \nexhaustive. However in order to ensure that we had not inadvertently overlooked any \nmaterial of potential relevance, we explained the Janis and Mann theory to two post-\ngraduate research assistants. They were then given  a copy of the categories shown \nin Table 2, and instructed to independently:  \n \n\u201c\u2026 read through each of the 6 interview transcripts and indicate any additional \nphrases, sentences or paragraphs that you believe could be plausibly allocated to \nany of the 14 categories (you are not required to actually allocate them, merely to \nindicate which phrase\/sentence\/paragraph deals with decisional issues that could \nbe categorised into one or more of the 14 categories).\u201d \n \nAs expected, the research assistants identified very few additional quotations.  \n \nThe analysis in the CBC Co. case was based on a total of 84 quotations identified \nthrough this exercise. The total population of quotations was 576.  In the text of this \npaper, we selectively allocate the 84 quotations in order to illustrate those aspects of \nJanis and Mann\u201fs theory that we believe are identified within the dataset. Our \ninterpretation is necessarily subjective, However, given that all 84 quotations are \ndocumented across the Tables attached to this paper, readers are in a position to \nreflect on the extent to which they agree or disagree with our account of the data. \n \n3.7 Findings \n \nThe following sections examine the application of the Janis and Mann model to the \ninterview data. \n \n3.7.1 Are the risks serious if CBC keeps to its current strategy? \n \nThe answer to this question was \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d. \u201cYes\u201d, as illustrated by the following \nremark: \n \n We are not concerned enough about diversifying. We have grown, doubled over \nthe last 10 years. Maybe that has made us less concerned with the risk in our \nsituation. Everything depends on the solid 2 brands we look after. (Participant 3) \n \nAnd \u201cNo\u201d, as illustrated by this remark: \n \n There is a lot of turbulence in the industry, things are happening, some \ncompanies are in a mess but we are in a good position. (Participant 7) \n \nFurther quotations supporting these conclusions are detailed in Tables 4 and 5. The \ninitial issue of concern to the participants was clearly that of the strength of CBC Co\u201fs \nposition in the whisky bottling business. On the one hand, the loss of one of the two \nmain brands currently being bottled by CBC Co. would be a major issue; on the other \nhand, the efficiency and cost effectiveness of CBC Co\u201fs bottling operation was seen \nas a major strength - a competitive advantage in terms of attracting new customers. \n --------------------------------------------------------- \nINSERT TABLES 4 AND 5 ABOUT HERE \n---------------------------------------------------------- \n \n3.7.2   Is it realistic to hope to find a better solution to CBC\u2019s current \nstrategic dilemma? \n \nThe answer to this question was an unequivocal \u201cyes\u201d. The following quotation \nillustrated this: \n \n If we manage to improve efficiency and maintain the (positive) atmosphere in the \nplant e.g. by improved rewards, and fewer but more highly skilled people, I see \nno reason why we could not move up to 10 million cases through-put.  And it \ncould be done on the same site. (Participant 6). \nTable 6 sets out other comments on this issue, whilst Table 7 sets out the sole \ncomment indicating that the potential market in bottling whisky for export may be \nlimited. \n \n---------------------------------------------------- \nINSERT TABLES 6 & 7 ABOUT HERE \n---------------------------------------------------- \n \n \n3.7.3 Shifting responsibility, procrastination and bolstering \n \nThere was some evidence that members of the CBC Co management team were \nattempting to shift the responsibility for any change in strategy, as evidenced by the \nfollowing quotation: \n \n The parent company is a \u201ewhisky firm\u201f, that is, where they make their money. A \nproposal form CBC Co. to invest in a big way in other drinks would have a hard \ntime. (Participant 1) \n \nFurther quotations providing evidence of shifting responsibility, are given in Table 8, \nbelow. However, note that since CBC is part of a privately-owned company it may, in \nreality, be unable to make strategic decisions in certain areas independently of the \nparent company. \n \n-------------------------------------------------- \nINSERT TABLE 8 ABOUT HERE \n-------------------------------------------------- \n \nEven though there was some evidence of other defensive avoidance behaviour \npatterns, only a small percentage of quotations were classified under the categories \nof procrastination and bolstering failing strategy (Tables 9 and 10), relative to a larger \nproportion of quotations evidencing limited information search and limited forward \nplanning for contingencies, as detailed in Table 11. \n-------------------------------------------------------------- \nINSERT TABLES 9, 10 and 11 ABOUT HERE \n-------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION \n \nThis paper has presented a case analysis of a company that reacted \u201cface-on\u201d to the \nperceived environmental threats provoked by a scenario planning intervention. We \ncontend that such rethinking is an appropriate, vigilant, response to the \u201ejolt\u201f of a \nscenario thinking intervention. The evidence for prior procrastination, bolstering, and \nbuck passing was slight in the present case when compared to the Hodgkinson & \nWright [1] Beta Co. case. Table 12 sets out the proportion of quotations that were \naccumulated under each of Janis & Mann\u201fs headings in the present case and \ncompares the proportions obtained to those obtained in the Hodgkinson & Wright \ncase. \n \n--------------------------------------------- \nINSERT TABLE 12 ABOUT HERE \n--------------------------------------------- \n \nInspection of Table 12 reveals that participants in the current case felt that the risks \nwere not serious if the organization kept to its current strategy but there was \nappreciation of the risks inherent in this strategy (rows 3 and 1).  There was also little \nevidence of the close analysis of alternative strategies (rows 2, 4, 5, and 6). There \nwas, however, evidence of hopes to find a better strategy (row 7). Overall, 13% of the \nquotations in the present case indicated procrastination, buck-passing, or bolstering \nbehaviour compared to 33% in Hodgkinson and Wright\u201fs case (rows 9, 10 and 11).  \nImportantly, in the latter case, there was no evidence that Beta Co. believed that their \ncurrent strategy was risk free (row 3) \n \nIn light of the above evidence, we contend that in the Hodgkinson and Wright case, \nthe organization had, prior to the scenario intervention, become disabled as a \nconsequence of the stresses engendered by a decision dilemma (rows 1 and 2, \ntaken together and contrasted with row 3) and that this resulted in the activation of \ncoping behaviours underpinning decision avoidance (rows 8, 9, 10 and 11) and \nsubsequent poor information search and contingency planning (row 12). By way of \ncontrast, the CBC Co. case evidenced little decision avoidance behaviour (rows 8, 9, \n10 and 11), since the risks of the current strategy were seen to be lower (row 3 \ncontrasted with row 1).   \n \nWhat are the implications of our case analysis? We suggest that the initial set of \ninterviews with a client organization, using the seven \u201ctrigger\u201d questions detailed in \nTable 2, can be used to diagnose the receptiveness of the organisation to scenario \nthinking. If the management team\u201fs responses to these questions evidence a similar \npattern to that of Beta Co., then we contend that this pattern is indicative of a \npredisposition to defensive avoidance behavior when confronted with a decision \ndilemma. In such a case, a typical scenario planning intervention is unlikely to result \nin success, as measured in terms of the management team\u201fs willingness to engage \nin a vigilant debate on the appropriateness of the alignment between the \norganisation\u201fs strategy and the demands of the environment. By contrast, a pattern of \nresponses similar to that seen in the CBC Co. case is indicative of a management \nteam in which a decision dilemma has not been recognised and the psychological \ncoping patterns inherent in defensive avoidance have not been activated, thereby \nincreasing the potential for a successful scenario intervention exercise.  \n \nAlthough there is in general, a paucity of research in the area of scenarios, research \nthat has been conducted has tended to concentrate on scenario processes and \ncontent, and a number \u201epitfalls\u201f have been described in these arenas (Schoemaker, \n[23]). The significance of the present piece of research is that it takes a step back \nand offers a well-known model from laboratory-based decision research, which can \nbe used to identify the pre-existing conditions within an organisational management \nteam that may determine the likelihood of the success of a scenario intervention - at \nthe outset of that intervention.  \n \nIf the results of this research are indeed generalisable, then the impact on scenario \nplanning practitioners cannot be overstated. Although the management team of an \norganisation may claim to want to engage in a scenario planning intervention in an \nattempt to examine and debate the alignment of the organisation\u201fs strategy, as in \nHodgkinson and Wright\u201fs case analysis, practitioners can, with reasonable \nconfidence, determine at the outset whether or not the espoused desire coincides \nwith the actual receptiveness of the organizational context - as revealed by the \napplication of the Janis and Mann model to the pre-intervention interview data \nyielded by the management team. With this information, the reflective practitioner is \nthen in a position to make a contingent decision as to the best way to proceed, or \nnot, with the scenario exercise.  Thus, in keeping with recent calls for researchers to \nmake management theory more relevant to the world of practice, this paper has \nbegun to establish a contingency model of the signs that would indicate a receptive \nor non-receptive intra-organizational context for a scenario-based intervention. \n \nWe note, however, that the two cases that we have compared and contrasted will \ndiffer in other significant ways than those that we studied - for example, in terms of \nteam leadership, team dynamics, and team structure. Other differences may be \nthose of organizational competence, organizational power (over the business \nenvironment), and organizational architecture. Clearly, the present study is one that \nenables theory building \u2013 an initial transfer of knowledge from the psychological \nlaboratory to the organizational setting \u2013 rather than providing a rigorous testing of \ntheory in controlled conditions. \n \nWe conclude that the ability of an organization to overcome strategic inertia can be \npsychological. As we have reviewed, the extant literature on the causes of strategic \ninertia is sparse and it is silent on psychological causation.

The individual believes the risks are serious if the organization  \n  keeps to its current strategy. \n \n \n\u201cOur current position is that we have the right equipment, but not the right calibre of \npeople\u201d (Participant 2) \n \n \u201cOur fate is with the 2 main Brands. If anything happens to them we would collapse.  \nThings do happen though, remember the Perrier event.  Or it could be a more gradual \nprocess, e.g. due to a price war.\u201d (Participant 1) \n \n\u201cThe main threat would be to lose one of our main brands.\u201d (Participant 7) \n \n\u201cThe main uncertainties relate to the 2 main brands handled here.  Will they continue \nto perform in the market?  Problems could arise around market demand, or with \naccess to the distribution chain.\u201d (Participant 3) \n \n\u201cAlthough we consider our business across all spirits, 98% of what we do is whisky.  \nAnd in that we are dependent on two major customers. (Participant 6) \n \n\u201cWe have got to spread our risk wider, and acquire major new brand customers.  We \nare getting into small things at the moment, but no success yet with a really big new \ncustomer.\u201d (Participant 3) \n \n\u201cCBC are highly dependent on volume.  With high fixed cost and low variable costs \nour break even point is rather high.\u201d (Participant 2) \n \n\u201cDevelopments in the price levels in the whisky market are problematic.  Own label \nbrands in supermarkets are putting pressure on margins, of which we can feel the \neffect in our negotiations with customers.  For example, our prices to customers have \nnot been increased since three years.\u201d (Participant 2) \n \n\u201cWe try to give a premium service, and on the whole we succeed in this.  But there is \nnot a lot of scope for a premium price.  Our price has to be competitive.  The cost of  \nthe service is the main issue for our customers (particularly the bigger once).\u201d \n(Participant 2) \n \n\u201cThe fighting brands could destroy the main brands.  As we depend on two of these \nfor our survival, we are walking a tightrope here, supporting our brands, as well as \nbeing ready to jump into the new market as it comes.\u201d (Participant 1) \n \n\u201cA development which might affect the whisky market could be the development of a \nwholly new drink.  The younger part of the population might be attracted to \nsomething new.  Bells are putting out new drinks.\u201d (Participant 1) \n \n\u201cThrough our high investment level our break-even is high.  We could not lose one \nmillion cases and stay in the black.\u201d (Participant 6) \n \n\u201cTwo eggs in our basket are not enough.  We could not survive the loss of one of the \nmain brands.\u201d (Participant 1) \n \u201cDue to our flexibility investments the break-even point has increased from 2.5 \nmillion cases to 4 million.  This means that if we lose one of the main brands we \nwould be below break-even.  If you consider what happened to Cutty Sark in the US \nyou have to come to the conclusions that this is by no means impossible.  A \u201fhealth \nwarning\u201f.\u201d (Participant 7) \n \n\u201cFinding the right team leaders is the crux of our performance.  It is a serious \nproblem area.  Our policies, such as promotion from within, have not helped.  It has \nput a cap on the level of achievement.\u201d (Participant 6) \n \n\u201cWhat is going to happen with the perceived value of brands?  Whisky could become \nmuch more of a commodity.  This would create intense pressure on profitability.  One \ncan imagine a situation where CBC could not survive.\u201d (Participant 2) \n \n\u201cThe developments around unbranded whisky are worrying, because of the pressure \non prices it causes.  This could even eventually kill off brands.\u201d (Participant 7) \n \n\u201cI am concerned that Europe are pricing themselves out of the market with our wage \nrates.  There is no way we can compete with India or China.\u201d (Participant 3) \n \n \nTable 5. The individual believes the risks are not serious if the organization \n  keeps to its current strategy. \n \n \n\u201cThe EU protocol seems to bring bottling back to the country or origin.  Sherry is \nnow increasingly bottled in Spain, and whisky has come back to Scotland.\u201d \n(Participant 3) \n \n\u201cThe smaller companies now have little alternative.  MacDuff, who is selling 200K \ncases in principle could do the bottling themselves, but it would be expensive.  They \nwould have to overcome a big hurdle.\u201d (Participant 2) \n \n\u201cWhat we are looking for are new customers who will do all their bottling with us.  \nWe have gained one such customer.  The take-over of William Muir by Whyte & \nMackay may provide new opportunities.\u201d (Participant 2) \n \n\u201cWilliam Muir has now been renamed Whyte & Mackay Bottling.  This will scare off \nthird party customers, who do not like to contribute to the overheads of a brand \ncompetitor.  CBC is independent, not owned by a brand.\u201d (Participant 5) \n \n\u201cMost of our clients come to us for mainly historical reasons.  In this business the \ncrux is \u201eword of mouth\u201f.  People need to know who you are.\u201d (Participant 7) \n \n\u201cMy optimistic scenario is another 1M cases over what we are doing now.  We will \nhave invested in another 3 fully automatic lines, and we have still to build a new hall \nand warehouse.\u201d (Participant 3) \n \n\u201cHighland Distillers could be subject to a hostile take-over bid.  They are a public \ncompany.  It would be resisted, but who can tell?  If it happened we should try to turn \nit into an opportunity, by acquiring new bottling business from the new owner.\u201d \n(Participant 6) \n \n\u201cOur investments are geared towards our existing business, both quality and \nthroughput.  It is not intended to serve major new business opportunities.\u201d \n(Participant 6) \n \n\u201cOur facilities are the key.  We must continue to spend on them.\u201d (Participant 7) \n \n\u201cWe will reach the stage where only a few multi-nationals will be left in the industry.  \nMaybe at that time some sense can return in the market place.\u201d (Participant 6) \n \n \u201cThe 4 or 5 large players in whisky have their own bottling.  But they may be looking \nat it as a cost, and may be interested in rationalisation.  That would give us a chance.  \nAt other times they think they must be in it, for reasons of control, marketing and \nscale.\u201d (Participant 7) \n \n\u201cThe name of the game is the lowest possible cost per case.\u201d (Participant 3) \n \n\u201cThe CBC part of the strategy is to take on more and more business.  We are doing \nthis in a stagnant to declining market.  Even so, we see further opportunities.\u201d \nParticipant 3) \n \n\u201cThe challenge is now to pick up another big player, who would bottle one or a \ncouple of million cases with us.\u201d (Participant 7) \n \n\u201cI would not be surprised if in the not too distant future we would suddenly have the \nopportunity to acquire a very large contract.  There is a lot of turbulence in the \nindustry, things are happening, some companies are in a mess, but we are in a good \nposition.  I am not sure anyone is doing anything about this.\u201d (Participant 6) \n \n\u201cApart from William Muir there are two other independent bottlers, but they have a \n\u201eback street\u201f image in the industry.  They do not provide a good finish to their service.  \nThey are also smaller, typically one million cases against our 5.\u201d (Participant 2) \n \n\u201cFlexibility is the main reason why customers come to us.  We take the hassle out of \ntheir operation.\u201d (Participant 2) \n \n\u201cThe key business issue is getting the efficiency up.\u201d (Participant 2) \n \n\u201cA major selling point in our favour: We are independent from any brand.  Therefore \nwe are not seen as a potential competitor.  Many companies will not deal with \ncompetitors.\u201d (Participant 7) \n \n\u201cThe big customers are all in the process of rationalisation of their facilities.  This \ncreates overflows for which they have to go outside.  The bigger the company, the \nbigger the bits that are outsourced.  This can lead to worthwhile contracts, as large \nas 50K cases.\u201d (Participant 3) \n \n\u201cWe are not entirely sure what is standing in the way of higher line efficiencies.  We \nhave launched process measurements initiatives to find out.  Many factors are \nimpinging on this.  The reasons for stoppages can be many.\u201d (Participant 6) \n \n\u201cBottling in Scotland is now becoming a brand feature.  \u201eBottled in Scotland\u201f is \nprinted on the label.\u201d (Participant 6) \n \n\u201cThe main constraint to expanding our business is the demand for the type of services \nwe offer.\u201d (Participant 7) \n \n\u201cUntied Distillers have rationalised their bottling from 7 to 4 plants.  They want to \nget rid of irregular business.  But I am not sure whether they are a willing partner yet.  \nIt is an evolutionary process.\u201d (Participant 3) \n \n\u201cThe CBC part of the strategy is to take on more and more business.  We are dong \nthis in a stagnant declining market.  Even so, we see further opportunities.\u201d \n(Participant 3) \n \n\u201cOur distinctive competence is in bottling whiskey.  We have no competence for \nfilling water.  Other spirits will remain a side line.\u201d (Participant 3) \n \u201cWe have been installing new equipment consistently over the last 10 years.  There \nstill is some way to go.\u201d (Participant 3) \n \n\u201cThe whisky market in the UK is declining, but exports are up.  Grouse export one \nmillion cases, all Cutty Sark production is exported.\u201d (Participant 6) \n \n\u201cWe are now quoting for contracts from people like United Distillers and J&B.  It is a \nnew developing scene for us.  It will take time to build up.  We have not got there yet.\u201d \n(Participant 3) \n \n\u201cOne could have a vision of one big blending and bottling operation serving the \nwhole of the Scotch whisky industry.  An operation so efficient and flexible, that no-\none wants to do it for themselves any more.\u201d (Participant 2) \n \n\u201cI think the future is in more machines and less people.  It is certainly the present \ntrend.\u201d (Participant 7) \n \n\u201cThere are not many companies like CBC, just in storage, blending and bottling.  The \none serious competitor, William Muir, has been taken over by Whyte & MacKay and \nmay be pulling out of third party bottling.  It may offer a significant opportunity for \nCBC.\u201d (Participant 2) \n \n\u201cOne of our two main customers could be taken over, and their bottling could go \nelsewhere.  On the other hand our group could take over another company, and do \nthe reverse.\u201d (Participant 6) \n \n \n \nTable 6. The individual believes that it is realistic to hope to find a better \n  strategy to replace the one currently being followed. \n \n \n\u201cIf we think in terms of expansion we have got to get much better at it.  The bottleneck \nis that we do not have enough quality people.  The problem is that this industry has \ntraditionally been a cradle-to-grave employer, with little flexibility.  Now we need a \ndifferent competence level.  Particularly in the junior to middle management area.\u201d \n(Participant 1) \n \n \u201cOver the last 5 years we have made major progress in getting people involved.  It is \nvery gratifying to see relatively uneducated people stand up and talk about their job.  \nPeople are also starting to realise that there is value in education, acquiring the \nability to contribute to the business.\u201d (Participant 3) \n \n \u201cThe 10 million cases future would consist of some generic growth in the existing \nbusiness, new brands, other spirits (vodka?), or even some unbranded whisky.\u201d \n(Participant 7) \n \n\u201cOur new business plans require that we go outside the existing pool of people.  It \nmeans that some others will have to go.  We are the only business these people know.  \nThis is hard as it is our fault that this situation has arisen.\u201d (Participant 1) \n \n\u201cMaybe our main constraint to lower cost and improved product is our own \nmanagerial thinking.  The ability to lead and carry things through.  We have got to \ndevelop good leaders.  The work force is probably as good as any, but traditional \nmanagement is the limitation.\u201d (Participant 2) \n \n\u201cThere is no reason why we should not grow to 10M cases, 5 or 6 from the main \nbrands and the rest from 1M contracts and some small stuff.  We could do that in our \ncurrent facilities, possibly with the addition of a third bottling hall.\u201d (Participant 5) \n \n\u201cCBC has enormous potential, due to facilities and people available.  We are not yet \nquite there.  First resolve the internal problems, and don\u201ft go too far before these \nhave been resolved and we are ready.  For example, line efficiencies must first go \nup.\u201d (Participant 7) \n \n \n \n \nTable 7. The individual believes that it is unrealistic to hope to find a better \n  strategy to replace the one currently being followed. \n \n \n\u201cThere are huge potential markets for whisky in countries such as India and China.  \nBut due to low labour cost they do their own bottling.  This business therefore \nbypasses CBC. (Participant 2)  \n \nTable 8. The individual (or wider organizations) is shifting the   \n  responsibility for making a strategic choice to another individual \n  or group of individuals \n \n \n\u201cThe big strategic decisions require the benefit of the vertical integration of the \ngroup.  We cannot do it on our own.\u201d (Participant 6) \n \n\u201cWe are supplying own labels to supermarkets in France.  There is a lot of potential \nexpansion in business of this type.  It could be a template for the future.  But we \ndepend on R&B to bring in these customers.\u201d (Participant 7) \n \n\u201cHow do we want to grow the business?  We have the \u201eamber light\u201f for growth, not \nthe \u201egreen light\u201f yet, we have to make the case first.\u201d (Participant 2) \n \nOur main uncertainty is the thinking in the Edrington group.  The real decisions are \ntaken at board level, and some of us are not present there.  On the whole there are no \nsecrets, but that does not mean that everyone knows what they are working on.  We \nare not always able to influence the thinking.\u201d (Participant 6) \n \n\u201cIt is difficult to see how CBC could develop major overseas opportunities on its own.  \nSuch JV\u201fs would require the group\u201fs distribution capabilities.  Only thing we can do \nis assist\u201d. (Participant 6)  \n \n \n \n \nTable 9. The individual (or wider organizations) is delaying (or putting off) \n  making a strategic choice. \n \n \n\u201cWe are very slow off the mark.  For example, our JV in India followed just about \neveryone else.\u201d (Participant 1) \n \n\u201cWe have further plans for development of the company, but we need to triggers to \nget things moving.\u201d (Participant 2) \n \n \n \nTable 10. The individual (or wider organization) is engaged in exaggerating \n  the positive consequences (or minimising the negative   \n  consequences) of the current strategy. \n \n \n\u201cIn the 70\u201fs R&B bought a food company.  This proved a disaster.  The company has \nbeen disposed of.  But the memory lingers on.  This is one thing we will never do \nagain.  It is unlikely that the group will diversify from whisky.\u201d (Participant 5) \n \n\u201cAlthough we are not any longer a cost centre, we will continue to live with the \ndilemma that if we improve our efficiency our customers will expect a lower price.  \nThere is no other price standard to look at than our cost.  There is no \u201egoing market \nrate for the job\u201f.  Also we are very close to our customers.  We will therefore never be \nextraordinary profitable.  And we can prosper only under the protective arm of the \nGroup.\u201d (Participant 3) \n \n\u201cThe industry are looking for ways to reduce stocks and working capital, but at the \nsame time to increase variety and choice to the market.  If we find some magic \nformula here we have got it made.\u201d (Participant 2) \nTable 11. The quotation indicates either a) limited evaluation or available \n  information or b) limited planning for events that could happen. \n \n \n\u201cAlthough we say we are in spirits, I think the company would look at something else, \nif a really promising opportunity came about.  The company is cash-rich.\u201d \n(Participant 6) \n \n\u201cI wonder whether we should start thinking beyond spirits.\u201d (Participant 7) \n \n\u201cOur MD is also our sole marketing man.  This cannot be sufficient.  We need to \nbring in more business and new customers.\u201d (Participant 7) \n \n\u201cWe do not market research, we have traditionally left that to R&B and the brand \nowners.  This may have to change if we want to develop the business.\u201d (Participant 1) \n \n\u201cWhere is whisky going as a product?  The overall market is growing, due to new \nmarkets such as the FE, but the mature markets are declining.  What does that \nmean?\u201d (Participant 2) \n \n\u201cWe do not know who the potential overseas business partners are.  I trust someone \nin the group knows.\u201d (Participant 6) \n \n\u201cAs part of the Group empire CBC has been an inward looking insular company.  \nThe business came to us and we reacted.  The brands had the commercial contacts \noutside.\u201d (Participant 2) \n \n\u201cGrowth probably will have to come from a customer by customer approach, rather \nthan through one big conceptual leap.  The latter is difficult to envisage.\u201d \n(Participant 2) \n \n\u201cOver the last 5 years we have tried to become a bit more outward looking.\u201d \n(Participant 2) \n \n\u201cThere is hardly any financial constraint on what we do.  The problem is really to \nspend money wisely.  It is easy to get capital expenditure approval.  Too easy.\u201d \n(Participant 1) \n \n\u201cOur biggest underlying uncertainty is the future of the whisky market in general.  \nWhere is whisky going as a product?  The overall market is growing, due to new \nmarkets such as the FE, but the mature markets are declining.  What does that \nmean?\u201d (Participant 2) \n \n  \n  \n Description Hodgkinson \nand \nWright\u2019s \n(2002) case \nThe \npresent \ncase \n 1 The individual believes the risks are serious if the \norganization keeps to its current strategy. \n \n12% \n \n23% \n 2 The individual believes the risks are serious if the \norganization changes its current strategy. \n \n10% \n \n0% \n 3 The individual believes the risks are not serious if the \norganization keeps to its current strategy. \n \n0% \n \n40% \n 4 The individual believes the risks are not serious if the \norganization changes its current strategy. \n \n0% \n \n0% \n 5 The individual believes there is insufficient time to \nsearch for (and fully consider) a new strategy to \nreplace the current strategy. \n \n \n0% \n \n \n0% \n 6 The individual believes there is sufficient time to \nsearch for (and fully consider) a new strategy to \nreplace the current strategy. \n \n \n0% \n \n \n0% \n 7 The individual believes that it is realistic to hope to \nfind a better strategy to replace the one currently \nbeing followed. \n \n \n0% \n \n \n10% \n 8 The individual believes that it is unrealistic to hope \nto find a better strategy to replace the one currently \nbeing followed. \n \n \n16% \n \n \n1% \n 9 The individual (or wider organization) is delayed (or \nputting off) making a strategic choice. \n \n16% \n \n2% \n10 The individual (or wider organization) is shifting the \nresponsibility making a strategic choice to another \nindividual group of individuals. \n \n \n6% \n \n \n7% \n11 The individual (or wider organization) is engaged in \nexaggerating the positive consequence (or \nminimising the negative consequence ) of the current \nstrategy. \n \n \n \n11% \n \n \n \n4% \n12 The quotation indicates either a) limited evaluation \nof available information or b) limited planning for \nevents that could happen. \n \n \n29% \n \n \n13% \n13 The quotation indicates high quality strategic \ndecision making. \n \n0% \n \n0% \n \nTable 12: A comparison of the results of the present case with that of  \n  Hodgkinson and Wright\u2019s case analysis: percentage of quotations \n  sorted into each of the 13 categories of Janis and Mann\u2019s model. \n \nReferences \n \n[1] Hodgkinson, G.P., and G.Wright \n2002. \u201cConfronting Strategic inertia in a top management team: Learning from \nfailure.\u201d Organization Studies, 23: 949-977 \n \n[2] Janis, I.L., and L.
