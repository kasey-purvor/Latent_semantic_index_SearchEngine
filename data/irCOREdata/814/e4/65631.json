This debate has been \nfairly extensive in its, overwhelmingly negative, evaluation but it has ignored what is \narguably the most important aspect of the assessment of the typology: its robustness \nand validity over time. This paper provides such an assessment by presenting an \nupdated version of Esping-Andersen\u2019s decommodification index.  It compares the \nnew index with Esping-Andersen\u2019s original and uses it to judge both the continuing \nvalidity of the \u2018three worlds of welfare\u2019 and broader theories that have been circulated \nabout the convergence of welfare states.  \n \nIntroduction \nHow we classify welfare states has long been a central issue in comparative social \npolicy (Wilensky & Lebaux, 1958; Titmus, 1974; Therborn, 1987; Esping-Andersen, \n1990; Castles and Mitchell, 1993). Recently, the literature has been dominated by \nEsping-Andersen\u2019s \u2018three worlds of welfare\u2019 typology and the on-going intensive \nacademic debate that has surrounded it (Esping-Andersen, 1990; 1999; Lewis, 1992; \nLeibfreid, 1992; Castles & Mitchell, 1993; Orloff, 1993; Borchost, 1994; Daly, 1994; \nKangas, 1994; Ragin, 1994; Ferrera, 1996; Shalev, 1996; Bonoli, 1997; Albrahamson, \n1999; Goodin, 1999; Sainsbury, 1999; Pitruzzello, 1999; Arts and Gelissen, 2002; \nKasza, 2002; Bambra, 2004). His \u2018three worlds\u2019 thesis has been criticised from a \nvariety of angles: the range (Leibfreid, 1992; Castles & Mitchell, 1993; Ferrera, 1996; \n 2 \nBonoli, 1997), the methodology (Kangas, 1994; Ragin, 1994; Shalev, 1996; \nPitruzzello, 1999), the usefulness of the regime concept (Kasza, 2002), and the \nabsence of gender in the typology (Lewis, 1992; Orloff, 1993; Borchost, 1994; Daly, \n1994; Sainsbury, 1999). However, this barrage of overwhelmingly negative \ncommentary ignores and hides what is the most important aspect of the assessment of \nthe typology: its robustness and validity over time. \n  \nEsping-Andersen\u2019s typology was originally published in 1990, but the labour market \ndata upon which it was based was from 1980 (Esping-Andersen, 1990: 50). In the \ntime between then and now, welfare states have been subjected to a changed \nenvironment in which they experience significant pressures such as the globalization \nof national economies, high unemployment and low economic growth, and changes in \ndemographic structure (Esping-Andersen, 2000; Rhodes, 1997; Castles, 2002). It has \nbeen suggested that these pressures have resulted in a process of welfare state reform \nand retrenchment that has decreased the differences between types of welfare state \n(Boyer and Drache, 1996; Hirst and Thompson, 1996; Milner and Keohane, 1996; \nMishra, 1996; 1999; Rhodes, 1997) and the nature of the provision they offer: welfare \nstate convergence via a \u2018rush to the bottom\u2019 (Callinicos, 1994; Strange, 1996; Greider, \n1997; Martin and Schumann, 1997; Rodrik, 1997; Gray, 1998). It is theorised from \nthis position, that given these changes, Esping-Andersen\u2019s \u2018outdated\u2019 1980s typology \nof pre-globalization welfare states is no longer of any utility as it \u2018cannot be\u2019 robust \nover time. However, there is a competing position in the comparative social policy \nliterature that rejects the theoretical claims of convergence made by the globalization \nschool and suggests, largely through cross-national empirical analysis, that welfare \nstates have been relatively resilient over the last two decades and have thereby \n 3 \nmaintained their diversity (Pierson, 1994; 1996; 1998; 2001; Navarro, 1999; 2000; \nAlber and Standing, 2000; Esping-Andersen, 2000; Ferrera and Rhodes, 2000; \nKuhnle, 2000; Scharpf and Schmidt, 2000; Castles, 2001; Leibfreid, 2001; Huber and \nStephens, 2001; Taylor-Gooby, 2001; 2002). This approach suggests that Esping-\nAndersen\u2019s typology is likely to still be valid and that it has remained robust. \n \nThis paper will engage with both this debate and the one that has surrounded Esping-\nAndersen\u2019s typology by presenting an updated version of the labour market \ndecommodification index upon which the majority of Esping-Andersen\u2019s regimes \ntypology was based. This will be used to construct a new typology of welfare states \nwhich will be directly compared with Esping-Andersen\u2019s original. This will be used \nto test two hypotheses drawn from the debates in the literature as they apply to \nEsping-Andersen\u2019s typology of welfare states:  \n \n Hypothesis 1 - Convergence: the \u2018worlds of welfare\u2019 have begun to \ndisintegrate; Esping-Andersen\u2019s thesis has not been robust; and the \nglobalization thesis is given credence. \n \n Hypothesis 2 - Divergence: the \u2018worlds of welfare\u2019 have remained relatively \nunchanged; Esping-Andersen\u2019s thesis is robust and of continued value; and the \nassertions of globalization theorists are shown to be questionable. \n \nThe paper proceeds with a brief overview of Esping-Andersen\u2019s typology and the \ndebate that has emerged about it. It then presents the updated decommodification \nindex and the resulting typology. This is compared and contrasted with Esping-\n 4 \nAndersen\u2019s original and the paper concludes with a discussion of the changes and \ncontinuity between the two typologies in relation to the hypotheses and the debates \nabout welfare state regimes and the extent of welfare state change.  \n \nThe three \u2018worlds of welfare\u2019 \nIn 'The Three Worlds of welfare Capitalism' (1990: 2), Esping-Andersen argues that \n\u2018existing theoretical models of the welfare state are inadequate\u2019 as their analysis relies \ntoo heavily upon the misleading comparison of aggregate welfare state expenditure. \nThe focus on total expenditure figures conceals the variety of state approaches to \nwelfare; as \u2018even if the lion\u2019s share of expenditure or personnel serves welfare aims, \nthe kind of welfare provided will be qualitatively different, as will its prioritisation \nrelative to competing activities\u2019 (1990: 1). He asserts that it is therefore more \nbeneficial to focus upon what a welfare state does, rather than how much money it is \nafforded. On this basis, Esping-Andersen presents a typology of welfare states based \nupon the operationalization of three principles: decommodification which examines \nthe extent to which an individual\u2019s welfare is reliant upon the market, levels of social \nstratification which examines the role of welfare states in maintaining or breaking \ndown social stratification; and the private-public mix which focuses on the relative \nroles of the state, the family and the market in welfare provision. The application of \nthese principles via the creation of statistical indexes leads to the division of welfare \nstates into three regime types: liberal (UK, USA, Ireland, Canada, Australia), \nconservative (Germany, France, Austria, Benelux countries and Italy); and social \ndemocratic (Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden).  \n \n 5 \nIn the welfare states of the liberal regime (UK, USA, Ireland, Canada, Australia), state \nprovision of welfare is minimal, benefits are modest and often attract strict \nentitlement criteria; and recipients are usually means-tested and stigmatized (Esping-\nAndersen, 1990: 26). In this model, the dominance of the market is encouraged both \npassively, by guaranteeing only a minimum, and actively, by subsidizing private \nwelfare schemes (Esping-Andersen, 1990: 27). The liberal welfare state regime \nthereby minimizes the decommodification effects of state welfare and a stark division \nexists between those, largely the poor, who rely on state aid and those who are able to \nafford private provision  \n \nThe conservative welfare state regime (Germany, France, Austria, Benelux countries \nand Italy) is distinguished by its \u2018status differentiating\u2019 welfare programs in which \nbenefits are often earnings related, administered through the employer; and geared \ntowards maintaining existing social patterns. The role of the family is also \nemphasized and the redistributive impact is minimal. However, the role of the market \nis marginalized, and therefore Esping-Andersen places it between the low \ndecommodifying liberal regime and the highly decommodifying social democratic \nregime (1990: 27). \n \nThe \u2018third world of welfare\u2019, the social democratic (Nordic countries), is the clearly \nthe smallest regime cluster. Its provision is characterized by universal and \ncomparatively generous benefits, a commitment to full employment and income \nprotection; and a strongly interventionist state. The state is used to promote social \nequality through a redistributive social security system. Unlike the other welfare state \nregimes, the social democratic regime type \u2018promotes an equality of the highest \n 6 \nstandards, not an equality of minimal needs\u2019 (Esping-Andersen, 1990) and it provides \n\u2018a mix of highly decommodifying and universalistic programs\u2019 (1990: 28).    \n \nThe \u2018worlds of welfare\u2019 debate \nThis \u2018three worlds\u2019 typology has sparked a volatile and ongoing debate (Sainsbury, \n1999a; 1999b; Goodin, 1999; Pitruzzello, 1999; Arts and Gelissen, 2002; Kasza, \n2002; Bambra, 2004) and, indeed, much of the burgeoning comparative welfare state \nliterature since 1990 can be seen as a \u2018settling of accounts\u2019 with Esping-Andersen \n(Pierson, 1999: 175). Four substantive critiques of his typology have emerged: the \nrange (Leibfreid, 1992; Castles & Mitchell, 1993; Ferrera, 1996; Bonoli, 1997); the \nmethodology (Kangas, 1994; Ragin, 1994; Shalev, 1996; Pitruzzello, 1999); the \nusefulness of the regime concept (Kasza, 2002); and the omission of gender in the \nanalysis (Lewis, 1992; Orloff, 1993; Borchost, 1994; Daly, 1994, Sainsbury, 1999). \n \nThe limited range \nThe range of countries used to construct Esping-Andersen\u2019s typology has met with \ncriticism (Leibfried, 1992; Catles & Mitchell, 1993; Ferrera, 1996; Bonoli, 1997). \nLeibfreid (1992), Ferrera (1996) and Bonoli (1997) assert that a distinctive fourth type \nof welfare state regime is emerging in the countries of the Latin rim of the European \nUnion (Spain, Portugal, Greece and to a lesser extent Italy). Leibfreid (1992) \ndescribes these welfare states as \u2018rudimentary\u2019 because they are characterised by their \nfragmented system of welfare provision which consists of diverse income \nmaintenance schemes that range from the meagre to the generous and a health care \nsystem that provides only limited and partial coverage.  \n \n 7 \nCastles and Mitchell (1993) similarly challenge the notion that there are only three \nworlds of welfare. They cross-classify the same 18 OECD nations used by Esping-\nAndersen and examine their high and low aggregate expenditure levels, and their high \nand low degrees of benefit equality. On the basis of this analysis, they claim that a \nfourth, \u2018radical\u2019, world of welfare should be added to the thesis (Castles & Mitchell, \n1993: 107). They argue that the UK, Australia and New Zealand constitute a \u2018radical\u2019 \nform of welfare state regime, one in which \u2018the welfare goals of poverty amelioration \nand income equality are pursued through redistributive instruments rather than by \nhigh expenditure levels\u2019 (Castles & Mitchell, 1993: 107).  \n \nThe methodological approach \nA more general methodological critique of Esping-Andersen has been developed \nthrough the use of cluster analysis. Kangas (1994) performed a cluster analysis of \nindicators of sickness insurance for the same 18 OECD countries. The results broadly \nconfirmed Esping-Andersen\u2019s \u2018three worlds\u2019 thesis although the existence of a \ncoherent liberal regime was questionned: no clear liberal regime cluster was identified \nas whilst the UK, Ireland, New Zealand and Australia were merged together, the USA \nand Canada were separate outliers. However, a more comprehensive cluster analysis \n(Pitruzzello, 1999) of all three of Esping-Andersen\u2019s decommodification factors \n(sickness, pensions and unemployment) revealed a number of significant \ndiscrepancies. Pitruzzello\u2019s research showed significant support for the existence and \ndistinctiveness of welfare regimes, but it challenged the empirical accuracy of the \n\u2018three worlds\u2019 typology: Australia, New Zealand, the UK and Ireland were identified \nas a distinctive fourth cluster and the Southern European countries were seen as a sub-\n 8 \ngroup of the corporatist cluster. This suggested that there could be four or five \u2018worlds \nof welfare\u2019 (Pitruzello, 1999: 23-50). \n \nThe \u2018illusion\u2019 of welfare state regimes \nKasza (2002) has questioned the validity of the regimes concept itself. He argues that \nthe concept of welfare regimes incorporates two flawed assumptions: firstly, that most \nof the key social policy areas, such as income maintenance, education, health or \nhousing, within a welfare regime will reflect a similar, across the board, approach to \nwelfare provision; and secondly, that each regime type itself reflects \u2018a set of \nprinciples or values that establishes a coherence in each country\u2019s welfare package\u2019 \n(Kasza, 2002: 272). Kasza asserts that instead of an internal policy homogeneity or \ncohesion, welfare states and welfare regimes exhibit significant variation across \ndifferent areas of social provision. He asserts that the regime concept therefore \u2018does \nnot capture the complex motives that inform each country\u2019s welfare programs\u2019 and, in \npursuit of consistency, it ignores the fact that different areas of welfare state provision \nexhibit different cross-national variations. \n \nThe gender blind \u2018worlds of welfare\u2019 \nThis is perhaps the most developed and influential critique of the \u2018three worlds of \nwelfare\u2019 (Esping-Andersen, 1999). Feminist commentators, such as Langan & Ostner, \n1991; Lewis, 1992; Borchost, 1994; Bussemaker and Kersbergen, 1994; Daly, 1994; \nHobson, 1994; Lewis and Ostner, 1995; Sainsbury, 1994, 1999, have argued that \nEsping-Andersen\u2019s \u2018three worlds of welfare\u2019 typology is deeply flawed because it \nmarginalized women in its analysis. Aside from the overt absence of women in \nEsping-Andersen\u2019s analysis, the critique revolves around three other issues: the \n 9 \ngender blind concept of decommodification (Daly, 1994; Hobson, 1994; Lewis, \n1992), the unawareness of the role of women and the family in the provision of \nwelfare (Borchost, 1994; Bussemaker and Kersbergen, 1994; Daly, 1994), and the \nlack of consideration given to gender as a form of social stratification (Bussemaker \nand Kersbergen, 1994). These criticisms have in turn led to both theoretical attempts \nto \u2018gender\u2019 Esping-Andersen\u2019s analysis (for example, Orloff, 1993; O\u2019Connor, 1993), \nand the construction of alternative welfare state typologies in which gender has been a \nmore overt and centralised part of the analysis (for example Lewis, 1992; Lewis and \nOstner, 1995; Sainsbury, 1999). These alternative typologies, although often flawed \nthemselves (Esping-Andersen, 1999), have undermined the comprehensiveness and \ngeneralizability of the \u2018three worlds of welfare\u2019 thesis - especially in respect to any \nclaims about women, welfare and the family.  \n \nThis paper does not dispute that some of these criticisms are valid, however, the \noverwhelmingly negative nature of the debate that has surrounded the \u2018three worlds\u2019 \ntypology has obscured the most important aspect of the typology: its robustness and \nvalidity overtime. This will now be explored through the reconstruction of Esping-\nAndersen\u2019s decommodification index. \n \nDecommodification \nIn this paper, the reconstruction of Esping-Andersen\u2019s typology is limited to the \nrecreation and updating of the decommodification index as this is the more substantial \ninfluence on the final composition of the typology (Esping-Andersen, 1990: 26-29, \n52) and furthermore, it is the easier to reconstruct in terms of data availability and \ncomparability.  \n 10 \n \nThe concept of decommodification essentially relates to \u2018the extent to which \nindividuals and families can maintain a normal and socially acceptable standard of \nliving regardless of their market performance\u2019 (Esping-Andersen, 1987: 86). \nCommodification on the other hand refers to the extent to which workers and their \nfamilies are reliant upon the market sale of their labor. Labor became extensively \ncommodified during the industrial revolution as workers became entirely dependent \nupon the market for their survival (Esping-Andersen, 1990: 21). In the 20\nth\n century, \nthe introduction of social rights that entailed entitlement to social welfare brought \nabout a \u2018loosening\u2019 of the pure commodity status of labor. The welfare state \ndecommodified labor because certain services and a certain standard of living became \na right of citizenship and reliance on the market for survival decreased (1990: 22). \nHowever, it must be noted that under capitalism, whilst the pure commodification of \nlabor is possible, its pure decommodification is not (O\u2019Connor, 1993: 61). The issue \nfor the index is therefore the relative degrees of protection from dependence on the \nlabor market provided by different welfare states. \n \nThe decommodification index attempts to operationalize this concept of relative \ndecommodification and thereby measure the extent of decommodification in each \nwelfare state. It is based upon the scores given to each country for their relative \nrelationship with a number of factors which are selected for their perceived usefulness \nin determining the relationship between an individual\u2019s welfare and the market. \nEsping-Andersen constructs three separate decommodification indexes; one for \npensions, one for unemployment benefits and another for sickness benefits, he then \ncombines the scores for these to provide one overall decommodification index.  \n 11 \n \nDecommodification index \nThe updated labor market decommodification index is constructed in the same way as \nEsping-Andersen\u2019s labor market indexes even though this methodology has certain \ndrawbacks, such as the use of averaging, and has met with some criticism within the \nliterature (Castles and Mitchell, 1993; Kangas, 1994; Ragin, 1994; Shalev, 1996; \nPitruzello, 1999). The index has to replicate Esping-Andersen\u2019s method to ensure \ncompatibility and to be a valid test of robustness and divergence or convergence. \n \nCountries \nThe decommodification index includes the same 18 OECD countries used by Esping-\nAndersen in the 1980s: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, \nFrance, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, \nSwitzerland, UK, and USA.  \n \nData and Sources \nThe data used to compile the updated index relates to the years 1998 and 1999. Some \ndifficulties were encountered in locating and accessing the necessary data to construct \nthe updated decommodification index. For example, there was no database that \ndirectly quantifies the coverage rate of pensions, unemployment benefit and sickness \nbenefit for all of the 18 countries. However, a number of steps were taken to ensure \ncomparability between the new decommodification index and Esping-Andersen\u2019s \noriginal. Firstly, whilst the OECD now contains 29 countries, only the 18 countries \nused by Esping-Andersen in his original calculations have been included in the index. \nSecondly, where possible, the same data sources used by Esping-Andersen have been \n 12 \ndrawn upon. Thirdly, the same factors have been used for each of the updated \nindexes. Finally, the majority of data that has been used is of an international nature \n(such as that published by Eurostat, the UN or the OECD). The international nature of \nthis data has helped to minimize any cross-national differences over the measurement, \ndefinition and collection of data. These measures should ensure data comparability \nboth between countries and between Esping-Andersen\u2019s original index and the one in \nthis paper. \n \nMeasures \nThe decommodification index is based on the assessment of a number of factors \nrelating to the three main income maintenance programmes: pensions, unemployment, \nand sickness. \n \nTABLE 1 HERE \n \nMethod \nThe process of scoring for each of the three constituent schemes in the \ndecommodification index (pensions, unemployment and sickness) replicates that used \nby Esping-Andersen (1990: 50-54) and is by way of the numerical description of the \nrelationship of an individual country\u2019s score to the mean (and standard deviation) for \nfour (1-4) of the five factors that make up each index. On the basis of the values on \neach of these four indicators for the 18 nations, a score of 1 for low \ndecommodification; 2 for medium; and 3 for high decommodification was given.  \n \nFIGURE 1 HERE \n 13 \n \nFollowing Esping-Andersen, the classification into three scores has been done on the \nbasis of one standard deviation from the mean with adjustment where necessary for \nextreme outliers (1990:54). This score has been weighted by factor 5 - the percent of \nthe (relevant) population covered by the program. In line with Esping-Andersen\u2019s \napproach and his concern for the importance of replacement rates, these variables \nhave been given extra weight (multiplied by the factor of 2) in each index. Finally, the \nresults of these three separate indexes, pension, unemployment and sickness, have \nbeen combined to give the overall decommodification score for each country (see \nAppendix). \n \nTherefore, for example, for the pensions decommodification index, a score of 1(low \ndecommodification), 2 (medium decommodification) or 3 (high decommodification) \nis given to each country based upon how their score relates to the mean for each of the \nfirst four factors: (1) Minimum pension benefits for a standard production worker \nexpressed as a replacement rate (double weight), (2) Standard pension benefits for a \nstandard production worker, (3) Contribution period required to qualify for a pension \n(scored inversely); and (4) Individual\u2019s share of pension financing (Esping-Andersen, \n1990: 54). The score for each of these factors is then combined and weighted by the \nfifth factor, in the case of pensions, the coverage rate. This figure is the overall \ndecommodification score for that country for pensions. This process is repeated for \nthe unemployment and sickness decommodification indexes in order to provide the \nfinal decommodification score for each country. \n \nResults \n 14 \nThe assessment and combination of these factors (see appendix for details of \nindividual factor data) produces an indicative decommodification index:  \n \nTABLE 2 HERE \n \nThis index shows a wide range of decommodification scores, from New Zealand\u2019s \nscore of 11.5 to the highest score of 34.7 awarded to Sweden. The majority of \ncountries fall in between 22 (Ireland) and 32 (Belgium). None of the scores are \nsurprisingly high or surprisingly low and those allotted to each country, and the range \nof scores, are very similar to those under Esping-Andersen\u2019s index (Esping-Andersen, \n1990: 54). This suggests that there has been no great change in the relative \ndecommodification rates of the index countries. In order to make a more informed \ncomparison between the results of this decommodification index and Esping-\nAndersen\u2019s typology the, mean plus\/minus SD, method used to construct the index \ncan be continued in order to place the countries into one of three groups. This process \nproduces a comparable typology through which the relative relationships of countries \ncan be explored: \n \nTABLE 3 HERE \n \nThere are striking similarities between Esping-Andersen\u2019s regimes and the \ndecommodification groups based on current data. The majority of countries are placed \nin similar groupings as in Esping-Andersen\u2019s index. For example, Australia, Ireland, \nNew Zealand, the UK, and the USA are in the lowest decommodification group; \nAustria, Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland are still in the \n 15 \nmedium level of decommodification group; and Norway and Sweden are still the \nhighest scoring countries. There are some slight differences in group composition as \nCanada is now found in the medium decommodification Group 2 whereas previously \nit had been in the low decommodification Liberal regime. Another change at this end \nof the index is Japan\u2019s move from the Conservative regime (medium \ndecommodification) to Group 1 (low decommodification). Group 3 (high \ndecommodification) also shows a change as Denmark has moved into Group 2 \n(medium decommodification). However, overall the differences between the two \ntypologies are very slight - only 3 countries have changed position - and the emphasis \nis therefore on continuity rather than change in respect of the relative scores and \nrelationships of the 18 countries. \n \nDiscussion \nEarlier in the paper two competing hypotheses were outlined, one that emphasized the \nconvergence of welfare states (hypothesis 1) and the other that focused on resilience \nand continued divergence (hypothesis 2). It is useful to briefly return to these \nhypotheses in the context of the comparison of the two typologies. Hypothesis 1, that \nwelfare states have converged and that Esping-Andersen\u2019s \u2018worlds of welfare\u2019 have \nbegun to disintegrate is given very little support as there have been few changes in the \nrelative relationships of the different countries in terms of what their welfare state \nprovision actually does, in other words, the relative levels of decommodification \noffered by different types of welfare state have not changed. The typologies show an \noverarching similarity and this suggests, in line with hypothesis 2, that Esping-\nAndersen\u2019s \u2018worlds of welfare\u2019 typology is robust and that welfare sates have \nmaintained their diversity over time. \n 16 \n \nThe continued diversity of welfare states and the lack of change between the two \ntypologies suggests that the negative debate that has surrounded Esping-Andersen\u2019s \ntypology has somewhat missed the main point: whilst Esping-Andersen\u2019s typology \nhad a limited number of countries (Leibfreid, 1992; Castles & Mitchell, 1993; Ferrera, \n1996), did not consider gender (Lewis, 1992; Orloff, 1993; Borchost, 1994; Daly, \n1994; Sainsbury, 1999), and used a particular methodology (Kangas, 1994; Ragin, \n1994; Shalev, 1996; Pitruzzello, 1999); it is still a valid, if generalized, way of \ndividing welfare states based on their main function - decommodification. The \ntypology has passed a formidable test of robustness and in maintaining its validity \nover the past twenty years it can be suggested that whilst it has some flaws, the \n\u2018worlds of welfare\u2019 typology can still offer valuable insights into the nature of welfare \nstates, their relative relationships with one another and the extent to which they \nremain diverse over time and in their responses to change.  \n \nThis lack of change across the two typologies also serves to undermine another aspect \nof hypothesis 1 - the theories of welfare state convergence propagated by adherents of \nthe globalization school (Callinicos, 1994; Boyer and Drache, 1996; Milner and \nKeohane, 1996; Mishra, 1996; 1999; Strange, 1996; Rhodes, 1997; Greider, 1997; \nMartin and Schumann, 1997; Rodrik, 1997; Gray, 1998). Although the comparison of \nthe two typologies can only provide a limited insight into the nature and extent of \nwelfare state change, its suggestion that the relative relationships have remained fairly \nstatic and that there are still distinctive welfare state formations is supported by the \nresults of other cross-national comparisons (Navarro, 1999; 2000; Alber and Standing, \n2000; Esping-Andersen, 2000; Ferrera and Rhodes, 2000; Kuhnle, 2000; Scharpf and \n 17 \nSchmidt, 2000; Castles, 2001; Leibfreid, 2001; Huber and Stephens, 2001; Taylor-\nGooby, 2001; 2002). These studies have similarly concluded that welfare states have \nmaintained their diversity in the face of the common pressures of the last twenty years \nand that whilst there have been some signs of reform and retrenchment, this has been \ndone in a path dependent manner (Pierson, 1994; 1996; 1998; 2001). Welfare state \ninstitutions have evolved in distinctive ways and the patterns of retrenchment have \nbeen different in each country and type of welfare state. There has not been a wide \nscale retrenchment in line with the liberal model of welfare provision (Kuhnle, 2000; \nLeibfreid, 2000). Far from converging around one approach as suggested by the \nconvergence position, different types of welfare state have maintained and adapted \ntheir unique approaches by responding differently to common problems (Ferrera and \nRhodes, 2000; Esping-Andersen, 2000; Pierson, 2001), they have kept their solutions \nto the difficulties posed by high unemployment, low economic growth and the ageing \npopulation in line with their original welfare state ethos: the social democratic welfare \nstates have responded by increasing their active labor market policies whilst \nmaintaining their universal system; the conservative countries have encouraged early \nexit from the labor market and increased the role of the family in the provision of \nwelfare; and the liberal countries have tended to enhance the role of the market and \nfurther targeted key benefits (Esping-Andersen, 2000). These responses may falter in \nthe future and take on more common themes but at present, the \u2018worlds of welfare\u2019 \nare maintaining their integrity.  \n \nConclusion \nThe results of the new decommodification index and typology show that there has \nbeen little change in the relative positioning of different welfare states, that there are \n 18 \nstill three distinctive \u2018worlds of welfare\u2019, and that despite the negativity encountered \nin the literature, Esping-Andersen\u2019s approach is still of great utility in the quest to \nclassify welfare states. Despite the passing of time and the pressures and changes \nexperienced by welfare states, there is little change in their relative relationships and \nno sign yet of the convergence at the bottom prophesised by the globalization school: \nthe typology is robust - the diverse \u2018worlds of welfare\u2019 have weathered the storm. \n \nAppendix \nTABLE 4 HERE \nTABLE 5 HERE \nTABLE 6 HERE \n 19 \nReferences \nAbrahamson, P.
