THE EXPERIENCE OF THE\nERITREA\u2013ETHIOPIA BOUNDARY COMMISSION\nMALCOLM N SHAW QC*\nAbstract This article examines the establishment and work of the\nEritrea\u2013Ethiopia Boundary Commission with regard to its decision of 13\nApril 2002 concerning the delimitation of the border between Eritrea and\nEthiopia and subsequent events. Apart from an examination of the substan-\ntive decision of the Commission in the light of the law relating to territory,\nthe article will discuss certain unusual features of the process, including\nmandating the Commission both to delimit and demarcate the boundary and\nthe involvement of third parties. The delimitation decision is significant in a\nnumber of ways, including its views as to the applicable law, treaty interpre-\ntation and the subsequent conduct of the parties in relation to title. The long-\nrunning and difficult process of demarcation is noted, together with the\nimportant role played by the UN and other international actors.\nThe experience of the Eritrea\u2013Ethiopia Boundary Commission is proving\ninstructive both with regards to the illumination of the relevant principles\nconcerning delimitation and demarcation and with regard to the methodology\nof the peaceful settlement of boundary disputes. Its establishment marked an\nattempt to resolve a violent territorial conflict and its continued existence has\nunderscored the continuing tensions between the parties. The fundamental\nquestions raised may be divided into substantive legal problems, covering, for\nexample, treaty interpretation and the treatment of subsequent conduct by the\nparties, which may be seen in the context of other important judgments on\nterritorial disputes in recent decades,1 and broader strategic matters concern-\ning the combined mandate of delimitation and demarcation determination and\nthe interleaving of legal and political processes with the involvement of the\nUnited Nations.\n* The Sir Robert Jennings Professor of International Law, University of Leicester.\n1 See, eg, the Eritrea\u2013Yemen Arbitration Awards of 1998 (Territorial Sovereignty and Scope\nof the Dispute) and 1999 (Maritime Delimitation) (2005) Permanent Court of Arbitration Award\nSeries; Frontier Dispute (Benin\/Niger) [2005] ICJ Rep 90; Sovereignty over Pulau Sipadan\n(Indonesia\/Malaysia) [2002] ICJ Rep 625; Land and Maritime Boundary between Cameroon and\nNigeria (Cameroon v Nigeria) [2002] ICJ Rep 303; Maritime Delimitation and Territorial\nQuestions between Qatar and Bahrain (Qatar v Bahrain) [2001] ICJ Rep 40; Territorial Dispute\n(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya\/Chad) [1994] ICJ Rep 6; Land, Island and Maritime Frontier Dispute\n(El Salvador\/Honduras) [1992] ICJ Rep 351; Frontier Dispute (Burkina Faso\/ Mali) [1986] ICJ\nRep 554.\n[ICLQ vol 56, October 2007 pp 755\u2013796] doi: 10.1093\/iclq\/lei201\n \nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Aug 2013 IP address: 143.210.121.140\nI. THE BASIC FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND THE ESTABLISHMENT\nOF THE COMMISSION\nEthiopia has long been a member of the international community as an inde-\npendent State, save for a period following its conquest and annexation by Italy\nin 1935. Large parts of Eritrea had been subject to Ottoman and Egyptian\nauthority prior to the 1880s, to be succeeded by increasing Italian attempts to\nestablish control. In 1889, the Treaty of Uccialli provided for a boundary\nbetween Ethiopia and the Italian possessions in Eritrea. The Italian colony of\nEritrea was formally proclaimed on 1 January 1890. In 1900, 1902 and 1908,\nEthiopia and Italy signed treaties which established the entire boundary\nbetween the Colony of Eritrea and the Empire of Ethiopia. None of the bound-\naries thus agreed was demarcated and, as the Commission was to conclude,\n\u2018each of these boundaries was, to varying degrees, not fully delimited\u2019.2\nIn 1935, Italy invaded and annexed Ethiopia. The Italians were expelled by\nBritish forces in 1941 from both Ethiopia and Eritrea. The Emperor of\nEthiopia regained control of his country the following year, while Eritrea\nremained under British control until 1952. Following failure to agree on the\ndisposition of Eritrea, the issue was passed to the United Nations, which in\nGeneral Assembly Resolution 390A (V), 1950, declared that Eritrea would\nconstitute an autonomous unit federated with Ethiopia under the sovereignty\nof the Ethiopian Crown. The treaties of 1900, 1902 and 1908 were declared\nnull and void by Ethiopia on 11 September 1952 and the federal status of\nEritrea was abolished two months later. Following continual upheavals and\nchanges of government in Ethiopia, Eritrea became independent on 27 April\n1993. In May 1998, hostilities broke out between Eritrea and Ethiopia.\nFollowing the Framework Agreement and the Modalities for its\nImplementation of July 1999 and the Agreement on Cessation of Hostilities of\nJune 2000, both of which were endorsed by the Organization of African Unity\n(OAU) (now the African Union (AU)) and the United Nations, the Agreement\nof 12 December 2000 (the December Agreement) was signed in Algiers by the\ntwo States, providing for the permanent termination of hostilities.3\nThe December Agreement provided for the creation of a \u2018neutral Boundary\nCommission\u2019 in The Hague.4 This Commission was, and remains, composed\n756 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n2 Eritrea\u2013Ethiopia Boundary Commission Award, para 2.7.\n3 ibid paras 2.8\u20132.13. See also the reports of the International Crisis Group dated 24\nSeptember 2003 and 22 December 2005; and B Simma and D Khan, \u2018Peaceful Settlement of\nBoundary Disputes under the Auspices of the Organization of African Unity and the United\nNations: The Case of the Frontier Dispute Between Eritrea and Ethiopia\u2019 in N Ando et al (eds),\nLiber Amicorum Judge Shigeru Oda (Kluwer, The Hague, 2002) 1179.\n4 To consist of five members, two of whom were to be appointed by each party by way of\nwritten notice to the UN Secretary-General within 45 days of the date of the Agreement and none\nof whom were to be nationals or permanent residents of the party making the appointment. The\npresident of the Commission was to be selected by the party-appointed commissioners, see Art 4\n(2), (3), (4), and (5). Within the time-limits provided for in the Agreement, Eritrea appointed as\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Aug 2013 IP address: 143.210.121.140\nof a former President of the International Court of Justice, a former Judge of\nthe International Court, a former ad hoc Judge of the International Court, a\nformer President of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and a\nformer Legal Adviser to the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\nConsiderable judicial, arbitral and scholarly experience is thus reflected in the\ncomposition of the Commission.5\nThere are several critical points that distinguish the Commission from other\nboundary court or tribunal processes. First, the Commission was asked both to\ndelimit and demarcate the boundary in question. This had the apparent advan-\ntage that the demarcation process could proceed on the basis of considerable\nknowledge gained in the delimitation phase, which should have speeded up the\nprocess. Secondly, and unusually for an arbitration, the process was institu-\ntionally underpinned by benefiting from the overt support of the United\nNations and the OAU\/AU. This is reflected in the preamble to the December\nAgreement and in the fact that this agreement was \u2018witnessed\u2019 by Algeria, the\nUN, the OAU\/AU, the European Union and the US.6 Thirdly, the degree of\npost-delimitation award practice that has taken place has enabled a number of\nclarifications to be made and has embedded the Commission in the process of\nimplementation. This is unusual in that usually the court or tribunal producing\na boundary decision ceases its involvement once the decision has been made.\nThe advantage is that in an implementation process of some complexity and\ncontroversy, the parties are able to obtain authoritative guidance. The disad-\nvantage is that it may place the awarding body in a rather vulnerable position\nbetween the contending parties.\nFourthly, the December Agreement imposed stringent time constraints\nupon the process. In particular, the Commission was to commence its work not\nmore than 15 days after its constitution and was to \u2018endeavour to make its\ndecision concerning delimitation of the border within six months of its first\nmeeting\u2019.7 Although the Commission was given the power to extend this dead-\nline, the tight schedule may well have had an impact upon the ability of the\nparties to produce the necessary materials and to formulate the arguments\nrequired in such a complex case, particularly so soon after a violent and\ndisruptive conflict.\nThe Experience of the Eritrea\u2013Ethiopia Boundary Commission 757\nCommissioners Mr Jan Paulsson and Judge Stephen Schwebel and Ethiopia appointed HE Prince\nBola Adesumbo Ajibola and Sir Arthur Watts. Professor Sir Elihu Lauterpacht was selected as\nPresident of the Commission. The appointment of Mr Jan Paulsson was challenged by Ethiopia.\nAn Interim Rule of Procedure was adopted on 5 April 2001 allowing for challenges to a member\nof the Commission to be decided by the remaining Commissioners and if this was not possible,\nby the UN Secretary-General. In the event the matter was remitted to the UN Secretary-General\nbut before this was decided, Mr Paulsson resigned, it being understood that the resignation did not\nimply an acceptance of the validity of the alleged grounds of challenge. In accordance with Art 4\n(6) of the December Agreement, Eritrea appointed Professor W Michael Reisman to fill the\nvacancy. Eritrea\u2013Ethiopia Boundary Commission Award, paras 1.3\u20131.14.\n5 The UN Cartographer (Dr Hiroshi Murakami) was appointed to serve as Secretary to the\nCommission.\n6 See below, p 792. 7 Art 4(12).\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Aug 2013 IP address: 143.210.121.140\nThe parties agreed from the start that \u2018the delimitation and demarcation\ndeterminations of the Commission shall be final and binding\u2019 and that \u2018[e]ach\nparty shall respect the border so determined, as well as the territorial integrity\nand sovereignty of the other party\u2019.8 The final decision on delimitation was to\nbe transmitted to the parties and to the Secretaries General of the OAU and the\nUN for publication and the UN was asked to \u2018facilitate resolutions of problems\nwhich may arise due to the transfer of territorial control, including the conse-\nquences for individuals residing in previously disputed territory\u2019.9\nThe Commission met in The Hague on 25 March 2001 and on the follow-\ning day conducted a meeting with the representative of the parties, at which a\nRegistrar was appointed and the schedule of work tentatively agreed.10 On 20\nJune 2001 Rules of Procedure were adopted by the Commission, based, as\nrequired by Article 4(11) of the Agreement, on the 1992 Permanent Court of\nArbitration Optional Rules for Arbitrating Disputes between Two States. The\nunanimous delimitation decision was rendered on 13 April 2002.\nII. SUBSTANTIVE LEGAL ISSUES\nA. The Applicable Law\nArticle 4(1) of the December Agreement provided that:\nthe parties reaffirm the principle of respect for the borders existing at indepen-\ndence as stated in resolution AHG\/Res.16 (1) of the OAU Summit in Cairo in\n1964, and in this regard, they shall be determined on the basis of pertinent colo-\nnial treaties and applicable international law.\nArticle 4(2) provided that a neutral Boundary Commission be established\n\u2018with a mandate to delimit and demarcate the colonial treaty border based on\npertinent colonial treaties (1900, 1902 and 1908) and applicable international\nlaw\u2019. The Commission was \u2018not to have the power to make decisions ex aequo\net bono\u2019.\nThis applicable law requirement mirrored that laid down, for example, for\nthe International Court in the Botswana\/Namibia case,11 where Article 1 of the\nSpecial Agreement between the parties provided that that Court was asked \u2018to\ndetermine, on the basis of the Anglo-German Treaty of 1 July 1890 and the\nrules and principles of international law, the boundary between Namibia and\n758 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n8 Art 4(15).\n9 Art 4(13) and (16).\n10 According to which the parties would simultaneously file written Memorials on 30 June\n2001 and Counter-Memorials on 22 September 2001.

The Court concluded that such reference authorized it to apply the rules\nand principles of international law independently of the treaty, including in the\ncircumstances of the case, arguments as to prescription advanced by\nNamibia.13\nThe Commission expressly relied upon the views of the Court in\nBotswana\/Namibia, noting that the Court accepted the possibility that \u2018an\nattribution of territory following from its interpretation of the relevant bound-\nary treaty could be varied by operation of the customary international law\nrules relating to prescription\u2019.14 The Commission concluded, therefore, that\nthe reference in the December Agreement to applicable international law\ncould not be limited to the law relating to the interpretation of treaties.\nAccordingly, the Ethiopian contention that the boundary should be delimited\nexclusively on the basis of the three colonial treaties as interpreted in accor-\ndance with the rules of international law governing treaty interpretation could\nnot be accepted. The Commission considered that: \u2018it is required also to apply\nthose rules of international law applicable generally to the determination of\ndisputed borders including, in particular, the rules relating to the effect of\nconduct of the parties\u2019.15\nThis is surely correct. Any other interpretation would have left redundant\nthe additional phrase agreed by the parties in the applicable law provision in\nArticle 4(1) of the Agreement (\u2018and applicable international law\u2019), something\nclearly contrary to the intention of the parties. Like the International Court, the\nCommission concluded that the terms of the applicable law requirement meant\nthat the relevant treaties had to be examined first, and only then would\nrecourse be made to the rules of general international law in order to see if the\nprovisions of the treaties needed to be modified. This is an implicit recogni-\ntion of the fact that the terms of a boundary treaty alone could not always be\ndeterminative of a territorial delimitation, thus permitting recourse to extra-\ntitular practice where necessary, but only where necessary.\nArticle 4(1) of the December Agreement also made reference to \u2018the prin-\nciple of respect for the borders existing at independence as stated in\nResolution AHG\/Res.16 (1) of the OAU Summit in Cairo in 1964\u2019.

Treaty Interpretation\nThe role of treaties in the establishment of boundaries is paramount. Boundary\ntreaties, where they exist, comprise a root of title in themselves and constitute\na special kind of treaty in that they establish an objective territorial regime\nvalid erga omnes.28 Such a regime will not only create rights binding also\nupon third States, but will exist outside of the particular boundary treaty and\nthus will continue even if the treaty in question itself ceases to apply.29 The\nreason for this exceptional approach is to be found in the need for the stability\nof boundaries.30 Accordingly, where there is a relevant boundary agreement,\nthis will constitute not only the relevant starting point but also the presump-\ntive source and determination of the line in any dispute. It is for this reason\nthat boundary disputes focus to a large extent upon the meaning of the provi-\nsions of any pertinent agreement or agreements.\nSince the parties requested the Commission to delimit the boundary\nbetween them on the basis of the \u2018pertinent colonial treaties (1900, 1902, and\n1908) and applicable international law\u2019, and since the parties agreed that the\nthree treaties in question covered the whole of the boundary between them, the\nmeaning of those treaties naturally became \u2018a central feature\u2019 of the dispute.31\nThe Commission proceeded, therefore, to its initial and primary task on the\nbasis that \u2018it will apply the general rule that a treaty is to be interpreted in good\nfaith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the\ntreaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\u2019.32 This details\nthe essential elements contained in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the\nLaw of Treaties 1969, which has been held by the International Court in a\nnumber of cases to constitute a reflection of customary international law.33\nThe Commission, however, rather than simply reiterating this, went further in\nemphasizing that these elements were a means of guiding the interpreter in\nestablishing what the parties actually intended, or their \u2018common will\u2019.34 To\nput it another way, the text of the treaties read in the light of their object and\npurpose, context and negotiating history, and the subsequent course of conduct\nof the parties were to be seen as \u2018tools for determining \u201cthe common will\u201d of\nthe parties\u2019.35\nThe Experience of the Eritrea\u2013Ethiopia Boundary Commission 761\n28 See Eritrea\/Yemen (n 1) para 153. 29 See Libya\/Chad (n 1) 6, 37.\n30 ibid and Case concerning the Temple of Preah Vihear (Cambodia v Thailand) [1962] ICJ\nRep 6, 34.\n31 Eritrea\u2013Ethiopia Boundary Commission Award, para 3.3. 32 ibid para 3.4.\n33 See, eg, the Libya\/Chad case (n 1) 21\u201322; Botswana\/Namibia case (n 11) 1059; and\nIndonesia\/Malaysia (n 1) para 37.\n34 Eritrea\u2013Ethiopia Boundary Commission Award, para 3.4, quoting the 1966 Argentina\/Chile\nFrontier case (n 24) 10, 89.\n35 ibid para 5.16.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Aug 2013 IP address: 143.210.121.140\n1. The doctrine of contemporaneity\nThe Commission accepted that in interpreting the treaties in question, it should\napply the doctrine of \u2018contemporaneity\u2019. This was understood to mean that \u2018a\ntreaty should be interpreted by reference to the circumstances prevailing when\nthe treaty was concluded\u2019. Further, it was noted that this involved giving\nexpressions used in the treaties (including names), the meaning that they\nwould have possessed at that time.36 The Commission stated the general prin-\nciples as follows: \u2018The determination of the meaning and effect of a geograph-\nical name used in a treaty, whether of a place or of a river, depends upon the\ncontemporary understanding of the location to which that name related at the\ntime of the treaty.\u201937 This approach was indeed reflected later in 2002 by the\nInternational Court in Cameroon v Nigeria, where it was emphasized that in\nseeking to determine the location of the mouth of the River Ebeji under the\nterms of the relevant international agreement, \u2018the Court must seek to ascer-\ntain the intention of the parties at the time\u2019.38\nThe problem arose particularly in relation to rivers in the Eritrea\u2013Ethiopia\nsituation. In this regard the Commission emphasized that:\nWhat matters most is the identification of what the parties intended in referring\nto a watercourse as a feature in the landscape, rather than its name. If the name\nused is incorrect, then it is the parties\u2019 intentions with respect to the reality on the\nground rather than the name which is decisive.39\nIn seeking to elucidate the intentions of the parties, the Commission declared\nthat \u2018the principal evidence is what they said in the treaty\u2019.40\nHowever, the Commission made reference to the role of modern knowl-\nedge in the process of determining the intention of the parties. It noted that the\nmap annexed to the 1900 treaty concerning the Central Sector \u2018may be\nfollowed so long as it is not shown to be so at variance with modern knowl-\nedge as to render it valueless as an indicator of what the parties could have\nintended on the ground\u2019.41\n2. Treaty interpretation issues arising from the 1902 treaty (the Western\nSector)\nThe 1902 treaty dealt with the Western Sector of the boundary from the\ntripoint with Sudan and thence eastwards.

Nor was there a dispute with\nregard to the end of this sector of the boundary, ending at the confluence of the\nMareb and Mai Ambessa (Point 9). However, there was a considerable differ-\nence between the parties concerning the intervening area (including the plain\nand village of Badme, the site of fighting between the parties as from May\n1998,42 and later to figure in post-decision implementation problems).\nEthiopia claimed essentially a straight line going north-east, linking Points 3\nand 9; Eritrea claimed a line in the form of a \u2018v\u2019 shape that dipped south-east\nfollowing the river Setit43 and then moved north-east in a straight line to Point\n9.44\nArticle 1 of the treaty provided that, from Point 3, the boundary was to\nfollow the course of the river Maiteb \u2018so as to leave Mount Ala Tacura to\nEritrea, and joins the Mareb at its junction with the Mai Ambessa\u2019 (Point 9).\nIt was also provided that \u2018the line from the junction of the Setit and Maieteb\nto the junction of the Mareb and Mai Ambessa shall be delimited by Italian\nand Ethiopian delegates, so that the Canama tribe belong to Eritrea\u2019. No such\ndelimitation occurred.45\nThe dispute therefore focused upon two elements: first, the identity and\ncourse of the river \u2018Maiteb\u2019 with regard to which contemporary maps differed;\nand secondly, the question of the location of the Canama tribe. In seeking to\ninterpret the treaty with regard to the identification of the Maiteb, the\nCommission had recourse to the two reports made by the Italian negotiator\n(Major Ciccodicola). There was apparently no record of the negotiations from\nthe Ethiopian side. These two reports, the first being made immediately after\nthe signature of the treaty and the second some five weeks later, referred to a\nmap termed the Mai Daro map, which the Commission concluded was \u2018clearly\nthe map that was actually used in the discussions\u2019 and indeed was accepted as\nthe only map that the negotiators had before them.46 The Commission empha-\nsized that: \u2018A map that is known to have been used in negotiations may have\na special importance\u2019.47\nThe Commission relied on this map as part of the negotiating materials and\ndecided that there were four reasons why the Maiteb (termed the Meeteb in the\nmap but accepted by the Commission as the same river) could not have been\n764 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n42 See, eg, Eritrea\/Ethiopia Claims Commission, Partial Award, Ius Ad Bellum, Ethiopia\u2019s\nClaims 1\u20138, 19 Dec 2005; and C Gray, \u2018The Eritrea\/Ethiopia Claims Commission Oversteps Its\nBoundaries: A Partial Award?\u2019 (2006) 17 Eur J of Intl L 699.\n43 The Commission noted that Eritrea made differing submissions as to the end point of this\npart of the line, before deciding in its final submissions upon locations termed Points 7A and 7B,\nEritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission Award, para 5.15.\n44 See accompanying map 1.\n45 Eritrea\u2013Ethiopia Boundary Commission Award, para 5.1\u20135.15.\n46 ibid, paras 5.20 and 5.24, unlike other maps, ibid.\n47 ibid para 3.21.

These ranged from the direction and length of the Meeteb when\ncontrasted with the Maiteb as claimed by Ethiopia, to the difference in angle\nby which the boundary was seen to arrive at the agreed end point (Point 9).\nThis was seen as confirmed by the 1894 de Chaurand map, which was\nexpressly stated to have been the basis for the 1900 treaty map and \u2018must have\nbeen familiar to the negotiators\u2019.48 The Commission also concluded that it\ncould not \u2018identify any evidence of events in the years following 1902 to\nsuggest that the parties\u2019 actual intention to select the Meeteb of the Mai Daro\nmap was changed to the western Maiteb\u2019.49 Despite this examination, the\nCommission accepted that the identification of the Maiteb of the treaty with\nthe Meeteb in the Mai Daro and de Chaurand maps could not by itself resolve\nthe question.50 This required the Commission to turn to the other distinguish-\ning element in establishing the boundary in this sector, which was the provi-\nsion that the line be so delimited so as to include the Cunama tribe in Eritrea.\nThe Commission analysed this as part of the \u2018object and purpose\u2019 of the treaty\nand therefore as part of the tools for ascertaining the \u2018common will\u2019 of the\nparties.\nThe provision regarding the Cunama tribe indicated to the Commission that\nthe line described in the treaty was not completely defined, so that a portion of\nit remained to be delimited and that the object of this delimitation was\n\u2018precisely to ensure that the Cunama tribe belonged to Eritrea\u2019. This was\nunderstood to be a reference to \u2018at least the bulk of the Cunama tribal area, if\nnot the whole of it\u2019 and would have required a two-stage operation. First, the\nascertainment of the relevant facts concerning the domain of the Cunama and\nsecondly, the construction of a line to reflect these facts and so to place the\nCunama in Eritrea.51 Such a delimitation did not take place. The negotiating\nmaterials available to the Commission (only from the Italian side since it\nappeared that none existed from the Ethiopian side) demonstrated clearly that\nthe Cunama were to be placed within the boundaries of Eritrea.52\nThe Commission turned to a consideration of developments subsequent to\nthe treaty in order to ascertain the relevant subsequent practice of the parties.\nThe material that the Commission identified, certainly in the immediate post-\ntreaty years and thence to the early 1930s, convinced the Commission that the\nCunama inhabited the region to the east and south of Ethiopia\u2019s claim line (and\ntherefore outside of it).53 In particular, the Commission noted the Comando\ndel Corpe di Stato Maggiore map of 1904, which showed the boundary\nmoving down the Setit south-east to the river Tomsa (Point 6) and then turn-\n766 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n48 ibid para 5.26. 49 ibid para 5.43.\n50 ibid para 5.27. 51 ibid para 5.34.\n52 ibid paras 5.37\u20135.41.\n53 See, for example, the letter of Martini, the Governor of Eritrea, of 3 Aug 1902, para 5.46;\nthe Prinetti map of 10 Dec 1902, para 5.48; and the Pollara report of 17 May 1904, para 5.52.

The Commission\npointed out that this line, with the exception of an Italian map of 1905 and an\nEthiopian map of 1923, had \u2018constantly been adhered to on the maps produced\nby both Eritrea and Ethiopia\u2019.54 This element of consistent practice was to\nprove critical.\nThe Commission concluded that although Article 1 of the 1902 treaty\nreferred to a river called the Maiteb, the explicit object and purpose of the\ntreaty, namely the assignment to Eritrea of the Cunama tribe \u2018clearly indicates\nthe intention and \u201ccommon will\u201d of the parties that the boundary river should\nnot be the western Maiteb\u2019. The Commission indicated that the evidence,\nalthough inexact, indicated that the territory of the Cunama extended far to the\neast and south-east of the Ethiopian claim line; that the negotiators had suffi-\ncient knowledge to identify the general limits on the sole map which the\nevidence indicated was before them during their discussion; that this map was\nthe Mai Daro map; and that this map showed that the river called Meeteb was\nnot the western Maiteb, which could not have been intended to be the starting\npoint of the straight-line boundary to Point 9 as used by Ethiopia.55 The\nCommission considered that the river Meeteb of the Mai Daro map was really\nthe Sittona, which flowed into the Setit from the north-east at Point 4, so that\nthe Maiteb as used in the 1902 treaty was the present-day Sittona.56 It was held\nthat although three early Italian maps and one Ethiopian map of 1923 showed\nthe Ethiopian claim line, \u2018all the other relevant maps show the Eritrean claim\nline\u2019, which followed the Setit to the Tomsa at Point 6 and then followed a\nstraight line to Point 9. The Commission emphasized that there was no record\nof any timely Ethiopian objection to these maps and that there was a consis-\ntent record of Ethiopian maps showing the same boundary, and concluded that\nthese maps \u2018amount to subsequent conduct or practice of the parties evidenc-\ning their mutual acceptance of a boundary corresponding to the Eritrean claim\nline\u2019.57 The Commission also noted that \u2018the line so consistently shown on\nthese maps\u2019 evidences the acceptance by the parties of that line as the eastern\nlimit of Cunama territory transferred to Eritrea by the 1902 treaty. The\nCommission held that as at 1935, immediately prior to the Italian invasion, the\nboundary between the Setit and the Mareb had crystallized and was binding on\nthe parties along the line from Point 6 to Point 9.58 The point to be noted at\nthis stage is not that the Commission revised the clear provisions of a bound-\nary treaty in the light of subsequent practice, but that in a situation where the\ntreaty was itself unclear, the practice of the parties in question would become\ndeterminative as to what they understood the ambiguous provisions of that\nagreement to be.\nThe Experience of the Eritrea\u2013Ethiopia Boundary Commission 767\n54 ibid para 5.56. 55 ibid para 5.83.\n56 ibid para 5.85. 57 ibid para 5.88.\n58 ibid para 5.89\u20135.90.

Treaty interpretation issues arising from the 1900 treaty (the Central\nSector): the role of annexed maps\nThe treaty of 1900 delimited the Central Sector, running from the eastern point\nreached by the 1902 treaty (Point 9) to the area of the Salt Lake. In fact, the\nboundary between Point 9 to Point 12 was uncontested by the parties, as was\nthe line between Massolae (Point 27) and Rendacoma (Point 28). Article 1 of\nthe Treaty (after modification of the line from the west to Point 9) provided\nthat the boundary ran along \u2018the line from the Mareb [effectively from its junc-\ntion with Mai Ambessa]\u2014 Belesa\u2014Muna, traced on the map annexed\u2019.59 This\nterse phrase, as the Commission wryly noted\nfell short of a desirably detailed description, particularly in the light of the uncer-\ntain knowledge at the time concerning the topography of the area and the names\nto be given to geographical features. Rivers, in particular, were frequently given\ndifferent names along different stretches of their courses.60\nHowever, and unlike the other sectors of the Eritrean\u2013Ethiopian boundary, the\ntreaty had a map annexed to it. This, thus, was of \u2018critical importance\u2019 for the\ndetermination of the boundary.\nWhatever the role of maps generally with regard to territorial disputes,61 it\nhas long been clear that where a map has been formally attached or annexed\nto a boundary treaty, that map attains a significance equal to the text of the\ntreaty. The International Court declared in the Burkina Faso\/Mali case that\nwhere maps fall into the category of \u2018physical expressions of the will of the\nstate or states concerned\u2019, such as the case of maps \u2018annexed to an official text\nof which they form an integral part\u2019, then such maps may acquire legal force\nin the context of establishment of territorial rights.62 As the Commission\nnoted, maps\nmade authoritative by, for example, being annexed to a treaty as a definitive\nillustration of a boundary delimited by the treaty, are in a special category since\nthey \u2018fall into the category of physical expressions of the will of the state or states\nconcerned\u2019. The Treaty map annexed to the 1900 Treaty is such a map.63\nThe fact, therefore, that Article 1 of the treaty added to the sparse textual\ndescription of the boundary in this sector the phrase \u2018traced on the map\nannexed\u2019, meant as the Commission emphasized, that \u2018the map contained the\nParties\u2019 agreed delineation of the boundary that they intended to adopt\u2019.\nAccordingly, the Commission applied the same rules and principles of inter-\npretation of words used in the Treaty to the map.64\n768 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n59 ibid paras 4.2\u20134.4.

At that point, two rivers merged to form or join the Belesa.\nEritrea argued that the river joining from the south was the boundary river\nintended; Ethiopia argued that the river flowing in from the east was the\ncorrect river. The Commission held that the Eritrean claim could not be recon-\nciled with the treaty map boundary since on the map the name \u2018T Belesa\u2019 was\nwritten as covering both the main stretch of the river and its eastward exten-\nsion (termed by the Commission Belesa B), thus demonstrating what the\nparties to the treaty had intended by the word \u2018Belesa\u2019. Similarly, the Eritrean\nclaim would not have given any role to the tributary that joins Belesa B from\nthe east at Point 13 (termed Belesa C by the Commission), which the treaty\nmap had clearly used as part of the boundary.65\nThe parties also disagreed as to the identity of the river Muna, referred to\nin Article 1 of the treaty.66 Ethiopia proposed that, in view of the inconsisten-\ncies contained in the map, the river termed Muna on the map was in reality the\nEndeli and the river depicted in the position of what is called the Muna was\nanother river, the Berbero Gado. Ethiopia also pointed to confusion after 1900\nover the location of the river designation \u2018Muna\u2019, in particular in relation to\nthe Endeli and Berbero Gado.67 Eritrea argued that the river identified on the\nmap as \u2018T Mai Muna\u2019, with its headwaters south of Barachit, constituted the\nboundary and that there was a river with that name in that place so that this\nriver was the boundary.68 The district of Irob was thus in dispute between the\nparties. Faced with this, the Commission emphasized that the key issue\nconcerning the problem of names in the area in question was to determine\nwhat the parties intended \u2018of which the principal evidence is what they said in\nthe Treaty and, more particularly, illustrated in the Treaty map\u2019. The\nCommission held that it was clear that the parties had agreed to a treaty which\nreferred to the Muna and that the treaty map showed a boundary line follow-\ning a river, designated as the Muna, flowing from south of Barachit and\nrunning generally east-south-east towards the Salt Lake. This, therefore, had\nto be taken to represent what the parties intended, especially as the existence\nof the river Muna in the area in question was known to the parties and indeed\nhad been referred to in the armistice arrangement of March 1896 and the peace\ntreaty of later that year.69 Had the parties intended the boundary to follow the\ncourse of the Endeli, a river known at the time of the treaty, they would have\nsaid so. 70 It was common practice, noted the Commission, for different\nstretches of a waterway to bear different names, so that the use of \u2018T Mai\nThe Experience of the Eritrea\u2013Ethiopia Boundary Commission 769\n65 ibid paras 4.16\u20134.21.\n66 This river was known by different names at different points until it reached, or became\nknown at some point as, the Endeli and Ragali rivers. The Endeli, however, commenced from\nfurther north, but was not shown on the treaty map until its lower reaches, which is called the\nMuna on the map. This then flows into the Ragali and thence to the Salt Lake.\n67 ibid paras 4.27\u20134.29. 68 ibid para 4.31.\n69 ibid para 4.35. 70 ibid para 4.33.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Aug 2013 IP address: 143.210.121.140\nMuna\u2019 to designate the whole waterway (and thus the stretches of the Muna,\nEndeli and Ragali) was merely a matter of \u2018simplification and convenience\nacceptable to the Parties\u2019.71 The Commission concluded by noting the fact the\nmap was to be followed: \u2018so long as it is not shown to be at variance with\nmodern knowledge as to render it valueless as an indicator of what the Parties\ncould have intended on the ground\u2019. It was also important not to attribute \u2018far-\nreaching consequences to relatively minor discrepancies\u2019.72\nThe parties also disputed the location of the eastern terminal point of the\n1900 treaty boundary. In dealing with this, the Commission raised two issues.\nFirst, the Commission considered the work of the 1904 Commission which\nhad been charged with examining part of the boundary covered by the 1900\ntreaty. The 1904 Commission concluded that its own mission terminated at\nMassolae,73 something that the Commission noted was not based on either\nArticle 1 of the treaty or the treaty map. While it was accepted that the work\nof the 1904 Commission could constitute evidence as to the intentions of the\nparties with regard to Article 1, it was emphasized that this was essentially an\nItalian commission with an Ethiopian observer who did not sign the final\nreport and without agreed terms of reference. It could not, therefore, be seen\nas expressing the shared views of the parties.74 The Commission thus under-\nlined the importance, while considering the relevant practice of the parties\nconcerning the interpretation of a treaty, of taking account of all the pertinent\ncircumstances and, accordingly, not over-emphasizing material emanating\nfrom, and with the authority of, one side alone, particularly, one may add,\nwhere the other party was involved and failed to accept or approve it.\nSecondly, the Commission had to deal with the situation that the river\nMuna (known as the Ragali at this stretch) did not flow clearly into the Salt\nLake. The river reached a point to the north of the Lake and then split into \u2018a\nfiligree network of small channels and streams, with no readily identifiable\nsingle and regular river bed\u2019.75 This was reflected in the fact that on the map\nthe previous continuous blue line marking the river became a dotted blue line\nin the final part of the river system.76 It was thus not possible to define the\nboundary simply in terms of the river at this point. Faced with this, the\nCommission decided that from Point 29 the boundary in the delta would be\nbased upon straight lines linking Points 29, 30 and 31, the latter point being on\n770 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n71 ibid para 4.34. See also ibid para 4.44.\n72 ibid para 4.36. As an example of this approach, the Commission, in dealing with the over-\nland link between the Belesa and the Muna, held with respect to the Ethiopian claim as to the river\nboundary that it was \u2018unable to read the Treaty as establishing a boundary so at variance with the\nTreaty map as to involve a longer and less direct overland sector than that which the map shows\u2019,\nibid para 4.41.\n73 Eritrea argued that the eastern terminal point was at Massolae, ibid para 4.45.\n74 ibid para 4.48 and Appendix A, paras A1 and A2.\n75 ibid para 4.52.\n76 ibid. The Commission noted that while this was unexplained on the treaty map, on the under-\nlying de Chaurand map, the legend stated that a dotted blue line signified an uncertain river\ncourse.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Aug 2013 IP address: 143.210.121.140\nthe shores of the Salt Lake.77 This is consistent with prior jurisprudence. In the\nBurkina Faso\/Mali case, for example, the Chamber of the International Court\ndrew a straight line across the Pool of Soum \u2018in the absence of any precise\nindication in the texts of the position of the frontier line\u2019.78\n4. Treaty interpretation issues arising from the 1908 treaty (the Eastern\nSector): the role of geometric delimitation\nArticle 1 of the 1908 treaty delimited the boundary from the \u2018most easterly\npoint of the frontier established . . . by the Treaty of 10th July 1900\u2019 to the\n\u2018frontier of the French possessions of Somalia\u2019. This provision determined that\nfrom the former point \u2018the boundary continues south-east, parallel to and at a\ndistance of 60 kilometres from the coast\u2019. As the Commission noted, this\nestablished a geometric method of delimitation.79 The treaty also provided for\na demarcation as soon as possible, adapting the agreed frontier line \u2018to the\nnature and variation of the terrain\u2019,80 and for the parties to establish \u2018the\nrespective dependence of the tribes bordering the frontier on the basis of their\ntraditional and usual residence\u2019.81 Article IV provided that the two govern-\nments undertook \u2018to recognise reciprocally the ancient rights and prerogatives\nof the tribes bordering the frontier without regard to their political depen-\ndence\u2019. The Commission understood this as reinforcing the primacy of the\ngeometric method of delimitation and as establishing that: \u2018Prior effectivit\u00e9s,\nwhich might have been adduced to determine the location of the boundary, are\nrecognised prospectively only as the basis for transboundary rights, but are not\nto play a role in the calculation as to where the boundary is located\u2019.82\nThis approach of the Commission to the provision of a geometric method\nof delimitation constitutes a valuable discussion of both methodology and\nsubstance with regard to the geometric basis of boundary delimitation. It did\nnot mean, as Eritrea argued, that all the Commission had to do was to apply\nthe delimitation to a map of the area. The Commission determined that what\nhad been provided was \u2018a formula, the application of which required a series\nof subsidiary decisions on other critical matters, eg the meaning to be attrib-\nuted to the word \u201ccoast\u201d in Article 1, and the point at which the boundary was\nto commence\u2019. It was a process \u2018of both delimitation and demarcation\u2019.83\nHowever, departures from the geometric method in the demarcation process\nwould only be permissible to take account of the \u2018nature and variation of the\nterrain\u2019. The Commission emphasized that the effect of Articles II and IV of\nThe Experience of the Eritrea\u2013Ethiopia Boundary Commission 771\n77 But see later as to post-decision practice, p 789.\n78 Burkina Faso\/Mali (n 1) 554, 633.

Accordingly, the geometric method-\nology required by the treaty excluded any consideration of pre-1908 effectiv-\nit\u00e9s \u2018with adjustments to the geometric line to be made only to take account of\nthe nature and variation of the terrain\u2019.84\nThe Commission held that the starting point of the 1908 boundary line,\nbeing the most easterly point of the 1900 treaty, was Point 31, the point at\nwhich the river Muna reached the Salt Lake via straight lines.85 The end point\nwas stated to be \u2018the point, 60 km. from the coast, where the boundary line\nmeets the frontier of Djibouti\u2019. The Commission took the view that the exact\nlocation of this end point (Point 41) was a matter to be addressed in the demar-\ncation phase, \u2018taking account of the nature and variation of the terrain as well\nas the precision made possible by large-scale survey maps\u2019.86 The parties\nagreed that the definition of \u2018coast\u2019 referred to \u2018the line adhering to the conti-\nnent itself, and not any coastlines of islands\u2019.87\nThe parties differed as to how to manifest the geometric method.88 The\nCommission concluded that both the methods proposed by the parties, which\nproduced congruent or nearly congruent results in many sectors of the\nproposed boundary, imported a measure of subjective choice, even though\nthey purported to be objective.89 The Commission proposed instead the taking\nof a satellite image of the coastline of Eritrea in the area covered by the 1908\nboundary and the transposition of this inland to a distance of 60 kilometres.\nThis would be accompanied by the drawing of a straight line from the\nEritrean\u2013Djibouti boundary at the point at which it meets the coast to the point\nin the north-west on the coast opposite the eastern terminus of the 1900 treaty,\nwhich would produce a line describing the general direction of the coast in this\nsector. In order to determine the appropriate point on the coast at the eastern\nterminus of the 1900 treaty, an arc with a radius of 60 kilometres would be\ndrawn from Point 31. The drawing of two lines, each 60 kilometres long would\nthen be projected perpendicularly from each end of this line and this would\nconstitute the points inland upon which the satellite image of the coast may be\nset. This would produce a line, every point of which would be exactly 60 kilo-\nmetres inland from the nearest point on the coast. Each sinuosity of the coast\nwould be reproduced exactly on this inland line and each would be precisely\n60 kilometres inland from the corresponding sinuosity on the coast.90\nThe Experience of the Eritrea\u2013Ethiopia Boundary Commission 773\n84 ibid para 6.17.

Eritrea had argued at one point that \u2018coast\u2019 included islands, ibid.\n88 Eritrea proposed the application of the arcs of circles method in order to produce a simpli-\nfied representation of the coast which would then be moved inland for the prescribed 60 kilome-\ntres. Ethiopia suggest the creation of a construct of the coast at the coastline which would then be\nmoved inland 60 kilometres and then readjusted to take account of certain problems inherent in\nthe method itself and then further readjusted in order to adapt it to the nature and variation of the\nground, ibid para 6.20.\n89 ibid. 90 ibid para 6.21.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Aug 2013 IP address: 143.210.121.140\nHowever, the Commission noted that this replication of the coast on the\ninland 60 kilometre line \u2018does not produce a manageable boundary\u2019 and\npointed out that the parties had indicated to it that such adjustments in the\nboundary as would be necessary to render it manageable and rational should\nbe made. Accordingly, the Commission designated nine points to assist in this\nproject.91 The delimitation line thus produced, with one exception arising out\nof post-1908 effectivit\u00e9s,92 would \u2018serve as the basis for the demarcation, leav-\ning open the possibility at that stage of \u201cadapting it to the nature and variation\nof the terrain\u201d, as contemplated in Article II of that Treaty\u2019.93\nC. The Conduct of the Parties\n1. Resort to pre-treaty materials\nThe Arbitral Tribunal in the Argentina\/Chile Frontier case noted that the\nprocess of interpretation, which focuses on seeking the \u2018common will\u2019 of the\nparties, may be aided by recourse to preparatory documents or subsequent\naction of the parties.94 The Commission took into account a number of pre-\ntreaty materials in seeking to ascertain the meaning of particular treaty provi-\nsions, both materials used in the negotiating process leading to the adoption of\nthe particular treaty provision in question and earlier relevant materials that\nwere not part of the negotiation process. The fact that circumstances might\ndictate when pre-treaty materials could be pertinent was emphasized by the\nCommission when it decided not to look at the conduct of the parties prior to\nthe conclusion of the 1908 treaty. This was because \u2018the terms of the treaty\nmake it clear that the parties intended that the effect of such activities should\nnot be taken into account\u2019.95 There was no such provision in the 1900 and\n1902 treaties. Further, the Commission noted that the fact that the 1896\narmistice between Italy and Ethiopia provided that until a peace treaty was\nsigned the border between the parties would be maintained at the \u2018Mareb,\nBelesa and Muna, which is the border of the Agame and Okologezay\u2019 and that\nin Article IV of the peace treaty later that year the parties agreed to observe\nthe status quo ante, did not mean that the 1900 treaty had to be interpreted as\nhaving as its object and purpose the maintenance of the division between\nAcchele Guzai and Agame.96 The Commission also observed that diplomatic\nexchanges of a decade before the conclusion of the 1900 treaty were not part\nof the negotiations for it.97\n774 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n91 ibid para 6.22.\n92 See below, p 782.\n93 ibid para 6.34.\n94 Argentina\/Chile (n 24) 10, 89 (the Palena case).

The de Chaurand map of 1894\nThis map was discussed in the context both of the 1900 treaty (concerning the\nCentral Sector) and the 1902 treaty (concerning the Western Sector). In the\nformer case, a map was annexed to the treaty.98 This treaty map stated that it\nwas based upon de Chaurand\u2019s map of the relevant area and the Commission\nnoted that: \u2018it is apparent that the Treaty map was in fact a tracing or other\ndirect copy of the relevant part of the de Chaurand map, omitting certain\nfeatures so as to give prominence to the features most relevant to the 1900\nTreaty line\u2019. The Commission thus concluded that: \u2018Depictions on de\nChaurand\u2019s map are therefore directly relevant to an understanding of the\nTreaty map\u2019.99\nThe Commission had recourse to the de Chaurand map in interpreting the\ntreaty map with regard to the omission from the latter of the Tserona river as\nshown on the former. It was concluded that this omission was deliberate in\nestablishing that the Belesa river continued eastwards and not southwards.\nAccordingly, Eritrea\u2019s argument that the eastwards branch of the river (termed\nby the Commission Belesa B) was meant to depict the Tserona, so that the\nsouthwards branch (Belesa A) was intended to be the Belesa boundary, was\ndismissed.100 The Commission also used the de Chaurand map, which termed\nstretches of the Muna river as the \u2018Maj Mena\u2019, the Endeli and the Ragali,\nwhereas the treaty map simply referred to the Muna, as emphasizing that\ndifferent names may reflect different stretches for the same watercourse. The\nimportance of this was that although the different names of the watercourse\nmust have been known to the parties, the fact that the treaty map referred only\nto the Muna underlined that this was intended as the boundary as stated in the\ntext of the treaty and constituted \u2018a cartographic simplification for the\npurposes of the boundary treaty\u2019.101 The de Chaurand map was further used\nby the Commission to explain the meaning of a dotted blue line marking the\nfinal stages of the river system leading to the Salt Lake, following on from a\ncontinuous blue line. While the treaty map of 1900 had no explanation of this\nchange, what the Commission termed \u2018the underlying de Chaurand map\u2019\nexplained in the legend that a dotted blue line meant an uncertain river\nsystem.102\nThe Experience of the Eritrea\u2013Ethiopia Boundary Commission 775\n98 See above, p 768.\n99 Eritrea\u2013Ethiopia Boundary Commission Award, para 4.9.\n100 ibid paras 4.17\u20134.22.\n101 ibid paras 4.34 and 4.44.\n102 ibid para 4.52. The Commission also referred to the de Chaurand map in the context of its\nconsideration of the 1902 treaty concerning the Western Sector. The Commission attributed great\nimportance to the Mai Daro map, see above, p 764 and the following subsection. It was also stated\nthat: \u2018The significance and evidentiary weight of the Mai Daro map is confirmed by its similarity\nwith the de Chaurand map of 1894\u2019, ibid para 5.26.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Aug 2013 IP address: 143.210.121.140\nii. The Ciccodicola reports and the Mai Daro map\nIn seeking to determine what was meant by the reference in Article 1(ii) of the\n1902 treaty to the Maiteb, the Commission paid particular attention to the two\nreports of Major Ciccodicola, dated 16 May 1902 and 28 June 1902, both close\nto the date of the treaty, which was 15 May 1902. Ciccodicola was the Italian\nnegotiator. No record of the negotiations from Ethiopia\u2019s negotiator, Emperor\nMenelik, apparently existed. Ciccodicola\u2019s two reports referred specifically to\na map termed by the Commission the Mai Daro map. The Commission\nattached importance to the Mai Daro map since it was clear from\nCiccodicola\u2019s reports that this map was the only one before the negotiators.\nAccordingly, it displaced other maps that had placed the Maiteb at Point 3.103\nThe Commission also resorted to the Ciccodicola reports in the context of\nestablishing the object of the treaty as ensuring that the Cunama tribe and\nvillages became part of Eritrea.104\n2. Subsequent conduct of the parties\nThe subsequent conduct of the parties may be relevant in a number of ways:\nfirst, as a method of determining the true interpretation of the relevant bound-\nary instrument in the sense of the \u2018common will\u2019 of the parties;105 secondly,\nas a method of resolving an uncertain disposition or situation, for example,\nwhether a particular area did or did not fall within colonial territory for the\npurposes of determining the uti possidetis line;106 or thirdly, as a method of\nmodifying a boundary treaty itself in certain circumstances.\ni. The role and scope of relevant conduct\nThe Commission has provided a careful analysis of subsequent practice of\nsome significance. It was emphasized that the function of such practice goes\nbeyond the interpretation of treaties, as such,107 and may affect the legal rela-\ntions between the parties. It was noted that:\nthe effect of subsequent conduct may be so clear in relation to matters that appear\nto be the subject of a given treaty that the application of an otherwise pertinent\ntreaty provision may be varied, or may even cease to control the situation,\nregardless of its original meaning.108\nThe interposition of the phrase \u2018so clear\u2019 needs to be particularly noted in this\ncontext as some have criticized the Commission\u2019s decision as upsetting the\n776 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n103 ibid paras 5.19\u20135.24.

However, what is at issue here is the question of\nproof, both the onus and the standard of proof. A treaty title is determinative,\nsubject to evidence to the contrary, so that the party alleging a modification of\na clear treaty line must prove that the two (or more) parties directly involved\nhave indeed by their conduct agreed to such modification. Clearly, the\npresumption will always be that a clear treaty provision stands. It will take\nundisputed evidence to displace this and such evidence must focus upon the\nbehaviour of the relevant parties. Too facile an acceptance of conduct revision\nwould undermine the necessary primacy of boundary treaties, while to ignore\nthe clear intention of the parties could import instability and harm. On the\nother hand, of course, the degree of subsequent conduct required to produce a\ndetermination in the face of an ambiguous treaty provision would necessarily\nbe of a different order.\nSubsequent conduct may be defined or discussed in terms of a number of\ndifferent contexts and concepts, including, for example, recognition, estoppel,\npreclusion, acquiescence or implied agreement, where the essential elements\nwere identical.110 The Commission also noted, citing the Taba case,111 that: \u2018a\nclear treaty provision may be varied by the conduct of the Parties\u2019.112 The\nCommission identified three relevant categories of the conduct of the parties:\nmaps, effectivit\u00e9s and diplomatic and other similar exchanges and records\nconstituting assertions of sovereignty or acquiescence in or opposition to such\nassertions by the other party.113\nii.

It declared that:\nThe effect of a map that is not part of a treaty will vary according to its prove-\nnance, its scale and cartographic quality, its consistency with other maps, the use\nmade of it by the parties, the degree of publicity accorded to it and the extent to\nwhich, if at all, it was adopted or acquiesced in by the parties adversely affected\nby it, or the extent to which it is contrary to the interests of the party that\nproduced it.117\nA map known to have been used in negotiations \u2018may have a special impor-\ntance\u2019,118 an approach that the Commission indeed adopted with regard to the\nMai Daro map.119 A map emanating from third parties (depending on the\ncircumstances), or one on so small a scale that its import is speculative, \u2018is\nunlikely to have great legal or evidentiary value\u2019, although where the third-\nparty map was one so closely bearing upon its interests that, to the extent that\nit might be erroneous, \u2018it might reasonably have been expected that the state\naffected would have brought the error to the attention of the state which made\nthe map and would have sought its rectification\u2019. Further, a map produced by\nan official government agency of a party, on a scale sufficient to enable its\nportrayal of the disputed boundary area to be identifiable and generally avail-\nable and \u2018acted upon, or not reacted to\u2019 by the adversely affected party, \u2018can\nbe expected to have significant legal consequences\u2019.120\nThe Commission emphasized that in such cases it was not the maps alone\nwhich could produce legally significant effects, but rather the maps in associ-\nation with other circumstances, being the basis, for example, of acquiescence\nand thus of great legal significance.121 Where the map evidence is not uniform\nor consistent, it would be treated as ambiguous,122 unless one map or maps\npossessed a clearly greater weight.123\nThe Commission addressed the question of the \u2018signature\u2019 of a map, that is,\nits general shape, silhouette, contour or outline, as distinct from its particular\ndetails, with justifiable caution, noting that such signature may not be of suffi-\n778 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n115 ibid para 4.8.\n116 ibid para 3.20 and see above, p 768.\n117 ibid para 3.21.

There was no\nrecord of any timely Ethiopian objection to these maps and there was a consis-\ntent record of Ethiopian maps showing the same boundary. Accordingly, the\nCommission concluded that these maps \u2018amount to subsequent conduct or\npractice of the Parties evidencing their mutual acceptance of a boundary corre-\nsponding to the Eritrean claim line\u2019.125 Further, the Commission noted that\n\u2018the line so consistently shown on these maps\u2019 could serve to evidence the\nacceptance by the parties of that line as the eastern limit of Cunama territory,\ntransferred to Eritrea by the 1902 treaty.126\nThe Commission distinguished between establishing a boundary using such\na signature and confirming an established boundary by such means, and\nbetween using a signature in a confirmatory way and using it negatively to\ndemonstrate that a boundary does not exist elsewhere. Map evidence may also\nneed to be considered separately in relation to different parts of the bound-\nary.127\niii.

The Commission also clarified the meaning of the various disclaimer terms\nthat appear on maps that show that the map itself is not taken by the party preparing it (whether a\nState or the United Nations, for example) as authoritative. It was held that such disclaimers do not\nautomatically deprive a map of all evidential value since the map \u2018still stands as an indication that,\nat the time and place the map was made, a cartographer took a particular view of the features\nappearing on the map\u2019. The disclaimer simply means that legal recognition has not been accorded\nby the body making the map to the titles or boundaries shown. Nor can a disclaimer relieve a State\nadversely affected of the need to protest, depending upon the character of the map and the signif-\nicance of the feature shown. The map would stand as a statement of geographical fact \u2018especially\nwhere the state adversely affected has itself produced and disseminated it, even against its own\ninterest\u2019.

Such subse-\nquent practice consisted of maps, official documentation and administrative\nmeasures.131 Relying primarily upon a significant consistency of maps, both\nItalian and Ethiopian, the Commission concluded that by 1935 the boundary\nbetween the Setit and the Mareb had crystallized and was binding on the\nparties along the line from Point 6 to Point 9.132 The Commission examined\nthe major events after 1935 and until the independence of Eritrea and took the\nview that the \u2018boundary of 1935 remained the boundary of today\u2019.133 The\nCommission declared that it had given \u2018careful consideration\u2019 to Ethiopian\nevidence of its activities in the area west of Eritrea\u2019s claim line (which\nincludes the present-day village of Badme). It was specifically noted that no\nevidence of such activities appeared in the Ethiopian Memorial and that it was\nintroduced only in the Ethiopian Counter-Memorial and not added to or devel-\noped in the Ethiopian Reply,134 the necessary implication being no doubt that\nthe Commission could only consider such evidence as was placed before it.\nThe Commission noted that the area of claimed Ethiopian administrative\nactivity comprised, at the most, one-fifth of the disputed area and did not\n780 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n129 The Commission declared that: \u2018the actions of a state pursued \u00e0 titre de souverain can play\na role, either as assertive of that state\u2019s position or, expressly or impliedly, contradictory of the\nconduct of the opposing state. Such actions may comprise legislative, administrative or judicial\nassertions of authority over the disputed area. There is no set standard of duration and intensity of\nsuch activity. Its effect depends on the nature of the terrain and the extent of its population, the\nperiod during which it has been carried on and the extent of any contradictory conduct (including\nprotests) of the opposing state. It is also important to bear in mind that conduct does not by itself\nproduce an absolute and indefeasible title, but only a title relative to that of the competing state.\nThe conduct of one party must be measured against that of the other. Eventually, but not neces-\nsarily so, the legal result may be to vary a boundary established by a treaty\u2019, ibid para 3.29.\n130 ibid paras 4.65, 4.74, 4.80, 4.88, 5.92\u20135.95, and 6.25\u20136.32.\n131 ibid paras 5.44\u20135.90. 132 ibid para 5.90.\n133 ibid para 5.91. 134 ibid para 5.92.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Aug 2013 IP address: 143.210.121.140\nextend in any significant way towards the Eritrean claim line. In addition, the\ndates of Ethiopian conduct related to only a small part of the period since 1902\nand essentially dated from 1951 (apart from references to sporadic friction in\n1929\u20131932 at Acqua Morchiti). The Commission concluded that it did not find\nin the elements itemized by Ethiopia \u2018evidence of administration of the area\nsufficiently clear in location, substantial in scope or extensive in time to\ndisplace the title of Eritrea that had crystallised as of 1935\u2019.135\nIn the Central Sector, the Commission found in general that the evidence of\neffectivit\u00e9s was mixed and that no departure from the 1900 treaty boundary\nline was justified apart from in two places. The Commission held itself satis-\nfied, in a statement that may be criticized as rather too cryptic, that: \u2018the\nevidence of Eritrean activity is sufficient, in terms of administrative range,\nquantity, area and period, to justify treating the Acran region as part of\nEritrea.\u2019136 With regard to the town of Zalambessa, which had not existed in\n1900, the Commission took note of the establishment of a customs post,\nagreed by both parties to be 2 kilometres north of the town137 and held that the\nlocation of such a post on one side of the town strongly suggested that the\nboundary was on the same side of the town \u2018since to have a population centre\nbetween a boundary and a border customs post would be unusual\u2019. Ethiopia\nhas also submitted evidence showing that that the customs authorities of\nEritrea regularly had dealings with the nearby Ethiopian customs post in such\na way as to accept Zalambessa as part of Ethiopia. In addition, in an exchange\nin 1996, Eritrea had referred to an Ethiopian request to allow a survey team\ninto its territory as being incidental to the task of \u2018rechecking border delineat-\ning points in Zalambessa area (Tigray region)\u2019. Accordingly, the Commission\nadjusted the 1900 boundary line so as to place Zalambessa in Ethiopian terri-\ntory.138 The basic reason for this appeared to have been the \u2018considerable\nnumber of significant administrative activities by Ethiopian authorities\u2019, there\ncoupled with Eritrean acknowledgment that the town fell within Ethiopia.\nIn the part of the Central Sector between the Muna\/Berbero Grado river and\nthe upper reaches of the Endeli (termed the Endeli projection by the\nCommission), the Commission concluded that, although Ethiopia had\npresented the stronger evidence of administrative activity, the impact of\nEritrean activity was stronger in the northern and western fringes of the Endeli\nprojection and that Ethiopia had not established its effective sovereignty to the\nrequired degree over those areas. Accordingly, the Commission held that the\nThe Experience of the Eritrea\u2013Ethiopia Boundary Commission 781\n135 ibid paras 5.93\u20135.95.\n136 ibid para 4.71.

Eritrea produced\nevidence of an express agreement between the parties, with corresponding\nperformance which appears to have placed the border at Bure. The agreement\nwas signed by both parties on 7 November 1994, incorporating a report of 12\nJuly 1994. Part of the report noted that the main checkpoints along the Addis-\nAssab corridor included \u2018Bure Ethiopian border\u2019 and \u2018Bure Eritrean border\u2019.\nThis was reinforced by an internal Eritrean memorandum of 30 April 1994\n(copied to the Ethiopian Embassy in Asmara) that referred to Ethiopian trucks\n\u2018entering Eritrea through the checkpoints both in Zalambessa and Burre\u2019.142\nThe Commission thus concluded that both parties had agreed that their\ncommon border was placed at Bure and accordingly held that the boundary\n\u2018passes equidistantly the checkpoints of the two parties\u2019.143\niv. Diplomatic and other similar exchanges\nThe Commission interestingly included diplomatic and other similar\nexchanges \u2018constituting assertions of sovereignty, or acquiescence in or oppo-\nsition to such assertions, by the other party\u2019 as a third category of subsequent\nconduct, thus differentiating these from effectivit\u00e9s.144 This category was held\nto include \u2018assertions or admissions made in the course of the proceedings\nbefore a tribunal\u2019.145 The Commission referred here in particular to Ethiopian\nstatements in its Reply, noting that \u2018Fort Cadorna . . . and Tserona\u2019 were\n\u2018mostly . . . undisputed Eritrean places\u2019. The Commission interpreted this\nstatement, made formally in a written pleading, as an \u2018admission of which the\nCommission must take full account\u2019. Accordingly, the 1900 treaty line was\nadjusted so as to include Fort Cadorna and Tserona in Eritrean territory.146\n782 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n139 ibid paras 4.84\u20134.85.\n140 ibid para 6.25.\n141 ibid paras 6.25\u20136.29.\n142 ibid para 6.30.

Conclusion as to title and subsequent conduct\nThe Chamber of the International Court declared in its seminal statement as to\nthe relationship of title and effectivit\u00e9s in the Burkina Faso\/Mali case that\nwhere the effectivit\u00e9s in question correspond to the legal title, the former serve\nsimply to confirm the latter and that where the act does not correspond to the\nlaw, so that one State is exercising sovereign authority in the territory of\nanother State holding title, preference is to be given to the latter. Where the\neffectivit\u00e9s do not coexist with any legal title, then the former must be taken\ninto account, while effectivit\u00e9s will, however, play an essential role in inter-\npreting title where the latter is in the circumstances ambiguous.150 This is\nclear: title, usually established by treaty, is paramount and constitutes the rele-\nvant delimitation. However, this does not mean that an ambiguous provision\ncannot be settled through the subsequent practice of the parties, nor that the\nparties themselves may not subsequently decide to modify that provision.\nThe delimitation decision by the Eritrea\u2013Ethiopia Commission dealt with\nthese issues in a considered fashion. In most of the situations it examined, it\nconcluded that either the effectivit\u00e9s in question were ambiguous or insufficient\nto modify title. Where the title was unclear or undetermined, particularly with\nregard to the part of the Western Sector dealt with by the 1902 treaty (from\nPoint 6 to Point 9), the Commission decided that the conduct of the parties up\nto the date of the crystallization of title by 1935 (the date of the Italian invasion\nof Abyssinia) led to the conclusion that a straight line from Point 6 to Point 9\nhad been accepted by the parties and that the post-crystallization practice was\ninsufficient to alter this.\nThe Experience of the Eritrea\u2013Ethiopia Boundary Commission 783\n147 ibid paras 5.46\u20135.81 and see also above, p 767.\n148 ibid para 4.75 and above, p 781.\n149 ibid para 6.30 and above, p 782. Not specifically characterized by the Commission, but\naccepted as an example of the modification of an earlier treaty boundary point by subsequent prac-\ntice, was the location of the western tripoint between Eritrea, Ethiopia and Sudan. Stated in Art I\n(ii) of the 1902 treaty to lie at \u2018the junction of the Khor Um Hagar with the Setit\u2019, the Commission\nheld that this was modified to \u2018the bend of the Setit immediately opposite the mouth of the Khor\nRhoyan\u2019 by the operation of the Sudan\u2013Eritrea agreements of 22 November 1901,18 February\n1903 (the relevant part being referred to as the Talbot\/Martinelli demarcation), and 1 Feb 1916\nand the Ethiopian acceptance of the Talbot\/Martinelli demarcation by an Exchange of Notes of 18\nJuly 1972. As this was not challenged by the parties and as no monument marking the tripoint was\nfound, the Commission adopted its description in the delimitation decision as the first boundary\npoint on the demarcation line, see Commission\u2019s Comments on its Statement of 27 Nov 2006,\npara 1, see below, p **.\n150 Burkina Faso\/Mali (n 1) 554, 586\u20137. See also the El Salvador\/Honduras (Nicaragua\nIntervening) case (n 1) 398 and Cameroon v Nigeria (n 1) paras 68\u201370.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Aug 2013 IP address: 143.210.121.140\nHowever, the Commission did accept that the legal title as laid down in the\nappropriate treaty could be modified where the parties had, impliedly or\nexplicitly, so agreed. The Commission found this with regard to Zalambessa,\nFort Cadorna and Bure. In each case, the Commission concluded that the\nparties had accepted by their subsequent conduct a change in the treaty line.\nThis was a possibility that the International Court supported a few months\nlater in Cameroon v Nigeria. In that decision, the Court, while noting that it\nwas not able to modify the course of a boundary established by a delimitation\nagreement, concluded that in the Sapeo area the parties had accepted that this\narea lay within Nigerian territory contrary to the text of the agreement.151 The\nCourt declared, during the course of an examination of the situation around\nLake Chad, that the fact that one State might acquiesce in the establishment of\na change in treaty title could not be \u2018wholly precluded as a possibility in\nlaw\u2019.152 This confirmed the view expressed by the Court in the El\nSalvador\/Honduras case that the established boundaries of the States\nconcerned could be varied between them by agreement and that \u2018some forms\nof activity, or inactivity, might amount to acquiescence in a boundary other\nthan that of 1821 [established by virtue of uti possidetis]\u2019.153\nThe decision of the Commission therefore reinforces the view that effectiv-\nit\u00e9s operate most decisively where there is some doubt or ambiguity as to the\nline of the particular boundary treaty and that a modification in the valid treaty\nline by the parties is possible, but that clear evidence of acceptance by the\nparties is required.\nIII. DEMARCATION\nA. At the Delimitation Stage\nWhile delimitation is the determination of the boundary line, by treaty or\notherwise, and its expression in written terms, demarcation is the physical\ndemonstration of the delimitation on the ground by means of boundary posts\nand the like. It is a distinction that has been accepted by international tribunals\nas well as writers.154 The December Agreement gave the Commission the\nmandate to demarcate the colonial treaty border based on the pertinent colo-\nnial treaties and applicable international law, but no power to decide ex aequo\net bono.155 The Commission was to proceed to an \u2018expeditious demarca-\ntion\u2019156 and the demarcation decision, like the delimitation decision was to be\n784 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n151 Cameroon v Nigeria (n 1) para 144.\n152 ibid para 68.\n153 El Salvador\/Honduras (n 1) 351, 408\u20139.\n154 See, eg, the Argentine\/Chile award of 1966 (n 24).

However, \u2018the current outer edge\u2019 of this town would\nbe determined \u2018more precisely\u2019 during the demarcation phase.160 With regard\nto the use of small-scale maps in the decision, the Commission stated that a\ndefinitive map of the whole boundary on a scale of 1:25,000 would be\nproduced on a sector-by-sector basis as each sector was finally demarcated\nand the exact coordinates of the locations of the boundary markers were deter-\nmined.161\nIt is also interesting to note that the Commission held that the question of\nthe location of the Eastern Sector boundary with its geometric criterion was\none of both delimitation and demarcation,162 so that the line of delimitation\ndecided by the Commission (apart from Bure, accepted by the parties to lie on\nthe border) would \u2018serve as the basis for the demarcation, leaving open the\npossibility at that stage of \u201cadapting it to the nature and variation of the\nterrain\u201d, as contemplated in Article II of that Treaty [of 1908]\u2019.163 The\nCommission also noted that the exact location of the point at which the bound-\nary meets the frontier of Djibouti was a matter for specification in the demar-\ncation phase.164\nThe Experience of the Eritrea\u2013Ethiopia Boundary Commission 785\n157 Art 4 (15).\n158 See Eritrea\u2013Ethiopia Boundary Commission Award, para 3.37 and Art 4(13) of the\nDecember Agreement.\n159 Eritrea\u2013Ethiopia Boundary Commission Award, para 8.1 B (iv).\n160 ibid para 8.1 B (vi).

The reason for this was because of the \u2018limited availability at the\npresent stage of information on the maps available to the Commission\u2019.

After the Delimitation Award: Demarcation and Implementation\nProblems\nThe situation following the rendering of the delimitation award by the\nBoundary Commission on 13 April 2002 has generated substantial practice,\nmuch of it of great interest with regard to the differences between the delimi-\ntation and demarcation processes. It also reveals graphically the problems\nfaced by a tribunal with a jurisdiction continuing beyond the delimitation deci-\nsion where the parties fail signally to cooperate as required. As such it may\nconceivably mark the end of an interesting experiment.\nAs of the date of writing, the President of the Commission has issued 22\nreports on the work of the Commission,165 while the Commission has itself\nmade a number of subsequent binding decisions and the Security Council has\nadopted a number of resolutions on the dispute. In particular, the subsequent\npractice of the Commission has led to a number of important statements as to,\nfor example, the delimitation decision, the scope and nature of demarcation,\nthe question of interpretation and the responsibility of the parties both gener-\nally and particularly with regard to the period between delimitation and\ndemarcation. Ultimately at its meeting in November 2006, the Commission,\nfaced with the lack of necessary cooperation by the parties \u2018extending over\nmore than four years\u2019, decided to act unilaterally with regard to the demarca-\ntion line.166\nThe Commission\u2019s delimitation decision was circulated by the UN\nSecretary-General,167 and the demarcation process was commenced soon after\nthe decision, but had to be suspended due to the Government of Ethiopia\u2019s\nprohibition of further work in its territory on 27 April 2002.168 The\nCommission emphasized that the responsibility for the demarcation rested\nwith it under Articles 4(2) and (14) of the December Agreement and Article\n30(2) of the Rules of Procedure.169 On 13 May 2002, the Commission\nreceived a document from Ethiopia entitled \u2018Request for Interpretation,\nCorrection and Consultation\u2019. This was sent to Eritrea for comments and these\n786 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\nboundary rivers would be deferred to the demarcation phase in the light of the wishes of both the\nparties. However, the Commission did note that: \u2018The boundary in rivers should be determined by\nreference to the location of the main channel; and this should be identified during the dry season\u2019\nin view of the parties\u2019 agreement, ibid paras 7.2\u20137.3. This was confirmed in the Comments to the\nCommission\u2019s Statement of 27 November 2006, ibid paras 26\u20137. The Commission also declared\nin a manner reflecting the approach of the Tribunal in the Eritrea\u2013Yemen (Territorial Sovereignty)\naward (n 1) para 526, that: \u2018Regard should be paid to the customary right of the local people to\nhave access to the river\u2019, ibid paras 7.2\u20137.3.\n165 The first was dated 29 May 2001, S\/2001\/608 Annex I and the 22nd covers the period up to\n20 December 2006, S\/2007\/33, Annex II.\n166 Commission Statement dated 27 November 2006, reproduced as an Enclosure to the\nSecretary-General\u2019s Special Report on Ethiopia and Eritrea to the Security Council dated 15\nDecember 2006, S\/2006\/992, p 9ff.\n167 S\/2002\/423.

Ethiopia raised a series of concerns. The\nCommission emphasized in its Decision, that the facility accorded to the\nparties in Article 28(1) of the Rules of Procedure to request the Commission\nto give an interpretation of the Decision could \u2018only be invoked where the\nmeaning of some specific statement in the Decision is unclear and requires\nclarification in order that the Decision should be properly applied\u2019.170 The\nCommission declared the request inadmissible, noting that no uncertainty in\nthe Decision could be identified that could be resolved by interpretation at the\npresent stage nor any case made out for revision.171\nThe Commission drafted and subsequently promulgated on 8 July 2002\nbinding Demarcation Directions, which included the statement that: \u2018The\nCommission has no authority to vary the boundary line. If it runs through and\ndivides a town or village, the line may be varied only on the basis of an express\nrequest agreed between and made by both Parties\u2019.172 These Directions were\namended in November 2002 and March and July 2003 and a set of\nDemarcation Instructions issued on 21 March 2003 and 22 August 2003.173 In\nthe Demarcation Directions, it was stated that the general purpose of the\ndemarcation was to set on the ground pillars identifying the course of the line\ndecided in the delimitation decision and to determine more precisely the\ndelimitation line at Tserona and Zalambessa and in the Eastern Sector. The\ndemarcation process was to be carried out by or under the responsibility of the\nCommission.174\nOn 17 July 2002, and following upon a request from Eritrea, the\nCommission issued an Order (pursuant to Articles 20 and 27(1) of the Rules\nof Procedure) holding that any Ethiopian government-sponsored resettlement\nof Ethiopian nationals in Dembe Mengul175 after 13 April should not have\ntaken place and requiring the return to Ethiopian territory of such persons and\nrequiring both parties to ensure that no further population resettlement across\nthe delimitation line established by its Decision should take place.176 The\nCommission confirmed its competence to make this Order and determined that\nits jurisdiction and powers \u2018extend to its taking cognisance of, and where\nThe Experience of the Eritrea\u2013Ethiopia Boundary Commission 787\n170 In particular, the Commission noted that: \u2018The concept of interpretation does not open up\nthe possibility of appeal against a decision or the reopening of matters clearly settled by a deci-\nsion\u2019, see Decision Regarding the \u2018Request for Interpretation, Correction and Consultation\u2019\nSubmitted by the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia on 13 May 2002, 24 June 2002, para\n16. The Commission emphasized that re-argument of the case was not permitted and this was\nconsistent with international judicial practice as to the limits of interpretation, citing the Chorzow\nFactory case, PCIJ, Series A, No 13, p 21; and the Arbitration on the Delimitation of the\nContinental Shelf (France\u2013UK), Interpretive Decision of 14 March 1978 54 International Law\nReports, 161.\n171 Decision of 24 June 2002, ibid paras 17\u201318.\n172 Para 14 A.\n173 See Sixteenth Report of the Commission, S\/2005\/142 Annex I, Enclosures 1 and 2.\n174 ibid.

The Commission emphasized that it had not been given\nthe power to vary the boundary delimited in the April Decision. It had not been\ngiven the power to decide ex aequo et bono nor had it been given the power to\nvary the boundary in the process of demarcation for the purpose of meeting\nlocal human needs. In the absence of such authority, the hands of the\nCommission are in large measure tied.178\nThe Commission issued \u2018Observations\u2019 on 21 March 2003,179 declaring\nthat there was no authority for it to add to or subtract from the terms of the\ncolonial treaties or to include within the applicable international law elements\nof flexibility which it does not already contain. In analysing the role of demar-\ncation, it was emphasized that there was no settled rule of customary interna-\ntional law to the effect that boundary demarcators not so expressly empowered\npossess the power of latitude or flexibility in the process of demarcation.180\nThe Commission also addressed the question of subsequent conduct, empha-\nsizing that in considering this in reaching its decision, it relied on the evidence\nplaced before it by the parties during the written and oral pleadings. However,\nit could not accept additional evidence of such conduct at the post-decision\nphase since this would mean that the Commission\u2019s decision was not \u2018final\u2019 as\nrequired in the December Agreement. It was concluded clearly that there was\n\u2018no further room for the introduction by the Parties of additional new evidence\n788 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n177 Eritrea\u2013Ethiopia Boundary Commission, Determinations, 7 Nov 2002, p 2. See also\nS\/2002\/1245 and the Seventh Report of the Commission, S\/2002\/1393 Annex I. On 14 August\nthat year, the Security Council adopted resolution 1430 calling on the parties to refrain from\nunilateral troop or population movements, including the establishment of any new settlement in\nareas near the border, until demarcation and orderly transfer of territorial control had been accom-\nplished in accordance with Art 4 (16) of the December Agreement.\n178 The Commission concluded that \u2018In the absence of agreement, however, the Commission\u2019s\nability to ameliorate\u2014on its own initiative\u2014any problems that might arise is limited to minor\nclarifications justified principally by the enlargement of the scale of the maps with which it is\nworking\u2019, S\/2003\/257 Annex I, para 4.\n179 This was done explicitly with the aim of \u2018avoiding certain misunderstandings regarding the\ncontent and effect of the Commission\u2019s Delimitation Decision . . . and regarding its tasks during\nthe demarcation process\u2019 and in the light of \u2018the unusual features of the present situation, in which\nthe Boundary Commission is required to continue its work by demarcating the boundary but with-\nout provision for formal pleadings by the Parties or full oral hearings\u2019, para 1.\n180 Para 7. The Commission stated that: \u2018a demarcator must demarcate the boundary as it has\nbeen laid down in the delimitation instrument, but with a limited margin of appreciation enabling\nit to take account of any flexibility in the terms of the delimitation itself or of the scale and accu-\nracy of maps used in the delimitation process, and to avoid establishing a boundary which is mani-\nfestly impracticable\u2019, para 8. The Commission accepted that in certain matters\u2014Tserona,\nZalambessa, Bure, the Eastern Sector as a whole, rivers, the recalculation of coordinates and the\nneed to produce a final and definitive map\u2014further work was required, ibid para 10.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Aug 2013 IP address: 143.210.121.140\nof their conduct, or for the Commission to seek out such evidence\u2019.181 The\nCommission drew particular attention to its conclusions in the Western Sector,\nadding that the maps submitted by Ethiopia were inconsistent as to the loca-\ntion of Badme village (claimed by Ethiopia but held to lie within Eritrea on the\nbasis of the straight-line boundary drawn by the Commission from Point 6 to\nPoint 9) and that such Ethiopian evidence as was provided concerning govern-\nmental activity was insufficient to convince the Commission to depart from\nthe line that had crystallized by 1935.182\nThe Commission noted, however, that in the light of \u2018further work done in\nthe exercise of its demarcation function\u2019, it had identified two areas in the\nCentral Sector where the line as delimited in its decision would be \u2018manifestly\nimpracticable\u2019, namely certain plateau lands in the vicinity of Point 18 and the\narea of the delta-like formation where the Ragali river flows into the Salt Lake.\nDemarcation instructions to the parties were to be issued at a later date.183 The\nCommission emphasized that: \u2018It is accepted as a matter of international law\nthat it is the dispositif which is operative and binding, and which prevails if\nthere is any discrepancy between it and the body of a tribunal\u2019s award\u2019.184\nThe process, however, became delayed as Ethiopia was prepared to give the\nnecessary security assurances for demarcation activities only with regard to\nthe Eastern Sector and Mareb river section of the boundary and, in particular,\ninformed the UN Secretary-General of its decision not to allow demarcation in\nBadme and Irob. In a letter dated 19 September 2003, the Prime Minister of\nEthiopia criticized the Commission\u2019s decision with regard to Badme and parts\nof the Central Sector as \u2018totally illegal, unjust and irresponsible\u2019.185 The\nPresident of the Commission responded in a letter of 7 October to the UN\nSecretary-General, in which the view taken by the Commission with regard to\nBadme was reaffirmed as flowing from the correct interpretation of the rele-\nvant treaty. In particular, it was noted that the Commission was convinced that\npertinent State practice consisting primarily of a series of maps, including\nthose published by Ethiopia, \u2018showed the parties\u2019 agreement upon an inter-\npretation of the relevant treaty, which placed the boundary prescribed by that\ntreaty in the location determined by the Commission\u2019.186 The \u2018paucity of\nevidence produced by the parties in relation specifically to Badme\u2019, referred\nThe Experience of the Eritrea\u2013Ethiopia Boundary Commission 789\n181 Para 13.\n182 Para 17.\n183 Para 20. In addition, it was felt that insufficient information concerning the precise location\nof Fort Cadorna had been provided (para 23), and that some clarification was required with regard\nto the area immediately to the south-east of Zalambessa in view of a discrepancy between the\nCommission\u2019s reasoning (para 4.42) on the one hand and the summary of the Treaty boundary\n(para 4.59 (6) and (7)) and the dispositif as shown on Map 11 on the other.\n184 Para 24. The Commission also stated that from the aerial photo survey that it was only\nrecently permitted to conduct, it appeared that map evidence submitted by both parties with regard\nto the placement of Point 20 was inaccurate. Appropriate instructions were to be issued to the\ndemarcation team, para 25.\n185 Eleventh Report of the Commission, S\/2003\/1186 Annex I, paras 4 and 10.\n186 ibid Appendix I, para 8.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Aug 2013 IP address: 143.210.121.140\nto in the Observations of 21 March 2003, was repeated.187 The President\u2019s\nletter also noted that:188\nWhere villages have sprung up or spread in recent times, and in so doing trans-\ngress boundaries previously established by older treaties, it is fully consistent\nwith international law for the treaty-based boundary to be maintained and for the\nresolution of any consequential human problems to be left for the parties to\nresolve by agreement . . . that result is precisely what the International Court of\nJustice decided, in comparable circumstances, in its recent judgment in the\nCameroon v Nigeria case.189\nEthiopia subsequently took the position that no work could be carried out in\nthe Western and Central Sectors until the Eastern Sector had been completely\ndemarcated and only if that State approved the Commission\u2019s method of\ndemarcation. Eritrea maintained that no demarcation could be carried out until\nit was absolutely clear that demarcation would take place in the other parts in\naccordance with the delimitation decision.190 The Commission concluded that\nEthiopia was expressing its dissatisfaction with the delimitation decision in the\nform of procedural impediments to the demarcation process.191\nOn 25 November 2004, the Ethiopian Prime Minister submitted a five-\npoint peace proposal, point 3 of which noted that \u2018Ethiopia accepts, in princi-\nple, the Ethiopia\u2013Eritrea Boundary Commission decision\u2019 and point 5 of\nwhich called for a dialogue to start immediately \u2018with the view to implement-\ning the Ethiopia\u2013Eritrea Boundary Commission\u2019s decision in a manner consis-\ntent with the promotion of sustainable peace and brotherly ties between the\ntwo peoples\u2019.192 However, attempts to restart the demarcation process failed\nand the two parties reiterated their positions referred to in the President\u2019s letter\nof 7 October 2003.193\n790 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n187 ibid Appendix I, para 9.\n188 ibid, para 10. Further, Art 4 (16) of the December Agreement specifically stated that \u2018the\nparties request the United Nations to facilitate resolution of problems which may arise due to the\ntransfer of territorial control, including the consequences for individuals residing in previously\ndisputed territory\u2019.\n189 In fact in the Cameroon case, decided some six months after the Eritrea\u2013Ethiopia decision,\nthe Court stated clearly that: \u2018it has no power to modify a delimited boundary line, even in a case\nwhere a village previously situated on one side of the boundary has spread beyond it. It is instead\nup to the parties to find a solution to any resultant problems, with a view to respecting the rights\nand interests of the local population\u2019, Cameroon v Nigeria (n 1) para 123.

Conduct incon-\nsistent with the boundary line was stated to be \u2018unlawful\u2019, ibid para 33. What remained to be done\nwas the physical demarcation of the line \u2018on the ground by the placing of visible markers at appro-\npriate locations\u2019, ibid para 15 and see above.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Aug 2013 IP address: 143.210.121.140\nFaced with continuing non-cooperation by the parties, the Commission\ndecided at its meeting on 20 November 2006194 to complete the work of\ndemarcation by itself. Declaring that the interpretation of the December\nAgreement which had established the Commission as an international institu-\ntion had to be approached in the same way that international institutions\nconstrued their constitutional instruments, that is by way of the concept of\ninstitutional \u2018effectiveness\u2019, the Commission concluded that it was able \u2018to\ninterpret its procedures in a constructive manner directed towards achieving\nthe objective the Parties are deemed to have had in mind\u2019.195 The objective\nwas declared to be the conclusion of the border dispute at the earliest possible\ndate.196 Although the first-choice method of demarcation remained the actual\nfixing of boundary pillars on the ground, this was only possible with the full\ncooperation of both the States concerned. Accordingly, the Commission\ndecided that the most practical way of advancing its mandate was to provide\nthe parties with a list of boundary points identified by the Commission by\nmeans of modern techniques of image processing and terrain modelling in\nconjunction with aerial photography. This list of boundary points would repre-\nsent the locations at which, if the Commission were so enabled by the parties,\nit would construct permanent pillars. This list, accompanied by 45 maps illus-\ntrating the boundary points, was attached to the Commission Statement.197\nThe Commission proposed that the parties consider their positions and seek\nto reach agreement on the placement of pillars over a twelve-month period,\nterminating at the end of November 2007. If by that date the parties have not\nreached the necessary agreement and proceeded significantly to implement it,\nor have not requested and enabled the Commission to resume its activity, the\nCommission declared that the boundary will automatically stand as demar-\ncated by the points listed and the mandate of the Commission fulfilled. Until\nsuch time as the boundary is finally demarcated, the Delimitation Decision of\n13 April 2002 will continue \u2018as the only valid legal description of the bound-\nary\u2019.198 In so acting, the Commission referred to the practice of the\nIraq\u2013Kuwait Boundary Demarcation Commission in establishing coordinates\nand of maritime delimitations.199\nThe Experience of the Eritrea\u2013Ethiopia Boundary Commission 791\n194 Attended by the witnesses to the Algiers Agreement (UN Secretary-General, the EU, USA\nand Algeria).

This position was reaffirmed by the Commission in its Press Release of 12\nSeptember 2007. The Commission also concluded that no further progress could be made towards\nthe emplacement of pillars at this stage. On 25 September 2007 the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry\nissued a press statement saying that Eritrea was in material breach of the Algiers Agreements and\nthat Ethiopia was entitled to consider its legal and peaceful options including terminating the\nAgreements or suspending their operation in whole or in part. While this cannot affect the valid-\nity of the boundary decision of the Commission, Ethiopia\u2019s possible action would clearly affect\nthe peaceful settlement of the disputes as a whole.\n199 ibid paras 23\u20136.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Aug 2013 IP address: 143.210.121.140\nIV. THE INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT\nAs noted at the start of this article, the Commission was established by the\nDecember Agreement, which followed the Framework Agreement and the\nModalities for its Implementation of July 1999 and the Agreement on Cessation\nof Hostilities of June 2000, both of which were endorsed by the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (as it then was) and the United Nations.200 In addition, the\nDecember Agreement was witnessed by Algeria, the UN, the OAU\/AU, the\nEuropean Union and the US. This constitutes an important factor with regard to\nimplementation of increasing importance. The UN Security Council has offered\nits encouragement for the whole process since it reaffirmed its \u2018strong support\u2019\nfor the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities and for the December\nAgreement as well as expressing its satisfaction that \u2018a final legal settlement of\nthe border issues\u2019 was about to be reached in accordance with the agreements of\n2000 and emphasizing \u2018the importance of ensuring expeditious implementation\nof the upcoming decision by the Boundary Commission\u2019 as well as \u2018its resolve\nto support the parties in the implementation of the decision by the Boundary\nCommission\u2019.201 Upon the rendering of the Commission\u2019s decision, the Security\nCouncil issued a presidential statement on 16 April 2002 welcoming that deci-\nsion and commending the \u2018commitment of Ethiopia and Eritrea to accept the\ndecision of the Commission as final and binding\u2019.202\nIn Resolution 1430, adopted on 14 August 2002, the Council decided to\nadjust the mandate of the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea\n(UNMEE) \u2018in order to assist the Boundary Commission in the expeditious and\norderly implementation of the Delimitation Decision\u2019 and called upon the\nparties \u2018to cooperate fully and promptly with the Boundary Commission, includ-\ning by implementing without conditions its binding Demarcation Directions\u2019.\nThe commitment of the Council to the 2000 agreements and the delimitation\ndecision \u2018embraced by the parties as final and binding\u2019 in accordance with these\nagreements was reaffirmed in Resolutions 1434 (2002) and 1507 (2003). The\nlatter called specifically upon Ethiopia and Eritrea to cooperate with the\nCommission to enable it to fulfil its mandate to demarcate expeditiously the\nboundary.\nThe Security Council expressed its concern about \u2018Ethiopia\u2019s ongoing\nrejection of significant parts of the Boundary Commission\u2019s decision, and its\ncurrent lack of cooperation with the Boundary Commission\u2019 in Resolution\n1560 (2004). The Council also stressed that Ethiopia and Eritrea had the\n792 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n200 See the preamble to the December Agreement.\n201 Resolution 1398, paras 2, 5, and 9, adopted on 15 March 2002.

CONCLUSION\nThe following general comments may be made in conclusion:\nThe Experience of the Eritrea\u2013Ethiopia Boundary Commission 793\n203 See also Resolution 1586 (2005). Eritrea was called upon to cooperate with the UN\nSecretary General\u2019s Special Envoy for Ethiopia and Eritrea. Eritrea also banned the overflight of\nUNMEE helicopters and restricted the movement of UNMEE patrols. A presidential statement of\nthe Council on 3 March 2006 called for these restrictions to be lifted.\n204 See also Security Council Resolution 1661 (2006) which demanded that the parties comply\nfully with Resolution 1640 (2005) and extended for one month the mandate of UNMEE.\n205 Twentieth Report of the Commission, S\/2006\/140 Annex II, para 2.\n206 ibid para 3 and S\/PRST\/2006\/10.

As to the process itself, one is struck by the speed with which the\nCommission was obliged to produce its delimitation decision, particularly as\nthe violent and wide-ranging conflict had only recently been concluded. The\nhostile environment re-emerged after the Commission\u2019s delimitation decision\nas Ethiopia sought first to reject and then to modify it, while Eritrea pressur-\nized UNMEE and then placed its own forces within the Temporary Security\nZone in an effort to ensure the decision was carried out. Perhaps the provision\nof a longer period within which the Commission and the parties could work\nwith regard to the delimitation issue might have enabled the latter to argue the\ncase in a way that may have precluded later expressions of surprise at the\noutcome and to have appreciated the strong points in each other\u2019s cases. It\nmight also have enabled the UN to seek politically to mitigate the tensions in\nthe area with rather more success.\n2. One critical issue raised is whether delimitation and demarcation should be\nplaced in the hands of the same judicial or arbitral body. The advantages of\ndoing this include the knowledge and expertise developed by the particular\ntribunal (where appropriately technically assisted), the fact that this should\nspeed up the process of boundary settlement and the capacity and competence\nof the tribunal in dealing with matters as they arise during the often-complex\nprocess from establishment of the legal boundary to the final placement of\nboundary markers on the ground. The disadvantage is that it may encourage\nongoing efforts by the unsuccessful party to use the demarcation process in an\neffort to pressure the tribunal in question to modify its boundary delimitation\ndecision. The experience of the Eritrea\u2013Ethiopia Boundary Commission\ndemonstrates precisely this. The danger is that a lesser tribunal may be\ntempted to give way to heavy pressure by one side to such an extent that the\nprocess of delimitation itself may be undermined and its finality constantly\nchallenged. In this sense, the danger implicit in a procedure necessitating\ncontinuing interventions by the delimitation tribunal is that material may be\nproduced which could be interpreted by one party or another as in some way\ninconsistent with the terms of the delimitation award.\nApart from the fact that the parties themselves may agree to boundary\nchanges, attempts to convince the tribunal itself to do this would blur the crit-\nical distinction between delimitation and demarcation and likely result in the\nelongation of the delimitation process in practice since the latter phase would\nbe seen as simply a sort of appeal or revision mechanism. This would\ninevitably maximize the dangers in what is always a sensitive situation of a\nradical deterioration in the relations between the parties. The best way\nforward, it appears, is to ensure that the two stages of delimitation and demar-\ncation are kept firmly separate and allocated to two separate bodies.\n3. It seems clear that the December Agreement was focused upon resolving the\nviolent conflict which had only recently ceased. It recognized the importance\n794 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Aug 2013 IP address: 143.210.121.140\nof establishing a clear boundary recognized by the parties and by the interna-\ntional community, but perhaps devoted less attention to the process of demar-\ncation than it might have done. In particular, it might have proved of some\nbenefit to have given the Commission the power to modify the delimitation\nline where specific local conditions could be seen to require this, an approach\nwhich is not unusual in the demarcation process and which may prove helpful\nprovided that it is accepted that the delimitation decision reached on the basis\nof law is final and not subject to change, other than by the parties acting\ntogether. There is a profound difference between a delimitation made on the\nbasis of the applicable law and a demarcation reached by applying the delim-\nitation line in accord with any relevant local geographical factors. However,\nalthough the Commission emphasized that it could not modify the delimitation\nline, it was accepted that \u2018a limited margin of appreciation\u2019 did exist where\nthere was any flexibility in the terms of the delimitation itself or of the scale\nand accuracy of maps used in the delimitation process and with regard to the\navoidance of establishing a boundary which is manifestly impracticable. This\nnarrow margin could have been widened by the terms of the December\nAgreement, but without such authority it could not be assumed.\n4. With regard to its continuing competence, the Commission determined that its\njurisdiction and powers extended to making decisions on \u2018any matter it finds\nnecessary for the performance of its mandate to delimit and demarcate the\nboundary\u2019.208 This was stated with regard to Ethiopia\u2019s attempted settlement of\nits nationals on Eritrea\u2019s side of the delimitation line, but it marks an important\nprinciple with regard to any tribunal with an ongoing mandate. So long as this\ndoes not result in a change in the delimitation award, this is acceptable and in\nthis case certainly helped to maintain the integrity of the decision itself.\n5. The careful evaluation of the relationship between title and conduct in the\nCommission\u2019s approach is particularly instructive. Despite criticisms to the\ncontrary,209 the Commission was meticulous in distinguishing the hierarchy\nand operative roles of treaty title and the conduct of the parties. The Burkina\nFaso\/Mali paradigm has not been overturned but rather elucidated. A treaty\ntitle is the delimitation line unless the contrary is proved and the standard of\nproof has to be high. A clear title by treaty provision may only be modified by\nthe subsequent practice of the parties where this is unmistakably intended and\nis a question of evidence. The Commission emphasized that this could only\nhappen where the effect of the subsequent conduct is \u2018so clear\u2019 that a treaty\nprovision may be varied.210 Even here, the Commission made the point that\nconduct could only provide or suggest a title relative to the competing State so\nThe Experience of the Eritrea\u2013Ethiopia Boundary Commission 795\n208 Eritrea\u2013Ethiopia Boundary Commission, Determinations (7 Nov 2002) 2.\n209 See, eg, Kohen, who argues that the Commission virtually placed title and State conduct on\nthe same level (n 109) 595.\n210 Award, para 3.8.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 20 Aug 2013 IP address: 143.210.121.140\nthat the conduct of one party must be measured against that of the other.211\nWhere the parties had expressly or by their mutual conduct clearly accepted a\nvariation of a treaty title in a particular area, this would mark the common will\nof the parties in question and would be accepted.212 Thus, although a title by\ntreaty constitutes the core of any delimitation, it may not necessarily constitute\nthe end-point of any delimitation. Of course, where the treaty provision in ques-\ntion is ambiguous, then the degree of effective control or conduct required to\nbe demonstrated in order to secure title would be correspondingly less than in\nthe case of conduct modifying a clear delimitation provision and would itself\nbe relative to the particular circumstances including the claims of the parties.\n6. The establishment of the unilateral demarcation line by the Commission in\nits Statement of 27 November 2006, albeit subject to the views of the parties\nuntil November 2007, is unusual. It has the advantage of seeking to encourage\nthe parties to cooperate in order to resolve the matter, but the disadvantage of\nproducing a decision which may be ignored. Nevertheless, the precedential\nvalue of such an approach may be of value in seeking to ensure that in future\ndisputes the parties proceed normally through the demarcation process, aware\nthat as a last resort the demarcation authority may be prepared to determine the\nline itself.\n7. The close and institutionalized involvement in the settlement of volatile\nboundary disputes by significant international players, particularly the United\nNations, which was asked in the December Agreement to \u2018facilitate resolu-\ntions of problems which may arise due to the transfer of territorial control\u2019,213\nis likely to prove an important precedent. Although to date such involvement\nin the Eritrea\u2013Ethiopia dispute has demonstrated impotence rather than\nsuccess, in the longer term that may not necessarily remain so and the resolu-\ntion of many boundary disputes could be given additional legitimacy and\nweight by such international underpinning, as well as ensuring a level of\nresource allocation to enable the boundary delimitation and demarcation\nprocesses to be completed and ensured. However, it is important to realize that\nany such international involvement implies responsibility for implementation.\nAlthough at the time of writing, it cannot be said that the mission of the\nEritrea\u2013Ethiopia Boundary Commission has been completed as envisaged, it\nis certainly conceivable that political circumstances may change so as to\nenable the final and successful completion of the Commission\u2019s mandate. At\nthat point, no doubt the value of the Commission\u2019s work taken overall may be\nappreciated. In the meantime, there are lessons to be learned.\n796 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\n211 ibid para 3.29.\n212 See above, p 784.\n213 See above, p 758.\n"}
