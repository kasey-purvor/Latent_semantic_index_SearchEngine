Expressed proteins of course\ndo not disperse in perfectly miscible souplike fashion, but\nwe can reasonably suppose that they must remain essen-\ntially miscible in respect of their macroscopic phase be-\nhavior. It is known for molecular mixtures in general that\nmiscibility is sensitive to low moments of the size distri-\nbution [4], so we might anticipate that microbial intra-\ncellular stability depends analogously on moments of the\nproteomic expression level profile with respect to sequence\nlength. Our principal objective here is to demonstrate this\nmore explicitly within a model framework.\nConsider a crude molecular statistical formulation of the\nHelmholtz free energy F \u0001 U\u0002 TS describing the ex-\npressed protein ensemble, where U and S denote, respec-\ntively, internal energy and entropy at temperature T. We\nassume a continuous distribution \u0005\u0003l\u0004 over length l in\namino acid residues. With \u0007 the total protein number\ndensity, \u0007\u0005\u0003l\u0004dl is the concentration in the cytosol having\nlength between l and l\u0005 dl. Assuming proteins with the\nsame l can be considered indistinguishable with respect to\ntheir mutual interactions, we can then write for the entropy\ndensity over volume V of the cytosol\nS=V \u0001 \u0002 kB\u0007\nZ\n\u0005\u0003l\u0004fln\u0007\u0007\u0005\u0003l\u0004\b \u0002 1gdl (1)\nwhere kB is Boltzmann\u2019s constant.05=94(17)=178105(4)$23.00 17810Next we assume that the dominant contribution to the\ninternal energy U comes from nonspecific adhesive inter-\naction between proteins. For a system of monodisperse\nadhesive well particles U=V \u2019 \u0002 2\r\u000e\u00072ad2, where d is\nthe particle diameter, a is the well width, and \u000e is its depth.\nIn this spirit, we write\nU=V \u0001 \u00022\r\u000e\u00072a3hl2=3i; (2)\nwhere h. . .i denotes the distribution-averaged moment.\nHere we have identified a with the amino acid length scale,\nand set d \u0001 al1=3 to represent a compact protein compris-\ning l residues.\nTo look for a miscibility gap in the parameter space of\nthis description, we construct the matrix of second partial\nderivatives of F with respect to dimensionless moment\ndensities \u00110 \u0001 \u0007a3 and \u00111 \u0001 \u0007a3hl2=3i. A spinodal locus\nof demixing will occur when the lowest eigenvalue of this\nmatrix goes to zero, the corresponding eigenvector giving\nthe unstable spinodal fluctuation mode which begins to\ngrow unchecked as the locus is crossed.\nAdopting the Legendre transform method outlined in [5]\nto treat the entropic part, we obtain\n\u00110@\n2 ~F=@\u001120 \u0001 hl4=3i\u0007hl4=3i \u0002 hl2=3i2\b\u00021;\n\u00110@2 ~F=@\u001121 \u0001 \u0007hl4=3i \u0002 hl2=3i2\b\u00021;\n\u00110@\n2 ~F=@\u00110\u00111 \u0001 \u0002hl2=3i\u0007hl4=3i \u0002 hl2=3i2\b\u00021\n\u0002 2\r\u000e\u0007a3=kT;\n(3)\nwhere ~F \u0001 a3F=\u0003VkT\u0004 is a convenient dimensionless scal-\ning of the free energy. Hence from the zero determinant\ncondition @2 ~F=@\u001120@2 ~F=@\u001121 \u0001 \u0003@2 ~F=@\u00110@\u00111\u00042, we have\nfor the spinodal\n\u0003\r\u000e\u0007a3=kT\u0004hl2=3i\u0005\u0003\r\u000e\u0007a3=kT\u00042\u0007hl4=3i\u0002hl2=3i2\b\u00011=4:\n(4)\nSince the total protein volume fraction \u0014 \u2019 15% is a\nfairly universal feature of a microbial cytosol, it is useful to\nrecast this expression making use of the approximate rela-5-1 \uf6d9 2005 The American Physical Society\nPRL 94, 178105 (2005) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending6 MAY 2005\ntion \u0014 \u2019 \u0007a3hli,\n\u0003\r\u0014\u000e=kT\u0004hlihl2=3i\u0005\u0003\r\u0014\u000e=kT\u00042\u0007hl4=3i\u0002hl2=3i2\b\u0001 hli2=4:\n(5)\nIn Fig. 1 we have plotted this constant volume fraction\nresult over the moment space of a log-normal distribution.\nA miscibility gap is reached with decreasing hli, depending\nonly very weakly on the reduced standard deviation \u0015 \u0001\n\u0016=hli, and tending to increase in size with increasing\nadhesive strength \u000e=kT. The calculation sets a physically\nplausible \u000e \u0001 3:5kT, roughly reflecting literature estimates\nof the free energy gain of burying a surface-exposed hydro-\nphobic residue in a protein-protein contact [6].\nThe predicted low sensitivity to polydispersity is note-\nworthy. It indicates that, in respect to phase separation, the\ncytosol is well represented by a hypothetical monodisperse\ndistribution comprising proteins of a single length, a mini-\nmum length being required for stability [7]. The miscibility\ngap can be regarded simultaneously as a precipitous gap in\nthe fitness landscape governing microbial phenotype.\nHence the miscibility criterion on length generates an\nevolutionary pressure in favor of larger proteins. It is\ninteresting to note that, in as much as (via more general\ntreatment of the protein-protein interaction parameter \u000e)\nthe miscibility gap will tend to shift with temperature,\nsalinity, and pH, this nature of associated evolutionary\npressure is coupled to the environment.\nIn living microbial organisms, proteins are constantly\nsynthesized, degraded, resynthesized.

For experimental comparison, the points present samples\nof the protein expression profile of Vibrio salmonicida under four\ndifferent growth conditions. The samples monitor the relative\nabundance of 24 protein species randomly chosen from a 2D gel\nelectrophoretic map [8]. During the lifespan of an organism,\npoints such as these would typically fall along some complex\ndynamical trajectory (arrows, figurative only) of environmental\nresponse and stochastic fluctuation.\n17810erates a temporal dynamics over the moment space of\nour model, which can be explored experimentally by\nproteomic techniques such as 2D gel electrophoresis. By\nway of illustration, we have included in Fig. 1 some\nresults from proteomic analysis of the bacterium\nVibrio salmonicida responding to different growth condi-\ntions [8]. Although clearly there is scope for further and\nmore systematic investigation along such lines, these re-\nsults are broadly consistent with the scenario we are sug-\ngesting, in so far as turnover remains confined to the\npredicted miscible domain.\nFrom a genome-evolutionary point of view, an intriguing\npossibility is that the fairly localized nature of the turnover\nin moment space which is in evidence here might loosely\ncorrelate with the corresponding distribution of open read-\ning frames (ORFs) along the genome. That is, the number\nof proteins of a given length expressed in the cytosol at any\ngiven time is weakly proportional to the number of proteins\nof that length in the organism\u2019s genome. For example, the\nmean position of the points in Fig. 1 is hli \u0001 362, \u0015 \u0001\n0:43, as compared with hli \u0001 316, \u0015 \u0001 0:68 for the V.\nsalmonicida ORF length distribution. This idea is pursued\nin Fig. 2 where we have plotted the moment space coor-\ndinates of several of the microbial genomes available from\npublic databases.

Thus it appears\nfeasible that, beyond directly constraining protein expres-\nsion, miscibility might also contribute to shaping the ge-\nnomic ORF length distribution.\nUp to this point, we have considered the gap to be\nstrictly unviable in respect of biological function, hence\nevolutionarily deleterious. Inside the gap, the energy\/en-\ntropy balance of the cytosol is upset to the extent that it is\nno longer possible to express its proteome without a sig-\nnificant fraction spontaneously condensing out into new\nthermodynamically distinct compartments, which ordina-\nrily we expect to impede function. The presumably rather\nsmall probability that a viable compartmentalization can\noccur inside the gap nevertheless merits consideration, in\nso far as it might have some bearing on the evolutionary\ntransition from prokaryote to eukaryote (Fig. 3). In par-\nticular, there is currently no clear consensus on the origin\nof the eukaryote nucleus. A symbiotic merger between\nprokaryote strains is a strong contender, but a number ofFIG. 3. Thermodynamic route to intracellular compartmental-\nization. If a prokaryote enters the gap, local compositional\nfluctuations become unstable in the cytosol, growing and con-\ndensing into at least one thermodynamically distinct nascent\ncompartment. The unstable mode of fluctuation along the edge\nof the gap is shown bottom right. This points towards a nascent\ncompartment in which the molecular weight distribution has\nlower hli and slightly higher variance than the original cytosol\n(also lower density \u0007, not shown). In the majority of instances, a\ncompartment formed in this way is unlikely to be functionally\nviable, nor does it necessarily envelope the prokaryote nucleoid\n(hexagon).\n17810alternative possible origins appear similarly plausible, no-\ntably the involvement of viruses [9]. Although supported\nto varying extents by sequence comparative analysis, it is\nless clear how these competing hypotheses deal with ex-\nisting examples of prokaryote strains in which the DNA-\ncomprising nucleoid sits within a distinct membrane-\nbound intracellular compartment: in effect a crude nuclear\nbody, but lacking further attributes of the modern eukary-\note nucleus (nuclear pores, nucleosomes, etc.) [10]. If these\nstrains reflect a first evolutionary step in nuclear develop-\nment taken by ancestral proto-eukaryotes, then a thermo-\ndynamic explanation along the present lines seems a\nplausible alternative to the existing proposals.\nIn addition to a mutational mode driving the transition\n(i.e., changes in the expressed protein length distribution),\nour approach suggests a relatively straightforward selec-\ntive rationale. By putting different proteins into different\ncompartments, an organism can eliminate or at least alle-\nviate the miscibility constraint. It thereby achieves greater\nfreedom to evolve, asserting biochemical fitness advan-\ntages which would otherwise be inaccessible to a simple\nprokaryote.\nAlternatively in our approach, compartmentalization\ncan also be induced by changes in the environmental\nengines of microbial diversity\u2014temperature, salinity,\nand pH. As the stability threshold responds to environ-\nmental fluctuations, it is conceivable that microbial strains,\nfinding themselves deep inside the miscibility gap, are\nforced to test the functional viability of spontaneously\nformed compartments on a fairly regular basis.\nOverall, the statistical mechanical model and interpre-\ntation of data we have presented here ignore numerous\ncaveats. For example, besides the obvious limitations of\nthe ORF-cytosol correlation ansatz, we have not filtered off\nfrom the dataset putative membrane ORFs which are not\nexpressed in the cytosol. A real world cytosol is never\nsensu stricto in the ergodic statistical mechanical equi-\nlibrium which is tacitly assumed in the miscibility analy-\nsis. Moreover, we have neglected all specific details of\nprotein-protein interaction and molecular recognition.\nNevertheless, despite this crudeness of approximation on\nvarious fronts, it seems clear that the general phenomenol-\nogy of intracellular miscibility is capable of strongly in-\nfluencing microbial proteomics and evolution.5-3[1] R.
