The multilevel analyses that are usually conducted focus on differences in achievement \nbetween schools. Adjusting for the bias that results from intake differences seems essential. By \nfar the most frequently applied method includes prior achievement (usually together with other \nbackground characteristics) as a covariate in the data analysis. In this paper we point to an \nalternative method that does not need controls for prior achievement, namely the regression-\ndiscontinuity approach. Our data analysis will indicate to what extent this method produces \ndifferent outcomes when a cross-sectional as opposed to a longitudinal dataset is analyzed.  \n \nThe regression-discontinuity approach is a useful method for assessing the absolute effect of \nschooling with cross-sectional data. Studies based on this approach indicate that more than 50% \nof the progress pupils make over a one-year period is accounted for by schooling. (Cahan & \nDavis, 1987; Luyten, 2006). This perspective differs considerably from the results presented in \nthe bulk of the school effectiveness studies, which typically report that schools account for \napproximately ten percent of the variance in test scores after controlling for prior attainment \n(Scheerens & Bosker, 1997). The figure of 50% refers to the impact of receiving education in \nthe upper grade as opposed to the lower grade and is calculated as a percentage change in test \nscore, whereas the figure of 10% refers to the variation in the impact of schools\n1\n. The 50% \nfigure is more in line with educational effectiveness studies that address the variation between \nboth schools and classes\/teachers (e.g. Hill & Rowe, 1996; Opdenakker & Van Damme, 2000). \n \nRegression-discontinuity capitalizes on the fact that students are assigned to a higher or lower \ngrade on the basis of their date of birth. In most countries pupils born before a certain cut-off \npoint (in England, 1\nst\n September) generally end up in a higher grade than pupils that are just a \nfew days younger. The effect of one year extra schooling can thus be assessed by comparing the \nachievement scores of the pupils born shortly before the cut-off point to the scores of the ones \n                                                 \n1\n Note that these percentages are not really comparable with one another. Both figures express different aspects of \nthe same phenomenon. It seems possible to convert both percentages to effect sizes that have been defined in \nrelation to interventions in which there is a control and an experimental group (see Tymms, 2004). We will briefly \nreturn to this matter in the final section, but a detailed coverage of this topic is beyond the scope of this article. \n 3 \nborn shortly after the cut-off point. The latter ones are in the lower grade, whereas the former \nare in the upper grade and have received an extra year of schooling. Within each grade the \nrelationship between age and achievement is estimated. If the data analysis reveals a \ndiscontinuity between the oldest pupils in the lower grade and the youngest ones in the upper \ngrade, this is interpreted as the effect of one year extra schooling (i.e., being in the upper grade). \nAs the analysis takes into account the impact of the criterion used for assigning students to \neither grade, alternative interpretations are largely ruled out. It is conceivable that the cut-off \npoint coincides with other relevant factors, but \u2013 generally speaking \u2013 this is unlikely. The main \nstrength of the regression-discontinuity approach is that it predicts an effect at a very specific \npoint on the age continuum. When this approach is applied within a multilevel framework, the \neffect of schooling can be modelled as a random effect at the school level. Thus differences in \neffectiveness between schools can also be estimated.  \n \nNote, however, that correct modelling of the relation between age and achievement is crucial. If \na linear function is estimated, while in reality the function is quadratic or cubic the model will \nbe misspecified, and the regression-discontinuity may be biased. Another essential requirement \nis adherence to the cut-off point. In many countries, assignment to a particular grade does not \nadhere fully to a nation-wide cut-off point. In some cases, this may be (partly) due to regional \nvariations (for example, Australia and the United States), but grade retention is usually the main \ncause. If the degree of \u201cmisclassification\u201d is not excessive, it is still possible to obtain reliable \neffect estimates. If the percentage of misclassified participants is limited (preferably below five \npercent), it is best to exclude them (Judd & Kennedy, 1981; Trochim, 1984; Shadish et al., \n2002). In the dataset analyzed for the present study less than 1.5% of the pupils were in the \n\u201cwrong\u201d grade given their date of birth.  \n \nOne specific advantage of the regression-discontinuity approach is that \u2013 in principle \u2013 it does \nnot require controlling for prior achievement (or any other background characteristics) in order \nto assess the effect of schooling. As in randomised experiments, cross-sectional data is \nsufficient for strong causal inferences. The basic assumption is that the selection criterion \nconstitutes the only relevant difference between control and treatment group. With regard to \npupils from two (or more) consecutive grades this means that the distinct groups are assumed to \nbe equivalent in all relevant respects (e.g. gender distribution, socioeconomic background, \ncognitive aptitudes) besides age. This implies that estimating the grade effect by means of \nlongitudinal data should yield results that hardly differ from an analysis of cross-sectional data. \n 4 \nThis assertion will be put to the test in the present study. The effect of schooling will be \nestimated using both longitudinal and cross-sectional data. The data relate to four and five year \nold pupils in English reception classes. The reception class appears to be unique to England. In \nother countries it is more likely to be identified as a kindergarten group but in England it is \nclearly part of the school and typically follows pre-school provision (nursery or play group).  \n \nModelling the absolute effect of schooling \nEquation (1) presents the basic regression-discontinuity model. The coefficients \u03b21 and \u03b22 \nexpress the effect of age and the effect of one extra year schooling. It applies to a dataset with \nstudents from two consecutive grades. The effect of age is assumed linear and identical in both \ngrades (i.e., no interaction between age and grade).  \n \nYi = \u03b20 + \u03b21(xi \u2013 x0) + \u03b22zi + Ri  (1) \n \nWhere: \n  \nYi  = outcome measure (e.g., mathematics achievement score for student i) \nxi  = age, pupil i (see table 2 for details on the coding of the age variable)  \nx0  = cut-off value (in this study: 5 years) \nzi  = grade, student i (0 if lower grade; 1 if upper grade) \n\u03b20 = parameter for comparison group intercept at cut-off  \n\u03b21 = age effect   \n\u03b22 = effect of being in the upper grade (i.e., having received an extra year of schooling)         \nRi = random residual    \n \nWhen combining the regression-discontinuity approach with multilevel analysis, the intercept \n(\u03b20) and the effect of one extra year of schooling (\u03b22) are allowed to vary across schools:  \n \nYij = \u03b20j + \u03b21(xij \u2013 x0) + \u03b22jzij + Rij  (2) \n \nj  = index for schools \ni  = index for students within schools \n 5 \nThe intercept and the effect of schooling are now school-dependent. These school-dependent \ncoefficients can be separated into an average coefficient and the school-dependent deviation: \n \n\u03b20j = \u03b300 + U0j \n\u03b22j = \u03b320 + U2j \n \nSubstitution leads to the following model: \n \nYij = \u03b300 + \u03b21(xij \u2013 x0) + \u03b320zij + U0j + U2jzij + Rij  (3) \n \nIn this equation, \u03b320 expresses the general effect of one year extra schooling, while U2j \nrepresents the school-dependent deviation. Its variance is of particular interest, as it expresses \nthe extent to which the effect of schooling differs between schools. When fitting this model, the \nvariances of Rij and U0j are estimated, as is the covariance between U0j and U2j. This basic \nmodel can be extended in several ways. It can be applied to a wider range of adjacent grades \n(see the contribution by Kyriakides & Luyten to this special issue for an example) and the effect \nof age may be allowed to vary between grades. Such an interaction between the selection \nvariable (age) and the independent variable of interest (grade), however, may simply reflect a \ncurvilinear relation (Shadish et al., 2002; Trochim, 1984). In the findings section we will report \nthe estimated effects of grade when the age-achievement relation is modelled as a quadratic \nfunction\n2\n. It is also possible to test whether the effect of schooling is dependent on other \nvariables (e.g., SES). This could be modelled through interaction effects between the additional \nvariable(s) and the grade effect. A significant interaction effect would imply that the effect of \nschooling varies for pupils with different socioeconomic backgrounds. This question will not be \naddressed in the present contribution. The contribution by Verachtert et al. to this issue pays \nexplicit attention to differences in learning rates between pupils from different backgrounds. \nAnother possible extension would be to model a random effect of age at the school level. Fitting \ncomplex models with multiple random effects, however, requires a (very) large dataset. The \ndataset analyzed for this study includes data from only 18 schools. As a result only relatively \nsimple models could be fitted. \n \n                                                 \n2\n The estimated effects of grade in the models with quadratic effects of age included (see table 3) indeed hardly \ndiffer from the effects of grade in models that include an interaction effect of age with grade. Details on these \nanalyses can be obtained from the first author.  \n 6 \nStraightforward application of the regression-discontinuity approach relates to cross-sectional \ndata. The achievement scores of pupils in the upper grade are then compared to the scores of \nother pupils, which are in the lower grade. In the present study, however, the approach is also \napplied to longitudinal data. In that case the achievement scores of the pupils in the upper grade \nare compared to the scores attained one year earlier by the same pupils. In both cases we take \nthe effect of age on achievement into account. The net effect of being in the upper grade is the \ndifference in achievement between the lower and the upper grade adjusted for the effect of age. \nIn the case of longitudinal data the regression discontinuity analysis uses matched pupils \nwhereas the cross-sectional approach uses different pupils. Analysis of the longitudinal data \nyields additional information that cannot be obtained with cross-sectional data, namely the \nvariance of the grade effect at the individual level. It seems plausible that the effect of having \nreceived an extra year of schooling varies not only across schools, but also between pupils \nwithin schools. Estimation of this variance, however, requires longitudinal data. \n \nResearch questions \nThe primary aim of this study is to compare research outcomes based on cross-sectional data \nwith outcomes that are based on longitudinal data. More specifically this is applied to the \nfollowing research questions: \n \n1. What is the effect of one extra year of schooling on the level achievement? \n2. What proportion of the difference in achievement between two grades is accounted for by \nschooling? \n3. To what extent does the effect of one extra year of schooling vary between schools? \n \nThe data analyses relate to three subject areas, namely mathematics, reading and phonics. Some \nmore details regarding the outcome measures are provided in the variables section. \n \nData \nThe data come from the Performance Indicators in Primary School (PIPS) project (Tymms, \n1999a; Tymms & Albone, 2002) which is run from the Curriculum Evaluation and Management \n(CEM) Centre (Tymms & Coe, 2003) in Durham University, England. The project is designed \nto monitor the progress of pupils in school for schools. The data are not intended for outsiders \nand the schools, or their authorities, pay to join the project or part of it. The PIPS project starts \nwith an on-entry baseline assessment within six weeks of the pupils\u201f start at school. It is \n 7 \nrepeated at the end of the academic year in an extended form. The assessment can be \nadministered using a paper based or a computerised form and is always administered in a one-\nto-one situation taking about twenty minutes per pupil.  \n \nOur analyses relate to a (very) small part of the entire PIPS dataset, namely to the schools where \nthe pupils were first assessed using the on-entry baseline and re-assessed in September of the \nfollowing year. In most schools the pupils are assessed at the start and the end of the school year \n(September and June respectively). Only 18 schools are thus included in the analyses. The \nanalyses focus exclusively on pupils with standard school careers. Those with delayed or \naccelerated careers (1.5%) were excluded from the analyses.  \n \nThe analyses focus on two datasets, namely a cross-sectional and a longitudinal one. The pupils \nin the upper grade (called \u201cYear 1\u201d in England) are the same in both datasets, but the lower \ngrade (reception) pupils are not. The analyses of the cross-sectional data relate to a comparison \nof two distinct groups of pupils that were assessed at the same time, namely in September 2004. \nThe upper grade pupils were born in the period September 1998 \u2013 August 1999 and the lower \ngrade ones one year later, in the period September 1999 \u2013 August 2000. The longitudinal \nanalyses relate to a comparison of the scores obtained by the same pupils at two different points \nin time, namely in September 2004 (when they were in the upper grade) and September 2003 \n(when they were in the lower grade and thus one year younger). See also table 2.  \n \nVariables \nThe dependent variables in the analysis are pupil achievement for mathematics, reading and \nphonics. The test was constructed to provide measures of the best predictors of later \nachievement in school. As such it includes the precursors to reading and mathematics and this \nextends to reading per se and into mathematics (arithmetic) (see Tymms, 1999b). There are 17 \nsections in the assessment with some additional voluntary sections, which are not used in this \npaper. The sections can be grouped into reading, mathematics and phonics. Areas assessed \ninclude name writing, picture vocabulary, concepts about print, letter identification, reading \nsimple words and reading more complex sentences, which combine into the reading score; word \nrepeating and identifying pairs of rhyming words, which combine into the phonics score; ideas \nabout maths, counting, informal simple sums, number recognition, shapes and formal maths \nwhich combine into the mathematics score. An example will give a feel for the test.  \n \n 8 \nFor letter identification the child is shown letters of the alphabet in order of their empirically \nestablished difficulty. It starts with the first letter of the child\u201fs name and proceeds through \nmany letters with a mixture of upper and lower case letters. The test algorithm is that when \nthree in a row are answered incorrectly or four altogether the section is halted and the child \nmoves to the next section. Some more sample questions are presented at the home page of the \nCEM centre (http:\/\/www.cemcentre.org\/). \n \nSchools use the same assessment both on entry to school and for the follow-up assessment. In \norder to reduce the time spent by schools on the re-test, pupils are not re-assessed on sections \nthey completed adequately at the start of the year and instead are credited with full marks in \nthose sections. However, whilst this saves a lot of time for schools, there is the risk that some \nchildren will be credited for items that they would have got wrong. We are able to empirically \nmeasure the size of this difference using data from schools where something unfortunate has \nhappened to their computers. If the computers are stolen, broken or even upgraded, if the school \ndid not keep a backup copy of the data, the children will have to complete the final assessment \nfrom the very beginning. This means they are assessed on those sections for which they should \nhave been credited full marks. As such we can compare their score on the full test with the \ncalculated score if they had been credited the marks. On average this makes a difference of 2.77 \nitems and this correction was applied before the models were set up. \n \nThe assessment has a test-retest reliability of 0.98 (CEM website). As stated previously, the \nassessment was designed to predict later attainment. The correlations between the assessment \nscores at the start of the year, the end of the year, and later PIPS assessments up to the end of \nprimary school, six years later, are all around 0.7 (Tymms 1999, Tymms et al, 2000, and \nTymms et al, 2007). \n \nTable 1 shows the mean and standard deviation for each subject by grade. Figures 1a, 1b and 1c \nprovide a graphical display of the frequency distributions of the scores for maths, reading and \nphonics. Figure 1a shows that in both lower and upper grade the distributions of the maths \nscores present fairly close approximations of the standard normal distribution. The pupils in the \nupper grade get higher scores, but the amount of variation hardly differs between both grades. \nMoreover, the distributions for the cross-sectional and longitudinal data in the lower grade are \nhighly similar. Most important is the apparent absence of any floor or ceiling effects in the \ndistributions, as these might bias the effect estimates. Figure 1b shows the frequency \n 9 \ndistributions for reading. Also in this case the distributions show a fair degree of resemblance \nwith the standard normal distribution in both grades, but the graph displays much more \nvariation for reading in the upper grade. This is also expressed in the size of the standard \ndeviations (see table 1). There is little evidence for any floor or ceiling effects. In the lower \ngrade, the longitudinal and cross-sectional data produce similarly shaped distributions. Figure \n1c, however, shows an unmistakable ceiling effect in the distribution of the phonics scores in \nthe upper grade. In fact 46% of the pupils in the upper grade attained the maximum score on the \nphonics test. This implies that many pupils would most probably have got a higher score, if the \ndiscriminatory power of the test had been higher. However, the ceiling effect is not so \nsurprising when one considers the limited scope of the test (word repeating and identifying pairs \nof rhyming words). With regard to our basic research question, the most important point is that \nthe bias relates to both the cross-sectional and longitudinal dataset. Only if a floor or ceiling \neffect occurs exclusively in either dataset is it possible that this leads to different findings for \nthe cross-sectional versus the longitudinal data. The distributions in the lower grade are again \nquite similar for both the cross-sectional and longitudinal data. \n \nTable 1: Basic statistics given years for when the data were collected \n \n \nLOWER GRADE UPPER GRADE \n \n \ncross-sectional data  longitudinal data cross-sectional and longitudinal \nMathematics       \nAverage score 24.50  24.67  40.42  \nStandard deviation 9.14  8.58  8.43  \nReading       \nAverage score 30.45  29.42  88.51  \nStandard deviation 19.23  15.54  36.00  \nPhonics       \nAverage score 9.07  9.11  14.57  \nStandard deviation 4.46  4.60  3.40  \nNumber of pupils 593  599  599  \n \nGrade and age are the independent variables in the analyses. Grade was recoded to assign scores \nof zero to students in the lower grade and scores of one to students in the upper grade. The \nvariable that denotes a pupil\u201fs age at the date of assessment is based on year and month of birth. \nEach age was transformed into a decimal number. For example, a pupil born in March 1999 and \nassessed in September 2004 received a score of 5.50, and a pupil born in April received a score \nof 5.42. The cut-off value (5.00) was then subtracted from these scores, giving each of the \n 10 \noldest pupils in the lower grade (the comparison group) a score of zero.

The second model includes the effect of the pupil\u201fs age, thereby representing the basic \nregression-discontinuity approach within a multilevel framework, as described in equation (3). \nIn this equation the relation between age and achievement is modelled as a linear function. \nAdditional models were fitted to explore the empirical validity of curvilinear relationships \nbetween age and achievement. We only report the findings that include a quadratic term as the \nanalyses that included cubic terms failed to produce significant improvements of the model fit. \nThe analyses of the longitudinal data entail one important addition. For these data the variance \nof the effect of one year schooling is estimated both at the school and pupil level. For the cross-\nsectional data the variance of this effect can only be estimated at the school level, as the \n 12 \ndifference between the scores in the lower and upper grade cannot be measured at the individual \nlevel. The MLwiN software (Rasbash et al., 2000) was used to analyse the data.  \n \nFindings \nTable 3 shows the basic findings of the analyses. The first model estimates the gross effect of \nbeing in the upper grade. The second model includes the linear effect of age. In the third model \na quadratic term is included. The random effects in table 3 relate to this model (the random \neffects for models 1 & 2 are reported in appendix 1). For all three subjects, in all three models \nand for both the cross-sectional and longitudinal data the effect of being in the upper grade and \nits variance is found to be statistically significant (\u03b1 < .05; two-tailed) given the size of the \nrelevant standard errors. \n \nThe gross effect of one year schooling, which is estimated in model 1, is very similar in the \ncross-sectional and longitudinal dataset for all three \u201csubjects\u201d. Models 2 and 3 show larger \ndifferences between both datasets with regard to the fixed effects of grade, but when these \ndifferences are compared to the standard errors of the effects, none of them can be considered \nstatistically significant. Note that for mathematics and phonics the sign of the quadratic effect is \nnegative in both the longitudinal and cross-sectional datasets, whereas for reading the sign is \npositive in both datasets. A negative sign of the quadratic term indicates that the positive effect \nof age on achievement decreases, as pupils grow older. A positive sign suggests the opposite. \nThe figures 2a, 2b and 2c present graphical displays of the age achievement relationships and \nthe discontinuities between the oldest pupils in the lower grade and youngest in the upper grade. \nThe figures relate to the effects estimated in model 3, which includes a quadratic term for the \neffect of age. For mathematics and reading there is hardly any difference between the lines that \nrepresent the age achievement relation for the cross-sectional and the longitudinal data. Only for \nphonics, which is the most limited in scope of the three measures, is the difference easier to \ndiscern.  \n \n 13 \nTable 3: Comparison of findings with longitudinal and cross-sectional data \n \n \nMATHEMATICS READING PHONICS \n Cross-sectional \ndata \nLongitudinal \ndata \nCross-sectional \ndata \nLongitudinal \ndata \nCross-sectional \ndata \nLongitudinal \ndata \nFIXED EFFECTS \n \n \n           \nModel 1             \nIntercept 24.63 (.84) 24.85 (.93) 31.25 (1.79) 31.35 (2.52) 9.43 (.52) 9.46 (.58) \nGrade 15.81 (1.22) 15.58 (.91) 57.85 (3.50) 57.91 (2.72) 5.35 (.49) 5.33 (.42) \nModel 2             \nIntercept 28.59 (.94) 28.34 (.99) 40.02 (2.14) 38.13 (2.63) 10.50 (.55) 10.61 (.62) \nGrade 7.21 (1.48) 7.75 (1.35) 38.77 (4.01) 42.80 (3.30) 3.03 (.61) 2.75 (.62) \nAge 8.43 (.78) 7.83 (1.00) 18.71 (2.25) 15.07 (1.86) 2.26 (.36) 2.56 (.45) \nModel 3             \nIntercept 29.06 (1.00) 28.78 (1.00) 39.07 (2.11) 40.70 (2.68) 10.56 (.58) 11.11 (.65) \nGrade 7.08 (1.48) 7.55 (1.35) 32.48 (4.16) 30.19 (4.00) 3.01 (.61) 2.31 (.64) \nAge 8.65 (.80) 8.15 (1.01) 23.84 (2.53) 26.63 (2.91) 2.30 (.37) 3.10 (.48) \nAge\n2 \n-1.20 (.76) -1.07 (.43) 11.06 (2.56) 9.15 (1.78) -.14 (.36) -.91 (.25) \nRANDOM EFFECTS (Model 3) \n \n \n          \nSchool level             \nVariance intercept 11.08 (4.54) 11.01 (4.53) 47.08 (19.71) 103.05 (37.40) 4.36 (1.66) 5.55 (2.11) \nVariance grade effect 22.71 (9.28) 12.91 (4.87) 122.79 (58.62) 89.16 (38.67) 3.17 (1.39) 2.85 (1.13) \nCovariance -7.88 (5.21) -3.43 (3.48) 7.11 (24.16) -6.22 (26.99) -3.33 (1.42) -3.73 (1.47) \nCorrelation -.50 (not sign.)  -.29 (not sign.) .09 (not sign.) -.06 (not sign.) -.90 -.94 \nPupil level             \nVariance intercept 66.82 (3.94) 59.52 (3.49) 316.16 (18.64) 179.96 (10.56) 15.43 (.91) 16.52 (.97) \nVariance grade effect --- --- 34.70 (2.04) --- --- 634.32 (37.19) --- --- 12.28 (.72) \nCovariance -7.35 (2.49) -21.02 (2.08) 359.78 (31.76) 111.27 (14.75) -2.52 (.55) -9.21 (.70) \nCorrelation cannot be computed -.46 cannot be computed .33 cannot be computed -.65 \n \nThe figures in between brackets denote the standard errors.  \nThe random effects for models 1and 2 are reported in appendix 1.\n 14 \nTable 3 also shows that the variance of the grade effect between schools is larger in the cross-\nsectional dataset for all three subjects. The difference between both datasets for reading equals \n33.63 (122.79 \u2013 89.16), which is smaller than the standard error in either dataset (namely 58.62 \nand 38.67). The same goes for phonics: the difference amounts to .32 (3.17 \u2013 2.85), while the \nstandard errors equal 1.39 and 1.13. With regard to mathematics the findings are less clear-cut. \nThe difference between both datasets equals 9.80 (22.71 \u2013 12.91), which is hardly larger than \nthe standard error in the cross-sectional dataset (9.28) but over twice as large as the standard \nerror in the longitudinal dataset (4.87). With regard to the basic research question of this study \nthe most important finding is that the cross-sectional data do not produce an outcome that \ncontradicts the estimate based on the longitudinal data. If one would use the cross-sectional data \nto construct a 95% confidence interval for the school level variance of the grade effect, it would \nstill include the value obtained with the longitudinal data. It should be noted, though, that the \nlow number of schools in this study (18) is bound to produce large standard errors and wide \nconfidence intervals. It is also worth mentioning that when the variation of the grade effect \nacross schools is expressed in terms of standard deviations rather than variances, the disparities \nbetween the cross-sectional and the longitudinal results look much more modest. In that case the \nresult for mathematics is 4.77 (\u221a22.71) in the cross-sectional dataset versus 3.59 (\u221a12.91) in the \nlongitudinal dataset. For reading the contrast is 11.08(\u221a122.79) vs. 9.44(\u221a89.16) and for \nphonics it is 1.78(\u221a3.17) vs. 1.69(\u221a2.85).  \n \nThe findings for reading show some differences between the longitudinal and cross-sectional \ndata with regard to the intercept variance at both the school and pupil level. The school level \nvariance is considerably larger in the longitudinal dataset, while the pupil level variance is much \nlower. This means that with regard to the school and pupil level variance for reading the pupils \nin the cross-sectional dataset are not equivalent to the ones in the longitudinal dataset. Note that \nboth datasets display much more similarity with regard to the variances of the grade effect for \nreading between schools. Even though the cross-sectional and longitudinal data show some \ndifferences with regard to the variation in reading scores (see also table 2), this does not \npreclude fairly similar outcomes concerning the variance of the grade effect.  \n \n 15 \nFigure 2a \n \n \nFigure 2b \n \n \nRelationship between age and maths score\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n4 years                                          5 years                                            6 years\nPupils' age\nM\na\nth\ns \nsc\no\nre\nCross-sectional data Longitudinal data\nupper gradelower grade\nRelationship between age and reading score\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n4 years                                         5 years                                           6 years  \nPupils' age\nR\ne\na\nd\nin\ng\n s\nc\no\nre\nCross-sectional data Longitudinal data\nupper gradelower grade\n 16 \nFigure 2c \n \n \nWith regard to mathematics and reading none of the covariances at the school level between the \nintercept and the grade effect are significantly different from zero in either dataset. In the case \nof mathematics this is largely due to the low number of schools. The actual sizes of the \ncovariances are substantial. The corresponding correlations equal -.50 and -.29 for the cross-\nsectional and longitudinal data respectively. For phonics, the covariance does deviate \nsignificantly from zero in both datasets. The negative covariance indicate that the effect of one \nyear schooling is relatively low in schools with high intercepts, i.e. in schools where the scores \nfor phonics are high in the lower grade. The covariances correspond to correlations equal to -.90 \nand -.94 in the cross-sectional and longitudinal dataset respectively. The main cause for these \nextremely strong correlations is presumably the ceiling effect in the frequency distribution of \nthe phonics scores in the upper grade (see figure 1c). This precludes substantial progress in \nschools with high levels of achievement in the lower grade.   \n \nFor the longitudinal datasets it also possible to calculate the correlation between the intercept \nand the grade effect at the pupil level. For the cross-sectional data the variance of the effect of \none year schooling can only be estimated at the school level. The covariances at the pupil level \nfor the cross-sectional data only express the extent to which the pupil level variance is higher or \nlower in the upper grade. The negative covariances for mathematics and phonics indicate less \npupil level variance in the upper grade and the positive covariance for reading denotes more \nRelationship between age and phonics score\n7\n9\n11\n13\n15\n17\n4 years                                          5 years                                            6 years\nPupils' age\nP\nh\no\nn\nic\ns \nsc\no\nre\nCross-sectional data Longitudinal data\nlower grade upper grade\n 17 \nvariance. All pupil level covariances are statistically significant. The covariance for phonics \npoints to a strong and negative correlation (-.65) between intercept and grade effect at the pupil \nlevel. The effect of one year extra schooling is relatively small for pupils with high scores for \nphonics in the lower grade. It seems plausible that this (partly) reflects the ceiling effect in the \ndistribution of the phonics scores (see figure 1c). A negative correlation (-.46) was also found \nfor mathematics. The correlation for reading is positive (.33), which implies that the grade \neffect for reading is stronger if a pupil scored already high on reading in the lower grade. \n \nThe effect of one year schooling for mathematics in model 3 is 7.08 and 7.55 in the cross-\nsectional and longitudinal dataset respectively. For reading the effects are 32.48 and 30.19 and \nfor phonics they are 3.01 and 2.31. These figures reflect the difference in achievement between \nthe upper and lower grade after adjusting for the effect of age. When comparing the adjusted \ndifferences to the unadjusted differences (see table 3, model 1) one can compute the proportion \nof the difference in achievement between two grades that is accounted for by schooling. For \nexample, the unadjusted difference between the lower and upper grade is 15.81 for mathematics \nin the cross-sectional dataset and the adjusted difference is 7.08. About 45% of the original \ndifference remains after adjusting for age. Therefore 55% of the difference between grades must \nbe attributed to the effect of age and 45% to the effect of schooling. Figure 3 displays the \npercentages for all three subjects in both the cross-sectional and longitudinal dataset. \n \nThe proportions in the longitudinal and cross-sectional dataset are slightly different for \nmathematics and reading, but in general the patterns are quite similar. For phonics the \nproportions in the cross-sectional and longitudinal data show the largest difference, namely 44% \nversus 57%. This difference reflects the previously reported lower effect of being in the upper \ngrade in the longitudinal dataset (see table 3). It should be noted, though, that the difference \n(3.01 \u2013 2.31 = .70) between the effects in both datasets cannot be considered statistically \nsignificant as it hardly exceeds the standard errors in either dataset (.61 and .64).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 18 \nFigure 3 \n \n \nAnother matter of concern is whether the analyses of both datasets yield consistent estimates of \nthe grade effect for each school. Using MLwiN the predicted grade effect per school can be \nobtained. These effects are graphically displayed in figures 4a, 4b and 4c. Appendix 2 provides \nthe exact figures for each school. The effects relate to model 3, i.e. the effect of one year extra \nschooling after taking into account the linear and quadratic effect of age on achievement.    \n \nIn general, the figures show a considerable degree of consistency between the longitudinal and \ncross-sectional data. The grade effect that is estimated for a school in the cross-sectional dataset \nis usually similar to the effect estimated with the longitudinal data. Nevertheless the effects are \nnever completely identical. The correlation between both effects is modest for phonics (.52) and \nstrong for mathematics and reading (.71 and .78 respectively). The figures 4a, 4b and 4c also \nreveal that the effect of one year schooling is nearly always positive. Negative effects are \nexceptional, but they do occur. For one school the grade effect on mathematics achievement is \nnegative in both datasets, whereas none of the schools shows a negative effect for reading. With \nregard to phonics there is one school with a negative effect, but this is only found in the \nlongitudinal dataset. In the cross-sectional dataset the same school gets a small positive effect. \n \n \n \nRelative size of age and grade effect\n45%\n48%\n56%\n52%\n56%\n43%\n55%\n52%\n44%\n48%\n44%\n57%\nCross-sectional\nLongitudinal\nCross-sectional\nLongitudinal\nCross-sectional\nLongitudinal\nM\na\nth\ns\nR\ne\na\nd\nin\ng\nP\nh\no\nn\nic\ns\nGrade effect Age effect\n 19 \nFigure 4a \n \n \n \nFigure 4b \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPredicted grade effect per school for maths\n-4\n0\n4\n8\n12\n16\nCorrelation between effects based on cross-sectional and longitudinal data: .71\nLongitudinal data Cross-sectional data\nAverage longitudinal data Average cross-sectional data\nPredicted grade effect per school for reading\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nCorrelation between effects based on cross-sectional and longitudinal data: .78\nLongitudinal data Cross-sectional data\nAverage longitudinal data Average cross-sectional data\n 20 \nFigure 4c \n \n \nSummary and discussion \nThe key question of this study is whether it is possible to make a valid assessment of the effects \nof schooling using cross-sectional data when making use of the regression-discontinuity \napproach. Our analyses focused on the effect of one year schooling and its variation across \nschools. None of the findings for the cross-sectional data appear to differ significantly from the \nfindings produced by the longitudinal data. It should be noted, however, that the sizes of the \ndatasets in this study are modest, so that only fairly large differences will meet moderate \nsignificance criteria. Therefore it is advisable to consider the observed differences between the \ndatasets as well. With regard to mathematics and reading the grade effects, i.e. the \ndiscontinuities between the oldest pupils in the lower grade and the youngest ones in the upper \ngrade are highly similar for both datasets (see figures 2a and 2b). The percentages of the \ndifferences in achievement between both grades that can be accounted for by schooling are only \nslightly different between the two datasets for mathematics and reading (see figure 3). With \nregard to phonics the correspondence between the findings for the cross-sectional and \nlongitudinal data is less strong, but still the results are largely similar. \n \nThe analyses show more variance of the grade effect across schools for all three subjects in the \ncross-sectional dataset. Whether cross-sectional data consistently produce higher estimates for \nthe school level variance of the grade effect is a question that requires further study. It seems \nPredicted grade effect per school for phonics\n-2\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\nCorrelation between effects based on cross-sectional and longitudinal data: .52\nLongitudinal data Cross-sectional data\nAverage longitudinal data Average cross-sectional data\n 21 \npossible that the variance of the grade effect is somewhat overestimated when the analysis is \nbased on cross-sectional data. In the case of longitudinal data the variation of the grade effect at \nboth the school and pupil level can be assessed, which may lead to a more accurate and possibly \nlower estimate of the school level variance. Our findings suggest that not only the estimated \nvariances of the grade effects tend to be larger for cross-sectional data, but also the \ncorresponding standard errors. In the present study the consequence is that confidence intervals \nfor the estimates based on cross-sectional data would still include the values estimated with the \nlongitudinal dataset. The predicted grade effects per school reveal a considerable degree of \nconsistency across both datasets. The correlations are moderate for phonics (.52) and strong for \nreading and mathematics (.78 and .71 respectively).  \n \nIn most respects the findings of this study suggest an affirmative answer to the question whether \nit is possible to assess the effect of schooling without controlling for prior achievement. The \nrisk of obtaining biased estimates of the grade effect when the analysis is based on cross-\nsectional data seems limited. This points to an important practical advantage of the regression-\ndiscontinuity approach. Collecting longitudinal data requires more time, effort and money than \ncross-sectional data. Moreover longitudinal data often suffer from bias due to selective attrition.  \n \nIn addition to the practical advantages great importance can be attached to the conceptual \nbenefits of the regression-discontinuity approach. First of all, it gives a different perspective on \nthe impact of schooling. Whereas the multilevel analyses that focus on relative differences \nbetween schools find that ten to fifteen percent of the variance in test scores is situated at the \nschool level, the regression-discontinuity approach indicates that schooling accounts for a much \nlarger proportion of the cognitive development of pupils. The percentages reported in this study \n\u2013 on average 50% \u2013 are relatively low in comparison to those reported by Cahan & Davis \n(1987) and Luyten (2006). As mentioned in the introduction section these percentages relate to \nan aspect of the effect of schooling that is different from what is expressed by the usually \nreported percentages of school level variance. When these percentages are converted to effect \nsizes that have been defined in relation to interventions in which there is a control and an \nexperimental group, it is found that 10% to15% school level variance corresponds to an effect \nsize of .67 to.70 (see Tymms, 2004). Preliminary calculations on the findings reported in table 3 \nsuggest that converting the effects of one year extra schooling yield similar effect sizes.  \n \n 22 \nProbably the most important advantage of the regression-discontinuity approach is that it allows \nfor an assessment of the absolute effect of schooling. Clearly the usual school effectiveness \nresearch \u201cschool effects\u201d merely relate to a school\u201fs relative position in comparison to other \nschools. Thus one will always find that 50% of the schools score above average and 50% \nbelow, regardless the overall quality of education in a country. With the regression-\ndiscontinuity approach it is possible to express the effect of schooling on a scale that has a \nmeaningful zero-level. A zero effect implies that the difference in test scores between two \nconsecutive grades can be attributed completely to the fact that the pupils in the upper grade are \none year older. In a multilevel framework this effect can be estimated per school, so that it is \npossible to detect schools with a zero or even negative impact on the development of the pupils. \n \nIn the present study one school out of eighteen was found to have a negative effect for \nmathematics in both datasets. Another school showed a negative effect with regard to phonics in \nthe longitudinal dataset, whereas a small positive effect was found in the cross-sectional dataset \nfor this school. The study by Luyten (2006), which also applies the regression-discontinuity \napproach, reports a negative effect in 23% and 27% of the English primary schools for \nmathematics and science achievement respectively. These findings came from a secondary \nanalysis of the TIMSS-95 data and relate to pupils in grade three and four in a large number of \ncountries (Mullis et al., 1997; Martin et al., 1997). The relative effects of schooling found in the \npresent study (50% on average) are considerably larger than the percentages reported for the \nEnglish pupils in the analyses of the TIMSS-95 data, which are 38% for maths and 34% for \nscience. Possible explanations for these differences may be the age of the pupils and the \ncurriculum alignment of the tests used to measure pupil achievement. The TIMSS-95 data relate \nto nine and ten year olds, while the present analyses focused on four and five year olds. We \nknow that the effect of age diminishes as children grow older (Jones and Jellis, 2005) but that \nrelates to the age\/achievement relationship within a year group. We hypothesise that there is an \nadditional increment by grade effect which is greatest for the youngest children. Consider \nlearning to read. This is a major accomplishment often achieved during the first year at school \nand it is difficult to conceive of a jump of comparable magnitude in later years. Similar \nexamples can be given for mathematics. The youngest children make the greatest leaps. Finding \na school where young children have not moved forward is a great surprise. With regard to \ncurriculum alignment we cannot be sure. The test-curriculum overlap in the present study is not \nclear and it may also not be tight in the case of TIMSS-95.  \n \n 23 \nThe findings from this study suggest that there is no need to control for background \ncharacteristics in a study that uses the regression-discontinuity approach in order to assess the \neffect of education. Nevertheless, studies dealing with the effects of background characteristics \nsuch as gender, family background and ethnicity on the outcomes of schooling are still valuable. \nIn the context of a regression-discontinuity analysis the research should focus on the question to \nwhat extent the effect of one year extra schooling is stronger or weaker for certain groups of \npupils. This would require including interaction effects of student characteristics with grade in \nthe data analysis. Effects of school and classroom variables can be modelled in the same \nmanner. See also the contribution by Verachtert et al., which reports different learning rates by \nsocioeconomic background. \n \nIn the present study we did not address the impact of student and school characteristics, but it is \nquite plausible that these variables account to some extent for the variance of the grade effect \nacross schools. What the results of our analyses show, is the average effect of one year \nschooling across different kinds of pupils and schools. Still it seems likely that, for example, the \ngrade effect is stronger for pupils with highly educated parents. In that case, the educational \nlevel of the parents can account for part of the variance of the grade effect between schools. \n \nAs has already been noted the present study relates to a fairly small dataset and to a specific \ngroup of pupils, namely four and five year olds, but we expect that future research will provide \nfurther support for the assumption that in many respects cross-sectional data suffice for a valid \nassessment of the impact of schooling. This requires replications of the present study on larger \ndatasets and other age ranges. Another important topic for subsequent studies is the comparison \nof the interaction effects of pupil and school characteristics with the grade effect between \nlongitudinal and cross-sectional data.  \n \nIn conclusion we want to emphasize the basic requirements for application of the regression-\ndiscontinuity approach in future research on educational effectiveness. First of all the approach \ncan only be applied if the data relate to two (or more) adjacent grades. In their contribution \nKyriakides & Luyten illustrate how the approach can be applied to a dataset that covers more \nthan two grades in a row. However, regression-discontinuity can not be applied to assess the \neffect of schooling if the dataset relates to non-neighboring grades (e.g. grades 2 and 4).  \n \n 24 \nAnother crucial requirement involves the comparability of the outcomes measures across \ngrades. In the present study the same test is used in both grades. This may not always be \nfeasible, especially if the analysis covers a wide range of grades. Using exactly the same tests in \nall grades is not necessary. The key point is that the tests used in the various grades relate to a \ncommon scale. This can be achieved by equating techniques based on classical test theory or \nitem response theory.  \n \nCorrect modeling of the age-achievement relation is another point of crucial importance. If a \nlinear function is fitted, while the real relation is curvilinear, the estimated effect of schooling \nmay be biased. It is also worth mentioning that the approach does not require a strong or \nstatistically significant relationship between age and achievement. As students grow older one \nmay expect a diminishing link to age, but this does not affect the validity of the approach. If the \nrelation between the selection criterion and the outcome measure were close to zero, one would \nactually approximate random assignment to grades (Trochim, 1984). However, it is of the \nutmost importance to emphasize that regression-discontinuity assumes a strict adherence to the \ncut-off point. In the present study the percentage of students with non-standard school careers is \nnegligibly small (1.5%), but the \u201emisclassification\u201f of pupils presents a serious problem \nregarding the usefulness of the regression-discontinuity approach in many countries where other \nfactors besides date of birth influence assignment to grades. Grade retention is undoubtedly one \nof the main reasons why assignment to grade level does not always agree with a cut-off point \nbased on date of birth. Only in a restricted number of the countries is the proportion of \n\u201emisclassifications\u201f small enough to obtain reliable estimates of the grade effect without \nconsidering other factors. The greatest challenge will be to develop valid methods for taking \ninto account the effects of these other factors when assessing the effect of schooling. \nAddressing the \u201emisclassification\u201f issue as a selection bias problem seems a promising \napproach. When trying to assess the grade effect we are faced with the problem that assignment \nto grades (in the guise of grade-repeating or grade-skipping) is partly determined by factors that \naffect the outcomes of learning (Luyten & Veldkamp, 2008).  \n \n 25 \nReferences \nAdams, S., Alexander, E., Drummond, M.
