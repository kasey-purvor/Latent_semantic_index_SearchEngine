There has been numerous works to relax these assumptions as it is\nnow well known that the markets do not operate frictionless and are not perfectly\ncompetitive (see, e.g., [2], [3], [11], [12], [13], [14] [17] and [20]).\nRelaxation of both the frictionless and competitive market hypotheses introduces\nthe notion of liquidity risk. Roughly speaking the liquidity risk is the additional risk\ndue to the timing and size of a trade. Recently, several authors have proposed a number\nof methods to incorporate the liquidity risk into asset pricing theory (see [1], [4], [5], [6]\nand [27]). The common characteristic of all these works is that the liquidity risk appears\nas some nonlinear transaction cost which appears due to the imbalance between the\nsupply and demand in the financial market which is relevant if an agent is attempting\nto trade large volumes in a short time.\nIn the literature dealing with the modeling of \u2018liquidity risk\u2019 one can clearly identify\ntwo different approaches. In the first approach, the modeler concentrates on the effects\nof the large trader\u2019s portfolio on the price of the stock (see, e.g., [17], [26], [29], [28],\n[18]). The authors postulate a feedback function that governs the dependence of the\nequilibrium stock price on the portfolio actions of the large trader. We call this class\nof models \u2018models of feedback effects.\u2019 The second class of models, e.g. [4], [5], [6], [27],\nignores the feedback effects of the trades and concentrates on the equalization of the\nsupply and demand locally in time so that trade volume does not have a lasting impact\non the asset price. Consequently the wealth process of a trader in an illiquid market\ncan be decomposed into two components such that one comes from the gains\/losses\ndue to the changes in the fundamental value of the stock, which does not depend on\nthe history of the trades, and the other is the liquidity costs incurred over time due to\nthe changes in the position. In other words this class of models studies the behavior\nof price-taking traders in markets where the change of one\u2019s position has additional\nliquidity costs.\nIn this work we stay within the framework of second class of models. In particu-\nlar, we follow the model suggested by C\u00b8etin, Jarrow and Protter [4] who introduced\nthe so-called \u201csupply curve\u201d to model the asset price as a function of size and time.\nStarting with the given supply curve for, say, the stock, the authors show in [4] that\nthe existence of the liquidity costs makes the trading strategies with infinite quadratic\nvariation infeasible since they incur infinite liquidity costs. One important consequence\nof their modeling is that the continuous trading strategies of finite variation incur no\nliquidity costs; thus, the market is approximately complete (in an L2-sense) if there\nexists a unique equivalent martingale measure for the \u2018marginal price process\u2019 (see [4]\nfor details). In particular, they show that in a Black-Scholes type economy with liq-\nuidity costs the price of an option is given by the standard Black-Scholes formula and\nthe approximate hedging strategy can be obtained by some appropriate averaging of\nthe Black-Scholes hedge (see [5] for some further results and numerical and empirical\nstudies).\nOn the other hand, the liquidity model of [4] produces a nonzero liquidity premium\nfor options when considered in discrete time (see [6] and results therein). If one looks at\nthe self-financing condition in [4] in continuous time, which we recall in Section 2, one\nnotices that the self-financing condition is defined to be the limit of the self-financing\nconditions in discrete time when the time step tends to zero. The discrete-time version\nof the self-financing condition of [4] is very natural since the only assumption on the\nliquidity cost, other than measurability, is that the bigger the position to liquidate\nthe larger is the liquidity cost. Therefore, one naturally wonders what happens to the\n3liquidity premium when one passes to the continuous-time limit as it is shown by [4]\nthat the pricing formulas for the contingent claims in their model coincide with those\nin the frictionless markets.\nWe see this situation as a paradox of the liquidity model of [4] and argue in this\npaper that the absence of the liquidity premium is linked to the choice of the set\nof admissible strategies and show that one can find a nonzero liquidity premium in\ncontinuous time for a set of admissible strategies appropriately defined.\nThe correct choice of an admissible set of strategies is crucial even in frictionless\nmarkets. Indeed, in models of markets with no friction in discrete time, no conditions,\nother than adaptability, is needed to impose on the trading strategies in order to\nsolve the problems of pricing, hedging and utility maximization. However, as soon as\nwe consider the continuous-time limit of these models, the price of any contingent\nclaim becomes unbounded from below (i.e., \u2212\u221e) and the value function of the utility\nmaximization problem will typically be unbounded (i.e.,\u221e) as one can create arbitrage\nopportunities due to the existence of doubling strategies. It is now well-known that\nthis paradox can be solved by imposing certain restrictions on the trading strategies,\nsuch as certain integrability or lower bound assumptions on the strategies. The notion\nof admissibility in frictionless markets is now well-understood as an integral part of\nfinancial modeling. We believe that the apparent paradox in the model of [4] can be\nsolved in a similar way by an appropriate choice of admissibility condition in illiquid\nmarkets. The main purpose of this paper is to define a convenient set of admissible\nstrategies so that the liquidity cost does not vanish in the continuous-time limit. This\nis achieved by placing constraints on the dynamics of the trading strategies and their\ncorresponding gamma processes as in [7]. In a recent paper, Go\u00a8kay and Soner [19]\nshowed that the continuous time limit of the corresponding Binomial model yields\nexactly the same pricing equation as in this paper. Since the trading strategies in the\nBinomial model are not restricted, the convergence result of [19] supports our choice\nof admissible strategies.\nThe restrictions that we place on the trading strategies in this paper can be seen\nas a relaxation of the restrictions in [22]. First of all, we allow a trading strategy to\nhave infinite variation. More precisely, the admissible trading strategies form a larger\nsubset of semimartingales (see (2.3)). As seen, the finite variation part of a trading\nstrategy consists of a pure-jump component and an absolutely continuous component.\nThe remaining infinite variation part is an integral with respect to the marginal price\nprocess of the stock, which is a martingale since we work under the unique risk-neutral\nmeasure for the marginal price process. The integrand in the absolutely continuous\npart of the trading strategy can be viewed as the rate of change of the trading strategy\nwith respect to time while the integrand in the infinite variation part can be seen as\nthe rate of change with respect to the changes in the stock price. As in [22] we assume\nthese \u2018derivatives\u2019 are bounded (see Section 2 for the exact definitions). However, we\ndo not impose uniform bounds over all admissible strategies. The price to pay for this\nrelaxation is that we are no longer happy with the mere L2-convergence but price\ncontingent claims using super-replication arguments. We show that a trading strategy\nthat attains the minimal super-replication cost is a perfect replicating strategy and its\ncost of construction contains a liquidity premium, in contrast with the results of [4].\nA related work on such trading restrictions can be found in Longstaff [22] who\nsuggests a uniform bound on the time derivative of trading strategies to study the\noptimal portfolios in an illiquid market. More recently, Rogers and Singh [27] studied\n4the Merton problem under liquidity costs where they placed similar restrictions on the\ntrading strategies.\nUnder our admissibility condition, we show in Proposition 1 that those strategies\nwith jumps are not optimal so that the super-hedging problem can be restricted to\ncontinuous hedging strategies. This feature of our admissibility set is thus in agreement\nwith the conventional wisdom according to which it is better to place consecutive small\ntrades rather than a large one at once in illiquid markets. Our main result, Theorem 1,\nproves that the super-replication price V is the unique viscosity solution of the dynamic\nprogramming equation\n\u2212Vt \u2212 s\n2\u03c32\n4`\n[\n\u2212`2 +\n(\n(Vss + `)\n+\n)2]\n= 0 . (1.1)\nwhere the function ` > 0 is the liquidity index of the market defined in (2.5), below. In\nfact, for more liquid markets ` is larger, with ` = \u221e referring to the complete Black-\nScholes model. Using this equation, it is easy to show that, unless the pay-off is affine,\nthe solution to this equation is strictly larger than the Black-Scholes price. Hence there\nis a liquidity premium. This is proved in Corollary 1. Moreover, this liquidity premium\ncan be calculated numerically using available methods for the solutions of PDEs of\ntype (1.1).\nThese results are proved by the techniques developed in a series of papers by Soner\nand Touzi [30\u201333], by Cheridito, Soner and Touzi in [7,8] and by Cheridito, Soner,\nTouzi and Victoir in [9].\nAlthough the set of admissible strategies that we consider is motivated by techni-\ncal integrability conditions, our results are comforted by a formal description of the\ncorresponding hedging strategy which has a relevant financial interpretation. As we il-\nlustrate in Section 4 the optimal hedging strategy exhibits an asymmetry between the\nclaims with convex and concave payoffs. For derivatives with convex payoff the hedging\nstrategy is of dynamic Black-Scholes type. However, when the claim to be hedged has\na concave payoff there are two options for the trader: either employ a buy-and-hold\nstrategy at a higher cost of construction but no further liquidity costs, or employ a\nperfect Black-Scholes type replicating strategy but expect liquidity costs growing over\ntime. Depending on the market conditions it might be cheaper to use the buy-and-hold\ntype hedge than the replicating strategy when the liquidity cost associated with the\nreplicating strategy is expected to be high. In Section 4 we show that this decision\nshould be based on the level of concavity of the value function for the minimal super-\nreplication price and give a precise level below which it is cheaper to use a buy-and-hold\nstrategy.\nThe outline of the paper is as follows. Section 2 formulates the problem. Section 3\npresents the main results. Section 4 describes the formal hedging strategy. Section 5\nshows the viscosity property of the dynamic programming equation. Section 6 discusses\nthe terminal condition, Section 7 finds the growth condition for the value function,\nwhile Section 8 shows the uniqueness of the solution. In the Appendix, we discuss the\nconvexity properties and an illustrative example.\n2 Problem formulation\nThroughout this paper, we fix a finite time horizon T > 0, and we consider a one-\ndimensional Brownian motion W = {W (t) , 0 \u2264 t \u2264 T} defined on a complete proba-\n5bility space (\u2126,F ,P). We denote by F = {F(t) , 0 \u2264 t \u2264 T} the smallest filtration that\ncontains the filtration generated by W and satisfies the usual conditions.\n2.1 The financial market\nThe financial market consists of two assets, and the objective of the investor is to\noptimally allocate his wealth between these assets in order to hedge some contingent\nliability.\nThe first asset is non-risky. Without loss of generality, we normalize its price to\nunity, which means that this asset is taken as the nume\u00b4raire.\nThe risky asset is subject to liquidity cost. Following C\u00b8etin, Jarrow and Protter\n[4], we account for the liquidity cost by modeling the price process of this asset as a\nfunction of the exchanged volume. We thus introduce a supply curve\nS (t, S(t), \u03bd) ,\nwhere \u03bd \u2208 R indicates the volume of the transaction, the process S(t) = S (t, S(t), 0)\nis the marginal price process defined by the stochastic differential equation\ndS(r)\nS(r)\n= \u00b5 (r, S(r)) dr + \u03c3 (r, S(r)) dW (r) (2.2)\nand some given initial condition S(0), and S : R+\u00d7R+\u00d7R \u2212\u2192 R is a smooth function\nrepresenting the price per share for some given volume of transaction and the marginal\nprice. In addition to the technical conditions imposed in [4] on the supply curve, we\nassume for each t and s,\n\u2202S\n\u2202\u03bd\n(t, s, 0) > 0.\nIn order to ensure that the stochastic differential equation (2.2) has a unique strong\ncondition, we assume that the coefficient functions \u00b5, \u03c3 : [0, T ]\u00d7R+ \u2212\u2192 R satisfy the\nusual local Lipschitz and linear growth conditions.\nIn order to exclude arbitrage opportunities, we assume the existence of an equiva-\nlent martingale measure P0, i.e.\ndS(r)\nS(r)\n= \u03c3 (r, S(r)) dW 0(r) ,\nwhere W 0 is a standard Brownian motion under P0, so that the process S is a martin-\ngale under P0.\nWe shall frequently move the time origin from zero to an arbitrary t \u2208 [0, T ], and we\nwill denote by {St,s(r), r \u2208 [t, T ]} the process defined by (2.2) and the initial condition\nSt,s(t) = s.\n62.2 Trading strategies\nA trading strategy is defined by a pair (X,Y ) where X(t) denotes the wealth in the\nbank, and Y (t) is the number of shares held at each time t in the portfolio. For reasons\nwhich will be clear later, we restrict the process Y to be of the form\nY (r) =\nN\u22121\u2211\nn=0\nyn1{r\u2265\u03c4n+1} +\n\u222b r\nt\n\u03b1(u)du+\n\u222b r\nt\n\u0393 (u)dSt,s(u) , (2.3)\nso that it has finite quadratic variation. Here, t = \u03c40 < \u03c41 < . . . is an increasing\nsequence of [t, T ]-valued F\u2212stopping times, the random variable\nN := inf{n \u2208 N : \u03c4n = T}\nindicates the number of jumps, yn is an Rd-valued, F(\u03c4n)\u2212measurable random variable\nsatisfying yn1{\u03c4n=T} = 0; \u03b1 and \u0393 are two F\u2212progressively measurable real processes.\nWe will show in the next section that it is not optimal to have jumps in Y .\nWe continue by deriving the continuous-time dynamics of our state variables. This\nderivation follows the discrete-time argument of [4]. Let t = t0 < . . . < tn = T be a\npartition of the interval [0, T ], and set \u03b4\u03c8(ti) := \u03c8(ti) \u2212 \u03c8(ti\u22121) for any function \u03c8.\nBy the self-financing condition, it follows that\n\u03b4X(ti) + \u03b4Y (ti)S (ti, Sti , \u03b4Y (ti)) = 0 , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n .\nSumming up these equalities, it follows from direct manipulations that\nX(T ) + Y (T )S(T ) = X(t) + Y (t)S(t)\n\u2212\nn\u2211\ni=1\n[\u03b4Y (ti)S (ti, Sti , \u03b4Y (ti)) + (Y (t)S(t)\u2212 Y (T )S(T ))]\n= X(t) + Y (t)S(t)\u2212\nn\u2211\ni=1\n[\u03b4Y (ti)S(ti) + (Y (t)S(t)\u2212 Y (T )S(T ))]\n\u2212\nn\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b4Y (ti) [S (ti, Sti , \u03b4Y (ti))\u2212 S (ti)]\n= X(t) + Y (t)S(t) +\nn\u2211\ni=1\nY (ti\u22121)\u03b4S(ti)\n\u2212\nn\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b4Y (ti) [S (ti, Sti , \u03b4Y (ti))\u2212 S (ti)] . (2.4)\nThe continuous-time dynamics of the process\nZ := X + Y S\nare obtained by taking limits in (2.4) as the time step of the partition max{(ti \u2212\nti\u22121), 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n} shrinks to zero. The last sum term in (2.4) is the term due to the\nliquidity cost. Under the smoothness assumption on \u03bd 7\u2212\u2192 S(t, s, \u03bd), it follows that\nn\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b4Y (ti) [S (ti, S(ti), Sti , \u03b4Y (ti))\u2212 S (ti, S(ti), 0)]\n\u2212\u2192\n\u222b T\nt\nd[Y, Y ]cr\n4` (r, S(r))\n+\nN\u22121\u2211\nk=0\nyk\n[\nS\n(\n\u03c4k, S(\u03c4k), y\nk\n)\n\u2212 S (\u03c4k)\n]\n7in probability, where\n`(t, s) :=\n[\n4\n\u2202S\n\u2202\u03bd\n(t, s, 0)\n]\u22121\n. (2.5)\nIn view of the form of the continuous-time process Y in (2.3), this provides\nZ(r) = Z(t) +\n\u222b r\nt\nY (u)dS(u)\u2212\n\u222b r\nt\n1\n4` (r, S(r))\n\u0393 (r)2\u03c3 (r, S(r))2 S(r)2dr (2.6)\n\u2212\nN\u22121\u2211\nk=0\nyk\n[\nS\n(\n\u03c4k, S(\u03c4k), y\nk\n)\n\u2212 S (\u03c4k)\n]\n1{r<\u03c4k+1} .\nIn the absence of jumps in the portfolio process, the process Z approaches the classical\nwealth process in frictionless markets for a large `. Therefore, we will refer to ` as the\nliquidity index of the market.\nIn the absence of liquidity costs, the process Z represents the total value of the\nportfolio of the investor. In the present setting, we assume that the investor is not\nsubject to any liquidity cost at the final time T . Then, although the process Z has\nno direct financial interpretation, its final value Z(T ) is the total value of the investor\nportfolio at time T . A discussion of initial and terminal liquidity costs is given in\nRemark 1.\n2.3 Admissible trading strategies and the hedging problem\nThe purpose of the investor is to hedge without risk some given contingent claim\nG = g (S(T )) for some function g : R+ \u2212\u2192 R .\nIn order to formulate the super-hedging problem in the context of our financial market\nwith liquidity cost, we need to restrict further the trading strategies as in [33].\nFor B, b \u2265 0, and for an F\u2212progressively measurable process {H(r) , t \u2264 r \u2264 T}\ntaking values in R, we define\n\u2016H\u2016B,bt,s :=\n\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 supt\u2264r\u2264T |H(r)|1 + |St,s(r)|B\n\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\nLb(\u2126,F,P)\n.\nThroughout the paper, we fix B > 0. A trading strategy Y defined by (2.3) is said to\nbe admissible if there is a parameter b > 0 such that\n\u2016N\u2016\u221e <\u221e , \u2016Y \u2016B,\u221et,s + \u2016\u0393\u2016B,\u221et,s + \u2016\u03b1\u2016B,bt,s < \u221e ,\nand the process \u0393 is of the form\n\u0393 (r) = \u0393 (t) +\n\u222b r\nt\na(u)du+\n\u222b r\nt\n\u03be(u)dW (u) , (2.7)\nwhere a and \u03be are two real-valued F\u2212progressively measurable processes satisfying,\n\u2016a\u2016B,bt,s + \u2016\u03be\u2016B,2t,s < \u221e .\nClearly a larger parameter B implies a larger admissible set. Hence, the parameter B\ncan be viewed as an indicator of market depth. We refer to [8] and [33] for a justification\n8of such restrictions. In addition, already discussed convergence result of the Binomial\nmodel [19] provides further support for this class of trading strategies.\nAlso, notice that we use the framework of [33] where the restrictions on the drift\nterms \u03b1 and a are relaxed compared to [8]. This relaxation plays a crucial role in the\npresent paper because, in contrast with our previous work [8], the state variable Z in\n(2.6) exhibits a jump term.\nThe collection of all admissible trading strategies Y = {Y (r), 0 \u2264 r \u2264 T} is denoted\nbyAt,s. For every Y \u2208 At,s, we denote by ZYt,z the process defined by (2.6). The purpose\nof this paper is to solve the super-hedging problem\nV (t, s) := inf\n{\nz \u2208 R : ZYt,z(T ) \u2265 g (St,s(T )) for some Y \u2208 At,s\n}\n. (2.8)\nNotice that this formulation ignores the liquidity cost both at the time origin t and the\nfinal time T . As a consequence of Proposition 1 below, the elimination of the initial\nliquidity cost does not entail any loss of generality, see Remark 1. However the absence\nof liquidity cost at the final time is a standing assumption throughout the paper.\nIn the subsequent section, we will prove that we can restrict the portfolios to be\ncontinuous, so that the above value function V coincides with\nV cont(t, s) := inf\n{\nz \u2208 R : ZYt,z(T ) \u2265 g (St,s(T )) for some Y \u2208 Acontt,s\n}\n, (2.9)\nwhere Acontt,s consists of all continuous portfolio processes in At,s.\n3 Main results\nWe need the following mild technical conditions. The first assumption is needed to\nensure that the value function is locally bounded.\ng is bounded from below and sup\ns>0\ng(s)\n1 + s\n< \u221e . (3.10)\nIndeed, the lower bound on g is immediately inherited by V , and the affine growth\ncondition guarantees the existence of a trivial buy-and hold strategy which super-\nhedges the contingent claim g (S(T )), thus producing a locally bounded upper bound\nfor g, see Proposition 2 below.\nWe place the following standard condition on the volatility function,\n\u03c3 is bounded and Lipschitz continuous. (3.11)\nThe following condition on the liquidity function is needed for the comparison result\nof Section 6,\n` is locally Lipschitz continuous, and (3.12)\nl\u03b4 := inf\n{\n`(t, s) : \u03b4 \u2264 s \u2264 \u03b4\u22121, t \u2208 [0, T ]\n}\n> 0 for every \u03b4 > 0 .\n93.1 Optimality of continuous portfolios\nIn this subsection, we will first prove the optimality of continuous portfolio processes.\nIntuitively, it is clear that in an illiquid market it is better to make consecutive small\ntrades instead of a large one. Then taking this idea to the limit, we formally see that\njumps in the portfolio are not optimal. The following result proves this intuition. From\nthe technical viewpoint, let us stress that the relaxation on the processes \u03b1 and a\nplays a crucial role for the next result so that our definition of the set of admissible\nstrategies allows to preclude jumps from optimal strategies, thus agreeing with the\neconomic intuition.\nProposition 1 Assume (3.10), (3.11) and (3.12). Then, V cont = V .\nProof. Fix (t, s) in [0, T ) \u00d7 (0,\u221e). The inequality V cont(t, s) \u2265 V (t, s) is obvious as\nAcontt,s \u2282 At,s. To prove the reverse inequality, let z > V (t, s) and Y \u2208 At,s be such\nthat Z(T ) \u2265 g (S(T )) a.s.. We denote by \u03c41, . . . , \u03c4N the jump times of the portfolio\nprocess Y . From the definition of admissible strategies, recall that \u2016N\u2016\u221e <\u221e.\nLet \u03b5 > 0 be given. We first start by eliminating the final jump at time \u03c4N . Notice\nthat ZYt,z(T ) = Z\nY\n\u03c4N ,Z\u03c4N\n(T ) \u2265 g(S(T )) a.s.. Then, with zN := z + \u03b5, it follows from\nLemmas 5.2 and 5.4 in [33] that ZYNt,zN (T ) \u2265 g(S(T )) a.s., for some YN \u2208 At,s with\nYN = Y on [t, \u03c4N ) and (YN , \u0393N ) is continuous on (\u03c4N\u22121, T ].\nRepeating the above procedure backward, we may eliminate all the jumps. Hence,\nwith z0 := z + \u03b5\u2016N\u2016\u221e, there exists Y0 \u2208 Acontt,s such that Y t,z0,Y0(T ) \u2265 g(S(T )) a.s..\nHence, z0 \u2265 V cont(t, s). Since \u03b5 > 0 and z > V (t, s) are arbitrary, we conclude that\nV (t, s) \u2265 V cont(t, s). 2\nWe close this subsection by discussing the initial and final liquidation costs.\nRemark 1 The previous result on the continuity of the optimal portfolio also proves\nthat there is no initial liquidity cost. Indeed, suppose we start with a portfolio value\ndifferent than the optimal one. Then by shifting the initial wealth by \u000f, we can use the\nProposition 5.1 of [31]. This shows that we can construct a super-replicating portfolio\nwith an arbitrary initial position in the risky asset as long as the initial wealth in the\nbank account is epsilon larger.\nThe situation at the final time is different. At maturity, we are forced to liquidate.\nThis results in a liquidation cost. We chose to ignore this in our analysis. Including\nthis cost will make the liquidity premium even larger. Hence this assumption does not\naffect the chief result of this paper; namely the existence of a liquidity cost. On the\nother hand, this final liquidity cost can be driven to zero, if a nonzero amount of time\nis given for liquidation.\nThe liquidity premium that we prove to exist, however, is due to continuous time\ntrading. Moreover, this premium can not be avoided by spreading our trades over time.\nThis is the motivation behind ignoring the final liquidity cost.\n3.2 The dynamic programming equation characterization\nIn this subsection, we prove the viscosity property of the minimal super-replication\ncost. Let V and V cont be as in (2.8) and (2.9).\n10\nTheorem 1 Assume (3.10), (3.11), (3.12) and that the payoff function g is contin-\nuous. Then, V = V cont is the unique continuous viscosity solution of the dynamic\nprogramming equation\n\u2212Vt + H\u02c6 (t, s, Vss) := sup\n\u03b2\u22650\n(\n\u2212Vt \u2212 1\n2\ns2\u03c32(Vss + \u03b2)\u2212 s\n2\u03c32\n4`\n(Vss + \u03b2)\n2\n)\n= 0(3.13)\non [0, T )\u00d7(0,\u221e), satisfying the terminal condition V (T, .) = g and the growth condition\n\u2212C \u2264 V (t, s) \u2264 C(1 + s), (t, s) \u2208 [0, T ]\u00d7 R+, for some constant C > 0 . (3.14)\nThe proof of this theorem is completed in several steps. The viscosity property\nof the value function and the terminal data follows from a general result proved in\nTheorem 3.2 of the paper [33]. The growth condition (3.14) is derived in Section 5.\nFinally, the uniqueness result follows from the comparison result of Section 6.\nWe close this subsection by several observations on the structure of the equation\n(3.13). First, observe that the dynamic programming equation (3.13) is parabolic, i.e.\nnon-increasing in Vss, as all dynamic programming equations should be. Moreover, the\ndifferential operator appearing on the left-hand side of (3.13) is the parabolic envelope\nof the first guess operator\n\u2212Vt +H (t, s, Vss) := \u2212Vt \u2212 1\n2\ns2\u03c32Vss \u2212 s\n2\u03c32\n4`\nV 2ss .\nWe refer to [7] for more details on the construction of parabolic majorants H\u02c6 of H.\nFinally, by direct manipulation, we see that the maximizer in the dynamic pro-\ngramming equation (3.13) is given by\n\u03b2\u02c6(t, s) := (Vss(t, s) + `(t, s))\n\u2212 , (3.15)\nso that we can rewrite the dynamic programming equation as (1.1).\n3.3 Liquidity premium\nLet VBS be the Black-Scholes price of the claim g. Clearly, V \u2265 VBS and the liquidity\npremium is the difference. Our next result states that liquidity premium is zero only\nfor affine pay-offs.\nCorollary 1 Assume that the hypothesis of the previous theorem hold. Then, V = VBS\nif and only if g is an affine function. Hence the liquidity premium is non-zero for all\nnon-trivial claims.\nProof. By definition of H\u02c6, it is easily seen that\n\u2212Vt \u2212H\n(\nt, s, Vss + \u03b2\u02c6\n)\n= 0\nwhere \u03b2\u02c6 \u2265 0 is given by (3.15). If V = V BS , then V is smooth and is a classical solution\nboth of the above equation and the Black-Scholes equation. This immediately implies\nthat \u03b2\u02c6 = Vss = 0. Then g is affine. The reverse implication is trivial by verifying that\naffine functions satisfies the PDE of V . 2\n11\n4 Formal description of an optimal hedging strategy\nWe now provide a formal description of an optimal hedging strategy for a payoff g(ST )\nunder liquidity costs. An illustrative example is studied in the Appendix 7.2. The\nanalysis of this section will be restricted to a formal discussion as we will ignore some\nadmissibility restrictions and regularity conditions.\nFor concreteness we work in the context of the classical Black-Scholes model, i.e.\n\u03c3(t, s) \u2261 \u03c3, for some positive constant \u03c3. This would also enable us to compare our\nresults with the classical Black-Scholes formula. We also assume that ` is independent\nof the t-variable.\n4.1 Usual hedge\nWhen the minimal super-replication cost V is a classical solution of (3.13) and if\nH\u02c6(t, s, Vss(t, s)) = H(t, s, Vss(t, s)) for all (t, s), then the usual hedge is replicating.\nWe first state and prove this result. Then, in the Appendix, we provide sufficient\nconditions on `.\nFirst recall that H\u02c6(t, s, Vss(t, s)) = H(t, s, Vss(t, s)) if and only if Vss(t, s) \u2265\n\u2212`(t, s). This condition is equivalent to the convexity of\nV\u02c6 (t, s) := V (t, s) +\n\u222b s\n1\n\u222b s\u2032\n1\n`(t, s\u2032\u2032) ds\u2032\u2032ds\u2032.\nTheorem 2 Let V be the value function. Assume that V\u02c6 defined above is convex.\nThen, V is smooth and it is a classical solution of (3.13). Moreover, the classical hedge\nY (u) = Vs(u, S(u)) is replicating.\nProof. We know that V is a viscosity solution of (3.13). Moreover, the convexity of\nV\u02c6 defined above implies that optimizer \u03b2 in (3.13) is zero and that (3.13) is locally\nuniformly elliptic with a convex nonlinearity. Then, one can use the celebrated regu-\nlarity result of Evans [15] and Krylov & Safanov [23,24] to conclude that V is smooth.\nTherefore, it is a classical solution of (3.13). Since (3.13) is a parabolic equation in one\nspace dimension, one can prove this regularity result directly without referring to the\ndeep regularity theory of Evans & Krylov. Indeed, a fixed point argument using the\nresults and the techniques from the classic textbook of Ladyzhenskaya, Solonnikov and\nUralceva [25] also yields this regularity.\nMoreover,\nVss(t, s) > \u2212`(t, s), \u2200 (t, s) (4.16)\nand (3.13) holds with H\u02c6(t, s, Vss(t, s)) = H(t, s, Vss(t, s)). Then, by a standard appli-\ncation of the Ito calculus, we can show that the classical hedge Y (u) = Vs(u, S(u)) is\nreplicating. 2\nIn the Appendix 7.1, we discuss two sufficient conditions for (4.16).\n12\n4.2 Buy-and-hold versus dynamic hedging\nIn this subsection, we discuss the general structure of the hedge. An illustrative example\nwith g(s) = s \u2227 1 will later be discussed in subsection 7.2. To simplify the discussion,\nwe assume that we the supply function is of the following form:\nS (s, \u03bd) := se\u03b1s\u03bd\/4 so that `(s) =\n1\n\u03b1s2\n,\nSet\n\u03c6(t, s) :=\n1\n4\u03b1\n[\n\u03c32(t\u2212 T ) + 4 ln s\n]\n, (t, s) \u2208 [0, T ]\u00d7 R+ , (4.17)\nso that \u03c6ss + ` = 0.\nBefore turning to the description of a hedging strategy in the context of our financial\nmarket with liquidity costs, we would like to discuss the asymmetry between concavity\nand convexity from the point of view of superhedging. This will turn out to be the\ndriving intuition for our hedging strategy.\nThe Black-Scholes hedging theory in a complete market says that the optimal\nsuperhedging strategy of some contingent claim is in fact a perfect replicating strategy,\nand consists in the dynamic strategy of holding at each time r, the number \u2202V\u2202s (r, Sr)\nof shares of the underlying risky asset. In our context, this strategy is more expensive\nthan in the frictionless Black-Scholes model since it induces a non-zero gamma process,\nimplying a penalization on the wealth process.\nA buy-and-hold strategy on some time interval [t, \u03c4) is defined by Y (r) = Y (t) for\nevery r \u2208 [t, \u03c4). In particular, \u0393 = 0 on [t, \u03c4), the wealth process is not subject to\nthe liquidity cost penalty, and it is given by the same expression as in the classical\nfrictionless framework:\nZ(r) = Z(t) + Y (t) (S(r)\u2212 S(t)) for r \u2208 [t, \u03c4) .\nFor a concave payoff, a trivial static superhedging strategy is available. Indeed, per-\nforming the buy-and-hold strategy Y (t) = \u2202g\u2202s (S(t)) on [t, \u03c4) (for a non-smooth g, let\nYt be a measurable selection in the supergradient of g at S(t)), and starting from the\ncapital Zt = g(S(t)), it follows from the concavity of the payoff function g that\nZ(\u03c4) = Z(t) + Y (t) (S(\u03c4)\u2212 S(t)) \u2265 g (S(\u03c4)) .\nThis discussion shows that, in our context of financial market with liquidity costs, when\nthe super-replication value is concave, there is a trade-off between\n- paying a higher cost for a buy-and-hold strategy, thus avoiding the liquidity costs,\n- performing the Black-Scholes replicating strategy but paying the liquidity costs.\nThe hedging strategy which will be described in the next subsection provides a\nprecise definition of the level of concavity below which the liquidity cost induced by\na perfect hedging strategy is so significant that it is cheaper to use a buy-and-hold\nstrategy. In the subsequent subsection we answer the question how a risk manager\nprefers a Black-Scholes type replicating strategy over a buy-and-hold strategy by split-\nting the value of the option into two parts and replicating one part by the classical\nBlack-Scholes hedge while hedging the other part by a combination of a buy-and-hold-\nstrategy together with a classical hedge. The latter is achieved by optimally separating\nthe state space into regions in which one or the other strategy is optimal.\n13\n4.3 Hedging under liquidity costs\nIn order to discuss the hedging strategy, we introduce the following open set:\nC := {(t, s) \u2208 [0, T )\u00d7 (0,\u221e) : Vss(t, s) < \u2212`(t, s)} .\nObserve that on C, (1.1) reduces to\n\u2212Vt + 1\n4\ns2\u03c32(t, s)`(s) = 0 . (4.18)\nNote that (V \u2212 \u03c6)ss < 0 and (V \u2212 \u03c6)t = 0 on C. This implies that (V \u2212 \u03c6)tt =\n(V \u2212 \u03c6)ts = 0 on C. Hence\n(t, s) 7\u2212\u2192 (V \u2212 \u03c6)(t, s) is concave and (V \u2212 \u03c6)t = 0 on C . (4.19)\nGiven an arbitrary initial position (t, s) \u2208 C, we define the exit time\n\u03b8 := inf{u > t : (u, S(u)) 6\u2208 C} .\nWe now consider the initial capital V (t, s) at time t, together with the hedging strategy\n{Y (u), t \u2264 u < \u03b8} defined by\nY (t) := Vs(t, s), \u0393 (u) := \u03c6ss(u, S(u)), and \u03b1(u) := L\u03c6s(u, S(u)) .\nIn words, this hedging strategy consists in dynamically replicating the value function\n\u03c6, and performing a buy-and-hold strategy in order to super-hedge the remaining value\n(V \u2212 \u03c6). Then, we directly calculate for \u03c4 \u2208 (t, \u03b8) that:\nZ(\u03c4) = V (t, s) +\n\u222b \u03c4\nt\nY (u)dS(u)\u2212 1\n4\n\u222b \u03c4\nt\n`\u22121(S(u))\u0393 2(u)\u03c32(u, S(u))S2(u)du\n= V (t, s) + Vs(t, s)(S(\u03c4)\u2212 s) +\n\u222b \u03c4\nt\n(\u222b u\nt\nL\u03c6s(r, S(r))dr + \u03c6ss(r, S(r))dS(r)\n)\ndS(u)\n\u22121\n4\n\u222b \u03c4\nt\n`(u, S(u))\u03c32S2(u)du\n= (V \u2212 \u03c6)(t, s) + (V \u2212 \u03c6)s(t, s)[S(\u03c4)\u2212 s] + \u03c6 (\u03c4, S(\u03c4))\n\u2212\n\u222b \u03c4\nt\n(\nL\u03c6(u, S(u)) + 1\n4\n`(u, S(u))\u03c32(u, S(u))S2(u)\n)\ndu ,\nwhere we applied Ito\u02c6\u2019s lemma twice to the process \u03c6(u, S(u)). We next observe that\nL\u03c6 = \u03c6t + 1\n2\n\u03c32s2\u03c6ss = \u22121\n4\n`(t, s)\u03c32s2 on C .\nTogether with (4.19), this implies that\nZ(\u03c4) = (V \u2212 \u03c6)(t, s) + (V \u2212 \u03c6)s(t, s)[S(\u03c4)\u2212 s] + \u03c6 (\u03c4, S(\u03c4))\n\u2265 (V \u2212 \u03c6) (\u03c4, S(\u03c4)) + \u03c6 (\u03c4, S(\u03c4)) = V (\u03c4, S(\u03c4)) .\nThis shows that the above defined strategy is a super-hedging strategy in C. Outside\nC, one can show by Ito\u02c6\u2019s lemma that the hedging strategy consists in performing a\nperfect replicating Black-Scholes strategy on the total value function V , i.e. Y (u) =\nVs(u, S(u)).\nIn conclusion, the super-hedging strategy in our financial market with liquidity\ncosts is formally described by applying successively a perfect dynamic replicating Black-\nScholes strategy outside C and the above mixed strategy in C which consists in dynam-\nically hedging \u03c6 and super-hedging the difference (V \u2212 \u03c6) by means of a buy-and-hold\nstrategy .\n14\n5 Growth condition\nIn this section, we prove that the growth condition (3.10) placed on the pay-off g\nimplies a similar growth condition on the minimal super-replication prices, v\u02dc and v.\nProposition 2 Assume (3.10). Then, there is a constant C so that\n\u2212C \u2264 V (t, s) \u2264 C[1 + s], \u2200 t \u2208 [0, T ], s \u2265 0. (5.20)\nProof. Let \u2212C be a lower bound for g. Fix any initial point (t, s), and let Y be a super-\nreplicating portfolio. Since the corresponding wealth process ZY is a supermartingale,\nwe have the following inequalities\nZ(t) \u2265 E[Z(T ) | Ft] \u2265 E[g(St,s(T )) | Ft] \u2265 \u2212C.\nHence we have the lower bound.\nTo derive the upper bound, we use the bound g(s) \u2264 C(1 + s), s > 0, for some\nC > 0, of (3.10). Since V (T, s) = g(s), it only remains to derive this upper bound for\nt < T . Consider the buy-and-hold strategy consisting in holding an amount C on the\nbank and C shares of the risky asset until the maturity T , i.e. Y (u) = C. Clearly, ZY\nis super-replicating. Notice that this buy-and-hold strategy induces a liquidity cost at\nthe initial time t. As in Proposition 1, this liquidity cost can be avoided within our\nset of admissible strategies, see also Remark 1. Hence, for every \u03b5 > 0, one can find a\nsuper-replicating strategy with initial cost \u03b5+C(1+s), and therefore V (t, s) \u2264 C(1+s)\nfor every t \u2208 [0, T ). 2\n6 Uniqueness\nTo complete the proof of the main Theorem 1, we need to prove a comparison result\nfor (3.13). Due to the quadratic nonlinearity in (3.13), standard results do not directly\napply to this equation. Moreover, due to the lack of homogeneity in the s-variable, the\ntechniques used in [2] do not apply either. However, we use the special structure of the\nequation coming from the fact that it is one dimensional, and consider the following\nequivalent equation.\n\u2212 A(t, s) Vt + F (t, s, Vss) = 0, (6.21)\nwhere\nA(t, s) :=\n4`(t, s)\ns2\u03c32(t, s)\n, F (t, s, Vss) :=\n[\n`2(t, s)\u2212\n(\n(Vss + `(t, s))\n+\n)2]\n. (6.22)\nProposition 3 Let Condition (3.11) and (3.12) hold, and let w\u02dc be a lower semi-\ncontinuous supersolution of (6.21) and w be an upper semi-continuous subsolution of\n(6.21). Further assume that w\u02dc and w satisfy the growth condition (5.20) and the bound-\nary conditions\nw(T, s) \u2264 w\u02dc(T, s), \u2200 s \u2265 0, (6.23)\nw(t, 0) \u2264 w\u02dc(t, 0), \u2200 t \u2208 [0, T ]. (6.24)\nThen, w \u2264 w\u02dc on [0, T ]\u00d7 R+.\n15\nProof.\n1. Set\n\u03c8(t, s) := w(t, s)\u2212 w\u02dc(t, s).\nThe goal is to show that \u03c8 \u2264 0 on [0, T ]\u00d7R+. We suppose to the contrary and assume\nthat there exists (t0, s0) \u2208 [0, T ] \u00d7 R+ such that \u03c8(t0, s0) > 0. Since \u03c8 \u2264 0 on the\nparabolic boundary\n({T} \u00d7 R+) \u222a ([0, T ]\u00d7 {0}) and \u03c8 is upper semi-continuous, it is\nclear that t0 < T and s0 > 0. Moreover, again by the upper semi-continuity, for any\ncompact subset K \u2282 [0, T ]\u00d7 R+ containing (t0, s0) there exists \u03b4 > 0 so that we have\nsup\nK\n\u03c8 = sup\nN\u2229K\n\u03c8 where N := [0, T \u2212 2\u03b4]\u00d7 [2\u03b4, \u03b4\u22121) .\n2. Following the usual trick in the theory of viscosity solutions [10], we construct a\nstrict super-solution to (6.21). In view of the previous step, we only need this property\non the domain N .\nFor \u03b3 \u2265 1, we set\n\u03b7(t, s) := [s ln(s) + \u03b3] (T \u2212 t+ 1).\nso that, for (t, s) \u2208 N\nI[\u03b7](t, s) := \u2212A(s)\u03b7t(t, s) + F (s, \u03b7ss(t, s))\n= A(s)[s ln(s) + \u03b3]\u2212 (T \u2212 t+ 1)\n2\ns2\n\u2212 2`(s)(T \u2212 t+ 1)\ns\n=\n1\ns2\n(\n4`(s)\n\u03c32(t, s)\n[s ln(s) + \u03b3]\u2212 (T \u2212 t+ 1)2 \u2212 2s`(s)(T \u2212 t+ 1)\n)\n=\n1\ns2\n(\n4`(s)\n\u03c32(t, s)\n[s ln(s) + \u03b3]\u2212 c\u2212 cs`(s)\n)\n\u2265 `(s)\ns2\u03c32(t, s)\n(\n[2\u03b3 \u2212 \u03c3\n2(t, s)\n`(s)\nc] + [4s ln(s) + 2\u03b3 \u2212 c\u03c32(t, s)s]\n)\n.\nBy conditions (3.11) and (3.12),\nsup\nN\n{\n\u03c32(t, s)\n`(s)\n+ \u03c32(t, s)\n}\n<\u221e.\nHence, there is \u03b3 \u2265 1 so that\nc[\u03b7] := inf\nN\nI[\u03b7] > 0.\nLet C be the constant in (5.20). We can choose \u03b3 \u2265 1 so that in addition to above\ninequality, we also have\n\u03b7(t, s) \u2265 C[1 + s] \u2265 max{ w(t, s) ; w\u02dc(t, s) }. (6.25)\n3. For \u00b5 \u2208 [0, 1] set\nw\u00b5 := (1\u2212 \u00b5) w\u02dc + \u00b5 \u03b7.\nLet I[\u00b7] be defined as in the previous step. Then, by the concavity of F , on N ,\nI[w\u00b5] \u2265 (1\u2212 \u00b5) I[w\u02dc] + \u00b5 I[\u03b7] \u2265 \u00b5 c[\u03b7].\nHence, w\u00b5 is a strict super-solution of (6.21) on N .\n16\n4. Set\n\u03c8\u00b5(t, s) := w(t, s)\u2212 w\u00b5(t, s).\nIn step 1, we assumed that \u03c8(t0, s0) > 0. Hence for \u00b5 sufficiently small we also have\n\u03c8\u00b5(t0, s0) > 0. In view of (6.24), (6.23) and (6.25), \u03c8\n\u00b5 \u2264 0 on the parabolic boundary\n({T} \u00d7 R+)(\u222a[0, T ] \u00d7 {0}). Also for all \u00b5 > 0, the growth of \u03b7 is faster than linear\nand by (5.20) and step 1, we conclude that \u03c8\u00b5 attains its maximum at some point\n(t\u00b5, s\u00b5) \u2208 [0, T \u2212 2\u03b4]\u00d7 [2\u03b4, (2\u03b4)\u22121) \u2282 N :\n\u03c8\u00b5(t\u00b5, s\u00b5) = sup\nN\n\u03c8\u00b5 = sup\n[0,T ]\u00d7[0,\u221e)\n\u03c8\u00b5.\nFix \u00b5 > 0 satisfying above.\n5. Let \u00b5 be as above and for \u03b1 > 0, consider the auxiliary function\n\u03a6\u03b1,\u00b5(t, s; t\u00af, s\u00af) := w(t, s)\u2212 w\u00b5(t\u00af, s\u00af)\u2212 \u03b1\n2\n[|t\u2212 t\u00af|2 + |s\u2212 s\u00af|2].\nIn view of the previous step, for all small \u00b5 > 0 and sufficiently large \u03b1 \u2265 1, there is a\nmaximizer (t\u03b1,\u00b5, s\u03b1,\u00b5, t\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5, s\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5) of \u03a6\u03b1,\u00b5. Moreover, as \u03b1 tends to infinity, (t\u03b1,\u00b5, s\u03b1,\u00b5, t\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5, s\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5)\napproaches to (t\u00b5, s\u00b5, t\u00b5, s\u00b5). Since (t\u00b5, s\u00b5) \u2208 [0, T\u22122\u03b4]\u00d7[2\u03b4, (2\u03b4)\u22121) \u2282 N , for all large\n\u03b1, (t\u03b1,\u00b5, s\u03b1,\u00b5, t\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5, s\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5) \u2208 N \u00d7N .\nAlso,\nlim\n\u03b1\u2192\u221e \u03b1 [|t\n\u03b1,\u00b5\u2212 t\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5|2+|s\u03b1,\u00b5\u2212s\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5|2] = 0, c\u00b5 := sup\n\u03b1>1\n[|s\u03b1,\u00b5|+|s\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5|] <\u221e. (6.26)\n6. By the Crandall-Ishii Lemma (see [10] or Section V.6 in [16]), there are a\u03b1,\u00b5 \u2264 b\u03b1,\u00b5\nsuch that\n(q\u03b1, p\u03b1, a\u03b1,\u00b5) \u2208 D+(1,2)w(t\u03b1,\u00b5, s\u03b1,\u00b5), (q\u03b1, p\u03b1, b\u03b1,\u00b5) \u2208 D\u2212(1,2)w\u00b5(t\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5, s\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5),\nq\u03b1 := \u03b1 [t\u03b1,\u00b5 \u2212 t\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5], p\u03b1 := \u03b1 [s\u03b1,\u00b5 \u2212 s\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5],\nand the sets D\u2212(1,2), D+(1,2) are defined in [10,16]. Formally, q\u03b1 is the generalized\ntime derivative, p\u03b1 is the generalized space derivative and a\u03b1,\u00b5, b\u03b1,\u00b5 are the generalized\nsecond derivatives. We now use the viscosity property of w and w\u00b5 to obtain,\n\u2212A(t\u03b1,\u00b5, s\u03b1,\u00b5)q\u03b1 + F (t\u03b1,\u00b5, s\u03b1,\u00b5, a\u03b1,\u00b5) \u2264 0, (6.27)\n\u2212A(t\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5, s\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5)q\u03b1 + F (t\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5, s\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5, b\u03b1,\u00b5) \u2265 \u00b5c[\u03b7]. (6.28)\nMoreover, as in page 217 in [16], we can show that a\u03b1,\u00b5, b\u03b1,\u00b5 satisfy |a\u03b1,\u00b5|+| \u2264 b\u03b1,\u00b5| \u2264\n\u03b1 and [\na\u03b1,\u00b5 0\n0 \u2212 b\u03b1,\u00b5\n]\n\u2264 3\u03b1\n[\n1 \u22121\n\u22121 1\n]\n. (6.29)\nUsing (6.26), (6.29) and the local Lipschitz property of the coefficients (3.11)-(3.12),\nwe will show in Lemma 1 below that there is a constant C\u00b5 such that\u2223\u2223A(t\u03b1,\u00b5, s\u03b1,\u00b5)\u2212A(t\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5, s\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5)\u2223\u2223 |q\u03b1| \u2264 C\u00b5\u03b1 (|t\u03b1,\u00b5 \u2212 t\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5|2 + |s\u03b1,\u00b5 \u2212 s\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5|2)(6.30)\n\u2212F (t\u03b1,\u00b5, s\u03b1,\u00b5, a\u03b1,\u00b5) + F (t\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5, s\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5, b\u03b1,\u00b5) \u2264 C\u00b5\n(\n\u03b1|t\u03b1,\u00b5 \u2212 t\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5|2 + \u03b1|s\u03b1,\u00b5 \u2212 s\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5|2\n+|t\u03b1,\u00b5 \u2212 t\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5|+ |s\u03b1,\u00b5 \u2212 s\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5|)(6.31)\n17\n7. Subtract (6.27) from (6.28) and then use (6.30). The result is,\n\u00b5 c[\u03b7] \u2264 C\u00b5\u03b1 [|t\u03b1,\u00b5 \u2212 t\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5|2 + |s\u03b1,\u00b5 \u2212 s\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5|2].\nWe let \u03b1 tend to infinity and use (6.26). This implies that \u00b5c[\u03b7] \u2264 0. However, this\ncontradicts the fact that \u00b5 and c[\u03b7] are strictly positive. Hence, there is no (t0, s0) as\nin step 1. Therefore, \u03c8 \u2264 0 on [0, T ]\u00d7 R+. 2\nWe complete the above proof by proving the technical estimate (6.30).\nLemma 1 Assume (3.11)-(3.12), then (6.30) holds for all \u03b1 \u2265 1.\nProof.\n1. In view of (3.11) and (3.12), the coefficient A defined by (6.22) is locally Lipschitz\non N . Since by 6.26 s\u03b1,\u00b5 and s\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5 are uniformly bounded in \u03b1, there exists a constant,\nC\u00b5 possibly depending on \u00b5 so that\u2223\u2223A(t\u03b1,\u00b5, s\u03b1,\u00b5)\u2212A(t\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5, s\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5)\u2223\u2223 |q\u03b1| \u2264 C\u00b5 [\u2223\u2223t\u03b1,\u00b5 \u2212 t\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5\u2223\u2223+ \u2223\u2223s\u03b1,\u00b5 \u2212 s\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5\u2223\u2223] |q\u03b1|\n= C\u00b5 \u03b1\n[\u2223\u2223t\u03b1,\u00b5 \u2212 t\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5\u2223\u22232 + \u2223\u2223s\u03b1,\u00b5 \u2212 s\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223t\u03b1,\u00b5 \u2212 t\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5\u2223\u2223]\n\u2264 C\u00b5 \u03b1\n[\u2223\u2223t\u03b1,\u00b5 \u2212 t\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5\u2223\u22232 + \u2223\u2223s\u03b1,\u00b5 \u2212 s\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5\u2223\u22232]\n2. We continue by proving the second inequality in (6.30). To simplify the presentation,\nwe suppress the superscripts in our notation, i.e. s = s\u03b1,\u00b5, a = a\u03b1,\u00b5 etc. By the\ndefinition of F , (6.22),\n\u2212F (t\u03b1,\u00b5, s\u03b1,\u00b5, a\u03b1,\u00b5) + F (t\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5, s\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5, b\u03b1,\u00b5)\n= \u2212F (t, s, a) + F (t\u00af, s\u00af, b)\n= `2(t\u00af, s\u00af)\u2212 `2(t, s) + (a+ `(t, s))+2 \u2212 (b+ `(t\u00af, s\u00af))+2\n= C\u00b5\n(|t\u03b1,\u00b5 \u2212 t\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5||s\u03b1,\u00b5 \u2212 s\u00af\u03b1,\u00b5|)+ (a+ `(t, s))+2 \u2212 (b+ `(t\u00af, s\u00af))+2.\nIf (a+`(t, s))+2\u2212(b+`(t\u00af, s\u00af))+2 \u2264 0, then the proof of the required estimate is complete.\nWe then continue to proof the estimate in the case\n(a+ `(t, s))+2 \u2212 (b+ `(t\u00af, s\u00af))+2 > 0 . (6.32)\nSince the matrix inequality (6.29) implies that a \u2264 b, it follows from the increase of\nthe function z 7\u2212\u2192 z+ that\n(a+ `(t, s))+2 \u2212 (b+ `(t\u00af, s\u00af))+2\n=\n(\n(a+ `(t, s))+ \u2212 (b+ `(t\u00af, s\u00af))+\n) (\n(a+ `(t, s))+ + (b+ `(t\u00af, s\u00af))+\n)\n\u2264\n(\n(a+ `(t, s))+ \u2212 (b+ `(t\u00af, s\u00af))+\n) (\n(b+ `(t, s))+ + (b+ `(t\u00af, s\u00af))+\n)\n\u2264 ((a\u2212 b) + C\u00b5(|s\u2212 s\u00af|+ |t\u2212 t\u00af|)) (|b|+ C\u00b5)\n3. We will now use again the restriction (6.29) to estimate the right hand side of the\nfinal inequality in step 2. We already know that (6.29) implies that a \u2264 b, but it is\nstronger than that. Indeed, multiply (6.29) by a general two vector (x, y) both from\nright and left. The result is,\nax2 \u2212 by2 \u2264 3\u03b1(x\u2212 y)2, \u2200 x, y \u2208 R1.\n18\nBy choosing x = y, we obtain a \u2264 b. But this choice may not be optimal and by\ncalculus we conclude that\na\u2212 b \u2264 \u2212 b\n2\n3\u03b1+ b\n.\n4. Observe that the above estimates implies that b\n2\n3\u03b1+b \u2265 C\u00b5(|t\u2212 t\u00af|+|s\u2212 s\u00af|) contradicts\n(6.32). Hence b\n2\n3\u03b1+b \u2264 C\u00b5(|t\u2212 t\u00af|+ |s\u2212 s\u00af|). Since |b| \u2264 \u03b1, this implies that\nb2 \u2264 C\u00b5\u03b1 (|t\u2212 t\u00af|+ |s\u2212 s\u00af|).\nwith a possibly different constant denoted by C\u00b5 again. We substitute this into the\nestimate of step 2. The result is\n(a+ `(t, s))+2 \u2212 (b+ `(t\u00af, s\u00af))+2\n\u2264 C\u00b5(|t\u2212 t\u00af|+ |s\u2212 s\u00af|) (|b|+ C\u00b5)\n\u2264 C\u00b5(|t\u2212 t\u00af|+ |s\u2212 s\u00af|) + C\u00b5|b| (|t\u2212 t\u00af|+ |s\u2212 s\u00af|)\n\u2264 C\u00b5(|t\u2212 t\u00af|+ |s\u2212 s\u00af|) + C\u00b5\n[\n|b|2 + 1\n]\n(|t\u2212 t\u00af|+ |s\u2212 s\u00af|)\n\u2264 C\u00b5(|t\u2212 t\u00af|+ |s\u2212 s\u00af|) + C\u00b5 [C\u00b5\u03b1 (|t\u2212 t\u00af|+ |s\u2212 s\u00af|) + 1] (|t\u2212 t\u00af|+ |s\u2212 s\u00af|)\n\u2264 C\u00b5\n(\n|t\u2212 t\u00af|+ |s\u2212 s\u00af|+ \u03b1 |s\u2212 s\u00af|2 + \u03b1 |t\u2212 t\u00af|2\n)\n.\n2\n7 Appendix\n7.1 Sufficient Conditions for (4.16)\nIn the following two remarks, we state conditions that imply (4.16). Set\nL(s) := s\n\u221a\n`(s).\nOur arguments below require polynomial type growth conditions on the functions re-\nlated to the second derivative of the value function. Here we avoid these technical\ndiscussions and we simply assume the appropriate growth condition. However, they\ncould be easily verified in all interesting examples.\nRemark 2 Set\nh(t, s) :=\ns\u03c3\n2\n\u221a\n`(s)\nVss(t, s).\nSuppose that s2Lss\/L is bounded from above, the claim g is convex and h is polyno-\nmially growing. Then, the minimal super-replicating cost V is convex. In particular,\n(4.16) holds.\nSince g is convex, (4.16) holds on an open set including {T}\u00d7[0,\u221e). On this subset,\n0 = \u2212Vt \u2212 \u03c3\n2s2\n4`(s)\n(Vss)\n2 \u2212 \u03c3\n2s2\n2\nVss. (7.33)\n19\nThen,\n0 = \u2212Vt \u2212 h2(t, s)\u2212 \u03c3L(s)h.\nBy a direct calculation,\n0 = \u2212ht \u2212 s\u03c3\n2\n\u221a\n`(s)\n(h2)ss \u2212 s\u03c3\n2\n2\n\u221a\n`(s)\n(Lh)ss\n= \u2212ht \u2212 s\u03c3\u221a\n`(s)\n[\nhhss + (hs)\n2\n]\n\u2212 s\u03c3\n2\n2\n\u221a\n`(s)\n[Lhss + Lshs + Lssh]\n= \u2212ht \u2212 s\u03c3\n2\n\u221a\n`(s)\n[Vss + `]hss \u2212 a(t, s) hs + b(t, s) h,\nwhere\na(t, s) =\ns\u03c3\n2\n\u221a\n`(s)\n[2hs + \u03c3Ls] , b(s) := \u2212 s\u03c3\n2\n2\n\u221a\n`(s)\nLss = \u2212\u03c3\n2\n2\ns2Lss(s)\nL(s)\n.\nWe assume that h(T, \u00b7) \u2265 0 and b(s) is bounded from below. Hence, by the Feynman-\nKac representation of linear equations (or equivalently by the classical maximum prin-\nciple), we conclude that h is non-negative. Hence, the value function is convex on the\nopen set (7.33) holds. By iterating the procedure, we conclude that this open set is the\nwhole space and V is convex. 2\nRemark 3 Set\nH(t, s) :=\ns\u03c3\n2\n\u221a\n`(s)\n[Vss(t, s) + `(s)] .\nSuppose that L2(s) = s2`(s) is concave, the claim gss(s) \u2265 \u2212`(t, s) and H is polyno-\nmially growing. Then, the minimal super-replicating cost V satisfies (4.16).\nAgain (7.33) holds on an open set including {T} \u00d7 [0,\u221e). We rewrite it as\n0 = \u2212Vt + \u03c3\n2L2(s)\n4\n\u2212 \u03c3\n2s2\n4`(s)\n(Vss + `(s))\n2.\nThen,\n0 = \u2212Ht \u2212 s\u03c3\n2\n\u221a\n`(s)\n[\nH2 \u2212 \u03c3\n2L2\n4\n]\nss\n= \u2212Ht \u2212 s\u03c3\n2\n\u221a\n`(s)\n[\n2HHss + 2(Hs)\n2 \u2212 \u03c3\n2\n4\n(L2)ss\n]\n\u2264 \u2212Ht \u2212 s\u03c3\n2\n\u221a\n`(s)\n[\n2HHss + 2(Hs)\n2\n]\n.\nAgain, we conclude by using the maximum principle or equivalently the Feynman-Kac\nrepresentation. 2\n20\n7.2 An Example\nIn this subsection, we provide a simple example in which the buy-and-hold regime\nis non-empty. Since Theorem 2 and Remark 2 imply that for convex terminal data\nhedging is classical, we study the simplest concave pay-off: namely,\ng(s) := s \u2227 1,\nwith supply curve as in the previous section, i.e.,\n`(s) = 1\/(\u03b1s2), \u03c6(t, s) =\n1\n4\u03b1\n[\n\u03c32(t\u2212 T ) + 4 ln s\n]\n.\nFor brevity, we will not provide all technical details of the subsequent arguments.\nHowever, we believe that these arguments can be turned into a rigorous proof with\nsome care.\nSince the claim g has a concave discontinuity at s = 1 and the equation (3.13) is\ndegenerate for sufficiently negative second derivatives, we expect that the value function\ninherits this property on some interval (t\u2217, T ]. Then, (t, 1) \u2208 C for t \u2208 (t\u2217, T ). Since on\nC (1.1) has the form (4.18), a direct calculation implies that\nV (t, 1) = 1 + \u03c6(t, 1), \u2200 t \u2208 [t\u2217, T ].\nWe continue by constructing the value function using this additional boundary\ncondition. We also use the intuition that C = (t\u2217, T ) \u00d7 {1}. Indeed, let t\u2217 < T to be\nchosen below and v+ be the solution of dynamic programming equation (3.13) on the\ndomain (t\u2217, T )\u00d7 (1,\u221e) with boundary condition\nv+(T, s) = g(s) = 1, s \u2265 1, and v+(t, 1) = V (t, 1) = 1 + \u03c6(t, 1), t > t\u2217.\nObserve that the boundary condition at s = 1 formally implies that v+ss(t, 1) = \u2212`(1).\nThis together with the terminal condition and the arguments of Remark 3 imply that\nv+ss(t, s) \u2265 \u2212`(s) and v+ is smooth. Similarly, we define v\u2212 as the solution of (3.13)\non the domain (t\u2217, T )\u00d7 (0, 1) with boundary condition\nv\u2212(T, s) = g(s) = s, s \u2264 1, and v\u2212(t, 1) = V (t, 1) = 1 + \u03c6(t, 1), t > t\u2217.\nThe same argument implies that v\u2212ss(t, s) \u2265 \u2212`(s) as well. Set\nv+s (1\n+, t) := lim\ns\u21931\nv+s (s, t), v\n\u2212\ns (1\n\u2212, t) := lim\ns\u21911\nv\u2212s (s, t).\nObserve that v+s (1\n+, T ) = 0 and v\u2212s (1+, T ) = 1. Let t\u2217 be the smallest time point such\nthat\nv+s (1\n+, t) < v\u2212s (1\u2212, t), \u2200 t \u2208 (t\u2217, T ].\nWe formally expect that t\u2217 < T . Then,\nV\u00af (t, s) := v+(t, s)1{s\u22651} + v\n\u2212(t, s)1{s\u22641},\nhas a concave first order discontinuity at s = 1. Using this fact, one may directly show\nthat V\u00af is a viscosity solution of (3.13) on (t\u2217, T )\u00d7 (0,\u221e), although it is discontinuous\nat s = 1. Then, by the comparison result for (3.13), V\u00af is equal to the value function\nV on this region. For t < t\u2217, the value function satisfies the condition (4.16) and it is\na smooth solution.\n21\nGiven the above structure of the value function, we can construct a hedge along the\nlines described in the previous section. However, in this example C = (t\u2217, T )\u00d7{1} and\nthis simplifies the construction. Indeed, with an initial point t0 > t\n\u2217, s0 = 1, choose\n\u03b4 \u2208 (v+s (1+, t0), v\u2212s (1\u2212, t0)). Set\n\u03c8(t, s) := 1+(\u03b4\u2212\u03c6s(t, 1))(s\u22121)+\u03c6(t, s) = 1+(\u03b4\u22121\/\u03b1)(s\u22121)+ 1\n4\u03b1\n[\n\u03c32(t\u2212 T ) + 4 ln s\n]\n,\nso that \u03c8 solves the equation (7.33) and equivalently (3.13). Moreover, for each t \u2265 t0\nset\nL(t) := max\n{\ns > 1 : \u03c8s(t, s\n\u2032) \u2265 v+s (t, s\u2032)), \u2200 s\u2032 \u2208 (1, s)\n}\n,\nR(t) := min\n{\ns > 1 : \u03c8s(t, s\n\u2032) \u2264 v\u2212s (t, s\u2032)), \u2200 s\u2032 \u2208 (s, 1)\n}\n.\nNow define the hedge by Y (u) = \u03c8s(u, S(u)), until the exit time \u03c41 of the process\n(u, S(u)) from the domain (R(t), L(t)).\nIt is clear that Y (\u03c41) = Vs(\u03c41, S(\u03c41)) and by the calculations of subsection 4.2,\nZ(\u03c41) = \u03c8(\u03c41, S(\u03c41)) > V (\u03c41, S(\u03c41)).\nAfter the exit time \u03c41, we set Y (u) := Vs(u, S(u)) until the next stopping time S(\u03c42) =\n1.\nWe would like to continue this process. For that we need Y (\u03c42) to be strictly in the\ninterval (v+s (1\n+, \u03c42), v\n\u2212\ns (1\n\u2212, \u03c42)) but in fact Y (\u03c42) is equal to one of the end points.\nHowever,\nZ(\u03c42)\u2212 V (\u03c42, S(\u03c42)) = Z(\u03c41)\u2212 V (\u03c41, S(\u03c41)) > Z(t0)\u2212 V (t0, 1) = 0,\nMoreover, by the results of [33] (see also Remark 1), we may change the portfolio value\nY (\u03c42) to any value (in particular, to a point in the interval (v\n+\ns (1\n+, \u03c42), v\n\u2212\ns (1\n\u2212, \u03c42)) )\nwith arbitrarily small cost which can be covered by the gains Z(\u03c42) \u2212 V (\u03c42, S(\u03c42)).\nHence, we may reiterate the process to replicate this particular claim from any initial\ndata (t0, 1). From any other initial data we simply follow the usual hedge until the\nstopping time S(\u03c4) = 1. Then, we use the above procedure.\nAcknowledgements We would like to thank anonymous referees for valuable advice.
