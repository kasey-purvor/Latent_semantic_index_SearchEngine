Problems\nencountered by librarians in producing a specification are compounded by new\ndevelopments in technology. The process of specifying the operational requirements of\na system can be problematic, time consuming and expensive for a library. There is no\nstandard guidance available on the format and content of the specification. The\nprocurement process is also difficult for potential system suppliers who, in order to\nsell a system, must respond to specifications which are very variable in terms of\ncontent, format and quality. The aim of this research, therefore, was to determine the\nfeasibility of developing and disseminating a model system specification which could\nbe used to assist and guide libraries in the procurement of library management\nsystems. Forty-one specifications, collected from libraries which had recently acquired\na library management system, were analysed. The results demonstrate that the\nspecifications included the same broad categories of information and requirements,\nwith the majority specifying requirements for all or most of the core modules\n(Cataloguing, Acquisitions, Circulation, Serials). The functional requirements specified\nfor each of the core modules had strong similarities both within and across the sectors\n(public, academic, special). Some \u2018additional\u2019 (i.e. non-core) features were required\nwithin the sectors. There was wide variation both between and within sectors in the\nformat, organisation, level of detail and terminology used in the specifications. A\nsurvey of UK system suppliers was also undertaken to determine the collective view\nof suppliers on the role, content, quality and usefulness of the specification as a\nprocurement tool. Suppliers expressed frustration with the tendency for specifications\nproduced by librarians to be dominated by lists of functional requirements which were\npresent in all library management systems on the market today. The Report\nconcludes with recommendations for the development of a plain English guide to new\ntechnological developments and their implications for libraries, the development of an\nannual short course for middle managers currently involved in procurement, and the\ndevelopment of a toolkit of basic functions which can be expected in all library\nmanagement systems. A recommendation for further research on common\nrequirements for computer based management of resources in libraries is also made.<\/dc:description><dc:description>Full-text of this article is available at http:\/\/www.cerlim.ac.uk\/projects\/harmonise\/harmonise.pdf<\/dc:description><dc:publisher>Resource: The Council for Museums, Archives and Libraries<\/dc:publisher><dc:date>2009-12-02T14:27:23Z<\/dc:date><dc:type>Article<\/dc:type><dc:identifier>1902394569<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1466-2949<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/2173\/87255<\/dc:identifier><dc:language>en<\/dc:language><dc:relation>http:\/\/www.cerlim.ac.uk\/projects\/harmonise\/harmonise.pdf<\/dc:relation><\/oai_dc:dc><\/metadata><\/record>","journals":null,"language":{"code":"en","id":9,"name":"English"},"relations":["http:\/\/www.cerlim.ac.uk\/projects\/harmonise\/harmonise.pdf"],"year":2009,"topics":[],"subject":["Article"],"fullText":""}
