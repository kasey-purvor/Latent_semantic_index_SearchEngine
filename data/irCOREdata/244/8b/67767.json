Although the concept seems abstract\nand mathematical at first sight, stochastic webs are now known to arise in a number of practical\ncontexts, including for example plasma physics [1], ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices [2\u20134]\nand electrons in semiconductor superlattices (SLs) [5\u201311]; they have also been considered in\nconnection with celestial mechanics [12]. The importance of the chaotic threads is that they\ncan transport matter and energy effectively over long distances [13, 14]. In this brief and rather\ninformal review we aim to introduce the general reader to stochastic webs, explaining what\nthey are and discussing their recent developments and applications, taking electron transport in\nsemiconductor SLs as our example.\nWe start (Section 1.1) from the definition of a Hamiltonian system, its dimensionality and\nintegrability. Then (Section 1.2) we consider the effect of perturbations of the integrable system,\nwhich brings us to the concept of a chaotic (stochastic) layer, in particular related to resonances.\nThe latter allows us to explain in the beginning of Section 2 the onset of the Arnold stochastic\n\u2217Corresponding author.

The main purpose of this section is to discuss the more\nsophisticated nature of low-dimensional stochastic webs which are, however, still related to the\nconcept of resonance. In Section 3, we explain the limitations of the transport though the low-\ndimensional web and suggest a subtle way of overcoming these limitations. Finally, in Section 4,\nwe discuss a rather unexpected application of the stochastic web concept to quantum electron\ntransport in nanometer-scale semiconductor SLs in the presence of electric and magnetic fields.\nSection 5 draws conclusions.\n1.1 Hamiltonian systems\nHamiltonian systems play an important role in physics, chemistry, biology and engineering,\nand form a fundamental class of dynamical systems [15\u201317]. They are defined by the following\ndynamical equations:\ndpi\ndt\n= \u2212\u2202H\n\u2202qi\n,\ndqi\ndt\n=\n\u2202H\n\u2202pi\n. (1)\nIf the Hamiltonian H does not depend on time t, while depending only on the momenta ~p \u2261\n(p1, . . . , pN ) and coordinates ~q \u2261 (q1, . . . , qN ), then it is called N -dimensional. If it also depends\non time t, then it has the dimension N + 12 . A remarkable property of any Hamiltonian system\nis the equality of its full and partial derivatives with respect to time:\ndH\ndt\n=\n\u2202H\n\u2202t\n. (2)\nIn particular, for time-independent Hamiltonians, H(~p, ~q) is conserved along the trajectory.\nIn general, the equations of motion (1) may not be integrable in quadratures1 [15\u201317], whence\nthe importance of integrable systems, i.e. those time-independent Hamiltonian systems for which\na transformation {~p, ~q} \u2194 {~I, ~\u03b8} exists such that\nH(~p, ~q) = H\u02dc(~I). (3)\nIi are called actions while \u03b8i are called angles. It follows from (3) that ~I is conserved:\ndIi\ndt\n= \u2212\u2202H\u02dc\n\u2202\u03b8i\n= 0, (4)\nwhile the angles \u03b8i change with constant speeds (for a given ~I),\nd\u03b8i\ndt\n=\n\u2202H\u02dc(~I)\n\u2202Ii\n\u2261 \u03c9i(~I), (5)\nwhich are called frequencies.\nNote that angles \u03b8i are cyclic variables i.e. ~p and ~q are periodic functions of \u03b8i with a period\n2pi for any \u03b8i [1, 15\u201317]. Thus, Eqs. (4) and (5) correspond to periodic or quasi-periodic motion.\nThe simplest and most often used example of an integrable system is a one-dimensional one,\nwhich will be described in more detail below.\n1When the solution of a differential equation expressible in terms of a formula involving integrations, it is said to be solvable\nby quadrature.\nNovember 6, 2009 11:1 Contemporary Physics CPstochasticwebs\u02d9resub\nStochastic webs and quantum transport 3\nq\np\nFigure 1.

For the majority of cases, the answer is given by the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM)\ntheory [15]: most of the trajectories are just weakly distorted by a weak perturbation while\nremaining regular. Let us illustrate this by an example of a one-dimensional system weakly per-\nturbed time-periodically. In this case, it is convenient to present the trajectory in the stroboscopic\nPoincare\u00b4 section [1, 15\u201317], i.e. presenting states of the system {p(t), q(t)} only at the discrete\nsequence of instants t = tn \u2261 t0 + nT where t0 is some initial instant, T is the perturbation\nperiod and n = 0, 1, 2, .... If the trajectory is \u201cjust weakly distorted while remaining regular\u201d,\nthen, in particular, the unperturbed trajectory and the Poincare\u00b4 section of the perturbed one\nhave the same dimension of 1 (i.e. they are just lines), and the same topology, while just slightly\ndeviating from each other (Fig. 1).\nThere are, however, two kinds of situation for which KAM-theory is not valid. The first of\nthese relates to the separatrices of the unperturbed systems. Let an integrable system possess a\nseparatrix i.e. the line (or surface, or hyper-surface in the general multi-dimensional case) that\nseparates trajectories of a different topology in the phase space1: e.g. in the example shown\nin Fig. 2(a), the separatrix separates closed trajectories (corresponding to oscillations inside\nthe separatrix loops) from open trajectories (corresponding to the running coordinate below or\nabove the separatrix loops). If the system is perturbed time-periodically2, then the separatrix is\nreplaced by a chaotic trajectory. In Poincare\u00b4 section, the chaotic trajectory lies within a chaotic\nlayer (Fig. 2(b)): the latter has a complicated (fractal) structure but its outer boundaries are\nwell defined and the region delineated by these boundaries has the dimension 2, unlike the\n1More rigorously, the separatrices may be defined as follows [18]. Let the integrable system possess a saddle i.e. a hyperbolic\npoint in the one-dimensional case (i.e. an unstable stationary point with an exponential dynamics of trajectories approaching\nit), or a hyperbolic invariant torus in higher-dimensional cases. The stable (incoming) and unstable (outgoing) manifolds\nare called separatrices.\n2In multi-dimensional cases, a time-independent perturbation also may give rise to the invalidity of the KAM-theory near\nthe separatrix.\nNovember 6, 2009 11:1 Contemporary Physics CPstochasticwebs\u02d9resub\n4 Soskin, McClintock, Fromhold, Khovanov & Mannella\nE (energy)\n\u03c9\n \n(ei\nge\nnfr\neq\nue\nnc\ny) \u03c9f\nE\nr\nFigure 3.

Thus, even the appearance of the Poincare\u00b4 section allows us\nto distinguish immediately between regular and chaotic trajectories, unless of course the width of\nthe chaotic layer is less than the accuracy provided by the numerical integration of equations of\nmotion. The theoretical prediction of the width in energy of the chaotic layer has a long and rich\nhistory. Its description on a physics level of rigour may be found in the book by Zaslavsky [17].\nStudies that are more mathematically rigorous have recently been reviewed [19]. The maximum\nwidth of the layer and other significant features (high peaks) of the width as function of the\nperturbation frequency have recently been described [20, 21].\nAnother characteristic situation where the KAM-theory is invalid relates to resonances, i.e. to\nareas of the phase space where at least one of the following conditions holds\nn\u03c9i(~Ir) = m\u03c9j(~Ir), (6)\nn,m = \u00b11,\u00b12,\u00b13, . . . ,\ni, j = 1, 2, 3, . . . , N, i 6= j,\nN = 2, 3, 4, . . . ,\nor\nn\u03c9i(~Ir) = l\u03c9f , (7)\nn = \u00b11,\u00b12,\u00b13, . . . ,\ni = 1, 2, 3, . . . , N \u2212 1\n2\n,\nN =\n3\n2\n,\n5\n2\n,\n7\n2\n, . . . ,\nwhere \u03c9f is the frequency of the corresponding time-periodic perturbation while l is the number\nof the Fourier harmonic that may exist for the time-periodic perturbation (e.g. for a monochro-\nmatic perturbation, only l = 1 is relevant).\nThe rigorous treatment of motion in the resonance range is rather complicated, being related\nto the Poincare\u00b4-Birkhoff theorem and homoclinic and heteroclinic trajectories and tangencies\n[22, 23]. We do not consider it here. Rather, we give a brief interpretation of the resonance-related\nchaos in physical terms1. For the sake of clarity, consider an ac-driven 1D Hamiltonian system\nwhose frequency of eigenoscillation \u03c9 increases monotonically with the energy of eigenoscillation\nE \u2261 H0(p, q), while the perturbation frequency \u03c9f exceeds the minimum of \u03c9(E), as shown in\nFig. 3:\n1This was given for the first time by Chirikov [24] (a clear presentation of the issues in question can be found e.g. in [17]).\nNovember 6, 2009 11:1 Contemporary Physics CPstochasticwebs\u02d9resub\nStochastic webs and quantum transport 5\nH = H0(p, q)\u2212 hq cos(\u03c9f t), (8)\nh\u00bf 1,\n\u03c9f > \u03c90 \u2261 min{\u03c9(E)}.\nThen there necessarily exists an energy Er such that the resonance condition (7) with n = l = 1\nholds true:\n\u03c9(Er) = \u03c9f . (9)\nConsider motion for energies close to Er.

Thus, allowing for the resonance condition (9), we\nmay introduce the slow angle \u03b8\u02dc \u2261 \u03b8 \u2212 \u03c9f t and present the original Hamiltonian as a sum of an\n\u201cautonomous\u201dpart H\u02dc0(I, \u03b8\u02dc) and the time-dependent (fast-oscillating) part Vf (I, \u03b8\u02dc, t). It is easy\nto check by direct substitution into the corresponding Hamiltonian equations of motion that the\ndynamics of the variables I and \u03b8\u02dc is governed by the Hamiltonian\n\u02dc\u02dcH = H\u02dc \u2212 \u03c9fI. (11)\nTaking into account that the perturbation is small (h\u00bf 1) and, therefore, that the variation of\nI around the resonance value Ir \u2261 I(Er) is also small, we may approximate the function \u03c9(I)\nnear the resonance value as\n\u03c9(I) \u2248 \u03c9f + \u03c9\u2032r(I \u2212 Ir), (12)\n\u03c9\u2032r \u2261\nd\u03c9\ndI\n|I=Ir .\nFrom (10)-(12), we ultimately obtain the approximate auxiliary Hamiltonian governing the dy-\nNovember 6, 2009 11:1 Contemporary Physics CPstochasticwebs\u02d9resub\n6 Soskin, McClintock, Fromhold, Khovanov & Mannella\nnamics of {I, \u03b8\u02dc}:\n\u02dc\u02dcH(I, \u03b8\u02dc, t) =\n1\n2\n\u03c9\u2032r(I \u2212 Ir)2 \u2212\n1\n2\nhq1 cos(\u03b8\u02dc) + Vf (I, \u03b8\u02dc, t)\n\u2261 \u02dc\u02dcH0(I\u02dc \u2261 I \u2212 Ir, \u03b8\u02dc) + Vf . (13)\nIt represents the sum of a pendulum-like1 autonomous Hamiltonian \u02dc\u02dcH0(I\u02dc , \u03b8\u02dc) and a time-periodic\n(fast-oscillating) part Vf that plays the role of a perturbation. The pendulum-like part\n\u02dc\u02dcH0\npossesses a separatrix (cf. Fig. 2(a)) while the perturbation-like part Vf tends to destroy the\nseparatrix, replacing it with an exponentially narrow chaotic layer.\nThus we have shown that a resonance is necessarily associated with a narrow chaotic layer.\n2 Stochastic webs\nIn the example considered above, the chaotic layer associated with the resonance provides only\na narrow (\u221d \u221ah) variation of energy (or, equivalently, of action). Thus, there is no significant\ntransport in energy. Let us pose a question: could there be situations when a perturbation provides\nfor chaotic transport through a large range of energies? We now describe the three stages of\nconceptual evolution that led to a positive answer to this question.\n2.1 Multi-dimensional web\nFirst, Arnold showed in 1964 [25] through rather simple topological arguments (also presented\nclearly in [17]) that, if the system is multi-dimensional (namely, if N \u2265 5\/2), and if the so called\nnon-degeneracy condition det(\u22022H\/\u2202Ii\u2202Ij) 6= 0 is fulfilled (in other words, if the system is\nsufficiently nonlinear), then resonances necessarily intersect with each other, forming an infinite\nweb in the phase space along which an exponentially slow chaotic diffusion occurs.\n2.2 Low-dimensional webs\nSecondly, Chernikov et al. published an important series of papers in the late 1980s. We shall\nreview just three of the more important of them, concentrating on the model of a harmonic\noscillator subject to a plane wave, which will be relevant to our discussion of semiconductor SLs\nbelow. A good review of a broad range of the early work on low-dimensional stochastic webs\nmay be found in [1]; more recent work is reviewed in [26] (see also [17]).\nThe main idea of Chernikov et al. is that a stochastic web may arise even in low-dimensional\nsystems (N = 32 ; 2) provided that the non-degeneracy condition is lifted, in other words, in this\ncase, if\nd\u03c9\ndI\n= 0, (14)\nwhile the perturbation in the equation of motion is resonant and coordinate-dependent.\n2.2.1 Cobweb\nWe now consider the best known example of a low-dimensional stochastic web, the skeleton of\nwhich in p \u2212 q Poincare\u00b4 section has a form resembling that of a cobweb (Figs. 4(a), 5(b)). We\n1I\u02dc plays the role of a generalized velocity while \u03b8\u02dc plays the role of the generalized coordinate. Note that the generalized\npotential contains the small multiplier h, so that the maximal absolute value of the \u201cvelocity\u201dI\u02dc is proportional to\n\u221a\nh and,\ntherefore, is small too.\nNovember 6, 2009 11:1 Contemporary Physics CPstochasticwebs\u02d9resub\nStochastic webs and quantum transport 7\nFigure 4.

In order to understand the origin of the stochastic\nweb shown in Fig. 4, we\n(i) transform to polar coordinates {\u03c1, \u03b8} or, equivalently, to action-angle variables {I, \u03b8}:\nq = \u03c1 sin(\u03b8), p \u2261 q\u02d9 = \u03c90\u03c1 cos(\u03b8), (16)\n\u03c1 \u2261\n\u221a\n2I\n\u03c90\n,\n(ii) make use of the formula [28]\ncos(x sin(\u03b8)\u2212 y) =\n\u221e\u2211\nm=0\nJm(x) cos(m\u03b8 \u2212 y) (17)\nwhere Jm(x) is a Bessel function of the mth order1.\nUsing (16) and (17), it is not difficult to show that the Hamiltonian of a harmonic oscillator\nperturbed by a plane wave can be represented in action-angle variables as\nH(I, \u03b8, t) = \u03c90I + \u00b2\n\u03c920\nk2\n\u2211\nm\nJm(k\u03c1(I)) cos(m\u03b8 \u2212 \u03bdt). (18)\nNote that, due to the resonance condition \u03bd = n\u03c90 in (15), the term in the sum in (18) cor-\nresponding to m = n is nearly constant compared to other terms in the sum.

The other terms in the sum play the role of fast-oscillating\nperturbations. So we again introduce a slow variable, the angle \u03b8\u02dc \u2261 n\u03b8\u2212 \u03bdt. It is also convenient\nto introduce the normalized action I\u02dc \u2261 I\/n. The dynamics of the slow variables {I\u02dc , \u03b8\u02dc} is then\ngoverned by the auxiliary Hamiltonian H\u02dc \u2261 nH \u2212 \u03bdI\u02dc (as may readily be checked by direct\nsubstitution into the Hamiltonian equations of motion).

The vertical fil-\naments of the grid correspond to \u03b8\u02dc being equal to odd multiples of pi\/2 while the horizontal\nfilaments correspond to zeros of the relevant Bessel function,\nseparatrix : H\u02dcs = 0 : (20)\n\u03b8\u02dc = (2j + 1)\npi\n2\n, j = 0,\u00b11,\u00b12, . . . ,\nI\u02dc = I\u02dci, i = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,\nJn(k\u03c1(I\u02dci)) = 0.\nNote that the grid-like separatrix does not depend on the amplitude of the original perturbation.\nRather its form is an inherent property of the harmonic oscillator driven by the resonant plane\nwave.\nThe fast-oscillating term V\u02dcf replaces this grid-like separatrix by the narrow chaotic layer. If\nthe separatrix (20) is represented in the Poincare\u00b4 section p \u2212 q, it takes precisely the cobweb\nform shown schematically in the right-hand panel of Fig. 5. Thus we have achieved the primary\ngoal of this subsection, to explain the onset of the cobweb-like stochastic web.\nNovember 6, 2009 11:1 Contemporary Physics CPstochasticwebs\u02d9resub\nStochastic webs and quantum transport 9\n\u03b8i\n~ \u03b8i+1\n~\n\u03b8\u223c\nIi\n~\nIi+1\n~\nI~\n\u2206H~\nFigure 6.

Typical dependence (schematic) of the width of a separatrix chaotic layer on the ratio between the frequency of\nperturbation and the frequency of the small-amplitude oscillation of the unperturbed system.\n2.2.2 Width of the cobweb\nTransport through the web is affected, not only by the shape of the web\u2019s skeleton, but also\nby its width, i.e. the width of the chaotic layer (Fig. 6). An exact calculation of the width is\na complicated task that we will not undertake here. Rather, we will make a rough estimate\nsufficient to lead us to definite qualitative conclusions.\nBefore doing so, we make a general comment about the width in the case of a 1D system with a\nseparatrix that is being perturbed by a time-periodic perturbation. The width depends strongly\non the ratio \u03c9f between the frequency of the perturbation \u03c9perturbation and the frequency of small-\namplitude eigenoscillations \u03c9unperturbed. A schematic representation of the typical dependence is\nshown in Fig. 7. This figure will be discussed in more detail in Section 3. In the present context it\nis sufficient to emphasize that, if \u03c9f is large, then the width of the chaotic layer is exponentially\nnarrow.\nLet us now turn to the case of the web. As seen from (19), the characteristic frequency of the\nperturbation V\u02dcf is \u223c \u03c90. On the other hand, the unperturbed Hamiltonian H\u02dcs is proportional\nto the small parameter \u00b2. Therefore, even without a careful analysis of its oscillations, it is clear\nthat the frequency of oscillation in any cell of its grid-like separatrix is also small. Thus, we\nconclude that the ratio \u03c9f between the perturbation frequency and the eigenfrequency is large,\nso that the width of the layer should be exponentially small. This conclusion is confirmed both\nby careful theoretical analysis and by numerical simulations [1, 27].\nMoreover, the analysis of oscillations near the elliptic points inside the cells of the separatrix\nof H\u02dcs shows that, for cells far from the centre, the frequency of oscillation possesses the following\nproperty[1, 27]\n\u03c9unperturbed \u221d \u00b2\nI3\/4\n, (21)\ni.e. it decreases as the distance from the centre increases. Conversely, the ratio \u03c9f increases.\nNovember 6, 2009 11:1 Contemporary Physics CPstochasticwebs\u02d9resub\n10 Soskin, McClintock, Fromhold, Khovanov & Mannella\n-pi\/2 pi\/2 3pi\/2 5pi\/2 7pi\/2\n\u03b8\u223c\nI1\n~\nI2\n~\nI3\n~\nI4\n~\nI~\nFigure 8. The separatrix for inexact resonance: the single grid-like separatrix of Fig. 5 is replaced by a set of separatrices\nthat are distinctly separated from each other. The parameters used to compute the separatrix were: \u2206\u03c9 = \u22120.001 6= 0 (see\nEq. (22)), \u00b2 = 0.573 and n = k = 1.\nThis means that the width of the layer decreases exponentially quickly as the distance from the\ncentre of the web increases. This conclusion is confirmed by Fig. 4 above: even for the moderate\n\u00b2 used in this case, the width of the layer markedly decreases as the distance from the centre\ngrows.\n2.2.3 Inexact resonance\nNatural questions to ask in relation to the cobweb are: what happens if the oscillator differs\nslightly from an ideal harmonic oscillator; and what happens if the resonance is inexact? The\nanswers were given by Chernikov et al. [29] (see also [1]). They found that the effects of anhar-\nmonicity and inexact resonance are in fact similar. So in what follows we shall, for the sake of\nbrevity, consider only the inexactness of the resonance:\n\u03bd = n\u03c90 +\u2206\u03c9, \u2206\u03c9 \u00bf \u03c90. (22)\nIn this case, the autonomous resonance Hamiltonian reads as (cf. (19))\nH\u02dcs = \u2206\u03c9I\u02dc +\n\u00b2n\nk2\n\u03c920Jn(k\u03c1(I\u02dc)) cos(\u03b8\u02dc) (23)\nAs before, there are saddle points corresponding to different values of I\u02dc, namely different roots\nof the equation Jn(k\u03c1(I\u02dc)) = 0. But this means that, unlike the resonance case (\u2206\u03c9 = 0), the\nvalues of H\u02dcs at the saddles corresponding to different I\u02dc are themselves different. This means\nthat the single grid-like separatrix splits into infinitely many different separatrices (Fig. 8).\nIn order for at least two lowest separatrices to be connected, allowing chaotic transport within\na unified structure (a web of a finite size, in the p \u2212 q plane), the width of the chaotic layer\nshould be more than, or of the order of, the difference in H\u02dcs between the two lowest separatrices:\n\u2206H\u02dc\n\u223c\n> |H\u02dcs(I\u02dc2)\u2212 H\u02dcs(I\u02dc1)| \u223c 2pi|\u2206\u03c9|. (24)\nBecause \u2206H\u02dc is exponentially narrow, as discussed in Section 2.2.2 above, the inequality (24)\nmeans that the stochastic web may be formed only if the perturbation frequency lies in an\nexponentially small vicinity of the resonance.\n2.2.4 Uniform web\nAs already demonstrated above, the cobweb cannot in practice provide transport to arbitrarily\nlarge energies because of the exponentially fast decrease in the width of the chaotic layer with\ndistance from the centre of the web. This limitation is overcome in another type of the stochastic\nNovember 6, 2009 11:1 Contemporary Physics CPstochasticwebs\u02d9resub\nStochastic webs and quantum transport 11\nFigure 9. Example of a uniform web in p\u2212 q Poincare\u00b4 section [1].\nweb, called the uniform web [30] (see also [1]). Here, instead of being perturbed by a plane wave,\nthe harmonic oscillator is perturbed by short kicks that are periodic in space and time such that\nthe kick frequency is equal to the eigenfrequency of the oscillator or to one of its multiples:\nq\u00a8 + q = \u2212\u00b2 sin(kq)\n\u221e\u2211\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\u03b4(t\u2212 nT ), (25)\nT =\n2pi\n\u03bd\n, \u03bd = 1, 2, 3, . . .\nThe web then covers the whole phase space uniformly, as shown in Fig. 9.\nWe note however that the width of the chaotic layer is still exponentially small if the amplitude\nof the perturbation is small [1, 29].\n3 Modified stochastic webs\nIt is clear from the above discussion that a serious limitation affecting transport through any\nchaotic web is the exponential narrowness of the web\u2019s chaotic layer, which leads to exponentially\nslow transport. Soskin et al. [21, 31, 32] recently suggested a way of overcoming this problem by\nmaking a subtle modification of the webs leading, in turn, to exponential growth in the width of\nthe chaotic layer. We shall demonstrate this idea on our example of the cobweb, both because\nit is relevant to the application to the semiconductor SLs and because, in this case, it also leads\nto a dramatic increase in the size of the web.\n3.1 Exact resonance case\nWe have found that there is an inherent limitation in the size of the cobweb. It does not relate\nto the inevitably finite time of numerical simulations, which places a practical limit on the\ndistance over which the transport can be followed, but is characteristic of the cobweb itself. Our\nnumerical simulations show (Fig. 10) that, for the given parameters, the inner two-and-a-half\nloops of the web are distinctly separated from the adjacent outer one-and-a-half loops by regular\ntrajectories. This might possibly be accounted for theoretically by consideration of higher-order\napproximations of the averaging method [33]. We may speculate that such an approach could\nshow that, instead of a single infinite cobweb skeleton, there are many separate separatrices (of\nthe one-and-a-half loop shape) lying closely together, but that they might then coalesce due\nto the chaotic layers dressing them as a result of the perturbation. Because the width of the\nlayer decreases exponentially fast with increasing distance from the centre, this would mean\nthat coalescence would occur only within a few inner loops. Just this is observed in Fig. 10, even\ndespite that \u00b2 is moderate rather than small.\nNovember 6, 2009 11:1 Contemporary Physics CPstochasticwebs\u02d9resub\n12 Soskin, McClintock, Fromhold, Khovanov & Mannella\n1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6\n\u22120.4\n\u22120.2\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n q\/2pi\n \ndq\n\/d\nt\nFigure 10. Left figure. Poincare\u00b4 section for the system q\u00a8 + q = cos(q \u2212 t). The saddles (marked by green circles) have\nbeen found numerically. Four inner saddles belong to one and the same chaotic trajectory (shown in black) which forms\ntwo-and-a-half inner loops of the stochastic web. Two remaining (outer) saddles generate another (shown in red) chaotic\ntrajectory which covers a very thin chaotic layer and is distinctly separated from the black chaotic trajectory. Right figure.\nThe area within the dashed magenta rectangle of the left figure is shown on a larger scale. Apart from the black and red\nchaotic trajectories, we show (in magenta and blue) examples of regular trajectories (corresponding to invariant tori) lying\nin between the chaotic trajectories.\nOne may reasonably ask: Is there any subtle way to substantially increase the size of the web\nand to enhance transport through it?\nIn order to answer this question, let us recall the reason for the exponential narrowness of the\nchaotic layer. It follows from Fig. 7 that it is attributable to the frequency of the perturbation V\u02dcf\nbeing much higher than the eigenfrequency of the unperturbed resonant Hamiltonian H\u02dcs. It is\nclear from Fig. 7 that the width of the layer would be much larger if we could manage to modify\nthe original system in such a way that a new perturbation of the resonance Hamiltonian had a\ncomponent whose frequency was of the order of, or less than, the eigenfrequency of the resonance\nHamiltonian H\u02dcs. In fact, this may readily be accomplished in at least two different ways: (i) one\ncan add to the original plane wave a small perturbation of the slightly shifted frequency (it can\nitself be e.g. a plane wave); (ii) one can modulate weakly the angle of the original plane wave at\na low frequency. We demonstrate below only the second option (it will be especially convenient\nfor realization of the phenomena in SLs, as shown in Section 4 below).\nWe therefore consider the modified system (cf. the original Eq. (15)):\nq\u00a8 + \u03c920q = \u00b2\n\u03c920\nk\nsin(kq \u2212 \u03bdt\u2212 h sin(\u2126t)), (26)\n\u03bd = n\u03c90, n = 1, 2, 3, ...,\nh\u00bf 1, \u2126 \u223c< \u03c9unperturbed \u223c \u00b2\u03c90\nI3\/4\n.\nOf course, the latter inequality cannot be satisfied for an arbitrarily large I, but it can be true\nfor a sufficiently high value of I which greatly exceeds the original cobweb size in terms of I.\nRepeating the same procedure used above in the derivation of Eq. (19), i.e. transforming to\naction-angle variables, introducing the slow angle \u03b8\u02dc and the auxiliary Hamiltonian H\u02dc \u2261 nH\u2212\u03bdI\u02dc\nwhich governs the dynamics of {I\u02dc \u2212 \u03b8\u02dc}, we can derive:\nH\u02dc = H\u02dc(modified)s + V\u02dcf , (27)\nH\u02dc(modified)s \u2248 H\u02dcs + h\n\u00b2n\nk2\n\u03c920Jn(k\u03c1(I\u02dc)) sin(\u03b8\u02dc) sin(\u2126t)\nNovember 6, 2009 11:1 Contemporary Physics CPstochasticwebs\u02d9resub\nStochastic webs and quantum transport 13\nFigure 11.

The left panel corresponds to the conventional case considered\nin [1, 17, 27]. The right panel demonstrates that the modulation, although weak, greatly enlarges the web size (note the\ndifferent axes scales), thereby greatly enhancing the chaotic transport. The inset in the top right hand-corner plots the\nleft-hand panel on the same scale, thereby illustrating the dramatic extent of this enlargement.\nFigure 12. Dynamics of the energy for the same systems as in Fig. 11.\n(in the derivation, we took into account in particular the smallness of h).\nUnlike the original autonomous slow resonance Hamiltonian H\u02dcs \u2261 H\u02dcs(I\u02dc , \u03b8\u02dc), the modified slow\npart of the Hamiltonian, i.e. H\u02dc(modified)s , depends on time: it contains a term \u221d h which oscillates\nat a low frequency \u2126. It is this slowly oscillating additional term (rather than the former fast-\noscillating perturbation term V\u02dcf ) that now determines the width of the layer: the width is\nmoderately small (due to the smallness of h and \u00b2), rather than exponentially small as in the\noriginal setup. This exponential growth in the width of the layer gives rise to substantial growth\nin the size of the cobweb.\nTo illustrate the above ideas, we use the following example:\nq\u00a8 + q = 0.1 sin[15q \u2212 4t\u2212 h sin(0.02 t)]. (28)\nFor h = 0, this coincides with the conventional cobweb example developed in [1, 17, 27].\nComparison of the left and right panels of Fig. 11, corresponding to h = 0 and h = 0.1\nrespectively, reveals a 6-fold increase in the size of the web in terms of q and p \u2261 dq\/dt:\nnq,p \u2248 6.

The area of {h, \u03c9f} for which there is a global chaos between the separatrices is shaded.\nThe lower boundary of the shaded area therefore corresponds to the onset of global chaos, representing the function hcr(\u03c9f ).\nWe emphasize that the modulation giving rise to this substantial increase is actually very small:\nits amplitude of 0.1 is about 60 times smaller than 2pi which is the relevant scale for the angle.\nThe corresponding increase of the size in terms of energy is proportional to the square of nq,p:\nnE = n2q,p \u2248 36. (30)\nFig. 12 shows this explicitly and, in addition, demonstrates that the mode of transport is signif-\nicantly changed.\n3.2 Inexact resonance\nOur idea of an additional small modulation of the angle of the plane wave is equally fruitful\nin the case of an inexact resonance. The frequency band (around the resonance) in which the\nweb-like structure is formed may grow exponentially: instead of the exponentially narrow band\nfound in the absence of modulation, we may have a moderately narrow band.\nMoreover, there is a nontrivial spectral dependence of this growth: it reflects a universal\nmechanism for facilitation of the onset of chaos between adjacent separatrices, discovered recently\nby Soskin, Mannella and Yevtushenko [34]. To explain this mechanism, we use their example:\nit is a potential system with a spatially periodic potential possessing two barriers of different\nheight within one period (Fig. 13(a)). Naturally, there are two kinds of separatrices (Fig. 13(b)).\nIt was shown [34] that the frequency of oscillation \u03c9 as a function of energy E possesses a local\nmaximum \u03c9m between the separatrices and, moreover, \u03c9 is close to \u03c9m over most of the inter-\nseparatrix energy range (Fig. 13(c)). The latter property is valid for any system with two or\nmore separatrices and is particularly important in the present context.\nIf we perturb the system with a time-periodic perturbation of frequency slightly lower than\n\u03c9m then, due to the flatness of \u03c9(E) over most of the inter-separatrix range of E, two nonlinear\nNovember 6, 2009 11:1 Contemporary Physics CPstochasticwebs\u02d9resub\nStochastic webs and quantum transport 15\n-1-0.75-0.5-0.250\nE ~\n0\n0.01\n0.02\n\u03c9\nFigure 15.

Even a rather small amplitude of per-\nturbation may be sufficient for these nonlinear resonances to overlap with each other and with\nthe separatrix chaotic layers, thus connecting the latter by the chaotic transport. This has been\nconfirmed both theoretically and in numerical simulations. Consequently, a critical perturbation\namplitude hcr is required for chaotic transport between the separatrix chaotic layers (which may\nbe considered as the onset of global chaos between them). As a function of the perturbation\nfrequency \u03c9f , it possesses a deep minimum1 at a frequency approximately equal to \u03c9m. This is\nnot only seen in the simulations (Fig. 14) but is also well described by the theory [34].\nThe situation is similar for modulation-assisted formation of the web in the case of inexact\nresonance between the plane wave frequency and that of the oscillator. To demonstrate this, we\nuse the following example (the parameters correspond to those used in experiments on semicon-\nductor SLs):\nq\u00a8 + q = \u00b2 sin[q \u2212 \u03bdt\u2212 h sin(\u2126t)], (31)\n\u03bd = 1.02292, \u00b2 = 0.573.\nFor h = 0, a stochastic web is not formed because the \u2206\u03c9 \u2261 \u03bd \u2212 1 \u2248 0.023 is too large for the\n1If the perturbation is parametric rather than additive, then the deepest minimum may occur at some multiple of \u03c9m rather\nthan at \u03c9m itself [34].\nNovember 6, 2009 11:1 Contemporary Physics CPstochasticwebs\u02d9resub\n16 Soskin, McClintock, Fromhold, Khovanov & Mannella\nchaotic connection of any separatrices of H\u02dcs (23) to occur. We have calculated numerically the\ntwo lowest separatrices in the plane I\u02dc \u2212 \u03b8\u02dc (cf. Fig. 8), and then obtained the frequency \u03c9 of\noscillation of I\u02dc (or, equivalently, of the shift by 2pi of \u03b8\u02dc) as a function of the auxiliary energy\nE\u02dc \u2261 H\u02dcs: see Fig. 15. There is a local maximum that is clearly similar to that in Fig. 13(c).\nThen we switch on the modulation of the wave angle and, for each given \u2126, increase h gradu-\nally, until the web is formed i.e. until chaotic connection occurs between the first two separatrices\nH\u02dcs. This may be considered as the formation of the web. The spectral dependence of the corre-\nsponding critical amplitude is shown in Fig. 16. Similar to Fig. 14, it exhibits a deep minimum\n(note the logarithmic scale) at a frequency which is a little smaller than the local maximum of\nthe dependence \u03c9(E\u02dc): cf. Fig. 16.\n4 Semiconductor superlattices in electric and magnetic fields\nAn application of the stochastic cobweb in nanoscience was recently identified and discussed\nin a series of publications by researchers from the University of Nottingham [5\u20138, 10]. They\nconsidered quantum electron transport in nanometre-scale 1D semiconductor SLs subject to a\nconstant electric field along the SL axis and to a constant magnetic field (Fig. 17(a,b)). The\nspatial periodicity of the SL layers gives rise to minibands for the electrons (Fig. 17(c)). In the\ntight-binding approximation, the electron\u2019s energy E as a function of its momentum ~p in the\nlowest miniband is given by [5, 8]\nE(~p) =\n\u2206[1\u2212 cos(pxd\/~)]\n2\n+\np2y + p\n2\nz\n2m\u2217\n, (32)\nwhere x is oriented along the SL axis, \u2206 is the miniband width, d is the SL period, and m\u2217 is\nthe electron effective mass for motion in the transverse (i.e. y-z) direction.\nThus, the quasi-classical motion of an electron of charge e in an electric field ~F and a magnetic\nfield ~B can be described by:\nd~p\ndt\n= \u2212e{~F + [\u2207~pE(~p)\u00d7 ~B]}. (33)\nIt was shown in [5] that, for a constant electric field along the SL axis ~F = (\u2212F, 0, 0) and constant\nmagnetic field with a given angle \u03b8 to the axis ~B = (B cos(\u03b8), 0, B sin(\u03b8)), the dynamics of the z-\ncomponent of momentum pz reduces to the equation of motion of an auxiliary harmonic oscillator\nNovember 6, 2009 11:1 Contemporary Physics CPstochasticwebs\u02d9resub\nStochastic webs and quantum transport 17\nsubject to a plane wave i.e. to the equation considered in the previous sections1,2:\np\u00a8z + \u03c920pz = \u00b2\n\u03c920\nk\nsin(kpz \u2212 \u03bdt+ \u03c6), (34)\n\u03c90 = \u03c9c cos(\u03b8), \u03c9c \u2261 Be\nm\u2217\n,\n\u03bd = \u03c9B, \u03c9B \u2261 eFd~ ,\n\u00b2 =\n\u2206m\u2217d2 tan2(\u03b8)\n~2\n,\nk =\nd tan(\u03b8)\n~\n,\n\u03c6 = pi +\nd\n~\n[px(t = 0) + pz(t = 0) tan(\u03b8)].\nWe emphasize that, despite its classical appearance, Eq. (34) has an inherently quantum origin:\nmost of the parameters contain Planck\u2019s constant ~.\nThe dynamics of the system is fully determined by the dynamics of pz. Fig. 18 shows how the\ntrajectory of an electron in the x-z plane changes with the angle of the magnetic field.\nAt \u03b8 = 0, the plane wave has zero amplitude and the motion along the x- and z-directions\nis separable. Electrons undergo Bloch oscillations along x (due to the presence of the constant\nelectric field) and cyclotron motion about ~B (Fig. 18(a)). The motion is localized.\nTilting ~B produces nonlinear coupling of the Bloch and cyclotron motion: as \u03b8 6= 0, the\nplane wave in (34) acquires a non-zero amplitude. This causes some moderate delocalization of\ntrajectories (Fig. 18(b)). The delocalization grows very fast (Fig. 18(c)) when \u03b8 reaches values\ncorresponding to the integer values r \u2261 \u03c9B\/(\u03c9c cos(\u03b8)), in other words to the resonance \u03bd = n\u03c90.\nThis strong delocalization in x is a consequence of the onset of the stochastic web for the motion\nof pz (34).\nIt is remarkable that the quantum probability density |\u03a8(x, z)|2, calculated by solution of the\nSchro\u00a8dinger equation in the SL model potential subjected to electric and magnetic fields should\nso nicely follow quasi-classical trajectories based on the dynamics of pz (34): see Fig. 18.\nAs shown in [5, 6], the delocalization of the electrons1 strongly affects their drift velocity vd\nand, as a consequence, the current I and the current-voltage dependence I(V ). There are clear\nmanifestations of the resonances, both in the theoretical curves vd(F ), I(V ), dI\/dV (see Fig.\n17(d), Fig. 19(c) and Fig. 19(d) respectively), and in the experimental curves I(V ) and dI\/dV\n(Figs. 19(a) and (b) respectively). Thus there is clear evidence for stochastic web formation in\nquantum electron transport, providing the basis for a conceptually new method for its control.\nWhen scattering is included a priori in the semiclassical equations of motion, the stochastic\nweb, and stable islands that it enmeshes, evolve into limit cycles. These limit cycles also exhibit\nsharp resonant delocalization and their locations in phase space closely reflect the underlying\nweb topology [8].\nFinally, we pose a question: could the modification of the stochastic web discussed in the\nprevious section be of use for the SLs? Its seems [21, 31, 32] that this is indeed the case. As\nshown in Section 3 above, modulation of the wave angle results in a large increase of the web\nsize. It was noted in [5] that the delocalization in x is proportional to the web size in terms of\nthe energy of the oscillator in pz, i.e. to E = p\u02d9z2\/2 + \u03c920p\n2\nz\/2 (cf. Fig. 18). The only question is\n1The only small difference is the presence of a constant shift \u03c6 in the wave angle, but it is inessential.\n2The motion of electrons in a biased SL with a tilted magnetic field can also be linked to the ultra-fast Fiske effect observed\nfor a Josephson junction coupled to an electromagnetic resonator [35].\n1Seemingly paradoxically, one must take account of scattering in the calculation: if the motion were purely Hamiltonian,\nthe position of the electron averaged over time would be constant.\nNovember 6, 2009 11:1 Contemporary Physics CPstochasticwebs\u02d9resub\n18 Soskin, McClintock, Fromhold, Khovanov & Mannella\nx\nEnergy\nv\nd\n(1\n0\nm\ns\n)\n3\n-1\nF ( Vm )-1106\nSuperlatticeunit cell, repeated 14 times\n(a)\n(b)\n(c) (d)\n0\nE (meV)\n-h\n2d\nh\n2d\n100\n200\npx\ny\nx\nz B\nF\nq\n6\n3\n0\n0 1 2 3 4 5\nV\nFigure 17.

One suggestion [21, 31, 32] is that, in a manner similar to the derivation of Eq.\n(34), one can show that the modulation term in the equation for pz appears if an ac-component\nis added to the constant electric field:\nF \u2192 F + Fac cos(\u03c9act).

But when the electron transfers\nonto the quasi-linear filaments, it shifts rapidly along x, following widely spaced orbital loops (within bracket), which\ncorrespond to low probability density.

In order to achieve this,\nwe need Fac\/F = h\u2126\/(\u03bd\/\u03c90) = 1\/2000. This means that in order to achieve delocalization of the\nelectron by a factor of about 40, we need to add to the constant electric field an ac-component of\namplitude that is smaller than the constant component by a factor of 2000! We remind the reader\nthat the reason for such a dramatic change when an ac-component is added is the exponentially\nstrong enhancement of chaotic transport through the stochastic web due to the modulation of\nthe wave angle.\nRecently, the effects of stochastic web formation on the high-frequency (GHz-THz) perfor-\nmance of the SLs has been considered [10, 11].

Chaos-assisted motion through stochastic webs\nmay, therefore, provide a mechanism for controlling the collective dynamics of electrons in SLs\nand, hence, for enhancing their THz performance by using single-particle miniband transport to\ntailor the shape of the vd(F ) curves.\n5 Conclusions\nWe have shown that, in general, there is a possibility for energy in a Hamiltonian system to be\nincreased from small to rather large values as a result of transport through a stochastic web.\nIn a multi-dimensional system, the onset of a stochastic web is a common phenomenon, pre-\ndicted by Arnold in 1964. In the present review, we have been more interested in the low-\ndimensional stochastic webs discovered by Chernikov et al. in the late 1980s. They occur in\nspecial situations: in a harmonic, or nearly harmonic, oscillator driven by perturbations periodic\nin time and space that are resonant, or nearly resonant, with the oscillator.\nWe emphasized that the stochastic cobweb can arise when the oscillator is driven by a weak\nresonant, or nearly resonant, plane wave. The exponentially small width of a strand of the web is\na characteristic feature of all stochastic webs and it decreases exponentially fast as the distance\nfrom the centre of the cobweb increases. Moreover there is an inherent limitation on the size of\nthe cobweb. Soskin et al. have suggested how to overcome the restriction in size of the cobweb\nand the exponential narrowness of its chaotic layer, just by slightly modifying the system by\nmeans of a small slow modulation of the angle of the plane wave.\nThe model of the stochastic web turned out to be directly relevant to the quantum transport\nof electrons in semiconductor SLs in constant electric and magnetic fields, as demonstrated by\nNovember 6, 2009 11:1 Contemporary Physics CPstochasticwebs\u02d9resub\nStochastic webs and quantum transport 21\nFromhold et al.: the quantum transport dynamics reduces to the model of the harmonic oscillator\nperturbed by a plane wave, where parameters are determined by the values of the electric and\nmagnetic fields, by the angle between them, by the period of the SL, by the charge and the\neffective mass of the electron, and by Planck\u2019s constant. At certain values of the parameters,\nin particular of the electric field, resonance occurs between the oscillator and the plane wave,\nresulting in the onset of the stochastic cobweb and, consequently, in a strong delocalization of\nthe electron which, in turn, increases the current and gives rise to a peak in the dependence of\nthe differential conductivity on voltage.\nAn addition to the constant electric field of a small slow ac-component results in the slow\nmodulation of the plane angle and, therefore, promises to strongly increase the delocalization of\nthe electron and to enhance a range of related phenomena.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Royal Society of London, the\nInternational Centre for Theoretical Physics (Trieste), Pisa University and the Engineering and\nPhysical Sciences Research Council (UK).
