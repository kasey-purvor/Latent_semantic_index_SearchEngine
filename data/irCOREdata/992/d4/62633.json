Introduction 39 \nCoastal lagoons are characterized by large fluctuations in physical and 40 \nbiogeochemical conditions as a consequence of their location between land and 41 \nsea (Kjerfve 1994). Coastal lagoons are relatively shallow and tend to be 42 \ndominated by benthic primary producers, such as seagrass, macroalgae and 43 \nbenthic microalgae rather than by phytoplankton (Tyler et al. 2001). This 44 \npromotes a strong benthic-pelagic coupling that influences carbon and nutrient 45 \ndynamics, as well various aerobic and anaerobic respiration pathways. Like 46 \n 3 \nestuaries, coastal lagoons represent environments with high productivity (Pauly 47 \nand Ya\u00f1ez-Arancibia 1994). 48 \nCoupled hydrodynamic-ecosystem models are tools to assess the major 49 \nqualitative aspects of the ecosystem and help in addressing important issues for 50 \ncoastal zone management (Torres et al. 2006). Marine ecosystem models 51 \ndescribing the geochemical and biological cycling have been developed for many 52 \nregions particularly during the last 10 years. One of the most complex marine 53 \necosystem models developed to date is the European Regional Seas Ecosystem 54 \nModel (ERSEM; Baretta-Bekker et al. 1995). Originally developed as a box 55 \nmodel describing biogeochemical cycling within the North Sea, ERSEM has 56 \nnowadays been successfully adapted to other ecosystems. For example, Allen et 57 \nal. (1998) used the model in the Adriatic Sea to contrast the ecosystem 58 \nfunctionality. Blackford and Burkill (2002) have applied ERSEM in the Arabian 59 \nSea, to explore the differences between monsoonal waters and unperturbed 60 \noligotrophics oceanic sites, while Vichi et al. (1998) used the model on seasonal 61 \nresponse in shallow Northern Adriatic. In this study, we have used ERSEM 62 \ncoupled with the General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM), a 1-DV numerical 63 \nmodel with several modern turbulence closure schemes, which has become the 64 \ncommunity workhorse, to simulate the physical and biogeochemical processes in 65 \nSan Quintin Bay (SQB). For the model to be able to correctly represent SQB 66 \nbiogeochemistry, newly developed seagrass and macroalga modules had to be 67 \nincluded.  68 \n 4 \nSQB is a coastal lagoon (Figure 1) located in the coast of Baja California, 69 \nMexico (30\u00b027'N, 116\u00b000'W), covering an area of ~ 42  km2 with an average depth 70 \nof 2 m, a maximum tidal amplitude of 2.4 m during spring tides, and water 71 \ntemperature ranges of 11-22 \u00b0C and 13-27 \u00b0C at the m outh of the bay and at the 72 \ninner end of the eastern arm, respectively (Alvarez-Borrego and Alvarez-Borrego 73 \n1982). San Quintin is a Mediterranean-type coastal lagoon (Largier et al. 1997), 74 \nand is a hypersaline system throughout year (Camacho-Ibar et al. 2007). This 75 \ntemperate region of the Baja California Peninsula has a mean annual 76 \nprecipitation of 150 mm and a mean annual evaporation of 1400 mm; rainfall is 77 \nrestricted to the period of November to March. As evidenced by saline intrusion, 78 \nover extraction of groundwater for agriculture has induced a reversal of the 79 \ngroundwater flow in the coastal aquifers, making them an unlikely source of 80 \nnutrients to the bay (Aguirre-Mu\u00f1oz et al. 2001). Most of the inhabitants of the 81 \ncatchment, which is a rural area, live away from shore. Tourism, which is one of 82 \nthe main economic activities in the locality, is still limited and represents a minor 83 \nindirect source of nutrients to the bay. 84 \n SQB ecology is strongly influenced by the presence of extensive 85 \nmeadows of the eelgrass Zostera marina (Ward et al. 2003; Jorgensen et al. 86 \n2007). Ward et al. (2003) indicate that this species covers ~40% of this lagoon, 87 \nand is dispersed throughout the Bay, forming particularly dense patches at the 88 \ninner arms. Large mats of Ulva spp. are mainly concentrated in Bahia Falsa and 89 \nalso near the mouth of the bay. Although Ulva spp. is present all year around, its 90 \nbiomass shows a seasonal variation with a spring maximum. Biomasses of 1400 91 \n 5 \ndry t were measuredt during spring (May) 2004 and 1160 dry t in early summer 92 \n(June) 2005, distributed in an area of 431 and 303 ha, respectively. In winter 93 \n2004 Ulva biomass reached only 35 dry t in an area of 54 ha (Zertuche-94 \nGonz\u00e1lez, pers. comm., 2008).  95 \nThe Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas has been cultivated commercially in 96 \nthe western arm of the lagoon (Bahia Falsa) since the late 70\u2019s (Garc\u00eda-Esquivel 97 \net al. 2004), and represents a functional group that may be explicitly included in 98 \nthe SQB ecosystem model. 99 \nThe main external physical and biogeochemical forcing in this lagoon is 100 \nfrom the neighbouring coastal ocean, strongly influenced by upwelling. Although 101 \nwind conditions may induce upwelling events throughout the year in this area, the 102 \nmost intense upwelling occurs during spring and early summer (Bakun and 103 \nNelson 1977). Upwelling pulses advect water into SQB, supplying new nitrogen 104 \n(nitrate), which is rapidly taken-up and promotes high phytoplankton, macroalgae 105 \nand seagrass productivity and biomass within the bay (Camacho-Ibar et al. 106 \n2007). The frequency of the upwelling pulses likely controls the temporal 107 \nvariability of primary production and nutrients at the bay\u2019s mouth (Lara-Lara et al. 108 \n1980).  109 \n 110 \n2. Description of the modelling system 111 \nTo better understand the physical-biogeochemical interactions it was 112 \ndecided to use a one-dimensional vertical framework to combine the best 113 \nhydrodynamic model of this kind (GOTM) and one of the most complete 114 \n 6 \necological models available (ERSEM). A two way coupling between water 115 \ncolumn and biogeochemistry is applied. The dependence of the biogeochemistry 116 \non the physics is established via vertical mixing and horizontal advection of 117 \nnutrients, temperature and salinity, light availability and many other mechanisms. 118 \nThe advantage of using a 1-DV framework is that the hydrodynamics is kept as 119 \nsimple as possible, while still maintaining the necessary physical processes, in 120 \nsuch way that we can focus on studying the importance of the newly incorporated 121 \nfunctional groups (i.e. Z. marina and Ulva spp.).  122 \n 123 \n2.1 Physical model 124 \nA one-dimensional numerical model for the water column is applied here, 125 \nconsisting of prognostic equations for horizontal velocity components, 126 \ntemperature and salinity. Density is calculated by means of UNESCO equation of 127 \nstate (http:\/\/fermi.jhuapl.edu\/denscalc.html) as function of temperature and 128 \nsalinity and hydrostatic pressure. The model is externally forced by M2 and S2 129 \nbarotropic tidal currents derived from observations, and wind stress, surface heat 130 \nand momentum fluxes, calculated by bulk formulae using atmospheric 131 \nmeasurements. A detailed description of the numerical model is given by Bolding 132 \net al. (2002) and references therein (see http:\/\/www.gotm.net). 133 \nA k-\u03b5 turbulence closure scheme is used here, where the turbulent 134 \ndissipation rate is discussed in detail in Canuto et al. (2001) and Umlauf and 135 \nBurchard (2005). The stability functions used here are those suggested by 136 \nCanuto et al. (2001). 137 \n 7 \nAlthough advection of momentum has not been considered in the model, 138 \nthe horizontal velocities combined with horizontal nutrient gradients are used to 139 \ncalculate the horizontal advection of nutrients and in that way incorporate the 140 \nadvection of newly upwelled nutrients from the ocean.  141 \n 142 \n2.2 The ecological model 143 \nThe European Regional Seas Ecosystem Model was developed by a 144 \nnumber of scientists at several institutes across Europe through projects under 145 \nthe MAST Programme of the European Union. Many features and applications of 146 \nthe ERSEM model are described in Baretta et al. (1995) and Baretta-Bekker and 147 \nBaretta (1997).  148 \nERSEM is a modelling framework in which the ecosystem is represented 149 \nas a network of physical, chemical and biological processes. It uses a \u2018functional 150 \ngroup\u2019 approach to describe the ecosystem, whereby biota are grouped together 151 \naccording to their trophic level and sub-divided according to size and feeding 152 \nmethod. The ecosystem is subdivided into three functional group types: primary 153 \nproducers, consumers and decomposers. Physiological (ingestion, respiration, 154 \nexcretion and egestion) and population (growth, and mortality) processes are 155 \nincluded in the descriptions of functional group dynamics. These dynamics are 156 \ndescribed by fluxes of carbon and nutrients between functional groups. Each 157 \nfunctional group is defined by a number of components, namely carbon (C), 158 \nnitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) and, in the case of diatoms, silicate (Si), each 159 \nof which is explicitly modelled. The phytoplankton pool is described by four 160 \n 8 \nfunctional groups. These are diatoms, flagellates, picoplankton and 161 \nnanoplankton. All phytoplankton groups contain internal nutrient pools and have 162 \ndynamically varying C:N:P ratios. The nutrient uptake is controlled by the 163 \ndifference between the internal nutrient pool and external nutrient concentration. 164 \nThe microbial loop contains bacteria, mesozooplankton and microzooplankton 165 \neach with dynamically varying C:N:P ratios.  166 \nThe benthic sub-model contains a food web which describes nutrient and 167 \ncarbon cycling via both aerobic and anaerobic bacterial pathways, 168 \nbioturbation\/bioirrigation and the vertical transport in sediment of particulate 169 \nmatter is due to the activity of benthic biota.  The benthic nutrient model treats N, 170 \nP and Si, and their exchange with the pelagic system depending on the nutrient 171 \ngradients at the sediments surface. The mineralization of organic matter, coupled 172 \nto diagenetic nutrient processes in the sediments, is also included in the sub-173 \nmodel (Ruardij and van Raaphorst 1995). Detailed descriptions of ERSEM can 174 \nbe found in Baretta et al. (1995); Baretta-Bekker et al. (1995, 1997), Blackford 175 \n(1997), Ebenhoh et al. (1995). Full ERSEM model equations can be found at 176 \nhttp:\/\/www.pml.ac.uk\/ecomodels\/ersem.html. 177 \nIn an attempt to realistically simulate nutrient dynamics in the SQB 178 \necosystem, the food web with the trophic relationships among the different 179 \ngroups was set up as shown in Figure 2. State variables of Z. marina and Ulva 180 \nspp. are included (Table 1) to simulate the seasonal dynamics of their biomass.  181 \n 182 \n2.3 Seagrass module 183 \n 9 \n The Z. marina module is conceptually similar to the phytoplankton module 184 \nin ERSEM, and is based on the Z. marina model proposed by Bocci et al. (1997). 185 \nSeagrasses take nutrients from sediments through roots and rhizomes, and from 186 \nthe water column through their shoots. Therefore, the seagrass module includes 187 \na shoot sub-module which connects with the pelagic sub-model and a (rhizome-) 188 \nroot sub-module which connects with the benthic sub-model. Both sub-models 189 \nexchange nutrients through a translocation routine.  190 \nState variables included in the module are: leaf biomass (S1) and root 191 \nbiomass (S2). The rate of change of total biomass for Z. marina (S) is given by 192 \nthe combination of four processes. Production (pS), respiration (rS), exudation 193 \n(eS) and mortality (morS): 194 \nmorS)eSrS(pS\ndt\ndS\n\u2212\u2212\u2212=\n 195 \nLight and temperature control seagrass photosynthesis. The gross 196 \nproduction rate (pS) was then calculated by maximum growth rate (\u00b5max), 197 \nmodified by temperature (ft), light (fi) and nutrient limitation (fN) factors: 198 \nNf*itmax f*f*\u00b5pS =  199 \nThe dependence on water temperature (T) is common to all the 200 \nparameterizations of the functional groups and of many other biogeochemical 201 \nprocesses in ERSEM. It is written in an exponential form as: 202 \n10)(T*0.1\n10t qf \u2212=  203 \nwhere q10 is a temperature coefficient. 204 \n 10 \nThe light factor (fi) is a function of the extinction coefficient (xeps), water 205 \ndepth (z), and daily total radiation. The total radiation was calculated from the 206 \nratio of the superficial (PIo) and depth irradiance (PIz). Plo (the irradiance just 207 \nbelow the water surface) is the astronomical irradiance reduced by loss factors: 208 \ncloud cover, absorption and reflection on the water surface (Ebenhoh et al. 209 \n1997). The photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was multiplied by a 210 \nconversion factor (fPAR) in order to calculate superficial irradiance. 211 \nThe extinction coefficient was calculated as a function of the background 212 \nextinction of water, and extinction due to phytoplankton, particulate detritus and 213 \nsuspended inorganic matter. PKi is the photosynthesis half saturation constant.  214 \nfPAR*PARPIo =\n 215 \nz)*xepsexp(*PIoPIz \u2212=\n 216 \n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n=\ni\ni pK\nPIztanhf\n 217 \nSelf shading effect is not included in the model, as we assume that the 218 \nplant length (typically < 0.6 m) is smaller than the average water depth in SQB (~ 219 \n2 m), allowing leaves to float erect and reduce self-shading.  220 \nFouling on seagrass leaves has been reported as an important control on 221 \nlight availability, and thus on seagrass production, in eutrophic systems 222 \n(Borowitzka et al. 2006). This has lead to efforts to explicitly include epiphytic 223 \nalgae in seagrass models (Plus et al. 2003; Dixon 2004). However, we have not 224 \nincluded ephiphytic algae in our current Z. marina module since Jorgensen et al. 225 \n(2007) reported that, in SQB, neither eelgrass shoot nor aboveground biomass 226 \n 11 \nwere related to the epiphyte biomass over eelgrass leaves. These authors 227 \nreported relatively low epiphyte biomass on eelgrass leaves near the mouth of 228 \nthe lagoon, emphasizing a top-down control of epiphytes, despite high nutrient 229 \navailability (Jorgensen et al. 2007). 230 \nThe respiration rate (rS) is a function of the sum of the active respiration 231 \n(ract) and the basal respiration (rrest) rates, and the plant biomass. The active 232 \nrespiration rate is proportional to pS by a respiration coefficient (pu_raS). The 233 \nbasal respiration rate is a function of seawater temperature and a respiration 234 \ncoefficient (pu_reS). 235 \nS*ract)(rrestrS +=\n 236 \n(pu_raS)*pSract =\n 237 \n(pu_reS)*frrest t=  238 \nThe exudation process (eS) is a function of an exudation coefficient 239 \n(pu_eaS) t and the gross production rate: 240 \n(pu_eaS)*pSeS =\n 241 \nMortality is defined by a temperature factor (ft), a mortality coefficient 242 \n(pu_daS) related to tissue senescence, and seagrass biomass: 243 \nS*f*pu_daSmorS t=  244 \nThe rates of dissolved and particulate organic matter production in the Z. 245 \nmarina module (fSR1 and fSR6, respectively) are a function of an exudation rate 246 \nand mortality. The carbon fraction to particulate organic matter is defined by a 247 \nparameter that is the nitrogen and phosphorus fractions, determined by the 248 \n 12 \nminimal nitrogen\/carbon and phosphorus\/carbon quota. The organic matter 249 \nproduced in this module is transferred into the dissolved (R1) and particulate 250 \n(R6) organic matter pools in the pelagic sub-model: 251 \nmorSfSR6 =\n 252 \nS*eS fSR1 =\n 253 \nThe model considers Z. marina growth to be a function of the external 254 \nnutrient concentration and the nutrient content of the cell, i.e., the internal quota 255 \nrelative to its upper and lower limits according to the kinetics described by Droop 256 \n(1973). Leaves can consume both nitrate (N3) and ammonium (N4) while, for the 257 \nroots, only ammonium uptake is considered, because of the prevalence of this 258 \nform of nitrogen in the sediments. The internal nitrate and ammonium 259 \nconcentration in Z. marina N(3,4) and the phosphate (P) concentration is 260 \ncalculated according to a set of differential equations:  261 \nN(3,4)\u00b5uptake\ndt\ndN(3,4)\nmax \u2217\u2212=  262 \nP*\u00b5uptake\ndt\ndP\nmax\u2212=  263 \nf(N3,4)*uptakeS2)(uptakeS1uptake +=\n 264 \nN3N4 uptakeS1uptakeS1uptakeS1 +=  265 \nN4uptakeS2uptakeS2 =  266 \nIn the model, nutrient uptake rates are proportional to nutrient 267 \nconcentration in the water column according to Michaelis-Menten kinetics. 268 \nUptakeS1N4, uptakeS1N3 and uptakeS2N4 are, respectively, the uptake rates for 269 \n 13 \nammonium and nitrate by the shoots and the uptake rate of ammonium by the 270 \nroots. KS1N4, KS1N3 and KS2N4 are the half-saturation coefficients in the water 271 \ncolumn (w) and the sediments (s), and VmS1N4, VmS1N3 and VmS2N4, are the 272 \nmaximum uptake rates of nutrients: 273 \nN4\nN4N4 KS1[N4w]\n[N4w]VmS1uptakeS1\n+\n=\n 274 \nN3\nN3N3 KS1[N3w]\n[N3w]VmS1uptakeS1\n+\n=\n 275 \nN4\nN4N4 KS2[N4s]\n[N4s]VmS2uptakeS2\n+\n=\n 276 \n 277 \nThe range of internal nitrogen concentration is controlled by applying a feedback 278 \neffect to the uptake functions: 279 \nN(3,4)minN(3,4)max\nN(3,4)N(3,4)maxfN(3,4)\n\u2212\n\u2212\n=\n 280 \nIn the current version of the model, if the external nutrient concentration is high, 281 \nthe internal N concentration may reach its maximum, causing uptake to cease 282 \n(i.e., luxury N uptake and storage are not included in the model).

(1997). 284 \n 285 \n2.4 Macroalgae module 286 \nThe implementation of Ulva spp. module is conceptually similar to the Ulva 287 \nrigida model of Solidoro et al. (1997). 288 \n 14 \n The biomass of Ulva spp. is considered to be governed by the following 289 \nprocesses: production (pU), respiration (rU), exudation (eU) and mortality 290 \n(morU). The general differential equation for biomass (U, expressed as g DW m-291 \n2) which includes these processes is: 292 \nmorU)eUrU(pU\ndt\ndU\n\u2212\u2212\u2212=\n 293 \n 294 \nThe gross production rate (pU) is a function of the maximum growth rate 295 \n(\u00b5max, expressed in time-1), modified by temperature (ft), light (fi) and nutrient 296 \nlimitation (fN) factors:  297 \n Nitmax f*f*f*\u00b5pU =  298 \nThe temperature and irradiance functions are similar to those in the Z. 299 \nmarina module. The nutrient limitation factor employs \u201cDroop kinetics\u201d (Droop, 300 \n1973). The nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in Ulva spp. are calculated 301 \nlike in Z. marina module: 302 \nN(3,4)*\u00b5uptakeUuptakeU\ndt\ndN(3,4)\nmaxN3N4 \u2212+=  303 \nP*\u00b5uptakeU\ndt\ndP\nmaxP \u2212=  304 \nThe range of internal nutrient concentration is controlled by applying a feedback 305 \neffect to the uptake functions: 306 \nPminPmax\nPPmaxfP\n\u2212\n\u2212\n=\n 307 \n 15 \nThe nutrient limitation function assumes that Ulva spp. growth is 0 when the 308 \nsimulated internal quota equals the minimal internal quota: 309 \nP\nPmin1fP \u2212=  310 \n 311 \n3. Model application area, initial conditions and forcing 312 \nThe simulation period in this study corresponds to January 2004 to 313 \nOctober 2005 (beginning after a 1-year period initialization), a period which 314 \nincludes two seasons of upwelling intensification in April-June each year. Due to 315 \nthe one-dimensional character of GOTM, most of the state variables are 316 \nassumed to be horizontally homogeneous, depending only of the vertical z-317 \ncoordinate. The model is forced by local M2 and S2 along channel tidal currents 318 \nderived from an RDI acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) located near the 319 \nmouth of SQB (Figure 1). As the long axis of the channel at the mouth of the bay 320 \nwhere currents were measured is aligned in a north-south direction, and the 321 \nstation of simulation is orientated to \u2013 45\u00b0 of the m ain channel, measured tidal 322 \nvelocities were re-oriented. The physical model was forced with daily 323 \nobservations with a meteorological station of wind velocity, irradiance, air 324 \ntemperature and atmospheric pressure from the period 2004 (Figure 3) and 2005 325 \n(data not shown). The model was initialized with January 2004 temperature and 326 \nsalinity values. Some of the biogeochemical parameters in the ecosystem model 327 \nare based on in situ observations during field campaigns in spring and summer of 328 \n2004, spring 2005 and summer 2003 (e.g., Table 2 and 3). Due to the lack of 329 \nfield information, all other parameters are the standard ERSEM values. This 330 \n 16 \nappears to be a robust approximation, as demonstrated by Blackford et al. (2004) 331 \nfor a range of coastal environments, including coastal lagoons (Petihakis et al. 332 \n1999). 333 \nFor the initialization of the model and due to the lack of data for the 334 \nseasonality of nutrients in SQB throughout the whole year, it was assumed that 335 \nwinter nutrient concentrations are similar to values observed during mid-intensity 336 \nupwelling (6 \u00b5M for nitrate, 4 \u00b5M for ammonium, 2 \u00b5M for phosphorus and 15 \u00b5M 337 \nfor silicate). Experimental and literature data were used to parameterize the 338 \nscalars for each functional group. Some parameters that were not measured 339 \n(e.g. growth rates) were estimated and adjusted to better fit of the model (Table 2 340 \nand 3). The initial biomass was set to 60 g DW m-2 both for Z. marina and Ulva 341 \nspp. 342 \nThe station chosen for the simulations is located 2 km from the mouth of 343 \nthe bay (Figure 1). Nutrient concentration gradients used for the simulations 344 \n(Figure 4) were assumed to follow a seasonal cycle based on upwelling intensity 345 \n(see Pennington and Chavez 2000). The values used during the season of 346 \nupwelling intensification are within the higher range of our observations 347 \ncalculated from the difference in nutrient concentrations at adjacent sampling 348 \nstations (Figure 1). Upwelling in the spring 2005 was more intense in comparison 349 \nto 2004, thus nitrate gradients with which the model was forced were larger in 350 \n2005 (Figure 4). It was assumed that nutrient gradients during winter, where no 351 \nobservations are available, are small as biological activity in this season is 352 \nusually low and horizontal mixing may prevail. 353 \n 17 \n 354 \n4. Sensitivity analysis 355 \n To examine the influence of individual parameters and processes on 356 \nnutrient concentrations and primary producers biomass, a sensitivity analysis 357 \nwas performed. We have chosen parameters related to light and nutrient 358 \navailability which are the controlling factors on primary production in this 359 \necosystem. Sensitivity analysis has been done varying photosynthetically active 360 \nradiation (PAR), the light limitation factor, and the maximum uptake rates of 361 \nnitrate (VmS1N3 and VmUN3). Variations of + 30 and - 30% around the standard 362 \nsimulation have been applied to each parameter. In the case of PAR, the 363 \nstandard value used in the model is 50 W m-2 (~ 15 mol quanta m-2 d-1 reported 364 \nby Cabello-Pasini et al. 2003). In the case of the light limitation factor, a 365 \ndimensionless factor which depends on the light extinction coefficient (~1.1 m-1 366 \nfor SQB; Cabello-Pasini et al. 2003) and the light fraction of the day (~ 0.5, 12 h), 367 \nthe standard value used is 0.68. The light limitation factor is ~ 3*light fraction 368 \nday\/extinction coefficient *depth (Ebenh\u00f6h et al. 1997). The standard uptake rate 369 \nvalue for Z. marina (VmSN3) is 0.06 mg g DW-1 h-1 (Bocci et al. 1997) and the 370 \nstandard value for Ulva spp. (VmUN3) is 0.7 mg g DW-1 h-1 (Guimaraens et al. 371 \n2005). 372 \n 373 \n5. Results and discussion 374 \nIn order to model nutrient dynamics in shallow coastal ecosystems such 375 \nas estuaries and coastal lagoons, where macrophytes contribute significantly to 376 \n 18 \nprimary production, complex ecosystem models are required. ERSEM is a 377 \ncomplex model originally developed and validated for shelf waters (Baretta et al. 378 \n1995; Allen et al. 1998; Blackford y Burkill 2002) which has also been applied in 379 \none coastal lagoon, Gialova lagoon (Petihakis et al. 1999). In the latter case, 380 \nERSEM was simplified by reducing the number of original state variables and 381 \nkeeping phytoplankton as the only primary producers. In our study, in order to 382 \nrealistically simulate nutrient dynamics in SQB, newly developed seagrass and 383 \nmacroalgae modules had to be included. To validate the inclusion of these 384 \nmodules, and given the strong horizontal nutrient gradients induced in SQB by 385 \nupwelling events, GOTM had to include advection of nutrients.  386 \nThe inclusion of advection in GOTM results in higher nutrient 387 \nconcentrations in the simulations (Figure 5). The differences between the 388 \nsimulations with and without advection are particularly apparent during the 389 \nupwelling periods where both nitrate and ammonium show a better fit to field data 390 \n(Figure 5). Although the seasonal increase in nitrate concentrations during both 391 \nupwelling periods results from the increased concentration gradient (Figure 4), 392 \nthe peaks during such periods are likely caused by oscillations in phytoplankton 393 \nbiomass (Figure 6). 394 \nAdding advection to GOTM also results in higher biomass of all primary 395 \nproducers, leading to reported literature values of Z. marina, Ulva spp. and 396 \ndiatoms (Figure 6). Without advection, the maximum foliar biomass of Z. marina 397 \nduring summer-autumn is 100 g DW m-2 during both years. While the maximum 398 \nof 2004 (110 g DW m-2) with advection is only 10% higher that without advection, 399 \n 19 \nthe maximum of 2005 is ~ 50% higher that the biomass without advection. Ibarra-400 \nObando et al. (2007) reported an average annual foliar biomass in SQB of 75 g 401 \nDW m-2, with annual maxima ranging from ~ 80 to ~ 350 g DW m-2, and an 402 \naverage in the summer-autumn maxima of ~ 150 g DW m-2. In the case of Ulva 403 \nspp., without advection the early-summer maximum is similar in 2004 and 2005, 404 \nwith a value of ~ 80 g DW m-2, and when advection is included maxima are 120 405 \nand 130 g DW m-2 respectively. Zertuche-Gonz\u00e1lez (pers. comm., 2008) report 406 \nbiomasses ~ 350 g DW m-2 within Ulva spp. beds near our simulation station in 407 \nSQB in spring-summer 2004 and 2005, and ~ 65 g DW m-2 in late winter 2005. 408 \nAs biomasses reported by these authors are for Ulva spp. beds (i.e. a site with 409 \n100% cover by this macrophyte), their values should be considered an upper 410 \nlimit for biomasses expected at our simulation site where Ulva spp. and Z. marina 411 \nco-exist. Without advection, spring diatom blooms are essentially absent in our 412 \nruns while several blooms appear, with particularly high intensity, in May and 413 \nJune when advection is added. Maximum diatom biomasses of 250 - 300 mg C 414 \nm-3 are consistent with biomasses of ~ 240 mg C m-3 estimated from chlorophyll 415 \na measurements (~ 4 mg Chla m-3) reported by Millan-Nu\u00f1ez et al. (1982) for 416 \nJune-July. 417 \nThe addition of nutrient advection also results in a better simulation of the 418 \nseasonal and interannual trends in nutrient concentrations and macrophyte 419 \nbiomasses in SQB. During the strong upwelling season (April-June), horizontal 420 \nnutrient (particularly nitrate) gradients increase as a result of increased nutrient 421 \nconcentrations at the oceanic end due to the advection of upwelled waters 422 \n 20 \n(Camacho-Ibar et al. 2007). Therefore, by increasing the horizontal gradients of 423 \nnitrate in the model during the strong upwelling seasons a stronger advection 424 \nresults in higher nitrate concentrations from May through July in 2004 and 2005 425 \n(Figure 5). However, in spite of the increase in nutrient concentration with the 426 \ninclusion of advection, the simulated values during the upwelling periods are 427 \nbelow the concentrations measured in field samples. This difference between 428 \nmodelled and observed values is more apparent for nitrate in 2005, when 429 \nstronger upwelling in the region promoted higher nitrate concentrations (up to 14 430 \n\u00b5M) at the modelled site. This discrepancy is mostly due to the consumption of 431 \nnitrate by Ulva spp. as indicated by the maximum nitrate concentration (~ 10.5 432 \n\u00b5M) observed in the simulation when the Ulva spp. module is switched-off 433 \n(Figure 5). 434 \nThe difference in the seasonal trend in biomasses between both 435 \nmacrophytes, with Ulva spp. reaching its seasonal maximum in June-July and Z. 436 \nmarina reaching it in September-October reflects the different response to the 437 \nvarious factors controlling their primary production. In the case of seagrasses, 438 \nproduction is frequently regulated by underwater irradiance, temperature and 439 \nenvironmental nutrient availability (Dennison and Alberte 1982; Trancoso et al. 440 \n2005), with underwater light availability being usually the most important 441 \ncontrolling factor (Zimmerman et al. 1987; Cabello-Pasini et al. 2003). By 442 \ncontrast, Ulva spp. production is usually regulated by nitrogen availability and, 443 \ntherefore, uptake rates (Burd and Dunton 2001; Guimaraens et al. 2005). 444 \n 21 \nThe seasonal evolution of Z. marina foliar biomass in our simulations, as 445 \nexpected, shows a maximum in late summer and early autumn of 150 g dry w m-446 \n2\n, when seawater temperature is maxima, and decreases to ~ 70 g dry w m-2 in 447 \nwinter and early spring. The rapid increase in biomass occurs in June-July 448 \n(Figure 6) when light irradiance is at its peak (Figure 3). This is a similar pattern 449 \nto the one described for eelgrass in SQB (Poumian-Tapia and Ibarra-Obando 450 \n1999; Cabello-Pasini et al. 2003; Ibarra-Obando et al. 2007). The interannual 451 \ndifference in our simulations, with higher biomasses observed in 2005, is not due 452 \nto a difference in irradiance but it is likely due to the increased availability of 453 \nnitrate. Ibarra-Obando et al. (2007) speculate that the large interannual variability 454 \nin foliar biomass they observed in Z. marina in SQB, were associated with 455 \nvariations in nutrient availability. ERSEM-GOTM simulations result in a seasonal 456 \ncycle of the Ulva spp. biomass, with values starting to increase in May, reaching 457 \nmaxima of 130 g dry w C m-2 in June-July, and rapidly decreasing by 50 % from 458 \nSeptember through April in response to relatively low nitrate availability (Figure 459 \n6). Ulva spp. is generally sparse in winter and early spring when its growth is 460 \nlikely limited by environmental factors such as light and temperature. The 461 \ninterannual variation in maximum Ulva spp. biomass induced by higher nitrate 462 \nconcentrations in the model agree with the observations by Zertuche-Gonz\u00e1lez 463 \n(pers. comm., 2008) who report higher densities in Ulva spp. beds and higher 464 \nnitrogen content in the plants in June 2005 as compared to May 2004. 465 \nSimulated biomasses in our model are particularly sensitive to light related 466 \nparameters (PAR and light limitation factor) in the case of Z. marina, and to 467 \n 22 \nmaximum nitrate uptake rate variations in the case of Ulva spp. We hypothesized 468 \nthat in SQB water temperature, compared with light, has only a minor control on 469 \nthe seasonal patterns of Z. marina (and Ulva spp.) biomass, as optimal 470 \ntemperature for Z. marina growth has been reported between 15 and 20 \u00b0C 471 \n(Kaldy and Lee 2007), a temperature range typical for the seasonal variation in 472 \nmean daily temperature near the mouth within SQB (data not shown). Cabello-473 \nPasini et al. (2003) estimated the annual variations of Z. marina biomass at three 474 \ncoastal lagoons in Baja California, Mexico, and concluded that irradiance is the 475 \nmost important factor controlling annual variations of biomass and distribution of 476 \nthis seagrass. Kaldy and Lee (2007) reported that temperature is not an 477 \nimportant factor controlling seasonal variations in Z. marina biomass in Yaquina 478 \nBay, Oregon, an estuarine system in the California Current also influenced by 479 \ncoastal upwelling, where temperature ranges from 9 to 13 \u00b0C. 480 \nIn our sensitivity analysis, variations in PAR by \u00b1 30% produce 481 \nconcomitant changes in foliar Z. marina biomass which are more apparent in 482 \nboth maxima (~ 20 - 25 g DW m-2). Ulva spp. also responds to variations in PAR, 483 \nalthough its changes (< 10 g DW m-2) are smaller than for Z. marina (Figure 7). 484 \nThe higher sensitivity of Z. marina to light changes is also evident when the light 485 \nlimitation factor is varied (Figure 8). Whereas foliar Z. marina biomass varies ~ 486 \n15 \u2013 20 g DW m-2 with a \u00b1 30% variation in the light limitation factor (biomass 487 \nincreases as light extinction decreases), Ulva spp. biomass changes ~ 10 g DW 488 \nm-2 (Figure 8). 489 \n 23 \nUnderstanding and predicting through modelling the effect of changes of 490 \nlight availability on Z. marina communities is important to understanding the SQB 491 \necosystem. The annual variation of the biomass and photosynthesis of Z. marina 492 \nin three coastal lagoons along the coast of Baja California, including SQB, have 493 \nbeen related to differences in irradiance, water clarity and temperature (Cabello-494 \nPasini et al. 2003). In general there is an increase of the levels of irradiance and 495 \nof the annual variation in temperature in the lagoons to the south of SQB. The 496 \nsmaller availability of light in SQB causes a latitudinal difference in the spatial 497 \ndistribution of Z. marina, with an increase in biomasses of intertidal meadows in 498 \nthis lagoon (Cabello-Pasini et al. 2003) as seagrass depth limits are strongly 499 \nrelated to the underwater light penetration and light extinction (Duarte et al. 500 \n2007). This distribution makes SQB seagrass meadows particularly sensitive to 501 \nnatural and human induced changes in water quality. Ward et al. (2003) reported 502 \na 34% loss of subtidal seagrass coverage over a 13-yr period apparently due to 503 \nan increase in water turbidity, whereas only a 13% gain was observed in 504 \nintertidal areas. If urban areas and tourism increase around the bay, water clarity 505 \nissues can be a threat to Z. marina communities. For example, sediment 506 \ntransported from cleared land to coastal water can indirectly damage seagrass 507 \nby blocking out the light that it needs to grow. Phytoplankton and epiphytic 508 \nmacroalgae are a common result of excess nutrients delivered to coastal waters; 509 \nincreased amounts of these producers may remove a large percentage of the 510 \nlight that would otherwise have been available for seagrass photosynthesis 511 \n(Ralph et al. 2006). 512 \n 24 \nIn contrast to the seagrass, in our model Ulva spp. is less sensitive to light 513 \navailability and more sensitive to nitrogen availability as is frequently the case in 514 \nupwelling influenced coastal ecosystems (Guimaraens et al. 2005). The 30% 515 \nvariation in the maximum uptake rate of nitrate (i.e. nitrate consumption by the 516 \nplant) results in a variation ~ 10 g DW m-2 of Z. marina shoot biomass and a 517 \nvariation ~ 25 \u2013 35 g DW m-2 of Ulva spp. (Figure 9). Although nitrogen is 518 \ngenerally considered the most limiting nutrient to eelgrass, seagrasses can take 519 \nnitrogen (especially ammonium) and phosphorus from sediment pore water and 520 \nthe water column (mostly nitrate) (Kaldy and Lee 2007). The importance of 521 \nleaves versus roots uptake depends, in part, on nutrient concentrations in the 522 \nwater column. In SQB concentrations of interstitial ammonium are typically > 200 523 \n\u00b5M (unpublished data), a value well above the suggested threshold concentration 524 \nfor nitrogen limitation for seagrass growth (Lee and Dunton 2000). However, our 525 \nsensitivity analysis supports the previous suggestion that interannual variability in 526 \nfoliar biomass in Z. marina observed in our simulations are associated with 527 \nvariations in nitrate availability\/consumption as has been suggested for SQB 528 \n(Ibarra-Obando et al. 2007). 529 \nThe larger sensitivity of Ulva spp. biomass to nitrate uptake in our 530 \nsimulations for SQB (i.e. Ulva spp. biomass changes ~ 30% with a 30% variation 531 \nin the maximum uptake rate whereas Z. marina biomass only varies ~ 10%), is 532 \nconsistent with macroalgae models for other coastal systems (Guimaraens et al. 533 \n2005, Trancoso et al. 2005). In a modelling study of macroalgae in a shallow 534 \ntemperate coastal lagoon, Trancoso et al. (2005) indicate that nitrogen 535 \n 25 \navailability in the system is the most important limiting factor of macroalgae 536 \ngrowth. In turn, their modelling results show a significant control of macroalgae 537 \non dissolved nitrogen concentrations. This was also observed in our study, where 538 \nwithout Ulva spp. nitrate concentrations in the water column increased by ~ 4 \u00b5M 539 \n(Figure 5). This is a substantial variation considering the ~ 3 \u00b5M mean annual 540 \nnitrate concentration at our modelling site. This higher sensitivity of Ulva spp. to 541 \nnitrogen uptake is also consistent with the spatial distribution of Ulva spp. carbon 542 \nstocks within SQB, as higher densities and larger beds are observed near the 543 \nmouth of the lagoon where the influence of nitrate supply from the ocean is larger 544 \nthan at the inner ends (Camacho-Ibar et al. 2007). The larger biomass of Ulva 545 \ntoward the south of the lagoon may additionally be explained by the 546 \naccumulation of floating beds due to the action of NW dominant winds which 547 \ninduce residual surface currents towards the SE (Flores-Vidal 2006). 548 \n 549 \n6. Conclusion 550 \nOur results show that the advection of nutrients added to GOTM 551 \nsignificantly improved the simulation of the seasonal nutrient concentrations, and 552 \nUlva spp. and Z. marina biomasses in SQB, an upwelling influenced coastal 553 \necosystem. 554 \nThe addition of the Z. marina and Ulva spp. modules to ERSEM, a 555 \ncomplex ecosystem model, allowed for the representation of seasonal trends of 556 \nthe biomasses of these macrophytes. However, field data are required to validate 557 \nthe magnitudes of biomasses which may show intense interannual variations. Z. 558 \n 26 \nmarina is particularly sensitive to PAR and the light limitation factor whereas Ulva 559 \nspp. is more sensitive to the maximum uptake rates of nitrate. Consequently, for 560 \na better estimation of seasonal variation of Ulva spp. biomass in SQB, a 561 \ncalibration of maximum uptake rates of nitrate is required. In order to simulate 562 \nmore realistically the dynamics of Z. marina and Ulva spp. biomass in SQB and 563 \nother shallow coastal ecosystems, factors such as shoot loss due to wave action, 564 \ngrazing, self shading and epiphyte fouling, have to be included in the model. 565 \n 566 \nAcknowledgments 567 \n This work was supported by SEP-CONACyT-M\u00e9xico (grant No. 40144) to 568 \nVCI.
