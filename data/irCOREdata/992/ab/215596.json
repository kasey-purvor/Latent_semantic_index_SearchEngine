Some theorists \nexpress concern that this may extend work into times normally reserved for family life, while \nothers argue the Internet can encourage flexible work practices and result in better work life \nbalance.  Focusing on a nationally representative sample of Australian employees, we examine \nthe purpose and timing of Internet use and its role in the interaction between these domains.  \nWe demonstrate that the Internet is being used for personal purposes during work time to a \ngreater extent than for work purposes during non-work time.  Furthermore, we show that use of \nthe Internet for work purposes outside of work hours can assist work family balance. \n \nKeywords \nInternet use, employees, work\/life interaction, spillover \n \n \nA key theme of sociological theories on the social impact of information and communication \ntechnologies (ICTs) is their capacity to reorganise time and space (Castells 2000; Harvey 1990).  \nIn late modern society, our experience of social relations and our exchange of information have \nbecome dis-embedded out of specific places and time contexts and re-embedded elsewhere \n(Giddens 1990).  The Internet, in particular, is identified as a key technology in the collapse of \nthe traditional public\/private distinction (Sheller and Urry 2003).  The geographical separation of \nwork and home, and the division of the day into working hours and free time, are both potentially \nthreatened by ICTs.  However, such theories have run ahead of the available evidence.  This \narticle draws upon a purpose-designed survey of the everyday uses of ICTs to examine these \nclaims and to understand the way that ICTs are becoming integrated into people\u2019s daily lives.  \n \nA key site for the enquiry into temporal and spatial change, and the focus of this paper, is the \ndivision between work and home.  Affordances of the Internet have been credited with the ability \nto blur the boundaries between these two life domains (Nippert-Eng 1995; Wajcman et al. \n2009), potentially changing the dynamic of an increasingly strained relationship (Baxter et al. \n  \n2007; Pocock 2003; Pocock et al. 2007).  Tensions between work and home have often been \nframed in terms of a conflict in the demands on an employees\u2019 time.  The rise of  dual-earner \nhouseholds together with the demise of \u2018standard working hours\u2019 have made the difficulties of \nreconciling time demands of paid work and family life a burning issue (Brannen 2005; Crompton \n2002; Dex and Smith 2002; Lewis 2001; McKie et al. 2002).  The potential for conflict of \nworkplace and household \u2018temporal regimes\u2019 has been explored in Australia, Britain and the \nUnited States (Folbre and Bittman 2004; Hochschild 1997; Pocock 2003; Pocock 2006).  \nHowever, little is known about how employees may be using the Internet to help with this issue. \n \nAn investigation into whether the Internet is playing a role in the weakening of work \/ home \nboundaries is particularly timely given that the process of Internet diffusion is now relatively \nadvanced in Australia.  Nearly three-quarters (73%) of households have Internet access at \nhome (Australian Communications and Media Authority 2008b) and 89% of Australians use the \nInternet daily or weekly, either at home, work or elsewhere (Australian Communications and \nMedia Authority 2008a).  Earlier stages of Internet adoption generated an extensive literature \nabout the potential for a digital divide, how the Internet could facilitate the democratization of \nmedia, affect political participation, encourage creative user-generated content, and enhance \nsocial capital (See review by Castells et al. 2007; DiMaggio et al. 2001; Katz 2003; Wellman \n2001; Willis and Tranter 2006).  Now that the Internet is at a more mature stage of diffusion, it is \nan opportune time to reflect on the relationship between technology and society and examine \nthe specific ways it is being integrated into everyday life.   \n \nWe do this by adopting an STS (science and technology studies) perspective that eschews \ntechnological determinism. This means that we reject the view that people have little control \nover the effects of technology and must largely accept its impact (Bijker et al. 1987; Cockburn \n1992; MacKenzie and Wajcman 1999; Pinch and Bijker 1984; Wajcman 2002).  Rather, STS \n  \nrecognises the role of social factors that contribute to the design, technological content, diffusion \nand adoption of technologies.  Such studies, in common with broad social constructivist \napproaches used in the organisation literature (Luff et al. 2000; Orlikowski 2007; Wajcman \n2006), have repeatedly shown that the way technologies are adopted and used are not \nnecessarily in line with uses intended in their original design, nor are the affordances of \ntechnologies necessarily utilised in the same way by all users.  This conceptualisation of \ntechnology in social life is implicit in our research design.  Using a quantitative approach, we \nseek an understanding of user decisions about the way they incorporate the Internet in their \ndaily lives, specifically in relation to the purpose \u2013 be it for work or personal purposes \u2013 and time \nof use.   \n \nWriters within the sociology of work and organisations have given voice to the anxiety that ICTs, \nincluding the Internet, might extend employees\u2019 work days.  Applications such as email and the \nability to remotely access work files mean that work can often easily be carried out outside of \nthe workplace and outside of work hours (Felstead et al. 2005; Kaufman-Scarborough 2006; \nMazmanian et al. 2005; Towers et al. 2006).  A recent Australian study highlights this and the \ncontradictory nature of the technology\u2019s effects (Williams et al. 2008).  Williams et al. (2008) \nnotes that for some of the study participants, the work extension potential of the Internet was \nperceived as adding flexibility in their lives, while for others it reflected attempts to get through \nhigh workloads and manage personal responsibilities.  Among the published studies, there is no \nnationally representative Australian data quantifying how the Internet may be used for work \npurposes outside of normal work hours, entering what is typically considered personal or family \ntime.  Nor is there any research focusing on how the Internet may be facilitating employees\u2019 \nfamily lives entering work time.  Indeed, data collected on Internet use does not generally detail \nthe purpose of use, that is, whether it is used for work purposes or for personal purposes1.  \n \n  \nSimilarly, debates regarding \u2018spillover\u2019 between work and family life have not fully considered \nthe role of the Internet.  The concept of spillover has been developed to explore the strains \nbetween work and family domains (Crouter 1984; Edwards and Rothbard 2000; Greenhaus and \nBeutell 1985; Zedeck 1992).  It refers to the process whereby the effects of one domain can \ninfluence the other.  These effects can include mood, values, skills or behaviour (Edwards and \nRothbard 2000).  A British study on work to home spillover identified long working hours as the \nmost dominant workplace practice contributing to negative work to home spillover (White et al. \n2003).  While much of the focus has been on negative spillover between work and home, it is \nalso recognised that spillover can be positive, for example self esteem developed through work \ncan have beneficial repercussions on an employee\u2019s home life (e.g. Crouter 1984).  However, \ndespite the apparent relevance of the Internet to these debates, the role of the technology has \nlargely been ignored. \n \nA notable exception is the American research by Chesley (2005).  Her study of dual earner \ncouples considers whether frequent use of the computer (for email and other Internet purposes) \nand mobile phones is linked to greater work family boundary permeability and whether this \npermeability has positive or negative consequences for both home and work.  Evidence that \nICTs increase negative family to work spillover was found for women but not men, while both \nwomen and men experienced increased negative work to family spillover.  These findings, \nhowever, applied to the use of mobile phones, but did not hold for computer based \ntechnologies2.   \n \nIn this paper we build on the work of Chesley and others who contemplate the role of ICTs on \nthe work\/home boundary.  We explore the role Internet use plays in the relationship between \nwork and home for Australian employees in two key ways.  Firstly, we determine the extent of \nInternet use for work purposes and for personal purposes, mapping the spread of this use on a \n  \nweek day and weekend day.  Secondly, we consider the effect of Internet use on the interaction \nbetween work and home life, particularly in relation to work life balance and spillover between \nthe two realms. \n \nData detailing Internet use for work and personal purposes (on a week day and weekend day) is \nunique in Australia and presents a picture of how the Internet may be used to overcome the \ntemporal division between work and non-work time.  We determine the extent to which the \nInternet is being used for work purposes outside of typical work hours (i.e. weekday evenings \nand weekends), and the extent to which the Internet is being used for personal purposes during \ntypical work hours.  In contrast to Chesley\u2019s study (and also that of Towers et al (2006), which \ncollected data on ICT use from Canadian Government workers), we draw on data from a \nnationally representative sample of Australian employees.  A key part of our measure on the \nextent of Internet use is derived from a unique time diary.  Time diary methods allow for the \ncollection of accurate fine-grained information.  In addition to being more reliable than survey \ndata which relies on the memory of respondents (see Bianchi et al. 1996; Gershuny 2003; \nRobinson and Godbey 1997), the time diary uniquely enables us to study the spread of Internet \nuse for work or personal purposes over the course of an average week and weekend day. \n \nThe interaction between work and home life is examined by considering the effects of Internet \nuse on work life balance and on spillover between the two realms.  We analyse data from a \nsurvey question asking about the impact Internet use has on participants\u2019 ability to balance their \nwork and home life.  Then, after examining some associations between pairs of variables, we \nconduct a multivariate analysis of a reduced form of the \u2018family strains and gains scale\u2019 to \ndetermine possible effects of Internet use on employees\u2019 sense of balance between their work \nand home lives (Broom et al. 2006; D'Souza et al. 2005; Strazdins et al. 2006; White et al. \n2003). \n  \n \nIn sum, this article attempts to further develop an understanding of how the Internet is integrated \ninto everyday life.  In particular, we focus on the role Internet use plays in the relationship \nbetween work and home life for Australian employees.  While the technical capaibilites of the \nInternet provide the potential to overcome the temporal and spatial divisions between the two \ndomains, we present empirical findings of the way employees are actually appropriating this \ntechnology.  Data on the extent to which and when employees are using this technology for \nwork and personal purposes is presented.  This highlights whether Internet use in relation to the \ntwo realms does occur in times outside of those typically designated for work and family life.  \nFurther detail on Internet use and its relationship to work and home life is established by \nconsidering whether technology use is connected to work life balance and spillover between the \ntwo domains.   \n \n \nMethods \n \n Data source  \n \nThis article analyses data from a purpose designed survey of individuals aged 15 years and \nolder from Australian households.  The sample, collected during 2007, was recruited by the \ncommercial survey organisation ACNielsen using a composite method of both Internet and \ntelephone interviews. The Internet sample was drawn from the YourVoice Internet Panel. This \npanel is identified using off-line methods (gathering respondents from other face-to-face and \ntelephone surveys).  Panellists were compensated for their time with rewards points that can be \nexchanged against goods and services.  Generally, the characteristics of the panel are similar \nthose of the total on-line population.  Of the 3,469 households contacted by email, 19 percent of \n  \nhouseholds started the survey but failed to complete it.  Other members of the household were \ninvited to participate in the study meaning that households could contribute more than one \nperson.  One thousand, nine hundred and four individuals (from 1,434 households) completed \nthe questionnaire component of the survey.  Of these, 1,255 (from 950 households) completed \nthe diary. \n \nThe off-line sample was recruited by telephone and completed instruments were mailed back to \nACNielsen.  Of the 737 off-line households contacted by telephone eligible to participate, 280 \ncompleted the questionnaire and 77 completed the diary.  While other members of the off-line \nhouseholds were invited to participate in the study, none of the households contributed more \nthan one individual.  \n \nThe final sample was achieved by combining the on-line and off-line samples.  Further, given \nthat the focus of this study is on employees, a sub sample of workers (both full-time and part-\ntime) was selected.  A total of 850 employees (from 658 households) completed the diary.  All \nanalyses are weighted to compensate for the bias associated with the disproportionate sampling \nof Internet and non-Internet users. Weights are based on age, gender and Internet use \n(Australian Bureau of Statistics 2006). \n \nInstruments and measures \n \nThe project employs a combination of novel methods of data collection that generate detailed, \nrepresentative evidence about the usage of the Internet for work and leisure.  The instruments \nused in the study that are analysed for the purposes of this paper are a questionnaire and a \ntime diary. \n \n  \nQuestionnaire items cover topics rarely brought together in a single study of the impact of the \nInternet on work life balance.  Survey subjects responded to questions about the use of the \nInternet, control over hours of work, frequency of stressful working conditions, self-rated time \npressure, and perceived effects of Internet use on work life balance.  \n \nThe unique form of time diary was designed for this project to show when, how often, and in \nwhat activity context, people use the Internet and via which device, be it a computer of a mobile \ndevice.  No other diary collects such detailed data on the way people are using technology.  \nPrevious time diary approaches to studying the use of ICTs have concentrated on capturing ICT \nuse as one activity among many other activities.  Our method assumes that ICT devices are a \nmeans of pursuing particular activities, but are not the activity itself.  For example, \ncommunicating with a friend might be an activity but this can be done face-to-face, or with the \naid of any number of communications applications, including e-mail, social networking sites or \nInternet-based voice or video communications, via a computer of mobile device.  Therefore, the \ndiary asked respondents to indicate which, if any, devices they used for every activity. \n \nThe diary took the form of a hardcopy booklet.  Respondents were required to indicate how they \nspent their time during a 24 hours period by striking a line through appropriate boxes on a grid.  \nThe grid format consisted of pre-coded activities and context information (in rows) and 96 pre-\ncoded 15 minute time intervals (in columns) from 4am one day until that time the next day. The \ntotal time spent working while using the Internet at home, on a diary day, was calculated by \nsumming the time that all three conditions were satisfied. \n \nThe work-family strains and gains scale \n \n  \nA work-family strains and gains scale is used.  This measure is based on a widely adopted \nmulti-item scale with good psychometric properties (Marshall and Barnett 1993).  It is designed \nto capture the transfer of job-related stresses to family well-being and vice versa.  Respondents \nare asked to rate their level of agreement with two pairs of statements designed to measure \nwork to family spillover and family to work spillover.  An average score of both items derives a \nmeasure of both strains and gains.  Again, drawing on the data collected in the time diaries, we \nexplore the effect of the regularity of Internet use on both forms of spillover, while taking into \naccount a range of demographic and job characteristics. \n \nResults \n \nExtent and distribution of Internet use for work and personal purposes \n \nIn order to gauge how Internet use affects the relationship between work and home life, we \nbegin by examining the extent that the Internet is used for work and personal purposes, and the \nspread of this use over week days and weekend days.  To determine the extent of Internet use \nof Australian employees, we present measures of both the frequency of Internet use and the \namount of time spent on the Internet on a typical day.  The frequency measure is provided \nthrough a survey question asking \u2018How often do you use the Internet (including email)\u2019.  The \nseven response categories in diminishing order of frequency of use were: several times a day; \ndaily; several times a week; weekly; monthly; less than once a month; and never.  This question \nallows participants to provide a picture of typical Internet use over a broad time horizon, \ncompared to just a single day\u2019s use captured by the time diary.  To compliment this approach \nand provide a more detailed picture of Internet use, we also draw on time diary data to provide a \nmeasure of time spent using the Internet on a week day and a weekend day.  This measure \nalso specifies the purpose of Internet use, be it for work purposes or non-work purposes3.   \n  \n \nAccording to our survey, 78% of respondents use the Internet at least daily (from any location) \nand 89% used the Internet at least weekly (exactly the same proportion as found independently \nby the Australian Communication and Media Authority (2008a)).  As one might expect, \noccupational differences account for much of the variation in those who frequently use the \nInternet.  Managers and professionals (66%) are nearly twice as likely as other occupational \ngroups (36%) to use the Internet several times a day (p-value< 0.05). \n \nDetails of Internet use on a week day and weekend day are shown in Table 1 below.  Internet \nuse is more common on a week day.  Around two-thirds of respondents use the Internet on a \nweek day and they do so for an average period of two and a quarter hours.  On a weekend day, \napproximately 40% of respondents use the Internet and they do so for an average period of 50 \nminutes.  \n \nTable 1 also considers the purpose of the Internet use (although not the specific activities \ncarried out).  Unsurprisingly, Internet use for work purposes is more likely to occur on a week \nday (42% of respondents) compared with a weekend day (11% of respondents).  The average \namount of time participants spend on the Internet for work purposes is also greater on week \ndays (96 minutes) compared with weekend days (17 minutes).  These findings suggest that the \nInternet does not substantially extend the work week into times normally reserved for leisure \u2013 \nat the weekend.  By contrast, the proportion of respondents using the Internet for personal use \nwas similar on week days (45%) and weekend days (36%).  \n \nIt is also notable that less than half of Australian employees use the Internet for work purposes \non week days.  This figure may seem surprising given that the Internet has been widely \nespoused as an integral tool for work.  However, the Internet does play a major role in the work \n  \nday of approximately half of those who do use the Internet for work purposes on week days.  \nThis group reports using the Internet for work purposes for a period of three hours or more.   \n \n[Table 1 about here] \n \nA crude indication of the extent that the Internet has been integrated into people\u2019s lives can be \ngathered by respondents\u2019 answers to the question \u2018How much would you miss the Internet if it \ndisappeared today?\u2019  Response rates to the five response categories are as follows: I wouldn\u2019t \nmiss it at all because my daily life could proceed as normal (12%); I would miss it sometimes \n(28%); I would miss it often enough that my daily life could not proceed as normal (7%); I would \nmiss it often (21%); I would miss it an extreme amount (33%).  Employees who are more likely \nto use the Internet for work purposes are more likely to report that they would miss the Internet \nan extreme amount (40% of managers and 36% of professionals, compared with 23% of trades \npeople, and 26% of other non-professional occupations).     \n \nThese findings mirror those found in a British study, using a similar question: \u2018If you would lose \nall access to the Internet from tomorrow onwards, would it be a problem for your everyday life, \nwould it make no difference, or would it make your life better?\u2019 (Dutton and Helsper 2007).  The \nBritish study found that nearly two-thirds (64%) of Internet users thought that losing the Internet \nwould cause a problem to their daily life.  This is comparable to the percentage of respondents \nin our survey who report that the loss of the Internet would mean that daily life could not \nproceed as normal, that they would miss the Internet often, or that they would miss the Internet \nan extreme amount. \n \nIn addition to knowing the amount of time people spend on the Internet, understanding when \nthis use takes places can reveal the extent to which the Internet permeates the temporal \n  \nboundary between work and home.  This information is captured by the time diary.  Exploring \nthe temporal spread of Internet use is important as it enables us to look beyond the narrow \nconfines of time spent on the Internet and study the rhythms of daily use.   \n \nFigure 1 shows the frequency of employed people (n=729) using the Internet for work and \npersonal purposes in any given 30 minute period during a week day.  It indicates that work-\nrelated Internet use is mostly confined to standard working hours, rising sharply after 8am and \ndeclining around 5pm, with a small lunchtime dip.  Work-related Internet use falls steeply after \n5pm, trailing away towards zero as midnight approaches.     \n \n[Figure 1 about here] \n \nAs expected, there is a low level of Internet use for personal interests during standard work \nhours (8am-6pm weekdays), with an increase in the evenings.  Common fears of employees \nspending large amounts of time on the Internet for personal purposes during work hours appear \nlargely unwarranted.  It should be noted that the pattern of low levels of Internet use for personal \npurposes is fairly constant throughout standard work hours.  There is no great jump in the level \nof use at lunchtime.  However, this use does not take up much time at work.  It is also notable \nthat the level of Internet use for personal purposes during standard work hours is higher than \nthe level of Internet use for work purposes during typical non-work hours (i.e. weekday evenings \nand weekends).  These patterns of use indicate that the Internet plays a greater role in \nfacilitating boundary permeability in favour of people\u2019s personal life entering the work day, than \nin work life entering into home or family time.  This is a rather novel finding as scholars have \ntended to focus on the Internet\u2019s role in extending the work day, rather than on how the Internet \ncan provide access to family and friends (e.g. Towers et al. 2006). \n \n  \nInternet practices and work and family Interaction \n \nHaving described the general patterns of Internet use, we now turn to a consideration of how \nthis use may affect the interaction of employees\u2019 work and home life.  To begin with, we asked \nemployed survey respondents to rate: \u2018What impact has the use of the Internet (including email) \nhad on your ability to balance your work and home\/family life?\u2019 on a five point scale, ranging \nfrom \u2018increased a lot\u2019 to \u2018decreased a lot\u2019.  Overall, the Internet was perceived as having a \npositive, rather than negative, impact on workers\u2019 ability to balance their work and home lives. \nAlthough 51% report no change, the positive effect is evident in the 41% reporting that the \nInternet increases their ability to find work life balance, as opposed to only 8% who felt that it \nhad the opposite effect.  Managers and professionals (37%) are nearly twice as likely as other \noccupations (22%) to report that use the Internet increases their ability to balance their work and \nfamily life compared to other occupations (p-value< 0.05).  This indicates that people who are \nmore likely to have Internet access at work find the Internet a useful tool for balancing work and \nhome. \n \nAs mentioned previously, the possible spillover effects, beyond the mere extension of working \nhours, were further investigated by conducting a multivariate analysis of a reduced form of the \n\u2018family strains and gains scale\u2019 developed by Marshall and Barnett (1993).  The family strains \nand gains items ask respondents to rate their level of agreement with two pairs of statements \ndesigned to measure two dimensions \u2013 work to family spillover and family to work spillover.  \nWork to family spillover is captured by the statements: \u2018because of my work responsibilities I \nhave missed out on home\/family activities that I would have liked to have taken part in\u2019 and \n\u2018because of my work responsibilities my home\/family time is less enjoyable and more \npressured\u2019.  Family to work spillover is captured by the statements: \u2018because of my home\/family \nresponsibilities I have to turn down work or opportunities I would prefer to take on\u2019 and \u2018because \n  \nof my home\/family responsibilities the time I spend working is less enjoyable and more \npressured\u2019.  To derive a measure of both strains and gains, the average score of both items was \ncalculated. \n \nOf greatest analytic interest is the effect of Internet use on work-family and family-work spillover. \nUsing diary data, we explore the effect of the regularity of Internet use while taking into account \na range of demographic and job characteristics, which previous research has showed to be \nrelated to spillover between the two realms (Broom et al. 2006; D'Souza et al. 2005; Strazdins \net al. 2006; White et al. 2003).  Control variables include age, gender, family type, number of \nchildren and employment status.  Age is categorised into 24 years of age or younger, 25 to 54 \nyears and 55 years and over.  Family type is classified according to whether the household \ncontains a couple or lone parent and whether dependent or non-dependent children are \npresent.  Number of children in the family is a separate variable.  Employment status \ndistinguishes between full-time and part-time work.  Job characteristics cover the employees\u2019 \ndegree of control over start and finish times, the respondent\u2019s rating of work stress, the \nfrequency of working unsocial hours, and preferred working hours. \n \nThe analysis uses hierarchical linear regression that takes into account that multiple persons \ncome from the same household.  The sample is limited to workers, who completed a diary on a \nweek day and whose household comprises related individuals (n=653). \n \nThe results of the two analyses, which examine spillover from work to family and vice versa, are \ngiven in Table 2.  The extent of Internet use for work purposes while at home is significantly \nrelated to work to family spillover (p-value < 0.05).  However, contrary to expectations, the more \ntime an individual spends using the Internet for work purposes while at home, the lower their \nmeasure of work to family spillover.  For every one hour of work-based Internet use carried out \n  \nat home, there is a decrease in the work to family spillover scale of -0.11 after controlling for a \nrange of job characteristics.  This means that the use of the Internet to facilitate the practice of \ntaking work home actually results in better work family balance.  The more individuals did this, \nthe more that they felt that they did not miss out on family activities, making home life more \nenjoyable and less time pressured.  This result is pertinent given that a number of important job \ncharacteristics (such as work stress and working longer than preferred hours), which are \nassociated with negative work to family spillover, have been taken into account (see White et al. \n2003, 191).    \n \nTurning to family to work spillover, which measures the extent to which family or personal affairs \nintrude into the workplace, Internet use for personal purposes while at work is not significantly \nrelated to family to work spillover.  Once again, job characteristics have a significant influence \non family to work spillover, in particular the extent to which employees\u2019 working conditions are \nstressful, whether employees prefer to be working less hours, and whether employees have to \nwork unsociable hours.    \n \n[Table 2 about here] \n \n \nDiscussion and conclusion \n \nICTs are playing a key role in the reorganisation of space and time in late modern society.  This \narticle attempts to move sociological discussion beyond general claims about the potential \neffects of the Internet on spatial and temporal boundaries to examine how the Internet is \n  \nactually being used in everyday life.  The theoretical perspective developed in STS reinforces \nthe need to look beyond what technologies can do to how they are actually being appropriated \nby users.  This requires consideration of the role of users and other social factors in this \nprocess.  \n \nThis article demonstrates that the Internet is a frequently used tool for many employed \nAustralians.  The time dairy data show that, overall, 89% of participants use the Internet weekly.  \nDistinguishing between week and weekend days, 64% of participants use the Internet on an \naverage week day, while 41% of participants use the Internet on an average weekend day.  \nDespite greater overall use of the Internet on week days, it is interesting to note that only 42% of \nemployees use the Internet for work purposes on these days.  This is surprising given the \ncommon perception that the Internet is an integral work tool and that experience of using the \nInternet is vital for gaining employment.  However, of those who do use the Internet for work \npurposes on week days, half do so for a high proportion of their working day (i.e. three hours or \nmore).   \n \nMost of the Internet use for work purposes on a week day occurs during standard working times \nof between 8am and 6pm, while most of the Internet use for personal purposes on week days \ntakes place after 6pm.  Only a small level of Internet use for personal purposes takes place \nduring standard work hours.  It would appear that while some Internet users are taking \nadvantage of affordances of the technology to weaken the spatial and temporal boundary \nbetween work and home by allowing their personal lives into their work day, most are \nmaintaining this socially constructed boundary.  This is an example of employees making \ndecisions about the way they engage with the technology.  Some employees interpret the \nInternet as a tool that may assist them to attend to personal matters while at work.  Others are \n  \nactively restricting their use to work purposes, thereby rejecting the technical capability of the \nInternet to connect work and home. \n \nInternet use does not appear to contribute to the permeability of the work home boundary in the \nother direction.  We found very little evidence of Internet use for work purposes, either on week \ndays in the evenings or on weekends.  This finding contradicts the common fear held by \nsociologists of work and organisations, such as Towers et al (2006) and Williams et al (2008).   \nIt would seem that users are resisting the possibilities that the Internet provides for work to be \ncarried out during times beyond normal work hours and in a greater variety of places.  These \npractices reveal that users are not interpreting the Internet as a work extension technology, \nrather they are maintaining the separation of times typically reserved for home and family.   \n \nThat said, the Internet can potentially affect the boundaries between work and home in other \nways.  We considered how Internet use plays a role in the interaction between the two domains \nby examining its relationship to work life balance, and work to home and home to work spillover.   \n \nAustralian employees are more likely to perceive the Internet as having a positive, rather than a \nnegative, impact on their ability to balance their work and home lives.  As we noted, managers \nand professionals are nearly twice as likely to report that Internet use increases their ability to \nbalance their work and family life compared to other occupations.  They are also nearly twice as \nlikely to use the Internet several times a day, as opposed to those from other occupational \ngroups.  Ironically, it would seem that precisely those groups who use the Internet frequently, \nthat is managers and professionals, are the ones most likely to experience any benefits this \ntechnology can offer in terms of managing work and home life.  \n \n  \nThe multivariate analysis using the family strains and gains scale found that Internet use for \nwork purposes while at home is significantly related to work to family spillover.  However, \nsurprisingly, this finding reflects positive spillover; that is, the more time an employee spends \nusing the Internet for work purposes when at home, the lower the measure of work to family \nspillover.  For every one hour of work based Internet use at home, there is a decrease in the \nwork to family spillover.  This is the case even after controlling for a range of job characteristics \nthat are associated with work to family spillover.  In contrast to researchers\u2019 concerns about the \nnegative potential of the Internet to extend work time into the private sphere at the cost of family \nlife, it appears that employees who are using the Internet for work purposes when at home are \ndoing so on their terms.  The flexibility afforded by the technology is resulting in better work-\nfamily balance for these Internet users.  User Internet practices appear to maintain the integrity \nof family life, while allowing employees to meet the extensive demands of their jobs.  The \nmultivariate analysis demonstrates that it is the general characteristics of jobs, rather than the \nuse of new technologies for work, that is responsible for work to family spillover. \n \nFurthermore, there is no evidence of family to work spillover resulting from the use of the \nInternet for personal purposes while at work.  We found that employees are using the Internet \nfor personal purposes during the work day (8am-6pm weekdays) to a greater extent than using \nthe Internet for work purposes during non-work times.  However, this private use during work \ntime is not proving to be problematic for users.  Once again, it would seem that these users are \nable to manage the technology such that its technical capability to permeate the temporal \ndivision between work and home is controlled. \n \nIn the wake of rapid and extensive diffusion of ICTs, this article provides a timely examination of \nthe actual integration of the Internet into the everyday lives of Australian employees.  Our \nfindings reveal that only a small proportion of employees are taking advantage of the \n  \naffordances of the technology to permeate the temporal and spatial separation between work \nand home, by letting their personal lives into work time and space.  Conversely, the Internet is \nassociated with positive spillover from work to home when employees use the technology for \nwork purposes when at home.  Doing so facilitates increased work life balance for these \nemployees.  It is clear that employees are not simply responding to the Internet in accordance \nwith its technical capabilities to overcome temporal and spatial boundaries.  Instead, they are \nactively making decisions about how they incorporate the technology into to their lives in ways \nthat are beneficial to them (MacKenzie and Wajcman 1999; Orlikowski 2007; Pinch and Bijker \n1984).  Australian employees tend to interpret the Internet as positively contributing to their \nability to manage the work and home life.  Their patterns of use reveal that this is achieved by \nthe limited use of the Internet for personal purposes during work time and its seemingly strategic \nuse by some employees for work purposes outside of standard work times.  This research has \nhighlighted that actual levels of access to the Internet at work will be a factor in the extent the \ntechnology can and will overcome the boundaries between work and home.  The strength of our \nstudy is that it presents robust, nationally representative data on several dimensions of Internet \nuse at work and at home.  It is for future qualitative research to explore in detail how Internet \nusers interpret and give meaning to their Internet use in everyday life.\n                                                          \n1 Two recent Australian reports have explored the activities of users in relation to the technology\u2019s media and \ncreative potential.  A report by Ewing et al. (2008), their first based on the findings of the Australian component of \nthe World Internet Project (http:\/\/www.worldInternetproject.net\/), focuses on the creative industries and the \ncommercial application of the Internet more generally.  An ACMA (2007) report on media and communications in \nAustralian families is concerned with the impact of the Internet and other ICTs on children\u2019s lives. \n2 Chesley\u2019s (2005) measure of frequency of Internet use was collected at two points in time via survey questions \nadministered in telephone interviews.  Each of the couple participants in the sample were required to be working \nand remain partnered during both points of the data collection process.  \n  \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n3 Time diaries have been shown to provide a more accurate measure of time spent on given activities than survey \nquestions when asking about a particular day, see Bianchi et al. (1996), Robinson and Godbey (1997) and Gershuny \n(2003).  Survey questions rely on the memory of participants, whereas when people fill in time diaries they are \nasked in advance to note the time spent on a particular activity and often fill them in during the day. \n \n \n  \nThis work was supported by the Australian Research Council (Grant Number LP0667674).
