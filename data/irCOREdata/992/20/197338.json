Introduction: \nEthics is on the agenda in geography and much time and effort has been spent in recent \nyears exploring a variety of ethical issues and approaches. This tranche of work has \nproliferated in debates surrounding pedagogy (Epprecht, 2004; Hay, 1998; Howitt, \n2005a; Jarosz, 2004; Kearns et al., 1998; Israel and Hay, 2006; Matthews, et al., 1998; \nVujakovic and Bullard, 2001), political commitment and social justice (Beaumont et al., \n2005; Cloke, 2002; Davies, 2006; Hay and Foley, 1998; Valentine, 2005), not to mention \nthe spatial implications of ethical commitments and the general moral progress of the \ndiscipline (Cutchin, 2002; Lee and Smith, 2004; Smith, 2000; 2001). More recently the \ndevelopment of more relational modes of understanding ethics and responsibilities has \nbeen the focus of attention (Barnett, 2005; Brock, 2005; Noxolo et al., submitted; Popke, \n2003; 2006). This broad range of research has resulted in Richards (2004) arguing that \nethics may be the arena that can draw together human and physical geography and this \nhas become most apparent in the arena of research ethics. Here there has been a \nproliferation of work exploring moral obligations to the environment (Armstrong, 2006; \nBaldwin, 2004; Hillman, 2004; Richardson, 2004) and the ethics pertaining to research \namongst specific social groups, such as children, indigenous groups and those with \ndisabilities (Gibson, 2006; Howitt, 2005b; Skelton, 2001; Valentine, 2003). But whilst \nthis interest in research ethics is certainly vibrant, the geographical community has \nremained notably silent about the issue of online research ethics, a form of ethics \nspecifically pertaining to research mediated through the internet using online research \nmethods.  \n \nThis is perhaps surprising given that Warf (2004: 44) proposes that cyberspace is one of \nthe key \u2018cutting-edge\u2019 issues for the geographical community and more so given the \nburgeoning research interest in the impact and implications of new media and \ninformation and communication technologies (ICT) on everyday life (Graham, 2005, and \nmany others). So although there has been a small but growing expansion of geographical \n 4 \nprojects utilising internet mediated research (Barker, 2005; Holdsworth, 2006; Holloway \nand Valentine, 2000; Madge and O\u2019Connor, 2005; O\u2019Lear, 1996; Parr, 2002), little has \nyet been written by geographers about the ethical issues involved in such research\ni\n. But \nthis silence is notable among other social scientists more generally, again surprising \nowing to the increased formal regulation and research governance over the management, \nmonitoring and sanctioning of research ethics in many countries. In the UK, for example, \nthe Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) has recently developed  a \u2018Research \nEthics Framework\u2019 to provide \u2018clear and practical guidelines on the principles and \nprocess of ethics review within UK social science research\u2019 (ESRC, 2005: 27) but this \ndocument completely fails to discuss the ethics associated with internet mediated \nresearch despite the fact that this ethics framework was explicitly developed in response \nto \u2018advances in information and communication technologies\u2019, amongst other issues \n(ESRC, 2005: 27). Similarly, in Canada, the Tri-Council Policy Statement on \u2018Ethical \nConduct for Research involving Humans\u2019 developed by Canada\u2019s three national funding \nagencies also does not yet explicitly address the ethics involved in internet mediated \nresearch (Kitchin, 2003). In the US there are only a few tentative explorations of the \nchallenges that internet mediated research poses to current Institutional Review Board \npractices (Johns et al., 2004; Penden and Flashinski, 2004)\nii\n. \n \nThis paper therefore aims to address this gap in the literature on online research ethics. Its \nfocus is on online research methods (ORM) which include online questionnaires, virtual \ninterviews of various types, virtual ethnographies and online experiments, to mention a \nfew. These have been collectively termed internet mediated research (IMR) or online \nresearch practice (ORP). As Mann and Stewart (2000: 8) so aptly recognise: \u2018Because \nonline research practice is still in its infancy, the critical researcher will be confronted by \nquandaries at almost every point in the research process.\u2019 Thus the debate surrounding \nonline research ethics is a \u2018work in progress\u2019 and the ethical challenges are not simple. \nIndeed, it is clear that many nuances to this debate will evolve as internet mediated \nresearch becomes a more mainstream and sophisticated methodology. \n \n 5 \nThe focus of this paper is to explore and advance the debate surrounding online research \nethics and my argument goes as follows. The use of internet mediated research using \nonline research methods has increased significantly in recent years raising the issue of \nonline research ethics. Obviously, many ethical issues of onsite research are directly \ntranslatable to the online context, but there is also a need for existing ethical principles to \nbe examined in the light of these new virtual research strategies\niii\n.  Five key issues of \nethical conduct are commonly identified in the literature pertaining to online research \nethics: informed consent, confidentiality, privacy, debriefing and netiquette. These are the \nissues that are most commonly discussed in procedural ethical guidelines for online \nresearch\niv\n. However, this paper proposes that given the recent increased formal regulation \nand research governance over research ethics in many countries, it is important that \ndiscussion of such issues continues as an embedded part of professional self-regulation \nand procedural ethical guidelines are used as creative forums for reflexive debate rather \nthan simply being routinely applied by bureaucratic ethics committees. Finally, in \nproblematising the role of procedural online ethical guidelines, the conclusions explore \nhow geographers can contribute to the future debate about online research ethics. \n \n \nII. Exploring online research ethics: \nThere is mixed opinion as to the success of internet mediated research (Hine, 2005; \nIllingworth, 2001; Madge and O\u2019Connor, 2002; Stewart and Williams, 2005). There are, \nhowever, several commonly suggested general advantages of online research. It is \nproposed that it enables the researcher to contact a geographically dispersed population \nand so can be useful in internationalising research without adding costs to the funding \nbody. It is also stated to be useful in contacting groups often difficult to reach, such as the \nless physically mobile (disabled\/in prison\/in hospital etc) or the socially isolated (drug \ndealers\/terminally ill etc) or specific online communities.  Savings in costs have been \nrecommended (for example, costs associated with travel, venue, data entry for \nquestionnaires, transcription of interviews). Moreover, according to Denscombe (2003:  \n51), the quality of responses gained through online research is much the same as \n 6 \nresponses produced by more traditional methods, warranting \u2018guarded optimism\u2019 about \nthe validity of this new methodology.  \n \nBut is there anything special about the online research environment that necessitates the \ndevelopment of a set of ethical guidelines specifically pertaining to the virtual venue? Or \ncan we directly translate ethical principles from onsite research\nv\n? It has been suggested \nthat online research ethics raise many interesting debates as the computer stands \u2018betwixt \nand between\u2019 categories of alive\/not alive, public\/private, published\/non-published, \nwriting\/speech, interpersonal\/mass communication and identified\/anonymous (cf. \nBruckman, 2004; Turkle, 1984). These categories, of course, are not simply dichotomies, \nbut the boundaries between them are blurred and fuzzy. It is the blurring of these \nboundaries that complicates the direct application of onsite ethical practices to online \nresearch. For example, there is still no internationally binding legal agreement as to \nwhether online messages constitute private correspondence or published public texts and \nwhether lurking is a defensible online research technique or if seeking consent is required \nin all virtual venues. As Jones (2004: 179) suggests: \u2018At present for most internet \nresearchers it is likely that gaining access is the least difficult aspect of the research \nprocess\u2026What has become more difficult is determining how to ensure ethical use is \nmade of texts, sounds and pictures that are accessed for study.\u2019  \n \nThus according to Hine (2005: 5): \u2018Online research is marked as a special category in \nwhich the institutionalised understandings of the ethics of research must be re-examined\u2019, \nsupporting the argument that at minimum we do indeed require discussion about the \nethical practices specifically pertaining to the online environment. Indeed, given that \nethics at its simplest is a moral philosophy that involves \u2018\u2026how we systemize, defend \nand recommend ideas about what is right and wrong, given the particular cultural \ncontext\u2019 (Thurlow et al., 2004: 85, emphasis added), it might not be too extreme to \nsuggest that the particular cultural context of the internet might demand some new \nthinking about what constitutes ethical enquiry. Indeed, according to the Association of \nInternet Researchers (AoIR) Ethics Working Committee (quoted by Ess, 2002a: 180), \nonline research can entail greater risk to individual privacy and confidentiality, greater \n 7 \nchallenges to a researcher in gaining informed consent and greater difficulty in \nascertaining participants\u2019 identities. Hewson et al. (2003: 51) concur, proposing that \nensuring that pre-existing ethical standards are properly met online can be more difficult, \ndue to the novel features of the internet environment.  \n \nGiven the relative infancy of internet mediated research, it is timely to review the key \nissues that are emerging in the literature with respect to online research ethics. These are \ninformed consent, confidentiality, privacy, debriefing and netiquette and these are each \ndiscussed in detail below. Some of these issues closely reflect the basic ethical principles \nof onsite research but in other instances, specific issues arise from conducting research \nvia the internet. It must be reiterated that many of the ethical issues discussed below are \nstill under discussion: online research practice is above all else a living process so new \nethical problems and issues continually arise. As Johns et al. (2004: 109) correctly \nobserve, there are still widespread differences of opinion as to what constitutes \nappropriate online ethical conduct\nvi\n.  \n \n \nIII. Informed consent including withdrawal and deception: \nInformed consent in conventional onsite research involves treating the participants of \nsocial research with respect, using clearly easily understood language to inform them of \nthe nature of the research, the time needed to be involved, the methods to be used and the \nway in which any findings might be used, before gaining their consent to take part (cf. \nMann and Stewart, 2000; Vujakovic and Bullard, 2001). Any potential physical, \neconomic or psychological risks (for example, distress, embarrassment, loss of esteem) \nmust be explained and attempts made to militate against these. If this is not possible, the \nresearch should be abandoned for these risks should be no greater than those encountered \nin normal daily activity for the research participants. According to Matthews et al. (1988: \n316) this should also involve \u2018cultural safety\u2019 (cf. Dyck and Kearns, 1995) \u2018\u2026whereby \nthose taking part in a project should not feel threatened or challenged by the researcher \nwho, through inadequate preparation, insensitivity or simple ignorance, may comment \nunwisely on implicit cultural, ethnic or religious beliefs.\u2019 Similarly, any benefits or \n 8 \ncompensation that might be received should be clearly explained, both to the individual \nand also in terms of the \u2018greater social good\u2019. Particular care must be taken with informed \nconsent if the research includes potential vulnerable individuals such as children. \nPermission must be obtained from parents or guardians for individuals under 18 years \nold. Gaining consent should never involve coercion. All participants should be made \naware of the complaints procedure and be able to withdraw from the research at any \npoint.  \n \nClearly these principles should also apply in the online environment. Participants must be \nmade fully aware of the purpose of the research project. Generally written information \nabout the aims of the project, the roles of the participants and any potential risks should \nbe provided, either as an email, on a dedicated website or bulletin board, or by \nconventional mail. If gaining consent virtually, a consent form can be provided as an \nemail attachment or on a project website but getting the participants to sign it may not be \nstraightforward. Ideally the consent form would be downloaded electronically and the \nsigned form returned via surface mail or fax to the researcher. In practice this may \ndiscourage respondents so an alternative consists of including a tick box (\u2018I accept\u2019) on \nan email or web attachment that the respondent can return online to the researcher. \nAlternatively, sending participants a password via email and needing this password to \njoin the research project is an option and this can also ameliorate problems with potential \nhackers. However, without written signed consent any project formally convenes \nEuropean data protection legislation (Mann and Stewart, 2000: 49).  \n \nMoreover, some concerns have been raised about verifying the identity of consenting \nparticipants in internet mediated research. For example, it has been suggested that gaining \ninformed consent online can be more problematic than for onsite research because it is \npotentially easier for participant to deceive the researcher, particularly regarding their \nage. In the virtual anonymous realm, how can the researcher verify the participant\u2019s \nidentity? In practice, however, according Hewson et al. (2003: 52), this type of \nfraudulence is both rare and easily detected. Moreover, these issues are also present in \nonsite research, for example postal questionnaires (Johns et al., 2004: 117). However, this \n 9 \ndoes suggest that particular care must be taken in gaining informed consent when using \ninternet mediated research with minors and here there are several useful case studies to \ndraw on (Bober, 2004; Stern, 2004). Despite this, overall, Bruckman (2002a) concludes \nthat the manner in which to gain consent varies with the nature of the research project. \nShe suggests that consent may be obtained electronically if the risks to subjects are low \nbut otherwise consent must be obtained by a signature on paper returned by surface mail \nor fax.  \n \nThe above points relate largely to gaining consent for online questionnaires. The situation \nwith respect to online interviewing is more straightforward. When using chat facilities or \nconferencing facilities for virtual interviews, it is likely that the interviewees have been \nthrough some sort of process of self-selection and so informed consent can be gained \nduring this process (as detailed above). Indeed, consent should not be left until the actual \ninterview is about to occur as giving consent requires some prior thought from the \nparticipants, the form may take some time to download and time is required for the \nresearcher to receive the written signed form (if considered necessary). \n \nThe ability to withdraw from the research at any time is a further central tenet of \ninformed consent. Withdrawal from an online questionnaire can be facilitated by locating \nan exit button next to the submit button. Withdrawal from a virtual interview can be \nachieved by locating a withdraw button available at all times in the chat window. But \nduring virtual interviews the sudden withdrawal of a participant can be met with \nconfusion: does the interviewee no longer wish to participate? Is there a technical \nproblem with the internet connection? How should the interviewer follow up this \nwithdrawal to find out? How many follow up emails to determine where the participant \nhas gone would be considered spamming or intrusive? These are issues still to be decided \nupon. However, as Johns et al. (2004: 116) suggest, withdrawal is also significant in \nonsite research and infact, a participant may feel freer to withdraw from an online project \nas there are less face-to-face social pressures.  \n \n 10 \nSo while the issue of informed consent shows many similarities to onsite research, there \nare also some differences in the virtual realm. This is a particularly thorny issue regarding \nnot gaining informed consent for participant observation in the online environment. \nDeception involves researchers deliberately concealing the purpose of their study. In \ntheory any research should not involve deception but in practice there is a contested \ndebate over the issue. Some researchers, for example Denzin (1999), argue that postings \non bulleting boards are public so there is no need to proceed without disclosing research \nactivity while Glaser et al. (2002) concede that there are occasions when disclosing \nresearch activity would jeopardise important research aims. For example, in their \nresearch they (Glaser et al., 2002) collected data from chat rooms associated with white \nracist groups. They wanted to discover the circumstances in which individuals advocated \nphysical violence against ethnic groups. They covertly conducted semi-structured \ninterviews with 38 participants through these chat rooms. They did not seek informed \nconsent arguing that revealing the researchers\u2019 identity and purpose of the research would \nhave deterred open expression of views. Glaser et al. (2002) were able to gain approval of \nthe ethics committee at Yale University on the grounds that the respondents\u2019 statements \nwere made in a public form, the deception was necessary for the research to be \nundertaken, and the respondents\u2019 identities were carefully protected.  \n \nSimilarly, Langer and Beckman (2005) argue for the legitimacy of covert internet \nresearch on sensitive topics, suggesting that existing onsite ethical guidelines with regard \nto informed consent may need to be revised. Chen et al. (2004: 164) propose that \n\u2018lurking\u2019 is an important research act prior to gaining informed consent, in order to \nunderstand the topics and tone of exchanges in a mailing list or newsgroup before \nbecoming involved. But although lurking as socialisation into the online culture of a \ngroup may be considered an important prerequisite for research, Chen et al., (2004: 164) \nalso found that moderators and group leaders generally disapproved of lurking as a data \ncollection method, so that observation without participation was generally considered \nunethical research practice. Eysenbach and Till (2001) support this view, contending that \nresearchers \u2018lurking\u2019 in online communities might be perceived as intruders and may in \nfact damage some communities. They therefore suggest that the online researcher must \n 11 \ntread very carefully in order to respect their participants\u2019 lives. But as Hine points out \n(personal communication, November 2005), the issue of deception is often not clear-cut:  \n\u2018A researcher may set out to tell everyone concerned about their research, but as new \nparticipants join a forum and as existing participants forget, the research can effectively \nbecome more covert as time goes on. The issue can be particularly troubling in online \nforums with high turnover, like chat rooms.\u2019 Vigilance regarding informed consent is \ntherefore essential throughout the research process.  \n \nSo clearly informed consent is high on the ethics agenda for online researchers. Overall \nwhile there is still much debate, there is an emerging consensus regarding informed \nconsent. Generally speaking for private or semi-private sources (mail, closed chat rooms) \ninformed consent is considered essential whereas in open access forum (newsgroups, \nbulletin boards), it is suggested that informed consent may not always be essential. Ess \nand the AoIR Ethics Working Committee (2002: 5) recommend that the greater the \nacknowledged publicity of the venue, the less obligation there may be to protect \nindividual privacy and the right to informed consent. A second key issue emerging out of \nthe online ethics debate is that of confidentiality. \n \n \nIV. Confidentiality issues including data security and subject anonymity: \nClearly online research should aim to ensure the confidentiality of participants, as with \nonsite research. However, online research adds additional issues of concern with respect \nto confidentiality. These revolve around whether collected data is securely stored and if \nparticipants\u2019 identities are protected.  \n \nRegarding data security, ethical issues arise in using online research methods. For \nexample, messages posted to a bulletin board or a chat room can be copied and \ndistributed without the knowledge of the writer, and the content of the message easily \naltered. Online questionnaire software may contain undetected bugs or viruses while \nguessable passwords for synchronous interviews might compromise data security. Also, \ndespite efforts to protect anonymity of internet communication, for example though \n 12 \nencryption, according to O\u2019Dochartaigh (2002: 82) it is still possible for security agencies \nand governments to trace most forms of internet communication back to an individual. \nEmails can also be stored by servers for many years. Hackers may also potentially be able \nto access computer files with respondent responses, which is of particular significance if \nconducting studies dealing with sensitive, personal or illegal subjects.  \n \nIn these cases data security can be improved by the use of web-based questionnaires \nrather than email questionnaires, or the respondent can be encouraged to complete the \nquestionnaire on an anonymous machine in a library or internet caf\u00e9 and then print it off \nand post it to the researcher. But this anonymity is clearly not possible in the situation of \na synchronous virtual interview and particular care must be paid regarding confidentiality \nif the researcher uses this virtual method. Encryption can ensure email messages can only \nbe encrypted by the intended recipient but equally it may complicate a research project \nbecause all participants must use email software that shares the same encryption \ncapability and the researcher and participants must have the necessary technology to use \nthe software. Additionally, encryption is illegal in some countries and may be viewed \nsuspiciously by some governments. These issues may all act as a disincentive on \nparticipation levels (Mann and Stewart, 2000: 43). A further general way to increase data \nsecurity is to regularly back up research data and store it in the most secure location \npossible. These problems with data security lead Mann and Stewart (2000: 43) to argue \nthat although researchers can promise confidentiality in the way that they use data, they \ncannot promise that electronic information will not be accessed and used by others. Care \nshould therefore be taken in making promises about confidentiality but equally \nresearchers should be confident that if all reasonable precautions are taken to secure data, \nin most cases of research this should be sufficient. \n \nSubject anonymity is a further issue relating to confidentiality. Prior to the start of the \nonline project the researcher must decide whether the subject\u2019s identity is to be disguised, \nand to what degree. According to Bruckman (2002a), subject confidentiality can range \nfrom no disguise, light disguise, moderate disguise to complete disguise. In no disguise \npseudonyms and real names can be used with the permission of the individual and the \n 13 \nindividual\u2019s claim to copyright over their words is respected. In contrast, complete \ndisguise involves no naming of groups, pseudonyms and other identifying features are \nchanged (such as places, institutions, user names, domain names), verbatim quotes are \nnot used if search mechanisms could link these quotes to the person in question and some \nfalse details might be introduced deliberately so that a subject might not recognize \nthemselves. In this way someone seeking a subject\u2019s identity would be unable to do so. \nClearly the level of disguise depends on the research project, the researcher\u2019s ethical \nphilosophical position and recommendations from ethical committees. In some instances \nfollowing these procedures might ensure more thorough protection of research \nparticipants than is available through face-to-face means (cf. Johns et al. 2004: 119), \nparticularly owing to the added anonymity of the virtual realm. For example, in \nCoomber\u2019s (1997) research with drug dealers, respondents were concerned that they \nmight be traced and be subject to criminal investigation. The researcher was concerned \nthat he might be required by law to hand over email addresses of those who had \ncompleted his survey to the police. In reality this did not occur and Coomber was able to \nprotect the identity of respondents through hiding the origin of responses. \n \nAoIR (Ess and the AoIR Ethics Working Committee, 2002: 7) has produced some \ngeneral guidelines on the issue of informant confidentiality, stressing that this varies with \nthe nature of the research venue. It is suggested that generally if internet participants are \nunderstood as subjects (e.g. chatrooms, MUDs), then a greater sense of confidentiality is \nrequired. If the participants are understood as authors (weblogs, webpages, emails to \nlarge lisservs) then there is less obligation to confidentiality. Indeed, authors of \nweblogs\/webpages may not want subject confidentiality and not to refer to material by \ndirect quotation and specific name would be considered infringement of copyright. Thus \nin order to respect individuals who share their ideas on public lists, the names of these \nparticipants should be properly attributed (cf. Barnes 2004: 212). Bassett and O\u2019Riordan \n(2002) explore this through a case study of an online lesbian activist site, and suggest that \n\u2018protecting\u2019 participants through subject anonymity may well work to reinforce broader \nsocial marginalization of the lesbian community. A third issue that has arisen out of \ndiscussions of online research ethics is that of privacy. \n 14 \nV. Privacy and the public\/private debate: \nAccording to Spinello (2001: 140): \u2018Privacy is under siege as never before thanks to the \npower of digital technology.\u2019 Thus Thurlow et al. (2004) suggest that privacy is the most \nimportant ethical issue for online researchers. On the internet there is no clear agreement \nabout what is public and what is private in \u2018\u2026conception, experience, label or substance\u2019 \n(Waskul and Douglass, 1996, quoted by Bruckman, 2004: 101). This problematisation of \nthe simple binary division between public and private internet space has led to a vibrant \ndebate surrounding privacy issues. For example, is a researcher ethically justified in using \npublicly available information as data for a research project, even if this was provided by \nthe internet user for private consumption? Should a researcher be able to \u2018data mine\u2019 \nfrom newsgroup postings and individual webpages? There is much debate over such \nissues but Hewson et al. (2003: 53) conclude that data that have been made deliberately \nand voluntarily available in the public internet domain (including on the WWW and \nnewsgroups) should be accessible to a researcher providing anonymity is ensured. \nHacking into individual\u2019s files or email accounts is clearly unacceptable.  \n \nBut this issue is not clear-cut. Chen et al.\u2019s (2004) research on using mailing lists and \nnewsgroups for research purposes elicited responses from a variety of \nsensitive\/controversial mailing lists. Many of the responses included animosity towards \nthe \u2018research paparazzi\u2019 in cyberspace. A member of a miscarriage support group for \nexample stated: \u2018We are bereaved, frequently openly grieving, and therefore fragile. Just \nasking questions about our current situation or experience can reopen wounds to a \nsignificant extent\u2019 (quoted in Chen et al., 2004: 160)vii. Another response from a \ndevilbunnies newsgroup reported: \u2018Such endeavors are almost universally seen as an \nintrusion into the world we\u2019ve created\u2026\u2019 (quoted in Chen et al., 2004: 161). Other \nresponses about online researchers were more welcome. For example, the owner of a \nmailing list for women who were second wives responded: \u2018I have a positive feeling \ntowards researchers and journalists- I believe the second wife\/second family situation is a \nserious one and needs as much support\/exposure as it can get\u2019 (quoted in Chen et al., \n2004: 164). So it is important to remember that the specific venue of research is \nimportant when considering the privacy issue. Cyberspace is a differentiated and \n 15 \nheterogeneous space and so privacy issues will vary in different virtual venues (Madge \nand O\u2019Connor, 2005).  \n \nAdditionally, expectations of privacy are perhaps the significant issue and different \nvenues may have different expectations. Barnes (2004: 206) argues that many social \nmessages exchanged over the internet can foster the illusion of privacy because \ncorrespondents do not see the numerous people reading their messages, including lurkers \nto sites, so individuals often believe they are communicating with a small group rather \nthan a large audience.  For example, many people communicating in public chatrooms or \ndiscussion groups perceive their conversations to be taking place in a private setting. In \ncontrast, public lists, such as academic discussion groups, require proper citation to be \ngiven to materials used in their discussions (Barnes, 2004: 220).  So a key issue facing \nthe online researcher is whether the individual or group considers their correspondence to \nbe public or private. Ess and the AoIR Ethics Working Committee (2002: 7) suggest that \nif the participants of the research believe that their communications are made in private, \nor if they are understood as subjects participating in private exchanges via \nchatrooms\/MUDs or MOOs, then there may be a greater obligation for the researcher to \nprotect individual privacy. But if the research focuses on publically accessible archives \nand inter\/actions by authors\/agents are public and performative, (for example e-mail \npostings to large listserves or USENET groups, production of weblogs and home pages), \nthen there may be less obligation to protect individual privacy. Barnes (2004: 219) notes \nthat the situation for discussion lists is complicated- they may be considered both public \nand private and here she cautions that the researcher must respect the specific privacy \nguidelines of the online group. Indeed, many discussion groups now state their privacy or \ncitation policy when you join them and the online researcher should check the welcome \nmessage of public discussion lists for guidelines on how to properly cite email messages. \n \nThe privacy debate has recently moved on with Bakardjieva and Feenberg (2001) arguing \nthat \u2018alienation\u2019 not privacy is the core ethical problem of online research. For these \nresearchers (2001: 236) alienation is the \u2018\u2026appropriation of the products of somebody\u2019s \n 16 \nactions for purposes never intended or foreseen by the actor herself, drawing these \nproducts into a system of relations over which the producer has no knowledge or control.\u2019 \nBerry (2004) explores the issue in more depth, arguing that privacy is infact a misleading \nand confusing concept to apply to the internet, with non-alienation being more \nresourceful in addressing ethical issues. On this basis he argues for the principles of \n\u2018open source ethics\u2019 to be applied in online research which includes a more participatory \nand democratic research method. A further feature pertaining to online research ethics is \nthat of debriefing. \n \n \nVI. Debriefing and feedback procedures: \nOnsite ethical guidelines generally expect the researcher to debrief the participants after \nthe research process. In onsite research this might involve a face-to-face meeting or a \nwritten report to explain the results of the study and to invite comment and queries. At \nthis point the researcher can determine whether the participant has suffered any harm \nfrom the research process and can take measures to address this, if necessary. In internet \nmediated research this debriefing might involve an email to all participants or setting up a \ndedicated website to locate any published materials, both including a contact address and \ninvitation for comment. Whilst there is no guarantee that the participant will read the \nemail or visit the website, lack of participant involvement in the debriefing process is not \nconfined to online research but also takes place in onsite research. This debriefing \nsituation is complicated in cross-national online research projects. Distance is likely to \nrestrict face-to-face debriefing and this may be picked up by ethical committees. Anders \n(2000, quoted by Mann and Stewart, 2000: 55), for example, was required by her ethics \ncommittee to make sure that she could organize counseling in the state and country of her \nresearch participants if necessary. Moreover, particularly in the situation of cross-cultural \nresearch, debriefing must be sensitive to the cultural make up of the online research \nvenue and the cultural values of its participants.  \n \nChen et al. (2004: 171) go further, arguing that this debriefing should also include the \nsharing of research results, so that the online community is made aware of the \n 17 \ninformation that has been gathered from them. This sharing of research results can \npromote more egalitarian research relationships and can result in corrections to the \nresearcher\u2019s analysis and interpretation of data. In this manner, sharing research results \n\u2018repel the feeling of being used by the researcher for selfish gains\u2019 (Chen et al., 2004: \n172). As Breuder (personal communication, 2005) so aptly observes, since the amount of \nonline research conducted is increasing rapidly, often too little is done to build a long-\nterm positive research environment. Many researchers are far more concerned with \n\u2018harvesting\u2019 cheap participants than with providing an equitable research environment. \nThis leads Breuder (personal communication, 2005) to suggest: \u2018Apart from things that \nshould be standard, like a thorough debriefing and the possibility for the participant to \nprovide feedback, one way to go seems to be to provide detailed individual feedback, for \nexample, on questionnaire results. This has its own ethical problems and, unfortunately, \nethics committees at this stage are often reluctant to agree to it. Still, apart from monetary \nreward, it seems to me nearly the only way to achieve what is ethically prescribed: equal \ngains on both sides of the research process.\u2019 This issue clearly requires much greater \nattention and here online researchers have much to learn from the literature on \nparticipatory geographies (Hickey and Mohan, 2004; Kindon, 2003; Pain, 2004). A final \nissue of concern, one more specifically pertaining to the online environment, is that of \nnetiquette.  \n \n \nVII. Netiquette including flaming and online harassment: \nResearch etiquette on the internet requires special consideration, raising some differences \ncompared to etiquette required by more conventional research approaches (Hall et al., \n2004: 243). Netiquette is the term used to describe the code of conduct between those \ncommunicating on the internet. It is concerned with internet courtesy and protocols and is \ndirected at preventing aggressive and insulting behaviour. It includes often unspoken \nrules about what is considered appropriate, polite and respectful behaviour online. \nNetiquette is inevitably flexible, as different types of online venues will have different \nrules and conventions. Some examples of netiquette can be found in Mann and Stewart \n(2000), Rinaldi (1996) and Scheuermann and Taylor (1997). \n 18 \n \nSuch guidelines for netiquette have implications for online researchers. Hewson et al. \n(2003: 116) suggest that netiquette demands that postings to a newsgroup or discussion \nforum should be relevant- but most researchers\u2019 invitations to join a research project will \nnot be relevant to the intended discussion. This raises ethical issues for the online \nresearcher. The best practice is to approach the moderator of the list or newsgroup or \ndiscussion forum directly to get permission for the invitation posting but to be sensitive to \nthe fact that such an invitation may be considered spamming and unacceptable to the \nonline community.  \n \nBased on their research with newsgroups, Hall et al. (2004: 244-247) recognize six \nfurther issues of importance where netiquette is concerned. First, the importance of the \nsubject header used in any posting to a newsgroup, to ensure no misunderstandings \nbetween the researcher and newsgroup members occur. Secondly, self-identification and \nself-presentation of the researcher are critical, as readers will form their evaluations about \nthe credibility of the research and the researcher based on these presentations. A formal \nverifiable means to disclose the identity of the researcher, for example through a link to \nan institutional website, can increase the credibility of the researcher\u2019s claimed identity  \nand shows respect and courtesy to members of the newsgroup (see Madge and O\u2019Connor, \n2002). Thirdly, the researcher must be familiar with the common language used on the \nspecific newsgroup, including jargon, abbreviations, acronyms, emoticons and common \ngrammatical rules. The ability to \u2018speak\u2019 the newsgroup\u2019s \u2018language\u2019 shows respect to the \nrules and conventions of the group. Fourthly, the researcher should always ask \nappropriate questions, not ones that could have been answered by a library or archive \nsearch, and to do this the researcher must acquaint themselves on the subject matter of the \nonline community before asking for help. Fifthly, the specific culture of the newsgroup \nshould be attained through online acclimation or reading FAQs and archives, prior to \n\u2018jumping in\u2019 in order to understand the nuances of group interactions. Finally, the \nresearcher has an obligation to be \u2018up front\u2019 about the purpose, nature, procedures and \nrisks of the research.  \n \n 19 \nIn addition to netiquette, online research also raises issues with respect to flaming and \nonline harassment. Flames are hostile and aggressive interactions online. This can include \nvicious verbal attacks and derogatory, obscene and inappropriate language. Verbal \ndisagreement can escalate to mutual abuse, threats of violence and what has been termed \n\u2018flame wars\u2019. Overall O\u2019Sullivan and Flanigan (2003) suggest that flaming is extremely \ncomplex because the expectations and experiences about what is acceptable and normal \nbehaviour varies between individuals, culture, geographic location and with time. That \nsaid, online researchers must ensure that their research project never incites research \nparticipants to flaming because flaming is not just aggressive and unpleasant but it may \nalso be potentially libelous (although international laws have been slow to catch up with \nthe implications of cyber libel). Moreover, if a researcher acts inappropriately or \nunethically, they may find themselves subject to flaming. \n \nAdditionally, a small minority of people are also involved in systematic sexual, racial or \nhomophobic abuse online. As with offline interactions, such harassment is totally \nunacceptable and online harassment is subject to the same laws as elsewhere, with laws \ncourts having the potential to deal with the matter ultimately (O\u2019Dochartaigh, 2002: 83). \nIn my opinion, the online researcher has an ethical obligation not to collude with online \nharassment for the purpose of the research project. Cyberstalking is also an uncommon \nbut significant (for those victims of it) feature of online interactions. Here, too, the \nresearcher will have to consider several controversial ethical issues. What is the moral \nresponsibility of the researcher to inform victims (and perpetrators) of cyberstalking? \nWhat can a researcher do if they become subject to cyberstalking?  (see Tavani and \nGrodzinsky, 2002, for details).  \n \nThese five issues discussed above have formed the backbone of debates surrounding the \nconduct of online research ethics and they feed into procedural ethical guidelines for \nonline research. There is, however, mixed opinion as to the general utility of such \nprocedural ethical guidelines for research, and this debate is explored below in the light \nof virtual research strategies. \n \n 20 \nVIII. Online ethical guidelines: saviour or menace?: \nThe development of procedural ethical guidelines has been considered important for \nsome social science researchers and forms the backbone of some ethical endeavors. So \naccording to Mitchell and Draper (1982: 3, quoted by Kearns et al., 1998: 298, emphasis \nadded), ethics involves \u2018\u2026the study of standards of right and wrong, or the part of \nscience involving moral conduct, duty and judgment\u2026a concern about explicitly \ndeveloping guidelines to aid in determining appropriate conduct in a given research \n\u2026situation\u2019. Frankel (1989) is in favour of this development of procedural ethical \nguidelines, arguing that a profession acts as a moral community and a code of ethics can \nact as an anchor for that community. DeLorne et al. (2001: 273) agree, suggesting that \ncodes of research ethics have several benefits for research communities and society at \nlarge: they can protect research participants from harm, provide a consistent set of \nexpectations regarding the actions of researchers, encourage ethical behaviour, provide \nguidance to researchers in making decisions and protect researchers against legal and \nmoral problems. Thus according to Hall et al. (2004: 240), procedural ethical guidelines \nare important, for \u2018trial and error\u2019 approaches do not enhance our understanding of online \nethics, nor do they eliminate distress as a result of ethical misconduct.  \n \nHowever, the general purpose of procedural ethical guidelines are not without critics and \ncurrently represents an area of lively deliberation. Hammersley (2006), for example, \nargues that the strict application of ethical guidelines is questionable as disagreements \nover ethical practice are common, owing to differing philosophical positions, varying \nconflicts of interest of different groups within society, because different ethical principles \ncan clash and because ethical guidelines must always be interpreted in context. This \nsuggests that procedural ethical guidelines and increasing institutional regulation can only \nbe considered part of the ethical research process and in reality, practical judgments \nabout ethical decisions rarely amount to the straightforward application of such \nguidelines (Hammersley, 2006: 5). Hay (1998) further calls for the need to repudiate \ninstitutional claims to moral authority and the prescriptive approaches to ethics \ncommonly allied with those claims. In doing so he encourages a move away from \nheteronomous approaches towards a re-personalised ethics which encourages critical \n 21 \nautonomous thought about ethical behaviour and situated reflexivity. This suggests the \nneed to create and support ethically informed practice by researchers (rather than to \nsimply develop procedural ethical guidelines) sensitive to creating paths to justice, \nrespect and beneficence (cf Hay, 1998: 6). Without researcher commitment to ethical \nconduct, no amount of rules, regulation or guidelines will yield ethical practice. In sum, \nprocedural ethical guidelines must presuppose an ethical researcher. However, it is also \nclear that researchers do not work in a vacuum and they are under increasing institutional \npressure to meets the demands of a growing body of ethical regulations in many different \ncountries. Israel and Hay (2006) explore this simultaneous operation of ethical conduct in \npractice and regulatory compliance mediated through institutionally produced procedural \nethical guidelines. This has led, they suggest (2006: 144), to \u2018an adversarial culture\u2019 \nbetween researchers and regulators. Accordingly, they suggest social scientists have to \nnegotiate the competing claims of ethical conduct and regulatory compliance but in doing \nso they urge researchers to engage constructively with the local and national regulatory \nbodies that create procedural ethical guidelines. Israel and Hay (2006) are therefore \nsuggesting that researchers need to have the skills and ethical knowledge to negotiate and \ntransform procedural ethical guidelines with regulatory agencies\/participants and not just \ntake these guidelines on board as internally embedded regulatory mechanisms. \n \nBearing in mind these important critiques of  regulatory ethical procedures, my position \nis that at this moment, it is still worthwhile considering the guidelines for online research \nethics that have been produced to date as they can provide a \u2018baseline\u2019 from which to \nreflect on ethical online praxis and to develop a \u2018re-personalised\u2019 online ethical \nresearcher. This endeavor is particularly important for online researchers for several \nreasons. First, owing to the relatively novel status (about a decade old) of internet \nmediated research, the debate about online ethics is still in its infancy and so some \nbaseline might be useful to online researchers (even if that baseline is continually \ncontested and transformed by them). Secondly, owing to the \u2018cheap and quick\u2019 feature of \nsome internet mediated research strategies, there is genuine concern that the \u2018glowing \nattractiveness\u2019 of internet fieldwork may result in \u2018shoddy cowboy research\u2019 (Dodd, \n1998: 60) and so without any guidelines, ethical misconduct might proliferate. Thirdly, in \n 22 \na time where prescriptive guidelines for onsite research are becoming increasingly \ncommon, there is the risk of the internet becoming a kind of \u2018free for all\u2019 research space, \nwhere the usual rules of confidentiality, privacy and debriefing need not apply.  Finally, \nthe development of ethical guidelines for online research has also been important in the \nprocess of legitimizing internet mediated research as a robust and valid methodology \n(particularly to ethical review bodies).  \n \nMoreover, given that early online researchers showed little common agreement on ethical \nissues (Cavanah, 1999; DeLorme et al., 2001; Elgesem, 1996; Eysenbach and Till, 2001; \nSchrum, 1997; Sharf, 1999; Szabo and Frenkl, 1996), I believe the development of \nguidelines has been an important stage in the online ethics debate. The forum on \u2018The \nEthics of Fair Practice for the Collection of Social Science Data in Cyberspace\u2019 (Thomas, \n1996), for example, illustrates the variety of ethical positions held for online social \nscience research in the early days (see Allen, 1996; Boehlefeld, 1996; King, 1996; Reid, \n1996). However, more recently there have been moves towards a growing consensus as \nto what ethical research practice online might entail (Buchanan, 2004; Ess, 2004; Mann \nand Stewart, 2000) and greater recognition of the similarities between online and onsite \nresearch ethics (Ess, 2002a; Thomas, 2004). These important moves have culminated in \nthe Association of Internet Researchers (Ess and the AoIR Ethics Working Committee, \n2002) making recommendations to inform and support researchers, organisations and \nacademic societies responsible for making decisions about the ethics of internet mediated \nresearch. But their document is very careful to stress ethical pluralism, cross-cultural \nawareness, and guidelines not recipes. \n \nSo although there is an emerging consensus about ethical research practices online, this \nconsensus also holds in tension that such practices are contextual and so must inherently \nbe flexibly applied. This flexibility is essential because of the variety of online research \nmethods available, the great range of research topic investigated and the many different \ndisciplines that can be involved in online research. Moreover, the variety of virtual \nvenues in which internet mediated research can occur and the varying expectations of the \nresearch subjects in those venues will further influence any ethical research practice. As \n 23 \nBailey (2001) correctly observes, research ethics are relational and contextual, suggesting \nthat different online methods and different online venues will produce different research \nrelationships and so online research ethics will vary with methodology as well as virtual \nresearch context. Moreover, it is clear that there are different ethical philosophical \nframeworks (deontological, teleological, virtue etc)\nviii\n so as Ess and the AoIR Ethics \nWorking Committee (2002: 4) correctly observe, there is more than one ethically \ndefensible response to an ethical dilemma: ambiguity, uncertainty and disagreement are \ninevitable. Thus Ess (2002a: 181-184) argues that while we are witnessing a convergence \nin general approaches to online research ethics, this is simultaneously augmented by an \n\u2018ethical pluralism\u2019 in which there is a continuum of legitimate ethical choices available to \nthe online researcher. So while shared agreements on the basic norms and values of \nethical online research are emerging, the actual practice or application of these will \ndepend on precedents of previous researchers, personal ideological ethical position, \ndisciplinary background, online research venue, institutional context, government and \nfunding institutions, ethical committees and specific cultural interpretations and laws.  \n \nThis suggests, therefore, that procedural ethical guidelines can act no more than as part of \na process of ongoing critical debate about internet mediated research, a debate that will \ngo well beyond formal institutional boundaries. Moreover, since there is no one, fixed, \nnormative set of ethics for online research it will be impossible to develop a universally \napplicable set of formalized codes that can be applied as a simplistic template or imprint \nfor research governance purposes. Rather, ethical guidelines might be more fruitfully \nthought of a springboard for critical reflexivity rather than a prescriptive set of rules (cf. \nJohns et al., 2004: 108) which will need to be creatively flexible given the ever changing \nnature of cyberspace. And finally, in problematising the role of online ethical guidelines, \nwhat new avenues of ethical enquiry are suggested for the online researcher? How can \ngeographers contribute to this future debate about online research ethics? \n \n \nIX. Conclusions: A geographers\u2019 agenda for online research ethics: \n 24 \nAccording to (Hine, 2005: 9): \u2018New technologies might\u2026provide an opportunity for \ninterrogating and understanding our methodological commitments. In the moments of \ninnovation and anxiety which surround the research methods there are opportunities for \nreflexivity. Seizing these moments for reflexivity depends, however, on not taking the \nradical capacities of the new technologies for granted, nor treating them as poor \nsubstitutes for a face-to-face gold standard.\u2019 A moment for such reflexivity exists now as \nthe technological artifact of the internet opens up possibilities for a \u2018research ethics \nfrontier\u2019 (Kitchin, 2003: 397). We can mould the contours of this frontier and I would \npropose it is currently an important moment to do so, given recent increased governance \nand research regulation, the growth in ethics committees and institutional review boards \nand the resultant pressures to comply with procedural ethical guidelines. If care is not \ntaken to intervene in the debate, it is possible that ethical guidelines for online research \ncould become routinely applied by bureaucratic ethics committees through institutional \nregulation and training rather than becoming embedded within a culture of scholarship \nand knowledge based on openness and professional accountability (cf  Boyd et al., 2006). \nMy position is that if procedural ethical guidelines for online research are to be of any use \nto researchers and society alike, they must be applied intelligently, reflected upon \nsincerely as part of an ongoing research process and must be considered critically in \ncontext of each specific research project.  \n \nIn sum, given the growth and impact of the internet in recent years, it is both timely and \nof utmost significance that online research ethics are given some consideration. But \nonline research ethics are probably best characterised as new variations of old problems: \nmany of the issues and problems of conventional onsite research still apply in the virtual \nvenue. Issues of power between researcher and researched (who defines the research \nparameters\/who decides on the methods\/who \u2018tells the story\u2019) and structural power \nrelations of the academy (who funds the research and how this alters the research \nagenda\/where and how the findings are published and disseminated\/whose lives are \nchanged by the research) are often similar to conventional onsite research projects. \nAdditionally, as with any research project, it is easy to spout high ideals in theory but \nhard to achieve in practice, as research ethics are complex, messy and negotiated through \n 25 \nthe research process, often with unforeseen consequences and many imperfections \n(Bailey, 2001). As Thomas (2004: 200) so rightfully reminds us \u2018ethical conundrums are \nnever easily solved, and dialogue, critique, constant vigilance, and accountability seem \nfar preferable to more rules and increased oversight.\u2019 It must be remembered too that \nethical issues are often superficially considered by more conventional onsite researchers \nso care must be taken not to have higher expectations for online researchers than we do \nfor onsite researchers!  \n \nBut, in embracing this reflexive moment, I would go further than this too. I wish to \nsuggest that (just at the point of hegemonic incorporation), it is time to unsettle the \nnormativity of procedural ethical guidelines, to question whether internet mediated \nresearch would in practice really get regulated through institutional regulation, and to ask \nwhether more ethical research would actually be the result of increased regulatory \ncontrol? My personal preference would be to promote a more fluid way of thinking \nethics, ethics as process, ethics in motion, ethics as a tapestry weaving its web through a \nconstant process of reiterative dialogue (including dialogue with regulatory bodies) that \nwill in practice produce more ethical researchers and more ethical research (than any set \nof formalized codes ever could!). And in thinking through these threads of an ethical \nonline tapestry, how, specifically, how might a geographers\u2019 agenda for online research \nethics develop? \n \nHere, there is much work to be done but I believe there are three important strands of \nfuture enquiry. First, if online\/offline worlds are mutually constituted, and we carry our \n\u2018real-world\u2019 assumptions, norms and behaviours into cyberspace, then we can clearly \ndraw on onsite ethics for online research practice (see support for this viewpoint from \nBoehlefeld, 1996; Jones, 2004; Thomas, 2004). But, further than this, if there is a \ndialectical relationship between cyberspace and geographical space, then a consideration \nof online ethics may actually challenge conventional onsite understandings of ethics. For \nexample, it begins to challenge the human-subjects paradigm so dominant in the offline \ngeography-ethics nexus, but as Bruckman (2002b) suggests, this is not the only model \nfrom which to consider ethics. Other models, such as the humanities approach, might be \n 26 \nmore relevant for internet mediated research and this approach has the potential to \nradically alter the analysis of ethical enquiry (see Bassett and O\u2019Riordan, 2002 and \nWhite, 2002, for example). As Ess (2002a: 179) explains, the human subjects model \nmakes the analogy of persons (= human subjects) in space. This leads to very different \nethical enquiries than a humanitarian model in which analogies of textuality and persons \nas authors emerges, resulting in a \u2018hybrid model of relational ethics that incorporates text, \nspace and bodies\u2019 (Bassett and O\u2019Riordan, 2002: 233). Internet mediated research may \ntherefore result in rethinking the human-subjects ethical paradigm which presents \nchallenges to conventional onsite researchers too.  \n \nSecondly, geographers have much to contribute in thinking through the dynamic \nspatialities involved in online research ethics. Geographers, with their sensitivities to \nflows and inequalities between places, are well-placed to examine variations in the \ntechnologies of the internet and the ethical situations that rise from its use, showing how \nthese alter in different socio-cultural settings according to varying global relations of \npower, flows of money, ideas and people, locally grounded power relations and often \nsubtle variations (and similarities) in cultural values. Moreover, since the internet has the \npotential to \u2018compress\u2019 physical distance for some, it directly challenges ethical enquiries \nbased on the premise that distance reduces the feeling of responsibility\nix\n. Internet \nmediated research therefore has the potential to challenge the static boundaries of \nthinking geography, collapsing local and global in the ethical field, complicating both \nscale and presence and absence by bringing together face-to-face relationships \nimmediately, therefore potentially heightening responsibilities and giving potential for \nglobal research alliances of knowledge and power. As Popke (2003: 304) argues, \u2018Our \nresponsibility is unconditional, and holds equally to those who are \u2018distant\u2019 as those who \nare located near.\u2019 Through internet mediated research it may then become increasingly \ndifficult to deny interdependence and co-presence and thus a moral responsibility for \nothers (but this does not necessarily mean we will choose to act morally given the \nparochial, self-interest and individualism neo-liberalism encourages). This is particularly \nbecause internet technologies are not all powerful, simple, deterministic or top down \nimpositions but can be used in transgressive, resistive, creative and participatory ways to \n 27 \nexpose and dismantle inequities. So I would propose that an exploration of geographies \nof responsibilities through internet mediated research is a fascinating future subject of \nonline research ethics. \n \nAnd finally, I would like to suggest that geographers are particularly well-placed to seize \nthis reflexive moment to think through how and why online research ethics might be (re) \nimagined through a postcolonial frame. This is important, for as Carey (1997: 57 quoted \nin Christians and Chen, 2004: 21) notes: \u2018For all the vaunted capacity of the computer to \nstore, process and make available information in densities and quantities herefor \nunknown, the pervasive tendency to monopolize knowledge in the professions and data \nbanks continues unabated.\u2019 A new starting point for online research enquiry grounded in \npostcolonial politics and sensitivities may be one way to avoid such monopolisation of \nknowledge. Such a project might involve making transparent how northern research \nmanagement practices feed into a certain notion of online ethics which might support the \nstatus quo of social science as imperialism (Ake, 1979). It might involve thinking through \nhow internet mediated research might be destabalised and provinicialised through a \nreorientation of its ethical terms of reference to encompass a multi-polar world \n(Radcliffe, 2005). It might also move towards a politics of engagement and intervention \nto produce contextualized notions of online ethics which have political accountability and \nopen up spaces for productive alliances (Bessio, 2005). \n \nBut to saturate oneself in postcolonial online ethics, geographers may have to refute the \nuniversalism of Eurocentric based ethical endeavors and to consider whether procedural \nethical guidelines are indicative of a (hidden) ethical colonialism (cf. Pitt 2004, but used \nin a different context by him), or perhaps more accurately, the post-colonial form and \nlegacies\/realisation of colonialism. In other words, geographers can play a role in \nacknowledging that present day internet mediated research is only possible through past \nand ongoing (neo)colonial relationships in which power, prestige, technical infrastructure \nand the ability to define research agendas are linked to the spatial delineation of \ndifference which was so instrumental to colonial projects, and have continued to have \nlasting impacts into the present (Popke, 2003: 311). Thus the myopias of online research \n 28 \noften map onto more familiar geographies and spatialities of inequality and normative \nassumptions and expectations of what ethical practice is, may well have flowed from \ncolonialism into present day ethical guidelines. And in attempting to move beyond this \nethical colonialism geographers may have to listen to and draw on non-western \nphilosophical traditions and indigenous ethics (see for example, NHMRC, 2003, Rose, \n1999 and Smith, 1999 but see Briggs and Sharpe, 2004 for a critique) which will involve \nmaking some serious emotional investments and acute attention to the multi-scaled, \nmulti-faceted and complex nature of ethical enquiry in place. This may also require \nchanges to the neoliberal ideological focus of the academy and what it values (Raghuram \nand Madge, 2006), for example, a shift from a focus on funding, academic publications \nand short term projects towards projects involved in engagement and longitudinal \nprojects to develop long term relationships and commitment to particular people and \nissues (Cloke, 2002): to genuinely move beyond an unequal relationship of academic \nimperialism mediated through particular spatial divisions of labour and mobility of \nneoliberal capitalism. But caution must be taken here too: postcolonial online ethics must \navoid becoming an \u2018academic hobby\u2019 and remain ever attuned to the politics of \u2018giving \nvoice\u2019 by constructing knowledge from the historical, political and methodological \ncircumferences of \u2018the subaltern\u2019 (Chilisa, 2005).  \n \nIn exploring online research ethics through the frame of postcolonial critique, I believe \nthat geographers can \u2018think outside of the ethical box\u2019 (Thomas, 2004: 198) and this in \nmy opinion, is the exciting future for online ethical research enquiries.  \n \n 29 \nAcknowledgements \nThanks to the Media, Technology and Culture Research Group in the Department of \nGeography at the University of Leicester, and to Martin Breuder, Francis Harvey, \nChristine Hine, Pat Noxolo and Parvati Raghuram, for general discussion on online \nresearch ethics. \n 30 \nReferences \nAke, C. 1979: Social science as imperialism: the theory of political development.

Procedural ethics are typically associated with \ncompliance and regulatory institutional mechanisms, whereas ethical conduct refers to \neveryday ethics in practice throughout a research project. Ideally the two would be \nsynonymous but this rarely occurs in practice. \n \nv\n \u2018We\u2019 refers to academic geography researchers, the presumed main audience of the \npaper. \n \nvi\n The ethical discussion below begins with a presumption that researchers seek to follow \nthe Belmont Principles (Department of Health, Education and Welfare, 1979) involving \nfour core values of justice, beneficence, non-maleficence, and respect for others. It \nassumes that researchers do indeed seek to be honest and inclusive (cf. Schrum, 1997: \n120) and this involves from the outset respect for the interests and values of the research \nparticipants: an ethics of care (cf. Capurro and Pingel, 2002). Moreover, this discussion \nalso starts with the presumption of the human subjects ethical model, rooted in medical \nand social science approaches.   \n \nvii\n As an anonymous reviewer pointed out, this paper generally focuses more on research \nwith \u2018vulnerable\u2019 groups. This is a reflection of the online research literature to date. \nHowever, as the reviewer notes, it is important to consider how our approaches to online \nresearch ethics might change if we are dealing with those who are powerful, capable, \nhighly skilled and \u2013 just perhaps \u2013 ruthless, violent or unjust? What might be the place of \nethics in work intended to expose such individuals and organizations and inequities they \nuphold? Much work remains to be done on this subject. \n \nviii\n According to Thomas (1996: 108-109) deontological positions are based on \u2018rule \nfollowing\u2019 and precede from formally specified precepts that guide how we ought to \nbehave whereas teleological (sometimes called consequentialist and associated with \nutilitarianism) perspectives operate from the premise that ethical behaviour is determined \nby the consequences of an act, which on balance will result in the greatest social good, or \nthe least social harm. Ess (2002a: 179, 182) suggests that generally the EU follows \n 43 \n                                                                                                                                                 \ndeontological approaches, whereby the rights of individuals are protected whatever the \nconsequences, whereas the United States broadly follows utilitarian approaches, whereby \npossible benefits gained (e.g. to society) at the cost of compromising those individual \nrights might be considered. Ess (2004: 254) also identifies virtue ethics as classical, \nWestern, feminist and Confucian, emphasising the importance of pursuing human \nexcellence (virtue) in choices and actions.  \n \nix\n  But it may simultaneously have the potential to exacerbate social distance. \n"}
