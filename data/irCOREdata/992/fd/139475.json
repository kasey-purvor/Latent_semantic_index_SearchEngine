Introduction \n \nGarlic (Allium sativum L.), an important bulbous plant, is used mainly as a seasoning for foods, \nand increasingly as an herbal medicine and pesticide in organic farming (Pitman and Burt, \n2001). Garlic can be damaged by a number of soil inhabiting species and\/or storage fungi \n(Stadnik et al., 1994). When Soares and Kurozawa (1998, 1999) examined samples of garlic \nbulbs from Brazil, the most prevalent genera were Fusarium (88.6%), Penicillium (77.1%) and \nAspergillus (9.3%), and the most dominant species was Embellisia allii (Campan.) Simm. (2.5%).  \n \nF. oxysporum f. sp. cepae (Hanz.) Snyder & Hansen can cause basal plate rot, which is \ncharacterized by a firm pinkish brown rot covered with whitish mycelium, and less frequently \nfoliar disease (Schwartz and Mohan, 2006). This occurs wherever alliums such as onion, garlic, \nshallot, chive and leek are cultivated; however it has also been frequently observed on garlic \nbulbs (Crowe et al., 1986; Everts et al., 1985; Matuo et al., 1986). Garlic bulb canker caused by \nE. allii has been reported in many countries including the USA (Simmons, 1971; David, 1991; \nFarr & Rossman, 2009), Canada (Corlett, 1996), Japan (Taniguchi et al., 1994) and Korea (Lee \net al., 2002). E. allii attacks the outer scales of the garlic bulb, producing a black soot that \ncovers the surface during cultivation as well as after storage. In mature bulbs, this disease \naffects their appearance and hence their market value.  \n \nA previous survey conducted in Korea revealed that bulb canker and basal rot disease existed \nnot only on newly harvested bulbs from different cultivation areas but also on polyfilm-wrapped \ncloves sold in the markets (Lee et al., 2002). Previously, Taniguchi et al. (1994) reported that \nthe garlic bulb canker caused by E. allii is a minor disease. However, we have observed that \nlosses due to decay of garlic were occasionally severe. There have been no reports on the \ngrowth and sporulation of E. allii under different environmental conditions. In addition, little \ninformation is available about the co-occurrence of E. allii and F. oxysporum f. sp. cepae on \ngarlic bulbs and the interactions that may occur between those two species during storage. \nDominance and colonization on different substrates may be considerably influenced by \nenvironmental or biological factors such as water activity, niche temperature, and inter-specific \ninteractions (Magan and Lacey, 1984; Lee and Magan, 1999; Lee and Magan, 2000; Magan \nand Aldred, 2007; Giorni et al., 2008). Such information may be critical in understanding the \nconditions that enable individual fungi to become dominant in the garlic niche, especially post-\nharvest.  \n \nThe objectives of this study were to determine (a) the effect of water activity (0.937, 0.971, and \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 3\n0.995 aw) and temperature (20, 25, and 30\u00b0C) on in vitro mycelial growth, sporulation and spore \nsize of E. allii, and F. oxysporum f. sp. cepae, (b) the relative competitiveness of these fungi and \n(c) in situ pathogenicity on garlic.  \n \n2. Materials and methods \n \n2.1. Fungal species \n \nDiseased garlic bulbs were collected directly from cultivation areas or storehouses of Seosan \nand markets of Cheongyang, Suwon, and Daejeon, Korea. Spoilage fungi were isolated from \nbulb cankers and basal rot lesions of stored garlic. Based on morphology and sequence \nanalyses of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of 18S ribosomal DNA, the fungi were \nconfirmed to be E. allii, and F. oxysporum f. sp. cepae, respectively. The molecular \ncharacterization of the strains was performed using previous methods (Lee et al., 2005; Lee et \nal., 2006). When the sequence of the isolates was compared with related species retrieved from \nGenBank, the intra-specific DNA homologies were between 99-100% identical (data not shown). \nAll strains have been deposited in the EML herbarium (Chonnam National University, Gwangju, \nRepublic of Korea) as E. allii HBL-EA01 to HBL-EA03, F. oxysporum f. sp. cepae FO-HBL05 \nand FO-HBL06), respectively.  \n \n2.2. Media \n \nThe basal media were (a) 2% malt extract agar (MEA, Difco) at pH 5.5 and (b) 4% potato \ndextrose agar (PDA, Difco). The water activity (aw) of the basal MEA medium was 0.995, which \nwas modified to 0.937 and 0.971 by using glycerol+ water solutions. MEA + 2% ground garlic \nextract (MEGA) was also used as a semi-natural medium in this study. The aw of media was \nmeasured using a Novasina ICII (Novasina AG, Zurich, Switzerland). \n \n2.3. Effects of water activity and temperature on mycelial growth, sporulation and spore size \n \nStock cultures of test species were grown on MEA at 25\u00b0C and used as inocula. Growth rates of \nE. allii and F. oxysporum f. sp. cepae were determined by transferring mycelial plugs (5 mm in \ndiameter) from the growing margin of stock cultures in Petri dishes (90 x 15 mm in diameter) \ncontaining MEA, PDA and MEGA. After inoculation, plates with the same aw were sealed in \npolyethylene bags and incubated at 20, 25, and 30\u00b0C  in darkness for up to 10 days. Mycelial \ngrowth was recorded periodically by measuring the diameter of the colony in two directions at \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 4\nright angles to each other.  \n \nSpore production was determined after 14 days incubation by placing entire colonies grown on \nmedia into flasks with a measured volume of distilled water. All the experiments were carried out \nwith at least three separate plates per treatment. Five ml of distilled water was added to each \nplate and spores were dislodged from the plates using a soft brush. Using a haemocytometer, \nthe spore length, width, and septation was determined of 30-50 spores for each treatment and \nreplicate (n=3).  \n \n2.4. Interactions between E. allii and F. oxysporum f. sp. cepae \n \nDual culture tests were carried out under different aw and temperature regimes by inoculation of \nthe species (10 mm diameter agar plugs) 4 cm apart. The diameter of the growing colonies was \nmeasured daily as described previously (Magan and Lacey, 1984; Lee and Magan, 1999; Lee \nand Magan, 2000). The macroscopic interactions between mycelia in dual cultures were \nexamined and each species given a score based on mutual intermingling (1-1), mutual \nantagonism (2-2), mutual antagonism at a distance (3-3), dominance of one species upon \ncontact (4-0) and dominance at a distance (5-0) according to Magan and Lacey (1984). An \nIndex of Dominance (ID) was used to measure the ability of a species to dominate under a \nparticular set of treatment conditions. The scores for each species were added to obtain the \noverall ID.  \n \n2.5. In situ virulence test on garlic \n \nThe ability (= in situ virulence) of E. allii and F. oxysporum f.sp. cepae to infect garlic bulbs was \nevaluated under different relative humidities in plastic boxes adjusted to different aw levels. The \nRH in the boxes was adjusted to 0.999 aw (= 99.9% RH), 0.971 (= 97% RH) and 0.937 (= 93.7% \nRH). For inoculation, spores (105\/ml in E. allii and 106\/ml in F. oxysporum f. sp. cepae) were \nprepared and hand sprayed on the garlic bulb cloves (either surface wounded with a sterile \nneedle, or non-wounded). The aw conditions and experimental conditions were as detailed in \nBeecher et al. (2001). Their virulence was determined by the symptom level (+++, very virulent; \n+, slightly virulent, -, not virulent) on garlic at 25\u00b0C after 12 days.  \n \n3. Results \n \n3.1. Effects of water activity and temperature on mycelial growth, sporulation and conidial size \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 5\nFigure 1 shows the effect of aw on growth of E. allii on both a characterized artificial medium and \non that containing garlic. This was faster at 0.995 aw on the control substrate (MEGA without \nglycerol. There was no significant difference in growth of E. allii between the two media. Figure \n2 shows the effect of aw and temperature on growth of two strains of F. oxysporum f. sp. cepae. \nAt 0.995 and 0.971 aw, isolates FO-HBL05 and FO-HBL06 grew faster at 30\u00b0C than at lower \ntemperatures. Regardless of temperatures, the FO-HBL06 isolate was more tolerant of water \nstress (0.937 aw) than FO-HBL05.  \n \nSporulation of E. allii was better on PDA than MEA, especially at a high aw level (0.995 aw) and \nat the lowest temperature tested (20\u00b0C, Fig. 3). Ho wever, almost no sporulation occurred at \n30\u00b0C regardless of media and a w used. Practically no sporulation occurred at 30\u00b0C r egardless of \nmedia used. However, the conidial size E. allii conidia was affected by medium, aw, and \ntemperature (Table 1).  \n \n3.2. Interactions between E. allii and F. oxysporum f. sp. cepae \n \nThere was mutual inhibition between E. allii and F. oxysporum f. sp. cepae strains depending on \nthe environmental conditions and medium. At 0.995 aw, E. allii was inhibited more by strain FO-\nHBL06 than by FO-HBL05 at 25-30\u00b0C in comparison wit h the control. Interaction patterns and \nthe ID values among E. allii and the mean scores of two F. oxysporum f. sp. cepae strains are \nshown in Figure 4. Generally, the two isolates of F. oxysporum f. sp. cepae were more \ncompetitive against E. allii and had a higher ID value.  \n \n3.3. In situ pathogenicity of spoilage pathogens \nTable 2 shows that the relative ability of E. allii and F. oxysporum f. sp. cepae to infect garlic \nbulbs was affected by water activity (=% relative humidity). In situ pathogencity of both \ndecreased when the water availability was reduced (0.937 aw), but F. oxysporum f. sp. cepae \nwas more tolerant than E. allii to water stress. E. allii was unable to infect garlic bulbs when the \nwater availability was 0.937 and 0.971 aw.  \n \n4. Discussion \n \nThe present study has shown that besides Penicillium and Botrytis, decay fungi including E. allii \nand Fusarium species are also associated with the spoilage of garlic bulbs. Both these latter \nspecies have been frequently found with basal rot and clove rot fungus and in garlic bulbs \npacked in bags or stored for long periods at low temperatures. Before and after harvest, the \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\n M\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 6\ngarlic bulbs carry a wide range of fungi as spores or mycelia. These fungi will interact with each \nother and some will become more dominant than others. These interactions between species \nare influenced by many parameters; however, substrate (nutrient), water availability (aw) and \ntemperature are known to be the most important abiotic parameters that determine growth \n(Magan and Aldred, 2007; Pateraki et al., 2007). Interestingly, the ecophysiological \ncharacteristics of E. allii in a garlic bulb niche is important in understanding which spoilage \nfungus can be the dominant invader or how certain other spoilage species can be dominated by \nother interacting fungi. The present results showed that the preferential establishment of F. \noxysporum f. sp. cepae might prevent E. allii or other important spoilage fungi such as \nAspergillus and Penicillium from colonizing the same bulb of garlic. Among the isolates of F. \noxysporum, there were differences in their ability to compete against E. allii. This was supported \nby the overall higher l ID value. \n  \nBased on the virulence test, E. allii was weakly pathogenic in wounded garlic. This is in ore \nagreement with a previous study by Taniguchi et al. (1994). E. allii did not infect garlic bulbs \nunder lowered aw (0.937, 0.971 aw), but only when water was freely available and under cooler \nconditions during longer term storage. Often wrapping and packaging with polyfilms barriers \nallow a buildup of water due to respiration and can promote discoloration and spoilage. F. \noxysporum f. sp. cepae grew fast under warmer conditions. The optimum storage temperature \nfor seed garlic is 10\u00b0C with a humidity of 65-70%. Garlic cloves sprout most rapidly between \n4.5-10\u00b0C and thus prolonged storage at this tempera ture range should be avoided. E. allii was \nmore sensitive to water and temperature stress than the isolates of F. oxysporum f. sp. cepae. \nUntil recently, there have been little statistical data on the economic repercussions of the \ndamage caused to garlic by F. oxysporum f. sp. cepae in Korea, but damage due to unfavorable \nstorage has been reported to be severe (data not shown). F. oxysporum survives indefinitely in \nsoil. Infection occurs through wounds or in the vicinity of old root scars at the base of the bulb. \nThe disease favors soil temperatures in the range of approx. 13 to 32\u00b0C, with optimum \ntemperatures ranging from approx. 26-27\u00b0C. Basal ro t is more prevalent in transplanted onions \nthan in direct-seeded onions (UC IPM Online, 2004). The roots of plants infected early in the \ngrowing season can decay and die or turn yellow and wilt. The bulbs of plants infected later in \nthe season may appear normal, but the inner neck tissue may feel soft and portions or all of the \nbasal plate develop a firm dry rot, turn brown, and die. Under moist conditions, the diseased \nscales can develop white mold (UC IPM Online, 2004).  \n \nThe present study has identified that these two fungi have different ecologically niches in which \nthey are able to cause spoilage in garlic.
