Introduction\nThe development of synthetic materials which mimic biological systems by design or by function\nhas become a hot topic in modern science (Mosbach et al., 1996, Zimmerman et al., 2003, Wulff et\nal., 2006). Among the typical representatives of synthetic receptors are molecularly imprinted\npolymers (MIPs) which possess enormous potential for the development of a new generation of\nstable biomimetic materials (Holthoff et al., 2007). However, the main drawback of this technology\nis the formation of a diverse population of binding sites, ranging from low to high affinity, mainly\ndue to thermodynamic reasons (Wulff et al., 1977).\nNanoparticles are practically always formed during the early stages of MIP synthesis, which is\nperformed using a relatively high percentage of cross-linkers (60 - 90%). Typically, following\ninitiation and primary chain growth, the polymerization reaction proceeds through several stages\n(Figure 1). Small branched polymers are formed by monomer addition from solution (a). Highly\nbranched molecules (b) are then formed during the early stages by intra-molecular reaction of\ngrowing polymer chains and by chain extension due to addition of new monomers or polymer from\nsolution. As reaction progresses, larger chains are formed and more reactive groups are trapped\ninside the molecule, favouring intramolecular cross-linking. At this stage highly cross-linked\nmacromolecular clusters with stable network structure (c) are formed (Li et al., 2004). If the\nreaction is allowed to proceed, then molecular clusters react with each other forming large globules\n(d). Continuing association process together with chain growth will lead to the formation of\ninsoluble polymer (e). Termination of the reaction at stage (c) leads to the formation of soluble\nnanoparticles. This has been achieved in the past by dilution of monomer mixture prior to gelation,\nusing free radical initiators with thermal initiation (Wulff et al., 2006). At this stage however\nreaction progresses very quickly and precise control over the size of particles is difficult to achieve\nwhen using UV initiation, which was used here to prepare the nanoparticles. Better control over the\nreaction kinetics can be attained using slower iniferter-mediated polymerization. However the\nfundamental advantage of using this form of living polymerization, as compared with free radical\npolymerization, lies in the possibility to subsequently re-initiate polymerization by exposure to UV\nradiation, where the polymer nanoparticles will act as a macroinitiator molecule. The terminating\ngroups dissociate to form polymeric radicals (Peppas et al., 2004) which can attack vinyl groups\nresulting in extra polymeric growth or covalent immobilization of the particle on a surface\ncontaining these groups. This simple approach can be used to easily immobilize the nanoparticles\non sensor surfaces or to induce sequential functionalization (e.g. signaling functionality) of the\nparticles, increasing the scope for practical applications of this type of materials. The nanoparticle\napproach can offer a unique solution to the problems frequently encountered in MIP technology\nassociated with the presence of low affinity binding sites. Each MIP microparticle (polymer bead or\nobtained by grinding a monolith) contains many binding sites, with a range of different affinities. If\nhowever we start to shrink particle size, then in theory we should be able to select the ones with\n\u201cgood\u201d binding sites. For this type of material we can use affinity chromatography with\nimmobilised template to capture particles containing a greater number of relatively high affinity\nsites. Here we demonstrate the synthesis of MIP nanoparticles combined with affinity\nchromatography. The product of this process has affinity comparable to that of natural antibodies,\nwhilst allowing for the removal of particles with low affinity.\n2. Materials and Methods\nDue to its length, this section is presented as Supplementary Material.\n3. Results and Discussion\n3.1. Preparation of naoparticles\nFor proof of concept we have chosen a model based on polymers imprinted with 2,4-diamino-6-\nmethyl-1,3,5-triazine, common name acetoguanamine (see Supplementary Material). The affinity\nadsorbent for separation of high affinity nanoparticles was prepared using a polymerisable analogue\nof the template, 2,4-diamino-6-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl-1,3,5-triazine (DMET), see structures on\nFigure 3. Triazines were successfully imprinted before using similar compositions (Muldoon et al.,\n1997, Sergeyeva et al., 1999). Optimal results were obtained using a mixture of two cross-linkers:\nethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) and trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate (TRIM), which\nprovided the right balance of flexibility\/rigidity which is crucially important for the subsequent\nmolecular recognition. Control polymers were prepared in the absence of template. The\nnanoparticles produced were characterized by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) as described\npreviously (Sun et al., 1998) calibrated with polystyrene standards. Under the present conditions\npractically no polymer formation was detected during first 20 s of irradiation (data not shown), with\ngelation (assessed visually) occurring at around 250 s. Typical electron microscopy images of the\nmaterials synthesized for different periods are presented in Figure 1. Maximum yield of polymer\nwith Mw 3-100 kDa was achieved just prior to gelation at 170 s irradiation. The yield of the required\nfraction was relatively low, approximately 3% (w\/w) of the initial mass of monomers. Higher yields\nwere obtained with dilution of the polymerization mixture prior to gelation as reported elswhere\n(Wulff et al., 2006) (up to 99 %), although the method relies on thermal polymerisation, and\nincreased temperature during synthesis can have adverse effects on the molecular recognition ability\nof polymers as demonstrated previously (Piletsky et al., 2002). For that reason UV initiation was\nused to ensure the formation of high affinity binding sites. Also, the use of high monomer\nconcentration (minimum amount of solvent that enabled template dilution) ensures the formation of\nstable monomer-template complexes which in turn should result in high affinity imprints, as\nopposed to precipitation methods which require high dilution (Haupt, 2003). Subsequent\nfractionation of the nanoparticles (both imprinted and blank particles) by size was performed by\nSEC, and four fractions collected, with average apparent molecular weights (Mw) of 10-13 kDa, 60-\n70 kDa, 90-100 kDa and 120 > kDa.\n3.2. Presence of residual template.\nNo amino residues were detected by the sensitive o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) method (Paramas et\nal., 2006) in the purified materials, demonstrating complete removal of the template, which could be\nderivatised and detected via fluorescent emission at 440 nm. In the present system, template could\nbe detected down to 9 \u00d7 10-8 M. Template leaching is a common problem associated with imprinted\npolymers synthesized via bulk polymerization, and it is a considerable obstacle when attempting to\nuse MIPs in systems with very low limits of detection (Olsen et al., 1999; Chassaing et al., 2004).\n3.3. Recognition properties of nanoparticles\nThe affinity of polymer fractions was analysed by affinity chromatography on HPLC mode. The\ntype of affinity material used (porous ethylene glycol dimethacrylate-co-DMET) has random\npolymer branches, some of these will be terminated by a DMET molecule, acting as spacer arms\nbetween the polymer network and the affinity ligand. The highest retention time was found for\nparticles with apparent Mw of 90-100 kDa (15.41 \u00b1 0.43 min), particles with 60-70 and 10-13 kDa\nhad retention times 10.85 \u00b1 0.07 and 9.78 \u00b1 0.12 min respectively. Blank particles with apparent Mw\nof 90-100 kDa were retained for 7.01 \u00b1 0.15 min. The same tests were carried out using a non-\naffinity phase prepared in the absence of the template analogue, where blank and imprinted\nnanoparticles had the same retention time (3.93 \u00b1 0.04 min) showing no variation in non-specific\nbinding. This also confirms that both imprinted and blank particles have the same hydrodynamic\nradius, due to the SEC selection step, so the difference in retention times on the affinity column can\nbe assigned to specific interactions with the immobilised template. Tests were performed in\ntriplicate. As the fraction with 90-100 kDa demonstrated higher affinity it was used in subsequent\ntests, after purification by affinity chromatography (see Supplementary Material). Possibly smaller\nparticles do not have sufficient bulk to accommodate a stable three-dimensional structure of the\nimprints. This also seems to suggest that the high afinity binding sites are located on the periphery,\nor on the exterior polymer layers, as smaller particles have retention times which are closer to that\nof blank particles. Larger nanoparticle fractions (Mw > 120kDa) had lower retention times than the\n90-100 kDa fraction. Possibly these are too bulky to interact properly with the affinity phase, and so\ncannot be properly selected via affinity chromatography. For this reason larger fractions were not\nused on subsequent experiments. Figure 2 demonstrates the efficiency of the affinity\nchromatography in selecting a population of particles with high affinity binding sites. There is a\nlarge fraction of particles with low affinity in the mixture after the SEC step as can be seen on\nFigure 2 on left side. When a high affinity fraction collected from the affinity column is injected\nagain it is clear that the low affinity fractions are not present. For comparison, a chromatogram of\nblank nanoparticles injected on the affinity column after affinity separation is also displayed. The\npeaks present at the beginning of the chromatograms (approx. from 1.5 to 3 min) can be assigned to\nthe presence of nanoparticle clusters due to mechanical entanglement of their three-dimensional\nnetwork as discussed elsewhere (Li et al., 2004). These clusters tend to form in solution and as a\nconsequence, entangled particles might not have their binding sites accessible and so will not be\nretained.\nFurther tests were performed with nanoparticles (size range 90-100 kDa) immobilised onto\npoly(trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate) poly(TRIM) particles by UV irradiation (see\nSupplementary Material). This approach exploits the living nature of the iniferter-prepared\nnanoparticles, which allows easy immobilization of the polymer to surfaces containing vinyl\ngroups. Immobilization phase was synthesized by polymerizing cross-linker for the minimum\namount of time necessary to obtain a rigid material, but still with a large number of unreacted\ndouble bonds. Approximately 36 % of initial double bonds (when compared with liquid TRIM) are\nstill present in the poly(TRIM).\nAs expected, after 5 minutes of UV irradiation of a solution of nanoparticles mixed with the\nimmobilization phase only 32.9 % of the initial amount of nanoparticles remained in solution,\ndecreasing to 11.2 % after 8 minutes of UV exposure, further irradiation did not considerably\ndecrease the amount of nanoparticles in solution. In total, 0.35mg imprinted nanoparticles were\nimmobilised per gram of TRIM polymer. The same procedure was repeated with non-imprinted\nmaterial with similar results (with 11.0 % remaining in solution).\nThe composite material with immobilised nanoparticles offers the possibility of measuring their\nbinding properties in solution using the double reciprocal method (Chianella et al., 2003). This\nmethod was selected as the solvent used in the rebinding experiments was not entirely compatible\nwith techniques such as dialysis, and unspecific adsorption of the template to membranes could also\ninfluence the results. Rebinding experiments were only carried out for the high affinity fraction (ca.\n56 % of the total fraction of particles with 90-100 kDa) as the remaining fractions had retention\ntimes similar to that of the blank material. Binding experiments were carried out for imprinted and\nnon-imprinted nanoparticles. For comparison purposes the same tests were carried out for bulk\nimprinted polymer prepared with the same composition used to synthesise the imprinted\nnanoparticles. Template concentration ranged from 8 nM to 1.5 mM. According to the double\nreciprocal plots the dissociation constant (Kd) for imprinted material and the concentration of\nbinding sites in the immobilised fraction (Bmax) were 6.6 \uf0b4 10-8 M and 8.6 \uf0b4 10-7 mol\/g respectively.\nFor the non-imprinted polymer, Kd and Bmax were 7.9 \uf0b4 10-6 M and 1.0 \uf0b4 10-5 mol\/g respectively.\nFor the imprinted polymer prepared by bulk polymerization Kd and Bmax were 14 \uf0b4 10-6 M and 178\n\uf0b4 10-6 mol\/g. The apparent density of binding sites corresponds to approximately 0.6 binding\nsites\/immobilized imprinted particle, although some binding sites might not be accessible due to the\nimmobilisation. The affinity of the immobilised imprinted nanoparticles is in line with that reported\nfor monoclonal antibodies for atrazine: Kd of 3.87 \u00d7 10 -7 M (Grant et al., 1999) and 9.20 \u00d7 10 -9 M.\n(Kramer, 2002).\nFor the specificity tests the immobilised nanoparticles were incubated with a solution of either\ntemplate or structural analogues (atrazine, metribuzin and simazine) in acetonitrile. The amount of\neach compound adsorbed by the polymer is depicted in Figure 3. Whilst the blank nanoparticles\nshow some preferential binding towards acetoguanamine, this is negligible when compared with the\nimprinted nanoparticles which have clearly higher affinity and specificity.\n4. Conclusions\nIn conclusion, the products synthesized using this approach are a viable and robust alternative to\nnatural receptors, with comparable affinity and specificity, but with much higher stability and ease\nof preparation. The findings reported here might significantly increase the scope and chances for\npractical applications of MIP technology.\nAcknowledgement.
