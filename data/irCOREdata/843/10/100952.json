Experimental techniques have\nimproved to such an extent that the measurement of\nthermodynamic quantities like temperature with a spatial\nresolution on the nanometer scale seems within reach [1\u2013\n4]. These techniques have already been applied for a new\ntype of scanning microscopy, using a temperature sensor\n[5] that shows resolutions below 100 nm.\nTo provide a basis for the interpretation of present day\nand future experiments in this field, it is indispensable to\nclarify the applicability of the concepts of thermodynam-\nics to systems on small length scales. In this context, one\nquestion appears to be particularly important and inter-\nesting: Can temperature be meaningfully defined on\nnanometer length scales?\nThe standard procedure to show that the thermody-\nnamical limit, and therefore temperature, exists is based\non the idea that, as the spatial extension increases, the\nsurface of a region in space grows slower than its volume\n[6]. If the coupling potential is short ranged enough, the\ninteractions between one region and another become neg-\nligible in the limit of infinite size.\nHowever, the full scaling behavior of these interactions\nwith respect to the size of the parts has, to our knowl-\nedge, not been studied in detail yet [7\u20139].\nFor standard applications of thermodynamics this\nmight not be very important since the number of particles\nis typically so large that deviations from infinite systems\nmay safely be neglected. Nevertheless, these differences\ncould become significant as the considered systems ap-\nproach nanoscopic scales. Here it is of special interest to\ndetermine the \u2018\u2018grain size\u2019\u2019 needed to ensure the existence\nof local temperature.\nSince a quantum description becomes imperative at\nnanoscopic scales, the following approach appears to be\nreasonable: Consider a large quantum system, brought\ninto a thermal state via interaction with its environment,0031-9007=04=93(8)=080402(4)$22.50 \uf6d9divide this system into subgroups, and analyze for what\nsubgroup size the concept of temperature is applicable.\nWe adopt here the convention that a local temperature\nexists if the considered part of the system is in a canoni-\ncal state; i.e., the distribution is an exponentially de-\ncaying function of energy characterized by one single\nparameter. This implies that there is a one-to-one map-\nping between temperature and the expectation values of\nthose observables, by which temperature is usually mea-\nsured. After proper calibration, such measurements thus\nall yield the same temperature, contrary to distributions\nwith several parameters. If the distribution were not ex-\nponentially decaying, physical quantities like energy\nwould not have \u2018\u2018sharp\u2019\u2019 values.\nOur results are thus obtained from calculations with\ncanonical ensembles. Approaches based on different en-\nsembles (e.g., microcanonical ones), which are being dis-\ncussed [10], may yield significantly different results.\nIn this Letter we study a chain of identical particles\nwith next neighbor interactions which decomposes into\nNG identical subgroups of n particles each. Assuming that\nthe total system is in a thermal (canonical) state, we\nderive conditions on the interaction strength between\nthe groups and the global temperature which ensure that\nthe state of each group is approximately canonical.\nFinally, we apply these conditions to a harmonic chain\nand calculate the minimal group size nmin, which is found\nto depend on the global temperature and the desired\naccuracy of the local thermodynamical description.\nWe start by defining the Hamiltonian of our chain in\nthe form\nH \u0001X\ni\nHi with Hi \u0001 p\n2\ni\n2m\n\u0004U\u0005qi\u0006 \u0004 V\u0005qi; qi\u00041\u0006; (1)\nwhere the index i labels the particles of mass m, and qi\nand pi are their positions and momenta, respectively.

These fundamental\ncriteria are now applied to a concrete example.\nThermal properties of insulating solids are quite suc-\ncessfully described by harmonic lattice models. We there-\nfore consider as an example a harmonic chain of NG \u0018 n\nsites with periodic boundary conditions.

We divide\nthe chain intoNG groups of n particles each and thus get a\npartition of the type considered above.

Thus, our considerations do not\napply to product states jai, for which all the energy was\nlocated in only one group or only a small number of\ngroups. For NG \u0015 1, the number of such states is vanish-\ningly small compared to the number of all product states.\nTo analyze conditions (13) and (16), we make use of the\ncontinuum or Debye approximation [14], requiring n\u0015 1\n080402-3and a0 \u0017 l, where l \u0001 na0, the length of the chain, is\nfinite.

(22) and (24), the constant\npart in the lhs of (23) satisfies \u00052\u0019=n2\u0006\u0005E0=NG\u0006<\u0004\u0004\u0004\n\u001b\np\n=\u0005 \u0004\u0004\u00042p 0\u0006 \u0003 \u001b=02 \u0017 1, temperature is intensive.\nInserting Eq. (19) into Eq. (22) and (24) one can now\ncalculate the minimal n for given \u001b, 0, \u001a, and T. Figure 1\nshows nmin for 0 \u0001 10 and \u001b \u0001 0:01 given by criterion\n(22) and (24), respectively, as a function of T=\u001a.\nFor high (low) temperatures nmin can thus be estimated\nby\nnmin \u0016\n\b\n20=\u001b for T >\u001a;\n\u000530=2!2\u0006\u0005\u001a=T\u00063 for T <\u001a: (25)\nThe characteristics of Fig. 1 are determined by the energy\ndependence of \"a. The low temperature behavior, in\nparticular, is related to the fact that \"a has a nonzero\nminimal value. This fact does not only appear in the\nharmonic chain but is a general feature of interacting\nquantum particles. The commutator \bH;H0\t is nonzero\nand the ground state of the total system is energetically\nlower than the lowest product state; therefore, \"a is non-\nzero, even at zero temperature [8,15].\nFinally, the minimal length scale on which tempera-\nture exists according to our approach is given by\nlmin \u0001 nmina0; (26)\nwhere a0 is the lattice constant. Temperature measure-\nments with a higher resolution should no longer be inter-\npreted in a standard way.\nLet us conclude with some numerical estimates:\nChoosing the \u2018\u2018accuracy parameters\u2019\u2019 to be 0 \u0001 10\nand \u001b \u0001 0:01, we get for hot iron (T\u0015\u001a\u0016470K,\na0 \u0016 2:5 \u001eA) lmin\u001650\rm, while for carbon (\u001a\u00162230K,\na0 \u0016 1:5 \u001eA) at room temperature (270 K) lmin \u0016 10 \rm.\nThe coarse graining will experimentally be most relevant\nat very low temperatures, where lmin may even become\nmacroscopic. A pertinent example is silicon (\u001a \u0016 645 K,\na0 \u0016 2:4 \u001eA), which has lmin \u0016 10 cm at T \u0016 1 K (again\nwith 0 \u0001 10 and \u001b \u0001 0:01).080402-4In summary, we have considered a linear chain of\nparticles interacting with their nearest neighbors. We\nhave partitioned the chain into identical groups of n\nadjoining particles each. Taking the number of such\ngroups to be very large and assuming the total system\nto be in a thermal state with temperature T we have found\nconditions [Eqs. (13) and (16)], which ensure that each\ngroup is approximately in a thermal state with the same\ntemperature T, implying intensivity. In the quantum re-\ngime, these conditions depend on the temperature T,\ncontrary to the classical case.\nWe have then applied our general method to a harmonic\nchain. Equations (25) and (26) provide a first estimate of\nthe minimal length scale on which intensive temperatures\nexist. This length scale should also constrain the way one\ncan meaningfully define temperature profiles in nonequi-\nlibrium scenarios [16].\nWe thank J. Gemmer, M. Michel, H. Schmidt, M.\nStollsteimer, F.
