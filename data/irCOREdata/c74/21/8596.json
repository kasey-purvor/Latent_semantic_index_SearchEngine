The paper adds value in broadening the existing focus of SHRM and \nHRD on large corporations to engendering the need to also develop good HRD \npractices within emerging and growing SMEs and recognising the important role \nthat they can play in developing an age diverse workforce. \n \nKey Words: Small and medium size enterprises, Strategy Training and \nDevelopment, education, learning, human resource development, diversity, ageing \nemployees, Generation X and Y. \n \n \nIntroduction \nThough theory and practice have long held the clear linkage between strategic human \nresource management (SHRM), human resource development (HRD) and organisational \ncompetitiveness and advantage, extant literature on SHRM and HRD focuses overwhelmingly \non large corporations and multinational enterprises at the expense of small and medium size \nenterprises (SMEs) despite them being the fastest growing segment of the economies of major \nindustrialized nations.  Although thousands of small businesses are established each year only \na small number remain in operation within ten years of their inception (Beaver, 2002). Major \ncontributing factors to the failure of many small firms are a lack of attention given to the \ndevelopment of a robust business plan, goals and objectives, organizing and resourcing for the \nnew venture and development of people assets. Through an examination of key issues in \ntraining, development and education as well as an emerging issues of significance in HRD, \nage diversity management, this paper underscores the essential role for SHRM and HRD in \nSMEs and suggests that only those that take a strategic approach to management and training \nand development of their human resources will profit not only from a competitive position in \ntheir marketplace but also be well placed to adjust to changing and often uncertain influences \nin the business environment. In this paper we take as our core premise the belief that like their \n 2\nmuch larger business counterparts, SMEs will also be advantaged by regarding their human \nresources as the principle asset of their organisation and by closely aligning their HRM and \nHRD policies, procedures and planning with their chosen strategy.  The paper begins with a \nbrief overview of the relationship between HRM, HRD and strategy in SMEs. This is \nfollowed by a critical examination of HRD and SMEs. The importance of age diversity \nmanagement for SMEs is then explored. The paper concludes with an examination of future \ndirections for HRD and SMEs. \n \nHRD Strategy and Small-Medium Enterprises  \nThe increased attention now being paid to HRM and SHRM in SMEs is a comparatively \nrecent phenomenon. Indeed, Anderson (2003) suggests that researchers in HRM have largely \nignored SMEs, even though smaller companies could be fruitful subjects for empirical \ninvestigation because of their increasing numbers and market contexts and not least the \ndiversity in the qualitative aspects of their management practices. Similarly it can be argued \nthat SMEs have often ignored the central value of their human resources as core assets for \nsecuring and maintaining competitive advantage. Partly, this can be accounted for because \nlarge organisations are more likely to have the resources to employ HR specialists \n(Morissette, 1993 and Ng and Maki 1993) or to devote time and resources to implementing \nHRM practices, and many owners and managers of small businesses do not have sufficient \nhuman resource training and knowledge and hence do not implement HRM best practice \nwithin their organisations. These factors result in what can only be viewed as a lack of \nstrategic management of human resources within the majority of SMEs. While there is limited \nresearch on human resource practices in SMEs relative to large corporations (Bartram, 2005), \nthe research that has been done tends to suggest that people management within SMEs is not \nonly less strategic, but also quite different in application (Kinnie et. al., 1999). Moreover, the \n 3\nHRM practices that are utilised in SMEs are generally described as \u2018informal\u2019 (Wilkinson, \n1999) with HRM practices regarded as becoming formal as organisations progress in size \n(Kaman et al, 2001). \n \nWhile heightened exposure to market pressures, SMEs are frequently at a disadvantage \nrelative to their larger counterparts regarding their ability to attract, retain and motivate the \nbest human resources. However, SMEs often enjoy the advantage of greater flexibility and the \npotential to be more innovative and entrepreneurial in their approaches to HRM. Despite \npractical constraints upon SMEs, much of the research that has been undertaken, fails to \naddress how smaller firms may develop and profit from systematic planning and \nimplementation.  Much of the literature that claims to address SMEs and HRM has focused \nheavily on the need for training and development (HRD) of both managers and employees \nand there has been much attention given to the role of the owner-manager in engendering an \norganisational culture consistent with the principles of HRM in its broadest definition.  This \nliterature has focused on the personal capability of the key players in developing the \norganisation and has highlighted the importance of prior experience, occupational \nbackground, training, education and attitudes to change.  Clearly, if smaller firms are to \nmaximise their human resource potential, such organisational learning needs to be generated \nthroughout the range of their HRM activities and clearly tied to broader strategic issues.  \n \nHuman resource development (HRD) encompasses the broad set of activities that improve the \nperformance of individuals and the organisations.  The central notion is that HRD may \ninvolve traditional training, organisational development and career development.  Training \nencompasses the fostering of learning among organisational members.  Education activities \nare designed to improve the overall competence of an employee.  Development goes beyond \n 4\neducation to encompass life-long learning.  Therefore at its most basic, HRD increases \nworkforce competence, skills development and quality, as well as motivation and \ncommitment to the organisation and the development of teams.  At its most sophisticated, \norganisational learning provides employees with skills in responding to change and an \nappreciation for lifelong learning.  Strategic HRD is concerned with linking training and \ndevelopment to organisational objectives and responding to changes in technology and other \nfactors in the external environment (McLagan, 1989).  Reasons why strategic HRD may not \noccur in SMEs include cost, ill-defined or absent strategic objectives, lack of managerial \nsupport for the value of training, neglect of long-term plans and a lack of training-needs \nanalysis (Beaver, 2002).  \n \nKotey and Slade (2005) argue that training in SMEs has been described as informal and on \nthe job, with little or no provision for management development and little systematic \napproach to undertaking a training needs analysis (Marlow and Patton, 1993: Loan-Clarke et \nal., 1999 and MacMahon and Murphy, 1999). Indeed, Kotey and Slade (2005) further suggest \nthat in SMEs training often is perceived as an unaffordable luxury involving not only course \nfees but also the cost of unproductive labour, with owner-managers arguing that training \nresults in highly specialised staff, as opposed to the multi-skilled workforce required in an age \nof high job flexibility (MacMahon and Murphy, 1999). In contrast, however, Hornsby and \nKuratko (1990) earlier reported the use of a variety of training methods in small firms with \non-the-job training being the predominant method. Moreover, in the most micro \norganisations, owner-managers perform or directly supervise most business activities \nthemselves, including HRM and therefore take direct responsibility for employee training and \nthe methods that are employed (Timmons, 1999). The research of Kotey and Slade (2005) \nfound that HRM in small and medium-sized organisations changes with size toward more \n 5\nenunciated and prescribed practices and that these changes begin early in the growth process \nand proceed at a faster rate than during the latter growth phase. Furthermore, the adoption of \nformal HRM practices at the managerial level lags behind that at the operational level in many \nsmaller organisations. \n \n Broadly referring to the integrated use of training and development, organisational \ndevelopment and career development to improve individual, group and organisational \neffectiveness, HRD has altered its direction in recent years from a substantive focus on \ntraining being provided to allow individuals to perform a particular task, to concentrating on \ndeveloping individuals for the future for their own benefit and for the benefit of their \norganisations. Developing future capability is increasingly viewed as integral to individual \nand organisational growth. Further, whereas organisations have traditionally invested most of \ntheir resources in training directed at technical skills, there has been a move towards focusing \nmore on what has been termed \u201csoft stuff\u201d such as interpersonal skills and recognising the \nbreadth and depth of employees\u2019 diversity skills (Bucher, 2000). Further it is possible to note \nsome shift away from an informal, ad hoc direction to HRD in SMEs to a more strategic \napproach. \n \nThe advantage that many smaller firms have over their larger counterparts in terms of HRD, is \ntheir ability to be more innovative and entrepreneurial and respond quickly to the diversity \nthat modern workforces present. Certainly the management of diversity is a complex affair \nthat requires more than simple representation of diverse groups in the workforce but sustained \nefforts by HR practitioners to develop the human capital. The creation of a culture that values \nand appreciates differences requires major, systematic planned change efforts and creating \nsuch transformation depends upon a fundamental change in the thinking of HR managers and \n 6\norganizational leaders (Bowens et. al., 1993 and Thomas and Ely, 1996) \u2013 a situation that \nprovides real challenges but also potentially rewarding opportunities for those SMEs that \navail themselves of such prospects to attain competitive HRM advantage and become  \npreferred employers of choice.   \n \nHRD Practices and SMEs \nIn order to meet the demands of the fast changing work environment which is typically \nassociated with SMEs (Kerr and McDougall, 1998), it is essential that smaller firms ensure \nthat they are able to attract, retain and motivate high quality employees with effective \ntransferable skills through the existence of a strategic training plan and a specific budget for \ntraining (Jameson, 2000). While it cannot be denied that SMEs do not have the time or \nexperience to implement training programs or the army of HRM specialists at their disposal as \nhave large corporations (Vickerstaff, 1992), top performing companies are distinguished by \ntheir higher spending on training and development.  The proportion of the working \npopulation employed in smaller firms, together with the personal and wealth creation \nimplications for individuals in this sector not fulfilling their potential, emphasizes the \nimportance of the creation of company cultures that encourage and value organisational \nlearning, training and skills application (Kerr and McDougall, 1998 and Beaver and Jennings, \n2001).  Moreover, integrating training and development activities into key business decisions \nand activities is crucial.  The benefits of doing so include: increased flexibility from being \nable to transfer people with core skills to different parts of the operation; the prevention of a \nshortage of key management skills; the focus on devising the company\u2019s own methods and \ntechniques of operation which relate to its particular demands and the good atmosphere and \nsatisfaction among people working effectively towards recognizable goals (Kerr and \nMcDougall, 1998). Further, given that small businesses face continual change, much of which \n 7\nis frequently unknowable and unpredictable, the essential challenge to the small business \nowner or manager is learning how to cope with such change (Wyer and Mason, 1998), \ntraining and development and the creation of innovative managers are crucial (Stacey, 1993).   \n \nThere is a wide acceptance that owner-managers and supervisors in SMEs and in particular, \nmicro firms, determine the ethos and strategic direction for the whole company and the \nappropriateness of training (Hendry et. al., 1991 and Jennings et. al., 1996) and hence the \nextent to which training, development and education occurs is very much determined by a \nsmall number of individuals. A further difficulty for small firms is that training that is \nprovided tends to be ad-hoc, ill conceived and occurs in the course of normal routines in the \nabsence of a training-needs analysis (Hendry et. al., 1995 and Beaver et al, 1998) and various \nkinds of subjective assessments are used by owner-managers of small businesses to assess the \nvalue of workforce training informally (Jameson, 2000).  Moreover, while the proximity of \nowner-managers to employees may make informality viable in the smallest firms, as the \nbusiness grows flexible, holistic processes of learning and the informal approach to staff \ndevelopment may become inadequate.  As Thomson and Mabey (cited in Kerr and \nMcDougall, 1998) note, it is important that learning and development strategies employed are \nones that nurture the creative solutions, personal and intuitive insights, networking and \nemphasis in effectiveness and short-term realism which are important to small firms but are \nsufficiently measurable to allow for potential growth.  Further, as Jameson (2000) argues, \nwhether or not an organisation is in a state of growth can affect attitudes towards and \nparticipation in, training. Thus, an expanding organisation will have managers more disposed \ntowards offering training and development employees more disposed towards engaging in \nsuch training and education programs. \n \n 8\nTraining, development and education: some suggestions for SMEs \nSmall businesses overwhelmingly use on-the-job training (OJT) because of its low cost and \ntheir preponderance to use ad-hoc training, where provided.  While OJT has the benefit of \nmaximizing transfer of knowledge, it is also deficient in that the supervisor may not be an \nexpert trainer and evaluation of effectiveness is much more difficult.  For SMEs to utilize \nexternal trainers in-house would go some way towards reducing the problems associated with \nOJT\u2019s lack of evaluation analysis and would not prove as cost-intensive as off-the-job \ntraining.  Job instruction training and apprenticeships are the most common forms of OJT in \nsmall firms.  Off-the-job training is more costly for smaller companies and can be difficult to \norganise, but it also offers expert training, minimal interruptions to daily work and can be \nquite efficient for small companies if they participate in \u2018central\u2019 courses.  Where this method \nis utilised by small companies it tends to be limited to seminars and classroom teaching rather \nthan the potentially more useful simulations and programmed instructions.  \n \nSelf-education of employees is rarely supported by SMEs because of financial constraints and \nthe more advanced forms of training characteristic of organisational learning that promote \nlife-long learning are also very rarely utilised either.  Further, management development is \noften neglected in SMEs.  Given that the organisational culture of a small firm often reflects \nthe motivations, attitudes, values and abilities of the owner-manager (Smallbone and Wyer \n1994 and Beaver, 2002), exposure to training and development would ensure that owner-\nmanagers and managers in small businesses are provided with some of the requisite skills for \ncoping with the change demands placed on modern organisations.  Moreover, the \ndevelopment of managers may contribute to organisational learning through improvements to \norganisational practices being embedded in the organisation and becoming part of \norganisational culture through transition from one generation of employees to the next. \n 9\n \nIt is generally argued in the literature that there is a lack of clarity as to why some SMEs \nadopt a strategic approach to HRD, placing emphasis on integrating their learning activities \nwith their business strategy, on regularly identifying and responding to learning needs, and \nreviewing such activities in the light of the business plan, while other SMEs do not (Kerr and \nMcDougall, 1998). It is clear the implementation difficulties facing those that do not adopt a \nstrategic approach to HRD include budgetary constraints, lack of detailed pre-planning and \ninsufficient HR planning integration with overall strategic business plans (or absence of a \nstrategic business plan). Moreover, Banfield et al., (1996) argue that small businesses suffer \nfrom lack of personal and job flexibility, lack of clarity of job roles, lack of coordination as a \nresult of breakdowns in personal relations, absence of teamwork and shared responsibilities \nand individual rather than company perspectives. Yet, despite these deficiencies the \nimplications of a lack of strategic HRD in SMEs are more far-reaching than not meeting \nexistent organisational needs. If SMEs are not prepared to address these internal constraints in \norder to meet competitiveness in the external environment, they will have not only individual \nbut also and organizational ineffectiveness in the long-term.  Moreover, not paying attention \nto strategic HRD in the short-term translates into a lack of career pathing and succession \nplanning and problems in attracting and retaining key human assets in the long-term. In order \nto improve HRD competence, SMEs need to ensure that initiatives fit with a broader strategic \nplan for the organisation and entail diagnoses of problems, a program of action and evaluation \nwithin the context of awareness of and systematic analysis of training and development needs, \nand consciousness of the areas in which SMEs have strategic HRD advantages.  \n \nWorkforce Diversity Management: Challenges and Opportunities in HRD for SMEs \n 10\nAs modern organisations have grappled with delineating the roles and responsibilities of \nindividuals within HRM departments, they have also confronted the demands of managing \nincreasingly diverse workplaces. The people managers within organisations have faced the \nchallenge of needing to provide more flexible working conditions to accommodate both the \nwork\/family demands of all employees, and the cultural requirements of ethnically diverse \nworkplaces as well as being responsive to integrating into the workforce people with \nintellectual and physical disabilities. While it may be argued by some that smaller firms are \nnot as concerned with implementing pro-diversity practices due to their frequent nepotistic \nhiring practices, close proximity to their employees, their size and lesser unionisation, not \nonly are SMEs just as obligated to comply with current legislation as are large corporations \nbut they also present greater flexibility for adaptation given the very nature of their \nmanagement processes. Jennings and Beaver (1995) have suggested that management in \nsmaller firms is primarily adaptive in manipulating a smaller amount of resources than is at \nhand for larger corporations and utilizing these resources to short-term advantage. While the \nsmaller organisation cannot predict the operating environment it does learn to respond quickly \nto changing demands of that business environment. Though lacking the resources of large \ncorporations to develop affirmative action policies, the smaller organisation may, however, \nutilize its flexibility to take short- and long-term advantage of the strengths offered by diverse \nsectors of the workforce. \n \nDiversity issues confronting organisations include the obvious legislative requirements of \nequal employment opportunity and anti-discrimination as well as concerns for tolerance of \nindividual difference, communicating with and motivating ethnically diverse populations, \nmanaging workers with family responsibilities, conflict resolution amongst diverse \nworkforces, managing older workers, managing younger workers,  managing career paths \n 11\ndiversely, and managing diverse teams.  Working with and managing diversity is about \nensuring the development of the human capital (the skills, education, training, abilities and \nexperience possessed by individuals) of all employees. Organisations that fail to appreciate \nthis diversity in their workplaces can intensify the likelihood of misunderstandings occurring \nand potentially miss opportunities to capitalize on the breadth of perspective and experience \nsuch human capital diversity offers (Steane, 2001). As the employee context becomes more \nturbulent and the workforce structure more diverse, there will be greater demands on HR \nmanagers to assist with transition to new organizational cultures that are reflective of the \nchanging demographics of their workplaces. As more and more of the prescriptive work of \nHRM is contracted out to specialist agencies (Evans, et al, 2002), the role for HR within \norganisations will involve a greater role in building trust and networks within the workplace \nand organisation and shaping the strategic focus of the organisations. Moreover, HR managers \ncan be expected to deal more with issues of HRD, such as developing team-oriented work \nsystems that optimize generational differences, managing increasing workforce diversity and \nfacilitating cultural change. Organisations that capitalize on managing diversity better position \nthemselves for competitive advantage by being a preferred employer of choice amongst the \nworkforce.  \n \nThough considerable discussion has been devoted in the academic literature and popular press \non managing cultural and gender diversity, significantly less attention has been focused on \nhow to manage the youngest and oldest echelons within organisations \u2013 the ageing workforce \n(aged 45 plus) that is highly experienced, and Generation X (late 20s to early 40s) and \nGeneration Y (through to mid 20s) that are highly educated and technologically literate. Such \ndiverse groups may provide key developmental opportunities for SMEs, which have been \nfound to achieve competitive advantaged from utilization of workforce diversity \n 12\n(Gudmundson and Hartenian, 2000).  Smaller businesses can benefit from employing older \nworkers who may not be as in demand by larger corporations and profit from being able to \naccess these experienced workers who do not require as much training as younger employees \nbut whom will often accept lower wages because of their lesser labour market position. While \nthe younger employers often demand high wages because of their labour mobility and \nnecessitate investment in training and development, they offer the smaller business and \nelement of entrepreneurship and new ideas and the potential for business growth. Taken \ntogether these polar ends of the age spectrum provide SMEs with both cost advantages and \ngrowth potential. The smaller firm that is conscious of the need to marry its HRD strategy \nwith overall business strategy, may well see value in investing its training and development \ndollars in maximizing the benefits of both the ageing workforce and Generations X and Y. \nOlder Employees and Baby Boomers \nThough the average overall age of the workforce is increasing as a result of people starting \nwork later, the age at which people are retiring from work in the industrialized world is \ndeclining. Increasingly organisations need to recognize the need to retain these older skilled, \nexperienced people in productive employment and to manage them effectively. While \norganisations may want to manage out poor performing older employees, they also need to \navoid loss of skills and knowledge through unwanted attrition. Large organisations have \nshown a readiness to lose skills of older workers due to a willingness to focus on employing \nprimarily younger, recently tertiary-qualified employers who lack practical experience. While \nemployers tend to regard older employees as being more loyal to organisations there also \nappears to be some in-built ageism in which it is assumed that older workers are in poorer \nhealth, more resistant to change, less creative, less interested in technology and less trainable \n(Taylor and Walker, 1994). In many cases the older worker will be considered first for \nredundancy as their pay structure means that they earn more than younger employees. The \n 13\nyounger people not only cost less but are also regarded as more trainable because they are \n\u2018blank slates\u2019. Thus, organisations wanting to downsize have found it beneficial to negotiate \nearly retirement for those nearing the usual retirement age (Rickard, 1999). \n \nThe choices made by many large organizations place SMEs in an ideal position to capitalize \non the development, retraining and retaining skilled, ageing employees. Providing phased \nretirement plans, moving some older workers to part-time work, developing them as small-\nbusiness owners and creating more flexible work conditions, are just some of the ways in \nwhich organisations can save the costs of hiring and training new employees while \nmaintaining older workers\u2019 institutional memory and technical knowledge and recognizing \nolder workers\u2019 other commitments, such as caring responsibilities (Van Yoder, 2002). \nMoreover, benefits and allowances and training and development costs to the business can be \nreduced by utilizing semi-retired, self-employed people or leased employees (Phillips, 2004). \nDespite concerns that older employees are less flexible and willing to adapt to new workplace \npractices and procedures, other research into older workforces has shown that their \nproductivity does compare favourably to that of other age groups. In many cases they are \nregarded as having a higher output because of their levels of seniority and experience, and \ntheir greater organizational commitment and stability. Older workers have been found to have \na much lower rate of turnover as they are content to finish their employment days with the one \nemployer (Ntatsopoulos, 2001) This makes them a very attractive proposition for SMEs that \ncan ill afford high levels of attrition and turnover and wish to minimize costs of re-hiring and \ninduction training. \n \nAs the workforce increasingly matures, retaining employees with critical skills, creating \ncareer paths to help senior employees break out of career plateau, and retaining senior \n 14\nemployees whose skills have become outdated and require further development, will pose \nspecial challenges for organisations.  Yet, few organisations, large or small, have policies in \nplace to capitalize on the advantages of not only hiring but also retaining (and retraining) \nolder workers. Traditionally, training within organisations has been directed at the youngest \nemployees and focused heavily on the induction period and the early career of employees. \nVan Yoder (2002) notes that this reflected the assumption that training costs would be \namortized over time among employees in their 20s, 30s and 40s who would not only stay with \nthe company but who would use newly acquired skills. Yet, organisations now find that \nyounger employees are more likely to move organisations frequently and that they may \nactually receive greater returns on their investment in offering training to older employees \nwho tend to stay with the one organisation until retirement. Indeed, Van Yoder (2002) claims \nthat if companies track tenure for employees at different ages and increase the frequency that \nretraining is offered, they may find that older workers provide some relief to the challenge of \nwisely investing training dollars. Other research has suggested that training and development \nfor older workers must focus on active participation and attention being devoted to structure, \nfamiliarity, organisation and time (Manheimer, 1998).  Importantly, offering such training \nwithin SMEs should also fit within that which Jennings et. al., (1996) refer to as a job-centred \nfocus which also reflects a holistic and integrated approach to work and management and the \nincorporation of learning into normal working activities. This supports Harvey and Sherer\u2019s \n(2002) contention that organisations that have policies in place to retain or hire older workers \nand to capitalize on their benefits, shared common characteristics, such as: top management \nsupport; identification of their own organizational barriers; willingness to eliminate these \nbarriers; flexibility and appreciation of the contribution of older workers.  \n \nGeneration X and Generation Y \n 15\nIn addition to the problem faced by HR managers in needing to manage out non-performing \nolder employees whilst retaining and retraining the productive ones, is the difficulty in \nattaining and retaining productive younger employees. One of the problems in doing so arises \nfrom the mobility of today\u2019s workforce, which is most particularly evident amongst younger \nworkers as employers in the ageing, slow-growing industrialized nations are eager for talent \nwhile the developing world is educating more workers than it can productively employ \n(Johnston, 1996). Organisations will need to offer attractive conditions if they are to attract \nand retain these younger employees that show a propensity to be highly mobile and seek self-\nemployment. O\u2019Bannon (2001) states that Generation X-ers are self-reliant yet jaded \nsurvivors who live in times of relatively high unemployment compared to their parents. They \nare also haunted by their parents being retrenched and having watched their parents devote \ntheir lives to a corporation only to be \u201cbecome the human flotsam of downsizing\u201d (Ruch, \n2000), Gen X-ers do not want to make the same mistake. As such, they highly value \nentrepreneurship and working for themselves and are quick to capitalize on job opportunities \nelsewhere (O\u2019Bannon, 2001).   \n \nIn the United States in the 1990s, large business laid off 10 million employees but in the same \ntimeframe small business and entrepreneurs created 20 million jobs. Indeed, Ryan (2004) has \nfound that nearly 60% of small business in the United States are started by women, minorities \nand Generation X-ers. As entrepreneurs like to be around other entrepreneurs, the smaller \nbusiness that wants to attract and retain such people that will contribute to organizational \ngrowth will need to provide a dynamic and challenging workplace.  What Gen X-ers value \nmost is the ability to keep learning and advancing their skill set is a top priority (Tulgan, \n1995). Furthermore, they want formal learning, incidental learning and action learning. While \nthe smaller employer may believe that they face the risk of training other people\u2019s workers, \n 16\nGen X-ers have been found to stay with the same employer when training and development is \nmade available (Tulgan, 1995). For the smaller firm that is concerned about succession \nplanning, loss of talent and wasted training dollars, there needs to be attention given to the \nneed to provide interesting and meaningful work and projects to retain the younger employee \n\u2013 and to become a destination of choice in which people want to work (Matzek, 2005).  \nAchieving this necessitates a top-down recognition within the organization that training, \ndevelopment and learning must be as much a part of the organizational culture as \nmanufacturing and selling and requires a long-term commitment from both management and \nemployees (Jennings et. al., 1996). \nO\u2019Reilly and Vella-Zarb (2000) state that it is clear from talking to Generation Y that they \nalready know they do not want to live or work the way those who came before them did and \ntheir outlook is fundamentally different from any other group of young people in the last 50 \nyears.  The so-called \u201cme-generation\u201d can prove very difficult to manage because of their \nshort attention spans.  Sometimes called Nexters, the Net Generation or Millenials, Hatfield \n(2002) states that while Gen Y-ers are better educated, far more techno-savvy and more \ncreative than those who have come before them, they know what they want and have no \nproblem telling people what they want. What this means for organisations is that if they want \nto retain the Gen Y-ers they will need to meet their demands to be entertained and to do work \nin short blocks of time. \n \nRuch (2000) argues that the movement of Gen Y-ers into the workforce has altered the \ntraditional scenario of a worker having to hit the deck running, to one in which the employer \nis the one having to catch up, and embrace the diversity of attitudes that they are hiring \u2013 a \npotential innovative learning opportunity presented to SMEs. Gen Y-ers have been treated \nmore as individuals than any other generation. For them, focus has been placed on learning \n 17\ndifferences and though overall unemployment is higher, part-time and entry level jobs are \nfairly plentiful and work is more challenging and flexible (Hill, 2002). They place emphasis \non personal experience rather than performance \u2013 stating that they should be rewarded on the \nbasis of their own capabilities rather than against a prescribed system of objectives (Hill, \n2002). While this may be at odds with current large organisation thinking, it does provide an \nopportunity for SMEs to develop and challenge Generation Y.  \n \nCaudron (1997) suggests that Generation X has paved the way in forcing organisations to \nrethink and re-engineer their training programs drastically  in that no longer can organisations \nsimply just tell the younger employees what their training agenda is - they have to explain \nwhy people need to learn X or Y. The SMEs that will be successful in developing both Gen \nX-ers and Gen Y-ers will be those that ensure that development is conducive to their needs. In \nthe past two decades, trainers have learned to design sessions that allow plenty of time for \nquestions and answers, provide opportunity for resolving of problems in breakout sessions, \ninclude games and fun activities and display expertise early on to get Gen X-ers\u2019 respect \n(O\u2019Bannon, 2001). However, there is more that needs to be done to attract and retain Gen X-\ners. Recognising that training and orienting works as a motivator, managers of smaller \nbusinesses need to consider the career plans of Gen X-ers and target training to those areas to \ngive them skills that makes Gen X-ers feel challenged and more marketable (Losyk, 1997). It \nis important to work with their skills and commitments and for Gen X-ers this means making \nthe best use of their entrepreneurial talent and multi-industry and\/or multi-occupational \nexperience. For Gen Y-ers SMEs will need to provide individual attention, stimulating \ntraining practices that entertain them and on-going challenges. Brown (1995) says that for \nGen Y-ers, learning should be experiential and they will be motivated to learn by being \nengaged in creating their own learning environments and being provided with challenges. It is \n 18\nimportant that SMEs learn to work with the particular attributes that Gen X-ers and Y-ers \npossess and this means making the best use of their technological know-how and creativity. \n \nBlending different generations in the workplace - some suggestions for SMEs \nGiven the highly diverse work styles, attitudes and behaviour of older workers, Boomers, and \nGeneration X and Y, organisations today face the possibility for greater generational clashes \nand the need to consider how to best work with this age diversity. Once managers of SMEs \nunderstand the differing generations in their workplaces they can begin to learn how to \nmanage, motivate, train, develop and educate them. Crucial to an organisations\u2019 success in \ndeveloping all generations will be providing opportunities to bring the groups together. This \nnecessitates building teams that make the best use of the skills of all generations, including \nthe rational values, honed communication skills and experience of older employees combined \nwith the creativity and technical skills of younger employees (Hatfield, 2002). Ruch (2000) \nsuggests that new recruits should be given an opportunity to learn about the rest of the \ncompany and employees with opportunities to make presentations about their jobs (and \ndepartments, if relevant) so that all can learn about what others do. He further suggests that an \ninternship program could be developed for younger employees where they can test drive other \npositions, and veteran employees could be provided with the opportunity to share their \nlearning and experience with younger employees in a regular class (Ruch, 2000). Moreover, \nmentoring can play an important role in training, development and learning in harnessing the \nlife experience of older workers, the entrepreneurial talent of the Gen X-ers, and the technical \naptitude of Gen Y-ers to leverage new ideas. While younger employees can be mentored by \nolder, more experienced employees, the younger employee can in turn mentor older \nemployees about the internet and other new technologies (Wainwright, 2004). Indeed, in \ndeveloping mentoring programs to facilitate older and younger employees to work effectively \n 19\ntogether SMEs can ensure not only improvements to overall success and productivity of their \norganisations but also decreased costs of turnover and enhanced worker morale.  \n \nBiographical Notes \n \nProfessor Graham Beaver is responsible for much of the academic research on business \ngrowth and strategic management at Nottingham Business School, particularly as it affects \nsmall and emerging enterprises in the economy.
