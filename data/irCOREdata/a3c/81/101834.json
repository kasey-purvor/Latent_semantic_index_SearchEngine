INTRODUCTION\nMASS production of high quality high temperature super-conductor Josephson junctions and junction arrays at\nlow cost is still a technical challenge. Following the successful\nfabrication of high quality Josephson junctions with the focused\nelectron beam irradiation (FEBI) damage approach [1]\u2013[4],\nmasked ion irradiation damage (MID) has been explored for\nits potential as a flexible and high yield production method\n[5]\u2013[9]. Early experimental results were very promising, but the\nperformance of those junctions fabricated by the MID process\nwas not as good as the devices formed by the FEBI technique.\nFirstly, the unsatisfactory performance is related to the diffi-\nculty in confining the damage profile due to mask side-wall\nscattering [10]. Such an unwanted damage profile broadening\neffect could be reduced by optimising the ion beam irradiation\ncondition [11]\u2013[13]. Secondly, mass disparity between negative\nelectron and positive ion implies significant differences in\nirradiation defect production on different sublattice sites of\nYBa Cu O (YBCO) by electron and ion irradiations.\nHeavy ions tend to create less defects on the oxygen sublattice,\nwhile the majority of defects created by electron beams is on\nManuscript received August 6, 2002.

In order to achieve an oxygen sublattice site\ndominated defect production process, we explored the proton\nbeam irradiation damage process combined with metal mask\nstructures. Using the 30 keV Ga focussed ion beam (FIB)\ntechnique, we have fabricated a metal mask structure which\ncontains a 50 nm opening width with about 400 nm depth The\naspect ratio of the mask opening is up to 8.\nOur early experimental work on the masked 50 keV proton\nbeam irradiation damage employed a Nb mask with about 30\nnm Au in between YBCO and Nb mask. Promising results had\nbeen observed [9], but the YBCO thin film after the FIB process\nwas very sensitive to the proton beam irradiation. Similar re-\nsults had been obtained with a pure Au masked fabrication\nprocess [14]. By exposing an YBCO thin film to the Ga beam\ndeliberately and followed by proton beam irradiation damage\nfor both Ga exposed and Ga free samples at the same time,\nthe detrimental effect of Ga contamination and proton beam as-\nsisted diffusion of Ga in YBCO on superconductivity has been\nwell established. A critical step for a better device performance\nis to stop the penetration of Ga into YBCO thin films. We have\ntried deliberately leaving substantial Au mask un-cut during\nFIB process. This did lead to a much improved Josephson junc-\ntion performance [15], [16]. Though thick Au buffer layers can\nbe used to stop Ga contamination into YBCO, its side effects\nare also clear. Firstly, the thick Au stopping layer destroys the\nhigh definition of the barrier area formed under irradiation by\nhigh resolution mask [12]. Secondly, Au mask left on top of\nthe irradiation damaged YBCO barrier may act as a by-pass\nfor the electrical current if the normal state resistance of the\nbarrier is higher than the Au\/YBCO interface resistance. Fur-\nthermore, as we control the cutting depth by monitoring the\nresistance increase of the metallic Au mask [17], a more con-\nvenient and accurate approach should involve a thin layer of\nnonconducting buffer layer which serves both for the Ga stop-\nping and restricting current leakage from the designed SNS\npath, where the N barrier is formed by the masked proton beam\nirradiation.\nRecently we have explored masked proton beam irradiation\ndamage for YBCO Josephson junction fabrication by intro-\nducing a thin layer of amorphous nonconducting perovskite\noxide as the Ga stopping buffer. In addition to a better control\nin mask structure cutting, this extra oxide layer also helped\ngreatly for the removal of the Au mask after the ion irradiation.\nExcellent Josephson junctions and Josephson junction arrays\nwith 10 junctions were fabricated employing these improve-\nment steps.\n1051-8223\/03$17.00 \u00a9 2003 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

IRRADIATION DAMAGE PROFILE SIMULATION\nIrradiation damage profiles created by proton beam irradia-\ntion have been studied by Monte Carlo simulation using a mod-\nified CRYSTAL code [18]. The simulation details have been de-\nscribed elsewhere [10]\u2013[13]. The model mask structure is com-\nposed of an amorphous LaAlO substrate, 100 nm single crys-\ntalline YBCO, various LaAlO buffer layers and Au mask. Here\nwe will focus on the effect of a LaAlO buffer layer in between\nthe YBCO and the metal mask on the damage profile formation\ninside YBCO.\nFig. 1 shows the simulated 2D irradiation damage profiles in\nAu masked structures with 50 nm and 200 nm LaAlO buffer\nlayer respectively. The irradiation damage profile inside the\nYBCO is wider compared to the 50 nm opening of Au mask\nstructure. Such a broadening effect is intrinsic to the nanometer\nscale opening of high aspect ratio metal mask. However, the\nLaAlO buffer layer also plays an important role in enhancing\nsuch a broadening effect significantly. The increase in overall\ndamage level in a model structure with 200 nm LaAlO buffer\nlayer compared to the case with only 50 nm LaAlO buffer is\nthe direct consequence of ion energy reduction to the YBCO\nthin film as more energy had been deposited in the thick\nLaAlO buffer. Though a similar damage level in the central\nbarrier area could be achieved by tuning the irradiation dose,\nFig. 2. Lateral distribution of irradiation damage level along the middle of\nYBCO thin film with 50 nm and 200 nm LaAlO buffer layers respectively.\nthe big difference in the formation of boundary area outside the\ncentral 50 nm zone might be responsible for the different per-\nformance for the Josephson junctions formed in this way. This\ncan be viewed clearly in Fig. 2 by plotting out the irradiation\ndamage level along the middle of the YBCO thin film target.\nFor the model mask with 50 nm LaAlO buffer layer, a sharp\nreduction in damage level by nearly a factor of 10 suggests\na sharp reduction in superconducting transition temperature\nacross the barrier boundary. In contrast to this, a much slower\nand broader reduction in damage level has been obtained in the\nmodel structure with 200 nm LaAlO buffer layer. By changing\nthe LaAlO buffer layer thickness while keeping the total\nLaAlO and Au thickness at 450 nm, a significant broadening\neffect has been obtained in mask structures with LaAlO buffer\nlayer thickness greater than 100 nm. The thinner the LaAlO ,\nthe sharper the barrier boundary and the narrower barrier\narea formed by the irradiation process. For a simple practical\nhandling, we recommend a thickness of nonconducting oxide\nlayer in between 50 to 100 nm as a standard for the practical\ndevice fabrications. The simulation results described above\nwere obtained with LaAlO buffer layer, but the results should\nbe similar for SrTiO which has a similar stopping power.\nIn Fig. 3(a), the 2D plot of irradiation damage profile inside\nthe YBCO thin film clearly shows the formation of a series\nof damage barriers by using a Au mask with multiple 50 nm\nopenings, where the separation between each 50 nm opening\nis 100 nm. The damage level in the middle of the YBCO thin\nfilm is plotted out in Fig. 3(b). With 50 keV proton and 50 nm\nLaAlO buffer layer, the minimum space in between two neigh-\nboring openings is about 50 nm. A slightly higher integration\ndensity could be achieved with heavy ions, as we discussed be-\nfore [12].\nIII. RADIAL DISTRIBUTION OF DEFECTS AND RECOMBINATION\nIt is very clear that the performance of the Josephson junction\nformed by ion beam irradiation is dependent on the stability of\nthe defects created by the damage process. Using TRIM-CAS-\nCADE Monte Carlo simulation code [19], we have constructed\nthe integrated radial distribution of defect concentrations on\neach sublattice site upon irradiation in amorphous YBCO thin\nfilm target.

MASKED PROTON BEAM IRRADIATION EXPERIMENTS\nWith our dedicated cold implant sample holder with in-situ\nelectrical characterization facility [16], we have fabricated\nYBCO Josephson junctions and junction arrays using the\n50 keV proton beam irradiation damage technique at about\n50 K. This was carried out on a versatile Danfysik 200 kV\naccelerator with proton current of about 250 A. The proton\nbeam was scanned over a 200 mm by 200 mm square area with\nthe sample holder in the central and four Faraday cups around\nthe four corners. The sample was tilted by 15 in order to\navoid channeling effects. The formation of Josephson coupling\nis monitored in-situ, but more detailed characterization is\ncarried out later on after room temperature annealing. With\nmetal masks designed based on the Monte Carlo simulation,\nan irradiation dose up to 4 10 protons\/cm is enough to\nform the Josephson junction. After low temperature irradiation\nand in-situ electrical property characterization, the device was\nwarmed up slowly at a rate of 3 K\/min to room temperature.\nThen the Au mask was removed for further characterization.\nIn Fig. 5(a) we present the magnetic field modulation of a typ-\nical Josephson junction fabricated by proton beam irradiation at\n50 K with 50 nm SrTiO buffer layer to stop Ga contamination.\nA familiar dependence of critical current upon magnetic field\nhas been observed in the junction made with focused electron\nbeam irradiation damage [3], [4], while such a modulation pat-\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Experimental\nobservation of microwave response for a 10 junction array is\nshown in Fig. 5(b) with the separation between the neighboring\njunctions about 500 nm. Lock-in measurement results reveal\nthat all 10 junctions are phase locked. The lock-in resistance\nversus bias current measurements show clearly 10 peaks and the\nvalue of the lock-in resistance is exactly 10 times of the resis-\ntance for a single junction. From Fig. 5(b), the voltage step cor-\nresponds to the value of 10 junctions connected in series as well.\nThe detailed experimental results will be published elsewhere.\nThis observation is consistent with our Monte Carlo simulation\nresults, as the 50 keV proton beam irradiation should make good\nJosephson arrays with the separation between the neighboring\njunctions well above 50 nm.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nFrom Monte Carlo simulation and experimental masked\nion beam irradiation damage observation, it has been well\nestablished that the key factor affecting the performance of\nYBCO Josephson junctions is still the control of barrier layer\nformation. Narrow barriers have been fabricated successfully\nby masked proton beam irradiation with metal masks being\nmade by focussed Ga beam milling. Care to avoid Ga contam-\nination is important to keep the high quality of YBCO thin\nfilm, while an optimized irradiation condition creates high\ndefinition of damage barriers. This has been proved by our\nsuccess in fabricating YBCO single Josephson junctions and\nprototype Josephson junction arrays. The fabrication process\nis reproducible and can produce devices with uniform physical\nproperties.\nREFERENCES\n[1] S. Tolpygo, B. Nadgorny, S. Sokhor, F. Tafuri, Y. Lin, A. Bourdillon,\nand M.
