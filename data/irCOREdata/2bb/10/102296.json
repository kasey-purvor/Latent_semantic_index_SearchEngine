Kira et a1 [l] studied a microscopic model of a plasma of unbound electron- \nhole pairs, which included Coulomb correlations but not the possibility of formation of incoherent excitons. They \nfound that within this model a sharp photoluminescence(P1) peak at the exciton frequency developed as the carriers \nrelaxed to the bottom of their respective bands. \nHere we present results from two direct experiments to resolve this issue and find that indeed excitonic PL spectra \ncan, as predicted by Kira[ 11, be produced without the presence of excitons. First we detect the presence of excitonic \nbound states by measuring the THz absorption of photo-excited excitons using a far infra-red free electron laser tuned \nto the 1s-2p transition energy (150 pm, 8.3 meV, or 2.0 THz). Second, we perform time resolved photoluminescence \nunder essentially the same excitation conditions to measure the onset of PL at the exciton energy. The sample is \na GaAdAlGaAs multiple quantum well with 120 wells of 6.5 nm width with clear heavy and light hole exciton \nabsorption peaks at 1.594 eV and 1.615 eV respectively (Fig. 1). All experiments were performed in a continuous \nflow liquid helium cryostat. \nWe measure the transmission of the N 15 ps FIR pulse as a function of the pump-probe delay. When pumping with \na lOOfs pulse at 1.56 eV, well below the intehand exciton peak, no change in transmission is seen (Fig. 2, c w e  (a)) \nconfirming that coherent interactions produce no measuxable signal. Pumping resonantly into the exciton, curve (b), \na strong induced absorption is seen immediately after the pump pulse. This reflects the creation of geminate excitons \nand their subsequent excitation by the FIR pulse from the 1s to the 2p state. T h s  induced absorption is shows no decay \nover the 500 ps window afforded by the FEL setup. Pumping well above the gap at 1.658 eV, curve (c), the absorption \nchange becomes substantially less but there is no delay in the onset of absorption. That there is no increase in 1s-2p \nabsorption during the 500 ps time window implies that the exciton formation time must be longer than 2 ns. \nTime resolved photoluminescence measurements at the exciton frequency were also performed (Fig 3). The above \nband-gap excitation at 1.66 eV closely matches the pump-probe excitation of Fig. 2, curve (c) both in wavelength and \nin photoexcited camer density. A biexponetial fit gives times of 570 ps (rise) and 1640 ps (decay). As this rise time \nis well below the lower limit of exciton formation time as deduced from our transmission measurements, the observed \nPL cannot be due to the formation of a population of incoherent excitons. \nThus we have experimentally verified the remarkable prediction of Kira et a1 that PL at the exciton energy may be \nobsemed without the existence of a excitonic plasma. \nQThPDA8 \nFig. 1 Linear absorption spectrum of the sample \n(solid curve).
