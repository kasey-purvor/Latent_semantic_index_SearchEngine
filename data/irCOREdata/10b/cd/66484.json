We\nshow that the energy radiated expressed in terms of the loss\nof vortex line length is a simple function of the reconnection\nangle. In addition, we study the temporal and spatial distri-\nbution of the radiation and show that energy is emitted in the\nform of a rarefaction pulse. The pulse evolves into a sound\nwave with a wavelength of 6\u2212 8 healing lengths.\n03.75.Fi, 67.40.Vs, 67.57.De\nThe decay of superfluid turbulence in the limit of low\ntemperature raises some fundamental questions in the\nfield of quantum fluids. For example, vortex tangles pro-\nduced in superfluid helium at T < 100 mK are observed\nto decay [1], but at these temperatures the frictional dis-\nsipation due to thermal excitations is practically negli-\ngible. Recent theoretical work [2\u20134] has highlighted the\npossible role of sound emission as a dissipation mecha-\nnism. Sound emission may occur due to vortex motion\nor reconnection, however, conventional numerical simula-\ntions based on vortex filaments governed by incompress-\nible Euler dynamics (the Biot-Savart law) are unable to\ndescribe this process. A useful tool to study vortex-\nsound interactions is the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation.\nAlthough unable to fully represent the physics of HeII,\nthe GP equation does provide a sophisticated fluid dy-\nnamical model capable of describing vortex nucleation\n[5] and reconnections [6\u20138]. Furthermore, the GP equa-\ntion has been shown to provide an accurate description of\nthe recently discovered atomic Bose-Einstein condensates\n[9], where similar issues of vortex-sound interactions are\nlikely to occur, particularly in experiments where many\nvortices are formed [10,11].\nIn this letter, we compute the sound energy radiated\ndue to superfluid vortex reconnections using the GP\nmodel. We parameterise the energy in terms of vortex\nline length, and show that the vortex line length de-\nstroyed during a reconnection is a simple function of the\nreconnection angle. In addition, we measure the tem-\nporal and spatial distribution of the radiation and show\nthat energy is emitted in the form of a rarefaction pulse\nwhich subsequently disperses into sound waves.\nTo produce a reconnection we collide two vortex rings\nwhose axes of propagation are offset. This system has the\nadvantage that by varying the offset we can study a range\nof reconnection angles. In addition, a well behaved ini-\ntial state can be constructed within a spatially confined\nregion. We adopt the same numerical methods as in our\nprevious work [12\u201314]. The key points are that through-\nout the paper we use dimensionless units, where distance\nand velocity are measured in terms of the healing length,\n\u03be, and the sound speed, c, respectively. In addition, the\nasymptotic number density, n0, is rescaled to unity. The\ninitial state is taken as the product of two vortex ring\nstates, \u03c8(r, 0) = \u03c61(r \u2212 r1)\u03c6\n\u2217\n2\n(r \u2212 r2), where \u03c61,2(r)\nare time-independent vortex ring solutions of the uniform\nflow equation found by Newton\u2019s method [13]. We ar-\nrange for the rings to propagate in the \u00b1x directions with\nan offset in the y direction, i.e., r1,2 = (\u00b125v,\u00b1D\/2, 0),\nwhere x, y, and z correspond to the axes shown in Fig. 1,\nv is the ring velocity, and D is the offset between the\npropagation axes of the two rings. The initial state is\nevolved according to the dimensionless GP equation,\ni\u2202t\u03c8 = \u2212 12\u22072\u03c8 + (|\u03c8|2 \u2212 1)\u03c8 , (1)\nusing a semi-implicit Crank-Nicholson time step. To\nmodel a large box, we map an infinite length onto the\nspace \u22121 \u2264 x\u2032 \u2264 1 using x\u2032 = x\/(|x| + \u03b6) with \u03b6 = 12.\nWe use a grid spacing, \u2206x\u2032 = 0.007, and a time-step,\n\u2206t = 0.01. Simulations have been performed with vortex\nring radii of R = 5.04, 6.00 and 7.30, which correspond\nto velocties v = 0.34, 0.3, and 0.26, respectively.\nA typical sequence illustrating the vortex ring colli-\nsion is shown in Fig. 1. As the rings approach they\nstretch in the yz plane. The reconnections occur along\nthe z axis at around t = 30. The reconnections produce\ntwo highly elongated rings and two sound pulses which\npropagate outwards along the \u00b1z axis. The sound pulse\nappears in Fig. 1 as an oval in the centre of the top view\nat t = 40. The stretched rings (t = 50) rapidly shrink\ninto two smaller vibrating rings which move outwards.\nFor the offset D = 4 shown in Fig. 1, the outgoing rings\npropagate at an angle \u03c6 = \u00b156\u25e6 to the x axis. The\nsmaller radius of the outgoing rings reflects the energy\nloss due to the reconnections. For larger offsets, the col-\nlision is less violent than the example shown, and the\nscattering angle of the outgoing rings, \u03c6, is smaller.\nTo quantify the sound energy we calculate the energy\nwithin a measurement sphere of radius 20. The energy\nis defined relative to a uniform laminar state as in our\nprevious work [13]. The energy per ring as a function\nof time for collisions between rings with radii R = 6.0,\noffset by D = 2 to D = 8.5, is shown in Fig. 2(inset). If\n1\nthe reconnection occurs a few healing lengths along the\nz axis at t \u223c 30, and the sound pulse travels outwards at\nspeed c = 1, then one would expect to observe the sound\nleaving the measurement volume between t = 45 and\nt = 50. This appears as an energy drop in the numerical\ndata, Fig. 2(inset). After the sound pulse has left the\nsphere one expects the energy to remain approximately\nconstant until the outgoing vortex rings leave between\nt = 60 and t = 75. This energy \u2018plateau\u2019 is well defined\nin Fig. 2(inset) for offsets between D = 4 and D = 8.5,\nbut for smaller offsets the outgoing rings are too fast to\nbe resolved from the sound pulse. We define the radiated\nsound energy as the difference between the initial energy\nand the value at the centre of the plateau.\nx\nz\ny\nx\ny\n(a)\n(b)\nt = 20\nt = 20\nt = 30 t = 40\nt = 30 t = 40 t = 50\nt = 60 t = 70\nt = 60\nFIG. 1. Sequence of density isosurfaces (|\u03c8|2 = 0.75) illus-\ntrating a vortex ring collision with ring radius R = 6 and\noffset D = 4. A side view (a) and a top view (b) are shown.\nInitially, the rings propagate along the x axis and collide in the\nyz plane at t \u223c 30. The collision produces highly stretched\nrings (t = 50) which snap back into two smaller rings moving\nat \u00b156\u25e6 to the x axis. The sound pulse is emitted along the\n\u00b1z axis, and appears as an oval in the centre of the top view\nat t = 40.\nA convenient way to express the energy loss is in terms\nof an effective vortex line length destroyed. To calculate\nthe change in vortex line length we convert between en-\nergy and length using the analytical result for the energy\nof a vortex ring with radius R [15],\nE = 2pi2R\n[\nln\n(\n8R\na\n)\n\u2212 1.615\n]\n, (2)\nwith a = 1\/\n\u221a\n2. Clearly, this is approximate as the out-\ngoing vortex rings are excited. The vortex line length\ndestroyed, lloss, as a function of reconnection angle,\n\u03b8 = 2 cos\u22121(D\/2R), is plotted in Fig. 2. For intermediate\nangles, the data appear to lie on a unique curve, inde-\npendent of the initial ring radius. A good fit is given by,\nlloss = tan\n2(\u03b8\/2) = (4R2 \u2212 D2)\/D2. For large \u03b8 (small\noffset D) most of the energy is emitted as sound and\nthe energy plateau is not well defined leading to a large\nerror. Additional errors occur when comparing Eq. (2)\nwith our numerical energy data due to the finite size of\nour measurement volume. This error is largest when the\nincoming and outgoing rings are largest, i.e. for large R\nand large D. This leads to the over estimate of vortex\nline loss apparent for the R = 7.30, \u03b8 \u2264 pi\/2 data in\nFig. 2.\n0    \n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\nVo\nrte\nx \nlin\ne \nle\nng\nth\n d\nes\ntro\nye\nd\nReconnection Angle \u03b8\npi\/2 pi\n0 25 50 75 100\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\nEn\ner\ngy\n in\n m\nea\nsu\nre\nm\nen\nt v\nol\num\ne\nTime\nFIG. 2. Vortex line length destroyed as a function of the\nreconnection angle. The data correspond to ring radii of\nR = 5.04 (\u25e6), 6.00 (2), and 7.30 (\u00d7). The vortex line\nlength destroyed is calculated from the energy decrease within\na measurement sphere when the sound pulse exits. The\ntime-dependence of the energy per ring within the measure-\nment sphere for ring radii R = 6.0 and offsets D = 2 \u2212 8.5\nin increments of 0.5 is shown inset. The sound energy exits\nbetween t = 48 and t = 52. The energy plateau at t \u223c 60\nindicates the energy loss due to sound emission.\nThe dependence of the vortex line loss on reconnec-\ntion angle can in principle be applied to determine the\nsound energy emitted in other reconnection geometries.\nHowever, in the case of straight line vortices, it is known\nthat the lines tend to become more anti-parallel as they\napproach [17,18]. This will tend to increase the energy\nradiated. To convert the dimensionless units into val-\nues applicable to HeII, we take the number density as\nn0 = 2.18 \u00d7 1028 m\u22123, the quantum of circulation as\n\u03ba = h\/m = 9.98 \u00d7 10\u22128 m2s\u22121, and the healing length\nas \u03be\/\n\u221a\n2 = 0.128 nm [19], then the unit of energy is\nh\u00afn0c\u03be\n2 = 6.56 \u00d7 10\u221224 J or 0.475 K. For these parame-\nters, the energy radiated for reconnection angles of pi\/2\nand 3pi\/4 are 9.2 \u00d7 10\u221223 J (6.65 K) and 5.2 \u00d7 10\u221222 J\n(37.5 K), respectively.\nTo determine the character of the sound radiation we\nhave studied the temporal and spatial distribution of the\nemission. The density along the z-axis for a collision\nwith ring radius R = 6 and offset D = 8 is shown in\nFig. 3. Initially the density is uniform except for a slight\nincrease near the origin indicating the approaching rings.\nBetween t = 25 and t = 30 the rings collide in the xy\n2\nplane. During the collision, the vortex cores merge while\nthe rings grow outwards. Due to this stretching effect,\nthe reconnection point is pushed outwards along the z\naxis to z \u223c \u00b17 and delayed until t \u223c 29 (if there were\nno distortion of the incoming rings, one would expect the\nreconnection to occur at z = \u00b14.5 and t = 25). When\nthe circulation is cancelled at t = 29, the density is zero\nat z = \u00b17. This density minimum continues to move\noutwards in the same direction as the vortex cores prior\nto the reconnection. As the pulse moves outwards the\ndensity mimimum gradually fills in.\n0 10 20 30\n \n1.0\n \n1.5 \n \n2.0 \n \n2.5 \n \n3.0 \n \n3.5 \nD\nen\nsi\nty\nz\nFIG. 3. The density along the z axis for a collision between\ntwo vortex rings with radius R = 6 and offset D = 8. The\neleven curves, corresponding to times t = 0 to t = 50 in incre-\nments of 5, are offset in increments of 0.25 along the y axis.\nInitially the density is uniform except for a slight increase near\nthe origin indicating the approaching rings. Between t = 25\nand t = 30 the rings collide in the xy plane. This results in\nthe formation of a rarefaction pulse which moves outwards.\nNote that initially the density at the center of the rarefaction\npulse is zero and then increases. For t > 40 the pulse evolves\ninto a sound wave with a wavelength of 6\u2212 8 healing lengths.\nAs shown for the case of vortex nucleation by a mov-\ning sphere [14], further insight can be gained by consid-\nering the time evolution as a transition between time-\nindependent states. For the head-on collision (D = 0),\none can regard the segments of the ring as anti-parallel\nvortex lines. The two dimensional time-independent so-\nlutions for two opposite sign vortices have been studied\nby Jones and Roberts [16]. They show that when the vor-\ntex cores merge they form a rarefaction pulse. In a three\ndimensional situation, as the rarefaction pulse expands\noutwards the energy per unit length decreases which cor-\nresponds to a lower energy on the dispersion curve. The\nlower energy rarefaction pulse has a higher central den-\nsity and moves faster eventually approaching the sound\nspeed [16]. This exactly describes the behaviour apparent\nin Fig. 3. Eventually the rarefaction pulse evolves into a\nsound wave with a central wavelength of approximately\n7 healing lengths. For HeII, taking \u03be\/\n\u221a\n2 = 0.128 nm\n[19] this converts to 1.3 nm, which corresponds to an\nintermediate phonon wavelength (cf. maxon and roton\nwavelengths of 0.6 nm and 0.3 nm, respectively)\nThe spatial extent of the sound pulse in the x = 0\nplane for the same parameters as in Fig. 3 but at a later\ntime, t = 54, is shown in Fig. 4. The density variation\naround the origin is a remnant of the departing vortex\nrings. The sound pulse appears as two crescent shaped\ndensity waves with an angular distribution roughly equal\nto the reconnection angle (indicated by the white lines in\nFig. 4). A similar distribution is observed in the y = 0\nplane. By t = 54, the sound energy is spread over a large\narea and the amplitude of the density variation is very\nsmall (only a few percent). The spherical wave fronts\nare consistent with the reconnection position and time\nindicated by Fig. 3.\n\u221240 \u221220 0 20 40\n\u221240\n\u221230\n\u221220\n\u221210\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\ny\nFIG. 4. Density cross-sections in the x = 0 plane at t = 54\nfor ring radii R = 6 with offset D = 8 (same parameters as in\nFig. 3). The sound pulse appears as two arcs with radius of\ncurvature, 25, suggesting that the reconnections occurred at\nz = \u00b17 and t = 29 consistent with Fig. 3. The angular spread\nis approximately equal to the reconnection angle (\u03b8 = 96\u25e6 for\nthis example). The white lines indicate the positions of the\nreconnections, z = \u00b17, the reconnection angle, \u03b8, and the\nexpected position of the sound pulse. Grey scale: black 0.95;\nwhite 1.025.\nIn summary, we have made direct quantitative mea-\nsurements of the sound energy emitted due to superfluid\nvortex reconnections. We show that the energy radiated\ncan be parameterised in terms of the loss of vortex line\nlength which is a simple function of the reconnection an-\ngle. The energy radiated increases dramatically as the\nlines become more anti-parallel which suggests that re-\n3\nconnections may be a significant decay mechanism for su-\nperfluid turbulence in the limit of low temperature. We\nalso show that the radiation initially appears in the form\nof a rarefaction pulse which evolves into a sound wave\nwith a wavelength of 6\u2212 8 healing lengths.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank would to thank the Newton Institute, Cam-\nbridge University, where part of this work was completed.\nFinancial support was provided by the EPSRC.\n[1] P.
