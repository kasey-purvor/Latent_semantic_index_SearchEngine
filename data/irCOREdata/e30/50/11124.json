Information and communication \ntechnologies (ICTs) are seen as one of the key catalysts of these changes. However, \nwhile many states may have reconfigured their legal institutions and modified their \nregulatory apparatus, these shifts do not represent a significant change in the role of \nthe capitalist state. The frequent reification of the (global) market often underpins the \nargument that there has been a significant decline in the efficacy of the state, or the \nclaim that we have entered some new phase of global economic organisation. \nHowever, markets need extensive political and legal foundations: where these \nfoundations are absent \u2018normal\u2019 capitalism does not thrive; rather it is replaced by \nklepto-capitalism and economic collapse (as in Russia in the early 1990s).\n2\n Often in \nthe accounts of the new \u2018information age\u2019, the market is depicted as a natural \nphenomena, separate from the political economic functions of the state. This \nreification can obscure the underlying supports on which information age capitalism \ncontinues to rest, most importantly the continuing centrality of commodification for \ncapitalism\u2019s global reproduction.\n3\n \nAlthough, not the central subject of this article, it is as well to briefly suggest the \noutline of markets in information and knowledge. Capitalism requires the \ncommodification of goods into properties that can be bought and sold, to allow the \nexchange of goods within a developed division of labour. This needs both alienability \n(the ability to transfer legal ownership rights), and developed contract law to ensure \nsuch transfers are defensible. This underpins a \u2018credible commitment\u2019 to fulfil the \nobligations of transfer: the transfer of property rights in exchange for an agreed \npayment. This transfer requires the relinquishment of some (although not necessarily \nall) rights over the commodity by the seller in favour of the purchaser. For \ninformation and knowledge, this represents a clear difference from the \u2018free\u2019 \ncirculation, and non-rivalry of non-commodified information and\/or knowledge \ntransfer. However, without the construction of scarcity no price could be guaranteed \nfor transfer (as use could easily be obtained without purchase) and hence the market \nwould struggle to function.\n4\n \nSince 1995 intellectual property rights (IPRs) have been subject to the TRIPs \nagreement which is overseen by the World Trade Organisation (WTO). While this \nagreement does not determine national legislation, for members of the WTO to be \nTRIPs-compliant their domestic intellectual property law must support the protections \nand rights that are laid out in TRIPs\u2019 73 articles. The agreement covers not only \ngeneral provisions and basic principles, but also represents an undertaking to uphold \n                                                 \n1\n L D Eriksson \u201cThe Indeterminacy of Law or Law as a Deliberative Practice\u201d in A.

The robust dispute settlement mechanism which is a central aspect of \nthe WTO now encompasses international disputes about IPRs. Prior to 1995, while \nthere were long standing multilateral treaties in place regarding the international \nrecognition and protection of IPRs (the Paris and Berne conventions), overseen by the \nWorld Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO), these were widely regarded by \ngovernments in IPR-exporting countries as toothless in the face of \u2018piracy\u2019 and \nfacilitated the frequent disregard for the protection of IPRs in less developed \ncountries.  \nThe inclusion of the TRIPs (and the General Agreement on Trade in Services) into the \nUruguay Round final settlement was the culmination of a general strategy on behalf of \nthe US and EU to force developing countries to adopt multilateral agreements in \nsectors which they had hitherto resisted.\n5\n By withdrawing from their previous \ncommitments under GATT 1947 and therefore terminating any obligations therein, \nthe US and EU forced developing countries to accede to a much wider agreement \nunder the WTO if they wished to retain the trade arrangements with which they had \nstarted the Uruguay Round.  \nIn addition to the advantages to be gained by having a tougher multilateral \nenforcement mechanism, the US government (alongside allies in the EU) wanted to \nmove the international regulation of IPRs into the new WTO (from the WIPO) \nbecause their negotiators felt that they were more likely to gain agreements to their \nadvantage by linking these issues to the international trade regime.\n6\n The fact the \nWIPO was an agency of the United Nations, and therefore (however imperfectly) \nsubject to some pressure from development orientated interests, further encouraged \nthe move to the WTO, a separate membership organisation where free trade is the \noverriding policy concern.\n7\n It is therefore unsurprising that the TRIPs agreement \nrepresents a particular \u2018trade-related\u2019 view of the role of IPRs in economic relations. \nIndeed, a number of large multinational corporations with a particular interest in \nprotecting their IPRs played a major role in the negotiations which led to the TRIPs \nagreement, drafting the majority of the document which became the broadly \nsuccessful position advocated by the office of the US Trade Representative. These \ncompanies had a significant impact on the conceptualisation of IPRs and the \n(potentially) globalised norms of information commodification lying at the heart of \nthe TRIPs agreement. \nThe TRIPs agreement is significant in its extension of the rights of the owners of \nintellectual property, representing a major triumph for the US pharmaceutical, \nentertainments and informatics industries. The TRIPs agreement ensures that while in \nthe past there was significant variance across the global system as regards the \nprotection (and recognition) of IPRs, there is now effectively a single legislative space \nwhere ownership rights (over knowledge and information) are paramount, and thus \n                                                 \n5\n R H Steinberg, \u201cIn the Shadow of Law or Power?

Indeed, Kurt Burch contends that this expansion of ownership rights \nalso extends an essentially liberal conception of social life as relations \norganised and understood by reference to exclusive property rights... [it] \npromotes the vocabulary of rights and property and the liberal conceptual \nframework they help define.\n8\n \nFurthermore, Samuel Oddi argues that the use of a natural rights discourse tries to \nestablish that \nthese rights are so important that individual [WTO] member welfare should \nnot stand in the way of their being protected as an entitlement of the \ncreators. This invokes a counter-instrumentalist policy that members, \nregardless of their state of industrialisation, should sacrifice their national \ninterests in favour of the posited higher order of international trade.\n9\n \nThe rights of capitalists to commodify information and knowledge as they see fit are \nprivileged throughout the agreement, and are regarded as the naturally \u2018just\u2019 rights of \nownership. This attempts to raise commercial rights to exploit information and \nknowledge to the same level as human rights. Although this may be legitimate it is \nhardly uncontroversial, given that sometimes the exercise of these commercial rights \nis at the cost of the human rights of users, for instance in the realm of AIDS \nmedicines.\n10\n \nTherefore, while the agreement imposes a complex and wide ranging set of \nrequirements on signatories,\n11\n at the core is a particular set of norms regarding the \ntreatment of knowledge as property. These norms underpin the entire agreement and \nare based on the notion that the private ownership of knowledge as property is a major \nspur to continued economic development and social welfare. They further emphasise \nthe development of knowledge as an individualised and proprietorial endeavour, and \nthe legitimate reward of such individualised effort. Most obviously TRIPs includes a \nrobust norm of commodification of knowledge and information, which in itself should \nalert us to the fact that the \u2018information age\u2019 is capitalist business-as-usual, utilising \npreviously established legal structures to ensure that capitalists\u2019 ability to commodify \nimportant and profitable assets and resources continues into the so-called \u2018information \nage\u2019. It is not as some \u2018Internet Utopians\u2019 have claimed, a world beyond capitalism.\n12\n \nBefore moving to look at the issue of the \u2018information age\u2019 it as well to understand the \ninteraction of law and market. \n                                                 \n8\n K Burch, \u201cIntellectual Property Rights and the Culture of Global Liberalism\u201d 17 Science \nCommunication (1995): 215 \n9\n A S Oddi \u201cTRIPs - Natural Rights and a \u2018Polite Form of Economic Imperialism\u2019\u201d 29 Vanderbilt \nJournal of Transnational Law (1996): 440 \n10\n C May \u2018Unacceptable Costs: The Consequences of Making Knowledge Property in a Global Society\u2019 \n16 Global Society (2002): 123-144. \n11 Space precludes a detailed account of TRIPs numerous sections; K. Maskus Intellectual Property \nRights in the Global Economy (2000) offers a good concise summary of the agreement, as does D. \nMatthews Globalising Intellectual Property Rights (2002), but also see my discussion in May A Global \nPolitical Economy of Intellectual Property Rights. \n12\n The Utopian literature is surveyed at some length in C.May The Information Society: A sceptical \nview (2002) \n(2004) 1:3 SCRIPT-ed \n \n412 \n \n1. The rule of law and markets \nIf modern law is \u2018a body of enacted laws; ...positive law, willed, made and given \nvalidity by the state itself in the exercise of its sovereignty\u2019, then we can assume that \nlaws do not develop spontaneously.\n13\n Laws recognise non-state activities or traditional \npractices, but can only be law in the sense of a society wide legal code through the \nexistence of legitimate political authority. Indeed, formalised law and the interests of \nthe state are inseparable: \u2018the law is a moral topography, a mapping of the social \nworld which normalises its preferred contours - and, equally importantly, suppresses \nor at best marginalises other ways of seeing and being\u2019.\n14\n By coding certain outcomes \nand practices as legal and others not, the state affects certain outcomes and legitimises \ncoercion against those practices not consistent with such an agenda. The capitalist \nstate constitutes much of society qua capitalist society through the legal forms it \nadopts to recognise and legitimise certain activities undertaken by contracting legal \nindividuals. Even when the law seems absent, private space still exists within the \njurisdictional space; the lack of rules in any specific instance is merely part of the \noverall current legal settlement and may change as the needs of capital change. \nPolitics is never absent from law\u2019s development: the enacted law is intricately tied up \nwith the interests and practices of the capitalist state. \nAs E.P. Thompson suggested: \u2018The greatest of all legal fictions is that the law itself \nevolves, from case to case, by its own impartial logic, true only to its own integrity, \nunswayed by expedient considerations\u2019.\n15\n This is not to suggest that the law merely \nreflects the needs and interests of the ruling class; it is not merely \u2018superstructure\u2019, \nrather Thompson argues that the \u2018imbrication\u2019 (overlapping) of law and productive \nrelations, means that legal institutions and the capitalist market economy are \ninterconnected and impossible to completely separate. At the same time that laws \nstructure productive relations (most obviously, but by no means exclusively, through \nproperty rights and legalised commodification), such law also changes in reaction to \nshifts in political economic relations mediated through the state\u2019s governing \napparatus, although such shifts are never automatic nor instrumental. This imbrication \nof law and productive relations is \u2018endorsed by norms\u2019 although such norms are \nalways subject to conflict and need to be constantly (re)produced.\n16\n The laws of the \ncapitalist state and the social relations of capitalist economic activity are not related in \na uni-directional manner but rather are intertwined in a simultaneous layering, each \none affecting the other.   \nWhile itself part of the ruling apparatus and part of the way the state legitimises itself, \nlaw is also the way a society co-ordinates its various demands, interests and actors. \nTherefore, it is impossible to imagine a developed and complex market society \n                                                 \n13\n G Poggi The Development of the Modern State (1978): 103 \n14\n P Corrigan and D Sayer \u201cHow The Law Rules: Variations on some themes in Karl Marx\u201d in B.

Laws which contradict social norms are \ndifficult to enforce and thus while states may try to shift such norms through laws \n(through welfare and social policy for instance), such moves cannot (at least in a \ndemocracy) be made too quickly or against serious social resistance. Markets are a \nsite of conflict over norms, contestation regarding acceptable practice, and the victory \nof particular interests. Frequently governments argue that they are required by \u2018the \nmarkets\u2019 to adopt certain practices (including regulatory systems). Such reification is \nmistaken: markets are the summation of the decisions (or perceived future decisions) \nof the actors whose economic interactions the market represents; markets do not act \nindependently of such decisions, although the outcomes are aggregated. \nThe law is therefore a site of contestation and reproduction of the state\u2019s ability to \nrule, and as such mediates between those it governs and the state itself, where those it \ngoverns are not limited to its own nationals but also include non-nationals operating \nwithin its jurisdiction. The law not only limits the actions of the ruled but the rulers as \nwell: the law \u2018may disguise the true realities of power, but at the same time... may \ncurb that power and check its intrusions\u2019.\n18\n Thompson was keen to emphasise that the \nRule of Law was an \u2018unqualified human good\u2019,\n19\n even while stressing the injustice of \nparticular laws. Thus, historically, one of the devices for countering resistance to the \nstate has been to limit such rule through legal limits on state activity. Property laws \nboth establish the state and protect property owners from the power of the state. Only \nby being seen as just can law rule without massive and continuing reinforcement \nthrough police action. The law and the state are intermingled; state governance \ndevelops using law to further particular interests within its jurisdiction, but also aware \nof the need to respond to resistance where the rule of law is too far removed from \ncommunity understandings of fairness, justice or customary practice.  \nWhile law is not merely an epiphenomena of social relations, it does reflect (in a \ncontested manner) the interests of certain groups more than others. Hence \nconsiderable political resources are deployed to establish certain \u2018common-sense\u2019 \nrights (most importantly for the argument here: the right to hold property in creative \nproducts, innovations and other forms of knowledge or information). In this sense the \nstate in its enactment of law is a site of contestation between competing groups whose \npower resources may be fundamentally unequal. Although the state favours those who \nserve its (economic and political) ends, their more extreme demands may be \ncompromised to protect the legitimacy of the overall legal structure. Now that I have \nlaid out why law might be central to capitalist societies\u2019 economic organisation, we \ncan focus on the key concern of this short essay; the commodification of information \nin the age of the Internet. \n2. The centrality of intellectual property law in the \u2018information age\u2019 \nCapitalism revolves around the relations between property holders, with many only \nhaving their labour (as property) to bring to the market. If capitalists are to make a \nprofit and therefore accumulate more capital as they must do if they are to reproduce \n                                                 \n17\n Thompson Whigs and Hunters: 260 \n18\n Thompson Whigs and Hunters: 265 \n19\n Thompson Whigs and Hunters: 266 \n(2004) 1:3 SCRIPT-ed \n \n414 \ntheir capital, they must find things from which they can extract the surplus value, via \nthe market. Most importantly these must be combined in various ways and then sold \nfor more than their collective cost. This requires a regime of property rights to allow \nfor the legally sanctioned transfer of resources (including labour) from one group to \nanother. Historically capitalists have managed to render many things as property, and \nthe expansion of IPRs represents merely another phase of their need to mobilise raw \nmaterials (their inputs) as legalised property. \nDespite the claims of Internet Utopians (who remain surprisingly influential in policy \ncircles), class differences based on ownership of the means of production have not \ndisappeared. In the information economy the ownership of valuable knowledge \nresources remains largely with the various segments of capital, while workers are \nallowed access to these resources only to work them. They may work on, and use, the \nknowledge and information that companies control but they are mostly unable to \nfinally own it. Employers use both legal and organisational techniques to ensure even \nsenior workers cannot legally retain extensive knowledge resources (or \u2018knowledge \ncapital\u2019) for their own use. \u2018Work-for-hire\u2019 provisions in intellectual property rights \nlaw (patent and copyright) allow the appropriation of the intellectual outputs of the \nworkforce by the contracting employer.\n20\n \nWhile the methods of extraction may have changed, the logic remains unaltered. Like \nmaterial property relations, intellectual property relations render output alienable and \ntherefore exchangeable in markets, they commodify knowledge and information for \ncapital\u2019s ends. The continuing deployment of technology has rendered intellectual \nactivity directly productive and has allowed the demystification of many economic \npractices. This is hardly novel. Karl Marx pointed out last century that, \neven down into the eighteenth century the different trades were called \n\u2018mysteries\u2019 [but] Modern Industry rent the veil that concealed from men \ntheir own social process of production, and that turned the various \nspontaneously divided branches of production into so many riddles, not \nonly to outsiders, but even to the initiated. The principle which [modern \nindustry] pursued, of resolving each process into its constituent movements, \nwithout any regard to their possible execution by the hand of man, created \nthe new modern science of technology.\n21\n \nTherefore, the move to reconstruct work into (commodified) tasks deliverable (at least \npartly) by machines is not part of the novelty of the information age, rather the \nrendering of \u2018skilled practices\u2019 as techniques is part of the characteristic logic of \ncapitalism. The logic of capitalism has prompted the development of expert systems \nand software to commodify and carry out many information-related jobs, and the \nencourages the organisation of these new tasks into new industrial sectors. \nFurthermore, companies frequently attempt to buy out those inventors who have \nmanaged to patent an idea, or rely on the increasingly expansive process of filing a \npatent to ensure that inventors find it hard to garner any protection for their \ninnovations, allowing its capture by capital. For copyright, similar difficulties for \n                                                 \n20\n This confusion is perhaps less pronounced in the work of Castells and other academic commentators, \nsee F Webster Theories of Information Society (Second edition) (2003) \n21\n K Marx, Capital.

Few authors can successfully muster the funds to not only produce \ncopies of their publication, but also mobilise the resources (from marketing to \ndistribution) that will support the widespread availability of their work. It is hardly \nself-evident that the Internet will change this situation: in the music industry, although \nthere have been attempts to record and distribute music outside the major global \nrecording companies, these companies remain the only route to large scale \ndistribution and potential rewards for the artist. Few if any \u2018unsigned\u2019 artists have \nbeen able to break into the global music market via Internet distribution and \nmarketing (despite a number of services utilising peer-to-peer technologies). In other \nareas of the \u2018creative\u2019 industries, it is the same; to secure significant distribution (and \ntherefore income) the originators or creators of knowledge- or information-related \nproducts need to assign the rights to their work to large companies, who then control \nthese rights for exploitation. \nOwnership and control of IPRs in capitalist enterprises is maintained through the \nconjunction of contract and property law. IPRs enable the enclosure of specific ideas \ninto \u2018properties\u2019 while service and employment contracts ensure the control of these \nproperties lies with capitalists, not the creators themselves.\n22\n As the celebrants of the \n\u2018new economy\u2019 continually remind us, the new tools of work are located in the mind, \nbut when these tools produce discrete ideas, products of innovations, labour contracts \nwith IPR provisions aim to enclose such knowledge as the property of the employer.\n 23\n \nIntellectual property therefore allows the separation of the individual from the \nproducts of their own mind, it reproduces the alienation of the worker from the \nproduct of their labour that was central to Marx\u2019s characterisation of capitalist \ncommodification of labour. \nMarx placed the \u2018making\u2019 of property, or commodification, at the centre of his \nanalysis of capitalism: this is the appearance of relations between individuals as a \nrelationship between things. (Of course, one might argue that the making of property \nfrom information and knowledge is more akin to primitive accumulation than to \ncommodification, but I shall leave this aside here.) Capitalism has progressively \ndeepened its penetration into previously non-commodified social relations. However, \nwe must clearly distinguish markets from capitalism. Markets are a device, embedded \nwithin society, for the co-ordination of demand and supply which produces prices that \nenable exchange mediated by money of goods that have been socially produced. This \ncontrasts with capitalism, which intervenes in the economy by producing goods or \nservices specifically for profit, speculatively. The capitalist earns a socially \nrecognised (and legitimated) return on investment (enabling capital to be reproduced \nand accumulated) when items are brought to market and successfully sold. Market \neconomies can exist without capitalism and have done so, but capitalism cannot exist \noutside a market economy. \nThis analytical separation enables changes in the form of market relations (most \nspecifically the sorts of commodities and services brought to market) to be \ndistinguished from the driving organisational logic of capitalists acting in the market \nitself. If we accept that markets are not the same as capitalism, then while they are \n                                                 \n22\n Space precludes a discussion of the associated problems of information enclosure. For an excellent \nrecent collection of articles, see: J. Boyle The Public Domain (66 Law and Contemporary Problems: \nspecial issue) (2003). \n23\n May The Information Society: 51-66 \n(2004) 1:3 SCRIPT-ed \n \n416 \ninter-related, changes in the market\u2019s character do not indicate necessary changes in \nthe \u2018laws of motion\u2019 of capitalism. The character of the economy may change due to \ntechnological or social changes, and this may expand or contract the possibilities for \ncapitalistic intervention, but it does not change the reproductive cycles of capital \nitself. The claimed shift from physical products to \u2018virtual\u2019 services is a shift within \ncapitalism, not the emergence of some new political economic form. \nTechnologies can change without any necessary corresponding shift in the way the \neconomy is organised: the Internet, in this sense, is merely a new form of (marketised) \nspace for capitalist relations to operate within. The ability to interact over the Internet \nis subject to property relations. Time on-line is sold, not free; where it seems \u2018free\u2019 \neither through the University, or in public access booths in libraries, it has still been \ncommodified. Free access merely means the commodity has been purchased \nelsewhere (in bulk by the university of library service) or supplied as part of a \nsubscription package. In the information age, access is property (whatever the claims \nmade regarding the free flow of information), much as it has been throughout the \nperiod when information was delivered through books, over the radio or TV. \nWhile the technologies and practices of capitalism in the market have changed in \nform, the underlying property relations - those between labour owning and capital \nowning groups - remain in substance unaltered. This represents a remarkable and \ncrucial continuity, not evidence for a revolutionary new information age as many \nInternet ideologues suggest. Indeed, it is this continuity of the capitalist logic that \nseems to be wilfully hidden by much of the discourse regarding the emergence of the \ninformation society, and the \u2018new economy\u2019. The nascent information society has \nalready seen the expansion of the private rights accorded to information and \nknowledge owners rather than their evaporation, not least through the globalisation of \nIPRs under the TRIPs\/WTO legal settlement. Information or knowledge may have an \nexistence outside the privately owned realm, but this is increasingly a residual \ncategory, only recognised when all conceivable private rights have been established. \n3. The capitalist state and the (re)production of information inequality \nThe laws of intellectual property are required by information capitalists, but are also \ncontested by many social groups. In this area the continuing power and importance of \nthe capitalist state stands revealed. Property qua property does not pre-exist the \napparatus of government (or the state), waiting to be recognised legally; rather the \nlegal recognition of property constitutes its existence in a form that can be identified \nas property. Only the law can mandate the rights that \u2018owners\u2019 can claim: possession \nis not property in a legal sense, especially as regards information or knowledge. \nThe key legal right that extends to the owner of property is the right to \u2018control the \nactions of others in respect to the objects of property\u2019.\n24\n Most significantly this \nincludes: the ability to charge rent for use; to receive compensation for loss; and \npayment for transfer. Thus, the control of other economic actors is maintained by the \nlegal ability to exact a price for any specific action regarding such (intellectual) \nproperty. It is these rights that form the institution of property rather than the specific \nstuff (object or idea) to which a property right is attached. And although the institution \nof property is established enough in modern societies that the sanction of the state to \n                                                 \n24\n R T Ely Property and Contract in their Relations to the Distribution of Wealth (1914): 132 \n(2004) 1:3 SCRIPT-ed \n \n417 \nsupport or enforce this control is seldom needed, behind the acceptance of property by \nthose conducting social relations lies the strength of the state. These property rights \nmust be robust as the central requirement of capitalism is the ability to contract for \nsale (i.e. transfer of property) and for work (the labour\/employer relation). Without \nthis possibility, the alienation of goods (for sale) and the alienation of labour (to \nprovide capital with work) would be impossible to maintain without recourse to force.  \nWhereas physical property has something of a natural scarcity, this scarcity needs to \nbe constructed by the state in the case of intellectual property. Without the legal \nconstruction of intellectual property, the scarcity of knowledge or information that \nproduces a price in the market would be difficult if not impossible to establish. And \nwithout law the ability of the owner of intellectual property to contract for its use \n(either though licensing or sale for use-only) would be equally compromised. That the \nstate as final guarantor of intellectual property faces no real competitors is further \nsuggested by the private sector\u2019s demands, made concrete through TRIPs, to \ninstitutionalise sufficient protection for their property. At the centre of TRIPs is a \nradical widening and institutionalisation of state authority, from search and seizure \nbased merely on the possibility of infringement, to the introduction of patent laws in \nsectors (such as pharmaceuticals) where for years developing countries have refused \nto implement protection. For information age entrepreneurs, like all profit-driven \nmarket actors, the protection of property is the sine qua non of successful activities. \nPerhaps most invidiously this protection has gone from being an area of (potential) \nlegal debate to a problem of technical specification. Having been frustrated by various \ncourts (in both Europe and America) continuing to recognise some notion of fair use \nfor information and knowledge, many \u2018owners\u2019 have sought recourse in Digital Rights \nManagement (DRM) technologies.\n25\n Whereas, for much of the recent history of \ncopyright there has been a legal space carved out for free public use of information \nand knowledge, encoded \u2018fair use\u2019 in law, new DRM technologies have tried to \ncircumscribe such use quite severely. In the past certain uses, such as copying extracts \nfor educational use, and the utilisation of copyright material for research purposes, \nwas frequently legal in certain clearly defined circumstances. DRM halts this use \nwithout the explicit agreement (and usually payment to) the rights owner. \nFurthermore, both the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in the US and the EC \nDirective on Copyright in Europe explicitly criminalise any attempt to circumnavigate \nsuch technical controls even if this is to allow legally sanctioned \u2018fair use\u2019. These \ntechnologies are intended to ensure that digital source material cannot be duplicated, \ntransferred from machine to machine, or even used in many cases, without the express \nconsent of owners. While this is already having some effect on the developed world\u2019s \nsoftware and music markets, the potential impact on the transfer of knowledge to \nlesser developed countries is severe. \nIn the past many poor countries have essentially relied on what copyright owners\u2019 \nregard as mass piracy. Utilising cheap copying facilities, textbooks and research \nworks have been duplicated and passed around from hand to hand. While on one side \nthe digitalisation of source materials, we are told, will ease the flows of information \naround the global system (provided users have the appropriate computer technology, \nof course), DRM also ensures that there will be less uncontrolled usage. The ability to \nreproduce material outside international agreements on copyright will become more \n                                                 \n25\n C May \u201cDigital rights management and the breakdown of social norms\u201d 8 First Monday 2003 @ \nhttp:\/\/firstmonday.org\/issues\/issues8_11\/may\/index.html  \n(2004) 1:3 SCRIPT-ed \n \n418 \ndifficult, and certainly where information appears in expensive journals (this is \nespecially true of scientific knowledge) almost impossible. This has prompted moves \nby George Soros\u2019 Open Society Institute among others to start to encourage and \nsupport the dissemination of scientific information and research results through \u2018open \nsource\u2019 journals that are free to end users, which can then be duplicated at will. How \nsuccessful this will be in the face of the concerted efforts of many content owning \ncorporations  to assert expanded controls over their \u2018assets\u2019 remains to be seen. \nCertainly the support for these open source initiatives from the academic community \nhas been both forthright and quite extensive, leading one to hope (at least) that the \ncommodification of information delivered over the Internet is not a unidirectional \ndynamic. \nNevertheless at present the use of DRMs and the protection from circumnavigation \nthrough law is working to ensure that those countries that need information the most, \nfor developmental and welfare purposes and whose population in general does not \nhave the wealth to access the Internet will find their access to vital information \nconstrained. However, because so many states have signed up to the TRIPs \nagreement, as part of the general accession to the WTO, the possibilities of diplomatic \nresistance remain constrained as the slow and grudging movement on pharmaceutical \npatents after the Doha Ministerial Declaration on TRIPs and Public Health has \ndemonstrated. Not only did this statement on the use of generic drugs in heath crises \ntake many months to negotiate, producing merely a restatement of the position in \nTRIPs in any case, but the key issue of cross-border supply of generic AIDS-drugs to \ncountries with no domestic capacity has only recently been partly resolved. \n4. Resisting information commodification \nThe claim that states are no longer effective actors (and hence subjecting them to \npolitical pressure is a waste of time) has conveniently omitted the state\u2019s role as \nguarantor of the legislative infrastructure that underlies market activity. The declinist \nposition represents an ideological acceptance (or reification) of the \u2018naturalness\u2019 of \nmarkets, a denial of states\u2019 extensive legal activities in supporting the free market. If \nthis is forgotten then the state might seem to be less involved in social exchanges than \nin the past; the reification of the market has resulted in a denial of the state\u2019s historic \nrole in the political economy. By removing the state from accounts of the market, the \ninformation society can be presented as a challenge to the state. However, the state is \ncritically required to legally support the markets of the \u2018new economy\u2019, and while its \nmeans of market intervention may have changed, this is not the same as withdrawal. \nThere have certainly been considerable shifts and changes, yet capitalist states remain \ncrucial to the (re)production of the economic system. With no state it would be \ndifficult for capitalist commodification to continue. \nIn the foreseeable future the capitalist state will remain the key actor in the global \nsystem, and as such must also remain the key target of political action. The political \ndenial of efficacy in the face of the globalisation of the information society is an \nideological mask for the continuation of rule on behalf of capital. However, an \nimportant distinction is widening between those states able to mobilise the rule of law \nand offer the legal regimes required for information based economic activity and \nthose states who have difficulty even maintaining the territorial aspects of statehood. \nWhere law has broken down, or alternatively never been established, the resource \ncommitment needed to maintain a semblance of order reduces the possibility of the \n(2004) 1:3 SCRIPT-ed \n \n419 \ndevelopment of any jurisdictional space by the state, let alone a informationalised \none.\n26\n While the powerful states continue to ensure their capitalists\u2019 (intellectual) \nproperty is safe-guarded, others will be increasingly threatened by the information \nage\u2019s commodification of their remaining national resources by international Capital \n(through bio-piracy and the \u2018theft\u2019 of traditional knowledge, for instance). Thus, the \n\u2018information age\u2019 both enhances the power of states that can effectively control their \njurisdiction, and contributes to the weakness of those that do not. \nThe history of IPRs has been a political battle to balance the rights of owners with the \nvery important social benefits that flow from social availability of information and \nknowledge. While in the period following TRIPs there has been a clear expansion in \nthe rights of owners, this is not a necessary unidirectional dynamic. Commodification \ncan be resisted through civil disobedience (of which down-loading MP3 files is \nmerely a rather facile example). The circulation of information and knowledge \nthrough open-source communities is an important move in the direction of \ndecommodification which tries to wrest the often proclaimed social(ist) possibilities \nof the Internet from the clutches of the capitalist companies that largely control it. \nFurthermore, given the state\u2019s central role in supporting commodification (and the \ncontrol of informational resources through for instance the support for DRMs), it is \nstill worth seeking to organise political pressure to reassert the historical precedents \nwithin IPR law for \u2018fair use\u2019.  \nAt its most basic such campaigns need to concentrate on limiting the use of DRMs (or \nat least constraining the legal codification and protection of their use-limiting \ncapabilities) and re-establishing the information commons as a public domain for the \nnascent global society. Like the environmental movement, the value of the global \n(knowledge) commons must be (re)asserted against the \u2018logic\u2019 of continued \ncommodification of (informational) resources. To widen access to information, there \nalso is a real need to support plain text usage and to resist the constant upgrading of \nsoftware for content generation. Even where those in developing countries have \nsecured access to ICTs there is often considerable technological lag. By ensuring that \ninformation is distributed in easily backwards compatible forms, flows outside the \nhigh-tech enclaves of the west can be encouraged. However, at its most basic, to resist \nthe commodification of information, pass it on freely wherever you can.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n26\n see the recent discussion in F Fukuyama State Building: Governance and World Order in the Twenty \nFirst Century (2004) \n"}
