INTRODUCTION\nTurbulence is a far-from-equilibrium state of a nonlinear\nphysical system whose energy distribution extends over\nmany degrees of freedom. The most important physical pro-\ncess in turbulence is that of energy transformation to heat,\nvia dissipation, starting from the form of energy that is being\npumped into the system from an external source. The turbu-\nlence behavior may be defined by the physical nature of the\nprocesses providing the energy pumping and energy transfor-\nmation. In this sense we may distinguish between kinetic,\nconvectional, and acoustic turbulence. These are described\nby similar nonlinear equations, but their driving and inertial\nforces are different in nature, and there are different reasons\nfor the instabilities in the motion of the media, and different\nprocesses of energy transformation. In each case, however,\nthe dissipative process is the viscosity of the medium. Ki-\nnetic turbulence in a moving fluid appears when the inertial\neffects of motion are greatly dominant over viscous forces\u2014\nthe situation of high Reynolds numbers. Convective turbu-\nlence appears for steady heating of a liquid in a gravitational\nfield, when the ratio between the Archimedean and viscous\nforces becomes large \u0001high Rayleigh numbers\u0002. A similar\nsituation arises in a medium for which with the dependence\nof wave velocity on amplitude becomes nonlinear for waves\nof large amplitude. Nonlinear effects then dominate over dis-\nsipative processes \u0001high acoustic Reynolds numbers\u0002. This is\nthe case of acoustic turbulence. It is characterized by steep-\nening of the wave at either front or back, leading to the\nformation of wave breakdown and shock waves and to the\ncreation of high-frequency harmonics of an initially har-\nmonic driving force.\nFor turbulence in an incompressible liquid, for example,\nkinetic energy is pumped in through external mechanical\nforcing and is finally dissipated by viscosity. As suggested by\nRichardson \u00031\u0004, the kinetic energy at first flows in a\ndissipation-free manner towards successively smaller length\nscales. This is called the inertial interval. The cascadelike\nenergy transfer process is eventually terminated by viscous\ndamping, once the Reynolds number approaches unity. On\neach length scale it is possible to attribute a frequency to the\ncorresponding excitation mode.\nThe process of energy transformation through the inertial\ninterval is dependent on interactions between the different\nmodes. These are described as weak, giving rise to weak\nturbulence, in cases when the energy exchange \u0003E in the\ninteraction process is much less than the energy E of each\nmode. Strong turbulence is the opposite case, where \u0003E\n\u0005E.\nFrom a theoretical point of view, the simplest case is the\nturbulence of weakly interacting waves, when there is strong\ndispersion of waves in the medium but the mutual interac-\ntions of the wave packets are weak, and the phases of the\ndifferent waves are consequently random \u00032,3\u0004. This approxi-\nmation allows us to develop a statistical description for a\nvery wide class of pumping forces. The cascade idea ex-\nplains the basic macroscopic manifestation of turbulence:\nThe mean rate of viscous energy dissipation does not depend\non viscosity at large Reynolds numbers.\nThe statistics of the velocity fluctuation distribution in\nturbulent flows was quantified by Kolmogorov \u00034,5\u0004, who\nderived the \u201c\u22125 \/3 law\u201d for the energy spectrum at interme-\ndiate scales Ek\u0005k\u22125\/3, within the inertial interval of high\nReynolds number flows. In the ideal case, the energy density\nis homogeneous \u0001statistically invariant under translation\u0002 and\nisotropic \u0001statistically invariant under rotation and reflection\u0002\nin the three Cartesian velocity dimensions. One-dimensional\nweak turbulence with a constant energy flux P is described\nby the relationship \u00036\u0004\nEk \u0005 P1\/3k\u22125\/2\nin the case of \u0004k= \u0006k\u0006a for a\u00051, where processes of the type\n\u0004k\u2194\u0004k1 +\u0004k2 +\u0004k3 are significant, amounting to say \u000515%*victor\u0001efimov@yahoo.co.uk\nPHYSICAL REVIEW E 78, 066611 \u00012008\u0002\n1539-3755\/2008\/78\u00016\u0002\/066611\u00016\u0002 \u00a92008 The American Physical Society066611-1\nof all interactions. They result in a stationary energy flux to\nthe high-frequency edge of the spectrum where dissipation\noccurs. The wave amplitude of weak turbulence in the iner-\ntial interval is expected to exhibit statistics close to Gaussian.\nOne example of weak turbulence is the interaction of\nwaves on the surface of a fluid \u00037,8\u0004. The turbulent nature of\nthe surface waves is very close to the case of acoustic\nturbulence\u2014nonlinear dispersive waves propagate along the\nfluid surface and form a weak, interacting wave packet sub-\nject to negligible dissipation. The statistical behavior of a\nsurface wave can be described within the framework of the\nrandom wave theory \u00039\u0004.\nStrong turbulence corresponds to the case where the as-\nsumption of weak interaction between harmonic waves does\nnot apply. The time of interaction between different wave\nmodes is then comparable to the time of wave propagation\nand the waves are cophasal. Intense acoustic waves in media\nwith high nonlinearity, weak dissipation, and weak \u0001or ab-\nsent\u0002 dispersion provide typical examples of strong turbu-\nlence \u000310,11\u0004. The propagation of dispersionless nonlinear\nwaves is described by Burgers\u2019 equation \u000312\u0004 and in a one-\ndimensional geometry can be written as\ndu\ndt\n+ u\ndu\ndx\n= \u0006\nd2u\ndx2\n,\nwhere \u0006 is the coefficient of dissipation. Strong interactions\nbetween the harmonics leads to wave disturbance and the\nformation of shock waves \u000313\u0004. The origin of the traveling\nwaves is the same\u2014some external force, which in the case of\nsecond sound is a periodic heating by selected shape of sig-\nnal from a generator. Theoretical investigation of the ran-\ndomly forced Burgers\u2019 equation has shown \u000314\u0004 that the ve-\nlocity gradient should have a probability density function\n\u0001PDF\u0002 with a power-law dependence on the velocity gradi-\nent. If the system is excited by noise, a statistically average\nrandom signal is to be expected, which subsequently trans-\nforms due to the nonlinearity in the wave velocity. Higher\npulses merge with smaller ones during the process of wave\npropagation \u000315\u0004. This reformation drastically changes the\nstatistically average random distribution to a nonequilibrium\none.\nAny harmonic wave launched into a medium with a non-\nlinear dependence of wave velocity on amplitude must even-\ntually transform towards sawtooth waves. Its main dissipa-\ntive processes arise though the formation of shocks \u000316\u0004,\nwith dissipation acting to smooth the breakdown of the\nwave. The extreme case in the transformation of a harmonic\nnonlinear wave is a sawtooth shaped wave\nu\u0006\u0001t\u0002\u00060\n2\u0007\n= u0 + \u0007\nn=1\n\b 1\nn\u0007\nsin\u0001n\u0004t\u0002 .\nThe energy spectrum of such a wave is similar to the Kol-\nmogorov spectrum E\u0004\u0005\u0004\u22122, though the component harmon-\nics of this wave are cophasal and the PDF is a flat uniform\ndistribution. This distribution differs from the case of weakly\ninteracting wave modes, and the random phases of the sinu-\nsoidal modes justifies a statistical approach to the wave in-\nteractions.\nIn this paper we report the results of an experimental\nstudy of the statistical behavior of nonlinear second sound\nwaves in superfluid 4He in a quasi-one-dimensional resona-\ntor pumped by a harmonic signal. The resonant conditions\nallow us to raise the amplitude of the standing wave suffi-\nciently to facilitate investigation of the influence of nonlin-\nearity, but without significant disturbance of the medium by\nthe net heat flux from the emitter. The standing wave in the\nresonator can be described by the sum of two counterpropa-\ngating waves periodically pumped by the emitter. Given the\nstrong nonlinearity of the medium, such waves would adopt\na sawtooth shape as the limiting case of wave transforma-\ntion. The PDF of their sum is a nonequilibrium one. In what\nfollows, we study the PDF of such standing waves in a\nhigh-Q \u0001quality factor\u0002 resonator and try to understand how\nstrongly the different multiple modes in the resonator are\nmutually correlated.\nII. EXPERIMENTS\nThe velocity c2 of a second sound wave in He II depends\nstrongly on its amplitude \tT and can be approximated as\nc2 = c20\u00011 + \n\tT\u0002 ,\nwhere c20 is the wave velocity at negligibly small amplitude,\n\tT is the wave amplitude, and \n is the nonlinearity coeffi-\ncient of the second sound velocity.\nThere are huge advantages in the use of roton second\nsound waves in He II for model studies of acoustic turbu-\nlence. Within the experimentally convenient temperature\nrange 2.17\u20131.5 K the nonlinearity coefficient \n can be\ntuned, just by changing the bath temperature: \n\u2192\u2212\b near\nthe normal-to-superfluid transition T\u000b=2.17 K; \n passes\nthrough zero at T\n=1.88 K; and \n\u0005 +2 K\u22121 at T\u00051.5 K\n\u000317\u0004. Thus one can study the dynamics of both nearly linear\nand strongly nonlinear waves with positive \u0001such as conven-\ntional sound\u0002 or negative nonlinearity while using exactly the\nsame experimental techniques. The experiments at T=T\n al-\nlow us to study the propagation of waves of high intensity\nfor the case of a cubic nonlinearity. Such possibilities are\nunavailable in conventional experiments. Second sound\nwaves have only a tiny dispersion in the lower frequency\nrange below 1 MHz. The fact that the velocity of second\nsound u20\f20 m \/s is more than an order of magnitude less\nthan the velocity of conventional sound in gases and in con-\ndensed media allows us to increase the time resolution of the\nmeasurements.\nDetails of the experimental design have been given else-\nwhere \u000318,19\u0004 but, briefly, the resonator was formed from a\nquartz tube of diameter \u000515 mm and length L=70 mm. Its\ntwo ends were capped by a thin film heater and supercon-\nducting Cu+Sn bolometer \u000320\u0004, respectively. A meander strip\nheater provided a spatially uniform heat flux. The bolometer\nhad a sensitivity of up to \u000510 V \/K. An external magnetic\nfield was used to adjust the temperature of its maximum\nsensitivity. The heater was driven by an external sinusoidal\nvoltage generator within the frequency range 0.1\u2013100 kHz.\nThe frequency of the second sound emitted from the heater\n\u00012 times the frequency of the voltage generator\u0002 was set\nEFIMOV, GANSHIN, AND MCCLINTOCK PHYSICAL REVIEW E 78, 066611 \u00012008\u0002\n066611-2\nequal to one of the longitudinal resonant frequencies of the\ncavity. It should be borne in mind in what follows that some\nradial modes may also have been excited due to small non-\nidealities of the cell construction.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nGiven the high Q of the resonator, a sufficiently high sinu-\nsoidal drive amplitude leads to the formation of multiple\ndiscrete harmonics. Energy is thus transformed, moving from\nthe driving frequency towards the high-frequency edge of the\nspectrum, where it then dissipates due to viscosity and im-\nperfections of the resonator, i.e., a Kolmogorov-like cascade\nas shown in Fig. 1. Such behavior is a distinctive feature of\nturbulent processes.\nWe determined the statistics of standing waves in the\nresonator experimentally at T=2.08 K by analysis of a de-\nveloped acoustic cascade with multiple harmonics \u000322,23\u0004.\nThe main harmonic comes of course from the excitation by\nthe driving signal and is cophasal with the pumping excita-\ntion. The driving signal may affect the first few higher har-\nmonics until the mutual interactions of the higher modes\ndeemphasize the influence of the phase of the pumping sig-\nnal. We therefore used a digital filter to eliminate the lower\nharmonics and computed the PDF of the rest of the signal.\nThe resultant changes in shape of the signal are shown in\nFig. 2, the corresponding changes in its PDF are shown in\nFig. 4, and Fig. 3 for those in the filtered spectra.\nIt is evident that, as expected, the main harmonic is de-\nfined by the resonant driving signal and corresponds to a\nstrongly distorted sine wave. The PDF of its main harmonic\nis similar to that of a sine wave. The driving signal also\ninfluences directly the next first harmonics, but fades out for\nthe higher harmonics. Filtration of the low-frequency har-\nmonics transforms a PDF from one that is close to that of a\nsine wave to the Gaussian-like distribution shown in Fig. 4,\nwhich is characteristic of arbitrary wave fields. The intensity\nof noise in the measurement system was an order of magni-\ntude less than the random fluctuations in second sound inten-\nsity. Although the PDF of the signal was approximately\nGaussian after removal of the lower harmonics, some asym-\nmetry was visible in all measurements, as shown in Fig. 4.\nIts origin is evident in the nonsinusoidal shape of the re-\ncorded signals as shown, e.g., in Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002. The heating peak\nis accompanied by distinctive breakdowns at the front or tail\nFIG. 1.

Com-\nparable asymmetry was observed for first sound resonances\nin closed tubes \u000324\u0004, as well as for heating and cooling shock\nwaves in superfluid helium \u000325\u0004 and measurements of the\nPDF of capillary surface waves \u00039\u0004. In the present case, be-\ncause the minima in \tT are more rounded than the maxima,\nthere is a corresponding asymmetry in the PDF. It decreases\nfor the higher harmonics but does not completely disappear\nwithin the experimentally accessible range.\nThe extent to which the Gaussian distribution is devel-\noped corresponds to the extent of development of the turbu-\nlent energy cascade: The more developed the energy cascade,\nthe closer the PDF becomes to a Gaussian distribution. Fig-\nure 5\u0001a\u0002 shows the PDF after removal of the main harmonic\n\u0001circles\u0002, and after removal of both it and the second har-\nmonic \u0001triangles\u0002 which clearly brings it closer to being\nGaussian in shape.

The quasi-one-dimensional lon-\ngitudinal waves in the resonator have three- and four-wave\ninteractions. The energy transformation to higher frequencies\n\u0001Kolmogorov-like cascade\u0002 is the result of three-wave inter-\naction: \u0004d+\u00041\u2192\u00042, causing the amplitudes of the higher\nharmonic to increase towards their equilibrium values.\nThe increasing amplitudes of the higher harmonics leads\nto intensive interactions between the independent modes\nwithin the framework of three-or four-wave processes \u0004d\n+\u00041\u2194\u00042 and \u0004d+\u00041\u2194\u00042+\u00043; there will be similar inter-\nactions not involving waves at the driving frequency. Such\nprocesses will lead to substantial mixing of the phases of the\nhigher frequency modes, which will therefore be less af-\nfected by that of the driving force.\nWe also investigated the effect of increasing the number\nof wave interactions by adding an additional excitation to the\nsystem. Pumping the system by two signals from two sepa-\nrate sine wave generators launches four waves 2\u000f f1G, 2\n\u000f f2G, f1G\u2212 f2G, and f1G+ f2G into the resonator. With pump-\ning only at the 31st resonance, a developed cascade was\nformed as shown in Fig. 6\u0001a\u0002. The addition of a weak exci-\ntation at a lower frequency changes the picture substantially.\nThe interactions of the resultant four waves give rise to nu-\nmerous combinational signals, as shown in Fig. 6\u0001b\u0002. Fur-\nthermore, interactions between the main and combinational\nwaves lead to attenuation of the developed turbulent cascade\nand change the distribution function within the inertial inter-\nval \u000326\u0004. Suppression of the main turbulent cascade is indi-\ncated by a change in the frequency dependence of the spec-\ntral maxima from A\u000e f\u22121.79 in \u0001a\u0002 to A\u000e f\u22122.18 in \u0001b\u0002.

A similar effect was observed for the system\nof surface waves on liquid hydrogen \u000327\u0004.\nThe appearance of a set of combinational waves, and the\nincreasing number of interactions between the different har-\nmonics, lead to the formation of a Gaussian-like PDF in the\nhigher spectral range. The result of cutting the spectrum of\nthe signal below fc=5900 Hz is shown in Fig. 7. Note that\nthe frequency cut \u0001arrows in Fig. 6\u0002 is made below the sec-\nond harmonic of the developed cascade with a single excita-\ntion signal.\nFinally, we enter two caveats in relation to the above dis-\ncussion. First, we note that the resonant frequency of the\nforcing signal differs slightly from the frequency of free os-\ncillation due to the presence of the small heat flux from the\nheater \u000328\u0004. Thus, the wavelength of the driving signal at\nresonance is not exactly equal to the wavelength of the trav-\neling wave corresponding to the eigenfrequency in the cavity\nand the integer length of higher harmonics. Correspondingly,\nthe influence of the phase of the driving force diminishes in\nthe higher harmonics. The effect is clearly visible for our\nso-called \u201celeventh resonance\u201d \u0001Fig. 5\u0002, which we suspect is\ncoupled to the first radial resonance \u0001see above\u0002: The fre-\nquencies of the fundamental radial mode and higher radial\nmodes are incommensurate. Second, the differing velocities\ncorresponding to the different amplitudes of the harmonics in\nthe cascade mean that the phases and resonant frequencies of\nthe different modes are slightly different from those ex-\npected.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nThe main conclusion is that the removal of low-frequency\ncomponents in the signal from turbulent second sound in our\nresonator yields probability densities with Gaussian-like dis-\ntributions: With successive removal of the lower harmonics,\nthe strong influence of the driving signal \u0001with cophasal be-\nhavior\u0002 weakens, and the PDF changes from the shape cor-\nresponding to a sine wave towards a Gaussian distribution,\nrepresenting the statistical average of random multiple har-\nmonics. It was already known that the Kolmogorov-like\npower-frequency distribution arising from a high-intensity\npumping signal takes the form Ai\u000e\u0004\u2212n, where n\u00051.5. More\nintense driving yields a lower value of the power n, a longer\ninertial interval, and relatively larger amplitude of higher\nharmonics \u000323\u0004. We have also found that, under some cir-\ncumstances, an inverse energy cascade can exist, carrying\nwave energy towards lower frequencies \u000329\u0004. We have now\nshown that, although the driving signal exerts a strong influ-\nence on the first few harmonics in the resonator, this influ-\nence quickly dies out in the higher harmonics where the\nPDFs become nearly Gaussian, apparently corresponding to\nchaoticlike behavior. Such phenomena are to be anticipated\nin wave turbulent systems quite generally but, to our knowl-\nedge, have not previously been demonstrated experimentally.\nPumping the system with an additional weak excitation\nleads to the formation of numerous combinational waves,\nand a partial suppression of the main energy cascade. The\ninteraction between the combinational waves and the main\ndriving signal shifts the region with a Gaussian-like PDF\ntowards lower frequencies. Thus, the form of acoustic turbu-\nlence revealed by the experiments apparently exhibits the\nfeatures of both strong wave interaction and weak turbu-\nlence.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe acknowledge valuable discussions with G.
