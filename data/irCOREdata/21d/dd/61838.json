Introduction \n \nThe characteristics of urban air pollution have changed significantly over recent decades. \nConcentrations of traditionally important pollutants such as sulphur dioxide (SO2) and black smoke \nhave declined substantially, whilst road traffic emissions have emerged as the major cause of poor air \nquality (Brophy et al, 2007). The urban environment contains a complex mixture of air pollutants, the \nexact composition of which varies both over time and between individual towns and cities due to \nchanges in patterns and sources of emissions. Typically, however, urban air quality is dominated by \nemissions from road traffic. \nDiesel and petrol fuelled vehicles are responsible for the generation of a wide range of \npollutants, with concentrations and relative proportions of pollutants depending on vehicle \ntechnology and operating conditions (Colvile et al., 2001). In terms of their effects on plants and their \nrelatively high concentrations in exhaust emissions, nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are \nthe most important phytotoxic pollutants associated with road transport. However, trace amounts of \nother nitrogen-containing compounds such as nitrous acid (HONO), nitrous oxide (N2O) and \nammonia (NH3) may also be present in vehicle emissions. During combustion, other pollutants, \nincluding sulphur dioxide (SO2) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), are emitted, together with \ncarbonaceous particles from incompletely burnt fuel droplets (Colvile et al., 2001). \nIn the urban environment NO is oxidised to NO2 through reaction with ozone (O3). In the \nopen atmosphere this reaction occurs rapidly. However, close to large sources of NO, such as busy \nroad junctions and street canyons, the supply of O3 may be rapidly exhausted and a large proportion \nof the NO left unoxidised, leading to characteristically high levels of this pollutant in these areas \n(AQEG, 2004). \n  4\nPrevious research has shown that at high concentrations, many of the pollutants present in exhaust \ngases can be damaging to plants (Ackerly & Bazzaz, 1995; Grantz et al., 2003; Wellburn, 1990). \nMuch of this research has, however, looked solely at the individual components of exhaust emissions \nand there is very little information on the impacts of the particular mix of pollutants characteristic of \nurban areas. \nThe ecological effects of roads and traffic have been recently reviewed by Spellerberg (1998) \nand Bignal et al. (2004). Measurable plant responses to traffic emissions have been reported in a \nnumber of studies using either transects away from roads or exposures to different traffic densities. \nFor example, Angold (1997) and Bernhardt-Romermann et al (2006) reported changes in plant \ncommunity composition with increasing proximity to roadsides in England and Germany, \nrespectively. Gratani et al. (2000) reported positive relationships between traffic density and \nphotosynthetic activity, stomatal conductance, total chlorophyll content and leaf senescence of \nQuercus ilex L. in Rome. In a similar study in Finland, Viskari et al. (2000b) also related changes in \nepistomatal wax structure to traffic density. These studies highlight the diversity of plant responses \nassociated with environments adjacent to busy roadsides.  \nAlthough fumigation experiments with exhaust gases under controlled conditions have tended \nto confirm the findings from field studies (Bahl & Kahl, 1995; Kammerbauer & Dick, 2000; Viskari \net al., 2000a,c; Weil & Schaub, 1999), a major criticism of all these experiments is their short \nduration (generally < 20 days). It is not possible to determine the implications of long-term exposure \nto realistic concentrations of vehicle emissions from such short-term studies.  \nThe study reported in this paper makes use of a unique pollution exposure system that was \ndesigned to expose plants to stable and realistic concentrations of urban pollutants under near \nambient conditions of light, temperature and humidity. The long-term stability of the system allowed \nexperiments to take place over entire growing seasons and to be repeated from year to year. During \nthe three year period from 2000-2003, a range of plant species of different morphologies and \n  5\nfunctional types, including trees, shrubs, herbaceous vegetation and bryophytes, were exposed to \nvehicle exhaust emissions. Ashenden et al. (2003) summarise some of the key findings from the \noverall research programme, highlighting effects of pollutant exposure on the growth, physiology and \nphenology and of a number of plant species. The current paper provides a detailed description of \npollutant conditions and their effects on 12 common herbaceous plant species. The overall aim of this \nstudy was to evaluate the effects of exposure to a realistic mixture of urban air pollutants on the \ngrowth, phenology and leaf surface characteristics of native herbaceous vegetation.  \n \n2. Materials and Methods \n2.1. Fumigation system \nThe solardome fumigation facility was situated at the Henfaes Farm site of the University of Wales, \nBangor (National Grid Ref. SH 654732) in North Wales. The facility was developed from an earlier \nfumigation system described in detail in Rafarel & Ashenden (1991). The system consisted of four \nSolardome\u00ae 1 glasshouses (Solardome Industries Ltd, Southampton, Hampshire), constructed on an \neast-west line. The domes had a diameter of 3.1m and a floor area of 7.55m2. Each dome was 2.11m \nhigh and had an internal volume of 12.0m3. \nAir was circulated through the domes using fan filter units (Roof Unit Group, West Midlands, \nUK) fitted with activated charcoal filters. Control solardomes received charcoal-filtered air. The \ncomplex mixture of pollutants characteristic of roadside urban environments was simulated in \nreplicate polluted domes, using the exhaust emissions from a 3.5 Kw diesel generator (Generac\u00ae ED \n4000, Lombardini, Italy). An earlier feasibility study (Moonen et al., 1999) had demonstrated that \nemissions from a diesel generator, rather than a car engine or petrol generator, were closest to a \ntypical urban pollutant mixture. A proportion of the output from the generator was mixed thoroughly \nwith the filtered air stream. Control of the amount of exhaust gases supplied to treatment domes was \n  6\nachieved through the use of an adjustable back-pressure valve (manually in 2000 and automatically, \nusing a guillotine valve, in 2001-2) to achieve target concentrations.  \nThe target NOx concentration in solardome chambers was set at 100 nl l-1, which is typical of \nbusy urban roadside monitoring sites such as London\u2019s Cromwell Road (Bower et al., 2007). The \nrelative concentrations of NO and NO2 were also set to replicate the characteristically high NO:NO2 \nratio of urban roadside sites with a target ratio of 1.5 - 2.0 (AQEG, 2004). Control solardomes \nreceived charcoal-filtered air \n \n2.2. Air quality measurements  \nNOx concentrations were determined using a Model 200A chemiluminescent NOx analyser \n(Advanced Pollution Instrumentation Inc., San Diego, USA). Particulate concentrations were \nmeasured using a 3-stage particle impactor (Dekati Ltd, Finland) which classified particles into three \nsize classes: > 10 \u03bcm, 10 - 2.5 \u03bcm and 2.5 \u2013 0.3 \u03bcm. The impaction substrates were coated with 4.0 \n\u03bcl of a saturated solution of Apiezon-L vacuum grease (Apiezon Products, UK) dissolved in toluene \nat 25oC. Particulate concentrations were determined gravimetrically  \nBenzene and toluene were used as indicator species for the range of VOCs produced by \ncombustion processes; these were measured using standard thermal desorption tubes (102 mm x 6 \nmm stainless steel, Supelco, USA). Tubes were packed with Chromosorb-106 and a known volume \nof air was drawn through them, using a low-volume pump (typically 100 ml min-1) for between 1 to 7 \ndays. Exposed tubes were thermally desorbed using a Perkin-Elmer ATD-400 Cold Trap (Perkin \nElmer, USA) and subsequently analysed by gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy (Hewlett \nPackard (now Agilent), Canada. Models 5890A series 2 and 5972 respectively). Specific ion \ndetection (m\/z 78 and 91 for benzene and toluene respectively) followed the method outlined in \n  7\nBinnie et al. (2002). Calibration was carried out using Supelco JMHW VOC mix in methanol, further \ndiluted in methanol. Reported values were blank corrected. \nMeasurements of HONO were carried out simultaneously in all four domes on 6 separate \noccasions, from 10 October 2001 to 27 June 2002. Air was sampled continuously over 2 weeks using \na low volume pump (flow rate 350 ml min-1) on to two tubular denuders in series, each coated with \nsodium carbonate. HONO was trapped on the K2CO3 coating of the denuder as a nitrite ion. \nFollowing extraction into water, the nitrite ion was measured spectrophotometrically using a \nmodified Griess-Saltzman procedure (Hargreaves, 1989). All samples were blank corrected. \nLevels of SO2 in both the pollution and control domes were checked during the summer of \n2000 and again in June 2001, using a UV fluorescence SO2 analyser (Model 4108, Dasibi, \nEnvironmental Corp., California, USA). Ad hoc measurements of ozone were also carried out at \ndifferent times of day and on days with a wide range of weather conditions, using a UV Photometric \nO3 analyser (Dasibi, Environmental Corp., California, USA).  \n \n2.3. Plant exposure experiments \nPlant exposure studies took place between 2000 and 2002, with the majority of the work focused in \nthe summers of 2000 and 2001. Species were selected to be both characteristic of the urban \nenvironment and representative of a range of plant functional types. A summary of the species used \nand their dates and duration of exposure is given in Table 1.  \n \n2.4. Plant propagation and cultivation \nSeeds of characteristic native herbaceous plant species were obtained from a number of research and \ncommercial seed suppliers (NERC Unit of Comparative Plant Ecology, Sheffield, UK; Kew Seed \nBank, London, UK; and Emorsgate Seeds, Norfolk, UK). Seeds were germinated in John Innes seed \n  8\ncompost and then single plants of each species were transplanted into 4 litre pots filled with John \nInnes No. 2 compost obtained from the local garden centre. Five replicate pots per species, each \ncontaining a single plant, were placed in each solardome. Plants were kept well watered using a \ncombination of automatic watering via an aerosol misting system and hand watering of containers. \nPlants were not fertilized during the experiments and any differences in soil conditions between pots \nwere assumed to be minimal. Potential between-treatment differences in soil conditions associated \nwith exhaust emissions were not measured. However, the existence of any such differences would be \nconsidered part of the plant-soil system response to fumigation, with associated impacts on plant \nperformance being recorded as part of the measurement protocol described below.  \n2.5. Plant measurements  \nDuring experiments, non-destructive measurements of plant growth, leaf senescence and flowering \nwere made by carrying out regular counts of the total numbers of live, dead and chlorotic leaves and, \nwhere applicable, flower buds, heads and seed heads, for each plant. However, not all parameters \nwere recorded in every year. The static contact angle of distilled water drops was measured on \nindividual detached leaves in 2000 and 2001, to determine the leaf surface wettability and provide an \nindication of the condition of epicuticular waxes (Cape, 1983). A 4 \u03bcl droplet of distilled water was \nplaced on the leaf surface, using a syringe, and a picture taken of the droplet within 30 seconds, using \na camera fitted with a macro lens. The resulting picture was scanned into a computer, magnified and \nthe angle between the water droplet and the leaf was measured using Adobe Photoshop 5.0 software.  \n \n2.6. Statistical analysis \nStatistical analysis was carried out using the R statistical package, Version 1.6.0 (CRAN, 2003). All \nthe data shown are based on the solardomes as the treatment replicate, with two replicates for both \nthe control and pollution treatments. Individual measurements from plants were treated as \n  9\npseudoreplicates since they were replicates of samples and not independent treatment replicates. For \nflowering, senescence and contact angle measurements, a nested ANOVA was carried out. The \ndesign was, therefore, 2 treatments x 2 replicate solardomes x 4-6 pseudo-replicate plants per species. \nThe time-series data from the regular leaf count and plant height measurements taken in 2001 \nwere analysed using derived variables analysis (Crawley, 2002). This method removes \npseudoreplication over time by reducing the repeated measures into a set of summary statistics \n(slopes, intersects and means). Regressions were carried out between day of fumigation and leaf \ncount for each dome and slopes and intercepts calculated. Where necessary, response variables were \ntransformed to obtain linear regressions. These derived variables were then investigated using two-\nway ANOVA. Following Sokal & Rohlf (1998), arcsine transformations were applied to all \nproportion data before analysis. Count data were transformed using square root or log (1+value), to \nmaintain zeros in the dataset whilst stabilising the variance (Crawley, 2002). Back-transformed \nmeans are presented in the results.  \n \n3. Results \n3.1. Pollutant concentrations \nFrom Figure 1 it can be seen that the fitting of the computer-operated control valve in early 2001 \nreduced fluctuations in average weekly NOx concentrations. \n  10\nTable \nConcentrations of particulate matter appear to have been fairly constant between 2001 and \n2002. The system change that took place in March 2002 caused changes in the level of a number of \npollutants, leading to an increase in VOC and HONO from 2001 to 2002. In addition, although there \nwas no\n2\nIn both 2001 and 2002, there were very few coarse particles in the polluted domes, with more \nthan 99% of the mass of particles measured having a diameter <2.5 \u03bcm. Alterations to the system in \nearly 2002 caused a large increase in the levels of toluene in the treatment domes and a smaller \nincrease in benzene concentrations. This led to a change in the benzene : toluene ratio, from 5.1 to \ne levels of VOCs measured in the control domes. SO2 \nconcentrations in the pollution and control domes were below 2 nl l-1, the limit of detection of the \ninstrument. Ad hoc measurements of O  showed levels in all four solardomes to be very similar, with \nconcentrations ranging from 5 to 15 nl l-1, averaging approximately 10 nl l-1. \n2 shows the approximate concentrations of different pollutants in the pollution treatment \nduring the main periods of the plant exposure experiments. In 2000, NOx concentrations were \napproximately 20% lower than the target 100 nl l-1. Target concentrations were, however, achieved in \n2001 and 2002. During 2000 and 2001 the NO:NO2 ratio was close to the lower end of the target \nrange of 1.5 \u2013 2.0; in 2002, the ratio rose to 2.2. \n \n overall change in NOx levels, there was an increase in the NO:NO2 ratio. This would have led \nto a fall in average NO  concentrations from 40 nl l-1 in 2001 to 30 nl l-1 in 2002. Changes to the \nsystem also led to a doubling of HONO concentrations in the polluted solardomes between the 2001 \nand 2002 main experimental periods. Measurements of HONO in the control treatment show good \nagreement between years. \n1.4. There was also a moderate increase in th\n3\n \n  11\n \n = 0.006;  S. oleraceus F1,2 = 23.38, p \n= 0.040\nR. acetosa, S. squalidus, P. annua, C. album and S. oleraceus.  \nResults from the derived variable analysis showed no significant treatment effect on leaf \ncount for S. squalidus, P. annua, C. album or S. oleraceus. However, there was a significant \ntreatment-related reduction in the slope of the regression between leaf count and length of fumigation \n(F1,2 = 340, p = <0.01) for C. nigra, indicating that pollutant exposure slowed down the production of \ntically significant, there was a greater number of leaves of R. acetosa \nPlant senescence was assessed by measuring the proportion of dead leaves, as a percentage of the \ntotal number of leaves per plant\/pot, over time. As both L. corniculatus and C. album drop dead \nleaves, this assessment was not possible for these species; the percentage of dead stems was, \n3.2. Plant height measurements (2001)\nFigure 2 shows the average plant height in the pollution and control domes for C. album and S. \noleraceus. Five weeks in to the experiment in 2001, plants of both species were smaller in the \npollution treatment than in the control (C. album F1,2 = 169.9, p\n). Over the course of the experiment this significant difference was lost. \n \n3.3. Leaf count measurements (2001) \nDuring 2001, regular measurements of leaf production were taken throughout the growing season. \nFigure 3 illustrates the effects of pollutant exposure on the pattern of leaf development for C. nigra, \nplant leaves. Although not statis\nin polluted domes, compared to controls (F1,2 = 8.51, p = 0.10). ANOVA carried out on \nmeasurements from individual time periods for C. nigra, showed that the treatment effect on leaf \nnumber was not significant until 11 (F1,2 = 23.35, p = 0.04) and 15 (F1,2 = 479.7, p = 0.002) weeks of \nfumigation. \n \n3.4. Senescence responses \n  12\nL. corniculatus.  Table 3 shows the percentage of dead leaves in the \nA number of species, particularly annuals, flowered during the experiment and it was therefore \npossible to make an assessment of the effects of pollution treatment on reproductive phenology. \nAlthou\nWhilst the difference was not quite statistically significant, 100% of plants in the control \ndomes were in flower after 5 weeks\u2019 fumigation, compared to only 33% in the polluted domes (F1,2 = \n16.0, p = 0.057). Measurements of the percentage of different flowering stages also support the \nhypothesis that pollutant exposure delayed flowering. After 7 weeks\u2019 fumigation, a greater proportion \nof the flowers in the pollution treatment were buds (P<0.059), whilst a greater proportion of those in \nthe con\nhere is also evidence of delayed flowering in other species. In 2001, five of the 24 C. nigra \nd flower buds by the September measurement period. Of these, \nonly one was in the pollution treatment. In 2002, after 9 weeks fumigation, P. annua plants in the \npollution domes had significantly less flower buds than control plants (F1,2 = 65.03, p = 0.015). \nhowever, used as a proxy for \ntreatment and control solardomes. For all species, there were more dead leaves on plants exposed to \nvehicle emissions, compared to controls.

Flowering responses \ngh measurements of first flowering dates were not made during these experiments, recorded \npatterns of flower development indicated that, for some species, plants exposed to vehicle emissions \nmay have had delayed flowering compared to control plants. This is illustrated by flower counts \nmade for S. oleraceus at four points during the summer of 2001 (Table 3). \ntrol were dead and about to set seed. Two weeks later, a significantly greater proportion of \nflowers on plants in polluted domes were as buds and open flowers compared to control plants \n(P=0.04), and a significantly smaller proportion had set seed (P=0.009). At the end of the experiment, \nafter 12 weeks\u2019 fumigation, the differences had narrowed and were no longer significant. \nT\nplants in the experiment had develope\n  13\n3.6.

This difference was only significant \nfor R. acetosa in 2000 (F1,2 = 498.3, p = 0.002); in 2001 this difference was not significant. The trend \nfor species with a contact angle greater than 90\u02da is less clear. Both increases and decreases were \n to pollutant exposure. Lotus corniculatus and S. oleraceus showed a decrease in \ncontact angle relative to the control, although this was only statistically significant for S. oleraceus \n1,2\n \n4.1.

Consideration is, therefore, given to non-significant results \nin order not to overlook potentially important trends, particularly where the percentage difference \nbetween treatments is high or the results support a general trend. Furthermore, whilst pollutant uptake \nmay have been altered during periods of plant watering, this was not measured and can be considered \nto reflect the variability in uptake associated with different atmospheric humidities and rainfall \nintensities in the natural environment. \nGrowth measurements suggest a small, species-specific stimulation or inhibition of growth in \nresponse to pollutant exposure. For some species, notably C. nigra, R. acetosa and P. annua, effects \n \nContact angle measurements were only carried out in 2000 and 2001 (Figure 4). For species with a \ncontact angle of less than 90\u02da, there was a general trend for either no treatment effect or for an \ninc ease in contact angle \nfound in response\n(F  = 51.64, p = 0.019). \n4. Discussion \nThe low level of solardome replication in this study, and associated low statistical power, is one of \nthe reasons why, despite the often large percentage differences between treatments, relatively few \nstatistically significant results were fou\n  14\n l-1 NO2 were \nreater for plants fumigated from seedling emergence than for plants that began fumigation as \npression of C. album and S. oleraceus \nseen in this study disappeared over time implies that, for much of the experiment, plants in the \npolluted domes must have had a higher relative growth rate than those in the controls.  \n \nmonstrated premature senescence for several species of potted plants following exposure to \nof pollutant exposure did not become apparent until approximately nine weeks after fumigation, and \nappeared to be cumulative over time. \n Interestingly, height data suggest that young plants are more sensitive to exhaust emissions than \nolder ones, with the strong negative growth effects shown by the annual species C. album and S. \noleraceus when they were seedlings, being lost as the plants matured. These results suggest that, for \nsome species, the biggest effects of the pollution treatment are associated with the early stages of the \nlife cycle. This theory is supported by work by Whitmore and Mansfield (1983) who found that, for \nP. pratense and Dactylis glomerata, the effects of overwinter fumigation with 66 nl\ng\nestablished seedlings. The fact that the strong initial growth sup\n4.2. Effects of pollutant exposure on plant phenology \nPremature leaf senescence was one of the most consistent responses across species. Several other \nstudies have also reported increased leaf senescence in response to air pollution. For example, Saxe \n(1994) de\nhigh levels of NOx. Lane & Bell (1984) also reported a significant increase in the dead leaf mass of L. \nperenne and Phleum pratense exposed to low levels of either NO2 or NO, while Viskari et al. (2000a) \nreported signs of accelerated cell senescence of Picea abies exposed to exhaust gases with 50-200 nl \nl-1 NOx.  \nHowever, it is important to note that other components of vehicle emissions may also be responsible \nfor the observed increase in senescence in the current study. The VOC ethylene, which is also a plant \nhormone, is known to increase the rate of senescence (Collins & Bell, 2002). It might be expected \n  15\nt some compensatory \nmechan\ner, the delay, rather \nthan acceleration, in flowering in polluted solardomes is in line with results from earlier NOx \nent of NOx, rather than VOCs in the current study. \nthat increased senescence in plants exposed to exhaust gases would lead eventually to lower growth \ndue to the reduced activity period of photsynthetically active tissue. However, this was not the case \nfor many of the species in these experiments, suggesting the possibility tha\nism, for example changes in photosynthetic rate, leaf surface area or root allocation, may \nhave occurred. Gratani et al. (2000) found that although the foliage of Quercus ilex trees had a \nreduced life span following exposure to high traffic levels in Rome, this was compensated for by \nhigher stomatal conductance, chlorophyll content and photosynthetic activity.  \nIn this experiment, there was evidence that exposure to exhaust gases delayed flowering in a \nnumber of species. This finding supports the results of Saxe (1994) and Law & Mansfield (1982), \nfollowing exposure to high concentrations of NOx. At more realistic NOx concentrations, Whitmore \n& Mansfield (1983) reported delayed development of flowering stems of P. pratense, although in \nthat study there was no overall effect on the final number of flowering heads produced. Elevated \nethylene concentrations have been suggested as the cause for accelerated flower development \nfollowing exposure of Petunia hybrida at different distances from a motorway (Pleijel et al., 1994). A \nsimilar acceleration of seed production in Lotus corniculatus has also been shown following \ncontrolled exposure to VOCs in open top chambers (Cape et al., 2003). Howev\nfumigation studies and thus suggests an involvem\nA change in the timing of flowering has the potential to alter synchronicity with insect pollinators \nand thus the reproductive success of affected plant species, particularly annuals. \n \n4.3. Leaf surface waxes \nA number of authors have reported changes in leaf surface characteristics in response to air pollutant \nexposure, although the majority of this work has concentrated on the needles of coniferous trees \n(Turunen & Huttunen, 1990). Changes in surface waxes are a very general sign of alterations in \n  16\nses, and this \ncould p\nes in their \nphysica\nt show \nimpact\n observed changes in contact angle in the current study are \nsymptomatic of the degradation of surface waxes, this may reflect an increase in non-stomatal water \nloss. This could have important implications for a plant\u2019s water relations, particularly under drought \nsurface properties, including chemistry or surface roughness (Holloway, 1970), and can result from a \nrange of natural and anthropogenic factors. Indeed, chamber environments themselves have been \nshown to affect leaf surface properties (Cape & Percy, 1993). Oxides of nitrogen can react directly \nwith the cuticle, but generally only after very long exposure to a large concentrations (Lendzian & \nKerstiens, 1991). Following foliar absorption, NOx may also disrupt metabolic proces\notentially affect leaf wax composition and structure indirectly, although little is known about \nthis possible mechanism (Cape, 1994). Chui et al. (1992) showed that the addition of fertiliser to \nDouglas fir trees (Pseudotsuga menziesii) increased cuticular waxes; at the whole plant level, NOx \ncan act as a fertiliser, thus having the potential to affect leaf surface structure indirectly. \nVOCs are very lipid soluble and may accumulate in leaf waxes, leading to chang\nl properties and structure (Riederer, 1994). Indirect effects on plant metabolism are rare. \nHowever, a number of small organic plant molecules such as ethane and ethylene can be stimulated \nby plant stress, including pollution-induced stress. This may provide a potential route for the indirect \neffect of pollutants that do not themselves react directly with surface waxes (Cape, 1994). \nThe probability of particulate matter causing direct effects on leaf surface waxes depends \nmainly on the chemical composition of the particles. There are a limited number of studies tha\ns, usually in the form of increased water loss, of inert dusts (Eveling, 1969; Farmer, 1993). \nHowever, where studies have reported surface wax degradation following exhaust gas exposure, this \nhas been attributed to organic hydrocarbons and NOx (Viskari et al., 2000a) or, more specifically, the \nlipophilic aromatic hydrocarbons associated with vehicle emissions (Sauter & Pambor, 1989). \nThe cuticle has a number of important functions including the prevention of excessive water \nloss, regulation of solute uptake, protection of sensitive underlying tissues and acting as a barrier to \npathogens (Percy et al., 1994). If the\n  17\nconditions, a situation which is predicted to occur with increasing frequency under UK scenarios for \nnge (IPCC, 2001).  \n \nThis study has demonstrated a variety of responses of a large number of herbaceous plant \nspecies to realistic levels of a cocktail of typical urban pollutants. The results indicate that plants \ngrowing in polluted urban environments are likely to experience significant changes in the timing of \nkey activities such as flowering and leaf senescence, as well as potentially detrimental changes in leaf \nsurface characteristics and growth. Species differed in the magnitude of response to pollutant \nexposure, although differences were not consistent within taxonomic or functional groups. Urban \nplant communities are already strongly affected by anthropogenic influences such as disturbance and \nthe urban heat island effect. Impacts on plant physiology, biochemistry, phenology and growth \ndemonstrated in this and several related studies imply that traffic-derived pollution is responsible for \n stress in urban environments, with important implications for plant \nperformance and the health and sustainability of urban ecosystems.  \nThis research was supported by a grant from the UK Natural Environment Research Council under \nthe URGENT thematic programme, with provision of a studentship to S.L.
