This debate is reflected in a number \nof edited volumes that seek to define the current state-of-the-art and \n(re)define the conceptual boundaries of economic geography (for example, \nsee Amin and Thrift, 2004; Clark et al, 2000; Lee and Wills, 1997; Sheppard \nand Barnes, 2000). During the 1970s and 1980s, in the wake of the critique of \nspatial science and views of the space-economy that drew heavily on the \northodoxies of neoclassical economics, strands of heterodox political-\neconomy approaches in general and Marxian political economy in particular \nrose to prominence. These were important in introducing concerns with issues \nof evolution, institutions and the state, alongside those of agency and \nstructure, in seeking to develop more powerful and nuanced understandings \nof economies and their geographies. Much of the subsequent debate in the \n1990s has been informed by post-structural critiques of the such political- \neconomy approaches, especially those that were seen (rightly or wrongly) to \nrely upon an overly-deterministic and structural reading of the economy and \nits geographies (Hudson, 2001). These have been important in seeking to re-\nthink relationships between categories such as consumption and production \nand to provoke more serious consideration of issues such as the relations \nbetween agency, practice and structure, the materiality of the economy and \nthe relations between people, nature and things, and of the discursive \nconstruction and representation of \u201cthe economy\u201d. \n \nBut perhaps the focal point of these critiques and debates revolves around the \nissues of culture and the economy, and the relationships between them, both \nontologically and epistemologically1. There is an as yet unresolved \u2013 and \nmaybe irresolvable \u2013 debate as to the character of the relationships between \nculture and economy, with important differences within as well as between the \nadvocates of culture\/cultural economy and those of economy\/political \neconomy. Recognising this, and so at the risk of some oversimplification, I \nwant to suggest that the recent debates in economic geography can be \nrepresented in terms of a dialogue between the proponents of political-\neconomy and those of cultural-economy (which I will elaborate below). \nHowever, rather than seeing these as competitive alternatives (which I think it \nis fair to say has been largely the case to date, and I will return briefly to the \nimplications of this in the final section of the paper), I want to argue that they \nare most appropriately seen as complementary perspectives from which we \n                                                 \n1 As one of the referees of the paper rightly pointed out, however, there are strands of the \neconomic geography literature that pre-figure this more general concern with relationships \nbetween the cultural and the economic (for example, from Buchanan (1935) to Harvey (1973, \n195-284) to Lee (1989)). I can only plead guilty to the charge of \u201chistorical shortsightedness\u201d \nthat (s)he levels at me. In my (partial) defence, I would argue that I am not alone in this regard \nas economic geographers have generally sought inspiration in links with other social science \ndisciplines rather than in the history of thought in their own sub-discipline (though see Barnes, \n2001) but will be happy on a future occasion to seek to correct this shortcoming.  \n 2\nFinal draft, 20\/10\/2003 \ncan seek to understand more fully and in more subtle and nuanced ways \neconomies and their geographies \n \nMy primary focus in this paper, then, is with exploring the possibilities for \ndeveloping more subtle and nuanced conceptualisations of economies and \ntheir geographies rather than with the practice of empirical research in \neconomic geography, although I will make a few remarks on the latter subject2 \nand clearly the two are co-dependent. I therefore begin with two introductory \nquestions and sets of issues. First, how do we best conceptualise the \nproduction of social life in general, in terms of relations between \nstructures\/practices\/agents and between people and things? Secondly, and \nmore specifically, how do we most appropriately conceptualise \u2018the economy\u2019 \nin capitalism, its temporalities and spatialities, its circuits and spaces and the \nlinks between them? By the \u2018economy\u2019 I refer to those processes and \npractices of production, distribution and consumption, which are \nsimultaneously discursive and material constructions through which people \nseek to create wealth, prosperity and well-being and so construct economies; \nto circuits of production, circulation, realisation, appropriation and distribution \nof value. Value is always culturally constituted and defined.  What counts as \n\u2018the economy\u2019 is, therefore, always cultural, constituted in places and \ndistributed over space, linked by flows of values, monies, things and people \nthat conjoin a diverse heterogeneity of people and things.  \n \nBy \u2018capitalism\u2019 I refer to a particular mode of political-economic organisation \ndefined by socially produced structural relations and parameters, which are \nalways \u2013 and necessarily - realised in culturally and time\/space specific forms. \nThe extent to which the contemporary phase of capitalism represents a break \nfrom past trajectories of capitalist development continues to be a matter for \ndebate. Although there is now more emphasis on continuity than on radical \nruptures between \u2013 say \u2013 Fordism and post-Fordism, or other dichotomous \nbinaries, there are still claims and counter-claims about the extent to which \nthe economy is characterised by greater \u2018flexibility\u2019 or has become more \n\u2018cultural\u2019. \n \nThe prime focus of this paper is the second introductory question, the \nconceptualisation of capitalist economies, but it is framed by the first. \nCapitalist economies are constituted via a complex mix of social relations, of \nunderstandings, representations and interpretations, and practices. Certainly \nthe class relations of capital are decisive in defining such societies as \ncapitalist but these are (re)produced in varying ways and in relation to non-\ncapitalist class relations and non-class social relationships of varying sorts \n(such as those of age, ethnicity, gender, and territory). The social \nrelationships of non-capitalist economies undoubtedly assume a great variety \nof forms, and occasional reference will be made to them. However, in order to \nallow some depth of analysis the focus will be on the economies of \ncapitalisms and the social relations of capital that define and dominate them.  \n                                                 \n2 The paucity of my remarks on the latter partly reflect limitations of space and certainly \nshould not be seen suggesting that empirical research is somehow seen as lees important. \nThe value of theory lies in capacity to inform and guide empirical research rather than theory \nbeing a substitute for it. \n 3\nFinal draft, 20\/10\/2003 \n \n2 Guiding principles: six axioms and some of their implications \n \nIn seeking to answer the two introductory questions, I begin from six axioms. \nFirst, there is a need for concepts at a variety of levels of abstraction. This \ntheoretical variety is necessary in order to describe and account for the \ndiverse individual and collective practices, with varying temporalities and \nspatialities, involved in processes of production, distribution, exchange and \nconsumption and in the spatio-temporal flows of materials, knowledge, people \nand value (variously defined) that constitute \u2018economies\u20193. All social life occurs \nin irreversible flows of time and has a necessary spatiality. Secondly, \nhowever, the \u2018economy\u2019 must be conceptualised in such a way that these \ndiverse practices are seen as necessarily inter-related and avoid fragmenting \nthe economy into dis-located categories such as production and consumption, \nseeing these as at best unrelated and at worst hermetically sealed and self-\ncontained.  For a considerable period of time much social scientific analysis of \nthe economy  - whatever its theoretical stripe  - tended to separate the \nanalysis of consumption from that of production4 and explicitly or implicitly \nprioritised production over consumption. Consumption was simply seen as a \nnecessary adjunct to production. Now this is the case in capitalist economies \nin one very precise sense. For both production and consumption \u2013 or, more \naccurately, exchange and sale \u2013 form moments in the totality of the \nproduction process and the point of sale is critical as this realises the surplus-\nvalue embodied in commodities and returns it to the monetary form. However, \nthis is only a partial perspective on consumption. While services of necessity \nare (co)produced and consumed in the same time\/space, the moment of sale \nof material commodities marks a shift in emphasis from their exchange to their \nuse value characteristics, to what can be done with them post-sale in a variety \nof spaces of private and public consumption in homes and civil society. For \nthe life of commodities after they have been sold has important instrumental, \nmaterial and symbolic connotations and dimensions (ranging from the \ncreation of waste, to the giving of gifts based on relations of family, friendship, \nlove and reciprocity, to the creation of identities). \n \nThirdly knowledgeable and skilled subjects, motivated via various rationalities, \nundertake all forms of economic behaviour and practices5. Although people \nare certainly not the all-knowing one-dimensional rational automatons of neo-\nclassical theory, what they do, how they do it, and where they do it, are the \noutcomes of purposeful behaviour, underpinned by knowledge and learning. \nPeople are not cultural dupes, not passive bearers of structures or habits, \nnorms and routines. Conversely flows of people in the course of their actions \n                                                 \n3 Gough (2003) takes me to task for not rigorously deducing such concepts from the value \ncategories of capital (see Hudson, 2001). But to do so would be to seek a single totalising \nmeta-narrative account that can explain anything and everything.   \n4 Economic geography was handicapped for some time by the legacies of 1960s spatial \nsciences approaches to location theory that sought to develop specific partial equilibrium \ntheorisations of the space economies of exchange, sale and production \u2013 consumption as \nsuch was simply ignored.  \n5 The significance of knowledge and learning in the contemporary economy has recently been \nemphasised (Giddens, 1990). However, the key issue is the new ways that knowledge is \nimportant economically, not that knowledge has suddenly become economically important. \n 4\nFinal draft, 20\/10\/2003 \nwithin the economy (and in other arenas, such as those of family and \ncommunity) can become a mechanism and medium for flows of knowledge. \nSuch flows can occur both in the form of embodied knowledge (often tacit) \nand that of the transmission of information in codified forms (written, spoken) \nvia a variety of media (letter, telephone, fax, e-mail, for example).  \n \nSeen from this perspective, the economy is performed and (re)produced via \nmeaningful and intentional human action but knowledge does not translate in \nany simple one-to-one relationship to behaviour. Knowledge is a necessary \nbut not sufficient condition. Action is much more than simply a product of \ninformation and knowledge, shaped by diverse influences, from emotion to \neconomic possibilities. Moreover, people and organisations have differential \nabilities to acquire and use knowledge in pursuit of their various projects \n(although this is not to equate such behaviour with generalised self-reflexivity \nand the continuous monitoring of individuals\u2019 life projects: see Giddens, 1991; \nLash and Friedman, 1992). What people come to know and do depends in \npart upon their positionality in terms of class, ethnicity, gender and other \ndimensions of social differentiation and identity and the powers and resources \navailable to them by virtue of their position within a given social structure, its \norganisations and institutions. \n \nFurthermore, intention does not translate in any simple one-to-one \nrelationship to outcome. Purposeful behaviour may have unavoidable and \nunintended as well as, or instead of, intended outcomes because people \nchronically act in circumstances in which they lack complete knowledge of the \ncontext, of other people and objects, and of the relationships between the \npeople and objects on which they act. Miller (2002, 166) draws attention to \n\u201cthe degree to which the political economy around us is the result of the \nunintended consequences of intentional actions\u201d. There may be emergent \nproperties because of the excess of practices, and the messy conjoining of \npeople and things in heterogeneous networks and processes of ordering that \nproduce emergence.  Consequently, it is necessary to take seriously the \nunintended consequences of human action, at all levels from the individual to \nthe formal organisations and institutions of the state (see Habermas, 1976; \nOffe, 1975). Complex change may be unrelated to agents actually seeking to \nproduce change. They may simply recurrently perform the same actions but \n\u201cthrough iteration over time they may generate unexpected, unpredictable and \nchaotic outcomes. Often the opposite of what human agents may be seeking \nto realise\u201d (Urry, 2000b, 4). Nevertheless, given these qualifications about \nuncertainty, ignorance, and unintended outcomes, a concept of an economy \nthat is not underpinned by intentional, purposeful behaviour, knowledge and \nlearning is simply, literally, inconceivable. Economic practices are performed \nby knowledgeable, socially constituted subjects, although the outcomes of \ntheir actions may differ from those intended. However, the ways and forms in \nwhich knowledge and learning influence economic practice can and do vary \nover space and time.  \n  \nThe fourth axiom follows from the third: the economy is socially constructed, \nsocially embedded, instituted in a Polyanian sense (with institutions ranging \nfrom the informality of habits to the formal institutions of government and the \n 5\nFinal draft, 20\/10\/2003 \nstate: for example, see Hodgson, 1988)6. These various institutions exhibit a \ndegree of stability over the medium-to-long term, set within the longue dure\u00e9 \nof structural parameters and necessary relationships that define a particular \nmode of political\u2013economic organisation (such as capitalism) As such, the \neconomy can be thought of as a relatively stable social system of production, \nexchange and consumption7. However institutional stability is always \nconditional and contingent, as there are processes that seek to disrupt and \nbreak out of established institutional forms as well as processes that seek to \nreproduce them. Hollingsworth  (2000, 624) emphasises that \u201c \u2026 there is a \ngreat deal of path dependency to the way that institutions evolve\u201d. \nConsequently institutional evolution is path dependent, as economic practices \nare performed in and create real, irreversible time. However, this is also a \nconditional dependence, for there are forces that seek to break path-\ndependency as well as those that reproduce it. Therefore it would be more \naccurate to describe economic and institutional development trajectories as \npath contingent, with periodic cyclical crises along a given path and the \npotential for secular changes from one path to another.  \n \nThe fifth axiom is that behaviour (individual and collective) is both \ninstitutionalised and enabled and constrained by structures, understood as \nstable yet temporary (albeit very long-term) settlements of social relationships \nin particular ways (see Figure 1). Structural relations specify the boundary \nconditions and parameters that define a particular mode of political economic \norganisation as that mode. For example, the class structural relation between \ncapital and labour is a defining feature of the capitalist mode of production \u2013 if \nthis was not present, then some other mode of production would exist. \nHowever, this relationship can be constituted in varying instituted forms  and \nthis is central to the possibilities of creating many capitalisms and their \nhistorical geographies. Whatever the specific form, however, economic agents \nbehave in instituted ways that are shaped by, and at the same time help \nreproduce, such structural relations. There is a definite relationship between \npractices in the short-term and in the long(er)-term. This is not to say that \nsuch relationships may not be challenged  - they often are. However, such \nchallenges are typically folded into and absorbed in ways that alter, but do not \nradically break and transform, the defining structural characteristics and \nboundary conditions defined by capitalist social relations. Nonetheless, there \nis theoretical space for structural change, a point of immense political \nsignificance.  \n \nThe sixth axiom follows from the previous two. \u2018The economy\u2019 is constructed \nvia social relations and practices that are not natural and typically are \ncompetitive. Consequently, they must be politically and socially (re)produced \n                                                 \n6 Institutional approaches are discussed more fully in section 5. \n7 Hollingsworth (2000, 614-5) suggests that a social system of production \u201cis the way that a \nsociety\u2019s institutions, its institutional arrangements and its institutional sectors are integrated \ninto a social configuration. A society\u2019s modes of economic governance and co-ordination and \nits institutional sectors develop according to a particular logic\u2026 institutions and institutional \narrangements within sectors are historically rooted\u201d. While a useful elaboration, this emphasis \non \u2018sectors\u2019 suggests only a partial grasp of the institutions and processes through which the \nsocial relations of capital are (re)produced. \n 6\nFinal draft, 20\/10\/2003 \nvia regulatory and governance institutions that ensure the more or less \nsmooth reproduction of economic life. These range from very informal \ngovernance institutions such as habits and routines in a variety of spheres, \nincluding those of civil society, community, family, and work, to the legal \nframeworks and formal regulatory mechanisms of the state. In short, there is a \nneed to ensure the reproduction of the social relations of capitalism and not \njust those of capital, while acknowledging that the latter are both defining and \ndominant in capitalist economies and societies. However, while dominant, \nthey are neither singular nor uncontested. Equally, there is a significant \ndifference between the existence of rules and behavioural conformity with \nthem. People may seek to break rather than obey rules, raising key questions \nas the circumstances in which they will do so (not least in terms of issues of \npredictability of behaviour). A distinction may be drawn between the formally \nregulated economy, the informal economy and the illegal economy (Figure 2). \nThe formal economy consists of legal activities governed and regulated within \nthe parameters of legislation. The informal economy consists of legal activities \nthat are regulated by customary mechanisms and practices that fall outside \nthe legal framework. Other activities are illegal but nonetheless form part of \nthe economy (the economy of criminality, of the Mafia for example). However, \nthe boundaries between formal, informal and illegal are fluid and vary over \ntime\/space. \n \nThe variety of institutions leads to complex spatialities of governance and \nregulation. These combine the diverse spaces and spatial scales (national, \nsupra-national and sub-national) of state organisations and institutions within \ncivil society. Systems of governance and regulation are now more multi-scalar \n(Brenner et al., 2003) but national states retain a critical role within them \n(Sassen, 2003; Weiss, 1997; Whitley, 1999). While generally concerned with \nregulating the conditions that make markets possible, state activity can extend \nto supplementing or replacing market mechanisms in resource allocation, for \nexample in the provision of welfare services or the production of key goods \nand materials. \u2018The economy\u2019 is chronically re-produced in situations of \ncontested understandings, interests and practices because of the construction \nof governance and regulatory mechanisms that keep such potential disputes \nwithin \u2018acceptable\u2019 and \u2018workable\u2019 limits. However, such mechanisms \nthemselves must be socially (re)produced, often via processes of conflict and \nstruggle \u2013 and do not simply emerge automatically to meet the functional \nneeds of capital. Thus the practices of government, governance and \ngovernmentality are of critical importance. Furthermore, within forms of \ncapitalism that encompass formal political democracies these mechanisms \nmust be generally regarded as acceptable and legitimate but in dictatorial \ncapitalisms they may be more violently enforced as a result of state power. \nOne way or another, however, modes of governance and regulation must be \nsufficiently held in place, or at least for a time.  \n \nThe requirement for a degree of admittedly contingent institutional \u2013 and even \nmore so \u2013 structural stability reflects the need for a degree of predictability in \nthe outcomes of economic practices and transactions.  Such stability is a \nnecessary condition for a required degree of predictability in performing the \neconomy. This requirement is complicated precisely because of the dynamic \n 7\nFinal draft, 20\/10\/2003 \ncharacter of the capitalist economy, the constant becoming of the economy. \nThe economy is not something that simply is but always something that is \nnecessarily in the processes of becoming (as, for example, companies \nconstantly strive to produce new things, in new ways). The capitalist economy \nis performative, a practical order that is constantly in action (Thrift, 1999). \nConsequently, economic actors \u2013 workers, banks, manufacturing companies \nand so on \u2013 require a degree of predictability in order that the transactions \nand practices of the economy can be performed with some certainty as to \noutcome over varying time horizons. Companies need to be confident that \ncustomers will pay their bills on time, workers that they will receive their \nwages regularly, and governments that tax revenues will arrive at the due \ndate. As such, there is an unavoidable tension between destabilising \nprocesses that would undermine predictability, stabilising processes that seek \nto assure it, and the necessarily dynamic character of capitalist production \nthat complicates processes of governance and regulation and the smooth \nreproduction of capitalist economies. .  \n \nIn summary, I assume an instituted and structurally situated economy \nproduced by knowledgeable people behaving purposefully in pursuit of \ndifferent, and often competitive, interests, which can be pursued with a \nsufficient degree of predictability of outcome, and which are contained within \n\u2018acceptable \u2013 or at least tolerable - limits via a range of governance and \nregulatory mechanisms. There is an unavoidable tension between processes \nof institutionalisation, that seek to create a degree of stability and \npredictability, and the emergent outcomes of practices that seek to disturb \nthis, either deliberately or inadvertently. I therefore also acknowledge that \nthere is no single totalising meta-narrative that can explain everything about \neconomies and their geographies but that nonetheless meta-narratives \nremain valuable \u2013 indeed are necessary \u2013 in seeking such explanations (cf. \nMassey, 1995, 303-304).   \n \nMore specifically, I argue that there are, broadly speaking, two analytic \nstrategies for understanding the economy and its geographies, with different \nbut complementary inflections. The first approach can be defined as  \n\u2018(political) economic\u2019, taking categories such as value, firms and markets as \ngiven, with these assumed to exist prior to their being observed and described \nfrom \u201con high\u201d and to using them in analysing the economy. However, \ndifferent types of economics conceptualise and represent these in different \nways and I draw on Marxian and other heterodox traditions. The second can \nbe thought of as \u2018cultural (economic)\u2019, with an epistemological focus on the \ndiscursive and practical construction and \u201cmaking-up\u201d of these categories, \nwhile rejecting ontological claims that the economy has become more cultural. \nIt emphasises the ways in which the \u2018economy\u2019 is discursively as well as \nmaterially constructed, practised and performed, exploring the ways in which \neconomic life is built up, made-up, and assembled, from a range of disparate \nbut always intensely cultural elements.  \n \n \n3 A caveat about consumption and production \n \n 8\nFinal draft, 20\/10\/2003 \nI want to enter a qualifications at this point and insist that any simple equation \nof production\/economic and consumption\/cultural, and of the primacy of the \nlatter over the former, or vice versa, must be firmly rejected.  While there is \nclearly a case for paying attention to consumption, there has been a tendency \nfor the pendulum to swing too far, replacing one-sided accounts that were \noverly productionist in their emphasis with equally one-sided consumptionist \naccounts (Gregson, 1995), which, moreover, often conflate consumption with \nexchange and sale. This was especially so with \u201cfirst wave\u201d consumption \nstudies. For example, Bauman (1992, 49) asserts that \u201cin present day society \nconsumer conduct (consumer freedom geared to the consumer market) \nmoves steadily into the position of, simultaneously, the cognitive and moral \nfocus of life, the integrative bond of society \u2026 in other words, it moves into the \nself-same position which in the past \u2013 during the \u2018modern\u2019 phase of capitalist \nsociety \u2013 was occupied by work\u201d. Baumann alludes here to the elision of \n(allegedly) post-productionist consumer society with post-modern society. \nEchoing this, Lash and Urry (1994, 296, emphasis in original) claim that \u201cthe \nconsumption of goods and services becomes the structural basis of western \nsocieties. And via the global media this [pleasure seeking] principal comes to \nbe extended world-wide\u201d.  \n \nThere are two kinds of lessons to be drawn from this, which are reflected in \n\u201csecond wave\u201d consumption studies. First, politically, it clearly exemplifies the \ndangers of confusing fashions in academic thought based on very class and \nsocially specific experiences of an affluent minority with substantive changes \nin the living conditions and lifestyles of a much broader spectrum of the \nworld\u2019s population. Even in the core territories of capitalism, at best only a \nfraction of the consumption activities of the vast majority of people could be \nsaid to be \u201cpleasure seeking\u201d. McRobbie (1997) criticises the political \ncomplacency of recent work on consumption that emphasises pleasure and \ndesire precisely because it marginalizes issues of poverty and social \nexclusions in its urge to reclaim the\u201d ordinary consumer\u201d as a skilled and \nknowledgeable actor. For ordinary mundane consumption was (and indeed \nstill is) neither hedonistic, nor materialistic nor individualistic but was above all \nthe form by which \u201ccapitalism was negated and through which labour brought \nits products back into the creation of humanity\u201d (Miller, 2002, 182).  For the \nvast majority of people living beyond the affluent core territories, hedonistic \nconsumption and pleasure seeking behaviour \u2013 let alone the attainment of \npleasure \u2013 is a distant pursuit of the affluent minority, occasionally glimpsed \non TV screens in a world characterised by perpetual hunger and malnutrition \nfor the impoverished majority.  \n \nSecondly, theoretically, it illustrates the dangers of divorcing a concern with \nconsumption from issues of production, both specifically in the context of \ncapitalist economies but also more generally8. Understanding capitalist \neconomies and their geographies requires a more nuanced and subtle stance \nin theorising relations between the moments of consumption and production \nwithin the totality of the economic process9. Equally in terms of epistemology, \n                                                 \n8 One of the strengths of the commodity chain approach is that is seeks to connect \nconsumption and production practices: see Smith et al, 2002.  \n9 If this smacks of meta-narrative, it is only one, not the only one, of relevance here.  \n 9\nFinal draft, 20\/10\/2003 \nthere is, for example, a long history of rich ethnographic accounts of life in the \nworkplace that seek to build an understanding of work and the social relations \nof the workplace in terms of the categories, understandings and practices of \nthose engaged in the process (for instance, see Beynon, 197310). Conversely, \nthere are powerful political economies of consumption (for example, see Fine \nand Leopold, 1993; Miller, 1987). My argument is that such approaches are \nequally valid and should be seen as complementary. We need both to grasp \nthe complexity of capitalist economies and their historical geographies, \nexamining diverse practices of production, exchange and consumption from \nboth political economy and cultural economy perspectives.   \n \n \n4 Cultural economy approaches to understanding the economy \n \nThere has recently been a considerable resurgence of emphasis on \u2018cultural\u2019 \napproaches to understanding economies and their geographies, although \nthese are far from uniform, broadly falling into ontological and epistemological \nconcepts of a \u201ccultural economy (Ray and Sayer, 1999). For example, Lash \nand Urry (1994) argue that there has recently been a significant \n\u201cculturalisation\u201d of economic life, which is expressed in three ways. First, there \nhas been a growth in the numbers of innovative companies producing cultural \nhardware and software. Secondly, \u201cthere is a growing aestheticization or \n\u2018fashioning\u2019 of seemingly banal products whereby these are marketed to \nconsumers in terms of particular clusters of meanings, often linked to \nlifestyles\u201d (p. 7). Thirdly, that there has been a growing \u201cturn to culture\u201d in the \nworlds of business and organisations, precisely because maintaining or \nenhancing competitiveness requires companies in which they conduct \nbusiness and people to change the ways in which they behave within   \norganisations.  \n \nHowever, the significance and validity of these epochal claims of \u2018increased \nculturalisation\u2019 are far from assured. In certain limited respects the economy \nmay have become more cultural but to claim that the economy overall has \nbecome \u2018more cultural\u2019 is more problematic. The evidence in support of \u201cthe \nexemplary oppositions between a more \u2018use\u2019-value centred past and a more \n\u2018sign-value-centred present\u201d is simply \u201cempirically insubstantial\u201d (du Gay and \nPryke, 2002, 7). Typically it is fragmentary, at times simply anecdotal. \nHowever, there is also an issue of adequate theorisation and \nconceptualisation of the links between \u2019economic\u2019 and \u2018cultural\u2019. For, in \npractice, social actors cannot actually define a market or a competitor, \u201cexcept \nthrough extensive forms of cultural knowledge\u201d (Slater, 2002, 59, emphasis \nadded). Producers cannot know what market they are in without extensive \ncultural calculation; and they cannot understand the cultural form of their \nproduct and its use outside of a context of market competition. Understanding \nculture and (local) cultural difference is vital in order successfully to produce \nand sell globally (Franklin et al, 2000, 146). In like fashion, the economic \npractices of advertising, evocatively described as the \u201cmagic system\u201d \n                                                 \n10 Though Beynon\u2019s work is cast more in the mould of political economy and economic \nsociology than cultural analysis.  \n 10\nFinal draft, 20\/10\/2003 \n(Williams, 1959), are intrinsically caught up with the cultural understanding of \nthe role, functions and nature of advertisements  (McFall, 2002, 161).  \n \nThis draws attention to the way in which (to adopt a famous phrase from the \ncultural analysis of resources: Zimmerman, 1951): \u201cproducts and markets are \nnot, they become\u201d. This is perhaps most sharply emphasised by the iconic \ncommodity of twentieth century capitalism \u2013 the automobile \u2013 in which the \ncultural and economic are inextricably fused via the market segmentation and \nthe symbolic meanings associated with automobiles and automobility (Sheller \nand Urry, 2000). Furthermore, in order to be(come) a particular kind of \neconomic institution, a market must also be a certain kind of culturally defined \ndomain, because it depends on the social categorisation of things as \n(dis)similar (Slater, 2002, 68)11. The dependence of markets upon such social \ncategorisation undermines propositions about the increasing \u201cculturalisation of \nthe economy\u201d and the increasing, even complete, separation of the material \nand sign values of commodities.  \n \nCulturalism in its various forms reduces the product to its sign value and \nsemiotic processes. As a result, the object becomes entirely dematerialised \nas a symbolic entity or sign, infinitely malleable and hence never stabilised as \na socio-historical object; its definition can be entirely accounted for in terms of \nthe manipulations of codes by skilled cultural actors. As such, the materiality \nof the object and the material economy and social structures through which it \nis elaborated as a meaningful entity are ignored. Consequently, there is also a \ntendency to reduce market structures and relations to semiotic ones. It is \nrather difficult to imagine how markets could exist over time, as they patently \ndo, if products actually underwent the kind of semiotic reduction that \nculturalists assume. As Slater (2002, 73,) notes, \u201cmarkets are in fact routinely \ninstitutionalised, and are even stabilised, around enduring definitions of \nproducts, whereas the semiotic reduction would assume that \u2013 as sign value \u2013 \ngoods will be redefined at will\u201d.  \n \nHowever, while the definition of a commodity, or of a thing, cannot be \nresolved by drifting off into the realm of floating signifiers, neither can its \ndefinition be simply and solidly anchored in given material properties.  In \ncontrast, the meanings of things, and things themselves, are stabilised or de-\nstabilised, negotiated or contested, within complex asymmetrical power \nrelations and resource inequalities. This emphasises three things. First, the \nprocesses and interplay between the realms of the material, the symbolic and \nthe social through which the meanings of commodities are created, fixed and \nre-worked. Secondly, the instituted social field within which multiple actors \nseek to intervene to establish the meaning of things. Thirdly, the political-\neconomic structural relations within which both actors and social fields are \nlocated  - although these can get lost in the emphasis on meanings.  \n \nMoreover, Law (2002) argues that culture is located and performed in human \nand non-human material practices, which extend beyond human beings, \nsubjects and their meanings, and implicate technical, architectural, \n                                                 \n11 There are parallels here to the definition of an economic sector.  \n 11\nFinal draft, 20\/10\/2003 \ngeographical and corporeal arrangements12. As such, social production \nsystems comprise a heterogeneity of people and things and links among and \nbetween them. That the social has an irreducible materiality is \u2013 or ought to \nbe \u2013 old news: \u201cPerhaps Marx told us this. Certainly Michel Foucault and a \nseries of feminist and non-feminist partial successors have done so\u201d (Law, \n2002, 24) 13. The reference to Marx is important, since one strand of the \nMarxian view of production centres on the labour process and transformation \nof elements of nature by people using artefacts and tools. In this regard, Law \ndoes no more \u2013 nor less - than re-state a proposition from Marxian analysis \nthat conceptualises the economy as always a product of interactions between \nheterogeneous networks of people, nature (both animate subjects and \ninanimate objects) and things; of relationships between the social and the \nnatural.  \n \nThe conceptualisation of the economy therefore remains contested terrain, a \nterrain that is now more complex and in some ways more slippery in its \nanalysis of relationships than it used to be. This raises some important issues \nabout the relationships between \u2018culture\u2019 and \u2018economy\u2019. Miller (2002, 172-3) \nargues that it seems \u201cquite absurd\u201d to suggest that we live within some new \nself-conscious, self-reflexive economy. There are undoubtedly powerful \nmarketing discourses in the contemporary economy, but \u201cadvertising and \nHollywood were extraordinarily important\u201d in the USA of half a century ago, \nand these made as much use as they could of the current psychological \ntheories about how to create subjects (Williams, 1959). On the other hand, the \neconomy was just as cultural \u201cat the time when most academics saw \nthemselves as Marxists\u201d. It is undeniably true that a small, affluent minority \nlive more self-reflexive (self-centred) lifestyles. It is also certainly an \nexaggeration to claim that there was a time when  \u201cmost\u201d academics were \nMarxists. Neither point, however, negates the force of Miller\u2019s argument about \nthe limitations of claims about the culturalisation of the economy.  \n \nIn summary, positing a binary opposition between \u2018economy\u2019 and \u2018culture\u2019 is \nsimply implausible and unhelpful. There is, however, considerable merit in an \nepistemological conception of cultural economy that envisages the \u2018cultural\u2019 \nas a \u2018bottom up\u2019 method of analysis14, complementary to a more top-down \npolitical economy.  In contrast, suggestions that somehow the \u2018economy\u2019 has \n(ontologically) become more \u2018cultural\u2019 are misconceived and deeply \nproblematic. Miller (2002, 172-3) is particularly scathing in his comments \nabout the \u201cculturalisation of the economy\u201d thesis. He suggests that there \n                                                 \n12 The economy conceptualised as a heterogeneous networked association of people and \nthings is a more general characteristic of Actant-Network Theorists such as Law and Latour \n(1987).  \n13 Thus capitalist production is always more than just the production of commodities by means \nof commodities (as neo-Ricardians such as Sraffa, 1960, argue). Furthermore classical \npolitical economy embraced relations between economy and environment as well as \nrecognising the cultural constitution of \u2018the economy\u2019, as noted above.  \n14 Methodologically, this involves ethnographic and participant-observation approaches as \nwell as interview-based approaches. However, in several respects such approaches are not \nnew. Hermeneutic\/interpretative and ethnographic approaches have a long history, both \ngenerally in the social sciences and specifically in seeking to understand economic forms and \npractices (albeit not in the framework of cultural economy: for example, see Beynon, 1973).  \n 12\nFinal draft, 20\/10\/2003 \nseems to be \u201ca sleight of hand\u201d through which a shift in academic emphasis is \nsupposed to reflect a shift in the world, an economy that is more cultural than \nin earlier times15. In this, he echoes Hall (1991, 20), who cogently argues that \n\u201cwe suffer increasingly from a process of historical amnesia in which we think \njust because we are thinking about an idea it has only just started\u201d. It is \nimportant to avoid such amnesia and to avoid conflating changes in the \neconomy and changes in academic fashion. There is a need for eternal \nvigilance to guard against the constant danger of confusing new movements \nwithin thought (the (allegedly) new understanding that culture and economy \ncannot be theorised separately) from new empirical developments.  The \nhistory of classical political economy (as evidenced, for example in the \nwritings of Smith and Marx) prior to the marginalist revolution and the rise of \nneoclassical economics and its claims to universal economic laws was one \nthat recognised the cultural constitution of \u2018the economy\u2019 (see Amin and Thrift, \n2003). For \u201cculture is everywhere and little has changed in this respect \u2026 \neconomically relevant activity has always been cultural\u201d (Law, 2002, 21). \u201cIs it \nthe case\u201d, Slater (2002, 78) asks rhetorically, \u201cthat culture is more central to \nthe economic process than it was before? \u2026 the answer, I think, is only in \nparticular circumstances and instance but, in general, \u2018no\u2019\u201d. Seeking to \nrecover the ground conceded by the rise of neoclassicism in economics and \nacknowledge the long history of a cultural dimension within political economy \nis a very different matter to assuming that there has been a qualitative change \ninvolving the \u2018culturalisation\u2019 of the economy \u2013 the hard realities (if not quite \niron laws) of commodity production and the production of surplus-value \nremain.  \n \n \n5 Political-economic approaches to understanding the economy  \n \nAs with culture, the economic is a contested concept. There are several \nversions of \u2018the economic\u2019, based on differing theoretical presuppositions and \nforms and levels of abstraction (including neo-classical and mainstream \northodoxies, heterodoxies of various sorts including Marxian political economy \nand evolutionary and \u201cold\u201d and \u201cradical\u201d institutional approaches16). I reject the \ntechnicist conceptions of the economy and its geographies exemplified by \nneo-classical and mainstream orthodox economics, which persistently seek \nmethodologically to fix economic categories as self-evident or natural (and \nwhich are central to the (allegedly) new \u2018geographical economics\u2019: for \nexample see Krugman, 2000; Glaeser, 2000)17. Indeed, Slater (2002, 72) \n                                                 \n15 Law (2002) makes the same point about relationships between change in the world that \nsocial scientists analyse and changes in style and fashion of analysis that they deploy.   \n16 The distinction between \u201cradical\u201d, \u201cold\u201d and \u201cnew\u201d institutional analysis is important. \u201dNew\u201d \ninstitutionalism is close to the mainstream orthodoxies (Williamson, 1975).  \u201cOld\u201d \ninstitutionalism emphasises the institutional and social embeddedness of \u201cthe economy\u201d (as \nexpressed in the work of Common, Polyani, or Veblen: see Hodgson, 1994). Radical \ninstitutionalism emphasises issues such asymmetrical power relations in shaping economic \nlife (Dugger, 1989; 2000).   \n17 Thrift (1999, 59) notes the irrelevance of most formal economic \u2013 that is mainstream \northodox \u2013 theory to business practices. Indeed, these seem more in tune \u2013 albeit only \nimplicitly - with heterodox theories which emphasise the need to extract surplus-value from \nworkers, to ensure the creation of monopoly rents via product and organisational innovation, \n 13\nFinal draft, 20\/10\/2003 \nargues more generally that within economic analysis \u201cneeds and goods \nappear as a natural and self-evident\u201d. In more critical theory, the use \nvalue\/exchange value distinction within the commodity form \u201chas generally \nfunctioned as a proxy for the distinction for a \u2018natural metabolism\u2019 between \nman and nature, and the warped social form taken by need and things within \ncapitalist market relations\u201d.  While Slater\u2019s comments regarding neo-classical \nand mainstream orthodoxies are reasonable, his view of critical theory reveals \na partial and warped understanding of Marxian political economy. For \u2018critical\u2019 \nheterodox positions embrace more than Marxism while the notion of some \n\u2018unwarped\u2019 natural form is difficult to reconcile with any notion of \u2018the \neconomy\u2019 as socially constituted and embedded.  \n \nRecognising the heterogeneity of heterodox economics, I argue that a political \neconomy approach needs to combine the differing but complementary levels \nof abstraction of various heterodox positions \u2013 Marxian, institutional and \nevolutionary. This multiple approach is needed in order to begin to grasp the \ncomplexity of \u2018the economy\u2019 as constituted by labour processes, process of \nmaterial transformation and processes of value creation and flow in specific \ntime\/space contexts18. Marxian analyses allow a specification of the structural \nfeatures common to all capitalist economies that define them as capitalist. \nHowever, such structures do not exist independently of human practice; quite \nthe contrary. They are both a condition for and an expression and a result of \nsuch practices and are always contingently reproduced. Practices may give \nrise to emergent effects that challenge the reproduction of these structures, \nalthough there are powerful social forces and institutions that seek to assure \ntheir continuation. In short, there is a permanent tension between processes \nthat seek to destabilise these structural relations and those that seek to \nreproduce them, that is generally \u2013 but not inevitably \u2013 resolved in favour of \nthe latter. This may involve folding disruptive processes into new institutional \nforms of capitalism while leaving the defining class structural relations \nunchanged. \n \nIndeed, the distinction within Marxian political economy between modes of \nproduction and social formations, recognises that capitalism was \u2013 and is \u2013 \nconstituted in variable ways. This insight has been considerably developed \nwithin other strands of heterodox political economy, in particular within \nevolutionary and institutional economics and sociology.  Institutional \napproaches emphasise the ways in which these economies are constituted \nand embedded in specific cultural and time\/space contexts. Evolutionary \napproaches foreground the path dependent character of development. At its \nmost abstract level, the \u2018economy\u2019 in capitalism is certainly dominated, indeed \ndefined, by the social relations of capital \u2013 and powerful analytic tools are \nneeded to theorise these. At this level, Marxian political economy and its \n                                                                                                                                            \nand so on. Equally many trades\u2019 union practices have been shaped more by Marxian political \neconomy than by mainstream orthodoxies. Much public sector economic policy is guided by \nmainstream theoretical orthodoxies, which helps account for the chronic disjunction between \npolicy intentions and outcomes, although there is an increasing influence of various heterodox \nstrands of thought of local and regional economic development policy.  \n18 In turn, methodologically, it requires a variety of forms of evidence (quantitative and \nqualitative) relating to concepts such as firms, markets, or labour productivity.   \n 14\nFinal draft, 20\/10\/2003 \nvalue-theoretic account of the social relations and structures of capital \nprovides powerful conceptual tools to understand accumulation by, through \nand as commodity production and surplus\u2013value production. However, this is \na highly abstract approach and so there it is necessary to develop less (or \ndifferently) abstract concepts to understand how capitalist production and the \n(re)production of capital are secured. This requires other theoretical \nconstructs to capture the ways in which capitalism is instituted in specific \ntime\/space contexts, discursively and materially formed and concretised in \nand through specific informal and formal institutions. As such, it necessarily \nincludes theorising the state, regulation and governance within capitalism and \nalso links between the formal and informal sectors of capitalist economies19. \nPut another way, it requires understanding how practices, institutions and \nstructures inter-relate in the reproduction of capital (understood as a social \nrelationship). \n \nThis in turn, however, requires acknowledging that the commodity form within \ncapitalism is a slippery one, temporally and spatially (Appadurai, 1986), and \nthat the social structural relations of capital intersect with those of other social \nstructures (such as ethnicity or gender) in varying ways. While there may be \nco-evolution of structures, this is a variable and contingent process. Massey \n(1995, 303-4) recognises that there are broad social structural relations - of \nclass, gender and ethnicity, for example - which have determinate though non-\ndeterministic effects. Recognition of such broad structures \u201cis not the same as \nthe commitment to, or the adoption of, a metanarrative view of history. None of \nthe structures \u2026need to be assumed to have any inexorability in their unfolding \n\u2026 outcomes are always uncertain, history and geography have to be made\u201d. \nThese effects are determinate rather than deterministic precisely because of the \nmultiplicity of structures, the conjunctural specificities of which combination of \nstructures intersect and interact in a given time\/space (which may also activate \nspecific \u2018local\u2019 contingencies)20, and the emergent properties of practices.  \n \nThe process of commodification brings about, albeit unevenly, the extension \nand penetration of capitalist mechanisms and forms into aspects of the world \nand life-world from which they were previously absent. However, these \nprocesses result in uncertainty about the fate of commodities once they have \nbeen sold. The purchase of commodities depends (inter alia) upon the \nmeanings that consumers attach to them. Consumption is one source of \nmeaning and identity, both for those purchasing the commodity and those \nconsuming it (for example, the recipient of a gift). There are claims that we are \nwhat we eat, what we wear and so on and, beyond those, that the body itself \nhas become an accumulation strategy, with bodies worked on in terms of \nphysical fitness, health clubs and plastic surgery to reshape various parts of \nhuman anatomies in socially sanctioned ways.  Goods acquire meaning and \nvalue, becoming \u201cculturally drenched\u201d and so taking on \u201cidentity values\u201d, \nexpressed in rituals around possession and the giving of gifts, for example \n                                                 \n19 For comparable arguments, see McFall (2002) \n20 Miller (2002, 166) likewise emphasises the degree to which the political economy around us \nis the result of \u201cstructural conjunctions\u201d, as different structures interact in specific time\/space \nconjunctures.  \n \n 15\nFinal draft, 20\/10\/2003 \n(Featherstone, 1991). However, such identity values are subject to change \nand re-negotiation. Not least this is because commodities are manufactured \nwith their own pre-planned trajectories, with built-in obsolescence within a \nproduct life cycle.  As commodities reach the end of their socially useful lives \nto their original purchasers, they may be \u2018sold on\u2019, both formally and informally \nin a variety of spaces (such as street markets and car boot sales). In this \nprocess, the meanings attached to commodities by their original purchasers \nare typically re-worked (as, often, are the things themselves) so that there are \nrecursive circuits of things and meanings rather than simply a linear paths or a \nsingle circuit of meaning.  \n \nHowever, commodity production and consumption are also often complex \nprocesses of material transformations. The resultant \u2018environmental footprint\u2019 \nof these activities emphasises the critical grounding of \u2018economies\u2019 in nature. \nElements of \u2018first nature\u2019 become increasingly commodified while a \u2018second \nnature\u2019 is also increasingly produced from within the social relations of capital. \nThere is a significant difference between the appropriation of an \u2018external\u2019 first \nnature into capitalist social relations and producing a second nature within \nthose relations. With recent developments in biotechnologies even life itself \nhas become capitalised and produced as part of second nature (Franklin et al, \n2000). \n \nFinally, notwithstanding the increasing production of nature as second nature, \nwithin capitalist economies there remain \u2018economic activities\u2019 that are not \nunder the direct sway of capitalist relations of production, both within and \noutside the spaces of capitalism (Figure 2). This raises questions as to how \ncapitalist and non-capitalist economies relate to one another and about \nstrategies of \u2018accumulation by dispossession\u2019 \u2013 that is, (forcibly) taking \nthings\/people not produced as commodities and commodifying them (Harvey, \n2002,) 21. Not least, the key requirement of any form of capitalist production \u2013 \nthe availability of labour-power \u2013 requires that people produced in a non-\ncommodity form become commodified as labour-power, selling their capacity \nto work on the labour market in exchange for a wage. This requires \nunderstanding of the processes whereby people are reproduced as sentient, \nthinking human beings, conscious agents with their own agendas pathways \nand plans \u2013 that is, not as commodities \u2013 and the circumstances in which and \nthe processes through which they become commodified as labour-power22. \n \nThe key point in terms of conceptualising \u2018the economy\u2019, however, is that \nrecognising the existence of non-capitalist social relations within capitalist \neconomies and non-capitalist economies alongside capitalist ones requires \nconsidering different concepts and theories of value and other economic \ncategories to those appropriate to the mainstream, formal capitalist economy. \nIt requires consideration of different processes of valuation, in which value is \nnot defined as socially\u2013necessary labour time but in terms of some other \nmetric, perhaps in a more multi-dimensional way that reflects a broader range \n                                                 \n21 Historically, within radical political economy this was reflected in literatures on the \narticulation of modes of production (for example see Amin, 1977). \n22 There are circumstances in which slavery and indentured labour become mechanisms to \nassure the supply of labour-power outside the normal sphere of market transactions.  \n 16\nFinal draft, 20\/10\/2003 \nof cultural and social concerns23. This raises the issue of how best to \nunderstand processes of production and consumption in these \u2018alternative\u2019 \neconomies and their circuits, flows and spaces, both in themselves and in \ntheir (lack of) relationships to the mainstream24. This raises questions of \npolitical character of political economy and leads into a normative question of \nfuture alternatives, of \u2018sustainable economies\u2019 and their spaces. \n \n \n6 Cultural economy and political economy: complementary not \nalternative approaches \n \nWhile some see cultural economy as an alternative to political economy \napproaches, I prefer to see them as complementary perspectives: \nunderstanding geographies of economies necessarily needs to embrace both. \nThis does no more than recover a position that was central to classical \npolitical economy but that was generally  (there were exceptions) denied for \nmany decades following the ascendancy of neoclassical orthodoxy (and that \ncontinues to be denied within the discipline of mainstream economics). \nNonetheless, such recovery is vital to a more nuanced understanding of \neconomies and their geographies.  Thus the objects of analysis can be both \ntaken \u2018as given\u2019 and can be problematised in terms of their discursive and \nmaterial constitution. For example, consider the central concept of \u201cmarket\u201d. A \nmarket \u201cis physically a place, a set of socio-technologies, and a set of \npractices. \u2026  Socially it is also a set of rules\u201d (Law, 2002, 24).  In contrast, du \nGay and Pryke (2002, 2) suggest that \u201cthe turn to culture\u201d reversed the \nperception that markets exists prior to and hence independently of \ndescriptions of them. A cultural approach indicates the ways in which objects \nare constituted through the discourses used to describe and to act upon them. \nAs such, economic discourses format and frame markets and economic and \norganisational relations, \u201c\u2019making them up\u2019 rather than simply observing and \ndescribing them from a God\u2019s-eye vantage point\u201d. This has critical analytical \nimplications since it suggests that \u201ceconomic discourse is a form of \nrepresentational and technological (that is, cultural) practice that constitutes \nthe spaces within which economic action is formatted and framed\u201d. Put slightly \ndifferently, the discursive space of the economic decisively shapes the \npractical spaces of the economy; and vice versa.  Discursive and practical \nspaces are co-determining, co-evolutionary.  \n \nAs such, economic categories (for instance firms, or markets) need to be \nanalysed in complementary ways that acknowledge the processes through \nwhich commodities are produced and the meanings of commodities created, \nfixed and re-worked and the political-economic structural relations in which \npeople are unavoidably located. What is required is a culturally sensitive \npolitical economy that begins from the assumption that the economy is  - \n                                                 \n23 There is a connection here between concepts of space (defined in terms of capital\u2019s one-\ndimensional interest in locations as a source of profit) and place (reflecting people\u2019s multi-\ndimensional attachments to a location via relations of family, friendship and community): see \nHudson, 2001, Chapter 8. \n24 For example conceptualising the relationship between the mainstream formal economy and \nthe social economy or \u2018Third Sector\u2019 is discussed in Amin et al (2002). \n 17\nFinal draft, 20\/10\/2003 \nnecessarily \u2013 always cultural and a politically sensitive cultural economy that \nis alert to the power geometries and dynamics of political economy. These \nprovide complementary approaches, viewing the economy from different \nanalytic windows rather than an \u2018either\/or\u2019 ontological and epistemological \nchoice. Indeed these approaches in some respects interpellate one another \nrather than being discrete and self-contained. As such, the space currently \noccupied by culture-economy divisions and reductions could be at least \npartially reconstructed by treating concepts such as competition, markets, \nproducts and firms as both lived realities and as formal categories (cf. Slater, \n2002, 76). Indeed, it could reasonably be argued that Marxian political \neconomy has always contained strands of both approaches (Anderson, 1984). \n \n \n7 Re-considering the issues \n \nGiven the above, I now want further to explore in a preliminary way two sets \nof inter-related issues. First, the conceptualisation of relations between \nagents, practices, representations and structures and their varying \ntemporalities (Figure 1), using the notion of practice as what people do in the \neconomy as a way of better grasping relationships between agency and \nstructure by emphasising doing rather than just thinking, the material and \naffective as well as the cognitive25. Law (2002, 21-3) defines practices as \n\u201cmaterially heterogeneous relations\u201d that \u201ccarry out and enact complex \ninterferences between orders or discourses\u201d. As such, economic practices in \ntheir various and multiple specificities interfere in different and specific \nperformances with other, alternative strategies and styles. Moreover this \ninterference and multiplicity produce an \u201cirreducible excess\u201d, which is \nnecessary to the survival of discourses and performances grounded in them. \nSecondly, there is the issue of the conceptualisation of relations between \nspaces, flows and circuits, addressing the question of how to explain which \nparts of circuits are \u2018fixed\u2019 in which spaces for a given period of time. Three \npoints can be made briefly in relation to this second question. First, spaces \nmust be understood relationally, as socially constructed. Secondly, economic \nprocess must be conceptualised in terms of a complex circuitry with a \nmultiplicity of linkages and feedback loops rather than just \u2018simple\u2019 circuits or, \neven worse, linear flows26 (though for convenience the terminology of \u2018circuits\u2019 \nis used below: see Jackson, 2002, for a similar argument) 27. Thirdly, the \neconomy must be conceptualised as a complex system, a fortiori given \nrecognition that it involves material transformations and co-evolution between \nnatural and social systems.  \n \nThere are two important implications of \u2018complexity\u2019 in this context. First, \neconomic practices may have unintended as well as, or instead of, intended \nconsequences, because people chronically act in circumstances of partial \n                                                 \n25 Deploying practice in this way may well be anathema to non-representational theorists.  \n26 Such as commodity chains (Gereffi and Korzeniewicz, 1994) or production seen as a linear \nseries of materials transformations (Jackson, 1996). \n27 \u201cMy argument involves a move from linear commodity chains to more complex circuits and \nnetworks as a way of subverting dualistic thinking and unsettling the kind of linear logic that \nsees consumption at one end of a chain that begins with consumption\u201d (Jackson, 2002, 5). \n 18\nFinal draft, 20\/10\/2003 \nknowledge. Secondly, \u2018complexity; implies emergent properties that may lead \nto a change between developmental trajectories rather than simply path \ndependent development along an existing trajectory. There is a danger that \nconcepts of path dependency (especially if grounded in biological analogy) \ncan lead to an underestimation of the role of agency and reduce actors to \n\u201ccultural dupes\u201d (Jessop, 2001). People thus cease to be knowledgeable \nactors and come to be regarded as the passive bearers of habits, norms and \nroutines (much as structuralist readings of Marx reduced them to passive \nbearers of structures). As a result, the concept of path contingency better \nexpresses the possibilities of moving between as well as along developmental \npaths (Hardy, 2002). Actions and practices and systemic interactions may \ncreate emergent properties that alter, incrementally or radically, the direction \nof developmental trajectories. Consequently, evolutionary paths may be far \nfrom straightforward. As such, recognition of complexity and emergent \nproperties can aid understanding of a shift from a simple evolutionary \nperspective of change along a given trajectory to evolution understood as a \nchange from one trajectory to another28.   \n \nThere has been a lively - at times, heated \u2013 debate as to the \nconceptualisation of contemporary economy and society in terms of circuits, \nflows or spaces, and of the relations between them. Some argue that \u2018fixities\u2019 \nno longer matter, or at least matter less, in a world of flows and \n(hyper)mobilities (Castells, 1996; Urry, 2000a). There is undeniably evidence \nof greater mobility, albeit unevenly, across a wide range of activities and \nspatial scales29. But for social life to be possible, for the economy to be \nperformable, fluid socio-spatial relations and flows require a degree of \npermanence, of fixity of form and identity\u2013 whether in terms of the boundaries \nof the firm, of national states, or of local places.  \n \nHowever, there is also a dialectic of spaces and flows and circuits, centred on \nthe necessary inter-relations of mobilities and fixities, of spaces, circuits  and \nflows. Circuits and flows require spaces in which their various \u2018stages\/phases\u2019 \ncan be performed and practised, while stretching social relations to create \nspaces of different sorts, fixing capital in specific time\/space forms and \nensembles (Hudson, 2001, Chapter 8). Spaces are both discursive and \nmaterial. Material spaces are constituted as built environmental forms, a \nproduct of materialised human labour. Discursive spaces enable meanings to \nbe both contested and established, permissible forms of action to be defined \nand sanctioned, and inadmissible behaviour to be disciplined. Recognising \nthat spaces are discursively as well as materially constructed implies that this \nprocess does not simply describe the economy. It is also in part constitutive of \nit, defining the economy as an object of analysis, constructing the spaces of \nmeaning and the meaning of the spaces in which the economy is enacted and \n                                                 \n28 It is an open question as to whether emergent properties lead to changes within the \nparameters of capitalist social relations or to a shift onto alternative non-capitalist paths. This \nalso raises key political questions about \u2018steering\u2019 changes along or between developmental \ntrajectories (Hudson, 2001, Chapter 9). \n29 Damette introduced the concept of hyper-mobility of capital in 1974. Thus the notion that \nthe capitalist economy has suddenly \u2018speeded up\u2019 in the last decade or so requires some \ncareful re-consideration. \n 19\nFinal draft, 20\/10\/2003 \nperformed. These spaces of meaning then become guides to social and \nindividual action. The same point can be made about concepts of circuits and \nflows, which are also constitutive rather than simply descriptive. As such, \nspaces, flows and circuits are socially constructed, temporarily stabilised in \ntime\/space by the social glue of norms and rules, and both enable and \nconstrain different forms of behaviour.  \n \nSpaces, flows and circuits are thus both the medium and products of practices \n(over varying time scales), based on human understandings and knowledges. \nMoreover, flows, circuits and practices are also instituted, situated in specific \ntime\/space contexts. As such, they are socially constructed and shaped (but \nnot mechanistically determined) by prevailing rules, norms, expectations, and \nhabits and by dominant power relations. As Law (2002, 24) remarks of \nfactories, markets, offices and other spaces of the economy, each is \u201ca set of \nsocio-technologies and a set of practices. But socially it is also a set of rules\u201d. \nSuch spaces are thus simultaneously materially constructed, a fixation of \nvalue in built form, a product of and an arena for practices, defined and \nregulated by socially sanctioned rules which prescribe or proscribe particular \nforms of behaviour. In this sense there are structural limitations on action and \nunderstanding but, reciprocally, these limitations are a product of human \naction, beliefs and values: structures are both constraining and enabling. \nStructural constraints are most powerful when they are hegemonic, taking \neffect because they have become taken-for-granted, unquestioned \ndeterminants of everyday behaviour (Gramsci, 1971). Everyday routine then \u2013 \neven if unintentionally and unconsciously \u2013 reproduces these structural \nrelations. Not least this is because of the existence of \u201cenabling myths\u201d \n(Dugger, 2001), deeply embedded in the beliefs and meanings in which such \nroutine is grounded, which have the effect of \u201cnaturalising\u201d the social and \nreproducing the structural. However, as structures do not exist independently \nof human action and understanding but are always immanent, contingently \nreproduced, they are in principle changeable. This is a key theoretical point \nand \u2013 potentially \u2013 one of immense political importance. \n \nBourdieu catches this sense of hegemony via his concept of habitus. Habitus \nemphasises the doxic (taken-for-granted, unthinking) elements of action, \nsocial classification and practical consciousness. He (1977, 72) argues that \nthe structure of a particular constitutive environment produces \u201chabitus, \nsystems of durable, transposable dispositions, as structured structures, that \nis, as principles of the generation of practices and representations which can \nbe objectively regulated and \u2018regular\u2019 without in any way being the product of \nobedience to rules\u201d.  They are \u201cobjectively adapted to their goals without pre-\nsupposing a consensus aiming at ends or an express mastery of the \noperation necessary to attain them, and being all this collectively orchestrated \nwithout being the product of the orchestrating actor of the conductor\u201d. \nBourdieu (1981, 309) later makes a critical point in insisting that habitus is \u201can \nanalytic construct, a system of \u2018regulated improvisation\u2019, or generative rules \nthat represents the (cognitive, affective and evaluative) internalisation by \nactors of past experience on the basis of shared typifications of social \ncategories, experienced phenomenally as \u2018people like us\u2019\u201d that varies by and \nis differentiated between social groups. Crucially, however, \u201cbecause of \n 20\nFinal draft, 20\/10\/2003 \ncommon histories, members of each \u2018class fraction\u2019 share similar habitus, \ncreating regularities of thought, aspirations, dispositions, patterns of action \nthat are linked to the position that persons occupy in the social structure they \ncontinually reproduce\u201d. While Bourdieu refers specifically to \u2018class fractions\u2019, \ncommonality of experience and identity could as well be based on \u2018people like \nus\u2019 defined via other social attributes, such as ethnicity, gender or place of \nresidence. Furthermore, historical processes of class formation will reflect the \nintersection of structures of class relations with those of other social structures \n(cf. Massey, 1995, 301-5). \n \n \n8 Taking stock \n \nWe need to take what people do and their reasons for doing it, their actions \nand performances, seriously if we are to understand how structures are \n(un)intentionally (re)produced and constitute \u2018guides to action\u2019, informing \nsocial agents of appropriate ways of \u2018going on\u2019. For example capitalists and \nworkers behave in particular ways because they understand the world in \nterms of a specific class structural representation of capital:labour relations. \nNationalists and regionalists behave in particular ways because of their \nunderstanding of the world as principally organised around shared territorial \ninterests and identities. Moreover, such behaviour may well be paradoxical \nprecisely because social actors behave in circumstances beyond their control. \nFor example, radical trades unionists go to work, even though they \nunderstand the capitalist labour process as exploitative, since on a quotidian \nbasis they and their families need to eat, to have a place to live and so on.  \n \nThe \u2018economy\u2019 is thus instituted, based on shared understandings, \ndiscursively established, regarding \u2018proper\u2019 behaviour and conduct by the \nowners and managers of capital and the vast variety of workers in factories, \noffices, shops, consumers and so on.  But these shared understandings and \nresultant practices\/performances are structured by understandings of what \ncapitalist production necessarily requires (a sufficient mass and rate of profit) \nand of how this can be produced. As such, they are shaped by and \nsimultaneously help reproduce structural constraints and the materiality of the \neconomy. Thus, capitalist business is based in a material culture of relations \nbetween people and things that ranges from the vast number of \nintermediaries required to produce trade, through the wide range of means of \nrecording and summarising business, to the different arrangements of \nbuildings (spaces of work) that discipline workers\u2019 bodies. These devices and \narrangements \u201care not an aid to capitalism; they are a fundamental part of \nwhat capitalism is\u201d \u201c (Thrift, 1999, 59). Of course, not least this is the case \nbecause a large part of these \u2018aids\u2019 is produced as commodities30.  \n \nThe recognition of different arrangements of buildings as spaces of production \nthat discipline workers\u2019 bodies touches on an important aspect of the spaces \nof economies and the ways in which these are both a medium for and product \n                                                 \n30 There are strong echoes here of Sraffa\u2019s (1960) neo-Ricardian account of capitalist \nproduction as the production of commodities by means of commodities. \n 21\nFinal draft, 20\/10\/2003 \nof human behaviour. More generally, economic spaces, circuits and flows \nboth help produce and are (re)produced by performance. They both constrain \nand enable different forms of economic practice. In this way consumers and \nproducers of these spaces both produce and consume their own (formally \neconomic) citizenship. Those who cannot produce or consume in this way \ncease to be legitimate citizens. Spaces and practices are \u201cbinding agents\u201d in \nterms of how economies are performed and subject positions created and \ninflected (Thrift, 2000); the same point can be made about circuits and flows.  \nAlternatively, and simultaneously, they are agents of social exclusion for those \ndenied access to them. \n \nHowever, relationships between agency, practice and structure are even more \ncomplicated because (as the Foucauldian comment about disciplining \nworkers\u2019 bodies hints) there are typically contested and competing \nunderstandings of what is and what is possible in terms of action and change. \nFor example, there is a struggle within workplaces between managers and \nworkers, a contest to define and dominate the \u2018frontier of control\u2019 (Beynon, \n1973). Equally, there are typically competitive struggles between capitalists \nfor markets and profits and among groups of workers seeking to promote their \ninterests in competition with other groups of workers (Herod, 2001; Hudson, \n2001). All must also be disciplined to accept the \u2018rules of the game\u2019 of the \ncommodity producing market economy in conducting these struggles, though \nthese rules vary through time\/space. As a result, there is a complicated and \nmulti-dimensional struggle for domination between competing views of the \nworld and material interests. Consequently, the reproduction of structural \nconstraints is a product of contested processes, unless, of course, one \nparticular view becomes generally if not universally accepted as hegemonic. \n \n \n9 Conclusions \n \nMy focus in this paper has been on conceptualising capitalist economies and \nthe spaces, circuits and flows through which they are constituted, especially in \ncapitalism\u2019s late modern phase. There are claims that this represents a radical \nbreak with earlier phases, and that in particular it is marked by an enhanced \n\u2018culturalisation\u2019 of the economy. This is an argument that I broadly reject, not \nleast as it conflates changes in intellectual fashion and perspective with \nalleged changes in the economy. Practices of production, exchange and \nconsumption, linked to flows of capital, commodities, information and people, \nare central to the constitution of the spaces of capitalist economies and are \nneither more nor less cultural than they previously have been (although they \nmay be differently cultural) and neither more nor less material (Lee, 2002). As \nsuch, spaces of consumption, exchange and production are linked via a \ncomplex circuitry of flows and at the same time constitute the material and \ndiscursive spaces through which these flows can and must occur. Circuits, \nflows and spaces exist in relations of mutual determination, socially produced \nin historically-geographically-variable ways. As Dicken and Yeung (1999, 125) \nput it, \u201cwe need to recognise the organisation and geographical diversity of \ninternationalising, regionalising and globalising processes and forms, \u2026 \ntogether with the multiple scales at which they are enacted\u201d.  A corollary of \n 22\nFinal draft, 20\/10\/2003 \nrecognising this diversity is a need for a variety of theoretical and \nmethodological approaches in order to comprehend the economy: for \nexample, political economic and cultural economic approaches. \n \nRecognition of the co-existence of spaces of production, exchange and \nconsumption also points to the ways in which the same individual may fulfil \ndifferent roles and niches within capitalist economies at different time\/spaces. \nPeople have different motives and rationalities, depending upon their \npositions in the economy: for example, as capitalists, managers of capital, \nworkers or consumers. They may also participate simultaneously in the social \nrelations of the economy in different ways in the same time\/space \u2013 for \nexample as consumer, producer and indirect owner of capital via their \nparticipation in company pension schemes. Because of this multiplicity of \npositions in the social relations of the economy, people develop multiple \nunderstandings of capitalist economies and their implications, depending \nupon their own variable positionality, not just in terms of class relations within \ncapitalism but also in terms of ethnicity, gender, age and so on. This has \nmanifold implications for the creation of (multiple) identities within the circuits \nand spaces of economies. Once again, the cultural and economic fold into \none another, with profound implications for political action. \n \nFinally, I have claimed in this paper that cultural economy and political \neconomy both can and should be regarded as complementary perspectives. It \nis the case, however, that there is comparatively little evidence that those \npractising economic geography operate in this way31. There seems to be a \nmild-to-strong tension on both sides, and quite a bit of mutual suspicion. \nSpecifically in terms of research priorities, there is precious little agreement. \nCulturalists tend to see political-economic geographers\u2019 choices of research \nfoci as unnecessarily centred on the formal economy\/production\/markets (and \nindeed certain industries) while political-economists often see culturalists\u2018 \nresearch choices to be almost wilfully trivial (for example car boot sales, or \nLETS, which are certainly conceptually intriguing but hardly pivotal to \ncontemporary capitalism). Seen in this sense, one group seeks to centre the \neconomy, the other to decentre it. However, another way of approaching the \nissue is to recognise that what is at stake here is precisely what is defined as \nand taken to be \u201cthe economy\u201d, and the ways on which different social \nrelations constitutive of different versions of economies are thought of both in \neveryday practices of production, exchange and consumption and in social \nscientific practices that seek to make theoretical sense of them both from the \n\u201cbottom up\u201d and from the \u201ctop down\u201d. Carrying out such research certainly \nrequires theoretical sophistication and recognition of the need for different \ntypes of theory but, in addition, empirical research of a variety of sorts that is \ngrounded in these different theorisations and their conceptions of valid \nevidence and knowledge. So, for example, more thoroughly understanding \nthe geographies of the automobile industry would entail political economic \nanalysis of the production (both as a labour process and as a process of \nmaterial transformation) and consumption of vehicles but also cultural \n                                                 \n31 This point was made forcibly, and fairly, by one the referees\u2019 of the paper. Much of this final \nparagraph is directly derived from his\/her comments, a debt that I am happy to acknowledge.  \n 23\nFinal draft, 20\/10\/2003 \nanalyses of work on the production line and of the automobile as one of the \niconic commodities of consumption in modern capitalism (exploring its \nrelations to advertising and the production of meanings), and including work \non markets for second hand, vintage and \u201cretro\u201d cars and extending the use of \nthe car boot itself as a space of sale for a range of other \u201cre-cycled\u201d \ncommodities. Such work, grounded in different conceptions of theory and \nsynthesising the results of different sorts of research and evidence, will \ncertainly not be easy, but is necessary if there is to be further progress in \neconomic geography. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nNicky Gregson, Roger Lee, Jamie Peck, Henry Yeung commented fully and \nconstructively on an earlier draft, while Peter Dicken and three anonymous \nreferees for PiHG provided equally full and valuable comments on a later one. \nI am grateful to all of them, and as will be clear at times have explicitly drawn \non their comments and suggestions, although I have no doubt that I have \nfailed adequately to deal with issues they raised.
