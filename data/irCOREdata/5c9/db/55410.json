Contemporary sewage management practices at many coastal stations are insufficient to prevent\nlocal contamination but no introduction of non-indigenous organisms through this route has yet been\ndemonstrated. Human activities, particularly construction and transport, have led to disturbances of flora\nand fauna.

The Antarctic Treaty System and its instruments, in particular the\nConvention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources and the Environmental Protocol,\nprovide a framework within which management of human activities take place. In the face of the\ncontinuing expansion of human activities in Antarctica, a more effective implementation of a wide range of\nmeasures is essential, in order to ensure comprehensive protection of the Antarctic environment, including\nits intrinsic, wilderness and scientific values which remains a fundamental principle of the Antarctic Treaty\nSystem. These measures include effective environmental impact assessments, long-term monitoring,\nmitigation measures for non-indigenous species, ecosystem-based management of living resources, and\nincreased regulation of National Antarctic Programmes and tourism activities.\nReceived 31 July 2008, accepted 10 November 2008\nKey words: Antarctic Treaty System, contamination, ecosystem based management, human impacts,\nnon-indigenous species, tourism\nIntroduction\nImpacts of human activities on the Antarctic environment\ndate back to the 18th century with the arrival of the first\nexploring and sealing expeditions. Harvesting of seals,\nwhales and penguins led to local extinctions as well as the\noverall near-extinction of a number of species. The end of\nthe 19th and the early 20th centuries, the so-called \u201cHeroic\nAge\u201d of exploration, brought construction of the first\nstations in Antarctica, which together with the development\nof whaling started a new era of sustained human presence,\nas well as a legacy of environmental pollution (Blanchette\net al. 2004). This process was accelerated by the\ninternational scientific efforts fostered under the\nInternational Geophysical Year of 1957\/58, and, since then,\nthe intensity and scale of human activities in Antarctica\nhave continued to increase. Users have encompassed not\nonly explorers, but also scientific researchers, station\nsupport personnel, fishers, whalers and more recently,\ncommercial and private tourists. More recently, the\nInternational Polar Year 2007\u20132009 has catalysed further\nscientific and public interest in the \u2018white continent\u2019, and\ninevitably given further impetus to human activity in and\naround the continent. Regardless of the nature of the\nactivity, survival in Antarctica necessitates the use of fossil\nfuels and imported construction materials, the production\nof wastes, and interactions with landscapes, flora and fauna.\nInternational regulation of the impacts of human activities\nin Antarctica began in 1948 with the entry into force of the\nInternational Convention for the Regulation of Whaling\n(signed in 1946) and the establishment of the International\n3\nAntarctic Science 21 (1), 3\u201333 (2009) & Antarctic Science Ltd 2009 Printed in the UK doi:10.1017\/S0954102009001722\nWhaling Commission (IWC). In 1961, the Antarctic Treaty\n(signed in 1959) entered into force. It stipulated the\nprohibition of military activities and nuclear testing in the\narea south of 608S and required Treaty Parties to take\nmeasures regarding the preservation and conservation of\nliving resources in Antarctica. Over the next 50 years, the\nAntarctic Treaty System (ATS) has expanded to include the\nAntarctic Treaty and three other legal instruments. The first\naddition to the ATS was the Agreed Measures on the\nConservation of Flora and Fauna (signed in 1964, entered\ninto force 1982), which provides protection for native\nmammals and birds. Many of its measures have since been\nsubsumed or developed in the Annexes to the\nEnvironmental Protocol (see below). The Convention for\nthe Conservation of Antarctic Seals (signed in 1972,\nentered into force in 1978) sets harvesting limits for seals\nshould sealing recommence and sets aside several seal\nreserves. Management of fisheries was initiated when the\nConvention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine\nLiving Resources (CCAMLR) (signed in 1980) came into\nforce in 1982. The Protocol on Environmental Protection to\nthe Antarctic Treaty (signed in 1991, and more commonly\nreferred to as the Environmental Protocol or Madrid\nProtocol) came into force in 1998. It prohibits mineral\nresource activities and amongst other things\nstipulates, that:\n\u201cThe protection of the Antarctic environment and\ndependent and associated ecosystems and the intrinsic\nvalue of Antarctica, including its wilderness and\naesthetic values and its value as an area for the\nconduct of scientific research, in particular research\nessential to understanding the global environment,\nshall be fundamental considerations in the planning\nand conduct of all activities in the Antarctic Treaty\narea.\u201d\nOver the past decade, the intensity and diversity of human\nactivities have continued to increase. According to the\nCouncil of Managers of Antarctic Programs (COMNAP),\n53 active research stations now exist in Antarctica, with a\npeak capacity of approximately 4000 people in summer\nand 1000 in winter. New stations and transport logistics\ncontinue to be developed, shortening the travel time that it\ntakes to access the Antarctic continent (Frenot et al. 2005)\nand allowing research to take place further into the remote\npolar plateau. For nearly 40 years, only two stations existed\non the polar plateau: the United State\u2019s Amundsen-Scott\nBase at South Pole and Russia\u2019s Vostok Station at the\ncontinent\u2019s \u201cPole of Inaccessibility\u201d. Since 1995, three new\nstations have been built on the plateau, with another\ncurrently being planned. Increased numbers of\nintercontinental cruises and flights have made it faster and\ncheaper to bring more people to Antarctica. In the last\n10 years, the numbers of tourists visiting and landing in\nthe Antarctic region has increased by over three-fold\n(IAATO 2008). Tourism brought 60 000 passengers, crew\nand staff to Antarctica during summer 2006\u20132007, with\none ship alone carrying over 3000 passengers (IAATO\n2007). Fishing activities, initiated in the 1960s, have\ncontinued in the South Atlantic and Indian Ocean sectors\nof the Southern Ocean, and have also expanded southward\ntowards the continent, including the hitherto unexploited\nRoss Sea. Shipping incidents that took place during 2007\nalone - the sinking of the MS Nordkapp and MS Explorer,\ncollision of the MS Fram with a glacier, rescue of a\ndisabled fishing vessel as well as a fire onboard the\nNisshin Maru - bring into sharp focus the expansion of\nenvironmental and safety risks.\nIn view of the probable continuing expansion in intensity\nand diversity of human activities in Antarctica, it is timely to\nprovide a review of the state of knowledge of human impacts\nand their management in the Antarctic and the Southern\nOcean. The purpose of this review is to 1) provide a wide-\nranging assessment of recent scientific studies relating\nto the existence and implications of human impacts on\nthe southern polar environment, 2) examine how the\ninformation provided by human impacts research can be\nfed back into the current environmental management\nregimes (primarily the Environmental Protocol and\nCCAMLR) in order to inform decisions, and 3) discuss\nwhat is needed to improve the management and\nminimization of environmental impacts and to strengthen\nthe protection of the Antarctic environment in face of\nchanging demands in the 21st century. Such a compilation\nand assessment of information can provide an objective\nbaseline against which improvements can be measured, and\nwill inform ongoing debates, both in public fora and within\nthe ATS, on the future direction, mechanisms and\nimplementation of environmental management as well as\nenhancing the importance of stewardship in Antarctica.\nIn the 1990s, around the time of the negotiation of the\nEnvironmental Protocol, a large amount of research on the\nimpacts of human activities in Antarctica was produced.\nMuch of this research has been reviewed in textbooks,\nincluding Hansom & Gordon (1998), Bargagli (2005)\nand Knox (2006). Research coverage focussed on\nenvironmental pollution, disturbance to flora and fauna,\nand fishery-related impacts on marine ecosystems. Since\nthen, research on human impacts has been expanded and\ndiversified by researchers from many different countries. In\nthe present study, we aim to pick up where these earlier\nreviews have left off and assess recent research and\nevidence on the impacts of human activities in Antarctica\nover the past decade (1998\u20132008). We intentionally focus\nmainly on studies published since 1998, and on the area\nsouth of 608S where the Antarctic Treaty applies; this is\nthe period covered, too, in the recent analysis of Halpern\net al. (2008), which summarized human impacts on the\nworld\u2019s oceans. However, we also draw on examples from\nthe sub-\/peri-Antarctic islands and the area covered by\nT. TIN et al.4\nCCAMLR that extends north of 608S up to the Antarctic\nPolar Front, as they often provide relevant information,\ngiven the similarities in native biota, the progression along\nenvironmental gradients from sub- to maritime Antarctic\nconditions and trends in human activity. Maintaining and\noperating stations and their associated logistics and\nscientific activities, tourism and fisheries are the main\nactivities that currently take place in Antarctica. Their\nimpacts - chemical and sewage contamination, disturbance\nof terrestrial and marine ecosystems and alteration of\nfoodwebs - are considered here. Our main source of\ninformation comes from studies published in peer-reviewed\njournals. However, in the cases where few published\nstudies are available, and especially in the discussion of the\nAntarctic environmental management regimes, we also\nmake use of documents from the ATS secretariat and\nCCAMLR to provide supplementary information. While\ncare has been taken to be as comprehensive as possible in\nthe review, it must be noted that not all activities or studies\nundertaken in Antarctica are reflected in the accessible\nliterature. We also recognize that other fundamentally\nimportant impacts also arise from human activities that\noriginate beyond Antarctica itself, in particular relating to\nglobal climate change, ozone depletion, and long-range\npollution, but these lie beyond the scope of this paper, and\nwe refer the reader to wider authoritative recent reviews in\nthis context (e.g. Bargagli 2005, Turner et al. 2005,\nBergstrom et al. 2006).\nChemicals\nChemical contamination, especially through fuel spills and\nexhaust gases, is the most widespread environmental\nimpact of human activities in Antarctica (Bargagli 2005).\nContamination from land-based operations typically\nextends for hundreds of metres rather than kilometres (e.g.\nKennicutt 2003, Stark et al. 2003b, 2005) although the\nmarine fuel spill associated with the Bahia Paraiso - the\nlargest spill to date in Antarctica - was much more\nextensive, affecting an area of about 3 km radius\n(Kennicutt et al. 1991). For contamination emanating from\nterrestrial sources, flux is highly variable within and\nbetween seasons (Sheppard et al. 2000, Snape et al. 2002).\nFor example, the abandoned waste site at Wilkes Station in\nEast Antarctica sometimes melts very little, and there is\nalmost no spread of contamination. In contrast, in years of\nextensive melting, a plume of fuel has been observed\nto extend out into Newcomb Bay for several kilometres\n(S. Potter, Australian Antarctic Division, personal\ncommunication 2008). Several chemical and biological\nstudies from a range of terrestrial and nearshore marine\nhabitats all indicate that contaminants and their associated\nimpacts are long-lived in the Antarctic environment. Some\ncontaminated sites, such as the well-studied Winter\nQuarters Bay which served as a dumpsite for McMurdo\nStation on Ross Island until the mid-1980s, are as\ncontaminated as the most contaminated marine\nenvironments anywhere. The sorts of impacts adjacent to\nstations are similar in many ways to those seen in\ntemperate regions, but are all the more significant because\nthey have impacted relatively rare habitat types, natural\nattenuation rates are very slow, and mounting evidence also\nindicates that individuals and communities are more\nsensitive to contamination in cold regions (e.g. King &\nRiddle 2001, Schafer et al. 2007).\nBefore 1998, scientific research on locally derived\ncontaminants in the Antarctic focussed on four commonly\nadopted aspects of assessment involving definition of the\nnature of the contamination, its distribution, environmental\nimpact, and an estimation of its longevity (e.g. Kennicutt\net al. 1991, Green et al. 1992, Lenihan et al. 1995,\nMcDonald & Murrell 1997). Research undertaken since\n1998 has continued on these four aspects, but has become\nmore process-oriented. Chemical fingerprinting, elucidation\nof biogeochemical processes and pathways, ecological risk\nassessment methods and remediation research are among\nsome of the areas where significant advances have\nbeen made.\nSources of contamination\nRecent studies have further defined the nature of local\nchemical contamination in Antarctica and the main sources\nor types of chemical contamination are now well\nestablished: fuel spills, heavy metals\/metalloids (typically\ncopper, lead, zinc, cadmium, mercury, arsenic) and\npolychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination derived from\nabandoned waste disposal sites, chemicals disposed of\nthrough the sewage system including metals and\npolybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants, as\nwell as the release of other persistent contaminants, such\nas polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and\npolychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs), from combustion\nprocesses (e.g. Snape et al. 2001b, Santos et al. 2005, Negri\net al. 2006, Hale et al. 2008). A significant amount of\npersistent atmospheric contaminants is also transported to\nAntarctica from other continents, especially in the Southern\nHemisphere. The import of trace gases such as carbon\ndioxide (from the burning of biomass and fossil fuels) and\nchlorofluorocarbons (CFCs, used as flame-retardants and\nrefrigerants) has significantly changed the Antarctic\natmosphere in recent decades. Through sea ice, persistent\natmospheric contaminants are also transferred to water and\norganisms and can accumulate in tissues and biomagnify in\nfood chains. For example, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene\n(DDE), a derivative of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane\n(DDT), a pesticide that was used globally, has been found to\nbe widespread in Antarctic organisms (Bargagli 2005)\ndespite restrictions on its use under the Stockholm\nConvention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.\nHUMAN IMPACTS REVIEW 5\nChemical contamination from abandoned waste disposal\nsites and past fuel spills are a legacy from when\nenvironmental management was less stringent prior to the\nentry into force of the Environmental Protocol in 1998\n(Fig. 1). There is no comprehensive inventory of\ncontamination in Antarctica, although the amount of\ncontaminated soil and waste has been estimated to be of the\norder 1\u201310 million m3 (Snape et al. 2001b). In global\nterms, this is a very small volume of contaminated material,\nand Antarctica\u2019s overall contamination legacy is not a large\nfootprint in absolute terms. To put the amount of\ncontamination into context, however, requires consideration\nof the proportion of habitat that is affected and the\ngeographic scale of assessment. Only about 0.34% of the\nAntarctic continental area is ice-free (BAS 2004), mostly in\nthe Peninsula and remote mountain regions. The total\nsurface area of rocky outcrops within 5 km of the coast has\nbeen estimated to be around 5970 km2 (D. Smith, Australian\nAntarctic Data Centre, personal communication 2008). This\narea encompasses all Antarctic terrestrial maritime land with\nrock and soil, and, combined with the shallow nearshore\nareas, is a very rare and unique type of habitat on a\ncontinent that is mostly ice-covered. It is often these isolated\nAntarctic oases where most wildlife congregates, and\ncoincidentally this is also where most of the research\nstations are located and where tourists visit. Viewed this\nway, it becomes practicable to visualize an area about six\ntimes the size of King George Island, representing the total\ncoastal Antarctic polar habitat with rock\/soil and shallow\nwater, being occupied by 53 active research stations as well\nas a number of disused stations and infrastructure, many\nwith one or more abandoned waste disposal areas and\/or\nfuel contaminated soil, and a contaminated footprint in the\nadjacent marine ecosystem. Whilst in some cases it appears\nthat the footprint can extend for up to several hundred\nmetres offshore, the marine effect has yet to be investigated\nfor most coastal stations with the extent of outward ripple\neffects unknown. Thus, Antarctic chemical contamination\nmay be limited in its absolute areal extent, but the\nsignificance of its impact is magnified as it affects a large\nproportion of an extremely rare habitat. Using the language\nof the Environmental Protocol, the impacts of such\nchemicals in the Antarctic environment are neither \u201cminor\u201d\nnor \u201ctransitory\u201d (see Pineschi 2001), and without active\nremediation and further changes in management practices,\nlocalized chemical contamination will continue to have a\nsignificant and long-term impact both on the environment\nand on scientific research.\nChemical contamination associated with on-going\nsewage disposal is of growing concern. Hale et al.\n(2008) found that contemporary sewage management\npractices at McMurdo Station and Scott Base are\ninsufficient to prevent the local dispersal and accumulation\nof PBDE. These types of contaminants, like the more\ncommonly known globally-dispersed persistent organic\npollutants, such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT)\nand hexachlorobenzene, are important contaminants in the\nAntarctic because they are highly persistent, bioaccumulate\nand are toxic (Weber & Goerke 2003, Goerke et al. 2004).\nPBDE derived from materials on station that were treated\nwith flame retardants were found in dust, wastewater\ntreatment sludge, and sediment and fish immediately\nadjacent to the sewage outfall. Hale et al. (2008) found that\nlevels of PBDE in these fish are comparable to urbanized\nareas in North America, and concluded that wastewater\nmaceration alone, as allowed under the Environmental\nProtocol, is permitting significant PBDE and other\nchemical contamination.\nOther minor sources of local contamination include blown\ncement dust (Adamson et al. 1994), airborne pollution from\nexhaust emissions and incineration (O\u2019Brien et al. 2004), and\nisolated contamination events associated with our everyday\npresence in Antarctica. Near-shore sediments in Winter\nQuarters Bay, McMurdo Sound have also been found to be\ncontaminated with butyltin, probably as a result of abrasion\nof antifouling paint from the hulls of icebreakers or from\nship groundings (Negri et al. 2004).\nSeveral detailed chemical studies have attempted to\nfingerprint the source of contaminants or to use chemical\nsignatures to delineate the timing of contamination or rates\nand mechanisms of degradation. For example, Townsend &\nSnape (2002, 2008) used stable lead isotopes to document\nthe distribution of Australian-derived lead contamination\nadjacent to Casey Station (constructed and operated by\nAustralia since 1969), and to differentiate Australian- and\nAmerican-derived lead sources adjacent to the nearby\nabandoned Wilkes Station (constructed by the US in 1957\nand operated by Australia between 1961 and 1969). For fuel\nspills, Snape et al. (2005) and Rayner et al. (2007) used\nchemical fingerprints to differentiate between multiple spill\nsources where liability (and subsequent payment) was\nFig. 1. Waste disposal site at the abandoned Wilkes Station.\n(Photo by Ian Snape)\nT. TIN et al.6\nultimately determined based on the extent of specific spill\nevents. The fingerprinting approach has also been extended\nto monitoring natural attenuation rates and differentiating\nbetween various processes of degradation, such as\nevaporation, biodegradation and water washing, and for\ndetermining the efficacy of various remediation treatments\n(e.g. Gore et al. 1999, McIntyre et al. 2007, Revill et al. 2007).\nLongevity of chemicals and their ecological impacts\nApart from fuel spills that occur in high-energy marine\nenvironments, where dispersal is rapid, research findings\nshow that chemical contamination is long-lived in\nAntarctica. Gore et al. (1999) described fuel spills from the\nBunger Hills that were virtually unaltered after more than\n10 years in the ground. Snape et al. (2006) and Revill\net al. (2007) found that spills at Casey Station were\nvariably weathered and that evaporation caused substantial\nlosses immediately following the event but, after that, the\nfuel half-life was on the order of decades. Similarly,\nAislabie et al. (2001) described enhanced populations of\nhydrocarbon-degrading microbes more than 30 years after\nhydrocarbon contamination. Several studies have used\nrecently developed genetic tools to describe the impacts of\nfuel spills on microbial communities and relate the impacts\nto contamination (e.g. Evans et al. 2000, Aislabie et al.\n2001, Delille et al. 2004). The unpublished results of a\nlong-term oil-spill experiment undertaken at Casey Station\nby Stark and co-workers indicates that near-shore\ncommunities at several trophic levels remain significantly\naffected five years after the pollution event (J. Stark,\nAustralian Antarctic Division, personal communication\n2008). The longevity of contamination is also probably to\nbe influenced by the volatility of the chemical and the\nsubstrate on which it is deposited.\nRecent studies have demonstrated that chemical\ncontamination has caused ecological impacts at many\ndifferent trophic levels, from bacteria to vertebrates (e.g.\nEvans et al. 2000, Stark et al. 2003c, Negri et al. 2006).\nFor example, increased numbers of hydrocarbon-degrading\nbacteria (e.g. Rhodococcus, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas,\nand Sphingomonas) and decreased microbial community\ndiversity in soils have been observed, as have higher\noccurrences of pathological anomalies in fish (Evans et al.\n2000, Aislabie et al. 2001). Marine sediments\ncontaminated with hydrocarbons and heavy metals display\ngreater abundance of polychaetes and gastropods compared\nto uncontaminated sediments, although the response is\nlocation dependent (e.g. Stark et al. 2003c).\nSeveral studies have found that scales of patchiness, of\nboth physical-chemical properties and biological diversity,\nare high in the Antarctic (Stark et al. 2003a, 2005,\nGasparon et al. 2007). Manipulative experiments have been\nparticularly useful in demonstrating cause and effect of\nchemical contamination (Stark et al. 2003c, Thompson\net al. 2007). However, one of the major difficulties for\nhighly contaminated sites affected by multiple contaminant\nsources, such as Winter Quarters Bay or the sites around\nCasey Station, is that determination of the precise cause\nand effect of contamination is difficult. For example, Evans\net al. (2000) studied the effects of contaminants on fish in\nand around Winter Quarters Bay. They concluded that\nmetal contamination had only a limited effect on fish, but\nthat observed changes in the pathologic condition of fish\nwere more likely to be due to organic contaminants such as\npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and PCBs.\nCrockett & White (2003) advocate that the uncertainty\nassociated with attributing effects to specific pollutants\nshould be a focus of future research because it could help\nrefine management or remediation to focus on the most\npotent chemical sources.\nOn-site remediation\nThe importance of managing contaminated sites was\nemphasized in the Environmental Protocol through its Annex\nIII, Waste Disposal and Waste Management. Article 1 of\nAnnex III requires that past and present waste disposal sites\non land and abandoned work sites of Antarctic activities\nshall be cleaned up by the generator(s) of such wastes and\nthe user(s) of such sites. This obligation does not require the\nremoval of any structure or waste material in circumstances\nwhere the removal by any practical option would result in\ngreater adverse environmental impacts than leaving the\nstructure or waste material in its existing location.\nThe high costs, logistical difficulties, environmental risks\nand political sensitivities make bulk earth extraction,\ntransport and disposal (dig-and-haul) an unattractive\nproposition. The challenge for research scientists and\nengineers is to develop robust low-cost alternatives that can\nbe applied on site. A range of techniques has recently been\ninvestigated, including multistage water treatment systems,\npermeable reactive barriers, and bioremediation of\npetroleum hydrocarbons (see Snape et al. 2001a, Northcott\net al. 2005, Filler et al. 2008 and references therein).\nBioremediation could have the greatest potential cost\nsaving over dig-and-haul if it can be developed to work as\nwell on site as in the laboratory. New Zealand, USA,\nArgentina, Australia, UK and France have all investigated\nthe bioremediation potential of indigenous microorganisms\nunder a range of engineering conditions (see Aislabie et al.\n2004, Walworth et al. 2008 and references therein).\nTreatment by such means will probably take longer, but\nprovided off-site dispersal can be controlled,\nbioremediation offers a low-cost alternative strategy.\nQuantitative ecological risk assessment\nThe need for objective risk assessment information that is\nspecifically relevant to the Antarctic environment is well\nHUMAN IMPACTS REVIEW 7\nillustrated by the difficulties encountered when designing\nremediation programmes with an absence of clean-up\ncriteria (Stark et al. 2006, Snape et al. 2008). Others have\nalso noted the paucity of quantitative environmental risk\ndata for the Antarctic (Chapman & Riddle 2005). Following\nmethodologies developed in Canada and Australia, Snape\net al. (2008) proposed a weight-of-evidence approach to\nderive trigger levels and set remediation targets for soils.\nThe approach uses data from chemical modelling,\necotoxicology and ecological community impacts to derive a\nconservative table of trigger values (minimum values at\nwhich reaction or response is required by managers) for a\nparticular contaminant. The idea is that ecosystem health\nwill be protected from contamination if chemical levels stay\nbelow the trigger value. The physical characteristics of\nAntarctica, such as low temperature, seasonal snow or sea\nice cover, and limited soil development, influence how\ncontaminants behave and interact with biota in ways that can\ninfluence ecological risk. Trigger values derived from some\ntemperate organisms may be too high, i.e. not conservative\nenough to protect Antarctic or sub-Antarctic soil ecosystems\n(e.g. Schafer et al. 2007, Snape et al. 2008). Antarctic\norganisms take much longer to develop than similar\ntemperate species. Sensitive development stages last longer,\nand organisms are especially vulnerable to chemical\ncontamination over a longer period of time. King & Riddle\n(2001) found that, when the Antarctic sea-urchin\n(Sterechinus neumayeri (Meissner)) is exposed to copper\nand cadmium during the sensitive larval stage of\nreproduction, its EC50 values (the concentration of a\ncontaminant that creates an effect in 50% of the test\norganisms) are approximately 1\/5 to 1\/10th of the values\nfound in similar temperate species if the test is allowed to\nrun to the same stage of development. However, it remains\nthe case that very few comprehensive ecological studies\nhave been undertaken that can be used directly to feedback\ninto a trigger value.\nWithout doubt, Antarctica lags far behind other global\nregions regarding the existence of environmentally relevant\ndata for risk-based decision-making (Chapman & Riddle\n2005, Chapman et al. 2006). In accord, Crockett & White\n(2003) called for focussed research to quantify\ncontaminated sediment deposition rates, improved\ndelineation of sources and fluxes into and out of Winter\nQuarters Bay, and to identify specific contaminants that are\nresponsible for apparent toxic impacts. These research\nneeds are common to sites adjacent to all other coastal\nstations, and such information could help manage\ncontaminated sites that are difficult and extremely\nexpensive to remediate.\nContamination from sewage\nDisposal of the sewage waste generated by the estimated\n4000 summer and 1000 wintering personnel in the 37\npermanent and 16 summer-only active stations is a\nchallenge for Antarctic Treaty nations (Gro\u00a8ndahl et al.\n2008). Annex III to the Environmental Protocol\nrecommends that, to the maximum extent possible, sewage\nshould not be disposed on to sea ice, ice shelves or\ngrounded ice sheet, unless in deep ice pits when this is the\nonly practicable option. It further requires that sewage from\ncoastal stations housing more than 30 people is to be\ntreated before being disposed of in the sea. Without the\nocean to dilute and disperse sewage waste, inland stations\n(including those on permanent ice shelves) face significant\nadditional technical challenges for sewage disposal.\nConnor (2008) reported that, since the entry into force of\nthe Environmental Protocol, the level of sewage treatment\napplied at stations varies considerably. Many countries do\nno more than is required of them by the Environmental\nProtocol whereas others have taken the decision to treat\ntheir sewage to levels that exceed their own national\nstandards. Sewage waste and \u2018grey water\u2019 originate from\nstation toilets, laundry facilities, accommodation and\ncooking areas and may contain faeces, urine and associated\nnutrients, microorganisms (including potential pathogens),\norganic material (toilet paper and food waste), detergents,\nheavy metals, hydrocarbons and desalination plant brine.\nFishing, tourist, research and re-supply vessels also\ngenerate sewage, but this should be discharged into water\nmore than 12 nautical miles from the coast according to\nArticle 6 of Annex IV to the Environmental Protocol, and\nis unlikely to have a significant environmental impact. The\npresence of shipping vessels at any given location is\nrelatively short, but breaches to the provision on sewage\ndischarge location could be a concern. Nevertheless, with\nthe exception of McMurdo Station, which has a peak\ncapacity of well over 1000 people, shipping represents the\nmost common, large local density of people in Antarctica,\nas individual ships carry typically hundreds but sometimes\nas many as 3000 people.\nEcological impacts\nIn the last decade, most sewage impact studies have focussed\non benthic invertebrates, particularly near McMurdo and\nCasey Stations (populations of approximately 1000 and 50,\nrespectively). Before sewage treatment started at McMurdo\nin 2003, long-term release of untreated sewage led to\nsignificantly reduced benthic community abundance around\nthe location of the outfall. However, at all but the most\ncontaminated sites, biodiversity was equal or greater than\nat control sites (Conlan et al. 2004). Reduced assimilation\nof organic sewage material near the outfall was caused by\nthe formation of an anaerobic microbial biofilm that caused\navoidance by megafauna scavengers (Kim et al. 2007).\nUsing a technique that examined carbon- and nitrogen-\nisotope ratios in sewage, sediments and invertebrates,\nConlan et al. (2006) suggested that generalist benthic\nT. TIN et al.8\nfeeders could be used as biomonitors for sewage\ncontamination at sites across Antarctica. Studies at Casey\nStation showed that even comparatively low volumes of\nsewage could affect the near-shore marine environment,\nwith impacted sites generally having lower species\nrichness, biodiversity and variability compared with control\nsites (Stark et al. 2003a). Evidence suggests that sewage-\nderived heavy metals may impact upon soft-sediment\nassemblages (Casey Station, Stark et al. 2003b) and the\nclam Laternula elliptica (King & Broderip) (Rothera\nResearch Station, Lohan et al. 2001).\nComparatively little work has been done on the effects of\nsewage on other biological groups. In experiments, it has\nbeen shown that sewage may cause genotoxic effects and\npathological anomalies in Antarctic fish (Van Ngan et al.\n2007). Whilst a comparison of heavy metal effects between\nWinter Quarters Bay and an almost pristine site suggests\nthat levels of heavy metals found in sewage may have little\ndirect effect on fish (Evans et al. 2000). A recent report of\nE. coli from two fur seal pups suggest that pathogenic\nmicrobes can be ingested by marine mammals but it is not\nyet clear what the pathway might be (Hernandez et al.\n2007). Effects upon indigenous marine microorganisms are\nlittle understood, although George (2002) showed that\nAntarctic marine microorganisms could break down\ndetergents commonly found in sewage but at a lower rate\nthan in temperate locations.\nDispersal\nSewage contamination levels around outfalls depend upon\nthe biological and physical environmental characteristics,\nthe volume of sewage released and the degree of treatment.\nThe extents of several Antarctic station sewage plumes\nwere published before the implementation of the\nEnvironmental Protocol (Hughes 2004 and references\ntherein). However, since 1998, sewage plume extents,\nmeasured using faecal microorganisms, have been\npublished for McMurdo (Edwards et al. 1998), Casey\n(Morris et al. 2000), Dumont d\u2019Urville (Delille & Delille\n2000) and Rothera Stations (Hughes 2004, Hughes &\nThompson 2004). Both chemical (faecal sterols and\nhydrocarbons) and microbial (faecal coliforms, Clostridium\nperfringens and viruses) sewage indicators showed that\ncontamination was generally localized around the outfalls\n(see Table I). Indeed, Santos et al. (2005) found elevated\nmetal concentrations in marine sediments only in the\nimmediate vicinity of Comandante Ferraz Station sewage\noutfall. Ensuring optimal operational performance of\nwastewater facilities is notoriously difficult, particularly if\nsewage treatment plants are installed, making on-going\nsewage impact monitoring essential (Hughes & Blenkharn\n2003, Gro\u00a8ndahl et al. 2008). Ecological impacts are\nprobably modulated by the mixing regime of the discharge\narea. They are likely to be more marked if discharge is inT\nab\nle\nI.\nE\nxt\nen\nt\nof\npo\nll\nut\nio\nn\nfr\nom\nA\nnt\nar\nct\nic\nre\nse\nar\nch\nst\nat\nio\nn\nse\nw\nag\ne\nou\ntf\nal\nls\n,\nm\nea\nsu\nre\nd\nus\nin\ng\nch\nem\nic\nal\nan\nd\nm\nic\nro\nbi\nal\nin\ndi\nca\nto\nrs\n.\nP\nol\nlu\nti\non\nin\ndi\nca\nto\nr\nD\nis\nta\nnc\ne\nfr\nom\nth\ne\nou\ntf\nal\nl\nto\nsi\nte\ns\nw\nhe\nre\npo\nll\nut\nio\nn\nin\ndi\nca\nto\nrs\nar\ne\ncl\nos\ne\nto\nba\nck\ngr\nou\nnd\nle\nve\nls\nM\ncM\nur\ndo\nS\nta\nti\non\nR\not\nhe\nra\nR\nes\nea\nch\nS\nta\nti\non\n,\nD\num\non\nt\nd\u2019\nU\nrv\nil\nle\n,\nF\ner\nra\nz\nS\nta\nti\non\n,\nC\nas\ney\nS\nta\nti\non\n,\nU\nS\n(a\nll\nda\nta\nbe\nfo\nre\nS\nT\nP\nin\nst\nal\nle\nd\nin\n20\n03\n)\nU\nK\n(S\nT\nP\nin\nst\nal\nle\nd\nin\n20\n03\n)\nF\nra\nnc\ne\n(n\no\nS\nT\nP\n)\nB\nra\nzi\nl\n(S\nT\nP\nop\ner\nat\nio\nna\nl)\nA\nus\ntr\nal\nia\n(S\nT\nP\nop\ner\nat\nio\nna\nl)\nF\nae\nca\nl\nm\nic\nro\nor\nga\nni\nsm\ns\n(s\nea\nw\nat\ner\n)\n,\n60\n0\nm\n(\u0002\n1\nkm\nal\non\ng\nsh\nor\nel\nin\ne\nan\nd\n.\n30\n0\nm\nof\nfs\nho\nre\n)\n,\n50\n0\nm\n(n\no\nS\nT\nP\n)\n,\n10\n0\nm\n(S\nT\nP\nop\ner\nat\nio\nna\nl)\n,\n20\n00\nm\n\u2013\n\u00022\n00\nm\nC\nlo\nst\nri\ndi\num\nsp\n.\n(s\ned\nim\nen\nt)\n,\n30\n00\nm\n(m\nos\nt\nw\nit\nhi\nn\n20\n0\nm\n)\n,\n30\n0\nm\n(n\no\nS\nT\nP\n)\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\nC\nlo\nst\nri\ndi\num\nsp\n.\n(m\nar\nin\ne\nin\nve\nrt\neb\nra\nte\ns)\n.\n82\n2\nm\n;,\n30\n00\nm\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\nF\nae\nca\nl\nst\ner\nol\ns\n,\n59\n4\nm\n,\n20\n0\nm\n(n\no\nS\nT\nP\n)\n\u2013\n\u00025\n0\nm\n\u2013\nH\nyd\nro\nca\nrb\non\ns\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n,\n10\nm\n\u2013\nC\nan\nd\nN\nis\not\nop\ne\nra\nti\nos\n,\n61\n2\nm\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\nR\nef\ner\nen\nce\ns\nH\now\nin\ngt\non\net\nal\n.\n19\n92\nH\nug\nhe\ns\n20\n03\na\nD\nel\nil\nle\n&\nD\nel\nil\nle\n20\n00\nM\nar\nti\nns\net\nal\n.\n20\n02\nM\nor\nri\ns\net\nal\n.\n20\n00\nE\ndw\nar\nds\net\nal\n.\n19\n98\nH\nug\nhe\ns\n20\n04\nM\nar\nti\nns\net\nal\n.\n20\n04\nL\nis\nle\net\nal\n.\n20\n04\nH\nug\nhe\ns\n&\nT\nho\nm\nps\non\n20\n04\nC\non\nla\nn\net\nal\n.\n20\n06\nS\nT\nP\n\u00bc\nse\nw\nag\ne\ntr\nea\ntm\nen\nt\npl\nan\nt\nHUMAN IMPACTS REVIEW 9\nshallow waters or in an enclosed bay, while strong currents\nand rapid mixing are likely to dilute impacts.\nEnvironmental factors affecting numbers of viable faecal\ncoliform bacteria in sewage plumes include: the level of\nmicrobial input by the station population and transient local\nwildlife, seawater temperature and salinity flux and dilution\neffects by local currents and solar ultraviolet radiation\n(UV) (Hughes 2003a). The negative effects of UV on\nmicrobial viability are increased by high seawater oxygen\nconcentrations, but are reduced by UV attenuation caused\nby increasing water depth, sea ice presence and algal\nblooms. Antarctic solar radiation also naturally reduces\nbacterial cell viability with increasing exposure time and\ndecreasing radiation wavelength, ozone column depth,\ncloud cover and solar zenith angle (Hughes 2005).\nNot all human activities are located at the coast. Inland,\nsewage is generally disposed of either in \u201csewage bulbs\u201d in\nice beneath stations (e.g. Amundsen-Scott Base, Halley\nResearch Station), while field parties may bury faecal\nwaste in shallow snow pits, crevasses, or dispose of it\ndirectly into the sea when in coastal locations. The legacy\nof sewage disposal can be long-term. Using molecular\ntechniques, bacterial genetic material from sewage\norganisms was detected many years after deposition\n(Sjoling & Cowan 2000). Spore-forming strains such as\nBacillus and Clostridium sp. were shown to survive up to\n40 years (Hughes & Nobbs 2004), but faecal coliforms\nwere vulnerable to ultraviolet radiation and desiccation\n(Hughes 2003b). On the Antarctic Peninsula, regional\nwarming has reduced snow cover around some nunataks\nand coastal areas, resulting in previously buried (and long\nforgotten) faecal material melting out of the ice (see\nexamples in Hughes & Nobbs 2004). Some Antarctic\noperators do not permit dumping of faecal waste in the\nfield, and return it to research stations for disposal,\nalthough this itself raises other potential environmental and\nsafety concerns, such as the risk of spills and further\ncontamination during storage in the field, and health and\nsafety concerns for field and logistics staff who are\nhandling and transporting the waste. Antarctic Specially\nProtected Area (ASPA) management plans generally\nstipulate that sewage disposal is forbidden within the\nprotected area. While the Environmental Protocol\nencourages the removal of waste from field camps, the\ndisposal of sewage within the vast majority of Antarctica\nis still possible, without breaching the terms of\nEnvironmental Protocol. The long-term potential impact of\nsewage is not known largely because it has not been\nsystematically investigated.\nHuman disturbance on flora and fauna\nThe Antarctic terrestrial biota is species poor, lacking\nrepresentatives of many higher taxonomic groups (Convey\n2007). Faunal communities consist of invertebrates\n(Diptera - two species, Acari, Collembola, Nematoda,\nRotifera, Tardigrada and Protista), and plant communities\nlargely of cryptogams (mosses, liverworts, lichens), with\nonly two higher plants present. Biodiversity and community\ncomplexity generally decrease with increasing latitude and\nenvironmental severity, although the detailed pattern is\nconsiderably more complex (e.g. Clarke 2003, Chown &\nConvey 2007, Peat et al. 2007). For most of these groups,\nfine-scale survey data are lacking and large gaps remain in\nknowledge of their biology and biogeography. Continental\nAntarctica exhibits faunal communities which are amongst\nthe simplest on the planet (Freckman & Virginia 1997),\nuniquely in some areas lacking even Nematoda (Convey &\nMcInnes 2005). Most invertebrates are thought to be\nmicrobivores or detritivores, with true herbivory rare and\npredation insignificant, although few rigorous autecological\nstudies have been completed (Hogg et al. 2006). Minimal\ninformation is available for most microbiota. The application\nof molecular biological techniques is now leading to an\nincrease in our perception of diversity within continental and\nmaritime Antarctica (e.g. Lawley et al. 2004, Boenigk et al.\n2006, Yergeau et al. 2007), but spatial coverage remains\nvery limited.\nIn contrast, the Antarctic marine ecosystem supports a\nlarge number of species. Primary production can reach very\nhigh levels and is intensely seasonal following the\navailability of light and the sea ice cycle. Copepods, salps\nand euphausids are the dominant herbivores, with Antarctic\nkrill (Euphausia superba Dana) playing a central role\nin the pelagic marine ecosystem and crystal krill\n(E. crystallorophias Holt & Tattersall) doing the same in\nextensive neritic habitats, such as the Ross and Weddell\nsea shelves, sustaining large populations of predators,\nincluding squid, fish, seabirds, seals and whales (Clarke &\nHarris 2003). Nineteen species of baleen and toothed\nwhales migrate to feeding grounds in the Southern Ocean\neach year between November and May, as do a number of\nseabird species. While birds and seals spend the majority\nof their lives feeding at sea, many spend months at a time\nalong the coast on sea ice, or more often, on ice free land\nto breed or moult.\nThe increase in scientific, logistic and tourist activities\napparent over the last several decades in the Antarctic\nclearly leads to potentially much higher cumulative impacts\non the environment, magnified on land, as described above,\nby the very small total area of ice free ground in Antarctica.\nHuman activities can affect flora and fauna at many different\nlevels of biological organization, ranging through habitats,\ncommunities, populations and individuals. Impacts can\nrange from minor and transitory to severe and long-term.\nImpacts on Antarctic flora\nVery few scientific reports have described the effects of\nhuman disturbance to Antarctic terrestrial vegetation\nT. TIN et al.10\n(Poland et al. 2003). It is our opinion that this is likely to\nreflect a historical lack of coordinated scientific study rather\nthan a lack of disturbance per se. It has been stated that\ndirect impacts on Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems are\nrelatively minor (Huiskes et al. 2006); however, such\nsimple statements can lead to possible misconception. It is\ntrue in an absolute sense that, by metrics such as the area\nof ground affected or the number of humans involved\n(direct \u201cfootfalls\u201d), impacts can be described as restricted.\nOn the other hand, only about 0.34% of the Antarctic\ncontinental area is ice free, and it is here that most research\nstations are built. Human activities inevitably compete with\nterrestrial ecosystems, as well as seals and seabirds, for the\nsmall areas of ice free ground available, intensifying the\npressure on individual sites at a local scale.\nIt is tempting to propose that the general lack of scientific\ndocumentation of impacts to vegetation and soils over the\npast decade reflects a decrease in human disturbance to\nterrestrial environments since the Environmental Protocol\ncame into force, but there have been few objective studies\ngenerating data to either prove or disprove this assertion.\nThe available information on impacts over the past several\ndecades is discussed below, concentrating on the period\nafter 1998.\nWithout doubt, disturbance to terrestrial ecosystems by\npeople has been important where station infrastructure and\nvegetation are located in the same vicinity. Several studies\nprior to 1998 reported significant vegetation impacts\nassociated with stations and infrastructure, including\nphysical destruction of mossbeds and contamination of\nlichens and mosses with cement dust and metals (Fig. 2;\nChen & Blume 1997, Hansom & Gordon 1998, ASOC\n2004, Bargagli 2005 and references therein). Ohtani et al.\n(2000) monitored algal species and soil condition around\nSyowa station for six years and noted that increased growth\nof the native macroscopic alga Prasiola crispa could be\nused to indicate soil eutrophication due to human activities.\nBargagli (2005) noted that contamination by air pollutants\nfrom stations is usually limited to a few kilometres or a few\nhundred metres range, and that some species of lichens and\nmosses can be used as reliable biomonitors in this context\nsince they are long-term indicators of persistent\natmospheric pollutants. Where there is a high concentration\nof stations established by many different nationalities, for\nexample, on Fildes Peninsula on King George Island, there\nare many areas of damaged vegetation (ASOC 2004,\nUnited Kingdom et al. 2005, Peter et al. 2008).\nIn the sub-Antarctic, studies on human-formed tracks have\ndemonstrated that trampling has considerable impact on plant\nspecies and soils. Results from South Georgia (Bird Island,\nHughes 2006), Macquarie Island (Scott & Kirkpatrick,\n1994), and Gough and Marion islands (Gremmen et al.\n2003) were very similar. Impacts varied according to the\nnature of the vegetation communities and soils and\nincluded track widening, vegetation degradation and\/or\nspecies replacement, as well as alteration of soil\ncompaction properties. Very few studies on impacts of\ntrampling on Antarctic vegetation and soils have been\nundertaken, although vulnerability to even low levels of\ndisturbance is recognized (Beyer & Bo\u00a8lter 2002 and\nreferences therein). On Cuverville Island, Antarctic\nPeninsula, de Leeuw (1994) found that simulated trampling\nby a group of 50 persons on moss peat vegetation for one\nweek resulted in damage to the extent that recovery was\nnot possible during the same growing season. Tejedo et al.\n(in press) conducted a series of trampling experiments on\nvegetation-free soils in the South Shetland Islands as a\ncontribution towards Scientific Committee on Antarctic\nResearch (SCAR) the Council of Managers of Antarctic\nPrograms (COMNAP) recommendations for minimizing\nscientists\u2019 impact in Antarctica (National Science\nFoundation\/COMNAP\/SCAR 2005), and documented\nchanges in soil compaction properties and invertebrate\npopulations under different trampling regimes. Through\nexperimental work and examination of existing human-\nformed paths, it was concluded that even the lowest\nFig. 2. Bulldozer tracks over a moss patch on Fildes Penninsula.\n(Photo by Colin Harris)\nHUMAN IMPACTS REVIEW 11\nexperimental impact (100 pedestrian transits) generated\na significant effect on soil compaction properties and soil\ninvertebrates, and systematic monitoring would be required\nto avoid impacts exceeding their recovery capacity (Tejedo\net al. in press). On continental Antarctica (McMurdo\nSound and Dry Valleys), where vegetation may be limited\nto lichens, cyanobacterial mats and microbial cryptobiotic\nsoil crusts, Campbell et al. (1998) found that tracks formed\nin sandy gravel soils with as few as 20 pedestrian transits,\nand human impact from ground disturbances were visible\nup to 30 years later.\nImpacts in the vicinity of research stations\nIn view of the scarcity of reports of vegetation impacts in the\nscientific literature since 1998, Antarctic Treaty Inspection\nReports - reporting the inspections of Antarctic research\nstations - provide one of the few sources of information\ndocumenting recent vegetation impacts in the vicinity of\nstations. Seven Inspection Reports available since 2001,\nfour of which include inspections of stations where\nvegetation issues are mentioned, indicate to some extent\nthat impacts may have reduced since the entry into force of\nthe Environmental Protocol, although their limitations\n(Harris 1991) mean that consistency of reporting cannot be\nassumed. Two of the Inspection Reports cover stations\non the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula (United\nStates 2001, United Kingdom et al. 2005), one on Ross\nIsland (Australia 2005) and the other in Dronning Maud\nLand (Norway 2001). In general they indicate a widespread\nand high level of awareness of the measures\nand requirements of the Environmental Protocol amongst\nthe stations inspected, including the need to protect\nvegetation, although this was not always seen to be\ntranslated into practice. There is also some inconsistency in\nreporting detail - for instance damage reported to moss\nbeds on King George Island in 2005 (United Kingdom\net al. 2005) was not mentioned in the previous inspection\nin 2001 (United States 2001), but it is not possible to state\nwhether the damage had not been observed in 2001, or that\nit had occurred in the interim.\nImpacts at popular visitation sites\nOccasional anecdotal comments in the scientific literature\nrelating to tourist visits to Antarctica prior to 1998 indicate\nthat a certain level of trampling of vegetation probably\noccurred from tourists during that time (Chen & Blume\n1997 and references therein, Hansom & Gordon 1998).\nRigorous scientific data obtained either in this period or\nmore recently are largely lacking. Naveen (2004) reported\nresults from a ten-year study monitoring impacts at tourist\nsites on the Antarctic Peninsula since 1994; the report\nmeasured a number of faunal and floral indicators, but left\nunclear was whether any impacts were observed.\nThe tourism industry organization - The International\nAssociation of Antarctic Tour Operators (IAATO) - was\nformed in 1991 and currently represents over 90% of tour\ncompanies operating in Antarctica (IAATO 2008). IAATO\nhas collaborated with the Antarctic Treaty Consultative\nParties (ATCPs) to produce the document Guidance to\nVisitors (ATS 1994), its members have demonstrated an\napparently high level of compliance to both its own and\nEnvironmental Protocol requirements (IAATO 2007), and\nit continues to collaborate with the ATCPs to produce Site\nGuidelines for Visitors for specific sites. Site guidelines\nhave been adopted by the ATCPs for 18 of the most-visited\nsites in the Antarctic Peninsula area (ATS 2008a). Of these\n18 sites, only Barrientos Island and Half Moon Island,\nboth in the South Shetland Islands, have \u201cknown impacts\u201d\nto vegetation, while 11 have \u201cpotential impacts\u201d to\nvegetation (including the sites with known impacts). Five\nsites have \u201cclosed areas\u201d partly due to sensitive vegetation,\nand for two sites, guided walking routes are recommended\nto avoid vegetation trampling. Sixteen of the 18 sites\nsupport significant vegetation, and these guidelines include\nclear instructions to avoid walking on any vegetation\nsusceptible to disturbance. At Barrientos Island, successive\nyears of visits by tourist groups had resulted in \u201cthe\nerosion of multiple footpaths through vegetation between\nthe eastern and western end of the island\u201d (ATS 2008a).\nAs a solution, the site guideline describes a new guided\nwalking route which avoids vegetation trampling. Along\nwith the other 17 Site Guidelines, it provides a good\nexample of collaborative practical problem solving between\nthe ATCPs and the tourist industry to minimize vegetation\nimpacts.\nDisturbance to fauna\nAntarctic birds and seals are at a disadvantage in regard to\nhuman disturbance. Many species spend significant periods\non land or ice during breeding, haul out and moult.\nHowever, their escape response is not highly developed,\ncompared with similar species elsewhere, as land-based\npredators including humans have not been part of their\nevolutionary history. Only penguins and other birds are\nsensitive to land-based predators, such as skuas and giant\npetrels, and are very defensive of eggs and young (de\nVilliers 2008). Human approach may lead to direct or\nindirect consequences. For example, a bird may exhibit\nbehavioural and physiological changes in accord with a\nstress response, which in turn, if sustained, could have a\nnegative impact on reproduction and survival. Visitors\ncould disrupt a penguin colony. Disturbed parents may\nabandon their eggs or young, making them vulnerable to\npredators. de Villiers (2008), in a recent review of research\nover the last two decades on the effects of human\ndisturbance on wildlife in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic,\nconcluded that at some locations and for certain species,\nT. TIN et al.12\nthe disturbance associated with general human activities has\nlittle apparent effect on wildlife population trends, e.g. for\nAde\u00b4lie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae Hombron &\nJacquinot) at Palmer Station and King George Island\n(Fraser & Patterson 1997, Carlini et al. 2007), and gentoo\npenguins (Pygoscelis papua Forster) at Port Lockroy\n(Cobley & Shears 1999), while, at other sites and for some\nspecies, human activities have been implicated in\npopulation declines, e.g. southern giant petrels\n(Macronectes giganteus (Gmelin); Woehler et al. 2003,\nMicol & Jouventin 2001) and snow petrels in East\nAntarctica (Pagodroma nivea Forster; Micol & Jouventin\n2001). Bricher et al. (2008) reported that proximity to\nhuman activities is a significant driver of the population\ntrends of Ade\u00b4lie penguin colonies in the vicinity of Casey\nStation in East Antarctica. The majority of sub-colonies\nwith decreasing populations are located closest to the\nstation, although further investigations are needed in order\nto separate the potential contribution from station-related\nactivities, such as noise and particulate emissions, from the\neffects of visits to the colonies. Cumulative impacts of\ndifferent activities on Antarctic wildlife can be especially\nimportant as human activities, arising both from tourism\nand national operator activities, concentrate in and around\nthe station grounds, on roads, and in areas with easily\naccessible concentrations of fauna and flora (Fig. 3)\n(Pfeiffer et al. 2006, Peter et al. 2008).\nPedestrian approach\nWhen approached by humans, Antarctic wildlife may alter\ntheir behaviour. Studies to determine minimum appropriate\napproach distances in seabirds began in the early 1990s and\nhave continued (e.g. Pfeiffer & Peter 2003, Martin et al.\n2004, de Villiers et al. 2006, Burger & Gochfeld 2007,\nHolmes et al. 2008). Altered behaviour in birds may result\nin energetic and\/or time costs (Burger & Gochfeld 2007).\nSome birds display elevation of heart rate (e.g.\nWeimerskirch et al. 2002, de Villiers et al. 2006) or\nincreased expression of stress hormones (e.g. Fowler 1999),\nbut demonstration of direct fitness consequences of these\nresponses remain elusive. Gentoo penguins (Jouventin et al.\n1984, Holmes 2007) and southern giant petrels (Jouventin\net al. 1984, Woehler et al. 2003, Pfeiffer & Peter 2004) are\nespecially sensitive to human disturbance and repeated\napproaches to breeding wandering albatrosses (Diomedea\nexulans Linn.) influenced their chick survival (Wheeler et al.\n2008), but species-specific sensitivity varies according to\nsite [consider gentoo penguins at Macquarie Island (Holmes\n2007) and at Port Lockroy (Muller-Schwarze 1984, Cobley\n& Shears 1999, cited in de Villiers 2008)].\nWhether visitor impacts lead to reduced recruitment and\npopulation abundances of seabirds over longer time scales\nis difficult to judge because habituation may occur (Cobley\n& Shears 1999, Otley 2005) and individuals may relocate\nto other sites. It has, for instance, become evident that the\nbehaviour and the physiology of individual animals can\nbe affected strongly by parameters such as visit duration,\nvisit frequency and intensity and duration of contact\nby researchers (e.g. Salwicka & Stonehouse 2000,\nWeimerskirch et al. 2002, Pfeiffer 2005). This can have\nsevere consequences, potentially lengthening foraging trips\nand sometimes resulting in abandonment of offspring (e.g.\nWilson et al. 1989). Species, however, vary in their\nsusceptibility to human disturbance, although habituation\ntypically only takes place if disturbance is regular and\npredictable (de Villiers 2008). Van Polanen Petel et al.\n(2007) reported that, among Weddell seals (Leptonychotes\nweddellii Lesson) and their pups on Windmill Islands in\nEast Antarctica, habituation took place over ten approaches\nwithin two hours, while irregular visits did not result in\nany sign of habituation. At Dumont d\u2019Urville Station,\nAde\u00b4lie penguins have been observed to nest underneath\nstation buildings, sheltered from harsh winds, despite\nhigh human frequentation (Y. Ropert-Coudert, personal\ncommunication 2008), as do gentoo penguins at Port\nLockroy. Pfeiffer (2005) studied effects of human visits of\nbetween 5 and 100 m to breeding and resting southern\ngiant petrels and skuas. Scientists triggered the strongest\nreactions when they checked nests. However, unguided\nstation members and tourists who were walking off usual\npaths also caused an increase in flight and defensive\nbehaviour, and the reactions of birds varied according to\neach individual\u2019s degree of habituation to people.\nHandling of animals\nSome scientific research requires catching animals, handling\nthem and fitting external equipment, such as leg bands,\nflipper tags, tracking devices or \u2018crittercams\u2019. In some\ncases more invasive procedures are involved, including\nsampling of stomach contents by water offloading and the\nimplantation of various types of biological and\nFig. 3.

Devices attached to the body of an\naquatic animal compromise the animal\u2019s streamlining\nand thereby induce a modification to the animal\u2019s foraging\nperformances (e.g. Ropert-Coudert et al. 2007). This, in\nturn, may lead either to a decrease in the food load\ncaptured or, if the load is kept constant, to an increase in\nthe energy expenditure of the animal. Similarly, putting\nbands on penguin flippers for identification has led to\nincreased energy expenditure during swimming in the\nlaboratory, physical injury, and mortality during moult\n(e.g. Jackson & Wilson 2002, Gauthier-Clerc et al. 2004).\nOn the other hand, it has been shown in the field that while\nforaging trips increase slightly in length, food loads\nbrought back to the chick also increase among banded\ncompared to unbanded Ade\u00b4lie penguins, indicating the\ncomplexity of the issue (Dugger et al. 2006, see also\nBallard et al. 2001). In some recent studies, flipper bands\nhave been replaced with subcutaneous transponders, though\nthe information gained is not usually equivalent. However,\ntransponders, if not applied judiciously, could also\ncompromise survival in some individuals by introducing\nbacteria and causing infection (Clarke & Kerry 1998).\nTracking devices are often attached to the bodies of flying\nseabirds, such as albatrosses and petrels, and subsequent\nnest abandonment and extended foraging periods by the\nbirds in question have been observed. However, by limiting\nthe weight of the device to less than 3% of the body mass\nof the birds, the likelihood of these negative impacts has\nbeen reduced (Phillips et al. 2003).\nConstruction, noise and light\nThe construction of infrastructure could potentially result in\nsignificant disturbance to Antarctic wildlife. Peter et al.\n(2008) recorded a reduced breeding activity of Wilson\u2019s\nstorm petrels (Oceanites oceanicus Kuhl) during and after\nthe recent extension of the Chilean airstrip on Fildes\nPeninsula on King George Island. In the case of the\nconstruction of an airstrip at Pointe Ge\u00b4ologie in East\nAntarctica between 1984 and 1992, two islands were\ndestroyed, together with 10\u201335% of the nesting sites of\nAde\u00b4lie penguins, cape petrels (Daption capense Linn.) and\nsnow petrels. Breeding pairs were removed from their\nnesting areas by station personnel or left the area on their\nown. Monitoring over a period of 14 years showed that, by\n1999, the populations most heavily affected by the\ndestruction of their habitats have re-established themselves\nto levels prior to disturbance (Micol & Jouventin 2001).\nNoise and visual intrusion arising from aircraft operations\ncan also disturb Antarctic wildlife (Hughes et al. 2008,\nHarris 2005). According to de Villiers (2008), the impacts\nof aircraft operations on wildlife range from insignificant\n(e.g. Burton & van den Hoff 2002) or minor behavioural\nchanges (Giese & Riddle 1999, Southwell 2005), to\nincreases in heart rate and temporary nest desertions\nresulting in some egg or chick mortality (Wilson et al.\n1991), multiple nest desertions (e.g. Sladen & Leresche\n1970) and mass panic and the resulting death of thousands\nof birds (Rounsevell & Binns 1991). For example, Giese &\nRiddle (1999) observed behavioural reactions of emperor\npenguin (Aptenodytes forsteri Gray) chicks to air traffic. All\nchicks demonstrated increased vigilance and the majority of\nthe animals started to walk or run away at the approach of a\nhelicopter at an altitude of 1000 m. Hughes et al. (2008)\nalso found a significant change in the behaviour of breeding\nking penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus (Miller)) during\nhelicopter overflights at altitudes between 230 and 1768 m.\nGenerally, as the helicopter approached, many non-\nincubating adults and juveniles walked away from the\napproaching helicopter while all incubating birds stayed on\ntheir nests. Pfeiffer (2005) showed a stronger response of\nsouthern giant petrels and skuas to aircraft over-passes\nfollowing seldom-used routes compared to main routes. The\ndecrease in the southern giant petrel population at Point\nGe\u00b4ologie has been higher than that in other populations in\nEast Antarctica, and has been attributed, at least in part, to\nthe higher level of human disturbance there, notably the\nhelicopter landing zone, which is only 40 m from the\ntraditional main breeding area (Micol & Jouventin 2001).\nHowever, in some cases habituation to air traffic may occur\n(Cobley & Shears 1999, Otley 2005, Hughes et al. 2008).\nUnderwater, marine vertebrates are particularly sensitive\nto anthropogenic noise. The noise associated with all forms\nof transport is likely to be audible to animals under the sea\nsurface, and underwater explosions can in some cases\ncause mortality of penguins (Brown & Adams 1983, van\nPolanen Petel et al. 2006, cited in de Villiers 2008). Whale\nwatching from ships or small boats can also disturb marine\nmammals (COMNAP 1999). It has been suggested that\nhigh source-level hydroacoustic equipment poses some risk\nto cetacean hearing and could potentially lead to auditory\ndamage. Equipment of the strength and frequency\nimplicated elsewhere in the world is not used in the\nAntarctic, although lower intensities may generate\navoidance behaviour (SCAR 2006a, Kremser et al. 2005).\nLights on ships at night can disorient birds, and bird strikes\non vessels operating in the Southern Ocean are not infrequent\n(Black 2005). The level of mortality is generally, but not\nalways, low. The use of deck lights under conditions of\nreduced visibility in the vicinity of major breeding sites of\nburrow-nesting petrels, such as the blue petrel (Halobaena\ncaerulea (Gmelin)) and the common diving petrel\n(Garrodia nereis (Gould)), have led to occasional incidents\nwhere hundreds of birds collided with ships overnight, and\nwere found dead or dying on the deck at dawn (Black 2005).\nIntroduction of non-indigenous species\nThe simple terrestrial ecosystems in Antarctica are\nparticularly vulnerable to the various processes of\nT. TIN et al.14\ncontemporary environmental change, which include changes\nin zoogeographic distributions and colonization by non-\nindigenous species (e.g. Freckman & Virginia 1997,\nBergstrom & Chown 1999, Convey 2006). The lack of\nindigenous diversity allows the occupation of new\necological niches (including currently unrepresented\ntrophic functions and levels), leading to large changes in\nstructure and function in ecosystems. The responses of the\nindigenous biota to such changes can be constrained by\nfeatures of their \u201cadversity-selected\u201d life history strategies\n(Convey 1996) \u2013 while well adapted to survive the abiotic\nenvironmental extremes of Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems,\nthey generally lack competitive abilities and are vulnerable\nto increased competition and predation from invading taxa\n(Convey 1996, Frenot et al. 2005, Convey et al. 2006).\nThis vulnerability is already well demonstrated by the\nconsequences of the presence of a wide range of alien\nspecies on the various sub-Antarctic islands (Frenot et al.\n2005, 2008, Convey et al. 2006).\nNatural and anthropogenically-assisted colonization\nof Antarctica\nEven with Antarctica\u2019s geographical and environmental\nisolation, it is clear that natural transfer and establishment\nevents take place over evolutionary timescales, both into\nand out of the region (Clarke et al. 2005, Barnes et al.\n2006), via several potential dispersal routes (reviewed by\nHughes et al. 2006). At temperate Gough Island in the\nSouth Atlantic and sub-Antarctic Marion Island in the\nIndian Ocean, it is estimated that natural colonization\nprocesses have been outweighed by anthropogenic\nintroductions by at least two orders of magnitude over the\nfew hundred years since the islands\u2019 discovery (Gaston\net al. 2003, Gremmen & Smith 2004). It is not clear that\nthe same magnification can be applied to colonization of\nthe much more severe Antarctic continental environment,\nas fewer potential colonists will posseses appropriate\npre-adapted biological features (Convey 2008). In the\nsub-Antarctic, the last two centuries of human contact\nhave seen major changes in the structure and functioning\nof terrestrial ecosystems (Frenot et al. 2005, 2008, Convey\net al. 2006). These changes resulted from the\nanthropogenic introduction of many non-indigenous plants\nand animals, both deliberately and inadvertently. The sub-\nAntarctic provides a clear warning of the consequences\nof the establishment of invasive non-indigenous species\n(sensu Frenot et al. 2005) within the Antarctic continent,\nwhich is expected to increase in likelihood under climate\nchange. Although very few non-indigenous species are yet\nestablished in the latter region, it is clear that many\nanalogous transfers of biota do occur, with the major\nvectors including cargo, vehicles, food, clothing and\npeople themselves (Sjoling & Cowan 2000, Whinam et al.\n2004, Frenot et al. 2005, Lewis et al. 2005, 2006, Hughes\net al. 2006).\nThe early years of human activity in Antarctica included\nmany examples of the deliberate import of a range of\nvertebrates for transport, food and recreational purposes.\nSuch imports are no longer permitted under the Antarctic\nTreaty. However, on many sub-Antarctic islands (primarily\nKerguelen, Macquarie, Marion, South Georgia), the\nhuman-mediated introduction of non-native vertebrates\n(rats, cats, rabbits, sheep, reindeer, mouflon) has led to\nmajor negative impacts for nesting birds and their chicks\n(Frenot et al. 2005). The 1960s and 1970s also saw a\nnumber of botanical transplant experiments into Antarctic\nfield locations, particularly at the South Orkney Islands\n(Smith 1996), assessing the characteristics required of\npotential colonizing species. Again, such transplants are no\nlonger permitted, and the ATS provides formal\nmechanisms for controlling the import into Antarctica,\nhandling and subsequent destruction of non-indigenous\nbiota for scientific purposes. However, despite the clear\nstrictures provided under the ATS, there continue to be\nnew instances of angiosperms being deliberately imported\ninto the Antarctic and planted amongst native vegetation.\nThe most clear-cut example occurred around 1997 near\nGreat Wall Station, King George Island, when several\ngrasses, other graminoids and Cerastium sp., were planted\nin fellfield beside a vehicle track (Smith 2003). These\npersisted over several years and at least one species\n(Cerastium sp.) produced several new plants nearby. All\nplants that could be located were removed in 2005 (H.-U.\nPeter, personal communication 2008).\nKnown established non-indigenous species -\ninvertebrates and plants\nThe number of instances of non-indigenous species\nestablishing in Antarctica is much lower than that for the\nsub-Antarctic (Table II), with a total of up to eight species\n(five proven) known from the former, compared with\napproximately 200 from the latter. There is no confirmed\nevidence of any of these persistent non-indigenous species\nbecoming invasive. Additional to the small number of\nTable II.

There are no published\nstudies of population or distribution trends, although there\nare anecdotal reports that the area occupied by the\nP. annua population at Arctowski Station has expanded in\nrecent years, and there have been some partial attempts at\nremoval. The presence of these species is significant, as\nboth P. annua and P. pratensis are alien species that are\ninvasive on several sub-Antarctic islands (Frenot et al.\n2005, 2008).\nThe remaining known persistent non-indigenous species\nare invertebrates accidentally introduced to the immediate\nvicinity of Signy Station, South Orkney Islands. They were\nalmost certainly introduced during the plant transplant\nexperiments that took place in the 1960s as mentioned\nabove (e.g. Convey & Block 1996, Dozsa-Farkas &\nConvey 1997), although their presence was not recognized\nuntil the early 1980s. They are an enchytraeid worm,\nChristensenidrilus blocki Dozsa-Farka & Convey, and a\nbrachypterous chironomid midge, Eretmoptera murphyi\nSchaeffer, and both are otherwise known only from sub-\nAntarctic South Georgia. Given the climatic similarity\nbetween South Georgia and the South Orkney Islands,\nthese species illustrate the likelihood of successful\nestablishment by species already possessing appropriate\npreadaptations; the fact that the midge is parthenogenetic\nfurther increases this probability (Frenot et al. 2005).\nThree further records of non-indigenous Collembola\n(springtails) have been published from maritime Antarctic\nsites, but no subsequent assessment has been made of\ntheir persistence or status. The cosmopolitan springtail\nHypogastrura viatica (Tullberg) has been recorded from\nthe South Shetland Islands (where there are many research\nstations and much human activity) and Le\u00b4onie Island in\nMarguerite Bay (several kilometres from Rothera Station,\nAdelaide Island) (Greenslade 1995). This species is a\nparticular concern, as it or its congeners have become\naggressive species in their invasions of some sub-Antarctic\nislands, including South Georgia and Macquarie Island\n(e.g. Frenot et al. 2005, Greenslade 2006). Finally,\nFolsomia candida (Willem) and Protaphorura sp. have\nbeen reported from Deception Island, South Shetland\nIslands (Greenslade & Wise 1984). However, their\nassociation with human activity is unproven as, although\nthis island is the location of several research stations, it is\nalso geothermally active with areas of heated ground. Such\nhabitats encourage the natural establishment of lower-\nlatitude taxa otherwise unable to survive in the Antarctic\nterrestrial environment (e.g. Convey et al. 2000a, Smith\n2005).\nMicrobiota\nThe potential significance of microbial introductions to, and\nsubsequent movement within, the Antarctic continent has\nonly recently received any prominence, and very few data\nare available (Frenot et al. 2005, Convey 2008), other than\nthose relating to the risks associated with sewage (where\nnon-indigenous faecal microbes may infect local bird and\nmarine mammal populations). This is compounded by the\ndifficulty of separating a \u201cnewly recorded\u201d microbial taxon\nthat has been introduced anthropogenically, from one that\nis present naturally and is either cosmopolitan in\ndistribution or has dispersed to the region by natural\nmeans. Further, as with some of the invertebrate examples\ngiven above, even where evidence of introduction has been\nproposed, no follow-up studies have assessed status or\nchange (Convey 2008 and references therein).\nCircumstantial evidence of microbial introductions is\nprovided by studies that compare diversity at human\nimpacted sites (e.g. close to research stations) and pristine\nareas, assuming that taxa present only at the former are\nlikely to be associated with human activity (e.g. Upton\net al. 1997, Azmi & Seppelt 1998). A particular risk\narising from anthropogenic microbial introduction is that of\ndisease in wildlife (Kerry et al. 1999). Proof of disease\nsource is problematic (Frenot et al. 2005) as, even where\nevidence of disease exposure exists, alternative sources\nexist, as many Antarctic birds and mammals encounter\nhumans beyond the continent itself during at least part of\nthe year while some, particularly skuas and gulls, regularly\nforage around lower latitude ports and refuse sites as well\nas following ships at sea.\nAdvances in the application of molecular tools\npromise to improve our ability to identify non-indigenous\nmicrobes - for instance, while the classically described\nAntarctic algal flora is thought to be largely cosmopolitan\n(Broady 1996), molecular studies of various microbial\ngroups are now showing them to be more distinct and by\nimplication indicative of more ancient evolutionary\nisolation (Lawley et al. 2004, Boenigk et al. 2006).\nMolecular methods that ease the detection of specific\nmicrobes as \u201cindicators\u201d of human activity are also now\navailable (Baker et al. 2003).\nT. TIN et al.16\nIntra-continental transfer\nWhile controlling the risk of establishment of species not\nalready native to the Antarctic continent is clearly\nimportant, a separate but fundamentally important risk\nremains. The Antarctic continent is not a single\nbiogeographical unit and shows considerable intra-\ncontinental regionalization (Chown & Convey 2007,\nConvey & Stevens 2007, Convey et al. 2008). Therefore,\nthere are clear threats to regional biodiversity from transfers\noccurring within the continent. In this context, the strength\nof the biogeographical boundary across the southern\nAntarctic Peninsula (the \u201cGressitt Line\u201d - Chown &\nConvey 2007) is significant, as several major higher\ntaxonomic groups (in particular the Acari, Collembola\nand Nematoda) share no or virtually no species across it.\nMolecular biological studies now indicate that many\nelements of the Antarctic terrestrial biota are considerably\nmore ancient or evolutionarily distinct than previously\nsuspected (reviewed by Convey et al. 2008), highlighting\nan often unappreciated but important element of\nbiodiversity - that of local evolutionary intraspecific\ndifferentiation (see Chown & Convey 2007). The highly\nfragmented and isolated nature of Antarctic terrestrial\necosystems provides an ideal environment in which\ndifferentiation can occur. Therefore, these ecosystems are\nclearly vulnerable to the inadvertent transfer of native biota\nfrom one part of Antarctica to a different region where they\nare alien. The risks are further inflated as it is nearly\nalways the case that any such biota transferred are likely\nalready to be well adapted to the environmental challenges\nof their introduction site.\nEven within distinct Antarctic regions, analogous risks\nexist, as there are examples of isolated terrestrial\ncommunities lacking elements otherwise ubiquitous for that\nregion. For instance, Convey et al. (2000b) identified that\nterrestrial ecosystems of isolated nunataks on the northern\ncoast of maritime Antarctic Charcot Island lack any\nrepresentatives of the Collembola, a group known from\nevery other community examined in the maritime\nAntarctic. This lack of an otherwise ubiquitous biological\nand functional group provides an almost unique research\nopportunity to address fundamental questions in ecological\ntheory relating to species and functional redundancy and\nthe control of ecosystem structure. Any human contact with\nthe ecosystems of Charcot Island, inevitably originating\nfrom a maritime Antarctic location where Collembola are\nnative, creates a serious risk of the transfer of these\narthropods. In recognition of this risk, the ice free regions\nof Charcot Island have recently been proposed and\naccepted as a new Antarctic Specially Protected Area\n(ASPA), imposing stringent entry requirements on any\nresearchers proposing to visit this location (ATS 2008b).\nA second and final example relates to the exceptional\ninland terrestrial ecosystems of Ellsworth Land, southern\nPalmer Land, at the base of the Antarctic Peninsula)\n(Convey & McInnes 2005). These ecosystems are currently\nunique worldwide in being dominated by Tardigrada and\nlacking any representatives of the Nematoda, a group\npreviously thought to be ubiquitous in faunal communities\n(Freckman & Virginia 1997). These ecosystems face at\nleast two serious risks. First, as above, they lack many of\nthe major taxonomic groups that are generally common in\nmost other Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems, hence the\nprobability of inadvertent transfer of pre-adapted Antarctic\nbiota is again magnified. Second, this region hosts\n\u201cforward support\u201d facilities and field camps supporting,\nprimarily, operations of the British Antarctic Survey (Sky\nHi Nunataks) and tourism activities of Antarctic Logistics\nand Expeditions (Patriot Hills), as well as being visited by\nthe aircraft and staff of other national operators. Lying\nsouth of the biogeographical boundary formed by the\nGressitt Line, this region is clearly at enhanced risk of\nintracontinental transfer of species native only to one part\nof the Antarctic continent.\nMarine non-indigenous species\nThe potential for introduction of alien marine taxa to the\nAntarctic region has been recognized in recent years\n(Frenot et al. 2005, Lewis et al. 2005, 2006), but has\nlargely not formed a subject of study to date. Accordingly,\nvery few data or records of occurrence are available. The\nnon-indigenous green alga Enteromorpha intestinalis\n(Linn.) is well established in the intertidal zone at Half\nMoon Island in the South Shetland Islands, possibly\nintroduced via the hulls of visiting vessels (Clayton et al.\n1997). Lewis et al. (2003) investigated the possibility\nof transport of non-indigenous marine biota between\nTasmania, Macquarie Island and the Antarctic continent by\nnational operator and tourist ships, identifying three\npathways relating to the transport of i) planktonic\norganisms from the Southern Ocean and Tasmanian waters,\nii) epibenthic organisms from Tasmania, and iii) fouling\nassemblages. Lee & Chown (2007) and Lewis et al. (2005)\nreport instances of transport of marine biota into the\nAntarctic. Both anthropogenic and natural marine debris\nprovide a vehicle for the transport of adhering biota into\nthe Antarctic region (see Barnes et al. 2006), and may also\nhave a direct and negative impact on indigenous biota\nthrough ingestion or entanglement. While this risk would\nappear to apply primarily to the marine biota, many coastal\nsites in the sub- and maritime Antarctic have been\ndocumented to accumulate substantial quantities of marine\ndebris annually (Gregory & Ryan 1997), including some\nthat have been polluted before any human has set foot on\nthem (Convey et al. 2002). This, thereby, extends the risk\nof introduction to include intertidal, supralittoral and even\nterrestrial biota capable of surviving exposure to the marine\nHUMAN IMPACTS REVIEW 17\nenvironment during transfer. Again, while the potential of\nthese routes have been identified, no instances of\nestablishment of non-indigenous biota through its\nutilization have been identified. Somewhat inaccurate\npublicity has been accorded to the recent record of a\npotentially invasive North Atlantic spider crab species\nbeing recorded from a trawl off the Antarctic Peninsula\n(Tavares & de Melo 2004) and the potential for deep sea\ncrabs to invade from lower latitudes in the Southern Ocean\n(Thatje et al. 2005). However, the former relates to a single\nrecord, with no subsequent records or evidence of\nestablishment, while the latter relates to potential\ndistributional shifts rather than actual evidence of\nanthropogenically mediated invasion.\nFisheries\nThe history of the exploitation, management and protection\nof Antarctic marine resources follows the same pattern as\nthat of marine systems in the rest of the world. Exploitation\nof fur seals, penguins, whales and finfish in the Southern\nOcean have all followed the stages of exploration,\nexploitation, over-exploitation, followed by management\n(e.g. Kock 1992, Myers & Worm 2003, Pauly &\nPalomares 2005). Over-exploitation led to the decimation,\nand local extinction in some localities, of populations of\nAntarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella (Peters)),\nsouthern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina Linn.), and king\npenguins, as well as severe depression of marbled rockcod\n(Notothenia rossii Richardson), mackerel icefish\n(Champsocephalus gunnari Lo\u00a8nnberg) and the great\nwhales (Kock 1992, Croxall & Nicol 2004, Ballance et al.\n2006). Following the outlawing of take and the initiation of\nmanagement, with complete cessation of take for some\nspecies, king penguins, fur seals and elephant seals\nrecovered completely (e.g. Rounsevell & Copson 1982,\nLaws 1994, SCAR 2006b) while whales and fish have\nshown little evidence of recovery (e.g. Kock 1992, Baker\n& Clapham 2002, Barrera-Oro & Marschoff 2007). Some\npopulations of elephant seal have since declined, probably\nowing to prey depletion (Ainley & Blight 2008), while\nothers have remained stable or increasing. Since 1982, the\nexploitation and regulation of Antarctic marine living\nresources has been assigned to CCAMLR. As noted earlier,\nCCAMLR was created under the scope of the Antarctic\nTreaty System and applies to the Southern Ocean south of\nthe Antarctic Polar Front. It has attempted to practise more\nthan a single-species approach to fishery management: an\necosystem approach with extensive use of the\nprecautionary principle, which has been a paradigmatic\nexample for Regional Fisheries Management Organizations\n(RFMOs; Constable 2001, Croxall & Nicol 2004). Over\nthe past decade, scientific research has provided some\ninformation on the current status of fish stocks that had\nbeen exploited pre-CCAMLR. It has also provided\ninformation to assist with the management of the two main\nactive fisheries for the deep sea toothfish (Dissostichus\neleginoides Smitt, D. mawsoni Norman) and the crustacean\nAntarctic krill, along with a third, much smaller fishery for\nmackerel icefish in the Scotia Sea. The impacts of fisheries\non non-target species and the marine ecosystem in general\nare poorly understood (see recent reviews in Ballance et al.\n2006, Ainley & Blight 2008). One exception is the bycatch\nof seabirds during fishing operations, which has received a\ngreat deal of research, owing to severe decreases in the\nbreeding populations of affected species, considerable\npublic interest and pressure from conservation groups.\nImpacts on target populations\nFish\nComprehensive summaries and detailed reviews of the first\n15\u201320 years of finfishing in the Southern Ocean are\navailable (e.g. Gon & Heemstra 1990, Kock 1992, Agnew\n2004, Duhamel et al. 2005, Kock et al. 2007). Finfishing\nin the Southern Ocean began in 1961 with the operation of\nSoviet distant-water fleets in the south-west Atlantic and\nthen spread rapidly into the Scotia Sea. The fishery in this\nsector began on the marbled rockcod at South Georgia.\nThe stock was depleted within two seasons after about 500\n000 tonnes was taken (CCAMLR 1990). After some years\nof low fishing effort, the fishery switched to the mackerel\nicefish (Fig. 4). It is possible to conclude that the Soviet\nfleet significantly reduced rockcod and icefish stocks at\nSouth Georgia over three years before moving to the\nAntarctic Peninsula area (around Elephant Island and the\nSouth Shetland Islands) and the Kerguelen Plateau, where,\nagain, the stocks of the same species were overexploited\n(Kock 1992). Other fish stocks that declined substantially\nafter only a few years of fishing were the green notothenia\nFig. 4. Catch statistics for the marbled rock cod (Notothenia rossii)\nand mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari), in the\nstatistical area 48 (South Georgia and Antarctic Peninsula). (Data\nfrom CCAMLR database)\nT. TIN et al.18\n(Gobionotothen gibberifrons (Lo\u00a8nnberg)), the Scotia Sea\nicefish (Chaenocephalus aceratus (Lo\u00a8nnberg)) and the\nSouth Georgia icefish (Pseudochaenichtys georgianus\nNorman; Gon & Heemstra 1990, Kock 1992).\nIn total, 12 species of finfish have been commercially\nfished in the Southern Ocean. Data on stock estimates are\nnot available for all species or for all locations and, indeed,\nvery little information exists on the pre-exploitation\nbiomass of the exploited species. Published studies\ncontinue to demonstrate little recovery of many of the\nstocks that were exploited before the creation of CCAMLR.\nFor example, Kock et al. (2004) reported that no\nsubstantial recovery of the marbled rockcod has been\nobserved at South Georgia and off Elephant Island, more\nthan two decades after the closure of the fishery. Further,\nno recovery of the stocks of marbled rockcod or humped\nrockcod (Gobionotothen gibberifrons) has been observed\nin the particularly well-researched coastal zones of the\nSouth Shetland Islands (Barrera-Oro & Marshoff 2007).\nBarrera-Oro & Marshoff (2007) concluded that \u201cdespite an\noverall increasing trend of N. rossii (marbled rockcod)\ncatches from 1991 to 2006, the current level was half of\nthat found in the early 1980s (before the fishery), while\nthose of G. gibberifrons (humped rockcod) had further\ndeclined and remained close to zero\u201d. Despite the fact that\nsurviving individuals of the species have increased in size,\nthey have been unable to reproduce to rebuild the\npopulations, resulting in exceedingly low fish populations.\nAinley & Blight (2008) have hypothesized that a climate\noscillation may be responsible for lack of recovery. In the\nvicinity of Elephant Island, trawl surveys showed that 30\nyears of fisheries have had considerable impacts on the\nstocks of mackerel icefish, marbled rockcod, blackfin\nicefish (Chaenocephalus aceratus) and humped rockcod\n(Kock 1998). Jones et al. (2000) concluded that overall\nlevels of biomass around the South Orkney Islands are so\nlow that most fish stocks are probably not in a state that\ncould withstand even limited exploitation.\nThe fishery for the deep sea species Patagonian toothfish\n(Dissostichus eleginoides) began in the late 1970s in South\nGeorgian waters and the Scotia Arc, though the degree to\nwhich it was fished prior to record keeping is unknown\n(Kock 1992). This was the first fishery that CCAMLR had\nthe opportunity to manage, other than by closure. The\nScientific Committee of CCAMLR, in the absence of\necological data, has opted for what it believes to be a\nprecautionary approach to this fishery. It introduced an\ninternational scheme of scientific observors, and a\nconsensus agreement to establish a Total Allowable Catch\nFig. 5. Black browed albatross killed in an Antarctic longline\nfishery. (Photo by Carlos Moreno)\nFig. 6. Numbers of pairs of breeding albatrosses in study colonies at\nSouth Georgia, south of the Antarctic circumpolar front\n(unpublished data, courtesy of the British Antarctic Survey).\nHUMAN IMPACTS REVIEW 19\n(TAC) within small-scale management units. Due to its high\ncommercial value, the toothfish fishery has suffered\ncontinuing and pervasive threats from illegal, unreported\nand unregulated (IUU) fishing, with IUU contributing\nsignificantly to the total global catch of toothfish (Agnew\net al. 2008). By the early 2000s, the total IUU catch for\ntoothfish was estimated to be at least double the legal one,\nwell in excess of the aggregate global limit recommended\nfor the regulated fisheries for all CCAMLR waters. Some\nevidence indicates that IUU activities are under control in\nareas subject to national jurisdiction, e.g. Kerguelen Shelf,\nSouth Georgian Shelf (Croxall & Nicol 2004), but may be\nintensifying in others, especially over high-sea and oceanic\nbanks. This is particularly true in the Indian Ocean sector\nwhere extensive exploitation of large adult toothfish by\nIUU vessels could have already caused substantial, long-\nterm damage to the stock (CCAMLR 2007). Over the\nyears, the toothfish fishery has expanded farther south and\nincluded a second species, the Antarctic toothfish\n(D. mawsoni). The fishery has now reached as far as it\npossibly can, to the Antarctic\u2019s southernmost shores, those\nof the Ross Sea.\nKrill\nThe Antarctic krill fishery, in terms of tonnage, has been the\nlargest fishery in the Southern Ocean since the late 1970s.\nThe fishery is the largest one for a crustacean anywhere in\nthe world and has prospects for becoming the largest\nglobal fishery, especially as stocks of clupeid species\ndecline elsewhere (Nicol & Endo 1997, Croxall & Nicol\n2004). The Antarctic krill is a major component of the diet\nof a variety of species, that may rely increasingly on krill\nas finfish stocks diminish as a result of fishing activities\n(Alonzo et al. 2003, Ainley & Blight 2008). The krill\nfishery currently occurs in certain locations around South\nGeorgia, the South Orkney Islands and the Antarctic\nPeninsula, and is in total spatial overlap with the foraging\nranges of krill-dependent predators such as penguins and\nseals (species included in the CEMP, CCAMLR Ecosystem\nMonitoring Program). Excessive localized fishing effort\nmay result in significant impacts on species that depend on\nkrill for food, particularly during the breeding season. Up\nto the present, the Antarctic krill fishery has remained\nwell below CCAMLR-established total catch limits, with\nc. 120 000 tonnes being caught each year during recent\nseasons. However, future development of products for\naquaculture, pharmaceutics and medicine is likely to drive\ngrowth in the krill fishing industry (Nicol & Foster 2003).\nNew technology, such as the continuous pumping of krill,\nis becoming more widely deployed, in spite of the lack of\nreliable catch and effort data and understanding of its\nimpacts on larval and juvenile fish (CCAMLR 2007), or on\nCEMP species, assuming elevated take levels.\nIncidental mortality and bycatch\nSeabirds\nLongline fishing operations for toothfish began under\nCCAMLR supervision in 1986. It quickly became clear\nthat this fishery carried considerable risk of fatality for\nseabirds like albatrosses and petrels, which are scavengers\nand thus readily feed on longline baits, get hooked and\ndrown (Fig. 5). Decreases in albatross populations on the\nsub-Antarctic islands became evident in the mid-1990s,\nparticularly at South Georgia and Iles Crozet where the\nlongest series of annual population counts were available\n(Fig. 6; Croxall et al. 1998, Jouventin & Weimerskirch\n1990). Observations and census data linked population\ndecline to incidental mortality associated with longline\nfisheries (Croxall et al. 2007). Delord et al. (2005) reported\nthat 26 668 seabirds were killed between 2001 and 2003\nby legal toothfish longline fishery boats operating around\nthe Iles Kerguelen and Iles Crozet. Species included (in\ndecreasing order by number caught) white-chinned petrel\n(Procellaria aequinoctialis Linn.), grey petrel (Procellaria\ncinerea Gmelin), giant petrels (Macronectes sp.), black-\nbrowed albatross (Diomedea melanophrys Temminck) and\ngrey-headed albatross (D. chrysostoma Forster). The\nhighest mortality of white-chinned petrels, grey petrels,\nblack-browed albatrosses and grey-headed albatrosses\noccurred during the chick-rearing period. Longline vessels\nusing automatic baited lines caught many more birds than\nthose using manually baited lines (Delord et al. 2005).\nMortality levels from the longline fisheries in CCAMLR\nwaters were unsustainable for the albatross populations\ninvolved (CCAMLR 2002). These long-lived birds delay\nbreeding until ten years old, do not necessarily breed every\nyear, and only produce one fledgling at best when\nsuccessful. They are thus highly susceptible to adult\nmortality. In view of the mortality rates from longline\nfisheries their decline could be potentially irreversible\nwithin two or three decades (Croxall & Nicol 2004).\nIUU fishing has compounded the problem. The CCAMLR\nScientific Committee estimated that the number of seabirds\nkilled in IUU fishing alone could have ranged between\n151 000 and 543 000 during the ten years between 1996\nand 2006 (CCAMLR 2007b). Around the Prince Edward\nIslands, as is true elsewhere, seabird mortalities from legal\nand IUU longline fishing have led to significant impacts on\nthe breeding populations of several species of seabirds\n(Nel et al. 2002).\nOther species\nApart from seabirds, industrial fishing operations also\ndirectly affect other non-target species, including seals and\nfish, as well as benthic communities. Juvenile fish and fish\nlarvae are often caught as bycatch during commercial\nfishing for Antarctic krill (Moreno 1995, Croxall & Nicol\n2004). Fur seals may become caught in the nets of krill\nT. TIN et al.20\nfishers (CCAMLR 2003). Some cetaceans, such as sperm\nwhales (Physeter macrocephalus) can become entangled in\nthe line and this has occasionally resulted in mortality\n(Kock et al. 2006). During longline toothfish fishing\noperations, many grenadiers, skates and rays - up to 20%\nof the catch - are taken and discarded (CCAMLR 2003).\nCCAMLR has adopted interim bycatch limits for some of\nthese taxa, together with rules requiring fishing activities to\nmove a specified distance once a threshold level of skate\nand ray bycatch has been reached (CCAMLR 2003, Kock\net al. 2007). Little effort has been made as of yet to\nquantify damage of longline anchors and hooks to benthic\ninvertebrate communities.\nMitigation efforts\nStarting in 1992, CCAMLR took the lead in addressing the\nproblem of incidental mortality in fisheries in order to\nmitigate incidental take. International scientific observers\nwere put on board vessels not only to sample fish, but also\nto collect reliable information about the ecological\ninteractions with non-target species (including seabirds,\nother fishes and marine mammals) during fishing\noperations. One of the most important measures with\nregard to seabirds around South Georgia was to change the\nfishing season from summer to winter, as birds do not\nremain close to their nesting colonies during winter. Other\nmeasures used by CCAMLR to minimize incidental\nmortality of seabirds associated with longline fishing,\ninclude the use of streamer lines or \u201cTori poles\u201d to keep\nbirds away from sinking longlines, banning offal discharge\nto avoid attracting birds, increased weighting regimes for\nfaster sink rates to ensure that lines sink before birds detect\nthem, and night setting (Croxall & Nicol 2004). Seabird\nbycatch from legal longline fisheries in CCAMLR-\nmanaged waters became essentially negligible from 2002\nonwards (Croxall & Nicol 2004) (Fig. 4). However,\nnumbers of bird deaths outside of CCAMLR waters are\nstill high for several reasons. Firstly, IUU vessels do not\nemploy the mitigation measures that reduce large numbers\nof incidental mortalities. Secondly, Antarctic seabirds like\nalbatrosses and petrels move to warmer waters during\ninter-nesting periods, where CCAMLR-type measures have\nyet to be invoked. In the South Atlantic, the impacts of\npelagic fisheries off the coast of Brazil, Uruguay,\nArgentina and Africa are an important conservation issue\nfor many seasonal Antarctic species, including the southern\ngiant petrel, grey-headed albatross and wandering albatross\n(e.g. Poncet et al. 2006, Bugoni et al. 2007, Seco-Pon\net al. 2007).\nImpacts on marine ecosystems\nAntarctic marine systems have suffered major perturbation\nthrough hunting and fishing over the last two centuries and\nthe consequential changes in these ecosystems (see reviews\nin Ballance et al. 2006, Ainley & Blight 2008) have lost\nattention in current research (Ainley et al. 2007, see also\nNicol et al. 2007). The prevailing theory of the 1980s, the\nso-called \u201ckrill surplus\u201d hypothesis, postulated that near\nextermination of large whales in the 20th century led to a\nsurplus of krill as a key prey in the Southern Ocean\necosystem, with consequent increases in the numbers of\nother krill consumers (Ballance et al. 2006). While some\nstudies have found evidence that supports this hypothesis,\nothers argue that the loss of whales alone is not adequate\nto explain the population trends of some supposed key\nkrill-eating species (e.g. gentoo, Ade\u00b4lie and macaroni\npenguin (Eudyptes chrysolophus Brandt); see Emslie &\nPatterson 2007, Ainley & Blight 2008, McClintock et al.\n2008).\nThe impacts of fisheries on Antarctic marine ecosystems\nare poorly understood. An analysis by Ainley & Blight\n(2008) indicates that removal of demersal finfish from\ninsular and northern continental shelves during the 1960s\u2013\n1980s had significant effects on populations of fish-eating\npredators, such as gentoo and macaroni penguins, Antarctic\nfur seals (Arctocephalus gazella Peters), southern elephant\nseals, and Antarctic shags (Phalacrocorax bransfieldensis\nMurphy; see also Barrera-Oro et al. 2007). The removal of\nfinfish means that some of its predators may suffer food\nscarcity, some of its prey, such as salps (e.g. Salpa\nthompsoni (Foxton)), will experience less predation and in\naddition climate effects will become more prominent (e.g.\nOsterblo\u00a8m et al. 2007). This introduces the possibility of\ntrophic cascades rippling through foodwebs at the\ncommunity level, with changes in the medium-term\nbiodiversity and relative abundance of other species in the\ndemersal community (Worm et al. 2006). For example,\npreliminary information collected in waters off Ross Island\nindicates that fish-eating killer whales have become less\nfrequent and Ade\u00b4lie penguins have begun to feed on\nsilverfish (toothfish prey) to a greater degree during chick\nfeeding since the advent of the toothfish fishery (DeVries\net al. 2008). These first-order ecological effects in the Ross\nSea remain under study but the potential for trophic\ncascades is high (Ainley et al. 2007) in accordance with\nscenarios played out in other parts of the world\u2019s oceans\nwith the removal of top predators, of which the toothfish is\none (Pauly & Maclean 2003, Osterblo\u00a8m et al. 2006,\nDaskalov et al. 2007). Furthermore, the destruction that\nbottom trawling and longline gear can cause to benthic\ncommunities has become a topic of concern in the\nSouthern Ocean as elsewhere in the world\u2019s oceans\n(CCAMLR 2007, Kock et al. 2007). There is sufficient\nevidence globally that benthic habitats comprising slow-\ngrowing, habitat-forming, sessile species, such as deep sea\ncorals and sponge communities could take much longer\nthan three decades to recover from significant fisheries\ndisturbances. However, little information exists on the\nHUMAN IMPACTS REVIEW 21\nextent to which damage might have already occurred in the\nSouthern Ocean (CCAMLR 2007).\nDiscussion\nOver the past decade, environmental management of\nAntarctica and the Southern Ocean has taken place under\nthe framework of the Environmental Protocol to the\nAntarctic Treaty and the Convention for the Conservation\nof Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). In this\nsection, we examine how information provided by research\non human impacts can be fed back to inform decisions\nwithin these environmental management regimes and\ndiscuss what is needed to improve the feedback mechanism\nbetween science on human impacts and the management\nand minimization of these impacts.\nFisheries\nCCAMLR was established, as noted above, to manage the\nimpacts arising from the exploitation of marine resources in\nthe Southern Ocean. Its charter has directed it to be a\ntrailblazer in its field, attempting to manage at the\necosystem level and use precautionary approaches, and\nwhile much remains to be tested in terms of its overall\neffectiveness, it has brought many positive results in spite\nof continuing challenges. In terms of addressing impacts of\nfisheries on target populations, it has developed what are\nthought to be precautionary approaches to Total Allowable\nCatches (TACs) and specific policies to manage new and\nexploratory fisheries (Willock & Lack 2006). On the other\nhand, other than in local and national areas, it has not been\nable to effectively control IUU fishing, which probably\nexceeds the levels of permitted fishing over wide areas\n(Croxall & Nicol 2004). In order to address bycatch and\necosystem impacts, CCAMLR has put in place effective\nseabird and seal bycatch mitigation rules and other gear\nrestrictions. Its Scheme of International Observation\ncollects data on bycatch onboard fishing vessels, although\nit is not always widely used (CCAMLR 2005). The CEMP\nwas established to monitor the effects of the krill fishery on\nthe ecosystem by assessing change in the natural history\nparameters of krill predators. Data are being systematically\ngathered from a network of specific sites on selected\nspecies. How these data will be used in the decision-\nmaking process to establish and monitor TACs, however,\nhas yet to be seen (Constable 2004, Kock et al. 2007).\nCCAMLR\u2019s approach has so far focussed mainly on the\nkrill fishery and predators either directly or indirectly\ndependent on krill (Kock et al. 2007). Finfisheries, such as\ntoothfish and mackerel icefish, which are currently\nmanaged in a single-species context, are not included in\nthe CEMP or any other similar monitoring programme,\nalthough CCAMLR believes that its precautionary\napproach to TACs take these species\u2019 needs into\nconsideration. Little account, as of yet, has been taken of\nthe responses of predators or other elements of the\necosystem to proposed harvest strategies (Constable 2004,\nKock et al. 2007). Special consideration will need to be\ngiven to ensure that harvesting will not affect predators in\nunforeseen and sometimes indirect ways, in particular those\nfor which CCAMLR is unable to monitor effectively, such\nas whales, pack ice seals, many seabirds, fish and squid\n(Constable 2002). Marine protected areas, area-based\nmanagement rules and closures can provide needed\nprotection to ecosystems from the impacts of fisheries.\nBottom trawling is prohibited throughout large parts of the\nCCAMLR area, providing protection to sensitive benthic\nhabitats. Little consideration has yet been given to the\neffects of longline fishing on the benthic communities of\ninvertebrates. Finally, while it is within its primary\nresponsibility and expertise to designate marine protected\nareas, a management tool shown to be effective elsewhere,\nCCAMLR has, to date, taken very little direct action\n(CCAMLR Performance Review Panel 2008).\nProtection of native flora and fauna\nProtection of the native flora and fauna of Antarctica is one\nof the key environmental principles laid down in the\nEnvironmental Protocol and is elaborated in more detail\nunder Annex II to the Protocol, Conservation of Antarctic\nFauna and Flora. Since the entry into force of the\nEnvironmental Protocol, the deliberate introduction of non-\nindigenous species to Antarctica has largely been stopped.\nMeasures have been introduced to minimize the\ndisturbance caused by mechanized and foot traffic, such as\nthe production of guidelines for the operation of aircraft\nnear concentrations of birds and site guidelines for visitors.\nTaking and handling of animals is now regulated through a\nstrict permit system and is only allowed for research\npurposes. While measures are enforced by individual\nnational programs, SCAR is in the process of updating its\ncode of conduct for the use of animals for scientific\npurposes in Antarctica, with the goal of bringing this\nactivity in line with good practice elsewhere. A protocol is\nbeing developed to minimize the environmental\ndisturbance of human activities within Antarctic Specially\nProtected Areas (NSF\/COMNAP\/SCAR 2005) whilst\nSCAR has recently agreed a new code of conduct for\nAntarctic field science.\nIn order to meet the challenges posed by the increasing\ndiversification and intensification of human activities in\nAntarctica, additional measures to protect native flora and\nfauna of Antarctica will be needed. One such case is the\nmanagement of the risks of the introduction of non-\nindigenous species. The current level of knowledge on\nnon-indigenous species in Antarctica is clearly based on a\nvery incomplete dataset, with relevant information simply\nnot available for many biological groups (in particular, but\nT. TIN et al.22\nnot restricted to, microbial groups) and geographical\nlocations, or over the extended timescales required to\nconfirm establishment and population trends. Long-term\ndata are essential for the establishment of appropriate risk\nmanagement protocols, in identifying new instances of\nintroduction, monitoring the status of species already\nestablished and assessing the effectiveness of any\nmitigation measures adopted. Through the relatively limited\nnumber (in absolute terms) of access routes, vessels and\njourneys to Antarctica, it is amongst the most practicable of\ncontinents on which to apply control measures to minimize\nthis risk, in order to maintain its unique terrestrial and\nmarine ecosystems. Possible measures include stringent\nprocedures to ensure rodent-free status of ships and aircraft,\nlogistical planning to minimize the risk of intra-regional\nand local transfer of propagules to pristine locations,\ncontrol of visitor numbers and access to more sensitive\nor pristine sites, and cleaning\/sterilization of high risk\ntransport locations for aliens, such as cargo surfaces,\nfoodstuffs and clothing (important in both inter- and intra-\nregional contexts) (e.g. Whinam et al. 2004, Frenot et al.\n2005, De Poorter et al. 2006).\nThe rapid increase in tourism is another case which poses\nchallenges to the protection of native flora and fauna and\nto the general environmental management of Antarctica.\nIn the last ten years, the numbers of tourists visiting and\nlanding in the Antarctic region has increased by over three-\nfold (IAATO 2008). For many years, tourists arrived on\nsmall ships carrying 50\u2013120 passengers and were taken\nashore daily in inflatable craft with outboard engines. Since\n1990, larger cruise ships that could carry up to 500\npassengers, and from 2000 onwards, liners that could carry\n800\u20133000 passengers (not landing ashore) entered the\nmarket (Bertram 2007). The monitoring, cumulative\nimpact, and environmental impact assessment of tourism\nactivities has become a concern and clearly, long-term\nstudies are likely to be necessary to detect any possible\ncumulative impacts of ship-based tourism (Hofman &\nJatko 2000). Since 1994, researchers from the Antarctic\nSite Inventory have made repeat visits to sites along the\nAntarctic Peninsula that are most heavily visited by\nexpedition tourists, and to sites which are most prone to\npotential environmental disturbance from human visitors\n(Naveen 2003). A large body of data has been collected,\nand the challenge ahead lies in identifying changes to a\nsite\u2019s baseline reference state and, if possible, determining\nwhether any detected changes are of naturally occurring or\nanthropogenic origin (Hofman & Jatko 2000). Trathan\net al. (in press) pointed out that it may never be possible to\ncompletely identify all of the many subtle influences that\nimpact upon the breeding numbers of gentoo penguins on\nGoudier Island, one of the most frequently visited tourist\nsites in Antarctica. De Villiers (2008) further concluded\nthat there is no \u201cone size fits all\u201d solution to managing\nhuman disturbance to wildlife in Antarctica. Not only are\nwildlife responses to human activity species-specific,\nactivity-specific and location-specific, in many cases it\nremains unclear if less than minor or transitory impacts,\ne.g. from pedestrian visits, can accumulate into more\nharmful outcomes for wildlife over longer periods (Holmes\net al. 2008). Long-term monitoring studies and targeted\nexperimental studies are needed to provide information in\ndetecting and managing potentially harmful human impacts\non wildlife. At the same time, the precautionary approach\nshould be applied with vigour with regard to the\nmanagement and the regulation of tourist numbers and\nproximity to colonies, as advocated by many studies (e.g.\nWheeler et al. 2008, Trathan et al. in press and references\ntherein).\nChemical and sewage contamination\nChemical and sewage contamination are treated generally\nunder the Environmental Protocol through its provisions\nfor the protection of the Antarctic environment, air and\nwater quality, and are dealt with more specifically under\nAnnex III to the Environmental Protocol, Waste Disposal\nand Waste Management and Annex IV, Prevention of\nMarine Pollution. Since the entry into force of the\nEnvironmental Protocol, sewage treatment has become\ncompulsory for research stations occupied by more than\n30 people. All open burning of wastes has ceased. The\nintroduction of pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls\n(PCBs) and polystyrene packaging into the Antarctic\nTreaty area have been prohibited.\nIn the ten years since the entry into force of the\nEnvironmental Protocol, there has been relatively little\nprogress in implementation of the provision requiring all\npast and present waste disposal sites on land and\nabandoned sites of Antarctic activities to be cleaned up by\nthe generator(s) of such wastes and the user(s) of such sites\n(in Annex III). This requirement opens up a number of\nsignificant issues for managers of national programs, or\nother polluters, as it applies retrospectively to a large\nlegacy of waste, perhaps including of the order 1\u201310\nmillion m3 of contaminated soils and sediments (Snape\net al. 2001b). Furthermore, it does not establish to what\nlevel sites should be cleaned-up, does not address\nliabilities, policing, penalties or a mechanism for recovery\nof damages, and does not specify what type of monitoring\nis required to demonstrate that any activity does not result\nin adverse environmental impacts.\nOver the past decade, a number of countries have undertaken\nsite clean-ups to removewastedumpsanddisused infrastructure\nleft over from past activities. Examples include the United\nKingdom\u2019s removal of the waste dump site at Fossil Bluff\nand disused stations along the Peninsula, and the clean-up\noperations at Syowa (Japan) and Marambio (Argentina)\nstations as well as at ECARE (Uruguay) and the abandoned\nCape Hallet station (New Zealand, USA). Most clean-ups\nHUMAN IMPACTS REVIEW 23\nhave largely involved the bulk removal of surface rubbishwhile\nfew have undertaken full remediation of contaminated soils and\nsediments (Crumrine 1992, Kohnen&Lukin 1998, COMNAP\n2007). The complete remediation of World Park Base by\nGreenpeace in the early 1990s (Roura 2004) and the partial\nclean-up at Casey Station in 2003\u201304 (Stark et al. 2006) are\nexamples of the latter type of activity. One reason for the lack\nof implementation of the remediation provision is that no\nuniversally accepted standards exist, and neither is there any\nenvironmental protection authority insisting that sites be\nrehabilitated. Another reason is cost. Remediation costs are\ntypically ten times greater than in temperate developed\ncountries, and many low-cost technologies, such as\nbioremediation, are yet to be proven in Antarctica. However,\nwhen Annex VI to the Environmental Protocol, Liability\nArising from Environmental Emergencies, enters into force\nall Antarctic operators will have the legal responsibility for\nthe clean up or the cost of the clean up after any accidental\nevent that leads to significant and harmful impact to the\nAntarctic environment. Signed in 2005 and still to be ratified\nby all ATCPs, Annex VI could possibly force the issue of\nremediation to be considered in earnest.\nFilling the gaps in science-based environmental\nmanagement\nThrough the work of the Scientific Committee to CCAMLR,\nSCAR and the Committee on Environmental Protection to\nthe Antarctic Treaty Parties, science-based environmental\nmanagement has become part of the core of the ATS. As\ndemonstrated in this review, research on human impacts\ncan be used to inform environmental management\ndecisions which can, in turn, enhance the minimization\nand mitigation of these impacts, forming a feedback\nmechanism. Gaps, however, still exist in this process. If\naspects can be fulfilled, the robustness of science-based\nenvironmental management in Antarctica will be\neffectively enhanced.\nMost of the research on the impacts of human activities on\nthe Antarctic environment is focussed on relatively small\nareas and in single disciplines. Human impacts on a\nregional or continental scale are rarely examined, making it\ndifficult to have an overview of the scale of human impacts\nor to be able to provide information on the effectiveness\nof multi-disciplinary management regimes, such as\nenvironmental impact assessments (EIAs). The requirement\nfor an EIA for every activity prior to its commencement is\none of the most important elements of the Environmental\nProtocol. Under Annex I to the Protocol, Environmental\nImpact Assessment, three levels of assessments are defined \u2013\nPreliminary Assessment (PA), Initial Environmental\nEvaluation (IEE) and Comprehensive Environmental\nEvaluation (CEE) - to be applied to activities with different\nprobable levels of impacts. In the assessment, the impacts\nof the proposed activity are predicted and assessed, and\nthis information is used to inform the decision as to\nwhether a proposed activity should proceed, and if so,\nwhether in its original or modified form. Clearly, the\neffectiveness and credibility of the EIA process has a\nsignificant bearing on the magnitude and extent of the\nenvironmental impacts that are the subject of the present\npaper. A number of studies have highlighted concerns with\nthe implementation of the EIA provisions: impacts\npredicted in the EIAs are seldom followed up and verified,\nEIAs only apply to individual activities, and do not address\nrisks caused by the sum of operations, and the multiple\nfacets of tourism are not addressed fully in IEEs and have\nnot been addressed in any CEEs (Kriwoken & Rootes\n2000, Hemmings & Roura 2003, Bastmeijer & Roura\n2007). Current research on human impacts rarely provides\nthe information required to assess and verify environmental\nimpacts predicted in EIAs. Consequently no data can be\nfed back to assess the effectiveness of EIA provisions. As\nthe sole gatekeeper of whether an activity can or cannot go\nahead in Antarctica, the EIA process needs to be informed\nand tuned by more robust checks and balances, especially\nin view of the expansion of both national and commercial\nactivities in Antarctica.\nEnvironmental monitoring is seen as integral to the EIA\nprocess (NSF\/COMNAP\/SCAR 2005) under Annex 1 of\nthe Environmental Protocol, and is considered as an\nimportant activity within the Protocol for assessing,\nunderstanding and managing human impacts in Antarctica.\nHowever, this effort, which is crucial to the verification of\npredicted impacts and the early detection of unforeseen\neffects of activities, has been under-deployed. Despite\nsome monitoring initiatives by individual nations and\ngroups of nations, there is still an overriding need for\noverall coordination of monitoring activities in Antarctica.\nA small number of baseline studies have been set up in\nvegetation communities around Antarctic stations with the\nintent of providing monitoring data for future changes\n(Thor 1997 and references therein, Hee et al. 2007). Co-\nordinated and effective monitoring programs of impacts on\nvegetation and ecosystems more widely are still needed\n(ASOC 2004, Frenot et al. 2005, 2007). The Long Term\nEcological Research (LTER) programmes set up in the\nMcMurdo Dry Valleys and off Anvers Island are\nexemplary in gathering process and baseline data on the\nbiota in order to serve as a context for any observed\nchanges. Few sewage outfalls have a comprehensive\nmonitoring program in place despite research showing that\nsewage released from both large and small research stations\nmay have significant cumulative environmental impacts.\nGiven that there are 53 active Antarctic stations (with\nsome form of treatment attempted by around 50%),\nsurprisingly few studies investigating the extent of sewage\nimpacts are publicly available (Gro\u00a8ndahl et al. 2008).\nLong-term monitoring data is essential for informing future\ndecisions on 1) appropriate types and degrees of sewage\nT. TIN et al.24\ntreatment, 2) the design and siting of outfalls, and 3) likely\nimpacts of sewage disposal on Antarctic wildlife. Similarly,\nlong-term studies and targeted research are needed to\nprovide information on which to base tourist management\ndecisions.\nNot all human impacts have been studied extensively, as is\nclear from the preceding discussion, severely hindering well-\ninformed, science-based environmental management. The\nimpacts of acoustics on marine mammals in the Southern\nOcean is one such example where SCAR (2006a) has\nrepeatedly highlighted the need of targeted research in\norder to provide a sound scientific basis to underpin any\nfuture management of ocean noise. Even less attention has\nbeen paid to the impacts of human activities on the\nintrinsic, wilderness and aesthetic values of Antarctica -\nvalues which are afforded protection under Article 3 of the\nEnvironmental Protocol. Again, the lack of research does\nnot necessarily reflect a lack of impacts. An individual\nhuman activity may have a relatively small direct impact on\nthe wilderness values of the immediate surroundings but, if\nit takes place far from existing centres of activity and\nwhere there have not yet been impacts by human activities,\nit will break up the integrity of the wilderness area and\nfragment it into smaller pieces, thereby significantly\neroding the key characteristics that make this wilderness\narea unique. According to Keys (1999), the area of\nwilderness in Antarctica is being diminished as a result of\nincreased accessibility to and within Antarctica, continued\ngrowth in numbers and size of stations, field camps and\ndepots, rapid increase in numbers of tourists, expansion of\nfisheries and increased commercialization of Antarctica.\nSummerson & Riddle (2000) state that Antarctic\nwilderness is being modified through activities or relics of\nformer activities that can be readily sensed by humans such\nas by sight or sound, as well as those that cannot be readily\nsensed, such as the area impacted by an oil spill,\nareas where radioactive isotopes have been used for\nbiological research, and dust plumes. According to\nHemmings (1997), aesthetic and wilderness values may be\nimpacted at differing scales, from the localized to the\ncircumpolar. Apart from these general appraisals, little\nwork has focussed on the consideration, monitoring,\nminimization or the management of impacts of human\nactivities on Antarctica\u2019s wilderness and aesthetic values\n(Bastmeijer & Roura 2007). Globally, wilderness\nprotection is not a novel concept; wilderness laws and\npolicies exist in 15 countries in both northern and southern\nhemispheres (Kormos 2008). They provide real-life\nexamples of protection of wilderness values, although their\nrelevance to the Antarctic context still needs to be\nexamined. Compared to the other human impacts that have\nbeen discussed in this review, it is evident that a lot more\nwork is still needed in order to adequately understand,\nmainstream and implement the protection of Antarctica\u2019s\nwilderness and aesthetic values.\nWhile there will always be an imperative for additional\nscience and information on which to base decisions,\nuncertainty is a basic and largely unavoidable aspect\nof environmental management in Antarctica. The\nprecautionary approach, which CCAMLR and other\ninternational environmental regimes have explicitly adopted\nand implemented to varying degrees, appears to be highly\nappropriate in the context of the environmental management\nof Antarctica. It promotes the anticipation, prevention and\nmitigation of threats to the environment. Complete certainty\nregarding an environmental harm should not be a\nprerequisite for taking action to avert it, and risks associated\nwith unsustainable practices in conditions of uncertainty are\nthereby minimized (Cooney & Dickson 2005). The aim of\nthe precautionary approach is to ensure that uncertainties\nabout the impacts of an activity are weighed in the decision-\nmaking process. Bastmeijer & Roura (2004) highlighted\nsome of the practical measures implied by application of the\nprecautionary principle to Antarctic tourism. These include:\nimproving the applicability of EIA to tourism, improving\nthe process of assessment of cumulative impacts prior to the\nactivity rather than expecting that monitoring during and\nafter the activity has taken place will provide all the\nanswers, adopting restrictions on the permissible types of\nactivities, and establishing temporal or spatial limitations for\ncertain sites as required by their specific values and\ncharacteristics. Indeed, most of these and other measures\nwould also be relevant where the precautionary approach is\napplied to environmental management in Antarctica and the\nSouthern Ocean. As a unique global commons, Antarctica,\nthe Southern Ocean and its environment continue to deserve\nthe highest level of protection. The environmental\nmanagement regimes of the Antarctic Treaty System have\noften been lauded as being innovative and forward-looking,\nsetting the example for other parts of the world. In the 21st\ncentury, it is necessary for these regimes to continue to\nevolve and deliver bold and forward-looking solutions to\nthe new environmental challenges facing the Antarctic region.\nConclusions\nBargagli (2005) concluded that \u201calthough scientific research\nin Antarctica is of paramount importance in addressing\nclimatic and environmental challenges, there is no doubt\nthat the value of Antarctica for science should be weighed\nagainst the environmental impact of scientific work and its\nlogistic support.\u201d We contend that this philosophical\napproach should be applied to all human activities in\nAntarctica, regardless of the nature of the activity. Any\nhuman visit carries with it a risk of ecosystem disturbance\nand of the introduction of new non-indigenous species. The\nsurvival of any human necessitates the use of fuels and\nconstruction materials, the production of wastes and\ninteractions with flora and fauna. Increased use of renewable\nenergy, optimization of logistics, removal of wastes, etc.,\nHUMAN IMPACTS REVIEW 25\ncertainly contribute towards reducing the impacts of human\nactivities in the Antarctic and the Southern Ocean. Yet,\nexploitation of marine resources, construction of\ninfrastructure, increased marine and air traffic and possible\naccidents and leaks undoubtedly leave imprints on the\nAntarctic environment. Unfortunately, Antarctica can no\nlonger be considered pristine, many impacts from human\nactivities are neither minor nor transitory, and some are\nirreversible. Over the past decade, CCAMLR and the\nEnvironmental Protocol have succeeded in reducing some\nenvironmental impacts of human activities on the Antarctic\nenvironment. In the coming decades, the effectiveness of\nthese regimes will be put to the test, in the face of the\ncontinuing increase in intensity and diversity of human\nactivities in Antarctica. Outside Antarctica, global\ninfluences, such as climate change and long-distance\npollution may act synergistically with local impacts, making\nmanagement even more difficult. Environmental monitoring\nand targeted research are urgently needed to inform\nmanagement decisions. At the same time, environmental\nmanagement need not be paralysed by the lack of data and\nshould instead, fully embrace the precautionary approach\nand deliver bold and forward-thinking solutions to the\nenvironmental challenges facing Antarctica in the 21st\ncentury. The preservation of the Antarctic environment,\nincluding its unique intrinsic, wilderness and scientific\nvalues is a fundamental principle of the Antarctic Treaty,\nand to fail to do so at this juncture would be an indictment\nof the Antarctic community.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank Mark Belchier, Roberto\nBargagli, Yan Ropert-Coudert, Marienne de Villiers,\nVirginia Gascon, Katja Heinke, Alan Hemmings, Nick\nHolmes, Hans-Ulrich Peter, Richard Philips, Ricardo\nRoura, Rupert Summerson, Claire Waluda, Barry Weeber,\nRodolfo Werner Kinkelin, the librarians at the Scott Polar\nResearch Institute, David Walton and three anonymous\nreviewers for their helpful comments and in the research of\nliterature.
