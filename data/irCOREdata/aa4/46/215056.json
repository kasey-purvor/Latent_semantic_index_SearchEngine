In parallel, there has been a mas-\nsive increase in access to microdata which has \nrevealed huge dispersions in productivity. For \nexample, within narrow industries like cement, \noak flooring, and block-ice the total factor pro-\nductivity of plants at the ninetieth percentile is \nabout twice that of those at the tenth percen-\ntile (Lucia Foster, John Haltiwanger, and Chad \nSyversson 2008).\nUnfortunately, analyzing to what extent this \nheterogeneity in productivity is due to manage-\nment and organizational practices, unmeasured \ninputs, or other technologies has been held back \nby a lack of data. National statistical agencies \ndo not usually collect data on the internal orga-\nnization of companies, nor do firms report this \nin their accounts. Recently, however, social \nscientists have been starting to fill this gap by \nworking closely with small numbers of indi-\nvidual firms (e.g., the \u201cInsider Econometrics\u201d \napproach described in Kathryn Shaw 2009) \nor covering wide cross-sections of firms (e.g., \nNicholas Bloom, Raffaella Sadun, and John Van \nReenen 2009). In this paper we describe some \nof the tools of this research, particularly Bloom \nand Van Reenen (2007)\u2014henceforth BVR\u2014\nfor measuring management and organizational \npractices.1\n1 Further material can be found online at: http:\/\/cep.\nlse.ac.uk\/_new\/research\/productivity\/management.asp and \nhttp:\/\/www.stanford.edu\/~nbloom\/index_files\/Page371.htm.\nNew Approaches to Surveying Organizations\nBy Nicholas Bloom and John Van Reenen*\nI.\u2002 Minimizing\u2002Survey\u2002Bias\nA key challenge in surveys is to obtain unbi-\nased responses to questions. Here we outline a \nseries of steps we have found useful, first con-\ncentrating on reducing the bias of the respond-\nent (the manager) and then on reducing the bias \nof the interviewer (typically an MBA student).\nA. Reducing Respondent Bias\nChoosing Appropriate Respondents.\u2014It is \nimportant to survey somebody junior enough \nto know day-to-day practices but senior enough \nto take an overall view of the organization. For \nexample, we targeted plant managers in manu-\nfacturing, service line managers in hospitals, \nprincipals in schools, and district managers in \nretail. In manufacturing we phoned firms and \nrequested to speak to plant managers, and if \nno one fitted that definition we asked for \u201cthe \nperson in charge of production at the factory.\u201d \nIt can also be useful to obtain responses from \nemployees in different levels of the firm\u2019s hier-\narchy to see if there is some systematic differ-\nence in response.\nResponder Blind Surveys.\u2014There is ample \nevidence in the psychology literature that \nrespondents like to give the answers that they \nbelieve the interviewer wants to hear. For exam-\nple, Norbert Schwartz (1999) asked experimen-\ntal subjects to discuss newspaper stories about \nmass murderers. One group was given paper \nwith the letterhead \u201cInstitute of Personality \nResearch\u201d while the other group was given \npaper with the letterhead \u201cInstitute of Social \nResearch.\u201d The former group\u2019s responses con-\ncentrated much more on personality and the \nlatter on social environment, highlighting \nrespondents\u2019 desire to provide answers they \nbelieve the researcher wants to hear. Thus, in \nBVR managers were not told in advance they \nwere being scored against a grid of manage-\nment practices. Instead they were simply told \nthey were being interviewed by a graduate \n* Bloom: Department of Economics, Stanford \nUniversity, 578 Serra Mall, CA 94350 and CEP and NBER \n(e-mail: nbloom@stanford.edu); Van Reenen: Department \nof Economics, London School of Economics, Houghton \nStreet, London, WC2A 2AE and CEP, CEPR and NBER \n(e-mail: j.vanreenen@lse.ac.uk).

For example, \nto score firms on promotion systems the inter-\nviewer would start by asking \u201cTell me about \nyour promotion system,\u201d followed by \u201cHow \ndo you identify and develop top performers?\u201d, \n\u201cHow are decisions made about promotions?\u201d, \nand \u201cCan you describe the most recent promo-\ntion round?\u201d The collected responses to these \nquestions would be scored against a grid ranging \nfrom one for \u201cPeople are promoted primarily on \nthe basis of tenure (years of service)\u201d to five for \n\u201cTop performers are actively identified, devel-\noped and promoted.\u201d In contrast the question \n\u201cDo you actively identify, develop and promote \nyour top performers?\u201d [Yes\/No] is more leading \nin that it implies this is a standard practice, so \nthat many firms may (falsely) respond positively.\nAbsolute Rather than Subjective Scales.\u2014\nMany survey forms offer subjective scales for \nresponses, commonly known as \u201cLikert\u201d scales. \nFor example, a question like \u201cHow good is your \nfirm\u2019s performance tracking?\u201d with response \nchoices \u201cExtremely good,\u201d \u201cGood,\u201d \u201cAverage,\u201d \n\u201cPoor,\u201d and \u201cVery poor\u201d is subjective because \n\u201cPoor\u201d means different things to different \npeople. A manager who previously worked for \nHonda may view daily production monitoring \nas \u201cPoor\u201d (Honda has real time monitoring), \nwhile a manager having previously worked in \nan Indian textile firm may view daily monitor-\ning as \u201cExtremely good\u201d (Indian textile firms \n2 This raises ethical issues, but Human Subjects \nCommittees have accepted this approach is appropriate \nsince it is: (i) necessary to get accurate responses, (ii) mini-\nmized to sensitive questions and is temporary (i.e., manag-\ners are informed afterwards), and (iii) presents no risk as \nthe data is kept confidential.\noften have no formalized monitoring). Since \nthese responses are not even comparable across \nrespondents, they are certainly not compa-\nrable across firms. Using absolute responses \navoids this problem\u2014for example asking the \nquestion \u201cHow frequently do you track perfor-\nmance?\u201d with responses \u201cYearly,\u201d \u201cQuarterly,\u201d \n\u201cMonthly,\u201d \u201cWeekly,\u201d \u201cDaily,\u201d \u201cRepeatedly \nwithin each day.\u201d\nAsking for Examples.\u2014We have found exam-\nples are particularly helpful for topics which are \nsensitive within firms and where practice often \ndiffers from theory. For example, most organi-\nzations in theory have a process for getting rid \nof underperforming employees, but in practice \nthis rarely happens in many organizations (e.g., \nthe public sector). So we found it was essential \nafter the initial question \u201cIf you had a poor per-\nformer what would you do?\u201d to follow up with \n\u201cCould you give me a recent example?\u201d\nControlling for Respondent Characteristics.\u2014\nDifferent interviewees may respond in different \nways to the same question. To address this we \ncollect detailed information on responders (e.g., \ntheir position in the hierarchy, tenure in the firm \nand tenure in their current post). This informa-\ntion can be useful by including these as noise \ncontrols in regression analysis. For example, in \nBVR we found that senior managers had higher \nmanagement scores, possibly because manage-\nment practices are better at senior levels of the \nfirm or possibly because senior managers are \nmore positive about their firms. Either way, \ncontrolling for these variables in the regres-\nsion analysis usually helps reduce measurement \nerror.\nB. Reducing Interviewer Bias\nInterviewer Blind Survey.\u2014Biases may be \ndue to the interviewer\u2019s having preconceptions \nabout the firm being questioned. For example, \nan MBA student interviewing a General Electric \nplant is likely to be ex ante prejudiced in giv-\ning the firm a high score on its management \npractices. We tried to mitigate this by choosing \nmedium sized firms (100 to 5,000 employees) \nwhich the interviewers were unlikely to have \npreviously heard of. We also did not share any \nfinancial information on the firms in advance: \ninterviewers were provided only with the firm\u2019s \nVOL. 100 NO. 2 107NEw APPROAChES tO SuRVEYING ORGANIzAtIONS\nname, telephone number, and industry before \nthe interview. In particular, they were not pro-\nvided with any prior performance data and did \nnot research their firms on the Internet before \ncalling them. This meant the interview had to \nbegin with the question \u201cCould I start by asking \nyou a bit about what you do in your firm?\u201d If \ninterviewers were challenged over their lack of \nprior knowledge of the firm they explained, \u201cWe \ndeliberately do not research firms in advance to \nmake sure we have no preconceptions before \nrunning interviews,\u201d which seemed to satisfy \nmost managers.\nCalibrate Early, Calibrate Often.\u2014When \nmoving away from a single script with closed \nquestions to a more complex script with open \nquestions the concern arises that interviewers \nwill be scoring answers in subtly different ways. \nTo mitigate this problem it is important to have \nintensive training prior to the survey to explain \nthe scoring grid. For example, we ran several \ndays of lean manufacturing, target setting and \nperformance management training sessions in \nthe initial training week for BVR. We also ran \na series of calibration exercises to ensure con-\nsistent scoring. This involved a lead researcher \nrunning mock interviews which all the trainee \ninterviewers scored individually and then dis-\ncussed together as a group to align scoring. \nThroughout the survey process we continued to \nrun these mock-interviews to ensure calibration \nwas maintained.\nCommon Location with Cross Group \nInterviewing.\u2014To compare different subjects \ngroups\u2014for example different countries\u2014it is \nuseful to base the interview team in one loca-\ntion and rotate interviewers across groups. \nRotation across groups means that interviewer \nfixed effects can be removed when making \ncomparisons. For example, if Ron and Pierre \nare interviewing the United States and France \nrespectively using field based surveys (i.e., vis-\niting the firms in person), then the difference \nbetween the scores could be due either to real \ndifferences in management practices or to dif-\nferences in the interview approach of Ron and \nPierre. Instead, if they are both running the \nsurvey from the United Kingdom by telephone, \nundertaking regular calibration, and switch \ncountries throughout the survey (because Ron \nspeaks French and Pierre speaks English), then \ndifferences between countries should be more \ninformative of management differences. This \nis a substantial practical advantage of telephone \nbased surveys, in that it enables interviewers \nto rotate between organizations from different \nlocations.\nInterviewer Quality.\u2014Open questions with \nabsolute scoring grids put demands on the abil-\nity of interviewers. Thus, the human capital of \nthe interviewers is important\u2014for example, \ninterviewers need to be able to rapidly under-\nstand a range of modern management practices \nin training and ideally have some prior business \nexperience (as well as having language skills!). \nThis is especially important if the target respon-\ndents are senior managers, such as plant man-\nagers, who can give short shrift to people they \nthink do not know what they are talking about. \nSo, we usually hire international MBA students \nfrom good schools as interviewers.\nIncentives and Monitoring.\u2014Personnel eco-\nnomics emphasizes the importance of the right \nkind of incentive pay contracts. In early survey \nwaves we paid interviewers flat-rate salaries, \nusing personal encouragement to persuade them \nto make calls. However, since scheduling and run-\nning interviews is hard and repetitive, we found \nflat rate salaries led to only moderate levels of \nproductivity. So in later survey waves we moved \nto piece rate pay for interviewers, with a super-\nvisor for each group of four interviewers. The \nsupervisors did not run interviewers, but instead \nthey silently listened in to the interviews to ensure \nquality control. Supervisors were paid a flat rate \nsalary and were usually part of the research team \nor a trusted PhD student. While this change led \nto a 20 percent drop in interview manpower (one \nof out every five people became a supervisor) we \nobtained a doubling in productivity.\nC. Reducing Interview Bias\nThe context of the interview itself can cause \na bias\u2014for example, Daniel Kahnemann et al. (2004) report how happiness varies with the \ntime of day. So it is helpful to record the time of \nthe day (for the interviewee and the respondent), \nthe day of the week, and the interview dura-\ntion as factors and control for these in regres-\nsion analysis. For example, in BVR we found \nthat responders were more likely to give higher \nMAY 2010108 AEA PAPERS AND PROCEEDINGS\nresponses in the morning and towards the end \nof the week. We also realized that interviewers \ncould evaluate the quality of an interview\u2014for \nexample, some respondents were very forth-\ncoming with information and knowledgeable \nabout their firm, while others were guarded and \nless informed. So we asked interviewers to score \nthe perceived reliability of the interview score. \nThis turned out to be valuable, because in inter-\nviews with higher reliability scores the man-\nagement practices scores were more strongly \ncorrelated with firm performance, suggesting \nself-assessed interview quality can proxy for \ninterview quality.\nD. Getting People to Respond\nThe surveys we have conducted are volun-\ntary, and we often are asked \u201cwhy do people \nrespond to your survey?\u201d Of course, one could \nask this of almost any voluntary survey (e.g., the \nCurrent Population Survey), but it is more likely \nto be an issue because researcher\u2019s surveys are \nnot directly government supported. Our experi-\nence is once you get respondents talking on the \nphone they usually like to talk about themselves \nand their jobs. The hardest part is getting an \ninterview scheduled in the first place. Several \nstrategies can help. First, firms are inundated \nby marketing research, so switchboards refuse \nto connect calls from people wanting to conduct \n\u201csurveys\u201d or mentioning \u201cresearch\u201d (because of \nthe link to market research). We found it was \nbest to confidently ask to be connected to the \nproduction manager, and, if questioned, state we \nwere \u201cdoing a piece of work on manufacturing \nmanagement.\u201d Our interviewers tried to avoid \never using the word \u201csurvey\u201d or \u201cresearch.\u201d\nSecond, try to obtain some endorsement \nfor your study from an official body\u2014like the \nCentral Bank\u2014to distinguish what you are \ndoing from marketing companies. Third, per-\nsistence is a virtue. Responders will frequently \nprocrastinate and miss the scheduled time for \ninterviews. It is necessary to persistently fol-\nlow up, which requires running the survey over \nseveral months. Also phoning outside regular \nbusiness hours is helpful\u2014in the United States \nin particular many managers will pick up their \nphones to an unknown caller ID only outside the \nworking day.\nFourth, avoid asking for information that \ncan be obtained from other sources. Financial \n information can be sensitive and is often pub-\nlicly available anyway in company accounts. \nHaving the respondent obtain this data wastes \nvaluable interview time. Finally, open ended \nquestions like \u201cTell me about your promotion \nsystem\u201d are more engaging than closed ended \nfactual questions like \u201cHow many people were \npromoted in your firm last year?\u201d Open ended \nquestions feel more like a conversation, while \nclosed ended questions feel like a dry data \nextraction. In BSV we minimized the time on \nclosed ended questions and located these at the \nend of the interview.\nIn BVR we obtained a 54 percent completed \ninterview response rate, which is extremely high \nby the standards of large-scale surveys which \nare not government mandated. Interestingly, \nwe also found that response rates were uncor-\nrelated with observables like firm performance, \nsuggesting more individualistic reasons for \nnonresponse.\nII.\u2002 Evaluating\u2002Survey\u2002Bias\nThe previous section outlined a number of \nsteps to minimize survey bias. But from our \nexperience of presenting organizational survey \nresearch it is also helpful to provide validation \nresults to convince the audience that the survey \nwas measuring real organizational differences \nacross firms. Below we outline a number of sur-\nvey exercises we have found useful for this.\nResponse Bias.\u2014After collecting survey \ndata it is important to evaluate response reli-\nability. One way is to compare the observable \ncharacteristics of the responders to the non-\nresponders, and for this one needs variables that \nare in both samples (i.e., not variables collected \nas part of the survey). For firms this typically \nincludes location, industry, size and accounting \ninformation.\nIndependent Resurvey tests.\u2014It is a good \nidea to resurvey about five percent of the firms \nusing different interviewers and responders. \nThis can be used to gauge the extent of measure-\nment error at the question level. For example, in \nBVR we resurveyed 64 firms using a different \ninterviewer to survey a different plant manager \nin the same firm to obtain two independent \nsurveys from the same firm. We found that the \nquestion level scores were correlated at 0.502 \nVOL. 100 NO. 2 109NEw APPROAChES tO SuRVEYING ORGANIzAtIONS\nand the management average score at 0.734. \nThis indicated survey reliability and was useful \nfor convincing potential skeptics that the survey \nwas really measuring differences in manage-\nment practices across firms.\nDifferent Survey Instruments.\u2014Another \ngood design is to collect the data using more \nthan one instrument and compare the results \nacross the methods. For example, Grous (2009) \nimplemented the BVR approach for UK aero-\nspace firms asking the same questions to plant \nmanagers using a telephone based survey, and \nthen visited the factory and interviewed plant \nmanagers, shop-floor workers, CEOs and IT \nmanagers. He found a high degree of consis-\ntency between the responders\u2019 answers, suggest-\ning that the single interview of the plant manager \nwas a low cost method of eliciting this type of \ninformation. Bloom et al. (2009) interviewed \na set of Indian firms using the BSV methodol-\nogy and then had a management consulting firm \nindependently evaluate the practices of these \nfirms using factory visits, and again found a \nhigh degree of consistency. Finally, European \nBank of Reconstruction and Development (2009) organized a face to face survey using a \nclosed-question paper based instrument on 418 \nUK, German, Indian and Polish firms that had \npreviously been interviewed using the BVR \nmethodology. Again, these responses were well \ncorrelated across the different survey tools.\nIII.\u2002 Conclusions\nWe have described some practical strategies \nfor economists who want to conduct surveys on \norganizational practices. These involve using \ndouble-blind survey techniques, with open \nended questions against absolute scoring grids, \nwhile also collecting background controls for \npotential survey bias. We also suggested the \nresurvey of a five percent sample of the original \ngroup using different interviewers and respon-\ndents within the same organizations to help to \nvalidate the methodology. The exact methodol-\nogy will rest on the research question at hand, \nbut we believe most of these steps should be \nadopted by researchers aiming to run high qual-\nity organizational surveys.\nMethodologically, what we are trying to do is \nsomewhere between the traditional approach of \neconomists generating and using large-sample \nsecondary data and the approach of qualitative \nsocial scientists using a case study approach. \nFor the types of questions in a range of research \nareas like personnel economics, organizational \neconomics, and contract theory we believe this \nmethodology has major advantages over more \nstandard approaches.\nREFERENCES\nBloom,\u2002 Nicholas,\u2002 and\u2002 John\u2002 Van\u2002 Reenen.\u2002 2007. \n\u201cMeasuring and Explaining Management \nPractices across Firms and Countries.\u201d Quar-\nterly Journal of Economics, 122(4): 1351\u20131408.\nBloom,\u2002Nicholas,\u2002Raffaella\u2002Sadun,\u2002and\u2002John\u2002Van\u2002\nReenen.\u2002 2009. \u201cThe Organization of Firms \nacross Countries.\u201d National Bureau of Eco-\nnomic Research Working Paper 15129.\nBloom,\u2002Nicholas,\u2002 Benn\u2002Eifert,\u2002Aprajit\u2002Mahajan,\u2002\nDavid\u2002 McKenzie,\u2002 and\u2002 John\u2002 Roberts.\u2002 2009. \n\u201cDoes Management Matter: Evidence from \nIndia.\u201d Unpublished.\nEuropean\u2002Bank\u2002for\u2002Reconstruction\u2002and\u2002Develop-\nment.\u20022009. transition Report 2009: transi-\ntion in Crisis?
