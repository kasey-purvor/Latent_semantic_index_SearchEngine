The reasons \nfor the lack of attention to the Chairman\/CEO dyad are highlighted, as well as the board \nand organisational performance reasons for maintaining role separation or entering into \nduality.  Due to the poverty of understanding the effect of the Chairman\/CEO \nrelationship, a qualitative study was undertaken from which four themes emerged \u2013 \nChairman\u2019s role and contribution, nature of the Chair\/CEO relationship, impact of the \nChair\/CEO relationship on board effectiveness, and the attributes of an effective \nChairman.  It is concluded that formative context is a determining factor in the \ndevelopment of this fundamental relationship which, in turn, has a profound impact on \nboardroom effectiveness. \nKey words:  Chairman role, Chairman contribution, Chairman-CEO relationship, \nBoard performance, Board effectiveness, sacred. \n \nIntroduction \nWhilst the relationship between the Chairman and the CEO has been acknowledged \nboth in theoretical treatise (Burton, 2000) and through empirical studies (Ng and De \nCock, 2002) as an important variable for attaining effective board performance, most \nstudies stop short of entering into in-depth analysis identifying the critical components \nwhich determine the nature of this dyadic interaction. Attention to the interpersonal \nChairman & CEO \n11\/04\/2006 \n2\ncharacteristics of the Chairman\/CEO and Chairman and board relationships has been \nsparse but some progress is being made in the area of SME boards (Burton, 2000). Yet, \nlack of research into the Chairman-CEO interaction is at odds when juxtaposed against \nthe considerable and growing interest for empirical study in the area of corporate \ngovernance, board performance and assessment, non executive directors\u2019 (NEDs) role \nand contribution, and the organisation\u2019s contribution to social capital. \n \nA four fold explanation is provided as to why the Chairman\/CEO interaction has not \nbeen given greater attention at a time when the performance of boards is under intense \nscrutiny. First, a historical legacy of agency theory and rationalist models of \norganisational functioning, particularly dominating the field of corporate governance, \nhas positioned intra-organisational top management relationships as an \u2018unrequired\u2019 \narea of study (Westphal, 1998). The perspective from the past has been: design the \norganisation according to enterprise strategy and the remainder is \u2018noise\u2019 (Kakabadse \nand Kakabadse, 2004). Second, the corporate governance literature is still dominated by \nUS based research where the roles of Chairman and CEO are mostly entrusted to the \nsame person - the \"President leader\" (Johnson et al, 1996). Even with the passing of the \nSarbannes-Oxley Act (2002) addressing corporate and director transgressions, still \nminimal interest is given to Chairman\/CEO\/President role, contribution and \ncapabilities. Greater attention has and continues to focus on the role and contribution of \nthe \u2018top\u2019 leader (Johnson et al, 1996). Third, access difficulties have been and remain a \nsource of constraint in studying \"managerial elites\" (Pettigrew and McNulty, 1998). \nLimited access to observe directors\u2019 behaviour in the boardroom context has been noted \nby Kahl (1957: 10) who states that \u201cthose who sit amongst the mighty do not invite \nsociologists to watch them make the decisions about how to control the behaviours of \nChairman & CEO \n11\/04\/2006 \n3\nothers\u201d.  According to Daily et al (2003: 379), directors of US boards fear allowing \nexternal scrutiny of boardroom activities as that may increase their risk of being subject \nto shareholder lawsuits. Fourth, corporate studies have adopted a broader strategic and \nless behavioural interest, whilst studies of senior managerial work and behaviour have \nconcentrated upon individuals and their job roles rather than upon the relationship \nbetween job holders who work together (Stewart, 1991: 511). As the majority of studies \nconcentrate on the individual such as the CEO (Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 2004), or \ndue to recent emerging interest, the non-executive director (Pettigrew and McNulty, \n1998; Barratt et al, 2003), interpersonal boardroom dynamics and the ecological \ncontext of relationships remains as virgin territory. Despite some scholarly attention, \nstudies still remain \u2018one stage removed form the direct observation of boards in action\u2019 \n(Pettigrew and McNulty, 1998: 850). \n \nFor the reasons outlined, the emerging view is that boardroom and company \nperformance examination has tended to neglect contextual concerns (Barratt et al, \n2003). As a result, director and board performance effectiveness remains \nunderexamined as board structure and composition analysis cannot adequately explain \nthe variance of behaviour of board members (Pettigrew and McNulty, 1998).  For \nexample, NEDs who are recruited as truly independent (i.e. not employees of the firm \nand do not have business ties with the firm aside from their directorship) and who are \ninclined to behave in an independent manner, may be prevented from realising their \nindependence due to information asymmetry. Moreover, deference to authority \nconfounds the propensity by NEDs to exercise control over CEO decisions as current \npower dynamics may be influenced by past CEO dominance transactions (Pettigrew \nand McNulty, 1998). \nChairman & CEO \n11\/04\/2006 \n4\n \nThus, on the basis that the Chairman\/CEO interaction in particular, and board \nperformance in general,  can only be understood within the formative context of each \nparticular enterprise (Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 2004), this paper presents the findings \nof an exploratory study of the Chairman\/CEO relationship and its impact on board \neffectiveness. Bearing in mind contextual considerations, role theory is used as the \nconceptual lens for this study. An overview of the relevant literature on dyadic \ninteractions precedes presentation of participants\u2019 experience and privately held views \nconcerning boardroom dynamics and the nature of Chairman\/CEO relationship.  It is \nconcluded that the Chairman\/CEO relationship is pivotal for effective boardroom \nperformance. \n \nChairman and CEO \nDyadic Analysis \nKatz and Kahn (1966) provided a three fold, psychologically-oriented framework for \nthe analysis of roles involving job holder activities and expectations, the expectations of \nothers of job holder behaviour and their reactions to such behaviour.  Others pursued \nrole-based functional analysis examining whether there exists a \u2018complementarity of \nfunctions\u2019 termed \u201crole constellation\u201d (Hodgson et al, 1965).  Further, Stewart (1991) \nexamined work sharing between district administrator and district nursing officer \ntermed \u201crole sharing\u201d. An additional functional orientation is the determination of \nexplicit and implicit role boundaries, termed \u2018boundary spanning\u2019, and the potential for \nclashes between roles spawning role conflict (Barratt et al, 2003).  It was Bartel (2001) \nwho brought together the psychological and functional orientation of role analysis \nthrough his study of individuals who regularly engage in boundary spanning activities, \nChairman & CEO \n11\/04\/2006 \n5\ni.e. interaction across the organisational boarders.  Bartel (2001) concluded that these \nindividuals need to be more psychologically flexible to maintain high levels of \nconfidence in their capacity to continually challenge and re-determine agreements and \ndelineations between their and others\u2019 activities and domains.  In this sense, board \ndirectors have been seen as boundary spanners serving as stakeholder representatives \nand guardians spanning issues such as corporate financial performance and corporate \nsocial performance (Barratt et al, 2003). \n \nAdditional to role as a determinant of the nature and quality of dyadic relationships, is \ncontext.  Hodgson et al\u2019s (1965) inquiry into role constellations concluded that where \nthe division of emotional labour between the CEO and other senior staff holds positive \nconnotations, a complementarity between senior managers can emerge forming a \nrelatively integrated whole (Table 1).  Stewart\u2019s (1991) demands, constants and choices \n(DCC) action-based inquiry model analysis of the relationship between Chairman and \ndistrict general managers (DGMs) in UK national health service (NHS) organisations \ndiscovered that Chairmen play a variety of roles that widely differ in nature due to the \nroles played by their DGMs.  Stewart (1991: 523) concluded that the roles of Chairman \nand DGM are mutely dependant, implying that their degree of dependency is \ncontextually determined (Table 1).  From such a base, and over the last decade, the \nimportance of context in understanding individual and boardroom interactions has been \nincreasingly acknowledged. The \u201cformative context\u201d within which a board and its \nmembers operate is likely to vary substantially, with each having their own specific \n\u201cpeculiarities\u201d (Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 2004). The complexity of organisational \n\u201cformative context\u201d, namely, institutional arrangements, cultural values, ethnic tastes, \nquality and nature of executive training, background and cognitive frames that shape \nChairman & CEO \n11\/04\/2006 \n6\nthe daily routines, ideology and objectives of individuals and their relational \nproximity\/interactivity, suggests that it is unwise that boardroom performance and its \ngovernance should be viewed as processual, control based routines. \n \nTable 1: Chairman\/CEO Dyad: Performance considerations \nAuthor Study Type Relationship for effective performance \nHodgson et \nal (1965) \nStudy of role \nconstellations. \n\u2022 Specialisation of various members complement and \nbalance; form a relative integrated whole. \n\u2022 Specialised\/differentiated roles should represent a modus \nvivendi that provides reward and a satisfying way of \nliving for CEO. \n\u2022 Sharing in executive teams provides for harmony of \ninteraction. \nKatz and \nKhan (1966) \nTheoretical treatise. \u2022 What individual job holders do is shaped by the \nexpectations that others have of their behaviour and the \nextent they recognise\/accept these expectations. \nRoe (1977) Interviews with \nbusiness leaders \nregarding changes in \ntheir roles. \n\u2022 Chairperson and CEO roles (when separated) vary \nacross organisations, dependent on: \n- Company structure; and \n- Personalities. \nChitayat \n(1984) \nInterviews with \nChairman and GMs in \nservice industry in \nIsrael.* \n\u2022 Chairman is Consultant and Coach to CEO. \nStewart \n(1991) \nLongitudinal study of \nrelationships between \nGMs and Chairmen. \nChairperson and CEO roles (when separated) vary across \norganisations depending on: \n\u2022 Company structure;  \n\u2022 Personalities; \n\u2022 Time Chairman gives to the role. \nConcludes that: \n\u2022 Chairman holds five roles in relation to DGM \n- Partner \n- Executive \n- Mentor \n- Consultant \n- Representative. \nCoombes \nand Wong \n(2004) \nSecondary data from \n350 FTSE companies in \nUK and S&P 500 \ncompanies in USA . \nIdentification of Chairman capabilities, include: \n\u2022 Time to devote to running the board. \n\u2022 Knowledge of the industry. \n\u2022 Willingness to play a behind-the-scenes role. \nChairman & CEO \n11\/04\/2006 \n7\n\u2022 Independent (i.e. not grey). \n\u2022 Served on the board for several years but not as CEO or \nexecutive at the same enterprise. \nSource: Compiled by the authors \n* GM \u2013 general manager \n \nDuality\/Separation Analysis \nIn Continental European and in UK enterprises, the separation of CEO and Chairman \npositions is now common practice (Dahya and Travlos, 2000), whereas role merger \npredominates US firms (Figure 1).  The reason role separation has taken on such \nimportance is that investors have concluded that enterprises are more stable and incur \nless risk over the long term if they resist domination by a single, all-powerful \nCEO\/Chairman (DGA, 2004). In addition, an emerging opinion amongst institutional \ninvestors is that the role of Chairman should be occupied by a non-executive director \n(DGA, 2004).  The two tier board system of governance driving Germany and the \nNetherlands requires role separation by law.  The supervisory board is comprised of and \nchaired by non-executives whilst the CEO (or equivalent) leads the management board. \n \nFigure 1: Percentage of Enterprises that have split Chairman and CEO role \n \n \nSource: Compiled from Dahya and Travlos (2000); DGA (2004); Coombes and Wong (2004) \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n1985 1989 1991 1993 1995 2003\nUK enterprises\nUS enterprises\nChairman & CEO \n11\/04\/2006 \n8\nIncreasingly, other countries are favouring Chairman\/CEO role separation.  The \nJohannesburg Security Exchange (JSE) requires listed companies to split the roles of \nChairman and CEO.  The splitting of CEO and Chairman is also adopted in Japan \n(DGA, 2004).  In France, although legislation allows for the split of roles, the prevalent \nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme structure where the \u201cpr\u00e9sident directeur-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral (PDG)\u201d (akin to \ncombined Chairman\/CEO) runs both the board and the company, remains as the \npreferred top executive configuration.  The Vi\u00e9not Committee examined this practice \nand concluded that boards have the option to divide the role or monitor the PDG \n(Vi\u00e9not, 1999). Recently, in the US, shareholder activists and the New York Stock \nExchange expressed preference for separating the roles of Chairman and CEO. \nHowever, such sentiments, nor the effect of corporate transgressions, have gained \nsufficient momentum to pressure US legislation to introduce role separation.  Just under \n20% of the Standard and Poor (S&P) 500 firms have divided the two top corporate \npositions (DGA, 2004; Coombes and Wong, 2004). The President\/CEO, being also the \nChairman of the board of US corporations, remains standard practice for the last 15 \nyears for 81% of enterprises (Coombes and Wong, 2004). \n \nThus, a particular momentum in favour of role separation has arisen from the corporate \ngovernance codes of countries outside the USA (DGA, 2004). In the UK, for example, \nthe Cadbury Committee was constituted to examine the lack of confidence in financial \nreporting by UK quoted companies.  Inadequate director accountability which was seen \nto lead to scandals such as the collapse of companies such as the Bank of Credit and \nCommerce International (BCCI), Polly Peck, Coloroll and Maxwell Publishing. After \nextensive consultation with interested parties, the Cadbury Committee recommended \nthat companies adopt governance structures and practices known as the Code of Best \nChairman & CEO \n11\/04\/2006 \n9\nPractice.  It was specifically recommended that the roles of Chairman and CEO be \nseparated (Cadbury, 1992). The Cadbury Committee considered the CEO role as a full-\ntime post, responsible and accountable for operational activities, the setting and \nimplementing of corporate strategy and ultimately for the performance of the company. \nIn contrast the Chairman was viewed as a part-time, independent position, responsible \nfor ensuring that the board works effectively (Cadbury, 1992). Accordingly, the \nChairman\u2019s role should involve monitoring and evaluating the performance of the \nexecutive directors, including that of the CEO, and as such should be distanced from \nday-to-day company operations, as well as attending to all boardroom affairs through, \nfor example, ensuring that non-executive directors have all relevant and necessary \ninformation for board meetings (Cadbury, 1992). The Cadbury Report was considerably \ninfluential in promoting a dual top executive role structure in UK firms, from 48.4% in \n1985, 90.2% in 1995 and 95% in 2003 (percentage of the FTSE 350 British firms; \nTable 2). \nChairman & CEO \n11\/04\/2006 \n10\n \nTable 2: Chairman\/CEO Role Separation (2003) \n \nCountry Separation of CEO and \nChairperson \n(listed companies) \n\u201cComply or explain\u201d \nprinciple (if role not \nseparated) \nLegal Requirement \nUK 95% Yes No \nUSA 18% N\/a No \nAustralia 90% Yes No \nCanada 65% Yes No \nBelgium 25% N\/a No \nFrance 20% N\/a No \nGermany 100% N\/a By definition   \n(i.e. two-tier board) \nNetherlands 100% N\/a By definition  \n(i.e. two-tier board) \nJapan 100% N\/a No \n(custom) \nRussia 100% N\/a Yes \nSouth Africa 100% N\/a No \n(JSE Security Exchange) \nSource: Compiled from Dahya and Travlos, (2000); Coombes and Wong (2004); DGA (2004) \n \nHowever, research on whether role separation improves corporate performance and\/or \ncorporate value has been contradictory and inconclusive.  Boyd (1995) found that \ncompanies that pursue role duality perform better than those with Chairman\/CEO role \nseparation. In contrast, Daily and Dalton (1994) position role duality as a sign of \nconcentrated CEO power which, combined with a lack of monitoring of board \ndecisions, has negative consequences for corporate performance.  Others, as Dalton et \nal (1998), indicate that duality has no effect on firm performance.  In contrast, and \nutilising similar performance measures, still others (Slatter and Lovett, 1999) found \nevidence in favour of splitting the roles of Chairman and CEO (Table 3). Whilst the \nambiguity of findings can be partly explained by the different research methodologies \napplied including sample size and the number of variables under investigation, other \nChairman & CEO \n11\/04\/2006 \n11\neffects often ignored in quantitative studies such as a corporate culture, ethical norms of \nbehaviour and the levels of honesty expected in business (Kakabadse and Kakabadse, \n2004), also determined this broad spectrum of conclusions. \n \nTable 3: Arguments For and Against Role Separation \nIssues Arguments for role separation Arguments against role separation \nChecks and \nBalances \nEssential for checking CEO power.

Boards are provided with a structural basis for \nacting independently through a dynamic boardroom culture which will allow the \nChairman and other board members to both challenge and counter balance the influence \nof the CEO (Coombes and Wong, 2004). \n \nThe Study \nDue to the relative poverty of inquiry pin-pointing the Chairman\/CEO relationship as \npivotal to effective board performance, a qualitative study examining the dyadic nature \nof this relationship, was undertaken.   The study aim was to reach understanding of \neach study participant\u2019s experience of the Chairman\/CEO relationship and its impact on \nChairman & CEO \n11\/04\/2006 \n12\nthe workings and performance of the board. Considerations of effectiveness of board \nperformance were derived from the perceptions of individual board members on the \nbasis that the relational element of effectiveness of performance could not be ignored. \nBeing an exploratory study, the privileged, insider information that some refer to as \n\u201cthe behind-closed-doors stuff\u201d (Coombes and Wong, 2004), \"black-box of boardroom \ndeliberation\" (Daily et al, 2003) or being privy to the \u201cinner sanctum\", or \"inner \nCabal\u201d, was obtained in part by observation of how the boards of four corporations \nfunctioned over a 26 month period and, in part, through one-to-one in-depth interviews \nwith individual board members, namely Chairmen, CEOs and NEDs.  The four boards \nwere of similar size (average 8 members) and structure (separation of Chairman and \nCEO roles). Given the networked nature of non executive directorships, each study \nparticipant drew on their experiences of a variety of role perspectives, such as \nChairman, CEO (who acted as a non-executive Chairman elsewhere or CEO \nelsewhere), or NED. Although 26 individuals participated in this study, at the time of \nthe study the respondents aggregately occupied 46 board roles.  One participant held an \nadditional five NED appointments. Twelve participants had experience beyond UK \nboards being NEDs on boards of multinational corporations.  Further, one of the four \nparticipating Chairmen held two additional Chairman roles. \n \nParticipants were asked to reflect on the way their board operates in terms of \neffectiveness, to describe events or incidents in the boardroom relating to the \nChairman\/CEO relationship, and to reflect on the nature of their role and contribution to \nthe board as well as on the role and contribution of other board members. The intention \nof the authors was to access personal, relational narratives.  Previous studies have \nshown that personal narratives can provide a rich source of data concerning the ways \nChairman & CEO \n11\/04\/2006 \n13\nindividuals frame social experiences in order to pursue inquiry of socially constructed \norganisational processes (Ng and De Cock, 2002). \n \nAll interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed thus collating detailed narratives \nfrom each respondent. These scripts were subsequently analysed and coded.  Emerging \nthemes and frameworks were amended in the light of the next transcription.  The \nanalysis involved \u201cgrounded\u201d theorizing, since through reflecting upon the meanings of \nrepeatedly used expressions such as \u201cintegrity\u201d, \u201ccohesion\u201d, \u201ctrust\u201d, it became possible \nto interpret the specificity and diversity of experiences. \n \nFindings \nFour themes emerged from analysis of interview data and observation of boardroom \ninteraction, namely: \n \n\u2022 Chairman\u2019s role and contribution; \n\u2022 Nature of the Chair\/CEO relationship; \n\u2022 Impact of the Chair\/CEO relationship on board effectiveness; and  \n\u2022 Attributes of an effective Chairman. \n \nChairman\u2019s Role and Contribution \nThe study participants consider that the role and contribution of the Chairman \nsubstantially differs from one company to the other, according to variance of context, \nprincipally company performance and the nature of critical decisions required.  \nDependent on the individual\u2019s skills of boundary spanning and degree of pro-activity in \npromoting clear communication, the study participants conclude an effective Chairman \nChairman & CEO \n11\/04\/2006 \n14\nto be one, who is sensitive to contextual demands and appropriately \u2018parallels parental \nambiguities in the sense of having to be supportive, protective and nurturing versus \nbeing disciplined and offering admonishment\u2019 (Chairman, Board 4). In delineating the \nthemes that emerged concerning the balancing of contrasting demands, three areas \ndetermining the Chairman\u2019s contribution to board effectiveness emerged, namely, \ncreating a platform for participation, respecting role delineation and managing \nboardroom dynamics. \n \nPlatform for Participation \nCreating the opportunity and environment for boardroom participation is reported as \nfundamental to enhancing board effectiveness.  Quality dialogue in terms of nurturing \n\u201cair space\u201d of a non-judgmental nature, where board members feel able to question \noperational concerns as well as the crafting of strategy, is perceived as crucial. The \nemergence of meaningful dialogue is attributed to the quality of the Chairman\/CEO \nrelationship. \n \n\u201cThe Chairman sets the tone in the board and his moral integrity \nestablishes the foundation for board effectiveness. Further, much of what \ngoes on in the boardroom depends on the Chairman\/CEO relationship.  It \nis these magic ingredients that makes a board effective or not.\u201d \n(NED 2, Board 1) \n \nA number of the study participants attributed the opportunity to openly discuss the \ncritical issues facing the company, a reduction of blocking tactics and greater exhibition \nof co-operative behaviour, as a reflection of the skills of the Chairman. \nChairman & CEO \n11\/04\/2006 \n15\n \n\u201cOverall, I think we are an effective board as we are moving slowly \nforward in the set direction without caving in to the market pressure for \nquick returns. Much of this is really board effectiveness as the Chairman \ncreates a safe haven and atmosphere, where we can sit and re-examine \neach  issue.\u201d \n(CEO, Board 1) \n \n\u201cIf, on balance, discussion around the table flows freely without \ndominance from any one person and all agenda items get sufficient air \ntime, you are in an effective boardroom.  It is my role to create that \nenvironment.  In a way, my role is to stabilise when things get out of kilter \nand to create a sense of synergy from multiple voices.  A lot of my energy \nand time is spent on creating right processes and the maintenance of \neffective relationships.\u201d \n(Chairman, Board 1) \n \nWhilst certain of the study participants more focused on the quality of the \nChairman\/CEO relationship and others considered that the skills of the Chairman \npromotes broad and open discussion, a third body of opinion highlighted that the \nChairman needs to be both bounded with and separated from, the CEO.  As establishing \na sound and positive interaction between the Chair and CEO was welcomed by all, \nequally however, the Chairman was reported as needing to address poor CEO \nperformance, and if necessary, dismiss the CEO. \n \nChairman & CEO \n11\/04\/2006 \n16\n\u201cIf I feel isolated then I have two choices. Stay and try to make it effective \nor leave. In the past I have exercised both choices, we had to go to the \nChairman in order to sack the CEO.\u201d \n(NED 4, Board 1) \n \nFrom the study participants\u2019 perspective, the challenge a Chairman faces is with whom \nto discuss the topic of a poor performing CEO.  Should the issue be brought to the \nboard\u2019s attention and discussed with the NEDs? \u2013 if yes, then the building of trust \nbetween the Chairman and the successor to the CEO could be undermined. \n \nRole Delineation \nThe study participants were almost unanimous in their opinion that the primary role of \nthe Chairman is to run the board, and that of the CEO to manage the company. \nHowever, numerous examples were offered that illustrated a contrasting scenario \nwhereby the Chairman was effectively driving the company forward or of an over \ndominant CEO controlling the Chairman. Whether respecting or not respecting of each \nother\u2019s role, the study participants concurred that the Chair\/CEO relationship had a \nmajor effect on boardroom dynamics. \n \n\u201cI\u2019ve experienced Chairmen who run the board and micro-manage the \nCEO, as well as the CEO who controls the board and the business. If the \nChairman\/CEO relationship is relatively balanced then you may have an \neffective board.\u201d \n(NED 1, Board 4) \n \nChairman & CEO \n11\/04\/2006 \n17\n\u201cA Chairman tends to be this sort of middle figure between the executives \nand the non executives.  If there is a little bit of trouble brewing, he is \nsomeone you can sit down with and close the door behind and say \u2026, so \nthat he can sort it out before next board meeting.\u201d \n(NED 3, Board 1) \n \nThe study participants recognised that the separate roles of Chairman and CEO, to a \ngreater extent, had clearly delineated activities and responsibilities.  However, elements \nof each role required clarification and negotiation between the Chairman and CEO.  \nTherefore, tensions between the two could be attributed both to the idiosyncrasies of \ntheir personal interaction and also to poorly delineated, peripheral responsibilities. \n \nDespite facing the frustration of unclear roles and the fact that certain Chairmen and \nCEOs do not respect each other, the majority of study participants considered the \ndelineation of roles to be a distinct advantage over North American practice. \n \n\u201cIn the American system you have the Chairman, President and CEO, \nhead chef, all in one guy \u2013 one executive and fifteen non executives and \nthat is not untypical. The Chairman\/President\/CEO comes before the non-\nexecutive committee and is basically explaining how he takes sole \nresponsibility.  He is the decision maker.  I think it is pity that Sarbannes-\nOxley did not address this issue.  Here, it is implicitly understood that the \nChairman leads the board and the CEO, the enterprise but, of course \nthere are many variations.\u201d \n(Chairman, Board 3) \nChairman & CEO \n11\/04\/2006 \n18\n \nBoardroom Dynamics \nEffectively managing the dynamics of the board was recognised by the study \nparticipants as a substantial challenge.  \u201cNo board is the same even though the \ncompanies may be in the same industry addressing similar issues.\u201d (NED 2, Board 4), \nwas a strongly held view.  The idiosyncratic nature of each board, determined on the \none hand by the operational and strategic issues facing the enterprise, and the \npersonalities and attitudes of the board members and their ways of interacting with each \nother, nurtures a unique dynamic.  Many of the study participants adopted the analogy \nof family dynamics to explain their boardroom experience. \n \n\u201cImagine that you have two grown up children who visit you for the family \ngatherings with their partners and that your new partner has a couple of \nchildren of their own who still live at home. As a parent, you manage these \nevents so that not only your children feel at home but also their partners \nand your partner\u2019s children, and above all that your partner is feeling \ncomfortable so that they all feel at ease and look forward to the next \nfamily event. Well that is my role on the board. I need to manage the grey \nand the independent NEDs, the executives and the CEO so that they want \nto talk to each other. If the CEO is mature then I worry less, but if, on the \nother hand, the CEO needs to grow up, then I have to work twice as hard \notherwise the NEDs will feel that they have to take sides and they will not \ntalk freely to each other.\u201d \n(Chairman, Board 4) \n \nChairman & CEO \n11\/04\/2006 \n19\nIt was clearly stated that the mindset, orientation and attitude of each board member \ncould not be taken for granted from one meeting to the next and, in so doing, the special \nskill of the Chairman was that of not making assumptions from one meeting to the next.  \nThe requirement is to create the \u2018space\u2019 to draw to the surface the diversity of views, \nfeelings and beliefs of each board member over particular issues. \n \n\u201cYes, we have good people on this board with business acumen and a \nwealth of experiences, but so do other boards. All the right skill mix, \nstructure, independence and other political correctness are wasted if there \nis no synergy. I think that what makes this board special is our Chairman. \nHe has a special quality in managing a platform for NED contribution.\u201d \n(NED 1, Board 2) \n \n\u201cOur boardroom is filled with high powered people. We all have a lot of \nexperience, influence and grit. Our egos can stand in the way and if the \nChairman can not synthesise our rows, energy and strengths, we would be \neither highly polarised or highly Machiavellian. Either way, we would be \ndysfunctional.\u201d \n(CEO, Board 2) \n \nIn providing opportunity for the NEDs to engage, the study participants confirmed that \nthe Chairman needs also to display that his relationship with the CEO is sufficiently \nrobust to withstand tenacious dialogue. \n \nChairman & CEO \n11\/04\/2006 \n20\n\u201cIn every boardroom, there are many powerful forces whether latent or \nactive. It is the Chairman\u2019s role to harness this power and transmit it to \nthe CEO, who then uses it outside the boardroom in the form of strategy \nand other market signals. And if you fail to harness this power into one \nvision, then the dreaded happens \u2013 the split within the board and next \nthing you know, share price is down and flailing.\u201d \n(Chairman, Board 2) \n \nHowever, the study participants were equally conscious of the inability of Chairmen to \nturn all tensions between board members into synergies and consistently manage the \ndynamics of the board. \n \nTheir mutual attachment (CEO and Finance Director) was neither \nacknowledged nor ignored \u2013 it was just there and the Chairman did not \nknow how to handle this massive energy that he created.  I guess we were \nall in their awe and we too added to the invincibility myth, the rest, the \nensuing collapse, you know \u2026\u2026\u201d \n(NED 3, Board 4) \n \n\u201cIf a couple of people create a special synergy and the Chairperson does \nnot manage it timely, even if inevitably these individuals\u2019 feelings may get \nslightly bruised, then the problem gets a life of its own.\u201d \n(CEO, Board 3) \n \nChairman & CEO \n11\/04\/2006 \n21\n\u201cYou can have all these talented and clever people on your board and they all \ncan be your friends or not, but if you cannot create a positive synergy between \nthem, then a negative one sets in and all is lost.  You will forever run around \npreventing disasters.\u201d \n(Chairman, Board 3) \n \nChairman\/CEO Relationship \nWhere the Chair\/CEO interrelationship was seen as working well, the study participants \nadopted terms such as \u2018mystical-like\u2019, \u2018special relationship\u2019, \u2018personal chemistry\u2019, \n\u2018shared philosophy\u2019.  The development of a close and personal affinity was reported by \na few as due to previous knowledge of each other possibly dating back to university \ndays, captured in the phrase \u2018old boys\u2019 network\u2019.  However, the critical reason for \nstrong ties was attributed to the ability of the Chairman and CEO to interpret \ninformation and events in a mutually synergistic manner, irrespective of their previous \nor current personal affiliation, or what other writers have termed as \u2018psychological \ncloseness\u2019 (Jones, 1995). \n \n\u201cThe Chairman should have no particular attachment to the CEO or \nsenior management. He should be truly independent but at the same time \nhe must share certain chemistry with the CEO, otherwise it will be a tense \nand even unworkable relationship. If they share affinity for each other \nbased on trust, respect or desire to succeed or learn from each other, then \nthey can create magic in a very special way. On the other hand, if their \nattractiveness is based on something else, such as complementary \nChairman & CEO \n11\/04\/2006 \n22\ndysfunctionality, than you may have a classic Butch and Sundance kid \ncombination. I\u2019ve seen both.\u201d \n(NED 3, Board 1) \n \n\u201cIt is a relationship of double helixes. Certain distance but then it must be \na meeting point. A very basic genetic imprint and if the genes are healthy \nthen you have an effective relationship and an effective board. In a way \nthat\u2019s what makes the relationship mystical.\u201d \n(CEO, Board 1) \n \nThe similarity of interpretation of circumstances and events between the Chair and the \nCEO was emphasised by the study participants as holding greater importance than \nsimilarity of beliefs and attitudes.  Equally, the lack of psychological closeness between \nthe two parties was interpreted by the participants as a distinct difference of \ninterpretation of events, partly attributed to personality distinctions, than differences of \nvision or desires for the future. \n \n\u2018I have a great respect for both. They handle their situation with great \ndignity and style. They are very different people to the extent that every \nsingle word, data and event is seen in a completely opposite direction. To \nput it bluntly, if you are to show them a picture of an orange, one will tell \nyou that is a grapefruit and other that is a lemon. The only commonality \nwould be that they are all citrus. \n(NED 2, Board 3) \n \nChairman & CEO \n11\/04\/2006 \n23\n\u201cThe Chair and I have relationship that is polite and that\u2019s really as far as \nit goes. On one occasion I nearly lost control and caused an almost \ncomplete breakdown in our relationship. I couldn\u2019t imagine the \nrelationship gaining greater value in the future.\u201d \n(CEO, Board 3) \n \n\u201cBasically we just get on and do the job. We do not have a relationship \noutside the boardroom. That\u2019s because we basically hold different \nphilosophies that rub each other up the wrong way, but we both play a \nstraight game with integrity and professional trust.  Generally he likes to \nget to a quick solution, because his interest is focused only on the financial \nside of business  - the bottom line, whilst I believe in this entire stuff about \ntriple bottom line. Saying that, we both share a common interest - a \ngenuine success for this organisation.\u201d \n(Chairman, Board 3) \n \nChairman & CEO \n11\/04\/2006 \n24\nImpact on Board Effectiveness \nThe study participants also acknowledge that the Chairman is not solely responsible for \nthe nurture of the \u2018magic relationship\u2019.  The CEO\u2019s contribution is equally important.  \nProfessional integrity and trust emerge as salient attributes of the Chair\/CEO \ninterrelationship effect on board performance.  \u201cEven with the most vigilant Chairman \non the board, if a CEO is not open and trustworthy, he can ruin the company between \nboard meetings.\u201d (NED 4, Board 2). \n \nIt was also stated that effective boards need quality information from executive \nmanagement, \u201cNot all information but quality and timely information and, if the CEO \ndoes not share the right information with a board, we are all out of the loop thus \nmaking it only the CEO\u2019s show.\u201d (NED 3, Board 1). Thus, a balanced exchange of \ninformation supported by relationships that are supportive of both the Chair and the \nCEO were considered as substantially contributing to board effectiveness. \n \n\u201cYou can say that I have a personal relationship with the Chairman, but \non this board everyone has. All our relationships are rather personal. It\u2019s \nbecause of the way that relationships have evolved under his \nChairmanship. There\u2019s always a business reason for the conversation or \nthe meeting, lunch or whatever it might be. He is somebody who works \nthrough on personal relationships. I respond to his needs rather than my \nown. Having said that, it\u2019s easier \u2018getting personal\u2019 with him than with \nsome members of my team. We both really understand each other even in \na silent way which is great at meetings.\u201d \n(CEO, Board 4) \nChairman & CEO \n11\/04\/2006 \n25\nCertain of the study participants offered a contrasting view of board effectiveness, \nnamely as one of prevention of dysfunctional tensions arising due to the sound nature \nof the Chairman\/CEO relationship, as opposed to that of working towards developing a \npositive dynamism in the boardroom. \n \n\u201cGood boardroom relationships are an asset, but in themselves do not \nguarantee success. But on the other hand, having poor relationships and \nin particular between Chairman and CEO guarantees problems. These \nmay vary in degree and intensity from subtle nuances, not getting the best \nfrom the NEDs to antagonistic and defensive behaviours, discomfort and \nanxieties and in general poor decision-making which consequently may \nlead to low confidence of key investors and ultimately poor share \nperformance.\u201d \n(NED 2, Board 4) \n \nAttributes of an Effective Chairman \nRecent studies highlight that the ideal Chairman devotes whatever time is required to \nthe board, especially if greater involvement is required than first realised (Coombes and \nWong, 2004). Equally, a sound knowledge of the industry, coupled with an \nindependence of mind, and having already served on the particular board in question, \nhave also been identified as desired Chairman attributes (Coombes and Wong, 2004). \n \nAlthough these attributes were mentioned by the study participants, the capacity to \nwork through board tensions whilst striving towards gaining a shared perspective from \nboard members, emerged as the more critical attributes for a Chairman. \nChairman & CEO \n11\/04\/2006 \n26\n \n\u201cHe is exceptionally capable - a quintessential Chairman. He can see \nthrough you and cut through nonsense, but at the same time he can \ngenerate space for real quality interactions where ideas can spark and \nflow freely, which at the end of a meeting he skilfully fuses to a new way \nforward.  Our occasional boardroom sparks can easily turn into fires, if \nnot skilfully handled. He possesses a certain distant\/closeness that is \nmotivating but difficult to capture.\u201d \n(CEO, Board 1) \nThe study respondents highlight that the capacity for independence to engage in and \nresolve disputes and minimise dysfunctional interactions, needs to be coupled with a \n\u201csense of presence\u201d, cloaked by a masterful maturity that does not evidently display \nego but more a quiet sense of character. \n \n\u201cSome people just have that indefinable quality, that \u2018je ne sais quoi\u2019 \nwhilst others have to work at it. The Chairman needs to have presence in \nthe boardroom but at the same time to give space to others. His role is one \nof the consolidator and for that reason he must be highly venerated by \nothers, otherwise you have bunch of oversized egos or one super large ego \nrunning your board.\u201d \n(NED 1, Board 1) \n \n\u201cMany think that a good Chairman needs to be ego-less. The reality is \nthat an ego-less Chairman is someone who has lost the zeal for work. On \nthe contrary, a good Chairman needs to have a big ego, but his ego must \nChairman & CEO \n11\/04\/2006 \n27\nbe mature, like the ego of a proud father whose son is doing well in \nschool.  The Chairman\u2019s power is continuous and unbounded creating \nboard norms which pave the way for a CEO performance that is visible to \nthe outside world.\u201d \n(Chairman, Board 1) \n \nThe personal qualities of presence, maturity and sense of independence were the \ningredients identified by the study participants for attaining consensus on the board.  \nHighly effective Chairmen were described as able to \u201csee meetings ahead\u201d, namely a \npoint in the future when consensus is more likely to be attained.  Thus, reaching \nmeaningful decisions as well as postponing decisions in order to revisit issues at \nsubsequent board meetings, was reported as part of the same skill set. \n \n\u201cA good Chairman is someone who achieves consensus on the board \nirrespective of the outcome and issue at hand. The Chairman\u2019s role does \nnot require value judgments but consensus. \u2026. On reflection, I think that I \nhave probably legitimised many illegitimate decisions. But that was \nexpected from my role.\u201d \n(Chairman, Board 2) \n \n\u201cA perfect Chairman is someone who, most of the time, creates board \ncohesion and achieves consensus on issues under consideration that is \nmoderated by ethical considerations in terms of means or ends.\u201d \n(Chairman, Board 4) \n \nChairman & CEO \n11\/04\/2006 \n28\nDiscussion \nThis study highlights two critical dynamics impacting on perceived board effectiveness; \nthe latent and underlying potencies of a board and the manifest, emerging dynamics \nevident through board member participation.  In realising the power of hidden potency, \nthe study participants report that an outstanding Chairman is able to comfortably raise \nsubmergent concerns to the realm of evident and workable dynamics. \n \nPeople can easily become conflicted creatures, not only driven by self interest and a \ndesire to self maximise, but also, to varying degrees, to benefit others and their \nenvironment, voluntarily devoting time and resource for social good.  Within the \ncontext of a board, a comparable range of self interest and social good perspectives \nemerged, partly driven by the orientation of each board member as well as their \n\u2018rationalist\u2019 view of their purpose and contribution to the board.  Such breadth of \ndiscretion leads to a diversity that requires bridging for the meaningful governance of \nthe enterprise.  However, the building of \u2018social and psychological\u2019 bridges in order to \nattain consensus is, at times, not realised, thus allowing for hidden perspectives to gain \na hold of the board undermining the firm principle of cabinet responsibility.  The study \nparticipants constantly referred to the disarray that arises when decisions are not \nmeaningfully made and\/or proactively implemented. \n \nTherefore in working towards board effectiveness, recognising, understanding and \nfocussing on the \u2018hidden potencies\u2019 that underlie the evident dynamics of a board, \nprecedes providing sensitive attention to relationships in order to build board members\u2019 \nconfidence to discuss what is viewed as \u2018undiscussable\u2019! The emergent view is that the \nChairman & CEO \n11\/04\/2006 \n29\nChairman is the one responsible for nurturing a positive climate of exploration and \ndialogue in a manner that the CEO and other board members find acceptable. \n \nHowever, the responsibility for maintaining a board environment of openness and \nresponse to challenge, particularly in terms of raising \u2018sensitivities\u2019, was reported as the \nshared responsibility of the Chairman and CEO.  Numerous study participants ascribed \nthe term \u2018inner cabal\u2019 to the Chairman\/CEO relationship emphasising that as the hub of \nthe board.  Such recognition is profound considering the origin of \u2018cabal\u2019.  The term \n\u2018cabal\u2019 emanates from classical cabbalistic theology which interlinks the union of male \nand female with divinity rather than obedience to divine will through laws and rituals \n(The Zohar, 1931).  For a Cabbalist, the greatest tragedy is the destruction of unity \nwithin the deity, namely the separation of the tenth aspect, Shekhinah, from her \nmetaphorical \u2018husband\u2019 the sixth aspect of the divine, Tif\u2019erath.  In a similar vein, the \nstudy participants emphasised that no alternative exists other than for the Chairman and \nCEO to continuously build on their relationship. \n \n\u201cThe CEO and I don\u2019t actually work hard at our relationship because we \nget on well, but we do work on it. I suppose we are lucky in that respect, \nbecause if we didn\u2019t get on as people, we would have to work really, really \nhard at it and I would have less time to devote to development of \nrelationships with other board members.\u201d \n(Chairman, Board 4) \n \nNo amount of attention to governance controls and procedures is perceived as \ncompensatory for an effective working relationship between the Chairman and the \nChairman & CEO \n11\/04\/2006 \n30\nCEO.  In fact, the study participants indicate that effective governance application is \ndependent on the Chairman and CEO nurturing a supportive and transparent \nrelationship and manner of interaction. \n \nThis study concludes that the subtleties of the Chairman\/CEO relationship can only be \ncontextually appreciated.  The effect of formative context in determining the nature of \nindividual experience, interaction and processes of socialisation is concluded as \nprofound.  It is not just up to the two incumbents to make something positive of their \ndyadic form but their attention to the circumstances in which they find themselves \nequally has a distinct impact on the development of this two fold interaction, the \nconsequence of which can reverberate for years. \n \nReferences \nBarratt, R., Korac-Kakabadse, N., Kakabadse, A. and Barratt, M.
