Encounters with this monument \nhave generated multitudinous materialities: hegemonic, conflicting and \nambiguous. These trajectories have their own material circulations in both solid \nand narrative forms. Here, we consider materiality through the cultures inspired \nby\/of the Wall. Through the formulation of an interdisciplinary methodology and \npraxis, we contribute to landscape studies generally and Romano-British frontier \nstudies in particular. Firstly, we consider the genealogies of thought through \nwhich the Wall has been created, including its definition as a contested border \nand its use to inform discourses of nation and empire. Secondly, the material \nlandscapes of the Wall are considered through phenomenon and encounter \ninformed by contemporary debates in anthropology, archaeology and cultural \ngeography. As part of the AHRC-funded Tales of the Frontier project \n(http:\/\/www.dur.ac.uk\/roman.centre\/hadrianswall\/), we aim to provide an enriched \naccount of the materialities of the Wall beyond traditional narratives generated by \nfieldwork and ancient historical texts.  \nKeywords: Hadrian\u201fs Wall, Roman archaeology, embodiment, heritage, \nmateriality \n \n3 \n \nArchaeologies of Landscape: Excavating the Materialities of Hadrian\u2019s Wall \n \nIntroduction \nRecent studies of World Heritage Sites such as Stonehenge, Avebury and \nNewgrange have addressed the significance of these iconic ancient monuments \nas contested spaces (Bender 1998; Harvey 2003). In contrast, Hadrian\u201fs Wall \n(and the other Roman monuments of Britain) remains curiously apolitical. Blain \nand Wallis (2004: 1) define boundaries and frontiers as significant \u201cspaces, both \nphysical and intellectual, which are never neutrally positioned, but are assertive, \ncontested and dialogic\u201d. Although some scholars have addressed the resonance \nof the Wall for past and contemporary societies (e.g. Barlow 2007; Ewin 2000; \nGriffiths 2003; Hingley 2006), there has been no sustained discussion of the \nsignificance of Hadrian\u201fs Wall as a contested landscape of great historical depth.  \nThe study of Roman frontier is a highly specialized sub-discipline (James 2002; \n2005: 501-2) which has claimed and created Hadrian\u201fs Wall as a primarily \nmilitary monument. Although some scholars have sought to diversify the scope of \nresearch and to integrate frontier studies into wider academic discourse, study of \nthe Wall retains a distinctive focus on issues of military planning and \nconstruction, warfare, soldiering and supply. This Roman military emphasis also \ndominates wider public appreciation of the Wall\u201fs political significance in past and \npresent, well characterized in novels, tourist literature and re-enactment events \n[Figure 1].  \n4 \n \n \nFigure 1. \u2018Living Frontier\u2019 re-enactment event at Corbridge, Northumberland, \nJune 2009 (Photo: R.Witcher) \nIn this paper we aim to draw out the political uses of the Wall through an analysis \nof its materiality. We consider how processes such as survey, excavation, \nillustration, conservation and World Heritage Site status have functioned, sub-\nconsciously or otherwise, to define hegemonic interpretations. For example, the \nboundary of the national spaces of England and Scotland has, since the \nsixteenth century, been sanctioned in a variety of texts and representations \nthrough promotion of the Wall\u201fs monumentality and its genealogical associations \n(Griffiths 2003; Hingley 2008: 86-7).  \nOur analysis considers three forms of materiality: the archaeological remains of \nthe Wall, the texts, images and artefacts which draw upon the Wall and, finally, \nthe landscape in which the Wall is situated. Drawing upon these three \nmaterialities, we seek to contest the idea that both the meaning and structure of \nthe Wall is \u201eset in stone\u201f. We aim to destabilize the widespread popular and \nacademic perception of the Wall as a purely Roman military monument in use \nfrom AD122 until the early fifth century. Whilst the vast majority of archaeological \nresearch has concentrated on these three centuries, we focus on the post-\n5 \n \nRoman material history of the Wall which helps to reveal contested and multiple \nmeanings. These disputed interpretations draw directly on the materialities of the \nWall whilst fundamentally reshaping them. For example, nineteenth century \nconservation sought to display the Roman structures by clearing away later \nconstructions such as medieval buildings, creating the monument we see today \n(Woodside & Crow 1999; see below); Victorian interpretations of the Wall\u201fs \nmeanings therefore led to its material transformation. Similarly, analysis of textual \nmaterials demonstrates even the name applied to the Wall is culturally-loaded \nwith expectations and assertions about its date, function and significance: \n\u201eHadrian\u201fs Wall\u201f is a recent consensus, but past names have included \u201ePicts \nWall\u201f, \u201eSeverus\u201f Wall\u201f and the \u201eRoman Wall\u201f, the latter still commonly used locally. \nThis analytical approach also encourages us to reconsider the interpretation of \nthe Wall during the Roman period itself, though this is not the focus of the \npresent paper. \nOur definition of materiality also includes the landscape of Hadrian\u201fs Wall. We \nseek to enrich the study of Roman landscapes through phenomenological \nmethods that until now have been largely restricted to prehistoric monuments \n(e.g. Tilley 1994). Specifically, we investigate the Wall and its landscape as a \nplace of embodied encounter in both past and present (Wylie 2002). Again we \nseek to identify the pluralities of experience which hegemonic discourse restricts \n(Foucault 1989) opening the way for the exploration of alternative embodied \nunderstandings of the Wall. In sum, we seek to unravel the ways in which \nHadrian\u201fs Wall has been visualized, narrated, visited and researched in order to \ndraw out its political values and to enrich and diversify its interpretation.  \nMaterialities of the Wall and its landscape \nA core motivation for this research is to challenge the restricted interpretation of \nthe Wall\u201fs meaning within academic and especially popular culture. Specifically, \nwe seek to question the implicit idea that the Wall was built for a specific purpose \n(e.g. defence) and that the Wall can be fully understood within such a narrow \nfunctional explanation. Moreover, with the end of Roman Britain in the early fifth \ncentury, the Wall\u201fs purpose and therefore its significance came to an end; hence, \nwhilst the construction of the Wall and the subsequent 250 years of Roman \noccupation have been considered in great depth (e.g. Breeze 2006: 49-93; \nBreeze & Dobson 2000; Bidwell 2008), its post-Roman history has received far \nless but growing attention (e.g. Ewin 2000; Griffiths 2003; Shannon 2007; \nWoodside & Crow 1999).  \nThe persistent and prevalent conceptualization of the Wall within military and \nfunctional terms draws upon \u2013 and in turn, shapes \u2013 the Wall\u201fs materialities. For \nexample, popular and commercial photography of Hadrian\u201fs Wall has \nconcentrated on the curtain wall and its dramatic positioning atop the Whin Sill \ncrags of the central sector [Figure 2]. This both draws upon and reinforces the \nnotion of a defensive boundary, articulated through monument, landscape and \nvisual materials. The contemporary meaning of the Wall is constructed and \nmediated through its materialities. Drawing on cultural materialist and post-\nstructuralist readings of the materiality, our research moves away from the idea \n6 \n \nof an archaeological monument which has physically endured whilst perceptions, \nvalues, texts and images have evolved around it. Rather, we sketch the ways in \nwhich the monument and its setting have materially changed alongside socio-\ncultural valuations in a transformative and affective relationship.  \n \nFigure 2. Hadrian\u2019s Wall. Location and places mentioned in the text (Map: C. \nUnwin) \nFor much of its history, the fabric of the Wall has been spoliated, or used as a \nquarry for other structures and monuments. This de-construction has involved \nthe rearrangement of the Wall\u201fs material components into nearby field walls, \nshielings, castles and churches (Whitworth 2000). These materials have also \nbeen transported to new locations, for example, stones and inscriptions were \ntaken from the Roman site at Corbridge to build the crypt at Hexham Abbey \nduring the seventh century (Eaton 2001: 111-27; Paul Bidwell pers. comm). Such \nreuse encompasses varied motives from the expedient recycling of building \nmaterials to the explicit appropriation of the cultural values associated with \nparticular objects (Bell 2005; Greenhalgh 2008). This recontextualization of the \nWall\u201fs materials destabilizes the notion of a static monument awaiting discovery; \nnot only are meanings of the Wall mutable, but the Wall itself is physically mobile. \nFurther, the materiality of the Wall is not the sum total of its constituent stone \nbuilding blocks. The landscape setting is an integral part of the monument and its \nmeanings. Planning and heritage management authorities seek to control the \nphysical appearance and values associated with this landscape, conserving its \nhistorical character. But just like the archaeological monument, the physical and \nconceptual setting of the Wall is far more diverse than its popular perception as \nwild and unspoilt suggests (Powe & Shaw 2003). For example, the physical \nlandscape seen today around the Roman fort of Housesteads in the central \nsector of the Wall is largely the product of nineteenth century land improvement \n(e.g. field boundaries, drainage); this \u201etimeless\u201f landscape (Richards & Clegg \n7 \n \n2008; Woodside and Crow 1999) is less than 150 years old and certainly not \n\u201eRoman\u201f. In fact, perceptions of this landscape have radically changed over time: \nWilliam Camden was unable to visit Housesteads in 1599 due to the threat from \nthe notorious Busy Gap Rogues (Birley 1961: 179; Crow 2007). In contrast, \nvisitor numbers between 2002 and 2007 averaged 108,000 per annum (National \nTrail 2008). In 400 years, this landscape has been transformed from dangerous \nand socially marginal into the most visited and photographed part of the \nNorthumberland National Park. At the same time, perceptions of the very shape \nand significance of the physical landscape have been transformed. As the \nHousesteads area has become physically and conceptually accessible through \nrailways, roads and guidebooks, perceptions of its topography have softened \nfrom \u201emountainous\u201f to \u201ehilly\u201f (compare Bruce 1851: 46 and Hodgson 1858: 44 \nwith Dillon 2008: 174). These words carry significant baggage in terms of social \nand cultural perceptions of security, civility and barbarism. Our material approach \ntherefore seeks not only to decentre hegemonic discourses of Wall, but also to \ndestabilize our assumptions about its very material form and location.  \nHistorical materialities of the Wall \nIn this section we consider a series of historical vignettes which illustrate the \nevolving materialities of Hadrian\u201fs Wall and the way in which they have inspired \nand been shaped by contemporary cultural and political ideas. This genealogical \napproach to the Wall underscores the valency of its meaning and therefore the \nculturally-constructed nature of current hegemonic discourses. \nThe northern frontiers of Roman Britain formed an early focus of interest for \nantiquarians (Birley 1961: 1-24; Hingley 2008; Todd 2004). Successive editions \nof Camden\u201fs Britannia report a growing number of Roman inscriptions collected \nby individuals such as John Senhouse during the late sixteenth and early \nseventeenth centuries. These objects served to connect localities and collectors \nin a frontier landscape to a wider classical past (Hepple 2003: 170; Hingley 2008: \n38-40). In this sense, the recovery and display of inscribed stones continues the \nprocess of spoliation, mobilizing the Wall both physically and conceptually, for \ncontemporary social and political purposes \nAlongside this fascination for portable objects and materials deriving from the \nWall, during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, there was growing \ninterest in the monument as a whole, and specifically its perceived location in the \nboundary zone between England and Scotland (Hingley 2008: 11). The presence \nof the Wall created difficulties for James I\u201fs project of political union (Griffiths \n2003), but provided a useful model for the Hanoverian surveying and colonization \nof Highland Scotland (Hingley 2006: 338-41). The Wall has provided rich \nmaterials for various contemporary political discourses about national identities \u2013 \nboth their assertion and their critique. \nIn such contexts, an increasing focus on the structure and location of the Wall \ncan be traced in both antiquarian mapping and early excavation (Birley 1961; \nHingley 2008: 85-156). Both practices demonstrate the tensions created by \nattempting to fix the mobility of meanings and materials. An early practice was to \n8 \n \nassociate and map specific sites with names drawn from the written sources \nsuch as the Notitia Dignitatum (a late Roman document listing army units and \ntheir stations) and the Rudge Cup (one of a number of small Roman vessels \nlisting forts on the Wall). However, attempts to identify and locate ancient places \non the ground led to new forms of mobility as names \u201emigrated\u201f between sites in \nthe light of new archaeological discoveries (e.g. (C)Amboglanna has been \nidentified with both Birdoswald and Castlesteads; Breeze 2006: 34-9; Rivet & \nSmith 1979). In contrast, decades of convention have led to certainty of name \nattribution and form which may not be supported by the evidence. For example, \nthe Roman town\/station of Corbridge is widely-known as Corstopitum on the \nbasis of the Antonine Itinerary (a Roman \u201eroad map\u201f listing places and distances \nbetween them), but the site\u201fs name also appears in different forms in other \nancient documents: Corielopocarium (the Ravenna Cosmography, a late Roman \nlist of placenames) and Coria\/Coris (the Vindolanda writing tablets). In this \nexample, brown heritage road signs also serve to fossilize \u201eCorstopitum\u201f as the \nofficial name. Hence, though scholars have attempted to stabilize knowledge of \nthe Wall, there are tensions within the Wall\u201fs materialities about the certainty of \ninterpretations. \nSimilarly, the fieldwork of antiquarians and archaeologists has effectively sought \nto fix meanings of the Wall by physically digging into and rearranging the \nmonument\u201fs material form. For example, nineteenth century excavations dug into \nthe remains of many of the Roman forts along the Wall (Ewin 2000). Not only \nwas post-Roman evidence destroyed in order to reach the Roman levels buried \nbeneath, but even some Roman structural features were selectively removed, for \nexample, reopening fort gateways which had been blocked very shortly after they \nwere originally constructed (e.g. the second century blocking of the east portal of \nthe south gate at Birdoswald was removed during the 1851 excavations, Breeze \n2006: 300). Such excavations valorized not simply the Roman phases of \noccupation at these sites by cutting through and destroying post-Roman \nstratigraphy, but sought specifically to discover and understand the earliest and \noriginal phases. This highly selective process created a synchronic landscape; \nlong complex histories of occupation were tidied and made to connect with a \nsingle moment in time (i.e. the Hadrianic construction period, c.AD122-130). \nSubsequent material histories were literally wiped away, restoring what was \ndeemed to be authentic form and meaning. As a result of this simplification of the \narchaeological monument (e.g. Clayton\u201fs work to display the Hadrianic phases of \nthe fort at Chesters, Breeze 2006: 195-209), the post-Hadrianic history of the \nWall was, and continues to be, marginalized. Even the extensive evidence for \nrebuilding of the Wall during the Roman period, for example Severus\u201f restoration \nwork in the early third century, is sidelined in the dominant popular and academic \nnarratives. \nThis attention to the earliest structures underlines the fact that excavators do not \nsimply reveal the past, but actively construct it by prioritizing material traces \n(Shanks 1992); in effect, constructing \u201e(neo-)Roman-ness\u201f. The work of John \nClayton is a case in point. From the 1830s, Clayton bought properties along the \nline of the Wall to protect the monument from destruction and to display it publicly \n9 \n \n(Woodside & Crow 1999). His works included dismantling post-Roman structures \n(e.g. the farmhouse at Housesteads) restoring an \u201eauthentic\u201f Roman monument. \nHe also exposed stretches of the Wall, reassembling collapsed stone blocks \nback into a structural form. The resulting Wall (known archaeologically as the \n\u201eConsolidated Wall\u201f or \u201eClayton\u201fs Wall\u201f) has become synonymous with Hadrian\u201fs \nWall, in much the same way that twentieth century \u201erestoration\u201f of the Great Wall \nof China has become the definitive Chinese Wall (Waldron 1992).  \nClayton\u201fs work is frequently perceived as the emergence of the practice of \nconservation (Crow 2004: 131); from a materials perspective, these interventions \nare part of an ongoing dialogue which draws cultural values from the Wall, \nextending from the crypt at Hexham to contemporary reconstructions at \nWallsend, South Shields and Vindolanda [FIGURE 3]. Such (re)constructions \nstress an inherent tension between the physical monumentality of the Wall and \nthe mobility of its components and meanings. Consolidation and reconstruction \nserve to fix the form and perception of the Wall, asserting legitimacy through their \nsheer stony presence \u2013 interpretations are literally \u201eset in stone\u201f. But through their \nproliferation, these reconstructions also generate new and competing visions \nwhich erode the notion of a single authentic Roman Wall. Matters of scholarly \ndispute, such as whether or not the Wall was topped with crenellations, are \nliterally played out in solid form through these competing monuments.   \n10 \n \n \nFigure 3.

Witcher) \nIn comparison with many of the Greek and Roman monuments of the \nMediterranean, such as the Colosseum, Hadrian\u201fs Wall is notoriously \ninsignificant in terms of the canon of classical literature \u2013 it is mentioned only \nonce or twice in the surviving sources. Nonetheless, the material recovered by \nexcavation has been repeatedly located and interpreted in terms of text-based \nhistories, in particular, it is used to \u201ematerialize\u201f specific historical events \n(generally, Porter 2003). This is well-illustrated by nineteenth and early twentieth \ncentury attempts to relate phases of burning and destruction at many of the forts \nto hostile incursions from north of the Wall, thus demonstrating the historical \nveracity of, for example, the \u201eBarbarian Conspiracy of 367\u201f (Amm. Marc. 27.8.1-\n28.3.9). As Breeze (2005: 40) emphasizes, such readings of textual and \narchaeological evidence are intimately connected with (often implicit) \nassumptions about the function of the Wall informed by contemporary values. \nWithin the context of broader societal attitudes towards frontiers as defensive \nand exclusive, scholars have prioritized scarce and unrepresentative historical \nsources and used the very materiality of the Wall to make them tangible. Even \nthe scholarly language used to describe the Wall is culturally-loaded and informs \n11 \n \nwider interpretation. For example, the now universal category of \u201efort\u201f engenders \nparticular expectations of military occupation and masculinity, especially when \ncompared to earlier terms such as \u201estation\u201f or \u201ecity\u201f as used by antiquarians such \nas Camden. \nThe value of the Wall as a material connection to Mediterranean civilization has \nalso evolved. During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the limited \ntextual materials relating to the Wall \u2013 and its location on the edge of empire \u2013 \ndefined the study of Hadrian\u201fs Wall as peripheral to mainstream classical \nscholarship which focused on Italy and Greece (Dyson 2006; Scott 2003). At the \nsame time, the classical origin of the monument was linked together with its \nphysical location at the north-western periphery of the Roman Empire. In cultural \nterms, Hadrian\u201fs Wall, when compared to Hadrian\u201fs Villa at Tivoli or the \nPantheon in Rome, was not a high-status example of classical architecture, but \nthis did not prevent its use in discourses about nation and empire. The physical \nvisibility of this grand genealogical and imperial monument at the edge of English \nnational space led to its use as a metaphor for the boundaries of English identity \nand for the wider political frontier of British imperial space (Hingley 2000; 2008). \nAt the same time, interest in the British landscape fluctuated with continental \npolitics which prevented physical access to the Mediterranean; exclusion from \nthe Greco-Roman core refocused attention on the classical world \u201eat home\u201f (e.g. \nBruce during 1848; Birley 1961: 26). The secondary status of British archaeology \ncan be traced within academic circles well into the twentieth century; the Wall \nremained \u201ea training ground\u201f (Freeman 2007) for the proper work of classical \narchaeologists in the Mediterranean. However, the sheer physical monumentality \nand presence of the Wall (and the paradoxical lack of texts) demanded the \nattention of antiquarians and archaeologists. Hence, despite its inferior status, \nthe study of the northern frontiers was at the forefront of the development of \narchaeological method in Britain including innovative hypothesis-driven \napproaches of a sort inconceivable in the contemporary archaeology of classical \nItaly or Greece. For example, by the late nineteenth century, the rapid \naccumulation of material evidence could no longer be contained within a \nstraightforward structural account based on the assumption of an architect\u201fs \n(Hadrian\u201fs?) \u201eblueprint\u201f. A more complex building sequence was hypothesized \nand verified by targeted excavations which successfully located earlier structural \nsequences beneath the forts demonstrating a series of changes during the \nconstruction of the Wall (Couse 1990). Thus, the materiality of the Wall is \nmutable, but not mute; its materials and meanings can be reworked and \nmobilized, but are not infinite (Tilley 2004: 219). \nContemporary materialities \nFurther attempts to stabilize and define the materials and meanings of the Wall \ncan be documented through the proliferation of legal and statutory designation \nduring the twentieth century. These extend from some of the earliest attempts by \nthe State to list (\u201eschedule\u201f) ancient monuments through to its current World \nHeritage Site status (Mason et al. 2003).  \nThe aim of these statutory designations is to protect the fabric and setting of the \n12 \n \nWall from damage or disturbance. \u201eScheduling\u201f (under the Ancient Monuments \nand Archaeological Areas Act 1979, but originating in 1882) identifies \nmonuments of \u201enational importance\u201f to be given particular legal protection by the \nState. The criteria are broad (e.g. \u201epotential to contribute to information, \nunderstanding and appreciation\u201f, AMAAA 1979) and serve to institutionalize the \nclose association between ancient monuments and national identity for political \npurposes. Monumental sites such as Stonehenge, Avebury and Hadrian\u201fs Wall \nconstitute productive foci of political discourses and moral geographies (Bender \n1998; Ewin 2000; Harvey 2003); legal designation defines, appropriates and \nsustains the cultural and political values of these monuments through their \ncreation as national heritage. But as noted in the introduction, whilst monuments \nsuch as Stonehenge are widely understood as powerful and contested in these \nterms, Hadrian\u201fs Wall generally is not. \nMore recently, World Heritage Site status has attempted to redefine these \nnational values as universal values. In 1987 Hadrian\u201fs Wall was inscribed on the \nlist of internationally-significant monuments under UNESCO cultural criteria ii, iii \n& iv (ICOMOS 1987) citing the Wall as an \u201coutstanding example of a fortified \nlimes [or Roman frontier].\u201d The inscription continues \u201cNo other ensemble from the \nRoman Empire illustrates as ambitious and coherent a system of defensive \nconstructions perfected by engineers over the course of several generations\u2026 \n[T]his cultural property is an exceptional reference whose universal value leaves \nno doubt\u201d. In 2005, the WHS inscription was extended as the transnational \n\u201eFrontiers of the Roman Empire\u201f to incorporate sections of the Roman frontier in \nGermany (WHC 2005; Breeze and Jilek 2008). However, boundaries and \nfrontiers are by their nature divisive (Blain & Wallis 2004) and their promotion in \nterms of universal heritage is consequently problematic (Creighton 2007; \ngenerally, Labadi 2007). As heritage, these monuments must be distanced and \nde-problematized before they can become shared universally (Fowler 1992). \nA new stage in the Wall\u201fs material history was reached in 2003, when the \nHadrian\u201fs Wall National Trail was opened providing a fully way-marked path \nalong the entire length of the Wall; in 2006, the Hadrian\u201fs Way cyclepath \n(NCR72) was also established. These new routes have had a profound impact \non the materialities of the Wall. Visitor numbers have increased significantly \nleading to management concerns about erosion of the Wall\u201fs fragile fabric (BBC \n2005; Newman 2008); but more prominent is the new and rich attendant material \ncultures generated and their influence on the landscape and interpretation of the \nWall. A proliferation of signposts to guide visitors serves to \u201ebrand\u201f the Wall, \ncreating a new and tangible sense of unity and sanctioning the appropriate way \nto experience it. [FIGURE 4] This street furniture also (re)materializes the \nmonument in areas where urban development and agricultural improvement \nhave diminished or destroyed its physical presence. This process is particularly \napparent on Tyneside. Apart from faint echoes in the alignment of streets, the \nWall has long disappeared beneath medieval and modern settlement. However, \nthere is a history of rematerializing the Wall within the urban fabric. The large-\nscale redevelopment of Newcastle during the nineteenth century revealed \ntantalizing traces of the city\u201fs Roman forbear (Pons Aelius). As well as the \n13 \n \ncollection of inscribed stones, the Roman past was rematerialized through \ncommemoration, for example, a plaque on Neville Hall draws attention to paving \nwhich marks the line of the Wall. [FIGURE 5] The Neoclassical redevelopment of  \nNewcastle by Dobson and Grainger can be located within a wider mid-nineteenth \ncentury trend which found inspiration in the Greek and Roman world generally, \nbut it may also have drawn on the emerging traces of the city\u201fs own Classical \npast (Wilkes & Dobbs 1964).  \n \nFigure 4. Hadrian's Wall street furniture. Sign post on the Hadrian\u2019s Wall National \nTrail at Newburn, Newcastle upon Tyne (Photo: R. Witcher) \n \n14 \n \n \nFigure 5. Commemorative plaque on Neville Hall, Westgate Road, Newcastle \nupon Tyne. (Photo: R. Witcher) \n \nSuch rematerialization continues today. Public art such as the Newcastle through \nthe Ages (by Henry and Joyce Collins, 1974) draws on the city\u201fs Roman past to \ncreate a narrative of famous men, commerce and, particularly, engineering \n(Usherwood et al. 2000: 125-6) and signs at Wallsend Metro station inform and \nadvise commuters in Latin as well as English. These materialities presence the \nRoman past in a landscape devoid of extant monumental traces and assert \nconnections between local and Roman achievement and shared moral \naspirations. \nAnother rich material culture which has proliferated in recent years is the Hadrian \n\u201ebrand\u201f. Businesses, public agencies and individual buildings have drawn upon \nthe name to project their local (specifically North-eastern) identity. Healthcare \nprovision, air-conditioning installation, bottled water and industrial estates \namongst many other examples all promote their business through the \u201eHadrian\u201f \nbrand. This emperor\u201fs name has become metonymic for the Wall and the region. \nIt is a shorthand way to associate goods and services with the monument \n(enduring, solid and reliable) and hence to the suggestion of local and regional \nprovenance. So rich are these recent material cultures that Barlow (2007) \nsuggests that the North-east has turned its attention from its industrial past to its \nearlier Roman heritage as a more positive and inclusive source of inspiration for \nregional identity, citizenship and heritage. \nIn the 2000s, the diverse geographical origins of the Roman soldiers represented \non the Wall has been used to create a more inclusive role for the Wall than that \nrepresented in late nineteenth and twentieth century texts and images, which \noften view it as a Roman military monument or as an English or imperial structure \nthat dominated and excluded the uninvited and unassimilated (Hingley 2000). \nThe more inclusive perception has come to prominence through a popular \nemphasis on wider access to the monument and a focus upon the varied \nconstituencies that built and occupied the Wall. This open agenda fits the focus \n15 \n \nof various agencies in the encouragement of visitors to the Wall from the urban \ncentres of northern England and also from abroad (Newman 2008: 29).  \nAnother manifestation of this broadening of access is the art project Writing on \nthe Wall (Chettle 2006). This project re-imagines the Wall as a multinational \nmonument. The introduction to the published volume emphasizes that the Wall \nhas a special role as a place \u201cwhere people of all kinds, often drawn from remote \nplaces \u2013 the Roman army itself recruited as far afield as north Africa, Romania \nand Turkey \u2013 have wandered, fought, loved and worked during the two thousand \nyears\u201d (O\u201fBrien 2006: 10). In the same volume, Margaret Lewis summarizes \nWriting on the Wall by remarking that the project was formed by a group of British \nwriters together with an international group drawn from the countries which \nprovided the garrisons for the Wall. It included poets from Morocco, Romania, \nIraq, the Netherlands and Bulgaria (Lewis 2006: 16). The individual artists \nreflected their own history in a multitude of ways by writing of contemporary \nconcerns in addressing the Wall. Some found it easy to imagine life among the \nsettlements, \u201cespecially the life of women and ordinary soldiers\u201d (ibid). Asking, \n\u201cSo who does own the Stones?\u201d, Lewis answers by stating \u201cEvery writer, every \nartist, every musician, every visitor who has stopped to wonder and to respond to \nthis World Heritage site. This heritage is for us all\u201d (ibid). These works develop \nideas drawn from the varied populations represented in Roman times on the \nWall, refocusing inherited ideas of Hadrian\u201fs Wall as military and political \nboundary.  \nSome of the items published through the Writing of the Wall initiative, however, \ncast a reflective gaze on issues of colonization. For example, Samuel Shimon, an \nIraqi writer who now lives in London, considered his experience while visiting the \nmouth of the Tyne: \nI was eating fish and chips and hearing a voice telling me: \u201eYour Ancestors \nwere working here. They were ferrymen from the Tigris\u201f. I was nodding my \nhead and saying, yes, my ancestors were slaves here. Slaves under the \nsame sky\u201f (Shimon 2006, 77). \nThe Tigris boatmen were not, in reality, slaves in Roman terms, but auxiliary \nsoldiers. The way that we consider these people, however, is at least partly a \nreflection of the dominant perspective from the writing of the Roman Empire, \nwhich views imperial assimilation, Romanization or \u201ebecoming Roman\u201f, in a \ndirectly positive fashion (van Driel Murray 2002; Hingley in press; Mattingly \n2006). Roman auxiliary soldiers may have been recruited in ways that exploited \ntheir own cultural qualities, but they were also marginalized through the creation \nof an imperial system of order which worked to the benefits of certain dominant \nplayers (Hingley in press).  \nArchaeologists are involved in this realignment of interests through new \nscholarship on gender, ethnic identity, community and non-military lifeways \n(Allason-Jones 2001a; 2001b; Bowman 1998; Derks & Roymans 2002; van-Driel \nMurray 2002; Hingley 2004; James 2001; Symonds & Mason 2009). In these \nterms, popular appreciations and academic research illustrate the transformation \n16 \n \nof common interests. \nMaterial Cultures of Embodiment \nThis section turns to embodied encounters of Hadrian\u201fs Wall and its landscape. \nIn response to the scholarly emphasis on representation, the recent \u201ematerial \nturn\u201f in the social sciences has looked to embodiment and phenomenology as \nboth philosophy and methodology. Here we consider the relationship between \nrepresentation and experience through the material cultures of the Wall, \nspecifically photographic practices and on-site performance. We explore the \nways in which Hadrian\u201fs Wall and its landscape have been experienced both \nhistorically and today. This study is therefore located at a critical point between \narchaeology and geography; how can we access past experiences and how can \nwe understand the historical depth affecting contemporary encounters? \nFrom an early date, a small number of visual representations of the Wall and its \nlandscape have assumed iconic status. These \u201epioneer images\u201f establish a visual \nmodel which serves to commodify monuments and landscapes (Balm & Holcomb \n2003: 159). Once established, motifs endure through different media, creating \nsanctioned ways of viewing. In particular, these views can be located within the \nRomantic tradition. Representation of the Wall, particularly in the central sector \nwas manipulated to engender the sublime (Ewin 2000; FIGURE 6). Most \nobviously these views dramatize the Whin Sill crags, excluding the flatter \nsurrounding topography especially to the north. Similarly, the divide between \ncultural and natural is dissolved; the Wall merges into the natural landscape, \nliterally growing out of the crags. The repetition of these images helps to \nunderwrite specific notions concerning the function and values of the Wall (e.g. \ndefence, civilization vs. barbarity).  \n \nFigure 6. Woodcut of Castle Nick (Milecastle 39) and Hadrian\u2019s Wall on the Whin \nSill (from Bruce 1895: 174). \nMore widely, the circulation of such images is intimately associated with tourism, \nfrom the Grand Tour to the present. Once established, these images continue to \n17 \n \ncirculate because they structure and fulfil expectations, constituting a metric by \nwhich experience is judged (Balm & Holcomb 2003: 170; Caton & Santos 2008: \n11). When visiting sites, tourists may even reproduce these views in their own \nphotographic practices, \u201eclosing the hermeneutic circle\u201f (ibid.). Consideration of \nthe historical production and circulation of images and the history of visiting \nsuggests that these issues are closely inter-related; John Collingwood Bruce \ncommissioned the artist Thomas Richardson to produce watercolours to illustrate \nhis talks about the Wall to the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle and he took \nRichardson\u201fs two sons, also artists, along the Wall to produce images for his \nHandbook to the Roman Wall (Breeze 2003: 3). Bruce\u201fs stated intention was to \nproduce visual proof of the Wall\u201fs monumentality, lest his oral reports were not \nbelieved (Birley 1961: 26). The study of embodied encounter must therefore \nacknowledge that the circulation of images may \u201escript\u201f ways of seeing and being \nin the landscape. \nTilley (2004) has asserted that recent approaches to landscape are primarily \n\u201epaper\u201f; too much attention has focused on representation rather than \nexperience. The social sciences have sought to redress this situation by focusing \non embodiment. The impact of Tilley\u201fs (1994) own contribution has been swift \nand profound. Landscapes and monuments are experienced bodily (Edensor \n2005). Phenomenological studies of past peoples\u201f experiences have focused \nheavily on prehistoric societies, particularly the monumental landscapes of the \nBritish Neolithic; there have been few studies concerning Roman landscapes (for \nan early example, Witcher 1998) and none of Hadrian\u201fs Wall. Nonetheless, the \nperceived military function of Hadrian\u201fs Wall has generated many studies which \nindirectly focus on the senses and bodily experience. Most obviously, there has \nbeen much attention to the visibility afforded from atop the Wall and to the way in \nwhich the military architecture controlled movement (e.g. Woolliscroft 2001). In \nmany respects these studies mimic the explicitly phenomenological studies of \nprehistory, but derive from the military interests of Roman frontier studies \n(generally, see James 2002). \nPhenomenological approaches have helped to critique Cartesian assumptions. \nHowever, the work of Tilley and others has in turn been critiqued on a range of \nlevels. From an historical perspective, the assumption that modern bodies, \nemotions and sensibilities can be used to access past experiences has been \nquestioned (Br\u00fcck 2005). In particular, Tilley (1994) has made explicit claims for \nthe use of empathy to access past experiences. Such phenomenological \napproaches may indirectly reinforce Enlightenment concepts such as the \nindividual, whilst failing to address the culturally contingent construction of \nsenses and emotions. As human beings we cannot step outside our cultures in \norder to experience the world \u201eas it really is\u201f. Perception is interpretation; senses \nand emotions are culturally defined (Ingold 2000). A phenomenology of Hadrian\u201fs \nWall can therefore never present a uniform experience of place in either the \npresent or past. However, the idea that contemporary bodies can access past \nexperience is arguably the basis of approaches to the Wall which emphasize \nsurveillance and control of movement; through a familiarity with the landscape \nand empathy with the (military) people in it, Roman archaeologists have claimed \n18 \n \nto understand the function, use and impact of the monument.  \nIt is not only archaeologists who empathize with past peoples\u201f experiences. One \nof the most widely read and heard observations about the Wall concerns visitors\u201f \nempathy with the soldier stuck in a cold climate and bleak landscape on the edge \nof the empire. Such contemporary encounters are another avenue for \nphenomenological enquiry. The monument attracts huge numbers of visitors, \ncontinuing a long practice of visiting and, specifically, \u201ewalking\u201f the Wall (i.e. from \nend-to-end). Hutton (1990) is often said to have been the first person to walk the \nlength of the Wall in 1801 and Bruce instigated a decennial \u201epilgrimage\u201f along the \nWall in 1849 (Nesbitt & Tolia-Kelly 2009). In walking along the central sector of \nthe Wall today, most visitors\u201f physical experience is elided with that of the Roman \nsoldier; visitors\u201f re-garrison the Wall, hold the strategic high ground and \ncommand the view to the north. Few visitors cross the Wall to walk in Barbaricum \nbeyond. Contemporary visiting practices may therefore produce a very specific \nexperience and interpretation of the Wall (Witcher in preparation). \nAbove, specific visual representations of the Wall were situated in the context of \nRomanticism. However, this movement also attached importance to walking and \nexperience; these were landscapes to be visually consumed and physically \nexperienced (Johnson 2006). In the context of early tourism, visual \nrepresentations strongly shaped perceptions of destinations; similarly, \nguidebooks directed embodied encounters. Bruce\u201fs Handbook to the Roman \nWall (first published in 1851) stimulated and catered for growing demand for \nphysical and intellectual access to historical and geographical knowledge in the \ncontext of nineteenth century imperialist notions of science and improvement \nwhich mapped, measured, and ordered the world (Said 1978). The current \nabundance of guides for the National Trail and travelogues of walkers\u201f \nexperiences amply document this continuing tradition. Each of these texts and \nimages defines a way of appreciating and understanding the history and meaning \nof the Wall and, specifically, the appropriate bodily encounter with implications for \ngeometries of power (Massey 2006; Tolia-Kelly 2006). \nThe material cultures of tourism (brochures, guidebooks, signposts, etc.) are \ncritical for a study of embodied experience of the Wall. In the contemporary \nworld, landscapes are rarely experienced independently of visual material \ncultures, especially heritage sites such as Hadrian\u201fs Wall. An investigation of \nembodied encounters therefore demands attention to cultural context and \nrepresentation.  \nTourist material cultures teach visitors how to \u201ebe\u201f in the landscape \u2013 what to \nvalue and therefore what to disregard; how to move and perceive. For example, \nguidebooks routinely describe (and hence prescribe) movement from east to \nwest. However, prevailing winds and the impracticalities of containing such an \narrangement within a conventional book format recommend walking from west to \neast. Nonetheless, guidebooks maintain the conventional archaeological \nnumbering system starting at Wallsend. The National Trail has generated \nsignificant new material cultures which script visitor movement, disciplining \nbehaviour and codifying experience. There is also a tension between the ways in \n19 \n \nwhich these routes each sanction a single authentic linear experience of the Wall \nwhilst simultaneously creating multiple alternative ways of encountering the \nmonument. The National Trail and Hadrian\u201fs Cycleway prescribe specific routes, \nsometimes coterminous with the Wall, sometimes diverging especially in urban \nareas. The proliferation of these routes both prescribes experience and \ndiversifies possible encounters at the same time. Just as the Wall\u201fs materials \nmay be disassembled and moved around, so the line of the Wall itself may shift \nand multiply.  \nFor a phenomenological study of embodied encounters of the Wall, it is important \nto draw on the range of scholarly studies which have systematically diminished \nanalytical categories. For example, tourist studies have blurred the distinction \nbetween tourist and host\/local (preferring \u201evisitor\u201f to encompass both); \narchaeological phenomenologies have eroded the difference between \ncontemporary and past experiences (Br\u00fcck 2005) and questioned the role of \nspecialists as guardians of knowledge (Stout 2008). Analysis of embodied \npractices on the Wall therefore sits at a critical point between the experiences of \nbodies past and present, lay and specialist; it draws together studies of tourist \nbehaviours with the ethnography of archaeological practice. Performance recasts \nvisitors as active makers of meaning in and of the landscape (Shanks & Pearson \n2001).  \nAs well as \u201ebeing\u201f in this landscape, visitors also create images of it; analysis of \nthese materials demonstrates the way in which these images both respond to \nand create meaning and value through subject, framing and lighting. In order to \nunderstand contemporary visitor photography on the Wall, it is necessary to \nlocate these images in the context of a genealogy of visual representation, \nespecially those circulating in tourist literature. Studies have explored the degree \nto which visitors \u201eclose the hermeneutic circle\u201f through their own photographic \npractices or whether this wrongly casts visitors as helpless victims of scripted \nbehaviour (Edensor 2001; 2004: 198). The existence of iconic images and \ncultural currencies does not mean that visitors cannot decode and bypass such \nthemed space, especially when confronted by the gaps between representation \nand encounter. To return to the sublime image of the Wall snaking over \nundulating crags, the power of this image draws on the exaggerated vertical \ntopography, crowned and enhanced by the Wall. However, following the Trail \nalong these crags, it is the flat expanses and distant horizons which capture the \neye. Hence the horizontal visual plane is juxtaposed to the physical exertion of \nsteep vertical ascent and descent; this embodied gaze helps to reveal the \ncultural construction of visual genres such as the sublime.  \nConclusions \nIn this paper we have engaged with the materialities of Hadrian\u201fs Wall through an \napproach that explores phenomenology and the genealogy of knowledge. In \ncontrast to dominant academic traditions and popular perceptions, we have \ndeliberately sought to destabilize the field of enquiry to enable more fluid and \nplural accounts of the meaning and value of the frontier. Of course, our own \naccounts are also partial; bounded through disciplinary training and Eurocentric \n20 \n \nnotions of frontier and landscape, but this paper offers an opening towards a \nmore dialogic account of the Wall\u201fs materiality. In sum, we hope to have \npresented a different form of \u201eexcavation\u201f in our material approach to the \ncontestable monuments of Roman Britain. \nAcknowledgements \nWe would like to thank our Tales of the Frontier project colleague Claire Nesbitt \nfor ongoing discussion and comments on earlier drafts, and the anonymous \nreviewers for their valuable comments and insights.
