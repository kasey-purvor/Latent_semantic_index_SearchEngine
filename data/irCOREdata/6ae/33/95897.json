Prison ethnographies \nhave, for the most part, paid scant attention to the \u2018crisis of representation\u2019 \nthat has animated those disciplines, and barely engaged with either the \n\u2018postmodernist turn\u2019 or the \u2018autobiographical turn\u2019. This is not to suggest, \nhowever, that methodological debates regarding researcher and prisoner \npositionality have been entirely absent (see for example Genders and Player \n1989, 1995, Bosworth 1999, Liebling 2001).  \n \nThis paper attends to these issues more comprehensively, drawing on two \nprison ethnographies of a medium security adult male prison and a young \noffenders\u2019 institution which sought to understand prisoners\u2019 identities and \ntheir impact on social relations. It is argued that the relative neglect of \nresearcher subjectivities and positionalities impoverishes the appreciation of \ndifference and diversity. To foreground this, the paper begins with an \noverview of epistemological and methodological debates which have  \ninfluenced ethnographic practice.  \n \nEthnographic Traditions I - Insider\/Outsider debates \nMethodological debates about Insider-Outsider dynamics are situated within \na modernist discourse of a positivist epistemology which seeks a single, \nuniversal truth. Outlined in a classic paper, Merton (1972) argued that \ndisputed knowledge claims arise in increasingly fractured societies in which \nminority social and cultural groups challenge the orthodox intellectual claims \nof the status quo.  \n \nThe Insider position posits that only those from within the ascribed status \ngroup have access to understanding their cultural practices and norms. Thus, \nfor example, only black people can possess a genuine understanding of the \nsocial realities of black feelings, values, behaviours and cultural experiences. \nAt the same time, because of asymmetrical social relations within white and \nblack society in America, black scholars (as Outsiders) may be sensitised to \nmainstream culture and social structures because they have been \ndisadvantaged by them, thus allowing them a kind of privileged quasi-Insider \nstanding. Conversely, it is argued, Insider positionality can engender a \nmyopic view of social reality, whereas the Outsider can objectively enquire of \nsocial groups\u2019 significant practices or experiences because they are unfamiliar, \nas captured in Simmel\u2019s (1950) notion of the \u2018stranger\u2019. \n \nField Code Changed\nField Code Changed\nField Code Changed\nField Code Changed\nDeleted: Ethnogrpahic\n 2\nSuch sweeping claims for Insiderism have been easily refuted with the \ncounter-claim of essentialism. Indeed, Merton (1972) himself recognised \nconsiderable heterogeneity within social groups, that social groups borrow \nideas from each other rather than them being held only by one group, and \nthat individuals have a number of interrelated statuses and not a singular one \nwhich solely defines their behaviour and perspectives. Merton also \nacknowledged shifts in status as Insiders become Outsiders and vice-versa \n(see also Alexander 2004). In essence, Merton (1972: 33) recognised that \u2018the \nbalance sheet for Outsider observers resembles that for Insider observers, \nboth having their distinctive assets and liabilities.\u2019  \n \nThe erstwhile dilemmas of Insider-Outsider positionalities have been only \npartly usurped by postmodernists\u2019 rejection of binary oppositional categories, \nmeta-narratives, and the chimera of universal truths. These challenge the \ntraditional ethnographic possibilities of narrating a singular external reality. \nPostmodernist influence in ethnography, in order to avoid privileging the \nethnographer\u2019s voice, has been represented through polyvocal dialogue, \ntextual and visual forms, sometimes with no external authorial evaluation or \nordering.  \n \nResearcher positionality remains firmly on the methodological and \nepistemological agenda, however, and there is now greater recognition of the \nunproductive effects of reductionist approaches which foreground a single \nidentity, say race\/ethnicity, over others such as gender, class, nationality and \nsexuality (Coloma 2008). More commonly, intersectional understandings \npredominate, recognising multidimensional subject positions. There is \nacknowledgement too of the solidity of subject positions but also of their \nrelational, contingent, fragmentary, and continually-being-formed nature \n(Hall 1997, Arber 2000). \n \nEthnographic Traditions II - Standpoint Epistemologies and Reflexivity \nAlongside these developments has been feminists\u2019 critique of male-dominated \nknowledge production. Feminist theorists promoted the importance of \nproducing knowledge from the situated experiences of women, so that a \ngendered understanding, for example, comes only from representing the \nstandpoint of women and their socially structured and materially defined \noppressive realities (see for example Harstock 1983, Harding 1987, and in \ncriminology: Cain 1990). Such accounts were themselves subsequently \nproblematised for failing to acknowledge multiplicities of experience \nstructured through the stratifying axes of race\/ethnicity and class. What was \nrequired was an intersectional understanding recognising the need to avoid \ncompartmentalising subjectivities (Hill Collins 1990, Rice 1990) or assume a \nsimplistic hierarchy of power relations (Bar-On 1993).  Standpoint \nField Code Changed\nField Code Changed\nField Code Changed\nField Code Changed\nField Code Changed\n 3\nepistemologies were also increasingly recognised as themselves discursive \nformations which also tended toward an absolutist conception of truth \n(Hekman 1997). \n \nA route out of this epistemological cul-de-sac has been to promote the \nimportance of reflexive understanding, which literally involves a \u2018turning \nback on oneself\u2019 (Aull Davies 1999: 4) as ethnographers see themselves as \ncentrally implicated in what is observed in the field, but also in the topics they \nhave selected for study, and in the analysis and writing up of research \nfindings. In this way the ethnographic field is regarded as internal rather than \nexternal; it is constituted by the ethnographer (Ely et al. 1997) who must also \nreflect on the social contexts of research subjects\u2019 lived experiences.  \n \nReflexive approaches are not without their problems, however. Lal (1996) \npoints to the ways in which women\u2019s studies\u2019 scholars invoke the obligatory \nmantra of self-positioning without engaging with their positionality and its \nimpact on the interpretive process - what Alexander (2004: 138) refers to as \n\u2018reflexivity-by-rote\u2019 . Similarly, Maynard (2002), suggests that reflexivity is a \nlaudable aim but hard to operationalise and achieve in practice. Such a \nperspective also ultimately runs the risk of becoming solely inward-focused \nas the ethnographer engages in an infinite, narcissistic regress of self-\nconscious self-interrogations. Another danger is to privilege the voice of the \nethnographer over research subjects, a key criticism of the \u2018autobiographical \nturn\u2019 in anthropology (Foley 2002, Coffey 1999). Attention to authorial \u2018voice\u2019 \nraises complex dilemmas concerning a tendency, on the one hand, to \nventriloquise or \u2018speak for\u2019 silenced voices and on the other, of a form of \ntextual laryngitis in which the author\u2019s voice is apparently silent, though \neverywhere present and nowhere identifiable. In this context the voices of \nresearch subjects are offered as positional contextualisations of an otherwise \nabsent authorial presence. (Skeggs 2004) is concerned that reflexivity offers \nlittle more than another recuperation of class, the re-making of working class \nidentities in the image of bourgeois sensibilities of \u2018self-possession\u2019. \nReflexivity is criticised by Skeggs (2004: 128) for providing a simple panacea \nthat glosses an uncritical reading of power at work in the making of \u2018selves\u2019, \nas if \u2019the problems of power, privilege and perspective can be dissolved by \ninserting one\u2019s self into the account and proclaiming therefore that reflexivity \nwas practiced; where, in fact, it was just talking about one\u2019s own experience \nfrom one\u2019s own perspective.\u2019  \n \nFor us the attraction of reflexivity lies not in confessional or testimonial \nexhortation but in its capacity to acknowledge researchers as active \nparticipants whose identities, like those of research subjects, may be variously \nshaped by powerful hierarchies of race\/ethnicity, gender and class.

Reflexivity offers a \nguide to sociological practice somewhat immunized against \u2018the single, \ncentral, dominant\u2026, quasi-divine, point of view that is all too easily adopted \nby observers\u2019 (Bourdieu 1999: 3).  \n \nPositionality and Prison Ethnography \n \nBeing granted access to two prisons and being welcomed by prison \nGovernors, despite the inclusion of a former prisoner (Rod) in the research \nteam, contrasts starkly with the situation in the US where prison \nethnographies are rarely conducted and even more rarely institutionally \nembraced (Wacquant 2002, Simon 2000, Morgan 2002). In Canada too, West \n(cited in Comack 2008: 13) indicates that as prison populations there rise to \nunprecedented levels there is an \u2018astounding dearth of empirically grounded, \ndescriptive material on how prisoners in Canadian penitentiaries actually \nlive, experience, understand and organize their lives\u2019. Even if, in the past, \nprison research in the UK has been far from free of institutional obstruction \n(Cohen and Taylor 1981), the more recent research environment \naccompanying the relentless growth of the domestic prison population has \nbeen nothing if not commensurate. The North American scenario seems \nremote in comparison to the many, varied and fine-grained accounts of \ncontemporary penal interiors in the UK.    \n \nNonetheless, these insightful studies often present accounts of relatively \nanonymous, albeit sympathetic, Outsiders looking in, as if their positionality \nand biographies were marginal to the perspectives they generate. There is \nobviously a degree of inevitability of Outsider status in prison ethnographies, \nbut methodological accounts of the research process tend to be confined to \nafterwords or appendices, rather than embedded in the ethnographic text \n(Pickering 2001 but see Bosworth 1999). In one of the most recent, \ncomprehensive and rich accounts of prison life, Crewe (2009: 488) indicates a \n\u2018reluctance to foreground myself in the analysis, not because my identity was \nirrelevant to the study, but because my identity was not what the study was \nabout.\u2019 While this is suggestive of the dualism that polarizes subjectivity \nagainst objective method, we do not want to deny the difficulties of reflexivity \nfor the lone prison researcher. Much of the approach we develop in this paper \narises from circumstantial opportunities that continually exposed the \nsignificance of the class, ethnicity and gender differences we explore here, but \nthese may be less accessible for a lone researcher. Moreover, we have been \nField Code Changed\nField Code Changed\nField Code Changed\nField Code Changed\nField Code Changed\nField Code Changed\nDeleted: Researcher 2\nDeleted: (2009:xxx)\n 5\npersuaded by Duneier\u2019s (2004: 103) suggestion to take as our starting point \nthat \u2018a different social position can have a serious effect on one\u2019s work, and \none can do better work by taking them very seriously.\u2019 \n \nMethodological and Analytical Approach \nOur study of Rochester Young Offenders\u2019 Institution and Maidstone Category \nC Prison in Kent, South-East England set out to explore neglected questions of \nhow ethnicity and identity shape the social relations of sentenced men in \nprison.  It involved two eight-month periods of fieldwork, between 2006 and \n2008, in which we spent time among prisoners on the wings, in workshops \nand education classes, and during association, sports, visits and worship. \nSemi-structured interviews were also conducted with 110 prisoners. Slightly \nover half the sample was drawn from contacts made during observational \nwork and the remainder were randomly selected from the prison roll, in both \ncases stratified to reflect the demographics of the prison population in relation \nto ethnicity, nationality and faith.  \n \nIn this paper we attempt to illustrate the significance of the self to prison \nethnography, by highlighting the ways in which our biographical histories \nand composite identities directly affected field relationships and interactions, \nbut were also inherently implicated in the analysis and writing stages of our \nresearch study. We have been convinced by Holland\u2019s (2007: 201) argument  \nthat our emotional experiences, memory, and subjectivity are inextricably \nentwined with the field, the prisoners\u2019 social world. As Walkerdine et al. \n(2001) assert, our thoughts and feelings about research participants and the \nresearch process should not be neglected or suppressed because they provide \na lens through which to understand our data, particularly when informed by \npsychoanalytic concepts (see also Gelsthorpe 2007).  \n \nOur approach has also been influenced by Hollway and Jefferson\u2019s (2000) \ninvitation to reject the traditional ethnographer\u2019s belief that their text simply \n\u2018tells it as it is\u2019, instead seeking to understand the impact of defences against \nanxiety which affect research subjects\u2019 stories and their interpretation by \nresearchers. These defences occur, often at an unconscious level, to protect the \nindividual from painful emotional conflict. Hollway and Jefferson\u2019s approach \nto the study of fear of crime attempted to uncover contradictions, \ninconsistencies and \u2018irrational\u2019 explanations by taking account of researchers\u2019 \nanxieties, internal fantasies and feelings.  \n \nPrisons are places of intensely managed emotions where institutional interests \nin formal order coincide and conflict with the raw exigencies of ontological \nsurvival in an alien and austere environment (cf. Cohen and Taylor 1981).

We \nhave, however, been \npersuaded by \nDeleted: in terms\nDeleted:  of\n 6\nlimited privacy, have to be endured daily by prisoners. It is therefore to be \nexpected that anxiety defences are mutually at play for both researchers \nentering this world from the relative comforts of life outside, and prisoners \nthemselves. Our fieldnotes record and reveal anxieties and defences, \nsometimes breached, sometimes only recognised in hindsight.   \n \nWalkerdine et al.\u2019s  (2001) ethnography of young women\u2019s lives engaged with \na similar emotional hinterland and developed a three-tier psycho-social \nanalysis we have found helpful to adopt in our prison study. They identified \nthe effects of gender and class operating at three discrete but contiguous \nlevels. Firstly, their Face Value Analysis examined girls\u2019 stories for the plot, \nevents and characters. Secondly, they analysed the Unconscious Subject \nelements of the girls\u2019 talk, focusing on projections, introjections, transferences, \nand omissions, silences, and contradictions. These refer to a variety of \n\u2018psychic defences\u2019 which protect the individual from consciously \nacknowledging anxious and painful feelings. They may be, instead, \nexternalized and projected onto another individual (\u2018projection\u2019), internalized \nthrough the actions of others (\u2018introjection\u2019), pushed onto the researcher who \nexperiences them directly (\u2018transference\u2019), excluded altogether (\u2018omission\u2019) or \nreferred to in contradictory ways. Cumulatively or specifically, the effect of \nthese defences is to remove aspects of experience to a more invisible, \nunconscious, level where they remain largely unexplored. The third level, \nconsidered the impact of Researcher-Subject Unconscious Dynamics by \ninterrogating the effects of the researchers\u2019 subjectivities on interpreting the \ngirls\u2019 narratives.  \n \nWe attempt, albeit without psychoanalytical training, to apply this analytical \nframework, and the ideas of Hollway and Jefferson (2000), to prisoners\u2019 \nnarratives, using two case studies. Our case studies are intended to place in \nthe foreground the co-construction of our account of men\u2019s lives inside \nprison, the co-presence of ourselves, and the men we interviewed. The case \nstudies we present here are not exceptional cases, and neither can they be \ntaken as necessarily representative (Gomm et al. 2000). The case study \napproach we have adopted here allows for the \u2018working through of the \nentirety and complexity of the data as it applies to very particular contexts\u2019 \n(Gadd and Jefferson 2007a: 6). This commitment to exploring complexity in \ncontext is implicitly less conducive to the discussion of a wider sample of \ncases. The two selected cases were chosen because each presented us with \nalmost unavoidable, prima facie, issues around ethnicity which surfaced \ndifferently for each researcher. A case study approach allowed us to subject \nthese issues of apparently reading differences differently to greater scrutiny. \n \nField Code Changed\nField Code Changed\nDeleted: interrogat\n 7\nUsing contemporaneous notes on each interview, together with subsequent  \nreflective post-transcription summaries prepared by both members of the \nresearch team, we have sought to expose, by exchanging notes, discussion, \nand recorded co-interviews, how the understandings we make of the \nidentities and interactions of these prisoners are contingent upon our own \nbiographies. Foremost among these are the way polarities of class (\u2018working \nclass\u20191\/middle class), ethnicity (black\/mixed race2\/white) and gender \n(female\/male) wove unexpected patterns for Coretta and Rod in the research \nprocess. We stress these positionalities not as essentialised or fixed differences \nbut as methodologically significant ones.  They are rendered unusual in a \nresearch setting by socio-structural factors that make the second researcher \n(white, male, middle class) a common-place in prison research and the first \n(black\/mixed race, female, working class) almost an exception, particularly \nwith regard to ethnicity.  \n \nThe reader will need to decide whether we avoid the damning indictment of \nself-indulgence and narcissism which are often levelled at such \u2018confessional \naccounts\u2019 (see for example Lofland and Lofland 1995). However, it is worth \nnoting the intellectual difficulty that we each experienced in thinking \nreflexively and being self-aware, not least because our training led us to flinch \nfrom critically examining and sharing our \u2018identity stories\u2019, which can \nunflatteringly reveal our anxieties, personal traumas, and shortcomings as \nhuman beings and as academic researchers. Nevertheless, we were compelled \nto recognise that a study of prisoner identities could not be divorced from some \nreflection on our own identities.  \n \nReflexively Understanding the Multicultural Prison \n \n\u2018Identity Stories\u2019 in the Field \nAs with any research study, we gathered fieldwork stories which revealed a \nbroad spectrum of emotions based on interactions with prisoners, prison \nofficers, administrators, and the prison itself.  The troubling nature of prison \nethnographic practice has been vividly described in the accounts of seasoned \nprison researchers such as Liebling (1999, 2001), King (2000) and Bosworth \n(1999)3, so here the focus is on gendered, racialised and classed experiences, \nas well as those relating to our biographical histories.  \n                                                 \n1 For Coretta, this is deemed to be largely residual, based on childhood and young adult \nexperiences. \n \n2  Of White (Jewish) and Nigerian ethnicities. \n \n3 What Bosworth (1999: 73) calls the \u2018tyranny of intimacy\u2019 in prison ethnography was present \nin our study too. Prisoners\u2019 biographical accounts of violent beatings, neglectful and rejecting \nbehaviour by parents, bereavement, loss, and estrangement, were hard to hear, sad, and \nField Code Changed\nField Code Changed\nDeleted: Researcher 1\nDeleted: 2\nDeleted: Researcher 1\n 8\nHaving served a short custodial sentence in 1982 as a result of incautious \npolitical activity, Rod brought to the study memories of shared cell life in an \nunnervingly similar 19th century prison (HMP Norwich) during an earlier \nperiod of prison overcrowding. Disclosure of this experience was sometimes \nfraught with a fear that it might be seen as opportunistic, or seen to imply an \nunwarranted assumption of shared experiences. This reticence was \nparticularly strongly felt at HMYOI Rochester, where incarceration appeared \nto foster a kind of youthful machismo and a naive stress on masculine \nauthenticity that was difficult to share. However, sharing memories of cells \nwithout sanitation, television, or electronic games, or telephones on each wing \ncame easier among the older prisoners at HMP Maidstone. In general, Rod \nfound the research experience reanimated prison memories that were \npositive, negative and ambivalent but affirmed profound misgivings about \nprison\u2019s relationship to patriarchal society (Carlen 1983, Sabo et al. 2001). As \nBauman (1993: 122) notes, \u2019\u2026penal practice may serve as a laboratory where \nthe tendencies attenuated and adulterated elsewhere can be observed in their \npure form\u2019. In this sense, but without implying any equivalence, whether as a \nprisoner or a researcher, contact with prison can be a deeply unsettling \nexperience.  \n \nFor Coretta, the look of hostile incomprehension on a white administrator\u2019s \nface when she first saw a black\/mixed race woman with \u2018loxed\u2019 hair enter her \noffice, the tendency for some prison officers to primarily address Rod, the \nolder, white, male, but junior member of the research team, the implicit \nrefusal of black prisoners at HMP Maidstone to participate in an ethnically \nmixed group interview, and the more pernicious racist statements made in \ninterviews with Rod, were all indicative of gendered and racialised \nboundaries being erected in everyday life inside the prison4. Such \nmarginalising experiences are frequently reported in experiential accounts of \nempirical research involving minority ethnic and\/or female researchers (for a \n                                                                                                                                            \ndeeply troubling. Such intimate sharing of life experiences catapult you into another person\u2019s \nworld, creating an emotional, albeit often brief, closeness which can be unnerving in a culture \nwhere personal traumas are not typically shared with strangers. Whilst this can be seen as \n\u2018ultimately data, grist for the ethnographic mill\u2019, as Stacey (1988: 23), notes, this is \u2018a mill that \nhas a truly grinding power.\u2019 The reason such stories are told so readily in the prison context is \nprecisely because of the deeply isolated and emotionally vulnerable position that prisoners \nfind themselves in. The opportunity to offload, to engage with these feelings (buoyed by \nsome intrusive and piercing questions from the researcher) can hardly stop this venting \nprocess. That is why the \u2018good interview\u2019 producing \u2018good material\u2019 (clear answers to the key \nresearch questions and \u2018juicy quotes\u2019) can also be the ones that provoke the most pain in the \nresearcher, and uncomfortable feelings of exploitation and disloyalty. \n \n4  Of course, such racialising processes occur outside the prison too. During the study, Coretta \nwas mistaken for a cleaner by an academic researcher attending a residential ESRC \nconference and assumed to be a publishing assistant rather than an academic member at an \neditorial board meeting! \nFormatted: Font: Italic\nDeleted: \u00b6\nDeleted: Researcher 2\nDeleted: Researcher 2\nDeleted: (Carlen 1983; Sabo et \nal. 2000)\nDeleted: (1993:122)\nDeleted: :\nDeleted: \u201c\nDeleted: \u201c\nDeleted: Researcher 1\nDeleted: Researcher 2\nDeleted: the white researcher\nDeleted: Researcher 1\n 9\nrecent account see Maylor 2009). Their epistemological value, however, lies in \ntheir ability to remind us that race, class, and gender always matter. This is not \nto suggest that every encounter, frame by frame, is inscribed by inequality \nand hierarchy, but to underline that postcolonial times in contemporary \nBritain retain ugly imperial and colonial vestiges (Ali 2009). We should not be \nsurprised when they are part of the research process but nor should we \nrefrain from actively interrogating them.  \n \nIt was evident that the researchers\u2019 respective oscillating Insider and Outsider \nstatuses, and their subaltern\/superordinate positionalities proved both \nproductive and constraining. Coretta\u2019s interview of a Black British \n(Dominican) prisoner at HMP Maidstone was relaxed and emotionally \nintimate, and as the interview proceeded his talk was infused with Caribbean \nintonations and language (for example, the use of the term \u2018facety\u2019), \npresumably because of an assumption of a shared black ethnicity. Conversely, \non another occasion Coretta\u2019s interview with a mixed race prisoner may have \nbeen impeded by gender despite the anticipated benefits of a shared ethnicity. \nThe usual power dynamics of the interview were upturned, as Damian5  \nsubverted the conduct of the interview by insisting the meeting was more of \n\u2018a date\u2019. He resisted attempts to engage with the informed consent process or \nto respond to introductory questions. His refusal to answer any questions \ndirectly by responding \u2018I don\u2019t know, Miss, I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s a difficult \nquestion\u2019, or \u2018I don\u2019t care, I don\u2019t care\u2019, were experienced as a power play. \nDamian sought to deploy a gendered authority that prioritised sexual flirting, \nimplicitly positioning Coretta primarily as a sexualised gender subject. In \nexercising his power to withdraw his participation in the research in this \nmanner he also suggested the urgency of sensual denials in the prison \nenvironment. The points of meeting around shared ethnicity anticipated by \nCoretta were cancelled by the stereotypes of a gendered dynamic.  \n \nFor Rod his implicitly white perspectives were quickly exposed as he \nexplained the research objectives to a black prisoner in HMP Maidstone, as \nthe following fieldnote extract indicates: \nAt one point while I am talking about how we are interested in how \npeople mix in prison, he says \u2018just look at us. That is how mixed it is in \nprison. Prisons is full of all kinds of people from all over the world \u2013 look at us \nnow. Here I am \u2013 a Nigerian, and who am I with?

She noted cultural identification and familiarity as well \nas cultural strangeness and estrangement in Capital High School, where she \nexperienced a \u2018braiding\u2019 of childhood feelings associated with education and \ncontaining her racial and gendered self, with her professional status as an \nanthropologist. This revealed fears of misrepresentation, exploitation and \ncollusion, rather than the more common ethnographic fears of not \nestablishing a rapport. Such concerns were similarly recorded in Coretta\u2019s \npre-fieldwork notes. In a post-fieldwork co-interview, Coretta also accessed \ndeeply held negative feelings about experiencing violent racism as a child \nwhich contributed to the framing of the research study in Maidstone prison:  \nSome of these people [prisoners] look scary to me. Some of \nthem look like the stereotype of a kind of white racist thug.  \nAnd I found some of them quite frightening\u2026There\u2019s a kind of \nstyle and a countenance of a kind of older white man\u2026that I \nfind really quite frightening cos it takes me back to when I \nused to\u2026  I\u2019d be shouted at in the street, and I\u2019d be like racially \nabused, and it would always be by, you know, white men, \noften who were kind of bulked up, that were tattooed... It was \na kind of reminder of that\u2026  \n(Co-Interview, 8 May 2009). \n \nIn the following section we use two case studies to elaborate on how aspects \nof the positionalities and  biographical experiences outlined above converged \nto weave unexpected patterns in the fieldwork, analysis and theorisation.  \n  \nCase Study 1 - Anthony  \nAnthony was a white British prisoner from south east England serving a \nlengthy sentence for various serious offences. We met him very early in the \nstudy at HMP Maidstone, whilst being taken on a tour of one of the wings by \na white female prison officer. In our first encounter, Anthony was forthright, \nslightly aggressive, demanding information about the purposes of our study, \nseeming only partly convinced by Coretta\u2019s desire to underline the inclusive \nField Code Changed\nDeleted: Researcher 2\nDeleted: Researcher 1\nDeleted: Researcher 1\nDeleted:  \nDeleted:  So it kind of\u2026\nDeleted:  \nDeleted: 6\nDeleted: Researcher 1\n 11\nnature of the study\u2019s research questions concerned with examining ethnicity \nand not just  minority ethnic prisoner experience. Rod was unusually wary, \nreluctant to engage with him, picking up a \u2018bad vibe\u2019 from him. Coretta \nstruggled with the \u2018bogeyman\u2019 fear of \u2018his type\u2019. His \u2018shaved head, skinhead\u2019 \nappearance coupled with the St George\u2019s flag7  which hung in his cell \npredisposed her, initially, to see him as embodying the ardent  British \nnationalism, which at its zenith in the 1970s\/1980s, manifested in extensive \nracist and fascist violence. This emotional reaction conflicted directly with \nprofessional principles of resisting judgement of research subjects\u2019 attitudes \nand behaviour.  \n \nA couple of months later when Anthony agreed to become the first \ninterviewee at Maidstone, Coretta had mixed feelings about his preference to \nbe interviewed by her. It seemed to confirm earlier concerns, first registered \nwhile completing the ESRC outline funding bid that her racialised life \nexperiences might too readily provide the (biased?) lens through which she \napproached and engaged with social research questions. After all, Anthony \nhad chosen to be interviewed by the minority ethnic member of our research \nteam. More prosaically, however, there was the enormous relief that the all-\nimportant first interview had been secured. It was an engaging and extensive \ninterview, rich in material to address our research questions, and Coretta felt \nmore elated than exhausted  at the end of the four hours she spent with \nAnthony discussing his ethnic, masculine, religious and national identity, \nrelationships with family members and friends, drug use and supply in the \nprison, social hierarchies and prisoner and officer racism. \n \nAt the first level of Walkerdine et al.\u2019s (2001) analysis, taken at face value, \nAnthony\u2019s narrative provided a series of stories about his troubled home life, \nas well as some reflections on his twenty year mid-level drug supply \nbusiness. The interview moved into emotionally intimate territory, and \nCoretta warmed to Anthony as he expressed deep love and responsibility for \nhis son, and later described the difficult relationship he had had with his wife \nduring and after their marriage, and with two other intimates.  \n \nFocusing here specifically on the interview as it addressed prisoner ethnic and \nsocial relations, superficially at least, Anthony presented  a benign account \nwhich persuasively supported Gilroy\u2019s (2004) notion of \u2018convivial \nmulticulture\u2019 with no immediate hint of the associated melancholia. His talk - \n\u2018I know a few Indian birds and all that\u2026there\u2019s no problem with me\u2019 - was of \n                                                 \n7 Only later in discussion with a race equality professional did it occur to Coretta that there \nmight be an ulterior motive in the white prison officer taking us into a cell in which the St \nGeorge\u2019s flag was displayed, given its\u2019 historical symbolism as an emblem of the openly racist \nelements of British nationalism. \nField Code Changed\nDeleted: Researcher 2\nDeleted: Researcher 1\nDeleted: Researcher 1\nDeleted: Researcher 1\nDeleted: Researcher 1\nDeleted: Researcher 1\nDeleted: and fascist \n 12\ngetting on well with \u2018black geezers\u2019, hanging out in the cells with a \u2018bunch of \ndreads\u2019, listening to Gregory Isaacs8, and expressing disgust at the bigotry of \na prison officer whose \u2018motto\u2019 in relation to black people \u2018running the wings\u2019 \nwas \u2018to fuck \u2018em off out of the country\u2019 (Interview, 25 July 2007). Anthony \ndisplayed much of the sentiment of Rochester prisoners who had, rather \nsuperficially, described diversity in the prison social world as unproblematic \nand unremarkable (Phillips, 2008), representing the prison as a social space in \nwhich there was harmonious ethnic co-existence.  \n \nReturning to the interview transcript some time after the interview was \nconducted allowed an exploration of the words and images Anthony had \nused, as indicated in Walkerdine et al.\u2019s (2001) second level of analysis. It was \nevident in the re-reading that Anthony\u2019s narrative drew on a repertoire of \ncoded \u2018race talk\u2019 that was rooted in racialised contexts in which black cultural \ninferiority was frequently inscribed. His reference points \u2013 army racism in \ncolonial contexts, his father\u2019s black friend and his \u2018beautiful daughters\u2019, \nprison officers\u2019 racism \u2013 all displayed the familiar hallmarks of ambivalence, \ncontradiction, and sexualised objectification documented in accounts of \nracialisation (Nayak 2005, Rattansi 2005). In other instances his talk reflected \nthe incompatibility in his mind of the \u2018dreads\u2019 being Englishmen, and their \ninability to talk English rather than their often indecipherable patois. He \npointedly reveals in the interview his violent reputation on the wing which is \nupheld when the black prisoners, initially laughing at him, are \u2018wrapped up\u2019 \nby him. This seems to attest to his need to handle himself physically against \neven the tougher black prisoners, perhaps an attempt to reinsert his superior \nposition in the wing social hierarchy. Anthony also describes his ongoing and \nunproblematic friendships with \u2018proper racists\u2019 - prisoners who express \novertly racist views. Such paradoxical incongruities have been similarly \nremarked upon by Back (2002: 36), recalling his interview in a Mexican \nrestaurant of British National Party leader Nick Griffin, an affirmed \nMuhammed Ali admirer. \n \nAt the same time, Anthony makes reference to the loyalty shown to him by \nblack prisoners who vouch for his anti-racism and he convincingly argues for \nnon-Muslim prisoners to respect Muslim prisoners\u2019 need to cook halal food \nuncontaminated by pork products in the self-cook area of the prison. \nMoreover, Anthony refrained from criticising the dominance of black \nprisoners on the \u2018rings\u2019 in the self-cook area, explicitly rejecting the plaintive \nvictimisation rhetoric of some white prisoners: \n \n \n                                                 \n8 A renowned reggae\/lovers rock artist, popular in the 1970s-1990s. \nField Code Changed\nField Code Changed\nDeleted:  (XXX, 2008)\n 13\nLike they all moan about the blacks going on the cookers, \nalways taking over\u2026 so fucking what, at the end of the \nday\u2026This is me right, this is me.  I don\u2019t care who you are, I\u2019m \nhaving that ring, you know what I mean, you\u2019re not having \ntwo rings because that\u2019s being greedy, I want that ring\u2026They \n[black prisoners] respect me more for doing that than standing \nin the corner waiting, do you understand?  \n(Interview, 25 July 2007). \n \nAnthony also resisted expressing conventional \u2018race card resentment\u2019 when \nreflecting on the prison administration\u2019s reluctance to allow him to display his \nEngland colours shortly before the football World Cup in 2006. Tellingly, he \nrecounted being publicly criticised in a meeting which included members of \nthe Board of Visitors, suggesting that he had been the victim of prejudice \nagainst his self-professed  \u2018Orangeman\u20199 identity. His complaint was of the \nsuppression of his assertion of a distinctive white cultural identity and it \ncontrasted sharply with the views of a significant number of white prisoners \nfor whom the very idea of a white cultural identity was alien and \ndisorienting.   \n \nTo borrow from Back (2002: 57), Anthony then, was neither \u2018anti-racist angel\u2019 \nnor \u2018rotten-to-the-core \u2018racist devil\u2019. It is this which is revealing of ethnic and \nsocial relations in men\u2019s prisons at a time when multiculturalism is both \npractised and problematised in contemporary discourses. It reveals the \ncomplexities of racialised identities, both white and black, that stand in \ncontradistinction to the two dimensional \u2018look-at-the-racists-freak show\u2019 \nfavoured by the media and some elements of the anti-racist movement (Hage \n2000). That Anthony could move relatively comfortably among the black and \nMuslim prisoners at Maidstone as well as the white \u2018proper racists\u2019 is also an \nindication of the uneasy and messy nature of \u2018living diversity\u2019 in the early 21st \ncentury (Gilroy 2004). It can also be seen as representing the Janus-faced \nquality of racism referred to by Gunaratnam and Lewis (2001), also signified \nin Back\u2019s (2009: 209) astute observation that the \u2018fact of multiculture is all \naround us and yet it remains elusive\u2019. Hage (2000:18), for example, \nemphasises that there is a regressive \u2018white multiculturalism\u2019 which is  \n\u2018oblivious to its own positionality\u2019, but nonetheless viable for white people to \noperationalise in various reactionary contexts. \n \n                                                 \n9 The Orange Order, an Ulster Protestant group established in1795, is almost exclusively and \nheavily associated with the British colonial project in Ireland. Though it has \u2018Lodges\u2019 in other \nformer British colonies, such as Canada and West Africa, it is almost entirely composed of \nwhite men. In Ireland it is heavily implicated in sustaining the cultural trappings of British \nloyalist ascendancy and sectarianism (Bell 1978).  \nField Code Changed\nField Code Changed\nField Code Changed\nDeleted: (XXXX 2008) \n 14\nAt the third level of Walkerdine et al.\u2019s (2001) analysis was the role of \nunconscious researcher-subject dynamics. These came to be scrutinised in the \nsubsequent discussion between the researchers which sought to interpret \nAnthony\u2019s narrative, and understand more about the contemporary dynamics \nof ethnicity, nationality and racism in prison. The warmth that Coretta felt \ntowards Anthony also reflected an implicit empathy, borne out of a[n ex-] \nworking class alignment. There was thus an emotional recognition of a shared \nclass heritage but also a different life trajectory ( a kind of \u2018there but for the \ngrace of God go I\u2019). This was further underlined by Coretta\u2019s exposure to a \nsmall number of relatives\u2019 and friends\u2019 imprisonment. Other points of \nidentification connected with Coretta\u2019s growing up in the same decades as \nAnthony, and as a parent concerned with their child\u2019s welfare. These class, \nage and parental affinities represented the possibilities of shared experience, \nempathy, providing the opportunity of being an informed listener (Hollway \nand Jefferson 2000), but their limits and tensions must also be acknowledged \n(Back 1993). \n \nAt the unconscious level of researcher-subject interactions, Walkerdine et al. \n(2001: 97) contend that it is \u2018being aware of and listening to the different parts \nof our own psyches, and to the place in us that responded to a given message, \nthat allowed us to tune into the different meanings of our subjects.\u2019 This self-\nconscious engagement can be challenging. Barely registering in Coretta\u2019s \nmind during the interview with Anthony was his tales of participating in \narmed Loyalist marches in Northern Ireland. By contrast, in transcript, this \nstruck a chord with Rod who, in subsequent case-study reflections, denoted \nhimself as the \u2018mirror image\u2019 of Anthony, having himself been involved in \nIrish republican marches there in the 1970s and 1980s. For Rod, Anthony\u2019s \naccount revealed ardent commitment to violent fascistic, racist, and \nnationalistic tendencies which were probably only partly a product of his \nmid-level involvement in the shadowy economy of the illicit drug markets \noccupied by Irish paramilitaries. Whilst interviewing Anthony might have \nproved uncomfortable for Rod, as they ironically shared much that could not \nbe shared easily, Rod\u2019s Anglo-Irish heritage subsequently provided a window \ninto Anthony\u2019s national\/religious identity which was emotionally closed and \nexperientially remote to Coretta.  \n \nIn this interview extract, Coretta\u2019s follow-up questions picked up an earlier \ntheme of Muslim prisoners rather than more directly interrogating Anthony\u2019s \nidentification with northern Irish political and religious sensibilities, leaving \nhis white ethnicity and identification with Ulster Loyalism relatively \nunexplored: \n \n \nField Code Changed\nDeleted: Researcher 1\nDeleted: Researcher 1\nDeleted: Researcher 1\nDeleted: Researcher 1\nDeleted: Researcher 2\nDeleted: Researcher 2\nDeleted: Researcher 2\nDeleted: Researcher 2\nDeleted: Researcher 1\nDeleted: Researcher 1\n 15\nAnthony: All right I\u2019ve been on marches over there, loads of \nmarches, alright\u2026 you know, we\u2019ve got a UVF10 and all that \nalright, yeah.  But we don\u2019t class ourselves as terrorists or \nanything like that, do you understand, we just class ourselves \nas putting the fact right, you know what I mean.  Yeah, it\u2019s a \nBritish\u2026 we\u2019re British, you know, put it right.

(Duneier 2004: 101; cf. Back 2002). This selective filtering, or denial \nin psychoanalytic terms, can perhaps be seen as a psychic defence against \nanxiety, as Coretta sought to avoid revisiting the hurt and anger which was \nexperienced as a child victim of violent racism (Bowling 1999). As Hunt (1989: \n27) suggests, \u2018certain behaviours engaged in during fieldwork may involve a \nrepetition in action of repressed memories and unconscious fantasies\u2019. It was \nseemingly psychically easier for Coretta to position Anthony as adopting the \n\u2018harmony discourse\u2019 (Back 1996), of representing positive inter-ethnic \nrelations, unmarred by racialising tendencies, reflecting childhood fantasies \nwhich were far removed from the presence of the extreme racism of the 1970s \nand 1980s. It reflected a need to repress the threatening possibility of Anthony \nrepresenting the embodiment of the white racist working class bogey-man, \nand project on to him an emblem of living diversity, allowing her to thus \nrelinquish anxious feelings about doing research in a Kentish prison11. In this \nsense, the case study exemplifies the significance of psycho-social \nunderstandings which recognise psychological defensiveness within specific \n                                                 \n10 Ulster Volunteer Force, an illegal loyalist paramilitary group that actively fostered links \nwith British fascist organisations from the 1980s onwards, and was heavily implicated in \nillicit drug markets . \n11  Such anxieties may have been heightened by Coretta\u2019s domestic plans to move out of \nmulticultural London into the suburbs. \nField Code Changed\nField Code Changed\nField Code Changed\nField Code Changed\nDeleted: Researcher 1\nDeleted: (XXX)\nDeleted: Researcher 1\nDeleted: Researcher 1\nDeleted: Researcher 1\nDeleted: Researcher 1\n 16\nsocial and cultural contexts, an approach gaining some recognition in \ncontemporary in criminology  (see for example Gadd and Jefferson 2007b).  \n \nCase Study 2 \u2013 Warren  \nWarren, one of the older white prisoners at Maidstone, was on nodding terms \nwith Rod and, having been randomly selected, agreed to be interviewed in his \ncell. Rod reports in his field journal feeling frustrated and discomfited by the \ninterview. Warren revealed a complex life-history involving extensive travel \nfrom homes in Essex, London, and Zimbabwe, where he lived for 18 years. In \nthe early stages of the interview he explained his South African accent as \nderiving from the speaking of \u2018Dutch\u2019 which he declined to refer to as \nAfrikaans because, as he put it in interview, \u2018Afrikaans is a bastardised \nversion of Dutch in my opinion\u2019.  \n \nSeeking insights into his domestic and personal life proved difficult as \nWarren reported relatively unconventional family arrangements involving a \nsequence of intimate relations, and in one case marriage, to three sisters. The \nexistence of three children from the marriage featured less prominently than \nan amusing series of anecdotes about their mother\u2019s predilection for keeping \nup to 28 cats in the family home.    \nAt face value, the first tier of Walkerdine\u2019s psycho-social schematic, the \ninterview presented a complex and tangled narrative reflecting the difficulty \nof conveying the experiences of a full and longer life under the limitations of a \nformatted interview.     \n \nRod\u2019s subsequent reflections on the interview, corresponding to Walkerdine \net al.\u2019s (2001) second level (Unconscious Subject) analysis, indicate a concern \nabout Warren\u2019s repeated evasions and discrete codifications of \u2018race\u2019 in the \ninterview. The sense of ambiguity and difficulty in the interview condensed \naround a brief exchange where it seemed the tables were turned on Rod and \nhis national identity (Irish) became the object of Warren\u2019s interrogation. The \nreversal of roles occurred as the interview schedule broached the subject of \nethnicity, as reproduced here with some additional annotations and elisions:   \nRod.: Um, the idea of sort of ethnic identity, this idea that, you know, \nthere is peoples with all sorts of backgrounds, heritages, experiences, \nand you know, sharing sort of space in\u2026[here I was going to say \u2018prison\u2019] \nWarren:  On our small island [laughs]. \n\u2026\/\/\u2026 \nRod: But what about, I mean which ethnic group do you tend to say \nyou belong to when you\u2026? \nWarren: I\u2019m a white Englishman. \n\u2026\/\/\u2026 \nField Code Changed\nDeleted: Researcher 2\nDeleted: Researcher 2\nDeleted: Researcher 2\nDeleted: Researcher 2\nDeleted: Researcher 2\nDeleted: Researcher 2\n 17\nRod: I mean one of the ways sometimes of feeling more, I mean, I don\u2019t \nfeel particularly sort of British in Britain kind of thing, but if I\u2019m on \nholiday with my kids I feel much more conscious of being British.  I \ndon\u2019t know if that\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s only when you were in um say Zimbabwe \nyou felt, sort of, that was a different thing?  Again you know, you \nmight have felt more white there, I don\u2019t know? \nWarren: A lot of the Zimbabweans were actually ex patriots [unclear \u2013\ntalking together]. But um if I may ask you a question from your last \nstatement, why do you not feel as British as you might feel in your own \ncountry? What would be the reason for that?  Because of the influx of \nmany other peoples? \nRod: Um, no I mean because I\u2019ve got an Irish passport so\u2026 \nWarren: Are you from Ireland yourself? \nRod: Well my father is from Ireland you see, so yeah, that sense, you \nknow, although probably anybody here\u2026 \nWarren: When you say Ireland I presume you\u2019re talking about Eire, \nsouthern Ireland? \n\u2026\/\/\u2026 \nRod: Yeah, yeah.  So that would be that sense although people would \nhear my voice and they\u2019d say he\u2019s English, he\u2019s\u2026 you know, I don\u2019t \nhave a trace of an Irish accent. \n\u2026\/\/\u2026 \nWarren: I don\u2019t care what clan you belong to, you\u2019re a foreigner \n[laughs]. \nRod: Yeah, well that\u2019s partly the thing you know, so I\u2019ve lived in \nBritain all my life, you know\u2026 \nWarren:  Sure.  I hope we\u2019ve made you welcome [laughs]. \n \nRod found this section of the interview unsettling in the way that it seemed to \nconfirm the suspicions he had of Warren\u2019s dissembling with respect to \u2018race\u2019. \nKey words and phrases of the white Anglo-ethnic majority  lexicon such as \n\u2018small island\u2019, \u2018foreign\u2019 and welcoming \u2018guests\u2019 appeared to imprint Rod with \nthe characteristics that Warren needed to \u2018other\u2019 him, and convey an implicit \nauthority over him in this process. The subversion of the interview \nconvention was also playful, but the humour was experienced as having an \nunpleasant edge. At one level it signalled Warren\u2019s refusal to \u2018play by the \nrules\u2019 or engage with the subject matter of the research, as can happen in any \ninterview, and at another  there was the deployment of an apparently \u2018trump \ncard\u2019, white Englishness, which leant weight and exclusionary menace to the \nsubversion. Every interview involves a performance from both sides but in \nthis interview the performance became more self-conscious, more of an ethnic \nmasquerade in which Rod\u2019s suspicions of Warren\u2019s ethnicity were met with \nDeleted: Researcher 2\nDeleted: .\nDeleted: Researcher 2\nDeleted: Researcher 2\nDeleted: Researcher 2\nDeleted: Researcher 2\nDeleted: Researcher 2\nDeleted: Researcher 2\nDeleted: Researcher 2\n 18\nWarren\u2019s of Rod\u2019s. As Rod notes in subsequent reflections \u2018no meeting \nground found, a chasm opened\u2019. \n \nThe third level of analysis suggested by Walkerdine et al. (2001), Researcher-\nSubject Unconscious Dynamics, indicate that Researchers 2\u2019s interactions with \nWarren may have been complicated by the baggage, in his mind, \naccompanying his respondent\u2019s  accent, namely those associated with the \nwhite supremacist regimes of pre-independence Zimbabwe and apartheid-era \nSouth Africa. In addition, Warren\u2019s firm avowal of a straightforward English \nnational identity and his disavowal of antagonism toward minority ethnic \ngroups were experienced as a psychic challenge to Rod\u2019s assumptions, \nparticularly when his ambivalence toward his own national identity was \nexposed. Warren\u2019s insistence on strong, rooted, identification with place, his \nEast London working class heritage, also potentially antagonised Rod\u2019s sense \nof personal displacement, of being neither English nor Irish, and white middle \nclass rootlessness.  \n  \nThese dynamics appear quite specific to the white ethnicities represented in \nthe interview, those of a white, working class Englishman and a white, \nmiddle class Anglo-Irishman. Although in the empirical sense they appear to \nshut down the mutual exploration of ethnicity, they open up in the theoretical \nsense the importance of interrogating white and colonial sensibilities around \nthe question of English nationality, and Anglo-ethnic indeterminacy, why it \ntends to elicit tension, evasiveness, defensiveness, anger and \nincomprehension (Mac an Ghaill 1999).  Understanding white identities as \nhaving distinctive characteristics of their own that will flow through the \nresearch process, rather than operating as a passive backdrop to other \nracialised identities more commonly scrutinised in criminological research \ninvolves unpicking the \u2018empty\u2019 monolithic status of a singular \u2018invisible\u2019 \n\u2018whiteness\u2019.  White men are not inoculated at birth from the political and \neconomic forces that seem to shape other racialised and gendered identities \nand establishing their contours in research removes the privilege of absence \nthey currently enjoy. As Gallagher (2000 : 84) remarks \u2018[D]ata does not \u2018speak \nfor itself\u2019, nor does it emerge in a vacuum. Who we are (and who we appear \nto be in a specific context) influences the questions we ask, the responses we \nget and the scholarship we produce\u2019.  To repeat Walkerdine et al.\u2019s (2001) \nsuggestion \u2018being aware of and listening to the different parts of our own \npsyches, and to the place in us that responds to a given message\u2026 allow[s] us \nto tune in to the different meanings of our subjects\u2019.   \n \n \n \n \nField Code Changed\nField Code Changed\nDeleted: Researcher 2\nDeleted: Researcher 2\nDeleted: ethnic minorities\nDeleted: Researcher 2\nDeleted: Researcher 2\n 19\nOur Lives\/Prisoners\u2019 Lives: Co-Constructed Knowledge Production \n \nEthnographic writing is not cultural reportage, but cultural construction, and always a \nconstruction of self as well as of the other. (Stacey 1988: 24) \n \nIt is sobering to read Bennett\u2019s (1981) account of \u2018the rhetoric of criminology\u2019, \nnot least because he made very similar suggestions after reviewing the \n\u2018ethnographic greats\u2019 of Chicago-era criminology, such as Clifford Shaw\u2019s The \nJack Roller, to those we are now making. Notwithstanding the recent special \nissue of Theoretical Criminology (Volume 11 Issue 4) on this topic it is not hard \nto recognise a contemporary resonance in Bennett\u2019s (1981: 248) observation \nthat: \nAlthough these criminologists see themselves as scientists \nworking in a micro-analytical tradition, they apparently \nassume that developing a personal relationship with a \ndelinquent and transmitting urgent messages to an audience \nare more important than analyzing the many small causes that \ninfluence the acquisition and publication of those messages \u2013 \nmore important than giving an autobiographical account of \nthemselves\u2026   \n \nThis paper has attempted to take on this challenge, recognising that \ninterrogating what Gelsthorpe (2007: 518 ) refers to as the biographical \n\u2018underside\u2019 of the ethnographic research process can enhance our \nunderstanding of sociological stories (see also Reiner 1998). Our contention is \nthat we must be wary of a tendency toward sociologically \u2018airbrushed\u2019 \naccounts, cosmetically enhanced for objectivity in which the awkwardness of \nthe construction is consigned to a methodological  afterword. This practice \nbrackets away the subjectivity inherent in human interaction, disguising and \ndiminishing its\u2019 role in the production of criminological knowledge. As \nLiebling (1999: 160) states, in the prison, \u2018[w]e see, observe, but inwardly \n(subjectively) digest scenes and encounters; our inner lives interplaying with \nthe lives of others\u2019, and yet the final accounts of prison ethnographies rarely \ndwell on that interplay. Methodologically, we need to be alert to the ways in \nwhich we may distort, misrepresent, or have subjects\u2019 experiences obscured \nfrom view because of our biographical experiences or subjectivities. One of the \nkey benefits then, of a reflexive interrogation of positionality and subjectivity, \nis to make more transparent the interpretive process.  \n \nUndoubtedly, the configuration of our \u2018mixed\u2019 research team, with its \nclassically categorical subaltern and superordinate identities and biographical \nhistories, enabled us to actively probe these processes more directly than \nmight be ordinarily possible in much criminological research, including that \nField Code Changed\nField Code Changed\nField Code Changed\nField Code Changed\n 20\nundertaken in prisons. Our embodiment as gendered, classed and racialised \nresearchers, meant that it was all but impossible to follow the tendency of a \n\u2018regression to the (white, male, middle class) mean\u2019 that effaces such \nhierarchies. The circumstances this embodiment generated, that we have \noutlined briefly in this article, propelled us toward reflexivity. It operated \nagainst fully relinquishing Insider and Outsider positions, but our identity \npolarities presented us with opportunities to triangulate interpretations, \nrather than relying, unreflexively, on a singular positional  perspective. As \nBourdieu (1999: 615) warns, the \u2018simple virtue of reflexivity\u2019 cannot \ncompletely \u2018control the multiple and complex effects of the interview \nrelationship\u2019 but it both contributes to, and exposes, a mutual resistance to the \nimplicit objectification that occurs in ethnography.  This has the potential to \nlead to appreciative and rounded insights more faithful both to the \ncomplexities of prison life and the research process (Liebling 1999).  \n \nFurthermore, in reframing Liebling\u2019s (2001) call to study subordinates \n(prisoners) and superordinates (officers\/Governors) in prison research, we \nargue for greater inclusion of the positional subjectivities of the researchers, as \nwell as those of the subaltern and marginalised prisoners. Situating ourselves \nmore explicitly within the co-construction of prison worlds can provide an \nopportunity to disrupt the dehumanising othering that is prison\u2019s principal \nsocial accomplishment. Doing so might produce accounts which amount to \nmore than \u2018a report from behind bars\u2019 of \u2018unfortunate others\u2019. Situating \nresearcher\u2019s biographies and experiences more centrally in the analysis can \nperhaps help expose and breach a dynamic that however unintentionally \nreproduces the \u2018othering\u2019 functions of prison. In popular culture the \nspectacular \u2018othering\u2019 of prison and prisoners substitutes for, and obscures, its \nbanality and its grinding dullness, distancing people from responsibility for \nits more mundane realities. This is not to suggest a simplistic political \nsolidarity with men and women \u2018behind bars\u2019 is either possible or necessary \nfor criminological researchers, but registers the profound ethical ambiguities \nof conducting such research.  \n \nThere is an urgency to tell the tale of the burgeoning prison population and its \nattendant dehumanisation, but incorporating research subjectivity need not \ndetract from this task, and can enhance it.  Pyscho-social attention to the \nparticular, the personal and the hidden fosters an \u2018interpretive approach that \nis sensitive to the inconsistencies in the way people behave toward others and \ntalk about themselves\u2019 (Gadd and Jefferson 2007:184).  In this we echo the plea \nin Walkerdine et al. (2001:88) for a \u2018third space\u2019 in which \u2018the social, cultural \nand psychic are researched together\u2019 rather than held apart.   This is all the \nmore necessary given the comparative dearth of such approaches in prison \nethnographies and criminological research more generally. It is rendered \nDeleted: As such, our \ncriticism of earlier prison \nethnographic work, such as \nCrewe (2009) may be \nmisplaced. \nDeleted: 6\n 21\nmore urgent by the growth of what Bourdieu (1999:618) initially characterised \nas \u2018tape-recorder sociology\u2019, and what Back (2007), more recently, sees as \n\u2018fast-food\u2019, sound-bite sociology. The aim of this article has been to draw \nattention to the methodological and epistemological contours of prison \nresearch, its complexities and the opportunities for verstehen. Using two case \nstudies and a psycho-social approach we have examined the ways in which \nour subjectivities inform, frame, and mediate relationships within the field, \nbut also are manifest at the interpretative and writing stages of prison \nethnographic work. Such an approach risks self-indulgence, but even for the \nsceptics, working in this manner can provide criminologists with a \u2018deeper \nunderstanding both of the conditions of existence of which they are a product \nand of the social effects that can be exercised by the research relationship\u2019 \n(Bourdieu 1999: 621).  \n \nDeleted:  Back (2007)\n 22\nReferences \n \nAlexander, C.
