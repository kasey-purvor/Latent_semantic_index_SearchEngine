In this paper I explore Mill's modest scepticism about \ninstitutional epistemology and compare and contrast that with the attitude of \nliberal theorists such as F.A. Hayek and John Dewey who are much more \nenthusiastic about the prospects of social epistemology as part of their \ndefences of liberalism. The paper examines the extent to which Hayek and \nDewey ignore concerns originally raised by Mill. I conclude that Mill's \nmodes scepticism is reflected in the epistemological abstinence of \ncontemporary liberal philosophers such as John Rawls, and that his elevation \nof philosophy over democracy remains a challenge to contemporary \ndefenders of the political value of social or institutional epistemology. \n \nIn whatever way contemporary liberalism seeks to abandon methods and \narguments posed by earlier thinkers it remains implicated in problems that \nwere raised in Mill\u2019s complex and pregnant writings of the mid nineteenth-\ncentury. Yet ever since the nineteenth century there have been liberals \nthinkers who cast doubts upon Mill\u2019s canonical position. Many classical \nliberals accuse him of apostasy for his separation of social and political \nliberalism from economic liberalism.1   The distinction that Mill draws in his \nwritings on political economy between issues of production and exchange, \nand questions of distribution with the implication that the latter can be a \n 2 \nmatter of public political deliberation gave rise to a rupture in the tradition \nthat later thinkers such as Hayek and those influenced by him came to regard \nas a step on the road to Socialism. Other later liberals regard Mill\u2019s \nutilitarian philosophical foundations as ultimately corrosive of the liberal \nprinciples of freedom and equality that he claims to aspire to.2 Mill\u2019s \npreoccupation with distinctions between quantity and quality of pleasures \nand attempts to derive a robust defence of liberty from considerations of \nwelfare maximisation seem curiously anachronistic in the face of a \ncontractualist liberalism that Mill would have found deeply puzzling. Yet \nalthough it appears that the subsequent development of liberalism into the \ntwentieth century involves a progressive abandonment of Mill\u2019s ideas and \napproach, we can nevertheless argue that the subsequent development of \nliberalism, passing through Hayek and Dewey to the likes of John Rawls in \nthe late twentieth century reflects concerns that are central to Mill. That in it \nself is not a particularly novel claim. Yet in this paper I will offer a different \nversion of this claim by focusing on a concern of Mill\u2019s that is largely \noverlooked in contemporary discussions. This concern is embodied in Mill\u2019s \nmodest scepticism about the claims of social epistemology and his \nappreciation of the political problem of maintaining epistemic diversity in \nthe face of positional advantage and vested interests. I intend to claim that \n 3 \nwhilst contemporary political liberalism differs markedly from Mill\u2019s \ncomprehensive doctrine, it retains his modest scepticism about social \nepistemology and his awareness of the problem of maintaining epistemic \ndiversity, and this is an important lesson as less sceptical liberal theorists \nsuch as Hayek or Dewey enjoy a resurgence of interest amongst \ncontemporary democratic theorists.  \n \nMill on Epistemic Diversity \nThe problem of social epistemology and the related condition of epistemic \ndiversity plays an important role in Mill\u2019s naturalistic social and political \ntheory and in his philosophy of science and of man. As, what would now be \ncalled a \u2018comprehensive\u2019 liberal, Mill\u2019s defence of liberal political principles \nforms part of a wider philosophical vision, which includes claims about how \neach knowing subject comes to have the beliefs they have, and what are the \nnecessary and sufficient conditions for those beliefs being true. Mill\u2019s \nfundamental epistemological position falls squarely into the empiricist \ntradition and rejects the rationalism and intuitionism of contemporaries such \nas Sir William Hamilton.3 His philosophy of science is fundamentally \ninductivist although Mill gives a significant role to deduction from empirical \ngeneralisations in his conception of the nature and practice natural and social \n 4 \nscience. Yet there is also recognition in Mill\u2019s work, that institutions might \nalso play a role in pooling diverse information and might thus assist in the \ngrowth of knowledge and the dissemination of true beliefs. Mill\u2019s utilitarian \napproach to philosophy suggests that the growth of knowledge is itself a \ncondition of human happiness and flourishing. In so far as institutions might \nhave a role in bringing together diverse sources of information they must \nplay an important role in his philosophy. The social or institutional \ndimension of epistemology is fundamental to Mill\u2019s pursuit of truth, \nhappiness and progress. Yet it is clear that Mill is far less sanguine about the \nprospects and benefits of social epistemology than many later thinkers.  \n \nBy way of examining Mill\u2019s complex attitude to social epistemology and its \nimplications for the subsequent development of liberalism we can identify \nthree important mechanisms by which these diverse sources of information \ncan be transmitted and which feature importantly in Mill\u2019s writings; these \nare through speech and discussion, through the price mechanism of free \nmarkets and through votes in elections and legislatures.  Anyone with a \npassing familiarity with Mill\u2019s writings will appreciate the importance of \neach epistemic transmission mechanism in aspects of his major writings. In \nthe rest of this section I will outline Mill\u2019s attitude to each transition \n 5 \nmechanism and argue that the epistemological and political importance of \neach differs in crucial respects. \na. Speech and discussion \nMill\u2019s most forthright and unequivocal defence of epistemic diversity is to \nbe found in Chapter 2 of the essay On Liberty.4 In this chapter Mill offers a \ndefence of the maximum degree of free speech and publication, qualified \nonly by a stringent interpretation of the demands of public order. Inciting \nangry mobs or shouting \u2018fire\u2019 in a crowded theatre are both ruled as \nlegitimate exceptions to the general liberty of speech and discussion, but \npretty much anything else goes. Although Chapter 2 on On Liberty is \ndevoted to speech and opinion, Mill\u2019s argument extends beyond this in the \nsubsequent chapter where his ideal of individuality provides a defence of \nfree expression of ideals beliefs and values, in ways that may not be covered \nby the more intellectualist defence of free speech and discussion. Although \nthe argument for an ideal of individuality in Chapter 3 of On Liberty draws \non ideas of personal autonomy translated into the language of utilitarianism, \nit is clear that Mill remains committed to individuality as a condition of \nsocial experimentation designed to progress towards moral truth.5 Mill is not \nconcerned with expression for its own sake. Expression in terms of \nexperiments in living is concerned with the sincere pursuit of the best form \n 6 \nof life and its appreciation as the best form of life for each person. Mill is \nconcerned to defend the idea that this question can be given a right answer \nand that there is knowledge to be had in respect of how best one ought to \nlive. Mill believed in the idea of moral expertise. Indeed his whole defence \nof the qualitative distinction amongst pleasures in the essay Utilitarianism \nChapter 2 turns on the idea of moral experts who are able to judge \nqualitatively between pleasures, or more precisely activities that give rise to \nthe sensation of pleasure.6 Moral expertise is something that each person can \nin principle acquire through the cultivation of experience and critical \nreflection, however, at any one time not everyone will count as an expert so \nMill\u2019s doctrine of ethics does leave open the possibility of moral elites based \non expertise. We shall return to the significance of these elites later on.  \n \nIt is in this context of seeking the best form of life that Mill\u2019s defence of free \nspeech and opinion is developed. Mill is concerned with the acquisition of \nscientific and moral knowledge as the condition of a good or valuable life. \nTo this end it is imperative that the pursuit of truth in all areas of enquiry is \nunrestricted as the denial of truth diminishes the stock of value in the world. \nIn the justly famous second chapter of On Liberty Mill sums up the case for \nfree expression on the following grounds: \n 7 \n \n First, if any opinion is compelled to silence, that opinion may, \nfor aught we can certainly know, be true. To deny this is to assume \nour own infallibility. \n Secondly, though the silencing opinion be an error, it may, and \nvery commonly does, contain a portion of truth; and since the general \nor prevailing opinion on any subject is rarely or never the whole truth, \nit is only by the collision of adverse opinions that the remainder of the \ntruth has any chance of being supplied. \n Thirdly, even if the received opinion be not only true, but the \nwhole truth; unless it is suffered to be, and actually is, vigorously and \nearnestly contested, it will by most of those who receive it, be held in \nthe manner of a prejudice, with little comprehension or feeling of its \nrational grounds. And not only this, but, fourthly, the meaning of the \ndoctrine itself will be in danger of being lost, or enfeebled, and \ndeprived of its vital effect on the character and conduct: the dogma \nbecoming a mere formal profession, inefficacious for good, but \ncumbering the ground, and preventing the growth of any real and \nheartfelt conviction, from reason or personal experience.7 \n \n 8 \nMill\u2019s defence of speech is not merely a defence of the individual to say \nthings that are considered outrageous from the point of view of traditional \nbeliefs and practices. That is certainly the dominant reading of Mill\u2019s \nargument, and it is undoubtedly part of his concern. Since long before Mill\u2019s \ntime the Liberal defence of speech, belief and the press, had been concerned \nwith saying what is unpopular or uncontroversial. Yet more important even \nthan this fundamental Liberal concern is Mill\u2019s assertion of the need to \nengage actively in speech and discussion. It is the active exchange of \nopinions and beliefs and their continual defence against new challenges that \nMill is also concerned about, hence his otherwise curious argument that even \nthose beliefs we hold to be certain and uncontroversial should be challenged \nand defended with new vigour to each person or generation. People should \nnot merely have the right to hold and profess beliefs or engage in private \nenquiry in the security of their studies. Unless people actively profess, \ndefend and argue for their beliefs the pursuit of knowledge and the task of \ntruth testing cannot take place. The liberty principle once applied to free \nspeech and discussion should not, therefore, be seen as a purely negative \nrestriction on censorship whether this be private or societal. The ideal of \nliberty of speech and discussion is a much more positive or active ideal that \ncan only arise once the dead hand of censorship and tradition is removed.  \n 9 \n \nGiven the importance of diversity of opinion and widespread public \ndiscussion of all issues and ideas, it is perhaps misleading as many do, to \nclaim that Mill believed in a market-place of ideas.8 For although Mill does \nseem to use the market analogy to describe the way in which settled \nconvictions about the truth emerges through competition with other beliefs \nand opinions, the market metaphor does not adequately capture the way in \nwhich Mill wants to actively encourage participation, debate and discussion. \nEven the staunchest defender of the free market is unlikely to see \nparticipation in market exchange in quite this way. We can therefore, draw a \nfairly clear distinction of priority that Mill affords to speech and discussion \nas a mechanism for the institutional channelling of knowledge and that \nwhich he attaches to the price mechanism in a free market.  \n \nThe contrast between the price-mechanism of the free market and Mill\u2019s \naccount of the critical importance of widespread debate and exchange of \nbeliefs turns on his view of the epistemic value of diversity of beliefs as \nsuch. The price mechanism attaches differing values to different kinds of \ngoods and services. When it works efficiently it directs resources to the most \nprofitable areas of activity and away from the least profitable, the price itself \n 10 \nserves as a signal of where to invest or spend and where not to. However, \nalthough high and low prices signal different information, some goods and \nservices, as signalled by price will be shown to have little or no value and \ntherefore the market mechanism should discourage their production. For \nexample there is almost no market currently for Penny Farthing Bicycles so \nalmost none are produced. Yet in Mill\u2019s defence of speech and discussion all \nbeliefs and opinions have some utility as such, even if they are clearly false. \nEven false beliefs have a contribution to make to the pursuit and \nappreciation of truth. It is not that Mill wants to denigrate the idea of \ngenuine knowledge or truth especially in science and ethics, nor does he \nhave a consensus or pragmatist theory of truth. Mill simply wanted to argue \nfor the epistemic value of diversity of beliefs and opinions even false ones \nand this valuing of diversity is not simply connected to the idea of discourse \nand argument as leading to a deliberative account of the public good or \ninterest. Mill\u2019s defence of epistemic diversity is indeed instrumental, but it is \nnot instrumental in terms solely of revealing the public interest as many \ncontemporary deliberative theorists suggests. We shall return to the \nsignificance of this shortly. \nb. Prices. \n 11 \nMill\u2019s Principles of Political Economy became the standard textbook on \neconomics until the marginalist revolution in the later nineteenth century, \nand it conforms to the main outlines of classical theory. Although Mill goes \nto considerable lengths to add nuance and complexity to the Classical theory \nhe inherited from his father and Ricardo on most fundamental issues he \nagrees with his forbears.  This is most clearly illustrated by his endorsement \nof the political economy of laissez-faire. Whilst Mill does not develop an \nideology of economic liberalism that privileges the role of the market in \nquite the way that later economic liberals such as Hayek does, he does \nendorse a respect for the price mechanism as a way of signalling the \ndispersed information that is necessary for making efficient decisions about \nresource allocation amongst conflicting ends and demands. Willingness to \npay as reflected in the price mechanism is a clear indicator of individual \npreferences or wants and this in turn is at least one clear indicator of the \ngeneral interest. As a utilitarian, Mill\u2019s defence of market freedom is given \nin terms of the maximisation of utility rather than in Hayekian \nepistemological terms, but in essence the arguments are the same, at least up \nto a point.  \n \n 12 \nThat point has become one of the main sites of dispute within liberalism \nabout Mill\u2019s canonical status. Whilst Mill follows a broadly laissez-faire \nattitude to the economy and government policy, and whilst this can also be \nseen in his political and social philosophy especially when he discusses \ncontroversial questions such us how far the state should be involved in \nproviding education, when he came to discuss questions of distribution in his \nPrinciples of Political Economy he does suggest that laissez-faire can be \nabandoned. He claims that the economic laws that apply to production \n\u2018\u2026partake of the character of physical truths\u2026\u2019 but that \u2018It is not so with the \nDistribution of Wealth. That is a matter of human institution merely\u2019.10  By \ndescribing the \u2018laws\u2019 of distribution as a human institution he means that \nthey are a function of the system of property that obtains in a particular \nsociety, consequently as those property relations are malleable so the \nstructure and principles of distribution can change. This departure is most \nexplicit in later editions of the Principles\u2019 where Mill appears to concede \nground to socialist arguments, at least as these applied to the distribution of \nthe product of a Capitalist economy. It should however, be noted that the \nconcessions that Mill makes to socialist arguments under the influence of his \nwife Harriet, are hardly significant from the perspective of committed \nsocialists, however dangerous Hayekian liberals may have regarded them. \n 13 \nThere is little or nothing that would have appeared as a significant \nconcession to the kinds of \u2018scientific\u2019 socialist arguments being developed \nby Marx or Engels. \n \nThe implications of Mill\u2019s position in his writings on political economy are \nambiguous from the point of view of social epistemology and the problem of \nepistemic diversity. Whereas Mill adopts a fully laissez-faire attitude to \nspeech and opinion, even to the point of securing the existence of epistemic \nspace for false beliefs, when it comes to the sphere in which laissez-faire is \nmost commonly advocated by classical liberals, he clearly equivocates. His \narguments in relation to the Laws of Distribution is that the price mechanism \nmight well serve as a signalling device, but it does not fully indicate the \npublic good or the greatest happiness of the greatest number, and more \nimportantly, this can be derived in other ways that perhaps contradict the \ndictates of the market. Yet if we probe the question of what alternative \nmechanisms Mill proposed instead of the market we can see that Mill\u2019s \nsocial and political commitment to laissez-faire remains pretty strong. And \nwhat this suggests is that Mill\u2019s primary understanding of the market is not \nas a signalling mechanism for the greatest happiness of the greatest number \nor for constituting the public good but as a regime of liberty. When Mill \n 14 \napplies a market or laissez-faire policy to the political realm it is clear that \nhis concern is primarily with a fear of Government as a sectional interest \nrather than with any epistemological thesis about computation or the \ntechnical ability of government to construct policies in the public interest. \nThe concern is far less with the technical inability of Government to \ncoordinate the myriad sources of knowledge necessary for policy making. \nAs an heir to Benthamite utilitarianism and government reform Mill is \nperfectly open to the idea of more efficient and knowledge based policy- \nmaking. His concern instead is the more fundamental problem political \nmotivation rather than the technical question of epistemic ability, this is \nfurther illustrated in his approach to political institutions and the third \nmechanism used for transmitting social dispersed information, votes. \nc. Votes \nMill\u2019s Considerations on Representative Government,11 is regarded by both \nliberals and democrats as a deeply unsatisfactory compromise between the \nconflicting demands of legislative expertise and of representative \naccountability. Yet it perfectly illustrates Mill\u2019s preoccupation with social \nepistemology and his concern with securing epistemic diversity against the \nthreat of political conformity. Mill\u2019s defence of the vote is interesting in this \nwork because it down plays the idea of voting as signalling information or as \n 15 \na way of revealing a preference or judgement in a process of public \ndeliberation on the public interest. Instead the vote is used to make a more \nbasic judgement of legitimacy rather than a constitutive judgement about the \ncommon good. To explain why Mill sees the vote in participatory rather than \ndeliberative terms we need to go back to an aspect of his moral and political \ntheory discussed earlier. \n \nMill\u2019s distinction between higher and lower pleasures in the essay on \nUtilitarianism introduces the idea of moral expertise.12 The idea is simply \nthat some people with more knowledge and experience will be able to \ndistinguish between more and less valuable ends. As the more valuable ends \nwill bring about greater happiness in the long run and as Mill continues to \nendorse the idea of the greatest happiness as the ultimate criterion of value \nand right action,13 he faces the question of why these moral experts should \nnot rule and benignly impose the general interest on the less experienced and \nless knowledgeable. Mill\u2019s second classic essay On Liberty provides part of \nthe answer to why there should not be rule by such moral experts and this \nsets the agenda for his democratic theory in Considerations on \nRepresentative Government. If we return to our brief discussion of On \nLiberty above, it is clear that Mill is sceptical about elite rule for two \n 16 \nreasons. The first is the problem of elite selection. Much of Mill\u2019s concern \nabout majority tyranny in On Liberty is not merely confined to the familiar \nnineteenth-century worry about democratic levelling and mass man, it is also \nconcerned with the argument of his father James Mill that the rule of a \n\u2018representative class\u2019 the commercial middle class would best secure the \npublic interest. Mill\u2019s concern here, is that the self identification of a social \nclass or group as embodying the public interest or the greatest happiness is \ndangerous. Mill was sceptical about the virtues of the commercial middle \nclass and far from convinced that they were the moral experts that his father \nseemed to suggest. The commercial middle class represent all the dangers of \nself-appointed elites confirming their interest as the public interest, with \ntheir conservative and narrow view of social convention.  But the most \nimportant problem is who identifies the elites or experts and how they are \nchosen. Mill was a sufficiently sensitive reader of Plato\u2019s Republic to \nappreciate the problem of how one can secure rule of experts of the \ndistribution of expert knowledge is not widely shared. This problem was \nobviously appreciated by those claiming the extension of the franchise \nthroughout Mill\u2019s political life, who were far from convinced that the social \nclasses that ruled them were actually the social and political elite in anything \nbut a positional sense. Secondly, Mill was also concerned about the \n 17 \nsubstance of moral expertise. It is one thing to be open to the idea of moral \nand political experts, but it is quite another thing to identify the content of \nthat expertise, and say precisely what moral and political knowledge consists \nin: again Mill\u2019s concern echoes themes from Plato\u2019s Republic, with which \nhe would have been familiar through his friendship with George Grote as \nwell as his early education.14 Both of these issues come together in the \narguments of Considerations on Representative Government.  \n \nOn the franchise, Mill adopts an approach more similar to Bentham\u2019s \nconception of representative democracy than to deliberative or constitutive \ntheories of democracy such as found in Rousseau or more recent democratic \ntheorists. For Bentham the task of the franchise was not to coordinate \ninterests or signal preferences for some social choice function, rather it was \nmerely to hold the legislature to account and remove them when they \nseemed to be acting against the general interest. The votes of the majority \nwere not intended to signal what the general interest was but merely to \nidentify that a particular regime were not acting in accordance with it. \n \nMill\u2019s argument is more subtle than Bentham\u2019s in this respect as in most \nothers, yet he still saw the vote primarily as a judgement of legitimacy rather \n 18 \nthan a signal of judgement about the general interest or greatest happiness. \nMill, like Bentham did not equate the opinion of the majority revealed in a \nvote with the greatest happiness of the greatest number in all but exceptional \ncases. Voting remains a checking mechanism for holding the legislature to \naccount and the exercise of the franchise serves an important role in the \nmoral and political education of those who exercise it. But even though Mill \nthinks that exercising the franchise publicly (as he was against secret ballots) \nwould raise the character and judgement of the electorate, he remained \nsuspicious of the effect of social and economic interests distorting the \npolitical process. For this reason he is more concerned with fragmenting \ndominant social and political interests through devices such as proportional \nrepresentation and plural voting, than he was issues of deliberation and \npreference or judgement aggregation. Mill\u2019s institutional concern is \ntherefore with undermining stable social majorities and the tendency of \ndemocracy towards what he saw as populism. It is in relation to the threat of \npopulism that Mill made is apparently anti-egalitarian concession to plural-\nvoting. The point here is that numbers of votes are distributed according to \neducational qualifications on the grounds that the more informed and \neducated electors would be less inclined to support populism and demagogy. \nProportional representation, of which Mill was an early advocate, has a \n 19 \nsimilar political value. Far from employing mechanisms to pool information \nand knowledge, Mill\u2019s concern is with mechanisms that ensure political \npluralism and diversity. In this respect it is diversity and pluralism as a \nsocial phenomena that matters to Mill just as it did in his account of free-\nspeech and discussion. Again this is not merely because epistemic diversity \nis a good that contributes to the criticism and growth of knowledge, rather it \nis offered as part of the defence against tendencies to social and political \nconformity.15 Epistemic diversity provides part of the check on social \ninterests and groups asserting their status as a representative class or as the \npolitical elite. So once again when Mill appeals to epistemic diversity it is to \nsupport political and social diversity and hence freedom. The defence is cast \nin political rather than epistemological terms. \n \nHowever, voting does not only take place in the exercise of the franchise but \nalso within legislatures. It might be argued that in this context Mill\u2019s concern \nis less with the protective role of representative democracy and more with \nthe deliberative role, where voting might well serve as a signalling device or \nmechanism for transferring dispersed knowledge and expertise. \n \n 20 \nBut even in the context of legislation, Mill seems to avoid appealing to \ninstitutional mechanisms as a way of pooling information and knowledge in \norder to secure the public interest. In Considerations\u2019 Mill distinguishes the \nrole of elected legislators and the civil service or bureaucracy who initiate \nand develop policy of the legislative to judge and approve. Clearly Mill \nthought that legislators should be intelligent and wiser than their electorate \nas this is what ultimately qualifies them to judge on behalf of their electors. \nThat said, he attaches most importance to the civil service or bureaucrats \nwho initiate policy and who will be the genuine political elite. It is the small \ngroup or cadre of bureaucrats who serve as the philosopher kings and \ndevelop policy based on that expertise, once again illustrating Mill\u2019s view \nthat their can be such experts and that there is something for them to be \nexperts in. Deliberation will obviously take place amongst this group as they \ndevelop and initiate policy or proposed legislation, but Mill does not provide \nmuch discussion of the institutional structures in which this takes place and \nprovides no discussion of mechanisms and structures which might make this \nmore effective. In so far as Mill seems to have a model it is that of open \ndiscussion freed from the burdens of having to \u2018sell\u2019 policy to an electorate \nor having to initiate policy at the behest of a party manifesto. Again the \n 21 \nmodel seems to be the pluralistic and structure-less one that we can find in \nhis defence of free speech and discussion. \n \nOnce policy is presented to the legislature for voting and endorsement we \nmight seem to be back with epistemological questions about judgement \naggregation and deliberative democracy. Yet even in this case Mill\u2019s \nconcern remains largely protective as the role of the legislature is to set \nchecks on the bureaucratic elite acting in its own interest. Mill retains a \nBenthamite suspicion of government, in any of its dimensions, acting as a \nsinister interest apart from the general interest, or imposing its interest as the \ngeneral interest.16 This does involve the legislature making judgements \nabout the greatest happiness or public interest, but crucially Mill emphasises \nthe checking or legitimating dimension of the judgement, rather than any \nclaim that such judgements when aggregated constitute the greatest \nhappiness. Mill retains a strong liberal scepticism about the institutions of \ngovernment and their ability to track or constitute the greatest happiness of \nthe greatest number. Obviously, as a utilitarian and not a libertarian, Mill\u2019s \nscepticism is qualified. He like Bentham does not want to regard \nGovernment as always the enemy and always acting against the general \ninterest. But equally he wants to avoid the idea that a set of institutions can \n 22 \nbe constructed that would perfectly track the public interest or the greatest \nhappiness. All such institutions will be fallible and therefore they need to be \nregarded with a healthy scepticism. Whilst they may deliver the greatest \nhappiness of the greatest number, there will always be cases in which they \nfail to do so. But more important even than this scepticism about social \nepistemology is Mill\u2019s more profound political scepticism. The constant \ndanger that the liberal state must protect against is that a particular social \ngroup could colonise and pervert the functioning of such institutions. This is \nwhat Bentham feared in characterising government as a sinister interest. The \ngovernment, including both elected representatives, members of the \nexecutive, but also functionaries such as Judges and civil servants are \nunavoidably an interest apart from those they represent or serve and this is \nbecause of the way the positions they occupy within the structures of the \nmodern state shape and transform their personal or selfish interests. Bentham \narguably failed to provide a full theory of interest and therefore failed to \nappreciate the social forces that manifest themselves through social and \npolitical interests. Mill, however seems to have had a much more acute \nappreciation of the problems of social interests and the threat they posed to \nthe possibility of a genuinely public interest. This is clearly illustrated at the \nbeginning of the essay On Liberty where Mill draws attention to new threats \n 23 \nto freedom that cannot be dealt with, as Bentham and all liberals preceding \nhim had hoped, merely by the distribution of civil and political rights. \nHowever, much we might wish to construct institutions that channel and \nsignal dispersed knowledge the primary concern of liberals must remain a \ncaution about the way in which these institutions can be distorted by \nfactional interests.  \n \nOne should not over-emphasise Mill\u2019s scepticism about the impact of \npolitical interests acting against the public interest or the greatest happiness, \nas he was undoubtedly optimistic about the growth of knowledge.17 But even \nthis progressive optimism depended upon the growth of the right kind of \ncharacter amongst the whole population. Politics could play a part in the \ncultivation of this liberal character and that is certainly one of the concerns \nunderlying the institutional design within Considerations on Representative \nGovernment, but it is interesting that Mill is concerned primarily with the \ncultivation of character and dispositions. He remained profoundly wary of \nthe state\u2019s involvement in the cultivation of the intellect or in its imparting \nbeliefs and knowledge. For Mill, knowledge was widely dispersed \nthroughout society, but it is important for him that it remained widely \ndispersed and that it remained difficult for it to be pooled into any one \n 24 \ninstitutional site or structure. Epistemic diversity remained an end to be \npreserved not overcome. \n \nEpistemic diversity, Millian scepticism and later liberal theory. \n \nThe subsequent development of liberal theory in the later nineteenth and \nearly twentieth century can be seen to abandon much that preoccupied Mill. \nIdealist liberals such as T.H. Green and \u2018new liberals\u2019 such as L.T. \nHobhouse took up themes in Mill later writings and emphasised the social \nand material conditions of the exercise of freedom as autonomy. Although \nsome of these themes are undoubtedly in Mill, they also drew on continental \nsources such as Kant in developing a non-naturalistic and perfectionist \naccount of autonomy and freedom. This new tradition came to adopt a much \nmore sympathetic attitude to the state as a condition of freedom and human \nflourishing.18 This rapprochement with the state as an active condition of \nfreedom and autonomy marked a considerable departure from the sceptical \nclassical tradition that we find in Mill, and provided the opportunity for a \nrestatement of the classical position by mid-twentieth century liberals such \nas F.A. Hayek. Yet Hayek\u2019s classical turn was not the only response to the \n\u2018statism\u2019 of new liberalism. John Dewey\u2019s pragmatist liberal theory shared \n 25 \nmuch with the aspirations of new liberalism yet he retained a Millian \nscepticism about the reliance on the state and placed more trust in the \nextension of democracy throughout all aspects of society. \nHayek and Dewey \nHayek and Dewey are both important liberal philosophers, but apart from \nsharing that deeply contested title they appear to share very little else in \ncommon. Hayek is concerned with providing a modern restatement and \ndefence of the classical liberal laissez-faire policy of small non-\ninterventionist government and a strong free market. Dewey\u2019s liberalism is \nbased on a commitment to democracy and experimentation in all social \ninstitutions.19 In many respects Dewey\u2019s liberalism is closer to the liberalism \nof \u2018new liberal\u2019 sociologists such as L.T. Hobhouse in Britain, but he differs \nin that his pragmatist philosophy places far greater emphasis on social \nepistemology as the justification for the democratisation of social and \npolitical institutions. It is this commitment to social epistemology that \nultimately connects Dewey and Hayek, both of whom, unlike Mill, place \nconsiderable faith in social epistemology and the institutional dimensions of \nknowledge production. But as we shall see even that enthusiasm is qualified \nby the partial acknowledgement of problems raised by Mill. \n \n 26 \nThroughout his work, F.A. Hayek develops an argument for the free market \nin terms of institutional or social epistemology. As a young man he \nabandoned his early sympathy for social democracy under the influence of \nLudwig von Mises\u2019s critique if socialism for its inability to mirror the \ncomplex information processing structure of the free market.20 The effect of \nthe calculation debate remained central to Hayek\u2019s later defence of the free \nmarket and his critique of the welfare state as a stage on the \u2018Road to \nSerfdom\u2019. In many of his works this criticism takes on a polemical tone, but \nunderlying that was a serious analysis of the way in which institutions could \nserve an epistemological goal.21 For Hayek the problem that socialist \nplanners failed to adequately address was the problem of efficiently \nallocating resources in a centrally planned economy. No central state body \nwas able to gather the widely dispersed knowledge and information \nnecessary to solve the problem of efficient resource allocation, however the \nfree market provided such a mechanism through the price mechanism. Prices \nsignalled dispersed information to the myriad producers and consumers \nthroughout the market. As long as allocative decisions were left to an \nunrestricted market the consequences of its function were by definition the \nmost efficient outcomes. More importantly for Hayek there was no further \nindependent criterion such as the general happiness or the public interest \n 27 \nagainst which market allocations could be assessed, as the formation of these \ncriteria would either need to be self evident or themselves the product of \nsome decision making process that pooled the dispersed information of all \nthose concerned. And given that a government could not provide such an \nefficient allocation it would have to impose an arbitrary one. That is why \neven the well-meaning desires of western social democrats left us on the \nroad to totalitarian serfdom. In this way Hayek\u2019s critique of non market \nbased distributive principles mirrors Michael Oakeshott\u2019s criticism of the \nconsequences of rationalism in politics, namely it imposes an arbitrary and \npartial political settlement on the complex of individual social and political \ndecisions. Governing parties, however, well-meaning could not by definition \nknow the best way to structure outcomes that could only be revealed through \nthe price mechanism and would therefore have to rely on their own arbitrary \nprescriptions. These prescriptions would have no obvious normative \nauthority other than that they reflected the interests of the groups holding \npolitical power. And it is for this reason that Hayek adopts a classical liberal \nscepticism about the state as a source of social justice or a guide to the good \nlife. His argument appears to reflect Mill\u2019s concern about the way the state \ncan be colonised by social and political interests masquerading as moral and \npolitical experts. However, Hayek\u2019s argument is stronger than Mill\u2019s in that \n 28 \nMill does at least allow that there can be such moral and political experts \neven if we have difficulty selecting them from groups who make bogus \nclaims to be experts, such as religious authorities. For Hayek\u2019s stronger \nclaim is that there could not be such experts as they would have to have \nsome way of collating and processing dispersed knowledge and information \nin the same way that markets do and the epistemological analysis of the \nmarket renders that prospect impossible.  \n \nIt is precisely because Mill seems to allow for the prospect of moral \nexpertise that those influenced by Hayek\u2019s arguments are suspicious of his \narguments. Mill acknowledged that the state could be colonised by sectional \nor sinister interests, but he always held out the prospect that some group \ncould emerge that would indeed be able to offer its expertise to rule wisely \nand efficiently. This suspicion was compounded by Mill\u2019s abandonment of \nclassical liberal orthodoxy over the matter of economic distribution. For \nHayekians, Mill\u2019s distinction between questions of production and \ndistribution is simply a mistake and failed to acknowledge the ways in which \ndistributive decisions of markets were themselves important indicators of \ndispersed knowledge. To remove distributive decisions for the nexus of \nmarket decision-making would both distort the epistemological function of \n 29 \nmarkets and interpose an arbitrary and normatively groundless political \ndecision in their stead.  \n \nThis Hayekian brand of epistemological liberalism persists in contemporary \npolitical philosophy, most recently in Chandran Kukathas\u2019 contribution to \nthe debate about multiculturalism. For Kukathas, the attempt to impose a \nconception of group solidarity on the diverse cultural groups in modern \nliberal societies is to assume that one model of cultural integration can be \ndistinguished from the myriad values and beliefs of such groups. Even \nliberal norms of equality would themselves form partial impositions on the \ndiversity of society that emerges from the market in beliefs practices and \nvalues. For Kukathas an appropriate response to societal diversity in a robust \nform of benign neglect, whereby groups are able to get on with what they do \nin their own terms, with the only condition being that they do not prevent the \nphysical exit of members who no longer wish to accept the associative \nobligations of group membership. Groups are not required to make exit easy, \nbut as long as they do not prevent it by imprisoning members or putting \nphysical obstacles in the way of members they should be left to do as they \nwish.  \n \n 30 \nKukathas\u2019s classical liberal vision of multiculturalism owes much to \nHayek\u2019s argument and differs considerably from the kind of liberalism \nadvocated by Mill. Yet in important respects it also illustrates how, Hayek\u2019s \nmore sceptical classical liberalism and his commitment to social \nepistemology runs into conflict with the Millian requirement to maintain \nepistemic diversity. \n \nFor Mill, the maintenance epistemic diversity became a more pressing \nconcern than the construction of a social or institutional epistemology. \nEpistemic diversity remained a good in itself as part of the conditions of \nsocial and political progress and was not primarily seen as a problem to be \novercome in constructing a conception of the general interest. For Hayek, \nand for Kukathas, the epistemological argument remained the basis for \nliberalism. However the consequences of their epistemological approach is a \nmore thorough going scepticism that in the end becomes self-undermining.  \n \nIn the case of Hayek\u2019s argument there is no acknowledgement that markets \ncan fail in their information-signalling role. He famously has a problem with \nthe issue of the growth of monopolies and monopoly distortion of free \nmarkets and consequently the way in which markets can be sites of power \n 31 \nand influence as much as information signalling devices. This can be \nillustrated in the case of Kukathas\u2019s Hayekian multiculturalism. Many \nminority cultural groups have sought group recognition and group specific \nrights and entitlements to defend themselves from the dominance of majority \ncultural practices. These provisions can be claimed as a matter of right when \nthey are seen as a response to the coercive imposition of majority practices \nby former colonial states.23 The same argument might also be extended to \ndecisions by minority linguistic communities to defend themselves against \nthe consequences of economic and cultural globalisation. In the face of the \ndominant power of some cultures others become swamped and disappear. \nFor Kukathas and presumably Hayek, this is a neutral process that follows \nthe choices of individuals to choose the lives they prefer when confronted \nwith alternatives. If everyone chooses Cocoa-coal, Macdonalds and MTV \nthat will merely prove that they are genuinely more attractive than whatever \nis offered by minority communities. Cultural diversity is not a good in itself \nthat should be coercively maintained, and to try and do so would be \nimposing one person or group\u2019s controversial conception of what is valuable \non everyone else. But one consequence of this laissez-faire approach is that \nHayek and Kukathas\u2019s strong epistemological scepticism potentially \nconflicts with epistemic diversity of the sort that Mill valued so highly, with \n 32 \nthe consequence that a market of ideas and values of this sort might end up \nwith only a very few perspectives surviving. Hayek\u2019s market driven social \nand institutional epistemology potentially undercuts epistemic diversity \nbecause unlike Mill it only acknowledges government or the state as a \ndistorting institution. As long as the state is not interfering intervening in \nmarket decisions then these will serve their appropriate epistemological \npurpose. Yet Mill, acknowledged at the very beginning of On Liberty that \ngovernment was not the only threat to liberty in all its guises but that social \nforces could also threaten social and political as well as epistemic diversity. \nUnlike Hayek\u2019s epistemological argument for the market, Mill attaches no \nspecial epistemological authority to any institution, therefore his theory has \nno problem with the idea that dominant power can be exercised by economic \ninterests just as much as social and political interests, and that these can \nundermine the epistemological function of the market. Mill would therefore \nbe far from sanguine about Kukathas\u2019s Hayekian disregard for cultural \ndiversity in the face of economic globalisation. \n \nHayek\u2019s failure to acknowledge that a laissez-faire approach to markets \nmight undermine the very epistemological defence of market institutions can \n 33 \nbe contrasted with John Dewey\u2019s more thoroughgoing approach to social \nepistemology. \n \nWhere Hayek placed all his emphasis on the price mechanism as an \ninformation pooling and signalling device, Dewey directed his attention to \ndemocracy and its commitment to voting and speech and deliberation. In the \nprocess of democratic deliberation citizens were engaged in a large scale \nprocess of experimentation in which various proposed solutions to social and \npolitical problems are rehearsed and their potential consequences assessed.24  \nIn favouring deliberation Dewey draws on the idea of dispersed practical \nintelligence that is brought to bear through the cooperative engagement \nbetween citizens, representatives and state and bureaucratic functionaries. \nDemocratic deliberation of this kind is also revisable in the light of \ndisconfirmation and new evidence, so that policies that fail or do not work as \nexpected can be changed. Deliberation is a discovery method and as with \nexperimentalism in natural science, it is the method as much as the \nsubstantive beliefs generated by it that matters.  \n \nLike Hayek and Mill, Dewey\u2019s conception of practical intelligence involves \nthe belief that knowledge and information is often unarticulated and widely \n 34 \ndispersed in society, it is not merely held by an educated intellectual and \ncultural elite. It is therefore important that all voices are heard and that no \nparticular set of voices dominates discussion. For this reason Dewey\u2019s \nexperimentalist approach to deliberation is strongly connected with his idea \nof democratic equality. All voices should be included in the deliberative \nprocess in order for collective decision making to serve the knowledge \ngathering process of public deliberation. Every individual and social group \nhas a distinct perspective that is important for genuine public deliberation. \nThe exclusion of distortion of such views of voices is no different from the \nfalsification of evidence in natural science, and it casts doubt on the view \nthat the outcomes of democratic deliberation genuinely constitute the public \ninterest.  \nDewey acknowledges the importance of democratising the state and \ndeveloping further opportunities for voting and deliberation within state \nstructures, but for he also acknowledged that for his ideal of democracy as \nsocial experiment to work it could not simply focus on such state structures. \nInstead Democracy requires that all individuals adopt the ethos of \ndeliberation, experiment and recognition of diversity in all aspects of their \ncivil lives. Democracy requires a democratic civil society as well as a legal \nand constitutional structure. And this involves the development and \n 35 \nnurturing of parties and associations that embody the claims of individuals \nand group members dispersed throughout society. It also involves a genuine \nethos of toleration of diversity and openness to different opinions. This will \nrequire political control over groups and factions that try and distort free \ncommunication or who silence debate and deliberation because of their \ncontrol of organs of the state or through the monopoly ownership in the \npress and media. Unlike Hayek, Dewey is prepared to see the outcomes of a \nfree market in the press and media as great a potential threat to deliberation \nand social experimentation as state control. For Dewey, Randolph Hearst (or \nin our own day Rupert Murdoch) could be just a great a threat to Democracy \nthrough his monopoly control of opinion, as he could be an assistance to \nDemocracy through holding the state to account. It is partly this aspect of \nDewey\u2019s thought that has made him attractive to contemporary thinkers.25 \nYet Dewey was also aware that Democratic deliberation could increase \nopportunities for conflict as well as knowledge gathering and information \npooling. The Liberal character of his conception of democracy is often \nforcefully asserted in his writings: \n \nIntolerance, abuse, calling of names because of differences of opinion \nabout religion or politics or business, as well as because of differences \n 36 \nof race, color, wealth or degree of culture are treason to the \ndemocratic way of life. For everything which bars freedom and \nfullness of communication sets up barriers that divide human being \ninto sets and cliques, into antagonistic sects and factions, and thereby \nundermines the democratic way of life. Merely legal guarantees of the \ncivil liberties of free belief, free expression, and free assembly are of \nlittle avail if in daily life freedom of communication, the give and take \nof ideas, facts, experiences, is choked by mutual suspicion, b y abuse, \nby fear and hatred.26 \n \nIn many ways, Dewey\u2019s democratic philosophy mirrors aspects of Mill\u2019s \ndefence of epistemic diversity. Dewey is much more optimistic than Mill \nabout democracy as a discovery procedure, but he is similarly concerned, in \na way that Hayek is not, with the requirements of maintaining epistemic \ndiversity. Dewey\u2019s conception of practical intelligence requires both the idea \nof dispersed knowledge of what works and what does not. Failure, error and \nuntruth remain important for Dewey just as they did for Mill, as error plays \nan important role in the progress of knowledge. \n \n 37 \nYet given Dewey\u2019s acknowledgement of social forces and institutions that \ncan frustrate democracy, and his account of those values and beliefs that \nsilence debate or recognition, such as differences over race, culture and \nreligious belief, he has a problem accounting for terms of inclusion and \nprinciples that rule some beliefs and values into debate as part of legitimate \ndiversity and those beliefs that fail to count as legitimate contributions to \ndebate. For Dewey, unlike Mill the solution to these problems is more \ndemocracy, but that seems to beg the question, as the problem faced in \ndefending deliberative conceptions of democracy concerns deliberation \namongst whom?27 \n \nUnlike Dewey, Mill\u2019s response to this problem is to opt for a liberal defence \nof epistemic diversity over a democratic social epistemology, and to rely on \na non-democratic or non-deliberative account of the norms of inclusion that \nprotect this account of epistemic diversity. For Mill, the non-deliberative \naccount of the norm of inclusion is provided by his utilitarian theory and his \nutilitarian commitment to the principle of liberty. In other words Mill asserts \nthe priority of philosophy over democracy. \n \n 38 \nConclusion - Political Liberalism and the abandonment of \nepistemology? \n \nBy way of conclusion we can see that contemporary political liberalism has \nabandoned the epistemological turn chosen by Hayek and Dewey and \nreturned to a Liberal stance more closely associated with Mill\u2019s scepticism \nabout the merits of social epistemology. Liberal theory since the publication \nof Rawls\u2019 A Theory of Justice in 1971, has deliberately avoided the \npreoccupation with social epistemology found in mid-century liberals such \nas Hayek or Dewey. This lack of interest in social epistemology and political \nliberalism\u2019s more general \u2018epistemic abstinence\u201928 might simply reflect an \nacknowledgement of the academic division of labour, whereby political \nphilosophers such as Rawls focus on the justification of normative \nprinciples, whereas social scientists engage in the kinds of questions that \nHayek or Dewey were concerned with. There is something in this idea and \nthe related claims that Hayek became too much of a political philosopher \nand not enough of an economist, or that Dewey\u2019s philosophy drew too \neclectically from a variety of disciplines. Yet there is more to the argument \nthan recognition of the claims of economics, social psychology and \nempirical political science.  \n 39 \n \nThe abandonment of epistemology embodied in the political liberal \naspiration to provide a neutral defence of liberal principles, involves not just \nthe recognition of the difficulty of establishing consensus around a particular \nconception of the good.29 It also involves a recognition of the fact of social \nand epistemic diversity, and the undesirability of eradicating it, even though \nRawls like Mill is not committed to conceding the truth or rightness of any \nor all current conceptions of the good held in a plural liberal society.  \n \nOf course, this does not mean that anything goes. Maintaining diversity \ninvolves the distribution of sets of rights, liberties and bundles of resources \nthat enables individuals to pursue their own conceptions of the good. In this \nrespect Rawlsian political liberalism is consistent with both Mill and Dewey, \nthough not Hayek.  However, where contemporary political liberalism \ndeparts from the epistemological liberalism of Dewey or contemporary \ndeliberative democrats influenced by him, is in the Millian commitment to \nthe primacy of liberal political philosophy over democracy.  In this respect \ncontemporary political liberalism, like Mill\u2019s utilitarian liberalism, remains \nwedded to the priority of normative political philosophy over epistemology. \n 40 \nThis remains one of its greatest strengths and one of its most formidable \nchallenges. \n \nNotes \n1.
