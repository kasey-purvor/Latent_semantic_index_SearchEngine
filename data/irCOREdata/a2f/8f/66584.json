Its rationale, however, is nor solely diachronic: the starr-\ning point is rather a widely accepted ptemise that between what goes before\nand what comes after there is a fault-line in the narure of the availability\nof Homer to English literary consciousness. A critical event can be readily\nidentified, in the publication of F. A. Wolf's Prolegomena to HOllier of 1795.\nThis work itself is the product of a period of change and questioning: the\neighteenth century saw a steady growth in historical, topographical and anti-\nquarian interest in the ancient world. In relation to Homer, Robert Wood had\nprovided one of the most influenriallandmarks in his investigation, based on\ntravels underraken in the early J 750S, of Homer's own time and culture, All\nEssay on the Original Gellills of Homer (1769).' Wolf, however, is definitive:\nThe Homer that we hold in our hands now is nor the one who flourished in the\nmourhs of rhe Greeks of his own day, bur one variously' altered, interpolated,\ncorrected. and emended from the times of Solon down ro those of the Alexan\u00b7\ndrians. Learned and clever men have long felr their way to this conclusion by\nusing various scattered bits of evidence; but now rhe voices of all periods joined\nrogether bear wirness, and history speaks. .l.\nThe interests of classical scholarship and literary criticism rarely, if ever, keep\nprecise step: a primitive and even 'patched together' Homer is a presence in\nEnglish letters long before 1795, and the image of Homer as the supreme\npoetic ancestor prevails, for those who chose or choose to view him thus,\nlong after. Homer - inevitably, as a focal point of ancient-modern controver-\nsies and of a range of aesthetic debates about simplicity, originality and the\nI On the growth of the: historical approach and on Wood, sec Foerster (1\"947) paSSI11I. and\nSimonsuuri (J 979) 133-42.\n, Wolf (1985) 209.\n272\nHomer and English epic\nheroic - is not a simple value in the period here under discussion. By the end\nof it, however, the ground is laid for the separation of a newly historicised\nand pre-literate 'Homer' from his text and its authority, and for a significanr\nchallenge to rhe possibility of a direcr engagement with a single author as\nsource: Homer becomes as emphatically a question as an authority. \\X1ith this\ncontext in mind, the questions asked in this chapter are about the availability\nof Homer before this point for 'epic' creativity in English, and they will be\nexplored in panicular through a consideration of the two unquestionably\ncreative Homeric readings of the period - those of Milton in Paradise Lost\nand Pope in his translation of the Iliad.\nAnother function of this chapter, before the focus is brought to bear on\nthis specific argument, is to offer a bro'lder characterisation of the place of\nHomer in English epic up to the end of the eighteemh century. It might first\nbe poimed out that there is a latent paradox in the subject itself. A primary\nrequiremem of epic since its first theorisations has been that it should have\na serious significance for its own age and nation. The nco-classical version\nof the premise that epic should have a serious moral purpose led Dryden nO!\nonly to conclude that all succeeding poets ought rather to imitate Virgil than\nHomer (whose hero Achille is seen as flawed by extremes of passion and\nrevenge), but further - when contemplating his own epic proicer - to seek\nspecifically an English story, one 'neither too far distam from the present\nage, nor toO near approaching it'.; An English epic may draw strength from\nanalogy with the epics of the past, but it must also typically render them\nanacluonistic. Its relation to earlier examples is energetically revisionary,\nFor E. M. W. Tillyard fifty years ago, 'English epic' is a qualitative rather\nthan formal entity, the canon composed of works with a national or choric\nsignificance (Piers Plowman, The Faerie Qlleene. Paradise Lost, Bunyan's\nHoly War, Pope's Iliad and Gibbon's Decline and Fa\/\/).' What is charac-\nteristic of these greater works is also visible in the lesser, in the mostly for-\ngotten 'epic' himerland with which British poerr)\" of this period abounds.'\nEnglish epic, whether qualitatively or quantitatively defined, ha only lim-\nited Comact with Homer: many epic endeavours have a Latinate rather than\nI Dryden (196;1.) 1.191; ;!..186. 01 Till)':trd (19HI.\nI Wnters of epic poems include Michael Dr:t)'fOll. lInuel Daniel.

The search for an appropriate and sufficient subject\nis a key element of epic endeavour. The several incompatibilities of classical\nepic with a true 'English' epic design seem to make themselves manifest in\nthe eight-line cui de sac of Pope's late fragment 'Brutus', with the poet's plea\nto be 'snatched'\n.... to thy holy hill of spotless Bay,\nMy Counrr)'s Poet, to record her Fame,\nfollowed only by a silence which constitutes an ironic and involuntary coun-\ntetpart to the silence at the end of Book 4 of the Dzmciad.6 Fielding's semi\u00b7\nserious construction of a classical epic genealogy for the English novel \"'\nalma t exactly the same time in the 'Preface' ro Joseph Andrews perhaps\nprimarily serves to point up the discontinuities and departures of the new\nform. 7\nThe more genetal importance of Homer for English readers up to the end oi\nthe eighteenth century has been well explored by scholars in recent decades.\nand new technologies now offer new ways of quantifying his presence in the\nworld of the printed book. 8 Thanks ro the electronic resources of the ESTC.\nwe can say with a new certainty that up to the end of the eighteenth cemurl\"\nHomer comes in, in terms of English 'editions' (including translations), first\nof Greek and fifth of all classical writers (afrer Ovid, Horace, Cicero and Vir-\ngil, and just before Aesop and Xenophon); and that by the same art of mea-\nsure the Iliad is more than twice as popular as the Odyss,')'. A search of rhe\nEnglish poetry database of Literatnre Oldine (http:\/\/lion.chadlll)'ck.co.JlkfI\nsuggests that even excluding Pope there are more references ro Homer before\nT 800 than to any other classical poet except Horace. As with all classical\nauthors, the eighteenth century sees a significant increase in the availabilirl\"\nof the Iliad and the Odyssey to the English readet, and in particular ro English\nreaders previously excl uded by class or gender from access ro the classics.\nThe count of editions of Pope's Homer alone is startling el'idence of th,\ndegree ro which the translations that served Pope himself so well financial\"\n6 Pope, 'Fragmcnr of Brutus rtn ~pic', in Pope (1940-69) 6.404.\n- On the relations of classical epic to the: eightecmh-cC'llfur)' novel sec, e.g. Maresca (19-4 .\nMace (1996l61-76.\nII General studies include Clarke (1981).

Troy was Homer's ter-\nrain, and a magnet for local 'Homeric' emotion both for visitors and in the\nimagination, but Tro)' in European and English literature is not always or\neven primarily Homeric. The Iliad and the Odyssey deal wirh rwo episodes\nfalling before and afrer rhe fall of Troy - rhe wrarh of Achilles, and rhe\nhomecoming of Odysseus. The fuller srory of Tro)', from the marriage of\nPeleus and Theris and rhe judgment of Paris ro the dearh of Achilles, rhe\nTrojan horse and the returns of the various heroes fO their homelands, is\nelsewhere, and the tradition feeding infO the version of Troy known fO writ-\ners and readers in the Renaissance - and beyond - has many later classi-\ncal and posr-c1assical threads. Chaucer's apt vision is of 'gret Orner' wirh\na number of others - Dares, Tytus IDietysj, 'Lollius', Guido and Geoffrey\nof Monmouth - all together 'besy for ro bere up Troye' (The House of\nFame, 1,464-80). Among the most influential rival accounts were the two\nallegedly 'eye-witness' memoirs of rhe war by 'Dicrys rhe Creran' and 'Dares\nlhe Phrygian', offering invitingly novelisric derail and verisimilirude. A new\nlove emphasis is introduced, in Achilles' love for Polyxena, serting rhe scene\nfor the Ovid ian developments of Benoit de Sainte-Maure's rwelfrh-century\nRoman de Troie and the introduction of Troilus' romance with Briseida,\nlarer rhe Cressida of Chaucer and Shakespeare. From irs various medieval\nversions the Troy story moves ro Lydgate's Troy Book and Caxron's Recuyell\nofth\" Histories of Troye (1475) - the first book printed in the English lan-\nguage, and an important source for Shakespeare's Troilus alld Cressida. '0\nChapman's translation of seven books of the Iliad had been published in\n1598, some three or four years before the production of the play.

II\nDirectly through example, or indirectly through allegory, Homer here rep\u00b7\nresents not only the source of epic poetry but also mastery of all useful\nknowledge. What may nOt be immediately apparent to a modern reader is\nthe degree to which - despite his fame and the many ancient testimonies\nto it marshalled by Chapman himself - Homer was, and was to remain, in\nneed of patronage as a worthy epic authority. The stabiliry of the crowded\nHomeric pillar in Chaucet's House of Fame (1,477-9) is threatened by the\nstresses of envy ('Oon seyde that Omer made Iyes, I Feynynge in hys poel-\nries, I And was to Grekes favorable'), and the history of the Homeric war\nof detraction and defence from antiquity to the eighteenth century has been\nwell documented by Howard Clarke and orhers.\" In seventeenth-centur)\nFrance Homer became the ptimary target of the supposedly progressiv<\n'modern' faction anxious to rid themselves of allegiance to rhe classical past\nin general, but the manners of both gods and heroes in the poems were in\nany case unsurprisingly vulnerable on a number of counts to the proprieties\nof seventeenth-century neo-c1assicism and religion.

Milton could read Greek with ease, and as his earliest pub-\nIi hed remarks on his poeric ambirions make clear (in The Reasoll of Church\nGovernment, 1642), he was fully immersed in an older and more eclec-\nric European tradition which fed inro his own rousing btand of lirerary\npatriotism:\nIapply'd my selfe ro . .. fix all the indusrry and an Icould unire [Q rhe adorning\nof my native tongue; nor ro make verbal curiosities rhe end. that were a roylsom\n,\u00b7aniry, bur to ~ an interpreter & relater of r.he besr and sagesr rhings among\nmine own Citizens rhroughout rhis lIand in rhe morher dialect.

I'\nAll Milton's 'indusrry and arr' as revealed rwenry-five years larer in rhe pub-\nlicarion of Paradise Lost is clearly a rail order for any reader or even any\nscholar fO march, then or now. There is however one simpler overarching\nparrern which effecrively conrains almosr any degree of awareness of or sen-\nsiriviry to rhe rexrure of allusion in rhe poem. As Michael' immediarely\nposr-Iapsarian rurorial to Adam makes manifesr, rhe acrion of Paradise Lost\nesrablishes irself as a pre-eondirion of all orher examples of rhe heroic or epic\nwirhin rhe hisrory of mankind. Adam (himself srill, or already, inclined to\nlook forward to a good convenrional fighr berween rhe Son and rhe serpem al\n12.384-5) is looking forward, nor back, to an age in which 'Mighr only shall\nbe admir'd I And Valor and Heroic Virtue call'd' (1I.689-90). Througholll\nrhe poem Milron resolurely refuses rhe condirion of 'following after': rhe wil\nof rhis densely composire work is ro asserr irs own primacy over rhe disiecta\nmembra of which ir is composed. References and allusions - however explic-\nitly invoked or hidden, however easily recognised or far-ferched - are rhereby\nrransformed inro fore-shadowings, ironic rypologies, echo-chambers of rhe\nfuture rarher rhan rhe past. This paradoxical bur powerfully evocarive effen\nborh ironises and in irs inclusiveness sancrions the allusion-hunting indusrry\nwhich has flourished ever since Patrick Hume's Annotalions of 1695 and\nAddison's Spectalor essays of [7J2; and ir inevirably rhrows irs colouring\nover rhe presence of Homer as of rhe orher 'grearesr and choicesr wirs' in rhe\npoem.\nPerhaps rhe mosr srriking Homeric allusion in Paradise Losl is rhe evo-\ncarion as a parallel for Saran's journey rhrough Chaos of the wanderings\nof Odysseus, alrhough the dialogue wirh the Iliad - as a narrative of rhe\nfaral consequences of error culminaring in a version of reconciliarion - is in\nrerms of the poem's srrucrures arguably the more consisrenr. Rhetorically.\nrhe relarion wirh rhe Homeric poems is construcred rhIOugh complex bUI\nconrrolled processes of conlaminalio (rhe mixing of several traditions in\none), relraelalio or revisionary handling, and overt comparison, where Ihl\"\naxis of allusion is always as much thar of di criminarion as of similarity. In\nBook 9 of Paradise LOsl, for example, there are three explicit refCIences 10\nIS 'The reason of church-government urg'd against prelacy', in Milton (1953-8:.) 1.811-1:'.\nFletcher (1956-61) offers a u.sefuland comprehensive account of the educational background.\nalthough his account of Milton's Greek reading relies on the attribution to Milton (no IOllltrf\naccepted) of copious mafginalannotations in a 1620 edition of Pind:1r. See :1150 Parker (199(,1.\nHomer and English epic\nHomer's Odyssey, all suggesting a negative calibration of comparability: in\nthe invocation, whete the just rebuke and judgment of Jehovah is asserted\nto be 'not less bur more heroic' than 'Neptune's ire ... that so long I Per\u00b7\nplex'd the Greek'; in the garden of Eden, 'spot more delicious' than the\ngardens of Alcinous; and in relation to Eve herself, as an in.nocent Circe,\nattended by 'more duteous' beasts. Seen from one side the trope is a rela-\ntively simple one of augmentation, with the primacy of Iv1ilron's subject con-\nstandy asserted, whether as prototype or superior replacement: as seen from\nrhe othet it becomes what Puttenham calls the 'disabler', with the classical\n1V0rid invoked always as a paler, paradoxicallv secondary, imiration. These\nmoments where the Odyssey surfaces - or perhaps rarher, is held under -\nin explicit reference are held in a kind of tension with a more diffuse and\nuncertain network of refraction, where Satan 'like a black mist low creeping'\n(9.180) is suddenly suggestive not only of Thetis in the Iliad (1.359) but also\nof Odysseus swathed in Athene's protective mist (VI.15), and Eve in her gar-\nden is like ausicaa with her washing (vI.85-98) as well as like Patroclus in\nfatal confrontation, in Iliad 16, with a foe larger than had been imagined. In\nthis frame of reference, Odysseus' notorious interest in the Odysse\"y in where\nhis next meal was coming from offers a mundane counterpoint not only to\nthe reality of the temptation of taste but to the whole emphasis rhroughout\nBook 9 on the need for food - a need whose perils will also be exemplified\nin Homeric history by the Lotos-eaters, the cattle of the Sun and Circe.\nIn a surprisingly literal sense Paradise Lost becomes in effect a primer for\nreading Homer - one as thoroughly revisionary as Blake's later reading of\nMilton himself or any later 'readings against the grain'. In this light, the\nreader's own active engagement with and reassessment of the allusive quali-\nties of the poem act as an empirical demonstration of the secondary and sub-\nordinate nature of whatever reserves may be conjured up of pagan learning\nand commentary. Milton argues elsewhere 1n that no learning is necessary to\nexpound the truths of scripture: here, in Paradise Lost, he brings the whole of\nhis creativity to bear in a complex poetic mechanism of intellectual challenge\ngenerating - ultimately, as its most triumphant outcome - the recognition\nand acceptance of moral defeat. Alexander Pope - a man with his own strong\nScriblerian views on the abuses of commentators' commentary, and one who\nin the Essay 011 Criticism (127-8) had recommended 'the Mantuan Muse' as\nthe best comment on Homer - was one reader who found it natural to use\nMilton as well as Virgil in rhis role, On Hera's seduction of Zeus in Iliad 14,\nfor example, he devotes a whole note to 1ilron's various imitations of 'the\n.\" Set, e.g. eo,mduolro,lS Touchrng Ihe l.JkeJ,est Mt';JIIS to Remon' Hircllllgs 0111 ofIhe Church\n(.659),\nl 9\nPENELOPE WILSON\nseveral beautiful parts of this episode': in particular, he notes, 'that which\nseems in Homer an impious ncrion, becomes a mora) lesson in Milton; since\nhe makes that lascivious rage of the passion the immediate effect of the sin\nof our first parents after the fall'. Pope's note does not Stop here, with the\nbald statement: unapologetically, he quotes in his note the whole passage\nfrom Book 9 of Paradise Lost, forcing the revisionary Miltonic filter on to\nHomer's eighteenth-century readers at the same ri_me as elevating the beauty\nof both passages through the juxtaposition.' 7\nThe allusive mode of Paradise Lost operates as a series of tests or challenges\nthrown out to winnow the audience down to the 'few' who are truly 'fit' to\nhear. Even if the thrust is ultimately a simplifying rather than an esoteric\none, it is of course arguable that - in relation to Home~ for example -\nonly those wirh a sufficient pre-existing engagement with Homeric epic\ncan experience the full revisionary paradox enacted through reading. An\nabsence of learning becomes a readedy equivalent of the untested innocence\nrejected in Areopagitica as 'a fugitive and cloistered virtue, unexercised and\nunbreathed'. Pope's 'epic' achievement, by contrast, is a popularising one.\nintent both on rescuing Homer from the depradations and irrelevancies oi\nscholars and critics, and establishing the Homeric poems at the centre of a\nnew literary market-place. The achievement of his processing of Homer is all\nthe more impressive in view of the fact that this was a market better attuned\nto mock-heroic and to the sceptical positions of modernism than to auto\u00b7\nmatic veneration of the monuments of the past. Homer holds a key place in\nany battle of the ancients and the moderns, and Pope's Homer is at one level\na strikingly uccessful engagement in that ongoing controversy. ,8 Pope was\nby no means an uncritical impresario. Although the hyperbolic images of his\n'Preface' to Homer - figuring Homer as 'a wild paradise', a chariot-wheel\nsetting itself on n_re, 13 powerful star, which in the violence of its course. drew\nall things within its vortex' - may strike today's readers as linle short of adu-\nlatory, the preface itself was seen by some of the partisans of the anciellls\nas dangerously attuned to the modern side. Pope's annotations show him\nconstantly adjusting between the grearness he perceives in 'Homer's' poetic\nspirit and the things in the poems which are plainly, or ought to be, unac-\nceptable to the modern age.\" But for Pope it is clear that the relevance\nof the Homeric poems for the modern age far outweighed these difficulties\nof adjustment. This conviction is bodied forth not only in the detail of the\narguments but in the whole strategy of dissemination: the processing of the\n17 Pope (1996) 694-6. III See esp.

Naru-\nrally, Achilles presents a problemaric figure as hero in this respect. Instead\nof the communal loyalties which fuel the spirit of a Diomedes, Achilles' Own\nnative aggression is controlled uniquely by his sense of himself, and so far\ndoes he seem from sharing human sympathies rhar his c10sesr friend Patro-\nc1us speculates (r6.33-5) that rocks and tempesruous seas gave rum birth\nrather than the tenderness of love. His solipsism becomes more emphatic in\nPope. Early in Book r6 Pope's Achilles indulges in a rejection of the notion\nof higher exrernal influences upon his behaviour (such as Jove, or oracles)\nin a supreme assertion of egotism, suggestive of such other individualists as\nShakespeare' Edmund and lago, or Milton's Saran:\nMy \\Vrongs, my \\Vrongs, my conStant Thought engage,\nThose, my sole Oracles, inspire my Rage . ..\nI made him Tyram; gave him Pow'r to wrong\nEv'n me ...\n>'fis time our Fury should relenr at last:\nI fix'd its Dare; rhe da)' I wish'd appears.':'<4\nAnd he finishes hjs speech with a wish for the universal destruction of the\nrest of the Greeks as well as the Trojans - a passage warml)' defended against\nits would-be athetisers by Pope, who marks his interest by drawing a strong\nShakespearean parallel with Northumberland's reaction to the death of Hot-\nspur. '5 In terms of the conflict between individuality and co-operation seen\nby Le Bossu at the poem's heart, Achilles and his opposite number on the\nTrojan side, Hector, offer Pope a textbook contrast. In a poem exposing the\nill effects of discord, Hector has all the qualities tending to a preservation oi\nunity: he stands as a 'character of valour unruffled b)' rage and anger, uniting\nhis people by his prudence and example'. 'The motive of all his acrions' is\nlove of his country, together with affection towards his parents and kindred.\nincluding his wife and son. He is perhaps the acme of successful interperson-\nality - though not quite in the modern sense of Pope's nice phrase, 'Hector\nappears in every Battel the Life and Soul of his Parry'. ,6\n':'J Pope ('996) 2.59.

'7 The\npassage on which I shall focus here is Pope's version of the end of Hector's\nsoliloquy before the Scaean gate as he weighs up the possibilities of retreat,\npatley or combat with Achilles. It comes early in the twenty-second book of\nthe Iliad, a book which Pope identifies as one of the most 'over-mastering'\nin its dialectic of the sublime and the sentimental: 'And indeed tbro' the\nwhole Book this wonderful COntraSt and Opposition of the Moving and\nrhe Terrible, i perpetually kept up, each heightening the other: I can't find\nWords to express how so great Beauties affect me.\"8 The passage (22.126-\n8) is obscure in the Greek, some proverbial usage probably hidden in its\nexpression. Pope gives a literal version: 'There is no talking with Achilles,\nfrom an Oak, or from a Rock, as a young Man and a Maiden talk together,\nand also a paraphrase: 'There is no conversing with this implacable Enemy\nin rhe Rage of Bartel; as when sauntring People talk ar leisure to one another\non rhe Road, or when young Men and Women meet in a Field.\". It is an\nextraordinarily moving 'beauty' of exactly the kind Pope has pointed to,\nHector's mind, as he ('like a coiled serpent') awairs rhe gleaming rage of\nthe onrushing Achilles, suddenly reverting to a pastoral peacetime scene.\nFleeringly, before the inevitable choice of glory over safety, Hector seems to be\nenvisaging the pas ibility that he and Achilles mighr drop out of the domain\nof epic confrontation - not just formally or ritualisrically, with exchange\nof gifts, as do Glaucus and Diomedes in Book 6, bur into another world\naltogether where they might casually and simply be friends.\n\\\"(\/e greet nm he.re, as Man conversing Man\nMer at an Oak, or journeying 0 'cr <\\ Plain;\no Season now for calm f:uniliar Talk.\nLike Yourhs and Maidens in an Evening \\Xfalk:\n\\'(laf is our business. to\n:- NOfC' on Book 2.2.. 2.69: Pope (1996) l.On-S.\n: NOIC' on Book l.2.. 37: Pope (1996) I,OJO.\n:, o[e on Book 1.1., 167: Pope (19961 1.0.U-;.\n10 Book ~2, 167-72: POp( (1996) 1,016.

It is an\noddity of literary history that in giving voice so consummately in some way\nto the 'group-consciousness of an age'}l Pope's ver ion of Homer quickly\nbecomes a rrigger for irs own srylisric rejection, and for a movement variously\nback to the Greek (for those who could manage it), to the literal, or to\nChapmanY Let Homer's readers think, urges Pope in his 'Preface', that\n'they are growing acquainted with nations and people that are now no more:\nthat they are stepping almost three thousand years back into the remoreS!\nantiquity': but in a sense Pope brought Homer roo close, and that was not,\nultimately, what the next age wanted, with its appetite for nostalgia and\nesrrangement. Pope did more, of course, than rurn Homer into a speaker of\neighreenth-century poetic diction: his erasing of stylistic difference is only\none aspecr of a larger campaign to secure recognirion for Homer as above\nall the greatesr of fellow poets. In projecring forward acceptance of rhis\npremise he was ulrimarely far more successful, ro the point where one might\nsee his Homeric contriburion as partially ar leasr a powerful pre-emptive\nsrrike againsr the distancing effect of the new sense of historical difference.\nThomas Parnell's 'Essay on the life, writings and learning of Homer', prefixed\nto Pope's Iliad, opens wirh a vision of lirerary influence as in it elf a kind of\nfriendship.\nThere is somerhing in me Mind of Man, which goes beyond bare Curiosiry,\nand even carries us on to a Shadow of Friendship, with those great Genius's\nwhom we have known to excell in former Ages. or will it appear less\nto anyone, who considers how much it partakes of the Nature of Friend-\nship; how it compounds itself of an Admiration rais'd by what we meet\n)1 The phrase IS from lill)'ard (1958) 'S.
