Birth interval is a major determinant of rates of fertility, and is also\na measure of parental investment in a child. In this paper the length of the\nbirth interval in a traditional African population is analysed by sex of children.\nBirth intervals after the birth of a boy were significantly longer than after the\nbirth of a girl, indicating higher parental investment in boys. However, in\nwomen of high parity, this differential disappeared. Birth intervals for women\nwith no son were shorter than for those with at least one son. All these results\nare compatible with an evolutionary analysis of reproductive decision-making.\nFirst born sons have particularly high reproductive success, daughters have\naverage reproductive success and late born sons have low reproductive success.\nThe birth interval follows a similar trend, suggesting that longer birth intervals\nrepresent higher maternal investment in children of high reproductive\npotential.\nIntroduction\nThe interval between births is a major determinant of levels of fertility in high fertility\npopulations. From an evolutionary perspective, it is also a measure of parental\ninvestment in a child. Parental investment is anything parents give to their children that\nbenefits the future reproductive success of that child at a potential cost to the parent\n(Trivers, 1972). A long birth interval sacrifices time in which a mother could be\nproducing more children, in order to enhance the development of an existing child.\nMany studies have shown that children born after short birth intervals are at risk of\nhigher morbidity and mortality (e.g. Blurton-Jones, 1986; Cleland & Sathar, 1984;\nHobcraft, McDonald & Rutstein, 1985; Curtis, Diamond & McDonald, 1993; Alam,\n1995). Birth interval is frequently correlated with the duration of breast-feeding.\nBreast-milk is a safe and nutritious source of food for an infant. Weaning frequently\nintroduces a child to a range of new diseases and the threat of malnutrition. The birth\nof a younger sibling can have an immediate detrimental effect on the morbidity and\nmortality of its elder sibling (Bohler & Bergstrom, 1995). Thus there is competition\nbetween young children for the investment of their parents, particularly mothers, in\nBiosocial Science Article 255 Revise 1st proof 1.8.97\nJ. biosoc. Sci. (1997) 29, 499\u2013507\n\u0002 1997 Cambridge University Press Printed in the United Kingdom\n499\nterms of both food, and probably other factors such as care and attention. There is\nalso evidence of competition between older siblings for food, as small families are\nassociated with lower rates of mortality (e.g. Ronsmans, 1995; LeGrand & Phillips,\n1996). Thus, children born both before and after a long birth interval are likely to\nbenefit throughout childhood, and possibly beyond, in terms of the resources available\nto them from their family. The length of the birth interval thus indicates how a\nparticular child may be fairing in the competition for parental, and particularly\nmaternal, resources at a crucial time in its development.\nBackground\nThis paper examines data on birth spacing from Gabbra pastoralists, a traditional\ngroup of nomadic camel herders who live in the north of Kenya. The area they inhabit\nis arid and prone to drought (Mace, 1993). The nomads live remote from government\nservices. A demographic survey of about 850 families, comprising over 5000 people,\nwas conducted in 1993 (Mace, 1996a). Birth histories were recorded, in conjunction\nwith marriage histories, and information on the number of animals in the household\nherd. Fertility is high: TFR\u00025\u00b763 (Mace & Sear, 1996). Herding is the main source of\nincome in nomadic families, and camels are the key species. Number of adult female\ncamels owned by the household herd provided a simple measure of the wealth of\npastoralist households. The society is patrilineal and patrilocal. Polygyny is limited.\nAbout 88% of women were the only living wife of their husband.\nMace (1996b) shows that most polygyny is related to the desire for a male child.\nThe probability that a man takes a second wife is strongly, negatively correlated with\nthe number of children, particularly sons, that his first wife had. Remarriage is the\ndecision of the man, and women were frequently unhappy about it. Thus this can be\ntaken as evidence that men wish to continue to reproduce until they have at least one\nson, but does not necessarily reveal the preferences of women. For evidence of gender\npreferences in women, this paper examines birth intervals. The decision to have another\nbaby is likely to be a combined decision of husband and wife. As weaning a child is in\nthe domain of the mother, mothers may have considerable control over the spacing of\nbirths.\nResults\nEffect of the sex of a baby on birth interval\nFigure 1 shows the mean length of completed birth intervals in ever-married\nGabbra women of all ages, who had provided a birth history and had had at least two\nbirths. Only birth intervals where the child that opened the birth interval survived are\nincluded. Mothers very frequently omitted to report the birth of babies that died in\ninfancy, so all birth intervals over 5 years were excluded from analysis, as they may\nhave included another birth on which there was no information. Birth intervals after\nboys are longer than birth intervals after girls. The difference is about 2 months, but\nhighly statistically significant.\nWhether the sex of the baby that closed the birth interval influenced its length was\nalso investigated. Low (1991) found that birth intervals ending with a boy were\nBiosocial Science Article 255\nR. Mace and R. Sear500\nFig. 1.

She argues that if mothers are in a\nphysiologically depleted state soon after producing a boy, some physiological\nmechanism may selectively favour female fetuses over male fetuses in the next\npregnancy, increasing the chances that male fetuses survive to birth. The present results\nare in the same direction, with boy\u2013boy intervals being the longest and girl\u2013girl\nintervals the shortest, but the effect of the sex of the latter child is tiny. Table 1 shows\nthat birth intervals after boys were significantly longer, taking account of age of\nmother, but the sex of the child closing the birth interval had no significant effect.\nThe analysis of closed birth intervals can be subject to censoring bias: long birth\nintervals are less likely to be completed and therefore excluded from the analysis.\nHazard model analysis enables all the data, including data from birth intervals that are\nstill open, to be used and thus enables a more accurate analysis of the effect of\nBiosocial Science Article 255\nAn evolutionary analysis of birth interval 501\nTable 2.

Table 2 shows the results of a hazard models analysis of the effect\nof the sex of the child on the length of the birth interval for all birth intervals and for\neach parity. Only married women of 49 years of age or younger are included in the\nsample. A male child is followed by a longer birth interval for all of the first five birth\nintervals, but only significantly so for interval 2.\nSwenson & Thang (1993) report a rather similar result in a far more heterogeneous\nsample of Vietnamese women, with lower average fertility than the Gabbra, when they\nfind birth intervals after boys were longer in the first and second birth interval, but not in\nhigher parity women. They interpret the absence of such an effect in higher parity mothers\neither as mothers already having the number of sons they require or a breakdown of\nactive reproductive decision-making. The former explanation is thought to be more likely.\nThe birth interval may be adjusted either biologically, such as a woman becoming\nfertile only after recovering some level of physiological condition, or by conscious\ndecision, such as to resume sexual activity or wean an infant. These mechanisms are\nnot mutually exclusive. Whether either or both of these mechanisms are operating, a\nlong birth interval after a boy may represent greater maternal investment in her sons.\nArnold (1993) reports no general trend in the reported length of post-partum sexual\nabstinence after the birth of boys or girls, in a sample of demographic surveys from\ndeveloping countries, but does not explicitly investigate birth intervals.

The survival function of birth intervals for mothers with no sons (solid line), no\ndaughters (dashed line) and at least one son and one daughter (dotted line). All birth\nintervals except the first are included, for ever-married women up to 49 years of age.\nAltmann & Ober (1993) found that the duration of breast-feeding and the interval to\nthe next pregnancy were shorter after the birth of a son in North American Hutterites.\nThe authors interpret this result as indicative of greater parental investment in\ndaughters; however, as safe milk supplements and weaning foods are available in North\nAmerica, such a result could be a means by which mothers switched hungrier and larger\ninfants (i.e. boys) on to alternative foods at an earlier age, either because they felt the\nbaby would benefit or to relieve tiredness in the mother; so such a result can be\ninterpreted in either way with respect to sex-biases in parental investment.\nInfluence of family composition on birth interval\nThe influence of the sex composition of all the previous, surviving children on the\nlength of the birth interval was further investigated. Figure 2 shows a survival function\nof the length of birth interval, a Kaplan\u2013Meier plot, of all birth intervals after the first\none, for women with children of both sexes, with only daughters and with only sons.\nWomen with children of both sexes had the longest birth intervals; women with only\ndaughters had the shortest birth intervals; but women with only sons had shorter birth\nintervals than women with at least one daughter and a son. All lines differ significantly\nfrom each other, according to tests on the Kaplan\u2013Meier plot. A full hazards analysis,\nusing Cox\u2019s regression and taking into account the age of the mother, found that those\nwith no son had shorter birth intervals than those with a son, but failed to find a\nsignificant difference between those with all sons and those with at least one daughter\nBiosocial Science Article 255\nAn evolutionary analysis of birth interval 503\nTable 3.

Table 3 (model c) also shows that the total number of sons has a\nhighly significant influence on the length of the birth interval, taking account of age of\nmother, whereas simple parity does not.\nIf birth intervals after boys are longer, then, on average, mothers with many sons\nwill be slightly older than mothers with only daughters, and thus potentially less fertile.\nHowever, the effect of not having a son is significant, even accounting for the age of\nthe mother. Thus the determination of the birth interval is not simply an effect of\nmaternal age. Further, the suggestion from Fig. 2 that those with no daughter also have\nslightly shorter birth intervals could not be explained by any obvious mechanism that\nis purely physiological. These results strongly suggest that parents are making active\ndecisions with respect to the length of the birth interval, even in a society with no access\nto artificial methods of contraception.\nGadalla, McCarthy & Campbell (1985) found that the number of sons a woman had\nin her first two births was a very significant predictor of whether or not that woman would\nuse contraception, in an Egyptian population. The more sons women had, the more likely\nthey were to use contraception. More recent studies from Asia have found that the length\nof the third birth interval is similarly influenced by the number of sons a woman had in her\nfirst two births (Nath & Land, 1994; Pong, 1994). These studies all interpret the length of\nthe birth interval as a measure of the woman\u2019s eagerness to have another baby; the result\nis attributed to son preference. Rahman &DaVanzo (1993) find such son preference and\nalso find \u2018daughter preference\u2019, in that women with no daughters appear to want at least\none daughter in Matlab, Bangladesh. Arnold (1993) reports that a stated desire by\nmothers to continue reproducing if they did not have at least one son and one daughter is\nnow the most commonly stated preference by parents from a large sample of developing\ncountries. The present study provides evidence that such preferences are influencing birth\nintervals in a traditional, non-contracepting population in sub-Saharan Africa.\nBiosocial Science Article 255\nR. Mace and R. Sear504\nFig. 3. The relative reproductive success of ever-married male and female Gabbra as a\nfunction of the number of same-sex elder siblings in their natal families (adapted from\ndata in Mace, 1996a).\nConclusion and discussion\nVariation in the birth interval is interpreted as variation in parental investment.\nEvidence from the length of the birth interval suggests that maternal investment in male\ninfants is greater than that in female, except at high parity. Evidence from birth\nintervals also shows strong evidence that couples are likely to continue to reproduce\nuntil they have at least one son. There is a strong suggestion that they also would like\na daughter, although the effect on birth intervals is not significant.\nFigure 3 shows the reproductive success of married, Gabbra adults as a function of\ntheir position in the birth order in their natal family. For females, number of elder\nsisters does not influence their reproductive potential, but for males the number of elder\nbrothers has a highly significant negative effect on reproductive success. First born sons\ntend to have high reproductive potential, are given larger herds by their family at the\nfoundation of their own household and are married earlier than later born sons (Mace,\n1996a). Short birth intervals occur when parents are eager for a first born son. When\nthey already have a number of sons, they are not eager for more (because late born\nsons have low reproductive potential) and birth intervals increase. Whilst a large\nnumber of daughters is not deleterious to parental reproductive success, and would\nappear to result in a higher mean reproductive success than a large number of sons, a\nstrategy of continuing to reproduce to gain more daughters would not enhance fitness\nif one already had some sons, because the sex of a child cannot be predetermined. The\naverage fitness of late born children (boys and girls combined) decreases after each son\nBiosocial Science Article 255\nAn evolutionary analysis of birth interval 505\nis born, hence the importance of the effect of number of existing sons on the length of\nthe birth interval. It is suggested here that the patterns observed in birth intervals in\nthis traditional African population, some of which are similar to those described in\nother, mostly Asian populations, can all be understood as an evolved strategy of\nhighest maternal investment in those children of highest reproductive potential.\nAcknowledgments\nThis research was funded by the Royal Society, and a grant from the EC (DG XII) to\nIIED (London).\nReferences\nAlam, M.
