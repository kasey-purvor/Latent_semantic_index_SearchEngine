B. Twidale, D. M. Nichols, J. A. Mariani, T. Rodden and R Sawyer\nComputing Department Lancaster University\nWe describe the implications of a study of database browsing behaviour for the development of a\nsystem to support more effective browsing. In particular we consider the importance of\ncollaborative working, both in learning browsing skills and in co-operating on a shared\ninformation-retrieval task. From our study, we believe that an interface to support collaboration\nshould promote the awareness of the activities of others, better visualization of the information\ndata structures being browsed, and effective communication of the browsing process.\nIntroduction\nThe proliferation of databases has led to a growing demand for skills in navigating and\nmanipulating them. These skills are important not just in order to undertake study and\nresearch in Higher Education, but as an important transferable skill likely to be expected\nby industry and commerce of all graduates. We are developing a system that can more\neffectively support the browsing of library databases. In particular we are interested in\ndeveloping an interface to support the process of collaborative browsing.\nWe have made a study (Twidale et al, 1994) of the requirements of such an interface,\nchiefly to inform our design intuitions. The study has involved a substantial literature\nsurvey, interviews with subject librarians, and small-scale in-depth studies of authentic\nbrowsing activities undertaken by library users. The latter involved observing remote\ncollaboration using existing simple tools including Unix Talk in order to reveal the\nproblems that a more sophisticated system should address.\nThe use of library resources is stereotyped as a solitary activity, with hardly any mention\nin the library science and information retrieval literature on the social aspects of\ninformation systems. However, our study indicates notable collaboration, with users\nconsulting both library staff and each other. Informal computer-based collaboration\nalready exists through sharing or leaning over terminals and pointing at screens.\n75\nM. B. Twiddle et al. Database browsing techniques\nTraditionally, as computer scientists, we have designed databases to appear as single-user\nsystems. We aim to build a system to support more active collaboration.\nBrowsing\nWhereas some information scientists use the term browsing in a very restricted and precise\nmanner, we use it to describe all search activities that involve a level of imprecision about\nthe desired outcome of the search (Bates, 1989). A critical feature is that users refine their\nrequirements over time as more information becomes available and set subgoals to satisfy\nthem. The literature on browsing backs up our observations of its importance to library\nusers as well as the problems that novices have. Researchers have stressed the importance\nof serendipity and its effective exploitation in the browsing process (Rice, 1988). But it\nalso seems that expertise makes you luckier! This may be because an expert is better able\nto recognize and exploit the accidental find. There are two types of relevant expertise:\ngeneric knowledge of browsing techniques, and local knowledge of the subject area being\nexplored. In addition, browsing involves two different kinds of skill: tactics, which are\nactions relating to the composition of a single query, and strategy, which involves actions\nin managing a sequence of queries. Examples of tactics are the use of Boolean operators,\nkeywords, wildcards and indexes. Strategic skills include choosing the right database,\nrestricting or widening a search, and managing your evolving set of goals and subgoals.\nBrowsing tactics involve knowledge that can be unique to a single database system, and\ntheir transfer between the many and constantly evolving systems that learners use is\ndifficult. This is a frequent complaint both of users and of information professionals\n(Yee, 1991). By contrast, the strategies, being more abstract, transfer better and are the\nkinds of generic transferable skills that students should acquire. Unfortunately, this very\nabstraction can also make their acquisition all the more complex and their consideration\nmay be masked by the more visible issues of tactics.\nLearning about the system\nNovices may have misconceptions about the browsing process. These can include an\ninappropriate overview or metaphor of the search process. An example we observed was\nconsidering an Online Public Access Catalogue (OPAC) system as analogous to an\nintelligent colleague. Associated with such a misconception will be a set of beliefs, such\nthat results are presented in some order of importance, or that a 'common sense' filter will\nhave been applied. For example, a novice with the 'intelligent colleague' misconception\nwould find it bizarre that a search on the word browse will return references to the\nbehaviour of reindeer, and consequently distrust any use of the search system as being so\nstupid as to be utterly flawed.\nInformation systems are complex, and it is entirely appropriate that novices learn a\nminimal subset of the available facilities to enable them to do some limited searching.\nUnfortunately, this can lead to users who are confident in their use of the system but who\nhave settled into sub-optimal work patterns. Examples of these are: getting several\n76\nALT-] Volume 3 Number I\nhundred hits and reading them all, failing to look at all the results when there are a\nreasonable number, and failing to pursue a lead or revise a strategy. Users may settle into\nthese patterns either because they are unaware of the more sophisticated methods or\nbecause they choose not to use or practise them, due for example to cognitive overload\n(Rudd & Rudd, 1986). Therefore, in addition to providing them with an introduction to\nthat subset, we must consider issues of how they can continue their learning of more\nadvanced features. The process of continuing learning involves experimentation, blind\ntrial and error, asking experts for help, informal learning from colleagues, and advice\nbeing volunteered by experts as a part of a consultation about a domain issue.\nPotential losses from computerization\nComputerized library databases offer features not available in traditional library\ninformation structures (such as keyword searching and the ability to work remotely), but\nthey may also lose some useful features. These include the spatial nature of the way\ninformation is presented in a library: the ability to walk round the bookstacks and to\nexploit our powerful spatial memory abilities (Beheshti, 1992).\nThe organization of bookstacks can also facilitate browsing: a searched-for book on a\nshelf will have related books near to it that can be equally or even more relevant to the\nuser's vague and constantly evolving information needs. An electronic view of informa-\ntion is remarkably impoverished compared with the vast amount of peripheral\ninformation of real books. These include the ease of seeing whether a book is brand new,\nwell thumbed, borrowed a lot, or ancient but never consulted (Mitev, 1989). People also\nhave well-developed spatial awareness and memory skills that can be exploited in\nnavigating a physical library and in supporting the retrieval of information by its position\n(Chang & Rice, 1993). However, not everything is easily accessible in a physical library.\nFor example, at Lancaster the Librarianship section is not on open access, and one\ncannot physically browse the books on browsing! Furthermore, one naturally cannot\nbrowse the shelves for books that others have borrowed. Even the old-fashioned card-\nindex file can convey peripheral information from nearby cards, the colour and degree of\nageing of the card and even how dog-eared it is. Such physical information structures\nenable the browser to get a sense of the size of the related information.\nCollaboration issues\nIt is not just the inanimate contents of a traditional library that convey useful\ninformation. People can also be useful to a browser. One can observe and learn from the\nbrowsing techniques of others, discuss issues with co-learners or with subject experts, and\nalso be aware of the activities of others that may be of interest and relevance to one's own\nwork. For example, upon seeing a colleague in an unexpected part of the library, one\nmight choose to ask what she has found there. Similarly, upon seeing someone in 'your'\narea, you may decide to introduce yourself as someone also interested in that field. A\ncomputerized library that is accessed remotely will lack these advantages unless we take\nsteps to re-introduce them into the system.\n77\nAI \u00df. Twiddle et al. Database browsing techniques\nResearch in Computer Supported Co-operative Work employs a useful classification of\ncollaboration (Rodden, 1991). Collaboration may be remote or co-located, as well as\nbeing synchronous or asynchronous. In conventional libraries, we can consider most co-\noperation to be co-located and synchronous, but the computerization process makes the\nother permutations possible, while offering new opportunities for the first.\nWe envisage a number of scenarios in which the system being developed might be used in\nan educational context. In all cases, the interaction may be synchronous (participants\nworking at the same time) or asynchronous (participants leaving messages for each\nother):\n\u2022 Expert consultancy. A learner is browsing the database and decides that she is not\nmaking the progress she would like. In a physical library, she might go and talk to the\nsubject librarian. For the database use, she may wish to communicate by telephone or\nemail (or even ultimately by video link). The expert calls up a representation of the\nstudent's browsing history and composes suitable advice. This advice can be specific,\ngeneral and remedial. It can help to solve the current task, explain a generic browsing\ntechnique and also correct any apparent misconceptions. As part of the explanation,\nthe expert passes on an annotated browsing procedure which the student can view and\neven use on her terminal.\n\u2022 A 'language laboratory' for database skills. A number of individual learners are\nbrowsing a database as part of a practical class on database-browsing skills. They may\nall be in the same teaching room, or working remotely on their own terminals\nelsewhere. The expert can observe the browsing activities of the students in turn, and\noffer advice as necessary.\n\u2022 Collaborative browsing for learners. Small groups of learners who have a similar\nbrowsing task make use of the awareness mechanisms to monitor and discuss the\nprogress and activity of each other. This is known to be a useful learning activity both\nfor the questioner (who asks questions such as 'Why are you doing that?'), and for the\nrespondent who has to reflect on her action in order to generate a suitable explanation.\n\u2022 Serendipitous meetings. If the groups in the case immediately above are made larger,\ndatabase awareness can be a useful tool for supporting serendipitous meetings of the\nkind that naturally occur in physical libraries where strangers meet by browsing the\nsame bookstack and finding common interests for collaboration, or when finding that\na book they want is already being used by someone else, who therefore might be worth\ntalking to. Now, one can become aware when others are, or have been, browsing the\nsame parts of the database.\nWe are working on an interface to support collaborative browsing. Our study will inform\nthe initial version of our interface, and one of our findings we believe to be particularly\nimportant. Collaborative working implies a need to share information: both the end\nproduct (the hits) and the process (the search strategy\/tactics). Similarly, there is a need to\nshare this information with the librarians, for whom inspection of the search process can\n78\nVolume 3 Number I\nreveal not only gaps in the users' browsing techniques but also an indication of their\ndegree of searching sophistication. In addition, an externalized representation of the\nsearch process reduces cognitive load and facilitates reflection, a vital component of\nlearning. An initial analogy would be the Unix history list, but the actual representation\nwill need to be considerably more sophisticated and flexible.\nConclusion\nIt seems that collaboration issues have not been addressed in OPAC design. We believe\nthat an interface that takes them into account in providing visualization features will\ngreatly facilitate both the learning and exercise of browsing skills.\nAcknowledgements\nFinancial support for the research reported in this paper was provided by a grant from\nthe JISC New Technologies Initiative.\nReferences\nBates, M.J.
