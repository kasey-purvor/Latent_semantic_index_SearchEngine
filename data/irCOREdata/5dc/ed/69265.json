Introduction\n[2] Lava domes are large rock masses that form complex,\nchanging shapes as they grow. They are intrinsically unsta-\nble, producing talus slopes from rockfall mass wasting and\ngenerating pyroclastic flows from larger episodes of grav-\nitational collapse that expose pressurized lava to the atmo-\nsphere. Such collapses tend to occur where new lava is\nadded to the surface, a process that is important from the\nperspective of hazard evaluation [Calder et al., 2002]. The\nrate at which the dome grows is of similar significance,\nbecause a hotter, more pressurized interior, which may\nresult from a high effusion rate, can be more liable to\nexplosive disintegration. Consequently, the measurement of\nshape, locus of growth and lava extrusion rate are all of\ncritical importance to understanding the process of lava\ndome growth and, in order to calculate the total extrusion\nrate, simultaneous measurements of all the mass wasting\ndeposits must also be carried out.\n[3] However, such comprehensive measurements are sel-\ndom possible due to lack of close access, the dome being\nobscured by cloud, and pyroclastic flow deposits (often\nlocated in valley bottoms) being unobservable from many\nremote viewing locations. Opportunistic measurements us-\ning optical instruments (e.g., lidar surveys [Jones, 2006])\nare generally too infrequent, due to cloud cover, to capture\ndome growth dynamics. In this paper we describe the\ndeployment of a portable ground-based radar instrument\n(AVTIS, All-weather Volcano Topographic Imaging Sensor),\nto make a continuous time series of topographic measure-\nments of the growing dome at Soufrie`re Hills, Montserrat. To\naccount for mass wasting from the dome, the results are\ncombined with simultaneous assessments of rockfall and\npyroclastic deposit volumes made from seismic and photo-\ngraphic data. This has allowed the total extrusion rate to be\nestimated, and has also provided the relative proportions by\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 113, B08210, doi:10.1029\/2007JB005466, 2008\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Environmental Systems Science Centre, University of Reading,\nReading, UK.\n2School of Physics and Astronomy, University of St. Andrews, St.\nAndrews, UK.\n3Lancaster Environment Centre, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK.\n4Montserrat Volcano Observatory, Flemmings, Montserrat, West Indies.\n5British Geological Survey, Edinburgh, UK.\nCopyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/08\/2007JB005466$09.00\nB08210 1 of 15\nwhich the extruded lava was being partitioned into talus,\npyroclastic flow deposits and lava dome \u2018\u2018core.\u2019\u2019\n[4] AVTIS is a millimeter-wave dual-mode radar\/radiometer\n(radarometer) instrument [Macfarlane and Robertson, 2004]\nthat can image topography and map surface temperature\nvariations, through clear air or cloud (its technical capabilities\nare summarized in Table 1). Thus, at frequently cloud-covered\nvolcanoes such as Soufrie`re Hills, the instrument is capable\nof obtaining a time series of topographic measurements\nwith a frequency and continuity not possible by other\ntechniques. AVTIS has been used previously at Montserrat\nto record topography and to estimate the extrusion rate and\ntemperature of the dome lava [Wadge et al., 2005, 2006],\nand to measure lava flow advance at Arenal, Costa Rica\n[Macfarlane et al., 2006]. The data set described here,\ncollected over two weeks in March to April 2006, repre-\nsents the first dense time series of a growing lava dome.\n[5] The current eruption of Soufrie`re Hills Volcano began\nin 1995, and has produced a series of Pele\u00b4ean lava domes\nof andesitic composition within a crater (English\u2019s Crater)\nopen to the east northeast [Watts et al., 2002] (Figure 1).\nThese domes, fed from a central conduit within the crater,\nhave been destroyed by collapse and explosion, usually\nproducing pyroclastic flows, and have regrown repeatedly\nduring three episodes of lava extrusion (1995\u20131998; 1999\u2013\n2003; 2005\u20132007). Six weeks after the field campaign\nreported here, the lava dome was destroyed on 20 May\n2006, with most of the material being deposited in the sea\nto the east. At times during the ongoing twelve-year\neruption, the dome at Soufrie`re Hills has grown up to\n1000 m in diameter and up to 400\u2013450 m in height. The\nelevation of the crater floor at the conduit vent is about\n700 m above sea level (asl) and the rim of the crater is at\nabout 800 m asl. The elevations of both the crater floor and\nthe northeastern crater rim fall toward the sea to the east\nnortheast. As the dome grows within the crater, any\npyroclastic flows and rockfalls are constrained by the crater\nwalls until the summit of the dome reaches an elevation of\nabout 950 m asl [Wadge, 2008]. Above this, talus can spill\nout over the crater rim. At the time of the observations\nreported here the summit of the dome was at an elevation\nof 900\u2013950 m asl and the talus was still contained within\nthe crater (Figure 2).\n[6] During the early stages of development, a dome\ntypically grows as a contiguous flowing mass. Such endog-\nenous growth is later replaced by exogenous additions of\nlava at the surface via shear-bounded surfaces through the\nearlier lava mass (Figure 2). This mechanism allows the\nlocus of extrusion to switch from one side of the dome to\nanother [Watts et al., 2002]. Surrounding the lava core of\nthe dome is an apron of talus at an angle of repose of about\n37\u0001, derived from disintegration of blocks of lava from the\ntop of the dome. This talus forms an increasingly large\nproportion of the whole dome as it grows. There are two\nmain surficial processes that result in morphological change\nof the exogenous lava dome: addition of lava as contiguous\nmasses or large (\u000110 m) blocks at the top of the dome, and\nthe fragmentation of this lava to produce talus by rockfall\nand pyroclastic flow deposits.\n[7] Rockfalls, and the avalanches they generate, are rapid\nmovements of rock mass under gravity, and originate on\nsteep slopes. The dimensions of the rockfall at source are\nlargely defined by the jointing in the rock mass, and the\nfailure of a large mass (longest dimension >10 m) may be\nfollowed by disintegration along its joint planes. Individual\nrocks may bounce, slide or roll down the slope. They may\nalso collide with each other and these events, if numerous\nenough, can generate a granular mass in a state of mechan-\nical fluidization. Experiments show that rocks at the front of\nsuch a mass accelerate forward as a result of this process,\nand rocks at the rear decelerate [Okura et al., 2000]. This\nresults in a greater areal coverage of deposit than would be\nthe case if the rocks fell individually. In addition, rock clasts\nmay also fragment under shear stress, particularly at pres-\nsure and depth in the flow [Davies et al., 1999]. This\nfragmentation process will itself create an additional dis-\npersive stress that, like the mechanical fluidization process,\nwill tend to cause the avalanche mass to inflate and spread.\n[8] Rockfall from active lava bodies, as at Soufrie`re Hills,\nhas the additional factor of vesicular gas within the rock.\nThis pressurized gas can lead to a sort of rapid exfoliation of\nthe hot lava surface, producing ash [Calder et al., 2002], a\nprocess also observed at other lava domes such as Unzen\n[Sato et al., 1992]. Calder et al. [2002] distinguished\nbetween \u2018\u2018passively generated\u2019\u2019 rockfalls derived from the\ncold carapace of the dome that are deposited to form the\ntalus, and \u2018\u2018actively generated\u2019\u2019 rockfalls derived from\nfreshly extruded lava fronts. The former were seen as being\nlargely degassed, with runouts rarely extending beyond\n500 m from the source and with an upper volume of about\n103 m3, the latter as being gas-rich and grading into small\npyroclastic flows. Auto-fragmentation is therefore probably\nthe dominant process in both the generation and mobility of\npyroclastic density currents derived from lava dome col-\nlapse and also in the long runout character of large rockfall\navalanches [Davies et al., 1999].\n[9] The AVTIS data enabled estimates to be made of the\nnew core lava and the talus volumes, but the more widely\ndispersed and low-lying pyroclastic flow deposits could not\nbe imaged and thus their volumes had to be calculated\nindirectly. The seismicity associated with rockfall and small\npyroclastic flows was monitored and the signal duration of\nthese events, together with some camera-based field obser-\nvations for calibration, was used as a proxy measure of\npyroclastic flow runout distance and volume. Section 2 of\nthis paper discusses the AVTIS observational methods and\nthe techniques employed with the seismicity data. These\nresults are presented in section 3 as a daily aggregated time\nTable 1.

Observations\n2.1. AVTIS\n[10] The AVTIS measurements were made from two main\nsites on the eastern side of the volcano, Jack Boy Hill (JBH)\nand Runway, both to the north northeast of the dome\n(Figure 1). From these sites the northeastern sector of the\ndome and part of the talus slope which was visible above\nthe crater rim in the foreground (Figure 2) could be\nobserved. The direction of lava extrusion during the mea-\nsurement period was to the east or southeast, so lava\nextruding near the summit of the dome tended to be pushed\nout and fell downslope in a dispersed fan of material, some\nof which became obscured from AVTIS by the crater wall.\n[11] AVTIS images topography by measuring the direc-\ntion and range to the ground surface along a line-of-sight\n(LOS), taking about 0.25 seconds to send and receive the\nradar signal, record the data and increment the radar to its\nnext measurement direction, giving an acquisition time of\nabout 20 minutes for a typical 100 by 50 pixel range image.\nThe returned signal received by AVTIS is quantized into\n8192 bins and converted into range, with each bin repre-\nsenting 0.85 m. The JBH and Runway sites were the closest\n(\u00016 km) practical, safe, vantage points for multiple occu-\npation, but almost at the operational limit of the instrument\n(\u00017 km). At ranges of \u00016 km, the reduction in return signal\nstrength, and hence signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), reduces the\naccuracy with which the range to the surface can be\nretrieved. At ranges of \u00013 km (as measured, for example,\nfrom St George\u2019s Hill, SGH; Figure 1) the typical return\nsignal from the volcano has an SNR of about 8.5 dB,\nresulting in a range uncertainty for a single LOS given by\na standard deviation of about 3 m. At ranges of \u00016 km, the\nSNR falls to about \u00040.35 dB and the range uncertainty\nincreases to about 12.5 m.\n[12] The instantaneous field of view of the radar, or\nfootprint, on the volcano\u2019s surface is determined by the\nradar beam width (0.5\u0001), which corresponds to an effective\ndiameter of \u000152 m at a range of 6 km. However, because\nthe dome surface is not orthogonal to the radar LOS, the\nfootprint will be larger and noncircular. Within a typical\nfootprint on the dome the individual scatterers (e.g., lava\nblock facets) will be distributed irregularly and will con-\ntribute variably to the strength and effective range of the\nreturn signal. Filtering of the radar signal to remove the\neffect of these localized scatters gives a better measurement\nof the range to the bulk topography [Macfarlane and\nRobertson, 2006] but, at long ranges with low SNR, the\nrange bin chosen to represent the radar footprint can be\ndominated by the position of the scatterer with the largest\nradar cross section, rather than that most central to the\nfootprint (Figure 3). Although the radar beam width is 0.5\u0001,\nthe angular stepping used in this study was 0.1\u0001 in both\nazimuth and elevation, and this oversampling helped to\nreduce the noise in the resulting surface retrieval.\n[13] For each site occupation, which typically consisted\nof several hours of repeated image acquisition with the same\ninstrumental setup, the instrument was set on a leveled\ntripod at a position known by differential GPS. AVTIS does\nnot have an internal reference for absolute orientation of the\nFigure 3. Schematic of the field deployment of AVTIS. The distant lava dome is imaged as a raster built\nup from the bottom (arrow) using a pan-and-tilt gimbal. C1 and C2 are tripod-mounted corner cube\nreflectors at distances of several hundred meters used to provide absolute pointing knowledge for AVTIS.\nThe top left panel shows a schematic cross section through the footprint of the radar beam on the dome\nsurface during a single LOS measurement. Rnear and Rfar are the near and far ranges of the footprint and\nRdominant is the dominant reflector whose range will be taken as the range value for that LOS\nmeasurement.\nB08210 WADGE ET AL.: GROWTH OF A LAVA DOME AND TALUS\n4 of 15\nB08210\nradar beam, so absolute pointing knowledge was deter-\nmined using two or more tripod-mounted corner-cube\nreflectors placed at distances up to several hundred meters\nfrom the instrument (Figure 3). These reflectors had their\npositions measured by differential GPS and were left in the\nfield for the duration of the campaign. The known antenna\npattern of AVTIS was identified in the radar data, giving the\nazimuth and elevation radar coordinates of both reflectors.\nComparison with the GPS data then allowed the absolute\norientation of AVTIS to be determined. These measure-\nments were performed before and after each AVTIS image\nacquisition so that the pointing coordinates could be aver-\naged over each site occupation. Analysis shows that the\nrelative accuracy of angular referencing within each occu-\npation is about 0.01\u0001, confirming the stability of the\nplatform, and the reproducibility of the pan and tilt gimbal.\nHowever, between repeat occupations of the same site,\nresetting of the tripod results in reduced repeatability and\nsmall systematic offsets in the extracted surfaces. These\noffsets were removed by refining the calculated instrument\norientations in order to minimize the differences between\nsurfaces retrieved from stable terrain. Here, we used the\nouter, north-facing slopes of the volcano below the crater\nrim (an area of 0.1 km2 and slope of about 25\u0001, at a range of\nabout 5 to 5.5 km) and, after pointing refinement, the results\nshow elevation standard deviations of about \u00b13 m, when\nadjusted to their optimum fits.\n[14] The reflector measurements also provided range\nbenchmarks from which any drift in the radar range mea-\nsurement could be assessed and corrected. The slope of the\nradar frequency sweep, which determines the received\nfrequency to range conversion, was found to vary slowly\nover the course of a site occupation, as the instrument\nchanged temperature. After initial warm-up, the range\naccuracy would typically drift by up to 0.05% over the\ncourse of a single scan\u2014i.e., a maximum drift of \u00013 m at\n6 km range. Over a complete site occupation of several\nhours, the range of drift could total as much as 0.5% (30 m\nat 6 km range). The GPS-measured reflector positions were\ntherefore used to calibrate the range drift based on the\napparent radar range at the start and end of each scan.\n[15] Consequently, individual AVTIS range measure-\nments during this campaign were subject to inaccuracies\narising from low signal strength, drift, local scattering\neffects and pointing uncertainties. The resultant noise in\nthe range data, which was dominated by the low SNR at\nlong ranges, was reduced by temporal stacking of range\nprofiles within each site occupation, giving a daily average\nfor the two sites, when occupied (Table 2). The resultant\noccupation-averaged range values were then combined with\nabsolute orientation data to provide 3D coordinates of\nsurface points that were then interpolated spatially onto a\n10-m grid (Montserrat local grid coordinates) by kriging.\nTemporal stacking in this way means that any topographic\nchanges during the period of the occupation will be aver-\naged, and the resulting surfaces are assumed to represent the\ndome surface at the midpoint of each occupation.\n2.2. Rockfall Seismicity\n[16] Montserrat Volcano Observatory (MVO) maintains a\nrecord of rockfall-induced seismic events consisting of the\ntime, duration, repose interval and energy release for each\nrecorded event, as derived from its broadband network of\nseismometers. However, a large number of smaller volume\nrockfalls impart too little energy to the ground to be\nrecorded as a network event, so only the largest magnitude\nrockfalls are recorded in the seismicity catalogue. The\nenergy (actually the energy density in J\u0003kg\u00041) measured\nfor each event varies with instrument and location and can\nbe used to locate the travel paths of flows [Jolly et al.,\n2002]. We have used mainly data from the MBGH seis-\nmometer, located about three kilometers west of the dome.\nFor part of 9 and 10 April we have also used the MBLY\nseismometer record, which was the only instrument operat-\ning during that interval. By calibrating MBLY against\nMBGH we have substituted the appropriately scaled MBLY\ndata for 9\/10 April into the MBGH record. We justify this\non the grounds of the similarity of the energy characteristics\nmeasured at MBLY over the two periods.\n[17] MVO distinguishes between rockfall (RF) and long-\nperiod rockfall (LPRF) events, with RF events characterized\nby high-frequency spectra (2\u20138 Hz) and LPRF events\nhaving an additional spectral peak in the 1- to 2-Hz range.\nThis long-period component originates from fluid resonance\nin the conduit and is sometimes associated with gas releas-\ning into the atmosphere, particularly when the extrusion rate\nis high [Luckett et al., 2002]. Calder et al. [2005] showed\nthat, for rockfall data for the 1995\u20131997 period, with\nincreased extrusion rate of lava (and particularly for higher\nrates), the duration of each seismic event increased and the\nrepose interval decreased.\n[18] It is possible to use the rockfall seismic event\ncatalogue to infer flow volumes by examining the correla-\ntion between seismic event duration and observed flow\nrunout distance (Figure 12a) and then converting distance\nto flow volume. To determine runout distance, several types\nof photographic information were used to estimate the\nrunout of rockfalls and pyroclastic flows as measured from\ntheir sources near the summit of the dome. These included\nhand-held, and tripod-mounted, still and video cameras at\nthe AVTIS measurement sites, and the MVO automated\ncamera at the Windy Hill site (Figure 1) that captured\nimages every minute and was available from 1 to 10 April.\nThe distal extent of the rockfalls and flows generally could\nnot be seen directly in these images, but their locations were\ninferred (to the nearest 100 m) from the image positions of\nthe turbulent buoyant ash plumes that the flows generated\nTable 2.

The flow runout\nvalues generated in this way are likely to be underestimates\nin some cases because the wind was almost always from the\neast during this period, moving in the opposite direction to\nthe majority of flows, and tended to blow the ash plumes\nwestward, back from the flow front, as they rose. The one-\nminute interval images were more susceptible to this effect,\nthe video data less so.\n[19] To convert runout lengths into deposit volumes,\ntypical values for the other deposit dimensions are required.\nField observations of flow deposits at Soufrie`re Hills that\nextend just beyond the talus typically show variations\nbetween thin (0.2 m thick), sheet-like (100 m wide) deposits\nto channelized\/lobate deposits (10\u201330 m wide; 0.5\u20132 m\nthick) [Cole et al., 2002; Figure 9a] giving cross-sectional\nareas in the range 5\u201360 m2. Calder et al. [2002] suggested\nvolumes up to 1000 m3 as typical for rockfalls with runouts\nup to 500 m. Using the above range of cross-sectional areas,\nthe volumes of deposits at 1 km runout would be 5,000\u2013\n60,000 m3. 10,000 m3 for 1 km runout deposits was\nsuggested by Calder et al. [2002]. For flows up to 2 km\nrunout, volumes of up to about 100,000 m3 have been\nestimated [Cole et al., 2002]. Consequently, each RF\/LPRF\nevent with a runout greater than 500 m (based on duration)\nis assigned a volume using a linear fit to the three runout-\nvolume values: 103 m3 at 500 m, 104 m3 at 1000 m and\nFigure 6.

We estimate the uncertainties on the\nresulting volumes to be in the range 50\u2013100% at a\nminimum.\n3. Results\n3.1. AVTIS\n3.1.1. Talus Volumes From Topographic Surface\nChanges\n[20] The JBH and Runway viewpoints image slightly\ndifferent areas of the dome. From Runway, more of the\nsoutheastern sector of the dome is seen but, being lower in\nelevation than JBH, more of the lowermost talus is obscured\nby the crater wall. The average area of the dome covered by\nAVTIS from both viewpoints is about 700,000 m2, with a\nspatial density of range points of about 1 per 100 m2. Due to\ninstrument repositioning between repeat site occupations,\nno two data sets represent precisely the same lines of sight,\nbut Figure 4 shows the maximum areas covered from the\ntwo viewpoints. Both compose about 50% lava surface in\nthe southwest and 50% talus in the northeast. Figure 4 also\nshows that a sector of about 180\u0001 was thought to be actively\ninvolved in mass wasting during this period (Figure 11).\n[21] Figures 5 and 6 show the surface differences for each\nsuccessive occupation for JBH (relative to 2 April 2006)\nand Runway (relative to 30 March 2006) sites, respectively,\nand Table 3 gives the net volumetric changes and areas of\noverlap used to calculate those changes. With two excep-\ntions, successive differences show net increases in volume.\nFrom Runway, the uppermost southeastern part of the dome\nshows a large negative area developing between 30 and\n31 March. Five days later on 5 April, the negative feature is\nreduced in magnitude and area and a large positive feature\nhas formed immediately to the east. In the succeeding two\ndays (6 and 7 April) this trend continues. We interpret the\nnegative feature to be the result of a large collapse event,\nremoving 40 m or more of dome lava from around the\nsummit and moving it out of the measurement area.\n[22] There were no equivalent measurements from JBH\non 30 and 31 March, and the coverage from JBH includes\nonly the northernmost parts of the two main features\nmeasured from Runway. A distinct negative feature can\nbe seen in the JBH data on the south central part of the\ndome (Figure 6). Like the Runway data, most of the new\ntalus volume is added to the lowermost eastern slopes.\nThere was a negligible change in measured talus volume\nbetween 8 and 9 April. As we shall see, this was a period of\nincreased pyroclastic flow activity and it may be that this\nlow net volume was because the rockfall transport was\nparticularly effective in moving it away from the upper talus\nslopes. The uncertainties on these estimates must be higher\nthan those for the outer crater differences (\u00b13 m), mainly\ndue to difficulties in the precise determination of the dome\n\u2018\u2018horizon\u2019\u2019 due to the radar beam width. They cannot be\nindependently quantified and an uncertainty level of \u00b15 m is\nused.\n[23] The average rate of height increase of the surface\n(Figures 5 and 6; Table 3) is about 2.0 m per day; 14 \u00b1 5 m\nover 7 days for JBH, and 17 \u00b1 5 m over 8 days for Runway.\nThe volumetric rate of addition for these two intervals is 1.4\nm3\u0003s\u00041 for JBH and 1.9 m3\u0003s\u00041 for Runway. However, a\nconsiderable portion of the talus and the volume that must\nhave accumulated there is hidden from both viewpoints.\nThe profiles through the Runway surfaces for 30 March and\n7 April (Figure 7) indicate these hidden accumulations.\n[24] The volume of the new talus hidden from AVTIS\nduring the measurement period (Figure 7) can be estimated\nTable 3.

AVTIS surface\ndifferencing accounted for the volumetric change over areas\nof about 0.07 km2 from both Runway and JBH sites\n(Table 3), about 17% of the total, active area. We now\nassume that the daily volumetric changes measured by\nAVTIS, averaged when there is near-contemporaneous\nRunway and JBH data (Table 3), can be extrapolated to\nthe whole of the area of active talus in proportion to the\nareas concerned (Table 5). The total talus volume thus\nproduced is 7.2 \u0002 106 m3. This may be an underestimate\nbecause much of the extrapolated area is at lower elevation\nand thus there are relatively fewer \u2018\u2018source\u2019\u2019 areas of mass\nloss from the upper part of the dome. The extrapolated\narea also has a generally lower gradient than the AVTIS-\nmeasured areas and so deposition should be more likely.\nOn the other hand, use of the observed areas may have\noverestimated the volume deposited in the south.\n[25] To compare the proportion of lava staying in the\ndome core to that deposited as talus or in pyroclastic flows,\nbulk volumes need to be converted to their dense rock\nequivalents (DRE). Sparks et al. [1998] used bulk densities\nof 2600, 2250 and 2000 kg\u0003m\u00043 for dense rock, vesicular\nlava and pyroclastic flow deposits at Soufrie`re Hills and\ncorresponding density ratios of 0.86 and 0.77 for converting\nbulk vesicular lava and pyroclastic flow deposit volumes to\nDRE. Density ratios for bulk clastic rocks fall in the\nrange 0.65\u20130.60 (mean 0.63) (e.g., www.simetic.co.uk\/si_\nmaterials.htm). An appropriate figure for the density ratio\nfor Soufriere Hills talus might be 0.54 (0.63 \u0002 0.86),\nthough this would be a minimum value because infilling\nwith fine ash is not taken into account. In the following\ncalculations we use the ratios of 0.86, 0.77 and 0.54 to\nnormalize the bulk volumes of core lava, pyroclastic flow\ndeposits and talus, respectively. Thus the DRE for the\ntotal talus volume is 3.9 \u0002 106 m3.\n3.1.2. Dome Core Lava Volumes From Intensity\nMeasurements\n[26] The strength (intensity) of the signal received by\nAVTIS is a function of the range distance, path attenuation,\nthe local scattering and dielectric properties of the surface\n(reflectivity), and the angle that the surface makes with the\nradar beam. Typically, the variability of the intensity across\nthe dome\u2019s surface is about 3\u20134 dB at a range of 6\u20137 km.\nMacfarlane et al. [2006] were able to distinguish the highly\nreflective, blocky, surfaces of new lava flows from less\nreflective ash-covered surfaces at a distance of about 3 km\nusing AVTIS intensity images of Arenal volcano. No similar\ndistinction is apparent at Soufrie`re Hills, where the talus and\nlava surfaces tend to exhibit similar intensities. Fortuitously\noriented, large (>10 m), blocks of lava often give stronger\nintensities than their surroundings, and the continuity of\nsome of these can be tracked in the time series over several\ndays. Anderson et al. [1998] proposed that the block size of\nsilicic lava flows in the range 0.2\u20135 m was inversely\ncorrelated with extrusion rate. Unfortunately, the footprint\nof the radar at the dome from JBH and Runway is too large\nto resolve local roughness (via a root mean square measure\nof intensity) at that length scale.\nFigure 8. AVTIS intensity images of the lava dome. Figure 8a shows the averages of intensity collected\nin occupations 2 (30 March) and 11 (6 April) from the Runway site. Figure 8b shows the averages of\nintensity collected in occupations 5 (2 April) and 17 (9 April) from the JBH site. Variations in cloud cover\nfrom occupation to occupation meant that the absolute reflectivity values for the surface could not be\ndetermined. The color scales therefore represent relative reflected power intensity scaled for each\nparticular occupation: a 7-dB range for the Runway images and a 5-dB range for the JBH images. The\npixels on the dome represent areas of about 10 \u0002 10 m.\nB08210 WADGE ET AL.: GROWTH OF A LAVA DOME AND TALUS\n9 of 15\nB08210\n[27] While the intensity data cannot be employed statis-\ntically, we can use them to quantify the volume of lava at\nthe top of the dome. The skyline of the dome viewed by\nAVTIS from JBH or Runway has a diminishing intensity as\nincreasing amounts of \u2018\u2018sky\u2019\u2019 dilute the return signal from\nthe dome. Nevertheless, the AVTIS-derived intensity sky-\nline yields useful information about the elevation profile of\nthe summit of the dome and from that the component of\nthe lava output that remains as part of the dome core.\nFigure 8 shows a pair of intensity images from both\nmeasurement sites. Over the eight-day and seven-day inter-\nvals separating the images in the two pairs, major changes\nhave occurred. The elevation of the more easterly of the two\npeaks has grown and the gradient of the more southeasterly\nprofile (to the left of each image) has reduced slightly with\ntime. From such images, the equivalent elevations of the\nsurfaces derived from the range data and from photographs,\nwe have estimated the changing summit profiles with time.\nThe highest parts of the dome measured by AVTIS from the\ndaily surfaces are shown in Table 4 to the nearest 10 m.\nBetween 5 and 6 April the dome increased its maximum\nelevation from between 910 and 920 m asl to between 940\nand 950 m asl. There seems to have been no further increase\nmeasured after that up to 9 April. On 18 May 2006 the\nelevation of the dome summit was surveyed by total station\nas 1006 m asl.\n[28] From the daily average intensity images of the dome\n(four examples are shown in Figure 8) and the range data,\nmeasurements of the areal increments of lava added to the\nsummit (Figure 7) along the AVTIS LOS have been made\nfor each occupation (Table 4). Note that we cannot use the\nrange-derived surface differencing method here because,\ngenerally, the summit data do not overlap in the LOS\n(Figure 7). Lack of observations of the western side of\nthe dome summit prevents an accurate measurement of the\nwhole summit area. Nevertheless, we can estimate the\nincremental volumes of lava added and lost to the summit\nby assuming that each observed profile is representative of a\n200-m diameter cap of lava. These estimates are shown in\nTable 4. Uncertainties of about 30\u201350% are considered\nlikely. Given that most of the lava extrusion was directed\ntoward the eastern side of the summit, this assumed radial\nsymmetry means that the volumes may be over-estimated.\nThe volume of lava remaining at the summit increased\ngenerally in a similar way in both data sets, though at a\nfaster rate later in the measurement period. The exception is\nthe interval between 2 and 3 April for the JBH record, when\na net reduction in height was recorded. This implies a\nsignificant collapse volume for this interval. Table 4 shows\nthat both data sets record a notable increase in lava added\nbetween 5 and 6 April. Averaging the two data sets gives a\ntotal addition to the summit of about 1.7 \u0002 106 m3 (1.5 \u0002\n106 m3 DRE) of lava over the eleven-day interval from\n30 March to 9 April.\n3.2. Pyroclastic Flow Deposit Volumes From Rockfall\nSeismicity\n[29] The number of recorded RF and LPRF events during\nthe AVTIS campaign increased at the start of the measure-\nment period from a lower level, dipped on 5\/6 April, and\npeaked on 8 April (Figure 9) with their proportions remain-\ning nearly constant. However, the seismic energy released\nvaried greatly (Figure 10), with several large magnitude\nevents occurring on 31 March, and the largest single energy\nTable 4.

Some of these events\nwere observed to correspond to the generation of pyroclastic\nflows but the period 5\u20137 April was notable for a lack of\nlarger magnitude events. The longest runout pyroclastic\nflow that was observed visually reached 1800 m from the\ndome summit at about 14:30 UTC on 2 April.\n[30] Almost all the 70 visually observed events could be\ncorrelated with the equivalent seismic record, which\ncontained a total of 1053 RF and LPRF events. The\ndisparity between these two figures is largely accounted\nfor by lack of visual observations during the night and\nduring periods when cloud covered the volcano. Pyroclastic\nflows could sometimes be observed emerging below the\ncloud base, whereas rockfall events at that time would be\nunobserved visually. Using the rockfall seismicity duration\ndata (Figure 12) allowed the total volume of pyroclastic\nflows for the 30 March to 9 April period to be estimated as\n1.8 \u0002 106 m3 (1.4 \u0002 106 m3 DRE).\n3.3. Temporal Variability\n[31] Combining the DRE estimate of pyroclastic flow\ndeposit volume (1.4 \u0002 106 m3) with the estimates for the\ntalus volume (3.9\u0002 106 m3) and summit lava (1.5\u0002 106 m3)\ngives a total of 6.8 \u0002 106 m3 for the eleven-day period\n(Table 5). Figure 13 shows the cumulative daily totals for\nthe talus, talus-plus-summit-lava and all three sources\ntogether. Up to 5 April the output is nearly linear. Note\nthat the net loss of lava from the summit between 2 and\n3 April (Table 4) moves the talus-plus-summit-lava curve\nbelow the talus curve until 5 April. After 5 April the\ncontribution from the summit lava increases and the overall\noutput rate increases. The equivalent daily seismic energy\nrelease shows a different pattern (Figure 13), with a gradual\nreduction from 31 March to 6 April, followed by a much\nhigher rate. Both data sets show the same contrast between\nmodest rates in the first part of the record and the much\nmore vigorous second period. The main difference is that\nthe volumetric estimates show a rise on 5 April, while the\ninflection in the cumulative rockfall seismic energy occurs\non 7 April. Our interpretation of this is that the lava supply\nrate increased on 5 April. This had the effect of building up\na new mass of lava at the summit, as observed by AVTIS.\nRockfalls that occurred were smaller than usual and fewer\nwere recorded as events from the seismometer network. For\n5 and 6 April the rockfall seismicity was not a good proxy\nfor the high lava extrusion rate, but from 7 April onward the\nsize and number of rockfall events increased greatly as\nthe high rate of extrusion was maintained. It is possible that\nthis lag in behavior was due to the reorientation of the\nextrusive vent.\n4. Discussion\n[32] The summit of the lava dome was either in cloud or\ndarkness for about 90% of the campaign. Nevertheless,\nopportunistic photographs taken from the AVTIS measure-\nment sites confirm that the lava dome changed its shape and\nsize during the AVTIS observation period. The summit of\nthe dome increased its elevation, at least one large dome\nblock collapsed and the surface of talus increased its\nelevation. This talus growth occurred on the eastern side\nof the dome. Photographs from the Perches site (Figure 11)\non 23 March and 10 April show this clearly. Over that\neighteen-day period, the talus increased its extent to the\nsoutheast, burying an area of fumarolic activity. When this\nlateral spreading of talus occurred is not certain, the\nincreased rate of rockfall and the large collapse events on\n31 March make this a likely contender for the start of this\nchange. A rise in the general elevation of the talus can be\nseen in Figure 11, particularly along the retaining wall on\nthe northeastern side of the crater.\n[33] Photogrammetric surveys of the dome from the east\nwere undertaken by MVO, using sites at Perches and\nGalway\u2019s Mountain (on the crater rim to the west southwest\nof Perches) on 23 March (Figure 11) and 26 April. These\nyielded dome volumes of 56 \u0002 106 m3 and 78 \u0002 106 m3,\nrespectively (\u00b120%). These estimates include the talus\ncomponent of the dome, which is more visible from these\ntwo sites than from JBH and Runway (Figures 4 and 11),\nbut not the pyroclastic flow deposits further down the\nvalley. The ratio of core lava to talus was not estimated\nin these surveys. If we assume the same ratio as for the\nAVTIS survey, this gives an average DRE extrusion rate of\n4.9 m3\u0003s\u00041.\n[34] From the AVTIS measurements and the surface\ndifferences generated (Figures 5 and 6) it is clear that\nbetween 30 March and 9 April: (i) the summit of the dome\nrose, (ii) some large masses of the dome lava collapsed, and\n(iii) the lower talus slopes generally rose by deposition.\nWhile there is evidence of talus deposition around most of\nthe observed slopes from the north to the southeast, the\nTable 5.

This agrees with the\nphotographic observation above.\n[35] The proportion of extruding lava that remained\nwithin the lava core of the dome from 30 March to 9 April\n2006 was about 22%. How certain is this result in the\ncontext of the measurement uncertainties? We measured the\nuncertainty of surface retrieval near the dome as \u00b13 m,\nwhich we relaxed to \u00b15 m for the dome itself. Over the\neleven days of measurement this represented \u00b125% of the\nmeasured change. The estimates of core lava are based on\nAVTIS range values near the skyline of the dome which are\nknown to be noisy, and we suggested an uncertainty range\nof \u00b130\u201350%. Pyroclastic flow deposit volumes are less well\nconstrained because the rockfall seismicity is a crudely\ncalibrated proxy for volume, and we assigned a \u00b150\u2013\n100% uncertainty range. If we take uncertainties of \u00b125,\n40 and 75% to be representative of talus, core lava and\npyroclastic flow deposit volumes, respectively, then the\nproportion of the core to the total has a mean and uncer-\ntainty bounds of 22 (11\u201339) %. The equivalent bounds for\ntalus are 57 (39\u201380) % and 21 (5\u201339) % for the pyroclastic\nflow deposits. Even at the most favorable limit of uncer-\nFigure 11.

The solid line in Figure 12a represents a\nvelocity of 8 m\u0003s\u00041, and the dashed lines (4 and 15 m\u0003s\u00041)\nindicate the limits of video-based estimates of pyroclastic\nflow velocities beyond the talus. Note that rockfalls\nobserved to remain within the limit of the talus (\u0001500 m)\nhave all been assigned an average runout of 300 m.\nB08210 WADGE ET AL.: GROWTH OF A LAVA DOME AND TALUS\n13 of 15\nB08210\ntainty, the lava retained within the core was only slightly\nmore than one third of the total (\u000139%) and thus the\nprimary finding of this work, that a surprisingly low\nproportion of extruded lava remained in the core of the\ndome, is valid, despite the uncertainties. The occurrence of\none or two larger collapses and pyroclastic flows, of which\nthere were none in this interval, would change this figure\nsignificantly. Nevertheless, we regard the relative fractions\ninvolved in mass wasting as being broadly representative of\nthe behavior between these larger collapse events.\n[36] This third episode of dome growth (which began in\nAugust 2005) was less prone to larger collapse events than\nduring the earlier two episodes of extrusion. For example,\nduring the first half of 1997, when the lava extrusion rate\nwas less than 5 m3\u0003s\u00041 the dome:pyroclastic flow volume\nratio was about 60:40, but this became about 40:60 when\nthe extrusion rate rose to about 10 m3\u0003s\u00041 during the second\nhalf of 1997 [Sparks et al., 1998]. This contrasts strongly\nwith the 79:21 ratio measured here during similar extrusion\nrates. The average DRE extrusion rate over the eleven\ndays was \u00017 m3\u0003s\u00041, and for the nonpyroclastic flow\ncomponents a rate of \u00015 m3\u0003s\u00041, compared to the equiva-\nlent \u00015 m3\u0003s\u00041 measured by photogrammetry for the\n23 March\u201326 April period.\n[37] The high proportion of extruded lava that is con-\nverted to talus revealed by this study has implications for\nhazard analysis. Lava that remains in the core of the dome\ncan retain much more heat and gas content and sustain\ngreater overpressures than the surrounding apron of lava\ntalus. The sudden depressurization of this lava can lead to\nthe generation of large, mobile pyroclastic flows and even\nlateral blasts [e.g., Woods et al., 2002]. Thus, if the high\ndegree of conversion of lava to talus measured in this study\nis representative in the longer term, then the total volume of\nhighly pressurized core lava will be less. This may reduce\nthe propensity for hazardous pyroclastic flows derived from\na large collapse involving a high proportion of the dome.\nAlso, the implication of being able to measure, via AVTIS\ndata, the volume of lava added to the core over periods of\ndays to weeks is that any variable propensity for hazardous\nflows could be evaluated in near-real time. As Calder et al.\n[2002] showed, it is during rapid growth of shear lobes,\nparticularly those involving a change in extrusion direction,\nthat collapses are likely to occur over times scales of\nperhaps a few days. High-frequency measurements by\nAVTIS would be required to detect this and provide some\nearly warning.\n[38] Throughout, we have assumed that the dome growth\nprocess measured by AVTIS was entirely exogenous. That\nis, all the rising magma reached the surface near the summit\nof the dome and none was added internally to swell the\ndome or displace the talus [Hale, 2008]. There is no reason\nto doubt this, but AVTIS range change alone is not enough\nto distinguish between surface deposition and swelling. The\nuppermost slopes of the dome that expose the core lava and\nhave the highest gradients (>40\u0001), tend not to accumulate\nnew mass and occasionally shed large volumes. Our data\nwere not sufficient to determine whether any differential\nvolume accumulation on different slopes was occurring.\nDuring the measurement period there were several depar-\ntures from the steady state, incremental view of the mass\nwasting process at the dome as a series of rockfalls\n(individually unmeasurable by AVTIS), continually trans-\nporting mass from the dome summit to the talus. A major\nloss of mass from the upper eastern part of the dome appears\nto have occurred on 31 March, during one of the large\nrockfall events. Downslope from this, mass was accumu-\nlating as early as 2 April, particularly after 5 April, and both\nthe Runway and JBH records show deposition increasing to\nthe southeast. A 40-m increase in the elevation of the dome\nsummit appears to occur primarily between 5 and 6 April at\nthe time of a minimum in the number and energy of RF\/\nFigure 13. Cumulative daily volumes of talus (thin solid line), talus and summit lava (medium solid\nline), and talus, summit lava, and pyroclastic flow deposits (thick solid line).

This could represent a minor change in the\nvent extrusion direction as new mass accumulated at the\nsummit. However, despite the reduction in rockfall numbers,\nthe rate of addition to the AVTIS-measurable talus area did\nnot slacken. This may be because these lower energy rock-\nfalls deposited their mass more proximally than at other\ntimes.\n[39] There is no doubt that AVTIS could yield much more\nvaluable information on the dome growth process with\nimproved temporal and spatial resolution. Rockfalls with\ntypical volumes in the range 103\u2013104 m3 occurred about\nevery 15 minutes during our observations. From a closer\nviewpoint, with improved SNR and faster scan speed it\nshould be feasible to detect the sources and deposits of\nindividual rockfalls. This would enable us, by combining\nthis information with rockfall seismology, to explore the\ndynamics of the process more fully and to greatly reduce the\nuncertainties of volume estimation. A continuous audit of\nthe dome core versus talus volumes would also help to\nevaluate the hazard posed by future large pyroclastic flows\ninvolving core lava.\n[40] Acknowledgments.
