Cystoscopy with biopsy is the \u2018\u2018gold\nstandard\u2019\u2019 for bladder cancer detection, but it is expensive,\ninconvenient and invasive. Urine cytology is a more acceptable\nalternative, and the most widely applied of the non-invasive\nprocedures available. Although urine cytology has a high speci-\nficity for bladder cancer (90\u201398%), its sensitivity is low (20\u201350%),\nespecially for low-grade tumours, since those shed proportionally\nfew cells into the urine. Furthermore, the results take several\ndays, requiring an expert to interpret the test.1\nUtilisation of molecular biomarkers for bladder cancer is\na tantalising prospect for making diagnosis more sensitive, rapid\nand convenient, provided such biomarkers can be discovered in\nurine and readily identified in a clinical setting. Two FDA\napproved protein markers, nuclear matrix protein 22 (NMP22)\nand bladder tumour antigen (BTAstat), have proven effective in\nthis context.2,3 They are more sensitive than urine cytology,\nhaving achieved reported sensitivities of 50\u201385% and 50\u201370%,\nrespectively. However, their specificities, in the region of 60\u201370%,\nare inferior to that of urine cytology.\nRecently, it has been suggested that volatile organic\ncompounds (VOCs) present in the headspace of urine samples\nmay be used as cancer biomarkers.4,5 In particular, a previousaCranfield University, College Road, Cranfield, Bedfordshire, MK43 0AL,\nUK.

The results of this\nproof of principle study suggested that one or more VOCs\npresent within the urine headspace are indicative of bladder\ncancer and have the potential to be used as diagnostic\nbiomarkers. As it is not realistic to use dogs in a clinical setting,\nwe substituted the dogs with a more practical and objective gas\nsensor array, also called an electronic nose (eNose). Developed to\nmimic olfaction, these instruments have shown promise in lung\ncancer detection.7Methods\nParticipant selection\nA total of 30 patients, aged 50\u201388, presenting at Buck-\ninghamshire Hospitals NHS Trust with new or recurrent\ntransitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder supplied urine\nprior to surgical intervention. Grade and stage of the tumour\nwere recorded. Fifty nine control subjects, categorised into one\nof three groups (Controls 1, 2 and 3, depending upon age and\ndisease status), also provided urine samples. Twenty healthy\nindividuals aged 18\u201331, with no urine abnormality on dipstick\nmade up Control group 1 (C1). Control group 2 (C2) consisted\nof 20 subjects between 18 and 32, with any non-cancerous\ncondition or disease, and\/or one or more positive dipstick\nfinding. Menstruating women with blood in their urine were\nincluded in this group, for example, as were individuals with\nsuspected urinary tract infection, positive for leucocytes, blood\nand\/or protein. Categorized into the Control 3 group (C3) were\n19 patients, aged between 24 and 89, with confirmed non-\ncancerous urological disease, with or without urine dipstick\nabnormalities. Urological conditions included renal and\nureteric stones, renal cysts and polypoid cystitis.

For both controls and the cancer\npositive group (TCC), men over 50 years were only included if\nrecent cancer-negative prostate histology had been demon-\nstrated. Individuals with pre-malignant urological disease or\na history of urological carcinoma other than TCC were excluded.\nA history of malignancy in other organ systems (>5 years\npreviously) was acceptable, providing the individual was now\nconsidered disease-free. All other past and\/or present medical\nconditions were permissible. There were no exclusions on the\nbasis of medication, menstrual cycle, diet, alcohol consumption,\nor chemical exposure. However, details of all of these factors\nwere recorded for each participant, should their influence on the\ncomposition and odour of the urine need to be considered at any\nstage. Special attention was paid to smoking habits, with one\nthird of those with bladder cancer being current cigarette\nsmokers, as compared to 17 out of 59 control subjects. A\nspreadsheet containing all this information is provided as ESI\u2020.\nThe study was approved by the Mid and South Buck-\ninghamshire Local Research Ethics Committee, and all partici-\npants gave written informed consent.Analysis and processing of urine samples\nFollowing urinalysis (Multistix 10 SG, Bayer Corporation, NY,\nUSA), fresh urine specimens were refrigerated immediately, and\nfrozen 1\u201324 h later as 0.5 ml aliquots in glass vials. They were\nthen stored at \u000280 \u0003C until required.Headspace analysis\nAn electronic nose was used to characterise the VOC (volatile\norganic compound) content of urine. Measurements were per-\nformed using an NST 3320 Lab Emission Analyser.8 The\ninstrument comprises 12 metal oxide semi-conductor (MOS)\nsensors and an array of 10 individual metal oxide semi-conductor\nfield-effect transistor (MOSFET) sensors, together with\na capacitance-based humidity sensor and an infrared-based CO2\nsensor.\nThe 89 urine samples were randomised, removed from storage\nat \u000280 \u0003C and allowed to thaw at room temperature (approxi-\nmately 21 \u0003C). The thawed samples were then aliquoted into two\nheadspace vials, each containing 2.5 ml of urine, providing\nduplicate samples. The samples were then incubated for 1 hour at\n38 \u0003C before they were analysed in batches of 12 samples using\nthe eNose. Signals from each of the 24 sensors are generated by\ntheir response to the different chemical characteristics of the\nurine headspace. The analysis was performed in cycles, exposing\nthe sensors to fresh reference air between the measurements. A\ncycle was composed of Baseline, Sample and Recovery. During\nruntime, all sensor signals were collected in periodic time inter-\nvals of one second. From these resulting raw data, eight char-\nacteristic signal parameters were estimated by the eNose software\nas baseline, response, absolute response, on derivative, on integral,\noff derivative, off integral and difference. This can be seen as data\nreduction, very likely resulting in a speed up of subsequent\npattern recognition analysis. Fig. 1 shows the sensor parameters\ngraphically.

This procedure resembles a filter\nmethod that automatically picks out variables within the data\nthat are most distinctive of each class, or from another point of\nview deselects those variables that are not significant at all. For\nthis purpose, univariate statistics\u2014a t-test\u2014was applied. The\nt-test is more or less a decision rule to determine if two samples\nbelong to the same population, according to a specified signifi-\ncance level a.13 Dependent on the significance level a, two vari-\nables, in this case, non-cancerous and cancerous samples, were\neither considered as similar or different. For data analysis, the\nsignificance level a was initially set to 0.05 and varied from 0.1 to\n0.9 in steps of 0.1. Features whose probability value did not rise\nabove the threshold a were taken as being different and were\ntherefore regarded as relevant for disease-related discrimination.\nFrom a statistical point of view high a-values are not suitable to\nselect significant features, but can be used to deselect insignificant\nvariables as noise for example.\nNext, partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA)14\nwas used to build a classification model using the cancer status of\nthe samples. PLS-DA is a supervised method. This calls for\ninformation about the parameter of interest (the cancer status) to\nbe known in order to train the algorithm to identify which\nsensors capture the molecules that differentiate between the\nclasses. PLS-DA is considered to be a dimensionality reduction\nmethod and can be seen as the regression extension of principal\ncomponent analysis.15 Unlike PCA, which attempts to describe\nthe maximum variation in the measured data, PLS-DA tends to\nmaximise the covariance between the input data and the output\nclass. The information returned by PCA is that which was caused\nby the attribute with the biggest variance. In contrast, PLS-DA\nreturns only data that were caused by the property under\ninvestigation.\nIt is known that PLS-DA is prone to overestimate the accuracy\nof classification if it is not accurately validated.16 For this reason,\na very thorough evaluation process, leave-one-out cross-valida-\ntion (LOOCV),17 was implemented to assess the performance of\nthe PLS-DA-classifier. This method is based on the concept of\nclassifying one sample against a model, built using the rest of the\nsamples. This procedure is repeated with each sample until all\nsamples have been classified. Information about the true positive\nrate and the true negative rate was established.\nAs final validation of the results, and to attain an indication of\nthe significance of the results, a Monte Carlo Simulation was\nused to evaluate the obtained results.18 This involves repeated\nrandom sampling. In this context a null model is generated from\na set of data that is statistically similar to the data under study,\nbut for which we do not expect to be able to build a meaningful\nclassification model. A total of 250 datasets of this kind were\ngenerated, by simply assigning a random class to each sample\n(while maintaining the relative number of positive and negative\nsamples). For a disease discriminating model trained on the real\nsample classes to be considered significant it needs to achieve\na classification accuracy towards the extremities of those\nproduced by the null models.Fig. 2 The PCA scores plot does not appear to show any discrimination\nbetween cancerous ( ) and control samples of group C1 (B). The data\nwere pre-treated using range-scaling between 0 and 1.Results and discussion\nThe 24 sensors of the electronic nose instrument initially recor-\nded 192 sensor variables. However, during a later stage of theThis journal is \u00aa The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011eNose analysis, significant random noise was identified in five of\nthe MOSFET sensors. As a consequence, the information\nprovided by these sensors was omitted from the data analysis.\nHence, 152 sensor variables (8 sensor variables \u0004 19 remaining\nsensors) remained. To assess the role of the classification of each\nsensor technology, we used the full array for classification as well\nas only the MOS and only the MOSFET sensors to calculate\ndifferent classification models.\nAs already mentioned in the Methods section, the 59 speci-\nmens belonging to the cancer-negative control group were sub-\ndivided into further subgroups (C1\u2013C3). For this reason, we\nsectioned our work into four main experiments. Firstly, each of\nthe three control subgroups was classified separately against the\ncancer group and, finally, all control subgroups were combined\nand classified together against the TCCs.\nIn each of the four experiments, we used the full sensor array\nas well as the MOS sensors only and the MOSFET sensors only.\nFurthermore we applied the same pre-processing methods to the\ndata, including scaling and feature selection. Four different\nscaling methods and no scaling were evaluated, with range-\nscaling between 0 and 1 being found to be the best; therefore,\nonly these results are shown in this paper. Given that we were\nlooking for a pattern within the data and were therefore inter-\nested in relative quantities, not absolute quantities, it is not\nsurprising that range-scaling was most appropriate.\nExplorative data analysis, by way of PCA, was also applied in\neach experiment to reveal natural groupings based on the sensor\nresponses of the electronic nose. The PCA scores plot derived\nfrom the experimental data is shown in Fig. 2. However, the\nvisual output of this method did not disclose any relation to the\ncancer status of the samples, even though the principal compo-\nnents shown capture over 98% of the variance in the data. Other\ninfluences such as age, diet or gender may be responsible for the\ngroupings obtained. However, this does not mean that the data\ndo not contain any information concerning bladder cancer. The\nPCA only demonstrated that the cancer status is not responsible\nfor the bigger part of the variance, captured by the first two or\nthree principal components (PCs).

PLS-DA aims to\nmaximise the co-variation between the measured data and the\nclassification (non-cancerous vs. cancerous). This leads to the\ncapability to discriminate between samples that could not be\nseparated by PCA.\nWe started by training the PLS-DA-classifier with the two\nmost disparate groups: Control 1 (C1), representing healthy\nmales or females, and the TCC group incorporating people\nsuffering from bladder cancer. Since group C1 possesses the most\ndifferences compared to the cancer group, we expected the\nclassification outcome of this sample set to be the best, which\nproved to be correct. The best result obtained an overall total\naccuracy of 70% by range-scaling the data and configuring the\nsignificance level a \u00bc 0.8 for feature selection. A summary of the\nbest classification results of C1 vs. TCC is given in Table 1a).\nNext, we trained the classifier with Control 2 (C2) and the\ncancer group (TCC) data. Urine samples within this control\nsubgroup showed similar abnormalities on dipstick analysis to\nsome cancer samples, such as blood, for example, and were\ntherefore more difficult to distinguish from cancerous samples\nthan Control 1 (C1) samples. Both specificity and the total\naccuracy, achieved with the full sensor array, reflect this. Only\nthe sensitivity is marginally higher than that obtained for C1 vs.\nTCC in full sensor array mode. An overview of the results\nobtained is given in Table 1b).\nIn the third experiment, the classifier had to distinguish\nbetween samples with confirmed non-cancerous urological\ndiseases (Control 3) and cancerous samples (TCC).

A detailed overview of\nthese results is presented in Table 1c).\nFinally, in the fourth experiment, all three control sub-\ngroups (C1, C2, and C3) were merged to form one control\ngroup that was used as a counterpart to the TCC samples when\ntraining the binary classifier. The results of this experiment can\nbe seen in Table 1d). As expected, the total accuracy, obtained\nwith the entire sensor array, was not as high as in experiments\n1 and 2, where only samples from young people with no\nurological disease (C1, C2) were included. The major contrib-\nutor to this more moderate classification outcome was the\ninclusion of the samples from Control group 3. All subjects\nwithin this subgroup had confirmed non-cancerous urological\ndisease, the pathological effects of which are likely to be similar\nto the secondary effects of bladder cancer. Within both these\ngroups, varying amounts of metabolic products associated with\ninflammation, infection and\/or necrosis will almost certainly be\npresent.This journal is \u00aa The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011Because of this, Control 3 samples from the most important\ncontrol subset contain the most relevant information. Training\nthe classifier with this kind of data is therefore fundamental in\norder to be able to subtract general disease compounds present in\nthe urine from those specific for bladder cancer. Accurate diag-\nnosis of the control subjects is, of course, paramount to this\nprocess, since the inclusion of false negative individuals would\nlead to incorrect classification rules.\nInterestingly, within the TCC sample group, the majority of\nthose incorrectly classified as negative were from patients with\nmore advanced tumours. In these cases, it is possible that\nmetabolic products generated secondarily to the tumour may\noverwhelm or mask the volatile cancer biomarkers within the\nurine, giving rise to a urine headspace more closely resembling\nthat of Control 3 samples. Canine olfactory studies support this\nhypothesis; high grade TCCs with a significant level of invasion\nare missed more frequently by trained dogs than low-grade\nsuperficial tumours.19\nTo assess the significance of the presented results we carried\nout Monte Carlo Simulations.

Thus, the first experiment that included totally\nhealthy volunteers and cancer patients and produced a total\naccuracy of 70% is very significant (Fig. 3(a)). The result of the\nsecond experiment, comprising samples showing abnormalities\nat the dipstick analysis, can also be regarded as significant, with\nan overall accuracy of 67% (Fig. 3(b)). The third experiment\nincluded samples with confirmed non-cancerous urological\ndiseases and was therefore the most difficult to build classifiers\nfor. Not only did this experiment derive the lowest total\naccuracy (62%), the accuracy was found to be just below 62.5%\nthat marks the 95% confidence limit in the null model results\n(Fig. 3(c)). The fourth experiment made use of all available\ndata and attained a statistically significant classification result\nof 65%, which comfortably exceeds the 95% confidence limit\n(Fig. 3(d)).Conclusions\nBy combining a commercially available gas sensor array with\nchemometrics techniques, we have made progress towards a new\ninstrumental method of bladder cancer detection based on\nvolatile biomarkers. As many as 70% of cancer patients and 70%\nof non-cancerous subjects were correctly classified when the\nclassifier was trained with a combination of TCC positive urine\nsamples and samples from healthy participants with no urine\nabnormality. PLS-DA-derived models gave an accuracy for\npatients presenting with other non-cancerous urological disease\nof 65%, with 60% sensitivity and 67% specificity. There is little\ndifference between the performance of the two sensor types used\nin the array, but the results of the full array are consistently better\nthan the individual sets of sensors.\nAlthough the specificity achieved using this method was less\nthan that of conventional urine cytology, sensitivity was\nappreciably higher.1 This leads us to conclude that there is an\nanomalous composition to the VOC content of urine of\npatients suffering from bladder cancer, confirming previous\ncanine olfactory data.6 However, the gas sensor array may not\nbe the ideal analytical technique to detect this abnormal\ncomposition of urine headspace. We therefore recommend\na more revealing analytical technique such as mass spec-\ntrometry. More sophisticated pattern recognition techniques as\nsupport vector machines (SVMs)20 or artificial neural networks\n(ANNs)21 may also further advance the results obtained so\nfar.364 | Analyst, 2011, 136, 359\u2013364Acknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank the Amerderm Research Trust\nfor generous financial support.
