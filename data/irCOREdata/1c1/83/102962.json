There is growing interest in the attachment of proteins to solid supports for the development of supported\ncatalysts, affinity matrices, and micro devices as well as for the development of planar and bead based protein arrays for\nmultiplexed assays of protein concentration, interactions, and activity. A critical requirement for these applications is the\ngeneration of a stable linkage between the solid support and the immobilized, but still functional, protein.Methodology. Solid\nsupports including crosslinked polymer beads, beaded agarose, and planar glass surfaces, were modified to present an\noligoglycine motif to solution. A range of proteins were ligated to the various surfaces using the Sortase A enzyme of S. aureus.\nReactions were carried out in aqueous buffer conditions at room temperature for times between one and twelve hours.\nConclusions. The Sortase A transpeptidase of S. aureus provides a general, robust, and gentle approach to the selective\ncovalent immobilization of proteins on three very different solid supports.

PLoS ONE 2(11): e1164. doi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0001164\nINTRODUCTION\nA wide range of protein-based technological applications require\na linkage to be formed between a protein and a solid support. Solid\nsupported enzymes offer a means of recovering and re-using costly\nprotein catalysts. A range of modern assay approaches require the\nattachment of specific proteins to specific encoded beads [1,2] or\nmicroparticles [3]. The development of microfluidic analytical\ndevices is based in a number of cases on a probe protein attached\nto surfaces within the microdevice [4] or to beads placed within\na device [5]. Finally the development of planar protein arrays\nrequires that each protein is immobilised within a defined area on\nthe array surface.\nA range of immobilisation approaches are available including\nsimple absorption, trapping the protein within a gel matrix, or\ncovalent linkage. Absorption is often used in microplate immu-\nnoassays as a simple method for immobilisation that provides\nsufficient active antibody for the assays. However absorption poses\ntwo risks: that the protein may denature on the surface or that it\nmay wash off under assay or storage conditions. Trapping proteins\nwithin a gel matrix has been applied to the generation of protein\narrays with significant success. This provides a gentle immobilisa-\ntion approach that usually maintains protein activity.\nThe most robust approach to protein immobilisation is through\na covalent linkage. Non-specific covalent linkage through side-\nchain amino groups to activated surface functional groups [6]\nworks well for robust proteins with relaxed orientation require-\nments such as antibodies but in situations where surface\nhomogeneity and orientation is important these methods may\nnot be appropriate [7]. Site specific reaction of existing or\nengineered cysteine residues with activated or gold surfaces can\nprovide selective and oriented attachment [8,9] but are limited to\nsituations where cysteine residues can be optimally positioned\nand\/or removed from the native protein sequence.\nIn recent years a number of selective ligation chemistries have\nbeen developed that can be applied to biological systems. Both\nStaudinger ligation and \u2018Click\u2019 chemistry generate covalent\nlinkages from highly selective reactions of functional groups that\nare generally not found in biological systems. In both cases the\nincorporation of an azide into the protein to be modified is\nrequired. This can be achieved through misincorporation of azido\nfunctionalised amino acids in auxotrophic strains [10], through\nchemical modification of functional groups in amino acids within\nthe native or modified protein sequence [11,12], or through the\nselective modification of protein prosthetic groups [13]. The first\ntwo approaches for azide incorporation will in general be non-\nspecific and providing a single point of attachment will require\nfurther manipulation of the protein sequence in many cases.\nModification of prosthetic groups [13] will be convenient in some\ninstances but will be limited to particular cases.\nImmobilization via expressed protein ligation has been\nsuccessfully applied to a number of systems both directly [14,15]\nand via the addition of affinity reagents biotin [16] or specific\nfunctional groups including azides [17,18]. The use of intein-based\nsystems provides a site-selective method but is often limited due to\ndifficulties with expression of large target-intein fusion proteins\nand side reactions of the thiol based chemistry. In addition many\nof these modification approaches require multiple manipulations\nsteps, cloning and modification of the protein encoding gene,\nexpression and incorporation of the affinity label or functional\nAcademic Editor: Sotirios Koutsopoulos, Massachusetts Institute of Technology,\nUnited States of America\nReceived August 21, 2007; Accepted October 22, 2007; Published November 14,\n2007\nCopyright: \u0001 2007 Chan et al.

In addition the\nuse of intein based methods as well as the preparation of the solid\nsupport for Staudinger ligation often require reagents such as\nphosphines or thiophenols that are toxic and difficult to handle.\nTherefore there remains a significant need for robust and simple\nmethodologies for protein immobilization that can be applied to\nwide range of proteins and solid supports. The identification of the\nSortase transpeptidase [19] provided an alternative approach to\nprotein ligation. Sortases recognise a specific peptide sequence\n(LPETG for SrtA of S. aureus used in this work) in proteins targeted\nfor covalent attachment to the cell wall peptidoglycan. The peptide\ntag sequence is cleaved and then ligated to the pentaglycine moiety\non the peptidoglycan precursor Lipid II. Proteins expressed with the\nC-terminal recognition sequence can be covalently attached to a wide\nrange of constructs with an N-terminal glycine amidemotif including\npeptides [20], PNA [21], full length proteins [22] and small molecule\nsubstrates [23]. Another group has independently described an\nexample of Sortase mediated ligation to a beaded solid support [22].\nThese reactions proceed under aqueous conditions without the\naddition of any further reagents beyond the protein, ligation\nsubstrate, and Sortase. Thus Sortase has the potential to provide\na means of linking expressed proteins to a wide range of solid\nsupports which is mild, selective, and can be carried out in a single\nstep. Here we investigate the ability of S. aureus SrtA to ligate proteins\nto a range of solid supports.\nRESULTS\nPlasmid vectors were constructed for the expression of Blue\nfluorescent protein (BFP, Q-Biogene), Enhanced Green Fluores-\ncent Protein (EGFP), a red fluorescent protein (DsRed), and the\nsequence specific DNA binding protein Tus [24] with a C-\nterminal LPETGG sequence followed by a hexahistidine tag. The\nproteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) and purified before\nattachment to solid supports.\nOur first target was the immobilization of proteins onto cross-\nlinked polymer beads. Glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) beads were\nmodified with a spacer followed by one, two, or four glycine\nresidues. Mono-glycine, di-glycine, and tetra-glycine beads were\nincubated with EGFP-LPETGG-His6 (85 mM) and His6-Sortase A\n(40 nM) in Sortase buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl,\n5 mM CaCl2, pH 7.5). As a control, beads with no glycine\ncoupled were incubated with Sortase and EGFP-LPETGG-His6,\nand tetraglycine beads were incubated with EGFP-LPETGG-His6\nin the absence of Sortase. Samples were taken at various time\npoints and beads analysed by FACS (Figure 1) and fluorescence\nmicroscopy (Figure 2). The labeled beads were clearly visible by\nfluorescence microscopy while beads from control reactions\nshowed no increase in fluorescence. Tetra-glycine beads showed\nthe most rapid fluorescence increase and the highest final\nfluorescence. Di-glycine beads were nearly as effective as tetra-\nglycine with mono-glycine beads showing slower increase and\nsignificantly reduced final fluorescence.\nEGFP and the other fluorescent proteins are extremely robust.\nWhile the fluorescence analysis of the ligation of these proteins\ndemonstrates maintenance of function it is therefore of interest to\ndemonstrate that more fragile proteins can be ligated to solid\nsupports while maintaining function. This is crucial for applica-\ntions in supported catalysis or bead-based protein arrays. To\ndemonstrate that ligated protein was functional and accessible to\nother molecules in solution Tus-LPETGG-His6 was immobilized\non tetraglycine GMA beads. Tus is a sequence specific DNA-\nbinding protein that recognizes 21 bp Ter sites [24]. The Tus-\nlabeled GMA beads were incubated with different proportions of\nfluorescein labeled TerB DNA and a 21 bp Cy5-labeled DNA\nsequence unrelated to TerB in binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl,\n250 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM DTT, pH 9). The total\nDNA concentration (Ter plus nonspecific DNA) was 100 nM for\nall samples. The fluorescein and Cy5 fluorescence of the beads was\ndetermined by FACS analysis. Non-specific DNA binding was\nvery low in all cases, consistent with the low affinity of Tus for non-\nspecific DNA in 250 mM KCl [25]. Ter binding showed\na concentration dependence that was consistent with an\nequilibrium dissociation constant of 2968 nM (Figure 3), which\ncompares well with values of KD measured by fluorescence\nanisotropy (,15 nM at 37uC) or Biacore (,1 nM at 25uC) [25].\nTo demonstrate attachment to other solid supports a beaded\nagarose affinity support (Affi-Gel 102 resin, Bio-Rad) was modified\nwith oligoglycine by incubating the amino-resin with diglycine\n(0.5 M) and EDC (2.5 mM) for three hours at 50uC. BFP-, EGFP-,\nand DsRed-LPETGG-His6 were then ligated to the resin\novernight at room temperature. After washing the resin columns\ncould be seen to be clearly labeled with fluorescent protein\n(Figure 4a,b) whereas a control (EGFP without Sortase) showed no\nfluorescence. The labeled Affi-Gel beads were clearly visible by\nfluorescence microscopy (Figure 2).\nFigure 1. Ligation of fluorescent proteins to polymer beads. (a) GMA\nbeads modified with one, two, or four glycine residues were incubated\nwith EGFP-LPETGG-His6 and Sortase. Samples were taken at specific\ntime points and analyzed on a BD FACSAria.

In the absence of Sortase or of oligoglycine no\nfluorescence was observed (Figure 4c,d). In a separate experiment\nno fluorescence was observed for ligation of EGFP without the\nLPETGG tag in the presence of Sortase. A high fluorescence was\nobserved for the positive slide. The labeling is continuous across\nthe modified surface with spots of higher fluorescence (Figure 4e,f).\nDISCUSSION\nProtein ligation to solid supports and surfaces can be a challenging\nproblem. For the examples investigated here Sortase-mediated\nligation has provided a very straightforward and effective means of\nachieving ligation both to bead based solid supports and to\nsurfaces. The ligation provides selective and oriented attachment\nand can be carried out at room temperature under mild aqueous\nconditions and without apparent loss of protein activity or\nspecificity. We have not observed any problems with non-specific\nbinding of proteins under the ligation conditions used here.\nAn important parameter for optimisation of ligation, especially\nenzymatic ligation, is the spacer provided between the surface of\nthe solid support and the point of attachment. In addition to the\nissue of space there is the question of how many glycine residues\nare required for optimal attachment by Sortase. On GMA beads\nwe observe a clear relationship between the number of glycine\nresidues and the rate and yield of attachment with four glycine\nresidues giving the highest yield and most rapid reaction. Two\nglycine residues provides nearly as effective attachment with\nseveral fewer support modification steps required making this the\nmost likely choice for practical applications. The linker de-\npendence contrasts with previously reported studies of the\nsubstrate specificity of Sortase where increasing the number of\nglycines in small molecule substrates did not lead to an increase in\nactivity or substrate binding beyond two glycines and indeed\nglycinamide was nearly as effective a substrate as diglycine [26]. In\npreliminary experiments where we attempted to ligate EGFP to\nplanar gold surfaces through immobilised Gly2-, Gly3-, or Gly4-\nCys peptides we were unable to observe any increase in\nfluorescence above background (see Supplementary Figure S3\nfor an example). These results taken together suggest a complex\nFigure 3. Tus protein ligated to GMA beads is accessible to its\ncognate DNA ligand (Ter). The sequence specific DNA-binding protein\nTus was ligated to diglycine GMA beads. The Tus-labeled beads were\nincubated with varying proportions of fluorescein labeled Ter DNA and\nCy5 labeled non-specific DNA and the bead fluorescence analysed by\nFACS. The curve is a model fit for a single binding process with a KD of\n2968 nM.

The random coupling of oligoglycine\nprovides a convenient means of overcoming this apparent steric\nhindrance but the current data does not provide sufficient\nevidence to identify the optimum linker length for planar surfaces\nor Affigel. The details of linker lengths and identify for the\noptimised use of Sortase mediated ligation both to solid supports\nand to other molecules will need to be established by future work.\nIn comparing Sortase mediated ligation to other methods for\nthe conjugation of proteins to solid supports it is important to\nemphasise the ease of use of this method. Sortase provides a means\nof directly ligating expressed protein with no further modification\nrequired to solid supports. Appropriate supports can be readily\nprepared using straightforward chemistry that is accessible to\nworkers from a wide range of scientific and technical disciplines.\nThere is no requirement for modification of the internal protein\nsequence by removing, for example, undesired cysteines. Nor is there\nany requirement for modification of the protein at the chemical level\nby misincorporation of unnatural amino acids or by further\nmodification of the expressed protein. There is additionally no\nrequirement to handle potentially toxic reagents such as phosphines\nin the preparation of the solid supports. The major drawback of\nSortase mediated ligation is that in its current form it is limited to\nligation through the C-terminus of the protein. If the C-terminus of\na protein is required for function then this will not be an appropriate\nmethod. The second potential drawback of Sortase mediated ligation\nis the requirement for the preparation of Sortase. However the\nprotein is easily over expressed and purified in large yields.\nIn conclusion we have shown that Sortase-mediated ligation\nprovides a convenient and mild approach to the covalent linkage\nof proteins to a range of relevant solid supports including cross-\nlinked polymer beads, affinity resins, and flat surfaces. This\napproach is applicable to any protein that can be functionally\nexpressed and purified with a short peptide tag at the C-terminus\nof the protein. This makes the approach widely applicable to\nproteins which have specific orientational requirements or which\nare rendered inactive by non-specific modification. In contrast to\nthe use of target-intein fusions for immobilisation, where the\nexpression of large fusion proteins can be a problem, the small tag\nis much less likely to have an effect on expression. In addition\nSortase-mediated ligation is applicable to any solid support which\ncan be modified to provide an oligoglycine motif. Sortase therefore\nprovides a robust method for protein ligation to solid supports that\nis effective, easy to use, and very general.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nPlasmids and protein expression\nThe srtA gene was amplified from S. aureus genomic DNA (ATCC\n35556D) using primers srtaf (59-ATATTTGCATATGAAACCA-\nCATATCGATAATTATC) and srtab (59-ATTGAATTCGAT-\nTATTTGACTTCTGTAGCTACAAG) which remove the N-\nterminal membrane targeting region and add an NdeI site at the\nstart codon and add an EcoRI site just beyond the stop codon\n(restriction sites underlined). The PCR product was digested with\nNdeI and EcoRI and inserted into pETMCSIII [25] for the\nexpression of a SortaseA construct with the N-terminal membrane\ntargeting sequence removed and replaced with a His6 tag for\naffinity purification, similar to that previously described [19]. The\nprotein was readily purified in high yield by Ni-affinity\nchromatography. For reasons which are not clear Sortase migrates\nanomalously in SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular weight of\n,30 kDa (see also Figure 5 in Reference [19]).\nPlasmid vectors for the expression of target proteins with a C-\nterminal LPETGG-His6 tag were designed with an in frameXhoI site\nto replace the native stop codon and an NdeI site at the start codon.\nGenes coding for BFP (derived from pQBI-T7-BFP, Q-Biogene,\nhttp:\/\/www.qbiogene.com\/technical\/maps\/txt\/s-pQBI-T7-BFP.\ntxt), EGFP (BFP with S66T, H67Ymutations), DsRed (derived from\npDsRed-Monomer, Clontech, http:\/\/www.clontech.com\/images\/\npt\/PT3794-5.pdf), and the E. coli Tus protein (derived from\npCM862 [25]) were inserted into these vectors, and protein\nexpressed and purified by Ni-affinity chromatography (BFP-,\nEGFP-, DsRed-LPETGG-His6) or a two column ion exchange\nprocedure adapted from that previously described (Tus-LPETGG-\nHis6 [25]). The details of the plasmid construction and protein\npurification will be reported elsewhere. The full predicted sequence\nof the proteins is given in Supplementary Data S1.\nManipulations of solid supports\nGMA beads (5 mm, Bangs Laboratories) were modified with an\naminooctanoic acid spacer and one, two, or four glycine residues\nadded by standard Fmoc chemistry with TBTU coupling. The\nfinal loading of the beads (by quantitative ninhydrin test) was\n5 mmol.g21 for all but tetra-glycine beads (2 mmol.g21).\nAffi-Gel 102 Resin (Bio-Rad) was modified with oligoglycine by\nincubation with diglycine (0.5 M) and EDC (2.5 mM) for three\nhours at 50uC. Clean glass coverslips were incubated in 2%\ntriethoxy(aminopropyl) silane for 30 seconds, washed with acetone\nand air dried. Oligoglycine was coupled to the surface overnight\nby incubation with diglycine (0.5 M) and EDC (2.5 mM) at room\ntemperature.\nCollection of FACS data\nFACS data was obtained on a BD FACSAria. Beads were\ncollected by centrifugation and resuspended in FacsFlow (BD\nBioscience). A total of 1000 events (Figure 1) or 5000 events\n(Figure 3) was recorded for each time point. The population of\nsingle beads (i.e. not bead doublets or higher aggregates) was\nselected based on forward and side scatter) and the mean\nfluorescence of this population determined (Fluorescein: 488 nm\nlaser excitation, 530\/30 nm emission filter, Cy5: 633 nm laser\nexcitation, 670\/20 emission filter, see Supplementary Data S2 for\ndata used to generate Figures 1 and 3 and Supplementary Figure\nS1 for an example of the raw FACS data).\nFluorescence microscopy\nImages were obtained on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 fluorescence\nmicroscope with mercury vapour lamp illumination and FITC\nand Cy3 filter sets. Images were captured on a Hamamatsu ORCA-\nER grey scale digital camera using Simple PCI software. For colour\npanels in Figure 2 separate grey scale images were taken with FITC\nand Cy3 filter sets with the autoexposure setting in Simple PCI.

Upper panel negative control (no\nSortase). Lower panel, attempted ligation with Sortase. The lower\npanel is slightly out of focus. Similar results were seen with the\npeptides H-G3C-OH and H-G4C-OH.\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0001164.s005 (0.53 MB\nDOC)\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: CN LC GC.
