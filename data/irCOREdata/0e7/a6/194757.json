Ionosphere (auroral ionosphere) \u2013 Magneto-\nspheric physics (MHD waves and instabilities) \u2013 Radio sci-\nence (ionospheric physics)\n1 Introduction\nThe use of ground-based radars for making observations\nof the terrestrial ionosphere and the subsequent diagnosis\nof dynamic magnetospheric regions and processes is well\nfounded. The Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (Super-\nCorrespondence to: D. M. Wright\n(dmw7@ion.le.ac.uk)\nDARN; Greenwald et al., 1995) of HF coherent radars is pri-\nmarily designed to monitor the global ionospheric convec-\ntion pattern, which traces the motion of magnetospheric field\nlines under the influence of solar-terrestrial coupling. An-\nother important application of these radars involves sounding\nthe very high latitude ionosphere in the polar cap and cusp,\nin order to diagnose the dynamic phenomena which are on-\ngoing in these regions. The spectral width associated with\nbackscatter from ionospheric irregularities is variable and of-\nten exhibits sharp boundaries, which relate to changes in the\noverlying geophysical regimes. In fact, it has been proposed\nthat the boundary between high and low spectral widths,\nthe latter usually occurring at lower latitudes, might be a\ngood way of identifying the open-closed field line bound-\nary (OCFLB). There seems to be a very good agreement be-\ntween the OCFLB and the Spectral Width Boundary (SWB)\non the dayside. However, recent studies involving space-\ncraft measurements of high energy particles in the magneto-\nsphere and auroral imager observations in conjunction with\nground-based measurements have indicated that these two\ndemarcators are not always coincident. These observations\nare the subject of a forthcoming paper. Presented in this pa-\nper are data from the Hankasalmi, Finland radar, one of the\nCUTLASS (Co-operative UK Twin Located Auroral Sound-\ning System; Milan et al., 1997) bistatic pair and a subset of\nSuperDARN. The observed radar spectral widths associated\nwith a series of dusk-sector equatorward-propagating tran-\nsient features are compared with dynamic spectral measure-\nments of the Pc1-2 wave band from a newly deployed induc-\ntion coil magnetometer located in Troms\u00f8, Norway.\nThe SuperDARN radars transmit a multipulse code and\nthe received signals for each range gate are converted into\nan autocorrelation function (ACF). Parameters, such as the\nbackscatter power (relating to irregularity intensity), line-of-\nsight velocity of the scattering irregularities and the spec-\ntral width can be extracted from the ACF after it is pro-\ncessed using the fitacf fitting routine (e.g. Villain et al.,\n1987). It is well known that the spectral width of coher-\nent HF radar returns is sensitive to the various regions of\n1844 D. M. Wright et al.: The effects of high-frequency ULF wave activity on coherent HF radar returns\nthe ionosphere and the dynamic processes in the coupled\nmagnetosphere-ionosphere system (e.g. Baker et al., 1995;\nLester et al., 2001; Woodfield et al., 2002). A number of\nmechanisms have been suggested to explain the increased\nspectral widths associated with radar backscatter from the\ncusp. These include (Andre\u00b4 et al., 2000b) micro-scale tur-\nbulence affecting the ionospheric irregularities, the existence\nof time-varying electric fields caused by ULF wave activity,\nstrong flow shears in the large-scale convection pattern and\ninhomogeneities localised within the radar range cell, such\nas small-scale field-aligned currents and vortices.\nBaker et al. (1995) and Moen et al. (2001) showed that\nHF radar echoes from the cusp commonly exhibit multiple-\npeaked spectra with large widths. Andre\u00b4 et al. (1999,\n2000a, b) suggested that these widths might be the result of\nULF wave activity in the Pc1-2 band, which are often ob-\nserved at cusp latitudes (e.g. Maynard et al., 1991; Menk\net al., 1992; Erlandson and Anderson, 1996; Dyrud et al.,\n1997). Andre\u00b4 et al. (1999, 2000a, b) modelled the effects of\nbroad-band ESIC waves and narrow-band EMIC waves on\nHF radar observations. However, an error in their modelling\ncode failed to properly account for time-dependent veloc-\nity variations associated with the wave electric field (Pono-\nmarenko and Waters, 2003) and as a result, overestimated\nthe effects of ion-cyclotron waves on HF radar observations.\nAs a consequence, Ponomarenko and Waters (2003) favour\nsmall-scale spatio-temporal structures due to particle precip-\nitation inside a radar range cell for causing the observed large\nspectral widths in the cusp regions. Thus, the significance of\nhigh-frequency waves to large radar spectral widths is still\na matter of great debate. However, away from the cusp re-\ngion, Wright et al. (2004) presented CUTLASS radar spec-\ntral widths associated with irregularities artificially generated\nby the EISCAT (European Incoherent Scatter) high power\nheating facility at Troms\u00f8 (Rietveld et al., 1993). They re-\nported increases in spectral width which occurred during pe-\nriods of Pc1\u20132 wave activity, as detected by an induction coil\nmagnetometer at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi, Finland. The increased spec-\ntral widths were observed to be correlated, both spatially\nand temporally, with localised regions of Pc4 waves believed\nto be driven by wave-particle interactions between field-line\neigenmodes and unstable drifting energetic ion-populations\nconstituting part of the ring current. Wright et al. (2004)\ninterpreted the spectral width features as the result of high-\nfrequency ion-cyclotron wave activity, driven by the same\nenergetic ions, causing a broadening of the received radar\nspectra. They also suggested that this effect might provide\na proxy for investigation of high-frequency wave activity in-\nside the cusp.\nAt high latitudes, waves with frequencies in the Pc1\u20132\nrange (0.1\u20135 Hz) include both electrostatic ion cyclotron\n(ESIC) and electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves. In\ncontrast to ground magnetometers, which measure magnetic\nsignatures, radars detect changes in electric fields. Thus,\na ground magnetometer will only detect EMIC waves and\nthose ESIC waves that are associated with current systems\n(and therefore have a magnetic signature). Technically then,\nPc1\u20132 waves are those detected on the ground by magne-\ntometers. ULF waves in this frequency band in the nightside\nmagnetosphere are generally classified as Pi1 waves, where\nthe \u201ci\u201d refers to their irregular, non-continuous wave period.\nPiB waves are a subset of Pi1s (e.g. Heacock, 1967), which\nare generally associated with the occurrence of substorms\nand pseudo-breakups (e.g. Akasofu, 1964; Troitskaya, 1961)\nand have been used to identify their onset. PiBs are charac-\nterised by broad-band wave activity appearing in a burst-like\nfashion.\nThis paper discusses an interval of HF radar data where\nfeatures exhibiting large spectral widths are observed si-\nmultaneously with broad-band high-frequency wave activ-\nity and which appear to be related to substorm and pseudo-\nbreakup occurrence. In their standard mode of operation\nauto-correlation functions (ACFs) are formed every 100 ms\nand thus this could sample the electric fields associated with\nwaves in the Pc1\u20132 band without a loss of temporal resolu-\ntion. However, in an attempt to reduce cross-range noise the\nradar data are subsequently integrated to provide one mea-\nsurement every 3 or 7 s, and this reduction in temporal res-\nolution will lead to a loss of spectral information associated\nwith individual waves which will then act to broaden individ-\nual spectra.\n2 Instrumentation\nThe ionospheric convection velocities presented in this pa-\nper were measured by the Hankasalmi radar which forms\none-half of the CUTLASS bistatic HF radar (Milan et al.,\n1997). They have overlapping fields of view, which, in their\nstandard operational mode, encompass the ionosphere over\nNorthern Scandinavia and the northern polar cap region at\nhigher latitudes. Signals returned to the radars have under-\ngone a Bragg-like backscattering process from field-aligned\nelectron density irregularities in the ionosphere. The CUT-\nLASS data reproduced here have a range resolution of 45 km\n(with the first range starting at 180 km from the radar) and a\ntemporal resolution of 1 min on each beam.\nThe Wave Excitation Experimental Diagnostic (WEED) is\nan induction coil magnetometer designed to observe high-\nfrequency waves in the Pc1-2 band. It was recently deployed\nat the Troms\u00f8 Geophysical Observatory (69.7\u25e6 N, 19.4\u25e6 E ge-\nographic) and consists of two orthogonally aligned sensors\nmonitoring magnetic field variations in northwards and east-\nwards directions (\u2212dH\/dt and \u2212dD\/dt, respectively). It sam-\nples data at 0.1 s resolution. It is most responsive to wave fre-\nquencies of about 1 Hz.

Bottom: Simultaneous X- and Y- component data from the\nTroms\u00f8 (TRO) IMAGE magnetometer.\nwidth data from beam 5 of the CUTLASS Hankasalmi (Fin-\nland) radar are shown in the top panel of Fig. 1. Beam 5\noverlays Troms\u00f8 and data from the magnetometers at this lo-\ncation are illustrated in the lower two panels of Fig. 1. The\nmiddle panel shows the time evolution of the dynamic spec-\ntral power of the WEED observations in the frequency range\n0.1\u20132 Hz (representing most of the Pc1\u20132 band). There are\nno significant features observed above 2 Hz. The data from\nthe TRO magnetometer are also plotted in the lower panel\nof this figure. In the examination of the data prior to (not\nshown) and including the interval shown in Fig. 1, it is clear\nthat the radar scatter moves gradually equatorwards (towards\nthe radar). This is likely to be related to a combination of\nan expanding polar cap due to a substorm growth phase and\nto the relative position of the auroral oval with respect to the\nradar location as the Earth rotates. The backscatter exhibits\na sharp spectral width boundary (SWB) where the poleward\nscatter have widths considerably >200 m s\u22121 in contrast to\nthose at lower latitudes which are typically <100 m s\u22121. If\nthe data from 22:00\u201323:00 UT are examined more closely, a\nnumber of equatorward excursions of the SWB are apparent,\nmost notably as \u201cbursts\u201d in the spectral width commencing\nat about 22:10, 22:30 and 22:40 UT. In each case a distinct\nand sudden enhancement of the spectral power measured by\nWEED is apparent. The spectral width features move rapidly\nequatorwards and pass over Troms\u00f8, which is conjugate to\nrange gate 17 of beam 5 in the CUTLASS data. Measure-\nments made over the whole IMAGE magnetometer chain, of\nwhich only TRO are shown here (lower panel of Fig. 1), sug-\ngest that these events are related to substorm activity. The\nspectral width features at 22:10 and 22:30 UT coincide with\nwhat appears to be pseudo-breakups, and these precede a\nsubstorm onset just after 22:40 UT which seems to be respon-\nsible for the radar features at that time.\nThis paper aims to address what is causing the associated\nchanges in the spectral width parameter. During the substorm\nprocess, distended field lines dipolarise, releasing their mag-\nnetic tension as they travel towards the Earth. This also leads\nto the motion of plasma trapped on the field line in question,\nresulting in plasma precipitation into the ionosphere. In ad-\ndition, some of the energy released during the magnetic field\ndipolarisation and subsequent ringing of the field lines will\noccur in the form of Alfve\u00b4n waves travelling along the field\nlines towards the Earth. Sometimes the wave activity occurs\nover a broad frequency range covering the Pc1-5 bands. As\ndiscussed earlier, bursty and broad-band wave energy of this\ntype manifests itself on the ground as a PiB signature.\n1846 D. M.

Plotted in Fig. 2c is\nthe summed \u2212dH\/dt and \u2212dD\/dt spectral power detected\nby the WEED magnetometer in the frequency range 0.1\u2013\n5 Hz (equivalent to the combined Pc1-2 bands). Also shown\n(Fig. 2d) is the total spectral power across the whole equiva-\nlent Pc1-5 band (0.002\u20135 Hz). Although a perfect one-to-one\nrelationship between the radar measurements and the broad-\nband wave power on the ground does not exist (see Figs. 2b\u2013\nd), it can be seen that a number of common features can be\nidentified. In general, the spectral power in the whole ULF\nwave band most closely correlates with the variation on the\nspectral width. However, the Pc1-2 power variations appear\nstrongly related to the width changes. Common increases in\nradar spectral width and WEED Pc1-2 power are observed\nat around 22:10, 22:30 and 22:40 UT (marked by the vertical\ndashed lines labelled A\u2013C). Comparison of the WEED spec-\ntral power variations (Figs. 2c and 2d) with time series of the\nline-of-sight velocity and spectral width at range 17 (Figs. 2a\nand 2b, respectively), clearly show that when there is an in-\ncrease in high-frequency wave power (Fig. 2c), there is al-\nways a corresponding increase in the radar spectral width.\nThis is indicated by the dashed lines marked A\u2013G on Fig. 2.\nHowever, it should be noted that there appears to be no cor-\nrelation between the magnitudes of these respective changes.\nThe effect also appears to be distinct from the effects of the\nbroad-band wave power, as illustrated in Fig. 2d. Through-\nout this interval the beam 5 line-of sight velocity detected by\nthe radar indicates that flow was generally towards the radar,\nwith an average flow speed of 300\u2013400 m s\u22121.

Overlaid on each cell are velocity power spectra derived from the FFT of the radar ACF directly. Vertical lines indicate zero\nDoppler velocity. Bottom: The number of spectral peaks identified, within 3 dB of the peak spectral power.\nthis time is located very close to local midnight, and these\nflows are consistent with antisunward irregularity flow over\nthe pole, forming part of the global convection pattern. How-\never, most of the increases in high-frequency wave power la-\nbelled A\u2013G, including those associated with the bursty spec-\ntral width features (A\u2013C), are coincident with, or shortly fol-\nlowed by, sudden and short-lived reductions (and sometimes\nreversals) of the line-of-sight flow of up to 400 m s\u22121. It\nseems likely that this effect is related to the substorm-type\nprocesses which are ongoing in the magnetotail. However,\nthese observations will be the subject of a future study.\nThe observations presented here support the view that, for\nthis event, high-frequency wave activity could be the cause\nof the increases in the radar spectral width. On this day, the\nradar integrated its data over 3 s and this would then smooth\nout any effects due to the rapidly varying wave electric fields\n(see Sect. 1). The only way to properly resolve these mod-\nulations would be to examine the radar data at the pulse-\nsequence repetition rate of 100 ms. Such experiments are\ncurrently being undertaken.\nThere has been much discussion regarding the expected\nform of the received radar spectra. It has been suggested\n(Baker et al., 1995; Moen et al., 2001; Andre\u00b4 et al., 2000b)\nthat many of the mechanisms which might lead to modifi-\ncation of the radar ACF would generate multi-peaked spec-\ntra. These would, in general, be the result of short-scale\nspatio-temporal changes occurring within a radar range cell.\nFor example, a strong velocity shear or a vortical structure\nperhaps caused by a small-scale field-aligned current sys-\ntem would present more than one velocity component to\nthe radar, and these would appear as multiple components\nin the radar spectra. In contrast to this, single component\nbroadened spectra would be expected from electric fields ex-\nhibiting fast temporal variation due to the combination of\nthe low spectral resolution of the radar measurements and\nthe data integration subsequently performed by the radar in\norder to remove cross-range noise. ULF wave activity in\nthe Pc1-2 band would then be expected to cause broad but\nsingle-component spectra. Highly complex spatio-temporal\nstructures could also lead to similar broadening, if the ACF\nfailed to resolve the multiple velocity components separately.\nFigure 3 addresses this issue for the data presented here.\nThe top panel of Fig. 3 shows a section of the radar spec-\ntral width data displayed in Fig. 1. The data for the in-\nterval 22:09:30\u201322:19:30 UT have been selected since they\ncover the first equatorward excursion of the spectral width\nfeatures (see Fig. 1). Overlaid on each colour-coded range\ncell is the appropriate power spectrum derived from the fast\n1848 D. M. Wright et al.: The effects of high-frequency ULF wave activity on coherent HF radar returns\nFourier transform of the radar ACF. The lower panel of Fig. 3\nis colour-coded to show the number of discernible spectral\npeaks from the spectra in the top panel. Only those spectral\npeaks which are greater than a threshold of 50% of the peak\npower in each spectrum are included (this level is marked by\nthe horizontal dashed line in the spectra of the top panel).\nFigure 3 then clearly shows that the radar spectra during this\ninterval do not possess multiple peaks and, in fact, exhibit\nonly one broad spectral peak. This suggests that if high-\nfrequency waves are dominating the received radar spectra,\nthen the broad-band electric field modulations detected by\nthe radar are being smoothed out by a combination of the\nspectral resolution of the ACF and the subsequent fitting pro-\ncess routinely applied to the data. In addition, the spectral\nwidths of the features in the radar data peak at values of\naround 400 m s\u22121, which implies that the Pc1-2 waves must\nbe modulating the velocity by up to 200 m s\u22121 (equivalent\nto electric fields of \u223c10 mV m\u22121). This is consistent with\nspacecraft observations of the electric fields associated with\nconjugate ground measurements of Pc1 waves in the auroral\nzone (e.g. Erlandson et al., 1990; Mursula et al., 2001).\n4 Summary\nThe purpose of this paper was to discuss a potential mech-\nanism causing large spectral widths in coherent HF radar\nmeasurements. During an interval when the spectral width\nboundary exhibited a series of sudden equatorward moving\nbursts, broad-band ULF wave activity was detected on the\nground at Troms\u00f8 using a new induction coil magnetometer\ncalled WEED. These features appear to be related to pseudo-\nbreakups and substorm onsets observed over the Scandina-\nvian sector near local midnight. A detailed discussion of the\nmagnetospheric processes responsible for these bursty spec-\ntral changes is the subject of a future study. However, the\nclear correlation between the broadening of the radar spec-\ntra and the occurrence of high-frequency wave activity pro-\nvides evidence to support the suggestion that such short time-\nscale processes may lead to increased spectral widths. This\ncertainly appears to be the case for this interval at least. It\nis likely that spectral broadening is the direct result of the\nsmoothing of the electric field modulations associated with\nthe ULF waves as a result of integrating the backscattered\nsignal received by the radar. The investigation of such pro-\ncesses offers the opportunity to gain insight into similar pro-\ncesses which are observed at higher latitudes. The mech-\nanisms causing the characteristically high spectral widths\nrecorded in the cusp is still a matter of considerable debate.\nAcknowledgements.
