New Chandra data show that the X-ray source is point-like, with a\nluminosity of 5:2 \u0002 1039 erg s21 \u00850:5\u20138 keV\u0086. It displays medium- and long-term X-ray\nvariability in observations spanning a period of 20 yr. The accurate Chandra position allows\nus to identify a blue optical continuum source \u0085mv \u0088 19:7\u0086 at the position of NGC 5204 X-1,\nusing newly obtained optical data from the INTEGRAL instrument on the William Herschel\nTelescope. The X-ray and optical source properties are consistent with the scenario in which\nwe are observing the beamed X-ray emission of a high-mass X-ray binary in NGC 5204,\ncomposed of an O star with either a black hole or neutron star companion.\nKey words: galaxies: individual: NGC 5204 \u2013 galaxies: stellar content \u2013 X-rays: galaxies.\n1 I N T R O D U C T I O N\nEinstein imaging observations were the first to reveal that the X-ray\nemission of many spiral galaxies is dominated by a small number\nof luminous \u0085LX , 1038\u201340 erg s21\u0086 discrete X-ray sources located\noutside the nucleus of the galaxy (Fabbiano 1989, and references\ntherein). ROSAT and ASCA observations have since confirmed the\npresence of one or more luminous extra-nuclear sources in many\nindividual nearby galaxies, for example Dwingeloo 1 (Reynolds\net al. 1997), Holmberg II (Zezas, Georgantopoulos & Ward 1999),\nNGC 5194 (Marston et al. 1995) and NGC 4321 (Immler, Pietsch\n& Aschenbach 1998). Early results from the Chandra observatory\nhave extended this theme, most notably with the resolution of a\nhigh-luminosity \u0085LX , 1040\u201341 erg s21\u0086, variable X-ray source\nlocated just off-nucleus in the nearby starburst galaxy M82\n(Kaaret et al. 2001; Matsumoto et al. 2001). In a recent survey\nusing archival ROSAT High Resolution Imager (HRI) observations,\nRoberts & Warwick (2000, hereafter RW2000) catalogued 29\nsources with LX . 10\n39 erg s21 in the 0:1\u20132:4 keV ROSAT band in\na variety of nearby galaxies. Each of these sources is at least as\nluminous as a 10-M( black hole accreting at close to its Eddington\nlimit; however, the nature of these super-Eddington sources (SES1)\nremains unclear. Known candidates for explaining the SES\nphenomena include recent supernovae\/very young supernova\nremnants (SNRs), accretion on to a compact object, or unresolved\ncomplexes of X-ray sources.\nSupernovae exploding into a dense circumstellar medium can\nproduce very X-ray-luminous nebulae in their early stages (e.g. SN\n1988Z with LX , 1041 erg s21 : Fabian & Terlevich 1996), and\nindeed several of the RW2000 SES sample can be identified with\nrecent supernovae, for example SN 1979C ; NGC 4321 X-4\n(Immler et al. 1998) and SN 1986J ; NGC 891 X-3 (Bregman &\nPildis 1992).\nAlternatively, accretion processes may power much of the SES\npopulation. Evidence in favour of accretion comes from an ASCA\nstudy of several SES (Makishima et al. 2000), in which the spectra\nare shown to be well fitted by multicolour disc blackbody (MCD)\nemission from an optically thick standard accretion disc around a\nblack hole. The unusually high temperatures required to fit these\nsystems suggest that SES are analogous to the Galactic micro-\nquasars GRO 1655240 and GRS 19151105, and may be powered\nby accretion on to rapidly rotating high stellar mass (a few tens of\nM() black holes. In a similar vein, Colbert & Mushotzky (1999)\nsuggested that some SES observed to be marginally offset from\ngalactic nuclei (on scales of several hundred parsecs) in ROSAT\nHRI observations are not a type of low-luminosity AGN, but in fact\nconstitute a new class of \u2018intermediate-mass\u2019 accreting black holes\nhaving masses of 102\u2013104 M(. The key to recognizing SES as\naccreting systems is, of course, via significant variability; indeed,\nsome systems are already known to display short-term variability\nover time-scales of ,1000 s (IC 342 X-1, Okada et al. 1998;\nHolmberg II source, Zezas et al. 1999). Also, recent ASCA studies\nhave demonstrated that long-term variability is present in several\nPE-mail: tro@star.le.ac.uk\n1 A note on taxonomy: we refer to the class of LX . 10\n39 erg s21 extra-\nnuclear sources as SESs throughout this Letter. This class of object is\nalternatively referred to as super-luminous X-ray sources (SLS),\nintermediate-luminosity X-ray objects (IXOs) or ultra-luminous compact\nX-ray sources (ULXs) in the literature, although the last acronym refers in\nparticular to objects suspected to be powered by accretion.\nMon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 325, L7\u2013L11 (2001)\nq 2001 RAS\n at Leicester U\nniversity Library on A\nugust 8, 2013\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nSES, and is accompanied by transitions in the X-ray spectra of the\nobjects between \u2018hard\u2019 and \u2018soft\u2019 states (Mizuno, Kubota &\nMakishima 2001; Kubota et al. 2001).\nUnfortunately, X-ray data from the pre-Chandra era are severely\nspatially limited and so moderately compact complexes of X-ray-\nemitting sources (e.g. a cluster of low-mass X-ray binaries, each\nradiating at close to its Eddington luminosity, or a giant H II region\ncontaining one or more X-ray binaries plus a diffuse component)\ncould not be spatially distinguished from bona fide individual\nexamples of the SES phenomenon. This problem can now be\naddressed with the order-of-magnitude improvement in spatial\nresolution offered by Chandra.\nA key to understanding the nature of the SES would be an\nidentification with a known class of object, and follow-up studies at\nother wavelengths. This is now also possible because of the high\nastrometric accuracy achievable with Chandra data (,0.6 arcsec\nrms: Proposer\u2019s Observatory Guide v3.0). We may also address two\ninteresting and related questions. The first is: what is the effect of\nan ionizing flux amounting to more than 1039 erg s21 upon its\nimmediate surroundings? The second concerns the local galactic\nenvironment of the SES: what does this tell us about the nature of\nthe source itself?\nTo these ends, we have recently acquired Chandra Advanced\nCCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS-S) X-ray data and William\nHerschel Telescope\/INTEGRAL field spectrograph optical data for\na number of prominent SES in the RW2000 sample. In this Letter\nwe report an important early result of this programme, the possible\nidentification of an optical counterpart to NGC 5204 X-1. This SES\nis located in the nearby \u0085d \u0088 4:8 Mpc : Tully 1988) magellanic-\ntype galaxy NGC 5204. The presence of a luminous \u0085log LX ,\n39:8 erg s21\u0086X-ray source in NGC 5204 was first shown in Einstein\ndata (Fabbiano, Kim & Trinchieri 1992). This source has more\nrecently been reported in ROSAT HRI data, where it is seen to be\nslightly offset from the nucleus of the galaxy (Colbert &\nMushotzky 1999; RW2000; Lira, Lawrence & Johnson 2000)\nand is therefore identified as a possible SES as opposed to a low-\nluminosity active galactic nucleus candidate. In Section 2 we report\nthe results of a 10-ks Chandra X-ray observation of this source.\nThe William Herschel Telescope\/INTEGRAL follow-up obser-\nvation is then detailed in Section 3, followed (in Section 4) by a\ndiscussion of what this reveals about the nature of the SES.\n2 X - R AY DATA\nNGC 5204 X-1 was observed by Chandra on 2001 January 9 for a\nsingle exposure of 10.1 ks. The target was positioned on the back-\nilluminated ACIS-S S3 chip, which was operated in the standard\n1\/8 sub-array mode in order to alleviate the anticipated effects of\npile-up in the target source. Data were reduced and analysed using\nthe CIAO software version 2.0.1, starting with the level 2 event files.\nThe in-orbit background was at a constant low level during the\nobservation, and therefore we did not need to reject any exposure\ntime because of background flare contamination.\nFig. 1 shows a Digitized Sky Survey 2 image of the galaxy. Only\ntwo X-ray sources are detected in the Chandra data: NGC 5204\nX-1 (at 13h29m38:s6,15882500600), and a very faint source which\nlies ,15 arcsec to its south-east (at 13h29m40:s3,15882405400). The\nnucleus of the galaxy does not contain a luminous X-ray source.\nNGC 5204 X-1 appears point-like. Fitting the two-dimensional\nprofile of the X-ray source with a Gaussian model confirms that it is\nunresolved \u2013 the half-energy width is found to be 0.8 arcsec, which\nmatches that found in an on-axis ACIS observation of the point\nsource PG 16342706 [Chandra Proposer\u2019s Observatory Guide\n(2000), fig. 6.3]. We can therefore rule out any significant extended\ncomponent of size greater than ,0.5 arcsec (;12 pc in NGC 5204)\ncontributing to the X-ray emission.\nNGC 5204 X-1 has an observed ACIS-S count rate of\n0.41 count s21 and so the observation suffers from pile-up at the\n,10 per cent level. This leads to a small distortion of the X-ray\nspectrum towards a harder form, and a slight underestimate of the\ntrue count rate; however, for our present purpose we make a\npreliminary spectral analysis ignoring pile-up effects (a more\ncomplete study will be the subject of future work). An X-ray\nspectrum was extracted for NGC 5204 X-1 using the appropriate\nCIAO tools, and analysed using the standard X-ray spectral fitting\npackage XSPEC. We limited spectral analysis to the 0:5\u201310 keV\nband; however, in reality very few counts were observed above\n5 keV. The spectrum appears relatively featureless, and the best fits\nto the data were found to be either a simple power-law continuum\nabsorbed by cold, neutral material \u0085NH \u0088 1:6 ^ 0:3 \u0002\n1021 atom cm22; G \u0088 2:4 ^ 0:1, x2n \u0088 1:27 for 112 degrees of\nfreedom) or an absorbed thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum\n\u0085NH \u0088 5:4 ^ 1:7 \u0002 1020 atom cm22, kT \u0088 2:6 ^ 0:3 keV, x2n \u0088\n1:25\u0086: Both a pure thermal plasma (MEKAL) model and the\nMCD model favoured in ASCA studies of ULXs (e.g. Makishima\net al. 2000) were rejected. More complex models do not\nsignificantly improve the spectral fit. It is notable that the source\nspectrum appears soft, even after any hardening arising from pile-\nup. The observed flux was 1:9 \u0002 10212 erg cm22 s21 (0.5\u20138 keV),\nwhich equates to a luminosity of 5:2 \u0002 1039 erg s21 assuming that\nthe source is located at the distance of NGC 5204.\nThe temporal characteristics of the source were also\ninvestigated. The short-term light curve from the ACIS-S\nobservation shows no detectable variability over the 10-ks\nobservation (a x 2 test against the hypothesis that the flux level\nremains constant gives x 2 \u0088 31 for 50 degrees of freedom).\nHowever, long-term variability is detected. In Fig. 2 we show the\nlong-term light curve, composed of archival measurements from\nFigure 1. Chandra source positions overlaid on to the Digitized Sky Survey\n2 image of the central 2:5 \u0002 2:5 arcmin2 region of NGC 5204. The coverage\nof the Chandra sub-array is shown by the parallel lines, and the galaxy\nnucleus is marked by an asterisk. The position of NGC 5204 X-1 is\nindicated by the crossed circle, and the faint Chandra detection by a small\nfilled circle.\nL8 T. P. Roberts et al.\nq 2001 RAS, MNRAS 325, L7\u2013L11\n at Leicester U\nniversity Library on A\nugust 8, 2013\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nthe Einstein and ROSAT missions plus the new data point. The light\ncurve uses the best-fitting model to the Chandra data and, using\neither PIMMS or XSPEC, folds it through the response of each\nmission that detected NGC 5204 X-1. In each case the flux is\nnormalized to the observed count rate, and fluxes are compared in\nthe 0:5\u20132 keV band (chosen as it is covered by all the relevant\nmissions). The resulting light curve shows a doubling of the flux in\nthe 20 yr between the Einstein Imaging Proportional Counter (IPC)\nand Chandra ACIS-S observations, suggesting that the rising flux\nmay represent a long-term trend. However, medium-term\nvariability is also apparent in the ROSAT Position Sensitive\nProportional Counter (PSPC) observations, showing a flux increase\nof ,50 per cent in 11 months between 1993 and 1994. The latter\nvariability is a strong pointer to the origin of the X-ray emission in\naccretion on to a compact object.\n3 O P T I C A L DATA\nThe optical data were taken on the nights of 2001 February 1 and 2,\nusing the INTEGRAL field spectrograph (Arribas et al. 1998)\nmounted on the William Herschel Telescope, La Palma.\nINTEGRAL provides simultaneous optical spectroscopy and,\nthrough the relative positions of the fibres, imaging. We used the\n\u2018SB2\u2019 fibre configuration, which gave us a field of view of 16:5 \u0002\n12:3 arcsec2 covered by 189 fibres, each of diameter 0.9 arcsec. In\nthis configuration an additional 30 fibres, at a radius of 45 arcsec,\nprovide a measure of the local sky background for each\nobservation. The R600R grating was used, giving a wavelength\ncoverage of ,4500\u20137500 \u0017A and resolution ,6 A\u02da, and data were\nread out through WYFFOS. The target was observed for a total of\n2 h, split into three sections over the two nights.\nThe fibre data were reduced in the standard fashion. This will be\ndiscussed in detail in a future paper (Goad et al., in preparation).\nThe data reduction ultimately provided a flux-calibrated spectrum\nfor each individual fibre, which were used to form the multicolour\nnarrow-band images.\nFig. 3 shows six reconstructed images of the field centred on the\nposition of NGC 5204 X-1, in a variety of narrow continuum bands\nand continuum-subtracted emission-line bands, with the Chandra\nX-ray emission contours overlaid. It is immediately obvious that an\noptical continuum source is present at or close to the position of the\nX-ray source. This source is not detected in any continuum-\nsubtracted emission-line image. Inspection of the data shows that\nthe continuum emission is detected in a single fibre, numbered 113,\nimplying that the continuum source is point-like at the 0.9-arcsec\nresolution of INTEGRAL. This fibre is positioned immediately to\nFigure 2. Long-term X-ray light curve of NGC 5204 X-1. This covers seven\nobservations over 20 yr. Einstein data are indicated by a triangle, ROSAT\nPSPC data by squares, ROSAT HRI data by circles and the new Chandra\ndata point by an asterisk. The count rates (converted to fluxes as per the text)\nwere taken from Fabbiano et al. (1992; Einstein IPC), the ROSAT All-Sky\nSurvey bright source catalogue (Voges et al. 1999) and WGACAT (White,\nGiommi & Angelini 1994) (ROSAT PSPC), and RW2000 (ROSAT HRI).\nErrors shown in the plot are 1s.\nFigure 3. Reconstructed narrow-band INTEGRAL images. The images are in decreasing wavelength order, from top left to bottom right, and are in an arbitrary\nlogarithmic grey-scale with white corresponding to the highest emission values. Note that all emission-line images are continuum-subtracted, and we use the\n6000\u20136200 and 5100\u20135200 \u0017A ranges for the red and blue continuum images respectively.

We have estimated the probability of it\nbeing a background or foreground object, unrelated to NGC 5204,\nusing an APM source list for a blank 30 \u0002 30 arcmin2 field offset to\nthe north-east of NGC 5204. The observed magnitude of the\ncounterpart is mv \u0088 19:7; the chance of a background or\nforeground object of this magnitude falling within the error circle\nis very small \u0085P < 3 \u0002 1024\u0086. Similarly, we can use the\nINTEGRAL data to estimate the chance of a random coincidence\nwith a comparably bright source in the region of NGC 5204\ncontaining the counterpart, which gives a probability P < 0:08. It\nis very likely then that the optical counterpart is indeed associated\nwith the X-ray source.\nIn Fig. 4 we present the INTEGRAL optical spectrum of the\nsource. The source has a very obvious blue continuum spectrum,\nwith little evidence for emission lines (indeed, the shallow\nemission lines present such as Ha are likely to be due to the small\namounts of ionized gas seen in the environment of NGC 5204 X-1\nin Fig. 3). Note that the presence of strong sky lines and low signal-\nto-noise ratio made the background subtraction and flat-fielding\nparticularly difficult at either end of the wavelength range, but\ndespite this the spectrum is essentially featureless. We discuss the\nimplications of this in detail in the next section.\nA second interesting feature of Fig. 3 is an apparent \u2018hole\u2019 in the\nionized gas, seen predominantly to the east of NGC 5204 X-1 in\nthe [S II], Ha and [O III] images, and also observed to extend to the\nwest in the Hb image. The continuum images show no obvious\nsign of this being due to absorption, for example in a dust lane. It is\nat least plausible therefore that this is a cavity in the interstellar\nmedium of NGC 5204, apparently centred on the position of the\nX-ray source, with a diameter of ,100\u2013200 pc.\n4 T H E N AT U R E O F T H E B E A S T\n4.1 A foreground or background source?\nIn the previous section we showed that the optical counterpart is\nvery likely to be associated with the X-ray source. However, in the\nabsence of strong features in the optical spectrum, we cannot\nconfirm that the counterpart is associated with NGC 5204. This\nmeans that we must consider the merits of known classes of\nfeatureless blue continuum foreground and background sources as\npotential identifications.\nA possible foreground identification, based on the very blue\noptical spectrum, would be an isolated white dwarf in our galaxy.\nHowever, the X-ray properties are not consistent with such a white\ndwarf, which would typically only display X-ray emission at\nenergies up to a few hundred eV as opposed to the several keV\nobserved (e.g. Marsh et al. 1997).\nIn terms of a background object, the best candidate would appear\nto be a BL Lac object. The featureless blue optical and X-ray\ncontinua, its point-like nature in both X-rays and optical, and the\nlong-term X-ray variability are all consistent with the known\nproperties of BL Lacs. In order to investigate this possibility\nfurther, given that BL Lac objects are radio-loud active galactic\nnuclei (AGN), we searched the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS:\nCondon et al. 1998) for a point-like radio continuum source at the\nposition of NGC 5204 X-1. No source is found at the position of\nNGC 5204 X-1; however, an NVSS source of strength 16.3 mJy is\npresent 26 ^ 14 arcsec to its south-west. The difference in\npositions implies that the NVSS source is unlikely to be a radio\ncounterpart to NGC 5204 X-1 [the astrometry of the survey is good\nto ,1 arcsec compared with US Naval Observatory A1.0 catalogue\n(USNO) optical positions]; however, this cannot be ruled out given\nthat the spatial resolution of the survey is only 45 arcsec. In fact, we\nnote that another candidate exists that may be the source of the\nradio continuum emission, namely a supernova remnant detected\nby Matonick & Fesen (1997), NGC 5204 #3, at a distance of\n20 ^ 12 arcsec from the NVSS detection. At the very least, the\npresence of the radio source may limit the sensitivity with which\nwe can claim a non-detection at the position of NGC 5204 X-1,\nabove the typical survey limit of ,2.5 mJy.\nTo ascertain whether NGC 5204 X-1 is actually a BL Lac, we\nderived aro and aox values as per Laurent-Muehleisen et al. (1999),\nfor the cases in which the NVSS source is\/is not the counterpart. If\nit is, then aro \u0088 0:49 and aox \u0088 1:1, which by fig. 3 of Laurent-\nMuehleisen et al. (1999) places NGC 5204 X-1 firmly in the\nparameter space occupied by BL Lac objects. If the NVSS source\nis not a counterpart, and we assume an upper limit of 2.5 mJy for\nthe NVSS source flux, then we get aro # 0:33 which implies that\nthe source has at best a low aro value for a BL Lac. A further\ntightening of the constraints on radio continuum emission by a\nfactor of a few would clearly put NGC 5204 X-1 outside the\nparameter space occupied by BL Lac objects, and so a high-\nresolution radio continuum follow-up of this source is essential.\n4.2 NGC 5204 X-1 as an SES\nA further possibility for the origin of the blue continuum optical\nspectrum is the emission from one or more O stars.3 The observed\nFigure 4.

P. Roberts et al.\nq 2001 RAS, MNRAS 325, L7\u2013L11\n at Leicester U\nniversity Library on A\nugust 8, 2013\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nmagnitude \u0085mv \u0088 19:7\u0086 is far too faint for a Galactic O star.\nInstead, if the emission comes from a source in NGC 5204, then its\nabsolute magnitude is Mv \u0088 28:7 (for a distance of 4.8 Mpc); this\ncorresponds to the emission of ,8\u201320 \u2018typical\u2019 supergiant\/giant O\nstars (Zombeck 1990) within a ,12-pc region in NGC 5204.\nAlthough it seems unlikely that such a compact cluster of O stars\nmay exist in apparent isolation in the galaxy, it is possible that\nwe may be observing one or more unusually luminous O stars.\nIf the optical counterpart is indeed stellar, then this would\nappear to confirm that the X-ray emission is originating in a binary\nsystem.\nRecent theoretical work (King et al. 2001) has discussed the\nlikely physical nature of the ULXs that constitute the accreting\nsubset of SES. They come to the conclusion that, whilst accretion\non to an intermediate-mass \u0085102\u2013104 M(\u0086 black hole cannot be\nruled out in individual cases, the majority of ULXs may represent a\nshort-lived but extremely common stage in the evolution of many\nX-ray binaries, in which the X-ray emission is mildly beamed. The\nbest candidate for this epoch is a period of thermal-time-scale mass\ntransfer in intermediate- and high-mass X-ray binaries. The short\nlifetimes of high-mass X-ray binaries and their association with\nstar formation explain the unusually high numbers of these objects\npresent in very actively star-forming galaxies (e.g. \u2018The Antennae\u2019:\nFabbiano, Zezas & Murray 2001). This explanation is fully\nconsistent with our observation of an O-star companion to the\naccreting source, and may, if the mass transfer is occurring as a\nresult of the O star filling its Roche lobe as it crosses the\nHertzsprung gap, also explain in part the unusual optical\nluminosity of the O star.\nOne final point to consider is the possible cavity in the\ninterstellar medium of NGC 5204 identified in the INTEGRAL\nemission-line images. If this is a true cavity centred on NGC 5204\nX-1 then it is very plausible that NGC 5204 X-1 may be in some\nway responsible for this, possibly because of the stellar wind from\nthe O star (and its companions), or the progenitor supernova of the\ncompact source. In either case, the presence of such a cavity is\nfurther evidence that NGC 5204 X-1 lies within the confines of the\nhost galaxy.\n5 C O N C L U S I O N S\nWe have used new Chandra ACIS-S X-ray data and William\nHerschel Telescope\/INTEGRAL field spectroscopy to study the\nX-ray emission from the suspected SES NGC 5204 X-1, and have\nidentified a possible counterpart with a blue continuum optical\nspectrum. Although we cannot completely rule out the scenario in\nwhich we are observing a BL Lac object behind NGC 5204, the\nobservational evidence is consistent with the scenario in which we\nare viewing the beamed emission of a high-mass X-ray binary,\ncontaining either a black hole or a neutron star with an O-star\ncompanion, in a period of high mass transfer.\nAC K N OW L E D G M E N T S\nWe thank the INTEGRAL team for permitting us access to\nunreleased reduction software.
