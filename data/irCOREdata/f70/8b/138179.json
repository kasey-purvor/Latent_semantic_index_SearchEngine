Introduction \nThe ability of semi-conducting materials to engage in photochemical reactions is well known \n\u2013 the evolution of electron\/hole pairs through sufficiently high energy irradiation allows both \nreduction and oxidation to occur through the donation of the hole or electron. Recently it has \nbeen shown that it is possible to treat ferroelectric materials as wide band gap semi-\nconductors where both oxidation and reduction of materials has been demonstrated [1, 2] and \nthat the surface polarization can influence the absorption of large polar molecules. There are \ncertain advantages to using a ferroelectric material in photochemical reactions which stem \nfrom the spatial separation of the oxidation and reduction regions [3]. A further peculiarity \nstems from the spontaneous polarization of ferroelectrics. This leads to unique surface \nproperties where a polarization dependent surface charge develops [4]. There is now a \ngrowing body of literature which is showing that ferroelectric surfaces can be used to perform \n\u2018nanolithography\u2019 and be used for the directed growth of metal nanoparticles [5]. \nWhen the bulk of a ferroelectric is broken by an interface, such as at the surface or a grain \nboundary, a space charge region forms. In order to form an energetically stable state there are \ntwo possible screening processes; one internal, the other external to the material. The external \nprocess can be described as ions or polarizable molecules of opposite sign to the surface \ncharge adsorbing on the surface due to charge attraction. This is described by classic DLVO \ntheory and is the Stern layer associated with charged surfaces [1]. Internal screening takes the \nform of a space charge region. The polarization of the surface of the ferroelectric is dependent \non the orientation of the ferroelectric domain due to the dipole developed in the distorted \ncrystal lattice. \nIt has been stated that ferroelectrics such as lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) can be thought of as \nwide bandgap semiconductors [6] rather than pure insulators. It has been shown that an \nenergy of between 4.1eV [7] and 4.5eV [8] is required to generate silver nanoclusters on the \nsurface of PZT. The band gap for PZT has been variously shown to be in the region of 3.2 \u2013 \n3.7eV [9]. There is however one major addition that must be considered and that is domain \ndependent polarization effects. Band bending in ferroelectric materials such as PZT is \ndependent not only on the doping and composition of the material but also the polarization of \nthe ferroelectric domains, see Figure 1. Ferroelectric materials such as PZT have a \nmacroscopic polarization that induces space charge regions at the surfaces. In positive \ndomains, a positive charge is present at the surface of the material. An internal screening \nmechanism consisting of the formation of a space-charge region below the surface occurs. \nThis creates an internal electric field that bends the energy bands near the surface of the \nmaterial. In both types of domain, the polarization field is cancelled at equilibrium by the \nscreening mechanisms. \n \nFigure 1. Surface energy band bending due to ferroelectric Polarization of PZT. The right \ndomain has been positively poled, i.e. the positive end of the dipole is pointing towards the \nsurface. This causes the bands to bend downwards due to mobile electrons migrating to the \nsurface. The bands bend up if the domain is poled in the opposite direction, left image, and \nelectrons move towards the bulk leaving holes at the surface. \nWhen the ferroelectric is exposed to high energy ultraviolet light, electron-hole pairs are \nformed [10] and driven apart by the internal electric fields in the space charge region. The \nmobile electrons are forced to migrate towards the surface in positive domains [11] and \ntowards the bulk in negative domains. If the ferroelectric is immersed in a metal salt solution \nsuch as AgNO3 and exposed to ultraviolet light, the excited electrons at the surface can react \nwith the Ag+ cations in solution. The Ag+ ions are reduced to form metal atoms that are \nadsorbed on the ferroelectric surface. Giocondi et al [3] points out that the adsorption of the \nAg onto the surface cannot be ion polarization dependent as the Ag+ ions and the surface of \nthe ferroelectric  positive domain have the same polarity. This means that the ion should be \nrepelled if the process was polarity driven, the successful formation of the silver clusters \nsupports the theories of Zhu and Kalinin. These results are further supported by the work of \nDunn et al, who have shown that it is possible to selectively absorb biological molecules onto \nthe surface of a ferroelectric and that the screening layer at the surface influences the \ndeposition process [1]. \nPhoto-reduction studies on ferroelectric materials have to date focused on surfaces that have \nbeen largely free of defects, although Hanson et al [12] indicate that the surface of PZT is \nconsidered to be highly oxygen defected, this is a homogeneous defect that covers the whole \nsurface of the PZT and is as such not localised. The defects that have been present in the \nstudies in PZT have been in the form of native or \u2018written\u2019 domain boundaries [7]. In order to \ninvestigate the effects that different boundary conditions have on metal deposition, Ag was \ndeposited onto PZT thin films that have a highly heterogeneous surface using high energy UV \nirradiation.  \n2. Experimental Procedure \nThe samples of lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) used were 250nm thick thin films with the \ncomposition PbZr(0.3)Ti(0.7)O3 (PZT 30:70) grown on glass coated with indium tin oxide (ITO) \nelectrodes using a process described by Shaw et al [13] and Roy el al[14]. Two films were \nused, the structure of the first (annealed at 550\u00b0C for 20 minutes) consisted of a series of \ndisconnected perovskite rosettes embedded in a pyrochlore matrix \u2013 as determined by X-ray \ndiffraction (XRD) and Piezo Force Microscopy[15, 16] (PFM). The second sample (annealed \nat 570\u00b0C for 20 minutes) contained no pyrochlore phase and consisted of a series of \nconnected perovskite rosettes. The metal salt solution used was freshly made 0.01M AgNO3. \nWhen required, Tollens reagent was freshly prepared. \nA drop (approximately 25\u03bcl) of AgNO3(aq) was placed onto the PZT samples and exposed to \nUV radiation (Honle 400W Hg lamp, 200nm (6.2eV) - 340nm (3.6eV), 21mW at sample \nsurface). After exposure the samples were rinsed in deionized water and blown dry with dry \nair. Characterisation of samples was carried out using a Digital Instruments Dimension 3000 \nAtomic Force Microscope (AFM) in tapping mode. \n \n3. Results and Discussion \nAn examination of the PZT samples investigated showed that there were 4 types of boundary. \nTwo related to the physical structure of the film; interphase boundaries (IB) where the \nperovskite and pyrochlore phases meet and grain boundaries (GB) where the edges of the \nrosettes met each other. Two further boundaries were also identified, these were domain \nboundaries (DB) and surface state effects or domain polarization (DP). These boundaries are \nshown graphically in Figure 2.  \n \nFigure 2. Four types of boundary found on PZT samples used, A) interphase boundaries (IB) \nwhere the perovskite and pyrochlore phases meet , B) grain boundaries (GB) where the edges \nof the rosettes met , C) domain boundaries (DB) where polar domains meet, and D) surface \nstate effects and domain polarization (DP). \nAfter irradiating a PZT sample with the UV lamp tapping mode AFM images were taken. \nThis mode was used as the Ag clusters have a loose bond on the PZT surface, if contact mode \nwere used clusters would be displaced by the AFM tip. This means that PFM cannot be used \nafter metal deposition as it is a contact process. The resulting image, Figure 3 left, showed \nthat deposition of the silver had only occurred on the positive domains within the perovskite \narea of PZT. These results are predicted by previous work and follow band gap theory and \nbending of the bands due to space charge effects and resultant movement of electrons or holes \ntowards or away from the surface due to charge repulsion. There was no deposition of the \nmetal at the interphase boundaries or on the pyrochlore phase that is surrounding the \nperovskite rosette Figure 3 right. Figure 4 shows perovskite rosettes in a pyrochlore phase, it \ncan be seen that the pyrochlore does not contain any polar domains which are present in the \nrosettes. The lack of growth of silver metal on pyrochlore region supports the theory \npresented by Lee et al that the pyrochlore PZT has a larger bandgap than perovskite PZT [17]. \nThe energy requirements for the creation of an electron-hole pair over the pyrochlore region \ncould potentially be within the energy output of the UV bulb as this extends to 6.2eV. \nHowever, the AgNO3 solution starts to absorb radiation at ca 4.9eV, and is reducing the flux \nof photons by 90% at 5.8eV. Therefore the photoactivity of the pyrochlore surface could be \ninhibited through a lack of available photons. \n \n \nFigure 3. (Left) AFM topological image of PZT on ITO perovskite areas around grain \nboundaries after Ag deposition and (Middle) representative PFM, light regions are positive \ndomains and dark negative domains. (Right) Perovskite rosette surrounded by Pyrochlore \nphase. Ag has deposited preferentially at the grain boundaries (A) and (B) and then at the \ndomain boundaries (C). It can be seen in the right image that the Ag has not deposit on the \npyrochlore phase or phase boundaries.  \n \n \nFigure 4. Topological (Left) and PFM (Right) images of PZT perovskite rosettes in \npyrochlore phase. The rosettes show polar domains can be seen within the rosettes but not in \nthe pyrochlore.  \n  \nThe most rapid Ag deposition was seen at the grain boundaries between two rosettes and \nwhere there was a disturbance in the rosette structure as shown in Figure 5 left. Somewhat \nsurprisingly from theory of band bending and space charge accumulation the clusters of silver \nthat have grown in the interface region have also grown irrespective of the domain structure \nof the PZT in the region, Figure 5 right. The Ag clusters that have grown at the interface \nbetween the two rosettes are larger than those that have grown on the positive domains in the \nrosette structure. The average diameter of clusters at the rosette interface is ca 150nm where \nas elsewhere on the rosette it is ca 40nm. If the rosettes are assumed to be spherical then the \ninterface clusters are growing about 50 times faster than elsewhere. \n    \nFigure 5. AFM image (Left) of grain boundary between two connecting and PFM (Right) of \nsame area. The white areas are positive domains. In the AFM image it can be seen that there \nis a greater concentration of Ag clusters at the grain boundary than elsewhere in the rosette. \nBy comparing the AFM and PFM images it can seen that the deposition at the grain boundary \nis independent of domain polarization. \nThis increased rate of growth of silver clusters is due to a combination of band bending at the \nsurface of the two grains on either side of the boundary, and the internal electric field at the \nboundaries due to a lattice mismatch. This mismatch leads to a variation in free energy which \nin turn leads to an increase in depletion or accumulation of mobile charge carriers in the \nregion around the grain core [18], which causes further band bending. An additional effect of \nthe accumulation of charge carriers is an increase in the number of electrons that are available \nfor the reduction of the silver cations to generate silver nanoparticles. The greater availability \nof electrons at these boundaries due to domain polarization and interface effects can be seen \nby the increased rate of metal deposition.  \nWhere the core of the grain boundary is positively charged the outer boundary becomes \nfurther depleted of electrons and the depletion region forms with downward energy band \nbending. The depletion region has a space charge which is at its greatest at the grain boundary \ncore and reduces as it moves into the grains [19, 20]; a diagrammatic representation is shown \nin Figure 6. The space charge at the grain boundary caused by the atomic mismatch between \nthe rosette crystal interfaces causes those mobile electrons within the boundary depletion \nregion to migrate to the boundary and then to the surface, in effect the boundary is attracting \nelectrons from the region around it as shown in Figure 7. This effect must not be confused \nwith conduction as the electrons are not crossing the boundaries but migrating to either side \ndue to the space charge region existing in three dimensions and running down the interface. \nDue to mobility of electrons in the area surrounding the grain boundary more electrons will be \navailable at the boundary than the surrounding regions and thus Ag will deposit faster at these \npoints. For the sample shown in Figure 3 the diameter of a typical Ag cluster at the grain \nboundary is about 200nm whereas in the positive domain it has grown to about 60nm. If the \neffective diameter of an Ag atom is taken as 0.288nm and the clusters are deemed to be \npseudo hemi-spherical then the number of atoms can be calculated for each cluster. The \n200nm cluster is calculated to have ca 3x108 atoms and the 60nm cluster ca 8x106 atoms. As \neach Ag ion required one electron to reduce to a silver atom the ratio of electrons released \nbetween the two areas can be calculated. Therefore, the ratio of electron availability at the \ngrain boundaries release is ca 40:1 when compared to those available at the positive domains. \n Figure 6. Potential difference at grain boundary due to space charge region as a function of \ndistance from grain boundary core [19]. The electrons released in the space charge region due \nto UV irradiation migrate towards the grain boundary.  \n \n \nFigure 7. Flow of electrons in the PZT at grain boundaries during UV irradiation. Electron-\nhole pairs are generated in the film due to interactions with incoming photons. The electric \nfield caused by the downward band bending at the grain boundary causes electrons to migrate \nto it.  Due to this migration there is a larger population of available electrons for metal \nreduction at the grain boundaries than at the surface of the grain away from the boundaries. \nIt can be seen that the metal deposits along the boundary. If the depolarization field due to \npolar domains was involved in this process of grain boundary deposition there would be a \ndifference in deposition rate where a domain crosses a grain boundary and where it switches \nat the boundary. The depolarization field directs metal deposition at solution-surface \ninterfaces due to band bending. However, this result indicates that the effect of band bending \ndue to the polarization state of the ferroelectric is not as significant as impacts associated with \n\u2018standard\u2019 semi-conductor behaviour.  \nFrom the discussion so far it is possible to rank the interface influences with respect to metal \ndeposition rates, this is shown in Table 1. The greatest deposition rates are seen at grain \nboundaries and defects in the surface, as seen in figure 5. It is now possible to hypothesise \nthat the silver deposited on the surface grows as clusters and not a homogeneous film due to \nthe influence of nanoscopic surface defects or regions of unusual surface topography. These \nregions would have a larger availability of electrons due to the fields generated by the defects \naround the boundary core [21]. The second highest rate of deposition is found on surfaces \nwhere there is a positive domain below, as in figure 3 left. The deposition here is due to the \navailability of electrons after the formation of an electron-hole pair due to band bending. In \nother regions the electrons migrate into the body of the ferroelectric due to the internal field \nand so the probability of the reduction of the silver cation is reduced. This is demonstrated \nwith no discernable increased deposition at the interphase boundaries and domain boundaries, \nas seen in figure 3 right. \n Rank Boundary Type \n1 Grain boundaries \n2 Positive domains \n3 Interphase boundaries \n3 Domain boundaries \nTable 1. Rank of boundaries with respect to Ag metal deposition rates \nIn order to understand the mechanism that controls the final size of the Ag nanoparticles on \nthe surface of the PZT, a thin film of Ag was grown onto transparent quartz glass. The Ag \nwas deposited using Tollens reagent and reduced using glucose sugars. The transmission of \nphotons though the Ag film were measured using an Elmer-Perkin Lambda 7 \nphotospectrometer. It was found that 95% of photons above 4.5eV were blocked by the Ag \nfilm though it was only a few monolayers thick. An example of the transmittance spectra for \nUV through ca 2nm silver can be seen in Figure 8.  \n \nFigure 8. Transmittance spectra for UV through ca 2nm Ag film, up to 95% of the UV above \n4.5eV is blocked. There is a peak where 50% of the UV can pass though the Ag at 3.8eV, the \nloss of transmission below this peak is due to the plasmon response of the Ag which is at \nabout 3.1eV. The gray box Eact is the energy that is required to cause Ag deposition onto the \nsurface and Eg is the energy bandgap for PZT. \nThe spacing and size of the Ag clusters is determined by the free space around the initial \nnucleation points. As the clusters grow they shadow the substrate beneath from the UV \nradiation as shown in Figure 9, remember that clusters can grow to many tens of nanometres \nin diameter and thickness. Uncovered active regions undergo electron migration, due to the \nexcitation from the UV, to the surface and allow the clusters to continue to grow. As the \nedges of the clusters grow so the exposed surface area reduces as this is being shadowed from \nthe UV by the clusters. When the edges of the clusters meet the electron migration stops. The \nclusters grow in a pseudo semi-hemispherical manner as electrons are able to migrate through \nthe silver thereby generating negative charges on the surface of the silver as well as at the \nedges of the growing cluster. This migration of electrons is random in nature and so there is \nan equal chance of the cluster growing in the x, y and z directions. The growth of silver \nclusters on PZT is in contrast to the recent work published by Hanson et al [12] who show \nthat on lithium niobate discrete metal wires can be formed. The justification for the growth of \nthe wires solely along the domain boundary due to an inherent lack of defects in the surface of \nthe lithium niobate and increased electric field distribution over the domain boundary \nsupports the enhanced growth of silver nanoparticles at boundaries in PZT thin films. \nFurthermore, the increased defect density in the PZT will produce potential nucleation regions \non the surface of the PZT for the growth of the silver nanoparticles. These regions will spawn \nsilver nanoparticles that finally grow into the large clusters seen.  \n \nFigure 9. Ag cluster growth retardation mechanism. First the clusters nucleate and start to \ngrow as the electrons migrate to the surface due to UV irradiation. As the clusters grow they \nshadow the ferroelectric surface from the UV. When the cluster edges meet the ferroelectric \nwill no longer receive UV photons and the electron migration to the surface stops. \nOf further interest is the ability to release the silver nanoparticles from the surface of the \nferroelectric material. If the substrate with a surface covered in nanoparticles is immersed into \na 0.05M thioglycolic acid (TGA) solution and then placed in an ultrasonic bath after just two \nminutes of ultra-sonification there has been a significant reduction in the metal adhered onto \nthe substrate surface. Figure 10 shows the before and after image for the substrate after \nsonication.  \n \nFigure 10. Surface of PZT that has been irradiated to grow Ag clusters before and after the \nsubstrate has been sonicated in Thioglycolic acid (TGA). Most of the Ag has been removed \nafter about 2 minutes. \nA large number of metals have been grown using the method of UV illumination over \nferroelectric surfaces [22]. As it is possible to control the size of the nanoparticles by \ncontrolling the time of exposure to the UV light then this provides a potential new method for \nmaking nanoparticles.  \n \n4. Conclusion \nWe have shown that the preferential deposition of Ag on to the surfaces of PZT using \nultraviolet irradiation is dependent not only on ferroelectric polar domains but also the film \nstructure. We show that the deposition rate at grain boundaries and line defects in the film are \nmuch greater than that due to polar domains. It is a consequence of band bending at the grain \nboundaries due to atomic mismatch and the creation of a surface charge region that causes \nthese areas to have a greater deposition rate than elsewhere in the grain. The topology of the \ngrain boundary also has a great effect on where the metal will be on the film surface. The \neffects displayed make these samples unsuitable for use as templates in the creation of \ndefined shaped nanoparticles. The fact that there is an increased deposition at large grain \nboundaries means that it could find application in the removal of metal ions from water. We \nhave further shown that this method of growing metal nanoparticles on a substrate could be a \nnew method for the synthesis of metal nanoparticles that are to be placed in suspension. \n Acknowledgments \nThe authors wish to thank Dr Chris Shaw, and Dr Qi Zhang for providing the PZT samples, \nand Dr Diego Gallardo for his invaluable input.
