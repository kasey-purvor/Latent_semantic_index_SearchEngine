This is mostly due to the complexity of the phenomenon of time, which not only produces a number of paradoxes, but also spans the complete realm of the natural and social sciences. Moreover, time is often conceptualised in its common sense, Newtonian shape, thus ignoring major theoretical developments of the last 100 years.

Moreover, time is often conceptualised in its common sense, \nNewtonian shape, thus ignoring major theoretical developments of the last 100 \nyears. One philosopher who has attempted to address these shortcomings is A.N. \nWhitehead. The present contribution draws on his philosophy in order to develop \na theory of action based on a post-relativity concept of time. \n \n \n \n \n \nFrom Time to Action \n2 \nTime is and has been a recurrent problem for social theory, sociology, and \norganizational theory. Many authors, especially during the 1970s and 1980s, have \nattempted to address the phenomenon directly or incorporate it as an element into \ntheir theoretical schemes. Even so, Giddens\u2019s verdict (Giddens, 1987, 1991, \n1984\/1993) still holds true: Although time has been recognised as an important \nfactor, there is still no theoretical approach based on the intricacies of time. This \nlack seems less due to the inattention of researchers than to other factors inherent \nin the phenomenon of time.  \nFirst, there are the age-old aporias and paradoxes impeding any attempt at \ntheoretical penetration of the object. Second, time, with its dual nature, lies at the \nbasis of both social and natural sciences. However, instead of bridging the \nDiltheyan gap between the two traditions, the investigation of time has been torn \nbetween them, with social scientists mainly focussing on \u201csocial time\u201d and \nignoring the knowledge accumulated in the natural sciences or at least portraying \nit as something derivative from the \u201coriginal\u201d nature of time1\nDespite these two major obstacles, time is too important and ubiquitous to ignore. \nBiological rhythms, the allocation and use of time as a resource, the construction \nof time as a social marker, the importance of the past for collective and individual \nidentity construction, temporal features of social and system integration, to name \njust a few, are such fundamental features of life that almost no basic theory, \nwhether it concerns culture or nature, can be considered complete without a \nconcept of time or temporality.  \n. Natural scientists, \non the other hand, have always regarded culture as a derivative of nature and thus \ncommit the same error in the other direction. This is even more deplorable as the \ntwo major 20th century theoretical developments concerning time, viz. Einstein \nand Heidegger, have thus never come into contact. Moreover, the gap even seems \nto widen as the years go by: while attempts at fusing philosophic and natural \nknowledge on time still can be found among many prominent authors up to the \n1950s (e.g. Schr\u00f6dinger, 1944\/1993, Heisenberg, 1956\/1993), the camps today \nseem firmly entrenched in their respective traditions. Given the vastness of the \nknowledge accumulated on both sides during the last century alone, any attempt at \ncrossing the border seems destined to break on the cliffs of specialisation. \nThe present article will discuss the importance of time for an adequate \nconceptualisation of action and creativity. As a theoretical basis, it will use the \nFrom Time to Action \n3 \ntime conception and metaphysics of Alfred North Whitehead (1927\/1959, \n1933\/1967, 1929\/1985). Within the given scope, the analysis must, however, be \nregarded as a first sketch only, as both Whitehead\u2019s theory and developments in \nthe theory of action are too complex to be discussed exhaustively. What it can do \nis to introduce the major features and most promising focuses, and to invite others \nto think along the same lines in order to develop such an idea. \n \n1. What\u2019s Wrong with Newton \n \nFor almost 350 years, Newton\u2019s physics (Newton, 1687\/1993) have provided the \nbasic paradigm for scientific and lay time conception2. In this paradigm, time, \ntogether with space, is conceived as the \u201cplace\u201d where the movement or change of \nthings occurs. In itself, it is unchangeable, permanent, a background before which \neverything happens. Due to this function, it provides a solid grid for determining \nwhether an event A is earlier, later, or simultaneous with another event B. Time is \nalso uniform and homogeneous. It can be measured by dividing it into discrete, \nidentical and infinitely small fragments, and is, in its measurement, objective or \nindependent of the observer.  \nThis time conception has, for various reasons, been under attack ever since it was \npublished.  \nIt took, however, another 200 years to dethrone it as the reigning paradigm of \nphysics. Einstein\u2019s relativity theory (Einstein, 1917\/1993) not only revolutionised \nphysics, but also left a \u2013 however vague \u2013 impression in the understanding of lay \npeople that \u201ctime is relative\u201d. This notion refers to Einstein\u2019s thesis that time is \nneither unchangeable nor homogeneous, but depends on space, matter, and the \nreference system of the observer. Hence, it cannot order things or events \ntemporally in an unequivocal way. For example, two events may appear \nsimultaneous for one observer, but successive for another with a different \nreference system. \nBut even without \u2013 and long before \u2013 Einstein\u2019s physical and mathematical \ninsights, logicians have come to the conclusion that a logically sound conception \nof time can conceive it neither as homogeneous nor as indefinitely divisible nor, \nas some of Newton\u2019s contemporary critics (e.g. Leibniz, 1990) claimed, as a pure \nrelation between events. The battle on the logical front was already opened by the \nFrom Time to Action \n4 \nGreek natural philosopher Zeno, who, with his famous paradoxes, argued against \nthe assumption of time as a continuum and against time as made up of discrete, \ninfinitely small parts or mathematical points (R\u00f6d, 1976). It was later joined, with \nvarious conclusions, by Aristotle (1993) and St. Augustine (400\/1993), Kant \n(1781\/1989) and Leibniz (1703\/1971), or Husserl (1929\/1966) and McTaggart \n(1908\/1993), to name just a few of the most influential critics. I will follow \nHammerschmidt (1984) in his exposition of four basic logical inconsistencies.  \n1. Assumption: Time is a succession of infinitely small, discrete moments, which \nare themselves, like mathematical points, not extended. \nA serial succession of such moments is not possible as we could always conceive \nof an even smaller moment going in between the already conceived ones. This can \nbe compared to the attempt of counting from 1 to 10 using real instead of natural \nnumbers: not knowing the first (smallest) positive real number, one could not \neven get started. Mathematical points only make sense if taken as abstract figures, \nbut lead to paradoxes as soon as one takes them for real. The conclusion ex \nnegativo is that if time consists of units (moments), these must be extended. \n2. Assumption: Each moment is self-identical. \nAs we have seen, such a moment must be extended. In order to be extended, it \ncannot be self-identical as temporal extension implies a \u201cbefore\u201d and an \u201cafter\u201d. \nOn the other hand, something self-identical cannot be before or after itself, or, in \nother words, if A is A it cannot be later than A. The conclusion ex negativo is that \nmoments must be changing or in flux. \n3. Assumption: This flux within a moment is homogeneous (i.e. each part of it is \nlike the whole). \nIn a homogeneous extension, the only differentiating criterion is the length or \nduration of the extension. This length can be divided, and we get in principle the \nsame argument as in the first assumption: by dividing every part in two parts ad \ninfinitum, we cannot proceed from one to the next. The conclusion ex negativo is \nthat the flux must be heterogeneous. \n4. Assumption: Time is a pure relation of before and after. \nAgain, the divisibility argument leads to an invalid conclusion. Time could only \nbe a pure relation if it were an unextended point, which we have already excluded. \nThe conclusion ex negativo is that time may involve relations, but must also \nconsist of non-relational temporal entities. \nFrom Time to Action \n5 \n \n2. Whitehead\u2019s Proposal \n \nThe English mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead, a \ncontemporary of Einstein, addressed these logical paradoxes in a systematic way \ndeveloping a theory of time that was, in the course of time, to become the \ncornerstone of a complete metaphysical system. \nWhitehead\u2019s answer (Whitehead, 1933\/1967, 1929\/1985) consisted in \nconceptualising smallest, atomic units, which he called \u201cActual Occasions\u201d or \n\u201cActual Entities\u201d. These Actual Occasions only exist as long as they become, i.e. \nthey are to be conceived as a process. Once this process, which Whitehead called \n\u201cconcrescence\u201d, is finished, the Actual Occasions perish as Actual Occasions and \nbecome something else. The process of concrescence has several different \nsuccessive stages or phases (see figure 1). Although these phases succeed each \nother, they are not temporally ordered, but only in a before-after relation. This \nidea is not immediately intuitive, but may be compared to the succession of \nnatural numbers, which is also ordered, but not temporal3. In consequence, these \nActual Occasions fulfil the above demands for avoiding logical paradoxes, as they \nare non-temporal, extended, changing, heterogeneous, and not pure relations.  \n \nDepending on the complexity of the Actual Occasion, its concrescence consists of \none or more phases. Very simple Actual Occasions, like the ones making up \npurely material objects (e.g. stones), pass through the initial phase of \nconcrescence forming physical relations with other entities, i.e. being physically \naffected by them. However, even they then pass on to a supplementary phase \ninvolving conceptual feelings \u201chowever dim\u201d, as Whitehead cautions. More \ncomplex Actual Occasions master more supplemental phases which involve more \nintense conceptual and, in the last stage, intellectual activity. This existence of \nboth physical and conceptual feelings in every Actual Occasion is central to \nWhitehead\u2019s metaphysical system, as it establishes another sort of \u201cmatter\u201d than \n \nFrom Time to Action \n6 \nconceptual \nfeeling\nsimple \ncomparative \nfeeling or \nproposition\ncomplex \ncomparative \nfeeling or \nintellectual \nfeeling\nphysical \nfeeling\nreverse \nconceptual \nfeeling\nInitial Phase Supplemental Phases\ncontrast\ncontrast\n \nFIGURE 1: THE PROCESS OF CONCRESCENCE \n \n \nthe one we are familiar with. In fact, it is one of Whitehead\u2019s major points of \ncritique against classical physics that matter is not \u201csenseless, valueless, \npurposeless\u201d (Whitehead, 1925\/1993:143). For him, physical and conceptual \n(mental) feelings always go together forming two poles within every entity4. Each \npole may be of more or less importance to the respective Actual Occasion, but \nboth are always there. In essence, it is their integration, every time different due to \nantecedent Objective Data and a subjective component, which makes up \nconcrescence. Only with micro organisms of such kind does it make sense to \nspeak of concepts like creativity and process, which by definition demand that \nparticles be \u201cnew\u201d in the sense of different from each other. \nOnce the concrescence of an Actual Occasion is finished, or \u201csatisfied\u201d as \nWhitehead says, it ceases to be an Actual Occasion and becomes an \u201cObjective \nDatum\u201d. This Objective Datum in some respects resembles a classical substance; \nmost important in the fact that it is. Several things may happen to it, it may form a \npart of a larger entity, but it remains the same particle throughout. Thus, in the \nFrom Time to Action \n7 \ninstant of satisfaction, we cross the border between becoming and being in the full \nAristotelian sense, which means that from now on the Aristotelian categories \n(quantity, quality, time, place, etc) apply. The Objective Datum now becomes \navailable for the concrescence of other Actual Occasions (see figure 2). This \nforms the basis of Whitehead\u2019s second major notion, viz. that everything is related \nto everything. During its concrescence, an Actual Occasion builds up a relation to \nevery Objective Datum in its world.  \nThis relation may be positive, which means that the respective Objective Datum \nhas an effect on the Actual Occasion, or negative, which means that it is \u201crefused\u201d \nby the Actual Occasion or does not play a role in its concrescence. In this way, \nthere is a progressive, albeit not necessarily linear, succession of Actual \nOccasions, each taking up the antecedent Actual Occasions in its concrescence \nand lending itself after its satisfaction to the Actual Occasions succeeding it. It is \nonly this succession of Actual Occasions that makes up time as we know it.  \nIt is quite obvious that Whitehead\u2019s account differs from many, if not most, \nprominent theories of time, mainly because of the assumption of non-temporal \nunits at the basis of time. However, I see his major strength not in the simple \ndifference, but in the capacity for integrating hitherto opposed concepts. This \nstrength is due to his attention on the relation between being and becoming, and \npermits the combination of substance-based theories of time (like Aristotle\u2019s) and \nprocess-based theories of time (like Bergson\u2019s), thus reconciling our common \nsense notions about time with the intricacies of a theoretical understanding of \ntime. Thus, on the \u201cmicro level\u201d of concrescence, we find processes, permanent \nchange, and relations, while on the \u201cmacro level\u201d of Objective Data, we get \nenduring entities describable in everyday terms. What is more, the shift from one \nlevel to the other can be explained in terms of the object, not only in terms of an \nobserver decision not motivated by the object itself. \nFrom Time to Action \n8 \n \n \nFIGURE 2: OBJECTIVE DATA (OD) AND ACTUAL OCCASIONS (AO) \n \n \n3. Application to Action Theory \n \nProblems of Action Theory \n \nThe scope of contributions in social theory, sociology and organization theory \ndealing with action or agency is, of course, immense. In the post-war period \nalone, we have the seminal contributions of Parsons (Parsons et al., 1951), \nGoffman (1959\/1976), Garfinkel (1986), and Habermas (1981\/1988) along with \nvery lively discussions in Analytical Philosophy, especially in the 1960s and \n1970s (among many others, Anscombe, 1958\/1977, Davidson, 1963, von Wright, \n1971\/1974). These analyses and discussions have, of course, produced a number \nof results, but repeatedly scholars of action theory have also complained that a \nnumber of issues still remain unaddressed. I will focus on the following, which I \nconsider of importance not only for a theory of action, but also for any social \nanalysis:  \nOD \nOD \nOD \nAO \nAO \npositive relation \nnegative relation \nFrom Time to Action \n9 \n\u2022 Creativity (also novelty, chance, emergence): Although one of the most \ncharacteristic features of action is its creative power, action theory has been \nhard pressed to conceptualise it adequately (see, for example, Archer, 1995, \nDrazin et al., 1999, Joas, 1992\/1996, Sibeon, 1999, Elchardus, 1988). The \nfuture, inherent in plans and projections as well as consequences of action, is \nsimply neither predictable nor fixed in any other way that could be expressed \nin a priori terms. Many authors, like Parsons, have collapsed the notion into \nsubjectivity implying that this theoretical shortcoming is intrinsically linked \nwith human freedom of decision-making. Others, like Joas (1992\/1996), have \ntaken refuge to weaker forms of analysis, viz. pure description (in his case \nthrough metaphors). Still others, like Bergson (1907\/1911), have concluded \nthat scientific analysis and theory is no valid instrument at all to get an insight \ninto creative processes. \n\u2022 Causality: Any science which aims at explanation must take note of causal \nrelations and dependencies. It would, however, be reductionist if action theory \nfrom the beginning only considered causality in terms of a causa efficiens, as \naction, especially in its human shape, is generally considered to contain a \nstrong measure of intentionality and thus finality. However, intention and \nfinality \u2013 or their more recent expression, sense-making \u2013 have been \nconsidered by many,  to be \u201cweaker\u201d forms of connecting events than causa \nefficiens versions, mainly due to the deterministic and mechanistic simplicity \nof the latter. From this, some authors (e.g. Davidson, 1963, Hempel, 1942) \nhave drawn the conclusion that finality is to be subsumed under efficient \ncausality, while others (e.g. Anscombe, 1958\/1977, Kenny, 1963\/1977, \nMelden, 1961\/1977) argue for a separation, even up to disciplinary closure, as \nsuggested by Dilthey. \n\u2022 Emotion: For reasons probably deeply hidden at the roots of scientific \ntraditions, emotions have not been a very popular subject in sociology and \norganisation theory5 (Cohen, 1997, van Buskirk and McGrath, 1992, \nEmirbayer and Goodwin, 1996). Like with creativity, emotions have mostly \nbeen subsumed under the catchword \u201csubjectivity\u201d, or been rationalised by \nclassifications. Again, raw, individual emotion seems hard to capture in the \nlanguage and arguments of science in general, but on the other hand, most \nFrom Time to Action \n10 \npeople will agree that emotions play an important role inciting and influencing \nthe course of action. \n\u2022 Link to society: Finally, there is the \u201cmissing link\u201d between action theory and \ntheories of society, which, under the different labels of \u201cmicro vs. macro\u201d, \n\u201cstructure vs. agency\u201d, \u201csubjective vs. objective\u201d or \u201cindividual vs. society\u201d, is \nprobably one of the most discussed issues in social theory during the last two \ndecades. While some scholars (Archer, 1995, Reed, 1988) advocate a clear \nanalytical separation, or dualism, between the two, others (Giddens, \n1984\/1993, Bourdieu, 1980\/1987, Habermas, 1981\/1988) try to overcome the \ngap conceptually. Still others, mostly in the empirical branches of research, \nsimply ignore the whole debate. Of those trying to link the two, the most \nprominent attempts (Parsons, Habermas, Giddens) argue for a shift in the level \nof observation6, i.e. in oscillating between the two positions. \n \nWhitehead and Action Theory \n \nAs we have seen, Whitehead\u2019s theory could be used to introduce time \u2013 moreover \na modern, post-relativity conception of time - to the core of social theory. \nWhitehead himself, of course, was no social scientist, and thus his theory would \nhave to be modified in order to address the specific problems of action theory I \nnamed above. \n \nBECOMING BEING \nActual Occasions Objective Data \nConcrescence Subject to Change \nAtemporal Temporal \nHeterogeneous Describable in Aristotelian Categories \nProcess Enduring Entity in Process \nCreativity Stability \nSubjective Aim Causal Efficacy \nPresent Past \nTABLE 1: BECOMING AND BEING \n \nFrom Time to Action \n11 \nI propose to use Whitehead\u2019s dual conception of becoming and being (see table 1) \nas starting point for reconceptualising the notion of action. On the left side of the \nnew table 2, we get a flow of action or activity like the ones envisaged by Giddens \n(1984\/1993), Sch\u00fctz (1962\/1973) or Weick (1969), on the right side we get \ndeterminate acts or units of action. The flow could be considered a permanent, \ncreative process, which \u201cproduces\u201d, among other things, time from non-temporal \noccasions. The individual occasions are linked with each other, thus forming \nlinear sequences or broader strands discernible as persons, societies, etc. (see \nfigure 3). The flow of action is an ongoing process that constitutes the present. \nWith regard to relativity theory, this means that it is free of causal influences \nexcept the ones lying in its past7. While it exists, it takes up these causal \ninfluences and orders them in a specific and novel (subjective) way according to \nits own necessities or telos. In this manner, the past can be said to live on in the \npresent, albeit in a modified way. This freedom from present causal influences \nalso explains why we cannot analyse this flow of action in the \u201cnormal\u201d way, for \nit is physically impossible to receive information from an event happening \nsimultaneously to the observer. Only past events can be perceived and processed; \nhence we can only analyse the Objective Data as the Actual Occasions have \nalready perished or been transformed. These Objective Data, in the form of acts, \nnow have determinate features because they are fixed and completed. They can be \ndescribed in the Aristotelian categories of being, including classical notions of \ntime, space, change and causality. If we view the analysis in terms of \nretrospection, it moreover becomes clear why action is so closely connected with \ndescription, a feature often remarked upon in Analytical Philosophy (Anscombe, \n1957\/1985, Beckermann, 1979, Tuomela and Miller, 1985). \nFor the aspects mentioned in the preceding section, this proposal offers some \nvaluable insights. \nThe freedom or creativity of the process rests on three postulates. First, \nWhitehead assumes an ongoing creativity of the universe, which accounts for the \nsimple fact that the world is ever changing. The second postulate, from the theory \nof relativity, is that simultaneous events are causally independent. Each Actual \nOccasion thus takes up past data, but develops independently of other \ncontemporary Actual Occasions. This, as Whitehead says, is the ultimate cause of \nfreedom of action. The third postulate concerns the subjective aim of every Actual \nFrom Time to Action \n12 \nOccasion, which decides how Actual Occasions from the past enter each \nrespective concrescence. However, the term \u201csubjective aim\u201d at first sight implies \nmore sophistication than Whitehead is inclined to concede to most Actual \nOccasions, and perhaps Heidegger\u2019s (1927\/1977) \u201cattunement\u201d (Gestimmtheit) or \neven the chemical notion of affinity would describe the idea better. Except for the \nvery few Actual Occasions that involve consciousness or mind, this subjective \naim has nothing to do with intention, personality, or any other term referring to \nthe specifics of human decision-making. Every electron, every protozoon, has its \nsubjective aim, which describes the individual reaction to an individual situation. \nNothing in the universe is ever exactly the same, but as the subjective aim of, say, \na stone, due to its evolutionary stage, can be considered quite undeveloped, its \nreaction to a certain situation is quite uniform and (for us) predictable. The degree \nof freedom thus increases with the complexity of the Actual Occasions from \nstrong conformity with natural laws to the imponderabilities of human decision-\nmaking.  \nWith the help of this subjective aim, we are also able to anchor both finality and \nefficient causality at the base of action. Whitehead conceptualises the ingression \nof a past Actual Occasion (now an Objective Datum) in the initial phase of a \nconcrescence as an example of efficient causality. In traditional terms, we could \nsay that the Objective Datum \u201caffects\u201d the concrescing Actual Occasion, in the \nway a ray of light, for example, physically affects the retina of the eye. In the \nfollowing stages of concrescence, however, the subjective aim of the Actual \nOccasion \u201cdecides\u201d (to a greater or lesser degree, as we have seen) whether or not \nto take this objective datum into account and make it part of its concrescence. \n \nFrom Time to Action \n13 \n \nBECOMING FLOW OF \nACTION \nBEING ACT \nActual Occasions Smallest instant of \nactivity or \nperception \nObjective Data Traditional Unit of \nAction \nConcrescence Activity of \nunifying multiple \nsubjective and \nobjective inputs  \nSubject to Change Succession of \nUnified Acts \nAtemporal Similarities with \nBergson\u2019s dur\u00e9e or \nHusserl\u2019s flow of \nconsciousness \nTemporal Follows \n(relativistic) \nphysical theory of \ntime \nHeterogeneous Consists of \ndifferent \nincomplete stages, \nwhich reach \ncompletion only \nthrough integration \nin the whole \nDescribable in \nAristotelian \nCategories \nHas duration, fixed \nposition in time \n(and space) \nProcess Ongoing Process Enduring Entity \nin Process \nFinite Beginning \nand End \nCreativity Creativity, Novelty Stability In Past \uf0e8 \nDetermined \nFeatures \nSubjective Aim Emotion, Finality; \nSubjectivity \nCausal Efficacy Causal Efficacy, \nObjectivity \nPresent Not empirically \nanalyzable, but has \nlogical structure \nPast Retrospective \nAnalysis \n \nTABLE 2: APPLICATION TO ACTION THEORY \n \n \nThus every transition from past to present involves both finality and efficient \ncausality. Moreover, Whitehead\u2019s conception also takes the transition from \npresent to future into account as the end (or telos or future) of every concrescence \nlies in becoming an Objective Datum, i.e. a causally efficient past for the next \nActual Occasion. Whitehead (1933\/1967:191ff.) describes this move as a \n\u201cpassage from reenaction to anticipation\u201d, with the addition of novel (subjective) \ncontent in between. \nEmotion, although in a very basic sense, is also at the basis of this process. \nWhitehead\u2019s term for the refusal or acceptance of the different Objective Data by \nFrom Time to Action \n14 \nan Actual Occasion is \u201cfeeling\u201d, and again we may be more at ease with \nattunement. Still, the notion of an individual, situative, in its specific \ncharacteristics non-repeatable, decisive influence remains the same. In the case of \nhighly developed, complex Actual Occasions the image is even easier to envisage \nthan in the case of physical objects as it quite closely resembles the common sense \nnotion of emotion8. Hence, quite in the Heideggerian sense, this emotion is the \ncondition for any \u201cbeing-in-the-world\u201d as it enables an exchange with other \nentities while at the same time preserving some amount of individuality. It is thus \nnot subjective in the objectivist sense, but rather a presupposition of any \nsubjectivity or objectivity. As Whitehead (1929\/1985:155) himself sketches one \nbasic tenet of his philosophy of organism: \u201cThe philosophies of substance \npresuppose a subject which then encounters a datum [\u2026]. The philosophy of \norganism presupposes a datum which is met with feelings, and progressively \nattains the unity of a subject.\u201d In consequence, people not so much have feelings, \nbut are outcomes of feelings and thus of their relations to other people and \nobjects. This translates into an action theory in which there can be neither major \ndivisive lines between rational and non-rational (emotional) forms of action nor a \nself-contained, purposive actor at its beginning.  \nFinally, the link to society or macrosocial theory is far more easily forged for this \nconcept of action as action is not conceived as the individual-intentional \nphenomenon of classic action theory. In his critique of the 17th century concept of \nmatter, most prominently advocated by Descartes (see below and endnote 9), \nWhitehead also attacks the basic assumption underlying the well-known \ndichotomies, viz. the distinction between mind and matter or subject and object \n(for a more detailed discussion see Habermas, 1981\/1988, Kaulbach, 1968). \nHence, it is not the question if and how action is caused by structure or vice versa, \nbut both emanate from the same source, viz. Actual Occasions. In consequence, \nthey differ in degree or complexity, but not categorically. Being related to one \nanother, Objective Data may form larger entities in the way atoms form material \nbodies. (Whitehead calls these entities \u201cnexus\u201d.) These nexus may consist of a \nlinear chain of Objective Data, with one succeeding the other, or may extend in \nboth time and space (see figure 3 for a simple illustration of each). Whitehead \ncalls the former way of organization a \u201cpersonal order\u201d (or \u201cperson\u201d), the latter a \n\u201csociety\u201d. \nFrom Time to Action \n15 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFIGURE 3: PERSONS AND SOCIETIES1\n \n \nIn consequence, we could claim with Whitehead that both individuals and \nsocieties \u201cconsist\u201d of a flow of activity, which can retrospectively be analysed as \ndifferent figurations of this flow \u2013 an idea reminiscent of Elias\u2019s figuration theory, \nalthough he does not pursue the idea on a philosophical level. Conceptualised in \nthis way, a shift in the level of observation, as demanded by the authors named \nabove, is no longer a jump over an analytical gap but remains in the same \ntheoretical category. \n \n4. Problems Concerning Whitehead \n \nWhitehead\u2019s philosophy is, of course, not without its problems. First and \nforemost, these problems are connected with the language he uses in order to \ndescribe his novel, and in some respects unusual, ideas. Talk of small particles \n\u201cfeeling\u201d others or having a \u201csubjective aim\u201d alienate many scholars because of \nthe implied \u201cpanpsychism\u201d (Emmet, 1984) or at least \u201cprotopsychism\u201d (Rensch, \n1984). No doubt, Whitehead\u2019s philosophy is based on the idea that mind, however \n                                                 \n1 For reasons of simplicity, space is represented as two-dimensional. \nTime \nSp\nac\ne \nTime \nSp\nac\ne \nSociety Person \nFrom Time to Action \n16 \ndim, and matter are inseparable even in organisms of the smallest scale. On the \nother hand, this is a direct consequence of his refusal to accept matter as \nconceived by 17th century scholars9 (Leclerc, 1984); a refusal which is \ntheoretically so well founded that most contemporary scholars would find it hard \nto disagree. Hence the problem lies less with Whitehead than with us: although we \nmay see that the old concept is untenable, we are so deeply embedded in its \ntradition that his \u2013 or, for that matter, any \u2013 alternative seems alien to us. Our \neveryday knowledge of relativity theory and quantum mechanics has remained on \na cognitive-abstract level, but has not (yet) entered the realm of intuition, where \nNewton still reigns. Still, if we agree that matter in its \u201csoulless\u201d form as usually \ndefined is not the source of being and reality, some thing(s) else must take its \nplace, however unfamiliar they may be. Indeed, to my opinion, Whitehead\u2019s \nproposals are still modest, especially if they are reformulated in a language more \nacceptable to a reader 80 years later. If we, as I suggested, for example use \n\u201caffinity\u201d instead of \u201cfeeling\u201d, the idea itself remains unchanged, yet the word \nsounds more suitable for contemporary ears. The task of reformulating Whitehead \nin this way has not been completed yet, indeed has hardly even started in earnest. \nNevertheless, I am convinced that scholars undertaking this task will not \nencounter major obstacles, as Whitehead\u2019s primary field of experience and \nscholarship are exactly not the social sciences, but \u201csoulless\u201d mathematics and \nphysics. His use of psychological or sociological terms like \u201csociety\u201d, \u201cperson\u201d \netc. retains the aim of describing physical phenomena and has thus a strong \naffinity to metaphor. Moreover, he capitalises on the fact that the natural sciences, \ntoo, lack precision in defining their basic concepts like energy or force. Hence, \nthis import of socio-psychological terms is not Social Darwinism in reverse, but \nthe attempt to (re-)define notions that, according to Whitehead, lie at the basis of \nboth the natural and the social sciences. The fact that the vocabulary tends more to \nthe social side may simply be due to the neglect of any sort of psychic description \non part of the natural sciences10.  \nA second task that will go with the first if Whitehead is to be taken seriously in \nthe social sciences, is the linking of his ideas with traditional and contemporary \nschools of, for example, sociology. Again, his provenience from another \ndiscipline has mostly prevented him from recognising and elaborating on notions \nsimilar to his own. Still, such a synopsis could be helpful in anchoring \nFrom Time to Action \n17 \nWhitehead\u2019s ideas more deeply in the social sciences. Two anchors which spring \nto mind immediately are his close connections with the Pragmatist tradition11 and \nParsons\u2019 (Alexander, 1983, Parsons, 1937\/1968) methodological use of \nWhitehead. \nAn even more serious concern, finally, lies in the epistemology Whitehead uses to \navoid the dichotomy between mind and matter or subject and object. Basically, he \nrefuses to accept Kant\u2019s (1781\/1989) distinction between object-as-perceived and \nobject-for-itself (Ding an sich), which is, again, a notion that has become most \nfamiliar to us12. Due to this, some critics (Felt, 1984) have accused him of \u201cna\u00efve \nrealism\u201d, i.e. of the error of uncritically taking everything for real the human \nsenses perceive. In fact, Whitehead denies a categorical distinction between the \nphysical world and human (or any other) perception. His reason, shared by \npragmatists, is that the latter has evolved out of the former and must thus \nsomehow conform to it. Despite this basic assumption however, his idea of \nperception is far from na\u00efve, but on the contrary analyses the process of \nperception in subtle detail (Molina, 1971). Whitehead, in critique of Hume and \nKant, even introduces an additional mode of perception called \u201ccausal efficacy\u201d13, \nwhich is supposed to provide a vague, but emotionally charged experience of the \nimmediate past in the environment of an organism (remember that, according to \nrelativity theory, we cannot perceive the present). From the point of view of \naction theory, this linking of perception and causality addresses two very \nimportant strands of argument: the first is the mind-body problem, which plays a \nprominent role in any theory of action (Barasch, 1993, Beckermann, 1977, Harr\u00e9, \n1979\/1993, Rensch, 1984, Gare, 2002), the second concerns the definition of \nagency as causal power (Emirbayer and Mische, 1998). Again, systematic \ndifferences notwithstanding, we may find close ties between Whitehead\u2019s thinking \nand phenomenological philosophy, especially that of Merleau-Ponty (Colapietro, \n1992, Doud, 1977, Hamrick, 1974, Cooper, 1993). However, as this article is \nconcerned with time, these connections can only be hinted at. \n \nFrom Time to Action \n18 \n5. Conclusion and Outlook \n \nThe utilisation of the difference between being and becoming, temporality and \natemporality for action theory promises a more adequate conceptualisation of \naction. It moves beyond classic efforts to identify stable dimensions of action by \nproviding a processual venue that seems more apt to capture the subjective, \nemotional and creative aspects of action. At the same time, it is able to integrate \ninsights of classic action theory by taking into account the perspective of \n\u201csubstance\u201d or \u201cbeing\u201d, on which classic theory is founded. Moreover, \nWhitehead\u2019s epistemology sheds new light on the structure-agency problem by \nproviding a metaphysical link between micro and macro entities. His account of \ntime is not only logically sound, but enables a post-relativist concept of time to \nenter sociological theory. This, in turn, not only changes the way we look at the \ncausality of action, but also disposes of the \u201ccontainer image\u201d of time. If time is \nnot some unchangeable grid in which events happen but emanates from process \nitself, then we may be able to study not only change in time, but also change as \nontologically prior to time \u2013 which would bring a new and  truly processual \nperspective to one of the most widely discussed topics within the social sciences. \nAt the exploratory stage of the present study, however, the full consequences \u2013 \nboth positive and negative - of this utilisation are not yet fully understood. On the \n\u201cexegetical front\u201d, Whitehead\u2019s concepts need elaboration concerning issues \ncentral to (social) action, social structure, and society. Problems inherent in his \ntheoretical scheme must be discussed, again not only on the philosophical level, \nbut with regard to ontological and epistemological concerns of the social sciences. \nOn the \u201csociological front\u201d, the viability of the being-becoming differentiation \nmust be further tested and discussed. This, however, cannot be a task for a single \nresearcher, but requires a lot of input from different sources and theoretical \nbackgrounds. Hopefully, the present article can provide a point of departure for \nsuch a discussion. \nFrom Time to Action \n19 \nNotes\n \n1 There are, of course, exceptions to this general trend, for example Adam (1988). \n2 Nobody familiar with the history of science will be surprised to hear that Newton\u2019s (1993) \nconception differed in important aspects (for example, a differentiation between mathematical and \nempirical time) from \u201eNewton\u2019s conception\u201c anno 2003 (Weik, 1998). This is, however, of minor \nimportance for the argument of this article. \n3 In the theory of time, McTaggart (1908\/1993) has introduced a similar notion with his A- and B-\nseries. In fact, the interpretation of Whitehead\u2019s ideas concerning this point has been one of major \ndifficulty and discussion among Whitehead scholars; cf. the exchange between Rosenthal (1996, \n1997) and Ford (1997) as well as the very clearly structured account of van Haeften (2001). \n4 Hendrichs (1984) interprets this within the frame of biological evolution by assuming a \u201cproto-\nconsciousness\u201d in dead matter, which may account for the development of mental faculties in \nhigher stages of the evolution.  \n5 Except, of course (!), in gender studies \n6 See (Parsons, 1937\/1968, Parsons et al., 1951), Giddens\u2019s \u201cbracketing\u201d (Giddens, 1984\/1993). \nEven Habermas, who states the problem most clearly, can avoid the shift only in his ideal type \nconception of \u201ccommunicative action\u201d, but not for other forms of action (Habermas, \n1981\/1988:152ff.).  \n7 The theory of relativity defines an event\u2019s past as the set of those events that could have causally \ninfluenced the event. As the influence is based on a transmission of information, and as \ninformation cannot travel faster than light, the consequence is that the past (relative to an event) is \ndetermined by the distance of the events. In especial, it is not possible to exchange information \nbetween two simultaneous events; which implies that they are always causally unrelated. (From \nvery different angles, Husserl (1929\/1966) and Bergson (1907\/1911)  as well as Freud and Lacan \n(Malpas, 1996) have also argued for the impossibility of observing this flow.) \n8 For the application of Whitehead to human emotion see, for example, Dibben\u2019s (2001) study on \ntrust. \n9 In the 17th century, a new metaphysics evolved, which postulated that everything which is \nconsisted of matter. Although the substance, viz. matter, was new, the basic concept dated back to \nthe Neoplatonic ontology stating that there can only be one source of being, or that being is one \nand incomposite. In consequence, change always involved composition, and every changing object \nwas to be conceived as consisting of a number of smaller units, which did not change themselves \nbut were recombined in different figurations.  \n10 This argument places Psychology on the side of the social sciences, although I am aware that \nmany psychologists will not be happy with this classification. \n11 For a comparison of central assumptions in both philosophies see Rosenthal (1999, 1996). \n12 Kant\u2019s argument is, of course, not unrelated to the 17th century ontology discussed above. \nIndeed, the traditional reading of the history of philosophy portrays Kant\u2019s argument as the \nultimate legitimation of the empiricism that was born out of this ontology (Kaulbach, 1968) \n13 In line with his argument on causality and against Hume and Kant, Whitehead (Whitehead, \n1927\/1959, 1929\/1985) argues that we are able to perceive causal efficacy immediately, i.e. not via \nsense perception. As far as human perception is concerned, however, both modes are normally \nfused into a mode he calls \u201csymbolic reference\u201d. \nReferences \n \nAdam, B.
