A 427-km-long combined\nmultichannel reflection and wide-angle refraction seismic profile acquired across the southern\nFrench Guiana margin is interpreted, where plate reconstructions suggest a rift-type setting.\nThe resulting model shows a crustal structure in which 35\u201337-km-thick pre-rift continental\ncrust is thinned by a factor of 6.4 over a distance of \u223c70 km associated with continental break-\nup and the initiation and establishment of seafloor spreading. The ocean\u2013continent boundary is\na transition zone up to 45 km in width, in which the two-layered oceanic-type crustal structure\ndevelops. Although relatively thin at 3.5\u20135.0 km, such thin oceanic crust appears characteristic\nof the margin as a whole.\nThere is no evidence of rift-related magmatism, either as seaward-dipping sequences in the\nreflection data or as a high velocity region in the lower crust in the P-wave velocity model, and as\na such the margin is identified as non-volcanic in type. However, there is also no evidence of the\nrotated fault block and graben structures characteristic of rifted margins. Consequently, the thin\noceanic crust, the rapidity of continental crustal thinning and the absence of characteristic rift-\nrelated structures leads to the conclusion that the southern French Guiana margin has instead\ndeveloped in an oblique rift setting, in which transform motion also played a significant role\nin the evolution of the resulting crustal structure and along-margin segmentation in structural\nstyle.\nKey words: continental margins, crustal structure, oceanic crust, seismic structure.\n1 I N T RO D U C T I O N\nPassive continental margins surround the Atlantic and demonstrate a\nwide variation in crustal structure. In the broadest terms, these mar-\ngins can be divided on the basis of their orientation relative to the di-\nrection of plate motion at the time of break-up, into those that formed\northogonal (rifted, e.g. Hatton Bank\u2014Morgan & Barton 1990;\nGalicia Bank\u2014Whitmarsh et al. 1996; Namibia\u2014Bauer et al. 2000;\nIberia\u2014Dean et al. 2000; Congo-Zaire-Angola\u2014Contrucci et al.\n2004; Goban Spur\u2014Bullock & Minshull 2005; V\u00f8ring\u2014Mjelde et\nal. 2005) and those that have developed parallel (transform, e.g.\nIvory Coast\u2014Peirce et al. 1996; Ghana\u2014Edwards et al. 1997)\n(Fig. 1). In addition, oblique margins combine strike-slip move-\nment with extension and display characteristics of both rifted and\ntransform margins (e.g. Rio Muni and Cameroon-Guinea-Gabon\u2014\nTurner et al. 2003; Wilson et al. 2003).\nFig. 1 summarizes the above examples from the East Atlantic,\nshowing the variation in crustal structure with latitude and demon-\nstrating differences in both the width over which the continental crust\nthins and in the width of the transition zone between continental and\noceanic crust. Rifted margins tend to exhibit crustal thinning over\n100\u2013400 km (Davis & Kusznir 2002) and transition zones of 10\u2013\n170 km (e.g. Dean et al. 2000), and are often associated with faulted\nblock structures formed during rifting (e.g. Peddy et al. 1989). Con-\nversely, transform margins show more abrupt crustal thinning and a\nvery rapid transition from continental to oceanic type crust within\na zone less than 30 km in width (e.g. Edwards et al. 1997).\nCrustal structure may also be highly influenced by the degree\nof rift-related magmatism, allowing further classification into two\nend-member types: volcanic and non-volcanic. The evolution of vol-\ncanic margins is dominated by extensive igneous activity, manifest\nas basaltic lava flows and imaged in multichannel seismic (MCS)\nreflection data as seaward-dipping reflection events (e.g. V\u00f8ring\u2014\nMutter et al. 1984). These margins are also characterized by mag-\nmatic underplate imaged as a high velocity region (>7.2 kms\u22121) in\nthe lower crust in wide-angle (WA) velocity\u2013depth models. Non-\nvolcanic margins exhibit none of these features (e.g. Iberia\u2014Dean\net al. 2000).\n964 C\u00a9 2007 The Authors\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2007 RAS\nCrustal structure of the French Guiana margin, West Equatorial Atlantic 965\n60\u02daW\n60\u02daW\n0\u02da\n0\u02da\n0\u02da 0\u02da\n60\u02daN 60\u02daN\na\nb\nc\nd\ne\nf\ng\nh\ni\nj\nACE\n0\n10\n20\n30\n0 100\n(a)\nCCTOC\n0\n10\n20\n30\n0 100\n(b)\nCCTOC\n0\n10\n20\n30\n0 100\n(c)\nCCTOC\/T\n0\n10\n20\n30\n0 100\n(d)\nCCTOC\n0\n10\n20\n30\n0 100 200 300\n(e)\nCCTOC\n0\n10\n20\n30\n0100\n(f)\nCCTOC\n0\n10\n20\n30\n0 100\n(g)\nCC\n0\n10\n20\n30\n0100200\n(h)\nCCTOCTOC\n0\n10\n20\n30\n100 200 300\n(i)\nCCTOC\n0\n10\n20\n30\n0100200300400\n(j)\nCCTOC\nFigure 1.

The inset shows the geographic location of each example colour coded for margin type (red: volcanic; blue: non-volcanic; green:\ntransform; orange: composite rift-transform characteristics). The location of the ACE study area is shown for reference (black box).\nWhilst these structural styles enable broad classification of pas-\nsive margins, local factors further influence their crustal structure\nand result in margin segmentation on many length scales. The most\nobvious form of segmentation is the first-order discontinuity in ge-\nometry of rifted margins resulting from transform faults, as observed\non bathymetric, magnetic and gravity data from the Central Atlantic\n(Fig. 2). Segmentation is further evident in along-strike variation in\nthe effective elastic thickness (Te\u2014e.g. Watts & Stewart 1998), rift-\nrelated magmatism (e.g. Callot & Geoffroy 2002; Wu et al. 2006),\nexhumed and serpentinized mantle (e.g. Whitmarsh et al. 1996),\npresence of thin oceanic crust (e.g. Whitmarsh et al. 1993) and the\nextent of syn- and post-rift subsidence (e.g. White & McKenzie\n1989; Stewart et al. 2000). However, the origin of such along-strike\nvariation is not clear and may reflect one or more of: the kinematics\nof break-up; the rate and duration of rifting; the underlying man-\ntle temperature; the rate and mode of accretion of adjacent oceanic\nlithosphere; large-scale lateral variation in the composition and rates\nof erosion and flux of sediment; and the geology and physical prop-\nerties of the pre-rift continental lithosphere (the inheritance).\nTo understand the origin and development of such along-strike\nvariation in crustal structure, the Northeast Brazil and French\nGuiana margin was selected as the basis of the Amazon Cone Ex-\nperiment (ACE\u2014Watts & Peirce 2004). As part of the ACE, five\nseismic margin transects were acquired (Fig. 2). Profile A was lo-\ncated across the southern French Guiana margin where plate recon-\nstructions (e.g. Blarez 1986; Benkhelil et al. 1995\u2014Fig. 3) suggest\na rift-type setting. Profile D traverses the northeast margin of the\nDemerera Plateau, whose evolution gravity, bathymetry and mag-\nnetic data suggest is strongly controlled by transform continental\nbreak-up associated with the St. Paul Fracture Zone which inter-\nsects the margin at this location (Fig. 2). In addition, Profiles B, E\nand F were designed to image the areal variation in crustal structure\nand sedimentation beneath the Amazon Cone which is one of the\nlargest deep-sea fan systems to have formed on the Earth\u2019s surface.\nThe fan sediments act as a significant plate load and enable a flexural\nstudy of if and how lithospheric strength develops after the cessation\nof rifting.\nIn this paper we present the results of modelling seismic and\ngravity data acquired along Profile A, while Rodger et al. (2006)\npresent the results from Profile B.\n2 R E G I O N A L T E C T O N I C S E T T I N G\nPlate reconstructions (Blarez 1986; Nu\u00a8rnberg & Mu\u00a8ller 1991;\nBenkhelil et al. 1995) show that prior to continental break-up,\nFrench Guiana and Northeast Brazil were conjugate to Guinea,\nC\u00a9 2007 The Authors, GJI, 169, 964\u2013987\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2007 RAS\n966 C.

The sep-\naration of South America from Africa occurred during the early\nCretaceous (\u223c110 Ma\u2014Nu\u00a8rnberg & Mu\u00a8ller 1991). This opening is\nthought to have been largely accommodated by motion along the\nlarge-offset transform faults that presently offset the Mid-Atlantic\nRidge (MAR). Past locations of these faults are embedded in the\nfabric of the seabed topography and in the gravity and magnetic\nfields (Fig. 2), and may be traced across the Atlantic to both its east\nand west margins.\nStudies of the conjugate West African margin have shown that,\nto the north, the Liberia margin is rifted (Mascle 1976), while to the\nsouth, offshore Ghana (Peirce et al. 1996; Edwards et al. 1997), the\nmargin has transform characteristics. These along-strike structural\ndifferences are mirrored along the South American margin, implying\na largely rift-type margin north of the Amazon River and a transform\ndominated margin to the south.\nPrior to ACE, existing seismic data (confined largely to the North-\neast Brazil margin) comprise shallow reflection and sonobuoy re-\nfraction profiles (Edgar & Ewing 1968; Houtz 1977; Houtz et al.\n1977), which provide little information on lower crust and upper\nmantle structure. Damuth & Kumar (1975), Castro et al. (1978) and\nBraga (1991) identify an unconformity within the sediment column\nwhich they attribute to the initiation of clastic sediment deposi-\ntion onto the margin from the Amazon River at \u223c10 Ma (Cobbold\net al. 2004). Extrapolation of sedimentation rates from piston cores\n(Damuth & Kumar 1975) and the dating of cessation of pelagic sed-\nimentation and influx of terrigenous material at Deep Sea Drilling\nProject (DSDP) drilling site 354 (Supko et al. 1977), suggest an age\nof 7.8\u201312.2 Ma (mid-late Miocene). Benjamin et al. (1987) con-\nclude that the most likely source of this sediment was the uplift and\nerosion in the Bolivian Andes at this time, which disrupted the re-\ngional drainage pattern in the Amazon basin and diverted it from\nthe Pacific into the Atlantic to be deposited as the Amazon Cone\ndeep-sea fan system.\nInterpretation of commercial seismic data agrees with plate re-\nconstructions and shows that the margin started to rift during the\nearly Cretaceous (Pereira da Siva 1989; Silva et al. 1999; Mello\net al. 2001; Cobbold et al. 2004) with, in the Amazon region,\nC\u00a9 2007 The Authors, GJI, 169, 964\u2013987\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2007 RAS\nCrustal structure of the French Guiana margin, West Equatorial Atlantic 967\nFigure 3. Reconstruction for the opening of the equatorial Atlantic for the Demerara Plateau and adjacent areas offshore French Guiana. The location of ACE\nProfile A is indicated. Benkhelil et al.\u2019s (1995) model suggests that the initiation of continental break-up is a result of transtensional motion between the African\nand South American plates during the Early Cretaceous which resulted in the inception of seafloor spreading by the early Late Cretaceous. The results of this\nstudy are consistent with this model.\nrift-related structures imaged on the inner shelf, where a syn-rift,\nmainly coarse clastic sequence of \u223c100\u2013115 Ma age is overlain by a\npost-rift, mainly fan-delta and platform carbonate sequence of 0\u2013\n100 Ma age (Branda\u02dco & Feijo\u00b4 1994). Consequently, the Amazon\nCone was emplaced on the Northeast Brazil margin \u223c90\u2013105 Ma\nafter rifting ceased.\nAlso prior to the ACE, the only constraint on deep crustal struc-\nture along the margin as a whole was a gravity transect of the Amapa\nShelf and Amazon Cone (Fig. 2). The only available constraint on\ndensities at the time derived from velocities obtained from sonobuoy\ndata (e.g. Houtz 1977) using a 1-D approach to data analysis. Braga\n(1991) modelled the Bouguer anomaly and concluded that the conti-\nnental crust beneath the shelf is about 30\u201335 km thick and, seaward,\nthe oceanic crust is about 10 km thick. However, this modelling\ncould not determine the nature of the crust within the 400-km-wide\nregion defining the ocean\u2013continent transition (OCT), nor the role\n(if any) that magmatism played during rifting.\nFurther north at the French Guiana margin, existing seismic data\nare limited to industry MCS and well data (Gouyet et al. 1993) and\nsite survey and borehole data from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP)\nsites 1257 to 1261 (Erbacher et al. 2004), acquired between 8.5\u25e6N\nand 9.5\u25e6N, 53.5\u25e6W and 55\u25e6W on the Demerara Plateau (Fig. 2).\nThese data will be used as the primary stratigraphic reference for\nthe sediment column for this study.\n3 T H E DATA S E T\nThe data set collected in November 2003 onboard the RRS Dis-\ncovery, consists of six MCS reflection profiles, totalling over\n2100 km in length (Fig. 2). Ocean-bottom seismographs and hy-\ndrophones (OBS\/Hs) were deployed along five of these pro-\nfiles, with additional land stations on two of these profiles (A &\nD). Underway bathymetry, gravity and magnetic data were ac-\nquired along each profile. The Global Positioning System (GPS)\nwas used as the navigational reference and time standard for\nall seismic acquisition.

Bathymetric\ncontours are shown every 1000 m (solid), together with the 100 m (dashed)\nand 500 m (dotted) contours to highlight the location of the continental slope\nand rise.\n3.1 Regional stratigraphy\nWe have used industry MCS and borehole data from ODP sites\n1257 to 1261 (Gouyet et al. 1993; Silva et al. 1999; Erbacher et\nal. 2004) to provide the stratigraphic reference for the sediment\ncolumn imaged within the region and, in particular, along Profile\nA (Fig. 5). Silva et al. (1999) observe that, within the Amazon\nCone, mid-late Miocene-Recent sediments are characterized by low\namplitude, discontinuous seismic facies. In contrast, the underlying\nPalaeocene\u2013mid-Miocene sediments are identified as continuous,\nparallel, high-amplitude facies. Only a thin veneer of the Miocene-\nRecent sediments is observed by Erbacher et al. (2004) over the\nDemerara Plateau. Furthermore, they show that the sediment column\nmay be characterized by five key MCS reflectors (O, A, B, B\u2019 and\nC) which divide the seismic stratigraphy into four major units (1\u20134).\nErbacher et al. (2004) use the five ODP borehole logs to correlate\nthis seismic stratigraphy with lithology (Fig. 5) as follows.\nDirectly beneath the seafloor, Unit 1 is identified as semi-lithified\nsediment (primarily Miocene-Pliocene nannofossil ooze), which\nthins seawards. Seismically, the unit consists of a well-defined set\nof coherent reflection events of varying amplitude with a bright re-\nflection event capping a seismically incoherent zone in the lowest\n50 ms of the unit.\nReflector A is presumed to be a lower Miocene erosional uncon-\nformity which separates Unit 1 from Unit 2, a mainly Eocene-early\nMiocene nannofossil chalk sequence with Reflector B at its base.\nUnit 2 ranges in \u2018thickness\u2019 at the ODP sites, from 160 to 495 ms\ntwo-way traveltime (TWTT). The unit shows incoherent reflection\ncharacteristics which Erbacher et al. (2004) interpret as either a\ndisturbed sediment package or the effect of side echoes from local\ntopography.\nReflector B marks the top of Unit 3 and is hummocky on a local\nscale, most likely cut by channels. The uppermost section of Unit\n3, named Unit 3a, contains several high-amplitude reflection events\noverlying a transparent zone to the top of Reflector B\u2019. The unit\nappears flat lying and ranges from 40 to 160 ms \u2018thick\u2019 between the\nboreholes. Reflector B\u2019 lies within Unit 3 and represents the top of\na black shale sequence. The presence of Type II kerogen within the\nshale indicates a marine source for the organic matter.\nReflector C is defined as the base of the black shale sequence.\nUnderlying Unit 4 consists of Albian-age claystone, clayey siltstone\nand sandstone. At Site 1257 the Unit 4 reflectors appear folded into\na low amplitude anticline, which intersects with Reflector C as an\nangular unconformity.\nDating of borehole cores suggests that sedimentation rates have\nvaried during the last \u223c110 Myr. In the late Cretaceous deposi-\ntion occurred at 3\u20139 m Myr\u22121, increasing markedly across the K-T\nboundary to 7\u201315 m Myr\u22121 during the Palaeocene to mid-Eocene,\nwith deposition rates having a pronounced 20\u201350 kyr periodicity.\nRecent sediments are generally too thin to obtain a good estimate\nof sedimentation rate. However, at site 1261 sedimentation rates of\nup to 65 m Myr\u22121 in the late Miocene-early Pliocene are observed.\n3.2 Multichannel seismic data\nAs part of the ACE, MCS data were acquired using a 2.4 km, 96-\nchannel streamer with shots fired by an array of 14 airguns of various\nchamber sizes totalling 6520 in3 (\u223c107 l) in volume. The array was\nof a compromise design, producing a high energy, relatively low\nfrequency source signature for deep crustal WA seismic data acqui-\nsition, whilst also being compatible with contemporaneous MCS\nimaging. Shots were fired at 40 s intervals which, at a surveying\nspeed of \u223c4.85 kn, results in an average shot interval of \u223c100 m.\nData were recorded for 20 s after each shot and at a sampling in-\nterval of 4 ms. Processing was undertaken using ProMAX, with a\nsimple processing flow (which included velocity analysis, stacking,\nmultiple removal\/suppression and time migration) giving the best\nresults. The processed MCS data image the entire sediment column,\nC\u00a9 2007 The Authors, GJI, 169, 964\u2013987\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2007 RAS\nCrustal structure of the French Guiana margin, West Equatorial Atlantic 969\nFigure 5. Regional seismic stratigraphic reference line C2206a of Erbacher et al. (2004), developed from MCS data acquired as part of commercial and ODP\nsite survey studies. See text for details;\nfrom a relatively smooth seafloor down to the top of the basement\n(Fig. 6).\nA 3.5 to 4.5 s TWTT sedimentary zone is identified from strati-\nfied reflectors with interval velocities ranging from 1.6 to 3.5 km s\u22121\n(Fig. 6). The interval velocity gradient within the top kilometre\nbelow seafloor (\u223c0.8 s\u22121) is relatively steep, suggesting a rapidly\ncompacting upper unit overlying a lower unit of lower gradient\n(\u223c0.25 s\u22121).\nSeveral sedimentary packages are identified in Fig. 6, each sep-\narated by a clear reflection event, which can often be traced across\nthe whole profile. A significant high amplitude reflection event at\n\u223c7.5 s TWTT is interpreted as an unconformity (labelled MM in\nFig. 6), separating subparallel reflectors below from those onlapping\nabove. This unconformity shows similar characteristics to another\nidentified within the sedimentary stratigraphy of the Amazon Cone\nto the south (Silva et al. 1999; Rodger et al. 2006), which has been\ndated as mid-Miocene in age (Damuth & Kumar 1975; Braga 1991).\nThe latter unconformity separates shallow late-Miocene, Pliocene\nand Quaternary sediments above from deeper Cretaceous to early-\nMiocene sediments below, and which Braga (1991) used to date\nthe onset of the fan deposition. There is little evidence of post-rift\nfaulting within the sediments further offshore. However, heading\nlandwards as the slope increases towards the continental shelf, we\ninterpret the complex patterns of reflection events as evidence of sig-\nnificant slumping along large faults (Fig. 7). The hummocky nature\nof the basement reflection beneath the deepest sediments suggests\nthat the underlying crust is oceanic and, consequently, that all sedi-\nments imaged are post-rift.\nThe sediments above the mid-Miocene unconformity were sub-\ndivided into three units for inclusion in the main WA seismic model,\nbased on the strongest, most continuous reflectors. Two further units\nwere identified beneath the unconformity. A clear basement reflec-\ntion is observed heading landwards to \u223c240 km, at which point it\nbecomes obscured by the seafloor multiple (Fig. 6). There is no evi-\ndence of any reflectors (e.g. Moho) beneath the basement reflector.\nThere is also no evidence for tilted basement fault blocks, commonly\nobserved at rifted continental margins (e.g. Goban Spur\u2014Peddy et\nal. 1989) nor seaward-dipping reflector (SDR) sequences often as-\nsociated with volcanic margins.\n3.3. Marine wide-angle refraction data\nTwenty OBS\/Hs were deployed along Profile A (Fig. 4). All instru-\nments were equipped with hydrophones and additionally, 13 were\nfitted with three-component 4.5 Hz geophone packages. Instruments\nwere deployed at 10 km intervals from the base of the continental\nslope, across the rise and out into the abyssal plain. All instruments\nwere successfully recovered, however OBS 8 failed to record any\nusable data.\nDirect water waves (W w) and crustal diving rays (Ps and Pg) are\nobserved as first arrivals on all WA record sections (Figs 8\u201311).\nIn addition, mantle (Pn) diving rays are also recorded by OBS\/Hs\ndeployed at the seaward end of the profile. Secondary phases are\nobserved and identified as intra-sediment and intra-crustal arrivals,\nintra-crustal reflections (PgP) and Moho reflections (PmP). The sed-\niment arrivals are subdivided into five types (Ps1 to Ps5) to be con-\nsistent with the MCS data, and crustal arrivals into two types (Pg1\nto Pg2) to accommodate the major changes in velocity observed on\nthe record sections, and to be compatible with the standard models\nof oceanic and continental crustal structure (e.g. Spudich & Orcutt\n1980; Bratt & Purdy 1984; Christensen & Mooney 1995). Seabed\nand intra-crustal multiples are also observed.\nIn general, the OBS\/H data show clear sedimentary and upper\nbasement (1.7 to 4.5 km s\u22121) first arrivals emerging from the direct\nwater wave, out to source-receiver offsets of \u223c15 km. Mid-lower\ncrustal (\u223c6 km s\u22121) and uppermost mantle (\u223c8 km s\u22121) arrivals are\nC\u00a9 2007 The Authors, GJI, 169, 964\u2013987\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2007 RAS\n970 C. J.

The\nmain characteristics of each example section are briefly described\nbelow.\nOBS 20 is located at the seaward end of the profile (Fig. 8) and its\nrecord section shows relatively symmetrical arrivals either side of\nthe instrument position. Sedimentary first arrivals (Ps) are recorded\nat source-receiver offsets of \u223c7\u201315 km, with P-wave velocities no\ngreater than \u223c3 km s\u22121. A clear secondary arrival, however, indi-\ncates higher velocities >3.5 km s\u22121. For the crust, low amplitude\nfirst arrivals (Pg) are observed at \u223c15\u201323 km offset at velocities in\nexcess of 6 km s\u22121 and, to offsets of \u223c60 km, upper mantle (Pn)\ndiving rays at velocities \u223c8 km s\u22121. The large amplitude Moho re-\nflection (PmP) at offsets greater than \u223c23 km constrains the to-\ntal crustal thickness at between 8 and 10 km. These velocities are\nC\u00a9 2007 The Authors, GJI, 169, 964\u2013987\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2007 RAS\nCrustal structure of the French Guiana margin, West Equatorial Atlantic 971\nFigure 8.

This asymmetry suggests a major\nstructural change within the crust. There are several possibilities\nwhich may not be mutually exclusive:\n(a) a significant increase in thickness of the sediment column is\nobserved on the MCS data;\n(b) the seabed rapidly shallows on the continental rise and slope\nand\n(c) crustal thickness should increase landwards associated with\nthe OCT.\n3.4 Land wide-angle refraction data\nFive SEIS-UK 6TD land seismographs were deployed to record the\nmarine shots at large offset. This onshore extension of the profile\nwas designed to image the thickness and structure of the pre-rift\ncrust and provide control on the lower crustal structure in the region\nbeneath the shelf\/rise where it changes most rapidly adjacent to the\nOCT. The instruments were deployed between Cayenne and Cacao\nin French Guiana (Fig. 4), and were all located within 47 km of the\ncoastline. The furthest instrument inland was located \u223c160 km from\nthe most landward shot. All instruments recorded a similar pattern of\narrivals and an example data section from land station 25 (Fig. 4) is\nshown in Fig. 12. Using a reduction velocity of 8 km s\u22121 to highlight\nlower crust and upper mantle phases, the first arrivals dip gradually\nwith a velocity of \u223c6 km s\u22121 and are identified as Pg phases. A\nclear PmP arrival is observed at \u223c8 s traveltime between \u223c130 and\n190 km offset, together with an upper mantle Pn arrival of velocity\n\u223c8 km s\u22121. The transition between these phases is complicated by\nthe lateral variation in sediment thickness coupled with the variation\nin seabed depth beneath the corresponding shots.\n4 S E I S M I C M O D E L L I N G\nA P-wave velocity\u2013depth model of the crust was constructed by for-\nward modelling the WA seismic data using the MCS data to provide\nconstraint on the layering within the sediment column and the depth\nto basement. Traveltime picking followed the approach outlined by\nZelt (1999) with an error of \u00b115 ms (\u223c4 samples) assigned to near-\noffset first arrivals and between \u00b120 and 100 ms for longer offset\narrivals depending on the signal-to-noise ratio. Secondary arrivals\noften had their onset masked by preceding arrivals. Consequently,\nthe error was increased by \u00b140 ms (about half a wavelength). The\nland station data were assigned larger errors (\u00b1100 to 200 ms) due\nto difficulties in arrival identification, the lack of a clear first break\nand an increase in the level of background noise.\n4.1 Forward modelling\nForward traveltime modelling was undertaken using RAYINVR (Zelt\n& Smith, 1992), adopting a strategy closely resembling that of Zelt\n(1999) in which a starting model was created using a simplistic 1-D\ninterpretation of first arrival data for each instrument draped beneath\nthe seafloor. The main sedimentary layers and basement surface\nwere incorporated from the MCS data interpretation, converting the\nTWTTs of interfaces to depth using the processing-based interval\nvelocities.\nExamples of the ray-trace modelling are shown for OBS 2, 7, 16,\n20 and land station 25 in Figs 8\u201312.

The best-fit, preferred\nmodel (Fig. 13) is 427 km in length with land instruments located\nbetween 0 and 45 km model offset and OBS\/Hs between 193 and\n383 km offset. Shots were fired between 117 and 425 km model\noffset.\n4.2 Results\nThe best-fit P-wave velocity model is defined by the water column\n(identified as Water on Fig. 13), five sediment layers (Sediments),\nthe basement crust and the upper mantle (identified as Mantle). The\nbasement crust is further divided into two layers termed Layer 2 and\nLayer 3 to reflect the oceanic-type crust expected at the seaward end\nof the profile, and Upper Crust and Lower Crust for the continental-\ntype crust expected at the landward end of the profile. A comparison\nof layer boundaries which define the P-wave velocity model with\nreflectors picked from the MCS data is shown in Fig. 6.\nThe model can be broadly divided into (Fig. 13):\n(i) sediment column (180\u2013430 km model offset);\n(ii) continental crust (0\u2013135 km);\n(iii) thinned continental crust (135\u2013206 km);\n(iv) the transition zone (206\u2013250 km) and\n(v) oceanic crust (250\u2013430 km).\nThe characteristics of each of these are discussed below and a\nsummary of layer P-wave velocities and thicknesses is contained in\nTable 2. Quantitative analysis of the resolution of the model and the\ngoodness of fit to the observed data is summarized in Table 1.\n4.3.1 Sediment column\nBeneath the seabed, the P-wave velocity model comprises five sedi-\nmentary layers within the Sediment unit\u2014termed S1-S5.

The conversion of the\nfinal WA model into TWTT (Fig. 6) demonstrates the consistency\nbetween sedimentary layer boundaries and the prominent events in\nthe reflection data.\nA major unconformity at \u223c7.5 s TWTT (Fig. 6) separates the up-\nper sediments (S1-S3) from those below (S4-S5) and is associated\nwith a large change in velocity gradient (0.65\u20130.30 s\u22121) (Figs 13\nand 14). Few refracted arrivals are observed from the lower sedimen-\ntary layers and the final model shows significant lateral thinning and\nvelocity decrease oceanwards. The velocity gradient in these layers\n(0.30 s\u22121) is consistent with the very low interval velocity gradient\nimmediately below the unconformity derived from the MCS data,\nwhich in turn increases with depth (Fig. 6).\nThe base of the Sediment column is primarily constrained by a\ncombination of refractions (Pg) and reflections (PgP), to be a smooth\nsurface (within the resolution of the WA data at that depth) with\nup to \u223c2 km of topography along the entire profile.

However, Layer 3 is well constrained, with\nthe highest velocities (7.2\u20137.5 km s\u22121) found in the lowermost crust\nbetween 255 and 340 km offset. The oceanic Moho lies at a depth of\n\u223c17 km below sea surface (bss) beneath the edge of the continental\nshelf shallowing to 10 km beneath the abyssal plain. Layers 2 and\n3 together range in thickness from 3.5\u20135 km, of which 2\u20133 km is\nLayer 3.\nThe high velocities observed at the base of the oceanic crust\noccupy a region less than 0.7 km thick. These velocities are consis-\ntent with those observed within regions interpreted as underplate\n(Morgan & Barton 1990; Holbrook et al. 1994b). However, there\nis no evidence of SDR sequences within the MCS data to sup-\nport this interpretation. An alternative interpretation is that the high\nvelocities reflect some degree of serpentinization, possibly as a re-\nsult of water ingress along large-offset faults or fracture zones within\nthe crust (e.g. Bonatti 1978; Fox & Gallo 1986).\n4.3.3 Continental crust\nThe crust landward of 140 km model offset is identified as continen-\ntal. Although ray coverage is quite limited in this region due to the\nacquisition geometry, the WA model shows a two-layered crust, the\nbase of which is constrained at a maximum depth of \u223c37.5 km by\nPmP arrivals, and the Moho shallows slightly seawards to a depth\nof \u223c34.5 km at 135 km offset.\n4.3.4 Thinned continental crust\nThe crust between 135 and 206 km model offset is identified as\nthinned continental in type from its crustal velocity\u2013depth profile\nwhich is consistent with global averages from thinned crust imaged\nin continental margin settings (Fig. 14; Peirce et al. 1996). However,\nthe top of the Upper Crust layer shows no evidence, either in the\nWA model or in the MCS data, of the large-scale rotated fault blocks\nand half graben observed at many rifted continental margins (e.g.\nGoban Spur\u2014Peddy et al. 1989).\nBy \u223c206 km model offset the crust has thinned from \u223c37.5 km\nto \u223c5.2 km thick. This thinning is largely accommodated within the\nupper crust (from 6.5 km to 2.2 km) between 175 and 206 km offset\nand in lower crust (25.5 km to 3 km) between 135 and 206 km offset.\nThis is equivalent to a shallowing of the Moho from 34.5 to 14.4 km\nbetween the continental shelf and the base of the continental rise,\nand corresponds to thinning by a factor of 6.4 over a distance of\n70 km.\n4.3.5 Transition zone\nThe region between 206 and 250 km model offset is identified as a\ntransition zone as it expresses neither distinct oceanic or continental\ncharacteristics. It also lies landward of the region of higher velocities\nidentified within the very base of the oceanic crust adjacent to this\nzone whose location also corresponds to a 1\u20131.25 km depression in\nthe surface of the basement and thinning of Layer 2.\n4.3.6 Resolution\nQuantitative analysis of the ray-trace traveltimes and the data picks\ndemonstrates that the model fits the data within the error bounds (see\nTable 1). Although the goal of modelling was to achieve a statisti-\ncal data fit to within the assigned error bounds on each traveltime\npick, using a \u03c7 2 of <1 as the measure of the misfit for each phase\ntype and each layer separately within the model, not all instruments\nand phases could be matched within these criteria. For the land in-\nstruments, overall all arrivals were modelled to an error of 126 ms\nand \u03c7 2 of 1.4. Seaward of OBS 1 the model has a much improved\nresolution with a total misfit of just 36 ms and a \u03c72 of 0.9.\nA fit to within these criteria does not guarantee the uniqueness\nof the model as traveltimes are dependant upon both seismic ve-\nlocity and propagation path length. Therefore, an adequate data fit\ncan often be obtained by increasing one and decreasing the other\nof these parameters and vice versa. However, the resulting model\nuncertainties associated with this trade-off have been estimated by\nsystematically varying the model parameters and, hence, sensitivity\ntesting modelled horizons and layer velocities. An upper bound on\nthe misfit was also applied above which the model and\/or its sub-\nparts were considered \u2018out of range\u2019. For the OBS\/H arrivals a misfit\nabove \u00b1100 ms was considered the upper limit (e.g. Edwards et al.\n1997), while for the land station arrivals this was set at \u00b1250 ms.\nThe resulting resolution in velocity and thickness of each model\nlayer is outlined in Table 2.\n5 G R AV I T Y M O D E L L I N G\nGravity modelling was undertaken primarily as a test of validity and\nuniqueness of the WA model, and secondly to provide additional\nconstraints on the variation in crustal thickness and Moho geometry\nbeneath the continental slope and shelf where the ray coverage is\nlimited.\nThe free-air anomaly (FAA) acquired whilst shot firing was used\nas the basis of the modelling (Fig. 13). This anomaly was also cor-\nrelated with the satellite-derived anomaly (Sandwell & Smith 1997)\nto compare the longer-wavelength anomaly characteristics associ-\nated with deeper crust and uppermost mantle variation. The FAA is\nstriking in that it is, given the underlying crustal structure, remark-\nably simple with the most prominent feature being the margin edge\neffect high (e.g. Watts & Marr 1995). However, the French Guiana\nmargin transect is unusual in that the characteristic accompanying\nedge effect low on the seaward side of the margin is absent.\n5.1 Initial model\nAs a starting point for modelling, the velocity\u2013depth model was\ninitially converted to a density model using the velocity\u2013density\nrelationship of Nafe & Drake (1957) (Ludwig et al. 1970), coupled\nwith the relationships of Carlson & Raskin (1984) and Christensen\n& Mooney (1995). Model densities are quoted in g cm\u22123, mainly for\nreasons of clarity of annotation on Fig. 13\u20141 g cm\u22123 is equivalent\nto 1000 kg m\u22123 in S.I. units.\nThe Nafe & Drake (1957) relationship is based on measurements\nof sediment velocity and density, and thus this method was used\nprimarily to assign initial densities to the Sediment layer seaward of\nthe shelf break. Christensen & Mooney\u2019s (1995) velocity\u2013density\nrelationship for the continental crust was used primarily to assign\ndensities landwards of the shelf break, while the relationships of\nCarlson & Raskin (1984) for the oceanic crust were applied seaward\nof the shelf break. A density of 1.03 g cm\u22123 was assigned to the water\nC\u00a9 2007 The Authors, GJI, 169, 964\u2013987\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2007 RAS\n980 C. J. Greenroyd et al.\ncolumn and the uppermost mantle a density of 3.31 g cm\u22123 (Kuo &\nForsyth, 1988)\u2014a value commonly used in gravity studies of con-\ntinental margins (e.g. Wu et al. 2006). To best represent the P-wave\nvelocity gradients, model layers were also constructed with density\ngradients following seismic velocity contour geometries with, on\naverage, an increase in velocity of 0.1 km s\u22121 correlating with an\nincrease in density of 0.02 g cm\u22123, between 1.6 km s\u22121 just below\nthe seabed and 7.0 km s\u22121 which defines the base of the crust for the\nmajority of the seismic model.\nFAA modelling was carried out using GRAV2D (a 2-D approach\nbased on the Talwani et al. 1959 algorithm). As the purpose of the\n2-D gravity modelling is to test the validity and uniqueness of the\nseismic modelling, layer boundaries were not varied to improve the\ngravity fit; the only exception being the depth to Moho between 135\nand 200 km, where seismic constraint is limited.\n5.2 Results\nThe results of gravity modelling are shown in Fig. 13 and layer\ndensities are summarized in Table 2. Overall, the fit between the\ncalculated and observed anomalies is excellent, lying well within\nthe associated error for the majority of the profile for the preferred\nmodel. The most significant misfits are centred on:\n(i) 180 km offset, at the peak of the margin edge effect. This misfit\nmost likely results from the depth and geometry of the Moho in this\nregion of the model, though may also reflect the lack of constraint\non sediment thickness on the continental shelf due to an absence of\nclear MCS reflections.\n(ii) 240\u2013280 km model offset, the region in which the character-\nistic flanking low associated with the margin edge effect high would\nbe expected (e.g. Watts & Marr 1995). This misfit correlates with\nthe region interpreted as the oceanward limit of the transition zone\nbetween thinned continental and oceanic type crust. The nature of\nthe misfit implies either that the crust and\/or sediment layers are too\nthin or that the density is too high.\n(iii) 370\u2013400 km model offset. Towards these longer profile dis-\ntances the seismic resolution of the sub-sediment crustal layers is\nlimited due to the relative offset between shots and the OBS\/Hs\nat the seaward end of the profile. In addition, the Mu\u00a8ller et al.\n(1997) crustal age model (Fig. 15) suggests that a transform\/fracture\nzone intersects Profile A approximately between OBS\/Hs 18\u201320\n(Fig. 13) which correlates with a depression in the oceanic crustal\nbasement surface and a thickening of the lowest sediment layer (S5).\nThe gravity misfit implies thinner crust and\/or sediment layers or\nthat the model density within this region is too low.\nThe density-depth model was used to test these possibilities, fix-\ning the Moho depth where the gravity fit was acceptable and varying\nthe model within the 240\u2013280 km and 370\u2013400 km misfit regions.\nAn improved fit can be achieved by an increase in crustal thick-\nness at 260 km offset of around 750 m, and by thinning of the crust\nat 385 km offset by around 600 m. Despite the dense ray cover-\nage in both these localities, the seismic resolution is not capable of\ndistinguishing between the original model and the adjusted model.\nHowever, the gravity modelling also suggests that either a slight in-\ncrease in Moho depth or a slight decrease in crustal density, perhaps\nas a result of serpentinization, is the cause of the misfit around 240\u2013\n280 km offset, and that crustal thinning is the most likely origin of\nthe misfit around 385 km offset.\n6 D I S C U S S I O N\nThe ACE aimed to reveal crustal structural variation along the equa-\ntorial continental margin of South America and determine the ge-\nometry and mode of opening of the Atlantic and the role, if any,\nplayed by magmatism during rifting. This margin was chosen for\nstudy since it is located proximal to a region of numerous transform\nfaults, which currently offset the MAR (Fig. 2). The corresponding\nfracture zones appear to be long-lived features associated with, or\nresulting from, the initial break-up geometry since they can be traced\nfrom the MAR to each margin and appear correlated with the along-\nmargin variation between rift-type and transform-type settings (Fig.\n15). In this context, Profile A was located across the French Guiana\nmargin within a region thought to be of rift-type.\n6.1 Volcanic versus non-volcanic margin\nDeep crustal seismic studies of the Atlantic margins have shown that\ncontinental rifting does not always take place by a process of simple\nstretching followed by thermal subsidence (Sleep 1971; McKenzie\n1978) but may also be associated with massive thicknesses of ig-\nneous material (Mutter et al. 1984; White et al. 1987; Holbrook\net al. 1994a) accreted into the crust. These observations led to pas-\nsive margins being classified as either volcanic or non-volcanic (sed-\nimentary) in type. Volcanic margins are characterized by a sequence\nof lower crustal rocks up to 25 km thick (White et al. 1987; White,\n1992), with high velocities in the range 7.2\u20137.5 km s\u22121 in a region\nthat is commonly termed as underplate. Volcanic margins are also\ncharacterized by SDR sequences, which are interpreted as subaerial\nbasaltic flows erupted during the early stages of initial rifting. In con-\ntrast non-volcanic margins lack these volcanic features and instead\nexhibit faulted basement blocks, and for the Atlantic in particular,\nno distinct boundary between thinned continental crustal and nor-\nmal oceanic crust (Dean et al. 2000). As progressively more studies\nof volcanic and non-volcanic margins are undertaken, results sug-\ngest that this characterization may be over-simplistic (Mutter 1993;\nHolbrook et al. 1994a) and that instead the majority of margins ex-\npress volcanic characteristics to some extent (Eldholm et al. 1995;\nGeoffroy 2005).\nInterpretation of the ACE WA model for Profile A shows no evi-\ndence of velocities in excess of 7.0 km s\u22121 in the lower crust within\nthe regions identified as continental in origin. In addition, interpre-\ntation of the coincident MCS data reveals no evidence of SDR se-\nquences, although it has been suggested that such sequences may not\nalways have clear reflection events associated with them (Eldholm\n& Grue 1994; Planke & Eldholm 1994; Planke et al. 2000; Geoffroy\n2005). The continental margin offshore French Guiana in the region\nimaged by Profile A is therefore interpreted as a non-volcanic mar-\ngin. Consequently, all further discussion and comparisons will be\nmade with reference to other non-volcanic Atlantic rifted margins.\nHowever, the role of transform faults and fracture zones in conti-\nnental break-up geometry, margin evolution and crustal structural\ndevelopment will also be considered by reference to the equatorial\nwest Africa transform margins (Fig. 1).\n6.2 Rifting versus transform margin evolution\nThe pre-rift continental crust along Profile A is 34\u201337 km thick,\ncomparable with other margins of the Atlantic. For example, at\nthe Nova Scotia (Funck et al. 2004) and Orphan Basin (Chian\net al. 2001) rifted margins the pre-rift crustal thickness has been\ndetermined at \u223c36 km.

Assuming a stretching factor of 6.4 derived\nfrom the P-wave model (Fig. 13) and that there is no evidence from Pro-\nfile A for rift-related magmatism, Bown & White\u2019s (1995) model predicts\na minimum rift duration of 18 Myrs. Similarly a margin width of \u223c70 km\nand an initial spreading half-rate of 20 mm yr\u22121 (Fig. 15\u2014after Mu\u00a8ller\net al. 1997), suggests that the French Guiana margin formed, when com-\npared with other margins, relatively rapidly with extension confined to a\nrelatively narrow region.\nbasins. Examples of such structures are found at the Goban Spur\n(Horsefield et al. 1993), Biscay (Montadert et al. 1979, de Charpal\net al. 1978), Rockall (England & Hobbs 1997) and Iberia (Pickup\net al. 1996) margins. The French Guiana margin (along Profile A)\ndoes not display any rotated faulted block characteristics, instead\nthe WA model shows the pre-rift continental crust comprising, pri-\nmarily, crystalline basement with a smooth surface, overlain with a\nthin veneer of sediments. Thus, although showing no evidence of\nvolcanic features, the French Guiana margin appears atypical when\ncompared to other non-volcanic margins.\nAlong Profile A, the crystalline basement thins by a factor of\nup to 6.4 (\u03b2 factor) over \u223c70 km distance and this thinning is ac-\ncompanied by a transition zone \u223c45 km wide (see Section 6.3), a\ntotal combined width of \u223c115 km. The rapidity of thinning and the\nwidth of the transition reveal much about the nature of a margin\nand its mode of evolution, with the distance over which thinning\noccurs generally being smaller for transform margins than for rifted\nmargins. Dean et al. (2000) summarize measurements of the width\nof regions of thinned continental (\u223c80\u2013150 km) and transition zone\n(10\u2013120 km) crust and conclude that the typical combined width for\nthe North Atlantic is 100\u2013200 km. At 115 km at most, the French\nGuiana margin lies at the lower end of that range.\nWatts & Fairhead (1997) and Davis & Kusznir (2002) summarize\nthe degree of thinning at Atlantic margins as a function of dis-\ntance from the OCT (Fig. 16). Watts & Fairhead (1997) conclude\nthat margins can be classified into two types\u2014narrow (<75 km)\nand wide (>250 km) rifts\u2014depending on the distance landward of\nthe OCT over which extension occurs. Under this terminology the\nFrench Guiana margin could be described as a narrow rift. How-\never, Davis & Kusznir (2002) conclude that such a definition is\ntoo simplistic and instead use margin width which they define as\nthe distance from pre-rift, unstretched crust to the ocean\u2013continent\nboundary (OCB). Davis & Kusznir (2002) assume the OCB is a\nsharp transition, rather than the wide transition zone (hence the\npreferred term OCT) observed at many margins (e.g. Pickup et al.\n1996), which is commonly interpreted as serpentinized upper man-\ntle exhumed before the onset of seafloor spreading (e.g. Whitmarsh\net al. 2001).\nDespite the uncertainty associated with this assumption, Davis &\nKusznir (2002) show that highly extended margins are associated\nwith slow initial post-break-up seafloor spreading rates and vice\nversa. Using their model, the initial seafloor spreading rate at the\nFrench Guiana margin is anticipated to be relatively high. Mu\u00a8ller\net al.\u2019s (1997) seafloor isochrons for the Atlantic estimate the ini-\ntial, post-rift half-spreading rate at the French Guiana margin at\n\u223c20 mm yr\u22121 (Fig. 15), and that the spreading rate has varied over\ntime to the present day. Relative to global mid-ocean ridge spreading\nrates, \u223c20 mm yr\u22121 half-rate is at the upper end of the slow cate-\ngory (Dick et al. 2003). This spreading rate and the margin width of\n\u223c70\u2013115 km implies that the French Guianan margin was subject\nto relatively high strain rates during rifting.\nBown & White\u2019s (1995) relationship (Fig. 16) between melt thick-\nness and crustal thinning (\u03b2) shows that (assuming the initial thick-\nness of the lithosphere and temperature of the underlying mantle\nremain constant) the longer the rift duration, the less melt is pro-\nduced (Contrucci et al. 2004). A \u03b2 factor of 6.4, and assuming that\nthe French Guiana margin is non-volcanic, provides an estimate of\nrift duration of at least 20 Myr. This is consistent with the proximal\nnon-volcanic Angola margin where the duration of rifting has been\nestimated between 15 and 30 Myr (Moulin 2003).\nThe variation in half-spreading rate along a flow-line from OBS\n1 to the MAR, suggests that the west equatorial region is most\nsimilar to Cogne\u00b4 & Humler\u2019s (2004, 2006) compilations for their\nSouth Atlantic region (0\u25e6\u201355\u25e6S) except between 67 and 48 Ma\n(chrons 31\u201321) which corresponds to the rapid northwards migra-\ntion of the Indian plate (Cogne\u00b4 & Humler 2004), the reorientation\nof spreading in the South Atlantic in response to the rotation of\nSouth American plate relative to North American plate and the on-\nset of transform-style separation between equatorial West Africa\nand Northeast Brazil (Patriat & Achache 1984; Besse & Courtillot\n2002). An alternative interpretation for the narrow margin width is,\nthus, that instead the French Guiana margin is a transform margin.\nC\u00a9 2007 The Authors, GJI, 169, 964\u2013987\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2007 RAS\nCrustal structure of the French Guiana margin, West Equatorial Atlantic 983\nFigure 17.

(v) Juxtaposition of thinned continental crust\nagainst normal thickness oceanic crust across a fracture zone, showing the current setting of Profile A (red) explaining the narrow margin width, degree of\nthinning and the lack of observed rift-related extensional structures in the upper basement.\nIn general, transform margins (e.g. Scrutton 1979;\nNewfoundland\u2014Todd et al. 1988; Barents Sea\u2014Jackson et al.\n1990; Exmouth Plateau\u2014Lorenzo et al. 1991) are characterized\nby a zone of apparent crustal thinning 5\u201330 km wide, an absence\nof the high lower crustal velocities indicative of magmatism\nand an absence of basement rotated fault blocks. Although the\nFrench Guiana margin shares many characteristic features with\nnon-volcanic margins, its narrow margin width and lack of rotated\nfault blocks suggest that the break-up geometry in this part of the\nequatorial Atlantic has a significant transform component.\nRegions of underplate are observed at transform margins (e.g.\nSouthern Exmouth Plateau margin\u2014Lorenzo et al. 1991). At the\nIvory Coast-Ghana transform margin Peirce et al. (1996) observe\nunderplate which they interpret as a localized feature since other\nC\u00a9 2007 The Authors, GJI, 169, 964\u2013987\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2007 RAS\n984 C. J. Greenroyd et al.\nparts of the adjacent Ghana margin show no such evidence (e.g.\nEdwards et al. 1997). Peirce et al. (1996) attribute this lateral vari-\nation to a mode of margin evolution in which dominant transform\nmotion is accompanied by a component of rifting (Fig. 17), and\nwhich results in a margin composed of a series of rift and transform\nsegments (Mascle et al. 1997).\nWilson et al. (2003) describe the architecture of the equatorial\nWest Africa margin (Gabon, Guinea and Cameroon). At this trans-\nform margin, the transition from oceanic to continental crust occurs\nover 75 km, with the crust neither being typically oceanic or con-\ntinental within this region. Wilson et al. (2003) interpret this crust\nas serpentinized peridotite and attribute it to the existence of nu-\nmerous fracture zones which allow the ingress of sea water and\nserpentinization by hydrothermal circulation, of which one mecha-\nnism is via fracturing associated with trans-tension or oblique-slip\nmotion.\n6.3 Oceanic crustal thickness\nOceanic crustal thickness is, on average, 7.1 \u00b1 0.8 km, of which\n2.11\u00b10.55 km is oceanic extrusive Layer 2 and 4.97\u00b10.90 km is in-\ntrusive Layer 3 (Fig. 14; White et al. 1992). However, oceanic crustal\nthickness along Profile A is only 3.5\u20135.0 km. When compared with\nlocal and conjugate margins this thinness is less surprising. For ex-\nample, the average thickness of oceanic crust offshore Ghana is\n4.4 km (Edwards et al. 1997), offshore Gabon-Guinea-Cameroon\n5 km (Wilson et al. 2003) and Congo-Zaire-Angola 5\u20138 km (Watts\n& Stewart 1998; Contrucci et al. 2004).\nThin oceanic crust is found in three main settings (Edwards\net al. 1997); at mid-ocean ridges spreading at ultra-slow rates\n(<15 mm yr\u22121 full rate\u2014Bown & White 1995) where conductive\ncooling of the upwelling mantle results in a reduction in the amount\nof melt produced; adjacent to non-volcanic rifted margins (border-\ning the Atlantic\u2014Whitmarsh et al. 1990, 1993; Pinheiro et al. 1991;\nHorsefield et al. 1993) where conductive heat loss in the mantle re-\nsults from long-lasting stretching of the continental lithosphere prior\nto break-up (Whitmarsh et al. 1993; Bown & White 1995); and at\noceanic transform faults\/fracture zones, which White et al. (1984,\n1992) and Minshull et al. (1991) attribute to a reduced magma sup-\nply to the adjacent mid-ocean ridge segment tips, and Stroup & Fox\n(1981) and Fox & Gallo (1984) attribute to an enhanced cooling\neffect of adjacent colder lithosphere when offsets are large.\nIn this study we estimate that the initial full spreading rate at the\nFrench Guiana margin is \u223c40 mm yr\u22121. Thus it is unlikely that the\nthin oceanic crust is a result of initial ultra-slow spreading. The ex-\ntent of crustal thinning (\u03b2 factor of 6.4) which has occurred within\nthe relatively narrow margin width (\u223c70 km) and the lack of evi-\ndence of rift-related magmatism, implies a rift duration of at least\n18 Myr (Bown & White 1995). The observed thin oceanic crust may\nsimply be the result of a mantle cooled during a prolonged period\nof continental rifting prior to the inception of seafloor spreading.\nHowever, another possibility is that the oceanic crustal production\nrate was lower during the early Cretaceous than at present. Cogne\u00b4 &\nHumler (2004, 2006) consider this possibility and use compositional\nchanges to assess mantle temperature variation from the present to\n180 Ma which, in turn, they use to quantify the volume of magma\ngenerated in a spreading ridge setting. Cogne\u00b4 & Humler (2006)\nconclude that crustal thicknesses were, on global average, \u223c1\u20132 km\nthicker than present before 80 Ma. Thus, it seems unlikely that the\nrelatively thin oceanic crust is due to a low melt production rate per\nse, for example, due to a slow-spreading rate and\/or a low mantle\ntemperature, but instead has another cause.\nFigs 2 and 15 show that the MAR in the equatorial Atlantic be-\ntween 6\u25e6N and 12\u25e6N is divided into numerous, relatively short (in\nAtlantic terms) ridge segments offset by transform faults\/fracture\nzones and shorter non-transform ridge discontinuities (Macdonald\n1982) whose orientation and existence can be traced back to the\ntime of continental break-up. Such closely spaced ridge offsets and\ntheir associated ridge tip reduced magma budgets, may also give the\nappearance of anomalously thin crust.\n7 C O N C L U S I O N S\nThe geophysical data collected over the continental margin of French\nGuiana, as part of the Amazon Cone Experiment, provide a new\ninsight into the deep structure of the crust offshore northeast South\nAmerica. Forward modelling of WA seismic data collected by 20\nocean-bottom and five land-based instruments, has resulted in a P-\nwave velocity\u2013depth model that shows the structure of pre- and post-\nrift crust and the nature and extent of the ocean\u2013continent transition,\nand which is consistent with both the coincident MCS and gravity\ndata.\nThe margin is characterized by: pre-rift continental crust 34\u2013\n37 km thick, with seismic velocities ranging from 5.6\u20136.7 km s\u22121;\nthinned continental crust in a zone \u223c70 km in width landward of the\ncontinental rise-slope transition, and in which the crust thins by a\nfactor of 6.4; an \u223c45-km-wide ocean\u2013continent transition; oceanic\ncrust, comprising two distinct layers of velocities 4.6\u20135.7 km s\u22121\nand 6.4\u20137.5 km s\u22121 and a thickness of 3.5\u20135.0 km; and, finally, a\nsediment column up to 6.4 km thick and comprising five layers con-\nsistent with the margin-wide pattern of syn- and post-rift deposition.\nThe \u223c70-km-wide zone of continental thinning distinguishes this\nmargin from pure transform margins, which commonly show thin-\nning over 10\u201340 km. However, the French Guiana margin may not\nbe characterized as an obviously normal rifted margin since there is\nno evidence of rotated faulted block, half-graben structures. In turn,\nthere is no evidence for significant rift-related magmatism, either as\nSDR sequences or as a high-velocity region within the lower crust.\nTherefore, the French Guiana margin is most likely a non-volcanic\nmargin which has experienced a component of transform\/trans-\ntensional motion as part of continental break-up.\nWe therefore conclude that the French Guiana margin displays\ncharacteristics indicative of both rifted and transform margins and\nits features are consistent with the rift-transform models of Mascle\net al. (1997) and Mascle & Blarez (1987) as applied to the Ivory\nCoast-Ghana margin in Peirce et al. (1996). Fig. 17 shows a version\nof this model developed to fit the Profile A results. This model\naccounts for both rift and transform features, a wider margin width\nthan average for transform margins and also the anomalously thin\noceanic crust observed.\nA C K N O W L E D G M E N T S\nWe wish to thank the master, officers and crew of the RRS Discovery,\ntogether with the sea-going staff of NERC\u2019s UKORS, Tom Oliva of\nSeamap UK, and Anne Krabbenho\u00a8ft and Cord Papenburg who oper-\nated the IFM-Geomar seabed instruments during the cruise.
