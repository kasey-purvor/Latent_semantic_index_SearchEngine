In order to make this argument, I will first backtrack \nsomewhat; if, as I suggest is the case, nearly everyone agrees that Man, The State and \nWar3 and Theory of International Politics are classic texts in so far as they demand \nthat anyone involved in the field must engage with them \u2013 and most also consider that \nthey are classics in so far as they set a standard of excellence in the field \u2013  then it is \nnot unreasonable to treat them in the way that we might treat works of \u2018classical\u2019 \npolitical theory, and to pose the question \u2018how are classic texts to be read\u2019?   \n \nSome post-structuralists\/deconstructionists answer this question by offering what is \nsometimes called a \u2018symptomatic reading\u2019 \u2013 the locution is that of Louis Althusser, \nthough the postmodern critic Frederic Jameson is a more accessible source.  In The \nPolitical Unconscious Jameson argues that interpretation \u201calways presupposes, if not \na conception of the unconscious itself, then at least some mechanism of mystification \nor repression in terms of which it would make sense to seek a latent meaning behind a \nmanifest one, or to rewrite the surface categories of a text in the stronger language of \na more fundamental interpretive code\u201d.4  A symptomatic reading, in other words, \npays attention to exclusions as opposed to surface content, and invites us to \nreconstruct the text to fill the gaps and silences that have been identified \u2013 an example \nis Ashley\u2019s \u2018Living on Borderlines: Man, Post-structuralism and War\u2019 which offers a \nsymptomatic reading of Man, The State and War, bringing out the ways in which the \ntext escapes the control of the author, at some points privileging \u2018man\u2019 at others \u2018the \nstate\u2019.5  There is something to be said for this approach; exclusions and omissions \nclearly are important and the author cannot be allowed to exercise authority over the \ninterpretation of a text \u2013 but, still, such a reading is always open to the charge that one \ncan make of any text whatever one wishes to.  Rather than a symptomatic reading, but \nnot wholly divorced from the idea, I would prefer to approach texts along \ncontextualist lines \u2013  that is, we must read texts in contexts; more specifically, we \nmust treat texts as speech-acts, and ask not just what the author is saying, but also \nwhat the author is doing.6  Symptoms are important here, but what this centrally \ninvolves is an attempt to recreate as far as possible the context within which the \nauthor wrote; most of all, we must not assume that an author is addressing a timeless \nset of problems, much less a set of problems that we happen to be concerned with.  \nThis is a very difficult task, for two reasons.  To illustrate the first, consider Quentin \nSkinner\u2019s work on Hobbes; a prodigious scholar with a command of the relevant \nclassical and early-modern languages which has rarely been equalled, Skinner is \n 2\nprobably familiar with everything that might have influenced Hobbes\u2019s work.  \nSkinner\u2019s scholarship explicitly reflects this reading and so can claim to place Hobbes \nin his contemporary context \u2013 by following Skinner we can, in principle, see what \nworried Hobbes and what he wanted to do with his texts.  It is impossible to imaging \nthis kind of depth of context being available to even the most learned and industrious \ncommentators on modern writers \u2013 we can do our best, but our best is bound to fall \nshort of the ideal.  \n \nBut there is a second, more intractable problem, which is perhaps best illustrated by a \nmusical analogy.  Consider the post 1945 movement towards \u2018authenticity\u2019 in \nclassical music, the attempt to recreate the conditions under which works by e.g. Bach \nand Beethoven were first performed \u2013 the use of original or replica instruments, time \nsignatures and notation of the period, smaller orchestras and choirs, different layouts, \nand, in general, original performance practice based on contemporary accounts. The \nresult of this movement has been to change quite radically what we understand by the \nperformance of, say, a Beethoven symphony or concerto \u2013 there is a great deal more \nlightness and speed than in the rather ponderous versions that used to be common, \nperiod pianofortes create a much crisper sound-world, and so on; even modern \nsymphony orchestras usually pick up some of these changes.  But what cannot be said \nis that we are hearing Beethoven\u2019s symphonies the way Beethoven\u2019s audiences would \nhave heard them.  The reason for this is quite simple \u2013 we cannot wipe out the \nauditory experiences of two hundred years by an act of will.  Musically literate \nmodern audiences will have heard Brahms, Wagner, Bruckner, Mahler et al, and even \nthose who do not frequent the concert hall will have picked up much of the musical \nlanguage of these composers via popular music (for example, the many film scores \n 3\nwritten by Mahler\u2019s pupils) and this will colour the way they hear Beethoven; there is \nno way this influence can be eliminated. \n \nThe analogy here is, I hope, clear.  Theory of International Politics was published in \n1979.   This was before: the rapid expansion of rational-choice analysis and formal \ntheory characteristic of much (US) IR of the last three decades; the framing of such \nwork in terms of \u2018neorealism\u2019 and \u2018liberal-institutionalism\u2019 in the 1980s and more \nrecent debates over relative versus absolute gains, offensive versus defensive realism, \nbalancing strategies, soft-balancing and bandwagonning; the arrival also in the 1980s \nof the so-called Third Debate, with post-structuralist theory, Frankfurt-style Critical \nTheory, Feminism and Gender Studies making an entrance; the addition of Lacanian \npsychoanalysis to the list, and the rise of multiple varieties of constructivism in the \n1990s and 2000s; the recent revival of interest in classical and Augustinian realism, \nand the Just War tradition; the attempt to establish Carl Schmitt as a canonical figure \nin IR; the emergence of debates on global distributive justice and more widely the \nemergence of international political theory as a recognisable sub-field; and, more \nparochially, the establishment of the \u2018English School\u2019 as a putatively distinctive \napproach to IR. And all this has been in the realm of theory \u2013 the end of the Cold War \nis also worthy of note.  Of course, many of these developments were stimulated by \nreadings of Waltz\u2019s work, or developed in opposition to such readings, but the \nmusical analogy holds \u2013 post-Beethovenian musical language was, one way or \nanother, heavily influenced by Beethoven\u2019s work but it still makes it impossible to \nlisten to Beethoven with early nineteenth century ears.  Similarly, how are we, in \n2008, to read Waltz\u2019s work without everything that has happened since then in the \nfield influencing our judgements? \n 4\n The question seems to answer itself; it simply is not possible to achieve the kind of \ndistance that this approach to reading a text requires \u2013 but we can at least make the \neffort, and, as it happens, I am well placed to make a shot at this task, because in 1980 \nI wrote a review essay on John Burton\u2019s Deviance Terrorism and War and Waltz\u2019s \nTheory of International Politics, which means I can at least see how I thought about \nthings then, before all the developments listed in the previous paragraph.7  Moreover, \nalthough about half of this essay is dedicated to Waltz, the main focus of the piece \nwas on Burton, and my reading of Waltz was written sine ira et studio which makes \nit, I think, a more useful document. I may have been grinding axes, but not with a \nview to cutting down the author of Theory of International Politics.  \n \nRe-reading my own text for the first time in a quarter of a century has been an \ninteresting experience. The first thing it brings to light is not strictly relevant to my \ntopic here, but of interest nonetheless, and that is the focus on the nature of structure \nin the first response to Waltz\u2019s text.  As is now almost entirely forgotten, the most \nimmediate response to Waltz\u2019s argument (which was first presented in The Handbook \nof Political Science in 1975) was a philippic from Morton Kaplan, who took serious \nexception to Waltz\u2019s critique of his conception of a \u2018system\u2019; Waltz distinguishes \nbetween the systems level properly conceptualised, and the level of interacting units, \nand accused Kaplan of failing to grasp this distinction in his famous text System and \nProcess in International Politics.8  To my mind, and, given my interest at the time in \nstructuralist and neo-Marxist theories of international relations, this was an important \nissue to me, Waltz had much the better of this debate, but was vulnerable to the \ncharge that his version of structure was no more capable of showing how structure \n 5\nwas transmuted into process than Kaplan\u2019s.  To make this point I refer in the review \nto the Marxist literature on the subject, and E.P. Thompson\u2019s recent critique of Louis \nAlthusser, The Poverty of Theory;9 Thompson suggests the need for \u2018junction \nconcepts\u2019 and lays great stress on the notion of \u2018experience\u2019 \u2013 all this has quite a bit of \nresonance in terms of later constructivist thought, the agent-structure debate and, \nmore recently, of critical realist theory;  interestingly, Ashley would also use \nThompson\u2019s work in his critique of \u2018the poverty of neorealism\u2019 in his 1984 \nInternational Organization article. \n \nMore to the point of this essay is the way in which in 1980 I understood Waltz\u2019s \nrelationship with past realist writers.  The simple answer is that I identified no great \ndiscontinuity here.  Due attention is paid, of course, to the fact that Waltz presents his \nargument via a Popperian account of scientific method that certainly was not to be \nfound in the classic texts of realism, and that he draws a distinction between \nreductionist and systemic theories that is somewhat different from that employed by \nthose texts, insofar as they employ such a distinction at all, but these points of \ndifference are outweighed by the substantial similarities between his overall \nconception of the world and that of the classics.  He presents a strong and \nsophisticated account of the working assumption that states are unitary actors, a \n\u2018masterly\u2019 critique of theories of interdependence (and it is indeed masterly I should \nadd, still very much worth reading \u2013 especially if you substitute \u2018globalisation\u2019 for \n\u2018interdependence\u2019 when the term appears in the text), and a subtle discussion of the \nbalance of power \u2013 all key issues for the classical realists.  Hence my judgement then \nthat Waltz remains firmly in the \u2018conventional mainstream\u2019 of realist thought. \n \n 6\nSo many people have subsequently disagreed with this assessment that an element of \nauto-critique may be called for here.  In my review I picked up Waltz\u2019s use of the \nterminology of a self-help system and his use of economic models, and I critiqued his \nassumption that he was producing explanatory (as opposed to \u2018metaphysical\u2019) theory \n\u2013 but I did not anticipate that these positions would transmute into the rational-choice \nversions of neorealism subsequently popular, that the behaviour of egoistic actors \nunder anarchy (the \u2018anarchy problematic\u2019) would be studied by the use of increasingly \ncomplex econometric models.  In my defence, I suspect Waltz himself did not \nanticipate this denouement \u2013 later statements and interviews suggests as much. 10  \n \nStill, even accepting that there are elements of the argument I didn\u2019t pick up then, it \nstill seems there is a big gap between my take on Waltz\u2019s position in 1980, and its \nlater reception.  How is this gap to be explained?  In two ways, I think, one a matter of \nrhetoric, the other a matter of substance.  The rhetorical points concern, first, the way \nin which authors present themselves, and, second, the way in which they critique \nothers.  As to the first point, there is a basic divide to be seen in academic \nargumentation between those who in their own work stress continuity and those who \nstress rupture.  In practice, we all stand on the shoulders of giants, as did the giants \nthemselves and there is always a degree of continuity between even the most \ninnovative work and past efforts in the field \u2013 the difference is whether, and to what \ndegree, any particular writer is moved to acknowledge that link.  Waltz in Theory of \nInternational Politics is closer to the latter camp than the former; he does not make \npositive claims for great originality, but neither does he emphasise the links between \nhis work and that of earlier realists (as we will see below, Man, the State and War is a \ndifferent kind of book, and there the problem is rather of discerning when Waltz is \n 7\nspeaking in his own voice, and when he is reporting the work of others).  There is an \ninteresting contrast here with, say Robert Gilpin, whose response to being identified \nas a neorealist by Richard Ashley was to deny vigorously the charge, stressing the \nway in which he represents the rich tradition of political realism.11  In the same \ncollection Robert Keohane suggests that Waltz  \u2018[reformulates] and systematizes \nRealism, and thus develops what I have called Structural Realism, consistently with \nthe fundamental assumptions of his classical predecessors\u2019,12  but, in his own \nresponse, Waltz simply does not address the issue of continuity with the past; he notes \nRichard Ashley\u2019s charge that \u2018[older] realists, despite some limitations, set a high \nstandard of political reasoning from which I and other neorealists have regressed\u2019, and \nhe notes Keohane\u2019s position cited above, but responds directly to neither charge.13  \nInstead he simply sets out in detail and defends his original arguments. \n \nThis insouciance is, in many ways, admirable, but it does help critics to make the \npoint that his work represents a clear break with the past, if they wish to do so \u2013 and \nthey often will, because this leads into the second rhetorical point about the way in \nwhich academics criticise each other.  A very familiar ploy here is the one Waltz \nnotes in his comment on Ashley.  In order to undermine the position of an author with \nwhom one disagrees quite profoundly, it is helpful to be able to make the case that \ntheir position does not simply contradict one\u2019s own but also that of some \nacknowledged past masters within the author\u2019s own discourse.  In effect, the ploy is to \ntry to use people who would have been your enemies in the past to combat someone \nwho is your enemy in the present.  These figures from the past are praised for their \nsagacity in order to belittle the present foe. \n \n 8\nIn fact, of course, this is usually little more than a rhetorical trick.  For example, \nAshley refers favourably to E.H. Carr in the aforementioned essay as an example of \nsomeone who was steeped in the diplomatic culture of the past and who exhibited \nsuperior wisdom and judgement to Waltz, who has remained pretty firmly ensconced \nin the world of the academy.  Actually, one cannot help feeling that Carr would have \nhad very little time for the kind of post-structuralist work favoured by his admirer, \nand as to Carr\u2019s allegedly superior judgement, I suppose support for the appeasement \nof Hitler before 1939, and of  Stalin after 1945, could be described in those terms, but \nnot by me \u2013 but this is beside the point, because Ashley\u2019s invocation of Carr has very \nlittle to do with Carr\u2019s work and everything to do with using him as a stick to beat \nWaltz with.  Waltz spoils the game slightly by not responding, but the very lack of a \nresponse does feed the predispositions of those who want to see him as instituting a \nrupture with the past. \n \nBut, although this is part of the story, it is only part of the story \u2013 there is another \nreason why Waltz\u2019s work is seem as instituting a serious break with the past and that \nconcerns the much wider issue of how that past is understood.  What actually are the \nroots of realism, and is Waltz\u2019s structuralist account actually out of line with those \nroots? The rest of this chapter is devoted to this question, and, as will become \napparent, the matter hinges on an  examination of the role of human nature in classical \nrealist thought.  The argument for a rupture between Waltzian neorealism and \nclassical realism rests partly on the proposition that human nature plays less of a role \nfor Waltz than it does for the classics \u2013 I want to suggest that while this is indeed the \ncase, the way in which Waltz handles the issue of human nature can be related to both \n 9\nthe major strands of realist thought, although, at the same time, it is distanced from \nthem. \n \nWaltz, Human Nature and the Roots of Realism \n \nThe central problem for those who wish to argue against the discontinuity thesis is \nsimply stated.  Waltz is absolutely clear that what he is presenting is a theory of the \ninternational system, and that theories based on other levels, the individual or the \nstate, that is, \u2018reductionist\u2019 theories, are profoundly unsatisfactory \u2013 but, on the face of \nit, most of the authors who are usually seen as the key figures in a genealogy of \nrealism offer precisely such theories. The Machiavellian tradition of raison d\u2019\u00e9tat is \nessentially based on a theory about the conduct of foreign policy and rests on a \nparticular conception of what human beings are like; the Hobbesian account of an \ninternational \u2018state of nature\u2019 again rests explicitly on an anthropology, as the \nstructure of Leviathan makes very clear; the Augustinian roots of Niebuhr\u2019s (and \nperhaps Morgenthau\u2019s) realism are firmly embedded in the notion of original sin and \nfallen man.14   \n \nCertainly one can find \u2018structuralist\u2019 positions in classical authors.  Thucydides is an \ninteresting case here.  At the beginning of his history he states that the truest cause of \nthe war whose story he is about to tell is \u2018the one least openly expressed, that \nincreasing Athenian greatness and the resulting fear among the Lacedaemonians made \ngoing to war inevitable\u2019 which sounds like a clear structuralist argument (indeed an \nembryonic statement of the security dilemma).15  He makes the structuralist case more \nexplicitly later in the text when he puts into the mouths of the Athenian representative \n 10\nthe proposition that they were compelled to expand their empire by necessity, and that \nthe Spartans would have done the same had they been in a similar situation \u2013 the \nAthenian speech here is a nice early statement of the tenets of \u2018offensive realism\u2019. 16  \n \nWaltz understandably cites these and similar passages in Thucydides \u2013 the problem is \none can find with equal ease statements in the same source which put the real driving \nforce behind the war elsewhere.  In the same speech cited above, the Athenians state, \n[we] have done nothing remarkable, nor contrary to ordinary human \nbehaviour, if we not only accepted an empire when it was offered but also did \nnot let it go, submitting to the great forces of prestige, fear and self-interest \u2013 \nnot as the originators of such conduct, moreover, since the rule has always \nexisted that the weaker is held down by the stronger\u202617\nLater, the Athenians make the same point in the \u2018Melian Dialogue\u2019. \nAccording to our understanding, divinity, it would seem, and mankind, as has \nalways been obvious, are under an innate compulsion to rule whenever \nempowered.18\nHuman nature is the driving force, to which individuals and peoples must submit, are \nunder an innate compulsion.   \n \nThe other classical writer favoured by structural realists is Rousseau, whose parable \nof the stag hunt is a staple for students of rational choice and the logic (and dilemmas) \nof collective action.  Thus.. \nIf it was a matter of hunting a deer, everyone well realized that he must remain \nfaithfully at his post; but if a hare happened to pass within the reach of one of \nthem, we cannot doubt that he would have gone off in pursuit of it without \n 11\nscruple and, having caught his own prey, he would have cared very little about \nhaving caused his companions to lose theirs. 19\nThis is frequently used to illustrate the imperatives of a self-help system; \u2018everyone\u2019 \nwould behave in this way because everyone would behave in this way \u2013 in other \nwords we have to assume that if we don\u2019t chase the hare someone else will, or if we \nare the only person who has seen the hare and so this does not apply, we have to \nassume that there may be another hare which someone else will see and chase and so \non.  Either way the stag will be lost and we will go hungry, so we had better act now.  \nBut, again, it is the assumptions that Rousseau makes about human nature that do the \nwork in this case; it is because human beings are unscrupulous in the pursuit of their \nown interests, and have little concern for the interests of others that they act in this \nway. 20\n \nIn short, both Thucydides and Rousseau are ultimately offering first-image accounts \nof the motor of realism \u2013 and they are the best friends Waltz can find within the \nclassical literature on the subject.  For Augustine and the Augustinians, ancient and \nmodern, political leaders are obliged to operate in a fallen world \u2013 the city of man as \nopposed to the city of God \u2013 and therefore must be wise and prudential (also, it is to \nbe hoped, just) wielders of power, and this has nothing to do with structural features \nof the international politics of late antiquity (or the early 21st century); for Augustine, \nthe hierarchical polity that was collapsing around his ears was as much a context as \nthe incipient anarchical system being created by the barbarian tribes who were \noverrunning the Empire.21 Again, Machiavelli simply takes it for granted that politics \nis about the pursuit of interests; thus, the unstated assumption is that the Duke \nValentino seeks to extend his power simply because he can \u2013 no further explanation is \n 12\nrequired \u2013 and if you want to preserve your power, or that of the city, (The Prince) or \nto preserve republican forms of government (The Discourses) you had better be aware \nthat this is the way of the world. \n \nWithout labouring the point further, I suggest a key feature of Waltz\u2019s thought and \none that genuinely distinguishes it from classical realism, is that his theory of \ninternational politics is not derived from a theory of human nature, or even explicitly \nin reaction to a theory of human nature \u2013 indeed \u2018human nature\u2019 does not even appear \nin the index of Theory of International Politics. In Man, the State and War, of course, \nit does appear but of the three images set out therein, the first two (\u2018man\u2019 and \u2018the \nstate\u2019) are collapsed into one category in Theory of International Politics, \n\u2018reductionism\u2019. Interestingly, when he wants to illustrate the follies of this way of \nthinking, it is to a theory of foreign policy (Lenin\u2019s theory of imperialism) that he \nturns, and not to a theory of human nature.  Why so?  \n \nFor the answer to this question we have to examine the complex picture of human \nnature actually presented in Man, the State and War.  This is not as easy as it might be \nthought to be, because \u2013 unlike Theory of International Politics \u2013 this is a book that is \nbuilt round a series of interlocking debates between different authors, classical and \nmodern, and it is not always as clear as it might be what Waltz himself thinks on the \nsubject.  So, for example, at the outset of  Man, the State and War we have the bald \nstatement \u2018[our] miseries are ineluctably the product of our natures. The root of all \nevil is man, and thus he himself is the root of the specific evil, war\u2019 (p.3) which \nFreyberg-Inan in her generally excellent book on realism and human nature takes to \nbe an expression of Waltz\u2019s own view; she comments, correctly, that in this he sounds \n 13\nlike St Augustine.22  The problem is that while Waltz may indeed endorse this \nposition, it actually occurs in the course of a discussion of precisely the Augustinian \nperspective that it is supposed to resemble, and it could well be (probably is) simply a \nsummary of that position.  If it is Waltz\u2019s view then the use of the term evil is \ninteresting here, adding an unexpected theological dimension to what is otherwise, as \nnoted above, a frequently expressed realist position, but, in any event, what is more \nsignificant is that it is clear from the rest of the book that Waltz believes that this sort \nof generalisation about human nature actually gets us nowhere, and a different kind of \nexplanation for war is needed.  Why? Given the general thrust of his argument \nelsewhere, one might have expected him to argue that because human nature is a \nconstant it cannot explain war; war is the product of a particular set of social \narrangements and must be understood in that context, reductionist theories will not do, \nand so we must move to the third image.  Had he taken such a route he would have \naligned himself with those realist writers who emphasise an unchanging human nature \n(Thucydides, Machiavelli and Hobbes) even if, unlike those predecessors, he doesn\u2019t \nthink that ultimately this nature matters very much. \n \nBut, it seems, that this is actually not why he moves away from human nature.  \nRather, it is first, because, in any scientific sense, the content of human nature is \nunknowable, but second, and more important, it is because, contra the position \noutlined above, human nature is actually a variable, not a constant.  Thus, \u2018[Because] \nof the difficulty of knowing such a thing as a pure human nature, because the human \nnature we do know reflects both man\u2019s nature and the influence of his environment, \ndefinitions of human nature such as those of Spinoza and Hobbes are arbitrary and \ncan lead to no valid social or political conclusions.\u2019 (p.166) 23  Here Waltz is \n 14\ndiscussing the critique of these accounts of human nature allegedly put forward by \nMontesquieu and Rousseau, but it is, I think, clear from the context that he is \nendorsing this position.24 Reconstructing and rearranging his argument, it seems to be \nthat while we humans do indeed have a nature, and, perhaps, judging from the \nexistence of evil in the world, that nature is such that sometimes evil consequences \nflow from it, we can\u2019t actually specify this nature much beyond that, at least not in \nany scientific way, and, in any event, in practice, nature and nurture cannot be treated \nseparately; therefore an emphasis on human nature gets us nowhere if we want to \nunderstand social phenomena.   \n \nThis is quite a complex position, which touches base with the major strands of \nclassical realist thought, but at a tangent.  The initial emphasis on evil, if it were to be \nthe case that this is indeed his emphasis, would link Waltz to the \u2018righteous realists\u2019, \nthe Augustinian strand of thought identified by Joel Rosenthal, Alastair Murray and \nothers.25  But the Augustinians actually draw political conclusions from this position; \ntheir realism is a realism of prudence, where we are enjoined to question our own \npresuppositions and values (because we are fallen beings every bit as much as are our \nenemies), and to turn away from ambitious projects of social reform, which are \ndoomed to failure because of the imperfect human material from which societies are \nconstructed \u2013 human beings may strive to be moral (although, for Augustine, they can \nonly achieve this status by God\u2019s grace, not by their own efforts), but collectivities \nwill always be egoistic.26 There is, I suspect, little here with which in practice Waltz \nwould disagree (which is one of the reasons why Freyberg-Inan might be right in \nassigning the \u2018evil\u2019 statement to him) but he does not get to this position by the \nAugustinian route, even if he has the same starting point.  From his perspective, and \n 15\ngiven his commitment to social science, and to a particular version of what social \nscience involves, the Augustinian route leads into a dead end.  In the terminology of \nTheory of International Politics this is metaphysics and he, Waltz, is engaged in \nscience.  One cannot build a model on this kind of foundation, even if the foundation \nis, in some sense, sound; Augustinian realism does not generate testable hypotheses \nand ultimately it remains a branch of belles-lettres.  From a Waltzian perspective this \nis also, I think, the problem with Morgenthau\u2019s theory \u2013 Morgenthau wants to be \nobjective and present scientific laws of politics, but his metaphysical commitments \nget in the way, although, for many, of course, it is Morgenthau\u2019s so-called \n\u2018metaphysics\u2019, his critique of positivism, as set out in e.g. Scientific Man vs. Power \nPolitics that is his most attractive feature.27  In short, Waltz is not an Augustinian \nrealist, even if he shares some of the pessimism characteristic of that genre. \n \nNeither does he follow Hobbes, Spinoza, Machiavelli et al by rooting his theory in the \ndrives produced by an unchanging human nature. But, again, there are points of \ncontact with this strand of realism; he may not see human nature as constant, but he \ndoes, I think, share with these authors the view that the interests of states, which are \nultimately generated by human nature, are, more or less, constant \u2013 the difference \nbeing that from his perspective these interests have to be seen as exogenous to a \ntheory of the international system.  States desire to survive and it is this desire which \nleads them to arms-race, or form balances or whatever; we don\u2019t need to ask why \nstates desire to survive, they just do.  From his perspective, to push the question \nfurther takes us into areas which it is not reasonable to expect a theory of the \ninternational system to be concerned with.  It is this approach to interests \u2013 as constant \nbut exogenous \u2013 which has dominated the thought of the \u2018rational choice realists\u2019 who \n 16\nhave built on Waltz\u2019s work to construct modern neorealism by redefining the field as \nthe study of how egoists pursue their exogenously given interests under conditions of \nanarchy\u2013 and indeed of their cousins, the liberal institutionalists who have offered a \ndifferent reading of the possibilities of the anarchy problematic, but take the same \nview of interests, (or \u2018preferences\u2019 as Andrew Moravcsik would have it).28  And, of \ncourse, it is this position that has been so effectively criticised by constructivist \nwriters such as Friedrich Kratochwil and Harald M\u00fcller;29 values and interests should \nnot be taken as given but must be understood as produced in discourse, that is, \nproduced in a relationship \u2013 as Kratochwil puts it, one root of the word \u2018interest\u2019 is \n\u2018inter-esse\u2019, \u2018 the in-between of the me and the you\u2019.30  On this account, it simply \nisn\u2019t possible to produce a theory of international politics that is isolated from other \nlevels of social and inter-personal interaction. \n \nStill, without remotely wishing to suggest that Waltz is a proto-constructivist, it seems \nto me that there are elements of his thinking that would be rather more compatible \nwith this critique than one might expect; the aspects of the work of the neorealists and \nliberal institutionalists criticised by Kratochwil actually owe more to the Hobbesian \naccount of human nature than they do to the more nuanced story that Waltz has to tell.  \nIndeed, when Waltz writes of man\u2019s nature interacting with his environment, one \ncould almost imagine this thought being developed in the direction of Alexander \nWendt\u2019s account of the different kinds of anarchy that might emerge in different kinds \nof environments31 \u2013 but, of course, Waltz does not wish to go anywhere near that \nposition, rejecting altogether any this line of thought that relies on human nature. The \npoint is that he excludes human nature because we can\u2019t (or at least don\u2019t) understand \nit, whereas the rational choice realists treat it as an exogenous variable because they \n 17\nbelieve that they do understand it, and that it generates interests the nature of which \ncan simply be taken for granted.  But, on the other hand, for Waltz although we can\u2019t \n(or at least don\u2019t) understand human nature, we do at least know that it is quite likely \nthat \u2018our miseries are the product of our natures\u2019, which takes us back to Augustinian \npessimism and away from both the rational choice realists and the constructivists.  \nWaltz\u2019s thought seems to oscillate between the Hobbesian and Augustinian poles, \ntouching both while refusing to be identified with either.  \n \nHere, I suggest, is perhaps the most important, and certainly the most paradoxical, \nreason why Waltz is so difficult to relate to the roots of  realism; it is not because he is \ntotally separated from those roots, but because he is actually implicated in too many \nof them.  Whereas we can settle for a Weberian (modified Nietzschean) reading of \nMorgenthau and, I would argue, perhaps controversially, a Hobbesian (out of Marx \nand Mannheim) reading of Carr, no such shorthand is available to us to summarise \nWaltz\u2019s position.  Easiest simply to say that there is a rupture here, that Waltz really is \nthe inventor of something called \u2018neorealism\u2019, a doctrine which has lost touch with \npast realist thought.  Easiest perhaps, but inaccurate I think \u2013 better would be to say \nthat finding a shorthand reading of Waltz that relates to the realist past is difficult \nbecause there is too much to say rather than too little. \n \nReturning to the issue of human nature, so far I have tried to describe Waltz\u2019s position \n\u2013 but some degree of assessment of that position is also called for.  Was he right to \nsee human nature as essentially unknowable, and variable in its impact? When Waltz \nwas developing his thoughts on structural realism in the 1970s, human socio-biology \nwas in its infancy, and the first serious attempt by a scholar to talk about human \n 18\nnature in a scientifically defensible way \u2013 Edward O. Wilson\u2019s Sociobiology: The \nNew Synthesis  \u2013 was as unpopular with biologists as it was with sociologists and \nanthropologists, and gave no reason for Waltz to change his judgement that there was \nnothing useful that a social scientist could say about the subject. 32 Indeed, the most \ntrenchant critique of the scientific pretentions of socio-biology, by Marshall Sahlins, \nrejected the discourse on roughly the same, Durkheimian, grounds offered by Waltz \nfor rejecting other kinds of \u2018reductionist theories.33  Since the 1970s, however, socio-\nbiology, rebranded as \u2018evolutionary psychology\u2019, has developed in ways that are far \nremoved from the simplicities of Wilson\u2019s work, and now, I believe, demands to be \ntaken seriously.34  Moreover, neuroscientists such as V. S.  Ramachandran and \nAntonio Damasio are revealing ways in which human perceptions and behaviours are \ncrucially shaped and determined by physical processes within the brain.35  And, to \ncomplete the picture, many cultural anthropologists are now rejecting the politically-\ncorrect relativism of their disciplinary forebears \u2013 perhaps rather disappointingly, it \nturns out that the \u2018coming of age on Samoa\u2019 was more or less like the coming of age \neverywhere else, and Donald Brown has proved that one can write a very substantial \nbook full of \u2018human universals\u2019.36  Add all this material together and although we \nmay not know of such a thing as a \u2018pure human nature\u2019, we (that is, the scientific \ncommunity, broadly drawn) do know a lot more about the subject than we did thirty \nyears ago. Does this have any implications for Waltz\u2019s position? \n \nScholars of international relations have been slow in coming to terms with this \nmaterial, and probably the best-known work, by Bradley Thayer, is broadly \nsupportive of rational-choice, game theoretic approaches.37  More recent work, \nhowever, focuses on the ways in which choices are made that are not utility \n 19\nmaximising.38  The results here are rather sobering; for example, there is good \nevidence that mentally healthy people tend to exhibit psychological biases that \nencourage optimism; such biases, known to evolutionary psychologists as \u2018positive \nillusions\u2019, may well have been adaptive in helping our ancestors to cope with hard \ntimes, but nowadays may serve instead to get us into trouble.39  \n \nIt would be difficult to overestimate the importance of this work for international \npolitical theory, and I hope to write more extensively on this topic in the future, but \nobviously, any serious assessment would take us far beyond the scope of this \nparticular article \u2013 still, it is interesting to ask whether, if it is indeed the case that we \ncan now say rather more about human nature than we could in the 1970s, as I think it \nis, does what we can now say actually support the position Waltz\u2019s took in Theory of \nInternational Politics?  Was Waltz right to resist basing his theory on human nature?  \nThe answer, I think, is a tentative yes.  Scientific work in this field has indeed \nidentified biases in judgement some of which are relevant to any theory of foreign \npolicy behaviour \u2013 but, of course, Waltz had no intention of producing such a theory.  \nAt the macro level where he was working, the most relevant finding of the new \nlearning is rather different.  It is precisely that while there may be identifiable human \nbehavioural biases and mechanisms that are the product of evolution and are constant \nacross cultures and over time, the idea that human nature as such is a constant is not \ndefensible.  In the study quoted above, \u2018positive illusions\u2019 were present generally in \nall populations, but they varied in intensity as between individuals; mental states are \nimportant and, unsurprisingly, depressed people were less likely to have positive \nillusions that mentally healthy people; context is central \u2013 positive illusions are \ngreater, for example, \u2018in situations of ambiguity, low feedback, and where events are \n 20\ndifficult to verify\u2019; culture matters, \u2018positive illusions are greater among Western \n(especially American) populations than Eastern populations\u2019 (we might have guessed \nthat one as well) and, finally, they vary according to regime type and decision making \nprocess.40 The point is that it is precisely because of these variations that it is possible \nto put together a theory which is intended to predict when positive illusions will be \nimportant \u2013 this is the goal of Dominic Johnson\u2019s recent book.41  If there were to be \nsuch a thing as a constant \u2018human nature\u2019 it could not be the basis for theory, which is \nprecisely why Waltz was right not to construct his theory on such foundations, even if \nthis meant that, in this respect, he had to part company with his illustrious forebears. \n \nSo, to return to the starting point of this chapter, how then should we read Waltz \u2013 as \none in a line of realist theorists whose work is consistent with the \u2018fundamental \nassumptions of his classical predecessors\u2019 or as a figure who has broken with the \npast?  The answer is \u2018both and\u2019 rather than \u2018either or\u2019.  It is impossible to find any \nfigure amongst the classics who puts things together in the same way that Waltz does, \nbut most of the things that are put together by Waltz would be familiar to most \nclassical writers.  And this ability to take familiar material and to combine and \nrecombine it is precisely why Waltz is an undisputed modern classic.   \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1 Kenneth Waltz, Theory of International Politics (Reading MA: Addison-Wesley, \n1979).
