We define a notion of a Dade group of a fusion system and show that some of the\ngluing and detection results for Dade groups of finite p-groups due to Bouc and The\u00b4venaz in [8],\n[9] extend to Dade groups of fusion systems.\n1. Introduction\nThe Dade group D(P,F) of a fusion system F on a finite p-group P , for p a prime, is defined as\nthe subgroup of F-stable elements in the Dade group D(P ) of P . The motivation for considering\nthis notion comes from block theory: any choice of a maximal b-Brauer pair (P, e) of a block b of a\nfinite group G over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p determines a fusion system F\non P - see e.g. [16] for details. Moreover, for any subgroup Q of P there is by [1] a unique block eQ\nof kCG(Q) such that (Q, eQ) \u2286 (P, e). Then, for any pair (R,Q) of subgroups of Q, R of P such\nthat Q is normal in R and such that the block eQ is a nilpotent block in the sense of [3], the unique\n(up to isomorphism) simple kCG(Q)eQ-module VQ becomes an endo-permutation kR\/Q-module.\nIn this way, any block gives rise to a fusion compatible family of endo-permutation modules for\nall sections R\/Q of P for which the block eQ is nilpotent. One of the questions, first raised by\nPuig in [21], is whether this family can be \u201cglued together\u201d to an endo-permutation kP -module\nV such that DefresPR\/Q(V ) is equal to VQ in the Dade group D(R\/Q) for any section R\/Q of P\nas above. Following [21], this gluing problem has an affirmative answer if P is abelian, which in\nturn is used to show the existence of a stable equivalence of Morita type between the block and\nits Brauer correspondent under the assumption that the inertial quotient acts freely on the non\ntrivial elements of P . In [8], Bouc and The\u00b4venaz gave a more general criterion for when the gluing\nproblem has a solution provided that the involved endo-permutation modules are torsion in their\nrespective Dade groups and p is an odd prime. The purpose of the present paper is to investigate\ncompatibility issues with respect to an arbitrary fusion system F on a finite p-group P . After a\nbrief review on fusion systems in \u00a72, we define in \u00a73 the Dade group D(P,F) of a fusion system\nF on a finite p-group P and relate this to the definition of endo-p-permutation modules, due to\nUrfer [24]. In \u00a74 and \u00a75, we extend some results of Bouc and The\u00b4venaz [8], [9] to this context, and\nin \u00a76, we describe some examples of Dade groups of fusion systems.\n2. Generalities on fusion systems\nWe review the definition of a fusion system, a concept due to Puig [19]. Our terminology\nfollows [2] or [17].\nDate: December 3, 2008.\nResearch of the second author was supported by Swiss National Research Fellowship PA002-113164\/1.\n1\n2 MARKUS LINCKELMANN AND NADIA MAZZA\nDefinition 2.1. Let P be a finite p-group. A fusion system on P is a category F having as objects\nthe subgroups of P ; for any two subgroups Q, R of P the morphism set HomF (Q,R) is a set of\ninjective group homomorphisms with the following properties:\n(1) composition of morphisms in F is the usual composition of group homomorphisms;\n(2) if \u03d5 : Q\u2192 R is a morphism in F then so is the induced isomorphism Q \u223c= \u03d5(Q) as well as\nits inverse;\n(3) HomF (Q,R) contains the set HomP (Q,R) of group homomorphisms \u03d5 : Q\u2192 R for which\nthere exists an element y \u2208 P satisfying \u03d5(u) = yuy\u22121 for all u \u2208 Q;\n(4) (I-S) if |NP (Q)| \u2265 |NP (\u03d5(Q))| for any \u03d5 \u2208 HomF (Q,P ) then AutP (Q) is a Sylow p-\nsubgroup of AutF (Q);\n(5) (II-S) if \u03d5 : Q \u2192 P is a morphism in F such that |NP (\u03d5(Q))| \u2265 |NP (\u03c4(Q))| for any\n\u03c4 \u2208 HomF (Q,P ) then \u03d5 extends to a morphism \u03c8 : N\u03d5 \u2192 P in F where N\u03d5 is the\nsubgroup of NP (Q) consisting of all y \u2208 NP (Q) for which there exists z \u2208 NP (\u03d5(Q)) with\nthe property \u03d5(yuy\u22121) = z\u03d5(u)z\u22121 for all u \u2208 Q.\nGiven a fusion system F on a finite p-group P , a subgroup Q of P is called fully F-normalised\nif |NP (Q)| \u2265 |NP (\u03d5(Q))| for any \u03d5 \u2208 HomF (Q,P ); similarly, Q is called fully F-centralised\nif |CP (Q)| \u2265 |CP (\u03d5(Q))| for any \u03d5 \u2208 HomF (Q,P ). A subgroup Q of P is called F-centric\nif CP (\u03d5(Q)) = Z(\u03d5(Q)) for any \u03d5 \u2208 HomF (Q,P ), and Q is called F-radical if AutQ(Q) =\nOp(AutF (Q)), the largest normal p-subgroup of AutF (Q). A subgroup Q of P is called F-essential\nif Q is F-centric and if the partially ordered set of non-trivial p-subgroups of AutF (Q)\/AutQ(Q)\nis not connected. If Q is F-essential then Q is F-centric radical. Alperin\u2019s fusion theorem implies\nthat F is generated by the automorphism groups AutF (Q) of F-essential subgroups Q of P . Fol-\nlowing Stancu [23], the axioms (I-S) and (II-S) imply the a priori stronger axioms used in work of\nBroto-Levi-Oliver [2], where fusion systems are called saturated fusion systems.\nRemark 2.2. Let G be a finite group. For any two subgroups Q, R of G denote by HomG(Q,R)\nthe set of injective group homomorphisms \u03d5 : Q \u2192 R for which there exists an element x \u2208 G\nsatisfying \u03d5(u) = xux\u22121 for all u \u2208 Q. Let p be a prime and let P be a Sylow p-subgroup of\nG. The fusion system of G on P is the category denoted by FP (G) having the subgroups of P\nas objects and the sets HomG(Q,R) as morphism sets, for any two subgroups Q, R of G. The\ncategory FP (G) is a fusion system on P in the sense of the definition 2.1. Axiom (3) of that\ndefinition implies that any fusion system F on P contains the \u201ctrivial\u201d fusion system FP (P ) of P\non itself.\nProposition 2.3. [2, Proposition 2.5] Let F be a fusion system on a finite p-group P . There is\na finite P -P -biset X with the following properties:\n(1) Every transitive P -P -subbiset of X is of the form PQ\u00d7\u03d5P for some subgroup Q of P and\nsome \u03d5 \u2208 HomF (Q,P ).\n(2) |X||P | is congruent to 1 modulo p.\n(3) For any subgroup Q of P and any \u03d5 : Q \u2192 P we have an isomorphism of Q-P -bisets\n\u03d5X \u223c= QX and an isomorphism of P -Q-bisets X\u03d5 \u223c= XQ.\nHere PQ\u00d7\u03d5P is the P -P -biset of equivalence classes in P \u00d7 P with respect to the equivalence\nrelation (yu, z) \u223c (y, \u03d5(u)z), where y, z \u2208 P and u \u2208 Q, and \u03d5X is the Q-P -biset equal to X as\nTHE DADE GROUP OF A FUSION SYSTEM 3\nright P -set with u \u2208 Q acting on x \u2208 X, as \u03d5(u)x; similarly for X\u03d5. Note that P acts freely on\nthe left and on the right of a biset X as in Proposition 2.3.\n3. The Dade group of a fusion system\nLet P be a finite p-group and let k be a field of characteristic p. Following Dade [13], a kP -\nmodule M is called an endo-permutation kP -module if Endk(M) \u223c= M \u2297k M\u2217 is a permutation\nkP -module. Here M\u2217 = Homk(M,k) denotes the k-dual of M . Furthermore, M is called an\nendotrivial kP -module if Endk(M) \u223c= k \u2295 Y for some projective kP -module Y .\nGiven an endo-permutation kP -module M , its restriction ResPQ(M) to any subgroup Q of P\nhas at most one isomorphism class of indecomposable direct summands with Q as vertex. In\nparticular, M itself has at most one isomorphism class of indecomposable direct summands with\nP as vertex, and any such summand is then called a cap of M . If M has a cap we say that M\nis capped. Note that M is capped if and only if Endk(M) has a trivial direct summand as kP -\nmodule. In particular, any endotrivial kP -module is a capped endo-permutation kP -module. More\nprecisely, an endotrivial kP -module restricts to any subgroup Q of P as the direct sum of one\nindecomposable endotrivial kQ-module and a projective kQ-module. If M , N are capped endo-\npermutation kP -modules then so is their tensor product M \u2297k N . Two capped endo-permutation\nkP -modules M , N are called equivalent if their caps are isomorphic. The Dade group of P is the\ngroup of equivalence classes of capped endo-permutation kP -modules, with product induced by\nthe tensor product over k. The inverse of the class of a capped endo-permutation kP -module M in\nthis group is the class of its k-dual M\u2217. The Dade group D(P ) is a finitely generated abelian group\n(cf. [20]). The equivalence classes whose cap is endotrivial form a subgroup of D(P ), denoted by\nT (P ). Note that two endotrivial kP -modules are equivalent if and only if they are isomorphic in\nthe stable module category of kP -modules. The Dade group is contravariant functorial in P . If P\nand Q are two finite p-groups and \u03d5 : Q \u2192 P is a group homomorphism, we denote for any kP -\nmodule M by Res\u03d5(M), or sometimes simply by varphiM , the kQ-module which is equal to M as\nk-vector space, with u \u2208 Q acting on m \u2208M by \u03d5(u)m. Restriction along \u03d5 defines in this way an\nexact functor Res\u03d5 : mod(kP )\u2192mod(kQ). If M is a capped endo-permutation kP -module then\nRes\u03d5(M) is a capped endo-permutation kQ-module, and hence the functor Res\u03d5 induces a group\nhomomorphism between the corresponding Dade groups, still denoted by Res\u03d5 : D(P ) \u2192 D(Q).\nThis map sends T (P ) to T (Q) and the torsion subgroup Dt(P ) of D(P ) to the torsion subgroup\nDt(Q) of D(Q). If \u03d5 is the inclusion morphism of a subgroup Q of P we write ResPQ instead of\nRes\u03d5. We refer the reader to [7] for more background material and other usual notation concerning\nthe Dade group. In particular, a section of a finite p-group P is a pair (T, S) of subgroups of P\nsuch that S E T \u2264 P . If R \u2264 S E T \u2264 P , with R E P , we write\nDefresP\/RT\/S = Def\nT\/R\nT\/S \u25e6ResP\/RT\/R and TeninfP\/RT\/S = TenP\/RT\/R \u25e6 InfT\/RT\/S .\nAs before, we use this notation for elements of the Dade group as well as for modules.\nDefinition 3.1. Let P be a finite p-group and let F be a fusion system on P . The Dade\ngroup D(P,F) of (P,F) is the abelian group\nD(P,F) = lim\u2190\u2212F\nD ,\nwhere D denotes the contravariant functor from F to the category of abelian groups sending\na subgroup Q of P to the Dade group D(Q) and a morphism \u03d5 : Q \u2192 R in F to the group\n4 MARKUS LINCKELMANN AND NADIA MAZZA\nhomomorphism Res\u03d5 : D(R)\u2192 D(Q). Similarly, we define\nT (P,F) = lim\u2190\u2212F\nT ,\nDt(P,F) = lim\u2190\u2212F\nDt ,\nwhere T and Dt are the subfunctors of D sending a subgroup Q of P to T (Q) and Dt(Q),\nrespectively.\nRemark 3.2. We usually identify D(P,F) with a subgroup of D(P ). With this identification, we\nhave T (P,F) = T (P )\u2229D(P,F) and Dt(P,F) = Dt(P )\u2229D(P,F) , which is the torsion subgroup\nof D(P,F). Denoting as in 2.2 by FP (P ) the \u201ctrivial\u201d fusion system of P on itself we have obvious\nidentifications D(P ) = D(P,FP (P )) , T (P ) = T (P,FP (P )) , and Dt(P ) = Dt(P,FP (P )) .\nIn order to describe D(P,F) as subgroup of D(P ), we use the following terminology.\nDefinition 3.3. Let P be a finite p-group and let F be a fusion system on P .\n(1) A kP -module M is called F-stable if Res\u03d5(M) \u223c= ResPQ(M) as kQ-modules for any subgroup\nQ of P and any \u03d5 \u2208 HomF (Q,P ).\n(2) An element v \u2208 D(P ) is called F-stable if Res\u03d5(v) = ResPQ(v) in D(Q), for any subgroup\nQ of P and any \u03d5 \u2208 HomF (Q,P ).\nIn other words, the class v in D(P ) of a capped endo-permutation kP -module V is F-stable\nif and only if the endo-permutation kQ-modules Res\u03d5(V ) and Res\nP\nQ(V ) have isomorphic caps, for\nany subgroup Q of P and any \u03d5 \u2208 HomF (Q,P ). Thus the notion of F-stability characterises\nelements in D(P,F):\nProposition 3.4. Let P be a finite p-group and let v \u2208 D(P ). Then v \u2208 D(P,F) if and only if v\nis F-stable.\nRemark 3.5. Let P be a finite p-group and let F be a fusion system on P . As a consequence\nof Alperin\u2019s fusion theorem, in order to determine whether a kP -module M is F-stable or not, it\nsuffices to check that Res\u03d5(M) \u223c= ResPQ(M) for every fully F-normalised F-essential subgroup Q of\nP and any \u03d5 \u2208 AutF (Q), viewed as morphism from Q to P . Also, by property (4) of Definition 2.1,\nwe can furthermore assume that \u03d5 has order prime to p.\nFor endotrivial modules the notions of stability of a module and its class coincide:\nProposition 3.6. Let P be a finite p-group. The class v \u2208 T (P ) of an endotrivial kP -module V\nis F-stable if and only if V is F-stable.\nProof. This follows from the fact that for any subgroup Q of P we have ResPQ(V ) \u223c= VQ \u2295 Y , for\nsome cap VQ of ResPQ(V ) and some projective kQ-module Y . \u0003\nFor the class v \u2208 D(P ) of an arbitrary capped endo-permutation kP -module V it is still true\nthat if V is F-stable then so is v. The converse, however, need not be true. However, by Green\u2019s\nIndecomposability Theorem, a capped endo-permutation kP -module V can be written in the form\nV \u223c=\n\u2295\nR\n(IndPR(VR))\nnR ,\nTHE DADE GROUP OF A FUSION SYSTEM 5\nwhere R runs over a set of representatives of the conjugacy classes of subgroups of P and where\nVR is a cap of ResPR(V ) for any subgroup R of P , with uniquely determined integers nR. The class\nof V is F-stable if Res\u03d5(V\u03d5(R)) \u223c= VR for any morphism \u03d5 : R \u2192 P in F . For the module V itself\nto be F-stable one would need further compatibility conditions on the integers nR. What we show\nnext is that any F-stable class v \u2208 D(P ) has at least some F-stable representative.\nProposition 3.7. Let F be a fusion system on a finite p-group P and let v \u2208 D(P,F). Then,\nthere exists V \u2208 v such that V is F-stable.\nProof. Let X be a P -P -biset with the properties as in Proposition 2.3. Consider the permutation\nkP -kP -bimodule kX with k-basis X. Let v \u2208 D(P,F) and let W \u2208 v. We will show that the\nkP -module V = kX \u2297kP W is a capped endo-permutation kP -module belonging to v and that V\nis F-stable. By property 2.3 (1) we have\nkX \u223c=\n\u2295\n(Q,\u03d5)\nk[PQ\u00d7\u03d5P ] ,\nwith (Q,\u03d5) running over a suitable family of pairs consisting of a subgroup Q of P and a morphism\n\u03d5 \u2208 HomF (Q,P ). By property 2.3 (2) the bimodule kX has a direct summand of the form \u03d5kP\nfor some \u03d5 \u2208 AutF (P ). Thus, by property 2.3 (3) the bimodule kX has in fact a direct summand\nisomorphic to kP as kP -kP -bimodule. Thus W is isomorphic to a direct summand of V . The\nstability of V follows from the stability property 2.3 (3) of the biset X. It remains to prove that\nV is indeed an endo-permutation module. We have\nV \u223c=\n\uf8eb\uf8ed\u2295\n(Q,\u03d5)\nk[PQ\u00d7\u03d5P ]\n\uf8f6\uf8f8\u2297kP W \u223c= \u2295\n(Q,\u03d5)\nkP \u2297kQ \u03d5kP \u2297kP W \u223c=\n\u2295\n(Q,\u03d5)\nIndPQ(\u03d5W )\nwith (Q,\u03d5) as before. Since v is F-stable, each indecomposable summand of V is isomorphic to\nIndPR(WR) for some subgroup R of P , where WR is a cap of Res\nP\nR(W ). Hence, to verify that V is\nendo-permutation, it suffices to check that IndPR(WR)\u2297k IndPS (W \u2217S) is a permutation kP -module,\nfor all subgroups R,S of P . Now,\nIndPR(WR)\u2297k IndPS (W \u2217S) \u223c= IndPR\n(\nWR \u2297 ResPR(IndPS (W \u2217S))\n) \u223c=\n\u223c= IndPR\n\uf8eb\uf8ed \u2295\nx\u2208[R\\P\/S]\nWR \u2297 IndRxS\u2229R\n(\nRes\nxS\nxS\u2229R(W\n\u2217\nxS)\n)\uf8f6\uf8f8 .\nAgain by F-stability of W , each indecomposable summand of IndRxS\u2229R(Res\nxS\nxS\u2229R(W\n\u2217\nxS)) is isomor-\nphic to IndRT (W\n\u2217\nT ) for some subgroup T \u2264 R. Thus, the above is a direct sum of modules isomorphic\nto\nIndPT\n(\nResRT (WR)\u2297k W \u2217T\n)\n, for some subgroup T \u2264 R .\nNow, each ResRT (WR)\u2297kW \u2217T above is a direct summand of ResPT (W\u2297kW \u2217), which is a permutation\nkT -module. Hence, so is ResRT (WR) \u2297W \u2217T . Since a direct sum of permutation modules is still a\npermutation module, we conclude that IndPR(WR)\u2297k IndPS (W \u2217S) is a permutation kP -module, for\nall subgroups R,S \u2208 F . This shows that V is an endo-permutation kP -module with the desired\nproperties. \u0003\n6 MARKUS LINCKELMANN AND NADIA MAZZA\nWe end this section with a comparison between D(P,F) and the group DP (G), defined by Urfer\nin [24], when P is a Sylow p-subgroup of G and F = FP (G) is the fusion system defined by the\naction of G on P by conjugation. For sake of completeness, let us recall Urfer\u2019s definition.\nDefinition 3.8 (De\u00b4finition 2.15, [24]). Let G be a finite group and let P be a Sylow p-subgroup\nof G.\n(1) A kG-module M is endo-p-permutation if ResGP (M) is endo-permutation. If so, then M is\ncapped if ResGP (M) is capped, i.e. has an indecomposable direct summand with vertex P .\n(2) The set DP (G) of equivalence classes of capped endo-p-permutation kG-modules for the\nrelation M \u223c N if [ResGP M ] = [ResGP N ] in D(P ) is an abelian group. In particular,\nDP (P ) = D(P ).\nNote that the equivalence relation identifies the endo-p-permutation modules whose caps have\nisomorphic sources. In Proposition 2.10 of [24], Urfer shows that an indecomposable endo-permutation\nkP -module V has the property that IndGP (V ) is an endo-p-permutation kG-module if and only if\nV is G-stable (that is, Res\nxP\nxP\u2229P (\nxV ) \u223c= ResPxP\u2229P (V ), for all x \u2208 G). From this, the author de-\nduces an isomorphism between the subgroup of G-stable elements in D(P ) and the group DP (G).\nTranslating the G-stability in terms of F-stability, with F = FP (G), his result becomes:\nProposition 3.9 (Propositions 2.10 and 2.19, [24]). Let G be a finite group and let P be a Sylow\np-subgroup of G. The restriction functor ResGQ : mod(kG) \u2192 mod(kP ) induces an isomorphism\nof abelian groups ResGP : DP (G)\u2192 D(P,F), with inverse induced by the induction functor IndGP\napplied to F-stable modules.\nNote that we reach the same conclusion by applying Proposition 3.7.\nRemark 3.10. Let us point out the following two observations.\n(1) Since two capped endo-p-permutation modules are equivalent if and only if their caps have\nisomorphic sources, we have that 0 \u2208 DP (G) is the set of all p-permutation modules whose\ncap is a Scott module (i.e. isomorphic to a direct summand of the permutation module\nk[G\/P ]).\n(2) The definition of the group T (G) of endotrivial kG-modules, as given in [10], does not\nidentify T (G) to a subgroup of DP (G) unless P = G. Indeed, in T (G), the elements are\nisomorphism classes of modules in the stable module category. Hence, two indecomposable\nendotrivial modules having isomorphic sources are generally not equivalent. Consequently,\nthe kernel of the restriction map ResGP : T (G) \u2192 T (P,F) is a finite group, isomorphic to\nthe group generated by the isomorphism classes of the Scott modules that are endotrivial\n(i.e. such that ResGP (M) \u223c= k \u2295 L for some projective kP -module L, cf. [10, \u00a7 2]). Besides\nthis fact, let us point out that it is yet still an open question to determine whether the\nmap ResGP above is surjective or not. In other words, since for an (indecomposable) endo-p-\npermutation kG-module M such that [ResGP (M)] \u2208 T (P ) does not guarantee that ResGP (M)\nis a \u2018genuine\u2019 endotrivial module, the conclusion is that M has an endotrivial source, but is\na priori not endotrivial (however, M is the Green correspondent of an endotrivial kNG(P )-\nmodule).\nTHE DADE GROUP OF A FUSION SYSTEM 7\n4. Detection\n\u201cDetection\u201d type results describe families CY of sections (T, S) of a finite p-group P for which\nthe product of the maps DefresPT\/S : D(P )\u2192 D(T\/S) yields an injective map\nDefresCY : D(P ) \u2212\u2192\n\u220f\n(T,S)\u2208CY\nD(T\/S) .\nDefinition 4.1. Let Y be a class of finite p-groups closed under taking sections and isomorphisms.\nLet P be a finite p-group, let F be a fusion system on P and let C be a subcategory of F closed\nunder isomorphisms. We denote by CY the category defined as follows:\n\u2022 the objects of CY are the sections (T, S) of P belonging to the subcategory C of F such\nthat the quotient group T\/S belongs to Y.\n\u2022 the morphism set HomCY ((T, S), (T \u2032, S\u2032)) is the set of morphisms \u03d5 : T \u2192 T \u2032 in C, such\nthat S\u2032 \u2264 \u03d5(S), for any two objects (T, S), (T \u2032, S\u2032) in CY , with composition induced by\nthat in F . If C = FP (P ) we write PY instead of FP (P )Y .\nWith the notation above, given a morphism \u03d5 : (T, S)\u2192 (T \u2032, S\u2032) in CY , the groups \u03d5(T ), \u03d5(S)\nbelong to C because C is assumed to be closed under isomorphisms, and the section (\u03d5(T ), \u03d5(S)) of\nP can be identified with the section (\u03d5(T )\/S\u2032, \u03d5(S)\/S\u2032) of T \u2032\/S\u2032. Hence the map DefresT\n\u2032\/S\u2032\n\u03d5(T )\/\u03d5(S) :\nD(T \u2032\/S\u2032)\u2192 D(\u03d5(T )\/\u03d5(S)) is well-defined. Restriction along the isomorphism T\/S \u223c= \u03d5(T )\/\u03d5(S)\ninduces an isomorphism D(\u03d5(T )\/\u03d5(S)) \u223c= D(T\/S) which we will denote abusively by Res\u03d5 again.\nIn this way taking Dade groups of the quotients T\/S yields a contravariant functor on CY .\nDefinition 4.2. Let P be a finite p-group, let F be a fusion system on P , let C be a subcategory\nof F closed under isomorphisms, and let Y be a class of finite p-groups closed under taking sections\nand isomorphisms. Denote by D : CY \u2192 A the contravariant functor sending an object (T, S) in\nCY to the group D(T\/S) and a morphism \u03d5 : (T, S)\u2192 (T \u2032, S\u2032) in CY to the group homomorphism\nDefres\u03d5 = Res\u03d5 \u25e6DefresT\n\u2032\/S\u2032\n\u03d5(T )\/\u03d5(S) : D(T\n\u2032\/S\u2032)\u2192 D(T\/S). We set\nD\u2190(P, CY) = lim\u2190\u2212CY\n(D) .\nSimilarly, we set D\u2190\nt(P, CY) = lim\u2190\u2212CY\n(Dt) and T\u2190(P, CY) = lim\u2190\u2212CY\n(T), where Dt and T are the subfunctors\nof D sending an object (T, S) in CY to the subgroups Dt(T\/S) and T (T\/S) of D(T\/S), respectively.\nWe denote by\nDefresF(C,Y) : D(P,F)\u2192 D\u2190(P, CY)\nthe canonical map determined by the family of maps DefresPT\/S : D(P,F) \u2192 D(T\/S), where\n(T, S) runs over the objects of CY . If C = FP (P ) we write D\u2190(PY) instead of D\u2190(P,FP (P )Y) and\nDefresY : D(P )\u2192 D(PY) instead of DefresF(FP (P ),Y) .\nRemark 4.3. We can identify the group D\u2190(P, CY) with the set of families (v(T,S))(T,S)\u2208CY with\nv(T,S) \u2208 D(T\/S) such that for any morphism \u03d5 : (T, S)\u2192 (T \u2032, S\u2032) in CY , we have that\nDefres\u03d5(v(T \u2032,S\u2032)) = v(T,S) .\n8 MARKUS LINCKELMANN AND NADIA MAZZA\nWith this identification, the groups D\u2190\nt(P, CY), T\u2190(P, CY) become subgroups of D\u2190(P, CY), the group\nD\u2190(P,FY) becomes a subgroup of D\u2190(PY). More generally, if Q is a subgroup of P and G a fusion\nsystem on Q such that G \u2286 F , then GY is a subcategory of FY , and the inclusion functor GY \u2286 FY\ninduces a canonical group homomorphism\nD\u2190(P,FY)\u2192 D\u2190(Q,GY) ,\nmapping (v(T,S))(T,S)\u2208FY to its canonical projection (v(T,S))(T,S)\u2208GY . In particular, we have a\ncanonical map D\u2190(PY)\u2192 D\u2190(QY).\nProposition 4.4. Let P be a finite p-group and let Y be a class of finite p-groups closed under\ntaking sections and isomorphisms. Suppose that for any subgroup Q of P the map DefresY :\nD(Q)\u2192 D(QY) is injective. Then, for any fusion system F on P , the diagram\nD(P,F)\nDefresF(F,Y) \/\/\n _\n\u000f\u000f\nD\u2190(P,FY) _\n\u000f\u000f\nD(P )\nDefresY \/\/ D\u2190(PY)\nis a pull-back diagram, where the vertical maps are the canonical inclusions.\nProof. The commutativity of the diagram is immediate. By the assumptions, the bottom map\nDefresY in the diagram is injective. Since the vertical maps are inclusions, the top horizontal map\nDefresF(F,Y) is injective. We identify D(P,F) and D\u2190(P,FY) with their canonical images in D(P )\nand D\u2190(PY), respectively. Let v \u2208 D(P ) such that DefresY(v) \u2208 D\u2190(P,FY). We need to show that\nv \u2208 D(P,F). Write DefresY(v) = (v(T,S))(T,S)\u2208PY , with v(T,S) = DefresPT\/S(v), for all (T, S) \u2208 PY .\nSince DefresY(v) is assumed to be an element of D\u2190(P,FY), we have v(T,S) = Res\u03d5(v(T \u2032,S\u2032)) for\nany morphism \u03d5 : (T, S) \u2192 (T \u2032, S\u2032) in FY . Let Q be a subgroup of P and let \u03b1 \u2208 AutF (Q),\nviewed as morphism from Q to P . In order to show that v \u2208 D(P,F) it suffices to show that\nResPQ(v) = Resalpha(v). The automorphism \u03b1 of Q induces an automorphism of the category\nQY and hence an automorphism of the group D\u2190(QY), mapping an element (w(T,S))(T,S)\u2208QY to\n(Res\u03b1(w(\u03b1(T ),\u03b1(S))))(T,S)\u2208QY . This automorphism fixes (v(T,S))(T,S)\u2208QY by the choice of v. Since\nthe map DefresY : D(Q) \u2192 D\u2190(QY) is injective it follows that \u03b1 fixes Res\nP\nQ(v), or equivalently,\nResPQ(v) = Res\u03b1(v), whence the result. \u0003\nBouc and The\u00b4venaz proved in [9, Theorem 4.7] that if p is an odd prime and X is the class\nof all p-groups of order at most p3 and exponent p, then for any finite p-group P the group\nhomomorphism DefresX : D(P )\u2192 D\u2190(PX ) is an isomorphism. Combining this with Proposition 4.4\nyields the following consequence.\nCorollary 4.5. Let p be an odd prime and let X be the class of all p-groups of order at most p3\nand exponent at most p. For any finite p-group P and any fusion system F on P the map\nDefresF(F,X ) : D(P,F)\u2192 D\u2190(P,FX )\nTHE DADE GROUP OF A FUSION SYSTEM 9\nis an isomorphism.\nRemark 4.6. Using 4.5 it is easy to check that the group D\u2190(P, P\n1\nX ) is isomorphic to the subgroup\nof\n\u2295\n1<Q\u2264P\nD(NP (Q)\/Q) defined by Bouc and The\u00b4venaz at the beginning of [8, \u00a72].\n5.

A subcategory C of a category F is called convex\nif C is a full subcategory of F with the property that whenever X, Y , Z are three objects in F such\nthat the morphism sets HomF (X,Y ), HomF (Y, Z) are non-empty and such that X, Z belong to\nthe subcategory C, then also Y belongs to C. A convex subcategory is closed under isomorphisms.\nProposition 5.1. Let p be an odd prime, let P be a finite p-group, let F be a fusion system on\nP and let C be a convex subcategory of F . Let Y be a class of finite p-groups closed under taking\nsections and isomorphisms and containing the class X of p-subgroups of order at most p3 and\nexponent at most p. The inclusion CX \u2286 CY induces an isomorphism\nD\u2190(P, CY) \u223c= D\u2190(P, CX ) .\nProof. Identify D\u2190(P, CY) and D\u2190(P, CX ) with the families (v(T,S))(T,S) satisfying\nDefres\u03d5(v(T \u2032,S\u2032)) = v(T,S)\nfor all objects (T, S) and morphisms \u03d5 belonging to the categories CY and CX , respectively. The\ninclusion CX \u2286 CY induces a canonical morphism\nD\u2190(P, CY)\u2192 D\u2190(P, CX )\nWe use Corollary 4.5 to show that this is an isomorphism. We construct an inverse as follows.\nLet (v(T,S))(T,S)\u2208CX be an element in D\u2190(P, CX ). Let (R,Q) be an object in CY . Note that since C\nis convex, the objects of (R\/Q)X belong to the category CX . Indeed, let (T\/Q, S\/Q) \u2208 (R\/Q)X .\nThat is, we have a chain Q E S E T \u2264 R of objects of F , with Q E R and R\/Q \u2208 Y. Thus\nS, T \u2208 C since Q,R \u2208 C and C is convex. Consequently, (T\/Q, S\/Q) \u223c= (T, S) \u2208 CX . Now, define\nw(R,Q) \u2208 D(R\/Q) as pre-image of the subfamily (v(T,S))(T,S)\u2208(R\/Q)X under the isomorphism\nDefresX : D(R\/Q) \u2212\u2192 D\u2190((R\/Q)X )\nfrom [9, Theorem 4.7]. The family (w(R,Q))(R,Q)\u2208CY defined in this way belongs to D\u2190(P, CY). In\nparticular, w(T,S) = v(T,S), for all (T, S) \u2208 CX , whence the composition\nD\u2190(P, CX )\u2192 D\u2190(P, CY)\u2192 D\u2190(P, CX )\nis the identity. For the composition of the maps the other way round, let (v(R,Q))(R,Q)\u2208CY \u2208\nD\u2190(P, CY), and let (w(R,Q))(R,Q)\u2208CY be the image of (v(R,Q))(R,Q)\u2208CX \u2208 D\u2190(P, CX ) under the map\n10 MARKUS LINCKELMANN AND NADIA MAZZA\ndefined above. Identify, via DefresX , any w(R,Q) \u2208 D(R\/Q) with(\nDefresR\/QT\/S w(R,Q)\n)\n(T,S)\u2208(R\/Q)X\n\u2208 D\u2190((R\/Q)X ) , \u2200 (R,Q) \u2208 CY .\nBy construction of w(R,Q) \u2208 D(R\/Q), we have, for any (T, S) \u2208 CX ,\nDefresR\/QT\/S w(R,Q) = w(T,S) = v(T,S) .\nThus, DefresX associates any w(R,Q) \u2208 D(R\/Q) with\n(\nv(T,S)\n)\n(T,S)\u2208(R\/Q)X \u2208 D\u2190((R\/Q)X ), which is\nidentified with v(R,Q) under Defres\n\u22121\nX . Hence v(R,Q) = w(R,Q), for all (R,Q) \u2208 CY . It follows that\nthe composition of maps\nD\u2190(P, CY)\u2192 D\u2190(P, CX )\u2192 D\u2190(P, CY)\nyields the identity, as was left to be shown. \u0003\nDefinition 5.2.

Denote by EF the quotient of the F2-vector space of maps\nE\u22652(F)\u2192 F2 which are constant on connected components of E\u22652(F) by the subspace of constant\nmaps E\u22652(F)\u2192 F2; in the case F = FP (P ) we write EP instead of EFP (P ).\nBouc and The\u00b4venaz proved in [8, Theorem 5.1] that for p an odd prime and P a non cyclic finite\np-group there is a short exact sequence of F2-vector spaces\n0 \/\/ Dt(P )\nDefresP(P1,X) \/\/ D\u2190\nt(P, P 1X )\n\u03a6P \/\/ EP \/\/ 0 ,\nwhere P 1 is the full subcategory of FP (P ) consisting of all non-trivial subgroups of P . In particular,\nif A\u22652(P ) is connected we have an isomorphism Dt(P ) \u223c= D\u2190\nt(P, P 1X ). If A\u22652(P ) is not connected,\nthe map \u03a6P is constructed explicitly, making use of the very particular structure of P and the\nconnected components of A\u22652(P ) in that case. This can be generalised to arbitrary fusion systems;\nthe proof is not as straightforward as one might expect:\nTheorem 5.3. Let p be an odd prime, P a finite p-group and F a fusion system on P . Denote\nby F1 the full subcategory of F consisting of all non-trivial subgroups of P and let X be the class\nof finite p-groups of order at most p3 and exponent at most p. The map \u03a6P induces a short exact\nsequence of F2-vector spaces\n0 \/\/ Dt(P,F) \/\/ D\u2190\nt(P,F1X ) \/\/ EF \/\/ 0\nAs in the proof of [8, Theorem 5.1], the difficult part of the proof of 5.3 arises when A\u22652(P )\nis not connected. By [12, Lemma 2.2], in that case, P has a unique central cyclic subgroup of\norder p, which we will denote by Z. Furthermore, any connected component of A\u22652(P ) contains\neither all elementary abelian subgroups of rank at least 3 or consists of a single elementary abelian\nsubgroup E of rank 2, in which case E is called isolated in A\u22652(P ). If P has rank at least 3 we\ndenote by B the connected component of A\u22652(P ) containing all elementary abelian subgroups of\nTHE DADE GROUP OF A FUSION SYSTEM 11\nrank at least 3 (and their subgroups of rank 2), and in that case, B contains a subgroup E0 of\nrank 2 which is normal in P . If P has rank 2, any connected component of A\u22652(P ) consists of a\nsingle isolated subgroup of rank 2, and there exists an isolated E0 which is normal in P ; we set\nB = {E0} in that case. Whenever E is isolated in A\u22652(P ) then E contains Z, the group NP (E)\nacts transitively on the set of complements of Z in E, and for any such complement S of Z in E\nwe have NP (S) = S \u00d7 L for some cyclic subgroup L of P . One of the additional difficulties in\nthe proof of 5.3 is that Z need no longer be strongly F-closed - and hence a connected component\nof E\u22652(F) may contain both isolated and non isolated elementary abelian subgroups of P . The\nfollowing lemma will be needed to handle this situation.\nLemma 5.4. Let p be an odd prime, P a finite p-group and F a fusion system on P . Let E be an\nelementary abelian subgroup of rank 2 of P which is isolated in A\u22652(P ) and let Q be a subgroup\nof order p of E. Let \u03c8 \u2208 HomF (E,P ). If there is an automorphism \u03b1 \u2208 AutF (E) such that\n\u03b1(Q) 6= Z then there is an automorphism \u03b2 \u2208 AutF (\u03c8(E)) such that \u03b2(\u03c8(Q)) 6= Z.\nProof. Note that E contains Z by the above remarks. If \u03c8(Q) 6= Z we take \u03b2 = Id\u03c8(E). Suppose\nthat \u03c8(Q) = Z. If also Q = Z take \u03b2 = \u03c8 \u25e6 \u03b1 \u25e6 \u03c8\u22121. If Q 6= Z there is y \u2208 NP (E) such that\nyQ 6= Q because NP (E) acts transitively on the set of complements of Z in E, again by the above\nremarks. Thus in this case take \u03b2 = \u03c8 \u25e6 cy \u25e6 \u03c8\u22121, where cy is the automorphism of E given by\nconjugation with y. \u0003\nProof of Theorem 5.3. We identify Dt(P,F) and D\u2190\nt(P,F1X ) with their canonical images in Dt(P )\nand D\u2190\nt(P, P 1X ), respectively. Clearly the map D\nt(P ) \u2192 D\u2190\nt(P, P 1X ) induces an injective map\nDt(P,F)\u2192 D\u2190\nt(P,F1X ). We break up the proof in several steps.\nWe show the exactness at D\u2190\nt(P,F1X ). Let (v(T,S))(T,S)\u2208F1X be an element in ker(\u03a6P )\u2229D\u2190\nt(P,F1X ).\nExplicitly, this means that for any morphism \u03d5 : (T, S) \u2192 (T \u2032, S\u2032) in F1X we have an equality\nv(T,S) = Defres\u03d5(v(T \u2032,S\u2032)), where Defres\u03d5 is as defined in 4.2. The fact that this element is also\nin ker(\u03a6P ) implies, by the above exact sequence of Bouc and The\u00b4venaz, that there is an element\nv \u2208 Dt(P ) such that DefresPT\/S(v) = v(T,S) for any object (T, S) in F1X . We need to show that\nv belongs actually to Dt(P,F). By Alperin\u2019s fusion theorem, we need to show that for any F-\ncentric subgroup Q of P and any \u03d5 \u2208 AutF (Q) considered as morphism from Q to P we have\nResPQ (v) = Res\u03d5(v) in D\nt(Q). If Q is cyclic this is trivial. If Q is not cyclic, the exact sequence\nof Bouc and The\u00b4venaz applies and yields in particular an injective map Dt(Q) \u2192 D\u2190\nt(Q,Q1X ).\nIn other words, Res\u03d5(v) is completely determined by the family\n(\nDefresQV\/U (Res\u03d5(v))\n)\n(V,U)\u2208Q1X\n.\nNow, by transitivity of restriction, DefresQV\/U (Res\nP\nQ v) = Defres\nP\nV\/U (v) = v(V,U) . Moreover, by\nassumption on v, we have v(V,U) = Res\u03d5(v(\u03d5(V ),\u03d5(U))) . Thus, the equality Res\nP\nQ (v) = Res\u03d5(v)\nholds. This shows the exactness at D\u2190\nt(P,F1X ).\nWe show next the exactness at EF . If A\u22652(P ) is connected then EP = {0}, hence EF =\n{0}, and we get an isomorphism Dt(P,F) \u223c= D\u2190\nt(P,F1X ), which proves the theorem in that case.\nWe assume now that A\u22652(P ) is not connected, and so P has the particular structure described\nabove. The proof of the exactness at EF breaks up into two parts: we first need to show that \u03a6P\n12 MARKUS LINCKELMANN AND NADIA MAZZA\nmaps D\u2190\nt(P,F1X ) to EF , and second that this is onto. Let v = (v(T,S))(T,S)\u2208F1X be an element in\nD\u2190\nt(P,F1X ). The map \u03a6P in [8, Theorem 5.1] is constructed as follows: for E an elementary abelian\nsubgroup of P of rank at least 2, the subfamily (v(T,S))(T,S)\u2208(EZ)1X determines a unique element\nwEZ in Dt(EZ), where we use the isomorphism Dt(EZ) \u223c= D\u2190\nt(EZ, (EZ)1X ) from [8, Theorem 5.1]\napplied to the elementary abelian group EZ. Since Z is cyclic of order p we have D(Z) \u223c= F2.\nThus, restriction from EZ to Z sends wEZ to a uniquely determined element \u000fv(E) \u2208 F2. It is\nshown in [8, Lemma 3.2] that this defines a map \u000fv on A\u22652(P ) satisfying \u000fv(E) = \u000fv(E\u2032) if E is\nconjugate to a subgroup of E\u2032, and hence \u000fv is in fact a map E\u22652(P ) \u2192 F2 which is constant on\nconnected components of E\u22652(P ). That is, \u000fv yields an element \u000f\u00afv in EP . We need to show that\n\u000f\u00afv belongs to EF . It suffices to show that the map \u000fv : E\u22652(P ) \u2192 F2 is constant on connected\ncomponents of E\u22652(F). Since \u000fv is invariant with respect to inclusions, it suffices to show that\n\u000fv(E) = \u000fv(\u03d5(E)), for all \u03d5 \u2208 HomF (E,P ), with E elementary abelian of rank 2. If E and \u03d5(E)\nare in the same connected component of E\u22652(P ) the equality holds by [8, Theorem 5.1]. Thus\nwe may assume that E is isolated. Write E = S \u00d7 Z, where Z is the unique central subgroup\nof order p. Then NP (S) = CP (E) = S \u00d7 L has rank 2 as well. Consider first the case where\n\u03d5(E) is also isolated for all \u03d5 \u2208 HomF (E,P ). Choose \u03d5 \u2208 HomF (E,P ) such that \u03d5(E) is fully\nF-normalised, so that N\u03d5 = NP (E); that is, such that \u03d5 extends to a morphism \u03d5\u02dc : NP (E)\u2192 P .\nSince NP (E) permutes transitively the complements of Z in E, the group \u03d5\u02dc(NP (E)), which is\ncontained in NP (\u03d5(E)), permutes transitively the complements of \u03d5(Z) in \u03d5(E). On the other\nhand, \u03d5(E) = Z \u00d7 S\u2032 for some non-central subgroup S\u2032 of P of order p, and NP (\u03d5(E)) permutes\ntransitively the complements of Z in \u03d5(E). This forces \u03d5(Z) = Z. It follows, by definition of \u03a6P ,\nthat wE = Res\u03d5(w\u03d5(E)), and hence \u000fv(E) = \u000fv(\u03d5(E)). Since there is always an isomorphism \u03d5 with\nN\u03d5 = NP (E), we conclude that \u000fv(E) = \u000fv(\u03d5(E)), for all \u03d5 \u2208 HomF (E,P ), in the situation where\n\u03d5(E) is isolated for all \u03d5 \u2208 HomF (E,P ). Suppose next that there exists \u03d5 \u2208 HomF (E,P ) such\nthat \u03d5(E) is contained in an elementary abelian subgroup of rank 3. Denote by \u03c8 : \u03d5(Z) \u2192 Z\nthe restriction of the inverse of \u03d5. Clearly, Z is fully F-centralised, and hence \u03c8 extends to a\nmorphism \u03c8\u02dc : CP (\u03d5(Z)) \u2192 P , such that the composition \u03c8\u02dc \u25e6 \u03d5 is the identity on Z. Note that\n\u03d5(E) \u2264 CP (\u03d5(E)) \u2264 CP (\u03d5(Z)) and that \u03c8\u02dc maps CP (\u03d5(E)) to CP (\u03c8\u02dc(\u03d5(E))), which has rank at\nleast 3. Thus, \u03c8\u02dc(\u03d5(E)) belongs to the connected component B of A\u22652(P ). As before, the equality\n\u03c8\u02dc(\u03d5(Z)) = Z implies wE = Res\u03d5(w\u03d5(E)), hence \u000fv(E) = \u000fv(\u03c8\u02dc(\u03d5(E)). In other words, the value\nof \u000fv at E coincides with the value of \u000fv on B. This shows that \u03a6P maps D\u2190\nt(P,F1X ) to EF , by\n\u03a6P (v) = \u000fv.\nIn order to show that \u03a6P maps D\u2190\nt(P,F1X ) onto EF , we define a map \u03c3 : EF \u2192 D\u2190\nt(P,F1X ),\nsuch that \u03a6P \u25e6 \u03c3 is the identity on EF . Let c be a connected component of E\u22652(F). Write\n\u000fc : E\u22652(F) \u2192 F2 for the map taking values \u000fc(E) = 1 if E \u2208 c and \u000fc(E) = 0 otherwise. The\nimage B\u00af = {\u000f\u00afc | B 6\u2286 c} under the canonical projection of the set B = {\u000fc | B 6\u2286 c}, where c\nruns through the connected components of E\u22652(F) not containing B, forms an F2-basis of EF . If\nE\u22652(F) is connected, or equivalently, if EF = {0} there is nothing to prove. Assume that EF 6= {0}\nand let c be a connected component in E\u22652(F) not containing B; that is, c consists of subgroups\nof rank 2 which are isolated in A\u22652(P ). For any object (R,Q) in F1X set\nN (c,R,Q) = {E \u2208 c | Q < E \u2264 R; \u2203\u03d5 \u2208 AutF (E) : \u03d5(Q) 6= Z}\nTHE DADE GROUP OF A FUSION SYSTEM 13\nand define an element in Dt(R\/Q) by setting\n\u03c3(\u000f\u00afc)(R,Q) =\n\u2211\nE\u2208N (c,R,Q)\nTenR\/QE\/Q(\u2126E\/Q)\nwith the convention \u03c3(\u000f\u00afc)(R,Q) = 0 if the set N (c,R,Q) is empty. Note that if N (c,R,Q) is non\nempty then Q has order p. We will show that the family\n\u03c3(\u000f\u00afc) = (\u03c3(\u000f\u00afc)(R,Q))(R,Q)\u2208F1X\nis an element in the group D\u2190\nt(P,F1X ); that is, given a morphism \u03c8 : (R,Q) \u2192 (R\u2032, Q\u2032) in F1X we\nneed to show that\nDefres\u03c8(\u03c3(\u000f\u00afc)(R\u2032,Q\u2032)) = \u03c3(\u000f\u00afc)(R,Q)\nIf Q, Q\u2032 have order greater than p both sides are zero, so we may assume that Q\u2032 has order p. If Q\nhas order greater than p then again both sides are zero. Thus we may assume that \u03c8(Q) = Q\u2032. We\nconsider first the case where \u03c8(R) = R\u2032; that is, \u03c8 is an isomorphism in F1X . In that case, thanks\nto 5.4, \u03c8 induces a bijection between the sets N (c,R,Q) and N (c,R\u2032, Q\u2032), and thus the required\nequality follows. We may therefore assume, after possibly replacing (R,Q) by (\u03c8(R), \u03c8(Q)), that\nQ = Q\u2032 \u2264 R < R\u2032 and that \u03c8 is the obvious inlcusion map. We show that this implies Q = Z.\nIndeed, if Q 6= Z there is at most one isolated E containing Q, namely E = Q \u00d7 Z. Thus either\nN (c,R,Q), N (c,R\u2032, Q) are both empty (in which case we are done) or both equal to {E}, where\nE = Q\u00d7Z. But in that case we have R\u2032 \u2264 NP (Q) = Q\u00d7L for some cyclic L \u2264 P . Since also R\u2032\/Q\nhas exponent at most p, this forces E = R = R\u2032, contradicting our current assumption R < R\u2032.\nThus Q = Q\u2032Z, and Defres\u03c8 is just restriction Res\nR\u2032\/Z\nR\/Z from R\n\u2032\/Z to R\/Z. Thus\nDefres\u03c8(\u03c3(\u000f\u00afc)(R\u2032,Z)) =\n\u2211\nF\u2208N (c,R\u2032,Z)\nResR\n\u2032\/Z\nR\/Z Ten\nR\u2032\/Z\nF\/Z (\u2126F\/Z)\nNote that if xF is not contained in R then R\/Z \u2229 xF\/Z is trivial because F has order p2. Thus\nthe Mackey formula applied to the summands in the above expression yields\nDefres\u03c8(\u03c3(\u000f\u00afc)(R\u2032,Z)) =\n\u2211\n(F,x)\u2208A\nTenR\/ZxF\/Z(\u2126xF\/Z)\nwhere A is the set of all pairs (F, x) in N (c,R\u2032, Z)\u00d7 [R\\R\u2032] satisfying xF \u2264 R. Now xF \u2264 R means\nprecisely that xF \u2208 N (c,R, Z). Thus the summands on the right side of the previous expression\nare of the form TenR\/ZE\/Z(\u2126E\/Z) for some E \u2208 N (c,R, Z). In order to check that this sum is equal\nto \u03c3(\u000f\u00afc)(R,Z), all we need to do is to check that the multiplicity of such a summand is odd because\nthey all have order two in the Dade group. Write A as disjoint union of sets AE , where, for\nE \u2208 N (c,R,Q), we set\nAE = {(F, x) \u2208 A | xF = E}\nand denote by aE the cardinal of AE . Then\nDefres\u03c8(\u03c3(\u000f\u00afc)(R\u2032,Z)) =\n\u2211\nE\u2208N (c,R,Q)\naE \u00b7 TenR\/ZE\/Z(\u2126E\/Z)\nWe need to show that the coefficients aE are odd, for E \u2208 N (c,R, Z). Every element (F, x) in AE\nis uniquely determined by its second component x \u2208 [R\\R\u2032] because xF = E, hence F = x\u22121E.\n14 MARKUS LINCKELMANN AND NADIA MAZZA\nThus aE = [R\u2032 : R], which is a power of the odd prime p, hence odd. This concludes the proof of\nthe fact that the family \u03c3(\u000f\u00afc) belongs to the group D\u2190\nt(P,F1X ).\nFinally, we need to show that the map \u03c3 : EF \u2192 D\u2190\nt(P,F1X ) is a section for \u03a6P restricted to\nD\u2190\nt(P,F1X ). That is, with the notation above, we need to show that \u03a6P (\u03c3(\u000f\u00afc)) is the image \u000f\u00afc in\nEF of the map \u000fc sending E \u2208 c to 1 and any E \u2208 E\u22652(F) \u2212 c to zero. Let E be an elementary\nabelian subgroup of P of rank at least 2 such that E 6\u2208 c and let (R,Q) \u2208 (EZ)1X . Then the\nset N (c,R,Q) is empty; indeed, any E\u2032 \u2208 N (c,R,Q) would be contained in R, hence in EZ,\nimplying that E, E\u2032 belong to the same connnected component in E\u22652(F). Thus \u03c3(\u000f\u00afc)(R,Q) = 0\nfor all (R,Q) \u2208 (EZ)1X , and hence this family corresponds to the zero element in Dt(EZ) via the\nisomorphism Dt(EZ) \u223c= D\u2190\nt(EZ, (EZ)1X ), hence its image in D\nt(Z) is zero. By the definition of\n\u03a6P this means that \u03a6P (\u03c3(\u000f\u00afc)) is the image of a map sending E \u2208 E\u22652(F) \u2212 c to zero. Let now\nE \u2208 c. The non trivial objects of E1X are of the form (E,Q), where Q is a subgroup of order p\nof E, and we have \u03c3(\u000f\u00afc)(E,Q) = \u2126E\/Q. The image in Dt(E) of this family under the isomorphism\nDt(E) \u223c= D\u2190\nt(E,E1X ) is equal to\n\u2211\nQ;1<Q<E \u2126E\/Q. The restriction to Z of this sum is the element\np\u2126Z = \u2126Z in Dt(Z) because E has exactly p subgroups of order p different from Z and because p\nis odd. This concludes the proof of the fact that \u03a6P (\u03c3(\u000f\u00afc)) = \u000f\u00afc, whence the result. \u0003\n6. Examples\nThe Dade group of a arbitrary fusion system on a finite 2-group P whose possible essential\nsubgroups are Klein or quaternion (of order 8) group turns out to be equal to the Dade group\nD(P ) of P itself. This includes the case of all cyclic, generalised quaternion, quasi- and semi-\ndihedral 2-groups (cf. [15, Satz I.14.9] for the definitions).\nTheorem 6.1. Let P be a finite 2-group and F a fusion system on P . Assume that all F-essential\nsubgroups of P are Klein four groups or quaternion groups of order 8. Then D(P,F) = D(P ).\nBy Alperin\u2019s fusion theorem (cf. Remark 3.5) it suffices to show that for any F-essential fully\nF-normalised subgroup Q of P and any automorphism \u03d5 \u2208 AutF (Q) we have Res\u03d5(v) = ResPQ(v)\nin D(Q), for all v \u2208 D(P ). The proof is based on this in conjunction with the following two\nobservations:\nLemma 6.2. Let P be a finite p-group, where p is any prime, let Q be a characteristic subgroup\nof P , and let \u03d5 \u2208 Aut(P ). Then, Res\u03d5(\u2126P\/Q) = \u2126P\/Q.\nProof. By definition, Res\u03d5(\u2126P\/Q) = \u2126\u03d5(P )\/\u03d5(Q) = \u2126P\/Q, since Q is characteristic. \u0003\nLemma 6.3. If Q is a Klein four group or a quaternion group of order 8, then for any w \u2208 D(Q)\nand any \u03d5 \u2208 Aut(Q) of odd order we have Res\u03d5(w) = w.\nProof. By Lemma 6.2, the Lemma holds for w = \u2126Q, and w = \u2126Q\/Z in case Q is quaternion of\norder 8 and Z is its centre. It remains to consider the \u2018exotic\u2019 elements v = [V ] \u2208 D(Q) for the\nDade group of a quaternion group Q and in case k has cubic roots of unity. By [11, \u00a7 6], in that\ncase Q has exactly two isomorphism classes of indecomposable endo-trivial modules of dimension\n5, and hence an automorphism of odd order must stabilise both classes. \u0003\nTHE DADE GROUP OF A FUSION SYSTEM 15\nProof of Theorem 6.1. By the previous remarks, in order to show the F-stability of all the elements\nof D(P ), it is enough to consider the F-stability with respect to automorphisms \u03d5 \u2208 AutF (Q),\nfor Q a fully F-normalised F-essential subgroup of P . Stability with respect to conjugation by\nelements in P holds trivially, and since AutP (Q) is a Sylow-2-subgroup of AutF (Q), we may\nsuppose that \u03d5 has odd order. Hence, if all F-essential 2-subgroups of P are Klein groups or\nquaternion groups of order 8, then the only automorphisms \u03d5 of Q of odd order have order 3. By\nLemma 6.3, D(Q) is \u3008\u03d5\u3009-stable, and hence ResPQ(v) = Res\u03d5(v) for all v \u2208 D(P ), as was left to be\nshown. \u0003\nCorollary 6.4. If P is a 2-group that is either cyclic, dihedral, semi-dihedral, quasi-dihedral or\ngeneralised quaternion, and F is a fusion system on P , then D(P,F) = D(P ).\nA similar statement for odd p does not hold because \u2126Cp 6= 0, whereas \u2126C2 = 0. More precisely:\nProposition 6.5. Let p be an odd prime and P be an elementary abelian p-group of order p2. Let\nF be a fusion system on P containing a non trivial automorphism \u03d5 \u2208 Aut(P ) of order dividing\np+ 1. Then D(P,F) is a proper subgroup of D(P ).\nProof. Let C be a subgroup of P of order p such that \u03d5(C) 6= C. Then, Res\u03d5(\u2126P\/C) = \u2126P\/\u03d5(C) 6=\n\u2126P\/C . \u0003\nExample 6.6. Let p be an odd prime, let G = PSL(3, p), let P be a Sylow-p-subgroup of G and\nset F = FP (G). Then P is an extraspecial p-group of order p3 and exponent p, and its center\nZ has order p. Set E1, . . . , Ep+1 for the p + 1 elementary abelian subgroups of rank 2, and write\nEi = Si \u00d7 Z, for some non central subgroup Si of Ei of order p, and for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 p+ 1. By [6],\nD(P ) = \u3008\u2126P\/Q | 1 \u2264 Q < P \u3009 = ker(DefPP\/Z)\u2295 InfDP\/Z(P\/Z) \u223c= Zp+2 \u2295 (Z\/2)p+2.\nMore precisely, let\ne0 = \u2126P , ei = \u2126P\/Si , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 p+ 1, ep+2 = \u2126P\/Z , and ei = \u2126P\/Ei\u2212p\u22122 , p+ 3 \u2264 i \u2264 2p+ 3.\nThen, ker(DefPP\/Z) is generated by ei, 0 \u2264 i \u2264 p+1, subject to the relation 2e0 =\n\u2211p+1\ni=1 2ei; whereas\nInfDP\/Z(P\/Z) is generated by all the other ei\u2019s, subject to the relations 2ei = 0, for all p + 3 \u2264\ni \u2264 2p + 3. Moreover, T (P ) \u223c= Zp+1 is generated by e0 and 2ei, for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 p + 1. By Alperin\u2019s\nfusion theorem, the F-stable elements are detected upon F-stability under automorphisms of P ,\nand of the F-essential subgroups. Here, there are two elementary abelian subgroups of order p2\nthat are F-essential. We choose notation such that E1 and E2 are essential (then the poset of the\nnon trivial p-subgroups of the quotient group NG(Ei)\/EiCG(Ei) is not connected, for i = 1, 2).\nMoreover, E3, . . . , Ep+1 form a single F-conjugacy class. The group D(P,F) is generated by the\nelements\nf0 = e0, f1 = ep+4 + e1, f2 = ep+3 + e2, f3 =\np+1\u2211\ni=3\nei and f4 =\n2p+3\u2211\ni=p+5\nei,\nsubject to the relations 2f0 \u2212\n\u22113\ni=1 2fi = 0 and 2f4 = 0.\nExample 6.7. Let P be an extraspecial group of order 73 and exponent 7. By [22], there is an\nexotic fusion system F on P , where the F-centric F-radical subgroups of P are the 8 elementary\nabelian subgroups of order 49. In the same notation as above, with p = 7, we may assume\nthat E1 and E2 are F-conjugate, and E3, . . . , E8 form a single F-conjugacy class. Moreover, any\n16 MARKUS LINCKELMANN AND NADIA MAZZA\nmorphism in F preserves Z. By [6], D(P ) \u223c= Z9 \u2295 (Z\/2)9, and T (P ) \u223c= Z3. A direct computation\nyields D(P,F) \u223c= Z3\u2295 (Z\/2)3, and also T (P,F) = T (P ), because Z is normalised by F . Explicitly,\nker(DefPP\/Z) \u2229 D(P,F) \u223c= Z2 is generated by e0, e1 + e2 and e3 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + e8 subject to the relation\n2e0 =\n\u22118\ni=1 2ei, and Inf\nP\nP\/Z(P\/Z) \u2229 D(P,F) \u223c= Z \u2295 (Z\/2)3 is generated by e9, e10 + e11 and\ne12 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ e16 subject to the relations 2e10 + 2e11 = 0 and\n\u221117\ni=12 2ei = 0. Finally, T (P,F) \u223c= Z2\nis generated by e0, 2e1 + 2e2 and 2e3 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ 2e8.\nReferences\n[1] J. Alperin, M. Broue\u00b4, Local Methods in Block Theory, Ann.
