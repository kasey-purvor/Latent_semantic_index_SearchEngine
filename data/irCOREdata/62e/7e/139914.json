This was achieved by separate alignment \nof both pin and disk.  Disk alignment was allowed by incorporating a kinematic three-ball \narrangement into the disk under-face.  A self-aligning pin alignment system was \nintroduced which did not require the perpendicularity of the pin to be measured.

In this standard the recommended wear test configuration is that of a \nspherical ball or radius-end pin.  This is run against a flat disk.  Whilst the standard does \nleave room for other pin shapes it does not specifically describe them. \n \nA spherical ended pin has the advantage that contact conditions can be relatively well \ncontrolled.  No matter the degree of misalignment between pin axis and disk axis the \ninitial apparent area of contact should be the same, for a given load.  However, the \napparent area of contact will then change during the test up to the maximum given by the \npin-diameter. \n \nA flat-ended pin has some natural advantages: it is easier to machine and easier to coat if \nthe wear testing of coatings is required.  For this reason, flat-ended pins are used in \nperhaps the majority of pin-on-disk tests [2,3,4,5,6,7]. \n \nHowever, the main disadvantage for a flat-ended pin test is the lack of controllability of \nthe apparent area of contact.  This will be dominated by the misalignment of pin and disk.  \nThe initial apparent area of contact will not be known, nor can the change in apparent \narea of contact with wear of the pin be easily predicted, as it can for a spherical ended \nsystem.   \n4 \n \nThe ASTM G99-95a standard recommends a maximum limit of \u00b11\u00ba of misalignment \nbetween the pin and disk axis.  However, as reported here, this leads to highly variable \ninitial contact conditions in a flat on flat pin-on-disk test.  These in turn are shown to lead \nto a large degree of variability in the wear test data obtained.  For a controllable, \nreproducible, flat on flat pin-on-disk test, improved control over the pin and disk \nalignment is required. \n \nThis paper presents a methodology for improving alignment in a flat on flat pin-on-disk \ntest in which the initial alignment is improved.  The starting point for this work was the \ncommonly used pivoting beam, dead weight design of pin-on-disk machine, to which \nminimal modifications were made.  Short-duration, aggressive wear tests were used to \nshow proof of concept.  An analysis of data obtained is presented to show how the \nreproducibility of the data improves with the new methodology.  Finally, an effect of the \nimproved alignment system on wear volume is noted and discussed. \n \n \nIntroduction: Design Methodology \n \nTo reduce initial misalignment on the dead weight, pivoted pin-on-disk machine two \nareas were considered.  First, any vertical oscillations of the disk counterface had to be \nreduced, and second the contact conditions, notably the angle of contact between the pin \nand the disk, had to be controlled. \n5 \n \nFigure 1 shows a simplified diagram of the oscillation of the wear signal due to the disk \ncounterface not being perpendicular to its axis of rotation [Figure 1b].  This oscillation, \nwhen the disk rotates about the drive shaft axis, can be monitored using the \u2018continuous \nwear\u2019 sensor on a pin-on-disk machine.  It imparts what can be termed an \u201camplitude\u201d of \noscillation to this data.  Minimisation of the disk \u201crun-out\u201d which causes the oscillation is \nessential to promoting contact conditions that are consistent throughout one disk rotation. \n \nExpensive bearing systems and precision machining would reduce the degree of run-out.  \nHowever, each time the disk was changed the run-out would also change.  Hence this \napproach would necessitate precision machining of each disk to improve its positional \nrepeatability.  For this reason the methodology chosen here was to redesign the disk to \nallow its alignment to be adjustable.  The experimental method would then be changed to \nincorporate readjustment of the disk, as required to take into account different disks.  \n \nThe alignment of the flat-ended pin to the disk counterface could have been \naccomplished in several ways.  However, the majority of solutions would have required \nthat a measurement of \u2018correct\u2019 contact between the flat on the pin end and the surface of \nthe disk be obtained.  Instead, the method adopted was for the pin to align itself \nautomatically without the necessity of measuring the contact conditions.  \n \nThis was achieved by allowing compliance between the loading beam carriage and the \npin holder.  This movement was provided by a spherical seating arrangement which \n6 \nallowed the flat surface of the pin to move about a central point and to align itself to the \ndisk\u2019s surface.  Once the pin had attained its self-alignment the spherical seating was \nclamped to hold the pin rigid. \n \nIn the design the positional centre of the spherical seating was critical.  If the spherical \ncentre was coincident with the pin\u2019s flat surface, the moments exerted by the dead \nweight, at the pin\u2019s outer radius, would be greater than the moment from the tangential \nfriction force.  This would allow self-alignment of the pin to take place. \n \n \nExperimental Method: Equipment Modification \n \nA schematic diagram of the initial configuration of the pin-on-disk test apparatus is \nshown in Figure 2.  The design is of the dead weight, pivoted beam type. \n \nThe removable wear disk was located on a flanged drive shaft that also provided a drive \npin to ensure that the disk rotated.  After the disk was placed over the drive pin, a central \nbolt was used to clamp the disk into position.  This arrangement gave radial alignment to \nthe disk when it was placed on the flange but did not ensure zero run-out for the disk\u2019s \ncounterface.  The flange\u2019s run-out, and any error in parallelism, between the upper and \nlower faces of the disk, combined to give the total run-out measured on the disk\u2019s rotating \ncounterface.  The total run-out, or wear signal \u2018amplitude\u2019, for the original configuration \nof the apparatus was measured to be 28\u00b5m at a radius of 50 mm.  \n7 \n \nThe pin was secured into a pin holder.  Owing to the clearance allowance within the \nholder the pin\u2019s axial misalignment was theoretically a maximum of 2o out of alignment \nwith the intended pin holder axis.  However, a skilled operator using the correct pin \ntightening procedure could easily reduce this error to less than 1o.  The perpendicularity  \nof the flat, on the end of the pin, to the pin axis was not controlled \u2013 except in the \nmachining process of the pin end.  \n \nNo adjustment for pin length was built into the original pin holder.  Therefore, any \nvariations in the length of the individual pin added to the error of perpendicularity \nrelative to the disk\u2019s surface.  A variation of \u00b1 0.5 mm on the pin\u2019s overall length gave a \nmaximum error of \u00b1 0.1o due to the position of the pivot on the load beam. \n \nThe estimated error of the pin alignment combined with the measured run-out on the disk \nwould be additive in the extreme case and give a perpendicularity error of  \u00b1 2.3o, of \nwhich \u00b1 2.0o could be attributed to incorrect use of the pin holder itself.  This error would \nbe seen as an error on the flat to flat contact between the end of the pin and the surface of \nthe disk.  Therefore, using the initial equipment configuration, a skilled operator, \nminimising the pin to pin holder axial alignment error, would have little problem \nmaintaining the contact perpendicularity error within the \u00b1 1.0o allowed by ASTM G99-\n95a.  However, as is demonstrated below this \u2018standard\u2019 equipment configuration gave \nsignificant variations in the measured wear data. \n \n8 \nThe modified pin-on-disk configuration is shown diagrammatically in Figures 3 and 4.  \n \nThe adjustment of the disk was provided by a kinematic arrangement of three radial equi-\nspaced balls, placed on the opposite side to the counterface surface at the extreme radius \nof the disk [Figure 3].  However, the disk still maintained a central clamp screw and a \ndrive pin hole to allow it to fit on the apparatus. \n \nOne of the three balls was fixed whilst the other two could be vertically adjusted.  The \nfixed ball gave a reference height to which the other two balls were manually adjusted. \nThis operation was done sequentially as the disk was slowly rotated about its drive axis \nwith the run-out monitored by a precision LVDT set at the wear radius.  This kinematic \narrangement was able to reduce the total run-out at a 50mm disk radius to 3.5\u00b5m.  The \n3.5\u00b5m oscillations were due to form imperfections of the disk\u2019s counterface itself and \nrepresented a \u201cbest case\u201d that no further adjustment could reduce. \n \nThe pin holder [Figure 4] was modified to allow the secured pin to pivot about a spherical \nseating, which in turn allowed the pin to align its flat end to the surface of the disk. Once \nthis self-alignment was complete the spherical seating was clamped so that no further \nmovement was allowed during the test. \n \n \nExperimental Method: Pin-on-Disk Test \n \n9 \nThe experimental methodology followed the ASTM G99-95a method.  Changes from the \nstandard methodology were: no disk mass loss data was measured; a continuous height \nmeasurement system was used to record height changes, which were used as one method \nof calculating wear loss; a flat-ended pin design, radius 5 mm, was used. \n \nThe pin-on-disk test machine used was an in-house design with a rotating disk \nconfiguration.  The data recording software was written in-house.  It allowed for standard \nwear tests and also for high data acquisition rate \u2018snap-shots\u2019 of data at 60 rpm. \n \nThe ASTM G99-95a test set-up and specimen weighing protocols were followed.  LVDT \nand balance sensitivities were better than the recommended standard.  The pin material \nwas \u2018silver steel\u2019, composition: 1.1 \u2013 1.2 % carbon, 0.25 \u2013 0.45 % manganese, 0.1 \u2013 0.25 \n% silicon, 0.35 \u2013 0.5 chromium.  Average hardness 257 VHN.  The disk material surface \nwas a self-adhesive medium grade silicon carbide abrasive paper [P400, Struers], mean \nparticle size 40 \u00b5m.  This was laid on the steel disk.  Test duration was 300 m [300 s] at 1 \nms-1 [254 rpm].  The tests were unlubricated. \n \nTwo sets of tests were carried out, the first with the original configuration of the \napparatus and the second set using the modified pin holder and kinematic disk.  Test set \nup details specific to the new configuration of pin-on-disk were detailed in the previous \nsection.  The same disk was used for each set of tests, the spent silicon carbide abrasive \npaper was replaced between tests without removing the disk from the machine, this gave \na disk run-out that was consistent for each set of tests. \n10 \n \n \nExperimental Method: Data Types \n \nBelow is an explanation of each data set taken or calculated from the pin-on-disk test \ndata.   \n \nThe raw data consisted of a scaled voltage signal, representing pin height in mm, from \nthe wear LVDT taken against a time base.  Two different time bases were used: 200 point \nper second for a \u2018snap shot\u2019 of the pin-disk configuration before or after the test, and one \npoint per second during the wear test.  Examples of these two data sets are shown in \nFigures 5 and 6 respectively.  The pin track on the disk was designed such that one data \nper point second correlated to one data point per metre of travel.  All but the first two \ndata types, and type 6, listed below are derived from the one point per second time base.  \n \n1. Average wear signal \u2018amplitude\u2019: the maximum difference [i.e. run-out] in the wear \nLVDT height signal, in millimetres, time base 200 points per second, for one half \nrevolution of the disk [Figure 5]. \n2. Average single rotation wear: change in the wear LVDT height signal, in millimetres, \ntime base 200 points per second, after one full rotation of the disk [Figure 1b]. \n3. Averaged wear height data: a 10 point average trend line fitted to the wear LVDT   \nheight signal, which is collected at one data point per metre [Figure 6a].  This is a \nbackwards average designed such that the fit line will always start at a wear height of \n11 \nzero and a distance of zero.  This allows comparison of data from two different tests - \nwhich will have different starting conditions with respect to their pin-disk \nconfiguration, that is a different, usually non-zero, place with respect to the \n\u2018amplitude\u2019 of the wear signal. \n4. Average arithmetic mean deviation of the wear height data: the arithmetical mean of \nthe wear data between time intervals of 100 s and 200 s [Figure 6b].  A centre line \nwas superimposed on the raw data set and the deviations from the line calculated.  \nThis is mathematically equivalent to an arithmetic mean roughness. \n5. Average wear calculated from pin height change: the difference in millimetres of the \n10-point averaged wear LVDT height signal at the start and end of the test was taken \nas the height loss of a 5 mm radius cylinder.  The volume loss was then calculated.  \nThere is a systematic error in this measurement as the change in height was assumed \nto be entirely owing to wear of the steel pin, not the silicon carbide paper.  The \ndensity of the steel pins was taken as 7.68 g cm-3. \n6. Average wear calculated from mass loss: the difference, in grams, of the pin\u2019s mass \nbefore and after the test divided by the density of the steel. \n7. Height-wear as a fraction of mass-wear: the volume loss as calculated above from the \npin-height change as a fraction of the volume loss calculated from change in mass. \nThe fraction was calculated for each individual test, then the average fraction and \nstandard deviation for a particular test load was calculated.  If the two methods of \nassessing wear yielded the same results then the fraction for each load would be 1, \nand the standard deviation would be zero. \n \n12 \n \nResults \n \nFigures 7 to 12 present pin-on-disk test results for the unmodified pin-disk configuration.  \n \nFigures 7a and 7b show the average wear signal amplitude, at the start and end of the 300 \nm wear test, respectively, for the unmodified pin-disk configuration.  In both cases the 20 \nN amplitude is the minimum.  The standard deviation of the amplitude notably increases \nwith load, even though the mean value does not.  The average volume reduces for all \nloads after the test. \n \nFigure 8 shows the wear height change for one rotation of the disk at the start of the test.  \nThe average appears to increase with load, though not linearly.  The standard deviation at \nall loads is greater than 40% of the average single rotation wear value. \n \nFigure 9 plots the variation against time of the 10-point averaged wear height for the \nwear tests with the unmodified pin-on-disk configuration.  [The data is plotted up to \nmaximum height change of 0.1 mm, to allow easy comparison with after modification \ndata, Figure 15.]  A wide variation in results can be observed for tests at a single load.  \nThe variation between the test specimen with the minimum change in height and that \nwith maximum change in height in a five-test series was 0.21 mm, 0.14 mm and 0.03 mm \nfor the 30, 20 and 10 N loads respectively.  It can also be observed in Figure 9 that data \n13 \nfrom different test loads shows considerable overlap, notably between data from the 30 N \nand 20 N tests. \n \nFigure 10 shows the arithmetic means of the raw wear signal deviation between 100 and \n200 m.  Similarly to the average wear signal amplitude results shown in Figure 7, this \nindicates a drop at 20 N.  Again the standard deviation increases with load.  At 20 N the \nstandard deviation is greater than 50% of the average arithmetic mean value. \n \nFigure 11 plots average wear volume loss against load.  Figure 11a shows average \nvolume loss calculated from the wear height change measurement, assuming that the \nheight change was entirely owing to pin wear.  There is a linear increase in volume of \nmaterial lost with load.  The absolute standard deviation also increases very significantly \nwith load, though the increase relative to the average value is not significant.  Figure 11b \nshows the volume loss calculated from the mass loss of the pin calculated from mass \nmeasurements before and after the test.  Again there is a linear increase with load, and \nstandard deviation markedly increases with load. \n \nFigure 12 shows the average volume loss calculated from pin wear height reduction as a \nfraction of average volume loss calculated from mass loss.  This is plotted as a function \nof load. Hence it is a comparison of the data presented in Figures 11a and 11b. Whilst the \n20 N results gave an average of 1 the standard deviation is greater than 0.5.  The average \nof the data for 30 N load average is below 1, but lies within one standard deviation of 1.  \nHowever for the 10 N data, the average wear calculated from height loss is approximately \n14 \none third of that calculated from the mass loss data, the average lying considerably \noutside one standard deviation away from 1. \n \nFigures 13 through to 19 show test results from the modified pin-disk configuration tests. \n \nFigures 13a and 13b show the average wear signal amplitude, at the start and end of the \n300 m wear test respectively, for the modified pin-disk configuration.  In both cases any \nvariation with load in mean value lies within the standard deviation of the data.  These \nresults are in contrast to the unmodified configuration data shown in Figures 7a and 7b.  \nComparison with Figures 7a and 7b also indicates that the average values at the start and \nend of the test are significantly lower for the modified configuration.  This is particularly \napparent for a comparison of start of test values. \n \nFigure 14 shows the wear height change for one rotation of the disk at the start of the test.  \nThe average increases with load, though not linearly.  In comparison with the unmodified \nconfiguration data presented in Figure 8 it can be seen that the average values at each \nload are reduced by more than 50% by modifying the pin-disk configuration.  The \nstandard deviations are also significantly reduced. \n \nFigure 15 shows the 10-point averaged wear height variation against time plots for the \npin-on-disk tests.  The range of data for each load is significantly reduced in comparison \nwith the unmodified configuration [Figure 9] and quite consistent across the test loads.  \nThe variation between the test specimen with the minimum change in height and that \n15 \nwith maximum change in height in a five-test series was 0.019 mm, 0.018 mm and 0.016 \nmm for the 30, 20 and 10 N loads respectively, i.e. there was little load dependence.  In \ncomparison the lowest variation for the unmodified configuration was 0.3 mm.  There \nwas no overlap of test data from different loads.  \n \nFigure 16 shows the arithmetic means of the raw wear signal deviation between 100 and \n200 m.  The average values at the three loads are consistent within their standard \ndeviations.  In comparison with data from the unmodified configuration [Figure 10] the \nstandard deviations are significantly reduced. \n \nFigure 17 plots average wear volume loss against load.  Figure 17a shows average \nvolume loss calculated from the wear height change measurement, assuming that the \nheight change was entirely owing to pin wear.  There is a linear increase in volume of \nmaterial lost with load.  The standard deviation does not vary significantly with load, \nunlike the data from the unmodified configuration [Figure 11a].  Figure 17b shows the \nvolume loss calculated from the mass loss of the pin, calculated from mass measurements \nbefore and after the test.  Again there is a linear increase with load, and standard \ndeviation does not significantly vary with load.  A comparison of Figure 17 and Figure 11 \nindicates that for both the height and mass loss data the modified pin-disk configuration \nproduces significantly lower values of wear and significantly reduced standard \ndeviations. \n \n16 \nFigure 18 shows the average volume loss calculated from pin wear height reduction as a \nfraction of average volume loss calculated from mass loss.  The 20 and 30 N averages \nboth lie within a standard deviation of 1, whereas the 10 N average lies just outside one \nstandard deviation from 1.  The standard deviations are quite consistent across the loads \nand are notably smaller than for the unmodified pin-disk configuration.  Of the three \nloads the deviation from 1 is the largest at 10 N for both the modified and unmodified \nconfiguration [Figure 12]. \n \n \nDiscussion \n \nIt is clear that the adoption of the modified pin-disk configuration gives considerable \nimprovement in the reproducibility of the test.  A comparison of the data sets for the  \nunmodified configuration [Figures 7 to 12] and modified configuration [Figures 13 to 18] \nshows a decrease in standard deviation for each data set for the modified configuration, \nexcept for the average wear signal \u2018amplitude\u2019 after the test [Figure 13b].  \n \nThe average wear signal amplitude post-test would be expected to be relatively \nunchanged.  This is a post-test \u2018snap-shot\u2019 assessment of pin-disk mismatch after the 300 \ns test. Figures 9 and 15 indicate that for this material couple steady state wear is reached \nby 100 s.  Hence both the modified and unmodified configurations would be expected to \nhave worn in by 300 s, minimising any difference owing to pin-disk misalignment.  In \n17 \ncontrast Figures 7a and 13a are an indication of the pin-disk misalignment before the test.  \nThe standard deviation of the unmodified configuration is significantly higher. \n \nA comparison of Figures 9 and 15 also indicates that the modified configuration can \nproduce consistent values for wear for a given load, and that the unmodified \u2018standard\u2019 \nconfiguration does not yield reproducible values for flat on flat contact.  Again it should \nbe emphasised that the degree of mismatch for the unmodified configuration, when used \nby a skilled operator, was within the limits recommended by ASTM G99-95a. \n \nComparison of the two data sets also indicates, again with the exception of the post-test \nwear signal amplitude, that the adoption of the modified configuration decreases the \naverage value of the data set for a given load.   This can be seen for the pre-test wear \namplitude, the average single rotation wear at the start of the test, the arithmetic mean of \nthe wear signal, the average volume loss calculated from height or from mass loss and in \na comparison of Figures 9 and 15. \n \nFigure 19 shows a comparison of the four volume loss data sets presented in Figures 11 \nand 17.  It illustrates this point for the height and mass loss calculated wear data.  The \nvolume loss shows a linear relationship with load in each case.  However, it is \nsignificantly greater for the unmodified configuration for both the height change and \nmass loss calculations. \n \n18 \nThe modified, self-aligning configuration can be thought of as the close to optimised \nstarting alignment between pin and disk.  Hence, any data point collected for the \nunmodified configuration will represent an assessment of wear for a relatively \nmismatched pin-disk configuration.  Effectively, the unmodified configuration always \nskews the data away from that which would be obtained for the best alignment.  The \nconclusion, therefore, is that this misalignment produces the higher wear observed.  This \nis supported by a comparison of Figures 8 and 14 which indicates that within the first \nrotation of the disk the height change for the unmodified configuration is approximately \ndouble that of the modified pin-disk configuration.  That these effects are artefacts of the \npin-height measurement method of determining wear is ruled out by the difference \nbetween the unmodified and modified wear calculated from mass loss, as shown in \nFigure 19. \n \nThe above implies that initial apparent area of contact correlates with the wear of the pin.  \nThe higher misalignment will always act to reduce the apparent area of contact at the \nbeginning of the test.  An argument could be made that a relatively misaligned pin might \nwear at a greater rate because the lip of the pin in contact with the surface will not be as \nconstrained by surrounding pin material as would be the case for true flat on flat contact.  \nThis lack of constraint then either changes the severity of the acting wear mechanism, or \nperhaps introduces a new mechanism specifically at the lip.  However, no direct \nmechanistic evidence was obtained in support of this hypothesis.   \n \n \n19 \nConclusions \n \nA flat on flat pin-on-disk test was modified to improve the initial alignment of the pin end \nwith the disk.   \n \nThis modification in alignment affected the wear data produced.  The standard deviation \nof the wear data was considerably reduced and the correlation of the wear data with \napplied load significantly improved. \n \nThe modified alignment also reduced the absolute value of wear recorded.  This effect \nwas observed for both wear volume assessed from mass change and wear volume \nassessed from pin height change.  The reduced constraint of a misaligned pin in \ncomparison with a well-aligned pin may account for the difference in these results. \n \n \n20 \nReferences \n \n \n1 ASTM standard designation G 99-95a (reapproved 2000), Standard test method for \nwear testing with a pin-on-disk apparatus, Metals test methods and analytical procedures \n03.02, ASTM International, pp 414-419, 2002.   \n2 Y.
