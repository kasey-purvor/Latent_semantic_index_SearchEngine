The \u2018temporary stay and \nassistance centre\u2019 (CPTA) on Lampedusa came to public attention in the fall of 2004 \nwhen Italian authorities expelled more than thousand undocumented migrants to \nLibya on military and civilian airplanes. Numerous and consistent allegations of \ndegrading treatment of third-country nationals in detention in the holding centre, the \ndifficulty in gaining access to the asylum determination process and the large scale \nexpulsions to Libya, brought it to the attention of European and international \ninstitutions. The European Parliament (EP), the European Court of Human Rights \n(ECHR) and the United Nations\u2019 Human Rights Committee (CCPR) all called on Italy \nto respect asylum seekers and refugees\u2019 right to international protection and to refrain \nfrom collective expulsions of asylum seekers and irregular migrants to Libya, a \ncountry that has no asylum system and has not a signed the Geneva Convention on \nRefugees.   \n \nPositioned some 200 km south of Sicily and 300 km north of Libya, the island of \nLampedusa became the main point of arrival for boats carrying undocumented \n 4 \nmigrants and asylum seekers from Libya to Italy in 2004. A total of 10,497 migrants, \n412 of whom were minors and 309 women, transited through the Lampedusa CPTA \nthat year (EP 2005: 2). Migrants commonly depart from Libya in overcrowded and \nmakeshift boats and undertake a perilous sea journey which can last up to several \nweeks. Once in the Italian waters near Lampedusa, the boats are intercepted by Italian \nborder guards and migrants transferred to the island\u2019s holding centre. After staying in \nthe holding centre for a period that varies usually between five and 45 days, the \nmajority of migrants are transferred to CPTAs in Sicily or southern Italy while others \nare expelled to Libya.    \n \nNo official data are available on the countries of origin or the reasons for migrating \nfor migrants detained in Lampedusa. The CCPR points to the presence of refugees \nand asylum seekers among those detained as well as among those expelled to Libya. \nThe CPTA\u2019s authorities refer to all third-country nationals held in the centre as \n\u2018illegal migrants\u2019 and claim that there are nearly no asylum seekers present among \nmigrants who depart from Libya. They also assert that the majority of third-country \nnationals are economic migrants of Egyptian nationality (EP 2005: 3). The data \ngathered in Lampedusa by the Italian NGO ARCI and the M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res \nidentify instead Middle East (Iraq and Palestine), Maghreb, Horn of Africa (including \nSudan) and Sub-Saharan Africa as migrants\u2019 regions of origin (ARCI 2005a; 2005b). \nMore consistent data on migrants\u2019 countries of origin and the nature of their journeys \nremain however unavailable in spite of the continuity of migratory flows from north \nAfrica to the south of Italy since the end of the 1990s. \n \n 5 \nThe CPTA in Lampedusa is one of eleven existing holding centres, most of which are \nlocated in the south of Italy. CPTAs are instruments for the detention of \nundocumented migrants pending expulsion and their purpose is to ensure effective \nfunctioning of expulsion procedures. Identified as complementary, detention and \nexpulsion of undocumented migrants are crucial pillars of Italy\u2019s politics towards \nirregular migration. In the effort to control undocumented migratory flows from \nAfrica into its territory, Italy established cooperation on illegal migration with Libya, \nits southern Mediterranean neighbour. Initially signed in Rome in 2000 as a general \nagreement to fight terrorism, organized crime and illegal migration, and strengthened \nin 2003 and 2004 via follow-up agreements, today Italian-Libyan partnership extends \nto include readmission agreement, training for Libyan police officers and border \nguards, and Italian-funded detention and repatriation programmes for irregular \nmigrants in Libya.2\n \n  \nThis essay presents an overview of events and policies implemented in Lampedusa \nand Libya respectively, and outlines the issues surrounding these policies. Using the \nmaterial provided by the Italian authorities, European institutions and the NGOs, the \npaper further examines the schemes developed by the Italian and Libyan \nGovernments, the European Union and the International Organization for Migration \n(IOM) as main actors involved in implementing immigration-related programmes and \npolices in Lampedusa and Libya. A methodological note is necessary here. The data \navailable on measures regarding detention and deportations of irregular migrants and \nasylum seekers in Lampedusa and Libya are often contradictory and incomplete. In \nthe case of Lampedusa, scarce information provided by Italian authorities was lately \nsupplemented by data gathered by the European Parliament, the NGOs and \n 6 \njournalists. When it comes to Libya, the content of agreements, whether between the \nItalian and Libyan Governments or between the latter and the IOM, remain \nundisclosed. Hence, rather than offering an exhaustive description of legislative acts \nthe first two sections of the paper make use of the legislative framework as a way of \ncontextualizing the main procedures and policies carried out in Lampedusa and Libya.  \n \nHaving examined, in the first two sections of the paper, the issues surrounding Italy\u2019s \nalleged violation of the right to asylum, the non-refoulment principle and the \nprohibition of collective expulsions, the following two sections focus on migratory \npatterns into and from Libya that raise questions about a number of assumptions \nbehind the Italian Government\u2019s detention and deportation policies. The third section \nquestions the idea of the mass influx (i.e. invasion) of undocumented migrants \ncommonly summoned by both Governments and the media to portray migratory flows \nfrom Africa and shows that this notion gives an erroneous representation of \ncontemporary Mediterranean migration. They conceal Italy\u2019s reluctance to assume its \nshare of asylum responsibilities within the European Union.  \n \nItaly's implementation of schemes that hamper asylum seekers' right to access the \nasylum procedure raises the issue of the European Union's responsibility and its \ncommitment to the protection of refugees. The return of undocumented migrants from \nEU Member states and the collaboration with Libya on matters of irregular migration \nwill soon be regulated by the EU Return Directive and the Libya-EU Joint Action \nPlan. These instruments are designed to provide a minimum set of procedural and \nlegal safeguards for the return, removal and custody of third-county nationals residing \nillegally in EU Member States and limit the EU's involvement in the detention \n 7 \nfacilities in Libya to the provision of heath care and services rather than support of \nreturn schemes. The analysis in section five of the Return Directive and the Action \nPlan, as well as of the European Commission (EC)-funded IOM programmes in Libya \nraise the issue of whether or not the EU and its Member states are effectively \ncontracting out of their responsibilities over migration and asylum matters and \nwhether the Return Directive and the Action Plan leave too large a space for the \nMember states to circumvent the EU framework and apply restrictive exceptions. \n \nLampedusa holding centre: detention and the right to asylum \n \nAs instruments for the detention of irregular migrants and asylum seekers, CPTAs \nwere established under \u2018Turco-Napoletano\u2019 law with the purpose of administrative \ndetention of third-country nationals pending expulsion from Italy. Asylum seekers, as \nwell as migrants who have been served an expulsion order, are detained in CPTAs for \na maximum of 60 days when they present an asylum application after having received \nan expulsion or refusal of entry order and\/or if their appeal is at the final stage and \nthey are awaiting the court\u2019s decision on the appeal. The CPTAs however do not cater \nprimarily to asylum seekers. The so-called \u2018Bossi-Fini\u2019 law amended the detention \nregulations set by \u2018Turco-Napoletano\u2019 law and established \u2018identification centres\u2019 as \nspecific centres for the detention of asylum seekers. While detention of asylum \nseekers cannot be carried out with the sole purpose of examining their application, it \nis nevertheless mandatory in cases when asylum seekers present their application after \nbeing arrested for entering or attempting to enter the country illegally, and\/or residing \nin Italy in an irregular situation. The Italian Government is currently in the process of \n 8 \nestablishing \u2018polifunctional\u2019 immigration centres to carry out administrative and \njuridical functions of both CPTAs and identification centres. \n \nThroughout 2004 and 2005, the holding centre on Lampedusa was denounced for the \nlack of access to the asylum procedure. European NGOs have drawn attention to the \nfailure of the centre\u2019s authorities to provide information about the possibility of \nclaiming asylum and to guarantee individual examination of asylum through in-depth \ninterviews that assess asylum seeker\u2019s individual circumstance. Migrants and asylum \nseekers, the NGOs remark, have no effective access to an interpreter, and are often \nidentified by staff not qualified as interpreters by the use of improvised identification \nprocedures in which the migrant\u2019s nationality is determined on the basis of their skin \ncolour and facial characteristics.3\n \n The centre is permanently overcrowded and the \ndetention conditions degrading: there is for example, no access to the proper health \nassistance and the hygienic conditions are substandard. Moreover, journalistic sources \nhave disclosed the abuse of migrants while in detention and the use of coercive \nmethods in order to carry out deportations (Gatti 2005a).  \nOn the basis of gathered data ten European NGOs4\n \n have taken legal actions against \nthe Italian Government, filed a complaint with the European Commission and called \nthe Commission to sanction Italy for  \n\uf0a7 Violation of the right of defence both with regards to access to an interpreter or \nand a lawyer, or to be possibility of appealing against the expulsion; the \nprinciple of hearing the different; and hence the right to asylum as recognised by \nthe Amsterdam Treaty \n 9 \n\uf0a7 Violation of the prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment, \nprovided for in article 4 of the European Charter of fundamental rights and \narticle 3 of the European Convention for the protection of human rights and \nfundamental freedoms  \n \nIn the complaint of the 20 January 2005 as well as in successive open letters to the \nCouncil and the Commission,5\n \n Amnesty International urged the Commission to \npublicly distance itself from the actions of the Italian authorities and to carry out an \nindependent investigation regarding Italy\u2019s compliance with international legal \nobligations as part of the EU acquis. \nItalian authorities confirm the NGOs\u2019 data on the 350-400 daily average presence in \nthe Lampedusa CPTA, as well as the case of overcrowding of up to 1000 people \nduring the summer months. Their position diverges though on other points raised by \nNGOs. Even though there are cases when third-country nationals are detained for up \nto 60 days, the Italian authorities maintain that in most cases migrants\u2019 stay at the \nCPTA does not exceed four to five days. They state that the majority of detained \nmigrants are Egyptian nationals and that nationality is determined on the basis of their \nphysical characteristics and accent, as well as by a short individual interview, to \nwhich everyone is entitled. As explained by the Italian authorities, if migrants do not \ncome forward to request asylum they are immediately repatriated to Libya or to their \ncountry of origin (EP 2005: 3). Those who however do request asylum are moved to \nthe Crotone CPTA, on the Italian mainland. The authorities state also that the majority \nof third-country nationals arriving from Libya are not asylum seekers but rather \neconomic migrants.  \n 10 \n \nDespite the denial by the Italian government that human rights violations take place in \nLampedusa holding centre,6 the United Nations\u2019 Human Rights Committee (CCPR) \nexpressed concern about the conditions of detention and procedures there.  It called on \nItaly to keep the Committee closely informed about the ongoing administrative and \njudicial inquiries on matters of detention conditions, procedural irregularities and \ncollective deportations to Libya.7\n \n Given the seriousness of the numerous allegations \nraised by NGOs, a delegation of twelve MEPs, part of the Committee on Citizens\u2019 \nFreedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) of the European Parliament, \narrived on the island of Lampedusa on 15th and 16th September 2005 in order to assess \nthe identification and removal procedures, the treatment of the detainees and the \nrunning of the CPTA. Following this visit, the EP called on the European \nCommission to ensure that the Member States comply with their obligations under EU \nlaw.  \n \nLibya and the case of collective expulsions  \n \nBetween October 2004 and March 2005, Italian authorities returned more than 1500 \nirregular migrants and asylum seekers to Libya from Lampedusa holding centre. The \nbiggest operation took place between the 1st and 7th of October 2004, four days before \nthe EU lifted its eight-year-long arms embargo on Libya on 11th October 2004. During \nthose six days, a total of 1153 irregular migrants and asylum seekers were expelled to \nLibya. No information is available concerning the whereabouts of migrants and \n 11 \nasylum seekers expelled to Libya. Human Rights Watch believes that the majority has \nbeen detained in Libyan detention camps (HRW 2005: 373). \n \nSince 2000, Italy and Libya have developed a close collaboration on issues of \nirregular migration. Beginning with a general agreement to fight terrorism, organized \ncrime and illegal migration in 2000, the collaboration extended in 2003 and 2004 to \ninclude a readmission agreement, border guard training programmes, the construction \nof detention centres and the funding of deportation schemes. In 2003 and 2004 Italy \nfinanced the construction of three detention centres for irregular migrants in Libya, as \nwell as a programme of charter flights for the repatriation of irregular migrants from \nLibya to West Africa (EC 2005: 61-62). Future detention and expulsion schemes are \nbeing developed in collaboration with IOM, a key partner for both Italian and Libyan \ngovernments. Following the agreement signed on the 9th August 2005 for opening of \nan IOM office in Tripoli,8\n \n IOM and Libya defined a programme of activities with the \naim of supporting the Libyan Government to counter illegal migration and develop a \nlong-term migration management approach. Under the Programme for the \nEnhancement of Transit and Irregular Migration Management (TRIM), IOM will be \nresponsible for:  \n\uf0a7 Labour selection programmes for migrant workers in order to supply Libya\u2019s \nlabour demand; \n\uf0a7 Information campaigns to warn potential migrants about the dangers of \nirregular migration; \n\uf0a7 Improvement of services (such as heath care) and conditions of detention for \nirregular migrants in detention centres in Libya; \n 12 \n\uf0a7 Development of an Assisted Voluntary Return Programme (AVR) and \nReinsertion programme aiming to return irregular migrants in Libya to their \ncountries of origin; \n\uf0a7 Strengthening of cooperation on irregular migration between origin and \ndestination countries (EC 2005: 15).    \n \nNGOs claim that the signing of the bilateral agreement between Libya and Italy in \nAugust 2004 led to widespread arrests in Libya of individuals from sub-Saharan \nAfrica,9\n \n and that 106 migrants lost their lives during subsequent repatriations from \nLibya to Niger (Gatti 2005b). Evidence gathered by Amnesty International (AI) points \nfurther to the risk that removed asylum seekers and irregular migrants face in Libya. \nAs AI documented, in Libya migrants and asylum seekers in particular are often \nvictims of arbitrary detention, inexistent or unfair trials, killings, and disappearances \nand torture in the detention camps (AI 2004). Once migrants and asylum seekers are \ndetained in Libya there is virtually no way for NGOs to assist them or verify the \nconditions of detention or the expulsion procedures as UNHCR cannot operate its \nprotection mandate in Libya.   \nIn light of gathered data on current removal practices, a coalition of 13 European \nNGOs proposed to the Member States and the EU a number of core principles to be \napplied during the repatriations in order to ensure that the policies fully respect the \nneeds and dignity of individuals.10\n \n In the complaint filed with the European \nCommission concerning the expulsions from Lampedusa holding centre to Libya, the \nNGOs called onto the Commission to sanction Italy for: \n 13 \n\uf0a7 Violation of the prohibition of collective expulsions provided for in article 4 of \nthe 4th Protocol of the European Charter of Human Rights (ECHR) and \nfundamental freedoms, and article II-19-1 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights \nand article 13 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights \n\uf0a7 Violation of the non-refoulement principle11 prescribed in article 33 of the 1951 \nGeneva Convention on Refugees and Article 3 of the Convention against \nTorture12\n \n \nItalian authorities have responded to the allegations of collective expulsions by \ninvoking article 10 of Law 189\/2002 and in particular the procedures regarding the \nrefusal of entry (respingimento alla frontiera). The authorities claim that removals \nfrom the Lampedusa CPTA are not expulsions but rather refusals of entry on an \nindividual basis. An expulsion needs to be decided by the judge and prohibits entry \ninto Italy for ten years while a refusal of entry is an administrative measure that does \nnot ban the migrant from entering the Italian territory in the future. Italian authorities \ninsist that the refusals of entry take place on a case-by-case basis and that since the \nmajority of migrants reaching Lampedusa are economic migrants rather than refugees, \nItaly is not in violation of the non-refoulement principle or in breach of the Geneva \nConvention.13\n \n  \nIn its observations on Italy during its 85th Session in Geneva in November 2005, the \nUN Human Rights Committee raised the issue of the right to international protection \nand recalled the right of each person not to be expelled to a country where he\/she \nmight face torture or ill-treatment. Along similar lines, while the European Court of \nHuman Rights14 sought clarification from Italian authorities on identification and \n 14 \nexpulsion procedures followed, the European Parliament called on Italy to refrain \nfrom collective expulsions to Libya. In its Resolution on Lampedusa the EP took the \nview that these expulsions constitute a violation of the principle of non-refoulement. \nEP also called on Libya to allow access to international observers, halt the expulsions \nand arbitrary arrests of migrants, ratify the Geneva Convention and recognize the \nmandate of the UNHCR.  \n \n \nMisrepresentation of migratory flows to Italy  \n \nThe Italian Government considers the detentions in the Lampedusa CPTA and the \nsuccessive expulsions to Libya to be indispensable measures for countering the \nemergency caused by the influx of people from Libya and for deterring \u2018a million \nillegal migrants\u2019 waiting on Libyan shores from crossing over to Italy.15\n \n At first \nglance, the image of \u2018a million illegal migrants\u2019 might express the Italian State\u2019s \ndifficulty in managing large-scale migration from the South. The expression, \nhowever, merits a more serious consideration because it brings together a number of \nmisconceptions that inform Italy\u2019s migratory policies: it inflates the numbers so as to \nproduce the imagery of invasion, assumes that entries via the southern border \nconstitute the majority of Italy\u2019s undocumented migrants and conveys the image that \nthe bulk of migratory flows in and through Libya is clandestine and headed towards \nEurope.  \nAs for the migration from Eastern Europe during the 1990s \u2013to which scholars now \nrefer as \u2018the invasion that never took place\u2019 (Simoncini 2000)\u2014 so for the current \n 15 \nmigration to Italy via Libya. The reference to the magnitude of migratory flows \ninvokes the fantasy of invasion from the South. The existing data offer however a \ndifferent image of migratory flows towards Italy. The recent report from the Italian \nMinistry of Internal Affairs indicates that the majority of third-country nationals \nresiding illegally in the country have reached Italy neither via sea nor having crossed \nits borders undocumented. They have on the contrary, entered the county at its land \nborders with a valid entry clearance and have become undocumented either once their \nvisa expired or after they overstayed their permit of residence. According to the same \nsource, only 10% of undocumented migrants currently residing in Italy entered the \ncountry \u2018illegally\u2019 via its sea borders (Caritas\/Migrantes 2005).  \n \nThe arrival of circa 10,500 migrants and asylum seekers to the island of Lampedusa in \n2004 certainly represents a heavy load for a small island of 20km\u00b2 with a population \nof 5500. Yet, if we exaggerate the numbers and assume for analytical purposes only \nthat all of 10,500 migrants are asylum seekers, this would certainly provoke a sharp \nincrease in numbers of asylum seekers and refugees in Italy from 901916 to more than \nits double. What might appear at a first glance as a worrisome perspective needs to be \nviewed in proportion to the national population size. The 9019 applications filed in \n2004 translate roughly to Italy receiving 16 asylum seekers per 100,000 inhabitants.17 \nEven if doubled, the total number of requests for asylum in Italy would be of 34 per \n100,000 and hence still remain below the EU average of 60 asylum seekers per \n100,000 inhabitants.18 While this increase is a hypothetical one, it is nevertheless \nuseful as to illustrate the gap between asylum trends in Italy and other EU countries \nand to point to Italy\u2019s reluctance to take on its share of asylum responsibilities within \nthe EU. In fact, by not registering the \u2018illegal\u2019 entries Italy avoids the application of \n 16 \nthe Dublin II Regulation, namely its duty to determine the asylum application as the \nresponsibility for the examination of an asylum application lies with the member state \nwhere a link with the asylum seeker was first established.19\n \n    \nAn example of this reluctance is the earlier discussed fact that the Italian authorities \nmaintain that migrants arriving from Libya to Lampedusa are economic migrants \nrather than asylum seekers. They refer to all of them as illegal migrants. Since the \nLibyan government does not recognize the category of asylum seekers and since the \nauthorities of Lampedusa CPTA allegedly fail to assess migrants\u2019 nationality and \nclassify the majority as Egyptians, there is no record which would permit a systematic \nidentification of migrants\u2019 countries of origin. If such a record was available, it would \nindicate that refugees are indeed part of migratory flows that transit Libya. This can \nbe seen clearly in the case of Malta where the majority of new arrivals in 2004 were \nfrom the conflict affected countries of Eritrea, Ivory Coast, Sudan and Somalia (Pliez \n2005).  \n \nLibya\u2019s migratory reality is that it is far from being either a country of massive \nemigration or that is exclusively a transit route for clandestine migrants from Sub-\nSaharan Africa to Italy. On the contrary, Libya is in firstly a destination country and \nthe major country of immigration in the Maghreb. Foreign nationals constitute \napproximately 25 to 30% of Libya\u2019s total population. Large-scale economic and \nsocial development schemes in the 1970s, launched thanks to the revenues from the \npetroleum industry, relied in the first instance on migrant labourers from Egypt. \nEgyptian nationals, employed mainly in the agricultural industry and education, \nconstitute today the largest migrant group in Libya (Hamood 2006). Libya is home \n 17 \nalso to a large Maghrebi community (Morocco, Tunis and Alger) and the country\u2019s \neconomic development relies on cheap and seasonal labour from the neighbouring \ncountries of Niger, Chad and Sudan (Boubakri 2004; Pliez 2005). Since the 1990s, the \npresence of migrant workers from sub-Saharan states has been prompted by Libya\u2019s \nreorientation from pan-Arab to pan-African policy and its active role in the foundation \nof the Community of Sahel-Saharan states (CEN-SAD) which, as an economic project \ngrounded in the free circulation of people and goods between its member states, is \noriented towards regional cooperation and integration. Migrant workers from Sudan, \nChad and Niger are generally present in the Libyan Saharan border areas where they \nwork in sectors such as agriculture, tourism and local trade. These labour migrations, \nfacilitated by an open border policy towards sub-Saharan Africa are of seasonal and \npendular character rather than, as commonly assumed, the source of irregular \nmigratory movements to Europe. \n \nInflating the numbers relative to the migratory flows to Italy from Libya, as some \npoliticians and elements of the mass media have done, results in an erroneous and \nmisleading representation of Libya\u2019s migratory history and of the contemporary \nmigration in the Mediterranean area. Images such as a \u2018million illegal migrants\u2019 \nproduce and manipulate the fear of invasion through a distorted account of migratory \npatterns in Libya and conceal Italy\u2019s reluctance to admit asylum seekers and refugees \nto its territory and, atypically for an EU state, its failure to pass an organic law on the \nright to asylum that has been under discussion since the 2002. \n \n \nThe production of illegal migration \n 18 \n \nMuch attention has been given to collective expulsion of third-country nationals from \nLampedusa CPTA to Libya in terms of the \u2018externalisation\u2019 of asylum. \nExternalisation refers to the propensity of several EU Member States to establish \ncentres for processing asylum applications outside the EU\u2019s external borders. \nDeportations from Lampedusa to Libya occurred in fact in a highly charged political \natmosphere surrounding the proposal to set up refugee processing centres in North \nAfrica. The proposal, advanced initially by the Blair government, included \u2018Regional \nProcessing Areas\u2019 (RPAs) and \u2018Transit Processing Centres\u2019 (TPCs); the former were \nto be located in the zones of origin of refugees with the aim of strengthening reception \ncapacities close to areas of crisis, and the latter, positioned closer to EU borders, were \nenvisioned as centres where asylum seekers could submit their asylum claims (Noll \n2003). Even though the proposal was rejected by several EU member states, concerns \nabout \u2018externalisation\u2019 to Libya remained strong, as in October 2004 the informal EU \nJustice and Home Affairs Council debated the implementation of five pilot projects in \nLibya and several other North-West African countries with the aim of upgrading \nexisting detention facilities and developing asylum systems.20\n \n     \nOn the basis of this chronology of events, it is tempting to identify the collective \nexpulsions from Lampedusa to Libya in terms of the externalisation of asylum. The \nfact that third-country nationals are precluded from presenting asylum claims, \nremoved from Lampedusa to Libya and then most likely placed in the detention \nfacilities financed by the Italian Government, might indeed seem to constitute the \nexternalisation of asylum. The idea of externalisation presupposes however that \nasylum seekers and refugees are relocated to facilities where they are granted \n 19 \nprotection and where they can access the asylum determination procedure. Since the \nexternal processing centres do not yet exist and since Libya in practice has no refugee \npolicy, Italy\u2019s expulsion of third-country nationals to Libya constitutes a retraction of \nthe right to asylum rather than its externalisation.21\n \n As such, the policy of expulsions \ncarries the risk of being counterproductive. Whereas the expulsions are carried out as \na deterrent for undocumented migration, the obstacles to filing an asylum request are \nlikely to increase irregular migration. In fact, those who would otherwise seek asylum \nmight become irregular migrants due to the effective impossibility in accessing the \nasylum procedure (Hamood 2006: 33-46).  \nThe deterrence of unwanted migration from Africa, the core element of Italian-Libyan \ncooperation on irregular migration, extends further to border guard training and the \nsupply of devices and equipment requested by the Libyan authorities to achieve a \nbetter control of the country\u2019s sea and land borders, in particular those with Sub-\nSaharan Africa. These measures are inter alia geared towards combating the \nsmuggling of migrants and preventing further loss of lives at sea due to overcrowded \nboats and smugglers\u2019 negligence. While well intended, the idea of strengthening \nborder controls in order to prevent smuggling and trafficking in migrants can yield \nparadoxical consequences. The case of the EU\u2019s enlargement eastward showed that \nstricter immigration controls aimed at preventing trafficking do not necessarily protect \nmigrants from abuse but might foster migrants\u2019 vulnerability to violence during travel, \nincrease the costs of \u2018doing business\u2019 for traffickers and leave ample space for third \nparties\u2019 profiteering and abuse (Andrijasevic 2007; Salt and Stein 1997).  \n \n 20 \nFollowing the EC\u2019s technical mission to Libya in 2004 and the follow up mission led \nby FRONTEX22\n \n in 2007, experts confirmed that many migrants from these countries \nsettled in the southern cities of the Libyan desert without the intention of further \ntransit to Europe (EC 2005; FRONTEX 2007). Libya\u2019s open border policy towards \nsub-Saharan Africa is a key point in the regional integration of Sahelian Africa. \nStrengthening the control at the border between Libya and its sub-Saharan African \nneighbours is likely to create obstacles to the free movement of people and illegalise \nthe region\u2019s seasonal labour migration (Maccanico 2005). The little data available \nfrom Libya confirm these findings. It is therefore puzzling that in its attempt to reduce \nirregular migratory flows into Libya and further into the EU, the FRONTEX-led EU \ntechnical mission to Libya focused exclusively on increasing the control of Libya\u2019s \nsouthern borders and on providing Libya with technical support and equipment as to \nstrengthen the surveillance of southern desert regions (FRONTEX 2007).  \nFollowing the signing of the bilateral agreement between Italy and Libya in August \n2004, journalistic sources reported that Libyan authorities targeted sub-Saharan \nAfricans with arrests, detentions and deportations (Gatti 2005b). These allegations \nwere confirmed by the EC\u2019s technical mission to Libya during which experts verified \nthat recent arrests and detentions were often of arbitrary nature and affected migrants \nfrom Niger, Ghana and Mali who have been working in Libya for more than a decade \n(EC 2005: 31-35). The operations of repatriation expose migrants to various type of \nabuse such as financial profiteering as following the increase in arrests and expulsions \nthird parties who organize travel have allegedly tripled the price of the journey out of \nLibya; theft by third parties who steal migrants\u2019 belongings and leave them in the \ndesert; labour exploitation as migrants who run out of money during the journey get \n 21 \nstuck in various settlements in the desert where they their work under harsh conditions \nin exchange for food and shelter; and death due to overcrowding in lorries or lack of \nwater (Gatti 2005b). While more substantial figures on the impact of current \nimmigration policies on migrants\u2019 lives in Libya are still missing, the data gathered so \nfar suggest that the measures geared towards curbing irregular migration are likely to \nincrease migrants\u2019 vulnerability and the involvement of third parties due to the rise in \nprofit to be made from smuggling activities (Koslowski 2001).  \n \nThe conditions of \u2018illegality\u2019 are however not only produced as a result of expulsions \nto or tightening of immigration control in Libya. While most of the attention so far \nhas been paid to the implications of collective removals from Lampedusa to Libya, \nthe fact that the majority of the irregular migrants and asylum seekers are transferred \nfrom Lampedusa CPTA to other Italian CPTAs went overlooked. This continuous \ndetention follows the logic intrinsic to CPTAs\u2019 constitution, namely that detention is \nindispensable to ensure an effective removal policy. The data that appeared in the \nreport from Italy\u2019s Audit Court undermine the argument that CPTAs are a key means \nfor effective functioning of expulsions. The report shows in fact that out of 11883 \nirregular migrants detained in Italian CPTAs in 2004, less than half were deported \nwhile the rest escaped or were released after the expiration of the maximum detention \nperiod. Since the majority of migrants are actually released from the CPTAs after they \nhave been served a removal order, scholars have suggested we view detention camps \nnot as institutions geared towards deportations but rather as sites that on the one hand, \nfunction as a filter mechanism for the selective inclusion of certain groups of migrants \nand on the other, produce \u2018illegality\u2019 and hence the condition of \u2018deportability\u2019 \n(Andrijasevic 2008; Mezzadra 2004; Papadopoulos, Stephenson and Tsianos 2008).  \n 22 \nThis reasoning is of great relevance in particular for the asylum seekers transferred \nfrom Lampedusa CPTA to another Italian CPTA: asylum seekers\u2019 detention becomes \nin fact mandatory only after they have been served a refusal of entry order in \nLampedusa. Moreover, once released from a CPTA with the order to leave Italy, \nasylum seekers find themselves in an irregular situation: if they overstay the period of \nfive days within which they must leave the country, they are susceptible to \nincarceration on the basis of having committed an offence by failing to observe the \nexpulsion order (FIDH 2005).   \n \nAs research has shown in several instances, border controls, detentions and expulsion \npractices do not prevent people from moving from their countries of origin, nor from \nreaching Europe, but rather they raise the costs and dangers of migration. The alarmist \nportrayals that invoke the image of a massive influx of undocumented entries from \nLibya to Italy hinder a correct understanding of existing migratory patterns and the \nresponsibility of the states in reducing legal channels of migration and impeding \naccess to asylum so that in contemporary times illegality has become a structural \ncharacteristic of migratory flows (Mezzadra 2001).  \n \n \nRenounced Responsibilities: the EU framework \n \nAs well as being matters for Italy\u2019s national legislation and initiative, the return of \nillegal third-country nationals from Lampedusa holding centre and the collaboration \nwith Libya on migration issues are also regulated by the EU framework. The EU \nDirective on Return and the Action Plan on Libya (both still to be finalized) are part \n 23 \nof the agenda to establish a comprehensive Community policy on immigration and \nasylum. The EU Return Directive provides a minimum set of procedural and legal \nsafeguards for third-county nationals residing illegally in EU Member States \nconcerning their return, removal and custody.23\n \n Once in force, by prioritising \nvoluntary return over forced removal, by providing for a right to an effective judicial \nremedy with suspensive effect against return decisions and removal orders, and by \nlimiting the use of temporary custody to the cases that present the risk of absconding, \nthe Directive would legally oblige the authorities of the Lampedusa holding centre to \nrevise their removal practices in accordance with the standards set by the EU. \nHowever, it is very likely that the Directive will not affect the situation and \nprocedures in Lampedusa given the fact that the holding centre has a special status, \nnamely, that of a clearing station (AI 2005). In fact, according to the Article 2.2 of the \nReturn Directive, the Member States are not obliged to apply the directive to the third-\ncountry nationals who have been refused entry in a transit zone of a Member State. \nClassifying Lampedusa holding centre as a clearing station therefore circumvents the \nReturn Directive and relieves Italian authorities of the obligation to bring removal \npractices in Lampedusa in line with common EU standards.  \nThe discussions between the European Union and Libya regarding migration \nmanagement have intensified throughout 2005 and are currently directed towards \ndrawing a Joint Action Plan. Developed under the framework of the external \ndimension of the common European asylum and immigration policy laid out by the \nHague programme with the aim of integrating asylum into EU\u2019s external relations \nwith third countries, the cooperation between the EU and Libya is geared towards \ndefining operational measures to counter illegal migration. The Joint Action Plan that \n 24 \nis currently being drafted outlines inter alia the enhancement of border control at \nLibya\u2019s sea, southern land and air borders, training of Libyan law enforcement \nofficers including a thematic programme on asylum, refurbishment of detention \ncamps and dialogue with main countries of origin as the main components of the EU-\nLibyan partnership. Given the fact that Libya does not have a functioning asylum \nsystem in place and that it is not party to the Geneva Convention, the Action Plan \nproposes to limit the EU\u2019s intervention as far as detention centres are concerned to the \nprovision of health care and advice and to postpone assistance for return operations \nuntil conditionality requirements ensuring adequate protection of refugees are met by \nLibya.  \n \nThe EU Return Directive and the Action Plan on Libya are both new instruments and \nboth need to be finalized. Despite ample evidence of procedural irregularities and \nallegations of collective expulsions from Lampedusa holding centre, the \nCommission\u2019s Proposal for a Return Directive gives Member States the possibility of \nnot applying the Directive in transit zones. In a similar manner, the EU also went \nahead to develop cooperation on irregular migration with Libya despite evidence of \nhuman rights violations there, no guarantee of refugee rights and no official \nrecognition of UNHCR protection mandate. Moreover, while the draft of the Action \nPlan specifies that no EU funding will be provided for return until the conditionality \nrequirements are met, it does not mention any limitations to be imposed on bilateral \nagreements on return such as the one between Italy and Libya. Hence, the EU Return \nDirective and the Action Plan both strengthen Member States\u2019 discretion and leave \nample space for the states, in this case Italy, to apply the exception (Balzacq and \nCarrera 2005). The wide discretion available for the application of restrictive \n 25 \nexceptions undermines the credibility of the Commission\u2019s monitoring responsibility \nand the EU\u2019s commitment to protect refugees.  \n \nThe issue of the Commission\u2019s responsibility as far as the right of asylum is \nconcerned is further raised by its co-financing of the TRIM programme in Libya.24 \nUnder the TRIM Programme, developed and implemented by the IOM, the \nCommission is funding IOM to improve the services and conditions of detention for \nirregular migrants in detention centres,25\n \n to develop a so-called Assisted Voluntary \nReturn Programme (AVR) and Reinsertion programme to support irregular migrants \nin returning to their countries of origin, and to strengthen cooperation on irregular \nmigration between origin and destination countries (EC 2005: 15). Contrary to its \ncommitment not to assist Libya financially with repatriations, the Commission is de \nfacto funding a return scheme for the repatriation of irregular migrants and asylum \nseekers via its collaboration with the IOM. Similar to Italy\u2019s expulsion of irregular \nmigrants and asylum seekers to Libya and Libya\u2019s delegation of detention and \nrepatriations matter to IOM, the Commission also contracts IOM to carry out policies \nin the field of migration and asylum as to further Commission\u2019s objectives. Yet, \ncontracting IOM does not relieve Italy or Libya from their international obligation \nunder norms prohibiting refoulement and norms protecting human rights.  \nThese considerations raise the question of responsibility as regards IOM\u2019s \ninterventions. In the case of the repatriations of those irregular migrant and asylum \nseekers who have initially been expelled from Lampedusa holding centre, IOM makes \nitself complicit in obstructing asylum seekers\u2019 right to asylum. Moreover, the fact that \nirregular migrants and asylum seekers are deported from Lampedusa without knowing \n 26 \nthat they are being transferred to Libya, that the removals are executed by force and \nthat once in Libya migrants are again detained in police-guarded structures, raises \nserious doubts that the IOM-run repatriations from Libya can be identified as \nvoluntary. When the decisions to return are made under duress or as an alternative to \nstate-run forced expulsions, \u2018voluntary\u2019 seems to designate an absence of viable \noptions rather than a deliberate choice. Like any other international organization, IOM \nmay be responsible for the violation of international legal obligations, although in the \nnature of things the range of obligations by which it is bound will differ from those \napplicable to the State.26\n \n However, in deporting irregular migrants and asylum seekers \nfrom Libya IOM is to be seen as assuming joint responsibility for any violation of \nfundamental rights asylum seekers and irregular migrants might suffer. \n \nConclusions \n \nIn the attempt to control the influx of \u2018irregular\u2019 migrants and asylum seekers to Italy \nvia Libya, the Italian government developed a number of schemes within and beyond \nits state borders. In the holding centre situated on Lampedusa, Italy\u2019s southernmost \nisland and the most frequent point of arrival in 2004 for boats departing from Libya, \nItalian authorities implemented detention and large-scale expulsion schemes that, \naccording to NGOs, affected irregular migrants and asylum-seekers alike. In order to \ncontrol the migratory flows prior to migrants reaching its territory, Italy strengthened \nits collaboration on illegal migration with Libya by signing a readmission agreement, \nrefurbishing several detention facilities and funding a repatriation scheme for irregular \nmigrants in Libya. Libya on its part increased internal checks on specific groups of \n 27 \nmigrants, in particular those originating from Sub-Saharan states, a practice resulting \nin arbitrary detentions and unsafe repatriations in which more than one hundred \npeople lost their lives.  \n \nDespite the Italian Government\u2019s denial that any human rights violations are taking \nplace in the Lampedusa holding centre, the European Parliament and the United \nNations\u2019 Human Rights Committee (UNHRC) expressed concern about the conditions \nof detention there. The EP\u2019s Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs \n(LIBE) visited the holding center in September 2005 and assessed the detention \nconditions, the running of the CPTA and the treatment of migrants. Both the European \nParliament and the UNHRC called on Italy to guarantee the individual examination of \nasylum and to refrain from collective expulsions of undocumented migrants and \nasylum-seekers to Libya. The European Parliament stated that these expulsions \nconstitute a violation of the principle of non-refoulement that prohibits the forcible \nreturn of anyone to a territory where they might be at risk of serious human rights \nviolations. To expel asylum seekers from Italy to Libya implies returning them to a \ncountry which does not recognize the mandate of the UNHCR, has no asylum system, \nis not a signatory of the Geneva Convention and in which, as NGOs documented, \nirregular migrants and asylum seekers are at risk of arbitrary detentions, unfair trails, \ndisappearance and torture while in detention. \n \nThe procedural and legal safeguards for the return, removal and custody of third-\ncountry nationals residing illegally in EU Member States and the collaboration with \nLibya on matters of illegal migration are about to be regulated through the EU Return \nDirective and by the Libya-EU Joint Action Plan. The Directive prioritizes voluntary \n 28 \nreturn over forced return, introduces the suspension against a return decision and\/or a \nremoval order, and limits temporary custody to those situations where there is a risk \nof absconding. The Action Plan, on the other hand, proposes postponing EU \nassistance for return schemes for undocumented migrants in Libya until the Libyan \nGovernment demonstrates full respect for human rights and democratic principles, \nand a commitment to fulfil its international obligations toward refugees. Despite being \ninstruments that would potentially oblige Italian authorities to revisit their detention \nand removal practices, the EU Return Directive and the Action Plan would still leave \ntoo much space for the Member States to apply restrictive exceptions and to develop \nbilateral partnerships. Wide powers are being left to the Member States to apply \nexception and develop bilateral partnerships, which in combination with the funding \nallocated to the IOM for a programme geared inter alia towards developing a \nrepatriation scheme in Libya, undermines EU efforts to achieve a common framework \non asylum and immigration, and thereby improve its credibility on refugee protection. \n \nScholars and policy analyst have approached the issue of detention and repatriation \nprogrammes outside EU borders in terms of the externalization of asylum. What this \npaper suggests however is that the implementation of detention and repatriation \nprograms in Libya, especially when considered together with the expulsions from \nLampedusa, do not actually relocate the asylum procedures outside the EU external \nborders but rather deprive asylum-seekers of the possibility of accessing the asylum \ndetermination procedure. This violation of the right to asylum is concealed by the \nimagery invoked by the politicians and the media of an impending mass arrival of \nundocumented migrants from Libya to the Italian shores. This imagery distorts the \nreality of migratory movements from Sub-Saharan Africa into Libya, which is an \n 29 \nestablished part of Libya\u2019s seasonal labour migration rather than a source of irregular \nmigration into Europe. While producing an erroneous representation of migratory \nflows in the Mediterranean region, the imagery of impending mass arrival also \nconceals Italy\u2019s reluctance to admit asylum seekers into its territory and its \nunwillingness to apply the Dublin II Regulation and assume its share of asylum \nresponsibility in the EU.  \n \nCurrent Italian-Libyan partnership indicates a new reorientation of Libyan politics \nfrom a pro-African to a pro-European stance. This change in political balances, \naccompanied by Libya\u2019s tightening of border controls towards its Sub-Saharan \nneighbours is likely to clash with the principle of free movement of people that is a \ncornerstone of regional cooperation and integration in the Sahel-Saharan region. This \nshift could destabilize the current political balances between Libya and its \nneighbouring states, and may consequently \u2018illegalize\u2019 movements of large groups of \nSub-Saharan nationals. \n \nThe implementation of detention and expulsion schemes that illegalize migratory \nmovements and impinge upon migrants\u2019 right to seek asylum brings into question the \npolitical responsibility of all actors involved, whether they are Governments, \nsupranational bodies or agencies. The Italian and Libyan governments, the European \nUnion, and the International Organization for Migration all need to assume their share \nof responsibility for the violations of rights that asylum seekers and irregular migrants \nmight suffer as a result of the measures and programmes they implement inside the \nEU and outside its borders.   \n \n 30 \nPolicy Recommendations  \n \nGiven the fact that data available on measures regarding detention and deportations of \nirregular migrants and asylum seekers in Lampedusa and Libya are often \ncontradictory and incomplete, that bilateral agreements on irregular migration remain \nundisclosed and that the European Union\u2019s framework leaves large discretion for the \nMember States to apply restrictive exceptions, this paper recommends transparency, \naccountability and legitimacy as key principles to guide Member States agenda and \nEU\u2019s partnership with neighbouring states in the field of asylum and immigration.  \n \nTransparency:  \nDeveloping a correct assessment of the situation regarding detention, expulsion and \nasylum at the EU\u2019s southern border is contingent upon gaining access to and \nrendering transparent the information, programmes and agreements that regulate \nrepatriations of irregular migrants and asylum seekers in Lampedusa and Libya. \nWhether carried out by the Italian and Libyan states or by the IOM, a lack of \ntransparency is common to the policies and schemes countering irregular migration \nfrom and into Libya. Information regarding the number, frequency and destinations of \nthe return flights from Lampedusa CPTA, the content of the bilateral agreements \nbetween Italy and Libya and between Libya and IOM, and the content of the contract \nfor the TRIM Programme co-funded by the EC must be made public in order to \nachieve a transparent Community policy on asylum and immigration. \n \nAccountability: \nWith regards to the partnership with third countries in the area of migration and \nasylum, the EU must provide leadership in terms of human rights protection. The \n 31 \ndivergent interests between national and EU competencies over borders, asylum and \nimmigration should not leave Member States with ample space to apply the exception \nthat, as in the case of the EU return directive, would result in the disregard of even the \nminimum safeguards on return. In cases where either the EU or states sub-contract to \nthe IOM this does not exempt the EU, Italy or Libya from their international legal \nobligations under norms prohibiting refoulement and norms protecting human rights. \nIOM on its part must assure that its programmes do not impinge upon the right to seek \nasylum and must be held accountable for any violations that might occur as result of \nits actions.  \n \nThe lack of safeguards and control mechanisms ensuring the right to seek asylum and \nItaly\u2019s tendency to circumvent its responsibilities on matters of asylum require an \nintervention from the European Parliament. With the co-decision on asylum and \nimmigration, the EP is directly involved in the decision-making process and needs to \npropose amendments to the Return Directive and the Action Plan on Libya with the \nobjective of achieving observance of human rights and international standards. The \nEP\u2019s intervention would play a crucial role in achieving a transparent and democratic \nprocedure as regards to a common asylum policy and would steer it towards a rights- \nrather than a control-based approach.   \n \nLegitimacy: \nHolding centres are aimed at facilitating an effective repatriation of third-country \nnationals who have entered Italy illegally. Lampedusa holding centre does not fulfil \nits main functions: it facilitates only a nominal amount of expulsions and it \nperpetuates ill-treatment rather than offering assistance. In order to ensure that \n 32 \ndetention procedures and practices are in conformity with the existing domestic and \ninternational standards, a short-term objective is to mandate an independent \nmonitoring body to make regular, unrestricted and unannounced visits there. The \nclosure of Lampedusa holding centre should constitute a long-term objective.27 Since \nit is classified as a clearing station, Italy is likely to disregard the set of minimum \nprocedural and legal safeguards on return, removal and custody provided under the \nEU Return Directive. The centre\u2019s closure would prevent future violation of \nprocedures and assure that migrants and asylum seekers rights are not sidestepped by \nthe Italian authorities.    \n 33 \nReferences: \n \nAmnesty International  \n2005  Italy: Temporary stay \u2013 Permanent rights: the treatment of foreign nationals \ndetained in \u2018temporary stay and assistance centres\u2019 (CPTAs) \n \n------------  \n2004  Libya: time to make human rights a reality, AI INDEX MDE 19\/002\/2004   \n \nAndrijasevic, R  \n2008  \u2018From Exception to Excess: Re-reading Detention and Deportations in Today\u2019s \nEurope\u2019, (eds) Nicholas de Genova and Nathalie Peutz, The Deportation Regime: \nSovereignty, Space, and the Freedom of Movement.

As a \npartner in the 5+5 Dialogue, as preceding the regional seminar on irregular migration in the western \nMediterranean in Tripoli on 8 and 9 June 2004, IOM organized in cooperation with Libya\u2019s People\u2019s \nCommittee for Public Security a training session for 100 Libyan officials and police representatives. \nThe focus of the session was on border and migration management and on assisted voluntary return for \nirregular migrants in Libya.

It prohibits the forcible return of anyone to a territory where they would be at risk of serious \nhuman rights violations: \"No contracting state shall expel or return (refouler), a refugee in any manner \nto the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, \nreligion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion\u201d. This principle \nmakes reference to the lack of individual assessments and to the removal of persons to countries where \nthere exists a serious risk to the physical integrity of those concerned (mentioned in article 19\u00a72 of the \nEuropean Charter).  \n12 Migrants and asylum seekers are deported to Libya, a country lacking minimum guarantees of \nprotection. This is in contravention with the article II-19-2 of the European Charter of Fundamental \nRights, according to which \"No one may be removed, expelled or extradited to a State where there is a \nserious risk that they may be subjected to the death penalty, torture or inhuman or degrading \ntreatment\". Italy\u2019s obligation to non-refouleur to a country lacking minimum guarantees of protection \nis reinforced by the fact that it is a party to the 1951 Refugee Convention, the UN Convention against \nTorture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the European \nConvention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. \n13 The response by Alessandro Pansa, the Director General of the immigration and border police of the \nItalian Ministry of Interior delivered to the UN Human Rights Committee during its 85th Session on the 20th \nOctober 2005.

The readers are hence asked to bear in mind that a hypothetical increase calculated \nabove concerns only requests for asylum rather than the allocation of the asylum status.  \n19 (EC) No.343\/2003, OJ L 50\/1, 25.2.2003. \n20 The Commission denied that these pilot projects are directly linked to plans to create EU reception \ncentres in North Africa.

IOM\u2019s \ninvolvement with reception centres in the north Africa dates back to 2002 when IOM, UNHCR, the \nEuropean Commission, the Netherlands and Denmark met in an informal meeting to discuss the UK\u2019s \nproposal for \u2018in the region and off-shore processing\u2019 and drafted a memorandum that set a number of \npractical, legal and financial issues concerning the external processing. IOM has already managed off-\nshore processing detention centres, such as the one set by the Australian authorities on Nauru island, \nfor which it came under attack by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, who urged it to \nstop arbitrary detention and impingement of migrants\u2019 right to seek asylum.  IOM is currently also \nresponsible for realization of two large new camps for irregular migrants in Ukraine, one of the \npotential countries to host EU\u2019s Regional Protection Programme. \n26 For summaries of the discussion on the international legal responsibility of international \norganizations in the International Law see Clapham (2006: 109-10); on the related issue of refugee \nrights in camps and settlements Goodwin-Gill, G. S. & McAdam, J., (2007: 466-71); and, International \nLaw Association (2004). \n27 The majority of Italy\u2019s Regions support the closure of the holding centres. In summer 2005, fourteen \nProvincial Governors and their representatives met at the forum Mare Aperto in Bari and drafted a \ndocument in which they undertook to launch a political-institutional dialogue geared towards changing \ncurrent Italian immigration law, closing the CPTAs, creating a comprehensive law on asylum, and \ndoing away with the administrative detention.
