S0036144599352058\n1. Introduction. The objective of this paper is to lay down a systematic complex-\nified theory of monochromatic high-frequency wave propagation. The computational\nand analytical usefulness of such a theory for real rays has been very well developed, as\ndescribed in [24]. However, it is usually only the real solutions of the eikonal equation\nthat are taken into account, with complex solutions being tacitly ignored. Moreover,\nthose few complexifications of real-ray theory that have been proposed [25, 26, 43]\nsometimes differ in their methodologies.\nWe will see that complex rays may be generated even in problems in which the\nincident field is composed of only real rays; thus, to describe fully the solution to any\nhigh-frequency wave propagation problem, we should keep in mind the possibility of\ncomplex-ray contributions. We draw particular attention to two types of problem for\nwhich the theory of complex rays is essential if we are to find even the lowest order\napproximation to the rayfield. The first concerns situations in which there are no real\nrays in some sections of space, so that the ray approximation to the solution consists\n\u2217Received by the editors January 20, 1999; accepted for publication (in revised form) February\n23, 1999; published electronically July 27, 1999.\nhttp:\/\/www.siam.org\/journals\/sirev\/41-3\/35205.html\n\u2020OCIAM, Mathematical Institute, 24\u201329 St. Giles\u2019, Oxford OX1 3LB, UK (chapman@maths.\nox.ac.uk, lawry@maths.ox.ac.uk, ejam@maths.ox.ac.uk).\n\u2021Department of Theoretical Mechanics, University of Nottingham, University Park, Nottingham\nNG7 2RD, UK (R.H.Tew@vme.ccc.nottingham.ac.uk).\n417\n418 CHAPMAN, LAWRY, OCKENDON, AND TEW\nFig. 1 A trapped bouncing-ball mode between two curved endplates.\nsolely of complex rays. An example of such a situation is the circular caustic that\nwe introduce in section 2.2 and return to throughout the paper, in which there are\nno real rays on the dark side of the caustic. A second example concerns a trapped\nbouncing-ball mode between two curved endplates, as illustrated in Figure 1. Here\nall the real rays are confined between the plates, but complex rays will be diffracted\nfrom the endpoints of the plates, which will leak an exponentially small amount of\nenergy to infinity.\nThe second type of problem concerns situations in which the incoming field itself\ncomprises complex rays. Such a situation is typified by problems involving insonifi-\ncation by Gaussian beams, which we will see in section 2.3 can be described by an\nisotropic source located at a complex point in space.\nIn many other problems, complex rays are generated but are subdominant to real\nrays, and in these cases we aim to use knowledge of complex-ray theory to describe\nthe solution to a greater accuracy. This third type of problem is typified by the prob-\nlem of total internal reflection of rays from a point source near a plane boundary,\nwhich we introduce in section 2.3 and treat by complex-ray methods in section 6. In\nthis problem the complex ray is exponentially subdominant to the real rays in one\nhalf-space but becomes of the same order near the interface. Thus the complex-ray\ncontribution is very significant there. The behavior near this boundary could alter-\nnatively be discerned through a boundary layer analysis (as in [42]), but since there\nis no singularity in the ray solution when complex rays are included, the boundary\nlayer is really artificial, and the solution to the boundary layer problem is simply the\nlocal behavior of the full ray solution including complex rays.\nA systematic procedure for describing complex rays involves not only the Wentzel\u2013\nKramers\u2013Brilbuin (WKB) and matched asymptotic expansions that underpin [24]\nbut also the more subtle theories of exponential asymptotics that have only recently\nappeared in the literature [37]. Hence the goal of the first half of this paper is both to\nexemplify situations where it is necessary to consider complex solutions of the eikonal\nON THE THEORY OF COMPLEX RAYS 419\nequation and to emphasize the pivotal role played by \u201cStokes surfaces\u201d concerning the\nphysical interpretation of these solutions. These surfaces are defined in section 4 and\nare multidimensional generalizations of the Stokes lines that are encountered when\nholomorphic functions of one variable are expanded in the neighborhood of an isolated\nessential singularity.\nSuppose a multidimensional rayfield exhibits a singular behavior, such as a caus-\ntic, that necessitates a local modification of the ray ansatz. The leading term in the\nfar-field expansion of the local asymptotic approximation will, in general, exhibit such\nan essential singularity, and thus Stokes surfaces will always exist in the vicinity of\ncaustics and other places where two or more rayfields have a ray, real or complex,\nin common. The principal attribute of the Stokes surfaces is that it is across them,\nand only across them, that subdominant solutions of the Helmholtz equation can be\n\u201cswitched on or off.\u201d This makes complex-ray tracing qualitatively different from\nreal-ray tracing over and above the obvious need for good four- (or six-) dimensional\nvisualizations. Whereas for real rays we can associate a directivity to ensure unique-\nness of a physically acceptable solution, for complex rays we must replace this with the\nidea that relevant wavefields must be switched on or off when the ray passes through\nthe Stokes surface.\nThe plan of this article is as follows. Having used some simple examples to\nmotivate our ideas in section 2, we give an informal discussion of the problems en-\ncountered in visualizing complex rays in section 3, and this allows us to build up\nto the all-important section 4, where Stokes surfaces are defined, characterized, and\nidentified in a simple example, namely, the case of a circular caustic. In section 5 we\nproceed to study the further geometrical complexity introduced by singularities in the\nexact solution to the Helmholtz equation, again by reference to a simple example. In\nsection 6 we apply the theory we have developed to some more complicated examples,\nbeginning with half-planes, where the geometry allows us to check our predictions\nagainst Fourier integrals. Our first new result concerns the prediction of complex rays\nin certain regions of real space for a physically realizable problem concerning total\ninternal reflection. More daunting is the illumination of a smooth convex scatterer\nby a plane wave where a highly intricate Stokes surface is revealed, but, despite the\npresence of creeping rays, no complex rays exist in real space. By extending our\nanalysis to complex plane wave illumination, we can, however, make new predictions\nabout a scattering problem in which complex rays exist in real space. Finally, in sec-\ntion 7, we discuss the effects of nonanalyticity of the boundaries in order to construct\na complex geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD). This is not as hard as it may\nseem because the analytic continuation inherent in our earlier discussion of smooth\nboundaries generally leads to singularities in complex space. However, we find some\nquite unexpected results concerning the Sommerfeld problem in which half-lines are\nilluminated by real or complex plane waves or Gaussian beams.\nBecause of the difficulties associated with multiple reflections, we do not con-\nsider interior problems for the Helmholtz equation in this article. However, since\nthe complexification, say, of a one-dimensional surface in two-dimensional space is a\ntwo-dimensional surface in four-dimensional space, there is no distinction in principle\nbetween interior and exterior problems, as far as complex-ray theory is concerned.\n2. Ray Theory. The way in which classical ray theory can be used to find high-\nfrequency approximate solutions to the Helmholtz equation has been described in\nmany places [24, 1, 27] (see also references given therein). The ray equations for\nscalar, time-harmonic wave propagation with real wavenumber k arise by applying a\n420 CHAPMAN, LAWRY, OCKENDON, AND TEW\nWKB ansatz\n\u03c6 \u223c eiku(x)\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\ninAn(x)\nkn\n(1)\nto the Helmholtz equation\n\u22072\u03c6+ k2N(x)2\u03c6 = 0(2)\nin the limit k \u2192 \u221e, where N is the refractive index. This results in the eikonal\nequation\n(\u2207u)2 = N(x)2(3)\nand the recursive system of transport equations\n2\u2207A0 \u00b7 \u2207u+A0\u22072u = 0,(4)\n2\u2207An \u00b7 \u2207u+An\u22072u = \u22072An\u22121, n \u2265 1.(5)\nThe system is closed by imposing suitable boundary conditions, including appropriate\nbehavior at infinity if necessary. Such data may be given on a surface S parametrized\nby s, x = x0(s), and a radiation or extinction condition at infinity will select the\nbranch of u that is physically appropriate.\nIn this paper we will be concerned almost exclusively with the case of a uniform,\ntwo-dimensional medium for which N(x) \u2261 1, for ease of exposition (although exten-\nsions of our results to three dimensions and for variable refractive indices is possible).\nIn this case, (2) and (3) become\n\u22072\u03c6+ k2\u03c6 = 0,(6)\n(\u2207u)2 = 1,(7)\nand, if u = u0(s) is given on S, then the characteristic equations are\n\u2202p\n\u2202t\n= 0,\n\u2202q\n\u2202t\n= 0,\n\u2202x\n\u2202t\n= p,\n\u2202y\n\u2202t\n= q,\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n= 1,\nwhere (p, q) = \u2207u and t represents distance along a characteristic. These may be\nintegrated to give p = p0(s), q = q0(s), and\nx = p0(s)t+ x0(s),(8)\ny = q0(s)t+ y0(s),(9)\nu = t+ u0(s),(10)\nwhere p0 and q0 are determined from the conditions\np20 + q\n2\n0 = 1,(11)\ndx0\nds\np0 +\ndy0\nds\nq0 =\ndu0\nds\n,(12)\nwith whichever choice of branch is needed ultimately to give a physically acceptable\nsolution.\nAssuming s, t, u0, p0, and q0 are real, we see that the characteristics, which are\nthe \u201crays\u201d of ray theory, are straight lines in this case. Clearly, points where the\nJacobian\nJ =\n\u2202(x, y)\n\u2202(s, t)\nON THE THEORY OF COMPLEX RAYS 421\nvanishes will be of interest, since at these points the map between (s, t) and (x, y)\ncannot be inverted and there is therefore a singularity in u. We find\nJ =\np\u20320\nq0\n(t+ \u03b2(s)),(13)\nwhere\n\u03b2(s) =\nq0\np\u20320\n(x\u20320q0 \u2212 y\u20320p0) ,(14)\nand the prime represents d\/ds. Hence, unless p\u20320 \u2261 0, which can occur only if the\nsolution represents a plane wave, such a singularity will always exist, although it may\nnot be in physical space. The noninvertibility of the map at t = \u2212\u03b2(s) corresponds\nto a caustic of the wavefield.\nTo see the implication of this singularity for the amplitude A0, let us turn to the\ntransport equations (4), (5), which we may write as ordinary differential equations\nalong the rays:\n2\n\u2202A0\n\u2202t\n+\u22072uA0 = 0,(15)\n2\n\u2202An\n\u2202t\n+\u22072uAn = \u22072An\u22121, n \u2265 1.(16)\nFrom (8), (9) we find\n\u2202s\n\u2202x\n=\nq20\np\u20320(t+ \u03b2)\n,(17)\n\u2202s\n\u2202y\n=\np20\nq\u20320(t+ \u03b2)\n,(18)\n\u2202t\n\u2202x\n= p0 +\np0(y\u20320 \u2212 q\u20320\u03b2)\nq\u20320(t+ \u03b2)\n,(19)\n\u2202t\n\u2202y\n= q0 +\nq0(x\u20320 \u2212 p\u20320\u03b2)\np\u20320(t+ \u03b2)\n.(20)\nHence\n\u22072u = \u2202p\n\u2202x\n+\n\u2202q\n\u2202y\n=\n\u2202p\n\u2202s\n\u2202s\n\u2202x\n+\n\u2202q\n\u2202s\n\u2202s\n\u2202y\n=\n1\nt+ \u03b2\n=\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n(log J).(21)\nLetting a0(s) be the boundary value of A0, (15) then gives\nA0(s, t) =\n(\n\u03b2(s)\nt+ \u03b2(s)\n)1\/2\na0(s)(22)\nor equivalently\nA0(s, t)2J(s, t) = a0(s)2j(s),(23)\nwhere j(s) = J(s, 0) is the boundary value of J ; thus the singularity in the phase u\nat t + \u03b2(s) = 0 leads to an unbounded amplitude and hence to a breakdown of the\nray ansatz (1).\nFrom (22) we see that another kind of singularity occurs when \u03b2 = 0, i.e., at\npoints where the caustic meets the boundary t = 0 and the corresponding amplitude\n422 CHAPMAN, LAWRY, OCKENDON, AND TEW\nis undefined.

Inner diffraction problems are also necessary at singular points\nof the boundary data, for example, at corners.\nWe conclude this section by recording a representation of An that is especially\nconvenient for the asymptotic analysis of section 4.

Setting\nv = kw in (39) gives\n\u03c6(x, y) =\nk\n2pi\n\u222b (\u222b\nA0(s)eik(u0(s)+sw) ds\n)\neik(\n\u221a\n1\u2212w2y\u2212xw) dw.(40)\n424 CHAPMAN, LAWRY, OCKENDON, AND TEW\nIn many situations the dominant contribution to the first integral as k \u2192 \u221e comes\nfrom the saddle point s = s0(w), where w = \u2212u\u20320(s0(w)). Applying the method of\nsteepest descents gives\n\u03c6(x, y) \u223c\n\u222b\nK(w)eikf(w) dw,(41)\nwhere\nf(w) = u0(s0(w)) + ws0(w) +\n\u221a\n1\u2212 w2y \u2212 wx,(42)\nK(w) = \u00b51A0(s0(w))\n\u221a\nk\n2piu\u2032\u20320(s0(w))\n,(43)\nand \u00b51 is a constant independent of s0 and k. The dominant contribution to \u03c6 as\nk \u2192\u221e therefore comes from the saddle point w = w0, where\ns0(w0)\u2212 x\u2212 w0y\u221a\n1\u2212 w20\n= 0(44)\nor equivalently\ns0(w0)\u2212 x+ u\n\u2032\n0(s0(w0))y\u221a\n1\u2212 (u\u20320(s0(w0)))2\n= 0.(45)\nThis may be compared with the result of eliminating t from the ray solution (36),\n(37), viz.,\ns\u2212 x+ u\n\u2032\n0(s)y\u221a\n1\u2212 (u\u20320(s))2\n= 0.(46)\nHence we see that the point of emergence from the boundary (s, say) of the ray passing\nthrough (x, y) is related to the saddle points of the double integral in (40) through\ns = s0(w0). Finally, applying the method of steepest descents to (41) and using this\nresult we find\n\u03c6 \u223c \u00b52K(w0)\n\u221a\n2pi\nkf \u2032\u2032(w0)\neiku,(47)\nwhere\nu = u0(s)\u2212 su\u20320(s)\u2212\n\u221a\n1\u2212 (u\u20320(s))2y + u\u20320(s)x(48)\n= u0(s) + t(49)\nand \u00b52 is another constant independent of k. Thus the ray approximation to the\nHelmholtz equation is often equivalent to an application of the method of steepest\ndescents applied to the Fourier transform solution, should one exist. We now see\none way of thinking of complex rays.1 A complex value of s, corresponding to a ray\ncoming from a point on the complexified boundary, corresponds to a complex saddle\npoint in the first integral in (40).\n1We will mention complex rays several times in the following pages but we defer a precise defi-\nnition until section 3.\nON THE THEORY OF COMPLEX RAYS 425\nFig. 2 Trapped mode in a duct whose rays form a circular caustic.\n2.2. Caustics. Since caustics are ubiquitous features of ray theory, and since\nthey are the simplest example of the breakdown of a ray approach, we now examine\ntheir structure in more detail. This analysis will also provide a motivation for our\nsystematic treatment of complex rays, which will follow in section 3.\nConsider the ray solution (considered previously in [20])\nx = cos s\u2212 t sin s,(50)\ny = sin s+ t cos s,(51)\nu = s+ t.(52)\nAs with all the examples to be considered subsequently in this paper, this solution\nimplies that u is a multivalued function of (x, y) and that, in fact, there are two real\nrays through any point in x2 + y2 > 1. The rayfield may be identified with the exact\nsolution\n\u03c6(r, \u03b8) = Jk(kr)eik\u03b8(53)\nof the Helmholtz equation, where k is a large integer and r, \u03b8 are plane polar coor-\ndinates. We may consider such a solution to arise from an incident field imposed at\ninfinity or as corresponding to a trapped mode in a circularly cylindrical duct; the\ngeometry is shown in Figure 2.\nIt is not difficult to show that in this case \u03b1 = 1, \u03b2 = 0 so that the curve t = 0,\nx = cos s, y = sin s is a caustic of the ray field. The leading-order amplitude is given\nby A0 = 1\/(\u2212t)1\/2, which, as we have already seen, tends to infinity as the caustic is\napproached. Hence the ray expansion (50)\u2013(52) is valid only for t < 0 (i.e., before a\ngiven ray reaches the caustic), and, to determine the \u201coutgoing\u201d wavefield that results\non passing the caustic, it is necessary to consider a local problem in the vicinity of\nthe caustic and match this to the incoming and outgoing wavefields, as described in\n[8, 31].\nThe symmetry of the problem means that we can invert the map (50), (51) be-\ntween (s, t) and (x, y) to give\nt = \u2212\n\u221a\nr2 \u2212 1,(54)\ns = \u03b8 + cos\u22121(1\/r),(55)\n426 CHAPMAN, LAWRY, OCKENDON, AND TEW\nwhere r and \u03b8 are polar coordinates and r > 1.

We see that this ray matches\nexactly with the outgoing ray of the outer ray expansion, with only one slight techni-\ncality. The phase change of pi\/2 comes about from t going from negative to positive in\nON THE THEORY OF COMPLEX RAYS 427\nthe amplitude A0 = 1\/(\u2212t)1\/2. Matching with the inner region tells us which branch\nof the square root to take for t > 0.\nReturning to the ray solution (50)\u2013(51), we note that there are no real rays pass-\ning through any interior point x2 + y2 < 1. From (54)\u2013(55) we see that values of\nr < 1 correspond to complex values of s and t. For each interior point there are two\nvalues of s and t. Hence there are two possible complex rays\u2014one yielding an unphys-\nical exponentially large amplitude, which is discarded, and the other providing the\nexponentially small contribution that matches into the inner caustic region through\ncondition (i) above.\n2.3. Motivation for Complex Rays. The purpose of this section is to show that,\nas in the case of caustics, there are many practical problems in which the notion of\na complex ray arises naturally. We shall do this using a number of examples from\nacoustic wave propagation.\nSubsonic Surface Ray Excitation. A surface ray is one that is confined near the bound-\nary of a wavebearing medium. An example is a creeping ray, initiated as a result of\na ray at grazing incidence on a scatterer (to be discussed later), or a \u201cfree mode,\u201d\nwhich is a solution of the homogeneous versions of both field equation and associated\nboundary condition. We discuss this second case by considering the homogeneous\n\u201cimpedance\u201d problem\n(\u22072 + k2)\u03c6 = 0, y > 0,(65)\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202y\n+ \u00b5k\u03c6 = 0, y = 0,(66)\n\u03c6\u2192 0 as y \u2192\u221e,(67)\nwhere \u00b5 > 0 is an O(1) constant. The plane wave solution of this system is\n\u03c6 = A exp\n(\nik\n\u221a\n1 + \u00b52x\u2212 \u00b5ky\n)\n, y > 0,(68)\nfor any constant A, which is a wave propagating without decay along the boundary\ny = 0 with a phase speed less than the wave speed of the bulk medium and with\nstrong decay in y > 0. The corresponding ray solution is\nx =\n\u221a\n1 + \u00b52t+ s,(69)\ny = i\u00b5t,(70)\nu =\n\u221a\n1 + \u00b52s+ t,(71)\nand the only rays to intersect the physical domain (x, y) \u2208 R2, y > 0, necessarily\nemerge from complex points on the boundary (i.e., s \u2208 C) and propagate a complex\ndistance before reaching the prescribed observation point (i.e., t \u2208 C). In fact, the ray\npassing through (x, y) emerges from the boundary point s = x + iy\n\u221a\n1 + \u00b52\/\u00b5 and\npropagates a \u201cdistance\u201d t = \u2212iy\/\u00b5. Hence we see straightaway that this ray structure\ncan be discerned only by analytic continuation of s, t, x, y, and the boundary data.\nAnalytic continuation is always a dangerous process and even in this trivial situa-\ntion we can encounter singular behavior when we complexify. Indeed, the plane-wave\nreflection coefficient R for a wave incident at an angle \u03b1 to the normal is\nR =\ni cos\u03b1\u2212 \u00b5\ni cos\u03b1+ \u00b5\n.(72)\nFor all real angles of incidence, R is finite and of unit modulus, implying that all the\nincident energy is radiated back into the bulk medium. Now suppose the boundary\n428 CHAPMAN, LAWRY, OCKENDON, AND TEW\nFig. 3 Reflection of a plane wave at an interface between two compressible media.\nis insonified not by a plane wave, but by the field emitted from a line source located\nat the point (x0, y0). If this source is many wavelengths distant from the boundary,\nthe problem can be analyzed asymptotically in real space, using a locally planar\napproximation for the wavefronts near the boundary (see [42]). However, such an\nanalysis will not take into account exponentially small terms that arise from the\ncomplex rays emitted from the source. These rays correspond to the outgoing source\nH\n(1)\n0 (kr), where r =\n\u221a\n(x\u2212 x0)2 + (y \u2212 y0)2 is complex, and they are given simply by\n\u03b8 = tan\u22121(y\u2212y0)\/(x\u2212x0) = constant. However, when \u03b8 is such that cos\u03b1 = i\u00b5, R is\ninfinite and, according to [23], this critically incident complex ray is precisely the one\nthat excites the surface ray described in the earlier part of this example. This surface\nfield propagates to other parts of the boundary, including the physical domain, and\nso its initiation is of considerable practical importance and it demands the solution of\na complexified diffraction problem as in [39]. Indeed, this study gives a crucial clue\nto the importance of what we will call Stokes switching, which we will return to at\nthe end of section 4.4.\nWe remark that although our presentation of the example above has required\nthe ill-posed procedure of analytic continuation, this does not contradict the well-\nposedness of the underlying boundary value problem for the Helmholtz equation.\nThe situation is analogous to that encountered when contour integration is used to\nevaluate real definite integrals; many analytic continuations of the integrand may be\npossible but, no matter what their singularity structure, the consequences of Cauchy\u2019s\ntheorem on the real axis will always be the same.\nTotal Internal Reflection. Another familiar phenomenon that illustrates the need for\na complex-ray analysis is that of total internal reflection. Consider, for example,\ntwo semi-infinite, compressible fluids separated by an interface y = 0. Denoting the\nupper and lower fluids by the suffixes 1 and 2, respectively, the problem of plane wave\nincidence is modeled by (see Figure 3)\n(\u22072 + k21)\u03c61 = 0, y > 0,(73)\n(\u22072 + k22)\u03c62 = 0, y < 0,(74)\n\u03c61 = \u03c62, y = 0,(75)\n\u2202\u03c61\n\u2202y\n= \u03bb\n\u2202\u03c62\n\u2202y\n, y = 0,(76)\nwhere ki is the wavenumber in fluid i and \u03bb is the ratio of the fluid density in region\n1 to that in region 2.\nON THE THEORY OF COMPLEX RAYS 429\nWhen we subtract out a prescribed incoming field\n\u03c6\n(inc)\n1 (x, y) = exp[ik1(x sin \u03b81 \u2212 y cos \u03b81)], 0 \u2264 \u03b81 \u2264 pi\/2,(77)\nand write \u03c61 = \u03c6\n(inc)\n1 + \u03c6\n(ref)\n1 , then we require that \u03c6\n(ref)\n1 is outgoing in y > 0 and a\nradiation or extinction condition must also be applied to \u03c62 in y < 0. It is the latter\ncondition that gives rise to complex rays in this problem, because, incorporating all\nthe conditions at infinity, the solution turns out to be\n\u03c6\n(ref)\n1 (x, y) =\nn cos \u03b81 \u2212 \u03bb cos \u03b82\nn cos \u03b81 + \u03bb cos \u03b82\nexp[ik1(x sin \u03b81 + y cos \u03b81)], y > 0,(78)\n\u03c62(x, y) =\n2n cos \u03b81\nn cos \u03b81 + \u03bb cos \u03b82\nexp[ik2(x sin \u03b82 \u2212 y cos \u03b82)], y < 0,(79)\nwhere n = k1\/k2 and k1 sin \u03b81 = k2 sin \u03b82, all assuming k2 > k1. However, if k2 < k1,\nthere is the possibility that sin \u03b82 = (k1\/k2) sin \u03b81 exceeds unity, giving rise to a\ncomplex angle of transmission \u03b82. In this case we must choose the sign of the y-\ndependence in the exponent in (79) in order to guarantee decay as y \u2192 \u2212\u221e. From a\nray perspective, eikonal data for \u03c6(ref)1 and \u03c62 are\np\n(ref)\n1 (s, 0) = sin \u03b81, q\n(ref)\n1 (s, 0) = cos \u03b81(80)\nand\np2(s, 0) =\nk1\nk2\nsin \u03b81, q2(s, 0) =\n(\n1\u2212 k\n2\n1\nk22\nsin2 \u03b81\n)1\/2\n,(81)\nwhere the sign in q(ref)1 is chosen to satisfy the radiation condition in y > 0, but the\nbranch for q2 in (81) has yet to be specified. The ray equations in y < 0 are\nx =\nk1\nk2\nsin \u03b81t+ s,(82)\ny =\n(\n1\u2212 k\n2\n1\nk22\nsin2 \u03b81\n)1\/2\nt,(83)\nu2 =\nk1\nk2\nsin \u03b81s+ t,(84)\nfrom which we can see that if k2 < k1, then we must define(\n1\u2212 k\n2\n1\nk22\nsin2 \u03b81\n)1\/2\n= \u2212i\n(\nk21\nk22\nsin2 \u03b81 \u2212 1\n)1\/2\nin order to get decay as y \u2192 \u2212\u221e. Thus, the expression\ns = x\u2212 ik1 sin \u03b81 y\u221a\nk21 sin\n2 \u03b81 \u2212 k22\n(85)\nlinks any observation point P in y < 0 to the complex point of emergence s on the\nboundary of the transmitted ray through P (as in Figure 4).\nWhat is happening is that real initiation points on the boundary (s \u2208 R) produce\ntransmitted rays that immediately leave the physical domain. It is only those rays\ntransmitted from that portion of the complexified boundary defined by (85) for (x, y) \u2208\nR2, y < 0, which provide the refracted field.\n430 CHAPMAN, LAWRY, OCKENDON, AND TEW\nFig. 4 Three-dimensional cross section of complex (x, y) space defined by Im y = 0. Here x =\nx1 + ix2, y = y1, where x1, x2, y1 \u2208 R. The diagram shows a ray leaving the complexified\nboundary (the (x1, x2) plane) and intersecting real space (the (x1, y1) plane) in a point.\nIn the harder example where the configuration is forced by a remote, time-\nharmonic line source in the upper medium, the incoming field can be decomposed\ninto a family of rays all emanating from the source point. As these rays impinge upon\nthe boundary, they behave on a local scale like an incoming plane wave, and all the\nprevious arguments apply. That is, if k1 > k2, then those incident rays for which the\nangle of incidence \u03b8 satisfies (k1\/k2) sin \u03b8 < 1 will reflect and transmit in the usual\nfashion. However, for those such that (k1\/k2) sin \u03b8 > 1, the locally refracted rays in-\nstantly leave the physical domain, never to reappear. The associated transmitted field\nis then generated by a complex ray refracted from other points on the complexified\nboundary, as determined by the prescription outlined earlier. Some very interesting\nfeatures of the evanescent transmitted field that occurs in this case will be discussed\nin section 6.2. Apart from illustrating the fact that complex-ray contributions can\nand do arise in apparently \u201creal ray\u201d scenarios, this second example also shows the\nneed to examine all rays, real and complex, emitted from any source, since rays of\nthe latter type might induce further complex rays at points of reflection or diffraction\nthat then go on to have physical significance.\nGaussian Beams. We define a Gaussian beam to be a collimated wavefield propa-\ngating in a specified direction with an amplitude that decreases algebraically along\nthe direction of propagation and exponentially in a transverse direction with a decay\nexponent that is quadratic in the cross-profile coordinate. There is no such explicit\nexact solution to the Helmholtz equation2 but it can be associated with an asymptotic\nrepresentation of an exact solution valid in the so-called paraxial region close to the\ncentral axis of the beam [11]. The basic notion is to take Green\u2019s function for the\ntwo-dimensional Helmholtz equation, H(1)0 (kr), where r =\n\u221a\nx2 + y2, and to shift the\norigin to a suitably defined complex location.\nSuppose the source is located at the point (x0, y0) with\nx0 = (b1 \u2212 ib2) sin\u03b1, y0 = \u2212(b1 \u2212 ib2) cos\u03b1,(86)\n2Indeed, there is no systematic theory concerning the circumstances in which a source (say, a\nwave emitted from the end of a waveguide) can set up a Gaussian beam.\nON THE THEORY OF COMPLEX RAYS 431\nwhere b1, b2 > 0 and \u03b1 are given real parameters. Identifying\nx1 = x cos\u03b1+ y sin\u03b1,(87)\ny1 = \u2212x sin\u03b1+ y cos\u03b1+ b1(88)\nallows the complex radial distance r =\n\u221a\n(x\u2212 x0)2 + (y \u2212 y0)2 to be written in the\nform\nr =\n\u221a\nx21 + (y1 \u2212 ib2)2.(89)\nThe paraxial region is now defined by\nx21 \u001c y21 + b22,(90)\nand if this condition is satisfied, then\nr \u223c y1 \u2212 ib2 + x\n2\n1\n2(y1 \u2212 ib2) .(91)\nIf, in addition to (90), we impose the far-field condition ky1 \u001d 1, then the modulus of\nthe complex-valued argument of the Hankel function H(1)0 (kr) is uniformly large, and\nthe Hankel function may be replaced by the first term in its asymptotic expansion, i.e.,\nby ieikr\/(4\n\u221a\nkr). Incorporating (91) into this expression then yields an asymptotic\nfield proportional to\nekb2\u221a\ny1 \u2212 ib2\n\u221a\nk\nexp\n[\niky1 +\nikx21\n2(y1 \u2212 ib2)\n]\n,\nwhich has precisely the qualities required of a Gaussian beam. Thus, the y1-axis is\nthe principal axis of propagation and x1 is the cross-profile coordinate. Geometrically,\n\u03b1 is the angle of incidence of the beam, measured from the normal, with respect to\nthe boundary y = 0; b1 is the distance of the \u201cwaist\u201d of the beam from the origin\nx = 0, y = 0; and\n\u221a\nb2\/k is the thickness of the beam at its waist (see Figure 5). The\nlines in Figure 5 represent the level curves of Imu and thus indicate lines of constant\nmagnitude of the wavefield. These are also the normals to the level curves of Reu\nand can be shown to be the direction of energy flow to leading order.\nThus we see that as far as its specification in the physical domain is concerned,\nthe beam essentially has four parameters: (a) angle of incidence, (b) width of beam,\n(c) distance of waist from the origin, and (d) specification that the beam pass through\nthe origin. An alternative specification would be to replace the two conditions (c) and\n(d) by the coordinates of the \u201ccenter\u201d of the beam, this being defined as the midpoint\nof the waistline. These four degrees of freedom are just the four degrees of freedom\navailable to us in specifying the complex source coordinates x0 and y0.\nIn later parts of this paper, we shall discuss in detail some problems involving\nthe diffraction of Gaussian beams under a variety of circumstances, but here it is\nimportant to understand the ray structure of a Gaussian beam according to this\nprescription. The beam is generated by a uniform source emitting an isotropic family\nof complex rays from the complex source point defined by (86). The parameter that\nvaries from one ray to the next is the polar angle, \u03b8, measured with respect to this\nsource point as origin. Thus, the equation of the rays can be written as \u03b8 = constant,\nwhere\ny \u2212 y0\nx\u2212 x0 = tan \u03b8.\n432 CHAPMAN, LAWRY, OCKENDON, AND TEW\nFig. 5 Diagram of a Gaussian beam.\nIf we now write tan \u03b8 = t1 + it2, t1, t2 \u2208 R; substitute for x0 and y0 from (86); and\nrestrict our attention to real values of x and y, then separating real and imaginary\nparts yields\ny + b1 cos\u03b1 = t1(x\u2212 b1 sin\u03b1)\u2212 b2t2 sin\u03b1,(92)\n\u2212b2 cos\u03b1 = t1b2 sin\u03b1+ t2(x\u2212 b1 sin\u03b1).(93)\nThese equations therefore allow t1 and t2 (and hence \u03b8) to be calculated for a specified\nreal observation point, showing that such a value of \u03b8 is generally complex. Generally,\nthere is a one-to-one correspondence between (x, y) and (t1, t2), showing that the\ncomplex rays emitted from the source intersect the physical domain in points, at\nwhich the eikonal and transport equations can be solved to give the local field. The\nsuperposition of all these point contributions then forms the Gaussian profile. The\nexception that arises is when t2 = 0, so that \u03b8 is real (but note that \u03b8 is still measured\nwith respect to a complex origin). In this case, t1 = \u2212 cot\u03b1 and y = \u2212x cot\u03b1. Thus\nit is for this value of \u03b8, and only for this value of \u03b8, that the associated complex ray\nintersects the physical domain along a straight line, and this line is coincident with\nthe central axis of the beam.\nThe discussion above indicates the need for a careful geometric characterization\nof complex rays, which we give in the next section.\n3. The Geometry of Complex Rays. We found in the previous section that\neven in very simple two-dimensional ray problems, there may be real values of x and\nON THE THEORY OF COMPLEX RAYS 433\ny that correspond to complex values of s and t. The idea behind complex-ray theory\nis to consider all complex values of s, t, x, and y from the beginning and then, by\nconsidering all ray intersections with real space, to enumerate all the relevant complex-\nray contributions to the solution of the physical problem. We choose the following\ndefinition.\nDefinition. A complex ray is the set of complex points (x, y) corresponding\nto fixing a complex value of s in the ray equations (given by (8)\u2013(12) in the two-\ndimensional case, with x0, y0, and u0 necessarily analytic functions3) and then allow-\ning the distance parameter t to range over all complex values, with t = 0 coinciding\nwith the initiation point on the boundary.\nWhatever the dimensionality of the ray problem in physical space, the equations\nof the rays can be written in the vector form\nx = p0(s)t+ x0(s),(94)\nwhere p0(s) = \u2207u and x0(s) is a parametrization of the boundary. Thus, fixing s \u2208 C\nprescribes the initiation point x0(s) of the ray and its \u201cdirection of propagation\u201d\np0(s), both of these quantities generally being complex. The dimensionality of the\nray is therefore the number of degrees of freedom in t. Hence, a complex ray is\nalways a two-dimensional manifold that exists in either the four-dimensional space of\ncomplex x and y or the six-dimensional space of complex x, y, and z, depending upon\nthe nature of the underlying problem. In the case of constant refractive index that\nwe consider here this manifold is flat.\nWhether or not a given complex ray intersects the physical domain can now be\nexpressed geometrically in terms of the intersection (or not, as the case may be) of\na two-dimensional plane (the complex ray) with either a two-dimensional plane (i.e.,\nR2) if the physical problem is two-dimensional or with a three-dimensional plane if\nthe physical problem is three-dimensional. The ray is likely to intersect the physical\ndomain in the former case but less likely in the latter, since there is an extra dimension\nin which the complex ray can be lost. In either case, if a complex ray does penetrate\nreal space, the generic intersection is in a point. The real rays of geometrical optics\nand GTD correspond to the degenerate case in which this intersection is a line.\nOne final general comment is that our definition implies that for given ray data\naway from points of diffraction, the ray leaving a point on the boundary is unique. For\na given point on the ray, there is an infinity of one-dimensional curves lying within\nthe ray linking that point to the initiation site on the boundary. Each such curve\nsatisfies the ray equations in its own right because it is embedded within a higher-\ndimensional surface (which is the union of these curves) which does. We choose the\nlatter two-dimensional surface for our definition of a complex ray, in agreement with\n[14, 13], whereas some authors (as in [26]) define the former one-dimensional curves\nas complex rays.\nAs a typical example of complex-ray tracing, we can return to the problem of the\ncircular caustic and ask where the rays intersecting x2+y2 < 1 meet the caustic. These\nrays will be tangent at complex points on the caustic, as we can see by considering\nthe three-dimensional cross section Im(y) = 0 of four-dimensional space. Then the\ncaustic x2 + y2 = 1 consists of the circle x2 = 0, x21 + y\n2\n1 = 1 and the hyperbola\nx1 = 0, y21 \u2212 x22 = 1, where x = x1 + ix2, y = y1 + iy2, with x1, x2, y1, y2 real (see\nFigure 6). Rays tangent to the circle are the real rays of section 2.2. Rays tangent to\nthe hyperbola intersect real space in a point within x2 + y2 < 1.\n3We will consider the case of nonanalytic x0 and y0 in section 7.\n434 CHAPMAN, LAWRY, OCKENDON, AND TEW\nFig. 6 Three-dimensional cross section of (x, y) space defined by Im y = 0. The diagram shows rays\ntangent to complex points on the circular caustic x2 + y2 = 1 intersecting real space in the\nregion (Rex)2 + (Re y)2 < 1.\nFig. 7 Diagram of the boundary of a scatterer dividing a ray into reflected and throughgoing com-\nponents.\nLet us now make some further dimensional observations, based on two-dimensional\nphysical problems, and raise some questions.\n(i) The intersection between a propagating complex ray and a complexified bound-\nary will also be a point in general. Thus the intersection of an incident complex ray\nwith the boundary does not split the ray into two halves, as is the case with real rays,\nwhere the boundary divides the incident real ray into incoming and \u201cthroughgoing\u201d\nparts (see Figure 7). The presence of the boundary means that the throughgoing ray\nON THE THEORY OF COMPLEX RAYS 435\nFig. 8 Diagram of a tangency point determining the lit portion of a scatterer and the tangent ray\nforming the shadow boundary.\nis discarded. Such rules are not available for complex rays. Put another way, since the\ncomplexified boundary itself is a two-dimensional manifold in four-dimensional space,\nit has no inside or outside. In real-ray problems the boundary is one-dimensional in\ntwo-dimensional space, and we solve on the outside of the boundary only. Indeed,\nanalytically continuing this solution to the inside will generically lead to singularities\nin the solution since it involves solving the Cauchy problem inside a closed curve. In\ncomplex space we cannot separate the inside from the outside.\n(ii) Following from observation (i), a real ray at two-point grazing incidence to\na smooth boundary will divide the boundary into lit and unlit regions, as shown\nin Figure 8. However, because the intersection of a complex grazing ray with the\ncomplexified boundary is a point, and the complexified boundary is a two-dimensional\nmanifold, the intersection cannot divide the complexified boundary into lit and unlit\nregions. How, then, are we to determine the lit portion of the complexified boundary?\nMoreover, for real rays, a ray at two-point grazing incidence forms the boundary\nof the shadow region; on one side of it the incident and reflected rays are present; on\nthe other side of it they are not (see Figure 8). In complex space, however, the tangent\nray is only two-dimensional and therefore cannot bound a region of four-dimensional\nspace, so that it cannot be the boundary of the shadow region in complex space.\n(iii) A complex caustic of the wavefield is a two-dimensional manifold, and there-\nfore every ray meets the caustic in a point. Hence the caustic, like the complexified\nboundary, does not divide the ray into incoming and outgoing halves.\n(iv) Finally, since the complex caustic is a two-dimensional manifold in four-\ndimensional space, it too cannot have an inside and an outside as a real caustic does.\nWhat, then, do we mean by the dark side of a caustic?\nThus we see that once complex rays are being considered, much of the intuition\nwe have built up using real rays is lost. However, the observations and questions\nabove also illustrate some of the advantages of complex rays. Let us first consider the\nimplications of observation (iv).\nConsider again the circular caustic at x2 + y2 = 1. Let us work for the moment\nin the y = 0 plane, so that the caustic lies at x = \u00b11. Then, if we are restricted to\nreal space, we cannot get from the outside of the caustic (|x| > 1) to the inside of the\ncaustic (|x| < 1) without passing through the caustic, and it is this that necessitated\nthe matched asymptotic analysis of section 2.2. However, if complex values of x are\nallowed, we can analytically continue the solution from the bright side around to\nthe dark side without going near the singularities at x = \u00b11. Let us start with the\n436 CHAPMAN, LAWRY, OCKENDON, AND TEW\nFig. 9 Diagram indicating the analytic continuation of the incoming ray solution around the caustic\nx2 + y2 = 1 in the plane x = x1 + ix2, y = 0, where x1, x2 \u2208 R.\nincoming ray field\nu = \u03b8 + cos\u22121(1\/r)\u2212\n\u221a\nr2 \u2212 1\n= cos\u22121(1\/x)\u2212\n\u221a\nx2 \u2212 1,(95)\nA0 =\n1\n(r2 \u2212 1)1\/4 =\n1\n(x2 \u2212 1)1\/4(96)\nat A in Figure 9 and analytically continue anticlockwise around the caustic at x = 1.\nThen, on reaching real space on the inside of the caustic at B, u is positive imaginary\nand \u03c6 is exponentially small. Allowing complex rays means that we can compute the\nsolution in the interior of the caustic. Note that although the analysis of section 2.2\ngave us the solution in the vicinity of the caustic, it did not give us an approximation\nto \u03c6 away from the caustic on the dark side. Here our analytic continuation gives us\na recipe for this exponentially small field.\nProceeding with the analytic continuation, we arrive back on the bright side at C.\nHere we are on the other branch of the square root in u, so we arrive at the outgoing ray\nu = \u2212 cos\u22121(1\/x)+\u221ax2 \u2212 1. The amplitude A0 has changed by a factor e\u2212ipi\/2. Hence\nwe have retrieved the outgoing wavefield complete with the correct phase change, and\nwe have not had to consider the inner expansion near the singularity at x = 1 at all.\nThis is an example of the Keller\u2013Maslov theory of semiclassical mechanics [22]. In\nthat theory it is also crucial to consider the phase function u as living on a Riemann\nsurface in which the caustics are the branch points.\nOur analytic continuation procedure has anticipated inherent dangers, as we can\nsee if we proceed further with the analytic continuation to arrive again on the inside\nof the caustic, because this time the branch of the square root will correspond to the\nexponentially large solution D. Clearly, we need some rule to tell us when to stop\nanalytically continuing. Not all complex rays should be included in the solution at all\npoints in space if we are to identify physically acceptable solutions.\nThis fact becomes even more obvious when we consider simple reflection problems,\nfor example, the reflection of a plane wave by a cylinder (see Figure 10). If we\nanalytically continue the incident and reflected wavefields and consider all complex\nvalues of s and t, we immediately end up with the wavefields shown in Figure 11, in\nON THE THEORY OF COMPLEX RAYS 437\nFig. 10 Incident and reflected rays when a plane wave is scattered by a circular cylinder.\nFig. 11 Rays obtained on analytically continuing the rays in Figure 10.\nwhich the incident field proceeds all the way through the cylinder to the shadow region\nand we have \u201creflected\u201d rays coming in from infinity. These rays had previously been\nruled out by the selection procedures for real rays and the laws of causality. However,\nas observed in (i)\u2013(iv), these procedures cannot be applied to complex rays.\nIn fact, the whole idea of causality itself is lost when considering complex rays.\nSince real rays correspond to t \u2208 R, there is a natural ordering of the points on the ray,\nwhich gives the ray a direction; in this way we can distinguish incoming and outgoing\n438 CHAPMAN, LAWRY, OCKENDON, AND TEW\nrays. Although it is possible to regard a complex ray as the union of one-dimensional\nmanifolds on which Re t provides an ordering parameter [43], it is not clear that\nsuch a definition would necessarily lead to unique, physically relevant solutions of the\nHelmholtz equation. Thus, since we can no longer distinguish between incoming and\noutgoing rays and appeal to causality, we need a new set of rules for determining\nwhich complex rays are \u201cactive\u201d (i.e., contribute to a physically meaningful rayfield)\nat any point in space.\n4. Stokes\u2019 Phenomenon and Complex Rays. Our discussion thus far has led\nto the basic question of the relationship between the process of analytic continuation\nand WKB asymptotic expansions. Hence it has provided the motivation for asking\nhow Stokes\u2019 phenomenon is involved in complex-ray theory. To answer this question,\nthree attributes of Stokes\u2019 phenomenon must be borne in mind, and we begin by\nlisting them.\n4.1. Stokes\u2019 Phenomenon. Let us first briefly review the role of Stokes\u2019 phe-\nnomenon in the WKB approximation of ordinary differential equations [33, 36]. Con-\nsider, for example, the ordinary differential equation\nd2w\ndz2\n+ 2z\ndw\ndz\n= 0.(97)\nApplying a WKB ansatz for large |z| leads to the \u201cray\u201d solutions w(z) \u223c constant\nand f(z) \u223c e\u2212z2\/z. Suppose we take the ray solution w(z) \u223c e\u2212z2\/(\u221apiz) for large\npositive z and attempt to analytically continue by sweeping z around anticlockwise\nin a large circular arc in the complex plane, as in Figure 9. Then there is nothing to\nindicate the breakdown of the WKB ansatz, and we would arrive on the negative z-\naxis with the same ray. However, we know that the solution to (97) with the behavior\nw(z) \u223c e\u2212z2\/(\u221apiz) as z \u2192\u221e is w(z) = erfc(z) and that erfc(z) \u223c 2 + e\u2212z2\/(\u221apiz) as\nz \u2192 \u2212\u221e. Thus there is a multiple of the second ray present. This ray is \u201cswitched on\u201d\nat the Stokes line arg z = pi\/2 and is switched off again at the Stokes line arg z = 3pi\/2.\nSuch switching appears at first sight to be a jump in the amplitude of the ray in the\nWKB approximation but is in fact a smooth but rapid transition as was found in\n[4], made rigorous in [32], and formulated in the language of matched asymptotic\nexpansions in [34]. The Stokes lines are characterized as lines along which w1(z) =\ne\u2212z\n2\n\/(\n\u221a\npiz) is maximally dominant over w2(z) = 2 (this being the specific value of\nthe constant here) or, equivalently,\nthe phases of w1 and w2 are equal;(98)\nthat is, Im(\u2212z2) = Im(0). Thus the \u201cray\u201d picture of the solution erfc(z) is as shown\nin Figure 12. The ray e\u2212z\n2\n\/(\n\u221a\npiz) is always present, but the ray 2 only contributes\nin the left half-plane. In Figure 12 we have also indicated the anti-Stokes lines, which\nwe define as the lines on which the amplitudes of w1 and w2 are equal, that is, on\nwhich Re(\u2212z2) = Re(0).\n4.2. Stokes\u2019 Phenomenon as SaddlesCross SteepestDescent Paths.

The extra ray contribution 2 arises from this integration.\nThis change in geometry of the steepest descent path is typical of Stokes\u2019 phe-\nnomenon. Here it occurs because the steepest descent path from z goes through the\nsaddle at v = 0 when Re z = 0.\nSince the contribution from a saddle point is \u201cswitched on\u201d when the steepest\ndescent path crosses it, we see why the Stokes lines should correspond to lines of\nequal phase of two rays, since at the point where the extra saddle is picked up both\ncontributing points (in this case, saddle and end-point) lie on the same steepest de-\nscent (and therefore constant-phase) path. Of course, not all equal-phase lines will be\nStokes lines, as is the case for arg z = 0 and pi in Figure 12. Everything will depend\n440 CHAPMAN, LAWRY, OCKENDON, AND TEW\nFig. 14 Schematic diagram showing the Stokes lines governing the contributions of the poles to the\nasymptotic behavior of the integral (100).\nupon the geometry of the saddle points and steepest descent contours. In general, the\nequal-phase lines will be easy to calculate, but the ability to discern the saddle point\ngeometry depends on the availability of a sufficiently simple integral representation of\nthe solution. Thus we will see that one of our main difficulties will be deciding which\nof the equal-phase lines are Stokes lines.\nExactly the same scenario emerges for contour integrals involving singular inte-\ngrands or with finite limits of integration. For example, the integral\u222b pi\n0\neizt dt\n1 + t2\n(100)\nstudied in [35] has possible asymptotic contributions from t = 0, pi,\u00b1i as |z| \u2192 \u221e.\nHere the contributions from the poles t = \u00b1i are switched on when the real parts of\nthe phases of the end-point contributions e0, eipiz are equal to those of the residues at\nthe poles, \u2213(i\/2)e\u2213z. Hence the z-plane is as in Figure 14.\nWe will henceforth define Stokes lines as lines across which a switching of the\ntype described above actually occurs. The condition (98) necessarily holds on Stokes\nlines, but it is not sufficient to define them. However, this condition applies when\nintegral representations may be unavailable; moreover, both (98) and the steepest\ndescent characterizations apply to linear partial differential equations and functions\nof several complex variables, in which case we will say the switching occurs across\nStokes surfaces.\nThere is another characterization of Stokes lines that does not demand prior\nrepresentation of the solution in terms of an integral (such as a Fourier integral); we\nwill discuss this in the next section.\n4.3. Stokes\u2019 Phenomenon via Optimal Truncation. The information about the\n\u201cswitching on\u201d of a subdominant ray across a Stokes line is contained in the tail of\nON THE THEORY OF COMPLEX RAYS 441\nthe asymptotic expansion of the dominant ray [4, 34, 10]. We briefly review this\ndiscussion here.\nLet us again use as an example the complementary error function,\nerfc(z) =\n2\u221a\npi\n\u222b \u221e\nz\ne\u2212v\n2\ndv,\nwhich has the asymptotic expansion\nerfc(z) \u223c e\n\u2212z2\nz\n\u221a\npi\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\n(\u22121)n(2n)!\nn!(4z2)n\n, | arg z| < 3pi\/4,(101)\nerfc(z) \u223c 2 + e\n\u2212z2\nz\n\u221a\npi\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\n(\u22121)n(2n)!\nn!(4z2)n\n, | arg(\u2212z)| < 3pi\/4,(102)\nas |z| \u2192 \u221e. Now consider the expansion (101) in the sector 0 < arg z < pi. We\ntruncate after N terms to give\nerfc(z) =\ne\u2212z\n2\nz\n\u221a\npi\nN\u2211\nn=0\n(\u22121)n(2n)!\nn!(4z2)n\n+RN (z),(103)\nfrom which it follows that the remainder RN (z) is a solution of the inhomogeneous\nordinary differential equation\nd2RN\ndz2\n+ 2z\ndRN\ndz\n=\ne\u2212z\n2\nz\n\u221a\npi\n(\u22121)N (2N)!\n(N \u2212 1)!4N\u22121z2N .(104)\nTo examine the behavior of RN as arg z varies, we introduce polar coordinates by\nwriting\nz = rei\u03b8, 0 < \u03b8 < pi,\nd\ndz\n= \u2212 ie\n\u2212i\u03b8\nr\nd\nd\u03b8\n,\nd2\ndz2\n= \u2212 ie\n\u22122i\u03b8\nr2\nd\nd\u03b8\n\u2212 e\n\u22122i\u03b8\nr2\nd2\nd\u03b82\n.\nThen substitution into (104) gives\n\u2212e\n\u22122i\u03b8\nr2\nd2RN\nd\u03b82\n+i\n(\ne\u22122i\u03b8\nr2\n\u2212 2\n)\ndRN\nd\u03b8\n=\nexp\n[\u2212r2e2i\u03b8 +Npii\u2212 (2N + 1)i\u03b8] (2N)!\u221a\npi(N \u2212 1)!4N\u22121r2N+1 .\n(105)\nNow suppose that we wish to truncate the expansion (101) for erfc(z) optimally ; that\nis, we require the value of N for which RN and hence the right-hand side of (105)\nare minimal. We find that this happens when N \u223c r2. We therefore set N = r2 + a,\nwhere a is bounded as r \u2192 \u221e. Then, as r \u2192 \u221e, the right-hand side of (105) is\napproximately\n8r\u221a\n2pi\nexp\n[\u2212ia(2\u03b8 \u2212 pi)\u2212 i\u03b8 \u2212 r2(e2i\u03b8 + 1 + i(2\u03b8 \u2212 pi))] .(106)\nFollowing [34] we finally ask for which values of \u03b8 the optimal remainder RN changes\nmost rapidly, and we note that (106) is maximal as a function of \u03b8 at the Stokes\nline \u03b8 = pi\/2. At this point it also ceases to be oscillatory and is independent of a.\nIntroducing local coordinates near the Stokes line by setting\nr = \u03c1\/\u000f, \u03b8 = pi\/2 + \u03b4\u03c8,\n442 CHAPMAN, LAWRY, OCKENDON, AND TEW\nwe find\ne\u22122i\u03b4\u03c8\u000f2\n\u03c12\u03b42\nd2RN\nd\u03c82\n\u2212 i\n(\ne\u22122i\u03b4\u03c8\u000f2\n\u03c12\u03b4\n+\n2\n\u03b4\n)\ndRN\nd\u03c8\n\u223c \u2212 8\u03c1i\n\u000f\n\u221a\n2pi\ne\u22122\u03c1\n2\u03c82\u03b42\/\u000f2 .(107)\nWe find a sensible balance of terms when \u03b4 = \u000f giving, to leading order,\ndRN\nd\u03c8\n\u223c 4\u03c1\u221a\n2pi\ne\u22122\u03c1\n2\u03c82 ,(108)\nwith solution\nRN \u223c B + erf(\n\u221a\n2\u03c1\u03c8).(109)\nMatching (109) to the optimally truncated outer solution (101) as \u03c8 \u2192 \u2212\u221e shows\nthat the remainder is exponentially small, giving B = 1. As \u03c8 \u2192\u221e we therefore find\nthat RN \u2192 2. Thus we can see in more detail the switching-on of the subdominant\nray across the Stokes line.\nWe have now identified a further characterization of the Stokes line \u03b8 = pi\/2. In\nparticular, the right-hand side of (105) is maximal, nonoscillatory, and independent\nof a. These properties all follow from the fact that successive terms in the asymptotic\nexpansion of erfc(z) have the same phase along the Stokes line [12]. This suggests\nthe third characterization in addition to those mentioned in section 4.2, and this\nthird characterization also applies at once to functions of several complex variables;\nit is that surfaces on which the asymptotic expansion (1) of a general wavefield \u03c6 is\ndivergent and satisfies\nlim\nn\u2192\u221e arg\niAn\nAn\u22121\n= 0(110)\nwill be Stokes surfaces. This prescription gives us the possibility of proceeding ab\ninitio from a WKB expansion of any particular wavefield and determining where\nother wavefields can be switched on and off. Thus it will prove extremely valuable in\nsome of our later calculations.\nWe note that not all the Stokes lines or surfaces will be picked up this way. An\nexample in [34] shows that the information about some Stokes lines may be buried\ndeep in the expansion of An as n\u2192\u221e. Consider, for example, the function erfc(z) +\ne\u2212z\n4\nerfc(iz). Information about the Stokes line of the second function on the positive\nreal axis is swamped by the expansion of the first function there. Hence (110) will\nnot select all the Stokes lines for such functions. However, when a sufficiently simple\nintegral representation is not available, (110) can give extra information above (98)\nto help decide which of the equal-phase surfaces are Stokes surfaces.\nIn summary, we have two characterizations, (98) and (110), of Stokes\u2019 phe-\nnomenon, neither of which is complete, but which do not require an explicit rep-\nresentation of the solution in terms of an integral, and which can be used to identify\nStokes surfaces as three-dimensional manifolds for ray theory in two real space dimen-\nsions. This will shortly enable us to reexamine our simplest motivational example,\nthe circular caustic, with the aim of elucidating its asymptotic structure without prior\nknowledge of the formula (53). We will be especially interested in gaining ab initio\ninformation (i.e., just from (50)\u2013(52)) about the position of the equal-phase surfaces\nand, more importantly, which of these equal-phase surfaces are Stokes surfaces (i.e.,\nwhich actually switch on a subdominant rayfield). Hence, in section 4.4, we will see\nhow the complex rays are divided into active and inactive components by Stokes lines.\nON THE THEORY OF COMPLEX RAYS 443\nFig. 15 Diagram indicating the ray contributions in the WKB expansion of Ai(\u221221\/3\u03c1); d and s\nindicate the dominant and subdominant rays, respectively, while S and AS indicate the\nStokes and anti-Stokes lines.\nThis will intimately involve the Riemann surface of the multivalued phase function,\nwhich is singular on the two-dimensional caustic manifold x2 + y2 = 1; of particular\ninterest will be the way in which the boundaries of the Riemann surface relate to the\nStokes surface.\n4.4. The Circular Caustic Revisited.\n(a) Inner region. In section 2.2 we derived the Airy equation\nd2f\nd\u03c12\n+ 2\u03c1f = 0(111)\nfor the local field amplitude in the vicinity of the caustic. The conditions that we\nimposed on the solution to this equation were that in the interior of the caustic f is\nto be exponentially small (rather than large), while in the exterior two propagating\nrays must be present. Of these, precisely one should match the prescribed incoming\nrayfield, and the other is then consequently the outgoing rayfield. These conditions\nare enough to specify f(\u03c1) uniquely, and it is proportional to Ai(\u221221\/3\u03c1).\nAs a function of the complex variable \u03c1 = \u03c11+i\u03c12, \u03c11, \u03c12 \u2208 R, the Stokes structure\nof this solution is well known (see, e.g., [35]) and is depicted in Figure 15. The equal-\nphase lines are situated at arg \u03c1 = pi\/3, pi, 5pi\/3, whereas the anti-Stokes lines, along\nwhich the two asymptotic contributions are comparable, lie along arg \u03c1 = 0, 2pi\/3,\n4pi\/3. Thus, outside the caustic in physical space (\u03c12 = 0, \u03c11 \u2192 \u221e) there are two\nrays of equal importance, and in the interior (\u03c12 = 0, \u03c11 \u2192 \u2212\u221e) there is only one,\nexponentially small, contribution.\nWe emphasize that Stokes lines are associated with particular solutions of holo-\nmorphic differential equations, rather than the differential equations themselves. Of\ncourse, the existence of Figure 15 is a consequence of prior knowledge of the solution\nof (111), say, in [35]. For our purposes, it is important to ask whether it would be\npossible to deduce this information armed only with the governing equation (111), the\nmatching conditions, and our knowledge of Stokes lines as discussed in section 4.3.\n444 CHAPMAN, LAWRY, OCKENDON, AND TEW\nAfter all, a more general problem may not be as amenable as (111) to an exact analy-\nsis, and even if it were, the solution might be so unwieldy as to make the construction\nof the Stokes line structure intractable. To show that in this case it is possible to\ndeduce the Stokes line structure easily, we note that a WKB approximation to (111)\nas |\u03c1| \u2192 \u221e provides the two ray solutions\nf\u2212(\u03c1) \u223c e\n\u22122\u221a2i\u03c13\/2\/3\n\u03c11\/4\n, f+(\u03c1) \u223c e\n2\n\u221a\n2i\u03c13\/2\/3\n\u03c11\/4\n.\nOur \u201cequal phases\u201d argument (98) immediately limits the Stokes lines to arg \u03c1 = pi\/3,\npi, 5pi\/3 and all that remains is to decide which of these are actually Stokes lines.\nWe know that we need two contributing rays on \u03c12 = 0, \u03c11 \u2192 \u221e and one (small)\nray contribution on \u03c12 = 0, \u03c11 \u2192 \u2212\u221e. Hence the equal-phase lines arg \u03c1 = pi\/3 and\narg \u03c1 = 5pi\/3 must both be Stokes lines, and each must switch off one of the rays, since\notherwise two rays and not just one would survive to reach \u03c12 = 0, \u03c11 \u2192 \u2212\u221e. Thus,\nregardless of the direction in which we approach this half-axis, there can be only one\nray contributing in its vicinity, and so this equal-phase line cannot be a Stokes line.\nOf course, for other solutions of Airy\u2019s equation the equal-phase line arg(\u03c1) = pi will\nbe a Stokes line, and we shall see such an example in section 5.\nWe note that since we have suppressed the coordinate \u03b8 in our inner analysis, the\nStokes lines we have identified are really three-dimensional hypersurfaces in complex\n(x, y) space, and we will refer to them as Stokes surfaces henceforth.\nThis example suggests the following procedure: determine the possible contribut-\ning complex rayfields, determine the equal-phase surfaces associated with them taken\nin appropriate pairs, and then decide which of these are Stokes surfaces. This should\nthen provide a systematic recipe for finding \u201cregions of existence\u201d of complex rays as\nwell as, most important, the implications that this has for the physical solution. The\nmost difficult part of this procedure in general will be deciding which of the equal-\nphase surfaces are \u201cactive\u201d Stokes surfaces. In some cases, as in the present example,\nthis can be seen immediately from inspection. However, in other cases the Stokes\nsurfaces are not immediately obvious, and we may need to call on the other charac-\nterization of Stokes surfaces that we have identified earlier in this section, namely,\n(110).\n(b) Outer region. Well away from the caustic, the ray solution (50)\u2013(52) is valid.\nThe Stokes surfaces emanating from the caustic can be continued into the outer region\nusing the first of our characterizations, namely, as surfaces of equal phase (as noted\nby [16] for the case of a circular caustic of complex radius). From (56) the equation\nfor the equal-phase surfaces is\nRe\n[\ncos\u22121(1\/r)\u2212\n\u221a\nr2 \u2212 1\n]\n= 0.(112)\nThese surfaces are therefore no longer flat, and whether or not the surfaces represented\nby (112) are Stokes surfaces is determined by matching with those in Figure 15 as the\ncaustic is approached. Two different cross sections are shown in Figures 16 and 17.\nConsider the first of these, which is a planar cross section for y = 1\/2. This intersects\nthe caustic at the real points (\u00b1\u221a3\/2, 1\/2), each of which therefore exhibits behavior\nas in Figure 15 in its vicinity. To understand the implications of Figure 16, restrict\nattention to the local structure near (\u2212\u221a3\/2, 1\/2). We know that in x2 = 0, x1 >\n\u2212\u221a3\/2 (i.e., inside the caustic), there is one complex ray yielding an exponentially\nsmall solution. This, of course, is guaranteed for us by the Stokes structure of the\ninner Airy solution. As we sweep counterclockwise around this inner region we meet\nON THE THEORY OF COMPLEX RAYS 445\nFig. 16 Diagram showing the Stokes surfaces for the circular caustic in the plane x = x1 + ix2,\ny = 0.5, with x1, x2 \u2208 R. The dotted line indicates the cut in the lower sheet of the\nRiemann surface.\nFig. 17 Diagram showing the Stokes surfaces for the circular caustic in the plane x = x1 + ix2,\ny = 2, with x1, x2 \u2208 R. The dotted line indicates the cut in the lower sheet of the Riemann\nsurface.\n446 CHAPMAN, LAWRY, OCKENDON, AND TEW\nthe first solution of (112), which is a Stokes surface extending to infinity in the second\nquadrant (shown as the continuous curve). Since it must match with the inner Stokes\nsurface, we see that it is active, and it switches on a subdominant complex ray. This\nthen grows in amplitude while the original diminishes until they are of comparable size\nalong the anti-Stokes surface x2 = 0, x1 < \u2212\n\u221a\n3\/2. This, of course, provides the two\npropagating rays exterior to the caustic. As we sweep still further, we meet another\nsolution of (112), this time shown as a dotted curve in the third quadrant. This is\nalso active, again because of matching in to the Airy Stokes structure, and switches\noff the original ray with which we started, which is now subdominant when compared\nto the new complex ray switched on at the previous Stokes line. The one remaining\ncomplex ray now survives all the way back to x2 = 0, x1 > \u2212\n\u221a\n3\/2. The solution it\nyields there is identical to that given by the original ray. Note that when this ray was\nswitched on at the first Stokes line, it corresponded to the branch of the square root\nin (56) in contrast to the ray with which we started. What has happened is that we\nhave now circled the branch point, and the two ray solutions are actually two sheets\nof the Riemann surface of the phase function u. If we wish to assign a \u201clabel\u201d to each\nray at each point in complex space (such as the \u201cincoming\u201d and \u201coutgoing\u201d labels\nwhich distinguish between the two rays in x2 = 0, x1 < \u2212\n\u221a\n3\/2), then as we circle\nthe branch point our label will have to switch at some point (the branch cut). We\nprefer, however, to work with the Riemann surface, rather than insert branch cuts,\nand label the rays only when they are real. In section 6 we will find the need to label\nrays for all complex x and y, and in that case we will have to introduce branch cuts.\nWe shall return to this point shortly, when we discuss the detailed structure within\nan individual complex ray.\nFigure 17 shows a different cross section, this time for y = 2. In this case the\nintersection with the caustic is at (\u00b1i\u221a3, 2) and the Stokes surfaces must therefore\nemanate from the vicinities of these points. Notice that in this case, the intersection\nof the cross section with the physical domain x2 = 0, \u2212\u221e < x1 < \u221e contains two\npropagating real rays, as expected.\nWe now return to the question of the structure within any one ray. The way\nwe have set things up, the real rays meet the caustic at t = 0, so that negative and\npositive values of t correspond to incoming and outgoing portions of the ray, and this\nsplit is unambiguous for real values of t. We might then ask about corresponding\ninterpretations, if there are any, for complex values of t. More importantly, we need\nto know whether or not the ray actually exists for all complex values of t; after all, we\nhave seen that complex rayfields do not exist everywhere since they are switched on\nand off across Stokes surfaces. Thus it is not unreasonable to expect that individual\ncomplex rays are themselves \u201ccut\u201d along certain directions.4\nWe begin by noting that by symmetry the structure within all rays will be the\nsame, although in more general circumstances this will not necessarily be the case.\nUsing the ray equations (50)\u2013(52) to write\nt = (r2 \u2212 1)1\/2,(113)\n4The fact that this can happen in practice is illustrated by the excitation of a surface ray on\nan elastic structure coupled with a compressible fluid. In [39] it was found that the surface ray was\nexcited by a critically incident complex ray but that it did not occupy all regions of the boundary.\nThis is an example of a complex ray (the surface ray) lying in a two-dimensional, planar manifold\nbut occupying only a portion of this plane. The ray is cut across a certain direction and only exists\non one side of it. The analysis in [39] gave a strong indication that the mechanism for doing this is\nStokes\u2019 phenomenon.\nON THE THEORY OF COMPLEX RAYS 447\nFig. 18 Structure of a single ray (t \u2208 C, s constant) for the circular caustic.\nthe equal-phase condition (112) can be written in the form\nRe\n[\ntan\u22121 t\u2212 t] = 0,(114)\nand this is shown graphically in Figure 18. This figure shows three equal-phase curves,\nBE, AD, and CF. We observe that the branch point behavior of the phase u as a\nfunction of r has been \u201copened out\u201d by considering u as a function of t (cf. (113))\ninstead. The individual portions A and D of AD map to the same line in r space; on\nany individual ray, the lines A and D correspond to different values of \u03b8, but for each\npoint on the line A on one ray there is another ray for which the corresponding point\non the line D maps to the same point in (x, y) space.\nFor values of t on the lines B, D, and F the ray is the dominant ray of the two rays\nthrough that point in space, while for values of t on the lines A, C, and E the ray is\nsubdominant. The equal-phase lines B and E correspond to the equal-phase line that\nis not a Stokes line. On the equal-phase line A the ray is switched off by the second,\ndominant, ray, whose value of t lies on the line D. Similarly, on the equal-phase line\nC the ray is switched off by the second ray, whose value of t lies on the line F.\n448 CHAPMAN, LAWRY, OCKENDON, AND TEW\nThus the diagram shows that the ray is switched off across the two curves A and\nC and exists only for complex values of t lying below these two curves. Where this\nswitching occurs can, of course, also be interpreted as the intersection of the global\nStokes surface engendered by the caustic with the complex ray. Each complex ray\nwill either intersect the caustic at a real point, in which case its intersection with real\nspace is a propagating ray, or at a complex point, in which case it will pass through\nthe interior of the caustic. Either way, the structure of the ray is the same. Suppose\nthe ray is of the former type. Values of t for which t2 = 0, t1 > 0 (t1 < 0) can then\nbe identified as the outward (inward) propagating portion of a real ray having passed\nthe tangency point t = 0 with the caustic. This ties in with the ideas of Figure 16,\nwhere we can see that in the region given by x2 = 0, x1 >\n\u221a\n3\/2 there are two rays,\none incoming and the other outgoing. Inside the caustic in real space, where x2 = 0,\nx1 <\n\u221a\n3\/2 in Figure 16, we see that there is only one ray. Since r < 1 in this case,\nt must be purely imaginary, and since Figure 18 shows us that no ray contains the\nrange of values of t for which t1 = 0, t2 > 0, we deduce immediately that this ray\nmust be \u201cinitiated\u201d at a complex point on the caustic and propagate a negative purely\nimaginary \u201cdistance\u201d to reach the interior of the physical caustic.\nThus the planes that are the rays are also cut along Stokes surfaces. The Stokes\nsurfaces determine which parts of the ray are active, and in this sense they replace\nthe laws of causality applied to real rays.\n(c) Optimal truncation. Having identified the Stokes surfaces for the circular caustic,\nlet us see how they arise via optimal truncation of the dominant ray expansion. This\nwill shed further light on the mechanism that decides which of the equal-phase surfaces\nare Stokes surfaces.\nFor the circular caustic solution of the transport equations we have\nA0 =\n1\u221a\u2212t , An independent of s for all n.\nHence, using the general expression (30), we find\nAn =\n3n\u2211\nj=n\ngn,j\ntj+1\/2\n,(115)\nwhere\ngn+1,j = \u2212 12j\n[\n(j \u2212 1\/2)2gn,j\u22121 + (j \u2212 5\/2)(j \u2212 1\/2)gn,j\u22123\n]\n(116)\nwith g0,0 = i. We expect that gn,j will be of the order of n! as n \u2192 \u221e, so we define\ngn,j = (\u22121)nn!bn,j . We can also reduce the order of the recurrence relation by setting\nk =\nj \u2212 n\n2\n, bn,j = cn,k, bn,j+2 = cn,k+1, bn+1,j+1 = cn+1,k,\nto give\ncn+1,k+1 =\n(2k + n+ 5\/2)2\n2(n+ 1)(2k + n+ 3)\ncn,k+1 +\n(2k + n+ 5\/2)(2k + n+ 1\/2)\n2(n+ 1)(2k + n+ 3)\ncn,k.(117)\nTaking the dominant balance as n\u2192\u221e gives\ncn+1,k+1 \u223c\n(\n2k + n\n2n\n)\n[cn,k+1 + cn,k] .(118)\nON THE THEORY OF COMPLEX RAYS 449\nNow setting w = k\/n, cn,k \u223c B\u02c6(n, k)en\u03c8(w), where | log(B\u02c6)| = o(n), and letting\nn\u2192\u221e gives\ne\u03c8e(1\u2212w)\u03c8\n\u2032\n=\n(\nw +\n1\n2\n)(\n1 + e\u03c8\n\u2032)\n,(119)\nwhere a prime denotes d\/dw. We can solve for gn,n and gn,3n exactly to give the\nfollowing boundary conditions on (119):\n\u03c8(0) = log 1\/2,(120)\n\u03c8(1) = log 3\/2.(121)\nNote that since (119) is first order, we require only one boundary condition; the other\nshould be automatically satisfied and provides a check on the analysis.\nLet us return to the expression for the An for a moment. We have\nAn =\n3n\u2211\nj=n\ngn,j\ntj+1\/2\n=\n3n\u2211\nj=n\n(\u22121)nn!bn,j\ntj+1\/2\n\u223c n!\u221a\nt\n3n\u2211\nj=n\n(\u22121)nB(n, j)en\u03c8((j\u2212n)\/2n)\ntj\n,(122)\nwhere B(n, j) = B\u02c6(n, k). Writing j = vn and approximating the final sum by an\nintegral gives\nAn \u223c nn!\nt1\/2\n\u222b 3\n1\nB(n, vn) exp\n(\nn\n[\n\u03c8\n(\nv \u2212 1\n2\n)\n\u2212 v log t+ ipi\n])\ndv.(123)\nDefining\nf(v) = \u03c8\n(\nv \u2212 1\n2\n)\n\u2212 v log t,\nwe have\nAn \u223c nn!\nt1\/2\n\u222b 3\n1\nB(n, vn) exp (n [f(v) + ipi]) dv(124)\nwith\nt3efe(3\u2212v)f\n\u2032\n=\nv\n2\n(\n1 + t2e2f\n\u2032)\n,(125)\nwhere a prime represents d\/dv. Applying the method of steepest descents to (124) we\nfind that the dominant contribution occurs near v0, where f \u2032(v0) = 0, and is given by\nAn \u223c CB(n, v0n)nn!\nt1\/2\nexp (n [f(v0) + ipi])(126)\nfor some constant C. From (125) we see that\nef(v0) =\nv0(1 + t2)\n2t3\n.(127)\n450 CHAPMAN, LAWRY, OCKENDON, AND TEW\nThus we need to find v0. Differentiating (125), using (125) to eliminate f , and writing\ng = f \u2032 gives\ng\u2032 =\n1 + t2e2g\nv(t2e2g(1\u2212 v) + 3\u2212 v)(128)\nwith boundary conditions g(1) = \u221e, g(3) = \u2212\u221e. By writing v = v(g), we find that\nthe solution to (128) is given by\nv =\nt3e3g\n(1 + t2e2g)(teg \u2212 tan\u22121(teg) + a) .(129)\nThe boundary conditions imply that a = 0.\nFrom (126) and (127) we see that\nAn \u223c CB(n, v0n)nn!\u221a\nt\n( \u22121\n2(t\u2212 tan\u22121 t)\n)n\n.(130)\nNow that we have the leading-order behavior of An, we can optimally truncate and\nobserve the Stokes switching exactly as in section 4.3. The condition (110) gives the\nStokes surfaces as\n\u2212i\n2(t\u2212 tan\u22121 t) real and positive.(131)\nNote that this is consistent with the equal-phase surfaces (114), namely,\nRe[tan\u22121 t\u2212 t] = 0,(132)\nbut it also identifies which of the equal-phase surfaces are Stokes surfaces. As t\u2192 0,\nt \u2212 tan\u22121 t \u223c t3\/3. Thus the Stokes surfaces are given by arg t = pi\/2, 7pi\/6, 11pi\/6,\nas t \u2192 0. The ray is not present at arg t = pi\/2, and so this line cannot be a Stokes\nsurface. The other two are exactly the lines D and F of Figure 18.\nFinally, we note that there may be an easier way to deduce the leading-order\nasymptotic behavior of An than the one employed. Anticipating replacing the sum in\nthe expression for An by an integral and performing steepest descents, we expect to\nfind\nAn \u223c \u039b\u0393(n+ \u03b3)\nFn\nas n\u2192\u221e,(133)\nwhere \u039b, \u03b3, and F may be functions of s and t but are independent of n (in (126),\nF = eipi+f(v0)). If we use this ansatz directly in (25) and retain only leading-order\nterms as n\u2192\u221e, we find that\n\u22122F\u03c4 = \u03b12F 2\u03c3 + F 2\u03c4 +\n2\u03b12(\u03b2\u2032 \u2212 u\u20320)F\u03c3F\u03c4\n\u03c42\n+\n\u03b12(\u03b2\u2032 \u2212 u\u20320)2F 2\u03c4\n\u03c42\n.(134)\nIn the present example \u03b2 = 0, \u03b1 = 1, u\u20320 = 1, and F = F (\u03c4), giving\nF\u03c4 = \u2212 2\u03c4\n2\n1 + \u03c42\n.(135)\nHence\nF = \u22122(\u03c4 \u2212 tan\u22121 \u03c4),\nin agreement with (130).\nON THE THEORY OF COMPLEX RAYS 451\nFinally, we offer a word of warning about using (134) to determine the behavior\nof An as n\u2192\u221e. The ansatz (133) is very similar to a WKB ansatz, and exactly the\nsame problems associated with analytic continuation and Stokes lines occur in the\napproximation of An as in the original approximation of \u03c6. (This is related to the\nphenomenon known as resurgence [5].) We can see this more clearly with reference\nto (124). In general, f will have many saddles, and, as s and t vary, different saddles\nmay be picked up by the integral, other saddles may dominate, and the saddle we\nstarted with may be switched off. Thus care needs to be taken, and this limits the\nusefulness of (134).\n5. Nonanalytic Solutions of Helmholtz Equation. In solving the inner problem\nfor the circular caustic (63), we chose the solution that was exponentially small as\n\u03c1\u2192 \u2212\u221e, giving f = C Ai(\u221221\/3\u03c1). Let us consider here two other solutions of (63),\ngiven by choosing different branches of the cube root of 2, namely,\nf = C Ai(\u2212e2ipi\/321\/3\u03c1),(136)\nf = C Ai(\u2212e4ipi\/321\/3\u03c1).(137)\nThe Stokes lines for these solutions are given by rotating Figure 15 through 2pi\/3 and\n4pi\/3 radians, respectively, and are shown in Figure 19.\nIn each case there are two rays present as \u03c1 \u2192 \u2212\u221e, and so the solution is\nexponentially large there, but only one ray is present as \u03c1\u2192\u221e. The solution (136),\nshown in Figure 19(a), has the outgoing ray only as \u03c1 \u2192 \u221e, while solution (137),\nshown in Figure 19(b), has the incoming ray only, as shown in Figure 20.\nThe solution (136) is the caustic for the acoustic ring source [9] and is produced,\nfor example, by a small propeller rotating at a Mach number less than 1 in the interior\nof the circle r = 1. The caustic is at the sonic radius, and the outgoing wavefield is\nexponentially small by comparison with the wavefield in the vicinity of the propeller.\nWhen we examine the Stokes surface structure of the outer problem for the acous-\ntic ring source, we find we have a different set of active Stokes surfaces from those\nshown in Figures 16 and 17, and the corresponding picture is shown in Figures 21 and\n22. The Stokes surface cuts the Riemann surface of u in such a way that the incoming\nwavefield is not present in the exterior of the caustic. However, we see from Figures 21\nand 22 that another problem has emerged. The Stokes surface on the imaginary axis\nterminates at the points x = \u00b1iy, corresponding to r = 0. What is then to stop us\nfrom analytically continuing the solution around this point to obtain the physically\nunrequired incoming wavefield in x2 + y2 > 1, as indicated in Figure 23?\nIf we examine the rays for this solution we see the same problem. The active\nportion of each ray is shown in Figure 24. The Stokes surface meeting the ray on\nt1 = 0 again terminates at t = i, corresponding to r = 0; the Stokes surface itself does\nnot divide the ray into two halves.\nThe root of this problem becomes immediately clear if we consider the exact\nsolution of the Helmholtz equation. Separating the variables in polar coordinates\ngives \u03c6 = f(r)eik\u03b8 with f = Jk(kr) + iYk(kr). Hence, in this case f itself has a\nbranch point at the origin and is in fact a multivalued function living on a Riemann\nsurface with infinitely many sheets. Thus, when we analytically continue around\nr = 0, we pass onto a different sheet of the Riemann surface. Hence we have to\ninclude branch cuts in Figures 21 and 22 to indicate the end of one Riemann sheet\nand the start of the next, as shown in Figures 25 and 26.\n452 CHAPMAN, LAWRY, OCKENDON, AND TEW\nFig. 19 Stokes lines and ray structure for the solutions (a) (136) and (b) (137); d and s indicate\nthe dominant and subdominant rays, respectively, while S and AS indicate the Stokes lines\nand anti-Stokes lines.\nON THE THEORY OF COMPLEX RAYS 453\nFig. 20 Rays contained in the far-field approximations of (136) and (137).\nFig. 21 Stokes surface for the acoustic ring source in the plane x = x1 + ix2, y = 0.5; x1, x2 \u2208 R.\nThere is an important point to be made here. We emphasized earlier that the\nphase u is a multivalued function living on a Riemann surface and that this surface\nends, or is cut, at the Stokes surfaces of the solution; the branch points of u are\nthe caustics of the wavefield. For the acoustic ring source, \u03c6 itself is a multivalued\nfunction whose branch cuts we have had to insert as part of our solution procedure\nin order to ensure single-valuedness.\nIn the first case the branch points are branch points of the approximation, and are\nsmoothed via an inner analysis in the vicinity of the caustic. There is no singularity\nin the exact solution, and the \u201ccuts\u201d in the Riemann surface are not arbitrary but are\ndetermined by Stokes\u2019 phenomenon. The cuts do not indicate that we have moved onto\nanother sheet of the Riemann surface but rather that that sheet is not present (i.e.,\n454 CHAPMAN, LAWRY, OCKENDON, AND TEW\nFig. 22 Stokes surface for the acoustic ring source in the plane x = x1 + ix2, y = 2; x1, x2 \u2208 R.\nFig. 23 Analytically continuing to the other side of the Stokes surface in Figure 22.\nON THE THEORY OF COMPLEX RAYS 455\nFig. 24 Ray structure for the acoustic ring source.\nFig. 25 Stokes surface and branch cuts for the acoustic ring source in the plane x = x1 + ix2,\ny = 0.5; x1, x2 \u2208 R.\n456 CHAPMAN, LAWRY, OCKENDON, AND TEW\nFig. 26 Stokes surface and branch cuts for the acoustic ring source in the plane x = x1 +ix2, y = 2;\nx1, x2 \u2208 R.\nthat the amplitude of the corresponding wavefield is zero). For example, in the region\nlabeled \u201c2 rays\u201d in Figure 16 the rays corresponding to both sheets of the Riemann\nsurface of u are present, but in the region labeled \u201c1 ray\u201d the ray corresponding to\nthe one sheet of the Riemann surface is not present\u2014it was switched off across the\nStokes surface.\nIn the second case the singularity is in the exact solution, so that the exact\nsolution is multivalued and we must use radiation or extinction conditions to decide\nwhich solution branch is the physically relevant one. The branch cuts may be placed\narbitrarily and do not represent an end to the Riemann surface but rather a jump\nfrom one sheet to another.\nIf we now move to look at the ray picture, we find that the rays themselves\nare Riemann surfaces, with branch points at t = \u00b1i, and that branch cuts must be\ninserted in Figure 24 also, as shown in Figure 27. There is now no contradiction\nregarding the active part of each ray.\nWe see that in fact the outgoing and incoming caustics (136) and (137) each\ncorrespond to one sheet of the multivalued solution; that is, they are joined together\nby analytic continuation. The other sheets correspond to multiples of the circular\ncaustic solution superimposed on either of these.\nIn summary, when the exact solution has singularities, the Stokes surfaces may\nterminate and branch cuts will need to be introduced into the Riemann surface of the\nphase and the rays. As we discussed in section 3, such situations are generic, since\nON THE THEORY OF COMPLEX RAYS 457\nFig. 27 Ray structure for the acoustic ring source (shaded region shows where the ray is active).\nwhen we analytically continue, say, inside a closed reflecting body, we are effectively\nsolving the Cauchy problem in a bounded domain. In fact, the \u201coutgoing-only\u201d caustic\ncan account for some of the spurious rays in Figure 11. If we analytically continue\nthe reflected field back into a convex scatterer, there will be a caustic of the wavefield\nin the interior (see Figure 28). Since we do not want the incoming part of the rays\nto be present for the solution to be physically acceptable, this caustic must be an\noutgoing-only caustic. The solution inside the caustic will be exponentially large and\nmay well contain branch points, but this will not happen in physical space.\n6. Examples. Although we do not have systematic rules for determining which\nof the equal-phase surfaces are Stokes surfaces, let us now illustrate our theory of\ncomplex rays by applying it to some specific problems.\nWe will consider first a model problem, which has similarities with the problem of\ntotal internal reflection, but which has the advantage that there is a relatively simple\nFourier transform solution.\n6.1. Model Problem. Consider the following model problem:\n\u22072\u03c6+ k2\u03c6 = 0 in y > 0,(138)\n\u03c6 = eikx\n2\/2 on y = 0,(139)\n\u03c6 outgoing at infinity.(140)\nSolving the ray equations we find that p = s, q =\n\u221a\n1\u2212 s2, so that\nx = (1 + t)s,(141)\ny = t\n\u221a\n1\u2212 s2,(142)\n458 CHAPMAN, LAWRY, OCKENDON, AND TEW\nFig. 28 Caustic (dotted curve) obtained by analytically continuing the reflected field due to an in-\ncident plane wave on a circular cylinder back into the scatterer.\nFig. 29 Real rays in the problem (138)\u2013(140).\nu = s2\/2 + t,(143)\nwhere the positive branch of the square root is taken for \u22121 < s < 1, so that the real\nrays are outgoing. The real ray solution is illustrated in Figure 29.\nThere are two points to notice. First, rays coming from points on the boundary\n|s| > 1 immediately leave real space. Second, the real ray solution (141)\u2013(143) re-\nstricted to |s| \u2264 1 does not satisfy the boundary data on |x| > 1. Thus there must\nON THE THEORY OF COMPLEX RAYS 459\nFig. 30 Caustic of the rays (141)\u2013(142).\nbe an evanescent wavefield present for |x| > 1, y \u001c 1, corresponding to complex rays.\nLet us use our theory of complex rays to calculate this wavefield and its domain, that\nis, the region in which complex rays should be added to obtain exponential accuracy\nin the solution.\nWe first determine the number of rays present when (141), (142) are complexified.\nEliminating t gives\n(x\u2212 s)2(1\u2212 s2) = s2y2.(144)\nThis is a quartic for s, and hence there will be four rays through any one point.\nWe can identify these rays more easily by examining the caustics associated with the\nwavefield. We find from (14) that \u03b2(s) = 1 \u2212 s2, so that the caustic is given by\nt+ 1\u2212 s2 = 0 or, equivalently,\nx2\/3 + y2\/3 = 1.\nThis curve is plotted in real space in Figure 30.\nThe rays can now be identified as the tangents to this curve. Through points\ninside the caustic we see that there are four real tangents, so that all the rays are\nreal. As we cross the caustic, two points of tangency coalesce, and two of the real\nrays become complex rays. Thus, through points outside the caustic there are two\nreal rays and two complex rays.\nOf the four real rays, ray 4 corresponds to the required outgoing ray, while rays\n1, 2, and 3 correspond to incoming rays and should therefore not be present. Of\nthe two complex rays one will form our evanescent wavefield, but the other will be\nexponentially large and not present.\n460 CHAPMAN, LAWRY, OCKENDON, AND TEW\nFig. 31 Equal-phase surfaces (solid curves) in problem (138)\u2013(140). The caustic is also shown\n(dashed curve).\nWe know that the complex ray must be present for |x| > 1, y \u001c 1. However,\nwe know that it cannot be present inside or near the caustic in the upper half-plane,\nsince the real rays that form this caustic are incoming and therefore not present. Thus\nthe complex ray must be switched off across some lines in the upper half-place (the\nintersection with the Stokes surfaces), and these lines must pass through the points\n(\u22121, 0) and (1, 0), respectively.\nTo identify the Stokes surfaces we first need to find the equal-phase surfaces, that\nis, all surfaces on which two of the four rays have equal phase. We find that the two\ncomplex rays have equal phase everywhere outside the caustic in real space, since they\nform a complex conjugate pair of roots to (144). The equal-phase paths of any pair\nof real rays do not intersect real space. However, the equal-phase surfaces for one real\nand one complex ray do intersect real space and are shown in Figure 31.\nAs we would expect, the real ray which has the same phase as the complex rays is\nray 4. The evidence so far strongly suggests that the portions of these last equal-phase\nsurfaces emerging from x = \u00b11, y = 0 are indeed Stokes surfaces, and that we have\nthe situation shown in Figure 32.\nTo confirm this let us examine the Fourier transform solution of the problem\n(138)\u2013(140). We find\n\u03c6 = \u2212\n\u221a\ni\n2pik\n\u222b\nexp(\u2212i\u03bb2\/(2k)\u2212\n\u221a\n\u03bb2 \u2212 k2 y + i\u03bbx) d\u03bb,(145)\nwhere we will identify the contour of integration and the branch of the square root\nON THE THEORY OF COMPLEX RAYS 461\nFig. 32 Rays contained in the solution of problem (138)\u2013(140).\nshortly. We are interested in the asymptotic approximation to (145) as k \u2192 \u221e. We\nremove the branch point by making the substitution \u03bb = k cos \u03b8. Then\n\u03c6 =\n\u221a\nik\n2pi\n\u222b\nsin \u03b8 exp(\u2212ik[(cos2 \u03b8)\/2 + y sin \u03b8 \u2212 x cos \u03b8]) d\u03b8,(146)\nwhere the contour runs between two \u201cvalleys\u201d at npi\u00b1i\u221e and will be specified shortly.\nThere are no singularity or end-point contributions, and so the saddle points corre-\nspond to the rays, as shown in section 2.1; as expected, there are four in the period\n\u2212pi < \u03b81 < pi, where \u03b8 = \u03b81 + i\u03b82, \u03b81, \u03b82 real. Now we can identify which contour we\nrequire by identifying the saddles with the rays, since we know which rays we expect\nto be present for x and y small. For such x and y the saddles are given by \u03b8 \u223c y,\npi\/2\u2212 x, pi \u2212 y, \u2212pi\/2 + x, giving ray contributions\nu1 \u223c \u22121\/2 + x\u2212 y2\/2,(147)\nu2 \u223c \u2212y + x2\/2,(148)\nu3 \u223c \u22121\/2\u2212 x\u2212 y2\/2,(149)\nu4 \u223c y + x2\/2.(150)\nThus we require a contour that passes only through the saddle near \u03b8 = \u2212pi\/2 +x for\nsmall x and y. This identifies the contour as that shown in Figure 34(a).\nNow let us vary x and y so as to circumnavigate the point x = 1, y = 0 and thus\nobserve the switching on of the complex ray. We find the sequence of steepest descent\npaths shown in Figures 34 and 35 with the implications in real space indicated in\nFigure 33; it is indeed only those components of the equal phase surface of Figure 31\nwith cusps at (1, 0) and (\u22121, 0) that are active.\nNotice the \u201cdouble\u201d Stokes surface in the analytic continuation of the solution\ninto the lower half-plane, on which the real ray turns on the second complex ray while\nitself being turned off by the first complex ray. The two complex saddles then coalesce\nat the lower caustic to form the one real outgoing ray. Note also that the solution in\nthe vicinity of the lower caustic is different from that in the vicinity of the caustic in\n462 CHAPMAN, LAWRY, OCKENDON, AND TEW\nFig. 33 Diagram showing the points in real space corresponding to the steepest descent paths in\nFigures 34 and 35. The caustic (dotted curve) and Stokes surface (solid curve) are shown.\nsection 3. Here, as in the \u201coutgoing-only\u201d caustic in section 5, there are two complex\nrays on one side and only one real ray on the other.\nLet us now see if we could have deduced that the equal-phase contour of Figure 32\nis \u201cactive\u201d if we had not had the Fourier transform solution (145) available.\nWe will consider the problem locally near x = 1, since if the Stokes line is active\nthere, it will be active along its length by a continuity argument.

Let us write\n\u03b7 = t\u00af\/s\u00af, for reasons which will become clear later.

The solid line is the integration\npath required for the solution to our problem; steepest descent paths through other saddles\nare dotted.

Total Internal Reflection. Let us now examine the problem of total internal\nreflection which we introduced in section 2.3, but with a line source rather than plane\nwave incidence (Figure 36). We have\n\u22072\u03c61 + k21\u03c61 = \u03b4(x)\u03b4(y \u2212 h), y > 0,(180)\n\u22072\u03c62 + k22\u03c62 = 0, y < 0,(181)\n\u03c61 = \u03c62 on y = 0,(182)\n\u2202\u03c61\n\u2202y\n= \u03bb\n\u2202\u03c62\n\u2202y\non y = 0.(183)\nA line source at the point (0, h), h > 0, gives an incoming wavefield\n\u03c6inc = H\n(1)\n0 (k1(x\n2 + (y \u2212 h)2)1\/2)\n\u223c 1\u221a\nk1(x2 + (y \u2212 h)2)1\/4\neik1(x\n2+(y\u2212h)2)1\/2 .\nRay Solution. Let us first examine the ray solution of the problem. Writing\n\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c6inc = A(1)eik1u1 ,(184)\n\u03c62 = A(2)eik2u2 ,(185)\nON THE THEORY OF COMPLEX RAYS 467\nFig. 36 Line source incidence in the problem of total internal reflection (180)\u2013(183). Only the\nincident and transmitted rays are shown for clarity.\nwe find that in order to satisfy the continuity conditions at the interface we must have\nk1u1 = k2u2 = k1(x2 + h2)1\/2.(186)\nHence we have the ray solution\nx = s+\nst\n(s2 + h2)1\/2\n,(187)\ny =\nht\n(s2 + h2)1\/2\n,(188)\nu1 = (s2 + h2)1\/2 + t(189)\nin y > 0 and\nx = s+\nnst\n(s2 + h2)1\/2\n,(190)\ny = \u2212 (h\n2 \u2212 s2(n2 \u2212 1))1\/2t\n(s2 + h2)1\/2\n,(191)\nu2 = n(s2 + h2)1\/2 + t(192)\nin y < 0, where n = k1\/k2 > 1. Let us consider the solution in the lower medium and\nits analytic continuation into y > 0. Eliminating t, we find\n(x\u2212 s)2(h2 \u2212 s2(n2 \u2212 1)) = n2y2s2.(193)\nThis is a quartic equation for s, and hence there will be four rays through any one\npoint. To identify these four rays let us find the caustics associated with them. We\nfind that \u03b2 is given by\n\u03b2 =\n(s2 + h2)1\/2(h2 \u2212 s2(n2 \u2212 1))\nh2n\n(194)\n468 CHAPMAN, LAWRY, OCKENDON, AND TEW\nFig. 37 Caustic in the problem of total internal reflection (180)\u2013(183) with n = 2, h = 1. The\ncaustic in the upper half-space is that which is generated by analytically continuing the\ntransmitted ray back into this half-space. The caustic in the lower half-space is the reflection\nof this. Neither will be present in the physical solution.\nso that the equation of the caustic t+ \u03b2 = 0 is given parametrically by\nx =\ns3(n2 \u2212 1)\nh2\n,(195)\ny =\n(h2 \u2212 s2(n2 \u2212 1))3\/2\nh2n\n,(196)\nwhich is shown in Figure 37.\nAs in the previous problem, we can identify the rays as the tangents to this curve.\nInside the caustic all the rays are real, while outside the caustic there are two real\nand two complex rays.\nWe see that the only ray that should be present inside the caustic in the physical\nsolution is ray 2. However, as before, this ray will not satisfy the boundary data for\n|x| > x0 = h\/\n\u221a\nn2 \u2212 1, y = 0, and so, close to x > x0, y = 0, one of the complex rays\n1 and 4 must be present (the smaller one). Thus there must be a Stokes surface across\nwhich a complex ray is switched on or off somewhere outside the lower caustic (since\nthe complex ray is not present at the caustic). If we plot the equal-phase surfaces of\nthe rays we again find that the complex rays, coming from complex conjugate roots\nof (193), have equal phase wherever they exist. Again, for any pair of real rays the\nequal-phase surfaces do not intersect real space, but for the case of one real ray and\none complex ray we find the equal-phase surfaces shown in Figure 38. Thus we expect\nON THE THEORY OF COMPLEX RAYS 469\nFig. 38 Equal-phase surfaces (solid curves) for the problem (180)\u2013(183).

This is motivated by the ray\nsolution and moves the branch points at \u00b11 to infinity, while infinity moves to the\nbranch points \u00b1i. Thus we expect our contour now to start and finish at these branch\npoints. We find\nf(w\u00af) = f\u02dc(s) =\n1\u221a\n1 + s2\n(\nh\u2212 y\nn\n(1\u2212 (n2 \u2212 1)s2)1\/2 + sx\n)\n.(205)\nLet us now remove the branch point at s = 1\/\n\u221a\nn2 \u2212 1 by setting s = (1\/\u221an2 \u2212 1) cos \u03b8.\nWe find\nf\u02dc(s) = f\u02c6(\u03b8) =\n(\nn2 \u2212 1\nn2 \u2212 sin2 \u03b8\n)1\/2(\nh\u2212 y\nn\nsin \u03b8 +\nx cos \u03b8\u221a\nn2 \u2212 1\n)\n.(206)\nWe can now clearly see the interaction of the saddles in the \u03b8-plane. The steepest\ndescent contours are plotted in Figures 41 and 42 as x and y vary about the point\n(x0, 0), and the implications in physical space are plotted in Figure 40. The behavior\nof the steepest descent contour is qualitatively the same as in the previous example,\nas might have been expected. We see that the complex saddle is switched on across\nthe Stokes surface, as expected.\nWe find that g is given by\ng(w\u00af)dw\u00af = g\u02c6(\u03b8)d\u03b8 = \u2212 1\n2pii\n(n2 \u2212 1)1\/2 sin \u03b8\nn2 \u2212 sin2 \u03b8\n(\n1\n1 + (\u03bb\/n) sin \u03b8\n)\nd\u03b8.(207)\nNote that the branch point has been removed from g also, and that we are left with\nonly a pole. Since this pole lies on the negative real axis, we see from Figures 41\nand 42 that the steepest descent path never crosses it for real x and y, so that its\ncorresponding rayfield never contributes in real space.\nLet us now examine the reflected wavefield. Here it is well known that the inter-\naction between the steepest descent contour and the branch cut in g(w\u00af) leads to the\nswitching on of a head wave [7, 41]. If we perform the same substitutions on \u03c6ref as\nwe did on \u03c62, we again remove the branch cut from g, and the head wave arises more\nconveniently as a saddle contribution.

Let us now consider the problem of\nthe complexification of the shadow boundary of a smooth scatterer. We will examine\nfirst the scattering of a real plane wave by a cylinder \u2126 \u2282 R2, for which the asymptotic\nsolution in real space is well known [21, 19]. In the following section we will consider\nthe scattering of a complex plane wave by a cylinder, for which the point of tangency\nis in complex space.\nWe have\n\u22072\u03c6+ k2\u03c6 = 0, (x, y) \u2208 R2\\\u2126,(216)\n\u03c6 = 0, (x, y) \u2208 \u2202\u2126(217)\nON THE THEORY OF COMPLEX RAYS 473\nFig. 42 Steepest descent paths for \u03c62 in the problem (180)\u2013(183).

Without loss of generality we take this point to be the origin x = 0, y = 0 and\nparametrize the boundary so that this point corresponds to s = 0.\nIn [21, 29] it has been proposed that wherever an incoming ray is externally\ntangent to a smooth convex boundary, it initiates a special type of surface ray, called\n474 CHAPMAN, LAWRY, OCKENDON, AND TEW\nA E\nDCB\nH FG\nxx0\nh\ny\nFig. 43 Points in space corresponding to the steepest descent paths in Figures 44 and 45.

As this ray propagates around the body it continuously sheds further rays,\nwhich we shall call creeping rays, that leave the boundary tangentially. With this\ngeometrical prescription we can see that the boundary must be a caustic for the shed\nrays and hence that the creeping-ray phenomenon can be thought of as a boundary\nlayer effect. Corroboration of this idea in the form of uniform asymptotic theories has\nbeen provided in [2, 30]. In order to adopt a systematic asymptotic approach, it is\nnecessary to perform a detailed local analysis of the wave structure close to the point\nof tangency.

This should fit in with Keller\u2019s theory, in\nwhich the creeping field \u03c6c is constructed as a modal expansion in the form\n\u03c6c \u223c e\nik(s+t)\n\u221a\nt\n\u221e\u2211\nm=0\nfm(s)eik\n1\/3vm(s).(228)\nThe ray coordinates (s, t) are to be interpreted as follows (see Figure 48): for an\nobservation point O in the shadow region, construct the tangent to the scatterer\n478 CHAPMAN, LAWRY, OCKENDON, AND TEW\npassing through that point. Then t is the distance along this tangent (i.e., along the\nshed ray) from the body to the observation point, and s is the arc-length along the\nboundary between the point Q of original incident ray tangency and the point P of\nemission of the shed ray.\nA successful match between (227) and (228) is possible provided that the functions\nfm(s) and vm(s) arising in (228) are given by\nfm(s) =\npi1\/221\/6e5pii\/12Ai(\u2212\u03bb2me\u22122pii\/3)\nk1\/6\u03ba(s)1\/3Ai\u2032(\u2212\u03bb2m)\n,(229)\nvm(s) = \u2212\u03bb2me\u22122pii\/32\u22121\/3\n\u222b s\n0\n\u03ba(q)2\/3 dq,(230)\nwhere \u03ba(s) is the curvature of the body and \u2212\u03bb2m (m = 0, 1, 2, . . .) are the zeros of the\nAiry function. Thus the strength of the surface creeping ray is decaying exponentially\n(with exponent proportional to k1\/3) as it propagates around the boundary. There\nis no such decay along the shed creeping rays; these rays are real rays, albeit with\nexponentially small magnitude.\nThe complex-ray picture of this situation depends not so much on the amplitude\n(into which we can absorb the eik\n1\/3vm(s) modulation) of the creeping field but on the\nphase and ray structure, since it is this that generates the Stokes surfaces responsible\nfor switching. From (228), we see that the phase is u = s+ t, and this can be used to\ngenerate the ray expansion of the creeping field in the form\nx = x0(s) + tx\u20320(s),(231)\ny = y0(s) + ty\u20320(s),(232)\nu = s+ t.(233)\nLet us first consider one of the questions posed in section 3, namely, the com-\nplexification of the shadow boundary. We ignore surface creeping rays that either\ncircumnavigate the scatterer or originate at another tangency point; such rays can\nalways be added in later. In real space the shadow boundary lies along y = 0, x > 0:\nfor y > 0 the reflected and incident rays are present, while for y < 0 the creeping ray\nis present.\nLet us examine the solution in the vicinity of the shadow boundary, that is, for\nx of order 1 and positive, and y small. With the ansatz \u03c6 = Aeikx we find that the\ncorrect scaling for y is y = k\u22121\/2y\u00af, giving\n\u22022A\n\u2202y\u00af2\n+ 2i\n\u2202A\n\u2202x\n= 0,(234)\nto leading order (see Figure 47).\nAs we approach the shadow boundary from the outer ray region, the phases of\nthe reflected and creeping fields are given by\nur \u223c x+ y\n2\n2x\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,(235)\nuc \u223c x+ y\n2\n2x\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 .(236)\nNow we could attempt to match these fields with a similarity solution of (234) in the\nform A = A(\u03b7), where \u03b7 = y\/\n\u221a\nx, giving\nA\u2032\u2032 \u2212 i\u03b7A\u2032 = 0,(237)\nON THE THEORY OF COMPLEX RAYS 479\nwhere \u2032 \u2261 d\/d\u03b7, and hence\nA(\u03b7) = Fr(\u03b7) =\ne\u2212ipi\/4\u221a\n2pi\n\u222b \u03b7\n\u2212\u221e\neiv\n2\/2 dv.(238)\nThen, as y\u00af \u2192\u221e,\nA(x, y\u00af) \u223c 1\u2212 ie\n\u2212ipi\/4\n\u221a\n2pi\n\u221a\nx eiy\u00af\n2\/(2x)\ny\u00af\n,\nwhile, as y\u00af \u2192 \u2212\u221e,\nA(x, y\u00af) \u223c \u2212 ie\n\u2212ipi\/4\n\u221a\n2pi\n\u221a\nx eiy\u00af\n2\/(2x)\ny\u00af\n.\nSince the solution A = 1 represents the incident field, (238) does indeed switch off the\nincident field across the shadow boundary, and as y \u2192 \u00b1\u221e, the phase of A matches\nwith the phases (235) and (236).\nUnfortunately, however, the amplitude of A does not match smoothly into either\nthe reflected or creeping fields as |y\u00af| \u2192 \u221e.

Unfortunately, the form of the solution\n(244) satisfies (243) exactly for any f , so that to determine f we need to match inwards\nto the Fock\u2013Leontovich region. The details of this matching can be found in [38].\nThis triple layer structure of the shadow boundary introduces a new ingredient\ninto the procedure we suggested in section 4.4. Let us first consider the inner Fresnel\nregion, in which the solution is given by (238). As |\u03b7| \u2192 \u221e there are two rays in the\napproximation of (238). The first is A \u223c 1, which matches with the incident field.\nThe second is\nA \u223c \u2212 ie\n\u2212ipi\/4\n\u221a\n2pi\n\u221a\nx eiy\u00af\n2\/(2x)\ny\u00af\n,\nwhich corresponds to either the creeping or reflected field, depending on the value of\ny\u00af, which are indistinguishable in this inner region. The Stokes line structure of A for\ncomplex \u03b7 is essentially that of the error function rotated by pi\/4. There are active\nStokes lines at arg \u03b7 = 3pi\/4 and 7pi\/4 at which the incident field is turned off and on.\nThe structure is shown schematically in Figure 49.\nLet us now consider the transition zones. In this case we need to determine\nthe Stokes line structure of the function f(\u03be) in (244). Unfortunately, the form of\nf resulting from the matching with the Fock\u2013Leontovich region is so complicated\nthat we have found it impossible to discern the switching on and off of the incident,\nreflected, and creeping fields by looking at its Stokes lines.\nThus we have no alternative but to resort to the more practical but less complete\nprocedure of section 4.4 which, we recall, does not require detailed knowledge of the\ngenesis of the Stokes surface.\nON THE THEORY OF COMPLEX RAYS 481\nFig. 50 The Stokes structure of the reflected and creeping fields in the vicinity of the shadow bound-\nary. The bold lines indicate the Stokes lines, while the light lines indicate equal-phase lines\nthat are not Stokes lines. The notation C > R is used to indicate lines on which the creeping\nfield is dominant, and vice versa.\nThe position of the Stokes lines at which the incident field is switched on and off\nis dominated by the prefactor eiky\n2\/(2x) in (241), (242), so that these lines should pass\nstraight through the transition regions. Here we are more interested in the reflected\nand creeping fields, particularly since the incident field has a terminating asymptotic\nexpansion and hence can never be responsible for switching another rayfield on or off.\nWe need to determine the Stokes lines of the function f(\u03be) as |\u03be| \u2192 \u221e. The phase\nof this function is \u03be3\/(8\u03ba0) for the reflected field and \u2212v\u2032m(0)\u03be for the creeping field.\nHence, as |\u03be| \u2192 \u221e the equal-phase lines are given by Re(\u03be3) = 0, i.e., arg \u03be = pi\/6,\npi\/2, 5pi\/6, 7pi\/6, 3pi\/2, 11pi\/6, and these are the lines across which Stokes switching\nis possible. We know that for \u03be \u2192 \u221e we have only the reflected field present, while\nfor \u03be \u2192 \u2212\u221e we have only the creeping field present. Let us start from arg \u03be = 0 and\nanalytically continue anticlockwise in a large circle, as in Figure 50. The first equal-\nphase line we meet is at arg \u03be = pi\/6. However, since the reflected field is subdominant\nto the creeping field on this line, the creeping field cannot be switched on, and this\nequal-phase line cannot be a Stokes line. At the next equal-phase line, arg \u03be = pi\/2,\nthe reflected field is dominant, and we have the possibility that the reflected field\nswitches on the creeping field. Indeed, it must do so, since at the next equal-phase\nline the reflected field is subdominant, and we know that the creeping field must be\npresent by the time we reach arg \u03be = pi. Thus arg \u03be = pi\/2 is an active Stokes line. At\nthe next equal-phase line the creeping field is dominant and must turn off the reflected\nfield, since we know that the reflected field is not present for arg \u03be = pi.\nContinuing into Re(\u03be) < 0, the next equal-phase line is at arg(\u03be) = 7pi\/6, at which\nthe creeping field is subdominant. Thus this equal-phase line cannot be a Stokes line.\nThen, at the equal-phase line arg(\u03be) = 3pi\/2, the creeping field is dominant and must\n482 CHAPMAN, LAWRY, OCKENDON, AND TEW\nswitch on the reflected field, since this is the last chance to do so before we reach\narg(\u03be) = 2pi, where we know that the reflected field must be present. At the final\nequal-phase line, arg(\u03be) = 11pi\/6, the reflected field is dominant and must switch off\nthe creeping field, since the creeping field is not present for arg(\u03be) = 2pi. Thus we\nhave been able to determine the Stokes structure for complex \u03be.\nWhen we examined the solution in the vicinity of a caustic in section 4.4 we\nwere able to check the structure derived from such an analytic continuation argument\nagainst the exact solution. Here, for reasons mentioned above, we have no exact\nsolution to check against, but as in section 4.3 we can confirm the structure shown in\nFigure 50 by considering the limit\nlim\nn\u2192\u221e arg\niAn\nAn\u22121\nfor the reflected field. We aim to show that as s \u2192 0 there are Stokes surfaces at\narg \u03be = pi\/2 and arg \u03be = 11pi\/6. Since we will be considering the ray solution as s\u2192 0,\nwe will now be considering the inner limit of the outer solution. Previously we have\nbeen considering the outer limit of the inner solution but, of course, the two should\nbe equivalent.\nAs s\u2192 0 we have, from (218)\u2013(221),\nx0 \u223c s\u2212 \u03ba\n2\n0s\n3\n6\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,(247)\ny0 \u223c \u2212\u03ba0s\n2\n2\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,(248)\nu\u20320(s) \u223c 1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,(249)\n\u03b2\u2032(s) \u223c \u22121\/2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,(250)\n\u03b1(s) \u223c \u2212 1\n2\u03ba0\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 .(251)\nSubstituting these limits into (31)\u2013(33) we find that\ngn+1,m+1,j \u223c \u2212 132j\u03ba20\n[\n4g\u2032\u2032n,m,j\u22121 \u2212 12(j \u2212 2)g\u2032n,m,j\u22122\n+9(j \u2212 5\/2)(j \u2212 1\/2)gn,m,j\u22123] ,(252)\ngn,0,0 \u223c \u2212\nn\u2211\nm=1\n3m\u2211\nj=m\ngn,m,j\n(\u2212s\/2)j ,(253)\ng0,0,0 \u223c \u2212(\u2212s\/2)1\/2.(254)\nThus\ngn,m,j \u223c an,m,j(\u2212s\/2)3n\u2212j\u22121\/2 ,(255)\nwhere\nan+1,m+1,j = \u2212 132j\u03ba20\n[(3n\u2212 j + 1\/2)(3n\u2212 j + 3\/2)an,m,j\u22121\n\u2212 6(3n\u2212 j + 3\/2)(j \u2212 2)an,m,j\u22122\n+9(j \u2212 5\/2)(j \u2212 1\/2)an,m,j\u22123] ,(256)\nan,0,0 = \u2212\nn\u2211\nm=1\n3m\u2211\nj=m\nan,m,j ,(257)\na0,0,0 = \u22121.(258)\nON THE THEORY OF COMPLEX RAYS 483\nHence\nAn \u223c\n(\n\u2212 s\n2\u03c4\n)1\/2 n\u2211\nm=0\n3m\u2211\nj=m\nan,m,j\n(\u2212s\/2)3n\u2212j\u03c4 j .(259)\nNow, as s\u2192 0 with t of order 1 we find\nAn \u223c\n(\n\u2212 s\n2\u03c4\n)1\/2 an,0,0\n(\u2212s\/2)3n .(260)\nBy calculating the first few terms in (256) we observe that an,0,0 = (\u22121)nbn, where\nbn is real and positive.

Hence there are Stokes surfaces at which the reflected\nfield switches on or off another rayfield wherever i\/s3 is real and positive, i.e., on\narg(s) = pi\/6, 5pi\/6, 3pi\/2. As s \u2192 0, s \u223c \u2212y\/(2\u03ba0x) = \u2212\u03be\/(2\u03ba0). Hence there will\nbe Stokes surfaces at arg(\u03be) = pi\/2, 7pi\/6, 11pi\/6. However, since we are working with\nthe tail of the WKB expansion of the reflected field, the reflected field must itself be\npresent for these lines to be Stokes surfaces. This rules out the line arg(\u03be) = 5pi\/6,\nand we have confirmed the Stokes surfaces at which the reflected field is responsible\nfor the Stokes switching as arg(\u03be) = pi\/2 and arg(\u03be) = 11pi\/6.\nWe have now given the best argument we can to identify the Stokes surfaces\nemanating from the shadow boundary s \u2192 0, t \u2192 0. Clearly this situation breaks\ndown as we approach the tangency point s = t = 0. We can in principle find the\nStokes surfaces near this point from the far-field analysis of (227) for complex x, y.\nHowever, we have been unable to do this, and we again resort to our equal-phase\narguments. Indeed, armed with the equal-phase surfaces for each pair of the incident,\nreflected, and creeping rayfields, and with a knowledge of the local structure near the\nshadow boundary and the caustics of both the reflected and creeping fields, we hope\nto be able to synthesize all the components of the Stokes surface using consistency\narguments, rather like building up a picture of a phase plane from a knowledge of the\nsolution paths close to the stationary points.\nThe starting point is the ray solution as we emerge from the Fock\u2013Leontovich\nregion, so let us look locally near the tangency point by rescaling\ns = \u000f\u03ba\u22122\/30 s\u00af, t = \u000f\u03ba\n\u22122\/3\n0 t\u00af,(262)\nx = \u000f\u03ba\u22122\/30 x\u00af, y = \u03ba\n\u22121\/3\n0 \u000f\n2y\u00af, u\u2212 x = \u000f3u\u00af,(263)\nwhere k\u22121\/3 \u001c \u000f \u001c 1. Thus we are looking close to the tangency point, but not\nso close that we are in the inner diffraction region, and we may still use the ray\nsolution.

The equal-phase surfaces of u\u00afr1 and u\u00afr2 will give the Stokes surfaces for\nthe caustic in the reflected field.\nNext, in the local coordinates (262)\u2013(263), the creeping field (228) becomes\nx\u00af = s\u00af+ t\u00af,(271)\ny\u00af = \u2212 s\u00af\n2\n2\n\u2212 s\u00aft\u00af,(272)\nu\u00af =\ns\u00af3\n6\n+\ns\u00af2t\u00af\n2\n,(273)\ngiving\ns\u00af = x\u00af\u00b1\n\u221a\nx\u00af2 + 2y\u00af,(274)\nt\u00af = \u2213\n\u221a\nx\u00af2 + 2y\u00af,(275)\nu\u00afc1 =\n1\n3\n(\n\u2212x\u00af3 \u2212 3x\u00afy\u00af + (x\u00af2 + 2y\u00af)3\/2\n)\n,(276)\nu\u00afc2 =\n1\n3\n(\n\u2212x\u00af3 \u2212 3x\u00afy\u00af \u2212 (x\u00af2 + 2y\u00af)3\/2\n)\n.(277)\nWe see that u\u00afc1 corresponds to an outgoing creeping ray, propagating into the shadow\nzone, while u\u00afc2 corresponds to the other possibility of an incoming creeping ray.\nThe incident field is given by u\u00af = 0, but we consider here only the reflected and\ncreeping rays. As we have already mentioned, since the incident field has a terminating\nasymptotic expansion it cannot be responsible for the switching on or off of another\nrayfield, and we can therefore always add it in later once we have determined the\ndomains in which each of the reflected and creeping fields is active.\nIn order to picture the Stokes structure we need to choose a two-dimensional slice\nof the space of complex x\u00af and y\u00af. In fact, we can allow three degrees of freedom if\nwe choose x\u00af to be real and consider complex y\u00af, since the equal-phase surfaces depend\nonly on \u03b7 = y\u00af\/x\u00af2. We find that \u03b7 = \u22121\/2 corresponds to the cylinder (which is the\ncaustic of the creeping field), \u03b7 = \u22122\/3 corresponds to the caustic of the reflected\nfield (which is inside the cylinder), and \u03b7 = 0 corresponds to the shadow boundary.\nBecause we now have to consider four rays and two caustics, working with a Rie-\nmann surface for the reflected field and the creeping field becomes hard to picture, and\nso for the present problem we label the two reflected rays ur1 and ur2 and introduce\na branch cut across which ur1 becomes ur2 and vice versa. We emphasize that the\nbranch cut is needed only because we wish to give an unambiguous name to each ray\nat each point, and the square root singularity in the phase means that there must be\nON THE THEORY OF COMPLEX RAYS 485\nFig. 51 Equal-phase contours near the tangency point of a smooth cylindrical scatterer for x > 0.\nThe figure shows the complex \u03b7 plane, where \u03b7 = y\/x2.

For x > 0 the shadow boundary has the structure shown\nin Figure 50, the creeping-ray caustic has the structure of an outgoing-only caustic\n(as shown in Figure 19), and the reflected caustic is not present at all since neither\nreflected ray is present for y real and less than zero.\nFor x < 0, the rays uc2 and ur2 are not present near the shadow boundary y = 0,\nthe creeping-ray caustic is not present since neither creeping ray is present for x < 0,\n486 CHAPMAN, LAWRY, OCKENDON, AND TEW\nFig. 52 Equal-phase contours near the tangency point of a smooth cylindrical scatterer for x < 0.\nThe figure shows the complex \u03b7 plane, where \u03b7 = y\/x2.

A Stokes surface, once active, can only cease to\nbe active when it meets another Stokes surface, and hence, on the basis of consistency\nalone, the Stokes surface is as shown in Figures 53 and 54: for x < 0 we can determine\nall the components, but for x > 0 we are left with more than one possibility in a\nnumber of places.\nBecause no complex rays meet real space in this problem, no physical significance\ncan be attached to Figures 53 and 54. However, if the cylinder was illuminated by\na complex plane wave, there would be complex-ray contributions to the solution in\ncertain parts of real space, and we now examine this situation.\nON THE THEORY OF COMPLEX RAYS 487\nFig. 53 Stokes structure near the tangency point of a smooth cylindrical scatterer for x > 0.

Scattering of a Complex Plane Wave by a Cylinder. We have seen in\nFigures 53 and 54 the intricate Stokes surface that exists in complex space around\nthe tangency point of a grazing ray in real space. Suppose, now, that the tangency\npoint was in complex space. We might expect some of this structure to be projected\ninto real space.\nWe consider the problem of a complex plane wave incident upon a cylinder. Let\nthe incoming field be described by \u03c6 \u223c eik(x cos a+y sin a), where a is now complex.\n488 CHAPMAN, LAWRY, OCKENDON, AND TEW\nFig. 54 Stokes structure near the tangency point of a smooth cylindrical scatterer for x < 0. The\nfigure shows the complex \u03b7 plane, where \u03b7 = y\/x2. The shadow boundary (which is not\npresent for x < 0) corresponds to \u03b7 = 0, the cylinder to \u03b7 = \u22121\/2, and the caustic of the\nreflected field to \u03b7 = \u22122\/3.

Nevertheless, a local diffraction problem can be formulated around the tangency\npoint, exactly as in the real case, and it leads to the formation of creeping rays in\nexactly the same way. To determine the domains in real space in which the incident,\nreflected, and creeping rays are present, we need to examine the Stokes surface of the\nsolution.\nLet us assume that the imaginary part of a is small, so that the incoming wave\nis almost a real plane wave, and exhibits only a gradual exponential modulation in\nthe direction (\u2212 sin Re(a), cos Re(a)). Then the tangency points will be close to real\nspace, and we can perform a local analysis as before. We fix the origin of (x, y) and\nparametrize the cylinder as before, so that\nx0(0) = 0, y0(0) = 0, x\u20320(0) = 1, y\n\u2032\n0(0) = 0, y\n\u2032\u2032\n0 (0) < 0.\nIf we take the real part of a to be zero, then the tangency point will be close to the\norigin.

Before we do so, let us make some further observations.\nWe have seen that the tangency point is (\u2212ib, b2\/2). The ray through this point,\nwhich is the \u201cshadow boundary,\u201d is given by\nx\u00af = \u2212ib+ t\u00af,(302)\ny\u00af =\nb2\n2\n+ ibt\u00af.(303)\nThis ray intersects real space in the point x = 0, y = \u2212b2\/2, which is inside the\ncylinder (which is given by y\u00af = \u2212x\u00af2\/2 in the local coordinates). The caustic for the\nreflected field is given by\n\u2212b2 + 2ibx\u00af+ 4x\u00af2 + 6y\u00af = 0(304)\nand intersects real space at the point x = 0, y = b2\/6, which is outside the cylinder.\nThe caustic for the creeping rays coincides with the cylinder as before. Note that,\nalthough the reflected and incident rays are complex rays, the creeping rays are always\nreal rays for a convex scatterer in two dimensions, since they must form a caustic at\nthe boundary of the scatterer.5 At concave parts of a boundary, whispering gallery\nmodes will be set up that will result in complex creeping rays since the exterior of the\nscatterer now corresponds to the interior of the creeping-ray caustic.\nLet us now turn to the equal-phase surfaces. As before we need to introduce\nbranch cuts across which ur1 becomes ur2 and vice versa. We choose the branch\ncut for the reflected field to lie on the positive y axis from y = b2\/6, and define the\nbranches so that ur1 = o(x3) as x\u2192\u221e.\nWe do not need to worry about a branch cut for the creeping field, since in real\nspace it is not possible to circumnavigate the caustic of this field. However, we do\nneed to define the branches in the interior of the cylinder. We choose uc1 to be such\nthat (x2 + 2y)3\/2 is negative imaginary for y < \u2212x2\/2.\n5It can be shown that in three dimensions the surface creeping rays follow geodesics and may\nthemselves form caustics on the boundary of the scatterer. In this case complex creeping rays would\nbe shed from the dark side of these caustics.\nON THE THEORY OF COMPLEX RAYS 491\nFig. 55 Equal-phase contours for the scattering of a complex plane wave (with b = 1) by a smooth\ncylinder. The figure shows real (x\u00af, y\u00af) space, and the cylinder (whose interior is shaded)\ncorresponds to y\u00af = \u2212x\u00af2\/2.\nAs before, we concentrate first on the reflected and creeping fields. The equal-\nphase surfaces are shown in Figure 55 for x\u00af and y\u00af real and for b = 1. In Figure 56 we\nshow a more detailed diagram of the structure near the origin.\nWe now have to decide which of the equal-phase surfaces in Figure 55 are \u201cactive\u201d\nStokes surfaces. As b\u2192 0 we expect to retrieve the solution to the problem of a real\nincident plane wave, with the caustic of the reflected field and the tangent ray both\ntending to the point x\u00af = 0, y\u00af = 0, and the equal-phase lines A, B, C all tending to\nx\u00af > 0, y\u00af = 0, forming the shadow boundary. As x\u00af \u2192 \u2212\u221e we expect the reflected\nray u\u00afr2 to be present, while as x\u00af \u2192 \u221e with y\u00af < 0 we expect the creeping ray u\u00afc2 to\nbe present. Thus we arrive at the picture shown in Figures 57 and 58. The Stokes\nsurface A intersects the cylinder at the point x\u00af = \u2212\u221a3 b and is parallel to the tangent\nthrough this point at infinity.\n492 CHAPMAN, LAWRY, OCKENDON, AND TEW\nFig. 56 Enlarged diagram near x\u00af = y\u00af = 0 for the scattering of a complex plane wave (with b = 1)\nby a smooth cylinder.

The complete picture of active Stokes surfaces is\nshown in Figure 61: it would be of interest to see if an accurate numerical simulation\nor a sensitive measuring device could pick up the complex wavefields. We will return\nto this idea in the conclusion.\n7. Nonanalytic Boundaries. One of the perceived failings of complex-ray theory\nat present is its inability to handle nonanalytic boundaries, since the first step in\nthe solution procedure is to analytically continue the boundary and the boundary\ndata. However, we found in section 5 that the solution to the Helmholtz equation\nin C2 will generically contain branch points, even when the boundary and boundary\ndata are smooth. This gives us some hope that nonanalytic boundaries can also be\naccounted for, and indeed we will find that when the boundary contains isolated points\nON THE THEORY OF COMPLEX RAYS 493\nFig. 57 Reflected\/creeping Stokes surfaces for the scattering of a complex plane wave (with b = 1)\nby a smooth cylinder.

Thus, in theory, piecewise analytic\nboundaries can be handled by complex rays.\nLet us consider first the simplest problem with a nonanalytic boundary, the Som-\nmerfeld problem of the reflection of a plane wave by a half-line (see Figure 62).\nLet \u03b1 be the angle the incident plane wave makes with the half-line, which is given\nby y = 0, x < 0, as shown in Figure 62.

The Stokes\nsurfaces are simply the Stokes surfaces of the Fresnel integral, Fr(z), and are therefore\nat arg z = 3pi\/4, 7pi\/4; there are equal-phase surfaces that are not Stokes surfaces at\narg z = pi\/4, 5pi\/4.

By equating the real parts of the diffracted and the incident\/reflected\nfields we find that (328), (329) may be written as\n\u03b8\u2217 = \u2212\u03b11 + cos\u22121\n( \u22121\ncosh\u03b12\n)\n,(330)\n\u03b8\u2217\u2217 = \u03b11 + cos\u22121\n( \u22121\ncosh\u03b12\n)\n,(331)\nwhere the branch of cos\u22121 is chosen so that the imaginary part of the incident\/reflected\nphase is larger than the imaginary part of the diffracted phase (that is, the diffracted\nfield is dominant). Thus we see that the shadow boundaries may be rotated by up to\npi\/2 in either direction depending on the value of \u03b12. This is clear also from Figure 64.\nChanging the value of \u03b12 corresponds to moving the origin of the Stokes surfaces up\nor down in this figure, as seen in Figures 65\u201368. Clearly, the intersection of the Stokes\nsurfaces with real space will then change by up to an angle of pi\/2. In the right-hand\nsides of Figures 65\u201368 we show the behavior of the ray solution in real space, where\nthe arrows indicate the normals to the level curves of Re(u), which would be the ray\ndirections, were the rays real. These are also the level curves of Im(u), and thus\nindicate lines of constant magnitude of the wavefield.\nNote that in Figure 66(b) the Stokes surfaces have actually crossed the branch\ncut, so that the ones that were active in Figure 66(a) have moved up onto the second\nbranch, while those on the second branch have moved down onto the first branch.\nAgain, it would be interesting to know if these predictions could be detected by\na sensitive measuring device.\n7.1.

Motivated by the need for ever-more-accurate representations of\nhigh-frequency wavefields, we have tried to give a systematic description of a theory\nof complex rays in the frequency domain. Our aim has been to assemble a theory that\nis consistent in an applied mathematical sense and whose implementation is feasible\nin practical situations.\nGeometrically, our starting point has been the interpretation of complex rays as\nmanifolds in the complexified space of the independent variables in the Helmholtz\nequation. Usually the phase function is defined on a multiple-sheeted Riemann man-\nifold in this complexified space, and the asymptotic analysis of successively higher\nterms in the ray expansion inevitably involves Stokes\u2019 phenomenon and the switch-\ning on and off of complex rayfields across suitably defined \u201cStokes surfaces.\u201d In this\narticle, these are three-dimensional manifolds in a four-dimensional complex space.\nAlthough it is easy to find all the possible components of these surfaces by using\nthe recipe (98), not all these \u201cequal-phase\u201d components are active in any particular\nproblem. We have only been able to give a comprehensive delineation of the active\ncomponents for some of the problems discussed in sections 5\u20137, including ones for\n506 CHAPMAN, LAWRY, OCKENDON, AND TEW\n-2 -1.5 -1\n-0.5 0.5 1 1.5 2\n-2\n-1.5\n-1\n-0.5\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\nFig. 69 Stokes lines for the diffraction of a Gaussian beam by a half-line. With the notation of\nsection 2.3 for the beam b1 = 0, b2 = 1, and \u03b1 = \u2212pi\/4, all with respect to an origin fixed\nat (\u22121, 0). The lines are the normals to the level curves of Re(u), which is the direction\nof energy flow. These are also the level curves of Im(u), and thus they indicate lines of\nconstant magnitude of the wavefield. The incident beam is red, the reflected beam is blue,\nand the diffracted rays have been omitted for clarity. The fading intensity of the colors\ncorresponds to the exponential decay of the wavefield.\nwhich checks using explicit or Fourier-transform representations are available, but we\nare confident that most of the \u201cactive\u201d structure for general smooth convex scattering\nproblems can be found using (98) and (110).\nAlthough our work relies heavily on analytic continuation, we have found that it\ncan be applied even in the presence of nonanalytic boundaries, for which the GTD is\nthe appropriate tool in real-ray theory. We find that the GTD can still be used, but\nthe singularities that are generically present outside physical space due to the process\nof analytic continuation are now also to be found at the points of nonanalyticity of\nthe boundary. Nonetheless, quite surprising complex-ray pictures emerge from such\nsingularities, for example, as illustrated in section 7 for half-lines illuminated by plane\nwaves and Gaussian beams.\nIn summary we envisage the following general procedure for tackling problems\ninvolving complex rays:\n1. Solve the eikonal equation to identify all the \u201couter\u201d incident, reflected, and\ntransmitted rays, real and complex.\nON THE THEORY OF COMPLEX RAYS 507\n2. Identify singularities in the rayfields such as tangency points (real or complex)\nand nonanalytic boundary points.\n3. Solve the inner diffraction problems near these points to determine the diffracted\nor creeping fields that must be added to the outer ray expansion.7\n4. Identify the equal-phase surfaces between pairs of rayfields.\n5. Identify which of these equal-phase surfaces are Stokes surfaces.\nThe main difficulty arises in step 5, for whose implementation we have three tools at\nour disposal:\n1. Either some of the local diffraction problems may have explicit integral solu-\ntions available whose Stokes surface structure can be determined by inspec-\ntion. Whether or not branches of the equal-phase surfaces are Stokes surfaces\nin the ray solution can then be identified by using continuity arguments;\n2. or in some regions of space we may know which rays we expect to be present\non physical grounds, and we can then use consistency arguments to determine\nwhich equal-phase surfaces are Stokes surfaces;\n3. or it may be possible to use information from the tail of the asymptotic ex-\npansion of one rayfield to determine whether it is responsible for the switching\non of another ray through Stokes\u2019 phenomenon.\nIn practical terms tools 1 and 2 are more useful than tool 3, although there may be\nsome occasions in which 3 proves useful. Note in particular that tool 3 implies that a\nray contribution that has a converging asymptotic expansion (including, in particular,\na terminating asymptotic expansions such as a plane wave) can never be responsible\nfor switching another wavefield on or off.\nApart from the above-mentioned incompleteness of our characterization of which\nequal-phase surfaces are in fact \u201cactive\u201d Stokes surfaces, other problems that await\nattention include the illumination of boundaries where the curvature changes sign,\nproblems for the Helmholtz equation in interior domains, problems in three space\ndimensions or in the time domain, and the generalization of complex-ray theory to\nmore complicated partial differential equations.\nOur analyses in sections 6.2, 6.4, and 7 show clearly that while incident, reflected,\ncreeping, and head rays at the boundary in real space are all real, complex rays can be\nexcited at points of the complexified boundary that do intersect real space. Moreover,\nby using (98) and (110) it is possible to identify the curves (Stokes surfaces) in real\nspace across which the complexified wavefields are switched on and off.\nOne methodological aspect of our work that deserves mention concerns the de-\npendence of our prediction on our particular choice of (1) as the ansatz for \u03c6. If, for\nexample, we had written u = iu\u2032 in (1), the restriction of the rays associated with\nu\u2032 to real values of s and t would have been different from that for u. However, if\nall rays are considered complex rays, they are the same for u\u2032 as for u: they simply\nhave different parametrizations. Thus, while the choice of ansatz is at the discretion\nof the investigator, all predictions about \u03c6, in particular its Stokes-surface structure,\nare ansatz independent. Our choice in this paper has been that which accords with\nmost of ray theory literature.\nThe question of the physical significance of complex rays remains a contentious\none. In an experimentally measured wavefield, or in a numerical solution of the\n7Note that, as we saw in section 6.3, the inner solution near a complex tangency point is simply\nthe same as the solution near a real tangency point after a suitable complex rotation of coordinates,\nso that the creeping rays generated by complex tangencies will be the same as those generated by\nreal tangencies.\n508 CHAPMAN, LAWRY, OCKENDON, AND TEW\nHelmholtz equation, the Stokes lines will rarely be obvious: they will usually only\nemerge if the optimally truncated ray expansion is subtracted from the measured\nor calculated value, and then only if this value is sufficiently accurate. Of course,\nas a caustic is approached, the complex ray contributions become relatively larger;\nthus, if a Stokes surface intersects real space nearby, as occurs, say, in the case of a\ncusped caustic [44] and as occurred in section 6.2 near x = x0, then the switching\nphenomenon becomes easier to discern.\nFinally, we note that in cases such as the insonification of a cylinder by a complex\nplane wave in section 6.4, while it may not be too important to know exactly where\nthe Stokes switching has occurred, it is crucial to know that it has occurred, since the\nwavefield switched on will grow to dominate the switching wavefield at other points\nin space.\nAcknowledgments.
