Tree \ncanopy height, the percentage of gap in the canopy and the percentage of oak (in the wood only) \nwithin a 30 m radius of nest boxes were obtained from airborne remote-sensed data. Breeding \nsuccess was monitored and parental DEE (great tits: both habitats; blue tits: park only) was \nmeasured using doubly labelled water in birds feeding young. In the park, mean (\u00b1 SD) tree height \n(7.5 \u00b1 4.7 m) was less than in the wood (10.6 \u00b1 4.5 m), but the incidence of gaps (32.7 \u00b1 22.6%) \nwas greater (9.2 \u00b1 14.7%). Great tits and blue tits both reared fewer young in the park and chick \nbody mass was also reduced in park-reared great tits. Park great tits had a higher DEE (86.3 \u00b1 12.3 \nkJ day-1) than those in the wood (78.0 \u00b1 11.7 kJ day-1) and, because of smaller brood sizes, worked \nabout 64% harder for each chick reared. Tits in the park with more than about 35% gap around their \nboxes had higher DEEs than the average for the habitat. In the wood, great tits with less oak around \ntheir boxes worked harder than average. Thus structural gaps, and functional gaps generated by \nvariation in the quality of foraging habitat, increased the costs of rearing young.   \n \nKeywords airborne LiDAR \u00b7 ATM multi-spectral \u00b7 blue tit \u00b7 energy expenditure \u00b7 great tit \u00b7 habitat \nquality \u00b7 habitat structure \u00b7 parkland \u00b7 reproductive success \u00b7 urban birds \nIntroduction \nHabitat fragmentation and loss are two of the major causes of current worldwide declines in \nbiodiversity (Ehrlich and Wilson 1991; Heywood 1995). The extent of fragmentation in the UK \n(Fuller et al 1994) and elsewhere means that substantial proportions of many species populations \nnow live in such habitat (Vane-Wright et al 1991). For birds and other wildlife, small patches, \nwhether rural or urban, may constitute sub-optimal habitat. For example, small patches may lack \nfood resources and be more exposed to poor weather conditions and certain predators (Andr\u00e9n \n1992; Burke and Nol 1998; McCollin 1998). In urban parkland, structural patchiness can be \nexacerbated by functional patchiness due to high proportions of exotic plant species which may \nsupport relatively few invertebrates, reducing the foraging opportunities for birds (Mills et al 1989; \nReichard et al 2001, Stauss et al 2005). The wider diversity of plant species may also generate \ntemporal patchiness when differing phenologies create mismatches in timing between food supply \nand demand (Dias and Blondel 1996; Schoech and Bowman 2001; Thomas et al 2001). Thus birds \nliving in patchy habitat may have to travel more widely in search of food, increasing their workload \n(Eybert et al 1995; Hinsley 2000). Continuous woodland has fewer physical gaps, but food \nresources vary between both tree species and individual trees of the same species resulting in \nfunctional patchiness and a patchy use of territory by foraging birds (Naef-Daenzer 2000; Stauss et \nal 2005; Tremblay et al 2005).  \nIn this paper, we investigate the effects of structural and functional habitat gaps (quantified using \nairborne remote sensing) on parental energy expenditure (measured using doubly labelled water) \nand breeding success in great tits (Parus major) and blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) feeding young \nin urban parkland and in continuous woodland. Structural gaps are defined as physical spaces in the \ntree canopy; functional gaps are defined as arising from differences in the quality of different plant \nspecies as foraging habitat (Kennedy and Southwood 1984; Peck 1989; Lambrechts et al 2004; \nAlexander et al. 2006). For altricial nestlings, all food must be carried to the nest and thus breeding \nsuccess may be affected by the amount of time and energy the adults expend in crossing gaps. \n                                                                                                       3 \n \nSimilarly, the presence of gaps may increase travel times and distances if adults take longer routes \naround gaps to reduce potential exposure to aerial predators (Hinsley et al 1995; Desrochers and \nHannon 1997). Although principally forest birds, in the UK, great tits and blue tits are common \nbreeders in secondary habitats such as small woods, farmland hedgerow-tree networks and \nsuburban-urban gardens and parks. All these secondary habitats are characteristically patchy and \nreproductive success in both species is known to be reduced compared with continuous woodland \n(e.g. Schmidt and Steinbach 1983; Cowie and Hinsley 1987; Riddington and Gosler 1995; Hinsley \net al 1999). Both species also feed their young principally on tree-dwelling lepidopteran larvae \n(Perrins 1979; Perrins 1991) and the availability of caterpillars influences many aspects of tit \nbreeding ecology including chick growth, survival and recruitment (Haywood and Perrins 1992; \nKeller and van Noordwijk 1994; Tremblay et al., 2003). The abundance and distribution of the food \nsupply available to adults when feeding young can also affect adult body condition and survival by \nincreasing the time and energy demands of foraging (Tinbergen and Dietz 1994; Moreno et al 1995; \nMeril\u00e4 and Wiggins 1997; Sanz et al 1998; Thomas et al 2001). If structural and functional gaps \ninfluence foraging habitat quality, then we hypothesize that parental energy expenditure should \ncorrelate with the availability and quality of trees around the nest site. Thus birds in patchy habitat \nmay suffer the double penalty of having to work harder for a reduced reproductive success (Daan et \nal 1996).     \n \nMethods \nStudy sites \nThe two study sites were Bute Park (51o29\u2019 N, 3 o11\u2019 W) in Cardiff, south Wales, UK, and Monks \nWood National Nature Reserve (NNR) (52o24\u2019 N, 0 o14\u2019 W) in Cambridgeshire, eastern England, \nUK. Bute Park comprises about 53 ha and is located in the centre of the city of Cardiff, lying more \nor less north-south along the east bank of the River Taff (Fig. 1). The southern end includes Cardiff \nCastle, formal gardens, mown grass and an arboretum while the northern end has sports pitches and \n                                                                                                       4 \n \nsome more extensive areas of woodland. Tree species diversity is high with many exotics often \nplanted in groups of closely related species and varieties. The most abundant native species are \ncommon lime (Tilia europaea) and sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus), plus smaller amounts of \ncommon ash (Fraxinus excelsior) and occasional English oaks (Quercus robur). The most \nfrequently occurring species overall, including exotics, are limes (Tilia spp.), maples (Acer spp.), \noaks (Quercus spp.) and pines (Pinus spp.). Conifers constitute about 15% of all formally planted \ntrees. The park is heavily used by the public for recreation, sports, concerts and other events.   \n \n#Figure 1 approximately here# \n \nMonks Wood comprises 157 ha of mixed deciduous woodland (Gardiner and Sparks 2005) (Fig. \n1). It occupies a shallow north facing slope of maximum angle 14.5o and elevational range 6-46 m. \nThe dominant tree species, in order of abundance, are common ash, English oak and field maple \n(Acer campestre) and are well mixed throughout the wood. Other tree species include small-leaved \nelm (Ulmus minor), silver birch (Betula pendula) and aspen (Populus tremula), and the main shrub \nspecies are hawthorn (Crataegus spp.), blackthorn (Prunus spinosa) and common hazel (Corylus \navellana). These are all native species. The field layer is dominated by grasses and sedge (Carex \npendula). There is a network of paths and rides, some wide enough to create gaps in the canopy, \ntwo open fields (4.3 ha and 1.7 ha), a number of smaller glades and several ponds. On part of its \nsouthern boundary, the wood is adjoined across a minor road by a mature 37 ha conifer plantation.  \n \nSite data \n \nIn Bute Park, a total of 26 sites throughout the centre and north of the park were provided with \nwooden nest boxes, with a hole-diameter of 32 mm, allowing access by both great tits and blue tits. \nEach year, 19 boxes were available during the breeding season (typically late March to the end of \n                                                                                                       5 \n \nJune), the additional seven sites arising through replacement of vandalized\/stolen boxes. Boxes \nwere located randomly with a spacing of about 40-100 m. The position of each nest box was \nrecorded by differential GPS Real Time Kinematic survey (Topcon Hiper+ GPS receiver and \nLegacy-E Base Station) during winter, leaf-off conditions. Breeding success and energy expenditure \nof great tits was measured in Bute Park in 2003-2005, and in blue tits in 2004-2005. The extension \nof the project into 2005 in the park (but not in the wood, see below) was to compensate for a low \nsample size (one bird) in the park in 2003. In the park, in 2003-2005, the numbers of boxes in which \ngreat tits reached the chick-rearing stage were two, eight and five respectively, and energy \nexpenditure was measured successfully at one, six and five of these. In 2004-2005, the numbers of \nboxes in which blue tits reached the chick-rearing stage were nine and six respectively, and energy \nexpenditure was measured at six and four of these. \nIn Monks Wood, 36 nest boxes similar to those used in the park, and similarly located, were \navailable each year. The position of each box was recorded during winter, leaf-off conditions using \nan electronic total station (Pentax R-125N), surveying from an established Ordnance Survey \nbenchmark. Breeding success and energy expenditure of great tits was measured in Monks Wood in \n2003 and 2004, and breeding success of blue tits in 2004 and 2005. Energy expenditure was only \nmeasured in great tits in the wood because too few boxes were used by blue tits (great tits, being \nlarger, could out-compete blue tits for boxes). The numbers of boxes in which great tits reached the \nchick-rearing stage were 23 and 25 in 2003 and 2004 respectively and energy expenditure was \nmeasured successfully at 15 and nine of these. The numbers of boxes in which blue tits reached the \nchick-rearing stage in Monks Wood were five and two in 2004 and 2005 respectively. To obtain an \nadequate sample for blue tit breeding success in woodland, results from five boxes in another, \nsimilar, wood in Cambridgeshire were also used (Brampton Wood, 132 ha, mixed ash, oak, field \nmaple, 9 km south of Monks Wood). No other data for Brampton Wood were used here. Ambient \ntemperature was recorded in both Monks Wood and Bute Park using automatic loggers (Micro-T-\nlog temperature datalogger, F.W. Parrett Ltd.) recording every 4 hours. \n                                                                                                       6 \n \nCanopy height and habitat patchiness were measured using airborne Light Detection And \nRanging (LiDAR). Airborne scanning LiDAR is a remote sensing technique which can provide \nfinely resolved data describing vegetation structure (Lim et al 2003; N\u00e6sett 2004) of particular \nvalue for ecological applications (Lefsky et al 2002; Hill et al 2004; Bradbury et al 2005; Broughton \net al 2006; Hinsley et al 2006). It uses a laser range finder to measure the elevation of points in a \nswath beneath the flight-path of an aircraft. Short duration pulses of near infrared laser light are \nfired at the ground and the return signals backscattered from the ground itself and\/or surface \nfeatures such as trees and buildings are recorded (Wehr and Lohr 1999). The timing of the returns, \ncombined with measurement of the aircraft\u2019s orientation and position, allow the 3D position of the \nranged points to be calculated and geo-referenced (Ackermann 1999). Digital models of the surface \nof the ground and of vegetation canopy height can then be derived from these measurements (Hill et \nal 2002). Further details of the analysis of the LiDAR data are given in the supplementary material. \nLiDAR data for Bute Park were acquired on June 14th 2004 using an ALTM 3033 scanner, and \nfor Monks Wood on June 10th 2000 using an Optech ALTM 1210 scanner. The ALTM is a small \nfootprint (20-25 cm on the ground for these data sets), discrete return system supplying the first and \nlast significant return per laser pulse. The ALTM 3033 had a 33 kHz repetition rate, and data were \nacquired with a scan angle of \u00b1 20o and a post spacing of one hit per 1.66 m2. The ALTM 1210 had \na 10 kHz laser pulse repetition rate, and data were acquired with a scan angle of \u00b1 10o and a post \nspacing of one hit per 4.83m2. \nFor Monks Wood, a tree species map was also available, produced from supervised classification \nof time series Airborne Thematic Mapper (ATM) multi-spectral data from 2003 (George 2005). \nDifferent types of vegetation cover, and at a finer scale, different tree species, have characteristic \nreflectance spectra due to differential reflection of solar radiation (Treitz and Howarth 2000; \nCarleer and Wolff, 2004). Such differences between species can also be increased by differing leaf \nphenologies, e.g. rates of development and senescence (Wolter et al 1995; Mickelson et al 1998). \nThus, using ATM data from five images of the wood, the six dominant tree species (see above) in \n                                                                                                       7 \n \nthe top canopy were mapped with an assessed accuracy of c. 89%. The tree species map had a \nminimum height threshold of 8 m, which masked out areas of shrubs and young trees.   \n \nBird breeding performance \n \nAll boxes were visited approximately weekly from the end of March until July. The following \nparameters were recorded (i) first egg date, (ii) clutch size, (iii) hatching date, (iv) number of young \nalive in the nest at 11 days of age where day of hatching  = 0, (v) mean chick weight (g) at 11 days, \nexcluding runts (runts were defined as chicks too small to be ringed at age 11 days and were rare), \n(vi) total live biomass (g) of young in the nest at 11 days (including runts), (vii) number of young \nfledged, and (viii) overall success calculated as the percentage of eggs producing fledged young. \nChicks were weighed to 0.1 g using a spring balance, and were also ringed with a uniquely \nnumbered ring of the British ringing scheme run. After the young had fledged, the nest was \nremoved from the box and searched for dead chicks and unhatched eggs. \n \nBird energy expenditure \n \nEnergy expenditure of birds feeding young was measured using doubly labelled water (DLW). This \ntechnique uses the differential turnover of oxygen-18 (18O) (excreted from the body in water and \ncarbon dioxide) and deuterium (2H) (excreted in water) to measure carbon dioxide production \nwhich can then be converted to energy expenditure (Speakman 1997). The technique has been used \non a wide range of animals, including humans, and provides the best means of measuring energy \nexpenditure in free-living animals (Speakman 1998). Adults feeding c. 11 day-old young were \ntrapped at the nestbox, injected intraperitoneally with approximately 0.1 ml of DLW and a baseline \nblood sample collected after allowing 0.5 h for equilibration with the body water. Birds were then \nreleased to continue feeding the young and were retrapped about 24 hours later to collect a final \n                                                                                                       8 \n \nsample. To reduce disturbance at the nest, only one member of each pair was trapped. This was \nusually the female, but a few male blue tits were also trapped due to the greater difficulty of \ndistinguishing the sexes. Further details of the DLW methodology and analysis are given in the \nsupplementary material.  \nOf a total of 51 measurement attempts, 45 were successful, five failed (four great tits were not \nretrapped, one final sample dried out, all Monks Wood birds) and one park blue tit deserted and her \nbrood of four died. The broods of all the other 50 birds fledged. All trapping, sampling and storage \nprocedures were carried out under licence (see acknowledgements) and all operators were \nexperienced and licenced bird ringers. \n \nBird-habitat analysis \n \nData on mean tree canopy height and the percentage of gap (defined as canopy < 1 m tall) in the \ncanopy were extracted from the digital canopy height models of Monks Wood and Bute Park for 30 \nm radius circles centred on the nest box locations. In addition, for 22 of the 36 Monks Wood nest \nboxes, the percentage of oak tree canopy was also extracted per 30 m radius circle. This information \nwas extracted from the tree species map and was expressed as a percent of tree canopy rather than \nas a percent of the whole 30 m circle. However, given the low incidence of gaps in the wood, these \ntwo measures were similar for most boxes. Oak canopy could not be obtained for the remaining 14 \nMonks Wood boxes because the tree map did not include some woodland which lay outside the \nboundary of the NNR. A 30 m radius sample plot was used because this distance was representative \nof the typical foraging distances of tits (see discussion) (Stauss et al 2005; Tremblay et al 2005). \nForaging distances may be greater (e.g. 40-50 m) in lower quality habitat, but the amounts of gap \nfor radii of 30 m and 50 m were highly correlated (Bute Park: r = 0.957, P < 0.001, n = 26; Monks \nWood: r = 0.960, P < 0.001, n = 36), and using 30 m for both study sites minimised assumptions \nconcerning likely quality. \n                                                                                                       9 \n \nBreeding performance and parental DEE were summarised for each species and compared \nbetween the park and wood using two sample t tests. The effects of habitat structure (expressed as \nmean canopy height and percentage gap within 30 m in both the park and the wood, and as the \npercentage of oak canopy within 30 m in the wood) on parental DEE were examined using linear or \nquadratic regression analysis as appropriate to obtain best fit. Parental DEE was expressed as kJ \nday-1, and also as the percentage deviation from the mean DEE for each site calculated as (DEE \u2013 \nmean for the year)\/mean for the year. All analyses were done using Minitab Release 12. \n \n \nResults \n \nIn the park (n = 26), the mean canopy height within 30 m of each nest box was less than in the \nwood (n = 36) (mean \u00b1 SD canopy height: park = 7.5 \u00b1 4.7 m; wood = 10.6 \u00b1 4.5 m; t60 = -2.62, P = \n0.011). In particular, there were many more gaps in the tree canopy in the park (% gap: park = 33 \u00b1 \n23%; wood = 9 \u00b1 15%; t60 = 4.96, P < 0.001). In Monks Wood, the amount of gap was less than \n10% for 26 of the 36 boxes (Fig. 2), and less than 1% for 21 of them. The occurrence of gaps in the \nwood was related to the presence of large rides and proximity to the edge of the wood.  \n \n#Figure 2 approximately here# \nGreat tits in the park bred earlier than those in the wood, but all measures of breeding \nperformance were significantly reduced (Table 1). Female DEE was greater in the park (and the \ndifference close to significance at P = 0.058), but the smaller brood sizes and fledging success \nincreased the females\u2019 costs per chick by about 64% (Table 1). These differences between the park \nand the wood remained when comparing within the same year, i.e. 2004 (DEE: t13 = -2.47, P = \n0.028; DEE per chick: t13 = -3.58, P = 0.003, Table 1). In blue tits, there was no difference between \nthe park and the wood in the timing of breeding or clutch size, but fewer chicks were reared to \nfledging (Table 2). However, the quality of the young, measured as mean chick body mass (Lloyd \n1987; Slagsvold et al 1995), was comparable with that of woodland chicks. Earlier timing of \n                                                                                                       10 \n \nbreeding by urban great tits, but not blue tits, has been noted in previous work (Perrins 1979; Cowie \nand Hinsley 1987) and may be related to differential use of artificial food (Dhondt et al 1984).  \n \n#Tables 1 and 2 approximately here# \n \nIn the park (great tit, n = 12; blue tit, n = 10), we predicted that DEE would decrease with \ncanopy height and increase with the amount of gap around the box, and while these trends were \nevident for both species, the relationships were not significant. However, when DEE was expressed \nas the percentage deviation from the mean DEE for the year, females working harder than average \nwere found to have more patchy habitat around their nest boxes (great tits and blue tits combined, \none outlier omitted, Fig. 3). Daily energy expenditure, relative to the mean, decreased with \nincreasing canopy height and increased with increasing amounts of gap. The quadratic relationship \n(Fig. 3, % gap) showed that DEE, relative to the mean, was not linearly related to the amount of \ngap, but showed an increasing trend above about 35% gap. \n \n#Figure 3 approximately here# \n \nIn the wood (great tit, n = 23), two females had relatively high DEEs in 2003 (as apparent in Fig. \n4, see below). Without the results from these two birds, both DEE and the percentage deviation \nfrom the mean DEE for the year declined linearly with increasing canopy height (as found in the \npark), but the former relationship was weak (r2 = 0.17, P = 0.061, n = 21) and the latter non-\nsignificant and they are not shown. Gaps were relatively rare in Monks Wood (Fig. 2), and there \nwere no relationships with the amount of gap. However, both DEE and the percentage deviation \ndeclined as the percentage of oak canopy around the nest box increased (Fig. 4). Similar to the \npattern of results for canopy gaps in the park, as the percentage of oak decreased below about 30%, \nbirds worked increasingly harder. There was also an indication of a year effect. Both the females \n                                                                                                       11 \n \nwith the highest DEEs in 2003 had little oak within 30 m of their boxes, whereas the influence of \noak appeared to be less in 2004 (Fig. 4).  \n \n#Figure 4 approximately here# \n \nMean and minimum ambient temperatures for the 24 hours during which DEE was measured did \nnot differ between Bute Park and Monks Wood (park: mean \u00b1 SD = 14.4 \u00b1 1.7 oC, minimum = 11.6 \n\u00b1 1.7 oC, n = 22; wood: mean = 15.1 \u00b1 1.9 oC, minimum = 11.7 \u00b1 2.1 oC, n = 23. Mean: t43 = -1.26, \nP = 0.213; minimum: t43 = -0.21, P = 0.837).  \n \nDiscussion \n   \nIn the park, the reproductive success of great tits was reduced compared with the wood, and yet \nfemale energy expenditure was higher, despite the smaller brood sizes. Thus great tits in the park \nworked harder for less return. We did not measure food abundance directly (the high tree species \ndiversity in parkland makes frass trapping ineffective [Zandt 1994]), but the increase above average \nDEE in birds whose territories had more than about 35% gap indicated that the availability of trees \nper se had a direct effect on the costs of rearing young. Work on great tits in the Netherlands \n(Verhulst and Tinbergen 1997; Tinbergen and Verhulst 2000) has suggested that adults feeding \nyoung are constrained by time, rather than by intrinsic (e.g. phylogenic or physiological) limits to \nenergy expenditure, due to a shortage of daylight for foraging. Our results for the park birds are \nconsistent with this because, despite their higher work rate compared with Monks Wood birds, their \nDEE was similar or slightly less than values reported for great tits in various woodland sites in the \nNetherlands (Tinbergen and Dietz 1994; Tinbergen and Verhulst 2000) and were not excessive in \nterms of average (Daan et al 1990; Bryant and Tatner 1991) or maximal suggested limits for \nsustainable energy expenditure (Lindstr\u00f6m and Kvist 1995; Hammond and Diamond 1997). \n                                                                                                       12 \n \nTinbergen and Verhulst (2000) also suggested that ambient temperature might impose an extrinsic \nlimit to energy expenditure (an \u201cenergetic ceiling\u201d), but temperatures during the measurement of \nDEE did not differ between Bute Park and Monks Wood.  \nThe results for the blue tit indicated by the arrows in Figure 3 were omitted from the calculations \nof the fitted lines because the value of DEE for this bird was low compared to the rest of the data \nset. In a study of marsh tits (Poecile palustris), Nilsson (2002) found that six out of 12 females took \n4-10 h to resume feeding their young after the initial procedures of the DLW method and that this \nreduced their DEE by an average of 46% compared with the others which resumed within one hour. \nAlthough such adverse reactions are unusual (Speakman 1997), it is possible that the park blue tit \nwas slow to resume normal feeding behaviour resulting in the low value. Results for great tits and \nblue tits in the park were combined by expressing DEE as the deviation from the mean because the \nbreeding ecology of both species is well known to be particularly dependent on the spring \nabundance of tree-dwelling caterpillars (e.g. van Balen 1973; Perrins 1979; Perrins 1991). The use \nof alternative food supplies by either species would tend to obscure relationships with tree canopy \nheight and gaps and the data for the two species showed no sign of segregation by species across the \nrelationships (Fig. 3). \nIn Monks Wood, the relationships between both DEE and the percentage deviation from the \nmean for the year and the availability of oak around the nest box were analogous to that between the \npercentage deviation and amount of gap in Bute Park (Figs. 2 & 3). In the wood, birds with less oak \naround their boxes worked harder than average, while in the park, birds with fewer trees worked \nharder. In the park, English oak was rare within 30 m of any experimental box and thus the prime \nproblem for the park birds appeared to concern quantity, rather than quality, of trees. Obviously, the \nnon-oak species in Monks Wood do provide the birds with foraging opportunities, but the \nrelationship with oak highlights its importance as a source of caterpillars as found in other studies \n(e.g. Perrins 1991; Fischbacher et al 1998; Naef-Daenzer et al 2004) and suggests that functional \ngap effects may commonly influence bird foraging behaviour. Tinbergen and Verhulst (2000) found \n                                                                                                       13 \n \nan unusually high DEE for one female great tit which spent much of her time flying to a relatively \ndistant oak with a high density of small caterpillars. Thus, the two females in Monks Wood with \nlittle oak canopy within 30 m and high DEEs in 2003 may have been travelling further than average \nto find oak trees. Other work has also shown that functional gap effects may operate at a landscape \nscale due to a heterogeneous distribution of forest patch sizes and tree species composition (e.g. \nLambrechts et al 2004). \nThe difference between the years in Figure 4 suggested that the importance of oak to territory \nquality may differ between years (L\u00f5hmus 2003; Hinsley et al 2006). In blue tits breeding in \nsuburban gardens, the amount of oak and rowan (Sorbus acuparia) within 25 m of the nest \nexplained 21% of the variation in fledging success in one out of three years (Cowie and Hinsley \n1987). In this one year, but not the other two, the time of peak chick demand (age 10-11 days, \nPerrins 1991) coincided with days of heavy rain.  \nThomas et al. (2001) reported that a mismatch between the timing of breeding and peak \ncaterpillar abundance could double the cost of rearing young in blue tits breeding in evergreen holm \noak (Quercus ilex) forest in southern France (but also see Verhulst and Tinbergen 2001). For the \nmost badly timed birds, DEE was in the region of 120-130 kJ day-1, which raises the question of \nwhy the Bute Park birds did not work harder, if such work rates are possible? If the evergreen oak \nhabitat was more continuous than that of the park, then possibly the park tits were more constrained \nby the time taken to cross, or avoid, gaps than the additional energy expenditure. In a study of blue \ntits on Corsica (Tremblay et al 2005), birds at a site with low caterpillar abundance, had average \nforaging distances from the nest of more than twice that of birds where caterpillar abundance was \nhigh (53 m versus 25 m). However, total flight distances per hour were similar because the birds in \npoor habitat made longer, but fewer, trips and fed their young a similar total biomass of caterpillars \ncomprising fewer, larger prey. Tremblay et al. (2005) suggested that foraging costs, although not \nmeasured directly, would therefore be similar in both habitats because the costs of longer, but \nfewer, foraging trips would be offset by lower costs whilst searching more selectively within \n                                                                                                       14 \n \nparticular trees for large prey, i.e. the costs of searching would be less than the costs of flight \n(Goldstein 1990; Hinsley 2000). This was in contrast to the shorter, but more frequent, foraging \ntrips and shorter search times of the birds in the good habitat. Similarly, starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) \nrearing experimentally enlarged broods, were able to maintain food delivery rates per chick without \nincreasing DEE by adjustments in foraging and social behaviour and prey selection (Wright et al \n1998). Thus parkland birds might be able to minimise overall DEE by adopting a selective, large \nprey, strategy.  \nA study of foraging distances in blue tits in Germany (Stuass et al 2005), again found shorter \nforaging distances in high quality habitat (deciduous woodland, 22 m) compared with low quality \nhabitat (mixed woodland, 40 m). Prey size was not measured, but unlike the Corsican birds, feeding \nrates did not differ between the two habitats, suggesting that parental costs in the poor habitat \nshould have been greater. In both Corsica and Germany, clutch and brood sizes were smaller in the \npoor habitats, whereas chick body mass was also lower in Corsica, but not in Germany. The lower \nbody mass in poor habitat in Corsica was thought to be due to infestation of the young by blow-fly \nlarvae (Protocalliphora spp.) because the total amount of prey delivered was the same as in the high \nquality habitat. In Bute Park, blue tits reared fewer young than in Monks Wood, but chick body \nmass did not differ. In contrast, great tits in the park reared both fewer and lighter young. Juvenile \nsurvival and recruitment into the breeding population is positively correlated with fledging mass \n(Tinbergen and Boerlijst 1990; Lind\u00e9n et al 1992); thus blue tits appeared to cope better in the park \nthan great tits, as has been found for these two species in other secondary habitats such as suburban \ngardens (Cowie and Hinsley 1987) and small woods (Hinsley et al 1999). Blue tits are smaller than \ngreat tits (c. 10 g versus 18 g) and feed their young proportionately smaller prey items. Therefore, \nthey may have an advantage over great tits in the application of a foraging strategy involving the \nselection of larger prey and fewer nest visits.  \nHabitat gaps, both structural and functional, can increase the costs of rearing young, and may \nalso reduce breeding success. Given these effects on parental DEE of gaps in the park and of oak \n                                                                                                       15 \n \ntrees in the wood, it is clear that habitat quality for breeding tits, and other arboreal insectivores, \ncould be improved. In parks and other secondary habitats, and especially where space to increase \ntotal habitat area is limited, this could be done by increasing the proportion of native tree species. In \nwoodland, increasing the proportion of oak, and other tree species with rich invertebrate faunas, is \none possibility, but would have to be balanced against additional requirements of both the birds and \nother taxa.  \n \nAcknowledgements  We would like to thank the Esm\u00e9e Fairbairn Foundation for funding the DLW \nprocedure.

Ferns \n \nSupplementary Material \n \nMeasurement of bird energy expenditure using doubly labeled water (DLW) \n \nWe measured the daily energy expenditure (DEE, kJ day-1) using the doubly labelled \nwater (DLW) technique (Lifson and McClintock 1966; Speakman 1998). This method \nhas been previously validated by comparison to indirect calorimetry in a range of \nsmall birds (Visser and Shekkermann 1999) and provides an accurate measure of \ndaily energy expenditure over periods of several days (Speakman et al. 1994; \nBerteaux et al. 1996).  \n All the nest boxes were equipped with an internal trap door allowing the operator \nto trap the individual bird required. Once caught, the bird was ringed, or the ring \nnumber recorded if already present, sexed, aged as a first year or older using plumage \ncharacteristics (Svensson 1992) and the length (maximum chord) of one wing was \nmeasured. Body mass was measured to 0.01g using a portable top pan balance (Adam \nEquipment Co. Ltd., ACB 300) and the tip of the tail marked with a small amount of \nwhite correction fluid to facilitate identification when retrapping. The bird was then \ninjected intraperitoneally with approximately 0.1 ml DLW and placed in a cloth bag \nfor 30 minutes (Thomas et al 2001) to allow the injectate to equilibrate with the body \nwater. After equilibration, a blood sample, maximum volume 70 \u03bcl for great tits and \n40 \u03bcl for blue tits, was collected from the brachial vein in one wing using non-\n 1\nheparinized capillary tubes (Hirschmann 100 \u03bcl ringcaps), and the bird returned to the \nbag for a few minutes to ensure that all bleeding had stopped. The tubes were \nimmediately flamed-sealed using a portable butane gas burner (RS Components Ltd., \nmini gas torch) and stored in larger, screw-topped glass tubes. The condition of the \nbird was checked and it was then released in the nest box to continue feeding the \nyoung. The whole procedure from capture to release took about one hour. The bird \nwas retrapped as near to 24 hours later as possible (Speakman and Racey 1988) and a \nsecond blood sample collected from the brachial vein in the other wing before again \nreleasing it in the box. The measurement procedures were carried out at a distance \nfrom the box to allow the untrapped partner to continue feeding the young. Most \nnestlings were 11 days old on the first day of capture and thus they were ringed and \nindividually weighed during the equilibration period, reducing disturbance at the nest.  \nThe syringes (1 ml disposable, 0.3 x 13 mm needle) of DLW were prepared \nimmediately prior to going into the field or occasionally the night before, but no \nlonger than 15-18 hours before use. They were filled and weighed to 0.0001g in the \nlab using an analytical balance and the exact volume of DLW injected calculated by \nsubtraction after reweighing the syringes on the same balance within a few hours of \nuse. An additional syringe was carried with those used and was weighed before and \nafter each field session to monitor possible evaporative losses, but these were \nnegligible. Blood samples were also collected from non-experimental birds at both \nsites in all years (minimum six birds per species per site per year as appropriate) to \ndetermine background levels of 18O and 2H (Speakman and Racey 1987: method C). \nAll blood samples were stored at 4\u00baC until analysis. \nThe blood samples were vacuum distilled into glass Pasteur pipettes (Nagy 1983) \nand the water obtained used for isotope-ratio mass spectrometric analysis of 2H and \n 2\n18O. The 2H analysis was performed on hydrogen (H2) gas, produced by on-line \nchromium reduction of water (Morrison et al 2001). For analysis of 18O enrichment in \nblood samples, water distilled from blood was equilibrated with carbon dioxide (CO2) \ngas using the small sample equilibration technique (Speakman et al 1990).  \nFor estimation of the injectate enrichment, the original injectate was diluted with \ntap water (five different solutions, \u00b1 0.0001 g), in proportions similar to those \nexpected in the injected birds. Mass spectrometric analysis of  2H and 18O was \nperformed on five sub-samples of each solution and five sub-samples of tap water. \nThe enrichment of the injectate was calculated for the five different solutions \n(Prentice 1990, Speakman 1997), and then averaged. Isotopically characterized gases \nof H2 and CO2 (CP grade gases BOC Ltd) were used in the reference channels of the \nisotope ratio mass spectrometers. Reference gases were characterized every three \nmonths relative to SMOW and SLAP (Craig 1961) supplied by the International \nAtomic Energy Agency. Each batch of samples was run adjacent to triplicates of three \nlaboratory standards to correct for day-to-day differences in mass spectrometer \nperformance. All isotope enrichments were measured in \u03b4 per ml relative to the \nworking standards and converted to ppm, using the established ratios for these \nreference materials. The measures of isotope enrichment in blood samples were based \non analysis of five sub-samples (2H) or two sub-samples (18O); all subsequent \ncalculations were performed on the mean values.    \nIsotope enrichment were converted to values of daily energy expenditure using a \nsingle pool model as recommended for this size of animal by Speakman (1993). There \nare several alternative approaches for the treatment of evaporative water loss in the \ncalculation (Visser and Schekkermann 1999). We chose the assumption of a fixed \nevaporation of 25% of the water flux (Speakman 1997: equation 7.17) which has been \n 3\nestablished to minimise error in a range of conditions (Visser and Schekkerman 1999; \nvan Tright et al. 2002). \n \nAnalysis of remote sensed data \n \nThe LiDAR data for Monks Wood and Bute Park were supplied as ACSII data sets of \nx-, y-, and z- co-ordinates (and intensity) for the first and last return of each laser \npulse. The x- and y- location of each scanned point was supplied in British National \nGrid co-ordinates, whilst the z- elevation was supplied in metres above the Ordnance \nSurvey of Great Britain 1936 Datum. For ease of data processing, the point cloud data \nsets were each interpolated into raster Digital Surface Models (DSMs). Separate \nDSMs were created for the first and last return elevation measurements of each data \nset. The selected pixel size was 1m for Monks Wood and 0.5 m for Bute Park; the \nhigher sampling density allowing for the interpolation of a finer spatial resolution \nDSM for the park. The last return DSMs had a higher proportion of ground hits than \nthe first return DSMs and so were used to model the underlying terrain. In both cases, \nmodelling of the terrain was based on local minimum filtering, extracting ground hits \nas local elevation minima, but varying the kernel size depending on canopy \nheterogeneity and openness. As a more open site, smaller kernel sizes were used at \nBute Park than at Monks Wood. Terrain modelling was an iterative process involving \nmanual editing and the retention of a higher proportion of last return data per \niteration, resulting in the interpolation of increasingly detailed terrain surfaces. A thin-\nplate spline interpolation was used to render a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) from the \nfinal set of extracted ground hits per site. By the per-pixel subtraction of the DTM \nfrom the first return DSM, and the removal of buildings within digitised areas of \n 4\ninterest, a Digital Canopy Height Model (DCHM) was created for each site in which \ncanopy height was expressed in metres above the ground. Further details of the \nLiDAR processing method as applied to Monks Wood are available in Hill and \nThomson (2005), whilst accuracy assessment of the DTM and DCHM for Monks \nWood are available in Gaveau and Hill (2003) and Patenaude et al.
