A small\nminority have severe reflux and, despite full medical\ntreatment, have complications or persistent symptoms\nrequiring surgical intervention. For the remainder,\ncontrol of symptoms requires regular or intermittent\nmedical treatment, usually with proton pump inhibi-\ntors, and it is from this intermediate group that most of\nthe treatment costs arise.While there iswideagreement\nthat proton pump inhibitors, sometimes combined\nwith prokinetic agents, are themost effective treatment\nfor moderate to severe GORD, they can cause a\nspectrum of short term symptoms,2 and there are\nconcerns about the impact of long term use through\nprofound acid suppression.3\nInterest in surgery as an alternative to long term\nmedical treatment has been considerable since the\nintroduction of the minimal access laparoscopic\napproach in the early 1990s. The operation (fundopli-\ncation) involves partial or total wrapping of the fundus\nof the stomach around the lower oesophagus to\nrecreate a highpressure zone.Although fundoplication\nproduces resolutionof reflux symptoms inup to90%of\npatients,4 we do not know whether exchanging\nsymptoms associated with best medical management\nfor those of the side effects of surgery is advantageous\nfor the patient and a good use of healthcare resources.\nWe carried out a multicentre pragmatic randomised\ntrial (with parallel non-randomised preference groups\nto contextualise the results and augment them,\nparticularly in respect of surgical complications),5\nevaluating the clinical effectiveness, safety, and costs\nof a policy of relatively early laparoscopic surgery\n1Health Services Research Unit,\nHealth Sciences Building,\nUniversity of Aberdeen,\nForesterhill, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD\n2Aberdeen Royal Infirmary,\nForesterhill, Aberdeen AB25 1LD\n3Department of Gastroenterology,\nRoyal Infirmary, Glasgow G4 0SF\n4Faculty of Medicine, Imperial\nCollege, St Mary\u2019s Campus,\nLondon W2 1PG\nCorrespondence to: A M Grant\na.grant@abdn.ac.uk\nCite this as: BMJ 2008;337:a2664\ndoi:10.1136\/bmj.a2664\nBMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com page 1 of 8\n on 24 February 2009 bmj.comDownloaded from \ncompared with optimised medical management of\nGORD for people judged suitable for both policies.\nMETHODS\nParticipants\nPatients were eligible if they hadmore than 12months\u2019\nsymptoms requiring maintenance treatment with a\nproton pump inhibitor (or alternative) for reasonable\ncontrol; they had endoscopic or 24 hour pH monitor-\ning evidence of GORD, or both; they were suitable for\neither policy (including American Society of Anesthe-\nsiologists (ASA) grade I or II); and the recruitingdoctor\nwas uncertain which management policy to follow.\nExclusion criteria were morbid obesity (BMI >40);\nBarrett\u2019s oesophagus of more than 3 cm or with\nevidence of dysplasia; para-oesophageal hernia; and\noesophageal stricture.\nWe invited any eligible patient who did not want to\ntake part in the randomised trial because of a strong\npreference about treatment to join a non-randomised\npreference arm. An independent data monitoring\ncommittee recommended continued recruitment on\neach of the three occasions that it confidentially\nreviewed accumulating data.\nClinical management\nClinicalmanagement aimed to optimise current care in\nparticipating centres. Participating clinical centres had\nlocal partnerships between surgeons (who had per-\nformed at least 50 laparoscopic fundoplication opera-\ntions) and gastroenterologists with whom they shared\nthe secondary care of patients with GORD. They,\nsupported by local research nurses, informed partici-\npants about the randomised trial and invited them to\ntake part. It was only at this point that participants who\ndeclined to take part in the randomised trial, because of\na strong preference either for remaining on medical\ntreatment or for undergoing surgery, were informed\nabout, and given the opportunity to take part in, the\npreference study.\nFor all participants in either the randomised or\npreference surgical group, surgery could be subse-\nquently deferred or declined, by either the participant\nor surgeon (that is, even after trial entry). In the absence\nof erosive oesophagitis on endoscopy, and when\nnecessary to exclude achalasia, manometry or pH\nstudieswere performedbefore surgery. A lead surgeon\n(or a less experienced surgeon working under super-\nvision) undertook the surgery. Routine crural repair\nand non-absorbable synthetic sutures were recom-\nmended. The type of fundoplication was left to the\ndiscretion of the surgeon, who recorded intraoperative\ndetails on a specially designed study form. For the\npurposes of the main comparisons, we considered the\ndifferent fundoplication techniques as a single policy.\nThose allocated to medical treatment had their\ntreatment reviewed and adjusted as necessary by a\nlocal gastroenterologist to be \u201cbest medical manage-\nment,\u201d based on the Genval workshop report.6 The\nmedical protocol included the option of surgery if a\nclear indication developed after randomisation.

The primary outcomewas\nthe REFLUX questionnaire score, a validated \u201cdisease\nspecific\u201d measure incorporating assessment of reflux\nand other gastrointestinal symptoms and the side\neffects and complications of both treatments (score\nrange 0 to 100, the higher the score the better the\npatients felt).7 The scorewasderived from theweighted\naverage of six questions on quality of life (heartburn;\nacid reflux; eating and swallowing; bowel movements;\nsleep; and work, physical, and social activities). Five\nsymptom scores were also developed as secondary\nmeasures (general discomfort; wind and frequency;\nnausea and vomiting; limitation in activity; constipa-\ntion and swallowing). Participants were followed up by\npostal questionnaire three and 12months after surgery\nor at an equivalent time among those who did not have\nsurgery; the medical participants were linked to\nsurgical participants who had been randomised at\nabout the same time. Issues related to long, variable\nlength, waiting lists prohibited timing of follow-up\nfrom randomisation. Other prestated outcome mea-\nsures were health status (EQ-5D, based on UK public\npreference values, and SF-36); serious morbidity, such\nas operative complications; and mortality.\nSample size\nWe originally intended to recruit 300 participants to\neach trial group to identify a difference between the\nrandomised groups of 0.25 of 1 SD in the disease\nspecific REFLUX score (80% power; \u03b1=0.05)\n12 months after surgery. In January 2003, however,\nin part prompted by a lower rate of recruitment than\nexpected,we revised this target in consultationwith the\ndata monitoring committee and representatives of the\nfunders. It was agreed that a slightly larger but still\nmoderate sizedbenefit (0.3 of 1 SD, equivalent to seven\npoints on the REFLUX quality of life score) was\nclinically plausiblebasedon improvements reported in\nother studies8 9 after surgery among more severely\naffected people.We calculated that this required 196 in\neach group to give 80% power (\u03b1=0.05), assuming 10%\nattrition (that is, 176 per group with 12 month follow-\nup).\nRandomisation\nRandomallocationwas organised centrally by a secure\nsystem, using a computer generated sequence, strati-\nfiedbyclinical site,withbalance in respect of age (18-49\nor \u226550), sex (men or women), and BMI (\u226428 or >29)\nsecured byminimisation. Staff in the central trial office\nentered details of participants on the secure database,\nthennotifiedparticipants and respective clinical sites of\ntheir allocation. There was no subsequent blinding.\nThe figure summarises the stages of the trial. The first\n146 randomised participants (70 allocated to surgery\nand 76 allocated to medical management) were sent\ndetails of their allocation at the same time as the\nbaseline questionnaires. This was changed at the\nrequest of the data monitoring committee such that\nsubsequent allocations were generated only once\ncompleted baseline forms had been returned. The\ncommittee were concerned that if patients were to\nreceive their allocation before completing the ques-\ntionnaire this could potentially affect their responses.\nStatistical methods\nOur primary analysis in the randomised trial was by\nintention to treat. General linear models adjusted for\nthe minimisation covariates (age, BMI, and sex) and,\nwhen appropriate, for baseline score and interaction\nbetween baseline score and treatment. We also\nincluded a covariate to adjust for the change in practice\nregarding the baseline questionnaires. All analyses\nused 95% confidence intervals. Because a relatively\nlarge proportion of the randomised surgical partici-\npants did not receive surgery, we also performed per\nprotocol analyses and analyses adjusted for treatment\nreceived1011 to estimate efficacy of treatment. For the\npreference groups, we analysed statistically only the\nprimary outcome, the REFLUX score. This analysis\ncompared the group who preferred surgery with the\ngroup who preferred medical treatment and adjusted\nfor the minimisation factors. We did not plan to adjust\nTable 1 | Description of groups at trial entry.

All deaths were unrelated to trial\nparticipation.\nDescription of the groups at trial entry\nThe characteristics of the randomised participants\n(table 1, baseline rates for medication in table 2, and\ntable A on bmj.com) were similar and lay between\nthose in the preference groups; participants in the\npreference for surgery group were younger and had\nbeen prescribed medication for GORD for longer;\nparticipants in the preference for medical treatment\ngroup were older, more likely to be women, and had\nbeen prescribed medication for a shorter time.\nSurgical management\nIn total, 111 (62%) of those randomised to surgery and\n218 (84%) participants in the preference for surgery\ngroup actually received fundoplication (table 3). The\nmost common clinical reasons for not having surgery\nwere a surgeon\u2019s decision that symptoms were not\nsufficiently severe or that a patient was not fit for\nsurgery (such as being overweight). Themost common\npersonal reasonswere participants\u2019 change ofmind for\nwork or home related reasons, concerns about surgery,\na wish to avoid preoperative tests, and improved\nsymptoms.\nTable 3 shows details of the surgery. Two (1%) of the\n329 participants who had surgery had conversions to\nan open procedure (95% confidence interval 0.2% to\n2.2%), and eight (2%) had a visceral injury (1.2% to\n4.7%). Most of those who had fundoplication were\ndischarged homewithin twodays.

By 12 months after surgery,\n38% (59\/154) of the randomised surgical participants\nwere takingmedication compared with 90% (147\/164)\nof the randomised medical participants (nearly all of\nwhom were taking proton pump inhibitors). Among\nthose who had surgery, use of antireflux medication\ndropped to 9% at three months and 14% (14\/104) at\n12months after surgery. Improvements in the scores in\nthe medical group might reflect changes in manage-\nment; lansoprazolewas the predominant proton pump\ninhibitor used at study entry, whereas at follow-up\nomeprazole and lansoprazole were the most com-\nmonly reported.\nHealth status\nTable 4 showsREFLUXscores at baseline and at three\nand 12 months (see also tables B and C on bmj.com).\nThere were substantial differences between the rando-\nmised intention to treat groups in theREFLUXscore (a\nthird to a half of 1 SD at follow up), with the surgery\ngroup having better scores than the medical group.\nThis reflected improvements across all symptom\ndomains within the measure (see tables B, C, and D on\nbmj.com). The differences between groups were larger\nwhenwe considered only the per protocol participants.\nStatistical analyses for the primary outcome\n(REFLUX score 12 months after surgery) showed\nstrong evidence of increases in scores favouring\nsurgery (table 5). Both the per protocol analyses and\nanalyses adjusted for treatment received (providing\nestimates of treatment efficacy) suggested larger\ndifferences between the randomised groups. For the\nintention to treat analysis, the mean difference in\nfavour of surgery was 11.2 between the groups with\nadjustment for only theminimisation variables (model\nI) and this increased to 14.1 when we included the\nbaseline score (model II). Therewas strong evidence of\nan interaction effect between randomised group and\nbaseline REFLUX score (interaction term: \u22120.35,\n\u22120.53 to \u22120.17; P<0.001). This implied that as baseline\nREFLUX score decreased (baseline symptoms were\nmore severe) the treatment effect of surgery increased.\nFor example, estimating the treatment difference at\nbaselinemeanREFLUXscore of 65.4 resulted in a trial\neffect size of 14.0 (9.6 to 18.4; P<0.001; model III, the\nmost parsimoniousmodel). If the average patient had a\nlower mean REFLUX score at baseline of 56.0, the\neffect size increased to 17.2 (12.6 to 21.9). If the patient\nhad a higher baseline score of 78.0, the treatment effect\ndecreased to 9.5 (4.5 to 14.5).\nSimilar patterns in the randomised groupswere seen\nin the SF-36 scores, where the biggest differences\nfavouring surgery were observed in the general health\nand bodily pain dimensions and in the EQ-5D score\n(see tables B, C, and D on bmj.com), although with\nsome evidence of attenuation at 12 months. Three\nparticipantsdied, one in the randomisedmedical group\n(road traffic incident) and two in thepreference surgical\ngroup, neither of whom had surgery (alcoholic liver\ndisease and cause unknown).\nPossible side effects of surgery\nNo differences were detected between the trial groups\nin their questionnaire responses at 12 months regard-\ning \u201cdifficulty swallowing\u201d and \u201cbloatedness\/trapped\nwind,\u201d but there was some evidence of more frequent\n\u201cwind from the lower bowel\u201d after surgery.\nPreference groups\nThe participants in the preference for surgery group\nhad lowermeanREFLUXscores at baseline than those\nin the preference for medical treatment group (55.8 v\n77.5). Despite this, at follow-up at 12 months, accord-\ning to intention to treat analysis (difference 3.9, \u22120.2 to\n8.0; P=0.064) andperprotocol analysis (6.3, 2.4 to10.2;\nP=0.002) the REFLUX score favoured the preference\nsurgical group.\nFor participants in the preference group, other\nquality of life scores also tended to favour the surgical\ngroup. The differences between the preference groups,\nhowever, were less marked than the differences\nbetween the randomised groups, mainly because the\npreference for medical treatment group had better\nscores than the randomised medical group at baseline\nand follow-up.\nDISCUSSION\nPrincipal findings\nIn patients with GORD, laparoscopic fundoplication\nresults in better symptom relief and improved quality\nTable 4 | Health status at baseline and at three and 12 months after surgery.

The lower the REFLUX scores at\nentry\u2014that is, the worse the symptoms\u2014the larger\nwere the improvements after surgery. Similar differ-\nenceswere seen inmost of the othermeasures of health\nstatus. There was, however, some evidence of a\nnarrowing of the differences between three and\n12 months, particularly for the EQ-5D. Data on drug\ntreatment were consistent with this, showing more use\nin the surgical groups at 12 months than at three\nmonths. There were small improvements in scores in\nthe medical groups; this might reflect their having\nspecialist review at trial entry to optimise their drug\ntreatment.\nThose who agreed to join the randomised trial had\nbaseline characteristics between the two preference\ngroups. The results in the preference groups were\nconsistent with the randomised comparison: scores\nafter surgery in those who preferred surgery were\nsomewhat higher than in those who preferred medical\ntreatment, despite starting from much lower baseline\nlevels. None of the three participants who died had\nsurgery and complications were uncommon; but\nconfidence intervals around estimated frequencies\nwere wide despite inclusion of all 319 surgical\nparticipants, leaving important uncertainty about the\nmagnitude of surgical risk.\nStrengths and weaknesses\nWe used a pragmatic trial design, with many UK\npatients, centres and experienced surgeons, thus\nallowing the results to be interpreted within a \u201creal\nlife\u201d NHS context. The addition of the preference\ngroups gives an indication of probable behaviour if\nsurgery were to become more freely available.\nWe explored the impact of a third of those\nrandomised to surgery not having fundoplication:\nfirstly, through per protocol analyses limited to those\nrandomisedwhoreceived their allocatedmanagement,\nand, secondly, through an adjusted approach1011 in an\nattempt to circumvent the probable selection bias of\nper protocol analyses. In the event, these two\napproaches gave similar results.Thedirectionof effects\nwas so clear that we observed significant differences\neven in the most conservative intention to treat\nanalyses.While the intention to treat analyses estimate\nunbiased average effects on compliers and non-\ncompliers, the adjusted analyses estimate bias adjusted\naverage treatment effects on those who comply with\ntreatment. In general, an adjusted analysis is preferable\nto a per protocol analysis as it is less likely to be biased.\nThe protocol allowed surgeons to use the type of\nfundoplication with which they were familiar, princi-\npally to avoid any learning effects. There is mixed\nevidence for the use of a total wrap or partial wrap.12\nWe explored possible differential effects of total versus\npartial wrap fundoplication in an observational analy-\nsis and found no evidence of a difference within either\nthe randomised, preference, or per protocol groups\n(difference in 12 month REFLUX score \u22121.3 (\u22127.9 to\n5.2), P=0.687).\nOur study was limited to patients who were on long\nterm acid suppression with proton pump inhibitors,\nwho had symptoms that were reasonably controlled,\nandwhowere clinically suitable for either policy; it is to\nthese sorts of patients with GORD that the results are\ngeneralisable. Potential participants were not easy to\nidentify and recruit, and this led to slow recruitment.\nMost patients taking long term proton pump inhibitor\ntreatment are managed in general practice, often\nthrough a repeat prescription system, whereas our\ntrial was based in secondary care. We used three\napproaches to identify potentially eligible patients:\nretrospective reviewof hospital case notes; prospective\nidentification, especially through endoscopy clinics;\nand (in selected centres) public advertisements. All\npotentially eligible patients then had to be assessed\nclinically, often through specially established monthly\nclinics, before being formally approached about the\ntrial. Those approached often expressed clear prefer-\nences, reflecting the marked differences between the\npolicies being compared.\nThe trial was conducted at a time when there was\ngreat pressure on surgical services in the NHS, with\nlong delays for elective surgery for non-life threatening\nbenign conditions. Indeed, the average time between\ntrial entry and surgery was eight to nine months. Some\nparticipants experienced long delays before being\nformally offered surgery, and this was an important\nfactor in their eventual decision to choose not to have\nsurgery after all. While patient\u2019s choice was the\ncommonest reason for not having surgery, about a\nthird of those who did not have fundoplication after\nallocation to surgery were refused surgery for clinical\nTable 5 | Difference* (95% confidence interval) in REFLUX quality of life score\u2020 at 12 months after surgery in randomised\nparticipants\nModel Intention to treat Per protocol Adjusted for treatment received\nI: adjusted for minimisation variables 11.2 (6.4 to 16.0) 15.4 (10.0 to 20.9) 16.7 (9.7 to 23.6)\nII: adjusted for minimisation variables and baseline\nREFLUX QoL score\n14.1 (9.6 to18.6) 19.1 (14.0 to 24.1) 20.3 (13.8 to 26.8)\nIII: adjusted for minimisation variables, baseline score, and\ninteraction between treatment and baseline REFLUX QoL score\n14.0 (9.6 to18.4) 18.4 (13.6 to 23.2) 19.4 (13.0 to 25.8)\n*Surgery group minus medical group, all P<0.001.\n\u2020Higher scores mean patient felt better (range 0-100).\nRESEARCH\npage 6 of 8 BMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com\n on 24 February 2009 bmj.comDownloaded from \nreasons: most commonly, the surgeon disagreed with\nthe recruiting doctor that symptoms were sufficient to\njustify surgery or judged that the patient was not\nsufficiently fit (such as overweight) or the symptoms\nhad improved since randomisation,\nThe standard rule in most trials is to time follow-up\nfrom randomisation. This was not appropriate in our\ntrial because of the variable time between randomisa-\ntion and surgery, exacerbated by the waiting list\nproblem. The protocol specified follow-up at a time\nequivalent to three and 12months after surgery. It was\nimportant tohave follow-up in themedical groups at an\nequivalent time.Wearranged this by setting the follow-\nup of medical participants at time points equivalent to\nthree months and 12 months after surgery.\nWe focused directly on subjective measures of\noutcome (patient reported measures) rather than on\nobjective measures of outcome. This was intentional\nand appropriate for the pragmatic evaluation of the\ninterventions. In clinical practice, pH is not routinely\nmeasured after surgery. If we had included such\nobjective outcome measures, this would have entailed\nour changing the regular management practices for\nthese patients, thus jeopardising the generalisability of\nboth our intervention and our findings.\nComparison with other studies\nWe identified two other randomised trials comparing\nlaparoscopic Nissen fundoplication with continued\nmedical management.13 14 They were less pragmatic in\ndesign with fewer participants (21713 and 10414),\ncentres (two13 and one14), and surgeons (two13 and\nfour14) and reported postoperative 24 hour pH\nmeasurement. The results of the two trials were\nconsistent with ours. Across all trials, there were\nsignificantly greater improvements after surgery in\nmeasures of gastrointestinal and general wellbeing.\nWhile no major intraoperative complications were\nreported among the 52 patientswhohad surgery in one\ntrial,14 in the other trial there were four major\ncomplications and four reoperations, including one\ncase of gastric resection, among the 109 patients who\nhad fundoplication,13 illustrating the potential risks of\nthe procedure.\nConclusions\nLaparoscopic fundoplication significantly increased\nhealth status at least to12months after surgery. Surgery\ndoes carry costs, however, and we will report\ninvestigation of cost effectiveness elsewhere. The\nnarrowing of differences in health status between\nthree and 12 months could reflect a postoperative\nplacebo effect or could indicate decreasing effective-\nness of surgery over time from surgery (as has been\nobserved after open fundoplication9).
