Introduction\nVolume-Phase Holographic (VPH) gratings potentially have many advantages over classical\nsurface-relief gratings ([1]; [2]). They are already in operation in some existing astronomical\nspectrographs and their use is also planned for a number of forthcoming instruments (e.g., [7]).\nIn applications to spectrographs for extremely large telescopes, one has to consider that the\nbeam diameter in a spectrograph will become very large (\u223c 30 cm or even larger) to obtain\na reasonably high resolving power and consequently large optics and dispersing elements will\nbe demanded. In this respect, VPH gratings may have an advantage. Unlike classical surface\nrelief gratings, VPH gratings with such large formats can be rather easily fabricated at a rea-\nsonable cost. However, the optical uniformity across the aperture has rarely been investigated,\ndespite the fact that during certain stages of fabrication, there is a significant risk of introducing\nspatial variation. In particular, the uniformity of diffraction efficiency and angular dispersion,\nthe key to the performance of a spectrograph, should be confirmed by experiments. We note\nthat throughput measurements at the two positions (centre and corner) of a VPH grating with\nthe size of 16 cm \u00d7 20 cm and the line density of 1520 lines\/mm are presented ([6]) but the\ngrating was made before the manufacturer\u2019s fabrication process was improved and it shows a\nlarge difference in diffraction efficiency between the centre and corner of the grating.\nIn this paper, results from measurements of throughput and angular dispersion of a large\nformat grating are presented. A picture of the grating is shown in Fig. 1. This grating was\nmanufactured by Ralcon Development Lab for the FMOS project (e.g., [4]) with a diameter of\n\u223c 25 cm. The line density is 385 lines\/mm and thus the peak of diffraction efficiency is around\n1.3 \u00b5m at the Bragg condition when the incident angle of an input beam to the normal of the\ngrating surface is 15\u25e6. The measurements are performed at wavelengths between 0.9 \u00b5m and 1.6\n\u00b5m. In the next section, we will describe the test facility and the measurement procedures. Note\nthat the grating investigated here has the same specification as that used for the cryogenic tests\n([8]), but this element has not previously been exposed to vacuum or cryogenic temperature.\n2. The test set-up and measurements\nIn Fig. 2, the overall configuration of the optical components used for the measurements is\nindicated (detailed information for the main components is given in Table 1). Light exiting from\nthe monochromator is collimated and used as an input beam to illuminate the VPH grating. The\nspectral band-width of this input beam is set by adjusting the width of the output slit of the\nmonochromator. The slit width and the corresponding spectral band-width were set to 0.5 mm\nTable 1.

Schematic view of the test optics configuration.\nand \u223c 0.01 \u00b5m, respectively, throughout the measurements; the beam diameter was set to \u223c 2\ncm by using an iris at the exit of the lamp house.\nThe input beam is diffracted by the grating, and the camera section consisting of lenses and\na near-infrared detector (320 \u00d7 256 InGaAs array) is scanned to capture the diffracted beam.\nThe output slit of the monochromator is thus re-imaged on the detector. Since the detector\nexhibits some sensitivity at visible wavelengths, a visible blocking filter which is transparent at\nwavelengths longer than 0.75 \u00b5m is inserted after the monochromator to reduce contamination\nof visible light from higher orders.\nThe basic measurement procedures are as follows: First, the brightness of the lamp and the\nwavelength of light exiting from the monochromator are fixed (the brightness of the lamp is kept\nFig. 3. Schematic view of the sampled positions on the VPH grating (referred to as \u201cL\u201d, \u201cC\u201d,\nand \u201cR\u201d). The region near the edge indicated in grey is occupied by the support structure\nof the grating mount and is not optically accessible.\nconstant by a stabilized power supply during the measurement cycle at a given wavelength), and\nthe total intensity included in the image of the slit is measured without the VPH grating. Then,\nthe VPH grating is inserted at an angle to the optical axis, and the intensities of the zero and\nfirst order (+1) diffracted light are measured. The diffraction angle is also recorded. Next, the\ngrating is set at a different incident angle and the intensities of the diffracted light and diffraction\nangles are measured again. After these measurements are repeated for all the incident angles of\ninterest, a different wavelength is chosen and the same sequence is repeated. The brightness of\nthe lamp can be changed when moving from one wavelength to another: a higher brightness is\nused at shorter wavelengths because the system throughput is lower. After all the incident angles\nand wavelengths are scanned, the grating position is moved and fixed on the rotation stage so\nthat a different position of the grating aperture is illuminated. We sampled three positions as\nshown in Fig. 3 (labelled as \u201cL\u201d, \u201cC\u201d, and \u201cR\u201d). Since each position of the grating illuminated\nis mechanically located at the centre of the rotation stage, any aiming errors of illumination\nangles to the grating are expected to be equally small at all the measured positions.\n3. Results and discussions\nIn Fig. 4, 5, and 6, diffraction efficiency measured at the three positions is plotted against wave-\nlength for incident angles of 12.5\u25e6, 15.0\u25e6, and 17.5\u25e6, respectively. Random errors are dominated\nby fluctuations of the bias level of the detector on short timescales (\u223c 0.1\u22121 sec) and the error\nbars are calculated from a typical value of these fluctuations (for clarity error bars are shown\nonly for the data at the position \u201cC\u201d). The measurements suggest that, independently of incident\nangle, the throughputs at the position \u201cL\u201d tend to be at variance with the others; the difference\nin throughput can be \u223c 10 %. The differences are seen in the measurements both of the zero\nand first order diffractions in a mutually compensating manner; when the throughput of the first\norder diffraction is lower, that of the zero order is higher, and vice versa. Also, on the whole,\nthe peak of the throughput appears to shift towards shorter wavelengths (this is clearest at an\nincident angle of 12.5\u25e6). These suggest that the differences originate in the diffraction process,\nand are not due primarily to some additional absorption or reflection at that position.\nMeasurements of diffraction angles are given in Fig. 7. The difference of diffraction angle\nFig. 4. Diffraction efficiency measured for an incident angle of 12.5\u25e6. Throughputs meas-\nured at the centre are shown by solid circles (and solid line), and those at the other two\npositions are indicated by open triangle (and dashed line) and open square (and dotted\nline). The upper three lines are for the m = +1 order diffracted light and the lower ones are\nfor the 0th order light.\nfrom that predicted for a line density of 385 lines\/mm (the nominal line density of the VPH\ngrating) and for an incident angle of 40\u25e6 is plotted against wavelength. The predicted relation-\nship for line density of 375, 380, and 390 lines\/mm is also shown for comparison. The data\npoints show the actual measurements at the three positions. The error is typically\u223c0.4\u25e6, which\nis estimated from a comparison of the diffraction angles measured at the position \u201cC\u201d with\nthose measured mechanically afterwards for the same incident angle (see [8]). Again, for clar-\nity, the error bars are shown only for the data points at the position \u201cC\u201d. A large incident angle\nwas chosen for this test because the greater the incident angle is, the more sensitive are the\nresults to changes in line density. While the data points show some scatter around the predicted\nrelationships, this plot indicates that the diffraction angles measured at one position exhibit no\nclear discrepancy from the others and that the spectral dispersion is nearly independent of po-\nsition. The scatter of the data points in Fig. 7 is probably due to measurement errors and thus\nthe line density is likely to be rather uniform across the grating. Line density is normally well\ncontrolled in the manufacturing process, with a typical accuracy of \u223c 1 line\/mm over a grating\naperture. Nevertheless, it is worth treating the range between 375 lines\/mm and 385 lines\/mm,\nwhere the data points are scattered, as an upper limit for the variation of the line density in the\nfollowing analysis.\nNow we try to identify which parameters vary across the grating, by comparing the measured\ndiffraction efficiency with the predictions from coupled-wave analysis ([5]). In Fig. 8, 9, and\n10, the throughput curves measured at the positions \u201cC\u201d and \u201cL\u201d for incident angles of 12.5\u25e6,\n15.0\u25e6, and 17.5\u25e6 are plotted, respectively, in the same way as for Fig. 4, 5, and 6. Note that\nthe throughput curve measured at the position \u201cR\u201d is consistent with that at the position \u201cC\u201d\nand is therefore not shown here for clarity. Overplotted are three model predictions which are\ndescribed by grey smooth (solid and dashed) curves. Two grey solid lines show the predictions\nfor different line densities; 375 and 385 lines\/mm. In calculating these theoretical predictions,\na refractive index modulation amplitude of 0.05 and a dichromated gelatin depth of 12 \u00b5m\nare assumed. Also, 15% energy loss (presumed to be caused by a combination of internal ab-\nsorption and surface reflection) is assumed at all the wavelengths, to better fit the predictions\nto the measurements. It should be emphasized that these assumptions are used in calculating\nFig. 5. Same for Fig. 4, but for an incident angle of 15\u25e6.\nFig. 6. Same for Fig. 4, but for an incident angle of 17.5\u25e6.\nall the grey solid curves plotted in Fig. 8, 9, and 10. The energy lost by internal absorption in\nthe dichromated gelatin layer is estimated to be \u2264 1% below 1.8 \u00b5m (e.g., [1]) and those by\ncombined surface reflections at boundaries between glass and air are \u223c 10%. Our data may\ntherefore indicate a larger internal absorption. There may also be some energy loss due to sur-\nface reflections at boundaries between gelatin and glass, although this is expected to be very\nsmall because the refractive indices are similar.\nThe fact that the predictions for line densities of 375 and 385 lines\/mm lie close together\nindicates that even if the line density varies across the grating at this level (as suggested by\nFig. 7), the discrepancy of the throughput curve at the position \u201cL\u201d cannot be fully explained.\nOn the other hand, the grey dashed line, fitting better to the measurements at the position \u201cL\u201d,\nshows the model prediction where a dichromated gelatin depth of 11 \u00b5m is assumed, instead\nof 12 \u00b5m. Furthermore, 3% additional energy loss (hence 18% in total) is assumed. The re-\nfractive index modulation amplitude is the same as before (0.05) and the line density is 385\nlines\/mm. Nearly identical model predictions to those described with the grey lines in Fig. 8, 9\nand 10 can be obtained by adopting a refractive index modulation amplitude of 0.045 instead\nof changing the gelatin thickness. A combination of small variations in the gelatin thickness\nand\/or refractive index modulation amplitude, and the energy loss due to internal absorption\nFig. 7. Relationship between diffraction angle and wavelength. Difference of diffraction\nangle from that predicted for a line density of 385 lines\/mm (solid line; this is the speci-\nfication of the VPH grating) and an incident angle of 40\u25e6 are plotted against wavelength.\nThe symbols have the same meanings as in the previous figures. Dot-dashed, dashed, and\ndotted line shows the relationship expected for 375, 380, and 390 lines\/mm, respectively.\nFig. 8. The throughput curves measured at the positions \u201cC\u201d and \u201cL\u201d for an incident angle of\n12.5\u25e6 are plotted; these are the same as shown in Fig. 4. They are compared with predictions\nfrom coupled-wave analysis, which are indicated by grey smooth (solid and dashed) curves.\nGrey solid lines indicate the predictions for line densities of 375 and 385 lines\/mm. In these\ncalculations, a refractive index modulation amplitude of 0.05 and a dichromated gelatin\ndepth of 12 \u00b5m are assumed. 15% energy loss is also considered (this is expected to be\nexplained by a combination of internal absorption and surface reflection). The grey dashed\nline shows the model prediction where a dichromated gelatin depth of 11 \u00b5m is assumed\ninstead of 12 \u00b5m. 3 % additional energy loss (i.e., 18 % in total) presumably caused by\nmore internal absorption is also inferred. The same refractive index modulation amplitude\nis adopted (0.05) and the line density is 385 lines\/mm. It should be mentioned that a nearly\nidentical curve to the grey line can be obtained with coupled wave analysis by adopting a\nrefractive index modulation amplitude of 0.045 instead of changing the gelatin thickness.\nFig. 9. Same as Fig. 8, but for an incident angle of 15.0\u25e6.\nFig. 10. Same as Fig. 8, but for the incident angle of 17.5\u25e6.\nand\/or surface reflection are therefore equally likely candidates for the throughput variation,\nat least for this grating. Variations of the gelatin thickness across a VPH grating by \u223c 1 \u00b5m\nhave been suggested by direct measurements on a 14 cm \u00d7 15 cm grating with a line density\nof 850 lines\/mm ([3]). However, since refractive index modulation amplitude is proportional to\nexposure, an uneven exposure within the grating aperture is also a possible cause of the spatial\nvariation.\n4. Summary & Conclusion\nIn this paper, we report measurements of diffraction efficiency and angular dispersion of a large\nformat (\u223c 25 cm diameter) VPH grating optimized for near-infrared wavelengths (0.9 \u223c 1.8\n\u00b5m). The aim of this experiment is to see whether optical characteristics vary significantly\nacross the grating. We investigated three positions in the grating aperture with a separation of\n5 cm between each, using a 2 cm diameter beam to illuminate the grating. At each position,\nthroughput and diffraction angles were measured at several wavelengths. Our data indicate that\nwhilst the line density is nearly constant at the three positions (\u2264 3% variation), the throughput\nat one position can be different by \u223c 10% due mainly to a small shift of the throughput peak\ntowards shorter wavelengths. Comparing the data with predictions from coupled-wave analysis,\nwe find that this throughput variation can be explained by a combination of small variations in\ngelatin depth and\/or refractive index modulation amplitude and amount of energy lost by inter-\nnal absorption and\/or surface reflection. If a grating is used at a pupil plane of the spectrograph,\nsuch variations will be averaged out for all points in the field of view. However, if it is used in\na non-pupil plane, careful specification of tolerances would be required to obtain a system with\ngood astronomical performance.\nIn the near future, we intend to perform similar experiments to those reported here for several\nVPH gratings to see variations across a selection of gratings with increasing sampling points\nin the grating aperture. We will also conduct these experiments after exposing the gratings to\nvacuum and cryogenic temperatures. These results will be reported in a forthcoming paper.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank colleagues in Durham for their assistance with this work, particularly Peter Luke,\nJohn Bate, and the members of the mechanical workshop.
