In \ntheir natural state, most shallow lakes would have clear water and a thriving aquatic \nplant community. However, eutrophication often causes turbid water, high algal \nproductivity, and low species diversity and abundance of submerged macrophytes. In \nsevere cases, these impacts can have serious economic consequences on local \ncommunities. A key indicator of the ecological health of lake ecosystems is the \nmaximum growing depth (MGD) of aquatic plants. However, few existing studies \nhave yet quantified the relationship between changes in external phosphorus (P) input \nto a lake and associated variation in MGD. This study examines the relationship \nbetween these parameters in Loch Leven, a shallow, eutrophic loch in Scotland, UK. \nA baseline MGD value from 1905 and a series of more recent MGD values collected \nbetween 1972 and 2006 are compared to estimated phosphorus loads to the lake over \na period of eutrophication and recovery. The main factors that affect MGD within the \nloch are explored and the effectiveness of this parameter as an indicator of \neutrophication and recovery in shallow lakes is considered. The results suggest a close \nrelationship between changes in MGD of macrophytes and changes in the external P \nload to the loch over the study period. Variation in MGD macrophytes also seemed to \nreflect the \u201clight history\u201d that submerged macrophytes had been exposed to over the 5 \nyear period prior to sampling, rather than responding to short term, within year, \nvariations in water clarity. This suggests that changes in macrophyte MGD may be a \ngood indicator of overall, long term, changes in water quality that occur during the \neutrophication and restoration of shallow lakes. \n 2\nIntroduction \n \nEutrophication is a common problem in shallow lakes situated in lowland areas. This \nis because lowland catchments are often the focus of intensive agricultural activities, \nindustrial development and population growth. These activities tend to generate \nnutrient laden runoff and discharges of effluent that enter the drainage system and, \nultimately, the lake. \n \nIn their natural state, most shallow lakes would have clear water and a thriving \naquatic plant community (Scheffer, 1998). However, as a result of eutrophication, \nmany such lakes now suffer from turbid water, high algal productivity, and low \nspecies diversity and abundance of submerged macrophytes (Scheffer, 1998). In \nsevere cases, the amenity value of these lakes is significantly reduced due to the \nappearance of nuisance, and sometimes toxic, algal blooms during the summer \nmonths. These can have serious economic impacts on local communities and cause an \nincrease in water treatment costs for supply companies and downstream users \n(LLCMP, 1999; Drikas et al., 2001). \n \nThe need to improve water quality in these lakes is now widely recognised and, in \nmany cases, a range of remediation measures are now being considered. Most of these \nare based on the assumption that reducing the external nutrient input to the lake will \nrestore its water quality to pre-enrichment conditions (Sand-Jensen et al., 2008). \nHowever, water quality improvements in response to such management actions can be \ndifficult to predict in shallow, lowland lakes (Moss et al., 2005), especially when the \n 3\nreduction in external load is followed by an increase in nutrient release from the \nsediments that may last for many years (Sas, 1989). \n \nA key indicator of the ecological health of lake ecosystems is the maximum growing \ndepth (MGD) of aquatic plants. This is considered to be a good indicator not only of \nwater quality (particularly water clarity), but also of the physical habitat complexity \nof a site and its potential for supporting a rich associated biodiversity (Jeppesen et al, \n1998). However, with the exception of Sand-Jensen et al. (2008), no existing studies \nhave yet quantified the relationship between changes in external phosphorus (P) input \nto a lake and any associated variation in the MGD of macrophytes. This main aim of \nthis paper is to determine the relationship between MGD of macrophytes and \nestimated annual P load to Loch Leven, a shallow, eutrophic loch in Scotland, UK, \nover a period of eutrophication and recovery. In addition, the main factors that affect \nmacrophyte MGD within the loch are explored and the effectiveness of this parameter \nas an indicator of eutrophication and recovery in shallow lakes is considered.  \n \nSite description \n \nLoch Leven is a shallow, eutrophic loch in lowland Scotland, UK (Figure 1), which \nhas a surface area of 13.3 km2, and mean and maximum depths of 3.9 m and 25.5 m, \nrespectively. The loch has been a key focus of long term water quality monitoring \nactivities for almost 40 years, with more than 150 biological, chemical and physical \nvariables being recorded here at approximately fortnightly intervals over this period \n(May & Spears, submitted). These data have been supplemented by water quality data \n 4\nfor the period 1905 to 1968 that were obtained from the literature (Table 1; May et al., \nsubmitted). \n \nRecords of the aquatic plants within the loch date back more than 100 years. Changes \nin the species composition over this period are described by Dudley et al. (submitted). \nThese authors describe the current community as comprising Chara spp., \nPotamogeton berchtoldii \/ pusillus, Nitella \/ Tolypella, Callitriche hermaphroditica, \nPotamogeton perfoliatus, Potamogeton filiformis \/ pectinatus, Elodea canadensis, \nZannichellia palustris, Eleocharis acicularis, Myriophyllum spp., Potamogeton \npraelongus, Ranunculus spp. and Littorella uniflora. \n \nThe hydrology of the loch is not regulated naturally. Water level is controlled by a \nseries of sluice gates that were installed in the mid-1800s and, since then, have been \nmanually adjusted on a daily basis to control the rate of discharge at the outflow \n(Sargent & Ledger, 1992). As a result, although water levels can vary widely over the \nwinter period, the pattern of change from May to September (i.e. during the \nmacrophyte growing period) is very similar each year (Figure 2). This results in an \ninitial water level of about 107.2 m.a.s.l. at the end of April, which then declines in a \nmore or less linear way over the summer period and culminates in a minimum water \nlevel of about 106.7 m.a.s.l. towards the end of September. \n \nThe catchment of the loch covers an area of 145 km2 and comprises mainly \nagricultural land (~80%), with some areas of rough grazing and woodland in the \nuplands (Castle et al., 1999) that are situated at some distance from the loch. Sources \nof pollution from domestic waste water in the area comprise a small town and a few \n 5\nscattered farms and villages (Frost, 1996). Until recently, the number of people living \nhere had changed very little, with the resident population increasing from 7,500 in \n1930 to 7,800 people in the 1990s. Although there is little industry in the area, a \nwoollen mill situated on the side of the loch was responsible for discharging large \nquantities of P-laden effluent into the loch via one of the inflow streams from the mid \n1950s to the late 1980s (Holden & Caines, 1974; Caines & Harriman, 1976; Bailey-\nWatts & Kirika, 1987; Bailey-Watts & Kirika, 1999; May et al., submitted). \n \nMethods \n \nThe absolute maximum growing depth (MGD) of submerged, rooted, vascular plants \n(macrophytes) in the loch were obtained from the literature, which records surveys \ncarried out from 1905 to 2006 (West, 1910; Jupp et al., 1974; Bailey-Watts, 1979; \nRobson, 1986, 1990; Murphy & Milligan, 1993; Griffin & Milligan, 1999; Spears et \nal., 2009), and from personal observations made by one of the authors (Table 2).  The \nabsolute MGD was the deepest point at which macrophytes were recorded in the loch.  \nAll of the surveys were conducted along transects using a boat. In all surveys, except \nWest (1910), samples of vegetation were obtained at intervals along transects using a \n\u2018drag rake\u2019 attached to a piece of rope. The drag rake consisted of two opposing \ngarden rake heads fastened together back-to-back and covered by a coarse wire mesh, \nas described by Jupp et al. (1974).  Generally, over 200 samples were taken from \nmore than 30 transects providing an accurate estimate of the MGD (Spears et al., \n2009).  The MGD from 2004 and 2006 was the deepest point measured from only \nthree transects, although these transects were explicitly chosen from previous surveys \nas being those where macrophytes consistently grow deepest in the loch.  The \n 6\nsampling method, number of transects and sample points from the West (1910) survey \nare unknown. The results do, however, indicate that the West survey was very \ncomprehensive, being carried out alongside a bathymetric survey that comprised 538 \ndepth soundings (Murray & Pullar, 1910).  All of the surveys were undertaken at \nsimilar times of year (usually August\/September). \n \nPhosphorus loads to the loch were not available for the early 1900s, so the value for \n1905 was derived from an in-lake P concentration of 65 \u00b5g l-1 (Bennion, pers. \ncomm.), which had been inferred from palaeolimnological data using a diatom-TP \ntransfer coefficient (Bennion et al., 2004). The corresponding P load was back \ncalculated from this value using the measured loch flushing rate for 1905 (Sargent & \nLedger, 1992) and the lake response model of Dillon & Rigler (1974). \n \nPhosphorus loads to the loch had been measured in 1972, 1975, 1976, 1985, 1995 and \n2005 (May et al., submitted), but most of these years (apart from 1972 and 1975) did \nnot align exactly with macrophyte survey dates between 1972 and 2006. So, P loads \nfor several of these MGD years had to be interpolated from years in which the P load \nhad been measured. The exact methods of calculation for each interpolated value are \nshown in Table 1. In outline, the P load was estimated from the nearest measured \nvalue after adjustment for any documented change in point source discharges of P that \nhad occurred in the intervening period, e.g. upgrades to waste water treatment works \nor changes to industrial processes (LLCMP, 1999). Phosphorus in runoff from diffuse \nsources was assumed to be similar in both years because there was little inter-annual \nvariation in rainfall between \u2018measured\u2019 and \u2018estimated\u2019 years (Table 2). Even if there \nhad been more variation in rainfall between years, it is unlikely that this would have \n 7\ncaused large variations in overall P load to the loch, because external P load from this \ncatchment has, until very recently, always been heavily dominated by point source \ndischarges (60-80% of the P load until the mid 1990s). \n \nWeekly\/fortnightly data on water transparency, in-lake P concentrations and water \nlevel were obtained from long-term monitoring records for the loch held by the \nNatural Environment Research Council, UK. These records span the period 1968 to \n2006 (May & Spears, submitted). \n \nResults \n \nVariation in the maximum growing depth (MGD) of macrophytes recorded in 1905 \nand from 1972 to 2006 is shown in Figure 3. Although initially high (4.9 m in 1905), \nMGD had fallen to 1.5 m by the late 1960s. This value then increased slightly to \n2.5 m - 3.0 m in the late 1970s, and fell again to about 2 m in the early 1990s. By the \nlate 1990s, macrophytes had begun to colonise deeper areas again, with MGD \nprogressively increasing from 3.6 m to 4.5 m between 1999 and 2006. \n \nCorresponding variation in external P loads to the loch between 1905 and 2006 is \nsummarised in Figure 4. The data show that P input was relatively low (i.e. about \n5 t y-1 or 0.38 g P m-2 y-1) in the early 1900s, but had risen to 20 t y-1 (1.54 g P m-2 y-1) \nby 1985. From the mid 1980s onwards, the external P load fell progressively to about \n40 per cent of the level recorded in 1985 as a result of management activities within \nthe catchment (May et al., submitted). \n \n 8\nWhen these two sets of data are combined (Figure 5), there appears to be a strong \ninverse relationship between macrophyte MGD and external P load to the loch over \nthe entire study period. In 1905, when the P load was only about 5 t y-1, the MGD was \nabout 4.9 m. As the P load increased and decreased between the mid 1960s and mid \n1990s, MGD varied accordingly, reaching a value of less than 2 m when P loads were \nhighest. From the mid 1990s onwards, the MGD progressively increased, reaching \naround 4.5 m by 2006. These changes appear to track the progress of the 60 percent \nreduction in external P load to the loch that was achieved between 1985 and 2005 \n(Figure 4). \n \nA close relationship was found between MGD and the average of the annual mean \nSecchi disk transparency readings collected over the previous 5 year period \n(Figure  6), although there was little evidence that MGD responded to shorter term \nvariation in this parameter. This suggests that MGD provides an integrated response \nto long term changes in water clarity rather than a more immediate response to short \nterm variation in this parameter. \n \nDiscussion \n \nThere are comparatively few studies of the response of lakes to reduced nutrient loads \nand most of those that do exist have largely focused on changes in phytoplankton \nspecies and abundance (Anderson et al, 2005; Jeppesen et al., 2005). In some cases, \nthese changes have been found to have knock-on effects on macrophyte communities, \naltering their species composition and abundance (Nichols & Lathrop, 1994; Egertson \net al., 2004; Valley & Drake, 2007) and having an impact on their maximum growing \n 9\ndepth (S\u00f8ndergaard et al., 2005). It is widely believed that this is because submerged \nmacrophytes fail to thrive when phytoplankton densities are high (Jones et al., 2002; \nScheffer 1998). It is well established that phytoplankton densities tend to be high \nwhen in-lake phosphorus (P) concentrations are high, and that these P concentrations \nare often linked to the magnitude of the external P load (OECD, 1982; Jeppesen et al., \n2005). \n \nThis study has clearly shown that the maximum growing depth (MGD) of \nmacrophytes in Loch Leven varied markedly between 1972 and 2006, apparently \nreflecting changes in the estimated P loading to the loch from external sources over \nthat period. The most recent MGD values (4.2 m in 2004 and 4.5 m in 2006) are very \nsimilar to the baseline value of 4.9 m that was recorded in 1905, i.e. before serious \neutrophication problems began. As increasing MGD is one of the key targets for lake \nrestoration at this site (LLCMP, 1999), it is important to identify the main factors that \nhave contributed to this response. \n \nOne possible explanation is that the observed changes in MGD were actually only \napparent effects caused by variation in water level or of variation in the management \nof the outflow, rather than changes in P load. This is an important consideration for \ntwo reasons. Firstly, MGD is measured relative to a baseline that is defined by the \nwater level in the loch at the time of each survey and secondly because significant \ninter- and intra-annual variations in water level over the growing season could also \naffect the depth of macrophyte colonisation. However, examination of the loch level \nrecords for the years in which macrophyte surveys were undertaken showed that, \nalthough loch level varied by more than 1 m over the year as a whole, temporal \n 10\nchanges in water level over the macrophyte growing season (April to September) \nwere remarkably similar each year and variability during the macrophyte survey \nperiod (usually August to September) was very small (\u00b1 0.2 m) compared with the \nlarge change in MGD over the study period (3.5 m). The reason for this consistent \nwater level is because summer water levels are controlled by the manual operation of \nsluice gates on the outflow. It can, therefore, be concluded that the variations in \nmacrophyte MGD recorded were real and unlikely to be caused by variation in water \nlevel. \n \nAnother possibility is that, in some way, changes in the external P load to the loch had \nindirectly affected the depth distribution of the macrophytes over time, possibly \nthrough their impact on in-lake P concentrations and water clarity values, following \nthe classic series of events described by many authors including Scheffer (1998) and \nJeppesen et al. (2005). However, the data do not completely support this hypothesis in \nLoch Leven. Recent trends in annual mean P concentrations within the loch over the \nperiod 1969 \u2013 2008 (Carvalho et al., submitted) seem to suggest that there is little \ndirect relationship between this parameter and the variation in macrophyte MGD that \nhas been reported here. In fact, according to these authors, the biggest fall in P \nconcentrations in Loch Leven occurred in the early 1970s, before any improvements \nwere seen in the aquatic macrophytes, and P concentrations were increasing in the \nmid-1990s, when MGD recovery was most pronounced. This suggests that the link \nbetween P load and macrophyte MGD is not mediated simply through changes in in-\nlake P concentration. As has been shown in other studies of recovery from nutrient \nenrichment, other factors, such as biological resilience, may influence the response of \nMGD to nutrients (Scheffer, 1998; Jeppesen et al., 2005). \n 11\n Spence (1982) suggests other factors that may also be important in determining the \nMGD of macrophytes in lakes, including sediment conditions, topography, gradient, \nwind\/wave action, water temperature and under water light climate. Other authors \nsuggest that differences in sampling methods can also affect the determination of this \nparameter (Canfield et al., 1985; Spears et al., 2009). However, it is generally \nbelieved that wind\/wave action and light availability are probably the most important \nof these (Spence, 1982; Vant et al., 1986; Riis & Hawes, 2003). The possible impact \nof these factors on the MGD of macrophytes at Loch Leven is explored below. \n \nSince macrophyte MGD in Loch Leven changed markedly over the last 100 years, it \nseems unlikely that any of these changes were caused by environmental factors that \nhave remained stable over that period. So, it was concluded that unsuitable sediments, \ntopography, gradient and variation in sampling methods were unlikely to be important \ndrivers of the observed changes. Also, it seems unlikely that long term variation in \nwind\/wave action is the main cause of this variation, because this study has shown a \nvery strong link between MGD and external P load that would be difficult to explain \nin terms of this parameter. Although temperature gradients have been identified as \nlimiting the depth distribution of macrophytes in deep, clear water lakes (Dale, 1986), \nthis effect is unlikely to occur in a shallow, well mixed lake, such as Loch Leven, \nwhich shows very little temperature variation over depth within the top 5 m of the \nwater column (May, 1980). Indeed, Pearsall (1920) and Spence (1964, 1982) found no \nevidence of temperature limitation of macrophyte MGD occurring in any lakes within \nthe British Isles. \n \n 12\nIt is generally believed that one of the most important factors restricting macrophytes \nto the shallow areas of Loch Leven is decreased water clarity caused by increased \nphytoplankton densities during cultural eutrophication (Jupp & Spence, 1977). \nHowever, to date, there has been little hard evidence of this. Initially, when this was \ninvestigated on a year-on-year basis, the long term monitoring data seemed to suggest \nthat there was no direct relationship between MGD and water clarity at this site. This \nunexpected result appeared to contrast markedly with the findings from other studies \nsuch as Chambers & Kalff (1984), Skubinna et al. (1995), Middleboe & Markager \n(1997), Jeppesen et al (2005) and Sand-Jensen et al. (2008). However, further \ninvestigation revealed a very close relationship between macrophyte MGD and the \noverall average of the annual mean water transparency values recorded at this site \nover the 5 year period preceding the date of sampling. This supports the assertion put \nforward by Canfield et al. (1985), R\u00f8rslett & Johansen (1995) and Schwarz & Hawes \n(1997) that submerged aquatic plants tend to integrate water clarity conditions over \ntime in relation to their depth penetration, and that \u201clight history\u201d is more likely to \ndetermine MGD than water clarity at or around the time of sampling  \n \nThe impact of water clarity on the depth distribution of macrophytes may also be \nexacerbated by the extent of epiphyte growth on the surface of the plants, as this also \nlimits the amount of light available to the macrophytes for growth. Sand-Jensen \n(1990) outlines the importance of this shading effect by providing evidence that, in \nsome cases, epiphytes are more important than phytoplankton for attenuating light \nbefore it reaches submerged macrophytes. As there are no records of epiphyte growth \nassociated with the long term data on macrophyte distribution at Loch Leven, the \nimportance of this effect at this site could not be tested.  However, because epiphyte \n 13\ngrowth is often positively related to nutrient availability, this could certainly be a \ncontributory factor in the development of the strong relationship between MGD and \nexternal P load that has been observed at this site. \n \nConclusions \n \nThere is documentary evidence that increasing annual loads of P from the catchment, \nespecially between the 1960s and the mid 1980s, were responsible for increasing \neutrophication problems at Loch Leven in the 1970s and 1980s (LLCMP, 1999). \nRestoration measures were put in place that resulted in a 60 per cent reduction in P \nload to the loch by the mid 1990s (Bailey-Watts & Kirika, 1999). Changes in MGD at \nthis site seem to reflect these changes in external P load. Variation in MGD also \nappears to reflect the \u201clight history\u201d that submerged macrophytes have been exposed \nto over the 5 year period prior to sampling, although not to short term, within year, \nvariations in water clarity. This suggests that changes in macrophyte MGD may be a \ngood indicator of the overall, long term changes in water quality that occur during the \neutrophication and restoration of shallow lakes. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nWe are grateful to the Loch Leven Trustees for daily outflow records and to Helen \nBennion, University College London, for an estimate of the P concentration in Loch \nLeven in 1905 based on palaeolimnological records.
