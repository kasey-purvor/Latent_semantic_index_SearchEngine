While numbers are not everything, it was very encouraging both that\nmore than 350 delegates registered and that they delivered approximately 200\npresentations, including software demonstrations and poster sessions. For ALT to have\nreached numbers comparable to long-established professional associations in the\ncomparatively short period of its existence is a remarkable achievement.\nNumbers have a downside, of course, especially as many delegates (and their sponsoring\ninstitutions) want to appear on the programme as well as wander from session to session.\nThe inevitably large number of parallel events produced a wealth of activity but also the\nneed for delegates to make difficult choices of which sessions to attend. None the less, the\nlarge attendance provided a golden opportunity - which, casual observation suggests, was\neagerly grasped - for that most intellectually productive of all activities, networking.\nPerhaps ALTC-96 attracted fewer novices, on the one hand, and fewer institutional\n'movers and shakers', on the other, than the organizers had hoped. But the focus on\nexperienced practitioners of learning technology helped to produce an atmosphere of\nintellectual excitement, capped by Diana Laurillard's magisterial closing keynote address,\nwhich reaffirmed the centrality of academic criteria in evaluating the effectiveness of\ntechnology-assisted teaching and learning.\nWithin the conference theme of integrating technology into the curriculum, certain\ncategories were sparsely represented among the presentations, papers on dissemination\nand staff development being especially thin on the ground. Assessment and course\nstructure were slightly more amply served, as (surprisingly enough) were categories more\n3\nEditorial\noften associated with committee rooms than with IT labs: institutional strategies and\nteaching and learning services. As ever, new developments and (much more so) case\nstudies were plentiful. Most numerous of all - in marked contrast to the situation at\nALTC-94 - was evaluation, which secured an even larger proportion of the papers\naccepted for this special number of ALT-J. The popularity of that category, so crucial to\nthe successful integration of learning technology into the curriculum, provides strong\nsupport for the proposition that ALTC-96 marked the coming-of-age of learning\ntechnology as a field. Evaluation, at the conference as elsewhere, often involves cost-\nbenefit analysis, and few if any presentations at ALTC-96 subscribed to the 'IT as panacea\nfor cost pressures' school of thought. A realistic optimism focused on quality, rather than\na euphoria focused on pricing, characterized the keynote addresses of Strathclyde's John\nSpence, who emphasized the pedagogical potential of Scottish, UK and world networks,\nand of Glasgow's Graeme Davies, who stressed the value, for improved teaching and\nlearning, of the courseware produced by the UK's Teaching and Learning Technology\nProgramme (TLTP). Thus the conference contributed to the rapid decline of belief in the\nmonetary efficiency of IT, an approach very popular only a few years ago but now\ncomprehensively rejected, notably in the evidence submitted to the Commission of\nInquiry into Higher Education headed by Sir Ron Dearing.\nIf ALTC-96 suggests that learning technology is increasingly both a mature and a shrewd\nfield, how does it relate to the focal point of late twentieth-century higher-education\nanxiety: (assessed) research quality? The number of papers submitted for this special\nnumber of ALT-J was small in comparison with the wealth of interesting papers presented\nat the conference. Among the many reasons for this discrepancy may be the marginal\nposition that research and publication in learning technology occupies in the UK (from\nwhich the bulk of participants and paper-givers were drawn), particularly with respect to\nthe funding councils' 1996 Research Assessment Exercise. Admittedly, the councils\nattempted to persuade assessment panels to look kindly on courseware development,\nespecially within TLTP. Yet it would seem that at best this concession made involvement\nin courseware production an allowable excuse for a failure to produce four high-quality\npublications based on 'conventional' research. The funding councils' encouragement to\nresearch in teaching and learning was even more gentle than the nudge given to\ncourseware development, and was perhaps even less effective - especially since individuals\nhad to allocate all their publications either to their 'home' discipline or to education per\nse. Without a change of heart, research and development in learning technology may\ndecelerate as individuals turn increasingly to research activities unambiguously prized by\nthe Research Assessment Exercise. This is a threat not just to the field and its\npractitioners but to the teaching and learning goals of the funding councils themselves.\nPerhaps the Dearing Commission will produce recommendations that will prompt the\nfunding councils and other interested parties to increase their esteem for educational-\ntechnology development and the research associated with it.\nAs this special number of ALT-J demonstrates, the range and depth of current research in\nlearning technology support such a change of policy. Of the papers published in this issue,\ntwo fall under the heading of new developments. The continued scope for innovative new\ntechnology, and its imaginative use in education, is nowhere better demonstrated than in\nthe description of the Origami project by Harding et al. It will take some time for the\n4\nALT-] Volume 5 Number I\npotential of this technology to be assessed, but it is refreshing to be reminded that the\ndevelopment of technological tools is still an astonishingly active area. The World Wide\nWeb was a new tool not so long ago, but it is now in routine use in the world of teaching\nand learning. The large number of papers at the conference which were concerned with\nthis medium are represented here by the contribution by Meadows et al. The scope for\ninternational collaboration between teachers and students and the effectiveness of\nexercises such as this in broadening students' learning experiences are very apparent.\nCourse structure and assessment are essential parts of any strategy which aims to\nintegrate technology into the curriculum, and these topics are represented by the papers\nof Brailsford et al, and Callear and King. The former gives us much to think about in\ndescribing the experiences of using the concept of discourse to support the learning which\ntakes place within a course. The latter reflects on experience gained with computer-based\ntesting in a variety of guises. The paper by Martin addresses the institutional background\nby describing the use of a general IT awareness course to provide students with generic\nskills which will prepare them for degree programmes.\nWe remarked above that the emphasis on evaluation of educational effectiveness which\nwas evident at the conference is indicative of the fact that learning technology has come of\nage. This is confirmed in the six papers in this area which have been accepted for this issue\nof the journal. Three of these - by Draper, Gunn and Mitchell - address general, wide-\nranging issues. There are challenges here to our traditional way of viewing evaluation and\nhow it should be conducted. The remaining three papers - by Issroff et al, Scanlon et al\nand Whitelegg et al -provide stimulating case studies of evaluation in action.\nThus this special number of the journal, like the conference from which it derives, reveals\nlearning technology as a field which, despite some lack of recognition from the research\nestablishment, is characterized by growing self-confidence, increased achievement and\nwidening impact on teaching and learning in higher education.
