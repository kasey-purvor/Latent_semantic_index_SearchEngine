We found that RECs frequently identify process \nerrors in applications from researchers that are not deemed \"favourable\" at first review. Errors include \nprocedural violations (identified in 74% of all applications), missing information (68%), slip-ups (44%) \nand discrepancies (25%).  Important questions arise about why the level of error identified by RECs is so \nhigh, and about how errors of different types should be handled.\n 3 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nResearch Ethics Committees (RECs) are regularly subjected to scrutiny in the medical journals. 1-10 \nMany researcher complaints focus on the apparently \"nit-picking\" nature of the revisions prescribed by \nRECs before a favourable opinion is issued. 11-13 However, there has been little systematic examination \nof the types of process \"errors\" RECs ask researchers to rectify, as distinct from the ethical issues they \nask them to resolve. This paper presents an analysis of the types of process errors that UK RECs \nidentified in applications from researchers.  \n \nMETHODS \nWe analysed letters written by NHS RECs in the UK to applicants following the first meeting at which an \napplication was considered. These letters are uploaded to the Research Ethics Database (RED) \nmaintained by the National Research Ethics Service. \n \nRECs can make three possible decisions when they first consider applications: favourable, provisional, \nor unfavourable (Box 1).  \n \nBox 1: Decisions RECs may make  \n \n\u2022 A \u2018favourable\u2019 opinion means that an application is approved without further amendments; \nthese constitute ~15% of decisions made by RECs at first consideration of an application.* \n\u2022  \u2018Provisional\u2019 opinions constitute ~64% of decisions at first review, and require applicants to \nmake a response addressing issues raised in the letter before a final opinion can be issued. The \nfinal opinion may be either favourable or unfavourable. \n\u2022 An \u2018unfavourable\u2019 opinion (~8% of all submissions) at first review amounts to a rejection. \n \nRECs may also decide that applications are \u2018outside remit\u2019.  \n \nSome applications are withdrawn (~10% before review and ~3% after a provisional opinion has been \nissued).  \n \n*Data based on the period October 2005-March 2006 from the NRES website and refer to all \napplications. \n \nWe focused on applications that received either an unfavourable or provisional decision at first review, \nas such decisions indicate that there was something in the application that has troubled the REC and \nrequires a response from the applicants before a final decision can be rendered. The final outcome was \nrecorded where available. \n \nCriteria for inclusion of a letter in our sample were as follows: \n \n\u2022 The letter conveyed a \u201cprovisional\u201d or \u201cunfavourable\u201d opinion. \n\u2022 The letter concerned an application considered by a REC for the first time during our \u201celigible \nperiods\u201d: July 2005, October 2005, January 2006 and April 2006. These periods were chosen to \nminimise seasonal effects in application submission, such as an increase in student projects prior \nto the academic year etc. \n \nFifty-five RECs did not upload letters to the RED during our eligible periods and were excluded, leaving \n115 RECs from which letters could be sampled. The first letter that met our eligibility criteria for each of \nthe 115 RECs was chosen for inclusion in the study. Unfavourable opinions were purposefully over-\nrepresented to yield sufficient letters for analysis, so that they formed 20% of the initial sample. The \nremaining 80% of letters were those applications with provisional opinions. In addition, because \napplications that were initially \"provisional\" but were subsequently issued with an unfavourable opinion \nwere of particular interest, this type of application was also purposefully over-sampled by including all \nsuch applications between March 2004 and July 2006 for which a letter was available.  \n \n 4 \nIn order to analyse the letters, the techniques of ethnographic content analysis (ECA) were employed. 14 \nECA involves the development of a coding scheme or framework grounded in the data (in contrast to \napproaches that use a pre-specified framework). Our framework was generated initially through close \ninspection and comparison across the texts of letters used in a previous study, 15 but was modified \nextensively in response to the new data in this project. Explicit specifications were devised to aid data \nassignment to analytic categories, a process which was facilitated by the use of QSR N6 software.  \nOur project was deemed by NRES not to require research ethics committee review as it was considered \nto be service evaluation. Letters were fully anonymised before analysis, and where appropriate, in \nillustrative quotations, identifying details have been modified or removed. \n \nRESULTS \nOur sampling identified 141 letters for analysis (Table 1), and suggested that decisions may vary \nbetween different types of study.  \n \nTable 1 REC letters and outcomes of the ethical review process by type of study \nFull decision All letters \nIntervention \nstudies \nNon- intervention \nstudies \nQualitative \nstudies \nProvisional then favourable 85 (60%) 19 (44%) 36 (60%) 30 (79%) \nProvisional then unfavourable 26 (18%) 13 (30%) 9 (15%) 4 (11%) \nUnfavourable at first review 23 (16%) 8 (19%) 11 (18%) 4 (11%) \nProvisional, final outcome unknown 7 (5%) 3 (7%) 4 (7%) 0 (0%) \nTotal  141 (100%) 43 (100%) 60 (100%) 38 (100%) \n \nIn other papers15,16 we have reported on the ethical issues raised by RECs in their letters about these \napplications; in this paper, we were concerned with the issues that were not (strictly speaking) \"ethical\" \nin character, but instead referred to various kinds of process errors which RECs perceived as having \nbeen made by the applicants (though we recognise that such errors may have ethical dimensions or \nconsequences). We are using the term \u201cprocess error\u201d here to describe lapses in paperwork, application \nprocesses or management issues. A process error by applicants was pointed out by the REC in 123 \n(87%) of the 141 letters. Of the applications identified as having an error, 101 were given a provisional \nopinion and 22 an unfavourable opinion. \n \nWe classified errors into four types: procedural violations, missing information, slip-ups, and \ndiscrepancies.  \n \nProcedural violations \nFailure of applicants to comply with correct procedures was noted in 104 (74%) letters. Problems \nidentified by RECs included failure to register trials properly, to follow NRES application requirements, to \nobtain necessary signatures, and so on.  \n \n\u201cThe Committee suggests that the trial should be registered as a Randomised Controlled Trial \nand gain an ISRCTN number\u201d (Letter 11, provisional opinion) \n \n\u201c.... this study has been identified as a multi-site study. However if this had been the case, it \nwould have been necessary to submit the study via the Central Allocation System [CAS], which \ndid not happen.\u201d (Letter 35, provisional opinion) \n \nMissing information \nREC letters pointed out missing or inadequate information in 96 (68%) of the 141 letters in our sample. \nTypes of missing information included entire documents (e.g. participant information leaflets) or failure to \nprovide full information within documents (such as missing details from the protocol).  \n \n\u201cThe Committee noted that the study would involve healthy adults, but an Information Sheet for \nthe control group had not been provided. Any resubmission of this proposal must be \naccompanied by copies of the complete documentation. (Letter 51, unfavourable opinion) \n \n 5 \n\u201cThe Committee felt there was insufficient information available for a decision to be made on this \nproposal (e.g. it would appear that no literature review has been done nor have the current \nprocedures and the rationale behind them been explained).\u201d (Letter 112, unfavourable opinion) \n \nSlip-ups \n\"Slip-ups\", included minor errors such as errors in grammar and spelling as well as typos, failing to tick \nboxes, and so on, and were noted by RECs in 62 (44%) letters. \n \n\u201cIn the protocol there is a spelling error on Page 4, Question 4: \u201cthere\u201d should be \u201ctheir\u201d.

Examples included inconsistencies in descriptions of aspects of the research between various \nparts of the form, differences in the description of the research intervention between the application form \nand the participant information leaflet, and so on. \n \n\u201cFlow Chart should be the same as [answer] given in A20 i.e. participants should only be \ncontacted by post in the first instance.\u201d (Letter 20, provisional opinion) \n \n\u201cPlease advise if results will automatically be given to participants following the completion of the \nstudy?

RECs identified such problems in most (87%) applications that \ndid not get a favourable opinion at first review.  \n \nIt could be argued that what is happening in the letters when RECs point out process errors (especially \nthose that are perhaps \u201cnon-ethical\u201d in nature) is primarily a display of RECs' care and attention, and of \ntheir conscientious execution of their duties (down to the last spelling mistake). 16 This could be seen as \nevidence of \"control-freakery\u201d and \"nit-picking\", 17 and part of a more general tendency for RECs to \nconcern themselves with issues not strictly within their remit, including scientific design.18 A perhaps \nkinder interpretation might be that REC members may feel themselves responsible for ensuring that \n 6 \napproaches made to patients are correct in every detail. Further research would be needed to explore \nthe processes of RECs and the views and intentions of their members.  \n \nWhat RECs should do about process errors is an important question.  Some errors, such as the \"slip-\nups\", are perhaps rather trivial, in the sense that they can easily be corrected.  Such errors alone, though \nundesirable and possibly indicating a certain lack of care, perhaps should not hold up the granting of a \nfavourable opinion for a study but instead their correction should be a condition of approval.  Missing \ninformation is a rather different problem, since it is arguably not unreasonable for a REC to wish to see \nall relevant information before making a judgement on the ethical provenance of a study. Indeed, a \nmissing information leaflet would prevent a REC from fulfilling one of its central roles \u2013 that of ensuring \nthat the consent process is appropriate. Similarly, discrepancies are of concern to RECs, since it may \nnot be clear which plan the researcher intends to follow if there is more than one version in play. Finally, \nit may not be possible for RECs to tolerate procedural violations if they are to ensure consistency and \nfairness, as well as account for their actions.  In addition there may be serious consequences for the \nresearchers if they do not register their clinical trial or gain approval from the appropriate regulator(s). \n \nA further important question clearly concerns why the level of error identified by RECs is so high. It could \nbe argued that the rules are too complex and demanding, and that some level of error is therefore \ninevitable. This explanation would require further investigation, particularly focused on how processes \ncould be simplified and streamlined. It might also be the case that better administrative screening of \napplications before they reach the Committee stage would help to reduce the number of errors seen by \nRECs. Of course, it could also be argued that better thoroughness and attention by researchers would \nalso help to bring down the error rate. \n \nOur data do not allow conclusions to be drawn about the extent to which \"errors\", rather than ethical \ntroubles, can lead to deferring or withholding of favourable opinions from RECs. However, it is not \nimpossible that RECs interpret process errors as indicating possible incompetence, lack of attention, or \nlack of respect, and thus may tend to be less inclined to be sympathetic to such applications. What is \nperhaps clear is that avoiding mistakes, oversights, and omissions is in researchers' interests, not least \nbecause they are probably mostly avoidable. Future research might investigate whether RECs vary \nsystematically in their identification of errors, as well as how researchers can be best supported to avoid \nmaking errors. \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nWe thank our colleagues Richard Ashcroft, Alan Bryman and Clare Jackson, who helped to develop the \ncoding scheme and commented on the manuscript. \n \nCOMPETING INTERESTS \nNone.  \n \nFUNDING \nNational Research Ethics Service; Economic and Social Research Council (grant number RES-000-22-\n1908). \n \nEXCLUSIVE LICENCE \nThe Corresponding Author has the right to grant on behalf of all authors and does grant on behalf of all \nauthors, an exclusive licence (or non-exclusive for government employees) on a worldwide basis to the \nBMJ Publishing Group Ltd and its Licensees to permit this article (if accepted) to be published in JME \nand any other BMJPGL products to exploit all subsidiary rights, as set out in our licence. \n \n 7 \nREFERENCES \n1.
