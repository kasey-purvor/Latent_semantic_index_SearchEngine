Like a Russian doll, however,\nthe private sphere of the household nests within broader socio-political institutions. Proposed\nhere is a relative gender power model incorporating both individual and policy-derived\nresources to explain differences in the division of household tasks. The sensitivity of the model\nto state-level policy differences is tested using data from the second wave of the US National\nSurvey of Families and Households. After controlling for women\u2019s individual resources, laws\nand policies enhancing women\u2019s economic circumstances in the event of a divorce such as\nreceipt of transfers, child support and property settlement predict that men in couples perform\na greater share of domestic tasks. This evidence confirms that the state can ameliorate gender\nhierarchies and inequality.\nAcross industrialised countries, men contribute one-third of the household time\nin domestic tasks despite women\u2019s rising labour force participation (Gershuny,\n2000). One explanation offered for this \u2018stalled revolution\u2019 (Hochschild, 1989) is\nthat housework represents a symbolic as well as material product of marriage\nthat produces and reproduces dominant and subordinate gender statuses\n(Fenstermaker Berk, 1985; West and Zimmerman, 1987). The resilience of the\ngender hierarchy suggests that women\u2019s choice shall forever be constrained\nbetween economic vulnerability within a male breadwinner family, and carrying\na double burden of paid and unpaid labour.\nLike a Russian doll, however, the private sphere of the household nests\nwithin broader socio-political institutions, a point argued by feminists for over\ntwo decades (Hartmann, 1981; Hernes, 1987; Pateman, 1988; Hobson, 1990; Lewis,\n1992; Orloff, 1993; Glucksmann, 1995). While many academics cede the point,\nonly recently have they considered policy influences in cross-national analyses\n2 lynn prince cooke\nof the division of housework. Earlier work found no significant cross-national\ndifferences in either the gendered division of labour or effects of individual\nattributes predicting it (Kalleberg and Rosenfeld, 1990; Baxter, 1997). More recent\nanalyses find more egalitarian divisions of labour in countries with greater gender\nequality in political, social and economic institutions, although the magnitude\nof differences proves modest (Batalava and Cohen, 2002; Davis and Greenstein,\n2004; Fuwa, 2004).\nWith these studies, however, it remains difficult to eliminate possible\nunmeasured cultural effects responsible for both the evolution of differing\npolicies and observed division of housework across diverse countries (Pfau-\nEffinger, 1998). In addition, these studies do not specify exactly how policy affects\nthe household division of labour, and as a result fall short of revealing effects of\nspecific policy-related factors on the division of housework. Here I will expand the\nbasic individual resource model to argue that policy affects relative gender power\nwithin the household. This expansion takes into account the impact of public\nand private transfers as sources of relative power, in addition to the traditional\nresources of education and earnings. Also important in couple negotiations is the\nattractiveness of alternatives to the relationship (Blau, 1960; Breen and Cooke,\n2005), which vary with laws regarding property distribution and child support in\nthe event of divorce. The macro-environment also shapes alternatives, as women\nare at greater risk of poverty absent a man (Daly, 1992).\nAfter detailing the relative gender power model, I then capitalise on the\nfederalist US structure and interstate policy variation to assess effects of specific\npolicies within a single national context. One might argue that cultural variation\nexists within a given country as well as across national borders, but more egregious\ndifferences are minimised. The importance of the state in reinforcing patriarchy\nhas long been claimed (Hartmann, 1981; Pateman, 1988), but to my knowledge\nthis study provides the first assessment of how specific policies within a country\nperpetuate or ameliorate gender hierarchies and inequality. Recent evidence also\nindicates greater equity within the home predicts favourable family outcomes\nsuch as higher fertility (Ola\u00b4h, 2003; Cooke, 2004; Torr and Short, 2004) and\nmarital stability (Cooke, 2006). Consequently, encouraging gender equity appears\nto be in the best interests of individuals and the state.\nThe division of housework\nThree perspectives dominate analyses of the division of household tasks: relative\npower or resources, time availability and the gender perspective. Most empirical\nevidence suggests that relative resources such as education and employment\npredict some shift in the division of household tasks, but not equity (Blair and\nLichter, 1991; Kamo, 1994; Shelton and John, 1996). Wives\u2019 domestic hours vary\nwith their own work hours (Goldscheider and Waite, 1991; Shelton and John, 1996;\npolicy pathways to gender power 3\nBianchi et al., 2000), but the sharpest drop in domestic hours across countries has\noccurred among women who are out of the labour market (Gershuny,2000). Most\nof the observed increase in men\u2019s share of domestic tasks over the past 40years\nresults from women\u2019s reduction in their own domestic hours (Goldscheider and\nWaite, 1991; Shelton and John, 1996; Bianchi et al., 2000), as household tasks\nincreasingly become commodified in the productive sector (Glucksmann, 1995).\nSocial exchange models (Blau, 1960) extend the relative resource model to\ninclude the influence of alternatives to the marriage on gender power. If being\nsingle would make one partner worse off than the other, the one with better non-\nmarital alternatives has more power within the marriage; as Hobson phrased it,\n\u2018the fewer the exit possibilities, the weaker the voice\u2019 (1990: 238). For example,\nLennon and Rosenfeld (1994) find that US women with more alternatives to the\nmarriage perceive unequal divisions of domestic tasks as unfair, whereas women\nwith fewer alternatives report greater acceptance of the situation.\nTogether, however, neither time nor relative resources explains the\ncontinuing gendered division of domestic tasks. Further, contrary to the \u2018logic\nof the pocketbook\u2019 (Hochschild 1989), as women\u2019s earnings exceed those of\nmen, an even more traditional division of domestic tasks emerges (Fenstermaker\nBerk, 1985; Hochschild, 1989). Brines (1994) finds both US husbands and wives\ndecrease their domestic hours as wives become the primary breadwinner, with\nwomen\u2019s actions predicted under the relative resource model, but men\u2019s actions\ninterpreted as reflecting their need for \u2018gender display\u2019 of manhood vis-a`-vis the\nnon-traditional economic situation. Whether it is the man or the woman who\nexhibits compensatory behaviour under these circumstances, however, varies\nacross countries. Among Australian couples, the woman increases her domestic\nhours when her relative earnings increase above equality, whereas Australian\nmen show little evidence of adjusting their domestic hours (Bittman et al., 2003).\nThe authors offer that Australian women\u2019s corrective response is larger than that\nfound for US women because policy reinforcement of the family wage and male\nbreadwinner model makes women\u2019s primary breadwinning more anomalous in\nAustralia than in the United States (O\u2019Connor et al., 1999). This suggests that at\nleast part of the division of housework varies by the degree to which the state\nreinforces hierarchical gender roles in paid labour, analogous to Glucksmann\u2019s\n(1995) argument that the two are reciprocal in a \u2018total organisation of labour\u2019.\nThis argument is not new (Hartmann, 1981; Blumberg, 1984), but only\nrecently has comparative evidence emerged assessing whether the gendered\ndivision of household labour varies with the socio-political structure in which\nit is negotiated. The first comparisons found no significant differences across\na range of countries (Kalleberg and Rosenfeld, 1990; Baxter, 1997), leading\nBaxter to conclude that we will only witness men\u2019s greater participation in\nunpaid labour as women\u2019s participation in paid labour increases. More recently,\nhowever, researchers find systematic cross-country differences once controlling\n4 lynn prince cooke\nfor individual resources such as education and employment (Batalava and Cohen,\n2002; Davis and Greenstein, 2004; Fuwa, 2004). These studies reveal that across\ncountries, women retain primary responsibility for laundry, shopping, deciding\nwhat to have for dinner, and tending to sick family members. Fuwa (2004)\nalso finds using the United Nations\u2019 Gender Empowerment Measure, however,\nthat time availability and gender ideology effects predicting the precise division\nprove stronger or weaker for women in more versus less egalitarian countries,\nrespectively. This suggests that policy alters relative gender power beyond direct\neffects on individual employment.\nThe country differences noted above, however, are either theorised from\nmainstream literature on welfare state regimes (Kalleberg and Rosenfeld, 1990;\nBaxter, 1997; Davis and Greenstein, 2004) or based on the Gender Empowerment\nMeasure reflecting relative employment and aggregate political representation\n(Batalava and Cohen, 2002; Fuwa, 2004). None of these studies assessed the\nimpact of specific policies on the gendered division of labour.\nPolicy effects on relative resources\nAn expanded relative power framework captures possible direct and indirect\npolicy effects. Esping-Andersen (1990) employs a power resource perspective\nto develop his welfare regime typology, making his approach conceptually\ncompatible with the individual-level relative resource model. Orloff (1993)\nsuggests adding two dimensions to Esping-Andersen\u2019s (1990) typology to\nincorporate gender effects: women\u2019s access to paid work, and the capacity to\nform and maintain an autonomous household. O\u2019Connor\u2019s (1993) concept of\npersonal autonomy is similar. The state\u2019s performance on these two dimensions\naffects women\u2019s relative power within the family, in turn predicting the division\nof domestic tasks as depicted in Figure 1.\nEducation and employment policies, as well as support for maternal\nemployment to balance the competing work\u2013family time demands better,\nenhance women\u2019s relative power via her access to paid work. Across OECD\ncountries, women\u2019s greater educational attainment, lower marginal tax rates,\nchildcare subsidies, and paid parental leave all predict greater female labour force\nparticipation (Jaumotte, 2003). As a result of such policies, mothers\u2019 share of\nlabour market earnings among married and cohabiting parents is greater in the\nNordic countries, as compared with the Netherlands, Germany and the United\nKingdom, where there is minimal support for maternal employment (Gornick\nand Meyers, 2003).\nRelative power also derives from policies shaping economic alternatives to a\nmarriage, what Orloff terms the ability to establish an autonomous household.\nThe state can pay women directly via family allowances or other transfers.\nAlthough these enhance women\u2019s relative power, they discourage her employment\npolicy pathways to gender power 5\nFigure 1. Policy effects on women\u2019s relative resources and division of housework.\ndue to income effects (Jaumotte, 2003), a negative relationship indicated by the\ndotted line in Figure 1. The availability of transfers, however, enables women with\nlower earnings to establish an autonomous household in the event of divorce,\nthereby minimising class differences among women and strengthening lower-\nincome women\u2019s bargaining position in the family. Generally, female-headed\nhouseholds are worse off than male-headed households across industrialised\ncountries, but the amount of transfers improves the situation for single female\nheads of household greatly in France, Germany and Italy as compared with the\nUnited States (Daly and Rake, 2003). Dewilde (2002) compares the financial\neffects of relationship dissolution for women across Denmark, the United\nKingdom, Belgium, Germany and Italy, concluding that the availability of both\nthe labour market and welfare state transfers varies women\u2019s ability to maintain\nautonomous households. Policy also shapes women\u2019s ability to establish an\nautonomous household through laws governing the division of marital assets\nand post-marital payments such as maintenance and child support. Following\ncouples over time, DiPrete and McManus (2000) find the German welfare state\nmore effective than that in the United States at reducing the gender gap in the\nfinancial impact of a marital dissolution.\nWhile the relative gender power model provides a framework for predicting\nthe gendered division of household labour across countries, comparative work\ninherently includes unmeasured cultural or other differences, confounding\nreliability and interpretation of results. In addition, the analytic focus to date\n6 lynn prince cooke\nhas been nation-state differences, when in fact women have much more political\ninfluence at the local level (Lister, 2003). Within the federalist system of the United\nStates, there has historically been state-level variation in key factors affecting\nwomen\u2019s employment and claims as mothers (Skocpol, 1992). Consequently, the\nUnited States offers a natural experiment for assessing whether this variation\nalters relative gender power in the family and the division of household tasks.\nPossible cultural differences are not eliminated using a within-country study, but\nare arguably less acute. In addition, possible cultural or other unmeasured effects\nat the state level will be controlled for in the models.\nUS policy effects on relative gender power\nWhile most individual-level analyses define relative resources in terms of\na woman\u2019s age, education and labour market earnings, also important to\nhouseholds is the private income from dividends, assets, pensions and the like.\nFurther, even though public transfer payments in the United States such as\nunemployment assistance or Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF)\nmight be modest, their relative importance within the poorer households that\nqualify for them should not be ignored. The first extension of the relative resource\nmodel tested here predicts that the greater women\u2019s share of private non-labour or\ntransfer income relative to the family income, the greater men\u2019s share of domestic\ntasks.\nStates vary in the available economic alternatives to the marriage or\nrelationship. For example, in the event of a separation, women employed at\ngood wages enjoy better prospects than unemployed women or women with\nlow wages. Women as a group, however, historically suffer from a greater risk\nof poverty (Daly, 1992). This suggests that the general economic environment in\nwhich a couple resides has a greater effect on women\u2019s relative power, and leads\nto the second hypothesis that the greater the state poverty rate, the smaller men\u2019s\nshare of domestic tasks.\nUS states also vary in laws governing the distribution of marital property in\nthe event of a divorce. Nine states \u2013 Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada,\nNew Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin \u2013 are community property states,\nin which marital property is divided equally upon divorce, regardless of which\npartner\u2019s earnings led to its accumulation. In nearly all the remaining states, the\ncourt determines an \u2018equitable\u2019 division, which in a male breadwinner family\nwould tend to favour the husband. Community property provisions nullify\nthe detrimental relative power stemming from the gender wage gap or fewer\naccumulated years of work experience typical of women\u2019s careers if they exit the\nlabour market during marriage. This enhances women\u2019s non-marital alternatives\nand leads to the third hypothesis that when couples reside in a community\nproperty state, men will perform a greater share of domestic tasks.\npolicy pathways to gender power 7\nThe amount and likelihood of receiving child support also varies by state\n(Pirog et al., 1998). Historically, local judges decided whether a non-resident\nparent should pay child support; if so, how much; and what actions should be\ntaken in the event of default. Thus, awards, amounts and enforcement all varied,\nwith the burden of collecting unpaid support falling on the custodial parent.\nAll processes and amendments within this system required the services of an\nattorney, so outcomes varied by socio-economic class and the financial resources\nof each parent, which generally favoured men.\nThe rapid rise in divorce rates and out-of-wedlock births during the 1960s\nand 1970s led to a dramatic increase in public expenditure on welfare benefits\nto mothers and children (Garfinkel and McLanahan, 1986), in part because\nfathers, particularly lower-income fathers, were not paying child support. As\nof the late 1970s, only 60 per cent of eligible single parents had a legal child\nsupport arrangement and, of those, only about one-half received the full amount\ndue, one-fourth received only a portion of what was due, and another fourth\nreceived nothing (Garfinkel et al., 1998).\nIn response to the rising federal welfare expense, Congress passed the 1974\nChild Support Enforcement Act, requiring all states to establish comparable\nstate offices and authorising federal funding for child support enforcement,\nprimarily for cases where the mother was on public assistance. By 1980, federal\nsupport for child support enforcement extended to all eligible children regardless\nof income or welfare status. The 1984 amendments required states to adopt\nchild support guidelines to determine obligation levels, withhold child support\nobligations from wages and other income of non-resident parents who were\nmore than one month in arrears, and create procedures for placing liens against Q1\nproperty for delinquent obligors. The 1988 Family Support Act made numeric\nsupport guidelines presumptive, in that departing from them required written\njustification. The 1988 Act also required automatic withholding of child support\nfor families receiving welfare benefits as of 1990, and for all cases as of 1994. As\npart of welfare reform in the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity\nReconciliation Act, child support collection became coordinated across state\nlines, and states were required to develop procedures for revoking the drivers\u2019\nand professional licenses of delinquent obligors.\nEvidence indicates that more stringent enforcement results in greater\ncompliance (Meyer and Bartfeld, 1996). Therefore, where child support\nenforcement proves effective, the likelihood of obtaining any future child support\nin the event of a divorce increases, enhancing a woman\u2019s relative power within the\nmarriage in two ways. First, it improves her non-marital economic alternatives,\nwhile simultaneously reducing the man\u2019s relative resources since he is the source\nof the support payment. Yet despite the efforts at national coordination, state\nOffices of Child Support Enforcement vary dramatically in their effectiveness.\nIn 2000, the percentage of applicable cases with court orders for child support\n8 lynn prince cooke\nranged from a low of 26 per cent in New Mexico and the District of Columbia,\nto a high of 93 per cent in South Dakota (US Department of Health and Human\nServices, 2002). Average collection per case also ranged greatly, from a low of $299\nin the District of Columbia to a high of $2,083 in Minnesota (US Department of\nHealth and Human Services, 2002). This leads to the final hypothesis, that the\ngreater the Office of Child Support Enforcement collections, the greater men\u2019s\nshare of domestic tasks.\nData and methods\nData are drawn from Wave 2 of the National Survey of Families and Households\n(NSFH2), fielded between 1992 and 1994 (Sweet and Bumpass, 1996). A more\nrecent wave has been fielded, but the geographic coding of households necessary\nfor assessing state-level effects is unlikely to be conducted.1 The NSFH began\nin 1987 with a national probability sample of 13007 households with an over-\nsampling of some ethnic minorities and family forms. For Wave 2 (NSFH2),\n10,007 of the original families were re-sampled, with new spouses and partners\nadded to the database. From Wave 2, all households where the primary respondent\nis either married or cohabiting are selected and merged with partner data where\nboth partners provide information. This yields an unweighted sample of 5,371\ncouples (5,595 when the person weight was applied to the main respondent).\nUnweighted data are used for analyses, although applying the weights does not\nsubstantively alter results. A review of the state distribution of the sample reveals\nthat it is generally representative of the US population distribution. California,\nTexas and New York are the most populous states (representing 12, 7 and 7 per\ncent of the population, respectively), while Vermont and Wyoming are the least\npopulated, with just 0.2 per cent in each.\nMen\u2019s share of domestic tasks is regressed using ordinary least squares on an\narray of relative resource and control variables. In order to control for possible\nunmeasured cultural or other factors associated with residing in a given state\nthat might affect results, analyses were run clustering on state to provide robust\nstandard errors. Doing so increased rather than decreased the significance of the\npolicy-related factors, although effects of some other variables such as husband\u2019s\neducation were no longer statistically significant.\nThe NSFH contains questions asking each person how many hours per\nweek are spent performing nine tasks: preparing meals, doing dishes, housework,\nlaundry, shopping, yard work, automotive maintenance, paying bills and driving.\nFactor analyses (results available from author) reveal that for both women and\nmen, all tasks but driving load on one of two factors: meals, dishes, housework,\nshopping and laundry, comprising a factor of traditional female domestic tasks;\nand yard work, automotive maintenance and bill paying, comprising a factor of\ntraditional male domestic tasks. The first tasks are deemed female because they\npolicy pathways to gender power 9\nform the daily chores that cannot be scheduled at one\u2019s convenience, whereas\nbill-paying or yard work can be slotted into available time and have historically\nbeen the purview of men (Fenstermaker Berk, 1985; Goldscheider and Waite, 1991;\nShelton and John, 1996). To the extent performing domestic tasks reflects relative\npower, with the more powerful partner able to negotiate the most favourable\nactivities, relative resource effects are assessed on the division of female tasks.\nIt should be noted, however, that in the sample men\u2019s share of female tasks\ncorrelates with their share of male tasks, and model effects were substantively the\nsame albeit weaker when using all domestic tasks.\nThe dependent variable is calculated as men\u2019s percentage share of the total\nhousehold time spent in meal preparation, doing dishes, performing housework,\nshopping and doing laundry. Since evidence indicates that any increase in men\u2019s\nshare of these tasks has primarily been the result of women decreasing their own\ndomestic hours, a control is included for women\u2019s reported hours in these same\ntasks. This also allows us to see whether significant variable effects on men\u2019s\nshare of female domestic tasks result primarily from women\u2019s alteration of their\ndomestic time, or men\u2019s.\nRelative resource variables\nTraditional relative resource measures include age, education and earnings\n(Shelton and John, 1996). The effect of women\u2019s relative age, however, is\nambiguous. On the one hand, greater age relative to one\u2019s partner reflects more\nworld and work experience and should therefore increase relative power. On the\nother, in many industrialised societies, youth and beauty remain highly valued\ncharacteristics of women (Parsons, 1942), so being older than one\u2019s partner may\nin fact reduce women\u2019s relative power. Also, retired men possess more available\ntime to participate in domestic tasks that might mask competing age effects for\nyounger men who may have more egalitarian divisions. To ascertain each of these\npossible effects, five age measures are created: four indicator variables for male\ncohorts (men aged 35 or less, 35 to 45, 55 to 65, and older than 65, against a referent\nof men aged 45 to 55) and an indicator variable for when the woman is older than\nthe man, against a referent of being his age or younger.\nSome empirical evidence of education effects indicates that in the United\nStates men\u2019s education level is positively associated with domestic participation\n(Brines, 1993; South and Spitze, 1994), whereas studies of other countries find no\nassociation (McAllister, 1990), or that the effect disappears once gender ideology\nis included (Kamo, 1994). Women\u2019s greater educational attainment predicts less\ntime in domestic tasks, but after controlling for possible earnings, a woman\u2019s\neducation effect seems to be on her gender ideology (Shelton and John, 1996).\nTo assess the absolute and relative effect of education when predicting men\u2019s\nshare of domestic tasks, three measures are created. First is the man\u2019s years of\neducation, the second his years of education squared to ascertain whether men\u2019s\n10 lynn prince cooke\nshare of domestic tasks changes at higher levels of educational attainment, and\nthe third is an indicator variable for when the woman has completed more years\nof education than the man. A control for gender ideology will be included in the\nmodel as discussed below.\nThe third traditional source of power stems from relative economic resources,\ndefined most frequently in terms of relative earnings. Women\u2019s labour earnings,\nincluding those from self-employment, as a percentage of the couple\u2019s total\nlabour plus self-employment earnings comprise the first measure of relative\neconomic resources. Women\u2019s earnings should be positively associated with\nmen\u2019s share of female domestic tasks. A squared term for women\u2019s earnings\nis also included to ascertain whether couples are more likely to compensate\nin the private sphere as women become primary breadwinners, such as found\nby Brines (1994) and Bittman et al. (2003). An indicator variable controls for\nhusbands who are out of the labour market, which includes unemployment or\nretirement. The time availability model predicts such men would perform more\ntasks as found by Bianchi and her colleagues (2000), but others have found even\nmore compensation in the domestic sphere in the US when wives are the sole\nbreadwinner (Brines, 1994; Bittman et al., 2003).\nFive additional measures capture a greater range of relative economic\nresources hypothesised here also to alter men\u2019s domestic behaviour. Women\u2019s\nnon-transfer, non-labour income, expressed as a percentage of the couple\u2019s total\nincome, captures effects of dividends, assets and pensions. Women\u2019s transfer\nincome as a percentage of total couple income forms the second measure, which\nincludes public assistance, child support and other government income excluding\nsocial security. While child support is a private transfer, the amount is regulated\nby federal guidelines and, unlike non-transfer, non-labour income, does not\nderive from prior economic activity. If the first hypothesis is supported, both of\nthese additional income effects should be positively associated with men\u2019s share\nof female domestic tasks.\nThe state poverty rate for 1992 as published by the US Census Bureau (1992)\ncomprises the third measure. The fourth measure is an indicator variable for when\na couple resides in one of the community property states (Arizona, California,\nIdaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington or Wisconsin). The\nfifth measure is the state\u2019s 1992 Child Support Enforcement Office collections\n(in millions) to ascertain whether the potential to collect future child support\nincreases men\u2019s share of domestic tasks. In 1992, slightly more than half of\nstate child support collections were for women receiving Aid to Families with\nDependent Children, the forerunner to TANF (US Department of Health\nand Human Services, 1996), although the proportion of clients not on public\nassistance utilising CSE services has increased dramatically since that time (US\nDepartment of Health and Human Services, 2002).\npolicy pathways to gender power 11\nControl variables\nControl variables include the log of total household income, number of\nchildren, home ownership, gender ideology, ethnicity and cohabitation. The log\nof total household income controls for the possibility that relative resource effects\nmay vary depending upon total household resources. Since housework increases\nwith the presence of younger children, the child measure reflects the total number\nof children under the age of sixteen in the household. An indicator variable for\nwhen couples own their home, against a referent of renting, is also included, as\nhome ownership is associated with more hours in both male and female domestic\ntasks (Fenstermaker Berk, 1985; South and Spitze, 1994).\nMore traditional gender ideology predicts more traditional divisions of\ndomestic tasks across countries (Baxter, 1997; Fuwa, 2004; Breen and Cooke,\n2005). The NSFH2 asks both primary respondents and their partners questions\nregarding attitudes about women\u2019s employment and its effects on children, single\nparenthood, divorce and related topics. Factor analysis of all of the attitude\nquestions yields several factors, with more non-traditional attitudes predicting\nhusband\u2019s greater share of domestic tasks. Since effects are consistent regardless\nof measure, the question most central to the research question is selected here: \u2018A\nhusband whose wife is working full-time should spend just as many hours doing\nhousework as his wife.\u2019 It is recoded so that 1 is \u2018strongly disagree\u2019 to reflect the\nbelief that women should retain responsibility for domestic tasks, to 5, \u2018strongly\nagree\u2019, reflecting an egalitarian attitude.\nTwo indicator variables for ethnicity are included, one for when the primary\nrespondent is Black, and one if Hispanic. Some evidence indicates Black men\nparticipate more (Shelton and John, 1996), particularly in female tasks (Orbuch\nand Eyster, 1997), while others have found no significant effect (Bianchi et al.,\n2000), or that part of the difference stems from Black women\u2019s fewer housework\nhours as compared with Caucasian women (Brines, 1993). Evidence for Hispanic\nhouseholds is also mixed (Shelton and John, 1996).\nAn indicator variable is created for cohabiters, since cross-national studies\nfind that cohabiting couples have more egalitarian divisions of housework than\nmarried couples (Batalova and Cohen, 2002). In terms of US policy effects\nmeasured here, however, these couples fall under contract rather than family\nlaw, and the Office of Support Enforcement\u2019s ability to establish paternity among\nnon-married couples in order to file child support claims has proven very weak.\nSeparate analyses (not shown) confirm that among the policy-related factors,\nonly the poverty rate is as significant among cohabiters as for married couples.\nResults\nTable 1 displays the descriptive statistics of the sample.

The second model\nincludes transfers and state-varying variables. Women\u2019s domestic hours are added\nin the final model to ascertain whether observed effects result from an increase\nin men\u2019s share of domestic tasks, or a decrease in women\u2019s hours. The change in\nthe F statistic across the models supports that the inclusion of each additional set\nof variables significantly improves the fit of the model.\nIn the first model, the traditional relative resource measures are all significant\nand in the expected direction. There is evidence of life-cycle and cohort effects\namong men. As compared with the referent age group of men 45 to 55, younger\nmen perform a significantly greater share of female tasks after controlling for\neffects of remaining variables such as employment and children, with men\u2019s share\ngreater the younger they are. This suggests successive generations are evolving\nto be more egalitarian in the division of household tasks, although longitudinal\ndata are necessary to follow these men over time to confirm this. Men older than\n65 do not take on a significantly greater share, but this stems from including the\nindicator variable for when men are out of the labour force, which includes both\nthe unemployed and retirees. When this indicator is removed, the share of female\ntasks among men older than 65 is over two percentage points greater as compared\nwith the referent age group, or roughly equivalent to the youngest cohort of\nmen. The indicator variable for a woman being older than her male partner is\ninsignificant, so neither relative youth nor experience appears to contribute to\nwomen\u2019s relative power.\nThe main effect of men\u2019s years of education is negative but statistically\ninsignificant, while the education-squared term is positive and significant,\nindicating that men with higher levels of educational attainment perform a\nlarger share of female domestic tasks. Controlling for this, when women have\nmore education than their partners, men perform over two percentage points\nmore female domestic tasks.\nEach percentage point increase in a woman\u2019s relative earnings predicts men\nwill perform about one-third of a percentage point more of female tasks. The\neffect attenuates as women become the primary breadwinner, since the earnings-\nsquared term is negative and also statistically significant. So in addition to the\nexchange of women\u2019s relative earnings to men\u2019s relative housework not being\none to one, the effect of women\u2019s earnings deteriorates the more important\nher income is to the family. The effect of women\u2019s non-transfer, non-labour\nincome, while in the expected direction, is not statistically significant, so these\nparticular economic resources have no effect on the division of household labour.\nControlling for these economic effects, unemployed and retired men perform\nover six percentage points more of the domestic tasks: a positive effect also found\nby Bianchi et al. (2000) but not by Brines (1994). This effect again, however,\nsuggests a less than equitable exchange of men\u2019s relative domestic share for\nwomen\u2019s relative economic contribution.\npolicy pathways to gender power 15\nThe second model adds the policy factors to the relative resources of Model 1,\nwith the latter effects remaining substantively the same. In contrast to effects\nof women\u2019s non-transfer income, women\u2019s transfer income predicts men will\nperform a greater share of domestic tasks. Both the mean and the variance of the\nnon-transfer income are greater than for transfer income, so it is not a matter of\nrestricted range stifling effects for the additional private income. Further, more\nwomen report receiving non-labour, non-transfer income (n = 924) than transfer\nincome (n = 615). Consequently, although not all non-labour income positively\naffects women\u2019s relative power, transfer income among couples at lower income\nlevels is important in encouraging greater gender equality in domestic roles. The\neffect of the log of total household income declines in magnitude between Model\n1 and Model 2, so this interpretation appears plausible.\nAll state-varying effects are significant. Increases in the state poverty rate\nsignificantly decrease men\u2019s share of domestic tasks as predicted under the\nsecond hypothesis. The magnitude of the effect is nearly identical to that for\nwomen\u2019s relative earnings, highlighting the importance of the macro-economic\nenvironment to women\u2019s relative power in the family. Men in couples residing\nin community property states perform a greater share of female domestic tasks,\nalthough the magnitude is modest and the effect just marginally significant.\nEffective child support enforcement significantly increases women\u2019s relative\npower; the difference between the lowest and highest state collection rates\naccounts for a two percentage point difference in men\u2019s share of female domestic\ntasks.\nThe final model illuminates whether changes in men\u2019s share of household\ntasks result from women\u2019s or men\u2019s behaviour. With the exception of the effect\nof transfer income and ethnicity, it is clear that some of men\u2019s increasing share\nis the result of women decreasing their domestic hours, because the magnitude\nof effects between Models 2 and 3 declines. The positive effects of being in the\nyoungest male cohorts, men\u2019s greater education, women\u2019s relative education, men\nout of the labour force, women\u2019s relative earnings, women\u2019s gender ideology and\nthe state child support enforcement collections attenuate somewhat, indicating\nthat under these conditions part of the effect derives from women reducing their\nhousework hours. The effect for men with greater education becomes statistically\ninsignificant, suggesting that all of this observed effect derives from the fact that\nwives of more educated men spend less time in domestic tasks. The negative state\npoverty rate effect diminishes in magnitude, indicating that in states with lower\npoverty rates, women spend less time in domestic tasks.\nIn contrast, the effect of transfer income increases in both magnitude\nand statistical significance, indicating that its effect on relative gender power\nis absolute. Results also indicate that Black men\u2019s greater share of domestic\ntasks derives from Black women\u2019s fewer domestic hours when controlling for the\nremaining variables, as well as from Black men\u2019s greater participation, because\n16 lynn prince cooke\nthe positive effect increases between Models 2 and 3. These results confirm what\npreviously has been interpreted as conflicting evidence (Brines, 1993; Orbuch and\nEyster, 1997).\nFigure 2 displays the combined effects of significant variables on men\u2019s\npredicted share of female domestic tasks under three scenarios. The first is\nthe traditional relative resource scenario, represented by the black circle line,\npredicting his share of female domestic tasks for a man aged 45 to 55 with less\nthan a university degree, setting ideology scores and the state poverty rate at their\nmeans from Table 1, and varying women\u2019s relative earnings along with its square.\nThis illustrates that men\u2019s predicted share of female tasks using traditional relative\nresource measures ranges from just 15 per cent when the wife is not employed, to\nabout one-quarter in remaining households, slightly less than the cross-national\naverages reported by Gershuny (2000). The compensatory housework division\nfound by Brines (1994) and Bittman et al. (2003) is also evident: as women\u2019s\nrelative earnings exceed 60 per cent, men\u2019s housework share declines.\nThe second scenario, represented by the grey diamond line, includes the\nindividual resource variables while maximising the policy and state-varying\neffects. The poverty rate is set to its minimum (7.6) rather than its mean (14.3),\nwomen\u2019s transfer income is set at 10 per cent of the household\u2019s total income,\nand the couple resides in a community property state and one collecting the\nmaximum 1992 child support ($783million). Under this scenario, men\u2019s predicted\nshare of domestic tasks increases by approximately ten percentage points over\nthe traditional relative resource scenario, or by more than 33 per cent. Again,\nhowever, his share is predicted to decline once women\u2019s relative earnings exceed\n60 per cent.\nThe third scenario, represented by the dark grey square line, replicates the\nsecond scenario but adjusts effects for women\u2019s domestic hours as in Model 3 of\nTable 2. Doing so eliminates evidence of the compensatory division as women\u2019s\nrelative earnings increase, because such women reduce their total housework\nhours. When US women are the sole breadwinner, however, they still perform\nmore than half of the female domestic tasks. On the other hand, as evident at\nthe other end of earning continuum, in male breadwinner households men are\npredicted to perform more than one-quarter of the female domestic tasks once\nwe adjust for women\u2019s actual hours. This more egalitarian housework sharing\namong male breadwinner families is consistent with Gershuny\u2019s (2000) findings\nthat unemployed, not employed, women have decreased their domestic hours\nthe most.\nDiscussion and conclusions\nFeminists argue that the state reinforces patriarchy as evident in the continued\ngendered division of domestic tasks (Hartmann, 1981; Blumberg, 1984).

Men\u2019s Predicted Share of Female Domestic Tasks, With and Without State-Level Effects.\n18 lynn prince cooke\nhere is the first study of specific policy effects on women\u2019s relative gender power\nand the division of housework, comparing US interstate variation in both. Policy\nalters relative gender power directly through women\u2019s access to education and\nemployment, as well as indirectly through its shaping of women\u2019s alternatives to\na marriage in terms of the macro-economic environment, state transfers, child\nsupport and family law. The evidence supports that each of these pathways to\ngender power proves important to predicting the division of household tasks,\nalthough, even under the best scenario, women\u2019s responsibility for the domestic\nsphere persists.\nGenerally, successive generations of US men appear to be evolving to be more\negalitarian, although longitudinal data are necessary to confirm this. The effects\nof some individual resources also appear to be strengthening. Women\u2019s education\nrelative to her partner\u2019s predicts a more significant shift than men\u2019s educational\nattainment. This finding suggests that women\u2019s increasing educational attainment\nacross industrialised societies enhances gender equity not only in employment\nand earnings (OECD, 2004), but in the domestic sphere as well after controlling\nfor employment effects. Consequently, Figure 1needs to be amended to reflect that\neducation directly affects women\u2019s relative power. Future research might explore\nwhether the content of education bestows greater equity, such as when women\nobtain degrees in traditionally male-dominated fields such as engineering, or if\nits power derives solely from attainment levels.\nGiven that US policy generally remains silent on the private sphere, the\npolicy effects might be of greater interest to policy makers elsewhere actively\nseeking to enhance gender equity. First, the macro-economic environment has\ngreater repercussions for women\u2019s relative power given their greater economic\nvulnerability. In US states with lower poverty rates, men do a greater share of\ndomestic tasks. In states with higher poverty rates, women spend more hours in\ndomestic work. Since individual earnings and household income are controlled\nfor in the model, it is possible that this effect reflects that in more impoverished\nareas, less household production can be commodified through pre-packaged\nmeals, household appliances, restaurants, cleaning services and so on. This might\nalso explain women\u2019s greater responsibility for domestic tasks in transitional\neconomies than predicted by their high labour force participation rates (Fuwa,\n2004).\nRelated to this are the significant effects found for women\u2019s transfer income.\nThe evidence here supports that public transfers among economically vulnerable\ncouples encourage greater equity in the home so that the possibility of equity\nis not just a privilege of middle and upper class women. As in other liberal\nregimes, US transfers are meagre, so future research might assess their effect\non the domestic division of labour in countries with more generous transfer\nstructures but different institutional arrangements of gender relations, such as\nSweden, Germany and the Netherlands.\npolicy pathways to gender power 19\nDivorce law can enhance gender equity within existing marriages. US\ncommunity property laws, by guaranteeing an even distribution of marital assets\nin the event of a divorce, equalise the historical gender disparities in wages and\naccrued work experience. The evidence here is that these laws have modest effects\non the division of housework. The magnitude of the effect might reflect that,\nover time, the proportion of US dual-earner couples has grown substantially\nso that now, more than two-thirds of the married women in the sample are\nemployed and US states without community property laws have increasingly\ndivided marital assets more equally. On the other hand, during the past decades\ncourts across countries with lower levels of married female employment, such as\nItaly, have increasingly denied women alimony in the event of a divorce, while\nseldom crediting women\u2019s time spent caring as equivalent to men\u2019s time spent\nin employment (Saraceno, 1994). So although the US effect might be small,\nthe potential impact of similar laws in other countries might be substantially\ngreater.\nMore effective child support enforcement also encourages gender equity\nwithin marriage. The difference between the lowest and highest US collection\nrates accounts for a two percentage point difference in men\u2019s share of female\ndomestic tasks, or the same relative power effect as when women have more\neducation than men or when the man is retired. The effectiveness of child support\nenforcement across countries is abysmal. Even after the extensive US efforts to\ncoordinate child support across states, there is little improvement since 1983 in\nthe proportion of custodial parents with legal agreements or who receive the full\npayment (US Census Bureau, 2000). Phipps and Burton (1995) found that in the\nmid-eighties, only Sweden guaranteed single mothers\u2019 receipt of child support,\nbut that support comprised just 13 per cent of mean income. The Netherlands\nhad the highest mean level of support, but only 10 per cent of mothers received\nit (Phipps and Burton, 1995: 160). The setting and enforcement of child support\nprovisions appear to be areas where the state can make significant progress not\nonly on enhancing women\u2019s ability to establish an autonomous household, but\nalso on gender equity within marital households.\nTaken together, the US policy effects modelled here can increase men\u2019s\nshare of female domestic tasks by more than ten percentage points, representing\nsubstantially greater equality in domestic gender roles than predicted by\nindividual resources. This difference is equivalent to the difference between the\ngendered division of domestic tasks in Italy versus Norway, or the Netherlands\nversus Sweden, as calculated from Gershuny\u2019s (2000) detailed time data for the\neighties. Calculating men\u2019s share from Fuwa\u2019s (2004: 757) nineties data, the US\ncross-state difference is equivalent to the difference in the division of domestic\ntasks in Japan with the most traditional division, versus the formerly socialist\nCzech Republic, or the Czech Republic versus Sweden or Canada. That the within-\ncountry policy variation is as large across such diverse welfare and gender regimes\n20 lynn prince cooke\nis remarkable, and underscores how policies can ameliorate gender inequality\nwithin and outside of the home.\nAcknowledgements\nMany thanks to Mary Daly, Joya Misra, Judy Selzer and two anonymous JSP reviewers for\nhelpful comments on earlier drafts of this paper.\nNote\n1 A similar analysis was conducted using longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income\nDynamics for couples marrying between 1985 and 1995 that confirms effects found here,\nalthough that study is not reported given the weakness in the measure of housework. The\nmale of the household is asked to estimate the hours spent each week in housework broadly\ndefined for both himself and any partner. In one year when both partners were asked, the\nman\u2019s estimate proved to be rather inaccurate. Consequently, the NSFH is preferred given\nthe reports from each partner and extensiveness of the housework items queried.\nReferences\nBatalova, J. A. and Cohen, P. N.
