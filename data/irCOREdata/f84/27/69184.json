Introduction\n[2] CME-driven and CIR-driven geomagnetic events dif-\nfer, with the various forms of geomagnetic activity (ring\ncurrent, aurora, convection, radiation belts, . . .) being man-\nifested to different degrees in the two types of storms. In this\npaper a systematic comparison between the properties of\nCME-driven storms and CIR-driven storms is summarized.\nAs will be seen, there are a large number of differences.\n[3] It is not surprising that the two types of geomagnetic\nstorms differ because the two types of drivers differ.\nGeomagnetic activity is chiefly driven by the value of vBs\nof the solar wind [e.g., Bargatze et al., 1986], where v is the\nsolar wind speed and Bs is the southward component of the\ninterplanetary magnetic field (in GSM coordinates). For\nCME drivers and CIR drivers, many things differ: the\nstrength and morphology of the magnetic field, the temporal\nprofile of the velocity v, the durations of the vBs drivers, the\npresence of shocks, . . . [e.g., Gonzalez et al., 1999].\nCoronal mass ejections (CMEs) are preceded in time by a\nsheath of compressed solar wind, which itself is often\npreceded by an interplanetary shock. The strong magnetic\nfield of the sheath can drive storms as well as can a strong\nmagnetic field in the ejecta, and the interplanetary shock can\nadd phenomenology to the geomagnetic storm on Earth.\nAdditionally, the ejecta may contain a magnetic cloud. In\nthis paper, CME-driven storms will refer to storms driven\nby all or some of the various components: shock, sheath,\nejecta, and cloud. Corotating interaction regions (CIRs) are\nfollowed in time by high-speed streams. Either the CIR or\nthe high-speed stream or both can be drivers of storms. In\nthis paper, CIR-driven storms refers to storms driven by\neither or both the CIR and the stream.\n[4] The occurrence rate of CMEs peaks strongly during\nsolar maximum [Webb, 1991; Yashiro et al., 2004], so\nstorms during solar maximum tend to be CME-driven\nstorms [Richardson et al., 2001]. The occurrence rate of\nwell-formed CIR (with 27-day recurrence) peaks during the\nlate declining phase of the solar cycle [Mursula and Zeiger,\n1996], so storms in the declining phase tend to be CIR\ndriven [Richardson et al., 2001]. Note that interaction\nregions (IRs) produced by nonrecurrent high-speed streams\ncan occur throughout the solar cycle [Bobrov, 1983; L. Jian,\nprivate communication, 2005] and can drive nonrecurring\ngeomagnetic activity throughout the solar cycle [Richardson\net al., 2000], although the geomagnetic events that they\ndrive are weaker than the recurring events of the declining\nphase [Bobrov, 1983].\n[5] This study is a follow on to the multispacecraft study\nof Denton et al. [2006] which separately examined the\nmagnetosphere\u2019s reaction to the passage of CMEs and CIRs.\nIn that study, superposed epoch intervals of various quan-\ntities measured by spacecraft in the magnetosphere were\nconstructed using the peak negative Dst as the zero epoch.\nSix of the differences listed in Table 1 are findings of the\nDenton et al. superposed epoch study. The Denton et al.\n[2006] study is itself a follow-up to a Denton et al. [2005]\nstudy in which the magnetospheric evolution during 283\ngeomagnetic storms was examined.\n[6] The differences between CME-driven storms and\nCIR-driven storms are collected into Table 1. The differ-\nences are discussed individually in section 2.

The findings\nare summarized in section 4.\n2. Differences\n[7] The differences between CME-driven storms and\nCIR-driven storms are collected into Table 1. The category\n\u2018\u2018CME-driven\u2019\u2019 includes driving by ejecta, CME sheaths,\nand magnetic clouds. The category \u2018\u2018CIR-driven\u2019\u2019 also\nincludes driving by the high-speed-stream that follows the\nCIR. Each row of Table 1 is described in detail in the\nvarious subsections of this section. For some storm proper-\nties, the differences between CME-driven storms and CIR-\ndriven storms are well known and the appropriate literature\nis pointed out. For other properties, original work is done\nhere to discern the differences.\n2.1. Phase of the Solar Cycle\n[8] It is well known that CIR-driven storms generally\noccur in the late declining phase of the solar cycle and\nthat CME-driven storms tend to occur at solar maximum\n[Gonzalez et al., 1999; Yermolaev and Yermolaev, 2002;\nRichardson et al., 2001, 2002]. There are exceptions to this\ngeneral trend. CMEs occur throughout the solar cycle, but\ntheir occurrence frequencies and their velocities are both\ngreatest during solar maximum [Webb and Howard, 1994;\nIvanov and Obridko, 2001; Gopalswamy et al., 2004]. Also,\n27-day-recurring high-speed streams can also occur in phases\nof the solar cycle other than the declining phase. Additionally,\ninteraction regions (IRs) that are not 27-day recurring\noccur throughout the solar cycle [Bobrov, 1983; Richardson\net al., 2000], although their geomagnetic effectiveness is\nweaker on average than is the geoeffectiveness of CIRs.\n2.2. Occurrence Rate\n[9] CIRs (corotating interaction regions), when they oc-\ncur, pass the Earth every \u000127 days owing to the rotation of\nthe Sun. During the declining phase of the solar cycle,\ncoronal hole structure on the solar surface is long-lived and\nsimple, and as a result 27-day-recurring high-speed-stream-\ndriven storms are often found. This is shown in Figure 1a.\nHere the Kp index is used to create a storm occurrence\ndatabase. The Kp index is broken into 27.27-day-long\nintervals, one interval for each rotation of the Sun. The\ndata is then plotted as the day during the 27.27-day-long\ninterval (horizontal) versus the fractional year (vertical).\nThe timelines are the thin black lines. Time intervals when\nKp \u0002 4+ are plotted as large black squares. 27-day repeating\nstorms appear as the vertical clusters of black points.\nSeveral of these storm groups can be seen in 1993\u20131995\nduring the declining phase. Another group can be seen\nin late 1999 and early 2000. The storms are replotted in\nFigure 1b without the timeline. The McPherron online\ncatalog (R. McPherron, private communication, 2005)\n(www.igpp.ucla.edu\/public\/rmcpherr\/CDAWEventLists\/) of\nCIR stream interfaces at Earth for January 1994 through\nDecember 1996 is used to produce the yellow points in\nFigure 1b. As can be seen by their association with CIRs, the\ngroups of periodic storms in Figure 1a are high-speed-\nstream-driven storms (CIR-driven storms). As can be seen\nin Figure 1a, throughout the solar cycle other storms occur\nrandomly. The occurrence frequency of these random\nstorms is higher in the 2000\u20132002 solar maximum years.\nPlotted in purple in Figure 1b are times when CMEs are\npassing the Earth (the Cane and Richardson catalog [Cane\nand Richardson, 2003]) and plotted in yellow are times when\nmagnetic clouds are passing the Earth (the Lepping online\ncatalog http:\/\/lepmfi.gsfc.nasa.gov\/mfi\/mag_cloud_pub1.\nhtml, see Lepping et al. [2005]). The Cane and Richardson\ncatalog goes from January 1996 through December 2002 and\nthe Lepping catalog goes from February 1995 through\nAugust 2003. As can be seen, the randomly occurring storms\nin Figure 1a are associated with CMEs and with the magnetic\nclouds within CMEs.\nTable 1.

Calm Before the Storm\n[10] Borovsky and Steinberg [2006] found that most\nrecurring high-speed-stream-driven storms have an extended\ninterval (1\u20132 days) of extreme geomagnetic calm (Kp \u0002 1+)\nwithin 24 hours prior to storm onset. These calms before\nthe storms are caused by the same Russell-McPherron effect\nthat produces an increased probability of high-speed-stream-\ndriven-storm occurrence [cf. Crooker and Cliver, 1994;\nMursula and Zeiger, 1996]: owing to a sector reversal just\nupstream of the CIR stream interface, when the IMF in the\nhigh-speed wind is favorable for a storm, the IMF in the\nslow wind is favorable for a calm. A survey of 83 high-\nspeed-stream-driven storms by Borovsky and Steinberg\n[2006] found that 67% of the storms were immediately\npreceded by extended intervals of geomagnetic calm. Using\nthe same analysis techniques, a survey by the present authors\nof 68 CME-driven storms (from the Denton et al. [2006]\ncatalog) finds that only 37% are immediately preceded by\nextended intervals of calm. Hence calms before the storms\nare predominantly a CIR-driven-storm phenomena. Calms\nbefore storms are of note because during the calm intervals\nthe magnetosphere fills with dense plasmaspheric plasma\nand with dense LLBL (low-latitude boundary layer) plasma.\nThe buildup of dense plasma in the magnetosphere can\nchange the nature of a storm, yielding a stronger ring\ncurrent (B. Lavraud et al., Magnetosphere preconditioning\nunder northward IMF: Evidence from the study of CME\nand CIR geoeffectiveness, submitted to Journal of\nGeophysical Research, 2006), initially lower fluxes in the\nouter radiation belts [Borovsky and Steinberg, 2006], and\nperhaps changes to the reconnection rate at the dayside\nneutral line [Borovsky and Steinberg, 2006]. CIR-driven\nstorms are more often preconditioned by calms than are\nCME-driven storms.\nFigure 1. Times of high geomagnetic activity (Kp \u0002 4+) are plotted as the black points on a solar\nrotation versus year plot. In the left panel, the time line is plotted as the thin black lines and the storm\ntimes are plotted as the black boxes. In the right panel the storm times are plotted in black, the Cane and\nRichardson [2003] CME catalog is plotted in purple, the Lepping online magnetic cloud catalog is plotted\nin yellow, and the McPherron CIR-stream-interface catalog is plotted in red.\nA07S08 BOROVSKY AND DENTON: CME STORMS AND CIR STORMS\n3 of 17\nA07S08\n2.4. Solar Energetic-Particle (SEP) Events\n[11] Solar energetic-particle events are enhanced fluxes of\nsubrelativistic and relativistic ions that have durations of\nhours to days. SEP events are well known to be associated\nwith solar flares and with strong interplanetary shocks\ndriven by ejecta from the sun [Reames, 2003]. Flares and\nstrong interplanetary shocks are both phenomena that are\nassociated with CMEs, hence SEP events sometimes ac-\ncompany CME-driven storms. The intensity of SEP events\nis correlated with the velocity of the coronal ejecta driving\nthe shocks [Kahler, 2001]. On rare occasions, SEP events\ncan be large enough to pose a hazard to aircraft passengers\nand electronics [Dyer et al., 2003] and to astronauts in high-\nlatitude orbits [Reames, 1999a]. Energetic-particle events\nare also produced by CIRs (by CIR shocks in the helio-\nsphere beyond \u00012 AU, with the energetic particles traveling\nback to 1 AU) [Reames, 1999b], but their intensity at Earth\nis weak compared with CME-related SEP events [Mason\nand Sanderson, 1999], extending only to \u000120 MeV\/n. In\nFigure 2 it is demonstrated that major SEP events often\naccompany CME-driven storms and are not associated\nwith CIR-driven storms. Here, for the years 1989\u20132003,\nstorms (black boxes) are displayed in a solar-rotation\nversus time plot. The NOAA online SEP-event catalog\n(http:\/\/www.sec.noaa.gov\/ftpdir\/indices\/SPE.txt) is plotted\nas the blue points. These events have integral fluxes of\n>10 MeV protons at geosynchronous orbit that exceed\n10 protons\/cm2\/s\/ster. As can be seen, there are large numb-\ners of SEP events among the storms during the two solar\nmaxima in the figure (the years 1989\u20131992 and 2000\u20132002)\nbut there are no SEP events associated with the 27-day-\nrecurring storm groups in the years 1993\u20131995 nor in the\n27-day-recurring storm group in late 1999\/early 2000. Also\nplotted in pink in Figure 2 is the McPherron catalog of CIR\nstream interfaces for the years 1994\u20131996. As can be seen,\nthere is at most one SEP event that is associated with one of\nthe 74 CIRs in the catalog, and this SEP is flare associated.\n2.5. Storm Sudden Commencement (SSC)\n[12] Most storm sudden commencements are associated\nwith strong interplanetary shocks that compress the magne-\ntosphere [Iucci et al., 1988; Russell et al., 1992]. The strong\nshocks are usually found ahead of fast CMEs. As pointed\nout by Kamide et al. [1998], CIR-driven storms generally\nlack sudden commencements [see also Venkatesan and Zhu,\n1991]. An examination of storms by Taylor et al. [1994]\nsupports the conclusion that SSCs tend to be driven by\nCMEs, with more gradual onsets being driven by high-\nspeed streams. In Figure 3, SSCs (white circles) and storms\n(black boxes) are displayed on a solar rotation versus time\nplot. The SSCs are from the NOAA online SSC catalog\n(http:\/\/www.ngdc.noaa.gov\/stp\/SOLAR\/ftpSSC.html). As\ncan be seen in the figure, SSCs tend to not be associated\nwith the groups of 27-day-recurring storms (cf. the years\n1993, 1994, 1995, and 1999). Also, as can be seen in the\nfigure, SSCs are associated with the randomly occurring\nstorms. To quantify these observations, the Borovsky and\nSteinberg [2006] catalog of high-speed-stream-driven\nstorms is examined and it is found that 21% of those storms\nare temporally associated with SSCs from the NOAA SSC\ncatalog. Forming a CME-driven-storm catalog by requiring\nKp \u0002 4+ in the Cane and Richardson [2003] CME catalog\nand the Lepping online [Lepping et al., 2005] magnetic\ncloud catalog, it is found that 69% of those CME-driven\nstorms are temporally associated with SSCs from the\nNOAA SSC catalog. Hence SSCs are common (\u000170%)\nfor CME-driven storms and infrequent (\u000120%) for CIR-\ndriven storms.\n2.6. Magnetosonic Mach Number of the Solar Wind\n[13] Depending on the values of the Alfven velocity vA =\nB\/(4pnmi)\n1\/2 and ion-acoustic speed Cs = (kB(Ti + Te)\/mi)\n1\/2\nin the solar wind, the magnetosonic Mach number Mms =\nvsw\/(vA\n2 + 5Cs\n2\/3)1\/2 of the solar wind flow relative to the\nFigure 2. Times of high geomagnetic activity (Kp \u0002 4+)\nare plotted as the black points on a solar rotation versus year\nplot. The NOAA online SEP catalog is plotted in blue and\nthe McPherron catalog of CIR stream interfaces for the\nyears 1994\u20131996 is plotted in pink.\nA07S08 BOROVSKY AND DENTON: CME STORMS AND CIR STORMS\n4 of 17\nA07S08\nEarth can change. The magnetosonic Mach number Mms\nsets the properties of the bow shock, which converts\nunshocked solar wind plasma into shocked magnetosheath\nplasma. The magnetosonic Mach number controls the\ncompression ratio C of the shock, which is the multiplica-\ntive density change from upstream to downstream. The\ncompression ratio C varies from 1 (at Mms = 1) to 4 (at\nMms ! 1) [Tidman and Krall, 1971]. In solar wind\/\nmagnetosphere coupling, it is actually the magnetosheath\nflow that drives activity in the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere, and\nthe bow shock converts solar wind flow into magnetosheath\nflow. Typically, the Mach number of the solar wind is high\nand the compression ratio is \u00014. As noted by Lopez et al.\n[2004], during some storms the Mach number of the solar\nwind can be low and the compression ratio of the bow\nshock can be substantially less than 4; in such cases the\nsolar wind\/magnetosphere coupling has a different paramet-\nric dependence on the solar wind than it does in the much\nmore familiar high Mach number case. In the top panel of\nFigure 4 the magnetosonic Mach number Mms of the solar\nwind is binned under various conditions. The electron\ntemperature Te of the solar wind is not measured regularly\nFigure 3. Times of high geomagnetic activity (Kp \u0002 4+)\nare plotted as the black points on a solar rotation versus year\nplot. Times of occurrence of SSCs (storm sudden\ncommencements) at Earth are indicated which white circles.\nThe SSCs occurrence times are from the NOAA online SSC\ncatalog (ht tp: \/ \/www.ngdc.noaa.gov\/s tp\/SOLAR\/\nftpSSC.html).\nFigure 4. (top) For various data sets (as labeled) the\nmagnetosonic Mach number Mms of the solar wind is\nbinned. The Mach number is given by Mms = vsw\/(vA\n2 +\n5Cs\n2\/3)1\/2, where vA = B\n2\/(4pnmi)\n1\/2 and Cs = (kB(Te + Ti)\/\nmi)\n1\/2 are the Alfven and ion-acoustic speeds in the\nupstream solar wind. The median values of Mms are 5.0\nfor the 1963\u20132004 OMNI2 data set, 5.3 for high-speed-\nstream-driven storms, 3.7 for CME-driven storms, and 2.7\nfor the magnetic cloud portions of CME-driven storms.\n(bottom) For various data sets (as labeled) the estimated\ncompression ratio C of the Earth\u2019s bow shock is binned. The\nmedian values of C are 3.65 for the 1963\u20132004 OMNI2\ndata set, 3.69 for high-speed-stream-driven storms, 3.40 for\nCME-driven storms, and 3.01 for the magnetic-cloud\nportions of CME-driven storms.\nA07S08 BOROVSKY AND DENTON: CME STORMS AND CIR STORMS\n5 of 17\nA07S08\nand hence is not available in the OMNI data sets, so to\ncalculate the ion acoustic speed Cs = (kB(Ti + Te)\/mi)\n1\/2 of\nthe solar wind, Te = 1.5 \u0005 105 \u0003K = 12.9 eV is taken, which\nis approximately valid for all types of solar wind [Skoug et\nal., 2000]. All other solar wind parameters are obtained\nfrom the OMNI2 solar wind data set [King and Papitashvili,\n2005]. The dashed curve in Figure 4 is the occurrence\ndistribution of magnetosonic Mach numbers in the entire\n1963\u20132004 OMNI2 data set. The thick gray curve is the\noccurrence distribution for times when high-speed-stream-\ndriven storms are ongoing. The collection of high-speed-\nstream-driven-storm times is the Borovsky and Steinberg\n[2006] catalog of storms driven by 27-day recurring high-\nspeed streams. As can be seen, the Mach numbers during\nhigh-speed-stream-driven storms have a typical distribution\nof values (i.e., similar to OMNI2). The thick black curve in\nFigure 4 is for times when CME-driven storms are ongoing\nand the thin black curve is for times when the magnetic\nclouds are passing during CME-driven storms. The collec-\ntion of CME-driven-storm times is obtained by requiring\nKp \u0002 4+ in the Cane and Richardson [2003] CME catalog\nand the collection of cloud-driven storm times is obtained\nby requiring Kp \u0002 4+ in the Lepping online magnetic cloud\ncatalog [cf. Lepping et al., 2005]. As can be seen, the Mach\nnumbers of the solar wind are anomalously low for CME-\ndriven storms and even lower for the cloud-driven storms.\nIn the bottom panel of Figure 4, the compression ratio C\nacross the bow shock is binned for the same conditions as in\nthe top panel. The compression ratio for the bow shock is\nestimated using the Rankine-Hugoniot shock jump condi-\ntions (equations (1.50) and (1.51) of Tidman and Krall\n[1971]) under the assumption of a quasi-perpendicular\nshock. The dashed curve in the bottom panel is the\noccurrence distribution of C for the entire 1963\u20132004\nOMNI2 data set. As can be seen, the compression ratio C\nis typically near 4. The thick gray curve in the bottom panel\nis the distribution of C values for times when high-speed-\nstream-driven storms are ongoing; as can be seen C is\ntypically near 4 for high-speed-stream-driven storms. The\nthick black curve in the bottom panel is for times when\nCME-driven storms are ongoing and the thin black curve is\nfor the magnetic cloud portions of CME-driven storms. As\ncan be seen, the bow shock compression ratio for CME-\ndriven storms, and particularly for cloud-driven storms, is\nnot near 4. For cloud-driven storms, 26.8% of the time C is\nless than 2.5, which is the midway point between the limits\nof 1 and 4. Because of the systematic difference in the bow\nshock compression ratio, it is expected that the dependence\nof geomagnetic activity on solar wind parameters will differ\nfor CME-driven and high-speed-stream-driven storms.\n2.7. Plasma-B of the Magnetosheath\n[14] For the solar wind parameters that lead to global\nsawtooth oscillations of the magnetosphere, it has been\nnoted that the plasma-b value of the magnetosheath is\nanomalously low [Borovsky, 2004; J. E. Borovsky et al.,\nThe solar-wind driving of global sawtooth oscillations and\nperiodic substorms: What determines the periodicity?, sub-\nmitted to Annales Geophysicae, 2006, hereinafter referred to\nas Borovsky et al., submitted manuscript, 2006], often less\nthan unity. The plasma-b is a measure of how strongly\ndistorted the magnetic field can be owing to diamagnetic\ncurrents in the plasma. b can be defined two ways: a thermal\nb defined as bth = 8pnkB(Ti + Te)\/B\n2 or a ram b defined as\nbram = 4pnmiv\n2\/B2 where v is the plasma flow velocity\n[Parsons and Jellison, 1983; Borovsky, 1992]. bth is a\nmeasure of the currents when a warm plasma is confined\nby a magnetic field; bram is a measure of the currents when a\nplasma flow is deflected or slowed. Although bth \u0006 bram in\nthe magnetosheath plasma, we are specifically interested in\nthe value of bram, which is the ratio of the ram pressure\nnmiv\n2 of a flow to the magnetic-field pressure B2\/8p of\nthe plasma. (Note also that bram = MA\n2 , where MA is here\nthe Alfven Mach number of the magnetosheath flow.) If\nbram < 1, a flow has difficulty distorting magnetic-field\nlines. Ordinarily, in the magnetosheath bram \u0007 1 and the\nflow of the magnetosheath is little impeded by the magnetic\nfield in the magnetosheath. In that case a gasdynamic flow\npicture [e.g., Alksne and Webster, 1970; Spreiter and\nStahara, 1994; Stahara, 2002] is valid with the magnetic\nfield lines passively convected by the magnetosheath flow;\nstrong draping of the field lines over the magnetosphere\nresults. Global MHD simulations of the solar-wind-\ndriven magnetosphere when bram < 1 in the magnetosheath\n[Borovsky et al., 2004] find that the magnetosheath mag-\nnetic field lines are stiff and do not drape; the stiff field lines\nsqueeze the magnetosphere into an unusual flattened shape\nand produce an asymmetric magnetosheath flow pattern that\nis very different from the gasdynamic picture. The bram of\nthe magnetosheath flow can be estimated from upstream\nsolar wind parameters by using the Rankine-Hugoniot\nquasi-perpendicular shock jump conditions. Taking Te =\n12.9 eV for the solar wind (see section 2.6) along with\nmeasured values of v, Ti, B, and n in the solar wind,\nequations (1.50) and (1.51) of Tidman and Krall [1971]\nyield bram values for the magnetosheath plasma. In Figure 5\nFigure 5. For various data sets (as labeled) the plasma-\nbram value of the magnetosheath estimated from the\nRankine-Hugoniot shock-jump conditions and upsteam\nsolar wind parameters is binned. The median values of\nbram for the various distributions are 4.42 for the 1963\u2013\n2004 OMNI2 data set, 4.75 for high-speed-stream-driven\nstorms, 2.29 for storms driven by CMEs, and 1.43 for the\nmagnetic-cloud portions of CME-driven storms.\nA07S08 BOROVSKY AND DENTON: CME STORMS AND CIR STORMS\n6 of 17\nA07S08\nthese bram values are binned for various conditions. The\ndashed curve is the occurrence distribution of bram for the\nentire 1963\u20132004 OMNI2 data set. As can be seen from\nthe OMNI2 curve, bram in the magnetosheath is typically\nhigh. The thick gray curve is for times when high-speed-\nstream-driven storms are ongoing, the thick black curve is for\ntimes when CME-driven storms are ongoing, and the thin\nblack curve is for times when magnetic clouds are passing the\nEarth during storms. As can be seen, for high-speed-stream-\ndriven storms bram is slightly higher than typical. The bram\nvalues for CME-driven storms are anomalously low and the\nbram values for the magnetic cloud portions of CME-driven\nstorms are even lower. For the OMNI2 data set, 0.75% of the\ntime bram < 1 in the magnetosheath. For high-speed-stream-\ndriven storms, only 0.17% of the time is bram < 1, whereas for\nCME-driven storms 8.14% of the time bram < 1 and for cloud-\ndriven storms 24.1% of the time bram < 1.\n2.8. Plasma Sheet Density\n[15] The density of the Earth\u2019s plasma sheet is gov-\nerned by the solar wind density with a few hour time lag\n[Borovsky et al., 1998a]. In a superposed epoch study,\nDenton et al. [2006] compared the Earth\u2019s plasma sheet\ndensity for CME-driven storms with its density for CIR-\ndriven storms as functions of time during the storm and\nlocal time around geosynchronous orbit. Typical nonstorm\nnightside densities are \u00010.7 cm\b3. For both CME-driven\nand CIR-driven storms, Denton et al. found that super-\ndense plasma sheets [cf. Borovsky et al., 1997] occur,\nwith the density being twice or more the typical value. In\ncomparing the two drivers, CMEs drive a plasma sheet\nthat is more dense and the high-density values persist\nlonger. The relatively brief superdense intervals in CIR-\ndriven storms appear to coincide with the CIR, which has\na high solar wind density; this is in contrast to the\nenhanced geomagnetic activity, which persists long into\nthe high-speed stream that follows the CIR. This is\nbecause high-speed streams have only modest densities\nalthough they have strong vBz. In a similar fashion, the\nsuperdense intervals of CME-driven storms probably\ncoincide with the passing of the higher-density CME\nsheath. Note that CME-driven storms without a super-\ndense plasma sheet can occur [e.g., Thomsen et al.,\n1998a; Seki et al., 2005].\n2.9. Plasma Sheet Temperature\n[16] In a superposed epoch study, Denton et al. [2006]\ncompared the Earth\u2019s plasma sheet ion and electron\ntemperatures for CME-driven storms with CIR-driven\nstorms, making the examination as functions of time\nduring the storm and local time of the spacecraft mea-\nsurement. For both types of storms the ion and electron\ntemperatures are substantially elevated over typical val-\nues, probably because the solar wind speed is high and\nthe plasma sheet temperature is related to the solar wind\nvelocity [Borovsky et al., 1998a]. Comparing the plasma\nsheet temperature for the two types of storms (Figure 4 of\nDenton et al.), the plasma sheet is hotter for the CIR-\ndriven storms than it is for the CME-driven storms and\nthe elevated temperatures persist longer (days) for CIR-\ndriven storms. This is particularly evident when the\nelectron temperatures are examined.\n2.10. Plasma Sheet Composition\n[17] In the superposed epoch study, Denton et al. [2006]\ncompared the estimated O+\/H+ ratio in the Earth\u2019s plasma\nsheet for CME-driven storms with CIR-driven storms as\nfunctions of time during the storm and local time around\ngeosynchronous orbit. Both types of storms produced\nelevated ratios, but CMEs that drive large Dst storms\nproducing very elevated O+\/H+ ratios (exceeding unity).\nHence CME-driven storms can have very strong iono-\nspheric outflows of O+ and CME-driven storms can produce\nplasma sheets that are predominantly O+ by number density.\n2.11. Spacecraft Surface Charging\n[18] In the superposed epoch study, Denton et al. [2006]\ncompared the measured voltages of geosynchronous-orbit\nspacecraft with respect to the ambient plasma for CME-\ndriven storms with CIR-driven storms. The comparison is\nmade as functions of time during the storm and local time of\nthe spacecraft. For both types of storms the hot plasmas of\nthe magnetosphere drive substantial spacecraft charging,\neven outside of the Earth\u2019s shadow. The spacecraft charging\nthat occurs during CIR-driven storms is more severe than it\nis for CME-driven storms: the voltages attained are higher\n(greater than \b1000 volts), the region of local time over\nwhich the severe charging occurs is wider across the\nnightside of the magnetosphere, and the high voltages\npersist longer (days). This result is consistent with the\nwell-known fact that spacecraft charging is driven by hot\nelectrons [Whipple, 1981; Mullen et al., 1986], and, as\ndiscussed in section 2.5 above, the electron temperatures\nof the magnetosphere are hotter and more persistent for\nCIR-driven storms than they are for CME-driven storms.\nNote that voltages of differential surface charging of space-\ncraft are proportional to the voltages of surface charging [cf.\nBorovsky et al., 1998b, Figure 10], so differential surface\ncharging is anticipated to be more severe during CIR-driven\nstorms than it is during CME-driven storms.\n2.12. Ring Current and Dst\n[19] In a survey of Dst perturbations, Yermolaev and\nYermolaev [2002] found that CMEs are more effective at\nproducing strong Dst values than are CIRs and high-speed\nstreams. This conclusion is borne out by the Denton et al.\n[2006] survey that looked at the Earth\u2019s reaction to CMEs\nand CIRs in the solar wind, which also found that CMEs\nproduced larger Dst perturbations. This conclusion is also\nborne out by Figure 6, where storms and Dst perturbations\nare displayed on a solar rotation versus time plot. Times\nwhen storms are ongoing are indicated by black boxes and\ntimes when Dst < \b100 are indicated by white circles. As\ncan be seen, most of the strong Dst perturbations are\nassociated with randomly occurring storms at solar maxi-\nmum (CME-driven storms). Strong Dst perturbations are\nrare in the 27-day-recurring storms groups (high-speed-\nstream-driven storms). Dst is a measure of the strength of\nthe ring current and partial ring current in the magneto-\nsphere [Liemohn et al., 2001; Jordanova et al., 2003]. Since\na stronger ring current is produced by a plasma sheet that is\ndenser and cooler and magnetospheric convection that is\nstronger [Thomsen et al., 1998b; Kozyra and Liemohn,\n2003], all of which are more true for CMEs than CIRs, it\nA07S08 BOROVSKY AND DENTON: CME STORMS AND CIR STORMS\n7 of 17\nA07S08\nmakes sense that Dst is stronger for CME-driven storms\nthan it is for CIR-driven storms.\n2.13. Global Sawtooth Oscillations\n[20] Global sawtooth oscillations are periodic (3\u20134 hours)\noscillations of the magnetosphere that are characterized by a\nslow global distortion of the magnetosphere followed by a\nrapid crash back to a less-distorted morphology [Borovsky et\nal., 2001]. They are observed to be driven bymagnetic clouds\nin CMEs that have southward magnetic field in the range of\n\b5 to \b15 nT and that tend to have parameters that lead to\npolar cap saturation (Borovsky et al., submitted manuscript,\n2006). This is low Mach number solar wind and for these\nparameters the Earth\u2019s magnetosheath is a b < 1 plasma,\nwhich has very unusual flowproperties (see section 2.7).Why\nthese solar wind conditions lead to sawtooth oscillations of\nthemagnetosphere during storms is presently an area of active\nresearch. Global sawtooth oscillations are not seen during\nCIR-driven storms (Borovsky et al., submitted manuscript,\n2006).\n2.14. ULF Pulsations\n[21] ULF oscillations in the magnetosphere have been\nreported for CME-driven storms [Baker et al., 1998] and\nhigh-speed-stream-driven storms [Kessel et al., 2004], with\npulsation activity peaking in the declining phase of the solar\ncycle [Zieger, 1991]. In Figure 7 the power of ULF\npulsations PULF in the dawnside magnetosphere is binned\nfor various conditions. The data set used is the 1987\u20132000\ndaily average of the dawnside power obtained from the\nIMAGE and SAMNET ground-based magnetometer net-\nworks, courtesy of P. O\u2019Brien (private communication,\n2005); a description of the data set is found in the work\nof O\u2019Brien et al. [2003]. The dashed curve is the occurrence\ndistribution of Log10(PULF) for the entire 1987\u20132000 PULF\ndata set. The thick gray curve is the occurrence distribution\nof Log10(PULF) during high-speed-stream-driven storms, the\nthick black curve is the occurrence distribution of Log10\n(PULF) during CME-driven storms, and the thin black curve\nis the occurrence distribution of Log10(PULF) during the\nmagnetic cloud portions of CME-driven storms. As can be\nseen in Figure 7, PULF is elevated above normal for all\ntypes of storms. The amplitude of Pc5 oscillations in the\nmagnetosphere is proportional to the solar wind velocity\n[Engebretson et al., 1998; Mathie and Mann, 2001]. Elec-\ntron acceleration by Pc5 oscillations are believed to be\nresponsible for the production of high fluxes of relativistic\nelectrons in the outer radiation belts [Rostoker et al., 1998],\nparticularly during long intervals of active ULF pulsations\n[Mathie and Mann, 2000; O\u2019Brien et al., 2001], which\nFigure 6. Times of high geomagnetic activity (Kp \u0002 4+)\nare plotted as the black boxes on a solar rotation versus year\nplot. Times when Dst < \b100 are plotted as white points.\nFigure 7. For various data sets (as labeled) the logarithm\nof the dawnside ULF power Log10(PULF), where PULF is in\nunits of nT2\/Hz, is binned. The median values of\nLog10(PULF) for the various distributions are 5.09 for the\n1963\u20132004 OMNI2 data set, 6.57 for high-speed-stream-\ndriven storms, 6.10 for storms driven by CMEs, and 6.56\nfor the magnetic cloud portions of CME-driven storms.\nA07S08 BOROVSKY AND DENTON: CME STORMS AND CIR STORMS\n8 of 17\nA07S08\noccur during longer intervals of high-velocity solar wind\nassociated with recurrent high-speed streams. This is shown\nin Figure 8, where storms and intervals of high ULF power\nare shown on a solar rotation versus time plot for the years\n1987\u20132000. The storms are indicated as black boxes and\nintervals when PULF > 1 \u0005 107 nT2\/Hz are indicated as\nwhite circles. As can be seen, the longest (multiday) inter-\nvals of elevated ULF power are found with the 27-day\nrecurring storm groups, particularly in the year 1994.\nThe intervals of active ULF pulsations are longer for CIR-\ndriven storms than they are for CME-driven storms because\nthe intervals of elevated solar wind velocity are longer.\nEvidence for this can be found in Figure 9. For full years\nwhen there is thorough data coverage of the solar wind (the\nyears 1995\u2013present), a measure of the duration of high-\nspeed flows is plotted in Figure 9 as the green bars. This\nmeasure is made as follows. For each year of data, the\ndurations of all flows wherein the solar wind velocity is\nsustained at 550 km\/s or higher are calculated. Then, for\neach year, the 12 longest-duration fast flows are taken. The\nheight of the green bar in Figure 9 is the mean duration\nfor those 12 longest flows that year. The sunspot number is\nalso plotted as the black bars in Figure 9, and intervals\nwhen 27-day recurring storms (which are high-speed-stream\ndriven) were ongoing are marked with the horizontal blue\nbands (see section 2.2 for the methodology of finding the\nrecurring storm groups). As can be seen, when recurring\nCIR-driven storms were ongoing (which tends to be in the\ndeclining phase of the solar cycle), the fast flow durations\nwere longer. Since the power in ULF pulsations is propor-\ntional to the solar wind speed, it follows that the duration of\nintervals of enhanced ULF activity are longer in years when\nCIR-driven storms are present than for the rest of the solar\ncycle. This is also shown in Figure 9, where a 0.5-year\nrunning average of the measured flux of 1.1\u20131.5 MeV\nelectrons at geosynchronous orbit is plotted as the red curve.\n(See section 2.17 for a description of this measurement.)\nThis flux is elevated in the years when the durations of the\nhigh-speed flows were long (green bars).\n2.15. Distortion of the Dipole\n[22] CIR-driven storms produce modest stretching of the\ndipole magnetic field toward a tail-like geometry (with the\nnear-equatorial field at geosynchronous orbit rotated \u000130\u0003\nFigure 8. Times of high geomagnetic activity (Kp \u0002 4+)\nare plotted as the black boxes on a solar rotation versus year\nplot. Times when the dawnside ULF power PULF exceeds\n1 \u0005 107 nT2\/Hz are plotted as white circles. The ULF power\nwas provided by Paul O\u2019Brien [O\u2019Brien et al., 2003].\nFigure 9. As functions of time, the sunspot number (black\nbars, left axis), duration of high-speed flows of each year\n(green bars, left axis), and a 0.5-year running average of the\nflux of 1.1\u20131.5 MeV electrons at geosynchronous orbit (red\ncurve, right axis) are plotted. The flow duration plotted is\nthe mean value of the 12 longest-duration fast flow that\nyear, where fast flows are v \u0002 550 km\/s, obtained with the\nOMNI2 data set [King and Papitashvili, 2005]. The\nenergetic electron fluxes are multispacecraft averages\nobtained from the SOPA instruments [Reeves et al.,\n1997]. Time intervals when 27-day recurring storms were\nongoing are marked with the blue horizontal bands.\nA07S08 BOROVSKY AND DENTON: CME STORMS AND CIR STORMS\n9 of 17\nA07S08\nfrom dipolar) with the stretching angle proportional to the\nlocal pressure of the ion plasma sheet [see Borovsky et al.,\n1998b, Figure 18]. During times when global sawtooth\noscillations occur, which are driven by CMEs, the dipole\nmagnetic field can show fully tail-like stretching at geosyn-\nchronous orbit (with the near-equatorial field rotated \u000170\u0003\nfrom dipolar) (Borovsky et al., submitted manuscript,\n2006). Two further studies indicate that large distortions\nof the dipole magnetic field are associated with CME-driven\nstorms. First, the Tsyganenko et al. [2003] catalog of big\ndistortion events for the inner magnetosphere all were large\nDst events that occurred at solar maximum, which is\nindicative of driving by CMEs. Second, the flankside lobe\nencounters by geosynchronous spacecraft at the equator that\nwere tabulated during an interval of solar maximum found\nthat most lobe encounters were associated with large-Dst\nstorms [Moldwin et al., 1995], which is also consistent with\ndriving by CMEs.\n2.16. Saturation of Polar Cap Potential\n[23] Typically, under vBs driving by the solar wind, the\ncross-polar-cap potential j is linearly proportional to vBs\n[Reiff and Luhmann, 1986], where v is the solar wind\nvelocity and Bs is the southward (GSM) component of the\nIMF, but under rare circumstances when the solar wind\nconditions are favorable, the cross-polar-cap potential j will\nreach a saturation value and will no longer be proportional\nto vBs. During several CME-driven storms this saturation\nhas been analyzed [Ober et al., 2003; Boudouridis et al.,\n2004; Hairston et al., 2005]. Equation (1) of Siscoe et al.\n[2004] describes this saturation: saturation occurs when the\nsecond term in the denominator of that equation exceeds\napproximately 2, which occurs when\nvA SP=806 > 2; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere vA is the Alfven velocity in the unshocked solar wind\n(in units of km\/s) and SP is the height-integrated Pederson\nconductivity of the dayside ionosphere (in units of mho).\nTaking SP = 0.77 F10.7\n1\/2 (from equation (4) of Ober et al.\n[2003]), where F10.7 is the radio emission of the Sun at\n10.7 cm which is a proxy for solar EUV emission which\nproduces ionospheric ionization [cf. Balan et al., 1993], and\nF10.7 \u0006 SN (from Figure 1 and Table 2 of Floyd et al.\n[2005]), where SN is the international sunspot number,\nexpression (1) is rewritten as\nQ \u000b vAS1=2N =1050 > 2; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere Q is a saturation parameter. The OMNI2 data set is\nused to find times when expression (2) is satisfied: the\nresults are displayed in Figures 10 and 11. In Figure 10 the\ntemperature-speed plot of the solar wind using the OMNI2\ndata set [King and Papitashvili, 2005] is shown (black\npoints) and the data points wherein expression (2) is\nsatisfied are plotted in red. Expression (2) is satisfied 0.96%\nof the time in the 1963\u20132004 OMNI2 data set. These red\npoints where the solar wind will drive the polar cap voltage\ninto saturation are outliers to the normal solar wind\npopulation; this is consistent with the red points being\nCMEs [see, e.g., Elliott et al., 2005, Figure 1a]. In Figure 11\nthe sunspot number SN is plotted as a function of time as the\nblack points, with the values at times when expression (2) is\nsatisfied plotted in red. As can be seen, the time intervals\nwhen expression (2) is satisfied occur during solar maxima;\nthis is again consistent with those times being CMEs. A\ndetailed examination of ACE solar-wind data for time\nintervals when expression (2) is satisfied (J. Steinberg,\nprivate communication, 2005) finds that most of those\nintervals are in CMEs, typically CMEs with low number\ndensity. A minor fraction of the points in the OMNI2 data\nset satisfying expression (2) are low-density pressure\nbalance structures embedded in the solar wind. Polar cap\nFigure 10. Using the hourly averaged solar wind values in\nthe 1963\u20132004 OMNI2 data set, the ion temperature of the\nsolar wind is plotted as a function of the velocity of the solar\nwind (black points). During time intervals when the\nconditions of the solar wind should result in a saturation\nof the Earth\u2019s cross-polar-cap potential (expression (2)), the\npoints are replotted in red. As can be seen, the red points\nform a population of outliers around the main solar wind\npopulation.\nFigure 11. The sunspot number SN is plotted as a function\nof time for 1963\u20132004 (black points). Using the OMNI2\ndata set, time intervals in which the Earth\u2019s polar-cap\nvoltage should saturate are calculated (expression (2)) and\nthe sunspot number for those time intervals are replotted in\nred. As can be seen, those times occur mainly during solar\nmaximum.\nA07S08 BOROVSKY AND DENTON: CME STORMS AND CIR STORMS\n10 of 17\nA07S08\nsaturation is usually thought of as a phenomenon associated\nwith strong storms, but note that according to expression (2)\nand Figure 10 the polar cap potential will saturate for\ndrivers that are not extremely strong (i.e., it will saturate for\nslow CMEs also). To further explore the polar cap saturation\nfor CME- and CIR-driven storms, the value of Q is binned\nunder various circumstances in the top panel of Figure 12.\nThe dashed curve is the occurrence distribution of Q for the\nentire 1963\u20132004 OMNI2 data set, the thick gray curve is\nthe occurrence distribution of Q for high-speed-stream-\ndriven storms, the thick black curve is the occurrence\ndistribution of Q for CME-driven storms, and the thin black\ncurve is the occurrence distribution of Q for the magnetic\ncloud portions of CME-driven storms. As can be seen,\nsaturation of the polar cap (Q > 2) occurs rarely for high-\nspeed-stream-driven storms but commonly for CME-driven\nstorms. Even considering partial saturation, for high-speed-\nstream-driven storms only 4.4% of the time is Q > 1,\nwhereas for CME-driven storms 39.3% of the time Q > 1\nand for cloud-driven storms 54.2% of the time Q > 1. To\nexplore whether the polar cap saturation is simply owed to\nthe high values of SP during solar maximum when CMEs\ntend to occur, the Alfven velocity vA in the solar wind and\nthe square root of the sunspot number SN\n1\/2 are binned in the\nmiddle and bottom panels of Figure 12. Examining the\nvarious curves in the middle and bottom panels it can be\nconcluded that the higher values of Q = vA SP\/806 = vASN\n1\/2\/\n1050 for CME-driven storms are owed both to higher values\nof vA in the solar wind and to higher values of SN\n1\/2.\n2.17. Fluxes of Relativistic Electrons\n[24] The Earth\u2019s outer electron radiation belt is very\ndynamic. It is well known that the fluxes of relativistic\nelectrons in the outer radiation belt are maximized by\nrecurring high-speed-stream-driven storms during the de-\nclining phase of the solar cycle [Paulikas and Blake, 1976;\nLove et al., 2000; Lam, 2004]. Sufficiently high fluxes of\nelectrons in this belt lead to internal charging in spacecraft,\nwhich leads to operational problems for spacecraft in\ngeosynchronous orbit [Romanova et al., 2005]. The fre-\nquency of these problems peaks during the declining phase\nof the solar cycle where CIR-driven storms peak [Wrenn et\nal., 2002]. In Figure 13 the production of intense fluxes of\nrelativistic electrons in the outer radiation belts by the two\ntypes of storms in explored. For the years 1993\u20132001\ngeomagnetic storms are indicated (black boxes) on a solar\nrotation versus time plot. The 27-day-recurring storm\ngroups (CIR-driven storms) are clearly seen in 1994 and\n1995 and in late 1999\/early 2000. The McPherron catalog\nof CIR stream interfaces for the years 1994\u20131996 is plotted\nin yellow. In Figure 13, times when the multispacecraft\ndaily average of 1.1\u20131.5 MeV electrons at geosynchronous\norbit as measured by the SOPA energetic particle instru-\nments [Belian et al., 1992] exceeds 30 electrons\/cm2\/s\/ster\/\nkeV are indicated in red. The relativistic-electron fluxes\nFigure 12. In the top panel the polar-cap-saturation factor\nQ = vASN\n1\/2\/1050 is binned or various data sets (as labeled).\nSaturation of the polar cap occurs for Q > 2. The median\nvalues of Q for the various distributions are 0.45 for the\n1963\u20132004 OMNI2 data set, 0.36 for high-speed-stream-\ndriven storms, 0.87 for CME-driven storms, and 1.06 for\ncloud-driven storms.

In the bottom panel the\nsquare root of the sunspot number SN\n1\/2 is plotted. The\nmedian values of SN\n1\/2 for the various distributions are 8.0\nfor the 1963\u20132004 OMNI2 data set, 4.8 for high-speed-\nstream-driven storms, 9.9 for CME-driven storms, and 8.7\nfor cloud-driven storms.\nA07S08 BOROVSKY AND DENTON: CME STORMS AND CIR STORMS\n11 of 17\nA07S08\nwere provided by R. Friedel (private communication, 2005).\nAs can be seen in the figure, the high fluxes of relativistic\nelectrons are predominantly associated with CIR-driven\nstorms. There are some relativistic electron events that are\nassociated with randomly occurring storms, e.g., in the\nyears 1996\u20132002, but a comparison of these events with\nthe Cane and Richardson CME catalog and the Lepping\nmagnetic cloud catalog finds that only one event is clearly\nCME related. It may be that the nonrecurrent relativistic\nelectron flux events are associated with IRs (i.e., nonrecur-\nrent high-speed-stream-driven storms). In Figure 13, note\nthe well-known delay in the appearance of intense relativ-\nistic electron fluxes from the onsets of the storms [cf.\nFriedel et al., 2002].\n2.18. Formation of New Ion and Electron Radiation\nBelts\n[25] The production of a new ion radiation belt is known\nto be caused by the capture of SEP ions during a strong\nshock compression of the magnetosphere [Lorentzen et al.,\n2002; Hudson et al., 2004]. SEPs and strong shocks are\nboth CME-driven phenomena, and the formation of a new\nion radiation belt is therefore a manifestation of CME-\ndriven storms. The formation of a new inner electron\nradiation belt has been observed coincident with the com-\npression of the magnetosphere by SSCs [Blake et al., 1992;\nTverskaya et al., 2003; Obara and Li, 2003; Looper et al.,\n2005]. The mechanism is believed to be a displacement of\ntrapped electrons during a rapid compression and relaxation\nof the magnetosphere caused by a CME-driven interplane-\ntary shock [Li et al., 1993]. No formation of a new radiation\nbelt has been observed in association with a CIR.\n2.19. Magnetospheric Convection Interval\n[26] In the superposed-epoch study of the reaction of the\nmagnetosphere to CMEs and CIRs, Denton et al. [2006]\nexamined the temporal profile of the Kp index. Kp is a\nmeasure of the strength of convection in the magnetosphere\n[Thomsen, 2004]. Denton et al. found that CMEs produce a\nKp temporal profile that is peaked near the time of Dst\nmaximum and that falls quickly (in a fraction of a day) back\nto prestorm levels, whereas CIRs produce a Kp temporal\nprofile that peaks near the time of Dst maximum but falls\nslowly (over a few days) back to prestorm levels. Hence the\ninterval of enhanced convection is longer for CIR-driven\nstorms than it is for CME-driven storms. This can also be\nseen in both panels of Figure 1, where the durations of the\nstorms in the 27-day recurring groups (high-speed-stream-\ndriven storms) is notably longer than the durations of the\nrandomly occurring storms (CME-driven storms). Note that\nthe maximum values of Kp, i.e., the strongest peak convec-\ntion, can be higher for CME-driven storms [e.g., Richardson\net al., 2001, Figure 1].\n2.20. Great Aurora\n[27] Great auroras have \u2018\u2018high visual brightness with a\nprogression to exceptionally low latitudes\u2019\u2019 [Jones, 1992].\nAn examination of the catalog of great aurora events\nof Jones [1992], supplemented by Yevlashin [2000],\nPallamraju and Chakrabarti [2005], and Mikhalev et al.\n[2004], finds that the great aurora chiefly occur during solar\nmaximum. A display of the solar cycle dependence of great\naurora is shown in Figure 14, where the sunspot number is\nplotted as a function of time and the reported occurrences of\ngreat aurora are indicated by the circles. As can be seen,\nthere is a concentration of great auroras at the solar maxima,\nbut they occur in other phases in the solar cycle, too. In\nFigure 15 intervals of Kp \u0002 4+ (black points) and incidents\nof great auroras (tan points) are displayed on a 27.27-day\nsolar-rotation versus year plot. Here, data for the 55 years\n1950\u20132005 are shown. Recurrent storm activity (high-\nspeed-stream-driven storms) is seen as a black patch. As\nFigure 13. Times of high geomagnetic activity (Kp \u0002 4+)\nare plotted as the black points on a solar-rotation versus year\nplot. Times when the daily flux of 1.1\u20131.5 MeVelectrons at\ngeosynchronous orbit exceeds 30 counts\/cm2\/s\/ster\/keV are\nindicated in red and the McPherron catalog of CIR stream\ninterfaces for the years 1994\u20131996 is plotted in yellow. The\nrelativistic electron flux was provided by Reiner Friedel.\nA07S08 BOROVSKY AND DENTON: CME STORMS AND CIR STORMS\n12 of 17\nA07S08\ncan be seen, the great aurora generally are not associated\nwith the recurrent activity, rather they are associated with\nisolated storms. Perusing through Figure 15 at high reso-\nlutions, two exceptions are found: 13\u201314 July 1982, where\na great aurora incident occurred during a recurrent storm,\nand 13 September 1993, where a great aurora incident\noccurred during a recurrent high-speed stream. The July\n1982 incident was flare-associated, so this major storm was\nlikely CME associated. The September 1993 incident was\nnot flare-associated and no solar wind data is available to\ndiscern whether or not a magnetic cloud was embedded in\nthe high-speed wind; no SSC occurred, so if a cloud was\npresent, it was not extraordinarily fast. From Figure 15 and\nthe subsequent analysis it is concluded that 1 out of 44\nincidents of great aurora (\u00012%) are caused by CIR-driven\nstorms. Of the four incidents of great aurora that occurred\nduring the years of the McPherron CIR catalog (the\nyears 1994\u20131996 and 2002\u20132003), none was temporally\nassociated with CIRs. Of the 11 incidents of great aurora\nthat occurred during the years when both the Cane and\nRichardson CME catalog and the Lepping magnetic cloud\ncatalog were available (the years 1998\u20132002), 10 were\ntemporally associated with CMEs (\u000191%). Hence from\nall of this evidence it is concluded that great aurora are\nassociated chiefly with CME-driven storms and rarely with\nCIR-driven storms. Supporting this notion, Jones [1974]\npoints out a study finding that low-latitude aurora \u2018\u2018can\nusually be associated with solar flares occurring 1 to 4 days\nearlier.\u2019\u2019 Also, Legrand and Simon [1988] examined the\nlatitudes of CME-associated and CIR-associated (\u2018\u2018shock\u2019\u2019\nand \u2018\u2018stream\u2019\u2019) aurora and found that the stream-associated\naurora did not progress equatorward beyond 56\u0003, whereas\nthe CME-associated aurora did. Consistent with this, of the\n26 low-latitude auroral events measured by STELAB in\n1989\u20132004 [Shiokawa et al., 2005], only one event oc-\ncurred during the 1993\u20131995 era of recurring high-speed\nstreams. Since the aurora do not progress as far equatorward\nfor CIR-driven storms, it may also follow that the polar-cap\narea does not get as large for CIR-driven storms as it can\nduring CME-driven storms.\n2.21. Geomagnetically Induced Currents (GIC)\n[28] Geomagnetically induced currents that are hazardous\nto Earth-based electrical power systems are believed to be\ncaused by rapid intensification of ionospheric currents that\nFigure 14. The sunspot number is plotted as a function of\ntime. Occurrences of great aurora [from Jones, 1992;\nYevlashin, 2000; Pallamraju and Chakrabarti, 2005;\nMikhalev et al., 2004] are plotted as the circles with\ndiamond centers.\nFigure 15. Times of high geomagnetic activity (Kp \u0002 4+)\nare plotted as the black boxes on a solar rotation versus year\nplot. Historical occurrences of great aurora are plotted as the\nred circles and historical occurrences of damaging geomag-\nnetically induced currents (GIC) are plotted as the yellow\ncircles.\nA07S08 BOROVSKY AND DENTON: CME STORMS AND CIR STORMS\n13 of 17\nA07S08\ncan be driven by shock compression of the magnetosphere\nor by a substorm [Pulkkinen et al., 2005]. Of the four events\nin the catalog of Boteler [2001], plus the March 1991 event\n[Bolduc, 2002], the April 2000 event [Pulkkinen et al.,\n2003], and the October 2003 event [Kappenman, 2005], all\nhave occurred at solar maximum or in the early declining\nphase. This is demonstrated in Figure 16 where the sunspot\nnumber is plotted versus time with the seven GIC events\nindicated as the circles with diamonds. From direct solar\nwind measurements or from their temporal association with\nlarge solar flares, all seven of these GIC events are associ-\nated with CME-driven storms. Examining their locations\nrelative to storms on solar rotation versus time plots (see\nFigure 15), none of the GIC events are associated with\n27-day recurring geomagnetic activity. Hence it is concluded\nthat hazardous GIC are predominantly associated with\nCME-driven storms rather than CIR-driven storms.\n3. Other Stormtime Differences\n[29] Several stormtime phenomena have not been or\ncould not be analyzed for inclusion in Table 1. Some of\nthese pertain to observations of the ionosphere. It is hoped\nthat the discussion of this section will motivate future\nresearch to clarify how these phenomena fit into CME-\ndriven and CIR-driven geomagnetic storms.\n[30] Large equatorial bubbles, which appear in the topside\nionosphere when Dst is increasing in magnitude [Huang et\nal., 2002; Basu et al., 2005], have been reported for many\nCME-driven magnetic storms [e.g., Huang et al., 2001;\nAbdu et al., 2003; Basu et al., 2005]. Large equatorial\nbubbles do occur for Dst perturbations at solar minimum but\nat a much lesser rate than they do at solar maximum [Huang\net al., 2002]. The bubbles are attributed to penetration\nelectric fields associated with build up of the ring current:\nsince ring current buildup is greater for CME-driven storms,\none would expect the bubbles to be primarily a CME-driven\nstorm phenomenon.\n[31] SAPS (subauroral polarization stream) and SAID\n(subauroral ion drift) ionospheric flow streams are associ-\nated with a deep penetration of the ion plasma sheet into the\ndipolar magnetosphere [Anderson et al., 1993; Garner et\nal., 2004]. SAPS and SAID events have been observed and\nanalyzed for several CME-driven storms [e.g., Foster et al.,\n1994; Garner et al., 2004; Foster and Vo, 2002], but no\ncomparisons have been made for their occurrence probabil-\nities and properties for CIR versus CME-driven storms.\n[32] A recently discovered phenomenon is the disappear-\nance of AKR (auroral kilometric radiation) during\nCME-driven storms coincident with the appearance of a\nsuperdense plasma sheet [Seki et al., 2005; Morioka et al.,\n2003]. The AKR-disappearance events in the literature are\nall associated with CME-driven storms, except the 11\nJanuary 1994 event, which corresponds to a superdense\nplasma sheet in a recurring CIR-driven storm. A comparison\nof the nature of the AKR disappearance for the hotter\nsuperdense plasma sheets of CIR-driven storms and the\ncooler superdense plasma sheets of CME-driven storms has\nnot been made.\n[33] The injection of cool dense plasma sheet (CDPS)\nmaterial (which is probably low-latitude boundary layer\n(LLBL) plasma) into the nightside of the dipolar magneto-\nsphere has been documented to occur for both types of storms.\nThe collection of all knownnightside dense-plasma injections\nfind that they are statistically found at times of elevated Kp\n(3.1 \u00b1 1.2) and mildly elevated values of Dst (\b21 \u00b1 21 nT)\n[cf. Lavraud et al., 2005]. This injection has been seen for\nCME-driven storms (15 of the 30 events in Table 1 of\nThomsen et al. [2003] are in the Cane and Richardson\n[2003] catalog of shock-sheath-CME events) and this injec-\ntion has been estimated to occur for \u000150% of high-speed-\nstream-driven storms [Borovsky and Steinberg, 2006].\n[34] One phenomenon that is similar for both types of\nstorms is the appearance of a plasmaspheric drainage plume\nin the dayside magnetosphere in the early phases of a storm.\nAs magnetospheric convection increases, the outer portions\nof the plasmasphere are transferred from closed cold plasma\ndrift trajectories to open trajectories, and the material of the\nouter plasmasphere convects from the middle magneto-\nsphere to the dayside neutral line. Plasmaspheric drainage\nplumes have been studied for CIR-driven storms [Borovsky\net al., 1998b] and for CME-driven storms [Thomsen et al.,\n1998a]. A comparison of the details of drainage plume\nphenomenon for the two types of storms has not been made.\n[35] The tongue of ionization and polar cap patches are\nhigher-density ionospheric plasma convecting into and\nacross the polar cap from the dayside. They are related to\nthe plasmaspheric drainage plume seen in the magneto-\nsphere when geomagnetic activity increases [Su et al.,\n2001]. High-density polar cap events have been investigated\nfor several CME-driven storms [e.g., Sojka et al., 1992;\nCrowley et al., 2000; Foster et al., 2005], but a comparison\nof their occurrence rate and properties between CME-driven\nstorms and CIR-driven storms has not been performed.\n[36] In this report, no attempt has been made to sort out\nthe occurrences and intensities of various plasma waves in\nFigure 16. The sunspot number is plotted as a function of\ntime. Occurrences of hazardous GIC (geomagnetically\ninduced current) [from Boteler, 2001; Bolduc, 2002;\nPulkkinen et al., 2003; Kappenman, 2005] are plotted as\nthe circles with diamond centers.\nA07S08 BOROVSKY AND DENTON: CME STORMS AND CIR STORMS\n14 of 17\nA07S08\nthe magnetosphere that are thought to be important for the\nphysics of storms, such as whistler-mode chorus [Villalon\nand Burke, 1995; Smith et al., 2004], electromagnetic ion\ncyclotron waves [Jordanova et al., 1998; Summers and\nThorne, 2003], and plasmaspheric hiss [Horne et al., 2003].\n[37] Finally, the authors have made no attempt here to\ncompare the morphology and phenomenology of the aurora\nduring CME-driven storms and CIR-driven storms.\n4. Summary\n[38] The differences between CME-driven storms and\nCIR-driven storms were explored and the findings were\ncollected into Table 1. In section 2 the 21 phenomena listed\nin Table 1 were discussed, item by item.\n[39] In a nutshell, CME-driven storms are brief, have\ndenser plasma sheets, have stronger ring currents and Dst\nperturbation, have solar energetic particle events, and they\ncan produce new radiation belts, great auroras, and danger-\nous geomagnetically induced currents. CIR-driven storms\nare of longer duration, have hotter plasma sheets and hence\nstronger spacecraft charging, and produce higher fluxes of\nrelativistic electrons. The magnetosphere is more likely to\nbe preconditioned by a geomagnetically calm interval prior\nto a CIR-driven storm than it is prior to a CME-driven\nstorm. CME-driven storms are more hazardous to Earth-\nbased systems and CIR-driven storms are more hazardous to\nspace-based assets, particularly at geosynchronous orbit.\nCME-driven storms occur randomly in time with an occur-\nrence frequency that is highest during solar maximum\nwhereas CIR-driven storms recur with a 27-day period\nprimarily in the declining phase of the solar cycle.\n[40] Analogous to geomagnetic storms, terrestrial thun-\nderstorms also vary, with differing outputs of rain, wind,\nhail, lightning, and tornadoes. Also, thunderstorms have\ndifferent types of drivers: radiation-driven convection (the\nisland effect) or air-mass interaction (frontal uplift). Histor-\nically, and still typically, geomagnetic storms are gauged\nonly by the size of their Dst signature [e.g., Gonzalez et al.,\n1994; Loewe and Prolss, 1997]: this is akin to gauging the\nseverity of thunderstorms only by their output of hail.\n[41] One lesson that can be taken from this study is\nthat when geomagnetic storms are studied, CME-driven\nstorms and CIR-driven storms should be studied sepa-\nrately. A second lesson that can be taken from this study\nis that Dst alone is a poor indicator of the properties of\nstorms.\n[42] Acknowledgments.
