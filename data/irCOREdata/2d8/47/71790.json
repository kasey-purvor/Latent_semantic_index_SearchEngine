Our argument,  exemplified through  detailed \nmapping of the changing geographies of headhunting firms between 1992 and 2005,  \ndemonstrates the need for complex and blurred typologies of internationalization and \nsimilarly complex internationalization theory.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3 \n1. Introduction \nUnderstanding the internationalization of producer services continues to attract \nconsiderable attention in academic and policy circles (e.g. Bryson et. al., 2004; Roberts, \n1988; UNCTAD, 2004). However, despite this, the theoretical framework used to \nexplore the internationalization process has changed little in recent times beyond \nDunning and Norman\u2019s (1983; 1987) initial work. Meanwhile, elsewhere the analyses \nof globalization have become increasingly intricate (e.g. Amin, 2002; Dicken et al, \n2001; Yeung, 2005).  In this paper, we argue that it is, therefore, necessary to revisit \ninternationalization theory relating to producer service firms and provide refinements \nthat reflect the ever growing and maturing body of knowledge that can be used to \nconceptualise globalization. In particular,  we draw on recent insights into the \ncontemporary role of intermediaries (Peck and Theodore, 2001; Peck et al, 2005) and \n\u2018soft capitalisms\u2019 in the global economy (Thrift, 1997) as well as understandings of the \nvarious forms of \u2018spatial economy\u2019 that firms produce through internationalization \n(Yeung, 2005) and tie these to internationalization theory relating to producer service \nfirms. This allows us to develop a more wide-ranging and complex analysis of the \nrationale (the why?) behind internationalization whilst also showing that the strategies \nused by firms to internationalize (the how) must be understood within any framework \nused to theorise internationalization. \nThis is achieved through an original examination of the executive search \n(headhunting) industry in Europe. Whilst other sectors have been comprehensively \nexamined (e.g. Bagschi-Sen and Sen, 1997; Jones, 2005), there remains a troubling void \nin relation to the recent growth of labour-related producer services.  This has partially \nbeen resolved through an examination of temping agencies and their intermediary role \nbetween employers and workers in low-paid occupations (Ward, 2004; Peck and \nTheodore, 2001).  However, at the opposite end of the labour market, there remains an \n 4 \nabsence of scholarship where executive search plays a pivotal role in elite recruitment.  \nWith the exceptions of Boyle et. al. (1996) and Cuthbertson (1996), more than a decade \nhas  passed since academics have paid heed to the insights that this industry can provide \ninto understanding the complexities of the internationalization of producer services in \nthe world economy.  Moreover, this neglect of the global headhunting industry is \nparticularly significant because of its relationship to what Thrift (1997) terms the \n\u2018cultural circuit of capitalism\u2019.  For Thrift, this circuit involves the work of business \nschool MBA programmes, management consultancy and management gurus \npromulgating innovative business ideas and practices to better equip managers for the \ninevitable uncertainty inherent within the contemporary global economy. As this paper \ndemonstrates, the headhunting industry draws on and incorporates all three actors in a \nhybrid institutional form to construct the intermediary marketplace executive search \nfirms claim to serve. The internationalization of these firms is integral to their strategy \nto develop and exploit this marketplace and, therefore, must be understood through \ninternationalization theory sensitive to such contemporary processes. \nWe, develop  this argument by, initially, offering a brief geographical analysis of \nwhy and how the leading executive search firms have internationalised over the last two \ndecades.  Drawing on this we discuss the way international networks have been used to \npenetrate new marketplaces, reproduce demand for intermediary services and develop \ncomplex spatial economies (Yeung, 2005). This, we argue, suggests theorisations of the \ninternationalization of advanced producer services must be refined to understand the \nway future strategic activities are enabled by the opening of overseas offices in addition \nto the benefits gained in relation to serving existing markets and clients.  This \u2018future\u2019 \nrationale is related to the development of an intermediaries marketplace using, in part, \nthe strategies of \u2018soft capitalism\u2019.  \n 5 \nIn common with research into other producer services, a range of methodologies \nare necessary to overcome the access issues inherent in studying an industry as secretive \nas headhunting.  To this end, the research drawn on in this paper started by identifying \nthe leading 20 international headhunting firms by 2004 global revenue.  This data was \nobtained directly from the firms themselves, or through industry compendiums (see, for \nexample, Jenn 2005).  Using the same combination of sources, we then analysed office \nlocation change for the leading 15 international headhunting firms in more detail \nbetween 1987 and 2005 (the where of internationalization).  These quantitative \nmeasures are accompanied by a critical reading of the rhetoric of internationalization \nproduced by the firms themselves through media such as corporate websites, publicity \ndocuments and business magazines.  Whilst these sources usefully document the way \nfirms present their international corporate strategies, it is worth noting that this \ninformation is often as much about firm self-promotion as it is an accurate description \nof what the firm is actually doing.  As such, we triangulated this information with \nexternal reflection of firms practice through mainstream and specialist newspapers and \nmagazines.  Finally, the research presented below also implicitly draws on the authors\u2019 \nprevious primary research into the clients of global headhunting firms in the law, \nadvertising and finance sectors.   The rest of the paper develops our argument in six \nmain sections. In sections two and three, we very briefly revisit the theoretical writings \nthat discuss why producer service firms internationalize.  In sections four, five and six, \nwe then trace the temporal processes of growth (organic, M&A and alliances\/networks), \nthe organisational architecture of headhunting firms in internationalization (wholly \nowned, network and hybrid) and the geography of internationalization, respectively.  \nFinally, in sections seven and eight, we consider how our reading of the why, how and \nwhere of internationalization in global headhunting firms can shed new understandings \non the internationalization of producer services in a contemporary world economy.   \n 6 \n \n2. Theorizing internationalization in producer services  \nBeginning with the \u2018why internationalize?\u2019 question, geographers have previously \ndrawn on the seminal contribution of Dunning and Norman\u2019s (1983; 1987) \u2018eclectic\u2019 \nOwnership-Location-Internalisation (OLI) paradigm to understand the \ninternationalization of producer services (see Dicken, 2003).  This suggests that \nproducer service firms will internationalise if they have competitive advantages over \nhost firms with respect to OLI assets and competencies, as shown in table 1. Bryson et \nal (2004, 204) have developed this explanation in relation to producer services \nsuggesting that ownership advantage (what they call firm-specific advantage) is based \non the reputation of the firm and the knowledge of its labour force.  Location advantage \nis based on the importance of having knowledge of local market nuances and providing \nthe service to clients face-to-face in that location.  Internalisation advantages exist in the \nform of: the ability to exploit firm-specific knowledge without the risk of giving away \ncompetitive insights; the ability to use existing knowledge of a client\u2019s needs in the \nprovision of services; and also in the form of control over the quality of the service \nprovided.  If each of these advantages are best exploited by having overseas offices \n(rather than exporting or \u2018licensing\u2019 provision to an overseas firm) then an \ninternationalization strategy should be employed. \nIt must be noted, however, that the strategies and vectors of internationalization \n(the how) are more messy and complex than such an approach initially suggests.  For \nexample, in relation to law, Beaverstock et al (1999), Morgan and Quack (2005) and \nWarf (2001) have indicated that firms use combinations of: organic office openings; \nM&As; and alliance\/networks simultaneously in the internationalization process. Such \ndiverse internationalization strategies lead to different types of integration and spatial \neconomies, depending on the specific nature of the overseas market in question.  \n 7 \nFollowing Bartlett and Ghoshal (1998), these forms range from those effectively \ncreating stand-alone offices (multinational) to those allowing highly integrated \norganizations to emerge (transnational) (table 2).  In reality, however, these law firms \nreflect the complex type of \u2018differentiated network\u2019 Nohria and Ghoshal (1997) have \ndescribed. It is too simplistic to suggest a firm operates as only one of these forms. \nInstead, certain parts of the network exhibit transnational interconnectivity whilst other \nparts display multinational independence.   \nIt is, therefore, necessary to couple analysis of the rationale for \ninternationalization with the strategy (M&A, organic growth or alliance\/network) so as \nto consider the way internationalization practices might change over time and space as \njustification for opening overseas offices vary.  Moreover, it is also too simplistic to \nignore the multitude of ways firms can use internationalization to create new economic \nadvantages through the geographical organization of business activities. As recent work \nhas demonstrated (Dicken et al, 2001; Hess, 2004), firms become \u2018embedded\u2019 within \nand between economic spaces as a result of internationalization.  We  draw on this \nargument to suggest that internationalization theory relating to producer services must \nbe made more intricate so as to inter-link the \u2018how\u2019 and \u2018why\u2019 to understandings of the \nnew (proactive) benefits bought about by internationalization, not just those gained \nfrom reactive behaviours. The work of Yeung (2005) typifies previous attempts at such \na task.  He proposes a more nuanced analysis of the internationalization of firms in \norder to understand how the process leads to the creation of \u2018spatial economies\u2019.  He \ndefines this as the way firms \u201cexpand  \u2026 [their] \u2026 organizational space \nand\u2026economize on this spatial expansion\u201d (Yeung, 2005, page?).  In effect, he \nsuggests that we must understand how internationalization leads to the creation of new \nopportunities for profitability in addition to those OLI advantages described by Dunning \nand Norman (1983, 1987).  \n 8 \nIn the rest of this paper we, therefore, use the example of global headhunters to \nargue that the logic underlying the internationalization of producer services can be \ndeepened by investigating the complex ways firms use several modes of \ninternationalization to create different organizational forms over time and space so as to \npenetrate and create new intermediary geographical markets. \n \n3. Examining the internationalization of headhunters \nEmerging principally from the USA, headhunters claim to specialise in finding and \nrecruiting the most suitable individuals for senior managerial or board level vacancies, \nwhich normally means targeting individuals that are not actually in the market for a new \njob (Jones, 1989).  In so doing, they bring together ideas and practices associated with \nthe three constitutive actors of the \u2018cultural circuit of capitalism\u2019 (Thrift 1997): business \nconsultancy (more typically associated with management consultants themselves); \nexecutive education and training (more typically associated with that offered by MBA \nprogrammes in leading business schools); and, \u2018star\u2019 executives (similar to the ideas of \nmanagement gurus themselves).  \nThe industry has a relatively short institutional history.  Dating back to the \neconomic boom of the post-1950s in the USA, it was from the 1970s that headhunters \nproliferated and the \u2018big four\u2019 were established (Heidrick and Struggles [1953], Spencer \nStuart [1956], Russell Reynolds [1969] and Korn\/Ferry [1969]) (Jenn, 2005).  \nImportantly, the vast majority of these firms were started by management consultants. \nThis is not, however, a simple linear history of steady growth and internationalization \n(Simms, 2003).  Rather, it can be traced through: organic growth (post-1960s); merger \nand acquisition (M&A) behaviour (post-1970s); and, the creation of alliances\/networks \nwith independent firms (post-1980s). This paper uses this schematic history to \nunderstand why, how and where headhunters internationalized to deliver their \n 9 \nintermediary role in spatially differentiated elite labour markets, thereby informing our \nwider understanding of the knotty, nuance-filled and constantly changing forms of \ninternationalization in producer services, as well as the institutional geographies and \nbiographies of the \u2018cultural circuit of capital\u2019 more broadly.  \n \n3.1 The headhunting industry \nThe executive search industry is dominated by twenty firms whose combined revenues \ntotalled more than US$2,500m in 2004 (table 3).  Jenn (2005) estimates that the top ten \nof these firms alone accounted for one third of the global executive search market in \n2004.  These \u2018top ten\u2019 are \u2018retained\u2019 headhunting organizations: organizations selected \nby clients who have an executive position to fill and paid a fee (circa 33% of the \ncandidate\u2019s salary) to manage search and selection.  However, whilst fundamentally all \noffering the same service, it is important to recognise that different firms have their own \nunique executive search cultures and styles (Jones, 1989).  Distinctions can be made \nbetween specialist boutiques that concentrate on headhunting in a limited number of \nsectors (e.g. Penrhyn International) and integrated \u2018complete service\u2019 corporations that \noffer executive search in any major industry (e.g. Korn\/Ferry) (table 3).  As with other \nproducer services, a long \u2018tail\u2019 exists with firms that have some form of \u2018international\u2019 \noperation (circa 5,000 firms [Jenn, 2005]).  \n \n3.2 Rationales for internationalization  \nThree principle considerations lead to the internationalization of global headhunting \nfirms: \n3.2.1. Demand conditions. Demand-led internationalization came from clients \nthemselves internationalizing and requiring services in overseas locations, which \ngathered pace from the late-1960s as new demand was created from the burgeoning \n 10 \ninternationalization of other services in the world economy, especially advanced \nproducer services (see Economist, 1990; Sassen, 1988). Headhunters responded to this \nchange in demand conditions which was occurring, in particular outside of the USA, \nthrough FDI (e.g. Heidrick & Struggles opened an international office in 1968, Spencer \nStuart in 1961, Russell Reynolds in 1971 and Korn\/Ferry in 1973). Simultaneously, \nthere was also the copycat growth of European firms (e.g. Egon Zehnder from Zurich in \n1964; Whitehead Mann from London in 1971). This increase in demand for \nheadhunting was also intertwined with three further factors.   \nFirst, the decline in the belief that employees should \u2018serve their time\u2019 in the \norganization. Acknowledgement grew of the value of \u2018mobile talent\u2019: individuals \nbought in from outside of the firm because of their skills and expertise (see Sennett \n[1998] on the career challenges posed to professionals by the end of job security for life \nand Thrift 2000).  In part, this mirrors the changing rhetoric of producer services \u2013 to \n\u2018poach\u2019 a rival\u2019s leading manager sends a strong signal to shareholders, the stock \nmarkets and other firms, that the company \u2018means business\u2019 and will stop at nothing in \nits quest for profit maximisation.  Moreover, in some sectors, if the successful candidate \nfor an executive position is \u2018in-house\u2019 there are murmurings of imminent failure and \nlack of innovation.  For example, in November 2005, the leading investment bank, \nHSBC, announced that its retiring Chairman was to be replaced by Stephen Green, the \nthen Chief Executive of HSBC\u2019s UK division, sparking accusations from the national \nmedia that the bank was \u2018playing safe\u2019 (The Daily Telegraph, 2005).  Second, the \nacknowledgement that the use of an \u2018old-boy network\u2019 to recruit senior executives was \ninefficient and unsuitable in the \u2018new\u2019 business environment.  Instead it was recognised \n 11 \nthat a more scientific and objective strategy was needed because, \u201cbusiness has become \ntoo complicated, and the stakes have become too high, for a board chairman who needs \nexecutive talent to rely on his friends or his friends\u2019 recommendations\u201d (Jones, 1989, \n19).  However, it is important to note that the most vocal proponents of the \u2018objective\u2019 \nnature of dedicated headhunters have been the leading headhunting firms themselves.  \nThird, the rapid growth of other producer services and, more recently, new \ntechnological and bioscience activities generated unprecedented demands for new \n\u2018executive\/expert\u2019 labour.  Evidence for the growing importance of these new executive \nsearch sectors can be found in the dramatic rise of pharmaceutical, life sciences and \ntechnology areas (e.g. 33% of Korn\/Ferry\u2019s annual revenue in 2004 came from health \ncare, life sciences and technology [Jenn, 2005]).  \nHowever, this is not the simple demand-supply style of response often \nconceptualised in theories of the internationalization of producer services (e.g. Bryson \net al, 2004).  Rather, headhunters were both responding to demand but also actively \nreproducing it through their market-making practices.  The rhetoric used by these firms \nwas and still is integral to creating demand for externally recruited, talented rather than \nwell connected, industry-skilled individuals.  This is encapsulated in the way the firm \nHeidrick & Struggles first attracted clients when established in the USA.  In 1953, \nGardner Heidrick and John Struggles sent out business cards to firms in the Midwest of \nthe USA promoting their services and the revolution they offered.  This was the first use \nof \u2018market-making rhetoric\u2019 by headhunters and continues today. The same firm\u2019s \nwebsite \u2013 the modern day equivalent of  business card distribution  \u2013 trumpets that \u201cAs \ninnovators we are actively redefining top-level search to encompass complementary \nservices that help build strong companies and the leaders of tomorrow\u201d \n(www.Heidrick.com, accessed 17\/01\/06).  \n 12 \n3.2.2. Over-coming self-regulation The need to overcome off-limits market blockages \nwas also instrumental in driving executive search firms to internationalise.  The off-\nlimits rule in headhunting dictates that, for two years, no member of an executive search \nfirm may approach: (a) an individual recruited for a client as part of another project; or \n(b) any individual working for a firm who has been a client.  However, this can create a \n\u2018blockage\u2019 problem.  Over time, a successful firm will serve several firms within one \nindustry and, as a result, create blockages in the form of a majority of firms that cannot \nbe used to source candidates for vacancies.  This restricts their success at recruiting the \nmost suitable individuals.   \nInternationalization has been used as one strategy to avoid this problem. \nHeadhunting as an industry is lightly regulated with no legally or professionally \nenforceable codes of conduct. The only form of self-regulation that does exist is \nprovided by the Association of Executive Search Consultants (AESC).  Firms, rather \nthan individual headhunters, become members after a series of \u2018good practice\u2019 measures \nare met in terms of how they manage client and headhunted relationships (Jenn, 2005).  \nThese measures are not legally enforceable and in many ways the role of the AESC is \nmore of an attempt to institutionalize headhunters as a \u2018respectable\u2019 profession in its \nown right.  To this end, the AESC provides on going training for members, regular \nbulletins of industry developments and emphasizes the increased visibility within the \nprofession member firms can enjoy (see www.aesc.org). Unsurprisingly then, although \nthe \u2018off limits\u2019 rule is widely adhered to in the industry as part of ethical guidelines for \nexecutive search (Konecki, 1999), firms have looked for ways to circumvent the \n\u2018blockage\u2019 problems it creates. Internationalization has meant firms can operate policies \n 13 \nthat place clients off-limits only to headhunters working in the offices that served the \nclient (Jenn, 1993, 48).  This means that, for example, although the firm has worked for \nPriceWaterhouseCoopers in the USA, the UK office can still recruit candidates from the \nfirm.  This is a key \u2018spatial economy\u2019 (Yeung, 2005).  \n3.1.3. Market intermediation. Finally, the opportunity to expand the scope of the \nheadhunters\u2019 intermediary\u2019s marketplace has also driven the internationalization of \nexecutive search firms.  Whilst the disintermediation of many services has been \nreported, in particular due to the rise of the internet (Leyshon and Pollard, 2000), the \nexecutive search industry has actually entrenched its position as an essential \nintermediary through internationalization.  To explain this phenomenon requires further \nunderstanding of the socially constructed nature of elite labour search practice (and in \nparticular chief executive recruitment) in the contemporary business world. This has \ntwo dimensions.   \nFirst, as the candidates identified by headhunters are often already employed, \nfrequently by one of the client\u2019s rivals, searches are necessarily covert.  It is essential \nthat: (a) the current employer of a potential candidate does not become aware that their \nstar is about to be poached; and (b) that candidates do not know which firm is \nheadhunting them until they are committed to the point of being interviewed for the \npost.  The latter point is important so that, in particular, institutional investors are \nprevented from gaining knowledge of the preferred candidate for board vacancies in \nstock exchange listed firms.  Then, if the firm fails to secure one of the preferred \ncandidates, negative analyst\u2019s reports suggesting a \u2018second choice\u2019 candidate was \nrecruited are avoided.  Indeed, the covert nature of the headhunting industry is \nsymptomatic of the heightened competition experienced by producer service firms in \ncontemporary advanced capitalist economies (Thrift 1997).  Managers are constantly \ninvolved in efforts to maintain their competitive edge vis-\u00e0-vis corporate rivals and \n 14 \nconsequently carefully manage press releases relating to significant executive staffing \nchanges to maximise the value of such appointments to the firm. \nThis mysterious world of headhunting was alien to almost all but the US \nmarketplace prior to the internationalization of headhunters.  However, by \ninternationalizing, executive search firms introduced both the idea of \u2018poaching\u2019 the \nmost suitable candidate when necessary and the secretive practice described above \n(Finlay and Coverdill, 2002).  In addition, they were also able to spread the belief that, \nfor potential candidates, an approach from an executive search firm holds more \nlegitimacy than an approach from the firm with a vacancy itself.  Both the initial \nanonymity of not knowing whose vacancy is being discussed and the belief that dealing \nwith headhunters is acceptable means headhunters are more successful at attracting \ninterest from the most suitable candidates.  Khurana (2002, 140) quotes one of his \ninterviewees as suggesting that \u201cThere is a big difference in taking a call from an \nexecutive search firm than [sic] taking a call from another firm, especially a \ncompetitor\u2026talking to a director is a whole new ball game\u2026and a serious one\u201d.   \nThe second way in which headhunters have created themselves an \nintermediary\u2019s role in the elite labour search process is by promoting the idea that they \nare more objective than extant board members and recruiters within firms.  The rhetoric \nwhich executive search firms use to sell their services is now well established: \n\u201cOur people cannot be duplicated. Each recruiter comes to us with experience in \nsearch and, most often, experience in the industry they will serve. They are the \nbest trained in the search business. Using a fine blend art and science our \nrecruiters find the right leaders for our clients\u2014the art of judgment acquired \nduring years of industry and search experience combined with the science of our \nprocess and systems\u201d (http:\/\/www.russellreynolds.com\/2005\/aboutus.asp, \naccessed 17\/01\/06). \n 15 \nHeadhunters benefited from internationalization by spreading the idea that for elite \nlabour search, and especially chief executive search, to be legitimate, firms must \nemploy the knowledge and skill of headhunters to guarantee the best candidate is found.  \nAs Khurana (2002, 148) notes, firms recruiting elite labour, \u201cfeel a sense of fiduciary \nresponsibility\u2026The signaling of legitimacy that the engagement of an ESF [executive \nsearch firm] accomplishes in an external CEO search\u201d.   \nIn many ways, then, headhunters resemble the intermediaries Peck and Theodore \n(2001) and Peck et al., (2005) identified in the form of temporary staffing agencies.  By \nacting as intermediaries, like temping agencies, headhunters create  their own market, in \nessence, allowing the \u2018stretching of the envelope\u2019 and the \u2018remaking of the rules\u2019 of \nelite labour search.  The firms are active institutional agents that, through their activities \nand the reproduction of the embedded ideas and rhetoric-driven norms outlined above, \nrender involvement in global executive labour search through executive search firms \nunavoidable for employers and skilled individuals alike  A central element in the \ninternationalization strategies is to promulgate the idea of headhunting as a desirable \nand profitable business service as well as the actual practice of headhunting.   This is a \nfurther factor that cannot be accounted for within the OLI framework, but is an \nimportant dimension in the internationalization of headhunters, and as Peck and \ncolleagues have shown (Peck et al., 2005), in the growth of other producer services \ninvolved in the reproduction of contemporary labour markets of different kinds.   The \nidea that internationalization might also allow the creation of (as well as response to \nexisting) advantages is further explored and discussed in the next section of the paper \nwhere we offer amendments to extant internationalization theory relating to advanced \nproducer services firms through recognition of the market-making advantages gained \nfrom opening overseas offices.         \n \n 16 \n4. The internationalization of headhunters: initial strategies \nWe can further see the way the guiding logic of internationalization in headhunting \nfirms is under-laid and influenced by the possibility of the creation of new benefits for \nheadhunting intermediaries services by examining the two initial modes of \ninternationalization used: organic-growth and M&A activity1. The following discussion \ndemonstrates that headhunting firms use different organisation strategies in different \nmarkets.  In part, these strategies can be seen as a response to the particular labour \nmarket conditions and related client demands of different markets.  However, they also \nrepresent attempts by headhunters to maxmise the potential profitability of any given \nmarket.  \n4.1. Organic growth \nOrganic growth began in the 1960s. For the first time, producer service firms found \nthemselves unable to fill management positions through internal labour markets.  \nConsequently, demand for externally recruited talent increased at rates exceeding the \nreadily available supply of executives seeking new positions (Jones, 1989). \nHeadhunting, as a complementary service function, therefore, began to emerge within \nthe \u2018cultural circuit of capital\u2019.  This, however, rapidly evolved, with newly formed \nheadhunting firms relatively quickly engaging in internationalization to serve their \nclients overseas. They deployed a predominately multinational office structure with \neach office operating independently and serving the national market within which it was \nlocated.  For example, Heidrick and Struggles International was formed in 1953 by \nGardner Heidrick and John Struggles in Chicago and only served clients in the \nAmerican Midwest until 1957.  The company then expanded into the US national \n                                            \n1\n The third and most recent mode of internationalization involves the organization of firms into \nnetworks\/strategic alliances, with members of the network being independent firms in other international \nlocations formed in order to reduce cost structures, over come \u2018off-limits\u2019 barriers and ease the task of \ncross-border searches without the requirement of wholly-owned international office networks (e.g. Globe, \nITP Worldwide).  Those headhunters who organised the penetration of international markets through \n\u2018best friend\u2019 networks and alliances are discussed at length in section 6 of the paper, which focuses on the \ncontemporary organisation of the industry (and importantly, thus minimising repetition here). \n 17 \nmarket by opening offices in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York before \nexpanding into the UK with the opening of its London office in 1968 (see \nhttp:\/\/www.heidrick.com\/About\/History\/History.htm, accessed 18\/08\/05).  \nThroughout this period, the expansion of specialist US headhunting firms into \nEurope was common, exemplified by the opening of offices in London by the \u2018big four\u2019 \n(Heidrick and Struggles [1968], Spencer Stuart [1961], Russell Reynolds [1971] and \nKorn\/Ferry [1973]. These firms quickly institutionalised their practice of elite labour \nsearch, something that, in particular, meant many of the City\u2019s brokerages, securities \nhouses and merchant banks began to use the service of headhunters. This involved both \nthe \u2018importing\u2019 of practices from the USA (with expatriates playing an important role) \nyet also their reflexive conditioning in relation to the London market. As part of this \nprocess the now normal client-wooing approaches associated with advanced producer \nfirms such as \u2018hospitality\u2019 events, client relationship cultivation through seminars, and \nnetworking via professional bodies became integral to reproducing demand for, and \nraising awareness of, headhunters\u2019 work.   An added benefit of internationalization also \nexisted in that, by using the strategy described in section two, the London office could \nheadhunt an individual even if they worked for a previous client of the Chicago office \nsince London was seen as a separate \u2018entity\u2019 with \u2018Chinese walls\u2019 between consultants.  \n \n4.2. Mergers and acquisitions (M&As)  \nFrom the late 1970s, a wave of M&As characterised the leading firms in the industry.  \nFor example, at the end of the 1970s Korn\/Ferry entered Latin America through a \nmerger with the Mexico based Hazzard and Associados (1977), followed by Sydney \nthrough a merger with Guy Pease Associates (1979), thereby establishing an \nAustralasian business (table 4).  Its European business was strengthened by its merger \nwith the Brussels\u2019 firm, Carre Orban (1993) who had an extensive office network in \n 18 \nScandinavia (Jenn 2005).  This period of rapid growth is reflected in companies\u2019 \nrevenue and profit figures as both the geographical marketplace served and volume of \ntrade in each proliferated.  Korn\/Ferry saw fee income in the UK rise from \u00a3501,461 in \n1980 to \u00a31,761,405 in 1985 (Jones, 1989, 27) and its European offices charged over \u00a313 \nmillion in fees alone in 1990 (Tully, 1990). \nThis M&A growth was vital for consolidating the organic multinational \napproach.  However, the example of Korn\/Ferry demonstrates how firms sought to enter \nnew markets in relatively low risk ways by acquiring firms that already had the specific \nknowledge (e.g. informal best practice methods that clients would expect from the firm) \nto complete a headhunting deal in each national marketplace. The existence of \nindigenous European headhunting firms clearly showed the presence of market demand \nfor headhunting. This was very different to earlier rounds of internationalization when \norganic office openings were the only way to enter markets such as London where \nheadhunting as a practice was underdeveloped. For example, when Korn\/Ferry opened \nits office in London in 1973 the UK firm Whitehead Mann had only been operating for \ntwo years. Established markets were better served by, in the first instance, responding to \nextant demand conditions through a M&A approach. Once acquired however, the \nknowledge of the local firm could be exploited and the headhunting marketplace \ndeveloped with the gradual imposition of the US style strategies used by firms like \nKorn\/Ferry where appropriate. When the M&A approach to internationalization was \nadopted, then, it was in response to potential limits to market reproduction, in this case \nthe existence of headhunting practices and institutional norms in countries that had to be \nunderstood in order to further develop the marketplace.  \n \n5. Contemporary architectures and geographies of transnational headhunters \n5.1 From multinational to transnational architectures \n 19 \nAs business levels grew still further, the repertoire of organizational strategies and \n\u2018spatial economies\u2019 adopted by global headhunters diversified significantly. The period \nfrom the mid-1990s onwards saw headhunting firms move increasingly from the \u2018multi-\nnational\u2019 office towards a more \u2018transnational\u2019 form, characterised by cooperation \nbetween offices such that knowledge and business practices diffuse throughout the \noffice network, rather than being defined and produced in each office, (Cuthbertson, \n1996; Jenn, 2005).  For headhunting firms, this change was in many ways a mimetic \nprocess in response to wider developments in the business environment. During this \nperiod an increased level of global mobility developed in elite labour markets whereby \nthe boundaries between national labour markets became porous (Beaverstock 2006) and \ntransnational interconnection became common in all advanced producer services in \nresponse to client demands (Baschi-Sen and Sen, 1997).  Consequently, headhunting \nfirms saw the need to find ways to more effectively serve global clients and to exploit \nglobal elite labour flows. Recruiting for a vacancy from \u2018global\u2019 labour markets using \ntransnational integration between offices provided the solution.  This differed from past \npractice of only recruiting from within the country where the vacancy existed and meant \nthat the multinational strategy used previously was unsuitable. By this time, the leading \nglobal firms were each conducting more than 4000 global searches per annum \n(Executive Grapevine 2004) and global labour markets required firms to have a wider \ngeographical reach. \nA further important development can be identified that also contributed to this \nperiod of strategic change in executive search firm\u2019s strategies. On the client demand \nside, the market for elite labour has changed with the increasing importance of the \nrhetoric of the \u2018knowledge economy\u2019 in advanced capitalist economies (see Fast \nCompany, 2000).  This further intensification of demand for talented individuals to fill \nexecutive and boardroom vacancies has reinforced the emergence of new international \n 20 \ngeographies of elite labour search: \u201cthe hunt for the global manager is on.  From \nAmsterdam to Yokohama, recruiters are looking for a new breed of multilingual, \nmultifaceted executive who can map strategy for the whole world\u201d (Tully, 1990, 30).  \nHeadhunters benefited from the rhetoric associated with the knowledge economy and, \nincreasingly, became involved in its reproduction. If clients believe finding executives \nis a skilled, demanding task that needs to be undertaken quickly and efficiently to \nmaintain their competitive edge, they are more likely to invest in appointing an \nexecutive search firm.  As such, headhunters are involved in a constant effort to ensure \ntheir (potential) clients recognize the value of using a headhunter, and literally \u2018buy \ninto\u2019 the rhetoric that a search without a headhunter will be sub-optimal.   \nThis resonates with Thrift\u2019s (1997) work on soft-capitalism in which it is argued \nthat business more generally has become increasingly \u2018knowledgeable\u2019 in an effort to \nrespond to the twin challenges of greater uncertainty and competition.  Headhunters are \nimportant actors in this phenomenon since they rely on clients knowing and \nunderstanding what they do and the value of their work to source business.  In short, \nthere is no inevitability that businesses will use headhunters, but headhunters constantly \nstrive to promote their industry as if there were no alternative in order to develop their \nmarket intermediary functions. The latest market-reproduction strategy of headhunters \nis, then, to promote transnationally integrated search through integrated office networks.  \nAs one firm suggests in its promotional literature, \u201cThe Amrop Hever Group was \nformed in the millennium year 2000 to serve more efficiently regional and international \nclients in light of the growing trend of globalization. As a result of the merger, the \nGroup can now offer decades of combined senior level search experience covering six \ncontinents\u201d (http:\/\/www.amrop.com\/aboutus.html, accessed 17\/01\/06).  \n \n5.2. Geographies of headhunting marketplaces, 1992-2005 \n 21 \nWe can see the consequences of these transnational processes in the architecture of firm \nstructure in the newer geographies of contemporary headhunting firm office structures. \nBy 2005, the leading 15 global headhunters had increased their number of offices by \n48% since 1992, from 461 to 684, with substantial absolute growth in Europe, North \nAmerica and the Asian-Pacific (table 5).  Such growth in offices was particularly \nassociated with the very large firms (Jones, 1989).  For example, five of the consistently \nranked global top six headhunters had increased their regional office networks by 173% \nfrom 100 offices to 273, between 1987 and 2005 (table 6).  With respect to relative \noffice change, it is interesting to note the growing prominence of South America, Asia-\nPacific, and the Middle-East and Africa (tables 5 and 6), which reflects increased \ngrowth beyond established offices in Buenos Aires, Sao Paulo, Mexico City, Hong \nKong, Singapore, Melbourne, Sydney, Tokyo and Johannesburg between the 1990s and \n2000s. We can further understand how this relates to the creation and reproduction of \ntransnational headhunting marketplaces by looking at city-specific geography of the \ninternationalization of the top 15 global headhunters from 1992 to 2005.  In 1992, the \ntop 15 firms had 461 offices in 111 cities across the world (figure 1).  By 2005, they had \n684 offices in 152 cities (figure 2), representing net increases of 48% in the number of \noffices (+223) and 37% in the number of cities with a direct presence (+41) (table 7). \nThe most significant office growth occurred in Santiago (+8 new offices), Shanghai \n(+8), Miami (+7), Beijing (+6) and New Delhi (+5).   \nThe major geographies of the internationalization of headhunters in cities which \nhave more than five offices are ranked in tables 8 and 9.  In 1992, Paris and Milan, New \nYork, Sao Paulo and Hong Kong were the principal regional cities for the top 15 \nheadhunting firms.  In terms of city-office concentration, of the 111 cities on the map, \n33% (28 cities with 37 offices) had five or more offices, with 21 cities (from 54) \naccounting for 78% (192) of all offices (Table 8).  By 2005, this geography of \n 22 \nconcentration had proliferated with 40% of the 152 cities (61) having five or more \noffices, with many more five-office or over cities in Latin America (+5 cities [+250%]) \nand the Asia-Pacific (+9 cities [+180%]) than in 1992 (table 8 and 9).  The remaining \nnet offices (+112) were opened in already established 1992 cities, with Warsaw (+9 \noffices), Istanbul (+ 7), Mumbai (+6), Amsterdam (+5), Moscow (+5), Buenos Aires \n(+5), Barcelona (+4), Dublin (+4), Boston (+4), Chicago (+4), Toronto (+4), Sao Paulo \n(+4) and Singapore (+4), all experiencing relatively high absolute office growth.  \n Turning back to table 7, combined with tables 8 and 9, we can interpret and \nidentify a number of patterns in these data: (i) the consolidation of office growth in a \nlarge number of established Western European and North American cities, and in a \nsmall number of established Latin American and Pacific-Asian cities, consistently atop \nof tables 8 and 9; (ii) significant spurts of office growth in new opening city-markets of \nEastern Europe, Latin America, East Asia for example, where there would have been \nnone or only one office previously (e.g. Caracas, Warsaw, Moscow; Bangkok; Jakarta; \nMumbai); and, (iii) significant new organic growth in the burgeoning emerging markets \nof China (e.g. Shanghai), India (e.g. New Delhi), Latin America (e.g. Lima) and the oil \nstates (e.g. Dubai). This mimic\u2019s surprisingly well the recent globalization of law firms \nand points to the fact that, again, headhunters have created their marketplaces by \nresponding to and reproducing the behaviors and strategies of other advanced producer \nservices. For example, since 1992 Allen & Overy, a UK-based global law firm, has like \nheadhunting firms concentrated its internationalization strategy on: (i) Western \nEuropean and North American cities (e.g. Amsterdam and Frankfurt); (ii) Eastern \nEurope and Asia (e.g. Warsaw, Moscow); and (iii) emerging markets (e.g. Beijing and \nShanghai).  Other global law firms such as Clifford Chance and Baker and McKenzie \nhave exhibited similar patterns of internationalization. This can be seen, then, as basic \n\u2018follow the client\u2019 internationalization by headhunters but also, more importantly to our \n 23 \nargument here, as indicative of how all advanced producer services engage in \u2018market-\nmaking\u2019 as well as \u2018market exploiting\u2019 internationalization strategies. The geographical \nexpansion of headhunting marketplaces has, as a result, required transnational strategies \nto be implemented to enter into both mature and emergent headhunting marketplaces.  \nInevitably, markets in leading \u2018world city\u2019 environments such as Paris exhibit great \npotential for the development of a headhunting marketplace whereas others, such as \nNew Delhi or Lima require more active market-making strategies.  Consequently, an \nintricate \u2018differentiated network\u2019 form became important for headhunters during this \nperiod. We, therefore, now briefly review the three concurrent organizational forms in \nwhich global headhunting firms are engaging in such transnational operations (table 3). \nThis further reveals the complexity of internationalization logic and the need to \nunderstand the \u2018spatial economies\u2019 and market-making opportunities created by \ninternationalization.  \n \n6. Contemporary transnational headhunting typologies \n6.1 The wholly-owned firm  \nThis is a transnational form managed by either an executive board or partnership that \ndefines priorities and strategies for all offices (as defined by Bartlett and Ghoshal, 1998) \nEach office acts as a \u2018branch\u2019 of the global firm, using the organisation\u2019s name and \nbeing tightly coupled economically, socially and culturally to other offices, where \ntechnology, accounting and financial procedures and training programmes are shared \nbetween all offices within the company.  Headhunters aim to foster ongoing, long-term \nrelationships with large transnational clients so that whenever they need to use a \nheadhunter, they automatically turn to them, rather than accepting pitches from a \nnumber of different firms. The fact that all offices use the same brand name and \ncorporate culture allows clients to trust that they will receive the same level and type of \n 24 \nservice wherever their executive search is in demand.  As Spencer Stuart suggests, \n\u201c[We] draw our energy and creativity from working together. As a global firm, we \nfoster teamwork through our highly effective international practice structure, while \nretaining strong local capabilities in each of our 50 offices\u201d \n(http:\/\/www.spencerstuart.co.uk\/about\/values\/, accessed 2\/06\/05). In addition, the \nowned firm is able to share successful practices and strategies in the form of \u2018know-\nhow\u2019 management. These are then used to improve services and create demand in each \nmarket. Offices also share lists of \u2018headhunted\u2019 executives between offices such that \nthey maximise the number of people they can offer to their clients in the shortlist, \ncolloquially known as the \u2018beauty parade\u2019.   \n \n6.2 The networked firm  \nThe networked transnational firm brings together several independent (often single \noffice non-global) headhunting firms in a strategic alliance to meet a client\u2019s global elite \nlabour search.  Networks are not businesses in themselves, but architectures linking \nsingle country firms together into a global network of \u2018best friends\u2019 that can perform \nlabour searches across many nations when needed.  Firms call on other members of the \nnetwork when they need an overseas search. Consequently there will often be several \nmembers of a network operating in one country, competing for the same business. \nHeadhunting networks are temporary and dynamic inter-firm coalitions that grow \nthrough repetitive use.  There is no long-term lock-in to these collaborations, thus \nallowing the member firms the flexibility to draw on the resources and knowledge base \nof the most suitable firm in the network (in terms of their database of candidates and \nknowledge of nationally distinct employment legalities and practices).   \nThe advantages of network alliances are aptly stated by the Globe Search Group, \nthe leading network in 2005, \u201c[B]y combining international reach with regional \n 25 \nexcellence, the Globe Search Group expertly supplies the resources, experience and \nknowledge in the identification of key executives internationally\u201d \n(http:\/\/www.globesearchgroup.com\/, accessed 2\/06\/05).  Two distinctive features of the \nway networked firms organize to deliver internationalized headhunting can be \nidentified.  First, they tend to have a lead institution that manages the relationships \nbetween the member firms, sets the parameters of business practice and makes decisions \nabout new entrants into the network.  For example, Globe Search Group was founded \nby the Chairman of the UK based Miles Partnership in 1997 and remains headquartered \nin London. Second, the so-called \u2018off limits\u2019 problem fails to emerge in any significant \nway.  In the network, it is possible to select a partner for a search who is not locked-out \nfrom selecting the most suitable candidates as a result of having completed searches \nrecently for the key firms in the field. The network also allows firms to have a toe-hold \nin an emerging market without exposing themselves to the full risk of establishing a \nnew market as would be the case in the wholly owned firm.   \n6.3 The hybrid firm \nThe hybrid is part of a formalised global alliance bringing initially independent firms \ntogether to trade under one corporate name but operate as independent businesses, \nconsequently blurring the boundary between transnational and multinational \norganisational forms. Hybrids involve tighter integration than in a network with only \none office in each country and shared standards and approaches existing across the \nalliance.  However, it is not as culturally, socially or economically integrated as the \nwholly owned firm.  Hybridity eliminates the potential for competition between \ndifferent member firms operating in the same country as might be the case in the \nnetwork, although it does not allow as much flexibility for the independent businesses \nin terms of how they actually go about the search or how they avoid off-limits issues.  \nIn each independent business, specialisms may be offered by function or sector.  These \n 26 \nspecialisms are organised at the individual office level with each office having an \nexpertise. Amrop Hever summarises the advantages being a hybrid: \n\u201cthe \u2026 group operates as a tight-knit global partnership of individually owned \nfirms that produces client advantage from unsurpassed local market knowledge \nwhether in New Delhi, Malmo or Melbourne.  Our policies, strategies and high \nquality standards all are centrally mandated and monitored.  We speak over 100 \nlanguages but always with a single voice\u201d (www.amrop.com\/aboutus.html, \naccessed 18\/08\/05). \nIn the hybrid approach, benefit can be gleaned from the network-wide reproduction of \ncertain norms but also local conditioning of strategies when local practices are \u2018thickly\u2019 \ninstitutionally embedded.  \n6.4 Blurred typologies  \nOf course, in practice, firms adopt a suite of different approaches simultaneously as they \nboth respond to client need and build their own market.    A well-developed example of \nthis heterogeneous organisational form is found in Korn\/Ferry. Predominately, \nKorn\/Ferry operates as a wholly-owned firm (table 3), however, on closer examination, \nin certain geographic markets it adopts three other organisational strategies \u2013 what it \nterms the alliance, the satellite and the affiliate office.  The only affiliate offices are \nlocated in Mexico City and Monterrey.  They are reminiscent of the hybrid office \nstructure since they trade under the Korn\/Ferry name but have a greater degree of \nautonomy than wholly-owned offices.  Its satellite offices are located in Quito and \nAuckland.  This organisational form lies between the hybrid and the network since \nagain they operate under the Korn\/Ferry name, but in the case of the Auckland office, it \nis in competition with Korn\/Ferry\u2019s wholly-owned office in Wellington.  Finally, \nalliance offices resemble the network organisational form since they trade under their \nown name and are located in the \u2018high\u2019 risk emerging markets of headhunting.  For \n 27 \nexample, in Africa, Korn\/Ferry runs their operation through an alliance established with \nthe Johannesburg company Leaders Unlimited (2003).  This limits the exposure \nKorn\/Ferry has in a comparatively new headhunting market but ensures that it is well \nplaced to take advantage of future developments in the region. It shows how strategy \ncan also be used when reproducing marketplaces and, in particular, how a blurred \ntypology is a valuable way of engaging in internationalization that responds to locally \nvariegated opportunities for market reproduction.   \n \n7. Discussion: advancing theories of internationalization in advanced producer \nservices \nOur investigation of the proliferation of global headhunting firms in the world economy \nmakes in-depth inroads into informing a wider understanding of the complexities of the \nwhy, how and where of internationalization and the different ways in which \u2018spatial \neconomies\u2019 are created as firms intermediate in geographical market places.  In so \ndoing, we have also drawn attention to an understudied activity within Thrift\u2019s (1997) \n\u2018cultural circuit of capital\u2019. Three major observations shed light on the symbiotic link \nbetween internationalization and spatial economies in the headhunting industry, \nparticularly the way internationalization strategies use space to produce and reproduce \nmarkets for producer services as well as to respond to existing market opportunities.  \nFirst, we began by outlining the \u2018innovative\u2019 spatial strategy used by executive \nsearch firms to overcome the difficulties created by the \u2018off-limits\u2019 best practice \nguidelines.  By exploiting the existence, in principle at least, of \u2018Chinese walls\u2019 between \noffices, executive search firms are able to claim to follow best practice yet engage in \nlabour recruitment from recent clients.  This provides a clear example of the type of \n\u2018spatial economy\u2019 Yeung (2005) refers to as the \u2018market blockages\u2019 faced by executive \nsearch firms are cleared due to the internationalization practice.  This is illustrated by \n 28 \nthe exponential growth of revenues of executive search firms after internationalization.  \nWe returned to this argument and noted how different approaches can be used, \ndepending on the mode of internationalization used, and therefore the need to \nunderstand the motivations for, and various methods for creating, different types of \nspatial economy. \nSecond, we have demonstrated the need to couple examinations of the spurs of \ninternationalization (e.g. Dunning and Norman, 1983; 1987) with in-depth \nunderstanding of how firms internationalize.  Examining the history of the \ninternationalization of headhunting firms shows that both the spurs evolve over time, \nbut most importantly so do the strategies used.  We have shown that organic, M&A, \nnetwork and hybrid strategies are used at discrete moments in the internationalization \nprocess to create new markets from scratch, to rapidly expand into existing markets and \nto experiment and develop risky and immature (small) marketplaces respectively.  \nHowever, we stressed this is not a temporally linear process as many firms may engage \nin multiple modes of internationalization simultaneously reflecting the range of \nmarketplaces they are attempting to develop.  This is particularly important to \nheadhunting firms because of their \u2018intermediary\u2019 role and the need to cultivate a \n\u2018headhunting marketplace\u2019 in order to be successful.   \nThird, as was noted earlier, headhunting is a strategy with its roots in the USA.  \nThe organic office opening in Europe during the 1960\u2019s allowed, in particular the \u2018big \nfour\u2019, to export their US practice to the UK to serve existing US  and new European \nclients.  At the same time they were able to cultivate the awareness of and desire for \nheadhunting in European firms.  Without the reproduction of the intermediaries \nmarketplace they operate in, the firms would have limited business.  In other markets \nwhere US firms have not flocked in such large numbers, it is necessary to either tap into \nexisting executive search marketplaces (using M&A) or attempt to cultivate (through a \n 29 \nnetwork or hybrid form) such a market through the small headhunters who inevitably \noperate in a different style and at a different scale.  These points all highlight the need to \nunderstand how internationalization occurs and the reasons for choosing different \nstrategies. \nMost importantly, however, they demonstrate that the theorisation of the \ninternationalization of advanced producer services can be enhanced and moved forward \nby examining not only how firms internationalize to exploit pre-existing organizational, \nlocational or internal advantages, but by also examining how firms create new \nadvantages through spatial strategies.  Table 10 exemplifies this by reworking the \n\u2018eclectic paradigm\u2019 around the internationalization of headhunters and expanding \ndiscussions to include both the new advantages created (in particular by market \nreproduction) and the organizational forms used to exploit this.  As the elements \nhighlighted in bold (O3 and L4 and L5) demonstrate, recognising advantages created by \ninternationalization and coupling these to the \u2018why\u2019 and \u2018how\u2019 questions of \ninternationalization is crucial so as to explain the true complexity of, and the intricate \nstrategic decision making associated with, internationalization in advanced producer \nservice firms.       \n \n7. Conclusion       \nThis paper has used the understudied global headhunting industry to develop extant \nunderstandings of the internationalization of producer service firms.  Particular attention \nhas been drawn to the ways headhunters have used different organisational forms and \nstrategies at different times to both respond to client demand but also develop their own \nmarkets in ways most advantageous to themselves.  We have suggested that theories of \nproducer service firm internationalization need to acknowledge, and critically engage \nwith, the messy, intricate and complex set of practices and rhetorics that reproduce and \n 30 \nenable the business practice used by firms involved in different markets.  Indeed, the \ncase of headhunting demonstrates that it is too simplistic to assume internationalization \nis only about entering and serving extant demand in overseas marketplaces.  Instead, \ninternationalization can be seen as a spatial strategy (Yeung, 2005) that has various \nmodes of operation in order to most effectively allow both the reproduction of \nmarketplaces overseas but also, where relevant, their integration.  The \u2018eclectic \nparadigm\u2019 (Dunning and Norman, 1983; 1987) and Bartlett and Ghoshal\u2019s (1998) \ntypology alone might not allow such complexity to be integrated into analyses.    \nHowever, whilst this argument has considered the rise of an internationl headhunting \nindustry over the last fifty years or so, centring around its use of \u2018spatial economies\u2019 as \nwell as its concomitant role in promulgating ideas of \u2018soft capitalism\u2019, it would appear \nthat the story of innovation within the headhunting industry is far from complete.  \nLooking to the future, the trajectories of both low and high end labour market \nintermediaries will be interesting since they are both moving towards operating in \nmiddle management recruitment, despite their differing institutional biographies.  On \nthe one hand, as Peck et al (2005) demonstrate, temping agencies see the middle \nmanagement market as the source of higher returns.  On the other hand, as headhunters \ninstitutionalize the use of executive search and selection within producer service \nindustries, its use becomes more important (and expected by both the client firm and the \nheadhunted themselves) lower down the managerial hierarchy as a source of \nlegitimation and a sign of excellence.   \n The activities of Korn\/Ferry over recent years are indicative in this regard (Jenn, \n2005).  The firm initiated a virtual organic development through the launch of its \n\u2018Future Step\u2019 initiative in 1998.  This division concentrates on the recruiting of middle \nmanagement, as opposed to the elite recruitment that has typified the executive search \nindustry to date.  As such, it represents a clear example of active market-building by \n 31 \nKorn\/Ferry, using its existing knowledge of different national recruitment laws and \nnorms, and applying them to a new sector of the labour market.  It is also innovative in \nits reliance on electronic information transfer, as opposed to face-to-face meetings \nbetween the client and the headhunted.  The way \u2018spatial economies\u2019 develop in this \nnew form of headhunting will be intriguing and of significant importance for the \nrecruitment of executive labour throughout the globe.  However, regardless of whether \nthese sorts of initiatives are economically successful or not, labour market \nintermediaries beyond the temping industry studied to date by economic geographers, \ndeserve far more attention than they have hitherto enjoyed within the sub-discipline, not \nleast because of the insights they can shed on contemporary processes of corporate \ninternationalization strategy and form. \n \nAcknowledgements \nTBA \n 32 \nReferences \nAmin A, 2002, \u201cSpatialities of globalization\u201d Environment and Planning A 34 385-399 \nBagchi-Sen S, Sen, J, 1997, \u201cThe current state of knowledge in international business in \nproducer services\u201d Environment and Planning A 29 1153-1174. \nBartlett C, Ghoshal S, 1998 Managing Across Borders: The Transnational Solution \n(Random House, London) 3rd Edition \nBeaverstock J V, 2006, \u201cTransnational work: Global professional labour markets in \nprofessional service accounting firms\u201d, in The Handbook of Service Industries Eds J R \nBryson, P W Daniels (Edward Elgar, London) pp?? \nBeaverstock J V, Smith R, Taylor P J, 1999, \u201cThe long arm of the law: The \nglobalization of London's law firms\u201d Environment and Planning A 31 1857-1876 \nBoyle M, Findlay A, Lelievre E, Paddison R, 1996, \u201cWorld cities and the limits to \nglobal control: A case study of executive search firms in Europe\u2019s leading cities\u201d \nInternational Journal of Urban and Regional Research 20 498-517 \nBryson J, Daniels, P W, Warf B, 2004 Service Worlds (Routledge, London) \nCuthbertson N, 1996 The Geography of the International Headhunting Industry \nunpublished PhD thesis, Department of Geography, University of Bristol, Bristol \nThe Daily Telegraph 2005 HSBC plays safe with new Chairman 29 November, City \nsection, page 1 \nDicken P, 2003 Global Shift (Sage, London) 4th Edition \nDicken P, Kelly P F, Olds K, Yeung H W, 2001, \u201cChains and networks, territories and \nscales: towards a relational framework for analysing the global economy\u201d Global \nNetworks 1 99-123 \nDunning J H, Norman G, 1987, \u201cThe location choice of \n international companies\u201d Environment and Planning A 19 613-632. \nDunning J H, Norman G, 1983, \u201cThe theory of multinational \n 33 \n enterprise: An application of multinational office location\u201d Environment  \n and Planning A 15, 675-692. \nThe Economist, 1990, \u201cHeadhunting for the moneymen.
