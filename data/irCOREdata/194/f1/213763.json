Helsper  \nLecturer in Media and Communications  \nLondon School of Economics and Political Science  \nWord count (without references)=1,533 \n \nDigital exclusion is a hot topic in the UK at the moment. Charities and service providers working \nwith older people are concerned that this group is disproportionately excluded from services \noffered on digital platforms and research backs this up (DCLG, 2009; DCMS, 2009; Helsper, 2008).  \nDigital exclusion refers to those factors beyond a person\u2019s direct control that limit their access to \nand ability to use Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). This can be contrasted to \ndigital choice which refers to those who make a voluntary decision to disengage from ICTs. The \nmost frequently mentioned factors related to digital exclusion are low income, low education and \ndisabilities. Indicators of digital choice are negative attitudes towards technologies and a lack of \ninterest in engaging with digital content. In academic research and policy there has been a shift in \nrecent years towards looking at disengagement rather than exclusion. This means an emphasis on \nsocio-psychological factors in addition to economic and health factors that limit people\u2019s use of \nthe Internet.  \n \nThe Internet has come of age; costs of acquiring access have gone down, interfaces have become \nmore user-friendly and the range of available activities has gone up. The widespread integration of \nInternet based services into people\u2019s everyday lives, has led some to conclude that costs and skills \ncan no longer be reasons for disengagement from the use of the Internet. Everyone is now \nexpected to be \u2018online\u2019 and those who are not are labelled \u2018digital refuseniks\u2019. Since the elderly \nmake up the largest section of non-users of the Internet, only one third (34%) of those in \n 2 \nretirement use the Internet, it is important to understand if their disengagement is indeed a \nchoice or caused by exclusion.  \n \nProfiles of older users and non-users \nBased on the Oxford Internet Surveys (OxIS)1 a profile of the average older Internet user can be \nconstructed and compared with that of the average older non-user and the average younger user. \nPeople over 65 are different from those younger than 65 on a few key exclusion factors; they are \nmore likely to have a disability or health problem and have less disposable income. When \nexamining the profile of a typical older non-user of the Internet2 it becomes clear that what makes \nolder people disadvantaged in general also constitutes a disadvantage amongst those within the \nsame age group as regards digital engagement.  \n \nTypical Elderly Internet User \n \nBase: OxIS 2009. Internet users over 65 years old (N=124) \n \nTypical Elderly Non-User \n \nBase: OxIS 2009. Non-Users over 65 years old (N=263) \n \nThe figures above show a typical 65+ Internet user and a typical 65+ non-user. In comparison to \ntheir peers, older people who do not use the Internet are: \n                                               \n1\n The University of Oxford\u2019s OxIS is a biennial survey started in 2003 of a nationally representative survey of Britons \nover the age of 14. \n2\n The elderly non-users described in this article include both those who have never used the Internet before (63% of \nthose over 65) and those who had some experience but stopped using it (5% of those over 65). \n 3 \n\uf0b7 older (average age older non-user=74yrs v. Internet user=71yrs)  \n\uf0b7 socially isolated (55% lives alone v. 24%) \n\uf0b7 poor (56% in lowest income group v. 29%) \n\uf0b7 female (55% v. 34%) \n\uf0b7 with health problems (41% v. 18%) \n\uf0b7 less familiar with ICTs (eg. 25% text messages at least monthly v. 60% of Internet users) \n\uf0b7 negative about ICTs  \n \nReasons for non-use \nGiven that the group of elderly non-users is disadvantaged in terms of health and income one \nmight expect that the important reasons for them to disengage from the Internet are costs and a \nlack of ICT skills.  \n \nReasons given for disengagement from the internet by older people \nNot for me\n12%\nLack of \nskill\/ability\n11%\nConcerns about \nprivacy and \ninformation \noverload\n5%\nDon't have \nAccess\n7%\nHigh costs\n3%\nLack of \nInterest\n62%\n \nBase: Non-Users over 65 (N=259) \n 4 \n \nWhen older people were asked about their reasons for disengaging, costs and access are rarely \nmentioned. Instead, they cite a lack of interest and unsuitability for people like them. To a certain \nextent one can expect these answers, it is easier to say that you are not interested than to admit \nthat you do not know how to or do not have the money to afford using the Internet.  \nEase with ICTs \nNevertheless, a lack of skill was relatively important for disengaging; older people feel \nuncomfortable with ICTs in general. \n \nTypical statements of elderly non-users compared to those of elderly users \n \nBase: Non-Users of the Internet older than 65 (N=259) compared to Internet Users over 65 (BN=124). \n \nThe concerns about ICTs expressed above are relatively common, even those who use the Internet \nbelieve that it can be addictive (73% older users). However, typically users are more positive about \nthe possibilities that the Internet in particular and ICTs in general offer than non-users.  \n \nI get nervous using \ntechnologies, because I \nmight break something \n(57% v. 27%) \nOften it is easier to do \nthings without using \ntechnologies \n(80% v. 50%) \nI waste too much time \ngoing through irrelevant \ninformation on the \nInternet to get to what I \nam looking for \n(61% ex-users v. 33% \nusers) \n \nThe Internet is \nfrustrating to work \nwith \n(50% v. 42%) \n \n 5 \nThe typical statements by elderly Internet users compared to younger users \n \nBase: Internet user over 65 (N=124) compared to Internet user under 65 (N=1267) \n \nThe differences between younger and older Internet users in their attitudes towards ICTs are \nsmall. This illustrates that when older (or younger) people have had experience with the Internet \nthey are less likely to have negative perceptions of ICTs. \n \nConfidence in use  \nNotwithstanding similarities in attitudes towards ICTs in general, older users\u2019 Internet related \nconfidence levels are lower than those of younger users. \nThe Internet is an \nefficient means for \nfinding information \n(94% v. 94%) \nThe Internet \nmakes life easier \n(81% v 88%) \nI find things quickly \nwhen I look for them \non the Internet \n(33% v. 30%) \nThe Internet allows \nme to keep in touch \nwith people \n(96% v. 93%) \n 6 \nConfidence of younger and older Internet users \n23%\n19%\n16%\n30%\n18%\n28%\n19%\n27%\n20%\n46%\n6%\n10%\n11%\n12%\n14%\n14%\n14%\n15%\n16%\n27%\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\nHow would you rate your ability to use the\nInternet\nParticipating in a discussion online\nMaking new friends on the Internet\nDownloading and saving music (MP3)\nJudging the reliability of an on-line source\nLearning how to use a new technology\nFixing a problem by yourself when something\ngoes wrong\nUploading photos to a website\nCleaning a computer of viruses\nUsing the Internet to gather information\n % that rates skills Excellent \/ Very Confident\n65+ yrs\n<65 yrs\n \nBase: Internet user over 65 (N=124), Internet user under 65 (N=1267) \n \nThe differences in Internet self-confidence between younger and older users are largest for \ninformation seeking and situations that require online interacting.  \n \nProxy users \nFew older non-users indicated that lack of access was a reason to refrain from using the Internet. \nThis might be related to the existence of proxy-users. The elderly have traditionally depended on \nothers to help them out for a variety of activities that they do not feel comfortable or able to do \nthemselves. OxIS asked whether someone was available for support and if the person had asked \nsomeone to help them out:   \n\uf0b7 Two thirds of older non-users know someone they could ask  \n 7 \n\uf0b7 One fifth had asked someone for help  \n \nThis means that even when they know people who could help them out using ICTs, older non-\nusers rarely ask them. Even if they ask for help, the variety of people they depend on is rather \nlimited. People asked for help tend to be: \n\uf0b7 Children or grandchildren (85%) \n\uf0b7 Friends (16%) \n\uf0b7 A partner\/spouse (7%) \n \nThis shows that the ICT support network of older non-users is made up of close relatives or \nintimate others, very rarely do they know trained professionals or experts who can help them out.  \nFor those who use the Internet a different picture emerges, older Internet users asked:  \n\uf0b7 people at work or at school (15%) \n\uf0b7 took a course (11%) \n\uf0b7 paid someone to help them out (7%) \n\uf0b7 received help from family and friends (68%) \n\uf0b7 worked things out for themselves 70% \nNevertheless, older users have less strong support networks and cannot rely as much on learning \nby doing as younger users (around 80% had received help from family and friends and worked \nthings out for themselves). \n \nDigital Engagement \nIn comparison with younger Internet users, older users are more likely to be focussed on health \nand other practical services.  \n 8 \nActivities undertaken on the Internet by younger and older people  \n97%\n81%\n68%\n64%\n55%\n53% 51%\n37%\n28%\n21%\n97%\n64%\n69%\n23%\n49%\n13%\n43%\n8% 8%\n32%\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\nEm\nai\nl\neC\no\nm\nm\ner\nce\neH\nea\nlt\nh\nLi\nst\nen\nin\ng \nto\nm\nu\nsi\nc\nO\nn\nlin\ne\nb\nan\nki\nn\ng\nSo\nci\nal\nN\net\nw\no\nrk\nin\ng\nP\nay\nin\ng \nb\nill\ns\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\nin\ng\nvi\nd\neo\ns C\nh\nat\n \nIn\nve\nst\nm\nen\nts\n %\n t\nh\nat\n h\nas\n d\no\nn\ne \nin\n t\nh\ne \nla\nst\n 6\n m\no\nn\nth\ns\n< 65 65+\n Base: Internet user over 65 (N=124), Internet user under 65 (N=1267) \n \nYounger Internet users tend to undertake activities more frequently but their emphasis is on other \ntypes of engagement. For older people the so-called Web 2.0 (interactive) activities are \nuncommon while they are relatively popular amongst younger people. Nevertheless, the five most \npopular activities (emailing, checking facts, websurfing, making travel plans and looking for topic \nof personal interest) are the same for the younger and older internet users.  \n \nConclusions for the health and public service sector \nThe Oxford Internet Surveys and other studies have shown that amongst older people \ndisengagement from service providers on the internet is likely to be a combination of forced \nexclusion and choice.  It is not just a matter of providing access or skills training but also of \novercoming negative attitudes. Many older people indicate that they have chosen not to use a \ntechnology that is of no interest or not made for them and that they will leave it to others.  \nThus, before referring older people to information available online, a service provider should \nremember that this person is very unlikely to use the Internet but that they might have (non-\n 9 \nexpert) others who do this for them. Ask how these others can be informed or reached if the client \nneeds information that is only available online. Alternative resources need to be provided to \ncounter the disinterest, technological anxiety, lack of confidence and infrequent experience that \nmany older people have in relation to ICTs. If the person is well educated, healthy and socially \nactive, their experiences with the web are likely to be very similar to that of the younger person, \nperhaps slightly more practical and information oriented. In fact, the health and service sector is \none of the most accessed by older people who do use the Internet. However, most older people \ndo not use the Internet and are uncomfortable with interactive features, important facts to keep \nin mind when designing digital services. \n \nReferences and further information \nDutton, W.H., Helsper, E.J. & Gerber, M.M.
