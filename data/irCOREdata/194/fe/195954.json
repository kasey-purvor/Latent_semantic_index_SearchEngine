Immune complex \nformation in IgAN remains a poorly understood process, however Novak and \ncolleagues have over the past 5 years steadily unravelled some of the intricacies, in \nparticular the potential contribution of IgG anti-IgA1 autoantibodies to IgA-IC \nformation [2]. In contrast to other diseases associated with immune complex \nformation, immune complexes in IgAN appear to develop as a result of a shift in the \ndistribution of IgA1 O-glycoforms in the serum. In the present paper, Suzuki and \ncolleagues demonstrate IgA1 O-glycoform specific IgG antibodies in the serum of \nIgAN patients from both USA and Japan. They have gone on to generate B-cell lines \nfrom these patients and used the IgG secreted by these cell lines to characterise its \nspecificity. They show that IgG from cells derived from IgAN patients binds  poorly \ngalactosylated IgA1 O-glycoforms and in vitro triggers the formation of IgA1-IgG \nimmune complexes. They also present preliminary data suggesting that measurement \nof IgG with specificity for poorly galactosylated IgA1 may in the future form the \nbasis of a non-invasive diagnostic test for IgAN. \nReview of the field \nOne of the most striking findings in IgAN is an increase in the circulating levels of \npoorly galactosylated IgA1 O-glycoforms (Figure 1B). This has been observed in \npatient populations from North America, Europe and Asia using a variety of \ntechniques [3-5]. Importantly, two studies of IgA1 eluted from isolated glomeruli \nhave shown that mesangial IgA is enriched with poorly galactosylated IgA1 O-\nglycoforms, strongly implicating the composition of IgA1 hinge region glycans in the \nTranslational nephrology \n \nmechanism of IgA1 deposition [6, 7]. Novak and colleagues have also reported that \nthese poorly galactosylated IgA1 O-glycoforms are predominantly found in \ncirculating high molecular weight IgA-IC in IgAN [2].  \nIgA1 is one of the very few serum proteins to have O-linked sugars. The 18-amino \nacid hinge region of IgA1 can carry from zero to 6 O-glycan moieties, each of which \nis a relatively short and simple sugar chain (Figure 1A). An IgA1 monomer, \nconsisting of two  heavy chains therefore carries multiple closely adjacent O-linked \nsugars in the hinge region, providing a tight clustering of sialic acid (NeuNAc), \ngalactose (Gal) and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues, variations in which \nmay exert significant effects on the overall physicochemical properties of the IgA1 \nmolecule [1]. A variety of IgA1 O-glycoforms exist due to the heterogeneity at each \nof the O-glycosylation sites. \nWhile formation of IgA-IC in IgAN is poorly understood, Suzuki and colleagues \npresent new evidence that poorly galactosylated IgA1 O-glycoforms may act as \nautoantigens, potentially triggering the production of glycan-specific IgG \nautoantibodies (Figure 1). Data from Japan also suggests that poorly galactosylated \nIgA1 O-glycoforms are liable to self-aggregation and immune complex formation, \nalthough it is unclear whether this is through antigen-independent hinge region \nattraction or the presence of O-glycan-specific IgA1 autoantibodies [8]. Once formed \nthere is strong in vitro evidence that IgA-IC display a high affinity for the \nextracellular matrix components fibronectin and type IV collagen [9], preferentially \nbind and activate mesangial cells [10] and activate complement through the alternate \nand lectin binding pathways [11]. Together these in vitro data support a pathogenic \nrole for circulating IgA-IC in glomerular IgA deposition and mesangial cell activation \nin IgAN. This is supported by clinical studies which have shown that the distribution \nTranslational nephrology \n \nof IgA1 O-glycoforms in the serum correlates with the degree of glomerular injury at \nthe time of renal biopsy [12] \nDiscussion \nThe mechanism underlying this increase in poorly galactosylated IgA1 O-\nglycoforms in IgAN remains controversial; a fundamental abnormality of O-\nglycosylation machinery, with at least in part a genetic basis, has been hypothesised \nbut remains unproven [13]. However, it must be appreciated that even normal \nindividuals have some poorly galactosylated IgA1 O-glycoforms in their circulation \nas part of the immune response to mucosal antigens e.g. Helicobacter pylori and \nmucosal vaccines. In contrast, systemic antigen challenge is associated with the \npredominant production of IgA1 O-glycoforms with greater numbers of terminal \ngalactose residues [14, 15]. Why mucosal and systemic O-glycosylation of IgA1 \ndiffers so much remains unexplained. However, this raises the intriguing possibility \nthat in IgAN there is no defect in IgA O-glycosylation (i.e IgA1 is not \n\u201cundergalactosylated\u201d) but rather there is an increase in \u201cmucosal-type\u201d IgA1 in the \nserum. We and others reported some 15 years ago that IgAN is indeed associated with \na maldistribution of IgA1 secreting plasma cells from mucosal to systemic sites [16, \n17]. More recently, changes in the homing of lymphocytes between mucosal and \nsystemic sites has also been reported in IgAN [18, 19]. One possibility therefore is \nthat mucosal IgA1-committed plasma cells are misdirected to systemic sites in IgAN \nand then secrete \u201cmucosal-type\u201d IgA1 into the circulation - the \u201cright\u201d IgA1 \nmolecules ending up in the \u201cwrong\u201d place (Figure 2). \nImmune complex formation in IgAN may similarly be a case of the \u201cright\u201d IgG \nantibodies being in the \u201cwrong\u201d place at the \u201cwrong\u201d time. Suzuki and colleagues \npropose that the IgG anti-IgA1 autoantibodies could in fact be antibodies specific for \nTranslational nephrology \n \nbacterial and viral surface glycoproteins and that recognition of poorly galactosylated \nIgA1 O-glycoforms is an unfortunate coincidence, a phenomenon known as molecular \nmimicry [2](Figure 2). Such a hypothesis may partly explain the well described \nassociation of macroscopic haematuria with upper respiratory tract infections, often \nthought of as pathognomonic of IgAN.  During a normal response to infection serum \nlevels of microbial-specific IgG (and IgA) rise. In patients with IgAN it is possible \nthat a proportion of the glycan-specific anti-microbial antibodies bind in error to \npoorly galactosylated IgA1 O-glycoforms present in the serum at high levels, \nresulting in rapid IgA-IC formation. A sudden increase in IgA-IC levels may then lead \nto rapid glomerular IgA-IC deposition, mesangial cell activation and glomerular \nhaematuria. An increase in circulating IgA-IC levels during episodes of macroscopic \nhaematuria has been reported, however, any involvement of molecular mimicry in \nIgA-IC formation is at present pure speculation [10, 20]. \nWhile these new observations strongly support a role for IgG anti-IgA1 \nautoantibodies in IgAN there is a note of caution. IgG deposition is not universally \nseen in renal biopsies in IgAN, and in some series IgA1- IgG co-deposition is reported \nin only a minority of cases. The authors have argued (unpublished observations) that \nthis is due to the use of immunohistopathological techniques with low sensitivity. \nHowever, until we have unequivocal evidence for generalised co-deposition of IgA1-\nIgG it is difficult to truly judge the importance of IgG anti-IgA1 autoantibodies in \nIgAN and the potential clinical utility of measuring them in IgAN.    \nTake home message \nA previously unsuspected link between IgG specific for microbial glycoproteins and \nmucosal IgA inadvertently entering the circulation may underlie IgA immune \ncomplex formation in IgAN. \nTranslational nephrology \n \nReferences \n1.

The O-linked sugars of IgA1 are attached to serine or threonine residues in the \nIgA1 hinge region which lies between the CH1 and CH2 domains of the 1 heavy \nchain. The O-linked sugar chains are core 1 structures based on N-\nacetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) in O-linkage with serine (usually) or threonine. This \ncore GalNAc may be further extended with galactose (Gal) in the 1,3 configuration \nor sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid, NeuNAc) in an 2,6 configuration. GalNAc-\nGal may be further extended with sialic acid in 2,3-linkage with Gal. \n1B.
