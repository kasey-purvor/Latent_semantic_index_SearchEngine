INTRODUCTION \nMorck et al. (2000: 215) claim that \u201cstock prices move together more in poor \neconomies than in rich economies\u201d. Rich economies tend to have stronger property \nrights, better corporate governance regimes and more efficient enforcement \nmechanisms, all of which promote arbitrage trading based on information about a \nfirm\u201fs fundamentals. In the presence of such an information environment, they argue, \nprices will incorporate more firm-specific information and, therefore, co-move less \nwith the market.  \nThe study of the quality of information environments at the cross-country \nlevel is of major relevance to both the investing community and regulators. Barriers to \ninternational trade are vanishing and at the same time capital mobility has been \nincreasing and, therefore, investors need more country-specific information and a \nbetter understanding of international stock markets. At the same time, regulators are \nendeavouring to make strong efforts to harmonise both capital market regulations and \nfinancial reporting rules. The study of these matters helps us to understand the \ninformation dynamics, both within a country and at the cross-country level, and \ntherefore hopefully will facilitate the formulation of more informed regulation. \nMorck et al.\u201fs (2000) approach uses the average R\u00b2 for a country of a \nregression of a company\u201fs stock returns on overall stock market returns as a proxy for \nthe quality of a country\u201fs information environment. The appeal of this approach is that \nit seems to provide a simple measure to evaluate the complex concept of information \nquality. The R\u00b2 methodology has an intuitive logic behind it. In the extreme case \n 3 \nwhere firm-level information is so poor that investors cannot distinguish between \ncompanies, they will be forced to treat them as essentially the same. Market-wide \ninformation will then be the major factor driving price changes, with consequently \nhigh R\u00b2s being observed.\n1\n High R\n2\ns might also be observed in a market where firms \nare generally large and well-diversified. On the other hand, if firms are generally \nfocused in particular lines of business or where good sources of reliable firm-specific \ninformation are available then firms will not be viewed as substitutes by investors, and \nR\n2\ns should be small. This intuition underpins the use of R\u00b2 as a metric for ranking \ncountries according to the quality of their information environments.  \nMost subsequent research in this area takes for granted the reliability of R\n2\n as \na measure of information. This paper critically analyses such use of R\u00b2 at the cross-\ncountry level. We show that such an informational interpretation of R\u00b2 has to be \ntreated with great care. We apply the R\u00b2 methodology in a cross-country setting using \na very comprehensive data set we have collected based on forty countries over the \ntwenty-year period 1985-2004. Our results demonstrate clearly the inadequacy of the \nR\u00b2 as a measure of the quality of the information environment. When attempting to \nmeasure the quality of firm-specific information at the country-level, there are many \nconfounding factors to be accounted for,\n2\n raising severe doubts as to whether it is \npossible to encapsulate such a multiplicity of factors in a single measure. \n                                                 \n1\n In the limit, a pooling equilibrium would prevail, with attendant risks of a \u201emarket for lemons\u201f that \nmight cause a breakdown in the market (Akerlof, 1970). Very poor information environments are thus \nlikely to limit the growth of stock markets. In keeping with prior research in this area, we do not \nconsider such endogeneity issues any further in the present study. \n2\n For instance: size of the country, size of capital markets, type of economy, investor property rights, \ncorruption levels and the role of government in the economy. \n 4 \nOur approach can be summarized as follows. First, we rank countries \naccording to their average R\u00b2 for the whole period. We then consider whether the \nresulting ranking can be reconciled with what is generally known about the financial \nenvironments of the countries involved. Whilst the ranking presented by Morck et al. \n(2000) for the single year of 1995 is certainly plausible in terms of its association with \nparticular country economic and legal variables, our ranking based on the average for \nthe whole 20 years is very different and presents a puzzling picture. Furthermore, the \nannual R\u00b2 for a single country changes considerably from year to year, a fact which is \nhard to reconcile with the argument that corporate governance and investor protection \nregimes are driving its behaviour. Such a relationship would only be possible if these \nfactors change with rapidity and frequency, improving one year and falling back again \nin the next, circumstances which are highly unlikely.  \nTo explore the implausible behaviour of R\u00b2 further, we examine the spurious \neffects of aggregation and decomposition on the measure. We do this by artificially \naggregating and decomposing real countries to create pseudo-countries and analyse \ntheir impact on R\u00b2. When we create a bigger \u201ecountry\u201f by \u201emerging\u201f two smaller ones, \nwe find that the resultant R\u00b2 falls dramatically. We also explore the converse, by \nbreaking a single country, the USA, into smaller pseudo-countries defined by the \nparticular US stock market in which a firm is listed. We find that the R\u00b2 of each \npseudo-country is larger than that for the USA as a whole. By construction, these \neffects cannot be explained in terms of changes in the quality of the information \nenvironment or in the factors that Morck et al. (2000) claim to be driving R\u00b2, i.e. \ncorporate governance and investor protection regimes.  \nOur study adds to the small but growing body of empirical work that \nexamines the reliability of R\u00b2, also commonly referred to as stock return \n 5 \nsynchronicity, as a measure of stock price informativeness. Pantzalis and Xu (2008) \nshow that whilst large firms in the USA have greater price informativeness, \nsynchronicity reveals nothing further when size is taken into account. Other studies \nexamine the effects of noise on R\u00b2 and reach different conclusions. Teoh and Yang \n(2008) show that R\u00b2 is negatively correlated with noise and Shen (2008) finds that \nsynchronicity is more driven by information than noise. However, Hou, Peng and \nXiong (2006) find that stocks with low R\u00b2 could suffer from greater market \ninefficiency because they exhibit stronger long-run price reversals, a finding more \nconsistent with the noise interpretation. It is worth noting in this context that Evans \n(2009) finds that US stocks with lower R\u00b2s are traded more heavily by individual \ninvestors and Chan, Hameed and Kang (2007) report that synchronicity is positively \nassociated with liquidity. All these studies use US data; as such, they can provide only \nlimited insight into the use of R\u00b2 in an international setting. In contrast, Ashbaugh-\nSkaife, Gassen and LaFond (2006) regress, country by country, R\u00b2 on a battery of \ninformation measures, finding inconsistent relationships across countries between R\u00b2 \nand the information measures. Our work complements their study by assessing the \nplausibility of the behaviour of R\u00b2, both across countries and time.\n3\n Furthermore, we \nexamine the sensitivity of the measure to arbitrary re-definitions of what constitutes a \ncountry.  \nThe remainder of the paper is organised as follows: The next section reviews \nthe literature. Section 3 discusses our sample and the metrics used in the paper. \nSection 4 empirically explores the cross-country setting, by analysing in the different \n                                                 \n3\n Mention should also be made of the work of Karolyi, Lee and van Dijk (2009) which examines both \nsupply-side and demand-side explanations for how the commonalities in the co-movement of stock \nreturns, liquidity and turnover varies across countries and over time. \n 6 \nways described above, anomalies in the behaviour of R\u00b2 as a measure of information \nenvironment quality. Conclusions appear in the final section. \n2. PRIOR RESEARCH \nIn this section, we outline the rationale underlying the R\u00b2 methodology as a measure \nof information quality and explain how it has been used in empirical research. We \nthen establish a context for the present study by summarising the growing body of \nwork criticising the R\u00b2 methodology. \nMorck et al. (2000) argue that strong property regimes provide the economic \nconditions conducive to information-driven arbitrage trading based on firms\u201f \nfundamentals. As these conditions are generally found in developed countries and less \nso in developing ones, the stock prices of the former are likely to incorporate more \nfirm-specific information than are the latter. Their study uses a methodology first \nintroduced by Roll (1988) to test the ability of asset pricing theory to explain ex-post \nstock returns based on pervasive factors, industry influences and events unique to the \nfirm.  \nRoll (1988) uses a regression of company returns on market and industry \nreturns\n4\n and interprets the coefficient of determination (R\u00b2) of this regression as an \ninverse proxy for firm-specific information. High (low) R\u00b2s indicate that company \nreturns are being explained more (less) by pervasive factors compared to firm-specific \nfactors. To test if the unexplained component was the result of firm-specific \ninformation, Roll ran the regression again excluding observations on the dates on \n                                                 \n4\n Roll\u201fs (1988) initial model has only market returns as an explanatory variable. The industry factor is \nadded to improve the model\u201fs coefficient of determination and, therefore, results in a more refined \nmeasure of firm-specific information. Roll (1988) uses the one factor CAPM and the multi-factor APT \nmodel; both models produce similar results. \n 7 \nwhich information about the firm or its industry appeared in the public domain. If the \nresiduals were capturing firm-specific information, the R\u00b2 of the second regression \nshould be considerably higher. However, he found that deleting those dates did not \nincrease R\u00b2 significantly. Roll (1988: 566) concludes that an \u201coccasional frenzy \nunrelated to concrete information\u201d was driving the results. Despite subsequent \nattempts to improve the methodology (Brown, 1999; Cornell, 1990; Robin, 1993), his \nconclusion remains uncontested.  \nA new and developing stream of research uses the R\u00b2 methodology. Morck et \nal. (2000: 216, emphasis added) state that \u201c[a]s Roll (1988) makes clear, the extent to \nwhich stocks move together depends on the relative amounts of firm-level and market-\nlevel information capitalized into stock prices\u201d. A close reading of Roll\u201fs paper \nsuggests that this is a questionable interpretation of his findings. Nevertheless, Morck \net al. (2000) show that R\u00b2s are higher in countries with poorer economies that are \noften characterised by weaker corporate governance and investor protection \nmechanisms, as measured by a \u201egood government index\u201f based on La Porta et al. \n(1998).\n5\n In the presence of weak property rights, information-based trading becomes \nless attractive, less firm-specific information is capitalised and, therefore, more stock \nprice synchronicity is observed. \n                                                 \n5\n Morck et al.\u201fs (2000) research finds a significant and negative association between R\u00b2 and countries\u201f \nGDP. They hypothesise that GDP might be proxying for specific economic characteristics affecting \nstock price synchronicity. To test this hypothesis, the R\n2\n stock price synchronicity measure is regressed \non the following structural variables: the natural log of the number of shares traded in the market, the \ncountry\u201fs GDP and a vector of structural economic characteristic (macroeconomic volatility, country \nsize, economy diversification, and earnings co-movement). Inclusion of  these structural variables fails \nto mitigate the statistical significance of GDP. In contrast, the inclusion of the \u201egood government index\u201f \nrenders the GDP coefficient statistically insignificant. \n 8 \nSubsequent cross-country and firm-level research appears to corroborate \nthese results.\n6\n Jin and Myers (2006) find that countries where firms tend to be more \nopaque\n7\n have higher R\u00b2 and higher frequencies of crashes. Control rights and the \nopaqueness of information affect managerial behaviour and, therefore, higher R\u00b2s are \nassociated with countries having less developed capital markets and weaker corporate \ngovernance regimes.  \nThere is also a growing body of literature using the R\u00b2 measure at the firm-\nlevel (e.g. Durnev et al., 2001; Durnev et al., 2003; Fox et al., 2003; Piotroski and \nRoulstone, 2004). Most of this literature uses the R\u00b2-methodology as proposed by \nMorck et al. (2000) without questioning its reliability. More recently, the \ninformational interpretation of R\u00b2 has been subjected to detailed scrutiny at this level. \nAshbaugh-Skaife et al. (2006) confirm Morck et al.\u201fs (2000) findings for a smaller set \nof countries but strongly disagree with their interpretation of the results. They \ndocument the non-existence of a relationship between R\u00b2 and a set of firm-specific \nvariables, such as analyst forecast errors, firm size and stock turnover, which might be \nexpected to capture aspects of the quality of the firm\u201fs information environment. Their \nresults lead them to conclude that R\u00b2 is not associated with firm-specific information \nand, therefore, cannot be used to compare countries from an informational \n                                                 \n6\n These studies have applied the R\u00b2 methodology in a variety of settings and contexts. For example, it \nhas been used by Beuselinck, Joos, Khurana and Van der Meulen (2009), Ding, Hope, Jeanjean and \nStolowy (2006), Kim and Shi (2007) and Wang and Yu (2009) to examine the informativeness of \nchanges resulting from the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). It has been \nused by Li, Morck, Young and Yeung (2003), Durnev, Li, Morck and Yeung (2004), Khanaker and \nHeaney (2008), Chan and Hameed (2006), and Hsin and Liao (2003) to address various issues \nregarding the information and governance environments of stock markets in emerging markets. It is \nused by Ting (2008) to assess corporate disclosure policy and by Chung, Huang and Tseng (2007) \nregarding the impact of investor protection. In relation to the impact of cross listing, see Fernandes and \nFerreira (2008). \n7\n In their model, opaqueness refers to the lack of transparency between managers and investors.  \n 9 \nperspective. These results are reinforced by Kelly (2007), who arrives at similar \nconclusions, showing that the R\u00b2 is not related to firm-level fundamentals that theory \nand evidence suggest are predictive of the quality of a firm\u201fs information environment \n(e.g. firm size, age, institutional ownership, analyst coverage and liquidity).  \nLittle theoretical work has been carried out on the suitability of R\u00b2 as a \nmeasure of informativeness. Two exceptions are Jin and Myers (2006) and Dasgupta, \nGan and Gao (2009), both of which posit a simple cash flow generating process that \nincludes information shocks. Jin and Myers (2006) allow for lack of transparency \nbetween managers and investors in their model, thereby generating the prediction that \nopaque stocks with high R\u00b2s are more likely to deliver large negative returns.\n8\n This \nsetup provides a theoretical basis for the informational interpretation of R\u00b2. The model \nof Dasgupta et al. (2009) allows for firms with good information environments to have \nnews about future events already impounded in their stock prices, thereby resulting in \nlittle price reaction when those events finally take place. Such firms will display \ngreater synchronicity than firms where news about future events is revealed more \nslowly. This would lead to reliance on R\u00b2 yielding erroneous conclusions about the \nquality of the firms\u201f disclosure policies.  \nWhile most of the criticism has focused on the use of R\u00b2 at the firm level, the \nresults at the cross-country level have received less attention. Our study focuses on the \nplausibility of the behaviour of the R\u00b2 measure per se in a cross-country setting and \nthe sensitivity of the measure to how a \u201ecountry\u201f is defined. We impose on our \nresearch design no constraints of the kind developed in the above theoretical models.  \n                                                 \n8\n For an accounting application using the Jin-Myers approach, see Hutton, Marcus and Tehranian \n(2008). \n 10 \n3. METRICS AND SAMPLE CONSTRUCTION \nIn order to assess the validity of R\u00b2 as a measure of firm-specific information, we use \nregression to capture the level of stock returns explained by the market. We adopt the \nusual practice in cross-country studies using the R\u00b2 methodology of not including an \nindustry variable in the model because of the attendant difficulties in defining \nindustries in countries with small capital markets (the majority of the sample). Unlike \nMorck et al. (2000), we do not include US stock market returns as a variable because a \nfirm\u201fs exposure to the US market is better viewed as having two components, one \nbeing firm-specific and the other market-wide, the latter being captured by the market \nvariable and the former by the residuals.  \nOur model, expressed in Equation (1), regresses company j\u2019s returns (RCjwt) \non the market\u201fs returns (RMjwt) and yields an R\n2 \nvalue per company-year.  \njwtjwtjtjtjwt RMRC \uf065\uf062\uf061 \uf02b\uf02b\uf03d  (1) \nTo mitigate thin trading problems, all returns are measured on a weekly basis (w) for \neach year (t). To prevent spurious correlations \u2013 more severe in countries with few \ncompanies \u2013 market returns are value-weighted averages excluding company j, as \nfollows:  \n\uf0e5\n\uf0e5\uf0b9\uf03d\n\uf0b9\n\uf03d \uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0b4\uf03d\nn\nji\ni\niwtn\nji\ni\niwt\niwt\njwt RC\nMV\nMV\nRM\n1\n1\n (2) \nwhere RMjwt is the market return in week w of year t, excluding firm j, MViwt is \ncompany i\u2019s market value for the same period and n is the number of companies in the \nmarket. RCiwt is company i\u201fs returns in week w of year t.  \n 11 \nR\n2 \nis the proportion of the regression sum of squares (SSR) to the total sum of \nsquares (SST), which is in turn the sum of SSR and the sum of squared errors (SSE). \njtjt\njt\njt\njt\njt\nSSESSR\nSSR\nSST\nSSR\nR\n\uf02b\n\uf03d\uf03d2  (3) \nAn annual R\u00b2 value for the entire sample is then computed by weighting individual \nR\n2\ns within country c by SST, as in Equation (4) below. We adopt this approach for \npurposes of comparison with prior work and because it allows us to apply the same \nrationales as in Equation (3) at the country level and to facilitate the decomposition of \nthe aggregate R\u00b2 into its components: \n\uf028 \uf029\n\uf0e5\n\uf0e5\n\uf0ce\n\uf0ce\n\uf0b4\n\uf03d\ncj jt\ncj jt\njt\nct\nSST\nSSTR\nR\n2\n2\n (4) \nA large R\n2\n for a firm indicates that the market explains a substantial \nproportion of its returns. Under the informational interpretation used by Morck et al. \n(2000) and Durnev et al. (2001), a small R\n2\n means that such pervasive factors poorly \nexplain the company\u201fs returns and, therefore, firm-specific information is driving the \nmeasure. These rationales, when applied at the country-level, suggest that in countries \nwith high (low) R\u00b2s, market-wide factors are more (less) relevant in explaining stock \nreturns relative to firm-specific information.  \nTo aid comparability, our sample comprises data for the same forty countries \nused in Morck et al. (2000), but covering a much longer period, 1985-2004. These \ncountries form a comprehensive set of active capital markets that are representative of \ncapital markets worldwide.  \nFor each country, we select the most comprehensive list of companies \navailable in the database. We eliminate all duplicate records, both within and across \n 12 \ncountries (i.e., cross-listed companies). When deleting cross-country duplicates, we \nretain the observation from the country of origin. We exclude secondary issues of \nshares, companies where we cannot obtain all the required information, and \ncompanies that for a particular year have less than 26 weekly observations for returns. \nFinally, to mitigate the influence of extraneous environmental and governance factors, \nwe exclude companies classified as foreign for a particular market. Table 1 presents \ndetails of the composition of the final sample.  \nTable 2 shows the number of companies per year in each country. The \nnumber of firms varies significantly across countries. Poland has the least firms, with \nan average of only 27 companies, and the USA has the most, with an average of 6,624 \ncompanies. The overall average per country is 342 companies (181 if we exclude the \nUSA) and the median is 96 companies. There are missing data for earlier years for \nsome countries. We deal with this missing-data problem by running our tests both for \nthe whole period and for the period for which common data are available for all \ncountries (1997-2004). We delete years when the number of firms in a country is \nbelow 20% of its average for the whole period.\n9\n All information was retrieved directly \nfrom CRSP for the US firms and from  Datastream for all other countries. Our sample  \nincludes dead firms and financial companies.  \nA final difference between our sample and Morck et al.\u201fs (2000) is that we do \nnot exclude extreme returns. In their study, all bi-weekly stock returns higher than \n25% in absolute value are excluded as data errors. Prior detailed investigations on our \nUK sample, untabulated here, suggest that such extreme retunrs are much more likely \n                                                 \n9\n As a robustness check, we also replicate this sample selection criterion at 10% and 25%. Our results \nare not statistically sensitive to the choice of cutoff point. \n 13 \nto reflect important new information and as such are not simply due to measurement \nerror.\n10\n Our reason for not excluding such extreme observations is to ensure all \ninformation effects are properly captured.  \nTable 3 compares results for the year of 1995 used in Morck et al.\u201fs study to \ncheck consistency between our results and their\u201fs. It shows, as expected, R\u00b2s in our \nsample are considerably lower than Morck et al.\u201fs. We rank the two sets of results and \nrun two nonparametric measures of association (Sheskin, 2004). Both Kendall\u201fs tau \nand Spearman\u201fs rho show a high degree of concordance, 0.75 and 0.83, respectively, \nboth significant at the 0.01 level, allowing us to conclude that there is a monotonic \npositive relation between the ranks in our study and that of Morck et al.\u201fs (2000). As a \nfurther sensitivity check, we also re-ran all the analyses reported below, using a model \nidentical to Morck et al.\u201fs that included US returns with exactly the same trimming of \nextreme returns at 25%. Untabulated results indicate that our overall results reported \nlater in this paper remain substantially unaffected.  \n4. RESULTS \n(i) Ranking Countries  \nWe rank countries by their mean R\u00b2 over the sample period to see if such rankings \naccord with commonly-held preconceptions of the quality of countries\u201f information \nenvironments. In Table 4 Panel A, we can immediately determine that the rank \nproduced based on the mean (last column) is inconsistent with an informational \n                                                 \n10\n In particular, we examined actual information releases for our complete sample of UK companies \nduring the weeks in which the extreme returns were observed. We used the Perfect Information \ndatabase and selected all returns above 200%. In 87% of the cases there was an information release \nabout the company. \n 14 \nexplanation. The Czech Republic and Portugal are in the top five and as such almost \nas good as the USA. Peru would be interpreted as having better corporate governance \nand investors\u201f protection regimes than the UK, with Pakistan as being near equal to \nJapan, and both far better than Hong Kong. Table 4 Panel B ranks countries by \nindividual year. The rankings exhibit considerable variability across time. \nAs a robustness test, Table 5 ranks the countries according to the R\u00b2 average \nfor the common data period (1997-2004) rather than the whole period. Conclusions \nare even more puzzling for this sub-sample. Now the USA, generally acclaimed as the \nstrongest capital market in the world, is only in eleventh place, behind countries like \nAustria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Ireland, Peru and Portugal.  \nClearly, whichever data set is used, the cross-country ranking of R\n2\n is \nextremely sensitive to the choice of year. Furthermore, one can observe from Table 4 \nPanel B that for some countries R\u00b2 is erratic over time.\n11\n If corporate governance and \nother macro-economic factors are deemed mainly to explain the behaviour of the R\u00b2 \nmeasure, then we would not expect to observe such extreme fluctuations as the ones \nshown. There are 696 adjacent-year-country possible paired combinations. In 171 \npairings we observe either an increase of at least 100% or decrease of more than 50% \nin annual R\u00b2. The number goes up to 324 pairings if we consider increases of at least \n50% and decreases of 33% or more in R\u00b2.  \nTo test if the overall differences in R\u00b2 from year to year are statistically \nsignificant, we apply a Single-Factor Within-Subjects Analysis of Variance based on \n                                                 \n11\n As stated earlier, as a check we have also carried out this analysis using the same procedures \nfollowed in Morck et al. (2000). Untabulated results indicate similar sensitivity to the choice of year \nand similar erratic behaviour. \n 15 \nthe null hypothesis that the mean R\u00b2 between years in the sample is constant.\n12\n \nUntabulated results show that, after removing the country effect, the null hypothesis is \nrejected at both the 0.05 and 0.01 levels, confirming that that there is a significant \ndifference between the mean R\u00b2 for at least two of the years. These results hold both \nfor the whole sample and for the common sample. \n13\n  \nWe also examine whether there are significant changes between overall \naverage R\u00b2 for adjacent years. Untabulated results reveal that for 14 (10) out of the 19 \nyear pairs the null hypothesis that overall average R\u00b2s remain stable is rejected at the \n0.05 (0.01) level. Again, applying the same test to the common data years results in \nthe rejection of the null hypothesis for 5 (4) out of the 7 year pairs at the 0.05 (0.01) \nlevel, respectively.  \n(ii) Effects of Aggregation and Decomposition  \nIf R\u00b2 is to serve as a reliable measure of the information environment it should not be \naffected unduly by the arbitrary aggregation of or subdivision of countries when \nselecting a measure of market returns. We address this issue by presenting the results \nof creating R\n2 for \u201epseudo-countries\u201f obtained by aggregating real countries based on \ndifferent criteria described below and comparing them with the average of the R\n2 \nfor \nthe original non-aggregated countries. We then explore the inverse approach by \ndecomposing the American market into its three main stock exchanges.  \n                                                 \n12\n This test is a multivariate analogue of the paired sample t test for means and it increases the power of \nthe test by examining the extent of the differences in mean annual R\u00b2 for years (between \u201econditions\u201f) \nafter removing the effect of the countries (between \u201esubjects\u201f). \n13\n We also apply the non-parametric Friedman Two-Way Analysis of Variance by Ranks test (Sheskin, \n2004) to the country ranks shown in Table 4 Panel B in order to test if at least two medians are \ndifferent, with essentially the same results. \n 16 \nEquation (5) represents the baseline we use to compute the R\u00b2 for a single \ncountry. In this equation, the returns of firm i in country j (Rij) are regressed on the \nmarket returns of country j, and then weighted by SST for the combined countries \ntogether to get the R\n2 \nfor the whole pseudo-country:  \nijjjjij RMR \uf065\uf062\uf061 \uf02b\uf02b\uf03d . (5) \nThe same equation is used to compute the R\u00b2 for a given pseudo-country. In this case, \nthe pseudo-market return, RM, is generated using all companies in the n original \ncountry markets included in the pseudo-country. Fitting one model for n combined \ncountries would result in a single composite index analogous to a value-weighted \naverage of the individual countries, as shown in Equation (6): \n\uf028 \uf029\uf05b \uf05d innnni RMwwRMwRMwR \uf065\uf062\uf061 \uf02b\uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf03d \uf02d\uf02d\uf02d 111111 ...1... . (6) \nIn concept, fitting separate models for each country could be viewed as analogous to \n(but not quite the same as) fitting a single regression model with dummy intercepts \nand slopes for each country, as in Equation (7):  \ninnnnni DRMDRMRMDDR \uf065\uf062\uf062\uf062\uf061\uf061\uf061 \uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf03d \uf02d\uf02d 1122111121 ...... . (7) \nTo the extent that the dummy variables are significant, and the explanatory power of \nthe markets is differentiated, this model would result in a better fit. On the other hand, \nonly if all the dummy variables were insignificant and the different markets had no \ndifferential explanatory power, would the resulting R\u00b2 be similar to the one yielded by \nEquations (5) and (6).\n14\n \n                                                 \n14 \nFitting a separate model for each country assumes country effects are independent of each other. It \ncould be the case, for example, that returns in one country may be affected by the index in another, \nresulting in the following equation. \n(Continues next page) \n 17 \n(a) Examples of the Effects of Aggregation \nBased on our data set, we provide some numerical examples to illustrate the effects of \naggregation of countries on R\n2\n discussed above. First, Table 6 Panel A illustrates the \neffects of combining pairs of geographically neighbouring countries to form a larger \npseudo-country. Morck et al.\u201fs analysis would not lead us to expect a significant \nchange in R\n2 \nas a result of this merger because the information environments remain \nconstant. Therefore, if R\u00b2 is a good measure of such a quality, we would expect R\u00b2s \npre- and post-merging to be an average of the two. However, when we perform such a \nprocedure based on our data, we consistently observe a drop in R\u00b2. Consider for \ninstance Belgium and Netherlands with R\u00b2s of 10% and 9%, respectively. The \nmerging of these two capital markets decreases R\u00b2 by 53% to 5%. If we follow Morck \net al.\u201fs (2000) interpretation, the merging of the two countries would be interpreted as \na significant increase in the strength of corporate governance and investor protection \nregimes and, therefore, in the overall quality of the information environment. For \nillustrative purposes, we applied the same procedure to other geographically \nneighbouring countries with similar results: China and Taiwan would apparently \n\u201eincrease\u201f the quality of their information environment by 36%, Malaysia and \nSingapore would observe an \u201eimprovement\u201f of 24% and, finally, Australia and New \nZealand of 34%, for example. \nSecond, the same effect is observed if we combine countries instead of by \ngeographical proximity, by similarity in R\n2\n, details of which are given in Table 6 \nPanel B. Pseudo-country E, for example, includes six countries (Ireland, New \n                                                                                                                                            \ninnnni RMRMDDR \uf065\uf062\uf062\uf061\uf061\uf061 \uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf03d \uf02d ...... 111121 . \nThis aspect is not considered in this paper. \n 18 \nZealand, Peru, United Kingdom, Brazil, and Australia), all with an R\u00b2s between 0.06 \nand 0.07; by merging them we observe a 40% reduction in R\u00b2. Other combinations \nselected by similarity in R\n2\n show even larger reductions in merged R\n2\n. Pseudo-country \nF (Germany, India, South Africa, Finland, Indonesia and Sweden), for example, which \nalso has a variation in R\n2\n between the original constituent countries of only 0.01, has a \n74% reduction in R\u00b2. \nFinally, we also examine the behaviour of R\n2\n where pseudo-countries are \ncreated by merging actual countries based on an external and non-R\n2\n-based selection \ncriterion. In particular we combine countries based on similarity of S&P transparency \nand disclosure rating scores (Doidge et al., 2004). The results, reported in Table 6 \nPanel C, show similarly declining merged R\n2 \nscores. This final basis for constructing \npseudo-countries could be regarded as particularly compelling, given that it provides \nus with an externally determined measure of some common dimensions of each \ncountry\u201fs corporate governance quality. Again, the aggregation of these information-\nenvironmentally similar countries has resulted in approximately a 50% reduction in \nR\u00b2. \nThe above examples demonstrate that aggregation does indeed reduce R\u00b2. \nThe reason is that instead of fitting n models, one per country, to determine R\u00b2 we are \nnow fitting only one model to n countries. We are effectively forcing the parameters \nto be the same across the n populations, as outlined and discussed analytically in the \nprevious section. If the parameters in the separate models are significantly different, \nthe aggregated model loses part of its ability to fit the data and a lower R\u00b2 results. In \n 19 \nall the above examples, untabulated Wald tests reveal that these parameter restrictions \nare highly significant.\n15\n \n(b) An Example of the Effects of Disaggregation \nWe now do the opposite by disaggregating one country, the USA, into three pseudo-\ncountries, each corresponding to one of its three major stock exchanges (AMEX, \nNASDAQ and NYSE). We know in advance, of course, that each pseudo-(subdivided) \ncountry has almost the same institutional framework. Needless to say, we might still \nexpect some differences. A large portion of the companies listed in the AMEX are \nsmaller than those in the other two stock exchanges. The NASDAQ is the largest \nstock exchange in terms of number of companies listed and number of shares traded \nper day. It has a strong focus on new technology and R&D intensive firms. The NYSE \nis by far the largest in dollar traded volume and second largest by number of \ncompanies listed. The NYSE is often considered as representing the Old Economy and \nthe NASDAQ as representing the New Economy. Table 7 Panel A presents the number \nof companies per year and per stock exchange.\n16\n  \nIn spite of these differences, all are under the regulatory umbrella of the SEC \nand apply the same accounting rules. All have a similar analyst environment and \ncorporate governance and investors\u201f protection regimes. However, if we look at Table \n7 Panel B without prior knowledge of the name of the particular stock exchange (as if \nthe R\u00b2s were from different countries), we would conclude that the country called \nNYSE has the worst information environment of the three pseudo-countries because it \n                                                 \n15\n Significance levels are high. 70% are significant at the 1% level. \n16\n Bennett and Sias (2006) attribute the increase in firm-specific risk over the last three decades to the \ngrowth of riskier industries, the increase of small stocks in the market and a decline in industry \nconcentration. Firms with these attributes are much more frequently found in AMEX or NASDAQ. \n 20 \nhas the highest R\n2\n. The other two \u201ecountries\u201f have somewhat similar R2s. It could be \nargued that we ought to observe the opposite ranking: the NASDAQ and AMEX \npseudo-countries comprise smaller and more technology-intensive companies. Smaller \ncompanies will be less closely followed by analysts and might have less sophisticated \ngovernance regimes. The value of technology-intensive companies will be subject to \ngreater uncertainty because they are more dependent on growth options. For both \ntypes of company, these factors might lead one to conclude that they have worse \ninformation environments and, as such, their pseudo-countries ought to have higher \nR\n2\ns. In passing, one might also note the similarity in R\n2\n of the NYSE with the South \nAmerican country, Colombia (see Table 3 Panel A). It is difficult to believe that the \ninformation environments of the NYSE and the Bogota Stock Exchange are of similar \nquality.  \n5. CONCLUSIONS \nThe paper presents a cross-country analysis of the use of R\u00b2 as a measure of \ninformation. Our results lead us to conclude that R\n2\n is inadequate as a measure of the \nquality of the information environment at a country level. The rationales advanced in \nthe literature for the use of country R\u00b2 as a measure of information have been based on \nthe implicit assumption of stability of country corporate governance and investor \nprotection regimes. It is inconceivable that such factors could change as rapidly and \nunpredictably as do the changes in country R\n2\n. Our study also reveals substantial \naggregation and disaggregation problems with interpreting R\n2 \nas a measure of the \nquality of the information environment at a country level.  \n 21 \nThe usefulness of a single indicator of the quality of a firm\u201fs information \nenvironment across countries is beyond question. However, our research indicates that \nR\n2 \nis an unreliable metric for this purpose.  \n 22 \nTable 1 \u2013Number of companies per country (1985-2004) \nCountry Datastream \nor CRSP list \n(no
