The paper's empirical analysis suggests that the duration \nstructure of unemployment, measured by the rate of inflows into unemployment relative to \nthe beginning of period stock, is the primary determinant of the competitiveness of a region's \nunemployed job-seekers. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJEL categories:  J64, R23 \n 3 \n 1. Introduction \n \n Following the work of Burgess (1993), a number of recent studies have emphasised \nthe role of competition between unemployed and employed job-seekers in determining the \nrate of outflows from unemployment.1 The basic tenet of these studies is that the share of new \nhires captured by the unemployed may be expected to vary over time and space depending on \nthe level of job search activity amongst those already in employment and the degree to which \nthe unemployed are effective competitors in the market for jobs. In this paper, we seek to \napply this framework to the analysis of unemployment flows in the regions of Great Britain. \nWe examine the extent to which variations in the 'competitiveness' of unemployed job-\nseekers, as opposed to variations in the rate of new hires, contribute to an explanation of \nregional variations in the rate of outflows from unemployment over the period from 1983 to \n1994. There have been many previous studies of regional unemployment in the UK (for \nrecent examples, see Evans and McCormick, 1994, Martin, 1997, and Taylor and Bradley, \n1997) but these have tended to concentrate on the analysis of unemployment  stocks. By \nfocusing instead on the outflows from unemployment, the present paper aims to bring a \nrelatively fresh perspective to bear on the analysis of regional disparities in unemployment.2  \n In common with Burgess's work using aggregate data, we find that variations in the \nrate of new hires - which we proxy using data on vacancy flows - play only a relatively minor \nrole in accounting for variations in the rate of outflow from unemployment across the British \nregions. Far more important are regional variations in the proportion of new hires captured by \nthe unemployed. We examine a variety of possible causes of these variations and find that the \n                                                          \n1Empirical studies include papers by van Ours (1995), Baker et al. (1996), Broersma \n(1997), Dor et al. (1997) and Mumford and Smith (1999). For a theoretical analysis of the \nimplications for unemployment transitions of the existence of on-the-job search, see \nPissarides (1994). \n2Martin and Sunley (1997) examine the extent to which variations in the pattern of \nflows into and out of unemployment account for the disparities in British regional \nunemployment rates, but do not attempt to explain the regional variation in unemployment \nflows. Studies of the determinants of spatial variations in outflows from unemployment at the \nsub-regional level have been carried out by Bennet and Pinto (1994), Coles and Smith (1996) \nand Burgess and Profit (1998), whilst Armstrong and Taylor (1985) present an analysis of \nspatial variations in the rate of inflows into unemployment in the North West of England. van \nOurs (1995) uses regional level data to study the determinants of outflows from \nunemployment in the Netherlands. \n 4 \nmost significant influence is the duration structure of regional unemployment. Specifically, \nwe find that the rate of outflows from unemployment is highest in regions where there is a \nhigh rate of inflows into unemployment relative to the beginning of period stock, so that a \nrelatively high proportion of the unemployed have relatively low durations of unemployment. \nA high rate of in-migration to the region relative to the civilian workforce is also found to \nhave a beneficial effect on the rate of outflows from unemployment at a given rate of new \nhires. On the policy front, we find relatively little evidence that the Restart programme has \nled to significant regional variations in unemployment flows. \n The pattern of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we present a picture of recent \ndevelopments in the rate of outflows from unemployment at the regional level and provide a \npreliminary indication of the extent to which these developments may alternatively be \nattributed to variations in the rate of new hiring or to variations in the share of new hires in \neach region which is captured by the unemployed. This Section also sets out the analytical \nframework within which we try to explain the observed pattern of regional variations in \noutflows from unemployment. In Section 3 we present the results of an econometric \ninvestigation into the causes of these regional variations in outflow rates based on pooled \ncross-section - time-series data for the ten regions of Great Britain for the years 1984-94. In \nSection 4, we use the results of this analysis to try to provide a breakdown of the causes of \ninter-regional variations in the average rate of outflows from unemployment over this eleven \nyear period. Finally, in Section 5 we offer some concluding remarks. \n  \n 5 \n2.  Regional Variations in Hiring and the Share of New Hires Captured by the \nUnemployed  \n \n Figure 1 provides a perspective on the issues which we seek to investigate. It shows, \nfor each of the standard regions of Great Britain, the rate of outflows from unemployment, x, \nand the rate of new hires, h (both expressed as a percentage of the labour force), over the \nperiod 1984-94, together with their ratio.3  The rate of new hires in each region is proxied \nusing data on outflows of vacancies previously notified to job-centres, adjusted to allow for \nthe fact that only a fraction of total vacancies are notified to job-centres.4 \n It is immediately apparent from the graphs that - as found in Burgess's study of \naggregate data - the rate of outflows from unemployment is only loosely related to the rate of \nnew hires and that there are significant regional and temporal variations in the ratio of \nunemployment outflows to vacancy outflows. The pattern of temporal variations is clearly \ncounter-cyclical in all regions. In terms of general trends across the sample period, however, \nthere are three fairly distinct regional groups. In the South East, East Anglia and the South \nWest, there is a discernible upward trend in (x\/h) over the period; in East and West Midlands \nno trend is apparent; whilst in the remaining regions - and most notably in Wales and \nScotland - the trend is reversed. Across regions, the ratio (x\/h) tends to be highest in \nYorkshire and Humberside and the North, and lowest in the South East and the North West.  \n One might reasonably expect the variations in (x\/h) to be closely related to variations \nin the proportion of unemployed job-seekers in the workforce (u). However, using regional \naverage data for the period as a whole, Figure 2 shows that although there is indeed a positive \nrelationship between these two series, it is not overwhelming and there are clearly other \nfactors at work which influence regional differences in the share of new engagements \ncaptured by the unemployed. \n To investigate more precisely the role of the rate of new hires in leading to variations \nin regional rates of outflows from unemployment, and the factors which influence the share of \n                                                          \n3This is essentially a reproduction, at the regional level, of the diagrammatic analysis \npresented by Burgess using aggregate data. See figure 2 on p.1192 of Burgess (1993). \n4The vacancy outflow figures for each region are multiplied by the ratio of an estimate \nof aggregate engagements based on Inland Revenue P45 data to the aggregate level of \nvacancy ouflows. I am grateful to Stephen Nickell for supplying me with the P45 data. \n 6 \nthe unemployed in new engagements, we use a variant of the framework employed by \nBurgess (1993) and more recently by Broersma (1997), i.e. we hypothesise that the rate of \noutflows from unemployment in region i in time period t is given by:  \n xit = \u03bbit uit\u03b8it\u03c1it                 (1) \n \nwhere \u03b8 denotes the arrival rate of job offers, \u03c1 the offer acceptance rate,  and  \u03bb measures the \nrelative success of the unemployed in attracting job offers. x and u are as previously defined. \n The derivation of equation (1) is based on the notion that the chance that an \nunemployed job-seeker obtains a job is \u03bb times that of an average job-seeker. So if Hu \ndenotes the number of hires from unemployment during a particular period (dropping the \nregion and time subscript for convenience) and H is the total number of hires, we have  \n Hu \/ U = \u03bb H \/ J        (2) \nwhere U is the number of unemployed and J denotes the total number of job-seekers, with \nH \/J = \u03b8\u03c1.  Multiplying both sides of (2) by u = U\/L where L is the labour force, and ignoring \noutflows associated with exits from the labour market, leads to equation (1). \n The contribution of the job competition approach is to note not only that the \nunemployed will be competing for jobs with job-seekers who are already in employment but \nalso that the number of employed job-seekers will tend to vary with the state of the labour \nmarket. In particular, Burgess (1993) notes that the proportion of employed workers engaging \nin on-the-job search will tend to be an increasing function of the job offer arrival rate, as a \nhigher arrival rate of job offers raises the prospective returns to on-the-job search. An \nimplication of this is that, other things equal, the elasticity of the unemployment outflow rate \nwith respect to an increase in the rate of new hires will tend to be less than one. Likewise, a \nrise in the unemployment rate will tend to produce a less than proportionate decrease in the \njob offer arrival rate \u03b8 as higher unemployment will tend to reduce the number of individuals \nengaging in on-the-job search.  \n At the regional level, we need to amend the basic framework above to allow for the \npossibility that a portion of new hires may be taken by workers from outside the region, \nwhilst a number of job-seekers within the region may be tempted to migrate to seek or take up \n 7 \nemployment elsewhere. We therefore specify the number of persons seeking jobs in region i \nas (again without the time subscripts):5 \n  Ji = \u03c4iU Ui + \u03c4iN \u03c6i(\u03b8i , Z)Ni + \u03d5iJ-i      (3) \nwhere Ui denotes the number of unemployed workers in  region i, Ni is the number in \nemployment, and J\n-i denotes the number of job-seekers presently located outside the region. \n\u03c4U and \u03c4N respectively denote the proportions of the region's unemployed and employed job-\nseekers (\u03c6iNi) who are seeking work inside rather than outside the region, whilst Z denotes a \nvector of variables which influence the propensity of employed workers to engage in job \nsearch at a given value of \u03b8. \n Equation (3) further indicates why at the regional level an increase in the rate of hiring \nmay be expected to lead to a less than proportionate increase in the outflow rate from \nunemployment. Not only will the increase in hiring tend to lead to an increase in the \nproportion of employed workers in the region engaging in job search, but it may also be \nexpected both to raise the rate of in-migration from job-seekers outside the region (i.e. by \nincreasing the value of  \u03d5i) and reduce the incentive for employed job-seekers within the \nregion to migrate to take up employment elsewhere (hence, raising \u03c4iN).6  More generally, the \nequation suggests that we should expect the arrival rate of job offers for job-seekers in region \ni to be negatively related to the regional rate of in-migration and positively related to the rate \nof out-migration.7  \n The vector Z is comprised of essentially two elements. Firstly, we follow Burgess and \nhypothesise that the number of employed workers in the region engaging in job search will be \na decreasing function of the unemployment benefit replacement rate. The explanation for this \nis that a high rate of unemployment benefit relative to earnings will tend to reduce the \n                                                          \n5We ignore the existence of job-seekers who may be resident in the region but who are \ncurrently outside the workforce. \n6For an analysis of the role of differential hiring rates, and other factors, in leading to \nregional migration flows, see Jackman and Savouri (1992). \n7There are two points to note here. Firstly, as there is no particular reason to suppose \nthat in and out migration will impact equally on the number of regional job-seekers we do not \nimpose the restriction that the job offer arrival rate will be dependent only on the regional rate \nof net migration. Secondly, in estimation we will need to allow for the possibility that the \nregional rates of in and out migration may themselves be dependent on the rate of outflows \nfrom unemployment. \n 8 \ndisutility associated with a spell of unemployment so that any employees faced with the \nprospect of losing their job may be less motivated to engage in on-the-job search prior to \nbeing made redundant. As benefit scales are fixed at the national level, we would expect such \nan effect, if relevant, to manifest itself in the form of a negative relationship between  \u03b8it and \nthe level of regional average earnings.  \n Secondly, we allow for the possibility that the incentives for employed individuals to \nengage in on-the-job search may be influenced by developments in the national economy (for \nexample, an increase in benefit scales or an increase in the aggregate rate of new hires) as \nwell as region-specific factors. In order to capture the influence of these macroeconomic \nfactors, which we assume to impact equally on all regions, we include a set of time dummies \nin the specification of Z. \n The term \u03bbit in equation (1) measures the relative success of the unemployed in \nattracting job offers. We expect this to be a function of the age, duration and spatial structure \nof the regional unemployment stock, plus a variety of other factors which we consider in \ndetail below. Concerning the age structure of unemployment, we hypothesise specifically that  \n\u03bb will be an increasing function of the proportion of young workers (i.e. those aged under 25) \nin the regional unemployment stock, and a decreasing function of the proportion of older \nworkers (those aged 55 or over, or from 1989, 50 or over). The supporting arguments here are \nwell known: young unemployed workers may be expected to be relatively active searchers in \nthe job market and relatively effective in competition with employed job-seekers, whilst for \nolder workers the reverse is likely to be true. \n In common with Burgess (1993) and Broersma (1997), we hypothesise that the share \nof new hires taken by the unemployed will be smaller the higher the proportion of long-term \nunemployed in the unemployment stock. This may either be because the experience of \nunemployment itself reduces a person's chance of obtaining a job - because they become \ndiscouraged from engaging in job search, become progressively de-skilled, or because they \nbecome stigmatised by employers - or because those entering long-term unemployment are \nmore likely to be relatively ineffective competitors in the job market.8 In the empirical \n                                                          \n8For attempts to discriminate between these 'state dependence' and 'worker \nheterogeneity' explanations for the relationship between the proportion of long-term \n 9 \nanalysis below, we attempt to capture the effect of the duration structure of unemployment in \ntwo ways: first, by including in the list of explanatory variables the proportion of the \nbeginning of period unemployment stock who have been unemployed for at least one year, \nand second, by including the ratio of current inflows into unemployment to the beginning of \nperiod stock. The latter is expected to be positively related to the outflow rate. \n Following the work of Coles (1994) and Coles and Smith (1995), Gregg and \nPetrongolo (1997) suggest a second reason why the proportion of new hires captured by the \nunemployed may be positively related to the ratio of unemployment inflows to the beginning \nof period stock. They suggest that new entrants to unemployment may be able to select from a \nbigger pool of job vacancies than their counterparts with longer durations. New entrants may \npotentially be able to match with a newly notified vacancy or with a vacancy from the \nexisting stock. The latter, however, are assumed to have already been sampled and rejected by \nthe existing unemployed, who are therefore able to match only with the flow of newly \nnotified vacancies. Consistent with this proposition, Gregg and Petrongolo show, using \naggregate data for the UK, that variations in the level of inflows into unemployment in a \ngiven period appear to have a much stronger effect on the level of outflows than do variations \nin the beginning of period unemployment stock.9 \n With regard to the spatial structure of unemployment, our hypothesis is that the share \nof new hires won by the unemployed in a region will be negatively related to the variance of \nunemployment rates between the constituent counties of the region concerned. Two \narguments may be made in support of this. Firstly, if the unemployed are unevenly distributed \nwithin a region they may be less likely, other things being equal, to come into contact with a \njob vacancy. Secondly, if unemployment is concentrated in particular local labour markets, \nthe social pressure on the unemployed in those areas to engage in active job search may be \nrelatively weak. \nRestart \n                                                                                                                                                                                    \nunemployed and outflows from unemployment, in the context of aggregate time-series data, \nsee Jackman and Layard (1991) and van den Berg and van Ours (1994). \n9The issue of competition between unemployed and employed job-seekers is ignored \nin Gregg and Petrongolo's empirical analysis. \n 10 \n In addition to the above, we investigate the impact of three further potential influences \non the relative success of unemployed job-seekers in the market for new hires. The first of \nthese is the Restart programme. This scheme, introduced in 1986 and initially targeted at \nthose with unemployment durations of six months or more, aims to assist the unemployed in \nthe process of finding a job or a place on a training programme. During the initial years of its \noperation, the scheme consisted of a sequence of interviews between the unemployed \nindividual and a Restart counsellor, during which the latter would assess the individual's \navailability for work, offer advice on benefit entitlement, job search behaviour and the \navailability of training programmes, and possibly even initiate direct contact with employers \n(Dolton and O'Neill, 1996). Failure to attend an appointment for a Restart interview could \nresult in disqualification from receipt of unemployment benefit, and the interview process \nitself could result in the reduction or suspension of a person's benefit payments if they were \ndeemed not to be making genuine efforts to find work. In more recent years, the spread of the \nscheme has broadened so that whilst the basic outline and objectives remain the same, the \n'Restart process' essentially has become one of  more or less continual appraisal of a person's \njob search activities and eligibility for benefit.   \n Previous studies have investigated the effects of the Restart scheme on individual \nunemployment durations (Dolton and O'Neill, 1996) and reservation wages (Dolton and \nO'Neill, 1995), as well as the scheme's effect on duration-specific outflow rates from \nunemployment (Lehmann, 1993). Here, we offer a slightly different perspective on the \nscheme's effects by studying its impact on the outflow rate from unemployment at a given rate \nof new hires. In this sense, we may be able to obtain a more direct assessment of the scheme's \neffectiveness in raising the competitiveness of unemployed job-seekers. \nMigration \n The second potential influence on \u03bbit which we investigate is the rate of regional \nmigration. This has already been discussed as a potential determinant of \u03b8, the job offer \narrival rate, where it was suggested that a high rate of regional in-migration may be associated \nwith a reduction in the probability that an individual job-seeker within the region will  receive \na job offer, whilst a high rate of out-migration might serve to raise it. For many migrants, the \n 11 \nmigration decision will be consequent on the acceptance of a job offer. However, for some - \nmost likely unemployed - job-seekers the decision to migrate may be part of, rather than the \noutcome of, the job search process. They may be motivated to move into a particular region in \nthe belief that their closer physical proximity may make them more likely to come into \ncontact with a job vacancy within the region than if they had remained outside. To the extent \nthat these workers are likely to be relatively active searchers in the job market, we might \ntherefore expect a high rate of regional in-migration to be associated with a relatively high \nvalue of \u03bb. Conversely, a high rate of out-migration, which removed the more active job-\nseekers from the regional unemployment stock would tend to reduce it.10 \nNew Firms, \"Good\" Jobs and \"Bad\" Jobs \n The final variable which we investigate in this context is the regional rate of new firm \nformation, as measured by the rate of new registrations for VAT.11 The possible link between \nthe rate of new firm formation and the share of new hires taken by the unemployed derives \nfrom the notion introduced by Pissarides (1994) that labour markets may generate two types \nof jobs: \"good\" and \"bad\". The former are characterised by higher levels of productivity, but \nalso higher set-up costs, than the latter. Pissarides suggests that only unemployed job-seekers \nwill be willing to take up \"bad\" jobs, as all existing jobs are at least as productive (and hence, \nas remunerative) as a \"bad\" job with zero tenure. Following this line of argument, we \nhypothesise that a high proportion of the jobs generated by the formation of new firms may be \nperceived, at least, by job-seekers to be \"bad\" jobs. It is well known, for example, that failure \nrates amongst young firms are relatively high (Storey, 1994), so that the expected duration of \na job generated by a new firm will tend to be relatively short. If workers cannot costlessly \nreturn to employment following the loss of a job then job-seekers who are currently in \nemployment may be reluctant to take up a job created by a new firm. \n The final component of equation (1) is \u03c1, the offer acceptance probability. Here we \n                                                          \n10Additionally, we might extend the argument of Gregg and Petrongolo (1997), \napplied previously to the inflow into unemployment, and suggest that recent in-migrants may \nbe able to match with a bigger pool of vacancies than the incumbent unemployed. This would \nreinforce the arguments leading us to expect a positive relationship between the rate of in-\nmigration and the share of new hires captured by the unemployed. \n11For a discussion of the limitations of new registrations for VAT as a measure of new \nfirm formation, see for example, Robson (1996). \n 12 \nfollow Burgess and Broersma and hypothesise that this will be mainly dependent on the \nbenefit replacement rate. In the present context, this leads us to expect a positive relationship \nbetween the regional level of average earnings and the rate of outflows from unemployment \nwhich will tend to counter-act the negative relationship identified previously. \n \n3.  Empirical Analysis \n \n For the purposes of empirical analysis, we take a log-linear version of equation (1) \nand substitute for \u03bbit, \u03b8it and \u03c1it in terms of their hypothesised determinants. Introducing lags \nto allow for the presence of dynamics in the relationship between the explanatory variables \nand the regional unemployment outflow rate leads us to estimate an error-correction equation \nof the form: \n \n\u2206ln xit = \u03b1 + \u03b21'\u2206Wit + \u03b22' Wit-1 - \u03b3 ln xit-1 + region & time dummies + \u03b5it  (4) \n \nwhere W is the vector of explanatory variables discussed in the previous section (including \nthe regional unemployment rate) and  \u03b5it is a random error term. \n  To recap, the dependent variable in our analysis is the (first difference of the) log of \nthe regional rate of outflows from unemployment relative to the civilian labour force, whilst \nthe elements of W are: u, the regional (beginning of period) unemployment rate; the regional \nrate of hiring, h, defined as the (adjusted) number of vacancy outflows relative to the civilian \nworkforce; the regional rates of gross in and out-migration relative to the civilian workforce, \nimg and omg; regional average earnings, w; the proportion of the (beginning of period) \nunemployed who are aged under 25, u25; the proportion aged 55 or over (50 or over from \n1989), older; the proportion of the unemployed with durations of at least 52 weeks, ltu; the \nratio of current period inflows into unemployment relative to the beginning of period stock, \ninf; the variance of unemployment rates between the constituent counties of each region, \nvaru; the number of Restart interviews conducted in each region as a proportion of the \nnumbers unemployed for at least six months, rest; and finally, the number of new \nregistrations for VAT relative to the civilian labour force, vat.12  \n                                                          \n12All the elements of W appear in the equation in log form, apart from rest. Note that \nonly the current dated value of inf is included in the equation as lagged values would be \n 13 \n The role of the time dummies in equation (4) has already been discussed. The region \ndummies are included to pick up any long-term factors which might lead to regional \ndifferences in the outflow rate from unemployment at a given rate of hires, including for \nexample, the density of the regional job-centre network. \nData \n Before moving on to discuss the details of the empirical analysis, it is worth pausing \nto say a little more about the nature of the data on regional unemployment flows which we \nuse in this study. The data are based on the flows of individuals into and out of the official \nmonthly count of those claiming unemployment benefit. The figures are therefore subject to \nthe same definitional changes and other discontinuities - chronicled in Martin and Sunley \n(1997) - which afflicted the official count of the stock of unemployed over the 1983-1994 \nperiod. In addition, however, it should be noted that the flow series relate to computerised \nclaims only and therefore exclude a proportion of claimants - those whose claims were \nprocessed clerically - who would have been included in the official figures for the \nunemployment stock.  The flow series therefore under-record the actual number of \nindividuals moving in and out of unemployment. Most of the under-recording occurred with \nrespect to outflows, in that a significant number of the unemployed who ceased to claim were \nnot officially classified as outflows from unemployment. The scale of this under-recording \nproblem declined significantly over the sample period, so that by the mid-1990s only a small \nproportion of claims were non-computerised. \n On the face of it, there seems little reason to suppose that the impact of either the \nadministratively induced changes to the definition of unemployment or the under-recording of \nunemployment flows will have differed significantly across the regions. Their effects should \ntherefore be absorbed by the time dummies in the empirical model.13 More troubling for the \nanalysis of the present paper is that whereas the theoretical discussion of the previous Section \nfocused on flows of individuals out of unemployment into employment, the data on \n                                                                                                                                                                                    \ncollinear with ltu. \n13One possible exception is the impact of Section 7 of the 1988 Social Security Act, \nwhich put some people aged 55 or over on pensions instead of unemployment benefit. The \neffects of this provision should be absorbed by the variable older in our model. \n 14 \nunemployment outflows embraces not only transitions into employment but also exits of \nindividuals from the labour force. Studies by Green et al. (1997) and Martin and Sunley \n(1997) using Labour Force Survey data indicate that there are regional differences in the \nresponse of labour force participation rates to fluctuations in the business cycle. Whilst some \nof these regional differences in exits from the labour force - those associated with retirement \nflows, for example - may be captured by the explanatory variables in the model, our neglect \nof a more explicit consideration of this issue clearly weakens to some extent the power of the \nempirical analysis.  \nResults \n Equation (4) was estimated by Instrumental Variables on annual data for the ten \nstandard regions of Great Britain for the period 1984-94 (i.e. a total of 110 observations), \nwith the first difference of the logged rates of regional in and out-migration treated as \nendogenous.14  The equation was then tested down in the usual way by deleting insignificant \nterms and reparameterising where appropriate. Finally, the preferred specification which \nemerged from this general-to-specific modelling exercise was re-estimated using a more \nparsimonious version of the original instrument set. The resulting equation is shown in \ncolumn (1) of Table  1. \n Most of the variables hypothesised as potential determinants of the regional rate of \noutflows from unemployment appear in the equation in some form - the exceptions being the \nregional level of average earnings and the proportion of older workers in the unemployment \nstock. The coefficient of the Restart variable is not statistically significant but indicates that \nthe scheme may have had a weak effect in raising the competitiveness of unemployed job-\nseekers. We consider the interpretation of this finding in more detail below.  \n As might be expected, the results indicate that it is the regional rate of unemployment \nwhich is the dominant influence on the rate of outflows from unemployment as a proportion \n                                                          \n14The additional instruments used were the current and one period lagged values of \nregional house prices. The starting date for the sample period is dictated by the availability of \ndata on regional unemployment and vacancy flows, which is first available from June 1983. \nThe 1983 observations for x and h are based on flows for the second half of the year, with \ndata on variables relating to the beginning of period stock of unemployment defined \naccordingly. Finally, the observations on img and omg for this year are computed by dividing \nthe annual migration figures by two. \n 15 \nof the workforce. In contrast, the hiring rate, h, appears to play a relatively minor role - the \nestimates indicate that, other things equal, a 10 percent increase in the rate of new hires in \nregion i leads in the long-run to just a 0.6 percent increase in the rate of outflows from \nunemployment. This finding corroborates the impression gained from the graphs in Figure 1 \nand is consistent with the results of Burgess (1993), who finds an aggregate hiring rate \nelasticity insignificantly different from zero for much of the sample period he studies.15 We \nconsidered the possibility that simultaneity between ln hit and ln xit may have biased \ndownwards our estimate of the hiring rate elasticity and tried instrumenting ln hit with the log \nof the rate of vacancy inflows but this made virtually no difference to the results.16 \n  The estimates in column (1) suggest that we may impose the restriction that the long-\nrun coefficients on ln hit and ln uit sum to unity. This restriction, which is easily accepted, \nimplies that in the long-run the rate of outflows from unemployment relative to the beginning \nof period stock is proportional to the ratio of new hires to the number of unemployed, so that \nfor example a doubling of the number of new hires and the number unemployed has no effect \non the outflow rate from unemployment, which is intuitively appealing.17 Column (2) of \nTable 1 reports the estimates obtained when this additional restriction is imposed. Finally, \nfollowing Burgess's example, we investigated the possibility that there may be non-linearities \nin the determinants of the job offer arrival rate by adding terms in (ln uit)2 and (ln uit.ln hit) \nto the equation shown in column  (1). These additional terms turned out to be jointly \ninsignificant (\u03c72 (2) = 1.69 versus a 5 percent critical value of 5.99) and therefore in contrast \nto Burgess we find no evidence of significant non-linearities. \n Both of the reported sets of estimates indicate fairly clearly that regional variations in \nthe rate of outflows from unemployment are primarily the result of variations in the share of \nnew hires taken by the unemployed, rather than regional variations in the rate of hiring. The \nlevel of inflows into unemployment relative to the beginning of period stock appears to be the \n                                                          \n15Burgess estimates a non-linear relationship between the hiring rate and the rate of \noutflows from unemployment, in such a way that the hiring rate elasticity increases with the \nrate of unemployment. We consider the issue of non-linearity below. \n16The estimates may be obtained from the author, on request. \n17A chi-squared test of this restriction gives a value of 1.07, compared with a 5 \npercent critical value (with one degree of freedom) of 3.84. \n 16 \ndominant influence on the share of new hires captured by the unemployed, though there is \nalso a much weaker long-run effect from the regional rate of in-migration. The positive \ncoefficient which is found for the latter suggests that a buoyant inflow of migrants into a \nregion leads to compositional changes in the region's unemployment stock which raise the \naverage degree of competitiveness of unemployed job-seekers in the regional job market, and \nthat this dominates the negative effect on outflows which is created by the associated \nreduction in the job offer arrival rate.  \n In addition to the above, there are strong region and time-specific effects on the \nregional rate of outflows from unemployment, illustrated by the highly significant values for \nthe REG and TIME statistics, which test for the deletion of the region and time dummies, \nrespectively. Table 2 reports the estimated parameters and t-ratios of the regional dummies \nfor the equation in column (2) of Table 1 (East Midlands is the omitted region). From these it \ncan be seen that, relative to the East Midlands, the rate of outflows from unemployment is \nsignificantly higher, other things equal, in East Anglia, Yorkshire and Humberside, and the \nSouth West .  \n In the short-run, we observe what might be seen as a more conventional migration \neffect, in that a high rate of out-migration appears to be associated with an increase in the rate \nof outflows from unemployment, as the exit of migrants raises the job offer arrival rate for \nthose seeking work within the region. Additionally in the short-run, the regional rate of \noutflows from unemployment at a given rate of hiring appears to be a positive function of the \nproportion of young workers in the unemployment stock, the rate of new registrations for \nVAT and the variance of county unemployment rates. Of these findings, the first two are \nconsistent with the theoretical conjectures advanced in the previous Section. The third, \nhowever, is contrary to the predicted effect and cannot easily be explained. \n \nInterpreting the Findings for Restart  \n On the face of it, the results presented in Table 1 appear to suggest that the Restart \nscheme has had only very limited success in raising the outflow rate from unemployment. \nThis would seem to contradict the evidence from previous studies (e.g. Lehmann, 1993, \n 17 \nDolton and O'Neill, 1996) which suggests that Restart has indeed been effective in raising the \njob finding prospects of the unemployed. However, there are a number of ways in which these \ncontradictory findings may perhaps be resolved. One possibility is that whilst Restart may \nhave been effective in raising the outflow rate from long-term unemployment, the jobs gained \nby Restart interviewees were ones which might previously have been taken by the short-term \nunemployed. The Restart scheme may therefore have significantly affected the composition of \nthe outflows from unemployment but had relatively little effect on the overall total. Lehmann, \nusing quarterly data for 1982-92, finds some evidence of displacement effects of this sort but \nnevertheless finds that Restart had a positive overall effect on the aggregate rate of outflows \nfrom unemployment.  \n A more likely explanation is that there is simply insufficient independent variation in \nthe data to enable us to identify a significant Restart effect. There is relatively little cross-\nsection variation in the Restart variable and in most years it exhibits a fairly strong correlation \nwith the regional rate of unemployment. Most of the independent variation in rest is therefore \nin the time dimension and in these circumstances Restart begins to look like a common \nmacroeconomic shock. Much of the impact of Restart will therefore tend to be absorbed by \nthe time dummies which are included in the estimated equations. It is interesting to note that \nwhen the time dummies are deleted from the regressions it becomes possible to identify a \nsignificantly positive Restart effect.18 \n \nRobustness Checks \n Finally in this Section, we perform two checks for the robustness of the regression \nresults. First, we consider the issue of the homogeneity of the regression parameters across \nthe regions. We have already noted that each of the reported regressions contains a highly \nsignificant set of regional dummies which allows for different regional intercepts in the \nrelationship determining the rate of outflows from unemployment. In Table 3, we report the \nresults of tests for homogeneity of the slope coefficients of the exogenous variables in the \n                                                          \n18Dropping the time dummies, however, results in a significant deterioration in the fit \nof the equations, indicating that the time dummies are picking up the effect of other common \nmacroeconomic influences on regional outflows from unemployment, apart from Restart. \n 18 \nequation reported in column (2) of Table 1. The evidence from these tests indicates that \nallowing for region-specific intercepts is sufficient to capture any substantive heterogeneity in \nthe determination of regional outflows from unemployment.19 \n As a second check we examine the effects of allowing for the biases which may be \nintroduced by the presence of the lagged dependent variable in our estimated equations (see \nNickell, 1981). To deal with these biases - which may potentially affect our estimates of the \neffects of u, inf, and the Restart variable rest, as well as the coefficient for the lagged \ndependent variable - we re-estimated the equations in Table 1 with additional instruments for \nthese variables, as well as \u2206ln omgit as before.\n20\n  \n \n The results of this re-estimation are presented in Table 4 and provide some interesting \ncomparisons with the estimates previously reported. Amongst the newly instrumented \nvariables, the coefficients for the unemployment rate and lagged outflows are of a broadly \nsimilar magnitude to those estimated previously, whilst the coefficient for rest, declines even \nfurther in significance. Elsewhere, the coefficients for the lagged level of the hiring rate \nvariable and the rate of in-migration lose their statistical significance. It is difficult to offer a \nprecise explanation for these changes but given the relatively small changes to the \nunemployment rate and lagged dependent variable coefficients it seems unlikely that they can \nbe wholly explained in terms of biases in the estimates reported in Table 1.  Nonetheless, they \nsuggest that we should exercise a degree of caution in our interpretation of the estimates.  \n   \n4. Accounting for Inter-Regional Variations in Unemployment Outflows \n \n  Notwithstanding the above, it is worth considering to what extent the estimates \nreported in the previous Section can help us to understand the causes of inter-regional \nvariations in the rate of outflows from unemployment over recent years. In consideration of \n                                                          \n19Similar results were obtained for the equation in column (1) of Table 1 except that \nhere there is some evidence of regional variation in the speed of adjustment towards long-run \nequilibrium - in particular, the speed of adjustment appears to be slightly quicker than average \nin East Anglia and Scotland, and slightly slower in the North - and in the Restart effect. \n20The potential bias in our estimate of the coefficients for infit and restit arises from \nthe possible correlation between past realisations of the equation error term and the \ndenominator of each variable.  \n 19 \nthis issue, we follow the tradition of previous studies of unemployment flows and focus on \nvariations in the rate of outflows from unemployment relative to the beginning of period \nstock, rather than the workforce as hitherto.21  Table 5 shows the average annual value of the \noutflow rate so defined for the 10 British regions over the period 1984-94. The average \noutflow rate ranges from a high of 183 percent of the beginning of period stock in East Anglia \nto a low of 133 percent in the West Midlands.  \n To try to identify the factors responsible for these regional differences in outflow \nrates, we use the long-run solution to the equation in column (2) of Table 1 (minus the \ninsignificant Restart effect); i.e. \n      \n^\n \n ln (x\/u)i = consti + 0.078 ln (h\/u)i + 0.610 ln infi + 0.043 ln imgi       (5) \n \nwhere the i subscript on the constant term denotes that this is region-specific. We use East \nMidlands as our benchmark region, and for each of the remaining regions calculate the \ndifference relative to the East Midlands in the average value of each of the right-hand side \nvariables in (5). Multiplying by the relevant long-run coefficient then enables us to obtain a \nbreakdown of the predicted difference in the average rate of outflows between each region \nand the East Midlands, which in turn may be compared with the actual observed difference. \n The results of this exercise are displayed in Table 6. These show first of all that for the \nmajority of regions the predicted difference in outflow rates is remarkably close to the \nobserved differential. The largest discrepancies are in the predicted differential for Wales and \nthe West Midlands, which are each 1.1 percentage points less than the actual differential. The \nsecond major point is that for all of the regions except Scotland the dominant factor which \nexplains the difference in outflow rates relative to the East Midlands is the difference in the \nlevel of unemployment inflows relative to the beginning of year stock. Thus, for example, the \nrelatively high outflow rate in East Anglia may be largely attributed to the fact that a \nrelatively high proportion of those in unemployment in the region at a given time have tended \n                                                          \n21In addition to the paper by Burgess, previous studies of outflows from \nunemployment in the UK using aggregate level data include Nickell (1982), Junankar and \nPrice (1984), Pissarides (1986), Jackman and Layard (1991), Layard, Nickell and Jackman \n(1991), Lehmann (1993) and Harris (1996). \n 20 \nto be recent entrants to unemployment who, for reasons outlined in Section 2, tend to enjoy a \nrelatively favourable competitive position in the job market. Conversely, the unemployed in \nthe West Midlands have tended to comprise a relatively high proportion of individuals with \nrelatively long durations of unemployment, who may therefore have tended to engage in \nrelatively little job search activity and\/or have been relatively unattractive to employers. The \nunemployed in the West Midlands have therefore tended to capture a relatively small \nproportion of new hires compared with their counterparts in the East Midlands.22 \n Compared with the ratio of inflows into unemployment, relative migration flows and \nthe rate of hiring appear to play a relatively minor role. In particular, the results in Table 6 \nconfirm the impression gained from the graphs in Figure 1, that differences in the rate of \nhiring account for only a very small proportion of differences in regional rates of outflows \nfrom unemployment. \n \n5.  Conclusions \n \n We have investigated the determinants of regional variations in outflows from \nunemployment, focusing in particular on the role of variations in the competitiveness of \nunemployed job-seekers relative to those searching on-the-job. We have used an adjusted data \non off-flows of vacancies notified to job-centres to proxy for the level of new hires in the \nregional economy and our empirical analysis indicates that variations in the rate of new hires \naccount for only a small proportion of regional variations in the rate of outflows from \nunemployment. Instead, we find that variations in the share of new hires taken by the \nunemployed, reflecting variations in the degree to which the unemployed represent effective \n                                                          \n22An alternative interpretation of the dominant role found for the inflow rate relative \nto the beginning of period stock is that it merely reflects the fact that in a steady state the level \nof inflows into unemployment will be equal to the level of outflows. There are two objections \nto this. The first is that over the period 1984-94, unemployment cannot really be said to have \nbeen in a steady state. Nationally, there was a fall of just over 1 percentage point in the \naverage rate of unemployment between these two years (Economic Trends Annual \nSupplement, 1997), and this was accompanied by significant changes in the regional structure \nof unemployment. Secondly, the effect which we identify for the inflow rate is obtained in the \npresence of a control for the rate of new hires and therefore represents the effect on the \noutflow rate at a given rate of hiring. If the 'steady state' interpretation were correct, it seems \nunlikely that we would be able to identify such a strong separate effect from variations in the \ninflow rate.   \n 21 \ncompetitors in regional job markets, account for much of the observed inter-regional variation \nin outflows from unemployment.  \n The principal influences on the share of new hires captured by the unemployed appear \nto be the rate of inflows into regional unemployment relative to the initial stock and, to a \nmuch lesser degree, the rate of regional in-migration relative to the workforce. Both of these \nfactors are associated with an influx into regional unemployment of a pool of relatively active \ncompetitors in the market for jobs and their effect is to raise the average competitiveness of \nunemployed workers in the region relative to other participants in the market for new hires. In \nthe case of migration this effect outweighs the negative effect on outflows which arises from \nthe inflow of in-migrants who move directly into jobs which might otherwise have been taken \nby the resident unemployed. However, discussion of the in-migration effect is tempered with  \na note of caution as the significance of this variable turns out to be sensitive to treatment of \nthe biases which may arise from the presence of a lagged dependent variable in the regression \nspecification.  \n On the policy front, we find that the Restart programme, which was designed to aid \nthe unemployed in the process of finding work, has only a very limited role in explaining \nregional variations in outflows from unemployment. This finding, which appears to contradict \nthe results of previous studies of the effectiveness of Restart, may perhaps be taken to \nindicate that Restart has had the effect of a common macroeconomic shock, the impact of \nwhich is therefore largely captured by the time dummies which we have included in our \nestimated equations. \n The findings concerning the effects of Restart aside, the results of this study \nemphasise the importance to regional employment policy of measures aimed at raising the \ncompetitiveness of the unemployed in the market for jobs. Measures designed to facilitate a \nmore even regional distribution of new hires by themselves, it seems, are unlikely to be \nsuccessful in alleviating the problem of regional disparities in unemployment.    \n 22 \nTable 1.

Regional Unemployment Rates and the Share of New Hires Captured by the \nUnemployed: Annual Averages, 1984-94. \n \n \n 36 \nData Appendix \n \nx - Outflows From Unemployment Relative to the Civilian Workforce \n \nFor 1984-94, the outflow figures represent the number of persons ceasing to claim \nunemployment benefit in each year (computerised claims only). For 1983, we have figures on \noutflows from June to December only. The Civilian Workforce is measured at the beginning \nof the relevant period, so that for 1983 we use the June figure, whereas for all subsequent \nyears the January figure is used. Data on unemployment outflows was obtained from the \nNational On-line Manpower Information Service (NOMIS) at the University of Durham, \nwhilst Civilian Workforce figures were obtained from various issues of the Employment \nGazette (EG). \n \nh - (Adjusted) Vacancy Outflows Relative to the Civilian Workforce. \n \nAs with the unemployment outflow data, for 1983 we use information on vacancy flows for \nJune to December only. For all subsequent years the figures refer to total annual off-flows of \nvacancies at job-centres. The vacancy flow data are adjusted to allow for the fact that only a \nfraction of total vacancies are  notified to job-centres, using the method used by Jackman, \nLayard and Pissarides (1989); i.e. we multiply the vacancy outflow figures for each region by \nthe ratio of a measure of aggregate engagements based on Inland Revenue P45 data to the \naggregate level of vacancy outflows. The source for the vacancy flow data is NOMIS. The \nInland Revenue P45 data were supplied by Professor Stephen Nickell. \n \nu - Unemployed as a Proportion of the Civilian Workforce \n \nWe use the beginning of period stock of unemployed individuals, so that for 1983, the June \nfigure is used, but for all subsequent years we use the figure from the January count. Source: \nEG (various issues). \n \nimig, omig  - Number of  In and Out-migrants Relative to the Civilian  Workforce \n \nThe numerator in each case is the gross number of migrants based on National Health Service \nCentral Register (NHCR) records, reported in various issues of Population Trends. Figures \nfor 1983 are calculated as half the annual flow for that year. \n \nw - Average Earnings \n \nAverage weekly earnings (less overtime) of male full-time employees in April of each year. \nSource: New Earnings Survey data reported in Regional Trends. \n \nu25 - Proportion of Unemployed Aged 25 or Under \n \nBeginning of period figures. Source: EG, various issues. \n \nolder - Proportion of Unemployed Aged 55 or Over (50 or over from 1989) \n \nBeginning of period figures. Source: EG, various issues. \n \nltu - Proportion of unemployed Out of Work for 52 Weeks or More \n 37 \n \nBeginning of period figures. Source: EG, various issues. \n \ninf - Inflows into Unemployment Relative to Beginning of Period Stock \n \nThe inflow figures represent the number of new claimants to unemployment benefit \n(computerised claims only) in each year. Source: NOMIS.  \n \nvaru - Variance of County Unemployment Rates \n \nVariance of the January (June in the case of 1983) unemployment rates (%) in the constituent \ncounties of each region. Source: author's calculations based on data published in various \nissues of the EG. \n \nrest - Number of Restart Interviews Relative to the Number of Individuals Unemployed for at \nLeast Six Months \n \nRestart data was supplied by Bob Anderton of the National Institute for Economic and Social \nResearch. The original figures relate to Employment Service (ES) regions and fiscal, rather \nthan calendar, years. ES regions differ from the standard regions used elsewhere in the \nanalysis in that: (i) the East Midlands and East Anglia standard regions are combined to form \nan 'East Midlands and Eastern' ES region; and (ii) the ES regions allocate Cumbria to the \n'North West', rather than the 'North' as in the standard regions. The number of Restart \ninterviews in 'East Midlands and Eastern' region was therefore divided between East \nMidlands and East Anglia in proportion to each region's share of their combined total of \nindividuals unemployed for at least six months. A similar device was use to estimate numbers \nof Restart interviews in Cumbria, which were then 'transferred' from the North West region to \nthe North. Finally, the figures were adjusted to a calendar year basis by linear interpolation. \n Beginning of period figures for the number of persons unemployed for at least six \nmonths were obtained from various issues of EG. \n \nvat - New Registrations for VAT Relative to the Civilian Workforce \n \nFigures for the annual number of new registrations for VAT in each region were obtained \nfrom Business Briefing, 23\/10\/92 and various issues of Regional Trends  \n \nRegional House Prices \n \nAverage Dwelling Price for Building Societies' Mortgage Advances.
