INTRODUCTION \nThe two\u2019s complement arithmetic is commonly used for the implementation of \naddition and subtraction operations in digital filters. However, overflow may occur. As \na consequence, digital filters with two\u2019s complement arithmetic may exhibit limit cycle \n 2 \nbehaviors [1] or chaotic behaviors [2]-[11]. \nThe existing investigations on the chaotic behaviors of digital filters with two\u2019s \ncomplement arithmetic are mainly on the admissibility and periodicity of the symbolic \nsequences [2], [4], [6]-[11]. Some investigations have been extended to the \nsaturation-type [3] and quantization-type [5] nonlinearities. However, very little \nliterature has discussed on the statistical properties of the state variables of these \nsystems [12]. When the digital filters exhibit chaotic behaviors, one may expect that the \nstate variables may reach any values between the maximum and minimum numbers in \nthe possible region and uniform probability distribution may obtain. The condition for \nobtaining a uniform distribution was derived in [12]. However, we do not know the \ndistribution when the condition stated in [12] violates. In this letter, we find that the \npossibility of occurrence of the state variable of first-order digital filters with two\u2019s \ncomplement arithmetic is close to zero in certain region no matter what the initial \ncondition is. In this letter, we investigate this issue and some analytical results are \ngiven. \nAn outline for the other sections of this letter is as follows: Analytical and \nsimulation results are presented in Section II. Conclusion is given in Section III. \n \nII. ANALYTICAL AND SIMULATION RESULTS \nAssume that a first-order digital filter with two\u2019s complement arithmetic can be \nrepresented by the following state space model: \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\uf028 \uf029kukxafkx \uf02b\uf0d7\uf03d\uf02b1 , (1) \nwhere a  is the filter parameter, \uf028 \uf029ku  is the input signal, \uf028 \uf029kx  is the state variable, and \nf  is the nonlinearity due to the use of two\u2019s complement arithmetic, which is the \nFrobenius-Perron operator [12]. In this letter, we assume that \uf028 \uf029 0\uf03dku  for 0\uf0b3k  and \nthe whole system is only influenced by the initial state. The nonlinearity f  can be \n 3 \nmodeled as: \n\uf028 \uf029 nf \uf0d7\uf02d\uf03d 2\uf06e\uf06e  (2) \nsuch that \n1212 \uf02b\uf0d7\uf03c\uf0a3\uf02d\uf0d7 nn \uf06e  (3) \nand Zn\uf0ce , in which Z  denotes the set of integers. Hence, the digital filters with two\u2019s \ncomplement arithmetic can be represented as: \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029kskxakx \uf0d7\uf02b\uf0d7\uf03d\uf02b 21 , for 0\uf0b3k , (4) \nwhere \uf028 \uf029 11 \uf03c\uf0a3\uf02d kx  and \uf028 \uf029 \uf07b \uf07dmmks ,,1,0,1,, \uf04c\uf04c \uf02d\uf02d\uf0ce , in which m is the minimum \ninteger satisfying \uf028 \uf029 1212 \uf02b\uf0d7\uf03c\uf0d7\uf0a3\uf02d\uf0d7\uf02d mkxam . Since \uf028 \uf029ks  is an element in the discrete \nset \uf07b \uf07dmm ,,1,0,1,, \uf04c\uf04c \uf02d\uf02d , the values of \uf028 \uf029ks  can be viewed as symbols and \uf028 \uf029ks  is \ncalled a symbolic sequence. \nIn this letter, we only consider the case when 21 \uf03c\uf03c a . In this case, since the pole \nof the digital filter is outside the unit circle, random like chaotic behaviors would occur \nand it is expected that in the long run the state variable may reach any values in \uf05b \uf0291,1\uf02d . \nHowever, we have conducted extensive simulations and find that the possibility of \noccurrence of the state variable in certain region is close to zero. The results are \nsummarized in the following Lemma. \nLemma 1: \nIf 21 \uf03c\uf03c a , the possibility of occurrence of the state variable in the region \n\uf028 \uf029aa \uf02d\uf02d 2,2  is close to zero. \nProof \nAlthough the digital filters with two\u2019s complement arithmetic are deterministic \nsystems, that is, the values of the state variable and the symbolic sequence at any \nparticular time index can be calculated exactly once the initial condition and the filter \nparameter are known, we can always plot the histogram of the state variable and \ncompute the possibility of occurrence of different values of the symbolic sequences. \n 4 \nLet the normalized histogram of the state variable be \uf028 \uf029xpX , that is \uf028 \uf029 1\n1\n1\n\uf03d\uf0f2\uf02d dxxpX . \nDefine \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\n\uf0ef\uf0ee\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ed\n\uf0ec \uf03c\uf0a3\uf02d\uf03d\notherwise\na\nx\na\nxpxq X\n0\n11\n, (5) \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\n\uf0ef\uf0ee\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ed\n\uf0ec \uf03c\uf0a3\uf03d\notherwise\nx\na\nxpxr X\n0\n11 , (6) \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\n\uf0ef\uf0ee\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ed\n\uf0ec \uf02d\uf03c\uf0a3\uf02d\uf03d\notherwise\na\nxxpxt X\n0\n11 , (7) \n\uf028 \uf029xafy \uf0d7\uf03d , (8) \nand the normalized histogram of y  be \uf028 \uf029ypY , where \uf028 \uf029 1\n1\n1\n\uf03d\uf0f2\uf02d dyypY , then we have: \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029xtxrxqxpX \uf02b\uf02b\uf03d  (9) \nand \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6 \uf02d\uf0d7\uf02b\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6 \uf02b\uf0d7\uf02b\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\uf0d7\uf03d\na\nxt\naa\nxr\naa\nxq\na\nxpY\n21211 . (10) \nFor the digital filters with two\u2019s complement arithmetic, we can assume \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029xpxp XY \uf03d . \nHence we have: \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6 \uf02b\uf0d7\uf02b\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\uf0d7\uf03d\na\nxr\naa\nxq\na\nxt 211 , for \na\nx 11 \uf02d\uf03c\uf0a3\uf02d , (11) \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6 \uf02b\uf0d7\uf02b\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\uf0d7\uf03d\na\nxr\naa\nxq\na\nxq 211 , for 21 \uf02d\uf03c\uf0a3\uf02d ax\na\n, (12) \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\uf0d7\uf03d\na\nxq\na\nxq 1 , for axa \uf02d\uf03c\uf0a3\uf02d 22 , (13) \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6 \uf02d\uf0d7\uf02b\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\uf0d7\uf03d\na\nxt\naa\nxq\na\nxq 211 , for \na\nxa 12 \uf03c\uf0a3\uf02d , (14) \nand \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6 \uf02d\uf0d7\uf02b\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\uf0d7\uf03d\na\nxt\naa\nxq\na\nxr 211 , for 11 \uf03c\uf0a3 x\na\n. (15) \nAccording to (13), we have \uf028 \uf029\nx\ncxq \uf03d  where c  is a constant, or \uf028 \uf029 0\uf03dxq . Since \n 5 \n\uf028 \uf029\nx\ncxq \uf03d  is not a valid normalized histogram function because \uf028 \uf029dxxq\na\na\uf0f2\n\uf02d\n\uf02d\n2\n2\n diverges, \nso we have \uf028 \uf029 0\uf03dxq . This implies that the possibility of occurrence of the state variable \nin the region \uf028 \uf029aa \uf02d\uf02d 2,2  is close to zero. \uf06e \nFigure 1 shows the simulation results when 5.1\uf03da  and \uf028 \uf029 8.00 \uf03dx . It can be seen \nfrom Figure 1a that although the digital filter with two\u2019s complement arithmetic \nexhibits random like chaotic behaviors, the possibility of occurrence of the state \nvariable in the region \uf028 \uf029aa \uf02d\uf02d 2,2  is close to zero, as shown in Figure 1b. \n \nFigure 1. (a) \uf028 \uf029kx . (b) The normalized histogram of the state variable when 5.1\uf03da  and \uf028 \uf029 8.00 \uf03dx . \nIt is worth noting that even though the state trajectory depends on the initial \ncondition, the derivation of Lemma 1 does not involve the initial condition. So, our \nresults are still valid no matter what the initial conditions are. Figure 2 shows the \nsimulation results when 5.1\uf03da  and \uf028 \uf0290x  is generated randomly. We can see that \nFigure 2 depicts results which are similar to those of Figure 1. \n 6 \n \nFigure 2. (a) \uf028 \uf029kx . (b) The normalized histogram of the state variable when 5.1\uf03da  and the initial \ncondition is generated randomly. \n \nIII. CONCLUSION \nIn this letter, we have investigated the normalized histogram of the state variable \nof first-order digital filters with two\u2019s complement arithmetic. When the pole of the \ndigital filters with two\u2019s complement arithmetic is between 1 and 2, it is found and \nexplained that the possibility of occurrence of the state variable in certain region is very \nclose to zero. \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nThe work obtained in this letter was supported by a research grant (project number \nG-YD26) from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. \n \nREFERENCES \n[1] G.
