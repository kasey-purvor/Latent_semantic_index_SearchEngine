While the period immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union was met, for the \nmost part, by triumphalist proclamations of the \u2018end of history\u2019 (Fukuyama, 1992) much \npolitical discourse during the 1990s turned to more pessimistic, even apocalyptic, visions of \n\u2018the clash of civilisations\u2019 (Huntington, 1994), \u2018the coming anarchy\u2019 (Kaplan, 1994), and the \n\u2018new world disorder\u2019 (Anderson, 1992). It is these latter images which seem vindicated by \nrecent events \u2013 9\/11, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the challenge posed by a \nvicissitude of new security threats from airborne diseases that fail to recognise borders to the \nsustained exploitation of the world\u2019s natural resources. Despite this, more optimistic voices \ncontinue to be heard: those who highlight the possibilities of a new \u2018global covenant\u2019 fostered \nby social democracy (Archibugi et al, 1998; Jackson, 2003; Held, 2004), those who focus on \nthe growing significance of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and new social \nmovements which band together in an apparently burgeoning global civil society (Kaldor, \n2003; Barber, 2004; Falk, 2004), those who exalt in the peace and prosperity generated by the \nEuropean Union as it expands to the east and south (Habermas, 2001; Rifkin, 2004; Leonard, \n2005; M\u00fcnkler, 2007), as well as those who support the broader development of \u2018governance \nwithout government\u2019 as represented by the spread of international organisations and \ninternational regimes over increasing numbers of issue areas and regions around the world \n(Rosenau and Czempiel, 1992; Shaw, 2000). So it is that lines are drawn, visions are \npolarised, and debate commences.  \n \n3 \n Of course, if so many learned commentators are convinced that the current historical \nperiod represents some kind of unique opening in which things are, at least to some extent, \n\u2018up for grabs\u2019, then it is not unreasonable to assume that something interesting is going on. \nBut what? Is it the doomsayers or the romantics who are generating the more compelling \ninsights into the unsettled topography of contemporary world politics? Perhaps \nunsurprisingly, the answer is neither. More interestingly, it turns out that both groups are \nwrong for the same reason \u2013 they are allowing the general fluidity of the post-Cold War era \nto cloud their political judgement. In short, utopia is running ahead of reality. This is not \nunusual \u2013 in periods of uncertainty, ideology often becomes elevated from a broadly \nfunctional explanation for \u2018why\u2019 things are to a more transcendent set of ideas about \u2018how\u2019 \nsocial relations can be made afresh (Mannheim, 1960; Ricoeur, 1986; Mann, 1986; Kumar, \n1987). Yet the shift from ideology to utopia is no idle problem, for what it tends to generate \nare images which often lie outside, beyond or on top of history rather than visions which take \ntheir roots from what is immanent within history. This article is an attempt to provide a \ncorrective to, at least, parts of this malady by carrying out a zeitdiagnose (diagnosis of our \ntimes) which questions some of the taken-for-granted assumptions about the current period, \nseeking to develop concrete abstractions which are grounded in \u2018actually existing\u2019 conditions. \nThe result are \u2018realistic utopias\u2019 which build from history to mid-range abstractions rather \nthan universal utopias which work from general abstractions to events on the ground. This \nconstruct is, perhaps, more modest than those offered by both utopians and dystopians alike. \nIndeed, it is an attempt to steer, nudge and guide world historical processes rather than to \ntransform them from some kind of tabula rasa (Wendt, 2001). \n The starting point for this paper is an engagement with the work of leading \ncosmopolitan thinker, Nancy Fraser. Fraser\u2019s schema, as outlined below, provides a \ncompelling framework for exploring the possibilities of cosmopolitanism in the post-Cold \n \n4 \nWar world. But there is a fundamental problem in Fraser\u2019s work which risks doing harm to \nher general project. For, if ideas of justice and progress are to be rooted in actually existing \nhistorical conditions, then careful thought needs to take place into what history is actually \nproviding in terms of raw materials. For those, like Fraser, who are committed to a critical, \nnormative diagnosis of the current conjuncture and who are engaged in transformative \nframing in which issues of justice can reach beyond existing political boundaries, there needs \nto be more clarity about what is being transformed, and where and when this is likely to \nsucceed. The argument proceeds in four sections. First, the broad dimensions of Fraser\u2019s \nthinking are outlined and its principal limitations assessed. The second section looks in more \ndetail at the specific normative frames employed by Fraser, examining their historical, \ntemporal and spatial dimensions. In the third part, an alternative analysis of the current \nconjuncture is outlined, drawing on the work of the British historian and commentator E.H. \nCarr and, in particular, on Carr\u2019s critique of inter-war utopianism. The final part of the paper \nrounds off the argument and suggests areas for further development.  \n \n \nThe limits of utopia \n \nPerhaps the principal reason for the capacity of the current period to squirm away from easy \nanalysis is the sheer range of assaults being undertaken on the previously taken-for-granted \nordering mechanisms of the modern era. The apparent triumph of Hayek over Keynes, the \npluralisation of cultural signifiers and the rise of relativism, and perhaps most importantly, \nthe seeming abandonment by publics in market democracies of a sense of the capacity of \npolitics to fundamentally reshape social relations has generated, at least in the West, systemic \nimperatives which appear as a \u2018runaway world\u2019 in which citizen-consumers are swept \n \n5 \nasunder before the inevitable might of globalisation, the market, democracy and other such \njuggernauts (Giddens, 1999; Gellner, 1988; Hay, 2007). Broad trends such as individualism, \nsecularism and consumerism represent, as the German theorist J\u00fcrgen Habermas (1994) puts \nit, nothing less than the \u2018opening of organised modernity\u2019. For Habermas, the fusion of public \nand private generated by these processes has seen the uncaging of modernity\u2019s social \nrelations and the \u2018monetarisation of the lifeworld\u2019. These forces, with their associated \nresidues of anomie, dislocation and uncertainty (Gray, 1997; Stoker, 2006; Mulgan and \nBuonfoni, 2006), are compounded by the multiple insecurities of contemporary world \npolitics. \n Along with other leading cosmopolitan thinkers, Nancy Fraser has met these multiple \nchallenges with a reassertion of the emancipatory potential contained within critical theory. \nIn her most recent work (Fraser and Naples, 2004; Fraser, 2005; Fraser, 2007a; Fraser, \n2007b; Fraser, forthcoming), Fraser has focused on how the current historical conjuncture \u2013 \ncharacterized as a situation of \u2018abnormal justice\u2019 \u2013 requires a three dimensional theory of \njustice centred on the master frames of redistribution, recognition and representation. This \nmove, a return to a Weberian triad of class, status and party, represents an extension of \nFraser\u2019s earlier work (1995, 2000; Fraser and Honneth, 2003), which employed a two \ndimensional theory of justice based around redistribution and recognition. The addition of a \nthird dimension \u2013 representation \u2013 comes about, Fraser argues, because of the acceleration of \nglobalisation and the instabilities of contemporary geopolitical relations which have produced \nan \u2018overflow\u2019 in the sovereign (Westphalian) state frame (Fraser, 2007a). Fraser argues that \nthese three dimensions of justice represent holding bays for substantive economic \n(redistributive), political (representative) and social (recognition) relations respectively, with \nnone determinant over, or completely autonomous from, the others. Rather (2005: 79, f.11), \n\u2018the three dimensions stand in relations of mutual entwinement and reciprocal influence\u2019. \n \n6 \n Fraser\u2019s main theme is what she sees as the deleterious consequences of the elevation \nof the struggle for recognition over those of redistribution and representation. The unintended \nconsequence of this \u2018tragic historical irony\u2019 (Fraser and Naples, 2004: 1111) is a \u2018new \nobscurity \u2026 in which progressive currents lack both a coherent vision of an alternative to the \npresent order and also a plausible scenario as to how such a vision, if one existed, could \nconceivably be realized\u2019 (in Nash and Bell, 2007). In other words, just as the shift towards \nrecognition renders activists seemingly incapable of engaging head-on with the central \npolitical imperative of the contemporary world, so it also leaves theorists without the means \nto adequately conceptualise this order. The rise of recognition to the detriment of both \nredistribution and representation generates a gap between theory and practice, and turns an \nanalytical construct into an ontological cleavage with potentially ruinous consequences, not \nleast in the generation of acute levels of deprivation and inequality fostered by a seemingly \nunfettered neoliberalism. For Fraser the key to reinvigorating cosmopolitan thinking, and \nprogressive social struggles, in the contemporary world is to understand that there must be \n\u2018no recognition without redistribution\u2019, or as she now contends (Fraser, 2005: 79), \u2018no \nredistribution or recognition without representation\u2019. \n This article does not take issue with Fraser\u2019s assessment of the present historical \nconjuncture as novel, nor her reassertion of the centrality of issues of redistribution. Rather, \nthis article uses Fraser\u2019s framework as a starting point for exploring broader issues about the \nrelationship between \u2018ideal theory\u2019 and historical practice. Fraser claims that any view of \njustice in these \u2018abnormal times\u2019 should be reflexive and substantive, dialogic and \ninstitutional, normative and procedural. For Fraser, although contemporary conditions share a \ncertain similarity with other \u2018abnormal periods\u2019 such as the interregnum between feudal pre-\nWestphalian Europe and its Westphalian successor, current debates have a historical \nspecificity derived from a number of associated trends, most notably globalisation and US \n \n7 \nmilitarism. The instability of contemporary world politics has generated a \u2018heteroglossia of \njustice discourse\u2019 which \u2018trespasses the bounds of state-centred grammars\u2019 (Fraser, \nforthcoming). Crucially, Fraser claims that the role of the critical theorist in these abnormal \ntimes is to act as a \u2018situated thinker\u2019, working at a relative distance from social struggles \nwhile also developing analysis which is derived from the \u2018historically emergent possibilities \nfor emancipation\u2019 (in Nash and Bell, 2007). Although Fraser recognises the tensions of \nkeeping theoretical and practical orientations simultaneously in view, she nevertheless views \nthis as a fundamental dimension of her work, maintaining the Frankfurt School tradition of \nzeitdiagnose by \u2018supplying a background understanding of historical possibilities in terms of \nwhich one can situate and evaluate the struggles of our times\u2019 (Fraser and Naples, 2004: \n1007). As such (Fraser, 2007a: 2), \n \nOn the one hand, one should avoid an empiricist approach that simply adapts the \ntheory to the existing realities, as that approach risks sacrificing its normative force. \nOn the other hand, one should also avoid an externalist approach that invokes ideal \ntheory to condemn social reality, as that approach risks forfeiting critical tradition. \nThe alternative, rather, is a critical-theoretical approach that seeks to locate normative \nstandards and emancipatory political possibilities precisely within the unfolding \nhistorical constellation.  \n \nThe principal goal of this article is to probe the extent to which Fraser\u2019s framework meets \nthese demands. In the next section of the paper, I begin this task by unpacking Fraser\u2019s \n\u2018taken-for-granted\u2019 assessment of the current conjuncture to be \u2018post-Westphalian\u2019 as a result \nof the \u2018new salience of globalisation\u2019 in which \u2018democratic justice\u2019 provides the leading \nemancipatory frame (Fraser and Naples, 2004: 1117). Before doing so, it is worth clarifying \nthree background conditions which lie behind my argument.  \n The first claim of this essay is that Fraser is offering a symbolic schema which rests \non problematic ontological claims. By doing so, she is verifying a flawed vision of world \n \n8 \npolitics which acts as an ideological cover, or as a new orthodoxy, which paradoxically closes \ndown the space for progressive praxis. In other words, a transformative intention is being \nturned into an affirmative outcome. Imaginary devices like that employed by Fraser require \ncertain nodal points, what Jacques Lacan (1982) calls \u2018points de capiton\u2019, which pin down an \nideational field and stop its meaning from sliding. My argument is that Fraser\u2019s framework \nlacks assured historical points de caption. Instead, there is an attempt to provide a total \nhistory which, pace Agnes Heller (1999), assumes that the \u2018world in distance\u2019 is a \nrepresentative microcosm of our world. Fraser\u2019s universalisation of particularity mistakes, as \nKant might put it, \u2018having a world\u2019 for \u2018knowing the world\u2019, in the process engendering a \nforeclosure which sublates the multilinearity, unevenness, and time and place specificities of \nmodern world history. As Fraser herself recognises (in Nash and Bell, 2007), all processes of \nframing are fundamentally political in that they by necessity engender a degree of closure. As \na result, any assessment of framing devices depends in the first instance on recognising, and \nin the second instance on making a judgement about, the consequences of externalities \ngenerated by them. By interrogating the historical and empirical dimensions which lie behind \nFraser\u2019s framing, it is possible not only to locate the important externalities that they contain, \nbut also to unfix certain taken-for-granted referent points which, in turn, opens up a broader \ncanvass for praxis to emerge.  \n In essence, this paper argues that Fraser\u2019s use of free floating signifiers such as \ndemocracy, globalisation and post-Westphalia represents a hegemonic symbolic field which \nsubsumes the historical remainders, exclusions and surpluses which do not conform to her \ntopos. Disguised as neutral containers, these frames are actually \u2018always-already filled in\u2019 \ncategories (\u017di\u017eek: 1999, 100). In other words, Fraser is providing an ideological mirage \nwhich fixes and, in turn, fetishizes particular discursive frames. By pointing out the gap \nbetween the substance of the history which lies behind Fraser\u2019s claims and the beliefs upon \n \n9 \nwhich these claims are premised, the intention is to open up the field of praxis, and to provide \nalternative positers from which to generate progressive narratives. This task is what Hegel \ncalled \u2018dotting the I\u2019s\u2019 \u2013 retrospectively installing necessity on a world of multiplicity, \ndisruption and overdetermination \u2013 in order to generate shared, if partial, categories which \ncan act as the basis for collective action. The result is intended to be a move towards a field \nof \u2018complex solidarity\u2019, or what Seyla Benhabib (2002) calls \u2018pluralistically enlightened \nuniversalism\u2019, which recognises the importance of generating a dialectical conversation \nbetween difference and universality rather than subordinating one to the other.  \n The article\u2019s second background condition is the depiction of Fraser\u2019s framing as \nutopian. For the progenitor of modern utopian visions, Thomas More (1516\/2003), utopia had \ntwo foundational elements: first, the possibility of a better world; and second, the belief that it \ncould be made. More built on two Greek words: eutopia (good society) and outopia \n(nowhere) to signify an image of another world, another universe, something better than \ncurrent conditions but also man-made and achievable. Early modern utopian thinkers such as \nMore, Francis Bacon and Henry Neville produced works of striking imagination, but they \ncoupled this imagination with prodigious attention to detail, providing maps and alphabets, \nand detailing everyday rituals \u2013 mealtimes, the size of households, forms of acceptable sexual \nconduct and the like \u2013 to an often remarkable extent (Bruce, 1996). As such, these utopias \nwere imbued with claims to spatial and temporal truth which were less about the idealisation \nof people or nature, but about better, more ideal, forms of organisation (Davis, 1984). As \nLouis Marin (1973; in Kumar, 1993) argues, utopias are curious hybrids of \u2018fiction-practice\u2019, \nwhich are at once everywhere and nowhere, and based less in attempts to transcend historical \nconditions than to offer a mirror to them, to critique the status quo, and to promote a novel \ninstitutional order. As such, utopias are both thought experiments and exercises in concrete \nabstraction rooted in a particular reading of past, present and future conditions.  \n \n10 \n This sense of utopia is what lies behind Fraser\u2019s schema. Her work is not only \nintended as a means of imagining the future, but also one based on a particular reading of the \npast and the present. As such, Fraser\u2019s critique of the where-from and the where-now act as \nunder-labourers for her vision of the where-next. And here lies the crucial point. If the first \ntwo parts of this story are distorted, then what we have are \u2018degenerate\u2019 visions (Marin, 1973) \nwhich nullify the world rather than impassion it, and which act to close down possibilities of \npolitical agency. Utopias which provide a cracked mirror to the past and a distorted analysis \nof the present cannot hope to tell us much about future possibilities. Indeed, when this takes \nplace, utopias serve to sanitise the past and to superimpose purity on complexity, acting as a \n\u2018dominant wish\u2019 or as a \u2018static future\u2019 (Mannheim, 1960) which fail to recognise new \nchallenges, forms of contestation and praxis. As such, this is, potentially at least, an important \nshortcoming in Fraser\u2019s work. \n My final background claim is that utopias \u2013 understood as prescriptions for the \nreordering of moral and political life based on analysis and critique of present and past \nconditions \u2013 tend to thrive in \u2018abnormal times\u2019 when the principal contours which shape \nsocial relations are in flux. Most of the time, people tend to accept explanations of their \neveryday lives \u2013 this is the stuff of dominant ideologies as understood by Marx, Gramsci, \nAlthusser, Mannheim, Ricoeur and others. Ideology, in this sense, can be understood as the \nexplanation of \u2018what is\u2019. But during open times \u2013 when the \u2018what is\u2019 lies in flux and when \nunderstandings of the world lie out of kilter with prevailing ideologies \u2013 then ideational \nschemas have the potential to become transcendent rather than immanent, assuming an \nexceptional influence over praxis, choice and policy making. This is the point at which the \nrelationship between ideology and utopia becomes transformed, when forms of utopia are \noffered as a means of critiquing existing conditions, explaining their inequities, and offering a \npath to an alternative future. Ideologies-cum-utopias-cum-ideologies based on democracy, \n \n11 \npost-Westphalia and globalisation represent attempts to perform these functions and to make \nsense of the uncertainty of the contemporary world \u2013 to, as More understood, cleanse the \nworld of insecurity and fear. Such visions offer both risks and possibilities. The possibilities \nlie in their capacity to push at the frontiers of the politics of the possible. The risks lie in the \nelevation of schemas built on faulty foundations to positions of pre-eminence which serve to \npreclude possibilities for radical contestation. It is just this concern which lies behind the \ncritique offered in the next section of this essay. \n \n \nThe Holy Roman Empire redux \n \nFraser\u2019s attempt to offer a philosophical and conceptual apparatus which can underpin \ncontemporary cosmopolitanism and which can root a progressive view of politics \u2013 a belief in \ndemocracy, redistribution and internationalism \u2013 on firm theoretical ground is, in many ways, \nextremely valuable. Yet there is a problem which unsettles the foundations of her work \u2013 the \ntendency for Fraser to abstract normative frames from time, space and history. The result is a \nclosing off of political possibilities via the exclusion of non-conforming peoples, places and \ntimes. In this sense, what we have is a problem of scale and limits, the conjuring of a vision \nwithout borders in a world which continues to rely on borders both for policy making and for \nits political imagination (Brown, 2001). As such, the evaluation of the current conjuncture \noffered by Fraser \u2013 as post-Westphalian, thanks in no small part to the \u2018new salience of \nglobalisation\u2019 which, in turn, fosters possibilities for generating novel forms of democratic \njustice \u2013 appears somewhat reminiscent of Voltaire\u2019s depiction of the Holy Roman Empire: \n\u2018it is neither Holy, nor Roman, nor an empire\u2019.  \n \n \n12 \nPost-Westphalia? \nFraser\u2019s understanding of contemporary world politics as post-Westphalian lies at the centre \nof her work, hence her claim that the post-1989 period has seen an unravelling in \u2018the \nWestphalian-sovereign frame within which struggles for justice of every kind had previously \nbeen confined\u2019 (Fraser and Naples, 2004: 1116-7). Exclusions from this narrative, whether \nunderstood as discourses of human rights, forms of internationalism, or experiences of \ncolonialism are seen as marginal to an otherwise dominant representational frame. And it is \nthis \u2018taken-for-granted\u2019, \u2018goes without saying\u2019 Westphalian frame for political claims-making \nwhich, for Fraser, is under threat from a myriad of sources ranging from globalisation to US \nmilitarism (Fraser and Naples, 2004: 1117). As such, \u2018disputes about justice are exploding the \nKeynesian-Westphalian frame. No longer addressed exclusively to national states or debated \nexclusively by national publics, claimants no longer focus solely on relations among fellow \ncitizens\u2019 (Fraser, 2005: 71-2). \nOf course, the degree to which we understand the current political order as post-\nWestphalian relies on a prior assumption about how Westphalian this order was in the first \nplace. Westphalia is certainly important in as much as it is a representation of a political \nimaginary which posits the formal, reciprocal recognition by nation-states of the political \nsovereignty of other like-units, in other words the process by which composite polities \nbecame caged within a territorially limited, relatively autonomous, centrally demarcated \npolitical unit \u2013 the nation-state. The standard tale usually told to students of both Political \nScience and International Relations is that this model was established in Europe during the \nseventeenth century, and then exported around the world by force of arms, before being \nturned back on the colonial masters, and then gradually superseded, at least in the post-\nmodern zone of the European Union (Cooper, 2000). As such, Westphalia is at once \u2018an \nevent, an idea, a process, and a normative score sheet\u2019 (Falk, 2002: 312). At the very least, so \n \n13 \nthe argument goes, Westphalia provides a hegemonic story for how political imaginaries have \ndeveloped over the last few centuries, with \u2018post-Westphalia\u2019 acting as the leading edge of \nemancipatory possibilities within the contemporary frame of \u2018abnormal justice\u2019. \n There are at least two major problems with this narrative. First, it obscures the fact \nthat formal sovereignty \u2013 the generative grammar of the Westphalian states-system \u2013 is an \n\u2018organized hypocrisy\u2019 (Krasner, 1999) which has consistently been subject to convention, \ncontract, coercion and imposition. Indeed, historically speaking, sovereignty has usually been \na luxury restricted to the great powers \u2013 certainly those in the colonies who appealed for the \nright to national self-determination based on the recognition of formal sovereignty tended to \nfind their petitions falling on deaf ears. It was only after the Hague Conference of 1899 that \nattendance at international conferences included non-Europeans, and it was only at the \nsecond Hague Conference of 1907 that Europeans were outnumbered by non-Europeans. At \nthe Paris Peace talks of 1919, Robert Lansing (in Chandler, 2003:29), the US Secretary of \nState, commented critically on President Wilson\u2019s advocation of the principle of self-\ndetermination, \n \nThe more I think about the President\u2019s declaration of the right of self-determination, \nthe more convinced I am of the danger of putting such ideas into the minds of certain \nraces. It is bound to be the basis of impossible demands and to create trouble in many \nlands. What effect will it have on the Irish, the Indians, the Egyptians, and the \nnationalists among the Boers? Will not the Mohammedans of Syria and Palestine and \npossibly Morocco and Tripoli rely on it? \n \nWilson himself saw self-determination as extendable only to Central Europe, and the League \nof Nations rejected Japan\u2019s request to include a clause on racial equality in its Charter. The \nBolshevik Declaration of the Rights of the Toiling and Exploited People, published in \nJanuary 1918, may have extended principles of rights to the non-West but it was only after \n \n14 \nthe birth of the United Nations that the principle of sovereign equality became more widely \nrecognised. In this sense, sovereignty \u2013 both in terms of legitimate authority and in terms of \npower capabilities \u2013 was a partial game during the modern period, a principle which has been \nrecognised, both in de jure and de facto terms, only relatively recently (Chandler, 2003). \n In fact, until the post Cold-War era, the broader dynamic instituted by the formation \nand break-up of empires has been much more important to the development of the modern \nworld than notions of Westphalian sovereignty. Indeed, world politics in the modern era has \nlargely been oriented around a complex system of hierarchy \u2013 differentiated by time and \nplace \u2013 in which various metropoles have subordinated their congeries (Hobson and \nSharman, 2005). Within this system, authority has been parcelled out in a procession of \nauthority relations, or as Jack Donnelly (2006) prefers, as variations of \u2018hierarchy in \nanarchy\u2019. Throughout the early modern period, various \u2018confetti empires\u2019 (Teschke, 2006), \ncurious public-private hybrids, competed in the formation of hierarchical multi-states systems \naround the world, practising diverse strategies of spatialisastion and territorialisation which \nbrought much of the world within their compass. The subsequent formalisation of land and \nsea empires, and their break-up during the twentieth century produced post-imperial orders, at \nleast in some parts of the world, which ironically enough, required the sanctioning authority \nof imperial powers \u2013 what Niall Ferguson (2005) calls the \u2018imperialism of anti-imperialism\u2019. \nIn this way, Britain repackaged its former colonies as \u2018overseas territories\u2019, granted \ncitizenship rights to its residents, acknowledged the right to self-determination, and supported \nprogrammes of modernisation, both political and economic, as long as the overarching \nrelationship between the former colonial master and newly \u2018independent\u2019 states remained one \nof dependence.2 It was only after the end of the Second World War that empires became \nwidely delegitimised as a form of political authority and imagination, and even then, the post-\ncolonial breaking of European empires required sponsorship by a superpower. The Soviet \n \n15 \nUnion ran an informal empire throughout the Cold War in which claims for national \nsovereignty were regularly engulfed within broader claims of political authority, by force if \nnecessary (Wendt and Friedheim, 1995). France, Portugal and other European states \nmaintained formal empires until the 1970s, and continue to retain dependencies today. Even \nduring the post-Cold War era, there have been debates over whether the United States serves \nas a contemporary form of empire (Ikenberry, 2002; Mann, 2003; Ignatieff, 2003; Cox, \n2004), and to what extent major polities such as China, India and Russia are best understood \nas nation-states or as (post) imperial spaces.3  \n In short, the modern era has seen the development of multiple states-systems which \nlive off the presence of imperial guarantors. As such, the international realm, both during the \nmodern era and further back in history (Little, Kaufman and Wohlforth, 2007), can better be \ncharacterised in terms of imperial or hegemonic hierarchy rather than by sovereign equality \n(Watson, 1992; Cooley, 2005). Indeed, the principal question, at least in the field of \nInternational Relations, now appears to be less geared towards establishing the importance of \nhierarchy to world historical development than in exploring the various logics under which \ndifferent forms of hierarchy operate (Hobson, 2007; Nexon and Wright, 2007). The key point \nis that the broader age of hierarchy\/empire subsumes the Westphalian moment within its \ncanvas, leading us to see the logic of reciprocal sovereignty bounded or caged within the \nnation-state as both recent and limited. As such, if we are to speak of a Westphalian political \nimaginary, we should recognise that it has reached its zenith rather than its nadir in the post-\nCold War world, a period in which state sovereignty \u2013 both as aspiration and practice \u2013 has \nbecome much more extensively available than in previous epochs. For those who fought so \nlong for freedom, particularly in the Third World, Westphalian state sovereignty is both a \nsource of emancipation and the first line of defence against fundamental sources of \ninequality, whether these be historical, economic or geopolitical in origin. As a result, \n \n16 \nattempts at building broader dialogic and institutional forums beyond the nation-state will \ncontinue to run up against some all-too-real obstacles \u2013 witness, for example, the centrality of \nnotions of sovereign authority to debates about trade, development, security, or, somewhat \nmore gruesomely, to the ongoing conflict in Iraq. \n Second, even if we limit Westphalia to certain parts of the world (mainly the West) or \nto a relatively short period in time (the post-war and post-Cold war periods), notions of \nterritorial integrity and sovereignty have never been uncontested, for example by various \nforms of internationalism (Halliday, 1988). In this sense, issues of representation, \nredistribution and recognition were not always delineated clearly and cleanly within bounded \nsovereign states, but often went across and between them via processes of revolution and \ncounter-revolution, and broader notions of political community such as the Islamic umma, \nvarious regional and pan-regional movements, third-worldism, diaspora communities, and, of \ncourse, liberal cosmopolitanism itself. Extending this point, even if we do accept the \nWestphalian order as predominant after 1945, then we must also accept that there were many \nrival forms of political legitimacy and justice during this period, for example the emergence \nof global civil society as invested in the human rights regime. It is illustrative to note that the \nformation of the UN institutionalises these contradictions, recognising as it does both formal \nWestphalian sovereignty as vested in member states, and the universal sanctity of human \nrights (Brown, 2006). Therefore, even during the highpoint of the age of nation-statism, it is \npossible to question the significance of the Westphalian imaginary. And what is striking \nabout the post-Cold War world are the multivalent ways in which states are responding to \nquestions about sovereignty (Sassen, 2006). Alongside the pincer movement represented by \nthe subterranean explosion of authority and rights beneath the nation-state and the \ndenationalisation of authority and rights above the nation-state, are extensive processes of \nrenationalisation, particularly over security policy, as represented, for example, by anti-\n \n17 \nterrorism legislation, the general upsurge in mechanisms of state surveillance, and the war on \nterror itself. Of course, the primary consequence of these processes is a strengthening rather \nthan an erosion in notions of Westphalian sovereignty (Acharya, 2007).  \nThese correctives are not mere diversions from Fraser\u2019s central narrative. In fact, the \ngeneral lack of attention paid to issues of security is a major lacuna in her work. After all, \ncentral to the functioning (in fact to the necessity) of modern states lie claims as to the \nlegitimate use of violence within a particular territory. States are Janus-faced in that they are \nrequired to provide order within their borders and to protect citizens from external threats. \nThis double function is threatened by numerous contemporary processes: terrorist networks \nwhich cross borders and deny the legitimacy of many existing nation-states; the emergence of \nsecurity communities represented by various transnational and international bodies (the \ntransatlantic alliance, NATO and so on); problems which seem to defy borders (from nuclear \nproliferation to human security issues such as the environment or HIV\/AIDS); and what \nMichael Mann (in Lawson 2005c: 494) calls \u2018the underbelly of the revolution in military \naffairs\u2019 \u2013 the striking increase in weapons of the weak ranging from the wide dispersion of \nKalashnikovs to the existential, even nihilistic, threat posed by suicide bombers. Given these \nmultiple challenges, the fundamental security function of the nation-state is under threat \n(Strange, 1999). Yet the extensive renationalisation by states of their security apparatuses \ndoes not indicate merely the last gasp of outmoded relics. Rather, it illustrates the ways in \nwhich the post-Cold War security environment is multiple in form and content, and operates \nas the fulcrum upon which issues of redistribution, representation and recognition can be \npremised. As the renationalisation of core security functions gathers momentum, so it \ncontinues to play a central role in the reassertion of Westphalian sovereignty within what \nmight be better characterised as an age of nationalism rather than as a post-Westphalian era.  \n  \n \n18 \nGlobalisation? \nIf the idea that we are living in a post-Westphalian political imaginary conveys the first part \nof Fraser\u2019s frame, then the second, linked, dimension of her construct is the notion that the \nessential grammar of political claims-making in the contemporary world is being disturbed by \nan epochal change we can best characterise as \u2018globalisation\u2019. Indeed, germane to Fraser\u2019s \nanalysis is the \u2018new salience of globalisation, which is exploding the previously taken-for-\ngranted idea that the bounded nation-state is both the appropriate frame for conceiving \nquestions of justice and the proper arena for waging struggles to achieve it\u2019 (in Nash and \nBell, 2007). As such, \u2018globalisation is changing the way we argue about justice\u2019 (2005: 69). \nFor Fraser, as for globalisation \u2018transformationalists\u2019 such as David Held (1995, 2002, 2004), \nthe spatio-temporal transformation of social, political and economic relations ushered in by \nglobalisation requires a concomitant reordering of national, international and global \ninstitutions alongside a re-imagining of normative frames. For Fraser, the post-Cold War \nworld has seen an \u2018acceleration of globalisation that has fundamentally transformed the \ncircumstances of justice\u2019 (Fraser and Naples, 2004: 1117).  \nThe central issue at stake here is whether globalisation contains causal properties in \nand of itself, or whether the term stands as a descriptive holding pen for a series of processes \nwhich cumulatively denote epochal change and, therefore, a shift in the organisation, and \nimagination, of political, economic and social relations. By claiming that the \u2018new salience of \nglobalisation\u2019 represents the prime mover in the shake-up of the Westphalian frame, Fraser \nappears to be supporting the claim that globalisation contains generative qualities. And yet at \nother times in her work, she seems to loosen this association, depicting globalisation as a \nshell-term for a myriad of associated trends: the spread of finance capital, the increasing \nimportance of units of global governance, the rise of transnational social movements, the \nemergence of global \u2018bads\u2019 ranging from environmental degradation to nuclear proliferation, \n \n19 \nan expansion in flows of people and goods, the shift to post-Fordist production methods, and \nso on. The problem with this dual use of globalisation is that it generates confusion about \nwhether globalisation contains determinant characteristics, or whether it can better be seen as \nan abstract container for otherwise disparate social forces. Globalisation cannot be both, at \nleast not without confusing explanans and explanandum (Rosenberg, 2005). By merging \nthese two meanings of globalisation \u2013 globalisation as determinant process (explanans) and \nas descriptive outcome (explanandum) \u2013 Fraser, and other cosmopolitan theorists, have \ncontributed to a fundamental dilemma: what is globalisation meant to be transforming and \nhow is this transformation taking place? Or to put this question more starkly, does \nglobalisation contain analytical purchase and empirical content in and of itself, or is it a \nsignifier, empty or otherwise, which is restricted to descriptive value?  \nThere are three points of departure which follow from this first order question. First is \nthe issue of whether globalisation contains causal properties. If globalisation is a determinant \nforce in its own right, then it needs to be more than just the intensification of trends \nassociated with modernity itself: the uneven, yet combined, spread of capitalism around the \nworld, the further development of rational, bureaucratic states, the separation of public from \nprivate, and so on. But not only is globalisation difficult to disentangle from these well \nestablished principia media, it is not clear what the referent point of globalisation is intended \nto be (Albert, 2007). Linked to this problem \u2013 perhaps best seen as the \u2018how\u2019 of globalisation \n\u2013 lies a further concern about the \u2018when\u2019 of globalisation. While some theorists focus on the \nways in which globalisation has developed over the longue-dur\u00e9e, in other words on how the \ninterdependence of peoples, economies, cultures and moral codes have built up over a \ntemporal lens measured in eons rather than in decades or centuries (Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto, \n1996; Iriye and Mazlish, 2004), others illustrate the specifically contemporary aspects of \nglobalisation, what Fraser terms its \u2018new salience\u2019. This is a fundamental contradiction, \n \n20 \nraising the spectre of globalisation as the overarching telos of all world historical \ndevelopment, and as a set of issues, challenges and frames which have only taken shape \nrelatively recently. In other words, we have history in toto as captured by globalisation (or \nproto-globalisation), sitting alongside a claim that the contemporary world is uniquely global. \nWithout resolving this issue, the danger is that globalisation becomes both everything and \nnothing (Rosenberg, 2007). Finally, there is the issue of the \u2018where\u2019 of globalisation. A \nnumber of theorists see globalisation as synonymous with Westernisation, or with \nhomogeneity more broadly. But as recent research shows, the roots of the cultural, political \nand economic interdependence of the modern world stem from Eastern origins as much as \nWestern exceptionalism (Abu-Lughod, 1989; Hobson, 2004). Indeed, much of the most \ninteresting literature on globalisation focuses less on Western homogenisation than on forms \nof \u2018glocalisation\u2019, hybridity and heterogeneity (Robertson, 1992; Urry, 2005). As such, \nalongside a need to clarify the \u2018how\u2019 and \u2018when\u2019 of globalisation lies a further requirement to \nestablish the \u2018where\u2019 of globalisation, both in terms of origins and contemporary effects.  \nIf the generative causal properties of globalisation are murky, then it is not evident \nthat globalisation as a descriptive term fares much better. As Michael Mann (1997), Linda \nWeiss (1998), Takeshi Nakano (2006) and others argue, globalisation is merely one aspect, \nperhaps the least significant aspect, of a wider nexus of local, national, international and \ntransnational flows. Other than certain, albeit important, issues \u2013 the spread of finance \ncapital, the threat posed by nuclear weaponry, the sustainability of the environment \u2013 there \nare precious few issues which are constituted primarily at a global level. Even these \nmanifestly \u2018global\u2019 problems require states and state alliances to act as their primary conduits. \nHence global trade rounds, weapons regimes, and agreements to reduce carbon emissions are \nfundamentally subject to inter-state hierarchies and complex state-society relations rather \nthan behoven to global institutional matrixes. As such, it is a mistake to conceive of an either-\n \n21 \nor choice, or a zero-sum trade off, between the national and the global (S\u00f8rensen, 2003). In \nmany ways globalisation helps to shift and augment national state capacities rather than to \nreduce them to rubble; global flows form part of a complex, intricate, multilayered web of \nsocial, political and economic relations. \nFinally, when thinking through the use of globalisation as an abstract normative \nframe, it is worth recalling its illiberal dimensions. The search for a global demos is not only \nelusive, but when it does succeed, it often takes the form of praise for global uncivil society \nor as opposition to globalisation rather than serving as a harbinger of cosmopolitanism: \nterrorist networks, paedophile rings, racist organisations, transnational criminal gangs and \nfootball hooligans enjoy the capacity to organise and mobilise across borders at least as much \nas Amnesty International, Greenpeace and Jubilee 2000. Indeed, publics around the world \nseem ill-disposed to issues, threats and challenges beyond their immediate borders (Halliday, \n2004). As such, steps towards generating normative, cosmopolitan frames out of the \nabstraction of globalisation rub up fairly quickly against globalisation\u2019s dark, often violent, \nunderbelly.  \n Globalisation, therefore, contains a degree of fuzziness which hinders its utility as an \nanalytical device, as a descriptive term, and as a normative frame. If globalisation is \nglobalisations, if it is rooted in long-term, non-European processes rather than in short-term \nWesternisation, if it is layered onto and infused with other spatio-temporal processes, and if \nthere is relatively little that is truly global about the contemporary world, then perhaps \nglobalisation is not the most adequate frame for our times. At the very least, there are three \nsteps which should be taken if globalisation is to be retained. First, theorists need to be less \nambiguous about what causal properties, if any, globalisation contains, and how these relate \nto modernity\u2019s principal drivers of change. Second, globalisation needs to be defended as a \nbetter descriptive moniker than others available, with more specificity about how the global \n \n22 \ninterlaces with transnational, international, national and local flows. Third, the use of \nglobalisation as a normative frame requires as much attention to its adverse \u2018other side\u2019 as to \nits progressive possibilities. Certainly, there are examples of globalisation being employed to \ngood effect (Albert, 2007). But if the term is to be more widely employed, Fraser and others \nneed to clarify its temporal-spatial field of enquiry, its generative properties and its normative \ncontent. Otherwise, the essential dissonance between the use of globalisation as determinant \nprocess, as historical sociological account of contemporary world politics, and as a site for \nthe re-articulation of cosmopolitan normative frames will remain in place. \n \nDemocracy? \nThe third dimension of Fraser\u2019s frame is the association of a post-Westphalian imaginary, and \nan age of globalisation, with the \u2018co-implication of democracy and justice\u2019 (2005: 88). This \nfusion of democracy and justice into a conjunction of \u2018democratic justice\u2019 draws, at least in \npart, on the work of Ian Shapiro (1999), J\u00fcrgen Habermas (1997) and others in order to argue \nthat \u2018what could once be called the \u201ctheory of social justice\u201d now appears as the \u201ctheory of \ndemocratic justice\u201d\u2019 (2005: 87). Of course, there are a number of sound reasons why Fraser \nand others employ democracy as a foundational element in their thinking. Despite the \ndifficulties associated with mature democracies (Stoker, 2006; Mulgan and Buonfoni, 2006; \nHay, 2007) \u2013 the muting of mainstream politics, the concerns associated with managing \ndifference and freedom (what the novelist Monica Ali calls the \u2018limits of autonomy\u2019) \u2013 \ndemocracy appears to be the best means yet devised of organising political relations. \nDemocracies tend to outperform non-democracies on a range of indices from growth to \nproductivity, and from asset creation to social-welfare indicators such as levels of life \nexpectancy, school enrolment, access to clean drinking water and the like. Democracies also \nseem to be less volatile than non-democracies in terms of economic performance, more \n \n23 \nresponsive to their population\u2019s needs, more adaptable to changing circumstances, and more \ncapable of developing checks and balances on government power which discourage \nirresponsible policies. In terms of economic performance, political representation and levels \nof human development, democracies appear to function better than non-democracies \n(Halperin et al, 2005).  \n However, all too often, commentators take the tangible benefits of actual existing \ndemocracies and conjure them into an intangible ideal-type which obscures several important \npoints: that democracies develop over centuries rather than months; that they take different \nforms according to time and place; that democracy, whatever its benefits, cannot be a panacea \nfor conflict, inequality and poverty; and that democracies require embedding in broader \nsocial and economic relations which are just as slow moving and difficult to manage as the \nprocess of democracy itself. In other words, behind the abstraction of democracy lie thorny \ndetails, details which, in turn, serve as illustrations of the dangers of transforming blueprints \nof what ought to be into the actual world of time, place and history. As such, Fraser\u2019s frame \nof democracy can easily become morphed into support for policies, practices and theoretical \npositions she would not, in general, support, namely democracy promotion and the theory of \nthe democratic peace. In looking briefly at these two issues, some of the weaknesses in \nFraser\u2019s frame become clear. \n Recent attempts by the United States and its allies to promote democracy around the \nworld, by force if necessary, are not as new as they might appear. In fact, democracy \nbuilding, or at least nation-building, has long been a staple of US foreign policy (Robinson, \n1996; Mann, 2003; Pei and Kasper, 2003; Etzioni, 2004). But there is little doubt that the \nneo-conservative movement in Washington has given this long-standing trend fresh impetus. \nIndeed, it is precisely the connection made by neo-conservatives between the moral virtues of \ndemocracy (and the US model in particular), and the reality of US preponderance in the post-\n \n24 \nCold War era which give neo-conservatism both its appeal and its central logic (Williams, \n2005). In other words, an ideologically driven foreign policy, drawn in turn from an \nideologically driven domestic policy (Stelzer, 2004), has seen democracy taken out of its \nparticular historical context and granted an almost metaphysical status. What follows is a \ngrand strategy, perhaps better understood as a revolutionary creed, which seeks to \nsubordinate practice to ideology. To date, the results of this conversion, as with other forms \nof coercive diplomacy (Dragovic-Soso, 2003), have been poor, not a point which seems to \nhave disturbed too many in the White House, even as it has attracted opprobrium from \nopponents both within the United States and around the world. \n Similarly, contemporary advocates of democratic peace theory (DPT) (Doyle, 1983; \nRussett, 1993; Ray, 2003) draw on Immanuel Kant\u2019s three definitive articles for a perpetual \npeace in order to make a simple enough claim: that mature democracies do not go to war with \neach other. Many advocates of DPT go much further than this, supplementing the dyadic \nclaim that democracies are peaceful with respect to one another with both a monadic claim \n(that democratic states are more pacific than non-democratic states) and a triadic claim (that \ndemocracy allied to free trade and cosmopolitian law can generate a world of perpetual \npeace). Some advocates go on to assert that the theory holds not only for wars but also for \nMilitarized Interstate Disputes (MIDs) \u2013 conflicts between states that do not involve full scale \nwar. Democracies are claimed to experience fewer civil conflicts, perform fewer democides \n(the murder of a person or people by a government), are more likely to sign and honour \ninternational agreements, and are more prone to playing by the rules of the international \neconomic order. In its simplicity, and at least to some extent in its empirical purchase, DPT \nhas achieved an impact well beyond the academy. It may be, as one of its proponents, Jack \nLevy (1988: 88) argues, \u2018as close to any empirical law as we have in International Relations \n \n25 \ntoday\u2019, but DPT is also something more than that \u2013 it is that rare breed of an academic idea \nwith wider political significance.  \n The ins and outs of democratic peace theory along with its many difficulties \u2013 over \ndefinition, empirical anomolies, methodology and causal deficiencies \u2013 are both dealt with \nproficiently elsewhere and also beyond the scope of this essay (Layne, 1994; Spiro, 1994; \nBarkawi and Laffey, 1999). Rather, the focus here is on the way in which, by concentrating \non how mature democracies behave, advocates of both DPT and democracy promotion omit a \nneglected, and more important, part of the democracy story \u2013 the propensity of states \nundergoing transitions to democracy to behave unusually aggressively. As a number of \nstudies have shown (Snyder, 2000; Mann, 2004; Mansfield and Snyder, 2005), the path to \ndemocracy is perilous and, all too often, policy makers support a process \u2013 democratisation \u2013 \nwhich is likely to engender domestic conflict and regional instability. Mansfield and Snyder \n(2005), for example, argue that the rush to hold elections in newly democratising states is \nfoolhardly, at least as long as the central mechanisms which guarantee accountability \u2013 an \nindependent judiciary, civilian control of the military, protection for opposition parties, and a \nfree press \u2013 are lacking or only weakly institutionalised. Without domestic checks and \nbalances on their power, populist politicians have a powerful incentive to mobilise support by \nrailing against outsiders (or inside-outsiders) and by threatening neighbouring states. What is \nmore, because democratising states have relatively low levels of infrastructural power, \nincoming elites are often reliant on the military to prop up their regime. Resorting to \nnationalism and xenophobia ensures the insulation of a new regime from its enemies \u2013 both \ninternal and external, real and imagined. \n In this sense, much contemporary work on DPT and democracy promotion misses a \ncrucial point. It is less important to chronicle how mature democracies deliver more pacific, \ntransparent and successful policies for their people than to work on the right sequence, \n \n26 \nprocess and pace by which levels of democratic participation can be raised, a democratic \nculture can be generated, and democratic institutions can be established. The problem is that, \nalthough we know that incomplete, unconsolidated and semi-democratic regimes tend to be \nboth less stable and more war-prone than either full democracies or non-democratic regimes, \nthere is precious little consensus about what the \u2018right order\u2019 of institutions looks like, how \nlong this takes, and indeed on how countries become democratic in the first place. \nDemocratisation is a long-term, gradual and uneven commitment, and democracy is not a \nstatic check-list which can be itemised and fulfilled. Rather it is a process which must be \nconjoined with particular conditions on the ground and which external policies must both \nfeed into and work within. As such, there are limits about what can be achieved \u2013 the short-\nterm time frame of professional politicians runs counter to the long-term time frame which is \nnecessary in order to build stable, fully functioning democracies.  \n The abstraction of democracy from history, time and place made by advocates of \ndemocracy promotion and democratic peace theory, as well as by scholars such as Nancy \nFraser who use democracy as a transcendental frame by which to approach issues of \nrepresentation, illustrates the perils \u2013 both in terms of academic enquiry and political activity \n\u2013 of using universal frames in order to guide research and policy making. Democracy \u2013 once \nremoved from its historical, temporal and spatial contexts \u2013 becomes a meta-doxa, a category \nexisting outside, beyond and on top of history rather than one which is responsive to the \ntwists, turns and quirks of world historical development itself. Indeed, the misapplication of \ndemocracy by Fraser and her unintended associates is inherent in the assumption that static \nsnap-shots can ever capture with sufficient rigour, depth and nuance, the reality of complex \ndynamics. Such schemas represent an attempt to impose order on a world in motion and to fix \ncategories with a timeless and spaceless quality which they cannot possess. Such a step is \nhardly surprising \u2013 a world in flux lends itself to attempts at capturing its essence. But in the \n \n27 \nlong-run, discourses of democracy promotion and DPT, along with post-Westphalia, \nglobalisation and other such frames, offer us relatively few insights into a much more \ninteresting and complex pluriverse of experience. By so doing, they divorce theory from \npractice in a way which runs counter to Fraser\u2019s stated goals and, thereby, problematise the \nvery heart of her project.  \n \n \nRealistic utopias \n \nThis attempt to interrogate the historical background which undergirds Fraser\u2019s normative \nframes is not intended to probe at minor points of detail. Rather, it suggests that the \nfoundations upon which Fraser\u2019s normative constructions are built are insufficient for \nexplaining core dimensions of either the current period or its future possibilities. An \nalternative story of the contemporary era would start with an exercise in historical \nlandscaping in which the current conjuncture becomes part of a much longer narrative of \ncontestation. It is difficult to adopt an appropriate sobriquet for this epoch \u2013 after all it is \nprecisely its openness and uncertainty which provokes such a variety of discursive practices. \nPerhaps the best we can conjure is the rather uninformative, unsatisfactory and unoriginal \nlabel: the post-Cold War era. At least this epithet makes clear the central disjuncture between \nthe current period and the post-World War II era \u2013 the opening of the international order to a \nrange of issues and challenges which had previously been submerged within the empirical \nand normative framework of the Cold War. Whether the current period, in turn, can be \nunderstood as unipolar or multipolar, imperial or heteronomous need not occupy us here. \nWhat is more significant is understanding the openness of the international order within a \nlonger-term, variegated set of processes representing the uneven and yet combined sweep of \n \n28 \nworld history (Rosenberg, 2006). In other words, what is needed is exactly what Fraser \nsuggests: a diagnosis of our abnormal times which places them within a broader context of \nworld historical development, which is rooted in the institutional basis of world politics, but \nwhich manages to retain a critical distance from it. As Fraser notes, such an exercise carries \nwith it significant tension: abstraction and remoteness on the one hand; myopia and \nbureaucratic narcissism on the other. As such, this section attempts a difficult task: to keep \nboth realism and utopianism in view, avoiding the subordination of one to the other while \npreserving the integrity of both. \n It might be fruitful to begin by pointing out some similarities between the current era \nand another period which featured a comparable level of openness \u2013 the inter-war years. \nTowards the end of this period, Edward Hallett (E.H.) Carr, the British journalist, historian \nand policy maker, published The Twenty Years Crisis, a critical interrogation of the build up \nto war and, in particular, an investigation into how utopian dreams of progress, prosperity and \npeace had helped to produce, and then become derailed by, the impending global \nconflagration. Carr\u2019s ire rested principally on the divorce he thought many academics and \ncommentators had produced between practice and ethics, analysis and prescription, and fact \nand value. In particular, Carr\u2019s indignation centred on the tendency of liberal internationalists \n(his \u2018utopians\u2019) to apply, seemingly without sufficient contextualisation, universal principles \nto ill-suited circumstances. As such, concepts such as the harmony of interests, national self-\ndetermination and idle commitments to a \u2018United States of Europe\u2019 merely worked to \nmaintain existing power inequalities and to heighten international instability. Without \nunderstanding the importance of history, time and place, and recognising that universal \nprinciples must be tailored to meeting these contexts, Carr warned of counter-productive \nmessianism masquerading as benevolent self-interest. As he put it, \u2018utopia and reality are the \n \n29 \ntwo facets of political science. Sound political thought and sound political life will be found \nonly where both have their place\u2019 (Carr, 2000: 10).  \n How useful and, indeed, how accurate was Carr\u2019s reading of the inter-war years? It is \ntrue, as Carr claims, that this was a time of absolutes \u2013 of belief in the benevolence of the free \nmarket (at least until the depression), of the necessary good of national self-determination (at \nleast until Hitler started swallowing the smaller states of Central Europe), and of a general \nsense of hedonistic fulfilment, triumph and progress (at least until the spectre of war closed \nin), albeit also a period which was interrupted by what most commentators assumed to be the \nshort-lived lunacy of the Bolshevik revolution, and the rise of authoritarianism from both left \nand right. There are a number of other suggestive comparisons which stem from Carr\u2019s \ninvestigation of the period \u2013 his critique was founded on claims of universality without due \nrecognition for time and place, and on a tendency to remove context and history from \npolitical thinking and action, striking parallels with the one-size-fits-all discourse of \ndemocracy promotion, the idea of the delivery of peace through unfettered markets, or the \nManichean \u2018with us or against us\u2019 binary proposed by both sides of the war on terror. Carr \ncritiqued those who failed to see that Hitler and Nazism were new actors on the international \nstage and, therefore, not easily mapable in the same way as past revisionists, perhaps like \nJihadism today. And intriguingly, one of Carr\u2019s favourite targets was Woodrow Wilson, \ninteresting because today\u2019s neocons are often called, and with good reason, \u2018hard Wilsonians\u2019 \n(Boot, 2002). \n However, it is important not to overstretch these suggestive, broad similarities beyond \nbreaking point \u2013 there is much in Twenty Years that is inaccurate and irrelevant to our \ndiscussion.4 Carr himself called the book \u2018a period piece\u2019, and it is not worth sidetracking into \na comparison of social statics \u2013 the world changes, as do its principal relations. But what is \nworth salvaging from Carr\u2019s work, beyond the broad thrust of his critique, is the construct \n \n30 \nCarr generated to help provide an alternative to the timeless and spaceless ambitions of the \nutopians he critiqued \u2013 that of \u2018realistic utopias\u2019. This construct has, of course, been used \n(and abused) by many others, not least the liberal political theorist John Rawls (1999).5 But \nwhat is especially noteworthy about Carr\u2019s construct is that it was written in a time of intense \nchange as a way of illuminating shifts in the underlying grammar of international politics, \nand as a means of protecting what Carr saw as the essential goal of progressive, or as he saw \nit, peaceful change. As such, it is a construct rooted in the broad political and normative goals \nof cosmopolitan thinking, but one which builds from history and actually existing conditions \nrather than seeking to develop a blueprint of a new social order ex nihilo. Perhaps we might \ncall such an approach \u2018cosmo-history\u2019 so as to emphasise its dual roots in both cosmopolitan \nprinciples and close historical scrutiny.  \n So what does Carr\u2019s construct mean? On the one hand, Carr meant the reality of time, \nplace, history and power, of the world as it was rather than as it might be. Although Carr \noften exaggerated the views of his opponents (Wilson, 2000, 2001), what is worth stressing is \nthe importance, indeed the necessity, Carr placed on recognising existing constraints on \npolitical action, principally those which were institutional and historical in content. \nOtherwise, Carr argued, even the most well-meaning of visions had the propensity to do \nharm, to steamroller differences, and to impose a monochrome reading on a technicolour \nworld. Equally, though, Carr knew that it would neither be possible nor desirable to give up \non utopian thinking per se. The search for something better, a sense of hope, fantasy and \nimagination, is fundamental both to human history and to progressive politics (Harvey 2003; \nJacoby 2005; Jameson 2004, 2005). As Oscar Wilde put it (1891\/2001, 24), \u2018a map of the \nworld that does not include Utopia is not even worth glancing at, for it leaves out the one \ncountry at which humanity is always landing\u2019. But in order to perform the twin functions of \nutopias \u2013 to hold up a critical mirror to society and to imagine a novel institutional order \n \n31 \nwhich recasts social, political and economic relations \u2013 two conditions need to be met: first, \nthat the mirror is not distorted; and second, that such visions recognise their own limits. As \nCarr understood it, while discriminating towards realism meant affirming the status quo and \nover-emphasising technocratic, bureaucratic approaches to problem solving, an over-\nemphasis on utopianism was potentially just as dangerous \u2013 either silencing specificities \nwhich did not conform to type or potentially leading to the type of tyranny which was the \nresult of many utopian dreams, not least revolutionary movements, in the past (Halliday, \n1999; Lawson, 2005b). \n Carr\u2019s answer to this riddle was what he called \u2018a constant conversation\u2019 between \nrealism and utopia, a dialectical relationship between the first best world of speaking to \ntruth(s) and the second best world of political action, in other words an unending dialogue \nbetween intellectual imagination and political prudence. By providing a firmer historical \ngrounding to normative frames, Carr thought, it would become possible to generate realistic \nutopias which interrelated what might be possible, ideally, with what was plausible, \nsubstantively. The construct of \u2018democratisation-lite\u2019 offers one example of how Carr\u2019s idea \nmight apply in contemporary world politics. This frame could originate in three \ncomplementary anchorages: first, that democracy is the best means of organising domestic \nrelations; second, that democratisation is a long-term commitment, with uneven \nconsequences, and which must be rooted in local conditions, histories and contexts; third, that \nattempts to aid democratisation should be limited to economic, political and social policies \nwhich recognise the restrictions that external forces face in aiding peaceful, democratic \nchange. Practical prescriptions that flow from such a position would be relatively small-scale: \nthe raising of levels of education and development standards in order to facilitate the most \nappropriate conditions for the institutionalisation of democracy; the further expansion of \nnetworks which support nascent movements for democratisation; the strengthening of good \n \n32 \ngovernance and state capacity which can sustain a democratic society as well as a democratic \npolity. Such a frame would see democracy less as something to be manufactured out of some \nkind of supra-sensible Platonic form than a process which is limited, long-term and humble. \nConjoined with this set of policy recommendations, this frame would be in keeping with \nCarr\u2019s aim of fostering peaceful change which was at once both normatively framed and \nplausibly deliverable. As such, it offers a viable example of Carr\u2019s notion of realistic utopia, \none with potentially significant consequences for contemporary world politics.  \n \n \nOf possibility and practice \n \nThis article has argued that the framework employed by Nancy Fraser, like that of many \ncontemporary cosmopolitans, rests on faulty historical articulations. The \u2018indefinite ideal\u2019 \npromoted by Fraser is haunted by alternative historical readings, exclusions which less affirm \nher utopia than demonstrate its foreclosure. Fraser\u2019s symbolic order serves to iron out \nmultilinear historical trajectories and to conceal intricacies of time and place. As such, Fraser \nfetishizes free-floating signifiers that lack the remainders, externalities, surpluses, \ncontingencies and disruptions which are central features of world history beyond her \nimmediate zone of reference. In so doing, Fraser finds herself armed with empty signifiers \nwhich are abstracted from historical events and processes, with the result that they can be put \nto use by supporters of theories and practices she would most likely abhor (not least that of \nforceful democracy promotion) and which run counter to forms of political contestation she \nwould most likely support (such as the Third World defence of sovereignty in the face of \neconomic inequality and geopolitical bellicosity). As such, Fraser\u2019s discursive field is a \nvehicle for political sentiment elevated because of our \u2018abnormal times\u2019 into a utopian \n \n33 \nschema which sits alongside, albeit unintentionally, the ill-starred prescriptions of \nneoconservatives and neoliberals alike.  \n This essay has posited an alternative frame for articulating progressive praxis, that of \n\u2018realistic utopias\u2019. In practice, this construct calls for renewed attention to what I have \ndescribed elsewhere as \u2018research with adjectives\u2019 (Lawson, 2006, 2007): the promotion of \nmiddle-range theory in which general abstractions (such as democracy, state and empire) are \nconjoined with additional explanatory signifiers (mature vs. developing democracy; market \nvs. competition state; formal vs. informal empire), in order to provide a more nuanced \nunderstanding of the relationship between conceptual abstractions, normative frames and \nempirical reality. Examples include exploration of how the general structural conditions of \nthe Cold War played out in regional contexts (Halliday, 2005), of how time and space \ndifferentiation impacts on general abstractions such as empire (Lieven, 2001), and at how \nexperiences of globalisation engender complex amalgams of denationalization and \nrenationalization (Sassen, 2006). This method, relatively commonplace in sub-fields such as \nhistorical sociology and comparative politics, follows the pioneering work carried out by the \nItalian political scientist, Giovanni Sartori (1970) in making the case for social and political \ntheory which works both up and down a \u2018ladder of abstraction\u2019 in order to test whether theory \nfits both with general concepts and with the available empirical material. For Sartori, this \nprocess of \u2018conceptual travelling\u2019 generated \u2018fact-storing containers\u2019 geared at unravelling the \ninterplay between homogeneity and heterogeneity, and which combined explanatory purchase \nwith a high degree of empirical content. Such a method seems well suited to our abnormal \ntimes in which commentators, students and analysts are often attracted to proselytising \nvisions from on high rather than knowledge built up from a deep immersion in history and \npractice. \n \n34 \n The central message of this paper is that researchers involved in mapping the \nuncertain landscape of contemporary world politics need to understand the limits of their \nvisions, while also retaining an interest in, and not being afraid of, engaging in normative \njudgements about future possibilities. To be clear, this does not mean a resignation to the \nimmanence of power, nor a failure to act radically in the face of extreme threats, whether \nthese be despotism, terrorism or environmental change. Rather, it means understanding that \nprogressive politics can only start from recognition of the complexity of the contemporary era \nand the multiple histories which lie behind its scaffolding. In short, normative frames of \njustice cannot be removed from the \u2018actually existing\u2019 substance of justice. Much of the time, \nideal theory is constrained by the narrow horizons within which most people operate. But \nduring \u2018abnormal\u2019 periods such as the present conjuncture, the role played by ideas of \n\u2018possible futures\u2019 holds an unusual grip over hearts and minds. These periods are like signal \npoints on a broader track, Weberian switchmen offering tantalizing glimpses of how social, \npolitical and economic orders can be recast. But for all our interesting times and glimpses of \npossible futures, we must remember that the world is imperfect, that there is no tabula rasa \nand no year zero from which to begin again. As such, cosmopolitan thinking must be sure to \nretain its roots in the institutional architecture provided by world history and contemporary \ninternational politics.

My thanks \nto participants at both these events and, in particular, to Kate Nash, Gonzalo Pozo-Martin, \nBren Romney, Kirsten Ainley, Kim Hutchings, John Sidel, Jim Martin, John Hobson, Justin \nRosenberg and two anonymous reviewers for valuable comments on earlier drafts.    \n2 My thanks to Bren Romney for making this point to me. \n3 Certainly each of these states has an imperial past and contains a major secessionist \nmovement within its borders, begging the question, when does an empire become a nation-\nstate? \n4 Although Carr\u2019s book was met with invectives from numerous prominent liberal writers and \npoliticians including Leonard Woolf, David Davies and Alfred Zimmern, in many ways, his \nreputation as a political realist was the result of a disinformation campaign originating in a \nspecious review of Twenty Years written by Hans Morgenthau, doyen of the post-War \nAmerican IR realist community. But Carr only has himself to blame \u2013 his ad hominem attacks \non leading liberal internationalists left him open to such blowback. For more on the fall out \nfrom Twenty Years, Carr\u2019s subsequent denunciation and his more recent rehabilitation, see \nWilson (2000, 2001), and the various contributions to Cox (2000). \n5 Rawls\u2019s theory of justice was, he argued, an example of a realistic utopia in that it went \nbeyond existing social arrangements, but did not contravene human nature. I would rather not \nget bogged down into a discussion about either human nature or Rawls \u2013 there are others \neminently more qualified that I to comment further on this (for example Brown, 2002; Beitz, \n2000; Pogge, 2002). But one point is worth making in passing \u2013 Ken Booth (1991), an IR \ntheorist of some renown, has also written on Carr\u2019s construct, but described it as \u2018utopian \nrealism\u2019. In this article, I subvert the order of these words, and move beyond Booth\u2019s \napplication of utopian realism to the field of critical security studies.  \n"}
