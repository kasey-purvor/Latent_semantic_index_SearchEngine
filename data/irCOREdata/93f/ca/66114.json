REVIEW OF THE PUZZLE\nIn the AdS5 \u0001 S5 supergravity dual of N \u0002 4 super\nYang Mills (SYM) we have three distinct types of configu-\nrations which correspond to a boundary state with large R\ncharge. One is a graviton circling the \u2018\u2018equator\u2019\u2019 of the S5,\nthe second is a graviton polarized [1] into D3 branes\nwrapping an S3 \u0003 S5 (the giant graviton or sphere giant\ngraviton) [2], and the third is a graviton polarized into D3\nbranes wrapping an S3 \u0003 AdS5 (the dual giant graviton or\nAdS giant graviton.) [3\u20135]\nThe field theory interpretation of these states is an\ninteresting issue. The original puzzle was that single-trace\nchiral primary operators in the field theory with R-charge\nL should be dual to single particle states with angular\nmomentum L on the S5. The natural candidate for these\nstates is the graviton. However, at finite N, there is a cutoff\nin the field theory since there are no independent single-\ntrace operators with L > N, yet there is no obvious upper\nbound on the angular momentum of the graviton. The\npredicted upper bound was thought to be due to stringy\neffects and dubbed the \u2018\u2018stringy exclusion principle\u2019\u2019 [2].\nInstead, the resolution turned out to be an IR effect where\nthe gravity dual was identified as the giant graviton. The\nsize of the S3 which the brane wraps grows with the angular\nmomentum until the upper bound of L \u0002 N is reached\nwhere the radius of the S3 reaches the radius of the S5.\nUnfortunately there are two problems with the above\npicture. The first is essentially a technical point\u2014for L of\norder N2=3 the single-trace operators are no longer orthogo-\nnal (even at large N). However, this does not affect the\nargument since the correct operators are subdeterminant\noperators [6] which are also cut off at L \u0002 N. The second\npoint, which we address in this paper, is that there is not\nonly the question of whether the extended giant gravitons\nshould be preferred over the pointlike gravitons but that the\nextended AdS giant gravitons also carry the same quantum\nnumbers, appear to have similar properties to the giant\ngravitons, but crucially have no upper limit on L since\nthe sphere they wrap can be arbitrarily large within the AdS\nspacetime. So, clearly the giant graviton is the one which\nshould correspond to the field theory state, but how do we\nrule out the other two states?\nThe presence of these two extra states has long been a\npuzzle, and different arguments have been made about\ntheir fate. One possible explanation is that they correspond\nto two short multiplets which combine to form a long\nmultiplet, whose dimension is no longer protected [3].\nHowever, as we will see, this is not what seems to happen.\nThe existence of many bulk states with polarized branes\ndual to only one boundary state is highly reminiscent of a\nsimilar problem in gauge-gravity dualities. When one dis-\ncusses the supergravity dual of the N \u0002 1\u0004 theory [7], one\nalso encounters three bulk vacua dual to one gauge theory\nvacuum. As we will review in the first chapter, a generic\nfield theory vacuum can naively have three supergravity\nduals. One candidate dual bulk contains D3 branes polar-\nized into NS5 branes, another one contains D3 branes\npolarized into D5 branes, and the third one has a singularity\nand does not contain any polarized branes.\nFortunately the solution to this puzzle is known [7]. The\nfirst piece of the solution is that the two candidate duals\nwhich contain polarized branes have nonoverlapping\nranges of validity. The second piece of the solution is\nthat the vacuum where the D3 branes are not polarized is\nunphysical. Indeed, in [7] all the N \u0002 1\u0004 vacua (found in\nthe field theory analysis of [8,9]) were mapped to super-\ngravity brane configurations, and there is no field theory\nvacuum which is dual to the bulk vacuum with no polar-\nization. Therefore, that vacuum has too big an action\ncompared to the polarized configurations and does not\ncontribute to the AdS-CFT duality [10].\nThe purpose of this paper is to extend this analysis to\ngiant gravitons and to show that the giant graviton puzzle is\nsolved in an essentially identical way. To do this one needs\nto make a conceptual jump, from regarding the giant\ngravitons as states in the four-dimensional boundary theory\nto regarding them as vacua of an auxiliary theory, which\nlives on L coincident gravitons in this background. This\n*Electronic address: iosif@physics.ucla.edu\n\u2020Electronic address: Douglas.Smith@durham.ac.uk\nPHYSICAL REVIEW D 71, 025005 (2005)\n1550-7998=2005=71(2)=025005(7)$23.00 025005-1 \uf6d9 2005 The American Physical Society\ntheory has been discussed in [11] and was successfully\nused in [12] to give a microscopic description to some of\nthe giant gravitons.1 When the giant gravitons sit in the\n\u2018\u2018near-graviton\u2019\u2019 region, they are indeed dual (by the\nBDHM extension of the AdS-CFT correspondence [13])\nto vacua of this theory.\nIntroducing this auxiliary theory into the puzzle makes\nthe dictionary between the giant gravitons and the CFT\nchiral primaries two-step. One first relates the states of the\nCFT to the vacua of the auxiliary theory, and then relates\nthese vacua to the giant gravitons. Fortunately, each step is\nconceptually rather simple. The dictionary between the\ngauge theory states and the vacua of the auxiliary theory\nis one to one and not hard to guess. As we will see in\nSec. III, this dictionary relates vacua and states of two\ntheories which are both strongly coupled when supergrav-\nity is weakly coupled, and vice versa. Thus the fact that it is\none to one is quite natural.\nThe three to one degeneracy we had in the original\ndictionary is now mapped into a three to one degeneracy\nin the map between a vacuum of the auxiliary theory and its\nthree candidate dual giant graviton configurations.\nFortunately, this problem is almost identical to the one\nsolved in [7].\nThe physics behind the two maps is conceptually rather\nsimple. Like in the N \u0002 1\u0004 case, the unpolarized configu-\nration [the Kaluza Klein (KK) graviton] is unphysical, and\nhas no field theory dual.2 Moreover, a given chiral primary\ncan have two giant graviton duals, which have nonoverlap-\nping ranges of validity. The sphere and AdS giant gravitons\nhave therefore completely different origins. Intuitively,\nthe sphere giant comes from one \u2018\u2018single particle\u2019\u2019 state\nwith angular momentum\/R-charge L (roughly speaking\na single-trace operator of L \t\u2019s), while the AdS giant\ncomes from L single particle states with angular\nmomentum\/R-charge one (an operator with a product of\nL traces of \t.).\nWe also should note that the map we propose matches\nvery well with, and extends the proposal of Corley, Jevicki,\nand Ramgoolam (CJR) [14] for the chiral primaries dual to\nthe AdS and sphere giant gravitons. Although this proposal\ngives a better understanding of the mapping between ex-\ntended objects and field theory operators, it does not solve\nthe giant graviton problem, since an operator represented\nby a rectangular Young tableau of size L\u0001H can corre-\nspond to either L sphere giants of angular momentum H, or\nto H AdS giants of angular momentum L. As we will see,\nour proposal maps this degeneracy to the one encountered\nin N \u0002 1\u0004 theory, and thus resolves this puzzle rather\nnicely.\nIn Sec. II we dualize the geometries sourced by KK\ngravitons in the AdS\u0001 S spacetimes to geometries where\nthe bulk-boundary duality is very well understood. We then\nargue that the solution corresponding to the unpolarized\ngraviton is nonphysical, by using the dual field theory. The\npointlike graviton with angular momentum of order N can\nalso be directly ruled out as a sensible classical solution [2]\nsince it receives large quantum corrections because of its\nvery large energy density. Our T-duality arguments extend\nthis to all pure graviton states in the regime where giant\ngravitons exist.\nIn Sec. III we review the N \u0002 1\u0004 duality (which is the\nprototypical duality between field theories and bulks with\nmany polarized branes) as well as its trivial extension to the\ntheory on a large number of D0 branes. We also present the\none to one map between CFT chiral primaries and vacua of\nthe auxiliary theory, and thus complete our proposal. In the\nAppendix A we explore the ranges of validity of our\nconstruction.\nBefore proceeding we should remark that in the case of\nthe AdS5 \u0001 S5 giant gravitons, the brane configurations\ncorresponding to the two gravitons are very similar.\nTherefore, we will initially concentrate on the AdS4 \u0001 S7\nandAdS7 \u0001 S4 cases, where the distinction between sphere\nand AdS giant gravitons is more clear and then argue that\nthe same picture extends to the AdS5 \u0001 S5 case.3\nII. DUALIZING THE GIANT GRAVITONS\nPerhaps the easiest way to understand the three (giant)\ngraviton states of angular momentum L is to do a T-duality\nalong the momentum of the graviton. The resulting static\nconfiguration consists locally of L F1 strings, in some\ntransverse fields. These F1 strings can appear in three\nincarnations\u2014by themselves and polarized into a D4\nbrane of geometry R1;1 \u0001 S3 where the S3 can sit in either\ngroup of four (picked out by the background flux) of the\neight transverse directions.\nNote that even though the geometry resulting after the T-\nduality is singular at the poles of the sphere, we know that\nstring theory on that background makes sense. The singu-\nlarity of the T-dual supergravity solution comes from the\nfact that winding modes near the origin can shrink to zero\nsize, and thus it is an artifact, signaling the breakdown of\nthe supergravity approximation to string theory. However,\nas we will see in the Appendix A, the auxiliary theory\ndescribes the giant gravitons only in a region near the\nequator. Thus, the breakdown of the supergravity approxi-\nmation happens in a region away from the F1 strings we are\nanalyzing.\nNear the F1 strings, one cannot consider them any more\nas a perturbation on the geometry. They become a source\nfor the geometry. The geometry near the strings is the near-1In this paper we analyze this auxiliary theory only implicitly,\nby relating it via dualities to much better understood theories.\n2This was also argued in the original giant graviton paper [2],\nby estimating the action of the KK graviton and finding it\ndivergent.\n3The AdS3 \u0001 S3 case appears to be very different from the\nother cases [15].\nIOSIF BENA AND DOUGLAS SMITH PHYSICAL REVIEW D 71, 025005 (2005)\n025005-2\nhorizon F1-string geometry perturbed with some trans-\nverse fluxes (coming from the 5-form field strength of\nthe AdS5 \u0001 S5 geometry), which can cause the strings to\nbe polarized into D4 branes. The M-theory lift of this\ngeometry is very reminiscent of the geometry dual to the\nmassive flow of the M2 brane worldvolume theory [16]. In\nfact, it is quite easy to see (using the fact that both geome-\ntries allow brane polarization and that both are supersym-\nmetric) that this M-theory lift is the massive AdS4 \u0001 S7\nflow geometry in which M2 branes in transverse fields\npolarize into M5 branes.\nOne can also examine the M-theory giant gravitons and\nsee that by dimensionally reducing them along their mo-\nmentum they correspond locally to D0 branes polarized\ninto D2 branes and NS5 branes, respectively. This geome-\ntry is also the gravity dual of the field theory on the D0\nbranes perturbed by a chiral multiplet mass. Like in the\nprevious case, the IIA geometry obtained by reducing the\nM-theory giant gravitons along their momentum is singular\nat the poles. However, this only signifies the breakdown of\nthe IIA supergravity approximation, and the background\nmakes perfect sense if one considers the full M-theory. As\nbefore, the physics we are interested in happens in a region\naway from where IIA supergravity breaks down.\nThe theory on the D0 branes is just supersymmetric\nmatrix quantum mechanics. The background fluxes in\nwhich these D0 branes sit are a transverse Neveu-\nSchwarz-Neveu-Schwarz 3-form field strength and a trans-\nverse Ramond-Ramond 6-form field strength. It is not hard\nto see (either by T-dualizing 3 times the Polchinski-\nStrassler setup, or by analyzing the non-Abelian Born\nInfeld action of the D0 branes) that the effect of these\nfluxes on the D0 branes is to induce a mass for three of\nthe chiral multiplets of the supersymmetric matrix quan-\ntum mechanics. The supergravity dual of the perturbed\ntheory has now many vacua, which contain polarized\nbranes. The structure of these vacua is identical for any\nDp branes put in a transverse H3 and F6\u0005p. The D3 brane\ncase has been analyzed in [7] and the D2 brane case has\nbeen analyzed in [17].\nIn the next section we review the example of D3 branes\nin transverse H3 and F3. This is the best understood case\nwhere one boundary vacuum naively corresponds to three\nbulk configurations. In that case, the dual field theory\nintuition helps us understand very well how this discrep-\nancy is resolved. We then use the fact that the D0 setup is\nrelated to the D3 setup case by T-duality to argue that this\nresolution extends to the D0 brane case and consequently\nto the giant gravitons.\nA. The map between giant gravitons and vacua\nof the D0 brane theory\nAs we explained in the introduction, in the string theory\ndual of the N \u0002 1\u0004 theory one generically has vacua\ncontaining D3 branes polarized into D5 branes and NS5\nbranes. Brane polarization happens because the D3 branes\nare placed in transverse Ramond-Ramond and Neveu-\nSchwarz-Neveu-Schwarz 3-form fluxes.\nLet us first examine the two vacua corresponding to L\nD3 branes polarized into one D5 brane and one NS5 brane,\nrespectively. The N \u0002 1\u0004 classical F-term constraints are\n\u0006Xi; Xj\u0007 \u0002 \u000eijkXk. The D5 vacuum corresponds to the\nmaximally Higgsed classical solution, where the Xi are\nthe generators of the L\u0001 L irreducible representation of\nSU(2). The NS5 vacuum corresponds to the classical so-\nlution Xi \u0002 0\u0001 11. Thus the Xi can be thought of as the\ngenerators of the product of L trivial representations of\nSU(2). Quantum effects make this state acquire a nonzero\nhX2i, which can be interpreted in supergravity as the D3\nbranes polarizing into an NS5 brane. In [7] it was shown\nthat this polarization is caused by nonperturbative ef-\nfects\u2014indeed, the presence of NS5 branes in the bulk\ncorresponds to confinement in the field theory, and the\nsize of the NS5 branes gives the field theory mass gap.\nAs we can see, the two single-brane states come from\ncompletely different classical states. This phenomenon is\ngeneric to all polarizations of D branes. The polarization\npattern is Dp! D\u000bp\f 2\r and Dp! NS5. The Dp!\nD\u000bp\f 2\r configuration corresponds in the classical limit\nto the L\u0001 L irreducible representation of SU(2). The\nDp! NS5 configuration is made of L classical objects\n(corresponding to a product of N trivial representations)\nwhich via nonperturbative quantum effects create one NS5\nbrane.\nOnce we have established this correspondence, we can\ngo ahead and analyze a more general classical configura-\ntion, and see what it corresponds to in the supergravity\ndual. The various duality relations are sketched in Fig. 1.\nFor example, a classical configuration in which the Xi\nare the generators of the product of L=k SU(2) irreducible\nrepresentations of dimension k corresponds in the bulk to\npolarization into k D5 branes. However, this configuration\ncould also correspond to polarization into L=k NS5 branes.\nWhat solves this apparent puzzle is the fact that the two\nconfigurations have nonoverlapping ranges of validity [7].\nThus, for k2 \u000e Lg the dual bulk configuration has NS5\nbranes, while for k2 \u000f Lg the dual bulk configuration has\nD5 branes.4. This gives a one to one map between classical\nStates in the \non D0 branes\nVacua of theory\non the gravitons\nVacua of theory Giant Gravitons\nAdS \u2212 CFT\nAdS \u2212 CFT\nPolarized branes\nD0 \u2212> D2\nD0 \u2212> NS5\nExplicit\nImplicit\nDictionary\nDictionary\nboundary CFT\nduality duality\nFIG. 1.

It\nis quite likely that this configuration has a naked singular-\nity, and thus it has too large an action to contribute in the\nAdS-CFT correspondence. The fact that the bulk and\nboundary analysis of the vacua of the N \u0002 1\u0004 theory\nmatch so precisely, and that there is no boundary vacuum\ndual to this geometry is a very strong argument that this\nstate indeed does not appear in the AdS-CFT correspon-\ndence. This shows that KK graviton is probably singular\nwhen a giant graviton with the same angular momentum\nexists. When this giant graviton is smaller than the string\nscale, the KK graviton is physical.\nThe N \u0002 1\u0004 classical analysis of the vacua extends\ntrivially to the D0 brane case.5 Thus, the maximally\nHiggsed irreducible representation corresponds to the D0\nbranes becoming one D2 brane, and the product of L trivial\nrepresentations corresponds to the D0 branes polarizing\ninto one NS5 brane. These two configurations are the\nreduction of the biggest M-theory sphere and AdS giant\ngravitons. A product representation can again be inter-\npreted as the dual of k giants or L=k AdS giants, depending\non k and the coupling constant.\nThus, we have a very clear one to one map between giant\ngraviton configurations and vacua of the auxiliary gauge\ntheory on the D0 branes. The map is naively three to one,\nbut we have seen that the configuration with no polariza-\ntion (dual to the KK graviton) is excluded, and the two\nconfigurations dual to the same gauge theory vacuum have\nnonoverlapping ranges of validity.\nIII. THE ONE TO ONE MAP\nThe auxiliary theory description presented in the pre-\nvious section allows one to think about theD0! NS5 state\nas corresponding classically to L particles of angular mo-\nmentum one, which form a bound state because of quan-\ntum effects. In a similar way, the D0! D2 state would\ncorrespond classically to one state of angular momentum\nL.\nThis picture is furthermore supported by the fact that the\nstate with L=k AdS giants and the state with k sphere giants\ncorrespond to the same auxiliary theory configuration.\nTherefore, k giant gravitons of one kind correspond to k\nstates each containing L=k particles, while k giant grav-\nitons of the other kind correspond to L=k states each\ncontaining k particles. Hence, only one of the maximal\ngiant gravitons found in supergravity corresponds to a\ngauge theory single particle state, while the other describes\na \u2018\u2018multiparticle\u2019\u2019 state.\nTo summarize, the main lesson we can draw from the\nauxiliary theory description of the M-theory giant gravi-\ntons is that k sphere giants of angular momentum L=k\ncorrespond to the same boundary configuration as L=k\ndual giants of angular momentum k but in a different\nregime of the parameter space. This indicates that the\nmaximal sphere and maximal AdS giants correspond to\nclassical configurations that roughly speaking can be\nthought of as single particle and multiparticle states. We\nwould like now to use this intuition to discuss the AdS5 \u0001\nS5 giant gravitons.\nAs we show in the Appendix , the auxiliary map of\nSec. II does not extend to the case when the R charge is\ncomparable to N, basically because the giant gravitons\nbecome bigger than the near-horizon region they source,\nand are thus not described any more by the auxiliary\ntheory. However, we do not believe this affects the picture\nabove. It would be rather strange if the fact that two\ndifferent giant gravitons correspond to the same boundary\nstate changed, especially in the AdS5 \u0001 S5 case were one\ncan go out of the near-graviton region (A7) by changing a\ncontinuous small parameter\u2014gs.\nThrough the usual correspondence, the number of par-\nticles becomes a number of traces in the field theory\noperator, at least for R charge small6 compared to N2=3.\nThus, for small L, a maximal sphere giant should corre-\nspond to a single-trace operator, while the maximal AdS\ngiant should correspond to a chiral primary operator with L\ntraces. Moreover, given a total angular momentum L, k\nsphere giants and L=k AdS giants correspond to the same\nCFT state.\nWe can see that the picture that emerges from our\ndescription matches very well with the proposal of\nCorley, Jevicki, and Ramgoolam for the chiral primaries\ndual to the AdS and sphere giant gravitons [14]. According\nto this proposal, the sphere giant gravitons and AdS giant\ngravitons are both dual to N \u0002 4 SYM chiral primaries of\nR-charge L. An efficient method to index the chiral pri-\nmaries of this field theory is to associate to each primary a\nU\u000bN\r Young Tableau. For L\u000f N the number of traces in\neach operator corresponds to the number of columns of the\nYoung tableau, and the number of fields in each trace\ncorresponds to the number of boxes in the corresponding\ncolumn. For larger L mixing becomes important, and the\ndictionary becomes more involved [6]. The total number of\nboxes in the Young tableau gives the R-charge L of the\noperator, which maps to the total angular momentum of the\ndual supergravity state.\nNow the proposal in [14] was that a single column of L\nboxes, i.e., the totally antisymmetric rank L representation,\ncorresponds to the operator dual to a single sphere giant\n5The only difference is that for D0 branes there are no oblique\nstates, and therefore vacua do not proliferate as one goes from\nclassical to quantum.\n6When the R charge becomes comparable to N2=3, this picture\nstarts getting corrected [6]\u2014 the single traces become\nsubdeterminants.\nIOSIF BENA AND DOUGLAS SMITH PHYSICAL REVIEW D 71, 025005 (2005)\n025005-4\ngraviton with angular momentum L. Clearly these states fit\nin with the \u2018\u2018stringy exclusion principle\u2019\u2019 as they are both\ncut off at L \u0002 N. Several columns of equal length would\ncorrespond to several giant gravitons (or a single multiply\nwrapped giant graviton). Similarly, a single row of L\nboxes, i.e., the totally symmetric rank L representation,\nwas proposed to be dual to a single AdS giant graviton with\nangular momentum L. For small L the corresponding field\ntheory operator contains a product of L single traces.7 This\nconfirms the heuristic picture of the dual giant as a bound\nstate of L particles with angular momentum 1, which\nemerged from the auxiliary theory.\nBy combining the auxiliary theory description of giant\ngravitons with the CJR proposal, one can formulate a map\nbetween field theory operators and auxiliary theory vacua,\nwhich naturally extends this proposal. Thus, a CFT opera-\ntor described by a Young tableau with k columns of lengths\nLi corresponds to the same giant graviton configuration as\na classical vacuum of the auxiliary theory in which the\nscalars are in the SU(2) representation which is the product\nof k irreducible representations of size Li \u0001 Li. The num-\nber of boxes of the Young tableau is the total angular\nmomentum of the giant graviton, which in the auxiliary\ntheory gives the rank of the gauge group and is equal to the\nsum of the Li\u2019s. The completely vertical Young tableau is\nlinked by this map to the maximally Higgsed vacuum,\nwhich corresponds to the D0\u2013D2 polarization channel.\nThe completely horizontal Young tableau is linked to the\nproduct of L trivial representations, which corresponds to\nthe D0\u2013NS5 polarization.\nThe CJR proposal, although giving a better understand-\ning of the mapping between giant gravitons and chiral\nprimaries, still does not solve the giant graviton problem,\nsince an operator represented by a rectangular Young\ntableau of size L\u0001H can correspond to either L sphere\ngiants of angular momentum H or to H AdS giants of\nangular momentum L. Our proposed map solves this prob-\nlem very easily by mapping any Young tableau to a clas-\nsical vacuum of the gauge theory on the D0 branes and\nusing the fact that the two supergravity duals of this\nvacuum have nonoverlapping ranges of validity (at least\nfor rectangular Young tableaux\u2014and we propose this is\ntrue in general). So for a given range of parameters there is\nalways only one valid supergravity solution per chiral\nprimary.\nAlthough our map agrees with the CJR proposal for the\nmaximal sphere and AdS giant, it seems to differ a bit for\nless symmetric cases. For example, in [14] a Young tableau\nwith two columns of lengths L1 and L2, such that 0<L2 \u0005\nL1 \u000f L2 was argued to correspond to two giant gravitons\nof momentum L1 and to one KK graviton of momentum\nL2 \u0005 L1. According to our map, this Young tableau should\ncorrespond to two giant gravitons of momenta L1 and L2\nand no free KK gravitons. As we have explained, a KK\ngraviton of momentum L2 \u0005 L1 should be unphysical\nwhen the giant graviton of the same momentum is a valid\nsolution. If L2 \u0005 L1 is very small, and the corresponding\ngiant graviton does not exist, the KK graviton should\ncorrespond to a Young tableau column of length L2 \u0005 L1\n. It would be interesting to see if this could be indepen-\ndently checked.\nWe should remark also that the duals of the sphere giant\ngravitons are different in the case of AdS7 \u0001 S4 and\nAdS4 \u0001 S7. In one case the sphere giant is dual to a D2\nbrane, and in the other to an NS5 brane. Our arguments\nimply that one of the giant gravitons corresponds to the\nsingle particle state and the other one to the many particle\nstate. However, we cannot say which of the two giant\ngravitons is the \u2018\u2018single-trace\u2019\u2019 one, essentially because\nthe dualities used to get to the auxiliary theory description\nare strong-weak dualities, which can cause large mixing\nbetween single-trace and multiple-trace operators [18] (es-\nsentially in the same way in which S-duality in the N \u0002 1\u0004\ntheory interchanges the D5 and the NS5 vacua). The same\ndifficulty persists to the AdS5 \u0001 S5 case, where the AdS\nand sphere giant gravitons have the same brane content.\nOne can also see that it is difficult to distinguish which of\nthe two giant gravitons is the dual of a single particle state\nbecause S-duality maps each brane to itself.\nWhat seems however to be very generic is that when we\nhave two polarization channels, only one channel corre-\nsponds to a single particle state\/single-trace operator, while\nthe other one corresponds to a many particle state\/multi-\ntrace operator. Thus the sphere giant and AdS giant have\ncompletely different field theory duals, despite their simi-\nlarity in supergravity.\nAs we have explained in the previous section, the M-\ntheory lift of the T-dual of the IIB near-graviton geometry\nis the massive flow of the M2 brane theory, which contains\nM2 branes polarized into M5 branes. The sphere and AdS\ngiants correspond to the two orientations of the polariza-\ntion planes.\nAccording to our dictionary, the two duals of a gauge\ntheory Young Tableau of size k\u0001 Lk would be a state with k\nM5 branes of M2 charge L=k each, and a state with L=k\nM5 branes of M2 charge k each. However, it was shown in\n[16] that a state with a total of L M2 branes polarized into k\nM5 branes only has a valid description for\nk2 <L: (1)\nThus, the two duals of the gauge theory state described\nabove have nonoverlapping ranges of validity. We should\nnote that this is a rather nontrivial check for our conjec-\ntured dictionary, given that the bound above comes from\nthe M5 brane action, which does not have many things in\n7The gauge group is taken to be U\u000bN\r in [14] rather than\nSU\u000bN\r. However, on the supergravity side, this difference may\nnot be apparent without considering quantum corrections.\nTOWARDS THE SOLUTION TO THE GIANT GRAVITON PUZZLE PHYSICAL REVIEW D 71, 025005 (2005)\n025005-5\ncommon with chiral primaries of four-dimensional N \u0002 4\nsuper Yang Mills.\nWe should remark that the argument we give above,\nmuch like the arguments given in other \u2018\u2018Polchinski-\nStrassler\u2019\u2019-like setups [7,16], does not \u2018\u2018prove\u2019\u2019 that the\nvacuum degeneracy problem is solved. These papers pro-\npose a solution to the vacuum degeneracy problem in the\nN \u0002 1\u0004 theory and show that the most obvious way to\nimplement the proposal (by constructing two bulk vacua\ndual to the same boundary vacuum) does not work.\nHowever, the whole method of constructing these kinds\nof configurations is rather intricate, and therefore it is\nlegitimate to ask whether the fact that one cannot construct\ntwo bulk vacua per boundary vacuum is strong evidence\nfor a solution to vacuum degeneracy, or merely a reflection\nof the limitations of the technology in [7,16]. The only\nmethod to prove that vacuum degeneracy does not exist is\nto construct the full Polchinski-Strassler supergravity so-\nlutions and to observe the transition from one bulk vacuum\nto the other as one changes the parameters of the boundary\ntheory. This has been done in two papers that appeared\nafter this paper was posted on the arxiv\u2014[19,20]\u2014where\nit was found that all M2\u2013M5 and giant graviton solutions\nare governed by a harmonic function and that the interpre-\ntation of a giant graviton as a wrapped brane breaks down\nas one goes away from the regime of parameters described\nin (1). This confirms the correctness of the solution to the\nvacuum degeneracy problem that we propose.\nAnother prediction of our map is that there is an upper\nbound on the total number of AdS giants. Indeed, the\nnumber of AdS giants and the angular momentum of the\nsphere giants have the same auxiliary theory interpretation,\nand thus both should be cut off at N. To see that this is the\ncase we recall that the AdS giant is a spherical brane\ndomain wall in AdS, and therefore the flux which supports\nthe AdS\u0001 S geometry jumps across the brane. Let us now\nimagine having exactly N AdS giant gravitons. The flux\ninside this configuration is zero, and so if one tries to form\nanother AdS giant graviton there is no flux to support it\nfrom collapsing. If there are more than N AdS giants, the\nflux in the region inside them changes sign, and pulls down\nsome of the AdS giants, reducing the number below N.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have examined the expansion of pointlike gravitons\ninto giant gravitons, and have argued that when giant\ngravitons exist, the pointlike gravitons have no field theory\ndual. Most probably they are not valid solutions of super-\ngravity. Moreover, we have argued by analogy to the study\nof the N \u0002 1\u0004 theory by Polchinski and Strassler [7] that\nthe two different types of giant graviton have distinct\ninterpretations in the field theory.\nIn the supergravity description the giant graviton and\ndual giant graviton appear to be similar objects, arising\nfrom the coupling of the pointlike graviton to a background\nfield, either electrically or magnetically. However, we have\npresented arguments that only one of these two expanded\nconfigurations corresponds classically to a single particle\/\nsingle-trace state, while the other one corresponds classi-\ncally to many particles, which form a bound state via\nquantum effects. This interpretation also ties in nicely\nwith the map between giant gravitons and field theory\noperators via Young tableaux [14].\nMoreover, we have shown that a collection of L=k AdS\ngiants with angular momentum k and a collection of k\nsphere giants with angular momentum L=k correspond to\nthe auxiliary theory vacuum, and hence to the same CFT\nchiral primary, but in different regimes of parameters. We\nhave thus presented a solution to the problem that there are\napparently many more configurations involving giant and\ndual giant gravitons than there are appropriate dual field\ntheory operators.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe would like to thank Allan Adams, Ofer Aharony,\nDan Kabat, Per Kraus, Don Marolf, Joe Polchinski, Radu\nRoiban, and Simon Ross for stimulating discussions.

In order for this\nto happen, the size rg of a giant graviton of momentum L\nmust be smaller than the size of the near-horizon region of\nthe gravitons r0. Moreover, when the size of the giant\ngraviton becomes smaller than the string or Planck scale,\nit makes sense to treat it as a KK graviton.\nTo estimate r0 we use the fact that in ten dimensions, the\nharmonic function sourced by L gravitons is of the form\nZ\u0005 1\u0010\nL\nR g\n2\ns\nr6\n\u0002 r\n6\n0\nr6\n; (A1)\nwhile in eleven-dimensional supergravity the harmonic\nfunction is\nZ\u0005 1\u0010\nL\nR\nr7\n\u0002 r\n7\n0\nr7\n: (A2)\nThe total energy in the gravitons is LR , and the extra factor\nof g2 in (A1) comes from using string units instead of\nPlanck units.\nFor AdS7 \u0001 S4, size of the near-graviton region is (A2)\nr70 \u0010\nL\nR\n\u0010 L\nN1=3\n; (A3)\nwhile the size of a giant graviton of angular momentum Li\nis [2]\nIOSIF BENA AND DOUGLAS SMITH PHYSICAL REVIEW D 71, 025005 (2005)\n025005-6\nrg \u0002 LiRN \u0010\nLi\nN2=3\n: (A4)\nTherefore, a state containing a single giant graviton is\ndescribed by the auxiliary theory for L < N13=18.\nMoreover, the requirement that the size of the giant gravi-\nton be bigger than the Plank length gives a lower bound on\nLi: Li > N2=3. If we have more giant gravitons, the near-\ngraviton region increases, while the size of the giants\nremains the same, so the range described by the auxiliary\ntheory increases.\nFor AdS5 \u0001 S5, the size of the near-graviton region is\n(A1)\nr60 \u0010\nLg2s\nR\n; (A5)\nwhere R4 \u0010 gsN. The size of the giant graviton of angular\nmomentum Li is [2]\nr2g \u0002 LiR\n2\nN\n: (A6)\nTherefore, a state containing a single giant graviton is\ndescribed by the auxiliary theory for\nL2 <NR=ls \u0010 N5=4g1=4s : (A7)\nThe requirement that the size of the giant graviton be\nbigger than the string length gives the lower bound:\nL2 >Ng\u00051s .\nFor AdS4 \u0001 S7, the horizon size is (A2)\nr70 \u0010\nL\nR\n\u0010 L\nN1=6\n; (A8)\nwhile the size of a giant graviton is [2]\nr4g \u0002 LiR\n4\nN\n\u0010 Li\nN1=3\n: (A9)\nTherefore, a state with one giant graviton is described by\nthe auxiliary theory for L < N5=9. The lower bound on L is\nL> N1=3.\nWe should note that the window of parameters in which\ngiant gravitons are described by the auxiliary theory grows\nwith N. Moreover, the window can be made larger if one\nconsiders states with many giant gravitons. This window\ncovers but a fraction of the available parameter space.\nHowever, as we have explained in Sec. III the basic physics\nwhich the auxiliary theory analysis reveals remains valid\nthroughout the whole parameter space.\n[1] R. C. Myers, J. High Energy Phys. 12 (1999) 022.\n[2] J. McGreevy, L.
