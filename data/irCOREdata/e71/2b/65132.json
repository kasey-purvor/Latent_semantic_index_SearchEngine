The \nideal of collaboration is fully realizable in this setting, where the participants are both \neager and qualified to contribute meaningfully to the project. However, the fulfilment \nof such an ideal poses its own problems. For example, the educational level and \nprofessional expertise of participants allows them to fully engage with the theoretical \nframework to the extent that they could, if allowed, rewrite manuscripts. Other issues \nare more subtle, such as how to establish appropriate boundaries between the \nresearcher and the tobacco control office staff and their perspectives. We suggest that \ncollaborative research presupposes differentials of power, education and culture that \ndo not necessarily apply in the case of research with health policy-makers in such \nsettings. The challenge is to maintain a balance between collaboration and research \nespecially when there are no power differentials between the researchers and \nparticipants but there are power differentials between the participants. \n \nKeywords: Tobacco control, public health policy, collaboration, ethnography, \nEngland  \n  \n2 \nConfronting collaboration: dilemmas in an ethnographic study of \nhealth policy-makers \n \nIntroduction \nAnthropology as a discipline is beset with image problems. All too often it is \nregarded as insufficiently valuable by those who set the budgets (Basch 1999), and \nthere are widespread accusations that anthropological research only further entrenches \nthe power imbalances that have caused some of the problems anthropologists study \n(Tierney 2001; West 2005). As a result, there has been a significant shift towards \nwhat is known as collaborative or engaged anthropology, which has gained \nmomentum since the Darkness in El Dorado controversy (Hurtado and Salzano 2004: \n3-4). According to the American Anthropological Association (AAA): \n \n\u201eCollaborative research involves the side-by-side work of all parties in a \nmutually beneficial research program. All parties are equal partners in the \nenterprise, participating in the development of the research design and in other \nmajor aspects of the program as well, working together toward a common \ngoal. Only in the collaborative model is there full give and take, where at \nevery step of the research knowledge and expertise is shared.\u201f (AAA 2002: \n46) \n \nAs a result, methodological and ethical training has been adjusted to support \nand encourage collaborative work, for example in calling for on-going consultation \nwith participants, for results to be fed back in a meaningful manner and for \u201congoing \niterations of data collection, analysis and validation, reflection and re-evaluation\u201d \n(Sillitoe et al. 2005: 85).  Such approaches can be criticized for their uncritical \n  \n3 \nacceptance of collaboration, and their lack of regard to the practical problems that \nmay be inherent in the concept.\n1 \nIn this article we reflect on the process of carrying out collaborative research \nin a study of England\u201fs first tobacco control office, now known as the Smoke Free \nNorth East Office (SFNEO), which was established in May 2005. This research has \nconfronted an assumption implicit assumption in the collaborative paradigm, namely \nthat there are entrenched power, ideological, educational and cultural differences that \nneed to be surmounted. Our account highlights the issues that arise when there are no \nobvious power differentials between researchers and participants. \nThe SFNEO coordinates the activities of Smoke Free North East (SFNE), an \numbrella term for all the tobacco control activities in the North East region of \nEngland. At the time of data collection, SFNE was funded by the 16 North East \nprimary care organisations (later reconfigured to 12), with a further contribution from \nthe Department of Health. It is steered by a broad coalition of public, private and third \nsector partners in the region.\n2\n  After looking at the research project we have \nestablished to evaluate its effectiveness, we chart some of the unanticipated effects of \nthe lack of power differentials in terms of project structure, research methods, outputs \nand who collaborates. \n \nThe Project \nResearch funding was obtained from the National Prevention Research \nInitiative (NPRI), a large consortium of UK research councils and charitable bodies \nset up to advance research into \u201ewhat works\u201f in four key areas (smoking, alcohol, diet \nand exercise) that can help to prevent some of the \u201ebig killer\u201f diseases (including \ncancer, heart disease and diabetes). The majority of proposals funded in the first \n  \n4 \nround, 26 in total, involve randomized controlled trials. Ours was the only \nanthropologically-based multidisciplinary project; co-applicants included a health \ninequalities expert, a health policy analyst, an epidemiologist, and a health economist. \nHowever it fitted both the remit of the NPRI and the call by Wanless (2004) for more \nmicro-level studies of the dynamics of interventional approaches in public health and \nthe analysis of mechanisms whereby these outcomes were reached, rather than a focus \non outcome measures alone.  \nOne of the selection criteria for applications to the NPRI was whether \n\u201cconsumer or patient groups, other beneficiaries of the research or the public in \ngeneral [have been] involved in a consultative manner in the development and\/or \noperation of the study.\u201d The NPRI also called for \u201cmulti-disciplinary collaborations \nfrom the prevention research community\u201d. Thus there was a convenient convergence \nof current trends towards collaborative methods in both anthropological health \nresearch (Lambert and McKevitt 2002) and the selection criteria of the funding body.  \nIn keeping with those concerns, the SFNEO research project was designed in \ncollaboration with key members of SFNE, some of whom were appointed to the \nproject\u201fs steering committee. Moreover, the regular feedback of results was written \ninto the project\u201fs methodology, thereby building into our proposal strong \ncollaborative links, as well as engagement of \u201ethe public\u201f through the provision of \nannual stakeholder events offering the chance both to communicate information about \nthe project and to receive public feedback on it. \n The project commenced in April 2006 for three years. It aimed to describe the \nformation and functioning of the SFNEO and to monitor outcomes in order to study \nits effectiveness. A postdoctoral research associate (Heckler) was employed to run the \nproject, using ethnographic data collection methods such as observation and recording \n  \n5 \nof events, stakeholder interviews, and the collation and analysis of relevant \ndocuments. Her work was overseen by regular meetings with the principal \ninvestigator and six-weekly meetings with the project steering committee. Once \nunderway, the project\u201fs aims were further refined under three strands: \n1. To describe and analyse the fluid and negotiated relationships between the \nSFNEO and its collaborating networks in the NE region. \n2. To compare the SFNEO to tobacco control management in the other regions of \nEngland. \n3. To study public perceptions of smoking using in-depth qualitative methods in \nthe district of Easington (one of the most deprived districts in the country).\n3\n \nIn addition, three subsidiary outcomes were identified that would be of immediate \nbenefit to the collaborators: to publicize the work of SFNE; to inform and increase the \nefficiency of the SFNEO; and to provide a model of good practice for other regions \nand other public health initiatives. \n \nConfronting Collaboration \nHaving set up the project as an example of excellence in collaborative \nresearch, it became apparent that the strong push for integration, which has been a \nmulti-faceted and generally very positive process, could generate a new set of \nproblems in the key areas of project structure, research methods, and output. \n \nProject Structure \nThe project was designed in line with the AAA\u201fs call to \u201einclude all parties in \nthe research design\u201f. Indeed, three of the co-investigators are also participants, in that \n  \n6 \nthey are involved with SFNE\u201fs intelligence sub-group. Our three named collaborators \nalso work closely with the project. \nMeanwhile, SFNE has used the fact that it is the subject of a major research \nproject as part of its publicity, for instance by including the project in a presentation to \nthe deputy chief medical officer in May 2006. SFNE has incorporated the project as \none element of its own research portfolio, and formal lines of accountability have \nbeen set up\u2014the project reports quarterly to the intelligence sub-group. The potential \nproblem of blurred roles and conflicting identities this could engender was felt by the \ninvestigators and collaborators to be more than made up for by the real benefits \ngenerated by such close links and team working. A number of checks and balances \nbuilt into the design of the project were intended to ensure an appropriate division \nbetween participant and subject. For example, although the project reports to the \nintelligence sub-group, it was written into the project protocol that this group would \n\u201cbe able to make comments on, but not alter, the findings of the project\u201d. \nHowever, such measures require an on-going balancing of the opposing pulls \nof collaboration vs. autonomy. For instance, the SFNEO\u201fs offer of office space was \naccepted, but not its offer of funds to help with expenses. The support of an SFNE \nsecretary as a minute taker was initially accepted, but it subsequently seemed to risk \ncompromising the project\u201fs autonomy. Similarly, it seemed inappropriate for the \nresearcher to use an SFNE e-mail address even though network security measures \nwould have made it much more convenient for her to do so. \nDespite the appeal of having named collaborators involved in project \ngovernance, it became clear that there was a need to separate the role of collaborator \nfrom that of investigator in the project\u201fs steering committee. It would have inhibited \nthe free and frank discussion of project findings concerning SFNE in steering \n  \n7 \ncommittee meetings when members of SFNE were present and it might have been a \nsignificant threat to the holistic goals and multiple perspectives of the project. It was \ntherefore written into the terms of reference of the steering committee after its first \nmeeting that, while the collaborators would no longer sit on the steering committee, \n\u201ctheir involvement in and commitment to the project is fully acknowledged. They are \navailable for individual discussion and e-mail consultation with members of the \nsteering committee\u201d. The collaborators understood and accepted the rationale behind \nthis move. However, this backtracking from the original collaborative structure could \nconceivably have gone badly wrong, leading to accusations of opacity and \nmanipulation. \n \nResearch Methods \nParticipant-observation is one of the central methods in anthropology and one \nof its unique strengths. Participant-observation also accords well with Wanless\u201f \n(2004) call for greater emphasis to be placed on how effective policy implementation \ntakes place through the study of individual interactions and daily working practices. \nParticipant-observation has enabled a detailed understanding of the operations and \nrelationships of the SFNEO relatively quickly because of the lack of the language and \ncultural barriers, and issues of trust, that can hinder participant-observation in \u201eother\u201f \nlands. However, in blending the boundary between data collection and interaction, \nparticipant-observation has thrown up a whole new set of problems.  \nOne of these is the tendency for the researcher and other investigators to \u201ego \nnative\u201f: indeed, in many respects they are \u201enatives\u201f already. Since the start of the \nproject in 2006, the researcher has been able to feel an integral part of the office \n\u201eteam\u201f, to offer advice and counsel on particular issues and, because of the rapport she \n  \n8 \nhas established with the SFNE director, has entered into an on-going relationship of \nfrank exchanges, advice and mutual support. This close relationship, thereby \nachieving an ideal that anthropologists may spend many years working to achieve and \nenabling the \u201eongoing feedback\u201f called for in the collaborative paradigm, has led to \nthe researcher affecting the organisation in unexpected ways.  \nOne area where this has been particularly significant is in the type of \nparticipation with which the researcher has been involved. Rather than learning skills \nthat are quite new, such as a particular agricultural technique or weaving a basket, she \nhas been asked to participate in activities that relate to her skills as a researcher, a \nlecturer, and an anthropologist. Given that these activities are often related to strategic \ndirections within the organization, this input may prove more significant than in other \nfieldwork contexts. A couple of examples may help to clarify this point: \n Participation in a meeting with SFNE\u201fs public relations firm to brainstorm ideas \nfor various media campaigns, including the World No Tobacco Day (31 May \n2006) press releases. In the context of this brainstorming, the researcher was \ninvited to suggest an idea that was accepted and used as the key message for \nSFNE\u201fs media campaign. \n Accompanying the SFNEO team to the World Conference on Tobacco OR Health \nin Washington, D.C., in July 2006. To cover as many of the panels as possible, \neach SFNE delegate including the researcher was asked to attend different panels \nand write a comprehensive report on their return. These reports were compiled \nand presented to SFNE in October 2006, along with the team\u201fs ideas on key \nmessages from the conference. Part of the purpose of the presentation was to \ndetermine the long-term strategic direction of SFNE, so the researcher\u201fs \n  \n9 \ninvolvement had the hypothetical potential to set the direction of SFNE for years \nto come. \nGiven that our subsidiary aims include publicizing the work of the office and \nimproving its efficiency, this type of input seems entirely appropriate. It is also in the \nspirit of the AAA\u201fs call that collaborative research should allow \u201clocal experts to \nwork side-by-side with outside researchers, with a fully dialogic exchange of \nknowledge\u201d (AAA 2002: v.1, pg. 46). However, it does open up the potential for the \nresearcher to have what might be regarded as undue influence on the subject. \u201eUndue \ninfluence\u201f is a legal term meaning. \u201eany improper or wrongful constraint, \nmachination, or urgency of persuasion, by which one's will is overcome and one is \ninduced to do or forbear an act which one would or would not do if left to act freely\u201f.4 \nIt is a useful term in this context because it emphasises a gradation of influence. This \ngradation is welcomed in anthropological research where the power differentials \nbetween researchers and researched is great, with the influence running from the latter \nto the former; our point is that in research with professionals or other elite groups the \nquestion of influence is more problematic and can run both ways, an issue which most \narticles championing collaborative research fail to address. \n \nOutputs  \nIt has been argued (e.g. hooks 1990) that one of the barriers to collaboration in \nanthropological research is the need to translate participants\u201f points of view into an \nacceptably academic or scientific language. However the collaborators in our project \nare highly educated, familiar with academic research and writing, and, in some cases, \nare authors of publications themselves. Their ability to understand the full context of \nacademic writing and to express themselves in its particular language has negated a \n  \n10 \ncrucial rationale for allowing the researcher to filter and reinterpret their discourse. \nThis was exemplified in a meeting that was held in July of this year between two of \nthe collaborators and the authors. The meeting was called by one of the collaborators \nto discuss possible \u201equick\u201f publication routes for the project and it produced ideas for \nthree journal articles. We subsequently met again to comb over an initial draft of one \nof these articles in detail. \nAlthough this has worked exceptionally well, in some ways the ability of a \nparticipant to make suggestions about where and when articles are submitted and to \nhelp determine the core arguments of those articles could be said to have blurred the \nlines between collaboration and the undue influence of that person\u201fs particular \nperspective on the study subject. Furthermore, participants\u201f ability to evaluate a draft \npaper, without interpretation from the author(s), and to express their input in such a \nway that it does not need translation or rewording before it is included in the paper \nmakes their input convincing and immediately usable. This contrasts with those \nparticipants who are not able to engage with the \u201elanguage\u201f of academia in this way. \nAlthough this has led to real inclusion, it also means that the collaborators have a \nstronger voice in project outputs than some of the less senior or less analytically \nminded participants. In other words certain participants, by virtue of their position and \neducation, may have undue influence on our project. \n \nWho Collaborates? \nConflicts have arisen between different groups constituting SFNE. The \nintelligence sub-group, which helped to provide the direction for this project, and the \nproject collaborators, largely reflect one side of these conflicts. Maintaining some \nholistic plurality of voices and opinions, given the centrality of the collaborators\u201f \n  \n11 \nvoices, has required a constant, self-conscious pull away from the integration that the \ncollaborative paradigm calls for. Although this has not yet been identified by \nparticipants as a problem, the fact that these collaborators are at odds with some of the \nother participants from time to time has made the authors aware that there are no \ninherent or structural barriers to prevent the collaborators\u201f voices drowning out those \nof other participants. The problem is how to cope with the \u201edilemma of choice and \npositioning\u201f as we work with (and subsequently write about) \u201cthese intersecting fields \nof power and responsibility\u201d (Gledhill 2003). Had the co-investigators been aware of \nthe conflicts in the planning stages then an easy solution might have been to include a \nrepresentative from one of the conflicting groups as a collaborator. However, this \ncould have resulted in an unwieldy and potentially conflictual group which might \nhave spent more time discussing the conflicts than how the project should describe \nand evaluate them. \n In adopting the expectations and recommendations of collaborative research, \nthe project has effectively given those participants who are already in positions of \npower that much more influence. Increasing their ability to voice the \u201eparticipants\u201f \nperspective\u201f and inform the results, sometimes in very subtle ways, has made it \npotentially more difficult to access the voices and perspectives of those with less \npower. In this case, the ideal of collaboration is working against the decades-long \nemphasis on recognizing the multiple perspectives, voices and powers of different \nsub-groups within a community. \n \nConclusions \nCollaborative research attempts to address differentials of power, education \nand culture that otherwise separate the researcher from his or her subjects in \n  \n12 \ndeleterious ways. Our point is that collaborative research within anthropology appears \nto be premised on such differentials of power, and that where such differentials are \nlacking, the field is open for dominant individuals (either researcher or researched) to \nassume what is potentially \u201eundue influence\u201f over the results. Our project appears to \nbe maintaining a delicate balance between the conflicting aims of representing a \nholistic plurality of voices and collaboration. However, if any results are released that \nmight be interpreted as critical of one group or another within SFNE, this could put \nthe collaborative paradigm in jeopardy. The project steering committee has some \ninbuilt mechanisms whereby the researcher\u201fs position and role is scrutinised and, \nperhaps, readjusted at regular intervals. Anthropological ethics and methods training \noffer little help in this respect. Major professional anthropological organisations and \nfunders such as the NPRI and the UK funding councils are encouraging more \ncollaboration, more feedback of research results and more involvement of participants \nin the planning and implementation phases of the project, embedding these ideals into \ntheir ethical codes. However, to guard against the potential for undue influence \ndescribed, it is necessary to go against the centripetal pull (of collaboration) and set \nboundaries that enable a separation between project and subject - boundaries that were \noriginally dissolved to make the project more attractive to its funders, as well as the \ninvestigators themselves.  \n \nNotes \n1.  In this way, the concept of collaboration can be usefully compared with that of \n\u201eparticipation\u201f and its underlying assumptions in the development literature, which \nhave recently been the subject of similar critiques (e.g. Cleaver 2004; Christens and \nSpeer 2006). \n  \n13 \n \n2. Membership of the advisory panel includes representatives from the strategic health \nauthorities, the primary care organisations (PCOs), local authorities, the regional \nassembly, the Voluntary Organisations\u201f Network North East, the Health and Safety \nExecutive, the North East Trading Standards Association, the North East Chamber of \nCommerce, the patient-public involvement forum, regional universities, One North \nEast (the region\u201fs development agency), and the Trades Union Congress. The chair is \nthe regional director of public health advisory panel and four other members represent \ndifferent NHS organisations. \n \n2. http:\/\/www.easington.gov.uk\/services\/regenpart\/nrenewal\/nreasington.asp \n[accessed 6 September 2007]. \n \n3.
