Mangrove forests and \nadjacent mudflats are increasingly impacted by urban\/industrial development in the \ntropical coastal zone, suffering pollution from multiple sources including but not \nlimited to municipal waste, aquaculture, mariculture and shipping as well as onshore \nindustries and run-off from urban centres (Cuong et al. 2005; Huang et al. 2003; Zheng \net al. 2000). Sediments that accumulate in mangroves are potential repositories of \nanthropogenic pollution because of high total organic carbon content, anaerobic \nproperties and rapid turnover and burial (Marchand et al. 2005; Tam and Yao, 2002). \nThe world wide denigration and loss of mangrove habitats is of global concern given \nthey account for an estimated 11 % of the input of terrestrially-derived carbon into the \nocean and about 10 % dissolved organic carbon (DOC) sourced from land; the long \nterm effect of altering the carbon cycle is uncertain (Dittmar et al. 2006; Jennerjahn and \nIttekkot, 2002). It has been widely postulated that mangroves afford physical protection \nagainst catastrophic storm events such as hurricanes and tsunamis (Alongi, 2007). \nRecent  post-impact surveys along the Tamil Nadu coast follwing the 2004 Indian \nOcean tsunami confirmed this notion and demonstrated that man-made structures built \nbehind mangroves were significantly less damaged than their unprotected counterparts \n(Alongi, 2007). \n \nHistorically, mangrove swamps bounding the South China Sea have been \nexploited for a variety of economic purposes and in some instances entirely destroyed \n(Morton and Blackmore, 2001). In mainland China, mangrove forests once fringed the \nmajority of the south coast, since 1940\u2019s rapid urbanization, agricultural development \n 1\nin the form of rice farming and embankment for aquaculture ponds has resulted in the \nloss of 66% of mangrove forests (Li and Lee, 1997). Today, natural mangrove forests \noccur sporadically from 18 \u00b0N to 27\u00b0N latitude along the coasts of Hainan, Guangdong, \nGuangxi, Fujian and Taiwan provinces, covering an area of about 22,639 ha (Li and \nLee, 1997). However, artificially introduced mangrove forests comprised of Kandelia \ncandel were successfully transplanted in Zhejiang province at 28\u00b0 25\u00b4 N in the 1950\u2019s. \nOverall a total of 36 true and semi mangrove plant species are distrbuted in China, 35 in \nHainan, 19 Guangdong, 18 Guangxi, 17 in Taiwan, 11 in Hong Kong, nine in Fujian \nand five in Macau, and one introduced species in Zhejiang (Fan, 2004). Recent \nrecognition of the importance of ecological, biogeochemical and hydrological \nfunctions of mangroves has lead to 6 state and 17 local protected reserves being \nestablished (Fan, 2004).  \n \nPersistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons \n(PAH), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) are \nof particular concern because of the effect these may have on fauna and flora of \nmangroves. Monitoring of organic pollutants can therefore alert coastal managers of \npossible impacts upon the detritus driven food web which can potentially lead to the \nbioaccumulation of contaminants in organisms which may ultimately be consumed by \nhumans as food. Furthermore, organic pollutants at high concentrations can cause \ngrowth impairment of halophytic plants which in turn may limit buffering of storm \nevents and stabilisation of coastal sediments (Mrozek et al. 1983; Tam et al. 2005).  \n \nStudies of organic pollution in mangrove sediments of China have primarily \nfocused on sites in close proximity to heavily populated\/urbanized industrial centres \nsuch as Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Guangzhou. Temporal monitoring of a major \ndischarge of fuel oil onto Sheung Pak Nai Mangrove (Hong Kong) revealed a decrease \nin TPH concentrations from 60-80 \u00b5g\/g to 30-40 \u00b5g\/g after one year, the decline in \nTPH being attributed to weathering of the oil (Tam et al. 2005). However, the same \nstudy also reported TPH concentrations as high as 1000 \u00b5g\/g in the root zones of \nmangrove sediments, suggesting that oil pollution from a single point source can lead to \nhighly variable TPH values even in the same mangrove swamp. Sediment samples \ncollected from mangrove forest and mudflats of Inner Deep Bay (Mai Po Wetlands) in \nShenzhen in 1999 reported TPH concentrations ranging from 267 to 363 \u00b5g\/g, \nconfirming that concentrations were similar in both mangrove forest and mudflat \nsediment (Zheng et al. 2000).  \n \nAccumulation of PAHs in mangrove sediments of China has been previously \nobserved. Sediment samples collected from mangrove forest and mudflats of Inner \nDeep Bay (Mai Po Wetlands) in Shenzhen in 1999 showed PAH concentrations of 180 \nto 830 \u00b5g\/kg and 630 to 960 \u00b5g\/kg respectively (Zheng et al. 2002). Comparison of \ntotal PAH concentrations along transects revealed a decline in values from the edge of \nmangrove forest to sea, where mudflat sediment cores (0-35 cm) showed little vertical \nchange in PAH content (Zheng et al. 2002). The variation in PAH content along \n 2\ntransect was attributed to an increase in depositional flux of PAH into the sediment \nassociated with loss of tidal current energy, in contrast the uniform down core PAH \nprofiles were suggested to be caused by a high degree of sediment mixing (Zheng et al. \n2002). Ascription of petrogenic\/combustion PAH input using isomeric ratios revealed a \nmainly combustion related source derived from local anthropogenic pyrolytic sources.    \nAnother study of twelve surface sediments from Futian mangrove which lies \napproximately 2 km NE of the Mai Po and inner Deep Bay site reported PAH \nconcentrations 237 to 726 \u00b5g\/kg (Zhang et al. 2004).   \n \nPolychlorinated biphenyls pose significant health risks to humans and are listed as \none of the \"dirty dozen\" contaminants, their current production and use being restricted \nin countries that are signatories of the Stockholm convention (May 22, 2001). The \ncontamination of ten mangrove sites by PCBs in Hong Kong showed relatively low \ntotal concentrations ranging from 0.5-5.8 \u00b5g\/kg with the exception of mangroves from \nYi O, Tolo Pond and Lai Chi Wo which were identified as hot spots and gave PCB \nconcentrations in the range of 11 to 25 \u00b5g\/kg (Tam and Yao, 2002). Similar \nconcentrations of PCBs (4.9 to 27.6 \u00b5g\/kg) were reported from mangrove sediments at \nMai Po marshes nature reserve in Hong Kong (Zheng et al. 2000).  \n       \nIn the light that only a small proportion of mangroves in China have been examined \nfor POPs we undertook a screening survey of mangrove surface sediments from \nmainland sites in the southwest (Beihai, Zhanjian) south (Shenzhen) and south eastern \ncoast  (Xiamen) as well as Hainan Island. The primary aim of this study was to \ndetermine individual concentrations of PAHs, PCBs and saturate and aromatic \nhydrocarbons as well as trace metals. The focus of the study was to determine \nconcentrations of organic and metal pollution in mangrove sediments from developed \nand less developed coastal sites, along with evaluating potential sources of \naccumulating pollutants.  \n \nMangrove sediments were collected from October to November 2006 using \npre-determined GPS co-ordinates to accurately locate each position (Fig. 1). \nPolycarbonate tubes, fitted with stainless steel basket core catcher at the base were \nmanually driven into the exposed sediment and extracted to recover the core material. \nAt each mangrove swamp, five sediment cores within an approximately 100 m2 area \nwere collected from depths of 0-30 cm. Sediments were then transported back to the \nlaboratory at ~0\u00baC where each of the five batches of samples were mixed in equal \nproportion in order to minimize the influence of highly localized hot-spots and stored at \n\u201370\u00b0C. The samples were freeze-dried, sieved to pass a brass mesh of aperture 2 mm \nand a portion of the <2 mm fractions analysed for PAH.  The remainder was ground to \na fine powder using a Retsch PM400 ball mill and analysed for TOC, TPH and PCB \ncontent. Thus each of the nine samples represents a composite of five surface \nsediments. The principal advantage of this approach being that a more representative \n\u201cbackground\u201d sample is captured.  \n \n 3\nAll concentrations herein are reported on a dry weight basis. Silver-foil cups \ncontaining 100-1000 mg dried mangrove sediment were treated with excess acid (HCl, \n50% v\/v) to remove inorganic carbon and then oven dried at 100\u00b0C \u00b15\u00b0C for 1.5 h. \nTotal Organic Carbon (TOC) was determined using a Elementar VarioMax C, N \nanalyser controlled using \u2018VarioMax\u2019 software. The limits of quantification reported \nfor a typical 300mg sample were 0.18%.  \n \nFor each TPH preparation dried sediments (\u223c2 g) were extracted with \ndichloromethane (DCM) \/ acetone (1:1 v\/v) mixture using a ASE 200 (Dionex) \nsystem operated at 175\u00b0C, pressure 2000 psi, heat-up time 1 min, static time 8 \nminutes, flush volume 120%, purge time 60 s, total solvent used 37-44 mL per sample. \nThe resulting solvent extract was rotary evaporated to 5 mL, quantitatively transferred \nto a glass vial (10mL), reduced to dryness using a stream of nitrogen gas and stored in \ndarkness at 4\u00b0C. Prior to analysis each sample was dissolved in 1 mL toluene. A 5 \u00b5L \naliquot was spotted on to silica rod (Chromarods-S III) using a programmed \nauto-spotter fitted with a 10 \u00b5L syringe. The rods were developed for 21 min using \n100 mL n-hexane and then for 8 min with toluene 100 mL. The concentration of \nsaturated and aromatic hydrocarbons was determined using by an Iatroscan Mk6s \ninstrument fitted with a flame ionization detector (FID) and operated using Chrom \nStar software. Using the standard method for substitution of non-detects i.e. 0.5 x \nLOD all TPH concentrations below LOD (Limit of Detection 3 mg\/kg) were assessed \nas contributing 1.5 mg\/kg (Helsel, 2006).  \n \nFor each total mercury (THg) preparation 0.5 g sediment was transferred to a 50 \nmL graduated glass stoppered boiling tube and 5 mL deionised water and 5 mL of aqua \nregia added. The combined solutions were left connected to an air condenser overnight \nat room temperature then subsequently heated to boiling point and maintained at that \ntemperature for a minimum of 2 h. Once cooled to room temperature the solution was \ndiluted to 50mL with deionised water and shaken to mix. After settling a 5 mL aliquot \nwas removed by pipette and diluted with \u00d7 5 (4+1 v\/v) using deionised water to give a \n2% solution with respect to HCl. The samples were analysed using a PSA atomic \nfluorescence spectrometer system comprising a XYZ Autosampler and a Millennium \nMerlin operated with an Ar flow rate of 30-50 psi and detector set at 253.7 nm. The \nlimit of detection for this set of analyses was 0.04 mg\/kg. Quality control was \nachieved by subjecting two certified reference materials to the above procedure. \n \n For the other trace metals pressed powder pellets were prepared by grinding \n12.00 g of sample and 3.00 g of binder in an agate planetary ball mill for 30 minutes. \nThe mixture was then pressed at 25 tons load into 40 mm diameter pellets.  The \nbinder used is a mixture of 9 parts EMU120FD, a styrene copolymer, and 1 part \nCeridust 3620, a micronised polyethylene wax. The XRFS Spectrometer used for \nmajor elements was an Axios Advanced with a 60 kV generator and 4 kW rhodium \n(Super Sharp Max) end\u2013window X-ray tube controlled via PC running PANalytical \nSuperQ XRF Pro-Trace application package. For trace element analysis, a set of \n 4\nsynthetic standards (Pro-Trace) was used to calibrate the instruments and to determine \nbackground and spectral interference correction factors.  The PANalytical Pro-Trace \ncalibration algorithm is used to fit calibration lines, applying matrix correction using \nmass attenuation coefficients. The calibrations were validated by analysis of a wide \nrange of Reference Materials. Quality Control was maintained by regular analysis of \ntwo glass monitor samples containing 47 elements at nominally 30 \u00b5g\/g and 300 \u00b5g\/g \nand the results entered into run charts for statistical analysis using a SPC package.  \nLower limits of detection (LLD) are theoretical values for the concentration \nequivalent to three standard deviations (99.7% confidence interval) above the \nbackground count rate for the analyte in an iron-rich alumino-silicate matrix. \n \nPAH analysis was based on a previously published HPLC method employed for \nthe determination of PAHs in estuarine sediments (Vane et al. 2007a; Vane et al. \n2007b). For the PAH extraction of each sample, approximately 15g was weighed into a \npre-cleaned 50 mL amber bottle. To this was added 25 mL of a 1:1 v\/v mix of \nacetonitrile and tetrahydrofuran (THF), both of HPLC grade. The bottle was sealed \nwith a screw-cap closure containing a PTFE-faced silicone rubber septum. After \nsealing the bottle was shaken to suspend the contents, which, were then sonicated in a \nheated ultrasonic bath (Camlab, 300W) for 45 minutes at 50\u00b0C. During this period the \nbottle was occasionally inverted and shaken to continually re-suspend the sample. The \nbottle was then stored in the dark for about 2 hours, to permit some clarification of the \nsupernatant, before taking a 2 mL aliquot in a gas-tight glass syringe, attaching a     \n0.2 \u00b5m in-line syringe filter (25 mm dia. - Nylon 66), and filtering the extract into an \namber 4 mL vial (with PTFE-faced screw cap closure) having first discarded the first \nfew drops of filtrate. The clarified extracts were stored in a refrigerator to await analysis \nwhich took place as soon as possible after extraction. \n \nQuality control was achieved by subjecting a well-characterised, low-level PAH \nproficiency-testing marine sediment (Quasimeme \u2013 QPH048MS) to the above \nprocedure (except that a weighed 2.5 g was used) and analysing it by the same method \nas for the samples. A procedural blank prepared from 15g white quartz sand (Sigma \nAldrich, UK) \u2013 a material devoid of PAH - was treated in a similar fashion.   \n \nFiltered sample extracts (including those of the QCs and the procedural blanks) \nwere injected into the HPLC system (Waters 600E) via a 5 \u03bcL sample loop (Rheodyne).  \nThe eluent flowrate through the separation column (Lichrospher\u00aePAH 250 mm x 4.0 \nmm i.d.) was 0.7 mL\/min. The column was surrounded by a column heater\/chiller \n(Grace\/Vydac 7995R) to maintain it at a constant 25.0\u00b0C \u00b1 0.1\u00b0C. Separation of 17 \nPAHs was achieved within 45 mins by gradient programming the eluent. Far-UV \nHPLC grade acetonitrile (Rathburn Ltd.) and HPLC grade water (Milli-Q) were \npumped as a 65% : 35% mix, respectively, at the start of each chromatographic run.  \nImmediately thereafter, up to 14 minutes, the proportion of acetonitrile was \ncontinuously increased from 65% to 100% using a concave gradient (Waters curve 9). \n 5\nFrom 14 minutes until the end of the run (45 mins.) elution with 100% acetonitrile was \nmaintained.   \n \nAs the PAHs exited the column they were directed into a scanning fluorescence \ndetector (Waters 474). The detector was programmed so that optimized excitation and \nemission wavelengths for the PAHs were selected based on their retention times. The \nfollowing 17 PAHs were included in this study:  acenaphthene, anthracene, \nbenz[a]anthracene, benzo[a]pyrene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, benzo[g,h,i]perylene, \nbenzo[k]fluoranthene, chrysene, dibenz[a,h]anthracene, fluoranthene, fluorene, \nindeno[1,2,3-c,d]pyrene, 1-methylnaphthalene, naphthalene, perylene, phenanthrene, \npyrene.  \n \n \nThe method used to extract and determine PCB concentrations, was based on that \ndescribed by Ayris et al. 1997. Briefly, sediments were spiked with authentic standards, \nmixed with an equal amount of anhydrous sodium sulphate and extracted with \nhexane\/acetone (1:1v\/v) in an accelerated solvent extraction system ASE 200 (Dionex). \nExtracts were eluted through a Pasteur pipette containing anhydrous sodium sulphate \n(1g) and Florisil with 10 mL of n-hexane. The eluant was extracted with \ndimethylsulphoxide (DMSO, 2 \u00d7 12 mL) and diluted with 18 M\u03a9 de-ionised water (25 \nmL) prior to extraction with n-hexane (50 mL). The n-hexane extracts were combined \nand the volume reduced to 5 mL and passed through anhydrous sodium sulphate (1g) \nand the volume reduced to approximately 100 \u03bcL using a gentle stream of nitrogen gas.  \n \nCombined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was performed on a \nCarlo Erba Mega 500 series gas chromatograph (GC) directly coupled to a Varian \n1200L triple quadropole mass spectrometer operating in full scan mode (ionization \nenergy 70 eV, mass range 39-550 amu). Sample application (1 \u03bcL) was by \nsplit\/splitless injection; the GC was fitted with a fused silica ZB-5 column (60 m length \nx 0.32 mm i.d. x 0.25 \u00b5m film thickness). The GC oven was temperature-programmed \nfrom 100\u00b0C (1 min. isothermal) to 200\u00b0C (at 5\u00b0C \/ min.) to 280\u00b0C (at 2.4\u00b0C \/ min.) to \n320\u00b0C (at 20\u00b0C \/ min.) and held isothermally at 320\u00b0C for 5 min and helium was used \nas carrier gas at 16 p.s.i. The limit of detection (LOD) based on the minimum \nconcentrations that gave clearly defined peaks was between 0.1-0.20 \u03bcg\/kg. Quality \ncontrol was achieved by subjecting a PCB certified reference material (LGC 6113 \u2013 \nSoil) to the above procedure and analysing it by the same method as for the samples. A \nprocedural blank prepared from white quartz sand (Sigma Aldrich, UK) \u2013 a material \ndevoid of PCBs - was treated in a similar fashion.  \n \nThe saturated hydrocarbon concentrations of sediments from selected mangroves \nranged from 32-533 mg\/kg and the aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations ranged from \n<3 to 37 mg\/kg (Table 1). Total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) ranged from 32-570 \nmg\/kg (Table 1). Sediments from Shenzhen (6) exhibited higher TPH concentrations \nat 570 mg\/kg than other mangrove sites reflecting a possible localized urban pollutant \n 6\ndischarge source, hydrocarbons from vehicle exhausts or combustion products from \nfactories. In contrast the TPH concentrations in Hainan Island mangrove sediments, \nnamely stations 2, 7, 8 and 9 had a mean of 51 mg\/kg, confirming low levels of \nhydrocarbons. This was not unexpected given that much of Hainan Island has a lower \nproportion of urabn\/industrial land use than other mainland coastal cities such as \nShenzhen. Unpolluted sediments have been shown to contain up to 100 mg\/kg of \nhydrocarbons derived from biological inputs such as algae and plant waxes, whereas \nheavily contaminated estuarine and coastal sediments yield approximately 1000 \nmg\/kg hydrocarbons or more (Volkman et al. 1992; Volkman and Nichols, 1991). \nUsing this benchmark, it is clear that only the sediment from Shenzhen (6) is polluted \nwith petroleum hydrocarbons. However, there are no widely recognised toxicological \nbenchmarks for the evaluation of TPH in marine sediments. \n \nPrevious studies of total petroleum hydrocarbon pollutants in Chinese mangroves \nand near-shore sediments reported concentrations in the range of 6-1996 mg\/kg with \nthe highest values observed in Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong and the lowest at Shek O \nBeach (Zheng and Richardson, 1999). With the exception of Shenzhen (6) the values \nreported in the current study fall at the lower end of TPH concentrations observed in \nmangrove sediments from China and are broadly comparable to those from Sheung \nPak Nai Mangroves, Hong Kong but lower than Mai Po Mangroves, Hong Kong \n(Table 2) (Tam et al. 2005; Zheng et al. 2000). \n \nThe elemental composition of mangrove sediments are presented in Table 3. \nConcentrations of Hg in surface sediments from S. China mangroves ranged from \n<0.04 to 0.17 to mg\/kg (dry wt) (Table 3). Similarly Hg values of about 0.020 to \n0.127 mg\/kg have been reported in the South China Sea off the Malaysian coast \n(Kannan and Falandysz, 1998). World wide, marine, coastal and estuarine sediments \nhave Hg background levels of approximately 0.02-0.1 mg\/kg (Kannan and Falandysz, \n1998; Shi et al. 2007), on this basis seven of the samples had Hg concentrations close \nto background and two sediments had concentrations just above that expected from a \ncoastal sediments with little or no anthropogenic Hg input. In this current study of \nmangrove sediments, sites in close proximity to Shenzhen (6) and Xiamen (5) had the \nhighest Hg values where as those from Wengchang (1) and Haikou (2, 7, 8, 9), Hainan \nIsland were three to four times lower (<0.04-0.06 mg\/kg) (Table 2). One plausible \nexplanation for this difference maybe due to the greater discharge of Hg from the \nmajor urban\/industrial centers of Shenzhen (6) and Xiamen (5) as compared to the \nother less urbanized mangrove sites, alternatively the elevated concentrations maybe \ndue to an unidentified local point sources. \n \nComparison of these sediment Hg concentrations from S. China mangroves \n(<0.04 to 0.17 mg\/kg) indicated that they were less less contaminated than other \ncoastal\/estuarine areas: Seine estuary, France (0.46 mg\/kg) San Francisco Bay, USA \n(0.2 mg\/kg), Victoria Harbour Hong Kong (0.247 mg\/kg), Gdansk, Poland (0.32 \nmg\/kg) or the Anadyr estuary, Russia (339 mg\/kg) (Kannan and Falandysz, 1998; Shi \n 7\net al. 2007). \n \n The significance of the As, Cr, Cu, Pb, Ni and Zn concentrations were evaluated \nby comparison with threshold effect concentrations (TEC) and probable effect \nconcentrations (PEC) for metals which provide a benchmark above and below which \nadverse effects on sensitive sediment dwelling organisms maybe observed in the field \n(Table 3) (MacDonald et al. 2000; Long et al. 1995). For the Beihai (3) mangrove, all \nelements were less than published TEC and PEC, indicating that they were \ntoxicologically unimportant. In contrast, for Hainan mangroves (1,2,7,8,9) sediment \nCr and Ni ranged from 109 to 437 \u00b5g\/g and 50 to 159 \u00b5g\/g (Table 3), respectively, \nexceeding their PEC benchmarks (MacDonald et al. 2000). Previous surveys of heavy \nmetals in sediment cores from Mersey Estuary, UK have shown that grain-size can \ngreatly alter the contaminant profile due to complexation and sorption of metals with \nclays and that normalization to Ga, a proxy for grain-size is required in sediments of \nvariable composition (Ridgway et al. 2003; Ridgway and Shimmield, 2002). In this \ncurrent study, non-normalized and Ga-normalised Cr and Ni concentrations were \nsimilar suggesting that these metals may adversely affect sediment dwelling biota. \nAlthough Cr and Ni values for four of the Hainan mangroves were above PEC this \ndoes not necessarily indicate an anthropogenic source since these could be of \ngeogenic origin (natural background); this notion was confirmed in part upon \ncomparison of Fe element with Cr and Ni (Table 3). However unequivocal \nidentification of metals from anthropogenic and natural sources in estuaries and \ncoastal zones is complex and requires assessment of sediment samples from \nuncontaminated rivers, catchement area and downstream of contaminant sources \n(Ridgway et al. 2003).  \n \nOverall As, Cu, Pb, and Zn concentrations were relatively low and either below \nor between TEC and PEC values for all mangrove sites (Table 3). Other studies have  \nnoted that mangrove roots contain Cu, Pb, Zn in about equal concentrations as the \nsurrounding sediment where as those in leaf tissues were at most about half that of the \nroots (MacFarlane et al. 2007). From a sediment quality guideline standpoint (TEC \nand PEC) the Hg concentrations encountered at Shenzhen (0.17 mg\/kg) and Xiamen \n(0.12mg\/kg) are below the 0.18 mg\/kg threshold effect concentration (TEC) for THg \nin freshwater sediments (MacDonald et al. 2000). Studies performed on marine and \nestuarine sediments using various indicator species have reported that Hg \nconcentrations below 0.15 mg\/kg have minimal effect on certain sediment dwelling \nanimals and plants, where as for concentrations between 0.15 and 0.71 mg\/kg effects \nare possible and at or above 0.71 mg\/kg the effects are probable (Long et al. 1995). \nComparison of the Hg mangrove sediment concentrations to soil quality benchmark \ncriteria suggested that sediments from these S. China mangrove sites (1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9) \nare below concentrations predicted to harm the biota, where as those from Xiamen (5) \nand Shenzhen (6) maybe threatened with adverse effects from Hg exposure. Overall \nthe Hg concentrations were below that expected to pose a major detrimental threat to \nbenthic organisms.      \n 8\n  \nIn addition to PAH sediment analyses a three QCs, three procedural blanks and \nnine duplicate sample determinations were conducted at regular intervals. The results \nof the QC analysis, together with information on wavelength programming, are \npresented in Table 4. The limits of quantification (LoQ) are shown in Table 5, and were \ndetermined from the analysis of the procedural blanks, (i.e. the areas of peaks in the \nblanks with the same retention times as a given PAH were averaged and three times the \nstandard deviation was added to that average to give the LoQ of that PAH). Certified \nreference material analyses were within certified values (Table 4).     \n \nTotal (i.e. \u03a317 PAHs) and individual PAH concentrations are displayed in Table 5. \nIt will observed that the totals ranged from 24 \u00b5g\/kg to 238 \u00b5g\/kg. In some cases \n(Samples 1, 2, 4 & 9) it was not possible to quantify the pyrene content of the samples \nbecause of the extensive overlap, during HPLC analysis, of a large peak of an \nunknown material with a retention time very close to that of pyrene. For these \nsamples, therefore, the total PAH concentrations are \u03a316 PAHs. It can be seen that the \ntotal PAH concentrations revealed by this study are low compared with those obtained \nfrom similar investigations of surface sediments from mangrove communities (Tables \n6 & 7). Nevertheless, they are substantially higher than the total of 7.25 \u00b5g\/kg \ndetermined for the coastal sediment from a pristine site at Kat O Wharf, Hong Kong \n(Zheng & Richardson, 1999). A study of the available literature, typically reveals \nlarge variations in total PAH concentrations even for surficial mangrove sediment \nsamples taken from the same locations (Table 6), e.g. Ho Chung: 189-329 \u00b5g\/kg (Guo \net al. 2005) cf. 1273-11098 \u00b5g\/kg (Tam et al. 2001) and similarly for Mai Po: \n212-1042 \u00b5g\/kg (Zheng et al. 2000) cf. 1007-4842 \u00b5g\/kg (Tam et al. 2002).    \n \nThe samples in this study emanated from widely geographically separated \nsources along the coasts of S. China. Any commonality displayed in their PAH \ndistribution patterns may therefore be presumed to result from either their being \ncollected from sites specifically within mangrove systems, or from their exposure to \nubiquitous influences that globally affect surficial sediments, e.g. deposition of \npyrolitic PAHs that have undergone aeolian transport (Jaward et al. 2004). \n \nAll, to a greater or lesser extent, possess significant concentrations of those PAHs \ntaken to characterise pyrolitic sources. Thus, all contain measurable quantities of \npyrolytic-originating PAHs: fluoranthene, pyrene, chrysene, benzo[b+k]fluoranthenes, \nbenzo[a]pyrene, benzo[g,h,i]perylene, benz[a]anthracene and indeno[1,2,3-c,d]pyrene \n(Table 5). Even in those cases where the quantification of pyrene was confounded by \nthe presence of an unknown interfering material its presence was still discernible in \nthe form of a distortion to the unknown\u2019s chromatographic peak shape. These nine, \ntogether with phenanthrene - which also can arise from combustion processes \n(Budzinski et al. 1997) - were, of course, found at comparatively low concentrations \nin those samples where the total concentrations of PAH were low and as such may \nprobably be attributed, in the main, to the global background atmospheric deposition \n 9\nof pyrolitic emissions. \n   \nHowever, in the two samples with the highest total concentrations of PAH, i.e. \nsamples Xiamen (5) and Shenzhen (6), elevated concentrations of the nine \ncharacteristic pyrolitic PAHs were encountered. This would seem to argue some \nlocalized input of pyrolitic PAH in these samples, probably from the proximity of the \nlarge cities of Xiamen and Shenzhen, whereas, for the other samples the presence of \npyrolitic PAHs likely stems from the global aeolian deposition attending long-range \natmospheric transport processes. A hierarchical cluster analysis of PAH composition \npatterns, based on the squared Euclidean distance metric and Ward\u2019s minimum \nvariance algorithm (Ward, 1963), produced a dendogram, shown in Fig. 2, that \nprovided supporting evidence for the similarity of the samples from Xiamen and \nShenzhen and their difference from the other samples.  \n \nAnother indication that the Xiamen\/Shenzhen samples differed from other \nsamples was emphasised by the the construction of a plot of total PAH concentrations \nagainst TOC% (Fig. 3, Table 6). A strong correlation between PAH and TOC (r2 = \n0.97) was found to exist for all samples other than those from Xiamen and Shenzhen. \nWhen these latter were included the overall correlation was much weaker (r2 = 0.11). \nThe strong correlation should not necessarily be taken to imply a causal relationship \nbut it would seem that TOC has a controlling influence on PAH sorption to sediments \nwith low total PAH concentrations. For the samples from Xiamen and Shenzhen, \nwhere PAH concentrations were higher than for the other mangrove samples, the \nlikely contamination of the sediments by local PAH sources could be the reason for \ntheir non-correlation. Such interference of localized inputs of PAH pollution with a \nlinear relationship between total PAHs and TOC has previously been invoked to \nexplain the behaviour of mangrove sediments in the Hong Kong region (Ke et al. \n2005).       \n \n Isomeric ratio cross plots were constructed based on the relative concentrations of \nisomeric pairs of PAHs whose ratios have been identified as diagnostic of PAH source \n(Yunker et al. 2002). Traditionally, the ratio between the concentration of fluoranthene \nand that of fluoranthene and pyrene summed is plotted as the abcissa of such cross \nplots. However, since a full set of pyrene data were unavailable (because of peak \ninterference problems) our cross plots were performed employing the ratio between \nthe concentration of anthracene and that of anthracene and phenanthrene summed as \nthe abcissa (see Fig. 4). Two cross plots were established; the first using the ratio of \nthe concentration of benz[a]anthracene to that of benz[a]anthracene and chrysene \nsummed as the ordinate, and the second the ratio of the concentration of \nindeno[1,2,3-c,d]pyrene to that of indeno[1,2,3-c,d]pyrene and benzo[g,h,i]perylene \nsummed as the ordinate. Again the similarity between samples Xiamen (5) and  \nShenzhen (6) and their difference from the other samples is highlighted, as is the \npredominance of combustion-related PAH sources for the Xiamen\/Shenzhen samples.             \n \n 10\nThe prominence of phenanthrene, perylene and naphthalene in all the samples is \nnoticeable, and is pronounced in four of the samples (Stations 1, 2, 4 & 9) where these \nthree PAHs predominate. The relative abundances of phenanthrene, perylene and \nnaphthalene are indicated (as bold numerals) on the column charts employed to show \nthe distribution patterns of the PAHs in the samples (Fig. 5). For all the samples at \nleast one of the three is the dominant PAH. Thus, for five of the samples (Stations 3, 4, \n7, 8 & 9) phenanthrene predominates and for four (Stations 1, 2, 5 & 6) perylene is \nthe most abundant PAH. These results are interesting, particularly in light of a recent \npublication concerning the global patterns of PAHs in soils (Wilcke, 2007), where the \nauthor has suggested that PAH patterns in soils result from the combination of two \nmain distinctive inputs, i.e. the first being a background pattern of \nbiogenically-generated PAHs, dominated by naphthalene, phenanthrene and perylene \nwhich also includes the global background aeolian deposition, upon which is \nsuperimposed a second anthropogenic pattern consisting in the main of the high \nmolecular weight pyrolitic PAHs. Our sediments appear to conform to, and support, \nthe hypothesis of Wilcke. Because the anthropogenic loading for our samples, though \nsignificant, is low, the presence of the biological and diffuse source patterns \nassociated with the biogenic\/aeolian background become enhanced and, therefore, \neasily discerned. It also explains the notable instances of predominance of \nphenanthrene for our samples, compared with its frequent non-dominance in other \nmangrove sediments, as exhibited in the relative abundance order of the USEPA PAHs \n(Table 6).          \n \nThere is also the possibility that the marked naphthalene and phenanthrene \nconcentrations in some of the samples (Stations 1, 2, 4, 8 & 9) could betoken a \npetrogenic contribution to the PAH patterns arising, from unburnt petroleum (Aislabie \net al. 1999), e.g. by oil spills and leakage from boats and ships.  The presence of \nnaphthalene in Hong Kong mangrove sediments at 10-20% of the total PAH \nconcentrations was presumed to stem mainly from anthropogenic activities, especially \npetrogenic inputs (Tam et al. 2001).  When the ratio of the concentration of \nnaphthalene to that of phenanthrene is greater than one then fresh and unweathered \npetroleum is indicated (Dahle et al. 2003; Olajire et al. 2005). Inspection of Table 6 \nreveals that only one of our samples satisfied this condition, i.e. Haikou (2). However, \nmilitating against a primarily petrogenic origin for naphthalene, in those samples \nwhere its concentrations are pronounced (Stations 1, 2, 4, 8 & 9), are the \ncomparatively low accompanying concentrations of 1-methylnaphthalene and \nacenaphthene. It might reasonably be expected that these would be comparable for \neither a weathered, or an unweathered, major petroleum contribution (Farias et al. \n2008; Wang et al. 1999; Wang et al. 2004). It is also pertinent to note that in a study of \nthe Mai Po marshes nature reserve, the naphthalene content of the mangrove \nsediments was high in contrast to the mudflat samples where naphthalene was largely \nundetectable (Zheng et al. 2000). This situation could conceivably arise from the \nmuch greater biological activity of the mangrove cf. mudflat environment (Marchand \net al. 2005), with accordingly the possibility of naphthalene biogenesis in the former \n 11\n(Wilcke, 2007; Krauss et al. 2005). \n \n Inspection of Table 6 reveals that perylene formed between 11.2% and 20.8% of \nthe total PAH concentrations, (except for the Behai (2) sediment where this was only \n2.0%). Although there may well be a pyrolitic contribution to the perylene content, its \nrelatively high concentrations in the majority our sediments points to its having a \nprimarily biogenic provenance (Venkatesan, 1988).  Investigations of biomass and \ndiesel burning reveal perylene to be a comparatively minor component of the total \nPAHs released by the combustion process, e.g. for a variety of cereals the maximum \nemission was 4.6% during corn burning (Jenkins et al. 1996); 2.4% was found in \ndiesel soot (Wang et al. 1999) and 0.01-0.02% in unburned diesel (Wang et al. 1999; \nMi et al. 2000). Accordingly, in a recent study, whenever perylene occurred at >10% \nof the total concentration of parent PAHs (\u03a317 PAHs) its origin was attributed \nprincipally to biogenesis (B\u00edcego et al. 2006). On this basis all our sediments, except \nfor Behai (2), may be considered to possess a substantial biogenic component.             \n \nTotal PAH threshold effect concentration levels (TEC) and probable effect \nconcentration levels (PEC) in freshwater sediments are reported as 1610 \u00b5g\/kg and \n22,800 \u00b5g\/kg respectively (Ingersoll et al. 2000; MacDonald et al. 2000). All of the \nsediments in this current work were below the TEC concentration, indicating that the \nPAH content was not toxic to organisms living in the sediment.   \n \nTotal PCB concentrations ranged from 2 to 6 \u00b5g\/kg with a mean concentration of \n4 \u00b5g\/kg (Fig. 6). The low values encountered in the surface sediments support the \nnotion that the mangrove sites had not received any appreciable PCB contamination. \nSimilarly moderate PCB concentrations (0.5-5.8 \u00b5g\/kg) have been reported for Hong \nKong mangrove sediments with the exception of mangroves from Yi O, Tolo Pond \nand Lai Chi Wo which were identified as hot spots and gave values in the range of 11 \nto 25 \u00b5g\/kg (Tam and Yao, 2002) and concentrations of PCBs (4.9 to 27.6 \u00b5g\/kg) \nwere reported from mangrove sediments at Mai Po marshes nature reserve in Hong \nKong (Zheng et al. 2000). However a more recent spatial assessment of PCB \npollution in China (n = 31) showed that waters from the Mingjiang estuary contained \n985 \u00b5g\/kg and that sediments in the Pearl River had PCB concentrations as high as 83 \n\u00b5g\/kg (Xing et al. 2005). Overall the concentrations of PCBs observed in this current \nwork are very low and according to published TEC values do not represent a risk to \nsediment dwelling organisms (Ingersoll et al. 2000; MacDonald et al. 2000).   \nThere are few studies of organic pollutants in mangrove sediments of Southern \nChina and there is a particular paucity of contaminant survey information from the \nIsland of Hainan. In combination the TPH (32,000 to 570,000 \u00b5g\/kg), PAH (24 \u00b5g\/kg \nto 238), PCB (2 to 6 \u00b5g\/kg) as well as Hg (<0.04 to 0.17 to mg\/kg) in the surface \nsediments from nine mangrove swamps indicate low pollution levels. The highest \npollutant loadings were detected from sites in Shenzhen and Xiamen confirming the \nhypothesis that mangroves in close proximity to urban\/industrial centers receive \ngreater hydrocarbon sourced pollution inputs than those adjacent to \n 12\nrural\/non-urbanized areas such as those on the Island of Hainan. Isomeric cross plots \nof diagnostic ratios for PAH confirmed this relationship and suggested \ncombustion-related PAH sources for the Xiamen and Shenzhen mangroves. \n None of the sediments analysed in this study exceeded published threshold \neffects concentration levels, suggesting that they would not harm sensitive biota or \nhumans; although the possibility that certain lipophilic pollutants could accumulate \nvia biomagnification at higher trophic levels cannot be entirely discounted. The low \namounts of anthropogenic organic pollutants from Haikou, Wengchang, Beihia and \nZhanjiang mangroves exposed what is most likely the combined natural biogenic and \naeolian transported background pollution as evidenced by elevated abundances of \nphenanthrene, perylene and naphthalene relative to other other PAH compounds. This \nobservation supports recently developed theories on the source and alteration of PAH \nin terrestrial soils from tropical and subtropical zones.   \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nC.H.
