To investigate women\u2019s corporate networks, and the reported benefits for the \nwomen and their employers. To gain insight into the motivation for these voluntary activities, by drawing on \norganisational citizenship theory. \nDesign\/methodology\/approach. We explored the issue using in-depth interviews with chairs and \norganisers of 12 women\u2019s networks, and triangulated the data with an email survey resulting in 164 \nresponses from network members in five companies.  \nFindings. We identify how networks were set up and managed, as well as the benefits that accrue to the \norganisation, the leaders and the members. Key findings were the wealth of voluntarily contributed extra-role \nbehaviours, and totally business-oriented view of the activities presented by network leaders. More senior \nwomen were more likely to report prosocial behaviours such as driving change and supporting others. \nOrganisational citizenship theory provided a lens through which to draw insight into actors\u2019 motivations for \nsupporting corporate networking. \nResearch limitations\/implications \nThis is a study of only 12 corporate networks within large UK companies, but findings should be useful for \nany employers or senior women thinking about starting or refreshing a corporate women\u2019s network. \nPractical Implications are that women and their employers appear to benefit strongly from being involved \nin corporate networking. Evidence suggests that employers should support internal women\u2019s networks, given \nthe organisational citizenship behaviours voluntarily contributed for their benefit.  \nWhat is original\/value of paper? This paper is the first to investigate how women\u2019s corporate networks are \norganised, and how their activities benefit not just the women but also the employer. Organisational \ncitizenship theory provides insight into motivation for such initiatives. The findings should be of interest not \njust for those involved in women-in-management studies, but also to organisational citizenship and \nnetworking researchers. \n \nKey words: Corporate networks; Organisational citizenship behaviour; Volunteering; Women. \n \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nAs lack of access to organisational networks is \nincreasingly seen as a barrier for women to reach \nthe top (Ragins, Townsend and Mattis, 1999; \nCatalyst and Opportunity Now, 2000), many \ncompanies are starting to support corporate \nnetworks for women. Vinnicombe and Colwill \n(1995) define networking as the banding together \nof like-minded people for the purposes of contact, \nfriendship and support. They describe such \nactivities as women\u2019s attempts to create for \nthemselves the support generated for men by their \ninformal same-sex grouping. However, there is \nlittle research about the nature of corporate \nwomen\u2019s networks, or the motivation of the women \ninvolved in organising or using them. A key feature \nof women\u2019s corporate networks is that they are \nusually managed by and for women volunteers. \nHence, women\u2019s involvement may be informed by \ntheories related to organisational citizenship \nbehaviour (OCB). Our research question is \n 2\ntherefore how are women\u2019s corporate networks \norganised, and what motivates the actors to get \ninvolved. \nThe aim of this paper is to report on how 12 \ncorporate networks were started in the UK, and \nexplore the motivations of those involved, before \nconsidering whether OCB theory contributes a \ndeeper understanding of those behaviours. We \ndescribe our methodology, before revealing how \nthe networks started, how they are managed, the \nactivities undertaken, and the benefits derived. We \ndiscuss the findings in relation to OCB theory, and \nconclude with consideration of the contribution to \nknowledge, the limitations of the study, and \nsuggestions for further research.  \nPREVIOUS RESEARCH \nThe importance of networking \nNetworking refers to activities by individuals \nattempting to develop and maintain relationships \nwith those with, or perceived to have, the potential \nto assist them in their work or career. Brass, \nGalaskiewicz, Greve and Tsai (2004) define \nnetworking as \u201ca set of nodes and the set of ties \nrepresenting some relationship, or lack of \nrelationship, between the nodes\u201d (p. 795), and \nsuggest that internal network ties, especially those \nbetween leaders, have a positive and significant \nimpact on unit and organisational performance \noutcomes. Successful networking can positively \ninfluence career outcomes such as increased job \nopportunities, job performance, income, \npromotions and career satisfaction, providing \naccess to information, gaining visibility, career \nadvice, social support, business leads, resources, \ncollaboration, strategy making, and professional \nsupport (Green, 1982). Luthans, Hodgetts and \nRosenkrantz (1988) found that a manager\u2019s ability \nto network was the strongest predictor of \nmanagerial success, ahead of their ability to \nundertake traditional management activities, \nroutine communication and human resource \nmanagement. Michael and Yukl (1993) examined \nthe networking behaviour of 247 managers, finding \nthat both internal and external networking were \nrelated to managers\u2019 rate of advancement in their \norganisation, confirming the findings of the Luthans \net al. study.  \nHence, networking is an important part of \nmanagerial behaviour and career success. \nDifferent types of networks have evolved \n(Vinnicombe and Colwill, 1995). Some are \nprofessional and occupational, such as those for \nwomen in engineering or finance. More recently, \ninternal corporate networks have emerged, \nsometimes started as informal gatherings of \nwomen, but developing into more formal networks \nsupported by the employer. A historical \nperspective on women\u2019s networking in the UK \npublic sector was recently published (McCarthy, \n2004). However, apart from the study by Catalyst \n(1999) described below, there is little published \nresearch on formal corporate networks for women. \nGender and networking behaviour \nThe research literature on individual networking \nand personal network configurations emphasises \nthe gendered nature of networking and networks in \nthe corporate world. In the USA, Ibarra (1992) \nfound gender differences in the networks of \nmanagers and the ways in which they were used. \nMen\u2019s networks were characterized by more high \nstatus individuals, and by more male members \nthan those of women with similar levels of \neducation and experience. Women tended to use \ntheir networks for social support, whilst men were \nmore instrumentally active to promote their \ncareers. Burke, Rothstein and Bristor (1995) \nreported similar findings in Canada. However, \nrecently, women may have become more aware of \nthe importance of networking to their careers, and \nsingle\/unattached women (in the USA) appear now \nto engage in these behaviours to a similar extent \nas males (Forret and Dougherty, 2001). The \nimplication is that women with family \nresponsibilities may remain at a serious \ndisadvantage, should out-of-hours socialising \nresult in important work-related outcomes (e.g. \nreceiving critical information or important job \nassignments).  \nPemberton, Stevens and Travers (1996) surveyed \n328 European Women\u2019s Management \nDevelopment network members who reported \njoining networks to help develop their personal \nskills, meet others who could help their careers, \nand make social contacts, rating psychosocial \nbenefits above career support. The paradox is that \nalthough research suggests that women may place \ngreater importance on the socialising aspects of \nnetworking, they are often excluded from social \nevents and workplace interactions in which men \nengage (McCarthy, 2004). Travers, Stevens and \nPemberton (1997) found that UK women sought \nand reportedly gained more career support from \ncolleagues and senior managers within their \nnetworks than did their counterparts in Europe and \nthe USA. UK women also seemed more interested \nin the self-development activities, and were \nnoticeably different in the greater emphasis placed \non the use of networks as an arena for developing \nself-confidence and networking skills. They \npreferred to engage in networks outside their \norganization. At that time, there were few \ncorporate women\u2019s networks for UK women and it \nappears that their networks were seen by \nmembers as a place to learn rather than as a place \n 3\nto do business. More recently, research by \nLinehan (2001) into European women and their \nnetworks reported that male managers spent more \ntime networking after work hours, difficult for \nwomen with family responsibilities. Although keen \nto take part in networks with women, Linehan\u2019s \ninterviewees believed that there were higher \nbenefits from networking in the established male-\ndominated networks, with closer access to power \nand resources. \nFormal corporate networks for women \nCatalyst (1999), a US-based research and \ncampaigning organisation conducted a study of \nwomen\u2019s corporate networks in the USA, finding \nthat women\u2019s networks were formed to address \nthree main problem areas. (1) Organisational \nenvironments were often more challenging for \nwomen than men. (2) Company social structures \nwere often designed in such a way that they \nexcluded and isolated women. (3) Established \ncareer paths sometimes excluded women, who did \nnot have the benefit of female role models. By \nnetworking with each other, women could share \ncareer development experiences and strategies, \nand learn from one another. This is the only \nprevious study identified which investigated \ncorporate networks for women. Further research is \nneeded to investigate the phenomenon now that \ncorporate networks are emerging as a popular tool \nfor change adopted by large companies across the \nworld. McCarthy (2004) examined the history of \nwomen\u2019s networks and undertook a practitioner \nstudy in UK public sector organisations, but we \nfound no academic research that investigated \nwomen\u2019s corporate networking behaviour. \nMotivation for women\u2019s participation in formal \nnetworks \nAs women and their employers set up corporate \nnetworks, the question arises as to their \nmotivation. The Catalyst study above identified the \nrationales for the introduction of networks, but did \nnot consider theoretical motives for such an \ninvestment. Following our report on best practice \nfor companies and for women interested in starting \nor running women\u2019s corporate networks \n(Vinnicombe, Singh and Kumra, 2004), we \nundertook further analysis of our data for evidence \nof the women\u2019s individual motivations for such \nbehaviour. From the literature on volunteering and \naltruism, we identified that the construct of \norganisational citizenship behaviour (OCB) might \nprovide useful theoretical insights into this \nphenomenon. \nTHEORETICAL PERSPECTIVE \u2013 \nORGANISATIONAL CITIZENSHIP BEHAVIOUR \nOrganisational citizenship behaviour (OCB) is \ndefined by Organ as \u201ccontributions to the \nmaintenance and enhancement of the social and \npsychological context that supports task \nperformance\u201d (Organ, 1997, p.91). OCB \ncomponents fall into seven types according to a \nreview of OCB-related studies (Podsakoff, P.M., \nMackenzie, S.B., Paine, J.B. and Bachrach, D.G. \n(2000). Helping behaviour involves voluntarily \nhelping others, with altruism as an antecedent. \nSportsmanship means maintaining positive \nattitudes and being willing to sacrifice own \ninterests for the organisation. Organisational \nloyalty means promoting a positive image to \noutsiders and maintaining loyalty. Organisational \ncompliance implies obeying company rules and \nprocedures, being a good employee and steward. \nIndividual initiative relates to acting and \nencouraging others to improve work outcomes. \nCivic virtue means taking part in the political \nmembership of the organisation, engaging in policy \nissues and monitoring on behalf of the community. \nSelf-development means the voluntary activities \nundertaken to improve oneself in terms of \nknowledge, skills and abilities to expand the \ncontribution to the organisation. \nThe acts of helping, sharing, giving, cooperating \nand volunteering are also part of the overlapping \nconstruct of prosocial organizational behaviour \n(Brief and Motowidlo, 1986), directed by an \norganisational member towards the welfare of an \nindividual, group or organisation, in addition to \ncarrying out the normal role duties. Volunteering is \nany activity in which time is given freely for the \nbenefit of others or for a cause, and \u201cis part of a \ncluster of helping behaviours entailing more \ncommitment than spontaneous assistance but \nnarrower in scope than the care provided to family \nand friends\u201d, according to Wilson (2000, p. 215). \nExchange theory sees volunteering as a rational \nsocial exchange, as people weigh up the costs and \nbenefits, especially when they have a stake in the \nactivity, and also if they expect to need help or \nhave been helped in the past and want to \nreciprocate. But the relationships between helpers \nand helped would be unequal and therefore a \nrational view would not be strong in explaining why \nhigher status women contribute their time and \nenergy to the network. Human and social capital \ntheories may provide a stronger explanation. The \nmost consistent predictor of volunteering is \neducation, as it heightens awareness, increases \nempathy and builds self-confidence. As \noccupational status increases, volunteering is also \nlikely to increase. As people grow older, they are \nalso more likely to volunteer as they have more \nsocial contacts, increasing the opportunities that \narise (Wilson, 2000). Social networks promote a \nsense of community and solidarity too. Gender \nalso impacts the likelihood of volunteering, as \nyoung men prefer to engage in individual voluntary \nefforts whilst young women prefer communal \n 4\nvoluntary activities (Gallagher, 1994). We will draw \non these theories for insight into the women\u2019s \nmotivations for their corporate networking \nbehaviours. \nMETHODOLOGY \nAs this was an exploratory study, a qualitative \napproach was considered appropriate for the main \npart of the study. First we identified a sample of \nprivate sector companies with good reputations for \ntheir women\u2019s networks, in collaboration with \nOpportunity Now, a UK organisation promoting \ngender equality. Six companies sponsored the \nresearch whilst six others offered access for the \nstudy. A key project aim was to write a guide for \norganisations seeking to set up women\u2019s networks \n(now published by Opportunity Now, see \nVinnicombe, Singh and Kumra, 2004). \nWe used semi-structured interviews, meeting the \nwomen who chaired and managed the women\u2019s \nnetworks. The interviews lasted about one and a \nhalf hours each, and were tape-recorded and \ntranscribed. Data were analysed using QSR NVivo \nto manage the process, and to develop an \nanalytical coding framework. Using an interpretive \napproach, we identified concepts, grouped similar \nconcepts, and constructed a hierarchy of themes \nsuch as network activities, with sub-nodes grouped \ninto business, career development and social \n(Lofland and Lofland, 1995). We also undertook a \nshort email survey of members. Our \nquestionnaires were circulated by five network \norganisers to 100 members with a letter from their \nnetwork chairs, to be returned by email directly to \nthe researchers at their academic institution to \npreserve anonymity. Quantitative data were \nanalysed using SPSS and Excel software, \nfrequencies and correlations were obtained, and \ncontent analysis undertaken of open-ended \nquestions. We received 164 usable responses, a \nresponse rate of 33% across the five networks \n(ranging from 16% to 71%), reasonable given that \nthe survey was undertaken during August. For this \npaper, we then re-analysed our data seeking out \nevidence of women\u2019s motivation for engagement in \nthe women\u2019s networks as organisers and as \nmembers. We identified a number of motivations \nand helping behaviours, and then examined the \nliterature on organisational citizenship behaviour to \nconstruct an appropriate coding framework for our \ninterview material and the members\u2019 responses to \nopen-ended questions in the email survey. \nINTERVIEW FINDINGS: THE 12 CORPORATE \nNETWORKS \nStarting the Corporate Networks \nThe networks all started as a result of growing \nawareness that women were not achieving their \nfull potential, and that lack of access to male-\ndominated senior networks might be a barrier \nwhich could be tackled by direct action. Seven \nwere started by women, the earliest in 1986 by a \ngroup of women in BT after attending a women\u2019s \ndevelopment course. Lloyds-TSB\u2019s network came \nas the result of one woman\u2019s efforts in 1999. She \nmade a business case to the board, and set up a \nnational steering committee, and the deputy chief \nexecutive of the company became the sponsor of \nthe network. Two networks (Citigroup and IBM) \nstarted in 2000 and 2001 after women who \nattended European women\u2019s conferences went \nback to their companies to set up UK networks, \nand have since expanded internationally. Also in \n2000, a group of women at UBS decided they \nwanted to make a difference for women\u2019s careers \nin their company, and set up their network that has \nsince been rolled out internationally. In 2001, \nseveral senior Shell women got together \ninformally, met regularly to discuss issues \nconcerning women\u2019s careers, and gradually \nformalised themselves into a corporate network \nnow stretching around the world. Senior women \nstarted Barclays\u2019 network as a result of a work\/life \nbalance initiative in 2002. Two networks were \nstarted by senior males, chief executive Jack \nWelch being responsible for the initiation at GE in \n1997. In 2001, the UK chairman of Deutsche Bank \nsuggested emulating the popular \u201cWomen on Wall \nStreet\u201d network of their US branch. The remaining \nthree networks were set up jointly by companies \nand senior women. Ford\u2019s network was set up in \n1999, after the business needs for such action \nwere identified. This was followed by Goldman \nSachs in 2001 as part of their global leadership \nand diversity initiative, and in 2002, by PwC as the \ncompany recognised that few women were \nadvancing to senior levels and set up a focus \ngroup to identify an action plan and become the \nsteering committee of the new network.  \nManaging the Networks \nMembership Issues \nAt the outset, there were a number of issues to \nconsider regarding membership. Who were the \nintended members, how could they be supported, \nand how could they be accessed? Should the \nnetwork be just for women, and if so, should it be \nuniversal membership or segmented in some way. \nShould it be elitist and just for senior women, or \ngraduate women? Should it be national or regional, \nshould it be international and global?  Should all \nwomen employees automatically be members, or \nshould they have to register to become members? \nThese were important decisions to be made. Most \nnetworks welcomed male members but only after \nthe networks were up and running. But there was a \nstrong argument for involving men, as the Ford \ndiversity director commented, \u201cYou need to make \n 5\nthe networks inclusive because you need to raise \nawareness amongst men about issues that affect \nwomen\u201d. Naming the network was an important \nstep, usually the company name and \u201cwomen\u2019s \nnetwork\u201d as the title at first. Whilst IBM chose \n\u201cWomen in Blue\u201d, several networks changed \nnames after a while to become more inclusive, for \nexample, UBS called its network \u201cAll Bar None\u201d, \nplaying on the name of a city pub chain, All Bar \nOne. \nStrategic Planning and Leadership \nMost networks in the first couple of years drew up \nconstitutions, defined roles and responsibilities, set \nup voting systems, designed vision and mission \nstatements and produced broader strategy \ndocuments. For example, at BT, the mission was \n\u201cto become a dynamic professional organization \ncommitted to the continued progression of women \nin BT\u201d, and their strategy was \u201cto grow the \ninfluence and reach of the network, extend the \ndevelopment opportunities open to members, raise \nour profile within BT, and take the role of \nambassador on women\u2019s issues throughout BT\u201d. \nAt Goldman Sachs, the mission was \u201cto recruit, \nretain and develop women professionals, and to \nincrease their representation at senior levels\u201d. That \nmission was supported by a statement of purpose, \nwhich was then expanded in alignment with their \nEuropean network, to facilitate network activities \nacross the various country networks to achieve \ntheir goals. Planning was seen as a critical activity. \nNetwork leaders suggested that the steering group \nshould have an away-day for team building and to \nget away from the day job, to focus how to best \nmanage the agenda within their resources. All the \nnetworks set their own agendas, usually organized \nthrough the committee. Most of them canvassed \nmembers for areas of interest so that future events \ncould meet their members\u2019 real needs. Most \nnetwork committees met monthly, and a few met \nquarterly. Since the network leader often attended \nsatellite meetings as well as committee meetings, \nthere appeared to be an excessive number of \nmeetings for some leaders. As networks became \nestablished, initial structures needed to be \nreviewed. Communication systems also needed to \nbe designed, increasingly undertaken through the \nintranets. \nNetwork leaders agreed that structure and \nhierarchy were essential and they set up a number \nof structures to organise their activities. Typical of \nsteering groups, the Shell UK women\u2019s network \ncommittee consisted of a president, vice-president, \ntreasurer, and then members with roles related to \nlearning and development, mentoring, recognition, \ncommunication and social activities. At Barclays, \nthe committee members fell into natural roles after \na few meetings, for example, the good coordinator, \nthe women with training backgrounds \u2013 and they \ndecided to work on events or activities in pairs, \nwhich made things much easier when someone \nwas unable for some reason to put the time in, or \nwhen someone left. Organisers emphasised the \nneed to get the right women involved as leaders, \nwho were willing and able to put in a sustained \neffort. It was seen as a huge task for volunteers, \nwho might burn out after a long period of \ndedication and commitment. One chair \ncommented: \u201cWe went through a dip, where \npeople were dropping out or couldn\u2019t commit.\u201d \nFeelings of unfairness also emerged: \u201cDifferent \npeople at different times have felt like they\u2019re \ntaking an unfair share of the load.\u201d The next \ncomment reveals that real passion is needed to \nsustain the network once the initial enthusiasm and \nelation of a successful start-up has gone by. \u201cAs \nwe\u2019ve come up to our first year\u2019s anniversary, \nwe\u2019ve had to think how shall we do the rolling on, \nrolling off? So we as a steering group agreed that \na third of us would roll off each year, and sign up a \nthird of new people.\u201d Indeed, the term \u201cpassion\u201d for \nthe network\u2019s goals was mentioned in seven of the \n12 interviews.  \nAt GE and Citigroup, there was a rotating \nleadership. Recognising the need for renewal of \nleadership, a formal process was instigated at BT \nfor electing a chair, with tenure set for two years. \nTheir network advertised all committee positions \ninternally and interviewed potential candidates. \nThis attracted high quality candidates, and gave \nthe position more status. Some networks called the \nleader \u2018president\u2019, especially those with \nheadquarters based in the US, whilst others \npreferred \u2018chair\u2019. Naming the executive team \nappropriately was important too. In one company, \nthe US network committee was called the \n\u201cCabinet\u201d but the UK branch decided to choose \n\u201cExecutive Board\u201d instead, thereby avoiding likely \n\u2018kitchen cabinet\u2019 comments.  \nSome network chairs said that it was important to \nidentify what the networks were NOT about. The \nGE network chair commented: \u201cWhat it\u2019s not is a \nsubstitute for superb HR practices, but it is a group \nthat is determined to do its own bit, to research \nreasons why the pipeline doesn\u2019t work as well as it \nshould, and the reasons why we don\u2019t actually \nhave women at senior level.\u201d Similarly, the \nBarclays network organisers decided that they \nwere not going to be trainers, even though they \nhad or could have developed such skills. Training \nwas seen as an activity for HR and the corporate \nuniversity, but the network would facilitate requests \nfrom network members. They also decided that it \nwould be more effective for networking if they \ntackled issues not in divisional silos but as themes \nacross the various divisions, bringing women and \nmen together from different parts of the \norganization. \n 6\nResources \nFive networks obtained funding from central \ndiversity budgets, four from HR, and three from the \nbusiness areas. Most networks had to bid for their \nfunds, making a business case for whatever they \nwanted to do. Initial budgets were often very small, \nwith no certainty of continuity, so prudent budget \nmanagement was essential. Network leaders were \nproactive in seeking sponsorship from business \nareas for their events, for speaker costs, and for \ntravel for women members. Generally women \nmembers had to persuade managers to support \ntheir attendance at conferences and other events. \nAnnual budgets varied by size of companies, their \nprofitability and the kinds of activities that budgets \nwere intended to support, from \u00a35,000 to \u00a3120,000 \nper year, with separate funding for very large \nconferences. Sometimes secretarial and office \nsupport had to come out of these funds, whilst \nelsewhere, these were funded separately or just \ndone by volunteers, including secretaries of \nnetwork leaders.  \nSenior sponsors were seen as key to the success \nof women\u2019s networks, as they played a symbolic \nrole in emphasising the added value to the \nbusiness contributed by the women leaders and \nmembers. But it was often a two way process \u2013 \none director of business banking strongly \nsupported the women\u2019s network \u2013 at the same time \nengaging the women in a drive to recruit more \nfemale business banking managers and create \nnew opportunities, products and services to attract \nand secure female clients. Senior women in \nparticular took on a lot of work for the network, in \naddition to their usual demanding jobs. As \nspeakers, they were often inspiring, \u201cjust speaking \nfrom the heart\u201d, as described by Citigroup\u2019s chair. \nThe GE chair spoke of \u201ca core group of senior \nwomen who do feel passionately that this is \nsomething that\u2019s important to the company, and \nthey have in their own time kept up the drive.\u201d But \nnot all senior women want to support women\u2019s \nnetworks, although sometimes their bosses take a \ndifferent view. The IBM (UK) CEO, Larry Hirst, \nreportedly insists that senior women executives \nhave a responsibility to develop and support other \nfemale talent. Accessing resources is not a \nstraightforward task, but requires continual \nattention and effort from the network leaders. \nVoluntary Nature of Network \nThe voluntary nature of the women\u2019s network led \nto a variety of challenges. There were indications \nof tension about lack of recognition from line \nmanagement about the contribution made by the \nnetwork leaders, much of which was undertaken in \ntheir own (unpaid) time. Some network leaders \nsought to formalise their efforts by aligning their \nobjectives directly with those of the company, \ngaining recognition at appraisals for reaching those \nobjectives. In contrast, others felt that assessment \nof their network leadership activities was not \nappropriate. One chair said: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s \ncorrect to give people recognition through setting \nobjectives when it\u2019s a voluntary organisation.\u201d One \nnetwork leader had to take annual leave in order to \nbe able to run a network event. Another reported \nthat she had 114 emails still to be answered in her \nwomen\u2019s network email box after working through \nthem all weekend. Another challenge was that \npotential volunteers needed to be informed about \nthe amount of work involved, before being asked to \ncommit themselves. \u201cWe had to work out what new \npeople were signing up to, so everybody in the \nsteering group signed up to certain things\u201d, said \none network leader. Another said: \u201cIt is exhausting. \nTo be honest, if I had a family or anything else, or \neven a boyfriend for that matter, I couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d \nBusiness Focus \n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a talk shop.\u201d Network leaders felt they \nhad to get rid of the myth that it was about \u201cknitting \nand childcare arrangements.\u201d This was a key issue \nfor network leaders, as they strove to be seen as \nrunning a worthwhile business activity. There was \nalmost over-compensation for the criticism \nencountered from some males, that this is a \nwomen\u2019s group activity where \u201cthey gossip or do \ntrivial things\u201d. Network managers and chairs did \neverything possible to put the activity on a sound \nbusiness footing. Some networks \u201cbought in\u201d quite \nformally to the company objectives. Citigroup\u2019s \nwomen\u2019s network set up 100-day task teams to \ntake up issues and produce results. \u201cWhat we\u2019re \ntrying to do is to be seen as part of the \ninfrastructure of the company as opposed to a \nlobbying group. We\u2019re trying to be included in the \ndecision-making process and the business \nmanagement process.\u201d The Ford networks had a \nbalanced scorecard that fitted with the aims of the \nbusiness. There was also a strong sense of the \nneed for added value \u2013 the network leaders were \nconstantly evaluating what they had achieved, and \nwhat better ways there might be to reach out to \nmore women and achieve more business benefits \nfrom the investment made by the company. \nThe Activities of the Networks \nActivities for the company  \nInvolvement in HR and diversity activities  \nNetworks were all involved with HR activities. \nCitigroup women leaders had worked to bring the \nnetwork even closer to HR, as they worked on HR \nobjectives concerning talent management. \nRecruitment was another area where most of the \nwomen\u2019s network leaders worked actively with HR, \nat schools and university job fairs, in particular for \ntechnically qualified women in IBM and Ford. \nFord\u2019s women\u2019s network worked with HR on the \nbusiness benefits of a longer paid maternity leave. \n 7\nGoldman Sachs women\u2019s network ran sessions for \nundergraduate women to demystify the company \nand industry. Barclays ran an internal careers fair \nwith HR. BT\u2019s network ran a job-share register to \nhelp women members find job partners. There was \nalso involvement in diversity initiatives, such as \nFord\u2019s work\/life balance week. Some network \nleaders fed back to HR the needs identified by \nmembers, challenging whether such needs were \nalready being addressed, e.g. by general \nmentoring programmes, and backing up their \nfeedback with statistics on where women were \nmeeting blockages, such as in promotions.  \nInvolvement in marketing, new product \ndevelopment and PR  \nSome companies used their women\u2019s networks as \nsources of female opinion on new products and \nservices. Ford\u2019s women\u2019s marketing panel \nsuggested colour coding car dipsticks to make \nthem easier to see. The women also advised on \nthe design of cars for pregnant women and for \nbetter access to baby seats. Some of these \nactivities were undertaken in work time. The \nwomen\u2019s involvement brought recognition by the \nmale engineers: \u201cAcross the organisation, men are \nfeeling that the women\u2019s networks are having \nbeneficial effects for the organisation as a whole.\u201d \nIn Goldman Sachs, the women\u2019s network \norganised Ascend, a special event for 180 key \nwomen clients, with a theme of \u2018leading in a world \nof change\u2019, focused on business issues. Feedback \nfrom attendees indicated that it made them feel \nthey wanted to do business with a company that \nwas so forward-looking in the way it dealt with its \nfemale clients. In IBM, networks were often \nmentioned when the company was bidding for \nbusiness, and similarly, PwC reported its support \nfor the women\u2019s network when bidding for public \nsector work. So the women\u2019s networks helped \nthese companies improve their products, image, \nreputation and business as socially responsible \nemployers and producers.  \nEnhancing women\u2019s business understanding  \nWomen were keen to understand the core \nbusiness of the company, and several women\u2019s \nnetworks invited senior executives to speak and \nanswer the women\u2019s questions. In particular, \nwomen\u2019s networks in the technology companies \nsuch as BT and IBM invited senior managers to \nprovide sessions to keep the women up-to-date \nabout the new technological developments likely to \nimpact the company and their jobs.  \nLeveraging best practice from the networks \nThe women\u2019s networks were run on a very \nbusiness-like basis, and a key part of this was to \nleverage best practice from other women\u2019s \nnetworks within the company, often based in the \nUSA, and share best practice with other diversity \nnetworks (e.g. gay and lesbian networks), and \nexternally with networks in other companies, as for \nexample, IBM and Ford often held joint events. \nSome network programme initiatives were \ndeveloped into tailored courses for all senior \nexecutives, following successful roll-out by the \nwomen\u2019s network. \nCareer development activities  \nConferences  \nMuch energy went into organising network \nconferences, at regional, national, European and \nglobal levels. Often, a conference was the very first \nformal activity of a new women\u2019s network, to bring \npeople together to understand what was needed. \nGE\u2019s network ran an annual European meeting for \nwomen. Shell\u2019s network organisers asked their \nsponsors to attend their conferences, not just as \nspeakers but as listeners, to network with the \nwomen and listen to their stories. Deutsche Bank\u2019s \nannual conference was different in that it was a \nlarge, free annual event attracting nearly one \nthousand women including 50% external \nattendees. They followed the \u2018by invitation only\u2019 \nmodel set by their Frankfurt and New York \n(Women on Wall Street) conferences, to contribute \ntowards building a business community that \nsupported and valued women, at the same time \nenhancing the company\u2019s reputation.  \nCareer development events \nAll the networks ran career development events. In \nBarclays, women were most interested in issues \nsuch as career barriers, networking, \ncommunication, understanding body language, \nassertiveness, applying for jobs, preparing for \ninterviews and work\/life balance. The most popular \nevent was A Day in the Life of a Director, which \nattracted a lot of males, who were very visible in \nasking questions from the floor. BT had its own \nnetwork training programme, Careering Ahead, \nwhich it developed into a set of modules, which \ncould be run for different geographical groups. A \npopular new session on voice, using a Globe \nTheatre coach, ran at a weekend so that more \npeople could attend. Citigroup set up a career \ndevelopment taskforce, which resulted in a one-\nyear development programme for 50 women. At \nthe end, the women were asked to reflect back on \ntheir careers, their aspirations, and the feedback \nreceived from their informal mentors, which helped \nthem to draw up a better-informed route map for \ntheir future careers. Shell\u2019s network had sessions \non understanding about how to get on in Shell and \nhow talent was developed. One innovatively-titled \nsession on Moving from Can I? to I Can! focusing \non confidence-building and assertiveness was \nseen as particularly useful for \u201cthe women waiting \nfor the green light\u201d to seek career advancement.  \nBreakfast, lunch and dinner events for senior \nwomen were held by some networks, as part of \n 8\nefforts to increase exposure of the senior women \nto those in leadership positions. GE was an \nexcellent example. In BT, the chairman hosted a \nbusiness breakfast for 60 senior women, to talk \nabout boardroom skills. UBS had networking \nlunches for women associate directors and above, \neach taking up a theme such as tackling conflict \neffectively, career advancement, making \nperformance measurement work for the individual, \nand work\/life balance.  \nSeveral networks organised mentoring, either \nthrough formal programmes or less formally. \nCitigroup preferred the term \u201csponsor\u201d, rather than \nmentor, when they launched a one-year \nprogramme for 50 women identified as emerging \ntalent, but sponsors were also asked to be \ncoaches. In PwC, the mentoring scheme started \nwith partners and directors mentoring women \nmanagers in London, with plans for expansion of \nthe scheme across more remote locations, using \nemail and web, as well as mentoring of both \nwomen and men, improving career support across \nthe company.  \nPersonal and Social Activities  \nSeveral networks organised sessions on well-\nbeing, work\/life balance and women\u2019s health. IBM \nwomen\u2019s network ran a \u2018Bring your child to work \nday\u2019 which was very positively received, a new \nslant on the more usual daughters\u2019 day model. \nSeveral networks supported charities directly, one \ntargeting their diversity award prize-money to a \nwomen\u2019s refuge, another supporting a women\u2019s \nrefuge both financially and by equipping and \nredecorating houses and persuading other \ncompanies to supply them with painting materials, \nlinen and toys etc, whilst a third network collected \nsecond hand good quality business suits to help \ndisadvantaged women going for interviews. Only a \nfew women\u2019s network activities were purely social. \nOne network persuaded a famous London store to \nstay open for a Christmas shopping evening for \nnetwork members. Two networks ran popular \nwine-tasting events, whilst others ran fun and \nsports days for members\u2019 families, and one \norganised a drinks reception and private viewing at \nthe Tate Modern art gallery, inviting women \nmembers in recognition of their contribution to the \nnetworks\u2019 activities. \nNetwork Leaders\u2019 Views of Impact of Women\u2019s \nNetworks  \nWhilst it was clear that the original objectives were \nto focus on facilitating women\u2019s careers, the \npressure from the business (implemented in terms \nof control of budget and support) meant that most \nnetworks leaders focused on the business \nobjectives.  Hence when questioned about the \nvalue of the network, they tended to respond with \nthe business case, rather than the specific benefits \nfor women. Most network leaders mentioned the \npositive impact on retention. Some specified \nrecruitment and better talent management, as well \nas better communication flows across divisions, \nand integration of women, leading to increased \ncommitment, which again should impact retention. \nWith women keen to improve themselves, the \ncompanies gained a better-equipped workforce. \nThere would be more organisational learning, as \nsenior executives acquired experience of coaching \nand mentoring women as well as men. The \ncompanies benefited from enhanced reputation, \nwith more female role models - a good place for \nwomen to work, a culture where flexibility is \nsupported for women and men. Other important \nbenefits for the companies included use of the \nnetworks by new product development groups to \ndesign products and services that met the needs of \nwomen consumers, and by involvement of the \nnetwork in diversity and HR initiatives.  \nHaving senior women role models was seen as a \nkey benefit for women by network leaders, \u201cso that \nrole models were a bit closer to reality\u201d, and \u201cmore \ndoable, that\u2019s a goal I can see\u201d. In PWC, the \nemphasis was on profiling some very senior \nwomen, including part-timers, to dispel the myth \u2013 \n\u201cmost people don\u2019t realise we have partners who \nhave been promoted who are part-time, because \nmost people think you can\u2019t do it.\u201d In addition, \nwomen benefited from personal development, \ngreater visibility and voice, and chance to develop \ntheir careers. \u201cThey like the chance to network with \npeople they wouldn\u2019t have otherwise met. Some of \nthe women who attend those probably aren\u2019t \ninvited to any event because of the job they do.\u201d \nTheir expanded personal networks enabled them \nto do their job better, as well as glean more \ninformation about job and career opportunities, as \none leader commented: \u201cI know of a couple of \nsituations where women have moved jobs directly \nas a result of the network.\u201d The increased social \ncontacts reportedly led to more satisfaction with \ntheir careers and jobs, and a sense of being in a \nmore inclusive and supportive work culture, which \nshould lead to increased retention of qualified and \nmotivated women.  \nNetwork leaders also reported getting a lot out of \nrunning the networks. \u201cBeing involved with the \nnetwork gives you an enormous lift and your ability \nto affect the environment, if you believe strongly in \nsomething as obviously the volunteers do, makes \nyou feel you can influence the development of the \norganisation.\u201d Another commented: \u201cYou also get \nto expand your network not just with other women, \nbut with the most senior management of the \norganisation, and they get a different perspective \non you and your abilities and talents than they \nwould just knowing you through your specific job.\u201d \n 9\nMeasures of Success \nIt was important to network organizers that they \nregularly considered what they were achieving, \nand how they were communicating that success, \nsometimes reviewing this annually, sometimes \nmore frequently. \u201cI think we\u2019re still not getting \neveryone to understand how we deliver on the \nmission\u201d. It was not only promoting their success to \nthe company, but also considering where they had \nnot succeeded. \u201cWe try to understand why women \naren\u2019t supporting it\u201d, and used feedback to design \nnew offerings, for example \u201cbite-sized chunks of \nlarger events\u201d so that other women could tap in. \nThe PwC network leaders were very pleased that \ntheir network was mentioned in the company\u2019s \nannual report. For the Barclays network, getting \nthe diversity award from the chairman was \nconfirmation of positive regard for the network, and \nit had a big impact on general awareness of its \nexistence, as such public and senior endorsement \nhelped make line managers more willing to support \nit.  \nSo what were the measures of success? There \nwere many ways in which network performance \nwas evaluated, some very obvious and easy to \nmeasure such as the number of members and \nevents held and some less tangible impacts, such \nas cultural change in the organisation. Some \ncompanies had gone so far as to integrate the \nnetwork\u2019s activities into a balanced scorecard, so \nthat there was harmonization with measures of HR \neffectiveness. Some difficulties with measurement \nwere reported, especially relating to the \norganizational level impact. Where there was lack \nof integration of HR data systems across various \ndivisions, progress of women into management \nlevels could not be systematically charted for the \nwhole company, and it was difficult to attribute \nthose women\u2019s successes to the women\u2019s network \nactivity. There were also pressures for short-term \nmeasures: \u201cPeople do have very short time scales \nand I think sometimes they\u2019re not as prepared or \nable to see the long term benefits\u201d. Nonetheless, \nmeasures were seen as important, especially in \nthe early stages. \u201cYou have got to have something \nthat in the early days makes people feel that they \nare achieving.\u201d Network organisers emphasised \nthe need for measures to be meaningful to the \nstakeholders, whether they were the women\u2019s \nnetwork organizers, members, senior sponsors or \ncompany funders such as HR and Diversity. The \nmeasures reported by our sample are given in \nTable 1. \n \n \nTable I: Measures of Network Success \nMembership Membership numbers, meeting targets for membership, advocacy for membership, number of \nsatellite networks launched \nEvents Number of events including training days; attendance, feedback, interest in repeat and new \nevents \nWomen \nMembers \nImpact on women\u2019s behaviour; impact on women\u2019s achievements; impact on confidence \nOther \nActivities \nSurveys of members, success stories of women achieving; number of mentoring relationships \nestablished; number of website hits, books\/training materials taken out.

Senior managers wanting more involvement with Network. Line \nmanagement participation in\/support for the Network. Cultural change. \n \n \n \n \nChallenges and advice \nThe network chairs and organizers had strong \nviews about the challenges facing them. These \ncould be grouped as issues around sustainability, \nnetwork activities and the corporate culture. They \nsaw the biggest challenge as the workload for the \nvolunteer women chairs and organizers, as they \ngrapple with senior jobs and often have family \nresponsibilities too, so women leaders frequently \nsuffer from burnout. As the network gets up and \nrunning, the entrepreneurial skills of the founders \nare not so relevant for the next phase of settling \ndown, so different skills are needed. Accessing \nresources is still a problem after start-up, there is a \nneed to deal with change as senior champions \nleave, and new champions have to be approached. \nSuccession planning of network leadership has to \nbe tackled but engaging senior women is \nsometimes an additional challenge. There was a \nstrong view that ownership of the network needs to \nbe maintained by the women. \n 2\nManaging the network activities and starting new \ninitiatives were seen as challenging, as being \nsuccessful led to more work and higher \nexpectations. The network organisers felt pressure \nto keep the activities business-focused, to ensure \nbusiness benefits. The fit of the network activities \nwith other structures, such as HR and diversity \ndepartments, was also challenging. The other big \nissue was the persistence of the male-dominated \ncorporate culture, which still made it difficult for \nwomen to succeed. Men often trivialised the \nwomen\u2019s network (witches\u2019 coven, knitting circles, \nbra-burning, girl power, sisterhood), with some \ncomplaining that the network was a form of \npositive discrimination. The challenge was to \nengage the senior men and the male line \nmanagers in delivering change, so that more \nfemale role models could emerge.  \nAt the end of the interviews, we asked networks \norganisers what advice they would personally want \nto give women setting up networks. The key \nmessage was the need to identify and gain support \nfrom key individuals. Next highest priorities were to \ndefine the aims and objectives and to plan the \nagenda, as well as sort out a budget. Other \nimportant advice included getting a good \ncommunication system, recognising what a \nchallenge it is for the leaders of the network, given \nthe voluntary nature of the endeavour, and \nunderstanding the fit with corporate strategy. \nFinally we asked network organisers for assistance \nin surveying network members to get their views \non their favourite events, the benefits of \nmembership and their motivations for membership \nof the network. The survey results are reported in \nthe next section. \nSurvey of network members \nDemographics  \nWe had a response rate of 33%. The average age \nof the 164 respondents was 36, ranging from 21 to \n58, but most were in their 30s and 40s. On ethnic \nbackground, 19 (11.5%) reported themselves as \nnon-white, with the largest sub-group (3%) coming \nfrom India or Pakistan, 2% from the Far East, 1% \nwere Afro-Caribbean and 5% came from other or \nmixed ethnic backgrounds. Only two reported \nbeing disabled. The average job tenure was 8 \nyears, and the average network membership was \njust under two years. An overwhelming majority \n(90%) worked full-time. Membership was spread \nacross different self-reported levels, with 38% \njunior or professional staff, 46% in middle \nmanagement and 16% in senior positions. On \naverage, members had attended three events in \nthe last year, but a fifth had attended none, whilst \n10% had attended ten or more events, particularly \nthose in a city-based network that organised most \nof its events at lunchtimes. \nBenefits reported by Women Members \nThe most frequently mentioned benefit in the \nsurvey was an expanded network, providing \nevidence that networks were indeed meeting their \nobjectives. Members seemed to really appreciate \nnetworking with other women, perhaps because of \nthe limited opportunities to meet female colleagues \non a regular basis in some male-dominated parts \nof the businesses. \n\u201cGetting to know other women in the company \nand the chance for them to get to know of my \nexistence (especially the senior ones).\u201d \n\u201cExtended my network of people I know here in \nX. I am now a member of the steering \ncommittee\u201d. \n\u201cContacts and a better understanding of the \nissues.\u201d \n\u201cA large network of mainly female \ncolleagues from all areas of technology.\u201d \nCareer development and advice opportunities were \nalso seen as key personal benefits. It was not just \nthe content of network events that was considered \nbeneficial, but also the opportunity for visibility with \nsenior executives, and for some, the opportunity to \ncommence valuable mentoring relationships. \n\u201cHave met a variety of people across the \nfirm, attended some informative \npresentations on how to make the best of \nmy career.\u201d \n\u201cIt has been a great networking experience \nand I have had exposure to people \nthroughout the division that I would not \nnormally have had, as well as exposure to \nmeeting very senior people.  The chance to \norganise some high profile events \npersonally, which I probably wouldn\u2019t have \ndone if I had not been a member.\u201d \n\u201cGreat mentors that have been really \nsupportive, and I have met a lot more senior \npeople than I would have otherwise.\u201d \n\u201cI have built a network. I recently changed roles \ninto a high profile position and two of the people \non the interviewing list were women I had met \nthrough the women\u2019s network.  This was a \nmassive advantage as I felt much more at ease \nand confident, and I think I performed to my best \nat interview.\u201d \nAnother advantage to emerge from membership of \nthe network involved the opportunity to promote \ndiversity and issues relating to women employees.  \nThis was felt to be of great benefit, both personally \nand for junior colleagues.  \n\u201cThe opportunity to meet a broad spectrum \nof people across the firm. Get involved in \nunderstanding the recruitment policies and \nactively work to promote diversity in the \nwork force.\u201d \n 3\n\u201cA wider network of contacts, awareness of \nthe challenges other women face and those \nwe have in common.\u201d \n\u201cHelpful to understand that other women \nface similar issues at work, and discuss how \nthey cope with specific situations, e.g. part-\ntime working, childcare. Good to have \nexamples of successful women who are in \nsenior positions whilst managing a \nreasonable work\/life balance. Interesting to \nsee data on women\u2019s job levels\/salaries \ncompared to men, and therefore understand \nthat proactive work is required sometimes. If \nyou don\u2019t ask, you don\u2019t get.\u201d \n\u201cUseful network of contacts. New ideas. Ability to \nhelp some other women in the company.\u201d \nWhen we asked members what they valued most, \nthey reported that the network\u2019s greatest benefit \nwas the opportunity it afforded for gaining \nfriendship and support in the organisation, and \ncontributing to changing the culture too.  \n\u201cI feel much more supported when issues \ncome up which appear to be discriminatory.\u201d \n \u201cFeeling like there is a support network out \nthere and that there are other people with \nthe same issues I have.\u201d \n\u201cThe knowledge that I am not on my own.\u201d \n\u201cNice to recognise people around the \nbuilding, it makes work a more friendly \nenvironment. Personal satisfaction when \npeople report benefits from my \ncoaching\/mentoring support. Recognition \nregarding my involvement in organising \nnetwork.\u201d \nHowever, network membership had not been so \npositive for everyone. Some had been unable to \nattend events due to long working hours, outside \ncommitments or distant locations, and they \nexpressed a sense of frustration that they were \nunable to avail themselves of what could be a \nvaluable career resource. A few felt a lack of \nidentification with the network\u2019s aims and \nobjectives. \u201cI would be the first person to object to \nmen having their own network, so I would feel \nhypocritical attending one of these events. A lot of \nmy friends attend and get a lot out of them, so I am \nnot objecting to them per se. I personally don\u2019t \nwant to attend.\u201d Others revealed cynicism that the \nnetwork was used politically to advance individual \ncareer agendas, and that the network \u201clacked \nclout\u201d to really make a difference.  \nMotivation to Join the Networks \nFollowing a content analysis of open-ended \nresponses on motivation to engage with the \nnetwork, four constructs were identified. Wanting \nto drive change, support others and share \nexperiences were coded as prosocial motivation. \nGaining support, information, mentors, role \nmodels, meeting senior women, networking, \nimproving career prospects, learning and \ndevelopment were coded as career motivation. \nBetter understanding of the business and getting \nbusiness contacts across the company were coded \nas business-oriented motivation. Wanting to meet \nother women (without specifying why) was coded \nas social motivation.  \n \nTable II: Inter-Correlations of Motivation Constructs, Age and Job Level \nMotivation Construct N = 164 Career Business Prosocial Social Job Level Age\nCareer motivation Pearson correlation \nSig (2-tailed) \n1      \nBusiness orientation Pearson correlation \nSig (2-tailed) \n.105 \n.180 \n1     \nProsocial motivation Pearson correlation \nSig (2-tailed) \n.057 \n.470 \n-0.004 \n.955 \n1    \nSocial motivation Pearson correlation \nSig (2-tailed) \n.342***\n.000 \n-.109 \n.163 \n.203** \n.009 \n1   \nJob Level Pearson correlation \nSig (2-tailed) \n.075 \n.344 \n.004 \n.958 \n.153 \n.052* \n.017 \n.826 \n1  \nAge Pearson correlation \nSig (2-tailed) \n-.078 \n.324 \n-.067 \n.394 \n.038 \n.627 \n-.127 \n.108 \n.525*** \n.000 \n1 \n*** Correlation is significant at the 0.001 level (2-tailed) \n**  Correlation is significant at the 0.01 level (2-tailed) \n*    Correlation is significant at the 0.1 level (2-tailed) \n \n \n 1\nTable II shows that younger members were \nsomewhat more likely to report career, business \nand social motivations for membership, whilst \nmiddle and senior members were significantly (but \nonly marginally) more likely to have a prosocial \nmotivation than juniors and professionals. Social \nand prosocial constructs were significantly \ncorrelated. There were no differences between full-\ntime and part-time women, nor on ethnicity. \nA number of the responses indicated good \norganizational citizenship behaviours. Several \nsenior women made the specific point that they \nwished to help more junior colleagues, as well as \nhelping to engage women in the organisation, \nthereby assisting in recruitment and retention of \nwomen in male-dominated functions, e.g. \ntechnology. \n\u201cI am in the team that provides women\u2019s \nnetworking facilities and felt it would \nencourage the junior technical women to \nremain in technical careers rather than \nmoving into management in order to \nadvance in their careers.\u201d \n\u201cTo help through my experience and position \nto address some of the challenges facing \nwomen in the company, and to get to know \nmore women in the company.\u201d \n\u201cI helped set it up, initially to have a support \nnetwork for women as there were so few in \nIT, but also to help recruit and retain \nwomen.\u201d \n\u201cI wished to support junior colleagues to develop \ntheir careers.\u201d \nWomen at all levels mentioned wanting to support \nothers and to share experiences, so that these \ncould be understood without internalising problems \nand unduly blaming themselves when they came \nup against hurdles or didn\u2019t succeed. To discuss \nthese with others, and gain some support and \nunderstanding on what they were experiencing \nwas felt to be a valuable function of the network. \n\u201cTo promote my own experiences and share \nwith others the benefits [my company] offers \nwhich I have been involved with, e.g. part-\ntime work, as a mother of three.\u201d \n\u201cI view it as a community in this company, \nand I expected to share experiences \nbetween us.\u201d \n\u201cTo make contacts with other members in \nthe network and to support the issues faced \nby women in the workplace, as otherwise, \nwe would have no voice.\u201d \n\u201cTo extend my network across the organisation. \nTo help drive positive changes that will increase \nthe representation of women in management. To \nshare and learn with colleagues through \ndiscussions on career\/gender related issues.\u201d \nThese responses indicate that the sharing and \nlearning was seen as a two way process that could \nhelp to change the culture and create a more \nsupportive environment for women\u2019s careers to \ndevelop. \n \nFigure 1: Women\u2019s Corporate Networking and \nOCBs \n \nThe 7 Components of Organisational Citizenship \nBehaviour\n\u2022 Helping \u2013 volunteering, altruism\n\u2022 Sportsmanship \u2013 positive attitudes, sacrifice of \nweekends, helpful assistants\n\u2022 Organisational loyalty \u2013 help retention, carefully \nmanaging budgets, sharing best practice, efforts to \npresent positive image of company to researchers\n\u2022 Compliance \u2013 aligning with corporate strategy, fitting into \nHR\/diversity structures, performance measures\n\u2022 Individual initiative \u2013 setting up networks, persuading \nsponsors, persuading line managers\n\u2022 Civic virtue \u2013 tackling discrimination, monitoring \nprogress, keeping up with technology, sharing\n\u2022 Self-development \u2013 wide range of career development \nevents\n \nDISCUSSION \nOur findings support the evidence from previous \nstudies of gender and networking that women \nappreciate the benefits that networking can \nprovide, such as access to a wide variety of career \nresources and psycho-social support (Vinnicombe \n& Colwill, 1995; Pemberton and colleagues, 1996, \n1997; Linehan, 2001). The leaders focused on the \nbusiness and career development benefits of the \nnetworks, whilst members stressed the social \nsupport received.  \nClearly much energy and goodwill is being \ncontributed by network leaders and members \ntowards a common goal. Their voluntary activities \nare aimed at improving women\u2019s careers and to \ncreate a space in these organisations to provide a \nsupportive and developmental environment for \nwomen. We now discuss their motivations for \ninvolvement in the networks, drawing on theories \nassociated with organisational citizenship \nbehaviour (OCB). The members reported many \naspects of good citizenship behaviour as \nconceptualised by Organ (1997) and Podsakoff et \nal (2000), namely helping, sportsmanship, \norganisational loyalty, organisational compliance, \nindividual initiative, civic virtue, and self-\ndevelopment. These activities were extra-role, \nunpaid but provided a number of benefits for those \nengaged in these behaviours, as we reported \nearlier. See Figure 1. \n 2\nCertainly considerable effort was put into helping \nby women network leaders and the senior women. \nThey reported their desire and even passion to \nhelp other women and their company. Some did so \nbecause of enhanced understanding of their own \ncareers as they grew more senior or older, \nrealising the need for career management, \nimpression management, greater visibility and \nnetworking, and feeling a sense of frustration as \nyounger women did not appear to recognise the \npersistence of the glass ceiling.  \n\u201cOne comment, quite recently from a group \nof younger women said our activities were \nfor old women who are trying to protect their \ncareers. It was a difficult comment to react \nto, as where they are in lower levels, they \nare not a minority and I don\u2019t think they \nexperience any discrimination. (I certainly \nhope not, or all the work we have been \ndoing over the last 8 years will not have \nachieved its objectives.) I think it must \nalways be the case that if we are doing the \nright things, those that follow us will take \ntheir environment for granted and not see \nwhat we have gone through to change \nthings for them. But we must find a way to \nensure that the younger women coming \nthrough the ranks are aware of the issues \nthey will face as they get more senior and \nare equipped with the skills to resolve them. \nWe have a long way to go before the women \nat the top of our large corporation are no \nlonger minorities and we will need the \nyounger women to pick up the baton in their \nown way (which should be different from \nours) in the future.\u201d \nThe OCB component, sportsmanship, (tolerating \nwithout complaining) was evidenced by the fact \nthat the women contributing so much were \nmaintaining a positive attitude and were willing to \nput the needs of the women\u2019s network sometimes \nahead of their own personal time, as the network \nleader had done in spending her weekend \nanswering network emails. The secretaries of the \nnetwork leaders also showed sportsmanship in \nbearing much of the administrative load associated \nwith their bosses\u2019 voluntary commitments. \u201cMany \nof them are really keen to get involved anyway.\u201d \nSome were even working in their own time for the \ngood of the women in the company, despite their \njunior and low paid positions. But there was clearly \na limit to the voluntary additional workload that \ncould be tolerated, and most network leaders did \ntalk about burnout and the need to share the \nburden, often by co-chairing or committee role \nrotation, and by better process management. \nThere certainly was evidence of organizational \nloyalty (spreading goodwill and remaining \ncommitted), as the network organizers worked to \nimprove the retention of other women, carefully \nmanaged their budgets, worked with other \nnetworks to spread best practice, and made efforts \nto present a positive image of their company \nduring the interviews.  \nThe compliance element emerged at several \npoints, for example the network leaders\u2019 concerns \nwith alignment with corporate strategy, the fit into \ncareer development structures, the relationship \nwith HR and diversity departments, and the \nmeasures for success, including incorporating \nnetwork outputs into a balanced scorecard that \nfitted into the HR scorecard in one of the networks. \nThe women network leaders had individually \nshown initiative in setting up and managing the \nnetworks and in particular, getting resources from \na variety of sponsors. The women members also \nhad to show individual initiative to persuade their \nline managers to fund attendance at some events \nsuch as European conferences for members \nacross the various country subsidiaries.  \nClear evidence of civic virtue also emerged, as \nwomen leaders showed their willingness to \nparticipate in the policy-making arenas of their \ncompanies, engaging at the highest levels with \nchief executives and directors, seeking to tackle \ndiscrimination and dismantle career barriers not \njust for women but for all citizens of the company. \nThe women members also sought to keep up with \ntechnology advances that would change the nature \nof their companies\u2019 business, again indicating that \ntheir citizenship had wider concerns.  \nThere was much evidence of the last component of \nOCB, self-development, the voluntary behaviours \nthat employees undertake to improve themselves \nthat expand the range of contributions to the \ncompany. So much career development and \npersonal growth was being organized and \ndelivered to so many women, which could improve \norganizational effectiveness. \nSo OCB theory offers a good explanation for the \nwomen\u2019s behaviours in the networks, but does not \naddress the motivation for such behaviours. \nHuman and social capital theories explain why \nsenior and older women are more likely to \nvolunteer than junior and younger peers, as they \nhave more education, more experience and better \nunderstanding of women\u2019s careers in their \nparticular organisations, as well as more contacts \ngathered over many years (Wilson, 2000). Social \nexchange theory also predicts OCBs as an \nexchange of benefits in return for contributions. \nCertainly a number of rewards are suggested from \nour data. \nYounger women members reported wanting to \nshare, to support and be supported, to give and to \nlearn, all relevant to a social exchange perspective \n 3\non OCBs. However, for the older, more senior \nwomen, perhaps the desire to help was motivated \nby a sense of generativity (Erikson, 1963) as these \nwomen moved into the mid-life stage of their \ncareers. That contribution to younger versions of \nthemselves could provide a sense of immortality, \nbeing part of a movement advancing, driving \nchange for a better future. Many of the women \nleaders were still pioneers accessing senior levels \nof management. There is also the satisfaction in \nmid-career of passing on their acquired \nknowledge, getting pleasure from helping the next \ngeneration towards career success (Levinson, \n1996), and perhaps personal pride in being \nidentified as role models. In particular, the \nmentoring and role-modelling (Ragins and \nScandura, 1999) aspects of the networks can be \nexplained in this way, but also the motivation may \nbe to engage with youthful and creative people to \ngain a sense of rejuvenation of themselves as \nwomen leaders. \nWomen network activists may be motivated by the \nopportunities for their own enhanced visibility, \nwhich provides improved career, influence or \ncentrality prospects. As they organise events or \ntake on new committee roles, they would develop \ntheir own managerial potential. The act of seeking \nsponsorship provides another developmental \nchallenge, requiring the exercise of upwards \ninfluence skills to inspire, persuade or cajole \ngatekeepers for resources. The additional \ninformation gleaned about what is going on across \nthe company may also improve their own job \nperformance or careers. So their involvement \ncould be a form of impression management, the \n\u2018good soldier\u2019 syndrome (Kidder and Maclean-\nParks, 2001), and certainly some survey \nrespondents indicated that they saw this as the \nmotivation of the women network leaders. Another \npart of the exchange might be the recognition \nobtained, both from senior management and from \nwomen in the company, for their efforts in \norganising activities, but also in reflected collective \nrecognition and legitimacy of the network as the \njunior women move upwards, the business case is \nstrengthened, and network objectives and \nperformance measures are achieved. \nThere could be yet further explanations. Women \nare said to be more communal in orientation, and \nto strive to encompass the needs of others and \nself, to be caring and authentic in relationships with \nothers, resulting in feeling good about themselves \nas good organisational citizens and as good \npersons, but providing invisible and often \nunrecognised support (Fletcher, 1999). From a \npsychological perspective, this could be as a result \nof the essential nature of women, as caring, \ncommunal and wanting to be connected, not going \nthrough the separation process that men \nexperienced in their psychological development \nbut preferring attachment and community (Gilligan, \n1982). A more social-psychological view would \nhold that the communitarian behaviour could also \nbe as a result of gendered identification and \nsocialisation processes by gender role \nprescriptions, gender orientation or stereotypical \nrole expectations that expect women to behave in \na caring and supportive manner (Kidder, 2002).  \nOur findings suggest that the companies\u2019 \nmotivation for investing in women\u2019s networks was \nthe expectation of rewards from responding to \nwomen\u2019s needs. The endorsement by women \nleaders of the need for business performance \nmeasures and learning from best practice in \nnetwork management indicates that they were \nacting as good organizational citizens in \nstewarding rather than exploiting corporate assets, \nbut there was a comment that \u201cultimately we are \nsort of controlled through our budget \u2026 I\u2019m pretty \nsure that if we went too far off the acceptable path, \nour funds would be stopped pretty quickly.\u201d The \ncompanies would benefit from the creation of new \nsocial capital (Bolino, Turnley and Bloodgood, \n2002) as women built linkages across these large \ncompanies, making it easier to work across \nboundaries. They would also gain enhanced \nhuman capital in terms of more career-developed \nwomen, more female role models, more mentoring, \nmore organizational learning, more talent \nidentification, and better retention of women, \nalmost all done voluntarily with only small financial \nsupport. The networks also provide unique \ncommunication channels that went across as well \nas up and down the hierarchy.  Whether or not \nthere was genuine willingness in senior \nmanagement to change the culture, or simply to \npay lip service to the aims of the women\u2019s network, \nthere was evidence of the need to be seen to be \ndoing something for women, building reputation \nand hence legitimacy as a good employer.  \nHence social exchange theory provides a good \nexplanation for the motivations of those engaged in \nthese organisational citizenship behaviours. From \nthe company perspective, the support of women\u2019s \ncorporate networks makes business sense, as \nindicated by Brass et al. (2004) that internal \nnetworking led to better organisational \nperformance. From the women\u2019s perspective, there \nare likely to be many motivations, some of which \nwe have suggested in this section, drawing on \nevidence from both interviews and the survey \nmaterial. \nWe acknowledge some limitations of our study. \nThis is a small-scale study of only twelve women\u2019s \nnetworks within large companies based in the UK, \nand therefore generalisability of the findings may \nbe limited by region and size of company. There \nmay have been social desirability biases as \n 4\nnetwork leaders sought to present a business-like \nview of their activity, and of their company to the \nfemale researchers from the Centre for Developing \nWomen Business Leaders in a large business \nschool. The findings are based on self-reported \ndata, although we felt that our interviewees were \ngenuinely honest and open with us. We used \ntriangulation of sample and method, surveying \nnetwork members asking them to respond directly \nto us so that more honest answers could be given, \nbut network leaders provided the initial sample of \n100 members which could have been biased in \nselection. The exploratory nature of the study \nmeans that constructs were not defined at the \noutset. There are inevitable biases from our \ninvolvement as researchers as we interpreted the \ndata, created coding frameworks and reported \nfindings. \nThe findings of this study would be helpful for \npractitioners, particularly organisations seeking to \nset up networks for women or other groups of \nemployees. These findings would also be of \ninterest to women network leaders who are \nplanning to commit their time and energy to \nenhance career opportunities for other women, \nand as our study indicates, probably provide a \nrange of benefits for themselves. \nCONCLUSIONS \nThe paper contributes a new organisational \ncitizenship perspective (Organ, 1988, 1997; \nPodsakoff et al., 2000; Bolino et al., 2002) on \nwomen\u2019s corporate networking, extending previous \nwork on women and networking (Burke et al., \n1995; Linehan, 2001; Rothstein et al., 2001), and \nthe limited field of studies of women\u2019s corporate \nnetworks, where only two previous studies were \nfound (Catalyst, 1999; McCarthy, 2004). We have \npresented qualitative and quantitative evidence \nfrom both network leaders and network members \nto show how women\u2019s corporate networks are set \nup and managed, and the benefits that women\u2019s \ncorporate networks provide to the women \nmembers, leaders and the employer. Key findings \nwere the extent of voluntarily-contributed extra-role \nbehaviours undertaken, and interestingly, the \ntotally business-oriented view of their activities \npresented by network leaders. We noted the \npassion with which the network leaders reported \ntheir engagement. We found that the more senior \nwomen were significantly more likely than their \njunior peers to report prosocial behaviours such as \ndriving change, helping and supporting. We \nexplored the motivation of the women network \nleaders, network members and employers through \nan organisational citizenship lens. Social exchange \ntheory, human and social capital theories, and \ngendered psychological development and \nsocialisation theories informed our understanding \nof their motivations for networking.  \nFuture research is needed to examine the impact \nof corporate network membership on individual \nwomen\u2019s careers and on specific organisational \noutcomes. This project has identified the measures \nof success used by these networks, providing a \nstarting point for more quantitative work. Further \nresearch is suggested on the impact of other types \nof corporate networks, for example, those set up \nfor ethnic minorities or gay and lesbian groups. \nInternational comparative studies would also \nuseful.  \nREFERENCES \nBolino, M.C., Turnley, W.H. and Bloodgood, J.M. \n(2002), \u201cCitizenship behaviour and the creation \nof social capital in organisations\u201d, Academy of \nManagement Review, Vol. 27 No. 4, pp. 505-\n522. \nBrass, D.J., Galaskiewicz, J., Greve, H.R. and \nTsai, W.
