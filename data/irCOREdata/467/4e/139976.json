Introduction\nBecause of its outstanding physical properties, silicon carbide (SiC) is a very \npromising material for high power, high temperature and high frequency applications \n[1,2]. In recent years, SiC has been also found to form various one-dimensional (1-D) \nnanostructures (e.g. nanowires and nanotubes) and this fact makes SiC attractive for \nconstruction of nanoelectronic devices like SiCNW-based transistor [3]. SiC-based \n1-D nanostructures have been synthesized using many different processes (see [4,5] \nand references therein). Recently, it has been demonstrated that SiC nanowires \n(SiCNWs) can be produced also via thermolysis-induced carbonization of \nhalocarbons (combustion synthesis) which is efficient single step chemical reaction \nperformed in a closed reactor without external heating of the reactants [6].\nThe ideal SiCNWs are generally thin elongated SiC nanocrystals. However, \nSiCNWs usually possess various structural defects that can be divided into two \nclasses: (i) \u2018large-scale\u2019 deformations (e.g. diameter fluctuations [7], Y-junctions [8], \nbends [9], springs [10] or \u201cS\u201d-shaped sections [11]) and (ii) \u2018atomic-scale\u2019 defects \n(e.g. vacancies and antisites [12] or interstitials [13]). In general, the first class of \ndefects is characteristic of all 1-D nanostructures (e.g. like in the case of carbon \nnanotubes [14]) and the second class is related to the specific crystallographic \nproperties of SiC material. These two families of defects are of course in close \nrelationship because the deformation of SiCNW must be accompanied by the \nexistence of defects at atomic level. Furthermore, it is widely known that the atomic-\nscale defects perturb the local electronic structure of bulk SiC crystals [15-18]. In this\ncontext it is reasonable to expect that the defects influence the local surface electronic \nstructure of SiCNWs as well. The electronic structure of the cubic 3C-SiC crystal can \nbe altered by the existence of unintentionally introduced nitrogen dopant [19]. \nPage 3 of 22\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n3\nSimilarly, the band structure of 1-D SiC nanostrutures (nanotubes [20] and nanowires \n[21,22]) can be affected by nitrogen. It is also shown that electronic structure of \nSiCNWs can be modified when their surface is passivated with hydrogen [23]. Due to \nthese facts, the local contamination and doping of the defected SiCNW\u2019s region \nshould be also taken into account to explain local LDOS fluctuations. The present \nknowledge about defects and deformations of SiCNWs is very limited. However, this \nknowledge is necessary for understanding and designing the future SiCNWs-based\nnanoelectronic devices.\nThe aim of this study is to explore, for the first time, the fluctuations of the \nlocal density of electronic states (LDOS) in the vicinity of a SiCNW\u2019s deformation. \nScanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) \nare applied to reveal the topography and the local electronic structure of a bended \nSiCNW. STS is used in the current imaging tunneling spectroscopy (CITS) mode \nwhich allows us to correlate STM images with the surface LDOS distribution. We \nbelieve that these experiments provide new information about the surface electronic \nproperties of defective SiCNWs. \n2. Experimental\nThe STM\/STS\/CITS experiments are performed with a commercial \nVT-STM\/AFM system in UHV conditions (Omicron GmbH, Germany). The \nconcentration of SiCNWs on the samples is determined by using scanning electron \nmicroscope (SEM) Quanta 200 FEI. The STM tips are prepared by cutting \n90%Pt-10%Ir alloy wires (Goodfellow) mechanically. Silicon carbide nanowires are \nproduced by the thermolysis-induced carbonisation of halocarbons (combustion \nsynthesis) [6]. The initial reactant composition comprises of polytetrafluoroethylene \nPage 4 of 22\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n4\n(PTFE, 57.8 wt%) and calcium disilicide (CaSi2, 42.2 wt%) which gives the highest \nSiC yield. The obtained product is purified by calcination in air (900K, 1h) and a \nsubsequent washing with KOH (30 wt%), H2SO4 (96 wt%) and HCl (36 wt%). \nWashing the material in distilled water and drying follow each stage of purification. \nA piece of the purified product is then diluted in 1,2-dichloroethane using the \nultrasonic treatment (about 15 min). In the last step, we put a droplet of the mixture on \nthe highly orientated pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) substrate and leave the sample to dry \nup. After that the sample is transferred into the UHV system and investigated without \nfurther preparation.\nIn the CITS mode, the I\/V curves (128 points per single curve) are recorded \nsimultaneously with a constant current image (256 points \u00d7 256 points) by the use of \nan interrupted-feedback-loop technique. Based on these measurements, the first \nderivative of the tunneling current with respect to the voltage (dI\/dV) is calculated. \nThe dI\/dV spectra are normalized by dividing the differential conductance by the total \nconductance to obtain (dI\/dV)\/(I\/V) [24]. The divergence problem in this case is \novercome by applying some amount of broadening (\uf044V) to the I\/V values [25] \n(\uf044V=1 V for all curves in our case). Topographic STM images are collected in the \nconstant current mode at the positive sample bias voltage Us=0.2-1 V and the\ntunneling current set point I=0.2-1.0 nA. \n3. Results and discussion\nThe distribution of the SiCNWs is preliminarily determined by using SEM and \na representative image (secondary electrons detector) is shown in Fig. 1. In the upper \npart of the image, a relatively large concentration of SiCNWs can be observed. Such a \nconcentration and a tangle of SiCNWs is not suitable for STM measurements because \nPage 5 of 22\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n5\nof the high probability of the STM tip damage. In the central part of the imag,e a \nbunch of  SiCNWs is also visible. The typical diameter of the SiCNWs is estimated to \nbe in the range of 10-100 nm. The SiCNWs\u2019 length usually exceeds 1 \uf06dm but it can \nalso be as large as several tens of \uf06dm. Most of the observed SiCNWs are straight but \nsome objects exhibit the existence of deformations. In the lower part of the area \n(especially in the right down corner), the concentration of SiCNWs is relatively small \nand objects lie flat on the substrate which opens the possibility for STM \nmeasurements of individual and isolated objects and their defects.\nThe topographic STM image of a bended SiCNW is presented in Fig. 2a. The \nmaximum height of the object on both sides of the bend is in the range of 96-100 nm \nrelative to the HOPG substrate. This almost constant value of the relative height over \nthe whole deformation region suggests that the bended nanowire is lying almost flat \non the substrate and this is confirmed by an excellent stability of the object during \nSTM\/STS investigations. Furthermore, it can also be supposed that this high stability \nis the fingerprint of good electrical contact between the substrate and the nanowire \ndue to the strong interaction between them. The width of the nanowire in plane of the \nsample is about 400-450 nm which is approximately 4 times more than the observed \nheight. It is quite probable that the tip convolution effect should be here taken into \naccount [26] to explain this discrepancy. However, it is also possible that the \nnanowire consists of a few thinner nanowires (we have reported a similar effect \npreviously [27]), forming a kind of flattened bundle. The angle between the two parts \nof the bended nanowire is 126\u00ba\u00b12\u00ba. The more detailed image of the SiCNW\u2019s \ndeformation is presented in Fig. 2b where we apply the standard deviation filter to \nexpose existing edges. We can see that there are shallow trenches, less than 5 nm \ndeep, running along the nanowire. In the deformation region, we can observe more \nPage 6 of 22\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n6\ncomplicated structures. From Fig. 2a and 2b it is clear that some parts of the nanowire \nare completely broken and sharp edges of these broken parts are exposed in the region \nof deformation (denoted by white arrows in Fig. 1a). Because the SiCNWs produced \nin combustion synthesis are mostly 3C-SiC nanowires, and they are predominantly \nwith [111] orientation (see [6]), it is probable that this deformation resembles the \ngeometry of large-diameter nanowire under mechanical bending [9]. In this context \nwe suppose that the deformation was rather formed after the synthesis process (e.g. \nduring purification, ultrasonic treatment, or deposition). However, we think that the \nviolent nature of combustion synthesis also allows formation of such defects. \nTo investigate the surface electronic properties of the SiCNW in the vicinity of \nthe bend, we apply the STS technique. The typical behaviour of the I(V) \nspectroscopic curves (averaged by 10 points \u00d7 10 points) is presented in Fig. 3. Two \ncurves represent the area on the left (I) and on the right (II) outside the bend of the \nSiCNW (dashed and dash-dotted grey line, respectively). It is clear that these curves \nhave very similar shape, i.e. they are asymmetric with respect to 0 V because the \nabsolute current values are smaller for negative sample bias voltages than for the \npositive sample bias voltages. It means that surface electronic properties on both sides \nof SiCNW outside the deformation are similar. These I(V) traces show no existence of \nthe band gap (~2.2 eV for bulk 3C-SiC) and are similar to the I(V) traces recorded \npreviously for SiCNWs deposited on gold substrate. As we proposed previously [21],  \nthe shape of those I(V) curves can be attributed to n-type semiconducting properties \nof nitrogen-doped SiCNW\u2019s surface, or alternatively, to the surface carbon \nenrichment. It should be admitted here that the reproducibility of I(V) curves on gold \n(previous study [21]) and HOPG (this study) also suggests that the type of the \nsubstrate, i.e. gold or HOPG, does not affect the I(V) measurements substantially. In \nPage 7 of 22\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n7\nthe case of the I(V) curve representing the deformation region (III, solid black line), \none can notice increased absolute values of the current at negative biases which \nmeans that the I(V) curve becomes more symmetric. For comparison, the I(V) trace \nrecorded on bare HOPG substrate is shown (dotted black line). This is almost \nsymmetric which is characteristic of flat terraces of the semimetallic HOPG surface in \nthe STS low voltage limit (below 1 V) [28]. In this context we suggest that the \nevolution of the I(V) shape from asymmetric (far from deformation) to more \nsymmetric shape (close to deformation) may be ascribed to the change of the \nSiCNW\u2019s chemical composition near the deformation. Although it was proposed that \nmechanical bending weakly influences the atomic coordination near the deformation \n[9], it seems to be probable that the chemical composition can be changed by the \ndiffusion of atomic scale defects, like Si and C interstitials, that can migrate and tend \nto agglomerate in the vicinity of deformations at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, \nit should be noted that the activation temperatures are different for C (450 K) and Si \n(650 K) interstitials [29]. Because the activation temperature is lower for C \ninterstitials, it suggests their higher mobility at elevated temperatures. Thus, we think \nthat in our case the calcination of SiCNWs performed at 900 K can be responsible for \nthe privileged segregation of C interstitials when a locally graphitised region is \nformed in the vicinity of SiCNW\u2019s deformation. However, the comparison of the I(V) \ntraces recorded over the bend and bare HOPG shows that they are not identical. This \ncan be attributed to only partial graphitisation of SiC and forming a carbon-enriched \nsubsurface region which has electronic properties halfway between SiC and graphite. \nThe calculated first derivative dI\/dV and (dI\/dV)\/(I\/V) curves for different \nregions of the SiCNW are presented in Figs. 4a and 4b, respectively. However, the \nconvenient measure of the surface LDOS is the normalized tunneling conductance \nPage 8 of 22\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n8\n(dI\/dV)\/(I\/V) [24], and for metallic or semiconducting surfaces the maxima observed \nin (dI\/dV)\/(I\/V) characteristics can be often related to the existence of surface states \n[30] or defect states [31]. Thus, we will focus on (dI\/dV)\/(I\/V) analysis in more detail \n(Fig. 4b). Curve #1 is representative for the straight part of the SiCNW and curve #2 \nis representative for the region of the bend. There are at least three important \ndifferences between these curves. The first is the shape which resembles \u201cU\u201d for \ncurve #1 and \u201cV\u201d for curve #2. This change suggests that the LDOS below and above \nthe Fermi level (EF) is enhanced over the bend. The second is the shift of the global \nminimum from about 0 V (outside the bend) to \u20130.1 V (over the bend), and this in \nturn suggests the tendency to move EF slightly towards the conduction band near the \ndeformation of the SiCNW. The third observation is that the lowest LDOS value at EF\nis non-zero for both curve #1 and curve #2, but over the bend (curve #2) the LDOS at \nEF is higher than outside the bend (curve #1). All these facts suggest that the \nSICNW\u2019s surface is not homogenous and it is probably more metallic in the vicinity \nof the deformation. \nIt should be stressed tha  in the case of our measurement of the deformed \nSiCNW, the energy positions of LDOS peaks are slightly varying and depend on \nposition of the STM tip over the scanned object which in turn can be ascribed to the \nlocal variation of the SiCNW\u2019s structure. For this reason, we have performed a \nstatistical analysis of the energy distribution of LDOS maxima. Two rectangular \nregions are selected outside the bend (region I on the left side and region III on the \nright side, respectively; see Fig. 2b) and the region embracing the bend (region II, \nFig. 2b). The area of the analysis is always the same and equals to 81\uf0b4286 nm2. To \nextract the statistical distribution of (dI\/dV)\/(I\/V) maxima, we use the self-written \nsoftware allowing the first order derivative calculation by applying the spline \nPage 9 of 22\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n9\ninterpolation procedure and finding a local maximum for each point of each curve \nfrom a selected CITS region. Then, a histogram is constructed by counting the \nnumber of obtained maxima in the given energy range (bin size: 0.03 eV). In fact, we \ncount the number of (dI\/dV)\/(I\/V) maxima for each energy value (128 points) and for \neach curve (approximately 4200 curves in the area of analysis) and make a separate \nhistogram for each region. In the Fig. 5a, the histograms corresponding to three \ndifferent regions of the SiCNW are presented. In our opinion, the histograms on the \nleft and on the right side (i.e. outside) of the bend, are relatively similar because they \nseem to show predominant existence of four maxima below the EF (valence band) at \naround -0.2 eV, -0.4 eV, -0.6 eV and -0.8 eV. However, the maxima for region III  \nseem to be better pronounced than the maxima for region I. This can be probably \nrelated to the lower roughness of the SiCNW of region III in comparison with \nregion I. Although the maxima from regions I and III are distributed quite\nperiodically, we suppose that they should rather not be attributed to the Coulomb \nblockade effect (CBE) which can appear in double barrier tunnelling system \n(tip-SiCNW and SiCNW-substrate) because: (i) the maxima appear only at negative \nvoltages (CBE emerges typically at both negative and positive bias voltages [32]); \n(ii)  the observed SiCNW is too large to exhibit CBE (good comparison can be made \nwith much smaller single-walled carbon nanotubes where CBE was detectable [33]). \nThe almost periodic order of peaks in region I and III is not reproduced over the bend \n(region II) where we can only see one pronounced maximum at around -0.3 eV and \nweakly pronounced features at -0.6\u00f7-0.5 eV. It means that the LDOS close to the \nSiCNW\u2019s deformation is strongly affected by the existing defects and, as a result, the \nLDOS is inhomogeneous. This causes the variation of LDOS maxima over the bend \nand their appearance at many different positions in energy scale that results in a rather \nPage 10 of 22\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n10\nflat histogram. The characteristic maximum at -0.3 eV seems to be correlated with the \ndeformation region as presented on the LDOS map in Fig. 5b. We can see that bright \nspots are located mostly over the bend which means that the deformation is probably \nrelated to the enhanced LDOS at -0.3 eV of the SiCNW\u2019s. We should admit that \nabove EF (conduction band) the number of counted maxima is a few times smaller \nthan below EF, so we have decided not to analyse these parts of histograms because of \ntheir lower statistical importance. Although there seems to be a difference between \nthe histograms representing straight parts of SiCNW and the region of deformation, \nthe exact interpretation of the observed peak positions is a point to debate. For the \nstraight SiCNWs, we proposed three hypotheses to explain the origin of LDOS \nmaxima: the disturbances of nitrogen-related donor band, the defects states assigned \nto the subsurface carbon enrichment, and the surface states attributed to the \nreconstruction process on the SiC nanowire surface (see also [21] and references \ntherein). In this context we suppose that the change of SiCNW\u2018s electronic properties \nin the vicinity of a bend should be rather assigned to the specific chemical \ncomposition\/stoichiometry and presumably local carbon-enrichment. \nThe recently reported experimental investigations of the influence of the \ndefective regions on th  SiCNWs\u2019 electronic structure suggest additional factors that \nshould be taken into account [33]. The authors detected the inner potential bending in \nSiCNWs across the interface of the perfect crystal and the defective regions using \nelectron holography and they also proposed the creation of a p-n junction in a \nSiCNW. Along with the authors, we think that not only the structure or stoichiometry \nfluctuations but also the segregation of impurities can be responsible for this local \nchange of SiCNW\u2019s electronic structure. We suppose that in our case the most \nprobable dopant is nitrogen which was detected in our samples using x-ray \nPage 11 of 22\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n11\nphotoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) [22]. Because N can act as a donor in SiC material, \nit seems to be reasonable that structurally defective and porous parts of SiCNWs can \nbe subject to contamination and local doping. We suppose that increased \nconcentration of nitrogen close to the structural deformation can be responsible for the \napparent LDOS fluctuations.\nThere is also another important factor which should be taken into account in \nthe analysis of the CITS data which is related to the possible oxidation of the \nSiCNWs\u2019 surface. The existence of thin SiO2 overlayer cannot be excluded in our \ncase because the samples are prepared in ambient air atmosphere and are not cleaned \nunder UHV conditions. Our previous XPS measurements also revealed noticeable \namount of oxygen in SiCNWs\u2019 material [22]. As has been shown previously [34], the \nSiC\/SiO2 interface on SiC monocrystallic surfaces introduces new electronic states \nthat are ascribed to formation of sp2-bonded carbon clusters, graphite-like clusters and \noxide traps. It has also been proposed there that in the case of 3C-SiC surfaces \nespecially the graphite-like defects can significantly alter the interface LDOS at \nenergies close to the 3C-SiC conduction band edge. On the other hand, the sp2-bonded \ncarbon clusters can modify LDOS going from EF towards the valence band edge. The \nSTM\/STS investigations performed on oxidized 6H-SiC (0001) [35] and 3C-SiC \n(001) [36] surfaces confirm that the formation of SiO2 layer influences STS results. \nFor instance, the (dI\/dV)\/(IV) curves in [36] exhibit the shift of the curves global \nminima (and also the valence band edge) towards the EF along with local surface \noxidation. In this context we suppose that the oxide overlayer can influence the \nsurface electronic structure of SiCNWs, but in our case the situation seems to be even \nmore complicated becasue: (i) we are dealing with a 1-D structure and not a \nmonocrystalline surface, so the simple comparison between SiCNWs and 3C-SiC \nPage 12 of 22\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n12\nsurfaces cannot be made, (ii) the SiCNWs\u2019 sidewalls can have various \ncrystallographic orientation, (iii) one should take into account the influence of other \ncontaminations (e.g. nitrogen) or non-stoichiometry (e.g. carbon enrichment) and their \ninterference (e.g. the formation of silicon oxynitride [37]). Thus, we think that the \npresence of oxide layer can influence STS measurements both on straight and bended \nparts of SiCNWs. The changing of the thickness or the composition of oxide layer \nmay be partially responsible for the local fluctuations of the (dI\/dV)\/(IV) spectra. \nUnfortunately, this influence cannot be unambiguously determined based on the \nSTM\/STS results only. Nevertheless, we think that the oxide insulating overlayer (if \nexists) must be rather thin (less than 1 nm) as it still allows stable STM \nmeasurements. Otherwise the tip would crash the sample because of the mechanical \ncontact with the insulating layer. We claim that the full picture cannot be drawn here. \nOur new experiments are in progress to establish the SiCNWs cleaning procedure \nunder UHV conditions and to determine the influence of different contaminations and \ntheir interferences on SiCNWs\u2019 surface electronic properties. \n4. Summary\nWe investigated the morphology and the electronic structure of defected \nSiCNW produced via combustion synthesis. The STM images revealed the \ncomplicated structure of the bended SiCNW. The measurements performed in the \nCITS mode allowed us to correlate the surface topography with the accompanying \nI(V) and LDOS variations in the vicinity of the deformation region. The STS data \nshowed the evolution of the I(V) characteristics from asymmetric shape towards \nsymmetric shape. The evolution of LDOS exhibiting the enhanced values below EF\nPage 13 of 22\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n13\nand shift of the global minimum towards conduction band were related to the possible \nmetalicity of the deformation. The statistical analysis of the LDOS over the \ndeformation revealed the predominant existence of the maximum at 0.3 eV below EF. \nThe behaviour of both I(V) and LDOS was ascribed to the inhomogeneous chemical \ncomposition of the defected SiCNW\u2019s region and probably to its partial surface \ngraphitisation. The unintentional nitrogen doping was also considered as a reason for \nthe metallic LDOS in the vicinity of the SiCNW\u2019s deformation. The formation of the \nthin oxide overlayer (SiO2) is also taken into account to explain the fluctuations of the \nlocal electronic properties on the SiCNWs\u2019 surface.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was partly financed by European Regional Development Fund \nwithin the framework of Operational Programme Innovative Economy \n2007-2013 (No. UDA-POIG.01.03.01-14-071\/08-00).
