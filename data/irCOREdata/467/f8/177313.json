Thomson, Richard Hansen, Susan H. Berry, Emad M. El-Omar,\nGeorgina L. Hold*\nGastrointestinal Research Group, Division of Applied Medicine, University of Aberdeen, Foresterhill, Aberdeen, United Kingdom\nAbstract\nIntroduction: The critical role of bacteria in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC) is well recognized, but an individual\ncausative microorganism has not been singled out so far. Campylobacter concisus and other non-jejuni species of\nCampylobacter have been implicated as putative aetiological agents in inflammatory bowel disease in children, but such\nstudies have not been addressed in adults. This study investigated the prevalence of Campylobacter species in colonic\nbiopsy samples from adults with UC and healthy controls.\nMethods: Adult patients who were undergoing diagnostic colonoscopy were recruited for the study, which included 69\npatients with histologically proven UC and 65 healthy controls. DNA was extracted from the biopsy samples and subjected\nto Campylobacter genus specific and Campylobacter concisus specific polymerase chain reaction and sequencing.\nResults: Detection of all Campylobacter DNA utilising genus specific primers was significantly higher in cases of UC, with a\nprevalence of 73.9% (51\/69) compared to 23.1% (15\/65) in controls (p = 0.0001). Nested PCR for C. concisusDNAwas positive in\n33.3% (23\/69) of biopsy samples from subjects with UC, which was significantly higher than the prevalence rate of 10.8% (7\/65)\nfrom controls (p = 0.0019). Sequencing of the remaining Campylobacter positive samples revealed that Campylobacter\nureolyticuswas positive in 21.7% (15\/69) of samples from UC subjects as opposed to 3.1% (2\/65) in controls (p = 0.0013). Mixed\nCampylobacter species were more common in UC patients, 20.3% (14\/69) as compared to controls 4.6% (3\/65) (p = 0.0084).\nConclusion: The higher prevalence of Campylobacter genus and more specifically C. concisus and C. ureolyticus in biopsy\nsamples from adults with UC suggests these genera of bacteria may be involved in the chronic inflammation that is\ncharacteristically seen in UC. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of this association of C. concisus and C.\nureolyticus with UC in adults.\nCitation: Mukhopadhya I, Thomson JM, Hansen R, Berry SH, El-Omar EM, et al.

During the last\ntwo decades there has been a significant increase in IBD associated\nhospitalization, outlining the enormous economic impact to health\nservices [1]. It has been projected that at anytime up to 240,000\npeople are affected by IBD in the UK [2]. More specifically, the\nepidemiological pattern of UC has changed significantly with an\nincreased incidence estimated at 10\u201320 per 100 000 per year. The\nincidence rate of juvenile onset UC has also risen in Scotland over\nthe last twenty years, which translates into a longer period of\nmonitored healthcare for affected individuals [3,4,5].\nUlcerative colitis has been traditionally observed in developed\nsocieties but with increasing westernization its prevalence has been\non the rise in developing countries as well [6,7]. The current\nparadigm of the pathogenesis of UC revolves around an aberrant\nhost immune response that is triggered by a poorly understood\ninteraction between the microbiome and host genetic defects\ninvolved in the identification and clearance of microbes [8]. The\ngenetic associations with UC are not as strong as CD suggesting a\ngreater role of luminal factors influencing its pathogenesis. It is\npostulated that \u2018dysbiosis\u2019 or an imbalance between protective and\nharmful components of the luminal microbiota in favour of the\nlatter plays a critical role in initiating and possibly perpetuating\ninflammation in UC [9].\nRecent methodological advances in studying the gut micro-\nbiome have made clear distinctions between the mucosa-\nassociated and faecal populations [10,11]. It is suggested that in\nhealthy individuals the mucosal microbiome forms a synergistic\nand stable interaction with the host immune system, while the\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 June 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 6 | e21490\nluminal or faecal microbiome varies based on diet or other\nenvironmental factors. This distinction is critical as it is therefore\nmore likely that mucosa-associated bacteria will have the ability\nand proximity to invade the protective mucous layer and the\nintestinal epithelial barrier. Helicobacter and Bacteroides species are\ntwo groups of mucosa-associated bacteria that have been\nimplicated in the pathogenesis of UC [12,13,14]. A recent\nepidemiological study demonstrated an increased risk of IBD in\nindividuals with an episode of Campylobacter or Salmonella\ngastroenteritis, suggesting that infection with particular bacteria\nmay trigger the process that ultimately leads to the chronic\ninflammation of IBD [15]. Other population-based studies have\nhowever refuted these findings and suggested that this association\nis perhaps a result of detection bias [16]. More recently, the role of\nnon-jejuni Campylobacter species have evoked attention, predomi-\nnantly in paediatric Crohn\u2019s disease [17,18].\nThe members of the Campylobacter genus comprise Gram\nnegative, spiral, microaerophilic bacteria that reside in the small\nor large intestine of humans and animals. At least a dozen species\nof Campylobacter have been associated with human disease, with\nCampylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli the most commonly\nisolated strains. However, newer information suggests that non-\njejuni Campylobacter species, most specifically Campylobacter concisus,\nmay be responsible for infective gastroenteritis and septicaemia in\nchildren [19]. This species has also been isolated from stool\nsamples of immunocompromised patients with diarrhoea suggest-\ning that it may even be an opportunistic pathogen [20]. The recent\nreclassification of Campylobacter ureolyticus has added another species\nin the broader genus of Campylobacter having previously been within\nthe Bacteroides [21]. The identification of this species in the faeces of\nsubjects presenting with gastroenteritis suggests that it may also be\nan emerging enteric pathogen [22]. It appears that non-jejuni\nCampylobacter species are increasingly being identified as potential\ngastrointestinal pathogens. This study has for the first time aimed\nto delineate these mucosa-associated bacteria in biopsy samples\nfrom adults with ulcerative colitis.\nMethods\nStudy Subjects\nPatients were recruited from the department of gastroenterology\nat Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. These subjects were recruited for a\nprevious study looking at the role of enterohepatic Helicobacter in\nUC [14]. Sixty-nine patients with a primary diagnosis of UC on\nthe basis of a histological diagnosis from colonoscopic biopsies\nwere recruited and assessed. The extent and severity of disease was\nscored according to the Montreal criteria [23]. A total of sixty-five\nhealthy controls were recruited from the bowel cancer screening\nprogramme if they had documented absence of both macroscopic\nand microscopic inflammation. Subjects were excluded if they\nreceived antibiotics within six months prior to recruitment.\nColonic biopsies were obtained from colonoscopy procedures\ncarried out at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, Aberdeen, UK. Ethical\napproval for the study was granted by the North of Scotland\nResearch Ethics Service, UK (reference number 04\/S0802\/8).\nWritten informed consent was obtained from all subjects in the\nstudy.\nBiopsy collection, Processing and Genomic DNA\nExtraction\nBiopsy samples were collected from patients with UC and\ncontrols during colonoscopy using standard endoscopic forceps\n(Boston Scientific Nanterre Cedex France). The colonic mucosa\nwas washed with sterile water via the colonoscope to remove\nresidual faecal material. Biopsies were immediately snap-frozen in\nliquid nitrogen and then transferred to a -80uC freezer for storage\npending DNA extraction and analysis.\nGenomic DNA was extracted from the biopsies using the\nQIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) according to an\nestablished modification of the manufacturer\u2019s instructions,\noptimised in-house for colonic biopsy tissue [14]. Biopsy samples\nwere kept frozen until the addition of ATL buffer, thereafter they\nwere allowed to equilibrate to room temperature. An additional\n10 ml of Proteinase K was added for an initial lysis period of\n18 hours to ensure complete lysis of the biopsy material prior to\nDNA extraction. DNA obtained from the biopsy samples was\ninitially subjected to universal bacterial PCR to confirm the\nsuitability of the DNA for further analysis [24].\nPCR amplification\nCampylobacter genus specific PCR. The Campylobacter\ngenus-specific primers, C412F and C1228 R, described by\nLinton et al in 1996 were used to amplify a <800 bp fragment\nwithin the 16S rRNA gene of Campylobacter species [25].\nCampylobacter DNA was detected in the extracted biopsy samples\nby PCR using a 50 ml reaction mixture consisting of 10 pmol of\neach primer (C412F and C1228R [Sigma-Aldrich, UK]), 16PCR\nbuffer (Roche, UK), 250 nM of each deoxy-nucleotide-\ntriphosphate (Bioline, UK), 2 mM MgCl2 (Roche, UK), 1 U of\nTaq polymerase (Roche,UK), and 40 ng of DNA. The PCR\ncycling conditions used were: 30 cycles of 94uC for 30 seconds,\n55uC for 30 seconds, and 72uC for 2 minutes.\nCampylobacter concisus specific PCR. C. concisus specific\nprimers, Concisus F and Concisus R, were used to amplify a\n560 bp fragment within the 16S rRNA gene of C. concisus strains as\nper the protocol described by Ming Man et al in 2010 [18]. The\nsequences corresponding to the primer pair Concisus F\/Concisus\nR were located within the region amplified by the Campylobacter\ngenus specific primer C412F and C1228R and hence a nested\nPCR approach was used to identify the C. concisus strains -\nCampylobacter genus-specific PCR was therefore followed by C.\nconcisus specific PCR. The composition of a 50 ml PCR reaction\nmixture was: 10 pmol of each primer (Concisus F and Concisus R\n[Sigma-Aldrich, UK]), 16 PCR buffer (Roche, UK), 250 nM of\neach deoxy-nucleotide-triphosphate (Bioline, UK), 2 mM MgCl2\n(Roche, UK) and 1 U of Taq polymerase (Roche, UK). The\noptimum thermal cycling conditions for the C. concisus-specific\nnested PCR were: 94uC for 5 minutes, 40 cycles of 94uC for\n30 seconds, 65uC for 30 seconds, and 72uC for 1 minute, followed\nby 72uC for 7 minutes.\nCloning and Sequencing\nTo enable the identification of other Campylobacter species,\nCampylobacter genus positive PCR products were first subjected to\nrestriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis by\ndigestion with Dde I enzyme [26]. PCR products which did not\nshow a mixed RFLP pattern were directly sequenced on an Applied\nBiosystems model 3730 automated capillary DNA sequencer using\nthe Campylobacter genus specific primers C412F and C1228R.\nSamples with mixed RFLP profiles were analyzed by cloning the\nCampylobacter genus positive PCR products into JM109 competent\ncells with pGEM-T-easy vector and the sequence of the insert was\nestablished with M13 sequencing primers.\nThe sequences obtained were compared to those of the National\nCenter for Biotechnology Information GenBank database using\nthe basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) search program\n(http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).\nRole of Campylobacter in Ulcerative Colitis\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 June 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 6 | e21490\nMultiple alignments and phylogenetic analyses were performed\nusing Bioedit (version 7.0.5.3) (http:\/\/www.mbio.ncsu.edu\/BioE-\ndit\/bioedit.html) and a dendogram was constructed using MEGA\nversion 4 software [27].\nGenBank Sequence Submission\nAll 16S rRNA gene sequences derived from either direct\nsequencing or cloning of Campylobacter genus-specific PCR\nproducts were submitted to GenBank with the accession numbers\nfrom JF795865 to JF795912.\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using the Pearson Chi\nSquared, 2-tailed test or the Fisher\u2019s exact test wherever\nappropriate, utilising Graph Pad software (San Diego, CA).\nResults\nPatient characteristics\nThe prospective UC cohort (n = 69, male 46.4%) had a mean\nage of 45.3617.9 years at the time of index colonoscopy. The\ncontrol group (n = 65, male 59.3%) had a mean age of\n61.468.5 years at the time of index colonoscopy. There was\na statistically significant difference in age between the UC\ncohort and the control group (p,0.0001). A total of 115 biopsy\nsites were analysed from UC patients. Twenty four (34.8%)\nsubjects had a single site analysed and 45 (65.2%) had more\nthan one biopsy site assessed. Of the 115 biopsies analysed, 68\n(59.1%) were from histologically inflamed sites, whereas 47\n(40.9%) were from histologically normal sites A single biopsy\nsite was analysed from each control subject. The clinical\ncharacteristics and Montreal classification of the patients with\nUC are summarised in Table 1.\nDetection of Campylobacter concisus from mucosal\nbiopsy samples of adults with UC and controls\nUtilising the species-specific primers, C. concisus was detected in\n23 of the 69 subjects with ulcerative colitis and 7 of the 65 controls.\nThe prevalence of C. concisus in the UC population was 33.3%\nwhich was significantly higher than that in the controls, 10.8%\n(p= 0.0019) (Figure 1).\nDetection of all Campylobacter species from mucosal\nbiopsy samples of adults with UC and controls\nUtilising Campylobacter genus specific primers, Campylobacter DNA\nwas detected in 51 of the 69 patients with UC, and 15 of the 65\ncontrols. The prevalence of Campylobacter was significantly higher\nin cases of UC, with a prevalence of 73.9% compared to 23.1% in\ncontrols (p = 0.0001). Sequencing of the remaining Campylobacter\npositive samples revealed that C. ureolyticus was present in 21.7%\n(15\/69) of samples from UC patients as opposed to 3.08% (2\/65)\nfrom controls (p = 0.0013) (Figure 1). Detailed breakdown of all the\nspecies identified from both UC subjects and controls is\nsummarised in Table 2. Other notable members of the\nCampylobacter genus that were identified include: Campylobacter\nhominis, Campylobacter curvus, Campylobacter gracilis, Campylobacter\nshowae and Campylobacter jejuni.\nMixed Campylobacter species from mucosal biopsy\nsamples of adults with UC and controls\nMixed Campylobacter species were more likely in UC patients,\n20.3% (14\/69) as compared to controls 4.6% (3\/65)\n(p = 0.0084). The most commonly identified combination of\nCampylobacter species in adults with UC was C.ureolyticus and C.\nhominis seen in 8.7% of all cases. The most common mix in the\ncontrols was C. concisus and C. hominis accounting for 3.1% of\ncases. A variety of different Campylobacter combinations were\nnoted in UC as opposed to controls wherein only two\ncombinations involving C. concisus\/C. hominis and C. hominis\/C.\ncurvus were found (Table 2).\nPrevalence of Campylobacter species and Campylobacter\nconcisus in relation to gender, site of disease and severity\nof symptoms\nThere were no significant differences noted between the\nprevalence of Campylobacter species or indeed C. concisus with\nrespect to gender of subjects with UC or controls. The prevalence\nof all Campylobacter species and C. concisus with reference to extent\nand severity of disease is summarised in Table 3.

The detection of Campylobacter species and C. concisus was\nalso studied in relation to the severity of symptoms according to\nthe Montreal classification, as summarised in Table 3. The only\nsignificant difference noted was with the prevalence of all\nCampylobacter species and disease severity between patients with\nmoderate UC (87.5%) and those with severe UC (50%) (p = 0.01).\nNo significant differences were noted between the prevalence of\nCampylobacter concisus with respect to severity of symptoms.\nPrevalence of Campylobacter species and Campylobacter\nconcisus in relation to inflamed and non-inflamed biopsy\nsamples from subjects with UC\nOf the 115 biopsy sites analysed from subjects with UC, 68 were\nfrom histologically inflamed sites whereas 47 were from sites that\nwere histologically normal. The prevalence of all Campylobacter\nspecies was 66.2% (45\/68) from inflamed biopsies and 46.8% from\nhistologically normal biopsies (22\/47) which was significant\n(p = 0.038). However, there was no significant difference noted\nbetween the prevalence of Campylobacter concisus in inflamed\nbiopsies 25% (17\/68) and that from normal biopsies 21.3%(10\/\n47) (p = 0.64).\nComparison of Campylobacter and Helicobacter species\nfrom mucosal biopsies\nAs previously stated, Helicobacteraceae PCR positivity was\nsignificantly higher in UC than controls within this cohort: 32 of\n69 (46.4%) versus 10 of 65 (15.4%) respectively (p = 0.0002) [14].\nThe majority of Helicobacter species were non-pylori, constituting\n96.9% (31\/32) of all PCR positive subjects with UC and 80% (8\/\n10) of all PCR positive controls. We wanted to compare the\npreviously published Helicobacter prevalence with Campylobacter\npositivity from the current study. The prevalence of Campylobacter\nin subjects with UC (51\/69) was higher than the prevalence of all\nHelicobacter (32\/69) but it did not reach statistical significance\n(p = 0.252). Similarly, the difference between the prevalence of\nCampylobacter (15\/65) and Helicobacter (10\/65) was not statistically\nsignificant in controls (p = 0.374). The prevalence of both these\nbacterial groups was significantly less in controls as opposed to\npatients with UC.

Campylobacter was detected in a significantly\nlarger proportion of UC patients as opposed to controls.\nFurthermore, two individual species, namely C. concisus and C.\nureolyticus were found to have a significant association with UC.\nThe control group comprised of a significantly older group of\npatients as they had been recruited from the bowel screening\nprogramme. A recent study found that the greatest incidence of\nCampylobacter infection was for those aged more than 60 years of\nage, making this difference even more clinically significant [28]. A\nstudy documenting prevalence of C. concisus in salivary samples\nfrom different age groups did not find any significant difference\namong various adult age groups but found the prevalence to be\nsignificantly lower in the children age 3\u20135 years [29].\nIn the last two years, C. concisus has been associated with\npaediatric CD, with two studies documenting this association from\nfaecal and biopsy samples [17,18]. The reported prevalence of C.\nconcisus from these two studies was 65% from faecal samples and\n51% from biopsy samples. The prevalence of C. concisus in biopsy\nsamples from adult UC in our study was lower than these studies\nat 31.9%. Our finding contrasts with these previous studies as it is\nbased on adult subjects with UC as opposed to children with CD.\nTherefore, our findings have expanded the role of C. concisus to\nencompass both forms of IBD necessitating further studies to firstly\nvalidate our findings and secondly to delineate the exact\nmechanism of this association.\nThis study not only found an increased prevalence of C. concisus\nin mucosal biopsy samples from adults with UC but also identified\nDNA from this putative pathogen in one in ten controls. C. concisus\nis a common commensal in the oral mucosa and it has been\nassociated with periodontitis [30]. A study by Zhang et al aimed to\nlook at the relative rates of isolation and detection of C. concisus\nfrom salivary samples of healthy controls and patients with IBD\nbut did not find any significant difference between the two groups\n(97% vs. 100%) [29]. Protein profiling of six of the oral strains\nwere compared with an intestinal strain of C. concisus using SDS-\nPAGE. Interestingly only one of the six oral strains matched the\nintestinal strain, suggesting that different strains of the bacteria\nmay exist in the oral cavity with some having the ability to colonise\nthe intestine. The increased detection of this oral commensal in\nUC may be as a result of defective innate immunity, allowing\neasier access to an additional ecological niche where the organism\nmay potentially cause disease. This hypothesis is supported by the\ndetection of this pathogen during episodes of diarrhoea in\nimmunocompromised adults [20]. Additionally, the finding of this\nbacterium in the extremes of age groups, who are characterized\nwith poorer immunity, suggests that C. concisus may be an\nopportunistic pathogen [31].\nThere is an additional suggestion that C. concisus exists as a\nheterogeneous population with both pathogenic and non-patho-\ngenic strains co-existing together, with disease being manifest\nfollowing infection with a pathogenic genotype. This has been\nelegantly demonstrated by Aabenhus et al who utilized amplified\nfragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis from a variety of\nclinical isolates of C. concisus obtained from sixty-two immuno-\ncompetent and immunocompromised individuals over a period of\nfive years [32]. Their analysis showed at least four distinct C.\nconcisus genomospecies which exhibited differences in their spectra\nof virulence potential. In another similar study, analysis of SDS-\nPAGE protein profiles and PCR amplification of 23S rDNA\nassigned clinical C. concisus isolates into two distinct, but discordant\ngroups [33]. Identification of two genetically distinct clusters have\nalso been reported from a recent report utilizing analysis of\namplified fragment length polymorphism profiles [34]. This study\nFigure 2.

More importantly they\nfound that the pathogenic strains (genomospecies B) displayed\ngreater epithelial invasion and translocation. This is possibly the\nfirst report of a genotype-phenotype correlation of pathogenicity of\nC. concisus isolates. During the current study, phylogenetic analysis\nwas also undertaken to see if a similar clustering effect could be\nseen based on 16S rDNA sequence data. Our study cohort did not\ndemonstrate a similar clustering effect, indicating that 16S rDNA\nsequence data is not as discriminatory as 23S rDNA for\ncategorising C. concisus isolates. The debate on whether differing\nphenotypic characteristics of C. concisus can be identified by\nstudying genetic composition still needs to be resolved.\nIn comparison to C. concisus, C. ureolyticus is a relatively unknown\ngastrointestinal pathogen. In its previous nomenclature as\nBacteroides ureolyticus it was known to cause soft tissue infections\nand urethritis and it has only recently been implicated as a cause of\ndiarrhoea [22,35,36]. Its significant association with UC in our\nstudy suggests that these patients may be susceptible to\ncolonisation with Campylobacter and perhaps this is genus-specific\nrather than to any particular Campylobacter species. This is\nsupported by the increased number of mixed Campylobacter (with\nrelatively rare members of the Campylobacter genus, including C.\nshowae, C. curvus and C. gracilis) in adults with ulcerative colitis as\nopposed to controls. This finding is similar to those in paediatric\nCrohn\u2019s disease reported by Man et al [18]. The increased\ndiversity of Campylobacter species in UC may reflect a specific defect\nin the immunological handling of this genus in the intestinal\nmucosa of UC. The additional finding of mixed Helicobacteraceae\nand Campylobacter species in UC suggest that this defect may extend\nto the entire phylum of Proteobacteria.\nA sub-group analysis of the patients with UC was performed\nwhich found no definite relationship between extent of disease and\nthe prevalence of Campylobacter and specifically C. concisus. There\nwas a significantly lower prevalence of all Campylobacters in subjects\nwith severe colitis (50%) as opposed to moderate colitis (87.5%),\nbut no such difference was noted with the prevalence of C. concisus\ninfection. The obvious corollary to this finding is that our study did\nnot have the power to detect differences between the various sub-\ngroups of UC. This finding appears to be against the obvious\npremise that a greater exposure should generally lead to greater\nincidence of the effect. Contrary to this finding, a greater\nprevalence of Campylobacter species was noted in histologically\ninflamed biopsies as opposed to normal biopsy samples taken from\nUC patients. One can surmise that there can be regional changes\nin mucosal bacterial species, in this case Campylobacter, that may\ntrigger an inflammatory cascade which then leads to ulceration\nand loss of the epithelial surface that harbours these organisms.\nThis would paradoxically lead to reduced identification of the\npathogen in the most severe phases of active disease. Future studies\nshould also be conducted on non-IBD inflammatory colonic\ndiseases to ensure that the presence of the bacteria is not merely a\nsuperinfection of inflamed tissue.\nIn the classic essay by Bradford Hill on the theory of causation\nhe states that: \u2018\u2018We must not be too ready to dismiss a cause and\neffect hypothesis merely on the grounds that the observed\nassociation appears to be slight\u2019\u2019 [37]. This doctrine is all the\nmore relevant when considering the role of a solitary pathogen like\nC. concisus in the broader aetiopathogenesis of a multifactorial\ndisease like UC. The pathogenic potential of C. concisus has been\nelegantly demonstrated in an in-vitro model wherein these strains\nwere demonstrated to be invasive and also induced production of\npro-inflammatory cytokines from epithelial cells, monocytes and\nmacrophages [38]. A cytolethal distending toxin (CDT)-like effect\non Vero cells has been shown by clinical isolates of C. concisus from\nsubjects with diarrhoea [33]. The bacterium also produces cell-\nassociated and secreted haemolysins that may have a role in\npathogenicity [39]. It is obvious that this bacterium can cause\ntissue damage but whether it is the initiating trigger, the\nperpetuating factor or merely an epiphenomenon amidst the\nmucosal inflammatory cascade is a question that still needs to be\nanswered.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: IM JMT RH EMEO GLH.\nPerformed the experiments: IM JMT SHB.
