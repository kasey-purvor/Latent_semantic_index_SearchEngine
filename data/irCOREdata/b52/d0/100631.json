Introduction and theory\nSemiconductor quantum wells (QWs) are important components for future spintronic transistor\ndevice applications because the method for electrical manipulation of spin polarizations in\nsemiconductors is likely to be the Rashba effect [1]. Recently alternative methods for coherent\nspin control have been demonstrated using strain gradients [2] or composition gradients [3],\nwithout manipulation of QW symmetry. However, most investigations have concentrated on\ncontrol of the spin-splitting by a gate electric field, and observations of this effect have been\nmade using Shubnikov\u2013de Haas experiments [4], weak-antilocalization [5] and time-resolved\noptical experiments [6]. These experiments have all been performed on GaAs-based, and more\nrecently on InAs-based [16], structures. In the present work, we investigate the spin lifetime,\nand hence the ability to control the zero field spin splitting, in alternative, antimonide-based\nsemiconductors. In this case, the spin\u2013orbit coupling and hence the Rashba effect are stronger,\nresulting in a larger zero field spin splitting and spin relaxation rate. We have measured the spin\nrelaxation rate in InSb\/AlInSb QWs, and find that it is significantly faster than in GaAs-based\nwells, and comparable to the InAs rate.\nIn bulk n-type semiconductors, two main spin relaxation processes have been found to\nbe important in optical orientation experiments: the D\u2019yakonov\u2013Perel (DP) and the Elliott\u2013\nYafet (EY) mechanisms [7]\u2013[9]. Theoretical prediction indicates that for bulk III\u2013V n-type\nsemiconductors the transition temperature from the DP-dominated regime to the EY-dominant\nregime is at T\u223c5 K [8]. In support of this, the EY process has been found to be responsible for\nthe spin relaxation of electrons in bulk InSb at a temperature of T = 1.3 K [10, 11], whereas the\nDP process dominates at room temperature [12].\nFor QWs, only in the case of DP-dominated scattering will an electric field applied in the\ngrowth direction cause a modulation of the strength of the spin\u2013orbit coupling through the Rashba\neffect and hence also the rate of DP spin relaxation. This is an essential component for spintronic\ndevices requiring modulation of the spin lifetime with an electric field. It is therefore important\nto establish the conditions in which spin polarization lifetimes are both long and dominated by\nthe DP process.\nIt has been shown that for the GaAs\/AlGaAs QW system at room temperature the DP\nprocess is the dominant spin relaxation mechanism (for example, [13]\u2013[15]), as with the bulk\nmaterials. This is also true for the narrow gap system InAs\/GaSb (for example [6, 16]). On the\nother hand, in the intermediate bandgap system InGaAs\/InP it has been reported, but as yet not\nfully explained, that the EY mechanism is the strongest process [15]. We show in this work that\nthe mobility of the material can be important for determination of which mechanism dominates,\nat least in narrow gap semiconductor QWs, and that there is an optimum value of mobility\n(specific to a particular confinement energy) that gives the longest DP-dominated lifetime.\nThe EY process leads to spin relaxation due to mixing of the valence band states into\nthe conduction band, leading to a nonzero transition rate even for spin-conserving scattering\nprocesses. An expression for the spin relaxation rate for the EY process in a QW has been given\nby [15, 17]\n1\n\u03c4EYs\n= CEY\u03b72\n(\n1 \u2212 me\nm0\n)2\nE1e\nE2g\nkT\n1\n\u03c4p\n, (1)\nwhere me\/m0 is the electron effective mass ratio, E1e is the confinement energy for the lowest\nelectron subband, \u03b7 = \u0003\/(Eg + \u0003), Eg is the band gap and \u0003 is the spin\u2013orbit splitting energy.\nNew Journal of Physics 8 (2006) 49 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n3 Institute of Physics \u0001DEUTSCHE PHYSIKALISCHE GESELLSCHAFT\nThe orbital momentum scattering time \u03c4p is related to the mobility \u00b5 (assuming the electron\u2013\nelectron scattering rate is low compared with inelastic scattering) by \u03c4p = \u00b5me\/e. CEY is a\ndimensionless constant and is predicted to be of the order of unity.\nThe DP spin dephasing arises because spin\u2013orbit coupling removes spin degeneracy and\nprovides an effective magnetic field that causes the electron spin to precess at a rate determined\nby the splitting. For small k in bulk crystals this splitting can be written as \u0003E = \u03b3k3, where \u03b3\nis the Dresselhaus spin splitting coefficient [18]. For QWs, the spin splitting is linear in k and\nthe Rashba coefficient \u03b1c, related to the spin splitting, is given by [13]:\n\u03b3 = \u03b1c h\u00af3(2m3eEg)\u22121\/2, (2)\nwhere [8]\n\u03b1c \u2248 4\u03b7\u221a3 \u2212 \u03b7\nme\nm0\n.\nThe DP spin relaxation rate is\n1\n\u03c4DPs\n= CDP m\n3\ne(\u03b3E1e)\n2\nh\u00af8\nkBT\u03c4p = CDP \u03b1\n2\nc\n2\nE21e\nh\u00af2Eg\nkBT\u03c4p, (3)\nwhere again CDP is a dimensionless constant, predicted to be 16 [13]. Using equation (2) for\nInSb, \u03b1c = 0.045 which agrees well with other calculations [18].\nThe scaling of spin relaxation time with electron confinement energy can serve as a criterion\nfor distinguishing between the spin-relaxation mechanisms, assuming the momentum relaxation\ntime can be kept constant. It was shown that \u03c4S \u221d E\u22122.21e for two series of GaAs\/AlGaAs QWs,\nwhich is consistent with DP being the dominant spin-relaxation mechanism [15]. On the other\nhand, in the same work for a set of InGaAs\/InP QWs, it was found that \u03c4S \u221d E\u221211e , indicating\ndominance of EY. Moreover it was shown that at room temperature the observed magnitude of\nspin relaxation time in InGaAs\/InP QWs is smaller than the estimation based on the DP process\n[13], as expected for EY. It was suggested that the reason for the change of spin-relaxation\nmechanism is because the band gap of the InGaAs QWs was about half of that of the GaAs\nQWs, reducing \u03c4EYS via equation (1) [15]. It is clear from later work on narrow gap material (see,\nfor example, [16] and the present work) that this explanation is incomplete. Below we shall show\nthat for InSb QW samples, in spite of the band gap of InSb being more than four times narrower\nthan that of the InGaAs, the DP process dominates at room temperature for high mobility samples\n(as indeed has been shown previously for InAs QWs [16]).\n2. Experiment\nWe have investigated a set of InSb\/Al0.15In0.85Sb single QW samples grown by MBE on GaAs\nsubstrates. The mobility of all available QWs was measured by means of the Hall effect. The two\nsamples that exhibit the most strongly different temperature dependence of the mobility, shown\nin figure 1, were chosen for spin lifetime measurements. These QWs both have a well width of\n20 nm, but one was remotely n-doped with Te 20 nm above the well (me1833), and the other was\nuniformly Te-doped (me1831F).\nNew Journal of Physics 8 (2006) 49 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n4 Institute of Physics \u0001DEUTSCHE PHYSIKALISCHE GESELLSCHAFT\n1\n0.8\n5\n4\n3\n2\n40 60 80 100 300200\n\u00b5 \n(m\n 2 V\n\u2212\n1 \ns\u2212\n1 )\nTemperature (K)\nme1833\nme1831F\nFigure 1. Temperature dependence of the electron mobility for samples me1831F\nand me1833 (on logarithmic scales).\nThe two main scattering processes that determine the temperature dependence of the electron\nmobility are lattice scattering for which \u00b5 \u221d T\u22123\/2 and impurity scattering for which \u00b5 \u221d+3\/2.\nFitting a power law \u00b5 \u221d T x to the experimental mobility reveals that for the remotely doped\nsample x = \u22120.5, whereas for the uniformly doped sample x = 0.28, i.e. consistent with lattice\nscattering dominating in the former, and ionized impurity scattering dominating in the latter, as\nexpected. The carrier density for me1833 is 5.3 \u00d7 1011 cm\u22122 at 300 K and 3.6 \u00d7 1011 cm\u22122 at\n77 K. For me1831F it is 7.3 \u00d7 1011 cm\u22122 at 300 K and 5.7 \u00d7 1011 cm\u22122 at 77 K.\nWe measured the spin relaxation time by means of a circularly polarized pump-probe\nexperiment [9], [12]\u2013[17], [19]\u2013[23]. Our experimental setup is shown in figure 2. The probe\nbeam was circularly polarized using a variable quarter wave plate. A photo-elastic modulator\n(PEM) was used to modulate the pump, between the same circular polarization (SCP) as the\nprobe to the opposite circular polarization (OCP). The change in transmission of the probe beam\ndue to the modulation (i.e. the circular dichroism, \u0003TCD) was detected as a function of the time\ndelay between pump and probe pulses. The recombination time of photo-generated carriers was\nmeasured by simply replacing the PEM with an optical chopper. The change in transmission due\nto the chopping will be referred to as the linear polarization signal (\u0003TLP).All measurements were\nperformed using the output of a difference frequency generator (DFG, Coherent Inc.) pumped by\nboth the signal and the idler output of an infrared optical parametric amplifier. The DFG provides\npulses shorter than 100 fs duration at a repetition rate of 250 kHz. The wavelength of the laser\nradiation could be continuously tuned from 3 to 13 \u00b5m. In all cases, the pump and probe photon\nenergy was maintained just above the bandgap. The laser power before the beam splitter was\n4 mW. The intensity of the probe beam was a few percent of that of the pump beam. In order to\nobtain the spin relaxation time the ratio (\u0003TSCP\u0003TOCP)\/(\u0003TSCP + \u0003TOCP), which is equivalent\nto \u0003TCD\/\u0003TLP, should be fitted with an exponential decay. It was found that the spin relaxation\ntime is significantly shorter than the carrier lifetime obtained from the \u0003TLP signal. The carrier\nrecombination proceeds via the Auger process [23] and does not follow a single exponential\ndecay, but the fastest component measured was \u223c50 ps.

We have\nextracted spin relaxation times from \u0003TCD decay only.\n3. Discussion and conclusion\nExperimental results for the change in transmission of the probe beam due to the modulation\n(i.e. the circular dichroism, \u0003TCD) was detected as a function of the time delay between pump\nand probe pulses, as shown in figure 3.\nThe temperature dependence of the spin relaxation time obtained by fitting \u0003TCD with\nexponential decay is shown in figure 4 for both samples. Also shown on figure 4 are theoretical\npredictions for the variation of the lifetime with temperature from equations (1) and (3) using the\nexperimentally determined mobility from figure 1 (interpolated using the power law fit described\nabove). The scaling factors CDP and CEY were used as free parameters, though assumed to be\nsample independent, and the values used for the curves shown in figure 2 were 32 and 7.5\nrespectively (see below for discussion of this choice). The value of E1e was taken to be 0.08 eV,\nestimated from k.p calculations.\nIn order to determine which mechanism dominates the spin decay, we note that from\nequation (1) \u03c4EYS T \u221d \u00b5 assuming that the band gap and the electron effective mass are only\nslowly varying with temperature, whereas from equation (3), \u03c4DPS T \u221d \u00b5\u22121. A plot of \u03c4ST versus\n\u00b5 should therefore reveal which mechanism dominates. The spin relaxation time predicted by\nthe DP and the EY processes as well as experimental results for both samples are shown in\nfigure 5. For sample me1833, \u03c4ST is inversely proportional to \u00b5 and is perfectly well described\nby the DP process. The value of CDP obtained from the fit was 32, about twice that predicted by\n[13]. This may be due to built-in electric fields caused by the remote doping. Similar discrepancies\nin absolute magnitude with the simple theory have been reported elsewhere [13, 17, 21, 22], and\nmay be resolved by going to a more comprehensive theoretical treatment of the DP process [23].\nFor sample me1831F, at high temperature and the high mobility end of the range the dependence\nNew Journal of Physics 8 (2006) 49 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n6 Institute of Physics \u0001DEUTSCHE PHYSIKALISCHE GESELLSCHAFT\n0 1\n0\n1\n290 K\n77 K\u2206T\nCD\nTime delay (ps)\nFigure 3.

At lower temperature and mobility, the EY process appears\nto become comparable to the DP process and a clear distinction cannot be made.\nIn the light of their experimental results, in [13] it was suggested that the efficiency of EY\nprocess could become much more significant in narrow band gap semiconductors, as can be seen\nfrom equation (1). However, DP also becomes faster from equation (3), and the cross-over from\nEY to DP dominated regimes occurs when\n\u03c4X =\n(\nCEY\nCDP\n3 \u2212 \u03b7\n8\nh\u00af2\nE1eEg\n)1\/2 (\nm0\nme\n\u2212 1\n)\n, (4)\nwhich is not explicitly temperature-dependent.

Because E1e \u221d L\u22122, \u03c4s max scales with L3 (from\nequation (5)) so strong increases in spin lifetime can be achieved with small increases in well\nwidth. Similarly, changing from InSb wells to InAs wells is predicted to increase the maximum\nspin lifetime by about an order of magnitude. From equation (4), DP can be expected to dominate\nat room temperature even in narrow gap QWs unless the mobility is low.\nWe would like to stress that the DP lifetime can be tuned by application of a vertical electric\nfield (in a way that depends on growth direction [25]), which changes the magnitude of the\nNew Journal of Physics 8 (2006) 49 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n8 Institute of Physics \u0001DEUTSCHE PHYSIKALISCHE GESELLSCHAFT\nstructural (Rashba) inversion asymmetry and hence also CDP. The attractiveness of narrow gap\nsemiconductors for spintronics comes from the large predicted Rashba effect, i.e. the strong\ntuning of \u03c4s with field, and the consequent faster switching and lower power consumption [26].\nIn conclusion, we have investigated the temperature and mobility dependence of spin\nrelaxation time in narrow gap antimonide single QWs. It was found that simple models of\nspin-relaxation processes give good agreement between theory and experimental results and\nallow us to conclude that the DP process is the dominant spin-relaxation mechanism for the\ntemperature range from 290 to 77 K for high mobility material. This is important for spintronic\napplications since in this case an electric field applied in the growth direction causes a modulation\nof the strength of the spin\u2013orbit coupling and hence also the rate of DP spin dephasing. However,\nthe EY process begins to become important with low mobility material at low temperature. EY\nspin-flip scattering is not modulated strongly by the electric field, and it is therefore important to\nestablish the conditions in which spin polarization lifetimes are both long and dominated by the\nDP process. We show in this work that it is the mobility of the material that is important for the\ndetermination of which dominates in narrow gap antimonide QWs, and that there is an optimum\nvalue of mobility that gives the longest DP-dominated lifetime.\nAcknowledgment\nWe are grateful for partial support from the EU FENIKS project (EC: G5RD-CT-2001-00535),\nand from the UK EPSRC (EP\/C511999).\nReferences\n[1] Rashba E I and Efros A L 2003 Phys.
