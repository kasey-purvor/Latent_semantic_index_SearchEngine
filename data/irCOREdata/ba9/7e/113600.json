In general,\nthe occupancy is not directly observable, but it is reflected\ngeneralized Coulomb-energy shift [7] to be 0.40(6) MeV,\nso with the lowest excited states in the mirror, 31Al,The nuclear shell model pictures deeply bound nucle-\nons as being in fully occupied states. At and above the\nsurface of the Fermi sea, configuration mixing then leads\nto occupancies that gradually decrease to zero. This pic-\nture is modified in an important way by several correla-\ntion effects that are absent from or are described only\napproximately by effective-interaction theories, such as\nthe shell model. These correlations arise from short-\nrange, soft-core, and tensor nucleon-nucleon (NN) inter-\nactions and from longer-range couplings involving\nlow-lying and giant resonance collective excitations [1].\nThey result in the physical nucleon occupancies of deeply\nbound states being reduced and the strength shifted into\nstates up to quite high energies; see Pandharipande et al.\n[2]. Absolute measurements of nucleon occupancies may\ntherefore quantify these correlation effects. It should be\npointed out that nuclear reaction observables probing the\nspatial behavior of the nucleonic wave functions agree\nwell with the shell model picture. Examples are the\ncharacteristic angular distributions of transfer reactions\nand the longitudinal momentum distributions of the resi-\ndues in knockout reactions, which identify the orbital\nangular momentum l of the nucleon states involved.\nThe main body of evidence on nucleon occupancies has\ncome from studies of the \u0001e; e0p\u0002 reaction [2,3]. These\nhave shown that in stable nuclei over a broad mass region,\nthe valence proton states have their occupancies quenched\nby factors of order 0.6\u20130.7 relative to the extreme single-\nparticle values. Recently, evidence has emerged that nu-\ncleon knockout reactions with heavy ions, at intermediate\nenergies and in inverse kinematics, offer new possibilities\nfor studying these effects by extending measurements to0031-9007=04=93(4)=042501(4)$22.50 \uf6d9in the spectroscopic factor C2Sj that measures the overlap\nof the initial and final states with quantum numbers (l; j)\n[4]. The reduction factor Rs is defined as the ratio of the\nexperimental and theoretical value for the spectroscopic\nfactor, the latter obtained when the valence nucleons are\nconfined to a single major oscillator shell, the sd shell for\nthe cases discussed here. This is consistent with how the\nreduction factors are defined in the analysis of \u0001e; e0p\u0002\nreactions on closed-proton-shell nuclei. While the first\nknockout results for well-bound nuclei [4] were in line\nwith those found elsewhere, the Rs values for the weakly\nbound protons in 8B and 9C [5] were close to unity,\nsuggesting a marked dependence on the nucleon separa-\ntion energy. In the present work this hypothesis is exam-\nined by measuring Rs for a deeply bound neutron. In\ndoing so we exploit the large asymmetry in the Fermi\nenergies of neutron and proton states in nuclei near the\ndrip lines; see Fig. 1. This is an experimental option that is\nunique to a rare-isotope accelerator.\nThe 9Be\u000132Ar; 31Ar\u0002X reaction leads to the lightest\nbound argon isotope. The neutron separation energy Sn\nis not known experimentally, but an accurate estimate of\n21.99(5) MeV can be obtained by adding a generalized\nCoulomb-energy shift, the quantity D1 of Ref. [7], to the\nproton separation energy of 32Si, the mirror nucleus. As a\ntest we calculate in the same way Sn for the 32;33Ar pair to\nbe 15.246 MeV, in excellent agreement with the new\nexperimental value of 15.255 MeV [8]. The spin of 31Ar\nis known to be 52\n\u0003 from measurements of the recoil-\nenergy shift in beta-delayed proton emission [9], and\nthis is also the spin of the mirror nucleus 31Al [10].

Calculations with the universal\nsd-shell (USD) effective interaction [12,13] give 0 MeV\n(52\u0003), 0.94 MeV (12\u0003) and 1.74 MeV (32\u0003), and C2Sj of 4.12,\n0.37, and 0.08, respectively.\nSince the dominant knockout strength will popu-\nlate the only bound state, an accurate determination of\nthe reduction can be obtained from the inclusive reac-\ntion cross section. A secondary beam of 32Ar was\nproduced in fragmentation of a 36Ar primary beam of\n150 MeV=nucleon from the Coupled-Cyclotron Facility\nof the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory\n(NSCL). Following the 1034 mg=cm2 primary 9Be\nfragmentation target, the beam was purified in the\nA1900 large-acceptance fragment separator [14]. The\nsecondary beam with an average midtarget energy of\n65:1 MeV=nucleon interacted with 188\u00014\u0002 mg=cm2 of\n9Be located at the target position of the high-resolution\nS800 spectrograph [15]. The identification of the re-\naction products after the secondary target was performed\nusing the focal-plane detector system [16] of the mag-\nnetic spectrograph in conjunction with scintillators\nalong the beam line. The intensity of 32Ar projectiles on\ntarget was approximately 140 s\u00051. The knockout resi-\ndues were identified on an event-by-event basis from\nthe time of flight between scintillators monitoring the\nbeam, the energy loss in the ionization chamber, and the\nposition and angle information provided by the position-\nsensitive cathode readout drift counters in the S800 focal\nplane [16].\n042501-2The parallel-momentum distributions shown in Fig. 2\nwere obtained with the ion-optics code COSY [17]. The\ndata were corrected for acceptance, those data points\nwith the correction exceeding a factor of 1.5 being re-\njected. The theoretical momentum distributions were\ncalculated in a black-disk model [18,19] and folded\nwith the measured response function. These clearly iden-\ntify the reaction as an l \u0006 2 knockout confirming the 52\u0003\nassignment. The experimental cross section \u0011exp \u0006\n10:4\u000113\u0002 mb emerges from the number of residues relative\nto incoming projectiles and the density of the 9Be reac-\ntion target. Uncertainties arise from the software gates\nused for particle identification (10%), the correction for\nthe momentum acceptance of the S800 spectrograph\n(2.5%), and the purity and stability of the incoming\nbeam (5%) and have been added in quadrature to the\nstatistical error.

The single-particle (unit)\ncross section \u0011sp, corresponding to a normalized single-\nnucleon wave function [20,21], is calculated as outlined in\nthe following to be 9.89 mb. Thus we obtain Rs \u0006 0:24\u00013\u0002,\na surprisingly low value. It is clearly important to exam-\nine the calculation of the unit cross section carefully.\nThe simple and accurate description of knockout\ncross sections in eikonal theory is linked to the surface\ndominance of the reaction mechanism, which elimi-\nnates the need to specify the motion of fast nucleons in\nthe nuclear interior. The strength of the interactions is\ndefined from the experimental NN cross sections [20].\nHowever, only about 4% of the single-particle wave\nfunction is sampled in the reaction, an estimate based\non the ratio of the stripping cross section to the 284 mb042501-2\n0 5 10 15 20 25\nNucleon Separation Energy  [MeV]\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nR\ned\nuc\ntio\nn \nFa\nct\nor\n R\ns\n-n\n-p\n22O\n32Ar\nFIG. 3.

This leads us to\nconsider the assumed density distribution of the residue\nand the neutron-residue relative-motion wave function. A\nconsistent description is obtained from self-consistent\nHartree-Fock (HF) calculations based on a Skyrme pa-\nrametrization, which offers quantitative agreement with\nexperiment for parameters related to nuclear size. We use\nthe recent SKX parameter set [6], determined from a\nlarge set of data on spherical nuclei, including nuclei\nfar from stability, and which accounts for the binding-\nenergy differences of mirror nuclei [22], interaction cross\nsections [23], and nuclear charge distributions [24]. This\nagreement suggests that the theory will also give a good\ndescription of individual single-particle states. Because\nof the sensitivity of the \u0011sp to the nucleon separation\nenergy Sn, the central potential of the HF calculation is\nscaled (by a number near unity) to reproduce Sn for the\nstate required, ensuring the correct large-distance\nasymptotic behavior of the wave function.\nUnderstanding these sensitivities is simplified by the\nobservation [19] that the key variable is the root-mean-\nsquared (rms) separation Rsp of the removed nucleon and\nthe residue in the projectile, while details of the shape of\nits binding potential are less important. The connection\nbetween Rsp and the HF radius, which is measured from a\nfixed center, is\nR2sp \u0006\n\u0001\nA\nA\u0005 1\n\u0002\nhr2iHF: (2)\nThe HF calculation shows that 31Ar has a pronounced\nproton skin so that the removal of the 0d5=2 neutron by\nthe neutron-excess target takes place in an environment\ndominated by protons; see the density distributions in\nFig. 1.

The\n042501-3two approaches give 9.89 and 9.98 mb. The contribution\nfrom diffraction dissociation is 20% of this. Using instead\na two-parameter Fermi distribution with the same rms\nradius R\u0001r\u0002 we obtain 9.68 mb. Consequently, the proton\nskin and even the precise shape of the density distribution\nare not critical for the unit cross section.

The expression shows\nthat a 0.1 fm error on Rsp and R\u0001r\u0002 translates into an\nuncertainty of about 15%; the contributions from the\ntarget radius R\u0001t\u0002 and the bound-state-potential diffuse-\nness a are small.\nThe neutron-skin nucleus 22O, also with 14 neutrons,\noffers an interesting comparison. The theoretical spectro-\nscopic factor to the 52\n\u0003 ground state of 21O is 5.22, larger\nthan in the 32Ar case because 22O is essentially a doubly\nmagic structure. Theory suggests that this branch ac-\ncounts for 92% of the cross section, the rest going to\ntwo states below the neutron threshold of approximately\n3.8 MeV. Therefore, it is meaningful to deduce Rs from\nthe inclusive one-neutron knockout cross section. Two\nmeasurements on a 12C target [25] give 120(14) mb at\n51 MeV=nucleon and 70(9) mb at 938 MeV=nucleon. The\ntheoretical cross sections for this neutron-skin nucleus, of\n139 and 116 mb, lead to an average value of Rs of 0.70(6),\nwell above the result for 32Ar with the same number of\nneutrons but ten protons more.\nThe systematics in Fig. 3 suggests that the reduction\nfactor Rs is strongly correlated with the nucleon separa-\ntion energy, in turn linked to the nuclear symmetry\nenergy. This raises the interesting question of spec-\ntroscopic factors in very asymmetric nuclear matter.

The factor 1=2 reflects that the Pauli principle\nfavors the neutron-proton interaction. The parameter \u0019s\nlinks density and asymmetry effects. With Hartree-Fock\ndensities, we obtain for 8B, 15C, 22O, and 32Ar the relative\nvalues 0.19, 0.33, 0.47, and 0.68, respectively, reminiscent\nof the trend in Fig. 3. However, hard-core contributions\nmay only be part of the large reduction [1,2].\nHigh separation energies are also encountered for\ndeep-hole states in nuclei near stability. For example,\nthe reaction 116Sn\u0001d; t\u0002115Sn [28] revealed broad giant-\nresonance-like distributions near 6 MeV excitation en-\nergy, corresponding to an effective neutron separation\nenergy of 15 MeV. These resonances had angular distri-\nbutions characteristic of the 1p1=2;3=2 and 0g9=2 states, and\nthe observed strength was 0.2 to 0.3 of the sum-rule value.\nThis reduction is similar to our result for the single final\nstate in 31Ar at the Fermi surface of 32Ar. This strong\nreduction in strength for deep-hole states in 116Sn was\nattributed to the coupling of the single-particle states to\ncollective motion [28]. Collective couplings and short-\nrange correlations are clearly both interesting pieces of\nthe 32Ar theoretical puzzle.\nFinally, it is important to note that the low occupancy\nof physical nucleons in the quasiparticle states that make\nup the description of 32Ar does not seem to be linked to a\nbreakdown of the model for its structure. In fact, all\nevidence for the \u0001A; T\u0002 \u0006 \u000131; 5=2\u0002 and \u000132; 2\u0002 nuclei sup-\nports the assumption that these are good sd-shell nuclei.\nThe spins, energy spectra, and beta decay properties of\nthe mirror nuclei 31Al and 32Si are well accounted for\n[11,29]. The Gamow-Teller beta decay of 32Ar has been\nstudied with high resolution [30] and both the distribu-\ntion of the beta strength (up to 8 MeV excitation energy)\nand the renormalization of the axial-vector coupling con-\nstant are in line with with theoretical calculations.\nIn summary, the 9Be\u000132Ar; 31Ar\u0002X reaction with a neu-\ntron separation energy of 22.0 MeV leads to a nucleus\nsituated at the proton drip line with only one bound state.\nThe empirical reduction factor Rs is unexpectedly small,\nwhich may be linked to the very asymmetric nuclear\nmatter in 31Ar. Experiments on other deeply bound states\ncan help to clarify the origin of this effect.\nWe thank Francesco Iachello and Achim Richter for\nstimulating discussions.
