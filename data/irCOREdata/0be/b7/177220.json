A slightly less\nrigorously defined measure, resting metabolic rate in the\nthermoneutral zone (RMRt), relaxes the need for the animals to be\nnon-reproductive and post-absorptive (Speakman et al., 2004). This\nlatter definition overcomes the semantic difficulty of being unable\nto measure the BMR of an animal when it is reproducing, and also\ncircumvents the problem of animals suppressing their metabolic rate\nwhen they are food deprived to make them post-absorptive\n(Speakman et al., 2004). Although BMR, and RMRt, were defined\nwith the objective of establishing a standardised measurement for\nmetabolism, they are highly variable between different species, even\nof the same body mass (e.g. Hemmingsen, 1960; Dawson and\nHulbert, 1970; McNab, 1980; McNab, 2002; Henneman, 1983;\nHayssen, 1984; Hayssen and Lacy, 1985; Ricklefs et al., 1996;\nLovegrove, 2000).\nIn addition to high variation between species, it has become\napparent that BMR and RMRt are also highly variable between\nindividuals within species (e.g. Bech et al., 1999; Jackson et al.,\n2001; Johnson et al., 2001a; Weyer et al., 2000; Speakman et al.,\n2003; Rfnning et al., 2005; Johnston et al., 2007; Sadowska et al.,\n2007). Everything else being equal, higher levels of BMR or RMRt\nwould demand greater levels of food intake. Hence, if one considers\ntwo individuals, one with a high, and one with a low BMR, the\nindividual with the high BMR would need to consume more energy\neach day to support its higher metabolic rate. Alternatively, if the\ntwo animals ingested the same energy, the one with the lower BMR\nwould have more energy available to allocate to other activities such\nas reproduction (Gadgil and Bossert, 1980). Attempts to understand\nthe inter-specific and inter-individual variability in BMR have\ntherefore focussed on trying to discern advantages that might accrue\nto animals with high BMR levels (e.g. Labocha et al., 2004;\nSpeakman, 2008).\nThe sustained maximum metabolic rate (SusMR) is the maximum\nrate of energy expenditure that an animal can sustain for a protracted\nperiod of time, without dependence on stored energy reserves. In\nmany situations it is equivalent to the maximal sustained rate at\nwhich energy can be ingested and assimilated (maximal sustained\nenergy intake SusEI) (Speakman and Krol, 2005). Like BMR and\nRMRt, SusMR and SusEI are highly variable between species and\nbetween individuals within species. SusEI may be limited by the\nextrinsic supply of energy from the environment (e.g. Speakman et\nal., 2003). However, animals may often be limited by aspects of\ntheir intrinsic physiology. An idea that emerged in the 1980s was\nthat the maximum rates at which animals can ingest or expend energy\nmight be linked to their BMRs (Drent and Daan, 1980). The basis\nof this idea was that SusMR and SusEI are ultimately limited by\nthe capacity of the alimentary tract to absorb and process nutrients\nfrom the environment (Kirkwood, 1983; Tolkamp et al., 2002). An\nalimentary tract and associated organs (such as the liver) that can\nprocess energy faster will make more energy available to support\nSusMR. However, these larger and\/or more metabolically active\ntissues will be reflected in a higher BMR. Hence, greater capacities\nfor SusMR and SusEI would necessitate a bigger alimentary system\nthat would require a higher BMR (Drent and Daan, 1980; Weiner,\nThe Journal of Experimental Biology 213, 278-287\nPublished by The Company of Biologists 2010\ndoi:10.1242\/jeb.037069\nLimits to sustained energy intake XII: is the poor relation between resting metabolic\nrate and reproductive performance because resting metabolism is not a repeatable\ntrait?\nL. C. Duarte, L. M. Vaanholt, R. E. Sinclair, Y. Gamo and J. R. Speakman*\nInstitute of Biological and Environmental Sciences, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen AB24 2TZ, UK\n*Author for correspondence (j.speakman@abdn.ac.uk)\nAccepted 24 September 2009\nSUMMARY\nMany studies have investigated the consequences of individual variation in resting metabolic rate at thermoneutrality (RMRt) on\nreproductive performance. Despite strong theoretical reasons for expecting such an association, results have generally been\ndisappointing. A fundamental assumption of these studies is that RMRt is a repeatable trait. We examined repeatability of RMRt\nin female MF1 mice over short (15\uf020days apart; N\uf03d238) and long intervals (110\uf020days apart; N\uf03d33). In the long-term experiment, after\nthe first RMRt measurement, females were separated in two groups: the first was kept virgin (N\uf03d16); the second was allowed to\nbreed (N\uf03d17) and measured 15\uf020days after they had weaned their pups. We also examined the association between RMRt and\nreproduction. We used Pearson\u2019s correlation (r) and intraclass correlation coefficients (\uf072) to estimate repeatability. There was a\nstrong effect of body mass on RMRt for all measurements. Over the short interval, repeatability was significant for body mass\n(r\uf03d0.86; \uf072\uf03d0.86), RMRt (r\uf03d0.68; \uf072\uf03d0.68,) and residual-RMRt (r\uf03d0.58; \uf072\uf03d0.58). Over long intervals, repeatability of residual-RMRt was\nhigh in virgin females (r\uf03d0.59; \uf072\uf03d0.60), but not in the breeders (r\uf03d0.38; \uf072\uf03d0.39); body mass was repeatable only for non-breeders\nmeasured by r (r\uf03d0.55). There was no significant correlation between RMRt or residual-RMRt and litter size or litter mass. In\nconclusion, RMRt and residual-RMRt are highly repeatable traits in virgin MF1 female mice. The lack of association between non-\nreproductive RMRt and reproductive performance in MF1 mice does not come about because of its poor repeatability.\nKey words: Mus musculus, repetability, resting metabolic rate, mouse, reproductive performance.\nTHE JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY\n279Repeatability of RMR\n1989; Weiner, 1992; Peterson et al., 1990; Hammond and Diamond,\n1992; Hammond and Diamond, 1997; Lovegrove, 2000). Although\nthe first ideas were that SusMR and BMR might be linked via the\nenergy acquisition system, it was later recognized that links between\nthe two might also come about because of commonality in the\ndemands of the tissues where energy is ultimately utilized. If the\ntissues involved in energy utilisation have high rates of energy\ndemand in the basal state, then a similar functional linkage between\ntissues, BMR (RMRt), SusMR and SusEI would emerge.\nLactation is one of the most energetically demanding periods in\nthe lives of small rodents (reviewed by Speakman, 2008; Naya et\nal., 2008). Many studies have been performed comparing RMRt of\nlactating animals to non-breeding individuals (Hammond and\nDiamond, 1992; Hammond and Diamond, 1994; Hammond et al.,\n1994; Hammond et al., 1996; Konarzewski and Diamond, 1995;\nRogowitz and McClure, 1995; Rogowitz, 1998; Speakman and\nMcQueenie, 1996; Johnson and Speakman, 2001; Johnson et al.,\n2001a; Johnson et al., 2001b; Johnson et al., 2001c; Speakman et\nal., 2001; Kr\u00f3l and Speakman, 2003a; Kr\u00f3l and Speakman, 2003b;\nKr\u00f3l et al., 2003; Kr\u00f3l et al., 2007). These studies are consistent\nwith the idea that BMR (RMRt) and SusMR (SusEI) should be\nclosely associated. Moreover, this association is also consistent with\nchanges in aspects of morphology that may limit either uptake of\nenergy or its utilisation. Lactating mice have bigger alimentary tracts,\nbigger livers and bigger mammary glands than non-breeding mice.\nThey also have greater RMRt, SusEI and SusMR. Such associations\nare also apparent between BMR and reproductive performance when\ncomparisons are made across species (Glazier, 1985a; Glazier,\n1985b; Genoud, 1988).\nIf the hypothesis associating high BMR (or RMRt) to high SusMR\n(and SusEI) is correct, we would expect the same associations to\nbe found between individuals that vary in their BMR. However, at\nthis inter-individual level the data are far more equivocal. Daan et\nal. (Daan et al., 1989; Daan et al., 1990a) indicated that residual\nvariability in BMR was associated with variations in the sizes of\norgans that would be expected to be the most energy demanding.\nMany other studies, however, have failed to find such links (Koteja,\n1996; Corp et al., 1997; Burness et al., 1998; Geluso and Hayes,\n1999). At peak lactation there is a very weak correlation between\nRMRt and SusEI, but this disappears when the shared variation due\nto body mass is removed (Johnson et al., 2001a). Moreover, many\nstudies have looked for, but failed to establish any significant\nassociations between individual variation in RMRt and reproductive\nperformance (Derting and McClure, 1989; Earle and Lavigne, 1990;\nHayes et al., 1992a; Stephenson and Racey, 1993a; Stephenson and\nRacey, 1993b; Johnston et al., 2001a; Kr\u00f3l et al., 2003c).\nOne potential reason why our previous studies of sustained energy\nintake using the MF1 (and C57BL\/6) mice have failed to establish\nsignificant links between RMRt, SusEI and reproductive\nperformance is that RMRt might not be repeatable in this mouse\nstrain. Repeatability is clearly a key aspect of any trait that we\nconsider has been a target for selection, as it places an upper limit\non the possible heritability (Falconer and Mackay, 1996). Previous\nstudies have suggested that BMR is a repeatable trait in different\nspecies of birds and mammals (Bech et al., 1999; Labocha et al.,\n2004; Sadowska et al., 2005; V\u00e9zina and Williams, 2005; Versteegh\net al., 2008) (reviewed by Nespolo and Franco, 2007; Versteegh et\nal., 2008; Boratynski and Koteja, 2008; Broggi et al., 2009).\nHowever, other studies have failed to detect significant repeatability\nfor BMR in some species (Russell and Chappell, 2007; Bozinovic,\n2007) pointing to the necessity of experimental verification. In the\ncurrent paper we first explored short-term repeatability of RMRt in\nMF1 mice by measuring RMRt twice with a 15\uf020day interval between\nmeasurements. To assess the effect of reproduction, we compared\nrepeatability of RMRt over the longer term (110\uf020days between\nmeasurements) of two groups of mice; in one group all females\nwere kept virgins (non-breeding group) and in the other, the first\nand the second measurements of RMRt were separated by one\nreproductive event (breeding group). We used RMRt rather than\nBMR because this is the trait previous studies have used to try and\nidentify associations between resting metabolism and reproductive\nperformance.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nVirgin female mice (Mus musculus L.: outbred strain MF1) were\npurchased from Harlan UK Ltd, Oxon, UK at 6\uf020weeks of age in\nseven separate batches. After 1\uf020week of acclimation to their new\nsurroundings following transport, they were housed individually in\nshoebox cages with sawdust and paper bedding. The lights were\nmaintained on a 12\uf020h:12\uf020h L:D photoperiod (lights on at 07:00\uf020h)\nand the ambient temperature was regulated at 21\u00b11\u00b0C. Animals\nreceived pelleted rodent food [CRM(P), Special Diet Services, BP\nNutrition, UK] and water ad libitum.\nProtocol evaluation\nProtocols for the measurement of BMR and RMRt are similar across\nall studies but vary in their exact details. Individuals are generally\nplaced in a respirometry chamber (of variable volume) for a period\nof some hours, with (BMR) or without (RMRt) a variable prior\nperiod of food (and occasionally water) deprivation. Measurements\nwhile the animals are in the chamber may be almost continuous,\nor, if the gas analyser alternates between several chambers may be\nintermittent. In this latter case the cycle of measurement generally\ndepends on how many chambers are in the system. The final BMR\nor RMRt measurement is defined as the lowest metabolism during\nthe entire measurement over some pre-defined period, normally of\nseveral minutes. In our laboratory we do not deprive the mice of\nfood prior to measurement and continuously measure them for 3\uf020h\n(without food or water in the chamber) at 30\u00b0C, taking a\nmeasurement every 30\uf020s. We use the lowest 10 consecutive measures\n(5\uf020min) as the estimate of RMRt (e.g. Selman et al., 2001). Hayes\net al. (Hayes et al., 1992b) showed that even if animals are at rest,\nif metabolism is a normally distributed trait with a fixed mean and\nstandard deviation, the measured BMR or RMRt will depend on\nthe exact protocol parameters (total measurement duration, sampling\ninterval and integrated duration for measurement). Differences in\nrepeatability between studies may in part reflect the exact protocols\nfor measurement. There is, however, an additional complication.\nCareau et al. (Careau et al., 2008) suggested that there are links\nbetween behaviour of individuals in respirometry chambers and their\npersonalities. Some individuals may have \u2018restless personalities\u2019 and\nnever settle in the chamber, whereas others may calm down\nrelatively quickly. These personality differences might precipitate\nan illusion of repeatability in the measurement because a restless\nmouse would be restless in all repeated measures and a calm one\nwould be calm in all measures.\nTo remotely monitor the behaviour of mice during our standard\nprotocols, sixteen 6-month-old MF1 mice (eight male and eight\nfemales) were implanted intraperitoneally with temperature\ntransmitters (PDT-4000 E-Mitter, Mini Mitter Company Inc.,\nUSA) under general anaesthesia (a mixture of isoflorane and\noxygen). Mice were allowed at least 3\uf020weeks to recover from the\nsurgery before measuring their metabolism. Transponder\nenergizers (ER-4000 Receiver, Mini Mitter Company Inc., USA)\nTHE JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY\n280\nwere placed under the respirometry chambers allowing us to non-\ninvasively monitor the body temperature and general activity\nthroughout the respirometry measurements using the VitalView\u00ae\nData Acquisition System [Mini Mitter Company, Inc., Bend, OR,\nUSA; see Harkin, for detailed description (Harkin, 2002)].\nInstrumented animals were placed in respirometry chambers and\noxygen consumption, body temperature and general activity were\nmeasured using our standard protocol (details below).\nResting metabolic rate (RMRt)\nResting metabolic rate (RMRt) was measured using four open-\nflow respiratory systems as described previously (Hayes et al.,\n1992b; Speakman and McQueenie, 1996). All measurements were\nmade during the day between 09:00 and 17:00\uf020h (2\uf020h after normal\nlights on and before lights off) and started either in the morning\naround 09:00\uf020h or in the afternoon around 13:30\uf020h. In this system,\nfresh air was pumped (Charles Austin Pumps Ltd, Byfleet, UK)\nthrough a sealed Perspex chamber (volume 1155\uf020ml) within an\nincubator (INL-401N010; Gallenkamp, Loughborough, UK) set\nat 30\u00b0C [within the thermal neutral zone for these mice (Speakman\nand Rossi, 1999)]. Mass-flow controllers (MKS Instruments UK,\nCheshire, UK) provided 500\u2013700\uf020ml\uf020min\u20131 which was monitored\nusing a wet type laboratory gas flow meter (Model DM3A; G. H.\nZeal Ltd, Alexander Wright Division, London, UK). Air leaving\nthe animal chamber was dried using silica gel and 150\uf020ml\uf020min\u20131\nwas passed through a gas analyser (Servomex 1100A or Servomex\nXentra, Servomex Ltd, Crowborough, UK). CO2 was not absorbed\nprior to gas analysis as this maximizes the accuracy of energy\nexpenditure measures when RQ is unknown (Koteja, 1996).\nOxygen concentrations were measured continuously, and averaged\nvalues were stored every 30\uf020s for 180\uf020min. RMRt was quantified\nas the oxygen consumption over the lowest 10 consecutive values\n(5\uf020min), excluding periods that included transient drops in the\nmeasurements (see below). Volumes were corrected for\ntemperature and pressure, using the appropriate equation (Hill,\n1972). The RMRt data (ml\uf020O2\uf020min\u20131) were converted to energy\nequivalents using an oxycalorific value of 21.1\uf020J\uf020ml\u20131\uf020O2 derived\nfrom the Weir equation (Weir, 1949). Body mass was measured\nbefore and after each run and the mean value was used in further\nanalysis.\nRepeatability measurements\nThe short-term repeatability of RMRt was estimated by making two\nmeasurements of 238 animals, split in seven batches. The first\nmeasurement was carried out at an age of 70\u00b110\uf020days and the second\nmeasurement was made 15\u00b15\uf020days later. In the long-term\nrepeatability experiment, a group of 33 individual mice was used,\non which two measurements of RMRt were carried out; one at\n70\u00b110\uf020days of age and the second measurement at 180\u00b13\uf020days of\nage. To explore the effects of reproduction on repeatability of RMRt,\nmice from the long-term experiment were divided into two different\ngroups. The first group (N\uf03d16) was never bred (the non-breeding\ngroup) and the second group (N\uf03d17) was bred at 115\uf020days of age\n(i.e. after the first RMRt measurement; the breeding group). Females\nfrom the breeding group were paired polygamously (one male to\ntwo females). Pregnancy was detected by an increase in body mass.\nThe sexes were kept together for about 10\uf020days, depending on\nwhether or not females gained weight significantly. After removing\nmales, the females were housed in individual cages and checked\ntwice a day to determine the day of parturition. Numbers of pups\nand their mass were recorded daily until weaning (21\uf020days after\nparturition). After weaning females were housed in groups of three\nL. C. Duarte and others\nor four until the second measurement of RMRt was carried out,\nabout 14\uf020days later.\nReproductive output\nWe measured litter size and litter mass at weaning for the 17 mice\nthat were bred in the long-term repeatability experiment.\nData analysis\nThe body mass and RMRt variables were log-transformed before\nanalysis to normalize them. The same statistical analysis was applied\nto the three sets of repeatability data, i.e. the short-term analysis\nand the long-term analysis for both breeding and non-breeding\nfemales. Repeatability of RMRt was assessed by Pearson\u2019s product\nmoment correlation coefficient r, and the coefficient of intraclass\ncorrelation (\uf072) (Sokal and Rohlf, 1981; Lessells and Boag, 1987).\nIn the intraclass correlation the observed mean squares (MS) from\nan analysis of variance are decomposed to estimate the within and\namong individual variance. The intraclass correlation coefficient (\uf072)\nis given by:\nwhere SA2 is the among group variance component and S2 is the within\ngroup variance component. These variance components are\ncalculated from the mean squares within (MSW) and mean squares\namong (MSA) individuals in the analysis of variance; S2\uf03dMSW and\nSA2\uf03d(MSA\u2013MSW)\/N0 (Sokal and Rohlf, 1981; Lessells and Boag,\n1987) where N0 is related to sample size. When N0\uf03d2, the intra-\nclass correlation varies between \u20131, when the trait is completely\nunrepeatable and all the variance resides within individuals (MSA\uf03d0)\nand +1 when the trait is perfectly repeatable and all the variance\nresides among individuals (MSW\uf03d0). At higher values of N0 the upper\nboundary, when MSW\uf03d0, remains at +1, but the lower boundary\nwhen MSA\uf03d0 increases above \u20131, but is still always less than 0 [see\nfigure\uf0201 in Lessells and Boag (Lessells and Boag, 1987)]. Both\ncoefficients (\uf072 and r) were used to estimate repeatability of residual\nRMRt obtained from a linear regression of log RMRt on log body\nmass. In an initial analysis we included time of day (morning or\nafternoon) and measurement machine (n\uf03d1\u20134) as random factors,\nbut neither were significant and were eliminated from further\nanalyses. A repeated measures general linear model (GLM) with\nbody mass as covariate was used to compare trials. Least squares\nlinear regression was used to determine if there were relationships\nbetween litter mass and litter size at weaning, and both RMRt and\nresidual RMRt. Repeated measures analysis was carried out using\nSPSS-17.0; coefficient of intraclass correlation (\uf072) was calculated\nfollowing procedures described by Sokal and Rohlf (Sokal and\nRohlf, 1981) and Lessells and Boag (Lessells and Boag, 1987); all\nother analyses were performed using MINITAB\u00ae15.0.\nRESULTS\nAs soon as mice were placed into the chamber, they showed a period\nof elevated metabolism, physical activity and high body temperature\n(Fig.\uf0201A\u2013D). This period lasted for about 60\u201390\uf020min. The mice then\nsettled down and became inactive. These periods of inactivity\ncorresponded to periods of stable low oxygen consumption.\nGenerally, the mice would be inactive for a period, and then prior\nto being removed would show some additional periods of activity\nwhen oxygen consumption rose and body temperature was also\nelevated. This pattern was true for all the mice in the study. An\nunexpected pattern, however, was that transient reductions in\nmetabolic rate could be observed in some (but not all) animals (see\n \n\u03c1 = SA\n2\nS2 + SA\n2\n,\nTHE JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY\n281Repeatability of RMR\nFig.\uf0201A,D, mice 14 and 45). It is unclear what causes these\nreductions, but our measurements show that they did not consistently\ncorrespond to changes in general activity or body temperature,\nalthough often a short bout of activity followed the end of a\ndepression. From direct visual observations of the mice during some\nof these declines it is clear that the mice were resting and were not\nblocking the inlet or outlet ventilation tubes of the chamber. The\ndrops were never observed during the periods at the start and end\nof runs when the chambers were empty, and they were recorded\nusing multiple machines.\nThese transient decreases in oxygen consumption generally\nlasted between 1 and 4\uf020min and involved drops of up to 50%\nrelative to the adjacent metabolism. Because our analysis to define\nRMRt automatically selects the period from the entire\nmeasurement with the lowest mean calculated across 10\nconsecutive readings, the estimated RMRt inevitably coincided\nwith the period of a transient drop. This could potentially cause\na problem. Either because animals might consistently show the\ndrops and this would generate a spurious increase in the\nrepeatability, or because they might only occasionally show them,\nin which case repeatability would be diminished. In the light of\nthese data, we therefore analysed the data for short-term\nrepeatability in two ways. First, we used our standard analysis\nprotocol to define the RMRt. This would include the transient drops\nin metabolism when they occurred. Second, we analysed the data\nselecting the 5\uf020min period during which the variation in the\nconsecutive 30\uf020s measurements was lowest. This corresponded to\na period when the metabolism exhibited a stable low rate not\nincluding the transient declines in metabolism.\nThe mean RMRt based on the lowest readings over 5\uf020min (which\ncould include a transient drop) was slightly lower than the mean\nbased on the lowest readings over 5\uf020min at minimum variation\n(which excluded the drops; Table\uf0201). Also, a slightly higher\nrepeatability was found for RMRt including the drops (Table\uf0202). For\nthe long-term repeatability analysis, we used the data excluding\ntransient drops.\nMouse 14 A\nM\net\na\nbo\nlic\n ra\nte\n (k\nJ d\nay\n\u2013\n1 ) \na\nn\nd \na\nct\niv\nity\n (c\nou\nn\nts\n \npe\nr 3\n0 \ns) \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\nMouse 22 B\n35\n36\n37\n38\nMouse 42 C    \nTime in the chamber (h)\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140 Mouse 45 D\n0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.50 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5\nBo\ndy\n te\nm\npe\nra\ntu\nre\n (\u00b0\nC)\n35\n36\n37\n38\nFig.\uf0201.

Over the long term (about 110\uf020days),\nRMRt is expressed as the metabolic rate at minimum variation and is shown for females that were not bred (N\uf03d16) and those that were bred (N\uf03d17) between\nmeasurements.\nTHE JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY\n282\nShort-term repeatability\nThe mean coefficient of variation (CV) across individuals between\nthe RMRt measurements was 5.0%. Absolute mean RMRt for the\nfirst trial (22.5\uf020kJ\uf020day\u20131) was not different from the second trial\nmeasured 15\uf020days later (22.5\uf020kJ\uf020day\u20131; Table\uf0201). There was a highly\nsignificant effect of body mass on RMRt for both measurements\n(both traits log converted: F1,237\uf03d96.2, P<0.0001 for the first\nmeasurement and F1,237\uf03d86.1, P<0.0001 for the second; Fig.\uf0202).

We calculated the CV for each pair\nof measurements and then took the mean of these CVs across all\nindividuals. This mean CV was 5.1% and values of Pearson\u2019s\ncorrelation r between the two measurements was significant for\nabsolute RMRt and residual RMRt (Table\uf0203). Repeatability measured\nby intraclass correlation coefficient (\uf072) was significant for both RMR\nand residual RMRt (Table\uf0203, Fig.\uf0205A). Repeatability for body mass\nL. C. Duarte and others\nwas significant when estimated by Pearson\u2019s coefficient (r\uf03d0.55;\nTable\uf0203). However, the large increase in body mass between 70 to\n180\uf020days of age resulted in non-significant value for repeatability\nof body mass measured by \uf072 (Table\uf0203)\nLong-term repeatability in breeding mice\nIn breeding animals, there was a significant relationship between\nlog RMRt and log body mass prior to breeding (R2\uf03d0.84, F1,16\uf03d79.4,\nP<0.0001; Fig.\uf0204B). In the post-lactation period the amount of\nvariation in RMRt explained by variation in body mass was lower\nthan that before breeding, but was still significant (R2\uf03d0.28,\nF1,16\uf03d7.1, P\uf03d0.02; Fig.\uf0204B). Mean CV between the two\nmeasurements was 11.3%.

Our\ndetailed analysis of body temperature and behaviour did, however,\nhighlight a potentially more serious issue: transient reductions in\nmetabolism in some individuals (see Fig.\uf0201A,D; mice 14 and 45).\nThe nature of these decreases in metabolism is not clear, but they\nhave also been observed by others using similar high resolution\nsystems, and consequently they are not unusual to our equipment,\nstudy animals and protocols.

The reason they are probably not more frequently reported\nis that many researchers use multi-channel systems where the\nmeasurement period for each chamber is intermittent and averaged\nover much longer periods (generally 10\u201315\uf020min), compared with\nour high resolution systems where we obtain almost continuous\nmeasurements for each individual at 30\uf020s intervals.\nInability to detect and eliminate these periods of decreased\nmetabolism from analysis could be a serious problem in\nmultichannel systems because it is impossible to establish in such\nsystems whether a low measurement is a truly low metabolic rate\n\u2013 or a measurement during which there was a transient decline in\nmetabolism. Multi-channel systems have several problems, as was\nhighlighted by Labocha et al. (Labocha et al., 2004), together with\nsome ideas of how to reduce these problems, but the problem\nidentified here cannot be resolved by these approaches. On average,\nthe estimated metabolism including these declines was 2% lower\nthan when they were eliminated by taking the least variable 5\uf020min.\nHowever, individual estimates were up to 25% lower. Hence, in a\nlarge population this effect may be relatively trivial. However, in a\nsmaller sample, and when individual variation is an important aspect\nof the study, these transient drops may become much more\nsignificant. We suggest that wherever possible estimates of BMR\nand RMRt should be made using quasi-continuous monitoring\nsystems with high frequency measurements which allow resolution\nof these events, and allow them to be eliminated from the analysis.\nUsing the absolute lowest values for RMRt in the analysis of\nrepeatability (including the drops) yielded a slightly greater estimate\nof repeatability than using the RMRt measured at lowest variation\n(i.e. excluding the transient drops).\nShort-term repeatability of RMRt\nThe RMRt measured here was highly repeatable in non-breeding MF1\nmice over short intervals. These results agree with estimates of\nrepeatability between 0.6 and 0.7 for RMR that have been observed\nin various other mammalian species: wild-caught Dipodomys\nmerriami (Hayes et al., 1998), bank voles, Myodes (Clethrionomys)\nglareolus (Labocha et al., 2004), free-living populations of North\nAmerican red squirrels, Tamiasciurus hudsonicus (Larivee et al.,\n2010), and in a wild population of weasels, Mustela nivalis, during\nthe summer (Szafranska et al., 2007). High (0.6\u20130.7) short-term\nrepeatability in RMRt has also been shown in several species of birds,\nsuch as laboratory housed zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata (V\u00e9zina\nand Williams, 2005), and in European stonechats, Saxicola torquata\nrubicola (Versteegh et al., 2008). Much lower repeatability has been\nobserved in other studies. For instance, in a wild population of bank\nvoles a \uf072 of 0.34 was found (Boratynski and Koteja, 2008). Moreover,\nno significant repeatability was observed in deer mice, Peromyscus\nmaniculatus sonorensis (Russell and Chappell, 2007), and in leaf-\neared mice (Bozinovic, 2007). The reasons behind the large differences\nin repeatability between studies are unclear. Perhaps it is caused by\nsubtle differences in protocols between laboratories that are known\nto affect the RMR estimates (Hayes et al., 1992b). Alternatively it\nL. C. Duarte and others\nmay reflect differences in the selection history of different species.\nWhatever the cause, a comparison of these various studies suggests\nthat RMRt and BMR cannot be assumed to be repeatable without\nverification when studying new species.\nLong-term repeatability of RMRt\nIn our results, repeatability values of residual RMRt over a short\ninterval (averaging 15\uf020days) measured by both Pearson\u2019s correlation\nand intraclass correlation, was very similar to the repeatability by\nthe same measures over a long interval (about 110\uf020days) in non-\nbreeding females (Tables\uf0202 and 3). Other studies of repeatability of\nRMRt comparing long with short intervals in both birds and\nmammals have generated contrasting results about the effect of time\n(between measurements) on repeatability.\nGreenfinches (Carduelis chloris) captured in the field and kept\nin captivity showed high repeatability of mass-specific RMR over\nthe short term (4\uf020days: r\uf03d0.89; 8\uf020days: r\uf03d0.84) and lower, but\nsignificant, repeatability over the long term [130\uf020days: r\uf03d0.65\n(H\u00f5rak et al., 2002)], which to some extent reflects the repeatability\nin body mass. A study on kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) showed a\nsignificant relationship between residual RMR during the incubation\nand the chick-rearing periods [r\uf03d0.64 (Bech et al., 1999)]. They\nalso found significant repeatability of BMR by intraclass correlation\n(\uf072\uf03d0.52) for comparisons during incubation, chick-rearing and pre-\nbreeding periods, from different years. High repeatability for BMR\nusing intraclass correlation was found in male and non-reproductive\nfemale zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, but declined considerably\nin males from values of 0.63 (over an 8-day interval) to 0.29 [over\nintervals of 127\u2013249\uf020days (V\u00e9zina and Williams, 2005)]. Although\nthese results suggest an effect of time on repeatability of RMR,\ncontradictory results have been found, even for the same species\nand between sexes. In reproductive female zebra finches, V\u00e9zina\nand Williams (V\u00e9zina and Williams, 2005) also found high\nrepeatability of RMR for egg-laying and chick-rearing stages, with\nno time effect over a period of 8\u201310\uf020months. Another study on zebra\nfinches showed very little change in repeatability of residual RMR\nin males using measurements separated by 1.5\uf020months and 2.5\uf020years:\nfrom r\uf03d0.46 to r\uf03d0.52, but in females there was a higher change in\nrepeatability from r\uf03d0.41 to r\uf03d0.52 (Rfnning et al., 2005). This\nconflicting result for the same species was attributed to the\ndifferences in the time interval used to measure repeatability in both\nstudies as well as to the number of measurements they averaged to\ncalculate each repeated measurement (V\u00e9zina and Williams, 2005).\nThis difference in a single species reveals the difficulty in finding\na pattern to describe the effect of time on repeatability, if the time\nintervals being compared are not the same.\nIn mammals, studies comparing the effect of time on repeatability\nare sometimes restricted to one sex and\/or to a single reproductive\nstate. For example, in a free-ranging population of male weasels,\nrepeatability of RMR corrected for body mass was high in summer\n(\uf072\uf03d0.55, r\uf03d0.54; N\uf03d22) and in summer and winter combined, when\ncorrected for the effect of season (\uf072\uf03d0.63, r\uf03d0.62), suggesting that\nTable\uf0204.

However,\nover the long term (192-days interval) repeatability was significant\n(r\uf03d0.72) only for non-reproductive females (Lariv\u00e9e et al., 2010).\nIn a wild population of bank voles, repeatability of mass-independent\nBMR over long intervals (\uf072\uf03d0.23; 54\uf020days) declined 32% in\ncomparison with repeatability over short intervals (\uf072\uf03d0.34; 5\uf020days);\nrepeatability of absolute BMR showed a 47% decline over long\nintervals (Boratynski and Koteja, 2008). Our results show that\nresidual RMR in non-breeding females over long intervals decreased\nonly marginally, by 1\u20132%, in comparison to short intervals.\nTogether, these data reveal no clear patterns. The extent to which\nthe time interval between measurements affects repeatability\ndepends on the length of the interval between repeated\nmeasurements, on the method used to measure repeatability, and\non the species involved.\nRepeatability of body mass\nRepeatability of body mass has been shown in several species of\nsmall mammals either by Pearson or intraclass correlation in wild\npopulations (Szafranska et al., 2007; Boratynski and Koteja, 2008)\n(Larivee et al., unpublished data) and in captivity (Labocha et al.,\n2004). The negative values for repeatability of body mass over the\nlong term in the present study, measured by the intraclass correlation\n\uf072, resulted from the way \uf072 is calculated (see Materials and Methods).\nIn theory, \uf072 should vary from a negative value (somewhere between\nminus one and zero), indicating that all variation is within\nindividuals, to plus one, where all the variation is among individuals\n(i.e. every time an individual is measured the same value is\nobtained). The variance component among groups is calculated by\nthe difference between the mean square among and within groups\n(Sokal and Rohlf, 1981; Lessells and Boag, 1987). When the mean\nsquare within groups is higher than that among groups, the\ndenominator of the equation, and hence the resultant value of \uf072, is\nnegative (Lessells and Boag, 1987). This means that \uf072 is sensitive\nto changes in the means of the traits in question as well as their\nvariances. If the population mean of the first measurement differs\nfrom the population mean of the second measurement, this difference\nwill result in an increased within-individual variance, yielding a\ndecreased \uf072 (Hayes and Jenkins, 1997; Hayes et al., 1998). The fact\nthat repeatability of whole RMRt and body mass estimated by \uf072\nwas non-significant over the long term was caused by the increase\nin body mass over this interval in our mice. Pearson\u2019s product-\nmoment correlation coefficient, r, on the other hand, assesses the\nconsistency of a trait relative to the population mean, and therefore\ngives a more realistic estimate of repeatability when the population\nmean changes. The high repeatability of body mass over the long\nterm (measured by Pearson\u2019s r correlation) only for the non-breeding\ngroup (Table\uf0203) suggests a change of body composition after\nreproduction, despite the fact that mean body mass increased in both\nbreeding and non-breeding groups (Table\uf0201).\nAssociation of non-reproductive RMRt with reproductive\nparameters\nThe non-significant association between both litter size and litter\nmass with RMRt measured in the pre-breeding and post-lactation\nperiods was consistent with our previous results in the same strain\nof mice, which was based on measurements of RMRt before\nreproduction (Johnson et al., 2001) or at peak lactation (Speakman\nand Kr\u00f3l, 2003). Similar results were found for measurements in\ndifferent strains of laboratory mice (Hayes et al., 1992a; Johnston\net al., 2007), and in other species (Derting and McClure, 1989;\nStephenson and Racey, 1993a; Stephenson and Racey, 1993b). In\ncombination with the high repeatability of RMRt over short and\nlong intervals in virgin females, these data indicate that the lack of\nassociation between RMRt and reproductive performance in mice\n(Johnson et al., 2001; Johnston et al., 2007) (our results) is not caused\nby poor repeatability of RMRt. The widespread idea that\nrepeatability sets an upper limit to heritability (Falconer and\nMackey, 1996) has been contested, and estimating repeatability may\nbe problematic for highly plastic or strongly context-dependent traits\n(Dohm, 2002). Here we showed high repeatability of RMRt for non-\nreproductive mice, however, the fact that RMRt is not repeatable\nafter a reproductive event suggests plasticity of RMRt, which may\nor may not be reversible.\nWhen these changes in phenotype are reversible, it is named\nflexibility, which is a category of plasticity (Piersma and Drent,\n2003). Flexibility of RMRt is a widespread phenomenon in birds\nthat involves reversible changes in response to environmental\nfactors such as temperature and seasonality (review in McKechine,\n2008), as well as adjustments to the events during the animal\u2019s life,\nsuch as reproduction. In zebra finches, RMRt is highly repeatable\nfor females in a given breeding season (between laying eggs and\nchick-hearing) and in non-breeding state (V\u00e9zina and Williams,\n2005), and when RMRt before and after a breeding event are\ncompared (R\u00f8nning et al., 2005).\nPlasticity of RMRt has been observed in different species of\nmammals exposed to different conditions, such as cold acclimation\n(e.g. Hart, 1957; Russell and Chappell, 2007; McDevitt and\nSpeakman, 1995), caloric restriction (e.g. Ferguson et al., 2007;\nMartin et al., 2007; Hambly et al., 2005; Selman et al., 2005) and\nreproduction, with a significant increase of RMRt during lactation\n(e.g. Johnson et al., 2001b; Naya, 2008). However, we are not aware\nof any study showing flexibility of RMRt (i.e. where RMRt returns\nto the previous level), since no measurements of RMRt were taken\nagain when animals were returned to the original conditions. Rather,\nthe very few examples of studies on repeatability over long intervals\non wild population of mammals, especially where reproduction must\nbe involved, pointed in the opposite direction; suggesting no\nrepeatability of RMR after reproduction. For example, the fact that\nSzafranzka et al. (Szafranzka et al., 2007) only found repeatability\nafter controlling for the seasonal effect and that Lariv\u00e9e et al.\n(Lariv\u00e9e et al., 2010) did find repeatability over long intervals, but\nonly for non-reproductive females in American red squirrels, may\nbe due to a lack of flexibility of RMR after a reproductive event.\nThe increase in RMRt we found here in post-lactating mice may\nbe attributed in part to the incomplete reversal of the hypertrophy\nin the alimentary tract and associated organs such as the liver, heart\nand mammary glands, which is known to occur during lactation\n(Konarzewski and Diamond, 1995; Speakman and McQueenie,\n1996; but see Johnson et al., 2001a). During the post-lactation period,\nadipose tissue replaces all glandular structures in the mammary gland\nin a process called involution, which occurs during the first 2 to\n3\uf020days after weaning. Mice return to oestrus cycling within 4 to 5\uf020days\nof the end of lactation (Monks et al., 2008). Although the process\nof involution of the mammary glands is completed soon after\nweaning, the organs associated with increase in energy expenditure\nduring lactation, such as the liver and heart, do not reach the normal\nvalues of virgin females of the same age, even 42\uf020days after weaning\n(Bergman et al., 1994). This might explain the higher values of\nRMRt we found in the post-lactation period (about 14\uf020days after\nTHE JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY\n286 L. C. Duarte and others\nweaning) compared with the pre-breeding period. The fact that a\nreproductive event prevents repeatability suggests plasticity of\nRMRt and may explain the absence of association between RMRt\nand reproductive output.\nIn conclusion, our results show high repeatability of RMRt and\nof residual RMRt in non-breeding mice over both short and long\nintervals, measured by both Pearson\u2019s correlation, r, and intraclass\ncorrelation, \uf072. However, repeatability was lost when mice bred\nbetween measurements, and we found no relationship between\nreproductive output and RMRt. Lack of repeatability is thus not\nresponsible for the absence of correlation between RMRt and\nreproductive output. The fact that this trait is not repeatable after a\nreproductive event is consistent with the idea of plasticity of RMRt\nin response to lactation demands.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis work was funded by BBSRC grant BB\/C516228\/1 to J.R.S.
