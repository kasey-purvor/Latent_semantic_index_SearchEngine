Direct sampling by trenching or trial pits is relatively\ncheap and gives a geologist or engineer a direct view of the\ntarget. Boreholes are a natural extension from trial pits since,\nalthough they sample in depth at only one point, they may\nrecover physical samples of the material from the units under\ninvestigation. Geophysics is frequently regarded as useful in\nterms of being noninvasive, but lacking in resolution, and inca-\npable of coping with complex near-surface materials. This\npresents a strange contradiction, since geophysical surveys are\naccepted as a good tool for archaeological surveys, where the\nmain purpose is to identify inhomogeneity in the near sur-\nface with high resolution. Archaeogeophysical surveys are\nhighly detailed, but slow and expensive. Running surveys of\nthe same area with multiple geophysical methods is even\nmore expensive, though this offers the prospect of improved\ncharacterization of subsurface materials.\nThe multisensor platform (MSP) system provides a rapid\nand cost-effective solution to the above problems by exploit-\ning recent developments in geophysical sensors, navigation,\nand communications. The logic behind the MSP is very sim-\nple\u2014record densely-sampled data as rapidly as possible.\nResolution in geophysical data depends on adequate sampling.\nFor surface surveys, spatial sampling is a critical factor. Closely\nspaced samples allow investigation of signal at a wide range\nof wavelengths, and objective assessment of the separation of\nnoise and signal. While geophysicists may (or may not) have\na clear appreciation of the importance of spatial sampling in\ndetermining the minimum wavelength of features they can\ndefine with their data, geologists often do not.\nExploration or site investigation with a grid of widely\nspaced boreholes is rarely supported by a geostatistical analy-\nsis of the validity of interpolating between the boreholes. An\neasy solution to the sampling problem is to oversample. Many\ngeophysical instruments now produce output at constant time\nintervals, typically between 1 and 10 Hz. Thus, if they are\nmoved steadily over the ground, they can measure densely\nsampled profiles. The consequent requirements are to estab-\nlish the position of the instrument with sufficient accuracy at\nthe time of each reading, and to be able to store the data pro-\nduced, perform quality checks in real time, and pass the data\nrapidly onwards in a convenient format for processing and\ndisplay. If multiple measurements with different sensor types\ncan be made simultaneously, the efficiency of the system\nimproves. A further time advantage is gained if the system is\ncompletely self-locating and needs no prior surveying of ref-\nerence grids. Yet another advantage of a self-locating system,\ncoupled with real-time quality control, is that areas of poor or\nunusual data can be resurveyed, or the survey plan modified\nin response to the incoming data.\nThe MSP system. MSP (Figure 1) allows a field crew of two\npeople to operate autonomously and produce geophysical data\nin one day, which would take a crew of 4-5 several days to\ncollect using conventional methods. Any instrument can be\naccommodated provided only that it produces a serial output\ndata string, and that it does not mutually interfere with other\ninstruments on the platform. The target time from end of data\n684 THE LEADING EDGE JULY 2004\nHigh-resolution multisensor geophysical surveys for near-surface\napplications can be rapid and cost-effective\nIAN HILL and TIM GROSSEY, University of Leicester, U.K.\nCHRIS LEECH, Geomatrix, Luton, U.K.\nFigure 1. The Leicester MSP system comprising towing tractor (right),\nMSP sledge (center), in this case with six Cs vapor magnetometers, and\nthe hired van (left) which transports all the equipment and acts as office\nand workshop on site.\nFigure 2. Scale drawing of the MSP with the usual location of geophysi-\ncal sensors annotated.\nacquisition to production of first draft survey data plots is 30\nminutes.\nThe main component of the system is the MSP itself (Figure\n2). This is a lightweight sledge with mounting brackets for a\nwide range of geophysical sensors. The sledge, made from a\nvariety of plastic components and plywood, is geophysically\nundetectable. Essential permanent components of the sledge\nare a DGPS antenna and a three-component fluxgate compass.\nBoth produce digital output as serial data strings that allow\nthe determination of the position of each individual geo-\nphysical sensor on the platform. The serial data from these\ntwo navigation systems, and from up to six geophysical sen-\nsors, is multiplexed together into an Ethernet signal and broad-\ncast by wireless LAN (WLAN) technology to a recording\nstation where the data are viewed in real time and logged on\na laptop computer.\nThe towing vehicle is a small tractor, chosen because it pro-\nvides the necessary motive power with the minimum geo-\nphysical signature. When towing the MSP with an 8-m cable,\nit is invisible to EM systems, and produces a magnetic head-\ning error of less than 1 nT. The tractor is necessary since in\nroutine surveying the system can survey at 7 line-km\/hour.\nUsing instruments with a sampling cycle of 0.1 Hz (such as\nthe EM38, EM31 or Cs vapor magnetometers), this gives a sam-\nple interval of about 0.15 m along the track. The tractor car-\nries an LCD display for the driver that plots the survey track\nplot so that line positioning can be checked and modified as\nnecessary when physical obstructions such as trees and field\nboundaries are encountered. The tractor also supplies power\nto the sledge at 12 and 24 volts DC. With multiple geophysi-\ncal instruments operating continuously, changing separate\nbattery packs in each instrument would be highly inefficient.\nDGPS navigation was chosen since it is simple to operate,\nreadily available, cheap, and sufficiently accurate for most\napplications. In principle any other navigation system could\nbe used if more appropriate\u2014both RTK GPS and tracking total\nstation EDM are viable alternatives, as long as they can out-\nput a continuous serial data string which can be merged with\ndata from the MSP itself.\nData capture and telemetry. The telemetry system on the\nMSP can accept up to eight separate serial data channels, nor-\nmally running at 9600 baud, though lower speeds are accept-\nable. Two channels are taken by the DGPS signal and the\ncompass, leaving six channels for geophysical sensors. The ser-\nial signals are multiplexed together and broadcast by 802.11b\nWLAN. The bandwidth of this wireless system is sufficiently\nlarge so that there is no constraint on the length of serial data\nstrings produced on the MSP or their frequency. In fact, the\nwireless communication seems to maintain signal lock better\nat extreme ranges when there are larger vol-\numes of data being transferred.\nThe maximum range for the WLAN link\nhas not yet been determined. Provided line\nof sight exists, the range is at least 1 km. Tests\nat greater ranges have not been carried out\nsince they are largely irrelevant. With a range\nof 1 km, the MSP could survey over 3 km2\nwithout the base station moving, and this is\nmore area than can realistically be surveyed\nin one day. In any case, the base station may\nbe repositioned with relative ease. For the\nefficient function of the system, the tractor dri-\nver and the observer at the base station stay\nin speech radio contact. The range of this\nradio system is also irrelevant, and is untested\nbeyond 1 km.\nWhen making magnetic surveys, a magnetometer base sta-\ntion is routinely established some distance from the MSP base\nstation. The magnetometer signal is broadcast over a separate\nserial VHF radio link to the MSP base station where it is\nlogged with the other sensor data.\nThe data logging base station consists of a WLAN base\nstation linked to a laptop computer. Geometrics\u2019 Maglog soft-\nware is used to display the incoming data and write the ser-\nial data strings to text files. With a fairly full instrument load,\nthe MSP records megabytes of data per hour. Efficient han-\ndling of these data through postprocessing is essential to the\npracticality of the system. Separate data files for each instru-\nment are merged with the position information in a single data-\nbase file in CSV format. This can then be directly imported\ninto a commercial processing package or be subject to further\npreprocessing. While it is convenient to run the MSP base sta-\ntion inside a vehicle, on sites with particular access problems,\nall base station equipment can be placed in a wheelbarrow\nand moved manually as necessary. It is possible to run the\nsystem with two laptops at the base station linked by an\nEthernet hub. In this case the observer can process data on\nthe second while monitoring the current survey on the first.\nSurvey methods. It is conventional to collect geophysical data\nalong regular straight lines of a presurveyed grid. There is a\nconsiderable body of logic behind this in terms of uniformity\nof sampling, and subsequent processing of the data. The MSP\nconcept was, however, born from the need to cope with sur-\nveying in small, complex agricultural field systems, where any\nattempt to maintain a regularly spaced rectangular grid would\nbe either very time consuming or impossible. The positional\nautonomy of the MSP system is one of its great advantages.\nNo presurvey is required. The MSP can move around obsta-\ncles, collecting data where possible and adapting the survey\ntrack plan to the natural barriers present.\nA survey plan gradually evolved from field experience.\nThe major influence on this is that the MSP has degraded data\nquality when turning corners. Here, the tractor position is inde-\nterminate relative to the MSP, and on tight corners will\napproach the MSP. This leads to increased error levels in data\nfrom EM or magnetic sensors. To minimize this, 180\u00b0 turns\nare avoided where possible. The usual track plan is thus to\nstart by making circuits round the outside of a survey area\nspiraling in towards the center at the required track spacing.\nWhen such outer tracks have covered sufficient ground all\naround the periphery of the area for the MSP to turn and re-\nalign itself, the remainder of the area is infilled with a grid of\nparallel lines, ending with perpendicular tie-lines. Such track\nplans have been used in both the case studies reported here.\nThe advantage of the above system is speed and efficiency.\nJULY 2004 THE LEADING EDGE 685\nFigure 3. (a) MSP equipped with EM34 system with a 20 m separation. The second coil is\ncarried on a separate towed sledge located by its own DGPS system. (b) MSP in the Tearsall\nsurvey equipped with two cesium magnetometers, EM31, EM38, and gamma-ray spectrom-\neter.\na b\nAll accessible area is covered by data tracks efficiently. The\ndisadvantage is that established software for analyzing data\nerrors such as magnetic heading error relies on regular grid\npatterns of data. There is a need here for a more detailed\nanalysis of the essential qualities required of a field track plan\nsuch that the competing demands of logistical convenience,\nand data processing integrity, can be reconciled.\nThe physical structure of the MSP easily accommodates a\nlarge range of geophysical sensors (Figure 3). The essential lim-\niting factor to what may be accommodated simultaneously is\nthe issue of mutual interference between sensors. Most obvi-\nously, high-accuracy magnetic sensors will be degraded if vir-\ntually any other system is added to the MSP.\nEven the MSP\u2019s own electronics may cause a small effect.\nTo minimize this, the magnetic sensors are always mounted\nto the rear of the MSP, away from the electronics modules.\nInterestingly, the control electronics for the magnetometers\ncauses as much magnetic interference as does the MSP itself.\nBoth effects are down at the 1 nT range.\nDeciding which sensors to use in combination is a com-\npromise between ultimate data quality and time in the field.\nIf a heading error of a few nT is acceptable on magnetic data,\nthen the MSP can be used with multiple magnetometers,\nEM31, EM38, and gamma-ray spectrometer simultaneously.\nThe situation is analogous to that of borehole logging, where\nfor any specific application it is possible to devise packages\nof instruments that can run together to optimize field efficiency\nwithout unacceptable compromises on data quality. While\nthere can be general guidelines, the detailed solution will be\nspecific to the requirements for any individual site.\nMineral exploration case history. The MSP system was first\ndeveloped for mineral exploration surveys in the U.K.\u2019s South\nPennine ore field. Athick Carboniferous limestone succession\ncontains interbedded basic lavas. The lavas have been heav-\nily altered and are clay-rich, making them electrically con-\nductive as well as magnetic relative to the limestones.\nThe location of the lavas is critical with respect to miner-\nalization. An example test site surveyed is at Tearsall, near\nMatlock, Derbyshire. Figure 4 shows a geologic map of the\narea with field boundaries and topographic features super-\nimposed. The limestones and lavas dip to the north at about\n17\u00b0 below a hillside also sloping down to the north at a lower\nangle, about 12\u00b0. The area is agricultural land with little geo-\nlogic exposure. A quarry at the extreme eastern edge of the\nmap provides access to detailed control for the geologic struc-\nture of the site.\nThe total area of about 20 hectares is divided into many\nsmall fields, with trees, bushes, spoil dumps, and capped\nmineshafts from historical mineral workings at the site. For\nlogistical reasons, the survey was conducted in a number of\nseparate work periods spread over a week, but the total time\nspent in the fieldwork was less than two days for a crew of\ntwo people. The gray lines on Figure 4 show the track lines\nof the MSP system over the area. The track lines in some areas\nappear random, and were dictated by access around obstruc-\ntions such as those listed above. The combination of tractor,\nflexible towline, and sledge makes the system maneuverable\nand agile, which is important in coping with rough ground,\nsteep slopes, and confined areas.\nMagnetic data were collected using two cesium vapor\nsensors separated perpendicularly to the MSP track by 2 m\n(Figure 3b). Data from each sensor were corrected for drift,\nusing a remote base station, and for heading error before the\ndata were merged to produce the plot in Figure 5. The mag-\nnetic data highlight the location of the two lava beds in the\nnorth and south of the area. It is clear that the inferred out-\ncrop pattern of the lava on the geologic map is not correct in\ndetail. The high positive amplitudes of the magnetic field\nshow that the northern (upper lava) outcrop is displaced by\na fault, and the southern (lower lava) is much thinner than\nmapped.\nDuring this survey, the MSP system also carried EM31 and\nEM38 sensors. The data from the EM38 are plotted in Figure\n6. In this plot, the conductivity data output by the EM38 have\nbeen converted to resistivity values to simplify a later com-\nparison with resistivity imaging data. The most noticeable fea-\nture is the contrast between the resistivity over the lava units\nin the north and south of the area with that of the interstrat-\nified limestones. The lavas show a much lower resistivity than\nthe limestone in the center of the image. The resistivities for\nthe limestone may appear low, but due to the limited depth\nof penetration of the EM38, the value returned is that of weath-\nered rock. The lava units give a low resistivity due to their\nextensive alteration. The resistivity plot shows the same off-\nset of the northern lava outcrop, and the relatively narrow\nsouthern lava outcrop as was inferred from the magnetic data.\nA more subtle feature is the trough of low-resistivity val-\nues running approximately east-west, cutting through the\nlimestone sequence in the center of the image. This correlates\nwith a clay way-board outcropping at the surface. The high\nclay content of the altered tuff that constitutes the way-board\nproduces the conductivity contrast with the limestone. The\nreality of this correlation can be tested with independent geo-\nphysical and geologic evidence. Figure 7a shows a photo-\ngraph of the western wall of the quarry on the eastern edge\nof the survey area, taken looking west. The dip of the lime-\nstone beds, as can be clearly seen, is steeper than the surface\ntopography. The resistivity imaging profile (Figure 7b) shows\nthat the thin (~0.2m) clay way-board produces a clear effect\non the imaging profile.\nThis example shows that it is possible to collect usefully\ndetailed geophysical survey data at this scale of survey, cov-\nering some 20 hectares of ground in less than two days. The\nsurvey also recorded EM31 and gamma-ray spectrometer\n686 THE LEADING EDGE JULY 2004\nFigure 4. Geologic map of the Tearsall area, showing limestone country\nrock (blue) with interbedded basic lavas (purple).

(Grid squares 100 m)\ndatasets which are not reported here.\nArchaeogeophysics case history. A good test of the resolu-\ntion attainable with the system would be to perform a sur-\nvey which requires high levels of accuracy, both in spatial\npositioning and geophysical parameters. For this purpose\nthe site of the Roman city of Wroxeter, Shropshire was\nselected. This site has the benefit of having already been sub-\nject to a complete and detailed archaeogeophysical survey\nwith magnetic gradient data maps published. In addition it\nwas also used by English Heritage geophysicists for their\nown independent tests of their cesium magnetometer sur-\nvey system. The primary objective was to determine the\nquality of the data that can be collected with the MSP sys-\ntem. To test this, a small area of the total site was chosen\nand surveyed multiple times with differing configurations\nof instruments. Comparisons between the different data sets\nrecorded with different instrument configurations on dif-\nferent days would test the internal consistency of the data.\nComparison of the differing data with pre-existing surveys\nwould allow determination of the MSP system\u2019s effectiveness.\nThus a small area at the eastern side of the city site was\nselected for repeated survey. Most of this was in a triangular\nfield referred to in previous published surveys as field 4\n(Figure 8).\nThis field was surveyed with three main magnetometer\nconfigurations, and some minor variations on each. For every\nsurvey, a separate cesium vapor magnetometer was set up as\na base station to record diurnal variation of the earth\u2019s mag-\nnetic field. These data were logged, via a serial radio link, on\nthe MSP base logging computer. The magnetometer configu-\nration used for the data shown in Figure 8a comprised six sen-\nsors distributed at 0.5 m intervals along a transverse bar towed\nat constant height (0.4 m) above the ground. The photograph\nin Figure 1 was taken at the start of this particular survey. To\nproduce the plot in Figure 8a, the data from each of the six\nmagnetometers were corrected for diurnal variation and indi-\nvidual sensor heading error. The corrected data values were\nassigned positions determined by adding the offset of the sen-\nsor to the DGPS antenna position. The sensor offset was cal-\nculated using the orientation of the MSP determined from the\nonboard compass, and the known offset distances of the sen-\nsor from the DGPS antenna. Depending on the actual tracks\nof the MSP, the six sensors follow parallel lines defining one\ndata swath, but there may be a data gap of variable width\nbetween adjacent swaths recorded on consecutive tracks.\nSince the MSP and tractor leave almost no physical mark\non pasture fields, it can be difficult for the tractor driver to\nensure that each following track is correctly positioned to the\nnearest 0.5 m. A consequence of this is that unsampled gaps\ncan be left between swaths. All data points were then inter-\npolated to a 0.5 m grid, and presented as a monochrome plot.\nLarge data gaps caused by over-wide track spacing have not\nbeen interpolated, producing white gaps in the data cover-\nage. The data collection took less than two hours.\nThe plot in Figure 8b has been produced from data col-\nlected by English Heritage using their cesium vapor magne-\ntometer system. Their data collection period was completely\nindependent, and occurred about four weeks after that for the\ndata in 8a.\nThese latter data have magnetometer instrumentation\ndirectly comparable with that used on the MSP, but the data\nwere collected along a regular presurveyed grid with a line\nspacing of 0.5 m. Location of their data grid was using RTK\nDGPS surveying. The total survey time taken to produce the\ndata used in this figure was between 1 and 2 days, for a team\nof three people. The data were processed by Neil Linford of\nEnglish Heritage using an in-house software system devel-\noped specifically for archaeogeophysical surveys.\nBoth parts of Figure 8 show a section of the Roman city\nof Wroxeter near the eastern city gate. The main blocks of the\ncity plan, about 100 m across, are clearly visible. Within these\nthe outline of building walls and smaller isolated features can\nbe correlated between the plots. The magnetic anomaly ampli-\ntude range is from +15 to -10 nT. Here, discussion will con-\ncentrate on the quality of the data, rather than the\narchaeological interpretation. The comparison of the two parts\nof Figure 8 is interesting, viewed from different perspectives.\nFirstly, the objective of demonstrating the resolution fairly\neasily attainable with the MSP system has been achieved.\nWhile it is clear that the image of Figure 8a is less sharp than\nthat of 8b, the main features with areal extent of greater than\n1 m are defined on both images. There is an apparent trade-\noff between the higher level of resolution, against reducing\nthe survey time by a factor of 10 or greater.\nJULY 2004 THE LEADING EDGE 687\nFigure 6. EM38 data mapped as resistivity values for the Tearsall area.\nThese data were collected simultaneously with the magnetic data of Figure\n5. (Grid squares 100 m)\nFigure 5. Magnetic map for the Tearsall area formed by combining data\nfrom two sensors in the configuration shown in Figure 3b. (Grid squares\n100 m)\nAt a second level of comparison, it would be interesting\nto identify the detailed causes of the differences between the\ntwo images. There are numerous factors to be considered. The\nnavigation by DGPS used for the MSP is inherently less accu-\nrate than that for the RTK DGPS system used by English\nHeritage to position their survey lines. The survey pattern of\nthe MSP is liable to data gaps where adjacent survey tracks\nare not sufficiently close together. The interpolation of these\nslightly more sparse and less well-located data to a regular\ngrid then inevitably leads to some high-cut filtering of the data.\nThe processing schemes for the data were different. These\nissues are currently under investigation. Further analysis of\nthese data may allow us to develop the MSP system and its\ndata processing so that it can produce data very closely equiv-\nalent to that from best quality archaeological systems. If this\nis so, it will not only provide more-than-adequate survey\nquality for most geologic and environmental applications, but\noffer a new tool to archaeological investigations, making sur-\nveys of large areas not only feasible, but cost-effective.
