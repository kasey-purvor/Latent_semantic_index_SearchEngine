Since the first report on high frequency oscillatory \nsynchrony between V1 neurons belonging to the same orientation column (Gray \nand Singer, 1989, PNAS, 86, 1698-1702), the role of such oscillations in visual \nperception has been extensively researched. Visual stimuli elicit an early, evoked \ngamma-band response and a later, induced (neither time nor phase-locked) \nresponse. An abundance of experimental evidence now links both evoked and \ninduced high frequency oscillations to a range of visual stimulus properties. On \nthe basis of early studies into gamma-band oscillations in vision, induced high \nfrequency oscillatory activity has been proposed as a putative cortical mechanism \nof coherent percept formation and object representation while evoked high \nfrequency activity was related to the processing of image features. Recent studies \ndemonstrate that both evoked and induced gamma-band activity are correlated \nwith the speed and accuracy of visual detection and discrimination. Furthermore, \ninduced gamma-band oscillations in the visual cortex are also correlated with \nfixational eye movement patterns. These direct relations between gamma-band \nactivity and the efficacy of visual perception strongly suggest that cortical high \nfrequency synchronisations constitute a neural mechanism that subserves \nprocesses essential for the organised intake and analysis of visual information.  \n \nKeywords: gamma-band activity, EEG, high frequency oscillations, visual \nperception, object representation, neural coding, electrophysiology\nIntroduction \nDynamics of visual processing \nPerception is fundamentally a cognitive activity, a process of acquiring knowledge about \nenvironmental objects and events for the purpose of appropriate action (Palmer, 1999). In order to \nguide behaviour aptly, perception has to effectively deal with large amounts of highly varied \ninformation. This is particularly true for visual perception. The complexity of the visual environment \nintroduces many challenges: scenes need to be segmented and objects layered in space, a process that \nrequires concurrent bottom-up and top-down contributions (Ullman, 2007). In this context, bottom-up \ncontributions derive from processes that analyse incoming visual information with little recourse to \nstored knowledge, while top-down contributions arise from prior visual knowledge and the task set. \nBottom-up segmentation of natural scenes cannot in itself lead to speedy and efficient processing, since  \ncommonly-present image ambiguities necessitate top-down inputs driven by stored representations of \nfamiliar objects and scenes. However, the exact mechanisms that subserve such representational \nprocesses in the cortex are not yet fully understood. It is known that the entire representational process \noccurs extremely rapidly and involves a wide cortical network. This network includes both posterior \nareas of the ventral visual stream, running from striate cortex to inferotemporal cortex, and  more \nanterior areas that lie within the prefrontal cortex (Bullier, 2001; Rainer and Miller, 2000). Within 150-\n200 milliseconds the visual information is propagated through a series of brain regions with bottom-up \n(posterior) and top-down (prefrontal) influences that lead processing to converge upon an accurate \nrepresentation of the observed object (Bar, 2003). The feedforward processing in the ventral visual \nstream itself takes around 100 ms to reach high-level representational areas in the inferotemporal \ncortex, and this seems to be sufficient for coarse and rapid categorisation of objects (Liu et al., 2009; \nVanRullen and Thorpe, 2001). But early feedback from the prefrontal cortex is also considered crucial, \nsince it provides global shape information that subsequently enables posterior cortical areas to \nconstrain representational processing to only a few likely interpretations of the observed object (Bar, \n2003; Bar et al., 2006). Finally,  neural activation in the posterior cortex persists for another couple of \nhundred milliseconds, lasting around 300 ms in total. This may be attributable to priming-related short-\nterm memory processes (as suggested by Bar, 2003) or long-term memory processes (Subramaniam et \nal., 2000).  \nThe timing of visual object representation is rapid and starts to involve higher-level areas after \napprox. 100 ms (Bullier, 2001). Such timing closely coincides with cortical high frequency oscillatory \nresponses, also known as gamma-band activity (GBA; >30 Hz). GBA arises in neurons of the visual \ncortex after approx. 100 ms and has repeatedly been proposed to play an important role in subserving \nobject representation. This review will focus on the accumulated evidence that associates gamma-band \noscillations to visual processing. We will argue that the earlier, evoked GBA reflects an initial stage of \nconcurrent bottom-up and top-down processing in vision, while the later, induced GBA is a neural \nmarker of more downstream representational processing which ensures efficient and timely information \nintake and integration. \nGamma-band activity as a mechanism for the integration of visual information \nInformation processing in the brain during perception relies on multiple coding strategies. The \nstrategies employed by a particular neural process will be dependent on the tuning properties of \ndifferent neurons that subserve it as well as the coding density of neural assemblies to which they \nbelong (Spratling, 2004). A network that is responsible for the perception of objects relies on groups of \nneurons tuned to different visual properties such as orientation, colour, texture, depth, motion or shape. \nThese neurons are widely distributed, being located in different columns within a single area \n(orientation columns or colour blobs in V1) or in different areas of the extrastriate cortex altogether \n(shape in the lateral occipital cortex, motion in middle temporal area, colour in V4\/V8). Von der \nMalsburg (1990) proposed that temporally synchronous firing would allow coordinated coding of \ndifferent features belonging to the same object within and between these non-contiguous network \nelements. Synchronised neuronal activity in the gamma-band range was indeed found to relate to the \nproperties of visual stimuli in a series of studies on anesthetised cats, showing enhancements for stimuli \nthat allowed for coherent percepts (Gray and Singer, 1989; for a review see Singer and Gray, 1995). In \nthese studies, synchronised gamma-band activity was elicited by the stimulus but was neither  strictly \nphase- or time-locked to its onset, thus earning the label \u2019induced\u2019 as opposed to \u2019evoked\u2019. Induced \ngamma-band oscillations were found to be well-suited to support visual perception, being fast enough \nto allow neurons to dynamically fall in and out of neural assemblies responsible for integrating the \nrepresentations of various aspects of everyday scenes (Singer, 1993).  \nFor these same reasons, induced temporal synchrony in the gamma-band is proposed to be the most \nlikely candidate to support a series of other cognitive functions that require rapid and flexible \nintegrative processing in vision, such as awareness, attention and memory. The role of induced GBA in \nvisual cognition has been recently reviewed in great detail by Tallon-Baudry (2009; also see earlier \nreviews by Kaiser and Lutzenberger, 2003; Keil et al., 2001; M\u00fcller et al., 2000; Tallon-Baudry and \nBetrand, 1999). Evoked GBA, which is both phase and time-locked to stimulus onset, was previously \nconsidered to reflect bottom-up processing of image features. However, more recent findings have led \nto a somewhat altered view on evoked GBA, and it is now perceived as a marker of visual processing \nthat reflects both bottom-up and top-down influences. In this review, the focus is on reports of evoked \nand induced gamma-band modulations that directly relate to detection, discrimination and classification \nperformance in vision and thus demonstrate that oscillatory synchrony is a neural correlate of visual \nperception. \n \n \nEvoked GBA  \nEvoked GBA as a correlate of bottom-up stimulus processing \nIn the electroencephalogram (EEG), evoked GBA is among the first responses that follow visual \nstimulation. Several early studies of brain signals evoked by simple visual stimuli (light flashes, \ngratings or reversing checkerboards) reported multi-cycled high-frequency oscillations, superimposed \non the broad-band visual evoked potential (VEP; Cracco and Cracco, 1978; Sannita et al., 1995; \nWhittaker and Siegfried, 1983). These so-called \"wavelets\" \u2013 not to be confused with the wavelet-\nmethod for spectral analysis \u2013 were extracted by high-pass filtering the broad-band signal in the \ngamma-band range. By contrast, contemporary studies usually extract GBA by applying a time-\nfrequency transform to the event-related potential (ERP) or by computing a measure of phase-locking, \nsuch as the phase-locking factor (Tallon-Baudry et al., 1997a). In most studies, evoked GBA peaks at \napproximately 80-120 ms following stimulus onset. A key characteristic of evoked GBA is strong \ninter-trial coherence or phase-locking in the frequency range between approximately 30\u201350 Hz. Its \nscalp distribution in the EEG is centred over the occipital cortex. Early studies largely excluded a \ncontribution of the electro-retinogram or sub-cortical sources (Lopez and Sannita, 1997; Sannita et al., \n1995; Whittaker and Siegfried, 1983). More recent studies with sufficient spatial resolution have \nidentified occipital and occipital-temporal areas as sources of evoked GBA (Gruber et al., 2006; Narici \net al., 2003), which matches results of intracranial recordings in humans (Lachaux et al., 2000) and \nmonkeys (Fries et al., 2001; Rols et al., 2001). \nEarly latency of evoked GBA points to an involvement in sensory stages of visual information \nprocessing. Accordingly, several studies have demonstrated that the amplitude of evoked GBA is \ndetermined by the properties of the stimulus, including its luminance (Rols et al., 2001), contrast \n(Sannita et al., 1995; Schadow et al., 2007), size (Busch et al., 2004; Narici et al., 2003), spatial \nfrequency (Bodis-Wollner et al., 2001; Fr\u00fcnd et al., 2007a; Sannita et al., 1995; Tzelepi et al., 2000), or \nlocation in the visual field (Busch et al., 2004; Lopez and Sannita, 1997; Narici et al., 2003). These \nfindings from human scalp-recorded GBA are in agreement with animal studies using multi-unit \nactivity and local field potentials, which revealed that gamma synchronization is highly dependent on \nstimulus features such as orientation and direction of movement (Friedman-Hill et al., 2000; Frien et \nal., 2000; Siegel and Konig, 2003). Together, this suggests that evoked GBA could reflect the \nactivation of feature selective channels in retinotopically organized cortical visual areas which are \ndirectly involved in the bottom-up neural representation of a stimulus, similarly to the earliest \ncomponents of VEPs (cf. Tobimatsu and Celesia, 2006; White, 1995). But unlike the earliest VEP \ncomponents, evoked GBA is also susceptible to numerous top-down influences. In this review, we will \nargue that bottom-up stimulus effects and top-down influences are not simply two concurrent effects on \nthe same signal. Rather, we argue that evoked GBA reflects an early processing level where bottom-up \nstimulus representations interact directly with top-down influences. \nEvoked GBA reflects interactions between stimulus representation and task set \nMost reported top-down effects on evoked GBA can be described as effects of task set. Task set \nrefers to a configuration of perceptual, attentional, mnemonic, and motor processes necessary to \nperform a task (\u201csearch for the letter X\u201d, \u201cpress button A for targets\u201d, or \u201crespond as fast as possible\u201d). \nA critical aspect of task sets, such as the preparation for a difficult task or a specific target stimulus, is \nthat they are formed before the critical stimulus is presented and that they are actively maintained \nthroughout the experiment (cf. Sakai, 2008). Such preparatory effects have been demonstrated by \nstudies of anticipation and task difficulty. These studies revealed that amplitudes of evoked GBA are \nlarger for anticipated stimuli (Fr\u00fcnd et al., 2008b), for speeded compared to slow manual responses \n(Fr\u00fcnd et al., 2007b) and for difficult compared to easy discrimination tasks (Senkowski and \nHerrmann, 2002). Evoked GBA was also found to correlate with speed and accuracy of discrimination \nof a circular arrangement of Gabors embedded in an otherwise random Gabor array; its latency \ncorrelated with reaction times while its amplitude correlated with accuracy (Schadow et al., 2009). \nFurthermore, effects of task set have been found in target detection experiments, where the task set \nimplies the storage of a specific target template and subsequent matching of stimuli with this template. \nSeveral studies have found that GBA evoked by targets (simple geometric shapes) is larger than GBA \nevoked by standards (Busch et al., 2006b; Herrmann and Mecklinger, 2000; Kim et al., 2008). \nAccording to Engel et al. (2001), attention that is directed towards specific features can synchronize \nsubthreshold oscillations of feature-selective assemblies prior to stimulus presentation. This idea rests \non the observation by Fries et al. (2001) that ongoing local field potential fluctuations in the gamma-\nband in cat visual cortex are highly coherent for cells with similar feature preferences but incoherent \nfor cells with different feature preferences. As a consequence of this, other neuronal populations that do \nnot code for the expected feature would not be prepared by means of synchronized subthreshold \noscillations and upon stimulus presentation would produce lower evoked responses than the \nsubthreshold-synchronised populations. A critical component of this model is that effects of task set are \nnot enacted via separate, mediating \u201cattention assemblies\u201d but through an attentional modulation of the \nsame neural assemblies that represent the stimulus. Support for this model is provided by Busch et al. \n(2006b), who found that the magnitude of the target effect on evoked GBA was proportional to the area \noccupied by the critical target feature and thus to the size of the neural assembly representing the target. \nThis was in contrast to target effects on ERPs, which were independent of the size of the neural \nassembly representing the stimulus. Together, the current literature suggests that evoked GBA is a \nneural marker which reflects interactions between bottom-up stimulus representations and top-down \ninfluences due to task set. \nIs evoked GBA a correlate of object representations? \nCurrently, the main controversy in high frequency oscillatory activity research concerns the \ninvolvement of evoked GBA in processes that subserve object classification. The \u201cmatch-and-\nutilization model\u201d by Herrmann et al. (2004b) suggests that evoked GBA is modulated not only when a \nstimulus matches the expectations induced by the task set but whenever a stimulus matches an existing \nmemory trace. It is assumed that this matching effect does not require a specific stimulus template and \nthus occurs even when this match is entirely task-irrelevant or when subjects simply discriminate \nbetween known and unknown stimuli. This assumption is supported by the finding that evoked GBA is \nenhanced for images of nameable, meaningful objects compared to unnameable, nonsense objects \n(Herrmann et al., 2004a; Morup et al., 2006). Furthermore, Fr\u00fcnd et al. (2008a) found that evoked \nGBA differentiated between meaningful and nonsense objects when participants performed speeded \ndiscriminations. There was no effect when responses to the stimuli were delayed. Fr\u00fcnd et al. (2008a) \nconcluded that the early visual processing stages reflected in evoked GBA are affected by object \nclassification only when subjects are pushed to perform rapid stimulus categorization based on coarse \nand global stimulus features.  \nHowever, it should be noted that effects of object classification on evoked GBA have not been \nconsistently found. In fact, the majority of previous studies have failed to find differences in evoked \nGBA elicited by meaningful and nonsense objects (cf. Busch et al., 2006a; Gruber and M\u00fcller, 2005; \nGruber et al., 2006; Martinovic et al., 2009; Tallon-Baudry et al., 1997a). In order to clarify the role of \nevoked GBA in object classification, a recent study by Martinovic et al. (2008b) looked at evoked GBA \nmodulations in a series of experiments that selectively varied the amount of features in object images, \nfor example contrasting black and white line drawings with the same drawings with added greyscale \ntexture or colour. The role of certain image features in the object classification process is reflected by \nresponse times, with features such as colour hastening classification (Rossion and Pourtois, 2004) and \nfeatures such as higher visual complexity slowing it (Ellis and Morrison, 1998). Martinovic et al. \n(2008b) also presented colour-diagnostic objects either in their typical colours or in an altered, atypical \ncolour (e.g. a purple banana) thus maintaining the amount of features constant but slowing the \nclassification process for atypical-colour object images. The aim of the study was to determine whether \nevoked GBA relates to the image feature processing itself or to the role of those features in the \nclassification process. Martinovic et al. (2008b) found that evoked GBA amplitude always increased \nwhen more image features had to be coded, without reflecting the features\u2019 qualitative contribution to \nthe classification process. Similar to the sensory-related ERP component P1, evoked GBA was \nenhanced both for coloured stimuli and for more visually complex line drawings, although they have \nopposite effects on the speed of object classification. Furthermore, evoked GBA and the P1 component \nof the ERP did not differ in amplitude between colour-diagnostic objects presented in typical or \natypical colours, although atypically-coloured objects were associated with response time costs and \nmodulations of later, representation-related components of the ERP. A possible interpretation of these \nnegative findings is that evoked GBA is not a neural marker of cortical object representation, although \nit can be affected by \u201cobjecthood\u201d in paradigms that rely on a coarse categorisation of stimuli, e.g. \ndiscriminating between images of real objects and their scrambled versions. The experiments that \ncontrasted evoked GBA between meaningful and nonsense objects (Busch et al., 2006a; Gruber and \nM\u00fcller, 2005; Herrmann et al., 2004a) relied on different stimulus sets, some coloured, some with line-\ndrawings; they also used various methods to scramble or disassemble the object images and create \nnonsense objects. This may have resulted in differences between the real and nonsense objects in part \nstructure, connectedness and closure, which are factors that influence perceptual grouping and thus \nobjecthood (for more detail on objecthood, see Scholl, 2001). The influence of such perceptual \ngrouping factors on evoked GBA amplitude could explain why object-selectivity effects have not been \nconsistently found.  \nInduced GBA  \nInduced GBA as a correlate of stimulus detection, discrimination and classification \nInduced gamma-band activity in scalp-recorded EEG data usually appears as bursts of high \nfrequency (approximately 30-80 Hz) oscillatory activity in the time range between 200-400 ms (Busch \net al., 2006a; Gruber et al., 2004; Tallon-Baudry et al., 1997a). Induced GBA measured with MEG or \ndepth-EEG is usually longer lasting and extends to higher frequencies (Hoogenboom et al., 2006; \nLachaux et al., 2005; Siegel et al., 2008; Wyart and Tallon-Baudry, 2008). These bursts are not phase-\nlocked to stimulus onset, so averaging epochs of raw data across trials would cancel out the response. \nTo analyze induced GBA, a time-frequency transform has to be applied to the single trials before \naveraging (see Tallon-Baudry and Betrand, 1999). Induced gamma-band oscillations can be observed \nin early visual areas soon after a visual stimulus is presented. In anesthetised monkeys, within-area \ngamma-band synchrony in V1 peaks around 100 ms after a simple flashing stimulus is presented, while \nin V4 this occurs approximately 40 ms later with a decreased response magnitude (Rols et al., 2001). \nLachaux et al. (2005) used depth EEG to investigate large-scale cortical dynamics during the \nperception of upright or inverted Mooney faces in four epileptic patients. In depth EEG, intracerebral \nelectrodes are used to directly record the activity from brain structures potentially involved in the \ngeneration of epileptic activity and Lachaux et al. (2005) selected a group of patients with electrodes \npositioned in various posterior cortical areas. This permitted them to identify the time-course of \ninduced GBA in different areas of the visual cortex. They found that correctly identified faces induced \nincreases in gamma-band activity in a distributed network, with an early burst in the fusiform gyrus and \nthe adjacent lateral occipital cortex (< 200 ms) which was immediately followed by a posterior-anterior \npropagation of activity and a deactivation in the primary visual cortex. It was suggested that between-\narea synchrony emerges even later, around 250 ms, and reflects a coming together of bottom-up and \ntop-down processes in widely distributed areas that leads to successful object classification. Such a \nprocess was thought to be reflected by a transient burst of induced GBA recorded from the scalp with \nEEG, which usually arises between 200 and 400 ms (Tallon-Baudry, 2003; Tallon-Baudry and Betrand, \n1999; although this has recently been challenged by the findings of Yuval-Greenberg et al., 2008). \nEarly studies in the field focused mostly on the relation of induced GBA to various stimulus \nattributes (in particular stimulus coherence), but some recent studies have attempted to demonstrate its \nmore direct involvement in perception by investigating correlations between induced GBA amplitude \nand detection latencies. For instance, Womelsdorf et al. (2006) found correlations between the power \nof induced gamma-band activity pre- and post-stimulus and the speed of detection of attended as \nopposed to unattended visual stimuli in area V4 of awake monkeys. An EEG study by Koch et al. \n(2009) investigated induced GBA whilst participants detected changes in the velocity of concentrically \nmoving gratings whose contrast was parametrically modulated. The Koch et al. (2009) study \ndemonstrated that the amplitude of induced GBA was not only systematically related to task-irrelevant \nstimulus contrast but also predicted the latency of behavioural responses to task-relevant velocity \nchanges. Furthermore, Koch et al. (2009) also observed induced GBA that was sustained through the \nentire stimulation period, similar to MEG findings on induced GBA in motion processing \n(Hoogenboom et al., 2006; Swettenham et al., 2009). One of the earliest studies on gamma-band in the \nhuman EEG during observation of coherently or incoherently moving bars also found sustained \ninduced GBA enhancements for coherent motion (M\u00fcller et al., 1997).  \nAnother major line of research into induced GBA has focused on its role in the formation of a \ncoherent percept and in object representation. A multitude of studies has demonstrated that induced \nGBA amplitude is enhanced for stimuli that constitute a coherent percept (Gruber et al., 2002; Gruber \nand M\u00fcller, 2005; Keil et al., 1999; Rodriguez et al., 1999; Tallon-Baudry et al., 1996, 1997a; Tallon-\nBaudry et al., 1997b). In particular, a transient, broadband burst of induced gamma-band activity is \noften observed in studies that require classification of foveally presented objects. The amplitude of \nsuch induced GBA is attenuated for repeated presentations of the same meaningful object (Gruber et \nal., 2004; Gruber and M\u00fcller, 2002) leading to suggestions that it could be a neural correlate of a \nrelatively late stream of representational processing connected to visual memory processes. This \nrelatively short, induced GBA burst observed in object classification paradigms does not seem to be a \nmere fixed-latency epiphenomenon of visual perception. Martinovic et al. (2008a; 2007) have related \nthe peak latency of the induced GBA to the time point of object classification. In these studies, \nparticipants covertly named two-dimensional line drawings of objects that are characterised by a \npredominant environmental orientation (chair, house or cow, for example). The objects were presented \neither in their everyday orientation or misoriented in the picture plane ( 60\u00b0 or 120\u00b0). Classification \nof such misoriented images is delayed due to the necessity to employ view-dependent recognition \nprocesses while accessing the name of the object (Jolicoeur et al., 1998; Lawson and Jolicoeur, 1998, \n2003). Martinovic et al. (2008a; 2007) found that the delay in induced GBA\u2019s peak latency \ncorresponded to delays in response times for misoriented objects, connecting the time-course of \ninduced GBA to the timing of representational processing.  \nInduced GBA \u2013 fact or artifact? \nExtensive research on induced high frequency oscillations in animals and humans has convincingly \nrelated this response to representational processes that occur during visual cognition. However, a recent \nstudy by Yuval-Greenberg et al. (2008) has questioned the cortical origin of induced GBA in EEG by \ndemonstrating that the contraction of ocular muscles during miniature eye movements can cause high \nfrequency artifacts in EEG. The dynamics of these miniature saccades are similar to induced GBA, \npeaking at around 200-350 ms. Yuval-Greenberg et al. (2009) have subsequently called for a full re-\nevaluation of EEG research into induced GBA that reported transient bursts of broadband activity. It is \nindeed essential to determine whether a scalp-recorded response is influenced by a) effects of \nmicrosaccades on genuine visual processing or b) transient oculomotor potentials occurring in the high \nfrequency range of the EEG. Microsaccades play an important role in vision and are well-known to be \naffected by both sensory and cognitive factors (for recent reviews see Martinez-Conde et al., 2009; \nRolfs, 2009). These miniature fixational eye movements play a very complex role in perception, \nmodulating neuronal firing rates in both striate (V1) and extrastriate cortex (V2, V4) within approx. \n100-120 ms of the execution of the eye movement (Leopold and Logothetis, 1998). In Yuval-\nGreenberg et al. (2008), the observed connection between microsaccades and induced GBA in the EEG \nwas correlational \u2013 microsaccades coincided with GBA, indicating an artifactual origin. But \nmicrosaccades and induced gamma band activity could also correlate because they are triggered by the \nsame perceptual processes. In line with this idea, Bosman et al. (2009) studied gamma-band activity in \nareas V1 and V4 of awake monkeys and found that microsaccadic patterns affected synchronisation in \nthe gamma-band range, which in turn predicted the response latency variability. Moreover, onsets of \nmicrosaccade influenced activity in the visual cortex correspond tightly to the timing of the earliest \nbursts of induced high frequency oscillations, with microsaccadic activity peaking at approx. 90-120 \nms in V1 to V4 (Leopold and Logothetis, 1998) and induced gamma-band activity peaking at around \n100 ms in V1 and 140 ms in V4 (Rols et al., 2001).  \nOther studies also suggest that there is more to induced GBA in EEG than being a mere artifact of \nsaccadic spike potentials. Several recent studies reveal transient increases in activity during visual \nworking memory or face classification paradigms which cannot be explained as occular artifacts since \nthe topographic EEG maps do not exhibit artifact-associated increases at frontal sites (Haenschel et al., \n2009; Uhlhaas et al., 2009). Furthermore, accounts of induced GBA as an artifact or as a genuine \nreflection of cortical activity are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Both microsaccadic patterns and \nbrain activity can be influenced by common cognitive factors, and both occur in a similar time window. \nThus, it is possible that a large-amplitude artifactual response in the EEG could obscure a much \nsmaller, cortically generated oscillation. Therefore, it is essential to develop tools for artifact removal \nthat will permit the exclusion of signals induced by ocular muscle activity during microsaccades (Keren \net al., 2010). Independent component analysis (ICA) methods are currently under development and \ninitial results look extremely promising - after removing transient spike potentials that accompany \nminiature eye movements, an ongoing narrowband (50-70 Hz) oscillatory response can be revealed \n(Hassler and Gruber, 2009). This indicates that it is possible to obtain a high frequency signal from the \ncortex by using scalp EEG and indicates a positive outlook for the future of non-invasive human \nresearch into mechanisms of cortical object representation. Further studies are needed to fully specify \nthe relation of microsaccades and oscillatory synchrony (see Melloni et al., 2009). Once reliable tools \nfor removal of occular artifacts have been developed, some studies on object representation and \ninduced GBA (e.g. Martinovic et al., 2008a; Martinovic et al., 2007, which focused on the transient \npeak itself) will need to be re-examined to assess if the observed transient GBA bursts reflected a \nmodulation of eye movements, modulation of high frequency oscillatory synchrony, or both. \nFuture directions \nRelations between microsaccades and induced high frequency oscillatory activity are currently one \nof the most important research topics. When humans freely observe complex visual scenes, salient \nfeatures such as human faces attract most fixations, and microsaccadic rates are highest whilst \nfoveating such locations (Otero-Millan et al., 2008). Both evoked and induced GBA are also highest for \nfoveally presented stimuli (Busch et al., 2004; Swettenham et al., 2009). Furthermore, induced GBA \namplitude is modulated by the amount of perceptual resources that can be allocated to the foveally-\npresented unattended objects (Martinovic et al., 2009). The role of gamma-band oscillations in attentive \nas opposed to inattentive processing both peripherally and foveally needs to be explored further, as the \nstrategic functions of visual attention are likely to vary retinotopically (Handy and Khoe, 2005). While \nthere may be a tight relation between microsaccades and induced GBA for stimuli presented foveally, a \ndifferent pattern may emerge for peripherally presented attended or unattended stimuli. It is also \nnecessary to explore the dynamics of gamma-band oscillations in high-level visual, temporal and \nprefrontal areas during complex activities such as reading (Jung et al., 2008). Measures of directed \ncortical information flow between sources of gamma-band activity (Supp et al., 2007) can also reveal \nmuch about the particular ways in which different brain regions interact within the perceptual and \nattentional networks. These measures could be particularly useful in determining the dynamics of \noccasionally reported induced GBA decreases relative to baseline \u2013 Lachaux et al. (2005) observed that \nconcurrently with the activation of higher-level visual areas, V1 gamma synchrony decreases and Jung \net al. (2008) observed decreases in ventral lateral prefrontal cortex for attended words concurrently \nwith persistent enhancements in posterior areas. The role of these desynchronisations is not fully \nunderstood but it is assumed that they are likely to reflect the supression of processing in task-irrelevant \nbrain regions. Finally, the properties of miniature eye movement artifacts that can affect induced GBA \nin EEG recordings need to be fully specified, and methods of artifact removal have to be perfected \n(Keren et al., 2010). The possibility that object classification can be reflected in early, involuntary eye \nmovements is in itself very intriguing and worthy of further research. \nSchroeder and Lakatos (2009) proposed that attentional selection is achieved by utilising the \nregularities of the visual environment as well as regularities in exploratory motor and eye movement \npatterns in order to enforce oscillatory entrainment to a task-relevant input stream. They propose that in \nthe absence of a low frequency rhythm that oscillations can entrain to, attention is characterised by an \nextended increase in gamma-band synchrony. It would be promising to investigate gamma-band \nactivity in paradigms that require ongoing visually-guided behaviour or ongoing observation of \ndynamic, complex visual scenes in order to examine patterns of oscillatory synchrony in multiple \nfrequency bands that relate to both the processing of the visual stimulus and of the required response. \nOngoing gamma-band activity has already been demonstrated during the 5-second observation of \nrotating ambiguous figures (Keil et al., 1999).  \nWith regards to evoked GBA, the main open question concerns the early objecthood effects which \nare not consistently reported but do seem to occur with certain stimulus sets and tasks.  By selecting a \nset of images of real, meaningful objects and then parametrically modulating the properties of the \nnonsense, scrambled versions of these objects it could be possible to ascertain which attributes are \ncrucial in driving the modulations of evoked GBA amplitude. This could indicate whether the effects of \ncoarse classification depend on certain uncontrolled low-level image attributes (e.g. visual complexity, \naspect ratio) or if they are due to the closed or open line structure of the stimuli, which can be \nindicative of objecthood. \nConcluding comments \nVision must rely on mechanisms that allow for flexible and dynamic coding between distributed \nneural assemblies. The nature of these mechanisms presents a fundamental question for visual \nneuroscience. High frequency oscillatory synchrony is a likely candidate for one such mechanism since \nit allows neurons to rapidly fall in and out of assemblies that code for various aspects of visual scenes, \ncoordinating dispersed activity elicited by a single object or event. This role of GBA in neuronal \ncommunication is, of course, not limited to visual processing, and is likely to be essential to cortical \ncomputation itself. \nAlthough high frequency oscillatory synchrony is most likely a mechanism of broad \nsignificance for efficient neuronal communication, the attributes of gamma-band synchrony in vision \nstrongly suggest that it is not simply a non-specific marker of cognitive effort: it is established between \nneurons and neuronal assemblies in the visual cortex both before and after the onset of task relevant \nevents and exhibits complex patterns of propagation through ventral and dorsal visual streams during \nthe representation of meaningful, coherent objects. Correlations between gamma-band synchrony and \nbehaviour further demonstrate their genuine role in representational processes occurring in vision. \nThese findings strongly support the assumption that evoked gamma-band activity reflects an interface \nof bottom-up and top-down visual processing, while induced high frequency synchrony plays a crucial \nrole in subserving efficient information intake and processing during attentive vision. \n Acknowledgments \nThe authors would like to thank Corinna Haenschel for helpful comments on previous versions of \nthe manuscript and Matt Craddock for proofreading one of the final versions of the manuscript.  \n \nReferences \nBar, M., 2003.
