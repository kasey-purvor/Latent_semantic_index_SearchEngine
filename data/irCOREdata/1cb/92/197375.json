Introduction\nMicroscopic probes have always played an important role in\nthe exploration of the unique properties of liquid helium\n(LHe). Examples of these are electrons. Electrons were used\nto identify the rotation of helium in single vortex lines1,2 and\nthey were also used in early mobility measurements3 leading to\nthe discovery of negative charge localisation in large voids.4\nThis localisation and the establishment of spherical \u2018cavities\u2019\naround electrons at a critical density and temperature is the\ncause of a large drop in mobility of over more than four orders\nof magnitude.5 An electron confined in a cavity gives rise to\nquantised energy eigenstates and the existence of cavities was\nlater nicely demonstrated when these states were probed by\ninfrared spectroscopy.6,7\nThe formation of cavities has its origin in the predominantly\nrepulsive interactions of ground state helium atoms. Their size\nresults from the balance of forces of this repulsion and the\nsurface energy.8,9 Electron cavity radii are typically on the\norder of 15 A\u02da, but depend on the hydrostatic pressure.10 In\ndense helium gas, cavities exist as well. There, like in the\nnormal liquid phase, the motion is governed by the laws of\nhydrodynamical (Stokes) flow, whereas in the superfluid state\ninteractions with collective excitations (phonons, rotons and\nvortices) become dominant.11 In all of these flow regimes the\nradius of the spherical cavities determines the mobility. In the\ngas phase at lower densities, cavities are not supported. In this\nregime the mobility is governed by gas-kinetic type behaviour.\nWith decreasing temperature and increasing density a point is\nreached where the mobility dramatically decreases. This point\ncan be interpreted as the onset of cavity formation. Low\ntemperatures assist the localisation process which is reflected\nby a shift in the mobility transition region to higher densities\nwith increasing temperature.5 Cavity formation around\nelectrons in LHe has been studied extensively using various\nmethods12,13 including density function theory (DFT).14\u201317\nDFT methods specially developed for LHe provide good\nagreement with first principles methods for small helium\nclusters,18 but have the disadvantage that they are restricted\nto zero Kelvin. Despite all these efforts, the precise prediction\nof the transition from gas-kinetic to hydrodynamic flow still\nremains a challenge for theory. Presently available models\nprovide only limited accuracy in predicting electron mobilities,\neven when far from the transition zone. Furthermore, mobility\ndata covering the transition density regime is rather sparse and\nmakes it difficult to test existing theory.\nWe have therefore undertaken a series of measurements for\nliquid and supercritical helium using the method of corona\ndischarges for charge generation. We derived mobilities from\nI(V) curves measured in a point-plane electrode arrangement.19\nFurthermore, we have developed a semi-empirical model to\ncalculate mobilities and cavity radii. The precise determination\nof mobilities requires knowledge of the surface energy.\nCommonly, the surface tension of helium is employed, but\nthis is problematic.20,21 The surface tension deviates for curved\nsurfaces and is not defined for all hydrostatic pressures (P) and\ntemperatures (T), especially in low density regions of super-\ncritical gas. Adjusted values for the surface tension in LHe\nhave been employed17 but do not resolve the problem. Fig. 1\nvisualises the difference between measured and predicted\nmobilities, using the popular \u2018bubble\u2019 model. The semi-\nempirical thermodynamic model that we introduce in this\npaper circumvents the use of surface tension. It is based on\nthe free-volume concept22,23 and employs the electron scattering\nlength and appropriate thermodynamic state equations as the\nonly input.\nDespite its semi-empirical nature our approach represents\nan important step towards a better understanding of the\nelectron localisation process as it predicts mobilities and cavity\nradii with much greater precision than any other existing\ntheory.

Cavities\nalso exist around electronically excited helium atoms and\nhelium excimers in Rydberg states. Although these species\nare neutral, their cavities are very similar to those around\nelectrons. For neutral Rydberg species, the void is created by\nthe repulsive interaction between the Rydberg-electron\norbiting around the positive core with the surrounding ground\nstate helium atoms. There are nevertheless differences in size\nbecause the Rydberg-electron is still attracted by the positive\ncore. Neutral Rydberg-cavity systems are inaccessible to mobility\nmeasurements, but they provide a rich source of spectroscopic\ninformation as first demonstrated by Dennis and coworkers\nfor high-energy electron-beam-excited bulk LHe,24,25 Femto-\nsecond laser-excited LHe26,27 and for helium droplets photo-\nexcited by synchrotron radiation.28\u201330 Recently, corona discharges\nhave been employed to excite supercritical and bulk LHe\nand a rich fluorescence spectrum similar to that when using\nelectron beams and synchrotron radiation was observed.31,32\nRydberg-cavities are important as spectroscopic probes of\nmicroscopic states of helium. The concept for deriving the size\nof electron cavities is transferable to Rydberg cavities and will\nbe relevant for future investigations of LHe.\nThe electron mobilities presented in this paper were measured\nin supercritical gas at 6, 7 and 10 K as well as in LHe at 4.2 K.\nThe advantage of using point-plane electrode geometry in a\ncorona discharge is that it naturally generates electrons and\nthat it provides for the establishment of very high pressures so\nthat a wide density range can be covered. Where data is\navailable in the literature, we find a good match with our\nresults. Our semi-emipirical model fits the measured electron\nmobilities better than any other available model. The improve-\nment is particularly evident for supercritical helium.\n2. Experiment\nMobility measurements were carried out in a high-pressure cell\nthat was attached to a bath cryostat using a corona discharge\nto generate the charge carriers. Details of the set-up were\npublished in previous publications31\u201333 and here we give only a\nbrief description. Helium gas of purity level 99.9999%\nwas passed through a series of liquid nitrogen-cooled cold\ntraps and activated charcoal filters and introduced into the\nhigh-pressure cell. The corona discharge was established in\npoint-plane geometry. For this geometry, previous workers\nhave found that the current is unipolar space charge-limited\nand concentrated along the tip axis,34,35 both for gases and\nliquids. In liquids, the current depends quadratically on the\nvoltage:\nI \u00bc Ctme \u00f0V \u0003 V0\u00de\n2\nd\n\u00f01\u00de\nwhere I represents the current, d the distance between tip and\nplane, Ct is a constant, m the mobility, e the dielectric constant\n(e0er) and V and V0 the voltage and the threshold voltage.\n35\nThe mobility can be obtained from a linear fit of the square\nroot of the current plotted against the voltage. In this plot the\nstraight, asymtotic part of the\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nI\u00f0V\u00dep graph is identical to the\nmobility. Ct in eqn (1) is derived by comparison with experi-\nments using other methods such as the time of flight for the\nderivation of the mobility. Taking Ct = 2 leads to a good\nagreement with experiment36 as well as with theory.37\n3. Results\nI(V) curves were recorded for 4.2, 6, 7 and 10 K as a function\nof the hydrostatic pressure and mobilities were derived using\neqn (1) according to the above procedure. Fig. 2 shows the\nelectron mobilities at 4.2 K alongside the mobilities as reported\nin the literature.38,39 Also, the mobilities have been calculated\nusing the common bubble method, as well as our model.\nFig. 1 Electron mobilities in LHe measured at 2.2, 3 and 4.2 K as a\nfunction of the normalised density N\/Ncr, where Ncr relates to the\ncritical density. In this region in particular, the \u2018bubble\u2019-model com-\nmonly used shows significant deviations from the experimental data,\nfor instance, the maximum at N\/Ncr = 2.2 cannot be reproduced. The\nthree vertical lines at Ns\/Ncr refer to the ratio between the density at\nsaturated vapour pressureNs and the density at the critical pointNcr of\n69.641 kg m\u00033.\nFig. 2 Pressure dependence of electron mobilities measured at 4.2 K\nbyMeyer et al.,38 Keshishev et al.39 and in this work.

Our data covers\nparticularly the low pressure region (0.1\u20131 MPa) since electron\nmobilities in this pressure range have only been sparsely\nreported in the literature. Fig. 3 shows the mobilities in LHe\nas a function of the normalised density.\nWe also investigated the effect of the tip size by using two\ndifferent tips with a radius of 0.45 and 2.5 mm, respectively, to\nascertain that the way we derive the mobilities from the I(V)\ncurves works. No difference was observed.\n4. Discussion\nIn helium gas at low density the electron is free and its mobility\nm0 is governed by the laws of gas-kinetics:\nm0 \u00bc\n4e\n3Nq\u00f02pmekbT\u00de1=2\n\u00f02\u00de\nwhere e and m are the electron charge and mass, respectively,\nN the number density, q the momentum transfer cross-section\n(constant for helium, q= 5\u0004 10\u000320 m2) and kB the Boltzmann\nconstant.\nAt higher gas densities an electron can interact with several\natoms simultaneously40 and consequently the mobility m0\nthat was derived in eqn (2) on the assumption of single\natom-electron interactions does not fully match experimental\ndata. These deviations can be corrected using the following\nexpression:\nm \u00bc m0\u00f01\u0003\nffiffiffi\np\np\nmeNq\u00de \u00f03\u00de\nwhere m refers to the corrected mobility and leNq to the ratio\nbetween the electron de Broglie wavelength le and the classical\nmean free path length 1\/Nq. Eqn (3) is only accurate for small\nle (fast electrons) and as it takes only first order density\ncorrections into account it is only valid for moderate correc-\ntions m\/m0 4 0.3.\nThe mobilities m calculated in this way agree well with\nexperimental data up to densities N\/Ncr D 0.15, where Ncr\nrefers to the critical density. At higher relative densities N\/Ncr\na transition from a quasi-free to a localised state takes place\nwhich is observed through an abrupt decrease of the electron\nmobility from 100 cm2 V s\u00031 to 0.1 cm2 V s\u00031. In this region,\nbelow 0.1 cm2 V s\u00031, the Knudsen number becomes lower than\n1 and therefore a hydrodynamical analysis, similar to the one\nproposed for LHe, can be used. Measurements of the mobility\nin the transition region are afflicted with a very large error\nbecause the changes are so rapid.\nThe physical process of electron-localisation can be explained\nby the minimisation of the large interaction energy between\nthe electron and helium atoms leading to the self-trapping of\nfree electrons in a void. Schmidt et al. described the trapping\nto proceed in multiple steps, the first step being the occasional\nlocalisation of the excess electron in an unstable density\nfluctuation of the liquid, and the second being stabilisation\nvia the formation of a larger cavity.41 The driving force in this\nprocess is the Pauli repulsion between the excess electron and\nthe surrounding helium atoms, with both of their electrons\nresiding in the 1s2 state, due to the Pauli principle. The\nelectron pushes the helium atoms away thereby acting against\nthe restoring force of the surface tension s(P,T) until an\nequilibrium cavity radius R is reached. In the first approxi-\nmation, it is the increased geometric cross-section of this cavity\nthat gives rise to the comparatively low mobilities of electrons\nin supercritical gas and LHe. From hydrodynamics we know\nthat for small velocities the viscous force Ff exerted on a sphere\nfollows Stokes law. Hence, the relation between mobility m and\ncavity radius R is as follows:\neE \u0003 Ff \u00bc 0! eE \u0003 4pRZv \u00bc 0\neE \u00bc 4pRZmE ! m \u00bc e\n4pRZ\n\u00f04\u00de\nHere, E is the electric field strength and Z(P,T) the dynamic\nviscosity of the fluid. We note that for the \u2018bubble model\u2019 a\ncoefficient of 0.8 \u0004 4p is commonly used12,42,43 because the\ncoefficient of 4p in the Stokes equation applies to bubbles\nwhereas the more familiar 6p is due to drops.44,45 It is reasonable\nto assume a spherical shape of the \u2018cavity\u2019 since the interaction\nbetween electron and helium atoms is isotropic and therefore\nthe radius R of a cavity can be derived from mobility data.\nIt is also possible to calculate the cavity radius from the\nequilibrium of forces acting on the cavity. The most frequently\nadopted approach calculates the equilibrium radius R by\nminimising the electron excess free energy with respect to the\nradius. The free energy is represented by the zero-point energy\nof an electron in a square-well-potential, the surface energy\nrepresented by the product of surface tension s (P,T) and\ncavity surface and the volume displacement work of the\nliquid.43\nEcavity \u00bc h\n2\n8mR2\n\u00fe 4pR2s\u00fe 4\n3\npR3P \u00f05\u00de\nFig. 3 Density dependence of electron mobilities measured in LHe\nat 4.2 K by Meyer et al.38 and by us (this work).

Furthermore, this model cannot reproduce\nthe variation in mobility as a function of pressure at different\ntemperatures. The reason for these deviations lies in the more\ncomplicated structure than that of a simple \u2018\u2018empty bubble\u2019\u2019\nwith a sharp interface. It is very reasonable to assume that the\nthickness of the cavity\u2013liquid interface is of similar order to\nthe liquid\u2013vapor interface of LHe, which is 7 A\u02da,46 and which is\nnot small compared to the cavity radius. Therefore, the use of\nthe concept of surface tension is not applicable here. A better\napproach is to transform the surface energy into a volume\nenergy similar to that of the work against hydrostatic pressure\nPV. A second reason for the deviations is that the surface\ntension s(P,T) is used for P and T values where it is not\ndefined. The surface tension is only defined at gas\u2013liquid\ninterface systems that are governed by the well-known\nsaturated vapour-pressure relationship between P and T, but\nthis relationship does not necessarily correspond to the con-\nditions at the interface between cavity and liquid.\nIn this section we demonstrate how mobilities can be\ncalculated more accurately. Essentially, we develop the thermo-\ndynamic equation of state for excess electrons in helium in the\nlimit of low concentrations using the free-volume concept. The\nmobilities calculated in this way show the pressure and tem-\nperature dependence without the limitation imposed by using\nthe surface tension. In the past, the free-volume concept was\nsuccessfully used to predict the properties of liquids and solids,\nsuch as the ionic conductivity.22,23 Our approach is more\ngeneric than the cavity model as it predicts the volume of\ncavities formed by the electrons regardless of its specific struc-\nture. The ingredients to calculate the size of the void that we use\nare the scattering length a for electrons in helium to represent\nthe Pauli repulsion and an appropriate thermodynamic state\nequation to represent attraction, i.e. the restoring forces similar\nto that of surface tension. The advantage of our model is its\napplicability to thermodynamic states in a much wider range, in\nparticular to states with low density. We will see that much\nbetter agreement with experimental data can be achieved.\nOur idea is based on the proportionality between the\nvolume of the object formed by excess electrons Ve and the\n\u2018free-volume\u2019 (V\u0003b) of the object where the term \u2018free volume\u2019\nrefers to the notation of the van der Waals state equation. The\nproportionality holds exact if the total volume is not changed\ntoo much when foreign objects are introduced. For excess\nelectrons this condition is clearly fulfilled since their quantity is\nnegligible compared to the total number of helium atoms in\nthe discharge cell. We replace (V\u0003b) by Vf and write for the\nvolume Ve of an electron cavity with arbitrary shape:\nVe \u00bc CVf\nN\n\u00f06\u00de\nwhere C is a constant of proportionality which we obtain here\nby fitting to the experimental data at 3 K (any other\ntemperature can be chosen as well) and N the number of\nhelium particles that are displaced by the foreign object. In this\nnotation a spherical cavity formed by the electron has the\nvolume Ve \u00bc 43pR3 and moves within the Stokes flow regime\ngiving rise to a mobility m related to R.\nThe free volume of LHe is a function of two independent\nthermodynamic parameters: P and T. The relation between\nthese quantities can be expressed through the classical van der\nWaals equation of state:\n\u00f0P\u00fePLHe\u00deVf\nN\n\u00bc kBT \u00f07\u00de\nwhere PLHe is the internal pressure. The internal pressure\nrepresents the attractive forces in the system (i.e. long range\nvan der Waals interaction) and generally depends on the\ntemperature T and the particle density r.\nOur aim is now to develop an expression for PLHe that\naccounts best for the physical properties of our system. We\nstart with the following generic equation to describe the\ndependence on local variations of the density:\nPLHe = f1(T)r\n2 + terms (8)\nThe extra terms in this equation account for the \u2018local\u2019 internal\npressure close to the foreign object where the attractive forces\nare non-isotropic. In our model we have chosen the following\nexpression:\nPLHe \u00bc\nar2 \u00fe b exp g rrs \u0003 exp g\n\u0003 \u0004\nT2\n\u00f09\u00de\nwhere r\/rs is the ratio between the density and the density of\nthe liquid for saturated vapor pressure at a given temperature\nT and a = 0.007, b = 4, g = 4.9. We note that when r\napproaches rs the second term vanishes and the equation for\nthe internal pressure assumes the van der Waals form.\nFor a supercritical gas eqn (9) has to be modified because\nthe only reference is the critical density. Therefore, it is\nreasonable to assume a similarity between the parameter\nPSupHe referring to the state equation in supercritical helium\nand PLHe with the supercritical density rs replaced by the\ncritical density rc and without the factor e\ng. The state equation\nfor PSupHe assumes then the following form:\nPSupHe \u00bc\nar2 \u00fe b exp rrc\nT2\n\u00f010\u00de\nwith the parameter a = 0.007, b = 4 of the liquid.\nTo derive the radius R of the cavity we assume proportion-\nality with the scattering length a and exploit the inverse\nproportionality with the free volume Vf. Hence, we find the\nfollowing empirical relation for the a and Vf dependence of the\ncavity radius R:\nR \u00bc a \u00f0Vref=Vf \u00de\n3\n1\u00fe 0:09\u00f0Vref=Vf \u00de3 exp \u00031:7Vref=Vf\n\u0003 \u0004 \u00f011\u00de\nVf can be expressed through the state equation Vref=Vf \u00bc\n4:5 p\u00feP\nT\nand it is then possible to calculate the cavity radius as a\nfunction of P and T by fitting the parameters in our empirical\n722 | Phys.

All pressures have\nto be entered in units of bar; the scattering length a is 0.062 nm;\nall constants are real constants and independent of the tempera-\nture. The behavior at the limits r- 0 isR-Ba and r-N is\nR- B11 nm.\nIn the regime of supercritical gas densities where a hydro-\ndynamical approach can be used (Knudsen number o 1) the\nagreement with experimental data is very good (Fig. 3). Fig. 4\nshows the measured and calculated electron mobilities for\nliquid and supercritical helium over a wide range of densities.\nThe dashed line refers to the common bubble model. It can be\nseen that our model produces very good fits in both the liquid\nand the supercritical regime.\nIt is difficult to assign the true origin of the rapid change in\nelectron mobility in the transition region. Firstly, this region is\ncharacterised by a cross-over from hydrodynamic to molecular\nflow, but this transition should be a gradual change, much less\nrapid than the observed change in mobility. Secondly, in the\nframework of hydrodynamic flow there are two possibilities\nto explain the increase of the electron mobility. On the one\nhand, for decreasing density r- 0 the viscosity also decreases\nZ- 0, but this decrease is relatively slow. On the other hand,\nit is also possible that the cavity radius R increases. The\nexperimental values show that this decrease in R must be\nmore rapid than that of Z. The fact that the cavity shrinks is in\ncontradiction with the \u2018bubble\u2019 model commonly used in the\nliterature. In this model the force acting against the electron\nrepulsion is the surface tension which is expected to decrease\nwith decreasing density. Hence, one would expect the cavity to\nincrease in size which clearly contradicts the experimental\ndata. Up to now there is no satisfying explanation of why\nthe mobility changes are so dramatic and why they take place\nparticularly at N\/Ncr D 0.15.\n5. Conclusions\nIn summary, we have presented new data on electron mobilities\nin supercritical and liquid helium. The new data allowed\nus to elaborate the density dependence in a region which is\nonly sparsely covered in the existing literature. To cover the\nwidest possible density range we generated free electrons in a\ncorona discharge using point-plane electrode geometry. This\nrelatively simple and versatile set-up allowed us to establish\npressures of up to 100 bar and temperatures down to 4 K. The\nmobilities were also simulated. We developed a new model for\nthe hydrodynamical flow regime that derives the electron\nmobilities from the electron scattering length in helium a\nrepresenting repulsion and an appropriate thermodynamic\nstate equation where the internal pressure P accounts for\nthe attraction. This approach circumvents the use of the\nsurface tension as commonly used in the \u2018bubble\u2019 model.\nThe common \u2018bubble\u2019 model is an easy-to-understand concept,\nbut is has some shortcomings: (i) it predicts cavity growth for\nlow-densities which is contradictory to experimental data\nand (ii) it employs surface tension values to thermodynamic\nstates where these are not defined. Our model overcomes\nthese shortcomings as it predicts the density-dependence\nof the electron mobility correctly. Also, the accuracy is\nunsurpassed by any other presently available model. Our\nsemi-empirical model makes use of parameters that are\nadjusted to experimental data. This adjustment is made\nonly once and the resulting equation to calculate electron\nmobilities or cavity sizes is universally applicable for all\nthermodynamic states within the molecular flow region. In\naddition to its practical use, our model may be useful to shed\nmore light on the microscopic properties of cavities in liquid\nand supercritical helium. For instance, if a microscopic theory\nof Stokes flow existed, more information on the cavity\u2013liquid\ninterface could be obtained because our model makes no\nassumption of the actual shape of the cavities. It just assigns\na hypothetical sphere of displaced helium atoms to the free\nvolume.\nAcknowledgements\nF.
