The mutual inhibition exerted by the 26 \ntranscription factors and the GC receptor (GR) represents a possible mechanism contributing to 27 \nGC insensitivity in asthma. We recently reported that Interferon Regulatory Factor (IRF)-1 is a 28 \nnovel transcription factor that promotes GC insensitivity in human airway smooth muscle 29 \n(ASM) cells by interfering with GR signaling (Tliba et al., 2008; Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 30 \n2008 Apr;38(4):463-72)). We sought to determine whether the inhibition of GR function by 31 \nIRF-1 involves its interaction with the transcriptional co-regulator GR-interacting protein 1 32 \n(GRIP-1), a known GR transcriptional co-activator. We here found that siRNA-mediated GRIP-33 \n1 depletion attenuated IRF-1-dependent gene transcription in cells transfected with a luciferase 34 \nreporter construct. Similarly siRNA GRIP-1 dramatically decreases the mRNA expression of a 35 \nIRF-1-dependent gene, CD38. In parallel experiments, we also found that silencing GRIP-1 36 \nsignificantly reduced GR-mediated transactivation activities. Immunoprecipitation and GST 37 \npull-down assays showed that GRIP-1, through its repression domain, physically interacts with 38 \nIRF-1identifying GRIP-1 as an essential transcriptional co-activator for IRF-1. Interestingly, the 39 \npreviously reported inhibition of GR-mediated transactivation activities by either TNF\u03b1 and 40 \nIFN\u03b3 treatment or IRF-1 over-expression was fully reversed by increasing cellular levels of 41 \nGRIP-1. Together, these data suggest that the cellular accumulation IRF-1 may represent a 42 \npotential molecular mechanism mediating altered cellular response to GC through the depletion 43 \nof GRIP-1 from the GR transcriptional regulatory complexes. 44 \nKey words: steroid insensitivity, asthma, glucocorticoid, cytokine, mesenchymal cells, 45 \nairway smooth muscle, transcription factor, remodeling, IRF-1, GRIP-1, GR. 46 \n  \n \n3 \n 47 \nGlucocorticoids (GCs) remain the cornerstone treatment for chronic inflammatory 48 \ndiseases such as asthma (1). Five to ten percent of the asthmatic patients, however, develop 49 \nsteroid insensitivity. Therefore, an unmet need requires the exploration of alternative 50 \ntherapeutic targets to be used in conjunction with or separately from GCs (2). A strong 51 \ncorrelation between steroid insensitivity and inflammatory diseases, such as asthma, nasal 52 \npolyps and inflammatory bowel disease (3-5), prompted investigators to examine whether 53 \ninflammatory mediators modulate the cellular responses to steroids. Using peripheral blood 54 \nmononuclear cells (PBMCs), investigators showed that GC effects were dramatically reduced in 55 \nthe presence of cytokines. Leung\u2019s group was the first to show that IL-2 and IL-4 reduced the 56 \ninhibitory effect of methylprednisolone on mitogen-induced T cell proliferation (6). Other 57 \ncytokines such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IFN\u03b3 to IL-2, IL-7, IL-13, IL-15 or IL-8 also attenuate 58 \ndexamethasone effects in PBMCs (7-10), proliferating T cells, monocytes and neutrophils. 59 \nThus, cytokines may promote the development of steroid insensitivity seen in patients with 60 \nasthma by reducing cell\/tissue sensitivity to GCs. 61 \nDespite considerable efforts in immune cells, the alteration of steroid responsiveness in 62 \nstructural cell types of the target tissues remains poorly defined. We have been studying the 63 \nmodulation of steroid responsiveness in airway smooth muscle (ASM) which is increasingly 64 \nrecognized as an important player in the pathogenesis of asthma by driving airway inflammation 65 \n(11) and may therefore be a target for inhaled GCs (12). Accordingly, we and others showed that 66 \nGCs were effective in abrogating the expression of a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines, 67 \nchemokines and adhesion molecules in ASM cells when exposed to a \u201csingle\u201d pro-inflammatory 68 \nstimulus (13). Yet, we recently found that steroid insensitivity can develop in ASM exposed to a 69 \n  \n \n4 \n\u201cmixture\u201d of pro-asthmatic cytokines. Treatment of ASM cells with the specific combination of 70 \nIFNs with TNF\u03b1 impairs the ability of GCs to inhibit the expression of calcium regulatory 71 \nprotein CD38, the chemokines RANTES and fractalkine, and cell surface proteins such as 72 \nICAM-1 and Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2) (8). 73 \nThe mechanisms underlying cytokine-induced steroid insensitivity in ASM cells have not 74 \nbeen completely defined but we recently showed that a \u201cshort-term\u201d treatment of ASM cells with 75 \nIFNs and TNF\u03b1 partially inhibits steroid transactivation through the accumulation of interferon 76 \nregulatory factor (IRF)-1 (14), an early response gene involved in diverse transcriptional 77 \nregulatory processes (15). Interestingly, polymorphism in IRF-1 has been associated with 78 \nchildhood atopic asthma (16). Because expression of IRF-1 is increased after viral infections (17) 79 \nand because IRF-1 suppresses steroid effectiveness in ASM cells (14), we proposed that IRF-1 80 \nmay mediate the reduced steroid responsiveness seen in patients with asthma experiencing viral 81 \ninfections (18). 82 \nThe precise transcriptional mechanism by which IRF-1 interferes with GC signaling 83 \nremains to be determined. Most anti-inflammatory effects of steroids are conferred by the GC 84 \nreceptor (GR), a ligand-dependent transcriptional regulator that suppresses the expression of 85 \ninflammatory genes (3).  Steroid receptor coactivator (SRC)\/p160 family members (SRC1, 86 \nSRC2\/Transcriptional Intermediary Factor 2 (TIF2)\/GR Interacting Protein-1 (GRIP-1), and 87 \nSRC3\/Receptor-Associated Co-activator 3 (RAC3)\/p300\/CREB binding protein (CBP)-co-88 \nintegrator protein (pCIP)\/Amplified in Breast 1 (AIB1)) serve as co-activators for all nuclear 89 \nreceptors including GR. As such, this family of proteins interacts with ligand-bound GR to 90 \nrecruit histone acetyltransferases (CBP\/p300) and coactivator-associated arginine 91 \nmethyltransferase 1 (CARM1) that unpack the condensed chromatin, thereby facilitating the 92 \n  \n \n5 \naccess of transcription factors to target genes. Unlike other p160s, GRIP-1 also possesses a 93 \nunique GR co-repressor activity facilitating GC-mediated repression of Activator Protein (AP)-1 94 \nand Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB) activities (19, 20). Although, originally identified as a 95 \nnuclear receptor co-factor, GRIP-1 was later shown to engage in physical and functional 96 \ninteractions with an IRF family member, IRF-3, and serves as an IRF-3 co-activator in 97 \nmacrophages (21). Yet, the role of GRIP-1 in ASM cells has not been assessed. Here we 98 \ncharacterized whether GRIP-1 is a component of the IRF-1 transcriptional regulatory complexes 99 \nand whether such interactions affect the response of ASM cells to GCs.  100 \n 101 \nMATERIALS AND METHODS 102 \nASM Cell Culture and Characterization. Primary human ASM cells were isolated from the 103 \ntrachealis muscle of lung transplant donors and purified as described (22) in accordance with 104 \nprocedures approved by the University of Pennsylvania Committee on Studies Involving Human 105 \nBeings.  106 \nTransfection of ASM Cells. ASM cells were transfected using Basic Nucleofector Kit for 107 \nPrimary Smooth Muscle Cells according to manufacturer's instructions using Amaxa 108 \nNucleofector II device (program U-25) (Amaxa Biosystems, Cologne, Germany) (14). Small 109 \ninterfering RNA experiments were performed using siRNA Test Kit for Cell Lines and Adherent 110 \nPrimary Cells according to manufacturer's instructions (Amaxa Biosystems) (14).  ASM cells 111 \nwere transfected (14) using 2 \u00b5g of different constructs (IRF-1 was kindly provided by Dr. 112 \nYokosawa, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Japan (23); GRIP-1 was 113 \nconstructed as described previously (21)), and\/or 2 \u00b5g of GC responsive element (GRE)-114 \ndependent luciferase reporter plasmid (Clontech Laboratories Inc., Mountain View, CA), and\/or 115 \n  \n \n6 \n2 \u00b5g of IRF-1\u2013dependent luciferase reporter plasmid (Panomics, Inc., Fremont, CA), and\/or 100  116 \nnM with the combination of three different Silencer Pre-designed small interfering RNA 117 \n(siRNA) GRIP-1 (CACAGGAAUGAUUGGUAA, GGAGAUUGAUAGAGCCUUA, 118 \nGACAAGGGUUGAAUAUGA) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and 1 \u00b5g of \u03b2-119 \ngalactosidase vector (used to normalize transfection efficiency) (Promega, Madison, WI). 120 \nControls included the parallel use of pcDNA3 empty vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and\/or 121 \nscramble nonsilencing siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The activities of luciferase and \u03b2-122 \ngalactosidase were evaluated using luciferase and \u03b2-galactosidase detection kits (Promega), 123 \nrespectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions (14). The reporter luciferase activities 124 \nwere normalized to \u03b2-galactosidase activity and expressed as relative luminescence unit (RLU). 125 \nData were then expressed as percentage of controls (means \u00b1 SEM). 126 \nImmunoblot Analysis. Immunoblot analysis for GRIP-1, IRF-1 and GR was performed as 127 \ndescribed previously (14). To ensure equal loading, the membranes were stripped and reprobed 128 \nwith anti\u2013\u03b2-actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitations using the IRF-1, 129 \nGRIP-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and GR antibodies (Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO) 130 \nwere performed as previously described (14). 131 \nIn vitro Binding. Glutathione S-Transferase (GST)-tagged IRF-1 was expressed in Escherichia 132 \ncoli, purified and tested for its ability to interact with in vitro transcribed\/translated GRIP-1 133 \nderivatives as previously described (21). The gels were stained with Coomassie blue (not shown) 134 \nand autoradiographed. 135 \nRT-PCR Analysis. Total RNAs were extracted from human ASM cells using RNeasy Mini Kit 136 \n(Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as previously described (14) using CD38, MPK-1 and GAPDH primers 137 \nas reported earlier (14, 24, 25). GRIP-1 primers were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. 138 \n  \n \n7 \nIn preliminary experiments, we determined, for each primer pair, the melting temperature and 139 \nnumber of amplification cycles necessary to yield the appropriate PCR product size. 140 \nSubsequently, only one representative gel within the linear range is presented. The semi-141 \nquantitative PCR approach was performed in parallel analyzing the intensity of the area density 142 \nof each PCR band using a Gel-Pro Analyzer (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD), and the 143 \nPCR results are expressed as a ratio of area density of MKP-1 or CD38 to GAPDH. All 144 \nexperiments were performed in three different cell lines.   145 \nMaterials and Reagents. Tissue culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). 146 \nHuman recombinant (r) TNF\u03b1 and rIFN\u03b3 were provided by Roche Diagnostics (Indianapolis, 147 \nIN). Fluticasone propionate (FP) was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).  148 \nStatistical Analysis. Data points from individual assays represent the mean values of triplicate 149 \nmeasurements. Significant differences among groups were assessed with analysis of variance 150 \n(Bonferroni-Dunn test) or by t test analysis, with values of P < 0.05 sufficient to reject the null 151 \nhypothesis for all analyses. Each set of experiments was performed with a minimum of three 152 \ndifferent human ASM cell lines.  153 \n 154 \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION 155 \nGRIP-1 is essential for GR-dependent gene transcription in ASM cells. Although GCs 156 \nsuppress activities of some but not all cytokine-induced inflammatory genes (11), the underlying 157 \nmolecular mechanisms appear complex since GC actions are highly promoter- and cell type-158 \nspecific (13). Although GRIP-1 is a well-established GR receptor co-activator, its role in GC 159 \nfunction is also complex as it can affect both GR transactivation and transrepression activities 160 \n(19). As shown in Figure 1A, GRIP-1 was expressed in ASM whole cell extracts, and that 161 \n  \n \n8 \nexpression was unaffected by cytokine and\/or steroid treatments. Our finding is in agreement 162 \nwith previous studies showing the conserved expression of GRIP-1 in a variety of smooth muscle 163 \ncells including smooth muscle of gastrointestinal and urinary tracts, uterus, epididymis, prostate 164 \nand bronchioles of murine tissues (26). Interestingly, we observed a physical interaction between 165 \nendogenous GR and GRIP-1, and FP treatment significantly enhances this association (Figure 166 \n1B) suggesting that GRIP-1 recruitment to GR is a prerequisite step to initiate GR transcriptional 167 \nactivity. Whether GR also binds to other p160 members of the SRC family, as suggested by 168 \nothers (27), remains to be further investigated in ASM. Moreover, we provide the first 169 \ndemonstration of a role of GRIP-1 in GR-dependent gene expression in ASM cells. Indeed, the 170 \nactivity of a reporter construct containing luciferase reporter gene driven by GRE motifs was 171 \ninduced by FP, and GRIP-1 siRNA (but not control siRNA) partially decreased such induction 172 \n(Figure 1C, top). Of note, specific siRNA GRIP-1 dramatically and efficiently reduced GRIP-1 173 \nprotein contents (by 91%, Figure 1C, bottom). siRNA-GRIP-1, but not control siRNA, also 174 \nreduced by more than 50% FP-induced expression of Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase 175 \nPhosphatase 1 (MKP-1) (24, 28, 29) (Figure 1D). This observation provides the first 176 \nphysiological relevance of GRIP-1 in driving the expression of GC-inducible genes in airway 177 \nstructural cells. This finding is also clinically relevant as MKP-1 has recently gained a lot of 178 \nattention as a factor mediating GC inhibition of a number of pro-asthmatic responses in ASM 179 \nincluding expression of inflammatory genes IL-6, GRO-\u03b1, and CD38 (24, 28, 29) as well as cell 180 \nproliferation (30). By regulating the transactivation of GR-inducible proteins (31), our study 181 \nidentifies GRIP-1 as a critical factor in driving the anti-inflammatory actions of GC in ASM.   182 \nIRF-1-induced transcription requires GRIP-1. We recently developed a cellular model 183 \nof steroid insensitivity where GC-induced suppression of inflammatory genes (CD38, 184 \n  \n \n9 \nfractalkine) was drastically reduced in the presence of pro-asthmatic cytokines TNF\u03b1\/IFN\u03b3 (8, 185 \n14, 25, 32). Cytokine-induced GC insensitivity was mediated, at least in part, by the transcription 186 \nfactor IRF-1 (14) that interfered with GR transactivation activities, although the underlying 187 \nmechanisms remain unknown. We first examined whether IRF-1 interacts with GRIP-1. Full-188 \nlength IRF-1 fused to GST was tested for its ability to bind different GRIP-1 derivatives 189 \nincluding: Nuclear Receptor Interaction Domain (NID) (aa 565-765), known to bind GR (19, 190 \n20), 2-repression domain (RD) (aa 648-1007) containing nuclear receptor (NR) boxes 2 and 3 191 \nand the co-repression domain, 3-RD (aa 715-1007) containing NR box 3 and the co-repression 192 \ndomain and RD alone (aa 765-1007) (Figure 2A, top). Interestingly, all but the NID interacted 193 \nwith IRF-1 (Figure 2A, bottom) suggesting a direct GRIP-1:IRF-1 interaction and defining RD 194 \nas the minimal fragment of GRIP-1 that associates with IRF-1. In addition, the interaction 195 \nbetween GRIP-1 and IRF-1 was further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation using ASM whole 196 \ncell lysate (Figure 2B). Such interaction was weakly detected in basal but dramatically enhanced 197 \nafter cytokine treatment. Interestingly, the fact that GRIP-1:IRF-1 interacts in vitro without any 198 \ninducer, raising the interesting hypothesis that the close proximity of IRF-1 with GRIP-1 is the 199 \nmain factor that will drive such interaction. Unless cells are exposed to cytokines that leads to 200 \nIRF accumulation in the nucleus, not much interaction with GRIP1 can be expected under basal 201 \nconditions where IRF-1 expression is minimal and mostly in the cytoplasm. This is certainly true 202 \nfor IRF3 (Reilly et al., EMBO J. 2006 Jan 11;25(1):108-17) and IRF-1 ((Tliba et al., J Biol 203 \nChem. 2003 Dec 12;278(50):50615-23)), IRF-7, and IRF-9 (Rogatsky, unpublished data). It 204 \nseems, however, unlikely that GRIP-1:IRF-1 in vivo interaction requires GR. Indeed, our initial 205 \nco-imunoprecipitation studies failed to detect any interaction between IRF-1 and GR in ASM 206 \ncells treated with cytokines and\/or glucocorticoids (Tliba, unpublished data). Similarly, in 207 \n  \n \n10 \nmacrophages, Reilly et al., (EMBO J. 2006 Jan 11;25(1):108-17)  and Ogawa et al., (Cell. 2005 208 \nSep 9;122(5):707-21) were also unable to detect any interaction between IRF-3 and GR. 209 \nWe next investigated whether GRIP-1 recruitment to IRF-1 is functional and investigated 210 \nwhether manipulating GRIP-1 levels modulates IRF-1 transactivation activities. The use of 211 \nsilencing strategies demonstrated that the siRNA to GRIP-1 (but not siRNA controls) reduced by 212 \nmore than 57% TNF\u03b1\/IFN\u03b3-induced IRF-1-dependent reporter gene activity (Figure 2C). GRIP-213 \n1 depletion also abrogated the expression of CD38, an IRF-1-dependent gene in ASM cells (14) 214 \nas shown by the 47% reduction of cytokine-induced CD38 mRNA up-regulation (Figure 2D). 215 \nAlthough SRC family members interact with other transcription factors and regulators such as 216 \nAP-1, Serum Response Factor (SRF), NF-\u03baB, CREB, and as muscle-specific factor, myocyte 217 \nenhancer factor 2C (MEF2C) (20, 31, 33-35), our findings are the first to demonstrate that GRIP-218 \n1 also interacts with IRF-1 and modulates IRF-1 transactivation activities. Together, these 219 \nobservations suggest that IRF-1-induced transcription requires GRIP-1 and raise the hypothesis 220 \nthat an excess of IRF transcription factors could potentially affect GC function by competing 221 \nwith GR for GRIP-1 required for GC transcriptional functions.  222 \nRecruitment of GRIP-1 by IRF-1 mediates cytokine-induced GR dysfunction. We 223 \npreviously showed that inflammatory cytokines (TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3) promote steroid insensitivity 224 \nin ASM cells by inhibiting GR transactivation activity, an effect mediated by IRF-1 (14). 225 \nInterestingly, GR competition for GRIP-1 was shown to be critical in antagonizing IRF-3-226 \nregulated transcription in macrophages (21). We therefore examined whether the presence of an 227 \nexcess of GRIP-1 would restore cell sensitivity to steroids diminished by cytokine treatment. As 228 \nreported previously (14), treatment of ASM cells with TNF\u03b1\/IFN\u03b3 combination strongly 229 \nsuppressed FP-dependent gene expression as shown by the reduced FP-induced GRE-luciferase 230 \n  \n \n11 \nreporter activity in vector-transfected cells (Figure 3A). This suppression, however, was no 231 \nlonger observed in cells ove-rexpressing GRIP-1 (Figure 3A). Similarly, when steroid 232 \ninsensitivity was induced by over-expressing IRF-1, increased levels of GRIP-1 restored GR 233 \nreporter activity in IRF-1-transfected cells (Figure 3B). Of note, GRIP-1 over-expression 234 \ndramatically and efficiently increased GRIP-1 protein contents (by 2.2 fold, data not shown). 235 \nThese findings suggest that inflammatory cytokines promote GC insensitivity via activation of 236 \nIRF-1 that associates GRIP-1 and sequesters GRIP-1 away from GR. This represents a potential 237 \nmolecular mechanism underlying steroid insensitivity induced by inflammatory cytokines. 238 \nWhether GRIP-1 acts directly or indirectly through the recruitment of additional co-regulators to 239 \novercome IRF-1 regulation of GR signaling needs further investigation. Further, since GRIP-1 240 \ndepletion inhibits only partially FP-transactivation activities (Figure 1C, 1D), additional studies 241 \nare also needed to examine the possible redundant and\/or overlapping functions of other SRC 242 \nfamily members and specifically define whether other p160 co-factors drive GR transcription 243 \nand whether such pathways contribute to the anti-inflammatory actions of GCs in ASM cells. 244 \nImportantly, while the expression of IRF-1 has been demonstrated in the airway epithelium of 245 \nasthmatics (Sampath D et al J Clin Invest. 1999 May;103(9):1353-61), no study has yet 246 \ninvestigated whether the expression of IRF-1 or GRIP-1 is present in CS resistant asthmatics this 247 \nwill be the focus of our future investigations.  248 \nConclusion: This study reveals a potential mechanism for the mutual antagonism 249 \nobserved between IRF-1 and GR in their ability to activate gene transcription. As a shared co-250 \nfactor required for maximal gene activation by both transcription factors, limiting the amount of 251 \nGRIP-1 available to GR in the presence of high level of IRF-1 would dramatically affect GC 252 \nfunction. Our study also shows that the induction of anti-inflammatory proteins such as MKP-1 253 \n  \n \n12 \nby GCs represents a GRIP-1-dependent response. In inflammatory diseases such as asthma 254 \nwhere structural cells such as ASM are exposed to multiple pro-inflammatory factors, an 255 \nabnormal increase in IRF-1 levels would not only lead to increased IRF-1-dependent 256 \ninflammatory proteins but would also impair tissue steroid responsiveness by decreasing GC 257 \nfunction.  258 \n 259 \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS 260 \nThe authors thank Su Gu for his excellent technical assistance and Mary McNichol for 261 \nassistance in the preparation of the manuscript.  262 \n 263 \nREFERENCES 264 \n1.

A, in steroid sensitive conditions where GCs increase the expression of protein MKP-1 to 405 \nexert its anti-inflammatory action, GRIP-1 recruitment to GR on GRE sites of MKP-1 promoter 406 \nis required as a part of GR activation complex. B, in steroid resistant conditions the impairment 407 \nof GCs action by cytokine treatment is due to the fact that GRIP-1 is depleted from GR complex 408 \ndue to its recruitment on IRF-1 binding sites that leads not only and reduced GC action  but also 409 \n  \n \n19 \nto increased expression of the pro-inflammatory protein such as CD38.  We therefore propose a 410 \nmodel where cell sensitivity to GC is determined by the balance between IRF-1 and GR levels 411 \nwhich both compete for the cofactor  GRIP-1 that is essential for their transcriptional activities. 412 \nGC, glucocorticoid; GRE: glucocorticoid responsive elements; GR: glucocorticoid receptor.   413 \n 414 \n  415 \n  \n \n20 \n 416 \n 417 \n  \n \n21 \n 418 \n \n"}
