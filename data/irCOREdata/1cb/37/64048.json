The success of \nwater supply boreholes depends largely on the number, length, dilation and \ninterconnectivity of fractures encountered on drilling. At best, boreholes are capable \nof yields of up to approximately 20 m3\/day; in the worst cases where no suitable \nfractures are encountered, boreholes are dry. Boreholes in Precambrian rocks are \ntherefore typically suitable for domestic or small farm supplies, where yields of 1 to \n10 m3\/day are sufficient, but not for larger supplies. MacDonald et al. (2005) estimate \nthat there are more than 20 000 springs, wells and boreholes used for private water \nsupply in Scotland, most of which are in remote rural areas, often in the Highlands, \ntapping Precambrian basement aquifers. However, until recently, most public water \nsupply boreholes in the Highlands tapped high-yielding sand and gravel aquifers in \nmajor river valleys.  \n \nIn 2004, Scottish Water, looking to improve public water supplies to a number of \nscattered, small Highlands communities, investigated the further development of \ngroundwater supplies from Precambrian metamorphic and highly indurated \nsedimentary rock aquifers in the Highlands. Supplies of up to 45 m3\/day were \nrequired for each community, each of which is located in areas where high \npermeability superficial aquifers are absent or are unsuitable for public water supply, \nfor example because of poor water quality. Local groundwater development was \npreferable to the further development of surface water resources, for reasons both of \ncost and the environmental sensitivity of these remote areas. Hydrofracturing was \nJ Cobbing and B \u00c9 \u00d3 Dochartaigh  6 \n  \nidentified as a technique with the potential to improve the normal expected borehole \nyields to the required level. This note describes data from two boreholes, where \ndetailed testing before and after hydrofracturing allowed yield increases of more than \none order of magnitude, attributable to hydrofracturing, to be quantified.  \n \nTrial boreholes \n \nThe two trial boreholes are at separate sites in the Scottish Highlands: Alligin in \nWester Ross, and Laggan Bridge in Invernessshire (Figure 1). The approximate public \nwater demand at Alligin is 45 m3\/day, and at Laggan Bridge is 25 m3\/day. Borehole \nsiting was governed by logistical, land ownership, and hydrogeological factors. The \nAlligin borehole was drilled by Drilcorp Ltd, and the Laggan Bridge borehole by \nRaeburn Drilling and Geotechnical Ltd. Both boreholes were hydrofractured by \nDrilcorp Ltd. At each site, BGS hydrogeologists supervised the borehole drilling, \ntesting and hydrofracturing on behalf of Scottish Water Solutions. Borehole details \nare summarised in Table 1.  \nJ Cobbing and B \u00c9 \u00d3 Dochartaigh  7 \n  \n \nFigure 1  Locations of Alligin and Laggan Bridge boreholes and the extent of \nlow and very low productivity aquifers in Scotland, as classified by BGS (MacDonald \net al. 2004)\nJ Cobbing and B \u00c9 \u00d3 Dochartaigh  8 \n  \n \nBorehole  Easting Northing Depth \n(m) \nDepth of \nsurface \ncasing \n(m) \nDiameter \n(mm) \nBedrock geology \nAlligin 183158 858246 83.5 8 200 \nApplecross \nFormation \n(sandstone) to \n79.8 m; Scourian \nGneisses from \n79.8 \u2013 83.5 m \nLaggan \nBridge \n261092 794349 100 34 200 \nGrampian Group \n(gneissose \npsammites and \nsemipelites) \n \nTable 1  Summary of boreholes at Alligin and Laggan Bridge \n \nHydrofracturing   \n \nBackground \nHydrofracturing of new and existing water boreholes to increase yields is routinely \ncarried out in the United States, and has also been used successfully in other parts of \nthe world, including Scandinavia, South Africa, India, and Australia. \n \nJ Cobbing and B \u00c9 \u00d3 Dochartaigh  9 \n  \nThe technique acts to enhance borehole yields, by injecting high-pressure water into a \nborehole in order to create and enlarge fractures in the surrounding rock. \nHydrofracturing also acts as a borehole development technique, clearing loose \nsediment from existing fractures. It does not increase the storativity of the aquifer, but \neffectively widens the influence of the borehole so that it draws from a greater area of \nstorage. The pressure required to create new fractures, and the degree of yield \nimprovement, varies considerably according to rock tensile strength and stresses and \npermeability, and on the initial yield of the borehole (Less 1994, Less and Anderson \n1994, Schuring 2002, Ramsted 2004). Various studies report that minimum yield \nincreases of 20 % and average increases of at least 80 % are achieved in between 40 \nand 70 % of hydrofractured boreholes, with the largest improvements seen in rock \nformations with lower initial permeability, particularly crystalline rocks (Joshi 1996, \nLess 1994, Less and Anderson 1994, Herbert et al. 1993, Shuring 2002). Where \nboreholes are dry prior to hydrofracturing, they typically show little or no \nimprovement (Joshi 1996). Studies have also concluded that improving borehole \nyields by hydrofracturing is more cost-effective than drilling new boreholes (Joshi \n1996, Less and Andersen 1994, Talbot et al. 1993).  \n \nTechnique  \nHydrofracturing is carried out in the open, uncased section of a borehole, below the \ncasing and the water table. The interval to be hydrofractured is hydraulically isolated \nusing packers: a single packer is used to isolate the hole below the packer, or two \npackers used to isolate a discrete interval, typically a known fracture horizon. Water is \npumped through the centre of the top packer into the zone to be hydrofractured. The \npressure within the packered interval until a level is reached at which fractures in the \nJ Cobbing and B \u00c9 \u00d3 Dochartaigh  10 \n  \nsurrounding rock are enlarged, or new fractures are created. This pressure varies, from \napproximately 35 bar in softer rocks, to over 140 bar in harder rocks (Ramsted 2004). \nFracture opening causes a drop in the injected water pressure, and increased flow of \nwater into the rock. Pumping of water into the packered interval then continues to \ndevelop the fractures, at rates of up to approximately 300 litres\/minute. After \nhydrofracturing, the injected water is normally pumped or airlifted from the borehole, \ntogether with any debris arising from the process. Caliper logging is often carried out \nprior to hydrofracturing, and other downhole geophysical logging or television \nsurveys may also be run, both to determine fractured zones which might be enhanced \nby the technique, and to locate suitable positions on the borehole walls where the \npackers might be placed for optimal sealing. Hydrofracturing can also affect nearby \nboreholes, as evidenced by rising water levels (e.g. \u00d3 Dochartaigh et al. 2005). Solids \nsuch as glass beads or sand can be added to the injected fluid as propping agents or \n\u2018proppants\u2019 to keep open newly developed fractures, but studies have shown that they \ndo not always increase the effectiveness of the technique (e.g. Ramsted 2004). \n \nScottish trials \n \nA single packer system designed by Drilcorp Ltd was used on both trial boreholes. \nThe packer (Figure 2) was placed initially near the top of the borehole, but a few \nmetres below the base of the casing in order to prevent damage to the casing seal. It \nwas expanded by means of a single acting hydraulic ram controlled at the surface by a \nhand-operated pump, typically to a pressure of around 415 bar. The hydraulic oil used \nto expand the packer via the ram was biodegradable in case of leaks, and was pumped \nto the packer via a high-pressure hydraulic hose. A steel release cable was attached to \nJ Cobbing and B \u00c9 \u00d3 Dochartaigh  11 \n  \nthe top of the packer, so that in the event of the packer failing to contract when the \nhydraulic oil pressure was released, it could be used to force the packer to contract. \nPotable water was then pumped through the steel pipe and packer and into the interval \nto be pressurised. The high-pressure water pump consisted of a diesel motor \nconnected via a gearbox to a triplex pump capable of 240 m3\/day at 140 bar. The \nvolume and pressure of water from the pump to the packered interval was controlled \nusing a system incorporating two pressure gauges, two non-return valves and three \ngate valves mounted on a steel trestle, which allowed the pressure of the water to the \npackered interval to be closely controlled (Figure 3). Once a fracture or set of \nfractures had been developed, and the pressure had dropped, the packer was \ncontracted and lowered below those fractures to pressurise another unfractured section \nof the borehole. New fractures can only be developed below existing fractures using \nthe single packer system.    \nJ Cobbing and B \u00c9 \u00d3 Dochartaigh  12 \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2 Schematic of the packer used for hydrofracturing \n \nHigh-pressure water in \nRelease cable \nSingle acting hydraulic ram \nHydraulic oil for expanding packer \nRubber packer \nJ Cobbing and B \u00c9 \u00d3 Dochartaigh  13 \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3 Schematic of the hydrofracture system \n \nThe system incorporates two pressure gauges, two non-return valves and three gate valves. \nThe first pressure gauge monitors the pump output pressure (1), which can be reduced by gate \nvalves (A and B), allowing some water to return to the water store (2) if necessary. The water \nthen flows through a non-return valve to the borehole (5). A second pressure gauge, mounted \nafter the non-return valve, monitors the water pressure in the borehole. Provision for the \ninjection of further high-pressure water from the drilling rig pump is made via a second non-\nreturn valve (3). The system was equipped with a pressure release port (4) controlled by a \ngate valve (C), allowing the water pressure to be released at the end of the procedure.\nA \n5 \n4 3 \n2\n1 \nB \nC \n1.

A \nsummary of the runs is given in Table 2. In each case, the maximum pressure was \nreached only a few minutes into the run, with the pressure tending to increase as a \nseries of sharp \u2018kicks\u2019 rather than as a steady increase. The maximum pressure varied \nfrom 35 to more than 120 bar, but was most often between 50 and 70 bar. After \nreaching the maximum in each run, the pressure dropped, generally to between 17 and \n35 bar, and maintained at this level as more water was pumped in. This pattern is \ninterpreted as the creation, widening or clearing out or more fractures at the highest \npressure, which then form an outlet for the water being pumped in, thus limiting the \npressure which can be maintained beneath the packer. The nature and extent of \nbedrock permeability is the major control on the pressures that can be achieved during \nhydrofracturing, although a higher pressure pump with a larger flow capacity may be \nable to raise the maximum and holding pressure further. \n \nBorehole  Number of \nhydrofracture \nruns \nDepth \nrange of \npacker \n(m) \nMaximum \npressure \nachieved \n(bar) \nAverage \nsteady \npressure \n(bar) \nTotal volume \nwater \ninjected (m3) \nAlligin 4 13 \u2013 58 120 35 5.7 \nLaggan Bridge 4 40 \u2013 85 70 17 7 \n  \nTable 2 Summary of hydrofracturing on boreholes at Alligin and Laggan Bridge \n \nJ Cobbing and B \u00c9 \u00d3 Dochartaigh  15 \n  \nHydraulic testing \n \nRising head tests were carried out on both boreholes before and after hydrofracturing. \nFor both boreholes, post-hydrofracturing tests were carried out at significantly higher \nflow rates (Table 3). The test results were analysed to estimate transmissivity for the \nsurrounding aquifers, using the software package BGSPT (Barker and Macdonald \n2000, Barker 1985) (Figure 4). The transmissivity of both boreholes increased \nsignificantly, by more than one order of magnitude, following hydrofracturing (Table \n3), from 0.03 to 0.6 m2 day-1 at Alligin and from 0.16 to 2.2 m2 day-1 at Laggan \nBridge. The linear response of water levels in both boreholes before hydrofracturing \n(Figure 4) points to fracture dewatering and the cascading of water down the \nboreholes, even at the very low test yields. By comparison, the noticeably different \nnon-linear water level response following hydrofracturing indicates radial flow to the \nboreholes and no fracture dewatering, even at the significantly higher test yields.  \n \n Pre-hydrofracturing Post-hydrofracturing \nBorehole  Yield (l\/min) Transmissivity  \n(m2\/day) \nYield (l\/min) Transmissivity  \n(m2\/day) \nAlligin > 5 0.03 35 \u2013 40 0.6 \nLaggan Bridge negligible 0.16 18 2.19 \n \nTable 3  Summary of hydraulic test results on boreholes at Alligin and Laggan Bridge \n \nJ Cobbing and B \u00c9 \u00d3 Dochartaigh  16 \n  \n \nFigure 4 Time-drawdown curves for modelled and observed data for (i) pre- and (ii) \npost-hydrofracture rising head tests at Alligin, and (iii) pre- and (iv) post-hydrofracture rising \nhead tests at Laggan Bridge.  \nA close agreement between modelled and observed drawdown allows high confidence \nin estimated transmissivity. \n \nJ Cobbing and B \u00c9 \u00d3 Dochartaigh  17 \n  \nConclusions \n \nHydrofracturing has increased the yields of two boreholes in Precambrian aquifers in \nScotland by at least one order of magnitude, in line with reported results from \nhydrofracturing in similar aquifers elsewhere in the world. Based on these data, it is \nnot obvious if the main yield increase is due to the increased pressure during \nhydrofracturing creating new fractures or expanding existing ones, or to a process of \nborehole development as loose debris or clay is cleared from existing fractures. It is \nlikely that a combination of these factors is in operation. Pumped flow-logging of \nboreholes before and after hydrofracturing would be a useful tool in determining \nwhere new inflow zones might typically be located. Follow-up testing of boreholes \nwould show if the yield increases produced by hydrofracturing are maintained over \nthe long term.  \n \nYield increases following hydrofracturing of boreholes in Precambrian aquifers in \nScotland are sufficient to allow the development of groundwater for public water \nsupply, albeit on a small-scale. Hydrofracturing is cheaper than re-drilling to replace \nlow yielding boreholes, particularly when the new boreholes are in any case likely to \nbe equally low yielding. This has important implications for the continued \ndevelopment of groundwater in remote rural areas in Scotland, and other parts of the \nUnited Kingdom, where existing surface water supplies often require extensive, \nexpensive and environmentally detrimental water transport and treatment. \n \nHydrofracturing is not a replacement for informed borehole siting to maximise the \nchances of obtaining the required yield, but provides a useful additional tool for the \nhydrogeologist working in hard rock, low productivity terrains. Although such areas \nJ Cobbing and B \u00c9 \u00d3 Dochartaigh  18 \n  \nhave often been considered in Africa and other parts of the developing world as part \nof small scale rural water supplies, the evidence presented here and in other recent \nstudies in areas such as Scandinavia (Ramstad 2004) indicates that the technique may \nhave more wider application in the United Kingdom. Examples of other areas suitable \nfor hydrofracturing may include Palaeozoic indurated sedimentary rocks in the \nScottish Borders, the Lake District and Wales, and granites and lavas in Scotland, \nNorthern Ireland and Cornwall. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis work was carried out as part of projects funded by Scottish Water.
