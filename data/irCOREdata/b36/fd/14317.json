Although there has been some contact,\nin the main this has been partial and intermittent. For first-year students, one consequence\nof this state of affairs has been the absence of a systematic and co-ordinated strategy for\nenabling them to acquire, practise and develop information-gathering skills. Teaching staff\nhave seen their role in this respect mainly in terms of issuing students with reading lists\ncontaining a mix of books and journal articles, and underlying this approach is the\nexpectation that information specialists will be on hand to provide whatever additional\nhelp is needed to access these resources, for example through the provision of introductory\ntalks and one-to-one support sessions. Relatively few teaching staff have incorporated\nlibrary exercises into their teaching and assessment, or adopted a more creative approach\nto information gathering by students, such as helping them use bibliographic and other\naids to prepare personalized reading lists. Consequently, when students have been required\n31\nRoger Ottewill and A\/ison Hudson Electronic information resource use: implications for teaching and library staff\nto do this at later stages of their studies, especially in the context of preparing a\ndissertation, they have not been adequately prepared, and often find it extremely difficult\nto access and evaluate information resources effectively.\nSuch deficiencies have been compounded by major changes in the information and\nlearning and teaching environments. Of particular importance in this respect are the rapid\nexpansion of electronic information resources and the moves towards seeing students as\nindependent learners. There is now a perceived need on the part of an increasing number of\nteaching staff and of information specialists for a more carefully planned approach to the\nintroduction of students to information gathering.\nIn this paper, we shall:\n\u2022 outline the key features of the changing environment within which students are\nexpected to develop their information gathering skills;\n\u2022 report on a small action research project undertaken by a team of teaching staff and\ninformation specialists at Sheffield Hallam University (SHU) and designed to examine\nsome of the issues concerning the effective use of electronic information resources by\nstudents;\n\u2022 highlight a number of the lessons learned from the project; and\n\u2022 set an agenda for further research in this area.\nThe changing environment\nIn recent years, a number of technological developments have radically changed the\navailability of information, and this has had a significant impact on students and teaching\nstaff, and on information specialists struggling to support them.\nInformation that was previously only accessible on remote, complex and prohibitively\nexpensive online systems has become accessible locally on CD-ROM databases. CD-ROM\nsearch interfaces have become relatively easy to exploit. Familiarization time with key\nfunctions has been significantly reduced. User documentation has shrunk from multi-\nvolume online manuals to simple user guides consisting of only a few pages. Databases\nwhich in their online form required several days of training to access effectively can now be\nsearched by new users after a relatively limited amount of training. The increase in access\nhas presented new skills-related problems concerning the effectiveness of searching, and -\nironically - many services are easier to use ineffectively than expertly. In addition, students\nand teaching staff now face the problem of balancing quality with the quantity of\ninformation retrieved.\nThe costs of electronic information resources have fallen dramatically in the past ten years.\nHardware and software costs have declined. The use of local CD-ROM storage as opposed\nto online access has removed the very expensive and unmanageable online communication\ncosts. The removal of access limits associated with communication charges has allowed\ninformation providers to give unlimited access to services which had in the past been\nprohibitively expensive. For example, a standard US bibliographic database accessed\nonline could cost the provider about \u00a360 per hour to access and obtain references. The CD-\nROM version has no such costs attached to the intensity of usage or volume of data\n32\nALT-J Volume 5 Number 2\nretrieved. Moreover, national agreements between manufacturers and higher-education\ninstitutions are making available in an electronic format a considerable quantity of\nteaching and research material that could not otherwise be afforded.\nDevelopments in CD-ROM networking have allowed multiple and simultaneous access to\nthe same data. In 1990, only two operational networks were installed in the UK university\nsector (Akeroyd et al, 1990). A survey in 1993 identified a substantial increase in the\nnumber of operational installations, with approximately 20 institutions running networked\nCD-ROMs. Of these, 75 per cent had plans to expand substantially in the near future\n(Ward, 1994). The continuing expansion is confirmed by a recent survey of CD-ROM\nacquisition by British Universities carried out by the Database Research Resources Group\nat City University. The initial findings show that there was a 36 per cent increase in\nexpenditure on CD-ROM acquisition between 1993\/94 and 1994\/95. In short, the\nmounting of CD-ROMs on networks has become an increasingly attractive option to\ninformation specialists facing the spiralling and geographically dispersed student numbers\nof the 1990s.\nThese changes have resulted in a fundamental shift in how information is accessed and by\nwhom. The role of the information specialist as a provider of mediated online searching\nhas shifted to that of supporting and training users who access resources directly.\nSpecifically, students now require guidance on effective searching and balancing the\npotentially unlimited quantity of information with quality and time constraints. Such\nguidance is of increasing importance with the moves towards greater student centredness\nin the delivery of courses and other changes in the learning and teaching environment.\nThis is presenting information specialists with new challenges as they seek to help students\nexploit the potential of electronic information resources.\nFirst, there is the challenge arising from the fact that students are being given greater\nfreedom regarding what they study and where they work. Formal classroom contact hours\nare decreasing, and students' self-managed study time is increasing. This shift to student-\ncentred, independent learning has resulted in a requirement for a much more diverse pool\nof relevant information, a greater need for personal support from information specialists,\nand the need for students to develop new skills to enable them to retrieve and utilize data\nfrom a complex and vast selection of database services.\nSecond, despite the increasing availability of electronic information resources, many\nteaching staff continue to place a heavy reliance on recommending traditional library\nsupport material, particularly text books. Thus, there is a growing mismatch between\nso-called 'core' material cited on reading lists and the actual information required for\nstudents' assessed work. This raises some fundamental questions relating to liaison\nbetween information specialists and teaching staff and the relative emphasis in library\nspending on different types of material. The challenge is heightened by the fact that there is\nstill a very poor awareness among teaching staff of the potential of electronic information\nresources and of access problems facing their students, and teaching staff are often\nunaware of the resources available to students for the work they have set. This is\nparticularly worrying in situations where teachers are formally required to assess the ability\nof students to use these resources. A case could be made for arguing that information\nspecialists should play a large part in raising the awareness of teaching staff as to what is\n33\nRoger OtLewill and Alison Hudson Electronic information resource use: implications for teaching and library staff\navailable and, more radically, should contribute to the design of assignments and then-\nassessment.\nThird, many students are unaware of the large number of complex electronic information\nresources now available via library and information services. Some students discover\nappropriate resources in an ad hoc manner, not necessarily at the most timely moment for\ntheir work. Others remain in complete ignorance of their availability. The provision of\nappropriate and timely support and guidance is therefore a key challenge.\nFourth, there is an increasing emphasis on information gathering and retrieval as an essential\ntransferable skill which students are expected to acquire as part of their studies. For example,\n'use information sources' is one of the 18 common skill outcomes identified by BTEC; the\ncore skills framework developed within SHU includes 'information gathering'; and there is\nan emphasis on information retrieval skills within NVQ competencies.\nLast, there are considerable variations of computer literacy among students. Many are\ncomputer literate prior to entering higher education, a result of increasing exposure to\ntechnology in the home, school and social environments, and many mature students have\ncomputer skills learned in industry. However, some students, both from traditional school-\nleaver intakes and from mature entry routes, still have no computing skills when they\narrive. Thus, there is a need to level the playing field with regard to basic computer literacy\nprior to exposing students to electronic information resources, especially when their\ncompetence in this field is to be assessed.\nThese related challenges highlight the critical need for improved liaison between the\nproviders and users of electronic information resources. They also emphasize the need to\naddress the skills requirement of students and the increased contribution which\ninformation specialists might make to the teaching of related areas, such as information\ntechnology and statistics.\nFor SHU, the need to find an appropriate response is particularly pressing, since at the\ntime of writing (Summer 1996) it is about to open a new Learning Centre, an initiative that\nhas been prompted, in part, by the gathering pace of technological change and the\nincreasing emphasis on skill development and resource-based, independent learning. It was\nagainst this background that a group of SHU staff decided to undertake a small action\nresearch project designed to explore some of the issues surrounding the impact of\nelectronic information resource developments on the student experience, and the roles and\nresponsibilities of teaching staff and library-based information specialists. Such a project\nwas very much in line with Raddon's call for more joint research in this area that is\n'innovative and imaginative' (1995).\nThe research project\nThe project team comprised two members of the teaching staff and three information\nspecialists, who shared the view that the increasing availability of electronic information\nresources had significant implications for students and staff alike. The aims of the project\nwere to determine how best to facilitate the effective use of electronic information\nresources by students and staff, and to identify those issues concerning relations between\nteaching staff and information specialists requiring further investigation. In pursuing these\n34\nALT-] Volume 5 Number 2\naims, the team worked together on the design and administration of a library exercise\ninvolving the use of electronic and paper-based information resources, the training and\nassessment of the students who undertook the exercise, and the monitoring and\nsubsequent evaluation of the experience of collaborating in this way.\nThe students who served as the focus of the project were those studying European\nintegration on the first year of the BTEC Public Administration\/Business and Finance\nProgramme in the Business School of SHU. They were selected because:\n\u2022 skill development is given a high priority on BTEC programmes;\n\u2022 the subject area - the European Union - is a field where the information resources\navailable are both complex and dynamic, with the material being organized according\nto non-standard referencing systems and often in several languages;\nFigure l:The library exercise in te\npedagogic context\nLearning outcomes for the assignment\nI\nAssignment design\n\u2022 outcomes\n\u2022 task specification\n\u2022 information requirements\n\u2022 assessment criteria\nI\nAssignment briefing\nI\nLibrary exercise\nDiagnosis\nTraining\nUndertaking exercise\nAssessing performance\nFeedback and debriefing\nI\nFurther information gathering\nI.\nFiltering and analysis of\nmaterial collected\n1\nPreparation of assignment\nI\nAssessment of assignment\nI\nFeedback on assignment\n35\nRoger Ottewill and Alison Hudson Electronic information resource use: implications for teaching and library staff\n\u2022 the subject tutor expected them to keep up to date with developments in a rapidly\nchanging and controversial field;\n\u2022 the total number taking the unit was relatively small (15), which made the project easier\nto manage;\n\u2022 a second-semester unit fitted better with the timetable for the project; and\n\u2022 the subject tutor and her line manager were both members of the project team.\nDespite some of the distinctive features of European integration, the team felt that any\nlessons learned from the project would be equally relevant for other subject areas.\nIn designing the library exercise, care was taken to ensure that it would contribute to the\ncompletion of a formally assessed assignment. The link between the exercise and the\nassignment is shown in Figure 1. As can be seen, the learning outcomes being tested\nthrough the assignment served as the starting point. Of these, the most relevant for the\nexercise was the ability of students 'to undertake specialist studies of the impact of the\nSingle Market on specific sectors'. In skill-development terms, this implied being able to\nselect and access relevant sources of information. As the figure makes clear, following the\nexercise the students were expected to gather additional information prior to the\npreparation and submission of their assignments for assessment and feedback. In other\nwords, the exercise was but one small part of the total assignment experience. Nonetheless,\nit alerted students to the range and variety of electronic and other information resources\nand to their means of access.\nThe exercise consisted of a set of questions with precise answers, and focused on both\nEuropean Documentation Collection (EDC) and non-EDC resources. Decisions on which\nresources to use were taken jointly by the subject tutor and appropriate information\nspecialist. The majority were computerized databases containing abstracts, references and,\nin some cases, articles. However, a few were paper-based and could be found in the OPAC\nlibrary catalogue. The databases were ECInfodisk, Hansard on CD-ROM, The Guardian on\nCD-ROM, The Economist on CD-ROM, The Financial Times on CD-ROM, ABI Inform\nand OPAC. Some resources provided students with the required data on screen, and others\nprovided information which referred them to printed collections. They included a mixture\nof stand-alone and networked services. Although predominantly CD-ROM based, the\nlibrary online catalogue was also a key resource. All the resources were regarded as\nimportant not only for the library exercise but also for European integration in general.\nThe majority were accessible on a number of networked terminals, with the exception of\nEC Infodisk and Hansard. All the databases were relatively simple and user-friendly, with\nthe possible exception of the EC Infodisk. The downloading procedures for the Guardian\nCD was also quite complicated for novice users since it had a more difficult search\ninterface than the others. However, all the services were menu-driven and contained\nqn-screen help. And with the exception of the library catalogue, all the resources had\nprinted documentation adjacent to the terminals. More complex online systems were\nexcluded due to limits on access and considerably greater training requirements.\nThe exercise was intended to be completed in a maximum of two and a half hours. The\nquestions were piloted on members of the project team to ensure that they could be\nanswered in the time available. The students, were all given the same questions to complete\n36\nALT-] Volume 5 Number 2\nto facilitate comparison. This meant that there could be collaboration and even copying.\nHowever, students inevitably share information and direct one another to appropriate\nresources, so this situation was realistic.\nPrior to undertaking the exercise, the link between the learning outcomes, the assignment -\nin terms of both the skills and knowledge requirements - and the library exercise was\nexplained to students. The value of completing such an exercise, and the importance of the\nassignment in developing their understanding of European integration, were also stressed.\nEach student was then interviewed to assess his\/her previous computing experience (degree\nof computer literacy) and his\/her ability to use electronic media in a library environment.\nClearly, the prior knowledge and experience students bring to an exercise of this nature is\nextremely varied. It is also very difficult to measure. Nonetheless, an attempt was made to\nquantify their computer literacy and familiarity with electronic information resources on a\nscale of 1 to 5.\nThe next step was to divide the students at random into two groups. One, the privileged\ngroup, was given training prior to carrying out the exercise; the other, the control group,\nwas given training after the exercise. In this way, it was hoped to compare the relative\nperformance of each group in carrying out the exercise and thereby assess the validity of\nthe assumption that their success or failure in using electronic and other information\nresources would be affected by the timing of their training. This took the form of a 90-\nminute classroom session led by one of the information specialists in the team. It\nincorporated the following elements:\n\u2022 a detailed handout listing and describing databases of relevance to those studying\nEuropean integration;\n\u2022 a 30-minute computer presentation on the databases, their coverage, location, how to\naccess them and how to print and download data; and\n\u2022 a 60-minute demonstration of the systems required for the library exercise, including\nworked search examples and data output (the worked examples were similar but not\nidentical to the actual data required in the exercise).\nThus, the training covered both general information-gathering skills and data-specific\nones. The former included awareness raising and coverage of relevant resources, the\nlocation and role of the help desk, finding and accessing resources, search skills (for\nexample, how to narrow down and select items), printing and downloading to disk, and\nusing printing facilities in the library. The latter included understanding library\nclassification sequences in the EDC and the general book collection* the nature of\ninformation in the EDC (specifically the Official Journal), and how to relate references to\ncited material. The training did not include hands-on exercises and was not as interactive\nas it might have been. In retrospect, one of the weaknesses of this part of the project was\nthe failure to involve the subject tutor as well as the information specialist in the design and\ndelivery of the training session. . \u2022\nThe exercise took place between 10.15 am and 12.45 pm, a time when the library is usually\nat its busiest. During the exercise the students were observed by the member of the project\nteam who had previously interviewed them and someone they did not know. The former\nalso dealt with many of the questions the students asked, keeping a note of them and the\n37\nRoger Ottewill and Alison Hudson Electronic information resource use: implications for teaching and library staff\nanswers she gave. Very few of the students made use of the services of the help desk: not\nsurprisingly, they felt more comfortable approaching someone they knew.\nThe situation was not entirely realistic in a number of respects. Some of networked machines\nhad been pre-booked for the students to use. This would not happen in reality; but was done\non this occasion to ensure that as many of the students as possible completed the exercise in\nthe two and a half hours allocated. The students had access to the total attention of a\nminimum of one librarian for the whole of the two-hour session - a desirable situation from\nthe students' point of view, but again not currently realistic from a staffing point of view.\nHowever, despite pre-booking machines, there was still limited access to the databases, and\ngiven that there are several databases on each stand-alone machine, only one database could\nbe used at any one time. Furthermore, because of the limited amount of time allowed for the\nexercise, the students had to work in twos and threes at the workstations, which led to a\ncertain amount of sharing of information.\nA record was kept of how long it took each student to complete the exercise as well as\nhis\/her mark. The students were individually interviewed for a second time, prior to the\ncontrol-group students receiving retrospective training. The purpose of this second\ninterview was to debrief the students and to act as a feedback session in relation to the\nexercise and training. The questions in the debriefing interviews were designed to\nencourage student reflection on their training and the effect it had had on their\nperformance in carrying out the exercise. During the debriefing process, the computer\nliteracy of each student was reassessed.\nAlthough the number of students involved was relatively small and the results were not\nstatistically significant, several interesting observations can be made. These are\nsummarized as follows:\n\u2022 members of the privileged group achieved, on average, higher marks for the exercise\nthan members of the control group;\n\u2022 members of the privileged group finished the exercise, on average, earlier than members\nof the control group;\n\u2022 students who achieved the highest marks also tended to have the higher computer\nliteracy levels as assessed at the first interview; and\n\u2022 there was an increase in computer literacy levels for members of both groups, but with\na much higher overall increase for those in the privileged group.\nMembers of both groups agreed that the training had been beneficial with respect to\nimprovements in their search techniques; helping them identify and access the correct\nresource; saving time in completing the exercise; and increasing their confidence.\nFrom the point of view of the team, the project was felt to be a useful learning experience.\nIt helped to clarify the nature of the differing perspectives of teaching staff and\ninformation specialists; to demonstrate the scale of the investment in terms of time, if\ntraining and exercises and assignments are to be jointly planned and delivered; and to\nhighlight the practical problems involved in carrying out research in this area. More\nspecifically, it threw up some important lessons for information specialists and teaching\nstaff.\n38\nAa-J Volume 5 Number 2\nThe lessons\nArguably, the most important lesson was that if the enhancement of students' information-\ngathering skills, particularly with respect to the effective use of electronic information\nresources, is to be taken seriously, collaboration between teaching staff and information\nspecialists is essential. What this means in practice is that both must support each other in\nthe monitoring of developments in the sphere of electronic information resources, the\ntraining of students, and the setting and assessment of exercises and assignments.\nWith respect to the monitoring of developments, information specialists need to pay\nconstant attention to finding effective ways of familiarizing and updating teaching staff on\nwhat is happening. This means being sensitive to the other pressures on teaching staff but,\nat the same time, getting over the message that they are in danger of not being able to guide\ntheir students as fully as they might if they ignore, or do not keep up with, technological\ndevelopments in the sphere of information gathering. Teaching staff need to respond to\nhelp and support from information specialists by enriching their reading lists through the\naddition of electronic information resources, especially where it is intended that students\nshould use these for assignment purposes. In other words, careful attention must be given\nto the shaping of student expectations with respect to the information resources they will\nbe expected to utilize while studying a particular unit.\nAnother lesson is that training sessions for students need to be planned jointly, to ensure\nthat both the timing and content are right. For training to be successful it has to be\nprovided at a time when it will have maximum impact as far as the meeting of assignment\ndeadlines is concerned. There also need to be direct and explicit links between the training\nand the information requirements of assignments. Thus, decisions on the resources to be\ncovered in the session have to be made on a collaborative basis and take into account\nfactors such as their relevance, their user-friendliness relative to their value in information\nterms, and their availability. In addition, training ought be undertaken during a regular\nclass session in order to symbolize the integrated nature of the assignment\/project and to\novercome the problems associated with finding an alternative day\/time when all the\nstudents are available. Ideally, training sessions ought to be team-taught and, wherever\npossible, they should be based on student-centred, hands-on, interactive delivery methods,\nand incorporate library exercises. Only in this way are students with a relatively low level of\ncomputer literacy likely to build up the confidence they require in order to be able to use\nthe resources with little or no further assistance.\nIt is also important to recognize the consequences of the raised student expectations\narising from their training. These are likely to include:\n\u2022 increased demands for access to electronic information resources;\n\u2022 requests for additional help from information specialists, especially those involved in\nthe training; and\n\u2022 queries about the availability of resources not covered by the training.\nConsideration needs to be given, too, to the possibility of guaranteeing access to terminals\nat particular times for groups of students undertaking a particular project.\nLike the training, assignments requiring access to, and the use of, electronic information\n_\nRoger OttewiM and Alison Hudson Electronic information resource use implications for teaching and library staff\nresources need to be designed on a collaborative basis. Only in this way can teaching staff\nbe specifically briefed on the availability of resources and the pressures on them from\nstudents and other users. A related lesson is that, on occasions, it might be appropriate for\ninformation specialists to be proactive by providing teaching staff with ideas for\nassignments and projects designed to test the ability of students to utilize electronic\ninformation resources in a competent manner. At the very least, their involvement in\ndrawing up the specification for assignments of this kind is essential. The participation of\ninformation specialists in the assessment of the information\/bibliographic skills aspects of\nassignments is also highly desirable. Clearly, this is likely to affect workloads and would\nhave to be negotiated with teaching staff.\nIn designing assignments, it needs to be recognized that information is not a 'free' resource.\nMoreover, the ability range of students with respect to computer literacy in general, and\nthe use of IT skills in a library context in particular, is likely to vary considerably. Thus, it is\ndesirable to determine their prior knowledge and expertise in this area (that is, to carry out\na diagnostic exercise) before deciding on the precise terms of reference for a piece of\ncoursework.\nUnderlying these lessons is a recognition that the boundary between the support students\nreceive from information specialists and teaching staff is becoming increasingly blurred. It\nis therefore important for both teaching staff and information specialists to see themselves\nas partners in a joint enterprise, namely to facilitate learning. Clearly, this should be\nreflected in the continuing professional development not only of teaching staff but also of\ninformation specialists (Raddon, 1995).\nAn agenda for further research\nThe lessons referred to above also point to areas where further research is required, the\nfirst concerning communication between information specialists and teaching staff. It is\nparticularly important to find the most effective mechanisms for ensuring that teaching\nstaff are kept abreast of developments in the sphere of electronic information resources.\nLinked to this are the expectations teaching staff have of information specialists and vice\nversa, and the problems which can arise when these are not realized.\nA second area involves finding solutions to the logistical problems involved in training very\nlarge numbers of students in the use of electronic information resources and in providing\nthem with appropriate access. While the project described in this paper has demonstrated\nwhat can be achieved with a relatively small number of students, resource constraints make\nit extremely difficult (if not impossible) to adopt similar methods on units being taken\nsimultaneously by 200 or more students.\nThird, research could usefully be undertaken into the relationship between competence in\nthe use of electronic information resources and overall performance in an assignment. In\nother words, to what extent is the diligence with which students undertake the\nbibliographic and information-gathering aspects of an assignment or project, including the\nuse of electronic information resources, reflected in the overall quality of the finished\nproduct? From the project, it is clear that both the way students use electronic information\nresources and their achievement in assignments are affected by a very wide variety of\nfactors. From the grades students received it is not possible to say that those who are\n40\nALT-] Volume 5 Number 2\nconfident on the technology did best in the assignment. Performance depends on a very\ncomplex set of factors. For example, some confident users of the electronic information\nresources were insufficiently analytical of the material they found and did not, therefore,\nperform well in terms of grades. Others were less confident but approached the work\nmethodically and did all that was required of them, thus achieving higher grades.\nA final research area relates to the design of assignments\/projects and the question of how\nto secure an effective balance between, on the one hand, the conceptual and theoretical\nrequirements of an assignment\/project and, on the other, the empirical requirements. The\ninformation explosion has led to many students suffering from information overload and\nthinking that a long list of sources and undigested extracts from them constitutes learning.\nAcknowledgements\nThe research on which this paper is based was funded by SHU's Learning and Teaching\nInstitute.
