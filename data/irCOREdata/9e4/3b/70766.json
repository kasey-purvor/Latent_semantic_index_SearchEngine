English majors in non-native contexts, however, represent a group unlike any of the \nothers. They already have a good command of the language at the beginning of their studies, and \ntheir goals are not tied to any one profession. More often than not, in the first years of their studies, \nthey are given courses in EAP so that they can successfully complete their studies, irrespective of \nthe fact that following graduation very few of them are likely to stay in \u201cacademia\". Majoring in \nEnglish in a non-native context is usually a prerequisite for becoming a teacher of the language, and \nit is also a passport to becoming an \u2018authority' in it.  As a consequence, the language needs of \nEnglish majors in non-native contexts are often given little thought under the tacit assumption that \nthey have to know everything anyway.  These students may not be taught English for business, but \nthey might end up having to teach it, and they may not have dealt with English for science, but they \nmay land in a job where they edit or translate science articles. \nMackay (1965) pointed out that since it is impossible to teach the whole of a language, all \nmethods must select the part of it that they intend to teach. When designing courses or exams for \nEnglish major students it is necessary that the English department have reliable information on the \nlanguage use of these students during and after their studies so that what is taught and what is tested \nmatches their needs as closely as possible. \nIt was the realisation of this necessity that led to the design of a needs analysis survey as part \nof a large-scale test-design project at the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University, Budapest. The investigation \nfocused on the global level (Tarone & Yule, 1989), namely on \u201cthe situations in which learners will \nneed to use the language and language related activities which typically occur in those situations\" \n 4 \n(p. 37).  The results of the investigation are being used in the re-structuring of the curriculum and \nthe exit proficiency test, which closes the language studies of English major students.  Although the \nactual needs of English majors might vary from country to country, the applied process of \nquestionnaire design, validation and data analysis can serve as a model or example for other \ninstitutions in and outside the region.   \n \nIssues and methods in needs analysis \n \nIn learner-centered approaches, learner needs have been of prime importance, and the study \nof these needs \u2013 known as needs analysis or needs assessment - has become an important part of \ncurriculum design. The early study of needs analysis is associated with the work of Munby (1978), \nwho developed one of the earliest models of needs analysis for language syllabus design. During the \npast decades the use of needs analysis has been extended to other fields of applied linguistics, \ntherefore the definition of needs and needs analysis varies from scholar to scholar. \nOne of the most general definitions of needs is given by Berwick (1989), who claims that a \nneed is expressed \"as a gap or measurable discrepancy between a current state of affairs and a \ndesired future state\" (p. 52). An even more simple definition is given by Brindley (1989), according \nto which needs analysis shows \"the gap between what is and what should be\" (p. 65). Obviously, \ngiven such broad definitions, it is necessary to specify in each case of needs analysis research what \nis meant by the \"current state of affairs\", and whose gaps and desires are to be investigated. These \ndifferent interpretations of needs have led to a great deal of disagreement between researchers and \nhave given birth to several approaches to the interpretation and analysis of needs. \nOne of these approaches is the 'narrow' (product-oriented, objective) interpretation \n(Brindley, 1989), where the learners' needs are seen as the language they will have to produce in a \nparticular communicative situation, in other words, needs mean target language behaviour in a \ntarget language situation. This orientation is applied, for instance, by Bachman and Palmer (1996), \n 5 \nwho argue that \"needs analysis, or needs assessment, involves the systematic gathering of specific \ninformation about the language needs of learners and the analysis of this information for purposes \nof language syllabus design\" (p. 102). According to what Brindley refers to as 'broad' (process-\noriented, subjective) interpretation, needs are individual learner needs in the learning situation, \nwhich entail a number of affective, cognitive and even social factors. We have to note that the use \nof 'objective' and 'subjective' needs analysis is not consistent in the literature. Some researchers, \nsuch as Nunan (1988a, 1988b), use them to describe objective\/factual and subjective\/perceived \ninformation about learners. \nBased on those two approaches, Hutchinson and Waters (1987) distinguish between two \ntypes of needs: target needs and learning needs. Target needs comprise necessities (what the learner \nhas to know in order to function effectively in the target situation), lacks (the gap between target \nand existing proficiency of the learner), and wants (the learners' view on their needs). Learning \nneeds, on the other hand, is a cover term for all the factors connected to the process of learning like \nattitude, motivation, awareness, personality, learning styles and strategies, social background etc. \n(for a detailed discussion of types of needs see e.g., Berwick, 1989; Brindley, 1989; Hutchinson & \nWaters, 1987; West, 1994).  \nThere are various ways in which needs can be assessed, which obviously vary according to \nthe purpose of the analysis. The most commonly used tools are questionnaires, interviews, \nobservation schedules, and consultations, which may be designed for various audiences (learners, \nteachers, administrative staff, etc.) depending on the purpose of the assessment (for a classification \nof inductive and deductive methods see Berwick, 1989; for a critical analysis of methodologies see \nSwales, 1989). As several researchers argue, it is desirable to use a combination of these methods. \nConcerning the content of any form of needs analysis, opinions differ to a great extent. It \nseems that each research project requires a different set of focal points. The oldest model was given \nin Munby (1978), who identified nine points to inquire about, and several researchers have \n 6 \nelaborated on this model or developed a new one (see e.g. Hutchinson & Waters, 1987; Nunan \n1988a, 1988b), but there are as many types of needs analysis tools (questionnaires, etc.) as projects.  \nAlthough the roots of needs analysis derive from learner-centeredness and ESP (English for \nSpecific Purposes) curriculum design, it has been widely applied in other fields of applied \nlinguistics research. Besides using needs analysis to determine course content (curriculum, syllabus) \nin ESP, EAP (see e.g. Benesch, 1996; Fulcher, 1999) and also GE (General English; see e.g. \nSeedhouse, 1995), needs analysis can also be a helpful tool in the planning of course duration, \ncourse intensity, teaching methodology, staff matters, the grouping of learners and any language \npolicy\/planning situation (for a discussion of the place of needs analysis in language planning and \ncurriculum development see Johnson, 1989). \nStrongly related to the matter of curriculum\/syllabus design, needs analysis has gained \nconsiderable attention in the field of language testing as well. This was pointed out by Carroll \n(1980), who claimed that one of the three elements of test design is analysing the participants' \ncommunicative needs, and later by Fulcher (1999) who argues that test specifications for an EAP \ntest should \u201cflow as naturally from needs analysis as the EAP course itself\" (p. 221). The direct link \nbetween the content of a course and its assessment is obvious, thus Fulcher (1999) connects the \nissue of needs analysis to the matter of content validity. However, it is not only content that is \nconcerned here, but also test format, or task type. As Bachman and Palmer (1996) argue, regardless \nof whether test-developers are familiar with the target language use domain, they need to refine \ntheir \u2018best guesses' with a systematic approach to identifying the tasks.  \n \n 7 \nMETHOD \nResearch questions \n \nIn our study we were primarily interested in target needs, and within them the learners' \nviews of their needs, that is, their language wants. There were several reasons for choosing this \ncomponent of needs as a focus of our investigation. Firstly, as teachers of English majors with at \nleast ten years of experience, we had implicit views of what students need to know in order to \nfunction effectively in academic settings. There is also a large body of literature that describes the \nacademic skills university students need to acquire (e.g. Jordan, 1997). Nevertheless, we knew very \nlittle about the purposes English majors use the target language  for outside the university, and we \nhad even less information concerning the type of situations in which students might need the \nlanguage after graduation. Another reason for focusing on students' wants was that because they can \ntake up a wide variety of jobs, an extensive survey of employers' needs would have been very \ncomplicated to carry out. In addition, a study that investigated what expectations employers have as \nregards the English language skills of their employees in general had already been conducted, and \nwe could rely on its results to a certain extent (B\u00e1r\u00e1ny, Major, Martsa, Nagy, Nemes, Szab\u00f3 & \nV\u00e1ndor, 1999).  \nOur initial research questions were the following: \n1. What are the present and future language wants of English majors in Hungary? \n2. Are there any differences between students in different years of their study and in \ndifferent Hungarian universities as regards their language wants? \nIn order to verify whether the expectations of students regarding their future language wants are \nrealistic, in the follow-up phase of the research, we added a third research question: \n3. What are the language wants of former English majors in their present private and \nprofessional life? \n 8 \n Our hypotheses were that English majors use English mainly for academic purposes during their \nuniversity studies and that after graduation they will make use of their language skills in the field of \nbusiness and in teaching English as a foreign language. Even though the main research tool used in \nthe investigation was a questionnaire, before and while designing it, we combined several research \nmethods such as interviews and guided compositions. \n \nSettings and procedures \n \nThe main instrument used to assess the language learning needs of English majors in Hungary was a \nquestionnaire. The major advantage of questionnaires is that data can be collected from a large \nnumber of respondents in a cost-effective way within a short period of time. Provided that the \nrespondents are chosen appropriately, the results obtained with the help of the questionnaires can be \ngeneralised to the target population. A pre-condition for this is that the questionnaire used must be \nboth valid and reliable. We applied several methods in constructing the questionnaire in order to \nensure its reliability and validity, most of which were elaborated by Alderson and Banerjee (1996).  \nFor source of items, we did not only rely on existing questionnaires (e.g. Weir, 1983; \nNunan, 1988a; Nunan & Lamb, 1996; Richterich, 1980) and the theoretical framework provided by \nthe study of the Education Committee of the European Union (Council of Europe, 2001), but \ncollected preliminary qualitative data from future respondents. 153 second and third year English \nmajors at E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University Budapest were asked to write an essay with the title \"What do I \nuse English for\". In this essay students described the situations in which they use the target \nlanguage at present and in which they foresee they will need English after graduation. The \ncompositions were analysed with qualitative methods and categories of language use were set up. \nThese categories together with those found in the literature were incorporated in the questionnaire.  \nOnce we compiled the first version of the questionnaire, we submitted it to tests of validity \nand reliability. In order to ensure that the respondents interpret the questions in the same way as \n 9 \nintended by us and that they fully understand the questions (response validity), we used the \ntechnique of verbal reporting (Alderson & Banerjee, 1996). Nine English majors from the target \npopulation at E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University were asked to think aloud while filling in the questionnaire. \nThe think-aloud sessions were recorded, and certain items were modified on the basis of the \nanalysis of the protocols. \nFor checking the reliability of the questionnaire, we used test-retest reliability and internal \nconsistency analysis (Alderson & Banerjee, 1996). With the help of the former method, it can be \nrevealed whether the answers given by the participants remain stable when filling in the \nquestionnaire for the second time. 30 English majors in the second and third year of their studies at \nE\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University, Budapest filled in the questionnaire twice with a two-week interval. Due \nto the relatively low number of respondents, the accepted level of correlation between answers \ngiven at the first and second time was set for r > 0.7. Items that did not reach this level of \ncorrelation were either eliminated or reworded. The decision on the elimination of answers was also \nfacilitated by the internal consistency analysis. Since the questionnaire did not investigate one \nspecific and clearly defined concept, but several thematic issues, we divided the questions into four \ngroups: questions concerning  \n1) academic language use, \n2) using English for teaching, \n3) using English for other professional purposes, \n4) public language use. \n Questions concerning the private domain were not submitted to internal consistency \nanalysis, as the scope of the questions was very varied. The internal consistency analysis supported \nthe test-retest reliability analysis, as the items that were found problematic in the test-retest \nprocedure were the ones that were not consistent with the rest of the items in the group. After \ndeleting these questions, the Cronbach \u03b1 coefficients in the four groups of questions were all above \n0.8 (questions concerning using English for teaching: \u03b1 = 0.97; questions concerning using English \n 10 \nfor other professional purposes: \u03b1 = 0.88; questions concerning public language use: \u03b1  = 0.85; \nquestions concerning academic language use: \u03b1 = 0.81). \n \nQuestionnaire \n \nThe final version of the questionnaire for under-graduate students comprised two main sections. In \nPart 1 we asked participants five biographical questions concerning their age, the number of \ncompleted semesters, other majors, part-time jobs and plans for future career. Part 2 consisted of \ntwo main parts: 48 questions inquired about the frequency of situations of English language use at \npresent and another 48  about the expected frequency of situations of English language use after \ngraduation. Students had to indicate their answers on a 5-point Likert scale, on which value 1 \nrepresented 'never' and value 5 'very frequently, on a daily basis'. Each point of the scale was \ndefined so that students could select their answers more precisely (see Appendix for the \nquestionnaire). In the case of questions concerning future situations of language use, participants \nwere also offered a \"don't know\" choice. The 96  questions can be divided into five main domains \nof language use: the private, public, academic and professional domain, as well as situations of \nlanguage use while teaching English to foreign language learners. Within these domains the \nquestions asked about types of texts listened to and read, as well as types of output produced in \nspeech, writing and mediation (see Appendix for the questionnaire). \n The questionnaire was slightly modified when used with former students, but only to the \nextent necessary to make it appropriate for the target population. It had a similar structure: Part 1 \ncontained biographical questions about age, job and other majors. Part 2 contained the same items \nas the questionnaire for the undergraduate students, but here we inquired only about present \nsituations of language use and the 'don't know' option was not offered. \n \n \n 11 \nParticipants  \n \nThe participants of the research were students majoring in English in the first phase, and former \nEnglish majors in the second phase. We call our participants \u2018English majors', but the term should \nnot be misleading. The education system in Hungary is very different from the American or British \nsystem. In Hungary university students receive an 8-10 semester long training, at the end of which \nthey get a degree that is declared by Hungarian law (the 1993 Higher Education Act) as equivalent \nto an M.A. Students can choose to only major in English or to be double majors, pairing English up \nwith another subject such as history, sociology, psychology, mathematics, or another foreign \nlanguage.  English major students study English linguistics, literature, history, culture, applied \nlinguistics and language pedagogy, as well as participate in language development classes. They \ncan choose to obtain a degree with a teaching qualification or without it. The students' level of \nEnglish language proficiency is around or above upper-intermediate level when they enter the \nuniversity, and they are required to reach a near-native level of competence by the time they finish \ntheir studies. Most students start university at the age of 19-22 and graduate at 24-28. Based on \ninformation from the enrolment list of E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University, Budapest, we can estimate that \napproximately 75% of English majors in Hungary are female and 25% male. \n In the first phase of the research the questionnaire was filled in by 279 undergraduate \nstudents at six universities of Hungary (see Table 1 for the distribution of participants according to \nuniversities). Altogether 300 questionnaires were mailed to instructors at the universities, and they \nadministered the questionnaires to their students in their classes. According to the figures published \nin the annual Higher Education Enrolment Catalogue in 2001, there are about 2,500-3,000 English \nmajors in Hungary, thus the surveyed undergraduate students constitute roughly 10% of the target \npopulation.  \nTwo of the universities were located in the capital of Hungary, Budapest and four of them in \nbig cities in the provinces. Out of the six universities five were state-owned and one was owned by \n 12 \nthe Catholic Church. Our initial aim was to survey English language majors who are in the third, \nfourth and fifth years of their study because we assumed that they would have more specific plans \nconcerning their future than students in the first year. Nevertheless, colleagues at other universities \nmade some first and second year students fill in the questionnaire, and therefore we also took data \ngained from them into consideration (see Table 2 for the distribution of participants according to \nyears of study). \n \n----------------------------------------- \nInsert Tables 1 and 2 around here \n----------------------------------------- \n \nIn the second phase of the study 80 former English majors who had obtained a degree at \nE\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University between 1996 and 2001 completed the questionnaire.  (We chose the year \n1996 because those who graduated in 1996 had started their studies in or around 1991, that is after \nthe major political and socio-economic changes in the country and the region.) First we used snow-\nball sampling, that is, we contacted a few of our past students with whom we had personal contact, \nand asked them for addresses of further possible participants. All together 65 graduates were \ncontacted in this way either by email or by mail, of which 50 students returned the questionnaires \nfilled in.   Next we selected 70 students from the list of students who graduated not later than five \nyears ago. This list was provided by the university administration, but contained addresses that were \nused by students at the time of their graduation. This might explain why only 30 questionnaire were \nsent back to us. The response rate in the survey of graduate students was 59%. \nThe respondents' age ranged from 24 to 34. Approximately 120 students graduate annually \nfrom E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University with a degree in \u201cEnglish language and literature\" (Source: \nDepartment statistics of refereed MA theses). Thus the surveyed population represents \napproximately 13% of English majors who graduated from this university in the past five years. The \n 13 \njob opportunities for English majors might be different in the four major cities of Hungary where \nthe other universities are located, but unfortunately due to data protection laws, it was impossible \nfor us to have access to addresses of students who graduated at other universities. Nevertheless the \nlanguage learning wants of students in similar jobs can be assumed to be similar across the country. \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe filled in questionnaires were computer-coded and analysed with the help of the program \nStatistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). For each item descriptive statistics were produced, \nand for comparative analysis one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used. The significance \nlevel in this study was set for p < .05. \n \nResults and discussion \n \nPlans concerning future career and students' part-time jobs \n \nOur first questions were concerned with the jobs the participants intend to fill after \ngraduating from university and the part-time jobs they have besides studying. As Table 3 shows, out \nof the 279 participants, 142, that is, 50.9% of the respondents, have no idea about the jobs they \nwould like to take after graduation. More than half of those participants who have plans concerning \ntheir future career  (n = 78, 28% of the total sample) intend to become teachers, 9% (n = 25) of the \nrespondents wish to become translators or interpreters, and 3.2% (n = 9) would like to work in \nbusiness. An equal percentage of students would like to take a job in tourism and catering (n = 9), \nand 2.2% of the participants would like to work in the printed and electronic media (n = 6). Only \n1.1% of the surveyed population intends to do research or obtain a PhD. Other jobs mentioned by \nthe students include psychologist, sociologist, photographer and educational manager.  \n 14 \n \n----------------------------------------- \nInsert Table 3 around here \n----------------------------------------- \n \nMost students do not have a part-time job (n = 186, 66.7%) besides being a university \nstudent. 23.7% of the respondents (n = 66) work as teachers, 1.8% as translators (n = 5), and 0.7% \nof the respondents (n = 2) work in business and as office assistants respectively. Other part-time \njobs mentioned by the students include aerobics instructor, baby-sitter, tour-guide, copy-editor, \nteaching assistant and photo-editor. \n We also analysed whether students have more specific plans concerning their future career \nas they advance in their studies. It was interesting to observe that as the participants progressed in \ntheir university studies, they became only slightly more certain about their future jobs. 66% of the \nstudents who completed seven or more semesters did not know what job they would like to take. \n57.6% of those who finished eight or more semesters did not have any plans concerning their \ncareer, and only 48.2% of the respondents in the last year of their studies (nine or more completed \nsemesters) knew what job they would like to take. \n The distribution of the jobs taken by the 80 English majors after graduation is in accordance \nwith the undergraduate students' plans (see Table 4). 31.3% of the participants work as teachers, but \nteaching is also a part-time job for all the post-graduate students, for certain translators and for \nsome participants working in business. 25% of the graduates found employment in business, and \n11.3% do translations for a living. 6.3% of the participants work as educational managers and 3.8% \nas journalists. 2.5% of the participants are employed in the field of information technology and \n1.3% as full-time researchers. \n 15 \n \n----------------------------------------- \nInsert Table 4 around here \n----------------------------------------- \n \n These results suggest that English language majors in Hungary use their university studies as \na springboard. Only a quarter of the students wish to become teachers and work currently as \nteachers besides studying, and the rest of the students who have specific plans intend to work either \nas translators or in business. The distribution of the jobs selected by former English majors also \nshows that approximately a third of those with an English degree make a living only by teaching. \nThe rest of the surveyed participants are employed either as translators or in the field of business, or \ntake a variety of jobs such as journalist, educational manager etc. What makes the job of curriculum \nand test-designers very difficult is that more than half of the students do not know at all, not even \nclose to the end of their studies, what job they intend to fill. This would suggest that a basic aim of \nthe training English language majors receive in our country should be to develop their general \nEnglish language competence so that they will be able to use the language competently in a wide \nvariety of jobs and situations.  \n \nThe present language wants of students \n \nThe major part of the questionnaire comprised items concerning various situations in which \nstudents currently use English. In Table 5 mean values close to 5 indicate that students use English \nin a given situation on a daily basis, while mean values around 4 represent a frequency of once or \ntwice a week. Mean values around 3 express a monthly frequency, and values around 2 mean that \nparticipants use English in the given situation once or twice a year. Mean values around 1 indicate \nthat the respondents never need English in that particular situation. As Table 5 suggests, the most \n 16 \nfrequent situations in which the respondents use English are related to their university studies. \nEnglish language majors listen to lectures and take notes while doing so almost on a daily basis. \nThey listen to the other students' presentations, express their opinion verbally, use dictionaries and \nread professional books once or twice a week. They read professional journals, and texts on the \nInternet and take notes while reading less frequently, only once or twice a month. The participants \nhold presentations in English and write essays also with a monthly frequency. What surprised us as \nteachers of English majors was that the participants only read fiction in English with a monthly \nfrequency. This finding does not match the requirements in the curriculum of the English studies \ncourses where students are supposed to read fiction in English on a weekly basis. The results of the \nsurvey seem to suggest that students either do not read the compulsory readings regularly or that \nthey read them in Hungarian instead of English.  \n----------------------------------------- \nInsert Table 5 around here \n----------------------------------------- \nStudents do not seem to use English outside the university very often. In their private lives \nthe respondents watch English language films and news and read newspapers in English once or \ntwice a month. As can be seen in Table 5, the participants have more chance to converse with non-\nnative speakers of English (X = 3.12) than with native speakers (X = 2.61). English language \nmajors occasionally watch entertainment programmes on television (X = 2.65)  and read instruction \nmanuals (X = 2.77) in English. They sometimes interpret (X = 2.62) and translate for family \nmembers, friends or acquaintances (X = 2.33). The respondents hardly ever chat on the Internet or \nwrite traditional letters in English. Nevertheless they sometimes use English when writing e-mail \nmessages (X = 2.58). \nAs also suggested by the figures concerning the participants' part-time jobs, the participants \nuse English for teaching purposes on average with a monthly frequency. If we examine the most \nfrequently selected answers, however, it turns out that participants can be divided into two distinct \n 17 \ngroups: those who use English for teaching purposes with weekly frequency and those who never \nuse it.  As can be seen in Table 5, English language majors hardly ever use English in business or \nfor official purposes before graduation. They hardly ever translate texts or interpret in business or \npublic situations. \n As the results presented above indicate, current language learning needs of English language \nmajors in Hungary are mainly related to study skills. Our participants rarely use English outside the \nsphere of the university, and if they do, they mainly read newspapers or magazines or watch various \ntelevision programmes in English. This means that in their private lives students use the receptive \nskills more frequently than the productive skills, and that at present mediation skills are seldom \nneeded by the participants. \n \nDifferences according to length of study \n \nWe also investigated whether English language majors in Hungary have varying language wants in \ndifferent years of their study by means of one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and a number of \ndifferences between the various groups of participants were found. Students in the second year of \ntheir studies play with computer games the language of which is English significantly more \nfrequently than those in the fifth year of their studies (F = 3.50, p = 0.008), which indicates the \nincreasing role of electronic games in younger students' lives. Participants in the fifth year were \nfound to take notes while listening to lectures significantly less frequently than third and fourth year \nstudents (F = 4.87, p = 0.001). This is due to the fact that owing to the curricular requirements, fifth \nyear students in Hungary have to attend very few lectures in the last year of their studies. \nRespondents in the fifth year also express their opinion less frequently in English than fourth year \nstudents (F = 3.07, p = 0.001), but they ask questions (F = 4.50, p = 0.002) and give instructions as \nteachers (F = 3.77, p = 0.005) significantly more frequently than students in the third year. These \ndifferences are also caused by the structure of the curricula applied in training English language \n 18 \nmajors in Hungary. Generally students in the fifth year of their studies take part in school-based \npractical teacher-training, in the course of which they  observe and also teach a number of lessons. \nIn this year they usually take very few courses, and besides doing their teaching practice, they write \ntheir thesis. Therefore students in the last year of their studies use language functions related to \nteaching more frequently and certain study skills less frequently than students in the third and fourth \nyear. \n \nDifferences according to universities \n \nWe also analysed whether the language learning needs of the participants differed according \nto the universities the students attend by means of one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Very \nfew significant differences were found at the p < 0.05 level. The ANOVA procedure and the post-\nhoc Scheffe test showed that participants from the University of Debrecen read texts on the Internet \nsignificantly more frequently than students at E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University, Budapest and students at \nthe University of P\u00e9cs (F = 3.59, p = 0.004). This difference is probably due to the differing ease of \naccess to electronic resources at the universities. Students at the University of Debrecen also read \nfiction in English significantly more frequently than students at the University of Szeged (F = 3.31, \np = 0.006), which difference might be caused by different requirements in the curricula at the two \nuniversities. Another difference concerned the frequency with which students watch documentaries \non television. Students at the University of Debrecen were found to watch documentaries \nsignificantly more frequently than students at E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University (F = 3.53, p = 0.004). No \nsignificant differences were found between the participating six universities in any other respect. \n From these results, we can conclude that the language learning needs of English language \nmajors at different universities in Hungary are fairly homogenous. This in turn calls for national co-\noperation in designing effective curricula and valid and reliable language exit tests in the language. \n \n 19 \nThe future language wants of students \n \nIn the first phase of the research students were also asked about the situations in which they \nintend to use English in the future. Since in a follow up-stage of our research we administered the \nsame questionnaire to 80 former students, we were able to compare the expectations of current \nstudents to the actual frequency with which former English majors with a degree use English. The \ncomparison of the data gained from the two populations shows that undergraduate students over-\nestimated the frequency with which they are going to use the language in 34 questionnaire items out \nof the 48 items. In the case of these 34 items, the independent samples t-test showed statistical \ndifferences at the p < 0.05 level. These differences, however, were not always meaningful, since \nonly in 15 questions was the difference higher than 0.7 on a scale with an interval of 1.0. In one of \nthe items under-graduate students under-estimated the frequency of language use. These results \nsuggest that under-graduate students cannot judge appropriately how frequently they will need \nEnglish in specific situations. Nevertheless, the most frequent and least frequent situations \nundergraduate participants thought they would use English in are the same as indicated by \nparticipants who already finished their studies.  \nAs can be seen in Table 6, the four most frequent situations in which former students use \nEnglish are the reading of texts on the Internet (X = 4.23), the use of monolingual dictionaries (X = \n4.02), and expressing opinion (X = 3.97) and job-related conversations (X = 3.73). In the academic \ndomain the respondents read professional books (X = 3.67)  once a week and journals once a month \n( X = 2.91). Study skills such as taking notes, giving and listening to presentations are rarely needed \nafter graduation. In the private domain former students watch news (X = 3.56) and films in English  \n(X = 3.31) approximately twice a month, and read newspapers (X = 3.51), fiction (X = 3.37) and \ninstruction manuals (X = 2.96) in English with a monthly frequency. English majors with a degree \nconverse with non-native speakers (X = 3.46) and  write e-mail messages (X = 3.61) in English \nweekly, and these two types of communication can take place both in the private and in the business \n 20 \nsphere. On average the participants read and write business documents and letters once or twice a \nmonth, and use English for teaching purposes with a weekly frequency. English is hardly ever \nneeded in the public sphere; it is only public documents that are read by the participants once or \ntwice a month (X = 3.23). \nThe results suggest that after graduation, English majors use production skills in English \nmore frequently than during their university studies. They use the language for expressing their \nopinion, in job-related conversations and in conversations with non-native speakers with a weekly \nfrequency. The role of the Internet also increases to a considerable extent after graduation. \nParticipants with an English degree use English most frequently for reading texts on the Internet, \nwhereas before graduation this was the tenth most frequent situation of language use. Among the \nreceptive skills, mainly reading is used, but participants sometimes watch news and films in \nEnglish, where their listening skills are also needed. \n \n \n----------------------------------------- \nInsert Table 6 around here \n----------------------------------------- \nDifferences according to jobs \n \nSince the 80 former students work in very different kinds of jobs, their different language \nwants were also investigated by means of one-way analysis of variance in this study. Table 7 shows \nthe mean values for the various situations of language use in six different jobs: teacher, translator, \njob in the business sphere and in the field of information technology, educational manager and \njournalist. In this analysis participants who had part-time jobs as teachers were excluded and only \nthe graduates with one particular job were included. Teachers were found to ask questions (F = \n104.4, p < 0.0001), give instructions (F = 104.4, p < 0.0001) and explanations (F = 124.7, p < \n 21 \n0.0001), correct homework (F = 37.34, p < 0.001) and translations (F = 23.47, p < 0.001), listen to \nstudent presentations (F = 9.53, p < 0.001) and write tasks (F = 79.85, p < 0.0001) and tests (F = \n37.38, p < 0.001) significantly more frequently than the rest of the participants. Teachers and \neducational managers also express their opinion verbally in English more frequently than translators \nand those working in the field of information technology (F = 5.79, p = 0.001), but teachers read \ntexts on the Internet significantly less frequently than the other participants (F = 3.23, p = 0.01).  \n Translators translate business documents (F = 4.94, p = 0.001), business letters (F = 4.21, p \n= 0.003), books and articles (F = 7.57, p < 0.001), significantly more frequently than graduates in \nother jobs. Translators and graduates in the field of information technology also read instruction \nmanuals in English more frequently than participants in other jobs (F = 4.83, p = 0.001). \nBusinessmen and translators read (F = 7.70, p < 0.001),  and write business documents (F = 10.53, p \n< 0.001),  significantly more frequently than teachers, while business letters are read (F = 10.68, p < \n0.001), and written (F = 9.45, p < 0.001),  more frequently by those working in business and as \neducational managers than by teachers. In addition, educational managers write official letters \nsignificantly more frequently than teachers (F = 3.41, p = 0.01).  \n----------------------------------------- \nInsert Table 7 around here \n  ----------------------------------------- \n The results show that the language wants of teachers are distinctly different from the wants \nof participants in other professions. They mainly use English for teaching purposes, and they hardly \never need the language in the business and public sphere. Translators differ from other respondents \nin their need of translation skills. It is interesting to observe that in other respects translators, \neducational managers, businessmen and journalists have very similar language wants. They \nfrequently use English in the business sphere for reading and writing various types of business \nletters and documents, and speak English in job-related conversations. This finding indicates that \n 22 \nthe teaching of business English also needs to constitute an important part of the curriculum for \nEnglish majors.  \n \n \nConclusion  \n \nThe analysis of English majors' needs described in this paper has two major conclusions. It has \nbecome evident to the researchers that the assumptions and insights of instructors regarding student \nneeds were by and large correct. Yet, it can also be concluded that with the help of valid and \nreliable research it is possible to get a much more complete, complex and refined picture of those \nneeds.  The information gained can be used both in the shaping of the curriculum and also in the re-\ndesigning of the exit proficiency test by test designers refining their \u2018best guesses' (Bachman and \nPalmer, 1996). \n The research results confirmed that the present practice of primarily including EAP in the \ncurriculum is appropriate since students tend to use English mainly for study purposes.  On the \nother hand, it was new information for the faculty that students read relatively little in English.  The \nconclusion drawn from that can either be that students do not read the set literature in English \nbecause the requirements are not enforced effectively enough, or, alternatively, because they find it \neasier to read the articles and books in Hungarian.  This has implications for the design of the exit \ntest, namely that the development of reading skills specifically as regards the comprehension of \nacademic texts has to be tested systematically.  \n Another skill that has to be taught is note taking while listening.  This is obviously needed \nwhen the students listen to lectures and is useful for those who wish to pursue postgraduate studies \nat foreign universities. In the area of speaking, the importance of oral expression of ideas and \nargumentation has been confirmed. The results showed that English majors use English in \nconversation with non-natives more than with native speakers of the language. For the curriculum \n 23 \ndesigner this means that it is necessary to timetable classes with native speakers to provide exposure \nto native language use. On the other hand, an increased awareness of certain learning strategies, \nsuch as seeking opportunities for using the language with native speakers, should be achieved.  \n The results suggest that English language majors in Hungary use their university studies as a \nspringboard. Only a quarter of the students wish to become teachers and work currently as teachers \nbesides studying, and the rest of the students who have specific plans intend to work either as \ntranslators or in business. The distribution of the jobs selected by former English majors also shows \nthat approximately a third of those with an English degree make a living only by teaching. The rest \nof the surveyed participants are employed either as translators or in the field of business, or take a \nvariety of jobs such as journalist, educational manager etc. Not surprising is the fact that many of \nour graduates run two different jobs, a full time job in business or translating and a part time \nteaching job. The discrepancy between present and future needs is clear. While at present the \nstudents need primarily EAP, in the future they do not foresee much use of those skills.  At the \nsame time, they expect to use a few skills more frequently after than before graduation. On the basis \nof the research results, elective courses in mediation skills, business English, and classroom English \nmust also be included in the curriculum. \n With the respondents representing roughly 10% of the target population our findings allow \nfor some generalization.  By making the above results public, similar changes in both curriculum-\ndesign and proficiency testing can be initiated at other English Departments in the country. Beyond \nthat, cooperation is being sought between the English Departments for the purpose of implementing \na common exit test for English majors nationwide.  For those who teach under somewhat different \ncircumstances and must therefore carry out their own needs analysis, the applied procedure can \nserve as an example to model their research on. \n 24 \nREFERENCES \n \nAlderson, C.
