INTRODUCTION\nCarbon materials exist in a variety of forms and above\nall, carbon nanotubes sCNTsd have attracted the most interest\nin the last decade due to their unique properties. CNTs with\nhigh aspect ratio, good mechanical properties, and high cur-\nrent carrying capacity are especially suitable for tip-based\nelectron field-emission devices. CNTs have promising field-\nemission properties and threshold fields as low as 1.6 V\/mm\nsfor an emission current of about 1 nAd have been reported.1\nTo obtain low threshold fields from field emitters, a large\nlocal electric field is required at the emitter\u2019s tip. The ratio of\nthe local electric field over the applied geometrical macro-\nscopic electric field is the field-enhancement factor b and is\ngenerally related to the height and radius of the emitter.2 A\npossible approach to obtain high field-enhancement factors is\nto vertically align these CNTs perpendicular to the substrate.\nSince only the CNT tip is exposed to the anode, a high con-\nfinement of the electric field can be obtained hence increas-\ning the local field at the tip. However, one drawback is when\nthe CNTs are too closely packed together; the electric field is\nshielded away from neighboring CNTs.3 To avoid such a\nproblem, the separation distance between individual CNTs\nneeds to be precisely controlled. The position, alignment,\nheight, and tip radius of CNTs are controllable via the syn-\nthesis process.4 CNTs and carbon nanofibers sCNFsd, al-\nthough originating from a similar catalyst, differ in terms of\ntheir diameter and structure. Generally speaking the CNT\ndiameter is below 50 nm, with well-developed and aligned\ngraphene planes parallel to the axis of growth in the nano-\ntube. On the other hand, CNFs have a structure which is a\nmixture of aligned graphene planes as well as a bamboolike\nor cup-stacked structure, previously ascribed to herringbone-\nlike structure. In general the fibers have a diameter in excess\nof 50 nm, and do not have a continuous void in the center of\nthe tube. Their electrical properties also are more resistive\ndue to the imperfect nature of the outer graphene planes.\nChemical-vapor deposition sCVDd techniques have been\na popular choice for preparing CNTs. Thermal and plasma-\nenhanced CVD techniques are used to grow CNTs\/CNFs\nover large areas by the decomposition of a suitable hydrocar-\nbon gas over a transition-metal catalyst. Plasma-enhanced\nCVD sPECVDd has the advantage of producing VACNFs\nwith much lower substrate temperatures than the thermal\nmethod.4\u20136 Another advantage of using a CVD system is the\nability of doping the CNT with gaseous dopants to enhance\ntheir conductivity. Commonly, the hydrocarbon gas is mixed\nwith NH3 in the deposition process to introduce the N\ndopant.7,8 However, in the presence of a plasma, NH3 be-\ncomes active in etching during deposition. In this work, we\nhave synthesized nitrogenated VACNFs using dc plasma-\nenhanced CVD by the decomposition of C2H2 with N2. This\navoids the use of NH3, which is a corrosive gas.\nII. EXPERIMENT\nThe CNFs were synthesized using a dc-driven PECVD\nsystem with C2H2 as the hydrocarbon source and N2 for\ndilution\/doping purposes. The substrate table is heated using\na graphite plate capable of reaching a temperature of 700 \u00b0C.\nThe anode used in this system is a stainless-steel plate with a\nseparation gap of 1.5 cm between the electrodes. The flow\nrate of the C2H2 and N2 were fixed at 5 and 100 SCCM\nsdenotes cubic centimeter per minute at STPd, respectively,\nwhile the chamber pressure was maintained at 3\u201310 Torr. Ni\nthin films were thermally evaporated onto Si substrates\nwhich already had a thin layer of SiO2. The SiO2 was grown\nusing thermal oxidation to a thickness of about 10 nm sac-\ncording to ellipsometry measurementsd and the Ni thin-film\nthickness is between 3 and 20 nm. Prior to deposition, the Ni\nthin films were first treated to thermal annealing at 700 \u00b0C in\na nitrogen atmosphere s10 Torrd for 20 min for the formationadElectronic mail: s.silva@surrey.ac.uk\nJOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS 97, 114308 s2005d\n0021-8979\/2005\/97~11!\/114308\/6\/$22.50 \u00a9 2005 American Institute of Physics97, 114308-1\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

Typically, deposition\nruns lasting 10 min were used to grow the CNF structures\nwithin our system.\nA KrF Lambda Physik Excimer laser sLPX 210id was\nalso used for the nanostructuring of Ni. The laser operates at\n248 nm with a pulse duration of 25 ns according to the\nmanufacturer\u2019s specifications. The laser beam was homog-\nenized and projected onto the Ni on Si using an aperture and\noptics. The pulse had a semi-Gaussian energy profile, 10 mm\nlong, along the Gaussian direction, and 4 mm wide, along the\nconstant energy direction. The nanostructuring was done in a\nchamber mounted on an X\u2212Y stage, under a vacuum better\nthan 1.33310\u22122 Torr. The films were irradiated at a 10-Hz\npulse repetition frequency and at 10 mm\/s by means of\nscanning. This resulted in a pulse density of 10 per unit area.\nThe best structures resulted at three specific Excimer energy\nfluences: 228, 264, and 279 mJ\/cm2.\nThe field-emission tests were carried out in a probe setup\nwith a 5-mm diameter stainless-steel ball bearing as the an-\node. The anode can be moved is three directions where the\ngap between the anode and sample was varied in step sizes\nof 2.5 mm, driven by a stepper motor. The morphology and\nstructures of the samples were investigated using scanning\nelectron microscopy sSEMd and high-resolution transmission\nelectron microscopy sTEMd.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nFigure 1sad shows the Ni thin film after annealing at\n700 \u00b0C for 30 min. The initial Ni thickness was 4.5 nm,\nprepared by thermal evaporation of a Ni wire. The formation\nof nanosized islands is due to the heat applied to the sample\nwhich causes the thin film to sinter due to surface tension.\nFigure 1sbd shows the size distribution of the sample fitted to\na log normal function giving a mean particle size of 125 nm\nand a standard deviation of 62 nm. It can be observed that\nusing this technique the islands formed are generally irregu-\nlar and the standard deviation is large. The average island\nsize is about 16 times the original film thickness. SEM im-\nages of samples with different island sizes of 34, 69, 140,\nand 180 nm are shown in Figs. 2sad\u20132sdd, respectively. These\ncorrespond to the initial Ni film thicknesses of 2.5, 3, 4.5,\nand 6.7 nm, respectively. The nanofibers grown from these\nsubstrates are shown in Figs. 2sed\u20132shd. These VACNFs were\nsynthesized at 700 \u00b0C with a 100:5 gas ratio of N2:C2H2 and\ncathodes biased at \u2212450 V. The process pressure was kept at\n3.6 Torr for the 10 min duration of the growth.\nThe variation of the initial Ni film thickness to the island\nsize is shown in Fig. 3sad. This is in agreement with the work\nof Nerushev et al.9 and Chhowalla et al.4 where the island\nsize increases with thicker Ni films. Also in agreement with\nRef. 4, the shape of these Ni islands is irregular. The dimen-\nsions of these islands are important as they act as the catalyst\nfor nanotube synthesis and controls the CNF diameter. The\nvariation of the CNF diameter with the Ni island size is\nshown in Fig. 3sbd. It is interesting to note the CNF diameter\nis proportional to the island size multiplied by a factor of 0.8,\nwhich indicates that during the growth process, the Ni is-\nlands have been deformed or contracted. This reshaping of\nthe Ni nanoparticle is due to the nucleation and growth of\ngraphene layers around it. This process creates restructured\nmonoatomic step edges at the nickel surface during C\u2013Ni\ndiffusion.10\nControl of the Ni island dimension is crucial in produc-\ning CNFs that are uniform in dimension. Thus far, the only\nway of controlling the island size is via the Ni thin-film\u2019s\ninitial thickness.4 Also the irregular shape of the Ni island\nFIG. 1. sad SEM image of the thermally annealed Ni film with an initial\nthickness of 4.5 nm. sbd Distribution of the Ni islands with a mean size of\n125 nm and standard deviation of 62 nm according to the analysis of the\nabove SEM micrograph.\nFIG. 2. sad\u2013sdd Show SEM images of films with different island sizes of 34,\n69, 140, and 180 nm, respectively.

At high energy\ns.279 mJ\/cm2d, the Ni can be completely sputtered off the\nsubstrate. Figures 4sad\u20134scd show the SEM images of the Ni\nfilm sinitial thickness of 4.5 nmd laser annealed at 228, 264,\nand 279 mJ\/cm2, respectively. The CNF synthesized from\nthe same series is shown in Figs. 4sdd\u20134sfd. The laser-\nannealed film at 228 mJ\/cm2 is shown in Fig. 4sad. Upon\nannealing, the Ni film breaks up into droplets that are more\nspherical in shape as compared to the sample that is heat\ntreated. These droplets have a more uniform distribution and\nsmaller standard deviation. However, after CNF synthesis\nthere are smaller CNFs sundergrowthd observed despite the\nNi islands not being visible before growth. As the laser en-\nergy increases, the mean Ni island size increases. It is inter-\nesting to note that this technique produces larger islands than\nthose that are thermally annealed. Also in Figs. 3sdd and 3sed\nthere are undergrowths of nanofibers present. It can be seen\nthat at high energy fFig. 4sfdg only large Ni islands are\npresent after laser processing. The CNF has a diameter of\nabout 175 nm and the undergrowth is no longer present.\nUsing this technique, we are able to control the size of the Ni\nislands despite having the same initial Ni film thickness and\nalso the interseparation distance between individual islands\nis more spacious than the thermally prepared samples. This\nseparation is important as the electric-field shielding effect3\nduring electron field emission can be minimized.\nFigures 5sad and 5sbd show the difference between a\nthermal CVD and a PECVD-grown CNF. Both samples were\ngrown at 700 \u00b0C for 20 min with a N2:C2H2 ratio of 100:5 at\n10 Torr process pressure. The sample in Fig. 5sbd is synthe-\nsized with PECVD at a cathode bias of \u2212450 V. It can be\nseen that if no plasma is present, the CNFs are curly and\nnonaligned. However, in Fig. 5sbd the tubes are more uni-\nformly grown and vertically aligned to the substrate. This\nsample is believed to be a much better field emitter since\nthere are more tips exposed to the surface. Thus far, the\nmechanism for the aligning of these tubes is not completely\nunderstood. However, vertical alignment due to \u201ccrowding\u201d\nof CNTs sRef. 12d and preferential plasma etching seems to\nbe unlikely.13 Instead, we believed that the alignment is due\nto the electric field in the plasma sheath region, which is in\nagreement with the work in Ref. 4.\nFigure 6 shows the effect of plasma-enhanced deposi-\ntion. The process pressure and deposition rate has been low-\nered to reduce the growth rate of CNFs so that the effect of\nthe plasma can be clearly observed. These samples were syn-\nthesized at 3.6 Torr for 10 min but with varying the cathode\nbias from 0 to \u2212500 V. Figure 6sad shows the as-prepared Ni\nislands before deposition. Figures 6sbd\u20136sfd represent a bias\nfrom \u2212300,\u2212350,\u2212400,\u2212450 and \u2212500 V, respectively. By\nincreasing the dc bias, the growth rate increases and also at\n\u2212500 V the CNFs are much better aligned. By introducing a\nplasma, it is believed that the local temperature at the grow-\ning CNF increases and hence creating a temperature gradi-\nent. This model is in agreement with the model proposed by\nBaker et al.14\nFIG. 3. sad Variation of the particle size as a function of the initial Ni\nthickness. sbd Variation of the mean CNF diameter as a function of the mean\nparticle size.\nFIG. 4. sad\u2013scd SEM images of Ni droplets formed by laser annealing at\n228, 264, and 279 mJ\/cm2, respectively. sdd\u2013sfd Show the CNF synthesized\nfrom the same series sinitial thickness of 4.5 nmd.\nFIG. 5.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\nElectron field-emission characterization was carried out\nis a scanning probe setup. A voltage of 0\u20132000 V is applied\nbetween the CNF sample scathoded and the stainless-steel\nball bearing anode over a separation gap of 50\u2013150mm.\nTherefore, the CNF lengths becomes negligible in compari-\nson to the vacuum gap. The applied electric field is a division\nof the applied voltage over the separation gap. Here, the gap\nis obtained by controlling the stepper motor attached to the\nprobe. The threshold field sEthd is defined as the applied elec-\ntric field required for an emission current of 1 nA.\nFigure 7 shows the field-emission characteristics of the\naligned and nonaligned CNFs and the SEM images of these\nsamples are shown in Figs. 5sad and 5sbd. The emission cur-\nrent remains in the range of 1310\u221210 A, before increasing in\nan exponential manner with respect to the applied field. The\nemission current is limited to a value of 10 mA to prevent a\nsudden surge of current in the system. The Eth for the verti-\ncally aligned CNF is about 2 and 4.5 V\/mm for the non-\naligned sample. Since the VACNF has more tips exposed to\nthe anode, one would expect that Eth would be much lower\nthan the nonaligned one. This can be explained by the\nelectric-field screening effect that has been described previ-\nously by Nilsson et al.3 The neighboring CNT shields away\nthe electric field from the surrounding, and therefore reduc-\ning the local field at the tip. It has been proposed that in\norder to obtain a maximum field enhancement, the separation\nbetween each CNT has to be twice the height of the CNT.3\nAs for the nonaligned CNT, the emission is mainly domi-\nnated by those that are much longer than the surrounding.\nOne would expect that the emission site density will be dif-\nferent, and the VACNF would have a higher number of emis-\nsion sites.\nFigure 8sad shows the field-emission characteristics of\nthose samples shown in Figs. 2sed\u20132shd. There are no signifi-\ncant differences between these samples in terms of Eth which\nis between 16 and 21 V\/mm. The lowest Eth is observed\nfrom the film with the smallest CNFs. Compared to the Eth\non Fig. 7, these Eth are much higher since the CNFs are\nmuch shorter. The emission threshold field is related to the\nlocal field experienced by the emitter. To increase the local\nfield, one can increase the aspect ratio of the emitter which is\nrelated to its height and radius. However, these samples are\nintentionally grown shorter so that these effects can be easily\nobserved. The field-emission results from the samples that\nhave been laser annealed are more complicated. Figure 8sbd\nshows the field-emission characteristics of these samples that\nhave been annealed at 228, 264, and 279 mJ\/cm2 prior to\nCNF growth and the control has the Ni island thermally an-\nnealed. For the sample that is annealed at 228 mJ\/cm2 there\nis no significant difference in Eth compared to the control\nFIG. 6.

Increasing the laser energy further to 264 mJ\/cm2\nhas created smaller Ni islands as undergrowths in addition to\nthe larger diameter fibers. These smaller diameter CNF un-\ndergrowth decreases in the threshold field from 15 to\n11 V\/mm. For further increase in laser energy Eth increases\nto 14 V\/mm with the CNFs being much larger than the con-\ntrol sample. It is possible that the electric-field screening\neffect is minimized due to spacing of the CNFs.\nIn order to investigate the effects of tube aspect ratio,\nCNFs were grown as a function of different synthesis times\nof 1\u201315 min while keeping other conditions constant. Figure\n9 shows the sad field-emission sFEd threshold field, sbd CNF\ntip diameter, and scd CNF length as a function of deposition\ntime. It is important to note that each FE threshold field is an\naverage of five different FE measurements on the sample\nwhile the dimensions of the CNFs were obtained from their\nstatistical distribution over a sampling of 50 CNFs in each\ncase. It can be seen from Fig. 9scd that the height of the\nCNFs increases with deposition time. The growth rate is non-\nlinear and we attribute this to the retardation effect from the\nNi particles during the initial growth process. With reference\nto the tip growth model, the initial growth process includes\nthe uplifting and deformation of the Ni islands and therefore\nreducing the growth rate between the 1- and 5-min synthe-\nses. Another piece of evidence for the deformation of the Ni\nparticle can be seen from Fig. 9sbd, where the diameter of the\nCNF tip decreases as the CNF length increases. It is interest-\ning to note that the initial diameter of the Ni islands is about\n125 nm, while the CNF tip diameter decreases from 72 to 27\nnm for the 1\u201315 min deposition time, respectively. The FE\nthreshold field as a function of the deposition time is shown\nin Fig. 9sad. The threshold fields for electron emission de-\ncreases from 18 to 3 V\/mm as the height of the CNF in-\ncreases and the diameter decreases. This shows that the field\nenhancement during the FE process is dependent on the geo-\nmetrical effect of the CNF\/CNT. This enhancement factor b\nis roughly proportional to the factor of h \/r, where h and r are\nthe height and radius of the emitter, respectively. Figure 10\nshows the threshold fields as a function of the h \/r factor\nextracted from the data in Fig. 9. Interestingly, the threshold\nfield is proportional to h \/r by a power law of \u22120.4; this\nrelationship suggests that the effect of electric-field screening\ngets stronger and reduces b as the length of the CNF in-\ncreases.\nThe field-emission results presented thus far have been\nemphasized as being applicable over large areas. Since car-\nbon nanotubes are generally very small as compared to the\nlarge probe measurements s5-mm diameterd, the emission\ncurrent can be dominated by only a few nanotubes, espe-\ncially in the nonaligned sample. In order to probe the FE\ncharacteristics in a microscopic scale, we modified a SEM\nsystem to perform scanning field-emission measurements.\nThe samples were mounted on an electrically isolated speci-\nmen stage in a Cambridge Instruments Stereoscan scanning\nelectron microscope. The electron field-emission anode is a\ntungsten wire sharpened via electrochemical etching, with tip\nradius of less than 500 nm. The tip can be moved within the\nFIG. 9. sad Field-emission threshold field, sbd CNF tip diameter, and scd\nCNF length as a function of deposition time. These CNFs are grown with\ngases of C2H2 and N2 at 700\u00b0 C at a pressure of 10 Torr.\nFIG. 10. Field-emission threshold fields as a function of h \/r.

Figure 11sad shows the\nSEM image of the experiment with the probe suspended\nabove the CNF film. The probe is kept at 3 mm above the\nsurface of the sample and field-emission characteristics were\nmeasured as the probe was scanned across the sample with\nan area of 7.234 mm at a step size of 400 nm. The results\nwere then analyzed and the threshold fields for the emission\ncurrent of 1 nA plotted in a three-dimensional s3Dd contour\nplot shown in Fig. 11sbd. It can bee seen that the threshold\nfields are not uniform across the sample surface and can be\ncorrelated to the surface features observed in the SEM im-\nage. The threshold fields vary from 156 to 108 V\/mm, which\nis much higher that the value observed in the larger probe\nmeasurements 18 V\/mm. There are two reasons for the dis-\ncrepancy in this case: s1d the emission area is smaller and\nmore localized, and s2d the emission current is generally con-\ntributed by a few tubes which are suppressed by the proxim-\nity effect. When we compare the surface morphology from\nthe SEM image to the FE results, it can be seen that protrud-\ning tubes dominated the FE current when probed locally. The\n3D contour map shows that the microscopic FE characteris-\ntics need to be interpreted very differently as the field-\nenhancement factor and local electric field are different in a\nmacroscopic measurement.\nIV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\nIn summary, we have examined the growth of CNFs\nfrom different initial Ni catalyst island configurations pre-\npared using a number of techniques. The Ni island is shown\nto be directly related to the CNF diameter and can be con-\ntrolled by changing the initial Ni film thickness or laser an-\nnealing condition for the thin film with different laser energy\ndensities. The structures observed in the SEM show that the\ngrowth mechanism is based on a tip growth model and the\nnanofibers are defective in the body of the tubes due to the\neffect of the Ni catalyst moving upwards toward the anode\nduring growth.\nThe field-emission results show that Eth is dependent on\nthe height and radius of the nanofibers. However, by varying\nthe spacing between individual tubes there is a reduction in\nthe threshold field that is due to lowering of the electric-field\nscreening, despite the increase in tip radius giving rise to\nlower b values.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the financial\nsupport received from the EPSRC Carbon Based Electronics\nProgramme and Portfolio Partnership Award.\n1C.
