The \nnew conceptualisation \u2013 a range of distinct but related constructs that constitute the fear \nof crime \u2013 comprises the interplay between emotion, risk perception and environmental \nperception. Data from a small-scale survey are analysed using confirmatory factor \nanalysis showing good scaling properties of the multiple indicators. Two implications of \nthe new conceptualisation for the rationality of the fear of crime are discussed. First, \nperceptions of the risk of crime seem a product of how individuals make sense of their \nsocial and physical environment. Second, the fear of crime may constitute such evlautions \nof community cohesion and moral consensus as well as specific experiences of \u2018fear\u2019 of \n\u2018crime\u2019 \u2013 a way of seeing as well as way of feeling. The conclusions of the paper consider \nramifications for the rationality of the fear of crime, particularly in the context of \nreassurance policing in England and Wales. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKey words: fear of crime; survey measurement; confirmatory factor analysis \n 3\nValidating New Measures of the Fear of Crime \n4\/26\/2010, page 4 \nThe fear of crime is a great example to use when teaching social research methodology. This \nis not just because the words \u2018fear\u2019 and \u2018crime\u2019 are sexy enough to wake up those in the \nbackrow. This is an illustrative topic because it displays a number of cautionary tales relevant \nto the use of the survey in the social sciences. It underlines the importance of question \nwording: how vague terms can produce misleading data and how qualitative data can serve as \nan important corrective. It emphasises the value of a strong theoretical basis in developing \nconcepts and measures: how the building blocks of research gain from a solid intellectual \nfoundation. And it is intriguing to learn that theoretical under-specification and rather \ntechnical issues of survey question wording may have had an deleterious impact on the \nknowledge base on what has become a high-profile public policy issue of our time. \nFor many years doubts have been raised about the validity and reliability of measures \nof the fear of crime (see, for example: Bernard, 1992; Bowling, 1993; Fattah, 1993; Skogan, \n1981; Farrall et al, 1997; and Zauberman, 1985). Looking across the quantitative literature, \nlimitations in theory and method have tended to coalesce to produce a series of rather crude \nrepresentations of this conceptually rich phenomenon. Some scholars have even argued that \nthe questionnaire is simply too blunt an instrument to effectively tap into public perceptions \nof crime, community and disorder (e.g. Girling et al 2000).  \nThis paper proposes that through the development of quantitative method we can \nproduce more sophisticated analyses of the fear of crime. The study presented here validates \nmeasures of the broadest conceptual definition yet, comprising the interplay of worry, risk \nperception, vulnerability, beliefs about crime and interpretations of one\u2019s social and physical \nenvironment. Moreover, the new measures represent technical improvements: they are \nmultiple rather than single indicators; they reflect a set of related constructs to broaden out the \nconceptualisation; and they are designed to avoid a number of problems in the question \nwording of standard survey questions.  \nThis paper also discusses the advantages of defining (and measuring) social \nphenomena in a broad and inclusive manner. When an issue calls for a conceptualisation that \naffords a process explanation, approximating the phenomenon in action and thus accounting \nfor key mechanisms, then careful research strategies are called for. Moreover, the benefits to \nexplanation and interpretation of such an approach may be significant. This paper finishes by \ndiscussing the theoretical and policy implications of just such an approach to the topic at \nhand: the fear of crime.  \n \nOutstanding dilemmas in the measurement of the fear of crime \n \nWhile few studies have empirically investigated fear of crime measures (a notable exception \nis Farrall et al, 1997), nearly all of the question variants have been criticised on some level. \n 4\nValidating New Measures of the Fear of Crime \n4\/26\/2010, page 5 \nPerception of safety questions \u2013 such as \u2018How safe do you feel walking alone in this area after \ndark?\u2019 \u2013 have received a particularly high volume of concern (for comprehensive reviews of \nthe issues see: Hale, 1996; and, Farrall et al 1997). In part a response to these problems, other \nmeasures have become standard, asking respondents to summarise their levels of worry (or \nfear in the US) about specific crimes or their perceived likelihood of victimisation. These \nmeasures show improvements, being specific about emotion or perceived risk and referring to \ndifferent types of crime, such as mugging, burglary and car crime.  \n Yet even these measures may mask considerable complexity. Respondents may \nvariously feel concern, anger, indignation, anxiety, fear or worry regarding their sense of risk \n(Ditton et al 1999; Jackson, 2004b; Carvalho & Lewis, 2003), and these may be persistent but \nlow-level states (see Hough, 2004), or they may be stronger events that come and go (see \nFarrall, 2004); they may be diffuse and complex, encompassing vague insecurities about a \nrange of social conditions, or they may be sharp responses to a sense of immediate threat. As \nsuch, some people may find it difficult to pin down and articulate their emotions. And while \nothers may feel they have a handle on their emotions, able to meaningfully summarise their \nexperiences, closed-ended survey questions on fear may elicit an articulation of complex \nfeelings in a short-hand and inexact manner \u2013 maybe even leading respondents by placing \nwords like \u2018worry\u2019 or \u2018fear\u2019 into their mouths.  \n One source of potential confusion is that standard fear of crime questions ask for \nsome sort of summary of the intensity of respondents\u2019 feelings. Emotions are most often \ntransitory: asking for an intensity of felt emotion may be asking individuals for a rather \ndifficult summary. Because of this, an alternative measurement is beginning to be developed \nand tested. Frequency questions ask respondents to think back over a relatively small time \nperiod, counting how many times they have felt worried or concerned or fearful about falling \nvictim of crime. The most notable new question set asks respondents first whether they have \nfelt fearful in the past year; then second how often that occurred, and finally how fearful did \nthey feel during the last episode (Farrall and Gadd, 2004). \n For Farrall and colleagues (e.g. Farrall et al, 1997; Farrall and Gadd, 2004; Farrall, in \npress), intensity measures have encouraged the idea that fear is a stable attribute rather than \nsomething that varies across time, location and situations. Intensity measures may further \npaint a rather exaggerated picture of how often people feel worried or afraid \u2013 reading that a \nproportion of the population is \u2018very worried\u2019 about crime might suggest that this proportion \noften feel \u2018very worried\u2019. Farrall et al (1997) found using qualitative follow-ups that given the \nfreedom to elaborate in their own words, some interviewees who had earlier reported to be \n\u2018fairly\u2019 or \u2018very\u2019 worried, reconsidered that this had occurred only rarely, in certain situations.  \n Such exaggeration may occur because, as some respondents summarise their overall \nlevel of emotion, they recall the most vivid and threatening of the \u2018spikes\u2019 or recent \n 5\nValidating New Measures of the Fear of Crime \n4\/26\/2010, page 6 \nexperiences, inferring this intensity to be representative of their experiences, and over-\nestimated the frequency of these experiences ( analogous to the availability and representative \nheuristics, see Kahneman, Slovic and Tversky, 1982). When asked to think carefully about \ntheir specific instances of worry, such respondents may revise their intensity reports and \nconclude they worry rather less frequently, and so are less worried overall, than they \notherwise would have reported.  \n Yet consider an alternative perspective. Hough (2004) argues that the fear of crime \nshould be conceived of mental states that are rarely reducible to mental events. He \ndistinguishes between fear \u2013 a mental event \u2013 and worry or anxiety \u2013 a mental state. On the \nlatter: \u2018When we talk about mental states such as anxiety or worry, we are concerned with \nintensity, not frequency. Leaving aside acute anxiety attacks, anxiety is not comprised of a \nseries of events that can be located in space and time.\u2019 The measurement of the frequency of \nworry might thus be interesting \u2013 but  more of a side-show to the main event of intensity: \nworry is not reducible to discrete mental events.  \n  But while considering the complex nature of emotion, and the difficulties of \nproducing valid and reliable data using questionnaires, let us not lose sight of an under-\ntheorised aspect of the fear of crime: what this is actually an emotional response to. A \nseemingly obvious answer looms: the risk of becoming a victim of crime. Yet this raises more \nquestions. Firstly, what constitutes risk perception? One aspect would certainly be some \nassessment of the likelihood of victimisation (Ferraro, 1995); judgements about the chances \nof oneself falling victim may be shaped by of the actual rates of crime. But risk perception \nmight be usefully broadened by incorporating other aspects of vulnerability, such as a sense \nof control over the possibility and  some evaluation of the possible consequences (Jackson, \n2004c). So, the target of worry is conceivably an overall appraisal of threat and vulnerability: \nwe worry about a threat that looms, an unpleasant possibility that we feel vulnerable towards. \nSecondly, what shapes risk perception and vulnerability? Beliefs about the prevalence \nof crime presumably play a part. But where do these beliefs come from? It may be that people \nmisunderstand the frequency of serious crime.  Lurid and misleading mass media reports may \nprovoke misguided pictures of the crime problem in the general populace. According to this \nview some people feel needlessly vulnerable. Their quality of life suffers because they see \ncrime where there is little.  \nAlternatively, risk perception and beliefs about crime may be embedded in a context \nof day-to-day communication with friends, family and local acquaintances, and in \ninterpretations of the quality of community and the social and physical environment more \ngenerally (Smith, 1989; Girling et al 2000; Jackson, 2004a; Innes, 2004). Crime may operate \nas a symbol of the deterioration of social order, of the social conditions that foster behaviour \nhostile to the moral and social framework of the community. Incivility and disorder may also \n 6\nValidating New Measures of the Fear of Crime \n4\/26\/2010, page 7 \nsymbolise crime and the conditions conducive to crime (Innes and Fielding, 2002; Ferraro, \n1995; Bannister, 1993).  Incivilities \u2013 or behaviour regarded as disorderly and disreputable \u2013 \nare visible signs of the health of a community; they can serve to communicate to observers \nthat people and authorities have lost control over the community, that commonly accepted \nstandards and values are eroding, that there is an increasing presence of a variety of sub-\ncultural groups whose public behaviour is seen as different or foreign.  \n \nThe study \n \nThis study incorporates many of the aspects just discussed into a workable definition of the \nfear of crime and makes some difficult decisions regarding question wording. Fear of crime is \nasserted to consist of worry events, subjective risk perceptions and assessments and \ninterpretations of the social and physical environment that shape the social meaning of risk \nand the sense of possibility. Because the vast majority of studies into the fear of crime have \ndealt with a complex phenomenon in a simplistic manner, there has been a failure to capture \nthe most interesting parts of the construct, as well as develop valid and reliable scales that \nreflect this richness and show careful methodological work1. Here, the fear of crime is \ndefined as a set of empirically distinct but related constructs that combine emotion, risk \nperception and vulnerability, and environmental perception. Appropriate multiple indicators \nof each construct are fielded in a mail survey and data analysed using confirmatory factor \nanalysis, formally testing the scaling properties of the new questions.   \n \nThe new measures \n \nThe definition of the fear of crime comprised: \n \n\u0083 the frequency of worry about becoming a victim of three personal crimes and two \nproperty crimes in the immediate neighbourhood of respondents (five individual \nquestions asked respondents about their worry about each single crime); \n\u0083 estimates of likelihood of falling victim of each crime locally; \n\u0083 perceptions of control over the possibility of becoming a victim of each crime locally; \n\u0083 perceptions of the seriousness of the consequences of each crime; \n                                                 \n1 Studies rarely use statistical techniques such as confirmatory factor analysis to assess the scaling \nproperties of the tools, and with only one exception (Ferraro 1995), have comprised single indicators, \nthus assuming that the solitary question entirely reflects the concept and elicits no measurement error; \nmulti-dimensional conceptions of this social phenomenon are also extremely rare in the quantitative \nresearch literature. \n 7\nValidating New Measures of the Fear of Crime \n4\/26\/2010, page 8 \n\u0083 beliefs about the incidence of each crime locally; \n\u0083 perceptions of the extent of social and physical incivilities in the neighbourhood; and, \n\u0083 perceptions of community cohesion, including informal social control and trust\/social \ncapital. \n \nThe five crimes were:  \n \n\u0083 being attacked by a stranger in the street;  \n\u0083 being robbed or mugged in the street;  \n\u0083 being harassed, threatened or verbally abused in the street;  \n\u0083 having someone break into your home whilst the inhabitants were there; and, \n\u0083 having someone break into your home whilst the inhabitants were away.  \n \nFull details of the measures can be found in the appendix. \n The emotional component was worry, rather than anxiety or fear. While we cannot \nassume that respondents interpret the concept of worry or anxiety or fear in similar ways \nwhen answering questionnaires, we do need to make a choice. And psychological theory \nsuggests that worry is preferable for the current purposes. Fear is a strong physical reaction to \na present stimulus; perhaps it is too strong a word for many of the situations people feel \nthemselves in. In turn, anxiety may be too diffuse, never involving immediate stimuli. Worry, \non the other hand, accommodates an emotional evaluation of an immediate situation, \ninterpreting cues in the environment that signify a sense of possibility and threat (a mental \nevent); at the same time it also includes a mental state, a concern about potential danger, of \nimminent and distal threat or events yet to transpire: a chain of thoughts and images about an \nunpleasant and uncertain outcome (Borkovec et al, 1983; Macleod et al, 1991). Furthermore, \nworriers can be preoccupied with negative information and future unpleasant outcomes, \nhyper-vigilant in scanning for salient material relating to threat (Mathews, 1990), see \nambiguous events as threatening (Butler and Mathews, 1983, 1987; Russell and Davey, \n1993), and over-estimate risk (Butler and Mathews, 1983, 1987; MacLeod et al, 1991; Vasey \nand Borkovec, 1993).  \n The worry questions were frequency measures. They asked respondents how often \nthey had worried about falling victim of a number of different crimes during the previous \nmonth. The frequency format was preferred to the intensity format because the latter may tap \ninto a complex and confusing amalgam of: (a) low-level anxiety (mental states); and, (b) a \n 8\nValidating New Measures of the Fear of Crime \n4\/26\/2010, page 9 \nsummary of stronger events of worry (mental events)2. Frequency measures presumably elicit \nless complicated (and perhaps more useful \u2013 see Farrall, 2004) data, focusing on specific \n\u2018spikes\u2019 of worry (Jackson, 2004b). Furthermore, limiting behavioural response questions to \nrelatively limited time horizons may elicit more accurate enumerations.  \n Worry was expected to be shaped by a subjective sense of risk and vulnerability within their \nneighbourhood. Feelings of control over the possibility of victimisation (self-efficacy) and \nperceptions of the severity of consequences of victimization combined with estimates of the \nlikelihood of victimization to form an overall appraisal of threat (cf. Tallis and Eysenck, \n1994).  \nThe appraisal of threat was hypothesised to be shaped both by beliefs about the \nbeliefs about crime and by a set of subjective perceptions of the social and the physical \nenvironment. Perceptions of the social environment comprised attitudes towards community \ncohesion, which here has two components: the extent to which the neighbourhood had a \nfriendly, supportive, and trusting community; and the level of informal social control, or the \ndegree of sub-legal social control exercised in everyday social interaction, such as active \nstigmatisation of rule-breakers and reactions from members of the local community that seek \nto control their behaviour.  \nPerceptions of the physical environment were measured by asking respondents if a \nrange of incivilities were a local problem. Incivilities are \u2018 . . . low-level breaches of \ncommunity standards that signal an erosion of conventionally accepted norms and values\u2019 \n(LaGrange et al 1992, p. 311). Biderman et al (1967) suggested that incivilities communicate \ninformation to people about local crime incidence and the threat of victimisation. Behavioural \nimproprieties may be viewed as indices of social disorganisation and threat, despite not being \ncriminal themselves (Maxfield, 1984). Incivilities may also signal that the community and \nlocal authorities are unable or unwilling to manage such problems, representing a breakdown \nin norms of behaviour and a loss of control of local people over the environment (e.g. Hunter, \n1978; Lewis and Maxfield, 1980; Smith, 1989; Donnelly, 1988). \nIn order to further increase the specificity, and therefore presumably the accuracy of \nself-reports, all the questions were explicitly about the respondents\u2019 neighbourhood. This is \nimportant. The specificity, and the use of local surveys, allows the researcher to control for \n                                                 \n2 Although there is a third and speculative possibility, first raised by a number of excellent qualitative \nstudies (e.g. Girling et al, 2000; Smith, 1989). It may be that people say they are \u2018very\u2019 or \u2018fairly\u2019 \nworried about crime without having recently been worried. This could be something more akin to an \nattitude, a way of seeing rather than a way of feeling. Such an an individual is expressing perceptions \nand evaluations of the social cohesion, moral consensus and social order of their neighbourhood and \nsociety \u2013 crime somehow acts as a symbolic net that they cast over social conditions identified as \nhostile to social order and deviant and so in need of censure (Jackson, 2004a; Jackson et al, in press). \n 9\nValidating New Measures of the Fear of Crime \n4\/26\/2010, page 10 \nthe environment of the response and thus examine how respondents who live in the same live \nhave different interpretations of, and responses to, their environment.  \n \nResearch design and sample \n \nData are from a mail survey conducted in 2001 of a pure random probability sample of 1,800 \nadult residents of two socio-economically contrasting areas of London, allowing the \nvalidation of the measures in two different contexts.. The sampling frame was drawn from the \n2001 Electoral Register, covering those adults registered to vote in the forthcoming General \nElection. The overall response rate was 26.6% with 479 completed questionnaires returned; \n33.2% in Area 1 (identified here as \u2018Victoria Gardens\u2019) and 20.0% in Area 2 (identified here \nas \u2018Katherine House\u2019). Two personalised contacts were made, with a reminder letter and \nduplicate questionnaire sent out if no questionnaire was returned within 2 weeks of the first \ncontact. A raffle was also made to encourage response with three prizes given of \u00a350, \u00a325 and \n\u00a325.  \nTo ensure anonymity, these areas have been given pseudonyms. Victoria Gardens is a \nwealthy suburb with residents who are predominantly White and middle-class and a well-kept \nphysical environment. According to local police figures, it has low personal crime rates but a \nrelatively high incidence of burglary and car crime. Katherine House is a high-rise, high-\ndensity, local authority housing estate. It has relatively large levels of personal crime \naccording to police statistics, and suffers from a significant amount of incivilities such as \ngraffiti and young people causing noise and harassment according to this survey (Jackson, \n2004c). In contrast to Victoria Gardens this is an area with a high proportion of residents from \nlow-income brackets and a diverse ethnic mix.  \n \nStrategy for analysis of data \n \nThe analysis that follows seeks to assess: (a) whether particular survey questions scale to \nform adequate measures of constructs; (b) whether the constructs themselves are empirically \ndistinct \u2013 i.e. whether worry about crime is a \u2018different beast\u2019 to perceptions of the likelihood \nof victimization or feelings of control over its occurrence; and, (c) a brief indication of how \nthe constructs form a process explanation of the fear of crime.  \nConfirmatory factor analysis (CFA) is used here. This technique allows the a priori \ntheoretical specification of a model of the latent construct(s) and indicators. The researcher \nexamines whether a theoretical model that specifies patterns of relationships between \nvariables specified according to operational procedures are consistent with the data, assessing \nthe multidimensionality of a scale or set of scales. One assumes that the inter-correlations \n 10\nValidating New Measures of the Fear of Crime \n4\/26\/2010, page 11 \nbetween measures are caused by one single latent (if one specifies measures to be measuring \nonly one construct) and the remaining \u2018noise\u2019 to be measurement error.  \n The following section reports the assessment of the reliability of the new measures \nand the validity of the new multi-dimensional conceptualisation of the fear of crime.  \n   \nResults \n \nFirst let us consider the following five constructs, where victimisation denotes the five \nindividual crime categories outlined in the \u2018new measures\u2019 section above. \n \n\u0083 Worry about victimisation;  \n\u0083 Estimate of the likelihood of victimisation; \n\u0083 Perceived control over the victimisation; \n\u0083 Estimates of the seriousness of the consequences of victimisation; and \n\u0083 Beliefs about the incidence of crime. \n \nEach construct is combined with each crime category to create 5x5 new survey questions. So, \nfor example, there are five measures of worry about victimisation: three measures of worry \nabout personal crime and two of worry about property crime (see appendix).  \nTo begin with, two models were tested on each individual construct using CFA. The \ntest of the first model considered whether all five indicators \u2013 where five questions combined \neither \u2018worry\u2019, \u2018likelihood\u2019, \u2018control\u2019, \u2018consequences\u2019 or beliefs\u2019 with each of the five types of \ncrime \u2013 formed one adequate scale for each construct. If this was so, and continuing to take \nworry as an example, the five measures that combine worry with each crime would together \nrepresent a good uni-dimensional scale of the frequency of worrying about property and \npersonal crimes.  \nThe second model divided the crimes into property and personal. If this model fitted \nthe data better than the first model then we could say that worry about crime involved \nworrying about personal and property crime, but that worrying about personal crime was not \nthe same as worrying about property crime. Rather, worry would have two factors or \ndimensions that should be treated as separate but related. The same reasoning applies to \n\u2018likelihood\u2019, \u2018control\u2019, \u2018consequences\u2019 and \u2018beliefs\u2019. \nTurning to the results, and beginning with worry, Table 1 shows the fit statistics for \nthe two models. The two-factor solution did not fit the data according to exact fit measures \n(\u03c72 =14.571; df=4; p=.006). However, the approximate fit was good: the RMSEA of 0.074 \n 11\nValidating New Measures of the Fear of Crime \n4\/26\/2010, page 12 \nindicated a good fit, and the CFI at 0.998 signified a very good fit3. This was not true for the \none-factor solution: a RMSEA of .226 showed a poor approximate fit. Table 2 shows that the \ntwo-factor solution was a statistically significant improvement on the one-factor model \naccording to the comparison of Chi-square statistics and degrees of freedom of the two \nmodels (p<.0005).  \n \nINSERT TABLE ONE ABOUT HERE \n \nIn the two-factor model, all the unstandardised loadings that were allowed to vary \nwere highly significant, in the expected directions, and close to 1. Furthermore, all R2 values \nwere above 5.0 and all standardised factor loadings were over 7.0 (Figure 1), all above the \ncut-off points of Fornell and Larcker\u2019s (1981). The measures thus had good reliability and \nvalidity. \n \nINSERT FIGURE ONE ABOUT HERE \n \nA final step in this section of the analysis was to test whether this measurement model \nof worry fitted equivalently across gender and across area. For brevity, details are not \nincluded here, but to summarise: there were equal factor loadings across gender groups and \nslight deviations between the areas that were not considered substantively significant. \nWhat does this mean? Well, the measures of worry had good scaling properties. But \nworry also had two dimensions: worry about personal crime and worry about property crime. \nThese two dimensions \u2013 worry about personal crime and worry about property crime \u2013 were \nrelated but empirically distinct. Worrying about burglary was not the same as worrying about \nbeing mugged (for example).  \nThe same analyses were performed for: \n                                                 \n3 Due to the fact that Chi Square is extremely sensitive to sample size, over-identification and \nviolations of the assumptions of multivariate normality, it has become standard for researchers to be \nrelatively unconcerned about a significant Chi Square statistic (see Bentler and Bonett, 1980; J\u00f6reskog, \n1981). One alternative is to use a relative Chi Square statistic that makes the analysis less dependent on \nsample size (Carmines and McIver, 1981, p. 80). The relative Chi Square statistic is the ratio of the Chi \nSquare and the degrees of freedom, where <2:1 or <3:1 indicate an acceptable model. Kline (1998) \nargues that 3:1 is an acceptable cut-off point. Another alternative is to use approximate fit indices that \nhave been developed to incorporate factors such as sample size relative to degrees of freedom and \nmodel parsimony (i.e. models with fewer parameters to be estimated are, all things equal, preferable) in \ntheir assessment of model fit. These non-inferential indices are used in conjunction with the standard \nChi Square statistic relative to degrees of freedom to establish the \u2018global\u2019 fit of models. The fit indices \nthat were used were Comparative Fit Index (CFI) (Bentler, 1990) and Root Mean Square Error of \nApproximation (RMSEA). The CFI has a range of 0 to 1, with 1 indicating perfect fit. Values greater \nthan .90 have traditionally been taken to indicate acceptable model fit, although more recently a cut-off \nof .95 has been suggested as more appropriate (Carlson and Mulaik, 1993).  \n \n 12\nValidating New Measures of the Fear of Crime \n4\/26\/2010, page 13 \n \n\u0083 Subjective estimates of the chances of criminal victimisation; \n\u0083 Perceptions of control over falling victim of crime; \n\u0083 Estimates of the severity of the consequences of criminal victimisation; and \n\u0083 Beliefs about the incidence of crime locally. \n \nFor each, two-factor solutions fitted the data well according to the approximate fit statistics, \nand significantly better than one-factor models (the parameter estimates are not included here \nfor reasons of brevity). The two latent constructs had convergent and divergent factorial \nvalidity (Byrne, 2001) and the indicators displayed adequate relevant validity and reliability. \nThe assessment of factorial invariance across gender and area sub-samples showed that the \nfactor loadings did not vary across groups in all domains but subjective estimates of \nlikelihood. In this exception, the factor loading relating to the \u2018burglary, in\u2019 indicator varied \nacross gender.  \n So far, then, data have indicated that the measures of worry, likelihood, control, \nconsequences and beliefs had good scaling properties, and that personal and property crimes \nwere judged differently by respondents in each case.   \nHowever, we have not yet established whether worry, likelihood, control, \nconsequences and beliefs are, in fact, empirical distinct constructs. Recall that the \nmeasurement strategy delineates the fear of crime into a set of theoretically discrete facets, \neven if they are somewhat related. The next step in the analysis was therefore to include all of \nthe indicators of all the five constructs in a series of analyses to see if they are empirically \ndiscrete. \nThree models were estimated for personal and property crime separately that included \nall the five facets so far encountered: worry, likelihood, control, consequences and beliefs. \nThe first was a five-factor model, defining each of the constructs to be separate. The second \nwas a four-factor model, combining worry and likelihood, testing whether these were not \nempirically distinct. The third was a three-factor model, combining likelihood, control and \nconsequences, testing whether these collectively reflected threat appraisal. For both personal \nand property crime the five-factor model fitted the data better than the four-factor or three-\nfactor, and the improvement in model was statistically significant in each case  (Table 2). \n \nINSERT TABLE TWO ABOUT HERE \n \nIn the five-factor models, all factor loadings variables not specified to be 1.00 (for \nidentification purposes) were statistically significant. All standardised loadings were above \n.70, and all R2s were above .50. Again, the measurement model was investigated with respect \n 13\nValidating New Measures of the Fear of Crime \n4\/26\/2010, page 14 \nto whether the factor loadings were group-invariant. There were no differences among males \nand females. This was also the case between the two areas apart from \u2018Worry about \nHarassment\u2019, which had a greater contribution to worry about personal crime in Katharine \nHouse.  \nTo take a breath for a second \u2013 and summarise the results we have encountered so far: \nwhen respondents were asked about worry, risk perceptions and beliefs about crime \nprevalence, their responses indicated that they thought about crime in two domains: personal \ncrime in public space and burglary. The measures of the five constructs that involved these \noffence categories had good scaling properties. Furthermore, respondents treated worry, \nperceived likelihood, perceived control, perceived consequences and beliefs about crime as \nseparate things: worrying was not the same as perceived control, and perceived control was \nnot the same as likelihood (to take a few examples).  \nWe now turn to environmental perceptions. First to incivilities: a two-factor model \nfitted the data better than a one-factor model (\u0394\u03c72 = 133.75; \u0394df = 1). The fit was adequate \naccording to the approximate fit statistics (RMSEA = .064; CFI = .996), if not according to \nthe exact fit statistics (\u03c72 = 38.244; df = 13; p <.0005). \nAll factor loadings not set to unity were statistically significant at the 5% level. In \nterms of validity and reliability of the individual items, four had standardised loadings and R2 \nabove the suggested cut-off points of .70 and .50 respectively. However, three were below \nthese cut-off points (\u2018rubbish in the streets\u2019, \u2018not enough things for young people to do\u2019 and \n\u2018dogs out of control\/mess\u2019). Because the overall fit of the model was acceptable, this was not \ndeemed problematic. \nThe measurement model was investigated with respect to whether the factor loadings \nwere group-invariant. They were not equal across gender groups (\u0394\u03c72 = 16.707; \u0394df = 5): \n\u2018drinking in the street\u2019 contributed more to social incivilities for males than for females, and \n\u2018rubbish in the street\u2019 had a stronger contribution to physical incivilities for females compared \nto males. The factor loadings were, however, equal in the two areas (\u0394\u03c72 = 1.168; \u0394df = 5).  \n Next to community cohesion. A two-factor model fitted the data better than a one-\nfactor model (\u0394\u03c72 = 39.976; \u0394df = 1). The fit was adequate, with a Chi Square of 30.173 at 13 \ndegrees of freedom, RMSEA of .053 and CFI of .998. Again, all factor loadings not set to \nunity were statistically significant at the 5% level. In terms of validity and reliability of the \nmeasures, all had standardised loadings and R2 above the suggested cut-off points of .70 and \n.50 respectively. The factor loadings were equal across the respective gender and area groups. \nSo far we have found that the measures of each of the constructs had good scaling properties \nand that the constructs involving crime were empirically distinct. This is an important first \nstep in a piece of quantitative research through the rigorous assessment of the basic building \n 14\nValidating New Measures of the Fear of Crime \n4\/26\/2010, page 15 \nblocks. But as the description of the measures earlier in the paper indicated, the constructs \nwere designed to relate to one another according to a particular theoretical model. While this \nis not the place for the analysis of the structural elements of the model (see Jackson, 2004c, \nfor this), it is worth providing a summary in order to demonstrate the advantages of the \ncurrent measurement strategy (Figure 2).  \n \nINSERT FIGURE TWO ABOUT HERE \n \nAs Figure 2 suggests, perceptions of the environment (incivilities and community \ncohesion) shaped respondents\u2019 assessments of the incidence of crime and of one\u2019s personal \nthreat and vulnerability (including control and likelihood). Furthermore, control and \nconsequences both predicted perceptions of the likelihood of victim; all aspects of threat \npredicted worry. Different levels of worry of respondents in the two areas were mediated by \nenvironmental perceptions and threat appraisal.  \nFinally, this is a feedback model, even though it is difficult to test using a cross-\nsectional design: worry may feed back into public perceptions of the environment, increasing \nthe tendency to see ambiguous stimuli in one\u2019s neighbourhood to indicate the lack of civility \nand cohesion and therefore the potential for crime. See Jackson (ibid.) for more details. \n \nDiscussion \n \nThis study validated measures of a broader definition of the fear of crime than currently exists \nin the literature. The new questions have five advantages over the majority of quantitative \ninstruments. First, the fear of crime is conceptualised within a broad theoretical framework. \nSecond, the definition covers a range of perceptions and responses to the environment and to \nperceived risk and vulnerability, specifying individual crimes that group in the domains of \npersonal crime in public space and burglary; this strategy has an in-built ability to account for \nthe social processes that underpin the data. Third, the questions are multiple measures of \nlatent constructs, allowing the researcher to partition measurement error and explicate \nconstructs in a more complete manner than is possible with single indicators. Fourth, the \nmeasures have been scaled using a sophisticated multivariate analysis technique, establishing \nin the context of this dataset that each construct was empirically distinct and that the single \nindicators of each construct combined adequately with the relevant other indicators.  \nFinally, the new measures avoid certain identified wording problems in existing tools. \nThe emotional aspect specifies the emotion and the victimisation categories, asking about the \nfrequency of worry within a small enough time period that respondents may be more likely to \nmake accurate summaries. Moreover, all the measures are specific to one particular \n 15\nValidating New Measures of the Fear of Crime \n4\/26\/2010, page 16 \nenvironment, focusing on respondents\u2019 neighbourhood. When combined with a local survey \nthat elicits data from a number of people who live in the same environment (and indeed that \ncontrasts two very different communities), this allows the researcher to analyse how people \nmake different subjective interpretations of the same environment, and crucially, how these \ninterpretations shape perceptions of risk and worry (see Jackson, ibid., for the results of the \nstructural modelling, and more details on the social-psychological framework).  \n Of course, the dataset was not of the highest quality. Further research is needed to \nassess the validity and reliability of the measures developed here. However, one study already \nconducted in a rural part of England has attested to these measures and the utility of the \ncurrent theoretical approach (Jackson, 2004a). The next step is to test these notions with \nrespect to a nationally representative dataset such as the British Crime Survey. \n \nConclusions: the rationality of the fear of crime \n \nThis paper began by considering how the fear of crime is conceptualised within survey \nresearch. Narrow and theoretically under-specified definitions \u2013 and measures that produce \ndata that we do not exactly know what to do with \u2013 have led to rather limited analyses. The \naim here was to offer a technical advance through the validation of new multiple indicators of \na broader conceptualisation than so far exists in the literature.  \n The new definition has a number of implications for how we study and debate the \nfear of crime. Defining the fear of crime as a set of related constructs, not just as \u2018worry\u2019 or \n\u2018safety\u2019, emphasises the complex and subjective nature of this phenomenon. Feeling \nvulnerable \u2013 feeling unable to control falling victim and feeling that consequences would be \nsevere \u2013 is here formulated as one reason why people worry. We should think hard about \nwhether we really feel able to judge whether such individuals are worrying needlessly, when \none of the reasons they worry is that they feel unable to manage the risk and its effects. \nBut more than this, risk perception and vulnerability are inherently subjective; they \nare embedded in the context of the social and physical environment, where crime gathers its \nmeaning. People use crime and anti-social behaviour as a kind of \u2018gauge\u2019 of the health of a \ncommunity (Bannister, 1993). When an individual commits a crime or engages in anti-social \nbehaviour, that individual communicates hostility to the values and sense of order of the \ncommunity and damages its social fabric. Incidents of crime and disorder can suggest to an \nobserver that the community is suffering from deteriorating standards of behaviour, \ndiminishing power of informal social control, increasing diversification of norms and values, \nand decreasing levels of trust, reciprocity and respect. Because of such shared meaning, \npeople\u2019s evaluations of the state of the social environment, its sense of order and stability, \nshape their inferences about crime. These findings echo the work of Bannister (ibid.) that \n 16\nValidating New Measures of the Fear of Crime \n4\/26\/2010, page 17 \nargues that certain environmental conditions create fear because they represent a perceived \nthreat to an individual\u2019s sense of well-being and identity. \nThe fear of crime is thus shaped by a range of subjective interpretations of the social \nmeaning of crime and incivility embedded in the local context, the health of the community, \nand the sense of living in an ordered and trusting environment. Importantly, different people \nmake different interpretations of the same community: in a development of this model carried \nout in a rural part of the UK, interpretations of the social and physical environment were \nfound to be shaped by social values regarding long-term social change, authoritarianism and \nLaw and Order; those people who were concerned about changes in discipline, values and \nnorms were more likely to interpret young people hanging around as a threat to the social \norder of the community and thus potentially a threat to oneself (Jackson, 2004a).  \nSo what about debates about the rationality or proportionality of the fear of crime? \nDon\u2019t some people worry too much about crime? Isn\u2019t the fear of crime based on inaccurate \nbeliefs about crime? Why do people make inferences from incivilities and things seen to be \nhostile to social order to crime? Is this justified? Study after study have suggested that people, \nin general, do not have a particularly realistic sense of the incidence of crime, and particularly \nthe incidence of more serious and dramatic crimes.  \nThe current research suggests that many people see crime, anti-social behaviour and \nthe conditions conducive to crime to be strongly associated. Moreover, crime seems to be a \nlabel that people use to articulate the health of the social order \u2013 the extent to which people \nadhere to norms, values and morals, express commitment to the community and to civic \nstandards. Thus people use the language of crime and worry to articulate broader concerns \nabout cherished social conditions that are seen to be in flux: a way of seeing as much as a way \nof feeling. \nBut one can accept this yet also plausibly retain the option of assessing the \nproportionality of the fear of crime. How? Well, let us take an example. Some people may see \nthe young people who hang around their street as threatening and potentially criminal. The \nyoung people may be seen as hostile to the community, somehow not bound by particular \nnorms and constraints, of a culture that lacks respect for others, capable of acts of a criminal \nnature (Jackson, 2004c). Yet at the same time these young people may not have any criminal \nintention \u2013 when pressed, they might say they simply have nothing better to do. It could be \nthat worries about crime have meant that the observers are rather quick to interpret these \nyoung people as a source of crime and harassment. It may be that heightened emotion and \nsensational media reportage have resulted in members of the public making rapid interpretive \nleaps from the presence of certain people, or the occurrence of incivilities, to the possibility of \ncriminal activity. In a sense, \u2018crime\u2019 may have become a lens through which people \nunderstand and express their understanding of social order and diversity. This leads people to \n 17\nValidating New Measures of the Fear of Crime \n4\/26\/2010, page 18 \nbecome less trusting, quick to stereotype and stigmatise, and more willing to see any kind of \ndeviance or expression of different values and norms as threatening.  \nSo, how should the police respond? The notion of reassurance policing has much \npolitical currency at the moment, motivated by indications that, while crime rates are \ngenerally falling, fear of crime remains unchanged. Mirroring the \u2018signal crimes\u2019 perspective \ncurrently being applied in the National Reassurance Policing Programme (Innes and Fielding, \n2002; Innes et al 2004; Innes, 2004), this research suggests that tackling anti-social behaviour \nand other aspects that signal that social order and cohesion is deteriorating, may indeed \nremove some of the stimuli to public inferences about the crime problem \u2013 and therefore to \nfear. Visible policing such as foot patrols may also signal that the authorities are regaining \ncontrol over the environment \u2013 that the police are actively reinforcing and reasserting \ncommunity values and morals. This may reduce, among some members of the public, the \nsense that the community is disrupted, thus dampening down their inferences about the \nprevalence of crime. And a feedback mechanism may plausibly emerge: a reduction in \nanxiety about crime might result in some people become slightly more trusting, and less quick \nto infer threat and hostility in certain individuals or groups.  \nYet at the same time, just as research and mass media reports might promote the use \nof the lens of crime to make sense of social conditions, so it might be that, as the police \nengage more and more with issues of anti-social behaviour and incivility, so this encourages \nthe public to see certain people and certain behaviour using the frames of crime and legal \ncensure \u2013 as more dangerous than they might reasonably be thought to be. This might \naugment a trend of criminalisation and lack of tolerance, and contribute to processes of social \nexclusion4.  \nIf the police phrase their reassurance strategies with respect to \u2018order maintenance\u2019, \naiming to preserve the day-to-day social order, and responding to a public desire for more \nvisible signs of authority and social control, then perhaps the problem of criminalisation is \nless important. But important civic liberty issues remain at stake when state coercion is used \nto respond to individuals and behaviours merely because they cause nuisance, annoyance and \ninsecurity.  \nThe fear of crime is an abstract idea, an evocative and polysemic notion, frequently \nused yet rather difficult to precisely define. It is a concept of everyday language, used in \n                                                 \n4 Indeed, if criminologists accept this perspective \u2013 and perhaps do some soul-searching \u2013 it is \nreasonable to accept that fear of crime research has proven to be a crucial cog in the wheel of the \u2018fear \nof crime business\u2019, which includes sensational mass media coverage and high-profile \u2018popular \npunitive\u2019 political rhetoric from successive Governments and Oppositions (see Lee, 1999 and 2001).  \nThis business encourages the sense among the public that crime is a bigger problem than it is really is \n(particularly serious and dramatic types of crimes) and that many people are worried about crime, thus \nincreasing the tendency for people to use the dramatic metaphor of crime to make sense of diversity, \ndisorder and community conditions. \n 18\nValidating New Measures of the Fear of Crime \n4\/26\/2010, page 19 \nconversation and public debate to condense a number of inter-related social and political \nconcerns. And perhaps it is inevitable that the questionnaire fails to fully capture the detail. \nYet research is beginning to unpick one or two fascinating aspects of this phenomenon; \nimproved measures are beginning to emerge that reveal some of the richness that previously \nonly qualitative methods showed. The results have significant implications for debate and \npublic policy. But just as there remains scope to develop our conceptual and methodological \ntools, producing more nuanced and sensitive insights into this fascinating and politically \ncharged topic, there is equally a need to think carefully about the implications of the research \nwe are doing and how Governments and the police should respond in liberal and increasingly \ndiverse societies.  \n 19\nValidating New Measures of the Fear of Crime \n4\/26\/2010, page 20 \nAppendix \n \nThe first sub-set asked respondents about the frequency with which they have worried about \nbecoming a victim of 5 classes of victimisation in their neighbourhood during the previous \nmonth. The response alternatives were: \u2018not once in the last month\u2019; \u2018once or twice in the past \nmonth\u2019; \u2018once or twice in the past week\u2019; and \u2018every day\u2019.   \nSubjective estimates of probabilities were measured by asking respondents how likely \nthey thought it was that they would fall victim during the next twelve months. A seven-point \nscale was used with only the endpoints labelled: 1 = definitely not going to happen and 7 = \ncertain to happen. Perceptions of the seriousness of consequences were measured by asking \nrespondents the extent to which an experience of a typical instance of each category of \ncriminal victimisation would affect respondents\u2019 lives. The questions used seven-point \nresponse alternatives which were labelled at the endpoints: 1 = not at all; and 7 = to a very \ngreat extent. Perceived control was measured by asking respondents the extent to which they \nfelt able to control whether or not they became a victim of various crimes. Again, a seven-\npoint scale was used with only the endpoints labelled: 1 = not at all;  and 7 = to a very great \nextent.   \nOn incivilities, the items replicated a number of questions from the 2000 sweep of the \nBritish Crime Survey: (a) Vandalism\/graffiti; (b) Rubbish in the streets; (c) Dogs out of \ncontrol \/ creating a mess; (d) Drug-taking in the open; (e) Drinking in the street; (f) Teenagers \nhanging  around; and, (g) Not enough things for young people to do. \nThe second aspect of the physical and social environment was \u2018community cohesion\u2019, \ncomprising two related constructs: the extent to which respondents thought they lived in a \nfriendly, supportive and trusting community; and the levels of informal social control. These \nwere measured by four and three questions respectively, using a Likert scale ranging from 1 \n(being \u2018very strongly agree\u2019) to 5 (being \u2018very strongly disagree\u2019). The statements were: (a) \nThe people who live here can be relied upon to call the police if someone is acting \nsuspiciously; (b) If any of the children or young people around here are causing trouble, local \npeople will tell them off; (c) If I sensed trouble whilst in this area, I could raise attention from \npeople who live here for help; (d) This area has a close, tight-knit community; (e) This area is \na friendly place to live; (f) This area is a place where local people look after each other; and, \n(g) Most people who live in this area trust one another. \n 20\nValidating New Measures of the Fear of Crime \n4\/26\/2010, page 21 \nTable 1.
