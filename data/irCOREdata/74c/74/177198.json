It \ncan be a symptom of various disorders, however the \nmajority of OFP is due to dental causes (for example, \ntoothache) and facial trauma, and in most cases it is \nacute. The remainder is considered chronic OFP, and \ntemporomandibular disorders (TMD) represent one \nof the most common forms of chronic OFP. TMD is \na collective term, for disorders characterized by joint \npain, masticatory muscle tenderness, joint noises \nand restricted jaw movements. The percentage of the \npopulation presenting with TMD is estimated at 3 - 4%, \nhowever up to a quarter of the population may report \nthe symptoms during the past month [2,3].\nIt has been suggested that there is a relationship between \nthe removal of third molars and the postoperative onset \nof temporomandibular joint pain\/dysfunction. As early \nas 1969, Greene et al. [4] reported that 48% of patients \nwith TMD attributed the onset of their symptoms to \na specific event, including prolonged oral surgery \nprocedures. However there is equivocal evidence on a \nrelationship between TMD symptoms and third molars \nremoval: while some studies supported this finding [5-8], \nothers did not find any association [9-11]. These studies \ninvolved patient populations [4,9], university students \n[5,8], health plan enrolees [6,11] and dental service \nenrolees [7]. One study [10] involved cases diagnosed \nin clinic and controls from dental health survey. None of \nthe above studies were conducted in general population, \ni.e. they were all prone to selection bias as not all people \nwith OFP seek treatment and not everybody enrolled in \nhealth and dental plans. The general population will be \ndifferent from patients attending clinics. \nThe aim of the current study was to investigate whether \nthere was a relationship between a history of third molar \nremoval and the prevalence of orofacial pain in a sample \nof the general population.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nThe study was a four year follow-up of the population \nsurvey conducted by Macfarlane et al. [12]. The \noriginal survey included randomly selected participants \naged 18-65 years registered with a general medical \npractice in South East Cheshire, North West England. \nRandom selection ensured that the study population \ncould represent equally all genders, ages, ethnicities \nand social class. As general practice registers \ncover more than 99% of the population in England \n \n(http:\/\/www.statistics.gov.uk) and access to most health \nservice care is through the general medical practitioner, \nthe practice age-sex resister is a convenient frame for a \ngeneral population survey. \nEthical approval for the study was granted by South \nCheshire Local Research Ethics Committee. \nSample size for the baseline survey was calculated \nusing the results of a pilot study using OFP prevalence \nestimate of 25% [12]. Every participant in the main \nsurvey who gave permission to be contacted again was \nincluded in the follow-up survey (only 3 participants of \nthe baseline survey did not wish to be contacted again).\nEach participant received a postal questionnaire, with \nfollow-up of non-responders by a reminder postcard, \nquestionnaire and, if necessary, a short questionnaire \nand a telephone call. The questionnaire consisted \nof demographic, psychological, body pain and OFP \nsections. OFP was defined as present if participants \nduring the past month \u201chad any pain in their face, mouth \nor jaws that has lasted for one day or longer\u201d. Body \npain was defined as present if participants during the \npast month \u201chad any ache or pain in the body which \nhas lasted for one day or longer\u201d. Psychological distress \nwas measured using the 12-item version of the General \nHealth Questionnaire [13]. Deprivation was measured \nby the Townsend Index, an area-based score derived \nfrom postcode sectors or wards [14]. \nParticipants were also asked if they had their wisdom \nteeth removed and permission to be contacted again. In \naddition, participants were asked permission for their \ndental records to be examined, and in case of positive \nreply, were asked to indicate the name and address of \ntheir dentist.\nInformation from dental records was extracted by one of \ntwo clinical examiners. Information regarding number, \nposition and method of third molar removal was \nrecorded. Data were extracted in duplicate (both clinical \nexaminers) from 10 records to investigate reliability. \nOne clinical examiner repeated data extraction from 10 \ndental records twice to investigate reproducibility.\nThe magnitude of association between third molar \nremoval and OFP was described by the relative risk \n(RR). RR here is a measure of the risk of OFP in \none group compared to the risk of OFP in another \n(reference) group. A relative risk of one means there is \nno difference between two groups in terms of their risk \nof OFP. A relative risk of greater than one or of less \nthan one means that being exposed to a factor either \nincreases (relative risk greater than one) or decreases \n(relative risk less than one) the risk of OFP. Cox \nregression [15] was used to estimate RR adjusted for \npotential confounders. The data were analysed using \nStata 10 for Windows (StataCorp, LP, USA, 2008) \nand SPSS 16.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, \nhttp:\/\/www.ejomr.org\/JOMR\/archives\/2010\/3\/e4\/e4ht.htm  J Oral Maxillofac Res 2010 (Jul-Sep) | vol. 1 | No 3 | e4 | p.3\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nJOURNAL OF ORAL & MAXILLOFACIAL RESEARCH                                                           Macfarlane et al.\nIL, USA, 2008) statistical packages.\nRESULTS\nA total of 1680 persons (81% adjusted participation rate \nafter excluding those who were no longer registered \nwith the practice, deceased or who were not able to \ncomplete the questionnaire due to illness or disability or \nexpressed a wish at baseline not to be contacted again) \nparticipated in the follow-up survey, and the full study \nquestionnaire was completed by 1510 participants. The \nremainder completed a short version of the questionnaire \nwhich did not include question on third molar removal.\nAdjusted participation rate was higher in women (83%) \ncompared to men (77%) (Chi-square test P < 0.001) \nand in affluent areas (83%) compared to deprived areas \n(59%) (Chi-square test P < 0.001). Non-respondents \nwere older (mean age 49 years [SD = 12]) then non-\nrespondents (mean age 44 years [SD = 13]) (t-test P < \n0.001). \nOf those who completed the full questionnaire, 295 \n(19%) reported OFP, 1202 (80%) did not report such \npain and 13 (1%) did not answer this question. Majority \n(60%) of self-reported OFP was chronic, i.e. lasted for \nmore than 3 months. The mean pain severity was 4.8 on \n10-point numerical analogues scale (SD = 2.3) and 62% \nsought advice on OFP from a health professional.\nOver half (873, 58%) of respondents did not report a \nhistory of perceived third molar extractions, 77 (5%) \ndid not answer this question, giving 560 (37%) who \nreported third molar removal.\nThe majority of participants (1060, 70%) who \ncompleted the full questionnaire gave permission for \ntheir dental records to be examined, and indicated the \nname and address of their dentist. Eight hundred and \nsixty (81%) participants were registered with four main \ndental practices in the study area; the remainder were \nregistered with dentists in the surrounding areas. These \ndistant practices were not visited, so only these four \nmain practices were included, and 806 (94%) patient \nrecords were found. In addition, one practice in the \nsurrounding area with 3 patient records was used as \n a pilot site, giving total of 809 records. Median time of \nregistration with a dentist was 14 years (range 1 day - 46 \nyears) prior to completing the questionnaire.\nThere was an acceptable (Cohen\u2019s kappa > 0.6, P < \n0.05) agreement when reliability and reproducibility \nof information regarding third molars extracted from \ndental records. The minimum Cohen\u2019s kappa value was \n0.61, maximum 1.00, median was 0.71, indicating at \nleast substantial agreement, according to classification \nby Landis and Koch [16].\nTo validate the answers in the questionnaire regarding \nperceived third molar removal, this question was cross \ntabulated against the extractions recorded by dentists \n(Table 1). Of those who reported at least one perceived \nextraction, 20 (37%) had extractions recorded in dental \nrecords, while for those who did not report history of \nextractions in the questionnaire, this figure was 27 \n(6%). All four third molars were present in 113 (25%) \nof participants who did not report extractions. Only 9 \n(3%) of participants who reported that they had third \nmolars removed had all four third molars present.\nParticipants who reported third molar extractions in the \nquestionnaire were more likely to report OFP (adjusted \nRelative Risk [RR] 1.29); (95% confidence interval \n[CI] 1.01 - 1.65) (Table 2). When only information \nfrom the dental records was used and participants \nwith all four molars present were compared to those \nwith at least one extraction, the RR was 1.50 (95% CI \n0.90 - 2.49). However when time since last extraction was \ninvestigated, the increase was evident only in relatively \nrecent extractions (RR = 1.91, 95% CI 1.10 - 3.32) \nfor people with third molar extraction less than eight \nand a half years ago, whilst the number of third molars \nremaining did not show any particular pattern.\nDISCUSSION\nThis population-based epidemiological study has \nprovided evidence that individuals who report third \nmolar extractions are more likely to report OFP. When \nextraction information was validated using dental \nrecords, this association was only found in relatively \nTable 1.

The incidence of \nTMD has been shown to rise after 19 years of age. It \nhas been suggested that this could be attributed to \nocclusal changes as a consequence of teeth exfoliation \nand eruption of permanent successors, or the eruption \nof third molars leading to overcrowded dental arches \n[18,19]. Third molar removal could lead to TMD \ndevelopment as a consequence of the required surgery, \nwhich may necessitate wide mouth opening and the \napplication of relatively large forces to the posterior \nmandible. Traumatic arthritis has been reported after \nthird molar removal although the occurrence is rare \n[20]. TMD patients with a history of trauma or non-\ntemporomandibular joint-related operations have \nreported higher prevalence, severity and frequency \nof OFP than controls [21,22]. It has been postulated \nthat nerve damage in hard and soft tissues can cause \nsensitisation of both peripheral and central neurons [9]. \nHypothetically, the increased pain perception following \nsurgical third molar removal could tip the threshold \nbalance toward TMD. \nThere are methodological issues which need to be \nconsidered when examining the study results. \nThe study involves a sample of the population of one \ngeographic area in the United Kingdom and therefore \nmay not be representative. While the overall participation \nrate at follow-up was high, non-participants were more \nlikely to be male, younger and from lower socio-\neconomic background. \nNevertheless, these differences would only affect the \ncomparisons in the present study if the relationship \nbetween these factors and presence of OFP were \ndifferent in those subjects who participated compared \nwith those who did not.

A reply paid envelope was \nenclosed. Posters about the study were placed in the \nmedical practice. Non-respondents were followed up \nby a postcard reminder, a further questionnaire, and, if \nnecessary, a short questionnaire and a telephone call.\nAlthough there was a statistically significant increase \nin risk (30%) of OFP associated with self-reported \nextractions, we did not find a statistically significant \nassociation between at least one third molar extraction \ndetermined from the dental records and OFP (50% \nincreased risk). Firstly, there was less statistical power \nwhen information from dental records was analysed, as \nnot all participants who completed the questionnaire \nhad information from dental records. Secondly, \nindividual perception may play role in this discrepancy. \nHowever we have adjusted in the statistical analysis in \nboth cases for other potential risk factors such as other \nbody pain and psychological distress. Thirdly, it has \nbeen shown that that there was good correspondence \nbetween subjective self-reports of well-defined oral \nhealth conditions and clinical findings, for example \nthe number of teeth and the presence of dentures [23]. \nFinally, there was a statistically significant increase in \nrisk among participants with more recent extractions, \nwhich support the findings of Huang and Rue, who also \nfound elevated risk in more recent extractions [7].\nWhile the study has achieved high participation rate and \nacceptable reliability when extracting information from \ndental records, several problems were encountered. \nAlthough participants had reported third molar removal \nin the original questionnaire, it may not be entirely \naccurate. For approximately half of all cases, third \nmolars were marked as absent in the records but with \nno record of extraction. It was impossible to determine \nfrom the notes whether third molars marked as absent \nin this way were: 1) congenitally absent; 2) unerupted; \n3) had been extracted before the origin of the notes. \nThis problem was accentuated in the older age groups, \nwhere early dental records were not available. Another \nissue was inconsistent charting of third molars. In rare \ncases it was obvious that after early extraction of first \nmolars, third molars were being recorded. In some \ncases charting of the tooth could change several times \nthroughout the notes. Better recording of dental notes \nwould help resolve some of these problems in primary \ndental care research. In addition, this study is a cross-\nsectional survey and therefore the associations we \nreport are not necessarily causal. \nCONCLUSIONS\nThis research has shown that there is a weak relationship \nbetween self-reported history of third molar removal \nand self-reported orofacial pain, and the depth and \ndetail of evidence is still inconclusive. \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND DISCLOSURE \nSTATEMENTS\nThe authors are grateful to staff and patients of \nLawton House Surgery, dental practice of AR Mellor \n& Associates, Canal Street Dental Practice, Moody \nTerrace Dental Practice and TDU Miller dental practice \nin Congleton, Cheshire, United Kingdom for their help \nwith the study.
