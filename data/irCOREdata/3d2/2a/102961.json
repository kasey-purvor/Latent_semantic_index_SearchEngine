Lanham-New\nNutritional Sciences Division, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Surrey, Guildford,\nSurrey GU2 7XH, UK\nThroughout the life cycle the skeleton requires optimum development and maintenance of its\nintegrity to prevent fracture. Bones break because the loads placed on them exceed the ability\nof the bone to absorb the energy involved. It is now estimated that one in three women and one\nin twelve men aged >55 years will suffer from osteoporosis in their lifetime and at a cost in the\nUK of >\u00a31.7 \u00b7 109 per year. The pathogenesis of osteoporosis is multifactorial. Both the\ndevelopment of peak bone mass and the rate of bone loss are determined by key endogenous\nand exogenous factors. Ca supplements appear to be effective in reducing bone loss in women\nlate post menopause (>5 years post menopause), particularly in those with low habitual Ca\nintake (<400 mg\/d). In women early post menopause (<5 years post menopause) who are not\nvitamin D deficient, Ca supplementation has little effect on bone mineral density. However,\nsupplementation with vitamin D and Ca has been shown to reduce fracture rates in the insti-\ntutionalised elderly, but there remains controversy as to whether supplementation is effective in\nreducing fracture in free-living populations. Re-defining vitamin D requirements in the UK is\nneeded since there is evidence of extensive hypovitaminosis D in the UK. Low vitamin D\nstatus is associated with an increased risk of falling and a variety of other health outcomes and\nis an area that requires urgent attention. The role of other micronutrients on bone remains to be\nfully defined, although there are promising data in the literature for a clear link between\nvitamin K nutrition and skeletal integrity, including fracture reduction.\nOsteoporosis: Fracture: Vitamin D: Calcium: Vitamin K\nBones break because the loads placed on them exceed their\nability to absorb the energy involved(1). This outcome is\nlikely to be the result of a number of factors including, but\nnot limited to: a reduction in bone mass; a change in the\ndistribution of bone; loss of cancellous or cortical micro-\narchitecture; an accumulation of damaged bone; a change\nin the material properties of the remaining bone(2).\nBone is a living tissue. There is a continuous cycle of\nactive bone formation (through the activity of osteocytes\nand osteoblasts) and bone resorption (involving osteo-\nclasts). Fig. 1 shows the sequence of events in the bone\nremodelling sequence. Osteoclasts are attracted to a\nquiescent bone surface and then excavate an erosion\ncavity. Mononuclear cells smooth off the erosion cavity,\nwhich is a subsequent site for the attraction of osteoblasts\nthat synthesise an osteoid matrix. Continuous new bone\nmatrix synthesis is followed by calcification of the newly-\nformed bone. When complete, lining cells once more\noverlie the trabecular surface(3).\nOsteoporosis is defined as a metabolic bone disease\n\u2018characterised by low bone mass and microarchitectural\ndeterioration of bone tissue, leading to enhanced bone\nfragility and a consequent increase in fracture risk\u2019(4,5).\nThere is a normal mineral:collagen, unlike that of other\nmetabolic bone diseases such as osteomalacia (which\nis characterised by deficiencies of mineral relative to\ncollagen)(6).

There are >230 000 osteoporotic\nfractures occurring every year in the UK at a cost of\n>\u00a31.7 \u00b7 109 per year.

Furthermore, the WHO\nhas projected a rise in osteoporotic fractures from\n1.66 \u00b7 106 hip fractures in 1990 to 6.26 \u00b7 106 in the 2050,\nwhich suggests that the future economic impact of osteo-\nporosis will be enormous(10).\nChanges in bone mass with ageing\nConsiderable changes in skeletal mass occur during the life\ncycle. Adult bone health is predominantly determined by\nthree key factors: the maximum attainment of peak bone\nmass, which is achieved during growth and early adulthood;\nmaintaining bone mass in adulthood; reducing the rate of\nbone loss with advancing age, with the menopausal years\nbeing a time of considerable concern for women (Fig. 3)(11).\nBoth peak bone mass attainment in the younger population\nand the rate of bone loss in post-menopausal women and\nthe elderly are determined by key endogenous and exo-\ngenous factors, i.e. a combination of genetic, endocrine,\nmechanical and nutritional factors(12), with evidence of\nextensive interactions within and between these groups.\nCalcium nutrition: important concepts\nCa is the most abundant mineral in the body(13). Approxi-\nmately 1.2 kg (equivalent to about 300 mmol) is contained\nwithin the human body, with 99% of this Ca being located\nwithin the bones and teeth. Ca is also located in body fluids\nand soft tissues. It has two key roles: (1) supporting\nstructural integrity; (2) regulating metabolic function(14).\nCa is essential for: cellular structure; intercellular and\nintracellular metabolic function; signal transmission;\nmuscle contractions, including heart muscle; nerve func-\ntion; activities of enzymes; normal clotting of blood. There\nis no functional marker of Ca status, since its role in\nnormal blood clotting takes priority and hence plasma Ca\nis maintained within very narrow limits (Fig. 4)(15).\nCa metabolism\nCa absorption occurs predominantly in the jejunum and\nalso in the ileum and colon. Uptake occurs by active\ntransport and simple passive diffusion. At low Ca intakes\nactive transport predominates, but as intakes increase more\nis absorbed by non-specific pathways(16). The metabolite of\nvitamin D (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol) stimulates Ca\ntransport across the intestinal cells by inducing the pro-\nduction of a Ca-binding protein. This process occurs within\nthe villus cells through the normal process of receptor\nbinding, DNA interaction and messenger RNA production.\nHence, vitamin D is critical for effective Ca absorption(17).\nCa is lost mainly through renal excretion but there are\ndata to also support losses occurring via faeces, sweat, skin\nand hair, as well as nails. Ca enters the gut via the bile,\nwhich is known to be relatively rich in Ca. It also enters\nthe gut in pancreatic secretions and as part of desquamated\ncells from the mucosal lining. It may also be reabsorbed\nfrom the ileum and colon. As a result of the endogenous\nsecretion the net absorption is less than gross dietary\nabsorption by approximately 100 mg. Plasma Ca is tightly\nmaintained at a level of 90\u2013105 mg\/l, of which approxi-\nmately 50% is ionised. The plasma ionised Ca compart-\nment is maintained by a combination of humeral factors\nthat regulate intestinal absorption, renal loss and deposition\nor mobilisation of Ca from bone(18).\nUrinary Ca excretion\nApproximately 97% of the filtered Ca load is re-absorbed\nby the renal tubules and the remaining 3%, which is\nBo\nne\n M\nas\ns\nAttainment of PBM\nMen\nWomen\n0 10 20 30\nAge (years)\n40 50 60 70\nAge-related bone lossConsolidation\nFig. 3. Changes in bone mass during the life cycle. Critical times are: (1) attainment of peak\nbone mass (PBM; 0\u201328 years of age, with pubertal years being particularly crucial); (2) meno-\npause ( ; during the menopause and \u00a3 10 years post menopause it is estimated that 1\u20132% of\nbone is lost per year); (3) age-related bone loss (a low bone mineral density threshold increases\nosteoporosis fracture risk).\nDiet and bone health 165\nP\nro\nce\ned\nin\ngs\no\nf\nth\ne\nN\nu\ntr\nit\nio\nn\nSo\nci\net\ny\nexcreted in urine, represents the obligatory loss. The major\ndeterminant of urinary Ca excretion is dietary Ca intake.\nUrinary Ca excretion is higher when protein and Na\nintakes are high than when intakes of these two nutrients\nare low. The effects of a high protein intake on Ca excre-\ntion may be partly offset by higher P intake. Urinary Ca\nexcretion decreases in old age with glomerular filtration\nrate. Also, intestinal absorption declines as the result of a\nreduction in the efficiency of parathyroid hormone and\nvitamin D metabolism. Increased urinary Ca in women at\nthe menopause reflects the increased mobilisation of bone\nCa because of oestrogen deficiency(19).\nControl of Ca balance\nAn adult on a normal mixed diet is usually in a state of\nequilibrium, i.e. the amount lost in the faeces and urine is\napproximately equal to the amount present in the food. In\ngrowing children the body is normally in positive balance.\nCa is steadily maintained for the formation of new bone.\nWhen the need of the bones is great the net absorption of\ndietary Ca via the intestinal mucosa can be much greater\nthan normal. The main features of Ca balance include a\nmiscible pool mainly in blood and extracellular fluids,\nwhich provides for the slow turnover in bones. The pool is\nreplenished by dietary Ca and losses occur in urine.\nIt is very important to note that the concentration of\nplasma Ca is finely regulated and controls the size of the\npool. Ca balance is hence actively controlled by a large\nnumber of factors. The external balance of Ca (the differ-\nence between intake and output) is, in effect, determined\nby the exchange between the skeleton, the intestine and\nthe kidney. These fluxes are controlled by the action\nof calciotrophic hormones: parathyroid hormone; 1,25-\ndihydroxycholecalciferol; calcitonin. It is also influenced\nby other factors such as sex hormones, growth hormones,\ncorticosteroids and a variety of locally-acting hormones\n(Fig. 4)(20).\nWithin bone, Ca is in the form of hydroxyapatite\ncrystals (Ca10 (PO4)6 (OH)2), which also contain P and Mg,\nand contributes to its strength. P is found in abundance in a\nvariety of foods but Mg is more limited and is an area of\nbone health nutrition that requires further attention.\nCalcium and peak bone mass development\nPeak bone mass is one of the key factors determining bone\nmass and fracture risk later in life. Attaining a high peak\nbone mass within an individual\u2019s genetic potential is a\nkey preventative strategy for fracture reduction. Hence,\nthe focus of research must be more fully directed on\nmodifiable factors affecting the peak attainment of bone. It\nis known that genetic factors do play a key role in the\nvariation of peak bone mass, with estimates of approxi-\nmately 70\u201375%(21), which still leaves plenty of room for\nkey exogenous factors such as diet and physical activity to\nplay a key role in bone mass development.\nThe length of time peak mass is maintained before age-\nrelated bone loss begins is approximately 28 years of age.\nThere are some studies that indicate that the duration is\nrelatively brief and others that indicate it may last several\nyears. This disparity appears to depend on the skeletal\nregion examined(22), and is likely to become clearer as\nmore longitudinal studies are published. There are data,\nhowever, to show that both Ca absorption and bone Ca\nActive absorbtion\n1,25 (OH)2D3\nDietary Ca\nSmall intestine\nLarge intestine\nParathyroid\nhormone\n1,25 (OH)2D3\nUrinary Ca\nCalcitonin\nKidney\nParathyroid\nhormone\n1,25 (OH)2D3\nCalcitonin\nBone\nVitamin D\nBlood Ca\nTotal: 90\u2013110 mg\/l\nProtein bound: 36\u201344 mg\/l\nLigand bound: 6\u201312 mg\/l\nCa   ions: 44\u201352 mg\/l\nFig. 4.

There are some studies\nthat indicate that adolescent girls are less likely than boys\nto meet the current recommended dietary levels for Ca\n(although under-reporting may be a key confounding factor\nin these studies)(24).\nClinical trials with Ca supplements in both children and\nteenagers have shown an overall positive effect of Ca on\nbone mass accrual. The effect has been shown to be\nbetween 1 and 6% per year in the total body and between 1\nand 10% per year at different specific skeletal regions\nwhen compared with a placebo(25). However, the studies\nhave only been of short duration (between 1 and 3 years).\nPubertal stage is critical in relation to the effectiveness of\nthe supplement. For example, a study of adolescent girls\npost menarche (<15.5 years of age) who had baseline low\nCa intakes (<800 mg\/d) has shown enhanced bone mineral\nacquisition in those girls given a 1000 mg\/d supplement in\ncomparison with girls given a placebo(26). The effect was\nobserved to be especially evident in girls who were >2\nyears past the onset of menarche.\nIn a follow-up study to a 3.5-year Ca supplementation\ntrial in ninety-six adolescent girls multivariate analysis has\nrevealed that total-body bone mineral density (BMD)\naccrual over the 7 years (original and follow-up study) in\nthe active-treatment cohort is attributable to Ca supple-\nmentation(27). A further 8-year follow-up study of Ca sup-\nplementation in girls who were prepubertal has suggested\nthat prepubertal Ca intake may also have an effect on the\ntiming of menarche(28). The areal BMD gain between 7.9\nand 16.4 years of age was found to be inversely related to\nmenarcheal age at the axial and appendicular skeletal sites.\nA significant difference was observed between groups in\nrelation to menarcheal age, with girls in the Ca-supple-\nmented group starting menarche approximately 5 months\nsooner. On subgroup analysis based on menarcheal age it\nwas found that the mean areal BMD gain from baseline in\ngirls whose menarcheal age was below the median (13\nyears) remained significantly greater at all sites measured.\nIn the late-menarche subgroup no lasting effect of Ca\nsupplementation on BMD was observed. The authors\nsuggest that Ca supplementation in prepubertal girls may\naccelerate the onset of pubertal maturation.\nThese data indicate the importance of Ca to peak bone\nmass development, although further research is clearly\nrequired to identify the exact mechanisms of an effect of\nincreased Ca on pubertal timing(29).\nCalcium and physical activity interactions: effects on\npeak bone mass attainment\nOver 100 years ago, the German scientist Julius Wolff\nproposed the theory that is known as \u2018Wolff\u2019s Law\u2019: \u2018bone\naccommodates the forces applied to it by altering its\namount and distribution of mass\u2019(30). More recently, this\nconcept has been refined to a general theory of bone mass\nregulation, known as the mechanostat model(31). It is well\nknown that in the absence of weight-bearing exercise bone\nloss will occur at both axial and appendicular skeletal sites.\nA 3-year longitudinal investigation has shown consistently\nhigher bone mineral content in young girls regularly\nundertaking weight-bearing exercise in comparison with\nhealthy controls, despite late age of menarche or amenor-\nrhoea (Fig. 5)(32). Controlled intervention studies provide\nstronger evidence that effects of activity are causal and can\nbe attained in less-active children who start to exercise\n(Fig. 6(33)). Several such studies have examined the effects\nof exercise interventions on bone in children, with BMD or\nbone mineral content gains in the order of 1\u20135% greater in\nthe exercise-intervention group than in the control\ngroups(33,34). Structural adaptation also seems to occur,\nincluding increases in bone area, bone circumference and\nbone width.\nThere are increasing data to suggest that both Ca and\nphysical activity work synergistically on the skeleton(35). A\nrandomised controlled trial in young children (3\u20135 years)\nhas shown that exercise increases leg bone mineral content\nin children receiving a Ca supplement (1000 mg\/d) but not\nin those receiving a placebo(36). Cortical thickness and area of\nthe tibia have also been found to increase in response to\nactivity in children taking Ca, but to decline in those\n800\n1200\n1600\n2000\n2400\n2800\n\u20134 \u20133 \u20132 \u20131 0 1 2 3\nBiological age\nTB\n B\nM\nC \n(g)\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nFig. 5.

Similar results have also been reported\nfor older children (7\u201311 years); greater leg bone mineral\naccrual was found with a combination of a Ca supplement\n(800 mg\/d) and exercise compared with either treatment\nalone(37). Hence, adequate Ca intake may be essential for\noptimal skeletal response to exercise and exercise might\nenhance effects of Ca at weight-bearing sites(38).\nCalcium and post-menopausal bone loss\nThere are now good data to show that Ca supplements are\neffective in reducing bone loss in women late post meno-\npause (>5 years post menopause), particularly in those\nwith low habitual Ca intake (<400 mg\/d)(39). A key study\nhas shown that women late post menopause have a sig-\nnificant reduction in lumbar spine and femoral neck bone\nloss following supplementation with 500 mg Ca\/d, with no\nsuch effect in women early post menopause (<5 years post\nmenopause)(40) (Table 1). A review of over twenty studies\nhas shown that Ca supplementation can decrease bone loss\nby approximately 1% per year(41) and a meta-analysis\nthat included fifteen trials indicates that Ca supplemen-\ntation at levels between 500 and 2000 mg\/d reduces post-\nmenopausal bone loss(42); Ca changes were of the order of\n1.66% at the lumbar spine and 1.64% at the hip. There are\nsome data to suggest that the effect of Ca supplementation\nmay be greater at skeletal sites with more cortical\nbone(43,44). There are also data to suggest that Ca supple-\nmentation improves the efficacy of antiresorptive therapy\non bone mass(45).\nVitamin D nutrition: key concepts\nTypes of vitamin D\nVitamin D is the generic term for two molecules, i.e.\nergocalciferol (vitamin D2) and cholecalciferol (vitamin D3).\nErgocalciferol is derived by UV irradiation of ergosterol,\nwhich is found in fungi and plants(46). Cholecalciferol is\nformed from the effect of UV irradiation on the skin and\nthe efficiency of cholecalciferol synthesis is dependent on\nthe number of UVB photons that penetrate into the epi-\ndermis. As shown in Fig. 7, the action of sunlight on the\nskin converts 7-dehydrocholesterol to previtamin D, which\nis metabolised to vitamin D by a temperature-dependent\nisomerisation. Vitamin D is then transported via the\ngeneral circulation to the liver, where the enzyme 25-\nhydroxylase converts it to 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25\nOHD). The kidney is the site for further conversion to\n1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. 25 OHD is the best indi-\ncator of clinical status and is the key circulating vitamin D\nmetabolite(47). 1,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol is the active\nform of the vitamin, which is involved in Ca homeostasis,\nhelping to maintain normal blood levels of Ca and P and\npromoting Ca absorption and bone mineralisation(48).\nSources of vitamin D\nIt is believed that the main source of vitamin D is the UV\nin sunlight. However, whether UV exposure is sufficient\nFig. 6. An example of a jumping programme that improves hip and\nlumbar spine bone mass in prepubescent children.

With a reduced\nzenith angle of the sun and increased path length of sun-\nlight through the atmosphere, the effective level of\nUV energy decreases north\u2013south with distance from the\nseasonally-varying latitude at which the sun is directly\noverhead(54). Hence, in areas of northern latitude (such as\nthe UK) there is no UV radiation of the appropriate\nwavelength (280 mm\u2013310 mm) from the end of October to\nthe end of March. For the remaining months of the year the\nmain percentage of the effective UV radiation occurs\nbetween 11.00 hours and 15.00 hours(55).\nA number of factors affect vitamin D production from\nUV exposure: (1) sunscreens absorb UVB radiation when\napplied to the skin; hence, there is marked reduction in the\npenetration of UVB photons into the epidermis and as a\nresult production of pre-cholecalciferol is markedly\nreduced; (2) glass absorbs all UVB photons and hence\nexposure of the skin from sunlight that has passed through\nglass will not promote cholecalciferol synthesis in the skin;\n(3) clothing also absorbs UVB radiation and so no chole-\ncalciferol is made in the skin covered by clothing; hence,\nwomen who cover up for cultural reasons are vitamin D\ndeficient and this factor represents an area of research that\nrequires urgent attention.\nAs shown in Table 2, there are few dietary sources of\nvitamin D. The major providers are fat spreads (which\nare fortified with vitamin D), fish, eggs, pastry products,\nfortified breakfast cereals and meat(56). Recent changes in EU\nregulations have resulted in a number of cereal manu-\nfacturers removing the vitamin D fortification(57). Key\nFood Standards Agency-funded research on the interaction\nbetween diet and sunlight exposure on vitamin D status is\ncurrently underway and results will provide core inform-\nation on vitamin D requirements(58).\nImportance of vitamin D to bone\nVitamin D stimulates bone matrix formation and bone\nmaturation. It also enhances osteoclastic activity and there\nare some data to suggest that it may influence different-\niation of bone cell precursors(59). Together with para-\nthyroid hormone, it regulates Ca and P metabolism and\npromotes Ca absorption from the gut and kidney\ntubules(60). It has been shown that fractional Ca absorption\nincreases with serum 25 OHD concentrations within the\nreference range, up to a level of 80 nmol\/l, reaching a\nplateau above that level(61).\nVitamin D and peak bone mass development\nThere is growing evidence that mild vitamin D insuffi-\nciency can have a detrimental effect on bone mineral mass\nin adolescent females(62) and children(63,64). A 3-year pro-\nspective cohort study in 171 healthy Finnish girls aged\n9\u201315 years comparing subjects with severe hypovit-\naminosis D (25 OHD <20 nmol\/l) with those with normal\nvitamin D status (25 OHD \u202137.5 nmol\/l) has found a dif-\nference of 4% in BMD accrual(64). The adjusted change in\nWinter Spring Summer Fall\nFig. 8.

Interestingly, the findings\nwere reported to be significant only for girls at the post-\npubertal stage, with no differences for girls of less maturity\n(<12 years); a finding that has been reported previously(65).\nLow vitamin D status is a risk factor for attaining a\nreduced peak bone mass(66).\nIn a key vitamin D-supplementation study on bone\nmineral accretion in 212 adolescent girls who were Ca\nreplete (mean age 11.4 years) bone mineral augmentation\nat the femur was found to be 14.3 and 17.2% higher in the\ngroups receiving the vitamin D supplementation (at either\n5mg\/d or 10mg\/d) in comparison with the placebo\ngroup(67). The findings followed a dose\u2013response relation-\nship for those subjects who were Ca replete. A difference\nwas also seen for lumbar spine bone density between the\ngroup supplemented at 10mg\/d level and the placebo\ngroup. Furthermore, vitamin D supplementation was found\nto significantly reduce bone resorption (as assessed by\nurinary deoxypyridinoline excretion). These findings were\nonly observed to be significant when the data were ana-\nlysed by the compliance-based method (which includes\nonly participants who complied with instructions) as\nopposed to the intention-to-treat method (which includes\nall participants who entered the trial). Further research is\nrequired on the combined effect of Ca and vitamin D on\nmaximising peak bone mass attainment, particularly in\nchildren accustomed to a low Ca intake.\nCalcium and vitamin D in fracture prevention\nCa and vitamin D supplementation studies have been\nshown to reduce fracture rates in institutionalised elderly\nindividuals(68). Women living in nursing homes in France\nwere given a 1200 mg Ca supplement and 20mg vitamin D\ndaily for a period of 18 months. Both hip fracture\n(P = 0.040) and non-vertebral fractures (P = 0.015) were\nshown to be significantly reduced in those women on the\nactive treatment in comparison with the placebo (Fig. 9).\nThere are also data to suggest an effect of Ca and\nvitamin D on fracture prevention in free-living elderly\npopulations. Elderly American men and women (mean age\n71 years) given 500 mg Ca and 20mg cholecalciferol daily\nwere found to have a reduced total number of non-\nvertebral fractures(69). In a factorial cluster-randomised\npragmatic intervention study of 9605 community-dwelling\nresidents living in a northern European region (Denmark) a\ndaily supplement of CaCO3 (1000 mg) and vitamin D\n(10mg) over a period of 3 years was reported to result\nin a 16% reduction in fracture incidence rate (relative\nrisk 0.84 (95% CI 0.72, 0.98) in treated subjects compared\nwith those subjects who were offered no supplement but\nparticipated in an environmental and health programme(70).\nVitamin D supplementation alone is not effective\nin preventing fractures in the elderly if the dosage is\nlimited. For example, a supplementation trial undertaken in\nNorway using cod liver oil that provided 10mg vitamin D\/d\nwas not found to prevent osteoporotic fractures in 1144\nnursing home residents(71). It is important to note that a\nrecent meta-analysis indicates that 17.5\u201320mg\/d reduces\nthe risk of hip and any non-vertebral fractures in ambu-\nlatory or institutionalised elderly individuals, but 10mg\/d is\nnot effective(72).\nA recently published study examining the effect of three\ninjections of 7500mg cholecalciferol per year has found no\nreduction in fracture risk in 9000 healthy ambulatory\nelderly men and women and, if anything, has shown that\nthe vitamin D supplementation increased the risk of frac-\nture (P<0.06)(73). This finding contrasts with the results of\na study of elderly British men and women aged 65\u201385\nyears in which it was shown that supplementation with\n2500mg cholecalciferol orally every fourth month for 5\nyears reduces the number of fractures of the hip, wrist,\nforearm and spine by 22% compared with placebo(74).\nTwo key UK studies have not demonstrated a positive\neffect of Ca and vitamin D supplementation on fracture\nprevention in the free-living elderly population(75,76).\nIn a pragmatic open randomised trial conducted with\n3314 women aged \u2021 70 years who had risk factors for\nhip fracture Ca (1000 mg\/d) and cholecalciferol (20mg\/d)\nTable 2.

In the MRC-Record trial involving\n5292 men and women aged \u2021 70 years who were mobile\nbefore developing a low-trauma fracture, 1000 mg Ca and\n20mg vitamin D, either alone or in combination, was not\nfound to significantly reduce the incidence of new low-\ntrauma fractures after 2 years(76). It is important to note,\nhowever, that compliance was again low in this study\n(possibly as low as 45% when non-responders to the\nquestionnaire were included) and only a small number of\nsubjects were measured for vitamin D status(77).\nThe 2005 Cochrane review has reported a reduced risk\nfor hip fracture (relative risk 0.81 (95% CI 0.68, 0.96) for\nseven trials) and non-vertebral fractures (relative risk 0.87\n(95% CI 0.78, 0.97) for seven trials) but no significant\neffect on vertebral fractures(78). The authors conclude that\nthe effect may be restricted to those living in institutional\ncare. The most recent meta-analysis of the effect of Ca and\nvitamin D supplements on fracture prevention suggests an\noverall positive effect(79).\nVitamin K nutrition and bone\nVitamin K (\u2018koagulation vitamin\u2019) was first described as\na dietary-derived coagulation factor(80); it was noted that a\nbleeding disorder in chickens was corrected by feeding a\nvariety of vitamin K-rich diets. The fat-soluble vitamin\nwas finally isolated in 1939(81). Vitamin K refers to a\nfamily of compounds with a common chemical structure,\n2-methyl-1,4 napthoquinone, as shown in Fig. 10. Phyllo-\nquinone (vitamin K1) is present in foods of plant origin.\nBacterial forms of vitamin K, referred to as the mena-\nquinones (vitamin K2) differ in structure from phyllo-\nquinone(82).\nVitamin K has an important function for the skeleton as\nit acts as a cofactor in the post-translational carboxylation\nof several bone proteins, with osteocalcin being the most\nabundant(83). Deficiency of vitamin K results in the syn-\nthesis of under-carboxylated osteocalcin(84). There are data\nto show that low serum concentrations of either phyllo-\nquinone or under-carboxylated osteocalcin are associated\nwith low BMD and increased risk for osteoporotic frac-\nture(85).\nA number of recently published studies suggest a key\nrole for vitamin K nutrition for optimisation of bone\nhealth(86). Phylloquinone supplementation (at a dose of\n200mg\/d, which would be obtainable in the diet from a\n50 g portion of green leafy vegetables) in combination with\nCa (1000 mg) and vitamin D (10mg) was investigated over a\n2-year period in a randomised placebo-controlled study (87).\nSubjects who took the combined phylloquinone and\nPhylloquinone (K1)\nPlant derived    \nLipid soluble    \nBacterially derived\nLipid soluble\nSynthetic\nWater soluble\nisoprenyl group\nphytyl group\nCH2-CH=C-CH2[-CH2-CH2-CH-CH2]3\nMenaquinones (K2)\nMenadione (K3)\nCH3\n[CH2-CH=C-CH2]\nCH3\nn 1\u201314\nCH3\nCH3\nCH3\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nCH2\nFig. 10.

The effect of phylloquinone (at a higher dose of\n1 mg\/d) on BMD has been studied in 155 healthy post-\nmenopausal women aged 50\u201360 years of age over 36\nmonths(88). The study examined the potential comple-\nmentary effect on post-menopausal bone loss of phyllo-\nquinone, vitamin D (8mg\/d) and a mineral supplement\n(including 150 mg Mg\/d, 500 mg Ca\/d and 10 mg Zn\/d).\nThe results indicate a positive effect of the phylloquinone\nsupplement on bone loss at the femoral neck, leading to a\n35% reduction in bone loss when compared with placebo\nafter a period of 36 months.\nMenaquinone supplementation has also been shown to\neffectively improve markers of bone health, although it is\nimportant to note that the doses of menaquinones used\ncould not be achieved via the diet(89). A recent meta-\nanalysis examining the effect of menaquionone supple-\nmentation on vertebral and hip fracture shows a convincing\neffect of pharmacological doses of menaquinones on\nfracture rate (Fig. 11(a and b))(90,91). The role of vitamin K\non prevention (and possibly treatment) of osteoporosis is\nan exciting area that requires further research.\nConcluding remarks\nIt is widely recognised that there are genetic, environ-\nmental, lifestyle and dietary determinants of risk of osteo-\nporotic fracture, as well as interactions between them.\nFavours vitamin K Favours control\nOR\n0\u00b705 0\u00b71 0\u00b72 0\u00b75 1 2 5 10 20\nStudy\n(a)\n(b)\nOR % Weight\nSasaki et al.(96) 0\u00b735 2\u00b79\nShiraki et al.(97) 0\u00b739 54\u00b74\nIwamoto et al.(98) 0\u00b732 10\u00b74\nIshida & Kawai(99) 0\u00b747 32\u00b73\nOverall 0\u00b740 100\u00b70\n Favours vitamin K Favours control\n0\u00b705 0\u00b71 0\u00b72 0\u00b75 1\nOR\n2 5 10 20\nStudy\nSato et al.(100) 0\u00b736 6\u00b74\nShiraki et al.(97) 0\u00b726 9\u00b77\nSato et al.(101) 0\u00b719 27\u00b71\nIshida & Kawai(99) 0\u00b737 6\u00b75\nSato et al.(102) 0\u00b718 50\u00b73\nOverall 0\u00b721 100\u00b70\n0\u00b702, 6\u00b700\n0\u00b720, 0\u00b775\n0\u00b707, 1\u00b746\n0\u00b720, 1\u00b710\n0\u00b725, 0\u00b765\n95% CI\nOR % Weight95% CI\n0\u00b702, 5\u00b790\n0\u00b703, 2\u00b755\n0\u00b705, 0\u00b775\n0\u00b702, 5\u00b790\n0\u00b707, 0\u00b749\n0\u00b710, 0\u00b743\nFig. 11.

Given that\nby the year 2030 one in four of the adult population will\nbe elderly, it is vital that special attention is given to\nnutritional strategies for the optimisation of bone health\nthroughout the life cycle, including the role of diet\nin reducing falls(92). Ca and vitamin D are clearly key\nnutrients for optimal bone health. At all costs, suboptimal\nintakes or status must be prevented and dietary vitamin D\nfortification should be considered for vulnerable groups\nsuch as older adults, post-menopausal women, adolescent\nfemales and amenorrhoeic women. Ca and vitamin D have\nbeen shown to be effective strategies for fracture preven-\ntion in the elderly, particularly for those populations in\nwhich vitamin D insufficiency is rife. Ca supplementation\nalone does not appear to be effective in reducing frac-\nture(93). In recent years, evidence has emerged for a role\nfor vitamin K in bone health. Further data are urgently\nrequired to enable a fuller understanding of the complex\ninteraction between dietary factors and bone health.\nAcknowledgement\nThe author has the following conflicts of interest to\ndeclare: S.L-N. is co-director of D3TEX Ltd, a company\nwhich has a patent pending on materials which allow sun-\nlight through.
