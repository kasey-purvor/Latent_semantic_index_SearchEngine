At a recent workshop in South \nAfrica, UK and South African scientists and engineers discussed the current \nunderstanding of this hazard, as it affects major power systems in Europe and \nAfrica. They also summarised, to better inform the public and industry, what can be \nsaid with some certainty about the hazard and what research is yet required to \ndevelop useful tools for geomagnetic hazard mitigation. \n \n \nBackground \n \nGeomagnetically induced currents (GICs) are a natural hazard that can affect \nconducting infrastructures, such as power grids and pipelines (e.g. Boteler et al, \n1998; Kappenman, 1996, 2004; Pirjola, 2002). GICs are a direct result of solar \nactivity, which gives rise to space weather and consequently to geomagnetic \nstorms. Besides power grids and pipelines, space weather can disrupt \ncommunications, use of the global positioning system (GPS), and pose risks to \nsatellite and spacecraft operations. (Recent summaries on the space weather \nhazard can be found in, for example, Lanzerotti et al, 1999; Pirjola et al, 2005; \nThomson, 2007; Eastwood, 2008) \n \nThe origin of GICs and space weather lies in the Sun\u2019s magnetic activity cycle. The \nmost significant solar phenomenon for space weather is a \u2018coronal mass ejection\u2019 \n(CME). Heading Earthward in one to three days, CMEs evolve as they interact with \nthe ambient solar wind flow. When CMEs impact the Earth\u2019s protective \nmagnetosphere, their energy and electrical plasma boost existing magnetospheric \ncurrents. These current systems cause large magnetic variations that induce \nelectric fields in the solid Earth. These fields, in turn, generate the GICs that flow in \n 2\nconducting pipes and wires, in ways influenced by the electrical properties of each \nnetwork. \n \nThere is much documented and anecdotal evidence of the effects of GICs on the \npower systems of the developed world (e.g. Bolduc, 2002; Molinksi, 2002; \nPulkkinen et al, 2005; Kappenman, 2005; Trichtchenko et al, 2007). The most \nwidely known example of a damaging impact is the collapse of the Hydro Quebec \npower system on 13th March 1989. A severe geomagnetic storm shut down the \ncomplete high voltage system of Quebec, estimated at within 1 minute and 10 \nseconds, with a consequent economic cost and social disruption (Bolduc, 2002). \nMore recent storms, for example the October 2003 \u2018Halloween\u2019 magnetic storm \n(which resulted in lower latitude auroral activity, as in Figure 1), are also known to \nhave affected networks in Europe, North America, South Africa and elsewhere (e.g. \nPulkkinen et al, 2005; Gaunt and Coetzee, 2007; Thomson et al, 2005). An \nestimate of the present-day economic cost of a repeat of the most severe \ngeomagnetic storm known (the \u2018Carrington Storm\u2019 of September 1859) has also \nrecently been made by the US National Research Council (2008). \n \nTogether with the power grid evidence there is now more than thirty years of \nscientific research into the subject (including, recently, Erinmez et al, 2002; \nKappenman, 2005; Pulkkinen et al, 2005; Wik et al, 2008). Progress has certainly \nbeen made, in terms of quantifying the Sun-Earth magnetic connection. However \nmuch remains to be done. In those thirty-plus years it has been found that \nunderstanding the geomagnetic hazard is a truly cross-disciplinary activity, \nparticularly when considering its impact on technology at ground level. There is \ntherefore much scope remaining for engagement between solar-, space- and geo-\nphysicists and the power engineering community, to turn scientific knowledge into \npractical tools for risk assessment and hazard mitigation. \n \n \nA Workshop on the GIC Hazard to Power Grids \n \nIn December 2008 the University of Cape Town and the Hermanus Magnetic \nObservatory hosted a workshop in South Africa for a group of UK and South \nAfrican scientists. This workshop was funded by the Royal Society, on behalf of the \nUK government, and by the National Research Foundation, on behalf of the \ngovernment of South Africa. Using their expertise in space physics, geophysics and \nelectrical power engineering, the workshop participants spent a week discussing \nissues within the GIC risk to high voltage power grids, in both developed and \ndeveloping countries around the world. Examples of European and African national \npower grids were examined. \n \nOne aim of the GIC workshop was the free exchange of ideas, insights and \nknowledge on the natural geomagnetic hazard and on GIC risk. This was for mutual \neducation and to help promote future research between the two countries in the \ncross-disciplinary manner suggested above. A second aim of the workshop was to \nsummarise the scientific and engineering \u2018state of play\u2019 for the power engineering \nindustry, for the public and for policy makers. The workshop participants therefore \ncompiled a short list of major points that they believed with some confidence that \n 3\nscientists and engineers do know about the GIC risk to electric power systems, as \nwell as major things we still don\u2019t know.  \n \nIn the following sections we list, in relatively simple terms, ten major \u2018do knows\u2019 and \nten major \u2018don\u2019t knows\u2019 about GIC risk, together with some short explanatory notes. \nThe ten items on each of the two lists are ordered approximately in the time-order \nof CME onset through to power system damage and not in any order of relative \nimportance. \n \n \nTen things we do know about the GIC risk to power grids \n \n1. Solar storms (i.e. CMEs) that lead to high levels of GICs are statistically more \nlikely during periods close to solar maximum and in the descending phase of the \nsolar cycle, but they do also occur at all other times in the solar activity cycle (as \nidentified in Figure 2). \n \nThe number of major CMEs varies with the cycle of solar (sunspot) activity. \nHowever large amplitude eruptions do occur even when the magnetic \nactivity cycle is at a minimum, for example in 1986. This means that the GIC \nrisk is not restricted to just a few years around the maximum in solar activity. \nIt is always present. \n \n2. The magnetospheric and ionospheric currents that drive GICs are different at \ndifferent latitudes (see, for example, the complex and dynamic system of \nionospheric currents shown in Figure 3 for northern Europe during one major \nstorm). \n \nThe Earth\u2019s near-space environment (the magnetosphere) contains a \ncomplex system of diffuse, but large scale electrical currents that connect \nwith currents that flow in the ionosphere, in the upper atmosphere. These \ncurrents are modulated and amplified by solar activity. The structure and \ndynamics of these current systems changes with latitude. Understanding the \ndetails of the behaviour of these current systems, and their effects, is an \nactive research area in space- and geo-physics, though the broad picture is \nwidely agreed. For example, at higher latitudes the \u2018auroral electrojets\u2019 \ninduce largely east-west surface electric fields. In principle, the largest \nvoltage difference across a power network should occur in this orientation. \nHowever it turns out to be incorrect to assume that the largest GICs always \noccur in transmission segments with an east-west orientation; in some cases \nan almost north-south orientation may be more important. \n \n3.  The dominant cause of GICs in power grids is the time rate of change of the \nEarth\u2019s magnetic field. \n \nThere are firm theoretical reasons for this, as well as the simple observation \nof a strong linear correlation between the time-rate-of-change of the \nmagnetic field and measured GICs, at all latitudes. Accurate prediction of \nGIC risk then requires accurate prediction of changes in the magnetic field \n 4\n(see, for example, Wintoft, 2005). This is still scientifically hard to do. (We \nshould note also that recent work has suggested significant correlations \nbetween GIC and the field itself: Watari et al, 2009.) \n \n4. Interpolating the magnetic field from spatially distributed geomagnetic \nobservations improves the prediction accuracy of GICs at any given point, even at \nmid-latitudes (e.g. Bernhardi et al, 2008). This is in comparison with predictions \nmade from data from a single magnetic observatory, taken to be representative of \nthe \u2018regional\u2019 situation.  \n \nThis follows from point two. The natural magnetic field at any point in a \npower grid, where we need to predict GICs, is mostly affected by those \nmagnetospheric and ionospheric currents systems that are closest to it. \nNeighbouring permanent geomagnetic observatories are the best means to \ninterpolate geomagnetic activity to a given measurement site. Simplified \nassumptions \u2013 such as the so-called \u2018plane-wave model\u2019, which is based on \nsingle-site data \u2013 give an incomplete picture of magnetic changes across \nregional scale power grids. In addition, measured GIC at any point may be \nthe sum of induction processes in several connected transmission lines. \n \n5.  GICs are larger in countries and regions where the geology is generally more \nresistive (discussed e.g. in Pirjola and Viljanen, 1991). \n \nWhile the magnitude of the magnetic field change is the most significant \nvariable affecting the magnitude of the GICs, higher resistance rock \nincreases the natural surface electric field that acts as the voltage source (or \n\u2018battery\u2019) for GICs, operating in the line between the neighbouring grounding \npoints in any given grid (see e.g. Boteler and Pirjola, 1998). Conductivity is a \nfunction not just of rock type, but also of fluid and mineral content, and \nneeds to be considered separately for each power network region.  \n \n6. A multi-layered and laterally varying ground conductivity model gives better \nprediction of GICs, than the simpler assumption of an homogeneous Earth (e.g. \nNgwira et al, 2008; Thomson et al, 2005). \n \nCloser correlation between measured data and scientific models of GICs is \nobtained by using a three-dimensional conductivity model of the Earth.  \n \n7. GICs have been demonstrated to affect power systems at all latitudes (see, for \nexample, damage to a South African transformer shown in Figure 4). \n \nThere is a perception, particularly common within government and industry, \nthat GICs are a risk only for power grids at relatively high latitudes. For \nexample GICs in the past have been widely reported and analysed in \nCanada, Finland and Scandinavia. GICs have however also been measured \nand reported in more mid-latitude counties such as the UK and USA. The \nworkshop participants however also learned of GIC effects and studies in \nSouth Africa and Brazil, both countries at low geographic and geomagnetic \nlatitudes, and learned of anecdotal evidence for GIC impacts elsewhere in \nthe world, at all latitudes. Recent research papers from Japan (data from \n 5\naround 44 degrees north: Watari et al, 2009) and China (around 23 degrees \nnorth: Liu et al, 2009) are testament to this. This means that assessing the \nrisk from space weather to our technological infrastructure is a concern for \nall countries.  \n \n8. GICs can affect many power transformers simultaneously at multiple points \nacross regional and continental scale networks (e.g. GIC data in Figure 3). \n \nThis distinguishes global and continental scale space weather impacts from \nlocalised terrestrial weather impacts such as lightning, ice and severe wind \nstorms. GICs require a different approach to the analysis of power system \nfailure, in comparison with standard approaches that usually assume \nindependence of events initiating system faults (\u2018contingencies\u2019). \n \n9.  Series capacitors in transmission lines may interrupt GIC flow in power \nnetworks, but are expensive. However some strategies involving capacitors may \nincrease GIC and reactive power demands (e.g. Erinmez et al, 2002). \n \nEngineering and mitigation strategies are known to exist that are intended to \nprotect against GIC damage. However this \u2018do know\u2019 tells us that any \nnetwork as a whole must be protected. Attempting to protect single or just a \nfew assets will merely redistribute GICs and may put other assets at risk. \nLower-cost mitigation techniques can be implemented instead of series \ncapacitors in the transmission lines, but these have other effects on power \nsystem operation. The capacity to mitigate the impact of GICs might not be \nwithin the scope or control of independent and individual owners of \ntransmission networks and power stations. Careful network planning, \nnumerical modelling and testing is suggested in each case. \n \n10. It is possible from transformer dissolved gas analysis to identify GIC-initiated \ndamage before complete transformer failure occurs (see, for example, Figure 5). \nThis is especially true if the rate of gassing simultaneously increases in widely \nseparated transformers across a network. \n \nExcessive heating in a transformer leads to the breakdown of the insulation, \nreleasing gas that can be detected. Tracking the changing level of evolved \ngas can indicate the risk of future cumulative damage to each transformer, \nfor example while measured GICs remain below warning thresholds. \n \n \n \nTen things we don\u2019t know about the GIC risk to power grids \n \n \n1. What are the solar and interplanetary events and signatures (peaks, duration, \nlocation) that are most \u2018geo-effective\u2019, in terms of GIC causation. For example what \nsignificance, if any, can be attached to reported peak solar flare magnitudes, e.g. \nas listed in Table 1, in understanding historical GIC? \n \n 6\nScientists have relatively detailed data on solar and interplanetary events \ngoing back just 40 years or so. We therefore do not yet know the extremes \nto which the Sun can operate or know with certainty which particular \n\u2018markers\u2019 of solar activity are most relevant. Progress on models of solar and \nsolar wind variability is also required. \n \n2. What are the characteristics of extreme geomagnetic storms that pose the \nhighest risk to power systems (see, for example, the relation of major storms to the \nsunspot cycle shown in Figure 6)? \n \nThis is related to point one. Scientists also have relatively detailed and \ncontinuous data on geomagnetic events going back to around the 1840s. In \nmany respects the \u2018Carrington Storm\u2019 (1st September 1859) was a far more \nsevere storm than any that has been measured since (see, e.g., US National \nResearch Council, 2008). The possibility of another event of a similar \nmagnitude to this therefore needs to be carefully considered. All available \ndata needs to be fully scanned, digitized and exploited. In particular we note \nthat existing published hourly, daily and annual mean geomagnetic data are \nnot sufficient to fully analyse GIC hazard: the periods of most interest are \naround a few seconds to a few tens of minutes. \n \n3. In predicting GICs, what is the relative contribution of each of the different \ncomponents of the geomagnetic field (i.e. the horizontal and vertical components \nand of the total field magnitude), as well as the relevance of other data, such as the \nionospheric total electron content (TEC) and the interplanetary magnetic field \nmagnitude and direction (e.g. Pulkkinen et al, 2006)? \n \nWe know that each of these factors is either directly relevant or is a useful \nproxy for other relevant data, but more study is required. What is the \nminimum information we need in order to maximise GIC prediction \naccuracy? Can we, for example, derive useful near real time information on \nchanging ionospheric current systems from GPS TEC measurements that \nvary with time? \n \n4. What are the definitive spatial and temporal scales of the magnetospheric and \nionospheric currents that drive significant GICs in grids? \n \nGICs respond to magnetic variations on many timescales. At this time it is \nbelieved that the dominant periods of interest are probably a few seconds to \ntens of minutes. How detailed do our ionospheric and magnetospheric \ncurrent models therefore need to be, in time and space, to capture the \nphysics of the problem? \n \n5. What is an adequate number and distribution of magnetometers for GIC \nmodeling in the UK and South Africa (and similarly for other countries)? \n \nThis is related to point four. Can we define guidelines that help developed \nand developing countries, wherever they are, to set up networks of \nmagnetometers; or do we need to approach the problem on a case by case \nbasis, with regard to latitude, geology, geophysics and space physics? \n 7\n \n6. Which information, given on what timescale, is most useful for any given power \nutility\/ authority to manage its GIC risk?  \n \nCMEs take between just under one day and perhaps up to 3-4 days to reach \nthe Earth. The solar physics underpinning CME formation and release is not \nwell understood and predictive models of CMEs are limited in their \ncapabilities. So much is still required scientifically. However the question can \nstill be posed of industry: what would be ideal and what would be desirable \nin terms of warning time and information content? Also, what are the costs \nand other consequences of incorrect high-activity forecasts? \n \n7. In modeling GICs in a power grid, what is an appropriate level of detail required \nof Earth conductivity (as a three dimensional model or otherwise)? \n \nIn practical terms simple conductivity models that vary only with depth \nremain useful for inland continental regions, away from coasts. But what \nabout the coasts, where many high-value generating assets are located, due \nto proximity to cooling water and access to fuel? How accurate does industry \nneed GIC modeling to be? How quickly do models have to perform to \nprovide useful forecast data, and does this imply restricting complexity of \nmodel to meet targets? \n \n8. What are the characteristics of power transformers that determine their \nsusceptibility to GICs and therefore determine the extent of damage sustained \nunder different levels of GICs? \n \nIndustry data on transformer designs need to be examined in more detail \n(e.g. Lahtinen and Elovaara, 2002). How can transformers be tested or \ncertified for compliance with specifications that are intended to reduce \ndamage by GICs? \n \n9. What are the transformer failure mechanisms subsequent to damage initiated by \nGICs? \n \nThis is related to point eight. Major details are understood from observations \nof GIC damage, but laboratory tests on failure modes are rare. How do \ngassing and other condition monitoring records help? Are there emerging \nindustry standards for transformers, for protection against GICs and the \nsubsequent deterioration leading to failure? What other work needs to be \ndone here? \n \n10. Where should scientists go to gain access to industry archives, particularly \narchives of any GIC measurements obtained concurrently with network data (i.e. \nnetwork configuration and connections, DC resistances of transmission lines and \ntransformers and station earthing resistances)? \n \nThe absence of open source data is a continuing problem for scientists, \nalthough the commercial issues are appreciated. However some progress, \nperhaps through support from national industry regulators, industry or \n 8\nprofessional societies would be helpful. Also, there is a need for long term \nmonitoring in any given power grid, as the electrical (near-DC) \ncharacteristics of each grid changes over time. \n \n \nConclusions \n \nCompared with the \u2018do knows\u2019 in our list, our \u2018don\u2019t knows\u2019 may be more \ncontentious within the scientific community. It may be debated which items are \nmost important at the present time, understanding that other issues might yet \nbecome more relevant. However by making scientific progress on our current \u2018don\u2019t \nknows\u2019 we do believe that scientists will improve their ability to monitor, model and \npredict the impacts of space weather and GICs on power grids.  \n \nSolar cycle 24 is just beginning and we can expect that the space weather hazard \nto ground-based technologies will increase, just as it did during the up-turn of \nprevious cycles. The main message of the Hermanus workshop is therefore that we \nneed a wider discussion on all of the issues, not just within the GIC science \ncommunity, but also within industry and wider society. We hope that our lists will go \nsome way to start that discussion and promote much needed future research. \n \nA future scientific workshop is planned for 2010\/2011, again in South Africa. This \nmeeting is planned to be more broadly based than the recent one was, involving \ninvitations to specialists from outside the UK and South Africa. At this meeting we \nwill discuss what progress has been made against our list of \u2018don\u2019t knows\u2019 and, in \ngeneral, discuss progress on GIC risk assessment and on the geomagnetic hazard. \nWe would also like to be able to consider the wider impacts of GIC, for example \nwithin pipeline and railway networks.  \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThe workshop was supported financially by a \u2018UK-South Africa Science Network \nPhase II\u2019 grant.
