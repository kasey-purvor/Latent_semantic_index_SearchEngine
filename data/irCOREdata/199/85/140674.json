There is increasing interest in estimating \nand comparing burdens of disease generally [1] and for cancer [2]. Estimates can \nidentify major risk factors and high risk populations, support decisions on priority actions \nfor risk reduction and provide an understanding of important contributions to health \ninequalities. The overall aim of this project is to estimate the current burden of cancer in \nGreat Britain attributable to occupational factors and identify carcinogenic agents, \nindustries and occupations for targeting risk prevention. This paper presents the results \nfor benzene associated with leukaemia and discusses these in the context of results for \nother leukaemogens and other carcinogens and cancers sites. \n2 Material and methods\nThe methods have been described in detail elsewhere [3]. Briefly, attributable fractions \n(AF) (i.e. the proportion of cases that would not have occurred in the absence of \nexposure) and attributable numbers (AN) are estimated for cancer mortality and \nincidence for all cancers, agents and occupations classified by the International Agency \nfor Research on Cancer (IARC) as group 1 (definite) and 2A (probable) occupationally-\nrelated human carcinogens [4]. Benzene is classified as a group 1 carcinogen.\nEstimation was carried out using 2005 data for mortality and 2004 for cancer incidence. \nThere are several methods for estimating the AF but all depend on knowledge of the risk \nof the disease due to the exposure of interest and the proportion of the target population \nexposed [5]. A latency of 0-20 years was assumed for leukemia and we defined the risk \nexposure period (REP) for deaths occurring in 2005 as 1986-2005. \nThe Carcinogen Exposure database (CAREX) was used as the basis for estimating \nproportions exposed over the REP in different industry sectors, taking account of \nchanging employment levels and employment turnover [6]. A review of exposure to \nPage 3 of 8\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n3\nbenzene in different industries and occupations in the US and Europe showed that \nbenzene levels have been greatly reduced over time in occupations such as the \npetrochemical industry, service station attendants, the coke oven industry, motor \nmechanics, aviation workers and urban workers [7].  A typical arithmetic mean (AM) \nvalue for long-term exposure is around 0.3mg\/m3, approximately 0.1ppm (1ppm = \n3.25mg\/m3), although values vary between much lower for urban workers such as traffic \npolice and bus drivers (0.20mg\/m3), to much higher for workers in coke plants \n(1.79mg\/m3).  An average cumulative exposure, assuming 30 or 40 years at 0.1ppm \nlevel would be between 3 and 4ppm-years.  Intermittent and short term exposures can \nbe much higher than the average long term exposures in several industries, with several \njobs having AMs over 2mg\/m3 and some having maximum short-term exposure levels \nover 10mg\/m3 (3ppm).  These types of workers might thus have had cumulative \nexposures between 5-10ppm-years.  Historically it is thought that some workers in the \n1960s and 1970s might have been accumulating exposures much higher than this, up to \n100ppm-years.  These results were used to allocate the industry sectors in the CAREX \ndatabase to a \u2018higher\u2019 or \u2018lower\u2019 level of exposure. \nRisk estimates for acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) were selected from the \npublished literature and assigned to industry sectors to reflect the broad levels of \nexposure as described above: (i) RR=1.32 (95%CI 0.49-2.88) for land transport [8] (ii) \nRR=2.17 (95%CI 0.9-5.2) for workers in industrial chemical manufacturing [9] (iii) \nRR=1.11 (95%CI 0.3-2.83) for industry groups with low levels of benzene exposure [10]. \nMonte Carlo methods were used to obtain random error confidence intervals (CI) for the \nAFs and attributable numbers were estimated for adults aged 15-84 in GB by applying \nthe AFs to total cancer specific deaths for 2005 and cancer registrations for 2004.\n3 Results\nPage 4 of 8\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n4\nA total of 3102 people (2001 male, 1101 female) died in 2005 aged 15-84 years from all \nleukaemias in GB, including 1681 ANLLs (1017 male, 664 women); in 2004 there were \n5402 cancer registrations for all leukaemias (3333 male, 1869 female) including 2820 \nANLLs (1807 male, 1013 female). The AF for ANLL attributable to occupational \nexposure to benzene was 0.25% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0, 4.65) overall and \n0.19% (95% CI 0, 3.28) for males and 0.34% (95% CI 0, 6.76) for females. The \nattributable fractions are higher for females than males due to the larger numbers \nexposed at low risk to benzene in industry sectors such as personal and household \nservices which includes repair services, domestic services, dry cleaning, photography \netc. There were 2 deaths and 3 registrations for both males and females. These \noccurred in the following industry sectors: wholesale and retail trade, restaurants and \nhotels which included bulk petrol sales and gasoline retail sites (1 death, 1 registration), \nland transport (0 deaths, 1 registration), personal and household services (3 deaths, 5 \nregistrations). \nIARC has evaluated 9 carcinogenic agents or occupations in relation to leukaemia. \nThree of these, boot and shoe manufacture, petroleum refining and the rubber industry, \nhave been included in the estimate for benzene. The attributable fractions, numbers of \ndeaths and registrations for the burden of leukaemia due to the other 5 are presented in \nTable 1 together with the results for benzene and all leukaemias. The numbers of deaths \nand registrations for ionizing radiation are based on a subset of leukaemias excluding \nchronic lymphatic leukaemia, those for benzene are based on ANLL and those for the \nother agents on all leukaemias.  In Table 1 the AFs for benzene and ionizing radiation \nare related to all leukaemias for comparison purposes. The highest AFs and numbers of \ndeaths and registrations are found for non-arsenical insecticides followed by \nformaldehyde and benzene. The higher estimates for both non-arsenical insecticides \nPage 5 of 8\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n5\nand formaldehyde compared to benzene occur not because of high risks associated with \nthese substances but because there are large numbers exposed over the risk exposure \nperiod at low levels, for example for formaldehyde in the manufacture of textiles, wood \nproducts and furniture. For comparison, the results for our estimate of the overall burden \nof cancer due to occupational carcinogenic agents or occupations classified by IARC as \ngroup 1 or 2A are shown in Table 1. Using total cancer registrations benzene ranks 34 \nout of 41 carcinogens or occupations for which estimation was carried out.\nTable 1 Attributable fractions and numbers of deaths and registrations for agents defined \nby IARC as 1 or 2A for leukaemia \nAgent AF%\nAttributable \nDeaths\nAttributable \nRegistrations\n1,3-Butadiene 0.008 0 0\nBenzene 0.14* 4 7\nEthylene Oxide 0.01 0 1\nFormaldehyde 0.23 7 12\nIonising radiation 0.01* 0 1\nNon-arsenical \ninsecticides 0.38 12 19\nAll Leukaemia 0.77 24 40\nOverall Burden*** 5.3** 8021 13693\n*AF as % of all leukaemia\n**AF based on deaths\n***Estimate for all occupational carcinogens classified by IARC as group 1 or 2A\nDiscussion\nPage 6 of 8\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n6\nWe have developed a study methodology that can be readily adapted and extended to \ninclude social and economic impact evaluation. For example, both the methods and \nresults from the study are currently being utilised to inform an EU project evaluating the \nimpact of setting occupational exposure limits for several carcinogens and will be \nadapted to update the Global Burden of Cancer due to Occupation.\nOur results for leukemia are smaller than those of several other estimation studies. For \nexample Doll and Peto estimated an AF of 10% for males and 5% for females for the US\n[11], Nurminen estimated an AF of 18% for males and 2% for females for Finland [12], \nand the Global Burden of Disease estimate was 3% for both males and females [13]. \nAssumptions made in the methodology and uncertainties and inaccuracies in the data \nused may have introduced biases into the estimates, the impact of which is not fully \ncaptured in the confidence intervals presented. Potential sources of bias include \ninappropriate choice of risk estimates, imprecision in the risk estimates and estimates of \nproportions exposed, inaccurate risk exposure period and latency assumptions and a \nlack of separate risk estimates for women and\/or cancer incidence. Future work will \nexplore the sensitivity of the estimates to such sources of uncertainty and bias.\nVarious measures of burden are useful for prioritisation of risk reduction strategies. In \nour study benzene was placed 34th in a ranking of carcinogens and occupations based \non cancer registrations with the top 5 being asbestos, shift work, mineral oils, solar \nradiation and silica. Our estimate of the burden due to occupational benzene is likely to \nbe similar in other Western European countries and the USA but may differ in countries \nwhere high levels of benzene are still found; the latter would require both higher risk \nestimates and proportions exposed.  Other measures of burden such as years of life lost \nPage 7 of 8\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n7\nand disability adjusted life years inform different perspectives of burden and will be \nestimated as part of our on-going study.\nIn conclusion, the burden of occupational cancer due to work-related exposure to \nbenzene is small in comparison to that of other IARC group 1 and 2A occupational \ncarcinogens. \nReferences\n1.
