Mu\u00a8ller\nAbstract\n& Neural mechanisms of object recognition seem to rely\non activity of distributed neural assemblies coordinated by\nsynchronous firing in the gamma-band range (>20 Hz). In the\npresent electroencephalogram (EEG) study, we investigated\ninduced gamma band activity during the naming of line draw-\nings of upright objects and objects rotated in the image plane.\nSuch plane-rotation paradigms elicit view-dependent process-\ning, leading to delays in recognition of disoriented objects.\nOur behavioral results showed reaction time delays for ro-\ntated, as opposed to upright, images. These delays were ac-\ncompanied by delays in the peak latency of induced gamma\nband responses (GBRs), in the absence of any effects on other\nmeasures of EEG activity. The latency of the induced GBRs\nhas thus, for the first time, been selectively modulated by\nan experimental manipulation that delayed recognition. This\nfinding indicates that induced GBRs have a genuine role\nas neural markers of late representational processes during\nobject recognition. In concordance with the view that ob-\nject recognition is achieved through dynamic learning pro-\ncesses, we propose that induced gamma band activity could\nbe one of the possible cortical markers of such dynamic ob-\nject coding. &\nINTRODUCTION\nStudies on neural mechanisms of object recognition\nsuggest that objects are represented through formations\nof distributed synchronously firing neural assemblies,\ncoding for each of the various object features (Gruber\n& Mu\u00a8ller, 2005). This integrative synchronized activity,\noccurring in the high-frequency range (30\u201380 Hz), can\nbe either evoked or induced, that is, not time- or phase-\nlocked to stimulus onset (Singer & Gray, 1995). In the\nvisual domain, it has been repeatedly demonstrated that\ninduced gamma band responses (GBRs) are a signa-\nture of cortical object representation (Gruber & Mu\u00a8ller,\n2005; Kaiser & Lutzenberger, 2005; Lachaux et al., 2005;\nTallon-Baudry, Bertrand, Henaff, Isnard, & Fischer, 2005;\nGruber, Malinowski, & Mu\u00a8ller, 2004; Kaiser, Buhler, &\nLutzenberger, 2004; Tallon-Baudry & Bertrand, 1999).\nThese studies generally find increases in induced gamma\npower and\/or amplitude during the successful recogni-\ntion of complex meaningful objects, both in unambigu-\nous (Gruber & Mu\u00a8ller, 2005; Gruber et al., 2004) and\nambiguous displays (Lachaux et al., 2005; Tallon-Baudry\net al., 2005).\nHowever, although the amplitude of the induced\nGBRs has been enhanced by successful object recogni-\ntion, their latency has remained fairly steady across\ndifferent conditions. In other studies, the amplitude of\ninduced GBRs was modulated by additional demands on\nworking memory processing as latency remained con-\nstant (Posada, Hugues, Franck, Vianin, & Kilner, 2003;\nTallon-Baudry, Bertrand, Peronnet, & Pernier, 1998).\nEven with intracerebral recordings, different latencies\nof induced GBRs have so far only been obtained be-\ntween different cortical regions, as synchronization\nwas propagated through visual areas, but within a single\nbrain region, they remained fairly stable across condi-\ntions (Lachaux et al., 2005).\nOne needs to remark, though, that the possibility of\nlatency modulations has not been adequately addressed\nin existing studies on induced GBRs due to the nature of\nthe paradigms that have been used to elicit the GBR.\nOne common factor in all studies on oscillatory synchro-\nny and object recognition is that they contrast success-\nful and unsuccessful recognition, using object detection\ntasks that require the stimulus to be compared to a sin-\ngle candidate template or, more rarely, to a very lim-\nited number of templates. Such designs have allowed for\nmodulations of induced gamma amplitude with a cor-\nrect match of stimulus and template eliciting higher\namplitudes of induced GBRs. In order to obtain a mod-\nulation of the latency of the induced GBR, it is reason-\nable to assume that one would have to introduce a task\nwhere object recognition itself could be systematically\ndelayed and not simply present or absent as in the\nprevious studies.\nTherefore, by using a plane-rotation object-recognition\nparadigm, the present experiment was designed to as-\nsess the induced GBRs across conditions in which objectUniversita\u00a8t Leipzig, Germany\nD 2007 Massachusetts Institute of Technology Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience 19:6, pp. 921\u2013934\nrecognition itself occurs with a delayed latency. It has\nbeen repeatedly observed that picture plane-rotated, two-\ndimensional (2-D) images of familiar objects generally\nrequire more time to be identified than upright images\n(Murray, 1995a; McMullen & Jolicoeur, 1990; Jolicoeur,\n1985). Such orientation effects are observed in speeded\nnaming tasks performed on large and diverse stimulus\nsets, therefore demanding recognition to occur at an\nentry level of identification. Objects can be identified at\na general (superordinate, e.g., animal), intermediate (ba-\nsic, e.g., bird), and specific (subordinate, e.g., sparrow)\nlevel. Another level of identification is entry level: the\nlevel of identification at which objects are named in\neveryday life. This generally occurs at the basic level ex-\ncept for certain visually distinct exemplars, for example, a\nsparrow would be identified as a bird, whereas a penguin\nwould be identified as a penguin. Object recognition\nat the superordinate level of identification has, according\nto Hamm and McMullen (1998), been shown to be\nviewpoint-invariant (Hamm & McMullen, 1998). Identifi-\ncation at entry level, on the other hand, mainly relies\non viewpoint-dependent mechanisms (Murray, 1998)\nwhen the stimulus set is large and consists of visually\nsimilar objects. This finding has confirmed the argument\nthat recognition delays in speeded naming tasks using\nplane-rotation paradigms, which generally use such di-\nverse stimulus sets, were a result of view-dependent\nrecognition mechanisms (Jolicoeur, 1990; Tarr & Pinker,\n1989).\nSuch view-dependent object recognition of plane-\nrotated images also involves some kind of image trans-\nformation mechanism, which is nonlinear and cannot\nbe reduced to a simple form of mental rotation. For\nexample, in one study, participants were shown rotating\nimages of 2-D objects; parity judgments on such objects\n(i.e., if it is facing left or right) were slowed or speeded\nbased on the direction of motion, whereas entry-level\nnaming remained unaffected (Jolicoeur, Corballis, &\nLawson, 1998). Other studies have also demonstrated\nthat a nonlinear image transformation normalizes objects\nto the upright during identification, leading to them\nbeing recognized with a delay (Lawson & Jolicoeur,\n2003; Willems & Wagemans, 2001). These studies all\ndemonstrate that the normalization process subserving\npicture identification is not mental rotation, but a dif-\nferent mechanism that still needs to be fully specified.\nA possible proposal for this mechanism is the image\ninterpolation process (Bu\u00a8lthoff & Edelman, 1992).\nAs the aim of this study is to assess whether the time\ncourse of GBRs corresponds to the timing of object\nidentification (delayed for disoriented images), it is\nalso important to discuss a model that specifically de-\nscribes the time course of object recognition. Bar (2003)\nhas proposed that representational activity during ob-\nject recognition has an initial peak that reflects the\nintegration between concurrent bottom-up and top-\ndown streams up to approximately 100 msec poststim-\nulus onset. His model also suggests that this period of\nrepresentational activity is responsible for greatly reduc-\ning the number of object candidates on the basis of a\ntop-down influence, based on the low-frequency con-\ntent of the image. This is followed by analysis of high-\nfrequency image components. Additionally, the model\nsuggests that a period of late ongoing activity (200\u2013\n300 msec poststimulus onset) occurs after a successful\nmatch has been obtained and subsequent visual memory\nfacilitation processes, such as priming, start taking place.\nBecause the plane-rotation paradigm has not been\nused before in electroencephalogram (EEG) studies, we\nwanted to examine not only evoked and induced GBRs\nbut also event-related potential (ERP) waveforms. Sev-\neral ERP components were assessed based on previous\nfindings regarding visual object recognition (Johnson\n& Olshausen, 2003; Rossion, Joyce, Cottrell, & Tarr,\n2003; Schendan & Kutas, 2003). An early component\nwas assessed: the N1 at posterior sites and its anterior\ncounterpart sometimes referred to as a P150. This is\na component that represents one of the earliest mark-\ners of visuoperceptual categorization (Rossion et al.,\n2003). Two late components were also assessed: P300\n(270\u2013380 msec), a component that can reflect possi-\nble differences in task demands between conditions\n(Donchin & Coles, 1988), which might have been mod-\nulated if rotated pictures were more difficult to recog-\nnize; and parietal negativity, appearing approximately\n400\u2013500 msec poststimulus onset, which has been sug-\ngested as a marker of \u2018\u2018mental rotation\u2019\u2019 in 3-D visual\nobject identification studies (Schendan & Kutas, 2003).\nWe wanted to find out if this parietal increase in nega-\ntivity might also be elicited by a presumed nonlinear\nimage transformation that would occur during the nor-\nmalization of 2-D objects.\nThe main purpose of the study was to compare\nevoked and induced GBRs because it has been hypoth-\nesized that they have different functional roles in cog-\nnitive processing (Herrmann, Munk, & Engel, 2004).\nEvoked responses (occurring approx. 100 msec post-\nstimulus onset, with a peak highly localized to the fre-\nquencies around 40 Hz) are considered by Herrmann\net al. (2004) to be a marker for matching the stimulus\nwith memory contents, whereas induced GBRs are sup-\nposed to reflect the further utilization of this memory-\nmatched information. Because the visual processing that\noccurs up to approximately 100 msec would allow for\nselection of representations that are sufficient for cate-\ngorization (Bar et al., 2006; Bar, 2003) but may not be\nenough to support entry-level recognition, it is expected\nthat no modulation of evoked activity will be found,\nas only induced GBRs latency modulations would be\nable to reflect the delay in later, view-dependent recog-\nnition processes.\nIn summary, the study\u2019s purpose was to assess wheth-\ner the latency of induced GBRs can be related to the\norientation of the object, and thus, to the speed of re-\n922 Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience Volume 19, Number 6\ncognition itself. A delay in the peak latency was assumed\nfor plane-rotated images, as the appropriate object rep-\nresentation could only be primed after both image nor-\nmalization and selection of the accurate match between\nthe object candidates had already been performed.\nMETHODS\nParticipants\nSixteen healthy, right-handed university students (8 wom-\nen; aged 19\u201330 years, mean age = 23 years) received class\ncredit or a small honorarium for participation. Parti-\ncipants reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision.\nThey were all native speakers of German and had not\npreviously participated in picture recognition studies.\nIndividual written informed consent was obtained and\nthe study conformed to the Code of Ethics of the World\nMedical Association.\nMaterials\nStimuli consisted of 240 line drawings of familiar objects\ntaken from existing stimulus sets (International Picture\nNaming Project with German norms, containing 525 pic-\ntures, Bates et al., 2003; 400 pictures from a French-\nlanguage naming study, Alario & Ferrand, 1999; and 152\nimages used in object recognition studies, Hamm, 1997).\nAll of the objects represented in the stimulus set had\na predominant environmental orientation, which was\nlabeled as 08 (i.e., upright). Disoriented pictures were\ncreated by rotating the upright picture by 608, 1208,\n2408, and 3008 in the frontal picture plane. Each stimulus\nwas randomly assigned to one of the three conditions,\nrepresented by 80 stimuli each: 08, \u00b1608 picture plane\nrotation (i.e., one half in 608 and the other in 3008\nrotation), and \u00b11208 picture plane rotation (i.e., one\nhalf in 1208 and the other in 2408 rotation). The 1808\nrotation was not used, as it produces reaction times\n(RTs) that are somewhat shorter than expected and very\nvariable (Lawson & Jolicoeur, 2003) due to different\npossible ways in which normalization can be achieved\n(transformation as in other conditions, or flipping-over\nin the image plane). To avoid previously reported repe-\ntition suppression effects in the induced GBRs (Gruber\net al., 2004; Gruber & Mu\u00a8ller, 2002), a different line\ndrawing was depicted in every experimental trial. Stim-\nulus presentation occurred in a random order, which\nwas different for each of the participants. Also, stimuli\nthat were assigned to the three conditions did not\ndiffer significantly in any relevant naming factors1 (see\nTable 1).\nThe final stimulus set was a result of a pilot study,\nconducted with a preliminary set, both in order to\nevaluate the suitability of the selected stimuli and to\nestablish that the standard picture-plane orientation\neffects on recognition RTs could be replicated with\nthe task. The pilot was conducted on six participants\n(4 women; aged 23\u201346 years). As in the main study,\nparticipants performed a covert naming task, requiring\nthem to press one button when the name started with a\nvowel and another when it started with a consonant\n(same as in Procedure). Mean accuracy for vowels was\n48% and mean accuracy for consonants 91%. The fol-\nlowing mean median RTs were found: upright 08: 973 \u00b1\n94 msec; rotated \u00b1608: 1009 \u00b1 95 msec; rotated \u00b11208:\n1057 \u00b1 109 msec (given RT represents only correctly\nresponded consonant trials). Thus, there was a delay of\napproximately 36 msec in recognition RTs for the 608\ncondition as opposed to the 08 condition, and a delay of\napproximately 48 msec for 1208 versus the 608 condition\n(84 msec total delay from upright to the 1208 condition).\nThe pilot demonstrated that almost all of the stimuli\nwere appropriate for the designed study. However,\nsome of the vowel stimuli had to be reclassified as con-\nsonants due to the tendency in the German language to\nshorten words to their stem form (e.g., \u2018\u2018Einkaufswagen\u2019\u2019\nbecoming \u2018\u2018Wagen\u2019\u2019). The RT differences showed a clear\norientation effect confirming the usefulness of the task\nand stimulus set in eliciting object recognition delays\nwith the plane-rotation paradigm.\nProcedure\nParticipants first performed a practice block of 10 trials\nthat were not used in the experiment itself. The ex-\nperiment consisted of four blocks, each one lasting\napproximately 4 min and containing 60 trials. Each trial\nconsisted of a variable 500\u2013700 msec baseline period,\nduring which a black fixation cross (0.38 \u0001 0.38) was\npresented. This was followed by a stimulus picture,\nwhich was displayed for 650 msec. The picture was then\nreplaced by the fixation cross, which remained on the\nscreen for a period of 1550 msec.\nTable 1.

Images of objects, sub-\ntending a visual angle of approximately 4.58 \u0001 5.28,\nwere all shown in black on a white background. Stimulus\nonset was synchronized to the vertical retrace of the\nmonitor.\nRandomized experimental lists were created using\nMatlab (The Mathworks, Inc.), whereas the presentation\nand the timing of the experiment were controlled by\nPascal on a PC 486.\nBased on the first correct name that came to their\nmind after seeing the picture, participants were in-\nstructed to press one key for objects whose name\nstarted with a vowel and another key for objects whose\nname started with a consonant. This phonological judg-\nment task was a covert naming task but also a task\ninvolving more and less frequent response-choices, as\nonly 11.25% of the stimuli had a dominant \u2018\u2018vowel\u2019\u2019\nname. These \u2018\u2018vowel\u2019\u2019 stimuli were split equally across\nthe three conditions. The importance of both speed\nand accuracy in responding was emphasized. Partici-\npants were instructed not to guess the correct an-\nswer if they were completely unaware of the identity\nof the presented objects, however, they were instructed\nto respond if they had an idea of the presented ob-\nject\u2019s identity but were not fully convinced if it was\naccurate.\nFeedback was not provided after each single trail, but\nat the end of each block. Two measures (average\naccuracy and average RTs) were computed on the basis\nof all the trials in that block and were shown to the\nparticipants. If their performance fell below the levels\nexpected based on the pilot study, they were encour-\naged to try and respond faster or more accurately.\nKey-to-task allocation was counterbalanced across\nparticipants. Halfway through the experiment, partici-\npants were asked to change the responding hand.\nParticipants were instructed to minimize eye movements\nand blinking during the display of a stimulus or the\nfixation cross.\nImmediately after the experiment, a nonspeeded\novert naming test was performed on a subset of 48\nstimuli (i.e., 20% of the total, randomly preselected from\nthe stimulus set, and all presented upright). This was\ndone only in order to verify that naming was indeed\nconducted at the entry level of identification, as pre-\nsumably, participants could still get acceptable rates of\ncorrect responses by naming at a wrong level of identi-\nfication; for instance, if they used \u2018\u2018Tier\u2019\u2019 (German for\nanimal) instead of the appropriate consonant-starting\nentry-level name such as, for example, \u2018\u2018Tiger.\u2019\u2019 Partic-\nipants were instructed to write down the name they had\nused for making their vowel\u2013consonant decision during\nthe EEG study. They were initially informed that the\nsecond part of the experiment would be an overt\nnaming task, but were not aware that it would contain\nthe same images. This was done so the participants\nwould not deliberately try to memorize the names of\nthe objects during covert naming, as this would have\nbeen an interfering additional task. The fact that mem-\nory for names was not required, and therefore, was not\noptimal, was the reason why we did not have an overt\nnaming task on all stimuli, and then use the responses\nfor proofing the correctness in the behavioral task.\nNevertheless, this limited verification provided a means\nto control that the level of identification was indeed the\none that was supposed to be elicited by the task.\nEEG Recording\nEEG was recorded continuously from 128 locations using\nactive Ag\u2013AgCl electrodes (BioSemi Active-Two amplifier\nsystem) placed in an elastic cap, referenced to an ad-\nditional active electrode (CMS\u2014Common Mode Sense;\nwith ground in additional electrode DRL\u2014Driven Right\nLeg; see www.biosemi.com\/faq\/cms&drl.htm) during re-\ncording. EEG signal was sampled at a rate of 512 Hz.\nHorizontal and vertical electrooculograms (EOGs) were\nrecorded to exclude trials with blinks and significant eye\nmovements. EEG was segmented into epochs starting\n500 msec prior and lasting 1500 msec following picture\nonset. EEG data processing was performed using the\nEEGlab toolbox (Delorme & Makeig, 2004), combined\nwith self-written procedures running under the Matlab\n(The Mathworks, Inc.) environment. Artifact correction\nwas performed by means of \u2018\u2018statistical correction of\nartefacts in dense array studies\u2019\u2019 (SCADS) (Jungho\u00a8fer,\nElbert, Tucker, & Braun, 2000). This procedure is widely\naccepted in the field and has been applied and de-\nscribed in several publications (Mu\u00a8ller & Keil, 2004;\nGruber, Mu\u00a8ller, Keil, & Elbert, 1999). Incorrectly an-\nswered consonant category trials and trials with the ob-\nject belonging to the vowel category were excluded from\nthe data analysis. The average rejection rate was 31.5%,\nresulting in approximately 47 remaining trials per condi-\ntion. Further analyses were performed using the average\nreference.\nBehavioral Data Analysis\nRTs between 400 and 2200 msec (the maximum time\nallowed for responses) after stimulus onset for trials with\ncorrect consonant responses were taken into further\nanalysis. Such parameters were chosen based on previ-\nous findings in speeded naming tasks (Murray, 1995c),\nwith the upper boundary adjusted downward in order to\ncontrol for possible outliers, keep a fast pace in the\nexperiment, and avoid long inactivity periods after a\nresponse had been given.\nMean accuracies were calculated separately for vowels\nand consonants. For correct consonant items, median\n924 Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience Volume 19, Number 6\nRTs were computed for each participant, medians being\nused in consistence with previous studies that used\nplane-rotation paradigms (Jolicoeur et al., 1998) due\nto the skewness of RT distributions. We computed\nmeans across participants to obtain a measure of central\ntendency known as a mean median RT. This procedure\nhas been previously used in studies on naming of\nrotated objects (Murray, 1995b).\nDifferences in mean median RTs for each participant\nwere calculated by subtracting the average 08 naming\ntime from RT for 608 and 1208. Thus, for each partici-\npant, two delay scores were computed: RT delay for 608\nand for 1208 conditions.\nDifferences in naming speed between the three con-\nditions were analyzed with a repeated measurement\nanalysis of variance (ANOVA) comprising the factor of\ncondition (08, 608, and 1208). Post hoc tests were per-\nformed using paired t tests.\nEvent-related Potentials Analysis\nAs depicted in Figure 1, eight regional means were de-\nfined for the purposes of EEG data analyses. Each re-\ngional mean comprised the average amplitude across the\nelectrodes at following sites: (1) anterior left; (2) anterior\ncentral; (3) anterior right; (4) central midline; (5) poste-\nrior left; (7) posterior right; (6) parietal; and (8) occipital.\nA 25-Hz low-pass filter was applied to the data before\nall ERP analyses.\nThree ERP components were assessed, N1, P300, and\nparietal negativity. In Table 2, the analysis windows and\nthe respective regional means of interest for each com-\nponent are listed. Mean amplitude within the respective\ntime window was calculated for each component and\nthe mean amplitude during the period 100 msec prior to\nstimulus onset (baseline) was subtracted. Peak latencies\nof components were not tested. Each component was\nsubject to a repeated measurement ANOVA comprising\nthe factor of condition (08, 608, and 1208). Post hoc tests\nwere performed using paired t tests.\nAnalysis of Evoked and Induced\nSpectral Changes\nInduced oscillatory activity was analyzed according to\nthe standard procedure employed in a multitude of pre-\nceding studies (e.g., Gruber & Mu\u00a8ller, 2005; Gruber et al.,\n2004).\nIn brief, spectral changes in oscillatory activity were\nanalyzed by means of Morlet wavelet analysis (Bertrand\n& Pantev, 1994), which provides a good compromise\nbetween time and frequency resolution (Tallon-Baudry\n& Bertrand, 1999). This method provides a time-varying\nmagnitude of the signal in each frequency band, leading\nto a time by frequency (TF) representation of the signal,\nand is described in-depth, together with suggested\nparameter definitions that allow for a good time and\nfrequency resolution in the gamma frequency range, in\nprevious studies (e.g., Gruber & Mu\u00a8ller, 2005). In order\nto achieve good time and frequency resolution in the\ngamma frequency range, the wavelet family was defined\nby a constant m = f0\/sf = 7, with f0 ranging from 2.5 to\n100 Hz in 0.5 Hz steps. Subsequently, these data were\nreduced to form 2.5-Hz-wide wavelets. For each epoch,\nFigure 1.

These sites of interest corresponded\nto regional means number 6 (parietal) and number 8\n(occipital), as shown on Figure 1. Peak amplitude, la-\ntency, and frequencies of local maximal amplitude at\nthese sites were analyzed during the time window of\nhighest gamma amplitude. The length of this time win-\ndow of interest was defined based on the observed\ngrand mean (GM)-induced GBR, a common approach\nin previous studies (Busch, Debener, Kranczioch, Engel,\n& Herrmann, 2004).\nIn order to identify the time window (defined above)\nand frequency range of the induced GBR peaks, mean\nbaseline-corrected spectral amplitude (baseline: 100 msec\nprior to stimulus onset), collapsed for all conditions\ntogether, was represented in TF plots in the 30\u201390 Hz\nrange. Due to interindividual differences in the induced\ngamma peak in the frequency domain, we chose a\nspecific wavelet for each subject, designed for the fre-\nquency of his or her maximal amplitude in the gamma\nrange based upon an average across all three conditions.\nSubsequently, we formed a frequency band of \u00b15 Hz\n(i.e., 10 Hz wide) centered upon this wavelet for statistical\nanalysis. In other words, within participants, the same\nfrequency band was used for all three conditions, cen-\ntered upon the individual maximal amplitude wavelet\nin an average across all conditions. Frequencies of indi-\nvidual maximal wavelets were also identified for each sep-\narate condition on TF plots of mean baseline-corrected\nspectral amplitudes. This was done only in order to verify\nthat the selected maximal wavelets (i.e., the center of the\n\u00b15 Hz frequency bands) represented all three conditions\nequally.\nThe peak latency of the GBR was defined as the la-\ntency of maximal amplitude within the \u00b15 Hz frequency\nband centered upon the individual maximal wavelet (see\nTallon-Baudry, Bertrand, Delpuech, & Pernier, 1996). The\nbasis of such a definition relies on computation methods\nthat define the time resolution of the Morlet wavelet\nanalysis. When wavelet convolutions are computed, the\nconvolution peaks at the same latency as the respective\nfrequency component in the raw data, smearing the\npeak width. This occurs because responses can be quite\njittered between trials\u2014sometimes up to 80 msec or\nmore. In other words, a gamma band peak will maintain\nits latency throughout the range of frequencies involved,\nbut its overall amplitude will end up being somewhat\nsmeared across the sample. Therefore, our peak-picking\napproach maintains the highest level of objectivity when\ncomparing latency across different conditions.\nIn order to more simply represent the gist of the ex-\nplained GBRs analysis (in particular, the peak-picking),\nan example will be given. A single participant\u2019s maximal\namplitude wavelets, determined from TF plots for sep-\narate conditions, could be 67.5 Hz for 08, 75 Hz for 608,\nand 70 Hz for 1208 condition. From the GM plot with\nall three conditions collapsed, the individual maximal\namplitude wavelet could, for example, have a frequency\nof 70 Hz. In that case, all subsequent analyses would be\nperformed within the \u00b15 Hz band centered on 70 Hz\nwavelet, that is, including the 5 wavelets between 65 and\n75 Hz (thus, 65 Hz, 67.5 Hz, 70 Hz, 72.5 Hz, and 75 Hz).\nPeak latency would be the time point of the highest\namplitude within the \u00b15 Hz band inside the time win-\ndow of interest; peak amplitude would be the mean\namplitude within the same band and time window.\nFor induced GBRs, differences between conditions in\nthe central frequencies of gamma band activity at the\nparietal regional mean (see Figure 1), the amplitude\nof the gamma peak after baseline subtraction, and the\nlatency of its maximal local amplitude were evaluated\nby means of a repeated measurement ANOVA with the\nfactor condition (08, 608, and 1208 rotation).\nAs one of the aims was to try and relate the delays\nin induced GBRs with delays in naming RTs, we also\ncomputed peak latency delays to correspond with RT\ndelays (described in Behavioral Methods). The peak\nlatency for 08 was subtracted from peak latencies for\n608 and 1208, respectively, thus obtaining measures of\ninduced GBRs latency delays. In order to see whether\nthe relations between these two measures were indirect\nor direct, we correlated induced GBRs latency delays\nand RT delays using Spearman\u2019s coefficient.\nEvoked oscillatory activity is, by definition, phase-\nlocked to stimulus onset and was analyzed through a\ntransformation of the unfiltered ERP into the frequency\ndomain. Evoked GBR is a response with low interindi-\nvidual variability in latency at frequencies between 30\nand 40 Hz, with maximal activity (sometimes described\nas a peak) usually occurring in a narrow time interval\naround 100 msec poststimulus onset. Therefore, a \u00b15 Hz\nrange was taken around a central wavelet of 35 Hz within\na time window of 50\u2013150 msec. For evoked GBRs, dif-\nferences between conditions at the site of the occip-\nital regional mean (see Figure 1), the amplitude of the\ngamma peak after baseline subtraction, and the latency\nof its maximal local amplitude were analyzed by means\nof a repeated measurement ANOVA with the factor\ncondition (08, 608, and 1208).\nTopographical distributions of GBRs were also ex-\namined in order to verify that the regional means of\ninterest (parietal for induced and occipital for evoked\nGBRs) were correctly assigned as sites with high levels\nof gamma band activity. To depict these topographies,\nwavelet analysis was recalculated for all 128 electrodes.\n926 Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience Volume 19, Number 6\nMaps of oscillatory responses in the \u00b15 Hz frequency\nband, centered upon the maximal wavelet during the\ntime window of interest, were calculated by means of\nspherical spline interpolations (Perrin, Pernier, Bertrand,\n& Echallier, 1988) for all three conditions.\nMeans and standard errors of the mean are reported\nthroughout the Results section.\nAll post hoc tests were conducted using paired t tests.\nRESULTS\nBehavioral Data\nMean correct responses were 90.4 \u00b1 1.0%. Accuracy\nrates were 56.6 \u00b1 3.5% for vowels and 94.6 \u00b1 1.1% for\nconsonants. RTs were then computed for correctly an-\nswered consonant trials. Because there were no signif-\nicant differences in RTs between 608 and 3008, and 1208\nand 2408, these data were averaged together to form two\nconditions (\u00b1608 and \u00b11208 departures from upright)\nin all further analyses. The following recognition RTs\nwere found: 08, 964 \u00b1 46 msec; 608, 977 \u00b1 46 msec;\n1208, 1015 \u00b1 52 msec.\nRepeated measures ANOVA with the factor condition\n(08, 608, and 1208) revealed a highly significant overall\neffect of rotation [F(2, 15) = 9.58, p < .001]. Post hoc\npaired t tests elucidated this effect derived mostly due\nto the fact that participants named 1208 rotated stimuli\nsignificantly slower than both upright [t(15) = \u00023.99,\np < .001] and 608 rotated stimuli [t(15) = \u00023.18, p <\n.01]. The difference in RTs between upright and 608\nrotated stimuli was not significant [t(15) = \u00021.10, ns].\nPost hoc correlational analysis across participants\n(Pearson coefficient) was carried out to more specifically\nexamine the relations between accuracy rates and RTs.\nAccuracy for vowels correlated positively with RTs (08,\nr = .56; 608, r = .53; 1208, r = .56, with p < .05) but did\nnot correlate with RT delays between conditions; accu-\nracy for consonants did not correlate with RTs (r = \u0002.23,\nr = \u0002.27, r = \u0002.29, respectively; ns). Also, accuracies\nfor vowels and for consonants were not related to each\nother (r = \u00020.19, ns). The positive correlation between\nvowels\u2019 accuracy and RT can be taken as evidence for a\nspeed\u2013accuracy tradeoff. However, no such correlations\nwere observed for the consonants\u2019 accuracy and RTs,\nshowing that no such tradeoff was present.\nEvent-related Potentials\nFigure 2 depicts the ERPs for anterior regional means,\nas well as parietal and occipital regional means (see\nFigure 2. Grand mean baseline-corrected ERPs for 08 (black line),\n608 (dotted line), and 1208 (gray line) at three regional means\n[anterior (1, 2, and 3), parietal (6), occipital (8)].\nMartinovic, Gruber, and Mu\u00a8ller 927\nFigure 1 for corresponding 10\u201320 sites) for all three\nseparate conditions.\nTable 2 provides both the properties of the ERP\ncomponents and their baseline-corrected mean ampli-\ntudes averaged across the respective time windows at\nthe site of interest, tested with repeated measures\nANOVAs to compare across the three conditions (08,\n608, and 1208).\nAs Table 2 shows, no significant amplitude modula-\ntions were found in any of the components (N1, P300,\nand parietal negativity).\nInduced and Evoked Spectral Changes\nFigure 3 shows GM baseline-corrected TF plots across\n16 participants collapsed across all three experimental\nconditions. Induced GBRs are depicted from the parietal\nregional mean (number 6 in Figure 1) and the evoked\nGBRs from the occipital regional mean (number 8 in\nFigure 1).\nGamma band amplitude evoked by picture presen-\ntations was enhanced at occipital sites (Figure 4A)\nthroughout the lower gamma-frequency ranges. Howev-\ner, it did not show a distinct 40-Hz peak, such as those\nthat have been observed in some previous studies (e.g.,\nBusch et al., 2004). Other studies, using similar line\ndrawings of objects (Gruber et al., 2004), have also failed\nto observe distinct 40 Hz peaks, which seem to be very\ndependent on stimulus saliency. However, this finding\nis not unusual, as evoked GBRs in the frequency band\nbetween 20 and 30 Hz have been previously found in\nstudies on visual information processing (Keil, Stolarova,\nHeim, Gruber, & Mu\u00a8ller, 2003). Figure 3A (bottom)\nshows the low gamma band frequency ranges with even\nmore clarity.\nEvoked GBRs were not significantly modulated across\nconditions.\nSpectral amplitude induced by picture presentations\nshowed a clear peak in a time window from approxi-\nmately 200 to 350 msec after stimulus onset in a fre-\nquency range between 30 and 80 Hz (Figure 3B).\nFor induced GBRs, individual frequencies with great-\nest amplitude fell within the frequency range of interest\nbetween 30 and 90 Hz (56.30 \u00b1 1.93 Hz). The aver-\nage frequencies of the highest amplitude wavelet were\n59.0 \u00b1 2.5 Hz for 08, 54.25 \u00b1 3.75 Hz for 608, and 55.75 \u00b1\n3.75 Hz for 1208 condition. As expected, there were no\nsignificant differences between frequencies at which the\nFigure 3. Grand mean baseline-corrected TF plots averaged across\nall three experimental conditions.

This excludes the pos-\nsibility that results were biased by systematic frequency\ndifferences. In our peak-picking approach, all three\nconditions were subsequently collapsed and the indi-\nvidual maximal wavelets (i.e., the center of the \u00b15 Hz\nfrequency bands) were selected from TF plots of a mean\nacross conditions (as described in Methods).\nGM-induced GBR, defined as the amplitude in the\n\u00b15 Hz frequency band centered on the individual\nmaximal wavelet in the time window of interest after\nbaseline subtraction, was significant when tested against\nzero, thus showing that induced gamma band peaks\nwere clearly present. This was the case both for data\ncollapsed across conditions [t(47) = 6.27, p < .01] and\nfor data when each condition was taken separately [08,\nt(15) = 3.05; 608, t(15) = 4.03; 1208, t(15) = 3.79; for all\nconditions, p < .01].\nTopographical distribution of induced gamma ampli-\ntude, computed for \u00b15 Hz frequency bands centered on\nthe individual maximal wavelet in the time window of\ninterest, collapsed across all three conditions, is shown\nin Figure 4B.\nInduced GBRs had a relatively broad scalp distribu-\ntion, with a pronounced posterior activity, centered\nupon parietal sites (especially Pz), which conforms to\nprevious findings (Gruber & Mu\u00a8ller, 2002).\nTable 3 presents results for GBRs\u2019 peak amplitude and\npeak latency.\nAs expected, statistical comparisons of induced gam-\nma band amplitude showed no significant differences\nbetween conditions.\nWith respect to peak latency, the repeated measures\nANOVA revealed a significant main effect of condition\n[F(2, 15) = 4.60, p < .05]. As enumerated in Table 3 and\nalso in Figure 5 (means and latency distributions) and\nFigure 6 (time courses), peak latency was delayed as a\nfunction of orientation. Post hoc paired t tests indicated\nthat this effect mainly arose from a significant latency\ndelay for 1208, as opposed to the 08 condition [t(15) =\n\u00022.84, p < .05]. The differences between 08 and 608\nconditions exhibited a trend [t(15) = \u00021.76, p = .10].\nDifferences between 608 and 1208 were not significant\n[t(15) = \u00021.32, p = .21].\nFigure 6A shows the time course of the GM-induced\nGBRs in the 30\u201380 Hz range, whereas Figure 6B\nand C shows time courses of activity within the indi-\nvidual maximal wavelets for two representative partic-\nipants. Although averaging of data has somewhat\nmasked the observed latency delays, the time courses\nfor representative participants demonstrate clear delay\neffects.\nObserved latency delays in the induced GBR peak\ndid not correlate with RT delays when correlations\nFigure 4.

This was supported as the\npeak latency of the induced GBR at parietal sites was\nsignificantly delayed for \u00b11208 rotated objects when\ncompared to upright objects, whereas a trend for delay\nwas observed for \u00b1608 rotated objects. This modulation\nwas present selectively for induced GBR peak latency\noccurring in the absence of any effect on ERPs or\ninduced gamma amplitude and in the absence of any\nmodulations of evoked gamma band activity.\nIn the ERPs, no overall effects of rotation on the am-\nplitudes of studied components (N1 anterior\/posterior\ncomplex; P300; parietal negativity) were found. Task-\nand stimuli-related factors have already been discussed\nas a reason behind the presence or absence of N1 modu-\nlations by object orientation in a multitude of previous\nstudies (for an overview, see Rossion et al., 2003). There\nwere no effects of image plane rotation on the parietal\nnegativity component either. It has already been postu-\nlated that mental rotation might be more frequently\nutilized in the normalization of objects with the lower\nangular disparity from upright, whereas nonlinear trans-\nformations might be more prominent for large angular\ndisparities (Gauthier et al., 2002; Tarr & Bu\u00a8lthoff, 1998;\nHayward & Tarr, 1997). However, the absence of parietal\nnegativity effects for both 608 and 1208 could be taken as\nan indicator that the neural marker of normalization\nmight differ from that of mental rotation. This would\nalso be in line with previous findings that rotation and\nnormalization processes might rely on different neural\nsubstrates (Gauthier et al., 2002).\nFigure 5.

This\nprovides an EEG-compatible paradigm, which has signif-\nicant value for future studies on the neural bases of\nobject recognition. However, certain issues need to be\naddressed. Although the results showed that naming\ntimes were a function of picture orientation\u2019s angular\ndisparity from the upright, the size of the effect was\nsmaller than the one obtained in previous behavioral\nstudies (e.g., Murray, 1995c). This may have been caused\nby the covert nature of the task as opposed to overt\nnaming used in behavioral studies. There is another\nrelated cause for the reduced object recognition delay\nelicited by our task: Because vowels were effectively rare\nstimuli, it is possible that the discrimination was not\noptimal and that the timing of button-presses was thus\nnot fully associated with the speed of naming itself. This\nnotion is supported by low accuracy rates for vowels.\nHowever, an argument that strongly favors that ob-\nserved RT delay effects were indeed related to recogni-\ntion, and not a decision-level process, is the absence of\ncorrelations between consonants\u2019 accuracy rates and\nRTs. Meanwhile, vowels\u2019 accuracy rates correlated posi-\ntively with RTs, indicating a speed\u2013accuracy tradeoff; this\nsuggests that participants did follow the instructions,\ntrying to optimize their performance by adopting a\nstrategy that would balance out speed and accuracy.\nAlso, the post-EEG naming test validated that naming\nwas indeed carried out at the required entry level of\nidentification. Thus, despite the task performance intro-\nducing some additional noise to observed RTs, the\norientation-related RT delays can be assumed to derive\nfrom a recognition-related process. Therefore, we con-\nclude that the task proposed here is a valid method of\nstudying both entry-level recognition and effects of\nplane rotation with EEG methods.\nIn our experiment, evoked GBRs were not modulated,\nwhereas induced GBRs were delayed in latency for\nplane-rotated objects. It has already been proposed in\nthe Introduction that an early stream of joint bottom-up\nand top-down processing during object recognition,\nculminating at 100 msec and reliant on low-frequency\nimage components that form the basis of object cat-\negorization, could be neurally represented by evoked\nGBRs. Meanwhile, the later stream, lasting around 200\u2013\n300 msec after stimulus onset, is connected to memory-\nrelated continuation of representational activity (Bar,\n2003) and could be neurally represented by induced\nGBRs. One could argue that view-dependent recog-\nnition in the present task would have led to a post-\ncategorization-stage delay in recognition and would\nhave selectively influenced the later stages of represen-\ntational processing, marked by induced GBR. This would\nhappen in the absence of any effects on the evoked\nGBR, which are likely to be elicited by identification of\ncharacteristic object features (Karakas & Basar, 1998;\nEckhorn, Reitboeck, Arndt, & Dicke, 1990) that can be\nconsidered to subserve categorization and to be view-\ninvariant (Wallis & Bu\u00a8lthoff, 1999).\nThe possibility that found effects were related to re-\nsponse verification processes can be discounted as the\ninformation needed for the judgment required by the\ntask would not be available prior to phonological en-\ncoding, which is estimated to occur at around 350 msec\n(Schiller, Bles, & Jansma, 2003). Additionally, it is very\nunlikely that the induced GBR findings are due to motor\nactivations as any motor planning-related activity would\nonly occur in a time window much later than 400 msec\nafter stimulus onset (Rodriguez et al., 1999). Muscle ef-\nfects on recorded gamma band activity can also be\nexcluded because they would have created highest acti-\nvations at electrode sites closest to the neck and not\nparietally. It is impossible to decisively rule out the pos-\nsibility that gamma band activity could somehow be\nrelated to generation of reflex microsaccades that orig-\ninate from the parietal eye field and are generally small\nenough to evade detection by EOGs (as already noted\nby Lachaux et al., 2005). However, such activity, related\nto a reflex movement that preserves foveal placement\nof stimuli, would be unlikely to differ systematically\nbetween the three conditions. Thus, our findings on de-\nlays of latency and their relation to delays in recogni-\ntion speed are very likely to be related to the assumed\nlate mnemonic processing of object representations,\nas supported by previous studies (Gruber & Mu\u00a8ller,\n2005; Gruber et al., 2004) and in accordance with Bar\u2019s\n(2003) model.\nHowever, it is very important to address the fact\nthat significant correlations between recognition RT\ndelays and induced GBR delays were not found. Thus,\nour obtained effects are only indirect. Until correlations\nbetween RTs and neurophysiological measures are ob-\ntained, it cannot be claimed with certainty that the\neffects are directly related to object identification pro-\ncesses. A correlation between induced GBRs and behav-\nioral measures has not yet been obtained. Only indirect\nrelations between differences in GBRs\u2019 patterns and RTs\nin groups of slow and fast responders have been re-\nported in a study using a very different auditory task\n(Jokeit & Makeig, 1994). Any lack of correlation between\nGBRs and naming times is, however, likely because\nincreases or decreases in recorded neurophysiological\nmeasures do not directly translate into RT changes\n(Fiebach, Gruber, & Supp, 2005). This is even more so\nin studies such as ours, where the RT would reflect not\nonly the speed of recognition but also different linguis-\ntic processes that influence naming speeds after the\nsemantic access stage (Alario et al., 2004). The noise\nin the EEG and behavioral data has multiple different\nsources, and interindividual maximal frequency varia-\nbility additionally contributes to the error variance in\nstudies that look at the timing of gamma band activity.\nThus, in an extensive study with much larger number\nMartinovic, Gruber, and Mu\u00a8ller 931\nof trials (and thus, a better signal-to-noise ratio), cor-\nrelations between gamma latency and RT latency de-\nlays could be obtained. However, such an ideal study\nwould be very difficult to perform, due to the meth-\nodological issues that limit the kind of stimuli that\ncan be used (e.g., in this study, the set of 240 suitable\nstimuli was chosen between more than 1000 images\nof objects). There is an alternative explanation, how-\never, which goes beyond the pure signal-to-noise issues.\nPerformance-correlated changes in object representa-\ntion have so far been found in prefrontal cortex neu-\nrons, but not in inferior temporal neurons (Rainer\n& Miller, 2000). As induced gamma band activity mainly\nreflects transient integratory activity within distributed\noccipito-temporal networks, it might not correlate\nwith performance directly, even though the reflected\nrecognition-related processing has to be reliant on iden-\ntification. Therefore, although obtaining clear con-\nnections between neurophysiological indicators and\nbehavior is a critical future goal, it is still very important\nthat this study has found a clear, albeit indirect, relation\nbetween recognition time delays and induced gamma\nband latency delays.\nTo conclude, the present experiment has, for the\nfirst time, shown a significant task-related modulation\nof the peak latency of induced GBR, using a plane-\nrotation paradigm that introduced systematic delays in\nobject recognition time. This study has also provided\nneurophysiological evidence that delays in the recogni-\ntion of plane-rotated objects occur at relatively later\nstages (i.e., post 100 msec) of visual representation. It\nwas also indicated that normalization processes that\nfacilitate object recognition might not have the same\nneural signature in the ERPs as mental rotation. Most\nimportantly, the findings on gamma band activity fit\nwithin previously proposed models of visual object re-\ncognition (e.g., Bar, 2003), showing a neural signature in\nthe gamma band for the assumed late representational\nprocesses, without any modulation of early evoked\ngamma band activity. However, the findings on induced\ngamma band delays need to be interpreted cautiously at\nthis stage as the small size of observed effects, together\nwith differences in variance between conditions, cannot\ndiscount that the effects were caused by more general\ndifferences in the overall gamma band activity distribu-\ntion. Still, peak latency as the measure of central ten-\ndency within this distribution was clearly delayed and\ndue to the selective nature of these delay effects, it is\npossible to speculate on the nature of processes whose\nneural signature the induced GBRs represent. We sug-\ngest that they reflect the later stream of representational\nprocessing, which is connected to visual memory (Bar,\n2003; supported by previous findings on induced GBRs\nby Gruber & Mu\u00a8ller, 2005 and Gruber et al., 2004).\nFinally, in correspondence with the view that object\nrecognition is achieved through dynamic learning pro-\ncesses (Wallis & Bu\u00a8lthoff, 1999), we propose that in-\nduced gamma band activity could be one of the possible\ncortical markers of such dynamic object coding.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Renate Zahn, Katrin Gottlebe, and Sophie Trauer\nfor help with data acquisition, and S\u00f8ren Andersen and Uwe\nHassler for technical assistance.
