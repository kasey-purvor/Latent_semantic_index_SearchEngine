The mineralization is hosted in a \nnormal extensional fault, representing a zone of repeated extension and vein infilling of open \ncavities, within clastic sedimentary rocks, which have only reached the late diagenetic zone \nof low-grade metamorphism.  \nThe mineralization consists of undeformed veins, stockworks and breccias. Quartz \ndominates all the veins and commonly displays multiple growth stages and a variety of \nclassic epithermal textures, including comb, plumose and banded, indicative of low confining \npressures. The veins have a simple mineralogy comprising quartz\u2013sericite\u2013chlorite with \nminor sulfides, hematite, rare visible gold, with a high silver content (up to 41 wt %), and late \nbarite and dolomite.  \nVein quartz is associated with two fluids compositions: Type I with moderate to high \nsalinity (8.0\u201323.6 wt % NaCl equiv) and Type II with low to moderate salinity (0.0\u20137.8 wt % \nNaCl equiv). CO2 contents in both fluid types are <3.5 wt percent. The majority of fluid \ninclusion homogenization temperatures range from 126 to 257oC and geologically \nconstrained depth estimates (\u22645 km) indicate maximum fluid inclusion trapping temperatures \nbetween 175 and 245\u00b0C. \nThe geodynamic setting of Bohaun, which comprises a deformed continental margin of an \nallochthonous terrane, is typical of orogenic gold deposits. However, an orogenic association \nfor the Bohaun mineralization is discounted on the basis of fluid inclusion evidence, atypical \nvein textures, gold grain composition and undeformed veins. While vein textures locally \nresemble those found in epithermal quartz\u2013adularia mineralization, there is no obvious \nmagmatic association and alteration is restricted to the veins and immediate host rocks.  \nThe origin of the gold at Bohaun remains enigmatic. However, we favor an association with \nwidespread Carboniferous or later mineralizing fluids and a model which involves transport \nand deposition of gold from a basinal brine type fluid, in a similar fashion to red-bed Au\u2013Pd \nmineralization. Bohaun provides further evidence that low temperature brines may be capable \nof generating economic grade gold mineralization, independent of other fluids. \n3 \nINTRODUCTION \n \nOrogenic gold deposits are typified by quartz\u2013carbonate-dominant vein systems associated \nwith deformed metamorphic terranes of all ages (Groves et al., 1998) and mineralization \ndisplays strong structural controls at a variety of scales. Deposits are most commonly located \non second- or third-order structures in the vicinity of large-scale compressional or \ntranspressional structures formed at convergent margins (Groves et al., 1998; Bierlein and \nCrowe, 2000; Groves et al., 2003). Goldfarb et al. (2005) identify gold deposits associated \nwith the Caledonian Orogeny in the British Isles as an example of Palaeozoic orogenic gold \nmineralization. Indeed, Caledonian basement rocks north of the Iapetus suture in the British \nIsles contain numerous important orogenic gold prospects extending from the Mayo\u2013Curlew \nBasin of western Ireland (Croagh Patrick and the mineralization of the Sheeffry Hills in \nCounty Mayo, including Cregganbaun: Thompson et al., 1992; Aherne et al., 1992; \nWilkinson and Johnston, 1996) through the North Western Basement and Longford Down \nMassif (Curraghinalt, Cavanacaw and Clontibret: Steed and Morris, 1986; Morris et al., 1986; \nCliff and Wolfenden, 1992; McCaffrey and Johnston, 1996; Earls et al., 1996; Parnell et al., \n2000) and into Scotland (Cononish and Calliacher-Urlar Burn: Curtis et al., 1993; Ixer et al., \n1997). The mineralization at Bohaun, which is the subject of this paper, is particularly \ndistinctive and differs markedly from the occurrences listed above.  \nThe Bohaun deposit is located to the south of Lough Kilbride, in northern Connemara, \nCounty Galway, Ireland (Fig. 1). North of Bohaun, gold mineralization occurs in two main \ngeological settings. On the south side of Clew Bay auriferous quartz veins, including the \nCroagh Patrick mineralization, occur along the strike length of the Silurian quartzite belt. \nFurther south gold mineralization occurs in the Ordovician rocks of the South Mayo Trough. \nThe east\uf02dwest-trending Cregganbaun Shear Zone extends through the Ordovician sequence \nwith gold occurrences at many localities along its 33 km length (Thompson et al., 1992). \nThe Bohaun deposit was discovered in the late 1980s during a commercial regional \ngeochemical sampling programme by Ovoca Gold Exploration plc. Elevated gold values \nwere identified in association with a north-trending brecciated and silicified zone of Silurian \nrocks (Fig. 2). Limited exploration was conducted, including the drilling of three shallow \ninclined boreholes. Drilling intersected a silicified breccia zone containing limonite, chlorite, \ncalcite, pyrite, chalcopyrite and visible gold, and extending to a vertical depth of at least 45 m \n(Ovoca Gold Exploration plc, unpub. data). Subsequent reconnaissance sampling identified a \nlarge and coherent zone of gold-bearing, silicified outcrops and boulders (Alba Mineral \nResources plc, press release, 14 February 2006). \nHere we present a range of field observations, petrographic information and fluid inclusion \ndata to show that the deposit was formed at shallow depths and basinal brines played a \nsignificant role in the mineralization. \n \nREGIONAL GEOLOGICAL SETTING of BOHAUN \n \nConnemara is an allochtonous terrane within the western Irish Caledonides (Fig. 1: Draut \nand Clift, 2002), which were formed during the Caledonian Orogeny (McKerrow et al., \n2000). This metamorphic terrane is situated within an arc-continent suture zone (Clew Bay\u2013\nHighland Boundary line), resulting from closure of the Iapetus Ocean during the early \nOrdovician Grampian Orogeny (c. 475\u2013462 Ma: Draut and Clift, 2002). The Connemara \nterrane is correlated with part of the Neoproterozoic Dalradian Supergroup in Scotland, a \nlithologically-varied sequence of folded and metamorphosed late Precambrian marine clastic \nsedimentary rocks and minor basic volcanic rocks (Harris et al., 1994). Adjacent to \nConnemara, the South Mayo Trough generally recognized as a forearc basin contains a thick \n4 \nsuccession of Ordovician volcanic and sedimentary rocks (Clift and Ryan, 1994; Friedrich et \nal., 1999a). The obscured contact between the Connermara terrane and the South Mayo \nTrough is inferred to be a strike-slip terrane boundary (Friedrich et al., 1999b). The \nConnemara Dalradian and rocks of the South Mayo Trough are unconformably overlain by \nSilurian (Llandovery <443 Ma) sedimentary rocks (Friedrich et al., 1999b: Fig. 1). To the \nsouth, Silurian strata extend inland east-south-east from south of Killary Harbour to the area \naround Lough Kilbride before disappearing under the Carboniferous rocks of Lough Mask. \nThe Carboniferous of South Mayo and Connemara is subdivided into basal clastics and \noverlying carbonates (Graham et al., 1989). The Carboniferous (Dinantian) strata form the \nnorth-western margin of the economically significant \u2018Irish Midlands basin\u2019, named the \n\u2018North West Province\u2019 (Phillips and Sevastopulo, 1986; Johnston et al., 1996). Outside the \nDalradian, metamorphic grade in this part of Irish Caledonides is generally very low, ranging \nfrom late diagenetic zone to upper anchizone (Rice and Williams, 2009). \nThe closest major igneous body to Bohaun is the Oughterard Granite (U\u2013Pb age of 462.2 \n\u00b1 0.5 Ma), 7 km to the south (Friedrich et al., 1999a). Late Caledonian granites are well \ndeveloped in Connemara comprising the extensive Galway Granite and its satellite plutons, \napproximately 15 km south of Bohaun (Fig. 1). Feely et al. (2003) indicate that several \nphases of granite emplacement and plutonism extended over a period of c. 30 Ma (c. 380\u2013410 \nMa, based upon TIMS U\u2013Pb ages for the granite and Re\u2013Os dates for associated molybdenite \nmineralization). Minor intrusions including felsites, quartz porphyries and lamprophyres \nassociated with the intrusion of the Galway Granite occur in the Silurian strata extending \ninland east-south-east from south of Killary Harbour to the area around Lough Kilbride \n(Graham et al., 1989). The late Caledonian Corvock Granite (c. 387 \u00b1 12 Ma, based upon a \nRb-Sr date: O\u2019Conner, 1989) intrudes the Silurian and Ordovician rocks of South Mayo and \nhas been suggested as a possible heat source for the mobilization of mineralizing fluids \nassociated with the \u2018shear-vein\u2019 deposits to the north of Bohaun (Fig. 1: Aherne et al., 1992). \nThe whole of Ireland is affected by late-Silurian to middle-Devonian Caledonian \ndeformation (Phillips and Sevastopulo, 1986). In Connemara, this resulted in thrusting of \nOrdovician rocks over Silurian strata along the Salrock Thrust South of Killary harbour \n(Morris et al., 1995). East of the Maam Valley Fault the Silurian rocks are folded into a series \nof east-striking folds. East to east-south-east faulting developed in conjunction with the \nfolding and was closely associated with prominent east-north-east faulting. In Connemara and \nSouth Mayo, the post-Dinantian structural trend is dominated by north-east-trending faults. \nMany of these structures represent reactivation of older basement structures. Some of the \nfaults transecting the pre-Carboniferous basement show post-Dinantian reactivation. \nHowever, it is difficult to differentiate this from earlier fault movement (Graham et al., 1989). \n \nMATERIALS and METHODS \n \nField mapping and sampling \n \nMapping of the Bohaun mineralization and host rocks was undertaken at a scale of 1:2500 \n(Fig. 2). Representative samples were collected from surface exposures throughout the strike \nlength of the silicified breccia zone for mineralogical, mineral chemistry and fluid inclusion \nstudies (Figs. 2, 3). The majority of auriferous samples and all the fluid inclusion samples \nanalysed were obtained from a small (10 x 10 m) well-exposed, intensely veined area (Fig. 2, \n3). This area had been the focus of previous sampling campaigns, with the majority of visible \ngold samples being derived from this locality and with sporadic high gold values, up to 73 \nppm in a one-meter channel sample (McFarlane, 2006). Furthermore, the exposure contained \nthe full spectrum of quartz types present at Bohaun and provided excellent control on the vein \n5 \nrelationships. This area was mapped in detail, at a scale of 1:25 (Fig. 3). A number of \nadditional samples were collected from the limited outcrops along the strike length of the \nmineralized zone. However, these failed to yield material suitable for microthermometric \nanalysis.  \n \nPetrography  \n \nSeventeen standard polished thin sections, representative of quartz veins and breccia \n(L26.1, L26.2, L26.4, L26.8, S0007, S0017, S0020, S0023A, L3), visible gold-bearing \nsamples (VG05, VG06, VG12A, VG12B) and host rocks (L19, L39, L53, L69) were \nexamined optically in transmitted and reflected light (samples located on Figs. 2, 3). \nCathodoluminescence (CL) observations were made using an Oxford Instruments \u201cminiCL\u201d \ncathodoluminescence detector on samples VG06 and VG12B.  \n \nElectron microprobe \n \nMicrochemical mapping and quantitative point analyses were carried out on sample VG05 \nusing a Cameca SX50 wavelength dispersive electron microprobe (EPMA). Selected areas \nwere mapped for Au, Ag, Cu and Hg by WDS analysis at 15 kV and 150 nA with count times \nof 90 milliseconds. Subsequently, point analyses were performed for Ag, Cu, S, Pd and Fe at \noperating conditions of 15 kV and 20 nA and then reanalysed at 30 kV and 20 nA so that Hg \ncontents could also be determined.  \n \nFluid inclusion microthermometry  \n \nSix fluid inclusion wafers (VG05, VG12A, comb2, S0008, S0010, S0011) were analysed \nmicrothermometrically, yielding over 200 determinations of salinity and homogenization \ntemperature. Data were collected using a Linkam THM600 fluid inclusion heating-freezing \nstage, attached to a Leitz Ortholux II petrographic microscope, controlled by a TP91 \nprogrammer. Instrument calibration was done using synthetic fluid inclusion standards. \nEstimated analytical error is \u00b10.2\u00b0C for low (<50\u00b0C) and \u00b12\u00b0C for higher (>75\u00b0C) \ntemperatures. The data are presented as last ice-melting temperatures, wt percent NaCl \nequivalent estimates, homogenization. Only equilibrium phase changes are reported. Salinity \nestimates and salt compositions were derived using the phase relations for experimentally \ndetermined salt\u2013water\u2013gas systems: NaCl\u2013H2O and NaCl\u2013H2O\u2013KCl (Sterner et al., 1988). \nInclusions were classified as primary, pseudosecondary or secondary according to the criteria \nof Roedder (1984). \n \nRESULTS \n \nGeology and structure \n \nThe Bohaun deposit is located within a tract of Silurian rocks extending east of the Maam \nValley Fault to the area around Lough Kilbride (Fig. 1). The Silurian succession at Bohaun \nranges from Llandovery to Wenlock age, resting with marked unconformity on the Dalradian \n(Fig. 2). The oldest of the Silurian rocks, the Lough Mask Formation comprises a coarse-\ngrained, commonly cross-bedded, purple sandstone. This is conformably overlain by blue to \ngrey fossiliferous sandstones and mudrocks of the Kilbride Formation. Graded sandstones \n6 \ndefine the base of the Lettergesh Formation, the uppermost Silurian unit at Bohaun, which \noccurs only to the west of the mineralized fault zone. \nThe Silurian succession has been deformed into an east-striking, gently westerly plunging \nsyncline, during regional deformation and subsequently faulted. The principal fault \ninfluencing the stratigraphy and controlling the mineralization is a steeply dipping, north-\ntrending (015\u00ba), extensional normal fault which downthrows to the west, at between 56 and \n77o. This fault offsets the late Silurian syncline developed at Bohaun. A number of additional \nbrittle normal faults splay off the main structure. A north-north-east-trending fault causes the \nmineralized zone to bifurcate at its northern end. At the southern end of the mineralized zone \ntwo mineralized faults splay off the main structure. An additional high-angle mineralized \nfault occurs to the east of the main structure. Post-mineralization displacement is evident \nfrom an obvious fault plane displaying slickensides along the western margin of the silicified \nbreccia body. This suggests that following silicification of the auriferous fault zone, \ndisplacement along the cemented fault zone gave way to displacement between the western \nside of the mineralized breccia body and the host rocks (Fig. 2). The structures and fault \ntextures observed at Bohaun are evidence for brittle failure, within an extensional tectonic \nregime. Although the stratigraphy is folded and faulted, total strain appears relatively low, as \nevident from undeformed sedimentary features and textures (e.g. bedding structures and \nlaminations, conglomerate clasts and fossils). \n \nMineralization style and alteration \n \nThe mineralization is represented by a north-trending brecciated and silicified fault zone, \nwhich is discontinuously exposed over a distance of approximately 1200 m; a significant \nbreak in exposure of more than 200 m occurs towards the northern end (Figs. 2, 4A). Over its \nstrike length the total width of the mineralized zone varies from 0.5 to 50 m. The central part \nconsists of a series of north-trending, anastomozing quartz-rich bodies measuring 1 to 2 m in \nwidth, punctuated by rafts of less silicified country rock (Fig. 3). These heavily silicified \nzones consist of a combination of discrete, undeformed veins, typically ranging in width from \n1 mm to 20 cm, pods of massive quartz and quartz cemented jigsaw breccias (Fig. 4B\u2013C). \nThis 15 m wide central zone grades laterally into a quartz stockwork, which diminishes in \nintensity with distance from the main structure. Veins within this zone pinch and swell and \nvary in width from millimeter size to about 10 cm (Fig. 4D\u2013E). A considerably narrower \nzone of quartz veining with a similar orientation to the main body is located approximately \n400 m east of the main mineralized fault zone (Fig. 2).  \nQuartz dominates all the veins and commonly displays multiple growth stages and a \nvariety of textures, including saccharoidal, plumose and comb, disposed as crustiform bands \nand forming breccia cements, as indicated by field observations (Fig. 5A\u2013H) and petrography \n(Table 1). Comb quartz and saccharoidal quartz are the most common textural variants (Fig. \n5A\u2013D). Gold enrichment is preferentially associated with clay mineral- and hematite-rich \nareas of white to grey saccharoidal quartz (Fig. 5C\u2013E). Crustiform textures (individual bands \nare millimetre size and within bands crystals have a consistent growth direction, \nperpendicular to the band: Fig. 5C\u2013D), weakly developed colloform banding (Fig. 5E) and \neuhedral, locally, acicular crystals typical of open-space filling are common (Fig. 5F\u2013G). \nFresh sulfides are extremely rare in outcrop, although extensive limonitic staining and \nremnants of oxidized sulfide, probably pyrite, are common within the quartz (Fig. 5B, E, G). \nRare occurrences of late-stage, well-developed, bladed crystals of dolomite and barite are \nfound within vugs and cavities in the quartz at Bohaun (Fig. 5H). On an outcrop scale, visible \ngold shows a close association with wall-rock suggesting that fluid\/wall rock interactions \n7 \nmay have been important. The majority of gold-bearing hand specimens also contain altered \nwall rock fragments (Fig. 5B\u2013D). \nOn a macro scale, alteration is dominated by intense silicification along and adjacent to the \nfault zone as evidenced by the extensive quartz veining, silicification of the immediate wall \nrocks and wall rock fragments within the veins (Figs. 4B\u2013E, 5B\u2013D). Veins do not display \ndistinct alteration haloes. However, wall-rock fragments and host rock adjacent to the veins \nare altered to a distinct pastel green to grey color, contrasting with \u2018unmineralized\u2019 country \nrock and indicative of the development of clay minerals (Fig. 5B\u2013D). These clay mineral-rich \nzones do not typically extend more than 30 cm from the vein margins. On a microscopic \nscale, wall-rocks to the veins and rock fragments entrained within the veins display clear \nalteration compared with \u2018unmineralized\u2019 country rock. Samples of unaltered \nmetasedimentary rocks typically contain 50 to 80 percent quartz, with up to 20 percent clay \nminerals, including discrete laths of muscovite, up to 150 \u03bcm size and interstitial to quartz \ngrains of a similar size. In contrast, alteration of this lithology has resulted in replacement of \nthe original rock with considerably finer-grained (typically ~20 \u00b5m size), intergrown quartz \nand clay mineral (up to 40%) aggregates, dominated by sericite and chlorite. \n \nVein and ore petrography \n \nIndividual quartz veins show considerable variation in cathodoluminescence response \n(Fig. 6), reflecting the multiple quartz generations indicated by the banding in hand specimen \n(Fig. 5C\u2013D). The relationships between individual quartz generations are complex. However, \na clearly rhythmical depositional sequence is evident in which three quartz variants \npredominate: (i) comb or plumose quartz comprising acicular quartz crystals up to 4 mm in \nsize; (ii) saccharoidal quartz (10\u2013200 \u03bcm); and (iii) an intergrowth of fine-grained (10\u2013100 \n\u03bcm) quartz (70%) and sericite (30%: Fig. 7A; Table 1). Gold is almost always associated with \nsericite-rich quartz and\/or sericite- or chlorite-rich veinlets (Fig. 6A, B; 7A, C). These \nveinlets occur within the intergrown quartz-sericite material and saccharoidal quartz, \norientated parallel to the vein margin (Fig. 6A). Gold grains hosted within the sericite or \nchlorite veinlets are relatively large, up to 1 mm, and may enclose individual idiomorphic \nquartz crystals (Fig. 7B). Additional quartz-sericite-filled fractures are observed extending \nobliquely away from the main gold-bearing sericite veinlets (Fig. 6A). Discrete veinlets are \nnot the only gold repository; gold grains typically up to 50 \u03bcm, occur within the intergrown \nquartz and sericite (Fig. 7D). Smaller gold grains (5\u201310 \u03bcm) occur at grain boundaries and \ntriple point junctions in association with clay minerals (Fig. 7E). Specular hematite and\/or \nhematitic quartz is closely associated with the gold and areas of chlorite. The hematite either \noccurs at the edges of veinlets (Fig. Fig. 7B), in weakly defined iron-rich bands following the \nrhythmic layering, or forming halos around isolated gold grains (Fig. 7D). Fine-grained (up to \n10 \u03bcm) chalcopyrite is locally associated with the specular hematite (Fig. 7F).  \n8 \n \nGold grain geochemistry \n \nGold grains in sample VG05 display both silvery-yellow and orange-yellow color \nvariation in reflected light, indicating their variable Ag contents. Both types of gold occur \nadjacent to one another in grains of the same morphology. Follow-up EPMA on the gold \ngrains indicates no systematic pattern to the Ag-variations. However, some grains show a \nzonation from a relatively Ag-rich rim to Ag-poor core (Figs. 8A, B, D\u2013E). Point analyses \nindicate that the Ag contents vary from 16 to 21 wt percent and 39 to 41 wt percent defining a \nbimodal distribution (Fig. 8F; Table 2). Small and variable amounts of Cu (up to 0.14 wt %: \nFig. 8C) and Hg (up to 0.09 wt %) are also present.  \n \nFluid inclusion microthermometry \n \nA fluid inclusion study was undertaken to characterize the nature of the fluids that \nintroduced gold into the system and establish the relationships between fluid, quartz type and \nmineral paragenesis (Table 3). Microthermometric analysis was focused on primary and \npseudosecondary fluid inclusions and particular attention was paid to sample VG05 (Fig. 9) \nas this demonstrates a clear paragenetic relationship between quartz-type and gold. Here, \nearly gold-hosting quartz-sericite is overgrown by plumose quartz, which in turn is \nirregularly overgrown by saccharoidal quartz. Lastly coarse-grained euhedral quartz locally \ninfills open space. Several quartz types are evident and gold is clearly spatially associated \nwith intergrown quartz-sericite (Figs. 6, 7, 9). However, it is paragenetically later, as its \ndistribution is restricted to quartz grain boundaries and small vugs lined with quartz micro-\neuhedra (Fig. 7B, C, E). The intergrown quartz-sericite locally grades into plumose quartz \n(Fig. 9A, C, E)\u2014neither this, nor later euhedral quartz, host gold. This strongly suggests, in \nsample VG05, that gold mineralization is bracketed by the deposition of these two types of \nquartz. Therefore, fluid inclusions hosted in this sample are the optimum for determining \nmineralizing fluid temperatures and compositions.  \nFor all samples, at room temperature the fluid inclusion assemblage is dominated by L+V \ninclusions with liquid fills around 80 to 95 percent by volume (e.g. Fig. 10). Clathrate \nmelting was not observed in any inclusion indicating that CO2 contents are <3.5 wt percent \n(Hedenquist and Henley, 1985). Low temperature microthermometric properties (Fig. 11; \nTable 3) indicate two distinct inclusion types: the first, Type I, is typified by low first-melting \ntemperatures (Tfm), mostly below \u201330\u00b0C, suggesting the presence of divalent cations, such as \nCa2+, in addition to sodium. Moreover, in a significant number of Type I inclusions the \npresence of a salt hydrate (Table 3), which melts close to \u201322\u00b0C, confirms this. Final ice \nmelting (Tm-ice) is variable and is in the range \u201322.0 to \u20135.1oC (8\u201323.6 wt % NaCl equiv) with \na median value of \u20138.8oC (12.6 wt % NaCl equiv). Homogenization temperatures (Th) range \nfrom 126 to 257oC, with the exception of three inclusions with Th between 30 and 70\u00b0C. The \nsecond, Type II, has high Tfm, generally much higher than \u201320\u00b0C, and is commonly \ncharacterized by rapid melting at temperatures within 1 to 3\u00b0C of Tm-ice. Tm-ice varies between \n\u20135.0 and \u20130.2\u00b0C (0 to 7.8 wt % NaCl equiv), but is generally > \u20132oC (3.3 wt % NaCl equiv). \nHomogenization temperatures range from 134 to 254\u00b0C. A small number of secondary \ninclusions (n=5) in sample COMB2 exhibited high salinities (11.0\u201321.1 wt % NaCl equiv) \nand low Th (35\u2013143\u00b0C). \nThe co-variation and frequency distribution of salinity and homogenization temperature \nare illustrated in Figure 11. This shows two distinct clusters of data: (i) approximately 40 \npercent of the data have salinities below 5 wt percent NaCl equiv and (ii) about 35 percent of \nthe data have salinities between 10 and 15 wt percent NaCl equiv. Most of the remainder \n9 \n(15%) have intermediate salinities (5\u201310 wt % NaCl equiv) with rare high salinity (>20 wt % \nNaCl equiv) variants. There is no obvious relationship between fluid inclusion type and \nquartz generation. This is illustrated petrographically in Figure 10A, where fluid inclusions \nexhibit salinity variation between 0.8 and 13 wt percent NaCl equiv (Table 3). Indeed, if all \nthe analysed samples are taken into account, all quartz generations host both fluid inclusion \ntypes (Fig. 11; Table 3). However, within a single sample not all quartz types may be present \nand each quartz type within that sample may not host both inclusion types. For example, as \ndiscussed below, in VG05 saccharoidal quartz only hosts Type II inclusions. In terms of \nhomogenization temperature, there is little obvious difference between the two inclusion \ntypes, though there is a suggestion that Type II inclusions may have slightly lower (20\u201330\u00b0C) \nhomogenization temperatures (Fig. 11). \nResults of the detailed study of the gold-bearing sample VG05 are shown in Figure 12. \nThe earliest quartz-sericite (Fig. 9A, C) mostly hosts Type II inclusions with salinities \nbetween 0.5 and 3.6 wt percent NaCl equiv (n = 9) with one inclusion exhibiting Type I fluid \ninclusion characteristics with Tfm at \u201343\u00b0C and Tm-ice at \u20139.3\u00b0C (13.2 wt % NaCl equiv). The \nplumose quartz that directly overgrows quartz-sericite (Fig. 9A, E) hosts both fluid inclusion \ntypes. Here, salinity for Type I inclusions ranges from 8.0 to 16.5 wt percent NaCl equiv (n = \n37), while for Type II the range is 0.0 to 7.8 wt percent NaCl equiv (n=16). Saccharoidal \nquartz (Fig. 9A, D) only hosts Type II inclusions and salinity ranges 0.3 to 3.3 wt percent \nNaCl equiv (n = 5). In the late euhedral quartz (Fig. 9A, D) the large majority of inclusions \nare Type I with salinities between 10.7 and 13.3 wt percent NaCl equiv (n = 17). \nHomogenization temperatures for fluid inclusions in each of the various quartz types are \ngenerally similar: (i) for quartz sericite they range from 151 to 215\u00b0C, (ii) in plumose quartz \nthey are between 145 and 218\u00b0C, (iii) in saccharoidal quartz they range from 161 to 250\u00b0C, \nand (iv) in late euhedral quartz they are between 126 and 176oC.  \n \nFluid inclusion trapping temperatures \n \nUnless fluids are trapped on the liquid\u2013vapour curve (boiling), fluid inclusion \nhomogenization temperatures do not record mineralization temperatures and to estimate \nmineralization temperatures fluid inclusion homogenization temperature data need to be \ncorrected for the effect of confining pressure. Here, we do not have an applicable \ngeobarometer (e.g. iron contents in sphalerite\u2014Lusk et al., 1993). However, on the basis of a \ngradient of ~30 to 35\u00b0C\/km predicted by lattice parameter b0 data (see Padan et al., 1982, for \ndetails) from mica (Rice and Williams, 2009; Kemp and Merriman, 2009), a mean illite \ncrystallinity value of 0.48 for pelites from the Silurian metasedimentary rocks east of the \nMaam Fault (Rice and Williams, 2009), which hosts the Bohaun mineralization, constrains \nmineralization to the late diagenetic zone of low-grade metamorphism, with a maximum \nmineralization depth of ~5km according to the basin maturity chart of Merriman and Frey \n(1999). Textures and structures described above make lithostatic fluid pressure extremely \nunlikely. Thus estimated fluid pressures are probably no greater than 50 MPa. This indicates \nthat pressure corrections are around 25\u201330\u00b0C at 50 MPa. 80 percent of the fluid inclusion \nhomogenization data range between 150 and 220\u00b0C, suggesting maximum trapping \ntemperatures between and 175 and 250\u00b0C (Fig. 13), consistent with field observations. \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nThe key geological characteristics of the Bohaun mineralization which have a bearing on \nits classification can be summarized as follows (Table 6): \n10 \n(i) It is located in the Caledonian orogenic belt, proximal to a major accretionary boundary \n(Clew Bay\u2013Highland Boundary line) and a post-Caledonian carbonate basin (Fig. 1). \n(ii) It is hosted in rocks which have only reached the late diagenetic zone of low-grade \nmetamorphism. \n(iii) The brittle nature of the ore-hosting structures sited within a normal extensional fault \nrepresents a zone of repeated extension and vein infilling of open cavities. \n(iv) The mineralogy comprises quartz-sericite-chlorite with minor sulfides, hematite, rare \nvisible gold (with a high silver content, up to 41 wt %), and late barite and dolomite. \nThe association of gold with the listed hydrothermal minerals, within a single quartz \ngeneration is evidence for a primary origin for the gold. In addition, the localized high \nsilver content mitigates against a supergene origin. \n(v) The undeformed veins display multiple growth stages and brecciation, classic \nepithermal-like textures and preservation of open-space. These indicate low strain and \nconfining pressure. \n(vi) There is no association with coeval volcanic rocks or obvious high-level magmatic \nactivity. \n(vii) Vein quartz is associated with two fluid compositions: Type I with moderate to high \nsalinity (8.0\u201323.6 wt % NaCl equiv) and Type II with low to moderate salinity (0.0\u20137.8 \nwt % NaCl equiv). CO2 contents in both fluid types are <3.5 wt percent (<0.85 mol %); \n(viii) Fluid inclusion homogenization temperatures range from 150 to 220\u00b0C and geologically \nconstrained depth estimates (\u22645 km) indicate maximum fluid inclusion trapping \ntemperatures of 175 and 245\u00b0C.  \nThe geodynamic setting of Bohaun, which comprises a deformed continental margin of an \nallochthonous terrane, is typical of orogenic gold deposits (Groves, 2003: Table 6). However, \nan origin related to post-Caledonian mineralizing fluids is also possible. This is indicated by \nthe proximity of: i) a significant late Palaeozoic (Dinantian) carbonate basin (<10 km east: \nGraham et al., 1989) and; ii) fluid inclusion salinities more typical of basinal brines \nassociated with Carboniferous and later mineralization in the British Isles (e.g. Ireland: \nSamson and Russell, 1987; Banks and Russell, 1992; Banks et al., 2002; O\u2019Reilly et al., \n1997; Wilkinson, 2010; Devon: Shepherd et al., 2005; Scotland: Samson and Banks, 1988; \nCurtis et al., 1993; Baron and Parnell, 2005). These two contrasting scenarios are discussed \nbelow. \n \nOrogenic gold \n \nPhanerozoic orogenic gold deposits are typically associated with low to medium \ngreenschist facies turbiditic rocks (Bierlein and Crowe, 2000). Bohaun is hosted in rocks \nwhich have only reached the late diagenetic zone of low-grade metamorphism. Other gold \ndeposits in western Ireland (e.g. Croagh Patrick and Cregganbaun\u2014Fig. 1) resemble classical \norogenic gold mineralization. At Croagh Patrick auriferous quartz veins are associated with \nshear zones in greeschist facies quartzites. Gold deposition was associated with unmixing of a \nH2O-CO2-NaCl fluid at 240 to 320\u00b0C (Wilkinson and Johnston, 1996).  \nAlthough highly variable, veins in orogenic gold deposits typically consist of complex \npodiform quartz veins and replacement structures. Anhedral \u2018buck quartz\u2019 (milky to vitreous \nquartz, with tightly packed, interlocking crystals) is characteristic, with overprinting by \nribbons, stylolites, spider veinlets and breccias. Veins are frequently lenticular in form, \ndisplaying banded margins and more massive interiors (Dowling and Morrison, 1990). \nOrogenic gold mineralization typically develops synkinematically, in association with at least \none phase of penetrative deformation of the country rocks, resulting in a strong structural \ncontrol (Groves et al., 2003). \n11 \nParadoxically, the quartz veins at Bohaun do not resemble the orogenic mineralization \ndescribed above. The undeformed veins, stockworks and breccias, displaying comb, plumose, \nbanded quartz textures and euhedral acicular crystals, indicate precipitation in open-space \n(Dowling and Morrison, 1990), commonly regarded as typical of epithermal-style \nmineralization, rather than orogenic deposits. Vearncombe (1993) indicates that wall-parallel \n(e.g. crustiform) and radiating textures (e.g. plumose) in quartz veins are characteristic of \nopen-space filling and gold deposits formed at high crustal levels. Furthermore, Simmons et \nal. (2005) indicate that banding is a common textural characteristic of epithermal quartz-\nadularia deposits.  \nThe fluid inclusion data provide an indication of the conditions of gold mineralization at \nBohaun. These contrast strongly with orogenic gold deposits, which are typified by low \nsalinity (\u22646 wt % NaCl equiv.), carbonic fluids (5 to 50 mol percent CO2) and temperatures in \nexcess of 270\u00b0C (Bierlein and Crowe, 2000). The Bohaun data are more comparable with \nepithermal deposits (Simmons et al., 2005), in respect of maximum fluid temperatures of \napproximately 270\u00b0C and low (< 3.5 wt %) CO2 content.  \nThe oxidized nature of some of the sulfides could indicate that the gold is supergene in \norigin. However, hypogene gold when weathered typically develops thin (20\u201340 \u03bcm) silver \npoor (<1 wt %) rims (e.g. Hough et al., 2007). This contrasts with the relatively Ag-rich rim \nto Ag-poor core recorded from some grains at Bohaun (see Fig. 8 D, E). This mitigates \nagainst a supergene origin. Furthermore, the silver-rich (39\u201341 wt %) gold is consistent with \nthat found in epithermal environments (10\u201355% Ag: Morrison et al., 1991) and contrasts with \norogenic deposits (referred to in Morrison et al., 1991 as \u2018slate belt\u2019 type), which are typically \nassociated with gold with \u2264 20 percent Ag (Morrison et al., 1991). The silver content of \nbedrock gold from Croagh Patrick varies considerably between outcrops (medians are 5.3 and \n14.9 wt % Ag: Chapman et al., 2000). The relatively low-Ag variety (16\u201321 wt %) of gold \nidentified at Bohaun (Table 2) is comparable to the more Ag-rich gold from Croagh Patrick \n(Chapman et al., 2000). The Bohaun gold is less similar to bedrock samples from the \nCregganbaun shear zone (medians for two localities are 8.5 and 10.1 wt % Ag: Chapman et \nal., 2000). Alluvial gold from Croagh Patrick and the Cregganbaun shear zone indicates that a \nwider range of compositions is present. However, in both locations the vast majority of grains \ncontain less than 20 percent Ag and there is no evidence of gold with ~40 percent Ag as \nobserved at Bohaun (Chapman et al., 2000).  \nAlthough Bohaun displays features that are similar in some respects to epithermal deposits \n(Table 6), these systems typically display a close temporal and spatial association with \nsubaerial volcanism and intrusion of calc-alkalic magmas (Simmons et al., 2005), which \nappear to be absent at Bohaun. \nAt Bohaun the lack of deformation and quartz textures indicative of open space growth, at \nrelatively shallow crustal levels are more characteristic of epithermal environments. \nPhanerozoic orogenic gold deposits in metasedimentary terranes rarely display epithermal-\nlike textures (e.g. Nesbitt et al., 1986; Dowling and Morrison, 1990; Herrington and \nWilkinson; 1993; Bierlein and Crow, 2000; Craw et al., 2010). However, it may be \nsignificant that vuggy vein textures interpreted as indicative of open space growth are \nreported from the later quartz generations in the Caledonian age Curraghinalt gold deposit in \nNorthern Ireland (Wilkinson et al., 1999). It is suggested that this is indicative of relatively \nshallow-level development of the mineralization (~<10 km depth: Parnell et al., 2000). \n \nLate stage brines \n \nIreland is an established metallogenic province, well known for the abundance of \ncarbonate-hosted base metal deposits, rather than orogenic gold mineralization. Indeed, it is \n12 \nwell documented that fluids similar to those encountered in Irish-type Zn\u2013Pb deposits have \npenetrated, leached metals from and mineralized the Lower Palaeozoic metasedimentary \nbasement rocks (Russell, 1978; LeHuray et al., 1987; Dixon et al., 1990; Everett et al., 1999a; \nEverett et al., 1999b; Gleeson and Yardley, 2003; Wilkinson et al., 2005; Walshaw et al., \n2006).  \nIrish-type carbonate-hosted base metal deposits are documented in a number of reviews \nand the reader is referred to these for details (e.g. Wilkinson, 2010 and references therein). In \nterms of the features observed at Bohaun the salient characteristics of the mineralization are \ndiscussed below.  \nIn the Lower Palaeozoic metasedimentary basement, it expresses itself as veins within \nSilurian and Ordovician rocks, both below carbonate-hosted deposits and importantly in areas \na considerable distance (>30 km) from known carbonate-hosted mineralization. In a study of \nvein systems developed in Lower Palaeozoic inliers (hosted in Silurian greywackes, \nmudstones and sandstones) of the Irish Midlands, Everett et al. (1999a) report convincing \nevidence for the regional circulation of fluids similar to those observed in carbonate-hosted \nIrish-type Zn\u2013Pb deposits within the Lower Palaeozoic basement. Vein orientations are \nclosely controlled by local brittle faults and are thought to have developed during movement \non these faults. Three veins types are identified, with varying mineralogy: (i) hematitic \ncalcite\u2013quartz \u00b1 pyrite; (ii) quartz\u2013calcite \u00b1 sphalerite, galena, chalcopyrite, pyrite, barite; \nand (iii) ankerite\u2013ferroan dolomite\u2013quartz \u00b1 sphalerite, pyrite. The latter two veins types are \nassociated with weak to locally intense sericite\u2013chlorite-carbonate alteration and sulfides are \nabsent from some of these veins. Veins display subhedral to euhdral crystal development and \nat one locality veins are observed in association with quartz and ankerite cemented \nhydrothermal breccia. Ferroan dolomite and calcite, with minor pyrite and chalcopyrite \nfrequently occur as late vug-fillings. Fluid inclusion data from two of the vein types display \nhomogenization temperatures and salinities in the range of 123 to 238\u00b0C and 9.7 to 20.6 wt \npercent NaCl equiv and support a genetic association with the economic carbonate-hosted \nbase metal mineralization (Everett et al., 1999a). However, neither these veins nor the \ncarbonate-hosted mineralization are known to be auriferous.  \nElsewhere in the Caledonides of the British Isles, base metal mineralization occurs in \nLower Palaeozoic and Dalradian rocks (Samson and Banks, 1988; Pattrick and Russell, 1989; \nTreagus et al., 1999). Notably at some of these localities gold and base metal mineralization \nare spatially associated e.g. the Wanlockhead\u2013Leadhills mining district and Tyndrum in \nScotland. In the Wanlockhead\u2013Leadhills area, base metal mineralization occurs as galena, \nsphalerite and chalcopyrite in association with calcite, dolomite, ankerite, barite, quartz and \npyrite, commonly forming the matrix of vein breccias. The mineralization also contains \nhematite and is thought to be associated with low temperature (<150\u00b0C), high salinity (19\u201330 \nwt. % NaCl equiv) modified meteoric water. A Lower Carboniferous (Dinantian) age is \nproposed for the mineralization (Samson and Banks, 1988). In the Tyndrum area, known for \nits gold mineralization (Earls et al., 1992; Curtis et al., 1993), base metal veins comprise \nquartz and contain galena, sphalerite and barite with minor chalcopyrite. The veins are \nthought to have developed from saline (~15 wt. % NaCl equiv.) fluids at 140 to 200\u00b0C (Curtis \net al., 1993). It is proposed that the base metal mineralization is associated with an Early \nCarboniferous mineralising event (Treagus et al., 1999). The Carboniferous base metal \nmineralization described above is thought to be genetically related and coeval with the \ncarbonate-hosted Zn\u2013Pb deposits of central Ireland (Patrick and Russell, 1989). \nThe following characteristics of the Bohaun deposit suggest that it may have a post-\nCaledonian basinal brine affinity: (i) the proximity of a major Dinantian carbonate basin, \nrepresenting a potential source of saline, basinal brines; (ii) the coincidence of abundant \nveining and jigsaw breccias with a brittle, normal fault suggests the veins developed during \n13 \nmovement of the structures with which they are associated; (iii) fluid inclusion data with \nhomogenization temperature ranging from 145 to 250\u00b0C, and presence of the Type I fluid \nwith moderate to high salinity (8.0\u201323.6 wt % NaCl equiv.), compatible with that observed in \nbase metal mineralization of the Irish Midlands; (iv) the mineralogy of the Bohaun veins, \nparticularly the occurrence of hematite and chlorite with minor sulfides and barite and \ndolomite; (iv) the undeformed nature of the veins is evidence for a post-Caledonian age for \nthe mineralization.  \nWilkinson et al. (1999) present evidence for remobilization of gold by low-temperature, \nhigh-salinity fluids at Curraghinalt. The late brine, which deposited quartz, carbonate, barite \nand base metals sulflides had a modal homogenization temperature of 120\u00baC, salinity of 12\u2013\n21 wt% NaCl equiv, and no identifiable CO2 and is of supposed basinal origin. It is not \napparent whether the late brine introduced new gold or just remobilized pre-existing \nCaledonian mineralization, with the latter suggested as most likely (Parnell et al., 2000: \nWilkinson et al. 1999). Parnell et al. (2000) indicate the later phase of mineralization at \nCurraghinalt is comparable to the base metal mineralization at Tyndrum in Scotland. A \nsimilar fluid to the late brine identified at Curraghinalt is associated with veins crosscutting \nthe Croagh Patrick gold mineralization (Parnell et al., 2000) about 100 km to the south-west. \nThis work suggests basinal brines of the type which caused remobilization of gold at \nCurraghinalt may have been widespread at the time with considerable movement along major \nstructural discontinuities.  \nEvidence for mineralizing events associated with Carboniferous or later fluids in \nConnemara and South Mayo are limited. However, O\u2019Reilly et al. (1997) propose that base \nmetal-bearing veins, containing pyrite with carbonate, barite and minor chlorite\/clay hosted \nwithin the Galway Granite, to the south of Bohaun are associated with a basinal brine from a \nCarboniferous basin. These veins are also comparable to Bohaun in terms of containing \nbrecciated wall rock fragments, comb quartz and vugs. In addition, Jenkin et al. (1998) \ndocument a strong 210 Ma regional fluid event that overprints Carboniferous dikes in the \narea. One of these altered dikes is within 20 km of Bohaun. \nA similar scenario to that proposed for Curraghinalt could be envisaged at Bohaun. \nHowever, there is no evidence for precursor (most likely Caledonian) gold mineralization \nfrom which the gold could have been remobilized, as is clearly evident at Curraghinalt. \nAccordingly, we can only conclude that the fluids identified in the Bohaun mineralization \n(i.e. one low to moderate salinity and the other a moderate to high salinity fluid, at relatively \nlow temperatures) were responsible for transporting and depositing the gold mineralization. \nEvidence for transport of gold by comparable fluids is seen in red-bed Au\u2013Pd mineralization \ne.g. Coronation Hill, Australia (Mernagh et al., 1994); South Devon, UK (Shepherd et al., \n2005); and Bleida Far West, Morocco (Ghorfi et al., 2006). These deposits display \nremarkably similar features to Bohaun, typically including abundant hematite, sulphide-poor \nore mineral assemblages, an association with brittle structures, open-space textures, variable \nto typically strongly saline fluids, at temperatures of <300\u00b0C. Chloritic alteration is also \ndescribed from Bleida Far West (Ghorfi et al., 2006) and Coronation Hill (Mernagh et al., \n1994). In common with Coronation Hill and South Devon, the Bohaun mineralization is \nlocated proximal to major unconformity. However, the corresponding platinum group metals \nand selenide mineral assemblages common in these deposits are absent at Bohaun.  \n \nGenetic model \n \nAlthough hosted in the Caledonian orogenic belt, an orogenic association for the Bohaun \nmineralization is discounted on the basis of fluid inclusion evidence, atypical vein textures \nand gold composition and undeformed veins, providing permissive evidence for a post-\n14 \nCaledonian age. While the mineralization is reminiscent of epithermal mineralization there is \nno obvious magmatic association and alteration is restricted to the veins and the immediate \nhost rocks. Accordingly we favor an association with widespread Carboniferous or later \nmineralizing fluids. A potential source of brines, containing sulfate consistent with the \nmineralogy observed at Bohaun (late carbonate and baryte), is dewatering of proximal \nCarboniferous basin sediments. Fluids of this type would have been available from the \nCarboniferous onwards and have been recognized elsewhere in western Ireland (O\u2019Reilly et \nal., 1997; Jenkin et al., 1998). Evaporites are reported from Carboniferous basins both to the \neast and west of Connemara providing a possible source of sulphate (Anderton et al., 1979; \nRobeson et al., 1988). \nThe Silurian\u2013Dalradian unconformity and the deep fracture zone separating the \nConnemara Dalradian from the Ordovician are likely to represent important regional fluid \npathways. In the neighbouring Zn\u2013Pb province of the Irish Midlands there is clear evidence \nfor regional flow of Lower Carboniferous ore forming fluids within the metasedimentary \nbasement, to depths of >3\u20135 km (Everett et al., 1999a). Furthermore, Caledonian structures in \nthe British Isles are suggested to represent important fluid pathways for Carboniferous \nmetalliferous fluids (Johnston et al., 1996; Baron and Parnell, 2005). In Connermara, \nmetalliferous fluids potentially exploited both pre-existing Caledonian basement structures, \nreactivated in response to regional extension and contemporaneous Variscan structures.  \nThe origin of the gold at Bohaun remains enigmatic: the absence of precursor Caledonian \ngold mineralization precludes remobilization on a deposit scale, suggesting a relatively low-\ntemperature brine has potentially mobilized gold over a significant distance. Links to low-\ntemperature basinal brines similar to those seen in red-bed Au-Pd mineralization or Irish-style \nbase metal deposits seem stronger than an orogenic gold lineage.  \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \nThe Bohaun gold deposit is located in the Caledonian orogenic belt, proximal to a post-\nCaledonian carbonate basin. The mineralization is associated with a normal extensional fault \nsystem, interpreted to represent a zone of repeated extension and vein infilling of open \ncavities in folded, Silurian sedimentary rocks, displaying very low grade metamorphism. The \nmineralization takes the form of undeformed veins, stockworks and breccias and displays \nepithermal-like textures and preservation of open-space, indicative of low confining pressure. \nThe mineralogy consists of quartz-sericite-chlorite with minor sulfides, hematite and gold, \nwith a high silver content and late barite and dolomite. The mineralization displays no \nobvious association with magmatic activity. Two fluids compositions have been identified: \nType I with moderate to high salinity (8.0\u201323.6 wt % NaCl equiv) and Type II with low to \nmoderate salinity (0.0\u20137.8 wt % NaCl equiv). CO2 contents in both fluid types are <3.5 wt \npercent and fluid inclusion homogenization temperatures range from 150 to 220\u00b0C and \ngeologically constrained depth estimates (\u22645 km) indicate maximum fluid inclusion trapping \ntemperatures between 175 and 245\u00b0C. \nAccordingly the Bohaun gold mineralization strongly contrasts with other gold deposits in \nwestern Ireland that are typically orogenic in style. Although mimicking epithermal \nmineralization in a number of respects, an association with relatively low-temperature, \nvariable salinity fluids and a proximal Carboniferous basin favours an association with \nwidespread Carboniferous or later mineralizing fluids.  \nThe origin of the gold at Bohaun is enigmatic. However, we favour a model which \ninvolves transport and deposition of gold from a basinal brine type fluid, in a similar fashion \nto red-bed Au\u2013Pd mineralization (e.g. Shepherd et al., 2005) rather than localized \n15 \nremobilization of orogenic gold mineralization as envisaged for Curraghinalt (e.g. Wilkinson \net al., 1999). Bohaun provides further evidence that low temperature brines may be capable \nof generating economic grade gold mineralization, independent of other fluids. \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n \nWe acknowledge the support of Alba Mineral Resources plc for logistical support during \nfieldwork at the Bohaun deposit and for providing historical data and assay results.
