Introduction \n \nSome metals and metalloids are essential elements (EE) involved in physiological \nand biochemical processes (Abdulla and Chmielnicka, 1990), but can be toxic when \nexposure and assimilation is excessive.  Others, such as lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), arsenic \n(As) and mercury (Hg), are non-essential elements (NEE) that are also potentially toxic. \n 2\n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n66 \nMarine organisms can be exposed to elements from anthropogenic and natural sources, and \nexposure is governed by various factors, including foraging location and trophic position.  \nAlthough the Southern Ocean is a remote environment, it is subject to \nanthropogenic metal inputs due to global transport of elements in the atmosphere and \nthrough oceanic circulation (Gaiero et al., 2003).  Seabirds provide an ideal model with \nwhich to investigate contaminant dynamics in marine food webs (see Gilbertson et al., \n1987; Furness, 1993; Furness and Camphuysen, 1997) and the Procellariiformes exploit a \nwide range of ecological niches in the Southern Ocean.  Many species occupy high trophic \npositions and so can act as sentinels of exposure, highlighting potential threats to other apex \npredators. Previous studies have examined mercury (Hg) and other elements in lower order \nspecies in the Southern Ocean (e.g. Bargagli et al., 1998; Negri et al., 2006) but, apart from \nHg, concentrations of other elements in biota at higher trophic levels have received much \nless attention (although see Lock et al., 1992; Stewart et al., 1999; Gonz\u00e1lez-Sol\u00eds et al., \n2002; Bocher et al., 2003).  \nConventional approaches for quantifying dietary composition and assessing metal \nintake, such as analysis of gut content or regurgitate, have a number of biases (see Votier et \nal., 2003) and samples are often difficult to obtain over long periods. In this study, we \nanalysed stable isotopes to elucidate broad-scale, inter- and intra-specific dietary patterns in \nProcellariiformes (Hobson et al., 1994), and so determine whether differences in foraging \nstrategy explained variation in elemental uptake. Use of stable isotopes for this purpose is \nbased on the predictable increase in the ratio of 15N:14N (by ca. 3.4\u2030) with each trophic \nlevel,, and so \u03b415N can be used as a proxy for trophic position (e.g. DeNiro and Epstein, \n1981; Hobson and Welch, 1992; Bearhop et al., 1999). \u03b413C can vary depending on whether \n 3\n67 \n68 \n69 \n70 \n71 \n72 \n73 \n74 \n75 \n76 \n77 \n78 \n79 \n80 \n81 \n82 \n83 \n84 \n85 \n86 \n87 \n88 \n89 \nanimals feed inshore or offshore, or on benthic or pelagic prey (e.g. Chisholm et al., 1982; \nHobson et al., 1994); \u03b413C values also vary with latitude (Cherel and Hobson, 2007) and, as \nsuch, provide a coarse-scale proxy for foraging location in wide-ranging organisms.  \nThe overarching aim of the present study was to investigate the distributions and \ndynamics of toxic heavy metals, essential metals and metalloids in Southern Ocean \nseabirds, and assess the extent to which they may be bioaccumulated or biomagnified \nthrough foodchains (see Bargagli et al., 1996; McIntyre and Beauchamp, 2007). We \nanalysed red blood cells (hereafter blood) and feathers collected during the breeding season \nto relate element assimilation to trophic position.  The residence times of dietary isotopic \nsignatures are dependent on the regenerative time of the tissue analysed (Hobson and \nClarke, 1992a, 1992b; Hobson 1999). Blood cells are short-term integrators of dietary \nisotope signatures and are derived from prey consumed within the past 2-3 weeks. Blood \nmetal concentrations also reflect recent exposure, concentrations equilibrating between the \nblood and the body organs (Burger and Gochfeld, 1997).  Hence, the isotopic signature and \nelement concentrations in blood are temporally matched and reflect foraging in the \nbreeding season.  In contrast, most Procellariiformes grow feathers during the non-breeding \nperiod and so feathers provide a means for characterising diet and element burdens \nacquired at this time.  Feathers, once grown, are metabolically inert.  They therefore \nprovide a dietary isotope and element exposure \u2018snap-shot\u2019 for the period of feather growth \n(Mizutani et al., 1990, 1992, Bearhop et al., 2002).  By randomly sampling body feathers, \nthe measured isotope signature and element concentration is averaged over the moult period \n(Bearhop et al., 2000). The temporal matching of the feather isotope signature and element \nconcentrations is unlikely to be as good as that for blood because feather data are based on \n 4\n90 \n91 \n92 \n93 \n94 \n95 \n96 \n97 \n98 \n99 \n100 \n101 \n102 \n103 \n105 \n106 \n107 \n108 \n109 \n110 \n111 \naveraged values obtained over a relatively long time period. Overall, however, it is possible \nto gather information on trophic level and foraging range for the breeding (blood stable \nisotopes) and non-breeding season (feather stable isotopes), although it is also important to \ndetermine isotope values for likely prey items (as determined from previous conventional \ndietary studies) so that the extent to which certain prey types may affect metal \naccumulation in birds can also be evaluated.  \nIn this study, our specific objectives were to investigate: (1) current levels of \nexposure of Procellariiformes to a range of EE and NEE by measuring concentrations in \nblood and feathers; (2) the extent to which assimilation varies between species; and, (3) the \nextent to which foraging area, diet, and trophic level explains intra- and inter-individual \nvariation in metal accumulation in Procellariiformes.   \n \n2.  Materials and methods  \n \n2.1 Sample collection and preparation 104 \n \nFieldwork was undertaken on Bird Island, South Georgia (54\u00ba 00\u2019S, 38\u00ba 03\u2019W) from \nDecember 2001 for a period of four months. Ten species were sampled in total: Antarctic \nprion (Pachyptila desolata), black-browed albatross (Thalassarche melanophrys), blue \npetrel (Halobaena caerulea), common diving petrel (Pelecanoides urinatrix), South \nGeorgian diving petrel (Pelecanoides georgicus), grey-headed albatross (T. chrysostoma), \nnorthern giant petrel (Macronectes halli), southern giant petrel (M. giganteus), white-\n 5\nchinned petrel (Procellaria aequinoctialis) and wandering albatross (Diomedea exulans). \nBlood and feathers from adults of each species were taken from surface-nesting birds at the \nend of the brood-guard period and from burrowing birds whilst mist-netting adjacent to \nbreeding colonies. Whole blood (0.2-1.0ml) (from the tarsal vein) was spun to separate \ncells and plasma, immediately frozen, subsequently freeze-dried to a constant mass and \nthen again frozen until analysis. Only red blood cells were analysed for isotopes and trace \nelements. Six to 8 feathers sampled at random were taken from the mantle region of each \nbird. Feathers were stored in plastic bags at room temperature until analysed.  Fresh prey \nsamples (muscle tissue) were obtained from seabird regurgitates, or from fisheries vessels \noperating in waters surrounding South Georgia, and frozen at -20\u00b0C after identification. \nCephalopods were identified from beaks according to Clarke (1986) and Rodhouse et al. \n(1992), fish from external morphology according to Gon and Heemstra (1990), or from \notloliths according to Reid (1996), and crustaceans from Kirkwood (1984). Identifications \nwere checked against BAS reference collections. Prey were of unknown size and age. \n112 \n113 \n114 \n115 \n116 \n117 \n118 \n119 \n120 \n121 \n122 \n123 \n124 \n125 \n126 \n128 \n129 \n130 \n131 \n132 \n133 \n134 \n \n2.2 Stable isotope analyses 127 \n \nAll blood and feather samples were homogenised in a freezer mill prior to analysis \nand oven-dried for >24hrs at 50\u00baC to a constant mass. In the case of prey samples, lipids \nwere extracted prior to SIA over a 4 hour period using Soxhlet apparatus containing 1:1 \nmethanol to chloroform solvent mixture. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses were \nperformed by continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry (CF-IRMS) on 0.7mg sub-\nsamples of material loaded into tin cups and combusted in a Costech ECS 4010 elemental \n 6\n135 \n136 \n137 \n138 \n139 \n140 \n141 \n142 \n143 \n144 \n145 \n147 \n148 \n149 \n150 \n151 \n152 \n153 \n154 \n155 \n156 \n157 \nanalyser coupled to a Thermo Finnigan Delta Plus XP mass spectrometer. Every 8-10 \nsamples were followed by two laboratory standards allowing correction for drift. Isotope \nratios are expressed in standard \u03b4 notation against international reference standards, vPDB \n(virtual Pee Dee Belemnite) for \u03b413C and atmospheric nitrogen for \u03b415N according to the \nequation: \n \n\u03b4X = [(Rsample\/Rstandard) \u2013 1] \u00d7 1000 \n \nwhere X  is 15N or 13C and R is the corresponding ratio 15N:14N or 13C:12C. Precision for \nboth \u03b413C and \u03b415N was routinely estimated to be \u2264 0.2\u2030.  \n \n2.3 Element analyses 146 \n \nSamples were oven-dried for 24hrs at 50\u00baC to a constant mass. Between 0.05 and \n0.1g dry weight of sample (mean weights for each tissue type; 0.6g for prey, 0.09g for \nblood, and 0.05g for feathers) was weighed accurately and added to 2ml nitric acid and left \nto cold digest for 24hrs. Samples were then hot digested for 50 minutes at 120\u00baC, after \nwhich 0.5ml of hydrogen peroxide was added and left for a final 15 minutes. The samples \nwere made up to 5ml with deionised water. Total absolute concentrations for 22 essential \nand non-essential elements were measured using an ELAN 6100 dynamic reaction cell \ninductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (DRC ICP-MS) (PerkinElmer, Connecticut, \nUS) with a reference material and internal standard run with every 10 unknowns.  Spiked \nsamples and blanks were also run. Limits of detection (LoD) for particular elements are in \n 7\n158 \n159 \n160 \n161 \n162 \n164 \n165 \n166 \n167 \n168 \n169 \n170 \n171 \n172 \n173 \n174 \n175 \n176 \n177 \n178 \n179 \n180 \nTable 1. Precision and accuracy (Table 2) were measured using replicate samples and \ncertified reference material (TORT-2 lobster hepatopancreas, NRCC, Canada). Element \nconcentrations are expressed throughout as mean \u00b1 SD in ng.g-1 on a dry weight basis, \nunless otherwise specified. \n \n2.4 Data analyses  163 \n \nElements with mean concentrations below LoD (beryllium (Be) for prey; aluminium \n(Al), scandium (Sc), cobalt (Co), zinc (Zn), antimony (Sb), tungsten (W), and Be for blood; \nand Sc, caesium (Cs), lithium (Li), Pb, and Be for feathers) are reported in the summary \nstatistics but are excluded from further consideration or statistical analyses. Among the \nremaining elements, concentrations in some samples in some species were below the LoD \n(maximum 13% of samples for rubidium (Rb) in feathers, 1-3% of samples for vanadium \n(V), iron (Fe), molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni), Cs, Hg, manganese (Mn), and selenium (Se) \nin various tissue types) and were assigned a value equal to half the LoD for the particular \ntissue. Where element concentrations were below the LoD in >30% of samples overall for a \nparticular tissue type (V, barium (Ba), uranium (U), Li, and Pb for blood; V, Sb, and W for \nfeathers), those elements were also included in summary statistics but excluded from \nsubsequent statistical analyses, as in other studies (Borg\u00e5 et al., 2006).  Fe was excluded \nfrom all statistical analyses of blood data because of its physiological function in this tissue. \nFor elements that were included in the statistical analysis, we first used principal \ncomponent analyses (PCA) in Canoco 4.5 for Windows\u00ae to identify co-variance among \nelements, and between elements and isotope ratios (the latter entered as passive variables, \n 8\n181 \n182 \n183 \n184 \n185 \n186 \n187 \n188 \n189 \n190 \n191 \n192 \n193 \n194 \n195 \n196 \n197 \n198 \n199 \n200 \n201 \n202 \nfollowing Borg\u00e5 et al., 2006) in seabird tissues. PCA produces ordination axes that reduce \nthe total residual sum of squares among all the variables included (i.e. all elements, \u03b415N, \nand \u03b413C). The primary axis (PC1) represents the greatest proportion of component \nvariation among the samples. The secondary axis (PC2) explains the greatest proportion of \nany remaining variation that is uncorrelated with PC1. Variables are shown as lines, with \nthe length of each line demonstrating relative contribution of a particular variable to the \nseparation of samples in ordination space. Angles between lines represent a greater or lesser \ndegree of co-variance between elements; with acute angles representing the greatest degree \nof co-variance, a 180\u00ba angle demonstrating a negative correlation, and a 90\u00ba angle represent \nelements that are completely un-correlated. All PCA were performed on standardised \nvalues, so that those elements with vastly different ranges could be analysed together. We \nthen used univariate general linear models (GLMs) to test the significance of relationships \nbetween species, \u03b415N, \u03b413C, and elements of high factor loadings that were identified \nthrough PCA, (elements with \u2265 0.50 factor loadings for PC1 and\/or PC2). These analyses \nwere applied to both blood and feather data separately and the most parsimonious \nunivariate models were determined using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) (Akaike \n1973). Absolute element concentrations were logarithmically transformed (log10) in some \ninstances to reduce skewness and heterogeneity.  Model residuals were also examined by \nway of Q-Q plots to assess goodness of fit. Statistical tests were performed in statistical \npackages R ver. 2.6.2 and SPSS\u00ae ver. 14.  \n \n3.

Mercury \nwas detected in all three tissue types but, because of the particular biomagnification \nproperties and risks associated with this element, the results have been examined in greater \ndetail and reported elsewhere; essentially, mercury levels were found to increase with \ntrophic level, indicating strong biomagnification among Procellariiformes (Anderson et al. \n2009). Fourteen elements were quantifiable in blood (Table 3) and seventeen in feathers \n(Table 4). Species varied in the extent to which they accumulated different elements and no \nsingle species accumulated the highest concentrations of all elements (Tables 3-5). Of all \nthe elements, Fe and Se had the highest concentrations in blood (Table 3), and Fe and Zn \nthe highest concentrations in feathers (Table 4).  \nIn prey samples, 21 elements were detected, only Be was below detection limits.  \nIron and Zn had the highest concentrations of all elements tested for (Table 5). Aluminium \nconcentrations were generally an order of magnitude higher in crustaceans than in fish and \ncephalopods, and Cd concentrations were likewise some 10-fold higher in several squid \nspecies and in Themisto gaudichaudii, compared with other species (Table 5). Benthic-\nfeeding fish, such as Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) (Garc\u00eda de la Rosa et \nal., 1997), often had the highest As concentrations. Isotopic analyses indicated a high \ndegree of variation in trophic position (\u03b415N) and foraging range (\u03b413C) between seabird \nspecies (Fig. 1), and considerable trophic overlap between fish and cephalopod prey.  The \ngreatest degree of spatial variation (largest range in \u03b413C ratios) in prey was between fish \nspecies (Fig. 1). \n 10\n225 \n226 \n227 \n228 \n229 \n230 \n231 \n232 \n233 \n234 \n235 \n236 \n237 \n238 \n239 \n240 \n241 \n242 \n243 \n244 \n245 \n246 \nInitial PCA analyses identified strong associations between As concentrations and \nboth \u03b415N and \u03b413C in blood (Fig. 2a).  There was a similar but weaker association for \ncaesium (Cs), as indicated by the shorter line on the PCA plot (Fig. 2a), but no similar \nassociations for other elements in blood. The distribution of As in ordination space was \npredominantly governed by white-chinned petrel, suggesting that blood As concentrations \nwere elevated in this species during the breeding season; this association did not occur in \nfeathers (Fig. 2b). There were other similar associations between specific elements and \nseabird species.  The positions of Rb and Cd in ordination space were largely governed by \ngrey-headed albatross, indicating that blood concentrations of these elements were highest \nin this species during the breeding season (Fig. 2a); again there were no such associations \nfor feathers (Fig. 2b). The ordinal positions of white-chinned petrel and wandering \nalbatross were influenced by \u03b415N and \u03b413C in both blood and feathers. Overall, As and Cd \n(NEE) contributed most to PC1 in blood, while Se (EE), Rb (NEE), and Mo (EE) \ncontributed most to PC2 (Table 2, supplementary material). In contrast, Mn (EE), Fe (EE), \nCo (EE), As (NEE), and Mo (EE) contributed most to PC1 in feathers, while Se and U \n(NEE) contributed most to PC2. \nWith the exception of blood As, all elements contributing \u22650.50 to factor loadings \nin the PCA were found to differ significantly between seabird species (Table 6). Univariate \nGLM analyses identified significant differences between species for a number of elements. \nBlood concentrations of Cd, Se, Rb, and Mo all differed significantly between species \n(Table 6), and in feathers, significant differences between species were found in the levels \nof Mn, Fe, Co, As, Mo, Se, and U. \n 11\n247 \n248 \n249 \n250 \n251 \n252 \n253 \n254 \n255 \n256 \n257 \n258 \n259 \n260 \n261 \n262 \n263 \n264 \n265 \n266 \n267 \n268 \nUnivariate GLMs demonstrated that there was a significant and positive association \nbetween As and \u03b415N in blood, although the pattern of this relationship varied between \nspecies, as demonstrated by the significant interaction term in the model (Table 6). Blood \nAs concentrations were negatively associated with \u03b413C across all species (i.e., at \ncommunity level, Table 6) but the exact nature of this relationship may also have varied \nbetween species, the interaction term in the model approaching significance (Table 6).  \nThere was a significant relationship between Se and \u03b413C in feathers (Table 6). There were \nno other significant relationships between element concentrations and trophic position \nand\/or foraging location in either tissue type (Table 6). \nThe positive association between blood As concentrations and trophic position \n(\u03b415N) was consistent with the concept that As is bioconcentrated along food chains. To \ninvestigate this further, we examined how As concentrations in prey species varied with \n\u03b415N and \u03b413C values (Table 7). Arsenic concentrations differed significantly between \ntaxonomic groups but also varied with \u03b415N (Table 7). However, associations between \u03b415N \nand As concentrations were not consistent between prey groups (Table 7), indicating that \nassociations between the trophic position of species and As are complex (Fig. 3). \n  \n4.  Discussion \n \n The large number of elements analysed in this study required us to focus the \ndiscussion only on those elements for which a significant relationship was identified among \nthe parameters in the univariate analyses. We have also focused particularly on those \n 12\n269 \n270 \n271 \n272 \n273 \n274 \n275 \n276 \n278 \n279 \n280 \n281 \n282 \n283 \n284 \n285 \n286 \n287 \n288 \n289 \n290 \n291 \nelements for which a significant relationship occurred in blood as blood is the better tissue \nfor characterising trophic and spatial patterns in relation to element composition within \nthese birds. This is because feathers have the potential to acquire element burdens both \ndirectly through diet and from remobilisation of elements from internal tissues (Lewis and \nFurness, 1991; Monteiro, 1996). This may be why the relationships identified between \nstable isotope ratios and elements in blood in the present study were not always mirrored \nwith feathers. \n \n4.1 Arsenic 277 \n \nOf the elements analysed in seabird blood, only As showed significant interactions \nwith \u03b415N and \u03b413C at the community level (Table 6), suggesting that trophic position \nand\/or foraging range affect As assimilation by Procellariiformes during the breeding \nseason.  The significant and positive association between blood As and \u03b415N may be due to \nbioconcentration or reflect changes in isotopic baseline that coincide with variation in \nenvironmental As concentrations. We found no evidence of bioconcentration of As through \nthe foodchain. Although As concentrations varied significantly between prey groups \n(crustacea, cephalopods, and fish), there was no consistent relationship between As \nconcentrations and trophic position in prey (Table 7, Fig. 3).  \nGiven the lack of clear evidence of bioconcentration, it is possible that foraging \nlocation is the prime factor affecting As assimilation in Procellariiformes during the \nbreeding season, and any associations with \u03b415N may be coincidental. In this respect, As \nstrongly influenced the position of white-chinned petrel in the PCA ordination space (Fig. \n 13\n2a), reflecting their high blood As concentrations (2500 ng g-1 dry weight) relative both to \nother species in this study and to other species elsewhere; reference values for blood As in \nbirds from uncontaminated areas is 20 ng g-1 wet weight (Burger and Gochfeld, 1997), \napproximately equivalent to a dry weight red blood cell concentration of 400 ng g-1.   \nWhite-chinned petrels have amongst the greatest foraging distances of any seabird and \nbreeding birds from South Georgia regularly forage on the northern Patagonian shelf, \n>2000km from the colony (Phillips et al., 2006). Prey food webs on the Patagonian shelf \nhave greater trophic complexity than those in waters around South Georgia (Forero et al., \n2004, 2005), and so \u03b415N levels in birds feeding in that region may be elevated, reflecting \nlonger food chain lengths. The Patagonian shelf region is also more likely to be subject to \ngreater anthropogenic inputs from riverine influxes, mineral activities, and industry than the \nmore remote regions of the Southern Ocean (Gonz\u00e1lez-Sol\u00eds et al., 2002), which could \nexplain the elevated arsenic levels in birds that feed there. It is also possible, however, that \nenhanced environmental exposure to As may stem from natural processes.  For example, \ndisruption in the phosphorus\/nitrogen ratio could lead to greater As accumulation by \nphytoplankton in a particular region and subsequently enhance As levels in the food chain.   \n292 \n293 \n294 \n295 \n296 \n297 \n298 \n299 \n300 \n301 \n302 \n303 \n304 \n305 \n306 \n307 \n308 \n309 \n310 \n311 \n312 \n313 \n314 \nIn our study, there was no relationship between feather As concentrations and \u03b415N. \nFeather As concentrations were highest in Antarctic prion (APR), but only about half the \nconcentrations measured in black-footed albatross (Phoebastria nigripes) feathers from the \nNorth Pacific (Fujihara et al., 2004). Low feather As concentrations in Antarctic \nProcellariiformes may reflect exposure during the non-breeding season to relatively low-\nlevel natural levels of As. In our study, As concentrations in prey tended to be highest in \nbenthic\/demersal species (Table 5). This suggests that a major source of As in the prey of \n 14\n315 \n316 \n317 \n318 \n319 \n320 \n321 \n322 \n323 \n324 \n325 \n326 \n327 \n328 \n329 \n330 \n331 \n332 \n333 \n335 \n336 \n337 \nAntarctic Procellariiformes around South Georgia may stem from metallic mineralisation of \nthe seabed rather than from atmospheric transport of particles. Indeed, marine sediments are \nthought to be the largest geochemical reservoir of arsenic with residence times of ca. 100 \nmillion years (Maher and Butler 1988).  Furthermore, manganese (Mn) concentrations were \nalso elevated in benthic species, again suggesting a natural source of As; elevated As levels \nwithout matching high levels of Mn are thought to be indicative of anthropogenic As input \n(Peterson and Carpenter, 1986).  \nAlthough there was a significant relationship between \u03b413C and blood As \nconcentrations in the Procellariiformes in our study, no such relationship occurred among \nprey species. This may be because prey were collected from a small geographic area, \nrelative to the foraging areas of the birds. However, there was still considerable variation in \n\u03b413C ratios between prey species (Fig. 1) and this probably reflects the influence of depth \non prey \u03b413C ratios. The lack of association between \u03b413C and As in prey indicates that As \nuptake by seabirds is unlikely to be influenced by the proportion of mesopelagic prey in the \ndiet, unlike patterns of Hg uptake which are heavily influenced by prey type (see Monteiro \net al., 1996; Thompson et al., 1998). The association observed between \u03b413C and As in \nProcellariiformes is most likely due to geographical variation in background As \nconcentrations within the marine environment. \n \n4.2 Cadmium 334 \n \nBlood cadmium concentrations in seabirds varied significantly between species but \nnot with isotopic signatures, indicating that neither trophic position nor foraging location \n 15\n338 \n339 \n340 \n341 \n342 \n343 \n344 \n345 \n346 \n347 \n348 \n349 \n350 \n351 \n352 \n353 \n354 \n355 \n356 \n357 \n358 \n359 \ndictated Cd burdens during the breeding season. Our results match those of Gonzalez-Solis \net al. (2002) in that Cd concentrations were greater in northern than southern giant petrels \n(Table 3). Gonzalez-Solis et al. (2002) postulated that the former are exposed to higher \nlevels through foraging over the Patagonian shelf, as the region is thought to be more \nexposed to heavy metal contamination than the waters immediately adjacent to South \nGeorgia. However, if latitudinal variation in foraging location was the major factor \naffecting Cd assimilation in Antarctic Procellariiformes, we would anticipate a correlation \nbetween Cd concentrations in birds and \u03b413C. It may be that foraging location does dictate \nCd uptake, but that any such influence reflects the existence of Cd \u2018hot spots\u2019 rather than a \nlatitudinal gradient per se. In fact, Nyg\u00e5rd et al. (2001) linked deep ocean upwelling, which \nis often naturally Cd-rich (Holm-Hansen, 1985), to high Cd concentrations in Antarctic krill \nEuphausia superba and other prey of Procellariiform seabirds (Petri and Zauke, 1993). \nPrevious studies have attributed high Cd concentrations in Procellariiformes to \nconsumption of squid (Muirhead and Furness, 1988; Honda and Marcovecchio, 1990; \nElliott, 2005; Stewart et al., 1999). Our results support this, in that higher Cd levels were \nfound in the blood of grey-headed albatrosses and white-chinned petrels (Table 3). Both \nwhite-chinned petrels and grey-headed albatrosses from South Georgia consume large \namounts of squid, the latter feeding in particular on Martialia hyadesi, and, also on lamprey \nGeotria australis (Berrow and Croxall, 1999, Xavier et al., 2003). In our study, both these \nprey types had relatively elevated Cd concentrations (Table 5). Hence, high Cd burdens in \nProcellariiformes do not necessarily indicate anthropogenic contamination. Levels of \ncadmium in feathers, for example, were largely similar to those in similar species, e.g. \n 16\nblack-footed and Laysan albatrosses (Phoebastria immutabilis) in the more contaminated \nNorth Pacific (Burger and Gochfeld, 2000). \n360 \n361 \n362 \n363 \n364 \n365 \n366 \n367 \n368 \n369 \n370 \n371 \n372 \n373 \n375 \n376 \n377 \n378 \n379 \n380 \n381 \n382 \nSquid are thought to accumulate high Cd concentrations naturally (Kurihara et al., \n1993; Gerpe et al., 2000). Elevated burdens in Procellariiformes can also result from \namphipod consumption (Cheng et al., 1984; Elliott and Scheuhammer, 1997), and in our \nstudy, it was notable that we recorded the highest Cd levels of any prey item in Themisto \ngaudichaudii (Table 5). Rainbow (1989) concluded that Themisto species are a significant \nsource of Cd in the diets of some seabirds, and our findings are consistent with this as the \nhighest blood Cd levels in birds in our study were in blue petrels, a known predator of T. \ngaudichaudii (Prince, 1980). Moreover, hyperiid amphipods may also contribute to the diet \nof some squid species (Croxall and Prince, 1980) which can then be eaten by seabirds.  \nThus, dietary preferences, rather than foraging area, may comprise the dominant influence \non Cd burdens in Procellariiformes. \n \n4.3 Selenium 374 \n \nBlood (hence breeding season) concentrations of Se, an essential element, varied \nsignificantly between seabird species, but did not show a significant relationship with \ntrophic position (\u03b415N) and foraging location (\u03b413C) (Table 6). Therefore, it seems probable \nthat Se does not biomagnify among Procellariiformes. Additionally, our data suggest that \nforaging location does not dictate Se burdens in Southern Ocean Procellariiformes, \nalthough this may in fact reflect the constrained foraging ranges of many species during the \nbreeding season rather than a true absence of association between the two parameters. \n 17\n383 \n384 \n385 \n386 \n387 \n388 \n389 \n390 \n391 \n392 \n393 \n394 \n395 \n396 \n397 \n398 \n399 \n400 \n401 \n402 \n403 \n404 \nSelenium concentrations were the highest of any element in Procellariiformes blood except \nFe. Moreover, blood Se levels in both giant petrel species were consistent with those \npreviously recorded by Gonz\u00e1lez-Sol\u00eds et al. (2002). Blue petrels and Antarctic prions had \nthe highest blood Se concentrations of the birds we analysed and both species feed \npredominantly on crustacea, including Antarctic krill (Prince, 1980; Croxall et al., 1997). \nOf the prey species we analysed, crustacea, especially Antarctic krill and T. gaudichaudii, \nhad high Se concentrations relative to other prey species and groups. The physico-chemical \nform in which Se is sequestered by different prey may also vary and affect subsequent \nbioavailability. Hence, it would appear that inter-specific variation in blood Se \nconcentrations in seabirds most likely reflects species differences in prey selection.  \nSelenium concentrations in feathers varied considerably between species and were \nalso significantly and negatively related to foraging location (i.e. \u03b413C) (Table 6). This was \nunexpected as concentrations of Se might be expected to increase with decreasing latitude, \nas birds move into potentially more contaminated waters north of the sub-Antarctic polar \nfront. The negative relationship in this instance is difficult to explain, but could potentially \nstem from natural sources of Se being more elevated in specific regions closer to the \nAntarctic continent. In other words, Se burdens accumulated by Procellariiformes in the \nnon-breeding period may be dictated by naturally occurring Se in the marine environment, \npotentially stemming from Antarctic intermediate and bottom waters which are sporadically \nrich in organic Se (Cutter and Cutter, 2001). Evidence to support this hypothesis, comes \nfrom the comparable levels of Se in the species covered by this study, to those of other \nstudies. Burger and Gochfeld (2000) examined Se in feathers from black-footed and Laysan \n 18\n405 \n406 \n407 \n409 \n410 \n411 \n412 \n413 \n414 \n415 \n416 \n417 \n418 \n419 \n420 \n421 \n422 \n423 \n424 \n425 \n426 \nalbatrosses in the North Pacific, and identified levels comparable to those found in this \nstudy. \n \n4.4 Rubidium and Molybdenum 408 \n \nTwo other elements, Rb and Mo, also varied between seabird species, but not with \neither \u03b415N or \u03b413C, indicating that trophic position and foraging location were not key \ndeterminants in the distribution of these two elements within Procellariiformes. Rb is \nknown to bioaccumulate through the foodchain (Nyholm and Tyler, 2000), and in fact, \nCampbell et al. (2005) reported a significant correlation between Rb and \u03b415N in marine \norganisms, potentially suggesting biomagnification. While our results were not significant \nin the presence of other parameters, there was a significant, albeit weak, positive \nrelationship between Rb and \u03b415N in blood (linear regression, F1,140 = 9.9, p = 0.002, r2 = \n0.07). However, whether this is evidence of biomagnification of Rb within this particular \nsystem is doubtful given there was no significant relationship between Rb concentrations \nand \u03b415N in prey (linear regression, F1,82 = 1.5, p = 0.229, r2 = 0.02). Given that the \naccumulated evidence concerning Rb bioconcentration through foodchains is unclear, \nfurther investigations into Rb distributions and bioaccumulation in the marine environment \nappear warranted.  \n \n5.  Conclusions \n \n 19\n427 \n428 \n429 \n430 \n431 \n432 \n433 \n434 \n435 \n436 \n437 \n438 \n439 \n440 \n441 \n442 \n443 \n444 \n445 \n446 \n447 \n448 \nThis study presents new data on the distributions and dynamics of heavy metals, \nessential metals and metalloids in Southern Ocean seabirds. Our results indicate that there \nare considerable differences in residues accumulated by different species. For arsenic, \nresidues in Procellariiformes appear to be partially explained by changes in foraging range \nand trophic positioning, although these patterns were not always consistent across species. \nArsenic was accumulated at higher concentrations in Procellariiformes feeding at higher \ntrophic levels, although this may be confounded to some extent by individuals foraging \nacross different food webs with varying \u03b415N baselines.  There was little or no evidence that \ntrophic level was important in the accumulation of other elements.  Our data suggest that \ndifferences between species in feeding preferences for prey and the location of the foraging \nsites are the likely major factors determining element uptake by seabirds in the South \nAtlantic.   \n \n6.
