MARTIN LINDSAY AND ADAM G. SKALSKI\nAbstract. Convolution semigroups of states on a quantum group form the\nnatural noncommutative analogue of convolution semigroups of probability\nmeasures on a locally compact group. Here we initiate a theory of weakly\ncontinuous convolution semigroups of functionals on a C\u2217-bialgebra, the non-\ncommutative counterpart of a locally compact semigroup. On locally compact\nquantum groups we obtain a bijective correspondence between such convo-\nlution semigroups and a class of C0-semigroups of maps which we charac-\nterise. On C\u2217-bialgebras of discrete type we show that all weakly continuous\nconvolution semigroups of states are automatically norm-continuous. As an\napplication we deduce a known characterisation of continuous conditionally\npositive-definite Hermitian functions on a compact group.\nIntroduction\nConvolution semigroups of probability measures on locally compact groups, and\nsemigroups, play an important role in both probability theory and functional anal-\nysis. They underpin all approaches to stochastic processes with independent identi-\ncally distributed increments, that is Le\u00b4vy processes ([Ber]). The analysis of convo-\nlution semigroups is also an independent area of research, well documented in the\nmonograph [Hey]. Given the recent development of a satisfactory theory of locally\ncompact quantum groups ([KuV]) it is natural to investigate convolution semi-\ngroups of states on such objects\u2014states being the noncommutative counterpart of\nprobability measures.\nWe recently introduced the notion of quantum Le\u00b4vy process on a locally com-\npact quantum semigroup, in other words a C\u2217-bialgebra ([LS2]). As in the classical\ntheory of Le\u00b4vy processes, and the earlier noncommutative theory of Le\u00b4vy processes\non purely algebraic quantum semigroups ([Sch]), the concept of a convolution semi-\ngroup of states plays a fundamental role here too. In our papers the strongest\nresults are obtained under the assumption that the Markov semigroup of the pro-\ncess is norm-continuous. By one form of analogy, the class of processes investigated\nthere may thereby be viewed as a quantum analogue of the class of compound\nPoisson processes.\nThe present paper forms the first step in analysing general quantum Le\u00b4vy pro-\ncesses in the analytic context. We initiate a theory of weakly continuous convolution\nsemigroups of functionals on locally compact quantum semigroups. In particular we\nprove that, on C\u2217-bialgebras enjoying a \u2018residual vanishing at infinity\u2019 property\u2014\nwhich is satisfied by all locally compact quantum groups, every weakly continuous\nconvolution semigroup of functionals induces a C0-semigroup on the algebra. From\na probabilistic viewpoint this amounts to a Feller property ([Jac])). We give several\ncharacterisations of the resulting class of C0-semigroups. We also prove that on C\n\u2217-\nbialgebras of discrete type weak continuity for a convolution semigroup of states\n1\nimplies norm-continuity. Here slice maps for non-normal functionals, in the sense\nof Tomiyama ([Tom]), play a crucial role. Our results show that all quantum Le\u00b4vy\nprocesses on a discrete quantum semigroup are automatically of the type thoroughly\nstudied in [LS2]. As an application we prove a result of Guichardet, characteris-\ning the continuous conditionally positive-definite Hermitian functions on a compact\ngroup ([Gui]).\n1. Preliminaries\nGiven C\u2217-algebras A and C, their spatial\/minimal (respectively algebraic) tensor\nproduct will be denoted A\u2297C (resp. A\u2299C) and the multiplier algebra of A will be\ndenoted byM(A). The multiplier algebra is equipped with the strict topology, with\nrespect to which the unit ball of A is dense in that of M(A). A linear map T from\nA (or M(A)) to M(C) is strict if it is bounded and strictly continuous on bounded\nsubsets of A (respectively M(A)). Standard examples of strict maps include \u2217-\nhomomorphisms which are nondegenerate (that is T (A)C is total in C), continuous\nlinear functionals on A and, more generally, slice maps of the type \u00b5\u2297 idC : A\u2297C \u2192\nC \u2282 M(C), where \u00b5 \u2208 A\u2217. The collection of strict linear functionals on M(A)\nforms a closed subspace of M(A)\u2217 which we denote by M(A)\u2217\u03b2 . An important\nproperty of strict maps T : A \u2192M(C) is that they possess a unique strict extension\nT\u02dc :M(A)\u2192M(C); the extension procedure does not change the norm (or cb-norm\nif T is completely bounded) and preserves (complete) positivity. In particular, strict\nextension defines an isometric isomorphism A\u2217 \u2192M(A)\u2217\u03b2 mapping states to states.\nA strict map T is called preunital if its strict extension is unital: T\u02dc (1) = 1. Thus\nall states are preunital, as are nondegenerate *-homomorphisms. The existence and\nuniqueness of extensions allows composition of strict maps T : A1 \u2192 M(A2) and\nS : A2 \u2192 M(A3), with the resulting map A1 \u2192 M(A3) being strict. Finally, for\nstrict completely positive maps Ti : Ai \u2192 Ci (i = 1, 2), their tensor product map\nT1\u2297T2 : A1\u2297A2 \u2192M(C1)\u2297M(C2) \u2282M(C1\u2297C2), is strict. For more information\non multiplier algebras, strict maps, their tensor products and extensions, we refer\nto [Lan], [Ku1] and [LS2].\nBy a semigroup on A, or M(A), we mean a one-parameter family of bounded\noperators (Pt)t\u22650 satisfying Ps+t = PsPt and P0 = idA (no continuity in t is assumed\na priori). We call it a strict\/completely bounded\/completely positive semigroup if\neach map Pt has that property. By elementary semigroup theory ([Dav], Proposition\n1.23), (Pt)t\u22650 is a C0-semigroup, i.e. it is strongly continuous in t, if it is weakly\ncontinuous, that is t 7\u2192 \u00b5(Pt(a)) is continuous for each a \u2208 A and \u00b5 \u2208 A\n\u2217, at t = 0.\nWe shall need two general results, in Sections 2 and 4 respectively. The first\nconcerns the preservation of pointwise convergence under strict extension.\nProposition 1.1. Let (\u03c9\u03bb)\u03bb\u2208\u039b be a net of states on a C\n\u2217-algebra A converging\npointwise to a state \u03c9 on A. Then (\u03c9\u02dc\u03bb)\u03bb\u2208\u039b converges pointwise to \u03c9\u02dc.\nProof. Let m \u2208M(A) and let (ei)i\u2208I be an approximate unit for A. Then, for each\ni \u2208 I,\n\u03c9\u02dc\u03bb((1 \u2212 ei)\n2) = 1 + \u03c9\u03bb(e\n2\ni \u2212 2ei)\n\u03bb\n\u2212\u2192 1 + \u03c9(e2i \u2212 2ei) = \u03c9\u02dc((1 \u2212 ei)\n2)\n2\nand so, by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for states,\n|(\u03c9\u02dc\u03bb \u2212 \u03c9\u02dc)(m)| \u2264 |\u03c9\u02dc\u03bb(m(1\u2212 ei))|+ |\u03c9\u02dc(m(1 \u2212 ei))|+ |(\u03c9\u03bb \u2212 \u03c9)(mei)|\n\u2264 \u2016m\u2016(\u03c9\u02dc\u03bb((1\u2212 ei)\n2))\n1\n2 + \u2016m\u2016(\u03c9\u02dc((1 \u2212 ei)\n2))\n1\n2 + |(\u03c9\u03bb \u2212 \u03c9)(mei)|\n\u03bb\n\u2212\u2192 2\u2016m\u2016\u03c9\u02dc\n(\n(1\u2212 ei)\n2\n)1\/2\n.\nSince\n(\n(1 \u2212 ei)\n2\n)\ni\u2208I\nconverges strictly to 0, the result follows. \u0003\nRemark. Using Kadison-Schwarz, instead of Cauchy-Schwarz, the above proof re-\nmains valid for strict completely positive preunital maps into the multiplier algebra\nof another C\u2217-algebra (T\u03bb : A \u2192 M(C))\u03bb\u2208\u039b converging pointwise to another such\nmap T .\nThe following observation is due to Tomiyama ([Tom]); we include its elementary\nproof for the convenience of the reader. The notation \u2297 is used for ultraweak tensor\nproducts of von Neumann algebras and ultraweakly continuous slice maps ([KaR]).\nProposition 1.2. Let M = M1\u2297M2, for von Neumann algebras M1 and M2, and\nlet \u03bd \u2208 (M1)\n\u2217. Then there is a unique map \u03bd \u2297M id2 : M \u2192 M2 satisfying\n\u03d5 \u25e6 (\u03bd \u2297M id2) = \u03bd \u25e6 (id1\u2297\u03d5), \u03d5 \u2208 (M2)\u2217, (1.1)\nwhere idi denotes the identity map on Mi (i = 1, 2). Moreover, \u03bd \u2297M id2 is a\nbounded operator of norm \u2016\u03bd\u2016.\nProof. Let x \u2208 M. Then, for \u03d5 \u2208 (M2)\u2217,\u2223\u2223\u03bd((id1\u2297\u03d5)(x))\u2223\u2223 \u2264 \u2016\u03bd\u2016\u2225\u2225id1\u2297\u03d5\u2225\u2225\u2016x\u2016 = \u2016\u03bd\u2016\u2016\u03d5\u2016\u2016x\u2016\nso the prescription \u03d5 7\u2192 \u03bd((id1\u2297\u03d5)(x)) defines a bounded linear functional on\n(M2)\u2217 of norm at most \u2016\u03bd\u2016\u2016x\u2016. Therefore, invoking the canonical identification\nof ((M2)\u2217)\n\u2217 with M2, there is a bounded operator \u03bd \u2297M id2 : M \u2192 M2, of norm\nat most \u2016\u03bd\u2016, satisfying (1.1). Since \u03bd \u2297M id2 clearly extends the map \u03bd \u2297 id2 :\nM1 \u2297M2 \u2192 M2, which has norm \u2016\u03bd\u2016, it follows that \u2016\u03bd \u2297M id2\u2016 = \u2016\u03bd\u2016. \u0003\nRemarks. By uniqueness, and the fact that (M2)\u2217 = {\u03c6|M2 : \u03c6 \u2208 B(h)\u2217} where h is\nthe Hilbert space on which M2 acts, it follows that \u03bd \u2297M id2 = \u03bd \u2297M idB(h2)|M. In\nparticular, by Remark 1.4 of [LiW], \u03bd \u2297M id2 is completely bounded with cb-norm\nequal to \u2016\u03bd\u2016cb = \u2016\u03bd\u2016; moreover the map \u03bd \u2297M id2 is completely positive if the\nfunctional \u03bd is positive. In fact, the above result still holds if \u03bd is replaced by a\ncompletely bounded map into another von Neumann algebra M3, with (1.1) now\nreading (id3\u2297\u03d5)(\u03bd \u2297M id2) = \u03bd \u25e6 (id1\u2297\u03d5) ([LiW]).\nIf \u03bd is ultraweakly continuous then \u03bd \u2297M id2 equals \u03bd \u2297 id2. Of course there are\nalso bounded operators id1 M\u2297 \u00b5 : M \u2192 M1, for each \u00b5 \u2208 (M2)\n\u2217, and the validity\nof the commutation relation\n\u03bd1 \u25e6 (id1 M\u2297 \u03bd2) = \u03bd2 \u25e6 (\u03bd1 \u2297M id2) (1.2)\nfor functionals \u03bdi \u2208 (Mi)\n\u2217, i = 1, 2, naturally arises. Under the assumptions that\nM2 is infinite dimensional and the Hilbert space on which M1 acts is separable,\nTomiyama showed that (1.2) holds for all \u03bd2 \u2208 (M2)\n\u2217 if and only if \u03bd1 is ultraweakly\ncontinuous, that is \u03bd1 \u2208 (M1)\u2217 ([Tom], Theorem 5.1). There is a corresponding\nresult for completely bounded maps ([Neu], Theorem 5.4).\n3\n2. Convolution semigroups on C\u2217-bialgebras\nWe first recall the definition.\nDefinition. A (counital) C\u2217-bialgebra is a C\u2217-algebra B equipped with a nonde-\ngenerate \u2217-homomorphism \u2206 : B \u2192M(B\u2297B), called the coproduct, and a character\n\u01eb : B \u2192 C, called the counit, satisfying the coassociativity and counital properties:\n(idB \u2297\u2206)\u2206 = (\u2206\u2297 idB)\u2206 and (idB \u2297 \u01eb)\u2206 = idB = (\u01eb\u2297 idB)\u2206.\nA useful neutral expression for the first two maps is \u2206(2). C\u2217-bialgebras are also\ncalled locally compact quantum semigroups; unital C\u2217-bialgebras are called compact\nquantum semigroups, or C\u2217-bialgebras of compact type.\nFix now, and for the rest of the paper, a C\u2217-bialgebra B. For \u03bb, \u00b5 \u2208 B\u2217, their\nconvolution is defined as the following composition of strict maps:\n\u03bb \u22c6 \u00b5 = (\u03bb \u2297 \u00b5)\u2206.\nConvolution may also be viewed as a product on M(B)\u2217\u03b2 .\nProposition 2.1. Both (B\u2217, \u22c6) and (M(B)\u2217\u03b2 , \u22c6) are unital Banach algebras, with\nrespective identities \u01eb and \u01eb\u02dc, and strict extension defines a unital isometric algebra\nisomorphism from the former to the latter.\nProof. Straightforward. \u0003\nDefinition. A convolution semigroup of functionals on B is a family of functionals\n(\u03bbt)t\u22650 in B\n\u2217 satisfying\n\u03bb0 = \u01eb and \u03bbs+t = \u03bbs \u22c6 \u03bbt, s, t \u2265 0;\nIt is weakly continuous if\nlim\nt\u21920+\n\u03bbt(a) = \u01eb(a), a \u2208 B\nand norm-continuous if\nlim\nt\u21920+\n\u2016\u03bbt \u2212 \u01eb\u2016 = 0.\nRestricting to semigroups of states, Propositions 1.1 and 2.1 imply the following.\nProposition 2.2. Strict extension defines a one-to-one correspondence between\nweakly continuous convolution semigroups of states on B and weakly continuous\nconvolution semigroups of strict states on M(B).\nThe norm-continuous case is summarised in the next result. In brief, norm-\ncontinuous convolution semigroups have bounded generators, from which the semi-\ngroup may be recovered by exponentiation. This also operates at the multiplier\nalgebra level.\nProposition 2.3. Let (\u03bbt)t\u22650 be a norm-continuous convolution semigroup of func-\ntionals on B. Then there is a unique functional \u03b3 \u2208 B\u2217 such that\nlim\nt\u21920+\n\u2225\u22251\nt\n(\u03bbt \u2212 \u01eb)\u2212 \u03b3\n\u2225\u2225 = 0.\nMoreover,\n\u03bbt =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\n1\nn!\n(t\u03b3)\u22c6n, \u03bb\u02dct =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\n1\nn!\n(t\u03b3\u02dc)\u22c6n, t \u2265 0,\n4\nand\nlim\nt\u21920+\n\u2225\u22251\nt\n(\u03bb\u02dct \u2212 \u01eb\u02dc)\u2212 \u03b3\u02dc\n\u2225\u2225 = 0.\nThe functional \u03b3 is called the generating functional of (\u03bbt)t\u22650.\nProof. In view of Proposition 2.1, this follows from elementary properties of norm-\ncontinuous semigroups in a unital Banach algebra. \u0003\nThe class of norm-continuous convolution semigroups of states is analogous to\nthe class of classical convolution semigroups of compound Poisson type, with \u2018initial\nmeasure\u2019 \u03b3 + \u01eb. More justification for this terminology is given in [Fra] and [LS1].\nThe class of functionals \u03b3 \u2208 B\u2217 which generate a convolution semigroup of states\non B is characterised as follows ([LS2]): \u03b3 is *-preserving, conditionally positive in\nthe sense that \u03b3(a) \u2265 0 for a \u2208 B+ \u2229Ker \u01eb and satisfies \u03b3\u02dc(1) = 0. This is a form of\nScho\u00a8nberg correspondence; see [Sch] for its algebraic (i.e. non-analytic) counterpart.\nFor further classical motivations we refer to [Hey].\nTo each functional \u00b5 \u2208 B\u2217 there are associated two completely bounded strict\nmaps B \u2192M(B):\nL\u00b5 = (\u00b5\u2297 idB)\u2206 and R\u00b5 = (idB \u2297 \u00b5)\u2206, (2.1)\nand their strict extensions L\u02dc\u00b5, R\u02dc\u00b5 : M(B) \u2192 M(B). Note that the original func-\ntional may be recovered from either of these maps: \u01eb\u25e6L\u00b5 = \u00b5 = \u01eb\u25e6R\u00b5; from which\nit follows that \u2016L\u00b5\u2016cb = \u2016L\u00b5\u2016 = \u2016\u00b5\u2016 = \u2016R\u00b5\u2016 = \u2016R\u00b5\u2016cb. If the map L\u00b5 is positive\nthen the functional \u00b5 is positive, so L\u00b5 is actually completely positive; also L\u02dc\u00b5 is\nunital if and only if \u00b5\u02dc is. Thus L\u02dc\u00b5 is completely positive and unital if and only\nif \u00b5 is a state. The same goes for the maps R\u00b5 and R\u02dc\u00b5. The strict extensions of\nthe L-map \u00b5 7\u2192 L\u00b5 and R-map \u00b5 7\u2192 R\u00b5 define completely isometric unital algebra\nmorphisms between the Banach algebras (B\u2217, \u22c6) and CB(M(B)), sharing the same\nleft inverse: T\u02dc 7\u2192 \u01eb \u25e6 T , where T := T\u02dc |B.\nFor any convolution semigroup of functionals (\u03bbt)t\u22650 on B, (P\u02dct := R\u02dc\u03bbt)t\u22650 there-\nfore defines a strict semigroup of completely bounded maps onM(B), which we call\nthe associated semigroup on the multiplier algebra. It determines the original con-\nvolution semigroup via the identity:\n\u03bb\u02dct = \u01eb\u02dc \u25e6 P\u02dct, t \u2265 0. (2.2)\nMoreover, the semigroup (P\u02dct)t\u22650 is completely positive and unital if and only if\n(\u03bbt)t\u22650 is a convolution semigroup of states. We stress the point that, in the\nnoncompact case (B nonunital), Pt := R\u03bbt need not leave B invariant and so there\nmay be no semigroup on B itself. In the next section we shall see that, under a\nnatural condition on B, this obstruction is removed.\nThe semigroups on M(B) which are associated with convolution semigroups of\nfunctionals on B are characterised in several simple ways. This is the content of\nthe next result. The convention on composing strict maps permits us to dispense\nwith almost all tildes.\nTheorem 2.4. Let (P\u02dct)t\u22650 be a strict semigroup on M(B) and set Pt := P\u02dct|B :\nB \u2192M(B) (t \u2265 0). Then the following conditions are equivalent:\n(i) (P\u02dct)t\u22650 is associated to a convolution semigroup of functionals on B;\n5\n(ii) (Pt)t\u22650 enjoys the commutativity property:\nL\u00b5Pt = PtL\u00b5, \u00b5 \u2208 B\n\u2217, t \u2265 0;\n(iii) for each t \u2265 0, Pt is completely bounded, idB \u2297 Pt is strict as a map from\nB\u2297 B to M(B\u2297 B), and the following strong invariance condition holds:\n\u2206Pt = (idB \u2297 Pt)\u2206; (2.3)\n(iv) (Pt)t\u22650 satisfies the weak invariance condition:\nPt =\n(\nidB \u2297 (\u01eb \u25e6 Pt)\n)\n\u2206, t \u2265 0. (2.4)\nProof. The implication (iii)\u21d2(ii) is immediate.\n(ii)\u21d2(iv): Assume that (ii) holds and let t \u2265 0. Then, since \u01eb \u25e6 L\u00b5 = \u00b5,\n\u00b5 \u25e6\n(\nidB \u2297 (\u01eb \u25e6 Pt)\n)\n\u2206 = (\u01eb \u25e6 Pt)L\u00b5 = \u01eb \u25e6 (L\u00b5Pt) = \u00b5 \u25e6 Pt, \u00b5 \u2208 B\n\u2217,\nso (iv) holds.\n(iv)\u21d2(i): Assume that (iv) holds and define \u03bbt = \u01eb \u25e6 Pt \u2208 B\n\u2217 (t \u2265 0). Then, for\ns, t \u2265 0,\n(\u03bbs \u2297 \u03bbt)\u2206 = ((\u01eb \u25e6 Ps)\u2297 (\u01eb \u25e6 Pt))\u2206\n=\n(\n\u01eb \u25e6 Ps\n)(\nidB \u2297 (\u01eb \u25e6 Pt)\n)\n\u2206 =\n(\n\u01eb \u25e6 Ps\n)\nPt = \u01eb \u25e6 Ps+t = \u03bbs+t,\nand\nR\u03bbt = (idB \u2297 \u03bbt)\u2206 =\n(\nidB \u2297 (\u01eb \u25e6 Pt)\n)\n\u2206 = Pt.\nThus (\u03bbt)t\u22650 is a convolution semigroup of functionals on B and (P\u02dct)t\u22650 is its\nassociated semigroup on M(B).\n(i)\u21d2(iii): Assume that (P\u02dct)t\u22650 is the semigroup on M(B) associated with a\nconvolution semigroup of functionals (\u03bbt)t\u22650 on B, and let t \u2265 0. Then Pt is\ncompletely bounded, idB\u2297Pt equals the composition (idB\u2297 idB\u2297\u03bbt)(idB\u2297\u2206) and\nso is strict, and (2.3) holds by coassociativity:\n\u2206Pt = \u2206(idB \u2297 \u03bbt)\u2206 = (idB \u2297 idB \u2297 \u03bbt)\u2206\n(2) = (idB \u2297 Pt)\u2206.\n\u0003\nRemarks. The above proof yields the following useful characterisations of the range\nof the R-map:\nRanR = {T \u2208 B(B;M(B)) : T is strict and L\u00b5T = TL\u00b5 for all \u00b5 \u2208 B\n\u2217}\n= {T \u2208 CB(B;M(B)) : (idB \u2297 T ) is strict and \u2206T = (idB \u2297 T )\u2206}\n= {T \u2208 B(B;M(B)) : T = (idB \u2297 (\u01eb \u25e6 T ))\u2206}.\nIn the absence of a counit these equalities are replaced by\nRanR \u2282 {T \u2208 CB(B;M(B)) : (idB \u2297 T ) is strict and L\u00b5T = TL\u00b5 for all \u00b5 \u2208 B\n\u2217}\n= {T \u2208 CB(B;M(B)) : (idB \u2297 T ) is strict and \u2206T = (idB \u2297 T )\u2206}.\nThe equality follows from the fact that the set {(\u00b5 \u2297 idB)\u02dc : \u00b5 \u2208 B\u2217} separates\nM(B \u2297 B), and the inclusion from the fact that (\u00b5 \u2297 idB \u2297 \u03bb)\u2206\n(2) is a common\nexpression for L\u00b5R\u03bb and R\u03bbL\u00b5 (\u03bb, \u00b5 \u2208 B\n\u2217).\n6\nSo far we have not considered the question of continuity, in t, for convolution\nsemigroups and their associated semigroups. It is easily seen that one is norm-\ncontinuous if and only the other is, in which case the generating functional and the\ngenerator of the associated semigroup are related by Z\n\u02dc\n= R\u02dc\u03b3 and \u03b3\u02dc = \u01eb\u02dc \u25e6 Z\n\u02dc\n. The\ncorresponding statement at the level of weak\/strong continuity need not be true.\nFor example the translation semigroup on Cb(R) is the semigroup associated with\nthe convolution semigroup of Dirac measures (\u03b4t)t\u22650 on R. Whereas the latter is\nweakly continuous, the former is not. However the translation semigroup leaves\nC0(R) invariant and restricts to a strongly continuous semigroup there. This is\na Feller property ([Jac]) which, in our framework, corresponds to the semigroup\n(P\u02dct)t\u22650 leaving the C\n\u2217-algebra B invariant and restricting to a C0-semigroup on B.\nIn the next section we shall see that this holds for all weakly continuous semigroups\non a wide class of locally compact quantum semigroups which includes all locally\ncompact (quantum) groups. We warn the reader that there is a variety of definitions\nof \u2018Feller\u2019 and \u2018strong Feller\u2019\u2014in both the classical and noncommutative literature\n(e.g. [Sau]).\n3. Convolution semigroups on C\u2217-bialgebras satisfying\nthe residual vanishing at infinity condition\nThroughout this section we assume that B is a C\u2217-bialgebra which enjoys the\nfollowing \u2018residual vanishing at infinity\u2019 property:\n(B\u2297 1)\u2206(B) \u2282 B\u2297 B and (1\u2297 B)\u2206(B) \u2282 B\u2297 B.\nThe C\u2217-bialgebras arising from locally compact quantum groups in the sense of\nKustermans and Vaes ([KuV]) satisfy this property, as do (trivially) all unital C\u2217-\nbialgebras. In the classical case of a commutative quantum semigroup (see Sec-\ntion 5), B = C0(H) for a locally compact semigroup H , B \u2297 B and M(B \u2297 B) are\nidentified with C0(H \u00d7H) and Cb(H \u00d7H) respectively, and the coproduct is given\nby \u2206(F )(h1, h2) = F (h1h2), for F \u2208 B and h1, h2 \u2208 H . To see how the condi-\ntion applies then, let F, F \u2032 \u2208 C0(H). If |F (h)|, |F\n\u2032(h)| < \u01eb for h \u2208 H \\ K then\n|F (h1)F\n\u2032(h1h2)| < \u01eb\n2 for (h1, h2) \u2208 H\u00d7H \\\u03c6\n\u22121(K\u00d7K) where \u03c6 is the homeomor-\nphism (h1, h2) 7\u2192 (h1, h1h2). It follows that (F \u2297 1)\u2206F\n\u2032 \u2208 C0(H \u00d7H) = B\u2297B and\nsimilarly for (1\u2297F )\u2206F \u2032. Lance credits Iain Raeburn for the suggestive terminology\n(in [Lan]).\nThe maps R\u00b5 and L\u00b5 defined in (2.1) now act on B, as we show next.\nProposition 3.1. Let \u00b5 \u2208 B\u2217. Then\nR\u00b5(B) \u2282 B and L\u00b5(B) \u2282 B.\nProof. This follows from the fact, commonly used in topological quantum group\ntheory, that \u00b5 \u2208 B\u2217 may be factorised as \u03bbc, for some \u03bb \u2208 B\u2217 and c \u2208 B ([Tay]);\nL\u00b5(a) = (\u00b5\u2297 idB)\u02dc(\u2206(a))\n= (\u03bb\u2297 idB)\u02dc((c\u2297 1)\u2206(a)) \u2208 (\u03bb\u2297 idB)(B\u2297 B) \u2282 B, a \u2208 B,\nand similarly for R\u00b5. \u0003\nThe significance of this is that each convolution semigroup of functionals (\u03bbt)t\u22650\non B now has an associated semigroup on the C\u2217-algebra B itself: (Pt := R\u03bbt)t\u22650.\n7\nReconstruction of the convolution semigroup from its associated semigroup now\nreads:\n\u03bbt = \u01eb \u25e6 Pt, t \u2265 0, (3.1)\nand Theorem 2.4 now has the following version.\nProposition 3.2. Let (Pt)t\u22650 be a strict semigroup on B. Then the following\nconditions are equivalent:\n(i) (Pt)t\u22650 is associated to a convolution semigroup of functionals on B;\n(ii) (Pt)t\u22650 enjoys the commutativity property\nL\u00b5Pt = PtL\u00b5, \u00b5 \u2208 B\n\u2217, t \u2265 0;\n(iii) for each t \u2265 0, Pt is completely bounded, idB\u2297Pt is strict and the following\nstrong invariance condition holds:\n\u2206Pt = (idB \u2297 Pt)\u2206.\n(iv) (Pt)t\u22650 satisfies the weak invariance condition:\nPt = (idB \u2297 (\u01eb \u25e6 Pt))\u2206, t \u2265 0;\nMoreover we now have a satisfactory correspondence between continuity proper-\nties of the respective semigroups, showing that the semigroup on M(B) associated\nwith any weakly continuous convolution semigroup of functionals on B is necessarily\nFeller.\nTheorem 3.3. Let (Pt)t\u22650 be the semigroup on B associated with a convolution\nsemigroup of functionals (\u03bbt)t\u22650 on B. Then the following are equivalent:\n(i) (\u03bbt)t\u22650 is weakly continuous;\n(ii) (Pt)t\u22650 is a C0-semigroup.\nProof. This follows from the identities\n(\u03bbt \u2212 \u01eb) = \u01eb \u25e6 (Pt \u2212 idB) and \u00b5 \u25e6 (Pt \u2212 idB) = (\u03bbt \u2212 \u01eb) \u25e6 L\u00b5,\nfor t \u2265 0 and \u00b5 \u2208 B\u2217. \u0003\nUnder the weak continuity assumption, Proposition 3.2 can be formulated at the\nlevel of generators.\nProposition 3.4. Let (Pt)t\u22650 be a C0-semigroup on B with generator Z. Then the\nfollowing are equivalent:\n(i) (Pt)t\u22650 is the semigroup associated with a weakly continuous convolution\nsemigroup of functionals;\n(ii) Z enjoys the commutativity property:\nL\u00b5Z \u2282 ZL\u00b5, \u00b5 \u2208 B\n\u2217,\nthat is, L\u00b5(DomZ) \u2282 DomZ and L\u00b5Z(a) = ZL\u00b5(a) for all a \u2208 DomZ.\nProof. This follows from Theorem 3.3, the equivalence (i)\u21d4(ii) of Proposition 3.2,\nand Theorem 1.15 of [Dav]. \u0003\n8\nDefinition. For a weakly continuous convolution semigroup of functionals (\u03bbt)t\u22650\non B, the functional \u03b3 : Dom\u03b3 \u2282 B \u2192 C defined by\nDom \u03b3 :=\n{\na \u2208 B : lim\nt\u21920+\n\u03bbt(a)\u2212 \u01eb(a)\nt\nexists\n}\n;\n\u03b3(d) := lim\nt\u21920+\n\u03bbt(d)\u2212 \u01eb(d)\nt\n, d \u2208 Dom \u03b3,\nis called the generating functional of (\u03bbt)t\u22650.\nRemarks. If (\u03bbt)t\u22650 is norm-continuous then the functional \u03b3 defined above is equal\nto that of Proposition 2.3, so our terminology is consistent. If each \u03bbt is *-preserving\nthen Dom \u03b3 is selfadjoint and \u03b3 is *-preserving. If each \u03bbt is a state, then \u03b3 is\nconditionally positive, in the sense that \u03b3(a) \u2265 0 for all a \u2208 B+ \u2229 Dom \u03b3 \u2229 Ker \u01eb\n(again, consistently with the earlier definition). The identity (3.1) implies the\ninclusion \u01eb \u25e6Z \u2282 \u03b3, where Z is the generator of the associated C0-semigroup on B,\nso Dom\u03b3 is norm-dense in B.\nNote that \u03b3 can be defined for a weakly continous convolution semigroup on any\nC\u2217-bialgebra, however, without the residual vanishing at infinity property, there is\nno guarantee that \u03b3 be densely defined.\nWe now recall a useful construction from semigroup theory.

By the Uniform Boundedness Principle, it follows that,\nfor all x \u2208 DomZ\u0302, there is a unique element l \u2208 X\u2217\u2217 satisfying\nlim\nt\u21920+\n\u00b5(Pt(x)) \u2212 \u00b5(x)\nt\n= l(\u00b5), \u00b5 \u2208 X\u2217.\nSetting Z\u0302(x) := l, we have an operator Z\u0302 : X \u2192 X\u2217\u2217 with dense domain DomZ\u0302\n(justifying the notation (3.2)). Under the canonical identification of X as a sub-\nspace of X\u2217\u2217, clearly Z\u0302 \u2283 Z. The precise situation is summarised next. This is\na rewording of Theorem 1.24 of [Dav], where the reader is warned of a missing\nhypothesis (not needed here), namely that\u2014in the notation used there\u2014L must\nalso be assumed to be invariant under each T \u2217t .\nLemma 3.5. Let (Pt)t\u22650 be a C0-semigroup on a Banach space X with generator\nZ, and associated operator Z\u0302 : DomZ\u0302 \u2282 X \u2192 X\u2217\u2217. Then\nDomZ = {x \u2208 DomZ\u0302 : Z\u0302(x) \u2208 X} and Z = Z\u0302|DomZ . (3.3)\nIn particular, the operator Z\u0302 uniquely determines the semigroup (Pt)t\u22650.\nThe significance of the operator Z\u0302 for present considerations is indicated by the\nfollowing result.\nProposition 3.6. Let (Pt)t\u22650 be the semigroup on B associated with a weakly\ncontinuous convolution semigroup of functionals (\u03bbt)t\u22650 on B. Then its associated\noperator Z\u0302 : DomZ\u0302 \u2282 B \u2192 B\u2217\u2217 is given by\nDomZ\u0302 = {a \u2208 B : \u2200\u00b5\u2208B\u2217 L\u00b5(a) \u2208 Dom \u03b3}; and (3.4)\nZ\u0302(a)(\u00b5) = \u03b3(L\u00b5(a)), a \u2208 DomZ\u0302, \u00b5 \u2208 B\n\u2217, (3.5)\n9\nwhere \u03b3 is the generating functional of (\u03bbt)t\u22650.\nProof. If \u00b5 \u2208 B\u2217, a \u2208 B and t \u2265 0 then \u00b5(Pt(a)) = \u03bbt(L\u00b5(a)); in particular \u00b5(a) =\n\u01eb(L\u00b5(a)). The identities (3.4) and (3.5) now follow directly from the definitions of\n\u03b3 and Z\u0302. \u0003\nThe next result, the first part of which fully justifies the term \u2018generating func-\ntional\u2019, now follows easily from Proposition 3.6, Lemma 3.5 and the identity (3.1).\nTheorem 3.7. Let (\u03bbt)t\u22650 be a weakly continuous convolution semigroup of func-\ntionals on B with generating functional \u03b3. Then\n(a) the functional \u03b3 determines the semigroup (\u03bbt)t\u22650 uniquely;\n(b) \u03b3 is bounded if and only if (\u03bbt)t\u22650 is norm-continuous, in which case \u03b3 is\neverywhere defined.\n4. Convolution semigroups on C\u2217-bialgebras of discrete type\nFor this section we assume that B is of discrete type, that is, as a C\u2217-algebra, B\nis a c0-direct sum of matrix algebras. The existence of a counit forces B to have\nthe form\nB = C\u2126\u2295 B0 where B0 =\n\u2295\n\u03bb\u2208\u039b\nMn(\u03bb), (4.1)\nfor an index set \u039b and family (n(\u03bb))\u03bb\u2208\u039b in N; the counit being given by the formula\n\u01eb\n(\n\u03b1\u2126\u2295\n\u2295\n\u03bb\u2208\u039b\na\u03bb\n)\n= \u03b1.\nWe identify B0 with 0 \u2295 B0 \u2282 B and view B as represented on the Hilbert space\nC\u2295\n\u2295\n\u03bb\u2208\u039b C\nn(\u03bb). Then M(B) equals the l\u221e-direct sum\nM := C\u2126\u2295\n\u220f\n\u03bb\u2208\u039b\nMn(\u03bb),\nwhich is a von Neumann algebra, coinciding with the universal enveloping von\nNeumann algebra of B.\nThe examples we have in mind are the algebras of functions vanishing at infinity\non a discrete semigroup, and the duals of compact (quantum) groups. In the former\ncase n(\u03bb) = 1 for each \u03bb \u2208 \u039b; in the latter case \u039b is the set of equivalence classes of\nirreducible representations of the underlying compact group; more on these in the\nnext section.\nLemma 4.1. Let (\u03bbt)\u22650 be a weakly continuous convolution semigroup of states\non B. Then its associated semigroup (P\u02dct)t\u22650 on M(B) is strongly continuous.\nProof. SinceM(B) is the von Neumann algebra M, and by the same tokenM(B\u2297B)\nis the von Neumann algebra M\u2297M, Proposition 1.2 gives maps\nL\u03bd := (\u03bd \u2297M idM)\u2206\u02dc :M(B)\u2192M(B), \u03bd \u2208M(B)\n\u2217 = M\u2217,\nsatisfying\n\u03bb\u02dc \u25e6 L\u03bd = \u03bd \u25e6 (idM\u2297 \u03bb\u02dc)\u2206\u02dc = \u03bd \u25e6 R\u02dc\u03bb, \u03bb \u2208 B\n\u2217 = M\u2217, \u03bd \u2208M(B)\n\u2217 = M\u2217.\nIn particular,\n\u03bd \u25e6\n(\nP\u02dct \u2212 idM(B)\n)\n=\n(\n\u03bb\u02dct \u2212 \u01eb\u02dc\n)\n\u25e6 L\u03bd , t \u2265 0, \u03bd \u2208M(B)\n\u2217. (4.2)\n10\nTherefore, by Proposition 2.2, (P\u02dct)t\u22650 is weakly continuous, and so also strongly\ncontinuous. \u0003\nRemark. Note how the existence of slice maps for not-necessarily-strict functionals\nis crucially used in the above proof (via Proposition 1.2).\nTheorem 4.2. Let (\u03bbt)t\u22650 be a weakly continuous convolution semigroup of states\non B. Then (\u03bbt)t\u22650 is norm-continuous.\nProof. Define a functional \u03b3\n\u02dc\n: Dom \u03b3\n\u02dc\n\u2282M(B)\u2192 C by\nDom\u03b3\n\u02dc\n:=\n{\nm \u2208M(B) : lim\nt\u21920+\n\u03bb\u02dct(m)\u2212 \u01eb\u02dc(m)\nt\nexists\n}\n;\n\u03b3\n\u02dc\n(d) = lim\nt\u21920+\n\u03bb\u02dct(d)\u2212 \u01eb\u02dc(d)\nt\n, d \u2208 Dom \u03b3\n\u02dc\n.\nClearly Dom\u03b3\n\u02dc\nis a selfadjoint subspace of M(B) containing 1 and \u03b3\n\u02dc\n(1) = 0.\nMoreover, the identity (2.2) and Lemma 4.1 imply that Dom \u03b3\n\u02dc\nis norm-dense in\nM(B) (cf. the remarks in Section 3).\nLet p be the orthogonal projection 1 \u2212 \u2126 \u2208 M(B). Note that p is the identity\nof the ideal Ker \u01eb\u02dc = M(B0) of M(B). By density and selfadjointness of Dom \u03b3\n\u02dc\nthere exists z \u2208 Dom \u03b3\n\u02dc\nsuch that z = z\u2217 and \u2016p \u2212 z\u2016 \u2264 14 . Note that |\u01eb\u02dc(z)| =\n|\u01eb\u02dc(z \u2212 p)| \u2264 14 . Put y = z \u2212 \u01eb(z)1. Then y \u2208 Dom \u03b3\u02dc\nand \u01eb\u02dc(y) = 0, so in particular\nsupt>0\n\u03bb\u02dct(y)\nt <\u221e. Moreover, since y \u2208M(B0) and z \u2265 p\u2212\n1\n41,\ny = pyp = (pzp\u2212 \u01eb\u02dc(z)p) \u2265 p\n(\np\u2212\n1\n4\n1\n)\np\u2212\n1\n4\np =\n1\n2\np.\nTherefore\nC := sup\nt>0\n\u03bb\u02dct(p)\nt\n\u2264 2 sup\nt>0\n\u03bb\u02dct(y)\nt\n<\u221e.\nNow, for each t > 0, define a positive functional \u00b5t in M(B)\n\u2217\n\u03b2 by the formula\n\u00b5t(m) =\n1\nt\n\u03bb\u02dct(pmp), m \u2208M(B).\nAll these functionals have norm smaller than C:\n\u2016\u00b5t\u2016 = \u00b5t(1) =\n1\nt\n\u03bb\u02dct(p) \u2264 C.\nNow let \u03bd be an arbitrary functional inM(B)\u2217. Then, since p is the identity element\nof M(B0), it follows from (4.2) that, for all m \u2208M(B),\n\u03bd\n(\nP\u02dct(m)\u2212m\n)\n= \u03bb\u02dct\n(\nL\u03bd(m)\u2212 \u01eb\u02dc(L\u03bd(m))1\n)\n= \u03bb\u02dct\n(\np\n(\nL\u03bd(m)\u2212 \u01eb\u02dc(L\u03bd(m))1\n)\np\n)\n= t\u00b5t\n(\nL\u03bd(m)\u2212 \u01eb\u02dc(L\u03bd(m))1\n)\n.\nThus, letting Z\n\u02dc\nbe the generator of the C0-semigroup (P\u02dct)t\u22650,\n|\u03bd(Z\n\u02dc\n(m))| = lim\nt\u21920+\n1\nt\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03bd(P\u02dct(m)\u2212m)\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u2264 2C\u2016L\u03bd(m)\u2016 \u2264 2C\u2016\u03bd\u2016\u2016m\u2016, m \u2208 DomZ\n\u02dc\n.\n11\nIt follows that Z\n\u02dc\nis bounded, so (P\u02dct)t\u22650 is norm-continuous, and therefore (\u03bbt)t\u22650\nis too. \u0003\nRemark. Since the multiplier algebraM(B) is a von Neumann algebra, Theorem 4.2\ncan alternatively be deduced from Lemma 4.1 using the fact that any strongly con-\ntinuous completely positive semigroup on a von Neumann algebra is automatically\nnorm-continuous ([Ell]).\nWe note here that the results of Sections 2, 3 and 4 remain valid for a C\u2217-\nhyperbialgebra B, where the coproduct is only assumed to be completely positive,\nstrict and preunital. Examples of C\u2217-hyperbialgebras are provided by compact\nquantum hypergroups ([ChV]). The classical theory is described in [BlH].\n5. Commutative and cocommutative cases\nLet B be a commutative C\u2217-bialgebra of discrete type. Then it follows from\nGelfand theory that B is of the form C0(\u0393), where \u0393 is a discrete semigroup, and\nthe coproduct and counit are given by\n\u2206(F )(\u03b3, \u03b3\u2032) = f(\u03b3\u03b3\u2032) and \u01eb(F ) = F (e), F \u2208 C0(\u0393), \u03b3, \u03b3\n\u2032 \u2208 \u0393,\nunder the natural identificationsM(B\u2297B) =M(C0(\u0393\u00d7\u0393)) = Cb(\u0393\u00d7\u0393), moreover\nthe residual vanishing at infinity property holds, as mentioned earlier. In this case\nconvolution semigroups of states on B correspond to convolution semigroups of\nprobability measures on \u0393 via the Riesz Representation Theorem, and Theorem 4.2\nspecialises as follows.\nProposition 5.1. Every convolution semigroup of probability measures on a dis-\ncrete semigroup has bounded infinitesimal generator.\nThis extends the central conclusion of Theorem 4.1.5 of [Hey], which is formulated\nfor discrete groups.\nRecall that cocommutativity for a C\u2217-bialgebra B means \u03a3\u2206 = \u2206 where \u03a3\ndenotes the tensor flip on B \u2297 B (which is strict as a map B \u2297 B \u2192 M(B \u2297 B));\nit is equivalent to commutativity of the convolution product on B\u2217. For a locally\ncompact group G, the reduced and universal group C\u2217-algebras are isomorphic,\nvia the left regular representation, if and only if G is amenable ([Ped], Theorem\n7.3.9), in particular this holds if G is compact. Therefore, by the Peter-Weyl theory\nof unitary representations of compact groups, the group C\u2217-algebra of a compact\ngroup is isomorphic to a c0-direct sum of matrix algebras.\nWe are not aware of any characterisation of cocommutative C\u2217-bialgebras of\ndiscrete type. However every cocommutative discrete quantum group B is the group\nC\u2217-algebra of a compact group G where, viewing C\u2217(G) as the C\u2217-subalgebra of\nB(L2(G,Haar)) generated by the set of convolution operators \u03bb(F ) : \u03be 7\u2192 F \u22c6 \u03be\n(F \u2208 C(G)), the coproduct and counit are determined by\n\u2206\u02dc(\u03bbg) = \u03bbg \u2297 \u03bbg and \u01eb\u02dc(\u03bbg) = 1, g \u2208 G,\n\u03bbg \u2208 M(B) being the translation operator (\u03bbg\u03be)(g\n\u2032) = \u03be(g\u22121g\u2032). This follows from\nduality theory for locally compact quantum groups ([BaS], [Ku2]). Specifically,\ndiscrete quantum groups are naturally isomorphic to their quantum group biduals;\nthe dual of a cocommutative discrete quantum group is a commutative compact\nquantum group; and the dual of a commutative quantum group C(G) is the group\nC\u2217-algebra of G with the quantum group structure defined above.\n12\nIt is easily verified that the unital *-algebra spanned by {\u03bbg : g \u2208 G} is strictly\ndense in the multiplier algebra M(B), and that the map g 7\u2192 \u03bbg is strictly contin-\nuous G\u2192M(B). The following consequence of Proposition 7.1.9 of [Ped], is noted\nhere for convenience.\nProposition 5.2. Let B be the group C\u2217-algebra of a compact group G. Then\n\u03c9\u02dc(\u03bbg) = \u03c6(g), g \u2208 G, (5.1)\ndescribes a one-to-one correspondence between the positive linear functionals \u03c9 on\nB and the continuous positive-definite functions \u03c6 on G.\nGiven a positive-definite function \u03c6 on a group G, the function \u03c8 : G \u2192 C,\ng 7\u2192 \u03c6(g) \u2212 \u03c6(e) plainly enjoys the following three properties: it is conditionally\npositive definite, that is, for all n \u2208 N, g1, . . . , gn \u2208 G and z1, . . . , zn \u2208 C satisfying\u2211n\ni=1 zi = 0,\nn\u2211\ni,j=1\nzizj\u03c8(g\n\u22121\ni gj) \u2265 0,\nit is Hermitian, i.e.\n\u03c8 = \u03c8\u2217 where \u03c8\u2217(g) := \u03c8(g\u22121), g \u2208 G,\nand it vanishes at the identity element e:\n\u03c8(e) = 0.\nThe content of the theorem below is that the converse holds if G is compact and \u03c8\nis continuous. We deduce this from our results.\nTheorem 5.3 ([Gui], Theorem 4.1). Let G be a compact group and let \u03c8 \u2208 C(G)\nbe Hermitian, conditionally positive-definite and vanish at the identity element e.\nThen there is a positive-definite function \u03c6 on G such that\n\u03c8(g) = \u03c6(g)\u2212 \u03c6(e), g \u2208 G, (5.2)\nin other words there is a constant C \u2208 R+ such that (\u03c8 + C) is positive-definite.\nProof. Let B be the discrete quantum group C\u2217(G), as above, and let B be the\n*-algebraic span of {\u03bbg : g \u2208 G} in M(B). By the Scho\u00a8nberg correspondence, the\ncontinuous function et\u03c8 is positive-definite for each t \u2265 0 ([PaS], Lemma 1.7). Let\n(\u00b5t)t\u22650 be the corresponding family of states on B, defined via (5.1). Then, for all\ng \u2208 G and s, t \u2208 R+,\n(\u00b5\u02dcs \u22c6 \u00b5\u02dct)(\u03bbg) = \u00b5\u02dcs(\u03bbg)\u00b5\u02dct(\u03bbg) = e\ns\u03c8(g)et\u03c8(g) = e(s+t)\u03c8(g) = \u00b5\u02dcs+t(\u03bbg)\nand\n\u00b5\u02dc0(\u03bbg) = 1 = \u01eb\u02dc(\u03bbg).\nBy the strict density of B inM(B), it follows that (\u00b5t)t\u22650 is a convolution semigroup\nof states on B. In view of the identity\n\u00b5t(\u03bb(F )) =\n\u222b\nG\nF (g)et\u03c8(g)d g, t \u2208 R+, F \u2208 C(G),\n13\nit follows from the compactness of G and Lebesgue\u2019s Dominated Convergence The-\norem, that (\u00b5t)t\u22650 is weakly continuous. Therefore, by Theorem 4.2, it is norm-\ncontinuous and so, by Proposition 2.3, the strict extension of its generating func-\ntional \u03b3 satisfies\n\u03b3\u02dc(\u03bbg) = lim\nt\u21920+\nt\u22121\n(\n\u00b5\u02dct(\u03bbg)\u2212 \u01eb\u02dc(\u03bbg)\n)\n= lim\nt\u21920+\nt\u22121\n(\net\u03c8(g) \u2212 1\n)\n= \u03c8(g), g \u2208 G.\nBy Theorem 6.3 of [LS2], there is a nondegenerate representation (\u03c0, h) of B and\nvector \u03b7 \u2208 h such that \u03b3 = \u03c9\u03b7 \u25e6 (\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b9 \u25e6 \u01eb) where \u03b9 is the ampliation C \u2192 B(h) and\n\u03c9\u03b7 denotes the vector functional T 7\u2192 \u3008\u03b7, T \u03b7\u3009 on B(h). Letting \u03c6 : G \u2192 C be the\npositive-definite function g 7\u2192 (\u03c9\u03b7 \u25e6 \u03c0\u02dc)(\u03bbg), we have \u03c6(g)\u2212\u03c6(e) = \u03b3\u02dc(\u03bbg) = \u03c8(g) for\nall g \u2208 G, and so the proof is complete. \u0003\nRemarks. Guichardet\u2019s approach is to reduce the proposition to the vanishing of\nthe first cohomology group of unitary representations of compact groups and then\nto appeal to Theorem 15.1 of [PaS], which delivers just that.\nConversely, for the special case of multiplier C\u2217-bialgebras of the form C\u2217(G)\nwhere G is a compact group, Theorem 5.3 can be used to give an alternative proof\nof Theorem 6.3 of [LS2]\nAcknowledgement.
