Introduction\nThe aim of this paper is to develop a theory for the long-wave instability of short-\ncrested Stokes waves (SCWs). These waves are one of the simplest classes of doubly\nperiodic three-dimensional water waves and are therefore of fundamental interest,\nand they are of practical importance since they appear in models for coastal sand\ntransport, re\ufb02ection o\ufb00 vertical seawalls, and wave propagation along channels.\nHistorically, the problem of stability of SCWs has been approached directly. Roskes\n(1976b) proposed the use of coupled nonlinear Stokes (NLS) equations to model SCW\ninstability, Mollo-Christensen (1981) proposed the use of Whitham modulation theory,\nIoualalen & Kharif (1994) computed eigenvalues of the exact linear stability problem\nnumerically, and Badulin et al. (1995) presented a qualitative analysis based on the\nZakharov (1968) Hamiltonian formulation for water waves. As far as we are aware\nthese are the only papers in the literature on a theoretical approach to the linear\nstability of SCWs.\nHowever, Roberts (1983) points out that SCWs are a special case of two-phase\nwavetrains, and he proposes that the theory of Ablowitz & Benney (1970), where\nmodulation equations for multi-phase wavetrains are derived, be used for the stability\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 12 Jun 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.139\n148 T.

It is possible that this approach would work, but the Ablowitz\u2013Benney\nequation is non-local and not easy to work with. However, embedding the SCWs in\na two-phase wavetrain turns out to be the correct approach.\nThe basic observation is that an understanding of the linear stability of SCWs \u2013 even\nweakly nonlinear SCWs \u2013 is closely associated with understanding the stability of the\noblique non-resonant interaction between two waves. One way to see the connection\nbetween SCWs and two-wave interaction is to note that when an SCW becomes\nunstable to long-wave perturbations, the resonant SCW plus the perturbation is a\nwave with a wavenumber vector which is no longer resonant.\nThis observation is a generalization to two space dimensions of the geometry of\nsideband instability. A weakly nonlinear Stokes wave is stable to perturbations of the\nsame wavelength. However, if a perturbation of a slightly longer wavelength is added,\nit is unstable. This instability is determined by the susceptibility of the Stokes wave to\nwaves with slightly longer wavelength. In the case of SCWs there are two sidebands:\nsidebands in wavenumber space associated with both the x and y directions. Therefore\nthe perturbed wavenumber vector is perturbed in both length and direction.\nIn the theory proposed here, the SCW is \ufb01rst embedded in a six-parameter family\nof multi-phase wavetrains, as shown schematically in \ufb01gure 1, and then a posteriori\nthe limit to resonant SCWs is taken, accumulating along the way enough information\nto predict all the long-wave instabilities of SCWs. E\ufb00ectively, the embedding provides\ninformation about the susceptibility of the SCW to distortion in wavenumber space\nby the perturbation.\nA by-product of this analysis is a stability theory for the general two-phase wave-\ntrain, which may be of independent interest. For example Onorato et al. (2003) show\nthat the instability of the non-resonant two-wave interaction may explain the double-\npeaked power spectrum of waves in shallow water observed by Smith & Vincent\n(1992).\nThe existence of the SCWs is assumed throughout, and attention is restricted to\ngravity waves on a \ufb02uid of in\ufb01nite depth, although the implications for other classes\nof waves will be apparent. There is now a range of analytical and numerical existence\nresults in the literature that we can appeal to (e.g. Hsu, Silvester & Tsuchiya 1980;\nRoberts 1983; Roberts & Peregrine 1983; Ioualalen 1993; Kimmoun, Branger &\nKharif 1999; Craig & Nicholls 2000, 2002 and references therein). A rigorous theory\nfor the existence of gravity SCWs has been elusive and Craig & Nicholls (2002) point\nout that there are technical problems associated with small divisors. However, in the\ncase of capillary\u2013gravity SCWs there is a well-developed existence theory (Craig &\nNicholls 2000).\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 12 Jun 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.139\nInstability of short-crested Stokes waves 149\nIn addition to the existence of SCWs, the theory also uses an embedding of SCWs\nin a general non-resonant two-phase wavetrain. Historically, the analyses of two-\nwave and n-wave interactions have been considered independently of SCWs. The\nonly results in the literature for the general two-wave interaction are for the weakly\nnonlinear case (e.g. Longuet-Higgins 1962; Willebrand 1975; Weber & Barrick 1977;\nPierson 1993; Elfouhaily et al. 2000 and references therein). It is easy to show that\napplying the SCW limit to the (weakly nonlinear) two-wave interaction results in the\nusual (weakly nonlinear) SCW solutions. However, a key new feature of the theory\nhere is that information is extracted from the embedding, before the limit to SCWs is\ntaken.\nIn this paper, a theory for the stability of weakly nonlinear SCWs and \ufb01nite-\namplitude SCWs is developed. The only restriction is on the perturbation wave-\nnumbers, which are restricted to long-wave perturbations. These perturbations are\ngeneralizations of the Benjamin\u2013Feir instability of plane travelling waves.\nA Stokes-type expansion for SCWs is singular in the long-crested limit (see\nRoberts & Peregrine 1983, where an alternative theory is proposed which avoids\nthe singularity). Since this paper is primarily concerned with periodic SCWs, it is\nassumed throughout that the parameter values for the SCWs are chosen away from\nthe long-crested limit. Since the waves under consideration in this paper are in in\ufb01nite\ndepth, mean \ufb02ow will be ignored. It is important to note that neglect of mean \ufb02ow is\nan assumption. It is certainly true for weakly nonlinear SCWs in in\ufb01nite depth, but it\nis an open question whether wave-generated mean \ufb02ow can occur for \ufb01nite-amplitude\nSCWs. The formulation presented here is amenable to including mean \ufb02ow e\ufb00ects\n(see discussion in \u00a7 10). However, it is assumed in this paper that the SCWs are not\naccompanied by wave-generated mean \ufb02ow.\nThe water-wave problem is Hamiltonian, and it will be advantageous to recognize\nthis in the development of the theory. The Hamiltonian approach was \ufb01rst applied by\nBadulin et al. (1995) to the analysis of SCWs and it was shown to have advantages.\nThis idea is taken a step further here with the use of the multi-symplectic formulation\nof Hamiltonian PDEs. Since water waves and other Hamiltonian PDEs for SCWs\ncan be reformulated as multi-symplectic systems, a general formulation of multi-\nsymplectic Hamiltonian PDEs can be taken as the starting point\nMZt + KZx + LZy = \u2207S(Z), Z \u2208\u0001, (1.1)\nwhere M, K and L are constant skew-symmetric operators, \u0001 is a linear space (either\n\u0002n for the nonlinear wave equation or an inner-product space of functions on the\ncross-section for water waves), and the gradient of S is with respect to the inner\nproduct on \u0001. Details of this formulation for water waves and other Hamiltonian\nPDEs can be found in Bridges (1996, 1997a, b) and the details needed here are\nrecorded in \u00a7 2, including a new multi-symplectic formulation of the nonlinear wave\nequation in two space dimensions. This nonlinear wave equation provides a simple\nmodel problem for SCWs and an example where the long-wave transverse instability\nof SCWs can disappear at low amplitude.\nThe advantage of the multi-symplectic framework is \ufb01ve-fold: (a) it is clear and\nunambiguous how to formulate the long-wave stability theory, using only the structure\nof the equations; (b) embedding the stability problem in the two-wave interaction is a\nnatural part of the multi-symplectic approach and provides further information about\nthe nature of the instability; (c) explicit results for weakly nonlinear water waves can\nbe obtained; (d ) general conclusions about SCW instability for other systems are also\ndeduced; (e) it is straightforward to include mean\ufb02ow e\ufb00ects.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 12 Jun 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.139\n150 T. J. Bridges and F. E. Laine-Pearson\nWhat is a SCW? The de\ufb01nition is implicit in the literature, and in Appendix A an\nexplicit de\ufb01nition of SCWs is given. A solution, say Z(x, y, t) of (1.1), is called an SCW\nif it is periodic in x, y and t , travelling in the x-direction (a function of x and t in linear\ncombination only), and is invariant under reversibility in the y-direction. A de\ufb01nition\nof y-reversibility with examples is given in \u00a7 2. An immediate and illuminating\nconsequence of this de\ufb01nition is that SCWs have zero transverse momentum \u2013\nbut certainly have non-zero longitudinal momentum. This property of SCWs is useful\nfor interpreting the embedding of SCWs in a two-phase wavetrain: the embedding\ndeforms the SCWs into waves with non-zero transverse momentum, thereby testing\nthe susceptibility of SCWs to perturbation of the transverse momentum.\nMuch of the paper is devoted to the existence, properties and stability of the oblique\ntwo-wave interaction. Let \u03b7(x, y, t) represent the free-surface elevation. The oblique\ntwo-wave interaction of water waves is a solution of the form\n\u03b7(x, y, t) = \u03b7\u0302(\u03b81, \u03b82), (1.2)\nwhere\n\u03b8j = kjx + \u0003jy + \u03c9j t + \u03b8\n0\nj (j = 1, 2), (1.3)\nand (kj , \u0003j ) are the wavenumbers, \u03c9j are the frequencies, \u03b8\n0\nj are phases, and \u03b7\u0302 is a 2\u03c0\nperiodic function of \u03b81 and \u03b82. A short-crested wave is the special case: k2 = k1 = k,\n\u00032 =\u2212\u00031 =\u2212\u0003 and \u03c92 =\u03c91 =\u2212\u03c9, and it is reversible in the y-direction (invariant under\nchange of sign of y; precise de\ufb01nition given in \u00a7 3 and Appendix A). In the linear\nand weakly nonlinear limit this latter condition reduces to the familiar requirement\nof equal amplitudes of the two component waves.\nThe strategy is to construct variational principles for the general two-wave interac-\ntion. The variational principles provide natural Jacobians which contain information\nabout the susceptibility of the SCW to distortion into oblique non-resonant two-wave\ninteraction.\nThe linear stability problem for the general two-wave interaction is then formulated\nand a stability condition derived. Long-wave perturbations are of the form\n\u03b7(x, y, t) = \u03b7\u0302(\u03b81, \u03b82) + Re\n(N(\u03b81, \u03b82)ei(\u03b1x+\u03b2y+\u2126t)) with |\u03b1|, |\u03b2| \u0003 1.\nThe basic state is unstable when Im(\u2126)< 0. This condition can be strengthened to\nIm(\u2126) \u0004=0 by noting that the Hamiltonian symmetry assures us that there exists an\neigenvalue with Im(\u2126)< 0 whenever one exists with Im(\u2126)> 0.\nThe main result is that all long-wave instabilities (of SCWs or the two-wave\ninteraction) are predicted by the zeros of the quartic polynomial\n\b(\u2126,\u03b1, \u03b2) = det[N2\u2126\n2 + N1\u2126 + N0] (1.4)\nwhere Nj are 2\u00d72 matrices dependent on \u03b1, \u03b2 and the basic state. Precise expressions\nfor these matrices are given in \u00a7 5. Taking the limit to SCWs in the matrices Nj leads\nto a linear stability quartic for SCWs. Details of the results for SCWs are given in\n\u00a7 \u00a7 6 and 7.\nThe general result (i.e. not just for water waves) for the weakly nonlinear case can\nbe summarized as follows. Let D(\u03c9, k, \u0003) be the dispersion relation for the linear\nproblem, and suppose parameter values are chosen so that\nD\u03c9 \u0004= 0, Dk \u0004= 0, D\u0003 \u0004= 0.\nConsider a weakly nonlinear solution of (1.1) of the form\nZ(x, y, t) = Z\u0302(x, y, t) = A1 \u03be e\ni(kx+\u0003y\u2212\u03c9t) + A2 \u03be ei(kx\u2212\u0003y\u2212\u03c9t) + c.c. + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (1.5)\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 12 Jun 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.139\nInstability of short-crested Stokes waves 151\nwhere \u03be is an eigenvector determined by the linearized operator, A1 and A2 are\ncomplex amplitudes and the higher-order terms are higher order in |A1| and |A2|.

There are lines in perturbation wavenumber space, and particular values of the\nwavenumber vector of the SCWs, where these coe\ufb03cients vanish. Equation (1.19)\nshows an example of these resonance lines, and further discussion is given in \u00a7 7.\nWhen one of these coe\ufb03cients vanishes, the weakly nonlinear stability properties are\ndetermined at the next order in |A|.\nThe stability exponents are \u03bb= \u00b1 i\u2126 with \u2126 given by (1.10) or (1.12). When |A|=0\nand \u03b2 \u0004=0 there is a double resonance, as shown schematically in \ufb01gure 2(b), plotted\nin the complex \u03bb-plane. The precise position of the resonances depends on the values\nof (k, \u0003) and (\u03b1, \u03b2). For \u03b2 =0, both pairs coalesce and the resonance is fourfold. When\n|A| > 0 the resonances split, and may become unstable. The most dramatic situation\nwhere \u03b2 \u0004= 0 and two modes become unstable is shown in \ufb01gure 2(b).\nThe information contained in (1.10) and (1.12) can be summarized as follows. Let\nD(\u03c9, k, \u0003) be the dispersion relation of the linearized problem and let (\u03c9, k, \u0003) be\nthe frequency and wavenumbers of the weakly nonlinear SCW (or to leading order\nthe values for the linearized problem). Then there are two alternatives for instability\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 12 Jun 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.139\nInstability of short-crested Stokes waves 153\nwhen \u03b2 \u0004= 0.

Secondly, if the determinant (1.14) is negative\nbut\n\u03c9kk \u03c9\nTW\n2 < 0, (1.15)\nthe basic SCW is unstable, where \u03c9TW2 is the frequency correction in (1.7), and \u03c9kk is\nthe second derivative of \u03c9 associated with the x-direction only.\nLongitudinal instabilities (\u03b2 =0) are determined by the signs of \u00b52\u00b1 in (1.13). The\n\ufb01rst condition,\n\u03c9kk\u03c9\nSCW\n2 < 0,\nis similar to the condition proposed by Molloo-Christensen (1981), although \u03c9kk here\ndepends on \u0003 whereas in Mollo-Christensen (1981) the \u0003-dependence is neglected (see\ndiscussion below). The second condition is\n\u03c9kk\n(\n2\u03c9TW2 \u2212 \u03c9SCW2\n)\n< 0.\nThis condition is related to the condition proposed by Roskes (1976b). Clearly a\nsu\ufb03cient condition for longitudinal instability is \u00b52+\u00b5\n2\u2212 < 0 which results in\n0 > \u00b52+\u00b5\n2\n\u2212 = \u03c9\n2\nkk\u03b1\n4\u03c9SCW2\n(\n2\u03c9TW2 \u2212 \u03c9SCW2\n)\n=\n\u03c92kk\nD2\u03c9\n\u03b14(a2 \u2212 b2) (1.16)\nor |b|> |a| which is precisely the condition proposed by Roskes (1976b). However, this\nis only a su\ufb03cient condition. It misses the case where both \u00b52\u2212 and \u00b52+ are negative,\nwhich occurs for water waves.\nThe condition (1.14) is a su\ufb03cient condition for the right-hand side in (1.11) to\nbe factorizable with real factors. When \u03c3 2+ is factorizable, there is always a wedge\nemanating from the origin in the (\u03b1, \u03b2)-plane where at least one of the roots of (1.10)\nis unstable. The determinant condition (1.14) is satis\ufb01ed for all weakly nonlinear\nSCWs. However, the other potential transverse and longitudinal instabilities are\nworth investigating as they may produce more than one unstable mode, and unstable\nmodes with higher growth rates.\nFigure 3 shows a schematic of the position of the principal modes for SCWs when\n\u0003 is small. In the small wedge around \u03b2 =0 (the longitudinal instabilities) there is\none pair of unstable modes; in the second wedge there are two unstable modes; in\nthe third wedge this reduces to one unstable mode, and then for \u03b2 su\ufb03ciently large,\nthere are no unstable modes. This \ufb01gure changes for other (k, \u0003) values, and the other\npossible diagrams are shown in \u00a7 8.\nFor water waves in deep water with gravity forces only, the dispersion relation is\nD(\u03c9, k, \u0003) = \u03c92 \u2212 g\u03bd, \u03bd =\n\u221a\nk2 + \u00032, (1.17)\nand substitution into (1.14) shows that the determinant is always positive. It is im-\nmediate that there is a long-wave instability of weakly nonlinear short-crested water\nwaves. There is, however, more information about the regions of instability contained\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 12 Jun 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.139\n154 T. J. Bridges and F. E.

The results shown in \ufb01gure 3 give a qualitative description of the transverse\ninstability for weakly nonlinear short-crested Stokes waves when k2 > 2\u00032.\nThe results in \ufb01gure 3 agree with the numerical results of Ioualalen & Kharif (1994)\nfor small |\u03b1| + |\u03b2|: see \ufb01gures 8 and 9 in Ioualalen & Kharif (1994), where they are\nreferred to as class Ia and class Ib instabilities. However, Ioualalen & Kharif (1994)\ndo not remark on the fact that two instabilities can occur at the same parameter\nvalues, but it appears to be implicit in their \ufb01gures 8 and 9.\nA weakly nonlinear analysis of the stability of SCWs is given by Badulin et al.\n(1995) (hereinafter referred to as BSKI). Their results are predominantly qualitative,\nand therefore it is di\ufb03cult to make explicit comparison. They also reduce the weakly\nnonlinear analysis to a quartic polynomial (see their (3.10)). However, they do not\ngive explicit expressions for the coe\ufb03cients and, more importantly, they do not \ufb01nd\nexplicit expressions for the roots. In this paper, explicit expressions for the coe\ufb03cients\n(see (7.10)), and explicit leading-order expressions for the roots are found.\nThe results presented here agree only partially with the earlier SCW stability\nresults of Roskes (1976b) or Mollo-Christensen (1981). While these results have been\ncriticized previously, we now have enough information to give a precise account of\nhow these results are incorrect or incomplete.\nIn the paper of Mollo-Christensen (1981), it is proposed to use the Whitham\ncriterion to predict longitudinal instability with respect to perturbations travelling\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 12 Jun 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.139\nInstability of short-crested Stokes waves 155\nin the same direction as the basic SCW. Using notation from this paper, Mollo-\nChristensen (1981) proposes that the SCW is unstable when\n\u03c9kk\u03c9\nSCW\n2 < 0. (1.20)\nThis condition agrees with the condition \u00b52+ < 0 in (1.13), but it misses the condition\n\u00b52\u2212 < 0. The condition is missing because Mollo-Christensen assumes that SCW is a\nsingle-phase wavetrain rather than a two-phase wavetrain.\nOn the other hand, as \ufb01rst pointed out by Roberts (1983), there is an error in Mollo-\nChristensen (1981) in implementing the criterion (1.20). The derivative \u03c9kk with \u0003=0\nis used, resulting in \u03c9kk < 0 for all \u0003. Hence the change of stability occurring when\n\u03c9kk changes sign is missed. See \u00a7 9 for discussion of the sign of \u00b52+. The condition\n(1.20) also misses the transverse instabilities of SCWs.\nRoskes (1976b) proposes a system of coupled NLS equations as a model for the\nlong-wave instability of SCWs,\n\u2202A1\n\u2202t\n= i\u03b31\n\u22022A1\n\u2202x2\n+ iA1(p11|A1|2 + p12|A2|2),\n\u2202A2\n\u2202t\n= i\u03b32\n\u22022A2\n\u2202x2\n+ iA2(p21|A1|2 + p22|A2|2).\n\uf8fc\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8fd\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8fe (1.21)\nIn Roskes (1976b), \u03b2 is used instead of p. Notation is changed here to avoid confusion\nwith the use of \u03b2 for the perturbation wavenumber.\nThe parameters are adjusted to represent SCWs: \u03b31 = \u03b32, p11 =p22 =p< 0, where\np is proportional to a in (1.6), and p12 =p21 is proportional to b in (1.6). A basic\nstate representative of an SCW is taken and then a linear stability analysis is given.\nRoskes (1976a) shows that in general such a state is unstable when\n\u03b31\u03b32 det\n[\np11 p12\np21 p22\n]\n< 0.\nApplied to (1.6) this condition states that SCWs are unstable when |p12| > |p| which\nis the condition stated in Roskes (1976b). This agrees with the su\ufb03cient condition\n(1.16), but misses the instability when both \u00b52\u2212 and \u00b52+ are negative.\nWith (1.21) as a starting point, Roskes\u2019 analysis of this NLS system, as a repre-\nsentative model for longitudinal instability of SCWs, is correct. However, this coupled\nNLS model is not uniformly valid as a model equation for modulation of weakly\nnonlinear SCWs since it misses the transverse instabilities. This can be seen by looking\nat the derivation of this coupled NLS system in Roskes (1976a). The transformed\nslow space scale (denoted by x here) is de\ufb01ned by\nx = u \u00b7X \u2212 c\u02dcgT (1.22)\nin Roskes (1976a) where c\u02dcg is the group velocity in the direction u where the group\nvelocity of the two waves overlap, X = (X1, X2) are slow space scales, and T is a\nslow time scale. However, in order to balance the time derivative, Roskes introduces\na new time scale t = \u03b5T (this t is the variable in (1.12). Therefore, x in (1.22) must be\ninterpreted as\nx = u \u00b7X \u2212 1\n\u03b5\nc\u02dcgt.\nThis expression shows that the scaling is not valid unless the group velocity overlap\nc\u02dcg is of order \u03b5. However, for SCWs of the water-wave problem it is of order unity.\nIn the limit of long-crested waves the group velocities are nearly the same, but the\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 12 Jun 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.139\n156 T.

Laine-Pearson\nweakly nonlinear expansion for SCWs can also be singular in this limit (Roberts &\nPeregrine 1983).\nThe problem of deriving modulation equations for two-wave interaction when the\ngroup velocity overlap is of order one has been considered in detail by Knobloch &\nGibbon (1991) and Pierce & Knobloch (1994). They show that in this case, the coupl-\ning terms change to non-local terms: one wave senses the other wave only through an\naverage property of the other wave. The distinction is important as the stability results\nfor modulation equations with non-local averaging di\ufb00er signi\ufb01cantly from the results\nfor local equations such as (1.21). Pierce & Knobloch (1994) derive the appropriate\nequations for modulation of standing waves, and it is reasonable to conjecture that\nthe modulation equations for transverse instability of weakly nonlinear SCWs will be\nof a similar non-local form. The modulation equations derived by Pierce & Knobloch\n(1994) for weakly nonlinear standing waves predict that the coupled wave is unstable\nif and only if the component travelling waves are unstable. Although the modulation\nequations of Pierce & Knobloch (1994) do not apply to SCWs, if we extrapolate their\nresults to SCWs, we \ufb01nd that they are consistent with the results found for transverse\ninstability in this paper.\n2. Multi-symplectic structure of wave equations\nThe theory for instability of short-crested waves is developed for the general class of\nPDEs (1.1). In this section, \ufb01rst a semilinear wave equation in two space dimensions\nwill be used to illustrate the transformation to multi-symplectic form, and then the\nmulti-symplectic formulation of water waves is recorded.\n2.1.

(2.2)\nThe canonical Hamiltonian formulation for the nonlinear wave equation is obtained\nby taking the Legendre transform with respect to time only, v = \u2202L\/\u2202ut = ut , and\nthen the governing equations take the form\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n(\nu\nv\n)\n=\n[\n0 1\n\u22121 0\n]\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\u03b4H\n\u03b4u\n\u03b4H\n\u03b4v\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 ,H(u, v) = \u222b ( 12v2 + 12u2x + 12u2y + V (u)) dx dy. (2.3)\nHamiltonian formulations of the nonlinear wave equation are widely used in analysis\n(see Kuksin 2000 and references therein). However a disadvantage of this formulation,\nwhen studying pattern formation, is that the Hamiltonian function and symplectic\nstructure associated with (2.3) require de\ufb01nition of a space of functions over the x-\nand y-directions a priori . In the case of modulation instabilities, the basic state is\nperiodic in space, but the perturbation class is in general quasi-periodic.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 12 Jun 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.139\nInstability of short-crested Stokes waves 157\nMulti-symplecticity puts space and time on an equal footing.

The Legendre transform generates a new Hamiltonian functional\nS(u, v,w, p) = vut + wux + puy \u2212 L = 12 (v2 \u2212 w2 \u2212 p2) + V (u). (2.4)\nThe new Lagrangian for the system is\nL =\n\u222b\nL(u, v,w, p) dt dx dy, L(u, v,w, p) = vut+wux+puy \u2212S(u, v,w, p), (2.5)\nand the governing equations are given by\n0= Lu =\u2212vt \u2212 wx \u2212 py \u2212 Su,\n0= Lv = ut \u2212 Sv,\n0=Lw = ux \u2212 Sw,\n0= Lp = uy \u2212 Sp,\nusing standard \ufb01xed-endpoint conditions for the variations. However, these equations\ndo not have a nice multi-symplectic structure, since the triple of symplectic operators\nare always degenerate. This structure is improved by observing that v, w and p satisfy\nthe constraints px \u2212wy =0, pt +vy =0 and vx+wt =0. Therefore add these constraints\nto the Lagrangian (2.5) with Lagrange multipliers \u03b11, \u03b12 and \u03b13. A divergence-free\ncondition is imposed on the Lagrange multipliers: \u2202t\u03b11 + \u2202x\u03b12 + \u2202y\u03b13 = 0. That this\nequation is the correct one is justi\ufb01ed a posteriori: with this condition, the resulting\nmulti-symplectic system provides an equivalent system of PDEs. With this additional\nconstraint, the Lagrangian density is\nL(u, v,w, p, \u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b13, \u03b14) = vut + wux + puy \u2212 S(u, v,w, p)\n+ \u03b11(px \u2212 wy) + \u03b12(pt + vy) \u2212 \u03b13(vx + wt )\n+ \u03b14(\u2202t\u03b11 + \u2202x\u03b12 + \u2202y\u03b13).

(2.8)\nThe matrix R is an involution (has the property R2 = I) and satis\ufb01es\nRM = MR, RK = KR, RL = \u2212LR, S(RZ) = S(Z). (2.9)\nIn turn, the properties (2.9) imply that RZ is a solution of the wave equation in the\nform (2.7) whenever Z is a solution. The nonlinear wave equation (2.1) is reversible in\nx and t as well, and a multi-symplectic t-reversor and x-reversor can also be de\ufb01ned,\nbut they are not required in the general theory for short crested waves.\nIn addition to being a simple example, the nonlinear wave equation has an\ninteresting property which is quite di\ufb00erent from water waves: the determinant\ncondition (1.14) is not violated. The dispersion relation for (2.1) linearized about the\ntrivial state u=0 is\nD(\u03c9, k, \u0003) = \u03c92 \u2212 k2 \u2212 \u00032 \u2212 V \u2032\u2032(0),\nwhere V \u2032\u2032(0) > 0 by hypothesis. Hence,\ndet\n\uf8ee\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0\nD\u03c9\u03c9 D\u03c9k D\u03c9\u0003 D\u03c9\nDk\u03c9 Dkk Dk\u0003 Dk\nD\u0003\u03c9 D\u0003k D\u0003\u0003 D\u0003\nD\u03c9 Dk D\u0003 0\n\uf8f9\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb=det\n\uf8ee\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0\n2 0 0 2\u03c9\n0 \u22122 0 \u22122k\n0 0 \u22122 \u22122\u0003\n2\u03c9 \u22122k \u22122\u0003 0\n\uf8f9\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb=\u221216V \u2032\u2032(0) < 0. (2.10)\nTherefore, by choosing V \u2032\u2032\u2032(0)= 0 and V \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032(0)> 0 (since sign(\u03c9kk \u03c9TW2 )= sign(V \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2032(0))\nin this case), the weakly nonlinear SCWs of (2.1) are stable to long-wave transverse\nperturbations. They may, of course, still be unstable to short-wave transverse\nperturbations or longitudinal perturbations.\n2.2.

(2.21)\nThe water-wave problem has the appropriate y- reversibility that is required for the\nexistence of SCWs. Let\nR = diag(1, 1, I, I,\u2212I).\nThen it is easily veri\ufb01ed that\nRM(RZ) = +M(Z)R, RL(RZ) = +K(Z)R, RL(RZ) = \u2212L(Z)R,\nand S(RZ) = S(Z), where RZ=RZ(x,\u2212y, t).\nThe skew-symmetric operators M(Z), K(Z) and L(Z) are non-constant. However,\nwith a simple transformation, they can be reduced to constant skew-symmetric\noperators (see Bridges 2001). Therefore, it will be assumed hereinafter that the water-\nwave equations are transformed and so are in the standard form (1.1).\nThe multi-symplectic formulation of water waves is a generalization of the classical\nHamiltonian formulation of water waves due to Zakharov (1968). De\ufb01ning,\n\u2207\u02dcH (Z) = \u2207S(Z) \u2212 K(Z)Zx \u2212 L(Z)Zy, (2.22)\nwhere \u2207\u02dc is a gradient operator de\ufb01ned with respect to an inner product that includes\nintegration over x and y, the equations can be written in the form\nM(Z)Zt = \u2207\u02dcH (Z).\nThis system is the Zakharov formulation rewritten in terms of the Z-variables. The\nmulti-symplectic structure provides a re\ufb01nement of the classical Hamiltonian structure,\nin that it decomposes the Hamiltonian to generate independent symplectic structures\nfor the x- and y-directions.\n3. The general oblique two-wave interaction\nMotivated by the nonlinear wave equation and the water-wave problem, the starting\npoint for the analysis is the general class of abstract Hamiltonian PDEs of the form\nMZt + KZx + LZy = \u2207S(Z), Z \u2208\u0001, (3.1)\nunder the hypotheses that M, K and L are any constant skew-symmetric operators,\nS is any given smooth function, which does not depend explicitly on x, y or t . The\nlinear space \u0001 is either \u0002n or in the case of water waves it is an inner product space\nof functions in the z-direction. The precise speci\ufb01cation of \u0001 is not required in the\nsequel.

In this setting, an abstract de\ufb01nition of a\nshort-crested wave can be given (see Appendix A).\nIn this section, the general two-wave interaction is considered; that is, general\nsolutions of (3.1) of the form\nZ(x, y, t) = Z\u0302(\u03b81, \u03b82) where \u03b8j = kjx + \u0003jy + \u03c9j t (j = 1, 2), (3.3)\nand Z\u0302 is a 2\u03c0-periodic function of \u03b81 and \u03b82. There is an arbitrary phase shift in each\n\u03b8j which is suppressed for brevity.\nIn addition to its importance as an embedding for SCWs, the oblique two-wave\ninteraction has independent interest in remote-sensing stochastic models, and a model\nfor the double-peaked power spectrum observed in shallow water-wave dynamics\nLonguet-Higgins 1962; Willebrand 1975; Weber & Barrick 1977; Pierson 1993;\nElfouhaily et al. 2000 and references therein).\nThe main result of this section is a constrained variational principle for the two-\nwave interaction which generalizes previous variational principles for quasi-periodic\npatterns (Bridges 1998) and collinear two-phase wavetrains (Bridges & Laine-Pearson\n2001). Variational principles can be derived for SCWs directly, as in Bridges, Dias &\nMenasce (2001) for example, but these variational principles for SCWs do not contain\nenough information for a stability analysis.\nThe solutions Z\u0302(\u03b81, \u03b82) can also be interpreted as steady waves travelling in some\noblique direction (Milewski & Keller 1996). Let\n\u03981 =\n\u00032\u03b81 \u2212 \u00031\u03b82\nk1\u00032 \u2212 k2\u00031 , \u03982 =\nk2\u03b81 \u2212 k1\u03b82\nk1\u00032 \u2212 k2\u00031 .\nThen clearly,\n\u03981 = x \u2212 cxt, \u03982 = y \u2212 cyt, with (cx, cy) =\n(\n\u03c92\u00031 \u2212 \u03c91\u00032\nk1\u00032 \u2212 \u00031k2 ,\n\u03c92k1 \u2212 \u03c91k2\nk1\u00032 \u2212 \u00031k2\n)\n.\nThe transformation (\u03b81, \u03b82) \u000b\u2192 (\u03981,\u03982) is invertible if k1\u00032 \u2212 k2\u00031 \u0004=0. Note that this\nnon-degeneracy condition holds even in the SCW limit (reducing to k\u0003 \u0004= 0). In\ntransformed coordinates, a doubly periodic wave can be expressed in the form\nZ\u0302(\u03b81, \u03b82) = W\u0302 (\u03981,\u03982) = W\u0302 (x \u2212 cxt, y \u2212 cyt),\ni.e. a steady wave travelling with phasespeed vector c=(cx, cy). However, for the varia-\ntional characterization, the primitive form of Z\u0302(\u03b81, \u03b82) is used as the parameter struc-\nture is more useful.\nThe extension from SCWs to the non-resonant two-wave interaction takes a\nresonant wave to a non-resonant wave, and therefore we would expect small divisors.\nHowever, it is not this embedding that gives rise to small divisors, because there\nis a continuous symmetry (the translation invariance in the y-direction on periodic\nfunctions gives an O(2) symmetry), and so the variation of the frequencies and wave-\nnumbers is smooth. In \ufb01nite dimensions this is reminiscent of the spherical pendulum,\nand in in\ufb01nite dimensions it is reminiscent of the similar issues with standing waves\nand their embedding in a collinear two-wave interaction (see Bridges & Laine-Pearson\n2004 for further discussion of this issue).\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 12 Jun 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.139\n162 T. J. Bridges and F. E. Laine-Pearson\nOn the other hand, there is an intrinsic issue of small divisors that arises owing to the\ncountable number of pure imaginary eigenvalues in the spectrum of the linearization\nabout the trivial state. See Craig & Nicholls (2002, \u00a7 4.4), for a discussion of this issue\nfor three-dimensional water waves. However, when we consider capillary\u2013gravity\nthree-dimensional waves instead of pure gravity waves three-dimensional waves, the\nsmall-divisor issue disappears and a rigorous proof of such doubly periodic waves\ncan be obtained (Craig & Nicholls 2000).\nThe governing equation for a general two-wave interaction Z\u0302(\u03b81, \u03b82) is obtained\nfrom (3.1) which transforms to\nJ1\n\u2202Z\u0302\n\u2202\u03b81\n+ J2\n\u2202Z\u0302\n\u2202\u03b82\n= \u2207S(Z\u0302) where Jj = \u03c9jM+ kjK+ \u0003jL. (3.4)\nThe operators Jj \u2202\u03b8j are formally gradient operators, and this is the basis of a\nvariational principle. The product of the skew-symmetric operator Jj and the\nderivative \u2202\u03b8j is symmetric. Therefore the product can de\ufb01ne a quadratic form whose\ngradient then formally recovers the operator.\nFor j =1, 2, de\ufb01ne the following six functionals for the two interacting waves\nAj (Z) =\n\u222e\n1\n2\n\u2329\nM\n\u2202Z\n\u2202\u03b8j\n, Z\n\u232a\nd\u03b8, Bj (Z) =\n\u222e\n1\n2\n\u2329\nK\n\u2202Z\n\u2202\u03b8j\n, Z\n\u232a\nd\u03b8,\nCj (Z) =\n\u222e\n1\n2\n\u2329\nL\n\u2202Z\n\u2202\u03b8j\n, Z\n\u232a\nd\u03b8 where\n\u222e\n( ) d\u03b8 =\n1\n(2\u03c0)2\n\u222b 2\u03c0\n0\n\u222b 2\u03c0\n0\n( ) d\u03b81 d\u03b82.\n\uf8fc\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8fd\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8fe (3.5)\nFor the case of water waves, these functionals are expressible in the classical form\nAj (Z) =\n\u222e\n\u2212\u03a6 \u2202\u03b7\n\u2202\u03b8j\nd\u03b8, Bj (Z) =\n\u222e \u222b \u03b7\n\u2212\u221e\nu\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202\u03b8j\ndz d\u03b8, Cj (Z) =\n\u222e \u222b \u03b7\n\u2212\u221e\nv\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202\u03b8j\ndz d\u03b8.\n(3.6)\nThe functionals Aj can be identi\ufb01ed with a multi-phase form of wave action\nand the functionals Bj and Cj can be identi\ufb01ed with wave action \ufb02uxes (Whitham\n1974). The di\ufb00erence here is that we do not use a Lagrangian formulation, and the\nactions and action \ufb02uxes have a geometrical characterization (Bridges 1997b). With the\ngeometrical formulation, the actions and action \ufb02uxes enter the linear stability analysis\nin an explicit way and so stability results can be obtained without having to use a\nmodulation equation such as the multi-phase modulation equation of Ablowitz &\nBenney (1970).\nConsider the Lagrange functional\nF(Z;\u03c9, k, \u0003)=S(Z)\u2212\n2\u2211\nj=1\n(\u03c9jAj +kjBj +\u0003jCj ) where S(Z)=\n\u222e\nS(Z) d\u03b8.

(3.12)\nAlthough we have restricted attention to the two-wave interaction here, it should\nbe apparent that the basic formulation can be generalized to N-wave interactions.\nWhen there are N interacting waves, there will be 3N functionals and 3N Lagrange\nmultipliers. For the case of the three-wave interaction of water waves, this variational\nprinciple has been applied by Laine-Pearson (2002) to obtain results for the weakly\nnonlinear three-wave interaction.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 12 Jun 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.139\n164 T. J. Bridges and F. E. Laine-Pearson\n4. Weakly nonlinear oblique two-wave interaction of water waves\nIn this section, the variational principle of \u00a7 3 is applied to weakly nonlinear water\nwaves. The motivation is twofold: to derive existing results in the literature on the two-\nwave interaction (e.g. Longuet-Higgins 1962; Weber & Barrick 1977; Pierson 1993)\nfrom a variational perspective, and secondly, to obtain information which is used for\nthe limit to SCWs. Some generalities about the weakly nonlinear two-wave interaction\nare also discussed.\nAt the linear level, a two-wave interaction solution of (3.1) is of the form\nZ\u0302(\u03b81, \u03b82) =\n2\u2211\nj=1\n(Aj \u03be j exp(i\u03b8j ) + c.c.) with D(\u03c9j , kj , \u0003j ) = 0, j = 1, 2,\nfor any complex numbers A1 and A2, where \u03be j is an eigenvector and D(\u03c9, k, \u0003) is the\ndispersion function. For gravity water waves in in\ufb01nite depth, D(\u03c9, k, \u0003)=\u03c92 \u2212\ng\n\u221a\nk2 + \u00032.\nThe simplest nonlinear problem of pairwise interaction is then to study the persist-\nence of such a wave interaction in the nonlinear problem for small amplitude. Such\nan interaction will not persist for all (A1, A2)\u2208\u00032 and one purpose of a weakly\nnonlinear analysis is to determine under what conditions we can expect such an\ninteraction to persist. The weakly nonlinear theory leads to a set of amplitude\nequations of the form\n0 = A1(D(\u03c91, k1, \u00031) + \u039b11|A1|2 + \u039b12|A2|2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7),\n0 = A2(D(\u03c92, k2, \u00032) + \u039b21|A1|2 + \u039b22|A2|2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7),\n\uf8fc\uf8fd\uf8fe (4.1)\nwith \u039b12 =\u039b21. These equations generalize the amplitude equations (1.6) for SCWs\nto amplitude equations for the two-wave interaction. Here we give a brief account of\nthe derivation of this equation for weakly nonlinear two-wave interaction for water\nwaves.\nAccording to the variational principle, the solutions correspond to critical points of\nS restricted to level sets of the functionals (Aj ,Bj ,Cj ) for j = 1, 2. The necessary\ncondition for the variational principle is to \ufb01nd critical points of the unconstrained\nfunctional (3.7). We seek solutions that are 2\u03c0-periodic in \u03b81 and \u03b82 through a double\nFourier series of the form\nZ\u0302(\u03b81, \u03b82) =\n\u2211\n(m,n)\u2208\u00042\nZmn exp(i(m\u03b81 + n\u03b82)).\nSince Z = (\u03a6, \u03b7, \u03c6, u, v)T we can determine \u03a6 , u and v from \u03c6 and \u03b7 using\n\u03a6 = \u03c6|z=\u03b7,\n(\nu\nv\n)\n=\n(\nk1 k2\n\u00031 \u00032\n)(\n\u2202\u03c6\/\u2202\u03b81\n\u2202\u03c6\/\u2202\u03b82\n)\n.\nThe problem is then reduced to solving for the velocity potential and free-surface\nelevation.

Long-wave instability of weakly nonlinear SCWs\nA general theory for long-wave instability of weakly nonlinear SCWs is now given,\nstarting with the results for the weakly nonlinear two-wave interaction.\nZ(x, y, t) = A1\u03be 1e\ni(k1x+\u00031y+\u03c91t) + A2\u03be 2e\ni(k2x+\u00032y+\u03c92t) + c.c. + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\nwhere \u03be j satis\ufb01es\n[HessZS(0) \u2212 ikjK \u2212 i\u0003jL \u2212 i\u03c9jM]\u03be j = 0, (7.1)\nwith associated dispersion relation D(\u03c9j , kj , \u0003j ) = 0. When the phase space is \ufb01nite\ndimensional (such as the nonlinear wave equation in \u00a7 2.1), the dispersion relation is\nde\ufb01ned by\nD(\u03c9, k, \u0003) = det [HessZS(0) \u2212 ikK \u2212 i\u0003L \u2212 i\u03c9M] ,\nand in in\ufb01nite dimensions it is the condition for solvability of (7.1).\nThe reduced equation which generalizes (4.2) is\nF\u0302(|A1|2, |A2|2, \u03c9, k, \u0003) = D(\u03c91, k1, \u00031)|A1|2 + D(\u03c92, k2, \u00032)|A2|2\n+ 1\n2\n\u039b11|A1|4 + \u039b12|A1|2|A2|2 + 12\u039b22|A2|4 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (7.2)\nBy construction, the two-wave interaction determined by this reduced equation is a\ndeformation of a family of SCWs. Therefore, in the SCW limit,\nk2 = k1 = k, \u00032 = \u2212\u00031 = \u2212\u0003, \u03c92 = \u03c91 = \u2212\u03c9, |A2| = |A1| = |A|, (7.3)\nthe coe\ufb03cients of the nonlinear quartic terms reduce to\n\u039b11 \u2192 a, \u039b22 \u2192 a, \u039b12 \u2192 b, (7.4)\nwhere a and b are the coe\ufb03cients associated with SCWs as in (1.6).\nIn the SCW limit, the quadratic coe\ufb03cients in (7.2) also simplify. The SCW\nsymmetry (3.2) is inherited by the dispersion relation: D(\u03c9, k, \u0003) = D(\u03c9, k,\u2212\u0003),\nand the Hamiltonian structure induces the symmetry D(\u2212\u03c9,\u2212k,\u2212\u0003) = D(\u03c9, k, \u0003).\nHence the dispersion relation for SCWs can always be expressed in the form\nD(\u03c9, k, \u0003) = d\u0302(\u03c92, \u03c9k, k2, \u00032).\nThese symmetry properties are useful for evaluating the stability matrices for the\ngeneral weakly nonlinear SCW stability analysis, without explicitly knowing the\ndispersion relation.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 12 Jun 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.139\n172 T.

There are three regions in (k, \u0003) space and for each of these regions the\nunstable wedges in the (\u03b1, \u03b2)-plane are shown in \ufb01gure 7.\nFor weakly three-dimensional SCWs, that is; when \u0003 is small (and \u00032 <k2\/2), there\nare two unstable wedges, a as shown in \ufb01gure 7(a). In the lower unstable wedge,\nthere are two unstable modes and in the middle wedge, there is one unstable mode\n(as shown in \ufb01gure 3).\nIn the intermediate region, when 1\/k22, < \u00032 < 2k2, there is only one unstable wedge,\nas shown in \ufb01gure 7(b), and it has only one unstable mode. In the large \u0003 region,\nwhere \u00032 > 2k2, there are again two unstable wedges with the higher wedge (darker\nshading) now having two unstable modes, as shown in \ufb01gure 7(c). The location of\nthe unstable wedges in \ufb01gure 7(c) is the reverse of that in \ufb01gure 7(a).\nThe results in \ufb01gure 7 can also be interpreted in terms of a wave re\ufb02ection o\ufb00 a\nwall. Consider the case of an incident wave of wavelength 2\u03c0\/\u03bd, where \u03bd =\n\u221a\nk2 + \u00032,\nbeing fully re\ufb02ected o\ufb00 a vertical wall. Let k = \u03bd sin \u03b8 and \u0003 = \u03bd cos \u03b8 . Then, \u03b8 is the\nangle between the direction of propagation of the incident wave and the normal to\nthe wall (cf. Roberts 1983). In terms of the angle \u03b8 , the critical values in \ufb01gure 7 are\n\u0003\/k =\n\u221a\n2 \u21d2 \u03b8 = tan\u22121(1\/\u221a2) \u2248 35.26\u25e6,\n\u0003\/k = 1\u221a\n2\n\u21d2 \u03b8 = tan\u22121(\u221a2) \u2248 54.73\u25e6.\n\uf8fc\uf8fd\uf8fe (8.3)\nThe limit \u03b8 \u2192 90\u25e6 corresponds to the limit where the two waves are collinear Stokes\ntravelling waves. Hence, \ufb01gure 7(a) corresponds the the region closest to the travelling,\nwave limit. Note that this limit is singular so the results are not valid in the limit\n\u03b8 \u2192 90. Figure 7(a) is consistent with the fact that the Stokes travelling-wave is\nmodulation unstable, but it also shows a di\ufb00erence from the travelling-wave case: the\ndarker shaded region has two modes of instability, whereas a Stokes travelling wave\nwould have only one unstable mode. The limit \u03b8 \u2192 0\u25e6 corresponds to the standing-\nwave limit. Near \u03b8 = 0, the instability regions in \ufb01gure 7(c) are just the opposite of\n\ufb01gure 7(a), with the strongest region of instability predominantly in the y-direction.\nThis limit is consistent with the modulation instability of pure standing waves; further\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 12 Jun 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.139\nInstability of short-crested Stokes waves 177\ndetails of the instability of pure standing waves using the multi-symplectic framework\ncan be found in Bridges & Laine-Pearson (2004).\n9. Longitudinal instabilities of weakly nonlinear short-crested water waves\nWhen \u03b2 =0, the leading-order term for the roots of the stability quartic (7.10)\ndepends also on the terms of order |A|4 in the coe\ufb03cients. When \u03b2 =0 and |A| = 0,\nthe stability quartic (7.10) has a quartic root\n\b(\u2126,\u03b1, \u03b2) =\n1\n|\u039b| (D\u03c9\u2126 + Dk\u03b1)\n4.\nHence, the perturbation of this root for |A| \u0004= 0 has a leading-order term of the order\nof the fourth root of the perturbation. Since the perturbation is of order |A|2, the\nleading-order expansion for the perturbed quartic root is of the form\n\u2126 = \u2212Dk\nD\u03c9\n\u03b1 + \u21261|A|1\/2 + \u21262|A| + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 .\nHowever, owing to symmetry, the term \u21261 = 0 and the leading-order term is of order\n|A|, but the coe\ufb03cient \u21262 then depends on the terms of order |A|4 in the coe\ufb03cients of\n(7.10). Let \u03b41 be as de\ufb01ned in \u00a7 7.1, then a calculation shows \u2013 to leading order in |A| \u2013\nthat the quartic root associated with \u03b2 =0 perturbs into the four roots (expressing\nthe four values of \u21262 as \u00b1\u00b5\u00b1)\n\u2126 =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\n\u2212Dk\nD\u03c9\n\u03b1 + \u00b5+|A| + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n\u2212Dk\nD\u03c9\n\u03b1 + \u00b5+|A| + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n\u2212Dk\nD\u03c9\n\u03b1 \u2212 \u00b5\u2212|A| + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n\u2212Dk\nD\u03c9\n\u03b1 + \u00b5\u2212|A| + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\nwith \u00b52\u00b1 = \u2212 (a \u00b1 b)D4\u03c9 \u03b41\u03b1\n2. (9.1)\nHowever, in \u00a7 7.1 it was shown that \u03b41 = \u03c9kkD3\u03c9. Substituting this expression into \u00b52\u00b1\nand using the de\ufb01nitions of \u03c9TW2 and \u03c9\nSCW\n2 recovers the expressions in (1.13).\nThe eight stability exponents are given by \u03bb = \u00b1i\u2126 , with \u2126 taking the four values\nabove. Clearly, stability is determined by the signs of \u00b52\u00b1, and the signs of \u00b52\u00b1 are\ndetermined by the signs of (a + b), (a \u2212 b) and \u03b41. With k = \u03bd sin \u03b8 and \u0003 = \u03bd cos \u03b8 ,\nthe coe\ufb03cients a and b (= \u03a5 in (4.3) in the SCW limit) can be expressed in the form\na=\u22124g\u03bd2,\nb=4g\u03bd2\n(\n\u22122 + 6 cos2 \u03b8 + 8 cos\n4 \u03b8\nsin \u03b8 \u2212 2 + 2 cos\n4 \u03b8\n)\n.\nThe normalized (divided by 4g\u03bd2) expressions for (a + b) and (a \u2212 b) are shown in\n\ufb01gure 8.\nHowever, longitudinal stability is determined by the the product of (a \u00b1 b) with\n\u03b41 (or \u03c9kk). The sign of \u03b41 is determined by the sign of 2\u0003\n2 \u2212 k2 and this function\nis positive for \u03b8 small and changes sign when \u03b8 \u2248 54.74\u25e6. Therefore, longitudinal\ninstability for |A| small is determined by the inequalities\n(a + b)(k2 \u2212 2\u00032) < 0 or (a \u2212 b)(k2 \u2212 2\u00032) < 0.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 12 Jun 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.139\n178 T.

The angle used by Roskes is equal to 2(90\u2212\u03b8), so \u03b8 \u2248 22\u25e6 corresponds\nto Roskes\u2019 136\u25e6 and \u03b8 \u2248 63\u25e6 corresponds to Roskes\u2019 55\u25e6. However, his analysis misses\nthe unstable region 55\u25e6 <\u03b8 < 63\u25e6 because both \u00b52\u00b1 are negative in that region.\nThe qualitative position of the roots for \u03b2 =0 will persist for \u03b2 small. Therefore,\nwe expect the position of the roots in \ufb01gure 10 to persist in a small wedge around\nthe axis \u03b2 =0. This small wedge of longitudinal instabilities is consistent with the\nnumerical calculations reported in \ufb01gures 8 and 9 in Ioualalen & Kharif (1994).\n9.1. Instability of short-crested capillary\u2013gravity water waves\nThe addition of capillarity brings new features that are worthy of mention. The issues\nare just sketched in this subsection. The \ufb01rst new feature is that a rigorous theory of\nexistence for capillary\u2013gravity SCWs \u2013 and their deformation into the non-resonant\ntwo-wave interaction \u2013 is available (Craig & Nicholls 2000), suggesting that they are\nmore robust than pure gravity waves. Indeed, it is conceivable that a rigorous theory\nfor instability could also be developed for the case of capillary\u2013gravity SCWs. The\nsecond issue is the larger range of possibilities for instability. For example, all the\ncritical coe\ufb03cients (the determinant (8.1), and the parameters \u03c3 2+, \u03c3\n2\u2212 \u00b52\u2212 and \u00b52+) have\nadditional sign changes in parameter space. A clue to the range of possibilities for\ntransverse instabilities can be seen from the range of instabilities of oblique capillary\u2013\ngravity travelling waves (cf. \u00a7 5 of Bridges 1996). When capillary forces are ad-\nded, the longitudinal instabilities will also change. For example, it is shown inBridges,\nDias & Menasce (2001) that the coe\ufb03cients a and b have sign changes along lines in\nthe (\u03b8, \u03c4 ) plane where \u03c4 is the Bond number.\n10. Concluding remarks\nTwo directions in which the theory here can be extended are the stability of SCWs\nin shallow water, and the stability of the resonant and non-resonant three-wave\ninteraction.\nThe issue with shallow-water and \ufb01nite-depth SCWs is the mean \ufb02ow which can\nin\ufb02uence stability. However, the theory presented here can be combined with the\ntheory in Bridges et al. (2001). The idea would be to couple the six-parameter\ntwo-wave interaction with the three-parameter mean \ufb02ow in Bridges et al. (2001),\nleading to a nine-parameter problem. The stability polynomial will be a sixth-order\npolynomial in this case. Theoretically the strategy is clear, but the details will be\nlengthy for this case. There are questions to be tackled, however. It would be of great\ninterest to have analytical results for weakly nonlinear SCWs in shallow water, and\nalso there are open questions about the stability of two-wave interactions in shallow\nwater (cf. Onorato et al. (2002)).\nThe resonant and non-resonant three-wave interaction is the next logical step. There\nis enough symmetry (when the three waves are oblique), so the idea of embedding the\nresonant interaction in a three-phase non-resonant interaction still makes theoretical\nsense. In in\ufb01nite depth this will be a nine-parameter problem, and the stability\npolynomial will be sixth order. In \ufb01nite depth, when mean \ufb02ow e\ufb00ects are accounted\nfor, there will be twelve parameters, and the stability polynomial will be eighth order.\nSome results on the weakly nonlinear three-wave interaction of water waves in in\ufb01nite\ndepth have been obtained by Laine-Pearson (2002).\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 12 Jun 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.139\n180 T.

Some properties of short-crested wave solutions of multi-symplectic\nPDEs\nWhat precisely is a short-crested Stokes wave? Key features are (a) periodicity in\nall space directions and time; (b) uniformly travelling; (c) re\ufb02ection symmetric in the\ndirection orthogonal to the direction of propagation. In the multi-symplectic setting,\nthe concept of a reversor is used to give a precise de\ufb01nition.\nA solution, Z\u0302(x, y, t) of (3.1), is called a short-crested wave if it is periodic in x, y\nand t , is travelling in the x-direction (depends on x and t in linear combination only)\nand satis\ufb01es R Z\u0302(x, y, t) = Z\u0302(x, y, t).\nAn immediate consequence of this de\ufb01nition is that the transverse momentum of\na short-crested wave is identically zero. An application of Noether\u2019s theorem shows\nthat the appropriate form for the density of the momentum vector is\nM = ( 1\n2\n\u3008MZx,Z\u3009, 12\u3008MZy,Z\u3009\n)\n.\nThis form can be veri\ufb01ed by using Noether\u2019s theorem, as in the Appendix of Bridges &\nLaine-Pearson (2004), or by direct calculation as below.\nFor functions satisfying (3.1), we have the following conservation law for the\ntransverse momentum\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n(\n1\n2\n\u3008MZy,Z\u3009)+ \u2202\n\u2202x\n(\n1\n2\n\u3008KZy,Z\u3009)+ \u2202\n\u2202y\n(\nS(Z) \u2212 1\n2\n\u3008MZt, Z\u3009 \u2212 12\u3008KZx,Z\u3009\n)\n= 0,\nand soon a space of functions that are periodic in x and y (and normalizing the\nperiod to 2\u03c0 in each direction)\nMy =\n\u222b\n\u00052\n1\n2\n\u3008MZy,Z\u3009 dx dy = 1\n(2\u03c0)2\n\u222b 2\u03c0\n0\n\u222b 2\u03c0\n0\n1\n2\n\u3008MZy,Z\u3009 dx dy\nis conserved in time. For water waves, this functional can be expressed in the form\nMy =\n\u222b\n\u00052\n\u2212\u03a6\u03b7y dx dy.\nOne implication of the above de\ufb01nition of SCWs is that it implies immediately\nthat My \u2013 when evaluated on an SCW \u2013 is identically zero for all time. This follows\nsince\nMy(RZ) =\n\u222b\n\u00052\n1\n2\n\u3008MR(Z(x,\u2212y, t))y,RZ(x,\u2212y, t)\u3009 dx dy (by de\ufb01nition),\n= \u2212\n\u222b\n\u00052\n1\n2\n\u3008MRZy(x,\u2212y, t),RZ(x,\u2212y, t)\u3009 dx dy,\n= \u2212\n\u222b\n\u00052\n1\n2\n\u3008RMZy(x,\u2212y, t),RZ(x,\u2212y, t)\u3009 dx dy (using RM = MR),\n= \u2212\n\u222b\n\u00052\n1\n2\n\u3008MZy(x,\u2212y, t), Z(x,\u2212y, t)\u3009 dx dy\n(since R preserves the inner product),\n= \u2212\n\u222b\n\u00052\n1\n2\n\u3008MZy(x, y, t), Z(x, y, t)\u3009 dx dy\n(transforming y \u000b\u2192 \u2212y and using periodicity),\n= \u2212My(Z).\nTherefore, if Z\u0302(x, y, t) is an SCW and so R Z\u0302 = Z\u0302, it is immediate that My(Z\u0302) = 0.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 12 Jun 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.139\nInstability of short-crested Stokes waves 181\nMomentum\nEnergy SCWs\nregion\nTwo-\nwave\nOTW OTW\nFigure 11.
