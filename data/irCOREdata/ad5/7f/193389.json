In an invertebrate model for\ngoal-directed limb movements, the scratching behavior of lo-\ncusts, a hindleg is aimed toward a tactile stimulus on the ipsilat-\neral wing (Berkowitz and Laurent, 1996; Matheson, 1997; Du\u00a8rr\nand Matheson, 2003). The targeting accuracy is maintained even\nif the tibia is loaded so as to increase its inertia 12-fold (Matheson\nand Du\u00a8rr, 2003). Moreover, this increase of mass does not affect\nkinematic variables such as movement velocity or initial direc-\ntion, indicating that the leg muscles must generate significantly\nmore force to execute the same movement. To understand limb\ntargeting and load compensation requires an understanding of\nthe sensorimotor transformations that are involved in movement\ncontrol. These transformations include the activation dynamics\nof muscles, intrinsic muscle and tendon properties, moment\narms, and mechanical properties of the joints (Zajac, 1993;\nPandy, 2001). Few studies integrated these factors to demonstrate\ntheir influence on control of behavior (for review, see Dickinson\net al., 2000), because the complexity of the parameter space\nmakes it difficult to identify and measure all relevant parameters\nin an unrestrained animal.\nNeuromechanical modeling can simulate the natural move-\nment of a limb using a defined input, and sensitivity analyses can\nevaluate the relative importance of measured physiological vari-\nables. Biomechanical models have been applied to examine the\nstabilizing mechanical properties of limbs during cockroach\nwalking and running. In cockroach running (Full and Ahn, 1995;\nJindrich and Full, 2002), a model comprising only a spring-and-\ndamper system illustrates how the physical properties act to sta-\nbilize the animal against mechanical disturbances. The human\nmusculoskeletal system has been similarly analyzed during loco-\nmotion (Wagner and Blickhan, 1999; Geyer et al., 2003). In frogs,\nthe muscles stabilize wiping movements without neuronal activ-\nity (Richardson et al., 2005). Brezina et al. (2000b) transformed a\nneural input signal into rhythmic movements of Aplysia feeding\nbehavior using a neuromuscular model, which was also analyzed\nto determine optimal neural patterns (Brezina et al., 2000a).\nWe used a biomechanical model to determine the role of mus-\nculoskeletal properties for the generation of unconstrained goal-\ndirected limb movements in a prominent arthropod model or-\nganism, the locust (Burrows, 1996). We analyzed the motor\nbehavior of hindleg scratching (see Fig. 1), during which the an-\nimal detects a target location on the wing surface and moves its\nReceived Jan. 13, 2006; revised March 12, 2006; accepted March 12, 2006.\nThis workwas supported by Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council Advanced Research Fellow-\nship AF13046 (TM) and a studentship of the Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes (J.Z.).

This behavior permits a\ndetailed analysis of the interaction of neurophysiology and bio-\nmechanics because it comprises a continuum of targeted move-\nments of a limb with extremely well known joint and muscle\nanatomy (Hoyle, 1955a; Burrows and Horridge, 1974; Heitler,\n1974) and completely described motoneuron innervation\n(Hoyle, 1955a; Sasaki and Burrows, 1998). This allowed us to\nmodel the complete neuromechanical transformation from mo-\ntoneuron recordings to joint movement. Comparison of trials of\nthe same animals with unloaded and loaded legs allowed us to\nevaluate the same model under different force regimens and to\ninvestigate the significance of individual model components for\nload compensation.\nWe find that a model using passive elasticity and damping is\nsufficient to simulate tibial movement equally well as a model\nwith additional active properties. The long time constants of\nmuscle activation and deactivation result in strong co-\ncontraction of the antagonists, leading to substantial joint stiff-\nness. We show how both of these aspects affect neural control of\ngoal-directed limb movements and load compensation.\nMaterials andMethods\nExperimental setup and stimulus protocol. Experiments were performed\non female locusts (Schistocerca gregaria Forsk\u00e5l) taken from a crowded\ncolony at the Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge (Cam-\nbridge, UK).\nLocusts were tethered above a foam ball using a fine wire noose placed\naround the pronotum. This allowed the animal to freely move its legs and\nadjust the posture (Matheson, 1997). The eyes and ocelli were blacked\nout using water-based black acrylic paint (Cryla, Daler-Rowney, UK).\nThe left mesothoracic leg was amputated at the base of the femur to\nprevent the locust gripping the myogram wires (see below), and the\nstump was sealed with a wax plug (Lactona Surgident, Philadelphia, PA).\nA foot rest positioned posterior to the metathoracic coxal joint and ven-\ntral to the abdomen was used to maintain the same start position before\neach leg movement. Retroreflective circular markers of 0.5 or 1 mm\ndiameter were cut from reflective tape (Scotchlite; 3M, St. Paul, MN) and\nattached to specific locations on the hindleg and thorax (Fig. 1) using\nclear nail lacquer. The forewing was notionally divided into five regions\nof equal length. The most anterior and posterior regions were used as the\ntwo stimulus sites and correspond to sites 1 and 2 (anterior) and 4 and 5\n(posterior) used by Du\u00a8rr and Matheson (2003). Light tactile stimulation\nusing a fine paintbrush within one of the defined stimulus regions was\nused to elicit grooming behavior. Posterior and anterior stimuli were\napplied randomly until at least 20 scratches were recorded for each stim-\nulus site.\nIn loaded condition, a weight of 2 mm diameter and 142 mg was\nattached to a distal tibia position, \u00012 mm proximal to the tibia\u2013tarsus\njoint. The animals were filmed from a lateral view, using a color video\ncamera (TK-C1380; JVC, London, UK) with standard PAL resolution,\noperated at a shutter speed of 1\u2044500 s. The images were taped on a VHS\nvideo recorder (NV-HS9000; Panasonic, Secaucus, NJ), displayed on a\nmonitor, and played back for capture using a personal computer video\ninterface card (miroVIDEO DC30 plus; Pinnacle Systems, Mountain\nView, CA).\nWe filmed N \u0002 5 animals and used n \u0002 80 trials (16 trials per animal,\nfour trials for each unloaded and loaded condition as well as anterior and\nposterior stimulus). If more than four trials were recorded for each con-\ndition, we selected the trials with the largest number of cyclic grooming\nmovements. Statistics were calculated using the statistics toolbox of Mat-\nlab 6.4 (MathWorks, Natick, MA). Average values are given as medians\nwith the interquartile range (IQR).\nMotion capture of scratching movements. The recorded videos were\ndeinterlaced, and a threshold filter was applied to obtain the marker\npositions in each video frame. Joint angles for each frame were computed\nusing motion capture software (Zakotnik et al., 2004), using a three-\ndimensional kinematic model of the hindleg. The model contained five\nrotational degrees of freedom (DOF): the body\u2013 coxa joint was a ball\njoint with three DOF (retraction\/protraction, pronation\/supination, and\nlevation\/depression), the coxa-trochanter joint had one DOF (levation\/\ndepression), and so did the femur\u2013tibia (FT) joint (extension\/flexion).\nThe tibia\u2013tarsus joint and the tarsus were omitted in the model, because\nthey do not contribute to aiming the tibia (Du\u00a8rr and Matheson, 2003).\nA disambiguation algorithm (Zakotnik and Du\u00a8rr, 2005) determined\nthe joint angle time course for each of the five joint axes. A quintic\nsmoothing spline then used this accuracy measure to smooth the data\nwithin measurement accuracy (Zakotnik and Du\u00a8rr, 2005). In any time\nstep, the smoothed joint angles did not deviate more than 2\u00b0 from the\nunsmoothed angles. Example joint angles for a scratching movement are\nshown in Figure 1.\nElectrophysiology and identification of tibial motor neurons. Muscle ac-\ntivity was recorded from the extensor and flexor tibiae muscles using\nmyogram electrodes made of pairs of 20-\u0001m-diameter polyester-\ninsulated copper wires that were passed from the recording sites in the\nmetathoracic leg to the pronotum, fixed at intervals to the cuticle by small\ndrops of beeswax. The tips of the wires were stripped of their insulation to\nimprove the recorded signal. In each animal, three recording sites were\nselected based on the known innervation of muscle fiber bundles and the\nsites of bundle insertion, which are identified by characteristic patterns of\ncuticular coloration.\nMyogram electrodes were inserted into the distal anterior flexor tibiae\nmuscle bundle a11, a proximal flexor tibiae bundle (p1 to a2; [nomen-\nFigure 1. Experimental setup and example of locust scratching behavior. A, The locust was\ntethered with its hindleg standing on a support (black square), which determined the start\nposture. Stimulation at either ananterior or aposterior locationon thewing (triangles) initiated\na scratching movement. The hindleg performed a targeted movement in which the end of the\ntibiawas aimed at the stimulus location, followed by a cyclical component (trajectory shown as\na black line for a scratch aimed at the posterior target). In half of the trials, a load was placed at\nthe end of the tibia (circle). A three-dimensional optical motion capture system analyzed the\nlocations of six reflectivemarkers (crosses) and thusmeasured five joint angles (B) in each video\nframe. Joint angles\u0002 and\u0003 were 0 when the leg was in a plane parallel to the sagittal body\nplane. C, Synchronous electromyogramswere recorded of extensor (top channel, slow extensor\ntibiae, SETi) and flexor (bottom channels, proximal flexor, distal flexor) motor activity.

Motoneurons were identified\nusing standard criteria, including spike amplitudes, resistance reflex re-\nsponses to imposed movements of the tibia, and correlation of activity\nwith spontaneous movements (Field and Burrows, 1982; Burrows, 1995).\nIn each animal, we recorded at least one slow and one fast motoneuron\nfrom each site, amounting to at least 6 of 11 excitatory motoneurons\nknown to innervate the tibial muscles. Nine excitatory motoneurons\ninnervate the flexor tibiae muscle, each one innervating only a restricted\nsubset of muscle fibers. For example, the most proximal and distal fibers\nare innervated by nonoverlapping subsets of motoneurons (Sasaki and\nBurrows, 1998). Some fibers in the proximal bundles receive innervation\nfrom as many as seven of the nine excitatory motoneurons (Sasaki and\nBurrows, 1998). In addition to the nine excitatory motoneurons, the\ntibial flexor muscle is also innervated by two common inhibitor mo-\ntoneurons (Pearson, 1973; Hale and Burrows, 1985; Wolf, 1990), which\nwe did not record.\nThe metathoracic tibial extensor is 88% larger than the flexor (Bennet-\nClark, 1975). Its pennate muscle fibers are innervated by only four mo-\ntoneurons: the excitatory fast (FETi) and slow (SETi) extensor tibiae\nneurons, a common inhibitor (CI1) (Hoyle, 1955a,b; Usherwood and\nGrundfest, 1965), and a modulatory dorsal unpaired median neuron\n(Hoyle et al., 1974; Bra\u00a8unig and Pflu\u00a8ger, 2001). Individual muscle fibers\nare innervated in 1 of 12 neuron combinations (Hoyle, 1978). The fibers\nthemselves are classified as slow, intermediate, or fast based on their\nultrastructure and thus contractile properties (Hoyle, 1978). Fast fibers are\ninnervated by FETi only, whereas slow fibers are innervated by only SETi.\nIntermediate fibers are innervated by both FETi and SETi (Hoyle, 1978).\nElectromyogram (EMG) signals were amplified (1000\u0003) using stan-\ndard extracellular amplifiers and filtered with custom-built 50 Hz notch,\n500 Hz high-pass and 5 kHz low-pass filters. Signals were captured di-\nrectly to computer using a Cambridge Electronic Design 1401 interface\nand Spike 2 software (Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK).\nEMGs were displayed off-line using a software custom written in Matlab\n6.5 (MathWorks). Individual spikes were detected using a combination\nof adjustable thresholds and manual identification based on criteria de-\nscribed above. Slow and intermediate flexor motoneuron spikes on a\nsingle channel were treated as a single pool. For the proximal flexor site,\nwe classified only the spike with the largest amplitude as a fast flexor\nspike, although these muscle bundles should be innervated by two fast\nmotoneurons.\nOccasional crosstalk or artifacts were discounted manually by careful\ninspection of all recordings. SETi, FETi, and flexor motoneuron spikes\nwere then analyzed separately for each recording site. Different slow\nmotoneurons were recorded in both flexor channels, but they were active\nat approximately the same time. Only trials without fast motoneuron\n(FETi or fast flexor neurons) activity were used in the modeling described\nhere, which were 61% of all recorded trials.\nMuscle model and joint mechanics. The transformation of recorded\nmotoneuron spike trains into joint torque was modeled by including the\nmusculoskeletal properties, the apodeme (tendon) insertion points, and\nthe mechanics of the joint system. Each muscle was modeled as a se-\nquence of two functions: activation dynamics and muscle contraction.\nThe activation dynamics described the time course of isometric force\ngiven a certain spike train of motoneuron action potentials. In particular,\nit transformed a sequence of action potentials, \u0004(t), into a continuous\nactive state of the muscle, \u0005(t), which may be interpreted as the number\nof actin\u2013myosin bridges. Function \u0004(t) was 0, except for brief periods\nwhen an action potential occurred, when it resembled a half sine wave\nwith a width of 1 ms, as proposed by van Zandwijk et al. (1996). Activa-\ntion dynamics were modeled by two coupled overcritically damped dif-\nferential equations (Eqs. 1, 2) based on Hatze (1977) and J. Zakotnik and\nL. Blackburn (unpublished observations).\n\u00062\u0007\n\u0006t2\n\b \t1\n\u0006\u0007\n\u0006t\n\b \t2\u0007 \n \u0004\u0004t\u0005\n\u00062\u0005\n\u0006t2\n\b \t3\n\u0006\u0005\n\u0006t\n\b c\u0004 f \u0005\t4\u0005 \n \u0007\u0004t\u0005. (1)\n\u0007(t) can be interpreted as the time course of the muscle fiber membrane\npotential.\nA force potentiation factor c( f ) was introduced to model calcium-\ndependent facilitation. It depended on the instant spike frequency f and\nincreased the force for spike frequencies around 20 Hz. It was defined as\na Michaelis\u2013Menten-type equation:\nc\u0004t\u0005 \n\nt2\nK1 \b t\n2 \u000b\nt2\nK2 \b t\n2 \b 1; t \n 1\/f. (2)\nActivation dynamics therefore contained six parameters (\t1\u2013\t4 and K1\u2013\nK2), as determined by previous experiments done by Zakotnik and Black-\nburn (unpublished observations). These parameters were kept constant\nin the present study. Parameters \t1\u2013\t4 and K1\u2013K2 were derived from\nmean parameter values of a model for isometric force production on the\nextensor muscle when stimulated by the slow motoneuron SETi (Zakot-\nnik, 2006). The values were \t1 \u0002 79, \t2 \u0002 2783, \t3 \u0002 4919, \t4 \u0002 78582,\nK1\u0002 1.46\u0003 10\n\u00062, and K2\u0002 3.9\u0003 10\n\u00064. Using these parameters, a single\ntwitch had a rising time of 54 ms and an exponential decay time of 110 ms\nto half of peak twitch force. Although these parameter set was not opti-\nmized on force measurements of flexor muscle, flexor activation dynam-\nics measured by Phillips (1980) suggest that flexor parameters should be\nvery similar to extensor parameters.\nTo account for the slow muscle dynamics, muscle activation was cal-\nculated 100 ms before the scratching movement, which began when the\nlocust first moved its tarsus off the foot rest. In addition, the active state\n\u0005 in Equation 1 was scaled by 8.15\u0003 10\u00065 so that an isometric force of 20\nmN corresponded to a stimulation frequency of 50 Hz, as measured by\nBlackburn (2005). The parameter set used for Equations 1 and 2 was also\nused for the flexor muscle, but the scaling factor was adjusted to account\nfor lower measured flexor force. For both muscles, the maximum isomet-\nric force could be adjusted by the optimization procedure (see below).\nActivation dynamics were calculated separately for spike trains from the\nthree recording sites, so the distal and proximal flexor recordings yielded\ntwo separate time courses, which were then averaged to obtain overall\nflexor active state \u0005f.\nExtensor force Fe and flexor force Ff were obtained from the muscle\nactive states \u0005e and \u0005f and a passive force component arising from a\nparallel elastic element. The active force component was obtained by\nscaling the active state by the maximum isometric force F\u02c6 and by two\nmuscle characteristics that depend on relative muscle length l and muscle\nshortening velocity \u0006v (Zajac, 1989):\nExtensor, Fe \n\n\u0005e \f F\u02c6e \f V\u0004ve\u0005\f L\u0004le\u0005\u00c7\n\b\nactive\nP\u0004le\u0005\u00c7\npassive (3)\nFlexor, Ff \n \u0005f \f F\u02c6f \f V\u0004vf\u0005\f L\u0004lf\u0005\n\u00c8 \b P\u0004lf\u0005\n\u00c8. (4)\nIn Equation 3, function L denotes the force\u2013length (FL) characteristic,\nfunction V is the force\u2013velocity (FV) characteristic, and function P is the\npassive force. Relative extensor length le and flexor length lf were set\naccording to the standard muscle model proposed by Zajac (1989) to be\n1 at an FT joint angle of 90\u00b0, 0.5 for 0\u00b0, and 1.5 for 180\u00b0. The maximum\njoint angle range of the FL relationship served as an approximation for an\naverage muscle fiber, because the true muscle fiber lengths for different\njoint angles are not known and may be heterogeneous in different parts of\nthe muscle (Hoyle, 1955a). For intermediate angles, the muscle length\nwas derived separately for extensor and flexor from the geometry of the\nFT joint (Heitler, 1974), as described later in Materials and Methods\n(Eqs. 12, 13).\nThe FL characteristic L reduced muscle force for extreme muscle\nlengths. It was a Gaussian-type function as used by Geyer et al. (2003),\nwith adjustable width w:\nL\u0004l, w\u0005\n exp\u0007w\f \u0001l\u000b 1\u00013\b. (5)\nDuring optimization, parameter w determined the decay of active force\nfor muscle lengths beyond the resting position. The FV characteristic V\nZakotnik et al. \u2022 Passive Forces in Load Compensation J. Neurosci., May 10, 2006 \u2022 26(19):4995\u20135007 \u2022 4997\nwas a sigmoid function scaled to the interval [0;2] with parameter s,\nwhich controlled its slope:\nV\u0004v, s\u0005\n 1\b tanh\u0004s\f v\u0005. (6)\nThe tanh function approximated the original function described by Hill\n(1953) but had only one parameter controlling its slope in contrast to two\nlumped hyperbolas in Hill\u2019s model. The tanh function in Equation 6\nbehaves essentially like the pair of Hill parabolas in that a quickly con-\ntracting muscle does not produce any force, whereas a lengthening mus-\ncle could maximally double the maximum isometric force (compared\nwith a factor of 1.8 used by Zajac, 1989). During optimization, parameter s\ndetermined the decay of force during contraction. The passive force P of the\nmusculotendon system was implemented as a cubic parabola controlled by a\nscaling parameter p, depending on muscle length l (Eq. 7). The cubic parab-\nola resembles the passive force function used by Zajac (1989):\nP\u0004l, p\u0005 \n \u0002 p \f \u0004l \u000b 1\u00053 , l \r 10 otherwise. (7)\nDuring optimization, parameter p was varied to set the relative contri-\nbution of passive elastic force to total muscle force production.\nTo calculate the joint torque \u000e, extensor force Fe and flexor force Ff\nwere multiplied by their moment arms Me and Mf, which depended on\nthe FT angle \u0005:\n\u000e \n Fe \f Me\u0004\u0005\u0005 \u000b Ff \f Mf\u0004\u0005\u0005. (8)\nMoment arms were given by the geometry of the joint and the attach-\nment points of the apodemes. The relationship between joint angle and\nmoment arm (Eqs. 9, 10) was derived from Heitler (1974), their Figures\n1 and 2, and geometrical relationships described for the FT joint by Field\nand Coles (1994), their Appendix. The extensor moment arm Me\nchanged approximately sinusoidally with the joint angle, whereas the\nflexor moment arm Mf was more complex, because the apodeme was\nredirected over Heitler\u2019s lump and the tibia was bent at the insertion\npoint. The flexor moment arm was largest for flexed positions and de-\ncreased monotonically at larger joint angles:\nMe \n 0.76 \f 10\n\u00063 \f sin\u0004179\t\u000b \u0005\u0005 \u0007m\b (9)\nMf \n 1.67 \f 10\n\u00063 \f sin\u0003\u000612\n\u0004 \u0007m\b (10)\n\n \n \u0005 \b 26\t \b atan\n\u0004a\u000b b\u0005\f cot\n\u0005 \u000b 154\t\n2\na\b b\n. (11)\nIn this model, the flexor moment arm Mf would become negative for\njoint angles larger than 154\u00b0, because the apodeme remains redirected\nover the lump, despite the fact that this is not the case in the animal.\nNevertheless, the model was appropriate for the present study because all\nmeasured FT joint angles were lower than 122\u00b0.\nThe geometry was also used for the calculation of relative muscle\nlength depending on the FT angle \u0005:\nle \n 1 \b\ncos\u0004179\t\u000b \u0005\u0005\n2\n(12)\nlf \n\n\u00056.79 \b 6.68 \f cos\u0004\u0005 \u000b 154\t\u0005\u000b 0.89\n2.78\n\b\n1\n2\n.

Therefore, the net torque \u000en was given by the\ntorque \u000e produced by muscles and a velocity-dependent damping with\nproportionality factor d:\n\u000en \n \u000e \u000b d \f \u0005\u02d9. (14)\nThe net torque \u000en was the torque that actuates the FT joint in the forward\ndynamics simulation.\nDynamics model and simulation. To derive the FT joint movement\ngiven the calculated FT torque and movement of the other joints and\nsegments, a three-dimensional forward dynamics simulation was imple-\nmented using Newton\u2013Euler equations (Spong and Vidyasagar, 1989).\nIn the simulation, the FT joint was actuated by the torques obtained by\nthe muscle model (Fig. 2) and moment arms, whereas the other joints\nwere moved passively to reflect exactly the recorded joint angle time\ncourses during each scratch. This allowed us to consider torques induced\nby passive FT joint and tibia segment movement attributable to proximal\nsegment movement and gravity.\nThe simulation was implemented using Matlab Simulink (Math-\nWorks), which uses a variable-step Runge\u2013Kutta integrator (ode45) to\nintegrate joint angles from calculated joint accelerations. On a 3 GHz\nPentium IV computer, the model calculated \u00010.8 simulation seconds\nper real-time second. Time courses of the FT joint in the simulation were\nsampled at 5 kHz, and the recorded movement of proximal joints was\ninterpolated from 50 Hz to 5 kHz. In addition to the kinematic model\ndescribed in the previous section, the simulation also incorporated the\nmass of the tibia and its inertia tensor. Segment masses and lengths were\nmeasured and set for each animal model separately. The mean value for\nall tibia masses was 14.9 mg (SD of 2.3 mg) and for all lengths 22.8 mm\n(SD of 0.63 mm). The inertia tensor was that of a homogenous cylinder\nwith radius 0.5 mm. When modeling loaded experiments, a simulated\nweight of 142 mg was added to the tibia inertia tensor, using Steiner\u2019s\ntheorem. The weight was modeled as a cylinder with a length of 2 mm and\na radius of 0.5 mm placed at the distal end of the tibia and in its center.\nOptimization protocol for model variants. Up to six model parameters\nwere optimized with respect to the least-squares error between the sim-\nulated and the recorded FT joint angle time courses of each trial. The\ncomplexity of the five model variants was increased cumulatively, as\ndepicted in Figure 2. The simplest model variant 1 scaled maximum\nisometric extensor and flexor force separately; thus, it contained two\nparameters. This variant assumed that the isometric muscle force acted\nlinearly on the moment arms, which transform force into joint torque.\nThe second model variant 2 additionally comprised a viscous joint\ndamping component (Eq. 14), in which a joint torque was subtracted\nFigure 2. Scheme of the biomechanical model used to simulate locust scratching move-\nments. Numbers indicate the order in which the components of the model were included, thus\nincreasing its complexity in steps. The neuronal input consisted of slow motoneuron action\npotentials (SETi and slow flexor), which were transformed into the active state of the muscle\nusing activation dynamics. The active state was scaled by the maximal possible isometric force\nand modified by passive elasticity, force\u2013velocity, and force\u2013length properties of the muscle.\nMuscle forcewas transformed into FT joint torquebymoment armsgivenby the joint geometry.\nA joint damping component reduced the torque, depending on joint velocity. Tibial movement\nwas calculated from joint torque using a forward dynamics algorithm. Co-contraction occurs\nwhen both antagonistic muscle models produce a nonzero torque.\n4998 \u2022 J. Neurosci., May 10, 2006 \u2022 26(19):4995\u20135007 Zakotnik et al. \u2022 Passive Forces in Load Compensation\nfrom the sum of antagonistic torques (three parameters total). This vari-\nant assumed a linear transform from isometric into isotonic muscle force\nbut included an opposing velocity-dependent frictional torque. The\nthird model variant 3 included a passive elastic force (Eq. 7) with a\ncommon parameter for both muscles (four parameters). This variant\nthus took into account a passive elastic property of both muscles, render-\ning the musculoskeletal system into a passive spring-and-damper system.\nThe fourth model variant 4 included an FV characteristic (Eq. 6) for both\nmuscles with a common slope parameter (five parameters). Variant 4\ntherefore included an active damping property of the contractile ele-\nment, which was not present in variant 3. The fifth variant 5 contained an\nFL characteristic (Eq. 5) that modulated the force production depending\non muscle length (six parameters). Thus, variant 5 included an active-\nspring property of the contractile element. Other model variants were\ntested as controls as indicated in the corresponding sections in Results.\nOptimization was performed using a bounded Levenberg\u2013Marquardt\nalgorithm implemented in Matlab (lsqnonlin). To prevent the algorithm\nfrom converging to local minima of the error function, the optimization\nwas restarted with random values at least 60 times. The numerical\nbounds within which parameters were initialized and could vary by were\ndetermined such that the range of solutions was not limited by these\nbounds (Table 1). We used measured values as an estimate when avail-\nable. These estimates were used to limit the range in which parameters\nwere initialized: maximum isometric extensor force with SETi stimula-\ntion at 50 Hz was measured by Blackburn (2005) and set to F\u02c6e \u0002 20 mN.\nBecause the measurements were done at a joint angle of 140\u00b0, the true\nvalue of the model parameter F\u02c6e is likely to be larger. For the flexor\nmuscle, the same range was assumed, although the muscle is weaker than\nthe extensor. However, not all motoneurons were recorded; therefore, an\nincreased isometric muscle force could compensate for a lack in recorded\nneural activation.\nMeasurements of joint viscosity are not available for the FT joint, so we\nreferred to an experiment on cockroach leg performed by Garcia et al.\n(2000), in which the cut leg was moved in a pendulum-like oscillation.\nWe chose the initial damping parameter such that it produced a qualita-\ntively similar damped motion of the simulated locust leg. To account for\nthe different animals and leg mass in our study, the range of possible\ninitial values was set to a large interval (Table 1).\nPassive torques in the FT joint were measured by Burrows and Hor-\nridge (1974) for one animal, allowing us to use the joint geometry to\ncalculate passive forces in each muscle and to fit one model cubic parab-\nola to both the extensor and flexor muscles, giving a mean parameter\nvalue of p \u0002 0.7.\nMeasurements of the FL- and FV-function parameters are not avail-\nable, so their values were set to qualitatively resemble the standard mus-\ncle model proposed by Zajac (1989) and their parameters could vary\nacross a large interval during optimization.\nResults\nMotor patterns driving scratching movements\nScratching behavior consisted of a targeted movement toward the\nstimulus position followed by one or more cyclical movements\nnear the stimulus position (Fig. 1) (Du\u00a8rr and Matheson, 2003).\nThe targeting movement lasted 100 \u2013200 ms and consisted of a\nlevation of the femur and extension of the tibia. The cyclical\nmovement typically included both extensions and flexions of the\ntibia. During scratching, the FT joint could move from a maxi-\nmum flexion of 12.9\u00b0 to a maximum extension of 121.2\u00b0, with a\nmedian joint angle of 58.3\u00b0. Femur\u2013tibia joint angles depended\non the stimulus position. For the anterior stimulus position, the\ntibia was mostly flexed (49.2\u00b0; IQR of 26.6\u00b0), whereas posterior\nscratches resulted in a more extended tibia (82.4\u00b0; IQR of 32.2\u00b0).\nWhen the leg was loaded, movement patterns remained indistin-\nguishable from unloaded movements, as judged from the direc-\ntion and velocity of the initial targeting movement and the veloc-\nity, number of loops, and area covered by the cyclic part of the\nmovement (Matheson and Du\u00a8rr, 2003).\nBecause trials with fast motoneurons were excluded, tibial\nmovements were driven only by SETi and slow flexor motoneu-\nron activity. Each scratch contained three (IQR of 2) SETi bursts,\nwith a median instantaneous spike frequency of 57 spikes per\nsecond (sp\/s) (IQR of 36 sp\/s), three (IQR of 4) proximal slow\nflexor bursts with a spike frequency of 75 sp\/s (IQR of 68 sp\/s),\nand one (IQR of 4) distal slow flexor bursts with a frequency of 66\nsp\/s (IQR of 69 sp\/s). Although spike frequencies were higher\nthan the rate required for maximal muscle activation [50 sp\/s\n(Hoyle, 1978)], bursts typically contained fewer spikes than nec-\nessary for full activation of the muscle. In some cases, even single\nspikes occurred, which could be interleaved between bursts of an\nantagonistic neuron. There was no overlap between bursts of\nantagonistic motoneurons. In loaded trials, burst duration and\nspike frequency increased in extensor motoneurons, whereas\nboth of these variables decreased in flexor motoneurons. As in\nunloaded trials, bursts of antagonistic motoneurons did not\noverlap in loaded trials (J. Zakotnik, K. L. Page, T. Matheson, and\nV. Du\u00a8rr, unpublished observations).\nDynamics of recorded scratches\nMedian net FT joint torque during unloaded scratches was 1.1\n\u0001Nm (IQR of 0.7 \u0001Nm), which was calculated using inverse\ndynamics. To compensate for gravity, almost all postures (97%)\nrequired positive torque at the FT joint, i.e., torque driving tibial\nextension. In loaded scratches, the mean FT torque increased\n16-fold to 17.0 \u0001Nm (IQR of 12.6 \u0001Nm) to generate the move-\nment with a mass attached to the tibia. Femur\u2013tibia joint torque\nwas also influenced by interaction torques caused by the motion\nof more basal segments, which give rise to centripetal and coriolis\nforces. For example, fast levation of the femur at the thoraco-\ncoxal or coxo-trochanteral joints could cause a negative torque in\nthe FT joint, resulting in a passive flexion of the tibia. To quantify\nthe passive FT torque generated by body, coxa, and femur move-\nment only, inverse dynamics were calculated in the absence of\ngravity and tibial acceleration. The mean absolute interaction\ntorque for an unloaded tibia was \u00064.1 \u0003 10\u00063 \u0001Nm (IQR of\n3.2 \u0003 10\u00062 \u0001Nm), which amounted to only 0.4% of the net\ntorque. Even for loaded trials, interaction torque amounted to\nonly 1.1% of the net torque (\u00060.2 \u0001Nm; IQR of 0.9 \u0001Nm).\nBehavior simulation using biomechanical models\nTo determine the minimal model configuration sufficient for\nsimulating scratching behavior, time courses of FT joint angle\nwere generated using biomechanical model variants of increasing\ncomplexity (see Materials and Methods) (Fig. 2). In each new\nmodel variant, all parameters were reoptimized, regardless of\nwhether they had been optimized in a previous model variant.\nOne typical recorded time course is shown in Figure 3 together\nwith time courses simulated by different versions of our biome-\nchanical model. The error statistics for all 80 recorded and sim-\nulated trials are shown in Figure 4.\nTable 1.

Neurosci., May 10, 2006 \u2022 26(19):4995\u20135007 \u2022 4999\nThe most simple model variant 1 using\nonly activation-dependent extensor and\nflexor forces moved the tibia between ex-\ntremely extended and flexed positions and,\ntherefore, could not reproduce the re-\ncorded movements (Fig. 4). For this\nmodel, the median of root mean squared\nerror (RMSE) for trials in both loading\nconditions was 30.9\u00b0 (IQR of 13.3\u00b0). Addi-\ntion of a passive damping (PD) compo-\nnent (model variant 2) decreased tibial ve-\nlocity and reduced the median RMSE to\n18.9\u00b0 (IQR of 8.9\u00b0). However, model 2\ncould not generate fast movements like the\ncyclic component of scratching behavior\n(Fig. 3A). When a passive elasticity (PE)\ncomponent was added (model variant 3),\nthere was a good fit between simulated and\nrecorded joint angle time courses (Fig.\n3B). The median RMSE was reduced to\n5.3\u00b0 (IQR of 3.4\u00b0), which was the lowest\nerror of all models analyzed. The error ap-\npeared to be lower when simulating an un-\nloaded leg (4.7\u00b0) than when a load was\nadded (6.1\u00b0), but this difference was not\nsignificant (one-way ANOVA; F(40,40) \u0002\n3.02; p \u0002 0.09). Also, there was no signifi-\ncant difference between model perfor-\nmance for trials with anterior and poste-\nrior stimulus positions (one-way ANOVA;\nF(40,40) \u0002 0.85; p \u0002 0.34).\nIncorporating FV and FL characteristics\ninto the model (variants 4 and 5) did not\nfurther reduce the median error (FV, me-\ndian of 6.3\u00b0, IQR of 4.0\u00b0; FL, median of 5.7\u00b0,\nIQR of 3.7\u00b0). Neither error was significantly\ndifferent from the error of model variant 3\nthat lacked these active muscle properties\n(one-way ANOVAs; FV, F(80,80)\u0002 3.27, p\u0002\n0.07; FL, F(80,80) \u0002 2.02, p\u0002 0.16). Example\ntime courses for model variants 4 and 5 are\nshown in Figure 3, C and D. An initial exten-\nsion of the tibia in Figure 3D was attributable\nto the scaling property of the FL characteris-\ntic, which strongly reduces flexor force during the initial phase of the\ntrial because muscle length is very short in this flexed position. At the\nsame time, passive elasticity of the extensor causes a positive net\ntorque at the joint. The same effect is also seen in Figure 3F.\nThese results, summarized in Figure 4, showed that elastic and\ndamping properties of the musculoskeletal system significantly\nimproved the model performance but that additional active elas-\nticity and damping did not improve performance. To test\nwhether the passive properties could be replaced by the corre-\nsponding characteristic of the active contractile element, we re-\nmoved either the PD or PE component from model variant 5. If\nPD was removed, the RMSE increased significantly (one-way\nANOVA; F(80,80) \u0002 20.57; p \u000b 0.01) to 7.9\u00b0 (IQR of 4.6\u00b0), shown\nin Figure 3F. It extended too rapidly from flexed positions, which\nresulted in a large error in the initial targeting movement and\novershot at the turning points of the cyclical movement. In addi-\ntion, a phase shift between recorded and simulated time course\nwas observed in many trials (e.g., after t \u0002 1.8 s in Fig. 3F).\nWithout the PE (Fig. 3E), the tibia did not return from extremely\nflexed or extended positions in two trials and was therefore not\noptimized systematically for all other trials.\nParameters of optimized models\nA separate set of optimized model parameters was determined for\neach trial, so we could evaluate the parameter variability for dif-\nferent loading conditions and model complexity. Because all\nmodel parameters are thought to be constants of the musculo-\nskeletal system, they should not vary with the experimental vari-\nables stimulus position and load. Rather, the optimization pro-\ncedure should find one global optimum for each animal.\nFurthermore, because all parameters were initialized at random\nbefore optimization, small variability in a particular optimized\nparameter indicates that this value is important for movement\ngeneration. Such random initialization would cause unimportant\nparameters to be optimized to different arbitrary values for each\ndifferent movement.\nThe median parameter values and 10,90 percentiles for each\nmodel are shown in Table 2. These overall medians are also sub-\ndivided into separate values derived from loaded and unloaded\nFigure 3.

In F, the PD was removed from the model with all properties (RMSE of 11.1\u00b0).\n5000 \u2022 J.

On average, the\nparameter variation (determined by 10,90 percentiles) was 59%\nof the median values for all parameters and model configura-\ntions. In model variant 2 that included passive elasticity, the\nflexor force F\u02c6f was optimized to the lower bound of its range in\nmost trials (Table 2). Nevertheless, lowering the boundary did\nnot improve the joint angle RMSE, indicating that optimization\nattempted to minimize flexor force in this model.\nIn model variant 3, which comprised both passive compo-\nnents (PD and PE) and had the best performance, the maximum\nisometric forces were 55 mN for the extensor muscle and 42 mN\nfor the flexor muscle. Addition of the FV characteristic in model\nvariant 4 reduced the flexor force significantly to 33 mN (one-\nway ANOVA; F(80,80)\u0002 7.78; p\u0002 0.006), suggesting that velocity-\ndependent force reduction affected the flexor more than the ex-\ntensor. Moreover, the variability of the extensor and flexor\nmaximum isometric force decreased significantly when the FV\nproperty was included (Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test with median-\ncentered distributions, p \u000b 0.02). At the same time, the median\njoint damping coefficient d was reduced from 0.6 to 0.4 (Table 2),\nwhich indicated that the FV characteristic accounted for part of\nthe total joint damping that was necessary to achieve a good\nmodel fit. Including both active components (FV and FL charac-\nteristics) in model variant 5 confirmed the low flexor force of the\nprevious model variant. The apparent reduction of the FV pa-\nrameter was not statistically significant.\nThe characteristics of the optimized model variant 5 are\nshown in Figure 5. In general, the variance of all model parame-\nters indicated that particular features in the joint angle time\ncourse led to strong modification of individual parameters. The\nshape of the active FL and FV characteristics (Fig. 5C,D) appeared\nto be affected more than the passive characteristics (Fig. 5A,B).\nThe extreme cases of the FV characteristic range from a nearly\nlinear solution to a nearly discrete switch from factor 0 to factor 2.\nIn all model variants that included PD and PE (models 3\u20135),\nmuscle parameters did not change significantly with load, except\nfor maximum extensor force, which was larger for loaded trials in\nall model variants (Table 2) (one-way ANOVA, p \u000b 0.01, sepa-\nrately for each model variant). For example, the maximum ex-\ntensor force for the model variant 3 including only PD and PE\nwas 23% larger in loaded conditions than in unloaded\nconditions.\nGeneralization capability and parameter sensitivity of\nthe model\nHaving determined the parameter ranges for each model variant,\nit was necessary to evaluate how well each particular solution\ngeneralized to all other recorded trials. A sensitivity analysis was\nused to determine the extent to which variation of a particular\nsolution affected model performance.\nThe ability of the model to generalize across trials within one\nanimal was evaluated by generating a standard model with a me-\ndian parameter set from all trials except for one test trial. The test\ntrial was simulated using the standard model and compared with\nthe recorded FT joint angle time course for the same trial. This\nprocedure was repeated for each trial, rendering the number of\nevaluated trials n \u0002 80.\nThe error generated by the standard model on the single test\ntrial decreased with increasing model complexity (Fig. 6, white\nboxes) in a pattern that was similar to the trend for individually\noptimized trials (compare with Fig. 4). Median generalization\nerrors were above 25\u00b0 in model variants 1 and 2 and approxi-\nmately halved with the introduction of passive damping. Accord-\ningly, the model variant 3 with PD and PE had a median RMSE of\n13.1\u00b0 (IQR of 8.0\u00b0). To illustrate the performance of this model\nvariant, the inset in Figure 6 shows a representative trial (com-\npare with Fig. 3). The generalization error was significantly larger\nfor loaded trials than for unloaded trials (one-way ANOVA;\nF(40,40) \u0002 6.4; p \u0002 0.01), indicating that the model did not gen-\neralize well across load conditions. This reflected the significant\ndifference in extensor force (unloaded, 50 mN; loaded, 61 mN)\nTable 2.

RMSE for different muscle model variants (increasing from left to right), divided\ninto40unloaded (openboxes) and40 loaded (grayboxes) trials for five animals.

Using only\nextensor and flexor forces resulted in oscillatory movements and therefore created the largest\nRMSE of all models (column \u201cforce\u201d). PD reduced the error, but a PE component decreased the\nerror further, because it returned the tibia from extreme positions to the resting position.\nAddition of a force\u2013velocity (FV) and force\u2013length (FL) property did not reduce the error.\nZakotnik et al. \u2022 Passive Forces in Load Compensation J. Neurosci., May 10, 2006 \u2022 26(19):4995\u20135007 \u2022 5001\n(Table 2). Addition of the FV property in model variant 4 caused\na nonsignificant reduction in the RMSE to 12.0\u00b0 (IQR of 5.9\u00b0) and\nabolished the significant difference between loaded and unloaded\ntrials (one-way ANOVA; F(40,40) \u0002 0.3; p \u0002 0.68). This suggests\nthat the segmentation of damping into an active and a passive\ncomponent improves generalization. An additional FL property\ncaused a nonsignificant increase in the error to 12.2\u00b0 (IQR of\n6.6\u00b0). Application of a standard model to new trials of the same\nanimal increased the overall error by 6.7\u00b0 on average compared\nwith models optimized to a single trial. As for individually opti-\nmized trials (compare with Fig. 4), there was no significant dif-\nference between generalization errors for different stimulus po-\nsitions in any model variant (one-way ANOVA, all p \f 0.1).\nTo assess how sensitive the models were with regard to varia-\ntion of the optimized parameters, we took the extreme values\nproduced by the optimization procedure and determined the er-\nror between each recorded trial and a simulation calculated using\nthe extreme values. In each model variant, extreme values were\nset for the parameter of interest, whereas the other parameters\nwere set to their median values. The results are shown next to the\ngeneralization errors in Figure 6 (gray boxes). Parameter varia-\ntion caused significant differences only in model variants 2 (one-\nway ANOVA; F(80,160) \u0002 22.4; p \u000b 0.001) and 3 (one-way\nANOVA; F(80,160)\u0002 10.0; p\u0002 0.0018). This highlights the impor-\ntance of passive damping and passive elasticity for appropriate\nmodeling of movement.\nRole of musculoskeletal model components\nTo assess the relative contributions of passive and active elements\nof the model, the net torque computed for each trial was decom-\nposed into the torques generated by (1) the active contractile\nelements of the two antagonists (isometric forces, scaled by FV\nand FL), (2) parallel passive elasticity of each muscles, and (3)\npassive damping at the joint (for model structure, see Fig. 2). This\nanalysis was performed on model variant 3 that included PD and\nPE and on variant 5 that included all components. Active force\nproduction in variant 3 is equivalent to the isometric force, but\nvariant 5 incorporates both isometric and isotonic forces. The\nrelative contribution of passive and active components is quali-\ntatively similar in both of these model variants, so we illustrate the\nresults for only model variant 5 because it includes all known\nmuscle characteristics (Zajac, 1989).\nTypical torque time courses for a leg in unloaded and loaded\ncondition are shown in Figure 7. The torques generated by the\nextensor and flexor muscles (Fig. 7Aii,Bii, thin lines) and by joint\ndamping (Fig. 7Aii,Bii, dotted lines) were large compared with\nthe effective net torque acting at the FT joint (Fig. 7Aii,Bii). This\nwas because most of the muscle-generated torque was absorbed\nby the antagonistic muscle and joint damping; thus, co-\ncontraction of antagonistic muscles causes significant stiffness of\nthe limb. During extensions, the extensor produced 53.0% (IQR\nof 13.9%) of the total torque, counteracted by flexor contraction\n(32.6%; IQR of 21.3%) and joint damping (6.5%; IQR of 13.7%).\nDuring flexions, flexor muscle produced 49.9% (IQR of 12.6%)\nof the total torque, counteracted by extensor contraction (47.3%;\nIQR of 12.5%) and damping (4.5%; IQR of 7.1%). The mean net\ntorque was often positive (extension) even if the tibia was flexing,\nbecause the tibia needed to be lifted against gravity.\nContribution of active and passive\nmusculoskeletal properties\nIn the absence of external forces, passive muscle force (PE)\nmoved the tibia toward a resting position of 70.9\u00b0. Although the\nPE is modeled as a cubic parabola for each of the antagonistic\nmuscles, the overall passive joint torque depended approximately\nlinearly on the FT joint angle. In other words, the joint behaved\nalmost like a linear spring over most of the working range (Fig. 8).\nThis linearization is attributable to the matched action of the\nantagonist muscles and their moment arms, both of which are\nnonlinear within the working range. The spring constant of the\nmodel was \u00060.98 \u0001Nm\/\u00b0. This means that, for extreme joint\nangles, passive torques may reach 54 \u0001Nm, which is sufficient to\nlift even a loaded tibia without any motoneuron activity.\nThe relative proportions of torque generated by active muscle\nFigure 5.

Inset, The sample\ntrajectory (RMSE of 13.0\u00b0) was generated using the average optimum of model variant 3 with\npassive damping and passive elasticity, which was the best model for individually optimized\ntrials.\n5002 \u2022 J. Neurosci., May 10, 2006 \u2022 26(19):4995\u20135007 Zakotnik et al. \u2022 Passive Forces in Load Compensation\ncontraction and passive elasticity were strongly dependent on the\nstimulus position and the corresponding movement (Fig. 9). For\nmovements aimed at the anterior stimulus, flexor forces were\npredominantly active (Fig. 9, black bars, anterior), because the FT\njoint was generally working in a range that was more flexed than\nthe resting position. In other words, to keep the joint flexed re-\nquired active flexion to counter the passive tendency to return the\njoint to the resting position. In contrast, for movements aimed at\nthe posterior stimulus, which required operating the joint at an-\ngles more extended than rest, it was the extensor muscle that had\nto generate active force (Fig. 9, black bars, posterior). For exam-\nple, the passive extensor torque for anterior stimulus positions\nand an unloaded extending tibia was 12-fold larger than the ac-\ntive extensor torque (median passive, 21.8 \u0001Nm; median active,\n1.8 \u0001Nm). The extensor torque was opposed by active flexor\ntorque, which, for these anterior stimuli,\nwas larger than the active extensor torque\nfor both extension and flexion move-\nments. The flexor muscle therefore ac-\ntively counteracted the extensor PE in\nflexed positions and was active not only\nduring flexions but also during extensions\n(Fig. 9). A corollary of this is that there\nshould be little motor drive to the extensor\nmuscle during extensions from the most\nflexed joint angles. This was borne out in\nour experiments, in which some exten-\nsions were generated without or with very\nlittle SETi activity (data not shown), much\nlike what has been described previously by\nBerkowitz and Laurent (1996).\nDuring unloaded posterior stimulus\ntrials and a flexing tibia, the flexor active\ntorque was low compared with the flexor\nPE torque, because the tibia was more ex-\ntended and therefore the flexor muscle\nstretched (median passive, 20.3\u0001Nm; me-\ndian active, 2.8 \u0001Nm). In this case, active\nextensor torque was larger than the active\nflexor torque in extensions and flexions\nalike, indicating that a large part of flexions was attributable to\npassive flexor force (PE) and gravity.\nTo determine the time course of active and passive torques\nduring the control of extensions, we evaluated 90 extensions that\nhad a mean velocity of \f100\u00b0\/s and a duration of at least 160 ms\n(Fig. 10). This excluded short oscillating tibial movements. Dur-\ning first half of the extension when the FT joint was flexed (30.0\u00b0;\nIQR of 16.3\u00b0), passive torque was larger than actively generated\ntorque. After 80 ms, active torque exceeded passive torque, be-\ncause the leg was in a more extended position (54.0\u00b0; IQR of\n26.3\u00b0). The total torque produced during these extensions was\napproximately constant in the model. This shows that passive\nforces tend to initiate extensions.\nCo-contraction and load compensation\nTo extend a loaded tibia, locusts increased net joint torque by\n\f16-fold (1627%), as calculated by inverse dynamics. In con-\ntrast, the average extensor burst for a loaded tibia generated only\n\u000150% more force, which can be derived from isometric force\nattributable to muscle activation dynamics. To examine this dis-\ncrepancy, Figure 11 shows which components of the model con-\ntribute to the torque increase during extensions.\nIn loaded trials, the maximum extensor force parameter was\nincreased by 22% and the level of co-contraction decreased (Fig.\n11). In unloaded trials, the extensor muscle produced 26.3 \u0001Nm\n(IQR of 16.1\u0001Nm) and the flexor 25.2\u0001Nm (IQR of 15.8\u0001Nm).\nThe net torque, i.e., the difference between extensor and flexor\ntorque, that was necessary to extend the unloaded tibia was only\n1.1 \u0001Nm (IQR of 0.6 \u0001Nm). Therefore, the extensor produced a\ntorque 24-fold larger than what would have been necessary with-\nout flexor co-contraction and joint damping. The observed\n1627% change in net torque to 18.4 \u0001Nm could also be achieved\nby a symmetrical 32.2% increase in extensor torque and 32.2%\ndecrease in flexor torque. This illustrates how large co-\ncontraction levels increase the dynamic range of the joint torque,\nbecause a small change in muscle force can cause a strong increase\nin net torque. Generally, the larger the torques produced by co-\ncontraction of extensor and flexor (\u000ee, \u000ef), the less is the relative\nFigure 7. Two sample trials (Ai, Aii, unloaded tibia; Bi, Bii, loaded tibia) with the net torque (bold solid line in Aii, Bii)\ndecomposed into the separate torques generated by the extensor (top thin line) and flexor (bottom thin line) muscles, respec-\ntively. The bold dotted line shows the torque attributable to passive joint damping. The simulated time courses of the FT joint\nangle are shown inAi andBi. Because of co-contraction of bothmuscles and joint damping, the net torque in the unloaded trial is\n28-fold lower than theaveragemuscle-produced torqueand thuswasnear the0axis. In the loaded trial, net torque is only 1.8-fold\nlower.\nFigure 8. Passive elasticity of antagonistic muscles depending on the FT joint angle. Al-\nthough thepassive force ismodeledas a cubic paraboladependingonmuscle length, becauseof\nthemomentarms, the resulting torque resembles a linear torque springwith respect to the joint\nangle. Its maximum absolute torques reach 54\u0001Nm in the model.\nZakotnik et al. \u2022 Passive Forces in Load Compensation J.

(15)\nAs one of the muscles decreases its force, co-contraction also\ndecreases during loading. In our experiments, SETi activity in-\ncreased by 30.6% and slow flexor activity is decreased by 25.6%\nwhen the tibia was loaded.\nDiscussion\nMotor control of aimed limb movements involves the biome-\nchanical transformation of a motoneuronal signal into move-\nment. By modeling this transformation for aimed scratching\nmovements in the locust (Berkowitz and Laurent, 1996; Du\u00a8rr and\nMatheson, 2003; Matheson and Du\u00a8rr, 2003), we show that the\ndynamic range of joint torques is increased by co-contraction.\nPassive properties of the musculoskeletal system cause large joint\nstiffness in this invertebrate model system. Both effects facilitate\nload compensation.\nWe first evaluated the necessary model complexity (Figs. 2\u2013 6)\nand then the relative importance of passive and active properties\n(Figs. 7\u201311). The minimal model that can simulate the limb\nmovement at a low error value includes active isometric muscle\nforces, viscous joint damping, and passive muscle elasticity.\nModel assumptions and reliability\nA very complex physiological model is likely to contain redun-\ndant parameters. Moreover, molecular details may be imple-\nmented realistically, but their role in generation of movement\nmay be difficult to determine (Dickinson et al., 2000). In contrast,\nwe formulate a relatively simple, mathematically tractable model\nbased on only a few plausible assumptions. It uses only single-\ncoefficient characteristics and the same characteristics for antag-\nonistic muscles. Our model has allowed us to determine the sig-\nnificance of individual characteristics that are of widespread\nimportance in the biomechanics literature (for example, Zajac,\n1989).\nThe model receives its input from single motoneurons, which\nwere recorded from the EMG of the antagonistic extensor and\nflexor tibiae muscles. The flexor muscle is innervated by nine\nmotoneurons (Sasaki and Burrows, 1998), approximately half of\nwhich we recorded. Therefore, there could be additional flexor\nactivity missing in our input signal. Because the activity of slow\nflexor motoneurons at both recording sites was correlated, we\nassume that the missing motoneurons were also active during\nsimilar time periods. All excitatory motoneurons were recorded\nfor the extensor. Our experiments sampled much of the move-\nment range of a locust hindleg. The comparison of unloaded and\nFigure 9. Active and passive components of torque production for all trials separated by\nstimulus position, loading condition (0, unloaded; L, loaded), and tibialmovement direction for\nmodel variant 5. The relationship between passive and active torques strongly depends on the\nstimulus position. In anterior stimulus position, extensor torque is mostly generated passively\n(gray bars), because the tibia is likely in a flexed position. In contrast, flexor generated torques\nare mostly active (black bars). For posterior movements, the leg is more extended than in\nanterior movements; therefore, the extensor passive torque contributes less to total torque,\nwhereas the flexor passive torque is larger than for anterior movements. Net torque (white\nasterisks, extensor torque minus flexor torque and damping) is mostly positive to compensate\ngravity.\nFigure10. Active extensor torque (blackboxes) andpassive extensor torque (grayboxes) for\nn\u0002 90 extensions with a minimummean joint velocity of 100\u00b0\/s and a duration of minimally\n160 ms. In the first half of an extension, passive torques were larger than actively generated\ntorques.\nFigure 11. Femur\u2013tibia joint torque during extensions is the extensor active and passive\ntorque (left bar of each pair) minus flexor torque and damping (right bar of each pair). In\nunloaded trials (gray bars), co-contraction of both muscles resulted in a median net torque of\n1.1 \u0001Nm, although each of the muscles produces\f25 \u0001Nm. In loaded trials (black bars),\nextensor torque is increased by 45.8% and flexor torque is reduced by 20.9%,which results in a\n16-fold increase of net torque to 18.4\u0001Nm.\n5004 \u2022 J. Neurosci., May 10, 2006 \u2022 26(19):4995\u20135007 Zakotnik et al. \u2022 Passive Forces in Load Compensation\nloaded trials extended the dynamic range of required muscle\nforces beyond the typical range of scratching behavior. In the\nhighly specialized motor programs underlying forceful kicking,\nthe slow motoneurons of both tibial muscles can produce higher\nspike rates and longer bursts than we recorded (Burrows, 1995),\nbut we are confident to have sampled most if not all of the natural\nphysiological working range for scratching.\nEach leg muscle also receives input from 1 or 2 inhibitors\n(CI), which were not recorded. The CI neurons receive sen-\nsory input from tarsal receptors (Usherwood and Runion,\n1970), which do not have any contact during scratching. The\nCI neurons are active during searching movements in the me-\nsothoracic leg (Wolf, 1990) and decrease relaxation time of the\nmuscles. In contrast, Usherwood and Runion (1970) have\nshown that the CI neurons may not be active in the metatho-\nracic extensor muscle during slow walking. If the CI neurons\nwere active in scratching, the time course of muscle activation\nshould have decayed faster than in the activation model used.\nThe level of co-contraction would have been reduced but\nprobably not abolished. During load compensation, reduced\nco-contraction increased net joint torque (Fig. 11). Moreover,\noptimization of the model to loaded trials results in a 22%\nincrease of extensor force with no change in flexor force (Table\n2). However, because the maximum muscle forces are con-\nstant in the animal, net torque could be increased by a faster\nrelaxation of the flexor muscle. Thus, the model predicts an\nincrease of CI activity in loaded trials.\nIn all model variants, the recorded neural signal was trans-\nformed into muscle force using a Hill-based muscle model\nwith a parallel passive elasticity and a force\u2013length\u2013velocity\nproperty (Zajac, 1989). All model variants lacked a serial elas-\ntic element because we assumed the apodeme to be stiff. This is\nsupported by measurements in the cockroach showing that\napodemes are 40 times stiffer than a vertebrate tendon (Ahn\nand Full, 2002).\nWithin the force\u2013length characteristic, muscle fiber length\nwas assumed to change by at most 50% of its resting length at\nextreme joint positions (Zajac, 1989). If the range for the muscle\nlength deviated from this assumption, this would decrease the PE\nforce. Therefore, the optimized PE parameter could be biased by\nthe muscle length range. For example, this bias could explain why\nthe optimized PE values are 2.5-fold larger than the value esti-\nmates made by Burrows and Horridge (1974).\nBecause pennation angle of muscle fibers is negligible for\nstick insect extensor muscle (Guschlbauer et al., 2005), a mus-\ncle similar to that in our study, it was omitted in the model.\nMuscle activation dynamics were assumed to be the same for\nextensor and flexor. The time course of activation was mea-\nsured for the slow extensor fibers. Because only trials with slow\nmotoneuron activity were used, we reason that flexor activa-\ntion and deactivation times were in the same range as those of\nthe extensor.\nThe overall low error in the predictions of our model suggests\nthat additional biomechanical properties that could influence\nforce generation do not play a significant role. Even if the param-\neter estimates used in the model deviated from real physiological\nvalues, the model would elucidate the relative contribution of the\ncomponents in movement generation.\nRole of passive forces in limb movement\nIn arthropods, passive forces may be strong enough to carry the\nweight of the animal (Yox et al., 1982). In the absence of neural\nactivity, the PE of the model acts to move the FT joint to a resting\nposition of \u000170\u00b0. This is similar to the angle measured by Bur-\nrows and Horridge (1974). To deflect the joint from this resting\nposition, an active torque must be generated. Therefore, the con-\ntrol of the movement is strongly dependent on the joint angle.\nFor example, if the tibia is flexed beyond resting position for\nanterior stimuli, the extensor PE generates a torque sufficient to\nresume the resting position in a purely passive manner. Thus, to\ngenerate a sequence of extensions and flexions in the cyclic\ngrooming response to anterior stimuli, only flexor activation\nneeds to be modulated. The nervous system could therefore use\nthe level of muscle activation to control the joint angle rather than\nthe joint torque, although muscle activation is primarily associ-\nated with muscle force. In the simplest case, an actively produced\njoint torque could depend linearly on the joint angle. Figure 12\nsuggests that this is the case for a wide range of joint angles.\nLocusts were more likely to use SETi at femoro-tibial angles\ngreater than the passive resting angle and more likely to use slow\nflexors at angles less than rest. It appears that nonlinearities of\npassive elasticity and moment arms combine to yield a linear\ntorque, permitting the animal to rely less on motor activation at\nfavorable angles.\nAccording to our model calculations, passive forces are in the\nsame range as actively generated forces and can thus explain tibial\nextensions observed without extensor activity (Berkowitz and\nLaurent, 1996) and our data. A similar model for passive forces\ncould also be applied for wiping behavior of a denervated frog, for\nwhich targeting accuracy does not deteriorate when a mechanical\ndisturbance is applied (Kargo and Rome, 2002; Richardson et al.,\n2005).\nA second passive mechanism contributing to joint stiffness is\nthe viscous damping included into our model. Garcia et al. (2000)\nhave shown that internal viscosity in the joint structure and sur-\nrounding tissues considerably damps oscillations of a cockroach\ntibia, but they did not examine damping during natural move-\nments. The damping property in our model could account for a\nlinear relationship between spike frequency and joint velocity as\nobserved in a cockroach leg (Watson and Ritzmann, 1998).\nFigure 12. Measured probability for an SETi spike (black bars) or a slow flexor tibiae mo-\ntoneuron spike (gray bars) defined by the ratio between the number of spikes and the number\nof recorded FT joint angles in each bin. The probability for an SETi spike increased for increasing\njoint angles, whereas the probability for a slow flexor spike decreased for increasing joint\nangles.\nZakotnik et al. \u2022 Passive Forces in Load Compensation J. Neurosci., May 10, 2006 \u2022 26(19):4995\u20135007 \u2022 5005\nCo-contraction of antagonists\nWe did not observe neural co-activation of antagonistic muscles,\ni.e., antagonistic motoneuron bursts did not overlap, even if the\nadditional load caused prolonged burst duration and increased\nspike frequency in extensor motoneurons (Fig. 1) (Zakotnik,\nPage, Matheson, and Du\u00a8rr, unpublished observations). Never-\ntheless, there is a substantial amount of co-contraction of muscles\nbecause of the slow activation and deactivation of muscle fibers\n(Fig. 7). Slow time constants of the stick insect extensor and\nflexor muscle fibers have also been reported by Ba\u00a8ssler and Stein\n(1996).\nCo-contraction is energetically expensive, because muscle\nforces are absorbed by the antagonist and do not contribute to\nmovement generation. In humans, it increases joint stiffness\n(Hogan, 1984; Carter et al., 1993), reduces the effect of inter-\naction torques from the movements of other joints (Gribble\nand Ostry, 1999), and increases accuracy of targeted arm\nmovements (Hogan, 1980; Gribble et al., 2003). In cock-\nroaches, joint stiffness attributable to co-contraction is a key\nparameter for running speed and adaption to different surface\ncompliances (Full and Farley, 2000) and stabilizes the impact\nwhen the leg touches ground at the beginning of the stance\nmovement (Ahn and Full, 2002). Matheson and Du\u00a8rr (2003)\nhypothesized that co-contraction could play a role in load\ncompensation during locust scratching. Our model shows that\nco-contraction of antagonists enables the muscles to increase\nnet joint torque with only small changes in neural activation\n(Fig. 11). Thus, a 43% change in extensor muscle torque is\nsufficient to increase the joint torque 16-fold and to move the\nloaded tibia against gravity in all postures. In contrast, without\nco-contraction, the extensor would need to generate 16-fold\nmore torque.\nOur model shows that biomechanical properties of the mus-\nculoskeletal system strongly affect the motor control of aimed\nlimb movements. The large passive joint stiffness in the model\npredicts that the joint angle is a relevant parameter for the neural\ncontrol of aimed leg movements. Antagonist muscle co-\ncontraction attributable to long muscle time constants facilitates\nsubstantial load compensation with little change of neural\nactivation.\nReferences\nAhn A, Full R (2002) A motor and a brake: two leg extensor muscles acting\nat the same joint manage energy differently in a running insect.
