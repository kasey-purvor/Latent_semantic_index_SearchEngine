In the last \n2 years he has advised Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Tyco Healthcare and Karl Storz Endoscopy (UK) Ltd\non the development of new laparoscopic equipment. He is also the Chair of the Data Monitoring\nCommittee of the MRC CLASICC trial of conventional versus laparoscopic-assisted surgery in\npatients with colorectal cancer. A McKinley was awarded a training fellowship from Ethicon Endo-\nSurgery in 2005. The fellowship covered travel and accommodation expenses for two trips to\nHamburg. One trip was for a 2-day international laparoscopic colorectal meeting. The other was for\na short visit (21\/2 days) to operate in the wet laboratory there, a facility not available in the UK. The\nclinical department of both Z Krukowski and A McKinley use, among others, Ethicon Endo-Surgery,\nTyco Healthcare, KeyMed (Medical & Industrial Equipment) Ltd and Richard Wolf UK Ltd equipment\nfor both open and laparoscopic procedures. A Grant attended a single meeting organised by Ethicon\nEndo-Surgery in 2003 to discuss possibilities for meta-analysis of trials of laparoscopic surgery for\ncolorectal cancer. The Health Services Research Unit and the Health Economics Research Unit both\nreceived funding from NHS Grampian to provide economics and statistical support for a randomised\ncontrol trial of stapled haemorrhoidplexy compared with rubber band ligation for grade II\nhaemorrhoids. NHS Grampian is receiving funding for this trial from Ethicon Endo-Surgery.\nPublished November 2006\nThis report should be referenced as follows:\nMurray A, Lourenco T, de Verteuil R, Hernandez R, Fraser C, McKinley A, et al.

HTA findings also help to improve the quality of the service in the NHS indirectly in\nthat they form a key component of the \u2018National Knowledge Service\u2019 that is being developed to improve\nthe evidence of clinical practice throughout the NHS.\nThe HTA Programme was set up in 1993. Its role is to ensure that high-quality research information on\nthe costs, effectiveness and broader impact of health technologies is produced in the most efficient way\nfor those who use, manage and provide care in the NHS. \u2018Health technologies\u2019 are broadly defined to\ninclude all interventions used to promote health, prevent and treat disease, and improve rehabilitation\nand long-term care, rather than settings of care.\nThe HTA Programme commissions research only on topics where it has identified key gaps in the\nevidence needed by the NHS. Suggestions for topics are actively sought from people working in the\nNHS, the public, service-users groups and professional bodies such as Royal Colleges and NHS Trusts. \nResearch suggestions are carefully considered by panels of independent experts (including service users)\nwhose advice results in a ranked list of recommended research priorities. The HTA Programme then\ncommissions the research team best suited to undertake the work, in the manner most appropriate to find\nthe relevant answers. Some projects may take only months, others need several years to answer the\nresearch questions adequately. They may involve synthesising existing evidence or conducting a trial to\nproduce new evidence where none currently exists.\nAdditionally, through its Technology Assessment Report (TAR) call-off contract, the HTA Programme is\nable to commission bespoke reports, principally for NICE, but also for other policy customers, such as a\nNational Clinical Director. TARs bring together evidence on key aspects of the use of specific\ntechnologies and usually have to be completed within a short time period.\nCriteria for inclusion in the HTA monograph series\nReports are published in the HTA monograph series if (1) they have resulted from work commissioned\nfor the HTA Programme, and (2) they are of a sufficiently high scientific quality as assessed by the referees\nand editors.\nReviews in Health Technology Assessment are termed \u2018systematic\u2019 when the account of the search,\nappraisal and synthesis methods (to minimise biases and random errors) would, in theory, permit the\nreplication of the review by others.\nThe research reported in this monograph was commissioned and funded by the HTA Programme on\nbehalf of NICE as project number 04\/44\/01. The protocol was agreed in May 2005. The assessment\nreport began editorial review in May 2006 and was accepted for publication in June 2006. The authors\nhave been wholly responsible for all data collection, analysis and interpretation, and for writing up their\nwork.

TObjective: The aim of this study was to determine the\nclinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of\nlaparoscopic, laparoscopically assisted (hereafter\ntogether described as laparoscopic surgery) and hand-\nassisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) in comparison\nwith open surgery for the treatment of colorectal\ncancer. \nData sources: Electronic databases were searched\nfrom 2000 to May 2005. A review of economic\nevaluations was undertaken by the National Institute\nfor Health and Clinical Excellence in 2001. This review\nwas updated from 2000 until July 2005. \nReview methods: Data from selected studies were\nextracted and assessed. Dichotomous outcome data\nfrom individual trials were combined using the relative\nrisk method and continuous outcomes were combined\nusing the Mantel\u2013Haenszel weighted mean difference\nmethod. Summaries of the results from individual\npatient data (IPD) meta-analyses were also presented.\nAn economic evaluation was also carried out using a\nMarkov model incorporating the data from the\nsystematic review. The results were first presented as a\nbalance sheet for comparison of the surgical\ntechniques. It was then used to estimate cost-\neffectiveness measured in terms of incremental cost\nper life-year gained and incremental cost per quality-\nadjusted life-year (QALY) for a time horizon up to \n25 years.\nResults: Forty-six reports on 20 studies [19\nrandomised controlled trials (RCTs) and one IPD \nmeta-analysis] were included in the review of clinical\neffectiveness. The RCTs were of generally moderate\nquality with the number of participants varying\nbetween 16 and 1082, with 10 having less than 100\nparticipants. The total numbers of trial participants who\nunderwent laparoscopic or open surgery were 2429\nand 2139, respectively. A systematic review of four\npapers suggested that laparoscopic surgery is more\ncostly than open surgery. However, the data they\nprovided on effectiveness was poorer than the\nevidence from the review of effectiveness. The\nestimates from the systematic review of clinical\neffectiveness were incorporated into a Markov model\nused to estimate cost-effectiveness for a time horizon\nof up to 25 years. In terms of incremental cost per life-\nyear, laparoscopic surgery was found to be more costly\nand no more effective than open surgery. With respect\nto incremental cost per QALY, few data were available\nto differentiate between laparoscopic and open\nsurgery. The results of the base-case analysis indicate\nthat there is an approximately 40% chance that\nlaparoscopic surgery is the more cost-effective\nintervention at a threshold willingness to pay for a\nQALY of \u00a330,000. A second analysis assuming equal\nmortality and disease-free survival found that there was\nan approximately 50% likelihood at a similar threshold\nvalue. Broadly similar results were found in the\nsensitivity analyses. A threshold analysis was performed\nto investigate the magnitude of QALY gain associated\nwith quicker recovery following laparoscopic surgery\nrequired to provide an incremental cost per QALY of\n\u00a330,000. The implied number of additional QALYs\nrequired would be 0.009\u20130.010 compared with open\nsurgery.\nConclusions: Laparoscopic resection is associated with\na quicker recovery (shorter time to return to usual\nactivities and length of hospitalisation) and no evidence\nof a difference in mortality or disease-free survival up\nto 3 years following surgery.

The rate of conversion may be\ndependent on experience in terms of both patient\nselection and performing the technique. Laparoscopic\nresection appears more costly to the health service\nthan open resection, with an estimated extra total cost\nof between \u00a3250 and \u00a3300 per patient. In terms of\nrelative cost-effectiveness, laparoscopic resection is\nassociated with a modest additional cost, short-term\nbenefits associated with more rapid recovery and\nsimilar long-term outcomes in terms of survival and\ncure rates up to 3 years. Assuming equivalence of long-\nterm outcomes, a judgement is required as to whether\nthe benefits associated with earlier recovery are worth\nthis extra cost. The long-term follow-up of the RCT\ncohorts would be very useful further research and\nideally these data should be incorporated into a wider\nIPD meta-analysis. Data on the long-term complications\nof surgery such as incisional hernias and differences in\noutcomes such as persisting pain would also be\nvaluable. Once available, further data on both costs and\nutilities should be included in an updated model. At this\npoint, further consideration should then be given as to\nwhether additional data should be collected within\nongoing trials. Few data were available to assess the\nrelative merits of HALS. Ideally, there should be more\ndata from methodologically sound RCTs. Further\nresearch is needed on whether the balance of\nadvantages and disadvantages of laparoscopic surgery\nvaries within subgroups based on the different stages\nand locations of disease. Research relating to the effect\nof experience on performance is also required.\nAbstract\nivList of abbreviations .................................. vii\nExecutive summary .................................... ix\n1 Aim of the review ...................................... 1\n2 Background ................................................ 3\nDescription of underlying health \nproblem ...................................................... 3\nCurrent service provision ........................... 5\nDescription of new intervention  ................ 6\n3 Effectiveness ............................................... 9\nMethods for reviewing effectiveness .......... 9\nResults ........................................................ 10\nSummary and conclusions of the evidence \nfor and against the intervention ................ 24\n4 Systematic review of economic \nevaluations ................................................. 27\nMethods ...................................................... 27\nResults ........................................................ 28\nComment on the submission by the \nAssociation of Laparoscopic Surgeons of \nGreat Britain and Ireland (ALSGBI)  ......... 31\nSummary of results and discussion ............ 32\nConclusions ................................................ 34\n5 Economic evaluation .................................. 35\nIntroduction ............................................... 35\nThe balance sheet approach ...................... 35\nEconomic model  ........................................ 38\nSummary of evidence on \ncost-effectiveness ........................................ 60\n6 Implications for other parties .................... 61\nQuality of life for the family and carers  .... 61\nFinancial impact for the patient and \nothers .......................................................... 61\n7 Implications for the NHS .......................... 63\nTraining ...................................................... 63\nFair access and equity issues  ...................... 63\nResource transfers between primary and\nsecondary care ............................................ 63\nAvailability of theatre space  ....................... 63\nBudgetary impact on the NHS .................. 63\n8 Discussion ................................................... 65\nMain results ................................................ 65\nAssumptions, limitations and \nuncertainties ............................................... 66\n9 Conclusions ................................................ 69\nImplications for the NHS  .......................... 69\nImplications for patients and carers ............. 69\nImplications for research  ........................... 69\nAcknowledgements .................................... 71\nReferences .................................................. 73\nAppendix 1 Search strategies .................... 79\nAppendix 2 Study eligibility form ............. 85\nAppendix 3 Data extraction form ............. 87\nAppendix 4 Quality assessment form \u2013\nsystematic reviews ....................................... 95\nAppendix 5 Quality assessment form \u2013 \nRCTs ........................................................... 97\nAppendix 6 List of included studies  ......... 99\nAppendix 7 Detailed quality assessment \nscore for each of the included studies  ....... 103\nAppendix 8 Characteristics of included \nstudies ......................................................... 105\nAppendix 9 Results of meta-analysis:\nlaparoscopic resection versus conventional\nopen resection ............................................ 119\nAppendix 10 Summary of outcomes \nreported in converted patients  .................. 125\nAppendix 11 Summary of included \neconomic evaluations ................................. 127\nAppendix 12 Estimation of parameter\nestimates used in the economic model....... 139\nAppendix 13 Markov model for the\nmanagement of colorectal cancer .............. 141\nHealth Technology Assessment reports\npublished to date ....................................... 143\nHealth Technology Assessment \nProgramme  ................................................ 157\nContents\nHealth Technology Assessment 2006;

All rights reserved.\nPrevious guidance from the National Institute for\nHealth and Clinical Excellence (NICE) on the use\nof laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer is that\nopen surgery is the preferred procedure and that\nlaparoscopic surgery should only be undertaken as\npart of a randomised controlled trial (RCT). This\nguidance was based on a technology assessment\nreview conducted in 2000. New evidence has since\nbecome available, providing additional data on\nboth the short- and long-term outcomes of\nsurgery. \nObjective of the study\nThe aim of this study was to determine the \nclinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of\nlaparoscopic, laparoscopically assisted (hereafter\ntogether described as laparoscopic surgery) and\nhand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) in\ncomparison with open surgery for the treatment \nof colorectal cancer. Where evidence allowed,\npossible differential effects were explored within a\nnumber of subgroups. The subgroups relate to the\nlocation of the cancer, the stage of the cancer and\nage at diagnosis.\nDescription of proposed service\nIn laparoscopic surgery, ports are inserted through\nwhich the laparoscopic instruments are\nmanipulated. In practical terms, a totally\nlaparoscopic procedure and a laparoscopically\nassisted procedure are considered comparable\nbecause of the size of incisions involved and\nhereafter are jointly described as laparoscopic\nsurgery. In HALS, the surgeon inserts a hand into\nthe abdomen while pneumoperitoneum is\nmaintained. \nEpidemiology and background\nColorectal cancer is the second most common\nmalignancy in England and Wales. Approximately\n36,000 new cases were diagnosed in 2002 and\n17,000 people died from colorectal cancer in the\nsame year. About 80% of all patients diagnosed\nwith colorectal cancer (including some with\nadvanced disease) undergo surgery.  \nOpen resection is currently the standard method\nfor primary resection of tumours. However, there\nis significant morbidity associated with this\nprocedure. Laparoscopic surgery is less invasive\nand may lead to more rapid recovery. The\npotential impact on cure rates is not clear. The\nmajor concerns are that tumour recurrence might\noccur at port sites and that clearance of the\ntumour may be less complete than during open\nsurgery. However, it has also been suggested that\nreduced tissues trauma may lower disruption to\nthe immune system and hence reduce the risk of\nrecurrence. Additionally, there are disadvantages\nof laparoscopic surgery relating to the longer\noperation length, the cost of materials and the\neffect of surgeon experience on patient outcomes. \nThis review assesses the clinical effectiveness and\ncost-effectiveness of laparoscopic surgery and HALS\nin comparison with open surgery for the treatment\nof colorectal cancer. This was evaluated in terms of\nshort-term, long-term and recurrence outcomes.\nThe possible differential effects within predefined\nsubgroups relating to the location of the cancer, the\nstage of the cancer and age at diagnosis were\nexplored, although limited data were available.\nMethods\nEffectiveness\nElectronic searches were undertaken from 2000 to\nMay 2005 to identify published and unpublished\ntrials of laparoscopic compared with open surgery\nfor colorectal cancer. Systematic reviews and other\nevidence-based reports were identified and their\nlists of references searched. Selected conference\nproceedings were searched. \nAll RCTs and quasi-RCTs were eligible for\ninclusion if they compared laparoscopic surgery or\nHALS with open surgery for colorectal cancer. Also\neligible were individual patient data (IPD) meta-\nanalyses of such studies, where they provided\nadditional data.\nTwo reviewers independently extracted data and\nassessed study quality. Dichotomous outcome data\nfrom individual trials were combined using the\nrelative risk method and continuous outcomes\nExecutive summaryx\nwere combined using the Mantel\u2013Haenszel\nweighted mean difference method. Summaries of\nthe results from IPD meta-analyses were also\npresented.\nCost-effectiveness\nA review of economic evaluations was undertaken\nby NICE in 2001. This review was updated from\n2000 until July 2005. Quality assessment and data\nabstraction were conducted according to the\nguidelines for reviewers for the NHS Economic\nEvaluation Database.\nAn economic evaluation was also carried out using\na Markov model incorporating the data from the\nsystematic review. This model was first used to\npresent a balance sheet for comparison of the\nsurgical techniques. It was then used to estimate\ncost-effectiveness measured in terms of\nincremental cost per life-year gained and\nincremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year\n(QALY) for a time horizon up to 25 years.\nResults\nNumber and quality of studies\nIn total, 46 reports on 20 studies (19 RCTs and\none IPD meta-analysis) were included in the\nreview of clinical effectiveness. The RCTs were of\ngenerally moderate quality with the number of\nparticipants varying between 16 and 1082, with 10\nhaving less than 100 participants. The total\nnumbers of trial participants who underwent\nlaparoscopic or open surgery were 2429 and 2139,\nrespectively.\nCost-effectiveness\nA systematic review of four papers suggested that\nlaparoscopic surgery is more costly than open\nsurgery. However, the data they provided on\neffectiveness was poorer than the evidence from\nthe review of effectiveness. One study compared\nthe two forms of surgery in the context of an\nenhanced recovery programme. This study\nreported no difference in effectiveness and similar\ncosts for both laparoscopic and open surgery. A\nfurther small study was identified comparing\nlaparoscopic with HALS. This study also reported\nsimilar estimates of effectiveness and cost.\nThe estimates from the systematic review of\nclinical effectiveness were incorporated into a\nMarkov model used to estimate cost-effectiveness\nfor a time horizon of up to 25 years. In terms of\nincremental cost per life-year, laparoscopic surgery\nappeared more costly and no more effective than\nopen surgery. With respect to incremental cost \nper QALY, few data were available to differentiate\nbetween laparoscopic and open surgery. The\nresults of the base-case analysis indicate that there\nis an approximately 40% chance that laparoscopic\nsurgery is the more cost-effective intervention at a\nthreshold willingness to pay for a QALY of\n\u00a330,000. A second analysis assuming equal\nmortality and disease-free survival found that\nthere was an approximately 50% likelihood at a\nsimilar threshold value.\nSensitivity analyses\nBroadly similar results were found in the sensitivity\nanalyses. A threshold analysis was performed to\ninvestigate the magnitude of QALY gain associated\nwith quicker recovery following laparoscopic\nsurgery required to provide an incremental cost\nper QALY of \u00a330,000. The implied number of\nadditional QALYs required would be 0.009\u20130.010\ncompared with open surgery.\nLimitations of the calculations\n(assumptions made)\nMuch information available for some outcomes\nwas reported in a form that was unsuitable for\nentry into the meta-analyses. The main limitations\nrelated to the quantity and quality of the data\navailable. For example, the best data on mortality\nand disease-free survival were only available for a\n3-year follow-up.\nThe nature of the data available also had an\nimpact on the economic evaluation, which\nextrapolated outcomes for up to 25 years. More\nimportantly, the data available to estimate costs\nwere limited and the data used to estimate \nQALYs were highly suspect. The UK-based\nmulticentre Conventional versus Laparoscopic-\nAssisted Surgery in Colorectal Cancer (CLASICC)\ntrial is due to report its economic evaluation \nsoon and a draft version of a cost analysis\nconducted alongside the CLASICC trial was\nincorporated within the economic model as\nsensitivity analysis. The results of this analysis are\nnot contained in this report as the data were\nsupplied in confidence. Nevertheless, it is\nexpected that this study will provide additional\ndata on costs and will provide utility scores\nrelevant to the UK.\nConclusions\nSummary of benefits\nLaparoscopic resection is associated with a quicker\nrecovery (shorter time to return to usual activities\nExecutive summaryand length of hospitalisation) and no evidence of\na difference in mortality or disease-free survival up\nto 3 years following surgery. However, operation\ntimes are longer and a significant number of\nprocedures initiated laparoscopically may need to\nbe converted to open surgery. The rate of\nconversion may be dependent on experience in\nterms of both patient selection and performing\nthe technique. \nCosts\nLaparoscopic resection appears more costly to the\nhealth service than open resection, with an\nestimated extra total cost of between \u00a3250 and\n\u00a3300 per patient. \nCost-effectiveness\nIn terms of relative cost-effectiveness, laparoscopic\nresection is associated with a modest additional\ncost, short-term benefits associated with more\nrapid recovery and similar long-term outcomes in\nterms of survival and cure rates up to 3 years.\nAssuming equivalence of long-term outcomes, a\njudgement is required as to whether the benefits\nassociated with earlier recovery are worth this\nextra cost.\nOther important issues regarding\nimplications\nShould the use of laparoscopic surgery be\nincreased from its current level of 0.1% to 25% \nof total resections, then the extra cost to the \nNHS has been estimated at \u00a32.1 million \nper year. \nThe increased adoption of laparoscopic techniques\nmay allow patients to return to usual activities\nfaster. This may, for some people, reduce any loss\nof income. However, current provision is very\nlimited and few patients have access to\nlaparoscopic surgery.\nFor the NHS, increased use of laparoscopic\nsurgery would lead to an increased requirement\nfor training, which may be costly. Owing to the\nlimited number of surgeons currently providing\nlaparoscopic surgery, it may take some time before\nthe provision of laparoscopic surgery can be\nincreased.\nBoth open and laparoscopic surgery may be\nprovided in the context of an enhanced recovery\nprogramme. Such an approach may reduce length\nof stay for both procedures but may not lead to\nreduced total costs to the NHS.\nNotes on the generalisability of the\nfindings\nThe 19 trials were conducted in a wide range of\nsettings but data relating to the subgroups were\nlimited. With respect to the data on costs, only two\nUK studies were identified, one of which was a\npreliminary analysis. Such cost data as were\navailable may not reflect practice within the UK.\nFurther data, when available from the CLASICC\ntrial, would improve the confidence with which the\nfindings can be generalised.\nNeed for further research\nAlthough useful data on long-term outcomes were\navailable from the IPD meta-analysis identified as\npart of the review, this study only reported data\nfrom four RCTs for up to 3 years. The long-term\nfollow-up of the RCT cohorts would be very useful\nand ideally these data should be incorporated into\na wider IPD meta-analysis. \nFew data were available on the long-term\ncomplications of surgery such as incisional hernias.\nGiven the apparent similarity between the\nprocedures in survival and disease-free survival,\nattention might be given to identifying differences\nin outcomes such as persisting pain, that may\naffect a patient\u2019s quality of life.\nKey limitations of the economic model were the\nlimited data on both costs and utilities. Once\navailable, such data should be included in an\nupdated model. At this point, further\nconsideration should then be given as to whether\nadditional data should be collected within ongoing\ntrials.\nFew data were available to assess the relative\nmerits of HALS. Ideally, there should be more\ndata from methodologically sound RCTs.\nFurther research is needed on whether the balance\nof advantages and disadvantages of laparoscopic\nsurgery varies within subgroups based on the\ndifferent stages and locations of disease.\nLaparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer is, like\nother laparoscopic procedures, technically\nchallenging and performance is likely to improve\nwith experience. This issue is important in its\nevaluation and further methodologically sound\nresearch related to this is warranted in the context\nof both trials and meta-analyses of trial data.\nHealth Technology Assessment 2006; Vol. 10: No. 45\nxi\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2006.

The colon is about\n1.5\u20131.8 m long and consists of four parts: the\nascending, transverse, descending and sigmoid\ncolon. The rectum is a straight, muscular tube,\nwhich commences at the end of the sigmoid colon\nand terminates at the anal canal.5\nThe aetiology of colorectal cancer is multifactorial,\nincluding genetic and environmental factors.5\nColorectal cancer frequently results from\nmalignant change in an adenomatous polyp that\nhas developed in the lining of the large intestine.\nColorectal cancers are broadly divided into two\ngroups, depending on their location within the\nlarge bowel. Colonic cancer consists of all tumours\noccurring in the area from the large intestine\nproximal to the rectum. Rectal cancer is defined as\na tumour within 15 cm of the anal verge.6,7\nColorectal cancer most commonly presents with\nchronic symptoms such as rectal bleeding, a\nchange in bowel habit or iron deficiency anaemia.6\nA proportion of patients present as emergencies\nwith bowel obstruction, perforation or bleeding.\nTable 1 provides further details of the mode of\npresentation.\nEpidemiology\nColorectal cancer is the second most common\nmalignancy in England and Wales in terms both of\nincidence and mortality.9 Approximately 36,000\nnew cases were diagnosed in 2002 and 17,000\npeople died from colorectal cancer in the same\nyear. Over the last three decades, colorectal cancer\nmortality has fallen by over 25% whereas\nincidence has increased slowly (Figure 1).\nThe overall incidence of colorectal cancer is\nhigher in men than in women (Figure 2). In the\nUK, the male to female ratios for colonic and\nrectal cancer are 11:10 and 7:4, respectively.11\nThis holds for all age groups. There is no\nevidence that the pathogenesis of the disease\ndiffers by gender.12\nThe mean age at diagnosis for colorectal cancer in\nthe UK is 65 years.13 As Figure 2 illustrates, the\nincidence of colorectal cancer rises sharply with\nage with approximately 41% of patients affected\nbeing over 75 years of age and 57% of deaths\nfrom colorectal cancer occurring in this age\ngroup.14 Table 2 gives further details specific for\nEngland, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nA small subgroup of colorectal cancer is caused by\ninherited predisposition; however, it is estimated\nthat over 75% of cases arise \u2018sporadically\u2019\n(Figure 3).

Patients\nwith colorectal cancer may suffer pain, bleeding,\nfrequent or irregular bowel movements, diarrhoea\nand fatigue.18,19 Studies have reported a decrease\nin quality-of-life scores during the first few months\nafter colorectal surgery, followed by improvements\n3\u20136 months after surgery.20\nCurrent service provision\nIn the UK, open surgical resection of all malignant\ntissue is the recommended primary treatment for\ncolorectal cancer.1 Approximately 80% of all\npatients diagnosed with colorectal cancer\n(including some with advanced disease) undergo\nsurgery.21 Most surgical resections are performed\nas elective procedures. However, up to 30% of\nprimary resections present as an emergency\n(Table 3).13\nOpen surgical resection of primary colorectal\ntumour is the most common procedure for\ntreating colorectal cancer. However, morbidity\nrates associated with this can be high.\nLaparoscopic surgery is less invasive and is\ntherefore likely to lead to more rapid recovery\nfrom the operation. It has also been suggested\nthat the reduced trauma associated with\nlaparoscopic procedures might minimise any\ndisruption to the immune system caused by\nsurgery and hence reduce the risk of recurrence.22\nHowever, there are concerns that tumour\nrecurrence might occur at port sites and the\npotential impact on cure rates is not established.\nAdditionally, there are disadvantages relating to\nthe longer length of the operation, the cost of\nmaterials and the effect of surgeon experience on\npatient outcomes.\nSome of the disadvantages associated with open\nsurgical resection include: incisional pain, intra-\nand postoperative metabolic stress, tissue trauma\nand postoperative ileus from manual intestinal\nmanipulation.23 It has been postulated that\nlaparoscopic surgery may reduce the impact of\nthese. If so, this might justify the apparent\nincrease in interest amongst surgeons to introduce\nlaparoscopic techniques to treat colorectal cancer.\nThe open surgical procedure (laparotomy)\nrequires a relatively long incision through the\nabdominal wall.23 The surgical resection of the\ncancer itself involves the removal of the bowel\ncontaining the tumour, adequate disease-free\nHealth Technology Assessment 2006; Vol. 10: No. 45\n5\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2006.

Whenever possible, this\nis followed by anastomosis, suturing or stapling\nthe proximal colon to the rectum\/anus.\nAccording to the 2003\u20134 hospital episode\nstatistics, 31,356 primary resections were\nperformed in England using 473,530 bed days\nwith patients staying in hospital for a mean of\n17 days. The majority of these were colonic\nresections (61%). Within the six periods surveyed,\nthere was a relative decrease in the number of\nprimary resections performed (Table 3).13\nDescription of new intervention\nLaparoscopic surgery\nMinimally invasive approaches to treat colorectal\ndiseases were developed to take advantage of the\nbenefits observed in laparoscopic procedures\nelsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract.24 In\nlaparoscopic surgery, ports are inserted through\nwhich the laparoscopic surgical instruments are\nmanipulated. In practical terms, a totally\nlaparoscopic procedure and a laparoscopically\nassisted procedure are considered comparable\nbecause of the size of incisions involved. Hand-\nassisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) is a different\nconcept and is discussed below. \nAdoption has been relatively slow since the first\nentirely laparoscopic colorectal resection was\nperformed in July 1991.24 Difficulties include\nworking in multiple sites within the peritoneal\ncavity, inadequate instrumentation, evolving\nsurgical techniques and the necessity to remove a\nlarge specimen.25 Taken against a background of\nfears about adequacy of tumour clearance, these\nhave combined to inhibit widespread adoption.\nLaparoscopically assisted surgery\nIn laparoscopically assisted surgery, the bowel is\nmobilised laparoscopically and extracted through\nan enlarged laparoscopic port site with excision\nand\/or anastomosis performed externally. As\nnoted earlier, throughout the remainder of this\nreport laparoscopic and laparoscopically assisted\nsurgery are collectively called laparoscopic surgery.\nHand-assisted laparoscopic surgery\n(HALS)\nIn HALS, the surgeon inserts a hand into the\nabdomen while pneumoperitoneum is maintained.\nSome surgeons find this easier than laparoscopic\nsurgery, particularly in the transitional phase\nbetween conventional and laparoscopic surgery.\nAdvantages claimed for placing the hand in the\nabdomen include tactile feedback, the ability to\npalpate, blunt dissection, organ retraction, control\nof bleeding and rapid organ removal.26\u201328\nIdentification of subgroups of patients\nResection can be performed in patients of all ages\nand both genders, with any stage of cancer and\nlocation. However, stay in the intensive care unit\nand postoperative hospitalisation have been\nreported to be significantly longer in patients\nolder than 70 years.29 In addition, surgical\nprocedures for advanced colorectal cancer are\nmost commonly used to relieve obstructing lesions\nand pelvic symptoms.30 The laparoscopic\ntreatment of rectal cancer is more difficult than for\ncolonic cancers.31 Currently, laparoscopic\nprocedures are unlikely to be used in emergency\nsituations and the study has not considered a\nsubgroup analysis for the comparison of\nalternative forms of resection in patients\npresenting as emergencies.\nBackground\n6\nTABLE 3 Details of primary colorectal resections, England, 1998\u2013200413\nYear No. of  Emergency Male (%) Average age  Aged over  Mean stay \nresections (%) (years) 75 years (%) (days)a\n2003\u201304 31,356 28.0 50.9 65.5 33 17.1\n2002\u201303 31,705 28.6 51.4 65.5 33 17.3\n2001\u201302 31,331 29.7 50.9 65.5 33 17.7\n2000\u201301 31,796 27.7 50.0 66 33 17.4\n1999\u20132000 32,725 29.0 50.0 65.5 32 17.1\n1998\u201399 32,580 24.8 50.0 66 33 17.0\na Over this period, the median length of hospital stay has remained at 13 and 14 days for colon and rectal cancer,\nrespectively.Criteria for treatment\nLaparoscopic treatment is contraindicated in\npatients who have significant bowel dilatation or\nwho are intolerant of a pneumoperitoneum.32\nFurthermore, conversion from laparoscopic to\nopen surgery may negate any advantage of an\ninitial laparoscopic approach. Consequently,\npatients at high risk of conversion from\nlaparoscopic to open surgery should be identified\npreoperatively and receive open surgery. Factors\nthat may be relevant include body habitus,\nextensive peritoneal adhesions and local spread of\nthe tumour.\nPersonnel involved\nThe number of staff employed in laparoscopic\noperations is usually similar to that involved in\nopen resections. The operating time for\nlaparoscopic resection is believed to be longer.\nLaparoscopic resection is a technically more\ndifficult procedure and there is a long learning\ncurve,30 in which a relatively large number of cases\n(30\u201350) are required for the surgeon to obtain\nproficiency.29\nSetting\nThe mean length of hospital stay for patients\nundergoing open resections in the UK as judged\nfrom routinely collected hospital episode statistics\nis approximately 17 days.13 The time from\nhospital admission to discharge has been\nsuggested to be lower for patients undergoing\nlaparoscopic surgery.33\u201335\nTo a large extent, length of hospital stay after\nsurgery is dependent on local surgical policy.\nHowever, it is also influenced by prolonged pain,\nnausea and vomiting, persistence of ileus, fatigue,\nmechanical factors (such as the presence of\ndrains), stress-induced organ dysfunction and\npostoperative complications.36,37 It has been\nclaimed that an \u2018enhanced recovery programme\u2019\nspecially designed to address these factors can\nlead to a marked decrease in length of stay36\u201339\nwith no increased morbidity, deterioration in\nquality of life or increased cost.40 An enhanced\nrecovery programme is characterised by a highly\nscripted pre- and postoperative care plan\nregulating the introduction of analgesia, diet and\nambulation.36 It has been suggested that the\nlength of hospital stay of patients undergoing an\nopen resection followed by an enhanced recovery\nprogramme could match that seen after\nlaparoscopic resection. \nIrrespective of type of approach to surgery, it is\nwidely recommended that colorectal cancer\npatients should be nursed in an environment that\npromotes independence and mobilisation, with\npatients out of bed for 2 hours on the day of\nsurgery and for 6 hours each day from then on.37\nEquipment required\nAll laparoscopic techniques incur additional\nmaterial costs compared with an open operation\nbecause of the requirement for an endoscopy\nsystem. This includes items such as ports, staplers,\ndiathermy and ultrasonic instruments. These\nadditional costs are strongly influenced by the\namount of disposable equipment used.\nDegree of diffusion \nThe current NICE guidance on the use of\nlaparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer1 states\nthat:\n\u201c1. For colorectal cancer, open rather than\nlaparoscopic resection should be the preferred\nsurgical procedure.\n2. Laparoscopic surgery should only be\nundertaken for colorectal cancer as part of a\nrandomised clinical trial.\u201d\nReflecting this, laparoscopic colorectal surgery has\nnot been adopted widely. From 1998 to 2001 there\nwere no changes in the percentage of colorectal\ncancer cases treated with laparoscopic surgery in\nthe UK (around 0.1%).41\nA survey42 performed among existing members of\nthe Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain\nand Ireland (ACPGBI) has identified that only 45\nsurgeons currently perform laparoscopic colorectal\nresections. \nExpected costs\nThe current use of laparoscopic colorectal surgery\nis low but there is the potential for its use to\nincrease dramatically. The expected costs of\nadopting laparoscopic surgery based on different\ndegrees of diffusion are illustrated in Table 4. The\ntotal direct costs to the NHS are based on mean\ncosts of \u00a36117 and \u00a35852 for laparoscopic and\nopen surgery, respectively (the methods used to\nestimate these costs are described in Chapter 5).\nThe number of resections per year is based on the\ndata for 2003\u20134 reported in Table 3.\nThese projections suggest that if the use of\nlaparoscopic resection increased to a relatively\nmodest 1%, then the total cost to the NHS in\nEngland would increase by approximately\n\u00a375,000. However, these estimates are subject to\nconsiderable uncertainty. First, the costs of both\nHealth Technology Assessment 2006; Vol. 10: No. 45\n7\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2006. All rights reserved.laparoscopic and open surgery are not known\nprecisely. Second, the calculations have assumed a\nfixed operation cost and therefore have not\nconsidered whether the unit cost of laparoscopic\nresection would change as diffusion increases.\nFinally, these figures do not reflect the cost of\ntraining the increased numbers of surgeons\nrequired to perform the additional operations.\nBackground\n8\nTABLE 4 Cost of surgery for colorectal cancer\nProportion of total resections that  NHS cost  Additional cost above the cost of \nare laparoscopic (%) (\u00a3 million) current provision (\u00a3000)\n0.1 183.5 0\n1.0 183.6 74.8\n5.0 183.9 407.2\n10.0 184.3 822.6\n15.0 184.7 1238.1\n20.0 185.2 1653.6\n25.0 185.6 2069.0T\nhe Health Technology Assessment (HTA)\nreport submitted to NICE in July 2000, when\nlaparoscopic surgery for the treatment of\ncolorectal cancer was first appraised, summarised\nthe evidence on clinical effectiveness available at\nthat time.1 Not all studies included in that report\nmet the inclusion criteria for this update and it\nbecame apparent that some RCTs reported before\n2000 had not been included in the original review.\nEvidence for assessing the clinical effectiveness\nconsidered in this report therefore comprises the\neligible trials from the original report in addition\nto RCTs and individual patient data meta-analyses\nidentified from literature searching performed for\nthis review, plus additional pre-2000 RCTs\nincluded in systematic reviews identified from the\nliterature search. \nMethods for reviewing\neffectiveness\nSearch strategy\nElectronic searches were undertaken to identify\npublished and unpublished reports of RCTs \nand systematic reviews evaluating the effectiveness\nof laparoscopic surgery and HALs for colorectal\ncancer. Searches were restricted to the years \n2000 onwards without language restriction and\nincluded abstracts from recent conference\nproceedings.\nThe main databases searched were MEDLINE\n(2000\u2013May Week 1, 2005), EMBASE\n(2000\u2013Week 19, 2005), BIOSIS (2000\u2013May 2005),\nScience Citation Index (2000\u201327 May 2005),\nMEDLINE Extra (11 May 2005), Cochrane\nControlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library,\nIssue 2, 2005), Cochrane Database of Systematic\nReviews (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2005),\nDatabase of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness\n(May 2005), HTA Database (May 2005), Health\nManagement Information Consortium (2000\u2013May\n2005) and Journals@Ovid Full Text (2000\u2013July\n2005 for selected surgical journals). In addition,\nrecent conference proceedings and reference lists\nof all included studies were scanned to identify\nadditional potentially relevant studies. Full details\nof the search strategies used are documented in\nAppendix 1.\nAll titles and abstracts identified in these ways\nwere assessed to identify potentially eligible\nstudies. Two reviewers independently assessed\nthem for inclusion, using a study eligibility form\ndeveloped for this purpose (Appendix 2). Any\ndisagreements were resolved by consensus or\narbitration. Systematic reviews were used to\nidentify pre-2000 RCTs but were not included in\nthis review. Lead authors of all included RCTs\nwere contacted directly to identify further studies\nand unpublished data.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nTypes of studies\nWe included individual RCTs and individual patient\ndata meta-analyses of RCTs of laparoscopic surgery,\nlaparoscopic-assisted surgery and HALS compared\nwith open surgery for colorectal cancer. UK\nregistries, providing data for a minimum of 3 years\u2019\nfollow-up for any of the surgical techniques, either\nalone or in comparison with each other, were also\nincluded. Studies were eligible irrespective of the\nlanguage in which they were reported. Initially, we\nhad intended to include cohort studies with a\nminimum follow-up of 3 years, but in the event we\ndecided that this was not necessary as the length of\nfollow-up available from RCTs (and particularly an\nindividual patient data meta-analysis of RCTs) was\nconsidered sufficient to provide long-term data that\nwere more robust than data from non-randomised\ncohort studies.\nTypes of participants\nStudies of adults with colorectal cancer who have\nundergone surgery were included. Patients\nundergoing palliative treatment (non-curative\nsurgery) were excluded. In addition, the following\nsubgroups were considered: location of cancer;\nstage of cancer; and mean age at diagnosis. Other\nsubgroups, such as gender or grade of cancer,\nmight have been considered. In the former case it\nwas not expected that gender would greatly\ninfluence the results and in the latter case it was\nnot expected that there would be any data. \nTypes of outcomes\nThe following measures of outcomes were sought:\nShort-term outcomes:\n\u25cf duration of operation\nHealth Technology Assessment 2006; Vol. 10: No. 45\n9\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2006.

However, they were\nnot included as outcomes as they were felt to be\nsurrogates for length of stay and postoperative\nrecovery.\nData extraction strategy\nThe titles and abstracts of all papers identified \nby the search strategy were screened. Full text\ncopies of all potentially relevant studies were\nobtained and two reviewers independently\nassessed them for inclusion. Reviewers were not\nblinded to the names of studies\u2019 authors,\ninstitutions or sources of the reports. Any\ndisagreements were resolved by consensus or\narbitration.\nA data extraction form was developed to record\ndetails of trial methods, participants,\ninterventions, patient characteristics and outcomes\n(Appendix 3). Two reviewers independently\nextracted data from the included studies. Any\ndifferences that could not be resolved through\ndiscussion were referred to an arbiter. With respect\nto outcomes data, the authors\u2019 definitions of\noutcomes were used. Such definitions may vary\nbetween included studies but would be consistent\nwithin studies and hence would still be useful\nwhen estimating relative effect sizes.\nQuality assessment strategy\nTwo reviewers, working independently, assessed\nthe methodological quality of the included studies.\nAgain, any disagreements were resolved by\nconsensus or arbitration. The methodological\nquality of the meta-analysis was assessed by a\npreviously validated nine-item checklist\n(Appendix 4) developed by Oxman and\ncolleagues.43,44 Primary RCTs were assessed using\nthe Delphi criteria list45 (Appendix 5).\nData synthesis\nFor trials with multiple publications, only the most\nup-to-date data for each outcome were included.\nDichotomous outcome data were combined using\nthe Mantel\u2013Haenszel relative risk (RR) method.\nThis statistic was used as it was more appropriate\nfor use in the economic model developed in\nChapter 5. Continuous outcomes were combined\nusing the inverse variance weighted mean\ndifference (WMD) method; 95% confidence\nintervals (CIs) and p-values were calculated for the\nestimates of RR and WMD. All results are reported\nusing a fixed-effects model. \u00012 tests and I-squared\nstatistics were used to explore statistical\nheterogeneity across studies and, when present,\nrandom effects methods were applied. Other\npossible reasons for heterogeneity were explored\nusing sensitivity analyses. The meta-analyses were\nconducted using the standard Cochrane software\nRevMan 4.2.\nOwing to the lack of uniformity of the data\npresented in many studies, a qualitative review\nlooking for consistency between studies was also\nperformed. This was supplemented, where\nappropriate, by the investigation of the consistency\nin the direction of the results using the Sign test.46\nOpposite method initiated was defined as a\nlaparoscopic operation initiated when an open\nresection was allocated, or vice versa. Duration of\noperation was defined as time from first incision\nto last suture or, where this was not available, time\nin theatre or duration of anaesthesia. Length of\nhospital stay was defined as time from admission\nto discharge. A conversion was defined as a\nprocedure initiated as laparoscopic but converted\nto an open procedure.\nResults\nQuantity and quality of research available\nNumber of studies identified\nThe results of the searches are summarised in\nTable 5. The numbers retrieved from the \nEffectiveness\n10searches in SCI, BIOSIS, Journals@Ovid Full \nText and CENTRAL include only the additional\nreports found after excluding those identified\nfrom the MEDLINE\/EMBASE multifile \nsearch.\nA total of 982 reports were identified from the\nvarious searches, of which 167 (157 full-text\npapers and 10 abstracts) were selected for full\nassessment. Table 6 details the numbers of these\nthat were included and excluded.\nNumber and type of studies included\nThirty-three papers (31 full-text papers and two\nabstracts) met the inclusion criteria for the review.\nIn addition, 11 pre-2000 reports were included,\nfive from the original review and six that were not\nincluded but were identified from other systematic\nreviews. A further two reports, both unpublished,\nwere obtained from their authors (Bonjer J, QE II\nHealth Sciences Centre, Halifax, NS: personal\ncommunication, 2005).40\nHence, in total, 46 reports describing 20 studies\n(19 RCTs and one individual patient data \nmeta-analysis) were included in the review of\nclinical effectiveness.

The\ntotal number of participants who had a colon\nresection laparoscopically was 1800 compared with\n629 rectum resections, and 1638 participants\nreceived an open colon resection compared with\n499 open rectum resections. \nIn general, studies reported the participants\u2019 stage\nof cancer using either Dukes\u2019 or TNM\nclassification (see Appendix 8 for further details).\nOne study failed to report the stage of cancer at\nwhich participants were enrolled55 and in one\nstudy the stage was not clearly reported.3 Where\nspecified, the majority of participants receiving\neither laparoscopic or conventional open\ninterventions had either Dukes\u2019 B (TNM Stage II)\nor Dukes\u2019 C (TNM Stage III) cancer. \nThe individual patient data meta-analysis\n(Bonjer J, QE II Health Sciences Centre, Halifax,\nNS: personal communication, 2005) included\npatients from four of the above trials:\nConventional versus Laparoscopic-Assisted\nSurgery in Colorectal Cancer (CLASICC), the\nCOlon cancer Laparoscopic or Open Resection\nStudy Group (COLOR), the Clinical Outcomes of\nSurgical Therapy Study Group (COST) and Lacy\nand colleagues.2\u20134,22 [Academic-in-confidence\ninformation removed.] \nDescription of surgery received\n\u2018Opposite\u2019 method initiated\nThe \u2018opposite\u2019 method to the one to which the\npatient was randomised was initiated in \n46\/1173 (3.9%) of those randomised to\nlaparoscopic resections (Table 10).

Rates varied between\ntrials from 0 to 46%. Overall, 417 (21%)\nlaparoscopic procedures were converted to an\nopen surgery amongst 1972 allocated to\nlaparoscopic resection (Table 11). [Academic-in-\nconfidence information removed.] \nSurgeon prior experience\nTen of the RCTs reported that surgeons\nperforming the procedures were experienced in\nlaparoscopic colorectal surgery.2\u20134,22,48,50,51,53,57,59\nHowever, only three trials2\u20134 reported a minimum\nlevel of experience required to enter the trial.

None provided information\nfor the following four outcomes: seroma, visceral\nand vascular injury and long-term pain. The\nremaining outcomes are discussed in the\nsubsequent section. The results of the meta-analyses\nperformed for this review are given in Appendix 9.\nDuration of operation\nOf the 19 eligible studies, 16 (n = 4125) provided\ninformation on the duration of operation\n(Table 13). In all but one study,47 the duration of\noperation was longer in the laparoscopic group\n(Sign test, p < 0.001) and this was statistically\nsignificant (p < 0.05) in 12 studies. Only three\nstudies22,53,56 presented data in a form sufficiently\nsimilar to allow quantitative synthesis (Appendix\n9, comparison 01:01). The WMD was 40 minutes\n(95% CI 32 to 48, p < 0.001) for laparoscopic\nversus open surgery. This result is consistent\nwith the data from those trials that provided data\nnot amenable to meta-analysis (medians and\nranges, e.g. the difference in medians in the UK-\nbased CLASICC trial was 45 minutes) (Table 13).\nThere was evidence of statistical heterogeneity\nbetween the three trials in the meta-analysis, but\nthe direction of effect was consistent across the\nstudies even though the size of effect estimates\nvaried. Using a random effects model did not\nchange this pattern. The cause of the\nheterogeneity is unclear, but in the study by \nLeung and colleagues53 all participants suffered\nfrom rectal or sigmoid cancers, in that by Lacy\nand colleagues22 all participants had colon cancer\nand in that by Schwenk and colleagues56 both\ngroups were included. Furthermore, the study by\nLeung and colleagues53 had many more\nparticipants with TNM Stage IV than the other\ntwo studies.\nBlood loss\nBlood loss data were not reported in a form\nsufficiently similar to allow for a quantitative\nsynthesis (Table 14). Nine studies4,22,40,48,49,51,53,57,60\nprovided information on the quantity of blood lost\nfor patients undergoing laparoscopic or open\ninterventions. Eight studies favoured the\nlaparoscopic group4,22,40,48,49,53,57,60 and six of the\nnine studies reported a statistically significant\ndifference. Based on the Sign test, there was a\nstatistically significant difference between the two\ninterventions (p = 0.039). The largest trial that\nprovided data reported a median difference in\nblood loss of 75 ml.4 The other trials are broadly\nconsistent with this.\nAnastomotic leakage\nA total of 55 (3%) leakages were reported amongst\n1640 allocated laparoscopic resections versus 34\n(2.5%) amongst 1373 allocated open resections\n(Appendix 9, comparison 01:02: RR 1.13, 95% CI\n0.74 to 1.73, p = 0.58). The direction and size of\neffect varied across the eight studies. These results\nwere particularly influenced by the COLOR and\nCLASICC trials.3,4 The difference remained\nstatistically non-significant when colon and rectum\npatients were considered separately (Appendix 9,\ncomparison 01:20).\nAbdominal wound breakdown\nOf the 19 included studies, three reported\nabdominal wound breakdown.4,40,47 In two studies,\nthe proportion of patients who had an abdominal\nHealth Technology Assessment 2006; Vol. 10: No. 45\n15\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2006.

This result was consistent with\nthe data from those trials that reported data not\namenable to meta-analysis (Table 18). Nonetheless,\nthere was a marked heterogeneity observed in the\nmeta-analysis of this outcome, but there was\nconsistency in the direction of effect, reflecting\nvariation in the size of estimated effect across\nstudies. Using the random effects method, the\nWMD was \u20132.63 days (95% CI \u20134.82 to \u20130.44,\np = 0.02). The main source of heterogeneity\nappeared to be from the study by Zhou and\ncolleagues,60 where the average age of \nparticipants was lower than in the rest of the\nstudies included in this review. Additionally, all\nparticipants in the Zhou study had rectal cancer.\nWhen data from Zhou and colleagues were\nexcluded from the analysis, the trend towards\nlaparoscopic surgery was maintained but the WMD\nwas decreased (WMD \u20131.40, 95% CI \u20132.10 to\n\u20130.70, p < 0.0001). It should be noted that\nSchwenk and colleagues77 kept their patients in\nhospital for at least 7 days regardless of the type of\nsurgery.\nPostoperative pain \nFive studies included a measure of postoperative\npain (Table 19).3,53,57,77,82 Between the first day and\n2 weeks postoperation, four studies favoured the\nlaparoscopic group3,53,57,77 and one did not show\nEffectiveness\n20\nTABLE 19 Postoperative pain \u2013 pain scores\nStudy ID Measure Laparoscopic Open p-Value Comments\nn Pain score n Pain score\nCLASICC, 20053 EORTC QLQ-C30  526 40 268 35 NS Estimated from graph\n(pain) at 2 weeks \npostoperation\nEORTC QLQ-C30  526 21 268 19 NS Estimated from graph \n(pain) at 3 months  (back to baseline)\npostoperation\nLeung, 200453 VAS at 1 day  203 4.6 (2.4) 200 5.4 (2.3) 0.003 Mean (SD)\npostoperation\nSchwenk, 1998b77 VAS at rest at 1 day  30 17.5 (0\u201350) 30 26 (0\u201350) 0.2 Median (range)\n(Schwenk, 1998a56)postoperation\nCumulative VAS  30 161 (17\u2013729) 30 252 (123\u2013441) 0.07 Median (range)\nscore during rest for \nfirst week \npostoperation\nStage, 199757 VAS at rest at 1 day 15 15 14 16 NS Estimated from graph\npostoperation\nVAS at rest at 5 days  15 0 14 5 NS Estimated from graph\npostoperation\nVAS at rest 30 days  15 0 14 0 NS Estimated from graph\npostoperation\nWeeks, 200282 Pain distress at  203 2 (1\u20133) 198 2 (1\u20133) NS Median (IQR)\n(COST, 2004) 2 days postoperation\nPain distress at  201 1 (1\u20132) 194 1 (1\u20132) NS Median (IQR)\n2 weeks \npostoperation\nPain distress at  199 1 (1\u20131) 180 1 (1\u20132) NS Median (IQR)\n2 months \npostoperation\nEORTC QLQ-C30, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core 30 Questionnaire\n(100: better); VAS, visual analogue score (0: better); NS, not significant.any differences between the two interventions82\n(Sign test, p = 0.125). Three studies measured pain\nat 1\u20133 months postoperatively but this did not\ndiffer significantly between the two\ninterventions.3,57,82 Data were not presented in a\nform sufficiently similar to allow quantitative\nsynthesis. Results in terms of analgesic requirements\nconsistently favoured the laparoscopic group (Table\n20). In four studies, patients in the laparoscopic\ngroup required fewer days of postoperative\nanalgesia than in the open group,2,49,51,60 and this\nwas statistically significant in three. A further study\nrecorded that the number of participants in the\nlaparoscopic group requiring opioid supplements\nwas less than that required in the open group [9\/41\n(22%) versus 14\/19 (74%)].40 In another study,\npatients in the laparoscopic group required 35 mg\nless morphine in the first 48 hours as compared\nwith the open group50 (Sign test, p = 0.031).\nTime to return to usual activities\nOnly one study reported data on time to return to\nusual activities.53 This study was based in Hong\nKong and compared laparoscopic (n = 203) with\nopen surgery (n = 200) in patients with\nrectosigmoid cancer. The authors report that the\naverage time to resume household activities in the\nlaparoscopic group (mean 32 days, range\n4\u2013365 days) was lower than that in the open group\n(mean 44 days, range 7\u2013198 days, p = 0.002). \nHealth-related quality of life\nFour studies, using a variety of instruments,\nreported the quality of life of people undergoing\nlaparoscopic or open resections (Table 21).3,40,56,82\nIn three studies, the quality of life was assessed\nusing the European Organisation for Research and\nTreatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core 30\nQuestionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30).3,40,78 In one\nstudy, quality of life was measured using two\ndistinct instruments: Quality of Life Index and the\nGlobal Rating Scale.82\nThree studies reported higher quality of life\nfollowing laparoscopic surgery and in one the\nquality of life scores were similar in both the\nlaparoscopic and open groups;40 however, this was\na randomised study embedded within an\nenhanced recovery programme (Sign test,\np = 0.125). One study reports that patients\nassigned to laparoscopic surgery who were\nconverted to open showed poorer quality of life at\nbaseline and at every follow-up assessment than\npatients who underwent laparoscopic resection.82\nHealth Technology Assessment 2006; Vol. 10: No. 45\n21\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2006.

Bonjer and colleagues reported a\n\u2018time to event\u2019 meta-analysis based on individual\npatient data of four big trials: COST, CLASICC,\nCOLOR and the study conducted by Lacy and\ncolleagues22 (Bonjer J, QE II Health Sciences\nCentre, Halifax, NS: personal communication,\n2005). Figure 2 of their study is reproduced here\nas Figure 4 [Academic-in-confidence information\nremoved]. Bonjer and colleagues did not include\nall the RCTs; the data from six of the individual\nRCTs were included in a meta-analysis to\ndetermine whether the results of these studies\nwere consistent with those from Bonjer and\ncolleagues. The results of this analysis showed no\ndifference between groups (Appendix 9,\ncomparison 01:10: RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.09,\np = 0.28). The direction of effect was not\nconsistent across the studies. Four studies slightly\nfavoured laparoscopic resection2,22,48,53 and one\nslightly favoured open resection.51 The results of\nthis meta-analysis should be treated with caution\nas the length of follow-up of the RCTs varied and\nonly the proportion of deaths, not time to death,\nwas utilised. The remaining RCT was a 3-year\nfollow-up of the CLASICC trial. Only preliminary\nunpublished data from this trial were obtained; as\nthese data were supplied as academic-in-\nconfidence, they have not been included in this\nreport (Guillou PJ, University of Leeds: personal\ncommunication, 2005).\nDisease-free survival\nFive RCTs2,22,51,53 (Guillou PJ, University of Leeds:\npersonal communication, 2005) and one meta-\nanalysis (Bonjer J, QE II Health Sciences Centre,\nHalifax, NS: personal communication, 2005)\nprovided information on disease-free survival.\n[Academic-in-confidence information removed.]\nFurther data were available from the CLASICC\ntrial; however these data were preliminary and\nunpublished. As these data were supplied as\nacademic-in-confidence, they have not been\nincluded in this report (Guillou PJ, University of\nLeeds, personal communication, 2005). A meta-\nanalysis of the data provided by the remaining\nfour RCTs showed no difference in disease-free\nsurvival (Appendix 9, comparison 01:11: RR 1.01,\n95% CI 0.95 to 1.07, p = 0.83).\nRecurrence\nSeven RCTs2,22,47,48,51,53,57 and one meta-analysis\n(Bonjer J, QE II Health Sciences Centre, Halifax,\nNS: personal communication, 2005) provided\ninformation on recurrence. Considering 1528\npatients over the six trials, cancer recurrences\nappeared less frequently in the laparoscopic group\nthan in the open resection group. Two studies\nfavoured the open group51,53 and another three\nfavoured the laparoscopic group,2,22,48 but none of\nthe differences were statistically significant\n(Appendix 9, comparison 01:12: 135\/789 versus\n144\/765, RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.14, p = 0.44).\nThe results of this meta-analysis should be treated\nwith caution as the follow-ups of the RCTs ranged\nfrom 3 to 108 months. [Academic-in-confidence\ninformation removed.]\nIn terms of wound recurrence alone, there were\nonly three reported cases of wound recurrences\nacross the four studies2,51\u201353 that reported this\noutcome: two cases of wound recurrence in the\nlaparoscopic group and one in the open group2\n(Table 22).

The pattern observed in\nconversion patients for duration of operation,\nurinary tract and wound infection and overall\nsurvival was similar to that observed for both\nlaparoscopic and open resection groups.\nConverted patients, however, displayed higher\nblood loss and longer length of hospital stay. In\naddition, although lymph node retrieval was\nhigher, tumour recurrence appeared to be greater\nthan that observed for the other two groups\nsuccessfully managed according to their allocation.\nData for converted patients were limited and\ntherefore these results should be interpreted with\ncaution.\nEffect of surgeon experience\nThree trials reported the effect of surgeon\nexperience on outcomes.2\u20134 The COST trial found\nno experience-based trends for conversion, length\nof stay or quality of life measures.2,82 However, the\nCLASICC trial reported a decline in number of\nconversions by year of recruitment from 38% in\nthe first year to 16% in the sixth year.3 The\nCOLOR trial also found that the duration of\nsurgery for laparoscopic procedures reduced with\nincreasing numbers of patients per centre\n(p = 0.03), although number of lymph nodes\nharvested and length of hospital stay did not\ndiffer significantly.4\nLocation of cancer\nSubgroup analysis showed no evidence that the\ntreatment effect size for anastomotic leakages was\ndifferent for colon compared with rectal cancer.\nHowever, the evidence is limited as only two RCTs\nreported anastomotic leakages in rectal patients3,60\n(Appendix 9, colon, comparison 01:15:01: RR\n1.27, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.31, p = 0.44; rectum,\ncomparison 01:15:02: RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.63 to\n2.46, p = 0.52).\nStage of cancer\nTwo RCTs provided subgroup analysis by stage of\ncancer for overall survival.2,53 In both of these\ntrials there was no significant difference in overall\nsurvival of patients undergoing laparoscopic\nresection compared with open resection for \ncancer Stages I, II or III (p > 0.05).

[Academic-in-confidence information\nremoved.]\nAge\nNo separate data were provided in the included\nstudies to compare older and younger patients.\nSummary and conclusions of the\nevidence for and against the\nintervention\nThis update considered data from over 4500\nrandomised participants across 18 RCTs of\ngenerally good quality. The data indicate that after\nlaparoscopic resection, length of hospital stay is\nshorter, blood loss and postoperative pain are less\nand return to usual activities is likely to be faster\nthan after open resection. The duration of\noperation for laparoscopic resection is longer.\nLymph node retrieval, completeness of resection\nand quality of life do not appear to differ \nbetween the two approaches, although clinically\nimportant differences could not be ruled out. \nThe occurrence of complications such as\nanastomotic leakage, abdominal wound\nbreakdown, incisional hernia, wound and urinary\ntract infections are similar, again with wide 95%\nCIs. Operative and 30-day mortality were also\nstatistically similar in both groups. [Academic-in-\nconfidence information removed.] There was also\nno evidence of a difference in the number of\nrecurrences (including wound recurrences).\nFurthermore, after laparoscopic resection, port-site\nrecurrences were found in less than 1% of patients.\nIn this review, the results for duration of operation\nand length of stay displayed significant\nheterogeneity. Consistency in the direction of\neffect was, however, observed in the two outcomes.\nMuch of the variation might be due to differences\nin the characteristics of participants, particularly\ndifferences on patients\u2019 age and location and stage\nof cancer. In part this may have been due to the\ndifferences in the specific aims and objectives of\nthe trials, which led to important differences in\ninclusion criteria. Other likely sources of\nheterogeneity include differences in the way in\nwhich those outcomes were defined, in the\noperator experience and in the length of \nfollow-up.\nA low conversion rate is a key issue in laparoscopic\nresection as it is associated with better short-term\noutcomes. In this review, we identified that\nconverted patients have higher blood loss and\nlonger length of hospital stay. Furthermore, there\nis evidence from the CLASICC trial that\nconversion rates fall with experience.

No language restrictions were\nimposed but as this review is an update of an earlier\nreview conducted in 2000, the searching was limited\nto studies published between 2000 and 2005.\nDatabases searched were MEDLINE (2000\u2013May\nWeek 2, 2005), EMBASE (2000\u2013Week 21, 2005),\nMEDLINE Extra (23 May 2005), Science Citation\nIndex (2000\u201327 May 2005), NHS Economic\nEvaluation Database (May 2005), HTA Database\n(May 2005), Health Management Information\nConsortium (2000\u2013May 2005) and Journals@Ovid\nFull Text (2000\u2013July 2005 for selected surgical\njournals). In addition, recent conference\nproceedings and reference lists of all included\nstudies were scanned to identify additional\npotentially relevant studies. Other sources of\ninformation consulted included references in\nrelevant articles, selected experts in the field and\nreferences of consultees\u2019 submissions. Full details\nof the search strategies used are documented in\nAppendix 1.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nTo be included, studies had to compare, in terms\nof both costs and outcomes, strategies involving\nlaparoscopic and\/or HALS compared with open\nsurgery for treatment of colorectal cancer. Studies\nwere included even if they made no formal\nattempt to relate cost to outcome data in a cost-\neffectiveness or cost\u2013utility analysis. One reviewer\nassessed all abstracts for relevance and full papers\nwere obtained for those that appeared potentially\nrelevant.\nData extraction strategy\nThe following data were extracted for each\nincluded primary study using the framework\nprovided for abstracts prepared for the NHS\nEconomic Evaluation Database:105\n1.

Is it unlikely that important relevant studies\nwere missed?\n2. Were the inclusion criteria used to select\narticles appropriate?\n3. Was the assessment of studies reproducible?\nHealth Technology Assessment 2006; Vol. 10: No. 45\n27\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2006.

How reproducible are the overall results?\n6. Will the results help resource allocation in\nhealthcare?\nEach stem (1\u20136) was answered by one of the\nfollowing: \u2018Impossible to judge\u2019, \u2018No\u2019, \u2018Partly\u2019,\n\u2018Yes\u2019.\nData synthesis\nNo attempt was made to synthesise quantitatively\nthe primary studies that were identified. Data from\nall included studies were instead summarised and\nappraised in order to identify common results,\nvariations and weaknesses between studies. If a\nstudy did not report ICERs but provided sufficient\ndata, then, where possible, the data were\nreanalysed to provide estimates of ICERs. The\ndata were then interpreted alongside the results of\nthe systematic review of effectiveness so that\nconclusions could be drawn on the relative\nefficiency of the different surgical strategies. \nThe results of the systematic review of economic\nevaluations reported in this chapter were\ncompared with those drawn from the consultee\nsubmissions and similarities and differences\nhighlighted.\nWhere relevant data were available from studies\nwhich were unpublished but for which the authors\nwere seeking publication, these data have been\ntreated as academic-in-confidence and not\nreported.\nResults\nNumber of studies identified\nThe results of the literature searches are presented\nin Table 26. The number of reports retrieved from\nthe searches in the Science Citation Index and\nJournals@Ovid Full Text are the totals after\ndeduplication against the results of the\nMEDLINE\/EMBASE multifile search.\nOf the studies selected for assessment, three\nstudies53,66,109 met the inclusion criteria. Two\nadditional unpublished papers were obtained from\nexperts in the field40 (Franks PJ, Thames Valley\nUniversity: personal communication, 2005). A\nfurther study that compared laparoscopic against\nHALS and, as a consequence, did not meet the\ninclusion criteria, was also identified. However, a\nsummary of this study is provided as part of the\nsection \u2018Summary of results and discussion\u2019\n(p. 34).104\nStudy identification and key elements\nTwo studies compared laparoscopic colon resection\nwith open colon resection in the treatment of\ncolon cancer,66,109 but one of them focused on\nright hemicolectomy;109 a further study compared\nlaparoscopic-assisted with conventional open\nresection for rectosigmoid carcinoma,53 and two\ncompared laparoscopic with open resection for\ncolorectal cancer40 (Franks PJ, Thames Valley\nUniversity: personal communication, 2005). One\nof these was in the context of an enhanced\nrecovery programme.40\nFour studies were classified as cost\u2013consequence\nanalyses, that is, costs were compared with various\ndifferent measures of effectiveness. Two were\nbased on single-centre RCTs40,53 and one was\nbased on data from 10 Swedish centres.66 The\nfourth study was based on a single-centre cohort-\nmatched study conducted in China (Table 27).109\nTwo studies considered costs from a societal\nperspective40,66 whereas the others adopted a\nhospital perspective (Table 27).53,109 The fifth study\nwas described as a cost analysis (data supplied as\nacademic-in-confidence has not been presented in\nthis report) (Franks PJ, Thames Valley University:\npersonal communication, 2005).\nSystematic review of economic evaluations\n28\nTABLE 26 Results of searching for studies on cost-effectiveness\nDatabase Hits screened Selected for full assessment\nMEDLINE\/EMBASE\/MEDLINE Extra multifile search  256 28\n(after deduplication in Ovid)\nScience Citation Index 63 5\nNHS Economic Evaluation Database 5 0\nHTA Database 30 3\nHeath Management Information Consortium 35 2\nSelected from conference abstracts 3 3\nTotal 392 41The study by Franks and colleagues represented a\npreliminary analysis conducted on a subset of\npatients from the CLASICC trial who had agreed\nto be included in the economic evaluation. The\ndates for data collection were not reported. The\nSwedish study collected data from January 1999 to\nMay 2002,66 the study by King and colleagues\nfrom January 2002 to March 2004,40 the study by\nLeung and colleagues, conducted in Hong Kong,\nfrom September 1993 to October 200253 and the\nChinese study from September 2002 to February\n2003.109 In all five studies, costs were estimated\nprospectively from the same sample as that used\nfor collecting the effectiveness data40,53,66,109\n(Franks PJ, Thames Valley University: personal\ncommunication, 2005).40,53,66,109\nPatient group, study sample and study\ndesign\nThe sample sizes in four of the five studies were\nmodest (Table 27). In the cohort-matched study,\npatients with colon cancer underwent laparoscopic\nright hemicolectomy surgery and were matched\nwith patients who received open right\nhemicolectomy surgery.109 Patients for the open\nsurgery group in this study were matched for\ngender, age, Dukes\u2019 staging, tumour site, previous\nabdominal operation and extent of resection and\nrandomly selected from 87 patients who\nunderwent open surgery during the same period. \nThe analysis in all studies was conducted on an\nintention-to-treat basis; however, the follow-up\nperiod varied considerably between studies\n(Table 27). The outcome measures also varied\nbetween studies (Table 28).\nMethods of economic analysis\nThe four trial-based papers40,53,66 (Franks PJ,\nThames Valley University: personal communication,\n2005) presented details on which items were\nincluded in the cost calculations, whereas no details\nwere reported in the Chinese study.109 Relatively\ngood details of unit costs were presented in the\nSwedish and UK studies40,66 (Franks PJ, Thames\nValley University: personal communication, 2005),\nwhereas no unit costs were reported in the other\ntwo studies.53,109 Discounting was performed only in\nthe Swedish study whereas it was actually relevant in\nall studies with a follow-up greater than 12 months.\nIndirect costs were calculated in three of the studies\nusing the human capital approach (time off paid\nwork)40,60 (Franks PJ, Thames Valley University:\npersonal communication, 2005). Three papers did\nnot use any summary measure of health\nbenefits40,53,109 and left the results disaggregated.\nOne study focused on costs alone (Franks PJ,\nThames Valley University: personal communication,\n2005). In the study by Janson and colleagues, the\nmean cost for reoperated patients for each arm of\nthe trial was presented (although it is not reported\nin this chapter).66\nOne-way sensitivity analysis was performed in\nthree studies. Changes in perioperative,\nequipment, recovery, intensive care unit and\nhospital costs were considered in the study by\nFranks and colleagues (Franks PJ, Thames Valley\nUniversity: personal communication, 2005). They\nalso considered a subgroup analysis by location of\ncancer (colon or rectum). Cost per minute for the\noperating room, anaesthesia and recovery room\ntime were explored in the Swedish study66 while\nduration of in-patient stay and the consumption of\ncommunity resources after discharge were\nexplored in the study by King and colleagues.40\nResults\nThe results of the included studies are\nsummarised in Table 29.

However, in their analysis, King and\ncolleagues found that these costs were more than\noffset by lower postoperative costs such as\nreoperations and productivity cost savings resulting\nfrom the earlier return to usual activities.40\nSimilarly, the health service costs in the study by\nLeung and colleagues were also higher for\nlaparoscopic than for open surgery and this\ndifference, as with the other two RCT-based\nSystematic review of economic evaluations\n30\nTABLE 28 Outcome measures used in the included studies\nStudy ID End-points\nFranks, 2005  None specified\n(unpublished) (UK)\nJanson, 200466 (Sweden) Complication rate (e.g. anastomotic leak, bowel perforation, wound rupture, ileus,\npostoperative bleeding, incarcerated abdominal hernia, endoscopic dilation, closure loop\nileostomy)\nReoperations\nMortality\n3-year survival \nKing, 200640 (UK) Requirement of opioid analgesia\nAnti-emetic administration\nMajor morbidity (e.g. haemorrhage, anastomatic leak, wound dehiscence and sepsis requiring\nat least high-dependency support)\nHospital stay \nLength of stay for readmissions\nMortality\nLeung, 200453 (Hong Kong) Duration of operation\nBlood loss\nAnastomotic leakage\nLymph node retrieval\nCompleteness of resection\/margins of tumour clearance\nConversion\nWound infection\nUrinary tract infection\n30-day mortality\nPostoperative pain\nSurvival\nDisease-free survival\nRecurrence\nZheng, 2005109 (China) Operation time\nBlood loss\nSpecimen length \nLymph node yield\nPathological staging (Dukes\u2019 staging)\nAnalgesic requirements\nTime to flatus passage\nTime to resume normal diet \nDuration of hospitalisation\nMorbidity\nLocal recurrence rate \nMetachronous metastasis rate\nMortality\nCumulative survival probabilityanalyses, was statistically significant (p < 0.001).53\nHowever, no significant difference was observed in\nthe total cost of operation and drugs between the\ntwo groups in the Chinese study [CNY1000 (~\u00a367);\nwww.bloomberg.com, accessed 24 August 2005].109\nOverall, the magnitude of the mean additional cost\nof laparoscopic compared with open surgery varied\nconsiderably between studies. For example, the\nrelative cost of laparoscopic surgery compared with\nopen surgery varied between 95%40 and 130%.53\nThe data on the relative effectiveness of\nlaparoscopic compared with open surgery for the\nRCTs are reported in detail in Chapter 3.

The principle difference was that the\nALSGBI review included studies which involved\noutcomes not presented in a disaggregate form for\ncolorectal cancer and non-colorectal cancer\npatients. Furthermore, the ALSGBI review did not\nreport the search strategies used. However, it\nseems unlikely that any important relevant studies\nhad been missed. \nThe ALSGBI review concluded: \u201cthe operative\ncosts for laparoscopic resection of colorectal cancer\nare higher because of longer operating time and\nthe use of more expensive devices. However, these\ncosts are offset by shorter hospital stay, less use of\nanalgesia, less use of blood products and less\ncomplications in short and long term\u201d. The first\npart of this statement agrees with the findings of\nthe review reported in this chapter; however, the\ndata available from the review presented in this\nchapter do not suggest that the additional\noperative costs are offset by cost savings resulting\nfrom fewer complications and shorter length of\nstay.\nSummary of results and discussion \nIn the previous review conducted for NICE on this\nsubject, eight studies were identified.21 This review\nreported that: \u201cNo consistent patterns were found,\nwith most studies showing no significant difference\nin cost between the two procedures.

This is consistent with the data in the\nreview of effectiveness reported in Chapter 3.\nHowever, the study by Zheng and colleagues\nreported no statistically significant difference.109\nWith respect to length of hospital stay, this\nappeared to be longer in the open groups, again,\na result consistent with the review of effectiveness\nreported in Chapter 3. Overall, in terms of these\nfindings, the results of the review presented in this\nchapter are consistent with the findings of\nVardulaki and colleagues.17\nThe five articles included in this review concluded\nthat operation costs for the laparoscopic\nprocedure were statistically significantly higher\nthan those for open surgery. The mean total cost\nof laparoscopic surgery appeared to be greater\nthan that for open surgery in all studies except\nthat of King and colleagues.40 However, there was\nno evidence of a statistically significant total cost\ndifference between laparoscopic and open surgery.\nThe submission by Ethicon Endo-Surgery was a\nbrief presentation of some of the key issues in the\nconsideration of laparoscopic surgery (submission\nto NICE by Ethicon Endo-Surgery, July 2005). It\ndid not contain a systematic review or an\neconomic model. The submission concluded that\nthe long-term clinical outcomes are equivalent.\nThe evidence reported in Chapter 3 suggests that\nthis conclusion may be warranted for a 3-year\nfollow-up for survival and disease-free survival.\nThe results presented in this chapter and\nChapter 3 also tend to support Ethicon Endo-\nSurgery\u2019s conclusion of shorter recovery following\nlaparoscopic resection and that enhanced recovery\nprogramme may help to lower total costs. The\nsubmission also contended that the conversion\nrate is potentially a key driver of total cost of\nlaparoscopic surgery. The evidence supporting this\nclaim is indirect. It is likely that the total cost of\nlaparoscopic surgery is increased as conversions\nincrease although, as reported in Chapter 3, the\nevidence for comparing converted, non-converted\nlaparoscopic and open patients is limited. It is less\nclear how reducing the risk of conversion would\naffect the difference in cost when laparoscopic and\nopen surgery are compared for similar patients,\nalthough Ethicon Endo-Surgery contend that the\ncosts of laparoscopic surgery may be lower when\nthere are lower rates of conversion.\nData reporting a detailed subgroup analysis by\nlocation of disease supplied by Franks and\ncolleagues were provided as academic-in-\nconfidence and have not been included in this\nreport.\nThe incremental cost per complication avoided,\nshown in the previous section, should be\ninterpreted extremely cautiously. For example, all\nthe studies had relatively small sample sizes and\nthe differences in number of complications (used\nas effectiveness measure in these calculations)\nbetween laparoscopic and open groups were not\nstatistically significant. With respect to the\nestimates of complications, the estimates of the\nindividual studies are likely to be less reliable than\nestimates derived from the review of effectiveness.\nData from the review of effectiveness provide no\nevidence of a difference in complication rates.\nData from Franks and colleagues supplied as\nacademic-in-confidence have not been presented\nin this report. In addition, the data from Zheng\nand colleagues were for a relatively small, non-\nrandomised study which might be subjected to\nselection bias.109\nThe measure of total cost used differed\nsubstantially between studies. For example, Franks\nand colleagues (Franks PJ, Thames Valley\nUniversity: personal communication, 2005),\nJanson and colleagues66 and King and\ncolleagues40 considered indirect costs whereas the\nother two studies considered only direct costs from\nsurgery and hospital stay.53,109 The costing\nmethodology was also poorly described in these\nlast two studies. For example, Zheng and\ncolleagues reported only final cost figures and no\ndetails on the way in which calculations were\nperformed.109\nThe extent to which the costs from the three non-\nUK studies would be applicable to the UK is\nunclear. One UK study had a very small sample\nsize, and it was based on a single centre.40 Further\ndata relevant to the UK were also provided by the\nstudy by Franks and colleagues, but these data\nwere supplied as academic-in-confidence and are\nnot presented in this report. The study by Janson\nand colleagues66 was larger and the relative\ndifference in cost between the two interventions\n(see Table 29) may help inform decision-makers in\nthe UK. However, the relatively short follow-up in\nboth studies indicates that a modelling exercise\nHealth Technology Assessment 2006; Vol. 10: No. 45\n33\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2006. All rights reserved.with a longer time horizon might add valuable\ninformation for decision-making.\nIn addition to the studies comparing laparoscopic\nwith open surgery, a further study was identified\ncomparing conventional laparoscopic surgery with\nHALS.104 This study was a prospective RCT\nconducted in Barcelona, Spain. A total of 54\npatients were enrolled in the study, 27 to\nlaparoscopic and 27 to HALS. The groups were\nwell matched in terms of age, sex, body mass\nindex (BMI), location of disease, percentage of\nmalignant diagnoses and type of surgical\nprocedure. Twenty-two individuals in each group\nwere cancer patients.\nThe study found no evidence of a statistically\nsignificant difference in terms of operation time or\nconversion rates (Table 32). The authors also did\nnot find any statistically significant differences in\nterms of bowel sounds, refeeding, overall\nmorbidity rates, reoperation and hospital length\nof stay. Total costs, calculated by adding the cost of\nusing the operating room (no disposable materials\nplus salaries) to the cost of disposable instruments,\nwere also not statistically different. The authors\nconcluded, \u201cAlthough it is a more aggressive\nprocedure, HALS preserves the feature of a\nminimally invasive approach, maintains all the\noncological features of conventional laparoscopic\nsurgery, and does not increase the cost\u201d.\nConclusions\nThis chapter has presented the overall evidence\navailable on cost-effectiveness analyses of\nlaparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer\ncompared with open surgery, based on a\nsystematic review of the literature and on the\nrevision of the review submitted by the ALSGBI.\nLaparoscopic surgery was generally more costly\nthan open surgery as the former seems to involve\nlonger operation times and higher equipment\ncosts, although the evidence is mixed. With\nrespect to effectiveness, the data used by the\nindividual studies are likely to be imprecise and\nunreliable when compared with the data available\nfrom a systematic review of effectiveness (Chapter\n3). Hence, the evidence provided by the included\neconomic evaluations using longer term outcomes\nsuch as survival is likely to be imprecise and\nunreliable.\nThere is a suggestion that the short-term benefits\nof laparoscopic surgery in terms of a shorter\nrecovery may make laparoscopic surgery appear\nless costly. However, the measurement and\ninclusion of such costs (indirect costs) in an\neconomic evaluation is contentious.\nNo data were identified that compared HALS with\nopen surgery. Evidence comparing laparoscopic\nwith hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery is very\nlimited and provides no evidence for a difference\nin either costs or effects.\nSystematic review of economic evaluations\n34\nTABLE 32 Summary of results from Taragona and colleagues104\nIntervention Operation time (minutes): mean (range) Conversionsa Operation costa\nLaparoscopic (n = 27) 135 (109\u2013240) 6 \u20ac1959\u00b1593\nHALS (n =27) 120 (70\u2013300) 2 \u20ac2035\u00b1512\na No statistically significant differences.Introduction\nIn this chapter, the data available on the costs and\neffects will be used to provide information on the\nrelative cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic\ncompared with open resection for colorectal\ncancer. This has been facilitated using two\napproaches. The first compares laparoscopic with\nopen resection using a balance sheet approach\nand the second more formally synthesises the\navailable data in an economic model. With the\nbalance sheet, the differences between\ninterventions, in terms of costs and natural and\nclinical measures of effectiveness, are presented.\nSuch an approach served to highlight the choices\nand trade-offs between the two forms of resection. \nNonetheless, any decision based on the balance\nsheet approach is made using an implicit (rather\nthan an explicit) synthesis of the available data. In\nthe economic model, the disparate effects of\nsurgery for colorectal cancer are considered.\nHowever, the results of this model are tentative\nbecause, as described below, the model is\nconstrained by the paucity of data available for\nsome model parameters.\nThe balance sheet approach\nA balance sheet is a method of presenting a\ncost\u2013consequence analysis that can be used to\nidentify who bears the costs and who reaps the\nbenefits from any change in the way surgery is\nperformed. Costs and benefits are measured in\nunits that seem appropriate for each patient\nparameter. \nMethods\nEstimates of the relative effects of laparoscopic\ncompared with open resection are taken directly\nfrom Chapter 3. These data have been used to\ndescribe differences in both the short- and the\nlong-term health effects of the different forms of\nresection. Data on the costs of resection were\nderived using data reported in a paper by King\nand colleagues40 (this paper is summarised and\ncritiqued in Chapter 4) and data from the\nsystematic review of effectiveness (reported in\nChapter 3).\nThe study by King and colleagues40 defined the\ncost of resection in terms of five components\nrelevant to the perspective of the NHS (theatre\ncosts; hospitalisation costs; postoperative costs;\nchemotherapy and radiotherapy costs; and follow-\nup costs at 3 months). For each component, and\nalso for the total cost, an estimate was provided of\nthe mean value for both laparoscopic and open\nresection. In addition, an estimate of the mean\ndifference between the two forms of resection and\nthe statistical imprecision surrounding these mean\ndifferences was also provided. Using the methods\ndescribed below, the data from King and\ncolleagues were used in the re-estimation of costs\nfor laparoscopic and open resection. \nTheatre costs\nThe length of time in surgery for both\nlaparoscopic and open resection reported by King\nand colleagues40 was broadly consistent with the\nfindings of the systematic review of effectiveness.\nTherefore, the data reported for theatre costs in\nthis study were used. This makes the assumption\nthat the use of disposable equipment for\nlaparoscopic resection observed by King and\ncolleagues is typical of practice within the UK.\nThis study did not report information on the\nstatistical precision surrounding estimates of\ntheatre cost for each intervention. However they\ndid report an estimate of the variability of the\nmean difference in theatre costs. It was assumed\nthat the theatre costs of both procedures were\nsubject to this imprecision. Consequently, it was\napportioned on a pro rata basis to each\nintervention and assumed to be evenly distributed\naround the mean value using a triangular\ndistribution. The values used to estimate this\ndistribution are reported in Table 33.\nHospitalisation costs\nThe study by King and colleagues40 involved a\ncomparison of the two forms of resection in the\ncontext of an accelerated discharge scheme. It is\nlikely that the lengths of stay observed in this\nstudy may not be representative of practice within\nthe UK. Therefore, the length of stay for open\nresection was based on the mean length of stay for\nHealth Care Resource Group (HRG) 07\n(15.2 days) from the Hospital Episode Statistics112\nfor 2004, the most frequently recorded HRG for\nHealth Technology Assessment 2006; Vol. 10: No. 45\n35\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2006. All rights reserved.\nChapter 5\nEconomic evaluationcolorectal cancer resection (the other HRGs have a\nsimilar length of stay). A distribution for this\nparameter was constructed using the median length\nof stay, the only other available evidence, and the\nmean length of stay for this HRG. Using these two\npieces of data, the use of alternative distributions\nwas investigated. A Weibull distribution was chosen\nas it provided a plausible lower estimate of length\nof stay and also allowed the possibility of a\nsubstantially greater length of stay. The length of\nstay for laparoscopic resection was derived by\nadding the estimate for the weighted mean\ndifference in length of stay from the length of stay\nfor open resection. The length of stay data for both\noperations were then combined with information\non the cost per day for a surgical high-dependency\nunit (assumed 1-day stay for both procedures) and a\nsurgical ward (the remainder of the stay). Both ward\ncosts were taken from King and colleagues.40\nPostoperative costs\nThe postoperative costs estimated by King and\ncolleagues40 included the use of medications in\naddition to surgery for complications. The estimate\nfor laparoscopic resection was very much less than\nthat for open resection. This appeared to be due to\nthe higher rates of complications seen in the open\narm of the study. The evidence from the review of\neffectiveness presented in Chapter 3 showed no\nstatistically significant difference in postoperative\ncomplications. Therefore, it has been assumed that\nthe cost of open resection for this element is the\nsame as that of laparoscopic resection.\nChemotherapy and follow-up costs\nThe final two elements of total cost estimated by\nKing and colleagues40 were the costs of\nchemotherapy and radiotherapy and follow-up costs\nup to 3 months from the initial operation. Follow-up\ncosts were collected via patient-completed\nquestionnaires after 2 weeks and 3 months of follow-\nup. These questionnaires requested information on\nthe number of inpatient days, outpatient visits, GP\nvisits, use of district (community) and stoma nursing\nservices. It is unclear whether the statistically non-\nsignificant differences observed for this or any of\nthe other cost components are real or are a\nconsequence of the imprecision caused by the small\nsample size. The distributions around these\nchemotherapy and follow-up costs were estimated\nusing the same methods as described earlier for\ntheatre costs. The data used to derive these\ndistributions are also described in Table 33.\nEstimation of total costs\nTable 34 summarises the estimates of the costs of\nlaparoscopic and open resection obtained using\nthe methods described above. Monte Carlo\nsimulation employing 10,000 iterations was then\nperformed to generate a distribution for the\nincremental cost of laparoscopic compared with\nopen resection. This was conducted using the\nMicrosoft Excel add-on Crystal Ball. \nIt should be noted that these estimated costs do\nnot reflect any interactions between components\nof total cost. For example, the follow-up costs and\nthe hospital costs estimated by King and\ncolleagues40 may be correlated. This is because\nhospital costs are influenced by the number and\ntype of complications. These complications would\nalso be expected to influence follow-up costs.\nOne of the key determinants of the difference in\ncost between laparoscopic and open surgery was\nthe difference in length of stay. To consider the\nimportance of this, a threshold analysis was\nconducted to consider what difference in length of\nstay would lead to an equal cost (Figure 6).\nThe threshold analysis suggests that should\nlaparoscopic resection be associated with a length\nof stay that is on average just over 4 days less than\nopen surgery, then the costs of the two surgeries\nwould be equivalent. A difference of this\nmagnitude was rarely observed in the studies\nincluded in the review of effectiveness presented\nin Chapter 3. The analysis also indicates that\nshould the difference in length of stay reduce, as\nmay occur in an enhanced recovery programme,\nthe incremental cost of laparoscopic compared\nwith open surgery increases (to over \u00a3500 when\nthe difference in length of stay was 1 day). \nResults\nTable 35 presents the balance sheet for the\ncomparison of laparoscopic with open surgery for\ncolorectal cancer. \nAs Table 35 illustrates, after laparoscopic resection,\nlength of hospital stay is shorter, blood loss and\npersistent pain are less and return to usual\nactivities is likely to be faster than after open\nresection (although data came from one RCT\nconducted in Hong Kong53 and may not be\ngeneralisable to the UK). The duration of\noperation for laparoscopic resection is longer and\na significant number of patients are converted\nfrom laparoscopic to open resection. Findings\nrelating to overall and disease-free survival suggest\nsimilar rates of these outcomes when comparing\nlaparoscopic with open resection for a 3-year\nfollow-up. With respect to cost, although\ndifferences are non-significant, it is likely that\nEconomic evaluation\n36laparoscopic resection is associated with a modest\nincremental cost compared with open surgery. For\nother outcomes, even though there are trends\nfavouring one method of resection over another,\nthe 95% CI are sufficiently wide that clinically and\neconomically important differences cannot be\nruled out.\nOverall, it would seem likely that laparoscopic\nresection is associated with a modest additional\ncost (approximately \u00a3260), short-term benefits\nassociated with more rapid recovery, and similar\nlong-term outcomes in terms of survival and cure\nrates up to 3 years. A judgement is required as to\nwhether the findings with respect to survival and\nHealth Technology Assessment 2006; Vol. 10: No. 45\n37\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2006.

The model\nfollows a cohort of patients from their initial\noperation through their convalescence (operation\nstate) to their return to usual activities (defined in\nthe model as a \u2018disease-free\u2019 state). The patients\nmay remain in this state until they die or they\nsuffer a recurrence or metastasis and therefore\nhave a reoperation or some other form of patient\nmanagement. Conceptually the patients could\nmove between states within the model until they\nall eventually die. For the purposes of the analysis,\nhowever, the cohort of patients has been modelled\nfor a maximum of 25 years (which represents the\nmaximum survival for the majority of the patients)\nfollowing the initial operation. All costs are\npresented in UK pounds sterling for 2004 and\ncosts and benefits are discounted at 6 and 1.5%,\nrespectively.\nFollowing their initial surgery, patients could move\ninto one of the following states:\n\u25cf Disease-free.\n\u25cf Recurrence of the disease where it may be\npossible to have a second operation or some\nform of non-operative management.\n\u25cf Disease-free (after a recurrence), where a\npatient following a successful second operation\nremains until they have a second\nrecurrence\/metastasis or die.\n\u25cf Non-operable recurrence resulting in \nnon-curative management of the disease.\n\u25cf Death.\nA cost per patient for each health state in the\nMarkov model was calculated using the methods\noutlined below. The main cost components in the\nmodel are the initial operative procedure and the\ncosts of any subsequent reoperation or\nmanagement. It has been assumed that if a\nrecurrence occurred and a reoperation was\nindicated, the patient would be operated on using\nan open procedure regardless of the surgical\nprocedure they originally received. Death is the\nonly state within the model that a patient cannot\nleave (i.e. it is an absorbing state). As all general\nsurgical procedures carry some risk of\ncomplications, the costs of postoperative\ncomplications have been included but will not be\nexplicitly modelled as their effect would\nprincipally have been captured through increased\noperating times and longer hospitalisation.\nHowever, the risk of an emergency reoperation\nwithin the first few weeks after surgery has been\nexplicitly modelled, due to the additional\noperation costs incurred. Similarly, where the cost\nof managing other complications would not be\ncaptured through increased operating time and\nlength of stay, estimates of the management cost\nEconomic evaluation\n38\n\u2013200\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n01 2 3 4 5 6\nDifference in length of stay (days)\nDifference in cost (\u00a3)\nFIGURE 6 Threshold analysis on effect of differences in length of stay on costHealth Technology Assessment 2006; Vol. 10: No. 45\n39\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2006.

Thus, the model\nwill run for a maximum of 50 cycles. An outline of\nthe model is described in Appendix 13.\nEstimation of model parameters\nBaseline parameters\nWhere quantitative synthesis was possible, the\noutputs of the systematic review of effectiveness\n(Chapter 3) were presented as RRs for\ndichotomous variables and WMDs for continuous\nvariables. For these data to be incorporated into\nthe model, they needed to be combined with\nestimates of baseline rates for one of the\ninterventions. Furthermore, although it might be\nargued that such relative effect sizes are\ntransferable between settings,113 it is important to\nensure that they are applied to baseline rates that\nare applicable to the UK, so that the resultant\nabsolute differences between interventions are\nmore likely to be applicable to the UK. \nEstimation of the risk of death was based on the\nsurvival curve for open resection provided by\nBonjer and colleagues, reproduced here as\nFigure 4 (Bonjer J, QE II Health Sciences Centre,\nHalifax, NS: personal communication, 2005).\nThese data provided estimates of survival up to \n3 years post-surgery. Overall survival for open\nresection for each 6-month period up to\n36 months was estimated from these curves. From\nthese data, a mortality rate for each 6-month cycle\nlength was calculated. As interpreting rates from\nthese curves is an imprecise method, and the\nmortality rates for each 6-month period were\nsimilar, a constant mortality rate was assumed\n(Table 36).\nThe risk of recurrence of local or of metastatic\ndisease was based on data on disease-free survival\nalso provided by Bonjer and colleagues (Bonjer J,\nQE II Health Sciences Centre, Halifax, NS:\npersonal communication, 2005). These data were\nestimated using the same methods as described\nfor the risk of death described above. As with the\nrisk of death, a constant risk of recurrence was\nassumed (Table 36).\nThe risk of death following the recurrence of non-\noperative cancer was based on data derived from\nBenoist and colleagues.114 This study is a case-\nmatched study set in France, which had the aim of\ndetermining the best treatment strategy for\npatients with asymptomatic colorectal cancer and\nirresectable synchronous liver metastases. Patients\nwere recruited between 1997 and 2002 with 27\npatients being treated with chemotherapy, without\nan initial primary resection, compared with 32\npatients who were initially treated by resection of\nthe primary tumour. The 27 chemotherapy\npatients (intervention group) were matched by\nage, sex, performance status, primary tumour\nlocation, number of liver metastases, nature of\ndisease and the type of chemotherapy to the 32\npatients who underwent resection of the primary\ntumour (control group). The mean ages of the\nchemotherapy and resection groups were 61 and\n60 years, respectively. Although this study\ncurrently provides the best available data for this\nparticular subset of patients, it should be noted\nthat the very small sample size may result in\nimprecise estimates. The study setting might also\nimpact upon the generalisability of results for the\nUK as this study, set in France, may have\ntreatment regimes that differ from standard\ntreatment in the UK.\nFor the purposes of the model, the risk of death\nfor patients with inoperable cancer was based on\nthe interpretation of the survival curve for the\n\u2018chemotherapy group\u2019 from the aforementioned\nstudy.114 This population was deemed to have\nsimilar characteristics to the patients undergoing\nnon-operative management of recurrent disease\nwithin the model. The actuarial survival for the\ntime period of 24 months, divided into 6-month\nperiods, was estimated from this curve. A mortality\nrate for each 6-month cycle length was calculated\nand, from this, a constant mortality rate was\nobtained. Based on these data, a mortality rate for\ninoperable cancer with the value of 0.2 was\ncalculated and is shown in Table 36. In order to\nreflect the statistical imprecision surrounding the\noccurrence of an event, a beta distribution was\nused. This distribution was used as it has been\nargued that it provides realistic representations of\nproportions.115 For TreeAge, the \u0002 parameter\nrequired for this distribution is the number of\npatients who experienced the event of interest and\nthe \u0003 parameter is the number of patients who did\nnot experience the event. \nOther baseline parameters required for the model\nrelated to the risk of hernia, the risk of an\nemergency reoperation for a postoperative\ncomplication and the risk of a reoperation for\nrecurrent disease. The risk of hernia was identified\nas a potentially important long-term complication\nof both forms of resection. The severity and rates\nEconomic evaluation\n40of the different types of hernia (port site or main\nincision) were identified as review outcomes, as it\nwas believed that they may have differed between\nlaparoscopic and open resection. However, the\ndata available were sparse and no distinction has\nbeen drawn between the two types of hernia. The\nrate of hernia for open resection was derived from\nthe rates of hernia reported in the open arms of\nthose trials identified by the systematic review of\neffectiveness. These data were supplemented by\nrates of hernia reported in the non-randomised\nstudies included in the submission by the ALSGBI\n(ALSGBI submission to NICE, 2005). From these\ndata, the risk of hernia per cycle was estimated for\neach of the studies that provided data\n(Appendix 12). The median estimate of the risk of\nhernia per cycle was selected for use in the model\nwith a triangular distribution based on the\nestimated 25 and 75 percentile from the identified\nstudies (Table 36).\nThe risk that a patient might require an\nemergency operation for a complication of surgery\nfor colorectal cancer was allowed for within the\nmodel. Although a variety of different\ncomplications might result in the need for a\nreoperation, it was believed, based on clinical\nopinion, that the risk of reoperation for most of\nthese would be low. The risk of complications\nrequiring non-operative management was not\nexplicitly included in the model as the effect of\nthese would principally be captured through\nlonger operating times and length of stay. \nThe one complication for which it was believed\nthat a greater proportion would require an\nemergency operation was anastomotic leakage. In\nthe model, it has been assumed that the risk of an\nemergency reoperation is equal to the risk of an\nanastomotic leakage. The baseline risk of an\nanastomotic leakage was based on the rates\nreported in the open arms of those trials\nidentified by the systematic review of effectiveness\n(Appendix 12). From these data, the median\nobserved risk of anastomotic leakage was selected\nfor use in the model with a triangular distribution\nbased on the interquartile range of rates from the\nidentified studies (Table 36).\nShould the cancer recur, the patients might have a\nreoperation. Data on this risk were not available\nfrom any of the included studies. However, data\nfrom NHS Grampian suggest that out of over 300\nprocedures per year, approximately 14\u201315 are for\nrecurrence or residual disease. Based on these\ndata, a beta distribution was used to allow for\ngreater uncertainty of the point estimate. This\ndistribution was calculated as outlined above for\nthe mortality rate for inoperable cancer. \nIt should be noted that the baseline effects do not\nchange over time. \nDerivation of relative effect sizes\nData on the relative effect sizes were derived from\nthe systematic review of effectiveness and the\nmeta-analysis by Bonjer and colleagues (Bonjer J,\nQE II Health Sciences Centre, Halifax, NS:\npersonal communication, 2005). The relative\neffect size of death for laparoscopic compared with\nopen resection was derived from the estimate of \n3-year survival reported by Bonjer and colleagues.\n[Academic-in-confidence information removed.]\nThese estimates of an absolute difference were\nconverted into a relative effect size for\nlaparoscopic surgery (Table 37). The 95% CIs\naround the point estimate reported by Bonjer and\ncolleagues assumed a normal distribution. These\ndata were used to estimate a similar distribution\naround the relative effect size.\nThe relative effect size for recurrence was also\nbased on data taken from Bonjer and colleagues.\n[Academic-in-confidence information removed.]\nThe same methods used to estimate the relative\ndifference in mortality were used to estimate the\nHealth Technology Assessment 2006; Vol. 10: No. 45\n41\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2006.

This assumption was made, as it was\nbelieved that once a recurrence occurred, the\nprognosis would be the same regardless of the\ninitial method of resection.\nOther relative effect sizes were also required for\nthe model. The first of these relates to the \nRR of an emergency operation. For the same\nreason as described above, the RR for this\nparameter was based on that for anastomotic\nleakage. These data were derived from the\nsystematic review of effectiveness reported in\nChapter 3 (Table 37). The statistical imprecision\nsurrounding the point estimate was characterised\nby log-normal distributions for RRs due to \nthe methods used to derive these relative \neffects. \nTwo other relative effect sizes required for the\nmodel are the RR of hernia and the RR of a\nreoperation after a recurrence. In both cases an RR\nof one has been assumed. In the former case, the\nevidence from the review of effectiveness is limited\nbut there is no statistically significant difference\nbetween the rates of both types of hernia. In the\nlatter case, an RR of one has been assumed as it is\nbelieved that the initial method of resection would\nnot affect the method of management subsequent\nto a recurrence (Table 37).\nTable 37 details the point estimates of the relative\neffect sizes used in the model. Also included in the\ntable are the 95% CIs surrounding the point\nestimates and distributions used. It should be\nnoted that a further assumption has been made\nthat the relative effects do not change over time. \nResource use and costs\nThe main cost component included in the model\nis the costs associated with the initial operation.\nThe method used to derive the cost for open\nresection is described in the section \u2018Methods\u2019\n(p. 37). A triangular distribution for the cost of\nopen resection was used to help evaluate the\nuncertainty around this cost estimate. The cost of\nlaparoscopic resection was estimated by\nmultiplying the cost of open resection with an\nestimate of the relative cost of laparoscopic\nresection (i.e. the cost of open resection plus the\ndifference in cost between laparoscopic and open\nresection; the product of this was then divided by\nthe cost of open surgery). A Monte Carlo\nsimulation using 10,000 iterations was conducted\nusing the Excel add-on Crystal Ball to create a log-\nnormal distribution around the relative difference\nbetween laparoscopic and open resection. The\nchoice of a log-normal distribution was made\nempirically as this distribution appeared to best fit\nthe data from the Monte Carlo simulation. \nThe cost of surgical resection would be incurred in\nthe first cycle of the model. Other costs would also\nbe incurred in this cycle relating to the cost of\nemergency surgery and the cost of an outpatient\nvisit and computed tomography (CT) scan at\n6 months (other outpatient visits might be made\nin the first cycle but these have been subsumed\ninto the cost of surgical resection). The cost of\nemergency surgery was taken from the National\nReference Costs for HRG F42 (a general\nabdominal, very major or major procedure).116\nEconomic evaluation\n42\nTABLE 37 Relative effect sizes used in the modela\nParameter Point estimate Limits of 95% CI Distribution\nLow High\nTransition probabilities\nMortality 1.016 0.958 1.054 Normal\nRecurrence 0.993 0.943 1.06 Normal\nMortality (non-curative cancer) 1 1\nOther probabilities\nEmergency operation rate 1.13 0.74 1.73 Log-normal\nRisk of hernia 1 1 1\nReoperation rate (after recurrence) 1 1 1\na Absolute parameter values for each intervention were derived by applying the relative effect sizes to estimates of the\nabsolute rate for open resection (Table 36) with the relative rates reported in this table.A triangular distribution was defined for this \ncost based on the interquartile range of costs\nreported for this HRG (Table 38). The cost of an\noutpatient visit made at 6 months was based on\nthe unit cost reported by King and colleagues.40\nThe cost of a CT scan was taken from the National\nReference Costs and a distribution for this cost was\ndefined using the same method as used for\nemergency surgery.\nFor patients who are disease free, regular review is\nperformed. Based on clinical guidelines,117 it was\nassumed that patients would receive a CT scan\nand outpatient visit at 12 and 24 months\npostoperatively. Patients would also be reviewed\nand undergo colonoscopy after 3 years and then\nsubsequent colonoscopy every 5 years, until aged\napproximately 70 years. The cost of a colonoscopy\nwas taken from the National Reference Costs and\nbased on HRG F35 (an endoscopic or\nintermediate procedure for the large intestine).\nThe distribution for this cost was defined using\nthe same method as used for emergency surgery.\nAs costs in this state are likely to be incurred\nseveral times over the course of a patient\u2019s life, a\ntable was constructed in TreeAge to allow these\ncosts to be taken account of at the given time\npoint at which they were incurred. The limitation\nof using a table to define these costs, however, is\nthat the uncertainty surrounding these cost\nestimates cannot be explored as distributions\ncould not be incorporated into the costs in the\ntable.\nThe cost of a hernia repair was likewise based on\nthe National Reference Costs. The cost used\nrelated to HRG F72 (abdominal hernia procedures\nat age less than 70 years) and a distribution for\nthis cost was defined using the same method used\nfor emergency surgery (Table 38).\nThe cost of care for patients who suffered \nsome degree of recurrent cancer would, of \ncourse, be dependent upon the nature of the\ndisease. Should further surgery be indicated,\nit has been assumed that it would cost the same \nas the initial open surgical resection as, based \non expert opinion, it was deemed unlikely that \nany reoperation would be performed\nlaparoscopically. In addition to the cost of a\nreoperation, patients might receive medications\nfor the control of symptoms if surgery was not\nindicated. The cost for a typical regime of care for\na patient was defined following consultation with a\nMacmillan Cancer Nurse (O\u2019Dea F, Hospital\nSpecialist Palliative Care Team, Grampian\nUniversity Hospital NHS Trust: personal\ncommunication, 2005) (Table 38). Details of the\nbasis of the cost estimated are provided in\nAppendix 12.\nEstimation of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)\nNo suitable utility data required to estimate\nQALYs were identified in any of the economic\nevaluations identified in Chapter 4.

However, despite this search, few usable\ndata were identified. The CLASICC Trial, which\nhas not yet fully reported, is using the EQ-5D\ninstrument collected at baseline, 2 weeks and 3, 6,\n18 and 36 months postoperation. These data will\nbe collected from the first 500 patients\nrandomised to the trial (approximately 340\nlaparoscopic and 170 conventional patients). \nUntil such data are obtained, reliable utilities \ndata applicable to the UK will not be available. In\nthe interim, data were taken from one published\nstudy which has used the EQ-5D questionnaire.119\nThis study was conducted in Norway and \nrecruited 95 patients from 1993 to 1996. The \naim of the study was to assess the cost-effectiveness\nof adjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of\nDukes\u2019 B and C colorectal cancer after surgical\nresection. The quality of life of the participants\nwas assessed using a questionnaire which included\nthe EQ-5D questionnaire, a simple quality of life\nscale and the global quality of life measure of the\nEORTC QLQ-C30. It reported a median quality of\nlife value of 0.83 (0\u20131 scale) in all patients and\nmeasures. From these limited data, assuming that\nthe recovery from surgery was associated with a\nvalue of 0.83, it has been assumed that by\ndefinition the time spent free from disease is\nassociated with a value of one. The value\nassociated with the other states (except death) was\nalso 0.83. As such data are very limited, the\nestimates of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)\nshould be treated with caution.\nAssessment of cost-effectiveness\nThe base-case analysis was based on the costs and\noutcomes faced by a cohort of 65-year-olds (the\nmean age of patients receiving a surgical resection\nof colorectal cancer in England and Wales). Within\nthe economic model, two different outcomes are\npresented: the incremental cost per additional life-\nyear and the incremental cost per QALY. Data on\nthese two outcomes are presented in two ways.\nFirst, mean costs, life-years or QALYs for the\nalternative interventions are presented and\nincremental cost per additional life year or QALYs\ncalculated where appropriate. The second way in\nwhich the cost-effectiveness of the alternative\ninterventions is presented is in terms of cost-\neffectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs).120\nCEACs have been used to illustrate the uncertainty\ncaused by the statistical variability in the model\u2019s\nparameter estimates. These curves illustrate the\nlikelihood that a strategy is cost-effective at various\nthreshold values for society\u2019s willingness to pay for\nan additional life-year or QALY. \nSensitivity analysis and subgroup\nanalysis\nSensitivity analysis focused on varying assumptions\nor parameters in the base-case model.\nAssumption of equal survival and disease-free\nsurvival\n[Academic-in-confidence information removed.]\nOne interpretation of all the evidence available on\noverall survival and disease-free survival is that\nthere is no difference between laparoscopic and\nopen resection. In this analysis, it has been\nassumed that the relative effect size for these two\nparameters is one. There is, of course, some\nuncertainty surrounding this and a similar\ndistribution to that used in the base-case analysis\nhas been used.\nUse of pooled estimate for relative difference in\nsurvival and disease-free survival from meta-\nanalysis conducted as part of review of\neffectiveness\nAs part of the systematic review of effectiveness, a\npooled analysis of outcomes of interest was\nconducted where data allowed it. Two such pooled\nestimates were derived for overall survival and\ndisease-free survival. As such, it was therefore\npossible to conduct a sensitivity analysis using\nthese estimates in place of those provided by\nBonjer and colleagues (Bonjer J, QE II Health\nSciences Centre, Halifax, NS: personal\ncommunication, 2005). From the meta-analysis\nconducted as part of the review of effectiveness,\nthe relative effective sizes in terms of mortality\nand recurrence rates for laparoscopic compared\nwith open resection were 0.97 (SD 0.03) and 0.99\n(SD 0.03), respectively. Given the nature of the\ndata, a normal distribution was assigned to the\nparameters. \nCosts\nSource of cost data\nData regarding the costs of procedures were made\navailable from other sources. This sensitivity\nanalysis explored the cost estimates for\nlaparoscopic and open surgical procedures for\ncolorectal cancer from an unpublished paper by\nFranks and colleagues (Franks PJ, Thames Valley\nUniversity: personal communication, 2005). This\npaper is a cost-analysis and reports cost data for a\nsubset of the patients entered into the CLASICC\ntrial; the paper is summarised and critiqued in\nChapter 4. The method used to derive the cost for\nopen resection was the same as the method used\nto determine the costs for the base-case analysis\ndescribed in the section \u2018Methods\u2019 (p. 35). The\nfirst sensitivity analysis, with regard to this cost\nEconomic evaluation\n44data, utilised the revised costs estimated from\nFranks and colleagues. A second sensitivity\nanalysis was performed using the WMD in length\nof stay reported in Chapter 3, which was applied\nto the length of stay for open resection from\nFranks and colleagues. The data used to conduct\nthis sensitivity analysis was supplied as academic-\nin-confidence and has not been included in this\nreport.\nAdditional cost data\nCurrently, the cost data have not taken into\naccount the extra cost which preoperative\npreparation for laparoscopic resection might incur\nand essentially assume that the same approach is\nused for both methods of resection. These costs\ncould include such aspects as the necessity for a\nCT scanner for preoperative staging as opposed to\nan ultrasound scanner. This sensitivity analysis\nassessed the impact on cost of extra assessment\nwhich may be required to determine suitable\nlaparoscopic candidates. All patients treated \nby laparoscopic resection are assumed to incur an\nadditional cost of a CT scan to allow for\npreoperative staging and all patients whose\nresection was undertaken via the open method are\nassumed to incur the additional cost of an\nultrasound scan preoperatively. The cost of \nan ultrasound scan was taken from the National\nReference Costs. A triangular distribution was\ndefined for this cost based on the interquartile\nrange of costs reported for this HRG. The mean\ncost was \u00a332 with an interquartile range of\n\u00a326\u201339.\nChanges to the reoperation rate for recurrent\ndisease\nAn estimate of the number of reoperations that\nmight take place given recurrent disease was based\non data from one centre (5%). As a result, the\nreoperation rate was changed in the sensitivity\nanalysis to either a \u2018high\u2019 rate of 10% or a \u2018low\u2019\nrate of 1%. The distributions surrounding this\nparameter remained similar. \nChanges to the relative effect size of the\nreoperation rate for recurrent disease\nNo data were available to identify the difference in\nreoperation rates between laparoscopic resection\nand open resection. The base-case analysis\nassumed that the relative effect size for this\ndifference would be one as it was deemed unlikely\nthat the initial method of resection would affect\nmanagement subsequent to a recurrence. As this\nestimate was based solely on expert opinion, this\nsensitivity analysis allowed the relative effect size\nfor the rate of reoperation to change from 0.5 to\ntwo. Hence the rate of reoperation for\nlaparoscopic resection, in comparison with open\nresection, was made to decrease to half the rate\nand increase to double the rate of open resection.\nA similar distribution to that used in the base-case\nanalysis was used.\nCombination of previous two analyses\nThe relative effect size for the reoperation rate for\nrecurrent disease was assumed to be one in the\nbase-case analysis. This analysis combines the high\nand low estimates of rates of reoperation from the\nprevious sensitivity analysis with different\nestimates of the relative effect size of the\nreoperation rate for laparoscopic compared with\nopen resection. The low reoperation rate (1%) was\ncombined with a relative effect size of 0.5. The\nhigher reoperation rate (10%) was combined with\na relative effect size of two. Similar distributions to\nthose used in the base-case analysis were used.\nChanges to the rate of mortality for non-\noperative management of recurrent disease\nThe risk of death for patients with non-operative\nrecurrent disease was based on the interpretation\nof the survival curve from the study by Benoist\nand colleagues.114 A constant mortality rate of 0.2\nwas used for the base-case analysis; however, the\nmortality rate at 6-monthly intervals was also\nestimated from the 24-month study period. This\nanalysis uses the high and low values for the\nmortality rate for non-operative management of\nrecurrent disease, 0.31 and 0.11, respectively. A\ndistribution similar to that used in the base-case\nanalysis was utilised. \nChanges to the relative effect size of mortality\nfor non-operative management of recurrent\ndisease\nThe mortality rates for patients receiving non-\noperative management for recurrent disease were\nassumed to be the same for the two interventions\nas it was deemed unlikely that the initial method\nof resection would affect this rate of mortality. The\nrelative effect size was therefore assumed to be one\nin the base-case analysis. This analysis considered\nthe implications of a relative effect size of 0.5 or\n1.5, meaning that the mortality rate for patients in\nthe laparoscopic arm could decrease by 50% and\nincrease by 50% in comparison with patients in the\nopen arm. A relative rate of two (as opposed to\n1.5) was not calculated as mortality became\ngreater than one.\nCombination of previous two analyses\nThe relative effect size for the mortality of non-\noperative management of recurrent disease was\nHealth Technology Assessment 2006; Vol. 10: No. 45\n45\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2006.

This\nanalysis combines the high and low estimates of\nsurvival from the previous sensitivity analysis with\nhigh and low estimates of the relative effect size of\nmortality for laparoscopic compared with open\nresection. The low mortality rate of 0.11 was\ncombined with a relative effect size of 0.5. The\nhigher mortality rate, 0.31, was combined with a\nrelative effect size of 1.5. A similar distribution to\nthat used in the base-case analysis was also used. \nChanges to the rate of hernia\nNo specified rate for the occurrence of hernias\nassociated with laparoscopic resection could be\nfound. The relative effect size of a hernia for\nlaparoscopic compared with open resection was\nassumed to be one. This analysis allowed the\nrelative effect size for the rate of reoperation to\nchange from 0.5 to two. Thus, the rate of hernia\nfollowing laparoscopic surgery, in comparison with\nopen surgery, was made to decrease to half the\nrate and increase to double the rate. \nUtilities\nUse of alternative data to estimate QALYs\nAlthough utilities data required to estimate QALYs\nwere sparse, alternative data were identified by\nPetrou and Campbell.121 This study aimed to test\nthe hypothesis that when stabilisation of disease\n(colorectal cancer) is achieved, chemotherapy can\nbring positive quality of life benefits. These data\nwere derived from the responses of 30 nurses in\nthe UK experienced in the oncological care of\ncolorectal cancer patients. The nurses, acting on\nbehalf of patients, assessed the values of various\nhealth states associated with the treatment of\nmetastatic colorectal cancer. The health states\ndefined by Petrou and Campbell,121 and those\ndefined within the model, are shown in Table 39.\nTwo variations for the value of non-operative\nmanagement were used (progressive disease and\nterminal disease) to assess what difference these\nalternative values might make to the results.\nFurther to the above sensitivity analysis, a second\nsensitivity analysis using utility data from a\nrecently published NICE appraisal, which\naddressed the use of oxaliplatin and capecitabine\nfor the adjuvant treatment of colon cancer, has\nalso been included to ascertain what differences in\nQALY values might be apparent.122 Utility\nestimates for patients with Dukes\u2019 Stage III colon\ncancer were sought as part of the systematic \nreview and the estimates used in the assessment \nof quality of life for this report are shown in \nTable 40. It should be noted that the utility values\nused for the analysis carried out by Pandor and\ncolleagues are from a number of sources and \ntheir usefulness is discussed in the aforementioned\nreview by Pandor and colleagues.122 As in the\nprevious analysis, two variations for the value of\nnon-operative management were used (\u2018adjuvant\nchemotherapy without side-effects\u2019 and \u2018on\npalliative chemotherapy\u2019) to assess what difference\nEconomic evaluation\n46\nTABLE 39 Alternative utility values (1)\nUtilities Value\nHealth states defined by Petrou and Campbell121 Health states defined within the economic model\nBest possible health Disease-free and disease-free after successfully treated  100\nrecurrence\nWorst possible health Dead 0\nStable disease Initial operation and recur  95\nProgressive disease (PD) Non-operative management (1) 57.5\nTerminal disease (TD) Non-operative management (2) 10\nTABLE 40 Alternative utility values (2)\nUtilities Value\nHealth states defined by NICE Assessment Report Health states defined within the economic model\nIn remission Initial operation, recurrence, disease-free and disease-\nfree after successfully treated recurrence  0.92\nOn palliative chemotherapy Non-operative management (1) 0.24\nOn adjuvant chemotherapy (without significant  Non-operative management (2) 0.70\nside-effects)these alternative values might make to the results.\nIt should be noted that these utility estimates\nshould be treated with care as the study\npopulation does not include surgical patients or\npatients with Dukes\u2019 Stage I or II cancer. Further,\nthe study population for this review only refers to\npatients with colon cancer, therefore excluding\nrectal cancer.\nSubgroup analysis\nThe model parameters, with respect to survival\nand disease-free survival, were adjusted in order to\nestimate relative cost-effectiveness for patients\ngiven their stage of cancer. In terms of stage of\ndisease, few stage-dependent data were available;\nhowever, the meta-analysis conducted by Bonjer\nand colleagues (Bonjer J, QE II Health Sciences\nCentre, Halifax, NS: personal communication,\n2005) provided some limited data by stage which\nwere modelled to illustrate the impact that\ndifferent stages of disease might have on\nrecurrence and mortality rates. Estimation of the\nrisk of death was based on the survival curves from\nBonjer and colleagues for patients with Stages I, II\nand III disease for both open and laparoscopic\nresection, [Academic-in-confidence information\nremoved]. These data provided estimates of\nsurvival up to 3 years post-surgery. Overall survival\nfor each 6-month period up to 36 months was\nestimated from these curves. From these data, a\nmortality rate for each 6-month cycle length was\ncalculated. A constant mortality rate was assumed\nbased on the mean value at each 6-month time\nperiod.\nEstimation of the risk of recurrence, either local or\nmetastatic disease, was based on data on disease-\nfree survival for Stages I, II and III, also provided\nby Bonjer  and colleagues (Bonjer J, QE II \nHealth Sciences Center, Halifax, NS: personal\ncommunication, 2005). These data were estimated\nusing the same methods as for the risk of death\ndescribed above. As with the risk of death, a\nconstant risk of recurrence was assumed.\n[Academic-in-confidence information removed.]\nNo CIs were provided by Bonjer and colleagues,\nhence, distributions allowing the uncertainty\nsurrounding these parameters could not be\nexplored. The results, therefore, are expressed\npurely as a deterministic analysis. \nResults\nThe results of the deterministic analyses of\nincremental cost per life-year and incremental cost\nper QALY are reported in Tables 41 and 42,\nrespectively. \nLaparoscopic resection is dominated by open\nresection over the 25-year time horizon\nconsidered. The point estimates of the\nincremental cost-effectiveness provided in\nTables 41 and 42 do not provide any indication of\nthe uncertainty that surrounds the model\nparameters. The uncertainty surrounding the\nprecision of many of the parameter estimates is\nreflected in the likelihood that the two surgical\ninterventions are cost-effective at different\nthreshold values for society\u2019s willingness to pay for\na life-year and a QALY.

An alternative\ninterpretation of the data on survival and disease-\nfree survival is that there are no meaningful\ndifferences (see Figure 4 and results of meta-\nanalysis reported in Chapter 3). Figures 10 and 11\nreport alternative analyses for life years and\nQALYs respectively that make this assumption.\nAs Figures 10 and 11 illustrate, the likelihood that\nlaparoscopic surgery might be considered cost-\neffective is very similar to the likelihood that open\nsurgery would be considered cost-effective. \nThe estimates of QALYs for the analysis presented\nin Figures 9 and 11 do not capture the QALY gain\nthat might be associated with an earlier recovery.\nSome indication of the relevance of any QALY\nobtained associated with earlier recovery can be\nobtained by looking at what value for this QALY\ngain is implied should it be judged that\nlaparoscopic surgery was worthwhile. Assuming a\nthreshold value for society\u2019s willingness to pay for\na QALY of \u00a330,000 and given the mean\nincremental cost of laparoscopic surgery of \u00a3263\n(base-case analysis) and \u00a3290 (equal mortality and\ndisease-free survival), then the implied value of\nthe QALY gain would need to be 0.009 and 0.010,\nrespectively. In a comparison between laparoscopic\nand open hernia repair, the observed gain in\nQALYs was 0.006 at 3 months.123\nSensitivity analysis\nUse of pooled estimate for relative difference in\nmortality and recurrence from meta-analysis\nconducted as part of review of effectiveness\nThe use of the pooled estimates from the\nsystematic review of effectiveness led to\nlaparoscopic surgery having a much greater\nchance of being considered cost-effective.\nLaparoscopic surgery was found to be more costly\n(by approximately \u00a3300) but more effective (see\nTable 43 for life-years and Table 44 for QALYs).\nAlternative and additional costs data\nChanges surrounding the use of alternative cost\ndata provided by a draft paper from a subset of\nEconomic evaluation\n48\n0 5000 10,000 15,000 20,000 25,000 30,000 35,000 40,000 45,000 50,000\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nP\nrobability cost-effective (%)\nCeiling ratio (\u00a3)\nLaparoscopic\nOpen\nFIGURE 8 CEACs showing society\u2019s willingness to pay for a life-year for the comparison of laparoscopic with open surgery (base-case\nanalysis)Health Technology Assessment 2006; Vol. 10: No. 45\n49\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2006.

In the first sensitivity analysis\nusing estimates from Franks and colleagues\n(Franks PJ, Thames Valley University: personal\ncommunication, 2005), cost data for the two\ninterventions were re-estimated using the methods\ndescribed in the section \u2018Sensitivity analysis and\nsubgroup analysis\u2019 (p. 44). The second sensitivity\nanalysis used the cost estimates for open resection\nfrom Franks and colleagues but utilised the\ndifference in length of stay between open and\nlaparoscopic surgery from the review of\neffectiveness. The results of these sensitivity\nanalyses were based on data supplied as academic-\nin-confidence and have not been presented in this\nreport.\nA cost analysis taking into account the cost for\npreoperative staging of disease with respect to\neach intervention was also performed [see the\nsection \u2018Sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis\u2019\n(p. 44)]. An increased difference in cost of \u00a340\nbetween laparoscopic and open resection was\nobserved and relatively little impact on the\nlikelihood that laparoscopic resection would be\nconsidered cost-effective (see Table 43 for life-years\nand Table 44 for QALYs). This is as would be\nexpected given the difference in cost for these two\nimaging modalities (\u00a373 for a CT scan and \u00a332 for\nan ultrasound scan; taken from the National\nReference Costs).\nChanges in the rates of reoperations\nChanging the rate at which patients with recurrent\ncancer receive a further surgical resection had\nlittle effect on cost-effectiveness in comparison\nwith the base-case analysis (Table 45 for life-years\nand Table 46 for QALY results). This would be\nexpected given the similarities in mortality and\ndisease-free survival along with the assumption of\nno difference in reoperation rates between the two\nsurgical approaches. Changing the RR of a\nreoperation was shown to influence markedly the\nlikelihood that laparoscopic surgery would be cost-\neffective. For example, adopting an RR of 0.5 (i.e.\npatients originally receiving laparoscopic surgery\nare less likely to be operated on for recurrent\ndisease than patients who originally receive an\nopen surgery) reduced the likelihood that\nlaparoscopic surgery would be considered cost-\neffective.

A\nfurther sensitivity analysis was conducted to\nexamine the interaction between the baseline risk\nof a reoperation and the relative risk of\nreoperation (Table 45 for life-years and Table 46 for\nQALY results). Allowing a higher rate of\noperations for recurrent disease and increasing\nthe chance that patients who originally received\nlaparoscopic surgery would receive an operation\nfor any recurrent disease would greatly increase\nthe likelihood that laparoscopic resection would be\nconsidered cost-effective. Given the model\nassumptions, this is as would be expected. \nNon-operative mortality rates for recurrent\ndisease\nAs might be expected, changes in the baseline\nlevel of mortality associated with recurrent disease\nhad little effect on the likelihood that laparoscopic\nsurgery would be considered cost-effective\n(Table 47 for life-years and Table 48 for QALY\nresults). The model was highly sensitive to the\nassumption that survival for patients in the state of\nnon-operative management of recurrent disease\nwould in any way be influenced by the choice of\ninitial surgery. Combining changes in the baseline\nlevel of non-operative mortality and in the RR\nbetween laparoscopic and open surgery provided a\nsimilar finding to changes in RR alone (Table 47\nfor life-years and Table 48 for QALY results).\nRisk of hernia\nOne area where limited data were available was on\nthe risk of hernia (and on other morbidities\nassociated with the method of surgery). Even\nassuming a 50% fewer or twice the number of\nhernias occurring after open surgery, little effect on\nthe cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic surgery was\nshown. This was because the baseline risk of hernia\nwas low and the only impact on cost-effectiveness\nwas through cost, that is, the incidence and\ntreatment of a hernia had no effect on utility (Table\n49 for life-years and Table 50 for QALY results). \nAlternative utility values\nThe data available on utilities were very limited\nbut some alternative utility values were available\nfrom Petrou and Campbell121 and also from a\nrecently published NICE appraisal review.122 As\ndescribed in the section \u2018Sensitivity analysis and\nsubgroup analysis (p. 44), values were available for\nthe health states in the model (although data\nrelevant to recovery from surgery and longer term\nmorbidities associated with the method of surgery,\nsuch as hernias, were not available). However, two\nalternative values were available for non-operative\nmanagement from Petrou and Campbell.121 In the\nfirst sensitivity analysis, non-operative\nmanagement was assigned the value estimated by\nthis study for progressive disease.121 In this\nanalysis laparoscopic surgery was still dominated\nby open surgery but was associated with a slightly\nhigher probability of being considered cost-\neffective (Table 51). In the second analysis, non-\noperative management was assigned the value\nestimated by Petrou and Campbell for terminal\ndisease.121 In this analysis, laparoscopic surgery\nwas again dominated but slightly more likely to be\nconsidered cost-effective in comparison with the\nanalysis using the value for progressive disease.\nThe reason for this is that, in the base-case\nanalysis, patients receiving open surgery have a\nslightly worse disease-free survival compared with\nlaparoscopic surgery. Hence they are more likely\nto spend time in this state and incur the lower\nutilities associated with this state.\nFurther alternative utility data taken from the\nNICE appraisal regarding the use of oxaliplatin\nand capecitabine on the treatment of patients with\nStage III colon cancer also provided alternative\nestimates of utility values to allow further\nestimation of QALYs.122 Two separate values for\nthe non-operative management of recurrent\ndisease were, again, used within the model as\noutlined in the section \u2018Sensitivity analysis and\nsubgroup analysis (p. 44). The first sensitivity\nanalysis using utilities from this review used the\nlow rate of 0.24 for the non-operative\nmanagement state (Table 51). This state related to\nthose on palliative chemotherapy from the NICE\nreview. In this analysis, laparoscopic surgery was\nstill dominated by open surgery and the difference\nin QALYs between the two interventions remained\nsimilar to the results using utility values from\nPetrou and Campbell.121 This serves to highlight\nthat the only factor driving these differences is\nthat of the small differences in survival and\ndisease-free survival at 3 years. The number of\nQALYs gained in this analysis for both\ninterventions are, however, less than those using\ndata from Petrou and Campbell.121 This is because\nthe values for the disease-free state and disease-\nfree after a successfully treated recurrence state\nwere assumed to have the same value as that for\nthe initial operation and for recurrence, that is,\nthey were not assumed to be in full health with a\nutility score equal to one and so could not incur\nthe higher utility when in these states. The results\nfrom the second sensitivity analysis using the utility\nvalues from the NICE review used a value of 0.7\nEconomic evaluation\n54Health Technology Assessment 2006; Vol. 10: No. 45\n55\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2006.

Once again,\nlaparoscopic resection is dominated by open\nresection and is slightly less likely to be considered\ncost-effective in comparison with the value for\npalliative chemotherapy. This is due to the fact that\npatients receiving open surgery have a slightly\nworse disease-free survival compared with\nlaparoscopic surgery and are therefore more likely\nto spend time in the non-operative management\nstate. Hence they have a greater chance of accruing\nthe extra QALYs associated with this state when it\nhas the higher utility value of 0.7.\nResults of subgroup analysis\nA deterministic analysis was performed to assess\nthe cost-effectiveness for each intervention by\nstage of cancer (Table 52 for life-years and Table 53\nfor QALYs). The input parameters for mortality\nand recurrence, by stage of disease, were obtained\nfrom the survival curves taken from Bonjer and\ncolleagues (Bonjer J, QE II Health Sciences\nCentre, Halifax, NS: personal communication,\n2005) [Academic-in-confidence information\nremoved]. The results are limited and do not\nreflect the degree of statistical uncertainty which\nmight surround the mortality and recurrence\nparameters [Academic-in-confidence information\nremoved], although some difference in mean costs\nand effects between the stage of disease can be\nseen from the results in Table 52 for life-years and\nTable 53 for QALYs. Curiously, for both life-years\nand QALYs, it appears that patients with Stage III\ndisease, treated laparoscopically, actually had\nimproved overall and disease-free survival\ncompared with open patients, as this was the only\ninstance where neither intervention clearly\ndominated the other. The results for patients with\nStage I disease are broadly consistent with the\nbase-case analysis with a similar cost and quality-\nof-life difference between the two interventions\n(Table 52 for life-years and Table 53 for QALYs).\nPatients with Stage II colorectal cancer appear to\nHealth Technology Assessment 2006; Vol. 10: No. 45\n59\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2006.

The\nevidence from the subgroup analysis performed is\ninconclusive and appears not to be consistent with\nthis assumption. The data used to allow this\nanalysis should be treated with caution and further\nrandomised evidence and\/or meta-analyses with\ndata on stage-dependent outcomes is warranted\nfor any conclusions to be reached with regard to\nthe suitability of laparoscopic candidates by stage\nof disease.\nSummary of evidence on \ncost-effectiveness\nThe results presented in the balance sheet suggest\nthat if it is assumed that there is no difference in\nlong-term outcomes, then a judgement is required\nas to whether the shorter recovery associated with\nlaparoscopic resection is worth the additional cost\nof \u00a3250\u2013300 per patient. Preliminary results from\nthe cost analysis conducted within the CLASICC\ntrial were supplied as academic-in-confidence and\nhave not been presented in this report.\nThe available data were explicitly synthesised in\nan economic model. In the base-case of this\nmodel, and almost all of the sensitivity analyses\n(making many of the same assumptions about\nsurvival and disease-free survival as the base-case\nanalysis), laparoscopic surgery was dominated (i.e.\nno more effective but more costly) by open\nsurgery. However, the likelihood that laparoscopic\nsurgery might be considered cost-effective varied\nbetween 30 and 50%, regardless of whether\noutcomes were measured in life-years or QALYs. If\nan assumption was made of equal survival and\ndisease-free survival, then the mean estimates of\nincremental cost-effectiveness still suggest that\nlaparoscopic surgery is dominated by open surgery\nalthough, as costs and outcomes are similar, both\napproaches had a similar likelihood of being\nconsidered cost-effective.\nA major concern with this analysis is that few data\nwere available on the utilities. More importantly,\nthe model fails, because of lack of data, to include\nthe QALY gain that might be associated with an\nearlier recovery following laparoscopic surgery.\nThe implied value of the QALY gain would need\nto be 0.009 and 0.010, respectively. In a\ncomparison between laparoscopic and open groin\nhernia repair, the observed gain in QALYs was\n0.006.123 It could be argued that as open resection\nof colorectal cancer involves a larger incision than\nopen repair of inguinal hernia, the magnitude of\nQALY gain for laparoscopic compared with open\nresection might be greater than that observed for\nhernia repair. What this fundamentally illustrates\nis that relatively small differences in QALYs may,\nin strict economic terms, be key to conclusions.\nThis is especially the case when it is remembered\nthat a single day in full health is equal to 0.00274\nQALYs. \nSimilarly, few data were available on morbidities\nassociated with the method of surgery, such as\nhernia and persisting pain. The risk of such\noutcomes along with their associated management\ncosts and utilities may, as with the evaluation of\nsurgery for inguinal hernia,124 be central to\ndetermining relative cost-effectiveness.\nThe model was also sensitive to the patient\npathways and their associated probabilities, costs\nand utilities following recurrent disease. In the\ncontext of the available data, which suggested\nsimilar mortality and disease-free survival, this is\nlikely to be unimportant, especially if the patient\npathway following recurrence is not influenced by\nthe initial choice of surgery. Should further data\nbecome available suggesting the contrary, however,\nthen the sensitivity analysis suggests that the\nresults produced by the model would be sensitive\nto the management of recurrent disease and\nfurther work to develop this aspect of the model\nmight be warranted.\nThe analysis was repeated for different stages of\ndisease and results were broadly similar to those of\nthe base-case analysis. Further evidence to allow\ndata synthesis with regard to outcomes by stage is\nrequired.\nEconomic evaluation\n60Quality of life for the family and\ncarers\nThe data reported in Chapter 3 and summarised\nin Table 35 (p. 39) suggest that laparoscopic\nresection is associated with some short-term\nbenefit but takes longer to perform. There is no\nevidence for a difference in long-term outcomes\nmeasured by either surrogate endpoints (e.g.\nlymph node retrieval and resection margins) or\nfinal outcomes up to 3 years postoperation (e.g.\ndeath, disease-free survival and hernia for 3 years\nafter surgery). Laparoscopic surgery is therefore an\napproach that offers patients some short-term\nadvantages without appearing to compromise\nsafety or long-term outcomes (at least up to\n3 years). Furthermore, should the short-term\nbenefits of laparoscopic surgery be realised and\nassociated with a quicker recovery, this may reduce\nthe time and effort that a patient\u2019s family or other\ncarers devote to care following discharge from\nhospital. \nFinancial impact for the patient\nand others\nAlthough the mean age of patients receiving\nsurgery for colorectal cancer is past the age of\nretirement, a significant proportion of patients will\nstill be in employment. Faster recovery following\nsurgery might result in an earlier return to work.\nPeople who would otherwise experience financial\nhardship as a result of being away from work\nwould benefit from the shorter recovery period of\nlaparoscopic surgery. Employers might benefit by\nhaving their employees back to work earlier. \nIt has been argued that an enhanced recovery\nprogramme may offer advantage in terms of\nearlier discharge. If so, such policies may be\nassociated with some transfer of cost from the\nNHS to the families and carers of patients\ncompared with conventional discharge policies.\nWhether such an effect occurs is not clear and a\nrecent Cochrane Review reported that evidence on\ncost shifting was limited.125\nHealth Technology Assessment 2006; Vol. 10: No. 45\n61\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2006. All rights reserved.\nChapter 6\nImplications for other partiesTraining\nCurrently, few surgeons routinely perform\nlaparoscopic surgery within the UK. Training\ncourses and a preceptorship programme have been\norganised by relevant professional groups in\ncollaboration with industry. It has been argued that\nsuch training should reduce operation time and\nconversion rates (Ethicon Endo-Surgery submission\nto NICE, 2005) and possibly improve other\noutcomes. Despite such programmes, it will take\ntime to increase the number of surgeons capable of\nproviding laparoscopic surgery for colorectal\ncancer. The pool of surgeons within the UK with\nthe necessary experience to act as a preceptor\n(experience of at least 100 such resections) is small\n(Ethicon Endo-Surgery submission to NICE, 2005).\nHowever, there are increasing numbers of training\ncourses and schemes available for surgeons wishing\nto develop the necessary skills.\nThe Association of Perioperative Practice has also\nsuggested that in addition to the training of the\nsurgeon, training would also be required for the\nrest of the perioperative team. This would include\nnurses and operating department practitioners\ninvolved with the laparoscopic technology or\nassisting the operating surgeons (Association of\nPerioperative Practice submission to NICE, 2006).\nHALS may be technically easier to perform (and\nhence easier to learn) than laparoscopic surgery.\nHowever, few data are available to assess its role as\na substitute for, or complement to laparoscopic\nsurgery.\nFair access and equity issues\nLaparoscopic equipment does not appear to be a\nrestriction, because it is available in the majority of\nNHS hospitals where colorectal resections take\nplace. An issue will be matching the distribution of\nappropriately skilled surgeons with the distribution\nof colorectal cancer surgery within the UK.\nResource transfers between\nprimary and secondary care\nThe potentially quicker recovery associated with\nlaparoscopic surgery may result in less call on\nprimary care services compared with open surgery,\nalthough earlier discharge from hospital may\nnegate this. The implementation of an enhanced\nrecovery programme, as described by Basse and\ncolleagues,38 for laparoscopic or open surgery may\nresult in a shift in balance of care from secondary\nto primary care irrespective of the type of surgery\nperformed. Given the experience of early\ndischarge schemes for other conditions, the\nmagnitude of such a shift is likely to be modest in\ncost terms, but the shift of work may not be\naccompanied by any additional resource.126\nAvailability of theatre space\nThe evidence available from the systematic review\nof effectiveness reported in Chapter 3 indicates\nthat the duration of operation is greater for\nlaparoscopic resection (by approximately\n40 minutes). Given the limited availability of\ntheatre space, the increased use of laparoscopic\nresection may cause problems for theatre\nmanagers and others involved in managing\ntheatre capacity.\nBudgetary impact on the NHS\nThe budgetary impact of increasing use of\nlaparoscopic surgery from current level of\nprovision of open surgery is estimated in the\nsection \u2018Expected costs\u2019 (p. 7). As outlined in that\nsection, the additional cost of increasing\nlaparoscopic surgery to 25% of all resections may\nrange from less than \u00a3100,000 from the current\nlevel of provision of 0.1% of all resections to an\nadditional cost of \u00a32.1 million.\nSuch estimates are subject to considerable\nuncertainty. Furthermore, they do not include\nlong-term costs (although this review suggests that\nthey will not differ between treatments) or\ndifferences in the cost of presurgery, which may\ndiffer between laparoscopic and open resection.\nOne reason for a difference in presurgery costs\nwould be if laparoscopic surgery were limited to\nless complicated cases. If this occurs, then such\ncases would need to be identified. This may\nrequire routine CT staging of the tumour,\nHealth Technology Assessment 2006; Vol. 10: No. 45\n63\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2006. All rights reserved.\nChapter 7\nImplications for the NHSalthough an increasing number of open\noperations already require such detailed imaging.\nHowever, in some centres, owing to the limited\navailability of CT, an ultrasound is performed\ninstead. Hence any increase in the use of\nlaparoscopic surgery may lead to increased\ndemand for CT imaging. \nAn enhanced recovery programme may result in a\nshorter length of stay; however, cost saving is only\nrealised if beds are closed as a consequence. In\npractice, the freed bed-days may be used to\nprovide other desirable care (providing additional\nbenefit at further cost). This is in addition to the\ncost of establishing the enhanced recovery\nprogramme. Such a programme therefore may not\nresult in reduced overall costs to the NHS.\nImplications for the NHS\n64Main results\nAs stated in Chapter 1, previous guidance from\nNICE on the use of laparoscopic surgery for\ncolorectal cancer was that open rather than\nlaparoscopic surgery was the preferred procedure\nand that laparoscopic surgery should only be\nundertaken as part of an RCT.1 This guidance was\nbased on a technology assessment review\nconducted in 2000.21\nThe 2000 review included data from five RCTs\nand 18 non-randomised comparisons. It found\nsome evidence of short-term benefits for\nlaparoscopic resection. In particular, it found that\nthe use of analgesia and length of stay were less\nfollowing laparoscopic surgery. The additional cost\nof laparoscopic resection was estimated to be\napproximately \u00a3200 per patient. There was\ninsufficient evidence to judge whether the\nprocedures differed in respect of long-term\noutcomes such as survival or disease-free survival. \nLong-term outcome remains the most important\nissue. There were concerns that cure rates may be\nless after laparoscopic surgery, with the possibility\nof port-site metastases. However, early trial results\nsuggested better long-term results after\nlaparoscopic surgery, possibly due to less\ndisruption to the immune system.\nThis updated review identified 19 RCTs and one\nindividual patient data meta-analysis of four of the\nlargest trials comparing laparoscopic with open\nsurgery. Data from the RCTs related to 4568\npatients. The long-term evidence was enhanced by\nthe individual patient data meta-analysis,\nproviding evidence on survival and disease-free\nsurvival up to 3 years after surgery. Furthermore,\nthe data from the individual patient data meta-\nanalysis allowed consideration of the relative time\nto either death or disease recurrence, whereas only\nlimited data on how outcomes changed over the\nduration of follow-up were available from the trial\nreports. \nAlthough the results are associated with some\nuncertainty, laparoscopic surgery is likely to be\nmore costly than open surgery. The magnitude of\nthe extra cost from studies appears to be about\n\u00a3250\u2013300 per patient. Although only limited data\nare available, the costs of laparoscopic surgery\nwere sensitive to the additional costs of the\nequipment required for laparoscopic surgery and\nthe extent of reduction in length of stay compared\nwith open surgery. The other likely cost driver is\nthe extra theatre costs associated with the longer\noperating time. \nThe results of the updated review of data for\nshort-term outcomes have not fundamentally\nchanged the overall picture: convalescence is more\nrapid after laparoscopic surgery and this is\nreflected in less postoperative pain, shorter\nhospital stay and more rapid return to usual\nactivities. Few cases of wound and port-site\nrecurrences were reported. The major change\nsince the 2000 review has been in the evidence on\nrecurrence, disease-free survival and overall\nsurvival. [Academic-in-confidence information\nremoved.] The updated review presented in this\nreport also attempted to assess relative\neffectiveness in terms of differences in wound-\nrelated morbidities such as incisional and port-site\nhernias and persisting pain. Few data were\nidentified for hernia and none on persisting pain.\nWith respect to the risk of hernias, a decision was\ntaken to focus on data from studies comparing\nlaparoscopic and open resection. Alternative data\non incisional hernia and port-site hernias may\nhave been obtained from studies reporting the\noutcomes for open and laparoscopic surgery for\nother conditions. Such data may not, however, be\ngeneralisable to this surgery.\nThe results of the updated review along with\nresults of the individual patient meta-analyses have\nbeen incorporated into the economic evaluation\noutlined in Chapter 5. The balance sheet approach\nillustrates the trade-offs that have to be taken into\naccount when making decisions about which type\nof surgery to use. Assuming that there are no\ndifferences in long-term outcomes, a judgement is\nrequired as to whether the short-term benefits\nfollowing laparoscopic surgery are worth the\nestimated additional \u00a3250\u2013300 per patient.\nThe base-case analysis suggests that laparoscopic\nresection is dominated by open resection in terms\nof incremental cost per life-year and incremental\nHealth Technology Assessment 2006; Vol. 10: No. 45\n65\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2006.

These findings reflect two things:\n(1) the similarity in survival and disease-free\nsurvival between laparoscopic and open surgery\nand (2) the very limited data on utilities which do\nnot capture the short-term benefits associated with\nlaparoscopic surgery. There is a likelihood of\nbetween 40 and 50% that laparoscopic surgery\nwould be considered cost-effective at an\nincremental cost per life-year or QALY that society\nmight be willing to pay. The 50% likelihood of\nbeing cost-effective occurs under the assumption\nof no difference in survival or disease-free survival,\n[Academic-in-confidence information removed].\nThere were no utility data available to model the\ngain in QALYs associated with more rapid\nrecovery. However, it was possible to estimate the\nimplied value for the QALY gain associated with\nan earlier recovery that would be needed for\nlaparoscopic surgery to be considered cost-\neffective. The results of the sensitivity analyses\nsuggest that, should society be willing to pay\n\u00a330,000 per QALY, then earlier recovery following\nlaparoscopic surgery would need to be associated\nwith an increase of QALYs of between 0.009 and\n0.010 QALYs compared with open surgery. To put\nthese figures in context, in the MRC Laparoscopic\nGroin Hernia trial, laparoscopic repair was found\nto be associated with a mean gain in QALYs at a \n3-month follow-up of 0.00583 QALYs (i.e. about\ntwo-thirds of the threshold for laparoscopic\ncolorectal cancer).123 Arguably, it might be\nexpected that the differences in recovery between\nlaparoscopic and open surgery for colorectal\ncancer would be greater than those between\nlaparoscopic and open surgery for inguinal hernia.\nNevertheless, a judgement is required as to\nwhether the magnitude of additional QALYs\nidentified by the implied value calculation can\nplausibly be provided by laparoscopic surgery.\nFurthermore, it should be noted that this implied\nvaluation indicates that their relatively small\ndifferences in QALYs, which cannot be identified\nwith the data available, may be crucial\ndeterminants of conclusions. For example, the\ndifference in QALYs would be equivalent to an\nadditional 3\u20134 days of full health. \nLittle evidence was available on the relative merits\nof HALS or the use of an enhanced recovery\nprogramme for both laparoscopic and open\nsurgery. The limited evidence available suggests\nthat overall HALS might be expected to provide\nsimilar costs and outcomes to laparoscopic surgery.\nIt has been suggested that HALS may be best\nthought of as complementary to laparoscopic\nsurgery, with a role for particular cases rather than\nas a substitute (Ethicon Endo-Surgery submission\nto NICE, 2005).\nWith respect to the role of enhanced recovery, the\none economic evaluation (based on an RCT) that\nformally compared laparoscopic with open surgery\nin the context of such a programme still found\nthat the mean length of stay between the two\nprocedures was less for laparoscopic surgery.\nHowever, such an approach appeared to offer\nadvantages in terms of freeing up bed days for\nother uses following both forms of surgery. The\nprecise magnitude of any difference in length of\nstay between laparoscopic and open surgery is\nimportant as it has a significant impact on both\nthe incremental cost and cost-effectiveness. For\nexample, should there be no difference in length\nof stay, the incremental cost of laparoscopic\nsurgery would be approximately \u00a3700; the cost of\nthe two forms of surgery would be equivalent if the\nlength of stay was approximately 4 days less for\nlaparoscopic surgery (a greater difference than\nsuggested by the results of the systematic review\npresented in Chapter 3).\nThere were relatively few data for any of the\nsubgroups. The data that were available suggest\nthat there may be important differences between\ncolon and rectal cancer. However, this is tentative,\nand it was impossible to judge whether or not\nthere are potentially important differences\nbetween treatments within clinical subgroups of\ncolorectal cancer patients.\nAssumptions, limitations and\nuncertainties\nThe systematic review of effectiveness identified\nconsiderably more RCTs than were available for\nthe review in 2000.21 Unfortunately, for many of\nthe review outcomes the data were sparse. For\nexample, only one RCT (from Hong Kong)\nreported data on return to usual activities.53\nFurthermore, even where data were available, it\nwas not always reported in a format suitable for\ninclusion in the meta-analysis. Nonetheless, the\ndirection and magnitude of effect of these data\nappeared to be consistent and, had it been\npossible to include the data in the meta-analysis,\nthe precision of the estimate available would have\nbeen increased.\nSeveral limitations must be noted when\ninterpreting the results of the review of\neffectiveness (Chapter 3). An extensive literature\nsearch was conducted and both published and\nDiscussion\n66unpublished data were sought. Despite these\nefforts, it is possible that some unpublished studies\nmay have been missed. The impact on direction of\neffect is unknown. The criteria for inclusion and\nexclusion of patients vary considerably between\nthe studies. For example, some trials exclude\npatients with advanced disease whereas other trials\ninclude only patients with colon cancer. This\ntherefore limited our subgroup analysis. Hence the\nresults might not be generalisable to all groups of\npatients who might undergo laparoscopic surgery.\nDifferences in patient group and variation in\noperative technique and treatment protocols\nexisted between studies. However, the review\nattempted to identify and explore sources of\nheterogeneity. In most trials, outcome assessors\nand patients were not blinded, which might have\ninfluenced some of the outcomes. Moreover,\nquality of life and pain scores were reported using\na variety of instruments and therefore\ncomparisons were difficult. Furthermore, in most\ntrials, around 20% of participants randomised to\nlaparoscopic surgery had open surgery, which\ncould have blunted any true differences between\nthe two approaches. Despite these limitations, the\noverall findings obtained from these trials were\nsimilar.\nThe best available evidence on disease-free\nsurvival and overall survival are likely to come\nfrom the individual patient data meta-analyses\nconducted by Bonjer and colleagues (Bonjer J, QE\nII Health Sciences Center, Halifax, NS: personal\ncommunication, 2005). This meta-analysis did not\ninclude all the data from all the available RCTs\nand it had a follow-up of only 3-years. [Academic-\nin-confidence information removed.]\nNonetheless, had the data from the other trials\nbeen incorporated, it is likely that the precision of\nthe estimates would have been improved. The\ngreatest limitation of this review is that the data\navailable relate to at most a 3-year time horizon.\nMore long-term follow-up data are therefore\nrequired before it could be certain that there is no\ndifference in longer term recurrence and survival.\nThe data available were very limited for some of\nthe outcomes and also for the subgroups and\ninsufficient to draw firm conclusions about the\nrelative effectiveness of the techniques being\ncompared. Further studies would be useful to\naddress these deficiencies in the evidence base. \nThere was little information on the longer term\nrisks of wound-related morbidity. Insufficient data\nwere available to incorporate the risk of and the\ndifferent types of hernia (port-site and incisional\nhernias) into the economic model. In studies\ncomparing laparoscopic with open surgery for\nother conditions, the risks (and associated costs\nand utilities) of these wound-related morbidities\nhave been central determinants of cost-\neffectiveness. Further data are needed on the risks\nof outcomes, such as hernias and persisting pain\n(along with their costs of management and\nassociated effects on utility).\nVery meagre data were available for the\ncomparison of HALS and open surgery. This\npaucity of data highlights the need for more\nstudies for this comparison. \nIn common with other laparoscopic procedures,\nlaparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer is\ntechnically more difficult than open surgery. The\ncost-effectiveness (and also almost certainly the\nsafety) of laparoscopic surgery will be influenced\nby where operators are on their learning curves.\nThe effect of learning may explain why some trial\npatients randomised to laparoscopic surgery\nactually received open surgery (\u2018opposite method\ninitiated\u2019) and why so many trial patients allocated\nto laparoscopic surgery were converted during the\nprocedure from laparoscopic to open surgery.\nIncreased experience in selecting which patients\nare suitable for laparoscopic surgery and in\nimproving operator expertise might be expected\nto reduce both of these rates.\nIn addition, the systematic review was conducted\non an intention-to-treat basis. Therefore, any\nreduction in the rate at which patients undergoing\nlaparoscopic surgery are converted to open\nsurgery might be expected to increase the\ndifference observed between laparoscopic and\nopen surgery.\nAs with any economic evaluation, a number of\nassumptions have been made. These assumptions\nhave mostly been made in response to the very\nlimited data available. For example, as mentioned\nabove, the economic evaluation did not\ndifferentiate between port-site and incisional\nhernia, which may in fact differ in terms of cost of\ntreatment and effect on patients\u2019 well-being.\nSimilarly, no usable data with which to\ndifferentiate the two interventions were available\nfor such aspects as rates for reoperations,\nfollowing a recurrence. As a result, these rates\nwere assumed to be the same, which may not be\njustified given the lack of data to support this. A\nfurther simplifying assumption was the constant\nrate of all-cause mortality. Although this\nassumption is unrealistic, it will have little effect\nHealth Technology Assessment 2006; Vol. 10: No. 45\n67\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2006. All rights reserved.on the results given the very much higher\nmortality, but similar mortality for each type of\nsurgery, for colorectal cancer.\nOne concern about the economic model is the\nquantity and quality of data available. In\nparticular, data on two key components, cost and\nutilities, were very limited. In the case of costs, the\ndata available were subject to considerable\nimprecision, as they had been derived from a\nsmall RCT.40 Alternative cost data from the\nCLASICC trial were also explored within the\neconomic model, in sensitivity analysis, and\nproduced similar results to the base-case analysis\n(Franks PJ, Thames Valley University: personal\ncommunication, 2005). It should be noted that the\ndata from CLASICC are preliminary and may be\nsubject to change, hence they should be treated\nwith caution. With respect to utilities, data were\nalmost entirely absent and the results presented in\nterms of incremental cost per QALY in Chapter 5\nshould be treated with extreme caution. This is\nbecause data on the potential QALY gain that\nmight be apparent after laparoscopic resection,\nsuch as shorter hospitalisation, earlier return to\nusual activities and less postoperative pain, are\nnon-existent, making the results with regard to\nquality of life extremely tenuous. Additional\nrelevant data may soon be available from the UK-\nbased CLASICC trial in which data are being\ncollected on costs and QALYs (based on responses\nto the EQ-5D). A revised economic analysis based\non the best available data on effectiveness from\nthe systematic review should be conducted once\ndata on costs and utilities from CLASICC are\navailable.\nThe nature of the data available also had an\nimpact on the economic evaluation. Data on\nsurvival and disease-free survival were only\navailable for a 3-year time horizon. In the\neconomic model, it was assumed that such data\ncould be extrapolated up to a 25-year time\nhorizon. Having data available for a longer time\nhorizon would greatly strengthen the results of the\neconomic model. An important clinical outcome,\nnot explicitly incorporated into the economic\nmodel, is conversion due to lack of useable data.\nThere are very few data on the impact that\nconversion might have on cost and both short-\nand long-term effects. Another area where the\npaucity of data might have impacted on results is\nrecurrence of disease. The model has not allowed\nrecurrence of disease to be split by type, that is,\nresidual disease, local recurrence, wound and port-\nsite recurrence. As a result, important differences\nby type of recurrence, and therefore method of\nsurgical resection, could not be observed. It should\nbe noted, however, that the 3-year disease-free\nsurvival data used within the analysis suggest no\ndifference in rates, although longer term data are\nneeded to substantiate this. A further area in\nwhich the data available are limited is the\nmanagement of patients following a recurrence.\nThe likelihood that a recurrence would occur and\nthe likelihood that a reoperation would be\nperformed could not be differentiated between the\ntwo forms of resection. Similarly, the likelihood of\nnon-operative management for patients with\nrecurrent disease also could not be differentiated\nbetween the two forms of resection. If differences\nare found to lie in these areas in the future, then\nthese costs and consequences will have to be\naddressed. Finally, the rates of mortality in the\neconomic model were assumed to be constant over\ntime, which is unrealistic given the time horizon of\nthe model (25 years). Nonetheless, as the available\ndata suggested no difference in survival at 3 years,\nthe effect of changing mortality rates over time\nwould not be expected to have much effect on\nrelative efficiency. Should longer term data\nbecome available that suggest a difference in\nsurvival, further work to develop this aspect of the\nmodel estimates would be warranted.\nDiscussion\n68Implications for the NHS\n\u25cf The use of laparoscopic surgery within the NHS\nwill depend on judgements about the balance\nbetween additional cost, shorter recovery and\napparently similar long-term effectiveness at\n3 years.\n\u25cf Laparoscopic surgery costs (approximately\n\u00a3250\u2013300 per patient) more than open surgery\n(the current standard). This higher cost is\nassociated with longer operation times.\nFurthermore, the additional equipment cost is\nnot fully compensated by the reductions in\nlength of stay.\n\u25cf Laparoscopic surgery is associated with short-\nterm benefits in terms of less postoperative pain\nand more rapid recovery.\n\u25cf Overall and disease-free survival appear to be\nsimilar after each type of procedure at 3 years.\n\u25cf There is a scarcity of data relating to HALS.\nThe one small RCT identified reports similar\noutcomes to laparoscopic surgery. \n\u25cf An enhanced recovery programme offers the\npossibility of freeing bed-days. It also reduces the\ndifference in length of stay between laparoscopic\nand open surgery and therefore reduces one of\nthe advantages of laparoscopic surgery. \n\u25cf Should the use of laparoscopic surgery increase,\nthis would require surgeons to become\nproficient in the technique. Rates of conversion\nbetween laparoscopic and open surgery are\nassociated with a \u2018learning curve\u2019. Appropriate\ntraining, such as the preceptorship programme\ndeveloped by professional organisations, is\nneeded for both patient selection and the\ntechnical aspects of the procedure.\n\u25cf If laparoscopic surgery is to be increased, long-\nterm audit is required for quality assurance\npurposes.\nImplications for patients and carers\n\u25cf Laparoscopic surgery is less invasive than open\nsurgery and likely to reduce the recovery\nperiod, while providing similar long-term\noutcomes compared with open surgery. \n\u25cf Laparoscopic (or open surgery) may be\nprovided in the context of an enhanced\nrecovery programme, which leads to a shorter\nhospital stay. This is a benefit only if there is no\nincreased burden of care after discharge. There\nis no evidence to clarify this.\nImplications for research\n\u25cf Direct measurements of utilities from recovery\nthrough to the long term are required to\nconfirm the study findings. These data should\nbecome available from the CLASICC trial.\n\u25cf Better data on the resources and costs of both\nlaparoscopic and open surgery are required.\nAgain, although data from a preliminary\nanalysis conducted as part of the CLASICC trial\nhave been used to inform sensitivity analysis,\nmore detailed data should become available\nwhen this trial is completed.\n\u25cf Further long-term follow-up of all RCT cohorts\nis required. \n\u25cf Bonjer and colleagues should be encouraged to\nextend their individual patient data meta-\nanalysis in terms of both follow-up and\ninclusion of other relevant studies by involving\nother relevant groups, as has been done for\nother laparoscopic procedures. \n\u25cf In other evaluations of laparoscopic surgery, the\nRR of wound-related morbidity has played an\nimportant part in assessing relative effectiveness\nand cost-effectiveness. Further data are needed\non the risks of outcomes, such as hernias and\npersisting pain (along with their costs of\nmanagement and associated effects on utility). \n\u25cf If HALS is to be adopted widely,\nmethodologically sound RCTs comparing HALS\nwith both laparoscopic and open surgery are\nnecessary.\n\u25cf Further research is required relating to the\nalternative surgical approaches for the different\nlocations and stages of colon and rectal cancer,\ntaking account of surgical competence. \n\u25cf Further research is required on the effectiveness\nand cost-effectiveness of an enhanced recovery\nprogramme for both open and laparoscopic\nsurgery compared with conventional open\nsurgery.\n\u25cf Laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer is\ntechnically challenging and performance is\nlikely to improve with experience. This issue is\nimportant, and further methodologically robust\nresearch is warranted.\nHealth Technology Assessment 2006; Vol. 10: No. 45\n69\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2006.

The costing was undertaken prospectively\non a subset of the whole trial population. Detailed theatre\nresource use was based on a subgroup of patients (10\nlaparoscopic and 10 open patients for each recruiting\nsurgeon). These data were used to impute values for the\nrest of the sample. Hospital stay was from date of operation\nto discharge (or death) plus one day for a preoperative\nadmission. Stay was divided into intensive, high-dependency\nand surgical ward care. Postoperative complications were\nobtained for each patient. For complications resulting in\nsurgery, costs were based on detailed descriptions of the\noperation, which included anaesthetic time, length of\nhospitalisation (including stay in ICU and HDU). Other\ncomplications were costed according to national figures.\nPost-discharge resource use was based on patient-\ncompleted questionnaires. Unit costs were based on\nnational figures or study specific estimates based on data\nfrom manufacturers.
