Memory has also \nbeen significant in research on people who not part of a formal record of \nhistory. This memory-work includes a focus on Black identity, especially in \nthe work of Toni Morrison and Paul Gilroy.  This paper seeks to examine the \nrelevance of memory and re-memory for the social geographies of the South \nAsian population in Britain. In the first section I examine visual and material \ncultures as mechanisms for memory, especially their role in figuring \ndiasporic positioning, and identity politics. These are form of memory as \ntestimonies and biographical narratives. In the paper I have argued for the \nrelevance and value of re-memory in understanding the narratives of British \nAsian heritage in the everyday domestic environment. Re-memory is an \nalternative social narrative to memory as it is a form of memory that is not an \nindividual linear, biographical narrative. Re-memory is a conceptualisation of \nencounters with memories, stimulated through scents sounds and textures in \nthe everyday. \u201eHome possessions\u201f constitute precipitates of re-memories and \nnarrated histories. These are souvenirs from the traversed landscapes of the \njourney, signifiers of \u201eother\u201f narrations of the past not directly experienced \nbut which incorporate narrations of other\u201fs oral histories or social histories \n 2 \nthat are part of the diasporic community\u201fs re-memories. Collectively, visual \nand material cultures are identified as precipitates of these re-memories in \nthe form of historical artefacts of heritage and tradition. \n \nKeywords   Memory   re-memory   identity   domestic cultures   material \ncultures. \n \n \nDepartment of Geography, Lancaster University, Lancashire, LA1 4YL, UK. \n \nVisual and Material Cultures as artefacts \n \nThe role, value and nature of memory is a major theme in many social    \nscience disciplines. So it is somewhat surprising, given memory\u201fs critical      \nimportance in defining a sense of self in a spatial and temporal frame, that it \nhas been neglected in contemporary geographical writing. In this paper I \nexamine the importance of researching visual and material cultures in the \nhome, as mechanisms for remembering geographies of lived environments \nthat contribute to British Asian social history. These active connections with \nmemories through visual and material cultures constitute processes of \nidentification for this group. Memories activated through these cultures in the \nhome are considered as essential in discourses of heritage, which are \nsignificant for the South Asian diaspora. The prismatic qualities of material \ncultures ensure that these cultures become nodes of connection in a network \nof people, places, and narration of past stories, history and traditions. Solid \n 3 \nmaterials are charged with memories that activate common connections to \npre-migratory landscapes and environments. These memories signify \ngeographical nodes of connection which shape and shift contemporary social \ngeographies in Britain, post-migration. This form of memory-history \ngeographically locates the post-colonial within landscapes, mobilised in the \nprocess of migration. These landscapes are neither bounded nationalistic \nlandscapes or, lived tangible everyday spaces; instead, these remembered \nlocations situate the post-colonial migrant. This situation is a post-colonial \nspace-time, unbounded by formal nation or national history, not usually \nmapped or recorded by the academy. \n \nIn this research I have mapped the postcolonial situation through the use of \ndomestic cultures as artefactual records of connections to other remembered \nlandscapes, natures and lived environments. This paper is a move away from \nconsidering memory-history (as has been previously done), within structures \nof elite and vernacular past landscapes (Wright 1985; Wright 1991). Here, I \nposition the home as a site where an history linked with past landscapes is \nrefracted through the material artefacts in the domestic sphere (Samuel \n1994). This reflects a shift in the focus of British heritage work that disturbs \npartial and thin accounts of a national past, which have emerged more \nrecently. However, questions of \u201ewhose heritage?\u201f and \u201ewhose histories?\u201f are \ncontinually significant in examining the relationship between memory and \nthe materials of historical narration (Hall 2000). It is clear therefore that any \nBritish historical geography or British heritage programme of presenting a \nrelevant inclusive heritage record should include an understanding of \n 4 \nmemory-work that occurs in the vernacular landscapes of the British Asian \nhome.  \n \nHome is the site of critical artefacts that impact on the ways that South \nAsians remember collectively, representing a body of artefacts relevant to \nBritish heritage. By linking the refraction of local, national and migrational \nmemory-histories, embedded in the fabric of everyday life, it is possible to \nrefocus on the significance of \u201ehome\u201f in the making of broader national \ndiscourses. The \u201ehome\u201f is the stage for emitting history (Samuel 1994). \nMaterial cultures are not simply situated as mementoes of a bounded past but \nare precipitates of syncretised textures of remembered ecologies and \nlandscapes. These solid precipitates are where memories of past accounts \naccrue. Signification of identity, history and heritage, through these material \ncultures, depends upon the continuing dependence on the past for sustenance \nin the present. These material cultures secrete an essence of security and \nstability. Ironically these material foundations are sometimes transient, \nephemeral things, which in turn fade, tear, fragment, dissolve and break. \nIndividual objects relate to individual biographies, but are simultaneously \nsignificant in stories of identity on national scales of citizenship, and the \nintimate domestic scene left behind. The new site of home becomes the site \nof historical identification, and the materials of the domestic sphere are the \npoints of signification of enfranchisement with landscapes of belonging, \ntradition, and self-identity.  \n \n 5 \nMaterial cultures, through their installation are critical, in the formation of \nnew political identities, carving out new landscapes of belonging. These new \ncontexts for material artefacts refigure the narration of the past imbued \nwithin them. Memory is an important political tool, grounding both \nindividual memory and collective cultural heritage stories. These processes \nare not exclusive to the South Asian population, in fact other writers have \nlooked at different migrant communities and their valuing of domestic \nartefacts as stores of cultural narratives and memorialised biographical \nnarratives (for example see Boym 1998 and Lambert 2001). The presence of \nthese materials of heritage disturbs and shift notions of British-ness. By \nlooking at the collage of material cultures in the British Asian home as \nlayered with aspects of memory, I have examined them as historical \ninscriptions within the domestic landscape. Material cultures are critical in \nrelation to the new sites of identity-territory relations; memory-history as I \nhave posited it, is activated in relation to the new context of living. These \ndomestic inscriptions record the post-colonial positioning that informs a \npolitics of South Asianess within a multicultural landscape. Imbued within \nthis political orientation is a geography of being, belonging and making \nhome, linked directly with a post-colonial history. Within this analysis \n\u201emultiple provenances\u201f emerge (Parkin 1999, 309), where the notion of \n\u201ehome\u201f and \u201eorigin\u201f are not fixed in one locus. Memory-history counters the \nunbounded notions of  \u201eAsian\u201f ethnicity (biological) and nationality \n(cultural) through a system of collective logic that is a collectively \nremembered and valued memory-history (Tolia-Kelly 2002). The specific \ncontexts of \u201ehome\u201f and origin are set out in the next section, along with some \n 6 \nmethodological contexts. This section introduces the substantive argument \npromoting the value of re-memory in the social geographies of British \nAsians. \n \nThe \u2018diaspora\u2019 makes \u2018home\u2019 \nMy research has been with South Asian women in North-London. My \nargument demonstrates the valency of social memory as inscribed within the \nmaterials of culture as signifiers of \u201ehome\u201f, \u201etradition\u201f and \u201ehistory\u201f; together \nforming a collage of \u201etextures of identification\u201f. In previous writing (Tolia-\nKelly 2001; 2002) I have demonstrated the value of memory-work in \nsituating their identities within geographies that are mobile; the experience of \na past home resides with you as you traverse toward your next. Along this \nroute other cultures are engaged with. For example, British Asians when \nengaged with visual cultures such as film, reconnect with social testimony \nand multisensory body-memories as part of the process of engaging with the \ntext (Tolia-Kelly 2001). In this paper I will illustrate the process of re-\nmemory as it contributes to post-colonial South Asian discourses of heritage, \nrace and cultural identity. This is memory that is inscribed with a race-\npolitics that is part of everyday social discourse (Brah 1999).  As Leela \nGandhi (1998) has notably expressed, there is difficulty in considering the \npost-colonial position as being truly post, as the struggles that these societies \nface are intrinsically linked to social, cultural, economic and political \nstructures which are controlled and shaped by those ex-colonial powers. \n \n 7 \nRe- memory is memory that is encountered in the everyday, but is not always \na recall or reflection of actual experience. It is separate to memories that are \nstored as site-specific signs linked to experienced events. Re-memory can be \nthe memories of others as told to you by parents, friends, and absorbed \nthrough day-to-day living, that are about a sense of self beyond a linear \nnarrative of events, encounters and biographical experiences. It is an \ninscription of time in place, which is touched, accessed, or mediated through \nsensory stimuli. A scent, sound or sight can metonymically transport you to a \nplace where you have never been, but which is recalled through the \ninscription left in the imagination, lodged there by others\u201f narratives. This \nform of social geographical co-ordinate is not always directly experienced \nbut operates as a significant connective force. Re-memory is a resource for \nthe sustenance of a sense of self that temporally connects to social heritage, \ngenealogy, and acts as a resource for identification with place. The origin of \nthe concept of re-memory is Toni Morrison\u201fs Beloved (1987).  \n \n\u201cI was talking about time. It\u2019s so hard for me to believe in it. Some things go. \nPass on. Some things just stay. I used to think it was my rememory. You \nknow. Some things you forget. Other things you never do. But it\u2019s not. \nPlaces, places are still there. If a house burns down, it\u2019s gone. But the place \n\u2013 the picture of it \u2013 stays, and not in just my rememory, but out there in the \nworld. . Someday you be walking down the road and you hear something or \nsee something going on. So clear. And you think it\u2019s you thinking it up. A \nthought picture. But no. It\u2019s when you bump into a rememory that belongs to \nsomeone else. . The picture is still there and what\u2019s more, if you go there \u2013 \n 8 \nyou never was there \u2013 if you go there and stand in the place where it was, it \nwill happen again; it will be there for you, waiting for you\u201d (Morrison 1987, \n35-36) \n \nMorrison proposes re-memory as a form of race-memory. Through bodily \nencounters in space, Morrison promotes the idea that you can bump into the \noppressive experience of slavery and lost narratives. For Morrison her \nwriting through of re-memory narratives makes the black experience and the \ncollectively held record of slavery into text. The text makes material this \nintangible slave history. Re-memory inscribes the history of Black oppression \nwithin the public domain, as a resource for the centring of self through the \npast, for the black community. Re-memory mediates between now and the \nseparation of slaves from their families, homes, and lives. Because re-\nmemories are socially experienced they become material, and are shared \namongst the African-American community. These are narratives beyond the \ntraditional form of oral testimony, these operate in public space, and have for \nthe individual encountering it, an intimate resonance with past narratives of \nothers\u201f not known. Their effect is constitutive; the memories form the social \nmemory of the community, effectively linking the group through a sense of \ncollective history. Re-memory\u201fs re-inscription in the environment is a \npolitical force, countering exclusionary heritage discourses, providing a form \nof synthesised embodied heritage. For those other diaspora\u201fs who have \nexperienced post-colonial labour migration there is also a sense of rupture \nwith a heritage story of a community, not recorded formally. My aim is to \ntrace the social memories which are critical to British Asians and their sense \n 9 \nof geographical identity and heritage. To do this I have chosen the site of \nhome as the place where memories traverse, are stored, exchanged, \nencountered and materialised. \n  \n\u201eHome\u201f has many incarnations within social memory of the diaspora. \nIntertwined in the social memory of the group are imagined and lived \nlandscapes of home, utopian senses of \u201ehome\u201f and where \u201ehome\u201f continues \nto be a source of identification. Home as feminists have argued, is not always \na site of refuge; it continues to be a site of gendered oppression and violence. \nFor black women, home is the landscape used strategically as a site for \nrefuge from the alienating experience of racism and marginality. Within my \nresearch however, home is a conceptual tool to discover different means of \nengagement with lived landscapes; home harbour cultures of \u201emaking home\u201f \nand enfranchisement to new places and citizenships. Possessions operate as \nmaterial nodes that symbolise, refract and resonate with the diasporic \njourney; they are connective markers to geographical nodes of identification. \nThrough their prismatic nature \u201eother\u201f lives, lands and homes are made part \nof this one. Material possessions operate as a buffer against exclusive \nnational cultures by encompassing a collage of familiar textures. These \n\u201ehome possessions\u201f (Miller 2001) presence the social memories, they \nconstitute precipitates of narrated histories, and artefacts of heritage and \ntradition. These are souvenirs from the traversed landscapes of the journey, \nas well as signifiers of \u201eother\u201f narrations of the past not directly experienced; \nthese narrations are termed re-memories (Morrison 1987; 1990). These are \nidentified as precipitates of lived racial politics in the form of material \n 10 \nartefacts (Csikszentmihalyi and Rochberg-Halton 1981; Mehta and Belk \n1991).  \n \nMethodology \nThe research material derives from a three-stage research method where I \ninterviewed two groups of Asian women from North West London over a \nperiod of ten weeks and met them for three group sessions, plus an individual \ntour of their homes. The two groups comprised of a working class group \nliving in Harlesden in the London Borough of Brent, an a wealthier middle \nclass group living in Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire and Middlesex. Many \nwomen in this second group had migrated here from East Africa in the \n1970s. I conducted group interviews (Burgess et al 1996) to gain insight into \nthe social context to their values of living, and their senses of belonging and \ncitizenship. In the first session I asked the women to map out their routes to \nBritain, essentially their biographies. In the second session I asked the group \nto bring in visual or material objects that were important in \u201emaking home\u201f. I \nalso was invited to visit their homes to see these artefacts in situ; the women \n\u201etoured\u201f the home and showed me the valued objects that made their sense of \n\u201ehome\u201f complete. In the third session we asked the group about their ideal \nlandscapes of home, which contributed to a series of paintings by Melanie \nCarvalho (see Tolia-Kelly, 2002).  \n \nThe research method involved a complex triangulation of group-interviews, \nhome tour, and biographical mapping. The method was designed to reflect \nthe complexity of the processes of identification that are in operation for this \n 11 \npost-colonial group. The methods employed establish the historical and \ngeographical contexts to the women\u201fs lives in Britain, as well as establishing \nthe role of memory in day-to day living (Tolia-Kelly 2001; 2002). By \nconsidering these cultures as situated within the construction of a settled \nBritish home, I sought to undermine monolithic notions of \u201eAsianess\u201f, and \nposit cultural practices as relational, dynamic and dialectically linked to a \nshifting international geography of migration and race-politics.  \n \n \nEnshrining heritage - Mandirs, Medinas and religious iconography \n \nFirstly I focus on the sacred artefacts, in the form of shrines and religious \niconology within the homes of the women interviewed. In all the women\u201fs \nhomes, there was a significant religious space in the home. The mandir is the \nsacred home temple that each of the Hindu women has.  The meanings of \nthese shrines\/artefacts operate as reminders of moral values, symbolise \nstories in the Bhagavad-Gita\n1\nand Ramayana\n2\n, and a collection of religious \nicons which reflect different life values \u2013 wealth, prosperity, health, and \nrighteousness. My interest was in the materiality of these objects in relation \nto the women\u201fs feelings of home, belonging and identity. It is quite clear \nfrom the tone and feeling with which the women describe the religious icons \nand objects, how much their lives are intertwined with the existence of the \nshrine itself and the variety of icons and other materials held within. \n \n                                                 \n1\n This is the sacred Hindu text which is part of the Mahabharata. \n2\n The Ramayana is the Sanskrit epic of Rama, an incarnation of Vishnu. \n 12 \nHansa -\u201cPreviously in my old house I just had a cabinet which I made, I \ndidn\u2019t have a mandir or anything. Recently in the last 3-4 years, in Bombay I \nmanaged to get a little mandir, 4\u2019 by 4\u2019. It\u2019s just a wooden mandir, really \ntiny. That\u2019s because there problems of bringing it down here. I had made my \nmandir out of a small cabinet, furniture, not exactly a mandir shape or \nanything. We had this before. Murti\u2019s are in there too. Slowly, slowly I\u2019ve \ncollected them. . .\u201d \n \nThese Hindu mandirs individually, are dynamic sites whose content, size \nand aesthetics shift over time. They usually start as a small place in the \nhouse, a corner that will not be defiled during menstruation, and so they are \noften in cabinets, cupboards or whole rooms that can be locked away. The \nshrines hold religious relics such as gangajaal \u2013 water from the Ganges, \nvibhuti \u2013 the sacred dust from incense burning from pilgrim sites in India or \nfrom other temples, chunis \u2013 small pieces of embroidered cloth used on \nstatues murtis from temples. These are blessed during aartis \u2013 special daily \nprayer. Murtis themselves have been purchased sometimes at sites of \npilgrimage, the Asian cloth shops, grocers, or even sweet shops. Alongside \nthese are chromolithographs (Pinney 1995)  \u2013 vividly coloured, paper images \nof icons, gurus and saints; and other images which are made by combining \nthe processes of photography and lithographics with layers of colour printed \nonto a photograph.  \n \nThe presence of these shrines, significantly contribute to heritage-practices \nand a sense of cultural nationalism. The images in the shrines are \n 13 \niconographic. These significations are locked into a connection with place, \ntherefore they are iconographic both as a religious sign and a sign for a \nparticular landscape. They represent an inter-ocular field (Appadurai and \nBeckenridge1992). Essentially this means that the texts can be read \nsimultaneously as singular texts, or as icons with multiple significations. The \nmeaning of an individual religious image can operate as a sign for that \nreligion, a sign for the story of an individual icon, a signification of India \n(through its visual grammar), or as a personalised metonymical symbol of \nthe moment that it was received (from a parent, given by a priest), or a \nparticular space that it is connected with (site of pilgrimage). Through having \nthese characteristics, any individual image oscillates between encompassing \nreligious, spatial, and historical iconography (Pinney 1997, p111). These \nsigns are part of a collective, visual vocabulary for the South Asian \ncommunity; social connections with a sense of communal identity are made \nthrough visual registers of colour, texture, sound and scent. The gangajaal is \na container (usually copper) holding water from the Ganges. On sight, in the \nshrine, it operates as a symbol of the sacred site of the Ganges and of its \nregenerative powers. It is also a symbol of nation, of India. The Ganges is the \nsite of pilgrimage and therefore the gangajaal acts as a souvenir of that \nplace, and the moments of visiting, it may also be a metonym for others\u201f \nnarratives about the Ganges, for Hinduism and the regenerative power of \nGanges water. The gangajaal makes tangible these various narratives and \ntales, and consolidates various senses of place linked to the object; \nbiographical and memorialised connections which are used to figure a life in \nthe U.K., post-migration. \n 14 \n \nThese artefacts are possessions and their presence echoes their power to \nsituate and enfranchise through being present. Here, I privilege the value of \npossessions as linked to the diasporic sense of disconnection and loss, but \nrecognise them as being critical in configuring and celebrating a new British \nidentity by forming a body of cultural heritage. These cultures in the home \nare the remnants, the physical debris of the social imagination that is re-\nmemory. The artefacts are considered precipitates of re-memory; they are the \nsolidified tangible points of connection to the past narratives of migration, \nlandscapes, and environments of belonging. They are inclusive of both \nhistorical and geographical memories of lived environments and their \ncultures of living previously considered as history-memory (Tolia-Kelly \n2002). The shrines are significant in their value as points of engagement with \nbeing, living and developing a history in England. \n \nThe shrine is a valuable site, whose form fits the experience of migration. \nShrines are dynamic; they allow growth of a collection of pieces that are \nsacred and blessed. These are not limited to religious sacred objects and \nicons. They are considered to be at the heart of family relations. Sometimes \nthey are literally sites where the family genealogy can be traced. The shrines \nbecome places where, due to their sacredness, important family objects are \nplaced. The shrines incorporate family photos of those who have passed \naway \u2013 grandfathers, great aunts, grandmothers, and great uncles. The shrine \nbecomes collaged, continually superimposed with objects reflecting intimate \nmoments and sacred life moments which are preserved and treasured; a \n 15 \nrosary given by a father, a piece of gold received on a wedding day, to sea-\nshells, or shiv-ling that were in the family home prior to marriage are all \ncomposed and united in the laying out of the shrine. This process of collage \nis an accrual of the sacred, emotionally valued by the family. Adding objects \nto the shrine is inscription. Sometimes families place letters at the shrine \u2013 \njob applications, offers, letters of achievement and even travel tickets, so that \nall these possible journeys can be blessed. Symbolic representations of the \nfirst breath of a baby, the first job, the wedding, and all the rites of passage \nand major life stages can sometimes be traced. By the murtis presence, the \nwomen believe preventative measures have been taken \u2013 preventing \nobstacles, mishaps and general misfortune. Intensely personal prayers are \nrecited here- celebrating, requesting and proffering. These are a set of intense \nmoments, and small things; miniature icons representing larger things, \nmoments, and connections. Embroidered onto these textures of the object is a \nset of relationships between biographical and national and\/or cultural \nidentifications. The shrines accrue and secrete meanings connected to \nremembering experiences and narratives of others. Over time the shrine \naccumulates layers of meaning, it is believed to emanate protective \nvibrations; it is a spiritual place first before it is a purely religious site. Its \nsignificance grows with time along with its representativeness of family \nbiography; the objects form a significant collage of embedded events, \nmoments, and aesthetic imprints. These private, personal moments are \ninscribed physically. Their meanings shift in context, as the shrine is moved \nwhen the family move and thus traces migration at every scale.  The mandir \nis the responsibility of the matriarch. Below Hansa describes her memory of \n 16 \nher mother and her mother-in-law, who have different religious beliefs and \ncommitment and their lived landscapes. \n \nHansa -\u201cIn India it (public temple) was opposite our home, always wherever \nyou go, it was so much on your way that you could quickly pray and leave. \nFor my mum it was very important despite being partially sighted. She never \nused to go out too much. But she used to make her way up to the Derasa \n(Jain temple). . .Its not in an open area, but residential area. It\u2019s nice, \nDerasa is always nice, cool places. . India is very hot but these places are \nvery cool. They hold and bring a sense of inner peace . .   It (the mandir at \nhome) brings me peace. It\u2019s basically important for what I do and say  . . I \napologise for what I\u2019ve done. . .Without it, I would still be able to focus, but \nmy boys would not have seen it, and they would not be used to us seeing it. I \ncan still close my eyes even if I don\u2019t have a mandir, I can visualise. Because \nI have see day in and day out that Derasa there. But J and the boys they have \nnot seen it.\u201d \n \nThe mandirs refract collages of social and spiritual life. Their presence is \nalso signification of cultural, social and moral discourses and practices. \nTherefore the shrines reflect back into the home many moments and spaces. \nThey both absorb daily activity and secrete a historical context to these. As \nthey trigger memories they operate on many scales of time, their reflectivity \nenhances the meaning of these shrines personally, culturally and they in turn \nproduce new meanings and memories for the women, and their families. For \nHansa\u201fs family the shrine becomes a source of re-memory of Hansa\u201fs \n 17 \nexperiences of these religious landscapes of the past (in various life stages). \nThe shrine makes tangible her stories and others\u201f stories told through her \nnarratives. Various places and moments are brought into the home through \nthese material links. Her memories are made present through the matter of \nthe shrine. \n \nFigure 1 Lalita\u2019s mandir. \nFigure 2 Hansa\u2019s mandir. \nFigure 3 Shazia\u2019s mandir. \n \nThe relationship that Lalita describes below illustrates the interpolation of \npublic and private religious practices into a critical cultural expression. These \nartefacts embedded within the social and cultural life of being in India, and \nform her sense of self through their presence. \n \nLalita \u2013\u201c I think religion is part of my culture. Especially being brought up \nin Delhi, for me it was not two different things. I just couldn\u2019t say this is my \nculture. O.K. it\u2019s Kathak, and classical music, and touching elders feet, \nrespecting them as my culture. And this is my religion. No, it was a fusion of \nboth, it was blended together. So it was like . . .all festivals were not only \nreligion, not only culture but fun also. So it was like a blend of everything. \nAnd we enjoy it. Like sometimes we were 40 of us going together. My father \nhad eight brothers, and sisters, their spouses, their children, and cousins. \nEverybody going, booked like four coupes of the train, and rent a bus at \nJamnu.\u201d  \n 18 \n \nLalita describes the difficulty of defining her culture without religion. But \nthe religious excursions she describes are social events. They have codes, \nrites and rituals of their own. Religion is not bounded within strict definitions \nof personal relationship with God, or limited to certain religious rituals. The \nreligious learning is part of socialisation in the home. Each daily task has a \nreligious moral code inscribed. For example \u201eeating\u201f has rules and codes.  \nDefining the moral order of family hierarchy were part of the function of \nreligious excursions. However the religious text was not privileged over the \nsocial function of the trip. Religious texts and iconographies are woven \nthrough daily practices and rites. To some degree the shrines operate in the \nsame sphere; their presence socialises family members into religious \nteachings and their influence on daily life. The shrine itself, or objects and \nicons within, are incorporated into the events of different life stages. The \nshrine activates a connection biographically and spiritually. The intensely \npersonal spheres are shot through with religious moral codes and practices, \nwhich are also inscribed onto the shrine. This is done through adding objects, \nas well as inscribing contemporary meanings onto the materials within the \nshrine.  \n \nShazia -\u201cThis is my mandir, it\u2019s the first room in the house. It\u2019s got our \npapers, the piano. . . .  This room has always been a mixture, everything has \ngot some meaning. You know like any important letters we have . .Everything \nhas over the years been picked up. Like this is from my mums place. This one \n 19 \nI got from her mandir. . . the mandir has photos of Lalit's parents, and my \nparents.\u201d  \n \nThe shrine\u201fs aesthetics and icons invite spiritual focus, they instil a sense of \ncultural education and integrity. Shazia believes that her family are lost \nwithout this reference point. Through gazing at the icons, they are required to \nsituate themselves in relation to the heritage practices of grandparents, \nparents and her sense of kinship networks. For the diaspora a positioning \n(Hall 1990) is attainable through its presence. This is a complex positioning \nfor the South Asian diaspora which can at different moments define itself in \nrelation to both religious identity (Hinduism, Islam, Jain, Sikh or Christain) \nand as post-colonial Indian nationals. My focus here is on the shrines \nconnective power to other landscapes rather than religious ideology. The \nshrine is symbolic of a cultural identity linked to a space pre-migration and \nits textures are central to this recalling process. The process of recall does not \nconnect necessarily to lived and experienced memories or events, these \ncollage with narratives of \u201eothers\u201f. The scent, touch, sight and sound of \nprayer, prayer bell, scent of camphor, incense, sandalwood, the feel of \nvibhuti, cloth, ghee and cotton wool, or the sight of icons, of vermilion are \nreal textures, referencing religious rites and practice; they are all part of \nsituating and socialising children centring them in relation to heritage stories \nand the social significance of these texts and textures in them. Importantly, \nthe shrines enable and assert the practices of being Asian in relation to \notherness. They (shrines) represent an iconography of cultural integrity, but \ntheir dynamism allow for greater relevance to everyday life. \n 20 \n \nThe Hindu shrines trigger re-memories of sites of spiritual well being. Shilpa \ndescribes the intimacy she solicits through her shrine with the temples in \nMumbai. This labyrinthine has alleyways leading off main streets which \nhave wayside shrines which are points of congregation for Hindus. These \nshrines contribute to a landscape of righteous, moral living, which extend to \nShilpa\u201fs feelings of belonging to a dynamic and connected community. In \nher description, the alleyways have shrines, which are open day and night; lit \nand visited. When recalled, they are points which offer meaning and light \nbeyond the alienation experienced in the U.K. \n \nShilpa - \u201cEverywhere (in India) is spiritual. In alleyways there are shrines. \nYour soul gains peace, you know? Here, (in England) travelling to the \ntemple is very difficult . . . . In India you get to see people. Any place, you get \nto offer prayer. On the streets, roads you come across temples small and \nlarge.\u201d \n \nThis religious landscape extends throughout India and these shrines are \nduplicated in the home, as miniature versions. But of course, being situated \nin the home means that they exclude the social networking that public \nshrines allow. They allow connection only to the grander religious narratives \nof nation and Hinduism, but exclude the daily social and psychological \nenfranchisement that the existence of places of congregation offer. Public \ncelebrations and festivals also take place in the everyday streets and \nroadways. They are not limited to single temples or focal points. The \n 21 \ncrossroads of streets are where pedestrians join the celebrations; there is \nmusic, food and religious songs and prayer. For Shilpa it is not the event that \nis important but the fact that the streets and alleyways are all made part of the \ninclusionary landscape around. She does not feel alienated or distant. The \nreligious activity ensures an intimacy, and a sense of belonging. This is \ntranslated also in the look of the streets and commercial districts. Religious \nicons are in all the shops and shrines, there is a smell of incense and camphor \nand an aesthetic, which she has tried to replicate in her own temple at home. \nThe icons, the music and prayers through which she celebrates them are at \nthe heart of her home-life. \n \nRe-memory, and the race politics of culture. \n \nThe refraction of connection to past places, stories and genealogies through \nmaterial cultures collectively signify the absence of other people, places, and \nenvironments. Within this paper I show how new configurations of identity, \nand post-migration living, are made possible through these absences. \nMemory allows their absence to be made present through these precipitates \nof memory. The power of memory has been central to the theorisation of \nBlack Atlantic identities by Paul Gilroy (1993). To date re-memory has been \ntheorised by Morrison (1990) as a social force for whom the value of re-\nmemory is as an embodied narration of the past that is on the scale of Black \nHistory. This configuration resonates with a sense of Black Nationalism, the \nconnection across the diaspora being linked through a historical and \nbiological blackness. This is re-memories value an it\u201fs problem, in that those \n 22 \nthat it calls to are essentialised or bounded through their bodies \u2013 their \nsensory tools which recognise the metonymical signs of recall. Those who \ncan hear the sound of slave narratives are bounded through their bodily \nrecognition of it, marked as recognising a black history, and in turn being \ndefined through a biological identification. For South Asians thee is no \nsingular racialised experience, there is however a singular experience of \nmarginalisation and colonial exploitation. The self-defined imagined \ncommunity consolidates itself through this experience of migration and post-\nnational grouping which preserves a double-identification as Black British \nand Indian\/Sri Lankan\/ Pakistani\/ Kenyan and so on. \n \nRe-memory is a significant expression of double-consciousness for racialised \ngroups (DuBois 1903), experienced in the everyday, signified through \nexpressive cultures (Gilroy 1993). For post-colonial people there exists a \nconsciousness that is fractured, shifting between identification with a \nperceived utopian pre-colonial identity, and one that is shaped by an imposed \ncolonial regime of race-definition, and the lived experience of being a post-\ncolonial within Britain. It is within the arena of expressive cultures that \ndouble-consciousness has been made evident. Black artists, writers and \nmusicians have engaged with the \u201edoubleness\u201f of being within the heart of \nthe West, but figured as \u201eother\u201f within that nation\u201fs history, and society \n(Araeen 1991; 1992; hooks 1994; 1995). The history and heritage of Black \nslavery and race oppression informs a consciousness \u2013 a historically located \nconsciousness, referenced through contemporary expressive cultures, and \nwhich is expressive of the race-positioning of contemporary Black identities. \n 23 \nMorrison\u201fs re-memory is a haunting of the entire Black race by inhuman \nexperience of slavery (Finney 1998) \u201eto pursue a future without remembering \nthe past has its own deeper despair\u201f (Horovitz 1998). The experience of the \npast informs the race-positioning of all post-colonial migrants in the present, \nand the process of the activated relationship depends on the needs of the \ntellers and the listeners (Sale 1998 :3). The call and response aspect of this \nracial positioning fulfils the function of informing and anchoring current \nidentity processes with an historical memory-history that references \ntradition, heritage, and history. \n \nRe-memory is a process engaged with the \u201einterior-life\u201f of postcolonial \ngroups who are in constantly negotiating between past landscapes and the \npresent territories of citizenship. By \u201einterior-life\u201f I refer to the internalised \nexperience of rupture, alienation and non-identity, experienced in the period \nof post-migration. My concern in this paper is the relevance of the concept of \nre-memory to other post-colonial groups. Re-memory is imbued with the \nsentiments of loss, absence, but is critical in the politics of identification, \nwhich are so pertinent in contemporary global politics of migration, race, and \nheritage. The struggles of dealing with racism, fascism, and the social and \neconomic landscape of a black race-identity are present within the pain motif \nof re-memory. This reflects the \u201einterior-life\u201f of the experience of diasporic \nmigration. For British Asians, there is a complex relationship with \nBritishness. Historically, their racialised positioning within Empire and \nbeyond has figured them as outside British political identity: the Black \nEnglish subjugated and marginalised by exclusive, and partial nationalist \n 24 \npolitics (Gilroy 1987; Gilroy 1993). Re-memory being a site for the \nsustenance of the self, regenerates cultural and social collage of events; \nembodies a set of physical, emotional and geographical co-ordinates from \nwhich to forge a cultural heritage. This collage operates as a buffer to non-\nidentity, racism and marginality from the appropriation of a national culture \nand the appropriation of national landscape (Agyeman 1990; 1991; Burgess \n1996; Malik 1992; Matless 1997). \n \nThe cultural politics of re-memory \nThe intensity of re-memory\u201fs power operates as a catalyst between Black \ncommunities past and present; its presence actively shaping the tones, and \nforms of cultural expression; through language, music, text and dance. The \npain-motif in Gilroy\u201fs and Morrison\u201fs work is complex and yet singularly \ndefined by the experience of enslavement; bodily, and spiritually subjugated \nto the slave owners designs and the colonial regimes of signification and \nvalue (Fanon 1959; 1961;1967). Within this pain motif is the experience of \nrupture from family, land and biological and cultural identity. The \nsignificance of this pain motif to other post-colonial groups has yet to be \nfully researched, and it would be wrong to cite the pain-motif as equally \nmanifest amongst all post-colonial peoples, including South Asians living in \nBritain. The regimes of truth and order were, significantly too varied and \ncomplex in East Africa and India to be discussed in this way. However the \nexperience of rupture, loss, and vulnerability in social, cultural and biological \nterms has been a factor in diasporic identification. There are commonalities \nin their positioning today as post-colonial subjects, where the experience of \n 25 \nloss and rupture is translatable to the experience of British Asians. However \nthe pain motif of enslavement is demonstratably unique and particular to the \nAfrican population of enslaved men and women who appear anonymous in \nhistory but are significant in the formation of individual race-histories today. \nWithin this paper, the pain-motif is a transitory feature of South Asian re-\nmemory, however, traces exist within the text and the voices of the \nparticipants, alongside the creative, positive, and affirming qualities of \nremembering. \n \nWithin this analysis, I do not wish to conflate the South Asian and the Black \ndiaspora (as Gilroy and Morrison write of it). This is not an attempt to \ntranspose re-memory to another ethnic group, but a consideration of the \npower of re-memory in the South Asian \u201eprocesses of identification\u201f, which \nare also post-colonial, and diasporic. I wish to recover the links between the \nAsian experience of post-colonial positioning and the African-American one, \nthrough the political use of \u201eBlack-Britishness\u201f. There are simultaneously \nspecific and different formations of blackness, which commonly have their \nracism as a driving force of their constitution. \u201eAsianess\u201f is not simply a \nparallel post-colonial diaspora to the Black African diaspora; it has different \ncolonial histories and has resulted in various postcolonial geographies. The \npolitical definition of Black has expressed the ways that these solidarities \nhave been theorised and played out. Britain Asian expressive cultures have \nbeen the site of political struggles and have made a critical contribution to \nidentity discourse. As Kobena Mercer (Mercer 1990; 1990) writing about the \n1970s and 80s, states, Asian expressive cultures have been critical in the \n 26 \nmovement for race equality and justice. Other writers have expressed the \ncentral role played by Asian artists as part of a black political identification \nagainst racism and colonial \u201eregimes of truth\u201f and cultural subjugation \n(Araeen 1987; 1989; 1991; 1992; Gupta 1993; Tawdros 1989; 1993).  \n \nIn the 1970s voices such as Amrit Wilson (1978) and Pratibha Parmar were \nsignificant examples of political activists who were culturally Asian, and \npolitically Black. This was a different positioning to the Black-activists in \nthe US during the 1960s, because of political and social differences. Firstly, \nthe struggles in the 1970s were dominated by collective action from Black \nand white activists. Politically the struggle against racism was considered a \nuniversal responsibility. In this practice therefore the Asian activists were not \na distinctive group with separate interests. However since the decline of \npolitical climate of the early 1970s and 1980s this debate has been defined as \nredundant or obsolete by writers such as Tariq Modood (1990; 1994) who \nhave favoured a culturally essentialist approach. In contrast to Gilroy and \nMorrison, Modood, privileges religious cultural identity, over (firstly), the \nshared experience of Asians of racial oppression, and (secondly) the \nemployment of \u201eBlack\u201f as a political banner raised in opposition to divisive \ncultural politics. Madood diagnoses an oppression of Asians as mediated \nthrough politics of religion, as is evidenced in geopolitical rhetoric on a \nglobal scale. In contrast Gilroy\u201fs commentary is anti- (biological) \nessentialist, but he curiously concludes his thesis as a promoter of an \u201eanti-\nanti-essential race-history\u201f. This is a public race-memory, available in the \npublic sphere to those who can hear its\u201f tone. Gilroy\u201fs race politics, counters \n 27 \na class politics and embraces an understanding of cultural memory and \nheritage as located in the body \u2013 the sense of sound and an aural grammar \nonly available to a black public. This conceptual body-race-memory has \ndeveloped after Stuart Hall\u201fs term \u201enew ethnicities\u201f which he developed as a \nmeans of countering an essential race politics of \u201ecultural nationalisms\u201f that \nare not made cross-cultural in political practice.  \nVisual and material ecologies :\u2018Asianess\u2019 and its multiple provinces \n \nIn this next section I want to show how identification with \u201eAsianess\u201f is not a \nbounded, territorial, or biological ethnic experience. My focus has been to \nconsider Asianess as part of Britishness; directly linking cultural practice \nwith the geographical roots of an Asian connectivity. This dynamic, \nhistorically informed and located Asianess is lost within research on the \ncommodification of Asianess (Jackson 2002). My own attention to visual and \nmaterial cultures therefore has been about grounding a cultural practice \nwithin the context of an historical frame. I intend to ground Asian heritage \nand history in the domestic sphere. Secondly it has allowed for an analysis of \npost-colonial identity, in light of geographical mobility. The \u201ehome\u201f has the \ndualistic qualities of being situated in the present and as a place created \nthrough a family history. The \u201ehome\u201f is a prismatic device where we can \nunravel a transnational Asian identity, located in Britain, as it is constructed \nin relation to other places, journeys and past environments and landscapes. \nMy focus is the \u201einterior life\u201f. My aim here is to unravel the intense \nmemories that contribute to a sense of self in relation to a lived journey and \nlived landscapes of the past. Conceptually, re-memory posits Asianess as \ncontinually dynamic, and dialectically constructed in relation to a sense of \n 28 \n\u201ehome\u201f, \u201ehistory\u201f and place of belonging. Re-memory for South Asia\u201fs, is a \nmeans to record various locations of \u201eAsianess\u201f and the social geographies of \nthe South Asian diaspora without using a lens of biological essentialism. \n \nFigure 4 \u2013 Migration routes of all the women in the study \n \nIn the research I wanted to contextualise the effects of the sacred artefacts \nwith rather different cultures within the home. These refract a different set of \nvisualised memories, but operate similarly within the regime of a social \nhistory of the South Asian group. Landscapes that are represented or \nrefracted through craft and curios more crudely represent lived environments \nof the past which have become icons themselves. The touristic curios and \ncraft objects that the women in the groups gather in the home, have varied \nbiographies; their routes are not exactly the same as their owners, and are \noften part of the commodity culture. They are bought as \u201esouvenirs\u201f or \ndeliberately connecting devices after migration. They are situated as \nsymbolic of other lives, narratives and national identifications. For the \nwomen from East Africa animal products and dark wood sculptures featured \nquite heavily in their homes and in their stories of East Africa; copper plates, \nivory products and Masai Mara curios were all listed as valuable in their \npresence in the women\u201fs homes in England. All of these things hold a \ncultural vitality (Gell 1986,114). They are not always deemed as objects with \nfunctions, but their meanings are infused with the biography or socio-cultural \nmarkers of the owner. These curios, when living within in East Africa were \npart of the commodity markets; defined differently to their definitions in a \n 29 \nBritish context. They are imbued with a sense of Africaness, but sold as \ntourist souvenirs in a mass market of similar tokens. The women in the \ngroups make clear that these things (when living in East Africa), were \nconsidered kitch, or lacking in style. They are tacky remnants of a \ncommodified ecosystem \u2013 elephant tusks, zebra skin, ivory necklaces, \nleopard skin handbags are all examples of the splicing of the African \nsavannah into saleable touristic souvenirs. Within the British context these \nbear the prismatic qualities of the shrines, refracting memories of other lived \nlandscapes. \n \nFigure 5 Batul\u2019s African copper engraving  \nFigure 6  Shanta\u2019s African copper engraving  \nFigure 7  Shanta\u2019s African photograph \n \nBhanu - \u201cLike flamingo feathers with some ornaments on their table.\u201d \nShazia - \u201cOr those Mombassa gates in that copper, that is a must in most \nKenyan houses\u201d \nShanta - \u201cNobody used to keep it in their home. We didn\u2019t have anything \neven on the walls no. Nothing in the house, only after we left I think we are \nthinking of . . . My husband collects these David Shepherd pictures. These \nare mostly animal scenes, elephants and the African savannah feature \nlargely in all of them.\u201d  \n \nObjects bought after leaving East Africa accrue meaning in their new \ncontext. In the process of being replaced, and replanted in the U.K. these \n 30 \ntouristic curios are imbued with different values and meanings. What occurs \nis a re-construction of value (Geary 1986). Whilst living in East Africa, the \nobjects are just background things; together they, form a collage, as part of \nthe everyday, a backdrop to African life. The diasporic journey imbues them \nwith a heightened significance.  After the move they are created anew, in the \nprocess of their circulation. They may be bought as objects of little value but \nin the context of migration they are bought, given as gifts, or ordered at great \nexpense to ensure their contribution to the cultural landscape of the home in \nEngland. Their intrinsic value is limited, but their symbolic value shifts \nthrough time; their contexts reconstructed. The activation of these signs and \nsymbols occurs through the processes of remembering this \u201eother\u201f landscape \nthrough them. Their earlier value is heightened in their being dislocated \nalong with the owner, but in a social context of recognition and signification. \nThus, an elephant tusk, or a zebra skin bag, is valuable not only to the owner \npersonally, but has a role in signifying to others who see it in the home; a \nbiographical and cultural vitality which inevitably resonates with others \nwithin the community and without. They resonate with biographies, and the \nnarratives of others that inform a store of heritage values; the owners\u201f re-\nmemories are contained, refracted, and mediated through them. These curios \nbecome treasures; they are revered through their reconstruction and in turn \nreconstruct their contexts of display. Their existence changes a U.K. \ndomestic space into one where Africa as a continent is inscribed as part of \nthe valued and elevated experiences of the owners of the home. The home is \ncontextualised through the place of Africa, and the objects are contextualised \n 31 \nthrough their presence in England. The value of the object in remembering \nAfrica is simultaneously elevated reconstructed.  \n \nDarshna -\u201cIn your home do you have pieces that are always with you \nwherever you move?\u201d  \nBharti - \u201c Not religious, but some of them like the carvings of Kenya,  . .I still \nhave them. Those were the pieces that we always have in the home. .Masai \nfigures, animal. . . .the furniture I have carved, I bring from Kenya.\u201d \n Lalita \u2013 \u201cIn Mombassa, even if you go out, you know on the beach or go to \nthe streets you see people selling them you know. On the streets, kiosks, full \nof these carvings, and I think that is a kind of trademark of Kenya. And I see \nthem and it reminds you of Mombassa. . . Mombassa? The memory is \nbeautiful. . .But then I come back home . . .That\u2019s why I had to get very Asian \nfurniture.\u201d \n \nThere is a sense from some women that these located textures are essential, \nand that even if a variety of objects are collected to make home, the \u201eIndian\u201f \naesthetic has to dominate. Encounters with animals are recounted as epic \nexperiences by the women. In recalling the landscapes, the elephants and \nanimals are amplified in their, size, colour and are super-dynamic in the way \nin which they are recalled. Their size, strength and speed are vivid and made \nvital through the objects. This is not surprising considering the iconography \nof Kenya and the African Rift Valley in general; for residents the African \nNational Parks were accessible and immediate. Set off against the ecology of \nthe U.K. these memories and experiences become heightened and magnified. \n 32 \nThey are imbued with sentiment, pleasure and pride until the objects that are \nrefracting these moments are themselves elevated. The object and its own \naesthetics are valued beyond their material worth and function. These objects \nacquire value, through a form of devotion, of reverence of the memories they \nsignify. Through time these materials shift in meaning, ecologies become \nconcentrated in iconic form, distorted, extended, enhanced through new \ncontexts, and different moments. \n \nThe possession of goods, materials and objects often consolidates the \nenfranchisement to those landscapes of heritage that are refracted through the \nobjects themselves. The owning, the belonging to enhances the memories \nthat the object bears. The relationship with materials is sometimes figured \nthrough a sense of loss of land, or a way of life, distortion occurs through \ndisplacement. The sentiment of loss signifies the temporal as well as spatial \ndistance from these meaningful landscapes. Through memorialisation these \nfigure as mediators between times of lived experience and a sense of East \nAfrican heritage that contributes to British Asianess. The textures of these \ncurios are as significant as the images in them.  Handcrafted Mvuli wood \nfurniture, coasters of animals in the National Park, Copper etchings of \nelephants and ivory bracelets, make the sensory memories conflate with the \nexperience of being in England. They also evidence the necessity of \nconnecting back to these landscapes, which secure a common social history. \n \nFor many of the women the connection made through material cultures is \ndescribed as internal, as biological; a connection through gut, blood, and \n 33 \nconsciousness. This essential link is about being drawn to these textures of \nidentification to a sense of community, home and heritage sited in East \nAfrica. Possessing the curios are a way of possessing, retaining access, and \nenfranchisement to this past, both lived and remembered as a landscape of \nheritage. The act of appropriation gives back life to the object, in this new \n\u201creconstruction of value\u201d (Geary 1986) it activates connections with this past \nheritage not only through being a relic to a lost landscape, but also as a \ngateway to memories of other lives and societies. \n \nConclusions \n \nMemory theorised by Gilroy\u201fs (1993) antiphonal memory, is a system of call \nand response, unavailable to a universal ear. This memory is situated as a \ncounter-history to modernity and figures black diasporic identity in relation \nto all other discourses of history, tradition and political identity. This thesis \nhas opened up the ground for delving into an expressed double-\nconsciousness figured through a diasporic social history. To unravel the \ndialectics of the post-colonial lived experience as connected to history-\nheritage narratives, is a complex project. As I have argued in this paper lived \nenvironments harbour the precipitates of re-memory as they figure as \nnarratives of social heritage. These solid precipitates, in the form of visual \nand material cultures, help situate diasporic groups politically and socially \nwithin \u201estructures of feeling\u201f that have evolved through their varied \nrelationships with national identity. A sense of nation, belonging and \ncitizenship are figured through these active materials in the home \n 34 \nenvironment. Other textures of landscapes, narratives and social histories \nresonate through their presence. Geographical positioning is made possible \nthrough the coordinates of location they represent; the past landscapes in \ntheir present home allow for a practice of situating identity through them. \nThese identifications have infinite configurations but continue to have a \nconnective cultural significance amongst the South Asian diaspora living in \nthe UK. Re-memory adds to these geographical coordinates, by incorporating \nsocial history, not directly experienced, but which form part of the cultural \nidentity narratives which are live within the diaspora. A true understanding \nof the post-national, post-colonial experience is enabled through an \ninterrogation of \u201ehome\u201f landscapes, and their material cultures. These are a \ncritical contribution to understanding social geographies of migrant \ncommunities, which shape and reshape the social, cultural and political \nlandscape in Britain.  \n \nDiaspora although a contested term within writing about race-identity and \npost-colonial politics (Nash 2002) remains as a valuable conceptualisation of \nan imagined community where non-territorial connections are sustained \nthrough the communities\u201f sense of joined past cultural nationalism or rupture \nfrom a sense of bounded connection. For British Asians however, there is not \nalways rupture from a singular national culture or territory. Instead, \ncolonialism in the continent of Asia existed in many different nations, and \ndisrupted national cultures economies and social strata in different ways. It \nalso mobilised South Asians across the continents to labour in new territories \nof economic expansion. Colonialism was manifestly able to use cultural \n 35 \ndifferences, racial tensions, and inter-regional struggles in such ways as to \nrender this region as a set of hybrid territories of Empire. These are reflected \nin the research presented here. The South Asian diasporas sense of \nboundedness is disrupted through processes of uncovering discontinuities in \nthese differences in the roots and routes of the community, as well the \nexperience of an unsustainable biological and cultural integrity. For East \nAfrican Asians they are neither African, nor Indian. They are also culturally \nmarginal to Englishness. Therefore for them, any formulation of a \u201enational\u201f \nor \u201etraditional\u201f national culture is dependent on the domestic scale, creative \nspace where diverse configurations of \u201eAsianess\u201f can be found. These \ncontribute to the textural richness of an inclusive British heritage story, and a \nnon-essential understanding of \u201eAsianess\u201f. \n \nThe domestic sphere is an active site for the cultural identification and \npolitical positioning of British Asians. This positioning is always in context \nof a sense of rupture, not necessarily in relation to a utopian homeland, a \nbiological purity or a notion of a singular point of origin. Instead the diaspora \nis connected and sustained through a shared social memory of the experience \nof \u201elost\u201f cultural landscapes and practices, including those shaped by \nreligious philosophy. The term diaspora disrupts the fundamental logic of \nterritory to determine identity (Gilroy 1987, 328), it allows for new \nconfigurations and relationships with territories and cultural shifts, but with \nsocial memory as a connecting body of historical narrative. The diasporic \nmaterials of culture are the precipitates of their collective social memory; \ntogether forming a collage of connective landscapes, cultural iconologies and \n 36 \nsymbols of the communal experience of displacement from a sense of \nbelonging and \u201ehome\u201f. These materials represent the physical buffer between \ntheir experience of displacement and the difficulty in dealing with \nmarginalisation from new points of settlement. These cultures operate as a \npsychic investment in a set of \u201etextures of identification\u201f, they reflect this \ntransnational communities shared \u201estructures of feeling\u201f, which have various \nformations and flows dependent on the routes and roots of migration and \npoint of settlement.  \n \nSome researchers have framed this theoretically as transnationalism, \n(Vertovec 1999) drawing on a \u201etriadic relationship\u201f (Safran 1991) of fluid \nmovement of ideas and cultural values across national boundaries. Re-\nmemory bridges notions of transnationalism, with the effects on individual \nand collective consciousness that informs new identities, and new processes \nof identification. These flows across continents inscribe re-memories that \nallow for the post-colonial memories of migration to be figured through \nprocesses of identifying with a social heritage and sense of enfranchisement \nto various lands and collective memories of the journey. Precipitates of re-\nmemory allow us to view, imagine and connect with this dynamic post-\ncolonial consciousness, dialectically formed through memories of these other \nworlds and pasts, as they are figured within Britain. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \n 37 \nI would like to thank Professor Jacqueline Burgess, Ben Page, and James \nKneale at University College London for their comments on earlier versions \nof this paper and also my referees including Tariq Madood.
