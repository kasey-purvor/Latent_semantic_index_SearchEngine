Each biopile was characterised by four compartments: air, water, soil \nsolids and non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL).  Equilibrium partitioning in biopile A and B \nsuggested that most fractions reside in the NAPL, with the exception of the aromatic fraction \nwith an equivalent carbon number from 5 to 7 (EC5-7). In Biopile C, which had a higher soil \norganic carbon content (13%), the soil solid phase was the most important compartment for \nthe light aliphatic fractions (EC5-6 and EC6-8) and most of the aromatic fractions with the \nexception of the EC16-21 and EC21-35.  Although there is significant uncertainty about the rate \nof biodegradation in NAPL phase, our starting hypothesis was that hydrocarbons do not \ndegrade within the NAPL phase. This was supported by the good agreement between \npredicted and measured hydrocarbon concentrations in Biopile B when the degradation rate \nconstant in NAPL was set to zero. In all scenarios, biodegradation in the soil was predicted as \nthe dominant removal process for all fractions, except for the aliphatic EC5-6 which was lost \npredominantly via volatilisation.  Although neglecting an explicit NAPL phase in the model \nyielded a similar prediction of total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) behaviour, the predicted \nconcentrations in the air and water phases were significantly increased with consequent \nchanges in potential mobility.  Further comparisons between predictions and measured data, \nparticularly concentrations in the soil mobile phases, are required to ascertain the true value \nof including an explicit NAPL phase in models of this kind.  \n \nKeywords: oil, petroleum hydrocarbon fractions, indicator compounds, modelling, fate \nIntroduction \nPetroleum hydrocarbons are common environmental contaminants and represent a complex \nmixture of aliphatic and aromatic compounds with minor amounts of heterocyclic compounds \ncontaining nitrogen, sulphur and oxygen (Farewell-Jones, 2003; Howard et al., 2005).  Once \nreleased into the environment, most of the lower-molecular weight petroleum hydrocarbon \ncompounds are subject to volatilization, oxidation, dissolution and biotransformation \nprocesses (Pollard et al., 1994; Howard et al., 2005).  In contrast, the heavier compounds \n(boiling points ca. 300 - >600 \u00b0C and carbon number ranges > C20) are desorbed slowly into \nthe aqueous phase of the oil-soil matrix due to their low water solubility, low vapour pressure \nand high octanol water partition coefficients (KOW) (Pollard et al., 1994; Huesemann et al., \n2004). \nMany hydrocarbon contaminants have sufficiently similar intrinsic physicochemical \nproperties that they can be classed into groups or fractions when considering fate and \ntransport behaviour as well as toxicity (Twerdok, 1999; Howard et al., 2005; Foster et al., \n2005). In view of this, many jurisdictions encourage a combined indicator and fractionation \napproach for TPH analysis, separating aliphatic and aromatic substances using carbon \nnumber ranges as these are known to differ in their toxicity, solubility and fate and transport \ncharacteristics (Weisman, 1998; Brown et al., 1999; Brassington et al., 2007).  TPH risk \nassessment frameworks and criteria have been developed by, among others, Canada, the \nUnited States of America, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom (Brassington et \nal., 2007). However, these frameworks and the exposure assessments embedded within them \ndo not explicitly address the partitioning of hydrocarbon fractions and indicator compounds \nwithin the soil-oil matrix of contaminated soils. This may contribute to an overestimation of \nboth the ecotoxicological effects of the fractions and their mobility in air and water leading to \nan overestimation of health effects associated with these compounds. \nThe authors have maintained a long-standing research interest in the characterisation of \nheavy oil wastes (Pollard et al., 1992; 1994; Risdon et al., 2008) and the representativeness of \nfate and exposure models for hydrocarbon-contaminated soils (Zemanek et al., 1997; Semple \net al., 2003).  At hydrocarbon-contaminated sites, the oil is clearly the source term for risk-\ncritical contaminants.  Refractory and residual TPH (residual NAPL lodged between soil \nparticles and resistant to onward biotransformation) is a free oil phase, often retaining a \ngreater affinity than SOM for hydrophobic organics (Huesemann et al., 2004; Semple et al., \n2004).  It is frequently the principal source of organic carcinogens or suspected carcinogens \n(e.g. benzo[a]pyrene, benz[a]anthracene) that drive quantitative risk assessments at \ncontaminated sites (Weisman, 1998; Brown et al., 1999; Brassington et al., 2007).  Previous \nwork on the qualitative understanding of oil phase partitioning and co-solvency (Pollard et \nal., 1994; Zemanek et al., 1997) has shown that the role of residual NAPL in exposure \nassessment is often underestimated (especially at sites contaminated with heavy oil) and that \npetroleum hydrocarbon mobility may sometimes be over-estimated. \nApplication of fugacity models (Mackay and Paterson, 1991; Mackay, 2001) for predicting \nthe phase distribution and concentrations of organic contaminants during treatment (Pollard \net al., 2008; Coulon et al., 2009) is now proving valuable for informing exposure assessments \n(hazard and risk) and the optimization of in-situ remediation.  However, such models have \nyet to be applied to both petroleum hydrocarbon fractions and risk indicator compounds. In \naddition, the NAPL phase within biopile systems has been largely ignored (McKone, 1996; \nWalter et al., 2000; Pollard et al, 2008). \nConstructed biopiles consist of above ground heaps or cells of contaminated soils within \nwhich aerobic microbial activity is stimulated via water and nutrient addition along with \naeration (Batelle, 1996; Mohn et al., 2001).  Addition of water is often important for \nsuccessful biopile operation, particularly in arid areas where aeration can enhance water \nevaporation and reduce pile moisture content to levels which limit degradation rates.  \nBiopiles are typically constructed on an impermeable base to reduce the potential migration \nof leachate to the subsurface environment.  A perforated pipe network, installed above the \nbase, is connected to a blower that facilitates aeration of the pile (Battelle, 1996; Mohn et al., \n2001; Pollard et al., 2008).  In some cases, a leachate collection system is constructed, \nespecially if water and nutrients are added to the pile.  The piles are generally covered with \nan impermeable membrane to prevent the release of contaminants and\/or contaminated soil to \nthe environment and to protect the soil from wind and precipitation.  Biopiles operate \neffectively in temperate climates but can also be used in colder climates if warm air is \nintroduced through the aeration process (Mohn et al., 2001). \nIn this study, we explored hydrocarbon behaviour in three biopile systems, using a \nbespoke multimedia fugacity model which explicitly included a NAPL phase. Multiphase \npartitioning of the aliphatic and aromatic fractions, as well as eleven aromatic indicator \ncompounds, were modelled within the soil-oil matrix of each biopile. Our research aims were \n(i) to evaluate the implications of an explicit consideration of partitioning and degradation in \nNAPL on the predicted patterns hydrocarbon behaviour; (ii) to compare how well indicator \ncompounds represent different hydrocarbon fractions; and (iii) to explore the extent to which \neffective treatment times could be estimated using a dynamic fugacity model. \n \nMaterials and Methods \n1. Biopile characteristics and volumetric composition \nThree soils contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons were used to develop three biopile \nsystems (A, B and C), as previously described by Pollard et al. (2008).  Briefly, each biopile \nhad a volume of 624 m\n3 \nand a mass of ca. 750 tonnes.  The material in the biopile was treated \nas four environmental compartments: air, water, soil solids (with associated organic carbon \nfraction) and NAPL (Table 1). The concentration of NAPL was assumed to be equal to the \nmeasured concentration of TPH (Park and Juan, 2000).  Note that although the total volume \nof each biopile soil was the same, their composition differed.  Of particular significance was \nthe much higher soil organic carbon concentration of Biopile C (13%) compared with \nBiopiles B (6%) and A (5%).  The moisture content of the soil in Biopile C (34%) was also \nmuch higher than in soil A (15%) and B (21%) and the bulk density was lower.  It should also \nbe noted that although the TPH concentration in the three biopiles considered was relatively \nlow, suggesting that the oil may be present mainly as oil-coated soil solids, heavily \ncontaminated soils are likely to contain discrete oil-filled soil pores.  Since many \nhydrophobic contaminants have a greater affinity for the NAPL phase rather than for soil \norganic matter, an explicit NAPL compartment was therefore included in the model rather \nthan representing the oil via an increase in soil organic matter content.   \n \n2. Hydrocarbon analysis \nTPH extraction procedure and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis were carried \nout as previously described by Risdon et al. (2008). Briefly, soil samples (5 g) were \nchemically dried with 5 g of anhydrous sodium sulphate and then extracted using a sequential \nultrasonic acetone\/hexane (1:1) solvent extraction. Hydrocarbon fractions and indicator \ncompounds were identified and quantified using a Perkin Elmer AutoSystem XL gas \nchromatograph coupled to a Turbomass Gold mass spectrometer operated at 70 eV in positive \nion mode.  The mass spectrometer was operated in full scan mode (range m\/z 50-500) for \nquantitative analysis of target alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH).  \nExternal multilevel calibrations were carried out for both aliphatic and aromatic fractions \nwith quantification ranging from 0.5 to 2500 \u00b5g mL\n-1\n and from 1 to 5 \u00b5g mL\n-1\n, respectively.  \nDeuterated alkanes (C10\nd22\n, C19\nd40\n and C30\nd62\n) and deuterated PAHs (naphthalene\nd8\n, \nTable 1: Dimensions and characteristics of each biopile \n Biopile characteristics Biopile A Biopile B Biopile C \n VA (m\n3\n) 310 337 399 \n VW (m\n3\n) 91 108 122 \n VS (m\n3\n) 209 162 96 \n VNAPL (m\n3\n) 14 17 7 \n Total volume (m\n3\n) 624 624 624 \n % Total org C 7 9 15 \n % org C in soil phase 4.92 6.04 13.17 \n Soil density (kg m\n-3\n) 2400 2400 2400 \n Bulk density (kg m\n-3\n) 973 823 576 \n TPH (mg kg\n-1\n) 20848 29555 18285 \n  Aliphatic hydrocarbons (mg kg\n-1\n) 15092 19869 7271 \n  Aromatic hydrocarbons (mg kg\n-1\n) 5756 9686 11014 \n Mass in the system (kg)    \nA\nli\np\nh\na\nti\nc\n \nfr\na\nc\nti\no\nn\ns\n \nEC 5-6 nd\na\n 3 0.02 \nEC> 6-8 2 18 0.5 \nEC> 8-10 5 26 2 \nEC> 10-12 70 470 225 \nEC> 12-16 6679 7502 1574 \nEC> 16-35 2407 2186 812 \nA\nro\nm\na\nti\nc\n \nfr\na\nc\nti\no\nn\ns\n \nEC 5-7 nd 0.6 0.4 \nEC> 7-8 nd 3 1 \nEC> 8-10 4 12 8 \nEC> 10-12 16 44 21 \nEC> 12-16 588 821 647 \nEC> 16-21 1606 2195 1365 \nEC> 21-35 1281 1899 1917 \nA\nro\nm\na\nti\nc\n i\nn\nd\nic\na\nto\nr \nc\no\nm\np\no\nu\nn\nd\ns\n w\nit\nh\nin\n e\na\nc\nh\n \nfr\na\nc\nti\no\nn\n \nEC> 10-12 Naphthalene 11 22 17 \nEC> 12-16 \nAcenaphthene 11 13 10 \n1-Methylnaphthalene 15 19 16 \nEC> 16-21 \nPhenanthrene 29 33 31 \nPyrene 5 6 5 \nEC> 21-35 \nFluoranthene 6 7 6 \nBenzo[a]pyrene 3 5 3 \nBenzo[b]fluoranthene 3 3 3 \nBenzo[k]fluoranthene 3 3 2 \nChrysene 2 3 2 \nDibenzo[a,h]anthracene 1 2 1 \nnd\na\n not detected; A = air ; W = water; S = soil solids; NAPL = non aqueous phase liquid \n(oil) \n  \nphenanthrene\nd10\n, chrysened\n12\n and perylene\nd12\n) were added as internal standards at \nconcentrations of 5 and 2 \u00b5g mL\n-1\n, respectively.  For quality control, a 500 \u00b5g mL\n-1\n diesel \nstandard and mineral oil were analyzed every 10 samples. Concentration and mass in each \nbiopile system are reported in Table 1. \n \n3. Compilation of property data for hydrocarbon fractions and indicators \nPetroleum hydrocarbon fractions and indicator compounds used in this study are shown in \nTables 2 and 3, respectively. Each fraction is further divided based on its equivalent carbon \nnumber (ECn), which is either related to the boiling point (b.p.) normalized to the b.p. of the \nn-alkanes, or determined via the retention time of the compounds in a b.p. gas \nchromatography column (Twerdok, 1999). This approach has been recognized as a more \nappropriate differentiation technique than the actual carbon number of the chemical (Brown \net al., 1999; Twerdok, 1999).  For hydrocarbons with higher relative carbon number indices, \nthe disparity (in terms of EC) between aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons is substantial \n(Brassington et al., 2007).  Each hydrocarbon subset is considered to contain compounds with \nsimilar properties (Foster et al., 2005; Howard et al., 2005).  The values of the \nphysicochemical properties of the aliphatic and aromatic compounds constituting each \nhydrocarbon fraction were compiled from R\u00f8enningsen et al. (1989), TPHCWG (1999), \nMackay (2001), Foster et al. (2005) and Nathanail et al. (2007).  Biodegradation half-lives for \neach hydrocarbon compound were estimated for air, water and soil using the Estimation \nProgram Interface (EPI) Suite  for Microsoft  Windows (version 3.10) (Syracuse Research \nCorp., http:\/\/www.syrres.com\/esc\/est_soft.htm).   \nBiodegradation half-lives in NAPL are rarely, if ever, measured or predicted.  Therefore five \nscenarios were developed concerning the presence of an explicit NAPL compartment and the \ndegradation of hydrocarbons within it.  Our starting hypothesis was that petroleum \nhydrocarbons will have infinite degradation half-lives in an explicit NAPL compartment \n(Scenario 1: NAPL-No deg) owing to factors such as toxicity to microorganisms, lack of \nwater, nutrients and oxygen to support degradation.  In Scenario 2 (NAPL \u2013 Deg half rate) \nhalf-lives in NAPL were assumed to be half of those assumed for the bulk soil.  In Scenario 3 \n(NAPL-Deg), half-lives in NAPL were assumed to be equal to the respective half-lives \npredicted for the bulk soil.  In Scenario 4 (No NAPL \u2013 Enhanced SOC), no explicit NAPL \ncompartment was considered but the presence of an oil residue was captured via an increase \nin the organic carbon content (to 7, 9 and 15% respectively for Biopiles A, B, and C).  In \nScenario 5 (No NAPL), no explicit NAPL compartment was considered and soil organic \ncarbon content was not augmented to account for the presence of an oil residue. \nTo obtain half-lives for each hydrocarbon fraction which adequately represent all \nhydrocarbon components, a subset of hydrocarbons were selected for each structural class \nand carbon number.  These are given in the Supporting Information.

Evaluating environmental fate of the hydrocarbon fractions within soil-oil matrix \nA bespoke multimedia fugacity model was constructed in order to predict the prevailing \nbehaviour of the TPH fractions and indicator compounds within constructed biopile \nenvironments.  Dynamic (time-explicit) predictions were made (Mackay, 2001), because \nsteady state in the biopile is never achieved (i.e. chemical mass within the system is always \nchanging as the soil is remediated).  Each compound or fraction is characterised by its affinity \nfor the compartment under consideration via the fugacity capacity or Z-value, which is a \nfunction of compartment composition and chemical-specific partition coefficients.  The \nrelationship between the fugacity and chemical concentration is given by: \n \nC = Z.f          (2) \n \nwhere C is the concentration (mol m\n-3\n), f is the fugacity (Pa) and Z is the fugacity capacity \nwhich is the constant of proportionality, (mol m\n-3\n Pa\n-1\n). \nIndividual Z- values were calculated for water, air, soil solids and NAPL using equations \ngiven in the Supporting Information.  Although inter-compartmental transfers may limit the \nextent to which thermodynamic equilibrium can be achieved, such transfers are difficult to \ndefine within the biopile itself.  The fugacity values of each compartment within the biopile \nwere, therefore, assumed to be equal (i.e. equilibrium is achieved internally). A Z-value was \nderived for the bulk soil as the volume-fraction-weighted average of the individual \ncompartment Z-values.  This approach is in accordance with assumptions taken in other \nfugacity models developed for soil (Paterson et al., 1994; Di Guardo et al., 1994; McKone, \n1996).  At any time, t, the total amount of any single chemical contaminant inside the biopile, \nM (mole), can be expressed as follows: \n \nM(t) = f . ZBULK.VT        (3) \n \nwhere f (Pa) is the common fugacity of the contaminant fraction under consideration in the \nbiopile, ZBULK (mol Pa\n-1\n m\n-3\n) is the Z-value for the bulk soil and VT (m\n3\n) is the total volume of \nthe biopile. \n \nTransport and transformation rate coefficients in fugacity models are represented as D-values \n(mol Pa\n-1\n h\n-1\n) which have the general form for reaction of D = k.V.Z (where k is the reaction \nrate constant [h\n-1\n] and V is volume [m\n3\n]) and for advection (e.g. leaching and air flow) of D = \nG.Z (where G is the fluid flow rate [m\n3\n h\n-1\n]).  The D-values employed in the biopile model \nare given in the Supporting Information.  Note that chemicals can be transported out of the \nbiopile by three processes: (i) Diffusive transfer through the pore network followed by \nvolatilisation to the surrounding air; (ii) Advective transfer of chemical in the air-filled pore \nspace, as a consequence of air blown through the biopile and (iii) leaching (Mohn et al., \n2001; Pollard et al., 2008).  A steady-state water flow through the biopile was assumed at an \narbitrary rate of 2.1  10\n-3\n m\n3\n h\n-1\n to allow for leaching losses occurring due to periodic \nwetting, which is employed to ensure optimal moisture content for biodegradation.  \nBiodegradation of the TPH fractions was assumed to occur according to first order kinetics in \nthe bulk soil (not compartment-specific) and, independently, in the NAPL phase.  It must be \nemphasized that the above model is a highly simplified representation of the abiotic and \nbiotic processes occurring in a highly complex system.  However, the assumptions are often \ntolerable, particularly in the absence of more detailed information such as the actual form of \ndegradation kinetics taking place (Mackay, 2001). \n \nChemical diffusion to the soil surface in the air-filled and water-filled pore space, and \nsubsequent volatilization, was represented via two partial mass transfer coefficients acting in \nparallel (one for diffusion in air and one for diffusion in water) combined with a mass transfer \ncoefficient in the overlying air film.  The partial mass transfer coefficients in the soil were \nderived, in turn, from diffusion coefficients, modified for the tortuousity of the pore space \naccording to the Millington-Quirk equation (Millington and Quirk, 1961).  Further details are \ndocumented in Paterson et al. (1994), McKone (1996) and Mackay (2001).  Since we \nassumed that there were no chemical inputs to the biopile, dynamic changes in fugacity (fi) \nfor a given chemical fraction were calculated from: \n \niBULKT\niiTi\nZV\nfD\ndt\ndf\n.\n.\n        (4) \n \nwhere t (h) is time, DT  (mol Pa\n-1\n h\n-1\n) is the overall D-value (details provided in the \nSupporting Information).  Equation (4) was solved numerically using Euler\u2019s method with a \ntime step of 24 hours.  Concentrations of each hydrocarbon fraction were derived from \nEquation (2). \n \nThe total concentration (CT, mol m\n-3\n) of all fractions in the bulk soil was also calculated at \neach time step as follows: \n \nN\ni\niT tCtC\n1\n)()(\n         (5)  \nwhere Ci (mol m\n-3\n) is the concentration of fraction i and N is the number of fractions \nconsidered.  \nResults and Discussion \nEquilibrium Mass Distributions The initial mass distributions of the hydrocarbon fractions \namong compartments for each biopile are shown in Figure 1.  These distributions are \neffectively level I fugacity distributions (i.e. an equilibrium partitioning).  They suggest that \nfor many of the hydrocarbon fractions considered, the highest masses were predicted to reside \nin the NAPL and soil solid (soil organic matter) compartments.  For Biopiles A and B, the \nNAPL was predicted to be the preferred compartment for all hydrocarbon fractions, with the \nexception of the EC5-7 aromatic fraction. In Biopile C, which had a higher soil organic carbon \ncontent (13%),  soil organic matter was predicted to be the most important compartment for \nthe light aliphatic fractions (EC5-6 and EC6-8) and most of the aromatic fractions (with the \nexception of the EC16-21 and EC21-35 ). \n \nTemporal Patterns The predicted temporal patterns of TPH concentration for all three \nbiopile soils and all five scenarios are shown in Figure 2.  The predictions were much more \nsensitive to whether or not degradation was assumed for the NAPL compartment than to \nwhether or not an explicit NAPL compartment was included or not.  Predictions were also \nsensitive to degradation rate in the NAPL phase between zero (Scenario 1) and the rate \nassumed for the bulk soil (Scenarios 2 and 3) due to the preference of many of the considered \nfractions for this phase.  The predicted temporal change in TPH concentration for Scenarios 3 \n(NAPL - Deg), 4 (No NAPL \u2013 Enhanced SOC) and 5 (No NAPL) were very similar and the \ncurves for each scenario were practically indistinguishable (Figure 2). This finding confirms \nthe expectation that partitioning to the soil gas and water phases was relatively minor for the \nmost prevalent hydrocarbon fractions (e.g. the aliphatic EC>12-16 and EC>16-35 and the \naromatic EC>16-21 and EC>21-35 fractions) (Tabak et al., 1997; Foster et al., 2005). The fate of \nthese fractions in Scenarios 3, 4 and 5 was determined almost exclusively by the rate of \n  \nFigure 1: Estimated mass distribution of the petroleum hydrocarbon fractions among \ncompartments in different biopiles, assuming the existence of an explicit NAPL \ncompartment.

Changes in the lighter \naliphatic fractions were, however, influenced by the inclusion of an explicit NAPL \ncompartment in the model, resulting in a slower degradation rate (Figure 2d). This was due to \nreduced gas and water phase concentrations and associated leaching and (especially) \nvolatilization. In any given scenario, the individual hydrocarbon fractions were predicted to \ndissipate from the biopile system at very different rates, driven by their physicochemical and \ndegradation properties. The overall TPH loss patterns were closer to the \u201chockey stick\u201d curve \n(Tabak et al., 1997) rather than being exponential. Thus, care must be taken in extrapolating \noverall TPH loss as TPH tends to become dominated by the slower dissipation rates of the \nmore recalcitrant and less mobile fractions (McKone, 1996; Zemanek et al., 1997; Walter et \nal., 2000). This emphasises the importance of considering component fractions rather than \nTPH. \n \nIn Scenarios 3, 4 and 5, many of the modelled fractions were predicted to be effectively \neliminated after 10 months (7632 hours) which is in the timescale of most biopiling \noperations (~6 to 12 months) (Mohn et al., 2001; Pollard et al., 2008).  With the exception of \nthe aromatic EC>16-21 and EC>21-35 fractions and some of the PAH indicator compounds, most \nfractions in these scenarios had predicted concentrations at 10 months which were lower than \n1% of their initial concentration.  The most recalcitrant hydrocarbons were, as expected, the \naromatic EC >21-35 fraction and the heavier aromatic indicator compounds associated (>15 % \nremaining after 10 months) (Pollard et al., 1992; Zemanek et al., 1997).  \n  \n  \nFigure 2:  Predicted temporal change in TPH concentration in the three biopile soils (a, b and \nc, respectively.

For many of \nthe hydrocarbon fractions, predicted concentrations were similar to those measured.  \nConcentrations predicted by Scenario 1 (NAPL \u2013 No deg) significantly overestimated the \nmeasured concentrations for all hydrocarbon fractions on day 180 \u2013 sometimes by more than \nan order of magnitude.

In contrast, concentrations (in all \nphases) predicted in Scenarios 3, 4 and 5 were often reasonably close to the observed \nconcentrations, which is encouraging given the simple nature of the model and the \nassumptions made.  Concentrations predicted for Scenario 3 (NAPL \u2013 Deg) tended to be \nslightly higher than those predicted for Scenarios 4 and 5.  In the case of the aliphatic \nfractions, this was favourable with respect to the measured data but for the heavier aromatic \nfractions the model tended to slightly over predict measured concentrations.  The quality of \nthe match between the model prediction and the measured concentration for a given fraction \nor indicator compound is defined in Table 4 using the absolute error, expressed as a \npercentage of the measured concentration.  For most hydrocarbon fractions and for most \naromatic indicator compounds the predicted concentrations from Scenarios 3-5 were within a \nfactor 3 of measured concentrations (absolute error < 67%) and often much closer.  This \nindicates that the inclusion of an explicit NAPL, as initially postulated, was not, after all, \nessential for modelling the behaviour of many hydrocarbon fractions.  On the other hand, \ndifferences in the predicted behaviour of the lighter fractions with and without a NAPL \n(Figure 2d) suggest that, for better prediction of hydrocarbon mobility, it may still be \nadvantageous to include the NAPL with an assumption that the degradation rate in this phase \nis similar to that in the bulk soil.   \n \nImportance of Different Loss Processes The predicted contribution of different processes \n(leaching, loss in advected air, degradation in the bulk soil, degradation in the NAPL and \nTable 4 Comparison of measured and predicted concentrations (C) of the hydrocarbon fractions and the risk indicator compounds in the soil \nphase after 180 days of treatment in Biopile B.

It is clear that for the lighter fractions, particularly the aliphatic fractions (which have \nrelatively high KAW), loss to the air by advection and volatilisation is significant.  In the case of the \naliphatic EC 5-6, EC >6-8 and aromatic EC 5-7 fractions these processes were responsible for over 35% of \ntotal losses.  This finding has been also reported by Foster et al. (2005), who investigated environmental \nexposure to a mixture of gasoline products.  The predicted air phase concentrations of these fractions, \nwhich included toxic compounds such as benzene (57 mg m\n-3\n) and toluene (600 mg m\n-3\n), were relatively \nhigh (Coulon et al., 2009) and may contribute to the commonly occurring odour events at biopiling sites. \nThe air phase fluxes of risk-critical contaminants warrants further examination.  In contrast, soil-air \ntransfer was relatively unimportant for the heavier fractions, for which degradation was more important.  \nFor all fractions with ECn> 8, degradation accounted for \u2265 90% of total losses.  However, it should be \nemphasised that the absolute overall loss rate decreased with increasing molar mass (as indicated by an \nincrease in the effective median dissipation time [DT50]).  Leaching was not predicted to be a significant \nloss mechanism in terms of affecting overall soil concentrations for any of the fractions examined and \nnever exceeded 0.01% of the total loss for any fraction.  However, this was not to say that leaching will \nalways be unimportant from an environmental contamination perspective (Tabak et al., 1997; Park and \nJuan, 2000).  Concentrations in pore water were predicted to be relatively high for some fractions.  For \nexample, the highest concentrations predicted in the pore water of Biopile B after 180 days were 111 and \n499 \u00b5g L\n-1\n for the aromatic EC>16-21 fraction in Scenarios 3 (NAPL \u2013 Deg) and 5 (No NAPL), respectively \n(data not shown).  For most fractions pore water concentrations were significantly reduced by including a \nNAPL phase.  For example in Biopile B, aqueous concentrations of the different fractions considered \nwere on average 3.8 times higher in Scenario 5, when NAPL was ignored completely, compared with \nScenario 3 (NAPL \u2013 Deg).  Predicted leaching was consequently always reduced by the presence of\nTable 5: Predicted contribution of different processes and median dissipation half-lives (DT50) for representative hydrocarbon fractions \nand indicator compounds in Biopile B for Scenario 3 (NAPL \u2013 Deg) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHydrocarbon fractions and \nindicators \n% loss by \nleaching \n% loss by \nadvection in \nair \n% loss by \ndegradation in \nbulk soil \n% loss by \ndegradation in \nNAPL \n% loss by \nvolatilization \nDT50 \n(days) \n \nAliphatic        \nEC 5-6 <0.01 64 13 14 9 6 \nEC>6-8 <0.01 40 19 36 6 12 \nEC>8-10 <0.01 8 20 71 1 16 \nEC>10-12 <0.01 1 15 84 0.1 17 \nEC>12-16 <0.01 0.1 8 92 0.02 17 \nEC>16-35 <0.01 0.01 3 97 <0.01 29 \nAromatic        \nEC 5-7 <0.01 32 37 26 5 47 \nEC>7-8 <0.01 10 32 56 2 27 \nEC>8-10 <0.01 3 30 67 0.4 34 \nEC>10-12 <0.01 0.3 30 69 0.04 18 \nEC>12-16 <0.01 0.1 26 74 0.01 36 \nEC>16-21 <0.01 0.01 22 78 <0.01 56 \nEC>21-35 <0.01 <0.01 15 85 <0.01 120 \nIndicator compounds       \nNaphthalene <0.01 1 47 52 0.2 74 \nAcenaphthene <0.01 0.1 45 54 0.02 30 \n1-methylnaphthalene <0.01 4 59 36 1 29 \nPhenanthrene <0.01 0.01 38 62 <0.01 120 \nPyrene <0.01 <0.01 41 59 <0.01 120 \nFluoranthene <0.01 <0.01 40 60 <0.01 120 \nBenzo[a]pyrene <0.01 <0.01 87 13 <0.01 120 \nBenzo[b]fluoranthene <0.01 <0.01 17 83 <0.01 120 \nBenzo[k]fluoranthene <0.01 <0.01 40 60 <0.01 120 \nChrysene <0.01 <0.01 40 60 <0.01 120 \nDibenzo[a,h]anthracene <0.01 <0.01 42 58 <0.01 120 \nNAPL by at least 14% in the case of the lighter aliphatic fractions but by as much as 97% in \nthe case of the heavier aliphatic fractions.  \n \nComparison of the dissipation half-lives for the hydrocarbon fractions and their respective \nindicator compounds (e.g. compare the DT50s for EC10-12 and naphthalene) showed a \ndifference of up to 3 months (Table 5).  This finding suggests that the potential for variability \nand inherent uncertainty is high when evaluating chemical mixtures using the properties of a \nsingle compound within a multimedia model (Park and Juan, 2000; Nathanail et al., 2007). It \nshould be remembered that the values shown here represent only a small component of the \ntotal number of compounds in each fraction. \n \nConclusions \nOverall, it appears that models of this kind provide useful tools for estimating the \nenvironmental fate of hydrocarbons in soils and in biopile systems, in particular, although \nmore validation is required for a range of substances with differing physicochemical \nproperties, reactivity and transport characteristics.  The favourable (albeit limited) \nconcentration comparisons shown in Table 4 also suggest that EPI-estimated degradation \nrates are appropriate for use in models of this kind.  Unfortunately we did not measure \nhydrocarbon concentrations in the mobile biopile phases (water and air), which would have \nbeen useful for validating model predictions of advective fluxes.  Future studies of \ncontaminant behaviour in biopiles should look at these phases explicitly in order to get \nquantitative empirical estimates of the importance of different fate pathways.   The detailed \nevaluation of different fractions could facilitate the implementation of effective remediation \nat contaminated sites and help the appraisal of residual petroleum hydrocarbon levels that can \nbe left at remediated sites without posing unacceptable risk. \n Further research on the bioavailability of hydrocarbon fractions and their rate of \nbiodegradation in the NAPL is still needed to better predict when end-point remediation will \nbe reached which, in turn, will reduce the decision times as well as reducing the costs for \nchemical analysis. \n \nAcknowledgements This work was supported by the LINK Bioremediation Programme \n(BIOREM_35) and funded by the UK Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS), \nthe Environment Agency of England and Wales (EA) and the Biotechnology and Biological \nSciences Research Council BBSRC (Grant BB\/B512432\/1).
