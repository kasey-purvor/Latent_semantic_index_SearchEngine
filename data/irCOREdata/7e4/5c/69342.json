Introduction 34 \n 35 \nThe chemical and physical processes in magma are influenced by the concentration and 36 \nreaction of hydrogen-bearing components in the silicate melt.  It is well known that the 37 \nconcentrations of molecular H2O and OH\n-\n groups, hereafter referred to collectively as 38 \n\u201cwater\u201d, dissolved in magma govern the positions of mineral liquidus curves and melt 39 \nviscosities; both rise dramatically, resulting in crystallization (e.g., Geschwind and 40 \nRutherford, 1995) and melt stiffening (Hess and Dingwell, 1996), as magma degasses.  41 \nThe relationship between water and the ratio of ferric to ferrous iron in silicate melts 42 \nremains an active area of research.  In H2-buffered systems, the dissociation of water 43 \n(e.g., H2O \u2192 H2 +1\/2O2, Mueller, 1971) controls oxygen fugacity (fO2); thus aH2O 44 \ncontrols Fe\n3+\n\/Fe\n2+\n.  The effect of water as a chemical component at fixed P, T, and fO2 is 45 \nmore nuanced.  The study of (Baker and Rutherford, 1996) suggested that the Fe\n3+\n\/Fe\n2+\n 46 \nratio increased with the addition of water; however, as discussed by Wilke et al. (2005) 47 \nand Gaillard et al. (2001), the study of Baker and Rutherford was not at constant oxygen 48 \nfugacity (fO2).  Experimental studies on rhyolite (Moore et al., 1995) and basalt 49 \n(Botcharnikov et al., 2005) indicate that water, as a chemical component in a melt held at 50 \nfixed T, P, and oxygen fugacity (fO2), has no effect on the Fe\n3+\n\/Fe\n2+\n ratio.   By contrast, 51 \nother experimental studies indicate that as the bulk water content in increases so too does 52 \nthe Fe\n3+\n\/Fe\n2+\n in the melt (Gaillard et al., 2001; Gaillard et al., 2003b).  The relationship 53 \nbetween water and iron redox state in natural magmas is thus an important factor to 54 \nconsider when reconstructing redox history of degassing magma (e.g., Mathez, 1984; 55 \nBurgisser and Scalliet, 2007) or deciphering the oxidation states of magma source regions 56 \n  PAGE 1 \n(e.g., Carmichael, 1991).    57 \nMost natural magmas crystallize and vesiculate during their ascent towards and 58 \nemplacement at the Earth\u2019s surface.  Because these phase transformations redistribute and 59 \nultimately release volatile components from the system, they can drive oxidation-60 \nreduction (redox) reactions that will alter the speciation of iron in the magma. 61 \nCrystallization of silicate minerals that preferentially incorporate ferrous iron in their 62 \nstructures, such as olivine and pyroxene, result in a relatively oxidized melt residuum. 63 \nThe manner by which crystallization of non-ferrous minerals such as quartz and feldspar 64 \naffects the residual melt redox state is currently unknown; however, because these phases 65 \nare anhydrous, their growth must redistribute water in the melt (Castro et al., 2008; 66 \nWatkins et al., 2009), thereby influencing the chemical environment of iron (Gaillard et 67 \nal., 2003c).   68 \nThe release of H2 from magma, either through its continuous outward diffusion or 69 \nby liberation of H2 gas in bubbles is widely thought to oxidize lavas (e.g., Sato and 70 \nWright, 1966; Sato, 1978; Mathez, 1984; Candela, 1986; Christie et al., 1886; Holloway, 71 \n2004).  The diffusive transport of hydrogen out of the melt (m) and into bubbles (v) 72 \ndisplaces the following equilibrium to the right:  2FeO(m) + H2O (m) = H2 (v)+ Fe2O3 (m).  73 \nCrystallization of magnetite may similarly alter the oxidation state of basaltic and silicic 74 \nsystems by the \u201cauto-oxidation\u201d reaction as defined by Holloway (2004):  75 \n3Fe\n2+\nO (m) + H2O (m) = H2 (fluid) + Fe\n2+\nO\u2219Fe2\n3+\nO3 (magnetite)  (1) 76 \n  The net effect of this reaction on system redox will be determined by the degree to 77 \nwhich H2 gas exits the system.  If the hydrogen escapes the magmatic system completely 78 \n(e.g. to bubbles or the atmosphere), the system is left relatively oxidized.  If the hydrogen 79 \n  PAGE 1 \nis retained within the system, however, it may generate relatively reducing fluids adjacent 80 \nto the zone of crystallization as proposed by Holloway (2004).  Here we report adjacent 81 \nzones of oxidation and reduction in the Krafla flow on a scale of only hundreds of 82 \nmicrons. 83 \nIn this paper, we describe fine-scale optical and chemical patterns in obsidian that 84 \nlink spherulitic plagioclase, quartz, and magnetite crystallization to reduction of ferric 85 \niron in the rhyolitic melt (Fig. 1).  We show that reduced, colorless glass rims jacketing 86 \nspherulites could have been produced by the expulsion of molecular water from growing 87 \nspherulites, followed by crystallization of magnetite and concomitant production of 88 \nhydrogen.  The result is a boundary layer of reduced melt that grows with time.  Given 89 \nthe considerable sizes (>1 m; Smith et al., 2001) and high volume proportions of 90 \nspherulites in many rhyolitic lavas and ignimbrites (~90 vol.%; Stevenson et al., 1994; 91 \nTuffen and Castro, 2009; Tuffen et al., in Review) the interplay of crystallization and 92 \nmicro-scale redistribution of oxidation states has important implications for the evolution 93 \nof spherulite-rich lavas.  94 \n2. Geological Background 95 \nSpherulites are radiating, often concentrically arranged crystalline aggregates set 96 \nin a glassy matrix (Fig. 1).  They occur in obsidian domes, vitrophyric ash-flow tuffs 97 \n(e.g., Smith et al. 2001), large-volume rhyolite flows such as those at Yellowstone (e.g., 98 \nWright, 1915), and in shallow volcanic conduits (e.g., Stasiuk et al. 1996; Tuffen and 99 \nCastro, 2009).  Spherulites nucleate and grow in response to large undercoolings (> 100 \n200\u00b5C) rapidly imposed on the magma by its degassing and quenching (e.g., Swanson et 101 \nal., 1989).  As dictated by the thermal profile of a magma body (Manley, 1992; Tuffen et 102 \n  PAGE 1 \nal., in Review), spherulitic obsidian develops in spatially restricted zones (e.g., Manley 103 \nand Fink 1987; Stevenson et al. 1994), comprising a transitional facies that separates the 104 \nrapidly quenched, outermost vitrophyric rhyolite from a devitrified microcrystalline core.   105 \nAnomalously high volatile contents exist within and just above the spherulitic 106 \nzones in lava domes (e.g., Westrich et al. 1988).  Castro et al. (2008) have recently shown 107 \nthat the OH\n-\n concentrations in glass around spherulites are elevated above the background 108 \nlevel.  They interpreted these OH\n-\n concentration gradients to reflect the combined 109 \nadvection and diffusion of H2O away from the growing spherulites and numerically 110 \nmodeled these processes in order to estimate crystallization timescales.  While their work 111 \nconfirms that spherulite crystallization drives volatile enrichment in silicic glass, it 112 \nneither identifies the specific form of hydrous species ejected from the growing 113 \nspherulite, nor constrains why an iron redox shift, manifested as a sharp color difference 114 \nin the obsidian matrix (Fig. 1), is superimposed on the OH\n-\n concentration gradient in the 115 \nglass.  In this paper, we use microscopic chemical and textural evidence collected from 116 \nthe same sample studied by Castro et al. (2008) to demonstrate that regions of elevated 117 \nOH\n-\n are linked to zones of iron reduction in the glass surrounding spherulites.  This in 118 \nturn suggests that spherulite growth may cause changes in the Fe-valence state in rhyolite 119 \nmelt.  120 \n3. Analytical and experimental techniques 121 \nAll analyses were made on a decimeter-sized obsidian sample collected from the 122 \nHrafntinnuhryggur ridge system on Krafla volcano, Iceland (Tuffen and Castro, 2009).  123 \nSpherulite mineralogy was determined by 1) microscopic observation, 2) sample 124 \nmagnetism to identify Fe-oxides as magnetite, and 3) compositional data from energy 125 \n  PAGE 1 \ndispersive spectra (EDS) collected on a FEI NOVA nanoSEM600 FEG Variable Pressure 126 \nScanning Electron Microscope at the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of 127 \nNatural History, operated at 7-12 KeV, 5 mm working distance and beam current ranging 128 \nfrom 0.5-1 nA. 129 \nMajor element glass compositions were analyzed using a JEOL JXA-8900R 130 \nelectron microprobe (EPMA) running software with ZAF corrections at the Smithsonian 131 \nNational Museum of Natural History.  Analyses were performed with an acceleration 132 \nvoltage of 15 keV, a 10 \u00b5m beam, and a 10 nA beam current.  Standardization was 133 \nperformed on the following natural mineral standards:  Quartz (Si), Anorthite (Ca), 134 \nBytownite (Al), Microcline (K), Albite (Na), Hornblende (Fe, Mg).  A natural rhyolitic 135 \nglass (VG568, Obsidian Cliffs, Yellowstone, USA) of known major element composition 136 \nwas periodically analyzed to check for instrument drift.   137 \nDetermination of ferrous iron content was via wet chemical analysis of a 138 \npowdered (grain size~180 \u00b5m) obsidian aliquot chipped from the same mass of sample 139 \non which all other measurements and observations were made.  We attempted to separate 140 \nout spherulite fragments from the glass powder.  However, some glass-encrusted 141 \nspherulites may have been over looked.  Furthermore, it was not possible to separate the 142 \nthin, clear glass halos from the pervasive brown glass.  Thus, these measurements provide 143 \nan average FeO concentration for the bulk brown glass with very minor dilution by the 144 \nclear glass fraction.  A total of nine (9) analyses were performed following the technique 145 \nof Peck (1964) with some minor modifications in order to minimize oxidation during 146 \nsample digestion.  Digestion began in 8 ml of fluoroboric acid (HBF4) for 30 minutes in 147 \nthe ultrasonic bath. We then added 5 ml HF and 2 ml extra of HBF4 to the solution and 148 \n  PAGE 1 \ncompleted the digestion under heat for approximately 10 minutes.  Three ferrous iron 149 \ndeterminations were also made on the U.S.G.S. Glass Mountain Rhyolite standard RGM-150 \n1, which yielded a mean value of 1.19 wt. % FeO +\/- 0.03 (1\u03c3).   The nominal value for 151 \nRGM-1 is 1.18 wt. % FeO. 152 \nH2O concentrations were determined by synchrotron-FTIR at the Advanced Light 153 \nSource, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.  Measurements were made along 154 \ntraverses oriented perpendicular to the spherulite-glass boundaries on a Thermo Nicolet 155 \nMagna 760 FTIR spectrometer interfaced with a NicPlan IR microscope (at beamline 156 \n1.4.3).  The IR beam has a diffraction-limited diameter of about 3 \u00b5m.  The uncertainty in 157 \nspot position is + 2 \u00b5m.  Transmittance spectra were obtained over the mid-IR (1,400-158 \n4,000 cm-1) to the near-IR (3,700-6,500 cm\n-1\n) regions with MCT detectors, KBr beam-159 \nsplitters, and the synchotron light source. 128 scans were used to obtain each spectrum 160 \nand these spectra were corrected by subtracting a background spectrum collected every 161 \nhour.  We determined OH\n-\n concentrations from the intensity of the broad 3,570 cm\n-1\n 162 \nabsorption band, utilizing an absorption coefficient of 100 L mol\u2022cm\n-1\n (Newman et al. 163 \n1986).  We estimate the analytical uncertainty of OH- concentration to be + 10% of the 164 \nmeasured value. 165 \n  The oxidation state of Fe in the glass was determined at the microscale using Fe 166 \nK-edge X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (\u00b5-XANES) spectroscopy.  The area-167 \nweighted average energy of the two pre-edge peaks, or centroid, shifts to higher energy as 168 \nthe ratio of ferric to ferrous iron increases, allowing quantification of Fe\n3+\/\u2211Fe in silicate 169 \nglasses (e.g. Berry et al., 2003, Wilke et al., 2005, Cottrell et al., in press). Commensurate 170 \nwith this, the intensity of the peak corresponding to Fe\n3+\n (at higher energy) grows 171 \n  PAGE 1 \nproportionately larger relative to the intensity of the peak corresponding to Fe\n2+\n (at lower 172 \nenergy); thus the ratio of peak intensities can also be used to quantify oxidation state 173 \n(Wilke et al., 2005, Cottrell et al., in press). 174 \n Spectra were collected in fluorescence mode using a 9 element Ge array detector 175 \nand a silicon channel-cut (311) monochromator at station X26A (bending magnet) at the 176 \nNational Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), Brookhaven National Lab. The spot size on 177 \nthe sample was 9x5\u00b5m.  Spectra were recorded from 7020-7220eV with a 0.1eV step 178 \nover the pre-edge from 7106-7118eV at 5s dwell. The pre-edge was deconvolved from 179 \nthe background absorption edge by simultaneously fitting the background with a damped 180 \nharmonic oscillator function plus a line constrained to have a positive slope and the pre-181 \nedge features with two Gaussian peaks. The oxidation state of the glass was quantified 182 \nusing the empirical calibrations in Cottrell et al. (in press) based on pre-edge peak 183 \nintensity ratios measured on a series of 16 basalt reference glasses with Fe\n3+\/\u03a3Fe ratios 184 \n(0.088-0.601) independently determined by M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy and 7 rhyolitic 185 \nglasses with Fe\n3+\/\u03a3Fe ratios (0.238-0.806) independently determined by wet chemistry 186 \n(Moore et al., 1996).   187 \n We performed a heating experiment on Krafla obsidian in order to induce 188 \nspherulite crystallization and determine if optical and chemical changes in neighboring 189 \nmelt could result from this crystallization.  General experimental details are given here, 190 \nwhile more detailed experimental methods are given in the appendix.   We first heated a 2 191 \ncm-edge-length obsidian cube in a split-chamber tube furnace to 770\u02daC at a rate of 65\u02daC 192 \nmin\n-1.  The sample was held at 770\u02daC for 90 minutes.  After this period of time, the cube 193 \nwas removed from the furnace and blasted with cold compressed air, which cooled it to 194 \n  PAGE 1 \nroom temperature in about 3 minutes.  We then extracted a thin (~225 \u00b5m), doubly 195 \npolished wafer from the center of the cube and examined the glass and spherulites near 196 \nthe center of that wafer.  We also measured a water concentration profile along a traverse 197 \nextending from one of the spherulites in the wafer center.  We performed a similar 198 \nexperiment at 870\u02daC, but the hydrous melt adjacent to the spherulites vesiculated 199 \nintensely, rendering comparisons between the experimentally heated and natural 200 \nunvesiculated samples difficult.  Due to a lack of obsidian starting material, we could not 201 \nrepeat the experiment at 770\u02daC. 202 \n 203 \n4.  Results 204 \n4.1 Analytical measurements 205 \nFig.1a is a photomicrograph of a natural spherulitic obsidian wafer that is the 206 \nsubject of the measurements discussed in the following paragraphs.  The spherulites in 207 \nthis sample are composed of plagioclase and quartz (~95 vol.%), and minor amounts of 208 \nclinopyroxene (2-3 vol.%) and magnetite (<0.8 vol.%; Castro et al., 2008).  All of the 209 \nspherulites are enclosed in haloes of colorless to light brown glass, which separate them 210 \nfrom the pervasive dark brown matrix glass.  The transitions between brown and 211 \ncolorless glass tend to be sharp around the larger spherulites (radii>100 \u00b5m) whereas the 212 \nboundaries are more diffuse around the smaller spherulites. 213 \nFig. 1b shows a representative OH\n-\n concentration profile measured with 214 \nsynchrotron-FTIR by Castro et al. (2008).  The area under the profile is proportional to 215 \nthe amount of OH\n-\n groups in the silicate glass surrounding the spherulite.  Castro et al. 216 \nshowed that the OH\n-\n concentration increases with the spherulite size, and typically 217 \n  PAGE 1 \nmatches the amount of water that would be ejected during complete crystallization of 218 \nanhydrous minerals from a melt volume equal to that of the spherulite.  Differences 219 \nbetween the measured and predicted OH\n-\n contents show that some spherulites retained 220 \nwater during their growth, consistent with the presence of glass and microvesicles (Castro 221 \net al., 2008). 222 \nTable 1 shows representative major element glass compositions measured within 223 \nand across the differently colored glass regions.  These data show that the composition of 224 \nglass in the colorless halo, the transitional zone, and the distal brown glass surrounding 225 \nthe spherulite in Fig.1a are indistinguishable within analytical error.  Most importantly, 226 \nthere is no discernable change in the total iron content as the spherulite-glass boundary is 227 \napproached; i.e., glass color is not a function of the total iron content but rather the ratio 228 \nof ferric to ferrous iron.  Fig. 2 is a graph showing the major element compositions of 229 \nglass along a line traverse emanating from the spherulite shown in Fig. 1a.  230 \nBy analogy with glasses equilibrated experimentally under controlled fO2, the 231 \ncolor difference between the halo and distal glass in the natural sample was suspected to 232 \nreflect the proportions of ferric and ferrous iron, with the darker brown glass having more 233 \nferric iron than the light-colored glass (Gaillard et al. 2002; Donald et al., 2006; 234 \nMoriizumi et al., 2008).  This hypothesis was confirmed with \u03bc-XANES measurements. 235 \nSpectra were collected on the spherulite shown in figure 1a both within the clear glass 236 \nrim, approximately 20 \u03bcm from the spherulite-glass border, and in the far-field brown 237 \nmatrix glass where the OH- concentration flattens out, about 330\u00b5m from the spherulite 238 \nedge.  Figure 3ab shows the raw pre-edge spectra, model components, and total model 239 \nfits to the spectra. The spectrum taken in the distal brown glass (spot 2) displays a 240 \n  PAGE 1 \nproportionately larger Fe\n3+\n peak, indicative of a greater contribution from ferric iron. This 241 \ncan be seen even more clearly in figure 3c when the baseline subtracted spectra are 242 \nsuperimposed.   Quantitatively, the centroid (area-weighted average of the two pre-edge 243 \npeaks) shifts to higher energy by 0.18 eV moving from the clear rim to the distal brown 244 \nglass.  Consistent with this, the ratio of pre-edge peak intensities (i.e. I(Fe\n3+\n)\/I(Fe\n2+\n) 245 \nI(Fe\n3+\n)\/[I(Fe\n2+\n) + I(Fe\n3+\n)]) shift to reflect a greater contribution from ferric iron in the 246 \ndistal brown glass than in the halo, consistent with a relative change in the ratio of 247 \nFe\n3+\n\/\u2211Fe of 0.06.  The \u00b5XANES results clearly indicate a difference in the relative Fe 248 \noxidation state of the two glass regions, with the clear glass halos demonstrably reduced 249 \nrelative to the brown matrix glass.  The absolute ferric iron content determined for the 250 \ndistal brown glass (Fe\n3+\n\/\u2211Fe = 0.23\u00b10.04) compares favorably with, but is more reduced 251 \nthan, the wet chemical determination of Fe\n3+\n\/\u2211Fe = 0.29+0.02, whereas Fe in the clear 252 \nbrown glass is more reduced (Fe\n3+\n\/\u2211Fe = 0.17\u00b10.04).   253 \n Fig. 4 shows measurements of the widths of several colorless glass haloes versus 254 \ntheir corresponding spherulite radii.  Estimated uncertainties in rim widths, stemming 255 \nfrom the diffuse nature of the glass color boundaries, are shown as vertical error bars.  256 \nThe nonlinear regression to the data is a power-law function relating rim width to 257 \nspherulite radius.  Also shown in Fig. 4 are the predicted reduction rim widths for each 258 \nspherulite based on calculations using empirical relationship of Gaillard et al. (2003a), 259 \nwhich relates reduction front position or width to hydrogen fugacity, temperature (800\u02daC) 260 \nand time.  These model calculations will be discussed further below.   261 \n 262 \n4.2 Experimental results 263 \n  PAGE 1 \nThe optical character and OH\n-\n concentration of the heated obsidian are shown in 264 \nFigs. 5 and 6.  To aid comparisons with the natural state, we also include images of 265 \nunheated spherulite-rim combinations collected on the spherulite shown in Fig.1.  The 266 \ntransmitted-light photomicrographs were taken at the same illumination and focal depth, 267 \nand the imaged wafers were about the same thickness.   268 \nThe salient features and changes in the heated sample are:  1) thin, ~10 \u00b5m wide 269 \nveneers of plagioclase (identified with EDS on an SEM) jacketed all spherulites in the 270 \nsample, 2) thin brown fringes composed of glass, plagioclase, and magnetite crystals 271 \nlocated just inboard of the plagioclase veneers, 3) the colorless glass rims brigtened, and 272 \non their outer periphery, thin, light-brown glass zones developed that appear to have 273 \npropagated toward the spherulites, 4) circumferential cracks formed parallel to the 274 \ncolorless-brown glass boundaries, in some cases directly on them, and 5) along many of 275 \nthese cracks, small, ~10-30 \u00b5m, \u201cbubble-trains\u201d grew, comprising groups of spherical 276 \n(Fig. 5c) to nearly completely flattened vesicles (Fig. 5d).   277 \nThe most apparent changes that occurred during the heating experiment were 278 \ncrystallization and brightening of the colorless haloes (Fig. 5a, b).  That the 279 \ncrystallization was \u201cnew\u201d is indicated by the fact that none of the unheated spherulites 280 \nhave a jacket of feldspar around them.  The crystallization rate implied by the amount of 281 \nnew plagioclase (~1.7x10\n-9\n m sec\n-1\n; ie., width of plagioclase veneer divided by the 282 \nexperiment time) is similar to the average value (~1.9x10\n-9\n m sec\n-1\n) determined by Castro 283 \net al. (2008) from their diffusion models at 800\u02daC.   284 \nThe circumferential fractures and small vesicle trains resulted from processes 285 \noccurring, respectively, below and above the rheological glass transition (Tg).  At the 286 \n  PAGE 1 \ngiven heating rate, the sample reached Tg (~700\u02daC; Castro et al., 2008) in ~10 minutes.  287 \nDuring this short time the glass may have fractured due to its greater thermal expansion 288 \ncompared to the mineral phases in the spherulite.  If this were the case, then fractures 289 \nformed in tension as the expanding glass pulled away from the spherulite.  Once the 290 \nfractures formed, and the glass passed through Tg, bubble nucleation occurred 291 \npreferentially along the fractures, which channeled volatile components to the growing 292 \nbubbles.  The cracks apparently served as conduits for degassing of the volatile-enriched 293 \nboundary layers.  An FTIR profile (Fig. 6) measured across one of these fractures 294 \nindicates that the dissolved OH\n-\n content decreases in the vicinity of a fracture, suggesting 295 \ndegassing into that fracture.   296 \n 297 \n5.  Mechanism of Fe-reduction during crystallization 298 \n It is clear from the geometry of the colorless glass haloes, specifically their 299 \nproportional increase in width with spherulite size (Fig. 4), and their mimicking of the 300 \nspherulite shapes, that the colorless glass rims resulted from the growth of the spherulites. 301 \nThe \u00b5-XANES spectra indicate that some (~5-7% absolute or 26% relative) of the ferric 302 \niron in the glass adjacent to the spherulites has been reduced to ferrous iron (Fig. 3).    In 303 \nthis section we address how these redox changes could have occurred in light of the 304 \nanalytical and experimental evidence.   305 \nWe first consider the possibility that the heterogeneous ferric-ferrous iron 306 \ndistribution in the glass is related to the cooling history.  Metrich et al. (2006) showed 307 \nthat the ferric-ferrous ratio in peralkaline rhyolitic glass inclusions appeared to increase 308 \nupon slow cooling over several hundred \u02daC in high temperature \u00b5-XANES experiments.  309 \n  PAGE 1 \nThey attributed the apparent oxidation in XANES spectra upon cooling to a change in the 310 \ncoordination environment of iron; high temperature favors tetrahedrally coordinated 311 \nferrous iron while lower temperatures stabilize octahedrally coordinated ferric iron.  312 \nMetrich et al conclude that the XANES spectra of slowly cooled samples will appear 313 \nmore oxidized due to this coordination shift. To account for the reduced halos in the 314 \nspherulitic obsidian, the reduced halos would have had to cool much more rapidly than 315 \nthe more oxidized distal brown glass, which is physically unlikely because latent heat 316 \nliberated from the growing spherulites would have slowed cooling of the melt adjacent to 317 \nthe spherulite (Tuffen et al., submitted).  Moreover, the color change in the glass supports 318 \na real difference in the oxidation state of iron, not a coordination change.  For these 319 \nreasons, this mechanism was probably not important for the formation of the colorless 320 \nrims.   321 \nWe next consider the possibility that the reduced-Fe signature in the rims arose 322 \nfrom the late-stage crystallization of magnetite. The distribution of magnetite within 323 \nspherulites, mainly as radial aggregates sandwiched between larger domains of 324 \nplagioclase and quartz (Fig.1), suggests that magnetite grains formed in the latest stage of 325 \ncrystallization, from an interstitial melt that would have been enriched in water, further 326 \nstabilizing magnetite (Sisson and Grove, 1993).  Magnetite crystallization could act to 327 \nreduce the melt adjacent to the spherulite via two potential mechanisms. First, hydrogen 328 \nproduced by magnetite crystallization in the presence of water (i.e., \u201cauto oxidation,\u201d 329 \nreaction 1) would necessarily diffuse out of the spherulite, and would have subsequently 330 \nreduced ferric iron in the neighboring melt. Second, magnetite crystallization alone will 331 \nreduce iron in the glass residuum by virtue of its higher ferric\/ferrous ratio (just as olivine 332 \n  PAGE 1 \ncrystallization would raise the ferric\/ferrous ratio). We show below that either 333 \nmechanism, or both in concert, could have generated the reduced halos. 334 \n \u201cAuto-oxidation\u201d as described by Holloway (2004) may proceed in hydrous 335 \nsilicates when magnetite with a higher ferric\/ferrous ratio than the melt from which it is 336 \ncrystallizing becomes stable.  Pure end-member magnetite has a Fe\n3+\/\u2211Fe of about 0.67, 337 \ncompared to the value of 0.22 - 0.29 in the brown glass; therefore magnetite precipitation 338 \ncould have resulted in \u201cauto oxidation\u201d in this hydrous lava from Krafla. In this scenario, 339 \nmagnetite precipitation proceeds through the consumption of water, generating one mole 340 \nof H2 for every mole of magnetite crystallized (reaction 1).  If H2 leaves the system 341 \ncompletely through degassing along fractures, the remaining material is left relatively 342 \noxidized. As H2 diffuses through a melt, however, it necessarily results in a reduction 343 \nfront. We believe that these spherulites capture this disequilibrium state.   344 \nSimple mass balance arguments confirm the plausibility of this scenario. The 345 \nmodal proportion of magnetite in the spherulites, determined by BSE image analysis on 346 \n10 different spherulites, is about 0.3 vol.% (+0.12).  The amount of Fe\n3+\n now residing in 347 \nthe magnetite grains within the large spherulite pictured in Fig. 1a is about 0.003 mg Fe\n3+\n 348 \n(5.38x10\n-08\n moles of Fe3+), and because these magnetite grains contain some Ti (Castro 349 \net al., 2008), this estimate of Fe\n3+\n in magnetite is a maximum.  If all of the Fe\n3+\n residing 350 \nin the magnetite were created by oxidation of Fe\n2+\n in the liquid, magnetite crystallization 351 \nwould produce a maximum of 2.7x10\n-8\n moles of H2 via reaction (1). This hydrogen could, 352 \nin turn, reduce 5.38x10\n-8\n moles of ferric iron (i.e. 0.003 mg) in the adjacent melt (and 353 \nproduce water) according to: 354 \n 355 \n  PAGE 1 \nH2 (s)+ Fe2\n3+\nO3 (m\/g) = 2Fe\n2+\nO(m\/g) + H2O (m\/g) (2) 356 \n 357 \nSubscripts above refer to:  (s)-spherulite and (m\/g)-melt\/glass.  If all of the H2 358 \nwere transferred to the 100\u00b5m halo jacketing the spherulite in Figure 1a, it would shift 359 \nthe percentage of Fe\n3+ \nfrom ~22% (measured via XANES) to 9%.  We observe Fe\n3+\n in the 360 \nhalo equal to 16% (table 1), indicating  that \u201cauto-oxidation\u201d within the spherulite could 361 \nactually be responsible for iron reduction in the halo.  This calculation is a maximum 362 \nbecause it assumes that 100% of the ferric iron in the magnetite had to be converted from 363 \nFeO (i.e. reaction 1).   We observe, however, that the brown glass contains about 22% 364 \nferric iron.  Assuming that reaction (1) proceeded at 78% efficiency (i.e. 22% of the ferric 365 \niron incorporated into the magnetite was already ferric), we still find that the percentage 366 \nof Fe\n3+\n would drop to 11%.  Within the error of the XANES measurements, the 367 \nuncertainty of the reaction efficiency and mass balance, and even taking into account that 368 \nthe magnetite is Ti-bearing, this scenario remains plausible.   369 \nThe auto-oxidation scenario is also corroborated by the high concentration of 370 \nwater in the halos. We observe the number of moles of \u201cH2-equivalent\u201d currently residing 371 \nin the halo (i.e. one half the moles of OH\n-\n, calculated from the OH\n-\n concentration of 372 \n0.19% measured by FTIR) equal to 5x10\n-8\n. This is ~45% higher than the number of 373 \nmoles of H2 expected from magnetite crystallization via reaction (1).  We therefore 374 \nobserve more \u201cwater\u201d (hydroxyl and molecular) in the glass surrounding these spherulites 375 \nthan produced by magnetite crystallization. This \u201cexcess\u201d water is expected because 376 \nwater is also rejected as an incompatible element in the growing spherulite (Castro et al., 377 \n2008). 378 \n  PAGE 1 \nA second mass-balance argument can be made that magnetite precipitation alone 379 \n(i.e. not relying on the presence of water) could have caused the reduction halos.  380 \nMagnetite incorporates iron in a ratio of 2Fe\n3+\n:1Fe\n2+\n.  Only 0.4% magnetite 381 \ncrystallization (as a percent of the glass now occupied by the reduced halos) is required to 382 \ncause the ferric iron to decrease from ~22 to  the observed value of ~16%. If we assume 383 \nthat all the magnetite seen in the spherulites crystallized from the volume of glass now 384 \noccupied by the reduced halos, we observe 0.7% crystallization (which would reduce the 385 \nferric iron to 11%). If we assume that all of the magnetite seen in the sphereulites 386 \ncrystallized from the volume of glass that now comprises the volume occupied by the 387 \nspherulites plus the reduced halos, we observe 0.3% crystallization (which would reduce 388 \nthe ferric iron to 18%).  These two values therefore bracket the maximum and minimum 389 \nextents of magnetite crystallization, and either extreme provides a reasonable mechanism 390 \nby which the glass in the halos could have been reduced. Crystallization of 0.4% 391 \nmagnetite from the halo would simultaneously cause the total iron concentration (FeO) in 392 \nthe halo to fall from 3.2 to 2.8%.  This is close to within the error of the microprobe 393 \nmeasurements.  We have the added uncertainty of not knowing if the iron concentration 394 \ncould have been increased in the halo volume due to its incompatibility in early-395 \ncrystallizing quartz and plagioclase.  Nevertheless, no decrease or gradient in the iron 396 \nconcentration is observed in the halos relative to the distal brown glass.  This, combined 397 \nwith the demonstrable presence of water in the system and the likelihood of the auto-398 \noxidation reaction proceeding, leads us to slightly favor the auto-oxidation scenario as a 399 \nmeans of generating the halos, but neither can be ruled out and in fact both could have 400 \ncontributed. 401 \n  PAGE 1 \nGaillard et al. (2003a, c) simulated the process of hydrogen-flux iron reduction by 402 \nexposing natural Fe-bearing rhyolitic melt and glass cylinders to reducing atmospheres of 403 \nhydrogen and hydrogen-argon gas mixtures.  Their experiments produced many of the 404 \nfeatures we observe around the natural spherulites:  1) a sharp change in glass color 405 \nbounding a zone of reduced Fe\n3+\n\/Fetotal in hydrous glass, 2) sigmoidal OH\n-\n concentration 406 \nprofiles emanating from the sample edge and attributable to hydrogen incorporation in 407 \nthe melt followed by diffusion of molecular water along the concentration gradient, and 408 \n3) an offset between the reaction front position and the point of elevated OH\n-\n in the glass.   409 \nGaillard et al. (2003a, c) proposed that because hydrogen is very reactive with 410 \niron in the silicate melt, the reaction front progress in the melt is governed by the 411 \nsolubility and diffusion of hydrogen in the melt.  The effective diffusion rate of H2, in 412 \nturn, was limited by the fH2 of their experiments.  Gaillard et al. observed that the rate of 413 \nprogress of the reduction front (\u00b5m\u2019s\/hour) was several orders of magnitude slower than 414 \nthe expected hydrogen diffusivity (\u00b5m\u2019s\/sec) in the melt.   415 \nGaillard et al. (2003a) performed time series experiments in order to characterize 416 \nthe rate of advancement of the reduction front with time.  They observed a square-root-417 \nof-time dependence of the front position and, based on linear relationships between the 418 \nsquare of the reduction front position and run duration, they extracted reduction rate 419 \nconstants, K=\u00b5\n2\n\/t, where \u00b5 is the reaction front position, and t is time, for their 420 \nexperiments at 800\u00b0C and a range of hydrogen fugacities (0.02-50 bars).  They proposed 421 \nthat the reduction rate was limited by hydrogen incorporation, which in turn, is a function 422 \nof the fugacity-dependent H2 solubility and diffusivity in the melt. 423 \nIt is possible that the spherulites behaved in a similar manner, that is, they acted 424 \n  PAGE 1 \nas hydrogen point sources to the neighboring melt.  Although the boundary conditions are 425 \nslightly different, e.g., the spherulites are an internal, as opposed to external hydrogen 426 \nsource, the empirical kinetic data of Gaillard et al. (2003c) can be used to assess whether 427 \nthe widths of the natural reduction rims are compatible with the timescales of spherulite 428 \ngrowth.  In other words, we assume that the reduction front started moving at the onset of 429 \nspherulite growth and stopped when the growth ceased.  By this simple scenario, the rim 430 \nwidths depend on the growth timescale, and therefore the duration that the expelled 431 \nhydrogen had to react with the rhyolite melt according to the reaction rate constant K 432 \n(Gaillard et al. 2003a).   433 \nCastro et al. (2008) estimated average spherulite growth rates by modeling the 434 \ncombined advection and diffusion of water away from the growing spherulites and fitting 435 \nmodel profiles to the natural OH\n-\n concentration profiles.  Even though their model did not 436 \naccount for hydrogen incorporation in the melt and its unknown effect on the kinetics of 437 \nH2O diffusion, their growth rates match those determined experimentally on 438 \ncompositionally similar melts (e.g., Baker and Freda, 2001), and are probably accurate to 439 \nan order of magnitude.  According to their results at 800\u02daC the spherulites grew at an 440 \naverage rate of ~10\n-9\nm\/s (Castro et al., 2008), which is similar to the rate determined in 441 \nour spherulite growth experiments at 770\u02daC (appendix).  442 \nResults of rim-width calculations are shown in Fig. 4.  Individual spherulite 443 \ngrowth timescales were determined by dividing the average growth rate (800\u02daC; Castro et 444 \nal., 2008) by their spherulite radii.  Using the individual growth timescales (t), we 445 \ncalculated rim widths (\u00b5) using the relation \u00b5=(K\u2022t)1\/2. The best match between the 446 \ncalculated and natural rim widths was attained with the K value derived from the lowest 447 \n  PAGE 1 \nH2 fugacity (fH2=0.02 bar) in the experiments of Gaillard et al. (2003a).  We found a very 448 \nlarge mismatch at their next highest fH2 (~0.25 bar H2) and attribute this to the nearly one 449 \norder of magnitude increase in K at fH2=0.25 bar, which translates to comparatively rapid 450 \nrim growth relative to the spherulite growth timescales.  451 \nThe agreement between the calculated and real Fe-reduction rim widths is good, 452 \nsuggesting that the natural rims could have developed under conditions of relatively low 453 \nhydrogen fugacity (~0.02 bar according to Gaillard et al., 2003a).  This match supports 454 \nour hypothesis that it is molecular hydrogen that extrudes from the growing spherulite, 455 \nthereby fluxing the ferric iron in the neighboring melt and causing the propagation of a 456 \nredox front.  457 \n 458 \n6. Experimentally induced spherulite growth and Fe-reduction 459 \nThe experimental results of Gaillard et al (2003a, c) show that hydrogen fluxing 460 \nof a silicate melt or glass will cause reduction of the ferric iron and the formation of a 461 \nsharp reduction front that progresses with the square root of time.  The close agreement 462 \nbetween these experimental results and our natural observations suggests that the 463 \ncolorless haloes formed as a result of ferric iron reduction during spherulite growth, with 464 \nhydrogen being a permissible reductant.   465 \n 466 \n7. Conclusion 467 \nOur analysis indicates that the spherulitic growth of anhydrous phases can cause 468 \nsignificant changes in Fe-oxidation state in the neighboring melt or glass around the 469 \ngrowing crystals.  Fe-redox reactions are driven by the liberation of hydrogen, and we 470 \n  PAGE 1 \npropose that it is hydrogen produced as a product of magnetite crystallization.  The result 471 \nis an Fe-reduction reaction that propagates through the glass or melt with time.  That 472 \nspherulite crystallization can cause reduction of ferric iron in the silicate melt suggests 473 \nthat this phenomenon could prevent oxidation of silicic lavas during their emplacement 474 \ndespite extensive crystallization.   For example, Carmichael (1991) indicates that 475 \nvoluminous post-caldera rhyolite lavas at Yellowstone National Park, USA underwent 476 \nlittle to no change in redox state compared to earlier-erupted ash flows.  Carmichael 477 \n(1991) used the apparent lack of oxidation of these lavas to support his hypothesis that 478 \n\u201csilicic magmas have redox states that reflect their source regions rather than H2 loss.\u201d 479 \nHe further explained that the low bulk H2O content of the post caldera lavas could have 480 \nsuppressed the activity of the H2O as most of the water would be speciated as OH groups 481 \n(Stolper, 1982).    482 \nSpherulite crystallization is widespread in the interiors of the Yellowstone 483 \nrhyolites (Wright, 1915; Colony and Howard, 1934), with some flows containing well 484 \nover 50 vol.% spherulites (e.g., in the Nez Pierce flow).  We suggest that the lack of 485 \nvariation in redox state may have been enabled by spherulite crystallization and local 486 \nhydrogen solute rejection, but retention of generated hydrogen within the flows.  Thus 487 \nCarmichael\u2019s (1991) conclusion that \u201csilicic magmas with small amounts of iron and 488 \nlarge amounts of water do not have their redox states reset\u201d upon eruption may be a 489 \nconsequence of the offsetting effects of crystallization and glass reduction at the 490 \nmicroscale. 491 \n 492 \nAcknowledgements 493 \n  PAGE 1 \nWe thank M.C.

A) Photomicrograph of spherulites (round and elliptical, black) in obsidian 627 \n(brown).  Various analytical points and traverses are shown (emp=electron probe 628 \nmicroanalyzer; FTIR=Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy; XANES=x-ray 629 \nabsorption near-edge spectroscopy).  Black diamonds indicate approximate locations of 630 \n\u00b5-XANES measurements.  Broader dark swaths are tracks left by a laser ablation ICPMS 631 \n(these data are not discussed here).  B) A back-scattered electron image showing typical 632 \ninternal spherulite texture.  Bright phases are clinopyroxene and magnetite.  C) An OH\n-\n 633 \nconcentration profile determined by FTIR collected along the lower right traverse in 634 \nframe A.  The vertical grey line is the approximate location of the colorless-brown glass 635 \nboundary. 636 \n 637 \nFigure 2.   Major element compositions of glass leading up to a spherulite margin (at 638 \nposition = 0 \u00b5m).  All analyses were collected with an electron probe microanalyzer.  The 639 \nvertical grey bars demarcate the approximate (+10 \u00b5m) position of the colorless-brown 640 \nglass boundary. 641 \n 642 \nFigure 3.  Raw \u03bc-XANES spectra of the pre-edge region, model components,  and model 643 \n  PAGE 1 \nfits for two points within the glassy matrix depicted in Figure 1A (a) Point 1 inside the 644 \ncolorless glass halo and (b) point 2 in the distal brown glass.  (c) Model fits of the spectra 645 \nin (a) and (b) baseline-subtracted and superimposed. Approximate positions of analysis 646 \npoints are shown on the inset photomicrograph. These data show the relative changes in 647 \nratio of Fe\n2+\n to Fe\n3+\n in the colorless and brown matrix glass.  Iron in the glass near the 648 \nspherulite (point 1) is significantly reduced compared to that in the far-field brown glass 649 \n(point 2). 650 \n 651 \nFigure 4.   Colorless-glass rim width versus the apparent spherulite radius, measured on 652 \nphotomicrographs of the Krafla obsidian (solid dots).  Error in rim width, shown as 653 \nvertical bars, ranges from about 10-20%, and originates from the diffuse nature of the 654 \ncolorless-brown glass boundaries.  Regression curve is a power law function of the form:  655 \ny=2x\n0.69\n; R\n2\n=0.97.  Solid triangles are the predicted rim widths based on the 656 \nexperimentally constrained hydrogen-iron reaction rate constant of Gaillard et al. 657 \n(2003b), and the assumption that the rims developed during the interval of time that the 658 \nspherulites grew, which in turn, is taken from the growth rate data of Castro et al. (2008).   659 \n 660 \nFigure 5.  Photomicrographs (500X; 200 \u00b5m f.o.v.) collected on: A) a natural spherulite-661 \nglass combination, and B-D) an experimentally heated spherulitic obsidian.  Frame A) 662 \nshows the natural appearance of the spherulite margin (at top) and colorless and brown 663 \nglass as viewed in transmitted, plane polarized light.  The wafer is 197 \u00b5m thick.  Frame 664 \nB) shows the typical appearance of the spherulite and colorless and brown glass after 665 \nheating a similar piece of obsidian to 770\u00b5C for approximately 90 minutes.  This wafer is 666 \nabout 202 \u00b5m thick.  Note the thin veneer (~10 \u00b5m) of plagioclase coating the spherulite 667 \nmargin (upper right) and the relative brightening of the colorless glass halo.  Note also 668 \nthe crack running roughly in the center of the colorless halo with a string of small 669 \nvesicles on its tip.  Frame C) shows another view of the incipient crystallization and 670 \nvesiculation that occurred during heat treatment.  The vesicles here formed along an 671 \narcuate fracture in the colorless glass zone.  Frame D) is a backscattered electron image 672 \nof the three zones developed at the spherulite margin:  the brown microlite rich fringe (a), 673 \nplagioclase veneer (b), and the colorless and Fe-reduced matrix glass (c).  674 \n 675 \nFigure 6.   An OH\n-\n concentration profile measured along a traverse extending from a 676 \nspherulite in the heated obsidian sample.  The position of traverse is shown on the 677 \nsubjacent photomicrograph.  The vertical dashed and solid grey lines on the profile bound 678 \nthe light brown glass zone that may have formed as a result of degassing of hydrogen into 679 \nthe crack shown in the photomicrograph.  Note the coincidence between the depression in 680 \nthe OH\n-\n concentration profile and the position of the crack at ~75-80 \u00b5m.  681 \n 682 \n 683 \n 684 \n 685 \n 686 \n 687 \n 688 \n 689 \n"}
