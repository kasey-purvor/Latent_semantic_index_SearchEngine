Lett., 36, L14602, doi:10.1029\/2009GL038997.\n1. Introduction and Model Description\n[2] There is now substantial evidence that mid-latitude\nshelf-seas can make a significant contribution to the oceanic\nup-take of carbon [e.g., Thomas et al., 2004], through their\nexceptionally high primary production [e.g., Cadee and\nHegeman, 2002]. In this paper we investigate how the\ncirculation of the northwest European continental shelf\n(a broad tidally active shelf-sea, Figure 1) facilitates this\ncarbon up-take. In the hypothesis of the shelf-sea pump\n[Tsunogai et al., 1999; Yool and Fasham, 2001] carbon\nsequestered by phytoplankton growth during the spring\/\nsummer sinks below the seasonal thermocline, and this\nresults in a net-drawdown of atmospheric CO2. Below the\nseasonal thermocline heterotrophic processes generally\nremineralise the particulate organic carbon (POC) to dis-\nsolved inorganic carbon (DIC), since in tidally active seas\nonly a small fraction of the carbon is buried in the sediment\nfor long periods [Eisma and Kalf, 1987; Thomas et al.,\n2004; Wollast and Chou, 2001]. Across much of the shelf,\nthis high DIC water is initially isolated from atmospheric\nexchange by the seasonal thermocline [e.g., Rippeth, 2005].\nHowever, for this process to be an efficient method for\ncarbon draw-down over an annual cycle, this high DIC\nwater must be exported to the deep-ocean, below the\npermanent pycnocline, before the onset of the next growing\nseason. Otherwise it will inhibit the CO2 draw-down in the\nnext season. In fact observations of air-sea pCO2 gradient\nover an annual cycle demonstrate that there is indeed a net\ndraw-down of CO2 in the seasonally stratified regions of the\nNorth Sea [Thomas et al., 2004] and Celtic Sea\/Biscay\n[Frankignoulle and Borges, 2001]. Hence there is neces-\nsarily effective off-shelf carbon transport, leading to a local\nsink of carbon. The questions remains, however, what is the\nnature of this transport and does it remove carbon from the\natmosphere to the deep-ocean and hence for centennial time\nscales?\n[3] The off-shelf transport processes have yet to be\nexplicitly investigated in the context of multi-annual and\nshelf-wide scales. Observational campaigns are necessarily\nlimited to a few seasons and a particular region; in this area\nthe Malin-Hebrides shelf (LOIS\/SES 1995\u201396 [e.g., Souza\net al., 2001]), Goban Spur (OMEX I [e.g., Wollast and\nChou, 2001]) and the Iberian Margin (OMEX II [e.g.,\nHuthnance et al., 2002]). In previous modelling [Iversen\net al., 2002; Winther and Johannessen, 2006] and budgeting\n[Thomas et al., 2005] studies of the North Sea there has\nbeen a tendency to consider fluxes through the Fair Isle\nChannel and the sea between Shetland and Norway, con-\nsidering inward flow to be a transport of \u2018Atlantic\u2019 water.\nHowever, this does not directly address the ocean-shelf\nexchange and in fact reflects transport of water from the\nMalin-Hebrides shelf travelling north in the shelf edge\ncurrent from as far south as the Celtic Sea [Pingree et al.,\n1999]. Therefore for this work we concentrate on fluxes\nacross the shelf-break (\u0001200m isobath), which provides the\nnatural boundary between oceanic and shelf-sea waters.\n[4] The major transport pathway out of the North Sea is\nthe Norwegian Coastal Current (NCC; Figure 1). There\nhave been only limited observations of the vertical current\nstructure of the NCC [e.g., Johannessen et al., 1989], but\nthese concur with modelling studies [Holt and Proctor,\n2008] that the NCC has both a depth mean component\nand a strong surface intensification associated with fresher\nwater outflow from the Baltic. Hence, carbon sequestered in\nNorth Sea but transported in the surface layer of the NCC\nmight be out-gassed as this current carries water around the\ncoast of Norway. Whereas water transported in the lower\nlayer remains isolated from the atmosphere. In addition to\nthis large scale current, other, generally frictional, processes\ncan transport water off-shelf [Huthnance, 1995], particularly\nEkman draining and coastal down-welling (discussed below).\n[5] To investigate these transport processes we use a\nsimulation of the Atlantic Margin Model (AMM) [Wakelin\net al., 2009] application of the Proudman Oceanographic\nLaboratory Coastal-Ocean Modelling System (POLCOMS)\n[Holt and James, 2001]. Horizontal resolution is \u000112 km\nwith 42 s-coordinate levels in the vertical. The simulation\nperiod is 1960\u20132004 after a single year (1960) spin-up.\nSurface forcing is from ERA-40 and lateral boundary\nGEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 36, L14602, doi:10.1029\/2009GL038997, 2009\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory, Liverpool, UK.\nCopyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0094-8276\/09\/2009GL038997$05.00\nL14602 1 of 5\nconditions from a contemporary run of a \u00011\u0001 global ocean\nmodel. Freshwater discharge is provided by flow data from\n290 rivers. While this model configuration is also run\ncoupled to the European Regional Seas Ecosystem Model\n(ERSEM), here we limit the analysis to the hydrodynamic\nmodel and infer the consequences for biogeochemical\ncycles. The conclusions we reach here are largely indepen-\ndent of the details of the ecosystem.\n[6] Model validation is provided by the \u000190000 CTD\ncasts in the ICES database for this period (www.ices.dk).\nThe RMS errors are 1.1\u0001C for temperature and 0.75 for\nsalinity. Uncertainties in the velocities are estimated as by\nHolt and Proctor [2008] using the 42 drifters deployed in\nthe UK Shelf Edge Study (SES) project [Burrows et al.,\n1999]. The RMS error in current speed averaged over each\ndrifter is 0.07ms\u00021 (\u000137%) in the shelf-slope region (depths\nless than 1000m), with generally a negative (model too\nslow) bias. The fractional uncertainty in the corresponding\nEkman transport is 74%.\n2. Slope Current and the Ekman Layers\n[7] A dominant feature of the mean circulation on this\nshelf (Figure 1) is the slope current centred at the \u0001500m\nisobath [Souza et al., 2001]. It is approximately barotropic\nand thought to be driven by a combination of the poleward\ndensity change and sloping topography [Huthnance, 1984].\nDrifter observations demonstrate its continuity [Pingree et\nal., 1999] and its dispersion [Burrows et al., 1999] onto the\nshelf. The occurrence of an off-shelf Ekman drain below a\npoleward slope current has been considered in theory [e.g.,\nHuthnance, 1995] and observation [Souza et al., 2001]\nbased investigations of shelf-edge exchange. The transport\nin the Ekman layer is given by:\nQB \u00bc tBrf ; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere tB = rCduB\n2 is the bottom stress arising from the near\nbed, along slope current (uB), r is the water density, f the\nCoriolis parameter, and Cd is the drag coefficient. The\nrelation for the Ekman transport is remarkably robust since\nit is independent of the details of the internal variations of\nstress.\n[8] At the surface, the poleward along-slope component\nof wind tends to drive an on-shelf current (with a similar\ntransport expression to equation (1)). In the classic picture\nof coastal down-welling (Figure 1) the presence of the coast\nforces this water downwards. However, the lack of an\nadjacent coast (here arising from the broad North Sea,\nCeltic Sea and Irish Sea continental shelves), allows more\nFigure 1. Mean surface currents for autumn and the numbered sections following the 200m isobath used for flux\ncalculations (black and white heavy lines).

The across shelf edge transport in the\nArmorican Shelf and Celtic Sea (sections 1, 2, not shown) is\nweaker and generally on-shelf, whereas there is a strong off-\nshelf transport from the North Sea to the Norwegian Trench\n(section 5). Near 6\u0001E and 10\u0001E there are also two, approx-\nimately barotropic, intense off-shelf currents. These arise\nwhere the large scale circulation crosses the 200m isobath.\n[10] The standard deviation of the monthly mean fluxes\nintegrated around the 200m isobath (Figure 2) demonstrates\nthat the benthic Ekman layer shows very little variability.\nOn these time scales, the currents are strongly steered,\ngeostrophically and topographically, and are essentially\nuni-directional. The wind-driven surface flux is more var-\niable. The total transports are summarized in Table 1, where\nthe transport has been divided between layers above and\nbelow 180m. Together these results clearly demonstrate the\ndown-welling nature of the circulation of this shelf: water\ntends to enter the shelf at the surface and leave at depth.\n[11] The characterisation of the off-shelf transport as an\nEkman drain is apparent from the strong positive correlation\n(r2 \u0001 0.5) between the along-slope flux (section 6) and the\nlower layer flux across section 3. A simple Ekman calcu-\nlation based on the near-bed velocities around the 200m\nisobath gives a mean off-shelf transport of similar order\n(Table 1), and where the along slope current is weaker\n(sections 1 and 2), then so is the near-bed off-shelf trans-\nport. However, the temporal variability of this calculated\nEkman transport is not so well correlated with the off-shelf\ntransport. That this simple approach does not give accurate\nquantitative agreement locally is not surprising since the\nflow conditions here are far from horizontally uniform. In\ncontrast estimates of the surface Ekman transport (Table 1)\ncorrelate well with the surface currents, but do not agree so\nwell in magnitude.\n3. Ocean-Shelf Transport\n[12] The large-scale role of ocean-shelf exchange can be\ninvestigated using model tracer transport experiments. At\nthe start of each June during the 45-year simulation, a\npassive tracer field is re-initialized with a concentration of\n1\/dz m\u00023 in the lowest model s-level (thickness dz), but\nonly on-shelf in total water depths less than 200m. This\ncrudely represents the POC generated during the spring\nphytoplankton bloom that has subsequently settled below\nthe thermocline. Settling and re-suspension processes are\nnot considered further, on the assumption that either\nthe near-bed mixing is strong or the material has been\nre-mineralised to DIC. The efficiency of the shelf sea pump\ncan be characterised by the amount of material that has been\nexported from the shelf by December. By this time seasonal\nstratification has largely broken down, and its role in\nisolating bottom waters from atmospheric exchange stops.\nThe fate of material in waters that can now be mixed to the\nsurface (on time scales of hours) depends on the details of\nthe carbonate chemistry and air-sea exchange processes.\nHowever, for typical oceanic conditions the re-equilibration\ntime is usually slow (\u00018 months [Zeebe and Wolf-Gladrow,\n2001]) and similar to the transport time. Hence, the larger\nscale consequences of the shelf-sea pump can be inferred\nfrom the fraction of material that resides below the perma-\nnent pycnocline in March, i.e., has been removed from\nFigure 2. Volume transport (mean from 1960\u20132004 per length of shelf) across 3 sections shown on Figure 1 in two layers\nbelow and above 180m. Positive values indicate an on-shelf flux. Also shown (top left) is the total flux across the 200m\nisobath (sections 2\u20135). The dotted lines show 1 standard deviation of the monthly mean flux for the 45-year period.\nL14602 HOLT ET AL.: DOWN-WELLING CIRCULATION L14602\n3 of 5\ncontact with the atmosphere for long timescales before the\non-set of the next growing season.\n[13] Figure 3 clearly shows that by March all the shelf-\nedge regions have become depleted of material and that this\nhas been transported and dispersed into the deep ocean. This\nis particularly the case for the shelf adjoining sections 3 and\n4, where the transport processes illustrated in Figure 2 are\nvery effective. The shelf from Biscay to Ireland also shows\nsome off-shelf tracer transport despite the flux estimates\nacross sections 1 and 2 being small (Table 1). This indicates\na role for \u2018\u2018diffusive\u2019\u2019 horizontal transport here (e.g., tidal\nshear dispersion and fluctuating wind-forced flow).\n[14] The region of the Fair Isle current and Dooley\ncurrent, and the Dogger Bank are highly depleted, but\ngenerally the North Sea is reduced to 50\u201375% of its original\nvalue. This material is transported off-shelf both in the\nEkman drain and in the large scale circulation. Both lead\nto the NCC and hence an accumulation of material in the\nNorwegian Trench. This is supported by the presence of\nsediment deposition here [Eisma and Kalf, 1987]. In con-\ntrast to the shelf-edge regions and the North Sea, the Celtic\nSea and Irish Sea show only weak depletion. This is\nsupported by the weak residual currents observed in the\nCeltic Sea [Pingree and Cann, 1989] and the slow flushing\nof the Irish Sea [Wakelin et al., 2009].\n[15] By December, 28% of the material initialized the\nprevious June has left the shelf (inter-annual range: 20% to\n33%) and by the following March this increases to 40%\n(30% to 47%). The fraction transported off-shelf below the\npycocline by March is 19%. This is divided between 13%\n(8 to 17%) below the pycnocline in the Norwegian Trench\nand 6% (3 to 8%) below the pycnocline in the Northeast\nAtlantic. The difference arises primarily from differences in\npycnocline depth; this is much deeper in the North East\nAtlantic (200\u20131000m) than in the Norwegian Trench\n(\u000140m). It is interesting to note that the fraction exported\nto below the pycnocline in the North East Atlantic in March\nincreases from 1981 to 2004 at a (linear) rate of 0.076 \u00b1\n0.025% yr\u00021. This reflects the shoaling pycnocline over this\nperiod (by 1 \u00b1 0.25% yr\u00021).\n4. Discussion and Conclusions\n[16] This model simulation demonstrates that water tends\nto come onto the northwest European shelf near the surface\nand leave at depth. This down-welling circulation is a\nproduct of the slope current and the prevailing wind\ndirection. The slope current generates a local Ekman drain,\nwhereas the surface wind-driven on-shelf transport drives a\nshelf-scale circulation (both are shown to be reasonably\nconsistent with simple Ekman theory). The on-shelf flow\neventually forms a substantially deeper current in the\nSkagerrak and Norwegian Trench, and hence is still a\ndown-welling circulation albeit on a much larger scale.\nHere we find the down-welling circulation to be 0.9 \u00b1\n0.6 Sv (after subtracting the barotropic component). The\nuncertainty is based on a comparison with the SES drifters\non the Malin-Hebrides shelf, and its size is not surprising\ngiven the coarse resolution of this model compared with\nnarrow slope.\nTable 1.

See text for details of tracer initialization.\nL14602 HOLT ET AL.: DOWN-WELLING CIRCULATION L14602\n4 of 5\n[17] In the past, such down-welling circulation has\nreceived scant attention. But here we demonstrate that\ndown-welling has an important role in biogeochemical\ncycles since it allows transport of dissolved material from\nregions of high production to the deep ocean. Critical for\nthis role is the ability to transport water in a near-bottom\nlayer off the shelf, below the permanent pycnocline on time\nscales of less than 1 year; any longer and the increased DIC\nlevels from the last growing season will inhibit the CO2\ndrawdown of the next growing season.\n[18] In a mixed environment, the total down-welling\ncirculation (of \u00010.9 Sv) would evacuate the bottom quarter\nof the shelf (total volume \u00017.3 \u0006 1013) in \u00018 months.\nHowever, a tracer transport experiment demonstrates the\nhigh degree of heterogeneity in this transport: The shelf near\nthe ocean margin (from south of Ireland to the Norwegian\nTrench) and areas of the North Sea being most strongly\nflushed, the Celtic and Irish Seas being least. However,\nwhile the Ekman drain delivers material efficiently into the\nnortheast Atlantic, only 39% of the material transported into\nthis region by March is transported below the winter mixed\nlayer. Hence the fate of this material (as a proxy for DIC) is\nuncertain and depends on the combined efficiency of the\nvertical mixing and the air-sea exchange processes in the\ntime before the seasonal thermocline is established. Also\nthe down-welling circulation at the shelf edge may well\ntransport carbon (POC and DIC) on-shelf, where it can be\ndown-welled and exported at depth. This is a potentially\nimportant mechanism for exporting oceanic carbon that would\nnot otherwise efficiently sink-out (e.g., from picoplankton\ngrowth). Hence, the significance of shelf-sea circulation\nand carbon export on basin-wide scales cannot readily be\ndecoupled from the deep-ocean processes. In the Norwegian\nTrench, in contrast, there is shallow stratification throughout\nthe year and 61% of the material that enters this region is\ntransport below this stratification in the lower part of the\nNCC, and hence isolated from atmospheric exchange. Across\nthe whole domain 52% of the material transported off-shelf\nby March resides below the permanent pycnocline.\n[19] While we have focused here on the northwest\nEuropean continental shelf, the general principle that\nwind-driven and slope current-driven down-welling sup-\nports the export of carbon sequestered on the shelf to the\ndeep ocean is applicable to many shelf seas around the\nglobe. The details vary from region to region, but we can\nidentify this process as being potentially important in sub-\npolar seas, poleward of western boundary currents. Exam-\nples include the northeast coast of North America and the\nwestern Australian shelf, where the Leeuwin current pro-\nvides a down-welling slope current.\nReferences\nBurrows, M., S. A.
