Magnetospheric physics (current systems;\nmagnetosphere-ionosphere interactions; solar wind-\nmagnetosphere interactions)\n1 Introduction\nAnalysis of magnetometer data obtained during the three\nflybys of Saturn\u2019s magnetosphere undertaken to date, by\nPioneer-11 in 1979, and by Voyagers-1 and -2 in 1980 and\n1981, respectively, have revealed a number of surprising fea-\ntures of Saturn\u2019s magnetic field. The main surprise has been\nthat, within the limitations of the data coverage, the inter-\nnal field of the planet has been found to be closely sym-\nmetric about the spin axis, consisting of the sum of axisym-\nmetric dipole, quadrupole, and octupole terms (Connerney\net al., 1982, 1984; Davis and Smith, 1990). The internal\nfield is, therefore, entirely poloidal, with no significant az-\nimuthal components relative to the spin axis. Nevertheless,\nsmall-amplitude azimuthal fields were observed inside the\nmagnetosphere, \u223c5\u201310 nT in magnitude, which have been\nattributed to a number of effects. One such feature, de-\n1710 E. J. Bunce et al.: Azimuthal magnetic fields in Saturn\u2019s magnetosphere\nTo Sun\nMagnetopause\nDusk Dawn\nFigure 1a\n(a)\nw\nWs\nWs*\nBf\nBf\nFigure 1b\n(b)\nFig. 1. (a) Sketch looking down onto the northern pole of Saturn, showing field lines (arrowed solid lines) projected onto the equatorial\nplane. The sense of planetary rotation is anti-clockwise, as indicated. The inner field lines are shown bent into a \u2018lagging\u2019 configuration\nassociated with angular momentum transfer from the atmosphere to the magnetosphere due to sub-corotation of the magnetospheric plasma.\nThe outer field lines are shown bent away from noon, due to the effect of the magnetopause (solid line) and tail current system. (b) Sketch of\na meridian cross section through Saturn\u2019s quasi-axisymmetric inner and central magnetosphere, extending to distances of \u223c15\u201320RS in the\nequatorial plane. The arrowed solid lines indicate magnetic field lines, which are modestly distended outward from the planet by azimuthal\ncurrents (the \u2018ring-current\u2019) flowing in the near-equatorial plasma. The rotating plasma is shown by the dotted region, consisting mainly\nof protons and oxygen ions and associated electrons, which derive from water ice originating from ring grains and moon surfaces. Three\nseparate angular velocities are indicated. These are the angular velocity of a particular shell of field lines \u03c9, the angular velocity of the planet\nS , and the angular velocity of the neutral upper atmosphere in the Pedersen layer of the ionosphere, \u2217S . The value of \u2217S is expected to lie\nbetween \u03c9 and S because of the frictional torque on the atmosphere due to ion-neutral collisions. The oppositely-directed frictional torque\non the magnetospheric flux tubes is communicated to the equatorial plasma by the current system indicated by the arrowed dashed lines,\nshown here for the case of sub-corotation of the plasma (i.e. \u03c9 < S ). This current system bends the field lines out of meridian planes into\na \u2018lagging\u2019 configuration, as shown by the inner field lines in (a), associated with the azimuthal field components B\u03d5 , as shown.\nscribed by Connerney et al. (1983), was observed during\nthe Voyager-1 flyby. In this case, positive azimuthal fields\npeaking at \u223c10 nT were observed near the closest approach,\nvarying inversely with the distance from the planet\u2019s spin\naxis, in apparent association with additional perturbations in\nthe radial and latitudinal field components. Connerney et\nal. (1983) modelled these field perturbations using a field-\naligned line current of \u223c107 A, which flows along a dipole\nfield line into the southern nightside ionosphere of the planet\nat 80\u25e6 southern latitude and 21:30 LT (Local Time). Current\nclosure was taken to be via an ionospheric auroral electrojet\nfollowed by outflow in the early morning sector, though the\ndata were found not to be sensitive to the exact closure path.\nIt was also noted by Connerney et al. (1983) that this rep-\nresented one simple solution for the current system responsi-\nble, and that other configurations were possible. The physical\norigin of the current system was taken to be related to solar\nwind-induced magnetospheric convection. Other features in\nthe azimuthal field were attributed by Connerney et al. (1983)\nto the effect of field line bending due to the magnetopause-\ntail current system. In addition to these effects, Espinosa and\nDougherty (2000) have more recently pointed out the inter-\nmittent existence of oscillations in the radial and azimuthal\ncomponents of the field, which are of \u223c5 nT amplitude and\nvary on the planetary spin period of \u223c11 h. Such features\nwere clearly observed during the Pioneer-11 flyby, inbound\nand outbound, and may also have been present during the\nVoyager-2 inbound pass, but were absent during the Voyager-\n2 outbound pass and throughout the Voyager-1 flyby. With\nthe above internal field description, however, whatever their\norigin, they clearly cannot have been due directly to varia-\ntions of the internal field modulated by the spin of the planet.\nAnother source of azimuthal fields in Saturn\u2019s magneto-\nsphere which has not been quantitatively investigated to date,\nthough briefly discussed by Connerney et al. (1983), arises\nfrom the effect of plasma mass-loading and radial transport\nin the corotation-dominated inner and central regions of the\nmagnetosphere. Such azimuthal fields are very evident, for\nexample, in Jupiter\u2019s middle magnetosphere (e.g. Smith et\nal., 1976; Acun\u02dca et al., 1983; Bunce and Cowley, 2001; Khu-\nrana, 2001), associated with angular momentum transfer to\nplasma flowing outward from the Io torus (e.g. Hill, 1979,\n2001; Vasyliunas, 1983; Khurana and Kivelson, 1983; Cow-\nley and Bunce, 2001). In the case of Saturn, water-group\nmolecules which originate from ring grains and moon sur-\nfaces are ionised and picked up by the corotating flow, and\nare subsequently lost mainly either by charge-exchange or\nradial transport out of the system (e.g. Richardson, 1992;\nE. J. Bunce et al.: Azimuthal magnetic fields in Saturn\u2019s magnetosphere 1711\nRichardson et al., 1998). These processes cause the mag-\nnetospheric plasma to rotate at angular velocities less than\nthat of the planet, which, in turn, causes the field lines to\nbend into a \u2018lagging\u2019 configuration associated with angular\nmomentum transfer from the atmosphere to the magneto-\nspheric plasma. This sense of field bending is illustrated by\nthe inner field lines in Fig. 1a, which shows a view looking\ndown onto the north pole of the planet. For the case of Sat-\nurn, where the field is directed southward at the equator, the\nsense of the associated azimuthal field is negative north of\nthe equator, reversing to positive south of the equator. The\nassociated system of electric currents is illustrated by the\ndashed lines in Fig. 1b. Pedersen currents flow equatorward\nin the ionosphere, driven by the equatorward-directed elec-\ntric field of the sub-corotating flow in the neutral atmosphere\nrest frame, and close via field-aligned currents in equatorial\ncurrents which flow radially outward in the magnetospheric\nplasma. The magnetic signature of this current system is then\nthe azimuthal components marked B\u03d5 in the figure, which\nare associated with the \u2018lagging\u2019 field configuration shown\nin the inner field lines in Fig. 1a. In mechanical terms, the\ntorque associated with the j \u00d7 B force of the Pedersen cur-\nrent balances the torque on the ionosphere due to ion-neutral\ncollisions in the Pedersen layer, while the equal and opposite\ntorque associated with the j \u00d7B force of the equatorial cur-\nrent accelerates the magnetospheric plasma in the sense of\ncorotation. Overall, angular momentum is transferred from\nthe planet\u2019s atmosphere to the magnetospheric plasma. Ob-\nservations from the Voyager spacecraft have demonstrated\nthat the plasma in the central and outer regions of Saturn\u2019s\nmagnetosphere does indeed significantly sub-corotate with\nrespect to the planet (Richardson, 1986; Richardson and Sit-\ntler, 1990). Consequently, corotation-enforcement currents\nof the above nature must flow in Saturn\u2019s magnetosphere,\nsuch that the azimuthal fields they produce must contribute\nat some level to those observed.\nA second effect which must also contribute to the observed\nazimuthal field at some level, but which has also not been in-\nvestigated quantitatively, is the effect of the day-night asym-\nmetric confinement of the planetary field by the solar wind,\ni.e. the effect of the magnetopause and tail current system.\nThe sense of the field bending associated with these currents\nis shown by the outer field lines in Fig. 1, where the field lines\nare bent away from noon on either side, such as has long been\nestablished to take place in the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere (Fair-\nfield, 1968). The sense of the bending is the same as that of\nthe \u2018lagging\u2019 fields due to plasma sub-corotation in the dawn\nsector, but is in the opposite sense in the dusk sector, such\nthat the effect produces a \u2018leading\u2019 field configuration in this\ncase. It should be emphasised, however, that in the dayside\nand quasi-dipolar regime, the overall field perturbations due\nto this effect are curl-free and not related to local stresses on\nthe plasma, representing the \u2018fringing\u2019 fields of the magne-\ntopause and tail currents.\nThe principal purpose of this paper is to make quantita-\ntive estimates of the azimuthal fields inside Saturn\u2019s mag-\nnetosphere due to the two effects discussed above, and to\ncompare them with the fields observed during the space-\ncraft flybys. The calculation of the azimuthal field due to\nsub-corotation of the plasma is based on an analysis of the\nmagnetosphere-ionosphere coupling current system outlined\nabove, using theory presented in the companion paper by\nCowley and Bunce (2003). Relevant results are briefly re-\nviewed in the next section. The calculation requires knowl-\nedge of the angular velocity profile of the magnetospheric\nplasma. This information is available for the Voyager fly-\nbys, obtained from analysis of data from the PLS instruments\n(Richardson, 1986; Richardson and Sittler, 1990). However,\nonly rudimentary angular velocity information is available\nfor the Pioneer-11 flyby (Frank et al., 1980), such that we\nare unable to undertake a similar analysis of this data. Here,\ntherefore, we concentrate on the data obtained from the Voy-\nager flybys. We also require knowledge of the magnetic\nfield, and for simplicity we must use an axisymmetric model.\nTherefore, we employ the SPV internal field model of Davis\nand Smith (1990) and the ring current model of Connerney et\nal. (1983). However, in order to model the solar wind-related\neffects, we explicitly require a non-axisymmetric model and\nthus, we simply scale a data-based model of the terrestrial\nmagnetic field to Saturn. The validity of this procedure fol-\nlows from the fact that the effects are essentially due to the\nconfinement of the planetary field inside an asymmetric cav-\nity, so that the large-scale geometry of the field lines due to\nthis effect should be broadly the same in the two cases. In\nthe following sections we outline the basis on which the az-\nimuthal fields due to the above two effects have been calcu-\nlated, and then present a comparison with the fields observed.\n2 Azimuthal field due to plasma sub-corotation\nIn this section we calculate the azimuthal field associated\nwith angular momentum transfer to sub-corotating magneto-\nspheric plasma. We consider the value of the field at a point\non a field line lying between the ionosphere and the closure\ncurrents in the equatorial region. If we apply Ampe`re\u2019s law\nto a circular path passing through the point, centred on Sat-\nurn\u2019s spin (and magnetic) axis, we find immediately\nB\u03d5 = \u2213\u00b5oIhP2pi\u03c1 , (1)\nwhere the upper and lower signs correspond to conditions\nnorth and south of the equatorial current region. In this ex-\npression IhP is the equatorward-directed azimuth-integrated\nionospheric horizontal Pedersen current flowing at the feet of\nthe field lines in the hemisphere corresponding to the point in\nquestion, and \u03c1 is the perpendicular distance from the point\nto the spin axis (i.e. the cylindrical radial distance). The az-\nimuthal magnetic field in the magnetosphere thus varies on\na given field line inversely with the perpendicular distance\nfrom the spin (magnetic) axis, outside of the region where\nthe equatorial closure currents flow. Within the region of the\nclosure currents, of course, the magnitude of the azimuthal\nfield will be reduced below that given by Eq. (1), toward zero\n1712 E. J. Bunce et al.: Azimuthal magnetic fields in Saturn\u2019s magnetosphere\nnear the equatorial plane where the azimuthal field reverses\nin sign. In deriving Eq. (1) we are, of course, assuming ax-\nial symmetry of the system about the spin axis. This should\nbe a reasonable approximation to radial distances of \u223c15\u2013\n20RS in the equatorial plane, depending on the degree of ex-\ntension of the magnetosphere, compared, for example, with\ndistances of \u223c17\u201324RS to the subsolar magnetopause (Be-\nhannon et al., 1983; Maurice and Engel, 1995). Here, RS is\nSaturn\u2019s radius which we take to be 60 330 km. This value\nfor Saturn\u2019s radius is approximately the radial distance of the\n1 bar level at the equator, and has been used widely in pre-\nvious literature. For simplicity we use the same value here.\nHowever, we note that the present value of the radial distance\nof the 1 bar level at the equator recommended by the IAU is\nactually 60 268 km.\nThe azimuth-integrated horizontal Pedersen current IhP\nappearing in Eq. (1) is derived in the companion paper by\nCowley and Bunce (2003), following earlier related calcu-\nlations in the jovian context by Hill (1979) and Vasyliunas\n(1983). It is given by\nIhP (\u03b8) = 2pi6\u2217PSBipR2i (\u03b8) sin2 \u03b8\n(\n1\u2212 \u03c9\nS\n)\nfB(\u03b8) , (2)\nwhere6\u2217P is the effective height-integrated Pedersen conduc-\ntivity of Saturn\u2019s ionosphere, S is Saturn\u2019s angular velocity\n(1.638 \u00d7 104 rad s\u22121), Bip is the ionospheric field strength\nat Saturn\u2019s pole due to the dipole term alone (\u223c54 760 nT),\nRi(\u03b8) is the radial distance of the conducting layer of the\nionosphere as a function of co-latitude \u03b8 from the north pole,\n\u03c9 is the plasma angular velocity on the field line, and fB(\u03b8)\nis a magnetic field factor of order unity which contains the ef-\nfects on the ionospheric current of the non-dipole field terms,\nthe non-vertical field, and the variation of the field with lati-\ntude (see Cowley and Bunce (2003) for further details). The\neffective conductivity 6\u2217P is related to the true value 6p by\n6\u2217P = (1\u2212 k)6p , (3a)\nwhere parameter k relates to the slippage of the angular ve-\nlocity of the neutral atmosphere in the Pedersen layer \u2217S ,\nrelative to the planet S , due to the frictional torque associ-\nated with ion-neutral collisions, i.e.\n(S \u2212\u2217S) = k(S \u2212 \u03c9) , (3b)\nfor some 0 < k < 1 (see Fig. 1b and, e.g. Huang and Hill\n(1989) for a discussion in the jovian context).\nIn order to evaluate IhP from Eq. (2), and hence, to de-\ntermine the azimuthal field from Eq. (1), models of four sys-\ntem parameters need to be established. The first is the radial\ndistance of the conducting layer of the ionosphere from the\nplanet\u2019s centre, Ri(\u03b8). This is taken to be an ellipse\nRi(\u03b8) = Re\n(1+ \u03b5 cos2 \u03b8)1\/2 where \u03b5 =\n(\nRe\nRp\n)\n\u2212 1 , (4a,b)\nsuch that the radial distance varies from Rp = 55 364 km\u2248\n0.92RS at the poles to Rp = 61 268 km\u2248 1.02RS at the\nequator. These distances correspond to 1000 km above the 1\nbar reference spheroid (see the discussion in the companion\npaper).\nThe second is a model of the magnetic field, both required\nto define field quantities in the ionosphere, and to map field\nlines between the magnetosphere and the ionosphere. Here,\nthe ionospheric field has been taken to be given by the SPV\ninternal field model of Davis and Smith (1990), consisting\nof the sum of axisymmetric dipole, quadrupole and octupole\nterms, as indicated in the Introduction. In the magnetosphere,\nthe field of an axisymmetric ring current has also been added\nto the internal field, as derived by Connerney et al. (1983)\nfrom fits to the Voyager magnetometer data. Details are given\nin Sect. 2 of the companion paper.\nThe third requirement is a model of the angular veloc-\nity of the plasma normalised to the planetary angular ve-\nlocity, (\u03c9\/S). Here, we will use models derived from an\nanalysis of data from the PLS instruments on the Voyager\nspacecraft, as detailed in the companion paper in Sect. 3.\nThe data were obtained from the inbound pass of Voyager-\n1 spanning the radial distance range \u223c5\u201317RS at \u223c13:00\u2013\n15:00 MLT, the outbound pass of Voyager-1 spanning \u223c4\u2013\n8RS at \u223c02:00 MLT, and the inbound pass of Voyager-\n2 spanning \u223c4\u201320RS at \u223c13:00\u201315:00 MLT (Richardson,\n1986; Richardson and Sittler, 1990). However, the inbound\nand outbound Voyager-1 data have been combined together\non account of the relative sparseness of the data in the inner\nregion, and on the basis that axisymmetry should form a good\napproximation in this region. Overall, these data show that\nthe angular velocity of the plasma declines from near-rigid\ncorotation with the planet (i.e. (\u03c9\/S) \u2248 1) in the inner\nregion, to values of roughly half of rigid corotation at large\ndistances (see Fig. 4a of the companion paper). However, as\npreviously pointed out by Richardson (1986), the data sug-\ngest that the departure from rigid corotation starts closer to\nthe planet for Voyager-1 than for Voyager-2. We have, there-\nfore, constructed separate models for the two flybys. The\nmodels are parameterised in terms of the flux function of the\nmagnetic field, F , related to the poloidal field components by\nB = (1\/\u03c1)\u2207F \u00d7 \u03d5\u02c6 (in cylindrical co-ordinates referenced to\nthe spin (and magnetic) axis of the planet). This function is\nsuch that F = const defines a shell of field lines mapping be-\ntween the northern and southern ionospheres via the equato-\nrial plane. Definition of the angular velocity as a function of\nF thus defines the plasma angular velocity at all points within\nthe quasi-axisymmetric magnetosphere. The functional form\nemployed to model the large-scale behaviour of the angular\nvelocity is(\n\u03c9\nS\n)\n=\n(\n\u03c9\nS\n)\n\u221e\n+\n(\n1\u2212\n(\n\u03c9\nS\n)\n\u221e\n)\n1\n(1+ (Fo\/F )n) , (5)\nsuch that the plasma rigidly corotates at small radial dis-\ntances, i.e. (\u03c9\/S) \u2192 1 as F \u2192 \u221e, while the angu-\nlar velocity monotonically decreases to (\u03c9\/S)\u221e at large\ndistances where F \u2192 0. Parameter Fo determines the ra-\ndial location where the angular velocity change occurs, while\nparameter n determines the gradient of the change, becom-\ning sharper with increasing n. The parameter values cho-\nE. J. Bunce et al.: Azimuthal magnetic fields in Saturn\u2019s magnetosphere 1713\n2.5 5 7.5 10 12.5 15 17.5 20\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nw \/ Ws\nre \/ Rs\nFigure 2Fig. 2.

The solid line is the large-scale\nmodel for Voyager-1 (with small-scale features considered in the\ncompanion paper by Cowley and Bunce (2003) omitted), while the\ndashed line is the corresponding model for Voyager-2. The dotted\nline shows the condition for rigid corotation, i.e. (\u03c9\/S) = 1.\nsen to represent the Voyager-1 data are (\u03c9\/S)\u221e = 0.5,\nFo = 3200 nTR2S (corresponding to 7.4RS in the equatorial\nplane, see Fig. 2a of the companion paper), and n = 4, while\nthose for Voyager-2 are (\u03c9\/S)\u221e = 0.55, Fo = 2800 nTR2S\n(corresponding to 9.7RS in the equatorial plane), and n = 7.\nThe presence of small-scale features in the Voyager-1 profile,\ndiscussed in the companion paper, represent an unnecessary\nrefinement here and have not been included. In Fig. 2 we\nthus show the two model angular velocity profiles represent-\ning the large-scale behaviour, plotted versus distance in the\nequatorial plane. The profile for Voyager-1 is shown by the\nsolid line, while that for Voyager-2 is shown by the dashed\nline. It can be seen that the model Voyager-2 profile declines\nfrom near-rigid corotation at larger radial distances from the\nplanet than the Voyager-1 profile, as indicated above.\nThe fourth parameter we require is the effective height-\nintegrated Pedersen conductivity of Saturn\u2019s ionosphere,\npossibly reduced from the true value by atmospheric \u2018slip-\npage\u2019, as previously discussed. However, this is a very un-\ncertain parameter at the present time. Estimates of the true\nvalue based on observed and modelled ionospheric electron\ndensity profiles have yielded values varying between \u223c0.1\nand \u223c100 mho (Atreya et al., 1984; Connerney et al., 1983;\nCheng and Waite, 1988). Here, therefore, we regard 6\u2217P ef-\nfectively as a free parameter, which we wish to estimate, or\nset limits on, from fits of Eq. (1) to observed B\u03d5 data. This\ncomparison is carried out in Sect. 4.\n3 Estimating the azimuthal field due to magnetopause\nand tail currents\nHere, we now outline the method we have employed to es-\ntimate the azimuthal magnetic field in Saturn\u2019s magneto-\nsphere, which results from the effects of the magnetopause\nand tail currents. Our procedure is essentially empirical,\nbased on scaling a data-based model of the Earth\u2019s magneto-\nspheric magnetic field to Saturn. The theoretical basis of the\ncalculation is that the effects of interest are essentially due\nto the confinement of the planetary field inside an asymmet-\nric cavity formed by normal stress balance with the dynamic\npressure of the solar wind, such that to a first approximation\nthe geometry of the field lines should be preserved, relative\nto the magnetopause, in the two systems.\nSpecifically, we have used the Tsyganenko (1995, 1996)\nfield model, in which we have set the Earth\u2019s dipole to be\nanti-aligned with the spin axis, and have scaled the axial\nquadrupole and octupole fields to mimic Saturn. All other\nharmonic coefficients of the internal field have been set to\nzero. We have also chosen a \u2018standard\u2019 Earth field model,\nwith IMF Bz equal to zero, a solar wind dynamic pressure\nof 2 nPa (essentially the average value at Earth), and we con-\nsider equinox conditions with the spin and dipole axis per-\npendicular to the planet-Sun line (Saturn was near to equinox\nduring the Voyager flybys). To scale this Earth field to Saturn\nwe then simply scale positions in relation to the observed ra-\ndius of the sub-solar magnetopause, and the field magnitude\nand direction such that at small radial distances the scaled\nfield simply becomes the SPV internal field model. That is\nto say we assume\nrE =\n(\nRME\nRMS\n)\nrS and\nBS(rS) = g\n0\n1 S\ng01E\n(\nRME\nRE\nRS\nRMS\n)3\nBE(rE) , (6a,b)\ntogether with\ng02E =\n(\ng01E\ng01 S\n)(\nRME\nRE\nRS\nRMS\n)\ng02 S and\ng03E =\n(\ng01E\ng01 S\n)(\nRME\nRE\nRS\nRMS\n)2\ng03 S , (6c,d)\nwhere rE is the equivalent position vector in the Earth\u2019s mag-\nnetosphere for a given position vector rS in Saturn\u2019s magne-\ntosphere, and BS(rS) is the expected field at rS based on the\nEarth\u2019s field BE(rE) at rE . Parameter RME is the radial dis-\ntance of the Earth\u2019s subsolar magnetopause (\u223c11.1RE for\nthe model chosen, where RE = 6371.2 km), while RMS\nis the radial distance of Saturn\u2019s subsolar magnetopause,\nwhich is estimated separately from each flyby data set (and\nRS = 60 330 km). The g01 factors are the axial dipole coeffi-\ncients for Earth and Saturn, taken to be g01E = \u221229 682 nT,\nwhich is the 1995 International Geomagnetic Reference\nField (IGRF) value (Barton, 1996), and g01 S = 21 160 nT,\nwhich is the SPV value. Thus, for example, for a typical\nsubsolar magnetopause distance RMS \u2248 20RS at Saturn, we\nfind a field scaling factor BS(rS) \u223c \u22120.1BE(rE). A typical\nfield of\u223c40 nT in the near-Earth tail lobe thus transforms to a\ntypical lobe field of\u223c4 nT at Saturn, which seems reasonable\nin terms of the flyby observations (e.g. Ness et al., 1981).\n1714 E.

(6b), reproduces the observed near-planet\nstrength of the axial perturbation field due to Saturn\u2019s ring\ncurrent.

Trajectory information is\nshown for Voyagers-1 and -2 in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively.\nFigure 3 shows colour-coded trajectories projected onto the\nequatorial plane, where X points towards the Sun, and Y\nfrom dawn to dusk. The black solid line shows a model mag-\nnetopause matched to the observed inbound magnetopause(s)\n(of the same shape as used in the Tsyganenko field model),\nand the stippled area bounded by the dashed lines indicates\nthe ring current region in the Connerney et al. (1983) model.\n(The colour-coding on the trajectory refers to the nature of\nthe azimuthal field observed, as will be discussed below, red\nfor \u2018lagging\u2019, green for \u2018leading\u2019, black for near-zero, and\nblue for inbound magnetosheath.) It can be seen that both\nspacecraft entered the dayside magnetosphere in the imme-\ndiate post-noon sector at \u223c13:00 LT, and then swung round\nthe planet in the post-dusk sector, before exiting from the\ndawn magnetosphere, Voyager-1 at \u223c03:00 LT and Voyager-\n2 nearly along the dawn meridian. In terms of the mecha-\nnisms discussed above, therefore, we may expect to find ei-\nther \u2018lagging\u2019 or \u2018leading\u2019 fields on the inbound passes, de-\npending on the relative roles of the corotation-related and so-\nlar wind-related effects, though we note that the spacecraft\nwere located quite close to the noon meridian where the so-\nlar wind effect goes to zero. However, only \u2018lagging\u2019 fields\nare expected on the outbound passes, resulting from some\ncombination of both effects.\nFigure 4 shows the trajectories (red-green-black-blue\ncolour-coded) plotted in cylindrical co-ordinates on the\n(\u03c1, z) plane, showing their relationship with the field and\nplasma structures. The black lines are magnetic field lines\nobtained by adding the field of the Connerney et al. (1983)\nring current model to the SPV internal field. The model ring\ncurrent flows within the area bounded by black dashed lines.\nIt can be seen that Voyager-1 passed centrally through the\nmodel ring current region at relatively small z values south\nof the equatorial plane on its inbound pass, reached closest\napproach at a distance \u223c2RS south of the equator at a ra-\ndial distance of 3.1RS , and then moved northward across the\nequator and through the ring current region again on its out-\nbound pass. By contrast, Voyager-2 entered the magneto-\nsphere with a significant displacement north of the equato-\nrial plane, passed over the model ring current region on the\nE. J. Bunce et al.: Azimuthal magnetic fields in Saturn\u2019s magnetosphere 1715\ninbound pass, crossed the equatorial plane near closest ap-\nproach at a radial distance of 2.7RS , and then exited with an\neven larger displacement south of the equatorial plane.\nThe blue solid lines in Fig. 4 then show plasma density\ncontours, specifically of water-group ions (taken principally\nto be O+), derived from Voyager PLS data by Richard-\nson and Sittler (1990) and Richardson (1995) (though we\nnote that the analysis leading to these results used a dipole\nmagnetic field only). Heavy-ion (rather than proton) con-\ntours are shown since this component contains the major-\nity of the plasma mass on a given flux tube, and is hence\nthe most dynamically significant. The innermost contour on\nthe left of the diagram corresponds to an ion number den-\nsity of 30 cm\u22123, with subsequent contours corresponding to\n10, 3, 1, 0.3, and 0.1 cm\u22123. It is important to note that the\nheavy-ion plasma is confined to within \u223c1RS of the equato-\nrial plane at equatorial radial distances out to \u223c8RS . This\nresults primarily from the large temperature anisotropy of\nthe ions (T\u22a5 \u001d T\u2016), together with low overall ion temper-\natures (few tens to \u223c100 eV) and the confining centrifugal\neffect of the corotational flow. Since it is this plasma that\nwill carry the majority of the equatorial radial current that\ncloses the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling current cir-\ncuit in the inner part of the system, we may expect that when\nthe spacecraft are located on field lines outside of, but thread-\ning through this plasma sheet, essentially the full azimuthal\nfield given by Eq. (1) should be observed. This conclu-\nsion is reinforced by the finding by Richardson et al. (1998)\nthat the principal heavy ion loss process in the region out\nto \u223c8RS is O-O+ charge exchange, in which case we may\nexpect the principal component of the radial current to be\na \u2018pick-up\u2019 current associated with the newly-created ions.\nThe north-south distribution of this current will then be deter-\nmined by the distribution of the neutral species (derived from\nplasma sputtering of icy moons and micrometeorite erosion\nof ring grains), which is believed to be tightly confined within\n\u223c0.5\u20131RS of the equatorial plane (e.g. Johnson et al., 1989;\nPospieszalska and Johnson, 1991; Richardson et al., 1998). It\ncan be seen from the figures that Voyager-1 was continuously\nlocated south of this plasma sheet for a considerable inter-\nval (\u223c10 h) around closest approach, before passing north-\nward through the plasma sheet on its outbound pass, while\nVoyager-2 passed from the region north of the plasma sheet\non its inbound pass, through the plasma sheet near closest ap-\nproach, and then through the region south of the plasma sheet\noutbound. These represent prime intervals for the detec-\ntion of the azimuthal fields of the magnetosphere-ionosphere\ncoupling current system. Beyond \u223c8RS the plasma struc-\ntures shown in Fig. 4 may be representative of inbound day-\nside conditions only, since no plasma data are available at\nlarger distances on the dawn outbound passes due to un-\nfavourable spacecraft pointing geometries. However, the in-\nbound data indicate that in this region the ions are more dis-\ntributed along the field lines, due principally to reduced tem-\nperature anisotropies, together with increased temperatures\nand reduced angular velocities. Beyond \u223c12RS the model\ndensities are also highly spatially structured, reflecting the\n0 5 10 15 20\nr \/ Rs\n-5\n0\n5\nz \n\/ R\ns\nVoyager-1\nFigure 4a\n(a)\n0 5 10 15 20\nr \/ Rs\n-5\n0\n5\nz \n\/ R\ns\nVoyager-2\nFigure 4b\n(b)\nFig. 4.

The solid blue\nlines show contours of the heavy-ion (O+) density determined from\nthe model of Richardson and Sittler (1990) and Richardson (1995),\nbased on Voyager PLS plasma data. The innermost contour on the\nleft of the diagram corresponds to an ion density of 30 cm\u22123 (with\nmodel values between 100 and 30 cm\u22123 being shown dark grey),\nwith subsequent contours corresponding to densities of 10, 3, 1, 0.3,\nand 0.1 cm\u22123 (with values below 0.3 cm\u22123 being shown white).\nstructured plasma properties observed by the Voyagers in\nthe outer dayside regions. According to the Richardson et\nal.

In this case the current may be more distributed\nwith the plasma along the magnetospheric field lines, such\n1716 E. J. Bunce et al.: Azimuthal magnetic fields in Saturn\u2019s magnetosphere\nthat the azimuthal fields observed may then be reduced be-\nlow that expected from Eq. (1), particularly on the Voyager-1\ntrajectory which is located closer to the equatorial plane than\nfor Voyager-2.\n4.2 Comparison of observed and calculated azimuthal field\nfor plasma sub-corotation\nWe now turn to the data, and begin by comparing the ob-\nserved azimuthal magnetic field with values calculated from\nEq. (1) using the modelled plasma angular velocity profiles,\nas outlined in Sect. 2. Results for Voyager-1 and -2 are shown\nin Figs. 5 and 6, respectively, together with calculated val-\nues. The top three panels of each figure show the field com-\nponents in cylindrical co-ordinates referenced to the planet\u2019s\nspin (and magnetic) axis, while the lower three panels show\nthe corresponding spacecraft position also in cylindrical co-\nordinates, specifically \u03c1, z, and local time. Each figure shows\ntwo (Earth) days of data, spanning the interval from the in-\nbound magnetopause encounters near noon (leftmost vertical\ndashed line(s) marked \u2018MP\u2019), through the closest approach\nto the planet (central vertical dashed line marked \u2018CA\u2019), to\nradial distances of \u223c20RS outbound in the dawn magneto-\nsphere. The plots do not, therefore, encompass the outbound\nmagnetopause crossings, which were multiple in both cases\nand occurred at (spherical) radial distances of 43\u201347RS for\nVoyager-1 and 50\u201370RS for Voyager-2 (e.g. Behannon et al.,\n1983). For reference purposes, the top two panels in each fig-\nure display the radial and axial magnetic field components,\nrespectively. The SPV internal model has been subtracted\nfrom these data, such that the fields shown are those due to\nexternal sources only. Following Connerney et al. (1983),\nsome spurious values have been deleted near to the closest\napproach in each plot, where attitude reconstruction was in-\nsufficiently precise during spacecraft manoeuvers. The blue\ndotted curves in these panels show the field produced by the\nConnerney et al. (1983) ring current model, which can be\nseen to give a generally good account of these data. The\nsame colour-code is also employed in the trajectory plots in\nFigs. 3 and 4, so that it is easy to judge the spatial relation-\nships which exist between the behaviour of the azimuthal\nfield and the poloidal field and plasma structures. The third\npanels in Figs. 5 and 6 then show the azimuthal field of cen-\ntral interest here, where we note that since the internal field\nis wholly poloidal, as indicated above, the data shown in this\ncase represent the total azimuthal field measured. We fur-\nther note that since the Connerney et al. (1983) ring current\nmodel is axisymmetric, it also produces no azimuthal field.\nThe azimuthal field data are colour-coded red when, ignor-\ning rapid fluctuations, the sense of the field is consistent with\na \u2018lagging\u2019 configuration, green when it is consistent with\na \u2018leading\u2019 configuration, and black when the mean field is\nclose to zero for an extended interval. Blue indicates magne-\ntosheath\/magnetopause intervals. The dotted curves in this\npanel then show the azimuthal field computed for the plasma\nsub-corotation effect from Eq. (1), using the model parame-\nters discussed in Sect. 2. As explained above, the value of the\neffective ionospheric Pedersen conductivity is treated essen-\ntially as a free parameter. The lower and upper blue dotted\nlines in these panels correspond to values of 1 and 2 mho,\nrespectively.\nOverall, it can be seen that the calculated fields for 6\u2217P =\n1 \u2212 2 mho encompass the observed values quite well when\nthe latter are consistent with a \u2018lagging\u2019 configuration. How-\never, it can also be seen that there are extended intervals,\non the inbound passes particularly, where the observed field\nis instead consistent with a \u2018leading\u2019 configuration. In fact,\ncareful examination of these plots in conjunction with Figs. 3\nand 4 indicates a rather consistent picture for the two flybys.\nIt can be seen first of all that there is a region extending in-\nwards from the inbound magnetopause, where the azimuthal\nfields are either small and fluctuating, as for Voyager-1 near\nthe equatorial plane, or are in the sense of a \u2018leading\u2019 field,\nas for Voyager-2 well off the equatorial plane. These obser-\nvations are then consistent in sense with field bending due\nto solar wind-related effects, an aspect that will be inves-\ntigated quantitatively below. The azimuthal fields then re-\nverse sense to become variable but typically \u2018lagging\u2019 and\nconsistent with the calculated field for 6\u2217P \u2248 1 \u2212 2 mho\nin a region of the outer magnetosphere, where the plasma\nconditions are variable according to the plasma model of\nRichardson and Sittler (1990) and Richardson (1995). For\nVoyager-1 this region lies at cylindrical radial distances of\n\u223c15\u201317RS , while for Voyager-2 it is more extended radi-\nally but lies closer to the planet at \u223c10\u201315RS . Inside this\nregion of relative agreement with Eq. (1) there then exists a\nfurther region of \u2018leading\u2019 fields, which is relatively weak for\nVoyager-1, located \u223c1\u20132RS south of the equatorial plane,\nand relatively strong for Voyager-2, located \u223c3\u20134RS north\nof the equatorial plane. We note from Figs. 3 and 4 that in\nboth cases this corresponds to the interval when the space-\ncraft was passing through or immediately adjacent to the ring\ncurrent region (as can also be seen from the variations in the\nBz field component in the upper panels of Figs. 5 and 6),\nwhere the plasma is more distributed along the field lines\nin the Richardson and Sittler (1990) and Richardson (1995)\nplasma model. We noted above that the \u2018lagging\u2019 fields due\nto the magnetosphere-ionosphere current could be weakened\nin this region, compared with that given by Eq. (1). The like-\nlihood that the observed oppositely-directed \u2018leading\u2019 fields\nwere produced by the solar wind effect will be investigated\nbelow. We note, however, that the azimuthal field variations\nobserved during the inbound Voyager-2 pass were attributed\nto the 10-h periodic perturbation (of unknown origin) by Es-\npinosa and Dougherty (2000).\nIt can also be seen in Figs. 5 and 6 that the observed and\ncalculated azimuthal fields are also in reasonable agreement\nin the inner part of the magnetosphere. On the inbound pass\nthis statement applies to the intervals when the spacecraft\nwere located on field lines mapping to the equatorial plane\nwithin \u223c8RS of the planet, and hence, were located on field\nlines threading the thin equatorial plasma sheet. The blue\ndotted curve in the fourth panel of the figures shows the equa-\ntorial crossing distance of the field line passing through the\nE. J.

Plot showing magnetic field and spacecraft position data for the Saturn flyby of Voyager-1. Two (Earth) days of data are shown,\ncorresponding to days 317 and 318 of 1980. The top three panels show the residual field components in cylindrical co-ordinates referenced to\nthe planet\u2019s spin (and magnetic) axis, that is, from the top downwards, B\u03c1 , Bz, and B\u03d5 (in nT). These residuals are the measured field minus\nthe SPV model of the internal planetary field (which is zero in the case of the azimuthal component). The azimuthal field data are colour-\ncoded according to the implied sense of the field line bending. The data are colour-coded red when the field (ignoring rapid fluctuations)\nis consistent with a \u2018lagging\u2019 configuration, green when it is \u2018leading\u2019, and black when the field is on average close to zero. The data are\ncolour-coded blue for magnetosheath\/magnetopause intervals. The blue dotted lines in the top two panels show the components of the ring\ncurrent field model derived by Connerney et al. (1983) (which again has zero azimuthal component). The model parameters are R1 = 8RS ,\nR2 = 15.5RS , D = 3RS , and \u00b5oIo \u2248 60.4 nT. The dotted lines in the panel showing the azimuthal magnetic field are calculated for the\nplasma sub-corotation effect using Eqs. (1)\u2013(5), with 6\u2217\nP\nequal to 1 mho (inner line) and 2 mho (outer line). The three lower panels give the\nposition of the spacecraft in cylindrical co-ordinates, showing the cylindrical radial distance from the planet\u2019s spin (and magnetic) axis \u03c1,\nthe distance along this axis from the equatorial plane z, and the local time (hours). The blue dotted line in the upper of these position panels\nshows the radial distance at which the field line passing through the spacecraft crosses the equatorial plane, determined from the SPV plus\nConnerney et al. (1983) ring current model employed here. The left-hand vertical dashed lines marked \u2018MP\u2019 show the positions of the first\nand last of five inbound magnetopause transitions, which occurred at spherical radial distances between 23 and 24RS . The central vertical\ndashed line marked \u2018CA\u2019 shows the closest approach of the spacecraft to the planet, at a spherical radial distance of 3.1RS .\nspacecraft (according to the SPV plus Connerney et al. ring\ncurrent model employed here). On the outbound pass reason-\nable agreement is found in the region of field lines mapping\nequatorially to \u223c15RS . The principal exceptions to these\nstatements occur when the spacecraft were passing through\nthe plasma sheet itself. Thus, for Voyager-1, a large \u2018lagging\u2019\nfield signature was observed throughout the closest approach,\nwhen the spacecraft was located south of the plasma sheet,\npeaking near the minimum cylindrical radial distance, with\nthe magnitude of the azimuthal field then gradually declin-\n1718 E.

By comparison, of\ncourse, the calculated field shows a sudden \u2018step\u2019 from one\nfield sense to the other as the spacecraft crossed the equa-\ntorial plane. The observed field is significantly weaker than\nthe calculated field in a region which is \u223c1RS wide (north-\nsouth), centred near (but northward of) the equatorial plane.\nIn a related manner, the Voyager-2 observations show the\npresence of \u2018lagging\u2019 fields essentially throughout the clos-\nest approach, with the azimuthal field reversing in sense as\nthe spacecraft passed through the plasma sheet near the clos-\nest approach. However, the magnitude of the observed and\ncalculated fields are smaller than for Voyager-1. In the calcu-\nlation this results principally from the differing modelled an-\ngular velocity profiles employed, with the Voyager-2 profile\nremaining closer to near-rigid corotation to larger distances,\nas observed in the Voyager plasma data (see Fig. 4a of the\ncompanion paper) and as shown in Fig. 2. Closer agreement\nbetween observed and modelled fields could undoubtedly be\nachieved by detailed adjustment of the angular velocity mod-\nels. However, such adjustment could not be justified in terms\nof a priori fitting to the rather scattered angular velocity data,\nand has not been attempted here.\nBeyond this region of reasonable agreement on the out-\nbound passes, the observed azimuthal fields then fall in\nmagnitude below those calculated to small (Voyager-2) or\nnear-zero values (Voyager-1), before subsequently increasing\nagain to larger magnitudes than those calculated, at (space-\ncraft) radial distances beyond \u223c20RS for Voyager-1 and\n\u223c15RS for Voyager-2. The extent of the contribution of the\nmagnetopause and tail currents to these fields will now be\ninvestigated.\nE. J.

As for Fig. 7, except for\nVoyager-2.\n4.3 Comparison of observed and calculated azimuthal\nfields for the magnetopause-tail currents\nWe now estimate the contribution to the observed azimuthal\nfield which is due to the magnetopause and tail current sys-\ntem, scaled from a model of the terrestrial magnetosphere,\nas outlined in Sect. 3. Results for Voyager-1 are shown in\nFig. 7, in essentially the same format as the upper panels of\nFig. 5, that is to say, the three panels of the plot show the\nresidual poloidal components (with SPV internal model sub-\ntracted) and the colour-coded azimuthal component in cylin-\ndrical co-ordinates, together with the scaled Earth field (blue\ndotted lines). In this case we have taken RMS = 23.5RS ,\nroughly half way between the first and last observed near-\nnoon inbound magnetopause crossing. The position and field\nscaling given by Eq. (6) are then rE \u2248 0.47 rS (where the\nposition vectors are in units of the corresponding planetary\nradii) and BS(rS) \u2248 \u22120.075BE(rE). We have also em-\nployed Dst \u2248 \u2212130 nT in the Earth model, which, with this\nfield scaling, thus becomes a near-planet axial perturbation\nfield of +9.5 nT at Saturn.\nIt can first be seen that, with the exception of the region\n1720 E. J. Bunce et al.: Azimuthal magnetic fields in Saturn\u2019s magnetosphere\nin the immediate vicinity of the closest approach, the scaled\nEarth model reproduces the poloidal components at Saturn\nreasonably well. The implication of this result is that the spa-\ntial distribution of the ring current within the magnetosphere,\nrelative to the magnetopause, is similar in the two cases. This\nis despite the fact that the physical mechanisms leading to\nthe existence of the ring currents are believed to be different\nin the two systems, involving solar wind-driven convection\nin the Earth\u2019s case, and rotation and radial diffusion at Sat-\nurn. As a by-product of this investigation, therefore, we note\nthat a future approach to three-dimensional field modelling\nat Saturn via modification of Earth models appears feasible.\nThe important point for this study, however, is the implica-\ntion that the structure of the modelled field captures the es-\nsential features of the poloidal field at Saturn. However, this\nis by no means true of the azimuthal components shown in\nthe lower panel. During the inbound pass, for example, the\nvalue of the modelled azimuthal field is negative, implying\na \u2018leading\u2019 field configuration in the post-noon sector as ex-\npected for the solar wind-related effect (Fig. 1). However, be-\ncause the spacecraft was located close to the noon meridian,\nas pointed out above, and also relatively close to the equato-\nrial plane, the magnitude of the modelled field is very small,\nremaining less than \u223c0.5 nT throughout the inbound inter-\nval. The modelled field thus does not explain even the rather\nweak \u2018leading\u2019 fields observed in the ring current region on\nthe inbound pass, with the implication that these are proba-\nbly due to an effect other than field bending associated with\nthe \u2018fringing\u2019 field of the magnetopause-tail current system.\nSimilarly, the results for the outbound pass indicate that the\nlatter current system makes essentially no contribution to the\n\u2018lagging\u2019 fields observed out to distances of\u223c15RS . Beyond\nthis distance, the modelled field increases to become an in-\ncreasing fraction of the observed field as the spacecraft nears\nthe \u2018tail\u2019 region (see also the good agreement with the radial\nfield component), until finally reaching agreement with the\nobserved field in the region adjacent to the outbound mag-\nnetopause (data not shown). We note that the position of\nthe outbound magnetopause agrees with the model values to\nwithin 10%.\nResults for Voyager-2 are shown in the same format in\nFig. 8. In this case we have taken RMS = 19RS , in agree-\nment with the position of the inbound magnetopause cross-\ning. We note that a major magnetospheric expansion took\nplace at some point during the flyby due to immersion in the\njovian magnetic tail (Behannon et al., 1983), but the time\nat which this occurred is unknown, and modelling the ex-\npanded state (with weaker azimuthal fields) has not been at-\ntempted here. With this value of RMS , then, the position\nand field scaling given by Eq. (6) are rE \u2248 0.58 rS and\nBS(rS) \u2248 \u22120.14BE(rE), respectively. We have also em-\nployed Dst \u2248 \u221250 nT in the Earth model, which thus be-\ncomes a near-planet axial perturbation field of +7 nT at Sat-\nurn. Again, it can be seen that the scaled Earth model repro-\nduces the poloidal components at Saturn quite well. How-\never, while the modelled azimuthal components are larger\nthan before, they are still not large enough to explain the\n\u2018leading\u2019 fields observed during the inbound pass, either in\nthe region next to the magnetopause, or in the region adja-\ncent to the ring current. The additional presence of other\ndynamical effects is thus again indicated, certainly in the lat-\nter case. On the outbound pass, the modelled fields are again\ntoo small to make a significant contribution out to radial dis-\ntances of \u223c10RS , but then become comparable to the ob-\nserved azimuthal field at distances beyond.\nOverall, these results suggest that the azimuthal magnetic\nfields which are due to the magnetopause-tail current system\nare not a significant effect during the dayside inbound passes,\nthough they would need to be included in any careful treat-\nment, as indicated by the Voyager-2 results. They also do\nnot contribute significantly within radial distances of \u223c10\u2013\n15RS on the dawn-side outbound passes, where the observed\nazimuthal fields are generally the largest. However, beyond\nsuch distances they gradually become the largest azimuthal\ncomponent as the spacecraft approaches and enters the re-\ngion dominated by the fields of the magnetospheric tail.\n5 Summary and discussion\nIn this paper we have for the first time quantitatively exam-\nined two mechanisms that will produce azimuthal magnetic\nfields in Saturn\u2019s magnetosphere, and have compared the cal-\nculated fields with those observed during the Saturn flybys\nof the two Voyager spacecraft. The first mechanism is as-\nsociated with the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling cur-\nrents that result from sub-corotation of the magnetospheric\nplasma, which produce \u2018lagging\u2019 fields at all local times as-\nsociated with the transfer of angular momentum from the at-\nmosphere to the plasma. The second is associated with the\nasymmetric confinement of the planetary field by the solar\nwind, i.e. the effect of the magnetopause and tail current\nsystem, which causes the field lines to be bent away from\nthe noon meridian on either side. Our calculation of the ex-\npected azimuthal field which is due to plasma sub-corotation\nis based on plasma angular velocity profiles observed during\nthe Voyager flybys, combined with a model of the magnetic\nfield, also derived from Voyager data, which is used to map\nthe angular velocities into the ionosphere. The effects of the\nmagnetopause and tail current system have been estimated\nempirically by scaling a data-based terrestrial field model to\nSaturn.\nA principal conclusion of the study is that the azimuthal\nfields observed in the inner part of the magnetosphere on\nboth flybys can be reasonably well accounted for by the\nmagnetosphere-ionosphere coupling mechanism, given an\neffective value of the ionospheric Pedersen conductivity\nof \u223c1\u20132 mho. The magnetopause-tail current system con-\ntributes only small fields within this region. Our conclusion\napplies specifically to the region of field lines mapping equa-\ntorially to distances within \u223c8RS of the planet on the day-\nside inbound passes, and to distances within \u223c15RS on the\ndawn side outbound passes. Voyager data indicate that the\nplasma distribution within \u223c8RS consists principally of a\nE. J. Bunce et al.: Azimuthal magnetic fields in Saturn\u2019s magnetosphere 1721\nthin equatorial heavy-ion plasma sheet lying within \u223c1RS\nof the equatorial plane, as shown in Fig. 4. We thus infer\nthat the main intervals during which reasonable agreement\nhas been found correspond to intervals when the spacecraft\nwere magnetically connected to, but lying outside of, this\nplasma sheet where the radial closure current flows, such that\nthey were then observing essentially the full azimuthal field\nof the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling currents. Our re-\nsults suggest that such conditions may extend to \u223c15RS on\nthe dawn side, beyond the region where dawn plasma data\nwere obtained. With the sub-corotation interpretation of the\nobserved azimuthal fields in the inner region, therefore, we\nthus infer an effective value of the Pedersen conductivity in\nthe conjugate ionosphere of \u223c1\u20132 mho.\nIn drawing this conclusion we should recognise the pos-\nsibility, however, that other magnetosphere-ionosphere cou-\npling currents could also contribute to the fields observed in\nthe inner region. For example, Connerney et al. (1983) mod-\nelled the principal azimuthal magnetic field signature ob-\nserved near the closest approach by Voyager-1 in terms of\na line current flowing into the nightside auroral zone at 80\u25e6\nsouthern latitude and 21:30 LT, and discussed its presence in\nterms of solar wind-magnetosphere coupling effects. This\nmodel of the current certainly has the virtue that it also pro-\nvides some explanation of the additional field perturbations\nthat can be seen near closest approach in the poloidal com-\nponents in Fig. 5, which are not accounted for in the axisym-\nmetric model derived here. The important point we wish to\nmake, however, is that to the extent that the observed fields\nare actually due to other causes, the contribution which is\ndue to sub-corotation of the plasma must be less, thus im-\nplying a smaller value of the effective ionospheric Pedersen\nconductivity. Given the degree to which our modelled fields\naccount in a simple way for the major features of the \u2018clos-\nest approach\u2019 data on both flybys, it seems likely to us that\nthe sub-corotation coupling currents play a significant role\nin this region, with a consequent inferred effective Pedersen\nconductivity of the order of \u223c1 mho. If we take the oppo-\nsite view, however, that the observed azimuthal fields in this\nregion are principally due to other physical causes, for ex-\nample, along the lines discussed by Connerney et al. (1983),\nthen we must instead infer that the effective value of the Ped-\nersen conductivity must be significantly less than such val-\nues, such that \u223c1\u20132 mho represents a robust upper limit. In\neither case, the results of this study show that values above\n\u223c2 mho, i.e. in the range 10\u2013100 mho, can definitely be ruled\nout.\nOutside of the inner region, the plasma in the dayside\nmagnetosphere is believed to be more distributed along the\nfield lines according to present models, such that the in-\nbound spacecraft were then presumably immersed within\nthe current-carrying magnetospheric plasma. Intervals of\nboth \u2018leading\u2019 and \u2018lagging\u2019 azimuthal fields were observed\nin this region during the inbound passes of both space-\ncraft. \u2018Leading\u2019 (or near-zero) fields were observed in a\nlayer \u223c5RS wide adjacent to the magnetopause, and within\n(or adjacent to) the ring current region at equatorial radial\ndistances between \u223c8 and \u223c15RS , with a region of \u2018lag-\nging\u2019 fields lying between. The magnitude of the lagging\nfields was again found to be consistent with those calculated\nfor sub-corotation of the plasma, with an effective value of\nthe ionospheric Pedersen conductivity of \u223c1\u20132 mho, though\ngiven the intermittent nature of these fields it seems unclear\nwhether or not this agreement is fortuitous. The magnitude\nof the observed \u2018leading\u2019 fields is found to be significantly\nlarger than those calculated from the scaled terrestrial model,\nindicating that additional dynamical processes are at work,\nperhaps related to the spin-periodic effect discussed by Es-\npinosa and Dougherty (2000). On the dawn side outbound\npasses, the observed azimuthal field fell below values calcu-\nlated for the sub-corotation mechanism on field lines map-\nping equatorially beyond \u223c15RS , before subsequently in-\ncreasing once more to \u2018lagging\u2019 values greater than those\ncalculated at radial distances beyond \u223c20RS . Our results\nindicate that the latter fields are simply those due to the tail\ncurrent system, as might reasonably be expected.\nOverall, our study has raised a number of issues concern-\ning the origins of azimuthal magnetic fields inside Saturn\u2019s\nmagnetosphere. Specifically, we have shown that azimuthal\nfields associated with sub-corotation of the plasma and angu-\nlar momentum transfer from the atmosphere to the magneto-\nsphere may play a substantial role, particularly in the inner\nregions located outside of, but mapping into, the thin equa-\ntorial heavy-ion plasma sheet. Our results indicate that the\nmagnetopause-tail current system leads to little field bend-\ning in this inner region. If we then assume that the major-\nity of the azimuthal field which is measured in this region\nis due to plasma sub-corotation, the implied value of the ef-\nfective Pedersen conductivity of Saturn\u2019s ionosphere is \u223c1\u2013\n2 mho. If, on the other hand, we assume that the azimuthal\nfield has substantial contributions from other sources, then\nthe latter values provide an upper limit. Outside of this inner\nregion, both \u2018lagging\u2019 and \u2018leading\u2019 fields were observed on\nthe dayside, but the \u2018leading\u2019 fields are generally too large to\nbe accounted for by the fringing fields of the magnetopause-\ntail current system, and may instead be principally related\nto the dynamical process producing the \u223c11 h periodicity in\nthe field data found by Espinosa and Dougherty (2000). We\nalso note the presence of small-scale features in the field data\nwhich may be associated with ultra low frequency (ULF)\nwaves. In the dawn and nightside magnetosphere, the field\nof the tail current system becomes significant at radial dis-\ntances beyond \u223c15\u201320RS . We finally note, as a by-product,\nthat the results of this study also indicate that modification\nand scaling of terrestrial field models may form a useful fu-\nture approach to three-dimensional magnetic field modelling\nat Saturn.\nAcknowledgements.
