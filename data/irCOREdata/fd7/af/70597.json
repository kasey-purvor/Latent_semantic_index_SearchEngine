Introduction\nThe chiral nature of quasiparticles in ultra-thin graphitic\nfilms [1\u20135] recently revealed in quantum Hall effect mea-\nsurements [6\u20139] originates from the honeycomb lattice\nstructure of a monolayer of graphite (graphene). Based on\nthe sublattice composition of electronic Bloch states and\nthe band structure, charge carriers in monolayer and bi-\nlayer graphene have been attributed Berry phases \u03c0 [1\u20134],\nand 2\u03c0 [5], respectively. On the basis of the Berry phase\nanalysis [4,10], disordered monolayer graphene can be ex-\npected to display typically weak anti-localization behavior\n[10,11] (similar to that in materials with strong spin-orbit\ncoupling [12]), in contrast to bilayer graphene where one\nwould na\u00a8\u0131vely assume the standard weak localization (WL)\neffect and negative magnetoresistance (MR) [13].\nHowever, the interference properties of graphene are\nstrongly affected [14,15] by subtle details of electronic\nband structure and are so sensitive to the symmetry of\ninternal disorder [14\u201317] that the na\u00a8\u0131ve expectations above\nare altered. In the absence of intervalley scattering, nei-\nther of these two materials would display any (negative or\npositive) WL MR. In high-density monolayers and bilayers\nof any density, this is due to trigonal warping of the band\nstructure [14,15,5]. In low-density monolayer graphene,\nthe same effect is caused by weak random-bond disorder\ndue to bending of a graphene sheet (ripples [16]) and by\ndislocation\/antidislocation pairs [18,17] which, from the\npoint of view of an electron propagating in a fixed valley\nstate, is equivalent to the effect of a random gauge field\nin the Dirac fermion problem [19]. The cumulative effect\nof all these factors can be described using the relaxation\nrate \u03c4\u22121\u2217 , which we introduce formally in Eqs. (9) and\n(18) in Sections 2 and 3, respectively. However, due to the\nactual time-inversion symmetry of graphene, intervalley\nscattering restores the WL effect, so that the tendency\nof electrons in an infinite graphene sheet is to localize\n[14,20\u201322]. As a result, for realistic structures with a finite\nintervalley scattering rate, \u03c4\u22121i \u226a \u03c4\u22121\u2217 , Eqs. (8,17), and\nlong enough phase-coherence time \u03c4\u03d5 > \u03c4i, it is natural to\ndisplay WL MR \u03b4\u03c1(B) saturated at a magnetic field scale\nB \u223c Bi = h\u00afc4De\u03c4\u22121i , where D is the diffusion coefficient.\nTypical magnetoresistance behavior of monolayer and\nbilayer graphene is sketched in Fig. 1(a) and (b). The two\ncurves in each plot illustrate two extremes: \u03c4\u22121\u2217 \u226a \u03c4\u22121i\nand \u03c4\u22121\u2217 \u226b \u03c4\u22121i . In the experimentally plausible situa-\ntion \u03c4\u22121\u2217 \u226b \u03c4\u22121i , the magnetoresistance in both mono-\nand bilayer material is typically of a WL type, with al-\nmost no sign of antilocalization up to the highest fields,\nwhich shows that, unlike in a ballistic regime [23] or a quan-\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier 27 February 2007\nr\n(\nB\n)\n \n-\n \nr\n(\n0\n)\n0\na )\nr\n(\nB\n)\n \n-\n \nr\n(\n0\n)\n0\nb )\nB i  B i  \n~\nB\n> > t i t *\nB *  B\nB\n> > t it *\n< < t  < < tit * j\n< < t  < < tit * j\nFig. 1.

In both cases, we assume that the phase coher-\nence time determines the longest relaxation time scale in the sys-\ntem. (b) Magnetoresistance of bilayer graphene, \u03c4\u2217 \u226a \u03c4i (solid line)\nand \u03c4\u2217 \u226b \u03c4i (dashed). Note that, for the case when \u03c4\u03d5 \u226a \u03c4i and\n\u03c4\u2217 \u226a \u03c4i,\u2206\u03c1(B) = 0 in both monolayer and bilayer graphene.\ntizing magnetic field [3,5], the chiral nature of quasiparti-\ncles does not manifest itself in the weak field magnetore-\nsistance of realistic disordered graphene. In a hypothetical\ncase of \u03c4\u22121\u2217 \u226a \u03c4\u22121i , \u03c4\u22121\u03d5 , the magnetoresistance of mono-\nlayer graphene \u03b4\u03c1(B) might change its sign at the field Bi\nsuch that \u03c4B \u223c \u03c4i: from negative at B < Bi to positive at\nhigher fields, whereas in bilayer graphene with \u03c4\u22121\u2217 \u226a \u03c4\u22121i\na longer negative WL MR tail is expected. In the regime of\n\u03c4\u22121\u03d5 > \u03c4\n\u22121\ni we do not expect graphene to display any weak\nlocalization effect at all: \u2206\u03c1 = 0.\nBelow we present a detailed analysis of the WL effect in\nmonolayers and bilayers in Sections 2 and 3, respectively. In\nSection 4 we describe the effect of edges onWL in graphene\nand show that graphene nanoribbons should display the\nusual WL behavior.\n2. Weak localization magnetoresistance in\ndisordered monolayer graphene\nThe hexagonal lattice of monolayer graphene contains\ntwo non-equivalent sites A and B in the unit cell, as shown\nin Fig. 2(a). The Fermi level in neutral graphene is pinned\nnear the corners K\u00b1 [24] of the hexagonal Brillouin zone,\nwhere the quasiparticle spectrum can be described by the\nHamiltonian [1,4,14,25],\nH\u02c61 = v\u03a0z (\u03c3xpx + \u03c3ypy) + h\u02c61w + V\u02c6dis, (1)\nh\u02c61w = \u00b5\u03a00\n[\n\u03c3y (pxpy + pypx)\u2212 \u03c3x\n(\np2x \u2212 p2y\n)]\n.\nThis Hamiltonian operates in the space of four-component\nwave functions, \u03a6 = [\u03c6K+(A), \u03c6K+(B), \u03c6K\u2212(B), \u03c6K\u2212(A)]\ndescribing electronic amplitudes on A and B sites and in\nthe valleysK\u00b1. Here, we use a direct product of AB lattice\nspace matrices \u03c30 \u2261 1\u02c6, \u03c3x,y,z and inter\/intra-valley matri-\nces \u03a00 \u2261 1\u02c6,\u03a0x,y,z to highlight the difference between the\nform of H\u02c61 in the non-equivalent valleys. The Hamiltonian\nH\u02c61 takes into account nearest neighbor A\/B hopping in\nthe plane with the first (second) term representing the first\n(second) order term in an expansion with respect to mo-\nmentum p measured from K+ and K\u2212.\nA\nB\nB B\nA\nA\np x\np y\nj\np\naa )\nK +K -\ne ( K - , p ) = e ( K - , - p ) e ( K + , p ) = e ( K + , - p )\ne ( K - , p ) = e ( K + , - p )\np\nb )\nFig. 2. (a)Schematic plan view of the monolayer lattice containing\ntwo sites in the unit cell, A (white circles) and B (grey), arranged\non an hexagonal lattice (solid lines). (b)Fermi lines (solid lines) in\nthe vicinity of two inequivalent valleys K+ and K\u2212 of the hexag-\nonal Brillouin zone (dashed line). Trigonal warping produces asym-\nmetry of the dispersion at each valley \u01eb(K\u00b1,p) 6= \u01eb(K\u00b1,\u2212p), where\nmomentum p is determined with respect to the center of the val-\nley, but the effects of warping in the valleys have opposite signs,\n\u01eb(K\u00b1,p) = \u01eb(K\u2213,\u2212p).\nNear the center of the valley K+, the Dirac-type part,\nv \u03c3 \u00b7 p, of H\u02c61 determines the linear dispersion \u01eb = vp for the\nelectron in the conduction band and \u01eb = \u2212vp for the valence\nband. Electrons in the conduction and valence bands also\ndiffer by the isospin projection onto the direction of their\nmomentum (chirality): \u03c3 \u00b7p\/p = 1 in the conduction band,\n\u03c3 \u00b7 p\/p = \u22121 in the valence band. In the valley K\u2212, the\nelectron chirality is mirror-reflected: it fixes \u03c3 \u00b7 p\/p = \u22121\nfor the conduction band and \u03c3 \u00b7 p\/p = 1 for the valence\nband. For an electron in the conduction band, the plane\nwave states are\n\u03a6K\u00b1,p =\neipr\/h\u00af\u221a\n2\n(\nei\u03d5\/2| \u2193\u3009K\u00b1,p \u00b1 e\u2212i\u03d5\/2| \u2191\u3009K\u00b1,p\n)\n, (2)\n\u03a6K\u00b1,\u2212p =\nie\u2212ipr\/h\u00af\u221a\n2\n(\nei\u03d5\/2| \u2193\u3009K\u00b1,\u2212p \u2213 e\u2212i\u03d5\/2| \u2191\u3009K\u00b1,\u2212p\n)\nHere | \u2191\u3009K+,p = [1, 0, 0, 0], | \u2193\u3009K+,p = [0, 1, 0, 0] and\n| \u2191\u3009K\u2212,p = [0, 0, 1, 0], | \u2191\u3009K\u2212,p = [0, 0, 0, 1], the fac-\ntors e\u00b1i\u03d5\/2 take into account the chirality, and p =\n(p cos\u03d5, p sin\u03d5).\nThe term h\u02c61w in Eq. (1) leads to a trigonal deformation\nof a single-connected Fermi line and p \u2192 \u2212p asymmetry\nof the electron dispersion inside each valley, as illustrated\nin Fig. 2(b): \u01eb(K\u00b1,p) 6= \u01eb(K\u00b1,\u2212p). However, due to time-\nreversal symmetry [26] trigonal warping has opposite signs\nin the two valleys and \u01eb(K\u00b1,p) = \u01eb(K\u2213,\u2212p).\nThe interplay between the two terms in H\u02c61 resulting in\nthe asymmetry of the electronic dispersion manifests itself\nin the WL behavior. The WL correction to conductivity\nin disordered conductors is a result of the constructive in-\nterference of electrons propagating around closed loops in\nopposite directions [13] as sketched in Fig. 3(b).\nWL is usually described [13] in terms of the particle-\nparticle correlation function, Cooperon. Following the ex-\nample of Cooperons for a spin 12 , we classify Cooperons as\nsinglets and triplets in terms of \u2018isospin\u2019 (AB lattice space)\nand \u2018pseudospin\u2019 (inter\/intra-valley) indices. In fact, with\nregards to the isospin (sublattice) composition of Cooper-\nons in a disordered monolayer, only singlet modes are rel-\n2\nevant. This is because a correlator describing two plane\nwaves, \u03a6K+,p and \u03a6K\u2212,\u2212p Eq. (2), propagating in opposite\ndirections along a ballistic segment of a closed trajectory\nas in Fig. 3(b) has the following form:\n\u03a6K,p\u03a6K\u2032,\u2212p \u223c | \u2191\u3009K,p| \u2193\u3009K\u2032,\u2212p \u2212 | \u2193\u3009K,p| \u2191\u3009K\u2032,\u2212p\n\u2212e\u2212i\u03d5| \u2191\u3009K,p| \u2191\u3009K\u2032,\u2212p + ei\u03d5| \u2193\u3009K,p| \u2193\u3009K\u2032,\u2212p.\nIt contains only sublattice-singlet terms (the first two\nterms) because triplet terms (the last two terms) disap-\npear after averaging over the direction of momentum,\np = (p cos\u03d5, p sin\u03d5), so that \u3008e\u00b1i\u03d5\u3009\u03d5 = 0. In fact, our\ndiagrammatic calculation [14] shows that the interference\ncorrection to the conductivity of graphene is determined\nby the interplay of four isospin singlet modes: one pseu-\ndospin singlet and three pseudospin triplets. Of these, two\nof the pseudospin triplet modes are intravalley Cooperons\nwhile the remaining triplet and the singlet are intervalley\nCooperons.\nIn the WL picture for a diffusive electron in a metal,\ntwo phases \u03d11 and \u03d12 acquired while propagating along\npaths \u201c1\u201d and \u201c2\u201d [see Fig. 3(b)] are exactly equal, so that\nthe interference of such paths is constructive and, as a re-\nsult, enhances backscattering leading to WL [13]. In mono-\nlayer graphene the Berry phase \u03c0 characteristic for quasi-\nparticles described by the first term of H\u02c61, determines the\nphase difference \u03b4 \u2261 \u03d11 \u2212 \u03d12 = \u03c0N (where N is the wind-\ning number of a trajectory) [10,14], and one would expect\nweak anti-localization behavior. However, the asymmetry\nof the electron dispersion due to h\u02c61w, leading to warping\nof the Fermi line around each valley as in Fig. 2, deviates\n\u03b4 from \u03c0N . Indeed, any closed trajectory is a combina-\ntion of ballistic intervals, Fig. 3(b). Each interval, charac-\nterized by the momenta \u00b1pj (for the two directions) and\nby its duration tj , contributes to the phase difference \u03b4j =\n[\u01eb(pj)\u2212 \u01eb(\u2212pj)]tj = h\u02c61w(pj)tj . Since \u03b4j are random uncor-\nrelated, the mean square of \u03b4 =\n\u2211\n\u03b4j can be estimated as\n\u3008\u03b42\u3009 \u223c \u3008(tj h\u02c61w(pj))2\u3009t\/\u03c4tr, where t is the duration of the\npath and \u03c4tr is the transport mean free time [27].\nWarping thus determines the relaxation rate,\n\u03c4\u22121w \u2248 \u03c40\u3008Trh\u02c621w(p)\u3009\u03d5\/(2h\u00af2) \u2248 2\u03c40\n(\n\u01eb2\u00b5\/h\u00afv2\n)2\n, (3)\nwhich suppresses intravalley Cooperons, and, thus, weak\nanti-localization in the case when electrons seldom change\ntheir valley state. The two intervalley Cooperons are not\naffected by trigonal warping due to time-reversal symme-\ntry of the system which requires \u01eb(K\u00b1,p) = \u01eb(K\u2213,\u2212p),\nFig. 2. These two Cooperons cancel each other in the case\nof weak intervalley scattering, thus giving \u03b4g \u223c 0. How-\never, intervalley scattering, with rate \u03c4\u22121i larger than the\ndecoherence rate \u03c4\u22121\u03d5 , breaks their exact cancellation and\npartially restores weak localization.\nTo describe the valley symmetry of monolayer graphene\nand parameterize all possible types of disorder, we intro-\nduce two sets of 4\u00d74 Hermitian matrices the \u2018isospin\u2019 ma-\ntrices ~\u03a3 = (\u03a3x,\u03a3y,\u03a3z) with [\u03a3s1 ,\u03a3s2 ] = 2i\u03b5\ns1s2s3\u03a3s3 , and\nf = 0\nf\n( a ) ( b )\n( c )\np j\n- p jf = 0\nf\nFig. 3.

It demonstrates the fact that the chiral states Eq.

(5)\nThe operators ~\u03a3 and ~\u039b form two mutually independent al-\ngebras equivalent to the algebra of Pauli matrices (in Eqs.\n(4,5) \u03b5s1s2s3 is the antisymmetric tensor and [\u03a3s,\u039bl] = 0)\nthus they determine two commuting subgroups of the group\nU4 of unitary transformations [28] of a 4-component \u03a6:\nan \u2018isospin\u2019 sublattice group SU\u03a32 \u2261 {eia~n\u00b7~\u03a3} and a \u2018pseu-\ndospin\u2019 valley group SU\u039b2 \u2261 {eib~n\u00b7~\u039b}. Also, ~\u03a3 and ~\u039b change\nsign under the inversion of time, whereas products \u03a3s\u039bl are\nt\u2192 \u2212t invariant [26] and can be used as a basis for a quanti-\ntative phenomenological description of non-magnetic static\ndisorder [29,30].\nThe operators ~\u03a3 and ~\u039b help us to represent the electron\nHamiltonian in weakly disordered graphene as\nH\u02c61 = v ~\u03a3p+ h\u02c61w + I\u02c6u(r) +\n\u2211\ns,l=x,y,x\n\u03a3s\u039blus,l(r), (6)\nwhere h\u02c61w = \u2212\u00b5\u03a3x( ~\u03a3p)\u039bz\u03a3x( ~\u03a3p)\u03a3x.\nThe Dirac-type part v ~\u03a3p of H\u02c61 in Eq.(6) and potential dis-\norder I\u02c6u(r) (where I\u02c6 is a 4\u00d74 unit matrix and \u3008u (r)u (r\u2032)\u3009 =\nu2\u03b4 (r\u2212 r\u2032)) do not contain valley operators \u039bl, thus, they\nremain invariant with respect to the pseudospin transfor-\nmations from valley group SU\u039b2 . If disorder due to charges\nlying in a substrate at distances from the graphene sheet\nshorter or comparable to the electron wavelength h\/pF\ndominates the elastic scattering rate, then \u03c4\u22121 \u2248 \u03c4\u221210 =\n\u03c0\u03b3u2\/h\u00af, where \u03b3 = pF\/(2\u03c0h\u00af\n2v) is the density of states of\nquasiparticles per spin in one valley.\nAll other types of disorder, which break the SU\u039b2 pseu-\ndospin symmetry of the system, are included in a random\nmatrix \u03a3s\u039blus,l(r). In particular, uz,z(r) describes differ-\n3\nent on-site energies on the A and B sublattices, caused by\natomically sharp defects. Terms with ux(y),z(r) play the\nrole of a valley-antisymmetric vector potential. Such dis-\norder [19] naturally appears in honeycomb lattice models\nwith random bonds [30], which can be used to model ran-\ndomly bent graphene sheets [16] and graphene with a finite\nconcentration of dislocation\/antidislocation pairs [18,17].\nTerms with us,x(y)(r) take into account inter-valley scatter-\ning. For simplicity, we assume that different types of disor-\nder are uncorrelated, \u3008us,l(r)us\u2032,l\u2032(r\u2032)\u3009 = u2sl\u03b4ss\u2032\u03b4ll\u2032\u03b4(r\u2212r\u2032)\nand, on average, isotropic in the x \u2212 y plane, u2xl = u2yl \u2261\nu2\u22a5l, u\n2\nsx = u\n2\nsy \u2261 u2s\u22a5. We parameterize them by scatter-\ning rates \u03c4\u22121sl = \u03c0\u03b3u\n2\nsl\/h\u00af. Also, the warping term, h\u02c61w lifts\nthe pseudospin symmetry SU\u039b2 , though it remains invariant\nunder pseudospin rotations around the z-axis.\nIn the formal WL analysis, we use a Cooperon matrix\nC\u03be\u00b5\u03be\n\u2032\u00b5\u2032\n\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u2032\u03b2\u2032 where subscripts describe the isospin state of in-\ncoming \u03b1\u03b2 and outgoing \u03b1\u2032\u03b2\u2032 pairs of electrons and super-\nscripts describe the pseudospin state of incoming \u03be\u00b5 and\noutgoing \u03be\u2032\u00b5\u2032 pairs. We classify Cooperons as singlets and\ntriplets in terms of isospin and pseudospin indices CM1M2S1S2 .\nFor example, M = 0 is a \u2018pseudospin-singlet\u2019, M = x, y, z\nare three \u2018pseudospin-triplet\u2019 components; S = 0 is an\n\u2018isospin-singlet\u2019 and S = x, y, z are \u2018isospin-triplet\u2019 compo-\nnents [31].\nIt turns out [14] that the WL correction to the conduc-\ntivity in terms of Cooperons reads [32]\n\u03b4g =\n2e2D\n\u03c0h\u00af\n\u222b\nd2q\n(2\u03c0)\n2\n(\nCx0 + C\ny\n0 + C\nz\n0 \u2212 C00\n)\n. (7)\nThe last term in Eq. (7), C00 is the only true gapless mode\nwhich determines the dominance of the WL sign in the\nquantum correction to the conductivity in graphene with a\nlong phase coherence time, \u03c4\u03d5 > \u03c4i. Amongst the rest, the\nintervalley component Cz0 has a gap 2\u03c4\n\u22121\ni determined by\nthe intervalley scattering rate,\n\u03c4\u22121i = 4\u03c4\n\u22121\n\u22a5\u22a5 + 2\u03c4\n\u22121\nz\u22a5 , (8)\ntwo intravalley components Cx0 , C\ny\n0 have gaps \u03c4\n\u22121\n\u2217 deter-\nmined by cumulative inter\/intra valley scattering rates\nwhich also include the trigonal warping effect,\n\u03c4\u22121\u2217 \u2261 \u03c4\u22121w + 2\u03c4\u22121z + \u03c4\u22121i , where \u03c4\u22121z = 2\u03c4\u22121\u22a5z + \u03c4\u22121zz . (9)\nHere we use the x \u2212 y plane isotropy of disorder, \u03c4\u22121sx =\n\u03c4\u22121sy \u2261 \u03c4\u22121s\u22a5 and \u03c4\u22121xl = \u03c4\u22121yl \u2261 \u03c4\u22121\u22a5l .\nUsing expression Eq. (7), we find the B = 0 temperature\ndependent correction, \u03b4\u03c1\/\u03c1 = \u2212\u03b4g\/g, to the graphene sheet\nresistance. Taking into account the double spin degeneracy\nof carriers we present\n\u03b4\u03c1 (0)\n\u03c12\n=\ne2\n\u03c0h\nln(1 + 2\n\u03c4\u03d5\n\u03c4i\n) + \u03b40, (10)\nand evaluate magnetoresistance, \u03c1(B)\u2212 \u03c1(0) \u2261 \u2206\u03c1(B),\n\u2206\u03c1(B) = \u2212e\n2\u03c12\n\u03c0h\n[\nF (\nB\nB\u03d5\n)\u2212 F ( B\nB\u03d5 + 2Bi\n)\n]\n+ \u03b4(B), (11)\nF (z) = ln z + \u03c8(\n1\n2\n+\n1\nz\n), B\u03d5,i,\u2217 =\nh\u00afc\n4De\n\u03c4\u22121\u03d5,i,\u2217 .\nThe latter result is sketched in Fig. 1. Here, \u03c8 is the\ndigamma function and the decoherence (taken into ac-\ncount by the rate \u03c4\u22121\u03d5 ) determines the curvature of the\nmagnetoresistance at B < B\u03d5 \u2261 h\u00afc\/4De\u03c4\u03d5. The small\ncorrections \u03b40 = \u2212[2e2\/(\u03c0h)] ln \u03c4\u03d5\/\u03c4tr1+\u03c4\u03d5\/\u03c4\u2217 and \u03b4(B) =\n[2e2\u03c12\/(\u03c0h)]F ( BB\u03d5+B\u2217 ) originate from two intravalley\nCooperons strongly suppressed by the trigonal warping\neffect and intravalley scattering. For B\u2217 \u226b Bi, the MR\n\u2206\u03c1(B) is distinctly of a WL type, with almost no sign of\nantilocalization. Such behavior is expected in graphene\ntightly coupled to an insulating substrate (which generates\natomically sharp scatterers). In a sheet loosely attached to\na substrate (or suspended), the intervalley scattering time\nmay be longer than the decoherence time, \u03c4i > \u03c4\u03d5 > \u03c4w\n(Bi < B\u03d5 < B\u2217). In this case MR would display neither\nWL nor antilocalization behavior: \u2206\u03c1(B) = 0.\n3. Bilayer graphene\nBilayer graphene consists of two coupled monolayers. Its\nunit cell contains four inequivalent sites, A,B, A\u02dc and B\u02dc\n(A,B and A\u02dc, B\u02dc lie in the bottom and top layer, respec-\ntively) arranged according to Bernal stacking [33,5]: sites\nB of the honeycomb lattice in the bottom layer lie exactly\nbelow A\u02dc of the top layer. The Brillouin zone of the bi-\nlayer, similarly to the one in monolayer, has two inequiv-\nalent degeneracy points K+ and K\u2212 which determine two\nvalleys centered around \u01eb = 0 in the electron spectrum\n[24]. Near the center of each valley the electron spectrum\nconsists of four branches. Two branches describing states\non sublattices A\u02dc and B are split from energy \u01eb = 0 by\nabout\u00b1\u03b31, the interlayer coupling, whereas two low-energy\nbranches are formed by states based upon sublattices A\nand B\u02dc. The latter can be described [5] using a Hamiltonian\nwhich acts in the space of four-component wave functions\n\u03a6 = [\u03c6K+,A, \u03c6K+,B\u02dc, \u03c6K\u2212,B\u02dc , \u03c6K\u2212,A], where \u03c6\u03be,\u03b1 is an elec-\ntron amplitude on the sublattice \u03b1 = A, B\u02dc and in the valley\n\u03be = K+,K\u2212:\nH\u02c62L =\u2212 1\n2m\n[(\np2x \u2212 p2y\n)\n\u03c3x + 2pxpy\u03c3y\n]\n+ h\u02c62w + V\u02c6 , (12)\nh\u02c62w = v3\u03a0z (px\u03c3x \u2212 py\u03c3y) .\nHere, \u03c3x,y,z and \u03a0x,y,z are Pauli matrices acting in sublat-\ntice and valley space, respectively.\nThe first term in Eq. (12) is the leading contribution in\nthe nearest neighbors approximation of the tight-binding\nmodel [5]. This approximation takes into account both in-\ntralayer hopping A \u2194 B and A\u02dc \u2194 B\u02dc (that leads to the\nDirac-type dispersion \u01eb = \u00b1pv near the Fermi point K\u00b1\nin a monolayer) and the interlayer A\u02dc \u2194 B hopping. This\nterm yields the parabolic spectrum \u01eb = \u00b1p2\/2m with m =\n\u03b31\/2v\n2 which dominates in the intermediate energy range\n1\n4\u03b31(v3\/v)\n2 < \u03b5F <\n1\n4\u03b31. In this regime we can truncate the\n4\nexpansion of H\u02c6(p) in powers of the momentum p neglect-\ning terms of the order higher than quadratic.\nElectron waves characteristic for the first, quadratic,\nterm of H\u02c62L have the form\n\u03a6K,\u00b1p = \u00b1e\n\u00b1ipx\/h\u00af\n\u221a\n2\n(\ne\u2212i\u03d5| \u2191\u3009K,\u00b1p \u2212 ei\u03d5| \u2193\u3009K,\u00b1p\n)\n, (13)\nwhere | \u2191\u3009K+,\u00b1p = [1, 0, 0, 0], | \u2193\u3009K+,\u00b1p = [0, 1, 0, 0] and\n| \u2191\u3009K\u2212,\u00b1p = [0, 0, 1, 0], | \u2191\u3009K\u2212,\u00b1p = [0, 0, 0, 1]. These are\neigenstates of an operator \u03c3n2 with \u03c3n2 = \u22121 for electrons\nin the conduction band and \u03c3n2 = 1 for electrons in the\nvalence band, where n2(p) = (cos(2\u03d5), sin(2\u03d5)) for p =\n(pcos\u03d5, psin\u03d5), which means that they are chiral, but with\nthe degree of chirality different from the one found in the\nmonolayer (see Sec. 2).\nThe second term in Eq. (12), h\u02c62w, originates from a weak\ndirect A \u2194 B\u02dc interlayer coupling. It leads to a Lifshitz\ntransition in the shape of the Fermi line of the 2D electron\ngas which takes place when \u01ebF \u223c \u01ebL \u2261 14\u03b31(v3\/v)2 corre-\nsponding to density nL \u223c v23\u03b321\/(2\u03c0h\u00af2v4) \u223c 1011cm\u22122 (us-\ning v3\/v \u223c 0.1). In a bilayer with \u01ebF < \u01ebL, the interplay\nbetween the two terms in H\u02c62L determines the Fermi line in\nthe form of four pockets [5] in each valley. In a bilayer with\n\u01ebF > \u01ebL, h\u02c62w can be treated as a perturbation leading to a\ntrigonal deformation of a single-connected Fermi line, thus\nmanifesting the asymmetry of the electron dispersion in-\nside each valley: \u01eb(K\u00b1,p) 6= \u01eb(K\u00b1,\u2212p). This asymmetry\nleads to the dephasing effect of electron trajectories simi-\nlar to the one discussed in the case of the monolayer, and\nis characterized by the scattering rate\n\u03c4\u22121w \u2248\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\n1\n2h\u00af2\n\u03c4\u3008Trh\u02c622w(p)\u3009\u03d5 \u223c \u03c0nLl2\u03c4\u22121, \u03c0nLl2 < 1\n\u03c4\u22121, \u03c0nLl\n2 > 1\n. (14)\nWe estimate that for the recently studied bilayers [9] with\nne = 2.5\u00d7 1012cm\u22122, l \u223c 0.1\u00b5m and \u03c4w \u223c \u03c4 .\nThe term V\u02c6 in Eq. (12) describes time-reversal-\nsymmetric disorder. It is parameterized using t\u2192 \u2212t sym-\nmetric 4\u00d7 4 matrices acting in the sublattice\/valley space,\nV\u02c6 =\n\u2211\ns,l=0,x,y\n\u03a0l\u03c3susl(r) + \u03a0z\u03c3zuzz(r). (15)\nThe sum in Eq. (15) contains valley and isospin conserv-\ning disorder potential I\u02c6u(r), with \u3008u(r)u(r\u2032)\u3009 = u2\u03b4(r\u2212 r\u2032)\nand \u03c4\u221210 = \u03c0\u03b3u\n2\/h\u00af, \u03b3 = m2\u03c0 , which originates from charged\nimpurities in the SiO2 substrate and is assumed to be the\ndominant mechanism of scattering in the system. All other\ntypes of disorder which breaks valley and sublattice sym-\nmetries are assumed to be uncorrelated, \u3008us l(r)us\u2032 l\u2032(r\u2032)\u3009 =\nu2s l\u03b4ss\u2032\u03b4ll\u2032\u03b4(r \u2212 r\u2032). We characterize them using scattering\nrates \u03c4\u22121s l = \u03c0\u03b3u\n2\ns l\/h\u00af. Furthermore, the scattering is as-\nsumed to be isotropic in the x \u2212 y plane, so that u2xl =\nu2yl \u2261 u2\u22a5l, u2s x = u2sy \u2261 u2s\u22a5.\nTo analyze the WL effect we introduce a Cooperon ma-\ntrix C\u03be\u00b5\u03be\n\u2032\u00b5\u2032\n\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u2032\u03b2\u2032 where subscripts describe the sublattice state\nof incoming \u03b1\u03b2 and outgoing \u03b1\u2032\u03b2\u2032 pairs of electrons and su-\nperscripts describe the valley state of incoming \u03be\u00b5 and out-\ngoing \u03be\u2032\u00b5\u2032 pairs. With the bilayer Hamiltonian written in\nterms of \u03a0, \u03c3 matrices Eqs. (12), we parameterize Cooper-\nons as CM1M2S1S2 by M1,M2 \u2019valley\u2019 and S1, S2 \u2019sublattice\u2019\nsinglet and triplet states in a similar way to monolayer\nisospin and pseudospin states. The sublattice composition\nof Cooperons is determined by the correlator of plane waves\npropagating ballistically in opposite directions,\n\u03a6K,p\u03a6K\u2032,\u2212p\u223c| \u2191\u3009K,p| \u2193\u3009K\u2032,\u2212p+| \u2193\u3009K,p| \u2191\u3009K\u2032,\u2212p\n\u2212e2i\u03d5| \u2191\u3009K,p| \u2191\u3009K\u2032,\u2212p\u2212 e\u22122i\u03d5| \u2193\u3009K,p| \u2193\u3009K\u2032,\u2212p.\nAfter averaging over the momentum direction the\nterms corresponding to CMx,y \u221d (| \u2191\u3009K,p| \u2191\u3009K\u2032,\u2212p \u00b1\n| \u2193\u3009K,p| \u2193\u3009K\u2032,\u2212p) disappear, since p = (p cos\u03d5, p sin\u03d5) so\nthat \u3008e\u00b12i\u03d5\u3009\u03d5 = 0, whereas terms corresponding to the sub-\nlattice symmetric Cooperons, CMz \u221d (| \u2191\u3009K,p| \u2193\u3009K\u2032,\u2212p +\n| \u2193\u3009K,p| \u2191\u3009K\u2032,\u2212p) remain non-zero.\nThe interference correction to the conductivity in a bi-\nlayer can be expressed in terms of four components of\nC (r, r), the Cooperon taken at coinciding coordinates, cor-\nresponding to valley singlet and three valley triplets:\n\u03b4g =\n2e2D\n\u03c0h\u00af\n[\u2212Czz + C0z \u2212 Cxz \u2212 Cyz ] . (16)\nThe WL correction Eq. (16) is determined by the two in-\ntervalley Cooperon modes, the gapless valley-symmetric\nmode Czz and valley-asymmetric C\n0\nz with the gap 2\u03c4\n\u22121\ni de-\ntermined by intervalley scattering rate,\n\u03c4\u22121i = 4\u03c4\n\u22121\n\u22a5\u22a5 + 2\u03c4\n\u22121\nz\u22a5 . (17)\nIn the absence of the intervalley scattering, the contribu-\ntions of C0z and C\nz\nz are equal in magnitude, so that they\ncancel, which leads to suppressed WL MR. In the case of\nstrong intervalley scattering due to atomically sharp de-\nfects, \u03c4i \u226a \u03c4\u03d5, this exact cancellation is broken and WL is\npartially restored. For completeness, in Eq. (16) we have\nretained the intravalley Cooperons Cx,yz , though they have\nlarger gaps \u03c4\u22121\u2217 , and, thus, are strongly suppressed by by\ntrigonal warping intravalley and intervalley disorder,\n\u03c4\u22121\u2217 \u2261 \u03c4\u22121w + 2\u03c4\u22121z + \u03c4\u22121i , \u03c4\u22121z = 2\u03c4\u22121zz . (18)\nEquation (10) yields the zero field WL correction\nto the resistivity and the WL MR is described by\nEq. (11). Equation (11) gives a complete description of\nthe crossover between two characteristic regimes men-\ntioned at the beginning (see Fig. 1(b)) [32]. It also includes\nsmall contributions of the suppressed intravalley Cooper-\nons, \u03b40 = [2e\n2\/(\u03c0h)] ln(\u03c4\u03d5\u03c4\u2217\/[\u03c4(\u03c4\u2217 + \u03c4\u03d5)]) and \u03b4(B) =\n\u2212[2e2\u03c12\/(\u03c0h)]F [B\/(B\u03d5 + B\u2217)], where B\u2217 = h\u00afc\/(4De\u03c4\u2217).\nThis permits us to account for a possible difference between\nthe warping time \u03c4w and the transport time \u03c4 . According\nto Eq. (11) WLMR in bilayer graphene sheet disappears as\nsoon as \u03c4i exceeds \u03c4\u03d5, whereas in structures with \u03c4\u03d5 > \u03c4i,\nthe result Eq. (11) predicts the WL behavior, as observed\n5\nin [34]. Such WL MR is saturated at a magnetic field de-\ntermined by the intervalley scattering time, instead of the\ntransport time as in usual conductors, which provides the\npossibility to measure \u03c4i directly.\n4. Conclusions: the effect of edges in nanoribbons\nSpecifically in graphene, p\u2192 \u2212p asymmetry of the elec-\ntron dispersion (trigonal warping) in each of its valleys,\nweak disorder in bonds (due to ripples on a graphene sheet),\nand a finite concentration of dislocation\/antidislocation\npairs lead to unusual behavior of interference effects in elec-\ntronic transport. Without intervalley scattering, these ef-\nfects destroy the manifestation of chirality in the localiza-\ntion properties and the very WL effect itself. Intervalley\nscattering tends to restore weak localization. This behav-\nior is universal for monolayer and bilayer graphene, despite\nthe fact that electrons in these two materials have different\nchiralities and can be attributed different Berry phases: \u03c0\nin monolayer, 2\u03c0 in bilayer [3,5]. This suggests that a sup-\npressed weak localization magnetoresistance and its sensi-\ntivity to intervalley scattering are specific to all ultrathin\ngraphitic films independently of their morphology [35] and\nare determined by the lower (trigonal) symmetry group of\nthe wavevector K in the corner of the hexagonal Brillouin\nzone of a honeycomb crystal.\nThe influence of intervalley scattering on the WL behav-\nior determines a typically negative (WL) MR in graphene\nnanoribbons. Indeed, in a narrow ribbon of graphene,\nmonolayer or bilayer, with the transverse diffusion time\nL2\u22a5\/D \u226a \u03c4i, \u03c4\u2217, \u03c4\u03d5, the sample edges determine strong in-\ntervalley scattering rate [36]. Thus, when solving Cooperon\nequations in a wire, we estimate \u0393l0 \u223c \u03c02D\/L2\u22a5 for the\npseudospin triplet, whereas the singlet C00 remains gapless.\nThis yields negative MR persistent over the field range\nB < 2\u03c0B\u22a5, where B\u22a5 \u2261 h\u00afc\/eL2\u22a5:\n\u2206\u03c1wire (B)\n\u03c12\n=\n2e2L\u03d5\nh\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0 1\u221a\n1 + 13B\n2\/B\u03d5B\u22a5\n\u2212 1\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb . (19)\nThe results of Eqs. (10,11,16) and (19) give a complete\ndescription of the WL effect in graphene. They describe\nhow the WL magnetoresistance reflects the degree of valley\nsymmetry breaking in the systems and agree with the recent\nmeasurements [16,34].\nThis project has been funded by Lancaster-EPSRC Port-\nfolio Partnership grant EP\/C511743 and was completed\nduring the MPI PKS Seminar \u201dDynamics and Relaxation\nin Complex Quantum and Classical Systems and Nanos-\ntructures.\u201d\nReferences\n[1] D.
