On 7 November 2005 various ground based and\nspaced based instruments registered five wave packets with\nfrequencies in the Pc4 range. The most prominent of the five\nwave packets was observed in ground based magnetometer\ndata spanning almost all latitudes on the dayside magneto-\nsphere. The propagation from the dayside into the tail is de-\nduced from Poynting flux calculations of Cluster data and\nan onset time analysis of the ground based magnetometer\ndata. This suggests an upstream source. Backstreaming ions\nare identified to be the most probable source mechanism for\nthis event. Due to the fortunate configuration of the Cluster\nsatellites, the harmonic structure of the wave is analysed and\ncompared with cross-phase spectra from ground data. We\npresent evidence that the driving wave resonantly interacted\nwith geomagnetic field lines. The data suggests that reso-\nnant driving occurred at stations where the driving frequency\nwas harmonically related to the local fundamental frequency,\ncreating FLR-like signatures.\nKeywords. Magnetospheric physics (MHD waves and in-\nstabilities; Solar wind-magnetosphere interactions) \u2013 Space\nplasma physics (Waves and instabilities)\n1 Introduction\nIn the dayside magnetosphere, ultra-low frequency (ULF)\npulsations with spectral power in the Pc4 frequency range\nare abundant. The Pc4 interval ranges from 7 to 22 mHz (pe-\nriods between 45 and 150 s) and the \u201cPc\u201d reflects the fact that\nthese pulsations tend to be continuous. They also occur less\nabundantly on the nightside.\nNightside Pc4 pulsations seem to be linked to substantial\nsubstorm activity, usually occurring two to four hours after-\nwards (e.g. Nose\u00b4, 1998). Particle data suggests that these pul-\nCorrespondence to: L. Clausen\n(lbnc1@ion.le.ac.uk)\nsations are driven via a wave-particle interaction by freshly\ninjected hot ions. Since most events occur during overall\nquiet geomagnetic times, a small convective electric field\nmight also play a role. Through similar wave-particle in-\nteractions ions injected during substorms also drive Pc4 pul-\nsations with high azimuthal wave numbers predominantly in\nthe morning sector (Baddeley et al., 2002).\nOn the dayside, Pc4 pulsations are thought to originate\nfrom either Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities on the magne-\ntopause (Greenstadt et al., 1979) or wave-particle instabili-\nties in the Earth\u2019s upstream region (Troitskaya et al., 1971;\nLe et al., 2000). An analysis of the occurrence region and\npropagation of the wave packets later in this paper will point\ntowards the second mechanism, hence we can ignore the first\nmechanism in the context of this study.\nWhen the orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field\n(IMF) is roughly (anti-)parallel to the normal vector of the\nbow shock, ions can be reflected at the boundary and travel\nupstream. Here they resonantly interact with naturally occur-\nring waves, amplifying them (Barnes, 1970; Sentman et al.,\n1981). Since upstream the bow shock the solar wind is\nsupersonic, these waves are then convected with the solar\nwind flow into the magnetosphere. Numerical hybrid models\nhave been used to show that these fast\/magnetosonic waves\ncan then pass through the turbulent bow shock and magne-\ntosheath into the dayside magnetosphere, leaving their spec-\ntrum mainly unchanged (Krauss-Varban, 1994).\nHaving reached the magnetosphere, compressional Pc3-4\nwaves are detected by space based instruments (e.g. Chi and\nRussell, 1998) and on the ground by magnetometers. On the\nground they appear usually as large scale waves with low\nazimuthal wave numbers (Odera et al., 1991). Several em-\npirical relations have been derived to predict the upstream\ngenerated frequency from IMF conditions (e.g. Le and Rus-\nsell, 1996).\nGround based magnetometers show a peak in Pc4 activ-\nity at latitudes below 60\u25e6 (Samson and Rostoker, 1972).\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n186 L. Clausen et al.: Multi-instrument observations of a large scale Pc4 pulsation\nContinuous pulsations at latitudes above 60\u25e6 are generally\nobserved at lower frequencies between 2 and 7 mHz (periods\nbetween 150 and 600 s) and these are termed Pc5 pulsations\n(e.g. Samson et al., 1992). Due to the lengths of the field\nlines at these latitudes the Pc5 range is favoured and Pc4\nwould only be expected if the density along the field lines\nwas significantly lower than normal.\nHigh latitude Pc5 pulsations often have distinctive char-\nacteristics and they have are known as field line resonances\n(FLR). Dungey proposed that they are standing Alfve\u00b4n waves\non geomagnetic field lines, a concept that has been confirmed\nby a number of studies (e.g. Walker et al., 1979). Since Chen\nand Hasegawa (1974) and Southwood (1974) have shown\nthat energy from compressional wave modes can couple to\nAlfve\u00b4nic modes, it is commonly accepted that compressional\nwaves generated at either the Earth\u2019s bow shock or through\nsolar wind buffeting can couple to FLRs where the frequen-\ncies match. Since the requirements are only met by a small\nfraction of field lines, FLRs tend to be latitudinally localized.\nIn this paper we discuss a highly coherent Pc4 pulsation\nwith a m number around unity. It is a global phenomenon,\noccurring at both low and high latitudes, over 12 h of mag-\nnetic local time (MLT). We explore the possibility of it be-\ning a FLR and investigate its source using ground and space\nbased magnetometer data.\n2 Observations\nOn 7 November 2005 between 13:10 and 14:10 UT over\ntwo dozen ground based magnetometers around the world\nregistered five wave packets in the upper end of the Pc4\nrange. During this time, the magnetic foot prints of Cluster\n3 and 4 of the four Cluster satellites (Escoubet et al., 2001)\nwere, according to the Tsyganenko 96 (T96) model (Tsyga-\nnenko, 1995), conjunct with magnetometers belonging to the\nCARISMA array located in Canada. The CARISMA array\nspans magnetic latitudes from 60\u25e6 to 80\u25e6 and magnetic lon-\ngitudes from 270\u25e6 to 330\u25e6. For the time discussed here, this\ntranslated to MLTs between 04:00 and 09:00, i.e. on the dawn\nflank of the magnetosphere. At the same time and nearly\nsymmetric to the morning side stations, magnetometers be-\nlonging to the SAMNET and IMAGE arrays on the evening\nside between 14:00 and 17:00 MLT registered the same os-\ncillations. These stations span magnetic latitudes from 50\u25e6\nto 75\u25e6 at magnetic longitudes between 70\u25e6 and 120\u25e6.\n2.1 Ground based magnetometers\nFigure 1 shows the X (North-South) component of the mag-\nnetic field as measured by magnetometers along three lati-\ntude profiles at different MLTs in the left panels. The data\nhave been bandpass filtered between 20 and 80 s. The mag-\nnetic latitude of each station and its MLT is given next to its\nabbreviation in the top left hand corner of each panel. The\nright hand side panels show the Fourier spectrum of the fil-\ntered time series, each individually normalized. The spectra\nhave been smoothed using a five points wide boxcar average\nto eliminate spikes.\nAs indicated in Fig. 1 by vertical dashed lines, five sepa-\nrate ULF wave packets can be identified at all stations. The\nfirst between 13:12 and 13:21 UT, the second between 13:23\nand 13:27 UT, the third between 13:30 and 13:42 UT, the\nfourth between 13:43 and 13:48 UT and the fifth between\n13:48 and 13:53 UT. The focus of this study lies on the wave\npacket which occurred between 13:30 and 13:42 UT. It was\nthe most prominent of the five, already well defined in unfil-\ntered data.\nBasic Fourier analysis of the interval between 13:10 and\n14:10 UT shows that the frequency of the first four pul-\nsations was 17.2\u00b11.0 mHz whereas the last oscillated at\n20.2\u00b11.0 mHz (see right panels in Fig. 1). The power at\n20.2 mHz dominates the power spectra of the northern IM-\nAGE stations SOD, IVA, KEV, whereas in all other spectra\nthe 17.2 mHz peak is dominant. The frequency of each wave\npacket was constant over all latitudes. Although not imme-\ndiately apparent from Fig. 1, cross-correlation techniques re-\nveal that all five packets can in fact be seen in the data of\nall stations. The bandwidth of the filter in Fig. 1 was chosen\nsuch that any power at double the dominant frequency, i.e.\nat 34 mHz, is not filtered. There was, however, no signature\npresent at this frequency.\nThe top six panels of Fig. 1 show the data of a line of\nmagnetometers belonging to the CARISMA array in Canada\nspanning about 20\u25e6 in magnetic latitude, located around\n07:00 MLT. The amplitude distribution of the third wave\npacket over latitude has two maxima, at ISLL and FCHU.\nBoth phase and onset time vary with latitude, however the\nfrequency does not. There is a distinct 180\u25e6 phase shift be-\ntween the time series of GILL and FCHU but only a very\nsmall shift across the latitude of ISLL. Therefore the ampli-\ntude and phase profile over FCHU are indicative for the fact\nthat the observed pulsation is at these stations is a FLR.\nWhen studied in detail the pulsation between 13:30 and\n13:42 UT consisted of two overlapping yet separate wave\npackets. SAMNET and IMAGE data (bottom panels in\nFig. 1) show this more clearly than data from CARISMA\nstations. The further north the station, the further apart the\ntwo wave packets appeared. Since the pulsation occurred si-\nmultaneously at all stations, this indicates that it was a spatial\nfeature rather than a temporal one.\nThe next seven panels in Fig. 1 show data from a latitude\nprofile of magnetometer stations belonging to the SAMNET\nchain. The profile is located along 78\u25e6 magnetic longitude\n(14:30 MLT). A wave packet with the same frequency was\nobserved between 13:30 and 13:42 UT, albeit with a smaller\namplitude. Studying latitude profiles of spectral power for\nthese stations at the observed frequency show two maxima\nin amplitude, one at HLL and the other at ESK. When only\nAnn.

A summary is given\nin Table 1. The m number is then obtained by dividing the\nobserved phase shift by the longitudinal separation. By con-\nvention the eastward direction is associated with positive m\nnumbers.\nWith increasing longitude the phase increases on the\nmorning side, corresponding to a negative m number and\nwestward propagation. On the evening side, the phase de-\ncreases with increasing longitude resulting in a positive m\nnumber, equivalent to eastward propagation. This corre-\nsponds in both cases to a propagation of the wave in an\nanti-sunward direction. The absolute value is in both cases\naround one, confirming that this wave was a large-scale phe-\nnomenon.\nAlthough it is not shown, it is worth noting that pulsa-\ntion signatures identical to those described above were ob-\nserved on the dayside by magnetometers located on Green-\nland, South America and Antarctica. These wave packets\nwere clearly a global magnetospheric phenomenon with the\nexact same frequency at all stations. From these additional\nsources only the Antarctic stations yielded enough power for\nanalysis, however due to the low power construction of these\nmagnetometers, the time stamp associated with each mea-\nsurement is uncertain by up to two minutes, thus rendering\nthese data useless for timing analysis.\nWeak but coherent signals of the pulsation described here\nwere also recorded at stations located on the nightside. Data\nfrom Japanese magnetometers at magnetic latitudes between\n20\u25e6and 40\u25e6and 23:00 MLT show pulsations at 17.2 mHz\nwith amplitudes around 0.2 nT. Magnetometers in Alaska\n(60\u25e6magnetic latitude, 03:00 MLT) recorded the pulsation\nwith an amplitude of 1 nT.\nFig. 2.

Cluster 2 was leading, followed\nby Cluster 1, 3 and 4, each separated by about 2 Re. Their or-\nbit took them from the southern hemisphere through perigee\nat about 5 Re over the northern hemisphere to apogee into the\ntail. Due to this orbit configuration, Cluster 3 and 4 sampled\nthe magnetic and electric field variations along essentially\nthe same bundle of field lines (see Fig. 2). At the time of\nthe wave event Cluster 1 and 2 had already passed the inner\nmagnetosphere and were on open field lines connected to the\nnorthern polar cap. Hence only Cluster 3 and 4 data can be\nused in this study.\nThe magnetic field was measured by the FGM (Balogh\net al., 2001) instrument on board the Cluster satellites. It\nis available in GSE coordinates at spin resolution (4 s). The\nelectric field data used in this study was gathered by the EFW\n(Gustafsson et al., 1997) instrument. They were provided by\nthe Cluster Active Archive and consist of two components in\nthe GSE X-Y plane, also at spin resolution. The third com-\nponent was calculated under the frozen flux assumption, i.e.\nE+v\u00d7B=0. It then follows that the electric and magnetic\nfield ought to be orthogonal, i.e. E \u00b7 B=0 which yields\nEz = \u2212(ExBx + EyBy)\/Bz. (1)\nThe results of the above calculation have to be treated very\ncarefully whenever Bz is close to zero. However, dur-\ning this event the Cluster satellites were deep inside the\nmagnetosphere close to the equatorial plane such that Bz was\nAnn.

(1), all compo-\nnents have been bandpass filtered to allow periods between\n20 and 80 s and then transformed into a local dipole aligned\ncoordinate system (LDC).\nIn this orthogonal system the background magnetic field\nis assumed to be purely dipolar. This assumptions is justi-\nfied by the geocentric distance of the satellites of only 5 Re.\nOne axis points along the background dipole magnetic field,\nsuch that positive values denote variations parallel to the lo-\ncal dipole field. The second axis points azimuthally, parallel\nto the X-Y GSM plane, positive eastward. The third axis\ncompletes the right hand system by pointing positive radi-\nally inwards. Thus, for magnetic field data the field aligned\ntime series will contain the compressional component, the\nazimuthal direction will contain transverse toroidal oscilla-\ntions and the radial component will contain the transverse\npoloidal oscillations.\nThe right panels in Fig. 3 show the Fourier spectra for the\nfiltered time series. The spectral powers have been smoothed\nusing a five point wide boxcar average to eliminate spikes.\nThen the spectra were normalized by the maximum value of\neach component for each quantity individually. Please note\nthat the range of the y axis is not the same for all spectra.\nThe left panels show time series of the magnetic and elec-\ntric field and the oscillatory Poynting flux. All quantities are\nplotted versus time, L-value, MLT and magnetic latitude of\nthe spacecraft. The dipole tilt angle respective to the Z-GSM\naxis during the event was about \u22129\u25e6.\nThe top three left panels in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 show the fil-\ntered components of the magnetic field for Cluster 3 and 4 in\nthe LDC, respectively. All five wave packets are clearly vis-\nible in the data and the polarization of the wave is revealed.\nThe variation at 17.2 and 20.2 mHz was confined to the field\naligned and azimuthal direction, showing that the wave con-\nsisted of a superposition of a transverse toroidal and a com-\npressional mode. This is true for data from both Cluster 3\nand 4.\nThe Fourier spectra show that the compressional and\npoloidal component of Cluster 3 magnetic field as well as\nthe toroidal electric field contained a weak signal at double\nthe main frequency, i.e. at 34 mHz. The same is true for the\nCluster 4 data.\nThe envelopes of the main pulsation seen by the FGM on\nboard Cluster 3 and 4 in the field aligned components show\nunder close inspection two maxima, whereas the azimuthal\ncomponents show only one.\nThe amplitude of the pulsation as seen by Cluster 3 was\nabout twice that seen by Cluster 4. Whereas the signal in the\nfield aligned direction had no phase shift between the two\nspacecraft the oscillation in the azimuthal direction was 180\u25e6\nout of phase.\nThe electric field shown in panels four to six in Fig. 3 and 4\nalso shows a clear polarization in the local dipole coordinate\nsystem. The bulk of the power was concentrated in the ra-\ndial direction with all five wave packets clearly visible. The\nazimuthal component shows an elevated level of what seems\nto be incoherent noise. There was a coherent oscillation at\n17.2 mHz in the field aligned direction. The ratio of radial to\nfield aligned amplitude was about ten at Cluster 3 and four at\nCluster 4, making the field aligned component more signifi-\ncant at Cluster 4. The signals from both satellites in the radial\ndirection were in phase, as were the field aligned. A consid-\nerable difference in the packet\u2019s envelope was observed.\nFrom the three components of the electric field e and the\nmagnetic field b the three components of the Poynting vector\ns have been calculated via\ns = 1\n\u00b50\n(e \u00d7 b). (2)\nSince s was calculated from the filtered components it repre-\nsents the Poynting flux of the wave field only.\nDue to the polarization of e and b in the LDC the Poynting\nvector was polarized as well, having comparable amplitudes\nin the field aligned and azimuthal component (see Fig. 3 and\nFig. 4 bottom three panels). The period of the oscillation was,\nas expected, double that of e and b. The field aligned com-\nponent of s for Cluster 3 showed a slight asymmetry around\nthe zero line, indicating more flux parallel to the background\nmagnetic field than anti-parallel. Since Cluster 3 was lo-\ncated about 12\u25e6 above the magnetic equator, this indicates\nthat some of the wave\u2019s energy was lost in the northern po-\nlar ionosphere. The same is true for observations at Cluster\n4 position, however here the energy was lost in the negative\nfield aligned direction into the southern hemisphere, in accor-\ndance with the satellites position at \u221210\u25e6 magnetic latitude.\nThe azimuthal flux at both satellites was, considering their\nposition in the magnetosphere, purely tailward, i.e. west-\nward, negative azimuthally. The asymmetries in both the\nfield aligned\/azimuthal flux is a direct and sole result of phase\nshift between the azimuthal\/field aligned magnetic and radial\nelectric field components at both satellites.\nThe small signals in the field aligned direction of the elec-\ntric field results in some flux in a radially inward direction,\nmore so at Cluster 4.\n3 Discussion\n3.1 Wave motion and origin\nThe observed pulsations were clearly a global phenomenon\nsince they were observed by ground based magnetometers in\ndifferent hemispheres spanning 12 hours of MLT. It is thus\nof special interest to discuss the structure and frequency of\nthe wave in order to assess where it was generated and what\nthe source mechanism was.

The right hand side panels show the respective smoothed Fourier spectra.\nCluster tetrahedron gives us the unique opportunity to study\nthe structure of the wave along a bundle of field lines and\nthus explore the wave\u2019s harmonic mode.\nAs discussed earlier, the magnetic field and Poynting flux\ndata suggests that the wave was composed of two modes,\nAlfve\u00b4nic and compressional. While the Alfve\u00b4nic flux oscil-\nlated along the background magnetic field between the two\nhemispheres depositing energy preferentially in the closer\npolar ionosphere, the flux of the compressional component\n(magnetic oscillation field aligned, electric oscillation radial)\nAnn.

Summary of field data from Cluster 4, same layout as Fig. 3.\nwas also highly asymmetric. Virtually all flux was directed\ntailward. This leads to the assumption of an anti-sunward\ntravelling compressional wave from which energy was lo-\ncally converted into the Alfve\u00b4nic mode. The pulsations seen\nby the ground based magnetometers are then due to these\nAlfve\u00b4nic oscillations.\nSince the speed of the proposed compressional disturbance\nis finite, the onsets of the pulsations in the ground based mea-\nsurements are dependent on this speed and on the position of\nthe point where the adjacent field line of each station crosses\nthe X-Y GSM plane. For convenience, this point will be\ncalled the cross-point in the following.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/26\/185\/2008\/ Ann. Geophys., 26, 185\u2013199, 2008\n192 L. Clausen et al.: Multi-instrument observations of a large scale Pc4 pulsation\nFig. 5. Equatorial crossing points of field lines adjacent to ground\nmagnetometer stations in GSM coordinates. The magnetopause po-\nsition was calculated according to Shue et al. (1997). The plasma-\npause is shown following Larsen et al. (2007).\nThe geographic positions of each magnetometer belonging\nto the CARISMA, IMAGE and SAMNET chain have been\ntraced along the adjacent field line into the equatorial plane\nof the GSM coordinate system (see Fig. 5), thus finding each\nstation\u2019s cross-point. The tracing utilised the T96 model with\ninput parameters derived from measurements of the GEO-\nTAIL satellite (pdyn=1.5 nPa, Dst=\u221215.0, By,IMF=\u22121.5\nnT, Bz,IMF=\u22120.5 nT). Due to the finite step size of the T96\nmodel, the Z values of the equatorial positions were not zero,\nhowever they were less than 0.2 Re for all stations.\nTo determine the onset time of at each station, the filtered\ntime series between 13:30 and 13:42 UT of each station of\nthe three chains have been cross-correlated with the time se-\nries of one reference station. HAD from the SAMNET chain\nwas chosen to be the reference since it is the station in which\ntime series the pulsation occurred first.\nThe sample interval of IMAGE stations is ten seconds as\nopposed to one second for SAMNET stations, therefore be-\nfore cross-correlation the reference data have been downsam-\npled by calculating the average over ten seconds. The same\nprocedure was applied before cross-correlating the reference\ndata with the four second sampled Cluster magnetic field\nmeasurements. Finally the onset time was then determined\nby extracting the lag of the maximum cross-correlation.\nTamao (1964) investigated the propagation of a MHD\nwave from a point source through a cold uniform plasma.\nFig. 6. MHD wave propagation inside the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere\nfrom a source Q to an observer P1, P2, P3, P4 on the ground. The\npath shown is that identified by Tamao (1964) as the least attenuated\none.\nHe then applied his findings qualitatively to a MHD wave\npropagating through the magnetosphere to an observer on the\nground.\nThe source Q emits compressional waves in all directions,\nas indicated by the dotted concentric lines in Fig. 6. These\nwaves travel with the local Alfve\u00b4n speed as the plasma is as-\nsumed to be cold, and they are attenuated as r\u22121, r being the\ndistance from the source. Along its path the fast mode con-\nstantly converts to the Alfve\u00b4n mode, which then travels along\nthe magnetic field line without further attenuation to P1, P2,\nP3, P4, the observer on the ground. Hence most power is\ntransported to the ground by a path which minimised the\nlength the wave travels in fast mode. This path is depicted\nin Fig. 6 as a straight arrow in blue from the source to the\nfield line connected to P1, P2, P3, P4, followed by the red\narrow indicating the Alfve\u00b4n mode travelling along the mag-\nnetic field line. This method was successfully used by Chi\net al. (2001) to explain arrival times of preliminary reverse\nimpulses.\nAdditional to the lag time due to different paths of the\nwave to the observer on the ground, the phase shifts result-\ning from an internal resonance structure of the pulsation will\ninfluence the observed onset times. Whereas the wave prop-\nagation along different paths will constitute the bulk of the\nlag time, the internal resonance structure of the pulsation can\nonly change the lag times by \u00b130 s, i.e. \u00b1 one half period.\nIn order to be able to estimate the travel times of the waves\nalong the \u201cTamao path\u201d, the local Alfve\u00b4n speed is needed.\nHere the T96 model provides the magnetic field for the calcu-\nlations, the mass density \u03c1(r) can be modelled in two parts,\nthe first applying to the plasmasphere (subscript ps), the sec-\nond to the magnetosphere (subscript ms) (compare Chi et al.,\nAnn.

(3) to model the density profile. The travel time of\nthe Alfve\u00b4nic mode along the magnetic field line as predicted\nby the T96 model was than added. Finally, the minimum\ntravel time of all stations was subtracted from all travel times\nsuch that these relative times can be compared to the relative\ntimes determined by the afore mentioned cross-correlation\ntechnique.\nOptimal values for the mass densities were found by sys-\ntematically varying these parameters until the best agree-\nment between observation and model was reached. \u03c1ps\nwas varied between 25 amu\/cm3 and 300 amu\/cm3 in steps\nof 25 amu\/cm3. The magnetospheric density was varied\nbetween 0.25 amu\/cm3 and 2.0 amu\/cm3 in 0.25 amu\/cm3\nsteps. For each pair of density values model travel times were\ncomputed. The standard deviation of the differences between\nmodel and observational time lags of all stations has been\nused as a quantifier for the goodness of fit of the input density\nvalues. The densities producing the smallest deviation were\nthen chosen as the optimal input parameters for our model.\nThese values were \u03c1ms=0.75 amu\/cm3 and \u03c1ps=50 amu\/cm3\nwhich achieved a minimal standard deviation of 7.8 s.\nA plasmaspheric density of \u03c1ps=50 amu\/cm3 seems rather\nlow, however note that changing this value to a more sensi-\nble value of 150 amu\/cm3 increases the standard deviation\nmarginally from 7.8 to 8.4 s. On the other hand changing the\nmagnetospheric density from 0.75 to 1.5 amu\/cm3 increases\nthe standard deviation to over 12 s.\nAs mentioned earlier, the observational lag times of some\nstations might have been affected by additional time shifts\ndue to local resonance effects. However the spread of the\nstation\u2019s positions over large parts of the dayside of the mag-\nnetosphere both in MLT and L-shell (compare Fig. 5) means\nthat only few of the stations will have been affected by such\nadditional shifts. Hence this intuitive measure for the good-\nness of the model is suitable for this situation.\nThe geocentric distance of the plasmapause was derived\nfrom a recent model by Larsen et al. (2007). They found\nthat the following parameters strongly correlate with the\nplasmapause position: the IMF Z-GSM component Bz, IMF\nclock angle \u03b8= arccos(Bz\/\n\u221a\nB2y+B2z ) and a merging proxy\n\u03c6=VB sin(\u03b8\/2)2, where V is the solar wind speed and B is\nthe IMF magnitude. The delay in the plasmapause response\nto the changing parameters was found to be 180 min for Bz,\n175 min for \u03b8 and 240 min for \u03c6. According to Larsen et al.\n(2007) the plasmapause position Lpp can then be calculated\nvia\nFig. 7. Observed lag times (top panel) and relative predicted lag\ntimes (bottom panel). The dotted vertical line indicates the mod-\nelled plasmapause stand-off distance. The error bars in the top panel\nare due to the different sampling frequencies of the different mag-\nnetometers.\nLpp[Re] = 0.050Bz,180 + 0.108\u03b8175 (4)\n\u22121.110 \u00d7 10\u22124\u03c6240 + 4.23,\nwhich in this case yields rpp=4.1 Re. Please note that this\nmodel does not account for the MLT dependence of Lpp.\nFor our calculations the magnetopause position was as-\nsumed to lie at rmp=10 Re. To find the location of the up-\nstream source its position was varied using the same scheme\nas for the mass densities. For 80 points along a line paral-\nlel to the Y-GSM axis at ZGSM=0 Re and XGSM=10 Re be-\ntween \u22124 Re\u2264YGSM\u22644 Re the model lag time and the stan-\ndard deviation of the difference between the lag times were\ncalculated. It was found that the best agreement, i.e. the\nlowest standard deviation, between observation and model\nis achieved when assuming the source to lie at (10, 0, 0) Re.\nThis position is consistent with what will be inferred about\nthe wave\u2019s origin later in this section.\nThe observed and the modelled lag times as a function of\nthe L-value of each station are shown in Fig. 7. The general\nagreement between the predicted and observed travel times\nis good. The model predicts the minimum travel time for\nHAD station, a result which is also obtained by the cross-\ncorrelation technique. Generally the modelled travel times\nare lower than those observed.

The two horizontal dotted lines in the\nbottom panel show the observed frequencies.\nare well reproduced by the model. Please bear in mind that\nthe time resolution for the IMAGE magnetometers is 10 s\nsuch that the observed lags can only be determined to that\naccuracy.\nAll the above observations suggest an upstream source,\nhence the solar wind data has been analysed for possible\ntriggers of the observed wave. Possible triggers for ULF\nwaves in the magnetospheric cavity include increased shear\nflow at the magnetopause, generating waves through Kelvin-\nHelmholtz-Instabilities or solar wind buffeting due to oscil-\nlations or sudden changes in the solar wind dynamic pres-\nsure. The first option is unlikely, seeing that the maximum\nshear flow is achieved at the flanks of the magnetosphere.\nHowever, the onset time analysis suggests propagation of the\nwave essentially along the X GSM axis as opposed to origi-\nnating from one of the flanks. The second option is ruled out\nsince no oscillations in the solar wind dynamic pressure can\nbe observed during the interval of interest.\nAnother wave generation mechanism is through instabili-\nties between the solar wind plasma and ions backstreaming\nfrom the Earth\u2019s bow shock. Backstreaming ions are pre-\ndominantly observed at a quasi-parallel shock, i.e. when the\nshock normal and the magnetic field vector are close to being\n(anti-)parallel. A generally used condition is that the angle\nbetween the two vectors is smaller than 30\u25e6. To our knowl-\nedge, two similar empirical models have been developed to\nestimate the frequency generated by this mechanism, one by\nTakahashi et al. (1984) and one by Le and Russell (1996).\nBoth models are parametrized by the IMF strength Btot in nT\nand the cone angle \u03b8xB as defined by\ncos(\u03b8xB) = |Bx |\/Btot. (5)\nHere we use the more recent relation found by Le and Rus-\nsell (1996) which is based on linear theory. It states that the\npredicted frequency fpred[mHz] is dependent on Btot and \u03b8xB\nas\nfpred[mHz] =\n(\n0.72 + 4.67 cos(\u03b8xB)\n)\nBtot. (6)\nDuring the event, the GEOTAIL satellite was located in-\nside the solar wind close to the Earth\u2019s bow shock on the\nevening side. From its magnetic field data \u03b8xB was calcu-\nlated and the frequency of the upstream generated waves\nat the subsolar point has been estimated using the Eq. (6)\n(see Fig. 8). The predicted frequency matches reasonably\nwell with the frequency observed, however Eq. (6) predicts\nslightly lower frequencies than those observed.\n3.2 Harmonic structure\nThe cross-phase technique was employed (Kurchashov et al.,\n1987; Waters et al., 1991) to estimate the natural frequency\nof field lines. We can then investigate whether and how the\nobserved oscillation was related to a normal mode of the con-\nsidered field lines.\nUnder two assumptions one can estimate the natural (fun-\ndamental) frequency of a field line by calculating the cross-\nphase spectrum of two adjacent stations at similar longi-\ntudes but different latitudes. Firstly it is assumed that quasi-\nrandom variations at the natural frequency of the field line are\nalways present in the data. Secondly, the natural frequency\nof the poleward station is, mainly due to the longer field line,\nslightly lower than that of the equatorward station. The nat-\nural frequency of the field line located half way between the\ntwo stations is then that frequency, at which the cross-phase\nspectrum reaches its maximum. It has been shown (e.g. Wa-\nters et al., 1991) that this technique is reasonably robust in de-\ntermining the natural frequency, even at low signal strengths.\nThe results for some exemplary SAMNET stations are\nshown in Fig. 9. The decreasing frequency with increas-\ning latitude is nicely visible, as well as an expected varia-\ntion of the fundamental frequency with local time (Waters\net al., 1995). This technique yields clearer results for data\nfrom the evening flank. However, due to the symmetry of the\nCARISMA station and SAMNET station locations, conclu-\nsions drawn from the latter may be applicable to the morning\nsector (compare Fig. 5).\nThe fundamental frequencies ffund in mHz of 16 suitable\npairs of stations from all three magnetometer arrays have\nbeen determined from the cross-phase spectra. Averaging all\ncross-phase values for each frequency bin over the time of the\nevent yielded the natural frequency as that where the cross-\nphase values were maximal. These frequencies are plotted\nover the average L-value of the station pairs in Fig. 10.\nAnn. Geophys., 26, 185\u2013199, 2008 www.ann-geophys.net\/26\/185\/2008\/\nL. Clausen et al.: Multi-instrument observations of a large scale Pc4 pulsation 195\nThe natural frequency decreases with increasing L-value,\nwith a steeper gradient inside the plasmasphere than inside\nthe magnetosphere. The position of the plasmapause can be\nidentified as the position of a \u201cbump\u201d in the curve, as indi-\ncated by an arrow in Fig. 10. Its location coincides with the\nresult derived from Eq. (4) as marked by the dotted vertical\nline. The results presented here are very similar to those pre-\nsented in Fig. 3 of Menk et al. (2004). Least-square fitting a\nstraight line to the data points in the two regimes as indicated\nby the solid lines in Fig. 10 yields two functional dependen-\ncies of the fundamental frequency ffund on L-value L:\nlog10 ffund(L) =\n{\n2.17 \u2212 0.33L, L . 4Re\n1.20 \u2212 0.04L, L & 4Re (7)\nDuring the fitting process the two points comprising the\nbump in Fig. 10 have been excluded. Using the above for-\nmula, an individual fundamental frequency for each station\nin Fig. 5 can be calculated.\nIt was already remarked that ground based magnetometer\ndata show maximal amplitudes at two different latitudes. In\nan attempt to explain this amplitude distribution, the natural\nfrequency of each station in Fig. 5 was plotted against the\nspectral power of each station\u2019s time series at 17.2 mHz.\nThe idea is that the amplitude of the pulsation and thus\nthe spectral power at 17.2 mHz of the ground based data was\nhigher at latitudes, where the driving pulsation was harmon-\nically related to the fundamental frequency because the driv-\ning wave could then have resonantly interacted with the local\nfield line.\nPanel a of Fig. 11 shows the spectral power at 17.2 mHz\nover the fundamental frequency. The colours indicate the sta-\ntion\u2019s chain, blue for SAMNET stations, orange for IMAGE\nand green for CARISMA. The station abbreviations are given\nabove or below their respective circle. The vertical bold\ndashed line marks the frequency of the driving pulsation, i.e.\n17.2 mHz. The second vertical dashed line at 6.5 mHz indi-\ncates the fundamental frequency of the field line whose sec-\nond harmonic frequency matches the driving frequency.\nThe harmonic relationship for geomagnetic field line\neigenfrequencies was studied for a dipole magnetic field by\nSchulz (1996). He found the frequency ratios at L=6 for\nthe toroidal eigenmodes to be f2\/f1=2.63 (compare Table 1\nin Schulz, 1996). For different L-values the ratio varies by\nabout 0.25. In Fig. 11 this variation has been indicated by a\ngray band.\nThe lower panels of Fig. 11 show latitude profiles of the\nphase of selected stations determined by FFT analysis. Panel\nb shows a latitude profile of CARISMA stations and panel\nc of SAMNET stations. The same stations as plotted in the\nlower panels are connected by lines in panel a.\nThe reader is reminded that the fundamental frequency of\na field line is inversely proportional to the latitude of its foot\npoint, i.e. the higher the latitude, the lower the fundamental\nfrequency. Hence, Fig. 11 can also be looked at as a latitude\nFig. 9. Cross-phase spectra of stations belonging to the SAMNET\narray.\nFig. 10. Fundamental frequency over L-value.

For an ideal FLR such a profile\nshows a peak in power at the latitude of the resonant field\nline, accompanied by a 180\u25e6 phase shift across that latitude.\nThe orange circles representing the IMAGE data offer no\nclue as to whether resonant interaction between the global\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/26\/185\/2008\/ Ann.

This is due to the\noverall small signal strength at these stations combined with\nan unfortunate position of the fundamental frequencies be-\ntween the two frequencies marked in Fig. 11.\nThe spectral powers of a latitude profile of stations be-\nlonging to the SAMNET array (HAD, YOR, ESK, CRK and\nLER) have been connected by straight lines in Fig. 11. The\naccompanying Fourier phases have been plotted in panel c.\nBoth plots provide strong evidence that across this latitude\n(\u223c54\u25e6 magnetic latitude), where the driving and local fun-\ndamental frequency matched, resonant interaction took place\nand a FLR was generated.\nThe fundamental frequency at BOR was, according to\nFig. 11, also close to that of the driving wave. Hence an en-\nhancement in power could be expected. However, the power\nat BOR is low due to the station\u2019s position at 17:00 MLT\nwhere wave power is usually low. Conversely, power at HLL\nis high although its fundamental frequency is not close to\nany of the frequencies where resonant interaction is expected.\nHence the amplitude distribution of the SAMNET data can\nonly partly be explained by resonant interaction of the driv-\ning wave with a local field line.\nA second latitude profile at higher latitudes on the dawn\nside consisting of CARISMA stations has also been marked\nin Fig. 11. It consists of the stations PINA, ISLL, GILL,\nFCHU, RANK. The corresponding Fourier phases are shown\nin panel b. Ignoring the power value at ISLL for a moment,\nagain a clear signature of a FLR emerges. This indicates\nthat the driving wave generated a FLR on the dawn side at\na latitude where the second harmonic frequency of the local\nfundamental matched the driving frequency.\nThe above discussion shows that our idea of resonant in-\nteraction can only explain parts of the amplitude distribution\nof the Fourier powers with latitude. The high power values\nat ISLL and HLL remain puzzling because their fundamen-\ntal frequency was not harmonically related to the driving fre-\nquency.\nAs can be seen in Fig. 2, the two Cluster satellites were\nlocated along the same bundle of field lines during the entire\nevent. This, together with the global, simultaneous appear-\nance of the wave in ground based magnetic data, strongly in-\ndicates that the observed wave packets were a temporal rather\nthan a spatial feature. The separation of the two spacecraft\nwas 2 Re on the same field line, therefore phase information\nfrom the magnetic and electric field data can be used to learn\nmore about the spatial structure of the wave along the field\nline.\nThe cross-phase method was used to determine the rela-\ntive phase shift of the Fourier component at 17.2 mHz and\nits evolution during the event for the field-aligned and az-\nimuthal magnetic component (not shown) between the two\nspacecraft. The phase difference of the field-aligned compo-\nnent was constant at about 0\u25e6, whereas the phase shift in the\nazimuthal component was constant at 180\u25e6.\nBecause of the finite L-shell difference between Cluster\n3 and 4, a measurable difference in resonance frequency at\nthe two positions can be expected. Hence the relative phase\nbetween the signals of the two spacecraft would change with\ntime if at their position a resonance would be observed. Since\nthis is not the case, this confirms the observation that the\nCluster satellites do not observe the signal of a resonating\nfield line but that of an almost monochromatic driver.\nSince the compressional parts of the magnetic field were\nin phase, the following considerations are only valid for the\nAlfve\u00b4nic mode. The phase shift of the azimuthal magnetic\ncomponents between the two spacecraft was 180\u25e6, whereas\nthe radial electric components were in phase. Numeri-\ncally solving the decoupled first-order wave equation along\na dipole magnetic field line as derived in Sinha and Rajaram\n(1997) yields solutions for the magnetic and electric field.\nThe following observations are qualitative and are only con-\ncerned with the node structure of the oscillation.\nThe density profile along the field line was assumed to be\n\u03c1 = \u03c10\n( r0\nr\n)n\n(8)\nwhere n is the density index and \u03c10 is the proton mass density\nat r0, the cross-point of the field line considered, and r is the\ngeocentric distance to the position of interest on the field line.\nDenton et al. (2002) found the density index at an L-value\nof 5 Re, which is the position of the Cluster satellites, to be\nAnn. Geophys., 26, 185\u2013199, 2008 www.ann-geophys.net\/26\/185\/2008\/\nL.

Superimposed are the\nscaled positions of the Cluster 3 (right of the equatorial plane) and\n4 (left) spacecraft.\naround n=1. For calculations this value was chosen and it\nis worth noting that variations of the density index did not\nsignificantly change the positions of the nodes.\nThe result of a numerical integration using the standard\nfourth-order Runge-Kutta method is shown in Fig.. 12. Note\nthat the delineation shows, for the sake of clarity, the two\nquantities at times of maximum amplitude. Superimposed\nare the positions of the Cluster spacecraft as dashed lines.\nSince the dipole field line in this sketch is represented by a\nstraight line, the positions of the spacecraft have been scaled\naccordingly.\nThe numerical solution in Fig. 12 is based on the assump-\ntion that conductivities in both the northern and southern\nionosphere are identical. This assumption does not hold for\nthe position of the field lines adjacent to the Cluster satellites\nduring the time of the event. The ionosphere at the southern\nfoot point of the involved field lines was sun lit, whereas it\nwas not at the northern end. Hence the ionospheric conduc-\ntivities are expected to be lower at the northern than at the\nsouthern foot point. However, Streltsov and Lotko (1997)\ninvestigated the influence of finite ionospheric conductiv-\nity on the structure of dispersive, nonradiative FLRs for the\nfirst four odd harmonics. Their results are based on a lin-\near, magnetically incompressible, reduced, two-fluid MHD\nmodel which includes effects of finite electron inertia (at low\naltitude) and finite electron pressure (at high altitude). They\nfound that assuming different conductivities for the north-\nern (6P=2 mho) and southern (6P=\u221emho) ionospheres\ndo not significantly change the positions of the nodes.\nThe first and fourth harmonics seem possible solutions to\nexplain the observed spatial phase shifts of the wave field,\ni.e. 0\u25e6 between the two radial electric and 180\u25e6 between the\ntwo azimuthal magnetic fields. Scha\u00a8fer et al. (2007) found\nFig. 13. Resulting wave structure when a 17.2 mHz wave is fed\ninto the Runge-Kutta algorithm.

Similar values around\n10 mHz can be extracted by eye from the cross-phase spectra\nof data from the morning side ground based magnetometers.\nHence it is more likely that the observed wave at 17.2 mHz at\nthe Cluster position has a node structure related to the funda-\nmental or the second harmonic rather than one related to the\nfourth harmonic.\nWhen feeding the Runge-Kutta algorithm with a 17.2 mHz\nwave and assuming that the electric field had a node only on\none end of the field line, the picture as delineated in Fig. 13\nemerges. It has the same format as Fig. 12. Under the as-\nsumption that the electric field had a node in the northern\nhemisphere, the observed phase shifts in the Cluster data can\nbe reproduced.\nThe astute reader will notice that the southern end of the\nfield line connects to the sun-lit hemisphere. There the con-\nductivities were probably higher than at the dark northern\nfoot point. Hence the node in the electric field is more likely\nto have been in the southern end as opposed to the northern\nas delineated in Fig. 12. However, the observed phase shifts\nin the Cluster data can only be reproduced when assuming\nthe node in the electric field to have been at the northern foot\npoint. It is possible that auroral precipitation changed the\nlocal ionospheric conductivities at the foot print of the field\nlines connected to the satellites such that the above scenario\nbecomes plausible.\nOn 7 November 2005 five wave packets in the Pc4 fre-\nquency range have been observed in ground based magne-\ntometer data from stations spanning virtually all latitudes and\nall MLTs. The most prominent of the wave packets had a\nfrequency of 17.2 mHz and an azimuthal wave number m of\nabout 1. The frequency was constant at all latitudes.\nThe onset times of the pulsation and the Poynting flux cal-\nculated from space based data show that the wave was prop-\nagating from the dayside into the nightside. This suggests\nan upstream source. Since no apparent trigger was found\nin solar wind data, we believe that the wave was generated\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/26\/185\/2008\/ Ann. Geophys., 26, 185\u2013199, 2008\n198 L. Clausen et al.: Multi-instrument observations of a large scale Pc4 pulsation\nby backstreaming ions at the Earth\u2019s bow shock. The com-\npressional part of this wave then propagated through the bow\nshock and the magnetosheath into the magnetosphere. There\nits energy partially converted into Alfve\u00b4nic modes which\nwere observed as a global phenomenon by ground instru-\nments. Space based instruments registered both modes.\nDue to the unique spatial arrangement of two Cluster\nspacecraft the harmonic structure of the wave packet along\nthe same bundle of field lines has been studied. A simple\ncomparison between the phase shifts of the azimuthal mag-\nnetic and radial electric field between the two spacecraft and\nnumerical solutions of the wave field suggests that at an L-\nvalue of 5 Re on the dawn flank the observed pulsation had\na node structure similar to the fundamental of the adjacent\nfield line. However uncertainties in the numerical solution\nexist that could effect the node structure and hence its inter-\npretation.\nUsing the cross-phase technique, fundamental frequencies\nof field lines adjacent to ground based magnetometers have\nbeen calculated and compared with that of the observed pul-\nsation and the Cluster observations. At latitudes comparable\nwith that of the Cluster foot print these data suggest that the\npulsation was oscillating at a frequency between the local\nfundamental and second harmonic frequency. This observa-\ntion is supported by the observed phase shift at the Cluster\nsatellites and numerical simulations.\nOn the dusk side the incident wave generated a FLR at a\nlatitude where the local fundamental frequency matched the\ndriving frequency. On the dawn side indications for a FLR\nare found across the latitude where the driving frequency\nmatched the second harmonic of the local fundamental.\nSome of the features of the discussed event remain puz-\nzling. The high amplitudes observed on the ground at HLL\nand ISLL cannot be explained by resonant interaction of lo-\ncal field lines and the driving wave (see Fig. 11). The split-\nting of the wave packet as observed on the ground could\nbe due to different damping rates at different latitudes (see\nFig. 1). Lower damping at lower latitudes could be responsi-\nble for the merging of two wave packets into what appears to\nbe one. And lastly the signal at double the main frequency in\nthe spacecraft data (see Fig. 3 and 4) could be connected to\nmechanisms described in Takahashi and McPherron (1982),\nHiguchi et al. (1986) and Mann et al. (1999).\nAcknowledgements. L.
