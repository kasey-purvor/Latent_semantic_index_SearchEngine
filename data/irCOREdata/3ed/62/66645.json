We construct a new infinite family of factorizations of complete bipartite\ngraphs by factors all of whose components are copies of a (fixed) complete bipartite\ngraph Kp,q. There are simple necessary conditions for such factorizations to exist. The\nfamily constructed here demonstrates sufficiency in many new cases. In particular, the\nconditions are always sufficient when q = p + 1.\n1. Introduction\nWe are dealing with simple graphs and use standard notation (see e.g. [13]). If G, H\nare two graphs, an H-factor of G is a spanning subgraph of G comprised of vertex-disjoint\ncopies of H. An H-factorization of G is a decomposition of G into edge-disjoint H-factors.\nHere we study the case where G = Km,n and H = Kp,q are complete bipartite graphs.\nThe existence of a factorization imposes a number of simple conditions on the values\nof m, n, p, q which provides straightforward arithmetical necessary conditions for such\na factorization to exist.\nTheorem 1. If p, q are positive integers with pq > 1, then a necessary condition for the\nexistence of a Kp,q-factorization of Km,n is that the following quantities are all positive\nintegers:\nm + n\np + q\n,\npm\u2212 qn\np2 \u2212 q2\n,\npn\u2212 qm\np2 \u2212 q2\n,\n(pn\u2212 qm)n\np(p\u2212 q)(m + n)\n,\n(pm\u2212 qn)n\nq(p\u2212 q)(m + n)\n(pm\u2212 qn)m\np(p\u2212 q)(m + n)\n,\n(pn\u2212 qm)m\nq(p\u2212 q)(m + n)\n,\nmn(p + q)\npq(m + n)\n\u0003\nNote that these are not all independent quantities. We call the conditions in Theorem\n1 the Basic Arithmetic Conditions (BAC) of the problem for Km,n to be Kp,q-factorizable.\nWe have the following conjecture:\nDate: September 2005.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary: 05C70.\nKey words and phrases. Factorization, complete bipartite graph.\n1\n2 NIGEL MARTIN\nBAC ConjectureThe necessary conditions stated in Theorem 1 are also sufficient.\nIt turns out that for a fixed pair p, q and a fixed ratio m : n, there is a least pair (the\nbase pair) m0, n0 in the same ratio, such that any m, n with this ratio satisfying the\nnecessary conditions must be an integral multiple of the base pair. In addition, there is\na simple construction that extends a factorization of the base pair to one of any multiple\nof it. Another simplification of the problem shows that we can assume that the pair\np, q is coprime since Ksp,sq-factorizations can be constructed from Kp,q-factorizations in\na convenient way. The details of these observations can be found in [4].\nConsiderable work has been done on this conjecture: The case p = 1, q = 2 was first\nproved in [9]. This was reproved by the author in [4] together with half the solution for\np = 1 and m = n. The balanced case (m = n) has now been completed through a series of\npapers [5, 6, 7]. The general case for p = 2, q = 3 was solved in [12] and for p = 1, q = 3\nin [8], which also covered a significant infinite family of situations.\nFrom this point we assume that gcd(p, q) = 1.\nThe most productive general method of construction seems to be to examine the way\nin which copies of Kp,q are oriented in any factor of Km,n. Let X, Y be the two sets of\nvertices making up the bipartition of Km,n (|X| = m, |Y | = n). In any Kp,q-factor, there\nwill be a number \u03be of copies of Kp,q with the q-set in X and the p-set in Y , and there\nwill be a number \u03b7 with this situation reversed. The ratio \u03be : \u03b7 is common to each of\nthe factors in the factorization. We call this the balance ratio. From this it is clear that\nm = q\u03be + p\u03b7, n = p\u03be + q\u03b7.\nFurther analysis of this (see [4]) shows that we can restate the necessary conditions for\nthe base pair in another way via the balance ratio.\nTheorem 2. Let x0, y0 be the pair of integers such that m0 = qx0 + py0, n0 = px0 + qy0\nis the base pair for the balance ratio \u03be : \u03b7, then the pair x0, y0 is the least such in this\nratio that the quantity (p\u2212 q)x0y0\/pq(x0 + y0) is an integer. \u0003\nAn alternative formulation of this starts with a given coprime ratio pair and deduces\nthe base pair.\nTheorem 3. Let p < q and x, y be coprime pairs of positive integers (p 6= q), and let d\nbe the denominator of the rational number (q\u2212 p)xy\/pq(x + y) expressed in lowest terms.\nUNBALANCED BIPARTITE FACTORIZATIONS 3\nThen the base pair for complete bipartite Kp,q-factorizations with balance ratio x : y is\nm0 = d(qx + py), n0 = d(px + qy). \u0003\nNote that, in [4], the roles of x and y are reversed to the way presented here. This does\nnot affect the thrust of the argument, however.\nIn [8] we proved the BAC Conjecture for an infinite family of cases where p = 1\nand gcd(q \u2212 1, x + y) = 2. The aim of this paper is to prove it for all cases where\ngcd(q\u2212 p, x + y) = 1. As a corollary, it follows that the BAC Conjecture is true wherever\nq = p+1, a result previously also obtained by B. Du and J. Wang in [2]. The construction\nis given in Section 3.\nTo put this approach into context, however, we first go back to a rather impenetrable\ncondition stated in [4] which described the extent to which the tiling construction in that\npaper was capable of solving the base case. A more detailed analysis in Section 2 results\nin a much simpler restatement of the condition, and shows that the result of the new\nconstruction in Section 3 is strictly stronger than before.\n2. The Planar Tiling Construction\nIn [4], a planar tiling construction was used to give a very large infinite family of\nbipartite factorizations, and we were able to determine which of these gave a base case\nsolution in the following way.\nGiven our p < q and a balance ration x : y (both coprime pairs), the construction\nof the planar tiling involves finding the unique coprime pair v, h such that hp\nvq\n= x\ny\n.\nProposition 4.1 of [4] then establishes when the standard tiling gives the base case solution.\nIn particular\nProposition 4. Let k = gcd(vq + hp, (p\u2212q)hv)\ngcd(vq,hp)\n). Then if k = 1 the BAC conjecture is\ntrue for Kp,q-factorizations with balance ratio x : y. \u0003\nWe examine the quantity k in more detail. First set p1 = gcd(x, p), p2 = gcd(y, p),\nq1 = gcd(x, q), and q2 = gcd(y, q) so that x = p1q1x0, y = p2q2y0, p = p1p2p0, q = q1q2q0.\nFrom the assumption that gcd(p, q) = gcd(x, y) = 1, it is straightforward to show that the\nquantities p1, p2, q1, q2, x0, y0, p0, q0 are all pairwise coprime apart from possibly (p1, x0),\n(q1, x0), (p2, y0), (q2, y0), (pi, p0) and (qi, q0) (i = 1, 2).\n4 NIGEL MARTIN\nFrom the data\nh\nv\n=\nqx\npy\n=\nq21x0q0\np22p0y0\nand from coprimeness h = q21x0q0 and v = p\n2\n2p0y0. Then vq = p\n2\n2q1q2p0y0q0 = p2q1p0q0y\nand hp = p1p2q\n2\n1x0p0q0 = p2q1p0q0x so,\ngcd(vq, hp) = p2q1p0q0 gcd(y, x) = p2q1p0q0\nNow we can recalculate the constant k in Proposition 4 as\nk = gcd(vq + hp,\n(p\u2212 q)hv)\ngcd(vq, hp)\n)\n= gcd(p2q1p0q0(x + y),\n(p\u2212 q)p22p0y0q\n2\n1x0q0\np2q1p0q0\n)\n= p2q1 gcd(p0q0(x + y), (p\u2212 q)x0y0)\n= p2q1 gcd(x + y, (p\u2212 q)x0y0)\n= p2q1 gcd(x + y, p\u2212 q) = gcd(y, p) gcd(x, q) gcd(x + y, p\u2212 q)\nusing the fact that p0|p and gcd(p0, q) = gcd(p0, x0) = gcd(p0, y0) = 1; similarly for q0.\nThe last equality comes as x0|x and gcd(x, y) = 1; similarly for y0. In summary we have\nTheorem 5. The planar tiling construction in [4] for Kp,q-factorizations with balance\nratio x : y gives a factorization of Kkm,kn where Km,n is the base case and\nk = gcd(y, p) gcd(x, q) gcd(x + y, p\u2212 q). \u0003\nNote that the roles of x and y may be reversed, if necessary, to improve the result.\n3. The case gcd(q \u2212 p, x + y) = 1\nTheorem 5 shows that gcd(q \u2212 p, x + y) is a key number and this is reinforced by the\nresults of [8] where the value 2 is dealt with extensively [for the case p = 1].\nTheorem 6. The BAC Conjecture is true whenever gcd(q \u2212 p, x + y) = 1.\nProof. Without loss, we assume that p < q, with gcd(p, q) = gcd(x, y) = 1. As before, set\np = p0p1p2, q = q0q1q2, x = p1q1x0 and y = p2q2y0, where p1 = gcd(p, x), p2 = gcd(p, y),\nq1 = gcd(q, x) and q2 = gcd(q, y).\nFrom Theorem 3, we find that d = p0q0(x + y) so that the base case has m = p0q0(x +\ny)(qx+py) = p0q0p1q2(x+y)\u00b5, where \u00b5 = q0q\n2\n1x0 +p0p\n2\n2y0, and n = p0q0(x+y)(px+qy) =\nUNBALANCED BIPARTITE FACTORIZATIONS 5\np0q0p2q1(x+y)\u03bd, where \u03bd = p0p\n2\n1x0+q0q\n2\n2y0. The factor size is p0q0(x+y)\n2pq, which implies\nthat there are \u00b5\u03bd factors to account for.\nThe edges of Km,n correspond naturally with the places in an m \u00d7 n matrix F that\nwe call the factor matrix. We aim to populate the entries of F with values in the range\n1, . . . , \u00b5\u03bd so that entries with the same value correspond to the edges of the respective\nKp,q-factors.\nEach factor is a collection of copies of Kp,q. Those with q vertices in the m-set of the\nbipartition of Km,n are called vertical and those with q vertices in the n-set are called\nhorizontal.\nF will be built up in rectangular blocks of increasing sizes. We define first those relating\nto the vertical factor pieces.\nLet J be a q0q2\u00b5\u00d7p0p2\u03bd matrix with general term J\u03b1\u03b2. We can express \u03b1 = (a\u22121)q0q2+c\nand \u03b2 = (b \u2212 1)p0p2 + d uniquely for a, b, c, d where 1 \u2264 a \u2264 \u00b5, 1 \u2264 b \u2264 \u03bd, 1 \u2264 c \u2264 q0q2\nand 1 \u2264 d \u2264 p0p2. Set J\u03b1\u03b2 = (a \u2212 1)\u03bd + b and J is then decomposable as a \u00b5 \u00d7 \u03bd array\nof rectangular q0q2 \u00d7 p0p2 blocks (called microblocks) where each microblock has a single\nfactor label and the labels read in the natural order across J from left to right and from\ntop to bottom.\nJ is a model with rotational variants J(i, j) called miniblocks. J(i, j) is obtained by\nrotating the rows of J cyclically downwards iq0q2 places and the columns cyclically to\nthe right jp0p2 places. The effect is to leave a microblock structure with labels shifted\ncyclically down i places and to the right j places. Note that J = J(0, 0).\nThe following is a figurative example with \u00b5 = 5, \u03bd = 7, each square is a microblock\nand has all its elements with the given label.\nJ(0, 0) =\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n8 9 10 11 12 13 14\n15 16 17 18 19 20 21\n22 23 24 25 26 27 28\n29 30 31 32 33 24 35\n, J(1, 2) =\n24 35 29 30 31 32 33\n6 7 1 2 3 4 5\n13 14 8 9 10 11 12\n20 21 15 16 17 18 19\n27 28 22 23 24 25 26\nUsing these, we next construct the p0p1q0q2\u00b5 \u00d7 p0p2q0q1\u03bd matrix H as a p0p1 \u00d7 q0q1\nblock array of miniblock variants of J . Specifically, if 1 \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 p0p1 and 1 \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264 q0q1,\nthen the miniblock of H of row index \u03b3 and column index \u03b4 is defined to be J(\u03b4\u22121, \u03b3\u22121).\n6 NIGEL MARTIN\nHere is an example with \u00b5 = 5, \u03bd = 7, p0p1 = 3, q0q1 = 4. The squares represent\nmicroblocks, the shaded one being the microblock with label 1, and the bolder subdividing\nlines indicating the miniblocks structure of H.\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n1 2 3 4\n1\n2\n3\nFigure 1\nNote that p0p1 < \u03bd and q0q1 < \u00b5, so that all the miniblocks comprising H are distinct\n(i.e. none can be a rotation back to J(0, 0)). This ensures that H has the following\nproperties:\nLemma 7. (1) In every column and every row of microblocks in H, a given factor\nlabel is associated with at most one microblock.\n(2) Within every column (respectively row) of miniblocks in H, a given factor label\nis associated with a cyclically contiguous set of p0p1 (respectively q0q1) microblock\ncolumns (respectively rows). \u0003\nHere the term \u201ccyclically contiguous\u201d means a sequence of consecutive columns (or\nrows) where, if necessary, the leftmost (respectively top) microblock column (row) of a\nminiblock column (row) follows cyclically after the rightmost column (bottom row).\nH also has rotational variants H(i, j). For 0 \u2264 i < q1x0 and 0 \u2264 j < p1x0, H(i, j) is\nthe array of miniblocks where, for 1 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 p0p1 and 1 \u2264 \u03b2 \u2264 q0q1, the miniblock with\nrow index \u03b1 and column index \u03b2 is H(i, j)\u03b1\u03b2 = J(iq0q1 + \u03b2 \u2212 1, jp0p1 + \u03b1\u2212 1).\nLemma 8. If i 6= i\u2032, then in any fixed microblock row the set of factor labels occurring in\nH(i, j) is disjoint from the set of factor labels occurring in H(i\u2032, j). Similarly, if j 6= j \u2032,\nin any fixed microblock column the set of factor labels occurring in H(i, j) is disjoint from\nthe set of factor labels occurring in H(i, j \u2032).\nUNBALANCED BIPARTITE FACTORIZATIONS 7\nProof. The restriction on the ranges of i, j, imply that iq0q1 + \u03b2 \u2212 1 < \u00b5 and jp0p1 +\n\u03b1\u2212 1 < \u03bd. Thus there is no chance of any \u201cover rotation\u201d to cause unwanted factor label\nduplication in rows or columns. \u0003\nNow we can place the vertical factor pieces in F . First decompose F as an (x+y)\u00d7(x+y)\narray G of blocks of size p0p1q0q2\u00b5\u00d7 p0p2q0q1\u03bd (i.e. of size equal to H). We first assign to\nthe partial row G11, . . . , G1x. Recall that x = p1q1x0. For 1 \u2264 j \u2264 x write j \u2212 1 = rp1 + s\nuniquely for 0 \u2264 s < p1, 0 \u2264 r < q1x0, and write r = tq1 + u uniquely for 0 \u2264 u < q1,\n0 \u2264 t < x0. Then define G1j = H(r, s + tp1). Finally, for 2 \u2264 i \u2264 (x + y), and 1 \u2264 v \u2264 x,\ndefine j \u2261 i + v \u2212 1 (mod x + y) in the range 1, . . . , x + y, and Gij = G1v. This has the\neffect of copying the assignments of the top row of G by a process of diagonal replication\ninto the other rows; i.e. as we go down one row we shift the assignment cyclically one\nplace to the right.\nThe following detail of the sequence of H-type blocks in the first row of G may help to\nelucidate the structure of what is going on.:\nH(0, 0), H(0, 1), . . . , H(0, p1 \u2212 1),\nH(1, 0), H(1, 1), . . . , H(1, p1 \u2212 1), . . . ,\nH(q1 \u2212 1, 0), . . . , H(q1 \u2212 1, p1 \u2212 1),\nH(q1, p1), H(q1, p1 + 1), . . . , H(2q1 \u2212 1, 2p1 \u2212 1),\nH(2q1, 2p1), . . . , H(3q1 \u2212 1, 3p1 \u2212 1),\n. . . , H((x0 \u2212 1)q1, (x0 \u2212 1)p1), . . . , H((x0 \u2212 1)a1, x0p1 \u2212 1),\n. . . , H(x0q1 \u2212 1, (x0 \u2212 1)p1), . . . , H(x0q1 \u2212 1, x0p1 \u2212 1)\nLemma 9. This definition determines an assignment of vertical copies of Kp,q so that no\ntwo copies with the same factor label overlap in a column or in a row.\nProof. Consider the factor label 1 as an exemplar. The construction of H shows 1 occu-\npying the microblock columns of index 1 . . . p0p1 in each miniblock column and rows of\nindex 1 . . . q0q1 in each miniblock row. In the rotational variant H(i, j) these become mi-\ncroblock columns of index jp0p1 +1 . . . (j+1)p0p1 and rows of index iq0q1 +1 . . . (i+1)q0q1\nrespectively.\nSo in the actual construction in the partial first row of G, we have blocks H(r, s + tp1)\nwhere the microblock column coverage is (s+tp1)p0p1+1 . . . (s+tp1+1)p0p1 and microblock\nrow coverage rq0q1 + 1 . . . (r + 1)q0q1.\n8 NIGEL MARTIN\nThen reading across left to right, repetitions in microblock rows can only occur when\nr is fixed, and there are precisely p1 for each value of r. But a microblock occupies p0p2\ncolumns of F , so across any given microblock row where label 1 occurs, we have identified\na microblock-row-subarrray with p0p2p1 = p columns (and q0q2 rows) in F .\nNext, for fixed r, the microblock columns labelled 1 change to contiguous but non-\noverlapping microblock columns as the value of s + tp1 changes. On the other hand, if r\nchanges and s + tp1 is fixed, the columns microblock coincide.\nBut, as can be seen from the extended listing above, reading left ro right along a partial\nrow of blocks in the G-structure these H-blocks come in groups of length p1. This means\nthat the diagonal replication procedure for completing all the partial rows of G ensures\nthat the microblock-row-subarrrays stack on top of each other in such a way that their\nmicroblock columns are either disjoint or are identical, with the latter case occurring only\nwhen the value of s + tp1 is the same. For any such value, this occurs (for the varying r,\nprecisely q1 times (the range of the variable u), so that combining them we get a subarray\nwith total row coverage of size q0q2q1 = q in F to go with the column coverage of size\np. So we have identified a collection of disjoint vertical copies of Kp,q as required, for the\nlabel 1.\nFinally, while the label 1 is an exemplar, it is typical because of the cyclical nature of\nthe constructions. \u0003\nAgain we need to know the vertical and horizontal coverage of factor labels within\nminiblocks.\nLemma 10. (1) Within every column (resp. row) of miniblocks in G thus far defined,\na given factor label is associated with a cyclically contiguous set of p0p1\n2x0 (resp.\nq0q1\n2x0) microblock columns (resp. rows).\n(2) p0p1\n2x0 < \u03bd and q0q1\n2x0 < \u00b5 so there is no danger of the resulting contiguous sets\nof rows and columns rotating back onto themselves.\nUNBALANCED BIPARTITE FACTORIZATIONS 9\nProof. From Lemma 7, we know that we have p0p1 microblock column coverage and q0q1\nmicroblock row coverage in any Gij. Looking along a defined row of G, we have p1q1x0 such\nsituations, with q1x0 groups where p1 have identical coverage (being part of a q\u00d7 p array\nof the relevant factor label). Each time a single rotation is made to enter the next one\nof these groups we cover another q0q1 rows that are cyclically contiguous to the previous\nset. Since this happens q1x0 times in all, we get the row coverage as stated.\nSimilarly for the column coverage. \u0003\nThis completes the definition of the vertical factor pieces. The approach for the hori-\nzontal pieces is similar, but we require a new miniblock structure.\n1 35 2 29 3 30 4 31 5 32 6 33 7 34\n34 1 35 2 29 3 30 4 31 5 32 6 33 7\n7 34 1 35 2 29 3 30 4 31 5 32 6 33\n8 7 9 1 10 2 11 3 12 4 13 5 14 6\n6 8 7 9 1 10 2 11 3 12 4 13 5 14\n14 6 8 7 9 1 10 2 11 3 12 4 13 5\n15 14 16 8 17 9 18 10 19 11 20 12 21 13\n13 15 14 16 8 17 9 18 10 19 11 20 12 21\n21 13 15 14 16 8 17 9 18 10 19 11 20 12\n22 21 23 15 24 16 25 17 26 18 27 19 28 20\n20 22 21 23 15 24 16 25 17 26 18 27 19 28\n28 20 22 21 23 15 24 16 25 17 26 18 27 19\n29 28 30 22 31 23 32 24 33 25 34 26 35 27\n27 29 28 30 22 31 23 32 24 33 25 34 26 35\n35 27 29 28 30 22 31 23 32 24 33 25 34 26\nFigure 2\nLet a, b, c, d be positive mutually coprime integers. Construct an ac\u00d7 bd array L as\nfollows: For 1 \u2264 s \u2264 c, 1 \u2264 t \u2264 d, assign the label d(s \u2212 1) + t to the entries Lij where\ni = a(s\u22121)+\u03b1, j = b(t\u22121)+\u03b1 for 1 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 ab, where the subscripts are reduced modulo\nac and bd respectively into the correct ranges.\n10 NIGEL MARTIN\nNote that there are a total of abcd assignments, which is the correct number, so we\nneed to check that no entry of K is assigned more than once. This follows quickly from\nthe coprime assumption.\nThe case with a = 3, b = 2, c = 5, d = 7 is shown in Figure 2; entries with label 1\nhave been emboldened.\nIn our situation we take a = q0q2, b = p0p2, c = \u00b5 and d = \u03bd which we know to be\nmutually coprime. This is our standard model miniblock M . Note that the construction\nis such that any given label occupies a diagonal sequence of q0q2p0p2 entries in M and that\nlooking rightwards by p0p2 generally increases the label by 1 while looking downwards by\nq0q2 generally increases the label by \u03bd.\nWe construct cyclic variants M(i, j) of M , by rotating columns p0p\n2\n1x0p0p2 + iq0q2p0p2\nplaces cyclically to the right and rows q0q\n2\n1x0q0q2 + jq0q2p0p2 places cyclically down.\nLemma 10 defines columns and rows of miniblocks already covered by a given label.\nThe effect of the summands p0p\n2\n1x0p0p2 and q0q\n2\n1x0q0q2 is to ensure that we avoid these in\nanything previously defined. The other two summand ensure that varying i and j avoids\npartial overlaps with the diagonals (of length q0q2p0p2)\nFrom each miniblocks M(i, j), we construct a larger block L(i, j) as a p0p1\u00d7 q0q1 array\nof miniblocks all equal to M(i, j).\nLemma 11. (1) Within every column (resp. row) of miniblocks in L(i, j), a given\nfactor label is associated with a cyclically contiguous set of p0p2q0q2 columns (resp.\nrows).\n(2) For each factor label \u03c6, the entries with that label contribute a total of p0p2q0q2\nsubarrays of size p0p1\u00d7 q0q1, with non-overlapping rows and columns, but covering\nthe contiguous sets as described above. \u0003\nWe now use these to fill in the remaining G-blocks of F and to define all the required\nhorizontal factors. The approach is to complete the first row of G and copy this over the\nremaining rows by diagonal replication.\nSo we define the G1,x+j , 1 \u2264 j \u2264 y = p2q2y0. Working as in the vertical case, given\nj, we can define unique integers r, s, t where j \u2212 1 = rq2 + s, r = tp2 + u, 0 \u2264 s <\nq2, 0 \u2264 u < p2, 0 \u2264 t < y0, from which we set G1,x+j = L(r, s + tq2). We then extend\nthis over the remainder of G by assigning G\u03b1\u03b2 = G1,\u03b1\u2212\u03b2+1 for 2 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 (x + y) and\nUNBALANCED BIPARTITE FACTORIZATIONS 11\nx+1 \u2264 (\u03b1\u2212\u03b2 +1) \u2264 x+y where all the calculations are taken modulo x+y in the range\n1, . . . , x + y.\nLemma 12. This definition determines an assignment of horizontal copies of Kp,q so that\nno two copies with the same factor label overlap in a column or in a row.\nProof. This follows mutatis mutandis using the same argument as for the proof of Lemma\n9. \u0003\nThe corresponding analysis also proves the following.\nLemma 13. (1) Within every column (resp. row) of miniblocks in G defined in the\nsecond stage, a given factor label is associated with a cyclically contiguous set of\nq0q2\n2y0 (resp. p0p2\n2y0) microblock columns (resp. rows).\n(2) q0q2\n2y0 < \u03bd and p0p2\n2y0 < \u00b5 so there is no danger of the resulting contiguous sets\nof rows and columns rotating back onto themselves.\nFinally, we observe that the construction in the horizontal stage produces factor la-\nbellings that do not overlap vertically or horizontally with those created in the vertical\nstage since \u00b5 and \u03bd are the respective sums of the two ranges of coverage calculated in\nLemmas 10 and 13. It follows by counting together with the properties set out in Lemmas\n7 to 13 that we must have constructed the factorization required. So the proof of Theorem\n6 is complete. \u0003\nCorollary 14. For all p \u2265 1, the BAC-conjecture for Kp,p+1 factorizations is true. \u0003\nReferences\n[1] B.
