High resolution soil geochemical data exist for only part of England and Wales \n(E&W), whilst stream sediment data cover the entire landscape.  We present a novel \nmethodology for estimating soil equivalent ABCs for PHEs from high-resolution (HR) stream \nsediment geochemical data grouped by common parent materials (PM), using arsenic (As) as \nan example.  We use geometric mean (GM) values for local PM groups to investigate different \napproaches for transforming sediment to soil equivalent concentrations.  We use holdout \nvalidation to assess: i) the optimum number of samples for calculating local GM values, and \nii) the optimum scale at which to group data when using linear regression analysis to estimate \nGM soil ABCs from local sediment geochemical values.  Holdout validation showed that the \nsmallest differences were generally observed when five observations were used to calculate \nthe GM and that these should be grouped over the smallest possible area in order to \nencompass soils over PMs with elevated GM As concentrations.  We estimate and map GM \nABCs for arsenic in mineral soil across all of E&W within delineations of PM polygons.  \nErrors for the estimation of soil equivalent GM As ABCs based on sediment data for an \nindependent validation set were of a similar magnitude to those from holdout validation \napplied to the original data suggesting the approach is robust.  Our estimates of soil equivalent \nABCs suggest that As exceeds the regulatory threshold used in risk assessments for residential \nland use (20 mg kg-1) across 16 % of the landscape of E&W.  We discuss the applicability of \nthe method for cognate landscapes, and potential refinements. \nKeywords: geometric mean, arsenic, parent material, regression, England, Wales \n__________________________________________________________________________ \nNational-scale estimation of soil ABCs: page 3 of 33 \n1. Introduction \n \nThe ambient background concentration (ABC) of a potentially harmful element (PHE) in \ntopsoil is the sum of the natural (geogenic) and non-natural diffuse components (ISO, 2005, \nZhao et al., 2007).  In central England, a significant proportion of the landscape has naturally \nelevated topsoil concentrations of the PHE arsenic (Rawlins et al., 2002) exceeding the Soil \nGuideline Value (SGV) of 20 mg kg-1 for residential land use (DEFRA & EA, 2002a).  \nRegulatory authorities need to know where ABCs are likely to exceed this threshold. \nApproaches have been proposed to estimate topsoil ABCs for seven PHEs across parts \nof the globe using their statistical relationships with total Fe and Mn (Hamon et al., 2004), \nwhilst Zhao et al. (2007) did so for several elements across England and Wales (E&W) based \non their associations with particle-size fractions.  One disadvantage of such approaches is that \nthey require further measurements to be made on samples for which estimates of ABCs are \nrequired, and so entail further cost.  If high-resolution (HR; sampling intensities greater than 1 \nsample per 3 km2) topsoil data were available, it would be possible to provide estimates of \nABCs by mapping using some form of local interpolation.  Alternatively, where the \ndistribution of elevated ABCs are spatially very complex because they relate to the convoluted \noutcrops of PHE-enriched soil parent materials (PMs) such as in central England (Palumbo-\nRoe et al., 2005), we could avoid large errors at these boundaries if we derive estimates of \nABCs within delineations of the PM mapping units.  This is because soil parent material is the \nprimary control on ABCs in UK topsoil for PHEs including As, Cr and Ni (Rawlins et al., \n2003). \nAt present, this latter mapping approach cannot be used for all of E&W because HR \nsoil geochemical data are only available for around 27 % (area A+B\/A+B+C+D in Figure 1) \nof the landscape; these are soil data from the G-BASE project of the British Geological \nSurvey (Johnson et al., 2005).  However, there are high-resolution stream sediment \nNational-scale estimation of soil ABCs: page 4 of 33 \ngeochemical data for the remainder of the country described by Webb et al. (1978) and \nJohnson et al. (2005).  Preliminary work based on data collected under the G-BASE project \nshowed strong correlations between certain PHEs in soil and stream sediment associated with \nPM groups across parts of England.  Given that the types of PM in this region appear to be \nrepresentative of much of E&W \u2013 comprising a range of geological periods and a significant \nproportion of Quaternary deposits \u2013 we might expect similar relationships to extend \nnationwide.  It may therefore be possible to use the sediment data to estimate topsoil \nequivalent ABCs for selected PHEs in those areas where soil data are not available.  A \nprevious study by Cannon et al. (2004) using a technique of adjusting sediment to soil \nconcentrations reported strong correlations for certain elements across part of Wisconsin, and \nsuggested such an approach could be useful for estimating background values. In contrast, \nGarrett et al. (2005) were unable to find a routine way of estimating soil concentrations from \nstream sediment geochemical data in the Upper Coastal Plain of South Carolina, USA due to \nthe complexity of the processes affecting stream sediments during their transformation from \nsoils.  \nIn this paper we present a new methodology for the estimation of topsoil equivalent \nABCs for three PHEs (As, Cr, Ni) using HR stream sediment data, and demonstrate its \napplication to soil As.  We establish statistical relationships between geometric mean values of \nsoil and stream sediment PHE concentrations grouped by PM, and use these to estimate \nmineral topsoil equivalent concentrations of As, which we map within delineations of the PM \npolygons. We use an independent dataset to demonstrate the robustness of our approach.  We \npresent the first national scale map of topsoil As ABCs (based on geometric mean values for \ndelineations of PM polygons) resulting from the application of our methodology.  We also \nshow how these data can be used to estimate the proportion of samples exceeding a threshold \nused in regulation related to contaminated land assessments.  Finally, we discuss the \nNational-scale estimation of soil ABCs: page 5 of 33 \nuncertainties associated with our methodology, its wider implications and potential \nrefinements. \n \n2. Exploratory data analyses for estimating soil equivalent ABCs \nWe require a method to transform the available HR stream sediment and deeper soil \ngeochemical data for E&W (Figure 1) into topsoil equivalent ABCs.  The HR geochemical \nsurvey data used in this study, including analytical methods, sampling density and dates are \nsummarised in Table 1 and Figure 1. Wolfson stream sediment samples were taken from small \ntributaries with catchments that rarely exceeded 5-10 km2 whilst the GBASE stream sediment \nsamples were collected from small, first or second order, streams to give an average sampling \ndensity of one sample per 1.5 to 2 km2. Total element concentrations were determined so these \nare compatible with the SGV regulatory thresholds for England and Wales.   The data can be \nseparated into four, spatially overlapping combinations of topsoil, subsoil and stream \nsediments from the GBASE survey, and Wolfson stream sediment survey (regions A to D; \nFigure 1).  Topsoil (0-15cm depth) geochemical data from the GBASE survey were available \nin region A.  Deeper soil (35-50cm depth) geochemical data from GBASE were available in \nregions A+B.  Stream sediment geochemical data from the GBASE survey were available in \nregions A+B+C covering large areas of north and central England.  Finally, stream sediment \ngeochemical data are available for all of E&W (A+B+C+D) from the Wolfson Atlas. \nWe undertook two sets of exploratory analyses.  First, we created scatterplots of GM \nconcentrations in topsoil versus deeper soil for As, Cr and Ni grouped by soil PM for area A \n(Figure 2) and fitted linear regressions to them using least squares (see Table 2).  These \nhighlight very strong linear relationships \u2013 the slopes are all close to one.  The slope of the \nlinear regression between GM topsoil and deeper soil As (shown in Figure 2a) is 1.01, so we \nfelt justified in treating PM grouped topsoil and subsoil As values as equivalent.  For Ni and \nCr, we would need to apply a linear transformation to estimate GM concentrations based on \nNational-scale estimation of soil ABCs: page 6 of 33 \nsamples grouped by PM. Higher Cr and Ni concentrations in the <150 \u00b5m fraction of deeper \nsoils compared with the <2mm fraction of topsoils is to be expected whilst the approximately \nequivalent As concentrations in the two soil sampling media requires further investigation. \nSecond, we assessed the significance of PM in determining the spatial distribution of As, Cr \nand Ni in the large GBASE dataset for deeper soils and GBASE stream sediments for area \nA+B (Figure 1).  The results, summarised in Table 3, demonstrate the primary importance of \nPM in determining the concentrations of these elements in both soil and stream sediment, with \nthe variance accounted for ranging from 20 to 43%.  There were strong correlations between \ngeometric mean (GM) PHE concentrations in soil and stream sediment when the data were \ngrouped by PM.  We therefore considered that it was justified to investigate whether we could \nestimate soil equivalent ABCs using stream sediment PHE concentrations in areas C+D \n(Figure 1) where no soil geochemical data were available. \n Given that the samples are grouped by PM, we required a statistical measure of location \nto express the ABC.  We examined features of the statistical distributions of As, Cr and Ni for \nareas A+B (Figure 1) where we can compare soil and stream sediment geochemical data (see \nTable 3).  All of the variates had large positive skewness coefficients for each of the PHEs.  \nAfter transforming the data by taking natural logarithms the skewness coefficients were \ngenerally in the range [-1,1] suggesting that the majority of the original data were \napproximately log-normally distributed.  Traditional measures of statistical location (mean) \nand scale (standard deviation) are biased when applied to skewed distributions.  To overcome \nthis we used the geometric mean (GM) and geometric standard deviation (GSD) to establish \nstatistical relationships between variates using the original, untransformed data.  Our estimates \nof ABCs are GM values for PM groups, which are similar to the medians in each distribution.  \nThe latter was the parameter proposed for estimating ABCs by ISO (2005). However, GM \nprovides a better estimate of ABC than median when calculating ABCs from small numbers of \nsamples, especially for PMs with relatively high arsenic concentrations.  \nNational-scale estimation of soil ABCs: page 7 of 33 \nIn the next section we describe how we evaluated different features of an approach for \nthe conversion of stream sediment to soil equivalent ABCs using statistical relationships based \non data grouped by PM.  Specifically, we use holdout validation to test: i) different scales for \ngrouping soil and stream sediment geochemical data by PM and, ii) the optimum number of \nneighbouring samples required to calculate GM concentrations .  We then demonstrate how \nlinear regression relationships between sediment and soil for common PM groups can be used \nto estimate ABCs in topsoil in areas C+D in Figure 1.  Prior to this we transformed the \nWolfson stream sediment in southern England (area D; Figure 1) to their G-BASE equivalents \nusing linear quantile transformation.   \n \n3. Statistical and mapping methods \n \nBelow we describe the detailed methodology for transformation of the available stream \nsediment As data into soil equivalent ABCs with reference to a sequence of steps shown in a \nflowchart (Figure 3). \n \n3.1. Linear quantile transformation (steps 1 and 2) \nTo transform the Wolfson data to the G-BASE sediment data we used linear quantile \ntransformation (Daneshfar and Cameron, 1998, Darnley et al., 1995, Heyde, 1986).  Here we \nbriefly summarise the theory of quantile transformation.  If F(x) is some distribution function \non the real line, and G(x) is another, and we have a random variable Y with distribution \nfunction G, we want to create a random function X with distribution function F, so that the \ndifference |X \u2212 Y| is as small as possible. This can be achieved if we define the variable \u03be \nwhich is uniformly distributed on [0, 1] by \u03be = G(Y ), and then set X = F\u22121(\u03be).  In our case the \nrandom variable X are concentrations of a PHE in Wolfson sediment samples, and variable Y \nare concentrations for the same PHE in the G-BASE samples for the same geographic area \nNational-scale estimation of soil ABCs: page 8 of 33 \n(A+B+C in Figure 1).  We can then fit a linear regression using least squares for a series of \nquantiles (e.g. p = 0.1, 0.2, . . . , 0.9) between the target distribution (Yp) and the source (Xp).  \nWe can apply the regression to estimate the concentrations of Y (G-BASE) from X (Wolfson).  \nWe assume that the sampling method is unbiased in both cases, and that that X and Y are \nrelated by a positive, linear scaling.  \n \n3.2. Parent material polygon delineations as geochemical mapping units (Step 3) \nIn this study, we defined PM classes based on the concatenation of separate codes for the \nunderlying bedrock and any superficial deposits present (see Figure 4).  The codes are \ngenerally derived from digital versions of the 1:50,000 maps of bedrock geology and \nsuperficial deposits for E&W, part of DigMap GB (British Geological Survey, 2006).  Initially \na total of ca. 1.9 million individually delineated polygons were created in ArcMapTM GIS \n(ESRI) by separating unioned bedrock and superficial geology polygons using a 1-km grid \naligned to the British National Grid (see Figure 4).  There was frequently more than one \npolygon of a PM within a 1-km grid square.  In such cases, the average centroid for a PM in a \n1-km grid was calculated from the centroids of the individual polygons of that PM within the \n1-km grid square (see bottom right 1km grid square in Figure 4).  There are approximately \n650,000 average 1km-PM centroids across E&W and these are used to estimate the GM \nconcentrations for the delineations of the 1km-PM polygons used as geochemical mapping \nunits in this study.  The use of the average centroids, rather than individual 1km-PM polygon \ncentroids reduced geochemical mapping computation time by approximately 65%. We used a \nspatial join procedure (ArcMapTM software (ESRI)) to link the geochemical sampling sites to \ntheir PM code.  The GM ABC for each PM in a 1-km grid square is calculated from the n \ngeochemical samples located on the same PM that are nearest to the average 1km-PM \ncentroid. The optimum number (n) of samples for estimation of GM was determined using \nholdout validation, as explained below.   \nNational-scale estimation of soil ABCs: page 9 of 33 \n \n3.3. Holdout validation to determine optimum number of samples for estimating sediment and \nsoil GM (step 4) \nWe wished to assess the optimum number of local sediment or soil samples with the same PM \ncode for calculating GM values for each 1km-PM polygon.  This is likely to vary due to a \nrange of factors including the spatial distribution of sampling locations, the size and shape of \nPM polygons, and drainage pattern.  We used a script written in the GIS package ArcViewTM \n(ESRI) which identified for each average 1km-PM polygon centroid, the nearest \u2018n\u2019 (1, 2, 3, 4 \n, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 20 and 30) soil or sediment sampling sites located on the same PM.  This \nscript returned from the n nearest sediment or soil samples for each PM class: i) the GM As \nconcentration, ii) the inverse distance weighted value of their natural log transformed As \nconcentrations (on the same scale as the GM), and iii) the distance to the furthest of the n \nsediment or soil samples.  We used a holdout validation procedure in which a random subset \nof 10% of the sediment or soil sites were removed, using the remaining 90% to estimate GM \n(GMest) values at the sites of the former from the  n (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 20 and 30) \nnearest neighbouring sediment sites on the same PM.  In the case of GM values, we calculated \nthe Mean Squared Deviation (MSD) between the estimated (GM) As at the site and the \nmeasured As at each of the sites in the random 10% subset: \n \n( )2\n1\nest measuredGMn\n1 MSD \u2211\n=\n\u2212=\nn\ni\n     (Equation 1) \n \nWe also calculated MSD\u2019s between the natural log transformed measured soil As and its \nestimate based on the inverse distance weighted value based on the same log transformed  \nstream sediment data. \nNational-scale estimation of soil ABCs: page 10 of 33 \nWe undertook this analysis using soil data for two similar Jurassic ironstone units \n(Northampton Sand Formation (INONS) and the Marlstone Rock (MRB)) and also for the \nUpper Lias (ULI) which is the only other geological unit in the area with substantial lateral \nvariation in arsenic concentration.  For the stream sediment data we undertook the same \nholdout validation for three randomly selected 10% subsets of one PM group characterised by \nsubstantial lateral variations in arsenic concentrations (the Lower Silurian mudstone dominant \nsedimentary rocks of Central Wales (SLLA-MDMIX)).  We used these results to determine an \nappropriate number of samples to calculate GM PHE values for both soil (areas A+B; Figure \n1) and stream sediments (areas C+D). \n \n3.4. Grouping of samples by PM class at different scales (step 5) \nWe wished to use regression to estimate GM soil As concentrations (predictand) for unique \nPM polygons using their local GM sediment concentrations (predictor).  We needed to define \nthe minimum number of soil and sediment samples required for the calculation of a GM value \nbecause if this is based on too few samples, the GM will be imprecise.  We chose to limit the \nregression analysis to include only those PM groups with more than four samples.  \nExploratory analysis showed that when the data were grouped by 10 km squares across central \nEngland there were relatively few (<4) samples over several of the thin, iron-rich PM outcrops \nwhich have elevated PHE concentrations.  In the 10-km grid square illustrated in Figure 5, for \nexample, there are only two sediment samples located on the Marlstone Rock Formation.  \nExcluding these PM groups from the regression analysis could introduce bias.  By grouping at \ndifferent spatial scales (e.g. 1 km2, 25 km2, 100 km2 and greater) we can investigate the \ninfluence of grouping scale on the regression models.  We grouped sediment and soil samples \nby their PM class using three approaches.  First, using all the average 1-km PM polygon \ncentroids, we identified the nearest five sediment samples located on the same PM and \ncalculated GM As.  No value was reported where less than 5 samples are available for a PM.  \nNational-scale estimation of soil ABCs: page 11 of 33 \nThis approach returned 29 416 comparisons of the local sediment (GMsed) and soil (GMsoil) \nGM As concentrations with common PM classes.  Second, by averaging over 25 km2 grid \nsquares the GM values for PM codes derived from the first approach and comparing these to \ncommon PM soil GM As values (n=4025). Third, using a nested-scale approach in which \ngroups of n>4 samples with the same PM code were identified in order of increasing scale  \nwithin: i) 5 km grid squares (25 km2), ii) 10 km grid squares (100 km2), iii) geological map \nsheet (approx 550 km2), and iv) 100 km grid square (1000 km2). If insufficient samples were \npresent at the smaller scale, the next greater scale was used. This resulted in 1188 paired PM \nsoil and stream sediment GM mean As concentrations.  By adopting this latter approach, we \nensure that iron-rich PM groups with elevated PHE concentrations are included in the \nregression analysis. Regression equations were validated by calculating the Mean Squared \nDeviation (MSD) between the measured As at each soil sample site and the estimated GM soil \nAs (GM soilest) calculated from the nearest five sediment values on the same PM (Equation 2): \n \n ( )2\n1\nest measuredsoil GMn\n1 MSD \u2211\n=\n\u2212=\nn\ni\n           (Equation 2) \n \n3.5.  Regression and estimation of confidence intervals (steps 6 and 7) \nWe investigated both linear and polynomial regression relationships; the latter has the form:  \n \n\u03b5\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1 +++= xxy 221       (Equation 3) \n \nin which the sediment GM As concentration for each PM is the explanatory variable ( x ), with \nwhich we wish to predict the equivalent GM PHE for soil ( y ) for the same PM code, with \u03b5  \nrepresenting any unexplained variation. Second order polynomial regression models were \nused after it was found that these were more suited to the transformation of sediment to \nNational-scale estimation of soil ABCs: page 12 of 33 \nequivalent soil concentrations than first order polynomial regression, particularly at high \nconcentrations above the SGV.  Least trimmed squares approaches had the same limitations as \nthe first order polynomial models and so we used the method of least squares.  \nWe assessed the impact of grouping sample locations based on different scales and the \nnumbers of samples in each group for their impact on: i) the regression relationships between \nsoil and stream-sediment PHE concentrations, and ii) holdout validation statistics for \nestimation based on these regression relationships.  The holdout validation statistics used were \nthe Mean Squared Deviation (Equation 4 ) between PM grouped GM soilest  and GMsoil, the \nroot-mean-squared deviation (RMSD; Equation 5), and bias (Equation 6): \n \n( )2\n1\nestGMsoil GMsoiln\n1 \u2211\n=\n\u2212=\nn\ni\nMSD         (Equation 4) \n \n( )\u2211\n=\n\u2212=\nn\ni\nestn\nRMSD\n1\n2GMsoilGMsoil1      (Equation 5) \n \n( ) NBias\nn\nest \/GMsoilGMsoil \n2\u2211 \u2212=      (Equation 6). \n \nIn establishing a regression relationship between GM As concentrations for PM groups \n(explanatory variable, )( ix ) and the proportion of samples exceeding the regulatory threshold \n( iy ; the predictand) of 20 mg kg \n-1, we also considered non-linear relationships of the form:  \n \ni\nx\ni\niy \u03b5\u03c1\u03b2\u03b1    ++=        (Equation 7) \n \nwhere \u03b1 , \u03b2  and \u03c1  are estimated parameters from a curve fitting procedure. \nNational-scale estimation of soil ABCs: page 13 of 33 \nWe calculated the 95% confidence limits around the estimated GM As concentration \nfor each polygon centroid using the mean ( x ) and standard deviation (s) of their log-\ntransformed values.  The confidence limits were calculated on the log transformed scale: \n \nN\nstx\nN\nstx ff +\u2212     and          (Equation 8) \n \nwhere ft  refers to the value for the Students t distribution at the 2.5% significance level for N-\n1 degrees of freedom (2.776) and s is the standard deviation of the nearest 5 soil or sediment \n(log-transformed) values.  We estimated the confidence interval for soil and sediment polygon \ncentroids separately.  The confidence limits were then back-transformed to the measurement \nunits of the original scale.  \nFinally, we used the GM As concentration ( x Y) and the geometric standard deviation \n(s2Y) for PM grouped data to estimate the proportion of samples exceeding the regulatory \nthreshold (z) using the formula for the standard normal distribution: \n \n( )\n\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2212\u2212= 22\n2 \ns2\ns2\n1)s,;( 2\n2\nY\nYxz\nY\nYY exzf \u03c0      (Equation 9). \n \nThe regression model between GM As and the estimated proportion of samples exceeding the \nSGV (%>SGV), derived from PM grouped soil data, was used to estimate the %>SGV for \nindividual 1km-PM polygons for which GMs were calculated from the nearest 5 soil samples \nlocated on the same PM (or the soil equivalent GM As estimated from sediment data as \ndescribed above). \n \nNational-scale estimation of soil ABCs: page 14 of 33 \n3.6. Independent validation for estimation of topsoil As ABCs using sediment data (step 8) \nTo independently validate the conversion of sediment to soil equivalent As ABCs we used \nanalyses by X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometry from a set of 11,335 topsoil samples collected \nby the British Geological Survey between 1972 and 1997.  The samples were collected in \nareas with mineralisation potential, predominantly in Devon and Cornwall, Pembrokeshire, \nthe Lake District and Northumberland (Figure 1).  This is reflected by the elevated values of \nparameters from the statistical distribution of the variate (mg kg-1), mean (78), median (25), \nGM (32), maximum (8647) and strong positive skewness (11.7).  These samples are located \nwithin 414 1km-PM polygons, with a minimum of 4 samples in a 1km-PM polygon. For data \ngrouped into ranges of GM As we then calculated the MSD between (i) GM As for the \nsamples within each 1km-PM polygon and (ii) GM soil As for the 1km-PM polygon estimated \nfrom stream sediment data using the linear regression based on 1188 paired PM soil and \nstream sediment GM mean As concentrations, as explained above.  We also calculated the \nbias for the data as a whole. \n \n4. Results and their interpretation \n \n4.1. Linear quantile transformation \nWe calculated percentiles (p=10, 20,\u2026, 90, 95 and 99) for both the Wolfson and G-BASE \nstream sediment As data for area A+B+C (Table 4) and fitted a linear regression through them \nusing least squares (Figure 6).  The regression accounted for 99.2 % of the variance, with an \nintercept (\u03b1) of -3.1 and slope (\u03b2) of 1.42 based on the eleven paired percentiles. Weighted \nlinear regression models, as used by Daneshfar and Cameron (1998), produce almost identical \nresults over the same percentile range.  For comparison we also plotted the GM As \nconcentrations for PM groups with greater than eight samples for each of the datasets.  A \nlinear regression of these points (not shown) was very similar to that for the percentiles. \nNational-scale estimation of soil ABCs: page 15 of 33 \nAll the paired quantiles and the majority of the PM GMs plot above the 1:1 line \nindicating that in general As concentrations are higher in the finer (<150\u03bcm) G-BASE \nsediments than the slightly coarser (<177\u03bcm) Wolfson samples.  This conforms with \ngeochemical theory in which some trace elements are enriched in finer-grained samples \n(Plant, 1971), due to their associations with iron and manganese oxy-hydroxides.  The \nregression equation described above for areas A+B+C was then applied to the Wolfson \nsediment data in area D to create a continuous map of As in stream sediment for areas C+D.  \nThese data were then converted to soil equivalent concentrations using the methods that \nfollow. \n \n4.2. Holdout validation: optimum number of samples for estimating GM \nThe MSD is relatively constant when the number of neighbouring soil samples used to \ncalculate GM exceeds 4 for those PMs which exhibit relatively little lateral variation in As \nwhereas the variation in MSD with \u2018n\u2019 is strongest for those PMs which exhibit marked lateral \nvariation in GM As (e.g. Northampton Sand Formation (INONS) and the Marlstone Rock \nFormation (MRB) ironstone units). In order to increase the reliability of the MSD tests, soil \ndata for the two similar Jurassic ironstone units (INONS and MRB) were grouped together to \nproduce a subgroup of 320 soil samples. The only other PM in the area with substantial lateral \nvariation in arsenic is the Upper Lias (ULI, n = 315 soil samples). Average results of three \nholdout validation calculations for these two groups of soils are presented in Figure 7a. In \ngeneral, the differences (MSD) between estimated and actual GM As values decrease as the \nnumber of neighbouring samples used to calculated the GM increases from one to five.  The \noptimum number of samples (smallest MSD) for estimating GM soil arsenic for 1km-PM \npolygons is between 5 and 9. \nThe results for three sets of holdout validation for sediments from the SLLA-MDMIX \n(Silurian Llandovery mudstone-dominant sedimentary rocks of Central Wales with no \nNational-scale estimation of soil ABCs: page 16 of 33 \nsuperficial cover) PM are presented in Figure 7b.  In subset 1, there is a gradual decrease of \nMSD as the n samples used to determine the GM increases from 1 to 7 and then an increase in \nMSD from 7 to 25.  For subsets 2 and 3, there is little change in MSD when the number of \nsamples is 5 or more whilst the MSD is higher when n = 1 or 2.  Selecting the optimum \nnumber of samples is a balance between the number which gives the smallest MSD whilst \nensuring that significant local variations in arsenic concentrations are diminished by using too \nmany samples.  The optimum number of samples for estimating arsenic for the centroids of \n1km-parent material polygons is between 4 and 7 for sediments, so we decided to calculate \nGMs from the 5 nearest samples for both sediments and soils.  \n \n4.3. Linear regression, holdout validation and mapping soil As \nThe second order polynomial model (Equation 3) fitted to the three groups of GMsoil and \nGMsoilest data are shown in Figure 8a-c and the regression coefficients in Table 5.  The \nholdout validation statistics are shown in Table 6.  The regression based on grouping at a \nrange of scales (Figure 8c) returns higher estimates of GM soil As in the upper range (>3 log \nnormal transformed As ~ 20 mg kg-1) because there are more As enriched PM types with n>4 \nsamples included, reflected in the regression equation plotting closer to the 1:1 line than those \nin Figures 8a and 8b.  The standard error of the estimate for the nested-scale for grouping PM \ngroups was also smaller than for grouping using the two other scales (Table 5). \nThe smallest MSD (Equation 2) values at the lower As concentrations (0 - 20 mg kg-1) \nwere those for regressions based on the 1-km polygons and 5-km averaging of 1-km polygons \n(Figures 8a-b), with slightly higher values for the regression derived from the nested-scale \napproach.  However, the MSD values are significantly smaller above 20 mg kg-1 As for the \nregression in which the nested approach was used based on PM groups across four different \nscales (Table 6).  Given the importance of accurately estimating GM As values in soil with \nelevated ABCs of trace elements, we selected the nested-scale approach and its regression \nNational-scale estimation of soil ABCs: page 17 of 33 \nequation (Fig 8c) for the conversion of PM grouped sediment to soil equivalent As \nconcentrations.  The MSD and RMSD (Equation 5) values for classes with increasing \ndistances for GM versus an IDW interpolation of As concentrations of the nearest five \nsediment samples (Table 7) show that: i) the former has smaller errors, ii) that the variation in \nthese errors is smaller, and iii) estimation errors increase with maximum distance to the \nfurthest sample.  Therefore we chose to base the estimation of soil equivalent As on the GM of \nthe nearest five sediment samples for common 1-km PM polygons rather than the IDW \nestimate. \nThe final map of mineral topsoil As ABCs was produced by combining the GM As \nconcentrations for polygons in areas A+B (Figure 1) using the deeper soil G-BASE data and \nthe topsoil equivalent estimates for GM As resulting from application of steps 1-6 (Figure 3) \nto the stream sediment data for areas C+D (Figure 1).  The map of topsoil estimated ABCs \n(Figure 9) shows that As background concentrations are likely to exceed the regulatory \nthreshold over 16% of E&W.  When we include those areas that are equal to the regulatory \nthreshold the proportion increases significantly to 25%.  The fine resolution of the soil \nequivalent concentrations shown is due to the in excess of 1.9 million individual 1km-PM \npolygons across E&W. The boundaries between the categories of soil concentrations are \nsharp, reflecting the delineations of the PM polygons.  This is a noticeable difference to those \nmaps based on interpolation of data at discrete sampling locations.  The largest areas with the \nhighest concentrations (>30 mg kg-1) occur in the English Lake District, western Wales and \nsouth-west England.  No estimates can be made for ABCs in the greater London area because \nno stream sediment or soil data are available to date. \nThe estimated 95% confidence intervals for each of the concentration classes shown on \nFigure 9 are presented in Table 8; confidence intervals are presented for ABCs estimated from \nboth soil and sediment values.  The confidence intervals become wider as the GM As ABC \nincreases.  Also, the confidence intervals for PM polygons based on sediment values are \nNational-scale estimation of soil ABCs: page 18 of 33 \ngreater than those for each of the soil concentration ranges.  Hence, the greatest uncertainties \nfor ABCs shown in Figure 9 are for those areas of Wales, north-west England and south-west \nEngland where the large estimated ABC As values (>30 mg kg-1) are based on stream \nsediment data. \n \n4.4. Independent validation \nThe MSD and bias values calculated from the independent validation dataset are shown in \nTable 6.  The validation data were sited over mineralised areas of E&W where without prior \ninformation it would be difficult to estimate soil As ABCs. This is reflected in the MSD \nvalues, which are somewhat larger (0.25-2.08) than those for the holdout validation based on \nthe nested-scale regression (0.1-1.79).  The bias of the estimates is also somewhat larger; 0.19 \nfor the independent validation compared to 0.03 after application of the nested-scale \nregression.  However, these independent validation data demonstrate the methodology is \nsufficiently robust to be used for the estimation of ABCs across the landscape of E&W for \nthose elements which have similar geological and geochemical controls to As. The \nmethodology has not been assessed for elements that dominantly occur in resistate minerals, \nsuch as Zr, Sn, or W, especially in areas of strong relief.   \n \n4.5. Probability of exceeding the As regulatory threshold \nThe least squares fit of the non-linear regression relationship between GM As and the \nproportion of samples in each PM group exceeding 20 mg kg-1, fitted using the CURVEFIT \ndirective in Genstat (Payne, 2002) is plotted in Figure 10.  The coefficients from Equation 7 \nwere: \u03b1  (99.7), \u03b2 (-171.9) and \u03c1 (0.944) with the regression capturing 92.3% of the variance, \nwith a standard error of 6.26.  So using the GM As concentration for any soil equivalent PM \npolygon and the normal distribution (Equation 7) we can apply this regression equation to \nNational-scale estimation of soil ABCs: page 19 of 33 \nestimate the proportion of samples which are likely to exceed the regulatory threshold of 20 \nmg kg-1. \n \n5. Discussion \nWe have presented and applied a methodology which employs stream sediment values to \nestimate ABCs of As in mineral topsoil across E&W, based on common PM groups.  Our \nanalysis suggests that 16% of the landscape of E&W has As ABCs exceeding the threshold \n(i.e. 20 mg kg-1) of the first tier of the risk assessment adopted by regulatory authorities for \nresidential land use.  Although topsoil As ABCs above this threshold does not in itself imply a \nsignificant health risk, it does show that more frequent and complex contaminated-ground risk \nassessments will likely be needed for much of the landscape of E&W.  These spatially \nreferenced data can be used to assess the probability that the SGV will be exceeded at a \nparticular site, and whether elevated concentrations of arsenic observed in site investigations \nmay be attributable to geogenic sources or whether it is possible that the observed \nconcentrations may have been influenced by anthropogenic factors.  From our preliminary \nanalysis (Figure 3), we believe this approach could be extended to include Cr and Ni.  The \nlatter may be of particular significance because it exhibits geogenically elevated \nconcentrations (McGrath and Loveland, 1992), exceeding the SGV of 50 mg kg-1 (DEFRA & \nEA, 2002b) across parts of E&W. \nWhether this methodology could be applied more widely depends on a number of \nfactors, but principally on the correlations between PHEs in soil and stream sediments across \nlarge areas.  It will be most applicable where soils are relatively young, such as the recently \nglaciated areas of northern Europe, and cognate landscapes.  Clearly there is a need for \nexisting, HR stream sediment geochemical data; this is often available from mineral \nexploration studies.  For example, the National Uranium Resource Evaluation Programme in \nthe USA has around 400,000 stream sediment samples (Bolivar, 1980), compared with \nNational-scale estimation of soil ABCs: page 20 of 33 \ngeochemistry for only 1323 soil samples available nationally (Boerngen and Shacklette, \n1981). \nWe recognise there may be theoretical objections to our approach.  First, stream \nsediments represent the weathered material transported from an entire catchment which may \ncomprise a number of geological sources with differing geochemical compositions.  When \neroded and transported along the stream network, the geochemical composition of mixed \nprovenance sediment may be quite different from the chemistry of the underlying geological \nsubstrate at any particular point in the stream, and also the soils derived from its PM.  Second, \nin-stream geochemical processes tend to increase the concentrations of PHEs due to their \nstrong adsorption to, or co-precipitation with, iron and manganese oxides which commonly \ncoat stream sediments (Nichol et al., 1967), leading to potentially significant bias.  This may \nbe greatest in upland areas of E&W, where secondary precipitation may be enhanced in acidic \nstreams draining organic rich, peat soils.  The potential for overestimation of ABCs in soil \nbased on stream sediment in these environments requires further investigation especially with \nrespect to the concentration of chemical elements and mineral species in the fluvial \nenvironment (Garrett et al., 2005). \nIt may also be possible to enhance our methodology.  For example, the use of weighted \nlinear regression may improve the transformation of sediment to soil equivalent \nconcentrations, and this could be tested using holdout validation.  Second, we could explore \nthe scale-dependent correlation of sediment and soil concentrations using a geostatistical \napproach.  This might indicate that different scales of generalization may be more appropriate \nthan the parent material unit.  As the variables are not collocated, it would be necessary to use \nthe pseudo cross-variogram (Myers, 1991).  To these we could fit coregionalization models to \ncompute correlations between the mean values of the variables within blocks of different size \n(the inter-block correlation; (Pringle and Lark, 2007)).  This could be used to assess whether \nthere are advantages in using grouping at scales different to those we have used here. \nNational-scale estimation of soil ABCs: page 21 of 33 \n \n6.
