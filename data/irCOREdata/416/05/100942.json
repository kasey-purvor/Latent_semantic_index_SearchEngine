INTRODUCTION\nThere has been much research recently in the field of\nIII-nitride semiconductors, and InGaN quantum wells \u0001QWs\u0002\nin particular, because of their wide band gap, which means\nthey can emit blue or violet light. Short-wavelength lasers\nallow a high density of information to be stored on a digital\nversatile disk \u0001DVD\u0002 and InGaN QW light-emitting diodes\n\u0001LEDs\u0002 can be used to excite a mixture of phosphors, pro-\nducing white light.1\nThe wavelength of the light emitted from a III-nitride\nQW depends not only on the band gap but also on the large\ninternal electric field due to piezoelectric \u0001PZ\u0002 and spontane-\nous polarization.2 The PZ field arises from strain due to the\nlattice mismatch between the InxGa1\u2212xN well and the GaN\nbarriers \u0001about 2% for x=0.2\u0002 and causes redshift in the op-\ntical transition energy.3 Spontaneous polarization \u0001SP\u0002 is a\nfeature of the III-nitride wurtzite crystal even when there is\nno strain present. In a typical InGaN\/GaN device, SP is an\norder of magnitude smaller than PZ polarization. When a\nreverse bias is applied, a blueshift is seen due to the partial\ncancellation of the internal field.4\u20138 By measuring the blue-\nshift as a function of applied field it is possible to infer the\nsize of the internal field.\nThe existence of the converse PZ effect \u0001whereby an\nelectric field gives rise to stress\u0002 means that we should use\ncoupled equations to calculate the strain and internal field, or\nat least explore whether electromechanical coupling makes a\nsignificant difference to the result. Pan and Tonon9 and Pan10\nhave developed a coupled model for quantum dots but, un-\na\u0002Electronic mail: u.christmas@surrey.ac.uk\n0021-8979\/2005\/98\u00027\u0001\/073522\/12\/$22.50 98, 07352\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject tlike the present work, it does not incorporate SP. Bernardini\nand Fiorentini2 explored the application of periodic boundary\nconditions to multiple quantum wells; in this paper we go\nfurther and apply periodic boundary conditions to the\ncoupled model.\nThere is much uncertainty11 in the values of the material\nparameters used to describe the internal field of GaN and\nInN, namely, the PZ tensor, the elastic stiffness tensor Cijkl,\nand SP. This is partly because the study of III-nitrides is in its\ninfancy, but also because every sample has different defects\nand because it is difficult to grow large enough crystals. Then\nthere is the separate problem of estimating the corresponding\nproperties of the alloy.\nThe uncertainty in the material parameters gives rise to\nuncertainty in the optical transition energy. Experiments on\nthe optical properties of InGaN\/GaN QWs have been carried\nout by Takeuchi et al.,4 Lai et al.,6 Jho et al.,7 Waltereit\net al.,12 Feng et al.,13 Dhar et al.,14 Wang et al.,15 and others;\ntheoretical studies have been done by Oriato and Walker,16\nand Xiao and Kim.17 The results vary widely, even for simi-\nlar well widths and In fractions. The motivation for the\npresent work is to explore the reasons for these variations.\nAnother problem is to ascertain the properties of a par-\nticular device. For example, the In fraction x, which is usu-\nally estimated indirectly, is a strong function of the growth\ntemperature. At the end of the growth of a well, the tempera-\nture is often increased in order to grow the GaN barrier and\nthis may cause loss or redistribution of In. In this paper we\ninvestigate the effect on the optical transition energy of an In\ngradient along the growth axis.\nIn short, this paper explores some of the uncertainties\ncontributing to the calculation of the internal field \u0001and con-\n\u00a9 2005 American Institute of Physics2-1\no AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\n073522-2 Christmas, Andreev, and Faux J.

II A presenting our analytic solution to the\nelectromechanically coupled equations for strain and internal\nfield in a QW, and Sec. II B the application of this coupling\nto the periodic boundary conditions appropriate for multiple\nquantum wells \u0001MQWs\u0002. Section II C outlines our model for\ncalculating electronic structure and, in Sec. II D, we point\nout two different routes for calculating the PZ tensor ele-\nments eijk of an alloy by interpolation. Section III contains\nresults. In Sec. III A we show that electromechanical cou-\npling produces an internal field 2% lower than that predicted\nby uncoupled equations. Section III B shows that the two\nalternative routes for calculating the PZ constants of InGaN\nproduce internal fields that differ by around 10% and inves-\ntigates which route agrees better with experimental results.\nIn Sec. III D we explore the effect of the uncertainties in the\nvalues of Cijkl and of the PZ tensor on the calculation of\ninternal field and optical properties; we find that uncertain-\nties in the PZ constants eij give rise to an uncertainty of the\norder of \u00b120% in internal field, \u00b15% in the ground-state\nelectronic transition energy Etr,0 at zero bias and \u00b130% in\nblueshift \u0001which is the difference between the ground-state\ntransition energy at zero bias and the maximum ground-state\ntransition energy, when the applied field is equal and oppo-\nsite to the internal field\u0002. In Sec. III E we compare our cal-\nculations of internal field, Etr and blueshift with the pub-\nlished results; we show that the PZ constants calculated by\nShimada et al.18 give the best correspondence with experi-\nmental results, and we discuss some of the reasons for the\nwide variation in experimental and theoretical results. In Sec.\nIII F we investigate the effect of a smooth In gradient in the\ngrowth direction and show that it does not have a significant\neffect on the optical transition energy. In Sec. IV we draw\nour conclusions.\nII. THEORY\nA. Quantum wells\nWe now present our fully coupled equations for internal\nelectric field and strain in the growth direction in a wurtzite\nQW or MQW system in the \u00010001\u0002 orientation. \u201cCoupled\u201d\nmeans that the two-way piezoelectric interaction between\nstrain and electric field is taken into account. Spontaneous\npolarization is also incorporated \u0001Pan and Tonon9 and Pan10\nmodels incorporate electromechanical coupling but do not\nincorporate SP\u0002.\nStress is given by\n\u0001i = Cij\u0002 j \u2212 Fkeki \u00011\u0002\nwhere we use the Voigt notation \u0001i=1. . .6 and j=1. . .6\u0002, in\nwhich the first three elements of \u0001 \u0001stress\u0002 and \u0002 \u0001strain\u0002\ndenote the principal stresses \u0001strains\u0002 and the last three de-\nnote the shear elements; Cij are the elastic stiffnesses and the\neki are the PZ constants. Fk is the kth component of the\ninternal electric field \u0001k=1. . .3\u0002 and the second term repre-\nsents the converse PZ effect, whereby an electric field modi-\nfies the stress field. The Einstein convention is used, in which\nrepeated indices imply summation.\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

It is assumed that\nthe barrier is fully relaxed \u0001there is normally a lattice mis-\nmatch between the barrier and the sapphire substrate on\nwhich it is grown, but the strain is relaxed by means of\ndislocations\u0002.\nSubstituting Eqs. \u00012\u0002\u2013\u00014\u0002 into Eq. \u00011\u0002, we have\n\u00013 = 0 = 2C13\u00020 + C33\u00023 \u2212 e33F3. \u00016\u0002\nWe then take the well-known electrostatic equation,\nDm = \u0003mkFk + Pm, \u00017\u0002\nwhere D is the electrostatic displacement, \u0003mk is the dielec-\ntric tensor, which is diagonal, and P is the polarization.

Appl. Phys. 98, 073522 \u00022005\u0001We neglect exciton binding energies because they are\ntypically less than 25 meV.20,21 We have assumed that the\nfield due to doped regions is negligible. This is because at\nroom temperature only about 1% of acceptors are ionized,\ndue to the strong binding energy between the Mg dopant and\nGaN. Thus in a typical device the p-n field would be some\nthree orders of magnitude smaller than the PZ field.\nAn internal field causes electrons and holes to congre-\ngate at opposite boundaries of the well, setting up their own\nopposing field, which becomes significant if the carrier den-\nsity is high. We have chosen to ignore this effect and con-\ncentrate on the pure PZ\/SP field, so that in analyzing our\nresults there is no confusion between various competing ef-\nfects. Thus we operate in a low carrier density regime, less\nthan 1011 cm\u22122, which would produce a field of the order of\n10\u22122 MV cm\u22121, at least 100 times smaller than the PZ field\nand therefore negligible.\nWe use the material parameters set out in Table I.\nD.

In our\ncalculations we use eij because strain is simpler to calculate\nthan stress. Since uncertainty surrounds the values of both dik\nand Ckj, the uncertainty of eij \u0001unless is it measured directly\u0002\nis compounded. However, no direct literature values of eij for\nInN appear to be available, so we must rely on the dij calcu-\nlated by Bernardini and Fiorentini \u0001Ref. 23\u0002 and, for GaN,\nthe dij is more often reported23\u201326 than the eij.18,27\nThe equation for interpolation between material proper-\nties of GaN and InN is28\nY\u0001InxGa1\u2212xN\u0002 = xY\u0001InN\u0002 + \u00011 \u2212 x\u0002Y\u0001GaN\u0002 \u2212 bx\u00011 \u2212 x\u0002 ,\n\u000131\u0002\nwhere Y is any material property and b is a bowing param-\neter, which is usually taken to be zero in the case of the PZ\nand elastic properties, but not in the case of the bandgap28\nand SP.29\nTo estimate the eij of InGaN, there are two possible\nroutes.

In the second example we use Eq. \u000118\u0002 in\nthe uncoupled case and Eq. \u000124\u0002 in the coupled case. In both\ndevices coupling reduces the internal field by 2% and, as one\nwould expect, it reduces the blueshift \u0001the difference be-\ntween the ground-state transition energy at zero bias and the\nmaximum ground-state transition energy, when the applied\nfield cancels the internal field\u0002 by a comparable amount. Etr,0,\nthe transition energy at zero bias, increases \u0001by about 1%\u0002\nbecause the internal field is reduced.\nThe consequence of Eq. \u000125\u0002 is that there is a small\npositive strain in the growth direction in the barrier, of the\norder of 2\t10\u22124, two orders of magnitude smaller than that\nin the well. Using Eq. \u000125\u0002 instead of Eq. \u000115\u0002 reduces the\nstrain in the growth direction in the well by about 6%. The\neffect is to increase the ground-state transition energy by\n0.2% and the blueshift by 1%. This is a small secondary\neffect and we neglect it in all calculations that follow, using\ninstead Eq. \u000115\u0002 and assuming the barrier to be fully relaxed.\nB. e-first or e-last?\nThe e-first and e-last routes described in Sec. II D do not\nproduce the same results, as Figs. 2\u20135 show. Here we have\nused as an example the device depicted in Fig. 1. For an In\nfraction of 0.2, using e-last instead of e-first increases the\ninternal field by 9%, reduces Etr,0 by about 2% and increases\nthe blueshift \bEtr \u0001the difference between the transition en-\nergy at zero bias and the maximum transition energy, when\nthe applied field is equal and opposite to the internal field\u0002 by\n10%\u201315%.\nTo test the accuracy of the e-first and e-last routes, we\nsimulated various devices in literature.

Our e-first values\nof F and \bEtr correspond more closely with literature values\nthan do our e-last results.\nWhich route is more logical? e-last involves the product\nof two linearly interpolated quantities \u0001dij and Ckl\u0002 and is\ntherefore quadratic in x. This is surprising for what is osten-\nsibly a linear interpolation approach. With e-first, eij is a\nlinear function of x, as we would expect. e-first gives results\nwhich are closer to the experimental results. There is evi-\ndence that the In in InGaN tends to form lumps or dots,30\nwhich means that it is sensible to calculate the properties of\nthe binaries so far as possible before combining them. This\nwould favor using e-first.\nAltogether, e-first is preferable and we use it henceforth.\nHowever, we have not found any discussion of the alterna-\ntive routes in literature.\nC.

Redistribution subject tD. Effect of uncertainty in stiffness and PZ constants\non internal field and optical properties\nWe now consider the most important material parameters\nthat influence the internal field, namely, the elastic stiffness\nand the PZ constants, and examine their effect on the internal\nfield, and thus on the optical properties, of an\nIn0.2Ga0.8N\/GaN MQW.\nThere is a wide range of published values for the elastic\nstiffness and PZ tensor elements of GaN and InN. Some\nexamples are given in Table IV. The uncertainty surrounding\nthe measurement of the PZ constants is illustrated by the\nresults of Guy et al.,31 who report two different values of\nd33\u2014varying by 50%\u2014from apparently identical samples of\nInN. A further difficulty is that the so-called PZ constants are\nactually strain-dependent.32,33\nTable IV gives \u0001in bold type\u0002 the values of eij calculated\nfrom the published values of dij by using Eq. \u000130\u0002 with Vur-\ngaftman and Meyer Cij.11 To illustrate the effect on eij of the\nuncertainty in Cij, Table IV also presents extreme values of\neij calculated from the highest and lowest values of Cij\n\u0001marked h and l in the table\u0002. The error bars on eij are of the\norder of 50% \u0001as much as 75% in the case of the lower limit\nof the e33 of GaN\u0002.\nSuch uncertainty in the input parameters is bound to give\nrise to uncertainty in the optical properties. Cij affects the\ninternal field in two separate ways: through the calculation of\neij \u0003Eq. \u000130\u0002\u0004 and through the calculation of strain \u0003Eq. \u000113\u0002\u0004.\nWe now take some sample high and low values \u0001for GaN\u0002 of\neach parameter in turn \u0001marked h and l in Table IV\u0002 and\ninvestigate the effect on F, Etr,0, and \bEtr of perturbing the\ninput value \u0001we do not consider uncertainties in InN param-\neters, since InN typically only forms 20% of the alloy, so\nGaN properties dominate\u0002.\nOnce again we use as an example the device depicted in\nFig. 1, with coupled periodic boundary conditions. As can be\nseen from Table V, uncertainties in eij give rise to a deviation\nof up to +26% or \u221223% in the internal field and of as much\nas +38% or \u221232% in blueshift. The direct effect of uncer-\ntainty in Cij on the results is smaller, giving rise to an varia-\ntion of the order of \u00b110% or less. The effect of uncertainties\nin eij on transition energy is smaller still, producing an un-\ncertainty of no more than about \u00b15%, while the effect of Cij\non electronic transition energy is minimal \u0001less than 1%\u0002.\nIn summary, uncertainties in the values of eij \u0001due in part\nto uncertainties in the values of Cij\u0002 cause significant uncer-\ntainties in the optical properties of InGaN\/GaN QWs. These\nare large compared to the differences between the electrome-\nchanically coupled and uncoupled models. In the light of\nthis, the use of an electromechanically coupled model may\nnot be warranted for this system.\nE. Internal field, Etr,0, and blueshift\nWe used our model to simulate a range of InGaN\/GaN\ndevices in the literature with various well widths and In frac-\ntions and we compared the optical properties we calculated\nwith those reported.

Oriato and Walker16 use a coupled\nPoisson-Schr\u00f6dinger approach, and Xiao and Kim17 use the\nRashba-Sheka-Pikus Hamiltonian. Table III sets out our cal-\nculated internal field, Etr,0, and blueshift together with the\ncorresponding values in the literature. Present calculations\nare shown in bold type and literature values in ordinary type.\nEtr,0 depends not only on In fraction and well width but also\non the barrier width and whether the device is a MQW;\nhence our simulations of devices which have the same xIn\nand Lw \u0001Refs. 4 and 13\u0002 do not necessarily produce the same\nresults.\nWhere internal field is reported in the experimental\nwork, the field is deduced from Etr \u0001as a function of applied\nbias in the case of Takeuchi et al.,4 Lai et al.,6 and Jho et al.,7\nand as a function of well width in the case of Hangleiter\net al.34\u0002. Our internal fields and blueshifts tend to be on the\nhigh side \u0001although the match with another theory paper\n\u0001Xiao and Kim17\u0002 is reasonably good\u0002. This may be partly\ndue to screening, which is not taken into account in our\nmodel. Or it may be that the PZ constants we use are too\nhigh.

Appl. Phys. 98, 073522 \u00022005\u0001We end this subsection by reflecting on some of the is-\nsues which may give rise to the variation we have seen be-\ntween the optical properties of outwardly similar InGaN de-\nvices, and between theory and experiment. The properties of\na device depend greatly on growth conditions,37,38 including\nreactor design, temperature, growth pressure, carrier gas, and\nflow rates. They depend also on the choice of substrate and\non the thickness of the buffer layer. Interface roughness, the\ndensity of threading dislocations,39 and that of In clusters,30\nalso affect the optical properties. Discrepancies between\ntheory and experiment arise partly from the difficulty of\ngrowing samples of reasonable quality and sufficient size for\nan accurate measurement of the PZ constants, so it may be\nthat ab initio calculations such as Shimada et al.18 are cur-\nrently more reliable \u0001ab initio methods can accurately repro-\nduce experimental values of PZ constants for materials such\nFIG. 6.

Another difficulty in simulating experimental re-\nsults is that the dependence of eij on In fraction is usually\nassumed to be linear, but there is evidence that it is actually\nquadratic.22 The strain dependence of eij \u0001Refs. 32 and 33\u0002 is\nan additional complication which is not yet well understood.\nThe field of III nitrides is a young one, where the material\nproperties are not yet fully researched.\nF. Effect of In gradient on Etr,0 and blueshift\nThe In content may not be constant across a well, partly\nbecause the higher temperature needed to grow the second\nGaN barrier may cause some of the In to boil off. We now\ninvestigate how an In gradient in the growth direction affects\nthe optical properties. We take four arbitrary profiles, con-\nstant, linear, quadratic, and quartic, all with the same average\nIn content, and one quadratic profile with a different average\nIn content, as shown in Fig. 10. For ease of computation, we\nvaried the In fraction in 20 discrete steps across the well,\nrather than in a continuous manner.\nFigure 11 shows the band profiles corresponding to the\nfirst four In profiles. While the well bottom becomes more\nand more curved as the degree of the polynomial increases,\nthis is a mere detail compared to the feature which dominates\nall the scenarios: the slope in the well due to the PZ field.\nThus the ground-state electron and hole energies and the\ntransition energies do not differ significantly between differ-\nent profiles.\nFigure 12 shows the ground-state transition energy as a\nfunction of applied bias, for each of the In profiles pictured.\nThe result is similar for all the profiles having the same av-\nerage In content; the only one that is noticeably different is\nthe quadratic profile with the same limits as the linear profile,\nbut a smaller average In content. This shows that, while the\ntotal In content is an important factor affecting the optical\nproperties, the manner in which it is distributed along the\ngrowth axis is not important if the distribution is smooth \u0001we\nare not discussing In segregation here; the spontaneous for-\nFIG. 7.

CONCLUSIONS\nWe have presented electromechanically coupled analytic\nexpressions for the strain and internal field in a quantum\nwell, incorporating spontaneous polarization. We have ex-\ntended this to incorporate periodic boundary conditions in\nmultiple quantum wells. We find that electromechanical cou-\npling, when used instead of the uncoupled model, reduces\nthe internal field in In0.2Ga0.8N\/GaN QWs by 2%. This is\nsmall compared to the errors due to uncertainties in the val-\nues of stiffness and PZ constants. We have pointed out two\ndifferent interpolation routes for calculating the PZ tensor\nelements eij of an alloy from the dij of the binaries. We favor\nthe \u201ce-first\u201d method, which gives a 10% lower internal field\nthan \u201ce-last.\u201d Using an effective-mass model, we have inves-\ntigated the effect of the uncertainty in the PZ and elastic\nconstants on the internal field and ground-state optical tran-\nsition in an InGaN\/GaN quantum well, and found that the\nrange of published values gives rise to an uncertainty in the\ninternal field of more than \u00b120%, an uncertainty in blueshift\ndue to applied field of more than \u00b130%, and in ground-state\ntransition energy of less than \u00b16%.
