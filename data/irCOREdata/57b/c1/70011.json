Extending these rarer studies, we argue that changes in the \nscientific articulation of ageing processes and death over a longer historical period than has been considered \nhitherto offer important insights into the ontology of the emergent politics of \u201elife itself\u201f. \n \nKeywords: Ageing; death; anatomo-politics; \u201elife itself\u201f. \n \n  \n14 October 2008: 1 \nIntroduction \nDrawing on the work of Michel Foucault, but also significantly departing from Foucault\u201fs own understanding \nof bio-political governmentality, Paul Rabinow (1996), Nikolas Rose (2001) and others suggest very \npersuasively that we are currently witnessing an epochal transformation in the organisation of embodied life. \nWe should now speak of the advent of a politics of \u201elife itself\u201f insofar as the individual of the nineteenth \ncentury bio-political imaginary, a human body whose biological constitution was irremediably fixed at birth, \nis giving way to an understanding of the human body as an assembly of bio-molecular components that can \nbe freely recombined so as to maximise the resultant unit\u201fs cultural, social and political productivity. What is \nunclear, however, is what might be happening to death.  \n \nIf Rabinow and Rose can be said to articulate and detail Gilles Deleuze\u201fs claim that the emerging \ngovernmental order is one in which the modern calculus of finitude gives way to unlimited recombination of \na finite number of components, it is also important to note that death, the seemingly inescapable moment in \nwhich all vital activities cease, underpins the modern concern about finitude (Deleuze, 1988: 126-9). It then \nseems crucially important to ask what the notion of unlimited recombination entails in regard to this critical \nmoment. Stephen Katz and Barbara Marshall (2003) have discussed at length how, within so-called \n\u201eadvanced societies\u201f, the process of ageing, which in many ways has been symbolically construed as \nprefiguring death, is today being reconfigured so as to undermine the classical, cultural partitioning of the \nlife cycle into birth, sex and death. This reconfiguration sets the stage for what the publicly acclaimed, \nleading bio-gerontologist Thomas Kirkwood (2001) calls the coming \u201eend of age\u201f. Furthermore, others point \nto a new social configuration whereby the avoidance of ageing and the pursuit of immortality are becoming \nnormatively binding (Powell & Biggs, 2004; Vincent, 2006; Mykytyn, 2006a; 2006b). These socio-cultural \nshifts are clearly related to both the increasing organisation of health care around the mode of consumption \nand a re-orientation of biomedical research and practice towards the bio-molecular characterisation \npathological processes associated with ageing, aiming to offer thereby new, preventative modes of \nintervention in these processes (see Petersen, 1997). On the other hand, none of these accounts attends to the \nreconfiguration of death as a specifically biological phenomenon. Providing a detailed account of what \nFoucault would call the anatomo-political reconfiguration of death sustaining the prospective \u201eend of age\u201f, an \naccount comparable to that which Foucault advanced in The Birth of the Clinic (1964), would seem crucially \nimportant, however. As Rabinow (1999) himself has noted, the new medical technologies which are often \nassociated with the emerging politics of \u201elife itself\u201f raise weighty ontological questions, but, in turning to a \nvery modern definition of \u201enominalism\u201f to lay such questions to rest (see Dupr\u00e9, 1993), the new bio-political \n  \n14 October 2008: 2 \norder is reduced to no more than an ideological construct imposed upon a historically unchanging material \nsubstratum (see Canguilhem, 1977; Bachelard, 1984). This conceptual difficulty cannot be any more evident \nthan in those cases where the analysis of the new medical technologies touches on death, supposedly the one \nphenomenon which is refractory to all negotiation and which, ever since Martin Heidegger, is to be \nunderstood as the very bedrock of human consciousness (see Lock, 2002: 200-7). Melinda Cooper has \nbegun, however, to outline the contours of a new understanding of life and death by focussing on recent \ndevelopments within the much heralded field of stem-cell technology, developments which seem to offer the \nprospect of endlessly regenerating the otherwise inevitably declining capacities of the human body, and she is \ndoing so with an eye to the ontological foundations of the emerging bio-political order (see Cooper, 2002; \n2006). This said, Cooper also seems to have been swept up by the promissory economy of \u201eregenerative \nmedicine\u201f, so that it seems worth examining instead the ways in which leading figures in the field of bio-\ngerontology, including the abovementioned Kirkwood, have repeatedly mounted concerted efforts to call into \nquestion the much bandied notion that the dramatic extension of human life-span, if not the achievement of \nhuman immortality, is today within reach of the biomedical sciences (see Vincent, 2003; also Moreira & \nPalladino, 2005). While one might ask quite legitimately whether these objections are no more than a wholly \npredictable, conservative response to the prospect of losing the very field of problematisation that defines the \ndiscipline of bio-gerontology, understood here as the epistemic field simultaneously engaged in the bio-\nmolecular and bio-demographic characterisation of pathological processes associated with ageing, one could \nalso situate these objections within a longer history of scientific reflections on death, exploring some crucially \nimportant tensions between the practices of evolutionary explanation and techno-scientific intervention. In \nthis paper we offer therefore a close reading of those theories of ageing and death which are associated \nprimarily with Kirkwood, Leonard Hayflick and Alex Comfort.  \n \nWe focus on Kirkwood, Hayflick and Comfort not simply because their ideas, as well as related analytical \npractices and professional affiliations, fully capture the range of the more sceptical perspectives on the \nplasticity of ageing and death which are currently pursued within the field of bio-gerontology, and which are \nthe main focus of socio-cultural studies of the contemporary reconfiguration of old age. Neither do we focus \non these three figures simply because Comfort can be viewed as the founder of bio-gerontology as a novel, \ndistinct and coherent field of intellectual inquiry, Hayflick as he who developed the material and institutional \nwherewithal for the expansion of the enterprise, and Kirkwood as he who has reframed the evolutionary \nconsiderations first articulated by Comfort to rebuild the expansive intellectual, material and institutional \nnetwork encompassed by contemporary bio-gerontology. To us, Kirkwood, Comfort and Hayflick are instead \n  \n14 October 2008: 3 \nespecially important figures because they offer very different readings of one and the same historical text, \nnamely August Weismann\u201fs speculative reflections on the biological evolution of ageing and death, which \nwere first articulated in The Duration of Life (1881) and Life and Death (1883).  We approach these readings \nnot as post-hoc reconstructions to legitimate otherwise autonomous scientific developments, but as central to \nthe transformation of bio-gerontology and its emergence in the public sphere during the last quarter of the \n20th  century.  Scientists\u201f stories, as one of us has put it, \u201e[are] not only a topic in the practical \naccomplishment of the history and social studies of science, technology and medicine, but also in the \naccomplishment of facts, artifacts, representations, bodies and so on\u201f (Moreira, 2000: 425). This leads us to \nour second concern. As Foucault noted in Birth of the Clinic, Xavier Bichat\u201fs Physiological Researches on \nLife and Death (1800) radically transformed contemporary understanding of biological life, by positing \nfirstly that \u201elife is the sum of all activities that resist death\u201f (Bichat, 1994: 57), and by then materially \nmobilising death to reveal the physiological details of these activities. Death, in Foucault\u201fs words, became \u201ethe \ngreat analyst that shows the connexions by unfolding them, and bursts open the wonders of genesis in the \nrigour of decomposition\u201f (Foucault, 1994a: 145). Strikingly, however, while this understanding entailed the \npresence of biological death wherever there is biological life, regardless of scale, death itself remained outside \nthe domain of biological inquiry, at least until the publication of Weismann\u201fs reflections on ageing and death. \nIn these reflections, Weismann advanced the radical notion that the first organisms in evolutionary history \nwere immortal and that death was an incidental product of the division of labour under natural selection. \nDeath, in other words, ceased to be anything like Bichat\u201fs external, but none the less primary and defining, \nfeature of biological process. Drawing on Deleuze\u201fs observation that, within Bichat\u201fs modern formulation of \nthe relationship between life and death, the advent of death was to be understood as comparable to the \n\u201eviolent death\u201f which the sovereign power visits on the transgressing political subject (Deleuze, 1988: 130; see \nalso Bichat, 1994: 200-9), it is then possible to argue even more incisively that there is no such thing as \n\u201enatural death\u201f (see also Alter & Carmichael, 1997). From this perspective, all that exists is continuous and \nendless transformation. There only is \u201elife itself\u201f. Furthermore, Weismann\u201fs iconoclastic, evolutionary \naccount of the origins of death was critically important to the emergence of the modern theory of heredity, \nwhich is predicated on the division of the organism into an immortal germinal line and a mortal somatic line \n(see Churchill, 1987; Griesemer & Wimsatt, 1989).  In other words, not only is Weismann the more \nproductive point of historical reference for any inquiry into the ontology of the politics of \u201elife itself\u201f, but he \ncould also be said to effectively delineate the \u201econditions of possibility\u201f for the emergence of contemporary \nbio-gerontology as the epistemic field simultaneously engaged in the bio-molecular and bio-demographic \ncharacterisation of pathological processes associated with ageing (Foucault, 1994b: xxii; cf. Hirshbein, 2001). \n  \n14 October 2008: 4 \nThe exact interpretation of Weismann\u201fs argument, however, divides Comfort, Hayflick and Kirkwood in ways \nthat are crucially important to understanding the fuller complexity of the re-alignment of the anatomo-\npolitical and bio-political ordering of ageing and death in the age of \u201emolecular biology\u201f (Deleuze, 1988: 131).  \n \nIn sum, while most socio-cultural analysis of ageing and death tend to frame bio-gerontology as a contested \nfield of knowledge, structured by negotiations of professional and scientific boundaries,  in this paper we \nexplore intellectual formations, material infrastructures and institutional context simultaneously, to advance \nthe notion that the field of bio-gerontology is better understood as a complex space, in which the interactions \nbetween policy considerations, inter-professional relations, and competing epistemic frameworks and \nexperimental practices form partially connected assemblages (see Law & Mol, 2002). We suggest that this \ncomplexity is particularly evident in the periodic re-reading and re-working of Weismann\u201fs argument. From \nthis more complex, historical perspective, scientific objections to contemporary promises of effective \nimmortality become centrally important to the construction of the \u201eend of age\u201f, a construction in which, we \nalso argue, death is radically displaced, but never wholly disappears from the epistemic practices of bio-\ngerontology. This perhaps calls for further reflection on the meaning one might attach to Deleuze\u201fs notion of \n\u201eunlimited finity\u201f and its connotation of an epochal, onto-historical transformation (Deleuze, 1988: 131). \n \nWhy do ageing and death matter? \nBefore examining the re-reading and re-working of August Weismann\u201fs argument about the nature of death, \nit is useful to understand the broadest context in which such re-reading and re-working has unfolded.  \n \nAs Michel Foucault famously argued in The History of Sexuality (1976), the distinctive feature of modern \ngovernmental forms is their investment in maximising the productive powers of the embodied, human \nsubject (see also Foucault, 2004a: 239-264). Historically, this investment was enabled by two different forms \nof organising and structuring the modes of being in relation to others, the anatomo-political and bio-political \narticulations of power. The first of these terms designated the articulation of political power and the material \nconstitution of the human body as it was disclosed by modern disciplinary discourses such as those of \nanatomy and physiology. The second term designated instead the articulation of political power and the \nreproductive potential of the human species, which was operated by the administrative institutions of the \nstate. While very different in their mode of institutional organisation, the relationship between the two forms \nof power over embodied life was a co-constitutive one, best exemplified by the discourse of \u201esexuality\u201f: \n \n  \n14 October 2008: 5 \nSexuality, being an eminently corporeal mode of behaviour, is a matter for individualizing disciplinary controls that take \nthe form of permanent surveillance \u2026 But because it also has procreative effects, sexuality is also inscribed, takes effect, \nin broad biological processes that concern not the bodies of individuals but the element, the multiple unity of the \npopulation. Sexuality exists at the point where the body and population meet. And so it is a matter for discipline, but \nalso a matter for regularization (Foucault, 2004a: 251-2). \n  \nIt should not be surprising that the modern bio-medical disciplines took shape at the point of intersection of \nthe anatomo-political and bio-political forms. Importantly, while the precise role of these bio-medical \ndisciplines has proved to be a matter of intense, but perhaps misguided, debate (see Colgrove, 2002), there is \nlittle disagreement that, wherever modern governmental forms held sway, these disciplines, when taken \ntogether, did aid the elimination of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis as major causes of mortality, and \nthen contributed to delaying the impact of chronic diseases such as cancer. The net effect of this particular, \nhistorical regime was that human longevity has increased extraordinarily during the past century and a half. \nAlthough the statistics of this demographic change have created much confusion, such as the common, but \narguably mistaken, assumption that human life span has also increased (see Fries, 2005), the problems \npresented by an ever larger fraction of the population reaching old age have resulted in the massive \nexpansion of geriatric medicine and the medicalisation of ageing generally (Estes & Binney, 1989; Katz, 1996; \nsee also Armstrong, 1983: 85-92). Concomitantly, questions posed by ageing and death as strictly biological \nphenomena have been relegated to the margins of orthodox bio-medical discourse, to the domain of quacks \nand their promises of eternal youth (see, for example, Hirshbein, 2000; Sengoopta, 2003). Moreover, while \nPhilippe Ari\u00e8s (1987), and Zygmunt Bauman after him (1992), were perhaps mistaken when they argued that \nthese same modern bio-medical disciplines and associated governmental forms have contributed to the \ndisappearance of death from daily life, there are good grounds for believing that these disciplines and forms \nhave contributed greatly to the ontological evacuation of death. In other words, there are good grounds for \nbelieving that death has not so much disappeared from modern daily life, as it has become instead dying, an \nundoubtedly productive performance around a simultaneously emptied centre, devoid of any intrinsic \nmeaning (Palladino, 2004; cf. Seale, 1998). At the same time, however, these socio-cultural changes have \ncome at a great cost, scarcely compensated by a burgeoning death industry. While the expense of defeating \ninfectious diseases and postponing the effects of chronic diseases was defrayed by one insurance scheme or \nanother, this has become increasingly difficult to sustain as the relationship between the number of socially \nfunctional individuals, usually defined as those gainfully employed and paying into the insurance funds, and \nthe number of biologically functional individuals have so diverged that the insurance funds characteristic of \nthe modern governmental form are said to be increasingly unsustainable and requiring new answers (see \nFoucault, 2004b; also Dillon & Lobo-Guerrero, in review). While this has resulted in massive investments in \n  \n14 October 2008: 6 \nreshaping the organisation of old age, so as to synchronise the social and biological functionality of the \nindividual (see Katz & Marshall, 2003; 2004), such possibilities would seem to be limited by the plasticity of \nageing and death as biological phenomena. Perhaps unsurprisingly, whether the age-specific mortality curve \n(see Figure 1) can be effectively squared at the individual, physiological level, so that the pathological \nburdens of old age are not just statistically compressed into a few months of \u201ecatastrophic illness\u201f just before \ndeath, but become the normal experience and common understanding of embodied life and its progress from \nbirth to death, is a question that has greatly exercised the bio-medical disciplines since the 1970s (see Fries, \n2005).  \n \nInsert figure 1 here \n \nThe accompanying discussions of mortality and immortality have attracted much public attention, especially \nas bio-medical scientists such as Aubrey de Grey (2005a) have claimed that these same bio-medical \ndisciplines should re-orient their research toward the achievement of human immortality, because, thanks to \ndevelopments emerging from the bio-molecular sciences, it is now within their grasp (see also Breithaupt & \nHadley, 2005; Bourg, 2000). As noted earlier, such claims are not unprecedented, and have once again \nresulted in concerted, disciplinary efforts to pit the truth of the matter against the unreasonable hopes \ninvested in so-called \u201eanti-ageing medicine\u201f. These efforts have frequently occasioned animated debates \nwhich have sometimes spilled into the media, for example, when Thomas Kirkwood (2005) reviewed very \nunfavourably the promises of anti-ageing medicine, and the editors of Nature, where Kirkwood\u201fs review had \nfirst appeared, refused to grant De Grey any opportunity to respond (De Grey, 2005b; Morelle, 2006; see also \nWarner et al., 2005; Olshansky, Hayflick & Carnes, 2000).  \n \nThis said, analysing the work of bio-gerontology itself, rather than its conflict with anti-ageing medicine, is \nperhaps a more productive approach to understanding the complex relationship between death and the \nemerging politics of \u201elife itself\u201f. \n \nCan organisms live forever? \nIn 1982, Thomas Kirkwood and Thomas Cremer sought to situate the former author\u201fs relatively novel, \nevolutionary theory of ageing and death, the theory of \u201edisposable soma\u201f (Kirkwood, 1977), within a long \ntradition of evolutionary considerations about the two phenomena, a historiographical construct in which \nAugust Weismann became a founding and prophetic, but forgotten, figure (Kirkwood & Cremer, 1982). The \n  \n14 October 2008: 7 \nstriking feature of this account is that Weismann has been mobilised, both before and after Kirkwood and \nCremer\u201fs intervention, to articulate quite different theories of ageing and death to that which Kirkwood has \npromoted very successfully since 1977 (see Kirkwood, 1999), culminating in 2001, with in his invitation to \ndeliver the prestigious BBC Reith Lectures (Kirkwood, 2001).  \n \nKirkwood and Cremer continue their historical reconstruction of bio-gerontology by noting  that Leonard \nHayflick\u201fs work on the life cycle of the cell \u201eopened fresh speculation into the possibility that ageing might be \ndue to intrinsic limitations in the life of somatic cells\u201f (Kirkwood & Cremer, 1982: 108; see also Cooper, \n2006: 1-2). In 1961, while still working in the field of experimental oncology, Hayflick called into question the \nprevailing notion that somatic cell lines, those lines of cells which are found in multicellular organisms and \ndo not divide or differentiate to produce a new line, were immortal when cultivated in vitro (Hayflick & \nMoorhead, 1961). While many doubts had previously been expressed about this notion that somatic cell lines \nwere potentially immortal (see Witkowski, 1979; Landecker, 2003), its credibility was consolidated by the \nembedding of the assumption within the repertoire of material practices underpinning the expansive domain \nof research into the causes of cancer (see Patterson, 1987). In the process of examining the differences \nbetween cancerous and non-cancerous cell lines, however, Hayflick concluded that the lifespan of non-\ncancerous cells lines was in fact finite, and that an internal mechanism limited the number of replications the \ncell lines could undergo, a limit which Hayflick and Paul Moorehead named the \u201ePhase III Phenomenon\u201f, but \nnow goes by the name of \u201eHayflick limit\u201f (see Shay & Wright, 2000). On the one hand, while many \ncontemporary researchers remained unpersuaded by both Hayflick\u201fs claim and by his controversial \nsuggestion that the contrary, prevailing view was in fact an artefact of material practices within experimental \noncology, the notion that somatic cells were potentially immortal meant that ageing and death were \ndetermined either at higher levels of biological organisation than the cell or by factors wholly external to the \norganism. From this perspective, the process of ageing and the advent of death were a matter of interest to \nclinical, geriatric medicine alone. On the other hand, Hayflick\u201fs claim that ageing and death were determined \nat the cellular level became increasingly attractive to bio-medical researchers as research into possible \ntreatments for cancer was perceived as having reached an impasse, so much so that its central experimental \npractices were coming under close, critical scrutiny (see L\u00f6wy & Gaudilli\u00e8re, 1998: 231-2), and the field of \nbio-gerontology, thanks to growing concerns about the bio-political implications of an ageing population, \nwas simultaneously acquiring its own, distinctive institutional basis (see Katz, 1996). Importantly, Hayflick \nwas no passive bystander, but was instead centrally involved in mediating these growing concerns about the \nbio-political implications of an ageing population into institutional structures which might support research \n  \n14 October 2008: 8 \ninto the cellular and sub-cellular bases of ageing and death. His efforts were so successful that, in 1974, he \nwas offered the opportunity to become the first director of the National Institutes of Health National \nInstitute of Aging (NIA), which had just been established by legislative act of the United States Congress \n(Rattan, 2001).1 By 1975, moreover, not only had Hayflick\u201fs formerly heterodox claim been rearticulated into \nthe notion that the mechanism controlling cellular ageing and longevity was located in the cellular nucleus, \nwhich implied some form of genetic control (Wright & Hayflick, 1975), but it also helped to consolidate a new \napproach to investigating the causes of cancer, focussing on the capacity of viruses to somehow re-\nprogramme the genomic control of cellular functions so as to bring about the limitless reproduction of \nsomatic lines. While these developments firmly positioned the emerging field of \u201ebio-gerontology\u201f within the \nexpanding genomic sciences, the notion that ageing and death were genetically determined also threatened to \nundermine the autonomy of bio-gerontology, so that it was equally important to maintain an exclusive and \ndistinctive link to the simultaneously expanding field of clinical, geriatric medicine and its investment in the \nphysiological complexity and distinctiveness of the diseases of old age (Katz, 1996; Holstein, 2000; see also \nKeating & Cambrosio, 2003: 49-82).  \n \nConsiderations about the relationship between bio-gerontology and the genomic sciences, a relationship \nwhich arguably was inaugurated by Hayflick\u201fs experimental studies of the cell\u201fs life cycle, became particularly \nimportant in the wake of ever-increasing public concern about the prospect of old age and its accompanying \nfrailties, especially as some of the new specialists in bio-gerontology began to draw on the promises of the \ngenomic sciences to argue that ageing was so genetically \u201eprogrammed\u201f as to hold out the further promise of \nbeing able to engineer the end of ageing (see Milburn, 2002). Thus, if much of this promise seems a matter of \nblurring the boundaries between science and fiction, the mechanism underlying the \u201eHayflick limit\u201f has been \ntraced much more prosaically to the shortening of telomeres during the process of genomic replication, so \nthat it is now possible to extend the life of a somatic cell lines by modifying the telomeres and so \n\u201eimmortalise\u201f the lines. This, in turn, has generated great interest in the therapeutic potential of telomerase to \nhalt the process of ageing, currently sustained and explored by companies such as the appositely named \nGeron Corporation (see Magalh\u00e3es & Toussaint, 2004; also Hall, 2003). Consequently, as Hayflick extended \nhis understanding of cellular ageing and death to address and capture the growing public concern about the \nprospect of ageing, but with an eye to maintaining the links between bio-gerontology and clinical, geriatric \nmedicine, he repeatedly stressed that questions of ageing and longevity were not to be confused (see \nHayflick, 1995; see also Rattan, 2000). Admittedly, Hayflick himself had contributed to such confusion, so \n  \n14 October 2008: 9 \nthat, in 1997, in a technical review of research on cellular mortality and immortality, he insisted in noting \nthat, in his original investigations of cellular immortality: \n \nOur suggestion that the Phase III Phenomenon was aging at the cell level was made because it was relatively simple to \neliminate other explanations for our observations but we were unable to eliminate the possibility that the phenomenon \nwas, indeed, aging at the cellular level. Our failure to eliminate aging as the cause of the event was not based on our \ninability to design the right experiment but because there were no accepted criteria for identifying biological aging \u2013 a \nproblem that to this day remains substantially unresolved (Hayflick, 1997: 1183; emphases added). \n \nOf key importance is that the principal intellectual resource for maintaining this epistemic and political \nboundary between the genetic determination of life span and the physiological process of ageing has been the \nrecourse to evolutionary theory. In 1989, for example, Hayflick argued that, \n \nEvidence that longevity is determined by genetic events is overwhelming but evidence that age changes are the result of \ngene expression is not. \u2026 [N]atural selection could not have favoured the development of a genetically programmed \naging process. In the 2 or 3 million years of human existence, too few old humans existed to have provided a selective \nadvantage favouring the development of a genetic program that would determine age changes. The selective advantage \nof maintaining physiological vigour for as long as possible in order to insure maximum reproductive success may be the \nessential indirect determinant of longevity (Hayflick, 1989: 355; emphases added). \n \nThe reference point for Hayflick\u201fs evolutionary considerations and the problems they posed for any notion of \na genetically programmed ageing process was none other than Kirkwood and Cremer\u201fs historical review. \nFurther, in the later, revisionist account of his pioneering research on the life cycle of the somatic cell, \nHayflick again drew on Kirkwood and Cremer\u201fs historical review, this time to tie his work to Weismann\u201fs \nstatement that \u201edeath takes place because a worn-out tissue cannot forever renew itself, and because a \ncapacity for increase by means of cell division is not everlasting but finite\u201f (Hayflick, 1997: 1180). Had \nHayflick read Weismann\u201fs text itself, he might have latched onto the following, even more germane historical \nantecedent: \n \nIt is, in my opinion, an advance if we may assume that the length of life is dependent upon the number of generations of \nsomatic cells which can succeed one another in the course of a single life; and furthermore, that this number, as well as \nthe duration of each single cell-generation, is predestined by the germ itself (Weismann, 1883: 147; emphasis added). \n \nMore importantly, however, the history of Hayflick\u201fs evolutionary considerations could also be said to have \nstarted much earlier than it transpired in 1989.  \n  \n14 October 2008: 10 \n \nWhy must organisms age and die? \nThe notion that the extension of longevity need not entail any change of life-span is not nearly as arresting \nand provocative as the notion that ageing is not in fact a universal feature of biological life, the extreme case \nbeing the Pacific salmon, Oncorhynchus spp., which does not age, but dies immediately after completing its \ntask of reproduction. Ageing, it would seem, is peculiar to those species that can survive long after \nreproduction, thanks, for example, to the social mores that call on younger humans to help and protect the \nelderly, so much so that ageing, like cancer, might be said to be a \u201edisease of civilisation\u201f (see Porter, 1993). \nThese ideas were critically important to the emergence of evolutionary explanations of ageing and death. As \nearly as 1973, Leonard Hayflick was drawing on such explanations to consolidate his argument that longevity \nwas genetically determined and was doing so by drawing tacitly on Alex Comfort\u201fs very successful and \ninfluential The Biology of Senescence (see Hayflick, 1973). In fact, if Hayflick can be viewed as he who \ndeveloped the material and institutional wherewithal for the constitution of bio-gerontology as a major, \nautonomous field of biomedical research, Comfort\u201fs The Biology of Senescence, first published in 1956 and \nthen twice re-published, in 1964 and 1979, provided the intellectual foundations for the redefinition of \nclinical, geriatric medicine as resting on an understanding of ageing and death as fundamentally biological \nproblems (see Medvedev, 2000).  \n \nStrikingly, the very passage from August Weismann which Hayflick cited in 1997, is the very same passage \nwhich, according to Thomas Kirkwood and Thomas Cremer, had created much confusion among earlier \nreaders of Weismann\u201fs work on the evolution of ageing and death, particularly Comfort (see Kirkwood & \nCremer, 1982: 113). Comfort opens The Biology of Senescence with the following words: \n \nMan throughout history, and every individual since childhood, has been aware that he himself, and those animals which \nhe has kept in domestication, will undergo an adverse change with the passage of time. Their fertility, strength and \nactivity decreases, and their liability to die from causes which, earlier in life, they could have resisted, increases.  \nThis process of change is senescence, and senescence enters human experience through the fact that man exhibits it \nhimself. This close involvement with human fears and aspirations may account for the very extensive metaphysical \nliterature of ageing. It certainly accounts for the profound concern with which humanity has tended to regard the \nsubject. To a great extent human history and psychology must always have been determined and moulded by the \nawareness that the life-span of any individual is determinate, and that the expectation of life tends to decrease with \nincreasing age \u2026 Every child since the emergence of language has probably asked \u201eWhy did that man die?\u201f and has been \ntold \u201eHe died because he was old\u201f. \nInteresting psychological and historical speculation could be made on the part which this awareness has played in \nhuman affairs. From the biologist\u201fs standpoint, its main importance has been the bias which it has injected into the \nstudy of senescence. The child who asks the question and receives the answer, is familiar with \u201eold\u201f clothes and \u201eold toys\u201f. \nHe has always known that he, his pets, his cattle and his neighbours will become increasingly prone to breakdown and \n  \n14 October 2008: 11 \nultimate death the older they get. He has observed from the nursery that inanimate and mechanical systems also \ndeteriorate with the passage of time. He appears at a later age to derive some degree of comfort from the contemplation \nof the supposed generality, universality and fundamental inherence of ageing \u2013 or alternatively from drawing a contrast \nbetween Divine or cosmic permanence and his own transience. However inspiring this type of thinking may be \u2013 and it \nfeatures largely in the past artistic and philosophical productions of all cultures \u2013 its influence and its incorporation as \nsecond nature into the thought of biologists throughout history has seriously handicapped the attempt to understand \nwhat exactly takes place in senescence, which organism exhibit it, and how far it is really analogous to the process of \nmechanical wear. One result of the involvement of senescence with philosophy and the \u201ethings that matter\u201f has been the \nprevalence of attempts to demonstrate general theories of senile change, including all metazoan and even inanimate \nobjects, and having an edifying and a metaphysical cast. Prominent with among these have been the attempts to equate \nageing with development, with the \u201eprice\u201f of multicellular existence, with hypothetical mechano-chemical changes in \ncolloid systems, with the exhaustion induced by reproductive processes, and with various concepts tending to the \nphilosophical contemplation of decline and death (Comfort, 1956: 1-2). \n \nThe prime target of this rhetorical onslaught was Weismann, as proponent of a theory of ageing which \n\u201ethough untenable\u201f, none the less enjoyed \u201econsiderable surviving influence\u201f (Comfort, 1956: 9).  \n \nComfort\u201fs principal objection was to Weismann\u201fs statement that \u201edeath takes place because a worn-out tissue \ncannot forever renew itself \u2026 Worn-out individuals are not only valueless to the species, but they are even \nharmful, for they take the place of those which are sound\u201f (as quoted in Comfort, 1956: 9). The fuller \nstatement of Weismann\u201fs proposition is: \n \nWorn-out individuals are not only valueless to the species, but they are even harmful, for they take the place of those \nwhich are sound. Hence by the operation of natural selection, the life of our hypothetically immortal individual would be \nshortened by the amount which was useless to the species. It would be reduced to a length which would afford the most \nfavourable conditions for the existence of as large a number as possible of vigorous individuals, at the same time. \nIf by these considerations death is shown to be a beneficial occurrence, it by no means follows that it might be solely \naccounted for on grounds of utility. Death might also depend on causes which lie in the nature of life itself. The floating \nof ice upon water seems to us to be a useful arrangement, although the fact that it does float depends upon its molecular \nstructure and not upon the fact that its doing so is of any advantage to us. In the like manner the necessity of death has \nbeen hitherto explained as due to causes which are inherent in organic nature, and not to the fact that it may be \nadvantageous. \nI do not however believe in the validity of this explanation; I consider that death is not a primary necessity, but that it \nhas been secondarily acquired as an adaptation. I believe that life is endowed with a fixed duration, not because it is \ncontrary to nature to be unlimited, but because the unlimited existence of individuals would be a luxury without \ncorresponding advantage. The above-mentioned hypothesis upon the origin and necessity of death leads me to believe \nthat the organism did not finally cease to renew the worn-out cell material because the nature of the cells did not permit \nthem to multiply indefinitely, but because the power of multiplying indefinitely was lost when it ceased to be of use \n(Weismann, 1881: 24-5). \n \nComfort\u201fs specific criticism of this explanation of ageing and death was that it \u201eboth assumes what it sets out \nto explain, that the survival value of an individual decreases with increasing age, and denies its own premise, \nby suggesting that worn-out individuals threaten the existence of the young\u201f (Comfort, 1956: 9). In other \n  \n14 October 2008: 12 \nwords, according to Comfort, Weismann did not explain why, but instead simply assumed that increasing age \nled to impaired biological function, and then argued, not wholly coherently, that this debilitating process \nnone the less was of some benefit to the species. Comfort advanced instead the notion that \u201esenescence is to \nbe regarded not as the positively beneficial character which Weismann believed it to be, but as a potentiality \nlying outside the part of the life cycle which is relevant to evolution\u201f (Comfort, 1956: 39). More specifically, \ndrawing on J.B.S. Haldane and Peter Medawar\u201fs bio-mathematical considerations on the genetics of \npopulations and evolutionary process, he argued that natural selection operated most forcefully on those \nphases of the life cycle which were related to reproduction, so that the phenotypic expression of any \ndeleterious mutations in these phases would be targeted more strongly than their expression in post-\nreproductive phases. This, according to Comfort, led to an accumulation of deleterious genes whose \nexpression occurred in the later phases of the life cycle, eventually resulting in the genetic determination of \nthe post-reproductive, gradual weakening of the organism commonly known as \u201eageing\u201f. In other words, the \nemergence of ageing and death was not the fruit of any selective advantage to the species, but a secondary \nand accidental consequence of the selective forces shaping earlier phases of the individual organism\u201fs life \ncycle, up to the termination of reproduction. Given such an intimate link between sex and death, which \nComfort may have started to consider much earlier that the publication of The Biology of Senescence might \nsuggest (see Comfort, 1950), it perhaps is no surprise that that Comfort is today more famous as the author of \nThe Joy of Sex (1972) (see also Katz & Marshall, 2003; 2004). \n \nThe problem that Comfort\u201fs evolutionary account posed for Hayflick, however, was that the so-called \u201eage \nspecific diseases\u201f were to be understood as genetically determined diseases that expressed themselves in \nolder populations, that is to say, in those populations which, thanks to social mechanisms, were able to \nsurvive beyond the completion of their reproductive functions. Ageing, from this evolutionary perspective, \nwas a fundamental problem for geneticists and social policy analysts alone. Moreover, this understanding of \nageing and death as fundamentally plastic has proved enormously captivating, especially as geneticists were \nincreasingly able to demonstrate experimentally the plasticity of life span by repeatedly selecting sub-\npopulations of fruit-flies such as Drosophila melanogaster and worms such as Caenorhabditis elegans which \nreproduced later than the norm for the population under examination (Meek, 2001; see also Haraway, 1997). \nFigures such as Hayflick then had to redouble their insistence that questions of life span were of little \nrelevance to understanding the far more complex and clinically pressing questions of ageing, and it is no \nsurprise therefore that Hayflick has latched on to more recent findings that those strains of C. elegans bred \nfor longer life span are evolutionarily less fit than the normal strains (Hayflick, 2005). Extending the \n  \n14 October 2008: 13 \norganism\u201fs life span beyond the limits fixed by natural selection comes at the cost of increased illness, which \nis the problem that motivated the expansion of bio-gerontology in the very first place, so that the proper task \nof bio-gerontology is to understand the complex cellular and sub-cellular processes resulting in the decay of \nthe organism\u201fs \u201evigour\u201f. In sum, Hayflick\u201fs thesis is that the central, organising question for bio-gerontology \nshould be \u201ewhy are old cells more vulnerable to pathology and disease than young ones?\u201f (Hayflick, 1998: \n639; emphasis added). This construction of bio-gerontology and its task is important to understanding \nHayflick\u201fs eventual shift from Comfort\u201fs to Kirkwood\u201fs evolutionary explanation of ageing and death. \n \nWhy do organisms live as long as they do? \nWhile drawing on the evolutionary approach to understanding the phenomena of ageing and death which \nAlex Comfort popularised with the publication of The Biology of Senescence, Thomas Kirkwood\u201fs disposition \ntoward August Weismann is far more positive that Comfort\u201fs. This is not simply because Kirkwood, as he \nhimself suggests, attends to Weismann\u201fs Life and Death, rather The Duration of Life, the former of which \noffers an evolutionary explanation that avoids the group-selectionism implied by the statement that \u201eworn-\nout individuals are not only valueless to the species, but they are even harmful, for they take the place of \nthose which are sound\u201f. Rather, it is because, in this essay, Weismann articulates more clearly a pivotal \ndistinction between \u201egerm\u201f and \u201esoma\u201f, a distinction which, despite much conceptual confusion, has proved \nfundamentally important to the emergence of the genetic theory of heredity and its ambitions to account for \nall biological phenomena, from the genetic to the populational and evolutionary levels (see Churchill, 1987; \nGriesemer & Wimsatt, 1989). \n \nAccording to Kirkwood\u201fs reading of Weismann, if there is continuity of life despite the ubiquity of death, it is \nbecause all organisms are potentially immortal, but the division of labour under natural selection has \nresulted in some organisms evolving two fundamentally different types of cells, somatic and germinal, to \nbetter insure the continuity of life against external, accidental causes of mortality, that is, against what Gilles \nDeleuze would eventually label as \u201eviolent death\u201f. It is this more general understanding that, Kirkwood \nclaims, underpins Weismann\u201fs following statement: \n \nProbably at first the somatic cells were not more numerous than the reproductive cells, and while this was the case the \nphenomenon of death was inconspicuous, for that which dies was very small. But as the somatic cells relatively \nincreased, the body became of more importance as compared with the reproductive cells, until death seems to affect the \nwhole individual, as in the higher animals, from which our ideas upon the subject are derived. In reality, however, only \none part succumbs to natural death, but it is a part which in size far surpasses that which remains and is immortal, the \nreproductive cells (Weismann, 1883: 145). \n  \n14 October 2008: 14 \n \nThis distinction between the immortality of the germinal line and the mortality of the somatic line, \nrearticulated in terms of genes and organisms, is critically important to Kirkwood\u201fs alternative evolutionary \nexplanation of ageing and death. Beginning in 1977, and drawing on optimality theories of evolutionary \nfitness, greatly popularised by Richard Dawkins\u201f The Selfish Gene (1975), Kirkwood argued that the organism \nis the product of a process of balancing energetic investments in the somatic body, to enhance the chances of \nsuccessful reproduction, and the cost of these investments to the continuity of the genetic line, which is \nequally exposed to entropic dissipation (see Kirkwood, 1977; Kirkwood & Halliday, 1979; see also Dawkins, \n1975: 42-5). That Kirkwood\u201fs first two expositions of this idea have now been cited in over a thousand \nscientific papers, attests to its momentous importance. On this alternative evolutionary understanding of \ndeath and ageing, Comfort\u201fs notion that natural selection delayed the expression of deleterious genes is \ncompatible, but it also is an unnecessary hypothesis which detracts attention from the genetic mechanisms \nthat neutralise the phenotypic effects of any deleterious mutations. In other words, not only is the organism \nto be understood as constantly confronting the problems posed by entropic dissipation, specifically by \ngenetic mutation, from its very birth, but the theory of \u201edisposable soma\u201f also redirects the attention of \nevolutionary perspectives on the processes of ageing and death toward \u201ethe evolved capacity of somatic cells \nto carry out effective maintenance and repair\u201f as the key to understanding \u201ethe time taken for damage to \naccumulate to levels where it interferes with the organism\u201fs viability, and hence \u2026 longevity\u201f (Kirkwood & \nAustad, 2000: 235). \n \nImportantly, from this alternative evolutionary perspective, which combines bio-demographic and molecular \nperspectives, the notion that ageing and death are genetically programmed is untenable, and the notion that \nthere are any such things as genetically determined \u201eage-specific\u201f diseases, though still plausible, is less than \nuseful to bio-gerontology. The controversial nature of these implications is evident in the arguments around \nthe question \u201eis there a program for aging?\u201f, which the editor of Aging Cell, Simon Melov, staged with the aid \nof one of Kirkwood\u201fs most important collaborators, the behavioural ecologist turned experimental \ngerontologist Steven Austad (Melov, 2004; see also Kirkwood & Austad, 2000). Furthermore, Hayflick\u201fs \ndistinction between questions of longevity and ageing also collapses insofar as the two become intimately \nrelated, secondary effects of any damage to the genetically determined mechanisms which preserve the \nviability of the organism until successful reproduction and transmission of the genetic line. On the other \nhand, bearing in mind that Hayflick\u201fs prescriptive question for bio-gerontology is \u201ewhy are old cells more \nvulnerable to pathology and disease than young ones?\u201f, this alternative, evolutionary perspective entails a \n  \n14 October 2008: 15 \npartly shared redefinition of bio-gerontology as engaged in the identification of both those genomic \nmechanisms which ensure the preservation of reproductive functionality and the causes of their decay, whose \ncomplex and manifold, long-term, secondary consequences are expressed as the symptoms of old age and are \na matter of concern to clinical, geriatric medicine. This approach might then entail, for example, attempting \nto trace the bio-molecular and bio-demographic pathways of aging individuals who might be \u201eat risk\u201f of \ndeveloping diseases such as Alzheimer\u201fs Disease backward, to the earliest possible manifestations of \nforgetfulness, to the earliest possible manifestations of Mild Cognitive Impairment (see Moreira, 2007). The \naim here is to develop multiple interventions, both biomedical and behavioural, which might prevent clinical \nprogression from Mild Cognitive Impairment to Alzheimer\u201fs Disease. This said, insofar as the differences \nbetween Alzheimer\u201fs Disease and non-age specific dysfunctional states are blurred in the process, Kirkwood \nalso insists on jettisoning all qualitative contrasts between \u201eyoung\u201f and \u201eold\u201f as biologically meaningless and \ndistracting. What is important is instead to better understand and intervene in the chain of external events \nwhich shorten or lengthen the \u201etime taken for damage to accumulate to levels where it interferes with the \norganism\u201fs viability, and hence \u2026 longevity\u201f (see also Holstein, 2000; Ballenger, 2006).  \n \nIn other words, following Kirkwood\u201fs alternative evolutionary explanation of ageing and death, the business \nof biomedicine is to enhance the ability of the individual to imitate the immortal germinal line. Though \nimmortality itself is irretrievably denied by the evolutionary history of the human species, this redefinition of \nthe business of bio-gerontology will at least result in squaring the mortality curve, that is, it will at least result \nin the fuller synchronisation of mortality and bio-social functionality. Such anatomo-political restitution of \nbio-social functionality, which is consonant with contemporary anti-ageist social policies, might even have \nevolutionary consequences, if it were to enhance the successful transmission of the genetic line. As Kirkwood \nand Daryl Shanley have put it, with respect to the evolution of menopause: \n \nMenopause enhances fitness by producing post-reproductive grandmothers who can assist their adult offspring by \nsharing in the burden of provisioning and protecting their grandchildren (Shanley & Kirkwood, 2001: 282). \n \nCollapsing the boundaries between nature and culture, Kirkwood\u201fs argument is that the selfish logic of the \ngene does not necessarily disown obligation and responsibility to the elderly, but could in fact greatly \nenhance such sense of obligation and responsibility, if only humans were to fully come to terms with their \nconstitution as disposable vehicles for the reproduction of the genetic line, if not life more generally. \nArguably, this is no more than the biological translation of the Durkheimian arguments about immortality, \nwhich Zygmunt Bauman (1992) has advanced at the more orthodox, symbolic level (see also Rabinow, 1996). \n  \n14 October 2008: 16 \n \nStabilisation? \nAs James Griesemer (2005; see also Griesemer & Wimsatt, 1989) has argued, with regard to Richard \nDawkins\u201f notion of the \u201eselfish gene\u201f, the appropriations of the categorical distinction between mortal, \nsomatic lines and immortal, germinal line, which August Weismann articulated at the end of the nineteenth \ncentury, are conceptually problematic, insofar as they have involved an increasingly radical abstraction from \nthe specific material entities and physiological processes to which the distinction originally referred. Not only \nis it then increasingly unclear how the distinction is supposed to relate to the different material contexts in \nwhich it is deployed, but it is also unclear how it is to be tested empirically. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the same \napplies to Thomas Kirkwood\u201fs intimately related theory of \u201edisposable soma\u201f, which seems difficult \nexperimentally to tease apart from alternative evolutionary perspectives on ageing and death, and is not \nobviously supported by human demographic data (see Bourg, 2001; see also Promislow & Pletcher, 2002). \nThe crucial historical question then is what stabilises the theory of \u201edisposable soma\u201f, despite these \nconceptual and empirical problems. Drawing on Michel Callon (1986) and Bruno Latour (1987), we suggest \nthat the stabilisation of Kirkwood\u201fs understanding of ageing and death rests on a reconfiguration of the \nassemblage of interested actors.  \n \nThe roots of the great success enjoyed by Kirkwood\u201fs theory among bio-gerontologists are to be found \nprimarily in the way in which it directs attention away from death itself, toward the mechanisms involved in \nmaintaining the viability of the organism in the light of its inherent fragility. This reorientation is partly \noperated by downplaying the importance of Alex Comfort\u201fs contributions to evolutionary explanations ageing \nand death, which limit the possibilities of intervention (see Holliday, 2000a; 2000b). This enables a fuller \nalignment of evolutionary perspectives with the field of bio-gerontology opened up by Leonard Hayflick\u201fs \nexperimental demonstration that somatic cell lines are far from immortal. At the same time, however, this \nperspective also moves bio-gerontology away from Hayflick\u201fs thesis that the central question should be \u201ewhy \nare old cells more vulnerable to pathology and disease than young ones?\u201f, a thesis that still assigns a \nfundamental, biological meaning to chronological terms such as \u201eold\u201f and \u201eyoung\u201f. The aim of bio-gerontology \nbecomes instead to understand the differences between the repair mechanisms of germinal and somatic \nlines. There can be little doubt that investigation of these mechanisms greatly expands the potential market \nfor those pharmaceutical companies that have invested in the development of treatments for the ailments of \nold age, such as the Geron Corporation with respect to Alzheimer\u201fs Disease, because the threshold of \ntreatment moves ever backward to encompass a greater fraction of the population. This said, Kirkwood \n  \n14 October 2008: 17 \ndistinctive approach to the reconstruction of Alzheimer\u201fs Disease as an early onset \u201edegenerative\u201f disease, \nwhich integrates research into the molecular bases of disease and bio-demographic considerations, is a \nreminder that the field of bio-gerontology is today developing within a more general reorientation of health \npolicy toward the promotion of individual choices to avoid careless behaviours toward oneself and others \n(see Conrad, 1992; Petersen, 1997). In Kirkwood\u201fs case, it means both avoiding behaviours that undermine \nthe continued viability of the molecular repair mechanisms, and engaging in those activities that apparently \nenhance the responsiveness of these repair mechanisms. In this, bio-gerontology seems partially \ndisconnected to the technology-based interventions that appear to characterise contemporary bio-medicine \n(see Clarke et al., 2003)  As Kirkwood puts it, in the last lines of Time of Our Lives: \n \nFreedom makes us individually responsible for our choices and our actions. Is this why we so readily drug ourselves into \ninactivity with low-demand time-fillers when we could do so much? Let us be truly alive, so that when old age finally \nrobs us of our vitality, we may feel that the time of our lives was well spent (Kirkwood, 1999: 242; see also Katz & \nMarshall, 2004).  \n \nThis call-to-arms to maximise the returns of human capital has resonated so loudly that, in 2004, Kirkwood \nbecame the scientific adviser to the House of Lords inquiry into the Scientific Aspects of Ageing, which was \n\u201eespecially interested in the biological processes of ageing, and in promising areas of research which might \nbenefit older people and delay the onset of long-term illnesses and disabilities\u201f (House of Lords, 2005; \nemphasis added).  \n \nIn sum, Kirkwood has striven firstly to distance bio-gerontology from geriatric medicine, insofar as the latter \nmight be understood as a field of clinical specialisation concerned with the diseases of a nosologically distinct \npopulation, the elderly. As these diseases are re-articulated as unfolding temporally onto antecedent risk \nfactors and bio-molecular pathways, they become part of that wider set of \u201edegenerative diseases\u201f which \ncharacterise advanced societies, that is, those societies where the anatomo-political and bio-political \ngovernmental forms converge most forcefully. Within this configuration of bio-gerontology, all of these \ndiseases might be said to entail \u201eageing\u201f, but in so expanding its domain of application the term \u201eageing\u201f loses \nits identity as a process of its own kind. Secondly, bio-gerontology can then speak to all clinical practitioners \ninvolved in managing these degenerative diseases, from the primary care practitioners controlling their \nmiddle-aged patients\u201f hypertension to the specialised clinician assessing the earliest symptoms of \nAlzheimer\u201fs Disease. From this perspective, bio-gerontology also offers opportunities of development to a \ngreat variety of actors in the market for health care, not only those interested in developing drugs to \nmodulate and possibly prevent the mechanism that lead to degenerative disease, but also to those providing \n  \n14 October 2008: 18 \nthe wherewithal and support to secure \u201ehealthy lifestyles\u201f . Thirdly, bio-gerontology stabilises a central \nexpectation of health providers, private and public, namely reducing the prevalence of degenerative diseases \nand thus reducing the aggregate cost of provision: from their perspective, it would be better if we all died of a \nsudden, massive heat-attack or some such \u201ecatastrophic illness\u201f, rather than developing long-term, \ndebilitating and ultimately fatal conditions such as Alzheimer\u201fs Disease. Fourthly and finally, and perhaps \nmost importantly, bio-gerontology re-articulates what has been called the \u201eproblem of aging\u201f in \ncontemporary, advanced societies by reinforcing the increasing re-orientation of health policy towards \nprevention and health surveillance. In so doing, diseases of the elderly come to represent failures of these \npreventive and surveillance systems, and thus the unwelcome remains of a previous epoch where death, as \nterminus of a biologically unavoidable process of decay, dominated the epistemological and political \nlandscape of medicine.  \n  \nImportantly, if this is the more credible horizon of bio-gerontology, mediating the interaction between the \ntherapeutic culture of modern, clinical medicine and the emerging discourse of personal responsibility for \nbodily dysfunction, ageing, the gradual process of declining biological function, will eventually be no longer. \nThis is crucial to better understand the implications of Gilles Deleuze\u201fs claim that the emerging governmental \norder is one in which the modern calculus of finitude gives way to the unlimited recombination of a finite \nnumber of components. After Martin Heidegger (1962: 297-311), the notion of human finitude, to which \nMichel Foucault and others attached great importance (see Palladino, in press), could only be constructed \naround the phenomenological experience of ageing and decline. If, however, this experience of ageing and \ndecline were to disappear and be replaced by the sudden death conjured by the perfectly squared mortality \ncurve, so would the notion of finitude, for which death has long been the symbolic figure. In other words, \ndespite Kirkwood\u201fs objections to the claims articulated by the like of Aubrey de Grey that the genomic \nsciences will soon deliver something approaching human immortality, Kirkwood\u201fs more conservative \nprogramme for the future development of bio-gerontology very powerfully helps to constitute a wholly new \nunderstanding of human embodiment. If the effective contamination of youth by old age, which bio-\ngerontology effects by pushing the physiological precursors of ageing and death ever backward in time, might \nseem to reaffirm and materially bolster the old adage that \u201eas soon as man is born, he begins to die\u201f, by \nproposing the biological needlessness of ageing, bio-gerontology also begins to lend material foundations to \nthe growing perception among successive cohorts that death is a preventable and unnecessary event. From \nthis perspective, the arguments around \u201eanti-ageing\u201f medicine are perhaps best described as the equally \nproverbial \u201estorm in a tea-cup\u201f. \n  \n14 October 2008: 19 \n  \nConclusion \nPaul Rabinow, Nikolas Rose and others have argued that we are currently witnessing a truly epochal \ntransformation of governmental mechanisms, which Rose himself has characterised as the advent of a \npolitics structured around \u201elife itself\u201f. Since the argument is indebted ultimately to Gilles Deleuze\u201fs \nobservation that, in the age of \u201emolecular biology\u201f, the governing truth no longer is the finitude of human life, \nbut the endless possibilities of bio-molecular recombination, we have then sought to ask how the \nphenomenon of death might figure within the emerging governmental order. \n \nWhile aware of, and in fact indebted to, an extensive literature on the contemporary social and cultural \nreconfiguration of ageing and death, we have sought to answer our question about the fate of death by \nattending to the complex relations within the epistemic practices of bio-gerontology, the scientific field which \nseeks to characterise the bio-molecular and bio-demographic mechanisms involved in the process of ageing \nand its consummation in death. We have also sought to consider death as a specifically biological \nphenomenon because it is only at this level that we can properly examine the extent to which the \ncontemporary transformation of governmental mechanisms might be understood as marking a properly \nonto-historical rupture. It is from this perspective that we have explored the interactions of intellectual \nformations, material infrastructures and institutional contexts that have shaped the emergence of bio-\ngerontology and its programme to deliver what the leading bio-gerontologist Thomas Kirkwood calls the \u201eend \nof age\u201f. We have argued that, although figures such as Kirkwood have challenged the scientific merits of ever-\nmore frequent public statements that immortality is today within reach of the bio-medical sciences, these \nvery critiques are critically important to the elimination of death: although immortality itself might be \nforeclosed by the evolutionary history of the human species, the prospective elimination of chronic, \ndegenerative diseases and the resultant squaring of the mortality curve powerfully, if not definitively, \nexorcises the spectral presence of death from the contemporary discourse of public health.  \nThis said, we also wish to suggest rather more tentatively that this reconfiguration of death should be \ninterpreted as exactly that, as a re-configuration of the same. In other words, death and the epistemic values \nattached to it have in fact neither disappeared nor been evacuated, but have instead moved further into the \nrole of epistemic material within the practices of laboratory science that both support bio-gerontology and \nthe experimental programmes of the bio-medical disciplines concerned with degenerative diseases. In this \nprocess, death is not the primary object of experimentation, as was the case with the practices that fascinated \nMichel Foucault, but it becomes part of an interpretative strategy to make sense of experimental outcomes. \n  \n14 October 2008: 20 \nIf, as Kirkwood and others suggest, death is mainly the work of accident and the violence of our life-styles, \nthe death of cells in the laboratory is interpreted as evidence of unsound handling or managing of life within \nexperimental systems, that is to say, it is interpreted as experimental error. This understanding reaffirms \nGeorges Canguilhem\u201fs perceptive suggestion that the genomic sciences introduce a new understanding of \ndisease and death, namely that they are the consequence of \u201eerror\u201f, the computational error of a life system \n(Canguilhem, 1991: 275-287). On the other hand, as Canguilhem would have also commented critically, \ndeath still figures as a possible outcome of bio-medical research, as a possible outcome of a particular \nexperimental procedure or therapeutic intervention, and, moreover, it is the comparison between life and \ndeath which constitutes the epistemic value of the experiment or the intervention in question. This \nunderstanding of bio-gerontology and its epistemic practices, we suggest finally, might be quite important to \nour more general understanding of the politics of \u201elife itself\u201f.  \n \nParaphrasing Michel Foucault, we might say that the centrality of death to the modern governmental \nformation derived from the triangulation of ontology, epistemology and existential meaning (see also Ari\u00e8s, \n1987). From this perspective, bio-gerontology\u201fs articulation of death might be said to have destabilised this \ntriangular relationship by undermining the radical epistemic obscurity that troubled Xavier Bichat, but such \ndestabilisation has not resulted in any concomitant ontological and existential shift. After all, death or the \nproductive process of dying continues to be a significant component of social life in contemporary societies, \nand the ontology of death remains at odds with the epistemic path blazed by bio-gerontology. In other words, \nDeleuze\u201fs formative suggestion that the contemporary development of the bio-medical sciences heralds a \nproperly onto-historical shift must remain a matter of further debate, because, despite all the epistemic, \ntechno-scientific reconfigurations which we have only begun to trace in this paper, contemporary culture and \nsociety would not seem to have moved any great distance from Bichat\u201fs famous dictum that \u201elife is the sum of \nall activities that resist death\u201f. \n \n  \n14 October 2008: 21 \nNotes \n \n1 Significantly, the offer was withdrawn in the wake of the court litigation between Hayflick and the National Institutes of Health over the \nownership of the WI-38 somatic cell line, long before the question of legal ownership over living materials was settled by the United \nStates Supreme Court (see Jaffe, 1990; Rattan, 2000). From this perspective, Hayflick might also be said to have contributed very \nimportantly to the contemporary reorganisation of the political economy of the biomedical sciences. \n  \n14 October 2008: 22 \nBibliography \nAlter, George & Charmichael, Ann (1997) \u201eSpecial issue: Reflections on the classification of causes of death\u201f, Continuity and \nChange, 12.2: 169-173  \nAri\u00e9s, Philippe (1987 [1977]) Hours of Our Death.
