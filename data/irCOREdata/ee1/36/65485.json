As we begin Volume 2, we \nthought it appropriate to celebrate our success, including taking stock of the \ncontent so far, the work that has been accomplished to achieve this and \npossible themes for future issues.   \n \nWe would like to thank all those who have contributed through work on the \neditorial and advisory boards, refereeing articles and, above all, writing for the \nearly issues of the journal.  It is a leap of faith to submit the fruits of hard \nintellectual labour to a new and untested journal, and we are grateful to those \nwho were willing to do this before ever seeing a published copy. We hope we \nhave done justice to these contributions and that they form a firm foundation \nfor developing the journal into its second year of publication and beyond. The \nfact that people have been able and willing to write for the journal suggests \nthat its theme \u2013 Ethics and Social Welfare \u2013 provides a focus for reflection, \ntheorising and questioning that has both relevance and currency in the \npresent academic, policy and practice climates.  \n 2 \n \nTaking stock \n \nIn our editorial at the start of the first issue (Banks, Clifford, Bisman & \nPreston-Shoot, 2007) we invited contributions taking a range of approaches, \nof which we listed five possibilities. The aim of making such a categorisation \nwas to encourage a variety of different articles and to outline the terrain we \nfelt the journal might cover; it also served as a kind of \u2018stock-taking\u2019 of the \nstate of the field of \u2018ethics and social welfare\u2019 and an optimistic prediction \nabout the kinds of contributions we might receive. We will now consider what \nprogress the journal has made in relation to the five types of possible \ncontributions we identified earlier: moral philosophical theorising; analysis of \nkey ethical concepts; exploration of contested areas of policy and practice; \nempirical studies of living conditions, perceptions, attitudes and professional \ninterventions; and accounts of ethical issues in practice. We have also added \ntwo further categories to our original list to reflect the content of the first four \nissues: ethical issues in research; and models of professional ethical decision-\nmaking.   \n \n1. Moral philosophical theorising relevant to matters of social welfare, for \nexample, the evaluation and development of theoretical approaches to \nethics such as those based on virtue, duty, consequences, care, \ncommunity or major world religions. \n \nSeveral articles have focussed on an ethical theory or theoretical \napproach, developed it and suggested applications to our understanding of \nprofessional practice, mainly in the social work field. In this issue, for \nexample, Thompson sketches out some of the main features of \nexistentialist ethics, drawing particularly on the thinking of Nietzsche and \nSartre, linking these to contemporary social work concerns. This leads to \nexploring the value of an \u2018ethics of uncertainty\u2019, involving a fluid approach, \ntailored to specific circumstances; an approach to ethics that is firmly \nlinked with politics; and an ethics of empowerment (drawing on \nNietzsche\u2019s concept of \u2018self-overcoming\u2019 and Sartre\u2019s emphasis on \nfreedom and authenticity). In the previous issue, Gray and Lovat (2007) \nalso focus on ethics in social work, but they argue for virtue ethics as an \nalternative to what they see as \u2018rule-bound\u2019 deontological and utilitarian \nconsequentialist approaches to ethics. They link virtue ethics with \nHabermas\u2019s discourse ethics, seeing his consensus-seeking procedures \nfor communicative action as a project to create conditions for human \nflourishing. Their version of virtue ethics, offers, they argue, a \u2018stance\u2019 for \nsocial work to deal with intractable moral conflicts in an increasingly \nuncertain world. While Graham (2007), in issue number 2, offers a new \nanalysis of the ethics of care from a black women\u2019s perspective, thus \nchallenging the feminist ethics of care to take account of the gendered \ndimensions of racism that are an integral part of black women\u2019s lived \nexperiences. Graham outlines an African-centred ethics of care, drawing \non the ethical philosophies and principles of Ma\u2019at  (an ancient \nphilosophical and spiritual knowledge system based on key values of \ninterrelatedness, interdependence and interconnectedness) and outlining \n 3 \nthe implications of these new perspectives for the giving and receiving of \ncare.   \n \nAll three of these articles explore theoretical approaches to ethics that take \naccount of context, the moral qualities of the agent and the nature of \nrelationships (existentialist ethics, virtue ethics and the ethics of care). This \nreflects the growing attention being paid in moral philosophy towards more \nsituated approaches to ethics, which are now also being applied to \nprofessional ethics. While there are some detailed accounts that develop \nthese ethical approaches in the context of social welfare policy and \npractice (for example, Graham, 2002; Sevenhuisen, 1998; Thompson, \n1992), there is scope for more practice-based theorising to develop some \nof the ideas further, particularly in the social work and social care field.  \n \n   \n2. Exploration and analysis of key ethical concepts.  \n \nSeveral articles in previous issues have taken one or more core concepts \nin ethics or professional ethics, located them within relevant literature and \npractice situations, offered a conceptual analysis and given them a \nparticular gloss. In the first issue, Koggel (2007) offers an analysis of the \nconcepts of \u2018empowerment\u2019, \u2018advocacy\u2019 and globalisation\u2019 and then uses \nthese concepts in her critical examination of some of the recent work of \nthe World Bank, in contrast with the practice of a locally-based Indonesian \nNGO undertaking empowerment work. Clark (2007) examines \n\u2018professional responsibility\u2019, \u2018misconduct\u2019 and \u2018practical reason\u2019, taking as \nhis starting point a report of a case of the death of a child. He suggests \nthat the failures in professional conduct and responsibility can be \nunderstood as failures of practical reason. Finally Beckett (2007) explores \n\u2018realism\u2019 as an ethical obligation in social work \u2013 alluding to some of the \nspecialist philosophical meanings of the term (realism versus idealism in \ntheory of knowledge, for example), while mainly working with several \nordinary language uses of the term (realism versus rhetoric; realism \nversus optimism; realism versus impracticality; realism versus \nexaggeration; realism versus simplicity; realism versus pretence), arguing \nthat social workers should be \u2018realistic\u2019 in all of these senses about the \nprocess and outcomes of their work..  \n \nThe focus on one or more key concepts does not necessarily commit the \nauthors to an ethical theory or theoretical approach. It is a useful \ncontribution to developing our thinking about the meaning of many of the \nfrequently used concepts of ethical significance in policy and practice that \nare often used loosely, carelessly or inconsistently. There is a need for \nmore careful and stimulating work of this kind, using the skills and insights \nof good philosophical analysis, alongside detailed illustrative examples \nfrom actual policy and practice (as opposed to the hypothetical examples \nso beloved of philosophers).  Further practice-based contributions that \nexplore concepts such as human flourishing, human capabilities, social \nwelfare and social justice would be welcomed in future issues. \n \n 4 \n3. Exploration of problematic and contested areas of public policy or \nprofessional practice with a focus on the ethical issues involved.  \n \nParrott\u2019s article in this issue falls into this category. He discusses the \ncurrent stress in British social policy on partnership working and the ethical \nissues this raises for practitioners from different professions who need to \ncommunicate, understand each other and work together. Interestingly, \nParrott identifies Habermas\u2019s theory of communicative action as a model \nfor encouraging consensus-seeking dialogue between partners in health \nand social care work.  In the first issue, Munroe (2007) examines trends in \nBritish child welfare policy to take power away from families and shift it \ntowards the state and professional decision-making, considering the \nimplications of this move for professional confidentiality. While MacDonald \n(2007) considers the impact of the British Human Rights Act (1998) on \ndecision-making in adult social care, Buchanan and Gunn (2007), in issue \n2, examine the challenges and opportunities for a rights-based approach \nin the context of services for children and for parents with learning \ndifficulties. Koggel\u2019s (2007) research on the implications of World Bank \npolicies also falls into this category of article with a focus on contested \nareas of policy and practice.  \n \nFurther contributions would be welcomed on developments in social \npolicy, especially comparative studies and discussions of international and \nglobal policy trends, with a clear focus on the ethical dimensions. Themes \nmight range from examination of the impact of managerialist regimes on \nprofessional ethics, to the implications of international agreements on \nclimate change for communities in different parts of the globe. \n    \n4. Empirical studies of aspects of people\u2019s living conditions; perceptions and \nattitudes of the public, service users, professionals, policy makers; \nprofessional interventions that have a focus on social welfare and ethical \nissues.    \n \nThis category of article is the most popular so far, with seven articles \nfocusing on reporting empirical research. In this issue, Whiting reports on \nhis research on religious values in social work organisations. Earlier issues \nfeatured the results of McLaren\u2019s (2007) research on social workers\u2019 \nattitudes towards and handling of the issue of forewarning service users \nabout the limits to confidentiality in suspected child abuse cases; Jawad\u2019s \n(2007) study of some of the ethical features of social welfare regimes in \nLebanon; Mantle (2007) on tensions in the family court between the \nprotection and empowerment of children; Charnley (2007) on the roles and \nperformance of international NGOs working with children separated from \ntheir families by war in Mozambique; and Bradford\u2019s (2007) historical \nresearch on concepts of the \u2018good youth worker\u2019 in England during the \nperiod 1939-45.   \n \nWe particularly welcome empirical studies of this kind and hope that the \ndeveloping theoretical and conceptual analyses found in other articles in \nthe journal will assist in developing more nuanced and detailed ethical \n 5 \nframeworks that can be used and further developed in empirical research. \nThe inter-relationship between empirical research, moral philosophical \nanalysis and theoretical ethics is another sub-theme that is of growing \ninterest in both philosophical and practice-based literature on ethics and \nbears further development.  \n \n5. Accounts of practice or personal experience from social welfare \npractitioners and service users that identify ethical concerns and \ndilemmas.     \n \nThis category of writing has mainly appeared in the \u2018ethical issues in \npractice\u2019 section of the journal, which, if we include this issue, has so far \nfeatured 16 shorter articles contributed by people in the roles of student, \nservice user, carer, social work and youth work practitioner, teacher and \nacademic. This section is providing a rich selection of accounts of ethical \nissues in practice, ranging from Ward\u2019s account of the ethics of secret \nfilming in this issue, to the experience of mental health recovery in volume \n1, issue 2 (Fox, 2007). The reflective and often very honest style of these \npieces is thought-provoking and can be regarded as part of an ongoing \nprocess of collecting and reflecting on cases and accounts that is at the \nvery heart of the ethics of practice (whether that be professional practice \nor the practice of ordinary life).  \n \nWe invite further reflective accounts of ethical issues in practice, which \ntake the form of a description of an issue, situation or case and some \nreflections on the ethical implications. For these kinds of pieces, we do not \nnecessarily require references to academic or professional literature. We \nare more concerned with authentic accounts of experiences; and our \npractice editors are willing to work with people who wish to contribute to \nthis section of the journal. We are particularly keen to encourage service \nusers and carers to write for the journal; and we hope the Jo Campling \nMemorial Prize being offered by the journal for a student essay (see p. X) \nwill encourage contributions from students.   \n \n6. Reflecting on ethical issues in research  \n \nThis was a category we did not list separately in our first editorial, but it is \nclearly a topical and emerging theme across all disciplines, with practice-\nbased research conducted by academics with a professional background \nin social welfare work providing particularly interesting issues for \ndiscussion. Research ethics is an area of on-going concern and interest, \nas awareness has increased of the need to protect research participants \nfrom harm and to ensure the integrity of research processes and \noutcomes. We have seen a mushrooming of regulations, guidelines and \nprocedures, and their policing by research ethics committees. These \nregulatory processes, which are developing across many parts of the \nworld, provide opportunities for the study of the principles and practices of \nresearch governance and the challenges these pose for researchers, as \nreported by Part and Comben (2007) in their contribution to first issue of \nthe journal on social work research in a British health care setting. The \n 6 \ndemand for detailed specifications of research designs in advance, and a \nlack of familiarity of some committees with qualitative research, often \nmakes these procedures seem not only burdensome, but positively \nantithetical to flexible and participative social research.  \n \nSocial welfare practitioners and academics have particular interests and \nsensitivities in conducting research with service users, seeing ethics in \nresearch as needing to mirror ethics in practice \u2013 with further \ncomplications, especially if the approach is participative and action-\noriented, or if the participants are particularly vulnerable. Munford et al in \nthis issue give an account of the carefully planned and ethically sensitive \napproach they took to a qualitative study of the parenting experiences of \nparents with an intellectual disability. Their account demonstrates the \nimportance of thinking through the ethical issues raised in any piece of \nresearch, and what can be done to ensure that research participants are \nvalued and empowered during and as a result of the research process. In \nthe second issue of the journal, McLaughlin (2007) discusses some of the \nethical issues in involving young service users as co-researchers, showing \nhow similar issues arise in participative research (respect, power-sharing, \nhonesty, informed consent) as in practice with young people. We have no \ndoubt that reflection on the ethics of social research will be the subject of \nfuture articles, particularly as academics in the social welfare field are \nincreasingly undertaking practice-based research. \n \n7. Developing models for ethical practice or ethical decision-making \n \nThe development of ethical decision-making models is another theme that \nwe did not identify on our original list of different types of contribution to \nthe journal. In professional ethics, the development of models to help \npractitioners make difficult ethical decisions has been quite popular, with a \nnumber having been developed for social work and related professions. \nThese usually appear in textbooks, and outline several steps to be taken \nor stages to be accomplished involving gaining relevant information, \nthinking through issues and priorities with reference to principles in \nprofessional codes or ethical theories and rehearsing outcomes or \nconsequences. McAuliffe and Chenoweth, in this issue, review some of \nthese models, before presenting their own \u2018Inclusive Model of Ethical \nDecision-Making\u2019 for social work. This model rests on four key \u2018platforms\u2019: \naccountability; consultation; cultural sensitivity; and critical reflection, and \nuses a dynamic five-step reflective process to identify and analyse \u2018all \nrelevant aspects of an ethical dilemma\u2019.  \n \nWhilst ethical decision-making models often seem mechanistic and \nartificial - more suited for use in the classroom than the home, street or \nsocial care institution - they do help raise awareness of the myriad of \nfactors and perspectives involved in any professional decision. Classroom \nrehearsals involving systematic analyses of ethical problems and \ndilemmas can help improve ethical reasoning and hence decision-making \nin practice. The development of new critical models is important: models \nthat move beyond simplistic, rational deductive accounts of moral \n 7 \nreasoning; that take account of the co-construction of issues and \nproblems; that leave room for emotional and culturally sensitive \nresponses; and encourage reflexivity on the part of professionals to see \nthemselves as engaged participants rather than neutral and impartial \ndecision-makers. It is likely that in future there will be a continuation of this \ntrend towards the development of less structured and more discursive and \nparticipative models of communication and decision-making between \nservice users and professionals, with a focus on narratives and stories, for \nexample.  \n \nConclusions: where next? \n \nLooking ahead over the next few years, we hope to attract a range of articles \nthat build on and develop these themes, and some that surprise us and take \nus in new directions. Above all, we hope to generate ideas, debate and \nenthusiasm for this rather specialised, yet at the same time, all-embracing \nfield of Ethics and Social Welfare. \n \nAs noted in the editorial in the first issue, we deliberately chose the rather \nbroad title, Ethics and Social Welfare, to ensure our focus went beyond simply \nsocial work and the other social professions operating in the community, \nyouth, caring and social pedagogical fields. Ethics as a practice and as a \ndiscipline (subject of study) can never be divorced from politics. In future \nissues we hope to feature more of the ongoing ethico-political debates about \nthe nature of human welfare or well-being; the role of the state, voluntary and \nnon-governmental organisations, communities and families in caring for \nindividuals and groups experiencing vulnerability or crises; the implications of \nincreased voluntary and forced migration; debates about cultural relativism; \nand controversial public policies for social inclusion and exclusion. We hope, \ntherefore, to include contributions that address issues in political philosophy, \npublic and social policy.  \n \nTeaching and learning about ethics in professional and academic educational \ncontexts is another area that could be further developed. As professional \nethics grows as a discipline in its own right, then we might expect further more \ndetailed studies of and guides to learning and teaching about professional \nethics in the social welfare professions. Similarly, as interest in \u2018applied ethics\u2019 \ngrows rapidly, so do new ways of teaching and learning in \u2018academic\u2019 subject \nareas such as moral and political philosophy and theology.  \n \nEthics in the management of professional practice, as well as the \nmanagement and distribution of scarce resources at regional, national and \nglobal levels, are all areas where further thinking and empirical research will \nbe useful. We invite you, therefore, to join us in reading and reflecting on the \narticles presented in this issue, and to consider making a contribution yourself \nin the future. We are particularly keen to encourage contributions from \ndifferent parts of the world \u2013 to go beyond an Anglo-American-Australasian \nfocus and to engage with scholars and practitioners in Africa, Asia, Central \nand South America and other parts of Europe. We recognise that in many \nparts of the world \u2018ethics\u2019 is conceived of differently, and may be conceptually \n 8 \ninseparable from religion, culture or politics. We need articles that engage \nwith these issues, that may even challenge the applicability and usefulness of \nthe very concept of \u2018ethics\u2019 itself and that consider the possibilities and \ndifficulties of global dialogues on the theme of \u2018ethics.  \n \nWe appreciate the difficulties of writing in English and are prepared to offer \nsupport for authors who first language is not English. We also urge all \ncontributors to situate their articles, where relevant, in their particular national, \ncultural and policy contexts, and not to assume that their own familiar \npractices and ideas are equally familiar to readers in other parts of the globe. \nWhile we expect accounts of practice, empirical research and contested areas \nof policy to be specific to a place, time and way of thinking, as far as possible \nwe hope the analyses offered may go beyond merely local or parochial \nconcerns.  \n \nReferences \n \n \nBanks, S., Clifford, D., Bisman, C. and Preston-Shoot, M.
