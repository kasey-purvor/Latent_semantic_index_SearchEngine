Some of the \nmain advantages of using a laser for materials processing are: \n \n\u2022 Relative cleanliness. \n\u2022 Accurate processing. \no Allows much control over the Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) due to the ability of \nrelative precise control over the thermal profile and thermal \npenetration\/absorption. \n\u2022 Precise placement of the beam onto the target material allowing user specified areas of \nthe target material to be processed. \n\u2022 Post-processing techniques required are usually minimal. \n\u2022 Non-contact processing. \n\u2022 Automation (repeatability) of the various processing techniques using a laser is relatively \neasy to implement. \n  \nWith a large number of different lasers now commercially available it is possible for one to deduce \nthat almost all materials can be processed using a laser due to the wide range of laser parameters \nthat can be utilized. With the many benefits of using lasers for materials processing it has been \nfound that the interest in laser-induced surface treatment has grown, especially within the \nbiomedical industry. This is due to the fact that lasers offer the user a highly selective, rapid \ntechnique to induce surface modification in both organic and inorganic materials [5].  \n \nIn order to modify the surface properties of polymers for use in biological environments and \nenhance the cell response by improving upon the adhesion characteristics, a vast number of \ntechniques and methods have been developed. These techniques range from surface topography \nmodification [6-8] to surface chemistry modification [9-11] and have given rise to the increased \ninterest in using polymers as biomaterials [12-19]. Nylon 6,6, the strongest and most abrasive \nresistant unreinforced nylon, has been used for such biological applications as sutures, tracheal \ntubes and gastrointestinal segments [20]. With regards to orthopedic applications it can be seen \nthat nylon is not commonly employed due to the hygroscopic nature having a large affect on the \nmechanical properties over long periods of time [21]. Having said that, the use of nylon 6,6 within \nthis work gives high value experimentally insofar as to ascertain generic factors for polymeric \nmaterials which could be used to predict the osteoblast cell response. Also, by modifying the \nsurface of polymeric materials it may be possible to identify other biological applications as this \nmay enhance the osteoblast cell response and biocompatibile properties. On account of nylon 6,6 \nbeing a relatively inexpensive polymer when compared to other polymer types, by identifying \nother applications for this material the biological industry would benefit by being able to \nimplement cheaper, more economic bio-implant materials. \n \nWith numerous advances in medicine it has been seen that the population is ageing both within the \nU.K. and within other major countries around the world. On account of people living longer, a \nnumber of institutions have developed a focus on bioengineering to meet the ever growing \ndemands on medical facilities [22]. Furthermore, it is possible for one to realize that with an \nageing population there is an ever increasing demand for biological implants. As a result, these \nneeds of the ageing population need to be met more economically and efficiently so that costs and \nthe need for unnecessary surgery are considerably reduced. Therefore, it is imperative for the \nbiomedical industry to devise a way to manufacture cheap implants which can be used in \nconfidence to ensure a dramatic reduction in failure rates. This can be met by the laser surface \ntreatment of polymeric materials to enhance their biomimetic properties.  \n \nOn account of the many benefits offered by laser materials processing to life sciences this paper is \na contribution to the endeavour of enhancing polymer surface properties to determine generic \nparameters which give rise to the level of biofunctionality. That is, this work undertakes an \napproach by which the laser modified surface parameters, wettability characteristics and osteoblast \ncell response are discussed in order to ascertain the variables which link the factors together as \nshown in Figure 1.   \n    \n3.0 \u2013 Experimental Technique \n3.1 \u2013 Nylon 6,6 Material \n \nThe nylon 6,6 (Tm: 255\u00b0, \u03c1: 1.3 gcm-3) was sourced in 100 mm2 sheets with a thickness of 5 mm \n(Goodfellow Cambridge, Ltd). To obtain a conveniently sized sample for experimentation the as-\nreceived nylon sheet was cut into 20 mm diameter discs using a 1 kW continuous wave (cw) CO2 \nlaser (Everlase S48; Coherent, Ltd). No discernible heat affected zone (HAZ) was observed under \noptical microscopic examination. \n \n3.2 \u2013 KrF Excimer Laser-Induced Patterning  \n \nFor the patterned experiments the repetition rate of the KrF excimer laser (LPX 200i; Lambda \nPhysik, Inc.) was kept constant at 25 Hz, with a number of 10 pulses per site and used Aerotech \nCNC programming to induce the required pattern.  A constant laser energy of 80\u00b17 mJ was used \nwith the attenuator set to 0.3 (30%) giving a measured energy at the target sample of \n23.67\u00b12.5 mJ, resulting in a fluence of 858\u00b191 mJ\/cm2. In order to induce the intended pattern a \nprojection imaging system was implemented with a focusing lens of x10 demagnification. The \npatterns induced using this technique were 50 \u03bcm trench (ET50), 100 \u03bcm trench (ET100), 50 \u03bcm \nhatch (EH50 ) and 100 \u03bcm (EH100). Two non-contact masks were used for both dimensioned \npatterns which included a brass mask with six 1 mm diameter holes spaced by 2 mm, centre to \ncentre, for the 100 \u03bcm dimensions and a SS316 foil (Laser Micromachining Ltd., UK) with five \n0.5 mm diameter holes spaced by 1.5 mm, \u2018centre to centre\u2019, for the 50 \u03bcm dimensions. To keep \nthe constant 10 pulses per site it should also be noted here that scanning velocities of 0.125 mms-1 \nand 0.25 mms-1 were used for the 50 \u00b5m and 100 \u00b5m dimensioned patterns, respectively. \n No processing gases were used throughout the experimentation and all laser processing was \ncarried out in an enclosure in which the ambient gas was air. Also, for all laser processing no \nhomogenizer was implemented meaning that the raw beam was used which would have given rise \nto energy spikes pulse to pulse, having some possible affect on the incident laser fluence and laser \nmaterial processing. \n  \n3.3 \u2013KrF Excimer Laser Whole Area Irradiative Processing  \n \nFor the whole area processing with the KrF excimer laser (LPX 200i; Lambda Physik, Inc.) the \nraw 23 \u00d7 12 mm2 beam was used to irradiate a large section of each sample at a time. In order to \nhold the sample normal to the beam a bracket on the optical train was used. For the large area \nprocessing experiments 6 samples where studied; these being 100 pulses at 100 mJ (EWA100), \n100 pulses at 150 mJ (EWA150), 100 pulses at 200 mJ (EWA200), 100 pulses at 250 mJ \n(EWA250), 500 pulses at 250 mJ (EWA250_500) and 1000 pulses at 250 mJ (EWA250_1000). \nThis gave fluences of 36\u00b13, 54\u00b15, 72\u00b18 and 91\u00b110 mJ\/cm2, respectively for the different energies \nused.  Throughout the whole area excimer experiments the repetition rate was kept constant at \n25 Hz and Aerotech CNC programming ensured that the correct number of pulses was applied to \neach sample. \n \n3.4 \u2013 Topography, Wettability Characteristics and Surface Chemistry Analysis \n \nAfter laser irradiation the nylon 6,6 samples were analysed using a number of techniques. The \nsurface profiles were determined using a white light interferometer (WLI) (NewView 500; Zygo, \nLtd) with MetroPro and TalyMap Gold Software. The WLI was set-up using a \u00d710 Mirau lens \nwith a zoom of \u00d70.5 and working distance of 7.6 mm. This system also allowed Sa and Ra \nroughness parameters to be determined for each sample. Where Ra can be defined as the arithmetic \naverage of the absolute values along a single specified direction and Sa the arithmetic average of \nthe absolute values over the whole of the laser surface treated area. \n \nIn accordance with the procedure detailed by Rance [23] the samples were ultrasonically cleaned \nin isoproponal (Fisher Scientific Ltd.) for 3 minutes at room temperature before using a sessile \ndrop device to determine various wettability characteristics. This was to allow for a relatively clean \nsurface prior to any contact angle, \u03b8, measurements being taken. To ensure that the sample \nsurfaces were dry a specimen dryer (Metaserv, Ltd.) was employed to blow ambient air across the \nsamples. A sessile drop device (OCA20; Dataphysics Instruments, GmbH) was used with relevant \nsoftware (SCA20; Dataphysics Intrsuments, GmbH) to allow the recent advancing and receding \u03b8 \nfor triply distilled water and the recent advancing angle for diiodomethane to be determined for \neach sample. By starting with a droplet with a volume of 8 \u00b5l then the advancing \u03b8 were achieved \nby adding and removing 0.5 \u00b5l, respectively, for each measurement. Thereafter the advancing \u03b8 for \nthe two liquids were used by the software to draw an OWRK plot to determine the surface energy \nof the samples. For the two reference liquids the SCA20 software used the Str\u00f6m et al technique \n(triply distilled water \u2013 SFT(total:72.80), SFT(D:21.80), SFT(P:51.00); diiodomethane \u2013 \nSFT(total:50.80), SFT(D:50.80), SFT(P:0.00)) to calculate the surface energy of the material. It \nshould be noted here that ten \u03b8, using two droplets in each instance, were recorded to achieve a \nmean \u03b8 for each liquid and surface.   \n \nAll samples were analysed using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). This allowed any \nsurface modifications in terms of surface oxygen content due to the laser irradiation to be revealed. \nFurther details on XPS measurements of surface oxygen content have been stated previously [24].  \n \n3.5 \u2013 In Vitro Experimentation \n \nPrior to any biological testing being carried out the samples were autoclaved (D-Series Bench-Top \nAutoclave; Systec, GmbH) to ensure that all samples were sterilized. For all biological work \nundertaken, unless stated, a biological safety cabinet (BSC) (Microflow Class II ABS Cabinet; \nBioQuell UK, Ltd) was used to create a safe working environment and to provide a clean, sterile \nenvironment to manipulate the cells used. \n \nNormal human osteoblast cells (Clonetics CC-2538; Lonza, Inc.) were initially cultured in a T75 \n(75 ml) flask by suspending the cells in 19 ml culture medium comprising of 90% eagle minimum \nessential medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Ltd., UK) and 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma-Aldrich \nLtd., UK). The flask was then placed in an incubator and left for 24 hrs. After 24 hrs the cells were \nassessed and the spent media was aspirated before dispensing 15 ml of fresh media and returning \nthe flask to the incubator for three days.  \n \nThe period of three days allowed the cells to become confluent in the flask providing enough cells \nfor seeding onto the samples. The cells were detached from the flask using 5 ml Trypsin-EDTA \n(Sigma-Aldrich Ltd., UK) whilst placed in the incubator for seven minutes. Once all cells had \nbecome detached 10 ml culture medium was added to neutralize the Trypsin. In order to aspirate \nthe supernatant the cell culture was centrifuged (U-320R; Boeco, GmbH) for five minutes at 200 g. \nTo ensure the cells were ready for seeding they were resuspended in 10 ml of culture medium and \ndispensed between the samples in the 6-well plates. This equated to 0.55 ml (2\u00d7104 cells\/ml) for \neach sample. The well plates were then placed in the incubator for a set time. One plate was \nremoved after 24 hrs and two other plates after four days. A well plate after 24 hrs and 4 days was \nprepared for the SEM as will be discussed later and the other plate, removed after 4 days, was \nprepared for counting using an improved neubauer hemacytometer (Fisher Scientific Ltd., UK) by \nmixing 10 \u03bcl of each cell suspension with 10 \u03bcl of trypan-blue (Sigma-Aldrich Ltd., UK). In order \nto harvest the cells for counting the cells were detached from the samples using 2 ml Trypsin-\nEDTA (Sigma-Aldrich Ltd., UK) whilst placed in the incubator for seven minutes. Once all cells \nhad become detached 4 ml culture medium was added to neutralize the Trypsin. In order to \naspirate the supernatant the cell culture was centrifuged (U-320R; Boeco, GmbH) for five minutes \nat 200 g. To ensure the cells were ready for counting they were resuspended in 2 ml of culture \nmedium and 2 ml of the trypan-blue was added. \n \n3.6 \u2013 Scanning Electron Microscopy and Cell Cover Density of In Vitro Samples \n  \nIn order to view the attached cells using SEM it was necessary to undertake a procedure to produce \na sample that was dehydrated ready for Au coating. The samples were initially rinsed with \nphosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) to remove any unattached cells and then \nadherent cells were fixed using 1.2% glutaraldehyde in water (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) at room \ntemperature for one hour within the BSC. After an hour the glutaraldehyde solution was removed \nand the fixed cells were washed with PBS prior to carrying out a graded series of ethanol\/distilled \nwater mixtures of 50\/50, 80\/20, 90\/10, 95\/5, 98\/2 and 100\/0. Each sample was left in these \nmixtures for 10 min to ensure dehydration. Once this procedure was carried out, the samples were \nmounted and sputter coated with Au so that SEM micrographs could be obtained. In order to \nproduce the best images possible each image was manipulated in terms of brightness, contrast and \ngamma by using ImagePro Version 5.0.0.39 for Windows XP\/Professional software (Media \nCybernetics Inc., USA).  \n \nIn addition to the cell count described in Section 3.5, the cell cover density was determined \nfollowing both 24 hrs and 4 day incubation. This was done by analysing the cell coverage on each \nsample using SEM and optical micrographs with the ImagePro software. The optical micrographs \nwere obtained using an up-right optical microscope (Flash 200 Smartscope; OGP, Ltd) with \nmagnifications varying between \u00d720 and \u00d7100. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4.0 \u2013 Results and Discussion \n4.1 - Topography \n4.1.1 \u2013 KrF Excimer Laser-Induced Patterning \n \nIt can be seen in Figure 2 that the topography of the nylon 6,6 had been modified significantly through \nexcimer laser patterning when compared to the as-received sample (see Figure 2(a)). For the 50 \u00b5m \ndimensioned patterns (see Figure 2(b) and Figure 2(d)) trench depths of around 1.5 \u00b5m was obtained \nfrom the employed laser processing parameters. These constant laser processing parameters also gave \nrise to trench depths of roughly 4 to 5 \u00b5m for the 100 \u00b5m dimensioned patterned samples (see Figure \n2(c) and Figure 2(e)). What is more, on account of the accuracy and precision of the excimer laser \nsystem implemented, the trenches produced in the nylon 6,6 materials which can be seen in Figures \n2(b) to (e) were highly periodic. This periodicity was also confirmed upon obtaining the profile \nextractions as shown in Figures 2(b) to (e). \n \nTable 1 gives the surface roughness values for each of the KrF excimer laser-induced patterned \nsamples and shows that the surface roughness had dramatically increased for the excimer laser \npatterned samples. For instance, the largest increases were seen with the 100 \u00b5m dimensioned patterns \nwhich had an Sa of approximately 1.5 \u00b5m. This can be seen to be on account of the fact that the \n100 \u00b5m dimensioned patterned samples gave rise to deeper trenches in comparison to the 50 \u00b5m \ndimensioned samples. \n \n4.1.2 \u2013 KrF Excimer Laser Whole Area Irradiative Processing \n \nThrough WLI it was found that the KrF excimer laser whole area irradiative processed samples (see \nFigure 3) appeared to have a similar topography to that of the as-received sample (see Figure 2(a)). \nThis can be attributed to the fact that the whole sample was irradiated meaning that any ablation \ntaking place would remove a somewhat uniform layer from the surface of the nylon 6,6. On the other \nhand, especially for the samples with low incident fluences, it may be possible that the material did \nnot ablate on account of the threshold fluence not being achieved. \n \nWith regards to surface roughness the whole area irradiated samples had roughnesses equivalent to \nthat of the as-received sample (AR) which had an Sa of 0.126 \u00b5m and an Ra of 0.029 \u00b5m (see Table \n1). This can be accounted for by the observation through the WLI which showed a negligible effect on \nthe surface topography for these samples. This further confirms that the fluences implemented for \nthese samples was not sufficient to elicit an ablative response from the nylon 6,6 samples. Having said \nthat, it may still have been possible for surface chemistry changes to occur due to oxidation. This is on \naccount of the fact that directly after the irradiation of the samples using the KrF excimer laser, the \nsamples were warm to the touch, with the warmest sample being WA250_1000 which had \n1000 pulses and the highest fluence of 91 mJcm-2. \n \n4.2 \u2013 Wettability and Surface Oxygen Content \n4.2.1 \u2013 KrF Excimer Laser-Induced Patterning \n \nTable 1 gives a summary of the surface parameters and wettability characteristics for each of the \nsamples studied. On account of the KrF excimer laser-induced patterning of the nylon 6,6 samples \u03b8 \nincreased by up to 24\u00b0 in comparison to the as-received sample (AR) which had a \u03b8 of 56.4\u00b11.2\u00b0. This \ndid not appear to corroborate with current theory as an increase in surface roughness for a hydrophilic \nmaterial should bring about a reduction in \u03b8 [5]. This increase in \u03b8 arising from the excimer patterned \nsamples can be accounted for by the reduction in apparent polar component, \u03b3P, and apparent total \nsurface free energy, \u03b3T, which is modified by the liquids equilibrium state. That is, the wetting regime \nhad changed on account of the surface topography with the likelihood being that the transition was to \na mixed-state wetting regime in which both Wenzel and Cassie-Baxter regimes formed along the \nliquid-surface interface [25-31]. It should also be noted here that Table 1 confirms that as a result of \nthe KrF excimer laser-material oxidation of the surface was observed, allowing the surface oxygen \ncontent to increase by at most 1.6 %at. The largest increase in surface oxygen content was found to be \nfrom the hatch patterned samples (EH50 and EH100) owed to the fact that more material was ablated \ninducing more surface oxidation. \n \nFrom Figure 4 it can be seen that \u03b8 was an inverse function of \u03b3P (see Figure 4(a)) and \u03b3T (see Figure \n4(b) which does agree with current theory for a hydrophilic material such as nylon 6,6. This suggests \nthat even though there is a likely-hood of a mixed-state wetting regime is arising on the KrF excimer \nlaser patterned samples \u03b3P and \u03b3T still play a distinct role in terms of the wettability of the nylon 6,6. It \nis also possible to ascertain from Figure 4(b) that similar values of \u03b3T give rise to equivalent values of \n\u03b8. That is, with a \u03b3T of approximately 30 mJm-2, a \u03b8 of between 75 and 80\u00b0 could be expected.      \n \nFigure 5 shows the correlation arising between \u03b8 and the surface roughness parameters Ra and Sa. For \nthe KrF excimer laser-induced patterned samples it can be seen that \u03b8 is an increasing function of both \nRa and Sa with the exception of the last data point which was for sample EH100 which had an Ra of \n1.032 \u00b5m, an Sa of 1.530 \u00b5m and a resulting \u03b8 of 73\u00b13.7\u00b0. This could suggest that an increase in the \nsurface roughness gives rise to an increase in \u03b8 until a certain point at which \u03b8 remains constant or \nbegins to decrease by which time would then start to correspond with current theory insofar as an \nincrease in surface roughness gives rise to a more hydrophilic response [5]. Furthermore, this could \nsuggest that over the different rough periodic surfaces a transition in wetting regime could have taken \nplace and would explain the decrease in \u03b8 for the roughest sample (sample EH100).    \n4.2.2 \u2013 KrF Excimer Laser Whole Area Irradiative Processing \n \nFrom Table 1 it can be seen that the KrF excimer laser whole area irradiated samples gave rise to a \ndecrease in \u03b8 of up to 20\u00b0. The largest decrease in \u03b8 was observed for samples WA250_500 and \nWA250_1000 which had the largest fluence of 91 mJm-2 and more pulses compared to the other \nsamples. The reduction observed in \u03b8 can be attributed to the increase in \u03b3P and \u03b3T. In terms of surface \noxygen content it was seen that there was an increase of up to 5 %at. which could have also given rise \nto the reduction in \u03b8. Another factor which can be taken from Table 1 is that the surface roughness \nvariation was negligible compared to the as-received sample (AR) which had an Ra of 0.029 \u00b5m and \nSa of 0.12 \u00b5m. Therefore, it stands to reason that \u03b3P and \u03b3T or the surface oxygen content in this \ninstance had to be the most dominant in determining the wettability of nylon 6,6 following KrF \nexcimer laser whole area irradiative processing.  \n \nFigure 4 shows that \u03b8 over all KrF excimer laser whole area processed samples was an inverse \nfunction of \u03b3P (see Figure 4(a)) and \u03b3T (see Figure 4(b) with very good correlation. What is more it can \nbe seen from Figure 4 that those samples which had equivalent \u03b3P or \u03b3T values gave rise to similar \nobserved \u03b8. For instance, for \u03b3P values of around 22 and 25 mJm-2, \u03b8 was approximately 51 and 48\u00b0 \n(see Figure 4(a)). Also, from Figure 4(b) it can be seen that samples with similar \u03b3T of around \n51 mJm-2 gave rise to \u03b8 in the region of 50\u00b0.   \n \nFigure 5 shows a reasonable inverse correlation between the surface roughness and \u03b8 for all KrF \nexcimer laser whole area irradiative processed samples. However, on account of the relatively small \nvariations in Ra and Sa for these samples, a conclusive relationship between surface roughness and \u03b8 \ncould not be determined. \n \n4.2.3 \u2013 Comparison Between KrF Excimer Laser-Induced Patterning and KrF Excimer Laser \nWhole Area Irradiative Processing \n \nTable 1 allows one to identify that there was some significant differences between the as-received \n(AR), KrF excimer laser-induced patterned and KrF excimer laser whole area processed nylon 6,6  \nsamples in terms of surface parameters and wettability characteristics. It was observed that for the \nKrF laser-induced patterned samples \u03b8 increased even though there was a significant increase in \nsurface roughness. This increase in \u03b8 can be attributed to the reduction in \u03b3P and \u03b3T and the likelihood \nof a transition in wetting regime. On the other hand, it was found that on account of an increase in \u03b3P \nand \u03b3T, \u03b8 decreased for the KrF excimer laser whole area irradiative processed nylon 6,6 samples. It \nwas observed that for all KrF excimer laser processed samples the surface oxygen content increased \nby up to 5 %at. when compared to the as-received sample (AR). This increase in surface oxygen \ncontent indicates that this may have given rise to the observed reduction in \u03b8 for the laser whole area \nprocessed samples. Still, this does not seem to be the case as a reduction in \u03b8 was not observed for the \nKrF excimer laser-induced patterned samples. This suggests that a significant variation in surface \ntopography of the nylon 6,6 may bring about the change in wettability regime; whereas when there is \nno significant variation in topography it is possible that a variation in wettability is brought about by \nother parameters such as \u03b3P and \u03b3T. In addition, even though there was a change in wetting regime for \nthe KrF excimer laser-induced patterned samples to account for the increase of Sa and Ra, it was still \nfound that \u03b8 remained strongly linked to variations in \u03b3P and \u03b3T. \n \nIn terms of collating the \u03b3P and \u03b3T results for the entire KrF excimer laser processed samples and \nthe effects thereof on \u03b8, Figure 4 shows that there was a strong inverse function correlation \nbetween \u03b8 and the surface energy parameters regardless of the processing technique used. This \nindicates that \u03b3P and \u03b3T could be the main driving parameters determining the wettability of the \nnylon 6,6 samples in this instance. As a result it may be possible to use these parameters as \nindicators of how nylon 6,6 will wet due to similar values of \u03b3P and \u03b3T giving rise to equivalent \u03b8, \nas discussed in Section 4.2.1 and Section 4.2.2.  \n \n4.3 \u2013 Osteoblast Cells: 24 hours Incubation \n4.3.1 \u2013 KrF Excimer Laser-Induced Patterning \n \nAfter 24 hrs incubation time for the osteoblast cell seeded samples it can be seen from the SEM \nmicrographs shown in Figure 6 that the cells had begun to adhere and proliferate across each of the \nKrF excimer laser-induced patterned nylon 6,6 samples. Similar to the as-received sample (see Figure \n6(a)) the KrF excimer laser-induced patterned samples gave rise to osteoblast cells with a bipolar cell \nmorpohology. In addition to this, one major difference between the cell growth on the as-received \nsample (see Figure 6(a)) and the KrF excimer laser-induced patterned samples is that the excimer \npatterned nylon 6,6 samples gave rise to some form of directionality; that is, the cells appeared to be \npreferentially growing along the grooves formed by the excimer laser. This could have been induced \nby the surface roughness and surface oxygen content being higher (see Table 1) in the etched grooves \nallowing for preferential cell growth. \n \nFigure 7 allows one to see that in terms of cell cover density, following 24 hrs of incubation, the KrF \nexcimer laser-induced patterned nylon 6,6 samples gave rise to a cell cover density equivalent to that \nobserved with the as-received sample (AR). That is, all of the KrF excimer laser-induced patterned \nsamples gave a cell cover density of around 20% suggesting that the nylon 6,6 surfaces had not given \nrise to a more enhanced osteoblast cell response following KrF excimer laser patterning.  \n \n4.3.2 \u2013 KrF Excimer Laser Whole Area Irradiative Processing \n \nFigure 8 shows the SEM micrographs for the KrF excimer laser whole area irradiative processed \nnylon 6,6 samples after 24 hrs incubation. From this it can be seen that the KrF excimer whole area \nirradiative processed samples gave rise to variations in cell morphology in comparison to the as-\nreceived sample (see Figure 6(a)) in that, the cells shown in Figure 8 appeared to be more clumped \nradial. This can be attributed to the fact that the combination of differing wettability characteristics \nand surface oxygen content is likely to have contributed to cell differentiation. As a result, one can \ndeduce that by modulating cell differentiation through varying wettability characteristics and surface \noxygen content there is a large potential for using laser surface treated polymeric materials within \nregenerative medicine.       \n \nIt is apparent from Figure 7 that all of the KrF excimer laser whole area irradiative processed samples \ngave rise to larger cell cover densities when compared to the as-received sample (AR) with the \nexception of sample EWA250_500 and sample EWA250_1000. The largest cover density of 25% was \nobtained with samples EWA100, EWA150, EWA250 and EWA250 which was 5% more than what \nwas observed for the as-received sample (AR). Sample EWA250_500 and sample EWA250_1000 \ngave rise to a reduction in osteoblast cell response (see Figure 7) and could be attributed to the \nsamples becoming too hydrophilic (see Table 1) in which the modified nylon 6,6 surfaces were not \nsufficient to promote an enhanced osteoblast cell response. That is, materials that are too hydrophilic \nare well known for their cell-repellant properties and hinder the initial protein adsorption needed for a \npositive cell response [18,32].  \n \n4.3.3 \u2013 Wettability Characteristics and Surface Parameters \n \nBy taking into account the effects of \u03b8 on the osteoblast cell response following 24 hrs incubation, it \ncan be seen that the data plotted in Figure 7 suggested a possible threshold window for \u03b8 between 47 \nand 53\u00b0 which gave rise to an enhanced osteoblast cell response in terms of cell cover density. On the \nother hand, this also indicates that above or below this \u03b8 threshold window the osteoblast cell \nresponse would inherently be hindered slowing the cell proliferation and reducing the cell cover \ndensity. Also, for the KrF excimer laser-induced patterned samples which gave rise to the largest \u03b8 of \napproximately 70 to 80\u00b0 it can be seen from Figure 7 that the cell cover density reduced to around \n18%. This is highly significant when compared to the other samples with \u03b8 between 47 and 53\u00b0 \nbecause these samples gave rise to the largest cell cover densities of 25% or more allowing one to \nextrapolate that a \u03b8 threshold window is likely. \n \nThe likelihood of a threshold window is further confirmed when accounting for \u03b3P and \u03b3T. Such that \nFigure 7 shows there was a \u03b3P threshold window of 17 to 25 mJm-2 and a window of 47 to 53 mJm-2 \nfor \u03b3T which gave rise to an enhanced osteoblast cell response in terms of cell cover density. It should \nalso be noted here that the relationship between the cell cover density, \u03b8 and \u03b3P are mostly the inverse \nto one another and can be attributed to the relationship between \u03b3P and \u03b8. From this the inverse \nrelationship for the two parameters with the cell cover density further attests to the relationship \nbetween \u03b8 and \u03b3P.  \n \nIt should noted here that Figure 7 also suggests that even though a threshold window could be \npossible, the KrF excimer laser-induced patterned nylon 6,6 samples did not conclusively follow the \ntrend. This is due to those samples with \u03b3T of around 30 mJm-2 giving rise to a variation of cell cover \ndensities ranging between 16 and 21%. This can be accounted for by the likelihood of a mixed-state \nwetting regime arising on these samples which would have had a large impact upon how the \nosteoblast cells reacted to the patterned nylon 6,6 surfaces.  \n \nIn addition, Figure 7 allows one to see that the cell cover density for the KrF laser processed samples \nafter 24 hrs of incubation was a decreasing function of the surface oxygen content such that the lowest \ncell cover densities of around 17% were achieved when the surface oxygen content had increased up \nto 18 %at. Having said that, it is well known that an increase in surface oxygen content should bring \nabout an enhanced cell response [5]. An explanation for this observed phenomena can be attributed to \na potential increase in surface toxicity whilst oxidation took place during the laser surface treatment. \nThis is on account of the nylon 6,6 potentially becoming excessively toxic through degradation of the \nnylon 6,6 surface giving rise to toxic substances which would hinder cell growth. Even though these \nsubstances may be present it is likely that surface oxidation would have taken place and would \nexplain the increase in surface oxygen content and reduction in cell count for the KrF excimer laser \nprocessed samples. This can be attributed to the fact that at the higher fluences further melting could \ncause the surface of the nylon 6,6 to become more toxic which would hinder cell growth compared to \nthe other samples. That is, upon considerable degradation of the nylon 6,6 it is known that toxic \nsubstances such as CO and HCN can evolve [33]. These evolved toxic substances could have been \npresent on the surface on account of the rapid heating and cooling, trapping these substances until \nthey leached out into the cell media. This would have had a considerable deleterious effect on the \nosteoblast cell growth as it has been shown that CO and HCN affect cell growth and proliferation \n[34]. \n \nFollowing 24 hrs of incubation it has been observed that \u03b8, \u03b3P, \u03b3T  and indirectly the surface oxygen \ncontent all had an influence on modulating the osteoblast cell response to the laser surface treated \nsamples. From the results obtained it was also found that there was no specific trend identified \nbetween the surface roughness and the osteoblast cell response following 24 hr incubation. This \nallows one to see that the surface roughness parameters were not a dominant parameter in determining \nthe osteoblast cell response. Also, on account of some erroneous results from the laser-induced \npatterned samples the laser whole area irradiative processed samples seemed to give rise to the highest \npotential for use in regenerative medicine. This is because of the likely mixed-state wetting regime \narising on the laser-induced patterned samples having a large impact upon the osteoblast cell \nresponse. \n \n4.4 \u2013 Osteoblast Cells: 4 Days Incubation \n4.4.1 \u2013 KrF Laser-Induced Patterning \n \nWith four days of incubation elapsed, Figure 9 shows that the cell growth was at an advanced stage \nfor the KrF excimer laser-induced patterned nylon 6,6 samples compared to what was observed \nfollowing 24 hrs incubation time (see Figure 6). From Figure 9 it can be seen that the cell morphology \nfor the as-received sample was radial and coral-like which differed from the KrF excimer laser-\ninduced patterned samples which gave a more clumped like morphology. It can also be identified \nusing Figure 9 that there appeared to be more directionality for the KrF excimer laser-induced \npatterned samples compared to the as-received sample. As discussed following 24 hrs incubation, this \ncould potentially be due to the grooves being rougher giving rise to more preferential cell growth in \nthese areas.  \n \nIt can be seen from Figure 10 that the KrF excimer laser-induced patterning of the nylon 6,6 samples \ngave rise to cover densities of just under 100% which was equivalent to that observed for the as-\nreceived sample (AR). To confirm if the bioactivity had changed for the KrF excimer laser-induced \npatterned samples compared to the as-received sample (AR) after four days of incubation cell count \nwas also taken into account. Figure 11 allows one to realize that the cell count was also equivalent to \nthat of the as-received sample which was around 40,000 cells\/ml. By knowing this, it was possible to \nsee that the KrF excimer laser-induced patterned nylon 6,6 samples did not give rise to an enhanced \nosteoblast cell response when compared to the as-received sample (AR). Having said that, the KrF \nexcimer laser-induced patterned nylon 6,6 samples did not hinder cell response either and as such can \nbe seen to give an equivalent response to that seen with the as-received sample. In fact, the only \ndifference which could be ascertained between the as-received sample and the KrF excimer laser-\ninduced patterned samples was that of the cell morphology which can be attributed to surface \nparameter variations on account of the laser-material interaction. \n \n \n \n4.4.2 \u2013 KrF Excimer Laser Whole Area Irradiative Processing \n \nFigure 12 shows the SEM micrographs for the KrF excimer laser whole area irradiative processed \nnylon 6,6 samples following four days incubation. As one can see the osteoblast cells were at an \nadvanced stage of cell growth following 4 days of incubation. Furthermore, it can be seen that the \nmorphologies appear to have varied somewhat. Sample EWA100 (see Figure 12(a)) gave rise to a \nmore clumped like whereas the other samples (see Figure 12(b) to Figure 12(f)) gave rise to a more \nradial cell morphology. This further suggests that the variation in surface properties as a result of the \nlaser treatment had a significant impact upon cell signalling and can be seen as an attractive means for \npotential use within regenerative medicine.  \n \nFigure 10 shows that the cell cover density for all of the KrF excimer laser whole area irradiative \nprocessed samples tended towards 100% after 4 days of incubation. However, it can be said that the \nlowest cell cover density was determined for sample EWA250_1000 which had a cell cover density of \naround 83%. This is significant as it suggests that a considerably more hydrophilic surface such as \nsample EWA250_1000 gave rise to a less enhanced osteoblast cell response as discussed in Section \n4.3.2. \n \nTo further confirm the effects of the KrF excimer laser whole area irradiative processing on the \nosteoblast cell response after four days a cell count was undertaken. Figure 11 shows that most of the \nKrF excimer laser whole area irradiative processed samples gave rise to a larger cell count of around \n47,000 cells\/ml when compared to the as-received sample (AR) which had a cell count of just less \nthan 40,000 cells\/ml. By comparing the KrF excimer laser whole area irradiative processed samples \nalone it was found that upon an increasing fluence and incident pulse numbers, the cell count reduced \nconsiderably to the point where sample EWA250_500 and sample EWA250_1000 had a cell count \naround 33,000 cells\/ml which was less than that of the as-received sample (AR). This can allow one to \nsee that these samples hindered the osteoblast cell response in comparison to the as-received sample \n(AR).  \n \n4.4.3 \u2013 Wettability Characteristics and Surface Parameters \n \nFigure 11 shows that for the KrF excimer laser-induced patterned samples there did not appear to be \nany correlative relationship between the cell count and \u03b8. This can be further accounted for by the \ntransition in wetting regime which is likely to have had effect on the osteoblast cell response. On the \ncontrary, it can be seen from Figure 11 that the KrF excimer laser whole area irradiative processed \nsamples could to some extent have had a correlation between the cell count and \u03b8. Since, the cell \ncount appears to have reduced on account of a drop in \u03b8.  \n It can also be seen from Figure 11 that there did not appear to be any correlation between \u03b3P and the \ncell count for the KrF excimer laser-induced patterned nylon 6,6 samples. In general, for the KrF \nexcimer laser whole area irradiative processed samples Figure 11 shows that there could have been a \nslight correlative trend in that the cell count reduced on account of an increase in \u03b3P. In addition to \nthis, the data presented in Figure 11 to some extent shows an inverse relationship between \u03b8 and \u03b3P \nand as such supports the relationship between \u03b8 and \u03b3P identified in Section 4.2.  \n \nFigure 11 allows one to see that upon a significant reduction in \u03b3T for the KrF excimer laser-induced \npatterned samples the cell count increased slightly by up to 5,000 cells\/ml compared to the as-\nreceived sample (AR). Similarly, for the KrF excimer laser whole area irradiative processed samples \nit was found that the cell count decreased dramatically on account of an increase in \u03b3T. Furthermore, \nfrom Figure 11 one can see that for all of the KrF excimer laser processed nylon 6,6 samples the cell \ncount had a strong correlation with surface oxygen content in that an increase in surface oxygen \ncontent brought about a reduction in the cell count, coinciding with what has been observed \npreviously in Section 4.3.3. However, as stated in Section 4.3.3 this does not necessarily mean that an \nincrease in the surface oxygen content hinders cell response but could be used as an indirect indicator \nof how a KrF excimer laser processed nylon 6,6 will perform when in contact with osteoblast cells.  \n \nSimilar to the observations following 24 hrs incubation, there were no observations as to any \ncorrelation between the surface roughness parameters Ra and Sa and the osteoblast cell response. This \nindicates that the surface roughness following laser surface treatment was not a dominating parameter \ngoverning the biomimetic nature of the laser surface modified nylon 6,6. In Section 4.3.3 it was seen \nthat there could potentially be an operating threshold window for \u03b8, \u03b3P and \u03b3T in order for KrF excimer \nlaser processed nylon 6,6 to give an enhanced osteoblast cell response. However, after 4 days \nincubation these trends have not been identified and suggest that the two different KrF excimer laser \nprocessing techniques do not correlate to the same trend when accounting for the osteoblast cell \nresponse. Having said that, it may be the case that the surface parameters and wettability \ncharacteristics played a more significant role in the preliminary stages of cell growth, explaining the \nreduction in correlative trends observed after four days of incubation. Even so, trends to some extent \nhave been observed for the laser whole area irradiative processed samples over both the 24 hrs and \n4 day incubation period. As a result of this, one can say that the laser whole area irradiative \nprocessing technique holds more promise in the prediction of cell response and has more potential for \nuse within regenerative medicine. \n \n \n \n5.0 \u2013 Conclusions \n \nIt has been further demonstrated that UV lasers offer an efficient and convenient means of surface \nmodifying materials. It has been shown that a KrF excimer laser can be used for two different types of \nlaser surface treatment: surface patterning and whole area irradiative processing. These different types \nof KrF excimer laser surface treatment have been seen to give rise to different topographies and \nwettability modifications on the nylon 6,6 samples. For the laser-induced patterned samples \u03b8 was \nfound to have increased by up to 24\u00b0 when compared to the as-received sample even though Ra and \nSa had increased; whereas the KrF excimer laser whole area processed samples gave \u03b8 to either be \nequivalent to the as-received sample or have a \u03b8 less by up to 20\u00b0. The increase in \u03b8 for the KrF \nexcimer laser-induced patterned samples can be explained by the likely presence of a mixed-state \nwetting regime. Having said that, even though a change in wetting regime is likely it has still been \nobserved that \u03b3P and \u03b3T still play a big role in the wettability of nylon 6,6 such that \u03b8 was a decreasing \nfunction of \u03b3P and \u03b3T.  \n \nThe KrF excimer laser surface treatment employed throughout this study had a significant impact on \ncell response in terms of cell differentiation, cell cover density and cell count. After 24 hrs incubation \nit was seen that the osteoblast cells had begun to adhere and proliferate across the surface of each of \nthe nylon 6,6 samples with the majority of laser-modified samples giving rise to larger cover \ndensities. Leading on, following 4 days of incubation it was found that all samples had given rise to \nan advanced stage of cell growth giving cell cover densities of around 100%. However, it was seen \nthat the cell count had increased for most of the laser processed samples indicating a more bioactive \nsurface. \n \nThose samples irradiated with low incident fluences and pulse numbers gave rise to the largest \nenhancements in bioactivity. However, on account of the erratic results obtained for the laser-induced \npatterned samples due to the likely influence from the mixed-state wetting regime, less correlative \ntrends between the different parameters were identified. This allows one to see that the laser whole \narea irradiative processing technique is a more attractive method for modulating and predicting \nosteoblast cell response. Overall, it has been determined that the laser-induced modifications have \ngiven rise to modulated osteoblast cell response in terms of cell proliferation and differentiation. \nTherefore, on account of the differing surface parameters giving rise to the modulation of cell \nresponses one can deduce that laser surface treatment holds a large potential to be widely employed \nwithin regenerative medicine. \n \n \n \n6.0 \u2013 Acknowledgements \n \nThe authors would like to thank their collaborators: Directed Light Inc., East Midlands NHS \nInnovation Hub, Nobel Biocare and Photomachining Inc. for all of their much appreciated support. \nThe authors would also like to thank Chemical Engineering, Loughborough University for use of \ntheir biological laboratory.
