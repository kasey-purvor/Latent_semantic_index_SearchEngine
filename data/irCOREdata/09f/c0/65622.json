Rilke, Letters to a Young Poet, Aug. 12th, 1904).\nThis paper explores the hypothesis of a literary and cultural criticism\nopen to the deconstructive force of the environmental crisis. It also\nseeks to deploy it on a short story by the contemporary London writer\nWill Self, \u2018Waiting\u2019 (1991),1 which is in part on the issue of traffic\ncongestion.\n\u2018We live in the age of unintended consequences\u20192\nOne of the most significant features of the early twentieth-first century\nhas been a growing awareness of a deep and systematic injustice in the\nworkings of contemporary government, political thinking, and many\nmodes of thought and analysis in the universities and daily life. The\ninjustice is incalculable in its extent, possibly catastrophic, but also so\nforeign to currently dominant modes of thought and practice as to seem\nbizarre or even nonsensical when first described. This injustice is the\nlack of political representation of future generations.3\nThe context here, of course, is that terrifying yet now routine litany\nof unfolding and predicted environmental disasters, already so numbly\nfamiliar that details can be consigned to an endnote.4 At no time before\nhas the future condition of the physical world been so assiduously\nstudied and mapped out, to the point, ironically, of neutralising the\nhorror of the probable scenarios. Yet the unborn remain unrepresented\nin governments that enact laws and pursue policies already well\nunderstood as very likely drastically to degrade or even ruin their lives,\nor effectively to deny life in the first place. According to current theories\nof deliberative democracy,\ncollectively binding decisions can only be regarded\nas just or ethically justifiable if they result from a\n46 Oxford Literary Review\nprocess of thorough and reasoned deliberation where all\naffected parties or their representatives have had the\nopportunity to participate . . . From this standpoint, the\npresent organisation of political and legal institutions in\nconstitutional democracies is problematic or unjust.5\nBut how could they be there? The unborn person has a peculiar\nhovering status, between being an evident non-issue \u2013 someone who\ndoes not exist can obviously have no rights \u2013 and being the latest and\nstrangest form of the victim, being utterly without power.\nThe unborn have become a strange figure of protest, one stifled\ndaily by measures that sustain economic, political and social systems\nthat have long been demonstrated as their probable ruin. These\nspectral multitudes of human and innumerable non-human creatures\nsilently undermine the legitimacy of the governments of the present,\nincluding most of their rhetoric of \u2018sustainability.\u2019 Confronting this,\nKristian Ekeli proposes that measures representing the claims of future\ngenerations be incorporated into the constitutional bases of states.\nThus in many cases \u2018courts should have the competence to appoint\nguardians for future people, and these guardians should be empowered\nto initiate legal proceedings on behalf of posterity on the basis of\nthe [proposed] posterity provision [in national constitutions].\u20196 Alan\nCarter, however, argues that the injustice to future generations is now\nso serious and the environmentally destructive syndromes of world\npolitics and economics so deeply entrenched that civil disobedience\nis a duty: \u2018the environmental crises are so pressing that we do not have\ntime to wait.\u20197\nThe environmental crisis is inherently deconstructive, viciously so,\nof current modes of thought in politics, economics and cultural\nand literary theory. At the same time, the lack of engagement\nwith environmentalism in deconstructive thinking seems increasingly\ndamaging. If, in Simon Critchley\u2019s words, \u2018Deconstruction is the\npractice of reading as the discomfort of a heritage,\u20198 endlessly asking\nagain who or what we are through new readings of that heritage,\nthen one cannot evade the kinds of future calculable from out of that\nheritage. These projected futures are not incalculable or unknown: they\nare thus, already, a peculiar part of the heritage. Here, to talk with\nJacques Derrida of a responsible interpretation or politics as one that\nTimothy Clark 47\nsays \u2018come\u2019 to some unanticipatable future \u2018event\u2019 may seem a little\nportentous and not obviously relevant.9\nDerrida\u2019s Specters of Marx is nevertheless unusual in offering a\nconcept of justice in intergenerational terms. Political identities and\ncontroversies are no longer seen as a matter of struggles between given\nidentities each defined by their social position or group membership.\nThey are rather to be understood in relation to the always debateable\nnature of that inheritance in which they find themselves and the\nquestion of modes of responsibility to variously envisaged futures.10\nAt the same time, environmental issues also effect a drastic shift in\nthe distinction between the political and non-political in ways that\nseem alien even to Derrida\u2019s criticisms of the liberal rights-based\njustice tradition. Ulrich Beck takes up the sheer tragic-comic oddness of\nthe metamorphosis undergone by the political in a crowded but finite\nworld dominated by means of production that demand continuous\neconomic expansion:\nClass conflicts or revolutions change power relations and\nexchange elites, but they hold fast to the goals of techno-\neconomic progress and clash over mutually recognized\ncivil rights. The double face of \u2018self-annihilating progress,\u2019\nhowever, produces conflicts that cast doubt on the social\nbasis of rationality \u2013 science, law, democracy. In that way,\nsociety is placed under permanent pressure to negotiate\nfoundations without a foundation. It experiences an\ninstitutional destabilization, in which all decisions \u2013 from\nlocal government policy on speed limits and \u2018parking lots\u2019\nto the manufacturing details of industrial goods to the\nfundamental issues of energy supply, law, and technological\ndevelopment \u2013 can suddenly be sucked into fundamental\npolitical conflicts.11\nBill McKibben captured something of the Alice-in-the-Looking-\nGlass quality of environmental issues when he took up the threat of\nCFC gases to the ozone layer and wrote of the nation consigning\nitself to oblivion through the use of underarm deodorants.12 Many\nenvironmental issues seem like this, bizarrely linking the intensifying\ndevastation of the world with such things as a person\u2019s day to day\n48 Oxford Literary Review\ndriving, shopping or eating habits. \u2018Ecological damage by rich nations,\u2019\nwe read, \u2018is costing poor nations more than their combined foreign\ndebt.\u201913 This crisis rarely involves those tense or inventive inter-\ncultural encounters that invite the insights or virtuosity of postcolonial\ncritics, with their accounts of hybridity, \u2018subversion of dominant\nrepresentations,\u2019 and so on. It is more to do with things like cheap\nfurniture or the contents of a supermarket salad. It may seem like global\ncatastrophe as scripted by Monty Python.\nThe End of Externality.\nTo search for general principles of some mode of reading that could\nsituate texts or events in relation to the issue of injustice to the unborn\nis to find little to go on. An exception is the work of David Wood,\na still rare voice calling for deconstructive thinking to engage with\nenvironmentalism. Wood writes of one facet of current globalisation\nas the loss of externality. By this he means:\nNow there is no outside, no space for expansion, no more\nterra nullius, no Lebensraun, no slack, no \u2018out\u2019 or \u2018away\u2019\nas when we throw something \u2018out\u2019 or \u2018away\u2019. . . . . Yet so\nmuch of our making sense, let alone the intelligibility of\nour actions, still rests on being able to export, exclude,\nexternalise what we do not want to consider. When that\nexternality is no longer available, we are in trouble.14\nSeveral such externalities have been the sea, the atmosphere, people\noutside the \u2018developed countries\u2019 and, above all, the future. The end of\n\u2018externality\u2019 means that the consequences of human action do not go\naway any more. They build up with destructive effects in the air and\nin the street. \u2018[T]he refusal to consider such consequences makes sense\nwhen the future is elsewhere, a world away. But in a finite world, many\nmore futures will catch up with us, and the luxury of kicking the ball\ninto the long grass is no longer available.\u201915 The primary human reality\nis becoming more and more a realm of inherited and accumulating\naccidents, after-effects and long term repercussions. To live in a space\nin which illusions of externality have dissolved is to see the slow erosion\nof the distinction between the distant waste dump and the housing\nestate, between the air and a sewer, between the open road and a car\nTimothy Clark 49\npark, and between the self-satisfied affluence of a London suburb and\na drowning village in Bangladesh. Is it any coincidence that the society\nin which the destructive syndrome of wealth and waste production has\nbeen at its most self-righteously intense, the United States, is also one\nwhose cultural self-image was formed against the space of the frontier\nas a seemingly unlimited externality? Internalised, such \u2018externality\u2019\nalso gives space or impetus to certain temporary freedoms, the cult of\nindividual opportunity, mobility and \u2018self-creation,\u2019 yet the \u2018ideological\npromotion of the individual consumer may have as its unintended\nconsequence the destruction of the world.\u201916\nWood\u2019s formula, \u2018end of externality,\u2019 is primarily an empirical and\nhistorical point \u2013 that inherited modes of thought and practice in the\nWest have been dominated by presuppositions that the natural world\nwas an endless resource, that the cost of, say, iron ore or water was\nsolely the human labour involved in its extraction but that nature itself\ncame \u2018free.\u201917 At the same time, the issue is also those primarily Western\nstructures of thinking whose seeming coherence is a function of the way\nthey deploy categories of internal and external. As well as dominant\nsystems of market economics unable even to register environmental\ndestruction as a cost, this might include a certain dogmatic \u2018objectivism\u2019\nin the culture of experimental science and technology since Francis\nBacon, an objectivism that has emerged as insufficiently objective in its\nfalse belief \u2018that one could act upon the world without oneself being\nacted upon.\u201918 Here, the environmental crisis asserts itself as an effective\ndeconstruction of such modes of thinking, their internal collapse under\nthe weight of their own logic. What Derrida once called \u2018Western\nmetaphysics\u2019 is now also a dust cloud of eroded top-soil, a dying forest\nand what may now be the largest man-made feature detectable from\nspace, the vast floating island of plastic debris that spans a large part of\nthe Pacific ocean.19\nEcological thinking strives to understand how waste dumped into\nthe sea or the atmosphere does not conveniently disappear but sets\noff an unpredictable sequence of consequences. An analogous kind of\nthinking in cultural politics and criticism more broadly would need\nto incorporate a futural dimension as a space of both responsibility\nand contestation. For instance, work in environmental ethics has\nunderlined the alarming clash between the assumptions of mainstream\nliberalism and the demands of environmental \u2013 i.e. long term \u2013 issues.\n50 Oxford Literary Review\nWilson Carey McWilliams\u2019s study, The Idea of Fraternity in America\nalready argued in 1973 that the central plank of liberal thought is\ninherently destructive of the natural world.20 Its foundational assump-\ntion is that that a human being is essentially a private, atomistic\nand apolitical individual striving to maximise personal wealth and\nadvantage. Politics is held to arise because the relative scarcity of\nnatural resources compels such individuals to form compacts of\nmutual recognition and respect, rights, in order not to come into\nconflict. In other words, a liberal political tradition, looking back to\nThomas Hobbes and John Locke in the 17th Century, sees politics as\nessentially a compact between individuals for the better mastery\nof \u2018nature\u2019 (which may also include, in the past, other human\nbeings). Michael Zimmerman is especially severe on the provenance\nof contemporary notions of right in Western notions of property,\nownership and identity that are already deeply implicated in\nenvironmental crisis. Its doctrine is\nandrocentric because its conception of persons is based\non a masculinist experience that excludes (and implicitly\nnegates) female experience; hierarchical because it gives\nprecedence to male experience, and also because it portrays\nhumans as radically more important than anything else;\ndualistic because of its distinction between human (rational,\nintrinsically valuable, rights-possessing) and non-human\n(nonrational, instrumental, lacking in rights); atomistic\nbecause it portrays humans as isolated social units; and\nabstract because conflicts about rights are settled by\nrationalistic, impersonal debates that ignore both the\nfeelings and the particular needs\/traits of the individuals\ninvolved.21\nThese simple observations may have drastic implications. The need to\nfind effective notions of value outside the individualistic liberal rights\ntradition (to affirm, say, the intrinsic value of a creature or place)\nalso puts one at odds with the intellectual and legal bases of the US\nand other modern nation states. As Catherine L. Albanese writes: \u2018the\nchecks and balances of [the American] constitutional system [are], for\nTimothy Clark 51\nliberals, part of a competitive process conceived as the best means to\nsubdue nature while yet controlling human combat.\u201922 Is it then any\nwonder that environmentalist politics so often finds itself pushed from\na reformist agenda towards a more revolutionary and anarchist one?\nTo foreground the question of justice to the unborn also disrupts\nsome of the current norms of literary and cultural criticism. Much\nmodern literary criticism is itself determined by the predominantly\nliberal progressive tradition. Work in the humanities often concerns\nitself with questions of justice and social exclusion for which notions\nof rights and infringed right are a crucial assumption. Even in work\nwhere the foreground arguments are more sophisticated, the rhetoric\nof liberalism often predominates (\u2018free ourselves from x,\u2019 \u2018hemmed\nin by y\u2019, \u2018imprisoned by z,\u2019 \u2018resists its marginalization,\u2019 \u2018strives for\nautonomy\u2019 etc). Yet, if, as Andrew Vincent concludes: \u2018it is the very\nvalues and practices of liberalism which now constitute the supreme\nenvironmental danger,\u201923 then the liberal norm itself, with its associated\nlure of unsustainable affluence, needs to become the issue. The case\nneeds to answered that the liberal property and rights-holding subject\ncan no longer function as a justifiable norm because its condition was\nan era of colonial expansion and invention that seemed to provide a\nboundless externality \u2013 a condition summed up by Tom Stoppard\u2019s\nsatirical motto in Jumpers (1972), \u2018No problem is insoluble given\na big enough plastic bag.\u201924 A modern Walt Whitman celebrating\nsymbolic rebirth as a poet on the edge of the great ocean, as in \u2018Out of\nthe Cradle Endlessly Rocking,\u2019 would now be tripping over piles of\nplastic detritus.25 Equivalent to the debris would the acerbic taste\nof critical readings of his \u2018Song of Myself \u2019 that measured its American\nideology of unlimited personal development and opportunity against\nsome of its destructive consequences.26 The Dickens who wrote David\nCopperfield would not now find it so easy to shift its variously deserving\nbut anomalous characters, such as the \u2018fallen\u2019 Emily or the feckless\nMr Micawber, to a conveniently appropriated colony called \u2018Australia\u2019\nwhere they could suddenly flourish while the book rounds itself off\nwith the achieved image of Copperfield as a model of bourgeois success.\nEnvironmental criticism must be awkwardly circumspect of readings\nwhose implicit or explicit principle is essentially that the status of\nthe individualistic rights-and-property bearing subject should simply\nbecome available to all. For instance, Jackie Stacey gives an account\n52 Oxford Literary Review\nof how identification with images of female Hollywood stars offered\nwomen in 1950s Britain a mode of resistance to oppressive gender\nroles but does not trace how the understandable attraction of images of\n\u2018autonomy,\u2019 \u2018individuality\u2019 and \u2019independence\u2019 also feed into a liberal\nagenda that must finally complicate them as norms.27\nContemporary work on kinds of contestation for cultural power\nand recognition is too often, as Wendy Brown argues, \u2018tethered to a\nformulation of justice that reinscribes a bourgeois (masculinist) ideal\nas its measure.\u201928 Worse, it reinforces the liberal norm by its way of\nprotestation of exclusion from it. One of the failings of recent criticism\non environmental justice is that it still sometimes turns on the issues of\ninclusion\/exclusion in relation to this norm, instead of engaging with\n\u2018post-materialist\u2019 values, the defence of alternative modes of life.29 Yet\nthere have been no convincing rebuttals of E.OWilson\u2019s argument that\nfor everyone to have the material \u2018standard of living\u2019 of the average\nAmerican would require the additional resources of three more planets\nthe size of the earth.30 Does this not also mean that readings of modern\nliterature and social exclusion that endorse a just world as one in which\neveryone could, for example, own a car are not cogent, for such a world\nwould have already consumed its own future?\nThe addition of a futural perspective breaks down received\ndistinctions of the political and non-political in ways that currently\nfind no outlet in the categories of given cultural or literary criticism.\nThe fact that a critic\u2019s being a motorist, flying to conferences, eating\nbeefsteak or even buying a particular kind of banana may ultimately\nbe of more real significance than his or her professed political stance\nmust destabilise modern criticism in bizarre and uncomfortable ways.\nIts often vociferous liberalism may come to look like an evasion of\nthat other imponderable \u2018politics\u2019 inherent in undiscussed assumptions\nabout personal affluence and lifestyle, conceptions of professional\nsuccess and mobility and distinctions between the public and the\nprivate. At present, however, there seem few ways of conceptualising\nissues such as excessive material affluence that do not slide towards\nbeing an off-putting kind of green moralism.\n\u2018Waiting\u2019\nSome of these issues play themselves out in suggestive ways in Will\nSelf \u2019s short story of 1991, \u2018Waiting.\u2019 Summarily speaking, the text\nTimothy Clark 53\nis a case study of the breakdown of received categories of sense and\ncoherence brought about by the psychic stress of traffic congestion.\nThis text invites a kind of environmental criticism that does not rest\non an anachronistic appeal to some supposedly lost relation to \u2018nature\u2019\nbut which traces the structures of the auto-interruption, auto-paralysis\nor auto-immunity of the heritage of consumerist liberalism.\nAn initial reading of \u2018Waiting\u2019 might see it as a study of individual\nand environment. Jim Stonehouse, a copy-editor, is a sort of amateur\ncultural critic fond of making slick observations on modern society.\nThe narrative opens with a car scene on an approach road to London,\nlate on a Sunday evening. Despite the time, the traffic builds up, and\neventually almost stops. The frustration of being stalled in endless\nugly lines of cars finally leads Jim to run off into the night shouting\n\u2018 \u201cI can\u2019t stand this any more, I\u2019m getting out of here\u201d \u2019 (p. 173),\nabandoning both his car and its passenger (the narrator). His deepening\nobsession with congestion in London leads to a peculiar personal\nreligion in which \u2018waiting\u2019 becomes the hidden key to everything:\ntraffic wardens are \u2018 \u201cthe Secret Police of Waiting\u201d \u2019 (p. 197); the\nlong lunch queues and crowded pavements of central London enact\na universal condition of \u2018waiting\u2019 and Jim even tends to speak in\nrhetorical questions, that is, questions that need not wait for an answer.\nThis all culminates in his interest in the impending millennium:\n\u2018 \u201cEveryone is convinced that something is going to happen, but they\ndon\u2019t know what it is\u201d \u2019. Jim takes the narrator to hear a lecture\nby one Professor Stein on how the forthcoming millennium will\ncompare with the religious fanaticism and terror ascribed to people in\nthe year one thousand. Stein\u2019s conclusion \u2013 subsequently borne out\nby events \u2013 is pastiche J.G. Ballard: \u2018 \u201cThe end of this current era\nwill be met with at worst indifference and at best with some quite\ngood television retrospectives\u201d \u2019 (\u2018Waiting,\u2019 p. 186). Jim, of course\nvehemently disagrees and denounces Stein: \u2018 \u201c . . . people are desperately\nwaiting for something \u2013 anything to happen\u201d \u2019 (p. 187).\nThe story of Jim\u2019s seeming breakdown through an obsession with\ntraffic congestion correlates well with humanist attacks on the psychic\nand social effects of an environment dominated by the private\ncar. \u2018Waiting\u2019 compares closely, for instance, with the discourse of\nthe \u2018Campaign for Better Transport\u2019 (formerly \u2018Transport 2000\u2019)\nor with Lynn Sloman\u2019s Car Sick (2006) a book whose provenance\n54 Oxford Literary Review\nlies in continuing British campaigns against road building and the\ndomination of civic space by private vehicles. Sloman writes:\nOur car-oriented culture makes individuals feel that they\nhave a right to enjoy the immediately obvious benefits\nof car use, while ignoring or denying the longer-term\ndisadvantages to themselves and other people. We are\noffered instant satisfaction, and we feel we are entitled to\ngrab it.31\nThe car intensifies a psychology of enclosed individualism but then\nenacts the familiar paradox of technology taking over its supposed\nusers. \u2018Cars have come to control us, rather than the other way\naround\u2019 (Sloman),32 or, as Self writes in a later context, cars \u2018con their\nautopilots with the illusion of freedom.\u201933 Sloman, like other transport\ncampaigners, uses images of addiction to depict \u2018car dependency\u2019 as a\nmildly pathological condition. Her book\u2019s subtitle is Solutions for our\nCar-addicted Culture.\n\u2018Waiting\u2019 reads as a study of such addiction, its consumerist logic\nof dependency and vehement demand. Ultimately, the general malaise\nof waiting is not even for anything specific: it is intransitive, an\nintensification of itself, like traffic that gets slower and slower the more\npeople use cars to move faster and faster. Self \u2019s apocalypse of non-\napocalypse is a collapse into each other of imminence and immanence,\na kind of universal psychic and social \u2018congestion\u2019 in which the only end\nor content of waiting is more stressful waiting. Ulrich Beck observes\nhow world reality is set increasingly to becomes a gigantic artificial and\naccidental side effect, one evolving according to its own peculiar and\nunwelcome laws and bearing human motives, desires and aggression\nwith it:\ncongestion has become a metaphor for the involuntary\npoliticization of modernity. It symbolizes the forced utopia\nof self-limitation. Congestion means the involuntary sit-\ndown strike of everyone against everyone else, technically\nimposed mass Buddhism, an egalitarian forced meditation\nfor drivers of all classes of cars. \u2018You\u2019re not caught in\nthe congestion, you are the congestion\u2019 is written in large\nTimothy Clark 55\nletters in a tunnel. Thus congestion becomes the quality\nof an entire culture . . . the implacable \u2018more\u2019 and \u2018faster\u2019\nof . . . modernity collides everywhere with the problems,\nerosion and obstructions it generates.34\n\u2018Waiting\u2019 seems a study of someone pathologised by traffic conditions\nto the point of breakdown, with Jim eventually joining the bizarre\npseudo-messianic cult of a despatch rider called Carlos who has a\nunique gift for getting across the congested city. Despatch riders, Jim\nclaims:\n\u2018are the real waiters. Waiting is ground into them. Every\nmoment could be an arrival, at a pick-up or drop-off,\nor the ultimate drop-off, death itself ! No wonder they\nunderstand what is happening. They exist at the precise\njuncture between the imminent and the immanent! Carlos\nhas seen their potential. He is a man of extraordinary\npowers, he understands that the future will belong to those\nwho clearly articulate the Great Wait!\u2019 (p. 190)\nJim is finally taken to court after being prosecuted for assault on\nanother motorist, an incident of what would now be called \u2018road rage.\u2019\nThe court refers him for further psychiatric assessment, but only, it\nemerges, because there would be a wait for any prison space.\nAs if she were offering a reading of \u2018Waiting,\u2019 Sloman observes\nhow mass car use helps destroy a sense of cultural cohesiveness and\nshared responsibility. She cites a US study which \u2018 \u201csuggests that each\nadditional ten minutes in daily commuting time cuts involvement in\ncommunity affairs by 10 per cent.\u201d \u201935\n\u2018Waiting\u2019 thus reads as a kind of green protest story. Car ownership\nis part of the ideology of the neo-liberal subject \u2013 go where you want\nwhen you want, all in your cosy private space. It is the icon and\nenactment of a narrow notion of individual freedom, with new models\nadvertised yearly in dishonest images of unimpeded speed through\nvast frontier spaces. The automobile is \u2018an ideology on four wheels.\u201936\nCongestion by the private car highlights how a narrow liberal idea of\n\u2018freedom\u2019 imprisons itself by its own incoherence as a unlimited ideal\nwithin a finite world. Jim\u2019s story is that of the fabricated rebellion of a\n56 Oxford Literary Review\nmotorist who aims to \u2018beat the system.\u2019 Congestion, with all it stands\nfor, becomes an effective deconstruction of the notion of the liberal\nindividual subjectivity that it enacts. Jim\u2019s obsessive pursuit of free road\nspace and his denigration of anyone in the way as a mere \u2018waiter\u2019 asserts\na psyche totally structured in desire by the very system it claims to defy\nand overcome.\nDelayed Action\nSelf \u2019s novel of 2006, The Book of Dave,37 projects the London of a few\ncenturies\u2019 time as a space in which a few islands like Hampstead Heath\n(\u2018Ham\u2019) rise above a warm lagoon. England has become an archipelago,\nless a fantastic fiction than an all too plausible scenario. This posits\nanother context for reading \u2018Waiting.\u2019 The banal egalitarian apocalypse\nof climate change brings an ironic close to the syndromes of intensified\nwaiting, the queues of traffic and the collapse of the distinction between\nimminence and immanence. Additionally, the destruction of most of\nthe country suggests, to say the least, a retrospective delegitimation\nof the assumptions, values and modes of governance dominant in the\nLondon of 1991.\nDerrida wrote of a destabilising of inherited concepts of sovereignty\nacross the world: distinctions between the foreign and domestic,\ninternal and external, become less and less certain. The likelihood\nof environmental catastrophe, an issue on which Derrida was\nuncharacteristically obtuse, adds new weight to this observation. David\nWood writes of the explicit quest of certain governing forces in the US\nfor global domination as\na genuinely impossible goal that can be expected to provoke\nseismic instabilities down the road. This is true politically,\nbut it is just as obviously so environmentally. Even if one\nstate could successfully impose its will on all other states on\nthe planet, nature is not so forgiving. And all the forecasts\nsuggest that as an energy-consumption form of life, the\nAmerican way of life [or, for that matter, the British] \u2018has\nno future.\u201938\nThe two Will Self texts of 1991 and 2006 exemplify a more\ndifficult general challenge: this is to reread the texts and cultures of\nTimothy Clark 57\nmodernity as a heritage which includes a rationally predictable but\noften extremely alarming future. In practice such work must be both\nextremely cautious, so as not to lapse into a kind of self-defeating\napocalyptic rhetoric, and also be often imponderable. It may require\nthe cultivation of an ecological and scientific literacy as well as a\nhistorical and literary one, and would sometimes mean something as\nnear to impossible as anticipating the hindsight of the future, living\nconsciously in that usually oblivious between-space inherent to what\nFreud called the nachtr\u00e4glich,39 i.e. anticipating now that \u2018delayed\naction\u2019 whereby something unnoticed or ordinary at one time may later\nemerge, in retrospect, even after one\u2019s death, as traumatic \u2013 or as \u2018having\nbeen \u201ctraumatic\u201d,\u2019 for the time of the traumatic event is not locatable\non any linear series. Such is already the uncertain space and affliction of\nenvironmental awareness. Viewed in terms of the deceptive rationality\nand scale of day to day life, environmental activists remain condemned\n\u2018to get everything out of perspective,\u2019 seeming to veer between a general\npriggishness about trivialities and an empty apocalypticism.\nThe end of externality enacts a profound crisis of thought and\npolitics, as well as an economic, social and psychological one. Bob\nPepperman Taylor writes, \u2018the ecological facts of life threaten to\nchallenge our most dearly held political values: justice, freedom, and\ndemocracy,\u201940 a view that might be reformulated less drastically as the\nneed to revise those very notions of \u2018justice, freedom, and democracy\u2019 to\nembrace the unborn, and even the non human. Drawing on the work\nof Beck, Wood, Derrida and others perhaps the following summary\nchallenges emerge.\n\u2022 The realisation that conceptions and practices at the basis of Western\nthought and commonsense are deeply implicated in the global\nenvironmental crisis and that this requires a drastic shift in basic\nassumptions and in the minutiae of language, thought and criticism.\n\u2022 The continuing need to extend concepts of politics beyond the\nborders of the nation state.\n\u2022 To address the emerging breakdown in the given modes of\naccountability, responsibility and litigation (\u2018to put it by reference\nto a single example: the injured of Chernobyl are today, years after\nthe catastrophe, not even all born yet\u2019 (Beck)).41\n58 Oxford Literary Review\n\u2022 To review the prevailing notions, principles and institutions of\n\u2018rationality\u2019 and psychic health.\n\u2022 To work through modes of thought adequate to the current crisis\nin the sense of scale, e.g. the gap between the huge collective\nconsequences of individual actions and the triviality of each action\nin itself. How do congestion and over-population in themselves\ntransform the very nature of the political?42\n\u2022 To help find ways of addressing the issue of excessive material\naffluence, without moralism and wary of the looming threat of\neco-fascism.\n\u2018London is not in England but England in London.\u2019\nSome of these issues are pertinent to a second look at \u2018Waiting.\u2019 So far,\nthis text has been described as a kind of green protest story. It seems to\npursue the logic of traffic congestion, of the private car as the symptom\nof liberal individualism, to a point of self-paralysis. Implicitly, then,\n\u2018Waiting\u2019 would seem to call for the tempering of consumerist attitudes\nby a greater sense of communal responsibility, as in the humanist\ndiscourse of transport campaign groups.\nElements of Self \u2019s text, however, destabilise all this. To read\n\u2018Waiting\u2019 as a straightforwardly realist text, a study of breakdown under\nenvironmental stress, blocks off what actually happens in the scene\nwith Carlos, the cult despatch rider blessed with seemingly miraculous\ndriving skills. To demonstrate his gifts to the narrator he claims he can\nmake in just forty-five minutes a journey across London that would\nnormally take twice that time (specifically, to drive from Soho Square\nto the Horniman Museum via Shootup Hill). Carlos enters a kind of\ntrance, then drives off, with the narrator and Jim following behind\nby car.\nI registered all these junctures, but only vaguely. There was\nan unreal, static sensation to the journey. The long London\nroads were panoramic scenery that wound back behind us to\nprovide the illusion of movement. The MZ and the Sierra\nstood still, occupying a different zone.\nWe reached Shootup Hill in about seventeen minutes.\nThe facility with which Carlos had led us was unnatural.\nAt every juncture where there was an opportunity for a\nTimothy Clark 59\nchoice, he took the right one . . . Carlos had not only\napprehended every road, he had anticipated every alleyway,\nevery mews, every garage forecourt and the position and\nsynchronisation of every traffic light. (pp. 197\u20138)\nWhat wins out in this disruptive sub-text is that primal fantasy of\nmotoring that seduces Jim and so many others in the first place.\nIt is the fantasy fed by innumerable car chases on film or television\nwhere the audience is invited to identify with an exciting, invulnerable\ndash through the most improbable kind of obstacle course. In such\nscenarios the body is effectively denied, absorbed into a kind of\nmentalistic floating through a set of physical objects that can never\nhurt. Self makes some related points in an interview with Ballard:\nW.S.: The interesting thing about the car is that the car\nwindscreen has been more influential in making us all\ncin\u00e9astes than film has itself. The experience of continually\ndriving around confronting a seventy-millimetre frame\nobserving the world like that. . . . The way in which we\nhave interiorised the cinematic view has something to do\nwith our dramatic rehearsal of our death, doesn\u2019t it? Having\ninternalized the cameraman\u2019s perspective, we are then free\nnotionally to annihilate figures on our screen. People of my\ngeneration are afflicted with this as if it were a virus; they\nare not aware of the extent to which their view of their\nown identity has been compromised by film and the car\nwindscreen.43\nThis episode of miraculous driving does not serve to give sense to\nthe story but to take it away, to destabilise it. Carlos is not after\nall some delusion from which Jim needs to be reclaimed to life as\na responsible citizen. The whole thing moves into a realm of the\nfantastic where talk of a character\u2019s psychic condition, his breakdown or\nresponsibility, begins to seem irrelevant. It as if the text were endorsing\nJean Baudrillard\u2019s view that we live in a world in which the \u2018will to\nspectacle and illusion\u2019 is more powerful and enduring than almost\nanything else.44\n60 Oxford Literary Review\nA similar point applies to the opening text in the same collection,\n\u2018The North London Book of the Dead.\u2019 Here the narrator describes\nthe painful scenes of his mother\u2019s death from cancer, his subsequent\ndenial, grief and a period of gradual acceptance until, one day, he\nsimply meets his mother again, walking towards him down a street in a\nvery ordinary suburb of London. What, then, is death? Death, it turns\nout, is a meaningless recycling scheme.\nI wrung it out of her eventually. It went something like\nthis: when you die you move to another part of London\nwhere you resume pretty much the same kind of life you had\nbefore you died. There are lots of dead people in London\nand quite a few dead businesses. When you\u2019ve been dead for\na few years you\u2019re encouraged to move to the provinces.45\nThis particular after-life resolves none of the big questions: it merely\ncollapses life and death upon each other as part of the same depthless\nand insignificant conveyor belt or moving walkway. Both \u2018Waiting\u2019 and\n\u2018The North London Book of the Dead\u2019 are poised provocatively and\nuncertainly between being satirical fables and self-contained fantastic\nworlds. In both cases a scenario that makes no sense asserts itself and\nwill not be rationalised away. In \u2018Waiting\u2019 the narcissistic fantasy of a\nmotoring utopia is too powerful to be fully eclipsed by a more rational\ntale of individual breakdown. In \u2018The North London Book of the\nDead\u2019 the realm of the cultural becomes all that there is or ever will be.\nDeath is no longer nature\u2019s ultimate intervention, only a turning point\nin the ceaseless proliferation of indistinguishably dead\/alive people.\nResurrection is banalised in this story as thoroughly as apocalypse is\nbanalised in \u2018Waiting.\u2019\nThese fantastic scenarios enact a dimension without externality.\nIn both texts, elements of social satire \u2013 of a London crowded with\nzombies, the self-destruction of the narrow motorist psyche \u2013 co-exist\nwith fantastic scenarios that disconnect the plot from plausible\nmaterial contexts. This gives them something of the status of verbal\ncommodities, seemingly self-contained realms operating according to\nlaws of their own, insulated from external conditions or consequences.\nThe enclosed logic of these texts enacts what Self acknowledges as his\nmore comprehensive topic, the all-appropriating power of the urban\nTimothy Clark 61\nenvironment: that \u2018the city was the main \u2013 and possibly the only \u2013\nprotagonist.\u201946 London itself often functions as the crucial agent of\nthese texts, finding form in the fantastic plot-lines that use human\ncharacters as ciphers of an impersonal and non-representational logic.\nIts space is like that of the famous map of the city\u2019s underground train\nnetwork, \u2018the tube:\u2019\nSome of us . . . live more in the diagram of the tube than\nwe do in the physical reality of London. After all, the\ntube imparts a sense of the city that is not unlike the\nchild\u2019s unmitigated vision . . . you disappear down a hole in\nthe Mile End Road and the pop out of another one in\nChalk Farm. Some people\u2019s whole lives must be like that,\nwith no coherent sense of the city\u2019s geography; they must\nfind it impossible to circumvent old lovers, evade defunct\nfriendships.47\nIn these short stories bizarre shifts of scale or in perspective deprive\nthe reader of secure modes of reference and norms of judgement,\nmaking dubious readings in terms of given notions of consistency or\n\u2018depth\u2019 of character. It is a kind of fiction in which \u2018environmental\u2019\nelements \u2013 the city\u2019s monotony and vastness, and the logic of traffic\nand its congestion \u2013 turn human characters, psychology and action into\nepiphenomenal effects. This London does not invite a Baudrillard-type\nreading celebrating it as the realm of the hyper-real. It emerges as an\nillusorily self-enclosed physical and psychic space that has blocked off\nanything external to its own functioning.48 Thus the city of the \u2018The\nNorth London Book of the Dead\u2019 generates its endlessly expanding\npopulation \u2013 and an endlessly expanding economy, for most of the\ndead seem to have jobs of some kind. Theories of the emergence of the\ncultural in the denial of mortality seem fully realised.\nLike a nascent bio-regionalist, Self recounts that eerie moment at\nwhich he realised, standing one spring day on Hill Street, Mayfair, that\nhe had \u2018never been to the mouth of the river that ran through the city\nof my birth.\u201949 He uses this to illustrate the enclosed mind-set induced\nby this urban space:\n62 Oxford Literary Review\nWhat would you think of a peasant who had farmed all his\nlife on the banks of a river if he told you he had never been\nto where that river meets the sea, some thirty miles away?\n. . . There are millions of peasants like that in London; in\nimagining themselves to be at the very navel of the world,\nLondoners have forgotten the rest of their anatomy.50\nA broader account could see the \u2018London\u2019 of these texts enacting that\nmore general and widening human environment of social, economic\nand psychic spheres that understand themselves entirely and exclusively\nas cultural entities working according to cultural laws, disregarding\nanything so entropic as the weather, animals, ill-health or even death\nexcept as inputs or outputs for their own procedures.51 Ironically,\nsuch a view would also encompass the culturalist paradigm of a\ngreat deal of modern criticism for which every thing of significance\nis striven to be understood as a \u2018construction\u2019 of some kind (as in\n\u2018Blake\u2019s construction of angels,\u2019 \u2018Dickens\u2019s construction of London,\u2019\n\u2018Dickinson\u2019s construction of the sea,\u2019 \u2018Faulkner\u2019s construction of\ndeath\u2019). It is a tellingly productionist metaphor that projects each\nhuman psyche as a miniature industrialist and, in varying degrees, a\nparallel universe in which the nature and intelligibility of any object is\nexhausted by the human cultural politics onto which it can be mapped.\nThe seemingly fantastic elements of Self \u2019s texts read then as\nmagnifications of that logic of disavowed externality that largely\ndefines the so-called \u2018developed world.\u201952 A similar enclosure underlies\ntwo other stories in The Quantity Theory of Insanity. These deploy some\nideas from the anti-psychiatry movement as satirical tropes. \u2018Ward 9,\u201953\nset in North London, is a reworking of Chekhov\u2019s \u2018Ward 6\u2019 in which\nthe inmates of a psychiatric unit are not mad but \u2018meta-mad:\u2019 that\nis, they all find themselves enacting \u2013 or being \u2018constructed\u2019 by \u2013 the\ntheories of the medical establishment; hence inmates tend to be family\nrelations of the doctors or former therapists themselves. It is a world in\nwhich the drive to conform, for existential safety, erodes the distinction\nbetween sane and insane except as mutually defining functions of\na self-perpetuating institutional machine. \u2018The Quantity Theory of\nInsanity\u201954 repeats the basic trope of a closed dimension operating\naccording to bizarre internal laws. In this case the \u2018quantity theory\u2019 of\nthe title states that in any social grouping there is only so much sanity to\nTimothy Clark 63\ngo round. This \u2018sanity quotient\u2019 will find expression in differing ratios\nof normal and deviant pathologies existing \u2013 or deliberately created \u2013 in\neach respective group. Thus: \u2018If you decrease the number of social class\n2 anorexics you necessarily increase the numbers of valium abusers in\nsocial class 4\u2019 (p. 127) or \u2018[Australians] lived in a society where constant\nrates of sanity had been achieved by the creation of a racial underclass\nwhich was killing itself with alcoholism\u2019 (p. 141).\nSelf \u2019s texts enact in heightened form modes of thinking that define\n\u2018developed\u2019 life as a realm of disavowed externality. Their characters\u2019\nidentity, desires and reasoning exist as functions of contexts that obey\nonly a fabricated, self-enclosed logic. This satirical principle could also\nbe generalised as a critical one. The only physical context or system\nthat is genuinely self-enclosed in relation to human society is the\nwhole earth itself (barring the currently implausible industrialisation\nof other bodies). Here, an uncomfortable reformulation of Self \u2019s\n\u2018sanity quotient\u2019 suggests itself, but this time as a real statement of\na nightmare difficulty through which the world must somehow pass,\neven while trying to address current massive inequalities across the\nglobe. The reformulation also describes the structural hypocrisy which\ncompromises liberal criticism: \u2018The greater the number of consumers\nwith current Western modes of affluence at time A, the greater the\nnumber of deprived and desperate people at time B.\u2019\nNotes\n1 In The Quantity Theory of Insanity (1991; London: Penguin Books, 1994),\npp. 173\u2013211.

Robert J. C.

Compare Hebert Girardet\u2019s account of\n\u2018the metabolism of cities:\u2019\nLike other organisms, cities have a definable metabolism. Themetabolism\nof most \u2018modern\u2019 cities is essentially linear, with resources flowing\nthrough the urban system without much concern about their origin and\n68 Oxford Literary Review\nabout the destination of wastes; inputs and outputs are considered as\nlargely unrelated. Raw materials are extracted, combined and processed\ninto consumer goods that end up as rubbish which can\u2019t be beneficially\nreabsorbed into living nature. Fossil fuels and extracted from rock strata,\nrefined and burned; their fumes are discharged into the atmosphere.\n(\u2018Sustainable Cities: A Contradiction in Terms?,\u2019 in The Earthscan Reader\nin Sustainable Cities, ed.

Yet\nJoanna Macy writes of the despair induced by environmental work and knowledge:\ntherapists tend to regard feelings of despair for our planet as\nmanifestations of some private neurosis.
