Introduction\nChorus waves are intense, naturally-generated electromagnetic emissions, typically oc-22\ncurring outside the plasmapause, in the magnetic local time (MLT) range \u223c 23 \u2212 15h,23\nwith frequencies of \u223c 0.1\u221210 kHz [Meredith et al., 2001; Santolik et al., 2004]. Interest in24\nchorus has recently increased due to the recognition of this wave\u2019s importance in control-25\nling radiation-belt dynamics [e.g., Horne and Thorne, 2003; Horne et al., 2005; Thorne et26\nal. 2005; Meredith et al., 2002]. Chorus can act as a mediating agent, transferring energy27\nfrom the lower energy (\u223c 10\u2212 100 keV) electrons which are predominantly precipitated,28\nto the relativistic (\u223c 1 MeV) electrons which are predominantly accelerated [e.g. Mered-29\nith et al., 2002; Horne and Thorne, 2003; Horne et al., 2005]. Since the pitch-angle and30\nenergy diffusion rates used in studying radiation-belt dynamics are critically dependent31\non the chorus wave power distribution and wave normal characteristics, accurate knowl-32\nedge of the propagation of chorus waves (power, damping, wave normal evolution, etc.)33\nis essential for an accurate evaluation.34\nIn the present paper, the effects of suprathermal electron fluxes (which lead to Landau35\ndamping) upon chorus propagation are examined using a combination of measured fluxes,36\nand ray tracing. Section 2 summarizes our methodology, and Section 3 presents the37\nresults of ray tracing, investigating the dependence of chorus propagation on the initial38\nwave normal angle. In Section 4 the ray tracing results are related to energetic electron39\nscattering, and Section 5 summarizes our findings.40\n2. Methodology\nD R A F T May 29, 2007, 3:45pm D R A F T\nX - 4 BORTNIK ET AL.: PENETRATING CHORUS\nThe methodology used to investigate the propagation characteristics and damping of41\nchorus waves has been described in detail by Bortnik et al. [2007], and consists of 3 steps:42\n1. Suprathermal electron distribution: Suprathermal electron flux observations from43\nCRRES were used to create statistical distributions as a function of L-shell (L = 1 to 7,44\nin 0.1L bins), MLT (in 1 hour bins), and AE (in 3 bins: quiet AE < 100 nT, moderate 10045\n< AE < 300 nT, and disturbed AE > 300 nT), in 4 energy channels: 0.213, 1.09, 4.25,46\nand 16.5 keV. Only flux measurements outside the plasmapause were included consistent47\nwith typical chorus wave location (see Meredith et al. [2004] for the sorting criterion).48\n2. Parameter fitting: For each L, MLT, and AE bin, the 4 flux values (i.e., the 4 energy49\nchannels above) were fitted with an assumed (isotropic) phase space density function of50\nthe form f(v) = AN\/v\nn.51\n3. Ray tracing and Landau damping: The set of functions f(v) were used to calculate52\nthe Landau damping rates [Brinca, 1972] of rays injected at the geomagnetic equator53\n[Santolik et al., 2004] from the appropriate (L, MLT) bin. The equatorial electron density54\nwas modeled with a plasmapause located at L \u223c 2.5 (reflecting disturbed conditions,55\nKpmax \u223c 6.7) after Carpenter and Anderson [1992], with off-equatorial density distributed56\naccording to the diffusive equilibrium model [Angerami and Thomas, 1964], and a dipole57\nmagnetic field. The Stanford VLF ray tracing program [Inan and Bell, 1977] was used58\nin the computation of the ray paths. Magnetic field line convergence is included by59\nmultiplying the local power density by the ratio of azimuthal arc-lengths at the ray versus60\nthe initial value, r0 cos(\u03bb0)\/r cos(\u03bb), where r and \u03bb are the radial distance and latitude of61\nthe ray and the subscript \u20180\u2019 represents initial values.62\nD R A F T May 29, 2007, 3:45pm D R A F T\nBORTNIK ET AL.: PENETRATING CHORUS X - 5\nA typical chorus ray path (see legend) is shown in Figure 1a. The fitted electron63\ndistribution f(v) (at the chosen L-MLT location) was used to calculate the path-integrated64\nLandau damping, shown together with the ray latitude as a function of group time in65\nFigure 1b. We define the ray termination point when the ray power reaches 1% of its66\ninitial value, which defines the ray lifetime (\u03c4f ), final latitude (\u03bbf ), and final distance67\n(df ). The evolution of the wave normal angle \u03c8(\u03bb) as a function of latitude is shown in68\npanel (c) indicating that even though the ray is injected with \u03c80 = 0\n\u25e6, it quickly becomes69\noblique leading to severe damping.70\nIn the following section the effect of varying \u03c80 upon \u03bbf is investigated. The angle \u03c8071\nis normalized to the Gendrin angle \u03c8G (the value of \u03c8 at which the group vector becomes72\nfield aligned, calculated using Bortnik et al. [2006a], Eq. (1)) and varied from (Earthward73\ndirected) \u22121\u03c8G to (antiEarthward directed) +1\u03c8G in steps of 0.2\u03c8G. These \u03c80 values,74\ntheir group rays, and the refractive index surface are shown in Figure 1d.75\n3. Results\nA summary of final latitude \u03bbf (MLT,L) is shown in Figure 2, parameterized by geomag-76\nnetic activity and \u03c80. Each ray is injected at \u03bb = 0\n\u25e6, f = 0.3fce. The common colorbar77\nfor \u03bbf is given at the bottom of the figure.78\nThe principal properties of the chorus distribution are:79\n\u2022 The tendency of \u03bbf to decrease with increasing L, due to the lower ratio between80\nLandau resonant suprathermal particles and cold particles (nh\/n0).81\nD R A F T May 29, 2007, 3:45pm D R A F T\nX - 6 BORTNIK ET AL.: PENETRATING CHORUS\n\u2022 The effect of geomagnetic activity upon the MLT distribution of \u03bbf . As AE increases,82\nfor a given L, \u03bbf becomes progressively more asymmetric with MLT, with maximum \u03bbf83\non the day-side, consistent with observational results.84\n\u2022 The agreement of the observed statistical distribution of chorus wave power with85\nthose rays originating at essentially field-aligned (\u03c80 = 0\n\u25e6) directions [Bortnik et al.,86\n2007].87\nFigure 2 shows that the Landau damping of chorus is strongly dependent upon \u03c80. For88\n\u03c80 \u2265 0\u25e6, the degree of Landau damping increases and \u03bbf becomes progressively smaller89\nwith increasing \u03c80. However, when \u03c80 \u2264 0\u25e6, \u03bbf increases dramatically. At \u03c80 \u223c \u22120.6\u03c8G,90\n\u03bbf (L < 6) > 60\n\u25e6 and the wave penetrates to very low altitudes (henceforth referred to91\nas \u2018penetrating chorus\u2019). As \u03c80 is decreased further, \u03bbf decreases, and at \u03c80 = \u22121\u03c8G92\nit is sensitively dependent upon f(v), becoming either very large (\u03bbf > 60\n\u25e6) at low L93\nand in some parts of the afternoon sector, or very short (\u03bbf < 10\n\u25e6) elsewhere, with few94\nintermediate values.95\nTo examine the development of penetrating chorus, 4 rays are plotted in Figure 3.96\nColumns (A)-(D), correspond to rays injected at L = 4.45, f = 0.3fce, MLT = 9.5 h, AE97\n> 300 nT, with \u03c80 = \u22121\u03c8G, \u22120.65\u03c8G, 0.0\u03c8G, and +0.5\u03c8G respectively. The top row (a),98\nshows ray paths in red and wave normal vectors as short black line-segments attached99\nto the ray path. Rows (b) and (c) show the corresponding damping as a function of100\ngroup time, and \u03c8(\u03bb) respectively. For \u03c80 = \u2212\u03c8G the initial damping is very severe,101\nand \u03bbf = 2.9\n\u25e6. For \u03c80 = \u22120.65\u03c8G, although the initial Landau damping is relatively102\nstrong, it is substantially weaker than case (A), and avoids being extinguished close to103\nD R A F T May 29, 2007, 3:45pm D R A F T\nBORTNIK ET AL.: PENETRATING CHORUS X - 7\nits origin. The wave normal becomes field-aligned near \u03bb \u223c 18\u25e6 (no Landau damping),104\nand the wave power subsequently increases due to field line convergence. In addition, the105\nray propagates in such a way that \u03c8 remains low and the wave can reach the ionosphere106\napproximately field-aligned. When \u03c80 is increased further (columns (C),(D)), \u03c8(\u03bb) quickly107\nrotates anti-Earthward as it propagates, resulting in severe damping and decreasing \u03bbf .108\nOur results indicate that waves injected over a limited range of \u03c80 are able to avoid both109\nthe initial intense Landau damping (c.f. column (A)), and the mid-latitude damping (c.f.110\ncolumns (C) and (D)). From column (B) and Figure 2, the range of penetrating chorus111\ninitial angles is \u03c8P \u223c \u22120.8\u03c8G to \u22120.6\u03c8G. Moreover, the final wave normal angle \u03c8(\u03bbf )112\nis sensitively dependent upon \u03c80. At some critical angle \u03c8B (bifurcation angle [Thorne113\nand Kennel, 1967; Chum and Santolik, 2005]) within the \u03c8P range, \u03c8(\u03bbf ) \u223c 0\u25e6 (also close114\nto local vertical at high latitudes) and the ray is able (in principle) to propagate through115\nthe ionosphere to the ground. For \u03c80 < \u03c8B, \u03c8(\u03bbf ) becomes very oblique in the negative116\ndirection, whereas for \u03c80 > \u03c8B, \u03c8(\u03bbf ) becomes very oblique in the positive direction.117\nThis tendency of the rays to bifurcate at low altitudes based upon their initial \u03c8 has been118\nreported previously [Chum and Santolik, 2005; Santolik et al., 2006] and associated with119\nthe possible formation of ELF hiss at high latitudes, but inclusion of Landau damping120\nwith realistic suprathermal fluxes has not been considered until the present study.121\nAlthough the bulk of the chorus power corresponds to rays with \u03c80 \u223c 0\u25e6 [Bortnik et al.,122\n2007], chorus is nevertheless routinely observed with high \u03c8 at the source [Hayakawa et123\nal., 1990] and on low altitude spacecraft (e.g., Santolik et al., [2006]). An example from the124\nDEMETER satellite is shown in Figure 4, observed at an altitude of 709 km. Panels (a)-(d)125\nD R A F T May 29, 2007, 3:45pm D R A F T\nX - 8 BORTNIK ET AL.: PENETRATING CHORUS\nshow the magnetic and electric power spectrograms, and k-vector angles (\u03c8BK, azimuth126\nangle relative to +B, \u03c6BK, zenith angle measured anticlockwise relative to +B with 0\n\u25e6\n127\npointing to higher L-shells). The chorus elements contain significant electromagnetic wave128\npower, have clearly propagated to much higher latitudes than typical chorus waves, and129\nhave \u03c8BK \u223c 30\u25e6, similar to the values obtained in Figure 2, column (B). The ray tracing130\nshown in the present paper, as well as previous studies [Chum and Santolik, 2005] confirms131\nthat these waves are penetrating chorus.132\n4. Implications for particle scattering\nFigure 3 row (d) shows the resonant energies of electrons near the edge of the loss-cone133\nfor each ray as a function of latitude [e.g., Bortnik et al., 2006b, Eq. (2)]. Included are co-134\nstreaming cyclotron resonances m = \u22125 to \u22121 (red), the co-streaming Landau resonance135\nm = 0 (black), and counter-streaming resonances m = 1\u2212 5 (blue). The dominant m = 1136\nresonance is shown as the thick blue line in each of the plots.137\nTo indicate regions of field-aligned propagation (and hence most efficient wave-particle138\ninteraction), we chose an arbitrary limit of |\u03c8| = 30\u25e6, and highlighted this region for139\neach ray in rows (c) and (d). As shown, penetrating chorus (B) readily resonates with140\nMeV electrons at \u03bb \u223c 30\u25e6 with \u03c8 \u2264 30\u25e6, and may thus contribute to the formation of141\nrelativistic electron microbursts [Lorentzen et al., 2001] which have been shown to be142\nan effective radiation-belt loss mechanism [Thorne et al., 2005]. We note that if the143\nwave frequency is decreased (not shown), a greater range of \u03c80 will be able to access144\nhigh latitudes and scatter MeV electrons into the loss-cone, contributing to microburst145\nD R A F T May 29, 2007, 3:45pm D R A F T\nBORTNIK ET AL.: PENETRATING CHORUS X - 9\nformation, but chorus wave power simultaneously decreases and essentially vanishes below146\nf \u223c 0.1fce.147\n5. Conclusions\nUsing ray tracing and suprathermal electron distributions from the CRRES satellite,148\nthe final propagation latitudes \u03bbf of typical chorus rays have been calculated as a function149\nof L, MLT, AE, and \u03c80. While the bulk of chorus wave power was previously shown to be150\nconsistent with rays injected at \u03c80 = 0\n\u25e6 [Bortnik et al., 2007], the present study shows that151\nrays initiated within a certain range of wave normals \u03c8P \u223c \u22120.8\u03c8G to \u22120.6\u03c8G are able152\nto propagate to very high latitudes and low altitudes (\u2018penetrating chorus\u2019). Penetrating153\nchorus avoids the initial large damping associated with large oblique \u03c8 by quickly rotating154\ntowards \u03c8 \u223c 0\u25e6, and also avoids the large damping at mid-latitudes associated with \u03c8155\nrotating to oblique values. In addition, the relative wave power of penetrating chorus156\nmay increase above its initial value due to magnetic field line convergence. An example of157\nchorus waves observed on the DEMETER satellite at an altitude of 709 km was presented,158\nconsistent with penetrating chorus.159\nBy considering 4 representative ray paths with f = 0.3fce, it was shown that penetrat-160\ning chorus can resonate efficiently with electrons in the > 1 MeV range, and may thus161\ncontribute to the previously reported relativistic electron microbursts.162\nFinally, since penetrating chorus is able to propagate to low altitudes with \u03c8 \u223c 0\u25e6,163\nthe chorus observed on the ground does not necessarily need to be guided in field-aligned164\nducts, but can propagate entirely in an unducted mode. The bifurcation of wave normal165\nangles (and thus ray directions) at low altitudes may further lead to connections with166\nD R A F T May 29, 2007, 3:45pm D R A F T\nX - 10 BORTNIK ET AL.: PENETRATING CHORUS\nother waves types (e.g., ELF hiss) as suggested by Parrot et al., 2004, Chum and Santolik167\n[2005], and Santolik et al.
