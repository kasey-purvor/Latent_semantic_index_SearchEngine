Cronin (2008) \u2018Calculative spaces: cities, market relations and the commercial \nvitalism of the outdoor advertising industry\u2019, Environment and Planning A, volume 40, \npages 2734-2750 \n \n \nAbstract \n \nBased on ethnographic work, this article examines the market research practices of the \noutdoor advertising industry in the UK and their commercial production of space. I \nfocus on the role of calculation in the performance of market relations between a range \nof actors in the field and the use of marketing research\u2019s classificatory practices as a \ncurrency which enacts those relations. In many accounts of urban governance, city \nspace is produced by various statistical and classificatory devices as calculable and \nhence governable. But with recent developments in commercial enterprises, the \nperformative quality of market relations engenders calculative space, a nexus of people-\nin-space, commercial imperatives, and a calculative energy or orientation to calculation. \nThis is understood by the industry as a kind of commercial vitalism - an enlivening of \nmarket relations and of objects of commercial calculation - which firms aim to exploit \nby tapping into and channelling the energy they perceive it generates. \n \n \nIn framing his analysis of the production of space, Lefebvre remarks that scientific \nunderstandings of the material world have posited that energy, time and space must be neither \nconflated nor separated. But these understandings of materiality and physical energies that \nwere developed in physics and astronomy, he argues, must not exclude \u2018social energies\u2019 by \nmaintaining a distinction between \u2018\u201chuman\u201d and physical fields of force\u2019 (1991: 14). In effect, \n\u2018space considered in isolation is an empty abstraction; likewise energy and time\u2019 (1991: 12). \nMy concern in this paper is to explore this relationship of energy\u2013time\u2013space in relation to the \ncity and the market practices of the UK outdoor advertising industry using ethnographic \nmaterial generated from a recent project.1 I argue that in this nexus of relationships, the \nenergy that is held in a productive tension with time and space has a particular commercial \n                                                 \n1 The research was supported by ESRC grant number RES 000221744. The project involved 28 in-depth \ninterviews of 45-90 minutes with practitioners in a range of London-based media owning companies, media \nagencies, specialist poster agencies, trade associations, research companies and one client company. In addition, \ndata such as briefs, research questionnaires, research project results and PowerPoint presentations was collected \nfrom these companies. The project also involved a two-week ethnography with one media owner including \nobservation of directors\u2019 meetings, brainstorming and creative sessions, construction and presentations of \npitches, visits to clients and media agencies, staff training, and a range of in-depth interviews with staff. Other \nparts of the project involved a case study of the visual impact of outdoor advertising in Manchester. \n 1\ncharacter - or what I call a \u2018commercial vitalism\u2019 - that is closely linked to forms of \ncalculation. \nMany years ago Simmel noted the growing significance of calculation, particularly in \nrelation to the metropolis, the seat of the money economy: \n \nModern mind [sic] has become more and more calculating. The calculative exactness of \npractical life which the money economy has brought about corresponds to the ideal of \nnatural science: to transform the world into an arithmetic problem, to fix every part of \nthe world by mathematical formulas. Only money economy has filled the days of so \nmany people with weighing, calculating, with numerical determinations, with a \nreduction of qualitative values to quantitative ones \u2026. the conditions of metropolitan \nlife are at once cause and effect of this trait. \n(Simmel, 1997: 177) \n \nBut more recently, calculation and measurement in relation to market research and space have \nbeen understood rather more narrowly, predominantly in terms of the practices of classifying \ngroups of people or spaces using various geodemographic apparatuses. Such studies tend to \nemphasize the apparent reach, power and ambition of marketing and its associated knowledge \npractices. Goss, for instance, argues that the spatial marketing technique of geodemographics \naims to order and manage diversity and is based on \u2018an instrumental rationality that desires to \nbring the processes of consumption further under the control of the regime of production\u2019 \n(1995: 172). In parallel, Gandy (1993: 2) sees the contemporary emphasis on various forms of \ndata collection and ordering as a \u2018panoptic sort\u2019 which classifies people according to their \neconomic value and functions as \u2018an extension of technical rationalization into the social \nrealm of the consumer and political behavior\u2019. For Elmer (2004: 49), the \u2018everyday data \neconomy\u2019 is a powerful calculative formation in which geographical data are used to create \nmaps simulating space-time relations which are then deployed to govern consumption. Many \naccounts emphasise the drive to classify, or what Lyon (2002: 3) calls the \u2018phenetic fix\u2019, and \nattribute great power and scope to such classificatory practices and technologies. Such \nanalyses broadly follow Weber\u2019s (1967) understanding of bureaucracy and rationalisation in \nwhich the generation of multiform measurements, calculations and representations facilitates \ncentral control and order. Other accounts take a more Foucaultian approach to spatiality, \nfocusing on how various mappings have produced cities, their early \u2018paper rationality\u2019 \n 2\nimagining cities as collectives entities (Joyce, 2003: 55) and subjecting them to forms of \ngovernance (Osborne and Rose, 1999). In such understandings, \n \nnumbers and other \u2018inscription devices\u2019, actually constitute the domains they appear to \nrepresent; they render them representable in a docile form \u2013 a form amenable to the \napplication of calculation and deliberation. \n(Rose, 1999: 198) \n \nThe stress on the role of classification, and particularly marketing data, in producing and \nmaintaining a social order is in part shaped by the fact that most accounts analyse the archives \nand technologies of production (databases etc), and their products (maps, classificatory tables \netc). It is perhaps unsurprising that readings of these objects of research might emphasise their \nomniscience and power, mirroring the claims generated by the technologies\u2019 producers. But if \nwe look at the articulation and performance of such ideals, technologies and products in the \nactual practices of marketing research we can see a more complex picture in which the status \nof that data is more ambiguous. As John Law reminds us, there are no orders but orderings \nand these are \u2018more or less precarious accomplishments that may be overturned\u2019 (1994: 1-2). \nSuch orderings and classificatory schemes tend to take the form of representations such as \nmaps but, as Bowker and Star (1999) note, they can take material as well as symbolic form \nand are embedded in a range of physical entities such as paper forms and software \ninstructions encoded in silicon.  \nYet such schemes, alongside a form of calculative drive, are also embedded in the \ncommercial relationships between various actors in the field. Indeed, some accounts propose a \nmore expansive view of calculation including processes of the classification (or \n\u2018qualification\u2019) of products and these practices\u2019 role in actively constituting markets (Callon, \n1998). In my ethnographic work, there was ample evidence of commercial calculation in \nrelation to the classification of people and products in the industry\u2019s market research \npractices. But what also emerged was a broader range of calculative actions \u2013 or \u2018commercial \nexperiments\u2019 \u2013 that performed or enacted market relations between the various actors in the \nfield. As the industry\u2019s product is, in effect, space \u2013 space on advertising billboards and \npanels \u2013 the performance of such practices is spatialised in ways that have yet to be fully \nexamined in studies of the city. Recent accounts have sought to understand the constitution of \ncities by flows and rhythms of information (Castells, 2000), of capital (Harvey, 1989), of \nsocial relations (Lefebvre, 1991), of emotions and affect (Pile 2005), of ruination and \n 3\nmemories (Edensor, 2005), of technologies (Thrift, 2005), of images (Liggett, 2003), and of \nnetworks of infrastructures (Graham and Marvin, 2001). But far less attention has been \ndirected at the production of urban space by the practices of marketing.2 It is this nexus of \ncommercial energy\u2013time\u2013space that forms the focus of this paper. \nAfter describing the nature of the UK\u2019s outdoor advertising industry, the first section \nof this paper explores the industry\u2019s conceptualisation of urban space and its relation to the \nmedia owners\u2019 products (space on outdoor advertising sites). The second section examines the \nnature of the commercial experiments that enact the field of the outdoor advertising industry. \nThe paper then goes on to explore the calculative energies or commercial vitalism evident in \nthe market research practices of the industry. I conclude by arguing that these market research \npractices produce not only demographic classifications of people and spaces (or more \nprecisely, taxonomies of \u2018people-and-space\u2019) and actively constitute a specific set of market \nrelationships, but also perform the city as \u2018calculative space\u2019.  \n \n \nThe industry and the city \n \nA specialist sub-field of advertising, the outdoor advertising industry trades in producing and \nselling spaces on which to advertise outdoors (or \u2018out of home\u2019). Media owners such as \nJ.C.Decaux, Clear Channel Outdoor, CBS Outdoor (formerly Viacom), Titan and Primesight \nconstruct and maintain poster sites including billboards by the side of roads, panels in \npedestrian zones, and underground train and bus advertising sites. They also have contracts \nwith local councils whereby they construct and maintain bus shelters or other amenities in \nreturn for the right to sell advertising space on them. They sell space to clients via the \nintermediaries of media agencies or specialist poster companies such as Posterscope and \nKinetic which assess the client\u2019s needs and buy a suitable package of advertising space from \nthe media owners. Market research companies are commissioned by media owners to produce \ndata to use as a pitch to help them sell space or to assess a campaign\u2019s impact after it has been \nposted.3 \nWithin this nexus of relationships calculation plays a central role. The generation and \ncirculation of marketing data forms an agreed currency: media owners continually generate \n\u2018pitches\u2019 in PowerPoint presentation form containing various types of market research data \n                                                 \n2 There have, of course, been many studies of place marketing and the marketing of cities to attract tourists and \ninward investment (e.g. Hall and Hubbard, 1998; Kearns and Philo, 1998). \n3 Creative agencies produce the actual advertising content, but this element of the industry is not focus of this \npaper. \n 4\nwhich are presented, often in face-to-face meetings, to representatives of media agencies or \nspecialist poster agencies (or, more rarely, directly to client firms). These pitches aim to \npersuade that outdoor advertising is an excellent promotional medium or that a media owner\u2019s \nparticular portfolio of sites - perhaps the London Underground train system or large poster \nsites in petrol station forecourts - are best placed to target a particular audience. Media \nagencies take the PowerPoint presentations with their data-rich content and segment and \nreconstruct them, and then use them to pitch to clients who may wish to advertise. As I argue \nin later sections, the specific character of this market is produced and reproduced by the \nperformances of commercial relationships between these actors. In doing so, they enact both \nthese markets relations and a set of conceptualisations of urban space that come to be \nmaterialised. \n Odih and Knights (2000: 79) have argued that marketing knowledges have \u2018an \nunproblematic allegiance to positivist methods within an empiricist epistemology\u2019 and that, \n \nIt is axiomatic to this form of epistemology that \u2018time\u2019 and \u2018space\u2019 should be ascribed \nthe characteristics of abstract, quantifiable, singular units \u2026. \u2018Time\u2019 and \u2018space\u2019 are \nconceptualised as existing externally to the individual, in fixed rationally co-ordinated \nspheres. \n(Odih and Knights, 2000: 79) \n \nWhile this may be conceivable in the context of academic marketing discourses, this \ndescription jars with what I observed of the outdoor advertising industry\u2019s calculative \nknowledge practices. Despite the nature of their product \u2013 outdoor advertising sites that are \nalmost exclusively situated in or on key approaches to cities \u2013 \u2018the city\u2019 as a conceptual zone \ndoes not exist in the industry\u2019s repertoire of understandings. As an industry spokesman \nexplained to me, \u2018there is no interest in [the city as an] environment whatsoever. They\u2019re \ninterested in the numbers of people. The fact is that the numbers of people [just happen to be] \nin places called cities\u2019. This loose conceptualisation of spatiality was illustrated in the study \ntime and again - urban space was understood not as a fixed arrangement of specific locations \nbut as spaces and times of density, that is, densities of people which could be translated by \nmarket research\u2019s classificatory practices into \u2018target markets\u2019. The busy urban road, the \npedestrian shopping zone, the sides of buildings, buses moving along commuter routes, all \nfigure in the industry\u2019s understandings and mapping techniques not as cartographically \ndeterminate sites in a city. They are framed and quantified as time\u2013spaces through a standard \n 5\nindustry taxonomy which includes the metrics of \u2018Opportunity to See\u2019 and \u2018Visibility \nAdjusted Contacts\u2019. This taxonomy frames the classification of each advertising site \naccording the number of people who may see it (the density of visual contacts). The field of \norientation used by the industry focuses on core themes: \u2018centrality\u2019 (the density of flows of \npeople in and around a city centre will generate an intensity of \u2018hits\u2019); positioning in relation \nto flows of people (busy commuter routes will deliver large numbers of hits); scale (size is \nunderstood to translate into \u2018impactful\u2019 advertising and generates a range of its own \nclassifications such as \u2018super-sides\u2019 and \u2018mega-rears\u2019 in advertising on buses); contingent \nproximities (high street shops often advertise on the sides of buses which operate as mobile \nbillboards travelling through commercial centres). \n This is not a classic planners\u2019 view of city space as a range of discrete sites located in \ndeterminate grids and networks. Space is understood only as the support surface or medium \nfor moments of visual contact with potential consumers. Urban spaces take form or come to \nexist as a commercial reality only as flexible resources, that is, as quantifiable moments of \nencounter with potential consumers moving in that space. These are translated and sold as \nopportunities for \u2018conversations\u2019 with them about products and services, or as chances for \nbrands to inhabit people\u2019s lives by sharing their everyday space. In these senses, \u2018the city\u2019 as \nunderstood by social scientists is clearly the context for the industry\u2019s activities. These \nactivities contribute in turn to producing urban space by impacting upon the imagescapes of \ncities, marking routes of densities of people and modes of transport, and producing and \ncirculating market research about such spaces. But the nature of \u2018the city\u2019, a question so \nintensely debated in academia, does not feature as a point of reference for the industry. Only \nwhen prompted will industry practitioners even mention the city and then only as a category \nthat is not relevant to their commercial practices. As the director of research at a major media \nowner explained, \n \nI\u2019ve got panels at 450 of their supermarkets and a third of the UK population visit them, \nand one of Tesco\u2019s stores is 100,000 sq ft, it\u2019s a quarter of a mile long and it\u2019s got an \niPod department store within it. Is that a city? \n \nSo while much recent social theory has posited space as a product of social relations not a \nneutral, empty container, this has for many years been a practical truism for the outdoor \nadvertising industry which understands space only and insofar as it relates to people \ninhabiting, moving in and acting upon it. Central to their understandings is the role of \n 6\ncalculation. But space is not just where commercial calculation happens (the space of the \norganisation; the space of urban centres of the advertising industry) or the product of their \nmarketing activities; it constitutes a productive nexus of energy\u2013time\u2013space, similar to \nLefebvre\u2019s formation: \u2018though a product to be used, to be consumed, [social space] is also a \nmeans of production; networks of exchange and flows of raw materials and energy fashion \nspace and are determined by it\u2019 (1991: 85, original emphasis). Space is understood and \nenacted in the industry as fluid, lived, contingent; what would be conventionally considered a \ncity or urban space is understood and worked upon as a complex of energy\u2013time\u2013space. As I \nexplore in the following section, this is enacted as \u2018commercial experiments.\u2019 \n \n \nCommercial experiments \n \nIn this section I draw on Thrift\u2019s understanding of performance as that which \u2018holds \norganizations together and pushes them on\u2019 and involves \u2018an ability to act convincingly into \nthe situation that presents itself by taking whatever propensity for dynamism may be offered \nthat is also a practical ethic of discovery and invention\u2019 (2006: 144). Within this broad \nframework of performances, I identify \u2018commercial experiments\u2019 in the advertising industry \nas a specific set of performances that are linked to calculation. Below I examine how practices \nof calculation \u2013 about the characteristics of potential consumers, about numbers of these \nconsumers that can be reached, and about fruitful commercial relationships between actors in \nthe field \u2013 are experimental in a twofold fashion. Firstly, for media owners they constitute a \ncontinual process of trial and error to identify what forms of classification or which \npromotional pitches will have traction with particular clients at particular times. Such \nexperiments are thus oriented towards making efficacious market relationships. Such \nexperiments are framed by the central issue of advertising\u2019s effects (although not, as we shall \nsee, by a simple calculation of whether certain advertising will sell goods or services). \nSecondly, these performances are experimental in that they alter the elements involved in the \ncalculative process as well as altering the process itself; they are alchemies of commercial \nspaces, times and energies. These are modes of production of space, in Lefebvre\u2019s terms, that \nenact complex relationships and produce some surprising results. \n Market relationships between media owners, media agencies, research companies and \nclient firms are continually performed and the maintenance of these relationships is carefully \ntended. For instance, despite having no immediate interest in a particular sales pitch, media \nowners will attend presentations by research companies which are promoting their new ideas, \n 7\nresearch data or targeting strategies in order to maintain the relationship for future \ncollaborations. In commercial relationships deemed productive, this courtesy is of course \nreciprocated. In the performance of market relations in my study, the marketing data and \ncreative pitches that are continually produced and circulated function primarily to structure \nand maintain particular commercial relationships. Constituting more than a mere competition \nwithin a market, marketing is here a competition over the very structure of markets and the \nnature of market relations (see Slater, 2002a). This performance of commercial relationships \nand its calculative nature revealed itself to be subtle and complex, involving a currency of \ncommercial knowledges in which classification and calculation (of potential consumers; of \nspaces they move in; of useful commercial relationships) formed an \u2018economy of qualities\u2019 \n(Callon, M\u00e9adel and Rabeharisoa, 2002: 202) or nexus of continually shifting orderings. \nThe commercial relationships in the advertising industry are framed by the thorny \nissue of cause and effect, or the impact of advertising on sales. This is one of the key factors \nthat gives a specific character and orientation to the industry\u2019s commercial experiments. It is \nrecognised both in the industry itself and in academic studies that advertising\u2019s impact on \nsales is a highly ambiguous area that is performed by claim and counter-claim in a highly \ncompetitive arena (Alvesson, 1994; Kover and Goldberg, 1995; Lury and Warde, 1997; \nMiller, 1997; Schudson, 1993, Tunstall, 1964). The majority of actors in my recent and \nprevious studies (Cronin, 2004a, 2004b, 2004c, 2006) believe that it is impossible to prove a \ndirect, unequivocal causal link between advertising campaigns and sales of goods or services, \nciting the problems of distinguishing the effects of advertising from other promotional \nactivities (e.g. pricing, packaging, promotional events) and extraneous factors including \nconsumer trends and even the impact of the weather (for instance, on sales of summer \nclothing). This ambiguity is a central feature of the industry in which, as Cochoy argues, \nmarketing\u2019s \u2018performances are hard to describe, complex to evaluate, and difficult to measure \nempirically\u2019(1998: 217). \n This appreciation of advertising\u2019s ambiguous impact is distributed among the various \nactors in the sector. Research companies specialising in both qualitative and quantitative \nresearch reported that producers of goods and services who commissioned them were \nthemselves rather vague about advertising\u2019s effect on \u2018sales uplift\u2019. This weak impact is \nmirrored in the industry\u2019s research findings of people\u2019s recall of specific advertisements. \nResearch companies fairly consistently find in post-campaign research that the numbers of \npeople who recall a client\u2019s advertising are generally small. For instance, in a bespoke post-\ncampaign research project on plasma screen advertising for an internet company in London \n 8\nUnderground train stations, a research company in my study found that only 4% of people \nquestioned recalled any advertising at all in the tube station in which they were interviewed. \nAnd it is generally recognised that even accurate recall of a brand or advertising message does \nnot straightforwardly translate into increased sales. The research director of an outdoor \nspecialist firm noted that with regard to advertising\u2019s effects on sales, \u2018We\u2019re slightly in the \ndark with a lot of this\u2019. One marketing communications agency, Young and Rubicam, \ncommissioned research on advertising effects which employed econometrics, a modelling \ntechnique often used by clients to assess the impact of various factors on sales figures: \n \nWe actually hired a proper econometrician to try to look at the input of advertising, and \nunfortunately what we found was something we didn\u2019t really want to know which was \nthat the variance that you could directly attribute to the input of advertising wasn\u2019t large \nenough to be statistically relevant. Whoops! \n(POSTAR spokesperson, previously employed by Young and Rubicam) \n \nAs this informant reported to me, following this inconvenient finding industry practitioners \nstrategically altered the model so that they could attribute more impact to various forms of \ncommunication such as PR and advertising. In the industry, then, this ambiguity translates \ninto a flexible and nuanced understanding of cause and effect and the validity of research \ndata. Market research data and figures about advertising\u2019s direct impact on sales are viewed as \nless than accurate but this does not mean that they are seen as failing or invalid. With a \nparticular focus on accountancy and its practices of producing calculable spaces, Peter Miller \nargues that \u2018economic calculation is a congenitally \u201cfailing\u201d operation\u2019 in that the \ntechnologies of specific fields such as accountancy \u2013 and, we might add, marketing \u2013 \u2018often \nintersect poorly with the specifics of \u201cthe real\u201d\u2019 (1994: 257). But this failure, he argues, does \nnot constitute a problem for commerce: highlighting the inadequacies of one calculative \nmodel or technology facilitates the task of consultants in selling new ones to clients as there is \na deeply rooted sense that commercial problems can be solved if only firms had the \nappropriate calculative tools. \nFor Miller, it appears that certain calculative models\u2019 \u2018failings\u2019 and their replacement \nwith newer models merely serves to illustrate the structuring efficiency of the overarching \nframework of the market which seeks out and exploits gaps for innovation and hence \nopportunities to generate profit. But what other avenues for research are opened if, as in \nBurrows and Gane\u2019s (2006) study, we ask not if geodemographic techniques of research and \n 9\nclassification are accurate, but what work they do in the industry? What if these calculative \n\u2018failings\u2019 identified by Miller are part not of a pre-set \u2018logic\u2019 of the market (as an abstract, \nover-arching or framing entity), but of a range of commercial experiments that continually \nperform market relations? What commercial realities do they enact? The issue of cause and \neffect in the industry is not, then, simply a \u2018problem\u2019 which constantly risks sliding into \n\u2018failure\u2019: flexible understandings of cause and effect, or the impact of advertising on sales, \nhold a central role in performing this set of market relations. \nIn these performances, this loose coupling of cause and effect produces a flexible \nrelation to data and the calculative nature of commercial experiments. There is a continual \nproduction of classifications which are not understood to be referentially accurate but to be \ncommercially useful. To give just one example, a 2005 survey was commissioned by a large \nmedia owner of advertising space in the London Underground and on buses. It aimed to \nexplore the lifestyles of various social groups, their spending habits and their movement and \ntravel patterns. This material was then used by the media owner to pitch itself to clients by \npromoting its capacity to understand and efficiently target potential consumers. The study was \nbased on just over 1000 internet-based interviews of adults aged 16-55 living or working in \nLondon. It identifies, and classifies, its respondents as 60% ABC1 and 40% C2DE and then \nmore precisely as: \n \n\u2018culture fashionistas\u2019 (88% aged 16-34; 41% AB \u2013 cool jobs, high status; probably \nwork in media related jobs; client-facing business people who entertain on an expenses \naccount; very well groomed with a keen interest in toiletries and cosmetics; very tech \nsavvy \u2013 they are hi-fi and audio connoisseurs, with a good looking mobile phone in \ntheir pocket); \u2018Bonkies - big bonus, no kids\u2019 (68% ABC1, 35% social grade AB - good \njobs; square mile glamour couples with a double income; streetwise high flyers; they \nbelieve their choice of car says a lot about them; they embrace new technology and \ngadgetry, particularly computers and hi-fi & audio); \u2018Fair trade creatives\u2019 (72% aged \n16-34; 74% ABC1 - okay jobs; very politically aware \u2013 look to Europe in terms of a \nsocial model; strong consideration for their own emotions and feelings \u2013 and probably \nother people\u2019s too; more of an emphasis on comfort - less formal more leisure \norientated dress; their fashion sense is probably more influenced by music \u2013 wearing the \nlikes of Camper shoes, anti-fit jeans and Puma); \u2018Backbone of London\u2019 (55% C1C2 - \nhardworking mid-market; traditional gender roles; know who they are and what\u2019s \nimportant \u2013 they stick to their principles and values; probably shop at major high street \n 10\nchains \u2013 Next and Debenhams); \u2018Goldie lookin tool kit\u2019 [sic] (62% aged 16-34; 70% \nmale; 70% C1C2DE; sport \u2013 both playing and watching is a key focus in their lives; \ntheir C1C2 SEG means they probably work in skilled manual trades; they have a keen \ninterest in cars); \u2018Domestic goddesses\u2019 (57% ABC1; 69% women; 49% married; 59% \nhave children; shopping is both a necessity and a pleasure \u2013 particularly window \nshopping); \u2018The Royle Family\u2019 (57% C2DE; 25% unemployed or homemaker; little or \nno disposable income; very \u2018stay-at-home\u2019 \u2013 they rarely travel out of their house or \nlocal area). \n \nThese classifications will change from project to project and will reflect the commercial \nimperatives of the moment, such as the targeting of a particular set of new clients, rather than \naccurately mirroring some external reality (in the manner of an \u2018academic study\u2019, as the \nindustry understands such a distinction). But it is crucial that such data have commercial \ntraction in that they must facilitate an efficient performance of commercial relationships. As a \nsenior industry practitioner commented, \n \nIn advertising and marketing services people use data in the most amazing ways, and it \nwill not necessarily stand up to scrutiny. You know, hey, maybe that\u2019s not what anyone \nin the marketing services industry wants\u2026 They want to be roughly right rather than \nprecisely wrong. \n \nTo be \u2018roughly right\u2019 here translates as \u2018sufficiently valid\u2019, that is, capable of contributing to \nthe performances of commercial relationships in ways which benefit all parties. We can see \nthis dynamic operating clearly in the use of research data as a decision-support technology. \nThe currency of market research data organises and stabilises the exchanges between media \nowners, media agencies and specialist agencies, and client companies in a range of complex \nways including as a decision-support technology. I observed many instances of media owners \ncreating pitches to present to clients on the basis of \u2018gut-feeling\u2019 or intuition \u2013 about what \ndirection a brand should go; the most appropriate format for outdoor advertisements to \ncomplement television campaigns; selecting the most \u2018impactful\u2019 format for the campaign, \nsuch as bus advertising or sponsoring an event; finding a creative \u2018hook\u2019 to appeal to both \nclients and their consumers. Often it is only at this stage that practitioners will search various \n 11\nindustry databases such as TGI or NVision4 for specific quantitative or qualitative data to \nsupport their approach \u2013 \u2018nugget-hunting\u2019 as one practitioner at a research company called it, \na tendency noted to be prevalent in marketing (see Hackley, 2001). As one senior industry \npractitioner describes, \u2018most of the decisions in advertising are made by intuition. So they \nwant a bit of data to support their pre-formed prejudices\u2019. This intuition is based on their \ncommercial experience, ideas circulating in the trade press or in the practitioner accounts \npublished by the \u2018great men\u2019 of advertising (e.g. Bullmore, 1991; Fletcher, 1999; Ogilvy, \n1964, 1983), companies\u2019 archives of previous campaigns, practitioners\u2019 own experience as \nconsumers, and a more general notion of \u2018creative insight\u2019. The sourcing of data is thus an \neclectic process with an emphasis on novelty, as the Research Director at a specialist media \nagency put it, \u2018We pull it from all sources\u2026. I suppose it\u2019s like the magpie effect, really.  We \ntake anything that\u2019s shiny, anything that\u2019s shiny and new we\u2019ll take\u2019. Indeed, media owners \nuse a diverse range of sources such as standard marketing databases, Google, and online news \nsites to provide details to support their gut feeling or to post-rationalise a particular pitch. \nThis decision-support function also works at the level of the client. As a research \ncompany worker explained, practitioners at the client firm may require qualitative research on \na particular advertising campaign which assesses not so much impact on sales as the general \ntone of the campaign: \u2018it\u2019s reassurance and testing that you\u2019ve got it right\u2019. And on all levels \u2013 \nwithin media owner firms, media agencies and brand managers at client firms \u2013 practitioners \nare oriented by personal interests, most notably their fear of losing their job due to inadequate \nperformance. Research data can thus be used as an alibi for decisions made. The spokesperson \nof POSTAR, an industry body that monitors the numbers of people passing poster sites, \nexplained that with the use of official industry figures, \u2018at the very least you won\u2019t lose your \njob because I\u2019m going to provide you with statistical data that says, you know, \u201cnot me, guv \u2013 \nthe figures said it was ok\u201d\u2019. Thus, figures are often used not to direct but to support decisions \non a range of levels, such as to post-rationalise a client pitch or to provide a statistical alibi for \nbrand managers at client firms should a campaign appear not have the intended effect on \nsales. \nThis performance of specific market relationships, and the example of the use of data \nas a decision-support technology, is an explicit and accepted characteristic of the industry \u2013 \nindeed, one company providing market research software is called \u2018Decisions Made Easy\u2019. \n                                                 \n4 Within the industry, the databases are themselves seen as flawed. Research companies frequently commented \non the poor quality of the questionnaires used to generate the data. But they are nevertheless used as currency \nbecause as one practitioner put it, \u2018they\u2019re the best we\u2019ve got\u2019. \n 12\nResearch data is seen as a malleable resource and its reference to \u2018the real world\u2019 is \nunderstood as flexible and strategic. For instance, the research director at a specialist agency \ncommented that he often held back from investigating data too closely as clients do not really \nwant you to \u2018mess with\u2019 their established understanding of outdoor advertising.5 These modes \nof calculation, measurement and the presentation of data are thus best seen as commercial \nexperiments. Their defining characteristic is not their \u2018failure\u2019 to capture the world, for \ninstance, in the ambiguous impact of advertising on sales; the small numbers of people \nrecalling ads; the sketchy marketing classifications of people or certain spaces or routes in \nthose spaces. Certainly, this dynamic enables media owners, media agencies and research \ncompanies to offer new solutions to clients as Miller (1994) suggests. But these experiments \nor calculations do more than this. They continually act to constitute market relationships on a \nmicro level: instead of failing, they are productive of a functional network of commercial \nrelationships that cohere sufficiently across time to enable that company to make money.6 \n \n \n \nCommercial vitalism and creative insight \n \nBut the commercial experiments of the industry do not operate solely on the level of decision-\nsupport or post-rationalisation \u2013 they have a strategic orientation to the future. In effect, they \nare experiments with time that are fundamentally spatialised and involve forms of calculative \nenergy. How the various actors in the industry understand their calculative practices is highly \nsignificant. As I describe below, they conceptualise their practices of calculation, alongside \nthe performance of their commercial relationships, as a kind of commercial vitalism. These \nreflexive understandings impact upon the industry because they come to be recursively \nincorporated into the form of their commercial practices and in turn into the performance of \nurban spaces as calculative spaces. \nVitalism as a non-humanistic life force or energy has a long genealogy associated with \nthe work of Bergson, Simmel and Deleuze amongst others (see Lash, 2006). Characterising \nunderstandings of a new vitalism, Fraser, Kember and Lury (2005) emphasize process and \nbecoming over being, in which process is seen as a radical relationality through which entities \n                                                 \n5 Why client companies should continue to advertise despite understanding advertising effects as at best \nindeterminate has been explored elsewhere (Cronin, 2004a, 2004b; Miller, 1997). \n6A parallel understanding of this commercial dynamic could be produced by the concept of virtualism developed \nby Carrier and Miller (1998) and extended by Leyshon, French, Thrift, Crewe and Webb (2005). Rather than \nmerely representing the world, economic abstractions (or theories) contribute to constituting the world. But, they \nargue, actors\u2019 practices must also be considered as they act to constitute such abstractions. \n \n 13\nare constituted. The significance of relationality in thinking about (and through) process is \nthat, \n \nit acts as a \u2018lure for life\u2019, an enticement to move beyond the conflation of life with the \n(life) sciences, to conceive life as not confined to living organisms, but as movement, a \nradical becoming.  \n(Fraser, Kember and Lury, 2005: 3) \n \nThe outdoor advertising industry produces and feeds off an understanding of its own practices \nas a form of commercial vitalism (or a creative enlivening of their market practices and \nmarket relationships). In doing so, the industry enacts and exploits an energy\u2013time\u2013space that \nis made up of knowledges, practices, city space, and commercial ideals of \u2018target markets\u2019 \nthat are all oriented to the future. It comes to imagine and inhabit commercial futures as they \nare performed spatially through the vital processes and radical relationality of its own \npractices. I am not suggesting that there is an ontology of the market (based on a commercial \nvitalism or other characteristic). Rather, I am arguing that the industry\u2019s own understandings \nof its practices and market relationships as a form of commercial vitalism have a significant \nimpact on how market relations are made and remade, and on the production of urban space.7 \nTo ensure its on-going financial viability, the industry has to be adept at understanding \nthe economic and cultural moment in order to respond to it. The advertising industry is thus \npart of a capitalism that is \u2018a means of crafting the moment\u2019 (Thrift, 1998: 164). Here, firms \nare as \u2018uncertain about the future as we all are because the future unfolds as a virtuality \u2013 it is \ncontinually creating temporary actualizations out of new questions \u2013 not a known quantity\u2019 \n(Thrift, 2005: 4). This \u2018moment\u2019 is multiform and indeterminate, and as various \ncommentators have noted, is marked by complexity and non-linear manifestations of change \n                                                 \n7 Although beyond the scope of this paper, it is interesting to note how agencies pitch themselves to clients using \nthe notion of the \u2018energy\u2019 of brands (in ways which aim to brand the agency as innovative and skilled in \ncommercial calculation). For instance, a marketing communications agency called Young and Rubicam \npromotes itself as an expert in identifying and channelling this energy, a form of energy they conceive as having \nan orientation to the future: \u2018Some brands are so filled with energy, that they don\u2019t just move. They move the \nmarket. Brands with energy are surprising and innovative. Constantly reinventing themselves. Setting the \nstandard for their category. They\u2019re where consumers are \u2013 and they\u2019re headed where consumers want to be. At \nY&R we invested heavily in understanding this energy phenomenon, using our proprietary BrandAsset\u00ae \nValuator. And we discovered that Energy\u2122 is a quantifiable value in a brand. Only Y&R can measure it. We \nknow what brands have Energy\u2122. We know how much they have. And why they have it. At Y&R Energy\u2122 is \nnot only what we know. It\u2019s what we do. Y&R. We Energise Business\u2019. \nhttp:\/\/www.yr.com\/. Accessed 3\/6\/07. \n \n 14\n(Bauman, 2000; Urry, 2000). In such a context the understandings of the temporality of \nconsequences are altered such that,  \n \nthe decision-making process becomes dominated by the expectation of unexpected side-\neffects. When this goes so far as to reverse the sequence of decision-making \u2013 when the \nexpectation of unexpected consequences precedes the decision itself \u2013 then, in the \nlanguage of economics, externalities have been internalized\u2026. The result is that the \nmore we know, the more our facts, decisions and objects become dominated by the \nunexpected consequences that are now an integral part of them.  \n(Beck, Bonss and Lau, 2003: 21) \n \nIn the outdoor advertising industry, the unexpected or indeterminate has long been a key \nfactor that organises its internal market relations, particularly in the form of the ambiguous \nrelationship of advertising to sales discussed above. But more than this, the data gathered in \nmy study suggests that the industry reflexively aims to become part of these virtual futures by \nasking new questions \u2013 to become part of the performing of those futures \u2013 by trying to \nharness what they see as the creative, commercial energies or vitalism produced in that \nperformance (which in turns shapes the performances of its own market relationships). The \nindustry\u2019s practical rationality is not purely limited to short-term, easily defined benefits, but \nhas an orientation to the future and its yet unknown potential. Thus, the industry reflexively \nengages with the performative nature of capitalism and in doing so, the knowledge practices \nof the industry attempt to bring the future into the present. The commissioned research \nprojects and practitioners\u2019 redeployment of marketing data in the industry\u2019s databases is a \ncontinual iteration of the multiple and contradictory nature of people, places and \nconsumption: an ever-more refined classification of demographics; redefinitions of types or \nfamilies of commodities and services; social trends in travel, work and leisure patterns; \nmarket share of advertising by television, the internet, the press. Projects and data are \ncontinually updated, recycled, redeployed, their usefulness defined not in terms of precision \nor referential accuracy but as technologies of crafting the moment, of organising knowledge \nand resources to most profitably inhabit that moment and be best placed to ask the next set of \nquestions which perform temporary actualisations. \nFor the outdoor advertising industry, such experiments involve engaging the \nindustry\u2019s actors in performing a certain set of commercial futures \u2013 on one level, media \nowners, media agencies and specialist agencies, research companies and client companies \n 15\nalign their actions to ensure optimum performance and reward. These performances act to \nconstitute a market or economic field. For instance the trade body, The Institute of \nPractitioners in Advertising (IPA), has recently attempted to produce a common currency of \nresearch data and consumer classifications, or \u2018single source survey and multi-channel \nplanning system\u2019, called \u2018Touchpoints\u2019 based on a survey of 5000 adults in the UK. The \nsubjects were given PDA diaries for 7 days to record their daily practices including a focus on \nlifestyle, media consumption, travel patterns, and time spent outdoors. This initiative was \ndesigned to formulate and stabilise the field of advertising relationships, but it constitutes a \nfinely balanced dynamic in which the stabilisation of the field of the market is set in a \nproductive tension with the drive for internal competition. Thus, there are continual attempts \nto destabilise or reinterpret market relations by companies which aim to achieve a \u2018point of \ndifference\u2019 or competitive advantage by claiming new market research techniques, new \ntechnological advances in outdoor sites (e.g. Bluetooth enabled posters for consumer \ninteraction), or a monopoly on product types such as a contract to sell advertising space on the \nUnderground train system in London.8  The research director of a specialist media agency \ndescribes this dynamic: \n \nProprietary thinking, proprietary tools, proprietary insight from industry systems that \nexist, that\u2019s important because it creates individuality and point of difference and it\u2019s \nwhat generates business and why you are more successful or less successful than your \ncompetitors. \n \nThe production of difference both as a taxonomic currency of potential consumers and spaces \nand as competitive leverage is central to the market. But while Lyon\u2019s (2002: 3) phrase, the \n\u2018phenetic fix\u2019, elegantly captures this drive to classify and materialise those classifications as \ncommercial realities, it fails to encompass the way in which the industry orients itself toward \ncommercial futures in a manner which exceeds often loosely conceived ideas of \u2018innovation\u2019. \nIndeed, for many accounts of market research\u2019s classificatory practices such as Elmer\u2019s \n(2004: 134), \u2018to profile is to attempt to account for the unknown\u2019. But capturing the unknown \nis only part of the story. Based on the constant production of market research data and \ncommercial mappings, these performances of market relations should be seen not merely as \n                                                 \n8 On market stabilisation and destabilisation see Slater (2002b). \n \n 16\nattempts to exploit the present: they are open-ended, reflexive attempts to be part of \nperforming the horizon of commercial reality that acts to bring market relations into being. \nThis sense was articulated by practitioners most often as \u2018creative insight\u2019, a \ngalvanising concept that organised their everyday practices. Whilst creativity is a staple \nconcept in the advertising industry more generally, it has less traction amongst media owners, \nthat is, the group which formed the focus of my study. Trading space and market research on \nthat space constitutes the core of their activities, and while it is true that intensified \ncompetition in the industry has recently forced media owners to engage in more \u2018creative\u2019 \nwork (e.g. mocking up posters to sell the concept of outdoor advertising to specific clients), \ncreativity is generally seen as the remit of \u2018creative agencies\u2019 (those that generate the textual \ncontent of advertisements). In the media owners\u2019 sector of the industry, \u2018creative insight\u2019 is \nused in a wide sense to indicate forms of knowing that are flexible, not rooted in conventional \ninterpretations of data, and are not strictly referential \u2013 they can be seen as \u2018vital knowledges\u2019 \nin which \u2018creativity\u2019 is the vital energy that drives them. \nThis was most clearly evident in my study in the prevalence of brainstorming sessions. \nOne particular session brainstormed for a pitch for a large contract for a soft drink and was \noriented towards capturing the intangible in two keys ways. Firstly, the session aimed to \ndevelop understandings of the product\u2019s \u2018brand personality\u2019 (\u2018radical\u2019, \u2018extreme\u2019, \n\u2018challenging\u2019, \u2018fun\u2019) by throwing around key words and associations and drawing on \nadvertising folk knowledges, their own experiences, and previous advertising campaigns for \nthe product. The lack of detail or data they received in the brief from the company did not \nrestrict these calculations. Secondly, it attempted to establish competitive advantage by \nconcluding that the product\u2019s brand personality did not tally with the target market for the \nproduct and by tying their particular portfolio of advertising sites to a potential campaign (e.g. \nspecial campaigns in parks). These calculations were framed by the standard industry practice \nof competitively pitching for contracts. In effect, the dynamism of the market relationships \nbetween media owners, media agencies and clients is performative. It animates the search for, \nand circulation of, forms of knowledges \u2013 vital knowledges \u2013 which in turn animate the field \nand in their performative action enact commercial futures. \nOf course, on a mundane level companies are strategic about the futures they release. I \nobserved how in commissioning research from research companies - for instance, on a \nparticular poster campaign\u2019s impact on viewers - media owners were very careful about \nproducing the frame of reference or the terms of the questionnaire used. As one media owner \nnoted, they know the answers they want to get and are very circumspect about the design of \n 17\nthe study as any negative responses have to be declared. But in more general terms, \ncompanies are very open to more diffuse commercial experiments as they are seen as a highly \nproductive means of inhabiting the moment and performing futures. On one level, this \ninvolves predicting trends in the commercial field, for example, up or downturns in clients\u2019 \noverall advertising spend, or potential changes to planning laws which may impact upon \ncompanies\u2019 ability to secure new sites for advertising panels. But more radically, through a \nflexible approach to producing and processing commercial knowledges, the industry attempts \nto capture the creative energy that it considers is produced in the collective performance of its \nown commercial relationships. The spokesperson of the Institute for Practitioners in \nAdvertising, a key trade association, describes the tension in the industry between the impulse \nto measure and classify, and the more diffuse benefits of maintaining an open stance to the \nunknown: \n \nThere\u2019s a tremendous desire to measure everything and for everything to be accountable \nbecause it\u2019s only by knowing something that you can accurately develop it - [that] \nwould be the argument. The problem is that the more you record, the more you are \nbeholden to what you record and it\u2019s almost always [a] proxy of reality [as] it\u2019s very, \nvery difficult to really, truly model the world we live in\u2026 I mean, it\u2019s fantastically \ncomplex so attempting to extract a handful of strands and then saying that, \u2018there you \ngo, that\u2019s why that happened\u2019 is incredibly difficult\u2026 And if all your decisions are \nbased on what you can measure, there is still a world that you can\u2019t measure that has \npotential value and if you approach it cleverly\u2026 you can derive far more benefit from it \nthan you could have imagined just because you have difficulty with measuring it. \n \nThis encapsulates the perception that I observed many times \u2013 that formal quantitative \ncalculation and measurement can be unduly restrictive. On one level, this corresponds to \nCallon and Muniesa\u2019s (2005) observation that there is no longer a strict division in calculative \npractices between (qualitative) judgement and quantitative (or numeric) calculation. But the \npractices I observed suggest something more \u2013 an awareness among practitioners that the \nreferentiality of their classifications and calculation to \u2018the real world\u2019 is mutable and flexible, \nand that the commercial energy or vitalism which is performed in these market practices and \nrelationships can be tapped for their benefit.  \nMassey argues that space is \u2018a simultaneity of stories-so-far\u2019 (2005: 9), but times and \nspaces are here folded together with an eye to the future and we also need to understand the \n 18\nproduct of this folding as a temporal and spatial simultaneity of stories-to-come. Some of \nthese stories are: the openness of people\u2019s engagement or disengagement with advertising or \nwith the visual field of cities in general; new ways of competitively inhabiting positions in the \nnexus of commercial relationships such as offering new services to clients that dispense with \nthe need for media agencies as intermediaries; shifting trends such as \u2018green\u2019 consumption; \nand new questions whose very form has yet to be imagined. One unforeseen consequence of \nthe intensification of the circulation of marketing data in the industry\u2019s practices is the \nproduction of the city as calculative space. \n \n \nCalculative spaces  \n \nDrawing on Lefebvre\u2019s (1991) conceptualisation of energy\u2013time\u2013space, I have argued that the \noutdoor advertising industry understands the performance of its market relationships as \ngenerating a kind of commercial vitalism which can be tapped for the industry\u2019s benefit. This \nunderstanding, and the ways in which the industry acts upon it, animates the specific market \nrelations of the field and is in turn animated by them. Within the nexus of energy, time and \nspace, the recursive performance of marketing knowledges and practices effect a temporary \nholding together of urban space and people in that space. The loose coupling of advertising \nand effects on sales, in parallel with flexibly referential understandings of space and people, \norients the advertising industry and allows the play of creative insight. Space and market \nrelations are, in effect, in a performative relationship. Clearly, this is not an abstract, Cartesian \nmapping of space: the industry understands people and space as articulated in a self-\nconstitutive relationship which is dynamic, unpredictable and overlaid with multiple realities. \nThis is a practical, commercial understanding which has parallels with recent academic \nunderstandings of urban space as \u2018an enormous confluence of relationships without fixed \nsites\u2019 (Amin and Thrift, 2002: 123). In effect, the classificatory and mapping practices of the \nindustry, together with the performance of its commercial relationships, produce calculative \nspaces. \nMost accounts of calculation and space frame their analysis in terms of governance: in \norder to render them manageable, spaces are crafted by various representational strategies to \nbe calculable, thus delivering them up to technologies of governance (e.g. Miller, 1994; \nOsborne and Rose, 1999). In parallel, some accounts suggest that such technologies produce \ncalculative subjects (Rose, 1999). In my study, practitioners were clearly reflexive agents who \n 19\npractise various forms of calculation and measurement, but their status as calculative subjects \nis rather dimmed by a fact I continually encountered \u2013 almost none of the practitioners fully \nunderstood how the databases, metrics or research systems worked, thus restricting their \nmanipulation of them (although they could produce a limited range of outputs through various \nconventions of use). This level of ignorance was voiced by the spokesperson of the IPA who \nsaid of econometrics, \u2018it\u2019s a bit of a dark art and it\u2019s something I have only a vague \nunderstanding of\u2019. \nThus, the calculative dynamics clearly present in the industry do not originate only \nfrom the practitioners. As Callon and Muniesa (2005) have argued, economic calculation is \ndistributed among human actors and material devices. Here, this includes various marketing \ndatabases (standard marketing sources such as TGI as well as more general sources such as \nthat of the Office for National Statistics), and paper-based distributions (client briefs, flipchart \nnotes from brainstorming sessions, creative pitches). But market relationships between media \nowners, media agencies, research companies and clients also constitute a calculative nexus. \nAs I have outlined, the practice and circulation associated with research data performs market \nrelationships and here produces them as a calculative formation \u2013 calculation of market \nposition, financial gain and potential consumers is central to this formation. But more than \nthis, an orientation toward calculation and facilitation of calculative functions becomes \nfundamentally embedded in these market relations through the recursive nature of such \nperformances.  \nThe confluence of multiple commercial factors creates a new support surface for \nmarket relations \u2013 a calculative space. It is clear that the outdoor advertising industry has a \nrange of appreciable effects on urban space. Advertising on panels, billboards, buses and taxis \netc all directly impact on the making of spaces, not merely by adding their semantic content to \nthe rich textual mix of city space, but in helping shape the affective geographies of urban \nspace, introducing new visual technologies into public space (moving image billboards, \ninteractive bus shelters etc), constantly reiterating the commercial nature of supposedly public \nurban space in a hyper-visible way, and financing urban infrastructures such as the London \nUnderground through the large contract fee required from the media owner of tube advertising \nsites. \nBut alongside these more immediately evident features is the production of the city as \ncalculative space. As space is a product of social relations, these practices or commercial \nexperiments go towards forming the nature and potential of that space. The calculative nature \nof such space is performed through a recursive, shifting relationship between the various \n 20\nelements I have outlined above: the use of intuition or gut feeling in producing creative \ninsight; the strategic deployment of various market research techniques and technologies; the \nproduction and reformation of various data through the circulation of PowerPoint \npresentations; the loose coupling of commercial cause and effect allowing flexible new modes \nof understanding data and commercial relationships; and a \u2018light touch\u2019 with regard to data in \norder to preserve an orientation to the future that unleashes its unforeseen potential. These \nfactors are combined with a core understanding of space as a pliable resource and of its fluid \nrelationship with people, and these understandings are folded inextricably into the production \nof specific market relationships. \nThis produces a calculative space which is an admixture of space, people, calculation \ntechniques, calculation technologies, and an orientation towards the potential of creative \ninsight. For the industry, it makes no sense to try to separate these elements: they constitute a \nset of experiments that produces a commercial reality which can be channelled for profit. One \nresult is that a calculative quality, characteristic or orientation comes to be interwoven into the \ncreative process of producing the city as a fluid, flexible entity. It is an understanding of space \nas \u2018folded and animate\u2019; one result of a shift to a world of \u2018qualculation\u2019 characterised by \ncontinual calculation facilitated by machines which constitutes a means of \u2018making qualitative \njudgments and working with ambiguity\u2019 (Thrift, 2004: 584). This should be understood as \nprocess and radical relationality: forces of commercial calculation, times, and spaces are \ncontinually disaggregated and reconstituted. \nWe can only begin to speculate on the impact of this. The recursive incorporation of \nthe industry\u2019s understanding of its performances as a form of commercial vitalism may \nanimate the city in new ways. As the city comes alive through commercial experiments, this \nprocess may afford alternative ways of knowing that exceed the conventional modes of \nreading the city through meanings, messages, signs and symbols. It is less that the city is \nspeaking in a new language of calculation and commercial vitalism than processing new \nunderstandings of itself. The calculative energy of such spaces allows for commercial \ninnovations in market performances such as alternative understanding generated by possible \nconnections between standard marketing metrics and creative insight. Indeed, if government \nis \u2018animated by a spatial diagram of its objects, its problems and its means of action\u2019 as \nOsborne and Rose (1999: 738) suggest, calculative spaces will engender shifting modes of \ngovernance or perhaps fresh ways of imagining governance. But this produces not a \nhomogenised city space subjected to and governed by commercial knowledge-producing \n 21\nactivities, but multiple, co-existing time-spaces of the urban which are animated by a \ncalculative energy. \n \n \nAcknowledgments \n \nI would like to thank the following for their useful comments on drafts of this paper: Monica \nDegen, B\u00fclent Diken, Anne-Marie Fortier, Adrian Mackenzie, Celia Roberts, Andrew Sayer, \nJohn Urry and anonymous reviewers. \n \nReferences \nAlvesson M, 1994, \u201cTalking in organizations: managing identity and impressions \nin an advertising agency\u201d Organization Studies 15(4) 535\u2013563 \n \nAmin A, Thrift N, 2002 Cities: Reimagining the Urban (Polity Press, Cambridge) \n \nBauman Z, 2000 Liquid Modernity (Polity Press, Cambridge) \n \nBeck U, Bonss W, Lau C, 2003, \u201cThe theory of reflexive modernization: problematic, \nhypotheses and research programme\u201d Theory, Culture and Society 20(2) 1-33 \n \nBowker G C, Star S L, 1999 Sorting Things Out: Classification and its Consequences (MIT \nPress,  London and Cambridge, MA) \n \nBullmore J, 1991 Behind the Scenes in Advertising (NTC Publications Ltd, Henley-on-\nThames) \n \nBurrows R, Gane, N, 2006, \u201cGeodemographics, software and class\u201d Sociology 40(5) 793-812 \n \nCallon M, Ed, 1998 The Laws of the Markets (Blackwell, Oxford) \n \nCallon M, M\u00e9adel C, Rabeharisoa V, 2002, \u201cThe economy of qualities\u201d Economy and Society \n31(2) 194-217  \n \nCallon M, Muniesa, F, 2005, \u201cEconomic markets as calculative devices\u201d Organization \nStudies 26(8) 1229-1250 \n \nCarrier J, Miller, D, (Eds), 1998 Virtualism: A New Political Economy (Berg, Oxford)  \n \nCastells M, 2000 The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture, Volume 1: The Rise of \nthe Network Society (Blackwell, Oxford and Malden, MA)  \n \n 22\nCochoy F, 1998, \u201cAnother discipline for the market economy: marketing as a performative \nknowledge and know-how for capitalism\u201d, in The Laws of the Markets Ed.
