INTRODUCTION\nThermodynamics is among the most successfully\nand extensively applied theoretical concepts in physics.\nNotwithstanding, the various limits of its applicability\nare not fully understood [1, 2].\nOf particular interest is its microscopic limit. Down to\nwhich length scales can its standard concepts meaning-\nfully be defined and employed?\nBesides its general importance, this question has\nbecome increasingly relevant recently since amazing\nprogress in the synthesis and processing of materials with\nstructures on nanometer length scales has created a de-\nmand for better understanding of thermal properties of\nnanoscale devices, individual nanostructures and nanos-\ntructured materials [3, 4, 5, 6]. Experimental techniques\nhave improved to such an extent that the measurement of\nthermodynamic quantities like temperature with a spa-\ntial resolution on the nanometer scale seems within reach\n[7, 8, 9].\nTo provide a basis for the interpretation of present day\nand future experiments in nanoscale physics and tech-\nnology and to obtain a better understanding of the lim-\nits of thermodynamics, it is thus indispensable to clarify\nthe applicability of thermodynamical concepts on small\nlength scales starting from the most fundamental theory\nat hand, i. e. quantum mechanics. In this context, one\nquestion appears to be particularly important and in-\nteresting: Can temperature be meaningfully defined on\nnanometer length scales?\nThe existence of thermodynamical quantities, i. e. the\n\u2217Electronic address: michael.hartmann@dlr.de\nexistence of the thermodynamic limit strongly depends\non the correlations between the considered parts of a sys-\ntem.\nWith increasing size, the volume of a region in space\ngrows faster than its surface. Thus effective interactions\nbetween two regions, provided they are short ranged, be-\ncome less relevant as the sizes of the regions increase.\nThis scaling behavior is used to show that correlations\nbetween a region and its environment become negligible\nin the limit of infinite region size and that therefore the\nthermodynamic limit exists [10, 11, 12].\nTo explore the minimal region size needed for the appli-\ncation of thermodynamical concepts, situations far away\nfrom the thermodynamic limit should be analyzed. On\nthe other hand, effective correlations between the consid-\nered parts need to be small enough [17, 18].\nThe scaling of interactions between parts of a system\ncompared to the energy contained in the parts themselves\nthus sets a minimal length scale on which correlations\nare still small enough to permit the definition of local\ntemperatures. It is the aim of this paper to study this\nconnection quantitatively\nSome attempts to generalize thermodynamics such\nthat it applies to small systems have been made [13, 14,\n15]. These approaches consider ensembles of indepen-\ndent, i.e. noninteracting, small systems. By introducing\nan additional thermodynamical potential they take into\naccount the surface effects of the small systems. However,\nsince the interactions between the small systems are ne-\nglected, these concepts cannot capture the physics of the\ncorrelations. This shortcoming is also obvious from the\nresults: The correction terms they predict do not depend\non temperature, whereas it is well known, that correla-\ntions become more important the lower the temperature.\nRecently the impact of quantum correlations, i. e. en-\n2tanglement on macroscopic properties of solids and phase\ntransitions has drawn considerable attention [19, 20, 21].\nSince our analysis of criteria for local temperatures is\nbased on a study of correlations, our theoretical approach\nis a promising tool to provide further insight into the role\nof correlations in solid state physics.\nWe adopt here the convention that a local tempera-\nture exists if the considered part of the system is in a\ncanonical state, where the distribution is an exponen-\ntially decaying function of energy characterized by one\nsingle parameter. This implies that there is a one-to-\none mapping between temperature and the expectation\nvalues of observables, by which temperature is usually\nmeasured. Temperature measurements based on differ-\nent observables will thus yield the same result, contrary\nto distributions with several parameters. In large sys-\ntems composed of very many subsystems, the density of\nstates is a strongly growing function of energy [22]. If the\ndistribution were not exponentially decaying, the prod-\nuct of the density of states times the distribution would\nnot have a pronounced peak and thus physical quantities\nlike energy would not have \u201csharp\u201d values.\nThere have been atempts to describe systems which\nare not in an equilibrium state but in some sense close\nto it with a generalized form of thermodynamics, that\nhas additional system parameters. Such a situation ap-\npears for example in glasses [16]. Our approach analyzes\nwhether thermodynamics in its standard form can apply\nlocally. A study whether a generalized form of thermody-\nnamics might apply even more locally should be a subject\nof future research.\nA typical setup where the minimal length scale we cal-\nculate becomes relevant could be the measurement of a\ntemperature profile with very high resolution etc. One\nis thus interested in scenarios where the entire sample is\nexpected to be in a stationary state. In most cases this\nstate is close to a thermal equilibrium state [23].\nBased on the above arguments and noting that a quan-\ntum description becomes imperative at nanoscopic scales,\nthe following approach appears to be reasonable: Con-\nsider a large homogeneous quantum system, brought into\na thermal state via interaction with its environment, di-\nvide this system into subgroups and analyze for what\nsubgroup-size the concept of temperature is still applica-\nble.\nHarmonic lattice models are a standard tool for the\ndescription of thermal properties of solids. We therefore\napply our theory to a harmonic chain model to get esti-\nmates that are expected to be relevant for real materials\nand might be tested by experiments.\nRecently, spin chains have been subject of extensive\nstudies in condensed matter physics and quantum in-\nformation theory. Thus correlations and possible local\ntemperatures in spin chains are of interest, both from a\ntheoretical and experimental point of view [24, 25]. We\nstudy spin chains with respect to our present purpose and\ncompare their characteristics with the harmonic chain.\nThis paper is organized as follows: In section II, we\npresent the general theoretical approach which derives\ntwo conditions on the effective group interactions and\nthe global temperature. In the following two sections we\napply the general consideration to two concrete models\nand derive estimates for the minimal subgroup size. Sec-\ntion III deals with a harmonic chain, a model with an\ninfinite energy spectrum. In contrast, a spin chain has a\nbounded energy spectrum. Section IV therefore discusses\nan Ising spin chain in a transverse field. In the conclu-\nsions section V, we compare the results for the different\nmodels considered and indicate further interesting topics.\nII. GENERAL THEORY\nWe consider a homogeneous (i.e. translation invariant)\nchain of elementary quantum subsystems with nearest\nneighbor interactions. The Hamiltonian of our system is\nthus of the form [26],\nH =\n\u2211\ni\nHi + Ii,i+1 (1)\nwhere the index i labels the elementary subsystems. Hi\nis the Hamiltonian of subsystem i and Ii,i+1 the interac-\ntion between subsystem i and i+1. We assume periodic\nboundary conditions.\nWe now form NG groups of n subsystems each (index\ni\u2192 (\u00b5\u2212 1)n+ j; \u00b5 = 1, . . . , NG; j = 1, . . . , n) and split\nthis Hamiltonian into two parts,\nH = H0 + I, (2)\nwhere H0 is the sum of the Hamiltonians of the isolated\ngroups,\nH0 =\nNG\u2211\n\u00b5=1\n(H\u00b5 \u2212 I\u00b5n,\u00b5n+1) with\nH\u00b5 =\nn\u2211\nj=1\nHn(\u00b5\u22121)+j + In(\u00b5\u22121)+j, n(\u00b5\u22121)+j+1 (3)\nand I contains the interaction terms of each group with\nits neighbor group,\nI =\nNG\u2211\n\u00b5=1\nI\u00b5n,\u00b5n+1. (4)\nWe label the eigenstates of the total Hamiltonian H and\ntheir energies with the Greek indices (\u03d5, \u03c8) and eigen-\nstates and energies of the group Hamiltonian H0 with\nLatin indices (a, b),\nH |\u03d5\u3009 = E\u03d5 |\u03d5\u3009 and H0 |a\u3009 = Ea |a\u3009. (5)\nHere, the states |a\u3009 are products of group eigenstates\n|a\u3009 =\nNG\u220f\n\u00b5=1\n|a\u00b5\u3009, (6)\nwhere (H\u00b5 \u2212 I\u00b5n,\u00b5n+1) |a\u00b5\u3009 = E\u00b5|a\u00b5\u3009. E\u00b5 is the energy\nof one subgroup only and Ea =\n\u2211NG\n\u00b5=1 E\u00b5.\n3A. Thermal State in the Product Basis\nWe assume that the total system is in a thermal state\nwith the density matrix\n\u3008\u03d5|\u03c1\u02c6|\u03c8\u3009 = e\n\u2212\u03b2E\u03d5\nZ\n\u03b4\u03d5\u03c8 (7)\nin the eigenbasis of H . Here, Z is the partition sum and\n\u03b2 = (kBT )\n\u22121 the inverse temperature with Boltzmann\u2019s\nconstant kB and temperature T . Transforming the den-\nsity matrix (7) into the eigenbasis of H0 we obtain\n\u3008a|\u03c1\u02c6|a\u3009 =\n\u222b E1\nE0\nwa(E)\ne\u2212\u03b2E\nZ\ndE (8)\nfor the diagonal elements in the new basis. Here, the\nsum over all states |\u03d5\u3009 has been replaced by an integral\nover the energy. E0 is the energy of the ground state\nand E1 the upper limit of the spectrum. For systems\nwith an energy spectrum that does not have an upper\nbound, the limit E1 \u2192 \u221e should be taken. The density\nof conditional probabilities wa(E) is given by\nwa(E) =\n1\n\u2206E\n\u2211\n{|\u03d5\u3009:E\u2264E\u03d5<E+\u2206E}\n|\u3008a|\u03d5\u3009|2 (9)\nwhere \u2206E is small and the sum runs over all states |\u03d5\u3009\nwith eigenvalues E\u03d5 in the interval [E,E + \u2206E). To\ncompute the integral of equation (8) we need to know\nthe distribution of the conditional probabilities wa(E).\nThe state |a\u3009 is not an eigenstate of the total Hamilto-\nnian H . Thus, if H would be measured in the state |a\u3009,\neigenvalues of H would be obtained with certain proba-\nbilities: wa(E) is the density of this probability distribu-\ntion. Since the hamiltonian H is the sum of hamiltonians\nof the groups, the situation has some analogies to a sum\nof random variables. This indicates that there might ex-\nist a central limit theorem for the present quantum sys-\ntem, provided the number of groups becomes very large\n[28] . Since the state |a\u3009 is not translation invariant and\nsince H also contains the group interactions, the central\nlimit theorem has to be of a Lyapunov (or Lindeberg)\ntype for mixing sequences [27]. One can indeed show\nthat such a quantum central limit theorem exists for the\npresent model [29, 31] and that wa(E) thus converges\nto a Gaussian normal distribution in the limit of infinite\nnumber of groups NG,\nlim\nNG\u2192\u221e\nwa(E) =\n1\u221a\n2pi\u2206a\nexp\n(\n\u2212 (E \u2212 Ea \u2212 \u03b5a)\n2\n2\u22062a\n)\n,\n(10)\nwhere the quantities \u03b5a and \u2206a are defined by\n\u03b5a \u2261 \u3008a|H |a\u3009 \u2212 Ea (11)\n\u22062a \u2261 \u3008a|H2|a\u3009 \u2212 \u3008a|H |a\u30092. (12)\n\u03b5a is the difference between the energy expectation value\nof the distribution wa(E) and the energy Ea, while \u2206\n2\na is\nthe variance of the energy E for the distribution wa(E).\nNote that \u03b5a has a classical counterpart while \u2206\n2\na is\npurely quantum mechanical. It appears because the com-\nmutator [H,H0] is nonzero, and the distribution wa(E)\ntherefore has nonzero width. The two quantities \u03b5a and\n\u22062a can also be expressed in terms of the interaction only\n(see eq. (2)),\n\u03b5a = \u3008a|I|a\u3009 (13)\n\u22062a = \u3008a|I2|a\u3009 \u2212 \u3008a|I|a\u30092, (14)\nmeaning that \u03b5a is the expectation value and \u2206\n2\na the\nsquared width of the interactions in the state |a\u3009.\nThe rigorous proof of equation (10) is given in [29] and\nbased on the following two assumptions: The energy of\neach group H\u00b5 as defined in equation (3) is bounded, i.\ne.\n\u3008\u03c7|H\u00b5|\u03c7\u3009 \u2264 C (15)\nfor all normalized states |\u03c7\u3009 and some constant C, and\n\u3008a|H2|a\u3009 \u2212 \u3008a|H |a\u30092 \u2265 NGC\u2032 (16)\nfor some constant C\u2032 > 0.\nIn scenarios where the energy spectrum of each ele-\nmentary subsystem has an upper limit, such as spins,\ncondition (15) is met a priori. For subsystems with an\ninfinite energy spectrum, such as harmonic oscillators,\nwe restrict our analysis to states where the energy of ev-\nery group, including the interactions with its neighbors,\nis bounded. Thus, our considerations do not apply to\nproduct states |a\u3009, for which all the energy was located\nin only one group or only a small number of groups. Since\nNG \u226b 1, the number of such states is vanishingly small\ncompared to the number of all product states.\nIf conditions (15) and (16) are met, equation (8) can\nbe computed for NG \u226b 1 [30]:\n\u3008a|\u03c1\u02c6|a\u3009 = 1\n2Z\nexp\n(\n\u2212\u03b2ya + \u03b2\n2\u22062a\n2\n)\n[\nerfc\n(\nE0 \u2212 ya + \u03b2\u22062a\u221a\n2\u2206a\n)\n\u2212 erfc\n(\nE1 \u2212 ya + \u03b2\u22062a\u221a\n2\u2206a\n)]\n(17)\nwhere ya = Ea+\u03b5a and erfc(x) is the conjugate Gaussian\nerror function,\nerfc(x) =\n2\u221a\npi\n\u222b \u221e\nx\ne\u2212s\n2\nds. (18)\nThe second error function in (17) only appears if the\nenergy is bounded and the integration extends from the\nenergy of the ground state E0 to the upper limit of the\nspectrum E1.\nNote that ya is a sum of NG terms and that \u2206a ful-\nfills equation (16). The arguments of the conjugate error\nfunctions thus grow proportional to\n\u221a\nNG or stronger.\nIf these arguments divided by\n\u221a\nNG are finite (different\n4from zero), the asymptotic expansion of the error func-\ntion [32] may thus be used for NG \u226b 1:\nerfc(x) \u2248\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f3\nexp\n(\u2212x2)\u221a\npi x\nfor x\u2192\u221e\n2 +\nexp\n(\u2212x2)\u221a\npi x\nfor x\u2192 \u2212\u221e\n(19)\nInserting this approximation into equation (17) and using\nE0 < ya < E1 shows that the second conjugate error\nfunction, which contains the upper limit of the energy\nspectrum, can always be neglected compared to the first,\nwhich contains the ground state energy.\nThe same type of arguments show that the normaliza-\ntions of the Gaussian in equation (10) is correct although\nthe energy range does not extend over the entire real axis\n(\u2212\u221e,\u221e).\nApplying the asymptotic expansion (19), equation (17)\ncan be taken to read\n\u3008a|\u03c1\u02c6|a\u3009 = 1\nZ\nexp\n[\n\u2212\u03b2\n(\nEa + \u03b5a \u2212 \u03b2\u2206\n2\na\n2\n)]\n(20)\nfor\n(\nE0 \u2212 Ea \u2212 \u03b5a + \u03b2\u22062a\n)\n\/\n(\u221a\n2NG\u2206a\n)\n< 0 and\n\u3008a|\u03c1\u02c6|a\u3009 =\nexp\n(\n\u2212\u03b2E0 \u2212 (Ea + \u03b5a \u2212 E0)\n2\n2\u22062a\n)\n\u221a\n2pi Z\nE0 \u2212 Ea \u2212 \u03b5a + \u03b2\u22062a\n\u2206a\n, (21)\nfor\n(\nE0 \u2212 Ea \u2212 \u03b5a + \u03b2\u22062a\n)\n\/\n(\u221a\n2NG\u2206a\n)\n> 0.\nThe off diagonal elements \u3008a|\u03c1\u02c6|b\u3009 vanish for\n|Ea\u2212Eb| > \u2206a+\u2206b because the overlap of the two distri-\nbutions of conditional probabilities becomes negligible.\nFor |Ea \u2212 Eb| < \u2206a + \u2206b, the transformation involves\nan integral over frequencies and thus these terms are\nsignificantly smaller than the entries on the diagonal.\nB. Conditions for Local Thermal States\nWe now test under what conditions the density matrix\n\u03c1\u02c6 may be approximated by a product of canonical den-\nsity matrices with temperature \u03b2loc for each subgroup\n\u00b5 = 1, 2, . . . , NG. Since the trace of a matrix is invariant\nunder basis transformations, it is sufficient to verify the\ncorrect energy dependence of the product density matrix.\nIf we assume periodic boundary conditions, all reduced\ndensity matrices are equal and their product is of the\nform \u3008a|\u03c1\u02c6|a\u3009 \u221d exp(\u2212\u03b2locEa). We thus have to verify\nwhether the logarithm of rhs of equations (20) and (21)\nis a linear function of the energy Ea,\nln (\u3008a|\u03c1\u02c6|a\u3009) \u2248 \u2212\u03b2locEa + c, (22)\nwhere \u03b2loc and c are constants.\nNote that equation (22) does not imply that the occu-\npation probability of an eigenstate |\u03d5\u3009 with energy E\u03d5\nand a product state with the same energy Ea \u2248 E\u03d5\nare equal. Since \u03b2loc and \u03b2 enter into the exponents\nof the respective canonical distributions, the difference\nbetween both has significant consequences for the occu-\npation probabilities; even if \u03b2loc and \u03b2 are equal with\nvery high accuracy, but not exactly the same, occupation\nprobabilities may differ by several orders of magnitude,\nprovided that the energy range is large enough.\nWe exclude negative temperatures (\u03b2 > 0). Equation\n(22) can only be true for\nEa + \u03b5a \u2212 E0\u221a\nNG\u2206a\n> \u03b2\n\u22062a\u221a\nNG\u2206a\n, (23)\nas can be seen from equations (20) and (21). In this\ncase, \u3008a|\u03c1\u02c6|a\u3009 is given by (20) and to satisfy (22), \u03b5a and\n\u22062a furthermore have to be of the following form:\n\u2212\u03b5a + \u03b2\n2\n\u22062a \u2248 c1Ea + c2 (24)\nwhere c1 and c2 are constants. Note that \u03b5a and \u2206\n2\na need\nnot be functions of Ea and therefore in general cannot be\nexpanded in a Taylor series.\nTo ensure that the density matrix of each subgroup \u00b5\nis approximately canonical, one needs to satisfy (24) for\neach subgroup \u00b5 separately;\n\u2212\u03b5\u00b5\u22121 + \u03b5\u00b5\n2\n+\n\u03b2\n4\n(\n\u22062\u00b5\u22121 +\u2206\n2\n\u00b5\n)\n+\n\u03b2\n6\n\u2206\u02dc2\u00b5 \u2248 c1E\u00b5 + c2\n(25)\nwhere \u03b5\u00b5 = \u3008a|I\u00b5n,\u00b5n+1|a\u3009 with \u03b5a =\n\u2211NG\n\u00b5=1 \u03b5\u00b5,\n\u22062\u00b5 = \u3008a|H2\u00b5|a\u3009 \u2212 \u3008a|H\u00b5|a\u30092 and \u2206\u02dc2\u00b5 =\u2211\u00b5+1\n\u03bd=\u00b5\u22121\u3008a|H\u03bd\u22121H\u03bd +H\u03bdH\u03bd\u22121|a\u3009\u22122\u3008a|H\u03bd\u22121|a\u3009\u3008a|H\u03bd |a\u3009\nand\nTemperature becomes intensive, if the constant c1 van-\nishes,\n|c1| \u226a 1 \u21d2 \u03b2loc = \u03b2. (26)\nIf this was not the case, temperature would not be inten-\nsive, although it might exist locally.\nIt is sufficient to satisfy conditions (23) and (25) for\nan adequate energy range Emin \u2264 E\u00b5 \u2264 Emax only. For\nlarge systems with a modular structure, i.e. a system\ncomposed of a large number of subsystems, the density\nof states is typically a rapidly growing function of energy\n[22, 33]. If the total system is in a thermal state, occupa-\ntion probabilities decay exponentially with energy. The\nproduct of these two functions is thus sharply peaked at\nthe expectation value of the energy E of the total system\nE+E0 =Tr(H\u03c1\u02c6), with E0 being the ground state energy\n(see figure 1). The energy range thus needs to be cen-\ntered around this peak and large enough. On the other\nhand it must not be larger than the range of values E\u00b5\ncan take on. Therefore a pertinent and \u201csafe\u201d choice for\nEmin and Emax is\nEmin = max\n(\n[E\u00b5]min ,\n1\n\u03b1\nE\nNG\n+ E0NG\n)\nEmax = min\n(\n[E\u00b5]max , \u03b1\nE\nNG\n+ E0NG\n) (27)\n5replacements\n\u03b7(E)\n\u3008\u03d5|\u03c1\u02c6|\u03d5\u3009\n\u03b7(E) \u00b7 \u3008\u03d5|\u03c1\u02c6|\u03d5\u3009\nEmin Emax\nE\nE\nFIG. 1: The product of the density of states \u03b7(E) times the\noccupation probabilities \u3008\u03d5|\u03c1\u02c6|\u03d5\u3009 forms a strongly pronounced\npeak at E = E.\nwhere \u03b1\u226b 1 and E will in general depend on the global\ntemperature.

The actual density\nmatrix is more mixed than the canonical one. In the\ninterval between the two vertical lines, both criteria (23)\nand (25) are satisfied. For E < Elow (23) is violated and\n(25) for E > Ehigh. To allow for a description by means\nof canonical density matrices, the group size needs to be\nchosen such that Elow < Emin and Ehigh > Emax.\nElow Ehigh\nln (\u3008a|\u03c1\u02c6|a\u3009)\nE\nFIG. 2: ln (\u3008a|\u03c1\u02c6|a\u3009) for \u03c1\u02c6 as in equation (17) (solid line) and a\ncanonical density matrix \u03c1\u02c6 (dashed line) for a harmonic chain.\nFor a model obeying equations (15) and (16), the two\nconditions (23) and (25), which constitute the general\nresult of this article, must both be satisfied. These fun-\ndamental criteria will now be applied to some concrete\nexamples.\nIII. HARMONIC CHAIN\nAs a representative for the class of systems with an\ninfinite energy spectrum, we consider a harmonic chain\nof NG \u00b7n particles of mass m and spring constant\n\u221a\nm\u03c90.\nIn this case, the Hamiltonian reads\nHi =\nm\n2\np2i +\nm\n2\n\u03c920 q\n2\ni (28)\nIi,i+1 = \u2212m\u03c920 qi qi+1, (29)\nwhere pi is the momentum of the particle at site i and\nqi the displacement from its equilibrium position i \u00b7 a0\nwith a0 being the distance between neighboring parti-\ncles at equilibrium. We divide the chain into NG groups\nof n particles each and thus get a partition of the type\nconsidered above.\nThe Hamiltonian of one group is diagonalized by a\nFourier transform and the definition of creation and an-\nnihilation operators a\u2020k and ak for the Fourier modes (see\nappendix A).\nEa =\nNG\u2211\n\u00b5=1\n\u2211\nk\n\u03c9k\n(\nnak(\u00b5) +\n1\n2\n)\n, (30)\nwhere k = pil\/(a0 (n + 1)) (l = 1, 2, . . . , n) and the fre-\nquencies \u03c9k are given by \u03c9\n2\nk = 4\u03c9\n2\n0 sin\n2(ka\/2). nak(\u00b5) is\nthe occupation number of mode k of group \u00b5 in the state\n|a\u3009. We chose units, where ~ = 1.\nWe first verify that the harmonic chain model fulfills\nthe conditions for the applicability of the quantum cen-\ntral limit theorem (10). To see that it satisfies the con-\ndition (16) one needs to express the group interaction\nI\u00b5n,\u00b5n+1 in terms of a\n\u2020\nk and ak, which yields \u2206\u02dc\u00b5 = 0 for\nall \u00b5 and therefore\n\u22062a =\nNG\u2211\n\u00b5=1\n\u22062\u00b5, (31)\nwhere \u2206\u00b5, the width of one group interaction, reads\n\u22062\u00b5 =\n(\n2\nn+ 1\n)2(\u2211\nk\ncos2\n(\nka0\n2\n)\n\u03c9k\n(\nnk +\n1\n2\n))\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\n(\u2211\np\ncos2\n(pa0\n2\n)\n\u03c9p\n(\nmp +\n1\n2\n))\n.\n(32)\n\u22062\u00b5 has a minimum value since all nk \u2265 0 and allmp \u2265 0.\nIn equation (32), k labels the modes of group \u00b5 with\noccupation numbers nk and p the modes of group \u00b5 + 1\nwith occupation numbers mp. The width \u2206\n2\na thus fulfills\ncondition (16).\nSince the spectrum of every single oscillator is infinite,\ncondition (15) can only be satisfied for states, for which\nthe energy of the system is distributed among a substan-\ntial fraction of the groups, as discussed in section II.\nWe now turn to analyze the two criteria (23) and (25).\nThe expectation values of the group interactions vanish,\n\u03b5\u00b5 = 0, while the widths \u2206\n2\n\u00b5 depend on the occupation\nnumbers nk and therefore on the energies E\u00b5. We thus\nhave to consider both conditions, (23) and (25). To an-\nalyze these, we make use of the continuum or Debye\n6approximation [34], requiring n \u226b 1, a0 \u226a l, where\nl = n a0, and the length of the chain to be finite. In\nthis case we have \u03c9k = v k with the constant velocity of\nsound v = \u03c90 a0 and cos(k a0\/2) \u2248 1. The width of the\ngroup interaction thus translates into\n\u22062\u00b5 =\n4\nn2\nE\u00b5 E\u00b5+1 (33)\nwhere n + 1 \u2248 n has been used. The relevant energy\nscale is introduced by the thermal expectation value of\nthe entire chain\nE = NGnkB\u0398\n(\nT\n\u0398\n)2 \u222b \u0398\/T\n0\nx\nex \u2212 1 dx, (34)\nand the ground state energy is given by\nE0 = NGnkB\u0398\n(\nT\n\u0398\n)2 \u222b \u0398\/T\n0\nx\n2\ndx =\nNGnkB\u0398\n4\n(35)\nWe first consider the criterion (23).\nFor a given Ea =\n\u2211\n\u00b5E\u00b5, the squared width \u2206\n2\n\u00b5 is\nlargest if all E\u00b5 are equal, E\u00b5 = E\u02dc \u2200\u00b5. Thus (23) is\nhardest to satisfy for that case, where it reduces to\nE\u02dc \u2212 E0\nNG\n\u2212 4\u03b2\nn2\nE\u02dc2 > 0. (36)\nEquation (36) sets a lower bound on n. For temperatures\nwhere E < E0, this bound is strongest for low energies\nE\u02dc, while at E > E0 it is strongest for high energies E\u02dc.\nSince condition (25) is a stronger criterion than condition\n(23) for E > E0, we only consider (36) at temperatures\nwhere E < E0. In this range, (36) is hardest to satisfy\nfor low energies, i.e. at E\u02dc = (E\/\u03b1NG)+ (E0\/NG), where\nit reduces to\nn >\n\u0398\nT\n\u03b1\n4e\n(\n4e\n\u03b1\n+ 1\n)2\n, (37)\nwith e = E\/(nNGkB\u0398).\nTo test condition (25) we take the derivative with re-\nspect to E\u00b5 on both sides,\n\u03b2\nn2\n(\nE\u00b5\u22121 + E\u00b5+1 \u2212 2 E0\nNG\n)\n+\n2\u03b2\nn2\nE0\nNG\n\u2248 c1 (38)\nwhere we have separated the energy dependent and the\nconstant part in the lhs. (38) is satisfied if the energy\ndependent part is much smaller than one,\n\u03b2\nn2\n(\nE\u00b5\u22121 + E\u00b5+1 \u2212 2 E0\nNG\n)\n\u2264 \u03b4 \u226a 1. (39)\nThis condition is hardest to satisfy for high energies. Tak-\ning E\u00b5\u22121 and E\u00b5+1 equal to the upper bound in equation\n(27), it yields\nn >\n2\u03b1\n\u03b4\n\u0398\nT\ne, (40)\nwhere the \u201caccuracy\u201d parameter \u03b4 \u226a 1 quantifies the\nvalue of the energy dependent part in (38).\nSince the constant part in the lhs of (38) satisfies\n2\u03b2\nn2\nE0\nNG\n<\n\u221a\n\u03b4\n\u03b1\n(\n1\u221a\n2\n\u2212\n\u221a\n\u03b4\n\u03b1\n)\n\u226a 1, (41)\ntemperature is intensive.\nInserting equation (34) into equation (37) and (40) one\ncan now calculate the minimal n for given \u03b4, \u03b1,\u0398 and T .\nFigure 3 shows nmin for \u03b1 = 10 and \u03b4 = 0.01 given by\ncriterion (37) and (40) as a function of T\/\u0398. Hence,\nlocal temperature exists, i. e. local states are canonical\nfor all group sizes larger then the maximum of the two\nnmin-curves plotted in figure 3.\n10\u22123 10\u22122 10\u22121 101 102 103\n102\n104\n106\n108\nnmin\nT\/\u0398\nFIG. 3: Log-log-plot of nmin from eq.

Local temperature\nexists in the shaded area.\nFor high (low) temperatures nmin can thus be esti-\nmated by\nnmin \u2248\n{\n2\u03b1\/\u03b4 for T > \u0398(\n3\u03b1\/2pi2\n)\n(\u0398\/T )3 for T < \u0398\n(42)\nEquation (42) also shows the dependence of the results\non the \u201caccuracy parameters\u201d \u03b1 and \u03b4. In the whole tem-\nperature range, nmin \u221d \u03b1, in other words, the larger one\nchooses the energy range where (23) and (25) should be\nfulfilled, the larger has to be the number of particles per\ngroup. Furthermore, for high temperatures, nmin \u221d \u03b4\u22121,\nwhich simply states that one needs more particles per\ngroup to obtain a canonical state with better accuracy.\nSince the resulting minimal group sizes nmin are larger\nthan 103 for all temperatures, the application of the De-\nbye approximation is well justified.\n7IV. ISING SPIN CHAIN IN A TRANSVERSE\nFIELD\nIn this section we consider an Ising spin chain in a\ntransverse field. For this model the Hamiltonian reads\nHi = \u2212B \u03c3zi\nIi,i+1 = \u2212Jx\n2\n\u03c3xi \u2297 \u03c3xi+1 \u2212\nJy\n2\n\u03c3yi \u2297 \u03c3yi+1 (43)\nwhere \u03c3xi , \u03c3\ny\ni and \u03c3\nz\ni are the Pauli matrices. B is the mag-\nnetic field and Jx and Jy are two coupling parameters.\nWe will always assume B > 0.\nThe entire chain with periodic boundary conditions\nmay be diagonalized via successive Jordan-Wigner,\nFourier and Bogoliubov transformations (see appendix\nB). The relevant energy scale is introduced via the ther-\nmal expectation value (without the ground state energy)\nE =\nnNG\n2pi\n\u222b pi\n\u2212pi\ndk\n\u03c9k\nexp (\u03b2 \u03c9k) + 1\n, (44)\nwhere \u03c9k is given in equation (B9). The ground state\nenergy E0 is given by\nE0 = \u2212nNG\n2pi\n\u222b pi\n\u2212pi\ndk\n\u03c9k\n2\n. (45)\nSince NG \u226b 1, the sums over all modes have been re-\nplaced by integrals.\nIf one partitions the chain into NG groups of n sub-\nsystems each, the groups may also be diagonalized via\na Jordan-Wigner and a Fourier transformation (see ap-\npendix B). Using the abbreviations\nK =\nJx + Jy\n2B\nand L =\nJx \u2212 Jy\n2B\n, (46)\nthe energy Ea reads\nEa = 2B\nNG\u2211\n\u00b5=1\n\u2211\nk\n[1\u2212K cos(k)]\n(\nnak(\u00b5)\u2212\n1\n2\n)\n, (47)\nwhere k = pil\/(n + 1) (l = 1, 2, . . . , n) and nak(\u00b5) is the\nfermionic occupation number of mode k of group \u00b5 in the\nstate |a\u3009. It can take on the values 0 and 1.\nFor the Ising model at hand one has, as for the har-\nmonic chain, \u03b5a = 0 for all states |a\u3009, while the squared\nvariance \u22062a reads\n\u22062a =\nNG\u2211\n\u00b5=1\n\u22062\u00b5, (48)\nwith\n\u22062\u00b5 = B\n2\n(\nK2\n2\n+\nL2\n2\n)\n\u2212 (49)\n\u22122B2 (K2 \u2212 L2)\n[\n2\nn+ 1\n\u2211\nk\nsin2(k)\n(\nnak(\u00b5)\u2212\n1\n2\n)]\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\n[\n2\nn+ 1\n\u2211\np\nsin2(p)\n(\nnap(\u00b5+ 1)\u2212\n1\n2\n)]\nwhere the nak(\u00b5) are the same fermionic occupation num-\nbers as in equation (47).\nThe conditions for the central limit theorem are met\nfor the Ising chain apart from two exceptions: Condition\n(15) is always fulfilled as the Hamiltonian of a single spin\nhas finite dimension. As follows from equation (49), con-\ndition (16) is satisfied except for one single state in the\ncase where Jx = Jy (L = 0) and Jx = \u2212Jy (K = 0)\nrespectively. These two states have \u22062\u00b5 = 0 and thus\n\u22062a < NGC\n\u2032. The state for L = 0 is the one where\nall occupation numbers nak(\u00b5) vanish and the state for\nK = 0 is the state with alternating occupation numbers\nnak(\u00b5) = 0, n\na\nk(\u00b5 + 1) = 1, n\na\nk(\u00b5 + 2) = 0, . . . (for all\nk each). As there is, for given parameters, at most one\nstate that does not fulfill (16), the fraction of states where\nour theory does not apply is negligible for NG \u226b 1.\nWe now turn to analyze conditions (23) and (25). Since\nthe spectrum of the Ising chain is limited, there is no ap-\nproximation analog to the Debye approximation for the\nharmonic chain and \u22062\u00b5 cannot be expressed in terms of\nE\u00b5\u22121 and E\u00b5. We therefore approximate (23) and (25)\nwith simpler expressions. The results are thus quanti-\ntatively not as precise as for the harmonic chain, but\nnevertheless yield reliable order of magnitute estimates.\nLet us first analyze condition (23). Since it cannot be\nchecked for every state |a\u3009 we use the stronger condition\nE\u00b5 \u2212 E0\nNG\n> \u03b2\n[\n\u22062\u00b5\n]\nmax\n, (50)\ninstead, which implies that (23) holds for all states |a\u3009.\nWe require (50) to be true for all states with energies in\nthe range (27). It is hardest to satisfy for E\u00b5 = Emin,\nwe thus get the condition on n:\nn > \u03b2\n[\n\u22062\u00b5\n]\nmax\nemin \u2212 e0 , (51)\nwhere emin = Emin\/n and e0 = E0\/(nNG).\nWe now turn to analyze condition (25). Equation (49)\nshows that the \u22062\u00b5 do not contain terms which are pro-\nportional to E\u00b5. One thus has to determine, when the\n\u22062\u00b5 are approximately constant which is the case if\n\u03b2\n[\n\u22062\u00b5\n]\nmax\n\u2212 [\u22062\u00b5]min\n2\n\u226a [E\u00b5]max \u2212 [E\u00b5]min , (52)\nwhere [x]max and [x]min denote the maximal and minimal\nvalue x takes on in all states |a\u3009. As a direct consequence,\nwe get\n|c1| \u226a 1 (53)\nwhich means that temperature is intensive. Defining the\nquantity e\u00b5 = E\u00b5\/n, we can rewrite (52) as a condition\non n,\nn \u2265 \u03b2\n2 \u03b4\n[\n\u22062\u00b5\n]\nmax\n\u2212 [\u22062\u00b5]min\n[e\u00b5]max \u2212 [e\u00b5]min\n(54)\n8where the accuracy parameter \u03b4 \u226a 1 is equal to the ratio\nof the lhs and the rhs of (52).\nSince equation (52) does not take into account the en-\nergy range (27), its application needs some further dis-\ncussion.\nIf the occupation number of one mode of a group is\nchanged, say from nak(\u00b5) = 0 to n\na\nk(\u00b5) = 1, the corre-\nsponding \u22062\u00b5 differ at most by 4B\n2\n\u2223\u2223K2 \u2212 L2\u2223\u2223 \/ (n+ 1).\nOn the other hand,\n[\n\u22062\u00b5\n]\nmax\n\u2212[\u22062\u00b5]min = B2 \u2223\u2223K2 \u2212 L2\u2223\u2223.\nThe state with the maximal \u22062\u00b5 and the state with the\nminimal \u22062\u00b5 thus differ in nearly all occupation num-\nbers and therefore their difference in energy is close to\n[E\u00b5]max\u2212 [E\u00b5]min. On the other hand, states with simi-\nlar energiesE\u00b5 also have a similar \u2206\n2\n\u00b5. Hence the \u2206\n2\n\u00b5 only\nchange quasi continuously with energy and equation (52)\nensures that the \u22062\u00b5 are approximately constant even on\nonly a part of the possible energy range.\nWe are now going to discuss three special coupling\nmodels.\nA. Coupling with constant width \u2206a: Jy = 0\nIf one of the couplings vanishes (Jx = 0 or Jy = 0),\nK = L and \u22062\u00b5 = B\n2K2 is constant. In this case only\ncriterion (23) has to be satisfied, which then coincides\nwith (51).\nPlugging expressions (44), (45) and (49) with Jx = J\nand Jy = 0 into condition (51), one can now calculate\nthe minimal number of systems per group.\n10\u22128 10\u22126 10\u22124 10\u22122 102\n102\n104\n106\n108\nnmin\nT\/B\nFIG. 4: Log-log-plot of nmin from eq.

Then\nfor smaller \u03b1, nmin eventually decays steeper and thus\nreaches nmin = 1 already at lower temperatures. There\nis thus a temperature interval, where nmin is larger for\nlarger \u03b1 and vice versa. This dependency has the same\ninterpretation as for the harmonic chain.\nB. Fully anisotropic coupling: Jx = \u2212Jy\nIf both couplings are nonzero, the variances \u22062\u00b5 are\nnot constant. As an example, we consider here the fully\nanisotropic coupling, where Jx = \u2212Jy, i. e. K = 0.

In this state, \u22062\u00b5 is\nmaximal (\u22062\u00b5 = B\n2 L2) as can be seen from (49). There-\nfore criterion (51) is equivalent to criterion (23) for low\ntemperatures, where Emin = [E\u00b5]min. For high tempera-\ntures, where Emin = E\/(\u03b1NG), condition (51) is slightly\nstronger than (23). For the present model, this is only\nthe case for L = 0.1 (dashed line) and T & 0.45B.\nIn figure 6, the results obtained from equation (54) are\nproportional to \u03b4\u22121 (dash - dotted line and gray line),\nwhile those obtained from equation (51) (dashed line and\nsolid line) have the same dependency on \u03b1 as shown in\nfigure 5.\nC. Isotropic coupling: Jx = Jy\nAs a third example, we consider the isotropic coupling,\nwhere Jx = Jy, i. e. L = 0. Again, both criteria (51)\nand (54) have to be met.\nThe values of\n[\n\u22062\u00b5\n]\nmax\n,\n[\n\u22062\u00b5\n]\nmin\n, [e\u00b5]max and [e\u00b5]min\nare given in equations (B11), (B12) and (B13)\nFor the present model with L = 0 and |K| < 1 all oc-\ncupation numbers nak(\u00b5) are zero in the ground state and\nthus \u22062\u00b5 = 0. As a consequence, condition (51) cannot\nbe used instead of (23). We therefore argue as follows:\nIn the ground state E\u00b5 \u2212 E0\/NG = 0 as well as \u22062\u00b5 = 0\nand all occupation numbers nak(\u00b5) are zero. If one occu-\npation number is then changed from 0 to 1, \u22062\u00b5 changes\nat most by 4B2K2\/(n + 1) and E\u00b5 changes at least by\n2B (1\u2212|K|).

For each coupling strength K, the\nstronger condition, that is the higher curve in figure 7,\nsets the relevant lower bound to the group size n.\nEquation (55) does not take into account the relevant\nenergy range (27), it is therefore possible that a weaker\ncondition could be sufficient in that case. However, since\n(54) is a stronger condition than (55) for K = 0.1, this\npossibility has no relevance.\nFor strong coupling, K = 10 (51) is used to approxi-\nmate (23). This approximation is expected to be good\nbecause \u2206\u00b5 is close to its maximal value for low energy\n10\u22126 10\u22124 10\u22122 102 104\n102\n104\n106\n108\n1010\n1012\nnmin\nT\/B\nFIG. 7: Log-log-plot of nmin for K = 0.1 from eq.

Furthermore, the temperature dependence we ob-\ntain here for nmin for low temperatures is the same as\nfor the harmonic chain, nmin \u221d T\u22123. This agreement\nis to be expected: The two couplings, when expressed in\ncreation and annihilation operators, have the same struc-\nture and the upper limit of the spectrum of the spin chain\nbecomes irrelevant at low temperatures.\nFor the present model, the dependence of the results\non the \u201caccuracy parameters\u201d \u03b1 and \u03b4 is as follows. Re-\nsults obtained from equation (54) are proportional to \u03b4\u22121\n(dash - dotted line and gray line), while the result ob-\ntained from equation (51) (solid line) has the same de-\npendency on \u03b1 as shown in figure 5.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\nWe have considered a linear chain of particles interact-\ning with their nearest neighbors. We have partitioned the\nchain into identical groups of n adjoining particles each.\nTaking the number of such groups to be very large and\nassuming the total system to be in a thermal state with\ntemperature T we have found conditions (equations (23)\nand (25)), which ensure that each group is approximately\nin a thermal state. Furthermore, we have determined\nwhen the isolated groups have the same temperature T ,\nthat is when temperature is intensive.\nThe result shows that, in the quantum regime, these\nconditions depend on the temperature T , contrary to the\nclassical case. The characteristics of the temperature de-\npendence are determined by the width \u2206a of the distri-\nbution of the total energy eigenvalues in a product state\nand its dependence on the group energies Ea. The low\ntemperature behavior, in particular, is related to the fact\nthat \u2206a has a nonzero minimal value. This fact does not\nonly appear in the harmonic chain or spin chains but is\na general feature of quantum systems composed of inter-\nacting particles or subsystems. The commutator [H,H0]\n10\nis nonzero and the ground state of the total system is en-\nergetically lower than the lowest product state, therefore\n\u2206a is nonzero, even at zero temperature [25, 35, 39, 40].\nWe have then applied the general method to a har-\nmonic chain and several types of Ising spin chains. For\nconcrete models, the conditions (23) and (25) determine\na minimal group size and thus a minimal length scale\non which temperature may be defined according to the\ntemperature concept we adopt. Grains of size below this\nlength scale are no more in a thermal state. Thus tem-\nperature measurements with a higher resolution should\nno longer be interpreted in a standard way.\nWe have given order of magnitude estimates for the\nminimal group size (minimal length scale) for the models\nmentioned above. The most striking difference between\nthe spin chains and the harmonic chain is that the energy\nspectrum of the spin chains is limited, while it is infinite\nfor the harmonic chain.\nFor spins at very high global temperatures, the to-\ntal density matrix is then almost completely mixed, i.\ne. proportional to the identity matrix, and thus does\nnot change under basis transformations. There are thus\nglobal temperatures which are high enough, so that local\ntemperatures exist even for single spins.\nFor the harmonic chain, this feature does not appear,\nsince the size of the relevant energy range increases indef-\ninitely with growing global temperature, leading to the\nconstant minimal length scale in the high energy range.\nFor the spin chain with isotropic coupling, Jx = Jy,\nand the harmonic chain, the temperature dependencies\nof nmin for low temperatures coincide, nmin \u221d T\u22123, be-\ncause both couplings have the same structure and the\nupper limit of the spectrum of the spin chain becomes\nirrelevant at low temperatures.\nThe spin chain with Jx = 0 or Jy = 0 shows the inter-\nesting feature that \u22062a is constant and condition (25) is\nautomatically fulfilled.\nThe set of models we have discussed is by no means\nexhaustive. It would be particularly interesting to see\nwhether there are systems for which local temperatures\ncan exist although they are not intensive. This can hap-\npen if either \u03b5a or \u2206\n2\na were proportional to Ea. \u2206\n2\na how-\never has dimension energy squared, so that it cannot be\nproportional to Ea unless there exists another character-\nistic energy of the system independent of Ea. So far, we\nhave not found models where \u03b5a \u221d Ea.\nFor the models we consider here, the off diagonal ele-\nments of the density operator in the product basis, \u3008a|\u03c1\u02c6|b\u3009\n(a 6= b), are significantly smaller than the diagonal ones,\n\u3008a|\u03c1\u02c6|a\u3009. Our general result, conditions (23) and (25),\nthus states that the density matrix \u03c1\u02c6 \u201capproximately\u201d\nfactorizes with respect to the considered partition. This\nimplies that the state \u03c1\u02c6 is not entangled with respect\nto this partition, at least within the chosen accuracy.\nIt would therefore be interesting to see how our result\nrelates to the scaling of entanglement in many particle\nsystems [38].\nUnfortunately, our approach only applies to nonzero\ntemperatures. The underlying central limit theorem\n[29, 31] is about the weak convergence of the distribu-\ntion of energy eigenvalues. Weak convergence means that\nonly integrals over energy intervals of nonzero length do\nconverge. We thus cannot make statements about a sys-\ntem in its groundstate let alone about the entanglement\nin that state.\nSince harmonic lattice models in Debye approximation\nhave proven to be successful in modeling thermal prop-\nerties of insulators (e.g. heat capacity) [34], our calcula-\ntion for the harmonic chain provides a first estimate of\nthe minimal length scale on which intensive temperatures\nexist in insulating solids,\nlmin = nmin a0. (56)\nLet us give some numerical estimates: Choosing the \u201cac-\ncuracy parameters\u201d to be \u03b1 = 10 and \u03b4 = 0.01, we get\nfor hot iron (T \u226b \u0398 \u2248 470K, a0 \u2248 2.5 A\u02da) lmin \u2248 50\u00b5m,\nwhile for carbon (\u0398 \u2248 2230K, a0 \u2248 1.5 A\u02da) at room tem-\nperature (270K) lmin \u2248 10\u00b5m. The coarse-graining will\nexperimentally be most relevant at very low tempera-\ntures, where lmin may even become macroscopic. A per-\ntinent example is silicon (\u0398 \u2248 645K, a0 \u2248 2.4 A\u02da), which\nhas lmin \u2248 10 cm at T \u2248 1K (again with \u03b1 = 10 and\n\u03b4 = 0.01).\nOf course the validity of the harmonic lattice model\nwill eventually break down at finit, high temperatures\nand our estimates will thus no longer apply there.\nMeasurable consequences of the local breakdown of the\nconcept of temperature and their implications for future\nnanotechnology are interesting questions which arise in\nthe context of the present discussion.\nIn the secnarios of global equilibrium, which we con-\nsider here, a temperature measurement with a micro-\nscopic thermometer, locally in thermal contact with the\nlarge chain, would not reveal the non existence of local\ntemperature. One can model such a measurement with a\nsmall system, representing the thermometer, coupled to\na heat bath, representing the chain. It is a known result\nof such system bath models [41], that the system always\nrelaxes to a thermal state with the global temperature of\nthe bath, no matter how local the coupling might be.\nThis, however, does not mean that the existence or non\nexistence of local temperatures had no physical relevance:\nThere are indeed physical properties, which are deter-\nmined by the local states rather than the global ones.\nWhether these properties are of thermal character de-\npends on the existence of local temperatures. A detailed\ndiscussion of such properties will be given elsewhere.\nThe length scales, calculated in this paper, should also\nconstrain the way one can meaningfully define tempera-\nture profiles in non-equilibrium scenarios [42]. Here, tem-\nperature measurements with a microscopic thermome-\nter, which is locally in thermal contact with the sample,\nmight indeed be suitable to measure the local temper-\nature. An explicit study of this possibility should be\nsubject of future research.\n11\nWe thank M. Michel, M. Henrich, H. Schmidt, M.\nStollsteimer, F. Tonner and C.
