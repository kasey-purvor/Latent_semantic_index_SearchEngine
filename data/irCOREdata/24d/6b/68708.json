INTRODUCTION\nFirst of all, we are much indebted to the Editorial Board\nof the journal Low Temperature Physics for their invitation to\nreport the results of our recent studies in this special issue\ndevoted to 100th anniversary of the famous scientist A. F.\nPrikhot\u2019ko.\nWe review here experimental and theoretical investiga-\ntions of the peculiarities of nonlinear evolution of solitary\nsecond and first sound pulses propagating in superfluid 4He,\nand of a second sound standing wave in a high-Q resonator\nfilled with He II, the superfluid phase of 4He. Entropy waves\n\u0001second sound\u0002 are a macroscopic quantum effect that may\nbe observed in superfluids and perfect crystals.1\u20133 The prop-\nerties of second sound in He II have been studied exten-\nsively, both experimentally and theoretically. More recently,\nattention has been focused on the nonlinear acoustic proper-\nties of He II.4\u20138\nIt is known1\u20133,9\u201311 that second sound is characterized by\nrather strong nonlinear properties. These lead to the forma-\ntion of a shock wave \u0001temperature discontinuity\u0002 during the\npropagation of a finite-amplitude wave in He II, at short\ndistances from the source \u0001heater\u0002. The velocity of a travel-\ning second sound wave depends on its amplitude and, to a\nfirst approximation, can be written:\nu2 = u20\u00011 + \u0001\u0003T2\u0002 , \u00011\u0002\nwhere \u0003T2 is the wave amplitude, u20 is the velocity of a\nwave of infinitely small amplitude, and \u0001 is the nonlinearity\ncoefficient of second sound, which is determined by the\nrelation2\n\u0001 =\n\u0002\n\u0002T\nln\u0005u203 CT \u0006 , \u00012\u0002\nwhere C is the heat capacity per unit mass of liquid helium at\nconstant pressure, and T is the temperature.\nThe nonlinearity coefficient \u0001 of second sound may be\neither positive or negative, depending on the temperature and\npressure.2,10,12 Under the saturated vapor pressure \u0001SVP\u0002, in\nthe region of roton second sound \u0001i.e., at T\u00040.9 K\u0002 the non-\nlinearity coefficient is positive \u0001\u0001\u00040\u0002 at temperatures T\n\u0005T\u0001=1.88 K \u0001like the nonlinearity coefficient of conven-\ntional sound waves in ordinary media\u0002, but it is negative in\nthe range T\u0001\u0005T\u0005T\u0002. Here T\u0002=2.176 K is the temperature\nLOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS VOLUME 32, NUMBER 11 NOVEMBER 2006\n1063-777X\/2006\/32\u000311\u0001\/9\/$26.00 \u00a9 2006 American Institute of Physics999\nof the superfluid-to-normal \u0001He II to He I\u0002 transition. At T\n=T\u0001 the nonlinearity coefficient passes through zero.\nIf T\u0004T\u0001, the nonlinear evolution leads to the creation of\na shock in the profile of a traveling second sound pulse.\nDuring the propagation of a plane, one-dimensional wave of\nheating \u0001compression\u0002 of second sound \u0001\u0003T2\u00040\u0002, the shock\nappears at the front of the propagating wave at temperatures\n1 K\u0005T\u0005T\u0001, and on the trailing edge of the wave for tem-\nperatures T\u0001\u0005T\u0005T\u0002 \u0001see, for example, Fig. 1\u0002. The width of\nthe shock front lf is defined by both the nonlinearity coeffi-\ncient \u0001 and the dissipation coefficient \u0006 of second sound. In\nthe hydrodynamic regime, where the shock front width ex-\nceeds greatly the mean free path of rotons, one has lf\n=\u0006 \/\u0001\u0003T2 for the shock front width, and v f =u20+\u0001\u0003T2 \/2 for\nthe velocity of shock propagation.1,2\nAt large distances L from the heater the profile of a\none-dimensional shock pulse eventually acquires a triangular\nform. The dependence of the length of the triangle \u0001duration\nof the pulse \u0007\u0002 and its height \u0001the temperature jump at the\nshock front \u0003T2\u0002 on the distance can be described by a uni-\nversal power law\n\u0007 = const\u0001\u0001L\u00021\/2, \u0003T2 = const\u0001\u0001L\u0002\u22121\/2, \u00013\u0002\nwhere the constants depend on the initial shape of the second\nsound pulse. It is important to note here that the evolution of\na developed shock wave \u0001i.e., the dependence of the param-\neters of the triangle on distance\u0002 is governed only by the\nvalue of the nonlinearity coefficient and does not depend on\nthe value of the dissipation coefficient \u0006. The entropy pro-\nduction rate dS \/dt at the shock front due to dissipative pro-\ncesses remains finite as the dissipation coefficient \u0001 tends to\nzero, because the small value of \u0006 is compensated by a large\ntemperature gradient dT \/dx\u0007\u0003T2 \/ lf.\nII. PROPAGATION OF NONLINEAR SECOND SOUND\nPULSES IN He II\nA. Evolution of the shape of second sound pulses with\nreduction of the temperature\nThe experimental arrangements were similar to those\nused in our earlier studies of nonlinear and shock second\nsound pulse propagation in He II.9,11 Figure 1a shows the\nevolution in shape of planar second sound pulses excited by\na rectangular heat pulse at temperature T=2.10 K under\npressure P=3 atm \u0001\u0001\u00050\u0002.12 The time duration of the elec-\ntrical pulse applied to the resistive heater was \u0007e=10 \bs. The\nnumbers beside the curves correspond to different heat flux\ndensities W from the heater. The waves were detected by a\nsuperconducting film bolometer.13 At small W\u00050.7 W\/cm2\nthe bolometer detected linear waves \u0001curves, 1, 2\u0002 of ampli-\ntude \u0003T2 proportional to W. Above W=1 W\/cm2 and up to\n17 W\/cm2 the pulse shape is close to triangular \u0001linear\nwaves transform to planar shock waves, curves 3\u20135\u0002. The\namplitude of the triangular pulse \u0003T2 and its width increase\nin proportion to W1\/2. Above 30 W\/cm2 \u0001curves 6 and 7\u0002 the\namplitude and the width of the pulse depend weakly on W\n\u0001the range of saturation\u0002.\nFigure 1b shows the evolution of the profile of a second\nsound pulse at T=1.50 K \u0001\u0001\u00040\u0002 under the SVP, P= PSVP,\nwhile the heat flux density increases from W\n=2.4 W\/cm2 to 20.2 W\/cm2, at a constant distance L\n=2.5 cm from the heater.14 The heater pulse duration was\n\u0007e=10 \bs. We see that the slope of profile a=\u0003T2 \/\u0007 does not\ndepend on W: in accordance with the general relations \u00013\u0002,\nthe value a=u2 \/\u0001L.\nCreation of the shock on the trailing edge of a compres-\nsion wave at T\u0004T\u0001 \u0001or at the front of a rarefaction wave for\n\u0003T2\u00050\u0002 is a specific property of second sound in He II.2 At\ntemperatures very close to T\u0001 the nonlinearity coefficient\ntends to infinity according to the power law7 \u0001\u0007\t\u22121, where\n\t= \u0001T\u0002\u2212T\u0002 \/T\u0002 is the reduced temperature. Near the lambda\ntransition the nonlinearity therefore plays a crucial role even\nfor the smallest amplitudes \u0003T2.\nWe discuss here the evolution in the shape of short sec-\nond sound pulses of relatively small amplitude \b\u0003T2\b\n\u000510\u22122 K, so that we can neglect possible creation of quan-\ntum vortices at the shock front and the resultant wave-vortex\ninteractions. For small amplitudes, the description of the\nnonlinear evolution of the second sound wave can be con-\nfined to the first terms in the expansion of the velocity u2 in\n\u0003T2, as done in Eq. \u00011\u0002. Under this approximation the ampli-\ntude of a second sound pulse at small W \u0001linear wave\u0002 should\nbe proportional to W, i.e., \u0003T2\nW\nU2 \u0001here U is a voltage\napplied to the heater\u0002. At higher W, where a shock wave is\nformed, the amplitude of the propagating triangular pulse\nshould be proportional to \u0003T2\nW1\/2\nU.\nThe experimental dependence of the amplitude of the\npulse plotted as \u0003T2\u0001U\u0002 \u0001left-side scale, open circles\u0002 and\nFIG. 1.

A similar depen-\ndence was observed at P=3 atm and T=1.7 K, where the\nnonlinearity coefficient \u0001\u00040. All the curves \u0003T2\u0001U\u0002 ob-\nserved at different pressures and temperatures in our studies\nlook much the same. Similar saturation effects at high W\nwere reported in Refs. 15 and 16. A detailed discussion of the\nreasons for the saturation lies beyond the scope of the present\npaper, but one reason could be the attenuation of the propa-\ngating second sound wave by vortices in the bulk of the He\nII.17 However it follows from our observations \u0001see Sec.\nII D\u0002 that, along with the nonlinear second sound wave, a\nheater should also generate a first sound shock wave of com-\npression before the \u0003T2\u0001U\u0002 curves saturate. We may infer,\nfirst, that a significant part of the energy could be expended\nin the creation of this wave and, secondly, that vortices can\nbe generated initially by the shock wave of first sound propa-\ngating ahead of the second sound shock wave.\nIt is known6 that, if a three-dimensional \u0001spherical\u0002 sec-\nond sound wave is generated in He II by a point-like heater,\nthen the propagating wave of heating \u0001compression\u0002 is fol-\nlowed by a wave of cooling \u0001rarefaction\u0002; see Fig. 3. In the\nrange of temperatures T\u0001\u0005T\u0005T\u0002, where the nonlinearity\ncoefficient is negative, the temperature discontinuity \u0001the\nshock\u0002 is created at the center of a traveling pulse. Conse-\nquently, the duration of the pulse does not change with the\ndistance propagated6,14 \u0001see Fig. 3b\u0002. This feature is impor-\ntant, e.g., for easier investigation of nonlinear and dissipative\nphenomena in the close vicinity of T\u0001 in He II, especially at\nelevated pressures.\nB. Propagation of nonlinear second sound waves in\ncompressed He II\nThermodynamic characteristics of He II, such as the heat\ncapacity C, the second sound velocity u20, and the tempera-\nture of the phase transition T\u0002, change considerably upon\nchanges in pressure. The dependence of the nonlinearity co-\nefficient on pressure \u0001see above\u0002 was discussed in detail in\nRefs. 12 and 18.\nFigure 4a shows the dependence of the nonlinearity co-\nefficient \u0001 on temperature for P= PSVP \u0001curve 1\u0002\n2\nand for\nelevated pressures of P=5, 10, 15, and 25 atm \u0001curves\n2\u20135\u0002,18 respectively. The dependences \u0001\u0001P ,T\u0002 for P\u0004PSVP\nwere calculated by using Eq. \u00011\u0002 and known dependences3\nfor the heat capacity C\u0001P ,T\u0002 and the second sound velocity\nu2\u0001P ,T\u0002. It can be seen from Fig. 4a that the temperature T\u0001\ndecreases from 1.8 to 1.58 K as the pressure is increased up\nto 25 atm.\nThe pressure dependence of T\u0001, the temperature at which\nthe nonlinearity coefficient of second sound in He II passes\nthrough zero, is shown by the dotted curve in Fig. 4b. The\ncircles correspond to our experimental data. The dependence\n\u0001\u0001T\u0002 at fixed pressure was obtained from experimental ob-\nservations of the evolution in shape of the planar shock sec-\nond sound pulse with changing bath temperature T or heat\nflux density W. It is evident that the experimental data agree\nwell with the results of our computations. The solid curves in\nFig. 4b were reconstructed from the data available in the\nliterature.3 They describe the temperature dependence of the\nsolidification pressure and the pressure dependence of the\nsuperfluid transition temperature T\u0002.\nIt follows from Fig. 4b that, at all pressures up to that of\nsolidification, there exists a fairly wide temperature range\nT\u0001\u0005T\u0005T\u0002 below T\u0002, in which the nonlinearity coefficient\nof the second sound \u0001 is negative. According to Fig. 3b, in\nthis range the bipolar pulse of second sound propagating into\nthe bulk of He II from a point-like heater should transform to\na shock wave of constant duration with the discontinuity\nplaced at its center. These are important considerations for\nstudies in the vicinity of T\u0002 at elevated pressures.\nFIG. 2.

Peculiarities of the generation of second and first sound\nwaves by a film heater in He II at high heat flux\ndensity\nWe have studied the evolution in shape of the first sound\nwave that is excited, together with the second sound wave,\nby a heater in superfluid He II at elevated pressures.\nWe recall \u0001see above\u0002 that, for all W, a pulsed heater in\nHe II should excite ordinary first sound \u0001pressure\/density\nwaves\u0002 as well as second sound \u0001entropy\/temperature\nwaves\u0002. The thermal expansion coefficient \r of He II is\nnegative at temperatures above 1.2 K, \r=\u2212\u00011\/\u000b\u0002\u0001\u0002\u000b \/\u0002T\u0002s\n\u00050 \u0001here \u000b is the density of bulk liquid\u0002. So, a quasi-\nadiabatic plane linear wave of first sound \u0001the wave of heat-\ning of amplitude \u0003T1\u00040\u0002, excited by a heater, is a wave of\nrarefaction: \u0003\u000b=\u000b\r\u0003T1\u00050.\nAt low heat flux densities W, the energy contained in the\nfirst sound wave is much less than that in the second sound\nwave. For this reason, the amplitude \u0003T1 of the temperature\noscillations in quasi-adiabatic first sound should be much\nsmaller than the amplitude \u0003T2 of the second sound wave.\nUsing the relations presented in Refs. 1, 2, and 4, one can\nestimate that at small pressures close to SVP \u0001P\n\u000e0.05 atm\u0002, the amplitude ratio is very small \u0003T1 \/\u0003T2\u000b2\n\u000f10\u22124. Therefore in experiments with linear second sound\nwaves with amplitude \u0003T2\u00051 mK, the amplitude of the first\nsound wave excited by a heater should be \u0003T1\u00050.2 \bK.\nThis value is beneath the typical resolution of a supercon-\nducting bolometer. But at high heat flux densities, at which\nthe amplitude of the second sound wave was close to satu-\nration \u0001Fig. 2\u0002, the bolometer had registered arrival of the\nfirst sound wave of compression \u0001a shock wave with \u0003\u000b\u00040\nand \u0003T\u00050\u0002. Creation of the shock wave of the first sound\nwas associated typically with the film boiling of superfluid\nFIG. 4.

Figure 6 demonstrates the dependence on\ntemperature of the derivative \u0001\u0002P \/\u0002T\u0002s in a quasi-adiabatic\nfirst sound wave in both He II and He I, calculated for dif-\nferent pressures P. A jump in the dependence at a given\npressure arises due to the discontinuity in the temperature\ndependence of the thermal expansion coefficient \r that oc-\ncurs at a temperature slightly above T\u0002 \u0001for example, in He I\nat P= PSVP the coefficient \r changes both its value and sign\nfrom negative to positive at T=T\u0002+0.006 K\u0002.21 Figure 7\nshows the calculated ratio of amplitudes of temperature os-\ncillations \u0003T1 \/\u0003T2 in linear waves of first and second sound\nemitted by a film heater in superfluid He II at different pres-\nsures P. It follows from Figs. 6 and 7 that the temperature\noscillations in the wave of first sound generated by a heater\nimmersed in the superfluid should increase considerably with\nrising pressure P. It follows from Fig. 8 that, as the pressure\nis increased up to 15 atm, the ratio \u0003T1 \/\u0003T2 at T=1.9 K in-\ncreases by an order of magnitude.\nConsistent with earlier work,4,22 we were unable to de-\ntect the linear waves of heating due to first sound in He II\nwithin the resolution of our bolometer \u0001threshold about 5\n\u000f10\u22126 K\u0002 for pressures below 10 atm. The amplitude of a\nlinear wave of the first sound could not be increased signifi-\ncantly by increasing the heat flux density W: at high W the\nbolometer detected the arrival of a wave of cooling of the\nfirst sound, i.e., a compression wave \u0001\u0003T1\u00050, \u0003\u000b\u00040\u0002 in-\nstead of a wave of heating.\nOn increasing the pressure to 13.3 atm, the bolometer\ndetected the propagation in bulk He II of both waves of\nheating\u2014linear first sound waves of rarefaction and second\nsound waves of compression, with heater pulses of relatively\nsmall W. With increase of W, first sound waves of rarefaction\nwere transformed into waves of compression \u0001cooling\u0002, and\nthen into a shock sound wave with its discontinuity \u0001a step-\nwise jump of pressure and temperature\u0002 situated at the front\nof the traveling wave.\nThe threshold for creation of a first sound compression\nwave was observed at pressures both below the critical pres-\nsure \u0001Pcr=2.2 atm\u0002 and above it where no liquid-vapor inter-\nface can exist. In the latter case, film boiling near the surface\nof the pulsed heater is obviously impossible. Creation of the\nwave of compression in He II can be attributed to the strong\nexpansion of a normal He I layer created at the heater-fluid\ninterface for W\u0004Wcr; see discussion below. Note here that in\nHe I the thermal expansion coefficient \r is positive, and its\nvalue is unusually high, about 10\u22122 K\u22121. We observed a\nchange in sign of the shock wave of compression when the\ntemperature of the bath was increased above T\u0002. As men-\ntioned above, at pressures below the critical pressure one\nshould also take account of pulse film boiling of helium at\nthe interface.\nTypical dependences of the amplitude of temperature os-\ncillations in the first sound waves \u0003T1 \u0001in arbitrary units\u0002 in\nHe II at pressures P=1, 3, and 5 atm and temperatures T\n=2.1 K and 1.76 K on the voltage U of the heater pulse are\nshown in Fig. 8.

Open circles, squares, and diamonds corre-\nspond to T=2.10 K and P=5, 3, and 1 atm, respectively;\nsolid circles and squares correspond to T=1.76 K and P=5\nand 3 atm.\nIt should be emphasized that similar voltage depen-\ndences \u0003T1\u0001U\u0002 were observed at other pressures between 1\nand 9 atm. In all cases the bolometer detected initiation of\nthe first sound shock wave of cooling \u0001compression\u0002 with\n\u0003T1\u00050, \u0003\u000b\u00040, just as in previous studies.4,6 As can be seen\nfrom Fig. 8, the cooling shock waves were created at heat\nflux densities beyond some critical value Wcr, which is equal\nto about 10 W\/cm2 for T=2.1 K and about 30 W\/cm2 for\nT=1.76 K. These values are of the order of the heat flux\ndensities at which saturation of the second sound pulse am-\nplitude takes place, as can be seen in Fig. 1.\nUsually, saturation of the \u0003T2\u0001U\u0002 curve at high W is\nattributed to the interaction of the traveling second sound\npulse with vortices.17 It follows from our measurements that\naccount should also be taken of the possible formation of\nvortices at the heater-fluid He interface; they can also be\ngenerated by the first sound shock wave propagating along a\nwaveguide ahead of the shock wave of second sound.\nFigure 9 shows the oscillograms illustrating the evolu-\ntion of shape of the first sound pulses in compressed He II at\nP=13 atm and T=1.895 K with increasing heat flux density.\nThe heater pulse duration \u0007 was 3 \bs. The numbers beside\nthe curves indicate the voltage U applied to the heater. A\ndetailed picture of the evolution of the shapes of first sound\npulses of different initial duration, from 0.3 to 10 \bs, has\nbeen presented earlier.23\nThe curves plotted in Fig. 9 provide a clear illustration\nof the transformation of the wave of heating \u0001rarefaction\u0002\ninto the wave of cooling \u0001compression\u0002 with increasing heat\nflux density, for U above 15 V. It can be seen that the wave\nof compression is accompanied by a wave of heating \u0001rar-\nefaction\u0002, which is formed at the moment when the heater\npulse is switched off. The wave of compression is associated\nwith the pulsed thermal expansion of the layer of He I cre-\nated at the heater-fluid He interface in the process of heating.\nSimilarly, the subsequent wave of rarefaction might be attrib-\nuted to a fast contraction of the liquid layer when the heat\nflux was switched off.\nThe dependence of the first sound pulse amplitude \u0003T1\n\u0001in arbitrary units\u0002 on the voltage applied to the heater, for\ndifferent \u0007 is presented in Fig. 10. The heat pulse duration is\nmarked on the plots. The solid points correspond to a rar-\nefaction wave, and the open points correspond to a compres-\nsion wave. As might be expected, the straight line \u0003T1\n1\/2\n\u0007U drawn through the solid points passes through the origin\nof coordinates.\nWe estimated the ratio of the slopes of the straight lines\n\u0003T1\n1\/2\n=k1U and \u0003T2\n1\/2\n=k2U describing for small U the depen-\ndences of the amplitudes \u0003T1= f\u0001U\u0002 and \u0003T2= f\u0001U\u0002 of linear\nfirst and second sound waves of heating excited in He II.

The\nobserved transformation from a wave of rarefaction to a\nwave of compression of first sound indicates that the heat\ntransfer mechanism at the heater-He II interface changes\nqualitatively for a heat flux density above the critical level\nWcr. As mentioned above, the appearance of the first sound\nwaves of compression in superfluid He II at elevated pres-\nsures should be attributed to the strong thermal expansion of\na layer of normal liquid He I created at the heater-He II\ninterface at high heat loads. At low pressures P\u0011Pcr, pulse\nfilm boiling was previously supposed to be the principal\nmechanism leading to the excitation of the first sound shock\nwaves, and this additional effect must also be taken into\naccount.\nIII. NONLINEAR DYNAMICS OF STANDING SECOND SOUND\nWAVES IN A HIGH-QUALITY RESONATOR FILLED\nWITH He II\nIn this Section we present the results of our recent stud-\nies of nonlinear second sound wave interactions in a high-\nquality \u0001high-Q\u0002 cylindrical resonator filled with He II.\nThe inner construction of the experimental cell was simi-\nlar to that used in earlier investigations of planar second\nsound pulses.5,12 The resonator was formed by a cylindrical\nquartz tube L=7 cm in length and D=1.5 cm in diameter,\nwhose ends were capped by a pair of flat, parallel, quartz\nplates. Second sound waves were generated by a film heater\non one plate and were detected by a superconducting film\nbolometer on the opposite plate. The resistance of the heater\nwas R=35 \u0012 at T=2 K. The sensitivity of the bolometer was\nvaried from 1.2 to 2.6 V\/K at temperatures 1.79 K\u0005T\n\u00052.08 K.\nThe frequency of the second sound wave fd=2fg excited\nby such a heater is twice the frequency fg of the generator.\nThis frequency doubling occurs because the heat flux from\nthe heater is proportional to the squared voltage applied to\nthe heater, W\u0001t\u0002\nU2\u0001t\u0002, where U\u0001t\u0002=Ug sin\u00012\u0013fgt\u0002 is the\nvoltage applied to the heater. The signal from the bolometer\nwas taken to a preamplifier, digitized with an analog-to-\ndigital converter, and recorded on the hard disk of a com-\nputer. Before being recorded, each signal was averaged au-\ntomatically over 6-8 measurements to reduce electrical noise.\nFigure 11 shows the dependence of the amplitude of the\nrecorded signal on the driving frequency fd, at T=2.075 K.\nThe amplitude of the driving voltage was Ug=1.88 V, so the\nac heat flux density was W=0.02 W\/cm2. The peaks at the\nfrequencies f =3020, 3120, 3220, and 3320 Hz correspond to\nexcitation of longitudinal standing second sound waves of\nfrequencies\nfp = pu2\u0001T\u0002\/2L ,\nwhere p=30, 31, 32, and 33 are the resonance numbers.\nOther, smaller peaks correspond to the generation of radial\nmodes in the cylindrical resonator. The Q factor of the reso-\nnator determined from the data of Fig. 11 for longitudinal\nwaves with p\u000410 was Q\u00071000.\nWe have observed a marked broadening of resonant\npeaks like those of Fig. 11 when the pulsed voltage applied\nto the heater exceeds Ug1=3.75 V \u0001i.e., at W\u00140.08 W\/cm2\u0002.\nThis phenomenon is believed to be attributable to interaction\nof the second sound wave with quantised vortex filaments,\nleading in turn to a nonlinear broadening of the resonances.\nIn what follows below, we discuss only the results of mea-\nsurements made at small Ug\u0005Ug1.\nSteady-state spectra of the standing second sound wave\nin a resonator were analysed by computing Fourier trans-\nforms of the signals. As an example, the spectrum of a signal\nrecorded when driving at a frequency equal to the 11th lon-\ngitudinal resonant frequency of the cell, fd= f11=1088 Hz at\nT=2.075 K, is shown in Fig. 12. It is clearly evident that the\nmain spectral peak lies at the driving frequency fd, and that\nhigh-frequency peaks appear at harmonics, fn= fd\u000fn, where\nn=2,3 , . . .\nFIG. 11.

Phys. 32 \u000311\u0001, November 2006 Kolmakov et al. 1005\nIt is seen that a cascade of waves is formed over a wide\nrange of frequencies up to f =40 kHz, i.e., up to frequencies\n40\u000f higher than the frequency of the second sound f11 gen-\nerated by the heater.\nFollowing the general ideas formulated in Refs. 1, 24,\nand 25, one can associate formation of the cascade with the\nestablishment of a steady-state directed flux of wave energy\nthrough the wavelength scales towards higher frequencies.\nFormation of this cascade is similar to the creation of the\nKolmogorov distribution of fluid velocity over frequencies\nobserved in classical liquids.1 At high frequencies the ampli-\ntudes of the harmonics are decreased. In this high-frequency\ndomain the nonlinear mechanism for almost nondissipative\ntransfer of the wave energy must change to viscous damping\nof the waves \u0001cf. observations26 of the high-frequency edge\nof the inertial range of frequencies in the system of nonlinear\ncapillary waves on the surface of liquid hydrogen\u0002, and the\nenergy flux will then be absorbed due to viscous energy loss\nin this frequency domain. Observation of the cascade is in\nqualitative agreement with the results of our previous nu-\nmerical studies27,28 of nonlinear second sound standing\nwaves in He II in a high-Q resonator. In papers27,28 it was\nshown that, even if the amplitude of the periodic driving\nforce is relatively small, a turbulent cascade of second sound\nwaves of frequencies equal to multiples of the driving fre-\nquency should be formed over a wide range of frequencies\nwhen the Q factor of the resonator is sufficiently high. Thus,\nwe may infer that a wave turbulent state in the system of\nsecond sound waves has indeed been formed in the experi-\nments in the frequency domain up to 40 kHz.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nOur investigations have shown that, at all pressures up to\nthe pressure of solidification of He II, there exists a relatively\nwide temperature range below T\u0002 where the nonlinearity co-\nefficient of second sound is negative. At these temperatures\nthe shock front \u0001the temperature discontinuity\u0002 is formed on\nthe trailing edge of the plane wave, or at the center of a\npropagating bipolar second sound pulse of finite amplitude\ngenerated by a point heater. The width of the bipolar pulse\ndoes not change with distance, so such pulses can be of a\nwide use in studies of nonlinear and dissipative phenomena\nin the vicinity of the superfluid transition line.\nObservations of the transformation of the first sound\nwaves of rarefaction to compression waves at heat flux den-\nsity W higher than some critical value imply that the heat\nexchange mechanism at the pulsed heater-He II interface\nchanges essentially above Wcr: the main reason for excitation\nof the compression waves in He II at pressures above the\ncritical pressure is strong thermal expansion of the layer of\nnormal fluid He I arising at the interface for high W, accom-\npanied by fast contraction of the layer after completion of the\nheat pulse. At pressures below Pcr one should consider also\nthe film boiling of the liquid at the interface. Both mecha-\nnisms explain the generation of the wave of compression\n\u0001cooling\u0002 followed by a subsequent wave of rarefaction\n\u0001heating\u0002 of the first sound in He II at high heat loads.\nAll these processes should be taken into account in a\ndiscussion of the peculiarities of the behavior of first and\nsecond sound waves generated in superfluid helium by pow-\nerful heat pulses. We have observed for the first time the\ncreation of a cascade of standing second sound waves in He\nII in a high-Q resonator, formed at frequencies higher than\nthat at which the system is driven, over a wide range of\nfrequencies. The cascade is formed due to the nonlinear in-\nteractions between second sound standing waves in the reso-\nnator. At high frequencies the nonlinear mechanism of trans-\nfer of the wave energy is changed to viscous damping of the\nwaves, thus terminating the cascade.\nThe authors are grateful to A. A.
