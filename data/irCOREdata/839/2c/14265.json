Lifelong learning is critical for successful participation in today's\ncompetitive work environment. This paper describes an online problem-based learning\napproach to the creation of a student-centred learning environment for the study of the\nbiological sciences subject in the Graduate Diploma of Applied Science (Medical\nUltrasonography) course at the University of Sydney. The environment is interactive and\ncollaborative, with all communication taking place online. Students work in groups to\nstudy clinically relevant problems. A Web-database system provides learner control in the\nprocess of knowledge acquisition, access to reference materials on the Internet and\ncommunication with the tutor and with peers through synchronous chat and\nasynchronous threaded discussion forums. Other online features include a protocol for\nproblem-solving, self-assessment and feedback opportunities, detailed help, streaming\naudio and video and pre-course, ongoing and post-course questionnaires. This technology\nmay be adapted to a range of disciplines and can also be utilized in on-campus teaching.\nIntroduction\nThere have been significant advances in the practice of sonography since the introduction\nof the University of Sydney course in 1991. The entire knowledge base can no longer be\ntaught within the constraints of time allotted to the subject. Moreover, encouraging\nstudents to be self-directed, independent learners is more important than ever, since the\nfield of sonography has reached a stage where there is an urgent need for new skills.\nIn addition, there has been a range of social and economic factors that have resulted in\nmajor changes in higher education and have contributed to the current educational climate\nso\nALT-J Volume 8 Number I\n(Campion, 1995; Edwards, 1995). These changes have challenged universities to introduce\nteaching and learning strategies that cater for different client groups using forms of\ndelivery that increase access to learning opportunities. In particular, there are demands for\nthe university sector to provide for a larger and more diverse cross-section of the\npopulation, to cater for emerging patterns of educational involvement which facilitate\nlifelong learning, and to include technology-based practices in the curriculum (Renner,\n1995).\nThese developments imply a student-centred approach to learning. Given the current\neconomic climate in higher education and the need to maintain pedagogically sound\npractices, there is the need to consider learning within a developmental framework\n(Laurilland, 1993) which has lifelong learning as a major outcome. The introduction of\nproblem-based learning (PBL) in the biological sciences subject of the Graduate Diploma\nof Health Science (Medical Sonography) at the University of Sydney in 1996 allowed\nstudents to be more independent with greater self-direction in their study programme. The\nsubject content and structure have changed to make them relevant to the needs of\nsonographers in a changing professional environment. Online delivery is seen as a way of\nproviding student-centred lifelong learning opportunities. The issue for those designing\nthese courses is how to provide more appropriate and flexible educational opportunities for\nthe learner, given that the importance of knowledge acquisition is the primary focus of the\neducational process.\nThis paper describes how technology was incorporated into the PBL approach in 1998 to\noffer enhanced learning capabilities, through the development of an innovative programme\ndelivered entirely in distance learning mode. The online programme ran for the first time in\n1999. It has attracted local, rural, interstate and New Zealand students. This accessibility\nhas increased the size of the market, as well as making the offering of courses overseas\nviable. At the same time it has accommodated the time limitations of the mature-age part-\ntime professionals of this course, without the need for simultaneous traditional university\ntraining.\nDesign\nThe multidisciplinary in-house team involved in the development of this programme over a\nperiod of six months spent 700 hours in the developmental stage of this programme at a\ncost of $A 22,400. The team consisted of an academic, the academic developer from the\nCentre for Teaching and Learning, an educational technologist and a Web developer. They\nhad the task of collectively providing a comprehensive view of specific subject knowledge,\nand a pedagogical awareness of the principles underlying optimal student learning and\ntechnical skills in Web design and development. The team was conscious that the learner,\nnot the technology, is central to the design, which, in turn, is based on sound educational\nprinciples (Godfrey, 1996). Standard Internet technology, MS SQL Server Database and\nCold Fusion software were used.\nThe team sought to embed the fostering of generic attributes and lifelong learning skills in\nthe program. As McAllister (1997) points out, the graduates of today are expected to be\n'beginning practitioners' who become 'critical consumers of information and lifelong\nlearners who maintain competence in their discipline, expand and test their own knowledge\n51\nL C. Minasian-Batmanian et a\\ Developing lifelong learners: a novel online problem-based uttrasonography subject\nand skills, and contribute to the expansion of knowledge in the field'. The goals of\nvocationally-based education have changed from focusing on training and instruction to\ninclude an emphasis on the development of generic attributes essential to professional\ncompetence and lifelong learning (Bates, 1997; Higher Education Council, 1992;\nKirkwood, 1998; Ramsden, 1992; Savery and Duffy, 1994). Engel (1995) summarized these\nas comprising the acquisition of:\n\u2022 discipline-specific knowledge and competencies;\n\u2022 generally applicable competencies, for example, ability to adapt to change and\nparticipate in change, communicate, collaborate in groups, and be self-directed lifelong\nlearners who can apply critical reasoning and a scientific approach to decision-making\nin unfamiliar situations.\nIn order to achieve these aims, designing and redesigning content and methodology for\nonline delivery was important, as was reconsidering previously accepted and often\nunquestioned practices.\nThe social aspect of learning present in traditional university-based education is often\nmissing, neglected or poorly considered. Online courses often rely on simply taking written\ntext or lecture notes and presenting them digitally. Students are expected to learn\nindependently by reference to the written or presentation materials the lecturer would\nnormally deliver in a classroom situation. This site, however, takes advantage of multi-\nmedia facilities to provide added value to distance learning. It combines the independence\nof distance learning with the social aspects of university-based learning. The site therefore\ncontains no lecture notes, but simply presents a text description of twelve case studies that\nthe students are required to engage with. Students work in groups of six, through the\nonline problem identification process (Protocol) to study the pathophysiological know-\nledge necessary to understand and solve these cases.\nThe biological sciences online environment has been designed for maximum flexibility. It\nallows students from a variety of backgrounds to construct a study plan according to their\ninterests, expertise and availability. An individual can opt to be delegated to research\ncertain objectives generated by the cases. Those with particular specialties are placed\ntogether to act as resource people for the whole online community. An online calendar was\nincorporated to assist students in scheduling their discussions. The flexible learning\napproach offers the student increased choice in what to learn (students devise their own\nobjectives); how it is learned (the learning style they choose to follow from the resources\nsupplied); and when and where learning happens (whether it is in a face-to-face situation,\nat the end of a telephone line as in teleconferencing, or online conferencing).\nWhen designing the flexible learning environment, care was taken to develop domain-\nspecific educational strategies. These include explanatory notes in the form of text\/audio\nhints (Figure 1) and streaming video (Figure 2), a flow chart to explain the step-by-step\nProtocol (Figure 3), exercises in the form of self-evaluative tests and a diagnostic exam,\nresources, assessment requirements and group discussion facility via chatspace and\ndiscussion forum.\nThe visual elements are carefully planned to take account of non-technical users. The\nvisual and navigational interface is designed for coherence, accessibility and clarity.

The graphics give the impression of ultrasound\nwithout making the medical emphasis of the site too obvious. The menu structure makes\nthe site very easy to navigate with the navigation bars remaining constant throughout.\nInformation is arranged in three different, colour-coded sections in the site, for easy\nidentification: pathology\/genetics (blue), self learning (purple) and groups (green).\nThe explanation to the students of the teaching and learning methods employed is clear\nand comprehensive and avoids the use of jargon. Assessment is clearly explained and the\ncourse provides a spread of relevant assessment. The chat space and discussion forum\nprovides students with the opportunity for collaborative learning online and self-tests assist\nstudents in monitoring their own progress. A series of evaluation questions provide\nfeedback to the facilitator on most aspects of the subject and its delivery.\nSelf-directed learning is a feature of both traditional distance learning and university-based\ncourses, but in distance learning it is sometimes almost the only pedagogic approach taken.\nOnline learning can take advantage of multimedia to make a wide store of information\navailable at the click of a button, giving all students equality of access. The use of hypertext\nwith direct and associative links gives flexibility to the students' approach to learning. It helps\nto orientate the student to independence and self-responsibility in learning, a basis for\nS3\nL C.

Alternatively the student can make detailed searches\nusing the same resources for specific information. There are also links from key words or\nphrases to specific and detailed information on particular aspects within the site.\nThe advantage of flexible delivery is that it includes learner control over content, time,\nplace and method of learning. Online course materials are specially designed for studying\nwhen and where the students choose. The students can phone, fax, mail, or email teaching\nstaff whenever they need help. Frequently asked questions regarding the educational\naspects of the site are answered online. A suggested timetable (Figure 4), recommended\nlength of discussions and a study schedule have been included to give participants an\nestimate of the time involved in this subject and the rate at which they can expect to\nprogress. To engage students in the learning process, a case Proforma was incorporated,\nwhich summarizes the steps in the Protocol to guide the students through the learning\nprocess. Although a comprehensive online help system is provided, a fifty-page User Site\nGuide is mailed to students before semester starts, to familiarize them with the learning\nenvironment and navigational features.\n54\nALT-J Volume 8 Number I\nPROBLEM IDENTIFICATION PROCESS\nfigure 3:7?ie Protocol flow chart\nTeaching and learning methodology\nof the teaching and\ns^biecf TW\u00b0fWlCdfC ^ S C C a n n O t b C t a U g h t W h h i n t h e constraints of time allotted to the\nProblem^n Z * \u00b0T ^ S p e d f l C a l l y c h \u00b0 S e n t o c o v e r t h e \u2122* commonly seenproblems in ultrasonography practice, or those that illustrate significant ri\nd L\n ? n i C a l P r \u00b0 b l e m S t h e m 0 S t C o m m o n f o \u2122 o f t ^ dq ^ p\nT!? r ^ thC informatiOn P r o v i d e d in hospitals h i\n\"\n P r O b i e ?

The site\nincludes discussion groups, forums, a chat space and facilitator\/student communication:\n\u2022 Discussion groups are designed for small groups of students to meet online and discuss\nthe case studies and to identify and work through the problems together. The small\ngroups are designed to create coherent units and a group identity. This means that\nindividuals are less likely to drop out of discussions or 'lurk' and fail to participate.\nStudents are given advice on the structure, behaviour and timing of group discussions.\nForums are designed to provide whole group discussion and interaction - an online\nreplacement for the university-based seminar.\n\u2022 There are three types of forum: (i) case studies for wider discussion of the problem,\n(ii) feedback where the students can discuss feedback given by the facilitator, and\n(iii) general discussion where students are able to raise any matters not necessarily\ndirectly related to the subject content.\n\u2022 The chat space provides an opportunity for students to talk in real time (anonymously\nif they prefer) and to post their own opinions, references and resource links.\n\u2022 Email, fax and phone communication with the facilitator are provided for support,\nfeedback and assessment.\n56\nALT-J Volume 8 Number I\nFeedback\nIn this online course, the lecturer becomes a facilitator of information (electronic, verbal,\netc.) by guiding, advising, commenting on progress and offering explanations, or adopting\nthe role of co-leamer. Students are encouraged to submit alternative information with\nwhich they may be familiar from their work situation or through their literature or Web\nsearches. This encourages the sense of interdependence and validates the knowledge that\nstudents bring to the learning situation.\nThe online learning environment provides the facilitator with a greater level of awareness\non the progress of individuals. In the biological sciences subject we tried to engage the first-\nyear students in a number of ways. Thirty-six students were enrolled in the subject. They\nwere given an optional face-to-face introductory meeting with academic staff before the\nstart of the course. Twelve students decided to learn in a face-to-face situation, twelve by\nonline conferencing alone and twelve using a combination of the two processes. The\nfacilitator was scheduled to attend the first four weeks of synchronous chat discussion\nforums, to assist students using the online environment with resolving immediate problems\nconcerning the Protocol.\nThe students were initially encouraged to interact with three students of the group of six to\nget to know one another before semester started. They exchanged information about\ninterests and hobbies on a personal level; their specialty at a professional level; and any\nother issues of common interest that they would like to share with the other students and\nthe facilitator. Online participant profiles, which are accessible and amenable to change,\nwere provided to personalize the design of the site (Pillay, Boles and Raj, 1998). This\nextracurricular activity was used as a focus to acquaint the students with their peers and to\nintroduce them to the new learning environment. This was found to be beneficial before\nstudents worked in groups on their clinical problems or case studies. The groups were\nprovided with guidance to help them devise criteria for working effectively as a team. This\nreflects the skills they will require in their future professional and social lives. The\nproportions of both peer and facilitator support have been increased to four hours per\nweek from the normal rate of two hours per week. This is intended to overcome feelings of\nisolation and to allow for the fact that learning and motivation are significantly improved\nfor distance-learning participants by increased communication and feedback. The\nfacilitator was always on duty to respond to email, fax or phone, although in the future this\nwill be restricted to certain hours in the week.\nAssessment\nThe online subject features both formative and summative assessment. Formative\nassessment is provided through a series of self-evaluative tests at various stages in the\ncourse and a diagnostic mock examination. Self-tests enable the students to monitor their\nown progress in a non-threatening situation and thereby take control of their own learning.\nThe use of formative assessment through questionnaires or short-answer questions means\nstudents are able to test their own ideas against 'expert' opinions. These tests are also useful\nin assisting students in the identification of learning goals and areas of difficulty and\nprovide a means of reflecting on their on-going progress. Other formative assessment\ncomes from peer group discussion and feedback from the facilitator.\n57\nL C. Minasian-Batmanian et pi Developing lifelong learners: a novel online problem-based ultrasonography subject\nSummative assessment emphasizes the importance of collaborative learning, with a\nproportion of the marks based on contribution to group work (5 per cent), as well as ten\nreports submitted by the group (40 per cent). Individual assessment (28 per cent) is based\non an end examination comprising multiple-choice and short essay questions. Students are\nprovided with additional scaffolding in the first clinical problem, which is presented as a\nworked example and hints are provided to help solve case history two, giving an example of\nthe scope, focus and level of work required for the assessed cases.\nEvaluation\nStaff at the University of Teesside, UK, evaluated the biological sciences subject. The\nevaluation was based on an examination of the features that contribute to the PBL\napproach as well as visual, content and navigational design elements. After evaluation, the\nsubject was presented to the students as an example of best practice in online learning. The\nresults of the evaluation have been incorporated into this paper.\nThis online environment enables integration and co-ordination of theoretical and clinical\nmaterial, as well as encouraging the development of skills in logical reasoning, critical\nthinking, communication and self-directed learning (Grabinger, Dunlap and Duffield,\n1997). Biggs (1989) found that teaching that gave evidence of deep learning contained one\nor more of the following: an appropriate motivational context; a high degree of learner\nactivity; interaction with others, both peers and teachers; and a well structured knowledge\nbase. The students were highly motivated through the direct link between the cases and the\ndemands of the subject and its assessment. There was a high degree of learner activity with\nbrainstorming, role-play and feedback (Moore, 1993). Students had to interact constantly\nwith their peers and facilitators. We believe that the programme described in this paper has\nled to deep learning, as evidenced by their results of 94 per cent graded passes this year, as\ncompared with 84 per cent last year. Although evaluation of student responses is yet to be\nfully analysed, preliminary feedback has been most favourable. Some representative\ncomments included:\n'The best aspect of the subject was the problem-based learning approach.'\n'The tie-together of pathology and its effect on the patient and what we should expect\nto observe with ultrasound made the subject relevant.'\n'Diagnosing the case studies was interesting. It was good to be in groups as we got to\nknow other people in more depth.'\n'Links were very helpful even now after bioscience has finished.'\n'My skills in written communication as well as the use of technology was greatly\nimproved.'\nDiscussion\nConsistent with the philosophy of critical and reflective practice, we have attempted to\naccommodate the attributes of lifelong learning and critical reasoning skills development,\ndescribed by Candy (1994), to the study of ultrasonography. The cases require that the\nstudents:\n58\nALT-J Volume 8 Number I\n\u2022 ask questions of the facilitator and of each other to determine objectives, undertake\ncritical appraisal of the relevant literature, and self-evaluation of understanding;\n\u2022 are aware of the interrelationships between theoretical and applied knowledge and\nacquire an understanding of ultrasound procedural limitations;\n\u2022 develop a knowledge of current resources, frame researchable questions, locate,\nevaluate, manage and use information in a range of contexts, retrieve information using\na variety of media, including Web links, videos, literature searches; decode information\nin a variety of written and graphical forms; and critically evaluate information to be\nsubmitted in the report;\n\u2022 are capable of working on their own, interact within a team, and develop self\norganizational skills as well as an appreciation for multiple perspectives;\n\u2022 acquire a variety of learning skills, an awareness of their own personal strengths,\nweaknesses and preferred learning style; develop different strategies for learning\naccording to context and understand the differences between surface and deep\nlearning.\nConclusion\nThis paper has shown that technology can assist in the adoption of a more student-centred\napproach to teaching and learning in which students develop knowledge, skills and\nresources that can assist them to a stage of 'learning by discovery', through a process of\ndiscussion, discovery, interaction, adaptation and reflection. It has the advantages of\nproviding increased accessibility, immediate feedback, interactive learning and a more\nflexible environment. It provides both peer and tutor support and guidance, as well as a\nwealth of resources. The subject encourages active learning, without leaving the student\nawash in a sea of information, by providing guidance on how to begin addressing the\nproblems introduced in the case studies. It provides a complete environment from\nintroduction to assessment and evaluation.\nAnother advantage of this site for the courseware developer is that the format adopted is\neasily transferable to a different subject and course, making reuse a practical proposition\nand thereby cutting down on future development. The template is currently being adapted\nto accommodate for the design and development of a postgraduate subject in Management\nin the School of Health Information Management, Faculty of Health Sciences, University\nof Sydney. Moreover, active interest has been expressed for use in undergraduate courses\nrun by the Department of Biological Sciences and continuing education courses run by the\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, at the University. The site has been adopted\nby the University of Teesside as an example of good practice in teaching courseware design\nat masters degree level.\nAcknowledgements\nLaura Batmanian wishes to thank Steve Clark and Andrew Lovell-Simons for their\nassistance in designing and developing the site; Jason Bayly for Web design, programming\nand co-ordination; and Angus Denton for the productions of the streaming video and\naudio hints.\n59\nL C.
