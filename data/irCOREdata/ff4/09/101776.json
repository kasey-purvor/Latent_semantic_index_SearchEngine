It is envisaged that \nthis technique could be scaled up as an industrial \nprocess for producing truly large area, transparent \nand cheap FE substrates. \nExperimental \nAqueous dispersions of o-MWNT are frequently \nformed by refluxing nanotubes in a concentrated \nnitric and sulphuric acid mixture, resulting in the \nformation of oxygen containing moieties including \ncarboxylic acid groups attached to the nanotube \nends and sidewalls. These groups interact with \nwater molecules via hydrogen bonding. Acid \ntreatment also serves to purify nanotubes, \nremoving catalytic particles and amorphous \ncarbon. This method was used to produce an o-\nMWNT ink with a loading of 3.5 mg\/ml. The ink \nwas spin-coated onto carefully cleaned, oxygen \nplasma treated ITO-coated glass substrates and \nbaked to remove residual water. The sample was \nexposed to single 25 ns pulses from a 248 nm \npulsed UV eximer laser over a range of energies. \nEach irradiation was repeated at six different sites. \nThe area of the laser spot was 0.134 cm2. \nResults \nSEM images are shown in Figure 1. Figure 1(a) is \nan as-spun o-MWNT layer on ITO coated glass. \nThis layer is homogeneous across an area of 2.5 x \n2.5 cm2, except at the very edges. Figures 1(b) - \n1(f) show the effects of laser irradiation with \nfluences 149, 186, 223, 298 and 335 mJ\/cm2, \nrespectively. In Figure 1(b), cracks can be seen in \nthe ITO layer, due to strong absorption of UV by \nITO. The o-MWNT layer appears thinner than the \noriginal layer, suggesting that some of the o-\nMWNTs have been destroyed or removed by the \nlaser pulse. Figure 1(c) and 1(d) show wider \ncracks in the ITO layer and more damage to the o-\nMWNT layer. In Figure 1(e) all the o-MWNTs \nhave been entirely removed or destroyed by the \nlaser pulse. The ITO layer has been partially \ndestroyed and ejected from the surface in large \nchunks, some of which can be seen at the edges of \nthe picture. Figure (f) taken after the highest laser \nfluence pulse shows that the ITO layer has melted \ndue to the large quantity of energy absorbed. \n \nFig. 1: SEM images of the substrates after irradiation with \nfluences 0, 149, 186, 223, 298 and 335 mJ\/cm2, respectively. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1-4244-0633-1\/07\/$20.00@ 2007 IEEE \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

The threshold field (Eth) was defined as the \nmacroscopic electric field at which 1nA was \ndetected. Figure 2(a) shows Eth and the \nenhancement factor (\u03b2), plotted versus laser \nfluence. Eth ranged from 6.2 V\/\u00b5m (at 186 \nmJ\/cm2), to 17.8 V\/\u00b5m for untreated o-MWNT. \nAs the laser fluence increases, Eth improves and \u03b2 \nincreases. This is due to the o-MWNT laying flat \nand close together on the untreated substrate, \nleading to screening and therefore, low \u03b2. As laser \nfluence increases, some o-MWNT are removed \nfrom the substrate and others may be partially \nlifted from the substrate surface. This reduces \nscreening effects and increases \u03b2. As the laser \nfluence increases further, Eth deteriorates and \u03b2 is \nreduced. This is due to the removal of o-MWNT \nfrom the ITO substrate by the laser irradiation \nprocess resulting in FE from fewer sites and on \naverage a much smoother surface. At even higher \nlaser fluences, the incident energy is sufficient to \nat first partially remove and then melt the ITO \nlayer. FE from the edges of the remaining ITO \nportions and the metallic islands of the melted \nITO layer result in a lower Eth and a higher \u03b2 than \nthe original untreated o-MWNT layer. \nFig. 2: (a) Plot of Eth and \u03b2 vs. fluence (b) Transmission at \ndifferent fluences and T (measured at 550 nm) versus fluence. \nTransmission (T) spectra (Fig. 2(b)) of the films \nwere measured on a dual-beam spectrophotometer \nusing clean ITO-coated glass as a control. At low \nlaser intensities, T varies slowly as a function of \nlaser fluence. It would be expected that T would \nincrease as o-MWNT are destroyed or removed \nfrom the surface. However the surface damage to \nthe ITO layer, visible as cracks in the SEM images \nleads to scattering and absorption of incident light \nby the sample and therefore a small reduction in T \nis observed. At the optimum laser fluence for FE \n(186 mJ\/cm2), T is at 98% that of the untreated o-\nMWNT layer. At higher laser fluences, T rapidly \ndeteriorates as the ITO surface is modified by the \nincident laser energy and large surface features \nincrease the amount of scattering from the sample. \nConclusion \nFlat layers of o-MWNT were spin coated onto \nITO-coated glass substrates. This transparent o-\nMWNT layer was subjected to a single pulse from \na UV laser at a range of energies. The resulting \nsubstrates were subjected to FE characterisation \nand Eth was measured as 6.2 V\/\u00b5m for fluence 186 \nmJ\/cm2. Emission improved with increasing laser \nfluence, before eventually deteriorating at the \nhighest fluences, as the o-MWNT were removed \nand the underlying ITO substrate deteriorated. At \nlower laser fluences the transmission of light \nthrough the substrate remained high, whereas at \nhigher laser fluences the transmission was \ndramatically reduced. \nWe would like to thank EPSRC (UK) for funding \nthis research via the CBE and Portfolio \nPartnership programmes. \nReferences \n1.
