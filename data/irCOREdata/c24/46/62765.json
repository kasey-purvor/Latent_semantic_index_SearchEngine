Geosyst., 8, Q06012, doi:10.1029\/2006GC001535.\n1. Introduction\n[2] Diatom silica represents an important and in-\ncreasingly viable option for obtaining isotope\nrecords from the numerous lacustrine and marine\nsites devoid of carbonates. Many studies have\ndemonstrated the potential for d18Odiatom in paleo-\nenvironmental reconstructions, both as a stand-\nalone technique (see Leng and Barker [2006] for\na review) and alongside carbonate isotope records\n[Shemesh et al., 1992; Leng et al., 2001; Lamb et\nal., 2005; Swann et al., 2006]. Further work has\nalso clarified that the diatom-temperature coeffi-\ncient most likely lies at approximately \u00010.2%\/\u0001C\n[Brandriss et al., 1998; Moschen et al., 2005]\nrather than the higher values proposed in earlier\nstudies [Shemesh et al., 1992; Juillet-Leclerc and\nLabeyrie, 1987].\n[3] Despite recent advances, there remain a num-\nber of uncertainties over the use of d18Odiatom for\npaleoenvironmental reconstructions. One is the\npotential for isotope exchange during burial and\nearly diagenesis, which may act to remove much of\nthe surface water paleoenvironmental isotope sig-\nnal [Shemesh et al., 1992; Schmidt et al., 1997,\n2001; Moschen et al., 2006]. Second is the possi-\nbility for interspecies and intraspecies offsets in\nd18Odiatom. Diatoms are assumed to precipitate in\nisotope equilibrium. However, many biological\norganisms display significant isotope deviations\nfrom isotope equilibrium. These so-called vital\neffects have been attributed to a range of processes\nincluding variations in the micro-environment, in-\ncorporation of metabolic fluids, vertical migration\nin the water column, changes in pH and changes in\nthe rate of precipitation [Leng and Marshall,\n2004]. In freshwater ostracods these effects can\nrange from 0.3\u20132.5% for d18O [Xia et al., 1997;\nvon Grafenstein et al., 1999; Chivas et al., 2002;\nHolmes and Chivas, 2002]. Within marine organ-\nisms, vital effects have been most widely studied in\nforaminifera with d18O variations of up to 6%\nbeing documented [Duplessy et al., 1970; Wefer\nand Berger, 1991; Spero and Lea, 1993, 1996;\nSpero et al., 1997; Bemis et al., 1998].\n[4] To date, a range of culture experiments [Binz,\n1987; Schmidt et al., 2001] and down-core studies\n[Juillet-Leclerc and Labeyrie, 1987; Shemesh et\nal., 1995; Swann et al., 2006] have found little or\nno evidence to indicate that vital or other species\neffects exist in diatoms. In particular, Moschen et\nal. [2005] found no isotope offset between three\nsize fractions of diatoms collected from Lake\nHolzmaar, Germany. While the data of Brandriss\net al. [1998] do indicate a 0.6% difference between\ntwo laboratory cultured species and while Shemesh\net al. [1995] found a 0.2% offset between two size\nfractions of diatoms, such offsets are within the\nrange of reproducibility routinely achieved using\nfluorination based techniques. As such, interspe-\ncies and intraspecies offsets in d18Odiatom have\nhitherto been regarded to be either nonexistent or\nwithin analytical reproducibility. However, this\nassumption is currently based on a limited data\nset, highlighting the need for further investigation.\nThis is important since, in contrast to biogenic\ncarbonates such as ostracods and foraminifera,\nsingle species diatom valves cannot easily be\npicked out to create mono-specific species samples\ndue to their smaller size. While in some instances it\nhas proven possible to isolate different sized taxa\nusing SPLITT [see Rings et al., 2004] or by sieving\nat different size fractions [Swann et al., 2006], in\nthe majority of cases d18Odiatom data are derived\nfrom samples composed of multiple species.\n[5] Here we reexamine the issue of interspecies\nand intraspecies offsets in d18Odiatom using sedi-\nment core material from ODP site 882, a site at\nwhich it has previously proven possible to separate\ndifferent sized taxa. Previous comparisons made at\nonly three levels between 2.83 Ma and 2.73 Ma\nsuggested the absence of d18Odiatom vital or species\neffects at this site [Swann et al., 2006]. Further\nextraction of an additional 22 pure diatom samples\nwhich are dominated by only two taxa, however,\nshow that there is a mean offset of 1.23% between\nthe two size fractions (75\u2013150 mm and >150 mm).\n2. Methodology\n[6] Sediment samples corresponding to the onset\nof major Northern Hemisphere Glaciation (NHG),\n2.84-2.57 Ma (MIS 116 (G12)\u2013102) were collected\nfrom the northwest Pacific Ocean at Ocean Drilling\nProject (ODP) site 882, situated on the western\nsection of the Detroit Seamounts (50\u0001220N,\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 swann et al.: diatom oxygen isotopes 10.1029\/2006GC001535\n2 of 10\n167\u0001360E) at a water depth of 3,244 m (Figure 1)\n[Rea et al., 1995]. High resolution GRAPE density\nand magnetic susceptibility measurements were\nastronomical calibrated with linear interpolation of\nsedimentation rates between tie-points to calculate\nsample ages [Tiedemann and Haug, 1995]. Samples\nfor d18Odiatom were prepared using the three-stage\nmethodology detailed by Swann et al. [2006] with\nmaterial sieved at 75 mm and 150 mm and both size\nfractions (75\u2013150 mm and >150 mm) retained for\nisotope analysis. Visual inspection of the diatom\nflora prior to this stage showed these size fractions\nas being optimal to minimize diatom species diver-\nsity. Subsamples of the final purified material were\nmounted on a coverslip using a Naphrax\n1\nmounting\nmedia and visually checked for contamination under\na light microscope at \u00031000 magnification using\nthirty randomly selected quadrants on a 100 mm \u0003\n100 mm grid graticule with further SEM analyses\nundertaken to ensure diatom purity. Random quad-\nrants were selected in such a way that the whole\ncoverslip was sampled, including the edge of the\ncoverslip where more contamination may be pres-\nent. All samples containing more than a few percent\nof nondiatom material were disregarded for isotope\nanalysis.\n[7] Diatoms were analyzed for oxygen isotopes\nusing a stepwise fluorination method to dissociate\nthe silica and liberate the oxygen [Leng and\nBarker, 2006]. In brief, the diatom hydrous layers\nwere stripped during a prefluorination outgassing\nstage in nickel reaction tubes using a stoichiometric\ndeficiency of BrF5 reagent at low temperature\nbefore full reaction with an excess of reagent at\nhigh temperature. Oxygen was converted to CO2\nfollowing the methodology of Clayton and Mayeda\n[1963] with d18Odiatom measured on an Optima dual\ninlet mass spectrometer. d18Odiatom values were\nconverted to the SMOW scale using a within-run\nlaboratory standard (BFCmod) calibrated against\nNBS28. Diatom species biovolumes were calcu-\nlated following the recommendations ofHillebrand\net al. [1999] on the final purified unreacted sample\nwith the assumption that relative hydroxyl layer\nthicknesses were constant across all diatoms. While\nmeasurements of diatom biovolume record the vol-\nume rather than the mass of diatoms, the values\nremain a valuable tool for identifying the relative\ncontribution of individual diatom species to an\nisotope measurement.\n[8] While the range of the size fractions analyzed\nfor d18Odiatom would ideally have been reduced to\ncreate more sieve bins, e.g., 75\u2013100 mm, 100\u2013\n125 mm, 125\u2013150 mm and 150\u2013175 mm, this was\nnot possible due to the necessity of extracting\nsufficient material for isotope analysis (5 mg).\nSmaller size fractions, e.g., 10\u201338 mm and 38\u2013\n75 mm, were not suitable for isotope analysis due\nto the increased numbers of diatom species in these\nsamples, which also bloom across different sea-\nsons, and due to the multiple fragments of larger\nC. radiatus and C. marginatus diatom frustules that\nwere present in these samples.\n3. Results\n[9] All diatoms within the analyzed samples ap-\npear pristine and do not appear to have undergone\nany diagenesis (Figure 2). In addition, levels of\nnondiatom contamination in both size fractions are\nminimal (Figure 3a). Sample biovolumes for the\n>150 mm fraction are dominated by Coscinodiscus\nmarginatus (Ehrenb.) and Coscinodiscus radiatus\n(Ehrenb.), which are approximately equally distrib-\nuted throughout with neither contributing more\nthan 65% of any sample biovolume (Figure 3b).\nBiovolumes in the 75\u2013150 mm fraction are domi-\nnated solely byC. radiatus until 2.69Ma after which\nC. marginatus becomes dominant (Figure 3b).\nFigure 1. Location of ODP site 882 (50\u0001220N, 167\u0001360E) northwest Pacific Ocean together with diatom monitoring\nstation 50N (50.01\u0001N, 165.01\u0001E) and major ocean surface currents in the North Pacific Ocean.\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 swann et al.: diatom oxygen isotopes 10.1029\/2006GC001535\n3 of 10\n[10] Comparisons indicate the presence of large\nd18Odiatom offsets between the two size fractions\nwith a mean offset of 1.23% and a maximum offset\nof 3.51% (Figures 3c and 4 and Table 1). Replicate\nanalyses indicate a mean d18Odiatom standard devi-\nation of 0.44% in the 75\u2013150 mm fraction, 0.71%\nin the >150 mm fraction and 0.41% for BFCmod,\nthe NIGL laboratory diatom standard. Of the 25\nanalyzed levels, including the three samples previ-\nously published by Swann et al. [2006], 18 contain\noffsets which are beyond the combined square root\nsum of squares analytical reproducibility for the\ntwo size fractions (0.84%). With the exception of\nthree levels, the smaller 75\u2013150 mm fraction has a\nhigher d18Odiatom relative to the >150 mm fraction\n(p < 0.001). After the onset of major Northern\nHemisphere Glaciation (NHG) at 2.73 Ma when\nthe region undergoes major paleoenvironmental\nchange [Haug et al., 2005; Swann et al., 2006],\nd18Odiatom values in 75\u2013150 mm fraction remain\nstatistically higher than the >150 mm fraction, but\nat a lower confidence interval (p = 0.08).\n4. Discussion\n4.1. Reliability of the d18O(diatom)Record\n[11] d18Odiatom measurements from the 75\u2013150 mm\nfraction have previously been used to indicate the\ndevelopment of a stratified water column in the\nnorthwest Pacific Ocean at the onset of major\nNHG, circa 2.73 Ma [Haug et al., 2005; Swann\net al., 2006]. While measurements between the two\nsize fractions at three levels from 2.83 Ma to\n2.73 Ma produced similar results within the limits\nof analytical reproducibility [Swann et al., 2006],\n18 out of 25 levels in the extended data set presented\nFigure 2. SEM images of diatoms analyzed for d18O\nfrom ODP site 882.\nFigure 3. (a) Sample purity, percentage of diatom material relative to all other material. (b) Relative diatom species\nbiovolume in purified samples analyzed for d18Odiatom. (c) Comparison of d\n18Odiatom measurements from the 75\u2013\n150 mm fraction (red down triangle) and >150 mm fraction (blue up triangle) between 2.86 Ma and 2.56 Ma. Error bars\nrepresent mean, 1s, analytical reproducibility of 0.44% in the 75\u2013150 mm fraction and 0.71% in the >150 mm fraction.\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 swann et al.: diatom oxygen isotopes 10.1029\/2006GC001535\n4 of 10\nhere display significant offsets beyond the com-\nbined analytical reproducibility for the two size\nfractions of 0.84%.\n[12] As detailed above, all analyzed diatom samples\nare considered pristine with minimal nondiatom\ncontamination and dissolution (Figures 2 and 3a).\nFurthermore, no evidence of diagenesis exists\neither within the sediment or the analyzed diatoms.\nEvidence to support the lack of contamination in\nthese samples is present within the d18Odiatom data\nthemselves. First, high d18Odiatom values in all\nsamples makes it unlikely that contamination is\nan issue since the d18O of clays and silts are usually\nsignificantly lower than d18Odiatom, although no\nclay isotope values are available from ODP site\n882 over the analyzed interval. Secondly, it would\nbe expected that if contamination was an issue, the\nrelative amount of any contamination, particularly\nfrom clays, would be greater in the 75\u2013150 mm\nfraction due to the fraction\u2019s smaller size. This\nwould then lead to d18Odiatom values in the 75\u2013\n150 mm fraction being lower than the >150 mm\nfraction. In practice, the 75\u2013150 mm fraction dis-\nplays higher d18Odiatom values in almost all samples\n(Figures 3c and 4).\n[13] An important finding in recent years is evi-\ndence for secondary isotope exchange in diatoms,\ncaused by silica maturation, which increases fossil\/\nsubfossil values of d18Odiatom relative to diatoms in\nthe water column [Schmidt et al., 1997, 2001;\nBrandriss et al., 1998; Moschen et al., 2006].\nChecking for silica maturation in diatoms is diffi-\ncult as it does not always visibly alter the diatom\nfrustule and so cannot be assessed under a light\nmicroscope or SEM. However, the role of silica\nmaturation on d18Odiatom at this site and over this\ninterval has previously been ruled out by comparing\nchanges in d18Odiatom to changes in bottom water\nd18O, as indicated by benthic foraminifera [Swann\net al., 2006]. In addition, it would be expected that\nany secondary isotope exchange caused by silica\nmaturation would be constant across both size\nFigure 4. Relative diatom species biovolume in purified samples analyzed for d18Odiatom alongside the magnitude\nand direction of the d18Odiatom offsets (>150 mm fraction minus 75\u2013150 mm fraction) between the two size fractions\n(dashed lines represent the combined analytical reproducibility of 0.84% for the two size fractions).\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 swann et al.: diatom oxygen isotopes 10.1029\/2006GC001535\n5 of 10\nfractions. As such, silica maturation should not be\nthe cause of the isotope offsets observed here.\n4.2. Seasonality\/Temporal Effect\n[14] Details on the spatial and temporal distribution\nof C. marginatus and C. radiatus at station 50N in\nthe northwest Pacific Ocean, situated close to ODP\nsite 882 (see Figure 1), are described by Onodera\net al. [2005]. This, together with other studies on\nC. marginatus and C. radiatus in the North Pacific,\nshows that peak fluxes of these taxa occur in\nautumn\/winter [Takahashi, 1986; Takahashi et\nal., 1996]. Counts also show the relative seasonal\nflux of C. marginatus and C. radiatus frustules in\nthe 75\u2013150 mm range to be similar through the\nyear (Table 2). No data are available on the\ntemporal flux of >150 mm frustules, due to their\nnear complete absence in the samples collected at\nstation 50N by Onodera et al. [2005] and due to a\nlack of other studies investigating the temporal and\necological characteristics of very large frustules for\nthese taxa. However, since all available evidence\nfrom the North Pacific Ocean shows peak fluxes of\nthese taxa during autumn\/winter, it is reasonable to\nassume that similar patterns also occur for >150 mm\nsized frustules. Consequently, it is unlikely that the\nisotope offsets are related to different taxa or differ-\nent sized diatoms growing in different seasons.\n[15] Given that each sample represents on average\nan approximately 2000\u20133000 year interval, it is\npossible that different conditions within the time\ninterval covered by each sample may have favored\ndifferent sized diatoms. For example, diatoms from\nthe 75\u2013150 mm fraction may have predominantly\noriginated from periods of higher salinity\/lower\ntemperatures and diatoms in the >150 mm fraction\nfrom periods of lower salinity\/higher temperatures.\nHowever, even if this occurred, it is hard to\nenvisage that environmental conditions could have\nvaried sufficiently at ODP site 882 to explain the\nentire magnitude of these offsets. Assuming a\ndiatom-temperature coefficient of approximately\n\u00010.2%\/\u0001C, for which increasing evidence exists is\nthe true diatom-temperature coefficient [Brandriss\net al., 1998;Moschen et al., 2005], the mean isotope\noffset between the two size fractions of 1.23%\nbecomes equivalent to a Sea Surface Temperatures\n(SST) change of 6.15\u0001Cwith the maximum offset of\n3.51% equivalent to a change of 17.55\u0001C.

Despite this, 11 out of\n14 samples from this period display a d18Odiatom\noffset beyond the combined analytical reproducibil-\nity with a mean offset of 1.5% (Figures 3 and 4).\n4.3. Evidence of an Interspecies Effect in\nd18Odiatom\n[16] Given the existence of only two dominant taxa\nwithin the analyzed samples, the d18Odiatom offsets\ncould reflect an interspecies effect between\nC. marginatus and C. radiatus. Visual compar-\nisons, however, only provide evidence for a weak,\nlargely unclear, relationship between the offsets\nand differences in diatom species biovolumes\nbetween the two fractions (Figure 4). From\n2.86 Ma to 2.74 Ma, when biovolumes in the\n75\u2013150 mm fraction contain >90% C. marginatus,\nincreases in C. marginatus\/C. radiatus in the\n>150 mm fraction are broadly associated with\nhigher\/lower d18Odiatom offsets between the two\nsize fractions (r = +0.49 and \u00010.49, respectively)\n(Figure 4). However, from 2.69 Ma onward, when\nbiovolumes in the >150 mm fraction are constant\nand biovolumes vary in the 75\u2013150 mm fraction,\nthe relationship reverses with increases in\nC. marginatus\/C. radiatus in the 75\u2013150 mm\nfraction associated with lower\/higher d18Odiatom\noffsets (r = \u00010.53 and +0.46, respectively).\n4.4. Evidence of a Size Effect in\nd18Odiatom\n[17] With all but one of the significant offsets\nmarked by higher d18Odiatom measurements in the\nsmaller 75\u2013150 mm fraction, it is possible that the\noffsets reflect a size related species effect. Deter-\nmining the processes which might cause a size\neffect, however, are not straightforward and can\nonly be truly investigated through culturing experi-\nments in addition to diatom monitoring and sedi-\nment core top studies. Within foraminifera, size\nrelated vital effects arise from their vertical migra-\ntion in the water column at different stages in their\nlife cycle [Sautter and Thunell, 1991]. This is\nunlikely to be an issue for diatoms which primarily\nbloom and take up oxygen into the inner tetrahe-\ndrally bonded -Si-O-Si layer within the photic\nzone. Evidence from the modern North Pacific\nOcean suggests all diatoms except Thalassiosira\ntrifulta and Thalassiosira gravida bloom within the\nupper 50 m of the water column [Katsuki and\nTakahashi, 2005]. Water column profiles from\nclose to ODP site 882 show salinity gradient\nthrough the year in the upper 50 m of the water\ncolumn to be 0.2 psu [Boyer et al., 2002]. As such,\nany salinity effect on the d18Odiatom offsets would\nbe minimal and within the analytical reproducibil-\nity of the d18Odiatom measurements. Water temper-\nature profiles from the same site also show the\ngradient between the surface and 50 m to be\nnegligible, less than 1\u0001C, through most of the year\n[Stephens et al., 2002]. Consequently, if modern-\nday SST and diatom growth patterns are used as an\nanalogue for the past, differences in diatom depth\nhabitats for different sized frustules could only\nresult in an offset of \u00040.1% when using a dia-\ntom-temperature coefficient of \u00010.2%\/\u0001C. Al-\nthough the temperature gradient increases to 5\u2013\n6\u0001C between July and September [Stephens et al.,\n2002], the blooms of C. marginatus and C. radi-\natus over this interval account for only 19.4% and\n29.0% of the total annual diatom flux [Onodera et\nal., 2005] or 13.1% and 6.2% of the 75\u2013150 mm\nfraction annual diatom flux, respectively (Table 2).\nIt is also likely that the majority of frustules bloom\nnearer the surface where light penetration is higher\nand where differences in the temperature gradient\nare further reduced. While a proportion of the\noffsets could be explained if all 75\u2013150 mm\ndiatoms bloomed in spring and all >150 mm\ndiatoms bloomed in autumn, this appears unlikely\nin light of the aforementioned contemporary stud-\nies showing peak fluxes of C. marginatus and\nC. radiatus in autumn\/early winter (Table 2)\n[Takahashi, 1986; Takahashi et al., 1996; Onodera\net al., 2005]. Furthermore, 19 out of the 25 levels\noriginate prior to the development of the halocline\nin the region at 2.73 Ma when the seasonal SST\ngradient would have been significantly reduced\nrelative to today [Haug et al., 1999, 2005].\n[18] Schmidt et al. [2001] have previously sug-\ngested that d18Odiatom may be partially governed by\ndiatom growth rates with less isotope fractionation\noccurring in fast-growing diatoms. Today, much of\nthe northwest Pacific Ocean is believed to be under\nFe limitation with respect to diatom growth\n[Harrison et al., 1999; Tsuda et al., 2003; Yuan\nand Zhang, 2006]. Consequently, changes in Fe\ndeposition, particularly variations in line with\nglacial (high Fe aeolian deposition) and intergla-\ncial (low Fe aeolian deposition) cycles, and the\nsubsequent impact on diatom growth rates and\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 swann et al.: diatom oxygen isotopes 10.1029\/2006GC001535\n7 of 10\ncell chemistry (see review by de Baar et al.\n[2005]) may be initiating the offsets. However,\nno relationship is apparent between glacial and\ninterglacial intervals, as indicated by a global\nstacked benthic foraminifera d18O record\n[Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005], and the magnitude\nof the d18Odiatom offsets.\n[19] The availability of nutrients such as N, Si and\nP may be important in explaining the offsets after\ncirca 2.73 Ma following the development of a\nstratified system in the region, which significantly\nlimited deep water delivery of nutrients into the\nphotic zone and lowered opal accumulation rates\nwithin the sediment [Haug et al., 1999, 2005]. For\nexample, the extent to which d18Odiatom in the 75\u2013\n150 mm fraction is significantly higher than the\n>150 mm fraction decreases at this juncture (p =\n0.08 compared to p < 0.001 prior to 2.73 Ma). In\naddition, the transition from C. marginatus being\nassociated with larger to smaller d18Odiatom offset\n(see section 4.3) also occurs over this interval.\nHowever, N, Si, and P are unlikely to be significant\nin explaining the offsets prior to circa 2.73 Ma (a\nperiod including 19 of the 25 analyzed levels)\nwhen a mixed water column was marked by\nextremely high opal accumulation rates and high\nnutrient availability [Haug et al., 1999, 2005]. It is\nalso unclear whether issues of diatom growth rates\nand nutrient availability are relevant issues for\nexplaining the isotope offsets since the effects of\ngrowth rates\/nutrient availability would presum-\nably be constant across all diatoms, regardless of\nsize, at a given level. However, it is possible that\nthe growth effect identified by Schmidt et al.\n[2001] influences larger diatoms to a greater extent\nthan smaller diatoms.\n4.5. Future Work\n[20] Above, we have exhausted many of the\npossible mechanisms which have the potential to\nexplain the large d18Odiatom offsets between the\ntwo size fractions. Due to the uncertainties which\ncurrently exist with regards to the fractionation of\noxygen by diatoms, we will not speculate further\nas to the processes which may be causing the\noffsets. Given that all but one of the levels are\nmarked by higher values in the smaller 75\u2013\n150 mm fraction, a size related species effect\nmay be present. However, on the basis of the\navailable data no one mechanism can be confi-\ndently attributed to explain the entire magnitude\nof the offsets. From the above, a clear need exists\nfor further sediment trap, core top and culture\nstudies on d18Odiatom. Such work on both marine\nand freshwater diatoms should consider the inter-\nspecies and intraspecies variations in d18Odiatom\nthat might arise following changes in diatom\ngrowth rates, cell chemistry, deep water upwell-\ning, nutrient availability and other physiological\nand environmental conditions.\n[21] In section 4.1 the role of silica maturation was\ndiscounted as a factor in explaining the isotope\noffsets on the basis of evidence from Swann et al.\n[2006] and by assuming that the magnitude of any\nsilica maturation would be constant across both\nsize fractions at a given level. Theoretically, how-\never, it is conceivable that the d18Odiatom offsets\nmay reflect a size related difference in the extent to\nwhich silica maturation occurs in diatoms with\ngreater silica maturation occurring in the smaller\n75\u2013150 mm fraction. At present, though, no evi-\ndence exists to indicate that interspecies and intra-\nspecies variations exist in the magnitude of isotope\nexchange during silica maturation. Consequently,\non the basis of current scientific knowledge, issues\nof silica maturation cannot be attributed to explain\nthe d18Odiatom offsets presented within this paper.\nHowever, given the uncertainties that currently\nexist with regards to the operation of silica matu-\nration in diatoms, experiments are required to\nbetter understand silica maturation and to investi-\ngate possible variations in silica maturation be-\ntween and within individual diatom taxa.\n4.6. Impact on Existing Paleoceanographic\nReconstructions\n[22] It is important to note that the offsets pre-\nsented here do not affect the reliability of the\npaleoenvironmental reconstructions of Haug et al.\n[2005] and Swann et al. [2006] with regards to\nthe development of a halocline in the region from\n2.73 Ma. First, these paleoenvironmental interpre-\ntations were based upon, among other lines of\nevidence, a 4.6% decrease in d18Odiatom which is\nsignificantly greater than any of the offsets observed\nhere. In addition the d18Odiatom record in these\nstudies is generated solely from the 75\u2013150 mm\nfraction, minimizing any potential size or other\nspecies effect. While the 75\u2013150 mm fraction is\nmarked by a shift in diatom species biovolume from\nC. marginatus to C. radiatus [see Swann et al.,\n2006, Figure 4b] this change occurs much later at\n2.71Ma (102.66 meters below seafloor (mbsf)) than\nthe 4.6% decreases in d18Odiatom which occurs at\n2.73 Ma (102.99 mbsf). Consequently, while a\nspecies effect may be partially influencing the\nGeochemistry\nGeophysics\nGeosystems G3 swann et al.: diatom oxygen isotopes 10.1029\/2006GC001535\n8 of 10\nisotope shift observed in these studies, we remain\ncertain that the large d18Odiatom decrease at circa\n2.73 Ma reflects the development of a halocline as\ndetailed by Haug et al. [2005] and Swann et al.\n[2006].\n5. Conclusion\n[23] The presence of large d18Odiatom offsets be-\ntween two size fractions at ODP site 882 repre-\nsents a notable problem for future uses of\nd18Odiatom in marine sediment cores, except in\ninstances where species relative biovolumes and\nsize ranges are constant or where the amount of\nchange in d18Odiatom between samples is suffi-\nciently high as to rule out any species effect. Both\ntaxa which dominate the two size fractions ana-\nlyzed here are primarily autumn\/winter blooming.\nWith all but one of the offsets marked by higher\nvalues in the 75\u2013150 mm fraction, a size related\nspecies effect may be present. Identifying the\nmechanisms behind such an effect though is\nproblematic. Given that the magnitude of the\noffsets varies throughout, it remains possible that\nthe offsets are also controlled by a combination of\nother interspecies and intraspecies effects. Conse-\nquently, we are currently unable to conclusively\nattribute the causes of these offsets to any single\nprocess. Further studies are required to investigate\nand understand the d18Odiatom signal with respect\nto intraspecies and interspecies offsets and the\nextent to which similar offsets may exist outside\nof C. marginatus and C. radiatus. In the mean-\nwhile, it is essential that samples analyzed for\nd18Odiatom be as size and species specific as\npossible in order to minimize or eliminate the\nspecies effects\/offsets observed here. This is par-\nticularly important in instances where the\nexpected magnitude of isotope change in a strati-\ngraphical sequence is low.\nAcknowledgments\n[24] The authors would like to thank Kozo Takahashi for\ndiscussions on diatom fluxes at station 50N, Makio C.
