Introduction \nIt is well known that chaotic behavior may occur in both a second-order digital \nfilter [Chua, 1988, 1990b; Galias, 1992; Kocarev, 1993, 1996; Wu, 1993; Yu, 2001] \nand a third-order digital filter [Chua, 1990a] with two\u2019s complement arithmetic. \nSimilar results are found in a second-order digital filter with other nonlinearities, such \nas a saturation-type nonlinearity [Galias, 1990] and a quantization-type nonlinearity \n[Lin, 1991]. \nHowever, it is found in this letter that chaotic behavior does not occur when all \nthe filter parameters are even numbers, no matter what the initial conditions, the order \nand the stability of digital filter are. The main results are shown in section 2, and a \nconclusion is summarized in section 3. \n \n2.  Simulation Results \nConsider the following Nth order digital filter with two\u2019s complement arithmetic: \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029kxkx jj 11 \uf02b\uf03d\uf02b  for 1,,2,1 \uf02d\uf03d Nj \uf04c  and 0\uf0b3k  (1) \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029kskxakxafkx\nN\nj\njj\nN\nj\njjN \uf0d7\uf02b\uf0d7\uf03d\uf0f7\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0d7\uf03d\uf02b \uf0e5\uf0e5\n\uf03d\uf03d\n21\n11\n for 0\uf0b3k  (2) \n 2 \nwhere \n\uf028 \uf029 nf \uf0d7\uf02d\uf03d 2\uf06e\uf06e  such that \uf028 \uf029 11 \uf03c\uf0a3\uf02d \uf06ef  and Z\uf0cen  (3) \n\uf0c2\uf0ceja  for Nj ,,2,1 \uf04c\uf03d  (4) \n\uf028 \uf029 11 \uf03c\uf0a3\uf02d kx j  for Nj ,,2,1 \uf04c\uf03d  and 0\uf0b3k  (5) \nand \uf028 \uf029 \uf07b \uf07dmmks ,,1,0,1,, \uf04c\uf04c \uf02d\uf02d\uf0ce  for 0\uf0b3k  (6) \nin which m is the minimum integer satisfying \n\uf028 \uf029 1212\n1\n\uf02b\uf0d7\uf03c\uf0d7\uf0a3\uf02d\uf0d7\uf02d \uf0e5\n\uf03d\nmkxam\nN\nj\njj  (7) \nAccording to our intensive simulations, we have the following observation: \nObservation. \nIf ja  is an even number and \uf028 \uf029 10 \uf03cjx  for Nj ,,2,1 \uf04c\uf03d , then \uf07b \uf07d00 \uf055\uf02b\uf0ce\uf024 Zk  such \nthat \uf028 \uf029 0\uf03dkx j  and \uf028 \uf029 0\uf03dks  for 0kk \uf0b3\uf022  and Nj ,,2,1 \uf04c\uf03d . \nIf \uf07b \uf07dNj ,,2,1 \uf04c\uf0ce\uf024  such that ja  is not an even number, and the system matrix of the \ndigital filter is unstable, then chaotic behavior may occur. \uf06e \nTo understand this phenomenon, we model the filtering process as a sum of \nBernoulli shift operations. Since, for practical implementation, any number is \nrepresented by only a finite number of bits, the initial condition can be represented in a \nbinary form as follows: \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf0e5\n\uf03d\n\uf02d\uf0d7\uf03d\nP\nn\nn\njnj px\n1\n, 20  (8) \nwhere \uf07b \uf07d1,0, \uf0cejnp  for Nj ,,2,1 \uf04c\uf03d  (9) \nand P  is the number of bits, not including the sign bit, for representing the state \nvariables. \nSince ja  are even numbers, we can let: \n\uf0e5\n\uf03d\n\uf0d7\uf03d\nM\nn\nn\njnja\n1\n, 2\uf061  (10) \nwhere \uf07b \uf07d1,0, \uf0cejn\uf061  for Nj ,,2,1 \uf04c\uf03d  (11) \nand M  is the number of bits, not including the sign bit, for representing the filter \ncoefficients.

Therefore, the state trajectories will eventually converge to some origin. \nTo demonstrate the observation, a third-order and a fourth-order digital filter \nwith two\u2019s complement arithmetic is shown. Results of higher order digital filter with \ntwo\u2019s complement arithmetic can be obtained similarly. \nFigure 1 shows the state variables and symbolic sequence of a third-order \ndigital filter with two\u2019s complement arithmetic when the filter parameters and the initial \nconditions are randomly generated from a set of even numbers and the set \uf05b \uf0291,1\uf02d , \nrespectively. It can be seen from the figure that when the filter parameters are even \nnumbers, though the system matrix is unstable, the values of the symbolic sequence \nand the state variables will be eventually zero. Similarly, figure 2 shows the cases with \nthe same initial condition as that in figure 1, but the filter parameters are deviated \nslightly from those in figure 1. In this case, chaotic behavior occurs. Similar results for \nthe fourth-order cases are shown in figure 3 and figure 4, respectively. \n \n3.  Conclusion \nIn this letter, we report some counter-intuitive simulation results that the \nsymbolic sequences and the state variables of a digital filter with two\u2019s complement \narithmetic and arbitrary initial conditions and order will be eventually zero when all the \nfilter parameters are even numbers, no matter the system matrix of the filter is stable or \nnot. \n \nAcknowledgement \n The work described in this letter was substantially supported by The Hong \nKong Polytechnic University. \n 4 \n \nReferences \n[1] Chua, L.
