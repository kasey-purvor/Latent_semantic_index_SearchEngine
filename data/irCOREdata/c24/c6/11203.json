Introduction\n[2] The cold dense inner region of the magnetosphere, the\nplasmasphere, is known to be highly dynamic. Its outer\nregions can be stripped away during geomagnetic storms to\nform plumes which convect through the dayside magneto-\nsphere toward the magnetopause, where the plasma is\nbelieved to be lost. Alternatively, flux tubes may be depleted\nby direct loss of plasma from the inner plasmasphere to the\nionosphere [e.g., Lemaire et al., 1998]. With decreasing\ngeomagnetic activity, depleted flux tubes are subsequently\nreplenished from the underlying ionosphere, i.e., they refill.\nWhile this pattern of activity is well documented [e.g.,\nChappell et al., 1971; Carpenter and Park, 1973; Carpenter\nand Anderson, 1992; Menk et al., 1999], the physics of\nthese processes, especially refilling, is not fully understood.\nAs yet we do not have a basic understanding of the time\ntaken for flux tubes to become depleted and subsequently\nto replenish, for example as a function of activity level, L-\nshell, or the local time of the flux tube at storm onset. The\ntime at which refilling commences can also be difficult to\ndetermine and so hinders thorough examination of the time\ndependence of these processes.\n[3] The primary cold ion population of the inner magne-\ntosphere is H+, with He+ usually being the secondary\npopulation. Observed He+\/H+ number density ratios vary\nfrom 0.01 to 0.5 [e.g., Taylor et al., 1965; Horwitz et al.,\n1984; Craven et al., 1997; Goldstein et al., 2003]. O+ is\nusually the third most dominant ion in the cold plasma\npopulation, although its number density can at times be\ncomparable to that of H+ [Horwitz et al., 1984]. The O+\nnumber density is typically 1\u20136 cm\u00013 in the plasmasphere,\nand while the admixture of these ion populations is often\nassumed to be stable with time and location, satellite\nobservations have shown an enhancement of the O+ popu-\nlation in the vicinity of the plasmapause following plasma\ndepletion episodes [e.g., Horwitz et al., 1984; Fraser et al.,\n2005].\n[4] In this paper we present ground-based magnetometer\nand IMAGE satellite Extreme UltraViolet (EUV) Imager\nand Radio Plasma Imager (RPI) results obtained throughout\na prolonged interval of moderate activity, 5\u201317 May 2001,\nduring which two geomagnetic storm associated depletion\nand subsequent refilling episodes occurred. In addition, the\nplasmapause location determined using two empirical mod-\nels is presented and compared to the observational results.\nPlasma depletion, refilling, and plasmapause dynamics are\nstudied, in addition to the heavy ion dynamics which took\nplace throughout the chosen interval.\n2. Instrumentation\n[5] The cold plasma population of the magnetosphere\nmay be monitored using a number of instruments and\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 111, A03205, doi:10.1029\/2005JA011046, 2006\n1Department of Physics, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta,\nCanada.\n2Space Science and Engineering Division, Southwest Research\nInstitute, San Antonio, Texas, USA.\n3School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences and CRC for Satellite\nSystems, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, New South Wales, Australia.\nCopyright 2006 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/06\/2005JA011046$09.00\nA03205 1 of 14\ntechniques. We will present data from ground-based mag-\nnetometers in the European sector and the IMAGE satellite\nRPI and EUV instruments.\n[6] The cross-phase technique has been developed in\norder to allow a latitudinal (or L-dependent) profile of field\nline resonance frequencies to be determined using arrays of\nlatitudinally separated ground-based magnetometers [e.g.,\nWaters et al., 1991; Baransky et al., 1989]. The technique\nassumes that each field line is excited at its natural frequency,\nalthough the power at this frequency need not dominate the\nspectra. By comparing the amplitude and phase spectra from\ntwo latitudinally separated ground-based magnetometer sta-\ntions, the local field line resonance frequency may be iden-\ntified. [Menk et al., 1999] first discussed the use of ULF field\nline resonances for examining temporal variations of plasma-\nspheric density, including poststorm refilling.\n[7] The natural field line resonance frequency of a flux\ntube is dependent upon the length of that tube, and the\nmagnetic field strength, plasma mass density, and their\ndistributions along the flux tube. By assuming some geo-\nmagnetic field geometry and plasma density distribution, an\nobserved latitudinal profile of resonance frequencies may be\ninverted in order to determine a plasma mass density profile\nin the equatorial plane. In order to achieve this for this\nstudy, the toroidal mode wave equation for a dipolar\ngeometry set out by Radoski [1967] has been solved\nnumerically, assuming a radial density distribution along a\nfield line \/ r\u0001a, with a = 0. In the plasmasphere a radial\ndensity variation with a = 1 or 0 is expected to be a\nreasonable approximation [e.g., Goldstein et al., 2001;\nDenton et al., 2004], whereas in the plasmatrough perhaps\na radial variation with a = 3 or 4 would be more appropriate\n[e.g., Angerami and Carpenter, 1966; Menk et al., 1999].\nThe difference in inferred density due to the choice of a\nbetween 0 and 4 is \u000320%, as determined for a field line\nresonance frequency of 10 mHz at L = 4.12. This variation\nis typically less than that due to the uncertainty associated\nwith determining the resonance frequencies for this study,\nand hence we have chosen to use a value of a = 0 for all L-\nshells, for the sake of consistency. Note that the value of a\nmay vary throughout plasma depletion and refilling inter-\nvals [e.g., Reinisch et al., 2001], or diurnally [e.g., Menk et\nal., 1999], although since its variation is poorly understood\nwe have chosen to use a single value throughout. The\ntreatment given by Ozeke and Mann [2005] for the iono-\nspheric boundary conditions for L-shells L \u0004 4.0 where the\ndipole magnetic field, B0, cannot be assumed to be perpen-\ndicular to the ionosphere has also been included. A thor-\nough review of this cross-phase technique is given, for\nexample, by Menk et al. [2004].\n[8] Note that the cross-phase method for determining a\nplasma mass density from a resonance frequency value\nmakes the assumption of oscillation in the purely toroidal\nmode. In reality, however, poloidal and toroidal modes will\nin general be coupled. Orr and Matthew [1971] estimated\nthat fundamental mode toroidal and guided poloidal fre-\nquencies differ by about 30% and Menk et al. [1999] note\nthat the actual density should fall somewhere between those\ncalculated for a purely toroidal and purely guided poloidal\nmode. Any possible errors resulting from the decoupled\ntoroidal mode assumption, or uncertainty associated with\nthe choice of the value of a, have not been included in the\nerror bars presented later in this paper.\n[9] The ground-based magnetometer data presented in\nthis paper are from three arrays in the European sector:\nSAMNET (Sub-Auroral Magnetometer Network (http:\/\/\nwww.dcs.lancs.ac.uk\/iono\/samnet\/)) [e.g., Yeoman et al.,\n1990], IMAGE (International Monitor for Auroral Geomag-\nnetic Effects (http:\/\/www.ava.fmi.fi\/image\/)) [e.g., Lu\u00a8hr et\nal., 1998], and BGS (British Geological Survey, data\navailable from SAMNET). The station pairs employed for\nthe cross-phase analysis presented in this paper are given in\nTable 1. Errors associated with cross-phase determined\ndensities are calculated from the range of uncertainty\nassociated with determining the field line resonance\nfrequencies.\nTable 1.

If the local plasma frequency cannot\nbe identified, then the upper hybrid frequency is used in\nassociation with a magnetic field model in order to determine\nthe local plasma frequency.\n[11] In situ measurements of RPI determined densities are\npresented in this paper, i.e., no attempt has been made to\nmap the in situ values to the equatorial plane. Goldstein et\nal. [2001] note that the plasma density variation across field\nlines is often greater than along them. They studied Polar\nplasma wave data between L = 2.3 and 6.3 and for\ngeocentric distance r \u0005 2 RE in order to determine in situ\nelectron number densities and found that density varied\nalong field lines as r0.37\u00b10.8 in the plasmasphere and as\nr\u00011.7\u00b11.1 in the plasmatrough. Gallagher et al. [2000]\nstudied data from the RIMS instrument on board the DE-\n1 satellite and found little systematic variation of plasma\ndensity with latitude along field lines, within \u000340\u0002 of the\nmagnetic equator. More recently, Goldstein et al. [2003]\ndetermined that by assuming a constant density along a field\nline, within 20\u0002 of the geomagnetic equator in the plasma-\nsphere and 40\u0002 in the plasmatrough, caused a maximum\noverestimation of equatorial electron number density values\nof \u000410% in the plasmasphere and \u000430% in the plasma-\ntrough. The IMAGE RPI data presented in this paper were\ncollected from magnetic latitudes between 46\u0002N to 18\u0002S,\nand L-shells between 1.90 and 9.65. Thus it is appropriate\nto treat the in situ electron number densities determined via\nthe IMAGE RPI instrument as a proxy for the equatorial\nelectron number density. The maximum error associated\nwith experimentally determining the in situ electron number\ndensity is believed to arise due to errors in determining the\nelectron plasma frequency from emission spectra, and this\nerror is assumed to be 12%.\n[12] The EUV Imager on board the IMAGE satellite\ncurrently provides the best single-instrument view of the\nglobal plasmasphere [e.g., Sandel et al., 2000]. It detects\n30.4 nm ultraviolet light which has been resonantly scat-\ntered by the He+ population of the plasmasphere. The\nimages produced have spatial and temporal resolutions\nof \u00030.1 RE and \u000310 min, respectively, in two-dimensional\n(2-D) line-of-sight integrated pictures [e.g., Goldstein et al.,\n2003, 2004].\n[13] The plasmapause location values presented in this\npaper have been determined via visual inspection of EUV\nimages which have been mapped to the equatorial plane (as\ndescribed for a single point by Goldstein et al. [2003]).\nGoldstein et al. [2003] note that the uncertainty associated\nwith these values is dependent upon the sharpness of the\nplasmapause and is about 0.2 RE for a sharp He\n+ edge, and\n0.4\u20130.8 RE for diffuse structures.\n[14] Goldstein et al. [2003] compared the plasmapause\nlocation as identified via RPI and EUV analysis throughout\none month and found a very good correlation between the\ntwo techniques. Dent et al. [2003] compared ground-based\nmagnetometer cross-phase and RPI determined plasma\nmass densities for a 1-day case study, and while there\nwas excellent agreement in the inner plasmasphere, differ-\nences in the outer plasmasphere were identified by EUV\nFigure 1.

Therefore the combined use of the RPI, EUV\nand ground-based magnetometer cross-phase techniques\nfor this study should provide a valuable insight into the\ndynamics of plasmapause motion, and flux tube depletion\nand refilling which took place throughout the study\ninterval.\n3. Observations\n[15] The data to be presented are from 5 to 17 May 2001,\nan extended interval of moderate geomagnetic activity\nduring which two plasma depletion episodes took place.\nThis event was chosen because every three days the\nIMAGE satellite had an excellent ground magnetic field\nline conjunction with the European magnetometer arrays\nused, enabling the long timescale of plasmaspheric mor-\nphology to be studied, including five ground-satellite \u2018\u2018con-\njunction\u2019\u2019 days.\n[16] Figure 1 shows a stack plot of the Dst and Kp\ngeomagnetic indices, the IMF BZ (GSM coordinates), and\nthe solar wind bulk speed and dynamic pressure. The solar\nwind parameters were measured by the MAG (magne-\ntometer) and SWEPAM (Solar Wind Proton Alpha Mon-\nitor) instruments on board the ACE satellite (http:\/\/\nwww.srl.caltech.edu\/ACE). From the location of the\nACE satellite\u00031.45\u0006 106 km upstream, and at a bulk speed\nof\u0003400 km s\u00011, the solar wind takes approximately 1 hour to\ntravel to a nominalmagnetopause at 10RE, thus the solarwind\ndata have been delayed by 1 hour. The vertical lines indicate\nthe times of the ground-based and IMAGE (RPI) conjunc-\ntions to be presented later, and which are shown in Figure 2.\n[17] Early on 7 May an increase in the level of geomag-\nnetic activity was associated with a southward turning of the\nIMF and slight increases of the solar wind bulk speed and\ndynamic pressure. The minimum value of Dst occurred\nearly on 10 May, marking the end of the storm main phase.\nThis interval relates to the first depletion episode to be\nexamined below. A second depletion episode followed from\nthe enhanced level of geomagnetic activity occurring from\nearly on 12 May until 13 May. Note that the IMF was\ndirected southward for much of the interval between 7 and\n17 May 2001, and the Dst index showed depressed values\nfor a much longer interval than for most geomagnetic\nstorms.\n[18] Two studies have been carried out for this interval.\nFirst, a long timescale study was undertaken of cross-phase\ndetermined field-line resonance frequency and corresponding\nplasma mass density profiles, IMAGE EUV determined\nplasmapause locations and empirically modeled plasma-\npause positions, and daily morning sector IMAGE RPI\ndetermined electron number density profiles. This study\naims to examine the storm-time cold plasma dynamics\nand to gain some further understanding of the cold\nplasma depletion and refilling processes taking place,\nand how they are dependent on the time history of the\nlocal meridian being monitored. Second, a conjunction\nstudy compared cross-phase determined plasma mass\ndensity and IMAGE RPI determined electron number\ndensity profiles for the 5 days where the ground magnetic\nfootprint of the IMAGE satellite had an excellent con-\njunction with ground-based magnetometers in the Euro-\npean sector. This second study also aims to examine the\ndynamics of any heavy ion population which may be\npresent during the course of this geomagnetic storm.\n3.1. Long Timescale Study\n[19] Figures 3 and 4 show stacked plots of daily field line\nresonance frequency (eigenfrequency) profiles and the\ncorresponding plasma mass density profiles (shown as\nsemilog plots), respectively. These have been determined\nvia the cross-phase technique for the 0900\u20131000 UT\ninterval each day, using data windows of between 20 and\n50 min duration. The previous day\u2019s profile is repeated in\nthe following panel for ease of comparison of day to day\nvariations. Error bars show the uncertainty associated with\ndetermining the observed frequency value, and the range of\ndensities calculated using this range of frequency values.\nThe arrows shown at the bottom of each panel in Figures 3\nand 4 show the EUV determined plasmapause location; the\ngrey arrow represents the first day in each panel, and the\nblack panel the second day. These arrows show the median\nof the range of values of EUV determined plasmapause\nlocation determined for the magnetic longitude region\ncovered by the ground-based magnetometers (74.87\u0002\u2013\n108.81\u0002) and for the 0900\u20131000 UT interval where avail-\nable. On the days when EUV data is not available for the\n0900\u20131000 UT interval the median of the range of values\ndetermined for the same magnetic longitude sector and for\nthe closest UT interval available before or after the 0900\u2013\n1000 UT interval is shown. Goldstein et al. [2003] note that\nthis process should be carried out in order to minimize any\neffects of erosion or refilling in the intervening time. The\naverage range of values for EUV plasmapause location\ndetermined from a single EUV image for the longitude\nregion of interest is 0.90 RE.\nFigure 2.

Geographic coordinate\ngrid lines and the time intervals of the IMAGE RPI data sets\nare shown. During these intervals the IMAGE satellite\npassed through magnetic latitudes from 45.71\u0002N to\n17.81\u0002S. Satellite data was obtained from SSCWeb,\nhttp:\/\/sscweb.gsfc.nasa.gov, assuming Tsyganenko 89 ex-\nternal and IGRF internal geomagnetic fields.\nA03205 DENT ET AL.: PLASMASPHERIC DEPLETION AND REFILLING\n4 of 14\nA03205\n[20] In response to the first interval of enhanced geomag-\nnetic activity on 7 May, significant plasmaspheric erosion\noccurred at L < 4.12 between 8 and 9 May (Figure 4). The\nEUV determined plasmapause locations in this plot show it\nmoving inward from L > 4.7 to L < 3.0 in the same interval,\nand the eigenfrequency profile shows a positive gradient\nbetween L = 2.39 and L = 2.67 on 9 May (Figure 3), which\nis indicative of the plasmapause [e.g., Orr and Hanson,\n1981]. Inside the EUV determined plasmapause, the density\nalso decreases. Such loss is common and the plasma is\nunderstood to be lost to the underlying ionosphere [e.g.,\nBezrukikh et al., 2001; Carpenter and Lemaire, 1997]. Note\nthat in the plasmatrough (L > 4.5) the density varied by\napproximately an order of magnitude between 5 and 8 May\nin this local time sector but showed little variability between\n8 and 10 May. This is consistent with the observation made\nby Goldstein et al. [2003] of more structure in the plasma-\ntrough during quiet intervals as compared with active\nintervals.\n[21] Between 9 and 10 May the positive gradient along\nthe eigenfrequency profile moved outward by a fraction of\nan L-shell but otherwise showed little change until 12 May,\nimplying almost no cold plasma loss or refilling took place\nthrough this interval. Note that on 11 May there is a lack of\ndata points between L = 2.67 and 3.90 due to a suppression\nof the cross-phase peak. This is indicative of the station\nFigure 4.

The eigenfrequency profile (Figure 3)\nand corresponding plasma mass density profile (Figure 4)\nfor this day are not monotonic between L = 3.4 and 4.1 and\nshow the presence of a small-scale density feature in this\nregion. The ability to again be able to perform cross-phase\nanalysis in this region shows that the plasmapause density\ngradient has evolved since 11 May. This is confirmed by the\nEUV determined plasmapause location indicating outward\nmotion to L \u0003 3.7 from L \u0003 2.7. The UT interval of this\nprofile is prior to the onset of enhanced solar wind parameter\nvalues, so the plasmapause motion taking place between 11\nand 12May indicates poststorm plasma refilling taking place.\nPlasmaspheric erosion following this second interval of\nenhanced activity took place between L = 2.6\u20133.8 and 12\u2013\n13 May, being complete within 24\u201348 hours of the enhance-\nment of activity.\n[23] Figure 5a shows IMAGE EUV determined plasma-\npause locations (plus symbols) as a function of UT for a\nconstant MLT sector, chosen to be that spanned by the\nEuropean sector ground-based magnetometers at 0930 UT.\nAlso plotted are plasmapause locations as determined from\nthe Orr and Webb [1975] (OW75, black line) and O\u2019Brien\nand Moldwin [2003] (OBM03, grey line) empirical models.\nThe LT dependent OW75 model is driven by the previous\nlocal nighttime average Kp index and was developed to\ndetermine the location of the 10 H+\/cc density. This model\nhas an uncertainty of 0.4 L and is not valid for average Kp >\n4. The MLT dependent OBM03 model is driven by the Dst\nindex and was developed to determine the location of a\nplasmapause, as identified by a decrease of electron number\ndensity by a factor of five in less than 0.5 L. This model is\nvalid for \u0001298 nT \u0004 Dst \u0004 \u00012 nT and has an uncertainty of\n0.53 L for the daytime sector. The model plasmapause\nlocations were calculated for MLT and LT corresponding to\nthe midtime of the range covered by the European sector\nground-based magnetometers 0930 UT.\n[24] For comparison, Figure 5b similarly shows IMAGE\nEUV and empirical model predictions as a function of UT,\nbut for a constant (i.e., corotating) magnetic longitude\nsector, equivalent to that spanned by the ground-based\nmagnetometer array employed. The empirical model pre-\ndictions have been plotted in order to show the statistically\nexpected plasmapause location and to compare these pre-\ndictions to observations. In particular, Figure 5b shows the\nexpected diurnal variations of plasmapause location in\naddition to the storm-time dynamics and hence helps to\ndifferentiate between these two effects in the EUV data. The\ntwo panels of Figure 5 show that considerable azimuthal\nasymmetry is present in the outer plasmasphere and that the\nlocal time history of a particular flux tube is important when\nstudying storm-time cold plasma dynamics.\n[25] The larger amount of scatter shown in Figure 5a\ncompared to Figure 5b is explained by the fact that all\nmeridians are being monitored in Figure 5a, and so azi-\nmuthal asymmetry due to different convection histories\npresents itself in the scatter. Figure 5b shows a small range\nof scatter, which although we are following the trajectory of\nan assumed corotating meridian, may be explained by\nsmall-scale or mesoscale azimuthal asymmetry present in\nFigure 5.

The EUVobservations tend to\nshow better agreement with the OW75 model results when\nthe plasmapause was located at higher L-shells (i.e., during\nquieter intervals), and with the OBM03 model results when\nthe plasmapause was located at lower L-shells (i.e., during\nmore active intervals). Also, the OBM03 predicted values\nare mostly inward of the OW75 model predictions due to\nthe plasmapause identification criteria of each model men-\ntioned above. Note that these comparisons are similar to\nthose of Webb et al. [1977], who also compared OW75\nmodel predictions to observations. Webb et al. [1977]\nadvised that using statistical plasmapause models to gain\nphysical understanding should be carried out with caution.\n[28] Comparing the EUV Lpp locations in the two panels\nof Figure 5 one can gain an understanding of how the\nplasma depletion caused by the enhanced geomagnetic\nactivity beginning on 7 May occurred. In Figure 5a a steady\ninward motion of the plasmapause is shown from 8 May\nuntil early on 10 May. The plasmapause moves steadily\ninward in the morning LT sector as freshly depleted flux\ntubes rotate into view. Note that the plasmaspheric erosion\ntakes place over a period of 2 days. After 10 May poststorm\nplasma refilling takes place, as shown by an outward motion\nof the plasmapause. Figure 5b shows some depletion\nthrough 8 May, and an inward plasmapause motion of\n>1 RE between late on 8May and early on 9May. Throughout\n9 and 10 May the plasmapause undergoes a diurnal cycle\nwhile the plasmasphere remains depleted. For this meridian\nthe depletion occurred over a period >1 day, followed by an\nadditional delay of 1\u20132 days before refilling began.\n[29] On 11 May both panels show a large range of EUV\ndetermined plasmapause location, implying either a high\ndegree of azimuthal asymmetry associated with the onset of\nrefilling or difficulty in determining the plasmapause loca-\ntion. The larger spread of plasmapause locations certainly\nimplies that some cold plasma morphology changes had\ntaken place since 10 May.\n[30] Figure 5b shows that through 12 May the plasma-\npause was moving outward before moving inward later on\n12 May and early on 13 May. The renewed activity began\non 12 May so this plasmapause behavior is explained by\ncontinued plasma refilling followed by renewed depletion\nas the flux tubes passed through the nightside sector. This\npanel shows the plasmapause residing between L \u0003 2.5 and\nL \u0003 4.0 through most of 13 and 14 May, although the UT\ncoverage is not as good as other days. The outward motion\nof the plasmapause from 14 until 17 May, and a large\noutward motion through 17 May clearly shows that refilling\nwas taking place over this extended interval.\n[31] A similarly clear picture of this secondary depletion\nand refilling is not present in Figure 5a, again demonstrating\nthat the local time history of each meridian is very impor-\ntant, especially when the interval of enhanced geomagnetic\nactivity was not sustained for a long period, as it was\nfollowing 7 May. Importantly, plasmaspheric erosion may\noccur to different L-shells along different meridians, as\nshown by the large scatter in the Lpp values throughout\n13\u201315 May. Such a result is expected on a statistical basis\nfrom empirical models which use the local nightside geo-\nmagnetic index of the meridian of interest [e.g., Orr and\nWebb, 1975; Carpenter and Anderson, 1992].\n[32] Figure 5 therefore shows that when studying storm-\ntime plasmapause dynamics the local time history of a\nmeridian is important. The time when depletion occurs\nand when refilling begins is not simply dependent upon\nthe time since the convection activity began but also the\nlocal time sector which the flux tube resided in when\nactivity began and the duration of the enhanced geomag-\nnetic activity. This in agreement with convection theory\n[e.g., Nishida, 1966], i.e., azimuthal symmetry should not\nbe assumed when monitoring storm time plasma loss and\nrefilling.\n[33] Following the activity interval beginning on 12 May\nthe plasmasphere was not eroded to as low an L-shell as for\nthe earlier interval which began on 7May, consistent with the\nKp and Dst indices showing an overall weaker level of\ngeomagnetic activity. For the second event the plasmapause\nreached just beyond L = 3, shown by the positive gradient\nalong the eigenfrequency profile on 13 May (Figure 3), and\nthe EUV determined plasmapause location (Figures 4 and 5).\nRefilling at L \u0003 2.9 occurred between 13 and 14 May, and\nsmaller amounts of refilling between L \u0003 3 and 5 continued\nthrough to 17 May.\n[34] Figure 6 shows semilog plots of IMAGE RPI deter-\nmined electron number density profiles for the 4\u201317 May\n2001. Each panel shows profiles obtained at \u00033 day\nintervals as the IMAGE satellite ground magnetic footprint\nwas in the corresponding shaded area shown in Figure 7.\nEach profile was obtained in the 0850\u20131030 MLT sector.\nThese results have been grouped in this way in order to\nexamine the storm-time cold plasma dynamics along differ-\nent meridians with different local time histories. In partic-\nular the time of onset of plasma loss and refilling are of\ninterest. By examining one MLT sector, diurnal variations of\nplasma loss to and upflow from the ionosphere to the\nmagnetosphere may be neglected.\n[35] Following the storm onset early on 7 May two very\ndifferent density profiles are obtained. Panel 2 of Figure 6\nshows that \u00035\u20136 hours after the onset of enhanced geo-\nmagnetic activity the meridian which had been in the\nmorning sector throughout the period of enhanced activity\nhad an extended electron number density profile with no\nclear plasmapause, i.e., the effects of the storm are not yet\napparent along this meridian. Panel 4, however, shows that\n19\u201320 hours after the storm onset the meridian which\npassed through the afternoon, evening, and nightside sectors\nhad undergone significant depletion, as shown by the\ninward motion of the plasmapause from L \u0003 5.5 to L \u0003\n4.5. All other panels show that some depletion occurred\nbetween the profile preceding 7 May and that succeeding it,\nalthough the new plasmapause location and its density\ngradient varies from one meridian to another. For example,\nreturning to panel 2, the profile for 10 May has a plasma-\npause at L \u0003 2.2, but later in the day, along the meridian\nA03205 DENT ET AL.: PLASMASPHERIC DEPLETION AND REFILLING\n7 of 14\nA03205\nFigure 6.

Note that lines are\ndrawn connecting data points only to guide the eye.\nFigure 7. Map showing five areas of IMAGE satellite ground magnetic footprint corresponding to data\npresented in Figure 6. Satellite data was obtained as for Figure 2.\nA03205 DENT ET AL.: PLASMASPHERIC DEPLETION AND REFILLING\n8 of 14\nA03205\nalmost 140\u0002 east, panel 4 shows a plasmapause with a more\ngentle gradient between L \u0003 3.2 and 3.8. Note that if one\nfollows all of the profiles presented in Figure 6 purely\nchronologically as the meridians rotate through the fixed\nlocal-time sector, the storm-time dynamics are not smoothly\nvarying due to the different responses along each meridian.\nA similar result was also shown by Reinisch et al. [2004],\nwho examined IMAGE RPI determined electron number\ndensity profiles in the noon sector from successive orbits\nthroughout an interval of plasmaspheric depletion and\nrefilling. These results highlight the effects of a time-varying\nconvection electric field and\/or shielding as the different\nmeridians rotate through the region where plasma depletion\noccurs.\n[36] The first four panels in Figure 6 imply that depletion\ntook place for several days up until 11 May, the day\nfollowing the peak of geomagnetic activity as shown by\nthe Dst and Kp indices. This is shown by a gradually inward\nmoving plasmapause through this interval in each of these\npanels. Following the second, shorter-lived, interval of\nenhanced activity on 12 May, different meridians monitored\ndifferent behavior. While some meridians were eroded to\ninward of their pre-12 May plasmapause location, e.g.,\npanels 1 and 4, others show no clear erosion, e.g., panels\n2 and 3. At the coarse time resolution offered one cannot\ndiscount the possibility of some refilling taking place in\naddition to depletion, although this is unlikely given the\nregions, dates, and geomagnetic conditions prevalent.\n[37] Regardless of whether depletion clearly occurred\nalong any specific meridian following the 12 May activity,\nall panels show refilling taking place toward the end of the\nstudy interval. These profiles also show differing plasma-\npause profiles, some having a steep density gradient (e.g.,\n16 May, panel 2) and others a shallow density gradient and\nincreased plasmatrough densities (e.g., 17 May, panel 1).\nThis may imply that (1) the manner in which a meridian\nrefills is dependent upon the convection activity occurring\nthroughout refilling [e.g., Singh and Horwitz, 1992], and\/or\n(2) refilling is an L-dependent process, taking place faster at\nlow L-shells where flux tubes have a smaller volume [e.g.,\nLemaire et al., 1998].\n3.2. Conjunction Study\n[38] This extended interval of enhanced geomagnetic\nactivity is ideal for a coordinated ground-based magnetom-\neter and IMAGE satellite study, because the IMAGE\nsatellite\u2019s 14.2 hour orbit produced an excellent ground\nmagnetic footprint conjunction with ground-based magne-\ntometer arrays in the European sector approximately every\nthree days throughout the study interval. The Northern\nHemisphere magnetic footprints of the IMAGE satellite\norbit for conjunctions on 5, 8, 11, 14, and 17 May 2001 are\nshown in Figure 2. The times shown are those when electron\nnumber densities presented in this section were determined\nusing IMAGE RPI instrument data. Figure 8 shows five\nsemilog plots of plasma mass density as a function of L-shell\nfor these conjunctions, a dashed horizontal line having been\nadded at 100 amu\/cc to aid comparison. In situ RPI derived\nelectron number densities have been converted to plasma\nmass densities by assuming a solely H+ ion plasma. EUV\nplasmapause locations are shown by arrows. Similar to\nGoldstein et al. [2003], these locations have been calcu-\nlated as the median value determined from the closest\nimages in UT for prior and post orbits which bracket the\nRPI and cross-phase measurements (hence they are not\ncoincident in UT). When the RPI and cross-phase mea-\nsurements are not bracketed with EUV observations for a\nparticular day, the EUV plasmapause location closest in\nUT is shown.\n[39] The cross-phase determined plasma mass density\nprofiles include mass contributions from all ion species\npresent along the flux tube, while the RPI derived mass\ndensity has been calculated from electron density assuming\na pure H+ plasma. Thus any difference between the two\nprofiles may identify either a heavy ion (He+ and\/or O+)\npopulation or azimuthal asymmetry.\n[40] By monitoring a long time interval and using repeated\nground-satellite conjunctions in the same local time sector,\nthis study hoped to avoid issues associated with intercalibra-\ntion and azimuthal asymmetry effects [cf. Dent et al., 2003],\nthus allowing day-to-day heavy ion dynamics to be moni-\ntored. Note that only during such very close conjunctionsmay\nany inferences be confidently made about heavy ions. Any\ninferences of heavy ion proportions determined from com-\nparison of the ground-based cross-phase and in situ RPI\nplasmamass densities will not provide any information about\nwhat specific heavy ion species are present, or their admix-\nture. However, by monitoring several days it is possible to\nascertain both whether the heavy ion population has been\nenhanced (depleted) and whether the hydrogen population\nhas been depleted (enhanced).\n[41] For the most part, the two mass density profiles\npresented in each panel of Figure 8 show small separation\nand often agree within the bounds of error. On 5 May, in the\nplasmatrough beyond L = 6 the two profiles diverge. The\nMLT difference between the data sets in this region was at\nmost \u00033 hours 20 min. The day 5 May was a quiet prestorm\nday, in an advanced stage of refilling, as shown by the\nshallow density profiles. On such days irregular azimuthal\ndensity structure is commonly seen in the plasmatrough\nregion [e.g., Goldstein et al., 2003; Dent et al., 2003].\nExamining the IMAGE EUV images for 0733 UT and\n1735 UT (the closest available in UT, not shown), a\nplume is evident in the dayside sector of the earlier image\nbut is mostly gone by the later image. Also, the geosyn-\nchronous LANL_1994_084 satellite MPA data (not\nshown) shows a plume filling the dayside from \u00030800\nto 1800 MLT (\u00030100\u20131100 UT). Although sampling a\ndifferent sector than the conjunction study these data\nshow the plume density being greater in the cross-phase\nprofile MLT sector than in the IMAGE RPI MLT sector.\nNote that Spasojevic\u00b4 et al. [2003] found that plumes may\nnot corotate or may corotate at a fraction of the corota-\ntion speed. Thus from these extra data sets the difference\nbetween the cross-phase and IMAGE RPI determined\nplasma density values at L \u0003 6.5 may be attributed to\nazimuthal asymmetry owing to the MLT separation of the\ndata sets and the existence of the dayside plume.\n[42] The second region of interest with respect to heavy\nions is 14 May, beyond L = 4.0 in the plasmatrough region\n(Figure 8). The cross-phase determined plasma mass den-\nsities are significantly greater than the RPI determined\ndensities in this region, as compared with the other days.\nThe cross-phase density values beyond L = 4.0 are similar\nA03205 DENT ET AL.: PLASMASPHERIC DEPLETION AND REFILLING\n9 of 14\nA03205\nto or greater than those of 11 May, and the RPI determined\nvalues are generally smaller. In terms of ion interchange,\nthis shows that the total number of ions has decreased, yet\nthe total mass density has increased, implying an increase in\nthe number of heavy ions present beyond L = 4.0 from\n11 May to 14 May. For this conjunction the two data sets\nhad a maximum MLT separation of 2 hours 00 min.\nExamining the IMAGE EUV image for 0354 UT on 14\nMay (not shown) shows that the plasmapause in the\nmagnetic longitude sector corresponding to the conjunction\nstudy (assuming appropriate corotation through the dawn\nsector) [e.g., Burch et al., 2004] was regularly shaped with\nno clearly identifiable density feature which could explain\nthe differing results. Thus for this day the differing densities\nin the plasmatrough region are most likely due to an\nenhanced heavy ion population, rather than azimuthal\nasymmetry.\n[43] As the admixture of the H+, He+, and O+ ions is\nunknown, calculations of the density of individual specific\nion species is not possible from comparisons of plasma\nmass and electron number density observations. Instead an\n\u2018\u2018ion mass factor\u2019\u2019 may be calculated [e.g., Takahashi et al.,\n2004]. This is the ratio of the observed mass density to the\nmass density calculated from the electron density assuming\na purely H+ plasma. Between L = 4.0 and 5.0 this value\nvaries between \u00031.8 and 4.1, decreasing with increasing L.\nThis compares well with ion mass factor values between 2\nand 6, as determined by Takahashi et al. [2004] using\nCRRES data for the 1200\u20131800 MLT sector and 4 < L <\n8 throughout the CRRES mission.\n[44] While our analysis cannot provide any information\nabout the relative contributions of specific heavy ion species\nwhich may be present, our observations can be explained by\nthe presence of an enhanced O+ population in the inner\nplasmatrough following a depletion episode, similar to that\nobserved by Horwitz et al. [1984] using DE-1 RIMS data.\nHorwitz et al. [1984] observed a torus of O+ and O++ ions in\nthe inner plasmatrough during a disturbed interval and on\nthe quiet day which followed. Horwitz et al. [1984] also\nfound that this population initially had a field-aligned flow,\nFigure 8. Cross-phase and IMAGE RPI determined plasma mass density profiles for 5, 8, 11, 14, and\n17 May 2001. Arrows indicate the plasmapause location determined via IMAGE EUVanalysis. Note that\nlines are drawn connecting data points only to guide the eye.\nA03205 DENT ET AL.: PLASMASPHERIC DEPLETION AND REFILLING\n10 of 14\nA03205\nwhile the H+ and He+ populations were essentially station-\nary and isotropic. Similarly, Singh and Horwitz [1992]\nfound that during the intermediate stages of refilling the\nconcentration of O+ ions was enhanced in the almost-filled\nplasmasphere. Horwitz et al. [1984] also found for their\nstudy that the He+\/H+ ratio was reasonably constant with L\nin both the plasmasphere and plasmatrough regions. The\ninferences made about the heavy ion dynamics occurring\nduring the study presented here are entirely consistent with\na scenario of an enhanced oxygen ion torus in the plasma-\ntrough region, outside the recently depleted plasmasphere.\n[45] The source of such an enhanced O+ population may\nbe the ionosphere. Using the Millstone Hill incoherent\nscatter radar Yeh and Foster [1990] monitored upward O+\noutflow during a large magnetic storm and state that these\nions constituted a significant source of 1 eV O+ ions to the\noverlying magnetosphere during such intervals.\n[46] Note that on 17 May the cross-phase and RPI density\nprofiles once again show very good agreement, suggesting\nthat at this time very few heavy ions were present.\n[47] For 17 May no clear plasmapause is apparent, but a\nslight increase of density gradient occurs around L \u0003 4.7,\nslightly inward of the EUV determined plasmapause loca-\ntion. Thus where a clear, steep plasmapause is present, the\nEUV determined plasmapause location generally agrees\nwell with the RPI and cross-phase determined plasmapause\nlocations. Comparing the density profiles and the EUV\nplasmapause locations in Figure 8 shows that the well-\ndefined plasmapause is generally located between plasma\nmass densities of 1000 and 100 amu\/cc and often between\n500 and 100 amu\/cc.\n[48] Note that in Figure 8, for 14 May, the RPI deter-\nmined plasma mass density profile is much steeper through\nthe plasmapause than that determined via the cross-phase\nanalysis. For two of the cross-phase station pairs in the\nplasmapause region (L = 3.16 and L = 3.34) a negative\ncross-phase peak was observed for part of this day (at the\nsame UT and LT of the RPI observations). Such an observa-\ntion is consistent with the plasmamass density gradient being\nsteep enough to overcome the magnetic field (length and\nstrength) L-shell dependence to produce a reversal in the local\nAlfve\u00b4n frequency gradient. This will be discussed further in a\nseparate paper.\n4. Discussion\n[49] The interval studied here contained two cold plasma\ndepletion episodes, one following the initial increase of\nactivity early on 7 May and the second following the\nincrease of activity which began early on 12 May. The\ntime taken for plasmaspheric erosion to be completed was\n3\u20134 days following the first onset interval on 7 May and\n24\u201348 hours following the second onset on 12 May.\nAlthough the geomagnetic indices presented in Figure 1\nshow further enhanced activity later on 13 May, no\nfurther plasma loss is apparent. Song et al. [1988] studied\nGEOS-2 geosynchronous satellite data and found that a\nminimum electron number density was observed 1 or 2 days\nafter the day of minimum Dst. This time delay was attributed\nto limited convection velocity. The results presented in this\npaper showgood agreementwith this observation. It therefore\nseems that the length of time taken for depletion to be\ncompleted depends upon the length of the storm main phase\nand the local time-history of a particular meridian.\n[50] A difficulty with studying plasma depletion is the\nuncertainty in determining the beginning and duration of the\ndepletion interval, if a sector is depleted at all. During one\nevent, Spasojevic\u00b4 et al. [2003] found a correlation between\nnightside inward velocity of the plasmapause to the instanta-\nneous strength of IMFBz.Other studies show that the onset of\ndepletion is expected to occur in the local dusk region,\nhowever [e.g., Kersley and Klobuchar, 1980; Degenhardt\net al., 1977]. These results are not mutually exclusive.\nDuskside loss may be associated with convection to the\nmagnetopause, whereas nightside plasmapause motion\nmay indicate loss to the ionosphere [e.g., Carpenter\nand Lemaire, 1997].\n[51] Our results show that there is a local time asymmetry\ninvolved in the depletion process such that all sectors\nmonitored were not depleted simultaneously or to the same\nL-shell. Spasojevic\u00b4 et al. [2003] reported the presence of\ncrenulations, bulges, and shoulders in the dayside sector\nduring geomagnetically disturbed intervals. Thus azimuthal\nvariation of plasmapause location could be formed in\nresponse to the time-varying IMF Bz (and thus time-varying\nconvection electric field) as each meridian passed through\nthe nightside sector. A nonuniform convection electric field\nor shielding may also cause azimuthally asymmetric plas-\nmapause erosion.\n[52] The depletion, calculated as a percentage of the\nprestorm plasma remaining, has been determined for L =\n2.92 and L = 4.12 for each plasma erosion event. At L =\n4.12 the value calculated for the first and second intervals\nwere 22% and 37%, while at L = 2.92 depletion was 7% and\n18%, respectively. This suggests a dependence on both L\nand the time taken for depletion to complete. These values\nmay be compared to those of Reinisch et al. [2004] and\nDegenhardt et al. [1977]. Reinisch et al. [2004] used\nIMAGE RPI data to determine a depletion value of <33%\nat L = 2.84, and Degenhardt et al. [1977] used TEC values\nin the plasmasphere up to geosynchronous orbit to deter-\nmine a depletion value of 50%. Note that our values were\ncalculated using data from Figure 4, so at this resolution the\nmaximum prestorm or minimum poststorm values may not\nTable 2.

Daily\nrefilled densities have been determined for L = 4.12 (HAN-\nOUL) using the results presented in Figure 4 and from the\nmaximum observed density each day (note that the plasma\nmass density may have increased further beyond the limit of\nthe cross-phase observations each day). These values are\nshown in Table 2 and may be considered to be daily refilling\nrates. Any corotation lag occurring would mean that exactly\nthe same flux tube is not monitored from day to day. Using\nground-based instruments this cannot be avoided, however.\n[54] These refilling values show that the local time when\nrefilling is calculated is a very important factor. While the\nlocal morning sector results show the amount refilled each\nday increasing with time, the daily maximum values from\nthe afternoon sector show varying amounts of plasma\ndensity increase for the first 3 days and a very large increase\non the fourth day. The afternoon values represent the state\nof the flux tube after one extra day of refilling than the\nmorning values for the same day, but regardless of this\ndifferent refilling trends are shown in the two local time\nsectors. Note also that the daily maximum values show no\nrefilling between 13 and 14 May. This may be explained by\nplasma drainage in the afternoon sector of 14 May or heavy\nion interchange with the underlying ionosphere.\n[55] These results suggest that the nightside loss of\nplasma to the ionosphere is an important factor in moder-\nating the rate of refilling. Note also that no net refilling took\nplace throughout 16 May so daytime refilling must depend\nupon other factors than simply the lack of plasma along the\nflux tube.\n[56] Song et al. [1988] suggested that the prevailing Dst\nwill moderate the refilling rate and developed an empirical\nmodel based on GEOS-2 data for determining refilling rate\nat geosynchronous orbit in duskside bulge region. Assum-\ning that the refilling rate from the ionosphere is constant per\nunit area across dipolar L-shells, then the refilling rate, dr\/\ndt, will scale \u0003L\u00014 under the approximation that 1\/L \u0007 1.\nUsing their formula and scaling according to L\u00014 gives a\nvalue at L = 4.12 of 95 electrons\/cm3\/day throughout the\nrefilling interval observed. This result has better agreement\nwith our morning-side results than our afternoon sector\nones.\n[57] The refilling rates monitored in the afternoon sector\nby the HAN-OUL station pair may also provide some\nevidence in support of a two-stage refilling process.Lawrence\net al. [1999] and Su et al. [2001] statistically studied data from\nthe Magnetospheric Plasma Analyzers on board several Los\nAlamos geosynchronous satellites and found evidence for a\ntwo-stage refilling process, the rate of refilling during the first\n24 hours (\u2018\u2018early-time refilling\u2019\u2019) being slower than the\nfollowing days (\u2018\u2018late-time refilling\u2019\u2019). These studies\nshowed early-time refilling rates at geosynchronous orbit\nof 0.6\u201312 ions cm\u00013 day\u00011 and late-time refilling rates\nof 10\u201325 ions cm\u00013 day\u00011. Using the above dipolar flux\ntube cross-section method to compare these geosynchro-\nnous results to those at L = 4.12 gives an early-time\nrefilling rate of 4\u201380 ions cm\u00013 day\u00011 and a late-time\nrefilling rate of 67\u2013166 ions cm\u00013 day\u00011. These results\ncompare well with our morning sector results but not so\nwell with the afternoon sector ones. Note that if the\nheavy ion population decreased throughout the refilling\ninterval, as implied by the data presented in Figure 8 for\n14 and 17 May, then the rate in terms of ions cm\u00013 day\u00011\ndetermined using observed plasma mass densities will be\nartificially low.\n[58] Note that Su et al. [2001] began their refilling rate\ncalculation when the Kp index fell to 1+ or lower and\ncontinued as long as this condition was met. This condition\nwas not met through our refilling interval, however, al-\nthough it is clear that such a low Kp value is not required\nbefore refilling is observed at L = 4.12.\n[59] To explain this two-stage refilling process, Lawrence\net al. [1999] suggested a scenario modeled by Wilson et al.\n[1992] where Coulomb collisions may be the dominant\ntrapping mechanism, and once some critical density is\nreached then the refilling rate will increase. Wilson et al.\u2019s\n[1992] model showed the change from early- to late-time\nrefilling occurred at some specific density and that this\ntransition was also accompanied by a change from field-\naligned to isotropic ion distributions.\n[60] This two-stage refilling scenario is not supported by\nother authors, however. Park [1970], for example, moni-\ntored refilling of electrons in the midnight sector and at L-\nshells between 3.5 and 5.0 using ground-based whistler\nobservations. He observed the whistler duct plasma content\nto increase at a nearly constant rate during 5 extremely quiet\ndays, after which the refilling rate decreased. Note that our\nresults have shown that local time is an important factor\nwhen monitoring poststorm refilling, and Singh and Horwitz\n[1992] note that the initial plasma content in a flux tube is an\nimportant factor for subsequent refilling. These factors may\nexplain this disagreement.\n[61] Along the RPI determined plasma mass density\nprofile for 14 May 2001, shown in Figure 8, a small-scale\ndensity depletion occurs between L = 2.27 and 2.57. This is\nnot apparent along the cross-phase determined profile but\nmay be explained by the spacing of the ground-based\nmagnetometer pair, which spans L = 2.25\u20132.56. Menk et\nal. [2004] discussed in detail the ability to detect localized\nmagnetospheric density structures using the cross-phase and\nrelated techniques. Such small-scale plasmaspheric deple-\ntions are not uncommon and Lemaire et al. [1998] note that\nsuch depletions and their subsequent recovery have been\nobserved since the early 1960s. Clilverd et al. [2000]\nstudied 10 years worth of VLF data and found that depletion\nevents occurred within 3 days of the Kp index reaching 5 or\nmore were centered about L = 2.4, and the majority of these\ndepletions occurred within the plasmasphere, in excellent\nagreement with the RPI observations shown in Figure 8.\nUsing measurements made on board the ISEE satellite\n[Carpenter and Lemaire, 1997] also observed regions of\nelectron density depletion in the inner plasmasphere follow-\ning geomagnetic disturbances. Possible scenarios to explain\nthese depletions include outward moving flux tubes [e.g.,\nSmith and Clilverd, 1991] and loss to the ionosphere [e.g.,\nCarpenter and Lemaire, 1997].\n5. Conclusions\n[62] In this paper we have presented ground-based mag-\nnetometer cross-phase and IMAGE satellite in situ RPI\nA03205 DENT ET AL.: PLASMASPHERIC DEPLETION AND REFILLING\n12 of 14\nA03205\nmonitoring of plasma depletion and refilling throughout a\nprolonged interval of moderate geomagnetic activity be-\ntween 5 and 17 May 2001. During this interval a series of\nexcellent ground-satellite conjunctions also occurred, en-\nabling heavy ion dynamics to be inferred. In addition,\nIMAGE EUVand empirical model determined plasmapause\nlocations were analyzed for the same interval.\n[63] Plasmaspheric erosion to L < 3 was monitored\nfollowing the onset of a geomagnetic storm on 7 May,\nand again to a higher L-shell during an interval of renewed\nactivity which occurred during the recovery phase on\n12 May. Plasma loss took place for more than 3 days\nfollowing the first depletion episode and plasma refilling\nwas clearly observed for several days following the second\ndepletion interval. Refilling rates determined from the cross-\nphase results for L = 4.12 for the morning sector and using\nthe daily maximum observed plasma mass density showed\ndifferent trends, implying that refilling along an assumed\ncorotating flux tube does not proceed at a uniform rate\nthrough the dayside sector, or from day to day.\n[64] Good agreement was found between the cross-phase\nand IMAGE EUV and RPI observations, particularly with\nrespect to the dynamic motion of the plasmapause. Empir-\nical plasmapause models showed reasonable agreement\nwith the EUV determined plasmapause locations, the Orr\nand Webb [1975] (OW75) model showing better agreement\nduring quieter times and the O\u2019Brien and Moldwin [2003]\n(OBM03) model showing better agreement during more\nactive times. The OBM03 plasmapause estimates were\nconsistently at lower L-shells than those of the OW75\nmodel, and this is due to the differing plasmapause identi-\nfication criteria for the two models.\n[65] The cross-phase and IMAGE RPI conjunction study\nshowed that the presence of heavy ions may be inferred\nwhen ground-based magnetometer and in situ satellite\ndetermined mass density profiles diverge, but one must\nfirst discount the presence of azimuthal density asymmetry\nas the cause of the difference between the two density\nprofiles.\n[66] This study demonstrates and further illuminates the\nutility of multiinstrument studies for monitoring the dynam-\nics of the plasma populations in the inner magnetosphere\nincluding plasmaspheric motion and heavy ion injection. In\nfuture, using ground-based magnetometers along more than\none meridian would add insight into the issue of the effect\nof local time history on plasma depletion and global plasma-\nspheric morphology.\n[67] Acknowledgments.
