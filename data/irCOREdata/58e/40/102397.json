Introduction\nD ISTRIBUTED video coding (DVC) is an emerging videocoding approach, particularly attractive due to its flexibil-\nity for building extremely simple and low cost video encoders.\nThis feature could be very effectively exploited in several\napplication domains including wireless sensor networks for\nsecurity surveillance and mobile video communications, where\nthe conventional video coding technologies with highly com-\nputational intensive algorithms become weak candidates.\nIt is a common scenario to deploy wireless networks for\nvideo surveillance networks, where the adverse effects of\nchannel noise and time varying multipath fading on the recon-\nstructed video quality are a significant problem.

This letter considers this fading wireless channel\nscenario and modifies the DVC decoding algorithm to enhance\nthe error resilience of the transform domain DVC codec.\nThis discussion is based on a DVC codec that follows the\nStanford framework [2] with turbo coding, where the Wyner\u2013\nZiv coded bit stream and the key frame stream traverses the\ncommunication channel. Thus the effects of the channel errors\non both these streams are considered herein. Appropriate noise\nmodels will be developed for each component at the decoder\nand the suitable compensative solutions will be proposed.\nII. System Overview\nThe consideredtransform domain DVC codec architecture\n[3] with the WCDMA wireless channel simulation system is\npresented in this section. A block diagram of the system is\nshown in Fig. 1. The DVC encoder generates the punctured\nparity bit stream (Wyner\u2013Ziv coded bit stream) [3] that is\ntransmitted over the fading wireless channel. As shown in\nFig. 1, a quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) modulator\nand a demodulator with a built-in rake receiver are used in\nthe transmitting and receiving nodes of the wireless channel,\nrespectively.\nIn wireless communications, it is common to use a discrete\ntime Rayleigh fading channel model consisting of multiple\nnarrow-band channel paths separated by delay elements. With\nthese channel models, it is common in communication sys-\ntems to use rake receivers to improve the performance by\ncollecting the energy dispersed over multiple fading paths.\nIf Ri(t) and Y(t) correspond to the inputs and the output\nof the rake receiver and G1,G2, . . . ,GN are the complex\nfading coefficients of each path, the output of the rake receiver\nY (t) with respect to signals received from N fading paths is\ncomputed as\nRi(t) =\nN\u2211\nj=1\n(\nGjX (t + 2 \u2212 i \u2212 j)\n)\n+ n(t)\u2200i \u2208 {1, 2, ..., N}\nY (t) =\nN\u2211\ni=1\nG\u2217i Ri\n1051-8215\/$26.00 c\u00a9 2009 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

The parity\nbit streams (ypk ) for the decoder are taken from the soft output\nof the channel. The systematic component (ysk) is taken from\nthe side information stream. The channel reliability factor (LC)\nfor the parity stream is derived from channel estimation in a\npractical implementation. For the simulations discussed in this\nletter, perfect channel estimation is assumed for the wireless\nchannel. Any channel estimation algorithm proposed in the\nliterature, such as [4], can be utilized for this purpose.\nIII. Proposed Solution\nIn this section, we present the mathematical design of the\nnovel noise model for the systematic and parity bit streams to\nbe used in iterative MAP decoding of Wyner\u2013Ziv frames in\nDVC.\nThe conditional log likelihood ratio (LLR) L(uk|yk) of the\ndata bit uk is defined as [5]\nL(uk|yk) = ln\n(\nP(uk = +1)|yk\nP(uk = \u22121)|yk\n)\n(2)\nwhere yk is the received parity information. Incorporating the\ncode\u2019s trellis, this may be written as\nL(uk) = ln\n\u239b\n\u239d\n\u2211\ns+\np(sk\u22121 = s\u2032, sk = s, y)\/p(y)\u2211\ns\u2212\np(sk\u22121 = s\u2032, sk = s, y)\/p(y)\n\u239e\n\u23a0 (3)\nwhere sk \u2208 S is the state of the encoder at time instance\nk, S+ is the set of ordered pairs (s\u2032, s) corresponding to all\nstate transitions (sk\u22121 = s\u2032) \u2192 (sk = s) caused by data input\nuk = +1,and S\u2212 is similarly defined for uk = \u22121.\nFrom the BCJR algorithm,\np(s\u2032, s, y) = p(sk\u22121 = s\u2032, sk = s, y), is computed as\np(s\u2032, s, y) = \u03b1k\u22121(s\u2032) \u00b7 \u03b3k(s\u2032, s) \u00b7 \u03b2k(s) (4)\nwhere \u03b1k(s) and \u03b2k(s) are the forward and backward trellis\nstate probabilities respectively, and \u03b3k(s\u2032, s) is the state transi-\ntion probability, defined as follows:\n\u03b1k(s) = \u03b1k\u22121(v1) \u03b3k(v1, s) + \u03b1k\u22121(v2) \u03b3k(v2, s) (5)\n\u03b2k(s) = \u03b2k+1(w1) \u03b3k+1(w1, s) + \u03b2k+1(w2) \u03b3k+1(w2, s) (6)\n\u03b3k(s\u2032, s) = P(s|s\u2032)p(yk|s\u2032, s)\n= P(uk)p(yk|uk) (7)\nwhere v1 and v2 denote valid previous states and w1 and w2\ndenote valid next states for the current state.\nIt is reminded that, in the case of DVC, the parity stream\nfor the turbo decoder is transmitted over a noisy wireless\nchannel and the systematic stream is taken from the side\ninformation frame locally generated at the decoder which\nassumes a hypothetical Laplacian noise model. But in real\nworld scenarios, both the transmitted parity and the intra coded\nkey frame information suffer the same noisy wireless channel\nconditions. Thus, under practical situations, the effects of\ncorrupted parity information, corrupted intra coded key frame\ninformation, and the hypothetical channel characteristics have\nbeen considered in our discussion.\nConsidering the noise distribution in parity and systematic\ncomponents of the input to the turbo decoder to be indepen-\ndent, p(yk|uk) in (7) can be written as\np(yk|uk) = p(ypk |upk )p(ysk|usk) (8)\nwhere yk = {ypk , ysk}, uk = {upk , usk} are the received and\ntransmitted parity and systematic information respectively.\nThe mathematical modeling of received parity, and systematic\ninformation are elaborated in the following subsections.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

(c) Experimentally observed overall noise in side information, h(x).\nA. Modeling the Parity Information\nFor the parity bit sequence received through a multipath\nfading wireless channel, the probability of the received bit ypk\nconditioned on the transmitted bit upk can be written as\np(ypk |upk = \u00b11) =\nEb\u221a\n2\u03c0\u03c32\nexp\n\u239b\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u2212[ypk \u2213\nN\u2211\ni=1\n|ai|2]2\n2\u03c32\n\u239e\n\u239f\u239f\u23a0 (9)\nwhere ai is the complex fading coefficient, \u03c3 is the standard\ndeviation in the Gaussian probability distribution, Eb is the\nenergy per bit, i is the path index, and N is the total number\nof multipaths.\nThe conditional LLR for parity information L(ypk |xpk ) can\nbe written as\nL(ypk |xpk ) = ln\n(\nP(ypk |xpk = +1)\nP(ypk |xpk = \u22121)\n)\n.

Modeling the Systematic Information\nUnder the error free transmission of intra coded key frames,\nthe correlation of the original Wyner\u2013Ziv frames to be encoded\nand the estimated side information is assumed to be Laplacian\ndistributed as\nf (x) = \u03b1\n2\nexp(\u2212\u03b1|ysk \u2212 usk|) (12)\nwhere \u03b1 is the distribution parameter. But experimentally\nwe have found that in the presence of a noisy wireless\nchannel, the correlation between the estimated side informa-\ntion and the original information no longer exhibits a true\nLaplacian behavior for the DC band of the DCT coefficients,\neven though the distributions of the AC bands can still\nbe approximated as a Laplacian model. With the loss of\ninformation due to channel conditions, the new noise pdf\nof the DC band [denoted as h(x) in Fig. 2(c)] is identified\nas the resultant additive effect of the original pdf of the\nDC band and the above Laplacian distribution, f(x). This\nphenomenon is illustrated for Foreman test video sequence\nin Fig. 2. Tests were performed for a set of more than ten\nstandard test video sequences and consistent results were\nobserved. Thus, the conditional probability, p(ysk|usk) in (8),\nis derived from this additive channel model. However, the\noriginal DC coefficients of the encoded sequence for the cur-\nrent Wyner\u2013Ziv frames are not available at the DVC decoder.\nTherefore, the pdf of the DC band distribution is estimated\nat the DVC decoder using the previously decoded Wyner\u2013\nZiv frame and is continuously updated during the decoding\nprocess.\nThus the conditional probabilities, p(ysk|usk), calculated by\nmodeling the side information, and p(ypk |upk ), calculated by\nmodeling the parity information, as discussed in Section A,\nare used in (8) and the result is used in (7) to calculate the\nbranch metric \u03b3k(s\u2032, s).\nNow, the SISO decoder is modified incorporating the pro-\nposed noise models for the MAP decoding algorithm as\nderived above. This modified turbo decoder is incorporated\ninto the existing DVC decoder architecture [3].\nWhen simulating the channel noise for the intra coded\nkey frames transmitted over identical channel, the decoded\nkey frames are too degraded for use as reference frames for\nside information estimation. Therefore, a channel coder [6] is\nincorporated into the intra codec in key frame coding. A low\ncomplex channel encoder [rate: 1\/3, generator matrix G(D)=\n[1 1\/(1 + D)]] is chosen not to overburden the DVC encoder\nand suitable channel encoders are incorporated, for both I and\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

This\nassumption is justified by the very small bit rate utilized in\nthe reverse channel and the possibility of building very strong\nerror correction coding to protect it using the sufficiently\navailable reverse channel bandwidth, in a common symmetric\nbi-directional channel.\nIV. Simulation Results\nSimulations results of the DVC codec with the proposed\nmodifications are discussed in this section. The test conditions\nare first explained followed by an analysis of results.\nA. Test Conditions\nThe common test conditions used for all simulations are\nlisted here. Specific conditions adopted in each analysis sce-\nnario are described in the following sections.\n1) Three test video sequences are selected to represent\ndifferent motion activity levels. Soccer: high motion,\nForeman: medium motion, and Hall Monitor: low\nmotion.\n2) Frame format: YUV 4:2:0, resolution: QCIF\n(176 \u00d7 144), frame rate: 30 frames\/s, no. of coded\nframes: 100, GOP: 2.\n3) The transform (DCT) coefficients are quantized using\nthe quantization matrices in [3].\n4) Key frames are H.264\/AVC Intra coded with the quanti-\nzation parameter (QP) optimized for each rate-distortion\n(RD) point for comparable picture quality in Wyner\u2013Ziv\nand key frames.\n5) The PSNR is calculated for the luminance component.\n6) H.264\/AVC codec [7] is simulated in IBIB GOP struc-\nture (JM10.1\/Main profile) for identical channel condi-\ntions. Here, a channel coder identical to that used for\nintra coding the key frames, as described in Section III,\nis used.\n7) For both H.264\/AVC and DVC codecs, the PSNR and\nbit rates are calculated for both intra coded and inter\ncoded frames. The channel coding overhead bit rate is\naccounted.\n8) A W-CDMA wireless channel is used for all simulations\nas summarized in Table I. A slow fading channel is\nconsidered to closely resemble a practical scenario.\nB. Analysis of Results\nThe simulation results are analyzed in the next sections for\nthe effects of proposed noise models, effects of channel coder\nselection for key frame coding, and the effects of the multiple\nfading paths, followed by a comparison with the state of the\nart in conventional video coding.\nC. Effects of Noise Models\nThe performance of the proposed solution with respect to\neach modification (i.e., parity and side information) is shown\nTABLE I\nConfiguration Parameters of the W-CDMA Channel\nChannel model W-CDMA uplink and downlink channels\n(slowly-varying freq.-selective fading)\nModulation QPSK\nChip rate 3.84 Mchip\/s\nSpreading factor 32\nSpreading sequence OVSF sequences\nCarrier freq. 2 GHz\nDopper speed 100 km\/h\nFig. 3.

It is observed that the\nDVC codec RD performance is improved by each individual\nmodification. First, the proposed models for the parity (Wyner\u2013\nZiv bit stream) and systematic (side information) bit streams\nhave been applied separately to verify the performance. The\nplots in Fig. 3 are described here in the order of performance\nimprovement (bottom to top).\n1) The original result without the proposed modifications.\n2) The proposed model applied for the systematic (side\ninformation) bit stream only. The parity bit stream\n(Wyner\u2013Ziv bit stream) noise model is not used. Here,\nup to 0.6 dB gain in PSNR is observed for the same bit\nrate when compared with the no-model result.\n3) The proposed noise model applied only for the parity\nbit stream (Wyner\u2013Ziv bit stream). Noise model for\nsystematic bit stream is not used. Here, a PSNR gain\nof up to 1.5 dB is evident compared with the no-model\nresult.\n4) Both proposed noise models applied. An overall PSNR\ngain of up to 2 dB is evident here.\nPerformance of the proposed model with the Hall Monitor and\nSoccer sequences is shown in Figs. 4 and 5 where a PSNR gain\nof up to 2 dB is evident when both parity and systematic bit\nmodels are incorporated. Thus, the observations for the three\ndifferent sequences are consistent proving that the positive gain\nof the proposed modification comes irrespective of the motion\nlevel in the video content.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Effects of Channel Coder Selection for Key Frame Coding\nFigs. 6 and 7 illustrate the effect of channel errors on the\nH.264\/AVC Intra coded key frames. The overall performance\nof the codec is particularly sensitive to the quality of the key\nframes used in the generation of side information. Since a\nchannel coder is utilized to protect the intra coded bit stream\nas discussed in Section III, this is effectively an analysis of\nthe effect of channel coder selection on the proposed model.\nIn Fig. 6, the intra coded frames are more protected using a\nstronger channel coder (code rate of \u00bc), thus enabling error\nfree transmission. The other extreme scenario with highly\nFig. 7. Highly noisy key frames using a weak channel code for intra coding\n(channel SNR = 3 dB), Foreman.\nFig. 8. RD results for single path in fading model (channel SNR = 3 dB),\nForeman.\ncorrupted intra frames as a result of less protection in using\na very weak channel coder (code rate of \u00bd) is illustrated in\nFig. 7. From Figs. 6 and 7, it is evident that a significant\nperformance gain could be achieved through the proposed\nmodifications irrespective of the key frame quality. It further\nquantifies the effect of the choice of channel coder, which is\na compromise in terms of the overhead bit rate as well as the\nprocessing complexity.\nE. Effects of the Multiple Fading Paths\nThe verification of the proposed model for the multi-\npath fading channel model is further extended by varying\nthe number of transmission paths for a single path and a\n4-path case. Simulation results are shown in Figs. 8 and 9,\nrespectively, for the single path and 4-path fading channels\nand it is evident that the performance improvement from the\nproposed modifications is consistent for each case.\nF. Comparison with the State-of-the-Art (H.264\/AVC)\nFinally, the results of the proposed model are compared\nwith the state-of-the-art H.264\/AVC codec (with default er-\nror concealment), for different channel SNR values. From\nthe results presented in Fig. 10, it is evident that the pro-\nposed DVC codec demonstrates a very reliable and consistent\nperformance over various channel conditions. It is further\nnoted that the H.264\/AVC codec is very sensitive to adverse\nchannel conditions. The low complex channel encoder [rate:\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Accordingly, suitable\nnew channel coders (only for H.264\/AVC) were empirically\ndetermined for different SNR levels (for SNR = 3 dB: code rate\n= 1\/3, G(D) = [1 (1 + D + D2 + D3)\/(1 + D + D3)], for SNR\n= 5 dB: code rate = 1\/3, G(D) = [1 (1 + D2)\/(1 + D + D2)]\nand for SNR = 9 dB: code rate = 1\/3, G(D) = [1 1\/(1 + D2)].\nNote here that the use of larger constraint lengths means\nsignificantly increased coding complexity. This approach was\nchosen over increasing the code rate (e.g., \u00bc) to keep the\noverall bit rate at a minimum.\nThe fact that the DVC codec with the proposed noise\nmodel gives very reliable performance at minimal cost of\nchannel coding yields very promising prospects for the target\napplications discussed earlier in the introduction. This is,\nparticulary, significant since many of those applications are\nimplemented over a multipath fading wireless channel.\nV. Conclusion\nIn this letter, novel noise models are proposed for a DVC\ncodec and the decoder is accordingly modified for the use\non noisy wireless channels. The performance of the proposed\nmodifications is verified for a W-CDMA wireless channel\nwith multipath fading. The simulation results clearly show\nthat the two proposed noise models for the parity (Wyner\u2013Ziv\nbit stream) and systematic (side information) bit streams have\nresulted in a significant gain in the RD performance of the\ncodec when operated over noisy and fading channel condi-\ntions. The improvement is proven to be significant irrespective\nof the motion level in the video content, the conditions of the\nfading channel or the transmission accuracy of the key frames.\nDue to its very stable and consistent behavior, DVC even\noutperforms the H.264\/AVC codec when the channel effects\nare adverse. Furthermore, it is noted that these results are\nobtained with no additional complexity burden to the already\nextremely low complex DVC encoder.\nReferences\n[1] J. Pedro, L. Ducla Soares, C.
