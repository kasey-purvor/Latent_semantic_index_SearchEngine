This is assumed to reflect conceptual divisions inher-\nent in Amazonian cosmologies and elucidated by researchers with different analytical\nfoci: some researchers are concerned with the (often) male world of shamanism, its\nunderlying cosmology, and the meaning behind specific healing rituals (e.g., Briggs\n1994; Green 1998), whereas others are concerned with the (often) female world of\npractical, symptom-based therapy in which medicinal plants play a prominent role\n(e.g., Browner 1991; Shepard 2004; Wayland 2001). This, then, sets up two do-\nmains within the larger domain of \u201clocal medical knowledge\u201d that can be analyzed\nin opposition to biomedicine, Christianity, and other exogenous institutions.\nThe complex relationship between biomedicine and medicinal plant knowledge\n(Wayland 2003) and the role of shamanism in mediating the drastic socioeconomic\nchanges of the late 20th century (Taussig 1987) have been subjected to valuable\nscrutiny. However, neither the relationship between medicinal plants and shaman-\nism nor the role of medicinal plants in this period of socioeconomic change has been\nMEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY, Vol. 21, Issue 1, pp. 41\u201363, ISSN 0745-5194,\nonline ISSN 1548-1387.

By considering all these healing domains together, I find evi-\ndence of previously undescribed interactions; for instance, in this case, biomedicine\nencourages the use of herbal medicines, while the deeply embedded and spiritual na-\nture of shamanism may have discouraged their use. Furthermore, by considering not\nonly whether or not medicinal plants as a general category are known or used but\nalso which plants are used, how they are used, and in what contexts, I find evidence\nof a profound shift in Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc conceptions of illness and correlated treatment-\nseeking behavior, thereby demonstrating the contribution that ethnobotanical data\nmay make to medical anthropology.\nMedicinal Plant Use in Amazonia\nThe shamanism\u2013medicinal plant dichotomy is illustrated by the Yanomami case.\nEarly claims that the Yanomami did not use medicinal plants (Chagnon 1968:52)\nor, as Biocca (1979) claims, were \u201cignorant\u201d of them (Milliken and Albert 1996:11)\nwere rebutted when Milliken and Albert published an inventory of 113 medici-\nnal plant species collected from one community alone. Their (Milliken and Albert\n1996:13) explanation for the acknowledged rarity of the use of these medicinal\nplants is the introduction of biomedicines, which were uniquely effective against\nintroduced epidemics. They (Milliken and Albert 1996:14) also blame epidemics for\na knowledge bottleneck in which many of the primary medicinal plant practitioners\n(i.e., older women) died without passing on the bulk of their knowledge. However,\nnote the distinction between Chagnon\u2019s claim that medicinal plants were not used\nand Milliken and Albert\u2019s claim that they were known. Milliken and Albert admit\nthat medicinal plant use was rare and that knowledge was in a \u201cprecarious state\u201d in\nwhich most of the knowledge documented \u201cwas that which a few of the older men\nhad picked up from their mothers and grandmothers\u201d (1996:11, 14).\nThe development of ideas about medicinal plants in Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc ethnography runs\nparallel to the Yanomami case. Most ethnographers writing before 1995 fail to\nmention herbal medicines at all (Bogla\u00b4r 1971, 1982; Mansutti 1988; Monod 1970,\n1987; Oldham 1997; Overing and Kaplan 1988; Overing-Kaplan 1975:236), and\nAnduze states that \u201cthe [Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc] have a profound understanding of the environ-\nment that surrounds them . . . . However, . . . in certain aspects they are deficient: in\ntheir knowledge of medicinal plants for example\u201d (1974:113). This claim was chal-\nlenged by Zent, who published an account of 114 plant taxa of \u201cmedicinal use\u201d that\nthe Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc of the Upper Cuao River \u201crecognized\u201d (1997:340).\nA large proportion of those herbal remedies address highly salient symptoms such\nas stings and venomous bites, diarrhea, cough and sore throat, minor cuts, and der-\nmatological problems (Zent 1997:341). Zent (1997:340) explains that the oversight\nof previous ethnographers reflects an emic distinction between two Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc treat-\nment categories: shamanism and herbalism. The curing techniques used by shamans\nare only known by a few men and are considered to be arcane. Herbalism is consid-\nered to be profane and general knowledge, obtained through decades of informal,\nexperiential learning. Again, however, there is an implicit distinction between know-\ning a plant and using it: Zent (1992:103) states elsewhere that shamanism is consid-\nered to be the most fundamental and efficacious of the two treatment categories\u2014the\nWo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc Medicine and Cultural Change 43\nfirst recourse when someone falls ill\u2014whereas herbalism is only resorted to if and\nwhen shamanism is not effective.\nThis sentiment is echoed by Milliken and Albert, who state that shamanism is\n\u201cindisputably the most evident and the most important aspect of [Yanomami] tradi-\ntional healing\u201d (1996:10\u201311). This is in direct contrast with my own observations\namong the Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc, where use of plant medicines was frequent and often the first\ncourse of action, whereas shamanism was infrequent and often a last resort. This\ncontrast was especially surprising because the Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc with whom I worked were\nmore integrated into the national society: not only did they have easier access to\nbiomedicine, but they demonstrated significantly less general knowledge of forest\nplants than the inhabitants of the Upper Cuao River would be expected to demon-\nstrate (Heckler 2002; Zent 2001).\nThe Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc\nThe Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc (Piaroa) are usually placed in the Sa\u00b4livan language group (Krute\n1988:322), which is unaffiliated with most of the neighboring ethnic groups, includ-\ning the Yanomami and the Yabarana. The most recent census estimates the number\nof Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc to be between 12,000 and 13,000, living primarily in Amazonas State,\nVenezuela, but with a few hundred in Boliva\u00b4r State, Venezuela, and on the left bank\nof the Orinoco in Colombia.\nDemographic Change\nSince the 1950s, the Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc, like other indigenous groups in the Venezuelan Ama-\nzon, have been integrating into the national culture (Mansutti 1988, 1995). Govern-\nment programs have greatly encouraged this integration by establishing sedentary\ncommunities with ready-built concrete-block houses, schools, medical clinics, and\naccess to markets along navigable rivers throughout indigenous territories (Perera\n1995). This has had a profound effect on Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc demographics. In 1970, it was\nestimated that there were 4,000 Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc living primarily in widely dispersed semi-\nnomadic groups in an inaccessible upland region (Anduze 1974). Today, very few\nWo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc remain in the headwater regions of their homeland. These \u201cheadwater\u201d\nWo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc are said by the riverine Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc to live como adenante (lit., \u201cas before\u201d),\nwith little contact with criollos and minimal access to schools, biomedical health\ncare, markets, and state politics.1 Today, the majority live in settled, mapped com-\nmunities along navigable rivers, including barrios within multiethnic communities\n(Oficina Central de Estad\u0131\u00b4stica e Informa\u00b4tica [OCEI] 1995; Zent 2001:192). Gov-\nernment officials, including health and education specialists, visit most or all of these\nsettlements regularly.\nThis marked and dramatic shift in demography and orientation is reflected in a\ngeneral division in the Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc ethnography. Before 1995, it focuses on headwa-\nter Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc (e.g., Bogla\u00b4r 1971, 1982; Monod 1970, 1987; Overing 1981, 1989;\nOvering-Kaplan 1975; Zent 1992; for an exception to this, see Mansutti 1988,\n1990); ethnography published after 1995 is more concerned with the consequences\nof the demographic change (e.g., Freire 2002; Heckler 2001; Melnyk 1995:331;\nOldham 1996; Zent 2001). Health is a major contributor to this demographic shift.\n44 Medical Anthropology Quarterly\nIndeed, one of the primary reasons given by the Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc with whom I spoke for\nmoving from interfluvial to riverine communities was to seek medical treatment.\nHeadwater Shamanism\nA recurring theme in Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc ethnography is the importance of a certain kind of\n\u201cessential force\u201d (Oldham 1997:232) or \u201cproductive power\u201d (Overing 1989) that\noriginally stems from the gods and flows through the forest and through people. It\nis responsible for the production of game animals, fish, crops, and babies; without\nit, life is impossible, but it can overwhelm people and become a negative force.\nIndeed, most illness episodes are attributed to improper or unmediated contact with\nforest beings allowing an improper flow of productive power (Oldham 1997:230;\nOvering and Kaplan 1988:397\u2013398). The shaman\u2019s role is not only to intervene in\neach illness episode as it occurs but also to understand and mediate the flow of this\nproductive power. They do this through a variety of activities, including removing\na shamanic \u201cdart\u201d that has been embedded by witchcraft in the patient\u2019s body (see\nalso Oldham 1997), performing rituals to rid bad feelings that cause illness and\nhysteria in entire communities, or singing to maintain properly social relations with\nthe animals, spirits, and gods that populate the cosmological landscape (Bogla\u00b4r 1971;\nOvering 1989:168\u2013171). Zent (1992:289\u2013290), in his detailed time-allocation study\nof the Upper Cuao Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc, reports that this singing is the most common shamanic\nactivity, occurring every night.\nA resident shaman is necessary to protect people from unmediated contact and\nimproper use of this productive power. Because shamans are so close to the pro-\nductive power, they have the potential to be particularly dangerous and must be\nmade safe by engaging them in properly domestic exchange relationships, namely,\nsharing daily activities, eating, and working together with families (Overing 1981).\nThe end result is that virtually all headwater communities consist of a shaman with\nan extended family group living in a single roundhouse (Overing-Kaplan 1975).\nBut shamans have another role that is only beginning to be appreciated by ethno-\ngraphers. Beginning with Santos-Granero (1991) but crystallizing in the important\nvolume edited by Overing and Passes (2000), a radical rethinking of Amazonian\nsociety has forced a conclusion that \u201cthe intimate, informal relationships of the ev-\neryday [are] the primary concern of most Amazonian peoples and take up most of\ntheir time and energy\u201d (Overing and Passes 2000:9). Amazonists are increasingly\nrecognizing that the healthiest community is the one in which everyday activities are\ncarried out in a context of tranquil, intimate relationships, a lifestyle that indigenous\nAmazonians often refer to as \u201cliving well\u201d (Belaunde 2001; Gow 2000:52).\nCaring for children, working a garden, and sharing these activities with other\nfamily members, rather than being \u201ctoo unimportant\u201d for prominent persons such\nas shamans, are the necessary foundations of a healthy and productive community.\nIn sharing domestic duties, shamans fulfill important functions that enhance the\nproper development of their communities and demonstrate that they have not been\ndriven mad by their nighttime activities and so will not use their power to harm those\naround them (Overing 2003:298\u2013302, 309\u2013310). Hence, shamans\u2019 roles as ritual\nhealers do not preclude their importance as alloparents, kinsmen, and community\nmembers. In fact, shamans are fully embedded in the family unit: they constantly\nWo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc Medicine and Cultural Change 45\nand casually interact with community members, and, crucially for the discussion\nhere, they are included in normal discussions about minor illness episodes as they\noccur. As a result, shamans generally become involved in illness episodes very early\non, largely superseding the role of the \u201cinformal healer\u201d that exists elsewhere (e.g.,\nFinerman 1989). Furthermore, these illness episodes are often seen as symptoms of\nunderlying problems with the productive power and affective state of the patient;\nhence, if a shaman is on hand\u2014which, in a headwater community, he almost always\nwill be\u2014herbal medicines are deemed largely unnecessary.\nI was regularly told that shamans are the most knowledgeable about all types of\nplants, but there is little evidence, either in the literature or in my own research, of\nWo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc shamans using medicinal plants. Although shamans use particular plants\nfor rituals, including Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) and Anadenanthera peregrina\n(yopo), these plants are not usually used by the patient and do not treat symptoms\nbut, rather, initiate and maintain trance.\nThe picture that emerges from the pre-1995 literature and corroborated by\nmy own interviews with shamans and laypeople about life \u201cin the forest\u201d (Wo\u02dct.\nyo, de\u2019ana) or \u201cbefore\u201d (como adenante) is a medical system largely controlled\nby shamans, with evidence of limited, nonspiritual, symptom-specific treatment,\nnamely, medicinal plants, being applied by older men or women as supplements to\nthe primary treatment. To document how illness cosmology has changed and to bet-\nter understand how it relates to changes in other aspects of Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc life, I collected\nthree data sets, two quantitative and one qualitative.\nMethods\nThe quantitative and qualitative data were collected during a comparative study\nof three communities, supplemented by surveys of six others carried out between\n1997 and 1999, with a follow-up visit in 2004. Seven of these communities are in\nthe Manapiare municipality; the other two are near and in the state capital, Puerto\nAyacucho. San Juan de Manapiare, Guara, and Can\u02dco Seje are located along the upper\nreaches of the Manapiare River Valley; some of the residents are related to each\nother and visit each other regularly, a situation typical of all Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc communities.\nHowever, certain key factors relating to their interaction with the national culture\nare different.\nThe Communities\nThree general categories of Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc settlement emerged from the survey I con-\nducted: (1) \u201ctraditional,\u201d that is, small (<60 residents) and isolated, founded and\nconstructed by the residents, and operating an almost entirely subsistence econ-\nomy; (2) government-built, indigenous communities, usually larger than traditional\ncommunities (30\u2013300 residents), with concrete-block houses, primary schools, and\nsometimes clinics, often with airstrips, roads, or large ports, included in government\ndevelopment programs; and (3) neighborhoods or communities within larger mul-\ntiethnic towns, usually economic hubs, often run by nonindigenous governments.\nThe three communities highlighted in this study were chosen as representatives of\neach of these categories.\n46 Medical Anthropology Quarterly\nCan\u02dco Seje is relatively isolated (some 30 kilometers upriver from San Juan) and\nethnically unmixed, with a population of approximately 30 people organized along\nkinship lines and a shaman as patriarch. Only three in-marrying members of the\ncommunity spoke Spanish with any degree of competency. The residents lived in four\npalm-roofed houses clustered together, and they cooked, ate, hunted, gardened, and\nrested together. Although a small amount of cacao (Theobroma cacao) was traded\nvia the regional agricultural cooperative, direct involvement with criollo society\nwas minimal. There was no land pressure and no direct encouragement to remain\nsedentary. All of these features indicate that Can\u02dco Seje, despite its contact with\nSan Juan and periodic visitors, maintains a typically Guyanese social and economic\nstructure (see Overing 1981; Rivie`re 1984); as such, it can be used, with care, as a\nproxy for headwater communities.\nThe community of Guara is located seven kilometers south of San Juan. The\nmajority of residents lived in small concrete-block houses that were built by the gov-\nernment in the 1970s. At the time of my study, all but two of the approximately 50\nresidents were Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc. Guara had a primary school and was successfully involved\nwith a regional agricultural cooperative, sending cacao, plantains (Musa spp.), and\ncattle downriver to the state capital in exchange for manufactured goods, biomed-\nical treatment, and transport. Because of its proximity to San Juan, there was no\nhealth clinic or paranurse in Guara, but it did receive regular visits from government\nagencies, including three from the agency for malaria control during my stay. Ap-\nproximately 25\u201330 percent of the community spoke some Spanish, and many of the\nolder children were sent to San Juan or Puerto Ayacucho to continue their school-\ning. There was no full-time shaman in the community, the captain being Evangelical,\nalthough illness episodes were sometimes blamed on forest spirits. Unlike the case\nin San Juan, there was no land pressure, and residents regularly visited the nearby\nlarge tracts of mature forest.\nSan Juan is the economic and political hub for the region, with about 1,000\npeople from at least 13 different ethnic groups (Centro Amazo\u00b4nico para la Inves-\ntigacio\u00b4n y Control de Enfermedades Tropicales 1997). It has a Catholic mission,\nan Evangelical church, a small hospital, shops, electricity, running water, and daily\nflights to the state capital. Most of the Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc residents of San Juan (approxi-\nmately 110) live in the same neighborhood (lit., \u201cbarrio Piaroa\u201d), which was es-\ntablished in the 1960s. Most Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc residents of San Juan claimed to be Evan-\ngelical or Catholic. As a hub, San Juan attracts people from all over the region,\nand the Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc residents of San Juan have resettled from a variety of outly-\ning communities since the 1950s. The kinship networks maintained with these\ncommunities have important implications for the transmission of ethnobotanical\nknowledge.\nAt the time of my fieldwork, no shaman lived full-time in San Juan. There was,\nhowever, a shaman who visited approximately once every two months and carried\nout healing sessions during his visits. Other shamans visited from time to time, and\nthey were sometimes called on to perform curing sessions. The Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc of San Juan\nmixed daily with criollos through their jobs as wage laborers, in school, in the shops,\nor in the health clinic. At least 50 percent of the residents spoke Spanish, and almost\nall the children attended school. Despite an informal and opportunistic involvement\nin the market economy, most Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc relied on their subsistence crops on a daily\nWo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc Medicine and Cultural Change 47\nbasis. Because of the relatively high population, there was some land pressure, with\nlittle mature forest within two hours\u2019 walk.\nQualitative Methods\nIn San Juan, I was recruited by community members to act as an interpreter and\ngo-between when dealing with the hospital or with doctors, so I was able to observe\nthe interactions between Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc and biomedical practitioners. I also interacted\nfrequently with hospital staff, including staying in the home of a senior nurse for a\nshort period of time. I collected and recorded details on illness episodes presented\nto the clinics, the response of health care professionals, and the reaction in the\ncommunity. I also noted deaths and their purported cause from both the Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc\ncommunity and the biomedical professionals. Whenever possible, I discussed the\nepisode with both the Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc and a member of the hospital staff.\nOver the entire 18-month period, I spent considerable time in participant-\nobservation, primarily with women and family groups. I accompanied them on their\ndaily activities, including agriculture, food preparation, gathering wild plants, and\nchild care. These activities usually occurred in the morning, leaving the afternoons\nfree for structured interviews and daily unstructured interviews, which I conducted\nwith nine of the households in San Juan, four of the nine households in Guara,\nand the single household in Can\u02dco Seje. These interviews focused primarily on daily\nactivities and also on household activities, particularly those in home gardens. I\nalso observed women preparing daily meals and medical treatments for household\nmembers.\nForest Plot Interviews\nThe data used to compare knowledge and use of wild medicinals are the result of\n121 forest plot interviews in San Juan (n = 60), Guara (n = 36), and Can\u02dco Seje\n(n = 25), representing 55 percent, 72 percent, and 83 percent of the communities,\nrespectively. The methodology used is a modified version of that described by Zent\n(2001). In each community, two forest plots were marked out: one in secondary\nforest immediately adjacent to each community (5 \u00d7 100 meters), one in San Juan\nin secondary forest ten minutes from the community (5 \u00d7 100 meters), and one in\nmature forest approximately 45 minutes\u2019 walk from Can\u02dco Seje and Guara (10 \u00d7\n100 meters). There was no mature forest near San Juan, so there was no similar plot\nthere.\nPlots were laid immediately adjacent to the communities rather than some dis-\ntance away to control for the possibility that people would be most familiar with\nvegetation closest to their homes. Vegetation type was also controlled for as much\nas possible, although this was difficult given the ecological diversity of the region.\nWithin each plot, each tree or liana over ten centimeters in diameter at breast height\nwas marked and measured, and a knowledgeable bilingual informant was inter-\nviewed about all before choosing representative individuals of each folk species.2 I\nthen carried out semistructured interviews with as many residents as would agree to\nbe interviewed (see Table 1), asking them the names and uses of each of the species.\nThe majority of the interviews were held in Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc, using Spanish when possible\n48 Medical Anthropology Quarterly\nTable 1 Age and Gender of Interviewees\nSan Juan Guara Can\u02dco Seje\nAge Group\n(years) Male Female Male Female Male Female Total\n8\u201317 5 6 4 3 3 4 25\n18\u201340 14 17 9 11 6 7 64\n40+ 8 10 3 6 3 2 32\nTotal 27 33 16 20 12 13 121\nNote. Because many W\u00f5th\u00efh\u00e3 do not keep track of their age, individuals\u2019 ages\nare often approximated based on their role in the community (married, with\nchildren, grandparent, etc.).\nto add detail. In this way, I developed a database of 129 folk species used by and\nknown to the Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc in these communities. Of these, 30 were consistently reported\nto have medicinal use. Wherever possible, I interviewed each person in both plots,\nbut in some cases this was impossible. The average number of responses by each\ninterviewee is 44, with a standard deviation of 17 (n = 121).\nTo determine the \u201ccorrect\u201d answers, I developed a key based on male and female\nexpert interviews, participant-observation of harvesting or plant-processing activ-\nities, and follow-up interviews with groups of people from different communities,\nparticularly in San Juan. In some cases, more than one answer was considered cor-\nrect. I noted variation between communities and between hunters and nonhunters.\nIn a very few cases, alternative answers were not easily categorized. These were dealt\nwith by a series of follow-up and group interviews with male and female experts and\nnonexperts. This was supported by a more general elicitation of Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc botanical\nnomenclature and taxonomy (Heckler 2001). In this way, the key was modified,\nexpanded, and adjusted as new interviews added to my understanding of Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc\ntaxonomy.\nBased on the key, I was able to give a \u201cplant knowledge score\u201d to members of each\ncommunity and each gender. I gave one point for each correct name and one point\nfor naming a medical use; I divided this by total points possible (twice the number\nof plants). Although this method omits much of the richness and complexity of a\nfolk taxonomy, it does offer a benchmark by which the three communities may be\ncompared.\nHome Gardens\nMy survey of home gardens was based on hand-drawn diagrams of house clear-\nings, including all structures, water sources, and plants of all 13 households in San\nJuan, nine households in Guara, and the single household in Can\u02dco Seje. During my\ndaily visits to people\u2019s homes (20\u2013100 informal interviews in each household), I\ninterviewed household adults and children for the name and use of each species. I\ninterviewed a minimum of three household members on each home garden species.\nThe numbers of plants and species in each garden were collated into a spreadsheet\nwhere I analyzed them by use and origin of the plant. The origins of the plants\nwere determined by interviews with cultivators and community members; compara-\ntive work in the Herbario Ovalles, Central University of Venezuela, Caracas; the\nWo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc Medicine and Cultural Change 49\nbotanical library at Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, London; and regional flora\nand studies (Bennet and Prance 2000; Chitty 1985; Hoyos 1985; Schnee 1973;\nSteyermark et al. 1995\u20132006).\nBecause of the difficulty of deciding exactly when a cultivar stops being \u201cintro-\nduced\u201d and becomes \u201ctraditional,\u201d I had to establish a benchmark. Because my\nconcern with the origins of species is whether they are indicators of contact with\nother ethnicities and medical traditions, I consider that \u201ctraditional plants\u201d are\nthose cultivated by the Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc before living memory (Heckler 2001; Overing and\nKaplan 1988; Zent 1992); \u201cintroduced\u201d are plants that have been introduced to the\nWo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc within living memory (Bennett and Prance 2000; Hoyos 1985; Steyermark\net al. 1995\u20132006; and see below); and wild plants are those obtained or obtain-\nable from natural occurring populations within the area utilized by the Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc\n(Steyermark et al. 1995\u20132006).\nAverages, standard deviations, one-way analyses of variance, and t-tests were\ncalculated using SPSS 10.1.0. Figures were graphed using Microsoft Excel 2003.\nZent\u2019s Research\nA direct comparison of the species cataloged by Stanford R. Zent and those cataloged\nin this study is impossible because, to protect the intellectual property rights of the\nWo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc, and on the explicit request of indigenous organizations representing their\ninterests, neither Zent nor I have published the names and medicinal uses of which\nthey can be considered the originators. However, I have compared my data with\nZent\u2019s 1985\u201388 Upper Cuao study in three ways. First, I have used his published\nresults, including floral inventories of wild and cultivated plants from his dissertation\n(Zent 1992). Second, I have reviewed his voucher specimens, deposited at Herbario\nOvalles, Central University of Venezuela, Caracas, comparing them with the species\nthat I identified in the Manapiare Valley. Third, I consulted with him repeatedly,\nincluding during joint trips to the Manapiare study communities, about observed\nsimilarities and differences.\nResults\nIn total, I cataloged 84 folk species that were reported to have medicinal use among\nthe Manapiare Valley Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc, 30 fewer than Zent\u2019s 114 species. Given that I never\nintended to catalog the entire Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc flora, but only to compare the different com-\nmunities, conclusions cannot be drawn from such a discrepancy. However, some\nimportant conclusions can be derived from closer analysis of the data sets, includ-\ning how the plants are managed, the origins of the species, and the explanatory\nframework in which they are embedded.\nWild Plants\nThe vast majority of Zent\u2019s 114 medicinal species grew wild in the forest and were\nnever cultivated (Zent, personal communication, May 2001), whereas only 63 of the\n84 medicinal species I cataloged grow wild, and only 49 have never been cultivated.\nThirty of the wild species were identified only during the forest plot interviews,\n50 Medical Anthropology Quarterly\nTable 2 Results of Wild Medicinal Plant Interviews Analyzed by Gender\nAverage Standard\nTest Sample (%) Deviation (%) Significance\nBy community San Juan (n = 60) 42.1 22.4 < .001\u2020\nGuara (n = 36) 52.3 17.7\nCan\u02dco Seje (n = 25) 63.7 12.0\nAll communities by gender Male (n = 55) 53.2 20.4 .085\u2217\nFemale (n = 66) 46.6 21\nEach community by gender San Juan male (n = 27) 50.2 22.5 .011\u2217\nSan Juan female (n = 33) 35.5 20.3\nGuara male (n = 16) 49.3 20.2 .373\u2217\nGuara female (n = 20) 54.8 15.5\nCan\u02dco Seje male (n = 12) 50.3 22.5 .580\u2217\nCan\u02dco Seje female (n = 13) 62.4 13.6\nNote.

Despite Zent\u2019s assertion that Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc medicinal plant knowl-\nedge is \u201cwidespread, diffuse and generalized\u201d (1997:340), only nine of those 30\nspecies were identified as having a medicinal use by more than 50 percent of the\ninterviewees. Thirteen of the 30 species were identified as having a medicinal use by\nfewer than 20 percent of the interviewees.\nThe average score for medicinal plant names and use was 50 percent, with a\nstandard deviation of 21 percent. The difference between female and male scores is\ninsignificant at a confidence interval of 0.95 (see Table 2). The three communities\nscored significantly differently, with Can\u02dco Seje highest, Guara middle, and San Juan\nlowest (see Tables 2\u20133), supporting the hypothesis that wild plant knowledge de-\nclines with socioeconomic transition, especially because San Juan scores reflect only\nsecondary forest, which is the highest-scoring ecotype in the other two communities.\nWhen the scores are analyzed by gender, San Juan women scored significantly lower\nthan San Juan men, whereas Guara and Can\u02dco Seje women did not score significantly\ndifferently than Guara and Can\u02dco Seje men (see Table 2). Guara women do have an\nobserved mean higher than that of Guara men (55 percent versus 49 percent), which\nbrings them close enough to the mean for Can\u02dco Seje women (62 percent) to not be\nsignificantly lower (see Table 3).\nFigure 1 compares medicinal plant knowledge to knowledge of all plants. Can\u02dco\nSeje, as our proxy for a traditional community, presents a model with which the\nother communities may be compared. In Can\u02dco Seje, averages for knowledge of wild\nplants are very high (over 60 percent in all categories), but men scored slightly higher\nthan women, and medicinal scores are slightly lower than scores for all plants for\nboth genders. In Guara, however, women scored higher than men for all plants\nand medicinal plants, whereas in San Juan, women\u2019s knowledge of wild medicinal\nplants was markedly lower than in any of the other categories. In both San Juan\nand Guara, the nucleation of family units and the absence of a full-time shaman\nplace more responsibility for health care on women. In Guara, women can respond\nWo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc Medicine and Cultural Change 51\nTable 3 Independent-Samples t-Tests of Wild Medic-\ninal Plants by Community at a Confidence Interval of\n95 Percent\nt-Test Significance\nSan Juan versus Guara .016\nSan Juan versus Can\u02dco Seje .000\nGuara versus Can\u02dco Seje .004\nGuara female versus San Juan female < .001\nGuara female versus Can\u02dco Seje female .150\nNote.

Note the difference between the women\u2019s medicinal plant scores in San\nJuan and Guara.\nto this responsibility by utilizing wild medicinal plants; in San Juan, the lack of\naccess to forest resources precludes this option, so they turn to other sources to find\ntreatment options. The lower scores for Guara men probably reflect the practice of\nsending young men away to study. The three shamans interviewed scored highly but\nnot more so than other people of their age. Indeed, the highest scorers were (male)\nhunters.\nThe low averages of San Juan men and women and Guara men suggest that\nknowledge of wild medicinal plants is declining (see Tables 2\u20133, Figure 1). How\ncan I argue, then, that medicinal plant use is on the increase? A key factor in my\nargument is the marked increase of cultivated medicinal plants.\nCultivated Plants\nAs stated above, the vast majority of the medicinal plants identified by Zent were\nnever cultivated by the Upper Cuao Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc. In a scan of Zent\u2019s inventory of 51 gar-\nden plots, only two of the 71 cataloged cultivated species are identified as medicinal;\n52 Medical Anthropology Quarterly\nTable 4 Number of Home Garden Medicinal Species Grown in the Communities\nWild Introduced Traditional Medicinal Species Total All Home\nMedicinal Medicinal Medicinal of Unidentified Medicinal Garden\nCommunity Species Species Species Origin Species Species\nCa\u00f1o Seje 7 1 1 1 10 54\nGuara 2 5 2 1 10 44\nSan Juan 8 8 4 2 22 77\nTotal 16 10 5 2 33 106\nNote.

In comparison, 36 (43 percent) of the 84\nmedicinal species identified during my study were under cultivation. Thirty-three of\nthese were cultivated in Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc home gardens.\nAll three communities cultivated medicinal plants in their home gardens (see\nTable 4). Only five of these medicinal species are traditionally cultivated in Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc\ngardens and are listed\u2014having a food, textile, or other use\u2014in other Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc\nplant inventories (esp. Overing and Kaplan 1988:330; Zent 1992:194\u2013198). Six-\nteen species grow wild in forest known to the Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc and have been transplanted\nor grown from wild seed in their gardens. Ten species have been introduced to Ama-\nzonas and to the Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc within living memory (see Tables 4\u20135). The origin of the\nother two species is not known (see Table 4). In Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc home gardens, then, at\nleast 26 medicinal species have been brought into cultivation within living memory\n(79 percent of the medicinal species recorded during my home garden inventory and\n30 percent of all medicinal species inventoried).\nMedicinal Plant Use\nThe forest plot interviews and the home garden maps measured knowledge and\nmanagement of medicinal plant species, not medicinal plant use. In Can\u02dco Seje, the\nmost \u201ctraditional\u201d of the three Manapiare communities and the only one with a\nfull-time shaman, I saw very little use of medicinal plants. I was told that medicinal\nplants were used primarily for minor ailments, including colds, cuts, insect bites,\nsnakebites, or skin rashes, or as stopgaps or supplements for shamanic treatment.\nStopgap remedies are applied during hunting and gathering trips to the forest that\nmay last for several weeks or months and are generally undertaken by small family\ngroups. Shamans may not be present on these excursions, and minor injuries are\ncommon, especially the bites and stings that the medicinal plants in Zent\u2019s inventory\nwere most commonly used for. Nevertheless, these remedies are not the first choice\nwhen at home, where, in Can\u02dco Seje, people depended on shamanism for their primary\ntreatment, with a supplement of medicinal herbs, some of which were growing in\nthe home gardens. During my time in Can\u02dco Seje, I saw only one medicinal species\napplied, Bryophyllum pinnatum (see Table 5), the only introduced medicinal species\nin that community (see Table 4).\nIn Guara, the success of the community business created relative affluence, so that\nobtaining necessary resources from the state capital or from San Juan, which some\nvisited several times a week, was a viable option preferred by some residents, whereas\nWo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc Medicine and Cultural Change 53\nTable 5 Home Garden Medicinal Species That Have Been Introduced within Living Memory\nFamily Scientific Name Common Name Comments\nAcanthaceae Justicia secunda raborat\u00f3n\nlengua de suegra,\nmapanare\nIn Mar\u0131\u00b4a\u2019s garden; from Lesser\nAntilles, distribution limited in\nAmazonas (Steyermark et al.\n1995\u20132006)\nAgavaceae Sansevieria sp.

This affluence, however,\nwas relatively recent and not particularly secure, so most people would have experi-\nenced periods during which they were required to obtain necessary resources from\nthe forest, regardless of their preferred source.\nDespite the high medicinal plant use scores for Guara women, I never saw a wild\nmedicinal plant species used. The species I did see used, including Bryophyllum pin-\nnatum, Citrus aurantifolia, and Pereskia sp., were introduced home garden species.\nAnother commonly used medicinal species was Oenocarpus bataua, the oil of which\nis sold throughout Amazonas State as a remedy for chest colds.\nThe use of medicinal plants in San Juan was much more prominent and complex.\nI saw store-bought remedies and cultivated medicinal plants used in a variety of\ncircumstances, but only a few of the medicinal species known were used, including\nintroduced species such as Cymbopogon citratus, Justicia secunda, and Bryophyllum\npinnatum (see Table 5) and those in widespread use throughout Amazonas State,\n54 Medical Anthropology Quarterly\nsuch as Citrus aurantifolia and Oenocarpus bataua. Thus, San Juan was marked by\nregular use of a few introduced and cultivated medicinal plant species and infrequent\nuse of a wide variety of wild species.\nAn analysis of this data has highlighted some significant shifts in the knowledge\nand use of medicinal plants in the last few decades. Although many wild medicinal\nspecies are known, they do not seem to have been regularly used for at least two\ndecades, as indicated by Zent\u2019s study and suggested by earlier ethnographies. A\ncomparison of the different communities in the Manapiare region indicates a decline\nof general wild plant knowledge as communities become more involved in the market\neconomy and national society. Wild medicinal plant knowledge, however, shows\ndistinct trends, depending on the community and the availability of other medicines,\nsuch as biomedicine, purchased folk remedies, or cultivated medicinal plants. A close\nanalysis of cultivated medicinal plant species shows two major trends: (1) a tendency\nto use only a few of the medicinal plant species available and (2) a tendency to bring\nmedicinal species into cultivation that have never been cultivated before, the most\nregularly used of which are introduced from other parts of the world.\nBiomedicine in San Juan\nThe scaled-down and underfunded version of biomedicine in Manapiare during my\nmain study was perceived with fear and distrust.3 Doctors were stationed in San Juan\nfor a maximum of two years before being replaced by someone else and, as such,\nwere always strangers. Moreover, the clinic is located in the criollo neighborhood,\nwhich, until after my fieldwork, was under the control of an opposing political\nparty. Some doctors, including the one serving during the majority of my fieldwork,\nwere supporters of this opposing party, thereby becoming enemies of the Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc\ncommunity. Their motivations came to be distrusted to the extent that the Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc\nattributed the regular shortages of medicines to willful withholding of treatment.\nVisits to the clinic were seen as forays into enemy territory to seek assistance from\na dangerous stranger. The threat inherent in the contact was greatly enhanced by\nthe frequency with which the doctor, with limited equipment, was unable to treat\nvery serious illnesses and immediately sent patients away to hospitals in Puerto\nAyacucho or even Caracas, where they sometimes died alone. This was often done\nwith a demeanor of authority that effectively cut family members out of the decision-\nmaking process.4 The danger inherent in this activity has particular significance,\ngiven the Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc conceptual affiliation between power and danger. Biomedicine is\nconceived as a new and only slightly understood powerful force, which the doctor\ncontrols, just as shamans are able to control the productive power that is necessary\nfor life but can also cause illness. If the doctor behaves as an enemy, then Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc\nwill not risk further harm by visiting the clinic.\nNevertheless, the efficacy of pharmaceuticals, particularly for treating introduced\nepidemic diseases, has not gone unnoticed by the Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc. During my stay, I was\nbombarded with requests for aspirin, acetaminophen, and antibiotics, often as al-\nternatives to a visit to the hospital. These pharmaceuticals are seen as being cura-\ntive of symptoms but without the danger of the doctor\u2019s power. In other words,\npharmaceuticals are classified along with herbal remedies as being morally neutral,\nsymptom-specific treatment and yet, unlike wild medicinal plants, highly effective\nWo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc Medicine and Cultural Change 55\nat dealing with new and devastating illnesses. This reinforced a general confidence\nin the efficacy of symptom-specific treatments in general. To the Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc, the pre-\nscriptions of a doctor, the suggestions of a pharmacist, and the recommendations\nof a criollo, mestizo, or non-Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc indigenous herbalist belong to the same con-\nceptual category: reductive and symptom specific. In the days when shamanism was\npredominant, they were not seen to be particularly effective, but riverine perceptions\nof shamanism are shifting drastically.\nRiverine Shamanism\nSpace does not permit a full consideration of the dynamics of shamanism in the\nchanging Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc world. However, a few points are significant to the argument\nhere. Missionaries, both Evangelical and Catholic, strongly disapprove of shaman-\nism, and the Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc to whom I spoke unequivocally attributed the decline of\nshamanic activities to Christian prohibition. Rather than having a full-time shaman\nin each community, shamanic treatment only occurred in San Juan and Guara when a\nshaman visited from surrounding communities, usually no more than once a month.\nWhen a shaman was in town, he spent much more of his time treating the illnesses\nof specific patients than he did maintaining social harmony. Indeed, I never heard\nsinging, and other informants told me that it was something that did not happen\nanymore in San Juan but only far away in the forest (\u2018yo, de\u2019ana!). Shamans in\nSan Juan cured by \u201cblowing\u201d (Sp. soplando), without accompanying singing. Nev-\nertheless, the irregular curing sessions that I witnessed in San Juan were popular,\nand San Juan residents sometimes visited other communities to seek shamanic treat-\nment, perceiving it to be more reductive, incident specific, and separable from daily\nlife. Shamanism, as perceived and used by lay Piaroa, is changing dramatically from\nthe embedded, moral authority described above to a more pragmatic activity with\nbounded areas of expertise (Heckler 2006).\nNew Herbal Traditions\nThe absence of a full-time shaman and the nucleation of family units in San Juan\nand Guara have created a new conceptual and temporal space in treatment regimes.\nWhereas previously a health specialist was immediately and intimately involved with\nthe majority of illness episodes, now family members must make initial diagnoses\nand determine appropriate treatment. Thus, the role of the informal healer has\nbecome much more significant, and the person who fills that role is usually a female\nfamily member who must select from an increasing variety of treatment options.\nThese options include medicinal plants from the forest, home gardens, or neighbors;\nover-the-counter pharmaceuticals or criollo folk remedies; a visit to a shaman; or\na visit to the hospital in San Juan or to a medical clinic in another community.\nThe order in which these steps are taken depends on many variables, including the\ntype of illness; religious affiliation; social factors such as how close the family is\nto a shaman, doctor or nurse, or any other health specialist; or practical concerns\nsuch as whether a shaman is in town, whether the shops or hospital currently have\nmedicines available, or whether the family has the money or ability to travel.5\n56 Medical Anthropology Quarterly\nIn many cases, the most widely available, spiritually neutral, and inexpensive\noption is herbal treatment. However, herbalism is not an undifferentiated and \u201ctra-\nditional\u201d category. In fact, the diverse sources of the medicinal plants used and\ncultivated in San Juan and Guara suggest that various medical traditions are being\nadopted by the Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc. In San Juan, I identified two primary sources of medic-\ninal plant species, each of whom brought that knowledge from their own healing\ntraditions and each of whom represented a model of the herbalist as female using\nexclusively cultivated plants: the nuns from the Catholic mission and a Yabarana\nherbalist with ties to the Caribbean coastal region of Venezuela.\nCatholic Nuns\nOne day, while I was sitting outside a house where a woman was suffering from the\nflu, a nun with about five or six teenage students in tow, some of them Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc girls\nfrom the barrio, arrived bearing an armful of mint (Mentha sp.). She was greeted\nwith enthusiasm, and the mint was immediately boiled into a tea for the patient.\nLater, I saw a Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc gardener who worked in the mission garden bringing home\nsome basil (Ocimum micranthum L.) that the nuns had given him to treat his young\ndaughter\u2019s cold (see Table 5).\nThe Catholic nuns, many of whom are from peasant communities in other parts\nof Venezuela and Colombia, bring with them a belief in curanderos and herbalism\nthat is deeply infused with Catholic symbolism. Press (1971) and later Taussig (1987)\nhave described Colombian and Putumayan healers who invoke images of Catholic\nsaints, use prayer, and refer their patients to priests. As the San Juan nuns pray\nfor the recovery of a sick patient, they also prescribe and give medicinal plants to\ncommunity members. As they discourage shamanism, they encourage the use of\nherbs as charms, incense, and votive offerings. And as the main schoolteachers in\nSan Juan, they have taught these beliefs to a generation of Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc girls.\nYabarana Herbalist\nOne afternoon, I arrived at a Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc friend\u2019s house to find her bathing her feverish\nbaby in what looked like dark pink dye. I asked her what it was called, and she replied\nthat she did not know, that her neighbor, Mar\u0131\u00b4a, had given it to her.6 I had already\nheard about Mar\u0131\u00b4a\u2019s herbal expertise from other residents of San Juan, both mestizo\nand indigenous. Mar\u0131\u00b4a is one of the 15\u201320 Yabarana, a Carib-speaking group, who\nlive in the Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc barrio and often intermarry with them (OCEI 1995). She said\nthat she is often consulted by her Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc neighbors in times of illness; not only do\nthey ask for plants and information, but also her propagules and planting styles are\nmaking their way into Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc gardens (see Table 5).\nUnlike most other gardens in the neighborhood, Mar\u0131\u00b4a\u2019s was surrounded by a\none-meter-high fence. The febrifuge that my friend had been using (Justicia secunda)\nwas scrambling over the fence. The arrangement of the plants in beds with borders\nand paths running between was strikingly different from the asymmetrical, ecological\nplanting approach of the Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc. Rather than being largely dedicated to food\nplants, as were most of the Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc home gardens, Mar\u0131\u00b4a\u2019s garden was dominated\nWo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc Medicine and Cultural Change 57\nby medicinals, good luck charms, plants to ward away snakes and evil spirits, and\nplants to bring intelligence to children.\nThe list of species that I found in her garden reflects the ethnicities of Mar\u0131\u00b4a and\nan affine, who also took an active interest in medicinal plants. Mar\u0131\u00b4a\u2019s affine is from\nIsla Margarita, an island off the Caribbean coast of Venezuela. Several species in\ntheir gardens are listed, with the same common name, in Flora of Isla Margarita\n(Hoyos 1985). These species, including Bryophyllum pinnatum, Pereskia guama-\ncho, and Sansevieria spp., are not native to Amazonas (Dennis 1988; Schnee 1973;\nsee Table 5). The Caribbean region of Venezuela is strongly influenced by African\nculture and is the seat of at least two forms of African-based healing traditions\n(Voeks 1993:70). The possibility of African influence is indicated by several species\nof Bryophyllum (Crassulaceae) found in Mar\u0131\u00b4a\u2019s garden, the origins of which are\nMadagascar and East Africa (see Table 5).\nGiven the paucity of ethnographic information about the Yabarana, our best clues\nabout what aspects of Yabarana tradition Mar\u0131\u00b4a may have incorporated come from\nthe excellent studies of other, nearby Carib groups. One such study is Guss\u2019s (1989)\nethnography of the Ye\u2019kuana. In it, he refers to \u201cwomen\u2019s herbs,\u201d which \u201cinclude\nplants to heal children, ease menstruation, aid or prevent birth, cure or produce\nfever, frighten snakes, stop rains, secure lovers, induce sleep, dispel ill humor, deter\nevil spirits, protect travelers and cause death\u201d (1989:35). With the exception of the\nlast category, this list is remarkably similar to what was in Mar\u0131\u00b4a\u2019s garden, even\ndown to some of the species being cultivated (i.e., Caladium spp. [Guss 1989:57]).\nThere is no evidence of \u201cwomen\u2019s herbs\u201d being grown by Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc women. In\nfact, Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc home garden medicinals were mainly used to treat physically salient\nconditions such as skin diseases, diarrhea, and fever. The single exception to this rule\nis Sansevieria spp., which, as a charm against snakes, represented a concrete fear\nfor the Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc. There was some indication that the Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc were also adopting\nMar\u0131\u00b4a\u2019s planting practices. Three gardens of Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc who were closely connected to\nMar\u0131\u00b4a through kinship or exchange relationships had small beds of medicinal plants,\nlargely introduced species, delimited by pebbles, planted in pots or containers, or\nfenced off in a way not seen in the other gardens.\nThe Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc, however, were not simply adopting practices from different tradi-\ntions but, rather, selectively adopting those that made sense to them and, sometimes,\nchanging the use and names of the plants to fit in with their own cosmology. For\ninstance, during my fieldwork Bryophyllum pinnatum was the most regularly used\nmedicinal plant and had disseminated as far as Can\u02dco Seje, where it was the only in-\ntroduced medicinal species. When a baby was born, sap from the plant was smeared\non the umbilical cord to prevent infection and to \u201chelp the cord dry up and fall off\ncleanly.\u201d The immediate source of this plant was Mar\u0131\u00b4a\u2019s garden, yet she reported\nthat it was used to treat bone and toothache. After some investigation, I found that\nthe Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc had applied the doctrine of signatures, a doctrine that they also often\napply to wild medicinal plants. The plant\u2019s most salient feature is that it bears small\nleaflike propagules on the margins of the leaves that fall off and take root, produc-\ning new plants. Although the Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc mostly reported that the plant did not have\na name (Mar\u0131\u00b4a called it \u201choja colombiana\u201d or Colombian leaf), they showed me\nthe \u201cbabies\u201d on the leaf margins when explaining its efficacy, symbolically associ-\nating it with birth and maternity. However, the fact that the propagules mature and\n58 Medical Anthropology Quarterly\nthen fall off also represented the drying out and falling off of the umbilical cord.\nThe Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc have applied a double symbolism that clearly points to the plant\u2019s\n\u201cnatural\u201d use. Interestingly, B. pinnatum and a few closely related species, having\noriginated in Madagascar, are listed as a treatment for rashes and other dermatolog-\nical problems in traditional pharmacopoeia around the world (Bodner and Gereau\n1988; Dennis 1988:18\u201322; Rao and Jamir 1982:179; Secoy and Smith 1983:49). In\napplying a unique symbolic logic to an introduced medicinal species, the Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc\nare choosing, adapting, and incorporating species and techniques into their own\nmedical system.\nConclusion\nThere are no reliable accounts of the situation before Milliken and Albert\u2019s purported\n\u201cknowledge bottleneck.\u201d It is highly probable that epidemic diseases have had a pro-\nfound effect on medical cosmologies in Amazonia, and it is widely acknowledged\nby Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc that biomedical treatments are often more effective than shamanism\nin treating these epidemics. Nevertheless, it does not automatically follow that the\nmarked decline in the pervasiveness and scope of shamanism is directly related to the\nsuccess of biomedicine, nor is the use of herbal remedies, although often considered\ntraditional medicine, in direct competition with biomedical treatment. The decline in\nshamanism is more attributable to Christianity (Heckler 2006), whereas the success\nof biomedical treatments, when they are available, has validated the use of herbal\nremedies in their absence. The evidence presented here points to a shift from a medi-\ncal cosmology privileging the shamanic epistemology, in which medicinal plants are\nconsidered to be supplemental or stopgap treatments, to one privileging a reductive,\nsymptom-specific approach to illness, in which medicinal plants are central. This,\ncombined with a higher proportion of the population living in nuclear family units\nin larger, sedentary communities, has led to significant changes in who deals with\nillness and how it is dealt with, including a gender shift.\nThere is nothing inherently female in the domain of Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc medicinal plants.\nIndeed, in Can\u02dco Seje, men scored slightly higher than women, and, as mentioned be-\nfore, hunters in all three communities scored highest. However, social and economic\nchange is widening what was a relatively minor gender division, with more men\nentering the workforce and focusing on market agriculture, while women are left\nlargely in charge of subsistence gardens, home gardens, and child care. With children\nin school and fewer extended relatives in the economic unit to help care for very\nsmall children, women are less able to travel (Heckler 2002) and must find solutions\nto illness episodes nearby. In San Juan, this often precludes the use of shamans or\nwild medicinal plants, and, because women are less likely to visit or to successfully\ncommunicate their needs to a doctor, it often precludes biomedicine. Instead, women\nmust find new means of treating the family members for whom they are responsi-\nble. They find support in this endeavor from other women in the communities in\nwhich they live\u2014in this case, Catholic nuns and Yabarana neighbors. As women\nusually are responsible for the informal healing in the traditions that Mar\u0131\u00b4a and the\nnuns have learned their herbalism from, they assume that it is a female role and\nfreely share their knowledge and interest with Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc women. And as women in\nmultiethnic communities adopt these new techniques, their kin who visit from other\nWo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc Medicine and Cultural Change 59\ncommunities learn and take propagules back to their own communities. Thus, the\ntravel of medicinal plants from one community to another represents an exchange\nnot only of biological material but also of diverse medical traditions.\nOutsiders, including some researchers, who come in search of traditional medic-\ninal knowledge often assume that women are the holders of this knowledge and\ndemonstrate their assumptions by asking Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc women about medicinal plants.\nFor the Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc of San Juan and Guara, who are astute observers of the society into\nwhich they are integrating, these external validations are highly significant. Much\nof the economic development with which they are involved, for example the sale\nof indigenous manufactured arts and crafts, traditional remedies, and wild honey,\nas well as ecotourism, demonstrates to them that an externally derived version of\ntraditional culture has value in this new world of market economies. The exogenous\nidentification of the Amerindian with plant medicines is pervasive (e.g., Schultes and\nRaffauf 1990), and the Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc are becoming increasingly aware of this fact. This\nexternal expectation and the economic benefit that it brings to local peoples will en-\ncourage herbalism to become a gendered and formalized practice. We may soon see\nthe emergence of a new class of female Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc herbalistas, who will be identified\nas traditional yet, in reality, represent a new hybridization of healing and religious\ntraditions. Not only is Wo\u02dcth\u0131\u00a8ha\u02dc medical practice changing to fit new constraints and\nopportunities, but, paradoxically, it is changing to become more like what outsiders\nalways thought it was.\nNotes\nAcknowledgments.
