INTRODUCTION\nIn a famous passage in his Ethics, Aristotle considers the nature of equity\nand its relation to justice.1 His conclusion seems to be that equity\u2019s role is\nto prevent the law from adhering too rigidly to its own rules and principles\nwhen those rules and principles produce injustice. Hence equity permits\njudges to depart from legal principle in order to promote justice. In this ar-\nticle, however, I argue that this conclusion is problematic as it is inconsistent\nwith other claims Aristotle makes, both in his short discussion of equity in\nthe Ethics and elsewhere. Accordingly, I suggest a reinterpretation of Aris-\ntotle\u2019s view that explains more satisfactorily the connection between law, in\nits various senses, and justice.\nII. FORMS AND KINDS OF JUSTICE\nFor Aristotle, \u201cjustice\u201d has both a particular and a general meaning. In its\ngeneral sense, it is a synonym for virtue; the just man being the virtuous\nor good man. Conversely, in its more particular sense, the only sense with\nwhich we are interested here, justice is concerned with only part of virtue:\ngiving persons their due. Aristotle maintains that particular justice has two\nforms: distributive and corrective.2 He also describes a kind of justice\u2014legal\njustice\u2014and identifies equity in relation to both legal justice and particular\njustice.\n* I would like to thank John Gardner and the anonymous reviewer for Legal Theory.\n1. ARISTOTLE, ETHICS, 198\u2013200 [1137a32\u20131138a3] (J.A.K. Thomson, trans., 1976). See also\nAristotle, Rhetoric, in ARISTOTLE: THE COMPLETE WORKS 2152, 2188 [1374a25\u2013b23] (Jonathan\nBarnes ed., 1984). I adopt Thompson\u2019s translation of the Ethics for the most part because it is\nmost friendly to the view I argue against.\n2. The translation is often \u201ccommutative justice\u201d or \u201crectificatory justice.\u201d I choose to adopt\n\u201ccorrective justice\u201d as that is the term most familiar to lawyers. In the following, I ignore the\nproblem that it is unclear whether criminal law belongs to distributive or corrective justice on\nthis schema.\n33\n34 ALLAN BEEVER\nIn order to understand the relationship of these concepts, it is necessary\nto comprehend the distinction between forms or species of justice3 and\nwhat I refer to as kinds or types of justice. There are many kinds of justice.\nAristotle focuses on legal justice and political justice, but there are many\nothers: justice within the family,4 between academic colleagues, and so on.\nJustice comes in kinds because the content of justice varies with respect to\ndifferent activities.5 Justice in the home is different from justice amongst\none\u2019s colleagues. Nevertheless, all kinds of justice are species of the overar-\nching particular justice\u2014I refer to this here as \u201cabsolute justice.\u201d Hence one\naction may be just from the perspective of one kind of justice, unjust from\nthe perspective of another, but absolutely just or unjust. Imagine that I have\na son and a daughter and that my daughter is one of my students. If I spend\nmuch time on all of my students then, as a matter of distributive academic\njustice (if we can speak of such), I may be obliged to spend time with my\ndaughter that means that I cannot spend an equal amount of time with my\nson. But this may be said to be inconsistent with distributive parental justice.\nNevertheless, it will be possible to say that some action\u2014likely to be some\nsort of compromise\u2014is absolutely distributively just.\nOn the other hand, the forms of justice correspond to general methods of\nevaluating justice: either in terms of the overall spread of \u201chonour or money\nor such other assets as are divisible among members of the community\u201d (dis-\ntributive justice) or in terms of rectifying \u201cthe conditions of a transaction\u201d\n(corrective justice).6 Hence there are only two forms of justice.\nAt least in theory, there are some actions to which neither form of justice\napplies: those that do not distribute honor, money, or other relevant assets\nand do not involve gains and losses in transactions. Other actions involve one\nform of justice, and some involve both. With respect to that last set of actions,\ndistributive and corrective justice may come into conflict. For instance, an\naction may be correctively unjust but distributively just (stealing from the\nrich to give to the poor?) or vice versa. In such circumstances, it is impossible\nto say that the action is just or unjust overall. There is no overall form of\njustice that captures both distributive and corrective justice. Hence, while\nsuch an action may be good or bad overall\u2014because, say, the distributive\njustice is more important than the corrective injustice\u2014we cannot say that it\nis absolutely just or unjust.\nAccordingly, there are two forms of absolute justice: absolute distributive\njustice and absolute corrective justice. In cases in which only one type of jus-\ntice is relevant, this presents no difficulty. However, in cases involving both\nforms of justice, the conflict between distributive and corrective justice is im-\nportant and, as discussed below, relates to Aristotle\u2019s doctrine of equity. For\nthe sake of simplicity and clarity, I postpone that discussion for the moment\n3. ARISTOTLE, NICOMACHEAN ETHICS, 70 [1130b30\u2013131a1] (Terence Irwin, trans., 1999).\n4. ARISTOTLE, ETHICS, supra note 1, at 189 [1134b10\u201313].\n5. Id.\n6. Id. at 176\u2013177 [1130b30\u20131131a1].\nAristotle on Equity, Law, and Justice 35\nand assume that the cases under investigation involve actions that are\nrelevant either to distributive justice or to corrective justice but not to both.\nIII. JUSTICE AND EQUITY\nOne consequence of the above is that legal justice is not absolute justice\n(distributive or corrective) but is the kind of justice appropriate to the activity\nof doing law, in a sense to be elucidated below. In consequence, Aristotle\nmaintains that legal justice exhibits certain deficiencies from the perspective\nof absolute justice. One reason for this is that \u201call law is universal, and there\nare some things about which it is not possible to pronounce rightly in general\nterms.\u201d7 The latter claim is a product of Aristotle\u2019s view that in ethics \u201cwe\nmust be satisfied with a broad outline of the truth; that is, in arguing about\nwhat is for the most part so from premises which are for the most part true\nwe must be content to draw conclusions that are similarly qualified.\u201d8 We\nmay summarize this by saying that for Aristotle, ethical truth is too complex\nto be captured by any finite consistent set of principles. Hence a system that\ninsisted on the observation of principles could not realize justice.\nHere, then, we can see why Aristotle would hold that legal justice cannot\nperfectly map onto absolute justice. As \u201call law is universal\u201d\u2014that is, as all law\nis expressed in terms of universal principles\u2014it is guaranteed to generate\nunjust results in some cases.\nEquity fills the gap between legal justice and absolute justice. The content\nof equity consists of those judgments required to reconcile the former with\nthe latter. Say that legal justice dictates that A is bound to do X but it is (all\nthings considered) unjust to require A to do X. Legal justice is that part\nof morality that dictates that A is to do X; absolute justice is the part that\npermits A not to do X; and equity is the part that acts on legal justice to\nrestrict its operation so that A does not in fact have to do X. Equity, then,\nis not justice itself but the part of morality that corrects the deficiencies of\nlegal justice.\n[W]hen the law states a general rule, and a case arises under this that is ex-\nceptional, then it is right, where the legislator owing to the generality of his\nlanguage has erred in not covering that case, to correct the omission by a ruling\nsuch as the legislator himself would have given if he had been present there,\nand as he would have enacted if he had been aware of the circumstances.9\nIn a recent exploration of this view, John Gardner maintains that this\nimplies an essential separation between law and justice. Because law must\nbe expressed too generally to map onto absolute justice, \u201cthe fact that they\nought to be just . . . tells against legal systems being too true to their ruly\n7.

According to Gardner, there-\nfore, Aristotle does not accept the view of legal formalists that \u201cgrotesquely\nself-congratulatory doctrine that law, so long as it remains true to its own\ndistinctive form, cannot but be just.\u201d12\nIV. PROBLEMS\nA. Legal Justice\nThe claim that equity permits judges to depart from legal justice in order to\nrealize absolute justice makes the interpretation of legal justice problematic.\nWhat is legal justice? The intuitive answer is that it is the justice enforced\nin courts of law. But, given the doctrine of equitable discretion, courts of\nlaw do not enforce legal justice. Rather, due to the operation of equity, the\ncourts implement absolute justice. What, then, is legal justice?\nOne answer is provided by translating these issues into the language of\nthe common law. According to this view, legal justice is the justice applicable\nto the common law, equity is the justice applicable to Equity,13 and absolute\njustice is the result of the combination of common law and Equity.\nBut this solution trades inappropriately on the peculiar meanings of the\nwords \u201claw\u201d and \u201cEquity\u201d in the common law. For common lawyers, \u201claw\u201d\nand \u201ccommon law\u201d have two relevant meanings. Speaking roughly, the terms\nrelate either to the decisions of courts minus the application of Equity or\nsimply to the decisions of courts. One might say that law equals law plus\nEquity. But these distinctions were of no significance in ancient Greece.\nFor Aristotle, \u201claw\u201d cannot refer to what we call law-as-in-law-minus-Equity;\nrather, it must refer to what we call law-as-in-law-plus-Equity. The conclusion\nmust be that legal justice is not the justice that the law enforces; but without\nexplanation, that is a curious position.\nA second answer to our question is that legal justice is synonymous with\nthe positive law or perhaps with a coherent account of the positive law. On\n10. John Gardner, The Virtue of Justice and the Character of Law, 53 CURRENT LEGAL PROBS. 1,\n18 (2000).\n11. Id. at 16. At least, this must be Gardner\u2019s argument if it is to connect with the views he\nintends to attack. For instance, though he rejects Weinrib\u2019s formalism, that theory does not\napply to issues such as law reform outside the courtroom. See, e.g., ERNEST J. WEINRIB, THE IDEA\nOF PRIVATE LAW 70, 210\u2013211 (1995). For similar interpretations of Aristotle to Gardner\u2019s, see,\ne.g., Larry A. DiMatteo, The History of Natural Law Theory: Transforming Embedded Influences into a\nFuller Understanding of Modern Contract Law, 60 U. PITT. L. REV. 839 (1999); Richard W. Wright,\nThe Principles of Justice, 75 NOTRE DAME L. REV. 1859 (2000); Emily Sherwin, Restitution and Equity:\nAn Analysis of The Principle of Unjust Enrichment, 79 TEXAS L. REV. 2083 (2001).\n12. Gardner, supra note 10, at 12. Gardner\u2019s chief target here is Ernest Weinrib.\n13. For clarity I capitalize \u201cEquity\u201d when referring to the area of Anglo-American law.\nAristotle on Equity, Law, and Justice 37\nthis view we might say, in the language of the modern common law, that legal\njustice equates with precedent or with extant legal principle, and the role\nof equity is to reform the law\u2014through judicial overruling, legislation, and\nso on\u2014so that legal justice (the positive law) better reflects absolute justice.\nOn this interpretation, it is easy to see why Gardner would regard legal\nformalism as \u201cgrotesquely self-congratulatory.\u201d14 If the form of the law cor-\nresponds to legal justice, and legal justice is identified with the positive law,\nthen the formalist claims that the positive law must be just whatever it is.\nClearly, Gardner is right that this is not Aristotle\u2019s view.\nHowever, the idea that legal justice equates with the positive law does\nnot sit well with Aristotle\u2019s discussion. For Aristotle, the various kinds of\njustice are not merely descriptions of beliefs about justice or conventional\naccounts of virtue. Rather, the kinds of justice are parts of virtue. Accordingly,\nunless we have good reason to do otherwise, \u201clegal justice\u201d should be read\nas referring to the way that the law should be, not necessarily to the way that\nit is. Legal justice is the justice that the law should instantiate.\nMoreover, it is impossible to understand Aristotle\u2019s claim that legal justice\ndictates that law be expressed in general terms15 on the reading that legal\njustice equates with the positive law. Aristotle maintains that, when the law\nis too general to capture absolute justice, \u201cthe law is none the less right;\nbecause the error lies not in the law nor in the legislator, but in the nature\nof the case.\u201d16 But if legal justice was synonymous with the positive law, then\nsurely it would follow that legal justice is at least occasionally inappropriately\ngeneral. Consequently, the exploration of legal justice must be read as an\nexamination of the natural law and not merely a reflection of the positive\nlaw of some society.17\nThis demonstrates that even were Gardner right to identify the form of\nthe law with legal justice, in an important sense \u201cso long as it remains true\nto its own distinctive form [the law] cannot but be just.\u201d18 On Gardner\u2019s\nreading, the law\u2019s form is legal justice, which is a kind of justice according\nto Aristotle, though it is to some extent deficient.19\nMore important, if the doctrine of equitable discretion were correct, then\nit would be unintuitive to regard the form of the law as corresponding to\nlegal justice. For a legal formalist, the law\u2019s form dictates how judges should\ndecide cases.20 Hence, accepting the doctrine of equitable discretion, the\n14. Gardner, supra note 10, at 12.\n15. Supra note 1, at 199 [1137b20\u201324].\n16. Id. at 199 [1137b15\u201320].\n17. Cf. Tony Burns, Aristotle and Natural Law, 19 HIST. POL. THOUGHT 142, 162\u2013166 (1998)\n(exploring Aristotle\u2019s natural law theory).\n18. Gardner, supra note 10, at 12.\n19. It may appear incoherent to argue that a kind of justice can be deficient: If it is deficient,\nthen it is not justice. However, it must be recalled that legal justice, like political justice, is the\njustice relevant to some kind of activity. In Aristotle\u2019s view, the justice relevant to some types of\nactivity may be appropriate to that activity but to some extent inconsistent with absolute justice.\nSee infra, text accompanying notes 43\u201359, 67.\n20. Weinrib, supra note 11, at ch. 2.\n38 ALLAN BEEVER\nform of the law could relate only to legal justice plus equity and not to\nlegal justice alone. On this approach, legal formalism does not appear at all\n\u201cgrotesquely self-congratulatory\u201d;21 ironically, it appears to match Gardner\u2019s\nown view.22\nThe above leads to a third answer to our question as to the nature of legal\njustice. Perhaps the idea is that legal rules should be generated according to\nlegal justice. However, as no rules of any kind can perfectly capture absolute\njustice, courts are permitted to depart from legal rules when they are incon-\nsistent with legal justice. This seems to be Gardner\u2019s view in arguing that\n\u201cthe fact that they ought to be just . . . tells against legal systems being too\ntrue to their ruly natures.\u201d23 On its face, this asserts that it is in the nature of\nthe law to depart from its own nature. However, Gardner should be taken\nto mean that courts should not be bound by legal rules, even if those rules\nequate to justice as closely as it is possible for rules to do.\nOn this view, legal rules are generalizations true for the most part24 and\nhence are not binding on judges. However, while these \u201crules\u201d may serve to\nremind judges of salient moral considerations and may give an appearance\nof predictability to the law, as they are in no way binding, it seems odd to\ndescribe them as legal rules. Moreover, on this view, legal justice is the kind\nof justice that underlies legal \u201crules.\u201d But legal rules do not oblige courts\nof law and hence do not capture the justice that the law actually enforces.\nThough this is not incoherent, one would have thought that legal justice was\nmore important and had more to do with the decisions of courts than that.\nI conclude that the interpretation under examination cannot readily ex-\nplain the nature of legal justice.\nB. Law and Arbitration\nThe second problem with the notion that Aristotle argues in favor of eq-\nuitable discretion is the following. Almost immediately after the quotation\nabove, thought to assert that judges may depart from law on the basis of\nequity,25 Aristotle goes on to say that \u201c[t]his in fact is also the reason why\neverything is not regulated by law: it is because there are some cases that\nno law can be framed to cover, so that they require special ordinance.\u201d26\nIf Aristotle argues for the doctrine of equitable discretion, then it is hard\nto know what to make of this. Aristotle appears to claim that some areas of\nhuman life are ill suited to regulation by law because they are so complex\nthat justice with respect to them cannot be captured by universal principles.\n21. Gardner, supra note 10, at 12.\n22. Id. at 18.\n23. Id.\n24. Cf. John McDowell, Virtue and Reason, 62 MONIST 331, 336 (1979) (exploring the nature\nof moral \u201crules\u201d in Aristotle\u2019s thought).\n25. See supra, text accompanying note 9.\n26. Supra note 1, at 200 [1137b28\u201329].\nAristotle on Equity, Law, and Justice 39\nBut this is meant to be true of all areas of human life. Moreover, if equity\nis capable of remedying the law\u2019s inflexibility, then what is the problem?\nIf equity permits judges to depart from legal justice when it is inconsistent\nwith absolute justice, then it should follow that no area of human life is too\ncomplex to be regulated by law with a larger or smaller dose of equity.27\nHowever, perhaps Aristotle meant to argue that some areas of human life\nare so complex that it is impossible to fashion laws with respect to them\nthat approximate justice even for the most part. For an unstated reason, this\nmay be said to lead to the conclusion that law should not regulate in these\nareas. Hence the suggestion is that Aristotle\u2019s considered position is that it\nmay be appropriate for law to regulate those areas of human life in which\njustice is capable of being closely approximated by general principle\u2014\nthough general principle will never completely capture justice in any area\nof life\u2014while law must refrain from regulating those areas of life in which\ngeneral principle cannot even approximate justice.\nHowever, it is worth remembering that this is not what Aristotle actually\nsays. Moreover, it is not clear that the reply succeeds. Rather, the correct\nconclusion seems to be that in complex areas of life it is equity rather than law\nthat should do most of the actual governing. Hence Aristotle\u2019s conclusion\nthat these areas require governance by \u201cspecial ordinance\u201d does not follow,\nas the judicial enforcement of equity is supposed to be de rigueur.\nFor this reason, this reading cannot make sense of Aristotle\u2019s distinction\nbetween legal decision-making and arbitration. An \u201carbitrator goes by the\nequity of a case, a judge by the law, and arbitration was invented with the\nexpress purpose of securing full power for equity.\u201d28 But according to\nthe doctrine of equitable discretion, this is no less true in law. On this view,\na judge too goes by the equity of the case: equity trumps. For Aristotle, the\ndistinction between judging and arbitrating involves a difference in kind,\nbut on the view expressed here it is at most a difference in degree.\nC. Law Is General Principle\nThe above discussion also begs the following question\u2014our third problem:\nIf courts are permitted to depart from legal rules when they conflict with\nabsolute justice, why does Aristotle insist that the law be expressed in terms of\ngeneral rules? Of course it is possible to invent reasons\u2014for example, to give\n27. Of course, there may be reasons other than complexity why the law should not regulate\nin certain areas: privacy, liberty, etc. This is of no relevance to this argument and is in any event\nnot mentioned by Aristotle.\n28. Aristotle,Rhetoric, supra note 1, at 2188 [1374a18\u20131374b23]. J.A.K. Thompson suggests\nthat when Aristotle refers to judges, he intends arbitrators. ARISTOTLE, ETHICS, supra note 1,\nat 180, note 2. However, this is mistaken. In contemporary Athens, judges were jurors repre-\nsentative of the citizenry as a whole, whose role was to enforce law. Arbitration was a separate\nmatter. For instance, in private cases, arbitration was an alternative dispute resolution mecha-\nnism available to parties who could agree on an arbitrator. RUSS VERSTEEG, LAW IN THE ANCIENT\nWORLD 203\u2013204, 214\u2013216 (2002).\n40 ALLAN BEEVER\nthe law a veneer of predictability\u2014but these arguments are not Aristotle\u2019s.\nMoreover, in the Politics Aristotle insists:\nit is impossible that all things should be precisely set down in writing; for\nenactments must be universal, but actions are concerned with particulars.\nHence we infer that sometimes and in certain cases laws should be changed;\nbut when we look at the matter from another point of view, great caution\nwould seem to be required. For the habit of lightly changing the laws is an\nevil, and, when the advantage is small, some errors both of lawgivers and rulers\nhad better be left . . . .29\nThis caution is in tension with the notion that judges are free to depart from\nlegal rules whenever they generate injustice. First, if the legislator must not\nalter legislation, even when there is a small advantage in doing so, why is it\nappropriate for judges routinely to depart from law on the basis of equity?\nSecond, it is not clear why small changes in the law are required at all. If\njudges may depart from law on the basis of equity, then small, perhaps even\nlarge, alterations to the law may effectively be made by judges.\nFurther:\nThe advocates of kingship maintain that the laws speak only in general terms,\nand cannot provide for circumstances; and that for any science to abide by\nwritten rules is absurd . . . . Hence it is clear that a government acting according\nto written laws is plainly not the best. Yet surely the ruler cannot dispense with\nthe general principle which exists in law . . . .30\nAlthough Aristotle is not expressing his own view as to the desirability of\nkingship in this passage\u2014Aristotle appears prepared to accept kingship if\nit is clear that the king is significantly superior in virtue and wisdom to the\ncitizens31\u2014it is clear that Aristotle is of the view that if a society opts for\nthe rule of law rather than the rule of man, then rulers must utilize general\nprinciple. But if that is true of the rulers, then surely it must also be true of\njudges.\nMoreover, given Aristotle\u2019s supposed attachment to equitable discretion,\nhis claim that the law must be expressed in terms of legal rules seems inco-\nherent. According to the doctrine of equitable discretion, the law in fact is\nnot capable of being expressed in terms of general rules.32 Certainly, legal\nrules are capable of being so expressed, but these are mere guidelines, rules\nof thumb, rather than rules proper. The conclusion seems therefore to be,\n29. ARISTOTLE, THE POLITICS AND THE CONSTITUTION OF ATHENS, 49 [1269a10\u201316] (B. Jowett,\ntrans., 1996) (hereinafter \u201cPOLITICS\u201d).\n30.

Remembering that we are not entitled to help ourselves to the jurisdictional distinction\nbetween law and Equity.\nAristotle on Equity, Law, and Justice 41\ndespite Aristotle\u2019s explicit claims to the contrary, that law is not capable of\nbeing expressed in general principles.\nD. The Equitable Man\nFinally, the doctrine of equitable discretion seems inconsistent with Aris-\ntotle\u2019s description of the equitable man. The equitable man \u201cis one who\nchooses and does equitable acts, and is not unduly insistent upon his rights,\nbut accepts less than his share, although he has the law on his side.\u201d33 The\nequitable man is one who does not always stand on his rights. But what\nare his rights? The answer seems to be his entitlements according to legal\njustice. But that answer is unsatisfactory. If courts enforce absolute justice\nrather than legal justice, then there is no right to legal justice. The answer\nimplausibly implies that one has a legal right to something that a court will\nnot and should not enforce. Moreover, Aristotle claims that the equitable\nman has law on his side, rather than on the side of justice. But again, this\nseems to make sense only if we anachronistically rely on a jurisdictional\ndistinction between law and Equity.\nWe have seen, then, that there are serious problems with the idea that Aris-\ntotle accepts the doctrine of equitable discretion. His view of the relation-\nship between equity, justice, and law must be more complex and nuanced\nthan suggested. In the following section, I propose an alternative reading\nof Aristotle\u2019s view designed to avoid the problems encountered above.\nV. SOLUTIONS\nA. Legal Justice\nIf legal justice is not the justice that should motivate judges, then what is\nit? Despite the tendency of common lawyers to read Aristotle otherwise,34 I\nsubmit that his answer is clear: legal justice is the kind of justice appropriate\nto legislation.35 For Aristotle, then, legal justice applies not to judges but to\nlegislators; it is not a judicial justice but a legislative justice.\nHence Aristotle says that equity is:\nthe sort of justice which goes beyond the written law. Its existence partly is and\npartly is not intended by legislators; not intended, where they have noticed\nno defect in the law; intended, where they find themselves unable to define\nthings exactly, and are obliged to legislate universally where matters hold only\nfor the most part; or where it is not easy to be complete owing to the endless\n33. ETHICS, supra note 1, at 200 [1137b35\u20131138a3].\n34. See supra note 11.\n35. See also John E. Pattantyus, Aristotle\u2019s Doctrine of Equity, 51 MODERN SCHOOLMAN 213, 217\n(1974).\n42 ALLAN BEEVER\npossible cases presented, such as the kinds and sizes of weapons that may be\nused to inflict wounds\u2014a lifetime would be too short to make out a complete\nlist of these. If, then, a precise statement is impossible and yet legislation is\nnecessary, the law must be expressed in wide terms; and so, if a man has no\nmore than a finger-ring on his hand when he lifts it to strike or actually strikes\nanother man, he is guilty of a criminal act according to the written words of\nthe law; but he is innocent really, and it is equity that declares him to be so.36\nAnd when he discusses the role of equity in remedying this error, he main-\ntains that:\nwhen the law states a general rule, and a case arises under this that is ex-\nceptional, then it is right, where the legislator owing to the generality of his\nlanguage has erred in not covering that case, to correct the omission by a ruling\nsuch as the legislator himself would have given if he had been present there,\nand as he would have enacted if he had been aware of the circumstances.37\nThe claim, then, is not that law in general\u2014including our common law\n(here meaning common law as opposed to statute law)\u2014corresponds to\nlegal justice from which judges may depart. Rather, the notion is that leg-\nislators should be motivated by legal justice, although it is understood that\nlegislation will be overly general:\nin cases where it is necessary to make a general pronouncement, but impossible\nto do so rightly, the law takes account of the majority of cases, though not\nunaware that in this way errors are made. And the law is none the less right;\nbecause the error lies not in the law nor in the legislator, but in the nature of\nthe case . . . .38\nBecause of this understanding, judges are permitted to depart from a lit-\neral interpretation of legislation when it is clear that such would produce a\nresult that the legislators would not have intended.39 There are two relevant\ncircumstances. First, the legislators may have passed legislation that would\nproduce a result that they would not have intended if interpreted literally in\ncircumstances that they did not consider. Here, Aristotle argues that judges\nmay interpret the legislation more flexibly to reflect the intentions the leg-\nislators would have had had they turned their minds to such circumstances.\nSecond, the legislators may have known that in a certain circumstances the\nlegislation interpreted literally would work injustice, but may have been\n36. Rhetoric, supra note 1, at 2188 [1374a18\u20131374b23].\n37. ETHICS, supra note 1, at 199 [1137b20\u201324].\n38. Id. at 199 [1137b15\u201318].\n39. Cf. ZIVILGESETZBUCH art. 1 (Switzerland). \u201cIn the absence of an applicable legal provision,\nthe judge pronounces in accordance with customary law and, in the absence of a custom,\naccording to the rules that he would establish if he had to act as legislator.\u201d The content of\nlegal justice is discussed infra notes 49, 55.\nAristotle on Equity, Law, and Justice 43\nunable to frame the legislation to avoid this. In such circumstances, Aristo-\ntle maintains that judges may realize the actual intentions of the legislators\nrather than their intentions as literally expressed in the legislation. The role\nof equity in law, then, is to realize the intentions of the legislator not cap-\ntured by the general principles expressed in the legislation. As we would say,\nequity directs attention to the spirit rather than to the letter of the law.\nNote that this does not mean that judges have the power to interpret\nstatutes in the light of absolute justice. Aristotle\u2019s claim is only that judges\nmay attempt to realize the intent of the legislator, given that that intent will\nnot and cannot be captured in the form that legislation must take. This,\nthen, is far from the view that equity is justice\u2019s rebellion against law.\nB. Law Is General Principle\nThat equity in law is a principle of statutory interpretation also explains Aris-\ntotle\u2019s endorsement for societies governed by the rule of law of the claim\nthat \u201csurely the ruler cannot dispense with the general principle which exists\nin law.\u201d40 This is not an assertion of a moral principle\u2014an assertion com-\npletely unsupported by argument\u2014but rather the following practical point.\nIf a society is governed by more than one person, then a decision-making\nprocedure must be found for determining the decisions that are to govern\nthe society. The content of these decisions cannot be discovered merely by\nasking any one individual. Hence the decisions must be expressed in some ob-\njective manner. In practice, this means that decisions must be expressed in\nlegislation, and legislation must be expressed in terms of general principles,\nthere being no other way of writing it.\nSeeing that Aristotle\u2019s discussion of equity in law is focused on legislation\nallows us to solve two of our problems: the meaning of legal justice and\nthe need for law, meaning legislation, to be expressed in terms of general\nprinciple. Two problems remain. These are understanding the equitable\nman and the claim that some areas of life must be governed by arbitration\nrather than by law. These are solved by shifting our attention away from law.\nC. The Equitable Man\nTo whom is Aristotle\u2019s discussion of equity directed? The usual answer is that\nit is directed at the judge: Aristotle is concerned to elucidate appropriate ju-\ndicial decision-making. No doubt this is one of Aristotle\u2019s aims, as discussed\nearlier in this section. However, it is not his sole objective. Recall that Aris-\ntotle\u2019s discussion of equity occurs in the context of a examination of virtue.\nThe goal of the Ethics is not to provide a theory of law or of politics (at least\nas we understand the latter term), but to present an account of how citizens\n40. POLITICS, supra note 29, at 86 [1286a15\u201316].\n44 ALLAN BEEVER\nshould live their lives. The focus, then, is not solely on the role of equity\nin law but also on its place in ordinary life. In particular, the discussion is\nconcerned with the role equity plays in making a person just. This becomes\nmore apparent if we turn from J.A.K. Thompson\u2019s translation of Aristotle\u2019s\npassage on the equitable man to Terence Irwin\u2019s. \u201cIt is also evident from this\nwho the decent person is; for he is the one who decides on and does such\nactions, not an exact stickler for justice in the bad way, but taking less than\nhe might even though he has the law on his side.\u201d41\nFirst, note that Irwin chooses the term \u201cdecency\u201d rather than \u201cequity,\u201d\nmaking clear that the focus is not on judges in courtrooms but on citizens\nin their daily lives. It is also clear that the equitable or decent man is one\nwho accepts less than the law will give him. This does not mean that he takes\nless than legislation would have given him were it not for the principles\nof statutory interpretation (i.e., equity in law). It means what it says: the\nequitable man is one who sometimes declines to enforce his legal rights. In\norder to see why this would be, it is necessary to examine further Aristotle\u2019s\nview of the connection between justice and law.\ni. Distributive Justice and the Law\nAs indicated above, Aristotle distinguishes between distributive justice and\ncorrective justice. Unsurprisingly, he argues that the content of the former is\nessentially political. This is because distributive justice relies on a conception\nof equality that is politically controversial.42 Thus:\nEveryone agrees that justice in distribution must be in accordance with merit\nin some sense, but they do not all mean the same kind of merit: the democratic\nview is that the criterion is free birth; the oligarchic that it is wealth or good\nfamily; the aristocratic that it is excellence.43\nAccordingly, Aristotle is unable to elucidate the content of distributive justice\nin the Ethics. That task must await a full exploration of political justice in the\nPolitics.\nIn Aristotle\u2019s view, the aim of politics is to produce virtue and thereby\nhappiness in citizens.44 However, Aristotle recognizes that people disagree\nas to the content of virtue and happiness; hence people disagree as to the ap-\npropriate content of politics. Aristotle describes this dispute as conflict over\nthe constitution45 and characterizes the dispute as related to distributive\n41. NICOMACHEAN ETHICS, supra note 3, at 84 [1137b35\u20131138a3]. The interpretation I offer\nin the following does not rely specifically on this translation, though this translation is more\nsuggestive than others.\n42. ETHICS, supra note 1, at 177\u2013178 [1131a20\u201325].\n43. Id. at 178 [1131a25\u201329].\n44. POLITICS, supra note 29, at 13 [1252b29\u201330]. Compare TERENCE IRWIN, ARISTOTLE\u2019S FIRST\nPRINCIPLES 425 (1988) (arguing that Aristotle\u2019s theory is ambiguous as to whether politics aims\nfor the good of society as a whole or for the good of each individual).\n45. The remainder of POLITICS deals with how the constitution is best implemented in\npractice.\nAristotle on Equity, Law, and Justice 45\njustice.46 In the Politics, Aristotle elucidates and defends his conception of\nthe best constitution. Nevertheless, Aristotle insists that \u201cthe best is often\nunattainable, and therefore the true legislator and statesman ought to be\nacquainted, not only with that which is best in the abstract, but also with\nthat which is best relatively to circumstances.\u201d47 Hence, although ideally all\nstates should adopt the best constitution, Aristotle recognizes that this is\nimpractical and that in practice states should adopt the best constitutions\nthey are able to adopt.48\nAristotle also insists that the laws of the state that relate to distributive\njustice should reflect the constitution as it is rather than an ideal constitution.\n\u201c[T]he laws are, and ought to be, framed with a view to the constitution.\u201d49\nThis means that a society\u2019s laws may not and in fact are unlikely to capture\nabsolute distributive justice. Accordingly, with respect to these laws, the eq-\nuitable man is the one who declines to enforce in his favor the laws that\ninstantiate the constitution\u2019s conception of distributive justice when such\nenforcement would conflict with distributive justice as it is in fact.\nFor instance, imagine that a state with an oligarchic constitution passes a\nlaw that generates an obligation in the poor to serve the wealthy. Assume also\nthat democracy, rather than oligarchy, is consistent with absolute distributive\njustice. Hence, while the law in question is compatible with the constitution,\nit is inconsistent with absolute distributive justice. In such circumstances, an\nequitable wealthy man would decline to enforce that law in his favor. He\nwould do so because, while he recognizes that the law is in accordance with\nthe conception of distributive justice captured in the constitution, he also\nrecognizes that the law is incompatible with absolute distributive justice.\nHence he takes \u201cless than he might even though he has law on his side.\u201d50\nIt is important to note that it does not follow that a judge is permitted to\nrefuse to enforce that law. To do so would be to undermine the notion that\na state is governed in accordance with its constitution. Were the equitable\nman to find himself a judge, he would be obliged to enforce the law.51\nii. Corrective Justice and the Law\nAs indicated above, Aristotle is unable to give an account of the content of\ndistributive justice in the Ethics as he recognizes that that form of justice is\ninescapably political. On the other hand, Aristotle does provide an account\n46. POLITICS supra note 29, at 73 [1280a7\u201322]; Francisco L. Lisi, The Concept of Law in Aristotle\u2019s\nPolitics, in 16 PROC.

Id. at 92\u201393 [1288b34\u20131289a25].\n49. Id. at 92 [1289a13\u201315]. The constitution, then, determines the content of distributive\nlegal justice.\n50. NICOMACHEAN ETHICS, supra note 3, at 84 [1138a2\u20133].\n51. Similar points have led some to conclude that Aristotle was a legal positivist; see, e.g.,\nHans Kelsen, Aristotle\u2019s Doctrine of Justice, in WHAT IS JUSTICE? JUSTICE, LAW, AND POLITICS IN THE\nMIRROR OF SCIENCE: COLLECTED ESSAYS 110, 125\u2013136 (2000). For discussion, see Burns, supra\nnote 17, at 162\u2013166.\n46 ALLAN BEEVER\nof the content of corrective justice in the Ethics. He is able to do so be-\ncause the concept of equality operative in corrective justice is not politically\ncontroversial.52 Hence, for example, \u201cit makes no difference whether a good\nman has defrauded a bad one or vice versa, nor whether a good man or a\nbad one has committed adultery; all that the law considers is the difference caused\nby the injury.\u201d53 Therefore the focus of corrective justice \u201cis restricted and\nretrospective; it does not consider either the common good, or even the\nprinciples of distributive justice, but considers only the harm that has been\ndone and the means of restoring the status quo ante.\u201d54 Accordingly, for Aris-\ntotle, the content of corrective justice is apolitical and does not depend on\nthe constitution.55\nNow, Aristotle clearly believes that some areas of law appropriately in-\nstantiate corrective justice.56 As the content of corrective justice does not\ndepend on politics or on the nature of the constitution, legal justice with\nrespect to those laws that instantiate corrective justice is coextensive with\nabsolute corrective justice. Hence in this area the equitable man cannot be\none who declines to enforce his legal rights because he recognizes that they\ndo not correspond to justice in fact. Here, then, an alternative explanation\nof the equitable man is required.\nOne must recall that corrective justice is only part of justice. Accordingly,\nthe areas of law governed by corrective justice may conflict with distributive\njustice. Moreover, modern experience has taught us that this conflict will\noccur frequently.\nA good example of this clash between the forms of justice can be observed\nin the decision of the House of Lords in Bolton v. Stone.57 Members of the\ndefendant cricket club were playing against a visiting team when one of the\nvisitors drove the ball out of the ground and onto an adjacent little-used\nroad. The ball struck and injured the plaintiff. The court estimated that a\nball was driven out of the ground on average once every five years. The House\nof Lords ruled that as the chance of injury was so low, the defendant was\nnot negligent. However, the cricket club had paid damages to the plaintiff\nafter it had been found liable in negligence by the Court of Appeal, and\nthe club made no effort to recover those damages after the decision of the\nHouse of Lords. This is sometimes taken as evidence that the common law\nis out of step with justice.58 For Aristotle, this conclusion is simplistic. The\ncommon law may be entirely consistent with absolute corrective justice and\n52. ETHICS, supra note 1, at 180 [1132a5\u20136].\n53. Id. at 180 [1132a1\u20136] (emphasis added).\n54. Irwin, supra note 44, at 429.\n55. Hence the content of corrective legal justice is absolute corrective justice itself. Note that\nthis does not imply that whether corrective justice or distributive justice should be implemented\nin any one case is an apolitical question. See Weinrib, supra note 11, at 70, 210\u2013211.\n56. ETHICS, supra note 1, at 179\u2013186 [1131b25\u20131134a15].\n57. 1951 App. Cas. 850 (H.L. 1951).\n58. See, e.g., HAROLD LUNTZ & DAVID HAMBLY, TORTS: CASES AND COMMENTARY 196\u2013197 (4th\ned., 1995).\nAristotle on Equity, Law, and Justice 47\nhence with the kind of justice appropriate in this area of the law. However,\ncorrective justice is not all there is to justice, and hence the cricket club may\nhave been acting equitably in not standing on its legal rights and allowing\nthe plaintiff to retain the damages originally paid. Here, then, we may say\nthat the defendant was right (as a matter of distributive justice) to allow\nthe plaintiff to retain the money and the House of Lords was right (as a\nmatter of corrective justice) to find for the defendant and hence allow the\ndefendant (also as a matter of corrective justice) to insist on the return of that\nmoney.\nWith respect to this area of law, then, the equitable man is the one guided\nby justice as a whole rather than by corrective justice alone. As there is no\nform of justice that stands above distributive justice and corrective justice,\nthe equitable man must judge as to which should rule when those forms of\njustice come into conflict. In some cases, the equitable man will be prepared\nto accept less than his share according to law because he recognizes that the\nlaw enforces only a part of justice.59\nD. Law and Arbitration\nThe above also enables us to resolve our final outstanding problem: the need\nfor arbitration. In Aristotle\u2019s view, law is unfit to govern some areas of human\nlife because justice with respect to those areas cannot be approximated\neither by general principle, and hence by legislation, or by corrective justice.\nThese are the areas in which distributive justice is most appropriate but\ncannot be approximated in legislation. In these areas, judges should be\nreplaced by arbitrators who are to rely on their sense of absolute justice.\nIn conclusion, then, equity plays two distinct roles. In law, it enables judges\nto implement the intent of legislation rather than its literal meaning. Out-\nside law, it requires citizens to question whether their legal rights are abso-\nlutely just. It bears little resemblance to Equity in the common law and has\nnothing to do with rebellion against law.\nVI. PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LAW\nThe above suggests, though it does not necessarily imply, a neat distinction\nbetween public and private law. On this view, private law is based on cor-\nrective justice, which is independent of distributive justice and politics, and\nhence could operate outside specific legislation.60 On the other hand, public\n59. See also Pattantyus, supra note 35, at 215\u2013216. This argument also applies to the law based\non distributive justice. That is, sometimes the equitable man would decline to enforce in his\nfavor a law that correctly instantiates distributive justice, because that law is inconsistent with\ncorrective justice. This follows because there is no relationship of priority between corrective\nand distributive justice. See infra, text accompanying note 67.\n60. ETHICS,supra note 17, at 179\u2013186 [1131b25\u20131134a15].\n48 ALLAN BEEVER\nlaw would be designed to reflect the nature of the constitution and would\ncorrespond to the conception of distributive justice captured in the constitu-\ntion. This would rely predominantly, or perhaps exclusively, on legislation.61\nAs I now show, an argument for this view is at least latent in Aristotle\u2019s theory.\nIn the Politics, though arguing that aristocracy\u2014the rule of the virtuous\u2014\nis the ideal form of government, Aristotle also insists that it is unlikely to\nbe realizable in practice.62 This is because aristocracy depends on the abil-\nity to determine and promote to power the truly virtuous and because it\nsupposes that there will be agreement on such. Because this is unrealistic,\nAristotle settles for polity, a combination of democracy and oligarchy in\nwhich decision-making is distributed (unequally) through the citizenry. But\nif that is so, then it cannot be appropriate for judges to decide matters of\ndistributive justice. Issues of distributive justice are political questions rightly\nto be decided by political bodies, not by aristocratic judges. In this sense,\nin court equity is \u201ca mute divinity who cannot be heard.\u201d63 On this view,\nthen, because of its inherently political nature, distributive justice is not an\nappropriate subject for the courtroom unless embedded in legislation.\nThat argument, however, would not apply to corrective justice, as that\nform of justice does not rest on political controversial views.64 Accordingly,\nthe judicial enforcement of corrective justice would not amount to judicial\naristocracy.\nVII. ARISTOTLE\u2019S FORMALISM\nWhether or not the model enunciated in the previous section of this article\nwould have been accepted by Aristotle, the distinction between the kind\nof law designed to reflect distributive justice and the kind of law based\non corrective justice is important in assessing whether Aristotle accepted\na version of legal formalism. Clearly Aristotle holds no formalist theory\nwith respect to the creation of law based on distributive justice. Distributive\njustice possesses a form, but that form generates specific content only in\nconjunction with a conception of virtue and happiness. But there are many\nsuch conceptions, and it is the task of politics to choose between them.\nHowever, this does not justify Gardner\u2019s claim that Aristotle rejects the\nnotion \u201cthat law, so long as it remains true to its own distinctive form, can-\nnot but be just.\u201d65 This is because, on Aristotle\u2019s view, the kind of law that\nrelates to distributive justice (public law?) should reflect the conception of\ndistributive justice captured in the constitution. Hence, though the form of\ndistributive justice itself cannot generate specific content, in conjunction\n61. Burns, supra note 51, at 163; Kelsen, supra note 51, at 133.\n62. POLITICS, supra note 29, at bk. IV.\n63. Immanuel Kant, The Metaphysics of Morals, in PRACTICAL PHILOSOPHY 353, 391 [6:234]\n(Mary Gregor, ed., 1996).\n64. See supra, text accompanying notes 53\u201354.\n65. Gardner, supra note 10, at 12.\nAristotle on Equity, Law, and Justice 49\nwith a constitution it does do so. In a democratic society, the form of this\narea of the law will be the form of democratic distributive justice. Hence,\nin such a society, if the law relevant to distributive justice remains true to its\nform\u2014namely, democratic distributive justice\u2014then it cannot but be just.\nCertainly this does not mean that the law is absolutely just, as the democratic\nconception of distributive justice may be false. Nevertheless, Aristotle insists\nthat this area of the law should reflect the constitution\u2014\u201cthe laws are, and\nought to be, framed with a view to the constitution\u201d66\u2014and hence even if\nthe constitution is itself unjust, the law is just in the appropriate sense if it re-\nflects the constitution. In other words, for Aristotle, the appropriate (ideal)\nperspective from which to evaluate the justice of those laws relevant to dis-\ntributive justice is not absolute distributive justice but the conception of\ndistributive justice as captured in the constitution. Accordingly, Aristotle\u2019s\nposition at this point is recognizably formalist. On the other hand, Aristotle\nholds that the appropriate perspective from which to evaluate the justice of\nthe constitution is absolute distributive justice. Unsurprisingly, Aristotle is\nnot a political formalist.\nI turn now to the area of law governed by corrective justice (private law?).\nThe form of this law is corrective justice, and that form of justice in itself\ngenerates specific content. Now, the form of this law is not justice in total\nbut it is a part of justice. Hence in this area too, if the law remains true to\nits form then it cannot but be just.\nBut is this not a merely Pyrrhic victory? If an area of law instantiates only\ncorrective justice or only distributive justice, then it is not coextensive with\njustice as a whole. It is, therefore, not really just. However, it is important to\nremember that distributive and corrective justice are both forms of justice.\nAristotle does not argue that there is any priority between the two forms.67\nIt is not that distributive justice is real justice while corrective justice is only\na pale approximation, or vice versa. Nor is the view that there is a higher\nform of justice of which corrective and distributive justice are elements.\nRather, corrective justice and distributive justice are the two forms of justice.\nCorrective justice, then, is a part of justice, but it is not a partial justice. Hence\nif the law instantiates corrective justice, then it really is just\u2014not just in all\nsenses of the term \u201cjustice,\u201d but nevertheless really just. Similarly, a law that\naccurately captures distributive justice is genuinely just, though it is unlikely\nto be consistent with corrective justice and hence is not just in all senses of\nthat term.\nNote that it is no part of Aristotle\u2019s view\u2014and no part of the view of any\nmodern legal formalist\u2014that the positive law that exists or has existed at any\npoint in time is necessarily just.68 Rather, the claim is that the positive law is\nto be judged from the perspective of a particular form of justice\u2014corrective\n66.

It is the view that\nit is the task of the law\u2014and hence the task of those whose responsibility\nit is to shape the positive law\u2014to actualize corrective justice or the concep-\ntion of distributive justice found in the constitution. This is, of course, quite\nconsistent with the view that the positive law in many places fails to instan-\ntiate these types of justice and is therefore objectionable. The position is\nself-congratulatory only if \u201claw\u201d and \u201cthe form of the law\u201d are anachronisti-\ncally equated with \u201cpositive law.\u201d The criticism, then, involves a positivistic\ncaricature of legal formalism and distorts our understanding of Aristotle\u2019s\nviews.\n"}
