INTRODUCTION \nSince 1960, the exploration of Mars has progressed through \nthree methodologies: Flyby, Orbiter and Lander\/Rover. For \nthe next stage of Mars exploration, a novel aerial system \n(aerobot) is required to guarantee regional coverage of the \nMartian surface with high resolution sensing for precise \ninvestigations of geology and life processes. The existing \naerobot proposals fall into four major categories: balloons, \nairships, fixed-wing airplanes and rotorcraft. It is hard to \nestablish which one is superior. The choice of vehicle type \nwill depend on the mission budget and flight profile. The \nFrench\/Russian Mars Aerostat [1] proposes a balloon that \n                                                 \n1 1-4244-0525-4\/07\/$20.00\u00a9 2007 IEEE \n2 IEEEAC paper #1138, Version 3, Updated Nov, 08 2006 \nwould float at 4km altitude with a 5500m3 cylindrical \noverpressure envelope. JPL has proposed MABVAP (Mars \nAerobot Validation Program), which would use a super-\npressure balloon [2]. Gundlach proposed a Solar-Powered \nHybrid Airship, which is a hybrid mix of aircraft and airship \n[3]. A lot of fixed-wing airplane missions and conceptual \ndesigns were also proposed by various institutes  \n[4][10][11][12][13]. The well-known ARES (Aerial \nRegional-scale Environmental Survey of Mars) proposed by \nNASA Langley is targeted to explore the Martian Southern \nHighlands [4][5]. The other airplane missions and \nspecifications are summarized in Table 1. Young proposed \ntwo rotorcraft concepts \u2013 the coaxial helicopter and the tilt \nrotor [6]. Fielding proposed MASSIVA with the \ncombination of rotor and flying wing [7].  \nThe biggest challenge in Mars airplane design is the nature \nof Martian atmosphere. The low atmospheric density, low \npressures, low temperatures, and lack of oxygen, place strict \nconstraints on the design of the aerobot. The atmospheric \ncharacteristics are summarized in Table 2. The surface \ngravity on Mars is 3.71 Nkg-1, about 1\/3rd of that of Earth. \nThe average atmospheric pressure on the Martian surface is \nonly 0.69% of that of the Earth\u2019s at sea level. The day-to-\nday pressure variation is low in spring and summer but \nhigher in autumn and winter. The pressure varies from 1kPa \nin the deepest basins to 0.1kPa at the top of the Olympus \nMons [8] \u2013 cf. Earth\u2019s average sea level pressure of 101 \nkPa. The atmospheric density distribution on Mars also \nchanges with altitude, ranging from 0.028 kgm-3 on the \nnorthern plain to 0.005 kgm-3 on the peak of Olympus Mons. \nThe average density is very low, roughly 1% of that at \nEarth\u2019s sea level. These low densities and pressures demand \nthat any Martian air vehicle be much larger than its \ncounterpart on Earth in order to generate the required lift. \nEven so, the lift forces are small, so Mars air vehicles must \nalso be extraordinarily lightweight. For a fixed wing \nairplane, a high cruise velocity can offset, to some extent, \nthe need for a large wing area. However, the penalty for \nhigh velocity is a relatively high power demand \u2013 which \nalso tends to couple to low flight endurance. The major \natmospheric constituent is CO2, which means all the air-\nbreathing propulsion systems relying on O2 from incoming \nair as an oxidizer are not viable on Mars. The average \nsurface temperature on Mars is -63 \u00b0C [9], and this varies on \na regular daily cycle. In order to maintain a particular \ntemperature essential for some of the critical scientific \npayloads and sensors, thermal control is necessary \u2013 \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

MISSION \nMission Profile \nIt is preferable for our Aerobot to fly over the Northern \nplain on Mars so that it can take advantage of the relatively \nhigher atmospheric density at low altitude. From the surface \ntopography and roughness of Mars [14], it can be expected \nthat the plains of the northern hemisphere will also provide \nmore suitable landing sites. However, taking insolation into \naccount, the flight path should not be too far away from the \nequator. Besides the engineering considerations, scientific \nsignificance should also be valued. Hence, Isidis Planitia, a \nnearly circular plain about 1500km across, centred at 13\u00b0N, \n87\u00b0E, is chosen for this mission, as it lies along the \nboundary between the ancient highlands in the Southern \nHemisphere and the younger plains in the Northern \nHemisphere and it is a good candidate to look for sign of \nlife. \nGiven the weather data acquired from the NASA JPL \nViking missions and others, the best season for the flight \nwould be within the period of northern early spring until \nsummer, when the day-to-day pressure variation and wind \nspeed are small. In this period, the prevailing wind direction \nwill be westwards in the low latitudes of the Northern \nHemisphere. Hence, the preferable flying direction should \nbe from the west to the east. The mission will involve 10 \nflights in order to complete a crossing flight over the Isidis \nPlanitia. \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

DESIGN \nVehicle Selection \nVarious vehicle types are compared in Table 3 from the \naspects of potential mission objectives. \nMars balloons promise long duration flights that would \nmove with the winds. In the thin atmosphere of Mars, a \nmuch larger balloon is required to lift a given payload than \non Earth. The aerial deployment and inflation of such a big \nenvelope in the thin Martian atmosphere is still the most \nchallenging problem for the balloon concepts as stated in \n[1]. In addition, it is relatively difficult for a balloon to \nsurvey selected areas of interest on the planet due to the lack \nof directional control.  \nA conventional fixed wing airplane has the advantage of \nbeing able to provide controlled flight, but it is not capable \nof VTOL; hence this type of airplane is only suitable for the \n\u201cone time only\u201d missions as proposed by many researchers. \nThe fixed wing Mars airplane missions typically begin by \ndeploying the airplane in a nose-down attitude, which \ninvolves a dive below the cruise altitude in order to establish \nflight speed, and ends with an uncontrolled crash into the \nplanet's surface. As a compromise, they have to give up the \nwider coverage and surface sampling. The data transmission \nis also a big challenge for one time only missions because \nthe huge volume of imagery data that would need to be \ntransmitted within a limited flying period.  \nThe advantage of rotorcraft is their VTOL capability, but \nsuch craft are inherently inefficient and slow in cruise. They \nare also very power-hungry because the rotor has to \ngenerate both the lift and the forward thrust in the cruise \nphase [15]. In addition, the rotary wing will potentially \nsuffer from the supersonic tip speed of the advancing blade \nand the stalling of the retreating blade at a high angle of \nattack in thin air. Furthermore, the rotorcraft is less capable \nof replenishing power from solar cells mounted on its body, \nbecause of the relatively small surface area of the vehicle \nbody, so it will be limited to a range of just a few kilometers \nradius. \nConclusion\u2014Whilst recognizing the ambitious nature of \nthe design, in the proposed aerobot, the combination of \nfixed wing and VTOL capability will be explored. The \nadvantage of a fixed wing is that it can help to generate lift \nin cruise, and can carry a solar array on the wing surface for \nenergy replenishment. In addition, with the VTOL \ncapability, the mission profile can be extended to land \nperiodically to take surface samples and carry out contact \nexperiments. The data can be transmitted completely when \nthe aircraft rests on the Martian surface. \n \nTable 3.

Air-breathing jet engines are \nnot feasible on Mars as the carbon dioxide jet engine is still \nin the early stage of development [16]. Rocket propulsion \nsystems can work without oxygen, but these have to carry \non-board sufficient propellant for the entire mission, which \nwould limit the total number of VTOL manoeuvres and \nhence the duration of this particular mission. In such \ncircumstances, an electrical propulsion system promises to \nbe an advantageous solution because the energy it uses can \nbe replenished by means of solar panels. Although the \noperation of rotor blades in the low Reynolds Number and \nhigh subsonic Mach number environment of Mars poses \nsome problems, the Earth-bound Pathfinder series of aircraft \nfor high altitude long endurance (HALE) has proved the \nfeasibility of such propulsion systems by flying successfully \nat a 30km altitude, which provides a similar aerodynamic \nregime to that of the surface atmosphere on the Mars [17]. \nFurthermore, the development of high-capacity and low-\nweight brushless DC motors for Terrestrial Unmanned \nAerial Vehicle (UAV) will also contribute to this aerobot \n[18]. \nThere are various ways to realize the VTOL maneuver \ncapability, basically from three categories: augmented \npower plant for hover (ejector, ducted propeller\/fan, rotor), \nsame propulsion system for both hover and cruise (tilt shaft, \ntilt prop, tilt duct, tilt wing, tilt rotor, tilt jet, deflected \nslipstream, vectored thrust, tail sitter), and separate \npropulsion system for hover and cruise. Further details \nregarding each type of VTOL concepts can be found in [19]. \nIt is desirable to use the same propulsion system for both \nhovering and cruise. But normally the power needed for \nhovering and cruise does not match well. For the proposed \nmission, the power needed for cruise is less than 20% of that \nrequired for hovering. In addition, the stowing and \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on February 5, 2010 at 05:17 from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \n 4\ndeployment of the tilt rotors\/jets could be quite complicated. \nHence, in the proposed aerobot, we adopt the idea of ducted \nrotors for VTOL maneuver and separate propellers for the \nforward flight. \nVTOL Propulsion\u2014The four, three, two, one rotor and \ncoaxial counter rotating rotor configurations, as shown in \nFigure 1, were analyzed for the given design requirements \nand constraints: \no To lift a 25kg aircraft  \no To be stowed into an aeroshell of diameter 2.6m \no Rotor blade tip speed Mach Number < 0.8 \no Rotor blade stall angle of attack \u03b1<20 deg  \nBy assuming that the propeller can provide the required lift, \nwe can calculate the induced velocity (\u03c5i) and the required \nthrust coefficient (CT). Based on steady linearized \naerodynamics, the pitch angle (\u03c6), relative inflow angle (\u03c7), \nand effective angle of attack (\u03b1) can be calculated [20]. The \nresults of the analysis are shown in Table 4. The effective \nangle of attack from the 4 rotor, 3 rotor and 2 rotor \nconfigurations are all over the given stall angle of 20o. They \nall require high thrust coefficients, which turn out to be \nunrealizable because the blade has already stalled before \ngenerating the required thrust. The single rotor \nconfiguration is the most efficient in terms of lift and power, \nwhereas, the inherent torque effect of single rotor leads to \nadditional rotor or thruster on the tail, which adds on the \nweight. In addition, a 2.6m-diameter rotor leaves no room \nfor the rest of the craft. However, the coaxial configuration \noffers both the anti-torque effect of contra-rotation and an \nappropriate diameter, benefiting from its compactness. \nHence, the coaxial configuration is chosen for the VTOL \npropulsion system. \n \nFigure 1 - Rotor Configurations \nTable 4.

This would give the \nassociated advantage of multiple uses, with renewable \nenergy via solar panels. Indeed, as the thrust level required \nfrom the forward propulsion engines is very much less than \nthe thrust required from the lift engines, it was calculated \nthat we could sustain these engines with power directly \ngenerated from solar cells, provided the entire upper lifting \nsurface is covered in solar cell [15].  \nDespite the promise of renewable energy, the propeller will \nwork in an extraordinarily challenging environment of high \nrotor tip speed, very low Reynolds number and high \nadvance ratio. For this particular aerobot, the Reynolds \nnumber for the propeller is expected to be about 50,000 and \nthe advance ratio (J) is expected to be about 0.8. As most of \nthe earth-bound propellers provide the peak thrust \ncoefficient and efficiency when the advance ratio is 0.3, a \nspecific propeller needs to be designed to provide the best \nperformance. \nThree low Reynolds number airfoil sections are chosen for \ndetailed investigation of this propeller, including SD8000, \nSD7032d and S1223. The airfoil section coordinates, lift \ncurves and drag polar curves at Re = 60,000 (the closest \nvalue to the Reynolds number expected for which measured \ndata are available) are shown in Figure 2 & 3. The data are \nobtained from the UIUC airfoil database [21]. The S1223 is \nwell known as a high lift low Reynolds number airfoil. The \nhighly cambered airfoil offers the highest lift coefficient \nwhen the angle of attack is less than 5 deg, but the penalty is \nthe higher drag coefficient. The SD7032d offers the highest \nlift coefficient among the Selig\/Donovan series of low \nReynolds number airfoils, but its drag coefficient varies and \nis higher than that of SD8000 before stalling. Hence, the \nSD8000 is chosen as the appropriate airfoil for the propeller.  \nThree propeller geometries have been investigated. Their \nchord and twist angle \u03b2 along the propeller radius are shown \nin Figure 4. With the information of the aerodynamic \ncharacteristics of SD8000 and the propeller geometry, the \nthrust coefficient (Ct) and power coefficient (Cp) vs. \nadvance ratio (J) can be calculated based on the blade \nelement method (BEM) [20], results shown in Figure 5. The \nthrust coefficient of prop3 is much smaller than those of the \nother two propellers due to the smaller chord\/solidity. The \nperformances of prop1 and prop2 are quite close. However, \nboth of them reach a peak thrust coefficient at J = 0.4, then \ndeteriorate quickly as J increases further, because the \neffective angle of attack decreases as J increases. An \nenhanced version of propeller is then obtained by increasing \nthe twist angle of the blade of prop2. The results show that \nthe propeller performance has been improved dramatically, \nthough slightly degraded when J is small.

By comparing \nthe specific energy of various battery technologies (NiCd, \nNiMH, Li-ion, LiPo), the lithium type batteries stand out as \nthe desirable options. Table 6 shows the typical properties \nof LiPo and Li-ion cells [22][23][24][25][26]. Although Li-\nion can provide the desired high capacity, it cannot \nguarantee the high current needed in the VTOL manoeuvre. \nOne big advantage of LiPo over Lithium Ion is the ability to \nproduce a high continuous current.  \nFor each lift rotor, the power required is 1864W. Assuming \nthat the battery efficiency is 70%, then the total power \nneeded from the battery would be 2700W. Taking \nKOK3200-2s as an example, this power could be delivered \nat 42V\u00d764A. For the given 7.4V per pack, six packs in series \nare required per lift engine (= 511 kJ capacity).   \n \nTable 6.

For these reasons, in our calculations we took \nthe peak noon-time equatorial insolation to be a \nconservative 400 W\u22c5m-2. The effective daytime for solar \npower is around 10 hours at the equator. The total energy \navailable per unit area per day at the equator is around 3 \nkW\u22c5hr\u22c5m-2 or 10.8 MJ\u22c5m-2, which is in agreement with the \nestimation in [27].  \nTable 7 shows the performance of two candidate solar cell \ntechnologies: high-efficiency triple junction cells [28], and \nlightweight thin-film cells [29], which have the additional \nadvantage of being flexible, and therefore can conform to \nthe surface of the aircraft. The triple-junction cells have the \nadvantage of high efficiency, but the specific power\/mass is \nonly 1\/6th that of the thin-film cells, hence thin-film solar \ncells are selected for this mission. \nTable 7.

A typical Martian day temperature is from \u201390 \nat night to \u201320 at daytime. This places a strict constraint on \nvarious components of the Aerobot. Table 9 summarizes the \noperating temperatures of various components. As with \nprevious Mars missions, a central warm core is required for \nthe battery and other central electronics. Beyond this \nessential temperature-controlled inner, the majority of the \nvehicle can sustain operation at these typical Mars \ntemperatures. \nAmple insulation can be adopted to maintain the \ntemperature of critical components, which then require only \na very small amount of heating power. The insulation \nchosen is the highly insulative aerogel initially developed by \nNASA [37].   \n \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Assuming that 20% of the \nenergy generated by battery is turned to heat; the battery \ntemperature will be raised by about 25\u00b0C in one minute. \nThis should not be a problem, as the battery should function \nadequately up to +50\u00b0C. The lift motor\/rotor combination \ninvolves a particularly challenging thermal system on its \nown. In the morning the rotor will be initially cold along \nwith the motor, but during take-off the motor will heat up \nrapidly, converting ~10% of the input energy into heat. This \nenergy will raise the motor temperature by over 60\u00b0C. \nHowever, the cold start, and the short duration of the lift \nmean that it is unlikely that we would exceed the maximum \nacceptable motor temperature of 160\u00b0C. The forward engine \nconsume 20% of the lift engine energy \nStructural Design \nThe preliminary design is that of a flying wing combined \nwith a ducted propeller. The flying wing is chosen to ease \nthe stowing in the aeroshell and gain higher lift\/drag ratio. \nThe wing is folded for storage in the aeroshell, shown in \nFigure 6. However, the structural layout of the Aerobot is \nstill subject to changes as the analysis of its aerodynamic \nperformance and stability progresses. \nThe airfoils used for conventional airplane usually have an \ninherent nose-down moment; hence a tail is necessary to \nbalance the airplane. With regard to a flying wing \nconfiguration, a specially designed reflexed airfoil is \nrequired for stability reasons. Because of its preferable \naerodynamic characteristics and its success in the model \nflying wing market, the Zagi 10 [38] is selected as the airfoil \nfor the wing section. The aerodynamic characteristics are \ncalculated using Javafoil code [39], results shown in Figure \n7. \n \n \nFigure 6 - Aerobot 3-D Layout  \n \n \nFigure 7 - Aerodynamic Characteristics of Zagi 10 \n \nMass Budget \nAs investigated in previous sections, significant progress \nhas been made recently in the critical fields for such a \nproject: high specific power\/mass thin-film solar cells [29]; \nhigh specific power\/mass batteries [22]; lightweight and \nstrong carbon fiber structural materials [40][41], Polystyrol, \nHostaphan, Styrofoam etc. and their application in aircraft \nindustrial [17][42][43][44]; lightweight thermal insulator \n[37] and the development of high-capacity and low-weight \nbrushless DC motors for Terrestrial Unmanned Aerial \nVehicles (UAVs) [18] etc. Furthermore, the development of \nminiaturized MEMS and CMOS sensors and the \nperformance of single board computers will contribute to \nthe miniaturized flight control system [35]. Hence, it is \nbelieved that the electrical aircraft proposed in this paper \ncan be realized and the 25kg mass budget can be achieved \nwith the current technologies.  \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

An important aspect of the design is \ntherefore the autonomous guidance, navigation and control \n(GNC) system.  \nThe proposed aerobot will behave like a flying-wing in \nforward flight. A single control surface \u2013 i.e. an elevon \u2013 \nlooks to be simple, but is in actuality highly coupled and \ninefficient. So in this aerobot design, separate ailerons and \nelevators have been used. \nThe control of the VTOL maneuver is quite a challenge for \nthis mission because of the unconventional configuration. \nBy analyzing various schemes [15], a helicopter-style \ncyclic\/collective control of the lift rotors is chosen for the \nVTOL maneuver due to its efficiency. \nAutonomous localization and navigation of this Aerobot is \nstill a big challenge due to the lack of GPS on Mars. A \npossible sensor suite might include:  Inertial Measurement \nUnit with 3-axis accelerometers and 3-axis gyroscopes; air \nspeed sensor and altimeter based on airdata; fisheye imagers \nfor calibrating the attitude angles; sun sensor for rough \ncorrection and additional landmark and vision-based system \nfor optical flow and collision avoidance. \nThe GNC system is still under investigation as a separate \nstudy. In the following sections, the dynamics and control of \nthe forward flight will be discussed.  \n4. DYNAMICS \nA six-degree-of-freedom flight simulator has been created \nin SIMULINK [52] to support the Aerobot design process \nby providing performance evaluations. The flowchart is \nshown in Figure 8.  \n1. The initial conditions and control inputs are first \nincorporated into the system; \n2. The Aerodynamics and Propulsion Models will \ncalculate the corresponding forces and moments; \n3. These forces and moments are then input into the \nEquations of Motion to solve for the corresponding \nbehaviour of the aerobot (i.e. the states of the aerobot); \n4. The state outputs are then fed back to the Martian \nAtmosphere Model to update the atmospheric \nparameters in current conditions, and to Aerodynamics \nand Propulsion Models for the next step calculation \nfrom step 2. \nThe simulation is an iterative process. \n \nFigure 8 - Simulation Flowchart \nModelling of Dynamics \nAerodynamic Model\u2014The aerodynamic model utilizes \nlinear aerodynamics in which the aerodynamic force and \nmoment coefficients are computed as linear combinations of \naerodynamic derivatives with various flight parameters [45]. \nThere are various methods to obtain the aerodynamic \nderivatives including: analytical method, semi-empirical \nequations, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method, \nand experimental methods. In this paper, the aerodynamic \ncoefficients are obtained by the Vortex Lattice method [46] \nand DATACOM [47].  \nPropulsion Model\u2014The thrust and moment coefficients of \npropeller are calculated as linear 1-D interpolations using \nthe look-up tables of Ct vs. J and Cp vs. J as shown in Figure \n5 for the fixed-pitch propeller.  \nEquation of Motion\u2014The Equations of Motion include the \nstandard 6-DOF equations used for conventional aircraft \ncontrol design and flight simulation, i.e. twelve differential \nequations including: force equations, kinematic equations, \nmoment equations and navigation equations [48].

A more sophisticated \nmodel of Martian atmosphere is also available from ESA \n[8]. But for this research, as the cruise altitude would be \naround 1000m, the NASA\u2019s equation is considered to be \nsufficiently accurate. \nResults and Discussions \nLongitudinal Behavior\u2014Given an arbitrary initial condition, \nthe simulation will converge to a steady state, i.e. the \nequilibrium point.  The deflection of the elevator will \ndisturb the aerobot from its equilibrium point, but it will \nsoon converge to another point. Figure 9 shows how the \naerobot behaves after the elevator is deflected upwards by 1 \ndegree, where the red dashed line represents the initial \nequilibrium point and the blue solid line represents the \naerobot\u2019s state over time. With 1-degree deflection upwards \nof elevator, the velocity converges to a value lower by \n0.5ms-1, and the angle of attack \u03b1 and pitch angle \u03b8 \nconverge to a higher value. As the converged value of \u03b8 is \nhigher than \u03b1, the aerobot started to climb as shown in the \nheight plot. \nLateral\/Directional Behavior\u2014As this aerobot is symmetric \nabout the X-Z plane, it appears to be dynamically neutral in \nthe lateral\/directional mode at first sight. However, once the \naerobot is disturbed by an aileron or rudder step input or an \ninitial bank angle, this balance will be broken immediately. \nWithout control input, it quickly goes into a spiral dive \nmode as shown in Figure 10 and Figure 11.  \n \nFigure 9 - Longitudinal Behavior with Elevator Deflection \n(Step Response) \n \nFigure 10 - Lateral\/Directional Behavior with Aileron \nDeflection \n \nFigure 11 - Lateral\/Directional Behavior with Rudder \nDeflection (Step Response) \n5.

The step responses of nonlinear and \nlinearized model are shown in Figure 12. This shows that \nthe linearized model is in agreement with the nonlinear \nmodel, which suggests that this linearized model is \nsufficiently accurate for the controller design. \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Restrictions apply. \n 11\nLongitudinal Controller Design \nBased on this state space model, two mode controllers are \ninvestigated: Pitch Attitude Hold (PAH) and Altitude Hold \n(ALH), as shown in Figure 13 and 14.  \nThe PAH is the basic longitudinal autopilot mode. It \ncontrols the pitch angle by applying appropriate deflection \nto the elevator if the actual pitch angle differs from the \ndesired reference values. The pitch rate q and pitch angle \u03b8 \nare chosen as feedback variables. A feedback-loop of q to \nthe elevator has been included to damp the short-period \nmode. The impulse response of q-loop is shown in Figure \n15. Obviously, the q-loop expedites the damping greatly. \nThe pitch angle \u03b8 is fed back to damp the phugoid mode of \nthe aerobot and to ensure that the desired pitch angle is \nmaintained. A proportional and integrator (PI) controller is \napplied in order to eliminate the steady-state errors in \u03b8.  \nThe ALH is used to maintain a reference\/desired altitude. It \nfulfills a basic guidance function of the aerobot. This mode \nuses the PAH with an additional washout filter in the \u03b8-loop \nas the inner loop. The difference between the reference \naltitude and the actual altitude, \u0394H=Href\u2212H, is fed back via \nan amplifier to the inner loop, hence, the outer loop \ngenerates a pitch command \u03b8ref for the inner loops. An \nadditional washout filter is added to prevent \u03b8 from sticking \nto the zero.  \nFigure 16 and 17 shows the step response of \u03b8-loop (PAH) \nand H-loop (ALH) respectively. In PAH mode, \u03b8 \nsuccessfully converges to the given reference step input \nafter 2 seconds, whereas the open-loop dynamics will \noscillate for a while and converge to a wrong state. In ALH, \nthe altitude converges to the reference step input after 50 \nseconds. The overshoot is within 25%. \nLateral\/Directional Controller Design \nTwo directional \/ lateral controllers are investigated, Yaw \nDamper (YD) and Bank Angle Hold (BAH) [48][51].  \nYaw Damper is the basic lateral\/directional stabilizer to \ndamp roll and yaw oscillations due to Dutch roll by \napplying appropriate deflection to the rudder. Besides a \nreasonable gain, it is also augmented with a washout filter. \nThe impulse response of the YD is shown in Figure 18. The \nYD expedites the damping greatly. \nBank Angle Hold is a basic lateral\/directional autopilot \nmode. It controls the bank angle by applying appropriate \ndeflection to the aileron if the actual bank angle (\u03c6) differs \nfrom the desired reference values. The Roll Damper is \nincluded as an inner-loop to damp the short-period mode, \nresults shown in Figure 19. A PI controller is applied in \norder to eliminate the steady-state errors in \u03c6. The impulse \nresponse of the BAH is shown in Figure 20. The step \nresponse of the BAH is shown in Figure 21. The open-loop \nwill converge to a wrong state, whereas the BAH helps the \naerobot to gain and maintain the given bank angle. \nFurther Discussions \nAs the directional and lateral dynamics are highly coupled, \nit is not adequate to just design and analyze them separately. \nThe truth is: when the two controllers are integrated into one \nsystem, it doesn\u2019t work as well as expected. This is because \nthe controllers are designed individually without \nconsidering the coupling effect. Further investigation of \nmodern design control methods is necessary in order to \ndesign the various controllers simultaneously. \n \nFigure 18 - Impulse Response (Open-loop vs. Yaw Damper) \n \nFigure 19 - Impulse Response (Open-loop vs. Roll Damper) \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

FUTURE WORK \nThe dynamics and controller of the VTOL maneuver needs \nto be developed. It may lead to a displacement of the centre \nof gravity. The other difficulty lies in the transition between \nthe VTOL and forward flight modes. One solution might be: \ngain some height first, then dive the aerobot to gain \nvelocity, at some point increase the angular velocity of the \nmotor to gain altitude. The ground effect should also be \ninvestigated for possible utilization. \nThe controller design in this paper used classical linear \ncontrol methods such as root locus analysis, pole placement, \nfrequency domain method, time domain method and trial-\nand-error. The essence is the successive loop closure, which \nwould require lots of intuition and experience in selecting \nthe control system structure and feed back signals. The \ncontrol gains are selected individually through one loop at a \ntime. As more loops were added, the design procedure \nbecome increasingly difficult and are very likely to fail \nwhen the dynamics are multivariable, which is obviously \nnoticeable in the Lateral\/Directional Controller. Modern \ncontrol design such as Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), \nLinear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG), Linear Matrix Inequality \n(LMI), Receding Horizon Control (RHC), Dynamic \nInversion (DI) etc need to be investigated. \nThe mode controllers presented in this paper is just the \nfundamental level of an autopilot. The navigation, and \nlocalization are under investigation by another PhD student \nin Surrey Space Centre [53]. The initial thought is to use \nmachine vision system for navigation and localization \npurposes.  \n7. CONCLUSION \nIn this paper, we propose the use of a novel fixed wing \nvertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aerobot. A mission \nprofile to investigate the Isidis Planitia region of Mars is \nproposed based on the knowledge of the planet\u2019s \ngeophysical characteristics, its atmosphere and terrain. The \nfixed wing VTOL capability is explored, showing that this \ncombination uniquely allows for multiple flights, long \nendurance, high-resolution imagery and multiple surface \nsampling. The Aerobot takes advantage of the electrical \nmotor\/propeller for both the VTOL and forward flight \npropulsion, using solar cells to provide the power for \nforward flight, and for recharging the flight batteries for the \nhigh-power-demand VTOL manoeuvres. The power system \nuses a combination of the state-of-the-art rechargeable \nbattery and thin film solar cell technology. The suggested \n3kg payload would accomplish a basic scientific \ninvestigation and provide valuable information in searching \nfor life. The preliminary structural layout is a flying wing \ncombined with a coaxial contra-rotating ducted propellers, \nbut this may be subject to minor changes as the analysis of \nits aerodynamic performance and stability progresses. A \nmass budget of 25kg is shown to be achievable with the \ncurrent technologies. The Aerobot design proposed in this \npaper is believed to be a practical and realistic solution to \nthe problem of investigating the Martian surface.  \nA six-degree-of-freedom flight simulator has been created \nto support the Aerobot design process by providing \nperformance evaluations. The Vortex Lattice method is used \nto obtain the stability derivatives. An important aspect of the \ndesign is the autonomous guidance and control system. Two \nlongitudinal control modes are investigated and the \ncontroller proves to be effective.
