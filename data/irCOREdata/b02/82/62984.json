The inlier spans the boundary between two important terranes of the CAOB.  The Gobi Altai \nback-arc basin terrane in the north formed between the continental core of Mongolia, and the arc \nterranes of the CAOB.  The Mandalovoo island arc terrane hosts many mineralised intrusions and was \nlaterally equivalent to the arc that hosts the Oyu Tolgoi gold-rich copper porphyry deposit to the south. \nFieldwork traverses across the structural grain of the Saykhandulaan inlier have established five \nparallel E-W-elongate litho-tectonic domains; the Northern Slate Belt, comprised of Devonian \ngreenshist grade pelites and psammites, with deep-marine to coastal silici-clastic protoliths; the \nSaykhandulaan Valley Lineament Zone, comprising a zone of faulting featuring slivers of altered \nvolcanic stratigraphy; the High Strain Belt, composed of tightly folded and flattened meta-clastic rocks; \nthe Molasse Sucession (MS), relatively undeformed coarse conglomerates and sandstones and the Oyut \nUlaan Volcanic Group, a folded volcanic-sucession, up to 5km thick.  The Oyut Ulaan Volcanic rocks \nhost a mid-Carboniferous mineralised granite; the Oyut Ulaan intrusion. \nThe Northern Slate Belt records a cratonic provenance, whereas all parts of the inlier to the \nsouth have arc affinities.  The Saykhandulaan Valley Lineament Zone divides the area into northern \nand southern provenance domains, and delineates the boundary between the Gobi Altai and \nMandalovoo terranes.  \nTwo major deformation events are identified following basin closure; related to basin inversion \n(D1) and accretion of the Mandalovoo arc-terrane (D2).  Basin inversion resulted in regional scale \nfolding and greenschist grade metamorphism in the Northern Slate and High Strain Belts.  During \nterrane accretion the Oyut Ulaan Volcanic Group was folded and thrusting took place along the \nSaykahndulaan Valley Zone, exhuming the highly deformed rocks of the High Strain Belt.  Subsequent \nto the cessation of subduction, crustal extension and strike-slip faulting have further modified the \ncrustal architecture of the inlier.  The results presented here provide a useful framework for \nunderstanding the crustal evolution of adjacent regions within the southeast Gobi mineral belt. \n21 Introduction \nThe Gobi region of southeastern Mongolia lies within the Central Asian \nOrogenic Belt (CAOB), Earth\u2019s largest area of Phanerozoic continental growth, and is \na natural laboratory for documenting processes of terrane accretion and \namalgamation.  Important mineral deposits have been discovered in the SE Gobi \nregion during the last decade and consequently the region is now a major mineral \nexploration province.  Nevertheless, few studies exist documenting the basement \nevolution and lithotectonic context of the SE Gobi mineral belt.  This is partly \nbecause the area is remote, has low relief, and in general, displays poor outcrop \nexposure.  However, the Saykhandulaan Inlier (Fig. 1), which crops-out 400km to the \nsouth of Ulaan Baatar is unusual because it contains a large area of basement \nexposure and provides a good opportunity for unravelling the major tectonic, \nmetamorphic and intrusive events that have affected the SE Gobi mineral belt.  In \naddition, it hosts the Oyut Ulaan Cu-Au porphyry prospect and is along strike of other \nmajor exploration targets in the region. Therefore, a detailed multidisciplinary study \nincorporating field investigations and structural and geochemical analysis was carried \nout during 2004-2006 to document the crustal evolution of the Saykhandulaan Inlier \nand the terrane context of SE Gobi mineralisation.  \n1.1 Regional geology\nThe CAOB records terrane accretion and crustal growth between the Angaran \ncraton (also known as the Siberian Craton) and the North China Craton from the Late \nPrecambrian to Permian (Fig. 1).  The CAOB reaches from Kazakhstan to Eastern \n3Siberia and averages around 300km wide (Xiao et al., 2003; 2004).  Terranes in \nSouthern Mongolia lie within the CAOB, to the north of the main Permian Solonker \nsuture, which marks the final closure of the Palaeo-Asian Ocean in the Permian (Xiao, \n2003).  The basement geology of South Mongolia consists of island-arc, \nbackarc\/forearc basin and accretionary prism terranes that accreted around a \nPrecambrian cratonic block that lies under the Hangay Dome in central Mongolia \n(Fig. 1; Sengor and Natal\u2019in, 1996; Badarch et al. 2002).  These terranes record the \ntectonic evolution of the northern margin of the Palaeo-Asian Ocean during the \nPalaeozoic, generally interpreted to have taken place above a northward dipping \nsubduction zone.\nTwo hypotheses exist for the formation of the Mongolian CAOB crust during \nthe Palaeozoic.  \u0002eng\u00f6r and Natal'in (1996), postulated one long-lived island-arc, with \na complex history of magmatic front migration, strike-slip motion and oroclinal \nbending along its length prior to terminal accretion (Fig. 2a).  An alternative model by \nBadarch et al (2002), proposed the existence of multiple island arcs drifting across the \nPalaeo-Asian Ocean and accreting various arc-marginal basin terranes and ophiolite \nslivers before terminal collision against the southern margin of Siberia\/Hangay (Fig. \n2b).\nBadarch et al. (2002) suggest that southeastern Mongolia is dominated by two \nOrdovician-Carboniferous island-arc terranes (Fig. 1), the Gurvansaykhan and \nMandalovoo terranes, which are surrounded by back-arc\/fore-arc basins; the \nOrdovician-Carboniferous Gobi Altai terrane to the north and the Nuhetdavaa terrane \nto the south.  The Gurvansaykhan and Mandalovoo terranes are interpreted to have \noriginally been along-strike equivalents of the same island arc, but dextral strike-slip \nfaults shunted the Gurvansaykhan terrane southwest to its current location.  South of \n4these two terranes, near the Sino-Mongolian border, a series of parallel island-arc, \naccretionary wedge and cratonal terranes record a separate subduction-accretion \nhistory (Figs. 1, 2; Badarch et al 2002).\nSubsequent to Palaeo-Asian suturing at the end of the Permian, Mongolia \nunderwent several periods of intracontinental deformation.  Left-lateral strike-slip \nfaults were active in southeast Mongolia from the Triassic to late Cretaceous (Lamb et \nal., 1999) and between 185-235km of left-lateral offset occurred along the Zuunbayan \nFault, which forms the southeast margin of the Gurvansaykhan terrane (Fig. 1).  \nFurther west, a Jurassic contractional phase of deformation is expressed by E-W \ntrending thrust faults along the Mongolian-Chinese border (Zheng et al., 1996).  \nSoutheast Mongolia and adjacent regions of China experienced a major phase of NW-\nSE crustal extension during the Jurassic-Cretaceous (Meng et al., 2003).  Jurassic-\nCretaceous clastic and volcanic stratigraphy fill low-relief basins throughout the \nregion including areas adjacent to the Saykhandulaan Inlier.  The rifting is interpreted \nto be a distal effect of Pacific-rim back-arc extension (Graham et al., 2001).  \nCretaceous-Tertiary thermal uplift and volcanism are widely distributed in central, \nsouthern and southeastern Mongolia and are possibly related to a steady state thermal \nanomaly in the mantle beneath Mongolia and Eastern China (Barry and Kent, 1998).  \nSinistral transpressional deformation driven by the Indo-Eurasia collision, has \nreactivated the Gobi Altai region in south and west Mongolia during the late Cenozoic \n(Cunningham, 1998).  However, there is only limited evidence for renewed tectonism \nin southeast Mongolia (Webb and Johnson, 2006) \nMajor porphyry copper discoveries in the region include the Oyu Tolgoi gold-\nrich deposit, which occurs within the Gurvansaykhan arc terrane, 260km to the \nsouthwest of the Saykhandulaan Inlier (Fig. 1; Badarch et al., 2002).  Mineralisation \n5at Oyu Tolgoi is associated with arc related Siluro-Devonian porphyry magmatism \nintruded into lavas and clastic sedimentary rocks (Perello et al., 2001).  Another \nimportant deposit is Tsagaan Suvarga, a copper-molybdenum porphyry hosted in a \nDevonian calc-alkaline granite complex, 120km southwest of the Saykhandulaan \nInlier (Fig. 1; (Watanabe and Stein, 2000).  To the north, the Mandalovoo terrane also \ncontains several porphyry-style prospects in an east-west trending belt.  Part of the \nMandalovoo terrane lies within the Saykhandulaan Inlier and contains the Oyut Ulaan \ncopper-gold prospect (Fig. 1). \n2 Geology\nThe Saykhandulaan Inlier spans the boundary between the Gobi Altai terrane to \nthe north, and the Mandalovoo terrane to the south (Fig. 1).  The Saykhandulaan \nValley Lineament Zone (SVLZ) trends approximately east-west and marks the terrane \nboundary through the inlier (Fig. 3).  Five lithological and structural domains are \nidentified within the inlier (Fig. 3).  North of the SVLZ is the Northern Slate Belt \n(NSB) which contains folded siliciclastic meta-sediments.  The NSB is overlapped in \nthe east and north by several basalt fields (undated, but probably correlative with \nJurassic-Cretaceous lavas elsewhere in the region).  The SVLZ is 1 - 1.5 km wide and \ncontains a range of locally exposed lithologies, including volcanic lithologies of the \nSaykhandulaan Valley Formation (SVF) which mainly consist of altered intermediate \nand felsic lavas.  To the south of the SVLZ are several parallel litho-tectonic domains:  \nThe High Strain Belt (HSB) contains greenschist grade meta-sandstones and \nconglomerates deformed into tight-to-isoclinal folds.  It is exposed across the full \neast-west width of the inlier.  The Molasse Succession (MS) contains relatively \nundeformed conglomerates, sandstones and mudstones, and crops out to the south of \nthe HSB.  The Oyut Ulaan Volcanic Group (OUVG) contains a wide range of \n6volcanic and sedimentary lithologies and defines the southern margin of the inlier.  \nThe Oyut Ulaan Intrusion (OUI) cuts rocks of the OUVG in the south east (Fig. 3) \ncorner of the inlier.  The inlier is surrounded by basins containing Upper Jurassic to \nCretaceous and Quaternary sediments (Figs. 3, 4 and 5; Graham et al., 2001).  The \ninlier contains subdued topography with a maximum relief of 50m, outcrop quality is \nvariable and in many areas contacts and faults are not exposed.  \nIn this section, the lithologies of each of the domains defined above are \ndescribed in detail from north to south.    \n2.1 Slate belt \nThe Northern Slate Belt is a folded, greenschist grade, meta-sedimentary \nsequence (Figs. 3 and 4).  In the north, this sequence is dominated by pelites with \nwell-developed cleavage; the protolith coarsens to the south where fine- to medium-\ngrained psammites locally dominate.  An outstanding feature of this unit is the \npresence of abundant and volumetrically significant quartz veins.\nThe main rock type of the NSB is grey pelite, which crops-out in beds 0.5 to 2 \nmetres thick throughout the belt.  Graded bedding occurs and locally units exhibit clay \ndrapes and fine-sand lag-bases.  The sequence also features sparsely distributed 20 to \n50cm-thick beds of fine- to medium-grained meta-psammite which appear brown on \nweathered surfaces.   \nIn the west of the NSB where shallower stratigraphic levels are exposed, \npsammitic lithologies are dominant, featuring up to 1-metre-thick medium-grained \nunits interbedded with relatively thin 20-30 cm pelitic material.  In one section, flame \nand lobe structures, rip-up clasts and swaley cross stratification occur in the psammite \nbeds and provide younging criteria, however, original sedimentary features were \nrarely observed outside of psammite dominated areas. \n7Lithologies from the southwest corner of the NSB are generally less-deformed, \nare of a lower metamorphic grade than the rest of the belt, and are sandstone \ndominated.  Lithological logs from the south of the NSB show tabular sandstone \nbodies of between 10 and 50cm thickness, interbedded with mudstone sequences of \nup-to 1m thick.  Flame structures, lag bases, rip-up clasts and climbing ripples are \npresent  (Fig. 6).\nIn thin-section, the sand-grade units show different degrees of deformation and \nmetamorphism, from relatively un-cleaved greywacke, to greenshist-grade  \npsammites.  The metamorphic fabric consists of re-crystallised quartz grains and a \nmicaceous slatey cleavage.  Several samples display a penetrative crenulation \ncleavage and some have isolated kink bands.  Siderite forms a cement and secondary \nreplacement phase.  The rocks are generally more calcareous in the northern sector of \nthe NSB; sparse outcrops of a bio-micritic limestone occur near its northern boundary \nwith Cretaceous basin-sediments. \nThroughout the NSB, quartz veins cut the succession, the largest of which can \nbe seen from tens of kilometres away and form the highest topographic features in the \nbelt (Fig. 7).  The veins trend ENE deviating from the orientation of the regional \ncleavage by 10 - 20\u00b0.  Three generations of veins occur, the oldest are metre-wide \nveins (Fig. 7b) which are commonly cut by main mega-vein bodies (Fig. 7 a), which \nare, in turn, cut by later thin-quartz-stockworks.  Visible mineralisation is rare, \nalthough manganite (MnO\u00b7OH) was observed within zones densely penetrated by 30-\n70cm wide veins (Fig. 7c).  The giant veins and vein zones are found in discrete \ncorridors, with other areas exhibiting little to no veining.  Several of the larger tabular \nveins cut regional fold hinges and some smaller veins have saddle reef morphologies.  \nSets of veins have both right stepping and left stepping en-echelon morphology (Fig. \n87d).  The veins are largest in the southeast of the NSB, where the deepest stratigraphic \nlevels are exposed.  The veins are spatially related to coarser lithologies, and at \nseveral locations, psammitic beds feature stockworks of quartz veins.\n2.2 Saykhandulaan Valley Lineament Zone \nThe SVLZ runs approximately east-west (085N) across the inlier, forming a 1 - \n1.5 km-wide corridor of small isolated hills with little outcrop, between the NSB to \nthe north and HSB to the south (Figs. 3, 5).\nVolcanic strata of the Saykhandulaan Valley Formation are best exposed in a \nridge that trends 070, in its western reaches of the SVLZ (see box marking location of \noutcrop on Fig. 5).  An approximately 200m thick sequence of extrusive rocks (Fig. 8) \ncrops out in this ridge.  An amygdaloidal trachydacite (>20m) is at the base of the \nsucession.  This is overlain by a white rhyolite (~90m), which contains sub-planar \nflow-bands and local zones of intense flow-folding.  A variably-brecciated trachyte \n(70m) lies above this, and another trachyte (>25m), featuring dense euhedral feldspar \nphenocrysts, lies at the top of the sequence.  Rhyolites and trachytes crop out at \nnumerous other localities throughout the zone, commonly in prominent ridges with \nsimilar 070 trends. \nAlong the southern edge of the SVLZ, at the foot of some of the steepest and \nhighest topography in the inlier, basic dykes crop-out, both parallel and perpendicular \nto the lineament.  \nBrecciated and fractured lithologies are common near the ends of the prominent \nridges in the zone.  Cataclastic microtextures are seen in thin-section from several \nsamples in these areas.  Quartz in some of the felsic lithologies has been extensively \nrecrystallised.\n92.3 High-Strain Belt \nThe HSB is the zone of highest deformation in the inlier (Fig. 5).  Its northern \nmargin is the abrupt southern edge of the SVLZ.  Directly south of the SVLZ, altered, \ngreen, cobble- to boulder-conglomerates form 070 trending ridges comprising the \nhighest topography of the inlier.  The metamorphic grade appears locally elevated; \nsome metabasite clasts are entirely altered to amphibolite.  Two parallel bands of \nthese higher-grade rocks occur in the north of the HSB, with a narrow band of \ngreenschist-grade meta-clastic rocks between them.   \nSouth of the meta-conglomerates, the HSB is comprised of meta-clastic rocks \nfeaturing a range of protolith grain sizes from mud to gravel-conglomerate.  This part \nof the belt is similar to the NSB - cleavage is generally dominant, and the rocks are of \ncomparable metamorphic grade to the NSB meta-clastic rocks.  However, sandstones \nand conglomerates are the main protolith here, compared with mudstones in the NSB. \nCoarse sandstones are widespread, are generally 0.5 - 2m thick and display cross-\nstratification, graded and lenticular bedding, and laminated mudstone tops featuring \nripple structures. \n2.4 Molasse Succession \nThe Molasse Succession (Fig. 9) is characterised in the west by relatively un-\nmetamorphosed coarse conglomerates, and in the east by interbedded fine sandstones \nand muds.  \nThick channel-based conglomerates mixed with coarse sands (Fig. 9, log a) \ndominate the molasse succession.  The conglomerate beds are poorly sorted, \nheterolithic, with grain sizes ranging from granule to boulder.  The coarse sandstones \ncomprise both a matrix in areas dominated by conglomerate, and the main lithology \n10\nelsewhere, with scattered gravel-grade clasts.  Lenticular bed morphologies are \ncommon, especially in the conglomeratic units. \nIn the east of the Molasse Succession, thin, interbedded fine-sandstones and \nmudstones are prevalent in pairs around 10cm thick.  The transition from dominantly \nconglomerate to sandstones and mudstones is shown in Fig. 9, log b.  Intra-\nformational mudstone clasts and ripple structures are seen in the coarser bases of \nsome sandstone units (Fig. 9, log c).  \n2.5 Oyut Ulaan Volcanic group \nThe Oyut Ulaan Volcanic Group comprises 4 distinct formations in the south of \nthe Saykhandulaan Inlier.  The OUVG is the most volumetrically significant volcanic \nsuccession in the inlier, and its overall stratigraphic thickness exceeds 4000m.  Three \nof these formations occur in an area of relatively continuous outcrop in the south west \nof the inlier.  The fourth formation is exposed in the east, adjacent to the Oyut Ulaan \nintrusion (Fig. 5).  \nThe stratigraphically lowest, c.1500m thick, Gurvan Morin H\u00f6ndiy (Three \nHorse Valley) Formation is comprised of andesitic lavas interbedded with feldspathic \nsandstones and up-to 30m thick sequences of coarse conglomerates.  The \nconglomerates are heterolithic and feature volcanic, meta-sedimentary and intrusive \nlithologies.  One sandstone sequence contains lycopsid tree-bark impressions and \nlithified fragments near its base below several tabular sandstone beds.  Near the top of \nthe formation a conglomerate features bioclastic limestone clasts and crinoid \nfragments.  Pillow andesites also occur.  \nThe c.2000m thick Shargyn Moghai (Yellow Snake) Formation is above the \nGurvan Morin H\u00f6ndiy Formation.  It is comprised of a relatively monotonous \nsuccession of  basaltic andesites, basaltic trachyandesites and trachyandesites.  \n11\nLocally, boulder-grade conglomerates featuring volcanic, meta-sedimentary and \nintrusive lithologies occur but are laterally discontinuous.    \nThe c.1000m thick Tsagaan Nuruu (White Ridge) Formation is comprised of a \nnumber of distinctive 5-10 metre thick felsic lavas, which are blocky and crystalline, \nand form positive topography, interbedded with ca.60m-thick mudstone and \nsiltstones, which are sparsely exposed.  Near its top, between felsic lavas, the \nformation contains 2-3m thick basalt lavas and thinner intervals (25-35m) of  \nsandstone units and black, organic mudstones with plant fragments.   \nThe Yasun Eliy-e (Dead Vulture) Formation is isolated from the rest of the \ngroup stratigraphy in the east; it is vertically unconstrained and has a minimum \nthickness of 1500m.  It forms the host rocks to the Oyut Ulaan intrusion (Fig. 5) and \nis lithologically similar to the Ghurban Morin H\u00f6ndiy Formation, but does not display \nthick conglomerate sequences.  Volcanic sandstones and andesitic lithologies are \ndominant, with some basic lavas in the upper parts of the formation.   \nThe Yasun Eliy-e Formation is the only part of the OUVG to be cut by minor \nintrusions.  In the north, a 1m-wide olivine-phyric basalt dyke trends 130; south of \nthis, in the centre of the area a small dioritic intrusion with a roughly circular surface \nexpression, only 20m in diameter, cuts the volcanic-sedimentary succession. \nThe rocks of the OUVG are relatively un-metamorphosed and un-altered, \ncompared to the rest of the inlier.  Wall rock epidotisation locally occurs proximal to \nfaults, fractures and carbonate veins.\n2.6 Oyut Ulaan Intrusion \nThe Oyut Ulaan intrusion crops out in the southeast corner of the \nSaykhandulaan Inlier (Fig. 3).  It is elongate, around 10km east to west, and 3km \nnorth to south.  To the south, it is bordered by part of the Cretaceous rocks of the \n12\nZuunbayan basin, on other sides it is in intrusive contact with basement rocks of the \nSaykhandulaan Inlier.  The contact zone is rarely exposed; it is covered by drift in \nmost areas, but the margins of the intrusion are evident on satellite imagery (Fig. 5). \nThe main intrusion is cut by several dyke swarms, which have a range of \ncompositions and orientations.  A series of 1-100cm wide pink fine-grained felsic \ndykes run east-west parallel with the intrusion\u2019s long axis.  Five- to ten-metre thick \ndark-green andesite dykes cut the felsic dykes.  These are primarily observed in the \ncentral area of the intrusion.  Their general trend is northwesterly, but they form a \nradial set striking between 285 and 310. \nThe Oyut Ulaan intrusion and the surrounding country rocks host several \nmineralised features.  To the northeast of the main intrusion there is an E-W elongate \nseries of sulphide bearing quartz vein-stockworks within the volcanic country rock.  \nThe stockworks are hosted in potassically-altered andesite, and are adjacent to an \neast-west trending dyke.  A second mineralised feature occurs along the SE margin of \nthe intrusion within a zone of margin-parallel quartz veins and wall rock screens.  \nThis prospect consists of hard, silicified pods, surrounded by altered wall-rock that \nhas a visibly obvious malachite presence.  A tourmaline breccia-pipe cluster forms a \nseries of rounded black hills within the intrusion.  These hills are a topographic high \npoint and appear in stark contrast to the pink-white granite landscape surrounding \nthem.  The tourmaline breccia pipes are spatially associated with minor pegmatite \nbodies. Further discussion of the mineralisation is beyond the scope of this paper and \nis being prepared for separate publication.\n2.7 Mesozoic and Cenozoic cover sequences \nMesozoic basaltic lavas lie unconformably on the Northern Slate Belt.  The \nlargest areas of lava are on the northern margin of the NSB, and to the east near the \n13\njunction between the NSB, the eastern basin and the Saykhandulaan Valley \nLineament Zone (Figs. 3 and 4).  The lavas dip gently to the south and have layers \nbetween 5 and 10m thick, forming an extensive trap-topography.  Several smaller \nbasalt remnants sit on the NSB in various locations in the west.  Geodes and \namygdales are abundant within the Mesozoic lavas.\nIn several localities near the inlier, partially lithified Cretaceous sediments are \ndeformed and exposed.  The best example of this is on the southern margin of the \nbasin which lies to the east of the NSB.  Throughout the inlier interpreted faults that \nbound various lithological domains are generally hidden beneath recent alluvial cover \nsequences.\n3 Provenance data  \nThirteen samples from the Northern Slate Belt, High Strain Belt and Molasse \nSuccession were point-counted for sandstone provenance.  Several samples that were \nof an appropriate grain size for provenance work were discarded from this survey due \nto metamorphic grade and alteration.  Five hundred points were counted for each thin \nsection.  The results are plotted on a quartz-feldspar-lithics ternary diagram (fig. 10) \nand indicate that sediments of the NSB were derived from a cratonic source, whereas \nsediments in the HSB and MS were derived from volcanic arc domains, at different \nstages of evolution.\n4 Geochemical data \nSeventeen volcanic samples from the Saykhandulaan Valley Formation were \nanalysed using standard spectrometry techniques at the University of Leicester.  The \nformation contains a sequence of dominantly high-K, calc-alkaline lavas with \ncompositions that range from trachydacites and trachytes to rhyolites (Fig. 11).  The \nbulk of samples are rhyolites.  Harker variation diagrams (Fig. 12) illustrate some key \n14\ngeochemical characteristics and trends of the Saykhandulaan Valley Formation.  MgO \nand CaO both fall with increasing SiO2 and have distinctive changes in their \ngeochemical gradient, Al2O3 and Fe2O3 decrease linearly with increasing SiO2, these \nfeatures suggest early mafic and feldspar controlled fractionation.  Rb, Ba and Sr are \nscattered due to their post-emplacement mobility.  K2O and NaO2 values show more \nscatter than other results, however, trends are discernible; increasing K2O and \ndecreasing NaO2 with SiO2 is suggestive of albite fractionation.  Ba and Sr values \nsuggest that the Saykhandulaan Valley Formation may have evolved by fractional \ncrystallisation of feldspars and biotite.  The liquid line of descent originates from a \nsource chemically similar to the Oyut Ulaan granite (Fig. 13).\nEight analyses from known stratigraphic positions (Fig. 7) show evidence for \nsystematic variations in composition.  Plots of major and trace elements vs relative \nstratigraphic position show that there are consistent variations for several elements \nover time (Fig. 14).  K2O, Sr and Rb act compatibly, whereas the sequence becomes \nmore enriched in Y.  Other elements do not show discernible trends. \nMulti-element normalised diagrams for the Saykahndulaan Valley Formation \n(Fig. 15) show strong negative anomalies for Nb, Rb, Sr, P and Cr and positive \nanomalies for Th, Ba and Zr.  The negative Nb anomaly and high ratio of low-field-\nstrength-elements (LFSE) to high-field-strength-elements (HFSE) are both features \ntypical of subduction related volcanism (Fig. 15; Saunders et al., 1980; Wilson, 1989).  \nThe negative Sr and Rb anomalies may be linked to feldspar and biotite fractionation.  \nThe Ba, Zr and Th positive anomalies may be linked to cumulus potassic feldspar and \nzircon.\nField observations and petrographic analysis indicate widespread silicification \nin the lavas of the Saykhandulaan Valley.  Geochemical results support this \n15\nobservation; silica values between 76 and 80% are recorded for three samples (Fig. \n11).\nGraphical comparison of the trace element composition of an altered rock with \nits least-altered-equivalent allows the quantification of metasomatic processes that \naffected the altered sample (Grant, 1986).  It is assumed that the sample identified as \nleast-altered-equivalent has not undergone metasomatic alteration, and that, in the \naltered sample, Zr, Y, and Nb have remained relatively immobile.  Trace element \nresults for the two samples are plotted against each other, and a line of best fit, the \nisocon, is drawn through Zr, Y and Nb points.\nIsocon diagrams (Fig. 16; Grant, 1986) of Saykhandulaan Valley rocks show \nthat altered samples have undergone metasomatic enrichment of Rb, As and Ba.  \nZirconium, Y and Nb (along with other elements that plot on or near the isocon) have \nlower values in the altered samples than in the least-altered-equivalents; this suggests \nmass-gain has occurred, diluting the initial concentrations of these elements.  This \nprovides geochemical evidence that supports the interpretation that volumetrically \nsignificant secondary silicification has occurred.  Whilst post-emplacement \nmetasomatic mobility of trace elements may adversely affect petrogenetic analysis \n(e.g. Fig. 13), silicification may have modified the position of samples on the TAS \npetrological discrimination diagram, causing compositions to plot in more evolved \nfields (Fig. 11).\nThe Saykhandulaan Valley Formation is chemically similar to the Tsagaan \nNuruu Formation of the OUVG (Figs 11, 15).  It also overlaps with the more silicic \nparts (>60%) of the Gurvan Morin H\u00f6ndiy Formation (Fig. 11).  Further discussion of \nthe detailed geochemistry of the OUVG is beyond the scope of this paper, and is \nbeing prepared for separate publication.\n16\n5 Structural data \nThe strike of the dominant structural grain in the Saykhandulaan Inlier varies \nfrom 090 in the southwest, to 050 in the southeast and in the NSB.  Folding occurs \nthroughout the inlier and each litho-tectonic domain has a characteristic fold style.  \nCleavage is variably developed; the HSB and NSB display a widespread penetrative \ncleavage, whilst the MS, OUVG and rocks of the SVLZ are uncleaved or only \naffected by spaced cleavage.    \nAt first-order, the NSB consists of regional-scale west-plunging folds, the limbs \nof which form a \u2018Z\u2019 across the belt (Fig. 4).  Second-order folds occur on a scale of \n10-100 metres (Fig. 17).  These folds plunge to both the east and west.  Vergence \nvaries through the zone, appearing to fan around first-order folds, which are upright. \nThe HSB features tight-to-isoclinal steeply-inclined folds which plunge to the \neast and west and verge south (Fig. 18).  Fold closures were not directly observed in \nthe field, however some apparent closures and low angle truncation can be identified \non the aerial photograph in Fig. 5, and younging criteria prove the existence of fold \nhinges (Fig. 18).  Other folds were observed on Landsat imagery at the eastern end of \nthe HSB.\nBedding readings from the MS show gentle, upright, open folds (Fig. 9).  \nBedding becomes slightly steeper towards the northern boundary with the HSB (see \ncross section on fig. 9).\nThe folds in the OUVG are the most recognisable on the ground.  The three \nstratigraphically contiguous formations crop-out in the west in a first-order west-\nplunging syncline.  The Tsagaan Nuruu Formation crops-out in the centre of this \nsyncline (Fig. 19) and similar-style M-W folds in rhyolite lavas form positive \ntopography.  The northern limb of the syncline is truncated by east-west oriented \n17\nfaults.  Poles to bedding planes (Fig. 19) trace the profile-plane of this syncline.  Folds \nin OUVG have a slightly different trend from folds elsewhere in the inlier - striking \naround 090 (E-W) and plunging west.  \nWell developed axial planar cleavage characterises pelitic lithologies in both the \nNSB and HSB.  The different vergence directions of the NSB is reflected in the wide \nrange of cleavage orientations shown in fig. 17.  Cleavage-bedding intersection \nlineations which are a proxy for fold hinges, plunge both to the east and west (Fig. 17, \nstereoplot 2).  Cleavage is dominant in the south-east corner of the NSB, and is \ndeformed into tight, upright F2 folds.  Cleavage in the HSB is sub-parallel to bedding, \nand is steep and dominantly north dipping (Fig. 18, stereoplot 2).  The coarse and \nrelatively fresh lithologies of the MS do not contain a well developed cleavage, but \nwhere spaced cleavage was observed, it is near vertical and shows little variation \ncompared to other domains (Fig. 9).   \nRemote sensing imagery reveals many faults that cut the Saykhandulaan Inlier, \nhowever, because of the near peneplain relief of the entire inlier, comparatively few \nfaults have exposed surfaces with visible kinematic indicators.  One of the best-\nexposed faults is a brittle thrust that defines the northern edge of the HSB in the east, \nwhich has partially consolidated upturned Mesozoic sediments in the footwall (Fig. \n20c).  Oblique-slip faults are exposed near the southern margins of the molasse \nsuccession.  Both of these examples relate to post-Cretaceous fault movements at the \nboundary between Palaeozoic strata and Cretaceous basin sequences; although the \nfaults themselves could have formed earlier, and been subsequently reactivated.  \nWithin the Saykhandulaan Valley Lineament, north-dipping thrust faults crop-out in \nthe silicified rhyolitic units of the Saykhandulaan Valley Formation (Fig. 20a).  \nStriations indicating dip-slip movement are locally observed (Figs 21b, 22a).  Strike-\n18\nslip faults are not exposed at the surface and so those recorded in the field were \ninferred to be vertical because they from linear depressions and offset contacts and \nlithologies (Figs 21b-d).   \nInferred normal faults define the eastern and western edges of the inlier.  In the \nnortheast, a normal fault-bound Cretaceous basin lies along strike from the NSB.  The \nCretaceous basin is bordered to the south, by the HSB.  Where the Saykhandulaan \nValley Lineament Zone joins the basin, there are a number of fault bound troughs \npartially covered by onlapping Cretaceous sediments.  The basement to these small \ndepo-centres appears to be faulted blocks of the HSB (Fig. 5).\n6 Discussion\nThe Palaeozoic geological evolution of the Saykhandulaan Inlier is dominated \nby siliciclastic sedimentation in a wide variety of environments, with erupted \nsequences of volcanic rocks, arc-related plutonism and contractional deformation.  \nAlthough major questions remain about the overall geological evolution of Southeast \nMongolia, the lithological and structural data presented here provide the basis for the \nfirst detailed interpretation of basement rocks of Southeast Mongolia, and their terrane \ncontext.\nThe original depositional environment of the Northern Slate Belt pelitic and \npsammitic rocks is interpreted to represent a shelf-to-tidal shallowing-environment.  \nThe stratigraphically lowest parts of the NSB are interpreted to be exposed in the \nsoutheast, in the core of the west-plunging first-order anticline (Fig. 17).  The \ndominant protolith is mudstone, in upward-fining turbiditic sequences suggesting \ndeep marine sedimentation.  Coarser units and sedimentary features in the southwest, \nat higher stratigraphic levels, may represent a prograding fluvial or deltaic \nenvironment with the influence of both fluvial and wave processes.  Flame structures \n19\nin at the base of medium-grained sandstone units suggest loading onto soft, wet mud, \nand rapid accumulation of sediment.  Swaley cross stratification suggests a Palaeo-\ndepth of the upper zone of storm-wave influence (Tucker, 1991).  The uppermost \nparts of the stratigraphy are exposed in the northwest, in the first order syncline (Fig. \n17).  Psammitic units from throughout the NSB record a cratonic provenance (Fig. \n10).  The NSB is considered part of the Gobi Altai terrane, which is bordered to the \nnorth by passive margin and cratonic terranes (Fig. 1; Badarch, 2002). It is thus likely \nthat the cratonic source of the sediments that formed the protoliths to the NSB was in \nthis northern region. \nThe volcanic rocks of the Sakhandulaan Valley Formation have undergone \nconsiderable metasomatic alteration, related to fluids moving in the Saykhandulaan \nValley Lineament Zone.  The alteration makes accurate interpretation of primary \ngeochemical signatures problematic though not impossible.  Multi-element plots of \ntrace-elements suggest the succession is volcanic-arc related, and it is chemically \nsimilar to the upper parts of the OUVG.  It has, however, been more extensively \ndeformed and tectonised than the OUVG, and the thickness of the succession suggests \nit represents a far less extensive history of volcanism.   \nThe HSB is proximal to the NSB and of a relatively similar metamorphic grade \nand protolith.  However, the sediments that formed the HSB protolith have a dissected \ncontinental arc provenance and thus are probably south-derived (Fig. 10).  \nDeformation obscures original sedimentary structures in most areas, but locally \nyounging evidence was observed.  The coarse-conglomerate parts of the HSB, near \nthe Saykhandulaan valley, are interpreted to represent lower sections of the \nstratigraphy than the more voluminous sand- and granule-grade meta-clastic rocks to \nthe south.  The grain size range, cross-stratification and lenticular bedding suggest a \n20\nsand-dominated braided river system as the depositional environment for the bulk of \nthe HSB. \nThe Yasun Eliy-e Formation, though not in direct contact with the rest of the \nOUVG, is interpreted to be the oldest volcanic formation as it is the least evolved.  It \nhas lithological similarities to and geochemical overlap with the Gurvan Morin \nH\u00f6ndiy Formation, which is at the base of the contiguous volcanic stratigraphy in the \nwest (Fig. 5).\nIn the Ghurvan Morin H\u00f6ndiy Formation, various granite clasts in fan-\nglomerate successions that are intercalated with the volcanics suggest older, exhumed \narc-crust was eroded during the early stages of OUVG volcanicity.  It seems likely \nthat this partially dissected arc could be the same source as that for the sediments that \nwere the protolith to the HSB.  The difference in grain size may suggest that the \ndepositional environment of the HSB-protolith was further from the eroding source \nthan was the OUVG.  Pillow andesites and lycopsid tree bark in sandstone suggests a \nshallow marine to coastal terrestrial palaeo-environment during early stages of the \nOyut Ulaan volcanism.   \nThe Shargyn Moghai Formation is almost entirely dominated by thick trachy-\nandesitic sheets with little intervening material, this indicating probable high effusion \nrates.\nIn the Tsagaan Nuruu Formation, the succession is mainly composed of fine- to \nmedium-grained volcaniclastic deposits.  It is unclear whether the felsic lavas that \npunctuate this sequence are extrusive or hypabyssal in nature.  They appear to have \nhad a very large areal extent for felsic lavas, and were either particularly hot and of \nlow viscosity on extrusion; or were injected into the sediments laterally.  Sediments in \nthe upper parts of the succession also suggest a marine marginal environment. \n21\nThe poorly-sorted conglomerates of the MS represent a coarse-grained braided-\nriver system which drained the OUVG.  Fine sand and mudstone sequences may \nrepresent flood-related overbank sequences, or cyclic lake-sedimentation.  The MS \noccurs unconformably on rocks of the HSB.  Provenance data suggest the MS \nsediments were derived from an undissected arc of continental to intra-oceanic \naffinity (Fig. 10).  It is interpreted to be the youngest lithology of the inlier because it \nlies unconformably on the HSB and is un-metamorphosed and less deformed.   \nAt least four deformation events are recorded in the Saykhandulaan inlier.  D1 \nis expressed in the NSB as a regional folding and cleavage forming event under lower \ngreenschist grade metamorphic conditions.  D1 folds generally trend ENE.  Few \nPalaeozoic thrust surfaces were directly observed, however a few thrusts are \ntentatively interpreted from metamorphic breaks and fold asymmetry.  The upright \nfirst-order folds of the NSB feature several zones of abrupt vergence changes, these \nare interpreted to be the effects of either blind-thrusts or thrusts that break the surface, \nbut are obscured by drift (summary section; Fig. 17).  South of the NSB unambiguous \nevidence for D1 was not observed.\nD2 is a second contractional event, which has affected the entire inlier.  \nEvidence for D2 consists of F2 folds of S1 cleavage, local crenulation cleavage and \nkink banding in the NSB.  Quartz veins in the NSB postdate the formation of the S1\ncleavage, and may have been emplaced parallel to cleavage planes during D2.  The \nveins are spatially related to psammite units, which may have deformed in a brittle \nmanner compared to surrounding pelites, providing conduits for hot SiO2-rich \nsolutions.  Intense folding and greenschist grade metamorphism within the HSB may \nhave occurred during D1 and\/or D2; no F2 folds of cleavage were identified.  \n22\nSouth of the NSB, the Saykhandulaan Valley Lineament Zone is an important \ntopographic and structural boundary, separating arc related rocks to the south, from \nbasin sediments in the north.  The zone itself is a two-kilometre wide corridor of \ndistributed cataclastic deformation, discrete faulting and abundant silicification.  It is \ninterpreted that the SVLZ may represent a south-dipping thrust zone, which brought \nthe highest-grade rocks of the area (the HSB) to the surface during D1 and\/or D2, \nentraining slivers of the Saykhandulaan Valley Formation in its base.  Some minor \nnorth-dipping thrust surfaces are seen in the SVLZ, these are interpreted to be \nbackthrusts.   \nThe Molasse Succession and Oyut Ulaan Volcanic Formation have undergone \nthe least deformation.  The Molasse Succession has fold orientations that match those \nof the underlying HSB, but the folding is far less intense.  Orientations of folds in the \nOUVG suggest it may have been affected by N-S shortening in contrast to the NNW-\nSSE directed compression seen in the rest of the inlier (Figs. 9, 19).  Folding in the \nOUVG is interpreted to have occurred during D2 because the sequence lacks cleavage \nand evidence for metamorphism which are typical of D1 deformation to the north.  \nGentle folding in the MS is interpreted to be a late stage expression of D2.\nThe Oyut Ulaan intrusion, which is emplaced in the lowermost and least-\nevolved parts of the OUVG, is elongate in a direction parallel to the axial trace of \nfolds in the OUVG.  The granite may have been affected by the same N-S directed \nshortening as the OUVG, but more evidence is needed to confirm this.  Preliminary \nunpublished U-Pb zircon dates indicate that the Oyut Ulaan intrusion has a mid-\nCarboniferous emplacement age (publication in prep., Blight et al.).  This is consistent \nwith regional evidence for Devonian-Carboniferous arc magmatism throughout \nsouthern Mongolia (Lamb and Badarch, 2001). \n23\nD3 represents Jurassic-Cretaceous crustal extension widespread in the region \n(Graham et al. 2001).  Normal faults that cut the inlier and bound Cretaceous basins \naround the inlier are likely to have formed during D3.   \nSome strike slip faults that cut the inlier including the SVLZ cut all older \nstructures and are therefore suspected of being the youngest faults in the region, and \nrepresent a fourth deformation event, D4 .  Recorded sinistral minor faults, and major \nfaults interpreted to have sinistral offsets trend 030-070, interpreted dextral antithetic \nshears trend around 160 (Fig. 22).  Orientations of faults recorded in the field, and \ninterpreted on satellite imagery (Fig. 22) suggest a sinistral Riedel-shear deformation \nregime during the Late Cretaceous or Tertiary.  These fault displacements may have \nbeen co-genetic with brittle sinistral movements on the nearby Zuunbayan Fault (Fig. \n1(Lamb et al., 1999) during the Late Cretaceous or Tertiary.   \nThe recognition that the Saykhandulaan inlier contains a southern volcanic arc \ncomplex and a northern deformed and metamorphosed marine basin assemblage, \nsheds light on the regional scale tectonic events that were responsible for crustal \ngrowth in southeast Mongolia.  The shortening and metamorphism within the NSB \nindicates closure and inversion of the basin between an arc to the south and a \ncontinental block to the north.  No evidence for subduction, ophiolite obduction or \naccretionary prism development exists during closure of the NSB basin.  Therefore, it \nis unlikely that the NSB basin was ever floored by oceanic crust and instead is \ninterpreted to have been ensialic.  The polarity of subduction beneath the arc-complex \nin the southern inlier was therefore probably north directed, consistent with other \nregional interpretations within the CAOB of Palaeo-Asian Ocean closure (Fig.2; \n\u0002eng\u00f6r and Natal'in 1996; Badarch et al. 2002).  Apart from local en echelon-vein \narrays in the NSB, little evidence was observed for the Palaeozoic large-scale dextral \n24\nmovements postulated in the models of both \u0002eng\u00f6r and Natal\u2019in (1996) and Badarch \net al. (2002).  Any major strike-slip displacements within the inlier were probably \nfocused along the SVLZ and adjacent HSB, which represent the composite terrane \nboundary between the Gobi Altai and Mandalovoo terranes.\n7 Conclusions\nThe Saykhandulaan inlier provides a window into the Palaeozoic evolution of \nthe northern margin of the Palaeo-Asian Ocean in southeast Mongolia.  Five major \nlithotectonic domains are distinguished that help elucidate the crustal evolution in the \nregion.  More than four thousand metres of volcanic rocks with arc geochemical \nsignatures are documented, and the intrusion of the mineralised Oyut Ulaan granite \nsuggest subduction-related magmatism.  Two major deformation events are recorded \nrelated to basin closure, inversion and accretion of the Mandalovoo arc-terrane.  Basin \nclosure involved regional scale folding and greenschist grade metamorphism.  \nFollowing terrane accretion and cessation of subduction, crustal extension and strike-\nslip faulting have further modified the crustal architecture of the inlier.  The results \npresented here provide a useful framework for understanding the crustal evolution of \nadjacent regions within the southeast Gobi mineral belt. \n8 Acknowledgements \nResearch reported in this article was supported by the National Environmental \nResearch Council, UK, the Society of Economic Geologists, the University of \nLeicester and Ivanhoe Mines Ltd.

Deposition of the protolith to the NSB occurs in a back-arc basin fed by \nsediments from the passive margin of a craton to the north.  In the south, a \nrifted continental arc is eroded and provides sediments for the protolith to the \nHSB.\nb. Volcanism continues, sediments that compose the HSB protolith are buried \nand N-S compressive deformation begins (D1) as back-arc basin closes.\nc. D1 strain is focussed in the HSB, which is tightly folded at depth.  Thrusting \nensues, with the main thrust zone exploiting the Saykhandulaan Formation as \na brittle d\u00e9collement.  The HSB is thrusted over the NSB which displays \nupright folds, and discrete zones of northern vergence, interpreted to be related \n31\nto further south dipping thrusts.  The Saykhandulaan Formation forms a \nduplex in the thrust zone.  To the south, the lower lavas of the OUVG are \nerupted and interbedded with conglomerates derived from the dissected old \ncontinental-arc crust.  \nd. A second deformation with similar principle stress axes folds the newly \nformed OUVG and the S1 cleavage in the NSB is folded proximal to the \nSaykahdulaan Thrust.  Back-thrusting occurs in the thrust zone and cuts the \nHSB.  Fluid flow along the Saykhandulaan thrust silicifies the lithologies \nwithin the zone, and is focussed in giant quartz veins in parts of the NSB.  To \nthe south the Oyut Ulaan intrusion is emplaced and the OUVG is uplifted and \neroded.\ne. Some oblique slip motion occurs on faults formed parallel to steep cleavage \ndomains in the NSB and HSB.  Parts of the OUVG are displaced laterally out \nof section.  The OUVG forms the sediment source for intermontane molasse \nbasins to its north.  Subsequently molasse is gently folded and acquires a \nvague space cleavage.    \n32\n9 References \nBadarch, G., Cunningham, W. D., Windley, B. F., 2002.
