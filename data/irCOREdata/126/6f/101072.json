INTRODUCTION\nMany-body theory based on the independent-particle shell\nmodel has enjoyed great success in interpreting nuclear\nstructure. As usually applied, it makes the problem numeri-\ncally tractable by introducing truncated orbital spaces. Inside\nthese, the physical interactions are replaced by effective in-\nteractions, tailored to reproduce experimental data, such as\nmasses and excitation energies. Imposing these restrictions\nexcludes probability from states at higher energies, thereby\ninflating the populations within the truncated model space.\nThe wave functions now describe quasiparticles, and matrix\nelements and occupancies may differ systematically from the\nobserved values [1]. In the present work, the absolute occu-\npancy of the 1s1\/2 neutron halo state of 15C is investigated\nthrough a precise measurement of spectroscopic factors in\nthe reaction 9Bes15C, 14CdX. This is an especially favorable\ncase in which the contributions from configuration mixing\nare well understood and expected to be small.\nII. ABSOLUTE SPECTROSCOPIC FACTORS OF WEAKLY\nBOUND SYSTEMS\nExperiments on stable nuclei, mainly for cases involving\nclosed shells, have shown that strength is missing relative to\nthe predictions of effective-interaction theory. Although a\nquantitative description is not yet available, this effect is be-\nlieved to be caused by components of the nucleon-nucleon\ninteraction that are absent in the usual nuclear models, such\nas the repulsive hard core and the tensor force terms [2].\nOther effects not included in central-field models such as\nclustering could also contribute to this effect. We denote the\nempirical reduction factor by the symbol Rs, which is, of\ncourse, a model-dependent quantity. An illustrative first ex-\nample has been provided by the 7Lise ,e8pd6He reaction, for\nwhich the sum of the measured spectroscopic factors to the\ntwo lowest states is 0.58(5), in excellent agreement with the\nvalue 0.60 obtained in a variational Monte Carlo calculation\nthat starts from realistic nucleon-nucleon forces [3]. The\nCohen-Kurath spectroscopic factor based on a p-shell space\nand including a center-of-mass correction of 7 \/6 gives es-\nsentially twice this value, 1.16, so that here we have Rs\n=0.50. The proton knockout reaction with high-energy elec-\ntron beams has been employed over the past two decades to\nstudy absolute spectroscopic factors for proton states in\nstable nuclei over a broad mass region [4], and has consis-\ntently found similar values for Rs, of the order of 0.5\u20130.6\nrelative to shell-model and mean-field models that use effec-\ntive interactions.\nIt is only recently that evidence has emerged [5,6] that\nnucleon knockout reactions with heavy ions, at intermediate\nenergies and in inverse kinematics, offer new possibilities for\nstudying absolute spectroscopic factors. The strength of this\napproach lies in the accurate understanding of the (unit)\nsingle-particle cross sections ssp (i.e., corresponding to a\nspectroscopic factor of 1), which serve to convert measured\npartial cross sections to experimental spectroscopic factors.\nThe calculations of ssp rely on the high-energy limit of re-\naction theory, based on eikonal methods. These offer formal,\npractical, and quantitative advantages over conventional\ntransfer-reaction approaches [7\u20139]. The proton states of the\nstable p-shell nuclei 12C and 16O were found by this method\nto have Rs values of 0.57(2) and 0.68(4) [5] in good agree-\nment with what had been obtained from the se ,e8pd reaction.\nHowever, the method is equally applicable to neutron states;\nthe values for the same two nuclei were 0.52(2) and 0.56(3),\nrespectively. This is a new result but, of course, what should\nbe expected from isospin symmetry. The results for Rs for the\ntwo radioactive nuclei, 8B and 9C, were considerably higher,\n0.872(12) (weighted average over five measured values) and\n0.82(6), respectively [5,6]. The values closer to unity are,\n*Present address: Institut f\u00fcr Kernphysik, Technische Universit\u00e4t,\nDarmstadt, Germany.\n\u2020Electronic address: hansen@nscl.msu.edu\nPHYSICAL REVIEW C 69, 054306 (2004)\n0556-2813\/2004\/69(5)\/054306(5)\/$22.50 \u00a92004 The American Physical Society69 054306-1\nmost likely, associated with the low proton binding for the\ntwo nuclei, 0.14 and 1.3 MeV, respectively. If so, the effect\nwould not have been observable in se ,e8pd work, which\ncould only investigate more bound stable targets. It is clearly\nof interest to investigate other weakly bound cases. However,\nalthough many partial cross sections have been investigated\nin knockout reactions [9\u201311], the majority do not fulfill the\nstringent experimental and theoretical requirements for a pre-\ncise determination of Rs.\nThe single-neutron knockout on the nucleus 15Cs 12\n+d lead-\ning to the 0+ ground state of 14C presents an almost ideal\ncase for a precision test. The initial state is halolike with a\nneutron separation energy of only 1.218 MeV. Shell-model\ncalculations indicate very weak configuration mixing for this\nstate. The p -sd interaction set given by Warburton and\nBrown [12], referred to as WBT, gives a spectroscopic factor\nof 0.983, very close to the sum-rule value of unity for a pure\n1s1\/2 state. Other sets give very similar values. Therefore, the\nsensitivity to the structure model should be small. The reac-\ntion is also very favorable from an experimental point of\nview. The reaction has been studied at 54 MeV\/nucleon and\nthe spectroscopic factors were discussed [13]. The most in-\nteresting result was a deviation in the shape of the knockout\nmomentum distribution, which was attributed to non-eikonal\neffects in the diffractive-breakup channel. However, in spite\nof this, the integrated single-particle cross section could be\naccounted for in eikonal theory. From this work it is also\nknown that about 25% of the reaction populates excited\nstates in 14C. Determining the intensity of these branches\nwith a \u00b110% error will then determine the branching ratio to\nthe ground state to a comfortable error of \u00b12.5%. This\nbranching ratio combines with an accurately determined in-\nclusive s15C, 14Cd cross section to give the partial cross sec-\ntion of interest.\nIt was decided to perform the precise determination of the\npartial cross section at an incident energy of\n103 MeV\/nucleon. Using a higher energy than in the experi-\nment of Ref. [13] brings experimental advantages, which in-\nclude the possibility of using a thicker target and, very im-\nportantly, a marked improvement in the acceptance of the\nspectrograph, both with respect to angle and transmitted mo-\nmentum bite. On the theoretical side, the analysis becomes\nsafer because the precision of eikonal reaction theory im-\nproves with increasing projectile energy, but this no longer\nseems an important issue. We note in this connection that\nfive separate experiments on 8B obtained consistent spectro-\ncopic factors within a range of beam energies from 0.076 to\n1.4 MeV\/nucleon [6].\nIII. EXPERIMENT AND DATA ANALYSIS\nTwo separate experiments were carried out at the National\nSuperconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at MSU. In\nthe first, a secondary beam of 103 MeV\/nucleon 15C was\nproduced by fragmentation of a 150 MeV\/nucleon 17O pri-\nmary beam on a thick beryllium target and subsequently pu-\nrified by magnetic analysis in the A1200 fragment separator\n[14]. This beam was transported to the target position of the\nS800 spectrograph [15], where it interacted with a\n149 mg\/cm2 beryllium target. The residues were analyzed in\nthe spectrograph in coincidence with prompt gamma emis-\nsions detected in an array of 11 position-sensitive NaI detec-\ntors [16]. The spectrograph was operated in dispersion\nmatched mode for maximum momentum resolution at the\nfocal plane. A detailed discussion of techniques and analysis\nin this part of the experiment has been given in connection\nwith a study of other radioactive carbon isotopes [17]. The\ninclusive cross section, obtained from the number of detected\nresidues relative to the number of incident 15C projectiles,\nwas 137.0s71d mb without acceptance corrections. These are\ndiscussed below.\nThe coincident gamma-ray spectrum, shown in Fig. 1,\nwas fit GEANT-simulated response functions, which account\nfor the efficiency of the detector array and distortions in the\nresponse function due to the Doppler effect. Gamma ray en-\nergies for this calculation are taken from previous work [27].\nTo quantify the accuracy of the simulation, a calibration run\nwith stationary radioactive sources was carried out; for this,\nthe simulated data agree in intensity with the actual data at\nan uncertainty level of 10%. The fit to the gamma spectrum\nalso included a previously observed continuum distribution.\nThe intensity and shape of this distribution are consistent\nwith measurements [17] of single-neutron removal from 12Be\nand 16C, for which there are no gammas above 1 MeV. Fur-\nther, the fit includes a small contribution from a 0.98 MeV\nstationary-source gamma ray associated with a 8Li contami-\nnation in the target. The fit shown in the figure leads to\napparent absolute (not acceptance corrected) gamma intensi-\nties of 4.32s50d%, 22.4s23d%, and 3.4s10d% for the 0.809,\n6.092, and 7.010 MeV peaks, respectively. (The intensities\nare reported relative to the number of observed residues).\nThe input-output intensity balance leads to apparent popula-\ntion branches (again not corrected for acceptance) of\nFIG. 1. The g-ray spectrum from the reaction 9Bes15C, 14C\n+gdX (filled circles) transformed, event by event, to the projectile\nframe at midtarget. The response functions for each gamma energy\narising from this analysis have been obtained in the Monte Carlo\nsimulation. The approximately exponential component is the con-\ntinuum contribution ascribed to neutrons and gamma rays from the\ntarget. Its intensity and shape has been taken from [17]. The inset\nshows the simplified level scheme of 14C indicating the states popu-\nlated in this reaction.\nJ. R. TERRY et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 69, 054306 (2004)\n054306-2\n74.2s25d%, 18.1s23d%, 4.32s50d%, and 3.4s10d% for the 0+,\n1\u2212, 0\u2212, and 2+ states, respectively.\nDuring the measurement of the inclusive 9Bes15C, 14CdX\ncross section, the incident beam and the reaction residues are\nobserved at different field settings and, therefore, different\ntimes. The rate and composition must be carefully monitored\nto safeguard against drift. Since the measurement of the in-\nclusive 9Bes15C, 14CdX cross section represents the most\ndelicate part of the present high-precision study, it was de-\ncided to repeat this at the NSCL\u2019s Coupled-Cyclotron Facil-\nity. As the new setup employed a high-purity germanium\narray for gamma detection with a relatively low efficiency at\n6 MeV as compared to the NaI array used in the first experi-\nment, and since the run was short, there were not enough\nstatistics to allow a remeasurement of the branching ratios. A\nsecondary beam of 15C at 103 MeV\/nucleon was produced\nby fragmentation of 40Ar and purified in the A1900 fragment\nseparator [18]. The secondary beam interacted with a beryl-\nlium target with nominal thickness of 376 mg\/cm2 located at\nthe target position of the S800. The target thickness was\ndetermined independently by measuring the magnetic fields\nrequired to bring a 30Si beam to the final focus of the S800\nspectrograph with and without the target. From the energy\nloss, a target thickness of 375s4d mg\/cm2 was found. The\nS800 was operated in focused mode, which gives a higher\nevent rate and a more sharply defined beam spot on the tar-\nget. Particle identification was achieved by selection on en-\nergy loss versus time of flight to the focal plane of the spec-\ntrograph. The time of flight was corrected for trajectory\ndependence yielding a very clean identification of the 14C\nevents with an error of 2.3% attributed to the selection of the\nresidues. Other contributions to the error on the inclusive\ncross section are 1.5% from the normalization to the incident\nbeam, 1% from the target thickness, 0.6% from the live time\nof the data recording, and 0.9% from counting statistics. The\nresulting apparent inclusive cross section for single-neutron\nremoval was 133.0s41d mb, in agreement with the value\n137.0s71d mb obtained in the first measurement. We repre-\nsent the two independent results by a weighted average of\n134.0s36d mb, and now introduce the corrections for mo-\nmentum acceptance. Since the shapes of the momentum dis-\ntributions are ,-dependent (high , values have broader dis-\ntributions), this required use of the coincidence data.\nAcceptance corrections for detection of reaction residues\nwere determined in a Monte Carlo calculation employing the\nCOSY Infinity code for tracking charged particles through\nthe S800 spectrograph. Because of the relatively high energy\nin this experiment, the angular acceptance is essentially com-\nplete, and the corrections depend on the longitudinal momen-\ntum distributions in coincidence with gamma rays measured\n(and calculated) as in [13] with the ground-state momentum\ndistribution being obtained as a difference. The contribution\nfrom the continuum distribution in Fig. 1 was extracted by\ngating in the Eg region between the 0.809 and 6.092 MeV\npeaks, where the continuum distribution dominates the spec-\ntrum. All the momentum distributions were weighted with\nfactors extracted from the gamma fit. Statistics in the\n7.010 MeV peak, associated with the 2+ state, were too small\nto yield a momentum distribution, but we assume the theo-\nretical ,=2 shape. (For measured shapes from d-wave re-\nmoval in the same mass range, see [17].) The resulting ac-\nceptance corrections are 1.4s10d% for the 0+ state (s-wave\nremoval), 13s8d% for the 0\u2212\/1\u2212 states (p-wave removal), and\n20s10d% for the 2+ state. Applying the corrections to the\nmeasured relative cross sections leads to an acceptance cor-\nrection factor of 1.046(20) to the inclusive cross section,\nwhich becomes 140.2s46d mb at 103 MeV\/nucleon. The cor-\nresponding partial cross sections and branching ratios are\ngiven in Table I. We have used the experimental spectro-\nscopic factors defined by the results of Table I for calculating\nthe cross sections and branching ratios that would have been\nobtained in the experiment at 54 MeV\/nucleon [13]. The\nagreement turns out to be very good for the branching ratios.\nHowever, the calculated inclusive cross section comes out as\n163s5d mb, less than two standard deviations above the re-\nported 54-MeV value of 137(16). We take this as an indica-\ntion of a possible systematic error. The new measurement is\nclearly more accurate and should supersede that at\n54 MeV\/nucleon.\nTABLE I.

THEORETICAL ANALYSIS\nThe calculation of theoretical spectroscopic reference\ncross sections combine shell-model theory based on effective\ninteractions with eikonal reaction theory. For a given final\nlevel identified by Ip, the cross section can be be written\nsthsIpd = S AA \u2212 1D\nN\nS ssps,,Bnd , s1d\nwhere the A-dependent term is a center-of-mass correction\nf19g, N is the oscillator quantum number for the orbital in\nquestion, S is the spectroscopic factor, and ssps, ,Bnd is the\nsunitd single-particle cross section. Since the latter in our\nanalysis depends essentially on the orbital angular mo-\nmentum , and the neutron binding energy Bn, we have, for\nthe 1\u2212 and 2+ states in Table I, combined the two j com-\nponents to give a single spectroscopic factor S. sThe domi-\nnant components in the two cases are 88% 0p1\/2, and\n89% 0d5\/2, respectively.d As described in f7\u20139g, the\nsingle-particle cross sections were calculated in a three-\nbody eikonal model based on the approximation that the\nsA\u22121d-body residue acts as a spectator, so that it is at most\nscattered elastically by the target. The nucleon-residue\nrelative motion is calculated as an energy eigenstate of an\neffective two-body Hamiltonian containing a Woods-\nSaxon potential with a depth adjusted to reproduce the\nsum of the nucleon separation energy and the excitation\nenergy of the final state. The residue-core and nucleon-\ncore interactions are expressed in terms of elastic S matri-\nces.\nThe elastic S matrices for the reactions of the nucleon and\nthe core (reaction residue) were obtained from the eikonal\nmodel by single and double folding, respectively, of the\nnucleon-nucleon interaction. The nuclear matter distributions\nwere assumed to be Gaussian. For the excited states in 14C,\nthe core S matrix was calculated with the composite-core\nprescription [7] to correct for the presence of the halo neu-\ntron as a spectator in the reaction residue. Based on a 13C\nradius of 2.29 fm, this reduces the single-particle cross sec-\ntion for the 1\u2212 level from 30.9 mb to the value of 29.0 mb\ngiven in Table I. For the ground state, the values RC\n=2.36s5d and RT=2.37s1d for the matter radii of the core and\nof the target, respectively, were taken as the average of (con-\nsistent) values obtained from the charge radii [25] corrected\nfor the proton charge radius of 0.85 fm, and from the inter-\naction cross sections [26].\nThe simple and accurate description of the knockout re-\naction is linked to the surface dominance of the reaction\nmechanism. The fraction of the neutron wave function\nsampled in the reaction can be estimated to be 28%, obtained\nas the ratio of the stripping cross section (6.21 mb, discussed\nbelow) to the total reaction cross section for a free neutron,\n228 mb. As a result of this surface dominance, treatments\nthat use a different description of the nuclear interior give\nvery similar overall results [8]. To allow for a general com-\nparison of results from single-nucleon removal studies, a\nstandard for the core-nucleon interaction is required. The\nearly, less precise spectroscopic work, see [10], characterized\nthe shape of the core-nucleon potential well with a fixed set\nof Woods-Saxon parameters, referred to as the \u201cstandard set\u201d\n[5]. However, the recent work on absolute spectroscopic fac-\ntors [5,6], requiring an improvement in precision, has relied\non electromagnetic properties such as higher moments of the\ncharge radii and Coulomb displacement energies for fixing\nthese parameters in special cases. As such data are not avail-\nable for a large number of nuclides, we shall argue here that\na more general approach for precision studies is to use self-\nconsistent Hartree-Fock calculations to fix the Woods-Saxon\nparameters.\nBefore we discuss Hartree-Fock calculations, it is impor-\ntant to consider the three parameters that we wish to fix. The\ndepth of the nucleon-residue potential well is an important\nparameter in surface-dominated processes due to its influ-\nence on the asymptotic behavior of the wave function. This\nparameter is fixed precisely by the binding energy of the\nsingle-particle orbit, which is the sum of the neutron separa-\ntion energy and excitation energy of the final state (as de-\nscribed above). The last two parameters describe the extent\nand shape of the distribution, typically defined as a radius\nand a diffuseness. However, a numerical study of the sensi-\ntivity of single-particle cross sections to these parameters by\nmeans of finite-difference derivatives has revealed that more\nnatural coordinates for this calculation are the rms radius of\nthe orbit and the diffuseness of the potential well [9]. Calcu-\nlated single-particle cross sections become insensitive to the\ndiffuseness of the potential once the rms radius is fixed. This\nis illustrated in our final calculations below. In these calcu-\nlations we fix the diffuseness at a reasonable value of 0.5 fm.\nModern Hartree-Fock (HF) calculations based on Skyrme\nparametrizations provide a quantitative agreement with ex-\nperiment for a number of parameters related to nuclear size.\nWe use here the recent parameter set SKX [20], which has\nbeen determined from a large set of data on spherical nuclei,\nincluding nuclei far from stability. With this it has been pos-\nsible to account for the binding-energy differences between\nmirror nuclei [21], interaction cross sections [22], and the\nnuclear charge distributions [23]. The good agreement with a\nlarge body of data suggests that the theory will also give a\ngood description of the radial distribution of individual or-\nbits. Due to the strong sensitivity of the single-particle cross\nsection to the binding energy, if is necessary in the HF cal-\nculation to scale the central potential by a number near unity\nto reproduce this quantity for the orbital in question. Since\nthe HF radius is defined with a fixed center of the nucleus, a\nconversion is required to find the radius of the single particle\norbit in core-nucleon coordinates. This relation is given by\nRsp\n2\n= kr2l = S AA \u2212 1DkrHF2 l . s2d\nThe calculated Hartree-Fock radius for the 1s1\/2 state of\n15C is 5.01 fm, which translates into a two-body rms distance\nof 5.185 fm. With the diffuseness fixed at a=0.5 fm, the rms\nis reproduced by the Woods-Saxon parameter r0=1.223 fm.\nWith this choice we obtain for a 103 MeV\/nucleon 15C pro-\njectile on a 9Be target a contribution from stripping of\n62.1 mb and from diffraction dissociation 34.5 mb. The lat-\nter result is based on a sum rule which assumes no bound\nJ. R. TERRY et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 69, 054306 (2004)\n054306-4\nexcited states [28]. This should be an excellent approxima-\ntion for 15C since it has only one bound excited state. To this\ncross section we must add a small contribution from Cou-\nlomb dissociation, calculated to be 2.9 mb [24], leading to\nthe (unit) single-particle cross section of 99.4 mb given in\nTable I. The cross sections for the 1\u2212 state are based on an\nRsp of 3.167 fm yielding the Woods-Saxon parameters\n(1.402,0.5), which were also used for the two small cross\nsections. As a check on the procedure, we calculated the 1s1\/2\ncross section with the Woods-Saxon diffuseness increased to\na=0.55. The same value for Rsp is obtained by choosing r0\n=1.113 fm, which leads to stripping and diffraction cross\nsections of 62.1 and 34.3 mb, a change of \u22120.2%.\nThe precision in the calculation of the theoretical unit\ncross sections (given as the sum of the contributions from\nstripping and diffraction dissociation) may be estimated from\nfinite-difference derivatives\ndssp\nssp\n= 0.44dRsp \u2212 0.04da \u2212 0.31dRC \u2212 0.31dRT, s3d\nwith the coefficients in fm\u22121. This shows that the cross\nsection is insensitive to the choice of the diffuseness pa-\nrameter a. With estimated errors on the single-particle rms\nradius and the diffuseness of 0.1 fm, and with errors on\nthe radii of 0.05 fm, the resulting mean-square error on the\nunit cross section is 5%, comparable to the experimental\nerror. For the more deeply bound 1\u2212 state, the relative\nerror is 8.5%, mainly associated with the radius of the\nsingle-particle orbital scoefficient 0.85 fm\u22121d, while the\ncoefficients describing the dependence on the nuclear ra-\ndii are only 0.02 fm\u22121.\nV. CONCLUSION\nIn order to compare the experimental result for the 1s1\/2\nknockout to the ground state with effective-interaction\ntheory, we introduce the quenching factor defined in [5,6],\nRs =\nsexp\nsth\n= 0.90s4ds5d , s4d\nwhere the first quantity in parentheses is the experimental\nerror sstandard deviationd and the second represents our es-\ntimate of the uncertainty on the unit cross section. The result\nis similar to those for 8B and 9C discussed in Sec. II and\nconfirms that halolike states have quenching factors ap-\nproaching unity. This is what one would intuitively expect\nfor a neutron in a very large s-state halo. As such states\nextend far beyond the core of the nucleus, their behavior\nmust approach that of a free particle.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by the U.S. National Science\nFoundation under Grant Nos.
