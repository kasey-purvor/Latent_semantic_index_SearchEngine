MOTIVAT ION,  STATEMENT,  AND DERIVAT ION OF  RESULT  \nIf a uniform transonic or supersonic gas flow is incident on a thin wing or a slender igid body, \nand the resulting as flow contains only weak shocks, with strengths of order e, then the entropy \nchanges at those shocks are of order e 3. In the flow behind the shocks, Crocco's theorem (~TAu)Au \n= T~TS then shows that the components of vorticity perpendicular to u are also of order e3. \nHowever, Crocco's theorem does not directly give us the component of vorticity parallel to u. \nOne way to see that this is also of order e 3 is to use a circulation theorem that is valid in the \npresence of shocks, which is the subject of this note. \nWe consider the flow of a simple inviscid gas, governed by the compressible Euler equation, \nand with shocks at which the Rankine-Hugoniot relations hold. In such a flow, we consider the \ncirculation F -- fc(t) u.dx around a closed curve C(t) moving with the flow, and we shall show \nthat \n- -  = TdS,  (1) \ndt (t) \nwhere T is the absolute temperature, S is the entropy per unit mass, and the prime on the \nintegral on the right indicates that it is only taken along the smooth sections of the flow between \nthe shocks, excluding the entropy jumps at the shocks. The result is, of course, well known if \nthe flow has no shocks [1, Chapter I, Exc. 7]: it is the extension to include shocks that we are \ninterested in here. As with Kelvin's circulation theorem, the flow may be unsteady, and the \ncurve C(t) may encircle obstructions in the flow. \n0893-9659\/04\/$ - see front matter (~) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Then, we shall show that X + = X~\" using the Rankine-Hugoniot equations, \nand consequently summing (2) over i will give the result (1). \nTo establish (2), we shall use a transport theorem for an integral along a curve C(t) from P(t) \nto Q(t), where C(t) is convected with the local flow velocity u, but the ends P and Q do not \nnecessarily move with the local gas velocity. We need this because in our application each P~ \nis determined by the intersection of a shock with C(t), and so although the material curve is \nconvected with the flow, P and Q are also sliding along it as it moves. \nThe result we require is \nd \/ \/  fpQ(aa  ) ~ a.dx = a(Q).Q - a(P).P + -~ + (V A a) A u .dx, (3) \nwhich is a slight modification of more familiar transport results in the literature (e.g., [2, p. 269]). \nTo show (3), suppose at some time t' - t + ~t the point P has moved to pt, and that the gas \nelement hat coincided with P at t has moved to P\", as indicated in Figure 2. With similar \nnotation for Q, we then have \na(x, t ') .dx - \/p  a(x , t ) .dx=\/QQ,Qa(x , t ) .dx+\/p,p , ,pa(x , t ) .dx  (4) \nJ\/ \/o + (a(x, t') - a(x, t)).dx + a(x, t).dx.

When 5t is small, we can think of that surface as composed of individual \nelements with vector area uht A dx as illustrated in Figure 2. Thus, when we divide by 5t and \nlet 5t --* O, we obtain \nCirculation 769 \nQ, \nQ I !  \nr \nP \nFigure 2.

(7) \nP \nHere, we have used Euler's equation, and then introduced the enthalpy per unit mass H.

To show that X + : X~-, \nwe focus on a single shock and drop the subscript i. Let the unit normal to the shock at P be n, \nand the shock speed V, and then the condition that P remains on the shock is 15.n = V. So we \ncan write \n1 2 1 \n: (u (P\u00b1)An) . ( 'An) - (H(P\u00b1)+~ (u(p i ) .n -V)2)+2V2-1  lu(P\u00b1)An]2. (10) \nHere, the first and last terms are unchanged across the shock, by continuity of tangential velocity, \nu(P +) A n : u (P - )  A n. The second term is also unaltered across the shock, by the Rankine- \nHugoniot energy condition, so X + : X{- as required. \n2. D ISCUSSION,  EXTENSIONS,  AND L IMITAT IONS \nThis result is obviously closely related to Kelvin's circulation theorem for barotropic flows, to \nBjerknes' theorem, and to Crocco's theorem, but has the added feature of allowing shocks in the \nflow. We mention some potential applications. \n(1) In the circumstances mentioned in the opening paragraph, when we apply (1) to any \nclosed material curve in the incident gas, it shows that the circulation will only become \nof order c 3 after crossing the weak shocks, and so the vorticity in the resulting flow is of \norder c 3 as expected. \n770 D. J .  ALLWRIGHT AND K. KAOURI  \n\\ \u00b0 \nFigure 3. Steady flow with a curved shock. \n(2) When a uniform supersonic gas flow is incident on a body and the resulting steady flow \ncontains curved shocks, and therefore, entropy gradients behind the shocks, (1) gives an \nexplicit result for the development of circulation. \nFor instance, in the situation shown in Figure 3, where DA and CB are streamlines, \nthe circulation F around the material curve ABCD develops according to \nd--t = T dS. (11) \nOf course, Crocco's theorem already tells us that there must be nonzero vorticity behind \nthe shock in this situation. \n(3) Another potential use of the result would be as an additional accuracy check on numerical \ncalculations. \nThe result remains valid if the gas is subject o a conservative force field such as gravity, since \nif U is the gravitational potential, we simply have an additional -VU on the right of Euler's \nequation, and this integrates around the closed curve C(t) to 0. \nWe have implicitly assumed that C(t) cuts the shocks transversely. If there is a time t* for \nwhich C(t*) is somewhere tangential to a shock surface, then the number of shocks cutting C(t) \nwill generally change as t passes through t*. However, t* will typically be isolated, and (1) will \nhold on either side of t*. But the circulation itself is continuous at t*, so (1) still holds through t*, \nprovided that we allow the left- and right-derivatives to differ. \nHowever, if the flow contains vortex sheets (surfaces of tangential discontinuity), then a more \nfundamental problem arises. Consider, for instance, a shock wave undergoing Mach reflection \nat a rigid wall, so there is a line L where the three shocks and the vortex sheet meet. If this \nline L crosses a closed material curve in the incident gas flow, then the curve will no longer be \nclosed: after the first crossing it will form an open arc, whose two ends separate on either side of \nthe vortex sheet, and after the second crossing it will become two open arcs. In this situation, \n(1) will be valid for a material curve that remains on one side or other of the vortex sheet, but \notherwise will only be valid until L meets the curve. \nREFERENCES \n1. H.
