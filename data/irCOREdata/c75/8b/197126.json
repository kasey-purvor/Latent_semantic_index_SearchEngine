At the same time, feminist \nanalysis of contemporary migration remains bound to the analytical framework \ncentred on control, and approaches borders and immigration regulations primarily in \nterms of exclusion. Yet, the contemporary transformations of state borders, labour \nrelations and citizenship question the currency and adequacy of the exclusion-based \ninterpretative model. This article brings together feminist and queer migration studies \nwith literature on the transformation of borders, sovereignty and citizenship as \ndeveloped in critical political theory with the aim of broadening the interpretative \nscope and political relevance of feminist and queer migration scholarship. The stakes \nare both theoretical and political in that such a reading allows for a more nuanced \naccount of the changing forms of governing as well as of emerging political \nsubjectivity.  \n \n \nKeywords: gender, sexuality, migration, labour, citizenship \n \n \n 2 \n \nControl of migration and control of women\u2019s bodies have long gone hand in hand. In \nthe late 1800s, the Page Law which in the first instance targeted Asian women \nmigrating for sex work, restricted Chinese women entering the United States as it \neffectively conflated Chinese women\u2019s migration with enslaved prostitution. \nSimilarly, in the late 1970s, as part of the official governmental policy informed by \nthe stereotype that to enter a marriage a South Asian woman had to be a virgin, \nBritish immigration officers subjected prospective Indian brides to \u2018virginity tests\u2019. \nAssumptions and norms about sexuality and gender determine whom the state permits \nor denies entry and stay on its territory and impact on immigration regulations. \nFeminist scholarship has shown that throughout the 1980s, immigration regulations in \nseveral European countries upheld a gendered division of labour by assigning women \na \u2018dependent\u2019 status that kept many migrant women out of paid employment for a \nperiod of between six months and two years. This was done through family \nreunification schemes which assumed that the man was the economically motivated \nmigrant actor, the \u2018breadwinner\u2019, and the woman his dependent (Bosniak, 2007;  \nMorokvasic, 1984). Scholars of queer migration have taken this analysis further and \nillustrated how immigration schemes are based on normative assumptions around the \nnuclear family, marriage, and biological reproduction that privilege and enforce the \nnotion of a heterosexual family comprised of a husband, his wife, and their children \n(Manalansan, 2006).  \n \nNorms about morality and sexuality are deeply entrenched within immigration \nprocedures. In the US, for many years gays and lesbians could be refused admission if \nthey self-identified or were identified by others as being homosexuals (Luibh\u00e9id, \n 3 \n2002). This law was repealed in 1990 and sexual orientation alone was no longer a \nvalid basis for excluding a prospective immigrant, however female sexuality in \nparticular remains bound by socially \u2018acceptable\u2019 notions of femininity to such an \nextent that recent women\u2019s migration from eastern Europe provoked anxieties \nconcerning migrant women\u2019s uncontrolled sexuality. These anxieties are most clearly \nvisible in the numerous anti-trafficking campaigns across eastern Europe which \ndiscourage women from migrating by equating informal labour migration with forced \nprostitution and home as a safe haven. By portraying the \u2018home\u2019 as being a place \ndevoid of danger and thus also of prostitution, these campaigns equate women\u2019s place \nwith their sexuality and attempt to regulate the latter by placing women within the \nspace of heterosexual domesticity (Nieuwenhuys and P\u00e9coud, 2007: Sharma, 2003). \n \nStates\u2019 immigration policies need to be understood in relation to the sexual and \ngendered construction of the nation. Sexuality and gender play a constitutive role in \nthe formation and definition of the nation insofar as the reproduction of nationhood \nand citizenship remain premised on heterosexuality and heteromasculinity. These \ndenote certain bodies as desirable and others, in particular racialized or non-\nprocreative (i.e. homosexuals) as being a threat to nation\u2019s survival (Alexander, \n1994). States might not always be repressive of homosexuality but depending on \nspecific historical and political conjectures (such as post September 11 in the US), \ngays and lesbians might get incorporated in the nation as part of the patriotic \nideology. This ideology produces an \u2018us-versus-them\u2019 nationalist rhetoric which \nparticipates in the construction of migrants as a threat to national security, and can \nlead to racial profiling, detentions and deportations (Puar, 2006). In fact, states (as, for \nexample, in the case of Netherlands) might deploy their progressive stance on \n 4 \nhomosexuality to restrict entry to certain groups of migrants. In order to gain access to \nthe Netherlands, migrants were required to view images of two men kissing and to \nindicate whether they found these to be offensive or an expression of personal \nfreedom, and whether they were willing to live in a country that values the free \nexpression of gay people. The exam thus enforces the distinction between the \nmodernity and secularism of the Dutch state, defined in terms of gender equality and \nrights of sexual minorities, and migrants\u2019 countries of origin seen as being driven by \npatriarchal and homophobic social arrangements.1 Sexuality, in its intersection with \nrace is a key to understanding the complexity of new dynamics of exclusion and how \napparently \u2018liberal\u2019 solutions might have \u2018illiberal\u2019 consequences such as the \ntightening of admission requirements, restrictive residency and work regulations, and \nthe exclusion of migrants from social citizenship (Walsum et al., 2007). \n \nImmigration regulation discloses how patriarchal relationships still remain significant \nand how deeply gender and sexual norms are entrenched in the procedures that \nregulate admission, stay, and access to citizenship. Borders and immigration \nregulations do not work simply as a mechanism that regulates entry into a state\u2019s \nterritory but, significantly, they operate as a \u2018system of sexual regulation\u2019 (Luibh\u00e9id, \n2002: xxvi). The overwhelming emphasis in the feminist and queer literature on \nmigration control has led scholars to privilege the analytic framework centred on \nexclusion in which states enforce migrants\u2019 exclusion via refusal of entry at the \nborder, removal through deportation, or denial of citizenship. The gender and sexual \nbiases that are in-built within immigration regulations signal the undiminished \nrelevance of classical feminist issues such as patriarchy, wage labour, and equality \nand the continuing urgent need to rethink migration studies through the perspective of \n 5 \nsexuality and gender. At the same time, the contemporary transformations of state \nborders, labour relations and citizenship question the currency and adequacy of the \nexclusion-based interpretative model.  \n \nI will begin the second section of my article with a discussion of borders and \nimmigration laws as regimes of sexual and gender regulation and as mechanisms of \nexclusion, as these are commonly identified in classical feminist and queer migration \nscholarship. In section three I will consider the blurring of the boundary between \n\u2018inside\u2019 and \u2018outside\u2019 resulting from the changes in functioning of borders and \nimmigration regimes. I will show that borders, labour, and citizenship are undergoing \nprofound transformations to such an extent that scholars speak of delocalisation of \nborders, multiplication of labour, and disarticulation of citizenship. These terms \nindicate changes in state sovereignty, a rupture of the citizen-worker relation, and the \ntransformation of citizenship from the unified model that links citizenry to national \nterritory. In the last section of the paper and using the examples of sex work, asylum, \nand same-sex marriage in Europe, I abandon the interpretative framework based on \nthe exclusion in favour of a model of differential inclusion which brings to the fore \nthe stratification and proliferation of subject positions. My intention is not simply to \ncompensate the imbalance in feminist and queer migration scholarship in favour of \ninclusion (albeit differential) by focusing on the acquisition rather than deprivation of \nrights. Rather, my aim is to broaden the interpretative scope and political relevance of \nclassical feminist and queer migration scholarship by integrating into its analysis of \nmigration the studies on changes in sovereignty, labour, and citizenship as developed \nin critical political theory. The stakes of this interpretative move are both theoretical \nand political in that such a reading allows for a more nuanced account of changing \n 6 \nforms of governing and of emerging figurations of political subjectivity. The \nchallenge this paper launches is to rethink, from the vantage point of sexuality and \ngender, how these differently positioned subjects of migration transform the \nboundaries of citizenship and interrupt the logic of the political, both of which are still \nrooted in the dichotomous forms of belonging.  \n \n \nSites of exclusion \n \nFeminist and queer migration scholars have played a key role in developing an \nanalysis of migratory flows that challenges the mainstream view of labour migration \nas being male-driven. They have demonstrated women\u2019s past and present active role \nas primary migrants and revealed the normative impact of heterosexuality and nuclear \nfamily on immigration laws. Conceptualizations of migratory flows which postulate \nmen as \u2018primary\u2019 and women as \u2018secondary\u2019 migrants, universalizes a rather specific \nmodel, namely that of the guest-worker during the mass labour migration in Europe \nbetween the 1950s and mid 1970s. This model, developed by Bohning (1984), is \norganized around the idea of distinct stages where the migratory process is initiated \nby single young men, and followed by older married men who at a later stage are \njoined by their spouses and children in order to supplement household income. \nContrary to the idea that women\u2019s migration occurred primarily through family \nreunifications that followed the cessation of the guest-worker system in the mid \n1970s, women participated in post-war migration both as primary migrants and as \nlabourers. This simplistic conceptualization of migratory processes rests on the \nclassical dualism that identifies the male with activity, production and the public \n 7 \nsphere, and female subjectivity with passivity, reproduction, and the private sphere. \nSuch a binary hierarchical model heavily influenced migrant women\u2019s positions as \ndependents with derived rights and their exclusion from citizenship. For example, \nunder the guest-worker system, unlike men, family reunification policies did not \nallow migrant women to bring into the country of migration their spouses or \ndependents (Bhabha and Shutter, 1994). Were a white woman citizen to marry a \nforeign national she would automatically lose her nationality, as was the case for \nexample in the Netherlands until the early 1960s. In cases where the husband was \ndeported, the women and children would also be deported back to husband\u2019s country \nof citizenship (de Hart, 2007).  \n \nToday, while formal immigration laws have changed so that in the EU migrant men \nand women have equal rights to family reunification, gendered and racialized coding \nof the labour markers still impact differently on migrant women. Migrant women \noften work in sectors of the economy such as in a domestic and caring sector where \nthe temporality or informality of employment relations, the level of income, and the \ntype of living arrangements make it difficult to satisfy the requirements of family \nreunification. The right of women who are EU nationals to reside with a non-EU \nhusband and establish a family in the wife\u2019s country of citizenship is still questioned \nin a way that the right of male EU citizens is not. A review of European legal \ndecisions has shown that in cases when non-EU nationals are refused a residence \npermit or are under threat of deportation, national courts expect the wife to follow the \nhusband to his country of citizenship, even in cases when the wife is a (white) EU \ncitizen (de Hart, 2007). In short, women and men still stand in a different relationship \nto citizenship, usually to the disadvantage of women (Lister, 2004).  \n 8 \n \nYoung single women\u2019s migration is subject to immigration practices and regulations \nthat enforce norms around gender and sexuality. In particular, border has been \nidentified as a key site where control is played out. In the 1960s, the border officers \nmonitoring the US-Mexican border refused to admit lesbians, namely those who they \nidentified as being \u2018too\u2019 masculine in manner, dress and look (Luibh\u00e9id, 2002). The \ncontrol at the border is often enforced though violence. Young migrant women \nworking in export assembly plants or maquiladoras at the Mexican \u2013 US border have \nbeen affected by high levels of violence and abuse. Social movement called Ni Una \nMas (Not One More) brought to the public attention the deaths of hundreds of young \nwomen who migrated autonomously from rural Mexico to work in maquiladoras. \nThese deaths, initially dismissed by the local authorities as simply being those of \nprostitutes against whom the use violence of is implicitly justified, need to be seen in \nrelation to the economy of the export processing zones in the border region. Factories \nare run on the basis of flexible labour employment and give priority to hiring young \nwomen migrants who lack family support, are pressured against political organizing, \nand are excluded from traditional unions led by men who dismiss women on the basis \nthat they are temporary workers and bring down the level of wages. Women\u2019s \nvulnerability to abuse in the border regions thus needs to be examined in relation to: \nthe labour exploitation in the export oriented zones, women\u2019s labour participation \naway from the domestic sphere, and their increased role as independent migrants \n(Nash, 2006: Wright, 2006). Sexual violence is used systematically against migrant \nwomen crossing the border between Mexico and the US.  Agents of the US Border \nControl have been known to rape, detain, and then release migrant women caught \ncrossing the Mexican \u2013 US border illegally. While not directly expelling a woman \n 9 \nmigrant from a country, sexual abuse nevertheless constitutes an act of exclusion as it \noperates as a technology that reproduces gender and sexual hierarchies and norms on \nthe one hand and racial and class divisions on the other. Rape effectively inscribes the \nborder on migrant women\u2019s bodies. This border is at the same time an external border \nthat sanctions and maintains the difference between \u2018us\u2019 and \u2018them\u2019, \u2018citizens\u2019 and \n\u2018aliens\u2019, and is also an internal border that confines undocumented migrant women to \nthe low-end service sector of the US economy. Rape thus plays a crucial role in \nreconstructing national borders and in upholding the exclusionary social order \n(Luibh\u00e9id, 2002, p. 130).  \n \nFamily control and the patriarchal arrangements of women\u2019s migration, when taking \nplace outside of the state sanctioned schemes, prompt repressive legal responses.2 A \ntimely example is women\u2019s sex work migration in Europe. Since the 1990s, a growing \nnumber of women from eastern Europe\u2019s new and non-EU member states have \nmigrated to the EU for work in the domestic and entertainment sector, agriculture, and \nthe sex industry. Sex work migration in particular is often identified with forced \nmigration and classified under the heading of \u2018trafficking\u2019. The trafficking rhetoric \nhowever conceals women\u2019s autonomous migration and their migratory projects \nbehind the term \u2018victims\u2019. Organized around the victims-criminals discursive binary, \ntrafficking rhetoric depicts Mafia-like organizations as enslaving women in \nprostitution by means of force or debt-bondage. It also engenders and relies on the \ndualism between forced and voluntary prostitution, identifying migrant women as \nvictims of trafficking. By doing so, trafficking equates forced prostitution with \nmigrant prostitution and consequently it \u2018racialises\u2019 the categories of free vs. \nvoluntary prostitution. It also simplifies the identification of \u2018Western\u2019 sex workers as \n 10 \nbeing capable of self-determination and of migrant women as being duped and \npassive victims. Accordingly, policy measures are devised to assist \u2018victims\u2019 of \ntrafficking but not those sex workers who find themselves in exploitative working \nconditions. Several EU states have put in place long or short-term victim protection \nschemes. These are commonly embedded in the normative concept of victimhood \ncomprised of forced migration, coercion into prostitution, and economic exploitation. \nFor example, in Italy women are required to leave prostitution and participate in a \nprogram of social re-integration. Consequently, those women who fall out of the \ncategory of the \u2018proper\u2019 victim are denied legal protection and become vulnerable to \ndeportation (Andrijasevic, 2007: Crowhurst, 2007). Gender-normative aspect of \nexisting trafficking provisions and the absence of protection schemes for sex workers \nhas prompted scholars to argue that sex trafficking policies produce geographies of \nexclusion by means of which states regulate sexual moralities and define acceptable \nand unacceptable subject positions (Hubbard et al., 2008: Sayeed, 2006).  \n \nContrary to the image of \u2018western\u2019 states as being liberal and progressive with respect \nto women\u2019s sexuality, access to labour, and citizenship, family reunification policies \nand labour recruitment schemes suggest that immigration laws enforce migrants\u2019 \ndependency and vulnerability on heteropatriarchal relations and regulatory structures \n(Reddy, 2005). Through their immigration policies, states impose conditions of \nmarriage and social reproduction, consequently constructing certain subjectivities as \ndeviant and restricting their entry to the state territory (Manalansan, 2006, p. 321). \nBorder controls and immigration regulations hence need to be examined for the role \nthey play in upholding heterosexuality as a norm and in actively constructing \nboundaries around what does and does not constitute homosexuality. Deviation from \n 11 \ngender and sexual norms most commonly results in exclusion from entering the state \nborders and from staying in a state\u2019s territory (i.e. deportation) and from accessing \ncitizenship (i.e. illegality). In this respect, immigration laws and borders are key sites \nfor the control of sexual and gender norms in as much as they establish the \nsubjectivities that endanger the nation and that promote citizenship (Alexander, 1994). \n \n \nTransformations  \n \nIn this section I discuss the limitations of feminist and queer migration scholarship \ngiven its analytic reliance on the paradigm of exclusion. This paradigm works from \nwhat we can call \u2018classical\u2019 premises about borders, labour, and sovereignty. Yet, in \ncontemporary times these have all undergone major transformations engendered by \nmigratory movements. The \u2018classical\u2019 take on migration conceptualizes borders in \nterms of external edges of the state, labour in terms of gendered division between \nproductive and reproductive work, and sovereignty in terms of state sovereignty. Such \nan understanding is increasingly becoming politically and theoretically inadequate as \nit sanctions the distinction between inside and outside and establishes a strict \nconnection between state and its territory. \n \nFor a considerable amount of time, borders have featured prominently in the news and \npoliticians\u2019 discourses on migration. A particular emphasis has been placed on \n\u2018illegal\u2019 border crossing and the threat that it poses to a state\u2019s security and the \nfunctioning of its immigration and labour regulations. The role of the border in \ncountering irregular migration is constantly reaffirmed through what Nicholas de \n 12 \nGenova called the \u2018spectacle of militarised border enforcement\u2019 (De Genova, 2002). \nEurope\u2019s southern and eastern borders, the US\u2019 southern border with Mexico, and \nAustralia\u2019s northern waters have all featured as sites of heavy border policing and the \nresultant apprehension of irregular migrants. Despite the fact that research provided \nample evidence that the majority of irregular migrants do not enter via irregular \nborder crossings but rather become irregular once their visa expires or they overstay \ntheir residence permits, the effects of the representation of militarized border \nenforcement should not be dismissed too easily. It should be kept in mind that such \nrepresentations fix the location of a state\u2019s external borders, suture immigration \npolicing to the territorial margins of a state, and posit the state as being solely in \ncharge of its borders. Moreover they oversimplify migratory movements by reducing \nthem to the space of the border, thereby representing migrants as being located at the \n\u2018outside\u2019 and pushing against state\u2019s external borders.  \n \nSuch representations of the borders are misleading as they obscure the \ntransformations that are reshaping borders. The \u2018classical\u2019 conception of a \ngeopolitical border that determined the definition and the organization of the modern \nstate in Europe, rests on the distinction between \u2018inside\u2019 and \u2018outside\u2019 and on the strict \nconnection between the state and the territory. Recently, the processes of \nglobalization (especially the case of EU enlargement) have brought about significant \nchanges to the spatiality and the rationale of the border (Walters, 2002). While the \nearly literature on globalization and borders hypothesized the erosion of borders, \nrecent studies point out the ways in which borders have been diffused, dispersed and \nnetworked under conditions of globalization. Borders are thought of less as being \ncontinuous linear structures enclosing a political territory and demarcating a state\u2019s \n 13 \nexternal edges, and more as being zones, bands, nodes, and filters. Indeed scholars \nnow talk of a \u2018virtual border\u2019 (Freudenstein, 2001), and \u2018indeterminate\u2019 (Bigo, 2003) \nand \u2018technological\u2019 zones (Barry, 2006). These changes are referred to in terms of the \n\u2018proliferation\u2019 of borders and \u2018delocalization of control\u2019 (Rigo, 2005) in order to \nindicate that the control, once located at the borders, is now exercised by a variety of \nmeans and in a variety of locations. Readmission agreements, the system of visa \nregulation, carrier sanctions, offshore outsourcing of detention facilities, and \ncooperation with third countries in deportation procedures are (amongst others) all \ninstances of such delocalization. Despite the image of \u2018Fortress Europe\u2019, borders are \nnot impenetrable nor do they match a fixed geographical demarcation. Rather, they \nare discontinuous and porous spaces that simultaneously extend beyond and within \nthe \u2018traditional\u2019 site of the border. These alert us to the ways in which proliferation of \nborders and processes of re-bordering blur the boundary between externality and \ninternality (Mezzadra and Neilson, 2008) and transform the borders into zones of \ninnovation in the technologies of government (Rumford, 2006).  \n \nThe proliferation of borders has brought changes to the notion of territorial \nsovereignty. This notion, understood in classical legal theory as resting on the \ninseparability between sovereignty and the law, has been ruptured though the process \nof delocalization. This rupture produces a \u2018discontinuity\u2019 in the juridical space and \nresults in what scholars refer to as \u2018shared sovereignty\u2019 (Rigo, 2007) or \u2018overlapping \nsovereignty\u2019 (Ong, 2006) to indicate the engendering of differently administrated \nspaces and how state sovereignty is shared among state and non-state actors. Today\u2019s \nborders are less about \u2018control\u2019 and more about \u2018management\u2019 combining \nheterogeneous domains of personnel, goods, people, data, audit capability, \n 14 \ninternational cooperation, and partnerships with carriers and industry (Andrijasevic \nand Walters, 2009). This is not to claim that territory does not play a role in the \nfunctioning of the border or that the state has no decision making power over entry or \nexit from its territory, but rather that state sovereignty is being transformed via the \ngrowing involvement of non-state actors and of public-private contractual networks in \nthe government of migration. \n \nThe transformation of borders is profoundly changing the labour relations and \nlabouring subjects and vice versa. Citizenship is bound to the national labour market \nin that full-time paid employment still usually constitutes the major prerequisite for \nsocial citizenship. The transformations in the gendered division of labour, typical of \nwhat used to be the Fordist mode of production are, however, deeply affecting this \nmodel. The result is that the nexus between citizenship and labour no longer maps \nneatly onto the citizen-worker dyad. Scholars use the terms \u2018precarity\u2019 and \n\u2018precarious\u2019 with reference to labour to explicate the transformation of productive \nlabour brought about by the crisis of the capital to create value out of \nproduction\/reproduction labour separation (Marazzi, 2007: Papadopoulos et al., \n2008). This process means that work has increasingly become subjective, affective, \nrelational, and communicative (Berlant, 2007). The terms \u2018feminization of work\u2019 and \n\u2018becoming a woman of production\u2019 (Precarias a la Deriva, 2004) suggest that this \nmodel of labour incorporates as now being central the type of work previously \nundervalued and delegated to women under the heading of \u2018reproductive labour\u2019. \nConsequently, the distinction between work and not-work, and between public and \nprivate has changed too. This does not imply that the dualism of \nproduction\/reproduction no longer exists, but rather that reading it exclusively in \n 15 \nterms of gendered division of labour does not fully capture the contemporary forms of \nlabour arrangements.  \n \nThe breaking down of the citizen \u2013 worker dyad is occurring due to the changes in the \nlabour market and the transformation of the production process, and migration affects \nboth of these. On the one hand, it creates different types of citizens and, on the other \nhand, new worker subjectivities are needed to feed the production process. These two \nare separate, but constantly reinforce each other and investigating labour and \ncitizenship from the perspective of the border illustrates some of these \ntransformations. Against the assumption that border controls exclude migrants from \nentering a state and finding work, borders are best viewed as mechanisms that \nproduce \u2018deportability\u2019 (De Genova, 2002), thus creating  the conditions for migrants\u2019 \ninclusion as \u2018illegal\u2019 labour. This goes against the state\u2019s assumptions that illegality is \nsomething outside the immigration system, and that it can be dealt with through \nimmigration controls and by regulated labour recruitment schemes. Economic \nmigrants are required to access the labour market through labour immigration \nschemes that \u2018sort\u2019 different types of labour and sanction legal venues for migration. \nThis becomes explicit in the workings of the point-based immigration systems and the \nnotion of skills that I discuss in the following section. However, legality of entry, \nresidence, and employment do not overlap neatly and legality in one category does \nnot necessarily entail legality in the other (Anderson, 2007). Moreover, a documented \nentry into a country via official channels does not guarantee the stability and \npermanence of a legal status as one can fall \u2018in\u2019 and \u2018out\u2019 of legality. Contrary to the \nidea that legal entry and residency is a first step in the integration process that \neventually results in citizenship, the temporality of legal statuses suggests that \n 16 \nimmigration regulations do not operate as mechanisms of straightforward inclusion or \nexclusion, but rather produce differentiation and stratification of legal statuses and \nsubjectivities. Gender and sexuality, as I show in the next section, are crucial in order \nto understand this dynamic. Migration is lived or experienced differently by different \nsubjects and cannot just be considered in the abstract. Gender and sexuality are \ninherent in all aspects of a migratory project and need to be taken into consideration \nwhen investigating contemporary migrant subjectivity. This entails paying attention to \nhow gender and sexuality are taken up by the regulatory regimes but also, and perhaps \nmore importantly, how gender and sexuality inform migrant women\u2019s and men\u2019s \ninvestments in the migratory project in terms of femininity and masculinity (also \nacross genders), and how they determine the way in which they negotiate various \ncontradictions produced by the discursive regimes and juridical norms which regulate \ntheir lives (Mai, forthcoming ).  \n \nNow that borders, labour and sovereignty no longer map neatly onto the space of the \nnation-state, we need to think beyond the state-centric model of sovereignty and to \ncapture the ways in which the state\u2019s territorial and institutional organization have \nchanged and how these affect labour relations and labouring subjects. Transnational \nsovereignty does not operate along the inclusion\/exclusion model as it regulates flows \nnot populations. It attempts to decrease the flow of migrants and regulate its intensity \nfollowing the crisis and the emerging reconfiguration of the labour markets. While \npopulations can be included or excluded or differentially included in the nation state, \nmigration flows are \u2018organically\u2019 related to the inner workings of labour markets and \ncore elements of the production process. In other words, transnational sovereignty \n 17 \nworks together with a transnational reorganisation of labour that can only in part be \nregulated by the nation state. \n \n \nSites of production  \n \nIn this section I bring together feminist and queer approaches to migration with the \nanalysis of transformations I discussed in the previous section, in order to broaden the \nframework within which to read contemporary women\u2019s migration. Using the \nexamples of sex work and asylum, I will first read them from the perspective of \nexclusion and then re-interpret them from the vantage point of the changing workings \nof borders. This shift in perspective opens up new interpretative possibilities in \ntheorizing subjectivities and brings to the fore sexuality and gender as key sites where \nconflicts around the changing nature of labour, control, and citizenship are \nmaterializing. \n \nGiven the predominance of concerns surrounding sex trafficking, women\u2019s migration \nfor sex work has commonly been addressed in relation to trafficking. Studies \ninvestigating sex trafficking from the perspective of migration challenged the \nassumed correlation between sex trafficking and organized crime. The studies have \nalso shown that such an understanding of trafficking fails to address the convergence \nbetween anti-trafficking and anti-immigration policies. Moreover, the international \ninstruments set in place to counter trafficking (such as the Palermo Protocol) have \nbeen criticized for actually facilitating the cooperation between states to prevent \nirregular migration, rather than protecting or giving restitution to the victims of crime \n 18 \nor migrants in situations of labour exploitation (Chapkis, 2003: Gallagher, 2001). \nBuilding on this critique of immigration control and its challenge to the category of \nthe \u2018victim\u2019, I develop a more nuanced reading of the anti-immigration\/sex trafficking \nnexus in order to broaden the understanding of anti-trafficking policies beyond merely \nbeing tools for the straightforward exclusion of migrants or for their inclusion under \nthe respective headings of \u2018agents\u2019 or \u2018victims\u2019.  \n \n\u2018Sex trafficking\u2019 \nIn order to do this I discuss an example of a woman from Moldova, drawn from my \nown fieldwork (conducted in 2000-2001) with women from non-EU member states \nwho were migrating to Italy via \u2018trafficking\u2019 channels for work in the sex sector. The \nMoldovan woman decided to migrate to Italy and used the services of an agency to \norganize her travel. She left Moldova travelling with a group of ten other women, and \nhaving traversed Romania and Hungary by train she was intercepted by the border \npolice while crossing the Austrian border on foot. Identified as a \u2018victim of \ntrafficking\u2019 (i.e. of coerced migration geared towards labour exploitation), she was \n\u2018rescued\u2019 and returned home. In reality this means that she was first shortly detained \nat the Austrian border and then moved to another prison in Hungary, and was released \nwhen she had gathered enough money to self-fund her travel back to Romania (this \nmoney was given to her by a migrant from Pakistan who was detained for irregular \nborder crossing). From there, she eventually returned to Moldova and started \nsearching for a different way to get to Italy again paying an agency. Some months \nlater she set off again, this time taking a different route (and again travelling with a \ngroup), she crossed Romania, Serbia, Albania, and finally reaches Italy by boat \nseveral months later. \n 19 \n \nAs can be seen, the interception at the border and detention did not prevent her from \ngetting to Italy. Rather, this caused her to change direction and prolonged the duration \nof her migration. Because each border crossing incurred costs (that she paid off \nthrough sex work), this exposed her to heighten levels of vulnerability, increased the \ncosts of her travel, and permitted the third parties organising her travel to gain more \ncontrol over the terms of her travel and labour (Andrijasevic, 2003). Border control, \ndenial of entry, detention, and deportation do not function exclusively as mechanisms \nof exclusion as they do not necessarily prevent or stop migratory movements. Rather, \nthey decelerate the speed of migratory flows by momentarily diverting their \ndirectionality and regulating the time of migration (Papadopoulos et al., 2008). Time \nincreasingly occupies a key role in regulating of migration, and access to citizenship. \nThis is best visible in the case of the EU enlargement process and the timing of \naccession (Avery, 2009). Becoming EU members does not entitle the nationals of the \n\u2018new\u2019 EU member states to the same labour rights that are enjoyed by the citizens \nfrom \u2018core\u2019 EU states. The freedom of nationals of the \u2018new\u2019 member states (EU-8) to \ntake up employment anywhere in the EU has been delayed for a period of between \ntwo and seven years after accession. This type of selective citizenship temporarily \npostpones the full labour participation  of \u2018new\u2019 EU citizens in the EU and enables a \nflexible regime of differential inclusion among the \u2018core\u2019 EU states, the \u2018new\u2019 \nmembers, and the non-member states (Rigo, 2007). In this changing political \nlandscape, trafficking policies normalize the hierarchically organized access to EU \nlabour market and citizenship. The category of the trafficking victim mobilizes a \nsimilar temporality. Constructed as \u2018white\u2019 through their recurring representation as \nblond and blue-eyed and through discursive positioning as innocent victims, eastern \n 20 \nEuropean women are racially indistinguishable from \u2018European\u2019 women. It is \nprecisely their status as victims that differentiate them from their European \ncounterparts and positions them as being not yet \u2018fully\u2019 European. The category of the \ntrafficking victim conceals the conflicts arising from migrant women\u2019s mobility and \nthe EU\u2019s attempt to regulate migrants\u2019 circulation as a way of governing spaces no \nlonger enclosed by its external border. Women\u2019s bodies and migrant women\u2019s \nsexuality in particular are sites of struggle over redefinition of citizenship that \naccompanies the formation of the enlarged European space (Andrijasevic, 2007).     \n \nAsylum \nIn her essay on sexual regimes and migration control, Eithne Luibh\u00e9id discusses the \ncase of a Nigerian woman in Ireland whose request for asylum on the basis of gender \npersecution was rejected and who was subsequently served with a deportation order \n(2006). The applicant appealed against the decision on the grounds that she had \nbecome pregnant, but she lost the appeal because the judge decided that she had \nprovided false information, had manipulated the asylum system to secure residency, \nand was not a \u2018genuine\u2019 but was rather a \u2018bogus\u2019 refugee (namely an economic \nmigrant). Luibh\u00e9id rightly remarks that a women\u2019s reproductive sexuality has here \nbeen turned by the state into a tool for immigration control and has also been \nconstituted as a site on which the state re-draws the boundary between citizens and \nnon-citizens (Luibh\u00e9id, 2006, p. 74). Given that this case occurred at the time of the \npanic about \u2018citizenship touring\u2019 - namely migrant women travelling to Ireland to give \nbirth - and was followed by a referendum that put an end to birthright citizenship, the \nauthor argues that fears over migrant women\u2019s sexuality enabled the tightening of \nrestrictive immigration laws (Luibh\u00e9id, 2006, p. 75).  \n 21 \n \nThe category distinctions between \u2018bogus\u2019 and \u2018genuine\u2019 refugees resembles the \ncategories of \u2018marriage of convenience\u2019 and \u2018genuine love\u2019 discussed in relation to \nhomosexual unions. In recent years, several European states have adopted legislations \nthat recognize same-sex marriages and registered partnerships that have made \npossible the family reunification between EU and non-EU nationals. However, it is \ncommon practice for immigration officials to \u2018assess\u2019 love between partners in order \nto prevent so-called \u2018marriages of convenience\u2019, whose primary aim is that of entry or \nresidence. In the UK, for example, in the case of cohabiting couples the policy \nremains bound to the \u2018akin to marriage\u2019 model where partners must present evidence \nof cohabitation (Simmons, 2004). Hence, even in the countries that adopted \nlegislation that recognizes same-sex marriage and partnership, sexual citizenship \nremains grounded in the normative model of the marriage and framed as a \u2018genuine\u2019 \nlove match between two people.     \n \nThe emphasis put on women\u2019s rights to asylum by broadening the category of the \nrefugee to include gender specific persecution, and the right of homosexuals to enter a \nmarriage by expanding the category so it includes both heterosexual and homosexual \narrangements, are both based on the logic of gender and\/or sexual identity. Yet, if we \nmove away from the politics of rights and identity, it is possible to observe the market \nand economic imperative that is becoming increasingly prominent in immigration and \ncitizenship policies. The categories of \u2018bogus\u2019 and \u2018genuine\u2019 make explicit the link \nthe state makes between immigration status and labour, as well as the attempt the state \nmakes to assert its authority on matters of labour migration by categorising migrants \nas \u2018legal\u2019 and \u2018illegal\u2019 entrants. By accepting this simplistic dualism, we fail to \n 22 \nobserve that the boundaries between illegality and legality are blurred and that \nillegality has become a structural characteristic of today\u2019s migratory movements. \nInterestingly, migrants are increasingly choosing to remain irregular rather than \napplying for asylum (ECRE, 2007). This binary framework also hinders our \nunderstanding of the degree to which immigration policies have been diversified in \norder to adjust migratory flows to the imaginary or real market demand for migrant \nlabour. This is most clearly visible in the points-based immigration systems that are \norganized around the notion of skills. These require migrants to have certain \nexperiences, be of a certain age, country of origin, and in certain instances be \nchildless or of a specific marital status in order to qualify for a specific category. The \npriority given to skills, while these remain socially constructed and highly gendered, \nis producing a diversification of migrants\u2019 legal statuses and a stratification of \nsubjectivities. In the case of same sex marriages, this means that those lesbians and \ngays possessing skills identified as being in demand might gain entry as work permit \nholders and thus circumvent the restrictive family reunification policies.  \n \nI wish to emphasise that I do not mean to offer an uncritical praise of the neo-liberal \nreforms that introduce market arrangements into social and political life. Rather, I am \narguing that it is important to highlight how migration changes sovereignty in that it \nchallenges what Barry Hindess has called \u2018an internalist\u2019 view of citizenship. Such a \nposition identifies citizenship as being \u2018a matter between an individual and the state to \nwhich that individual belongs\u2019 (Hindess, 2002, p. 136). Migration exposes the \nincreasing impact of the market on citizenship and points to the necessity of \nunderstanding citizenship not as being an exclusive matter of state sovereignty, but \nrather as being a part of supra-national governmental regimes. Sexuality and gender, \n 23 \nin particular, draw attention to the conflicts arising from the transformation of \ncitizenship as is taking place through changes in labour arrangements and state \nsovereignty.     \n \n \nConclusions  \n \nTo date there has been very little crossover between feminist and queer migration \nstudies and the literature on transformation of borders, sovereignty, and citizenship. In \nthis article I have tried to bring these two fields of research together in order to \nbroaden the theoretical scope and political relevance of feminist and queer migration \nscholarship which remains bound to the analytical framework centered on control, and \napproaches borders and immigration regulations primarily in terms of exclusion. The \npremises on which the exclusion interpretative model is based and which I have called \nthe classical premises about borders, labour, and sovereignty, have all undergone \nmajor transformations conveyed by terms such as delocalization of borders, \nmultiplication of labour, and shared sovereignty. These indicate the rupture of the \nconnection between the state and its territory, and of the citizen-worker dyad on \nwhich are based the logic of the inside and outside, the gendered division of labour \nand the integrative model of citizenship. \n \nThe emergence of these complex 'assemblages' (Sassen, 2006) and the increase in the \ndisjuncture between the state and citizenship are resulting in proliferation of subject \npositions that no longer fit the inclusion\/exclusion dichotomy. If important features of \ncitizenship have changed, then there is a need to consider that its subjective dimension \n 24 \nhas also changed. As I have shown through the examples of sex trafficking, asylum \nand same sex marriage, the relevance of emerging migrant subjectivities lies in their \nimportance in re-drawing the borders of the political. 'Irregular' migrants whom \nSassen calls 'unauthorized yet recognized' are contesting and redefining the borders of \ncitizenship through claims to mobility, residency, and employment (Sassen, 2006, p.  \n296). In advancing these claims they cannot be identified as 'other' to citizens, but \nrather should be seen as political subjects engaging in 'acts of citizenship' (Isin, 2008).     \n \nFinally, I have suggested that the stratification of subjectivity via complex regulatory \nregimes points to the need to broaden the analysis beyond the oppression\/resistance \nframework on agency, and to pay greater attention to the multiple and potentially \ncontradictory positions that migrant subjects occupy. What this means in terms of \nfuture research is problematizing a reading of agency in terms of antagonism to \nnormative structures and attempting to answer what makes individuals identify and\/or \nresist certain subject positions and construct a sense of self through them. The role of \ninvestments and imagination are crucial here. If scholars are to make sense of multiple \npositions that migrant subjects take up, we need to theorize the role fantasy, desire \nand unconscious investments play in the process of subjectivation (Moore, 2007). An \nanalytical framework organized from the vantage point of gender and sexuality is best \nplaced to offer a nuanced reading of emerging migrant subjectivities and of the \npolitical transformations these are bringing about. \n \n \nEndnotes: \n \n 25 \n1 The exam exempted citizens of the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, \nJapan and Switzerland. http:\/\/www.msnbc.msn.com\/id\/11842116\/  \n \n2 Interestingly, when enforced and regulated by the state, some situations and \nsolutions commonly viewed as being deviant are permitted and even encouraged. At \nthe peak time of nation state building in the colonies, recruitment of prostitutes was \ncrucial in maintaining the (hetero)sexual and racial social order, and in disciplining \nmale sexuality and increasing  productivity. For example, in the mid 19th century \nadministrators of one of the British Empire\u2019s leading penal settlements on the \nAndaman Islands in the Bay of Bengal recruited female sex workers with similar \nracial\/ethnic backgrounds to the male prisoners (Hindu, Sikh, and Muslim) and \nintroduced family immigration schemes in order to counter sex between men, to \nencourage heterosexual marriages, and maintain a high level of palm oil production \n(Weston, 2008). Similarly, during the same period, the Indian government introduced \na female quota on ships carrying indentured labourers in the conviction that a greater \nfemale presence would stabilize the gender relations and increase the economic \nproductivity of indentured male workers (Levine, 2007, p. 148). \n \n \nAcknowledgments \n \nThe writing of this paper was enabled by the British Academy\/Association of \nCommonwealth Universities Grant for International Collaboration and also by the \nVisiting Fellowship scheme at the Centre for Cultural Research of the University of \nWestern Sydney.
