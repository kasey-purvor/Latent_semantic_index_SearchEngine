According to Vygotsky (1934\/1987), a \nrevolution in development is triggered when preverbal thought and preintellectual \nlanguage come together to create fundamentally new forms of mental functioning. \nRather than representing a developmental dead-end (Piaget, 1923\/1926), the \nphenomenon of private speech (Flavell, 1966) \u2013 speech that is not obviously \naddressed to another listener \u2013 provides psychologists with a useful window onto this \nrevolution in development. In Vygotsky\u2019s view, private speech represents a stage in \nthe gradual internalisation of interpersonal linguistic exchanges whose final \nontogenetic destination is inner speech, or verbal thought.  \n Research into the phenomenon of private speech has provided arguably the \nbest opportunity for a thorough empirical test of Vygotsky\u2019s ideas on the relations \nbetween thought and language (Berk, 1992). Since the appearance of the first English \ntranslation of Vygotsky\u2019s work (Vygotsky, 1934\/1962), psychologists have addressed \nseveral questions about the form and function of children\u2019s private speech. For \nexample, in tracing the development of private speech over the preschool and early \nschool years, researchers have found general support for Vygotsky\u2019s predictions \nabout age-related changes in the incidence and structure of this form of speech. \nPrivate speech has been found to follow a predictable trajectory from overt task-\nirrelevant speech, to overt task-relevant speech such as self-guiding comments, and \nultimately to external manifestations of inner speech such as whispering and inaudible \nmuttering (e.g. Berk, 1986; Berk & Garvin, 1984; Bivens & Berk, 1990; Kohlberg, \nPrivate Speech  4 \nYaeger, & Hjertholm, 1968; Patrick & Abravanel, 2000; Winsler, Diaz, & Montero, \n1997). There has, however, been only limited support for Vygotsky\u2019s claim that \nprivate speech \u2018goes underground\u2019 in the preschool and elementary school years, with \nsome studies reporting high levels of private speech well into the elementary school \nyears (Berk & Garvin, 1984; Berk & Potts, 1991) and into adulthood (Duncan & \nCheyne, 2002). \n The aim of the present study is to address two questions that can be derived \nfrom Vygotsky\u2019s views on private speech, but which have to date provided equivocal \nfindings: the relations between private speech and task difficulty, and between private \nspeech and task performance. We sought to address these issues by studying the \nprivate speech produced by young schoolchildren on a task with high executive \ndemand characteristics, the Tower of London (ToL).   \nPrivate speech and task difficulty \nIn Vygotsky\u2019s theory, the adaptive function of private speech as a tool for self-\nregulation is demonstrated by the finding that, as a task becomes more difficult, \nchildren become more likely to use overt self-directed speech as an accompaniment to \nbehaviour. Vygotsky\u2019s original (1934\/1987) prediction that private speech will \nincrease linearly with task difficulty has been supported both in studies of children \n(Beaudichon, 1973; Duncan & Pratt, 1997; Kohlberg et al., 1968) and young adults \n(Duncan & Cheyne, 2002).  \nThe assumption of a linear relation between private speech and task difficulty \nhas not gone unchallenged, however. In particular, it has been suggested that \nVygotsky\u2019s ideas are more suggestive of a quadratic relation between these variables, \nwith private speech being most likely to occur when the task is pitched within the \nability range, or \u2018zone of proximal development\u2019 (Vygotsky, 1934\/1987), of the \nPrivate Speech  5 \nparticipant (Behrend, Rosengren, & Perlmutter, 1989). When the task is too simple, \nself-regulatory speech will be unnecessary, because the required regulatory processes \nwill already have been internalised. When the task is too difficult, private speech will \nbe ineffective, resulting either in failure on the task or resort to other means of \nregulation.  \nTo test this idea, Behrend et al. (1989) observed children aged between 2 and \n5 engaged in solving puzzles either alone or with a parent, finding that the incidence \nof private speech peaked when the task was appropriate to, or slightly in advance of, \nthe child\u2019s current level of ability. However, the non-continuous measure of difficulty \nused in this study, particularly the fact that the puzzles were qualitatively different \nfrom each other and were therefore not equated for perceptual complexity, meant that \nthis quadratic relation could not be tested for statistical significance. In addition, \nBehrend et al.\u2019s coding scheme for private speech, which simply distinguished \nbetween social and private speech without analysing the latter into its functional sub-\ntypes, meant that these researchers were unable to investigate how task difficulty \nrelated to the content and function of private utterances.  \nPrivate speech and task performance \nOur second main focus of interest concerns the relation between private speech and \ntask performance. The rationale behind the Vygotskian approach to this question is \nthat, if private speech has a positive role to play in self-regulation, its use should be \nassociated with superior task performance. Initial investigations of this issue led to \nequivocal results, with some researchers reporting positive associations between \nprivate speech and task performance (e.g. Beaudichon, 1973; Goodman, 1981; \nWinsler, Diaz, McCarthy, Atencio, & Chabay, 1999), and others reporting little or no \nassociation (e.g. Berk, 1986; Frauenglass & Diaz, 1985; see Berk, 1992, for a review). \nPrivate Speech  6 \nIn their attempt to resolve this condundrum, Frauenglass and Diaz (1985) presented \nevidence that private speech is frequently more closely associated with concurrent \ntask failure than with task success. The implication of this is that private speech, as a \nstrategy which facilitates children\u2019s growing mastery over a task, will be more \nstrongly correlated with future success than with concurrent success.  \nSupport for this idea has come from reports that the incidence of private \nspeech predicts subsequent rather than concurrent performance (Azmitia, 1992; \nBehrend, Rosengren, & Perlmutter, 1992; Bivens & Berk, 1990; Gaskill & Diaz, \n1991). Winsler et al. (1997) showed that task-relevant speech predicted immediate \npost-test improvements on a selective attention task, in those instances where children \nwere able to benefit from adult scaffolding. These authors noted that the speech\u2013\nperformance relation will be sensitive to the level of task difficulty at which the child \nis being required to operate. Thus, when a task is difficult, private speech is likely to \nbe associated with task failure. When the task is brought within the child\u2019s ability \nrange, in contrast, the speech\u2013performance correlation is likely to be positive. Winsler \net al.\u2019s (1997) study was not directly able to test this hypothesis, however, as their \ndesign did not allow for a continuous measure of task difficulty. In addition, their \nperformance measure was dichotomous (pass\/fail) rather than continuous, necessarily \nreducing the power of their statistical analyses. Finally, they did not make the typical \ndistinction between social and private speech, focusing exclusively on utterances \nmade when children were working alone on the task, and automatically categorising \nsuch utterances as private.  \nA full answer to the question of the relation between private speech and task \nperformance will therefore require a study design that can deliver both global and \nitem-by-item speech\u2013performance correlations, allowing the relation to be examined \nPrivate Speech  7 \nat varying levels of task difficulty. Filling this gap in the private speech literature was \nthe second main aim of the study presented here.  \nMethodological issues \nThe present study set out to investigate Vygotskian hypotheses about private speech, \ntask difficulty and task performance in the context of a task that allowed for \ncontinuous task difficulty and task performance measures. In planning the study, we \nwere able to draw on a number of suggestions for methodological improvements \nmade by private speech researchers (e.g. Diaz, 1992). Firstly, in light of evidence that \nnon-communicative speech-to-self is stimulated by the presence of others (e.g. \nGoudena, 1987; Kohlberg et al., 1968), we ensured that a quasi-social context was \npreserved by having an experimenter in reasonably close proximity to the child during \nthe problem-solving trials. Secondly, we made sure that our coding of private speech \nwas sufficiently flexible to allow both global and item-by-item correlations of task \nperformance, task difficulty, and incidence of the different sub-types of private \nspeech. Thirdly, we asked class teachers to give ratings of individual children\u2019s \ntalkativeness, thus providing us with independent corroboration of our laboratory \nmeasures of private and social speech. Fourthly, in line with other recent private \nspeech studies (e.g., Winsler, Diaz, Atencio, McCarthy & Adams Chabay, 2000), we \ntook measures of receptive verbal ability in order to control for the possibility that the \nfunctional significance of self-regulatory private speech might relate to the general \ncognitive and specific linguistic competences of the child.  \nFinally, our choice of task was intended to address a number of \nmethodological issues relating to task difficulty, task performance and inter-\nindividual variability in the incidence of private speech (Berk, 1992; Fuson, 1979). It \nis widely accepted that private speech is best studied when children are engaged in \nPrivate Speech  8 \ncognitively demanding tasks, such as the semantic task employed by Frauenglass and \nDiaz (1985), rather than lower-level cognitive tasks such as those requiring perceptual \nmatching. Instead of using a task requiring semantic processing, we chose a task with \na predominant executive component, the Tower of London (ToL) (Shallice, 1982). \nThis task had previously been found to elicit high levels of private speech \n(Fernyhough, 1994), and to have good test\u2013retest reliability (Bull, Espy, & Senn, \n2004). As well as having been studied widely in other contexts (e.g. Langdon & \nColtheart, 1999; Ozonoff & McEvoy, 1994; Pantelis et al., 1997), the ToL has the \nadvantage over semantic tasks that task difficulty can be varied systematically, with, \ncrucially, no variation in perceptual complexity. Furthermore, the task allows \nperformance measures to be obtained at each level of difficulty, as well as globally, \nresulting in a rich body of performance data.  \n Our hypotheses were as follows: (1) that, in line with Vygotsky-inspired \npredictions, there would be a quadratic (rather than linear) relation between task \ndifficulty and incidence of private speech; (2) that increasing task difficulty would \nlead to a predictable change in profile of sub-types of private speech, with a shift \ntowards a greater incidence of self-regulatory utterances; (3) that the incidence of \nself-regulatory private speech would be positively related with concurrent task \nperformance; (4) that the incidence of self-regulatory private speech would be \npositively related with future performance on the same task; and (5) that any speech\u2013\nperformance relations would be strongest on trials of intermediate complexity.  \nMethod \nParticipants \nParticipants were 46 children aged 5\u20136 years (21 female; age M = 71.2 mths, \nSD = 3.98; range 64 \u2013 78 mths) from two primary schools in an urban area of the \nPrivate Speech  9 \nEnglish Midlands. The demographic characteristics of the catchment areas of the two \nschools were similar, with children coming from a mixture of private and social \nhousing. The percentage of children at both schools entitled to free school meals \n(indicating socioeconomic disadvantage) was at the national average. All children \nspoke English as their first language. One of the children was mixed race, and the \nremainder were White.  \nProcedures \nOverview: Children participated in the study on two separate occasions a \nweek apart. In each session they were asked to complete 4 trials of the Tower of \nLondon (ToL) task.  \n Setting: Children were seated at a table in a quiet corner of the school, with \nthe female experimenter (E) sitting a short distance to one side. A portable video \ncamera mounted on a tripod was placed opposite the child, giving a clear view of the \ntask and the child\u2019s face. All sessions were videotaped and later coded for task-\nrelevant activity, social and private speech, and task performance.  \nTower of London (ToL task): In each testing session, participants attempted to \nsolve 4 different positions of a mechanical version of the ToL task. Two identical \ncopies of the ToL apparatus were used, each consisting of three pegs of different \nlengths inserted into a wooden base (20cm \u00d7 7cm \u00d7 2cm), and three coloured wooden \nballs (red, green and blue). The lengths of the pegs were such that one would \naccommodate three balls, one would accommodate two balls, and the smallest would \nonly accommodate one ball (see Figure 1). A total of 12 different configurations is \npossible on the ToL. Two can be solved in a minimum of 2 moves, two can be solved \nin 3 moves, four can be solved in 4 moves, and four can be solved in 5 moves. The 4 \ntrials in each session were presented in ascending order of difficulty, as follows: 2-\nPrivate Speech  10 \nmove, 3-move, 4-move and 5-move. A different group of 4 trials was presented in \neach session, making a total of 8 trials per participant. In each trial, the E presented \nthe child with one of the copies of the apparatus in the \u2018standard\u2019 configuration, and \nthen presented the other copy of the apparatus in one of the 12 target configurations. \nPresentation of the test trials was preceded by two warm-up trials, where only two \nballs (blue and green) were used. These warm-up trials were not coded.  \nThe procedure for the test trials was as follows. The E invited the child to sit \nat the table, and then showed the child the ToL apparatus, saying \u2018Would you like to \nplay this game?\u2019 One copy of the apparatus (set up in the standard configuration) was \nplaced in front of the child, and the other (set up in one of the target configurations) \nwas placed on the table just out of reach of the child. The E then explained the rules \nof the game, as follows: \u2018You have to make this (circling the apparatus nearest to the \nchild) look like this (circling the second, target apparatus). But there are some special \nrules you have to remember. You can only move one ball at a time. And you can only \nput the balls on the sticks, not on the table.\u2019 \nTo ensure that children only moved one ball at a time, they were encouraged \nto place their free hand behind their back while performing the task. Participants were \nthen told: \u2018Sometimes children like to talk aloud when they play this game. You can \ndo that if you like. I bet in class you have to be quiet! While playing this game you can \ntalk and say whatever you want to.\u2019 This instruction was included in response to \nFrauenglass and Diaz\u2019s (1985) observation that elicitation of task-relevant private \nspeech is maximized when children are given an explicit invitation to talk aloud to \nthemselves when working on a task.  \nThe two warm-up trials were then presented. The E began the test phase by \nsaying: \u2018I\u2019m going to make things different now. I\u2019m going to add this red ball.\u2019 The \nPrivate Speech  11 \nfirst target configuration was then prepared, and the E said: \u2018Now, can you make this \n(circling the standard apparatus) look like this?\u2019 (circling the target apparatus). \nTiming for performance measures began as soon as the E had finished this last \nutterance. The same time-point served as the starting point for subsequent videotape \ncoding of children\u2019s speech.  \nIf a child became stuck, distracted or upset, the E intervened, resetting the \npuzzle if necessary. In such instances, which were rare (less than 2% of trials), only \nthe second attempt at the problem was coded. At all other times the E sat quietly to \none side, answering any direct questions but otherwise keeping her involvement to a \nminimum.  \n Receptive verbal ability: After the Session 2 ToL trials, participants\u2019 receptive \nverbal ability was assessed using the British Picture Vocabulary Scale (Dunn, Dunn, \nWhetton, & Pintile, 1982).  \nMeasures \nTask performance: Performance on the ToL was assessed in both testing \nsessions. Two measures of task performance were used: moves to solution (MTS), and \ntime to solution (Time). In situations where the child ignored the rule about only \nmoving one ball at a time, the illegitimate moves were included in the MTS tally. It \nwas not deemed necessary to introduce any arbitrary penalty system to compensate \nfor illegitimate moves; instead, it was assumed that the difficulties of children who \nwere unable to follow the rule would be apparent from relatively higher MTS and \nTime scores.  \nToL performance was also considered globally, collapsing across all four \ntrials in each session. Two measures of global performance were used: (i) total time to \nsolution (Total Time), and (ii) the total move-value of trials solved correctly, in the \nPrivate Speech  12 \nminimum number of moves, without rule-breaking (Total Move-Value). This latter \nscore is identical to that used by Bull et al. (2004) for scoring performance on the \nToL, and similar to that of Bishop, Aamodt-Leeper, Creswell, McGurk, & Skuse \n(2001). For example, a child who solved one 2-move, one 3-move and one 5-move \ntrial in the minimum number of moves without rule-breaking would receive a score of \n10 (2+3+5). No score would be given for the failed 4-move trial. The maximum \npossible Total Move-Value score was therefore 14. This score is appropriate as it \nindicates the number of trials correctly solved, while also giving greater credit for \nsolution of the more complex trials.  \n Private speech: Private speech was coded from videotapes of Sessions 1 and 2 \nby an independent trained rater who was blind to the study\u2019s hypotheses. The coding \nprocess involved assigning each utterance to a superordinate category (social or \nprivate), and then further sub-dividing private utterances according to overtness and \ntask relevance. An utterance was defined as a unit of speech containing no temporal \nor semantic discontinuities, where a temporal discontinuity was defined as a pause of \nat least 2 seconds, and a semantic discontinuity included any change of content, \nwhether or not preceded by a pause. Utterances were then classified as social or \nprivate according to the following objective criteria (C = child, E = experimenter; \nFernyhough & Russell, 1997; adapted from Diaz, 1992; Furrow, 1992; Goudena, \n1992). An utterance was classified as social if: (1) Eye contact: C showed sustained \neye contact with E during or within 2 seconds of an utterance; (2) Behavioural: C\u2019s \nbehaviour involved E (through physical contact, gaze direction, etc.), or E\u2019s \nbehaviour involved C, within 2 seconds of the utterance; (3) Content markers: the \nutterance had the same topic as E\u2019s preceding utterance, or was a question directed to \nE, or contained a vocative or E\u2019s name; (4) Temporal contiguity: the utterance \nPrivate Speech  13 \noccurred less than 2s after any other social utterance. Any utterance that did not meet \nany of these criteria for social speech was classified as private.  \n Each private utterance was further assigned to one of the three categories of \nBerk\u2019s (1986) coding scheme: Level 1 private speech (PS1) (task-irrelevant private \nspeech, including word play and repetition, task-irrelevant affect expression, \ncomments to absent, imaginary or nonhuman others); Level 2 private speech (PS2) \n(task-relevant externalised private speech, including describing one\u2019s own activity \nand self-guiding comments, self-answered questions, task-relevant affect expression); \nLevel 3 private speech (PS3) (task-relevant external manifestations of inner speech, \nincluding inaudible muttering and whispering, and silent, verbal lip and tongue \nmovements). A randomly selected 16% of the videotapes was coded by a na\u00efve \nindependent trained rater. Inter-rater reliability for the four-way distinction between \nsocial speech, PS1, PS2 and PS3 was \u03ba = 0.80. Speech measures were divided by time \nspent on the task to give rate scores for each category (utterances per minute).  \n Teachers\u2019 ratings of talkativeness: In addition to these objective measures of \nchildren\u2019s speech, participants\u2019 class teachers were asked to rate each child for \ngeneral talkativeness. Teachers were simply asked, \u2018On a scale from 0 to 10, how \ntalkative would you say [name] is?\u2019 \nResults \nIncidence of social and private speech \nTable 1 shows the mean frequency measures for the different categories of \nsocial and private speech in Sessions 1 and 2, collapsed across all 4 trials. (The \ndifference in ns is a result of one child failing to complete Session 2.) The overall \nrates of social and private speech in this study are comparable to those reported in \nother studies (e.g. Frauenglass & Diaz, 1985; Winsler et al., 2000). Paired samples t-\nPrivate Speech  14 \ntests showed no significant differences in speech rates between the two sessions, t[44] \n= -1.34 \u2013 1.71, n.s. As Table 1 shows, there was high inter-individual variability in \nthe incidence of private speech, with standard deviations equal to or greater than \ngroup means (cf. Berk & Garvin, 1984). 89% of children produced at least one private \nutterance over both testing sessions.  \n Table 1 also shows intra-measure correlation coefficients for the four speech \ncategories between Sessions 1 and 2. Rates of Level 3 private speech (PS3) were not \nsignificantly correlated between Sessions 1 and 2, suggesting that children who \nproduced this form of speech in Session 1 were no longer doing so by Session 2. The \ninter-session correlation for Level 1 private speech (PS1) was not computable because \nof the absence of any such utterances in Session 1. Generally speaking, the very low \nincidence of Level 1 (overt, task-irrelevant) utterances in this study reflects the highly \ntask-relevant nature of the private speech produced on this task, and is consistent with \nprevious research with children of this age range (e.g., Winsler, de Leon, Wallace, \nCarlton, & Willson-Quayle, 2003).  \n Associations between teachers\u2019 ratings of children\u2019s talkativeness were \ninvestigated for children\u2019s Session 1 speech. Although all of these correlations were \npositive, none was significant (rs[44] = 0.13 to 0.15) except for that with PS2, r[44] = \n0.37, p < .05, two-tailed. In addition, the overall rate of private speech was marginally \nsignificantly positively correlated with rate of social speech at Session 1, r[44] = 0.24, \np < .06, one-tailed. Neither BPVS scores nor age were related to any of the speech \nmeasures in this session.  \nTower of London performance \nTable 2 shows the mean moves-to-solution (MTS) and untransformed time-to-\nsolution (Time) for each of the 4 trials in both testing sessions. One advantage of the \nPrivate Speech  15 \nToL is that it provides a measure of task difficulty which can be treated either \ncontinuously (Schall, Johnson, Lagopoulos, J\u00fcptner, Jentzen, Thienel, Dittmann-\nBal\u00e7ar, Bender, & Ward, 2003) or categorically (Baker, Rogers, Owen, Frith, Dolan, \nFrackowiak, & Robbins, 1996). In the analyses that follow, task difficulty is treated as \na categorical variable in analyses of variance, with quadratic and linear models tested \nfor significance.  \nA 2 (Session) \u00d7 4 (Task Difficulty) repeated measures ANOVA on the MTS \nscores showed no main effect of Session, F[1,44] = 2.75, n.s., suggesting that there were \nno overall practice effects caused by repetition of the task in Session 2. As expected, \nthere was a significant main effect of Task Difficulty, F[3,132] = 81.39, p < .001, with \nmean MTS increasing linearly with Task Difficulty, F[1,44] = 237.65, p<.001. There \nwas also a marginally significant interaction between Session and Task Difficulty, \nF[3,132] = 2.60, p = 0.06. Although the non-significance of this interaction means that it \nwas not appropriate to investigate it further, inspection of Table 2 suggests that this \nmay have been caused by faster solutions of the simplest tasks in Session 2, combined \nwith slower solutions to the more complex tasks.  \n In order to reduce skewness in the distribution, Total Time scores were first \nlog-transformed (cf. Langdon & Coltheart, 1999; Pantelis et al., 1997). A 2 (Session) \n\u00d7 4 (Task Difficulty) repeated measures ANOVA on the log-transformed Time scores \nshowed a main effect of Session, F[1,44] = 42.76, p < .001, with Session 2 positions \nbeing solved significantly faster. As expected, there was a main effect of Task \nDifficulty, F[3,132] = 65.37, p < .001, with solution times increasing linearly with Task \nDifficulty, F[1,44] = 168.92, p<.001. There was also a significant interaction between \nSession and Task Difficulty, F[3,132] = 12.75, p < .001. Simple effects analyses showed \nthe cause of this interaction to be significantly faster times to solution in Session 2 for \nPrivate Speech  16 \nthe two simplest tasks (2-move trials, t[45] = 4.17, p <.001; 3-move trials, t[45] = 7.61, p \n<.001). This suggests that any practice effects caused by the repetition of the task in \nSession 2 were restricted to the simpler (2-move and 3-move) trials.  \n The global task performance measures, Total Time and Total Move-Value, for \nSession 1 showed modest associations with age (r[44] = -0.14, n.s., and r[44] = 0.31, p < \n.05, two-tailed, respectively) but not with BPVS (r[44] = 0.07, n.s., and r[44] = -0.18, \nn.s., respectively). Note that the (non-significant) negative association between Total \nTime and age indicates a positive age\u2013performance relation, with older children \nrecording faster times to solution. The lack of any association between receptive \nverbal ability and either speech measures or ToL performance meant that BPVS \nscores were not considered further in subsequent analyses. Correlations within the \nglobal task performance measures across Sessions 1 and 2 were computed, partialling \nout age. For log-transformed Total Time, r[42] = 0.32, p < .05; for Total Move-Value, \nr[42] = 0.15, n.s. (two-tailed tests). At Session 1, the two global performance measures \nwere highly correlated with each other (again partialling out age), r[43] = -0.55, p < \n.001, with longer times to solution being associated with a lower total move-value for \ncorrect solutions. There was no correlation between the two measures at Session 2, \nr[42] = -0.23, n.s. (two-tailed tests).   \nPrivate speech and task difficulty \nIn line with Behrend et al.\u2019s (1989) reading of Vygotsky\u2019s theory, Hypothesis \n1 predicted a quadratic relation between self-regulatory private speech and task \ndifficulty, with the highest incidence of such speech expected on tasks that were \nneither too easy nor too difficult for the child. It is important to note that baseline \nmeasures of performance on this task were not taken, meaning that it was impossible \nto determine a priori which tasks would be easy or difficult for any particular child. \nPrivate Speech  17 \nThat said, one advantage of the ToL is that judgements about difficulty can be made \non the basis of analyses of the cognitive demands of individual task trials (e.g., Bull et \nal., 2004) rather than on post hoc assessments of performance. In light of previous \nresearch with this task and this age-group (e.g. Bull et al., 2004), we had reason to \nassume that the ToL trials would fall within the general competence range of our \nsample. In support of this assumption, performance on the simplest trials was \ngenerally very high, and none of the children in our study appeared unable to get \nstarted on the more difficult trials. \nIn order to investigate changes in speech rates with increasing task difficulty, \na 2 (Session) \u00d7 4 (Task Difficulty) \u00d7 4 (Speech Type) ANOVA was conducted with \nspeech rate as the dependent variable. There was no main effect of Session, F[1,44] < 1, \nn.s. There were main effects of Task Difficulty, F[3,132] = 4.56, p < .01, and Speech \nType, F[3,132] = 12.30, p < .001, and no interactions. The effect of Task Difficulty was \nfound to fit a quadratic model, F[1,44] = 8.73, p < .005 (for the linear model, F < 1, \nn.s.). These results thus provide support for Hypothesis 1, in that speech peaked when \ntasks were of intermediate levels of complexity. The lack of any significant \ninteraction between Speech Type and Task Difficulty suggests that, contrary to \nHypothesis 2, there were no changes in private speech sub-type profiles as Task \nDifficulty increased. Rather, the incidence of all forms of speech peaked when tasks \nwere of moderate difficulty. These findings are represented graphically in Figure 2. \nNote that, because of the lack of any main effect of Session, speech data in this figure \nare collapsed across both sessions.  \nPrivate speech and task performance \n 1. Global correlations: To test Hypotheses 3 and 4, global correlations were \ncomputed for Session 1 and Session 2 private speech (PS2 and PS3) and task \nPrivate Speech  18 \nperformance measures, partialling out age. To control for differences in overall \nverbosity, a second covariate was partialled out, namely the rate of social speech \n(utterances per minute) averaged across both testing sessions. The rationale for this \nrelates to the finding, reported above, that all speech forms peaked on moderately \ndifficult tasks. We therefore wished to determine whether it was self-regulatory \nprivate speech specifically that was related to task performance, or use of any kind of \nspeech, including social. The resulting correlations are shown in Table 3. Session 1 \nPS2 was associated with significantly faster times to solution in Session 1, but \nshowed no association with performance in Session 2. Session 1 PS3 was associated \nwith higher Total Move-Value scores in Session 1, but showed no association with \nperformance in the subsequent session. To control for the possibility that any relation \nwith subsequent performance might be masked by individual differences in ability on \nthe task, these correlations were recomputed partialling out Session 1 time-to-\nsolution. The correlations between Session 1 PS and Session 2 performance remained \nnon-significant (rs = -0.04 to 0.08, n.s.). Thus, our findings show support for \nHypothesis 3 (concerning concurrent speech\u2013performance relations) but not \nHypothesis 4 (namely, that use of private speech would relate to future task \nperformance).  \n 2. Position-by-position analyses: If assumptions about the self-regulatory role \nof private speech are correct, associations between private speech and task \nperformance should be strongest on tasks of intermediate complexity (Hypothesis 5). \nOn this reasoning, when a task is simple it can be solved without the need for self-\nregulatory speech, while on the most complex tasks self-regulation is unlikely to be \neffective. To accommodate the possibility that global correlations between private \nspeech and task performance may mask interesting interactions with task difficulty \nPrivate Speech  19 \n(e.g. Diaz, 1992, Winsler et al., 1997), separate correlation coefficients between \nprivate speech (PS2 and PS3) and time to solution were computed for each of the four \ndifficulty levels at Session 1, partialling out age and rate of social speech (see Table \n4). None of these correlations attained statistical significance. In particular, \nHypothesis 5 would predict that speech\u2013performance correlations on the simplest (2-\nmove) and most complex (5-move) tasks would be close to zero, while those for the \nintermediate tasks (3-move and 4-move) would be significantly negative (indicating \npositive relations between speech and performance). No evidence for this pattern is \nfound.  \n 3. Item-by-item speech\u2013performance combinations: Winsler et al. (2000) \nargue that each task-item in private speech research should be analysed separately for \nthe coincidence of task-relevant speech with task success or failure. Following this \nexample, each trial in each session was coded according to the type of speech that \naccompanied it, and whether it resulted in success or failure. For these purposes, task \nsuccess was defined as solving the puzzle in the minimum number of moves without \nrule-breaking; any other outcome was classified as failure. Three categories of speech \naccompaniment were used: relevant (task-relevant private speech, i.e. PS2 and PS3), \nirrelevant (task-irrelevant private speech [PS1] and social speech), and silence. The \ncategory relevant was superordinate to irrelevant, meaning that any incidence of task-\nrelevant speech on an item led to a coding of relevant.  \n Table 5 shows how the frequencies of each of the six possible speech\u2013\noutcome combinations varied with task difficulty. Our findings show some support \nfor the Vygotskian view of the relation between private speech, task difficulty and \ntask performance. For the simplest puzzle (2-move), the most frequent combination \nwas silence\/success, supporting the view that children are able to solve these puzzles \nPrivate Speech  20 \nwithout the use of overt private speech. For the next two levels of difficulty (3-move \nand 4-move), the most frequent combination was relevant\/success. For the most \ncomplex trials (5-move), the most frequent combination was relevant\/failure. As \nexpected, the overall percentage of successful items decreased with task difficulty, \nfrom 86.9% for the simplest puzzles to 52.2% for the most challenging. However, \nbecause of confounding of between-subject and within-subject variables, further \nstatistical analysis of these data is unwarranted.  \nDiscussion \nThe aim of the present study was to investigate a number of hypotheses about private \nspeech, task difficulty and task performance. By choosing a task that combined \nmanageable outcome measures with a continuously variable level of difficulty, we \nwere able to make a number of methodological improvements on previous private \nspeech research. Levels of private speech were comparable to previous studies, intra-\nmeasure correlations showed the speech measures to be reasonably stable between the \ntesting sessions, and there was evidence for an association between private and social \nspeech levels. Class teachers\u2019 ratings of children\u2019s general talkativeness showed a \nmodest degree of correlation with these experimental speech measures. Task \nperformance measures were moderately well correlated with each other, and showed a \npredictable relation with task difficulty. Finally, the fact that the majority of children \nin our study engaged in at least some private speech is in line with recent findings of \nsupport for Vygotsky\u2019s conjecture that private speech represents a universal stage in \ndevelopment (Matuga, 2003; Winsler et al., 2003). \n Our first hypothesis concerned the relation between private speech and task \ndifficulty. Our use of a continuously variable measure of task difficulty meant that we \nwere able to conduct a strict test of Vygotsky-inspired ideas about the relation \nPrivate Speech  21 \nbetween private speech and task difficulty, namely that the incidence of private \nspeech will peak when the task is neither too simple nor too difficult. In line with the \nfindings of Behrend et al. (1989), we found a quadratic relation between task \ndifficulty and incidence of the different speech sub-types, with the highest levels of \nspeech occurring on tasks of medium difficulty. The pattern of means was shown to \nfit a quadratic model, thus providing support for our first hypothesis.  \n Our second hypothesis was that increasing task difficulty would lead to a \npredictable change in private speech sub-type profiles, with a shift towards greater \nincidence of self-regulatory utterances (PS2 and PS3). Analyses of the private speech \ndata across all four levels of difficulty gave no support to this prediction, with no \ninteraction between Speech Type and Task Difficulty. Indeed, all forms of speech \n(including social) showed the relation with task difficulty. The lack of any interaction \nhere may have been due in part to the very low incidence of the least developmentally \nadvanced form of private speech, overt task-irrelevant private speech (PS1). It seems \nplausible that the school context in which the task was presented, and the demanding \nnature of the task, ensured that children\u2019s attention was task-focused from the very \nstart. A less formal context of problem-solving might be expected to produce higher \nlevels of task-irrelevant speech, particularly on the simpler tasks, and thus a greater \nlikelihood of a changing profile of private speech sub-types with increasing task \ndifficulty.  \n Hypotheses 3 and 4 concerned the relation between private speech and task \nperformance. The preceding analyses showed that all speech forms showed the \nquadratic relation with task difficulty; therefore, it was essential to establish whether \nit was private speech per se, or speech in general, that was associated with task \nperformance. First, we considered whether the incidence of PS2 and PS3 correlated \nPrivate Speech  22 \nwith global measures of concurrent task performance, when controls were made for \noverall verbosity. In support of Hypothesis 3, Session 1 PS2 was significantly \ncorrelated with concurrent time-to-solution, and Session 2 PS3 was associated with \ntotal move-value scores. This provides support for the idea that it is specifically \nprivate speech, rather than social speech, that is associated with concurrent task \nperformance. Contrary to Hypothesis 4, there was no relation between Session 1 \nprivate speech and global measures of performance in Session 2, and this lack of \nassociation was maintained even when Session 1 performance was included as a \ncovariate. We therefore found no support for the proposal of Frauenglass and Diaz \n(1985) that private speech will be more positively associated with future than with \nconcurrent performance.  \nOur final hypothesis was that patterns of speech\u2013performance relations would \nrelate to task difficulty, with the strongest associations between speech and \nperformance appearing on tasks of intermediate complexity. Separate speech\u2013\nperformance correlations for each level of difficulty showed no support for this \nhypothesis. Although violation of statistical assumptions meant that their patterns \ncould not be tested for statistical significance, relative frequencies of the six possible \nspeech\u2013outcome combinations formed a predictable pattern, with the simplest tasks \nmost frequently associated with silence and success, and the most complex tasks \ntending to be associated with task-relevant private speech and failure.  \n The present study has thus provided useful data on Vygotskian hypotheses \nabout the relations between private speech, task difficulty and task performance. In \nthe main, our findings are consistent with Vygotsky\u2019s view that private speech \nrepresents a developmental waystation between social speech and inner speech. \nLevels of self-regulatory private speech were positively correlated with concurrent \nPrivate Speech  23 \ntask performance, showed a quadratic relation with task difficulty, and demonstrated \nmeaningful patterns of speech\u2013performance relations on item-by-item analyses. One \nhypothesis that was not supported was the suggestion that private speech would relate \nmore strongly to more strongly to future than to concurrent task performance. Our \nfindings are thus at odds with the small number of studies that have reported such \nrelations. \nA closer look at these earlier studies suggests some possible reasons for this \ndiscrepancy. Firstly, Behrend et al. (1992) used undifferentiated measures of private \nspeech, failing to distinguish between task-irrelevant and task-relevant utterances. It \nseems plausible that, if care is taken to consider the content of private utterances, \nrelations with concurrent performance should emerge. Indeed, in a study that \ndistinguished task-relevant from task-irrelevant speech, Azmitia (1992) found \nevidence that both concurrent and future performance were related to task-relevant \nprivate speech. Another study reporting relations with future but not concurrent \nperformance (Bivens & Berk, 1990) looked at children\u2019s mathematics achievement a \nfull year after private speech measures were taken, a much longer timescale than that \nproposed by Diaz (1992). Finally, Winsler et al. (1997) only considered immediate \npost-test improvements that occurred as a consequence of adult scaffolding, and did \nnot make the typical distinction between social and private speech.  \n We suggest, then, that if care is taken to distinguish sub-types of private \nspeech, to distinguish social from private speech, and to choose a task which is both \nappropriate to the elicitation of private speech and which leads to rich outcome \nmeasures, relations between private speech and task performance may become more \nvisible. A further desideratum for future research is that it employ a longitudinal \nmethodology. Such an approach has already begun to prove fruitful in this area (e.g. \nPrivate Speech  24 \nWinsler et al., 2000). One of the most valuable contributions that might emerge from \nsuch studies is a better understanding of the minority of children who, at any given \ntime, appear to use no private speech at all. This may be because such children have \nalready fully internalised private speech, or alternatively because they have not yet \ngot started on the internalisation process described by Vygotsky. \nAnother challenge for future research is to determine whether, even after \ninternalisation, overt self-regulatory private speech can have a facilitatory effect on \nperformance. As noted in the Introduction, Vygotsky\u2019s claim that private speech \n\u2018goes underground\u2019 during the early school years has received only modest support \n(e.g. Berk & Garvin, 1984; Berk & Potts, 1991). One possibility is that, even after \nchildren have largely internalised private speech, they continue to employ overt self-\nregulation when the task is sufficiently demanding. Such re-emergence (Fernyhough, \nin press) of already-internalised private speech might help to explain the apparent \ndiscrepancy between the very early appearance of private speech (Furrow, 1984; \nFurrow, 1992), and its persistence into later childhood and adulthood. Rather than \nproviding a window onto internalisation, it is possible that, for some individuals, \nprivate speech in problem-solving contexts reflects a movement from internal to \nexternal self-regulation which can temporarily reverse transitions made earlier in \ndevelopment. Again, only careful longitudinal research can answer this question \nsatisfactorily.   \nPrivate Speech  25 \nReferences \nAzmitia, M. (1992).
