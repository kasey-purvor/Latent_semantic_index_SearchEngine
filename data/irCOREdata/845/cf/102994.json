I \ndiscuss the rationale behind my methodological decisions with reference to the \npractitioner\/researcher boundary and how a degree of reflexivity is necessary \nwhen making methodological decisions. Reflexivity is the capacity to reflect \nupon one\u2019s actions and values during the research, when producing data and \nwriting accounts and to view the beliefs we hold in the same way that we view \nthe beliefs of others (Seale 1998, Gouldner 1972).  Reflexivity is a characteristic \nof the ethnographic imagination and establishes the researchers\u2019 integrity, which \nis part of good ethnographic practice (Brewer 1994).  I discuss what it means to \nbe a researcher and a practitioner and how this dual nature was represented in \nmy research and what it means for the data collected.  I discuss how I \nexperienced the feeling of being an \u2018insider\u2019, a practitioner as well as \nexperiencing that of feeling an \u2018outsider\u2019. I reflect on how such insider and \noutsider moments were revealed to me.  I discuss the feelings, emotions and \ntensions that can occur in the researcher when s\/he attempts to keep to a \nmarginal positioning on the boundary between the practitioner and researcher \nidentities and how this tension was resolved with reference to the lived \nexperience of my research.  \nMy study was conducted within the medical speciality of palliative care with a \nfocus on how the palliative care team orientates to the concept of \u2018total pain\u2019. \nThe study was set up as a comparative study in three settings: hospice, hospital \nand community palliative care settings (Arber 2004). I am interested in the \nhospice and palliative care concept of \u2018total pain\u2019 (Clark 1999). Cicely \nSaunders, the founder of the modern hospice movement, sought to \u2018humanise\u2019 \nthe dying process through the concept of \u2018total pain\u2019, the gestaltian notion that \nthe social, emotional, spiritual and physical each entwined contributing to the \n\u2018total pain\u2019 experience (Saunders 1996).  I was interested in how practitioners in \npalliative care orientate to this concept and how they talked about patients in \npain.  In this article I am going to discuss the fieldwork carried out within the \nhospice and community setting. In designing my research I was concerned with \na number of issues, one of which was the sensitivity of the setting, where \npatients are generally extremely ill and dying.  So when planning my research I \nwished to gather data with minimum disruption to work routines within the \nhospice. I was also concerned about avoiding the danger that my presence would \ninterrupt the work of the staff and that my presence as an observer would cause \nNegotiating access        9th April05 4 \nany undue distress to staff\/patients. I was aware that many hospice staff would \nknow about the concept of \u2018total pain\u2019.  For example they may have read about it \nand talked about it during their education and practice.  So I wished to avoid a \nsituation where I was exposed to the rhetoric of palliative care rather than the \npractices, which occur in this setting. My research design therefore included \naudio recording of palliative care team meetings and fieldwork concerned with \nobserving staff during ward rounds and shadowing staff when visiting patients \nin their home. The concerns and constraints identified above are what I \nperceived to be important in designing my research. I sought to combine \nsubjective and objective methods of data collection by combining observation \nwith the audio-recording of naturally occurring data.  \nFraming the study: a naturalistic approach \nI framed the study within the naturalistic paradigm of an ethnographic study.  \nMy intention was to spend time in the research field observing as much as I \ncould of the action in relation to the problem of pain. The naturalistic approach \nto research includes attending to what informants tell you and beginning to \nunderstand what things mean to them (Gubrium & Holstein 1997). One of the \ndifficulties of the naturalistic approach is that of maintaining \u2018distance\u2019, for \nexample by getting up close to the action one might overlook the more \ninteresting aspects of what is going on (Gubrium & Holstein 1997).  Terms such \nas \u2018bracketing\u2019 and \u2018suspending\u2019 have been coined to alert the researcher to the \nissues of distance and the aim of objectivity when a researcher is studying one\u2019s \nown tribe for example (Pollner 1987).  The issue of distance is important. As a \nnurse I am familiar with the medical world, its specialised language and culture \nand I feel at home in this world. This familiarity, I reasoned, might blind me to \ncertain aspects of the setting that I took for granted.  Thus I felt I needed to get \nas close as I could to the action but to balance this by stepping back so that an \neye is cast on how everyday realities are experienced (Gubrium & Holstein \n1997).  It is suggested that to learn participants meanings, we need to not only \nbe reflexive about our own meanings but to attempt to \u2018flow\u2019 with the \nexperiences in the world that is studied (Charmaz 2004).  Therefore I made a \ndecision to audio record naturally occurring data such as nursing handovers and \npalliative care team meetings as well as shadowing and observing staff.  \nFollowing Silverman (2001:159) data which is naturally occurring exist \nindependently of the researcher\u2019s intervention, so to some extent this data has a \ndegree of objectivity in that it is not \u2018researcher provoked\u2019 data. I felt that this \nNegotiating access        9th April05 5 \ncombined approach to data collection would enable a balance between closeness \nand distance, incorporating a degree of subjectivity by participating and \nobserving in the field (making field notes), balanced by collecting naturally \noccurring data that was audio recorded.  This combined approach may shed light \non the tacit and implicit that may not be easily shared as they are taken-for-\ngranted (Charmaz 2004). \nMaking contact, gaining access and acceptability \nAs an experienced practitioner in the field of cancer care I had a network of \nexisting contacts on which to draw to enable me to gain access to a hospice \nsetting.  However, I still felt concerned about whether I would gain access. Back \n(2002) describes the \u2018real sense of trepidation\u2019 when it comes to beginning your \nresearch\u2019 and worrying about contacting people.  For example Lawton (2000) an \nanthropologist found initial access to a hospice setting difficult.  However, once \nshe gained the trust of the hospice professionals in the day care unit she was \ngranted free access within the hospice and successfully completed her research \ntaking on the role of a volunteer. Hospice staff understandably feel protective \ntoward their patients as they are usually very ill or have very advanced disease. \nWhile I was negotiating access to the hospice setting with senior practitioners I \nwas also submitting the study to a local ethics committee and approval was \ngranted for the study. \nMy first point of contact was with a local hospice.  However the hospice was \ngoing through major organisational change and my key contact (a senior nurse) \nhad left the hospice suddenly.  I made a decision not to pursue entry to this \nhospice. From this experience I decided that when I approached another hospice \nI would make early contact with the medical director as well as senior nursing \nstaff. I approached a second hospice.  The senior nurse at this hospice was very \ninterested in my research and she acted as my sponsor and I was given direct \naccess to the Medical Director. Gatekeepers have the power to grant or block \naccess within a setting and they have expectations about the ethnographer\u2019s \nidentity and intentions.  In this setting I felt that the gatekeepers were keen to \nsponsor research and to perhaps encourage good relations with the university \nwhere I worked.  It is important as to ascertain whether the host community sees \nthe researcher as an expert and thus someone to be welcomed or a critic and \nvery unwelcome (Hammersley and Atkinson 1995). At this stage I believe I was \nbeing positioned toward the expert status rather than the critic as I had built up a \nNegotiating access        9th April05 6 \ngood relationship with the senior nurse.  However, I did feel uneasy about being \npositioned as some kind of expert and I will come back to this later.  \nI was invited in to the hospice to meet with the Medical Director and he showed \nme around the hospice and introduced me to many of the staff.  When we went \ninto the community team office I realised I knew one of the community nurses \nas she had attended one of the courses I teach on.  She greeted me in a friendly \nmanner and the Medical Director said, \u2018She speaks well of you.  This is payback \ntime\u2019.  I realised that this link may help my acceptability with other staff.  \nLawton (2000) describes how once she had developed good rapport with day \ncare staff it was then easy to set up her second project within the hospice as the \nhospice staff had heard positive reports about her fieldwork. I had two concerns \nabout going into the palliative care settings to carry out research.  Firstly, if I \nwas to be attributed with an identity as some kind of expert I didn\u2019t think I could \nbring it off. Of course I am familiar with aspects of hospice and palliative care \nbut my own nursing experience is with patients with cancer. I have not worked \nin a specialised palliative care culture or hospice. I therefore consider myself an \noutsider within this context. Secondly, it may be thought that I was in some \nsense overly inquisitive and\/or attempting to evaluate the work going on in such \nsettings. To combat the potential for these concerns surfacing I worked to appear \nrelaxed and agreeable.  My goal was to enable all levels of staff to feel \ncomfortable when I was around. I decided to carry off the research role by \nworking at a demeanour of approachability, and to push the help I needed from \nthem to accomplish my research. Coffey & Atkinson (1996) say that one cannot \ncontrol how others perceive your participation. I agree with this but I believe \nyou can manage it.   My impression management was an outward demeanour of \nbeing friendly, to watch and listen, greet people, and to use good eye contact. I \ndecided not to ask too many questions, as this in itself might be perceived as \nthreatening to some people. This self-management did shape the data and meant \nthat I would avoid asking too many questions unless invited to do so. I worked \nat my non-verbal behaviour and attempted to look engaged, animated, alert and \ninterested in everything that was going on. This enabled me to have a degree of \nacceptability in such a setting I believe.  \nI wondered what social category the group would assign to me.  I decided when \nexplaining my research that I would emphasise the fact that I was a part-time \nresearch student combining my research toward a PhD while working as a \nlecturer. I felt that if I was perceived as an expert this would not help me as I \nNegotiating access        9th April05 7 \nwas not an expert in hospice work. Of course I did not want to be positioned as a \ncritic.  This would mean that people were defensive with me or might avoid me.  \nI monitored this by paying particular attention to how I was greeted and non-\nverbal behaviour towards me.  The social worker for example left a note for me \nwith my name and the title she gave me was, \u2018research nurse\u2019. The hospice \nmedical director described me as \u2018a very, very experienced nurse tutor\u2019 when he \nintroduced me to the community team. The nurses were concerned about who I \nwas rather than what I wanted.  For example the team leaders quickly found out \nabout where I lived, that I had children and that they went to local schools. This \nidentification helped to reduce feelings of social distance.  I felt that the team \nleaders were going to help me and were not going to put obstacles in my way. In \nthis context my social and family circumstances matched my hosts and this \nenabled me to present myself in a non-threatening way with the nurses. The \nethnographer should create different self-presentations for different settings \naccording to Walsh (2004). Being a mother and a nurse might help with some \npeople but I also had to pass as a credible researcher someone who knows what \nthey are doing when it comes to research. This identifies the dynamic nature of \npresenting oneself, which I found required constant work and monitoring of \noneself and others\u2019 reactions. \nI found that one of the most tiring aspects of being an ethnographer was finding \na balance between the different roles one has to play. I believe that being \nconstantly alert to how one is being positioned by the practitioners in the field as \nwell as positioning oneself to get the best out of the situation as emotionally \ntiring.  For example I always arrived at the hospice a little early so that I could \nget mentally prepared and psyched up for whatever would be required of me to \naccess data. Indeed Li (2002) explores the distressing situation when her \nfieldwork was almost scuppered by a hostile member of the nursing staff. At this \ntime Li experienced the emotional reaction of \u2018loathing and the desire to \nwithdraw\u2019 described by Lofland & Lofland (1984).  She managed to stay in the \nfield and complete her fieldwork by getting good support within her research \nand supervisory network.  Fortunately for her she found a sympathetic sponsor \nwithin the hospice team despite the resistance of one of the nurses. Many writers \nagree that in all stages of the ethnographic enterprise social relationships remain \nkey (Coffey 1999, Walsh 2004,  Hammersley and Atkinson 1995). I found that \nkeeping on good terms with people, avoiding looking strained or irritable \nrequires a degree of thought and emotion management similar I suspect to acting \nor going onstage (Goffman 1959). However, although social relationships need \nNegotiating access        9th April05 8 \nto be smoothed and negotiated as access to data often depends on these \nrelationships, rich data can also be acquired through being reflective when \nencountering resistance.  Persistence can pay off even in hostile territory if one \nhas the time to be patient and to get good support during the process (Lawton \n2000, Li 2002). \n Observer as participant \nI prepared to take on the role of observer as participant within the hospice \nsetting.  This role achieves the balance in favour of observation over  \nparticipation (Junker 1960).  According to Junker most overt ethnography takes \nup a position between the observer as participant and participant as observer \nroles.  Most writers agree that the marginal positioning is the best place to be \n(Junker 1960, Hammersley & Atkinson 1995).  However this can be difficult \nand can cause some emotional strain in keeping this positioning. For example \nFrank (2004)  says it can be difficult to keep your balance on a boundary in that \nwe can fall back in to ourselves or forward into the other.  This experience of \nfalling in to the \u2018other\u2019 was experienced by Rager (200) who describes how she \ncried together with her respondents during her research involving women with \nbreast cancer. Thus within a relationship one needs an acceptable level of \ndistance and difference so that there is a space between two people to enable \ndialogue, according to Frank.  Lofland & Lofland (1984) produce a typology of \ndifferent sources of  emotional stress caused by fieldwork namely, deception and \nfear of disclosure, loathing and the desire to withdraw, sympathy and the \nimpulse to help, marginality and the \u2018temptation to convert\u2019.  For my own work \nthe later two points are important. In the next section I will discuss the \n\u2018temptation to convert\u2019 to the complete participant sometimes referred to as, \n\u2018going native\u2019 and the pull back to being an observer.  I will discuss this tension \nin relation to a visit with one of the community palliative care nurses. \n \u2018Temptation to convert\u2019 \nI visited a patient with one of the community palliative care nurses. This was \ngoing to be a difficult visit as it had been presented problematically by the \npatient's district nurse (DN). The patient\u2019s husband was reported to have \ntouched the district nurse inappropriately and Rachel the community palliative \ncare nurse was quite anxious about this. This is what I recorded in my research \njournal: \n                    \nNegotiating access        9th April05 9 \n1 What is all the fuss about?  The patient\u2019s husband has had a stoke and sometimes \n2 this sort of behaviour can occur. Why is Rachel so edgy about the visit?  Perhaps it \n3 is because she is in the late stages of pregnancy. She is glad I am accompanying \n4 her on this visit. Perhaps I should be worried, there may be a \u2018scene\u2019 in the house \n5 and perhaps Rachel may become upset. \n 14th November 2000 Extract from research journal \n \n6 We visited Eileen today she looked slight, quiet, frail and worried I thought.  I \n7 wondered what exactly had gone on with the district nurse? Eileen\u2019s daughter was \n8 with her and she was very welcoming and friendly. There was no sign of the \n9 husband. As we entered the house I felt very alert and I surveyed the room and \n10 Rachel settled herself in an armchair near Eileen.  Then I found somewhere to sit \n11 facing the door so I could see anyone entering the room and to my left there was \n12 access to the kitchen.  I was making a mental note of all the exits from the room \n13 and I found myself rehearsing what to do should the husband appear and do \n14 something that upset Rachel and the family. Rachel started her assessment and I \n15 felt very alert and watchful. Rachel asked \u2018where is your husband?\u2019 and Eileen said \n16 he was upstairs as \u2018he gets up quite late\u2019.  I wondered if he had been told to stay \n17 upstairs until we had gone. After about one hour, I could hear the patient\u2019s husband \n18 moving about upstairs.  I thought \u2018oh no he is going to come downstairs now just \n19 as we are about to leave\u2019. I couldn\u2019t wait to get out of the house.  But I kept what  \n20 I hoped was a \u2018cool demeanour\u2019. \n 21st November 2000  Extract from research journal \n \n \n \nWhen we visited the patient I suddenly found myself in a situation where I \nmight have to take some action as I thought there might be a \u2018scene\u2019 in the \nhouse (line 4). I also was aware that Rachel was pleased I was accompanying \nher on the visit, perhaps then I had a part to play (line 3,4). I found I was \nworrying about physical and spacial safety by making note of all the exits and \nentrances from the room (line 12). I was rehearsing how to do emotional labour \nmanaging my own emotions (line 10) to prepare to save face for the family and \nfor Rachel should an incident occur (Hochschild 1983, Goffman 1959). I was \ntherefore completely involved in this situation thinking as a practitioner would; \nplanning where to sit to get a good view of the room (line 11); making mental \nnotes (line 12) and rehersing in my mind what to do (line 13). I enjoyed the \nfeeling of complete involvement and the fact that I had a part to play. I suppose I \nfelt useful. Gerrish (2003) a researcher and also a trained nurse describes how \nshe felt vulnerable when she visited a young woman with terminal breast cancer \nwith the district nurse. She felt the district nurse was using her as a colleague, \nsomeone who could listen to the district nurses concerns and a sense of \nreciprocity developed. Unlike Gerrish I did not feel vulnerable but I did \nexperience the sense of reciprocity with Rachel. Rather than being an observer, I \nwas completely involved in this situation and I like Rachel was worried about \nthis situation (line 18) despite my initial feeling of \u2018What is all the fuss about? \n(line 1.  \nNegotiating access        9th April05 10 \nHaving written down what happened in my research diary I forgot about this  \nincident until it was discussed at the palliative care team meeting a few days \nlater. When this visit was discussed in the team meeting I was asked a direct \nquestion about the visit: \n1 Nurse R: But when I was asking about the husband, I wanted to know how he was two \n2 years ago, before the stroke, you know, because and they were very hesitant about coming \n3 forward with that weren\u2019t they? \n4 AA: Mm. Mm \n5 Nurse R: We didn\u2019t get, what I expected them to say was oh he was a lovely man.  He was \n6 a lovely dad and it is such a shame.  We didn\u2019t get any of that.  She just looked down.  So, \n7 you know, I\u2019m not sure and apparently he\u2019s got a CPN as well and he goes to Smith wing \n8 to day-care because when he went to a normal day care he kept fondling everybody, he \n9 was, they put him in Smith Wing \n10 (Laughter) \n Audio-recording of palliative care team meeting \n  \nRachel sought my opinion about the visit at line 3, \u2018 they were very hesitant \nabout coming forward with that weren\u2019t they?\u2019 I could not frame a reply that I \nthought would be satisfactory, in effect I went blank.  This was uncomfortable \nfor me and I felt tense.  I got over the incident by encouraging Rachel to \ncontinue to tell the story herself by my response Mm Mm (line 4). I felt I was \nletting Rachel down by not being able to construct a reply that would sound \narticulate and meet the expectation of the team.  Rachel uses \u2018we\u2019 twice at lines \n5 and 6. I believe that in this talk Rachel is positioning me as a member of the \nteam, a colleague  through her use of \u2018we didn\u2019t get\u2019 (line 5) and again \u2018we \ndidn\u2019t get any of that\u2019 (line 6).  Together \u2018we\u2019 observed and experienced what is \nreported by Rachel and furthermore this was discussed between us in the car on \nthe way back to the hospice. However by not being able to reply in a satisfactory \nmanner I felt similar to that described by actors as \u2018corpsing\u2019.  I was completely \nfrozen and unable to respond in an appropriate manner.  I now understood \u2018the \nfear of disclosure\u2019 identified by Lofland & Lofland (1984).  I was not playing \nmy part as an insider properly I was not able to offer a fluent reply and this was \nbeing displayed in the meeting I thought.  \nAs the talk went on it became more humorous and in the next excerpt of data \nthere is laughter at my reported reaction to the incident, which relieved the \ntension I was feeling: \n \n \nNegotiating access        9th April05 11 \n \n1 Nurse R: He\u2019s does most of the time when he goes.  I mean apparently he doesn\u2019t like it.  He \n2 kicks up a bit of a stink about it but most of the time he goes.  So I think probably your safest \n3 to ring.  Make sure he\u2019s gone.  He was upstairs when we were there (laughing).  Anne had a \n4 quick getaway in the kitchen didn\u2019t you?  She worked it all out.  We were all right.  So it was \n5 okay.  But it was a bit very intimidating for carers and of course for her. \n Audio-recording of palliative care team meeting \n \nThe story was told with some humour and there was laughter about the situation \nand my reported reaction to this situation, \u2018She worked it all out. We were all \nright\u2019 (line 4).  In this utterance I am being presented as someone who \u2018worked \nit out\u2019 so Rachel is presenting me as competent in the situation even though I \nfelt I could not respond as a practitioner.  I also had not been able to tell Rachel \nthat I was worried about her safety and the \u2018quick getaway in the kitchen\u2019 (line \n4) was a strategy for me to be mobile and allow me to intervene if needed.  This \nincident in the team meeting made clear to me the tension of being in a marginal \nplace balancing involvement with detachment and I think this is what caused the \nfeeling of discomfort (Adler & Adler 1994). I did not think I could maintain \nobjectivity if I started to take on a status as a type of insider. A researcher who \ncannot stand back from the knowledge they have acquired may face analytic \nproblems (Coffey 1999).  I had not planned on being part of the action but \nclearly in this situation it was difficult to control.  Participant observation is \nreferred to as an \u2018oscillating situation\u2019 (Kirk & Miller 1986:7). The oscillating \nuncertainty on this occasion was around, which identity was going to be given, \nor withheld and the fact that I had to react in an appropriate manner. The tension \nthat this situation engendered in me was similar to the identity crisis discussed \nby Jarvie (1969). He says it is not possible to be both a stranger and a friend and \nthe identity crisis that may arise precipitates an integrity crisis and one role \noverrides the other to resolve the crisis. Thus for me the researcher role \noverrides the practitioner role at this meeting. My discomfort was relieved by \nRachel\u2019s use of humour and I felt she \u2018got me off the hook\u2019.  \nEthnography is often conducted by members of a culture or related cultures \nrather than by complete strangers and these cultures are not homogenous \n(Coffey 1999). So according to Coffey one can interrogate what is a stranger or \na member, or an outsider or an insider. She continues that a self is crafted \nthrough personal relationships and interactions between the researcher and those \nthat are researched. Thus the issue of identity is not fixed but malleable. My role \nand identity was therefore defined and re-defined by myself and by others and \nthis is what can cause discomforting feelings when expectations about identity \nNegotiating access        9th April05 12 \nare not shared at any given moment. Similarly Stanworth (2004) describes how \nher status as a researcher was transformed into confidante, confessor, comforter \nand judge when researching the sources of meaning of people who are dying. \nThis malleability and fluidity of identities given and taken is perhaps \ncharacteristic of all relationships.  However such identities and roles can also \nconstrain. I did feel uncomfortable when observing distressed patients and \nrelatives. For example one day the doctor had some sad news for the relatives of \na very sick patient.  The relatives broke down crying.  I felt in a dilemma \u2018what \nshould I do should I try and offer some comfort to the relatives as a nurse would \ndo?\u2019  I was aware that there was no nurse present. The tension between being a \nresearcher and a nurse was arising again but on this occasion I kept the \nresearcher boundary in place even though I felt very uncomfortable about this. I \nused my fieldwork journal to reflect on this experience.  I note in my research \njournal \u2018one of the most distressing aspects of observing distress is not being \nable to have an active role in relation to this\u2019.  By this I mean that a nurse would \nhave a part to play in consoling and comforting the relatives but a researcher can \nonly witness the distress and write about it. For the researcher to become a nurse \non this occasion I felt may cause some embarrassment for the team. Conversely \nit may have not been a problem for the team at all but a judgement I had made \nand a boundary I had put in place. \nStrategies for enabling reflexivity \nOne of the ways of enabling reflexivity is in keeping a fieldwork journal. \nKeeping journals as distinct from fieldnotes enables one to keep track of \ntheoretical perspectives and assumptions as well as keeping track of emotional \nreactions (Gilbert 2001). According to Lofland (1971:234) keeping a journal is \nnot only for recording the setting but \u2018for \u2018recording\u2019 the observer as well\u2019.  \nMost researchers and writers agree with this and keeping a journal may enable \nunderstanding through self-reflection and avoid a tendency to self-absorption \n(Kleinman & Copp 1993, Rosaldo 1989).  Thus closeness and distance is not \nonly about experiences and reflection on the field but also about how one feels \nand the emotions that may be engendered. Recording of personal opinions, \nemotional responses and responses to being an observer according to Lofland \n(1971) enable the observer to keep tract of such events, which may be useful \nlater when looking for leads during analysis.   This is a particular issue for those \nstudying members of a group to which they have membership or professional \naffiliation (Edwards 2002). There may be particular problem for clinicians such \nNegotiating access        9th April05 13 \nas therapists and nurses as they have to negotiate a research relationship rather \nthan a therapeutic relationship. Furthermore the therapist or nurse may feel a \ntension between the role of nurse or therapist and researcher, as highlighted \nearlier (Arber 2004, Gilbert 2001). \nI carefully completed a fieldwork journal every time I went in to the research \nsetting.  I also planned to give a conference paper on my fieldwork experience \n(Arber 2001). At this conference another researcher talked about his experience \nof ethnographic fieldwork describing how he felt scared to go into the acute \npsychiatric ward due to the threatening behaviour of a couple of patients (Quirk \n2001).  He expressed the same feeling that I had about getting myself psyched \nup to go into the research situation, but unlike Quirk I did not have a feeling of \nbeing scared but more a feeling of apprehension. I was not having regular \nsupervision meetings during my period of fieldwork in the hospice therefore the \nfeeling of isolation that could arise was balanced by belonging to a social \nnetwork of PhD students with time spent socialising and discussing research \ninformally (Wincup 2001).  Other strategies have been suggested for dealing \nwith the emotions engendered by  research include counselling, peer \ndebriefing\/review, \u2018creating space\u2019 and relaxation techniques  (Edwards 2002, \nRager 2005).  In fact Rager recommends that preparation for social science \nresearchers to include information on appropriate self-care strategies to avoid \n\u2018compassion stress\u2019.   \nCredibility and reliability \nThe types of \u2018self\u2019 that is presented within research may enable claims about \nauthenticity such as \u2018being there\u2019 and to enable the reader to judge the validity \nof the whole enterprise by being transparent about the \u2018goings on\u2019 in the field \n(The 2002, Seale 1999).  Credibility and reliability can be improved by firstly \nidentifying the particular status position taken by the researcher, as this sheds \nlight on what can and cannot be observed. For example Li (2002) was unable to \nobserve \u2018critical moments\u2019 as staff indicated her presence in the patient\u2019s room \nwas not welcome. Therefore some of the data she presents reflects her role as an \noutsider. As Lee (1993:6) points out the feelings engendered in researching \nsensitive topics such as death and dying mean that the researcher as well as the \nresearched may have to share feelings \u2018of unease, discomfort or emotional pain\u2019. \nThese feelings may then affect what we are allowed and prepared to observe. \nSecondly it is important to be reflective about who offered data and the context \nin which it was offered.  Finally there should be a full account of theories that \nNegotiating access        9th April05 14 \ninformed the research (LeCompte & Goetz 1982).  These are all components of \nreflexivity and help the reader to assess the credibility of research findings \naccording to Seale (1999). In fact part of an \u2018audit trail\u2019 of the research process \nshould include independent examination of entries in the researchers\u2019 research \njournal identifying daily activities, and sampling techniques for example (Seale \n1999, Lincoln & Guba 1985).  I believe that documenting one\u2019s feelings and \nemotions about the identities and roles assumed and taken can also be a useful \npart of the audit trail. Participant observation is conscious work requiring the \nobserver to understand the process of transformation, which s\/he undergoes, by \nbeing present in the field (Baszanger & Dodier 1997). Thus during the research \njourney the researcher describes in what capacity s\/he was present and the place \ns\/he occupied in these events.  \nDiscussion \nIn this article I explore the importance of reflexivity throughout the \nethnographic research journey.  The experience of being an outsider, an insider \nand on the boundary between these two roles can cause some strain for the \nresearcher. I have reflected on some moments where I experienced being an \ninsider and an outsider and the self-management involved to maintain my \nfooting as a researcher and sometimes unexpectedly as a practitioner. The \n\u2018temptation to convert\u2019 is discussed as a seductive option as this allows a feeling \nof homeostasis across the insider outsider boundary, which enables the \nresearcher to be \u2018at home\u2019 in the practitioner role.  Having an identity as an \ninsider allows access to data that may not be accessed by an outsider. Keeping a \nresearch journal, which documents the researcher\u2019s feelings and emotions, \nenables the ethnographer to remain cognisant of how the field and relationships \nshape the researcher and the research.  Keeping a journal also enables the \nresearcher as an embodied presence to be tracked and placed within the research \nas an emotional, feeling subject. For practitioners as ethnographers the \ncredibility of one\u2019s research is dependent upon a degree of reflexivity about \none\u2019s theoretical and methodological assumptions, and how these are \nexperienced in field experiences. \nConclusion \nIn conclusion the ethnographer needs a level of preparedness for undertaking \ndemanding fieldwork in the context of healthcare whether they have a \npractitioner\/therapist background or not. A reflexive approach enables one to \nNegotiating access        9th April05 15 \nunderstand how the researcher who is also a practitioner has an impact on those \nresearched.  It also means that a researcher with such a background should \ninterrogate their own beliefs and feelings in the same way that they interrogate \nthose of others. Thus at all stages in the research the impact of the researcher in \nterms of access to data, relationships in the field, and how one is addressed as a \nresearcher, as a practitioner or both should be documented and become part of \none\u2019s analysis. Good support is essential for the researcher including informal \nsupport such as that provided by one\u2019s colleagues and peer group.  This is \nbecause the researcher requires a degree of self management and sometimes \nemotional labour to fit into the research setting, manage relationships and deal \nwith untoward situations with some skill while maintaining the balancing act \nacross the insider outsider boundary. Supervisors should be knowledgeable \nabout how to support students appropriately for example listening to the \nstudent\u2019s experience, reading the fieldwork journal and encouraging regular \nsupervision during fieldwork experiences. It is recommended, as part of good \npractice, that self care strategies such as \u2018time out\u2019, relaxation techniques, \ndebriefing and counselling strategies should be discussed with the ethnographer \nand carefully considered before, during and after fieldwork experiences.  \nNegotiating access        9th April05 16 \nReferences \nAdler PA & Adler P (1994) \"Observational techniques\".
