The latter are dominated by soil surface CO[subscript 2] flux (F[subscript s]), which is still subject to large uncertainties. Fire is generally regarded as the most important factor influencing succession in the boreal forest biome and fire dependant species such as jack pine are widespread. In May 2007, we took concurrent F[subscript s] and soil temperature (T[subscript s]) measurements in boreal jack pine fire scars aged between 0 and 59 years since fire. To allow comparisons between scars, we adjusted F[subscript s] for T[subscript s] (F[subscript s,superscript T]) using a Q[subscript 10] of 2. Mean F[subscript s,superscript T] ranged from 0.56 (\u00b1 0.30 sd) to 1.94 (\u00b1 0.74 sd) \u03bcmol CO[subscript 2] m[superscript \u22122] s[superscript \u22121]. Our results indicate a difference in mean F[subscript s,superscript T] between recently burned (4 to 8 days post fire) and non-burned mature (59 years since fire) forest (P < 0.001), though no difference was detected between recently burned (4 to 8 days post fire) and non-burned young (16 years since fire) forest (P = 0.785). There was a difference in mean F[subscript s,superscript T] between previously young (16 years since fire) and intermediate aged (32 years since fire) scars that were both subject to fire in 2007 (P < 0.001). However, there was no difference in mean F[subscript s,superscript T] between mature (59 years since fire) and intermediate aged (32 years since fire) scars that were both subjected to fire in 2007 (P = 0.226). Furthermore, there was no difference in mean F[subscript s,superscript T] between mature (59 years since fire) and young scars (16 years since fire) that were both subjected to fire in 2007 (P = 0.186). There was an increase in F[subscript s,superscript T] with time since fire for the chronosequence 0, 16 and 59 years post fire (P < 0.001). Our results lead us to hypothesise that the autotrophic:heterotrophic soil respiration ratio increases over post-fire successional time in boreal jack pine systems, though this should be explored in future research.
