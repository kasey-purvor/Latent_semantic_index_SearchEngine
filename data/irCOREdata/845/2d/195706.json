Ionosphere (Auroral ionosphere; Plasma con-\nvection) \u2013 Magnetospheric physics (Storms and substorms)\nCorrespondence to: A. Grocott\n(a.grocott@ion.le.ac.uk)\n1 Introduction\nMagnetospheric substorms are understood to be one of the\nprimary mechanisms by which the Earth\u2019s magnetotail rids\nitself of stored magnetic flux and energy that are accumu-\nlated through the action of reconnection with the interplane-\ntary magnetic field. Whilst the exact time sequence of events\nwhich surrounds the onset of magnetospheric substorms is\nstill under debate, it has recently been suggested that sub-\nstorms are initiated by near-Earth reconnection in the magne-\ntotail (Angelopoulos et al., 2008), which pinches off closed\nmagnetic flux and then closes open magnetic flux, exciting\nmagnetospheric convection (e.g. Baker et al., 1996). Within\na few minutes a disruption of the cross-tail current is also ob-\nserved in the inner magnetosphere, leading to the creation of\nthe substorm current wedge (e.g. Lui, 1996) and an associ-\nated ionospheric auroral disturbance (Akasofu, 1964). There\nhave been mixed reports, however, regarding the nature of the\nionospheric convection that accompanies this disturbance.\nWe address this issue in the present paper.\nIt was suggested by Cowley et al. (1998) that reconnec-\ntion during substorms should excite large-scale twin-vortex\nflow in the high-latitude ionosphere. In an early study of\nSondrestrom radar data, Blanchard et al. (1997) found that\nan increase in the tail reconnection rate occurs near midnight\nshortly after substorm expansion phase onset. Initially, how-\never, this increase was mainly manifest in a poleward mo-\ntion of the inferred open-closed field line boundary with the\nflows becoming elevated only after an interval of \u223c30 min.\nSomewhat correspondingly, Weimer (1999) presented a sta-\ntistical survey of low-altitude electric field data from the DE-\n2 spacecraft, separated according to the IMF direction and\ninto substorm and non-substorm intervals. The flow patterns\nfor a given IMF orientation showed a more pronounced \u201cHa-\nrang\u201d asymmetry on the nightside during substorm intervals\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n592 A. Grocott et al.: Ionospheric convection during substorms\nFig. 1. The locations of Northern Hemisphere isolated substorm on-\nsets, observed by the FUV instrument on-board the IMAGE satel-\nlite, presented in magnetic latitude \u2013 magnetic local time coordi-\nnates. The occurrence of substorms within each latitude \u2013 local\ntime bin is colour coded according to the scale at the bottom.\nthan during non-substorm intervals, but the total transpolar\nvoltage values showed little overall difference. On the other\nhand, Opgenoorth and Pellinen (1998) presented evidence\nfor flow enhancements in the dusk auroral zone immediately\nfollowing expansion phase onset in the midnight sector, lead-\ning to an immediate increase in the global \u201cdirectly driven\u201d\ncurrent system. They suggest, however, that diversion of the\ntwin-vortex flow around the low-flow high-conductivity au-\nroral bulge formed during the expansion phase (e.g. Morelli\net al., 1995; Yeoman et al., 2000) may play a role. More\nrecently, Grocott et al. (2002) presented an analysis of Su-\nper Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) flow data\nobtained during an isolated substorm, and found evidence\nfor the excitation of twin-vortex flow cells centred in the\nnightside ionosphere, which enhance the transpolar voltage\nby \u223c40 kV compared with pre-onset values. Further studies\nusing SuperDARN have produced mixed results, however,\nby providing evidence for both the excitation (e.g. Grocott\net al., 2006; Provan et al., 2004) and reduction (e.g. Lyons\net al., 2001; Bristow and Jensen, 2007) of the flows follow-\ning substorm onset.\nUsing the Frey et al. (2004) substorm database Milan et al.\n(2009) performed a superposed epoch analysis of the auroral\nevolution of substorms. They found that the auroral mor-\nphology was only reproducible in an average sense if sub-\nstorms were grouped according to onset magnetic latitude,\ndue largely to the fact that substorm intensity is intrinsically\nlinked to the pre-existing open flux content of the polar cap.\nIn the present paper we therefore use a similar latitude group-\ning to produce a set of average substorm convection patterns\nfor each onset-latitude group. These patterns are obtained for\nthe interval from 60 min before, to 90 min after, each of the\n1979 isolated Northern Hemisphere substorms in the Frey\nlist, using the radar data set discussed by Wild and Grocott\n(2008). We find that there is a clear difference in the iono-\nspheric convection response to substorms of differing onset\nlatitudes. Higher-latitude substorms are associated with a\nsignificant and prompt increase in the nightside convection\nfollowing onset, whereas lower-latitude substorms appear to\nbe associated with an initial decrease in the nightside flows,\nwith a delay of up to \u223c60 min before any enhancement is\nobserved.\n2 Data analysis\nUsing the FUV instrument (Mende et al., 2000a,b) on the IM-\nAGE spacecraft Frey et al. (2004) identified 2437 substorms\noccurring between May 2000 and December 2002, subse-\nquently extending this number to 4193 after considering the\n5-year period up to December 2005. Wild and Grocott (2008)\nrefined this list to 3005 isolated events (by excluding those\nknown to have occurred within \u00b12 h of another substorm),\n1979 of which were observed in the Northern Hemisphere.\nThe onset locations of these 1979 events (see Fig. 1) have\na mean magnetic latitude of 66\u25e6 and a mean magnetic local\ntime (MLT) of 23 h. For the purposes of the present study we\nhave grouped these events into 10 magnetic latitude bins: be-\nlow 61\u25e6, 61\u201362\u25e6. . . , 68\u201369\u25e6, and above 69\u25e6. For each event\nwe define a \u201csubstorm epoch\u201d as being an interval of time\nrunning from 60 min before, to 90 min after, the onset time\nof the substorm.\nIonospheric flow data for each substorm epoch are pro-\nvided by the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (Super-\nDARN). The SuperDARN network of HF radars provides\nalmost continuous measurements of ionospheric convection\nvelocities in the auroral regions of the Northern and Southern\nHemispheres (Greenwald et al., 1995; Chisham et al., 2007)\nand this facilitates the routine production of large scale maps\nof the high-latitude convection using the \u201cMap Potential\u201d\ntechnique (Ruohoniemi and Baker, 1998). This technique\ninvolves the mapping of line-of-sight radar velocity measure-\nments onto an equal area polar grid and using them to derive\na best-fit solution to an nth-order expansion of the electro-\nstatic potential, expressed in spherical harmonics. An inves-\ntigation into the sensitivity of the choice of n on the results\nof the present study revealed that a relatively low sixth order\nexpansion was suitable for resolving the larger-scale charac-\nter of the convection pattern. A boundary defining the zero\npotential at the equatorward edge of the convection pattern\nis also determined from the radar data to help constrain the\nsolution at lower latitudes.\nTwo methods of investigating the average substorm con-\nvection have been adopted for this study. The first method\nprovides a means by which we can investigate the best-fit av-\nerage large-scale convection patterns and involves using the\nAnn.

Grocott et al.: Ionospheric convection during substorms 593\nMap Potential \u201cgridded\u201d radar data files generated by Wild\nand Grocott (2008) to derive superposed epoch convection\npatterns for the ten onset-latitude bins. This is achieved by\ncombining the gridded radar data from all of the substorm\nepochs in each of the ten onset-latitude bins into ten super-\nposed substorm epochs and then performing the Map Poten-\ntial fit on each one. The maximum number of substorms in\nany one onset-latitude bin is 305, however, owing to data\nprocessing limitations we restricted the number of substorm\nepochs combined in any one Map Potential fit to 150. Where\nan onset-latitude bin contained more than 150 substorms a\nrandom sample of 150 was used. Having performed the anal-\nysis on a number of different random samples we can confirm\nthat little difference is evident in the large-scale nature of the\npatterns.\nIt is also necessary to manually specify the magnetic lat-\nitude of the zero-potential boundary, 30, for these average\nconvection maps. In the Map Potential analysis, this bound-\nary is set to be the lowest latitude at which a significant\nnumber of flow vectors above a specified velocity threshold\nare observed. For the usual \u201cindividual-epoch\u201d analysis this\nis usually set to be 3 flow vectors above 100 m s\u22121, which\nis generally sufficient to exclude any noise and interference\nwhich might otherwise mislead the algorithm and force it to\nset the boundary too low. When adding such a large volume\nof radar data together however, as is the case for the super-\nposed epoch analysis, this technique generally fails. We have\ntherefore specified the boundary to be the mean of the bound-\naries identified at each time step for all of the individual sub-\nstorm epochs. Whilst this might not necessarily be the best\nchoice in each individual case, it is an objective and con-\nsistent method across all times and onset-latitude bins and\nmakes direct comparisons between different convection pat-\nterns straightforward.\nThe second method we have used to investigate the aver-\nage convection involves using a statistical database of iono-\nspheric convection data to study the average nightside flows\nin a more localised manner. This database has been created\nto facilitate studies involving large volumes of SuperDARN\ndata and consists of a reduced set of 40 velocity measure-\nments (and associated data coverage information) for every\n2 min interval between 1999 and 2006. These measurements\nare derived for the centre points of a set of boxes, the loca-\ntions of which are fixed in magnetic local time but are scaled\nin magnetic latitude according to the overall size of the con-\nvection pattern, as shown in Fig. 2. In other words, the lowest\nlatitude boxes are located just poleward of the zero-potential\nboundary of the convection pattern, 30, (the green curve in\nFig. 2), with a further three sets of boxes at latitudes evenly\ndistributed between the first set and the pole. By fixing the\nlatitude of these boxes relative to30, similar statistical points\ncorrespond to the same region of the convection pattern in\neach case rather than simply the same magnetic latitude\/local\ntime. The boxes themselves delimit the area in which \u201clo-\ncal\u201d data coverage is defined. In the present study we have\nFig. 2.

This does mean that the number of events contributing\nto the velocity averages is not the same for each time step\n(overall it results in between 30% and 50% of the substorms\nbeing included in the averaging for each onset-latitude bin)\nbut it ensures that the velocity averages from each substorm\ncorrespond to regions of the convection patterns where radar\ndata were present to constrain the fitting.

The vertical dotted lines\nindicate the time of substorm onset in the superposed-epoch and\nthe dashed lines highlight times which are referred to in the text.\nOn the right-hand side of panel (a) the number of substorms that\ncontributed to the global convection analysis for each onset-latitude\nbin is shown.\nenhancements are evident in the midnight sector at \u223c70\u25e6\nfor both onset-latitude bins, although globally there is little\nappreciable change, as indicated by VPC . A few minutes\nlater, however, a significant reduction of the nightside flows\nis readily apparent at this location for the low-latitude sub-\nstorms (i,d). By comparison, (ii,d) reveals a modest en-\nhancement in the convection over pre-onset levels for the\nhigher-latitude substorms. By 20 min into the substorm ex-\npansion phase (e) the midnight-sector flows associated with\nthe lower-latitude substorms have recovered somewhat (i,e),\nalthough VPC is still less than that during the growth phase\n(62 kV vs. 69 kV). The value of VPC associated with the\nhigher-latitude substorms (ii,e) also shows a modest increase\n(to 46 kV), as do the nightside flows at \u223c70\u25e6. These trends\ncontinue through the expansion phase to 50 min after onset\n(f) by which time VPC has decreased further for the lower\nonset-latitude bin and increased for the higher-latitude bin.\nLocally, the midnight-sector flows still appear strong for both\nonset-latitude bins.\nThe results described above show that the ionospheric\nflows change in response to the substorm cycle. Whilst the\nevolution of the flows appears to be quite complex it is quite\napparent that a difference exists between substorms of differ-\nent onset latitude. To study their time-evolution more eas-\nily, Fig. 4 presents an overview of (a) the transpolar volt-\nage, VPC , and (b) the magnetic latitude of the zero-potential\nboundary, 30, derived from the superposed-epoch convec-\ntion patterns. In each case, data from the ten onset-latitude\nbins (vertical axis) are plotted versus substorm epoch-time,\nrelative to substorm onset (vertical dotted line). The num-\nber of substorms that contributed to the global convection\nanalysis for each onset-latitude bin is shown on the right-\nhand side of panel (a) (where 150 was an imposed maxi-\nmum, as described in Sect. 2). It is clear from (a) that in gen-\neral the convection becomes enhanced by \u223c20 kV, \u223c20 min\nprior to substorm onset (first vertical dashed line). For\nthe higher-latitude substorms (onset-latitudes above \u223c65\u25e6)\nthis enhancement persists throughout the expansion phase\nwith little evidence of any subsequent reduction. For the\nlower-latitude substorms (onset-latitudes below \u223c65\u25e6) there\nis some evidence of a reduction after \u223c30 min (second ver-\ntical dashed line) to pre-growth phase levels. There is also\nsome evidence of a discontinuity between the voltage values\nin the lowest two onset-latitude bins. This is likely to be a\nresult of the lowest bin containing substorms that initiated at\nlatitudes lower than 60\u25e6. Later on in the expansion\/recovery\nphase a number of smaller enhancements appear to occur,\nwhich could be associated with further reconnection events\nsuch as poleward boundary intensifications which are known\nto occur during the substorm recovery phase (Lyons et al.,\n1998). Overall, however, there is no clear pattern to the evo-\nlution of VPC during the expansion phase beyond \u223c30 min.\nIn panel (b) the average latitude, 30, of the zero-potential\nboundary of the convection patterns is shown for each onset-\nlatitude bin, to give an indication of the variation in the size\nof the polar cap. In addition, curves are superposed to more\nclearly illustrate the (relative) variation in boundary-latitude\nfor 3 selected onset-latitude bins: under 60\u25e6 (lower), 64\u25e6\u2013\n65\u25e6 (middle), and over 69\u25e6 (upper). The scale for these\ncurves is such that 1\u25e6 on the vertical axis corresponds to a 2\u25e6\nchange in boundary-latitude. The relationship between po-\nlar cap size and onset latitude that is implied by the variation\nin 30 is very pronounced, with approximately 5\u25e6 variation\n(blues through to oranges) over the 10\u25e6 of the different onset-\nlatitude bins. The variation in convection pattern size over\nthe 90 min of the superposed-epochs is much less (of the or-\nder of 2\u25e6), but still clearly shows an expansion of the convec-\ntion pattern during the growth and early expansion phases,\nfollowed by a contraction of the pattern during the late ex-\npansion and recovery phases. These are the variations that\nare predicted by the expanding-contacting polar cap (ECPC)\nparadigm, which explains how variable rates of dayside and\nAnn.

Figure 4b therefore illus-\ntrates that dayside reconnection dominates during the sub-\nstorm growth phase, resulting in the expansion of the polar\ncap, but that during the substorm expansion phase it is night-\nside reconnection which dominates, resulting in a net closure\nof open flux and the observed decrease in size of the polar\ncap.\nThis concept provides a possible explanation for the lack\nof any significant change in VPC during the expansion phase,\ndiscussed above. VPC is determined by both the dayside and\nnightside reconnection rates such that, for example, if an in-\nterval dominated by dayside reconnection driven flows was\nfollowed by an interval dominated by nightside reconnec-\ntion driven flows, there is no requirement for VPC to change.\nSpikes in the reconnection rates, such as those which might\nbe produced by variable reconnection as suggested above,\nwill be manifest in VPC , but a change of dominance from\ndayside to nightside reconnection will not. It is perhaps more\nhelpful, therefore, to look locally at the flows on the nightside\nwhich might be more directly related to nightside reconnec-\ntion.\n3.2 Small-scale flows\nFigure 5 presents flow data obtained from the statistical con-\nvection database described in Sect. 2, from four of the box\nlocations shown in Fig. 2 (32, 23, 21, and 11). These were\nchosen because they encompass the bulk of the substorm on-\nset locations, as can be seen by comparison with Fig. 1. The\nmagnitude of the average flow measurements for each of the\nten onset-latitude bins is presented, in a similar format to\nFig. 4. Again, the vertical dotted line on each panel indi-\ncates the time of substorm onset; the dashed lines are dis-\ncussed below. Additionally, on the right-hand side of each\npanel, the mean number of substorms that contributed to the\nstatistics for each onset-latitude bin is shown. As discussed\nin Sect. 2 this number is not constant over the 150 min of\nthe superposed-epoch, however, an inspection of the vari-\nation suggests little deviation from this mean. The advan-\ntage of allowing this number to vary is that the flow averages\npresented are derived only from intervals where radar data\nwere present at the location of the box. As will be discussed\nbelow, these localised flow measurements appear to exhibit\nmore variability than the transpolar voltage over the evolu-\ntion of the substorm, as well as reinforcing the onset-latitude\ndependence which was previously noted.\nConsider the top-left panel, which shows flow data from\nstatistical box 32. Approximately 20 min prior to substorm\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/591\/2009\/ Ann. Geophys., 27, 591\u2013600, 2009\n598 A. Grocott et al.: Ionospheric convection during substorms\nFig. 6. 10-min averages of WIC auroral electron counts, plotted for the same locations as the flow data in Fig. 5 as a function of time relative\nto substorm onset, for five onset-latitude bins. The dotted and dashed lines are as in Fig. 5 (after Milan et al., 2009).\nonset an enhancement can be seen in the flows, most obvious\nin the highest four and lowest two onset-latitude bins, which\nis similar to the growth phase enhancement of VPC seen in\nFig. 4. Around the time of onset, further changes are evident\nin the data. For onset-latitudes above 68\u25e6 there is an enhance-\nment in the flows from \u223c200 m s\u22121 to \u223c250 m s\u22121, whereas\nbelow 67\u25e6 there is a reduction of about the same magnitude.\nThe duration of this reduction, however, appears to be related\nto the onset-latitude, with a subsequent enhancement occur-\nring \u223c15 min after onset for the 67\u25e6\u201368\u25e6 bin, but not for a\nfurther \u223c15 min for the 62\u25e6\u201363\u25e6 bin. This is suggestive of\na relationship between the onset-latitude and the duration of\nthe post-onset flow reduction, discussed further below.\nA similar but somewhat less clear pattern can be seen in\nthe data from statistical box 23 (top-right), although any re-\nlationship in this case is not as obvious. The data from both\nof the lower-latitude statistical boxes (21 and 11, bottom pan-\nels), however, clearly reinforce the idea of a relationship be-\ntween onset-latitude and the duration of a flow reduction dur-\ning the early substorm expansion phase. In both cases this re-\nlationship appears to be linear, as indicated by the dashed di-\nagonal lines. Consider first the data from magnetic local mid-\nnight (box 11). For the lowest onset-latitude bins the growth\nphase flows of up to 300 m s\u22121 are reduced dramatically at\nsubstorm onset, dropping to under 100 m s\u22121 by 10 to 20 min\ninto the expansion phase. For higher onset-latitudes (above\n66\u25e6), however, the magnitude of the growth phase flows is\nless. In this case, rather than decreasing at onset, the flows\nexhibit little immediate change but then proceed to increase\nfrom \u223c150 m s\u22121 to \u223c250 m s\u22121 after \u223c10 min. Looking\nagain at the lower onset-latitude bins, this post-onset flow\nenhancement can also be seen to occur, but after a delay\nwhich appears to be approximately inversely proportional to\nthe latitude of the onset (\u223c5 min per degree, as indicated by\nthe dashed slope). For the lowest onset-latitude bin this en-\nhancement is therefore not evident until \u223c60 min after on-\nset. Finally, turning to the data in box 21 (a location \u223c1.5 h\nwest of box 11), a similar pattern is evident in the flows.\nHere the delay is somewhat more prolonged, certainly for\nhigher onset-latitudes where it is \u223c30 min longer, although\nfor onset-latitudes below \u223c64\u25e6 there is some evidence of a\nthreshold to this delay of \u223c60\u201370 min where this linear rela-\ntionship breaks down.\n3.3 Substorm auroral evolution\nAs discussed in Sect. 1, it has previously been suggested that\nthe ionospheric convection during substorms is related to the\nassociated auroral development. In this section we therefore\nbriefly consider the auroral development as a possible expla-\nnation for the delayed convection response described above.\nIn Fig. 6 we show data based on the work of Milan et al.\n(2009) that was derived from a subset of the Frey et al. (2004)\nlist of substorms, similar to the subset used in the present\nstudy. Auroral electron counts from the Wideband Imag-\ning Camera (WIC) on the IMAGE spacecraft are presented\nas a function of substorm epoch-time, for a range of onset\nlatitudes, for the same set of locations discussed in Fig. 5.\nThe onset time is again marked with the vertical dotted line\nAnn.

Grocott et al.: Ionospheric convection during substorms 599\nin each panel, and the dashed lines from Fig. 5 are also re-\nproduced for comparison. The bottom two panels clearly il-\nlustrate that there is a strong dependence of substorm auro-\nral intensity on onset latitude, with the lowest onset-latitude\nsubstorms having the brightest expansion phase aurora. It is\nalso evident that the lowest onset-latitude substorms have the\nlongest duration expansion phase, with the time taken for the\ninitial peak in intensity to return to some lower threshold be-\ning dependent on the onset-latitude. The dashed lines from\nFig. 5 are therefore quite well correlated with the auroral in-\ntensity drop, suggesting a relationship between the duration\nof the auroral brightening and the duration of the flow re-\nduction. The upper two panels, being representative of the\nauroral intensity more poleward of the main auroral bulge,\nreveal an initial delay, after onset, before the peak count is\nobserved. This is presumably indicative of the finite propa-\ngation time of the poleward expansion of the auroral bulge.\nThe peak auroral intensities at these more poleward locations\nare also lower, which could explain why there was a less ob-\nvious pattern to the evolution of the flows at these higher\nlatitudes. Overall, these results then demonstrate that, in an\naverage sense, the flow stagnation associated with substorms\ndepends on the strength and duration of the expansion phase\naurora and associated conductivity enhancement.\n4 Summary\nThe results discussed above reaffirm the fact that magne-\ntospheric substorms have a measurable influence on iono-\nspheric convection. Furthermore they show for the first time\nthat substorms with different onset latitudes have strikingly\ndifferent convection characteristics. Low onset-latitude sub-\nstorms, below \u223c64\u25e6, are generally of larger intensity and are\nassociated with intervals of stronger convection, but more no-\nticeably appear to result in a reduction of the flow immedi-\nately after onset. This reduction is usually attributed to en-\nhanced conductivities in the midnight sector which dominate\nduring large substorms and are associated with higher levels\nof auroral activity (Morelli et al., 1995; Yeoman et al., 2000;\nMilan et al., 2009). Mid-latitude substorms, between \u223c64\u25e6\nand \u223c66\u25e6, are less noticeably associated with a large-scale\nreduction in convection, but equally, do not produce such\nan immediate and remarkable enhancement in the nightside\nflows. High-latitude substorms, above \u223c66\u25e6, are associated\nwith the smallest, but most persistent, large-scale convec-\ntion response to substorms, and produce the most immedi-\nate enhancement to the flow in the locally disturbed region.\nThis suggests that higher onset-latitude substorms, during\nwhich there is a relatively low auroral conductivity enhance-\nment, are dominated by the local electric field, whereas lower\nonset-latitude substorms are dominated by high conductivi-\nties which result in a suppression of the convection electric\nfield, and consequently, the ionospheric flows. In addition\nto the onset-latitude dependence of the convection reported\nhere, one would also expect there to be an observable onset-\nMLT dependence. This would introduce further complexity\nto the nature of the convection which is not revealed by the\npresent study. Further work, currently in progress, will inves-\ntigate the MLT dependence as well as any relationship to the\neffects of the BY -component of the interplanetary magnetic\nfield.\nAcknowledgements.
