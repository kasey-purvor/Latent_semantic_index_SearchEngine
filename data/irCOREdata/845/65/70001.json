Moreover, he\nasserted that such scholars had operated as a \u201csupport team\u201d for Aum\nShinriky\u00f4 in its activities. Takimoto\u2019s criticisms were directed most\nparticularly at Shimada Hiromi and Nakazawa Shin\u2019ichi, two Japanese\nscholars of religion who had made positive statements about Aum prior\nto the Tokyo subway attack of March 1995 that brought Aum to\ninternational notice. They had, Takimoto claimed, failed to produce an\naccurate analysis (by which Takimoto meant a critical and condemnatory\naccount) of the movement. Instead they had whitewashed it, thereby\ncontributing to Aum\u2019s criminality and subjecting many people in Aum\nto what Takimoto called \u201cmind control.\u201d2 It was not only Japanese scholars\nof religion who came under fire, however, for although Takimoto did\nnot state it in so many words, the activities of a group of scholars who\nvisited Japan from the U.S. soon after the subway attack also received\nimmense criticism in Japan.\nTakimoto was not a detached observer of the Aum affair, for he had\nfor some time prior to the subway attack been a prominent campaigner\nagainst Aum Shinriky\u00f4, acting as an advocate for the parents of young\npeople who had severed family relationships and joined Aum\u2019s\ncommunes. He also organized support groups whose aim was to persuade\nAum members to defect and to renounce their faith, and he repeatedly\nissued criticisms in the press about Aum, reserving particular scorn for\nits leader and founder Asahara Sh\u00f4k\u00f4 and his claims to have acquired\nthe power of levitation through his ascetic practices.3 Takimoto publicly\nridiculed such claims by publishing photographs of himself leaping in\nthe air as if levitating, thereby suggesting that Asahara\u2019s levitation was\nnothing but a fraud.4\n   369\nReader:  Aum Shinriky\u00f4 and Academic Integrity\nTakimoto\u2019s attitude towards, and charges against, Aum were not\ndissimilar to those voiced against other NRMs by \u201canti-cult\u201d campaigners\nin other parts of the world. In his attacks on Aum one finds the usual\nroster of charges, from trickery, manipulation, financial abuse, and\nsnatching \u201cchildren\u201d (usually of adult age) from their parents, to\nbrainwashing, mind control, and sundry criminal activities. However,\nwhat gave Takimoto\u2019s campaign against Aum a particular resonance\nwas that it was driven by his belief that the movement had been involved\nin the disappearance of another lawyer, Sakamoto Tsutsumi, along with\nhis wife and child, in November 1989. At the time, Sakamoto had been\nprominent in a campaign against Aum and was acting as the legal\nrepresentative for a number of people, including families who had\nvoiced complaints after their sons and daughters had joined Aum.\nTakimoto\u2019s suspicions on this score were proven correct in September\n1995, when senior Aum members arrested after the sarin attack\nconfessed that they had killed the Sakamoto family on Asahara\u2019s orders\nand disposed of the bodies. Takimoto had in many respects taken over\nSakamoto\u2019s anti-Aum campaign after his disappearance. He also had\nreason to fear for his own life in the months prior to the Tokyo sarin\nattack  and had been put under police protection in November 1994\nbecause of concerns that the movement harbored aggressive intentions\ntowards him. Indeed, as various accounts of the Aum affair have shown,\nby this time the movement had become locked into an escalating cycle\nof violence directed at external enemies and at suspected defectors.\nEventually this violence claimed at least twenty-five lives outside the\nmovement (as well as numerous deaths within it), culminating in the\nsubway attack and other atrocities in the spring of 1995.5\nTakimoto was therefore not a detached observer of events, and\nhis criticisms of scholars of religion were by no means impartial.\nNonetheless, they broadly reflected the public mood in Japan after\nthe full horror of the Aum affair had come to light in 1995, and they\nparticularly illustrate how the integrity of scholars of religion came\nto be publicly questioned in its aftermath. This public questioning\nand criticism, albeit from highly partial sources, is important for a\nnumber of reasons. While it demonstrates a misunderstanding of\nthe role of scholars of religion (who, Takimoto clearly thinks, should\ncriticize rather than analyze NRMs), it brings to light the problems\nthat arise when scholars of religion are perceived by the public to\nbe sympathetic to movements that are in conflict with mainstream\nsociety. Indeed, Takimoto\u2019s criticisms go right to the heart of the\nissues raised in a recent symposium in Nova Religio (Nova Religio 2,\nno. 1 [1998] ) that examined questions of academic integrity in the\nstudy of NRMs. One of the issues that was highlighted in the\nsymposium related to the problems that arise when scholars appear\nto get too close to the movements they study. For example, by accepting\n370\nNova Religio\na NRM\u2019s hospitality or making public statements of support, scholars\nopen themselves to charges of partiality.\nDespite the polemical ways in which they have been expressed,\nTakimoto\u2019s criticisms are of interest because they illustrate that the types\nof discussions, debates, and polarities indicated by the various articles\nin that edition of Nova Religio are, like the incidence of cult controversies\nthemselves, not confined to the Western world. They are also the subject\nof major debate in non-Western countries such as Japan. Takimoto\u2019s\ncomments alert us further to the ways in which the activities of scholars\ncan at times inadvertently compromise not only their own position but\nalso that of their colleagues in the field. As such it is worth exploring\nthe background to these criticisms for the lessons the Aum case has for\nthose who study new religions in any part of the world.\nAUM AND SCHOLASTIC MISADVENTURES\nAum Shinriky\u00f4 had, for a number of years prior to March 1995,\nreceived very critical press coverage in Japan. It had been widely accused\nof civil rights violations and infringements of Japanese law, and was\nsuspected of involvement in the disappearance of noted opponents of\nthe movement. Although all these charges have subsequently proven\nto be accurate, the movement adamantly denied them, aggressively\ndismissing any accusation against it as religious persecution and as the\nproduct of a corrupt media.6 In its counter-offensive against the media,\nAum gained the support of academics as well as public personalities.\nAsahara gave interviews to a small number of Japanese scholars and\ntelevision personalities in the early 1990s, winning them over with his\ncharm and impressing them with the strength of his convictions and\nthe dedication of his followers. The fact that Aum\u2019s followers engaged\nin strict ascetic disciplines of a level rarely found in modern Japan\nimpressed some observers and convinced them that Aum was a benign\nand sincere religious movement. As a result, Aum was able to use the\nsupportive comments of scholars such as Nakazawa Shin\u2019ichi, a specialist\nin Tibetan Buddhism who had met Asahara on occasion, to counteract\ncritical media reports.7\nAnother scholar who developed contacts with Aum was Shimada\nHiromi, a professor at Nihon Women\u2019s University in Tokyo. Shimada,\nwho specialized in the study of modern Japanese religion, wrote widely\nabout the types of religious groups that attracted contemporary Japanese\nyouth and paid particular attention to Aum. In these writings he\ncompared Aum favorably with some other new religions and in\nparticular with K\u00f4fuku no Kagaku, a similarly Buddhist-oriented new\nreligion established in 1986. K\u00f4fuku no Kagaku had been involved in\nvarious conflicts with Aum and was regarded as a bitter rival. Shimada\n   371\nReader:  Aum Shinriky\u00f4 and Academic Integrity\ncontrasted the austerities performed by Aum members and the levels of\nknowledge of Buddhism they appeared to have with what he saw as the\nlack of ascetic practice and a weaker understanding of Buddhism among\nfollowers of K\u00f4fuku no Kagaku. His work, in effect, favored Aum.8\nMoreover, he encouraged some of his seminar students to conduct\nfieldwork at Aum centers, met Asahara on a number of occasions, and\nallowed photographs to be taken of himself smiling alongside Aum\u2019s\nleader. These were used by the movement\u2014as were similar photographs\nof Asahara with Nakazawa and various religious leaders such as the Dalai\nLama\u2014as proof of its legitimacy. Shimada\u2019s public support was also used\nby Aum in publications aimed at raising the movement\u2019s profile and\nprestige.\nIn January 1995, when hints were made in the Japanese press that\nAum had been responsible for a sarin gas attack in the town of Matsumoto\nin June 1994 and that one of the buildings at its commune might house\na laboratory for making chemical weapons, the movement invited\nShimada to inspect the facility. He did so, proclaiming that it was in fact\na temple whose sole purpose was for worship. Shown a newly constructed\nstatue and told that behind it was a temple open only to initiates, he had\nnot demanded access but had posed by the statue for photographs.\nBesides giving the movement a public endorsement, he hinted that\nanother group might have been responsible for the earlier Matsumoto\npoison attack.9 Shimada was wrong\u2014it was later revealed that the statue\nhad been hastily constructed and placed there to conceal the entrance\nto the laboratory which was used to make Aum\u2019s chemical weapons. He\nhad committed the arch folly of trusting in the sincerity of his informants\nand believing that his guides were telling him the unvarnished truth. As\na result of this incident Takimoto later accused Shimada of \u201cnot even\ntrying to know\u201d what was going on in Aum.10\nAfter the sarin attack, Shimada appeared on television programs\ndiscussing the Aum affair and was widely criticized as a defender of the\nmovement. Eventually, he came under pressure from his own university\nand was forced to resign his position. Shimada has since responded to\nthese criticisms by admitting some errors of judgment, criticizing other\nscholars in Japan for their failures in the affair, and claiming that he\nhad been deceived by Aum and hence was something of a victim himself.11\nThe apparent complicity, at least in the public mind, of Shimada\nand Nakazawa with Aum was damaging to the general reputation of\nscholars of religion in Japan. This problem was further compounded\nwhen two scholars of NRMs, accompanied by a scientist and a human\nrights lawyer\u2014all four American\u2014visited Japan in April 1995 at Aum\u2019s\ninvitation and expense. At the time, Aum was protesting the charges\nleveled against it and claiming this was yet another part of a massive\nconspiracy against the movement that involved the Japanese and U.S.\ngovernments, the Japanese Imperial family, the Freemasons, the Jews,\n372\nNova Religio\nand numerous other groups and individuals.12 Besieged by the authorities\nand with hundreds of its members being arrested and held without\ncharge, Aum appealed for help to the Association of World Academics\nfor Religious Education (AWARE), an American organization established\n\u201cto serve as a kind of religious Amnesty International.\u201d13\nAWARE\u2019s founder, James R. Lewis, was one of the group that visited\nJapan under the association\u2019s auspices. The visit was well-intentioned,\nand the participants were genuinely concerned about possible violations\nof civil rights in the wake of the extensive police investigations and\ndetentions of followers. At the time, while there was widespread public\ncertainty about Aum\u2019s guilt in the subway attack and other crimes, there\nwas no absolute proof, and Aum\u2019s vociferous protestations of innocence\nmight have suggested to an outsider that it had been set up. The visit,\nhowever, had the unfortunate effect of simply reinforcing the public\nview that scholars of religion were na\u00efve support teams for dangerous\nreligious groups.14\nMoreover, the scholars\u2019 defense of a movement that had been linked\nto a number of terrible crimes offended Japanese sensibilities and\nsuggested a lack of judgment on the part of the visitors. The public was\nconcerned about its safety, and yet\u2014so it appeared to many Japanese\u2014\nthe Americans had come to protest possible violations of the civil rights\nof a movement that had committed mass murder.15\nJ. Gordon Melton, one of the NRM specialists involved, shortly\nafterwards concluded that Aum had in fact been involved in the attack\nand other crimes.16 Lewis, however, was clearly impressed by his hosts\nand their allegations of conspiracy. He went so far as to publish an article\nthat suggested that the Aum affair was \u201cJapan\u2019s Waco,\u201d an attempt by\nthe authorities to crush a problematic religious movement. In suggesting\nthat Aum had been framed, Lewis outlined his hypothesis that it \u201cwas\nbeing made to play the role of scapegoat for the incompetence of the\nauthorities at the highest levels of the Japanese government.\u201d17\nLewis\u2019s misjudgment and the scholars\u2019 ill-fated visit compounded\nthe mistakes that had been made by Japanese specialists in the field.\nThey appeared to further reinforce the impression that scholars of\nreligion lacked critical judgment or, indeed, any real knowledge of the\nsubject about which they were speaking. As Watanabe Manabu, a noted\nscholar of Aum, commented, the scholars from outside Japan \u201chad no\nprior knowledge of the Aum Affair, nor of the incidents prior to the\nTokyo sarin gas attack.\u201d18 According to Watanabe, the visit, along with\nthe Shimada affair,\nserved to make scholars of religion look like credulous fools, a negative image\nreinforced by the mass media and anti-cult activists who have portrayed the\nscholars as persons insensitive and na\u00efve to the dangers of \u201cdestructive cults.\u201d\nThus it is no wonder that scholars of religion consider the Aum Affair as a crisis\nfor religious studies at large.19\n   373\nReader:  Aum Shinriky\u00f4 and Academic Integrity\nMISUNDERSTANDINGS AND METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS\nWhy, one should ask, were such basic mistakes made in this matter?\nHow did scholars give an apparent seal of approval and a clean bill of\nhealth to a movement that had committed a number of appalling\ncrimes? While space does not allow for a detailed and thorough analysis\nof the reasons why a number of scholars from different backgrounds\nwere misled by Aum, I think that one point needs to be stressed. This is\nthat none of those who appeared to speak up for Aum had sufficient\nknowledge of the movement at its grassroots to gain a thorough\nrecognition of how the movement functioned. Without close and\nlengthy contact with its members, time spent in its commune observing\nday to day life, or discussions with former members, they were unable\nto see beyond the surface veneer that Aum presented to the outside\nworld. They were speaking from superficial knowledge gleaned from\nstage-managed interactions and contacts with specific highly-placed\nfigures in Aum\u2019s hierarchy\u2014precisely the people who were involved in\nAum\u2019s criminality and cover-up.\nThis is where the importance of fieldwork needs to be stressed along\nwith the shortcomings of scholarly attempts to deal with large numbers\nof NRMs. General overviews tend to create a mind-set in which all NRMs\nare seen in a similar light and their problems as universal. Put another\nway, they create the assumption that if some new religions are being\nharassed or oppressed, then any new religion might be. In a sense, this\nparallels the assumptions made by anti-cultists that if one NRM commits\ncrimes or indiscretions, then all do. It is equally fallacious, of course, to\nassume that just because one new religion may be falsely accused of\natrocities then all new religions suspected of criminal behavior must be\nfalsely accused.\nIn the case of Japanese scholars the tendency has been to study new\nreligions through a range of general contacts with high-ranking\nmovement officials. Conversely, they have focused far less on intensive\nfieldwork and close observations of a particular group, or on gaining\nknowledge of a specific movement by living for lengthy periods with its\nmembers. This situation has arisen partly because of the small number\nof specialists of new religions in Japan relative to the large number of\nmovements that are active there. On that score alone it is perhaps more\nstriking that some scholars had at least looked at Aum than that none of\nthem had done any in-depth studies of the movement.\nThe situation is also a product of the Japanese academic system,\nwhich rarely provides the opportunity for scholars to spend long periods\nof time conducting fieldwork. This in turn means that contacts tend to\nbe transitory and located at the upper echelons of movements. Scholars\n374\nNova Religio\nwho looked at Aum encountered senior officials skilled in handling\noutsiders or were introduced to Asahara, who met them under\ncontrolled circumstances in which he was at his most charming.20 While\nsuch an approach allows scholars to have a broad knowledge of a number\nof movements and to develop some overviews of the field in general, it\nis too \u201ctop down\u201d in focus to probe adequately the inner dynamics of\nsuch movements. Nor, of course, does it provide the opportunities or\neven the skills to look beyond the picture that is presented to scholars\nby the movements in question. Looking at the upper echelons and\ntalking to the senior figures in a movement without longer-term\nobservations and close contacts with the ordinary members, as the Aum\ncase shows, is not a formula for developing a deep understanding of\nthe workings of NRMs.\nThe Americans who visited Japan at Aum\u2019s request were even more\nhampered in their activities. Linguistic barriers prevented them from\ngaining access to the rank and file and from ascertaining what really\nwas happening in Japan at the time. The scholars were, in effect,\ndependent on the English-speaking members of the movement\u2019s elite\nwho had invited them. This clearly appears to have affected Lewis\u2019\njudgment. Invited by a movement that was denying that it had\ncommitted any crimes, he appears to have been swayed by\nimpressionistic feelings towards his hosts and their talk of conspiracies.\nHe exonerated them because, it would appear, they were simply too\nnice to be mass murderers.21 They may indeed have come across as nice,\ndecent people, but they were also lying rather skillfully. In April as in\nJanuary 1995 (when it invited Shimada to speak up for them), Aum\nShinriky\u00f4 was engaged in a process of deception, denying responsibility\nfor crimes it had committed, playing on the sympathies of scholars,\nand using them as a defense against its accusers. It was, however, not\nlong before the fa\u00e7ade cracked. By early May 1995, senior members of\nAum had begun to confess in great detail, admitting involvement in\nthe subway attack and leading the police to all manner of evidence that\ndemonstrated how wrong Lewis and Shimada had been. As further\ndetails of Aum\u2019s criminality emerged throughout the summer of 1995,\nthe errors committed by those who spoke up for Aum became\nincreasingly obvious, adding further to the crisis that, as Watanabe has\nnoted, surrounded religious studies in Japan.\nTHEMES AND CONSEQUENCES\nThe above is a very brief outline of problems that have arisen as a\nresult of interventions in the Aum affair by academics from Japan and\nfrom the West. Some of the lessons to be learned are fairly obvious.\n   375\nReader:  Aum Shinriky\u00f4 and Academic Integrity\nThe experiences of the scholars discussed here alert us again to the\nnecessity for caution in how one relates to a movement and how one\nconducts research into them. Whatever the reasons for their\nmisjudgments, the fact that these scholars had some form of association\nwith Aum\u2014in the one case receiving expenses and an airfare\u2014clearly\ncompromised them in the eyes of public critics for whom any positive\ncomment on Aum, or any acceptance of gifts from them, was taken as a\nsign of complicity in the movement\u2019s crimes. Although, as Massimo\nIntrovigne has argued, receiving funding from religious groups \u201cmay\ninfluence but does not necessarily control the results of research,\u201d22 this\npoint is rarely going to be acknowledged by critics of new religions or\nby the general public in a crisis atmosphere such as that of Japan in\n1995.\nThe problems encountered by the Japanese and American scholars\nmentioned above also came about because they appear to have accepted\nin a trusting way the assurances of their guides who, while acting as\npublic relations officers for the movement, were treated as informants. These\nscholars were not skeptical enough about what they were being told:\nShimada was too willing to accept Aum\u2019s assurances that the building\nwas not a chemical weapons laboratory, and Lewis similarly was too\nwilling to accept Aum\u2019s claims of oppression. As I have noted earlier,\nthis type of problem may be linked to the ways in which scholarly\ninvestigations of movements occur. If one works only at the higher levels\nof a movement and deals too much in their generalities, the potential\nfor misreading what is happening is liable to be increased. And, as\nStephen A. Kent and Theresa Krebs have commented, \u201csuperficial\nresearch can have very real and harmful effects.\u201d23\nScholars also need to question whether and to what extent the\nconflicts that have raged between scholars and anti-cult activists have\nled them to abandon a properly objective position for one that is\nimplicitly partial. Put another way, is there not a danger that, in\nresponding to appeals from religious movements, academics might\nunwittingly assume the mantle of a defender of religious freedoms\u2014a\nmantle that might not sit easily with the objectivity that is presumed to\nbe an academic\u2019s chief tool of trade? It is, of course, important for\nscholars to speak out when the civil rights of religious movements are\nin danger. However, the importance (and necessity) of such activities\nshould not lead scholars into the assumption that new religions against\nwhich accusations have been made are always or necessarily victims.\nResearchers need to remind themselves that, as the Aum case shows,\nreligious groups might also be skilled at knowing how to construct a\ncover-up for their activities.\nMichael Pye, a leading scholar of the religions of Japan, has addressed\nthese questions in an article entitled \u201cAum Shinriky\u00f4: Can Religious\nStudies Cope?\u201d24 Pye\u2019s basic point is that religious studies scholars need\n376\nNova Religio\nto adopt a more analytical and critical stance towards the interpretation\nof religions and towards the religious movements they study.25 He argues\nthat the Aum affair demonstrated a basic failure by scholars to penetrate\nbeneath the surface of religions and develop adequate critiques of them,\nespecially when they made extravagant claims\u2014as, he argues, Aum\nShinriky\u00f4 did when it claimed to be a movement striving to revive what\nit called \u201coriginal Buddhism\u201d\u2014or behaved in anti-social ways. He is\nalso critical of religious leaders such as the Dalai Lama for their apparent\nreadiness to allow themselves to be co-opted by other religious movements\nand to provide them with positive endorsements without a closer\ninvestigation of their activities.26\nThis echoes the argument made by Kent and Krebs when they point\nout the problems posed to objective scholarship when money comes\ninto the equation and when they assert that scholars can compromise\ntheir work by not taking adequately critical stances towards the religions\nthey study.27 Religious movements that seek positive press coverage can\nbe adept at using academics for their ends and may utilize their public\nrelations skills and their hospitality to create a good feeling in the minds\nof the scholars they invite. If scholars fail to consider the intentions of\ntheir hosts, then errors of the sort made in the Aum affair may well\nproliferate.\nI am not saying that adopting a critical stance means taking the line\nTakimoto and others would like\u2014a condemnatory one. However, I do\nemphasize how important it is for scholars to recognize that, as well as\nhaving the potential for activities that are honest, law abiding, and\nrespectful of individual rights, NRMs may engage in criminal activities.28\nProblems occur when those who respond to the appeal of a religious\nmovement for a clean bill of health overlook this point. Equally, a critical\nunderstanding of religions demands a wider recognition that NRMs in\ndispute with the law need not only be victims; as Aum has shown, they\ncan also be perpetrators of crimes.\nCONCLUSION\nI have discussed here a few of the ramifications of a case in which\nscholars have unwittingly compromised themselves and their colleagues.\nIn so doing I have amplified the charges made by activists campaigning\nagainst NRMs\u2014that scholars of religion in general may be lacking in\nobjectivity. This aspect of the Aum affair is not something of only\nmarginal relevance to scholars apart from those who specialize in\nJapanese NRMs or who work in Japan. Its messages should resonate\nthroughout the field. Just as the Waco tragedy has rightly impinged on\nthe consciousness of every NRM scholar, so too should the Aum affair\n   377\nReader:  Aum Shinriky\u00f4 and Academic Integrity\nand what it has to say about academic integrity. In Japan, as Watanabe\nhas shown, scholarship on new religions has been very much thrown\ninto question, and this has strengthened the hand of those who would\nlike to see all \u201cdeviant\u201d new religions (I use this term as it is used by\ncampaigners such as Takimoto) proscribed or restricted.29\nWhat makes the Aum affair especially worth considering is that it\nwas\u2014almost from the moment the sarin gas was released on the Tokyo\nsubway\u2014an open and shut case, in which direct evidence existed to\nlink the movement to a number of related crimes. Unlike so many of\nthe controversial issues that have been at the epicenter of debate over\nNRMs, there was little possible doubt about what had transpired in this\ncase. Police raids on Aum had already been prepared prior to the subway\nattack as a result of earlier Aum violence.30 As the evidence uncovered\nby the Japanese police in its raids and the confessions of many of its\nleading figures have shown, Aum Shinriky\u00f4 had committed numerous\ncriminal acts.31 In other words, this is a case in which scholars have\nspoken out on behalf of a religious movement or portrayed it as a victim\nof governmental conspiracies at a time when it was engaged in criminal\nactivities and when substantial evidence was already available to confirm\nthis fact.\nIt is a case in which scholars who studied and wrote about Aum\nprior to 1995 failed to detect or give credence to alleged evidence\nindicating that the movement might have committed atrocities. This\nundermines any assumptions that scholars can be necessarily trusted\nto report more accurately about new religions than can journalists. Even\nallowing for media excess, there was more accuracy in the reports on\nAum by journalists such as Egawa Sh\u00f4ko32 prior to the sarin attack or in\nthe partial accounts of anti-cultists such as Takimoto than in the scholarly\ndenials of Aum\u2019s involvement.\nAn important lesson that should be learned from the Aum affair is\nthat scholarly examinations of NRMs must be more thorough. As\nacademics we take pride in what we see as the scientific objectivity of\nour profession, especially when compared with that of journalists whose\nprimary concern is whether the story will sell rather than with the long-\nterm analysis of events. Indeed, it is not uncommon to hear scholars\ntalking about the necessity of prodding journalists to publish more solid\ninformation about new religions, but also bemoaning the difficulties\nof this task because of the mind-set that prevails in the media about\nnew religions.33 While it is important to educate journalists, it is also\nworth reflecting that the implicit assumptions that guide many scholarly\nattitudes towards the media\u2014they are wrong and need educating, and\nwe can teach them\u2014may not always stand up to scrutiny.\nAfter Waco much was said about how law enforcement agencies\nlistened to the wrong set of \u201cexperts.\u201d That affair might well have alerted\nlaw enforcement officials to the dangers of listening to one particularly\n378\nNova Religio\nopinionated group of experts and helped to persuade them to take\nmore notice of the analyses and perspectives provided by NRM scholars.\nThere is a danger, however, that due to the miscommunication and\nresulting overreaction by the authorities at Waco, a form of scholastic\ntriumphalism\u2014\u201cif you had listened to us, Waco would not have\nhappened\u201d\u2014has developed in the field. I believe that scholars of religion\nhave valuable things to say to law enforcement agencies and that we\ncan be of use in helping to broaden their understandings of key issues\nin the study of NRMs.34 However, I also feel that if scholars of religion\nare to play such a role they need to exhibit a note of caution by taking\nstock of the lessons of the Aum affair and the academic failings that it\nexposed.\nThe Aum affair should at the very least temper any sense of\ntriumphalism that Waco may have engendered by reminding us that\nscholars do not always display accurate understandings of religious\nphenomena. Flying to the defense of religious movements is an exercise\nfraught with danger, especially when one is not in full possession of the\ndata surrounding such groups. These are actions that can have disastrous\nconsequences for one\u2019s colleagues and the field in general, especially\nif those who make errors of judgment are slow to acknowledge them.\nWe need to recognize that when scholars operate primarily as defenders\nof religious movements they are following a particular agenda and as\nsuch run the risk of compromising their position as objective scholars.\nMoreover, they are handing ammunition to those who demand that\nscholars take a condemnatory rather than an analytically objective tack\non religious movements.\nThe Waco affair was an important and traumatic milestone in the\ndevelopment of the field and in the interactions between scholars and\nauthorities. It has influenced the debates about the role of scholars\nand will continue to do so for a long time. However, there is a danger\nthat it may remain too dominant a marker in these areas. I suggest it is\ntime to move on from Waco with regard to the ways in which scholars\ninteract with law enforcement agencies and to reassess how Waco has\ncolored opinions about the relationships between scholars, the media,\nand law enforcement agencies. History moves on, and in a sense we\nare no longer in the post-Waco era so much as the post-Aum era of\nthe study of NRMs. Aum, I would suggest, serves as a potential\ncounterweight to the conclusions many of us had drawn from Waco.\nWhile that affair may serve as a reminder to the authorities about the\nways not to deal with religious movements and of the importance of\nlistening to scholars, the Aum affair issues a cautionary warning to\nscholars about the dangers of making hasty conclusions about the nature\nof NRM controversies. It is essential that we take a critical stance towards\nthe movements we study so that we can maintain the degree of objectivity\nthat will be most beneficial to all concerned\u2014from the media we so\n   379\nReader:  Aum Shinriky\u00f4 and Academic Integrity\noften criticize, to the new religions we study, to the civil authorities who\nmay seek our advice from time to time. Otherwise there remains the\ndanger that scholars of religion will continue to be seen more as\napologists than as analysts of the movements they study.\nENDNOTES\n1 All Japanese names given in this article are in standard Japanese form, with the family\nname preceding the given name.\n2 Takimoto\u2019s comments are found in a dialogue between himself and a former member\nof Aum, Nagaoka Tatsuya, with whom Takimoto has worked on anti-Aum campaigns, in\nTakimoto Tar\u00f4 and Nagaoka Tatsuya, Maindo kontor\u00f4ru kara nigerete: Oumu Shinriky\u00f4\ndakkaishatachi no taiken [Escape from Mind Control: The Experiences of Former Members of\nAum] (Tokyo: K\u00f4y\u00fb Shuppan, 1995), especially 205\u2013208.

Aum\nregarded the mass media and journalists as special enemies engaged in a conspiracy to\ndestroy it. These comments were made by Asahara Sh\u00f4k\u00f4 in numerous books as well as\nin various sermons to his disciples: see, for example, Asahara Sh\u00f4k\u00f4, Vajray\u00e2na K\u00f4su\nky\u00f4gaku shisutemu ky\u00f4hon [The Vajray\u00e2na Course: A Systematic Teaching Manual] (Aum\nShinriky\u00f4: unpublished Xeroxed collection of Asahara\u2019s sermons to Aum initiates\nbetween 1988\u20131994), especially Sermon 41 (p. 271), which claims Aum was prevented\nfrom gaining converts due to what Asahara called \u201cAum bashing by the media,\u201d and\nSermon 49 (p. 315), which claims that the mass media had swamped the country with\nbad data that affected everyone, destroying their spiritual balance and leading them to\nruin.\n7 An account of a discussion (originally published in a popular Japanese youth magazine\nentitled Brutus in 1991) between Nakazawa and Asahara in which Nakazawa is\ncomplimentary to Asahara is published by Aum in Oumu Shinriky\u00f4, ed., Ris\u00f4 shakai\n[The Ideal World], special supplement No. 20, and Oumu Shinriky\u00f4, ed.,  Sonshi taidansh\u00fb\n[Collected Conversations with the Master], 1993, 12\u201320.\n8 Among Shimada\u2019s publications on Aum are Shimada Hiromi, \u201cOumu Shinriky\u00f4: sonshi\nto shukkeshatachi\u201d (\u201cAum Shinriky\u00f4: the Master and his Disciples\u201d), in Shinsh\u00fbky\u00f4 jidai\n380\nNova Religio\n[The Age of New Religions], ed.

See Watanabe, \u201cReactions\nto the Aum affair.\u201d\n15 As Massimo Introvigne (\u201cBlackmailing or Greenlisting? A European Perspective on\nthe New Cult Wars,\u201d Nova Religio 2, no. 1 [1998]: 16-23) notes, both of the scholars of\nreligion on this trip denounced the human rights violations that appeared to have\noccurred after the sarin attack, when hundreds of Aum members were rounded up and\nheld for long periods without charge even though (in Introvigne\u2019s words) they, \u201cunlike\nthe leaders, were certainly neither guilty nor aware of any criminal activity.\u201d A number\nof points are worth noting here. One is simply that the Japanese police, despite their\nmassive raids and mass arrests, acted within the law in Japan which allows them to hold\npeople for up to twenty-eight days without charge. I do not want to engage here in a\ndiscussion of a legal structure that I find oppressive and more concerned with social\nnorms than with individual human rights. However, in pragmatic terms\u2014as many\nJapanese friends have said to me subsequently\u2014it was through the extensive questioning\nof Aum members in this way that the police were able to bring the perpetrators to court\nand to find out the extent of Aum\u2019s weapons stockpiling.\nA second point is that the situation in April 1995 was an extreme one. To put it into\nsome perspective, the chemical weapon attack right at the heart of Japan (the subway\ntrains attacked were converging on the station beneath some of the main government\nministries) caused many deaths and injuries, and the public wanted the perpetrators\ncaught as soon as possible, especially as they clearly had the means to cause further\ndestruction. It should be noted that barely veiled threats that further atrocities would\noccur had emanated from Asahara after the attack, and that a series of other violent\nacts, including the attempted murder of the Japanese chief of police and various other\nfailed uses of chemical weapons, took place in the immediate aftermath of the sarin\nattack and raids on Aum. A number of those believed responsible for Aum\u2019s atrocities\n(such as Inoue Yoshihiro, one of Asahara\u2019s chief lieutenants) had evaded arrest and\nwere on the run. There were serious public fears that further atrocities might be\ncommitted, a fear that materialized most potently when an attempt to release cyanide\ninto the ventilation system of a major station in May 1995 was only just foiled (if it had\nbeen successful, many thousands might have perished), and when a bomb was sent to\nthe Tokyo governor\u2019s office on the day that Asahara was arrested in May 1995. Both\nthese attacks were committed by Inoue and other fugitive members of Aum. In such\ncontexts the message that American scholars brought relating to human rights\u2019 violations\nhad little positive impact on a public more concerned about the dangers posited to its\n   381\nReader:  Aum Shinriky\u00f4 and Academic Integrity\nbasic freedoms\u2014including the freedom to go about its daily business and ride its capital\u2019s\ntransport networks without fear or constraint. It was perhaps unsurprising, then, that\nthe basic public reaction was of some annoyance. The Americans were seen as defending\na movement that posed a severe public danger and that appeared to be placing the\nindividual rights of the members of that organization, which had been responsible for\nnumerous atrocities, above the needs and security of the public in general.\nBalancing the needs of the general public as compared to the demands of individual\ncivil rights is, of course, a very difficult issue, and it is an especially difficult one at a time\nof social danger and crisis such as that which existed in Japan in April\u2013May 1995. While\nI agree that the behavior of the Japanese police at that time\u2014and the laws of detention\nof suspects in Japan in general\u2014raise serious concerns, it is also important to note that,\nfrom the perspective of Japanese public opinion, the voicing of such concerns over the\nrights of Aum members at this point was probably the wrong complaint at the wrong\ntime.\n16 See Introvigne, \u201cBlackmailing or Greenlisting,\u201d 19. At the 1996 SSSR conference in\nNashville, Melton subsequently informed the author of this article that he had few doubts\nby the end of his visit to Japan of Aum\u2019s complicity.\n17 Lewis, \u201cJapan\u2019s Waco.\u201d\n18 Watanabe, \u201cReactions to the Aum Affair,\u201d 47.\n19 Ibid.\n20 On these issues see two review articles on the sociology of religion in Japan and the\nstudy of Japanese new religions (both focusing on Japanese scholarship): Ian Reader,\n\u201cReview article: Recent Japanese Publications on Religion,\u201d Japanese Journal of Religious\nStudies 16, no. 4 (1989): 299\u2013315 and Ian Reader, \u201cRecent Japanese publications on the\nNew Religions: The Work of Shimazono Susumu,\u201d Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 20,\nnos. 2\u20133 (1993): 101\u2013120.\n21 Lewis, \u201cJapan\u2019s Waco,\u201d 55.\n22 Introvigne, \u201cBlackmailing or Greenlisting,\u201d 19. Introvigne uses the aforementioned\ncase of Lewis and Melton in Japan as evidence. As he points out, the former published\nsomething saying Aum had been framed and the latter that it was involved. That two\nscholars paid by the same organization could produce wholly different results is,\nIntrovigne suggests, evidence that the money paid does not necessarily condition the\nresults produced. I do not find this argument especially plausible: the case in hand\ncertainly shows that some scholars are capable of saying what those who call on them\nwant them to say, even when the evidence points the other way.\n23 Stephen A.

Lewis claims that the issuing of gas masks to the\nJapanese police prior to the subway attack meant that the authorities knew the attack\nwas imminent and hence that they somehow were involved in it (Lewis, \u201cJapan\u2019s Waco,\u201d\n382\nNova Religio\n54). In reality, the gas masks were issued because the raids on Aum had already been\nplanned (as a result of earlier Aum crimes) and the authorities suspected that Aum\npossessed, and might possibly use, poison gases.\n31 The overwhelming weight of evidence that has been presented in the various Aum\ntrials currently still in progress, coupled with the confessions and guilty pleas of the\nlarge majority of those charged with such crimes, has been reported in numerous\nJapanese publications including Egawa Sh\u00f4k\u00f4, Oumu Shinriky\u00f4 saiban b\u00f4ch\u00f4ki [Record of\nObservations at the Aum Shinriky\u00f4 Trials], vols. 1 and 2 (Tokyo: Bungei Shunj\u00fb, 1996\u2013\n1997) and Ky\u00f4d\u00f4 Ts\u00fbshin Shakaibu, ed., Sabakareru Ky\u00f4so [The Religious Founder on Trial]\n(Tokyo: Ky\u00f4d\u00f4 Ts\u00fbshinsha, 1997).\n32 Among such accounts by journalists one should especially cite the work of Egawa\nSh\u00f4k\u00f4, herself a friend of the murdered lawyer Sakamoto, who pursued Aum for several\nyears and produced numerous criticisms and accounts of the movement that indicated\nher belief that it was dangerous. See Egawa Sh\u00f4k\u00f4, Ky\u00fbseishu no yab\u00f4 [The Ambitions of a\nMessiah], (1991; reprint, Tokyo: Ky\u00f4ikushiry\u00f4 Shuppankai, 1995).\n33 See, for example, James T. Richardson, \u201cThe Accidental Expert,\u201d Nova Religio 2, no. 1\n(1998): 31\u201343.\n34 The case of the Freemen in Montana might well be a case where the authorities not\nonly sought but listened to the advice of specialists of new religions, with positive results.\n35 This has clearly been the case in the Aum affair. For this reason I remain unhappy not\nonly about Shimada\u2019s rather equivocal responses (see above, note 11), which seek to\nportray him as something of a victim of the affair, but also those of Lewis. While it is\ninteresting to note (Introvigne, \u201cBlackmailing or Greenlisting,\u201d 23) that Lewis has\ninformed several colleagues in private conversations that he has changed his mind on\nthe affair subsequent to his article, it seems that some more open acknowledgment of\nthis change\u2014with a refutation of the article in question\u2014might be in order.\n"}
