Rather, there is only a \nseemingly endless array of relations, called \u2018thick\u2019 relations in the book, that may be loosely \ngrouped under the label \u2018causal\u2019, with a vast variety of different clusterings for different \npurposes. So I do not see Hitchcock\u2019s question as posing an objection. Once we have \nserved our purpose by labelling a relation \u2018causal\u2019, there may well be nothing added, helpful \nto this purpose, by noting further that the relation is one of feeding gasoline to the carburettor \nrather than, say, stuffing it in or making it available. For instance, if our purpose is to predict \nhow probabilistic changes propagate across a set of quantities supposing the probability of \none is changed \u2018surgically\u2019, this purpose is served once we can point to the probability-\nchange-making relations among these quantities and label them as \u2018causal\u2019 in the Bayes-\nnets sense. \n \nMy purpose in labelling a very great many relations as \u2018causal\u2019 is to counter current-day \n\u2018Humeans\u2019, like David Lewis, John Earman and Bas van Fraassen. These philosophers are \nenamoured of some one or another special set of features in nature, features that are \nconceived of as \u2018inert\u2019, \u2018non-active\u2019, \u2018temporally and spatially local\u2019 or whatever. A great many \nfeatures I see around me \u2013 and that appear to be essential in every successful scientific \nintervention I have studied \u2013 are missing from their special sets. These philosophers \u2013 the \n\u2018Humeans\u2019 \u2013 are the ones who make the causal\/non-causal distinction, with their favoured \nconcepts labelled \u2018non-causal\u2019. In maintaining that pushing, pinching, compressing, repelling, \nattracting and so forth are causal, I imply that these are not among the favoured sets of the \nHumeans and they are not reducible to features in these sets. And of course I also maintain \nthat they are every bit as much in the world, and play as great a role in real science, as the \n\u2018non-causal\u2019 features the Humeans admire.  \n \nSo, thick descriptions of relations labelled \u2018causal\u2019 need not be causal-content increasing. \nIndeed they can be causal-content decreasing. Consider \u2018the pesticide smothers eel worms\u2019, \nwhich is a possible thick description for an arrow in a causal-Bayes-net of Judea Pearl \nrepresenting \u2018the pesticide causes eelworm death\u2019. The arrow is appropriate only if \nsmothering is part of a set of relations that together satisfy the Bayes-nets axioms. But being \npart of such a set is not implied by \u2018smothers\u2019. This fact may make trouble for Longworth\u2019s \nown proposal, assuming, as I would, that being correctly representable by a causal-Bayes-\nnet arrow should be among Longworth\u2019s right-hand-side disjuncts.  \n \nI hope that Longworth can steer around this kind of problem, however, because the scheme \nhe offers can make causality a far more useful concept than I fear it to be. Consider: If thick \ndescriptions are not composites of \u2018causes\u2019 plus some non-causal description there may well \nbe criteria for the application of the thick label that don\u2019t include the characterizing features \npointed to in labelling the relation \u2018causal\u2019. If in turn the thick description implies these \nfeatures, we then have an independent way to identify when these features obtain. This is a \npowerful tool. Consider for instance how useful it would be to have independently accessible \ncriteria for when a set of relations satisfies the Bayes-nets axioms or transmits a mark or \nreliably produces a targeted outcome. \n \nThe possibility of inferring from thick descriptions to \u2018causes\u2019 is independent of the other half \nof Longworth\u2019s scheme, which takes causality to be analysable as a (possibly very long) \ndisjunction. Here I have a weaker view: Family resemblance is the best we can hope for.1 \nNor do I see why we need the stronger claim. If the upward implications from thick \ndescriptions to features characterizing causal laws work, Longworth\u2019s answer to Hitchcock \ngoes through whether or not a proper \u2018if-and-only-if\u2019 can be provided. And, as I just argued, \n                                                          \n1 Hence I don\u2019t really hold with Longworth\u2019s interpretation (iii) of me. \nthe upwards implications would be a boon whether or not Hitchcock\u2019s question raises \nproblems for my claims about thick relations. \n \nWith respect to \u2018if and only if\u2019, I think there\u2019s no point in doing it unless it can be done \nproperly. There I\u2019m sceptical. Hall\u2019s two concepts are not two concepts but two loose \ngroupings, as are the labels in Longworth\u2019s (DTC1). Consider just the probabilistic theory of \ncausality. HC&UT argues that the correct expression of it depends on the exact form of the \ncausal-probabilistic laws at work as well as a variety of facts about the population. Nor \nshould this be surprising. Causation is a concept from ordinary life \u2013 what Otto Neurath \ncalled a \u2018ballungen\u2019 concept:2 a vague, rough-edged congestion of ideas and criteria that \nserves a lot of different purposes at once and often none of them very precisely. As Stuart \nHampshire maintained, such concepts should not be subject to more rigour than they can \nbear.  \n \nYet to figure in science they must be rigorous. Even narrowing consideration to scientific \ncontexts, though, I would not expect \u2018if-and-only-if\u2019 to be possible. As Sophia Efstathiou \nstresses,3 when ordinary concepts are brought into science they get transformed and \ntransformed into concepts that do different but very specific jobs in different sciences in \ndifferent ways. Quantum field theory requires a different concept of causation than bicycle \nmakers do, which is different again from concepts needed in various social sciences. Even \nwithin economics a number of different concepts are available, and useful, as HC&UT \nillustrates. There\u2019s no reason to think that this array of scientifically-transformed causal \nconcepts is finite or fixed or has any system to it. \n \nAs to Weber\u2019s comments, I agree with all, except his interpretation of me and his enthusiasm \nfor IARC. I am less enthusiastic not because I advocate less diversity, but more. My \ndistinction between methods that clinch conclusions and those that merely vouch for them is \npart of a larger study of evidence-ranking and conclusion-grading schemes.4 There is now \nan array of these, all looking much like IARC\u2019s, though often less nuanced. I argue that we \nneed accounts of 1)the quality of evidence \u2013 how likely is the evidence claim to be true, \n2)relevance \u2013 in what ways and how strongly does it bear on the conclusion, and 3)how to \nevaluate conclusions in light of all evidence. Most guides focus on 1), ignore 2)5 and give \nflawed advice about 3).  \n \nIn IARC we see 1) in the assessment of individual studies (\u201cEach [epidemiological] study is \nassessed according to three criteria\u2026.\u201d; for experimental animals, \u201cConclusion (1) is drawn if \nthere are high quality studies\u2026\u201d).6  3) is done in two steps: First assign sufficient, limited, \ninadequate or lack labels for each of the three categories (epidemiological, animal studies, \nmechanistic); second, draw the conclusion labelled \u2018group x\u2019 according to the rules Weber \nsketches. So we can conclude \u201ccarcinogenic to humans\u201d if there is sufficient epidemiological \nevidence for carcinogenicity in humans and we can conclude this if \u201ca positive relationship \nhas been observed in studies in which chance, bias and confounding could be ruled out with \nreasonable confidence.\u201d Thus unbiased, etc. epidemiological studies trump the rest: Positive \nresults from these yield a positive conclusion even if evidence from the other modes is \ninadequate or negative.  \n                                                          \n2 For further discussion of this see Cartwright, Cat, Fleck and Uebel (l996). \n3 See Efstathiou (2009) on what she calls \u2018founded\u2019 concepts. \n4 See my website (http:\/\/personal.lse.ac.uk\/cartwrig\/Default.htm) for my own papers on these topics and \nreferences therein to others. \n5 For instance, relevance, as opposed to quality and methods for drawing overall conclusions, is not explicitly \naddressed in the IARC scheme. But looking at the scheme, as Weber describes it, it appears that the relevance of \npositive epidemiological results on some human population to \u2018is carcinogenic to humans\u2019 is taken for granted (I \nthink fallaciously), whereas the relevance of animal results requires a hypothesis about shared mechanisms. \n6 IARC (2006). \n \nWhy? The only sensible reason I have come up with is that of chapter I.3: These unbiased \n(etc.) studies are clinchers \u2013 given the background assumptions,7 a probabilistic difference \nin the occurrence of cancer between exposed and unexposed groups deductively implies \nthat the agent caused cancer in the study population.8 The importance of discussing \nclinching is not, as Weber suggests, to argue that a single study is sufficient but the reverse. \nWhy prefer these studies? \u2018Because they are unbiased (etc.)\u2019. What\u2019s so good about that? In \nthe end, I take it, the answer is that lack of bias (etc.) is enough to guarantee the conclusion. \nBut now it is hard to see why these studies trump others. Deductive conclusions are only as \nsure as their premises. Premises are never certain.9 So the conclusions aren\u2019t either. We \ngive a good shot at ensuring the premises. But why have more confidence that we have \nsucceeded than we have in arguments that may have equally \u2013 or even more \u2013 secure \npremises but not such a tight fit between premises and conclusion? From this perspective \nthe most sensible procedure seems to be to look at all the studies together and give an \noverall evaluation, as best possible, not to suppose that following a recipe to reduce bias \n(etc) will always produce more reliable results than studies that rely on mechanisms or \nanimal models or even statistical studies with some bias. \n \nWeber also takes my connection between types of systems or types of conclusions on the \none hand and types of evidence on the other to suggest conclusions be drawn from one type \nof study alone. In a sense I maintain the reverse. All methods require background \nassumptions; when the assumptions fail, the methods cannot be taken to be reliable. Yet we \noften cannot tell whether the assumptions are met or not. It is good practice then to multiply \nstudies in order to control for error in assumptions, and in the end to make an overall \njudgment based on the pattern of results.  \n \nBeware though. The reliability of method depends on the type of conclusion drawn. So \nWeber\u2019s concern that differentiating kinds of conclusions, as I insist we must, restricts the \nmethods we can use to test them, is a correct one. Indeed it is one of the central lessons I \nurge, and one of great practical significance. We need to be clear about exactly what kind of \ncausal conclusion we are entitled to draw from our studies; and not out of philosophical \npurity but because the inferences we can go on to draw as we imbed that conclusion in other \ncontexts, combining it with other knowledge, depend intimately on what causal claim we \nhave established in the first place. Indeed, this is one of my worries about current causal \ninvestigations in the biomedical and social sciences: They are often sloppy about what the \ncausal conclusion drawn claims.10 \n \nWhat then of the scatter of methods Weber describes from IARC \u2013 epidemiological studies, \nstudies on model animals, studies of mechanisms? These can properly be used in a \ncomplex inference to establish not causal laws (which in my account are always population-\nspecific) but more abstract capacity claims: claims about a stable contribution the cause can \nmake. It is a complicated story about what is involved in a capacity claim and how such \nclaims can be justified.11 But epidemiological methods and studies of mechanisms can play \nan important role. \n                                                          \n7 Including common assumptions about the relation between causes and probabilities as well as the context-local \nassumptions that the two groups have the same distribution of other causally relevant features (unbiased) and \nthat there is a genuine probabilistic difference in outcome (the difference in frequency is not a result of chance). \n8 That\u2019s because, given the assumptions, the only possible explanation for the difference is that the agent caused \ncancers in some members of the exposed population. \n9 Including the broad metaphysical premise required in these arguments, which I discuss in HC&UT, that every \nprobabilistic difference requires a causal explanation. \n10 Sometimes this is \u2018remedied\u2019 by reporting precise statistical results. This can be an even worse practice since \nthese results are often only useful when interpreted causally \u2013 and that is the interpretation they are given. But in \nthis case the causal interpretation, being less explicit, is even less rigorously reviewed. \n11 For further discussion see Cartwright (2007) and (1989) and articles on my website on causal powers.  \n \nFinally, Weber urges attention to simulations and experiments in economics. We are again \nhere in agreement: This is an important topic. I discuss only thought experiments, in a \nchapter on \u2018idealized\u2019 models, though many of the cautions about \u2018overconstraining\u2019 \nrestrictions in the set-ups apply to actual experiments as well. Other than that, I leave \nexperiments and simulations to other colleagues, including Weber himself, who have more \ninteresting things to say than I would.12 \n \n \n \nReferences \n \nAlexandrova, Anna (2006), \u2018Connecting Economic Models to the Real World\u2019, Philosophy of \nthe Social Sciences, 36: 173-192.  \n---- (2007) \u2018Making Models Count\u2019, Philosophy of Science 75: 383-404.  \n \nCartwright, Nancy (1989).
