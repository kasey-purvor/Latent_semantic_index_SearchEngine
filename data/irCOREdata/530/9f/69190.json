Introduction ejections (CMEs). As a result HSSs are sometimes regardedThis special issue of the Journal of Atmospheric and\nSolar-Terrestrial Physics is devoted to research into high\nspeed solar wind streams (HSSs) and their effects on\nthe region of near-Earth space commonly known as\n\u2018geospace\u2019. Interest in the effects of HSSs has increased\nduring the last solar cycle and, following the successful\nmeeting focusing on corotating solar wind streams in\nManaus, Brazil (Tsurutani et al., 2006), we recognised the\nneed for further work on the topic, with particular focus\non HSSs and their effects in the inner magnetosphere,\nionosphere, and neutral atmosphere. As a result the High\nSpeed Solar Wind Streams and Geospace Interactions\n(HSS\u2013GI) Workshop was held at Hilltop, St. Martin\u2019s\nCollege in Ambleside, UK, from 2 to 7 September, 2007\n(Kavanagh and Denton, 2007; Denton et al., 2009),\nsponsored by the Department of Communication Systems\nat Lancaster University. The majority of the work pre-\nsented in this special issue was prompted by discussion\nand interaction at the workshop. It is indeed an indication\nof the importance of HSSs that the papers in this issue\ncover the entire region from the Sun and solar wind,\nthrough the magnetosphere, and into the ionosphere,\nthermosphere, and down to the stratosphere. It is hoped\nthat this research will stimulate more understanding,\nappreciation, and research, into these important drivers of\nphysical phenomena within geospace.\n2. High speed solar wind streams\u2014recent progress\nPeriodic HSSs have been known to exist since research\nby Snyder et al. (1963), with the source of such streams\nbeing traced to solar coronal holes by Krieger et al. (1973).\nSince this early work, further links between HSSs and\nrecurrent activity within geospace have been reported by\nnumerous authors, and the relationship between such\nevents and phenomena within the magnetosphere has\nbecome increasingly apparent.\nAs is widely known, HSSs typically produce less\nsignificant deflections in geomagnetic indices such as\nDst than transient phenomena such as coronal mass26\/$ - see front matter & 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n016\/j.jastp.2008.09.019as less important drivers of geomagnetic activity. This has\nled to many studies, where event-selection is based solely\non the Dst signature, overlooking HSS-events and hence\nneglecting their significance. At the workshop, this was\nreferred to as \u2018the Dst mistake\u2019. Comparisons between\nHSS- and CME-driven events do reveal important differ-\nences in their effects within all regions of geospace (e.g.\nLindsay et al., 1995; Borovsky and Denton, 2006) and\nwhilst CME-events certainly produce the largest geomag-\nnetic storms, HSS-events are particularly important for\nphenomena such as relativistic electron acceleration,\nradiation belt enhancements, and satellite anomalies\n(e.g. Wrenn et al., 2009). In terms of the energy input to\nthe magnetosphere, HSSs are found to input a total-\nenergy-per-event which is similar in magnitude to that\nduring CMEs; indeed the ratio of the energy-deposited-\nin-the-magnetosphere to the energy-input-to-the-magne-\ntosphere appears to be greater for HSSs than for CMEs (e.g.\nTurner et al., 2006, 2009; Kozyra et al., 2006; Guarnieri,\n2006).\nIt is known that HSSs are particularly important for\nacceleration and loss processes in the Earth\u2019s radiation\nbelts and in recent years much interest in the community\nhas focused on determining the principal acceleration and\nloss mechanisms (e.g. Tsurutani et al., 2006; Horne, 2007;\nLiemohn and Chan, 2007; Reeves, 2008). An important\nsource population for the ring current\/radiation belts is\nthe Earth\u2019s plasma sheet and in this issue the timescales\nfor delivery of plasma sheet material to the inner\nmagnetosphere during HSSs are evaluated by Denton\nand Borovsky (2008). Results indicate a super-hot and\nsuper-dense plasma sheet forms at the onset of a HSS-\ndriven storm and is convected Earthwards in a period of a\nfew hours. Energisation of this plasma sheet population\nduring HSSs leads to formation of a enhanced ring current\n(Jordanova et al., 2009; S\u00f8rb\u00f8 et al., 2009), which is\nsubsequently energised leading to enhanced fluxes in the\nradiation belts. Fluxes within the belts may fluctuate\nrapidly during HSSs revealing the balance between\nsources and sinks, and also our ability to reproduce such\nfluctuations using theoretical models (Lam et al., 2009).\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nEditorial \/ Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics 71 (2009) 1011\u201310131012The derivation of radiation belt radial diffusion coeffi-\ncients during periods of high speed solar wind is discussed\nby Pahud et al. (2009), who also examine the solar wind\nspeed dependence of ULF wave power using ground-based\nmagnetometer data.\nRecently, a number of authors have revealed the\nimportance of a 9-day periodicity in the solar wind speed\nand consequences for the lower atmosphere (e.g. Temmer\net al., 2007; Lei et al., 2008; Mlynczak et al., 2008; Thayer\net al., 2008). In this issue Emery et al. (2009) show that\nthe global electron hemispheric power (a proxy for the\nstrength of auroral activity) also exhibits a 9-day periodi-\ncity. Loss of energetic particles from the magnetosphere\ninto the atmosphere induces detectable changes in the\nEarth\u2019s ionosphere where an decrease\/increase in spectral\nhardness is evident during HSSs (Birch et al., 2009). Such\nenergetic particle precipitation (particularly relativistic\nelectron precipitation during HSSs) may induce the\ngeneration of NOx (odd nitrogen) at lower altitudes, with\npossible subsequent links to ozone depletion in the\nstratosphere (Turunen et al., 2009).\nThe large amplitude Alfve\u00b4nic fluctuations, which occur\nduring HSSs have implications for the generation of\nrecurrent substorms (Lyons et al., 2009; Morley et al.,\n2009), HILDCAAs (Tsurutani and Gonzalez, 1987), source\nand loss processes within the radiation belts (Sandanger\net al., 2009), and for resultant auroral activity (D\u2019Amicis\net al., 2009). In addition, superposed-epoch analysis\nindicates the Russell-McPherron effect also plays a role\nin the coupling between the solar wind and the magneto-\nsphere [McPherron et al., 2009]. Whilst it is clear that the\nsouthward-IMF coupling between the solar wind and the\nmagnetosphere during Alfve\u00b4nic fluctuations is important,\nit is still not clear whether there is a significant difference\nbetween the driving of the magnetosphere in an on\u2013off\nfashion versus a steady average fashion (Denton et al.,\n2009). In the future we plan to determine whether or not\nsuch on\u2013off driving is important.\nAlthough the papers contained in this special issue\nhighlight the importance of HSSs, and also reveal how\nphysical processes within geospace respond to HSS-\nevents, it is clear that much remains to be discovered\nabout these fascinating phenomena.Acknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank everyone who helped\nmake the 2007 Ambleside workshop such a successful and\nproductive meeting.
