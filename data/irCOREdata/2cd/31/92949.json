He adds, 'finally I also learned - it wasn't particularly difficult - to assert my own individuality as a sociologist, while at the same time familiarizing myself with what seemed to be significant and important in American social research. Later I attempted to convey this synthesis to my students' (p.141) - of whom Katz was one. 12 In this article, Katz argued that, while the study of short-term media effects is 'dead', research should now address not what the media do to people but what people do with the media (i.e. uses and gratifications) and thereby aim for a more complex link to effects by building a bridge to the humanist tradition of studying popular culture.","cites":null},{"id":17339412,"title":"13 Symptomatic of contemporary uses and gratifications, the typology of the active viewer proposed by Levy and Windahl","authors":[],"date":"1985","doi":null,"raw":"13 Symptomatic of contemporary uses and gratifications, the typology of the active viewer proposed by Levy and Windahl (1985) misunderstands the hermeneutic nature of meaning creation, seeing it as gaining 'a more or less clear understanding of the structure of the message' (p.115); other contributors to that volume also regard the text as a source of given and obvious messages (Livingstone, 1998b).","cites":null},{"id":17339414,"title":"14 The roots of the disputes in media theory over social psychology \u2013 i.e. about the autonomy and rationality of individuals subject to media influence - can be traced back to the 1920s and 30s.

Adorno's (1969) understanding of social psychology drew more on psychoanalysis, influenced by Fromm's work at the (Frankfurt) Institute of Social Research, than on the embryonic tradition of positivist social psychology. For researchers at the Institute before the Second World War, it was their explicit aim to develop a critical social psychology 'to explain the processes through which individual consciousness was adjusted to the functional requirements of the system, in which a monopolistic economy and an authoritarian state had coalesced' (Habermas, 1989: 293). This approach contrasts with the largely individualistic social psychology which developed in America, though Smith (1983) identifies Katz as part of this latter tradition, thus neglecting his more sociological concerns.","cites":null},{"id":17339402,"title":"5 Yet misreadings persist: for Sproule","authors":[],"date":"1989","doi":null,"raw":"5 Yet misreadings persist: for Sproule (1989), Personal Influence played a key role in (re)writing research history to create 'the magic bullet myth' of direct media effects in order to demonstrate the success of the Columbia School by putting media research on a scientific footing. Equally inappropriately, Personal Influence has been read as demonstrating null effects. It is important to recognize that Katz and Lazarsfeld felt themselves led by the data to emphasize the mediating, but not wholly undermining, role of the social and communicative context in processes of effect. And this in turn led Katz to argue against the kind of broad theorizing which results in what he sees as the untestable or at least typically untested theories of hegemony and ideology. Hence Boudon (1991) regards Personal Influence as an example of Merton's middle-range theory, where middle-range theories attempt to integrate relevant hypotheses (here, the idea of a two-step flow of influence) and empirical regularities but assume that 'it is hopeless and quixotic to try to determine the overarching independent variable that would operate in all social processes' (p.519).","cites":null},{"id":17339404,"title":"6 Thus the social psychology of the group is used to account for the diffusion of media effects, thereby linking interpersonal and mass communications in a manner often neglected in subsequent research (although see Hawkins,","authors":[],"date":"1988","doi":null,"raw":"6 Thus the social psychology of the group is used to account for the diffusion of media effects, thereby linking interpersonal and mass communications in a manner often neglected  in  subsequent research (although  see Hawkins, Wiemann, & Pingree, 1988). 7 This is by contrast with the traditional model, which holds that the communication process is essentially linear, with the audience positioned as passive receiver at the end of an influential and unidirectional process of information transmission.","cites":null},{"id":17339407,"title":"9 Katz characterizes each decade in the history of mass communications as an oscillation between conceptions of active and passive viewers, and hence between minimal effects and powerful media (Katz,","authors":[],"date":"1980","doi":null,"raw":"9 Katz characterizes each decade in the history of mass communications as an oscillation between conceptions of active and passive viewers, and hence between minimal effects and powerful media (Katz, 1980), though, in a moment of disillusion, Katz concluded that 'we teeter back and forth between paradigms, without getting very far. We need to perform some crucial experiments and to agree on appropriate research methods rather than just storing a treasury of contradictory bibliographical references in our memory banks' (1992: 85). This oscillation can itself be seen as stemming from the contradictions within the liberal-pluralist approach to media research, an approach which sees the audience both as public and as mass (Livingstone, 2005). However, from the addition of interpersonal communication as a second step in the flow of media influence in the 1950s, to the selective and motivated viewer of The Uses of Mass Communications (1974) in the 1970s, the interpretive, culturally grounded viewer countering cultural imperialism in The Export of Meaning in the late 1980s, and the locally embedded but symbolically connected viewer of Media Events in the early 1990s, he has consistently argued for a socio-psychological, selective viewer (not, however, a wholly autonomous or \u2018sovereign\u2019 consumer). Hence, 'the effects of the media are mitigated by the processes of selectivity in attention, perception, and recall, and ...17 these, in turn, are a function of predispositional and situational variables such as age, family history, political affiliation, and so on' (Katz, 1987: S26) \u2013 it is the task of research to map these processes of selectivity and their dependence on social context. 10 Katz (personal communication) suggests that for Lazarsfeld administrative research takes the client's problem as given while critical research asks whether the client may be part of the problem.","cites":null},{"id":17339368,"title":"A paradigm for the study of the sociology of knowledge.","authors":[],"date":"1955","doi":null,"raw":"Merton, R.
