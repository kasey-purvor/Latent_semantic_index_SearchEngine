I do not think it helps to say that\n\u2018technical\u2019 here has a \u2018technical meaning\u2019. It is possible to argue that to the\nextent that we approach \u2018getting through\u2019 to a child as a \u2018technical problem\u2019,\nwe show that we are just another remote professional. For this term betrays\nsomething about the way we are trying to approach our client. What Rustin\nshows us here is her imaginative and courageous engagement with this boy,\nrather than an ability to locate and deploy the correct technique.\nThe imagination, thoughtfulness and courage of a therapist are what\nattracts me, humbles me and makes me feel that I am learning something\nabout how one person may be of help to another. I do not think that work of\nsuch quality is a natural consequence of being trained to identify the \u2018technical\nproblems\u2019. I suspect that good work in psychotherapy comes from the prac-\ntitioner\u2019s humanity, from sensitivity, from a habit of thoughtfulness that can\nbe cultivated, given the right sort of experiences, by a good education.\nA time may come when it seems obvious to people who are involved in\npsychotherapy, whether as clients, therapists, students or educators, that\nthe notion of people being \u2018trained\u2019 to be psychotherapists raises some\nimportant questions. One of these questions is whether therapy is largely or\n*Email: o.brooks@roehampton.ac.uk\nPsychodynamic Practice\nVol. 14, No. 2, May 2008, 207\u2013214\nISSN 1475-3634 print\/ISSN 1475-3626 online\n\u0002 2008 Taylor & Francis\nDOI: 10.1080\/14753630801932967\nhttp:\/\/www.informaworld.com\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n17\n:5\n4 \n15\n F\neb\nru\nar\ny \n20\n10\nsimply a technical matter, for which people need to be adequately \u2018trained\u2019,\nor whether to talk about it as if it is like this is a confusing and misleading\nway of thinking and speaking about the subtleties and complexities of\nhuman conversations or interactions. Even if it is accepted that all therapists\nand related practitioners \u2013 whether hypnotherapists, practitioners of\nEye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing [EMDR] or of Reike,\nScientologists or Fortune Tellers \u2013 need to be trained so that they master\nand can therefore apply a set of interrelated concepts and ideas, need to be\ninducted into a way of seeing and thinking \u2013 it is still possible to take the\nview that with the \u2018talking\u2019 therapies, or, more accurately, the exploratory\nconversational therapies \u2013 for all therapies involve talking or gesturing \u2013\n\u2018training\u2019 is not enough. It is not enough to \u2018train\u2019 a practitioner so that he\ncan apply ideas from one or two or many psychotherapeutic theories or\napproaches: therapists also need to be educated about psychotherapy, and\nabout people, in the way that good literature helps to educate us about being\na person. As well as not being enough, \u2018training\u2019 might be too much and\nmight get in the way of being able to listen to and respond to another human\nbeing.\nWe might begin to expect and encourage our students to develop a\ncritical view of what they are being taught, to develop a historical sense\nabout this thing called \u2018psychotherapy\u2019, as well as some sense of the\nphilosophical and political issues involved in it. Being educated in or about\npsychotherapy would involve discouraging narrowness in would-be-\ntherapists. By this I do not mean that a student might be expected to\nknow about Klein as well as about Freud: to take the bus into the\nneighbouring street is not to become a citizen of the world. I think it is\nimportant that students acquire some appreciation of the importance and\ninescapability of philosophical ideas and positions in psychotherapeutic\ntheories and practice, but here I want to claim that great literature may have\na part to play in helping to \u2018educate\u2019 rather than \u2018train\u2019 therapists, and, in\nparticular, that reading and discussing Hamlet as a group may be a very rich\nand rewarding experience for a students of psychotherapy.\nHamlet\u2019s situation and interpretations\nI will not try to summarize the play but will give the barest reminder or\nprompt. Hamlet sees what appears to be the ghost of his recently-deceased\nfather. Hamlet\u2019s uncle, his father\u2019s brother, is now married to Hamlet\u2019s\nmother. The ghost tells Hamlet that his uncle, the current king, murdered\nhim and beguiled his mother. The ghost urges him to take revenge. Hamlet\ndoes not do this.\nMany things have been said about his not taking revenge. For example,\nhis failing as a tragic hero \u2013 his fatal \ufb02aw \u2013 is said to be that he is a\nprocrastinator. Freud, in The interpretation of dreams, claims that Hamlet is\n208 O. Brooks\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n17\n:5\n4 \n15\n F\neb\nru\nar\ny \n20\n10\nunable to act because of his own repressed childhood wishes to do away with\nhis father and take his father\u2019s place with his mother: Hamlet\u2019s Oedipus\nComplex. He cannot take revenge on his uncle because he feels himself to be\nas bad as his uncle. Hamlet, therefore, reproaches himself rather than takes\nrevenge (Freud, 1991, pp. 366\u2013368).\nA group of therapists or therapists-to-be might busy themselves with\nlooking for the evidence for such assertions and consider if what Freud\nsays about the play seems to be arbitrary and tendentious, designed to\nadvance the cause of psychoanalysis. I am certainly not suggesting that we\ntry to impose a psychoanalytic or any other psychotherapeutic inter-\npretation on this play, and that this is the way to \u2018educate\u2019 students. In\nfact my claim is that to read a work of great literature, or to listen to a\ncase presentation and then \ufb01t the words and events into a theory is more\nconsistent with what is usually referred to as \u2018training\u2019. It is a procrustean\nattempt to \ufb01t what we see and hear into what we believe or what is\nfamiliar, and this is headed in the opposite direction to where I think that\ngreat literature may take us: that is, to some sense of wonder, some sense\nof where our knowing ends, and humility rather than hubris about our\ntheories.\nI am not arguing that there is absolutely no place for tendentious or\nforced reading of literature in order to help the student to \u2018get\u2019 something\nhe or she is struggling to \u2018understand\u2019. I am arguing that these sorts of\nreadings are always questionable. How di\ufb03cult is it, if one looks hard\nenough, to \ufb01nd something in literature that might seem to support one\u2019s\nown position? Is there something suspect in implicitly or explicitly claiming\nthat Sophocles or Shakespeare have made the same observations or have\nhad the same insights as the theory that one is trying to promote, that they\nare proto-versions of what one is? Instead of being used to return us to a\ntheory or to support an approach in psychotherapy, to close down the\nmeaning and signi\ufb01cance of what we hear or read, great literature may\nentice us to leave the security of our theories and our prejudices and\nconsider the issues the work puts before us. Hamlet may help us to\nappreciate that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt\nof in our philosophy.\nMight it be possible for a group of psychotherapists to read Hamlet\nwithout speculation about whether his not taking bloody revenge is an\nindication that something must have been amiss in his early life? We could\nspeculate about Hamlet\u2019s attachment to his father here, talk about\nambivalence \u2013 his hating as well as loving his father, which is supposed to\naccount for his not taking revenge on his father\u2019s murderer, but it is di\ufb03cult\nto \ufb01nd anything in the text that supports this sort of speculation. I am not\nwriting about being \u2018evidence based\u2019: it is about being attentive to what you\nactually see and hear, and being wary about imposing your own favourite\nstories on what is in front of you.\nPsychodynamic Practice 209\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n17\n:5\n4 \n15\n F\neb\nru\nar\ny \n20\n10\nHamlet as a study of madness\nStudents of psychotherapy may be presented with Hamlet as a study of\nmadness. While it is certainly clear that Ophelia goes mad, and that the\nking is a\ufb04icted, it is not clear that Hamlet is mad. Is he mad or feigning\nmadness? Therapists and therapists-to-be may wish to consider how such a\njudgement may be made, and whether in their work they do or will \ufb01nd\nthemselves trying to decide if a client or patient is really mad or just\npretending to be so, why they would pretend to be, and how important it is\nto be able to make this distinction. Whatever verdict may be returned on\nHamlet\u2019s sanity, it is clear that this play presents us with an example of\nmourning, trauma and despair. Hamlet\u2019s father is dead. He thinks that his\nmother has married his father\u2019s murderer, his father\u2019s own brother, and now\nhe feels that he should do what a dutiful son in his time and of his birth\nwould do, that is to murder his uncle. Hamlet is, like our clients and like us,\ncaught up in events that precede him that he cannot quite understand or be\ncon\ufb01dent about. We can \ufb01nd ourselves caught up in terrible things, with no\nattractive alternatives.\nWords\nWe do not speak English as Shakespeare spoke it in his time, but without\nbeing able to follow every single word we are able to follow what is\nhappening. This seems to me to be not unlike the situation with some clients\nin particular, where you can get the gist of what they are saying but you are\npuzzled by how they use many of the words they use, where you may have a\nsense of being with the person but of not understanding many of the words\nthey use. It seems to be a useful exercise for therapists and therapists-to-be\nto see what they can make of this sixteenth century English.\nThere are many complicated exchanges and relationships in this play.\nThere are tricks, plots, strategies, but none of the characters can speak a\nlanguage of \u2018technical problems\u2019 when considering their relationship with\nsomeone else. The Bard cannot put such a term in the mouths of his\ncharacters, for he is not in the power of that science-worshipping spirit that\nsees science as the arbiter of sense, and aspires to reduce everything to a\n\u2018technical problem\u2019, solvable only in the language of science because it is\nonly intelligible in such a language. There is beauty in the words, drama, wit,\nirony. People are involved with each other; no one is able to take up the\nposition of the disinterested observer. The poet does not try to explain too\nmuch about his characters and the events that they are caught up in. What\nwe see is what there is.\nHamlet is reading a book. Polonius asks Hamlet, \u2018What do you read, my\nlord?\u2019. Hamlet replies, \u2018Words, words, words\u2019. We and Hamlet read words,\nwe hear words as we see and hear the accompanying gestures, the\n210 O. Brooks\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n17\n:5\n4 \n15\n F\neb\nru\nar\ny \n20\n10\nintonations, the spaces between the words, the comportment of the body of\nthe person uttering the words. Students of psychotherapy may wish to\nconsider whether we ever get behind and beyond the words into what the\nperson really means and feels, or whether we can only witness and respond\nto more words and their accompanying gestures? Perhaps a therapist might\nlearn something from Hamlet about being sensitive to, paying more\nattention to words and gestures, rather than worry about whether it\nsupports any particular theory, or about what Shakespeare really meant\nby this play. Hamlet\u2019s instructions to the player about making the word and\nthe emotion \ufb01t may be, for example, a useful thing for therapists to think\nabout.\nThere is much in the play about deception and seduction. Words usually\nplay the central role in this. I think that the way in which the king is said to\nhave killed Hamlet\u2019s father, by what seems to be the ghost of Hamlet\u2019s\nfather, is far from insigni\ufb01cant: by pouring poison into his ear.\nPsychotherapists may wish to discuss what they understand by this. The\nmedical opinion I have sought about this tells me that there is not very much\nthat will actually poison a human being if it is administered through the ear;\nbut words do a \ufb01ne job here. Usually, daily, human beings poison and\ncorrupt each other with words. We destroy or corrupt another\u2019s peace of\nmind, sense of proportion, good humour or even temper. The king somehow\npoisons his brother \u2013 Hamlet\u2019s father \u2013 he pours poison into the ear of\nHamlet\u2019s mother, so she is seduced and her judgement is impaired. She\nmarries the murderer before her husband is cold in the ground, and thus the\nthrone, which should have passed to Hamlet, goes to the uncle who\nmurdered the legitimate king. Laertes also has poison poured into him from\nthe king\u2019s words and actions. At the end of the play we see that many die\nfrom poison.\nHamlet seems to be concerned that the spirit that seems to be the ghost\nof his father is something that is trying to pour poison into his ear.\nTherapists may wish to consider whether Hamlet \u2018fails\u2019 to act \u2013 the word is\nof course important \u2013 or whether he is to be admired for not acting. That is,\nfor suspecting that the ghost may be an evil spirit, or may be a manifestation\nof his grief, and so in either case, he would be deceived, beguiled or poisoned\ninto doing something terrible. Is it possible to read Hamlet as su\ufb00ering from\nthe poison that is around him but not succumbing to it? Not dishing it out,\nnot murdering. Do we need to think about how often in Shakespeare do\npoisonous words lead to terrible deeds? Would we say that Othello was right\nand Hamlet was wrong? What would we say to Hamlet if he consulted us\nand told us of his thoughts about killing his uncle because he believes that\nhis uncle murdered his father? How would we respond to his telling us that\nhe knows this to be so because his father\u2019s ghost told him so?\nHamlet would not be \u2018passion\u2019s slave\u2019 (Hamlet, Act III, Scene ii).\nPerhaps we might think about this in the context of the young men some of\nPsychodynamic Practice 211\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n17\n:5\n4 \n15\n F\neb\nru\nar\ny \n20\n10\nus see who seem to be slaves to their passions and their appetites. They must\nhave revenge, they must have what they want. Therapists may wish to\nthink again about Hamlet\u2019s so-called \u2018procrastination\u2019 and \u2018failure to act\u2019\nand wonder if this is what we are trying to do with at least some of our\nclients.\nIt is clear that human beings can be and often are deceived or seduced by\neach other and by themselves. Hamlet would not be deceived. Reading\nHamlet gives therapists or would-be-therapists an opportunity to re\ufb02ect on\nhow easily we are deceived and seduced not only by others but by ourselves.\nOur needs and our vanities listen and speak. We may wonder about how\nmuch we are seduced and convinced by our teachers, our theories, our\ngeneralizations, how safe, powerful and important we feel when we can\npresent ourselves to others and to ourselves as knowing about people or \u2018the\nmind\u2019, with little thought that we too are persons and supposedly use our\n\u2018minds\u2019 to know \u2018minds\u2019. How can we know whether the person who is\nspeaking is telling us the truth, even when we are the person speaking?\nPhilosophy\nStudents of psychotherapy may be able to move from seeing Hamlet as\nfailing to do something, to becoming intrigued by what he manages to do.\nThis is not simply a reminder to the therapist to consider what the person or\nevent is, rather than what we would like it to be or think that it should be \u2013\nfor client and therapists too often need to be reminded \u2013 it is because Hamlet\nhas achieved something remarkable. For much of the play, he is\ncontemplating the senselessness of human life. His father kills someone,\nsomeone kills his father, he kills this person, someone else may kill him, but\nwhat is the point? Where is the sense in all of this? Hamlet does not pursue\nbloody revenge, nor is he poisoned by his meditation on life. Towards the\nend of the play he is remarkably free from resentment of life. He is not afraid\nof death either, stating that if it does not come now, it will come later; if it is\nnot to come, it will be now. He is able to \u2018Let be\u2019 or \u2018let it be\u2019 (Act V, Scene\nii, lines 209\u2013212, and 327).\nSome of us work with families who are locked in feuds that seem to go\nback further than anyone can really remember or account for, young men\nwho are preoccupied with revenge for the smallest slight, people who are\nconsumed with resentment of the hand that fate has dealt them. I shall not\ntry to write about the parts of the world in which tit-for-tat revenge destroys\nmore lives than anyone is able to count, or that each day seems to bring this\nworld closer to our world. I want to say that grief and pain hidden by\nthoughts of revenge or actual acts of revenge, and people stuck in\nresentment about how their life has been, are met with regularly in the\nconsulting room. How do we help our clients to forego, see past, not to take\nrefuge in revenge and resentment? Hamlet may not tell us how to do this for\n212 O.

It is easy to quip that this is why he cannot\ncome to a decision and act, but perhaps to recourse to such a cliche\u00b4 betrays\nthe fact that one knows little about philosophers, for there are many, both\nancient and modern, who were far from unable to decide what to do with\nthemselves, who made music, danced, dared to hold tyrants and generals in\nconversation about their shortcomings, fought in wars, refused to be spared\nhardship if this meant leaving others to su\ufb00er it alone, chose death rather\nthan a life that seemed not to belong to them, and decided to resign posts as\nacademic philosophers. Perhaps a group of therapists studying Hamlet\ntogether might wonder what signi\ufb01cance to give to his being a philosopher.\nShakespeare presents him as a noble soul. Hamlet has quite a bit to say\nabout \u2018man\u2019 and his dishonesty, his baseness, the smiling villains, the slaves\nof passions, the lack of honour and dignity. Why did Shakespeare present\nhim thus and have him say such things? We may want to ask what, if\nanything, his being a philosopher has to do with his views and his actions,\nand what is Shakespeare\u2019s attitude to philosophy? Has Hamlet been\neducated by philosophy, and if so what kind of philosophy? Students of\npsychotherapy may leaveHamlet wondering what philosophy has to do with\nHamlet\u2019s behaviour and character, and hence his education. They might\nleave the play wondering whether it seems to be a sustained inquiry into life,\nand noting how much questioning and searching for answers there is in it.\nMight a student or two wonder about another philosopher \u2013 one who\nmight be said to have \u2018failed\u2019 to escape from death when he was given the\nopportunity to do so \u2013 and whether the Socratic method and dialogue has\nanything at all to do with Hamlet. Socrates did not \u2018fail\u2019 to escape from\nprison; it was important to him not to escape, although he had the power\nand the possibility to do so. Both he and Hamlet seem to have the power to\ndo what they refrain from doing: they may have the strength of giants, but\nthey do not live as wanton giants, doing just what they are able to get away\nwith. His not doing what most would do in his situation might be regarded\nas a success: to not do what those around us would do, to pause and think\nabout the deed, how just it is, irrespective of whether others take it as just\nand acceptable, to worry about our warrant for the deed and the sort of\nperson such a deed would make us, these are the sorts of \u2018failures\u2019 of which\nwe have much need. We could see the history of philosophy from Socrates\nthrough to Nietzsche, Derrida and Levinas as attempts to arrange and\nencourage such \u2018failures\u2019. Psychotherapy along with philosophy and\nliterature can help to facilitate and encourage these \u2018failures\u2019.\nThis might be a doorway for some into considering the relationship\nbetween philosophy, education and therapy. Perhaps some will be interested\nin the doorway; perhaps most will not be.
