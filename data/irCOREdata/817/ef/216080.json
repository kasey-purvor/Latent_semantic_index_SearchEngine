In addition, we indicate why the operational independence of quantum subsystems\nholds quite generally, both in nonrelativistic and relativistic quantum theory.\n1 Introduction\nThe aim of this note is to propose mathematically well defined formulations of the notion\nof \u201coperational independence\u201d of two subsystems S1, S2 of a larger quantum system S\nand to clarify their relation to other independence concepts in the mathematical physics\nliterature. In addition, we shall indicate why the operational independence of quantum\nsubsystems holds quite generally, both in nonrelativistic and relativistic quantum theory.\nIntuitively, operational independence of subsystems S1 and S2 expresses the notion\nthat any two physical operations (measurements, state preparations etc) which can be\ncarried out on S1 and S2 separately can also be carried out jointly as a single operation\non system S.\nIt will be seen that operational independence can be given different technical for-\nmulations within the context of operator algebraic models of quantum systems. If the\nobservables of quantum systems S1, S2 and S are represented by selfadjoint elements of\n\u2217e-mail: M.Redei@lse.ac.uk\n\u2020e-mail: sjs@math.ufl.edu\n1\nC\u2217-subalgebras A1,A2 of a C\u2217-algebra A, then S1 and S2 are called operationally C\u2217-\nindependent in A if any two completely positive, unit preserving maps T1 and T2 on A1\nand A2, respectively, have a joint extension to a completely positive, unit preserving map\nT on A (Definition 6). Completely positive maps T satisfying T (I) \u2264 I are called oper-\nations in the physics literature, since they can be used to represent physical operations\ncarried out on the quantum systems [10, 21]. If the observables of the quantum systems\nin question are represented by von Neumann algebras, then it is natural to require the\noperations T1, T2 and T to be normal (continuous in the \u03c3-weak topology) \u2013 the resulting\ndefinition is operational W \u2217-independence (Definition 7). Requiring that the extension T\nfactors across the subalgebras (and preserves faithfulness) leads to Definitions 8 and 9.\nIn this paper we shall explain the relations of these notions to the already established\nnotions of subsystem independence in the literature and, in so doing, provide some useful\nalternative characterizations of operational independence. In addition, we shall be able to\ndemonstrate that the strongest form of operational independence formulated here obtains\nquite generally in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics and in relativistic quantum field\ntheory.\nWe outline the structure of the paper. Section 2 recalls some notions of independence\nwhich have been investigated in the literature and which are relevant from the perspective\nof operational independence. Section 3 recalls the concept of operation as a completely\npositive map on C\u2217-, resp. W \u2217-, algebras together with some basic properties of com-\npletely positive maps. Section 4 formulates the definitions of operational independence in\nterms of completely positive maps and establishes their logical relations with the notions\ndescribed in Section 2. Finally, in Section 5 the relation to a further, previously studied\nindependence property called the split property is explained, and this relation is used to\nshow that operational independence holds widely in quantum theory.\n2 Some notions of independence\nThroughout the paper A denotes a unital C\u2217-algebra, A1,A2 are assumed to be C\u2217-\nsubalgebras of A (with common unit I). A1 \u2228A2 will denote the smallest C\n\u2217-subalgebra\nof A containing both A1 and A2. N denotes a von Neumann algebra, and N1,N2 will be\nvon Neumann subalgebras of N (with common unit). N1 \u2228 N2 will denote the smallest\nvon Neumann algebra in N containing both N1 and N2. If N is a von Neumann algebra\nacting on the Hilbert space H, then N \u2032 represents its commutant, the set of all bounded\noperators on H which commute with all elements of N . S(A) is the state space of the\nC\u2217-algebra A. (For the operator algebraic notions see [31], [20] or [3].) For a Hilbert\nspace H, the set of all bounded operators on H is denoted by B(H).\nSince there are different quantitative and qualitative aspects to the notion of indepen-\ndent subsystems, it is natural that there be many theory dependent formulations of such\nindependence. We discuss only a few of these here. The following technical definitions of\nindependence were formalized in the context of algebraic quantum theory in a compre-\nhensive review up to 1990 of the hierarchy of independence concepts and their non-trivial\nlogical interrelations [28]. See [28] for a discussion of their operational meaning and their\nhistory. For more recent developments, see [14, 22, 18].\nDefinition 1. A pair (A1,A2) of C\u2217-subalgebras of a C\u2217-algebraA is called C\u2217-independent\nif for any state \u03c61 on A1 and for any state \u03c62 on A2 there exists a state \u03c6 on A such that\n2\nboth\n\u03c6(X) = \u03c61(X) for any X \u2208 A1\n\u03c6(Y ) = \u03c62(Y ) for any Y \u2208 A2\nobtain.\nDefinition 2. A pair (A1,A2) of C\u2217-subalgebras of a C\u2217-algebraA is called C\u2217-independent\nin the product sense if the map \u03b7(XY )\n.\n= X\u2297Y extends to an C\u2217-isomorphism of A1\u2228A2\nwith A1\u2297A2, where A1\u2297A2 denotes the tensor product of A1 and A2 with the minimal\nC\u2217-norm (see [31, 20, 13]).\nIf A is faithfully represented on a Hilbert space H, then the minimal norm referred to\nhere is the ordinary operator norm in B(H)\u2297 B(H) \u2243 B(H\u2297H).\nDefinition 3. A pair (N1,N2) of von Neumann subalgebras of the von Neumann algebra\nN is called W \u2217-independent if for any normal state1 \u03c61 on N1 and for any normal state\n\u03c62 on N2 there exists a normal state \u03c6 on N such that both\n\u03c6(X) = \u03c61(X) for any X \u2208 N1\n\u03c6(Y ) = \u03c62(Y ) for any Y \u2208 N2\nobtain.\nDefinition 4. A pair (N1,N2) of von Neumann subalgebras of the von Neumann algebra\nN is called W \u2217-independent in the product sense if for any normal state \u03c61 on N1 and for\nany normal state \u03c62 on N2 there exists a normal product state \u03c6 onM extending \u03c61 and\n\u03c62, i.e. a normal state \u03c6 on N such that\n\u03c6(XY ) = \u03c61(X)\u03c62(Y ) for any X \u2208 N1, Y \u2208 N2 .\nThe above independence notions are not independent logically. Here we collect some\nresults on their interrelations. Note that only C\u2217-independence in the product sense\nrequires that the algebras mutually commute. The apparent asymmetry between the\ndefinitions of C\u2217-, resp. W \u2217-, independence in the product sense will be resolved below\n(for mutually commuting von Neumann algebras acting on a separable Hilbert space).\nProposition 1.\n1. If A1,A2 are commuting, then the C\n\u2217-independence in the product sense of (A1,A2)\nimplies the C\u2217-independence of (A1,A2), but the converse is false [28].\n2. W \u2217-independence of a pair of arbitrary von Neumann algebras implies C\u2217-independence\nof the pair [28, 14], but the converse is false. In fact, examples of pairs of von\nNeumann algebras which do not mutually commute have been found which are C\u2217-\nindependent but not W \u2217-independent. But if N1,N2 are commuting von Neumann\nalgebras acting on a separable Hilbert space, then the C\u2217-independence of (N1,N2)\nimplies the W \u2217-independence of the pair [14], so that for such pairs C\u2217-independence\nis equivalent to W \u2217-independence.\n1These are the states which can be represented by a density matrix. Hence, in general, physicists\ntacitly restrict their attention to normal states.\n3\n3. The W \u2217-independence in the product sense of (N1,N2) implies the W \u2217-independence\nof (N1,N2), but the converse is false [28].\n4. If N1,N2 are commuting, then the W \u2217-independence in the product sense of (N1,N2)\nimplies the C\u2217-independence in the product sense of (N1,N2), but the converse is false\n[28, 14]. (This is further discussed below.)\nNote that ifA1,A2 are commuting C\u2217-algebras, then the extension state \u03c6 in Definition\n1 may be chosen to be a product state [24], i.e.\n\u03c6(XY ) = \u03c6(X)\u03c6(Y ) = \u03c61(X)\u03c62(Y ) ,\nfor all X \u2208 A1, Y \u2208 A2. The corresponding assertion for W \u2217-independence is false [28].\nIndeed, in that context one has the following theorem.\nProposition 2 ([30]). Let N1,N2 be commuting factor von Neumann algebras acting on\na common Hilbert space H. Then the map \u03b7(XY )\n.\n= X\u2297Y extends to a W \u2217-isomorphism\nof N1\u2228N2 with the W \u2217-tensor product N1\u2297N2 if and only if there exists a normal product\nstate on N1 \u2228N2.\nIn fact, the assumption that the algebras be factors may be dropped if the normal\nproduct state is required to have central support I, the identity map on H [11]. Hence,\none has the following result.\nProposition 3. Let N1,N2 be commuting von Neumann algebras acting on a separable\nHilbert space. Then (N1,N2) is W \u2217-independent in the product sense if and only if there\nexists a faithful normal product state on N1 \u2228N2.\nProof. Let (N1,N2) be W \u2217-independent in the product sense. Since the Hilbert space on\nwhich the algebras act is separable, there exist faithful normal states \u03c61, \u03c62 on N1,N2,\nrespectively [31, Prop. II.3.19]. But then \u03c61 \u2297 \u03c62 is a faithful normal state on N1\u2297N2\n[31, Cor. IV.5.12]. If \u03b7 : N1 \u2228 N2 \u2192 N1\u2297N2 is the hypothesized W \u2217-isomorphism, then\n(\u03c61\u2297 \u03c62) \u25e6 \u03b7 is a faithful normal product state on N1 \u2228N2. For the converse, see [30, 11].\n\u2660\nAn analogous characterization of C\u2217-independence in the product sense was proven in\n[14].\nProposition 4 ([14]). Let A1,A2 be commuting subalgebras of a C\n\u2217-algebra A acting on\na separable Hilbert space. Then (A1,A2) is C\u2217-independent in the product sense if and\nonly if there exists a faithful product state on A1 \u2228A2.\nThese results resolve the asymmetry between the definitions of C\u2217-, resp. W \u2217-, in-\ndependence in the product sense, at least in the indicated important special case. It\ntherefore follows that for a pair of commuting von Neumann algebras acting on a separa-\nble Hilbert space, W \u2217-independence in the product sense implies C\u2217-independence in the\nproduct sense. However, the converse is false \u2014 see below.\n4\n3 Positive and completely positive maps\nRecall that a linear map T : A \u2192 B can be extended to a linear map Tn : Mn(A)\u2192 Mn(B)\n(here Mn(A) is the set of n by n matrices with entries which are elements from the C\u2217-\nalgebra A) by\nTn\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\na11 . . . a1n\n. . .\nan1 . . . ann\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\nT (a11) . . . T (a1n)\n. . .\nT (an1) . . . T (ann)\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 .\nDefinition 5. T is completely positive if Tn is positive for every n \u2208 N. A completely\npositive map T : A \u2192 A satisfying T (I) \u2264 I is called an operation [10, 21]. An operation\nT such that T (I) = I is said to be nonselective. An operation T on a von Neumann\nalgebra N is called normal if it is \u03c3\u2013weakly continuous. A positive linear map T : A \u2192 B\nis faithful if T (X) > 0 whenever A \u220b X > 0.\nThe dual T \u2217 of a nonselective operation defined by\nT \u2217 : S(A)\u2192 S(A) T \u2217\u03c6\n.\n= \u03c6 \u25e6 T\nmaps the state space S(A) of A into itself. If T is a normal nonselective operation on the\nvon Neumann algebra N , then T \u2217 takes normal states to normal states.\nOperations are the mathematical representatives of physical operations, i.e. physical\nprocesses which take place as a result of physical interactions with the quantum system.\n(For a detailed interpretation of operations see [21].) A state on A is a completely positive\nunit preserving map from A to C [2]. So, if \u03c6 is a state on A, then\nA \u220b X 7\u2192 T (X) = \u03c6(X)I \u2208 A (1)\nis a nonselective operation in the sense of the above definition, which is canonically asso-\nciated with the state and which may be interpreted as the preparation of the system into\nthe state \u03c6. Further examples of operations are provided by measurements. In particu-\nlar, if one measures a quantum system with observable algebra B(H) for the value of a\n(possibly unbounded) observable Q with purely discrete spectrum {\u03bbi} and corresponding\nspectral projections Pi, then according to the \u201cprojection postulate\u201d this measurement\ncan be represented by the operation T defined as\nB(H) \u220b X 7\u2192 T (X) =\n\u2211\ni\nPiXPi \u2208 B(H) . (2)\nT is a normal nonselective operation.\nA classic result characterizing certain completely positive maps was established in [25].\nProposition 5 (Stinespring\u2019s Representation Theorem). T : A \u2192 B(H) is a completely\npositive linear map from a C\u2217-algebra A into B(H) if and only if it has the form\nT (X) = V \u2217pi(X)V X \u2208 A ,\nwhere pi : A \u2192 B(K) is a representation of A on the Hilbert space K and V : H \u2192 K is\na bounded linear map. If A is a von Neumann algebra and T is normal, then pi can be\nchosen to be a normal representation.\n5\nSo, in particular, C\u2217-homomorphisms are completely positive. A corollary of Stine-\nspring\u2019s theorem was proven by Kraus [21].\nProposition 6 (Kraus\u2019 Representation Theorem). T : B(H)\u2192 B(H) is a normal opera-\ntion if and only if there exist bounded operators Wi on H such that\nT (X) =\n\u2211\ni\nW \u2217\ni\nXWi\n\u2211\ni\nW \u2217\ni\nWi \u2264 I .\nCompare with equation (2).\nIt is important in Stinespring\u2019s theorem that T takes its value in the set of all bounded\noperators B(H) on a Hilbert space. This is related to the fact that operations defined on\na subalgebra of an arbitrary C\u2217-algebra are not , in general, extendible to an operation\non the larger algebra [2]. Indeed, a C\u2217-algebra B is said to be injective if for any C\u2217-\nalgebras A1 \u2282 A every completely positive unit preserving linear map T1 : A1 \u2192 B has\nan extension to a completely positive unit preserving linear map T : A \u2192 B. It was\nshown in [2] that B(H) is injective.\n4 Operational independence\nIn the light of these considerations, the following generalizations of C\u2217-andW \u2217-independence\nare natural.\nDefinition 6. A pair (A1,A2) of C\u2217-subalgebras of C\u2217-algebra A is operationally C\u2217-\nindependent in A if any two nonselective operations on A1 and A2, respectively, have a\njoint extension to a nonselective operation on A; i.e. if for any two completely positive\nunit preserving maps\nT1 : A1 \u2192 A1 , T2 : A2 \u2192 A2 ,\nthere exists a completely positive unit preserving map\nT : A \u2192 A\nsuch that\nT (X) = T1(X) for all X \u2208 A1\nT (Y ) = T2(Y ) for all Y \u2208 A2 .\nDefinition 7. A pair (N1,N2) of von Neumann subalgebras of a von Neumann algebra\nN is operationally W \u2217-independent in N if any two normal nonselective operations on\nN1 and N2, respectively, have a joint extension to a normal nonselective operation on N .\nSince operations defined on a subalgebra need not be extendible to a larger algebra in\ngeneral, it is important in Definitions 6 and 7 that operational independence of subalgebras\nis defined with respect to some fixed larger algebra. Note, however, that, here and below,\nthis joint extension then has further extensions to arbitrary superalgebras, as long as the\nrange of the first extension is interpreted as mapping into an injective algebra, which\nremains the fixed range of the further extensions.\nOperational C\u2217-independence expresses the notion that any operation (measurement,\nstate preparation etc) on system S1 is co-possible with any such operation on system S2\n6\n(if these systems are represented by C\u2217-algebras \u2014 similarly for W \u2217-algebras). Given\na nonselective operation T , its dual T \u2217 takes states into states; hence, the content of\noperational C\u2217-andW \u2217-independence also can be formulated in terms of changes of states\nof the systems involved: Operational C\u2217-independence of (A1,A2) entails the feature that\nany transition of state \u03c61 of S1 into state \u03c81 is compatible with any transition \u03c62 of S2\ninto state \u03c82. That is to say, these two transitions can take place as a transition of a single\nstate \u03c6 of S into state \u03c8. Operational W \u2217-independence has a similar interpretation in\nterms of transitions between normal states on the respective von Neumann algebras.\nIn analogy with C\u2217-andW \u2217-independence in the product sense, the following strength-\nened versions of operational C\u2217-and W \u2217-independence seem natural.\nDefinition 8. A pair (A1,A2) of C\u2217-subalgebras of a C\u2217-algebra A is operationally C\u2217-\nindependent in A in the product sense if any two (faithful) nonselective operations on A1\nand A2, respectively, have a joint extension to a (faithful) nonselective operation on A\nwhich is a product across A1 and A2; i.e. if for any two (faithful) completely positive unit\npreserving maps\nT1 : A1 \u2192 A1 , T2 : A2 \u2192 A2 ,\nthere exists a (faithful) completely positive unit preserving map\nT : A \u2192 A\nsuch that\nT (X) = T1(X) for all X \u2208 A1 (3)\nT (Y ) = T2(Y ) for all Y \u2208 A2 (4)\nT (XY ) = T (X)T (Y ) X \u2208 A1 Y \u2208 A2 (5)\nDefinition 9. A pair (N1,N2) of von Neumann subalgebras of a von Neumann algebra\nN is operationally W \u2217-independent in N in the product sense if any two (faithful) normal\nnonselective operations on N1 and N2, respectively, have a joint extension to a (faithful)\nnormal nonselective operation T on N which is a product across N1 and N2 in the sense\nof eq. (5).\nWe first remark that in Definition 9 the prima facie additional requirement that faithful\noperations are extended by faithful operations is superfluous in the case of states. In other\nwords, W \u2217-independence in the product sense entails that faithful states can be extended\nby faithful product states (cf. the proof of Prop. 3). This is not true in the case of states\nin Definition 8 [19]. The status of this additional requirement is under investigation in\nthe case of general operations [19]. The assumption is added here for reasons which will\nbecome apparent below.\nStates provide special cases of operations, yet C\u2217-and W \u2217-independence are not ,\nstrictly speaking, special cases of operational C\u2217-and W \u2217-independence. Indeed, C\u2217-and\nW \u2217-independence require a narrower class of operations on S1 and S2 to have a joint ex-\ntension, but the joint extension must belong, in turn, to that narrower class of operations\n(the states). On the other hand, operational C\u2217-and W \u2217-independence require a larger\nclass of partial operations to have a joint extension, but the extension can be in that\nlarger class of operations. Thus C\u2217-and W \u2217-independence on one hand, and operational\nC\u2217-and W \u2217-independence on the other, are prima facie not related in a straightforward\n7\nmanner. Let us examine this relationship more closely. Assume that (A1,A2) is opera-\ntionally C\u2217-independent in A. Let \u03c61 and \u03c62 be two states on A1 and A2, respectively.\nAs mentioned earlier, the two maps\nT1(X) = \u03c61(X)I , X \u2208 A1 , (6)\nT2(Y ) = \u03c62(Y )I , Y \u2208 A2 , (7)\nare completely positive unit preserving maps on A1 and A2, respectively, so by assump-\ntion, T1 and T2 have a joint extension T to A. This T need not be associated with a state;\nhowever, for any state \u03c6 on A, the state T \u2217\u03c6 on A is clearly an extension of both \u03c61 and\n\u03c62. It is clear that similar reasoning remains valid if the states \u03c61, \u03c62 and \u03c6 are assumed\nto be normal states on operationally W \u2217-independent von Neumann subalgebras N1 and\nN2 of N . What is more, if operational independence in the product sense obtains, then\none has\nT \u2217\u03c6(XY ) = \u03c6(T (XY )) = \u03c6(T (X)T (Y )) = \u03c6(T1(X)T2(Y )) = \u03c61(X)\u03c62(Y ) , (8)\nfor all X \u2208 A1, Y \u2208 A2, and for any state \u03c6 \u2208 S(A). We observe that operational inde-\npendence in the product sense thereby entails the existence of operations which prepare\nthe quantum system presented in any initial (normal) state into a product state yielding\nany two prescribed (normal) partial states. This is a remarkable property; therefore it is\nnoteworthy that operational independence in the product sense can be verified in rather\ngeneral circumstances (see the next section). In light of these remarks, we have a series\nof propositions; the proofs of the first two are now immediate.\nProposition 7. Operational C\u2217-independence of (A1,A2) in A entails the C\u2217-independence\nof the pair (A1,A2).\nProposition 8. OperationalW \u2217-independence ofN1 and N2 inN entails the W \u2217-independence\nof the pair (N1,N2).\nNote that in Propositions 7 and 8 the algebras (A1,A2) and (N1,N2) are not assumed to\nbe commuting.\nBefore proceeding to the next results, we need the following proposition. A proof of\nmost, but not all, of the assertions in this proposition using the Stinespring representation\ntheorem can be found in [13, Lemma 2.5]. We present an alternative argument here which\nalso establishes the remaining points.\nProposition 9 ([13]). Let A1,A2,B1,B2 be unital C\u2217-algebras and let T : A1 \u2192 B1 and\nS : A2 \u2192 B2 be (faithful) completely positive maps. Then T \u2297 S : A1 \u2297A2 \u2192 B1 \u2297 B2 is\na (faithful) completely positive map. If A1,A2,B1,B2 are von Neumann algebras and T\nand S are normal, then T \u2297 S : A1\u2297A2 \u2192 B1\u2297B2 is normal.\nProof. That T \u2297 S is completely positive, resp. normal, under the stated conditions is\na consequence of [31, Prop. IV.4.23, Prop. IV.5.13]. So let S and T be faithful and\n0 6= A \u2208 A1 \u2297 A2. Let I\u02c6A1 , resp. I\u02c6A2 etc, denote the identity map on A1, resp. A2 etc.\nThese maps are completely positive.\nFirst, consider the case A2 = B2. By [31, Thm. IV.4.9] there exist \u03c61 \u2208 S(A1),\n\u03c62 \u2208 S(A2), such that (\u03c61 \u2297 \u03c62)(AA\u2217) 6= 0. Let T1, T2 be the completely positive maps\n8\ndefined in (6), (7). Since I\u02c6A1 \u2297 T2 is completely positive and AA\n\u2217 is positive, one must\nhave (I\u02c6A1 \u2297 T2)(AA\n\u2217) \u2265 0. And since\n(\u03c61 \u2297 \u03c62)(I\u02c6A1 \u2297 T2)(AA\n\u2217) = (\u03c61 \u2297 \u03c62)(AA\n\u2217) 6= 0 ,\none must also have (I\u02c6A1 \u2297 T2)(AA\n\u2217) 6= 0. One therefore concludes (I\u02c6A1 \u2297 T2)(AA\n\u2217) > 0.\nNote that (I\u02c6A1 \u2297 T2)(AA\n\u2217) can be naturally identified with a strictly positive element of\nA1 as follows. Given the state \u03c62 on A2, one has the left slice map L : A1 \u2297 A2 \u2192 A1\nwhich satisfies\nL(\n\u2211\ni\nXi \u2297 Yi) =\n\u2211\ni\n\u03c62(Yi)Xi .\nThis map is completely positive [3, II.9.7.1], and one has (I\u02c6A1\u2297T2)(AA\n\u2217) = L(AA\u2217)\u2297IA2 ,\nwhere IA2 is the unit in A2. Therefore, L(AA\n\u2217) > 0. But then\n(I\u02c6B1 \u2297 T2) \u25e6 (T \u2297 I\u02c6A2)(AA\n\u2217) = (T \u25e6 L(AA\u2217))\u2297 IA2 > 0 ,\nsince T is faithful. This entails that (T\u2297 I\u02c6A2)(AA\n\u2217) 6= 0 and thus T \u2297 I\u02c6B2 is faithful (recall\nIA2 = IB2 here). A similar argument implies that I\u02c6A1 \u2297 S is faithful in the case A1 = B1.\nIn the general case, one notes that T \u2297S = (T \u2297 I\u02c6B2) \u25e6 (I\u02c6A1 \u2297 S), and the proposition\nfollows. \u2660\nAn immediate consequence of this observation is given next.\nProposition 10. Let A1,A2 be mutually commuting C\u2217-algebras acting on a separable\nHilbert space. The pair (A1,A2) is C\n\u2217-independent in the product sense if and only if it\nis operationally C\u2217-independent in A1 \u2228A2 in the product sense.\nProof. Let (A1,A2) be C\u2217-independent in the product sense, so there exists a C\u2217-isomorphism\n\u03b7 : A1 \u2228 A2 \u2192 A1 \u2297 A2 such that \u03b7(XY ) = X \u2297 Y , for all X \u2208 A1 and Y \u2208 A2. If Ti\nis a (faithful) completely positive unit preserving map on Ai, i = 1, 2, then T1 \u2297 T2 is a\n(faithful) completely positive unit preserving map on A1\u2297A2. Thus, (T1\u2297T2) \u25e6 \u03b7 is such\na map on A1 \u2228 A2 and satisfies all the conditions required to establish the operational\nC\u2217-independence in A1 \u2228A2 in the product sense of (A1,A2).\nConversely, let (A1,A2) be operationally C\n\u2217-independent in A1 \u2228 A2 in the product\nsense. There exist faithful states \u03c61, \u03c62 on A1,A2, respectively (there exist such states on\nA1\u2032\u2032 and A2\u2032\u2032 by [31, Prop. II.3.19] \u2014 just restrict these to A1 and A2, respectively), so\nthat T1, T2 defined as in (6) and (7) are faithful operations on A1,A2, respectively. By\nhypothesis, there exists a faithful joint product extension T on A1 \u2228 A2. Choosing the\nstate \u03c6 in equation (8) to be faithful on A1\u2228A2, one then has a faithful product state on\nA1 \u2228A2. Prop. 4 completes the proof. \u2660\nOf course, a similar argument yields the analogous result in the W \u2217-case.\nProposition 11. Let N1,N2 be mutually commuting von Neumann algebras acting on a\nseparable Hilbert space. The pair (N1,N2) is W \u2217-independent in the product sense if and\nonly if it is operationally W \u2217-independent in N1 \u2228 N2 in the product sense.\n9\nIn light of Propositions 1, 10 and 11, we can then conclude that operational W \u2217-\nindependence in the product sense is strictly stronger than operational C\u2217-independence\nin the product sense. In fact, choosing N1 to be the hyperfinite type III factor2 and\nN2 = N1\n\u2032, the pair (N1,N2) is C\n\u2217-independent in the product sense, but it is not W \u2217-\nindependent in the product sense [28, 14]. (This situation actually arises in relativistic\nquantum field theory \u2014 cf. e.g. [28].)\nProposition 12. Let N1,N2 be mutually commuting von Neumann algebras acting on a\nseparable Hilbert space. For the pair (N1,N2), operational W \u2217-independence in N1 \u2228 N2\nin the product sense implies operational C\u2217-independence in N1\u2228N2 in the product sense,\nbut the converse is false.\n5 Operational independence and the split property\nIn this section we discuss the relation of operational independence with a further well\nstudied independence property and use this relation to demonstrate that operational\nW \u2217-independence in the product sense holds quite generally in both nonrelativistic and\nrelativistic quantum theory. The independence property in question is a strengthening of\nW \u2217-independence in the product sense.\nDefinition 10. A pair (N1,N2) of von Neumann subalgebras acting on a Hilbert space\nH is called W \u2217-independent in the spatial product sense if the map\nXY \u2192 X \u2297 Y X \u2208 N1 Y \u2208 N2\nextends to a spatial isomorphism of N1 \u2228 N2 with N1\u2297N2, i.e. there exists a unitary\noperator U : H \u2192 H\u2297H such that UXY U\u2217 = X \u2297 Y for all X \u2208 N1, Y \u2208 N2.\nIn general, W \u2217-independence in the spatial product sense is strictly stronger than\nW \u2217-independence in the product sense [11]. However, there are many commonly met\nsituations in which they are equivalent [11, Thm. 1, Cor. 1], in particular when either\nof the von Neumann algebras is a factor or either is of type III. W \u2217-independence in\nthe spatial product sense is, in turn, known to be equivalent to an important structure\nproperty of inclusions of von Neumann algebras, which has been intensively studied for\nthe purposes of both abstract operator algebra theory and algebraic quantum field theory.\nProposition 13 ([5]). For a mutually commuting pair (N1,N2) of von Neumann algebras,\nthe following are equivalent.\n1. There exists a type I factor M such that N1 \u2282M \u2282 N2\u2032.\n2. (N1,N2) is W\n\u2217-independent in the spatial product sense.\nAlthough according to the usage introduced in [12] we should say that the pair (N1,N2\u2032)\nis split, it is for our purposes more convenient to say that a pair (N1,N2) of von Neumann\nalgebras is split if condition (1) in the previous proposition holds.\nAs a consequence of the results discussed above, it is now evident that operationalW \u2217-\nindependence in the product sense obtains in many physically relevant settings. In order\n2See [20, 31] for a description of the Murray\u2013von Neumann classification of von Neumann algebras and\nsubsequent refinements. See also [23] for a discussion of the necessity and physically relevant consequences\nof the various types of von Neumann algebras in quantum theory.\n10\nnot to lengthen this note unduly, we shall make some brief comments and not formulate\nspecific theorems.3\nIn nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, the algebras of observables are typically type I\nfactors; therefore in that setting mutually commuting algebras of observables are necessar-\nily split. Hence, such pairs of algebras are operationally W \u2217-independent in the product\nsense.\nIn relativistic quantum theory [1, 16], where the algebra of observables A(O) carries\nthe interpretation of the algebra generated by all observables measurable in the space-\ntime region O, the local algebras A(O) are typically type III von Neumann algebras\n[15, 8]. Hence, for spacelike separated spacetime regions O1,O2 (for which A(O1) and\nA(O2) mutually commute), the operational W \u2217-independence in the product sense of\n(A(O1),A(O2)) is equivalent to the pair being split. In [7, 32] it has been shown that, in\nthe presence of the additional structures present in algebraic quantum field theory, the\nsplit property is equivalent to the local preparability of arbitrary normal states on the\nlocal algebras; this latter involves a special case of the operation (6) (cf. also [28, Thm.\n3.13] for a formulation which does not require those additional structures). Hence, the\nequivalences we have established above are not unexpected.\nThe split property has been verified for all strictly spacelike separated4 (precompact,\nconvex) regions O1,O2 in a number of physically relevant quantum field models, both in-\nteracting and noninteracting [5, 26].5 Moreover, the split property for all strictly spacelike\nseparated (precompact, convex) regions O1,O2 has also been shown to be a consequence of\na condition (nuclearity) which expresses the requirement that the energy\u2013level density for\nany states essentially localized in a bounded spacetime region cannot grow too fast with\nthe energy and assures that the given model is thermodynamically well\u2013behaved (e.g. ther-\nmal equilibrium states exist for all temperatures [6, 9]). Hence, for such regions the pair\n(A(O1),A(O2)) of observable algebras typically satisfies operational W \u2217-independence in\nthe product sense. On the other hand, in general, pairs (A(O1),A(O2)) associated with\nregions which are spacelike separated and tangent are not W \u2217-independent in the prod-\nuct sense [27, 28] (although they are W \u2217-independent) and therefore not operationally\nW \u2217-independent in the product sense. Moreover, pairs (A(O1),A(O2)) associated with\ncertain unbounded spacelike separated regions (e.g. wedges) cannot be split [5] and thus\nare not operationally W \u2217-independent in the product sense.\nAcknowledgement: Work supported in part by the Hungarian Scientific Research Found\n(OTKA), contract number: K68043.\nReferences\n[1] H.
