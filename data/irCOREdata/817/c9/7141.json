The UK\u2019s Joint Information Systems Committee,\nfor example, has spent the past two years supporting a programme of research into\nthis topic, both from the perspective of the teacher (understanding designing for\nlearning) and more recently from the perspective of the learner (understanding the\nlearner\u2019s experience).\nWhat is different, this time around? The promise of technology to revolutionise\nteaching has a long-established history that seems to have failed to materialise. In the\nmid-1950s, Skinner proposed the idea of the teaching machine; even earlier, the US\nmilitary had made a serious commitment into what would become educational tech-\nnology by looking at the potential of video for training. We can chart a long series of\ndevelopments since\u2014the microcomputer, computer-based training, multimedia, the\nweb. And yet we are still trying to understand this relationship between technology\nand learning.\nMeanwhile, the media debate has provided background noise\u2014McLuhan\u2019s claim\nthat the medium is the message and the counter-arguments that the medium has no\neffect on message content confusing matters still further. Which is more na\u00efve: to look\nfor an effect of technology on learning, or to assume that there will be none?\nI was recently involved in a small European project that set out to explore the rela-\ntionship between technology use and the roles that teachers undertook. As part of\nthis, a colleague (Sara Price, Institute of Education) and I analysed some interviews\nundertaken with lecturers who were starting to use virtual learning environments for\nthe first time. Perhaps, in retrospect, it should have been obvious\u2014but our analysis\nsuggested that, for these people, teaching with a new medium was the same and\ncompletely different simultaneously. It all depended upon how they framed teaching.\nWhen they talked about it strategically, nothing changed: they still had to conceive\nthe curriculum, monitor students\u2019 progress, provide feedback, and so on. At an inter-\nmediate level, the actions they undertook were slightly different: they would check\ncontributions to a bulletin board, for example, instead of trying to spot who was\nsitting quietly on the edges of the seminar; different tools were used, but the practices\nwere recognisable. At a fine-grained level of analysis, none of their original practices\n134 Editorial\nremained. Button clicks and typing replaced conversation; automated records\nreplaced sensitive observation.\nSo was there a new pedagogy? Yes and no; it all depended on how you looked at\nthe situation.\nThis is the situation we have now reached with research. If there is progress on this\ntopic, it has been to recognise the complexity of the problem, rather than to provide\na simple answer. In various ways, this complexity is played out across the articles\nincluded in this issue. Malcom Rutters describe work that seeks to preserve the ideals\nof education but realise them in new forms. A. Kamil Mahmood and Elaine Ferneley\nare, arguably, involved in trying to establish what the strategic purposes of particular\neducational traditions are, in order that new technologies can be designed to support\nthem. Thiemo M\u00fcller-Kalthoff and Jens M\u00f6ller describe a study that explores the\nmatch between a new set of learning operations and strategic aspirations to foster\nunderstanding. Rhona Sharpe, Greg Benfield and Richard Francis describe some-\nthing slightly different, however \u2013 their exploration of the role of strategies in effecting\norganisational change initially seems to have little to do with the immediacy of peda-\ngogy. Yet even here, the production of a document is being used to help groups of\nteachers work through what their educational strategy is, so that their subsequent use\nof technology supports rather learning, rather than just information management.\nThe challenge, then, is not to establish new pedagogies for e-learning in the simple\nsense of coming up with new things to do with learners. Instead, this more compli-\ncated picture requires a more conservative approach: finding out what teachers do\nand why, and then working out how technology can best be used to support that. This\nis not to deny the importance of developing innovative teaching techniques; there is\ncertainly space in ALT-J for this, too. However, it is to call into question its relevance\nto the vast majority of teachers in higher education. If innovative research is all we do,\nwe run the risk of not connecting, of producing nothing that is relevant and meaning-\nful to their daily practices. It would be particularly ironic for our research to end up\nunread because we could not establish a connection.\n"}
