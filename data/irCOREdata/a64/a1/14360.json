The use of this format in an educational context for the\nmanipulation of, and interaction with, photographic images in electronic form is presented for the\nfirst time. Examples of courseware which use PhotoCD, image-enhancement and image-\nmanagement software in biology education are given, and an evaluation by undergraduates in\nbiology education (student teachers) of these teaching and learning strategies is presented\nPhotoCD: what is it?\nPhotoCD is a novel electronic format which uses digital technology to scan colour or\nmonochrome photographs, store them on compact discs, and then display them as high-\nquality images on a TV or on a monitor screen. A technical description of this technology\ncan be found in Beisner (1993), Bowers (1994) and Chen (1993). Supporting software is\navailable to access and manipulate the images for use in interactive learning.\nPhotoCD equipment and materials\nHardware\nA-PhotoCD player (Kodak PCD 5865) displays images directly from PhotoCD to TV or\nmonitor screen. The player can:\n\u2022 automatically display the images in sequence;\n\u2022 allow two, six or eight seconds' duration of display during an automatic slide-show\nsequence;\n\u2022 eliminate undesired images from the sequence (skip);\n\u2022 allow random access to images;\n\u2022 pan left and right across the screen image;\n62\nALT-J Volume 3 Number I\n\u2022 rotate the image in 90\u00b0 increments;\n\u2022 display a 2x enlargement of a part of any image; this is achieved by positioning a\nrectangular cursor on the required part of the image using four direction buttons on\nthe remote control unit;\n\u2022 remember the format of edited images;\n\u2022 restore edited images to their original format;\n\u2022 display a reduced version of the complete image;\n\u2022 play audio CDs at high-quality sound.\nA portable PhotoCD player (Kodak PCD 885) enables the system to be used in any\nteaching room, off-site for outside lectures, presentations etc., or to be taken home where\nit can be plugged in to a domestic TV set.\nA colour monitor (Philips 8833 Mkll 34cm CGA) gives higher-quality resolution than is\npossible with a standard TV for use by students in the classroom for individual or small-\ngroup learning.\nA microcomputer is used for DTP and image manipulation.\nSoftware\nAppropriate software, in addition to desktop publishing packages, is available to be used\nin conjunction with a computer and a suitable CD-ROM drive.\nPhotoCD Access (Kodak) allows images to be called onto the computer screen. It can be\nused to rotate, flip, crop, and cut-and-paste images into other applications. It allows\nmultiple versions of the same image to be opened.\nShoebox (Kodak) is an image-management program which creates thumbnail representa-\ntions of images. These are then used to create a flexible index using descriptive\ninformation for storage and retrieval. This graphical database application allows the user\nto search, count, mark, and display the digitized images stored on PhotoCD. It can also\nbe used to zoom, crop, copy and paste images into other applications, view a slideshow of\nimages, and store information from other formats. It is possible to print out any edited\ncontact sheet or individual image.\nPhotoEdge (Kodak) is an image-enhancement program which allows detail to be added\nor deleted from the image: exposure adjustment, sharpening and softening, colour\ncorrection, cropping, zooming and panning, and addition of arrows and script. It can be\nused to access PhotoCD images, display contact sheets, adjust brightness and contrast,\nand resize and rescale images.\nImages\nThe PhotoCD we used contained micrographs of ultrathin (>1 m) sections of animal cells\nand tissues taken at very high magnification (xl200 - <x20k) through an electron\nmicroscope (such instruments are used mainly for research, and these images were taken\n\u2014\nLinda Baggott and Bruce Wright Interactive learning in biology with PhotoCD\nfrom the authors' own work). Transfer to the PhotoCD format from 35mm monochrome\nslides was by commercial process via a high-street photographic retailer.\nWhy is PhotoCD important for biology education?\nObviously, PhotoCD is not uniquely suitable for biology education, but visual images are\nfundamentally important in the study of biology. Students' understanding of biological\nprocesses requires observation of suboptical structures and their related functions, and\nfirst-hand observation and experience traditionally is gained by using a microscope. An\nincrease in our understanding of biological function at the molecular level has occurred\nwith the development and refinement of microscope technology. With few exceptions,\nhowever, such instruments are funded by large research grants, and are rarely available\nfor the use of undergraduates. In circumstances where students are not specifically being\ntrained in microscopy, where, as is the case in many general or introductory courses,\nacquisition of overview or basic level of understanding is required by the course,\nPhotoCD is an affordable and flexible alternative.\nPractical applications of PhotoCD\nThere are many practical applications of PhotoCD, some of which we list below:\n\u2022 Illustration of teaching points during lectures, tutorials or seminars. Portable\nPhotoCD players, handset operated, can be used to display, highlight, enlarge or rotate\nselected images to illustrate teaching points.\n\u2022 Class interaction - students use the PhotoCD player in response to questioning, and in\ndiscussion.\n\u2022 Practical activities - students work at practical problems directly on the images.\nProgramming sequences of images, to demonstrate processes, measuring and\ncomparing structures, and other aspects of biometry relating structure to function are\nexamples of the use of PhotoCD in the study of microscopic preparations.\n\u2022 Presentations - students work together or individually to produce presentations of\ntheir work. Original photographs or photomicrographs, or sequences of these, can be\nincorporated into text images to communicate students' understanding.\n\u2022 Information retrieval - image management software is used to set up a visual database\nfor students to question, or to add to with further information about the images.\n\u2022 Supported self-study - individually, or in groups, students work at courseware which\nreinforces the subject matter of courses.\nPhotoCD and associated software as a learning medium on trial\nIt has been demonstrated that students' understanding of biological processes is achieved\nmore quickly when they use interactive learning technologies in conjunction with more\ntraditional teaching methods (Huang & Aloi, 1991; Baggott & Wright, 1994). The\nstrength of PhotoCD as a tool in teaching and learning lies in its application for freeing\n64\nALT-J Volume 3 Number I\nthe user from technical constraints, while allowing grasp of fundamental concepts. High-\nquality images can readily and repeatedly be studied at a relatively low cost.\nThe 26 students involved in our PhotoCD pilot study were biology education\nundergraduates at the University of Exeter, in the third year of a four-year course. These\nstudents are able to provide high-quality feedback on new learning formats as a result of\ntheir professional education combined with the variety of backgrounds from which they\ncome to the course: there is a wider age range than is usual in undergraduate courses, and\nmany come to teaching from other professions and occupations. In view of the fact that\nthey are obliged to acquire a breadth and depth of scientific knowledge as well as\nprofessional expertise in practice, methods of gaining an accurate overview while\nencouraging a spirit of enquiry are especially relevant for their education.\nExamples of courseware\nThe PhotoCD images were displayed on a monitor or computer-monitor screen, and the\nstudents worked at specific tasks relating to them. Various approaches were used in\nframing the tasks, but all required the students to make very close observations and to\nexercise their subject knowledge in discussion. The following are representative tasks\nusing the PhotoCD images and software:\nExamples of tasks involving use of a PhotoCD player\nWhat is this structure? (Image No. 4)\nWith reference to your lecture notes and course handbook, annotate the image with\ninformation not only about the visible structures, but also the physiological processes leading\nto and resulting from, its development.\nImage No. 4\nBrowse through images 20, 23, 43, 44, 45, 50, 56, to find a good example of a Golgi\n65\nLindo \u00dfoggott and Bruce Wri$it Interactive learning in biology with PhotoCD\napparatus. Use the zoom facility to magnify the organelle, and then make a labelled diagram\nof it, giving some indication of scale, and stating from which image it came.\nExamples of tasks involving the use of image-enhancement software (PhotoShop)\nIdentify an image which shows a micrograph ofoviductal epithelial tissue. Scan and print out\nan image with clear contrast and good definition. Label the features of particular functional\nsignificance for this tissue.\nScan and print out good copies of images 34 (oviduct) and 45 (epididymis). Compare and\nlabel the common features of these tissues. Annotate the copies to indicate the differences in\nfunction between the two tissues.\nExamples of tasks involving the use of image-management software (ShoeBox)\nSet up and print out a contact sheet containing images showing examples of a variety of\ntissues to be found in the mammalian female reproductive tract. Label each image, and\nprovide suitable explanatory captions.\nSearch the catalogue for an image showing a clear example ofoviductal epithelium. Print\nout the image, and annotate it to explain the function of the cell types contained in this\ntissue.\nStudent evaluation\nThere is a substantial academic component to the science education course at the\nUniversity of Exeter, part of which is a sixty-hour course on developmental biology. The\nPhotoCD materials were used during this course to reinforce the students' understanding\nof the microanatomy of the mammalian reproductive tract. Clearly, there is insufficient\ntime for such students to work directly from an electron microscope, and the study of\nelectron micrographs gives limited information.\nStudents were given a demonstration of use of the PhotoCD equipment, and were left\nwith written instructions for both hardware and software. They then worked through the\ncourseware in their own time in groups of two to four. None had had any prior\nexperience of working with an electron microscope: their study of biological specimens at\nthe ultrastructural level had been via text-book micrographs and diagrams. They were\nasked to give their reactions to the PhotoCD materials in terms of perceived advantages\nand disadvantages, and how their motivation for learning had been affected.\nAll responded positively about the user-friendliness of the hardware, and the\ndocumentation for use. They were impressed with the quality of resolution, and the ease\nwith they could move from image to image, pan, zoom and magnify. Some reported that\nwork with a light microscope was usually a solitary activity, and they appreciated the\ncollaboration and discussion which occurred when they worked together around a screen.\nThe most valuable outcome for many students, however, emerged from the tasks with the\nimage-enhancement software. There was a considerable sense of empowerment in taking\nhome an accurate record of a microscopic image which they had studied together, and\nwhich could be further labelled, annotated and filed for future reference. This was\n66\nALT-J Volume 3 Number I\nparticularly apparent when hard copies resulted from tasks which involved questioning\nthe database.\nThe majority of students (88%) felt that their interest in and enthusiasm for the subject\nhad been enhanced by using the PhotoCD materials. Some (7%) said that their motiva-\ntion had been unaffected, and 5% felt that as it was not 'the real thing', it was a pointless\nexercise.\nDiscussion\nOne skill which is traditionally practised in biology is drawing. Observation occupies a\nlarge proportion of the time spent in studying organisms, their structure, function and\ninter-relationships, and a key component of any scientific investigation is accurate\nrecording. Although drawing has almost entirely been superseded in biological research\nby photography, it is still highly valued by many biology educators as a means of\ndeveloping the skill of observation. However, it is a time-consuming skill to acquire, and\nrelies to some extent on a combination of prior experience and natural talent. The\ntraditional technique for drawing specimens from a microscope requires the observer to\nkeep the paper on the side of the drawing hand, use the opposite eye for the microscope\neyepiece, and keep both eyes open while looking from the specimen to the drawing (Jones\net al, 1994). This can be extremely tiring, and unless they can produce reasonably\naccurate drawings fairly quickly, it is probably an inappropriate use of time for\nundergraduate students. PhotoCD is a means of liberating them from this difficulty.\nA previous intervention study, in which the PhotoCD materials were used by half the\nstudents on a first-year cell biology course following a pre-test, demonstrated that the\npost-test scores of those students who used the PhotoCD materials showed a highly\nsignificant improvement over the scores of those who had not used the materials (Baggott\n& Wright, 1994b). The sample size in both case-studies was small, and other factors such\nas the background knowledge of the students, or the fact of having done extra study\nbecause of their involvement in the trial, may have affected the outcome of their work.\nNevertheless, in both intervention studies, the PhotoCD materials do appear to have\npositively affected either the learning of the students, or their motivation for learning.\nHowever, further detailed work is needed to make any assertive statements about the\nvalue of the materials for learning, and to elucidate the reasons for the improvement.\nAcknowledgements\nWe acknowledge with gratitude the enthusiasm and insight of our technical research\nassistant, Oenone Thomas.
