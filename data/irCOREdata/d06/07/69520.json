INTRODUCTION\nA. Overview of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)\nTHE future LHC project at CERN, Geneva, Switzer-land, will be a colliding proton synchrotron with a\ncenter-of-mass energy of 14 TeV. It is anticipated to deliver an\ninitial luminosity of cm s to two large general\npurpose detector experiments (ATLAS and CMS) and scale up\nto the full design luminosity of cm s . The high final\nstate particle multiplicities from the proton-proton collisions\nnecessitate highly granular and large scale detector systems pro-\nducing 1 to 2 MByte event sizes from electronic channels.\nThe bunch crossing rate of 40 MHz implies fast trigger and data\nacquisition (DAQ). When these factors are considered along\nwith the high radiation environment in which the detectors and\ntheir electronics must function for the decade-long lifetime of\nthe experiment, the LHC program places unprecedented and\nextreme demands on detectors and trigger\/DAQ systems.\nB. Atlas Detector\nThe ATLAS detector [2] consists of several highly granular\nand hermetic concentric subdetector systems oriented coaxially\nManuscript received June 5, 2003; revised February 18, 2004.\nThe authors are with ATLAS High-Level Trigger Group, PH Department,\nCERN, CH-1211 Geneva 23, Switzerland (e-mail: Steven.Armstrong@\ncern.ch).\nDigital Object Identifier 10.1109\/TNS.2004.828620\nwith respect to the LHC beamline and centered around the nom-\ninal proton-proton collision point. This subsection briefly sum-\nmarizes details of the detector relevant to the discussion below.\nThroughout this document, the LHC beamline is referred to as\nthe axis; kinematic variables such as transverse momentum\nare defined from this axis as is the polar angle\nfrom which pseudorapidity is derived.\nThree subdetector systems at the innermost radii consti-\ntute the Inner Detector (InDet) tracking system: the Pixel\ndetector, the Semiconductor Tracker (SCT), and the Transition\nRadiation Tracker (TRT). These detectors are immersed in\na 2 T axial magnetic field generated by a superconducting\nsolenoid magnet outside the TRT. By reconstructing hits\nleft from charged particles traversing the fiducial tracking\nvolume, high efficiency tracking with good impact parameter\nresolution can be achieved up to an absolute pseudorapidity\nof 2.5. The InDet provides a reconstruction efficiency greater\nthan 90% over a broad spectrum for isolated tracks with\nresolutions of (TeV ) and\n( m).\nA liquid Argon calorimeter (LAr) with an accordion-shaped\nelectrode design is situated outside the solenoid magnet and pro-\nvides electromagnetic calorimetery within with a res-\nolution of % % and a position\nresolution of . The LAr is segmented into\nthree longitudinal sections referred to as samplings. The first of\nthese samplings is equipped with narrow strips of mm in the\ndirection and aids in particle identification. Outside the LAr\nis a hadron calorimeter with a novel radial scintillating tile ge-\nometry (Tile) providing a resolution of %\n%. LAr technology is also used for hadron calorimetery in\nthe endcap regions as well as special forward calorimeters ex-\ntending the coverage to .\nOutside the calorimetry system is an air-core Barrel Toroid\n(BT) and Endcap Toroid (ECT) magnet system interleaved\nby, and surrounded with, several types of tracking chambers\ncomprising the Muon Spectrometer. The peak field intensities\nare 3.9 and 4.1 T in the BT and ECT respectively. There are\ntwo types of fast response chambers contributing to the Level-1\nTrigger decision:Thin Gap Chambers (TGC) and Resistive\nPlate Chambers (RPC). There are also two types of precision\ntracking chambers: Monitored Drift Tubes (MDT) and Cathode\n0018-9499\/04$20.00 \u00a9 2004 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

The muon spectrometer provides a\nstandalone momentum resolution of roughly 2%, allowing it to\nidentify muons up to 1 TeV\/ .\nThe physical size of the detector is defined by the outermost\nchambers of the muon spectrometer: 46 m long, with a diameter\nof 22 m. The overall mass of the detector is roughly kg.\nC. Trigger System\nThe ATLAS trigger system must accept the high 40-MHz\nbunch crossing frequency and reduce it to a manageable rate\nof roughly 200 Hz. It is comprised of a three-level system. The\nfirst-level hardware-based trigger (Level-1) quickly analyzes\ndata from the calorimeter and muon spectrometer systems to\nderive an accept or reject decision within 2 s. Events are\npassed on at a rate of 75 kHz to a second-level software-based\ntrigger (Level-2), which must derive a decision within an\naverage latency of 10 ms. Level-2-accepted events are passed\non at a rate of roughly 3 kHz to the third-level software-based\nEvent Filter (EF), which has a more generous latency of\nroughly 1 s to pass the event on to offline mass storage at a rate\nof roughly 200 Hz. It is axiomatic that only events surviving\nthis three-stage triggering system can be part of subsequent\nphysics analysis. Together, the Level-2 and EF are referred to\nas the High-Level Trigger (HLT) [3].\nTo achieve the required rejection power while retaining\nsensitivity to signal events within the broad ATLAS physics\nprogram, components of physics analysis traditionally deferred\nto offline environments must be embedded within the trigger\nsystem. Hence, the first stages of ATLAS physics analysis\nreside and must be understood within the online trigger system.\nTable I provides examples of physics objects, the corresponding\ntrigger element (TE) nomenclature for them, and the area of\nphysics analysis reliant upon them. The TEs denote and\ncharacterize abstract physics objects with a succinct label (e.g.,\n\u201ce20i\u201d for an isolated 20 GeV electron).\nII. ARCHITECTURE OF THE HIGH\u2013LEVEL TRIGGER SELECTION\nSOFTWARE (HLTSS)\nFig. 1 provides a disaggregated view of the key components\nof the HLTSSW. The HLTSSW runs on dedicated hardware con-\nsisting of farms of PCs interfaced to the ATLAS Data Collection\nSystems. For Level-2, the components of the HLTSSW must be-\nhave in a multithreaded-safe manner.\nA. HLT Algorithm Strategy\nAlgorithms reconstruct objects and extract features from\nevent data; these features are used to derive the trigger decision.\nAt Level-2, highly specialized algorithms use a restricted\nportion of event data usually defined in terms of Regions-of-In-\nterest (RoI) derived from the Level-1 decision. Modified\nalgorithms from the offline software are used as EF algorithms\nand have full access to event data. In both cases, algorithms\nmust be capable of being seeded from results derived at a\nprevious stage of the trigger chain. Furthermore, they may be\ncalled multiple times per event (e.g., in the case of multiple\nRoIs found at Level-1 in a single event). Hence, they do not\noperate in a general purpose mode as in the offline software, but\nTABLE I\nEXAMPLES OF PHYSICS OBJECTS, THE CORRESPONDING TRIGGER ELEMENT\nNOMENCLATURE, AND AREAS OF PHYSICS COVERAGE.

Event Data Model\nTo facilitate the importation of algorithms from the offline\nsoftware, as well as to permit a configurable continuum of selec-\ntion in the HLT by means of interchangeable Level-2 and EF al-\ngorithms, a common Event Data Model (EDM) is essential. The\nEDM is the common language within and between algorithms\ndefining the objectified representation of event data referred to\nas event data objects (EDOs). The establishment of a common\nEDM within the ATLAS offline and online software environ-\nments is an ongoing effort [4].\nIn the discussion below, relevant EDOs are as follows.\n\u2022 Clusters of hits within the Pixel(SCT) detector are\ntwo(one)-dimensional groups of neighboring readout\nchannels in a Detector Element.\n\u2022 Clusters are converted into three-dimensional\nSpacePoints which are used to determine a track\ndefining the trajectory of a charged particle.\n\u2022 Straw tubes in the TRT detector can measure the distance\nof ionization from its central wire by measuring the drift\ntime. These measurements are referred to as Drift-\nTimeHits. If the drift time is not available, a default\nspatial resolution given by the straw diameter divided by\nis used instead, and it is referred to as a StrawHit.\nThe TRT electronics has two independent thresholds for\nsignals; signals passing a higher threshold are likely to be\ndue to transition radiation and are referred to as TRHits.\n\u2022 A calorimeter Cell corresponds to the LAr readout gran-\nularity; this corresponds to a size of\n, and in Samplings 1, 2,\nand 3 respectively.\n\u2022 A calorimeter CaloCluster is a grouping of Cells\nin a window. The determination of the window\nsize for a CaloCluster is determined by studying con-\ntributions to the energy measurement from low-energy\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

A Cell\nwindow size in the second LAr Sampling is optimal for\nelectrons and converted photons with energies less than\n100 GeV [16].\nC. Importation of the Offline Software Framework\nIn addition to algorithms, the HLTSSW imports and uses\nkey components of the ATLAS object-oriented C++ Offline\nSoftware framework, referred to as Athena [5]. Within this\nframework, there is a separation of algorithmic objects from\nEDOs. The EDM specifies the nature and content of EDOs\nwhich are passed between algorithms and software packages\nvia a transient event store (TES). A corollary to this approach\nis that, contrary to canonical object-oriented programming,\ndata object classes contain minimal algorithmic content (e.g.,\nalgorithms for finding, following, or fitting tracks are separated\nfrom methods in the class definition of the Track itself).\nD. Restricted Data Access\nAt Level-2, algorithms actively request portions of event\ndata from the Data Collection System. The relevant data are\ndefined by RoIs based on information from the decision from\nLevel-1 or a previous result in Level-2 processing. For each\nRoI, the total data volume with respect to the whole detector is\nroughly a few percent. The number of RoIs is dependent upon\nthe RoI-type (e.g., electromagnetic, jets, etc.) and luminosity\nconditions, varying between 1 and 6 [6]. Hence, this restricted\ndata access strategy represents a significant reduction in the\nrequired HLT processing and networking resources.\nFor a given RoI, typically defined by an extent in and\nwithin the physical detector volume, a Region Selector [7]\ntranslates the physical volume into a set of offline identifiers\n[8]. These identifiers are translated at a subsequent stage (see\nSection II-E) into online identifiers which may then be used to\nrequest the data themselves.\nIt may seem counterintuitive to use such a scheme (i.e., con-\nversion into a geometrical region which requires translation into\nOffline identifiers which then require translation into Online\nidentifiers). There are, however, a variety of motivations for the\nRegion Selector. The prime motivation is to gain access in a uni-\nform and rapid way to event data from subdetectors which do\nnot participate in the Level-1 trigger decision (e.g., event data\nfrom InDet tracking information given a Level-1 trigger based\non an energy deposit in the Calorimeters). An additional moti-\nvation includes allowing for possible secondary RoIs as needed\nby an algorithm which may lie outside the primary RoI defined\nby Level-1.\nE. Paradigm for Realistic Raw Data Access\nRaw data from the ATLAS detector will be delivered in terms\nof a ByteStream of data consisting of hierarchically arranged\nfragments formatted in a subdetector-dependent way. This\nByteStream of data must be converted into EDOs which can\nthen be used by algorithms. Modeling this flow and conversion\nof ByteStream data in a realistic way is vital to an accurate\nmodeling of the HLT performance and subsequent estimation\nof required network and computing resources.\nThe HLTSSW adopts a scheme whereby the interaction of\nHLT algorithms with the Data Collection System is hidden\nbehind a call to the TES. Fig. 2 illustrates this scheme. An\nalgorithm requests data within a certain region by first feeding\nthe parameters of the region to the Region Selector. The Region\nSelector returns a set of Offline Identifiers which the algorithms\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library. Downloaded on May 1, 2009 at 10:50 from IEEE Xplore.

A simplified schematic diagram of the sequence by which HLT algorithms request and receive event data.\nthen uses to request collections of relevant EDOs from the\nTES. If the TES does not contain the EDOs, it requests these\ndata from a RawDataConverter. The Offline Identifiers are\ntranslated into Online or readout buffer (ROB) Identifiers which\nare used to request the data from the Data Collection System.\nTable II gives the current granularity of the ATLAS detector in\nterms of the number of Offline and ROB Identifiers used for\neach subdetector system. The raw data returned from the Data\nCollection System are in ByteStream format and are converted\ninto EDOs and stored in the TES in collections tagged with\nOffline Identifiers. The TES then returns the collections of\nEDOs the algorithm originally requested.\nF. Guidance and Seeding of Algorithms\nThe component of the HLTSSW which guides and steers\nalgorithms is referred to as the Steering [9]. The Steering\nallows a fast and early rejection of uninteresting events in a\nflexible and configurable manner; the Steering also permits the\npre-scale\/forced-accept of some events. This is realized in a\nway that permits full control of the algorithms executing within\nthe HLT processing flow by the modification of Extensible\nMarkup Language (XML) configuration files.\nThe Step Controller (SC) of the Steering software replaces\nthe application manager responsible within the offline software\nenvironment for iterating over events. Hence, the SC has the\nresponsibility of calling algorithms. Two XML files encode Se-\nquences and Signatures that in turn instruct the Steering when\nand how to run an algorithm and if a physics signature is ful-\nfilled. Signatures and Sequences are built upon TEs. This de-\ncouples the Steering from the details of the EDM. A Navigation\nscheme relates TEs to each other and to underlying concrete\nEDOs. Hence, a TE can be thought of as the entry point for an\nalgorithm into an event.\nThe HLT processing flow is disaggregated into Steps. Input\nTEs provide seeds to algorithms executing in each Step. The de-\ncision to go further in the process is taken at every new Step by\nTABLE II\nTHE CURRENT GRANULARITY OF THE ATLAS DETECTOR FOR EACH\nSUB-DETECTOR SYSTEM IN TERMS OF THE DEFINITION OF THE OFFLINE UNIT\nOF GRANULARITY (UNIT), NUMBER OF OFFLINE IDENTIFIERS (OFF. ID.),\nAND ONLINE ROB IDENTIFIERS ROB ID\nthe comparison between active TEs in the TES and the corre-\nsponding configuration Signature. An event is accepted if all its\nconstituent Sequences have been executed and at least one of\nthe corresponding configuration Signatures has been satisfied.\nIII. HLT ALGORITHMS\nThis section describes algorithms intended to be executed\nwithin the HLTSSW. An emphasis is placed on the more opti-\nmized and specialized algorithms developed for Level-2 which\nmust cope with more restrictive data access and latency.\nIn the case of Level-2 track reconstruction involving the\nprecision Pixel and SCT subdetectors, two parallel algorithms\nhave been developed: IDSCAN (described in Section III-A)\nand SiTrack (described in Section III-B). Likewise, in the case\nof Level-2 track reconstruction in the TRT subdetector, two\nparallel algorithms have also been developed: TRTxKalman\n(described in Section III-C) and TRT-LUT (described in\nSection III-D).

Level-2 Track Reconstruction: IDSCAN\nTaking as input SpacePoints found in the Pixel and SCT\nsubdetectors, the Level-2 tracking algorithm IDSCAN [3] con-\nsists of a series of subalgorithms: ZFinder, HitFilter,\nGroupCleaner, and TrackFitter.\n\u2022 The ZFinder finds the -position of the primary in-\nteraction vertex, which has a one standard deviation\nspreadqq of cm due to the LHC bunch size; this\ncomponent of the algorithm is described in detail in [10].\nAll SpacePoints are placed into narrow -bins and\npairs of SpacePoints in each bin are extrapolated\nback to the beam-axis, storing the of intersection in a\nhistogram. The -position is then the histogram region\nwith the most entries.\n\u2022 The HitFilter finds groups of SpacePoints\ncompatible with Tracks from the position found by\nZFinder; it is described in detail in [11]. It puts all\nSpacePoints into a histogram binned in and . It\nthen finds clusters of hits within this histogram. It creates\na group if such a cluster has SpacePoints in more\nthan a given number of layers.\n\u2022 The group found by HitFilter is used by Group-\nCleaner which splits groups into Tracks and removes\nnoise from groups. Each triplet of hits forms a potential\ntrack for which , and are calculated. It forms\ngroups from these triplets with similar parameters, ap-\nplying certain quality cuts. It accepts a track candidate if\na group contains enough hits.\n\u2022 Finally, the TrackFitter verifies track candidates and\ndetermines the track parameters using a standard Kalman-\nfilter-type fitting algorithm. It returns a list of Space-\nPoints on the Track, the Track parameters, and an error\nmatrix.\nB. Level-2 Track Reconstruction: SiTrack\nSiTrack [12] takes Pixel and SCT SpacePoints as input\nand provides fitted reconstructed Tracks, each containing links\nto the SpacePoints used to build it. SiTrack is implemented\nas a single main algorithm that executes a user defined list of\nsubalgorithms described below.\n\u2022 STSpacePointSorting collects pointers to Space-\nPoints coming from the Pixel and SCT detectors and\nsorts them by module address, storing the result in a Stan-\ndard Template Library (STL) map. This processing step is\nperformed in order to speed-up data access for the other\nreconstruction subalgorithms.\n\u2022 In the case of a trigger with a high- muon, the\nSTMuonVertex primary vertex identification algorithm\nis used and is most suitable for low luminosity events. It is\nbased on track reconstruction performed inside a Level-1\nmuon RoI: the most impulsive track is assumed to be the\nmuon candidate, and its impact parameter is taken as\nthe position of primary vertex position.\n\u2022 STTrackSeeding, using the sorted SpacePoint\nmap and a lookup table (LUT) linking each module within\nthe innermost Pixel layer (B-layer) to the ones belonging\nto other logical layers, builds track seeds formed by two\nSpacePoints and fits them with a straight line; one\nor more logical layers can be linked to the B-layer to\nimprove efficiency. If the primary vertex has already been\nreconstructed by STMuonVertex, a fraction of fake\ntrack seeds can be rejected during their formation with a\ncut on their distance from the primary vertex. Otherwise,\nif no vertex information is available, a histogram whose\nresolution depends on the number of seeds found is filled\nwith the impact parameter of each seed; its maximum\nis then taken as position for the primary vertex. This\nvertexing algorithm is most suitable for high luminosity\nevents containing many high tracks (e.g., b-tagging).\nIndependent cuts on and impact parameters are\neventually applied to the reconstructed seeds to further\nreduce the fake fraction.\n\u2022 STThreePointFit extends track seeds with a third\nSpacePoint; it uses a map associating to each seed a\nset of module roads. Here, a road is a list of modules or-\ndered according to the radius at which they are placed\nstarting from the innermost one. A track may have hits\nin the Pixel or SCT detectors. A subset of modules is ex-\ntracted from each road according to a user-defined param-\neter related to their depth inside it (e.g., the user can de-\ncide to use modules at the beginning or in the middle of\neach road, etc.). SpacePoints from the selected mod-\nules are then used to extend the seed and candidate tracks\nare fitted with a circle; ambiguities (e.g., tracks sharing at\nleast one SpacePoint) can be solved on the basis of the\ntrack quality, leading to an independent set of tracks that\ncan be used for trigger selection or as a seed for further\nextrapolation.\nC. Level-2 Track Reconstruction: TRTxKalman\nTRTxKalman utilizes StrawHits and DriftTimeHits\nfrom the TRT to reconstruct Tracks. The core of the algorithm\nis based upon a Hough-transform and borrows a set of utilities\nfrom the offline reconstruction package xKalman [13].\nPattern recognition is performed in a two-dimensional\nspace for the TRT barrel (endcap). A lower bound of\n0.5 GeV\/ is applied to permit straight-line approximations to\nbe used for particle trajectories. The trajectory of a particle with\nan initial azimuthal angle , longitudinal position , electric-\ncharge , in a uniform magnetic field (in Tesla) oriented\nparallel to the beam-axis , can be approximated as\nin the projection, and in the\nprojection. Here and\nare the transverse and longitudinal curvatures, and\n. However, the axial magnetic field in the InDet\ndeviates significantly from uniformity for m; hence,\na fourth-order Runge-Kutta method is used to calculate particle\ntrajectories in these regions.\nThe pattern recognition occurs in the following steps.\n\u2022 Using a Hough transformation, a histogram binned in\nterms of and (or ) is filled with positions of\nStrawHits within an RoI. In this parameter space, each\nStrawHit can occupy many positions. Track candidates\nare identified from peaks in the histogram.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

This procedure is described in detail in [13].\n\u2022 Tracks must satisfy quality criteria on the number of\nunique hits and ratio of hits to number of straws crossed.\nEach track contains a link to the number of TRHits\nwhich may also be used for electron identification at\nLevel-2.\nD. Level-2 Track Reconstruction: TRT-LUT\nTRT-LUT [14] is an algorithm for track reconstruction in the\nTRT. The algorithm takes as input StrawHits within an RoI\nand provides Track candidates and their parameters as well as\nthe StrawHits used for each Track; work is underway to in-\ncorporate DriftTimeHits into this algorithm.\nThe algorithmic processing consists of initial track finding,\nlocal maximum finding, track splitting, and track fitting and\nfinal selection.\n\u2022 Initial Track Finding: every StrawHit in a three-dimen-\nsional representation of the TRT is allowed to belong to a\nnumber of possible predefined tracks characterized by dif-\nferent parameters. All such tracks are stored in a lookup\ntable (LUT). Every StrawHit increases the probability\nthat a track is a genuine candidate by one unit.\n\u2022 Local Maximum Finding: a two-dimensional histogram is\nfilled with bins in and for the track parameters at\nthe primary vertex ( denotes the electric-charge sign).\nA histogram for a single track consists of a \u201cbow-tie\u201d-\nshaped region of bins with entries at a peak in the center\nof the region. The bin at the peak of the histogram will,\nin an ideal case, contain all the StrawHits from the\nTrack. The roads corresponding to other filled bins share\nStrawHits with the peak bin, and thus contain subsets\nof theStrawHits from the track. A histogram for a more\ncomplex event would consist of a superposition of entries\nfrom individual tracks. Hence, bins containing a complete\nset of StrawHits from each track can be identified as\nlocal maxima in the histogram.\n\u2022 Track Splitting: the pattern of StrawHits associated to\na track candidate is analyzed. By rejecting fake candidates\ncomposed of StrawHits from several low- tracks,\nthis step results in an overall reduction in the number of\ntrack candidates by roughly a factor of two. For roads con-\ntaining a good track candidate, it identifies and rejects any\nadditional StrawHits from one or more other tracks.\nThis results in a candidate that consists of a subset of the\nStrawHits within a road.\n\u2022 Track Fitting and Final Selection: to improve the mea-\nsurement of and over that of a simple straight-line\nfit, a fit is performed in the plane for the barrel\n(end-caps) using a third-order polynomial. This is given\nas where if the elec-\ntric-charge and is the curvature. The track is assumed\nto come from the nominal origin. After the fit, a recon-\nstructed threshold of 0.5 GeV\/ is applied.\nE. Level-2 Calorimetry: T2CALO\nT2Calo [15] is a clustering algorithm for electromag-\nnetic (EM) showers. It is seeded by Level-1 electromagnetic\n(EM) trigger RoI positions. This algorithm takes calibrated\ncalorimeter Cells as input and provides discriminating\nvariables to separate isolated EM objects from jets using\nmeasurements and shower-shape quantities.\nThe first step of T2Calo is the refinement of the Level-1 po-\nsition with the use of the position of the highest energy Cell\nin the second sampling of the EM calorimeter. The position\nof the highest energy Cell is later refined by calcu-\nlating the energy weighted CaloCluster position in\na window of in the second sampling.\nAfter the first step, the algorithm proceeds to calculate each of\nthe following variables and permits at each stage the application\nof selection criteria.\n\u2022 In the second sampling, the quantity\nis calculated. The expression stands\nfor the energy deposited in a window of around\n. This shape variable exploits the fact that most\nof the energy of EM showers is deposited in the second\nsampling of the EM calorimeter.\n\u2022 In the first sampling, the quantity\nis obtained in a window of\naround . and\nare the energies of the two highest local maxima found,\nobtained on a strip-by-strip basis. The two -bins are\nsummed and only the distribution in is considered. A\nlocal maximum is defined as a single strip with an energy\ngreater than its two adjacent strips.\n\u2022 The total transverse energy deposited in the EM\ncalorimeter is calculated in a window of Cells\naround .\n\u2022 Finally, the energy that leaks into the hadron calorimeter\nis calculated in a window of size\naround .\nF. Level-2 Muon Reconstruction: muFast\nThe muFast [17] algorithm is a Level-2 track reconstruction\nalgorithm for the Muon Spectrometer. The algorithm is seeded\nby the Level-1 muon RoI and uses both RPC and MDT measure-\nments. At present, this algorithm is limited to the barrel region\nand functions in the following sequence:\n\u2022 an emulation of the Level-1 muon trigger is performed to\nextract RPC hits that induced the Level-1 trigger accept\ndecision;\n\u2022 pattern recognition is performed using RPC hits to define\na road in the MDT chambers around a putative muon tra-\njectory. MDT tubes lying within the road are selected, and\na contiguity algorithm is applied to remove background\nhits not associated with the muon trajectory;\n\u2022 a straight-line track fit is made to the selected tubes (one\nper each tube monolayer) within each MDT station; for\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Event Filter Algorithms\nEvent filter algorithms consist of algorithms imported\ndirectly from those developed in the offline software; they are\ndescribed in detail elsewhere [3], [18]. Two complementary\nInDet track reconstruction packages are used: xKalman++\n[13] and iPatRec [19]. The package egammaRec is designed\nto combine tracking information with information from\nCaloClusters found by the two dedicated algorithms for\nreconstructing CaloClusters in the LAr and Tile calorime-\nters: the LArClusterRec and TileRec packages, respectively.\nA track reconstruction package for the Muon Spectrometer,\nMoore(Muon Object Oriented REconstruction) uses collections\nof digits or clusters from the MDT chambers in the Muon\nSpectrometer to find and fit tracks [20].\nIV. PERFORMANCE STUDIES\nThis section presents an assessment of the physics perfor-\nmance of the trigger algorithms for Level-2 and EF described\nin Section III and applied to two representative classes of final-\nstates: electrons and photons; and muons. Relevant aspects of\nsystem performance are also mentioned in each of the two fol-\nlowing subsections.\nA. Electrons and Photons\nThe inclusive electron and photon triggers are expected to\ncontribute a substantial fraction of the total high- trigger rate.\nAfter the selection by Level-2 and the EF, the remaining rate will\ncontain a significant contribution from Standard Model physics\nprocesses containing real isolated electrons or photons.\nAt Level-1, electrons and photons are selected using\ncalorimeter information with reduced granularity. After re-\nceiving the Level-1 electromagnetic (EM) trigger RoI positions,\nFig. 3. The Level-2 muon reconstruction efficiency (with respect to Level-1)\nusing the standalone algorithm muFast combined with Inner Detector tracks at\nan LHC luminosity of 1\u0002 10 cm s . A lower p threshold of 6 GeV\/c is\nrequired for muon candidates at Level-2.\nthe Level-2 trigger performs a selection of isolated EM clusters\nusing the full calorimeter granularity within an RoI of size\n. As described in Section III-E, elec-\ntrons and photons are selected based on EM cluster and\nshower-shape quantities that distinguish isolated EM objects\nfrom jets. A further, more refined calorimeter-based selection\nmay classify the EM cluster as a candidate photon trigger\nobject. In the next step, electrons are identified by associating\nthe EM cluster with a track in the InDet. In general, track\ncandidates are found by independent searches in the TRT and\nSCT\/Pixel detectors in the region identified by the Level-1 RoI.\nFor the results presented in the next section, however, only\nIDSCAN (Section III-A), has been used; work is in progress\nto evaluate the other algorithms. For electron candidates, a\nmatching of position and momentum measurements between\nthe track and the cluster is required. Electron candidates passing\nthe Level-2 selection criteria are retained to be examined by\nthe EF.\nIn the EF, electrons are selected with a strategy similar\nto that for Level-2 using information from the calorimeters\nand the InDet. For track reconstruction, results obtained with\nxKalman++ (Section III-G) are presented below; work is\nin progress to evaluate the alternative track reconstruction\nprogram iPatRec (Section III-G). First results show similar\nbehavior between these two algorithms. The main differences\nwith respect to Level-2 arise from the availability of calibration\ndata and the possibility to use more sophisticated reconstruc-\ntion algorithms with access to the detector data for the full\nevent. This results in sharper thresholds and better background\nrejection. In order to avoid biases introduced by using different\nreconstruction algorithms for online and offline selection, the\nEF will select events using the offline reconstruction algorithms\nto the largest possible extent. However, using the offline re-\nconstruction in the EF implies that the offline algorithms must\ncomply with the stricter EF requirements in terms of robustness\nand system performance.\nThe performance of the electron and photon triggers has been\nestimated for single electrons and photons, and for some stan-\ndard physics channels (e.g.,\n). The physics performance is characterized in terms\nof efficiency for the signal channel, and the rate expected for the\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Currently, only single electron triggers are studied.\nRate and efficiencies are presented for each step of the Trigger\nprocess in Table III. Further details of similar studies can be\nfound in [3].\nStudies of the system performance of algorithms and associ-\nated components of the HLTSSW described in Section II are\ncurrently underway. Preliminary studies have been conducted,\nand, for Level-2 algorithms, may be disaggregated along the\nsequence presented in Fig. 2. In each case, the computation\ntime needed is expressed in terms of execution speed on\na personal computer with a CPU speed of between 1 and\n2 GHz. The Region Selector (Section II-E) requires less than\n1 ms\/RoI\/subdetector. The access to data via the ROB Data\nCollector requires on the order of 100 s. Within an RoI low\nluminosity, the conversion of raw data ByteStream into EDOs\ncurrently requires roughly 5, 4, and 6 ms for the SCT\/Pixel,\nLAr, and Muon Spectrometer subdetectors, respectively. To\nprocess data within Level-2 algorithms for the electron and\nphoton selection is at maximum on the order of a few mil-\nliseconds. Hence, all components perform adequately within\nthe 10 ms average Level-2 latency extrapolated to an 8-GHz\nCPU with the exception of the raw data conversion. Work is\ncurrently in progress to reduce this time to an acceptable level;\npreliminary results are encouraging.\nB. Muons\nThe muon trigger selection strives to accurately reconstruct\nmuon tracks within RoIs indicated by the Level-1 muon trigger.\nLevel-2 and the EF must reject low- muons (i.e., muons with\nbelow the threshold that are initially selected due to the\nLevel-1 limited resolution), secondary muons produced by de-\ncays-in-flight of charged pions and kaons, and fake muon tracks\ncomposed of hits from the cavern background.\nThe tracks found in the Level-2 muon trigger are extrapo-\nlated and combined with measurements from the InDet and the\ncalorimeters. Matching between muon tracks measured inde-\npendently in the muon system and the InDet selects prompt\nmuons and rejects fake and secondary muons. Using the Level-2\nmuFast algorithm (Section III-F), a muon resolution of 4%\nis obtained. Fig. 3 shows the efficiency reconstruction as a func-\ntion of for prompt muons as well as secondary muons from\nand decays-in-flight.\nV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\nThe future LHC at CERN offers unprecedented challenges\nto the design and construction of detectors and trigger\/DAQ\nsystems. For ATLAS, a three-level trigger system has been de-\nveloped to extract interesting physics signatures with a rate\nreduction. To accomplish this, components of physics analysis\ntraditionally deferred to offline physics analysis will be em-\nbedded within the online trigger system.\nA dedicated and specialized selection software framework\nhas been designed for the HLT. Algorithms will operate within\nthis framework and must cope with data access and latency lim-\nitations. Further development and tests of this model along with\na broad suite of algorithms using a realistic raw data access par-\nadigm are underway.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nWe wish to acknowledge and thank the ATLAS Offline Soft-\nware community for their many contributions to the high-level\ntrigger selection software framework, as well as high-level\ntrigger algorithms.
