However, little is known about how, \nexactly, games achieve these motivational qualities. \nFurthermore, there are very few practical recommendations \nmade on how to recreate the motivation seen in \nentertainment games when designing educational games.  \nMost literature that has been published on the design of \ngames for education is purely descriptive and discusses why \ngames should be good learning tools, rather than what can \nbe done to make sure that they are. Perhaps as a \nconsequence, the majority of educational games can be \ndescribed as chocolate-covered broccoli [9] neither fun, nor \nof educational benefit. \nThe intention of this paper is to provide a clear, practical \nframework for designing engaging game mechanics in \neducational games, based on the successful, empirically \nvalidated teaching methods developed by behavioural \npsychologists. We are motivated by the findings that whilst \nthere is very little evidence of computer games \noutperforming traditional teaching methods in terms of \ncontributing towards students successfully achieving \neducation outcomes, there is a great deal of evidence of \nbehavioural teaching programmes doing so.  Crucially, the \nmethods that computer games designers and behavioural \npsychologists have developed for teaching appear very \nsimilar to each other in many ways. Both computer games \nand behavioural teaching programmes are approaches to \neducation that reject the traditional lecture format and use \nnovel, creative methods of structuring the education \nprocess, centred on personalised instruction.   \nIn this paper we will first introduce the argument for using \ngames as educational tools and the problems that are \ninherent in doing so.  We will then discuss the processes \ninvolved in designing engaging computer games, before \naddressing the problem of merging the disparate goals of \neducation and game design. We will then suggest that \nApplied Behaviour Analysis (ABA), the method of teaching \ndeveloped by behavioural psychologists, can provide a \nfoundation for the design of educational games, while \nmaintaining those aspects of entertainment games that are \n \nNote: This is the author\u2019s version of the work.

We will conclude by providing \na step-by-step guide in designing an educational game on \nthe basis of ABA. \nGAMES AS TOOLS FOR EDUCATION \nStudent motivation is a key predictor of successful \neducational outcomes [38,39].  Indeed, one of the most \nbasic and important predictors of student achievement is the \namount of time a student spends engaged in learning (or \ntime-on-task; [1,27,20,57]). Traditional mainstream \neducation has been criticised by many as being poor at \nmotivating all but a small minority of learners [55].  Much \ncriticism has been directed towards the lecture-based \nstructure that is still ubiquitous in educational institutions \ntoday [45,48]. Critics have typically asserted that the \nprimary advantage of the lecture format is economical \nrather than pedagogical [41]. What appears to be needed is \na medium that provides similar cost-effectiveness as the \nlecture format, but with the ability to retain rather than \nalienate learners [41]. \nVideo games have emerged as a technology that specialises \nin, and is hugely successful at, engaging and motivating \nusers to spend time-on-task [15,22,41]. It is clear that \npeople are highly motivated to engage in these games [48].  \nIn addition to the apparent motivational qualities of \ncomputer games, many have commented on how learning is \nan essential part of successfully playing a game \n[22,23,30,48]. Indeed, it could be argued that all \ncommercial games are educational, as they train players to \nlearn the skills needed for gaining success within that game.  \nEssentially, it seems that games designers have hit on \nprofoundly successful methods of getting people to learn \nand to enjoy learning [22,30].  \nGiven that games specialise in engendering motivation, are \nhugely popular and already require players to learn, it \nshould be no surprise that the creation of games that \nprovide some form of learning experience for the player has \nbeen proposed.  Educational games appear to offer the \npotential to improve learner motivation, time-on-task and, \nconsequently, learning outcomes. \nExisting games are not particularly successful \nWhile it seems apparent that games have the potential to \nfunction as valuable teaching tools, there is very little \nevidence that they 1) produce reliable, valid and long-\nlasting educational outcomes, or 2) do so better than \ntraditional education structures. There is very little \nempirical work published that investigates the educational \npotential of games in any rigorous manner, and less still \nthat measures the learning outcomes of games compared to \nother teaching methods [41].  Indeed, review articles \n[15,44] tend to focus on pointing out reasons why games \nhave the potential to constitute valuable learning tools, \nrather than reviewing any empirical evidence.   \nO\u2019Neill et al. [46] conducted a thorough review of articles \npublished on educational computer games in the previous \n15 years.  They found that, despite the thousands of articles \navailable, only 19 presented a rigorous quantitative or \nqualitative analysis of educational outcomes from computer \ngames.  Of those 19 articles, findings regarding the \neducational benefits of games were mixed, which echoes \nthe findings of other commentators [14,24,49]. \nFurthermore, in cases where positive educational outcomes \nhave been found, it is possible that these can be attributed to \nthe instructional design of the educational programme and \nnot to games as a medium (see [12] for a discussion on this \npoint). O\u2019Neill et al., conclude that, \u201cthe evidence of \npotential is striking, but the empirical evidence for \neffectiveness of games as learning environments is scant\u201d \n(p. 468).  \nIt is important to note that although reviews have pointed to \na lack of convincing evidence for games as educational \ntools, this does not mean that there haven\u2019t been any games \nthat have produced positive educational outcomes.  For \nexample, Lee et al. [31] found that students completed 3 \ntimes as many maths problems over 19 days using a \ncomputer game than they normally did using just \nworksheets.  McLean et al. [43] found favourable results for \ngames in comparison to other teaching methods, across a \nrange of games that taught subjects as diverse as geology \nand biology.  A randomised control trial of a diabetes-\nmanagement game was found to reduce hospital visits for \nchildren aged 8-16 who played it [32].  Indeed, every month \nthere are growing numbers of studies that demonstrate how \ngames can facilitate learning. \nHowever, despite this growing evidence base, it is \nquestionable whether any greater level of understanding on \nhow to best produce learning outcomes through game-based \nteaching programmes is being generated.  Without a solid \ntheoretical framework through which to design studies and \ninterpret results, it is very difficult to differentiate which \nelements of a successful game were essential in producing \nthose successful outcomes and which were not necessary.   \nFactors that predict effectiveness of educational games \nGiven the apparent consensus that games should be \neffective tools for education, and, further, that some studies \nhave found positive effects for games on educational \noutcomes, it is surprising to discover that there have been \nvery few concrete, empirically validated suggestions on \nhow to design successful educational games \n[15,21,24,41,44,46]. In fact, a large number of factors have \nbeen suggested as potentially important, but few have been \ndemonstrated conclusively.  For example, commentators \nhave suggested that factors such as fun [2], flow, \nengagement [30], feedback [40, 41], goals [15, 56], \nproblem solving [23], game balance and pacing [23], \ninteresting choices [51] and fantasy narrative [38,39], \namong many others are essential to the success of a game.  \nIndeed, perhaps the most influential book in the field of \neducational gaming [22] mentions 36 possible ways that \npeople can learn from games.  What is missing is the \nevidence of components that do reliably predict successful \noutcomes.   \nOne exception to this analysis appears to lie in the concept \nof Intrinsic Learning ([25]; also referred to as procedural \nrhetoric [8]). Intrinsic learning requires the embedding of \nlearning outcomes of a teaching programme within the \nmechanics of a game. It appears crucial that the task learned \nin the game maps directly on to the challenge faced in the \nreal world. Habgood [25] investigated experimentally the \nimportance of integrating learning content with the \nmechanics of a game. Specifically, in two studies, he found \nthat a game in which learning was intrinsic to game play \nwas motivationally and educationally more effective than \nan almost identical game in which learning was not intrinsic \nto game play. Thus it appears that we have at least one \ncoherent, experimentally verified rule for designing \neducational games; a successful educational game must \nintegrate the learning with the game play mechanics, rather \nthan as an addition to the game play mechanics. \nIn summary, while it may prove useful for games designers \nto give suggestions on game features that enhance \nengagement, if they are not specific enough to test \nempirically they are of very little use to other designers.  \nWhat is necessary in order to advance the understanding of \nhow to build successful educational games is a rigorous \nframework for defining parameters that can be \nexperimentally validated.  We propose that applied \nbehaviour analysis (ABA; [13]) may form an ideal \nframework for both guiding the design of educational \ngames and conducting the basic research on how to teach \nsuccessfully via games. \nDESIGNING COMPUTER GAMES  \nOne of the key mistakes made by educational games \ndesigners lies in focusing too heavily on educational \ncontent to the detriment of the gameplay [25]. The reason \nwhy games have been proposed as good educational tools is \nthat they are seen as intrinsically motivating.  However, that \ndoes not mean that everything which is called a game, or \nlooks like a game, will have those motivating qualities.  \nSimply translating a standard textbook-style educational \nprogramme into a point-and-click computer programme, \ndoes not constitute game design. Rather, a similar approach \nmust be taken to designing an educational game as that is \ntaken to entertainment games. \nIn order to build a successful educational game, it is crucial \nto understand what is involved in designing a traditional \ncomputer game.  From a review of the literature on game \ndesign [7,30,36,51] the following features appear important \nto most games: \nGames typically present the player with a series of short, \nmedium and long-term goals. Indeed, Swartout and van \nLent [56] found that goals of different levels help motivate \nlearners to continue playing. \nGames typically require the player to take some actions or \ndecisions in order to reach those goals [51]. \nGames typically excel at providing immediate, appropriate \nand specific feedback to players.  This feature is at the heart \nof the motivation, sustained attention, learning and fun \nexperienced by game players [36,40,41]. \nGames often have a complex system for presenting players \nwith rewards for achievement.  \nGames methodically teach players the skills needed to meet \ncomplex challenges.  Long, complex tasks are broken down \ninto short, simple components.  These components are \ntrained individually before being chained together \n[22,23,30]. \nGenerally, players are expected to demonstrate excellent \nperformance of a skill before they can advance to using that \nskill in a more challenging environment.  Complex tasks, \nthen, simply require the chaining together of these \npreviously learned simple skills. \nWhere games present the player with options for taking \naction, no one action should be obviously correct, while \nothers are obviously incorrect [22,30,48,51]. \nTable 1: List of features seen in most entertainment games. \nOf course, this list is in no way exhaustive, and including \nthese seven features will not guarantee a successful game.  \nHowever, these features are observed in a lot of successful \nentertainment games, thus implying that they are useful in \nthe engendering and maintaining of player motivation. So, \nwhen designing educational games, it appears important to \ntake a pedagogical approach that allows for the inclusion of \nthose features.   \nINTEGRATING THE GOALS OF EDUCATION AND GAME \nDESIGN \nIn order to design successful educational games we need to \nadopt an educational framework that is both successful and \ncongruent with the goals of game design. We also need a \nmethod of instruction that takes greatest advantage of the \nbenefits that medium of computer games offer; their ability \nto teach in a one-to-one manner, to adapt to the \nperformance of each individual player, to deliver timely and \nspecific feedback to players in a controlled manner, and to \nmotivate players of a wide range of knowledge or skill \nlevels.  We propose that Applied Behaviour Analysis \n(ABA), as a framework, fulfills all of these requirements. \nABA programmes, such as Precision Teaching [33,34,35], \nDirect Instruction [16], and the Personalized System of \nInstruction [28] are methods for teaching based on the \nfindings of behavioural science.   They are typically \ndelivered on a one-to-one basis and reject the lecture \nformat, relying on the teacher more as a coach. They are \n designed on the assumption that learning is maximised \nwhen high performance targets are set and teaching is \nfocused on the individual. Indeed, unlike in traditional \neducation, the passing criterion in behavioural education is \nnot 40%, but typically somewhere around 90%. If the \nlearner does not reach this stringent passing criterion, they \nare required to repeat the programme until they do reach it.  \nABA programmes are highly successful \nThere has been a great deal of empirical support for the \neffectiveness of behavioural teaching programmes.  Indeed, \nthey have been extremely successful wherever \nimplemented, from university modules [52] to secondary \nschool, [45] primary school [33,34], driver education \nprogrammes [4] and challenging populations [11].   \nBehavioural teaching methodologies have been particularly \nsuccessful as early interventions for children diagnosed \nwith autistic spectrum disorders [37].   \nDespite the empirical evidence for the effectiveness of \nbehavioural teaching methods, they have not yet been \nwidely adopted within mainstream education in any country \nto date.  A number of suggestions (i.e., [4,35,45,52]) have \nbeen put forward to explain this situation.  For example, \neducators may be hesitant to adopt instructional methods \nthat are contrary to traditional pedagogical systems or are \ndifficult to fit into the traditional academic calendar [52].  \nBehavioural strategies require substantial planning, \npreparation of resources and training, which many \neducators have been unwilling to undertake [4].   \nOne of the core barriers to acceptance, according to \nLindsley [35], is the focus on repetition and discipline \nwithin behaviour methodologies and how these don\u2019t fit \nwell with current views commonly held by educators that \nlearning should be fun.  He draws a comparison between \nthe attitudes of educators and those who coach in athletics \nand the performing arts.  \u201cIt is amazing that educators and \nthe public accept the need for disciplined regular daily \npractice in the performing arts and in athletics, yet reject it \nin academics.\u201d \nCrucially, computer games appear ideally suited to \ncircumvent a large number of the factors that are holding \nback the uptake of these highly effective teaching \nprogrammes in mainstream education.  The use of computer \ngames require little extra training for the teacher, since a \nwell designed game itself teaches the user how to play it. \nGames can be fit within the traditional academic timetable, \nthey require no resources other than the game itself, and \nthey motivate players to engage in exactly the type of \ndisciplined, repetitive rehearsal that Lindsley [35] \nsuggested as crucial to success in education. \nABA is similar in structure to games \nABA programmes, have structures that resemble computer \ngames in important ways. For example, in a Precision \nTeaching programme [33,35], the teacher defines each \nindividual target behaviour that the student needs to \nimprove on. They also define a target frequency of that \nbehaviour, and clearly state the rewards for reaching that \ntarget. For example, the goal may be to answer forty 12-\ntimes-tables problems in a 30 second period. The student \npractices the behaviour until the specified target is met. \nOnce performance targets have been met, the student \nobtains the pre-defined reward and the teacher sets a new \ntask. Students record their own performance under \nsupervision of teachers on specially designed charts.  From \nviewing these charts, students have constant access to \nfeedback on their performance relative to previous sessions.  \nInterestingly, highly engaging games typically have clearly \nspecified and measurable goals (such as to level-up), \nrequire a great deal of repetition of skills in order to reach \nthat goal (fighting numerous similar enemies), are often \nconducted under time constraints, have clearly specified \nrewards for reaching the specified goal (stronger \nplayer\/more weapons\/access to new levels) and provide \nconstant feedback from the game state on how successfully \nthe player is performing.  The similarities to behavioural \nteaching programmes are striking. In addition, successful \ngames pay a great deal of attention to the rate in which \ncomplexity is increased over the course of game levels and \nto the balance and pacing of player advancement through \nthese levels.  These issues of rates, balance and pacing \nappear to precisely parallel the process that the behaviour \nanalyst undertakes in defining larger programmes for \nstudents.   \nHas this approach to educational games been \nundertaken before? \nSome researchers have already adapted and used games \nwithin behavioural education programmes.  For example, \nFoxx et al. [19] adapted a commercially available board \ngame to train social and vocational skills to \ndevelopmentally delayed adults.  The game contingencies \nincreased social\/vocational skills in all targeted areas. \nMedland and Stachnik [42] successfully used a game to \nimprove the classroom behaviour of fifth grade students.  \nThe game reduced the dependent measures from their \nbaseline rate by almost 99% for one group and 97% for the \nother.  Bay-Hinitz, Peterson and Quiltich [3] used co-\noperative games to modify the aggressive and co-operative \nbehaviours of young children.  Cooperative behaviour \nincreased and aggression decreased during cooperative \ngames and these behaviours generalised to subsequent free-\nplay sessions.   \nIt appears that behaviour modification and teaching \nprogrammes can, and have, been delivered effectively via \ngames.  Indeed, Bay-Hinitz [3] point out that there is a \npractical advantage to delivering behavioural interventions \nvia games; \u201cinstructing children in the use of particular \ngames is a simple strategy, particularly when compared to \ntraining a teacher to carry out a specific treatment plan \nusing contingent reinforcement for certain responses\u201d (p. \n445). However, these findings have made little impact on \nthe field of educational games in general.  \nIn summary, it appears that ABA programmes are both \nhighly successful methods for teaching, and also resemble \ngames in a number of important ways. In fact ABA \nprogrammes appear ideally suited to taking advantage of \nthe benefits that the medium of computer games offer; they \nexcel in teaching in a one-to-one manner, they are adaptive \nto the performance of each individual learner, they are \nbased on delivering timely and specific feedback to learners \nin a controlled manner, and they have been used to motivate \nplayers of a wide range of knowledge or skill levels.  As \ngames and ABA programmes appear to share all of these \nimportant features, it should be possible to build games \nbased on ABA principles without losing the motivation \ntypically elicited by entertainment games. \nABA AND THE DESIGN OF EDUCATIONAL GAMES \nIn this section will attempt to explain some basic steps \ntaken by behaviour analysts in designing educational \nprogrammes, and point out how they can be implemented in \nthe design of educational computer games.  The steps \npresented below should, on their own, be enough to \nimprove the chances of games genuinely helping learners to \nachieve their learning outcomes.  These steps can be broken \ninto three categories; a) defining and measuring behaviour, \nb) recording and analysing behaviour change, c) presenting \ncorrective feedback, and d) dynamically adapting to student \nperformance. \nDefining and measuring behaviour \nSelecting and defining target behaviours \nThe most basic and important step in the design of any \neducational programme is to clearly define the intended \nlearning outcomes of that programme.  These outcomes \nmust be defined as clearly, objectively observable \nbehaviours, and it must be possible to provide a specific \ndefinition of when a learner has and has not reached that \nlearning outcome. For example, rather than an outcome of \n\u2018knowledge of 12-times tables\u2019 it should be defined as, the \nability to solve any twenty randomly presented 12-times \ntables problems in a 30 second window. This definition is \ntestable and is possible for a computer to evaluate as correct \nor not. \nSimilarly to the concept of intrinsic learning suggested by \ngames designers [8,25], behaviour analysts insist that the \n\u201cbehaviour chosen \u2026. must be the behaviour in need of \nimprovement, not a similar behaviour that serves as a proxy \nfor the behaviour of interest,  or the subjects verbal \ndescription of the behaviour\u201d ([13], p.16).  So, whether or \nnot participants have reached a learning outcome should not \nbe judged by their answers to a questionnaire (unless the \nlearning outcome is to improve the learners ability to \nanswer questionnaires). Rather,  whether they have reached \nthat learning outcome or not should be observable from the \naction of the player as they are playing.  \nEssentially, instruction should not be designed as blocks of \nplay and tests. The play, itself, should be the behaviour that \nis examined. This is especially important in a computer \ngame, where a teacher is not present to interpret behaviour. \nSo, if the game has been designed to teach industrial \nchemistry, and a learning outcome is an understanding of \nthe chemical reactions necessary for the extraction of iron \nfrom iron ore, the game should take place at the molecular \nlevel. It is not appropriate to create a game where people \ncan throw random chemicals into a furnace, then observe \nthe outcomes and answer a multiple choice questionnaire. \nABA programmes, like games, break complex tasks into \nsimpler component tasks and ensure that learners can \nperform those simpler tasks before requiring performance \nof the complex skill.  So, the designer must clearly define \nnot only the ultimate learning outcome of the programme, \nbut also the series of steps that learners must reach on their \nway to that goal. In this way, a hierarchy of learning \noutcomes is created, where knowledge of the simplest \nconcepts and processes are taught first, and knowledge and \nperformance are built methodically.  Once the player has \npassed a challenge and demonstrated a knowledge of a \nparticular concept, they are immediately presented with a \nmore complex challenge that builds upon that newly \nacquired information.   \nMeasuring Behaviour \nMeasurement refers to the process of assigning numerical \nvalues to observed behaviour. Above, we mentioned the \n \nFigure 1. Diagram of the processes involved in an ongoing ABA programme. \n \n importance of ensuring that the skill that is the focus of the \nprogramme is exactly the same as the skill being measured. \nThis is particularly important when designing educational \ncomputer games, as it will allow us to automate the process \nof evaluation and feedback.   \nWe must also consider the units we are measuring. In \ntraditional educational settings it is normal to report the \nnumber of tasks that have been performed correctly and the \nnumber that have been performed incorrectly.  ABA \nprogrammes focus heavily not only on accuracy, but on \ntemporal aspects of performance. So, tasks are typically \ncarried out within time constraints.  Behaviour analysts \nhave found that measures which include temporal \ncomponents are a more accurate method for judging how \ncomfortable, or fluent the learner is with the material than \nsimple measures of accuracy [13]. So, requiring accurate \nperformance within strict time constraints is a proven \nmethod for ensuring that learners are familiar with the \nmaterial, and also reflects a commonly used game \nmechanic. \nRECORDING AND ANALYSING BEHAVIOUR CHANGE \nRecording data \nClosely related to the process of measuring behaviour, is \nthat of recording those measurements in a way that is easy \nfor both the learner and instructor to understand. Behaviour \nanalysts record every single instance of every target \nbehaviour. For example, in a spelling exercise, the position \nof each letter in a word is checked and marked whether it is \ncorrect or not. These raw data points are then entered on \nline graphs, called celeration charts, which allow both the \nteacher and learner to view easily any changes in the \nlearners\u2019 performance of that behaviour. In a computer \ngame, these data points must be recorded in a way that is \neasy for the game application to read and analyse.  \nInterestingly, the delivery of ABA programmes via \ncomputer games allows for a great deal of innovation in \nterms of recording and presenting data in ways that are \nuseful for both educators and learners to understand. \nCeleration charts have been developed for their ease of use \nfor the instructor, but computers have a far greater capacity \nfor manipulating data. While it will still be essential to \nrecord every data point and present them in a meaningful \nway, just how that data is presented is open to the creativity \nof the game designer. For example, games typically track \nperformance through a representation of health, lives, level, \nand other such metrics. This ability to present data in an \nengaging manner may be one of the key ways that computer \ngames can actually improve upon existing ABA \nprogrammes. \nAnalysing behaviour change \nThe key metric used by behaviour analysts in monitoring \nthe success of learners is the change in their behaviour over \ntime. Essentially, once a learning outcome has been \ndefined, the behaviour analyst continually measures the \nlearner performing that behaviour and examines whether or \nnot the learner is approaching that outcome.   \nConsider the example of a coach who is teaching a player to \nimprove their ability to score 3-point shots in basketball. \nThe coach will allow the player to shoot freely, marking \ndown the number of baskets the player makes out of ten \nshots.  The coach then instructs the player in how to \nimprove their technique before watching them practice.  \nAgain, the coach observes and marks down on a chart how \nmany are scored. This continues, until the player reaches \ntheir target, with the coach intervening only occasionally.  \nAutomating the process of analysing behaviour change is \nsimple, once the preceding steps of defining, measuring and \nrecording behaviour have been carried out in a methodical \nfashion.  In computer games, it may not be always possible \nto take a true baseline \u2013 if the taking of baseline data does \nnot seem congruent to the game design, then performances \non early attempts can be compared with performance on \nlater attempts in order to evaluate whether change in \nbehaviour is happening. Computer games can do exactly \nthis type of analysis, without the need for complex machine \nlearning algorithms.  \nProviding corrective feedback \nPresenting feedback \nFeedback is presented to learners in most educational \nprogrammes in order to give them information regarding \nhow closely their current level of performance matches \ntheir goals. The intention is to guide the learner towards \nexcellent performance.   \nThe process whereby performance-related feedback alters \nthe behaviour of learners has been referred to, by \nbehavioural psychologists, as operant conditioning [53,54]. \nThrough investigations of operant conditioning, behavioural \npsychologists have demonstrated how feedback should be \npresented in order to maximize the attention and motivation \nof learners [10].\t\r \u00a0These findings are directly relevant to the \ndesign of educational games. A brief explanation of how \nthese concepts are currently used in games is presented \nbelow. \nPositive Reinforcement describes a situation where the \npresentation of a stimulus as a consequence of an instance \nof behaviour makes that behaviour more likely to occur in \nthat context in future. For example, gaining experience \npoints and gold pieces for killing a goblin may make \ngoblin-slaughter the more likely response to future goblin \nencounters. \nNegative Reinforcement describes a situation where the \nremoval or termination of an existing stimulus (or existing \naversive condition) as a consequence of an instance of \nbehaviour makes that behaviour more likely to occur in that \ncontext in future.  Negative reinforcement is manifest in \ngames where players are forced to re-start from the \nbeginning of a level or stage when they die - not wanting to \nwaste time replaying the easy parts of the same level over-\nand-over is a powerful motivator. \nPositive Punishment describes a situation where the \npresentation or addition of a stimulus as a consequence of \nan instance of behaviour makes that behaviour less likely to \noccur in that context in future.\t\r \u00a0 For example, in modern \nFirst-person Shooter Games, running aggressively into \nbattle with machine guns firing and little regard to tactics is \ntypically punished by the player\u2019s\u2019 rapid death. \nNegative Punishment describes a situation where the \nremoval or termination of a stimulus as a consequence of an \ninstance of behaviour makes that behaviour less likely to \noccur. For example, in role-playing games, upon the \nplayer\u2019s death they are deducted an amount of previously \ncollected experience points. \nTable 2. Explanation of how operant conditioning processes \nwork in computer games. \nBoth engaging games and successful ABA programmes use \nthese basic processes in combination in order to ensure that \nthe game is able to provide consistent, appropriate and \nspecific feedback to the player, and to guide them towards \nperforming at a high skill level. When you wish a player to \nlearn a particular skill or strategy while playing your game, \nit appears that adopting the following  approach is useful; a) \noffering a variety of rewards for correct performance, b) \noffering persistent negative consequences for poor \nperformance, which the player will work to avoid, and c) \ndirectly presenting negative consequences when the player \ndoes something that you do not want them to do.  \nEvaluating the effectiveness of feedback \nIn order to apply these techniques successfully, it is crucial \nto understand the difference between a \u2018reward\u2019 and a \nreinforcer.  A reward is any stimulus given to a player on \nthe assumption that it will increase the likelihood of the \nrewarded behaviour being repeated in future.  However, \nsimply providing game players with extra points, new \nitems, or access to new levels is of little value unless the \ngame actually checks to see whether the player has learned \nfrom the reward.  \nBehavioural psychologists continually test whether the \nrewards they offer produce changes in the target behaviour \n(i.e. learning). If the targeted behaviour does increase as a \nconsequence of the delivery of a reward stimulus, then the \ngame can classify that stimulus as a reinforcer, and use it \nlater when necessary [53]. So, a reward simply refers to \nanything presented as a consequence of desired \nperformance; a reinforcer is an example of one of those \nevents that has been demonstrated to work. The same \nprinciple applies to punishers. \nAs there are very few (if any) stimuli that function as a \nreinforcer or punisher for all people at all times, it is \nnecessary that the game should be able to evaluate the \nimpact of the different rewards that it offers in order to \nevaluate whether the rewards provided by the game are \nones that the player, as an individual, is personally \nmotivated to obtain. Indeed, there should be different types \nof rewards that players can work for at any time and the \ngame should include some simple way of evaluating which \nrewards are most reinforcing for each player.  \nFortunately, behavioural psychologists have developed \nuseful techniques for evaluating the relative reinforcing \nstrength of different rewards, and it appears that these \ntechniques may be ideal for use in computer games.  \nHerrnstein [26] found that when two or more behaviour \noptions are available, behaviour can be explained quite well \nvia a mathematical formula that he called the \u2018matching \nlaw.\u2019 Understanding the matching law can help games \ndesigners create uniquely adaptive and engaging games.  \nHerrnsteins algorithm allows us to monitor the relative \nattractiveness of each of the various reinforcers on offer \nwith a given game.  \nThrough continuously monitoring a players behaviour, a \ngame (educational or otherwise) can automatically calculate \nwhich rewards are eliciting the most work from that player \n(i.e., which are most reinforcing).  In an entertainment \ngame such as Fallout 3 [6], for example, through \nmonitoring player activity, the game could easily identify \nthat a given player has spent twice as much time or effort \ndoing missions for which they will receive rare items, as \nthose for which they receive \u2018karma\u2019 points.  Using the \nMatching Law to interpret this data, the game could deduce \nthat rare items are twice as reinforcing for that player as \nkarma points. Thus, using this simple strategy, it is possible \nfor games to dynamically evaluate the reinforcing strength \nof each of the available game rewards for each individual \nplayer player, and make adjustments to its own reward \nsystem in order to exploit this data. A similar process would \nbe very useful for maintaining the engagement of \neducational games players. \nScheduling rewards \nOf huge importance to educational game design is the \nquestion of how best to maintain the attention and \nmotivation of the learner. Behaviour analysts have found \nthat in order to maintain behaviour, we must carefully \nconsider not only what to use as a reward, but also how and \nwhen learners should gain access to those rewards.  It is not \nsufficient to offer a reward after every action that a user \ntakes. Rather, in order to sustain attention over a period of \ntime, it is necessary to manipulate either the number of \nresponses required, or the time elapsed before \nreinforcement is delivered for a particular behaviour [18].\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\nDifferent schedules are appropriate in different contexts, \ndepending on the type of behaviour you wish to engender in \nthe user.  This process has been examined extensively in the \nbehaviour analysis literature under the term \u2018schedules of \nreinforcement\u2019 [10,18]. Below are four schedules \n commonly used in both education settings and computer \ngames. \nFixed Ratio schedules deliver reinforcement after every nth \nresponse.  For example, FR5 schedules provide \nreinforcement consistently after every fifth response. This \nschedule produces a high, steady rate of responding with a \nbrief pause after the delivery of the reinforcer. \nVariable Ratio schedules are similar to FR schedules, with \nthe exception that, rather than being predictable, the number \nof responses required for reinforcement oscillates around a \nmean.  This type of schedule creates a high and steady rate \nof responding and is typically the most economical; a lot of \nwork can be generated by few instances of reinforcement.  \nA Fixed interval is a schedule where only the first response \nafter a specified amount of time has elapsed is rewarded, \nwhile premature responses are not reinforced. \nVariable Interval schedules are similar to FI schedules, \nwith the exception that the time for which reinforcement is \nunavailable oscillates around a mean, rather than being \npredictable.  \nTable 3. Explanation of four different schedules of \nreinforcement. \nBehaviour analysts use combinations of these schedules in \norder to motivate learners.  Indeed, the literature [10,13,18] \nsuggests that if people have a consistent history of being \nreinforced for their efforts, the workload required to reach \nthose same rewards can be increased gradually over time \nwithout losing the motivational effects of those rewards. It \nis not necessary, or even good practice, to keep rewarding \nevery action.  Behavioural Psychologists refer to this \ntechnique as \u2018schedule leaning.\u2019 Indeed, the technique is \nalso observed in computer games, where the first few tasks \nthat a player completes are reinforced through new items, \nnew skills and leveling-up.  However, as the player \nprogresses and spends more time playing the game, the \nnumber of actions needed to produce a reinforcer are \nincreased.  \nAdapting to student performance \nBoth games and ABA programmes are built on the \nassumption that the challenges presented should be \nappropriate to the users\u2019 skill level. There should always be \nthe opportunity for reinforcement, regardless of the level of \nability that a learner initially demonstrates.  In order to \nensure that this is the case within an ABA-based \neducational game, that game must be able to analyse the \nplayers performance and adapt in order to consistently \npresent appropriate challenges. This appears to be quite a \nchallenge, but can be done quite effectively if the previous \nsteps have been taken carefully.   \nFirstly, clearly defined goals, each representing components \nof the ultimate target behaviours, mean that present \nbehaviour can always be compared to a relevant goal. If \ngoals are met quickly, the player should advance at a fast \npace. If goals are not met after repeated attempts, the player \nshould be required to repeat the simpler component tasks. \nIn this way, the player will always be striving towards \nachievable goals and the game will not present any \nchallenge without providing the player with the skills \nrequired to pass it. \nSecondly, as the player advances through the game at a \nquick pace, the game can recognize this and begin \npresenting rewards on a leaner schedule. The increased \nscarcity of rewards as the game progresses functions to \nsustain behaviour. \nThirdly, using the matching law, the game can evaluate the \nrelative reinforcing strength of the various rewards on offer \nin the game. This information can be used in a variety of \ndifferent ways, depending on what effect on player \nbehaviour is necessary.  For example, they can offer \nproportionally more of the more attractive rewards \n(adapting to individual differences), reduce the frequency of \nthose rewards over time (leaning the schedule), or adjust the \namount of work required to achieve each of the available  \nawards, in order to ensure that players are motivated to \nexperience each element of the game. \nCONCLUSION \nIn this paper we have identified that while computer games \nappear to represent an exciting new paradigm in education, \nthere is a lack of empirical evidence for their effectiveness. \nWe suggest that the current lack of success of these tools is \ndue to a lack of theoretical and methodological rigor in the \ndesign of educational games. There is a misunderstanding \nof the game features that must be included in educational \ngames and the teaching methodologies that are compatible \nwith gameplay.   \nWe propose that Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA), a \npersonalised method of teaching that has been demonstrated \nas highly successful wherever implemented, appears \nuniquely positioned to take advantage of the benefits that \nthe medium of computer games offer; their ability to teach \nin a one-to-one manner, to adapt to the performance of each \nindividual player, to deliver timely and specific feedback to \nplayers in a controlled manner, and to motivate players of a \nwide range of knowledge or skill levels.   \nFinally, we have laid out some steps that are central to the \ndesign of any ABA programme. Including these steps in the \ndesign of any educational game will ensure that the game \nteaches in a way that has both been demonstrated as \neffective and is also appropriate to the medium of computer \ngames.  \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThis work was carried out as part of the \"Leonardo\" project \n\"Learn to Lead\u201d funded by the EU Lifelong Learning \nProgram (http:\/\/www.learn2lead.unina.it). \nThe authors also wish to acknowledge informal discussions \nheld with Bryan Roche at the National University of \nIreland, Maynooth, and with Denis O\u2019Hora and Ian Stewart \nat the National University of Ireland, Galway, which have \nbeen useful in formulating the ideas presented in this paper. \nREFERENCES \n1.
