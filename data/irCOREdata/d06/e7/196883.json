Ramm and A. Rona J. Math. Phys. 52, 000000 (2011)\nHere, u0 is the solution to problem (4) and (5) in the absence of the embedded particles, i.e., the28\nsolution for the problem with M = 0,29\n[\u22072 + k2n20(x)]u0 = 0 in R3, (6)\nwhere n20(x) is the refraction coefficient in the absence of embedded particles, n20(x) = 1 in the30\nregion D\u2032 := R3 \\ D, and31\nu0 = eik\u03b1\u00b7x + v0, \u2202v0\n\u2202r\n\u2212 ikv0 = o\n(\n1\nr\n)\n, r \u2192 \u221e, (7)\nwhere \u03b1 \u2208 S2 is the direction of propagation of the incident plane wave, and S2 is the unit sphere32\nin R3.33\nWe are interested in the behavior of the scattering solution as a \u2192 0 and the wavenumber k > 034\nis arbitrary fixed. In other words, the physical assumption that the dimensionless parameter ka is35\nvery small, ka << 1, corresponds in our work to a study of the mathematical limiting procedure36\na \u2192 0.37\nIt was proved in Refs. 3 and 4, that, as a \u2192 0, the limiting field u does exist and solves the38\nequation,39\n[\u22072 + k2n2(x)]u = 0 in R3, (8)\nwhere40\nn2(x) \u2261 n20(x) \u2212 4\u03c0k\u22122h(x)N (x). (9)\nTherefore, in the limit a \u2192 0, under the constraints (1)\u2013(3), the limiting medium, obtained by41\nthe embedding of many small particles, has the refraction coefficient n2(x), given by (9). Since the42\nfunctions h(x) and N (x) are at our disposal, subject to the restrictions N (x) \u2265 0, \u0006h(x) \u2264 0, it is43\npossible to create any desired refraction coefficient n2(x), \u0006n2(x) \u2265 0, by choosing h(x) and N (x)44\nsuitably.45\nIt is assumed that the term \u201cpiecewise-continuous\u201d function f in this paper means that the set46\nM of discontinuities of f is of Lebesgue\u2019s measure zero and, if S is a subset of this set such that f47\nis unbounded on S, f |S = \u221e, then f grows not too fast as x tends to S48\n| f (x)| \u2264 c[dist(x,S)]\u03bd , 0 \u2264 \u03bd < 3, c = const \u2265 0, (10)\nso that the integral\n\u222b\nD f (x)dx exists as an improper integral.49\nThis paper is related to:3 its goal is to develop a theory, similar to the one in Ref. 3, for a different50\ngoverning equation51\nL0u0 := \u2207 \u00b7 (c2(x)\u2207u0) + \u03c92u0 = 0 in R3, (11)\nwhere the wave speed c(x) = c0 = const in D\u2032 := R3\\D, the complement of D in R3, and c(x) is52\na smooth and strictly positive function in D. The speed c(x), in general, has S as its discontinuity53\nsurface. In this case, Eq. (11) is understood in the distributional sense as an integral identity,54 \u222b\nR3\n(\u2212c2(x)\u2207\u03c6\u2207u0 + \u03c92\u03c6u0)dx = 0 \u2200\u03c6 \u2208 C\u221e0 (R3). (12)\nAlternatively, one may understand Eq. (11) as the following transmission problem:55\nL0u+0 = 0 in D, u+0 = u0 in D, (13)\n56\nL0u\u22120 = 0 in D\u2032, u\u22120 = u0 in D\u2032, (14)\n57\nu+0 = u\u22120 , c2+(x)\n\u2202u0\n\u2202N+\n= c2\u2212(x)\n\u2202u0\n\u2202N\u2212\non S. (15)\nThe transmission conditions (15) together with Eqs. (13) and (14) are equivalent to problem58\n(12). Existence and uniqueness of the solution to (13)\u2013(15) was proved in Ref. 6.59\n000000-3 Wave scattering by small bodies J. Math. Phys. 52, 000000 (2011)\nThe scattering problem, we are interested in, can be stated as follows: 60\nL0u = 0 in R3\\\nM\u22c3\nm=1\nDm ; u = uM , (16)\n61\u2202u\n\u2202N\n= \u03b6mu on Sm, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 M, (17)\n62\nu = u0 + v, vr \u2212 ikv = o(1\nr\n), r \u2192 \u221e. (18)\nIn Sec. II problem (16)\u2013(18) is investigated and the limiting behavior of u as a \u2192 0 is found. 63\nWe conclude this Introduction by a brief derivation of the governing Eq. (11). 64\nThe starting point is the Euler equation, 65\nv\u02d9 + (v,\u2207)v = \u2212\u2207 p\n\u03c1\n, (19)\nwhere v is the velocity vector of the sound wave, p = p(\u03c1) is the static pressure, \u03c1 is the density, 66\nand 67\n\u2207 p = c2(x)\u2207\u03c1, (20)\nwhere c(x) is the sound speed. 68\nLet the material in D be initially at rest, v = v(x, t) be a small perturbation of the equilibrium 69\nzero velocity, the density be of the form \u03c1 = \u03c10 + \u03c8(x, t), where \u03c10 is the equilibrium density of 70\nthe material, which is assumed to be constant, and \u03c8 and v are small quantities of the same order of 71\nsmallness. 72\nThe continuity equation is 73\n\u02d9\u03c8 = \u2212\u2207 \u00b7 (\u03c10v), (21)\nwhere the term \u2207 \u00b7 (\u03c8v) of the higher order of smallness is neglected. Differentiating (21) with 74\nrespect to time yields 75\n\u00a8\u03c8 = \u2212\u2207 \u00b7 (\u03c10v\u02d9). (22)\nUnder the same assumptions about \u03c1 = \u03c10 + \u03c8(x, t) and v, the term (v,\u2207)v in (19) is of the 76\nhigher order of smallness and is, therefore, neglected. Multiplying (19) by \u03c1 and neglecting the term 77\n\u03c8 v\u02d9 of higher order of smallness yields the acoustic momentum equation, 78\n\u03c10v\u02d9 = \u2212\u2207 p. (23)\nSubstituting (20) in (23) gives 79\n\u03c10v\u02d9 = \u2212c2(x)\u2207\u03c8, (24)\nwhere the relation \u2207\u03c1 = \u2207\u03c8 was used. This relation is exact for a constant \u03c10. 80\nSubstituting (24) in (22) yields 81\n\u00a8\u03c8 \u2212 \u2207 \u00b7 (c2(x)\u2207\u03c8) = 0. (25)\nIf \u03c8 = e\u2212i\u03c9t u, then (25) reduces to Eq. (11). 82\nII. THE SCATTERING PROBLEM 83\nIn this section, problem (16)\u2013(18) is studied. Assumptions (1) and (3) are still valid. 84\nLet G be the Green\u2019s function for the operator L0, 85\nL0G(x, y) = \u2212\u03b4(x \u2212 y) in R3. (26)\nG satisfies the radiation condition 86\n\u2202G\n\u2202|x| \u2212 ikG = o(\n1\n|x| ) as |x| \u2192 \u221e. (27)\n000000-4 A. G. Ramm and A. Rona J. Math. Phys. 52, 000000 (2011)\nThe following result from Ref. 5 will be used.87\nTheorem 1: In a neighborhood of a point of smoothness of c(x), one has88\nG(x, y) = 1\n4\u03c0 |x \u2212 y|c(x) (1 + o(1)), |x \u2212 y| \u2192 0. (28)\nIn a neighborhood of the point x \u2208 S, where S is a smooth discontinuity surface of c(x), one89\nhas90\nG(x, y) =\n{ 1\n4\u03c0c+(x) [r\n\u22121\nxy + bR\u22121 + o(1)], y \u2208 D,\n1\n4\u03c0c\u2212(x) [r\n\u22121\nxy \u2212 bR\u22121 + o(1)], y \u2208 D\u2032.\n(29)\nwhere91\nb :=c+(x) \u2212 c\u2212(x)\nc+(x) + c\u2212(x) , rxy := |x \u2212 y|, R =\n\u221a\n\u03c12 + (|x3| + |y3|)2, (30)\n92\n\u03c1 =\n\u221a\n(x1 \u2212 y1)2 + (x2 \u2212 y2)2. (31)\nThe origin of the local coordinate system lies on S, the plane x3 = 0 is tangent to S, c+(x) and93\nc\u2212(x) are the limiting values of c(x) when x \u2192 S from inside (and outside) of D.94\nIn Ref. 5, the operator L0 corresponds to the case \u03c9 = 0. However, in Ref. 3 it is proved that95\nadding to L0 a term q(x)G(x, y) with a bounded function q does not change the main term of the96\nasymptotic of G as x \u2192 y.97\nThe solution to problem (16)\u2013(15) is sought in the form98\nu = u0 +\nM\u2211\nm=1\n\u222b\nSm\nG(x, t)\u03c3m(t)dt. (32)\nFor any \u03c3m \u2208 L2(Sm), the function u, defined in (32), solves Eq. (16) and satisfies the radiation99\ncondition (15), since G does. Therefore, (32) will be the solution to problem (16)\u2013(15) if \u03c3m are100\nsuch that the boundary conditions (17) are satisfied. Uniqueness of the solution to problem (16)\u2013(15)101\nfollows from essentially the same arguments as in Ref. 3, see the proof of Theorem 1 in Ref. 3.102\nThe boundary conditions (15) imply103\nueN + Am\u03c3m \u2212 \u03c3mc\n\u22121\nm\n2\n= \u03b6mue + \u03b6m\n\u222b\nSm\nG(s, t)\u03c3m(t)dt, (33)\nwhere104\ncm := c(xm), \u03b6m = h(xm)\/a\u03ba ,\nand105\nue(x) := u(m)e := u0(x) +\n\u2211\nm \u2032 \u000e=m\n\u222b\nSm\u2032\nG(x, t)\u03c3m \u2032 (t)dt.

(35), \u2202T\u03c3m\n\u2202N\u2212 is the limiting value of the normal derivative on Sm from outside of Dm . 110\nEquation (35) is well known from the potential theory in the case c(x) = 1 and G(x, y) = ei\u03c9rxy4\u03c0rxy , 111\nrxy := |x \u2212 y|. 112\nIf c(x) \u000e= 1, then by Theorem 1, one may consider T and A as the operators, corresponding to 113\nc(x) = 1, divided by c(xm), because c(s) is assumed smooth in D, and, therefore, it varies negligibly 114\non the small distances of the order a. 115\nThe basic idea of solving the scattering problem (16)\u2013(18) is to use a representation of the 116\nscattered field as a sum of single layer potentials and transform this representation to a sum of two 117\nterms of which one is much larger than the other asymptotically, as a \u2192 0, (cf. Ref. 3). 118\nThe approach is to reduce the solution of the many-body scattering problem by small bodies 119\nto finding some numbers rather than the unknown functions \u03c3m , 1 \u2264 m \u2264 M . If M is very large, 120\nit is practically impossible to use the usual system of boundary integral equations for finding the 121\nunknown \u03c3m . 122\nLet us rewrite Eq. (32) as follows: 123\nu = u0(x) +\nM\u2211\nm=1\nG(x, xm)Qm +\nM\u2211\nm=1\n\u222b\nSm\n[G(x, t) \u2212 G(x, xm)]\u03c3m(t)dt, (36)\nwhere 124\nQm :=\n\u222b\nSm\n\u03c3m(t)dt, (37)\nand prove that 125\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223G(x, xm)Qm\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u000f\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u222b\nSm\n[G(x, t) \u2212 G(x, xm)]\u03c3m(t)dt\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223, a \u2192 0; d1 < |x \u2212 xm |, (38)\nwhere a \u0002 d1 \u0002 d. 126\nThe region d1 < |x \u2212 xm | clearly tends to D as a \u2192 0. The main term of the asymptotics of the 127\nfunction \u03c3m(t), as a \u2192 0, does not depend on t \u2208 Sm , it is a constant with respect to t depending on 128\na, equal to Qm4\u03c0a2 . (see Ref. 3). 129\nLet us explain why the above inequality (38) holds. Its left-hand side is O(|Qm |\/|x \u2212 xm |), 130\nwhile its right-hand side does not exceed maxz\u2208B(xm ,a) |\u2207zG(x, z)|a|Qm |. 131\nOne has 132\nmax\nz\u2208B(xm ,a)\n|\u2207zG(x, z)| = O(max{ 1|x \u2212 xm |2 ,\nk\n|x \u2212 xm | }).\nIf |x \u2212 xm | \u000f a and ka \u0002 1, then 1|x\u2212xm | \u000f a max{ 1|x\u2212xm |2 , k|x\u2212xm | }. Therefore, inequality (38) is 133\nvalid. 134\nLet us choose the region |x \u2212 xm | \u000f a to be |x \u2212 xm | \u2265 d1, where d1 = O\n(\na\n2\u22120.5\u03ba\n3\n)\n, so one has 135\na \u0002 d1 \u0002 d as a \u2192 0. We now want to prove that the input into the scattering solution u of the 136\nterms in the second sum in Eq. (36), which lie in the region |x \u2212 xm | \u2264 d1 is negligible as a \u2192 0. 137\nSince the distance between neighboring particles is O(d), one concludes that there is one particle 138\nof radius a, centered at xm , and there are no other particles in the region a < |x \u2212 xm | \u2264 d1 because 139\nthe distance between small particles is O(d) \u000f d1. The input of one particle to the second sum in 140\n(36) is the quantity of the order O(aa\u22122a2\u2212\u03ba ) as a \u2192 0, i.e., O(a1\u2212\u03ba ). This quantity tends to zero 141\nas a \u2192 0. Here the term O(a\u22122) is the order of |\u2207zG(x, z)| when |z \u2212 xm | = O(a), and the term 142\nO(a2\u2212\u03ba ) is the order of |Qm | [see (46) below]. This explains the order of the magnitude O(a1\u2212\u03ba ) of 143\nthe input of the particles which lie in the region a < |x \u2212 xm | \u2264 d1 to the second sum in (36). Since 144\nO(a1\u2212\u03ba ) is negligible as a \u2192 0, one can neglect the second sum in (36) as a \u2192 0. 145\nThus, the solution u of the many-body scattering problem can be written as 146\nu = u0(x) +\nM\u2211\nm=1\nG(x, xm)Qm, |x \u2212 xm | \u000f a, (39)\nwith the error that tends to zero as a \u2192 0. 147\n000000-6 A. G. Ramm and A. Rona J. Math. Phys. 52, 000000 (2011)\nConsequently, the scattering problem is solved if the numbers Qm , 1 \u2264 m \u2264 M , are found. This148\nsimplifies the solution of the many-body scattering problem drastically because Eq. (32) requires149\nthe knowledge of the functions \u03c3m(t), 1 \u2264 m \u2264 M , rather than the numbers Qm , in order to find the150\nsolution u of the scattering problem.151\nThe next step is to derive the main term of the asymptotics of Qm as a \u2192 0.152\nTo do this, we integrate (33) over Sm and neglect the terms of the higher order of smallness as153\na \u2192 0.154\nOne has155 \u222b\nSm\nueN ds =\n\u222b\nDm\n\u22072uedx = (\u22072ue)(xm)|Dm |, |Dm | = 4\u03c0a\n3\n3\n, (40)\nwhere the Gauss divergence theorem was applied and a mean value formula for the integral over Dm156\nwas used.157\nFurthermore,158 \u222b\nSm\nA\u03c3mds = \u2212 1\ncm\n\u222b\nSm\n\u03c3mds = \u2212 Qm\ncm\n, (41)\nwhere (cf. Ref. 3)159 \u222b\nSm\nA\u03c3ds := 1\ncm\n\u222b\nSm\nds\n\u222b\nSm\n\u2202\n\u2202Ns\n1\n4\u03c0rst\n\u03c3 (t)dt = \u2212 1\ncm\n\u222b\nSm\n\u03c3 (t)dt. (42)\nThus, integrating (33) over Sm yields160\n\u22072ue(xm)|Dm | \u2212 c\u22121m Qm = \u03b6mue(xm)|Sm | +\n\u03b6m\ncm\n\u222b\nSm\ndt\u03c3m(t)\n\u222b\nSm\nds\n1\n4\u03c0rst\n, (43)\nwhere |Sm | = 4\u03c0a2 is the surface area of the sphere Sm and formula (28) was used, namely, we have161\nreplaced G(s, t) by 14\u03c0rst\n1\nc(s) using the smallness of Dm , and we have replaced c(s) by c(xm) = cm162\nbecause |xm \u2212 s| \u2264 a and a is small.163\nUsing the identity164 \u222b\nSm\nds\n4\u03c0rst\n= a if |s \u2212 xm | = a and |t \u2212 xm | = a, (44)\none gets from (43) the following relation:165\nQm(c\u22121m + c\u22121m \u03b6ma) = \u22124\u03c0\u03b6mue(xm)a2 + O(a3). (45)\nIf a \u2192 0 and \u03ba \u2208 (0, 1), then166\n\u03b6ma = h(xm)a1\u2212\u03ba = o(1), a \u2192 0,\nthe term O(a3) in (45) can be neglected, and one gets the main term of the asymptotics of Qm as167\na \u2192 0, namely,168\nQm = \u22124\u03c0h(xm)ue(xm)c(xm)a2\u2212\u03ba [1 + o(1)], a \u2192 0. (46)\nTherefore, (34), (39), and (46) yield169\nue(x) = u0(x) \u2212 4\u03c0\n\u2211\nm \u2032 \u000e=m\nG(x, xm \u2032 )h(xm \u2032)ue(xm \u2032 )c(xm \u2032 )a2\u2212\u03ba [1 + o(1)]. (47)\nTaking x = xm and neglecting o(1) term in (47), one gets a linear algebraic system for the170\nunknown quantities um := ue(xm), 1 \u2264 m \u2264 M ,171\num = u0m \u2212 4\u03c0\n\u2211\nm \u2032 \u000e=m\nG(xm, xm \u2032 )h(xm \u2032)c(xm \u2032 )um \u2032a2\u2212\u03ba . (48)\nLet us now derive and use a generalization of the result proved originally in Ref. 3. This172\ngeneralization is formulated as Theorem 2 below.173\n000000-7 Wave scattering by small bodies J. Math. Phys. 52, 000000 (2011)\nConsider the sum 174\nI = lim\na\u21920\na2\u2212\u03ba\nM\u2211\nm=1\nf (xm), (49)\nwhere the points xm are distributed in D according to (3). 175\nAssume that f (x) is piecewise-continuous and (10) holds. If f is unbounded, that is, the set S 176\nis not empty, then the sum (49) is understood as follows: 177\nI := lim\n\u03b4\u21920\nlim\na\u21920\na2\u2212\u03ba\nM\u2211\nm=1,dist(xm ,S)\u2265\u03b4\nf (xm). (50)\nTheorem 2: Under the above assumptions, there exists the limit (49) and 178\nlim\na\u21920\na2\u2212\u03ba\nM\u2211\nm=1\nf (xm) =\n\u222b\nD\nf (x)N (x)dx. (51)\nProof of Theorem 2 is given at the end of this paper. 179\nApplying Theorem 2 to the sum (47), one obtains the following result: 180\nTheorem 3: There exists the limit, 181\nlim\na\u21920\nue(x) := u(x),\nand the limiting function solves the equation, 182\nu(x) = u0(x) \u2212 4\u03c0\n\u222b\nD\nG(x, y)h(y)c(y)N (y)u(y)dy. (52)\nApplying operator L0, defined in (11), to (52) and using the relations 183\nL0G = \u2212\u03b4(x \u2212 y), L0u0 = 0, (53)\none obtains the following new equation for the limiting effective field u: 184\nL0u = 4\u03c0h(x)c(x)N (x)u. (54)\nThis equation can be written as 185\nLu := \u2207 \u00b7 (c2(x)\u2207u) + \u03c92u \u2212 4\u03c0h(x)c(x)N (x)u = 0. (55)\nTherefore, embedding many small particles into D and assuming (1)\u2013(3) , one obtains in the 186\nlimit a \u2192 0 a medium with essentially different properties described by the new equation (55). 187\nLet us now prove Theorem 2. 188\nProof of Theorem 2: 189\nLet S be the subset of the set of discontinuities of f on which f is unbounded, let the assumption 190\n(10) hold, and let 191\nD\u03b4 := {x : x \u2208 D, dist(x,S) \u2265 \u03b4}. (56)\nConsider a partition of D\u03b4 into a union of small cubes \bp, centered at the points yp, with the 192\nside b = a1\/3. One has 193\na2\u2212\u03ba\nM\u2211\nm=1,dist(xm ,M)\u2265\u03b4\nf (xm) =\n\u2211\np\nf (yp)[1 + o(1)]a2\u2212\u03ba\n\u2211\nxm\u2208\bp\n1\n=\n\u2211\np\nf (yp)N (yp)|\bp|[1 + o(1)]\n\u2192\n\u222b\nD\u03b4\nf (y)N (y)dy as a \u2192 0.\n(57)\n000000-8 A. G. Ramm and A. Rona J. Math. Phys. 52, 000000 (2011)\nHere in the second sum we replaced f (xm) by f (yp) for all points xm \u2208 \bp. This is done with194\nthe error o(1) as a \u2192 0 because f is continuous in D\u03b4 . In the third sum, we have used formula (3) for195\n\b = \bp. The last conclusion, namely, the existence of the limit as a \u2192 0, follows from the known196\nresult: the Riemannian sum of a piecewise-continuous bounded in D\u03b4 function f (x)N (x) converges197\nto the integral\n\u222b\nD\u03b4 f (x)N (x)dx if maxp diam\bp \u2192 0. In our case,198\ndiam\bp =\n\u221a\n3a1\/3 \u2192 0 as a \u2192 0, (58)\nso formula (57) follows.199\nFrom the assumption (10) with \u03bd < 3, one concludes that200\nlim\n\u03b4\u21920\n\u222b\nD\u03b4\nf (x)N (x)dx =\n\u222b\nD\nf (x)N (x)dx. (59)\nThe integral on the right in (59) exists as an improper integral if \u03bd is less than the dimension of201\nthe space, i.e., \u03bd < 3. Therefore, formula (51) is established.202\nTheorem 2 is proved. \u0002203\nWhile this paper has been under consideration (from October 2009), some related papers have204\nbeen published, see Refs. 1, 2, 7 and 8.205\n1 Andriychuk, M. and Ramm, A.
