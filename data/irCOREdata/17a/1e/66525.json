Here we present analysis of three transient atoll sources showing\nthat there is an additional branch in the colour-colour diagram of atoll sources which\nappears at very low luminosities. This new branch connects to the top of previously\nknown C-shaped (atoll) path, forming a horizontal track where the average source flux\ndecrease from right to left. This turns the C-shape into a Z. Thus both atolls and Z\nsources share the same topology on the colour-colour diagram, and evolve in similar\nway as a function of increasing averaged mass accretion rate. This strongly favours\nmodels in which the underlying geometry of these sources changes in similar ways. A\npossible scenario is one where the truncated disc approaches the neutron star when\nthe accretion rate increases, but that in the atolls the disc is truncated by evaporation\n(similarly to black holes) whereas in the Z sources it is truncated by the magnetic\nfield.\nKey words: accretion, accretion discs \u2013 X-rays: binaries\n1 INTRODUCTION\nLow mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) hosting a neutron star\ncan be observationally divided into two main categories,\ndubbed atolls and Z sources (Hasinger & van der Klis 1989).\nThis classification is based on changes in both spectral and\ntiming properties as the source varies. Z sources are named\nafter a Z-shaped track they produce on an X-ray colour-\ncolour diagram. Atolls can fall into one of the two spectral\nstates, a hard, low luminosity \u2018island\u2019 or a soft, high lumi-\nnosity \u2018banana\u2019. They trace a U-shaped or C-shaped track as\nthe source spectrum evolves between the island and the ba-\nnana (see e.g. fig. 1 in Me\u00b4ndez et al. 1999). These differences\nbetween the two LMXBs categories probably reflect differ-\nences in both mass accretion rate, M\u02d9 , and magnetic field, B,\nwith the Z sources having high luminosity (typically more\nthan 50 per cent of the Eddington limit) and magnetic field\n(B \u2265 109 G) while the atolls have lower luminosity (gener-\nally less than 10 per cent of Eddington) and low magnetic\nfield (B \u226a 109 G) (Hasinger & van der Klis 1989).\nBoth atolls and Z sources move along their tracks on the\ncolour-colour diagram and do not jump between the track\nbranches. Most of the X-ray spectral and timing properties,\ne.g. the kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) frequency\n(Me\u00b4ndez & van der Klis 1999), depend only on the position\nof a source in this diagram. This is usually parameterized\nby the curve length, S, along the track.\nThis strongly suggests that a single parameter deter-\nmines the overall properties of the source, generally believed\nto be the accretion rate, which increases with S from the hor-\nizontal (top) to the flaring (bottom) branch in the Z sources,\nand from the island to the banana in the atolls. The increas-\ning characteristic frequencies in the power spectra along the\ntrack are then generally explained by the inner disc radius\ndecreasing as a function of S (e.g. the review by van der Klis\n2000). However, the situation is more complex as S is not\nsimply related to the observed X-ray luminosity as would be\nexpected if it is determined by the mass accretion rate (e.g.\nvan der Klis 2000; 2001).\nIn this letter we present a compilation of RXTE data\nfrom three transient atoll sources. Their large amplitude of\nluminosity variation allows us to plot the full track in the\ncolour-colour diagram, which appears to form a shape of \u2018Z\u2019,\nsimilar to Z sources.\n2 THE DATA\nWe have analysed the RXTE observations of the three atoll\nLMXBs: Aql X-1 (Cui et al. 1998; Reig et al. 2000), 4U 1608\u2013\nc\u00a9 2001 RAS\n2 M. Gierlin\u00b4ski, C. Done\nFigure 1. Colour-colour diagrams of three atoll sources. The colours are defined as a ratios of the counts in 4\u20136.4 keV over 3\u20134 keV\nbands (soft) and 9.7\u201316 over 6.4\u20139.7 keV bands (hard). The upper panels show original background-subtracted diagrams with the bin\nsize of 128 s. The lower panels contain rebinned data and a size of each data point is proportional to the total count rate in detectors 0,\n2 and 3, in the 3\u201316 keV band.\n52 and 4U 1705\u201344 (Hasinger & van der Klis 1989). 4U 1608\u2013\n52 is a transient source and its most recent outburst in 1998\nwas observed by RXTE with a good coverage of both island\nand banana states. Aql X-1 is also a transient, showing out-\nbursts in a time-scale of months to years. 4U 1705\u201344 is a\nstrongly variable X-ray source, switching between the island\nand banana states on the time-scales of months.\nWe have used publicly available RXTE\/PCA data of\nthese three sources from PCA epochs 3 (between 1996 April\n15 and 1999 March 22) and 4 (between 1999 March 22 and\n2000 May 13). We selected data from detectors 0, 2 and 3,\nexcluding all type I bursts and observations with very poor\nstatistics. This gave 477 ks of data for Aql X-1, 219 ks for\n4U 1608\u201352 and 172 ks for 4U 1705\u201344. The PCA light-\ncurves for each energy channel were extracted in 128 s bins.\nThese were used to build a colour-colour diagram, defining\na soft colour as a ratio of 4\u20136.4 to 3\u20134 keV count rates, and\na hard colour as a 9.7\u201316 over 6.4\u20139.7 keV ratio.\nThe response of the PCA detectors is slowly varying as\na function of time. Additionally, the high-voltage settings\nof the instruments were altered between the PCA epochs\n3 and 4. Therefore, the energy boundaries of each energy\nchannel change in time, causing a shift in the colours. We\nhave approximately taken these changes into account by\nreading these boundaries from the response matrices cre-\nated for the beginning and end of each PCA epoch, and\nby linearly interpolating between them. When accumulating\ncounts in each of the four energy bands (used for comput-\ning the colours), we have interpolated the number of counts\nfor channels on the edges of these energy bands. We have\nchecked the correctness of this procedure using Crab data\nfrom various observations in both PCA epochs. We com-\nputed colours and noticed that the position of Crab on the\ndiagram still changes in time. This is due to the approxi-\nmate character of the colours we had calculated. Therefore,\nto account for this variation, we have calculated multiplica-\ntive factors for the colours from the Crab data and applied\nthem to our data (see e.g. Homan et al. 2001 for the simi-\nlar method). The final result is presented in Fig. 1 (upper\npanels).\nTo make these plots clearer and to enhance the evo-\nlutionary track on the diagram we have rebinned the data\nc\u00a9 2001 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20135\nColour-colour diagrams of LMXBs 3\nusing a nearest neighbour clustering technique. In each step\nof the iteration the two nearest bins (data points) on the\ncolour-colour diagram were found. The total numbers of\ncounts in both bins were added and a new count rate and\ncolours were calculated. Thus, the two bins were replaced by\none. The procedure was carried on until the assumed num-\nber of bins (between 8 and 10, as seen in the lower panels of\nFig. 1) was reached. This method gathers together the data\nwith similar spectral properties (colours) as opposed to in-\ncreasing the length of the time bin, which averages data in\ntime. The result is presented in Fig. 1 (lower panels). The\nsize of the symbol is proportional to the logarithm of the\ncount rate, so it gives an overview of the luminosity changes\nin the diagram.\n3 RESULTS\nAll three colour-colour diagrams in Fig. 1 show features\ncharacteristic of atoll sources that have been known for many\nyears (e.g. van der Klis 1995; Me\u00b4ndez 1999). There is a ba-\nnana in the lower part and several islands in the upper part\nof the diagram. The banana is significantly brighter than\nthe islands, and the X-ray flux increases along the banana\nbranch, from left to right.\nHowever, this large compilation of data shows other fea-\ntures which have not previously been seen from sparser data\nsets. There are three distinct branches in the colour-colour\ndiagram. The banana branch forms a lower horizontal track\nat hard colour of \u223c 0.4, while the island state begins along\nthe diagonal track which connects to the left-hand end of\nthe banana. But there is a part of the diagram not reported\nbefore: an upper horizontal branch, at hard colour of \u223c 0.7\u2013\n0.8, connected to the upper right end of the diagonal branch.\nIt is particularly pronounced in 4U 1705\u201344. This extends\nthe previously known C-shaped pattern into a Z. There were\nhints of this extension in previous observations of 4U 1705\u2013\n44 (Langmeier et al. 1989), but this is the first time that it\nis shown so noticeably.\nTo show this new branch more clearly we have created\na combined colour-colour diagram of all three sources. Since\nthese three atolls have similar spectral and timing proper-\nties, they probably have the same underlying accretion ge-\nometry and radiation mechanisms. Thus we might expect\ntheir spectral evolution, and hence the colour-colour dia-\ngrams to be the same, but despite similarities in shape, the\ncolour-colour diagrams of Fig. 1 are shifted with respect to\neach other. This is mainly caused by differences in absorp-\ntion, which strongly affects the soft colour, but there might\nalso be subtle shifts in hard colour from differences in spin\nfrequency (affecting disc-to-boundary layer luminosity ratio\nand hence the soft colour as well) and perhaps also the incli-\nnation angle. We have attempted to correct for these effects\nby simply shifting the diagrams in both colours. We have\nlinearly transformed each 128 s data point of each source\nin a way that the left-hand edge of the lower branch have\ntransformed colours of (1, 1) and the right-hand edge of the\nupper branch transforms to (2, 2). The resulting diagram\nof all three sources together is shown in Fig. 2. We can see\nthat the three diagrams coincide very well, and the three\nbranches forming a Z-shaped track are clearly visible.\nWe have analysed source movement along the Z-shaped\nFigure 2. The \u2018big picture\u2019 of the atoll sources: a combined\ncolour-colour diagram of Aql X-1, 4U 1608\u201352 and 4U 1705\u201344.\nThe colours of the three sources from Fig. 1 were linearly trans-\nformed so as to co-align all three systems at turns on the track.\nThe sources clearly define a Z-shaped track. The curve defines\nthe position along the track, S.\ntrack. For this, we have taken the original (i.e. not colour-\nbinned) colour-colour diagram of 4U 1705\u201344 and traced\nhow the position of the source (in 128 s data bins) moves\nwith time. We confirm that motion in the diagram, includ-\ning the upper branch, goes along the track and we do not\nnotice jumps between the branches (though jumps cannot\nbe completely excluded, since the data is rather sparse in\ntime). 4U 1705\u201344 can cross the full width of the upper\nbranch in about 10 days, while transition on the diagonal\ntakes about five days (a similar transition in 4U 1608\u201352\ntook about three days). The movement in the lower branch\nis much faster, with time-scales of hours.\nThe lower panels in Fig. 1 show that the average X-ray\nflux at a given point on the track increases from left to right\n(i.e. with increasing soft colour) both in the upper and lower\nbranches. To study the source flux along the track in details,\nfor each grouped point in Fig. 1 we have extracted a typical\nPCA spectrum from a single RXTE pointing (one to three\norbits, usually 3\u201310 ks of exposure) with the same colours\nand mean count rate. These spectra were fit with a model\nof a blackbody, Comptonized component and its reflection,\nwith absorption set at 0.5, 1.5 and 1.2\u00d71022 cm\u22122, for Aql\nX-1, 4U 1608\u201352 and 4U 1705\u201344 respectively (Church &\nBa lucin\u00b4ska-Church 2001; Penninx et al. 1989; Predehl &\nSchmitt 1995). These show that the spectra all along the\nupper horizontal branch are rather hard, similar to those\npreviously seen in the hardest island states. The bolometric\nflux was calculated by extrapolating the unabsorbed model\nspectrum, so it is somewhat model dependent but gives at\nleast a zeroth order correction. In Fig. 3 we plot this bolo-\nmetric flux in arbitrary units as a function of distance S\nalong the Z track. We have defined the right-hand edge of\nthe upper branch as S = 1, and the left-hand edge of the\nlower branch as S = 2 and linearly interpolated to get the\nS value of all the other data points (see Fig. 2). The bolo-\nmetric fluxes are scaled so that they are roughly equal at\nthe S = 1 point. It is clear that the shapes of these curves\nc\u00a9 2001 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20135\n4 M. Gierlin\u00b4ski, C. Done\nFigure 3. Bolometric luminosity (absorption corrected) as a\nfunction of S, i.e. distance along the Z track. The luminosities\nare linearly scaled so that they match at the S = 1 point. The\nevolution of luminosity as a function of S is remarkably similar\nfor all 3 sources.\nare very similar for all 3 sources, showing a steady rise in\nthe upper branch (S \u2264 1), and then a drop on the diagonal\nbranch, and then rising again along the lower branch.\nThis average bolometric flux most likely corresponds to\nthe average mass accretion rate. Then, extending a LMXB\nparadigm we suggest that the accretion rate increases along\nthe Z-shaped track in the colour-colour diagram. There is\nhowever a decrease of the flux on the diagonal branch. We\nspeculate that this might associated with jet formation. It\nis known that jets are associated with state transitions in\nboth neutron star and black hole transients (e.g. Fender &\nKuulkers 2001). Alternatively, the mass accretion rate onto\nthe central source (and hence the hard X-ray flux) could be\nreduced if much of the inflowing material was used to extend\nthe disc inwards.\nTo convert X-ray fluxes into true luminosity requires a\ndistance. For these three sources the best distance estimates\nare: 3.6 kpc for 4U 1608\u201352 from radius expansion of X-\nray bursts (Nakamura et al. 1989), 4\u20136.5 kpc for Aql X-1\nfrom optical spectroscopy of the companion star (Rutledge\net al. 2001) and 6.3\u20138.2 kpc for 4U 1705\u201352 from modelling\nof X-ray bursts (Haberl & Titarchuk 1994). This gives the\nS = 1 point at 5, 4\u201310 and 10\u201317 per cent of Eddington\nluminosity (LEdd = 1.76 \u00d7 10\n38 ergs s\u22121), for 4U 1608\u201352,\nAql X-1 and 4U 1705-44, respectively. Since luminosity esti-\nmates from X-ray bursts are approximate and might contain\nunknown systematic errors (see e.g. in \u2019t Zand et al. 2001),\nit is possible that the position in the colour-colour diagram\nof all these three atolls depend on the X-ray luminosity in\nthe same way, and that the S = 1 point corresponds to \u223c\n5\u201310 per cent of LEdd.\n4 DISCUSSION\nThe three atolls studied here are transient systems, where\nthe luminosity changes by a factor of >\u223c 100, unlike the ma-\njority of atolls which are not very variable. The transients go\ndown to very low luminosities where they show a new track\non the colour-colour diagram which extends the previously\nknown atoll (or C) shaped path into a Z. This new upper\nbranch is clearly distinguished from a simple extension of the\npreviously known C-shaped track. Below S = 1, the track\nturns so that the average source luminosity decreases from\nright to left on the colour-colour diagram. We propose that\nall atolls would show such a track if their mass accretion rate\ncould change by a large enough factor, but that their nor-\nmal, rather small range in variability limits their observed\ncolour-colour diagram to only a small section of the track.\nA good example of this is 4U 1728\u201334, regarded as an\narchetypal atoll tracing a C-shaped track in the diagram\n(Me\u00b4ndez & van der Klis 1999; Di Salvo et al. 2001). However,\nthe ratio of the highest to lowest count rate of this source is\nonly about 2.5 (Di Salvo et al. 2001). Therefore, we suggest\nthat the 4U 1728\u201334 data collected so far shows a colour-\ncolour diagram which is limited to the diagonal and lower\nbranches of a Z track. The source never goes to low enough\nluminosities to sample much of the upper branch.\nThus, we show that atolls share the same colour-colour\ntopology with the Z sources. With increasing accretion rate\nthey both trace out a similar Z-shaped pattern. Despite this\nsimilarity, these two LMXB categories are of course not the\nsame. They differ in the luminosity range required to cover\nthe whole Z track (Z sources are much less variable then the\nthree transient atolls presented here) and in the time taken\nto trace out the upper and diagonal branches (Z sources\nmove much faster). Another important difference is the lu-\nminosity at which the Z-shaped pattern arises. For the Z\nsources the transition from the upper (horizontal) branch to\nthe diagonal (normal) branch occurs at around 0.5\u20131 LEdd,\nwhile for the atolls this transition occurs at luminosities\nabout ten times less. There is also a significant difference\nin the spectral shape in the upper branch: spectra of the\natolls are much harder, similar to hard state of black hole\ncandidates.\nThe differences in luminosity and spectral shape can be\nreconciled in a model in which the fundamental difference\nbetween atolls and Z sources is magnetic field. Evolution\nalong the Z track is caused by the increasing mass accretion\nrate, M\u02d9 , decreasing the inner radius, Rin, of a truncated\ndisc. For the atolls the disc is probably truncated by evapo-\nration (e.g. Ro\u00b4z\u02d9an\u00b4ska & Czerny 2000), leading to an inner,\noptically thin, hot flow which gives the hard X-ray spectrum.\nHowever, the evaporation efficiency decreases as a function\nof increasing mass accretion rate, so this cannot truncate\nthe disc in the Z sources. Instead the truncation is likely to\nbe caused by stronger magnetic field, but here the increased\nmass accretion rate means that the inner flow is much more\noptically thick, and so cooler.\nWe note that after this paper was submitted to\nMNRAS, another group independently presented very\nsimilar results (Muno, Remillard & Chakrabarty, astro-\nph\/0111370).\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank Didier Barret for attracting our attention to the\n4U 1705\u201344 data.
