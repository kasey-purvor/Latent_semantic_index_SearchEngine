The unpredictable and highly\ncomplex stochastic behavior of such systems arises in part\nfrom the presence of limit sets of complex geometrical\nstructure, and in part from the fractality of the basin\nboundary [5,6]. For this reason, the central question \u2014\nwhether or not there exists a generic mechanism for\nfluctuational transitions across the FBB \u2014 has remained\nunanswered. It has been unclear (i) if boundary condi-\ntions can be found both on the CA and on the FBB, (ii) if\nthere exits a unique escape path from the CA to the FBB,\n(iii) whether this path can be determined using the\nHamiltonian theory of fluctuations, (iv) if there is any\ndeterministic structure involved in the transition, and\n(v) what influence is exerted by the noise intensity. If\ntransitions across FBBs are characterized by general\nfeatures, a knowledge of them could considerably sim-\nplify analyses of both stability and control for chaotic\ndynamical systems, which are problems of broad inter-\ndisciplinary interest [7,8].\nA promising approach to this problem is based on the\nanalysis of fluctuations in the limit of small noise inten-\nsity: the system fluctuates to remote states along most\nprobable deterministic paths [9\u201311] that correspond to\nrays in the WKB-like asymptotic solution of the Fokker-\nPlanck equation [12]. The approach has been extended to\nchaotic systems, both continuous and discrete [1\u20134], and\nit was shown [13] that the homoclinic tangencies respon-\nsible for fractalization of the basins cause a decrease of\nthe activation energy, i.e., of the minimum energy needed\nto escape from a basin.\nIn this Letter we demonstrate the existence of a mecha-\nnism of fluctuational transition between coexisting CAs\nseparated by an FBB. It is determined by the hierarchy of\noriginal saddles forming the homoclinic structure, and it\ninvolves a unique most probable escape path (MPEP)\nleaving the CA and approaching an accessible orbit on\nthe fractal boundary.0031-9007=03=91(17)=174104(4)$20.00 \uf6d9FBB to have been observed experimentally [14,16]. As we\nwill see, the mechanism of fluctuational transition across\nit is determined primarily by its deterministic structure,\nenabling us to argue that it is probably common to all\nsystems with FBBs of this kind. To demonstrate that such\na mechanism exists, we consider the two-dimensional\nmap with locally disconnected FBBs, introduced by\nHolmes [17],\nxn\u00011 \u0002 f1 \u0002 yn;\nyn\u00011 \u0002 f2 \u0001 \u0006n \u0002 \u0003b xn \u0001 d yn \u0003 y3n \u0001 \u0006n;\n(1)\nwhere \u0006n is zero mean, white, Gaussian noise of inten-\nsity D. In what follows we will adopt the notation xn \u0002\nfxn; yng, f \u0002 ff1; f2g, and \u0001n \u0002 f0; \u0006ng. Because of sym-\nmetry, the noise-free system (1) with b \u0002 0:2 and\n2:0 \u0006 d \u0006 2:745 has pairs of coexisting attractors, the\nbasins of which are separated by a boundary that may\nbe either smooth or fractal, depending on the choice of\nparameter values. Our chosen values b \u0002 0:2, d \u0002 2:7,\ncorrespond to two coexisting CAs separated by a locally\ndisconnected FBB (see Fig. 1). The fractal dimension of\nthe boundary is 1.844 72. The chaotic attractors in (1)\nappear as the result of a period-doubling cascade and,\nfor the parameters chosen, each consists of two discon-\nnected parts.\nWe have modeled (1) numerically, exciting it with weak\nnoise and collecting both the escape trajectories between\nthe CAs and also the corresponding noise realizations\nthat induced them. By ensemble averaging a few hundred\nsuch escape trajectories and noise realizations, we have\nobtained the optimal escape path and corresponding op-\ntimal force shown in Fig. 2. These results allow us to\ndetermine the boundary conditions near the CA and the\nFBB, and to demonstrate the uniqueness of the MPEP. In\nleaving the CA, the system falls into a small neighbor-\nhood of the saddle point of period 1 (S1) located between\nits two disconnected parts. Its stable manifolds separate\nthe parts of the CA, while the unstable ones belong to the\nCA.

Calculations show that, for the parameters\nchosen, S3 lies on the FBB and its stable manifold (solid\nblack line in Fig. 1) is dense in the FBB and detaches the\nopen neighborhood, including the attractor, from the\nFBB itself. This allows us to classify it as an accessible\nboundary point [18].\nAn analysis of the structure of escape paths inside the\nFBB has shown that the homoclinic saddle points play a\nkey role in its formation. In the system (1), we observe\nan infinite sequence of saddle-node bifurcations of pe-\nriod 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; . . . , at parameter values d3 < d4 < d5 <\nd6 < d7 . . . , caused by tangencies of the stable and un-\nstable manifolds of the saddle point O at the origin. The\nhomoclinic orbits appearing as a result of these bifurca-\ntions were classified earlier as original saddles, and it was\nalso shown that their stable and unstable manifolds cross\neach other in a hierarchical sequence [18]. It is this\ndeterministic structure of the manifolds of the original\nsaddles that determines the fluctuational escape mecha-\nnism across the FBB. Indeed, to escape from a CA, the\nsystem must first cross the stable manifold of the acces-\nsible orbit, and then the stable manifolds of the other\noriginal saddles in a predetermined hierarchical se-\nquence. Once the system crosses the stable manifold of a\nsaddle orbit it relaxes noise-free to the corresponding\norbit, which it then leaves orbit along its unstable mani-\nfold. Therefore the hierarchical interrelation between\noriginal saddles involved in the escape has to be closely\nlinked to eigenvalues of the Jacobian at these saddles,\ncharacterizing their local stability with respect to motion\non the manifolds. To quantify this interrelation we intro-\nduce a parameter \r \u0002 j\u000est\bxi\tj=\u000eun\bxi\t, where \u000est\bxi\t and\n\u000eun\bxi\t are the eigenvalues of the saddle point xi corre-174104-2sponding to the stable and unstable directions, respec-\ntively. This conclusion accords with the fact that the\nnatural measure \u0010 on a two-dimensional chaotic non-\nattracting set is concentrated along its unstable manifold\nand can be represented via unstable eigenvalues of un-\nstable orbits: \u0010\bC\t \u0002 P 1=\u000eun\bxi\t, where C is the region\nof phase space containing the chaotic saddle, \u000eun\bxi\t is\nthe eigenvalue corresponding to the unstable manifold,\nand the summation is over all the unstable orbits xi in C\n[19] (cf. [20]). Calculations have shown that, for the\noriginal saddles of period 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; . . . in (1), the\nfollowing hierarchical sequence of index\r values occurs:174104-2\nFIG. 3.

Moreover, the values of\r correspond-\ning to the other homoclinic saddle cycles are close to zero.\nCorrespondingly, the probability of finding the system in\ntheir neighborhood tends to zero.\nThese results allow us to infer the features of fluctua-\ntional transitions through a locally disconnected FBB:\n(i) it always occurs through a unique accessible boundary\npoint, and (ii) the original saddles forming the homo-\nclinic structure of the system play a key role in the\nformation of the paths inside the FBB, the difference in\ntheir local stability defining the hierarchical relationship\nbetween them. It seems therefore that, as in simpler\nsystems [9\u201312], fluctuation-driven escape across an\nFBB is in many respects deterministic in nature.\nOur arguments about the structure of the escape path\nfound in the numerical simulations are further supported\nby direct calculations of the MPEP using the Hamil-\ntonian theory of fluctuations [1\u20134]. In this theory the\nMPEP is the path which minimizes the energy S \u0002\n1\n2\nPN\nn\u00021 \u0006\n2\nn of the possible realizations of noise f\u0006ng induc-\ning a transition of the system (1) from the CA (with the\ninitial condition on S1) to the FBB (with the final con-\ndition on the accessible orbit S3).

[21]) in the form\nL \u0002\nXN\nn\u00021\n\u0003\n1\n2\n\u0001Tn\u0001n \u0001 \u0002Tn\u0001xn\u00011 \u0003 f\bxn\t \u0003 \u0001n\u0002\n\u0004\n;\nwhere xn\u00011, f\bxn\t, and \u0001n are the two-dimensional vec-\ntors defined in (1) and we introduce the two-dimensional\nvector \u0002n \u0002 f\u000exn; \u000eyng of Lagrange multipliers.

The MPEP\nis the minimum-energy heteroclinic trajectory connect-\ning S1 to S3 in the phase space of (2). The solution of this\nboundary-value problem involves parametrizing the\ncomplex structure of the multiple local energy minima\n(see, e.g., [22,23] for a discussion) requiring, in turn, a\nproper parametrization of the unstable manifold in the\nvicinity of the initial conditions [24]. The resultant MPEP\nis shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen that, between the vertical\ndotted lines in Fig. 2(a), the theoretical MPEP closely\ncoincides with the path obtained by statistical analysis of\nescape trajectories in the Monte Carlo simulations. Note\nthat no further action is required to bring the system to\nthe other attractor once it has reached the accessible orbit\nof the FBB, i.e., the points numbered 8 in Figs. 2(a) and174104-32(b); correspondingly, the optimal force measured in the\nnumerical simulations (inset) falls back to zero.\nTo demonstrate that the mechanism of transition across\nthe FBB is robust with respect to noise-induced pertur-\nbations and can indeed be characterized by the value of\nindex \r defined above, we have used randomly chosen\ninitial conditions in a very small neighborhood of the\naccessible point S3 through which escape occurs [see\nFig. 2(b)]. By definition, any arbitrarily small neighbor-\nhood of S3 lies within the FBB, and must contain points\nbelonging to the basins of both attractors. Therefore the\nsystem can cross the FBB starting from a very small\nneighborhood of S3, even in the absence of noise. By\ncollecting all such successful escape paths, we have cal-\nculated the probabilities for the system to pass via small\nneighborhoods of different original saddle cycles during\nits escape, both in the presence and absence of noise. The\ncorresponding probabilities, shown in Fig. 3, demonstrate\nthe same hierarchical interrelationship in both cases,\ndetermined by the value of index \r. This structure is\nevidently robust with respect to noise-induced perturba-\ntions. The addition of noise causes a slight broadening of\nthe distribution in Fig. 3 and a small increase in the\nprobability of escape via original saddles of larger period.\nIn conclusion, we have revealed the mechanism by\nwhich noise-induced escape occurs across a locally dis-\nconnected FBB. We have found the unique most probable\nescape path from the chaotic attractor to the fractal\nboundary, using both statistical analyses of fluctuational\ntrajectories and Hamiltonian fluctuation theory. We have\nshown that the original saddles forming the homoclinic\nstructure play a key role in effecting the transition across\nthe FBB itself. Their local stability defines the hier-\narchical relationship between the probabilities for the\nsystem to pass via small neighborhoods of different origi-\nnal saddle cycles during escape, both in the presence and\nabsence of noise. Our conjecture, that the mechanism is\ngeneric to the wide class of two-dimensional maps and\nflows [14,16,17] exhibiting the same type of FBB, has174104-3\nP H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending24 OCTOBER 2003VOLUME 91, NUMBER 17recently been confirmed for several systems of this kind\nincluding the Duffing oscillator, the He\u00b4non map, and\nGoodwin\u2019s economic model [25]. Possible applications\ninclude the development of new energy-optimal control\nschemes, e.g., for the CO2 laser, a discrete model which\nalso exhibits this type of FBB [26].\nWe thank Ulrike Feudel, Igor Khovanov, and Suso\nKraut for fruitful discussions.
