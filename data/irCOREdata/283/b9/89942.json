Against this \nconsensus, some men\u2019s groups have claimed that if women are \naccorded control over the decision to continue or to terminate a \npregnancy then it is unfair to hold genetic fathers financially liable for \nchild support. This paper assesses the merits of this claim from a \nfeminist perspective. Having considered a number of arguments, it \nsuggests that the currently accepted grounding of child support \nliability (in voluntary creation of need) provides little scope for  \nrefuting the men\u2019s groups\u2019 argument. The paper then moves on to \nargue that voluntary creation of need is, however, inadequate as a \nbasis for child support liability, and that the current analysis offers \ncompelling grounds for preferring a collective model of support \nobligations. \nKeywords:  fathers, abortion, child support \n \n \nTo saddle a man with at least eighteen years of expensive, exhausting child support liability \non the basis of a haphazard vicissitude of life seems to shock the conscience and be arbitrary, \ncapricious, and unreasonable, where childbirth results from the mother\u2019s free choice y a \nman no longer has any control over the course of a pregnancy he has biologically brought \nabout [and] it is unjust to impose responsibility where there is no ability to exercise control. \nAlthough the father played an initial physical role in the creation of the fetus, he no longer \nhas any control over the process which converts his biological act into personhood. The \nfather\u2019s participation in the procreative process begins and ends with the sexual act; from the \nmoment of conception on, all control and authority concerning the fate of the pregnancy \nrests with the mother. The father\u2019s role, in terms of decision making power, is reduced to \nimpotent bystander y As the authority to cause a birth has shifted exclusively to the \nwoman, so too should the responsibility flowing from the result of her unilateral exercise of \nthat authority shift to her solely, away from the helpless third-party father.1 \n \nIntroduction \n \nThere seems to be broad agreement in much of the western industrialised world \nthat men who father children out of marriage share an obligation to support them \nfinancially. As one leading American family lawyer puts it: \n \n1 M. B. Kapp, \u2018The Father\u2019s (Lack of ) Right and Responsibilities in the Abortion Decision: An \nExamination of the Legal-Ethical Implications\u2019 (1982) 9 Ohio NULR 370, 376\u2013377. \nKent Academic Repository \u2013 http:\/\/kar.kent.ac.uk  \nPublished version available in \u2018Modern Law Review 66 (2) pp175 \u2013 194\u2019 \n- 2 - \n \n \n \n [t]he duty that parents have to support their children rests, in our culture, on the widely \nshared belief in each person\u2019s responsibility for his voluntary actions and in deeply rooted \nnotions of what it means to be a parent. Conservatives feel additional anger when they, as \ntaxpayers, are required to pay for children born of nonmarital relationships that they \nconsider immoral. Liberals feel anger of another sort. They deplore the gendered nature of \nthe problem. They know that it is men who walk away from their children, and women left in \npoverty who bear the burden.\u20192 \n \nAgainst this consensus, some commentators (who, for the purpose of this article, I \nwill refer to as \u2018men\u2019s advocates\u2019) cry foul.3 They claim that if women have \ncomplete control over the decision to continue or to terminate a pregnancy then it \nis unfair to hold genetic fathers financially liable for child support.4 \nAs a feminist, I have long assumed that all genetic fathers should share in the \ncosts of raising a child for broadly the reasons which Chambers identifies above as \n\u2018liberal\u2019. Women are clearly disproportionately burdened (in both financial and \nother ways) by the care of children and this is a significant part of any convincing \nexplanation of the feminisation of poverty.5 This gross inequity would only be \nexacerbated by removing men\u2019s automatic liability for child support. Yet, on its \nown, I find this inadequate as a rebuttal of the claims of the men\u2019s advocates. \nConcerns about gender inequality alone cannot justify fixing financial duties \ntowards genetic children onto particular individuals, in this case their unwilling \ngenetic fathers.6 And the arguments which are typically made for fixing this \nobligation on these specific individuals are problematic to me precisely as a \n \n2 D. L. Chambers, \u2018Fathers, the Welfare System and the Virtues and Perils of Child-Support \nEnforcement\u2019 (1995) 81 Va L Rev2575, 2588. Gwendolyn Mink detects the same consensus \nbetween conservatives, moderates, and liberals and many middle-class feminists, noting that \n\u2018across thirty years of welfare reform, the only true faith has been in the child support obligation \nof the absent father\u2019, see G. Mink, Welfare\u2019s End (Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, \n1998) 78. \n3 The men\u2019s and fathers\u2019 rights movement is a disparate, complex and evolving body representing a \nvariety of (sometimes conflicting) interests, see: A. Gavanas, \u2018The Fatherhood Responsibility \nMovement: the Centrality of Marriage, Work and Male Sexuality in Reconstructions of \nMasculinity and Fatherhood\u2019, in B. Hobson (ed), Making Men into Fathers: Men, Masculinities \nand the Social Politics of Fathers (Cambridge University Press, 2002), and W. F. Horn, D. \nBlankenhorn and M. B. Pearlstein, The Fatherhood Movement: A Call to Action (Lanham and \nOxford: Lexington Books, 1999). I use \u2018men\u2019s advocates\u2019 as a convenient shorthand and do not \nmean to imply that all those who write on men\u2019s studies or masculinities, or even all of those \ninvolved in the men\u2019s and fathers\u2019 movement(s) would agree with the views advanced in this name. \n4 That putative fathers have no legal right to prevent their sexual partners from terminating \npregnancies has been established in the UK in the cases of Paton v BPAS [1979] QB 276, C v S \n[1988] QB 135, aff\u2019d CA, and Kelly v Kelly [1997] 2 FLR 828; in the European Court of Human \nRights (at least for early pregnancy) in Paton v UK (1980) 3 EHRR 408; in Canada in Murphy v \nDodd (11 July 1989), Toronto 1566\/89 (Ont S C) and Tremblay v Daigle [1989] S C R 530, 62 DLR \n(4th) 634; and the USA in Rothenberger v Doe (1977) 149 NJ Super 478; 374 A 2d 57; Coleman v \nColeman (1984) 57 Md. App 755; 471 A 2d 1115. The unconstitutionality of spousal consent, veto \nor consultation provisions has also been established in the USA in Planned Parenthood of Central \nMissouri v Danforth, S Ct 1976) 428 US 52, 96 S Ct 2831 and Planned Parenthood v Casey (SCt \n1992) 505 US 833, 112 S Ct 2791. \n5 62 per cent of lone parent families (the vast majority of which are headed by women) were \nofficially defined as living in poverty in 1998\/9, compared to only 24 per cent of two parent \nfamilies, see Department of Social Security Households Below Average Income: 1994\/95\u20131998\/9 \n(2000). By talking of \u2018burdens\u2019 here, I do not mean to suggest that raising children does not also \nbring benefits. Rather, following Martha Fineman, I am using \u2018burden\u2019 to signify \u2018that there are \ncosts associated with what women typically do as caretakers in society. These labors may provide \n\u2018\u2018joy,\u2019\u2019 but they are also burdensome and have material costs and consequences. Not to recognize \nthem as \u2018\u2018burdens\u2019\u2019 is to ignore the costs to women and to continue to make women\u2019s labor \ninvisible, as well as to condone that it is uncompensated.\u2019 M. Fineman, The Neutered Mother, the \nSexual Family and Other Twentieth Century Tragedies (NY and London: Routledge, 1995) 162. \n6 If our sole concern in imposing child support obligations on genetic fathers was to address gender \ninequality, then we would be far better off imposing a tax on all (childless) men. \nKent Academic Repository \u2013 http:\/\/kar.kent.ac.uk  \nPublished version available in \u2018Modern Law Review 66 (2) pp175 \u2013 194\u2019 \n- 3 - \n \n \nfeminist. Notably, conservatives frequently claim that those who do not want to \nprocreate should not have sex, or that those who fail to use contraception should \n\u2018face the consequences\u2019 of their \u2018reckless\u2019 behaviour. This argument is one which \nhas historically been used to deny access to abortion services and that should at \nleast give pause for thought before feminists or liberals choose to invoke it in this \ncontext. \n \nThis paper represents my attempt to think through the argument made by the \nmen\u2019s advocates. It is intended to provoke discussion with other feminist and \nliberal thinkers who, I suggest, should be uneasy with relying on the conservative \nargument outlined above. Consequently, for the purposes of this paper, I will take \nas given firstly that allowing women to separate sex from procreation inter alia by \nway of liberal access to abortion is a good thing, and secondly that the abortion \ndecision should belong to the pregnant woman. In the light of these assumptions, \nin what follows I will sketch the most sophisticated form of the men\u2019s advocates\u2019 \nargument before looking at some possible rebuttals which do not rely on the \ninseparability of sex and procreation. I will begin, though, by providing some \nbackground to this discussion through setting out the most commonly accepted \nethical basis for child support obligations. \n \nThe Obligation to Pay Child Support \n \nThe duty of parents to provide for the maintenance of their children, is a principle of natural \nlaw; an obligation laid on them not only by nature itself, but by their own proper act, in \nbringing them into the world; for they would be in the highest manner injurious to their \nissue, if they only gave their children life, that they might afterwards see them perish. By \nbegetting them, therefore, they have entered into a voluntary obligation, to endeavour, as far \nas in them lies, that the life which they have bestowed shall be supported and preserved. Thus \nthe children will have a perfect right of receiving maintenance from their parents.7 \n \nTo many, the assumption that genitors are obliged to provide for their children \nmay seem so obvious as to be in need of no justification.8 It can be traced back to \nbefore Blackstone who located its roots in natural law and the parents\u2019 \u2018own \nproper act, in bringing [children] into the world\u2019.9 Whilst most contemporary legal \ntheorists reject natural law as a way of grounding obligations, the idea of \nvoluntary creation of needs still seems the most plausible and commonly accepted \nexplanation of genitors\u2019 liability for child support.10 According to this idea, \n \n7 W. Blackstone, 1 Commentaries on the Laws of England (1765) n447, at 247. Blackstone himself \nwas relying on the authority of Puffendorf, Law of Nature and Nations (1688). \n8 For example, in the US case of Doughty v Engler 112 Kan 583, 584, 211 P 619 (1923), the Court \nnoted that the father\u2019s non statutory duty to support his illegitimate child has been \u2018accepted as a \nmatter of course without the assignment of any reason.\u2019 \n9 See note 7 above. \n10 For reasons of space, other possible arguments are not dealt with here. The most convincing \nwould see financial liability as operating either as a deterrent against the creation of children \noutside of a stable heterosexual quasi-marital unit, or as a punishment for having done so. But \nfeminists have argued strenuously against the prohibition of abortion on the basis that \ncontinuation of pregnancy would punish or deter women from (irresponsible) sexual behaviour. \nWhile it is clearly possible to make a distinction here on the basis that forcing someone to \ncontinue a pregnancy is qualitatively different from forcing someone to pay child support, I would \nsuggest that the better argument is that people should not be punished for extra-marital sex (or \nextra-marital creation of children) at all unless these activities can be correctly characterised as \nharmful. This is further explored below, see notes 50\u201355 and accompanying text. \nKent Academic Repository \u2013 http:\/\/kar.kent.ac.uk  \nPublished version available in \u2018Modern Law Review 66 (2) pp175 \u2013 194\u2019 \n- 4 - \n \n \n \ngenitors\u2019 obligations are grounded in an idea of consent (either to procreation \nitself or to running a risk of it). But to what is a man deemed to have consented \nand when does this consent take place? Given that an unwilling father is by \ndefinition opposing the birth of the child, the argument must be that he was \nconsenting to run the risk of pregnancy when he consented to engage in particular \nkinds of sexual activity. Thus, it is said, if men do not want to father children then \nthey have a clear choice \u2013 not to engage in those activities liable to result in \ninsemination: \nfew men \u2026 can be forced to engage in intercourse without taking appropriate precautions. \nTherefore, a responsible man who willingly engages in an act with known possible \nconsequences may fairly be held responsible for those consequences. If he is not willing to be \nheld responsible, he should not commit the act in question \u2026 The principal focus of a \ncontract concept should not rest upon a man\u2019s liability for support but upon highlighting his \nresponsibility for ensuring that conception not occur either by abstaining from intercourse or \nby taking necessary contraceptive precautions for his own protection.11 \n \nIt is on precisely this point that the men\u2019s advocates have waged their attack. \n \nAbortion as Breaking the Causal Chain Between Sex and \nProcreation \n \nIn its most sophisticated form, the claim made by some men\u2019s advocates is that \nsafe, legal abortion has challenged the inevitability of the causal link between sex \nand procreation for women and, as such, it is unfair not to allow that this chain \nmay also be broken for men in certain circumstances. This is well expressed by the \ntwo following commentators: \n \nBy legalizing abortion we gave women the right to say \u2018I know a child was conceived, but I \nrefuse to accept the parental responsibilities because I can\u2019t afford the parenthood right \nnow \u2026 or because I\u2019m not emotionally ready to handle them \u2026 or, because I want to finish \nschool or build a career first \u2026 or, maybe I just want to use my money for a new car or \nspend the next nine months in Europe \u2026 or frankly, it\u2019s none of your business. No one is \ngoing to give me parental responsibilities unless I choose to have them\u2026. We are no longer \nbeing truthful when we chide the male defendant, \u2018\u2018It took two to make the baby. It isn\u2019t fair \nfor you to leave her stuck with the problem.\u2019\u2019 It might have taken two to conceive the \nembryo, but thanks to legalized abortion, only one person controlled whether or not a baby \nwas made. Today, the only women who become mothers are women who choose consciously \nand deliberately to become mothers.12 \n \nThe traditional causal chain \u2013 intercourse, conception, birth \u2013 is seen to have a \nnew link: the conscious decision of whether to abort, inserted between conception \nand birth. The conscious decision in the former chain, the assumed mutual \ndecision of whether to have intercourse, and the risk of the consequence of \nconception and birth, are now superseded by a unilateral decision on the part of \nthe mother. The man may publicly state his wishes that the woman abort and may \neven offer to pay for the procedure, but the decision is solely the woman\u2019s. Under \n \n11 E. M. Young, \u2018Threshold Issues Associated with the Parental Obligation of Child Support\u2019 in J. \nCasserty (ed), The Parental Child-Support Obligation (Lexington Books: Lexington MA, 1983) 68. \n12 F. Hayward, \u2018Abortion Rights for Men: Some Careful Thinking About Fathers\u2019 Rights\u2019 20 \nEveryman: a Men\u2019s Journal 8 (31 August 1996) 8. \nKent Academic Repository \u2013 http:\/\/kar.kent.ac.uk  \nPublished version available in \u2018Modern Law Review 66 (2) pp175 \u2013 194\u2019 \n- 5 - \n \n \ncurrent law if the decision is negative, the man is liable to support the child under \nthe same conditions that any other child-support determination is made. Is this a \nfair and equitable situation for the man? \u2026 By so unequivocally removing the \nman from the supposed causal relationship between the decision to abort and the \nbirth of the child, it may be argued that his liability to support should take that \nfact into consideration. Specifically, the woman\u2019s decision not to abort when the \nman wishes otherwise should place the burden of support on the woman. The \nscientific possibility, medical safety and legal permissibility of abortion make this a \ntenable argument, assuming, of course, that the woman is free to choose because \nthere are no medical, religious, or other uncontrollable obstacles to that choice.13 \nThese authors have been joined by some feminists in expressing concern at the \nperceived disjuncture of men\u2019s rights and responsibilities in this context, a former \npresident of the US National Organisation of Women noting that: \n \nJustice \u2026 dictates that if a woman makes a unilateral decision to bring [a] pregnancy to \nterm, and the biological father does not, and cannot share in this decision, he should not be \nliable for 21 years of support. Or, put another way, autonomous women making independent \ndecisions about their lives should not expect men to finance their choice.14 \n \nIn other words, the state of affairs familiar to Blackstone where having sex could \nbe understood as involving consent to run the risk of procreation no longer \npertains. In agreeing to have sex, sexual partners do not necessarily agree to \nprocreate:15 \n \nMany believe that individuals\u2019 willingness to have heterosexual intercourse represents prima \nfacie evidence of their willingness to accept the financial consequences associated with a \npregnancy and possible birth. This traditional view of sexuality is inconsistent, though, with \na progressive view of consensual sex as an opportunity for personal expression and \ndevelopment, independent of reproductive needs. Sex, seen in this contemporary light, does \nnot excuse men and women from acting ethically. It merely implies that individuals who are \ncapable of financially supporting their own children should be given the opportunity to make \npersonal and informed decisions about how they wish to express their sexuality, while at the \nsame time stipulating their preferences about parenthood.16 \n \nOn this basis, some American commentators have suggested the need for new, \nconsent-based, mechanisms for the attribution of paternal rights and obligations. \nIn 1992, the US National Center for Men suggested that partners should be \nallowed to sign a \u2018Consensual Sex Contract\u2019 outlining terms under which they \nagree to have sex.17 More recently, sociologist William Marsiglio has made a \n \n13 Young, note 11 above, 62\u201363. Young goes on to express reservations about this argument, citing \neconomic disparity between men and women, the needs of children and a concern that they should \nnot become the burden of the taxpayer. See also G. Swan, \u2018Abortion on Maternal Demand: \nPaternal Support Implications\u2019 (1975) 9(2) Val U L Rev243, 265, 266; Kapp, note 1 above. \n14 Karen DeCrow, letter to the editor, New York Times Magazine (9 May 1982), cited in W. \nMarsiglio, Procreative Man (New York and London: New York University Press, 1998) 97. \n15 This leaves open the question of whether they may be consenting to run the risk of pregnancy and \ntherefore retain an obligation to share in the cost of terminating that pregnancy if it is unwanted. \n16 Marsiglio, note 14 above, 182. Note that Marsiglio would limit this ability to opt out of child \nsupport liability to situations where the woman is capable of supporting a child without male \nassistance. In the light of Marsiglio\u2019s previous argument, this is a rather curious exception which \nallows the interests of the tax payer to trump those of the genetic father, without any supporting \nargument for why this should be so. \n17 One clause reads: \u2018We\u2019re not ready to be parents now. If an unplanned pregnancy occurs, neither \nof us will try to force the other into parenthood\u2019, cited in ibid 98. \n \nKent Academic Repository \u2013 http:\/\/kar.kent.ac.uk  \nPublished version available in \u2018Modern Law Review 66 (2) pp175 \u2013 194\u2019 \n- 6 - \n \n \nsimilar argument for what he calls a Pregnancy Resolution\/Child Support \nContract.18 Taking the contractual model to greater lengths, one group of authors \nhave even argued for a legal agreement which would allow a woman also to assign \nher right to decide whether or not to terminate a pregnancy to her sexual \npartner.19 Others have argued that the male genitor should have the right to decide \nwhether to recognise a child at some point after conception, thus mirroring the \nwoman\u2019s right to decide whether or not she wishes to go ahead with pregnancy \nand to become a mother. If the man refuses to do so, it is claimed, he should \nacquire neither the rights nor the responsibilities associated with parenthood.20 In \nother words, given that safe legal abortion has made parenthood a choice for \nwomen, so too should it make it one for men. \n \nA Feminist Rebuttal? \n \nHave the men\u2019s advocates got a point? Of course, as noted above, some would \nargue that in agreeing to sex, men do agree to procreation and that it is immoral, \nirreligious or (in the rhetoric which tends to be more popular in contemporary \ntimes) \u2018irresponsible\u2019 to separate these two things. For such commentators, child \nsupport liability can serve to act as a punishment or deterrent for the unmarried, \nthe promiscuous or the otherwise sexually feckless. This is an easy move for \nconservatives, who often aim to remove or to limit abortion rights on the same \nbasis. However, these arguments are not ones which should appeal too readily to \nfeminists (or to many liberals) who have fought too hard and too long against the \noperation of this assumption with regard to women, now to accept its operation \nwith regard to men.21 Marsiglio is surely right in recognising that most commonly \npeople have sex for reasons other than procreation and feminists have typically \ngreeted legal recognition of this social fact as a good thing. \n \nIn what follows, I look at three other kinds of argument which may seem more \nappealing to feminist and liberal thinkers. The first focuses on the needs of the \nchild, the second on challenging the idea that continuing a pregnancy represents a \n\u2018choice\u2019 for women, and the third explores whether abortion decisions are \u2018special\u2019 \nin a sense which means that they cannot play the role which the men\u2019s advocates \nsuggest. \n \n18 ibid 175\u201383. \n19 P.

For example, the US group Choice for Men respond to \nthe question: \u2018Can\u2019t men avoid paying child support by just using condoms?\u2019 with an argument \noften made in defence of abortion rights: \u2018Proponents of legalizing choice for men generally \nsupport contraception, but keep in mind that condoms are unreliable. Condoms have a 16% \nannual failure rate. After just four years you can bet on having an accidental pregnancy and after \n20 years of using condoms, the chances are that a man will most likely experience not one, not \ntwo, but three accidental pregnancies!\u2019 http:\/\/www.nas.com\/c4m\/faq.html (last visited, 23 April \n2002). \nKent Academic Repository \u2013 http:\/\/kar.kent.ac.uk  \nPublished version available in \u2018Modern Law Review 66 (2) pp175 \u2013 194\u2019 \n- 7 - \n \n \nThe Needs of the Child \n \nContinuing a pregnancy will produce a child with a bundle of practical, emotional \nand financial needs. Legally, it is not open to genetic parents to bargain away the \nrights which will accrue to that child on birth and, regardless of what is said before \na pregnancy is conceived, the child\u2019s right to support cannot be waived by its \nmother.22 While it is clearly right that the mother should not be able to sign away \nrights belonging the child, however what is lacking in this argument is some \ngrounding for why the genetic father should have the responsibility for meeting \nthe needs of his children in the first place. The very issue under discussion is \nwhether there is any sustainable basis for the child to claim a right to support from \nits genetic father. What is it that grounds the right which cannot be waived? Surely \nit is not merely the genetic relationship \u2013 to note a genetic link is to state a \nbiological fact, not to present an ethical justification.23 Nor can parental \nobligations be grounded in nothing more than factual causation, that is, in the \nidea that if you create a set of needs (here by bringing a child into the world) that \nyou have a duty to meet those needs to the best of your ability. Factual causation \ndoes not fix legal or ethical duties without something more.24 Some further \nelement is necessary and Blackstone\u2019s explanation of parental obligation does \nintroduce such a further requirement \u2013 that the creation of needs is voluntary. But \nthis brings us squarely back to the men\u2019s advocates\u2019 argument that, in cases where \nthe genitor is unwilling to become a father, sex may have been voluntary but the \ncreation of a child was not. \n \nContinuing a Pregnancy is not a \u2018Choice\u2019 \n \nA second possible strategy for rebutting the men\u2019s advocates\u2019 argument lies in \nattacking its premise that the availability of safe, legal abortion makes continuing \na pregnancy a matter of \u2018choice\u2019 for women. If birth does not result from a \nvoluntary choice, then their argument fails in two possible ways: first it cannot \nbreak the causal chain between sex and procreation (as the latter would then \nappear as an inevitable consequence of the former); and secondly, they have no \nway of distinguishing between the man\u2019s and woman\u2019s relationship to the child (ie \n \n22 Child Support Act 1991, s9(3) makes it clear that child support obligations cannot be left to the \nfree will of the parents: the fact of having entered into a maintenance agreement will not preclude \na parent with care from applying for a maintenance assessment at some later date. This provision \nreflects the earlier decisions of Hulley v Thompson [1981] 1 WLR 159 and Crozier v Crozier [1994] \n1 FLR 126, 135. Similarly, the US courts have held that personal agreements concerning \ncontraception are not relevant to determinations of child support liability, which is based on the \nfinancial situation of the parents and the needs of the child. See in particular: Straub v BMT \n(1994) 645 NE 2d 597. \n23 As a matter of social fact, a lot of genetic links do not give rise to social obligation. The closest \ngenetic link you could have would be to your clone: would this of itself imply an obligation to \nsupport him or her? We do, as a matter of fact, often claim that people owe special obligations to \ndifferent categories of genetic relation, but what the cloning example suggests is that our ethical \nintuitions about obligations are grounded not in the genetic fact alone but in the social and legal \nstructure which has been built upon it. \n24 In terms of factual causation, one is created not just by one\u2019s parents but also by all one\u2019s \ngrandparents, great grandparents and beyond. Causation is an extremely complex concept which \nhas generated a vast legal and philosophical literature, but my point here is hopefully an \nuncontroversial one: that while factual causation may be necessary to ground certain kinds of \nobligations to other people, it is never sufficient to do so. For an early and influential discussion of \ncausation see: H. L .A. Hart and A. M. Honore\u00b4 , Causation in the Law (Oxford: Oxford University \nPress, 1959). \n \nKent Academic Repository \u2013 http:\/\/kar.kent.ac.uk  \nPublished version available in \u2018Modern Law Review 66 (2) pp175 \u2013 194\u2019 \n- 8 - \n \n \nif neither made a voluntary choice to procreate, then neither would be financially \nliable in child support on the basis of voluntary creation of need). \n \nDo women exercise choice when continuing a pregnancy?25 Feminists have \ncertainly relied heavily on claims to reproductive choice in campaigns around \nabortion. The \u2018Pro-Choice\u2019 movement has argued specifically to retain that name, \nwith activists repeatedly pointing out that they are not \u2018pro-abortion\u2019 but aim only \nfor appropriate support and facilitation of whatever decision a pregnant woman \nwishes to make. Feminists have criticised the Abortion Act 1967 for its \nrepresentation of maternity as an unconsidered norm or default position, with \nabortion only available for those who somehow fail to conform to the model of \nthe good mother.26 Far better, it has been argued, to emphasise pregnant women\u2019s \ncapacity to make the best decisions about their pregnancies \u2013 whether that be to \ncontinue or to end them.27 \n \nAt the same time, a major and recurring theme of feminist scholarship has been \nuneasiness with the idea of choice. This stems from a clear recognition of the role \nwhich claims of \u2018choice\u2019 have played in justifying women\u2019s continued subordination. \nFor example, women\u2019s continued inferior position in the labour market has \nbeen explained as a result of individual women\u2019s choices to prioritise home and \nfamily.28 As such, it is important to recognise that decisions are never made in a \nvacuum. In making choices, we are all influenced both by the opportunities \npresented to us and the attitudes of those with whom we interact.29 Feminists have \nalso expressed particular concern about the use of choice as a foundation for \n \n25 An interesting example of judicial approval of the idea that continuing a pregnancy represents a \npositive choice is provided by the US case of Miller v Albright 523 US 420 (1998). Here the \nSupreme Court considered a provision granting automatic US citizenship to the child of a US \nunmarried mother and an alien father, whilst requiring affirmative steps to create or confirm the \nrelationship where the child was born to a US unmarried father and alien mother. Refusing to \nstrike down this distinction as an unconstitutional gender-based classification, the majority \nreasoned: \u2018[i]f the citizen is the unmarried female, she must first choose to carry the pregnancy to \nterm and reject the alternative of abortion \u2013 an alternative that is available by law to many, and in \nreality to most, women around the world y [The law] rewards that choice and that labor by \nconferring citizenship on her child\u2019 (per Justice Stevens at 420). For the majority of the Court, the \ncontinuance of pregnancy is a positive and conscious choice implying a recognition of, and \ncommitment to, the eventual child. \n26 For example, M. Boyle, Rethinking Abortion (London: Routledge, 1997); S. Sheldon, \u2018\u2018\u2018Who is the \nMother to Make the Judgement?\u2019\u2019: the Construction of Woman in English Abortion Law\u2019 (1993) \n1 FLS 3; and S. Sheldon, Beyond Control: Medical Power and Abortion Law (London: Pluto, \n1997). \n27 See for example, S. Sheldon (1993) ibid, particularly at 22. Note that my claim here was explicitly a \nstrategic one \u2013 to construct an image of the rational, self-determining, responsible and mature \npregnant woman who can best serve the needs of the \u2018concrete women who stand behind her\u2019. \n28 \u2018The old notion that women are not intelligent enough or lack the moral accountability to be \nleaders in business, politics, or the academy has been replaced by justifications centered on \nwomen\u2019s choice. This explanation of women\u2019s disadvantage is particularly prominent in the \ndiscourse on women in the workplace. The conventional wisdom is that because women place \nmore importance on their families, they voluntarily choose to subordinate their career and job \naspirations for the sake of their children or their partners. This rationale allows employers to \nmake the paradoxical claim that women actually prefer lower-paying jobs or jobs that offer little \nopportunity for advancement.\u2019 M.

The focus upon choice masks the circumstances in which women make \ndecisions about pregnancy and childbirth.31 \n \nIn the context of pregnancy decisions, the circumstances to which Bridgeman \nmight wish to direct our attention are well known. Putting to one side the case of \nNorthern Ireland,32 while access to abortion services is relatively liberal in the \nUK, well entrenched obstacles to reproductive choice nonetheless still exist \u2013 most \nseriously for young women, women living in remote areas and ethnic minority \nwomen.33 The fact that the medical profession are gatekeepers to termination \nservices enhances doctors\u2019 control over abortion decisions.34 Other powerful \ndetermining factors will include the woman\u2019s economic situation, the difficulties of \ncombining family and work lives, and the views of her church, community, friends \nand family. Most poignantly, reports of women and girls who conceal their \npregnancies and abandon their newborn babies are a regular, if not common, news \nitem. One assumes that these women did not feel that continuing their pregnancies \nwas a \u2018choice\u2019 nor that it was possible to \u2018decide\u2019 on termination. \nIn other words, the feminist demand for \u2018reproductive choice\u2019 remains an \naspiration rather than a reality. And it can only ever remain a partial description \nof women\u2019s experience of abortion. As Fox points out: \n \nEven where a woman does have access to abortion, characterizing her action as one of \nchoosing fails to capture the complexity and ambivalence of women\u2019s responses to the \nexperience of abortion. The slogan \u2018\u2018a woman\u2019s right to choose\u2019\u2019 risks masking women\u2019s \n \n30 J. Bridgeman, \u2018A Woman\u2019s Right to Choose?\u2019 in E. Lee (ed), Abortion Law and Politics Today \n(London: Macmillan, 1998) 86. Marie Fox notes that \u2018[t]he rhetoric of choice also stems from \nliberal imagery of autonomous individuals making choices in their own self(ish) interest(s) and \nthus facilitates the characterization of the woman who seeks abortion as selfish.\u2019 M. Fox, \u2018A \nWoman\u2019s Right to Choose? A Feminist Critique\u2019 in J. Harris and S. Holm (eds), The Future of \nHuman Reproduction (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998) 81-2. Kathryn Abrams notes an \ninteresting reluctance on the part of (US) feminists to engage in a strong critique of choice in this \narea. She offers one possible, speculative explanation for this: that given women\u2019s right to choose \nis already under attack, to question the way in which women choose or to impugn their capacities \nas rational decision makers might appear reckless. See K. Abrams, \u2018Ideology and Women\u2019s \nChoices\u2019 (1989-90) 24 Ga L Rev761-801, at 786. \n31 ibid 86. \n32 See Fox\u2019s powerful critique of the use of \u2018choice\u2019 to describe women\u2019s experience of abortion \nservices in Northern Ireland, note 30 above 83-84. In a context where abortion services are so \nrestricted, it would clearly be difficult for the men\u2019s advocates to establish the first premise of their \nargument: that women have control of abortion decisions. \n33 See S. Sheldon, \u2018The Abortion Act 1967: a Critical Perspective\u2019 in E. Lee (ed), Abortion Law and \nPolitics Today (London: Macmillan, 1998) 54. This observation relies on the fact that minority \nand younger women are less likely to know their way around the health system and may be more \nsurely deterred by an unsympathetic reception from their GP. Women who live in rural areas will \nusually only have access to one GP\u2019s surgery and if that GP is hostile to abortion, then their \nsituation is also particularly difficult.

Sheldon (1997), note 26 above, especially chapter 4. \nKent Academic Repository \u2013 http:\/\/kar.kent.ac.uk  \nPublished version available in \u2018Modern Law Review 66 (2) pp175 \u2013 194\u2019 \n- 10 - \n \n \n \nproblems with abortion \u2013 in particular the fact that abortion is not a complete solution to the \nproblem of unwanted pregnancy.35 \n \nHowever, while Fox and Bridgeman both produce powerful and convincing \ncritiques of the \u2018right to choose\u2019 as a basis for feminist campaigning in this area, \ntheir analysis does not deny that many of the women who will terminate \npregnancies in Britain this year (and the many more who will continue them) will \nexercise careful, thoughtful choices. These are women with alternatives (though \ntypically none of them ideal) which are often considered and discussed at length, \nsometimes in extremely supportive, explicitly pro-choice environments.36 These \nwomen will deploy \u2018complex moral reasoning\u2019.37 They may feel deeply ambivalent \nabout their decisions and they will invariably feel constrained by a range of \nexternal influences, but so too are there influences on any significant decision \nwhich any of us ever make. The existence of these constraints does not render a \ndecision invalid. So while it is right to feel concern with the role of choice in the \nmen\u2019s advocates\u2019 argument, I do not think it is tenable to claim that the majority \nof women do not exercise choice in continuing a pregnancy. \n \nPregnancy\/Abortion Choices are \u2018Special\u2019 \n \nAlternatively, might it be possible to accept that continuing a pregnancy is a \nchoice, but to argue that it is qualitatively different from other choices in a \nsignificant sense (ie in a sense which means it cannot play the role which the men\u2019s \nadvocates suggest)? I think not, though I will briefly canvass four arguments \nwhich might be made in this regard. \n \nFirst, might it be argued that motherhood responds to a deep-rooted need or a \n\u2018natural\u2019 course of events rather than a choice? On this view, while women may \nsometimes decide to end a pregnancy, continuing a pregnancy does not involve \nchoosing but merely allowing nature to run its course. Abortion appears as an \nexception to the norm of maternity. But the appeal to biology or \u2018natural course of \nevents\u2019 in this argument is clearly problematic for feminists, who have worked \nhard precisely to establish that motherhood is not the natural or \u2018default\u2019 option \nfor women but one possibility amongst others. Feminists have criticised in the \nstrongest of terms those stereotypes relied on by doctors who advise women to go \nahead with pregnancies because their \u2018maternal instincts will inevitably take over\u2019, \nand politicians who have opposed abortion rights on the grounds that \u2018deep down\u2019 \nall women want to have children. Moreover, the want or need to have a child at \nsome point in one\u2019s life clearly does not dictate one\u2019s attitude to a given \npregnancy. Women frequently choose to terminate pregnancies because they have \noccurred at the wrong time or with the wrong partner and then go on to have \nchildren at some later date. \n \n35 See note 30 above 84. \n36 The charitable clinics, of which the British Pregnancy Advisory Service is the largest service \nprovider, were set up explicitly to provide terminations in a supportive and non-judgmental \nenvironment. There is considerable evidence to suggest that they are staffed primarily by \nindividuals who would identify as strongly pro-choice and strongly pro-women (see M. Lattimer, \nAbortion Discourses: an Exploration of the Social, Cultural and Organisational Context of Abortion \nDecision-Making in Contemporary Britain, unpublished PhD thesis, University of Sussex, 2000). \n37 Fox, note 30 above 99. \nKent Academic Repository \u2013 http:\/\/kar.kent.ac.uk  \nPublished version available in \u2018Modern Law Review 66 (2) pp175 \u2013 194\u2019 \n- 11 - \n \n \nSecondly, is the decision to continue a pregnancy significantly different because \nreproduction is a fundamental human right? The right to found a family is \ncertainly a staple ingredient of human rights treaties and is commonly interpreted \nto include reproductive rights. But the received interpretation of a right to \nreproduce has been as a negative right, a right that others should not seek to \nprevent us from pursuing our own reproductive goals, for example, by forced \ntermination or compulsory sterilisation. We do not generally believe that someone \nelse has a duty to supply women with sperm or sexual partners so that we can \nrealise our right to reproduce. Nor do we believe that a man has the right to force \na woman to continue with an unwanted pregnancy so that he can achieve his \ndream of becoming a father. Should we then believe that male partners have a \nduty to finance a woman\u2019s fundamental right to reproduce? I would argue that to \ncontinue a pregnancy should surely be accepted as a human right in the sense of \nimplying important negative duties of non-interference, but that the right to \ncontinue a pregnancy is not typically understood as a human right giving rise to \npositive duties on the part of other individuals.38 \n \nThirdly, the men\u2019s advocates might be attacked for assuming that men\u2019s and \nwomen\u2019s relationships to reproduction are equivalent, when clearly they are not.39 \nAt the heart of the men\u2019s advocates\u2019 argument lies the claim that since parenthood \nis now a choice for women, so too should it be a choice for men. Yet whilst men \nand women may share the same genetic interests in procreation, there is clearly no \nmale equivalent for women\u2019s interest in gestation. It is this fundamental \nasymmetry in the nature of reproduction which is often taken as grounding \nwomen\u2019s rights to choose to terminate (or to continue) a pregnancy in the face of \nmale opposition: since a pregnancy is occurring within the woman\u2019s body, that \nwoman has a special claim to control its outcome. The legal significance of this \ngestational interest can clearly be seen in a comparison of the law dealing with the \ndisposal of frozen embryos and access to abortion respectively.40 As in the UK, \nthe American courts have guarded women\u2019s right to decide on the outcome of a \npregnancy against the claims of their male partners. However, where the issue is \none of disposition of embryos existing outside the woman\u2019s body, the US courts \nhave deemed the man\u2019s interest in avoiding procreation to outweigh the woman\u2019s \ninterest in reproduction.41 So while an asymmetry based on the woman\u2019s \ngestational labour can be advanced as a powerful argument in support of women\u2019s \n \n38 Though it may be taken to imply certain duties on the part of the state: eg to provide adequate \nmedical services, provision for maternity leave and so on. \n39 I am grateful to one of the MLR\u2019s anonymous referees for this argument. \n40 See Davis v Davis (1992) 842 SW 2d 588. \u2018If no prior agreement [regarding disposition of the \nembryos] exists, then the relative interests of the parties in using or not using the preembryos must \nbe weighed. Ordinarily, the party wishing to avoid procreation should prevail, assuming that the \nother party has a reasonable possibility of achieving parenthood by means other than use of the \npreembryos in question.\u2019 See note 4 above for the actions brought by men attempting to prevent \n(former) partners from terminating pregnancies. \n41 Provided that the woman has a reasonable possibility of achieving parenthood by other means. In \nDavis, Mrs Davis was intending to donate the embryos to another woman and therefore was not \nasserting an interest in achieving parenthood for herself, ibid. The same point may soon be tested \nin the UK. A woman who lost her ovaries to cancer has announced her intention to go to court to \nstop frozen embryos created from gametes taken from her and her former partner from being \ndestroyed on his request. Her chances of success are negligible. As a spokeswoman from the \nHuman Fertilisation and Embryology Authority correctly noted: \u2018[f]or an embryo to be used in a \ntreatment cycle both partners who created the embryo must consent to treatment and storage. So \nif the man does not consent to treatment, the treatment can\u2019t take place. There is no room for \nnegotiation under the law.\u2019 See The Guardian, 3 August 2002, and the Human Fertilisation and \nEmbryology Act 1990, Sched 3, s 4 which provides for variation and withdrawal of consent to the \nuse of stored embryos. \nKent Academic Repository \u2013 http:\/\/kar.kent.ac.uk  \nPublished version available in \u2018Modern Law Review 66 (2) pp175 \u2013 194\u2019 \n- 12 - \n \n \nrights to control the outcome of a pregnancy, it is not clear how this would serve \nto ground the child support obligations of individual male genitors.42 Indeed, the \nmen\u2019s advocates might claim here that they do recognise the asymmetry in men\u2019s \nand women\u2019s relationships to procreation (in recognising women\u2019s abortion \nrights), but are merely calling for a corresponding asymmetry in men\u2019s and \nwomen\u2019s obligations to resulting children. \n \nFourthly and finally, there will obviously be some situations where women can \nargue with considerable force that, notwithstanding the legality of abortion, the \nchoice to end a pregnancy is not open to them. Most obviously, some women have \nstrong moral or religious views which militate against abortion. A strict Catholic \nwho sincerely believes that termination is morally equivalent to murder might \nargue that she does not have the choice to end her pregnancy. But there are two \nproblems with this argument. First, the claim that choices should not count as \nsuch when they are based on one\u2019s most strongly held fundamental religious and \nmoral views has important counter-intuitive results.43 For example, if people \nmarry then this would not count as a choice where they desire matrimony on the \nbasis of deeply held religious convictions but it would count as a choice where \ntheir decision is motivated by a desire to improve their tax situation.44 Secondly, \nthis argument also raises the issue of whether an individual\u2019s moral or religious \nbelief should be allowed to impact on other parties in harmful ways. As one men\u2019s \nadvocate notes: \n \nsome pregnant women feel compelled to bear unwanted children because they believe \nabortion to be murder. Nevertheless, the power to make that choice is one more power that \nwomen take for granted and most men dare not imagine. Thousands of men who also believe \nthat abortion is murder have had to stand by helplessly and, from their perspective, watch \ntheir children be murdered. They only wish that they had an equivalent legal right to protect \nthe lives of their own unborn children, whether the conception was planned or not.45 \n \nNo woman should be forced to have a termination against her will whether her \ndesire to continue a pregnancy is motivated by religious beliefs or not. The \nargument here, though, would require that one\u2019s religious belief could be \nadvanced against an unwilling putative father as a justification for grounding \nsubstantial financial liability on his part, and this seems unconvincing. \n \nWhere does this leave us? To argue that women do not exercise a choice when \ncontinuing with a pregnancy risks denying women\u2019s agency and reinforcing \nnegative stereotypes of maternity as the female norm with abortion justified only \nby exceptional circumstances. Feminists, in particular, have argued that pregnant \nwomen are the best abortion decision-makers, that women have the moral \n \n42 Take a different example. Imagine that ova removed consensually from Anne are implanted into \nBrinda. We would probably think (and the law would suggest) that Anne has no right to demand \nthat Brinda should terminate the pregnancy. However, we would also probably think (and again \nthe law would concur) that the existence of a genetic link between Anne and the eventual child \nshould not per se ground any obligation on Anne\u2019s part to support it. Rather, in determining the \nexistence of such moral obligations on Anne\u2019s part, we might want to examine the circumstances \nof conception more closely, and possibly to draw a distinction between a situation where Anne \nand Brinda are partners who have together requested this procedure in order to bear a child who \nhas a biological relationship to both of them, and a second scenario where Brinda has acquired the \nova without Anne\u2019s knowledge. My point is that whilst Anne and Brinda\u2019s interests in the \npregnancy cannot be treated as equivalent, merely this observation combined with knowledge of a \ngenetic link between Anne and the child cannot per se ground any moral support obligation on \nAnne\u2019s part. \n43 I thank Stephen Wilkinson for this argument. \n44 Here I leave open the issue of to what extent moral and religious beliefs should in any case be \nunderstood as the result of choice. \n45 See note 12 above. \nKent Academic Repository \u2013 http:\/\/kar.kent.ac.uk  \nPublished version available in \u2018Modern Law Review 66 (2) pp175 \u2013 194\u2019 \n- 13 - \n \n \nintegrity necessary to make our own reproductive decisions, and that choosing to \ncontinue or to end a pregnancy are equally valid decisions. On the other hand, to \nargue that women are strong and capable decision-makers who are able to deploy \n\u2018complex moral reasoning\u2019 in determining our own best interests and those of our \npotential children seems to allow no basis for refuting the men\u2019s advocates\u2019 \nargument. The currently accepted grounding of child support liability in voluntary \ncreation of need suggests no possibility for opposing the view that mothers should \nbe solely financially liable for children where their sexual partners are unwilling to \nbecome fathers. \n \nRethinking the Basis for Support Obligations \n \nIf the analysis above is right, then it seems that the received basis for child support \nliability (voluntary creation of need) may suggest only holding so liable those \nfathers who are willing to be recognised as such. This is clearly a worrying \nconclusion. As noted above, female headed households are already clearly the \npoorest in the UK, with a substantial proportion of them already living in \npoverty.46 Limiting men\u2019s obligation to provide financial support for their genetic \nchildren can only exacerbate already marked gendered disparities in wealth.47 Yet \nwithout an ethical basis for holding unwilling fathers privately liable to support \ntheir children, there is nothing to justify sacrificing the interests of these particular \nmen in order to allay our rightful concern on the issue of child and female poverty. \nHowever our analysis cannot stop here and, in what follows, I seek to extend it \nin a number of ways. Firstly, I assess the implications of the above argument and \nfind that they are more far reaching than they might at first appear, extending well \nbeyond the non-resident fathers who are typically targeted as problematic in \ndiscussions of child support. It is my contention that these consequences are so \nprofound and so damaging when followed through to their inevitable conclusions \nthat they provide new impetus for questioning the attempt to provide for \nchildren\u2019s basic needs through private support obligations. Secondly and more \ngenerally, I argue that voluntary creation of need is in any case highly problematic \nand should, at least, be extremely controversial as an ethical basis for grounding \nthe support obligations of any parent. Thirdly, and briefly, I move on to assess \nwhat new light the analysis of this paper may shed on a very old debate: whether \nchild support is best understood as a private or a collective obligation. \n \nUnwilling Fathers\u2019 (Lack of ) Support Obligations: Some Practical \nConsequences \n \nI have argued above that unwilling fathers are not captured by the received basis \nfor private support obligations: voluntary creation of need. To assess the \nimplications of this claim obviously requires consideration of who would count as \nan \u2018unwilling\u2019 father. Bearing in mind my starting premise \u2013 that we need to \nseparate consent to sex from consent to procreation \u2013 then unwilling fathers are \n \n46 See note 5 above. \n47 Although such exacerbation may be more due to alleviating male poverty than to increasing that \nof women: much of what is paid in child support goes to the Treasury rather than to mothers, \nwhilst many men are made poorer by virtue of paying child support. See further below. \nKent Academic Repository \u2013 http:\/\/kar.kent.ac.uk  \nPublished version available in \u2018Modern Law Review 66 (2) pp175 \u2013 194\u2019 \n- 14 - \n \n \nthose who (regardless of whether or not they consented to sex) did not voluntarily \ncreate a particular child. In other words, for our purposes, unwilling fathers are \nthose who did not choose for a particular pregnancy to continue. In practical \nterms, this would suggest the need for some formal process of recognition of \npaternity.48 In cases where no formal process of recognition has been completed, it \nwould have to be assumed that men had not decided to create a child.49 Would it \nmake any difference that a man had already evidenced some long-term \ncommitment to a particular woman by virtue of, say, cohabitation, joint purchase \nof a home or marriage? I would say not. Cohabitation and marriage are entered \ninto for any number of reasons and, whilst a commitment to have and to raise \nchildren may be among these, it cannot be assumed to be a motivating factor for \nmost people. Every man, then, would need to make some positive act of \nrecognition to trigger his support obligations. Thus, whilst the analysis above has \nfocussed on a particular group of men who have been most loudly proclaimed as \nfaring badly in the context of the current system, the ambit of the argument \ninevitably extends far beyond them. \n \nAt this point, a number of practical outcomes should become clear. First, \ndistinguishing between willing and unwilling fathers (as I have argued is necessary \nif we are to make sense of grounding support obligations on voluntary creation of \nneed) would provide a powerful financial incentive for men to disown their \nbiological children in order to avoid onerous support liability. In cases where child \nsupport obligations would then pass to the taxpayer, there would often be an \nincentive for women to collude in this process (perhaps on the promise of the \ninformal provision of extra financial or other forms of support from the father). \nSecondly, where a woman is reluctant to reveal the existence of a pregnancy to a \nsexual partner, she would prevent the crystallisation of the child\u2019s right to recoup \nsupport payments. Thirdly, there would be considerable scope for putative fathers \nto apply extreme pressure on pregnant women at what is a peculiarly vulnerable \ntime, using recognition of the eventual child as a bargaining chip. That some \nwomen would be pressurised into terminating pregnancies is inevitable. Finally, \nthe fact that many more men would find themselves free from child support \nliability could only exacerbate the existing disparity of wealth between men and \nwomen and, given that children usually live with their mothers and are dependent \non their mother\u2019s standard of living, then child welfare is likely to suffer. \nAs such, carrying the analysis of the first half of this paper through to its logical \nconclusion would clearly result in what most people would see as strongly negative \nconsequences and fly against many popular social policy aims. Men would be \nencouraged to become less involved in their families; abortion of potentially \nwanted children would be encouraged; gendered disparities in wealth would be \nfurther entrenched; and child poverty would be exacerbated. Do these negative \noutcomes reveal a flaw in the analysis of the first part of this paper? Surely not. \nThe problem which I have outlined above remains \u2013 if there is no sustainable \nethical grounding for fixing liability for child support on unwilling fathers, then \nsuch a grounding cannot be found in noting the exacerbation of the general social \nproblems set out above. Without more, the general desire to tackle a given social \nproblem does not provide any ethical justification for why responsibility for \n \n48 See the suggestions made by the commentators at notes 17\u201318 above and accompanying text. \n49 This fits with the idea that the recognition must be \u2018voluntary\u2019. For the assumption to operate the \nother way would be unworkable, not least because it would only make sense when combined with \na positive obligation on women to inform a man of the existence of a pregnancy. Of course, this \nleaves open the possibility of a later act of recognition. \nKent Academic Repository \u2013 http:\/\/kar.kent.ac.uk  \nPublished version available in \u2018Modern Law Review 66 (2) pp175 \u2013 194\u2019 \n- 15 - \n \n \naddressing it should fall on particular individuals, rather than other people, the \nstate, the general population as a whole or no one at all. \n \nMore General Problems with \u2018Voluntary Creation of Need\u2019 as a Basis \nfor Child Support Obligations \n \nOver and above these concerns, it seems that there are two more general problems \nwith grounding child support obligations in voluntary creation of need which \nshould lead liberals and feminists to treat it with extreme caution. These problems \nexist with regard not just to unwilling fathers, but with regard to all parents. \nFirstly, it must be noted that voluntary creation of need does not always lead to \nfinancial responsibility. If I am a Good Samaritan who saves a drowning child, or \na skilled doctor who prolongs the life of one of my patients into a happily \nextended old age, have I created those individuals\u2019 future needs? In a factually \ncausal sense, surely I have: my actions were essential to ensuring their (continued) \nexistence. But for my intervention, they would be dead. Should I then be obliged \nto meet (part of ) the costs of their care? Presumably we would want to say not. \nWhat these examples suggest is that voluntary creation of need is only convincing \nas a basis for financial liability when such need results from harm to third \nparties.50 And if so, it is, at the very least, controversial as a basis for liability in \nthis context. As a general rule, the birth of a child is not believed to be harmful \neither to the child itself or to its parents.51 Is it harmful to society? This question \ntakes us straight to the heart of a familiar debate between liberal and conservative \ncommentators, as the latter do often protest that the births of certain children \n(typically those born to \u2018non-traditional\u2019 family forms, or heterosexual couples \nwho are unmarried or financially unable to support them) are a profound social \nharm. For example, the conservative US commentator, Charles Murray has \nargued that \u2018[i]llegitmacy is the single most important social problem of our time \u2013 \nmore important than crime, drugs, poverty, illiteracy, welfare or homelessness \nbecause it drives everything else\u2019.52 But progressive commentators in general, and \nfeminists in particular, have tended strenuously to oppose this argument. \nWhether higher delinquency rates, drug use and educational under-achievement \nare the result of living in a single parent family or the result of the economic \nhardship experienced by most such families, remains a hotly contested \n \n50 This seems to be accepted by Blackstone who notes that \u2018it would be in the highest manner \ninjurious to their issue, if [parents] gave their children life, that they might otherwise see them \nperish\u2019, note 7 above. To be clear: my point here is that creation of harm (as opposed to mere \nneed) is a necessary condition of moral and legal obligation, not that it is a sufficient one. The \npolice surely harm the felon who is convicted and consequently loses her job as a result of their \ndetection work, but provided that they have carried out their functions in an appropriate and \nlawful manner, they owe neither legal nor ethical duties to make reparation. \n51 Along with most Western jurisdictions, the English courts have refused to recognise an action in \nwrongful life and have recently restricted the action for wrongful birth, limiting damages payable \non the birth of a healthy child to pain and suffering during pregnancy, see respectively McKay v \nEssex Area Health Authority [1982] QB 1166 and McFarlane and Another v Tayside Health Board \n[2000] 2 AC 59. Parkinson v St James and Seacroft University Hospital NHS Trust [2001] 3 WLR \n376 and Rees v Darlington Memorial Hospital NHS Trust [2002] 2 All ER 177 (CA) establish \nlimited exceptions to this rule in the context of the wrongful birth action where either the child or \nthe mother is disabled. Some commentators argue that it is better for a child to be born in the \ncontext of a nuclear family but this clearly does not establish that a given child is harmed by its \nown birth (as the alternative to this birth is not birth into a different family environment but nonexistence). \n52 C. Murray, \u2018The Coming White Underclass\u2019 Wall Street Journal, October 1993. \nKent Academic Repository \u2013 http:\/\/kar.kent.ac.uk  \nPublished version available in \u2018Modern Law Review 66 (2) pp175 \u2013 194\u2019 \n- 16 - \n \n \nissue.53 Moreover, feminist writers have argued that even if the birth of children \ncan impose certain financial costs which individual parents will be unable to meet, \nchildren represent not just costs and needs but also the future wealth and \ncontinuation of society.54 In other words, the newborn babies of today (whether \nthey be born to married parents or not) are the plumbers, nurses and refuse \ncollectors of tomorrow. If parents derive a benefit from children, so too will \nsociety as a whole. This is true if we accept either a general societal interest in the \ncontinuation of the species, or our own individual interests as the dependent \nelderly of the future who will need a younger generation to care for us.55 The \naccuracy of conceptualising the birth of children as a \u2018harm\u2019, therefore, is far from \nestablished. \n \nSecondly, it should likewise be recognised that our current practices are \nimportantly inconsistent regarding the relevance of voluntary creation of need for \nsupport obligations. Adults in need of financial support were once just as surely \nand just as voluntarily created by their parents. However, we do not legally oblige \nparents to carry on supporting their offspring who have attained the age of \nmajority and who have left full time education.56 Historically, when minors were \nseen as the property of their parents a distinction between adult and minor \nchildren made some sense. Today we have rejected the idea that parents \u2018own\u2019 \ntheir children and enjoy complete and unfettered rights over them,57 in favour of \nunderstanding children as citizens (albeit citizens with particular vulnerabilities \nand needs). To a greater or lesser extent, western democracies have recognised a \nstate interest in protecting and nurturing children. This interest has been used to \njustify intervention to protect children from neglectful or abusive parents, to \ndemand that children are adequately educated, and to ensure that they receive \nnecessary medical treatment. These measures are all based on the belief that \nchildren are individual members of society with independent rights. If we see \ndependent adults as the responsibility of society, why then do we assume \ndependent children are the responsibility of their parents? Voluntary creation of \nneed does not help us here.58 \n \n53 S. McLanahan and G. Sandefur, Growing up with a Single Parent: What Hurts, What Helps \n(Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press, 1994). \n54 See in particular Fineman, note 5 above. \n55 Here it could be countered that while the birth of some children is good for society, current birth \nrates may be producing more future citizens than we (current citizens with projected needs) \nactually require. Remaining agnostic on the empirical question, if it is accepted that a certain level \nof reproduction is socially necessary I would suggest that, even if current birth rates are deemed \ntoo high, there are good other reasons (notably concerns for procreative autonomy) not to allow \nthe state to regulate who may reproduce. \n56 See N. Wikely, \u2018Children and Social Security Law\u2019 in J. Fionda (ed), Legal Concepts of Childhood \n(Oxford: Hart Publishing, 2001) for an overview of the position of children within the social \nsecurity system highlighting the \u2018paradoxes and conflicts in the law\u2019s treatment of children and \nyoung people as nascent full members of the community\u2019, 223. \n57 J. Montgomery, \u2018Children as Property?\u2019 (1998) 51 MLR 323. \n58 Neither does the claim that a child is merely a life-style choice which therefore remains its parents\u2019 \nprivate financial responsibility, as would a new car or expensive holiday. Fineman refers to the \nidea that children are like any other consumer item as the \u2018Porsche preference\u2019: M. Fineman, \n\u2018Cracking the Foundational Myths: Independence, Autonomy and Self-Sufficiency\u2019 (2000) 8 Am \nU Jo Gender, Soc Pol\u2019y and L 13, 21. \u2018This [quasi-economic] argument states that if someone \nprefers a child, this preference should not be treated differently than any other choice (like the \nchoice to own a Porsche). Society should not subsidize either preference. I hope the societypreserving \nnature of children helps to distinguish that preference from the whim of the auto-fan.\u2019 \nKent Academic Repository \u2013 http:\/\/kar.kent.ac.uk  \nPublished version available in \u2018Modern Law Review 66 (2) pp175 \u2013 194\u2019 \n- 17 - \n \n \nPrivate or Collective Responsibility for Meeting Children\u2019s Needs? \n \nWhether children are (primarily) a collective or individual responsibility is an old \ndebate which has generated a large literature too vast to discuss here.59 Without \naspiring to resolve this issue, I do believe that the analysis of this paper has \nsomething new to offer our thinking on it. This contribution lies in challenging the \ncommon assumption that it makes sense to talk about parents in general, and nonresident \nfathers in particular, owing moral support obligations towards their \nchildren. The analysis above has shown that, for those who are not happy to rely \non a conservative vision of sex (where consenting to sex also inevitably entails \nconsenting to procreation), the received justification for private child support \nobligations must fail. If this moral obligation cannot be assumed then this creates \nserious problems for those feminists and liberals who argue for a model of support \nliability which is rooted in private responsibility. In the light of the above analysis, \nthe frequently voiced question of \u2018why should I take responsibility for other \npeople\u2019s children when the father is in a position to support them?\u2019 simply makes \nno sense. If there is no ethical grounding for individual paternal responsibility for \nmany children then anger against \u2018absent fathers\u2019 who \u2018offload\u2019 their responsibility \nonto taxpayers is ungrounded \u2013 there is no parental obligation to be thus evaded. \nThis leaves the feminist or liberal unable to locate a solution to the problem of the \npoverty of children and mothers within a privatised model of support obligations. \nTwo final points of precision are necessary before I conclude. First, whilst \narguing against the assumption that children\u2019s basic needs can be seen as a private \nobligation, I have said nothing about the many extras which parents often choose \nto provide for their children such as designer clothes, riding lessons, private \neducation, or expensive holidays abroad. Should the cost of these items now also \nfall to the taxpayer? Whilst private models of child support have tended to reflect \nthe parents\u2019 income on the grounds that children have a right to share in their \nparents\u2019 standard of living, it seems to me that this is a clearly inappropriate model \nto use for public support obligations for two reasons. First, such a model would \nserve to redistribute income towards the richest households: children in wealthier \nfamilies might claim an expectation to attend expensive public schools and private \nhospitals while children in the poorest families clearly could not. Secondly, such a \nmodel remains premised on the nuclear family (where children share in the wealth \nof two genetic parents). This can no longer be taken as representative of the \ndiversity of family arrangements in existence and, in any case, has no defensible \nrole in the allocation of state benefits. I see no justification for suggesting that a \nchild born following its mother\u2019s liaison with a wealthy oil tycoon should be able \nto claim more in support payments from the state than a second child conceived \nduring her liaison with the tycoon\u2019s poorly paid gardener.60 \n \nSecondly, my contention that the state\u2019s responsibilities should be set at the level \nof provision of the child\u2019s basic needs leaves open the question of whether children \n \n59 See R. Lister, \u2018Child Support: Boundaries of Responsibility\u2019 (1984) 11 Benefits Sept\/Oct 1 and J. \nLewis (ed), Lone Mothers in European Welfare Regimes (London: Jessica Kingsley, 1997) for a \nuseful overview of the different models currently in operation. Lister identifies two basic models \nwhich she describes as the Anglo-American model (where market driven public policies have \ndepressed family benefits and placed child-rearing firmly in the private domain) and a European \nmodel (where governments have strengthened safety nets for families with children). \n60 This accords with the argument made above regarding the inconsistency of our treatment of \nchildren and dependent adults. The state\u2019s responsibility towards the latter requires meeting basic \nneeds, not the provision of luxuries. If someone else, however, chooses to buy a holiday or \nexpensive clothes for a less wealthy friend, then this is strictly her own concern. \nKent Academic Repository \u2013 http:\/\/kar.kent.ac.uk  \nPublished version available in \u2018Modern Law Review 66 (2) pp175 \u2013 194\u2019 \n- 18 - \n \n \nshould also acquire additional enforceable rights against their parents for \na higher level of private support. Although I do not have the space fully to \nexplore this point here, it seems to me that there may be an argument for \nallowing such rights to additional support to be acquired either by virtue of a \npositive act of recognition or, in some limited circumstances, on the \nbasis of the parent\u2019s actions. For example, imagine a case where a father pays \nfor his children to enter an expensive public school but attempts to stop \npaying the fees on divorcing the children\u2019s mother. One might argue \nhere that, regardless of whether the father has formally recognised \na support obligation towards his children, he has acquired an obligation \nto pay these fees by his virtue of his children\u2019s legitimate expectation \nthat he would continue to meet an expense that he had voluntarily \nassumed. It could be harmful to the children, and certainly not consistent with \ntheir best interests, to be withdrawn from a school where they were \nsucceeding well or to be forced to take a drastic cut in living where continued \nmaintenance lies within the means of the father. Full consideration of the \npossibility of grounding obligations in such a way, however, must remain the \nconcern of another paper. \n \nConclusions \n \nThe beggarly question of parentage \u2013 what is it after all? What does it matter, \nwhen you come to think of it, whether a child is yours by blood or not? All of the little \nones of our time are collectively the children of us adults of the time, and entitled to our \ngeneral care.61 \n \nThis paper has attempted a feminist analysis of the claim that it is unfair to hold \nmen financially liable for their genetic children when they have no legal right to \nparticipate in abortion decisions. Staying within the confines of the privatised \nmodel of child support (with its premise that children are the financial \nresponsibility of individual genetic parents on the basis of voluntary creation of \nneed), I failed to uncover a convincing basis for imposing support obligations on \nunwilling fathers. Thinking more generally, I argued that voluntary creation of \nneed cannot offer feminists and liberals a workable basis for thinking about \nsupport obligations. To make this argument, I first fleshed out the practical \nimplications of the current analysis for a system of child support grounded in this \nway, before moving on to expose voluntary creation of need to a more general \nprincipled critique. \n \nReturning to my starting point, the question of how to respond to the men\u2019s \nadvocates\u2019 argument remains. Within the framework of privatised support \nobligations, I have found their argument to be more convincing than \nmost have previously allowed. It has been my contention, however, that our \ninquiry cannot stop with this observation and that the ethical indefensibility of \nvoluntary creation of need as a basis for support obligations should be \nunderstood as a reason for rejecting the private model of support obligations \nfor meeting children\u2019s basic needs in favour of a stronger emphasis on \ncollective responsibilities. It is my contention, then, that the state has a \n \n61 T.

Currently, across the \nwestern world, primary responsibility for childcare is assumed by women. When a \nprivatised model of child support liability is combined with a clearly gendered \nstructure of primary responsibility for children then it can be no surprise when \nfemale poverty results. And when this state of affairs is further exacerbated by the \nother factors which contribute to the feminisation of poverty (such as \ndiscrimination in the workplace and gendered educational and career expectations), \nthen it is entirely predictable that child welfare will suffer. Leaving children \ndependent on the economic means of their parents has contributed significantly to \nthe widespread poverty of women and children and, in countries where the \nwealth to rectify this situation exists, this should be cause for national \nshame.63 Moreover, attempting to address the poverty of women and children \nby entrenching their reliance on a male provider is problematic in societies \nwhere ever larger numbers of families do not conform to the nuclear family norm. \nFurther, it relies on the identification of single motherhood as a form \nof deviance, in need of correction by binding women and children to a male \nbreadwinner,64 with the legally coerced (re)establishment of paternal presence, \n\u2018physically outside yet metaphysically completing, the family structure\u2019.65 \nThis is a clear attempt to enforce one view of the \u2018good life\u2019 on those who \nchoose to live according to other visions and serves as a final and compelling \nreason for feminists and liberals to reject the model of privatised support \nobligations. \n \nIn the UK, whilst the Child Support Agency has been subject to vociferous \ncriticism, this has tended to focus on detailing its \u2018catastrophic administrative \nfailure\u2019.66 Specifically its inefficiency in collection of support payments, unfairness \nin the method of calculating the level of support owed, and clear prioritisation of \nreducing public expenditure by recouping money paid out in welfare benefits have \n \n62 While this may sound utopian, a non-means tested payment made automatically to every child \n(via his or her carer) would save large amounts of money currently spent on administering the \ncurrent system of child support, which has been widely pilloried for its cost and inefficiency. At the \nend of 1996, the Social Security Select Committee reported that the cumulative savings achieved \nby the Child Support Agency in terms of social security expenditure amounted to d1.74 billion \nwhilst the administrative costs of the Agency came to d660 million in its first four years of \noperation: G. Davis, N. Wikely and R. Young with J. Barron and J. Bedward, Child Support in \nAction (Oxford: Hart Publishing, 1998) 213, see also note 67 below. Obviously any administrative \nsavings would not fully meet the greater cost of the proposed system, but my point is precisely to \nargue that the costs of child care should be redistributed from genetic parents to tax payers. \n63 Leaving children so dependent also stands as a major obstacle to the Labour Government\u2019s \n\u2018historic aim\u2019 to end child poverty forever within a generation.
