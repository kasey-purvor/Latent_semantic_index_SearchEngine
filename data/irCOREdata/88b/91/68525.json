The results are shown to be in good agreement with a theoretical\ndescription based on linear response theory and the fluctuation dissipation theorem. It is\nargued that SR is a general phenomenon that can in principle occur for any underdamped\nnonlinear oscillator.\nPACS: 05.40+j, 78.50.-w, 05.20.Dd\n1\nPublished in J. Phys. A: Mat. Gen. 26, L385-390 (1993).\nStochastic resonance (SR) is widely perceived as a phenomenon peculiar to bistable\nsystems in which, under appropriate conditions, a weak periodic signal can be amplified\nby the introduction of external noise. It has been studied in a variety of contexts including\nmeteorology [1], lasers [2], passive optical systems [3], electron spin resonance (ESR) [4],\nelectronic circuits [5, 6] and a magnetoelastic ribbon [7]; arguably it is also of relevance\nto the function of sensory neurons [8]. In all of these cases, the mechanism [9] of stochas-\ntic amplification depends on the onset, for appropriate noise intensity, of quasi-periodic\nfluctuational transitions between coexisting attractors corresponding to the minima of a\nstatic bistable potential. At first sight, therefore, it would appear that there are pow-\nerful a priori reasons to suppose that SR cannot occur at all unless the system under\nstudy possesses at least two coexisting attractors; but we will demonstrate below that\nthe conventional wisdom is wrong. In this Letter we develop a rather different and much\nmore general perception of SR that shows, remarkably, that the phenomenon need not\nbe confined to static bistable (or multistable) systems but can also manifest itself, for\nexample, in a class of monostable nonlinear oscillators.\nWe propose that candidate systems in which to seek new forms of SR may readily be\nidentified through the perception of SR as a linear response phenomenon [6]. In practice,\none should seek systems which, when driven by Gaussian white noise, exhibit one or more\nwell-defined sharp maxima in the spectral densities Q0(\u03c9) of their fluctuations (SDFs) in\nthe absence of the periodic force. In those cases where the SDF close to such a maximum\nincreases rapidly with noise intensity T, the fluctuation dissipation theorem [10] implies\nthat the susceptibility of the system must also be increasing with T, and a manifestation\nof SR is therefore to be expected when the weak periodic force is added to the system.\n(In this scenario, conventional SR is associated with the zero-frequency SDF peak [15]\n2\ncorresponding to inter-well hopping within the static bistable potential.)\nThe advantages and disadvantages of the linear response theory (LRT) approach to SR\nhave already been rehearsed elsewhere [11]. Nonetheless, it may be worth repeating that\nthe disadvantage of LRT is that it is only applicable when (as is often the case in practice)\nthe periodic force is weak. Of its many advantages we would emphasize here only that, in\ncontrast to other theories of SR (e.g. [12-14]), LRT avoids the problem of non-stationarity\nby calculating the susceptibility from Q0(\u03c9) in the absence of the periodic force.\nAn example of a promising monostable candidate system in which to seek SR, which\nfulfills [16] the criteria proposed above, is provided by the single-well Duffing oscillator\ndriven by Gaussian white noise plus a weak periodic force\nq\u00a8 + 2\u0393q\u02d9 +\ndU(q)\ndq\n= f(t) + A cos \u2126t (1)\nU(q) =\n1\n2\nq2 +\n1\n4\nq4 +Bq\n\u0393\u001c 1, \u3008f(t)\u3009 = 0\n\u3008f(t)f(t\u2032)\u3009 = 4\u0393T\u03b4(t\u2212 t\u2032)\nWe consider two distinct cases, depending on the magnitude of |B|. In case (a), |B| <\n0.43, the variation of the oscillator\u2019s eigenfrequency \u03c9(E) with energy E measured from\nthe bottom of the potential well is monotonic [16], as sketched in Fig 1(a). In the absence\nof the periodic force (A = 0), for small noise intensity T , a narrow Lorentzian peak of width\n\u223c \u0393 occurs in the SDF at frequency \u03c9(0). As T is increased, the average energy E of the\n3\noscillator rises, and the peak broadens asymmetrically [16] towards higher frequencies. For\nan \u2126 > \u03c9(0), initially on the tail of the peak i.e. [\u2126\u2212\u03c9(0)] > \u0393, the magnitude of Q0(\u2126)\ntherefore increases very rapidly (approximately exponentially) with T . The corresponding\nincrease in the generalised susceptibility \u03c7(\u2126) of the system implied by the fluctuation\ndissipation theorem [10] means, in turn, that a weak periodic force on the right hand side\nof (1) will be amplified by an increase of T . Surprising though it may seem at first sight,\nSR is therefore to be anticipated in (1) even though the system is monostable, with U(q)\na smooth single-well potential. The resonance maximum is to be expected when T has\nbeen \u201ctuned\u201d to adjust E such that \u03c9(E) \u223c \u2126. This argument is extremely general and\ncan obviously be applied, perhaps with minor variations, to any underdamped nonlinear\noscillator.\nIn case (b) with |B| > 0.43, on the other hand, \u03c9(E) is nonmonotonic [16], as sketched\nin Fig 1(b). In the absence of the periodic force (A = 0), the system exhibits noise-\ninduced spectral narrowing [16]; and, for sufficiently small values of the damping constant\n\u0393, exceedingly sharp zero-dispersion spectral peaks (ZDPs) of width \u221d \u0393 12 appear [17]\nclose to the frequency \u03c9m of the extremum where d\u03c9(E)\/dE = 0. The magnitude of the\nZDP rises exponentially with increasing T. Just as in case (a) the corresponding rapid\nincrease of \u03c7(\u2126) implies a manifestation of SR for \u2126 close to \u03c9m. The extreme narrowness\nof the ZDP [17] suggests that SR in case (b) will be a much more dramatic phenomenon\nthan in case (a). [Clearly, a case (a) type resonance can also be obtained by making\n\u2126 > \u03c9(0), even when |B| > 0.43.]\nTo test these predictions, we have sought evidence of SR in an electronic model of (1)\ndesigned, constructed, and operated according to standard practice [18]. For the results\nto be presented below, the parameter values used were: \u0393 = 0.011; A = 0.020; and B =\n4\n0 or B = 2.00 for cases (a) or (b) respectively. The value of \u0393 was in fact too small to be\ndetermined directly from the circuit components (owing to the effect of stray capacitance\nand other non-idealities); instead, it was measured in a separate experiment. The model\nwas driven with quasi-white noise from an external noise-generator, and with a weak\nperiodic force from an HP3325 frequency synthesizer. The resultant fluctuating q(t) was\ndigitized in 1024 point blocks and ensemble-averaged by a Nicolet LAB80 data-processor\nto yield \u3008q(t)\u3009 . The advantage of averaging in the time (rather than the frequency)\ndomain is that it enables measurements to be made of the phase shift \u03c6 between the drive\nand the response [4, 6, 11] as well as yielding directly the amplitude a of the response.\nMeasurements were made of the stochastic amplification factor [19]\nS(T ) = a(T )\/a(0) (2)\nand of the corresponding value of \u03c6 over a wide range of T for the two cases (a) and (b).\nSome typical measurements of the noise-induced power gain are shown by the data\npoints in Fig 2 (where we plot S2, rather than S, for more convenient comparison with\nearlier SR results). It is immediately evident that, both for case (a) (squares) and for case\n(b) (circles), S2 at first increases rapidly with noise intensity, but then passes through\na maximum and decreases again, albeit more slowly. That these data should bear a\nstriking resemblance to those obtained previously for conventional SR [2-7] is, of course,\nno coincidence. We emphasize that, in the case of a linear system (harmonic oscillator),\nS2 would not increase at all but would remain equal to unity irrespective of the value\nof T . As anticipated, the maximum is much larger for case (b) than for case (a); it can\nbe shown [20] that, in case (b) for sufficently small \u0393, not only the signal but also the\nsignal\/noise ratio increases with increasing T within a certain range.\n5\nThe measured phase lag \u2212\u03c6 between the drive and response is plotted for case (a)\n(squares) and case (b) (circles) in Fig 3. The forms of \u2212\u03c6(T ) for the two cases are\nstrikingly different, but they can readily be understood qualitatively by analogy with a\nconventional (deterministic) resonance. In case (a) for T = 0, the periodic driving force is\nbeing applied at a frequency well beyond the natural frequency of the system, \u2126 > \u03c9(0)\n[see Fig 1(a)]. Consequently \u2212\u03c6 is close to 180\u25e6. As T is increased, however, the \u201cnatural\nfrequency\u201d \u03c9(E) is effectively being tuned past the fixed driving frequency. Near resonance\n\u2212\u03c6 passes through 90\u25e6 and, in the high T limit where the \u201cnatural frequency\u201d substantially\nexceeds \u2126, \u2212\u03c6 decreases towards 0\u25e6 exactly as would be seen in a conventional resonance.\nThe phase changes for case (b), while quite different, can be accounted for in a closely\nsimilar way. In this case, the \u201cnatural frequency\u201d \u03c9(E) always exceeds that of the drive\n\u2126 [Fig 1(b)], and so the phase lag \u2212\u03c6 is always less than 90\u25e6, although it approaches 90\u25e6\nnear the resonance maximum, just as expected.\nA quantitative theoretical description of these phenomena is readily constructed on\nthe basis of linear response theory (LRT), and is relatively straightforward given that the\nSDF of (1) for A = 0, Q0(\u03c9), is already known [16]. The susceptibility \u03c7(\u2126) of the system\ncan be found immediately from the fluctuation dissipation theorem [10]\nRe\u03c7(\u2126) =\n2\nT\nP\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nd\u03c91[\u03c9\n2\n1\/(\u03c9\n2\n1 \u2212 \u21262)]Q0(\u03c91) (3)\nIm\u03c7(\u2126) = (pi\u2126\/T )Q0(\u2126) (4)\nwhere P implies the Cauchy principal part. The squared amplitude of the response is\nthen just a2 = A2|\u03c7(\u2126)|2 so that\n6\nS2 = [a(T )\/a(0)]2 = |\u03c7(\u2126)|2\/{[\u03c9(0)2 \u2212 \u21262]2 + 4\u03932\u21262} (5)\nand\n\u03c6 = \u2212 tan\u22121[Im\u03c7(\u2126)\/Re\u03c7(\u2126)] (6)\nThe quantity Q0(\u03c9) in (3) and (4) - which, we emphasize again, is the SDF in the absence\nof the periodic force - was obtained from Eq (20) of Ref [16], also using its Eqs (4a),\n4(b), (14), (A7), (A9) and a numerical solution of its (16). Values of S2 and \u03c6 calculated\nin this way from (3)-(6) for (1) with the parameters used in the circuit and are plotted\n(full curves) as functions of T in Figs 2 and 3 for comparison with the experimental\nmeasurements. Given that there are no adjustable parameters, the agreement between\nexperiment and theory can be regarded as excellent.\nThe physical mechanisms of these stochastic amplification phenomena differ radically\nfrom that of conventional SR [9], and it might therefore be argued that the new effects\nreported in this Letter deserve to be given an entirely different name. We would disagree\nwith any such proposition, however, on two grounds: because, as we have shown, a unified\ntheoretical description of both sets of phenomena can be constructed in terms of LRT\nand the fluctuation dissipation theorem; and also because, ironically, the term stochastic\nresonance actually provides an apter description of the new phenomena than it does of\nconventional SR which, strictly, should not [21] be referred to as a resonance at all.\nIn conclusion we would emphasize, first, that the case (a) variant of SR discovered\nand investigated in the present work is in no way confined to the particular system (1).\nRather, it is a quite general phenomenon, to be anticipated in all underdamped nonlin-\near oscillators. In all situations where, as in case (b) the eigenfrequency has a smooth\n7\nextremum in its variation with energy (or has a higher singularity), a more pronounced\nmanifestation of SR is to be anticipated: it might reasonably be called zero-dispersion\nstochastic resonance (ZDSR). Secondly, there is an interesting distinction between the\npresent results and those of conventional SR. In the latter case, stochastic amplification\noccurs in both overdamped and underdamped systems but is at its most pronounced when\nthe damping is large; the new forms of SR studied above, on the other hand, are entirely\nrestricted to underdamped systems and are most pronounced when the damping is small.\nFinally, the differing dependences of the SR phase shift on noise intensity for cases (a)\nand (b) have helped to illuminate in a satisfying way the remarkably close analogy that\nexists between stochastic and deterministic resonance phenomena.\nThis work developed out of discussions with Mark Dykman, who first proposed that\nSR should be considered within the conceptual framework provided by LRT and the\nfluctuation dissipation theorem, with Riccardo Mannella who drew our attention to the\nsignificance of phase shifts in SR, and with Slava Soskin who predicted the existence of the\nzero dispersion spectral peaks.
