The opening paper from Carol Russell continues to\nbuild ALT-J\u2019s corpus of knowledge around institutional embedding of technology; this\ntime through an evaluation of the effectiveness of a staff development programme.\nThe following four papers all explore the challenge of learner engagement from a\nvariety of different angles: instructional design, student support and the pedagogy of\ninnovative, technology-mediated learning environments. As a relative newcomer to\nALT-J it seems to me that the distinctiveness of the journal lies in its ability to bring\ntogether such a broad range of work.\nWe start with Russell\u2019s evaluation of the impact of staff engagement in a fellow-\nship programme. Russell recognises first that technology adoption lies with the\nlecturer and second that lecturers do not act alone. Individual lecturers\u2019 decisions are\nimportant but they are taken within the context of a complex system and it is the co-\nordination of activities across their organisational context which is important. She\nfinds that engagement in the fellowship programme decreases individualised and\ndiscipline-specific uses of learning technology and increases shared, collaborative,\ncross-disciplinary uses that relate to institutional and departmental context. There are\nimportant lessons here for those of us involved in evaluating institutional change\nprogrammes.\nThe paper by Cebeci et al. is the first of three papers that look for relationships\nbetween learner engagement and success. They use a combination of accessing expert\nknowledge and statistical modelling to identify design features in online courses that\nare related to a high level of student achievement in final assessments. The analysis\nconfirms that it is particularly important for online courses to include examples and\nillustrations that promote engagement. In addition, this work offers practitioners and\ninstitutions a way of examining the quality of online courses before they go live.\nMalcolm Rutter examines the informal use of synchronous chat in computer labo-\nratories and looks for relationships between self-reported use of chat and assessment\nmarks. The tentative findings are that the use of chat may be helpful, as long as it is\nnot used excessively. We see that despite all our focus on design, illustrated in the\nCebeci et al. study, here we find that it is things outside the lecturers\u2019 control that may\nbe making the difference. Rutter\u2019s paper is a preliminary study, but considering the\nuptake of social networking tools by students, it would be interesting to see the nature\nof these relationships explored further.\nMaltby and Mackie take a different approach to measuring engagement. In their\nstudy they track learner engagement through the use of the institutional virtual learn-\ning environment (VLE). Drawing on the literature of student retention and student\nsupport, they argue convincingly that we need to engage learners in university study\nearly on, such as by involving them in a community of learners, making them feel part\n2  Editorial\nof something in order to prevent students at risk from withdrawing or failing. They\nlook for relationships between use of the VLE and academic performance for engaged\nand disengaged students. Unsurprisingly, they found that students with low technol-\nogy use were more likely to fail, but interestingly, that this pattern of behaviour is\nformed early on and difficult to change. There is a real role for technology here in\nhelping us to identify students in need of early intervention.\nFinally, Matthew D. Riddle examines learner engagement through online role\nplay. Starting with the constructivist notion that learners will be more fully engaged\nthrough practice in authentic learning environments, Riddle evaluates how students\nbecome engaged with online identities in a simulated professional environment. The\npaper focuses on how the online nature of the role play affects this engagement,\nincluding how students get into role and the influence of surveillance, and makes\nrecommendations for the design of authentic learning environments.\nTaken together, this group of papers illustrates the interdisciplinary nature of\ne-learning research. It is not just that ALT-J publishes work which arises from differ-\nent disciplinary traditions, it encourages the synthesis of new understandings from the\nbringing together of different bodies of knowledge and research methodologies. So\nwhat have we found out about creating engaging learning experiences? We know\nalready that cognitive engagement is necessary for learning and, whether in traditional\nor technology-mediated education, there are accepted ways to promote engagement,\nsuch as making it meaningful and making it interactive. These papers show that while\nwe can encourage cognitive engagement through good instructional design, we need\nto be increasingly aware of things that are going on outside the curriculum that influ-\nence engagement in learning and development.\nRhona Sharpe\nOxford Brookes University, Oxford, UK\n"}
