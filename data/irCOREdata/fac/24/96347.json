Many NOCs are politicized, bureaucratic, \nand hardly capable of even maintaining their current production levels. Some are just \nshells for employing foreign contractors or joint venture partners. An even smaller group \nof NOCs is technologically capable, well-managed, and run along economic criteria. By \nthe judgment of most people in the industry, Saudi Aramco, the largest oil company in \nthe world, is one of the latter.1\nAlthough Saudi Arabia is not a country most observers immediately associate \nwith lean and clean management, Aramco\u2019s role as the kingdom\u2019s greatest modern \ninstitution seems unassailable. Hardly a Saudi and practically no foreigner today is aware \nthat Aramco is what it is because of a number of historical decisions which could have \nbeen taken differently \u2013 and which many contemporaries expected to be taken differently, \nmuch to Aramco\u2019s detriment. Saudi Arabia was close to taking a course which many \nother oil exporters took, entrusting its upstream oil assets to an opaque, politicized local \ninstitution that was supposed to replace foreign-created Aramco. \nIn October 2005, a small note appeared in the local paper Arab News announcing \nthat the government-owned General Organization of Petroleum and Minerals, Petromin, \nwould be dissolved and its assets taken over by Aramco.2 No further explanation was \ngiven. Petromin at the time had long ceased to play an active role in Saudi economic \ndevelopment, its last visible presence being faded signs in the vicinity of some old petrol \nstations. But as incidental as it appeared, the little note indicated the closing of the last act \nin a long and twisted saga which was at the very core of Saudi state-building, a saga in \nwhich Petromin once was the lead actor, and Aramco its main antagonist. At stake was \nnothing less than which organisation would become Saudi Arabia\u2019s national oil company, \nand \u2013 more importantly \u2013 who would control it.  \nIt turned out to be a battle to death. The outcome was uncertain for many years, \nbut as readers will have guessed, Aramco eventually won. This paper tells the story why, \nrecounting it from forgotten Petromin\u2019s perspective,3 an organisation that was meant to \nbe national champion of industrialisation, a truly national oil company, and an \ninternational refining giant \u2013 great ambitions which were, one by one, thwarted. The fates \nof Aramco and Petromin differ from those of most other NOCs in a way that is very \ninstructive to comparative historians. \nThe paper is part of a larger project that analyses how conflicts and coalitions \namong a small number of princes and commoners shaped the modern Saudi state as we \nknow it today.4 The Petromin story is yet another reminder of how contingent the shape \nof the modern Saudi state is, and how many of its features are consequences \u2013 often \nunintended \u2013 of personal rivalries and ambitions at earlier historical junctures. \nAt the same time, this paper is a contribution to the comparative literature on \nNOCs, a long neglected field which has recently seen a number of significant \npublications.5 Saudi Arabia\u2019s peculiar situation of having had two parallel NOCs makes \nthe kingdom an especially interesting object of comparison. I take Aramco and Petromin \nas two radically different, but typical representatives of a larger universe of NOC cases. \nCombining my case research with the growing literature on other NOCs, I outline a \nclassification and a causal model of NOC development in large oil exporters of the \ndeveloping world. \n The paper will first introduce the main actors involved with Aramco and \nPetromin. It will then briefly recount the history of the latter\u2019s expanding ambitions and \nrole from 1962 to 1975, the age of King Faisal. I will then engage with the crucial \njuncture of 1975\/76 in more detail, analysing how and why Petromin was cut to size to \nthe benefit of a host of new actors sponsored by Crown Prince Fahd. The subsequent \nsection will describe Petromin\u2019s enduring ambitions and political entanglements, leading \nto its eventual fall from grace between 1983 and 1986. The remainder of the paper will \nadumbrate the tortuous mopping up operations undertaken in 1988-93 from which \nAramco emerged as the unchallenged national monopolist in oil production, refining and \ndistribution. I will conclude with comparative observations on NOC development. \n \nThe Actors \nLike the history of many other parts of the Saudi state, the story of Petromin is to a large \nextent the history of a few crucial members of the Saudi elite, both royals and \ncommoners. Ever since the creation of modern bureaucracy in Saudi Arabia, princes and \nthe commoners around them have been linked through patron-client relations: long-term, \ndeep and unequal links of fealty. Royals provide access to power, resources and status, \nwhereas the commoners provide loyalty and defend the interests of their patrons in state \nand society.  \nThese ties have been keeping elites with seemingly divergent interests \u2013 princes \nand technocrats \u2013 tightly knit together for more than half a century. In their diversity, \nthese links are reaching deep into the state apparatus. As sticky as they tend to be in \nSaudi Arabia, however, they are seldom simple \u201cdyads\u201d, but rather part of more complex \nnetworks of patronage in which clients themselves are patrons for actors further down in \nthe hierarchy, clients can have several patrons, and links can shift over time, changing \ntheir utility as the context changes.  \nAs we will see, the unmaking of a patron-client relationship can have dramatic \nconsequences. As I have argued elsewhere, the Saudi rentier regime was under few social \nand political constraints when deciding how to shape its rapidly expanding state between \nthe 1950s and 1980s. Shifting individual interests and coalitions in the elite therefore \nwere the main force determining how state institutions would grow and change.6 \nInstitutional change often reflected power shifts among a select few princes and \ntechnocrats. \nThe most senior among the select few in the Petromin saga is Faisal bin \nAbdulaziz, Saudi prime minister from 1962 and both king and prime minister from 1964 \non until his assassination in March 1975. No other king after him has centralized power \nas decisively in his own hands and wielded as much authority over the state apparatus. A \nconservative by nature, Faisal was careful not to rush economic development in the \nkingdom, in the process also putting a break on Petromin\u2019s expansion.7 Distrustful and \nsolitary, Faisal relied on a limited number of long-term advisors. One of them was long-\nterm oil minister (and ex officio chairman of the Petromin board) Ahmad Zaki Yamani,8 \nwhom Faisal groomed as lead technocrat after having read his sympathetic newspaper \ncommentary on administrative reform in the kingdom. \nYamani was born in 1930 as scion of a Mecca notable family, trained as a lawyer \nin Egypt and was one of the first Saudis to study in the US. In August 1958 Yamani \nbecame legal advisor to the Council of Ministers, then controlled by Faisal as prime \nminister. In July 1960, having gained Faisal\u2019s trust, he was promoted to Minister of State \nwithout portfolio. After Faisal had prevailed in his power struggle with King Saud, \nYamani became Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Affairs in March 1962 as successor \nof Abdullah Tariki, a vocal progressive who had fallen out of favour with Faisal.9\nIn contrast to Tariki, Yamani was a middle of the road player, described as suave \nand personable, with an \u2018aptitude for backing down gracefully when faced with \nopposition from his superiors\u201910. His smooth demeanour and media savvy would make \nhim the face of Saudi Arabia in the international arena. By all accounts, he had great \nrespect for his 28 year older royal patron Faisal whom he described as \u2018wily fox\u2019, albeit \nbeing privately critical of his reluctance to delegate authority.11 A rich man thanks to \nFaisal\u2019s paternal real estate gifts, Yamani managed to maintain an image of probity in \noffice for many years.12\nYamani as trusted Minister of Petroleum had large patronage resources of his \nown, grooming his own following on senior levels of the ministry. His most important \nclient there was arguably Abdulhadi Taher, born in 1930 in Medina to a family of limited \nmeans.13 His father died when Taher was a teen. Smart and ambitious, Taher nonetheless \nmanaged to obtain a B.A. in Commerce in Cairo while having to work to supplement the \nfamily income. In the mid-50s he was employed by the Directorate General of Petroleum \nand Mineral Affairs as assistant accountant, and soon started to move up its hierarchy.  \nThe Directorate was then headed by Abdullah Tariki, who was to become the first \nMinister of Petroleum in 1960, converting the agency into a full ministry. At the time, \nTaher worked on a PhD at Berkeley about \u2018Petroleum and Natural Gas Accounting and \nits Effects in Saudi Arabia\u201914. After Tariki was ousted, Yamani recognized Taher\u2019s \ntalents and appointed him governor of the newly-formed General Organization of \nPetroleum and Minerals. While ranked possibly the smartest figure among Yamani\u2019s \ntechnocrats, Taher was a more secretive and taciturn character than his boss.15 Yamani \nhowever consistently trusted him16 and delegated considerable responsibility to him.17\nYamani inherited another promising young technocrat from Tariki: Hisham \nNazer, from a leading Jeddah notable family that had been close to Faisal when he was \nvice-regent of the Western Province under his father King Abdulaziz.18 Nazer was born \nin 1932, attended the exclusive Victoria College in Alexandria, and went on to obtain a \nB.A. in international relations and an M.A. in political science at UCLA in 1957 and \n1958 respectively.19 He was subsequently reared as oil technocrat by Tariki, who made \nhim assistant director general of the Petroleum and Minerals Directorate in 1958 and sent \nhim to Venezuela in 1960 to learn about international oil matters.20  \nIn the early 60s, Nazer was reported to harbor progressive political attitudes, \nhaving expressed strong sympathies for Nasser. He managed to keep his head below the \nparapet when Tariki and other liberals were taken out, however. Some still suspected \nNazer of being sympathetic to Tariki, and at least for a while he seemed to hedge his bets \nby being not too close to the royals. He managed to quickly gain new minister Yamani\u2019s \ntrust, however, who decided to make him his deputy in 1962.21  \nNazer was described as an impressive figure, but with a tendency to be boorish \nand overbearing.22 Already under Tariki, young guns as Taher, Nazer and Mohammad \nJoukhdar (Nazer\u2019s successor as director general of the Ministry in 1962) competed for \npositions in the energy administration.23 There is no record of serious acrimony between \nthem however. As we will see, competition would become more antagonistic under a new \nroyal patron: \nIt was only when Fahd bin Abdulaziz, a half-brother and senior ally of Faisal,24 \nemerged as driver of economic policy in the early 1970s that rapid industrialisation \nbecame a government priority. Fahd, though not politically progressive, was a much \nmore avid modernizer than the king, opening vast new opportunities for Saudi \ntechnocrats. At the same time, in the aftermath of the 1973 oil shock and of \nnationalisations in other oil producing countries, national participation in the upstream oil \nindustry became a serious option in Saudi Arabia, creating new opportunities in the core \nof the Saudi oil sector.  \nFahd, reported to be alert, but a more insecure character than Faisal, had his own \nideas of how to organize the Saudi energy sector, however. He insisted to Faisal to be \nmade chairman of the Supreme Petroleum Council in 1973, telling Western friends at the \ntime that Yamani had too much power.25 As importantly, he would bring clients of his \nown into the growing state apparatus to administer industrialisation. But this is already \npart of the history which that will be recounted in more detail, and in chronological order, \nin the coming pages. \n \nCritical Junctures in Petromin\u2019s History: Yamani and Faisal \n1962 was the most important year in the history of the modern Saudi state: King Saud \nand his allies were marginalized and a coalition of senior princes under Faisal gained \ncontrol over the state apparatus. The most senior of them started to build their own \ninstitutional power bases; all of which have lasted until today, marginal shifts in \npersonnel notwithstanding. \nAmong commoners, Yamani was arguably the biggest winner of 1962, having \nbanked on Faisal as patron. Within Yamani\u2019s Ministry of Petroleum and Minerals \n(MOPM), Nazer was the biggest gainer, becoming his deputy at 29 years of age. He was \nnot the only one to move up the ranks, but others were far less happy with their \nadvancement. \nA royal decree of 22 November 1962 established Petromin,26 an organisation that \nwas apparently based on plans first adumbrated by Tariki.27 When Abdulhadi Taher was \nmade its governor, he was dejected: He complained to friends that Yamani had unfairly \nfavored Nazer, who was his junior.28 Taher would receive deputy ministerial rank, but \nonly after Nazer.29  \nSenior personnel of Aramco, the large US-owned oil concessionaire in the \nkingdom, consoled Taher: after all, the Petromin charter gave the new organisation an \nextensive mandate.30 It would be responsible for all exploration, refining, and distribution \nof all petroleum and mineral resources in the kingdom that were not in the domain of then \nUS-controlled oil concessionaire Aramco.31 In line with Tariki\u2019s nationalist vision, a \nfuture role as national oil company was explicitly envisaged.32  \nPetromin was supposed to become a governmental equivalent of Aramco \u2013 the \nimplicit idea being that it could one day take its place.33 These were the days of budding \nNOC ambition across the developing world: The Indonesian government had created \nnational oil distribution and exploration companies in 1957 and 1961 respectively (later \nto be merged into national oil giant Pertamina);34 Venezuela set up its Corporaci\u00f3n \nVenezolana de Petr\u00f3leos in 1962,35 and the Algerian regime created Sonatrach in 1963.36  \nDifferent from most other oil states, Petromin was not set up in an atmosphere of \nfeverish nationalism. Its inception rather came at a point of time when Faisal had \nclamped down on progressive Arab nationalists in the Saudi government, ushering in an \nera in which the conservative state dominated the anemic public politics of the \nkingdom.37 Yet, Petromin itself looked much like its peers in socialist-progressive oil \nexporters, following the statist development paradigm of the day: run as a state agency \nrather than an incorporated company, with a government-approved operating budget \nrather than its own capital basis.38  \nTaher, who remained on close terms with Yamani, warmed up to Petromin\u2019s \npromise. He was given considerable leeway by the minister and interpreted the \ninstitution\u2019s mandate very broadly.39 The organisation became the main vehicle of Saudi \nindustrialisation efforts for the coming decade. Its activities included minerals projects,40 \noil and gas exploration in areas relinquished by Aramco,41 and distribution of gas and \nrefined products within the kingdom.42 Petromin also started its own oil shipping \noperations.43\nEven more ambitiously, Taher initiated a raft of heavy industry ventures, \nrecognizing that the local merchants and contractors were in no shape to undertake \nindustrialisation of any significant scale by themselves. Petromin started petrochemical \nprojects,44 oil refineries in Saudi Arabia and abroad,45 glass46 and steel47 plants as well as \npower generation projects.48 Although projects usually involved foreign partners, the \nPetromin shares were 50 per cent or more.49 Needless to say, Aramco at the time was 100 \nper cent US-owned, and Tariki\u2019s talk of participation had been quashed by Faisal. \nAs Petromin was under the umbrella of the Faisal-Yamani partnership, it also got \nto take care of Faisal\u2019s most promising son, Saud Al-Faisal, who had returned from the \nUS with a Princeton B.Sc. in economics in the mid-60s. Yamani reportedly thought it \ngood idea to \u2018teach him business\u2019,50 and he joined Petromin as liaison officer to the \nMinistry in June 1966.51 In February 1970, having established an impeccable reputation \nas smart and humble,52 he became the institution\u2019s deputy governor. He moved on to \nbecome Yamani\u2019s deputy in June 1971. His brother Sa\u2019d Al-Faisal became his successor \nin Petromin, further underlining the close links of the Yamani system to the Al Faisal. \nWhatever Petromin\u2019s virtues in readying Faisal\u2019s progeny for higher office, in its \nindustrializing plans, it seemed to have bitten off more than it could chew. With national \ninfrastructure badly underdeveloped and an acute lack of qualified manpower, most of its \nprojects seemed to come too early in Saudi development to be viable.53 Moreover, Taher, \nPetromin\u2019s unquestioned supremo, seemed to pursue an idiosyncratic recruitment \npolicy.54 Many Petromin employees appeared underqualified.55  \nIt has been speculated that the governor, who was \u2018jealously guarding his own \npreserve\u2019,56 would not tolerate subordinates who were too smart. In any case, despite \nrapidly growing employment, Petromin\u2019s administrative structure remained ill-defined, \nwith Taher maximizing control over operations.57 The organisation\u2019s development \nreflected a general pattern of politicized or cronyist recruitment in the majority of \ndeveloping country NOCs which, depending on the system, tended to serve the political \nneeds of military elites, ruling family cronies, or powerful oil workers\u2019 unions (in the \nextreme case of Mexico\u2019s PEMEX leading to the sale of jobs by union bosses, known as \n\u201cvendeplazas\u201d).58\nWhile Petromin managed to build up modest domestic refining capacity, many \nother ventures tended to go nowhere, or worse, end in disputes. Numerous projects \ngreatly announced in the 1960s were never heard of again. Exploration results were \ndisappointing, and most minerals projects never took off. When Ed Awad, a chemical \nengineer Taher had poached from Occidental, started petrochemicals planning in the \nearly 1970s, he did so on a very basic level with practically no data. A petrochemicals \njoint venture with Philips (negotiated by Awad) went nowhere, as did petrochemicals \nnegotiations with Hercules.59 SAFCO, a fertilizer venture with Occidental, ended in \narbitration in the International Chamber of Commerce.60\nAt the same time, another player with a claim to planning national \nindustrialisation emerged: the Central Planning Organization. Although extant on paper \nsince 1964, the CPO had been dormant until King Faisal appointed Taher\u2019s former \ncolleague Hisham Nazer as its president in 1968.61 Aramco analysts soon detected a \npotential rivalry between the CPO and Petromin.62 As head of CPO, Nazer reportedly had \ndirect access to the king, and soon started working on the kingdom\u2019s first development \nplan, which had a considerable industrial component.63 Nazer also started rearing his own \nprot\u00e9g\u00e9s, sending senior CPO staff Faisal Bashir and Fayez Badr to the US to get their \nPhDs.64 At the same time, he successfully recruited Stanford Research International \nexperts to help him in assembling his plan.65 Yamani, although still on good terms with \nNazer, supposedly did not share all MOPM information with him.66\nThe CPO threat, if any, remained diffuse: as the organisation was responsible only \nfor indicative planning and inter-agency coordination, it did not dictate project specifics \nto Petromin. Yamani\u2019s status as arbiter of oil-related issues remained unchallenged, \nprotecting Petromin by association.  \nWith the 1973 oil boom, Petromin\u2019s ambitions only increased, as the kingdom\u2019s \nunprecedented riches left space for different institutions to grow rapidly in parallel.67 In \n1970, it already had more than 3000 employees in 1970;68 making it an unrivalled \nindustrial behemoth in a still deeply underdeveloped country. After 1973, refining and \npetrochemical plants in the billion dollar range were negotiated with Mitsubishi,69 \nShell,70, Dow and Mobil.71 Large steel mills were planned with BHP and Marcona,72 and \na gigantic gas gathering and liquefaction project was envisaged for the Eastern \nProvince.73 Plans for a trans-Arabian oil pipeline to a new industrial complex at the Red \nSea port of Yanbu were agreed with Mobil in 1974.74  \nPetromin also undertook the marketing of growing amounts of crude made \navailable by Aramco in the course of \u201cparticipation\u201d negotiations.75 The latter seemed to \nmove the organisation closer to an ambition it had developed after the regional climate \nhad become decidedly anti-Western in 1967: a direct stake in upstream operations, that is \nin Aramco\u2019s core turf \u2013 arguably Petromin\u2019s original raison d\u2019\u00eatre. Soon after the June \nwar, Yamani had announced that Petromin was seeking a stake in Aramco.76\nKing Faisal, the main restraining force on unbridled development spending, was \nsurprisingly killed by a nephew in March 1975. With him out of the picture, Saudi Arabia \nseemed to be headed for a development rush under zealous modernizer Fahd, who \nbecame Crown Prince and was given wide administrative leeway by new King Khaled. In \nJanuary 1975, the Petromin board had approved a 13 billion dollar development program \nfor the 1975-1980 period.77 Its detailed development plan for the period was cheekily \nannounced one week before the Council of Ministers ratified the CPO\u2019s five year plan in \nMay.78 Unsurprisingly, the numbers bandied about by Fahd, Yamani and Nazer were at \nvariance, as MOPM, Petromin and CPO operated with little coordination.79\nThe Petromin plan tackled every conceivable sector of industry: refining, \ngathering and liquefication of gas, mining, petrochemicals, fertilizers, iron, steel, \naluminium manufacture for local and export markets, as well as transport and distribution \nof various petroleum products. The flagship projects were three (potentially four) large \nexport refineries, and up to seven ethylene-based petrochemical plants, mostly on joint-\nventure basis.80\nIn practice, Petromin still had not got far by the mid-70s.81 Its international \nnegotiation partners pointed out that most of the large ventures would only be marginally \neconomic. Petromin seemed to have no conception of the magnitude of potential \nproblems and bottlenecks and relied on a faulty assumption of unlimited gas supplies.82 \nShipping refined products would be expensive \u2013 an issue Petromin planners never \nseemed to come to grips with \u2013 and Petromin lacked capital to build up distribution \nnetworks in consumer countries.83  \n \nTurn of the Tide in 1975 \nNone of this was worse than the teething problems of other national oil companies, which \nhave tended to be overambitious, politicized and lacking in administrative capacity. \nNonetheless, Petromin had to stomach its first big political defeat soon after the \nannouncement of its five year plan. Faisal\u2019s death would accelerate economic \ndevelopment, but it also led to a significant shift of political forces in the technocracy. \nIn October 1975 Fahd helped to engineer a massive cabinet reshuffle in which the \nnumber of ministries grew from 14 to 20 and numerous personnel were reshuffled. While \nYamani prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Saud Al-Faisal became Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nazer\u2019s CPO was \nupgraded to ministerial status. Yamani, himself for a while rumoured to become Minister \nof Foreign Affairs, stayed on as oil minister. \nMore importantly for Petromin, however, the new government contained a \nMinistry of Industry and Electrity (MOIE) which was patched together from various pre-\nexisting government entities. The MOIE claimed responsibilities previously held by \nTaher\u2019s sprawling Petromin empire. An official government information website \nexplains: \u2018There was the caution that Petromin, with all its potential, should not encroach \ninto fields already within the authority of other government bodies or ministries, but \nshould integrate its planning with theirs.\u201984  \nThe statement is remarkable for its relative frankness, but also for getting history \nthe wrong round. It is true that Petromin was a rather impenetrable fiefdom, but its \nmandate and large-scale industrialisation plans had predated the MOIE by more than a \ndecade. \nWhen the new portfolios were negotiated, Yamani lobbied for keeping the \nresponsibility for petrochemicals with Petromin.85 Fahd disagreed. Convinced that \nYamani and his clients had become too powerful, he was determined to realign the \nboundaries. He had chosen an aggressive young man, Ghazi al-Gosaibi, as Minister of \nIndustry and Electricity, who pushed for maximizing his purview.86\nThe Higher Committee of Administrative Reform was called upon to decide \nwhich sectors of industry would remain with Petromin. The Committee was presided by \nPrince Sultan, Fahd\u2019s full brother and ally. It decided that refining would stay with \nPetromin, whereas petrochemicals and mining would be assigned to the new ministry, \nwith all projects transferred accordingly. Petromin, the budding champion of national \nindustrialisation, was now effectively restricted to marketing, refining, and distribution of \noil.87 It had gone through a similar wing-clipping as Indonesia\u2019s Pertamina, which lost its \nnon-oil business in the second half of the 1970s after incurring spectacular losses.88\nGhazi al-Gosaibi later complained about Petromin\u2019s (read: Yamani\u2019s and Taher\u2019s) \nobstinacy, which was not ready to surrender anything to another ministry and was the \nmain obstacle in setting up the MOIE.89 The flipside of the story is that Gosaibi \nrepresented a new group of young clients Fahd had been nurturing and who represented a \nthreat to administrators fostered by Faisal. Abrasively expanding his turf in a system in \nwhich ministers generally are very careful not to encroach on each other\u2019s territory, it \ncomes as little surprise that Gosaibi never developed much of a rapport with Yamani.90\nLike several other new functionaries under Fahd, Gosaibi was from an old family \nof Najdi origin.91 Fahd had actively combed universities and sought ministers\u2019 advice to \nfind bright young administrators-to-be, rearing the next generation of technocratic \nclients92 which would be closer to him than either Yamani or Taher.93 Gosaibi was 8 \nyears younger than Taher, which considering the Saudi system\u2019s obsession with seniority \nprobably made for additional bad blood.94 He had been secretary of the Supreme \nPetroleum Council, a cabinet committee which had served as Fahd\u2019s control lever over \nthe energy sector and in which Taher was not represented.95  \nAdding insult to injury, Gosaibi made Ahmad Tuwaijri, previously a Petromin \nfunctionary (and also a Najdi) deputy minister in the MOIE.96 Soon piles of project \nproposals were transferred from Petromin to the Ministry, where they were assessed with \nthe help of the Industrial Studies and Development Center under the direction of its \ndeputy director general Abdulaziz Zamil, another descendant of a Najdi notable clan. All \nprojects as conceived by Petromin were eventually abandoned or renegotiated,97 as the \nnew team deemed them uneconomic or \u2018much too ambitious\u201998.  \nThe MOIE would move on to establish the Saudi Arabian Basic Industries \nCompany (SABIC) in 1976, with Gosaibi as chairman and Zamil as CEO. SABIC, \ncapitalized at 2.8 billion dollars, took over the operational responsibility for \npetrochemicals and other heavy industry projects.99 SABIC was set up with a rather lean \nmanagerial structure and incorporated as company; 30 per cent of it were subsequently \nsold off.100 Gosaibi and Zamil patently wanted to build up a counterexample to sluggish \nand statist Petromin. The latter gets a good drubbing in an official 2001 SABIC company \nhistory as ineffective and obstructionist, while all other actors involved in the creation of \nMOIE and SABIC (including Yamani) are lauded as cooperative101 \u2013 a very explicit \ncondemnation by Saudi standards, indicating the animosities that must have existed. \nThe newly created Royal Commission for the Industrial Cities in Jubail and \nYanbu provided SABIC with land and infrastructure.102 Fahd was chairman of the Royal \nCommission.103 His vice-chairman was none other than Hisham Nazer,104 who was \ninstrumental in setting it up the Commission,105 thus significantly expanding his role in \nmatters of industrialisation at Taher\u2019s expense.106 Neither Yamani nor Taher were \nmembers of the Commission.107\nNazer had once again astutely repositioned himself throughout a royal power \nshift, this time as a confidant of Fahd.108 He had developed close relations with \ngatekeepers around Fahd such as Adnan Khashoggi and Ghaith Pharaon,109 and soon \nbecame known as \u2018Hisham Abdul Fahd\u2019110 among his detractors. Nazer clearly had \ngrown out of being a client of Yamani, who himself had lost his main patron through \nFaisal\u2019s death. Yamani, who had once favoured Nazer over Taher when he appointed him \ndeputy, did not take ascendancy of the ebullient planning minister lightly. The dislike \ngrew so intense that the two could not be invited to the same parties anymore.111\nTaher\u2019s and Nazer\u2019s rivalry had also badly escalated by the mid-70s,112 as Nazer \nhad contributed to cutting Petromin to size. As Petromin remained with the MOPM, \nTaher remained close to Yamani. Perhaps to compensate for his losses, Taher became \nincreasingly active in private business, setting up the Aal Taher Group together with his \nbrother which would over the years engage in lubricants, chemical manufacturing and \nengineering.113\n \nOne can still interpret the rearrangement of portfolios in 1975\/76 as a mere step of \nadministrative differentiation. Seeing the scale of Fahd\u2019s modernizing ambitions, any one \norganisation would have been hard put to take charge of all industrializing activities. And \nit was only natural that Fahd would bring some of his own people into government.  \n \nTaher still had the hope that the regional trend towards nationalisation would make \nPetromin the default actor in the Saudi oil upstream, on which it now could arguably \nconcentrate. The Saudi government had started to buy stakes in Aramco from its US \nparent companies in 1972,114 and two years later Aramco appointed its first Saudi vice \npresident. Saudi control over upstream assets seemed in reach. \nIronically, however, the takeover negotiations seemed to be going a bit too well \nfrom Petromin\u2019s point of view. In lieu of aggressive nationalisation, the Saudi \ngovernment negotiated for consensual \u201cparticipation\u201d.115 By ceding company ownership \nrights, the Aramco parents could evade giving up managerial control over upstream \nassets. To create a Saudi interest in preserving Aramco\u2019s integrity, the company \nintroduced increasing numbers of Saudis into its management, training them for \nexecutive positions.116  Hoping to maintain their leading roles in what was one of the \nbest-run companies in the Middle East, these US-educated Saudis evolved to be the most \ncommitted anti-Petromin group in the kingdom.117 In all of OPEC, this group seems \ncomparable only to the PDVSA oil executives in Venezuela, nationals who had mostly \nworked in international oil company (IOC) operations before the national champion was \ncreated in 1977.118\nAramco insiders seemed to feel around 1976 or 1977 that Petromin was unlikely \nto become the supreme oil company in the kingdom.119 As the takeover of Aramco \nownership was handled relatively smoothly, the threat of building up Petromin as a full-\nblown national alternative was less and less required. The issue rather became how to \norganize the coexistence of Petromin and Aramco. \nPetromin still made the news regularly, and the scale of its projects continued to \ngrow.120 Mobil built the Petroline cross-Arabian pipeline for it in the late 1970s, using \nmore than 400.000 tons of pipe.121 Petromin spent hundreds of millions of dollars on its \ndomestic distribution facilities122 and expanded its lubricants joint ventures.123 Three \nlarge-scale export refinery joint ventures were initiated.124 In July 1978, the governor of \nPetromin was finally given ministerial status.125 Formally, Taher had caught up with \nNazer. The Petromin expansion happened in parallel with that of other developing \ncountry NOCs such as PEMEX, Sonatrach or Pertamina, which expanded to become \nlarge fiefdoms in the boom years, usually run by politically well-connected executives.126\nIn the late 1970s, Petromin\u2019s international oil sales business was sustained on a \nhigh level of between 1.5 and 2 million barrels per day. A flurry of sales deals were \nnegotiated with various states and international oil companies.127 As much of a success as \nthis was in terms of assuming an NOC role, it is in distribution that Petromin acquired a \nreputation for large-scale improbity. As the organisation was responsible for contract \ndetails, and setting exact prices, leeway for discretion and commission-taking was \nlarge.128 Yamani had previously convinced Faisal to kill \u2018princely oil\u2019129, but several \nroyals re-emerged as middlemen in Petromin deals.130 Official and actual sales volumes \nwere reported to be at variance.131  \nThe international oil sales business at the time was almost uniformly shot through \nwith middlemen and commission payments:132 Nigerian NNPC, Pertamina, Sonatrach \nand others, although operating in different political environments, all tended to \u201ccut in\u201d \npowerful players in their deals.133 Nonetheless, Petromin\u2019s intransparency, and Taher\u2019s \nown increasing wealth, gave ammunition to Petromin\u2019s critics. In 1979, Petromin gained \ninternational notoriety when it was reported that Italian state oil company ENI agreed to \npay a 115 million dollar commission for an oil supply contract. More than half the money \nwas to be paid to Italian politicians and the rest to Saudi officials, among them Petromin \nfunctionaries.134 As a government-to-government contract was at stake, the Saudi \ngovernment felt exposed.135 Similar deals involving other West European customers were \nrumoured or exposed briefly afterwards. An oil sales deal with West German Avia \ninvolved sales of 100.000 barrels\/day, and a variety of commissions: 17 cents per barrel \nfor Yamani (who could rely on Taher to flesh out the details), a slightly smaller cut for \nTaher, and a much larger one \u2013 possibly a dollar \u2013 for a senior prince.136\nAlthough Aramco had its own corruption scandal in 1977\/78 \u2013 on a gas gathering \nproject originally conceived by Petromin137 \u2013 this came to be seen as an exception, and \nwas dealt with by dumping chairman Frank Jungers. Aramco as organisation had been \nwidely insulated from local politics. Petromin\u2019s opacity and its de facto role as slush fund \nfor well-connected players appeared chronic by comparison. Taher\u2019s reputation suffered. \n \nDefeat in 1983 \nIt probably caused considerable anxiety among some Saudi Aramcons when Taher \nannounced in 1980 that Aramco would soon be taken over by a national company.138 By \nthat year, Aramco had four Saudis on its board: Yamani, Taher and two MOPM deputies. \nMore importantly, it had become 100 per cent Saudi-owned.139 However, \u2018no one quite \nknew what that meant\u2019,140 as the company remained incorporated in Delaware and the \nchairman an American.141 This gave Taher, opportunity for some blustering. In April \n1982, the Middle East Economic Digest reported that he was likely to be named head of a \nnational oil company which would be formed soon, despite considerable resistance in the \nSupreme Petroleum Council. His chances were rated high as he was the default candidate \nand a clear alternative plan for reorganizing the oil sector was lacking.142 Yamani \nreportedly backed Taher\u2019s candidacy.143\nAt the same time, trade journals expressed concern that a merger with Petromin \ncould affect the efficiency of Aramco. Petromin, as was delicately put, had \u2018developed \nalong more traditional Saudi lines\u2019144. By the early 80s, it had grown to a bureaucratic \nbehemoth, planning to employ a further 12.000 staff by 1985.145 Most of its operations \ndid not turn a profit, and the completion of its large refinery projects was delayed time \nand again. \nTaher\u2019s moment of near glory was rather brief. In August 1982, speculations were \nreported that Aramco would be allowed keep more autonomy146 \u2013 which probably had \nbeen the (unreported) default scenario since about 1977. Fahd was sitting out the difficult \ndecision of how to concretely organize Saudi control over Aramco, but he was unlikely to \nhave seriously considered giving the supreme job to Taher. \nIn November 1983, Ali Naimi was appointed president of Aramco, having \npreviously been executive vice president oil and gas affairs.147 Naimi was a quintessential \nAramco-reared oil functionary, having been an employee of the company since the tender \nage of 11, and having been sent to the US to study on an Aramco scholarship. While \nAmerican John Kelberer remained chairman and CEO, the Saudization of senior ranks \nwithin Aramco allowed the Saudi government to sustain its structure as enclave \ninstitution.148 Further questions of reorganisation were effectively postponed. Different \nfrom many other oil states, in politically quiescent Saudi Arabia there was no public \npressure towards nationalisation, making the cocooning of Western corporate structures \npolitically palatable. \nIt is likely that senior Aramco management would have created a political crisis if \nthe company had been forced to swallow the \u2018poison pill\u2019 of merging with Petromin, or \nof ceding any control over company strategy.149 Saudi Aramcons worked as a domestic \nlobby group similar to the \u201cAgropet\u201d association of Venezuelan oil managers that \nsuccessfully fought for a conservation of IOC managerial structures at the inception of \nPDVSA in 1977 (a victory that would prove less permanent than in the Saudi case).150\n \nAlthough the eventual shape of Aramco as national Saudi oil company remained unclear, \nby 1983 everyone with a more than fleeting interest in Saudi oil recognized that Petromin \nwas, once again, out of the game.  \n  \nHaving benefited from ever growing development budgets during the oil boom decade, \nPetromin remained a vast organisation. Although Aramco also operated a large refinery \nat Ras Tanura, Petromin still was supposed to be the main Saudi refiner and marketer. \nThree huge export refineries with a total capacity of 1.3 million barrels\/day were being \nbuilt with Mobil, Shell and Greek Petrola.151 Due to a restrictive petroleum pricing \npolicy, Petromin also had to step in as the main operator of Saudi gas stations (opening \nanother avenue for Taher\u2019s own business interests).152  \nThe oil crunch after 1982 by default increased Petromin\u2019s share in the \ninternational marketing of Saudi oil. Public diplomat Yamani and his technician Taher \nremained personally involved. During the lengthy OPEC meetings of the early 80s, \nYamani reportedly concluded oil sales deals with advance knowledge of newly agreed \nprices, operating through a company registered in Gibraltar called \u201cEvergreen\u201d. Together \nwith a second-generation royal, Yamani and Taher were major stakeholders in the Saudi-\nEuropean Bank in Paris, which was used mainly for recycling oil rents.153 Taher, who \nthrough his managerial position was more involved in the nitty-gritty of rent-seeking than \nYamani, was also known for hiring barges to transport unaccounted oil to tankers waiting \noffshore (a practice still widespread in Nigeria).154  \nMuch of this might have been tolerated as royals were often involved to gain \npolitical cover \u2013 or would even initiate oil sales deals as in the case of the oil for planes \nswap in 1984, when Petromin was ordered to sell 34 million barrels of oil to pay for 10 \nBoeing 747s.155\nBut there were other areas in which the smaller size of oil exports and income \nmade itself felt more painfully: with declining oil revenues, Petromin faced problems in \nits expensive refining ventures, where enduring problems of waste and politicized \nplanning became glaringly obvious. Petromin\u2019s refinery project with Petrola at the Red \nSea port of Rabigh in particular became an \u2018extremely expensive mess\u2019156 and an emblem \nof everything that can go wrong in state-led industrialisation. \nThe main player on the Greek side was Petrola owner John S. Latsis, who had a \nhistory of business with Taher157 and was reported to enjoy privileged access to him.158 \nShipping magnate Latsis also made sure to woo Fahd, who became king in June 1982, by \ndesigning large private yachts for him. Rabigh would become Fahd\u2019s \u2018pet project\u2019159. \nAmong industry insider, Rabigh was generally considered a \u2018lousy deal\u2019, with Latsis \novercharging for a technologically unsophisticated plant.160 The refinery suffered from \nendless construction delays and cost overruns and would not start production until \n1990.161 Against the background of oil crash-induced austerity in the mid-1980s, it killed \nPetromin\u2019s credibility as refining company. The output of refined products had only \nincreased from 226,000 to 349,000 barrels per day between 1970 and 1984, a negligible \nincrease compared to the resources poured into Petromin.162\nThe collapse of the oil price in 1985\/86 also killed something else for good: Zaki \nYamani\u2019s career. Fahd, long trying to circumscribe the oil minister\u2019s influence, took \nSaudi Arabia\u2019s failure to maintain OPEC discipline as reason to relieve him of his duties \non 29 October 1986. Yamani learned of his dismissal on TV. \n \nCleaning Up: 1986-93 \nFahd\u2019s loyal client Hisham Nazer had been rumoured as Yamani\u2019s successor as early as \n1983.163 In 1986 his turn had come. Abdulhadi Taher\u2019s long-time patron was replaced by \none of his worst rivals. Nazer had become Taher\u2019s boss. \nNazer initially was appointed on an interim basis, which led some observers to \nspeculate that Taher might actually be in the ascendancy.164 In December however, in the \nmiddle of an OPEC meeting, Taher was sacked. Nazer got his permanent appointment \nbriefly afterwards.165 In April 1987, both Yamani and Taher were removed from the \nAramco board.166 Taher was succeeded by his deputy Jamal Jawa, who himself resigned \na few months later. \nAfter oil price had somewhat stabilized, Nazer tackled the tortuous reorganisation \nof the oil sector which would finally lead to the death of Petromin. The meandering path \nthe remake took is testament to the stickiness of institutions in Saudi Arabia, even those \nwhich have outlived their political purpose.  \nIn November 1988, a royal decree finally created \u201cSaudi Aramco\u201d, which was to \nown and operate the former Aramco assets.167 Nazer became its first Saudi chairman.168 \nThe king also set up a Supreme Council for the company, chaired by himself, which \nwould approve the Saudi Aramco\u2019s 5-year plans and annual reports as well as appoint the \ncompany\u2019s president at the recommendation of its board of directors.169  \nNext to senior Saudis, the board still contained former US oil executives and \nbankers, in effect preserving most of Aramco\u2019s existing setup \u2013 a unique structure among \nlarge non-Western NOCs.170 Headed mostly by Saudis who had been reared into \nAmerican-style management, Saudi Aramco retained extensive operational autonomy. \nAny deeper bureaucratic intervention, the bugbear of Aramco\u2019s Saudi management, was \naverted.171 Aramco structures had been definitely cocooned under the king\u2019s and Nazer\u2019s \nsupervision. The process is most comparable to the smooth phasing in of PDVSA in \nVenezuela through \u2018service agreements\u2019 with the old IOCs, which allowed their main \nupstream ventures to be preserved within PDVSA. Aramcons tend to say that their \ncompany was \u2018purchased commercially\u2019, not \u2018nationalized\u2019.172\n1988 also saw the formation of Petrolube and Luberef under the MOPM, which \nconsolidated Petromin\u2019s diverse lubricants businesses. Briefly afterwards, the Saudi \nArabian Marketing and Refining Company, Samarec, was created as a shell for \nreorganizing Petromin\u2019s \u2018Byzantine\u2019173 refining operations (previous attempts to engineer \na privatisation of Petromin had faltered, as the company proved impossible to value \ncommercially174).175 Petromin continued to formally exist as SAMAREC\u2019s holding \ncompany.  \nPetromin had become a practically headless entity headed by an interim governor. \nNonetheless, its sprawling apparatus was not easily reorganized, and Nazer \u2013 its ex \nofficio chairman \u2013 was unable to position his people as swiftly as he wished. The \nrestructuring was hampered by a shortage of skilled manpower, mid-level resistance and \nthe sheer size of Petromin\u2019s badly inefficient operations.176 Samarec and Petrolube \nproved to be only intermediate steps of restructuring, a kind of temporary scaffolding for \nthe eventual dismantlement of the Petromin legacy. \nWhile Samarec lasted, however, Nazer seems to have used it to build his own \nempire. A Hijazi client of his, Hussain Linjawi, was put in charge of the new body and \nstarted spending large amounts on salaries, offices and office services (in one deal alone, \nSamarec reportedly rented 600 Lexuses).177 As Samarec was incorporated as company, it \nactually had even more independence in hiring and spending than Petromin.178 A bloated \napparatus itself, it failed to streamline Petromin assets or turn a profit. A \u2018cold war\u2019 \nbetween Samarec and Aramco set in, as Aramco was opposed to a politicized \ndownstream entity that would provide negative returns on its oil.179 Samarec lingered. \nThe 1990\/91 Gulf war accelerated developments. Saudi Arabia\u2019s contribution to \nthe allied war effort consisted to a significant degree of jet fuel provided to the US for \nfree, produced by Samarec refineries.180 In the meantime, domestic fuel was sold for \nhardly more than production costs, preventing Samarec from turning a profit.  \nNazer begged the king to raise fuel prices so that Samarec could become viable. \nAfter the war, however, cautious Fahd encountered organized political opposition for the \nfirst time in his tenure. He was in no mood to squeeze Saudi consumers. In a traditional \ngesture of paternal largesse, he instead lowered domestic gasoline and utility prices in \n1992. \nSamarec was effectively bankrupt, owing Aramco large amounts of money for the \ncrude the latter had supplied to its refineries.181 It could not even cover its operating \ncosts. As a consequence, in June 1993, Fahd decreed that the Samarec mongrel \u2013 which \nhad never been formally incorporated \u2013 be dissolved and its assets taken over by \nAramco.182 This elegantly solved the debt problem183 and made Aramco what Petromin \nwas originally meant to become: the sole actor in the Saudi oil sector.  \nAs per Fahd\u2019s decree, Saudi Aramco's absorption of Samarec was to be complete \nbefore mid-1994. Until then Samarec's 12,000 staff members would either receive \nstandard Aramco employment contracts, after passing tests, or be discharged.184 Aramco \nwas given a mandate to clean up. \nHow much the company had been allowed to take over the oil sector\u2019s \nmanagement became obvious in 1995: Rather unexpectedly, the ostentatious Nazer \nhimself was replaced as minister by Ali Naimi, the quintessential Aramco technocrat. One \nof the reasons apparently was the involvement of Nazer\u2019s son in a refining project with \nMobil in 1993 that never got off the ground.185\nNaimi continued the mopping up operations: In 1996, Saudi Aramco took full \ncontrol of Luberef and Petrolube. Petromin\u2019s remaining mining assets were converted \ninto the national mining company Maaden in 1997, with Naimi as chairman. Only after \nKing Fahd\u2019s death, however, was Petromin as legal entity formally dissolved. \n \nConclusion: Histories of the Saudi State \nThe Petromin story illustrates what old Saudi hands know, but many political scientists \ntheorizing about \u2018rentier states\u2019 and the \u2018resource curse\u2019 seem unable to recognize: \nDifferent parts of an oil state can function very differently. The expansion of the Saudi oil \nstate in the 1970 allowed for the parallel growth of a very diverse array of institutions: the \nAmericanized Saudi management in Aramco, the progressively ossified bureaucracy of \nPetromin, as well as the lean, but local management of SABIC. How these different \ninstitutions evolved, and which ones emerged on top, was not predetermined. Absent \npowerful political forces outside of the regime core, it rather was contingent on the quirks \nof a small section in the Saudi elite \u2013 their personalities, their patronage relations and \ntheir more or less petty conflicts.  \nRelatively minor decisions could have great consequences further down the road. \nNowhere is this clearer than in Fahd\u2019s impact on the Saudi state qua his build-up of a \ntechnocratic clientele. Faisal-Fahd comparisons are popular in Saudi Arabia and tend to \nwork out in favor of the great patriarch Faisal. Fahd is seen as a less imposing ruler who \ntended to dither in crises and was more lenient on corruption. What often goes \nunrecognized is the institutional legacy he left through his knack for co-opting bright \nyoung administrators and protecting islands of efficiency in the state. \nWhatever the political motivations involved, it was clients of Fahd who built \nSABIC, which nowadays is a large and highly profitable player on the international \npetrochemical markets. It managed to turn Petromin\u2019s loss-making and scandal-ridden \nSAFCO into a profit-making enterprise186 and has emerged as the most impressive \nindustrial concern in the Middle East. Similarly, the Royal Commission for Jubail and \nYanbu is nowadays widely seen as a success story, having enabled swift and large-scale \nindustrialisation, and avoiding the sluggishness of the Saudi bureaucracy at large.187 It \nstands in marked contrast to the politicized heavy industries in places as diverse as \nAlgeria, Kuwait and Mexico.  \nFinally, Saudi Aramco remains a unique institution thanks to Fahd\u2019s decisions to \neffectively shield it from the rest of the Saudi state. It still is by far the most important \ncareer vehicle for bright and ambitious young Saudis, its meritocracy unmatched by any \nother organisation in the kingdom. For what it is worth, Aramco also remains an enclave \nof American corporate culture, allowing women to drive in its compounds, and both \ngenders to mix at the workplace.  \nAramco has been more consistently insulated from political pressures than any \nother OPEC NOC \u2013 including PDVSA, which went through a similarly smooth transition \nto national ownership, but was fiscally undermined by the Andres Perez government in \nthe early 1980s and has recently been stripped of its managerial autonomy by Hugo \nChavez.188 Different from many other OPEC NOCs, Aramco has kept control over its \noperating revenue.189 The company remains accountable most of all to the king, whose \nrole as guarantor of the company\u2019s autonomy seems peerless in OPEC (only akin perhaps \nto that of the Malaysian Prime Minister vis-\u00e0-vis national oil champion Petronas190).  \nAlthough commoners below him fought out important details, Fahd also took the \nultimate decisions in 1975-6, 1982-3 and 1988 which slice by slice consigned Petromin to \nhistory; a great project of autonomous national development which turned out to be \ndeeply flawed. If Petromin had been allowed to take over the oil sector, Saudi Arabia \nwould look very different today. This is not a merely academic point: While the Saudi \nregime abandoned Petromin, its other NOC peers by and large have lingered until today, \ncontrolling much of their countries\u2019 upstream sectors.  \n \nPatterns of NOC history in major developing world oil producers  \n \n High conflict \nnationalisation \nLow conflict nationalisation \n \nOutcome \nPolitically \nInsulated \n-- Aramco (Saudi Arabia) \nADNOC (Abu Dhabi) \nPDVSA (Venezuela) at times \nHigh efficiency \nPoliticized KPC (Kuwait), \nNIOC (Iran), \nPEMEX (Mexico), \nSonatrach (Algeria) \nPetromin (Saudi Arabia) \nPDVSA (Venezuela) at times \nPertamina (Indonesia)  \nNNPC (Nigeria) \n \nLow efficiency \n \nIn addition to sources already cited, this table draws on: Brumberg and Ahram, NIOC; Heard, \n\u201cDevelopment of Oil\u201d; Khan, Nigeria; Brown and Knight, eds., Mexican Petroleum Industry; Tetreault, \nKuwait Petroleum Corporation; Mommer, Governance of Venezuelan Oil. \n \nWhere are Aramco and Petromin located in the larger universe of NOCs? The table above \nclassifies NOCs of major developing country oil exporters on which sufficient \ninformation is available. Based on the case history of the two Saudi NOCs, combined \nwith the literature on other cases, I argue that two major questions determine the shape of \nthe nationalisation process and of the resulting NOC: First, is the relationship with \nincumbent IOCs antagonistic \u2013 usually driven by resource nationalism and populist \nideologies \u2013, or do IOCs and governments cooperate in the transfer of upstream assets? \nSecondly, is the NOC that takes over politically insulated or shot through with social and \npolitical interests?  \nAs the empty upper left corner shows, a conflict-ridden nationalisation seems to \nprevent the emergence of an insulated NOC organisation: Resource nationalism \npoliticizes the upstream sector \u2013 moving cases to the lower left corner so to speak \u2013 and \ntends to give stakes in the new entity to unions (PEMEX, Sonatrach) or populist political \ngroups (KPC, NIOC). This reinforces the above point that the preservation of Aramco\u2019s \nAmerican managerial structures would not have been thinkable in a nationalistic political \nenvironment.  \nConversely, however, low nationalism does not guarantee insulation: Petromin \nwas created by a conservative, authoritarian state that suppressed populist and nationalist \nideologies very effectively; resource nationalism was muted. Similarly, Venezuela, \nIndonesia and Nigeria avoided an all-out clash with IOCs. In all these cases, however, \nNOCs have been politicized (intermittently in the case of Venezuela, consistently in the \nother cases).  \nThe two bottom corners contain very different entities. Being \u201cpoliticized\u201d for our \npurposes indeed can mean very different things: elite cronyism, fiscal exploitation, \npolitical capture by unions, all-out corruption, populist attacks by the regime etc. But the \nbottom line is that the company is shot through by social interests. As a result, efficiency \ntends to suffer. \nIt is only in cases in which nationalisation was a cooperative process and the new \nNOC has been politically insulated that reasonable degrees of efficiency have been \nreached. Aramco is the ideal type case. PDVSA in its early years comes pretty close, as \ndoes Abu Dhabi\u2019s ADNOC (which however is a shell company for joint ventures with \nIOCs rather than an operationally autonomous organisation191). PDVSA and Aramco are \ngenerally rated among the most efficient NOCs, considerably above their OPEC peers.192 \nThanks to its inherited capacities, the reluctantly nationalized Aramco nowadays \nironically is the one NOC that does not have to denationalize by letting IOCs back into \nthe upstream. Alone among NOCs, it is capable of managing upstream capacity \nexpansion by itself. \nSaudi Arabia could not have built up an Aramco-like organisation from scratch \u2013 \nwhen it tried to build local structures through Petromin, it failed. The low level of \nresource nationalism however allowed it to preserve the foreign assets in the \nnationalisation process. As the cases in the bottom right corner show, this was not an \nautomatic outcome: Political interventions in NOC budgets, prices, investment, \nappointments etc. are common also in cases in which nationalisation was not \naccompanied by anti-IOC populism. Nationalism is not the only cause of politicisation. In \nmany cases, the rent-seeking interests of small elites undermined institution-building, be \nit shifting coalitions of military rulers and senior bureaucrats in Nigeria, or the long-\nlasting alliance of Suharto and Pertamina\u2019s Dr. Ibnu Sutowo in Indonesia.193  \nThe crucial role of elite decisions in the very different Saudi story is all the more \nstriking, in particular Fahd\u2019s moves on Aramco and Petromin. There was nothing that \ndetermined the preservation of the former and the demise of the latter other than the \nvagaries of a few princes and technocrats, in a variable mix of jealousy and \nadministrative acumen. \n \n \n \n \n \nReferences \nAissaoui, Ali.Algeria: The Political Economy of Oil and Gas, Oxford University \nPress\/Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, 2001. \n \nBaena, Cesar E.
