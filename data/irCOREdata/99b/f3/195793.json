Doi: 10.1007\/s10712-007-9017-8Metadata only entryThe Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) has been operating as an international co-operative organization for over 10 years. The network has now grown so that the fields of view of its 18 radars cover the majority of the northern and southern hemisphere polar ionospheres. SuperDARN has been successful in addressing a wide range of scientific questions concerning processes in the magnetosphere, ionosphere, thermosphere, and mesosphere, as well as general plasma physics questions. We commence this paper with a historical introduction to SuperDARN. Following this, we review the science performed by SuperDARN over the last 10 years covering the areas of ionospheric convection, field-aligned currents, magnetic reconnection, substorms, MHD waves, the neutral atmosphere, and E-region ionospheric irregularities. In addition, we provide an up-to-date description of the current network, as well as the analysis techniques available for use with the data from the radars. We conclude the paper with a discussion of the future of SuperDARN, its expansion, and new science opportunities","downloadUrl":"","fullTextIdentifier":null,"pdfHashValue":null,"publisher":"Springer Verlag","rawRecordXml":"<record><header><identifier>\n        \n            \n                oai:lra.le.ac.uk:2381\/7907<\/identifier><datestamp>\n                2012-07-24T15:53:21Z<\/datestamp><setSpec>\n                com_2381_1<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                com_2381_9549<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                col_2381_10633<\/setSpec>\n            <\/header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/\" xmlns:dc=\"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/\" xmlns:doc=\"http:\/\/www.lyncode.com\/xoai\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/ http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc.xsd\" ><dc:title>\n            \nA decade of the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN): scientific achievements, new techniques and future directions<\/dc:title><dc:creator>\nChisham, G.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nLester, M.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nMilan, Steve E.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nFreeman, M.P.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nBristow, W.A.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nGrocott, Adrian<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nMcWilliams, K.A.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nRuohoniemi, J.M.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nYeoman, Tim K.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nDyson, P.L.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nGreenwald, R.A.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nKikuchi, T.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nPinnock, M.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nRash, J.P.S.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nSato, N.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nSofko, G.J.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nVillain, J.-P.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nWalker, A.D.M.<\/dc:creator><dc:description>\nThis paper was published as Surveys in Geophysics, 2007, 28 (1), pp. 33-109.
