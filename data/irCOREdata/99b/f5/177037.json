In many western nations it is advocated by state \nhealth departments and leading organisations of health professionals. In the context of \ndecisions about professionally-controlled interventions such as prescription medicines \nand surgery, attention has generally focused on the information that is given to patients \nabout relevant options, and on ensuring that decisions reflect patients\u2019 free, informed, \ndeliberated preferences (Kukla, 2005). This reflects the choice-centred notion of \nprofessional respect for patient autonomy that currently dominates bioethics (see \nBeauchamp & Childress, 2001).   \nAlthough efforts to promote patient involvement are not new, research continues \nto suggest that patients are not routinely enabled to make free, informed and deliberated \ntreatment choices. Studies of consultations identify deficiencies in the extent to which \nhealth professionals tell patients about healthcare options and elicit their views about \nthese (Elwyn, Hutchings, Edwards, Rapport, Wensing, Cheung et al, 2005; van den \nBrink-Muinen, van Dulmen, de Haes, Visser, Schellevis & Bensing, 2006); studies of \npatients\u2019 perspectives on decision-making find that many think that their doctors rather \nthan they made key decisions about their treatment (Ford, Schofield & Hope, 2003; \nEntwistle, Watt, Gilhooly, Bugge, Haites & Walker, 2004); and studies of patients\u2019 \nunderstandings of and attitudes towards particular interventions suggest that significant \nnumbers have made some poorly-informed choices about their healthcare (Marteau, \nDormandy & Michie, 2001; Fagerlin, Lakhani, Lantz, Janz, Morrow, Schwartz et al, \n2006).   \nHowever, there is scope to debate why and to what extent these findings reflect \nproblems with healthcare quality. Patients do not always expect or want to be given \n 3\ninformation about a menu of treatment options and responsibility for making a choice \nbetween these (Say, Murtagh & Thomson, 2006). The reasons for this are still poorly \nunderstood, and the implications for evaluations of patient-practitioner communication \nand decision-making are contested (Entwistle, 2006).  \nPatients who report preferences not to make or take responsibility for treatment \ndecisions might still say they want to be involved in decision-making. A few qualitative \ninvestigations suggest that people might consider themselves to have been involved \u2013 \nand value feeling included - even though they have not been informed about and \nconsidered all the options and have not significantly influenced the selection of a course \nof action (Henman, Butow, Brown, Boyle & Tattersall, 2002; Beaver, Jones, \nSusnerwala, Craven, Tomlinson, Witham et al, 2005; Entwistle, Williams, Skea, \nMacLennan & Bhattacharya, 2006). Investigations of patients\u2019 responses to structured \nquestions about their involvement have found that people may take a broader range of \nissues into account than those emphasised in models that focus on information exchange \nand patient influence (Entwistle, Skea & O\u2019Donnell, 2001; Davey, Lim, Butow, Barratt \n& Redman, 2004; Entwistle et al, 2004).  \n In England, the National Patient Survey that is used to monitor the quality of \nhealthcare provision from patients\u2019 perspectives assesses involvement in treatment \ndecision-making with a question that invites patients to evaluate their involvement \nrelative to their own preferences. Referring to a recent healthcare encounter or episode, \nit asks them \u201cWere you involved as much as you wanted to be in decisions about your \ncare and treatment?\u201d and offers the response options \u201cYes, definitely\u201d, \u201cYes, to some \nextent\u201d, or \u201cNo\u201d (Health Care Commission, 2005). (These response options have varied \nslightly across surveys.) In 2004 and 2005 around 31% of primary care patients and \n46% of inpatients indicated that they were not involved as much as they wanted to be \n 4\n(Health Care Commission, 2006). However, the question does not impose any particular \ndefinition of involvement on respondents, and the forms and degrees of involvement \nthat patients regard as desirable are poorly understood.    \nWe undertook a qualitative study to explore what it means to people with \ndiabetes to be involved in decisions about their treatment in the contexts of both \noutpatient and inpatient care. We hoped to generate information that could inform both \npractical efforts to improve patients\u2019 experiences of involvement and developments in \nthe conceptualisation of involvement.  \nThe rationale for focusing on people with diabetes was that they are usually \nencouraged to develop an understanding of their condition and to engage actively in its \nmanagement, so they should be well placed to participate in treatment decisions \n(Funnell, 2004). Also, they have experience of interacting with a variety of health \nprofessionals and of considering and revisiting a number of decisions relating to the \nmanagement of their condition, so should be able to reflect on situations in which they \nhave been more and less involved. \n \nMethods  \nThe study was approved by Grampian Research Ethics Committee (reference \n05\/S0802\/36).  \nRecruitment and consent \nAdults with diabetes were recruited from four multi-practitioner outpatient \ndiabetes clinic sessions in May-August 2005. Posters advertising the study were placed \nin the waiting room. MP was present in the waiting room to provide information sheets \nand explain the study. In the last two clinic sessions, she approached people from the \ngender\/age groups previously under-represented in the sample to offer information \n 5\n MP took contact details for volunteers and telephoned them at least 24 \nhours later to arrange interviews if they were still willing. A signature indicating \nconsent was obtained prior to the interview.  \nData collection \nMP conducted semi-structured interviews in participants\u2019 homes within a week \nof their outpatient visit. She asked participants first to describe the history of their \ndiabetes and the healthcare they had received to date and then to describe their recent \nconsultation(s) at the diabetes clinic, to identify any treatment decisions that were \nconsidered, and to comment on how this consultation compared with others they had \nexperienced. She asked participants to answer the question about involvement in \ndecisions from the National Patient Survey with reference to their recent consultation, \nand then to explain why they chose the response option that they did. People who had \ndescribed contrasting experiences of healthcare in their initial accounts were asked \nwhether and why they would have answered the question differently in relation to these. \nPeople who had been hospitalised in the last two years were also asked to describe their \nmost recent hospitalisation and answer the National Patient Survey question with \nreference to that. Finally, all participants were invited to discuss what kinds of things \nmade them feel involved or uninvolved in decisions about their treatment, and what \ninvolvement meant to them.  \nData analysis \nInterviews were audiorecorded and transcribed. All authors read a sample of \ntranscripts and discussed provisional themes. MP and then VE worked systematically \nthrough all transcripts and created charts to summarise: issues that the researchers \nidentified as relating to involvement in participants\u2019 descriptions of their healthcare \nexperiences; responses to the National Patient Survey and explanations given for these; \n 6\nand participants\u2019 statements about what made them feel involved (or not) and what \ninvolvement meant to them.  \nThe issues that participants associated with involvement were identified from \ntheir explanations for their responses to the National Patient Survey question and from \nstatements explicitly about involvement. These issues were grouped into themes that \ncould have practical relevance for health professionals. The themes were discussed \namong the authors, refined and checked against the charts to ensure all relevant issues \nwere accommodated.  \n \nFindings \nSample characteristics \nTwenty-one people volunteered contact details at the clinic and eighteen were \ninterviewed. All participants were white British. They included ten men and eight \nwomen from across the 20 to 79 year age range. Seven had Type 1 diabetes and eleven \nhad Type 2 diabetes. They were between one and 31 years since diagnosis and followed \na range of management regimes (Table 1).  \nParticipants\u2019 accounts of their diabetes care to date were diverse. Most drew \nsome contrasts between their experiences with different practitioners and clinical \nsettings, particularly in relation to communication and perceived quality of care.  \nIssues associated with involvement in decision-making  \nSome participants answered direct questions about what it meant to them to be \ninvolved in treatment decisions without hesitation and using generalised conceptual \nstatements. Others were more hesitant and some responses took the form of stories \nabout particular healthcare incidents or descriptions of typical healthcare encounters. \nWhen asked whether they had thought much about their involvement in treatment \n 7\ndecisions before the interview, most participants indicated that they had not, although \nseveral reported having reflected on involvement when they had perceived a lack of it as \nproblematic. However, all participants seemed to have an understanding of involvement \nthat they could apply in relation to decisions about their treatment and use to answer and \ndiscuss their responses to the National Patient Survey question.  \nMost of what participants said about their involvement in decisions focused on \ndecisions about interventions for which health professionals are gatekeepers (e.g. \nprescription medications) and on communication between patients and health \nprofessionals (about health problems, health-related behaviours and healthcare \ninterventions). Some participants also mentioned their involvement on a daily basis with \ndecisions about diet, exercise, lifestyle and medication use. This latter is an important \nissue, but was not the focus of this study.    \nWe grouped the issues that patients associated with involvement into three broad \nthemes that should have practical relevance for clinicians. Each theme has several \nrelated sub-themes:   \n1. The ethos and feel of healthcare encounters  \nWhen describing their healthcare to date, all participants made some reference to \npractitioners\u2019 orientation or manner towards them and to how practitioners\u2019 actions and \nfeatures of healthcare settings made them feel. Participants associated several inter-\nrelated, positively valued, features of the \u2018feel\u2019 of healthcare encounters - and the \nprofessional behaviours that contributed to these - with \u2018involvement\u2019:  \na) Friendly and welcoming \nInvolvement was associated with practitioners being \u2018friendly\u2019 and \n\u2018approachable\u2019 and patients feeling \u2018welcome\u2019. Several participants reported a lack of \n 8\ninvolvement in situations in which practitioners made no time for friendly greetings and \ntreated them with detachment.  \nb) Interested and respectful of patients and their perspectives \nParticipants could feel involved when practitioners treated them \u2018as a person\u2019, \n\u2018took an active interest\u2019 and made them feel \u2018on a level\u2019 in discussions. In contrast, they \ndid not feel involved if practitioners asserted their superiority and imposed their own \nviews, disregarding patients\u2019 experiential expertise or feelings. One important aspect of \nbeing treated as a person was being recognised as an individual with particular interests \nand concerns. Several participants indicated that they did not feel involved if \npractitioners showed no regard for their life circumstances and plans.    \nc) Facilitative of patients\u2019 contributions to discussions and condition management \nParticipants associated involvement with practitioners making it easy for them to \ndiscuss their problems, inviting questions, \u2018really listening\u2019, answering their questions \nthoroughly, providing relevant information and explaining things well. Conversely, \nparticipants reported feeling less involved when practitioners appeared disinterested or \nwere dismissive of what they had to say.  \nd) Not unduly judgemental or patient-blaming   \nInvolvement was associated with patients feeling able to discuss their difficulties \nwith self-care regimens or the achievement of target weights and blood sugar levels and \nbeing confident that they would not be negatively judged. Several participants noted \nthat they had not felt involved when practitioners appeared to blame them for their \nhealth problems.   \nParticipants\u2019 comments about involvement often incorporated several of these \nsub-themes. Examples are presented in Box 1.  \n 9\n Some participants indicated that they could feel involved because they had a \ngood relationship with a practitioner whom they had got to know. Conversely, several \nregarded a lack of continuity of carer as something that militated against their \ninvolvement. Continuity of carer could underpin some \u2018ethos and feel\u2019 features. For \nexample, participants noted that it was easier to open up to and ask questions of a \nfamiliar, trusted \u2018regular practitioner\u2019, and that their regular practitioners were more \ninterested and caring than others. However, continuity of carer was not always \nnecessary to achieve these: one participant spoke most positively about a consultation \nwith a locum GP, a diabetic himself, who expressed an empathetic interest and \nexplained several issues that the participant had not previously understood. \n \n2. Communication about health problems \nAlthough our focus was on involvement in treatment decisions, communication \nabout health problems featured significantly in the interviews.  \na) Practitioners elicit patients\u2019 views of their situation and patients feel listened to  \nParticipants\u2019 narratives confirmed the importance that patients attach to \npractitioners eliciting, listening empathetically to and taking seriously the patient\u2019s own \nview of their symptoms, of how their diabetes affected their life (and not just how their \nlife affected their diabetes), and of their current treatment regime. Participants also often \nassociated these behaviours with involvement in treatment decisions. For example, one \nparticipant with numerous health problems recounted several occasions on which he had \nfelt obliged to insist that doctors pay attention to the problems he was trying to tell them \nabout. He explained that \u2018Yes, definitely\u2019 was the best answer to the National Patient \nSurvey question in relation to his recent consultation:  \n 10\nBecause I\u2019m outspoken! And from past experience, it\u2019s to have your input rather \nthan let them tell you. You know your body, you should be telling them [about \n\u2018allergies and that\u2019]. (03) \n \nParticipants could feel a lack of involvement if their own concerns about blood sugar \nreadings, symptoms or side-effects were dismissed or not taken up by their \npractitioners. For example, one woman (11) had been prescribed Metformin, which she \ntook regularly and \u2018didn\u2019t have a problem with\u2019 until she was told to increase the dose. \nAt two tablets daily she started to have problems with diarrhoea. When she was told to \nincrease the dose to four tablets daily, she expressed reluctance but was told she must \n\u2018give it a try\u2019. The diarrhoea worsened to the extent that she felt unable to leave her \nhome. When she telephoned the diabetic clinic, she was told emphatically that she must \ncontinue to take the tablets. The participant described this incident several times during \nher interview, stressing how frustrating and humiliating it was when her attempts to \nexplain the effect Metformin was having on her were not listened to. She eventually \ncontacted her GP who took the problem seriously and prescribed a different medication \nfor her diabetes. When asked during her interview how she would have answered the \nNational Patient Survey question if she had been asked it with reference to her contact \nwith the clinic about the problems she had with the Metformin, she said that her \nresponse would have been \u201ca definite no\u201d.  \n However, a lack of involvement was not only associated with practitioners\u2019 \nfailing to listen to patients\u2019 specific problem reports. Attention to patients\u2019 feelings \nabout the problems posed by their diabetes more generally was also seen as important. \nFor example:   \n 11\nI just think I would be more involved if he said to me \u2018[First name], I only see \nyou every six months. Tell me, now, how you really feel, how you really deal \nwith your diabetes, what problems, what do you feel the next 5 years are going \nto do for you?\u2019 and stuff like that. There\u2019s none of that. It\u2019s just, get in, \u2018yeah, \nyeah, the sugar levels are fine, they are 5.6, that\u2019s good\u2019. That\u2019s it. (02) \n \nb) Practitioners explain health problems and patients understand  \nSeveral participants mentioned that they had received (or taken in) relatively little \ninformation about diabetes and its management when they were first diagnosed. Only \nlater had they found out what they now regarded as crucial information about their \ncondition and its management - sometimes only after experiencing severe problems \nwith hypo- or hyper-glycaemia. When talking about involvement, these participants in \nparticular highlighted the importance of clear and timely explanations from practitioners \nabout diabetes and about how and why preventable problems occurred. For example: \nI: Can you describe how involved you like to be, then?  \nP: I like to know why. I don\u2019t want to just go into a doctor and say, I am ill, the \ndoctor ask me questions about my illness and then to be given a drug that fixes it \n\u2013 although that is nice sometimes. But with this particular illness [ketoacidosis] I \nwant to know why it happened, what I could have done to prevent it, will it \nhappen again? A lot more information than a \u201cjust take these and it won\u2019t \nhappen again\u201d sort of situation. (08)  \n \nHowever, the provision of too much complex information about diabetes could \nalso militate against a sense of involvement if it resulted in the patient feeling \noverwhelmed. One participant, who seemed quite confused about some aspects of \n 12\ndiabetes and its management, explained that he would have responded \u201cYes, to some \nextent\u201d to the National Patient Survey question because:  \nShe does involve you, but not to a fuller extent. She tries to explain things to \nyou, and you\u2019re trying to take it all in. Maybe there is a bit too much \ninformation, maybe not enough. (09) \n \n3. Communication about treatments  \nAll participants respected and wanted to avail themselves of practitioners\u2019 \nexpertise in relation to the management of their diabetes. They were generally inclined \nto accept treatment recommendations, although we heard several examples of patients \nhaving negotiated for something other than what their doctors first suggested. The few \n(including a nurse) who talked in terms of making \u2018informed choices\u2019 for themselves \nalso noted that they valued a \u2018steer\u2019 from health professionals. However, there was a \nstrong sense from across the interviews that people did not feel involved in decisions \nwhen practitioners \u2018dictated\u2019 a particular treatment without giving them a rationale for \nthat treatment and without giving them any hint of a \u2018say\u2019.  \na) Practitioners explain and patients understand the reasons for treatment \nParticipants frequently associated being given understandable explanations \nabout the rationale for proposed treatments with involvement in decisions, as these two \nresponses to the question \u201cHow involved do you like to be in treatment decisions?\u201d \nillustrate:  \nI prefer to know what is going on\u2026 I want to know if I am changing insulin why \nI am changing insulin\u2026 not just getting told \u201cYes, this would be better for you \nto change to\u201d. Then you go away thinking \u201cWhy am I bothering?\u201d I would \nprefer to know what is going on, why it is going on and things like that. (05) \n 13\n I like to be involved. I like to know why I have to take something and what it \ndoes to me. When they moved me onto Glimepride, it was explained what they \ndid, and I was quite happy to take them. And I was on Glimepride for a while \n\u2026, but the diabetes was getting worse and I needed something more, so they put \nme on to Rosiglitazone and explained what the Rosiglitazone did\u2026 I was quite \nhappy because I understood what she was saying. She was telling me what each \nof the tablets were doing. (11) \nTwo participants also suggested that they would feel more involved if practitioners \nproactively alerted them to the development of new treatments.  \n \nb) Practitioners make room for patient influence and patients feel they have a say \nIn addition to understanding the basis for possible or proposed treatments, all but \none of the participants also suggested that to be involved they needed to have some kind \nof say in or about their treatment. This could happen in several ways. First, some \nparticipants talked in terms of practitioners understanding their situation and priorities \nand tailoring treatment recommendations accordingly. For example:  \nI think the involvement is \u201cWell, the three drugs here, X, Y, Z. This one will be \ngood for you because you are an active person. This would be good if you were \nnon active, and this, well that\u2019s relatively new\u2026\u201d (02)  \nParticipant 11\u2019s reports of the different responses she received when she complained of \nsevere diarrhoea as a side effect of Metformin (see 2a above) are also relevant here.    \n 14\nSecond, some participants focused on practitioners\u2019 responses to their own \nsuggestions about possible treatments or self management plans. They could feel \ninvolved if practitioners listened to and discussed these. For example:  \nI: What kinds of things make you feel involved or uninvolved? \nP: I don\u2019t know if it is relevant\u2026 but [I prefer to see doctors older than myself] \nto me that is important because I feel they do listen, and if I was to make a \nsuggestion, even if it wasn\u2019t a balanced suggestion, then they wouldn\u2019t dismiss it \nbut they would find something to work round it as well\u2026 I feel that the younger \ndoctors are very headstrong and it is their word and that is it. (19) \n \nThird, and most frequently, involvement was associated with practitioners \nrecommending rather than ordering particular treatments, phrasing treatment proposals \nas suggestions, asking patients for their opinions and in some sense giving them an \noption. For example:  \nI: Why would you say that? [\u2018Yes, definitely\u2019 in response to NPS question] \nP: When I was asked if I wanted to test myself, the doctor didn\u2019t say I had to, he \nsaid if I wanted to. (20) \n \nI: So what kinds of things make you feel involved?  \nP: I think being asked how I feel about what they are suggesting. I think being \ngiven choices, you know, things being explained properly to you and then the \nquestion being put to you, well how do you feel about this, or how will this fit \ninto your lifestyle\u2026 I think if people took the time to sit with you and say, OK, \nhere is where you are at, here are our concerns, if we offered you this, how \n 15\nwould it fit in with you, or there is an alternative to this, and give you choices \nthat way. I think that would make me feel a lot more involved.  \nI: So what kind of things \u2026 make you feel not involved? \nP: I think when you\u2019re told this is what you need and there you go that is it.  \nWhen it is as black and white as that then I don\u2019t feel involved - when people are \nnot taking account of how you are feeling. (01) \n \nFor most participants it apparently sufficed that they felt they had scope to safely \nquery and say no to the practitioner\u2019s recommendation, and be confident that a \nreasonable alternative would be found if necessary.  \nI: How possible do you think it is for you to be involved in decisions about your \ncare? \nP: I think it is possible really, because if I don\u2019t want to do something or take \nsomething then I can just say and he will come up with a different \u2013 like an \nalternative. (20) \nA few participants mentioned appreciating being told explicitly that if they tried a \nparticular course of action and it did not suit them, an alternative could be found.    \nSeveral participants stressed that having a say was of little use if they lacked \nrelevant information or were unable to have a \u2018meaningful discussion\u2019 with their \npractitioners about what was being recommended and why. Few participants talked in \nterms of being given a menu of possibilities and information about each and being \nencouraged to select an option, but some did mention discussing possible medication \nchanges in one consultation with a view to making a decision in another.    \n \nDiscussion \n 16\n We have identified a number of features relating to communication about health \nproblems and treatments and to the ethos and feel of consultations that people with \ndiabetes associate with their involvement in treatment decisions. After considering the \nstrengths and limitations of our study, we discuss the implications of our findings for \nthe conceptualisation and assessment of patient involvement in decision-making and for \npractical efforts to promote patient involvement in decision-making.   \nOur study has several strengths. Our participants included men and women of \ndifferent ages with diverse experiences of diabetes. We invited them to discuss \ninvolvement in decision-making in specific recent consultations and previous healthcare \nepisodes, and they were able to refer to a range of treatment decisions and to compare \nand contrast their experiences of involvement in these. We used several questioning \nstrategies to explore what involvement meant to people. Also, for each of the features \nthat we identified as important for involvement we have examples of (a) patients who \nexperienced these features associating them positively with involvement and (b) \npatients who did not experience these features associating their absence with a lack of \ninvolvement.  \nThe main limitations of our study are: we studied only the views of people with \ndiabetes; some participants may not have experienced or been aware of some possible \nforms of involvement in decision-making; and we did not ask participants to comment \non features of healthcare that others had associated with involvement in decision-\nmaking. Our interest in understanding what people consider when responding to the \nNational Patient Survey question about involvement led to a focus particularly on \ninvolvement in the kinds of decisions considered during consultations with health \nprofessionals (mainly decisions about interventions to which health professionals \ncontrol access). We acknowledge that different issues would probably have emerged if \n 17\nwe had focused on patients\u2019 views about involvement in decision-making in relation to \ntheir daily self-management of their condition.  \nImplications for conceptualisation \nWe organised the issues that participants associated with involvement into three \ngroups relating to: the ethos and feel of healthcare encounters; communication about \nhealth problems; and communication about treatments. These are not mutually \nexclusive. Communication about health problems and treatments may contribute to and \nreflect the ethos and feel of healthcare encounters, and communication about health \nproblems and communication about treatments may overlap \u2013 consider, for example, \ndiscussions about treatment side effects. However, our groupings serve to draw \nattention to two issues (communication about problems and the ethos and feel of \nconsultations) that have been neglected in considerations of patient involvement that \nhave focused particularly on the exchange of information about treatment options and \npatients\u2019 influence on treatment selection.  \nCommunication about problems \nClinical\/academic models of patient-professional interaction during decision-\nmaking about the treatment of health problems often assume a clear and agreed problem \n(usually a specific diagnosis) as a starting point. Many of our participants, however, \nincluded communication about their health problems among the topics they associated \nwith involvement in treatment decision-making. Involvement was associated with \nhealth professionals attending to patients\u2019 experienced difficulties, understandings of \ntheir problems, and priorities for treatment and life.  \nThis finding is consistent with an analysis of consultation recordings that \nidentified attention to patients\u2019 thoughts about health problems as an important feature \nof  \u2018bilateral\u2019 approaches to decision-making by practitioners (Collins, Drew, Watt, \n 18\nEntwistle, 2005). It may have been particularly apparent in our data because all \nparticipants had a long-term health problem. However, it lends support from a patient \nperspective to recent suggestions that models of patient-professional interaction or \npatient involvement during decision-making need to accommodate problem clarification \nand prioritisation, especially if the health problems to be addressed are complex or may \nbe differently understood and prioritised by patients and health professionals (Entwistle \n& Watt, 2006; Murray, Charles and Gafni, 2006; Bugge, Entwistle & Watt, 2006).  \nThe ethos and feel of interactions   \nIt was striking that in their reflections on involvement in treatment decisions, our \nstudy participants placed a significant emphasis on the tone or manner of health \nprofessionals\u2019 communication, the interpersonal or relational messages that were \nconveyed by this, and the way they felt during consultations. Their subjective \nexperiences of being respected, encouraged and enabled (or not) were important \ninfluences on their sense of involvement (or otherwise) in treatment decisions. This is in \nsome contrast to the emphasis within the dominant policy\/professional discourse about \npatient involvement which emphasises the content of information exchanged about \ntreatment options and patients\u2019 preferences relating to these options. \nThe identification of features of the ethos and feel of interactions as important \naspects of patient involvement in decision-making might in part be an artefact of \npatients\u2019 tendencies to bring a broad range of concerns to interviews and be willing to \nassociate anything good about communication in healthcare with involvement in \ndecisions about their treatment. However, several considerations lead us to think that \nthese features should be considered integral to the concept of patient involvement in \ntreatment decision-making.  \n 19\nFirst, in our own study, participants referred to these features frequently, \nincluding in response to carefully worded questions about decision-making. They spoke \nabout issues relating to involvement with practitioners even though questions were \nphrased in terms of involvement in treatment decision-making (see Entwistle & Watt, \n2006).  \nSecond, the published findings from studies of patients\u2019 perspectives on related \nconcepts also suggest that features grouped under our \u2018ethos and feel\u2019 heading are \nconsidered by patients to be salient for involvement in decision-making. For example: \nconsumers who were asked about the outcomes that should be assessed in research into \nshared decision-making noted that they could not achieve the confidence required to \nparticipate in shared decision-making if they did not feel respected (Edwards, Elwyn, \nSmith, Williams & Thornton, 2001); adults who had been nominated as expert self-\nmanagers of their diabetes reported in the context of a study about empowerment that \nparticipatory decision-making was difficult to achieve when practitioners positioned \nthemselves as the expert or sole authority (Paterson, 2001); acute medical and surgical \npatients who were asked about their preferences for involvement in decisions about their \ncare identified clinicians\u2019 disinterest as a barrier to participation (Doherty & Doherty, \n2003); and UK citizens who were asked about involvement in consultations made \ncomments to the effect that: informing a patient is insufficient for involvement if there \nis \u2018no contact\u2019 in the discussion; there is a need for rapport and a feeling of having a \ndiscussion over and above an exchange of questions and answers; and it is of key \nimportance that patients feel that they and their opinions are valued (Thompson, 2007).  \nThird, involvement does have a relational dimension and it is a function of \nsubjective perceptions of engagement and affinity as well as of the more readily \n 20\nobservable aspects of action and information exchange. There is no obvious reason for \nexcluding these from considerations of patient involvement in decision-making.  \nAll this suggests that the models or taxonomies of patient involvement that \nemphasise information exchange and patient influence over option selection will need to \nbe expanded or modified to accommodate the relational and subjective factors that our \n\u2018ethos and feel\u2019 features relate to. There have already been a few moves in this \ndirection. Montori, Gafni and Charles (2006) recently suggested adding \u2018establishing an \nongoing partnership\u2019 as a new first phase of the shared treatment decision-making \nmodel, and encouraged recognition that this partnership would and should evolve over \nthe course of patient-professional communications. Entwistle and Watt (2006) proposed \na conceptual framework for examining involvement in decision-making in which \ncommunication relating to decision-making was presented as central and patients\u2019 and \nclinicians\u2019 feelings and views about their relationships with each other featured as two \nof six other domains of involvement. Our findings endorse the inclusion of at least the \npatient\u2019s subjective perspective on the relationship. They also suggest that the central \ndomain of this framework might need to be developed to emphasise other aspects of \ninterpersonal communication in addition to the transmission of information about \nparticular topics. These could include verbal and non-verbal cues that signal or foster \nunderstanding, respect, trust, relational orientation and commitment.  \nThe incorporation of ethos and feel factors within the conceptualisation of \npatient involvement will complicate attempts to assess the extent or quality of patient \ninvolvement. They tend to broaden the focus of interest out beyond a punctate treatment \ndecision. Also, while they are at least partially constituted by or within instances of \ninformation exchange, they nonetheless form an additional dimension of interest and \nwill thus be difficult to incorporate within hierarchical taxonomies that distinguish \n 21\nbetween levels of involvement on the basis of patterns of topic-focused information \nexchange and influence over option selection.  \nThe relative significance of ethos and feel factors within an overall assessment \nof involvement is likely to vary for patients with different characteristics and facing \ndifferent decisions. The weighting that should be given to them will need further \nconsideration. However, their importance was highlighted by a survey of recently \ndischarged hospital inpatients which found that being treated with respect and dignity, \nand having confidence and trust in healthcare providers were more strongly associated \nwith patients\u2019 willingness to recommend a hospital than having been given enough say \nabout treatment (Joffe, Manocchia, Weeks & Cleary, 2003).     \nImplications for policy and practice \nOur findings suggest that if policy-makers and healthcare practitioners aspire to \ninvolve patients in decisions in the ways that patients appreciate, they will need to \nensure that patients feel welcome, respected, supported as contributors and cared for in \nhealthcare encounters; that their experiences of and concerns about their health \nproblems and treatment are seriously attended to; and that they are given explanations \nabout the medical view of their health problems that they can understand. Our \nparticipants varied in terms of their expectations about information about treatment \noptions and their influence over decisions, but it seems that a minimum requirement for \na sense of involvement is having an understandable rationale for any proposed treatment \nand a belief that they could safely query and decline any proposed treatments and \nexplore alternatives with their clinician if required.   \nPatients\u2019 views about what matters are increasingly regarded as normative \nguides to the development and delivery of health services, but our study participants\u2019 \nviews cannot serve as comprehensively indicative of the forms that efforts to promote \n 22\npatient involvement should take. We do not think our findings imply that efforts to \nensure patients are well informed and enabled to appraise treatment options themselves \nare all misguided. Our participants might not have experienced or been able to imagine \nbeing offered information about several treatment options simultaneously and being \nsupported in the appraisal of each of these against their relevant preferences. The forms \nof involvement they expressed interest in were probably constrained by what they were \nfamiliar with. The appropriateness in different contexts of different approaches to \ninforming patients about options and enabling them to have a say remains contested.  \nOur study findings also have practical implications for those tasked with \naddressing problems flagged up by responses to the National Patient Survey. They \nsuggest that people who indicate they were not as involved as they wanted to be may be \nreflecting on disrespectful and disempowering communication from staff and\/or a lack \nof attention to their views about their health problems as well (perhaps) as a lack of \ninformation about treatment options and\/or a lack of opportunity to influence treatment \nselection in more than a veto-holding way. Healthcare providers who achieve low \npatient feedback scores on this question might need to do more than provide treatment \nmenus and offer choice.   \nConclusion \nOur investigation of patients\u2019 understandings of involvement in treatment \ndecision-making has highlighted the insufficiency of models and practices that focus \nnarrowly on the exchange of information about treatment options and the activation of \npatients as choosers. It leads us to suggest that clinicians and researchers with an \ninterest in patient involvement in decision-making need to attend to communication \nabout health problems and to the ethos and feel of patient-practitioner interactions.  \n 23\nAttention to the more diffuse relational and affective aspects of patient \ninvolvement in decision-making would be consistent with, and perhaps facilitative of, a \nproposed shift in emphasis for normative thinking about communication and decision-\nmaking in healthcare. In particular it would be congruent with suggestions that \nbioethical concern should focus less intensely on \u2018choice\u2019 about \u2018punctate decisions\u2019 as \na means of respecting autonomy, and pay more attention to a broader set of ethical \nconsiderations relating to respect for patients as persons (Joffe et al, 2003; Kukla, 2005; \nO\u2019Neill 2002).  \n \n \nReferences \nBeauchamp, T.L. & Childress, J.F.

You never feel that there is \nanything I couldn\u2019t mention to my doctor. And again I don\u2019t feel that I have to mention \nthings\u2026 I don\u2019t think that he would pressure me into saying anything\u2026 You don\u2019t feel \nthat they are saying \u201cThis is what you have to do\u201d or \u201cWhatever happens to you is your \nfault\u201d kind of thing. (05) \n \n1c, 1d \nInvolvement. \u2026 just giving me some flexibility and understanding about my lifestyle \nand my personal life and not dictating going back to the old school doctoring diabetes. \nAnd a bit of leeway. It makes me feel more confident that I can ask more and I hear more \nwhat they have to say as well. (19) \n \n1b, 1c \nMainly discussion. I mean as a patient you do tend to think (well, I do!) if you try and get \ninvolved in the discussion process, is the consultant or the doctor feeling that \u201cLook, I \nam the expert, don\u2019t question me. You are asking questions. Don\u2019t question my ability\u201d \ntype of thing. Are you interfering? You do sometimes feel that. (13) \n \n1b, 1c \nExplanations for responses to National Patient Survey question  \n[Yes, definitely] Because \u2026 I got the feeling that if there was anything that I wanted to \nask her she would have answered to the best of her ability and she was very open and \nfriendly. She wasn\u2019t the least bit intimidating or anything like that. (04) \n \n1a \n[Yes, definitely] \u2026 Well, the fact that she asks [about various other problems as well as \ndiabetes]\u2026 So I feel that she is taking an active interest not only in my diabetes, in \neverything. (06) \n \n1c \n[Yes, to some extent] \u2026 I think the impression I\u2019ve always had with the diabetic clinic is \nthey try really hard to deal with the patients they have. I don\u2019t think they have time to do \nthemselves justice you know because I suppose they\u2019re just seeing a line of people going \npast. There\u2019s no relationship with a doctor or nurse\u2026 They just see you as a face that\u2019s \ngoing past them. Did you have cotton wool in your ear. They take the blood, they \nscribble it up, they write a number on it, \u201cOK, down you go and sit down there\u201d\u2026[14] \n \n1b \n[Yes, definitely] \u2026 I feel I am in very good charge of my own diabetes because I have \nhad it for so long\u2026 They have recommended, obviously they like me to exercise \u2026 and \nI did say that it has been a bit hard to do it at the moment [due to working long hours in \nresponse to an opportunity with tight deadlines]\u2026 I am comfortable in the fact that I can \ntake a week off being a strict regimental diabetic as long as I keep an eye on my levels. \n\u2026 I\u2019m comfortable enough to tell my doctor this and he is comfortable enough knowing \nthe fact that I will go back to being in control again. (19)  \n \n1d \nOther questions  \nI: Is there anything else you would like to say about involvement in decisions?  \nP: I cannot see how you can be involved when it\u2019s so impersonal\u2026 You cannot get \ninvolved\u2026 I get the impression you get these young doctors that are doing 6 months in \nthe diabetic clinic and it\u2019s knocking in time for them (11) \n1a, 1b \n \n 30\n"}
