However, for successful viral suppression, patients must adhere to rigid and complex treatment regimens. With three quarters of antiretroviral (ARV) users in Africa adhering successfully, African countries have achieved extraordinary levels of adherence given the levels of poverty in which many ARV users live. Nevertheless, one quarter of ARV users still struggle to adhere and run the risk of experiencing viral replication, clinical progression or even drug resistance. Much has been written about ART adherence, but little has been done to systematically categorise the spectrum of factors that influence ART. In this paper, we use a Zimbabwean case study to develop a framework for ART programme planners and implementers seeking to identify and tackle social obstacles to adherence. We draw on interviews and group discussions with 25 nurses and 53 adult ARV users, which we analysed through a three-tiered thematic approach, allowing us to categorise our findings into broader dimensions that can transcend our case study and be applied elsewhere.

It is estimated that 44% of\nAfricans with advanced HIV infection are currently receiving ART (WHO, 2010).\nHowever, ART programme planners and implementers should not measure their\nsuccess through the number of people receiving ART at a given time but also take into\naccount their patients\u2019 successful compliance to treatment. The virologic efficacy of\nART, or \u2018good adherence\u2019, is better achieved if patients stick to their treatment\nregimen for 95% of the time (Attaran, 2007). In resource\u2010poor settings this is not easy\nto achieve, and many fail to adhere in the long term (Rosen et al., 2007). Although\nmuch work has been done to inform ART programme planners and implementers of\nparticular determinants and predictors of poor ART adherence, no efforts have yet\nbeen made to develop a framework that allows them to analyse the spectrum of social\nand behavioural factors influencing ART adherence. In this paper, we seek to\ncontribute to the development of such an analytical framework, believing this will\nhelp ART programme planners and implementers to pinpoint possible obstacles and\nfacilitators to adherence. To do this, we \u2018mined\u2019 our user\u2010service interface study for\nany information that threw light on factors facilitating or hindering adherence. On the\nbasis of a \u2018grounded theory\u2019 analysis of the views of ART users and providers in rural\nZimbabwe\u2014a country where no other study on ART adherence has yet been carried\nout\u2014two levels of analysis emerged, namely, the contextual and psychosocial.\nThe ART adherence rate in sub\u2010Saharan Africa compares favourably with that in\nNorth America (Mills et al., 2006a, 2006b). However, virologic failure still occurs\nin settings with otherwise high levels of reported adherence (Bisson et al., 2008),\nraising questions about how adherence is measured and monitored (Chalker et al.,\n2008). The time frame in which adherence is measured must be considered. A\nreview of the literature, for example, found that only 60% of ART users in sub\u2010\nSaharan Africa were still enrolled onto an ART programme after 2 years (Rosen\net al., 2007). This, coupled with less successful programmes going unreported (Gill\net al., 2005) and numerous studies continuing to report poor levels of adherence\n(Uzochukwu et al., 2009), suggests that there is no room for complacency in\naddressing the factors that either facilitate or undermine ART adherence.\nThe majority of research on ART adherence in Africa is heavily focused on barriers.\nThe common barriers identified in both qualitative and quantitative studies include\nstigma, treatment\u2010related costs, distance to and waiting times at health facilities,\nperceptions of side effects, lack of food and inadequate knowledge of ART (Weiser\net al., 2003; Mshana et al., 2006; Hardon et al., 2007; Dahab et al., 2008; Posse et al.,\n2008; Murray et al., 2009; Roura et al., 2009). However, also gender (Kempf et al.,\n2009; Uzochukwu et al., 2009), alcohol use (Nachega et al., 2006; Dahab et al., 2008;\nFitzgerald et al., 2010), depression, hopelessness, psychopathology (Murray et al.,\n2009; Adewuya et al., 2010), forgetfulness, complacency (Krebs et al., 2008) and\ndissatisfaction with hospital facilities and staff (Mshana et al., 2006; Sanjobo et al.,\n2008; Kip et al., 2009) have meant that some patients do not achieve optimalCopyright \u00a9 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Int J Health Plann Mgmt 2011; 26: 296\u2013318.\nDOI: 10.1002\/hpm\n298 M. SKOVDAL ET AL.adherence. Although a few of these studies refer in passing to the potential facilitators\nof ART adherence, only a handful of studies have looked explicitly at the facilitators of\nART adherence (cf. Ware et al., 2009; Watt et al., 2009b). Some of the facilitators that\nhave been identified include encouragement from peers, perceived health benefits,\nhope and personal motivation (Roura et al., 2009), social support, treatment partners,\nbelief in value of treatment, living up to social responsibilities, opportunities to fit ART\ninto a daily routine (Dahab et al., 2008; Ware et al., 2009), feeling better, having\nknowledge about ART, engagement with income\u2010generating activities (IGAs),\ndisclosure of HIV status and praying (Sanjobo et al., 2008; Watt et al., 2009b).\nIt is clear that much information has been gathered to explain what factors may\nfacilitate and undermine ART adherence. However, it appears that many studies are\nguided by health behaviour theories, often at the expense of how behaviours such as\nART adherence are enabled or supported by the wider social environments in which\nbehavioural decisions are made. The health behaviour theories that have been used\ninclude the information, motivation and behavioural skills model (Peltzer et al.,\n2010), the health belief model (cf. Wringe et al., 2009) and social cognitive theory\n(cf. Watt et al., 2009a). All of these focus on the individual level of analysis, with\nbehaviour viewed as the outcome of conscious rational choice. In this paper, we\nseek to move beyond a focus on individual behaviour shaped by cognitions such as\nattitudes, beliefs and motivations, to improve our understandings of how the social\nenvironment shapes the links between cognition and behaviour, with particular\nattention to the way in which particular forms of behaviour are enabled or limited\nwithin specific local contexts.\nSome efforts have been made to examine ART adherence in relation to social\ncontexts, for example, by using socioecological theories (Posse et al., 2008; Roura\net al., 2009) and theories of social capital (Ware et al., 2009). Ware et al. (2009)\nfocused on the influence of social relations on adherence in Nigeria, Tanzania and\nUganda by highlighting the role of social relationships in facilitating adherence,\narguing that in conditions of chronic poverty, people on ART adhere in order to\nensure that family members who support them remain motivated to do so. Although\nthese theories help us get a little closer to understanding the behaviours that govern\nART adherence, they only provide us with a snapshot of a handful of factors in any\ngiven context. It is against this background, and in view of our belief that healthcare\u2010\nseeking behaviours are determined by social factors and not merely a result of\nindividual choices, that we seek to construct an analytical framework of the\nspectrum of factors that influence ART adherence in Zimbabwe. In doing so, we\nhope to contribute to the evolving \u2018fourth generation\u2019 model of AIDS management\noutlined below.TOWARDS AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING\nANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY ADHERENCE\nIn their review of the evolution of approaches to promoting health\u2010enhancing HIV\/\nAIDS\u2010related behaviours in the field of HIV prevention, Campbell and Cornish (2010)\nidentify three generations of approaches, namely, information provision, peerCopyright \u00a9 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Currently, much emphasis is placed on the\nimportance of community mobilisation in behaviour change efforts. Critiquing\ncommunity\u2010focused approaches as being too narrow in their scope, Campbell and\nCornish (2010) argue that health\u2010related behaviours are often shaped by many factors\nthat lie beyond the boundaries of the local communities within which AIDS\u2010affected\npeople live andwork. They speak of the urgent need to develop systematic accounts of\nthe social contexts that frame community responses to health. Such a focus would\nconstitute a \u2018fourth generation\u2019 of approaches to HIV\/AIDS management, one which\nacknowledges the need to understand and target not only individuals and communities\nbut also the wider social contexts in which communities are located.\nCampbell and Cornish (2010) provide a preliminary conceptualisation of three\ndimensions of social context in which the members of AIDS\u2010affected communities\nmake health decisions, namely, the material, symbolic and relational dimensions of\ntheir social environments. They developed this conceptualisation in the context of the\nparticular challenges of HIV prevention in South Africa and India, concluding that\nthere is a need to amend and develop their account of context in a wider range of\nsettings. In this paper, we use their framework as the starting point for our focus on\nAIDS treatment.\nAs such, we take \u2018material context\u2019 to refer to the extent to which people have\naccess to the resources that they need to be healthy, including, for example,\nopportunities for paid employment, access to food aid, microcredit schemes or\nwelfare grants. The \u2018symbolic context\u2019 consists of the meanings, the representations\nand the ideologies that circulate within a society, including the representations of\ngender and the presence or absence of AIDS stigma, which can either help AIDS\u2010\naffected people cope (through enabling positive identity constructions and tolerant\nand inclusive social relations) or be a source of social exclusion and discrimination\n(Campbell et al. 2011c). The final dimension of context described by Campbell and\nCornish (2010) is the \u2018relational context\u2019, referring to the quality of relationships and\npartnerships between health service users, providers and funders as well as family\nand community relations. It should, however, be said that all three dimensions are\nintrinsically linked and reflect social relations within a community. If, for example,\nstigmatising attitudes (symbolic) are common in a given community, this may\nreflect poor social relations (relational), which in turn makes it harder for people to\nnegotiate access to support (material).\nAs the contexts of HIV prevention and treatment programmes differ, with, for\nexample, treatment programmes more dependent on health facilities and nurse\u2013\npatient relationships, we do not seek merely to adapt this three\u2010level framework.\nInstead, we report on an empirical study that enables us to advance, expand and\nredevelop the framework proposed by Campbell and Cornish (2010)\u2014specifically\nfor the contextual analysis and action of ART adherence programmes in Africa.METHODOLOGY\nThe research question guiding this paper is: What social factors influence adherence\nto ART? The study from which we seek to answer this question is ongoing and wasCopyright \u00a9 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Int J Health Plann Mgmt 2011; 26: 296\u2013318.\nDOI: 10.1002\/hpm\n300 M.

Informed and written consent was\ngathered from all the participants with the agreement that their identities would not\nbe revealed. Pseudonyms have therefore been used throughout.\nStudy setup and sampling\nThis study was conducted in the Manicaland province of eastern Zimbabwe. The\nimpact of the AIDS epidemic on Zimbabwe has been devastating, but after peaking\nwith an HIV prevalence rate at 26.5% in 1997, the prevalence rate has stabilised and\nwas, in 2009, 14.3% (Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Welfare, 2009). This\nfollows reductions in high\u2010risk behaviours between 1999 and 2004, and AIDS\nmortality beginning to level off (Gregson et al., 2010). This study included\nparticipants from three rural sites, all of which are characterised by high levels of\npoverty. The majority of people living in these three communities are in informal\nemployment or survive through subsistence farming. The three health clinics serving\nthe communities all administer antiretroviral (ARV) drugs. The decentralisation of\nART services to include even smaller rural health clinics has helped Zimbabwe\nprovide treatment for 215 000 people (57% of those living with AIDS), and further\nefforts are being made to increase uptake (UNAIDS, 2010). It was through the three\nhealth clinics that we recruited our research participants. As Table 1 summarises, we\nrecruited 25 nurses and 53 adult ARV users. The ARV users were sampled using a\nmix of snowball (using village community health workers), opportunistic (self\u2010\nselected informants) and typical case (e.g. adherers to ART) sampling, and the\nnurses were recruited on the basis of their willingness to participate in the study.\nData collection and analysis\nFour experienced and Shona\u2010speaking researchers collected the data for this study in\nOctober and November 2009. As illustrated in Table 1, they conducted 37\nindividual in\u2010depth interviews and five focus groups discussions, with the former\nlasting on an average of 1 h and the latter 2 h and 20min. To keep the interviews\nfocused, the local researchers used semi\u2010structured topic guides, covering their\npersonal background, their experiences of AIDS, stigma and ART treatment as well\nas the barriers and the facilitators of access and adherence to ART. The focus groups\ndiscussions not only followed a similar topic guide but also engaged the participants\nin a role play, demonstrating a typical patient\u2013nurse interaction in an ART context.\nWith their consent, we digitally recorded the interviews, allowing us to transcribe\nverbatim and translate the interviews into English. The transcripts were subsequentlyTable 1.

Step 1 was to code text segments with an interpretative title. This process\ngenerated a total of \u2018225\u2019 codes. As we were not seeking to report on all of these codes,\nwe began, guided by the conceptual framework and reviews of the literature, to explore\nhow the codes are interconnected and identified dominant and relevant basic themes that\nemerged from the codes (step 2). These basic themes highlighted some of the factors\ninfluencing ART adherence. We then clustered these factors into higher\u2010order themes,\nor the so\u2010called organising themes (step 3), giving rise to the dimensions of our\nproposed framework.Wefinally clustered the organising themes into two global themes\n(step 4), indicating two levels of analysis, namely, contextual and psychosocial. We\nhave illustrated this process in Tables 2 and 3, which outline each of the two levels of\nanalysis as well as the dimensions (organising themes) that came from our interviews\nand their relationships. Through these steps, we have developed a data\u2010driven\nconceptual framework of the contextual and psychosocial dimensions that influence\nART adherence. We will now turn to describe and elaborate on the emerging themes\n(step 5), using the global and organising themes as the headings.CONTEXTUAL DIMENSIONS INFLUENCING ANTIRETROVIRAL\nTHERAPY ADHERENCE\nIn this rural context, remarkable progress has been made in the distribution of ART. Both\nthe patients and the nurses were very positive about the introduction and the scale up of\nART; however, they also agreed that many challenges were still outstanding. ART\nrequires much commitment and participation from patients. Once patients have tested\npositive and experienced some of the first and early symptoms of HIV\/AIDS, they will\ncommence the treatment process. Their CD4 count levels are measured, and they are\ncounselled on the treatment regimen\u2014which includes timely and daily administration of\nthe drugs. Patients will stay on ART for the rest of their lives and are in this context\nrequired to show up for monthly review consultations where the nurses monitor the\npatients\u2019 progress and provide them with their monthly supply of ARVs. Although many\npatients in our study, in principle, were committed to adhering, a number of contextual\nfactors shaped the likelihood that theywould do so in practice. Concurringwith Campbell\nand Cornish\u2019s (2010) framework, we found a number of material, symbolic and relational\nfactors to both undermine and facilitate ART adherence (See Table 2). In this paper,\nhowever, we discuss the relational context from two perspectives where \u2018relational\u2019 refers\nto personal relationships and \u2018institutional\u2019 refers to relationships with agencies.\nMaterial\nIn the interviews, both the patients and the nurses referred to poverty as a key constraint\non adherence, impacting on the patients\u2019 ability to take their drugs in a range of different\nways. Some of the more prevalent material dimensions influencing ART adherence\nreflect the high levels of poverty that characterise the context of this study and primarily\nrefer to a lack of food and money compromising their treatment.Copyright \u00a9 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Patients who cannot afford adequate levels of\nfood often also struggle to meet the transport costs associated with going to the health\nclinic to attend monthly medical reviews and to pick up their monthly supplies of\ndrugs. This was particularly the case with patients who lived further away and who\nhad no other choice but to walk (because of either inadequate transport infrastructure\nor the costs)\u2014but often unable to find the time and energy to make the journey.\n\u2018Distance may discourage someone to come for medication.

Aside from the costs related to getting to the clinics, the treatment\nitself also came at a cost. This is despite the fact that the ARVs are given for free. The\nthree health facilities through which we recruited our informants all charged patients\n$1 for their monthly consultation\u2014a cost many patients struggled to meet.\n\u2018Some patients fail to raise money for the transport to come and collect their\nsupplies and pay for their consultation fee. These are people who don\u2019t have\nany source of income. Sometimes they spend a lot of time trying to sell their\nproduce and they might forget to take their tablets.\u2019 Alice, nurse\n\u2018We are unable to raise that dollar every month when we go for reviews.\u2019Austine,\npatient\nPatients who struggle with food and attending monthly consultations are less\nlikely to adhere and therefore more likely to experience opportunistic infections.\nAlthough people can have free ARVs, they have to pay for the treatment of\nopportunistic infections, a cost that is often so unaffordable that the patients do not\nsee anything to be gained from seeking medical advice.Copyright \u00a9 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We will discuss how some patients overcome these problems in the next\nsection, for example, by engaging in IGAs.\nSymbolic\nVarious dimensions of symbolic context appeared to serve as both barriers and\nfacilitators of adherence. The barriers discussed below include fear of being\nrecognised as an AIDS patient, reflecting a continued presence of stigma and\nwomen\u2019s disempowered position within their household. The facilitators included\nthe growing awareness of AIDS and ART as well as a diminishing dependence on\ntraditional healers, whose advice was seen by many to contradict the biomedical\nadvice that they saw as more useful in their current condition.\nFear of being recognised as an AIDS patient. Although many patients reported that\nsince the advent of ART there had been a reduction in the stigmatisation of\nPLWHA, many patients, particularly men, spoke of feeling the fear and the\nembarrassment associated with being recognised as an AIDS patient, saying that\nstigma served as a barrier to the timely accessing of services by many men.\n\u2018Men are generally afraid to be identified as HIV positive. They are shy and they\nmay only \u201ccome out\u201d after they get seriously ill. Some are afraid that people will\nlaugh at them or look down upon them for being HIV positive.\u2019 John, patient\nOnce enrolled onto ART, many men were deterred from attending the monthly\nconsultations that required them to go to the \u2018AIDS clinic\u2019 and wait in long queues\ntogether with other AIDS patients. In such a situation, they were unable to keep their\nstatus a secret, and many found this prospect intolerable.\n\u2018People know that this is the AIDS clinic. Some patients when they come here,\nthey will go past the place. Then when they see me going out of the clinic, perhaps\nto go for tea, they will approach me secretly to ask me privately to attend to them.\nWhen I ask him to come into the clinic hewill be distressed to see that there is \u201cMrs\nso and so\u201d on the bench, whom he did not want to \u201ccome out\u201d to.\u2019Claudius, nurse.\nWomen\u2019s disempowered position within households. In this context, women\u2019s\nsocial and often disempowered position stands in the way of their ability to adhere to\ntreatment. Bridget had travelled from Manicaland to see her husband, a migrant\nworker lodging in Harare, to collect money for their children\u2019s school fees.\nHowever, her husband decided to spend the money on his girlfriends, refusing to\ngive her the money she would need to travel back to Manicaland to collect her ARV\ntreatment.Copyright \u00a9 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

He took his money from work\nand went to his girlfriend\u2019s place. The second month he did the same thing. It\nwas only in the third month that he gave me money so I could travel back.\nWhen I came back home after the third month I went to the clinic and\nexplained to them that I hadn\u2019t been able to take my treatment for almost three\nmonths, because my husband would not give me the money to come back. The\nnurses were not impressed\u2014but I was honest and they tried to help me, that\u2019s\nwhy I had to go for CD4 tests again.\u2019 Bridget, patient.\nBridget\u2019s economic dependence on her unreliable husband highlights women\u2019s\nmarginalised position in this context. The husbands\u2019 unwillingness to accept their\nwives\u2019HIV status, and to support their treatment, can sometimes result in women being\nthreatened with divorce if they insist that they are HIV positive in the face of their\nhusbands\u2019 disbelief and if they express determination to adhere to their ART treatment.\n\u2018Some men refuse to believe that their wives are HIV positive. They\nthemselves refuse to come to the clinic and get tested. Sometimes, if the wife\ncomes here to get services, the husband will threaten to divorce the wife if she\ncontinues taking ARVs. This will affect her adherence.\u2019 Claudius, nurse\nThis suggests that women\u2019s economic dependence on men, facilitated by local\nconstructions of gender, can serve as a barrier to women\u2019s adherence.AIDS and antiretroviral therapy in the public sphere. In an effort to curtail the AIDS\nepidemic, many information campaigns have sought to educate the general public\nregarding how AIDS is spread and what treatment opportunities are available\u2014\nimprinting AIDS into the public sphere.\n\u2018People now know that there is this disease. It is talked about on radio and\ntelevision, people being told when to take pills and that these pills can help, that\ncondoms can help you to prevent HIV. Condoms are encouraged on the radio,\nand nurses in hospitals speak about not having too many partners.\u2019 Joe, patient\nA recent WHO study suggested that 45% of Zimbabwean youth aged 15\u201324 years\nare in possession of comprehensive and correct knowledge of HIV\/AIDS (WHO,\n2010), testifying to the fact that the \u2018wall of silence\u2019 and denial that characterised the\nepidemic\u2019s earlier stages are gradually coming down, and AIDS is increasingly\nbeing acknowledged as a fact of life. This increasing social acknowledgement of the\nproblem, coupled with the fact that contracting AIDS is no longer a death sentence,\nhas made it easier for some people to be tested and to accept their HIV status.\n\u2018People now have the information and are now encouraging each other to go\nfor HIV tests. People now know that there are ARVs and if one tests HIV\npositive then there is hope because ARVs are now available.\u2019 Chris, patient\nAs AIDS transmission and treatment technologies become part and parcel of the\npublic sphere, people\u2019s faith in unhelpful traditional interpretations and \u2018cures\u2019 diminish.Copyright \u00a9 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Most people in Zimbabwe have\nsomehow been affected by AIDS and have some knowledge about the disease.\nThis has meant that fewer people are resorting to traditional cures and explanations\nsuch as witchcraft, which were common at the earlier stages of the epidemic, and,\nwith the introduction of ART, are appreciating the potential of biomedical\ntechnologies\u2014giving them less reason to visit traditional healers.\n\u2018When I first fell ill, I believed it was witchcraft, I did not know better.When I was\nthen tested for HIV and found to be positive I felt relieved. I toldmy relatives not to\ngo witch hunting if I die, knowing I will die from AIDS. Normally people would\ngo to a witch doctor if their relative dies to find who really has caused the death. I\nthen went through the whole process and I am now on ARVs and I am recovering\nwell. I don\u2019t see the benefit of going to a traditional healer.\u2019 Violet, patient\nRelational\nART adherence is heavily influenced by the social relationships that exist between\nART users and the people they interact with on a daily basis, including family and\ncommunity members as well as service providers. In this subsection, we highlight\nthe important role played by social support, treatment partners and sustaining good\nrelationships with nurses in facilitating adherence.\nThe availability of social support. In conditions of poverty, a key contributing\nfactor to ART adherence is social support. One patient highlighted how people in his\nvillage have organised themselves so that they all support one another.\n\u2018The best thing about my village is the way we are living. When it comes to\nploughing, people share knowledge so that they can plant for themselves and sell\nto each other. People are encouraging each other to take their children to school. If\nthere is anyone who is sick, and the relatives have died, people will come and\nhelp.\u2019 Karren, patient\nIn addition to support from community members, the patients participating in this\nstudy also spoke about the importance of support from other ART users in providing\nencouragement and advice. Such support was available both through support groups\nand through friends.\n\u2018We have our support group and I have a friend who always encourage me and\ntry to make me have a positive attitude when I am down. I also do the same\nwith fellow HIV sufferers. We try to up lift each other.\u2019 Everline, patient\nFamily support and treatment partners. Also, family members play an integral part\nin a patient\u2019s adherence to ART. As the testimonies from Christine and Garikai\nsuggest, it is crucial that family members are aware and have an understanding of\ntheir treatment regimen so that they can help remind the patient about when to take\ndrugs and when to attend consultations.\n\u2018My family encourages me and urge me not to miss my appointments because\nthey now appreciate how these drugs have helpedme to recover.\u2019 Pamela, patientCopyright \u00a9 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Both nurses and patients spoke about the qualities and the\ncharacteristics of a \u2018good patient\u2019, indicating the importance of patients conforming to\nthe norms of the \u2018good patient persona\u2019. This required some level of relationship\nbuilding between patients and nurses, which could result in either productive and\nhealth\u2010enabling patient\u2013nurse relationships or a breakdown in communication, which\ncould be detrimental to the patient who would end up fearing going to see the nurse.\n\u2018I think a patient who follows what the nurse advised is the patient they think is\ngood. A patient who takes all the tablets as directed and completes the course as\nwell as coming back for reviews. A patient who adheres to what the nurses who\nhave taught, to the nurses this will be a good patient I think.\u2019 Albert, patient\n\u2018A good patient will never miss their appointments or even default on their time\nof taking pills because they understand why they are taking those pills and they\nalso don\u2019t want to spoil their relationship with us.\u2019 Joe, nurse\nIt was evident that social relationships play a key role in facilitating or undermining\nART adherence.\nInstitutional support\nAt an institutional level, churches, non\u2010governmental organisations (NGOs) and\nhealth services all influence a patient\u2019s ability to adhere to ART.\nChurches influence antiretroviral therapy adherence. Our informant\u2019s had mixed\nresponses to the role of their church in facilitating or undermining ART adherence.\nThe Apostolic Church was often cited for ignoring the impact of AIDS and\ndiscouraging its followers to take medicines. However, not all churches and\ndenominations were a barrier to ART. Some churches actively discouraged\ntraditional medicines and healing and promoted AIDS testing and ARVs.\n\u2018What discourages some people to take their tables is the church. Many churches\ndon\u2019t encourage people to go to the hospital [\u2026] The church that I attend is different,\nthey don\u2019t allow traditional medicine so I now rely on pills only.\u2019 Karren, patient\nNon\u2010governmental organisations\u2019 role in mobilising support. A number of faith\u2010\nbased and international NGOs worked actively in the area of study. The organisations\nwere reported to be providing people with AIDS information and to be supporting\nthose who are already on ART. Aside from training community health workers and\nproviding encouragement for PLWHA, NGOs were found to distribute food to ARV\nusers\u2014an activity that provided an incentive for non\u2010ARV users to go and be tested.Copyright \u00a9 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Almost everyone came for testing.\u2019 June, nurse\nMany of the services provided by NGOs were co\u2010ordinated with the local health\nclinic to ensure that their services reached ARV users.\nQuality of health services. With the ARV roll\u2010out came the training of nursing staff\nand a decentralisation of CD4 count machines to speed up ARV reviews. All of\nthese, together with the availability of free ARVs, have improved people\u2019s trust and\nperception in the quality of healthcare services available to them.\n\u2018Many people can now access ARVs for free. Before people were worried about\nthe CD4 cell tests which used to be done in Mutare Town before our local clinic\ngot the machine. Previously, patients would need to come twice before getting\ntheir results processed. This influenced the treatment of some people. But since\nwe got the CD4 count machine we have been running smoothly.\u2019 Colin, nurse\nHaving said this, despite the progress that has been made, many challenges\nremain, including the shortage of health staff. One patient explained how staff\nshortages (resulting in long waiting times) can discourage patients from going for\ntheir check\u2010ups.\n\u2018There are times when we feel it is impossible to see a Doctor, and one might as\nwell just discontinue treatment and stop going there only to waste time waiting in\nthe queue.\u2019 Rose, patient\nOther challenges faced by the health services, undermining the quality of services\navailable to ARV users, include continued resource constraints, poor management,\ndifficulties with repairing dysfunctional equipment, power cuts and limited access to\nwater. This subsection has underlined some of the pathways through which the\navailability and quality of institutional support can influence ART adherence.\nThe above dimensions of context can all influence ART adherence. However,\nthey also provide the platform through which psychosocial behaviours are enacted.PSYCHOSOCIAL DIMENSIONS INFLUENCING ADHERENCE\nIn addition to the contextual dimensions discussed above, our analysis also revealed a\nnumber of psychosocial dimensions influencing ART adherence. However, the\npsychosocial dimensions that influence ART adherence appear to be intertwined with\nthe contextual dimensions discussed above. In this section, we explore different forms\nof behaviour influencing ART adherence but argue that they are enabled or limited by\nthe context. As Table 3 illustrates, we have identified three broad psychosocial\ndimensions to influence ART adherence. The first relates to patients motivation for\ntaking ARVs. If a context allows a patient to readily access ART and the patient\nexperiences improved health, the patient may feel motivated to carefully adhere to theCopyright \u00a9 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The second dimension refers to patients\u2019 interest or ability to participate in their\ntreatment by engaging in activities that are conducive for their treatment. The third and\nfinal dimension relates to patients\u2019 psychosocial responses to ART. Depending on the\ncontext and the levels of support available, patients may engage in health\u2010damaging\nactivities, such as drinking alcohol, in an attempt to avoid their reality. Others may be\nable to construct positive social identities. We will now discuss the psychosocial\ndimensions in more detail, following the structure illustrated in Table 3.\nPatient motivation\nHow patients experience the physiological impact of ART differs\u2014conditioned by\ntheir local context\u2014and impacts their motivation for taking drugs. This can either\nfacilitate (if patients experience improvements) or undermine (if patients suffer from\nrepeated side effects) ART adherence.Table 3.

Both nurses and patients frequently spoke about the positive\nimpact that ART had on health and well\u2010being of ARV users. ART has enable many\npatients from being weak and bedridden to being fit and productive\u2014a change in\nhealth which motivates many to adhere.\n\u2018I feel motivated by the mere fact that before I was on ART I was always sick\nand was unable to do a lot of chores but since I started taking these drugs I am\nfit again.\u2019 Lucy, patient\nOne very visible change that ART can bring about is the weight gain of patients.\nIn this context, looking sickly thin is associated with AIDS, and because ART can\nfacilitate weigh gains, patients who were previously perceived as sick (and subject\nto stigma) now look healthy and well. The weight gain that ART can facilitate\ntherefore influences ART adherence positively.\n\u2018Some of them might have been motivated by the recovery they have gained.\nEspecially those who have gained some weight think they might lose weight\nagain if they default.\u2019 Eddy, nurse\nHope and desires for life. Seeing improvements to health after being diagnosed with a\ndisease that is often associated with death gives patients hope and a new and more\npositive outlook on their lives and their futures.One nurse argues that the life\u2010prolonging\nopportunities that ART provide is a key reason to why some patients adhere to ART.\n\u2018Adherence is successful when patients are taking medication so that they can\nlive longer.\u2019 Marta, nurse\nAlso related are the reasons why patients have to live a long and healthy life.\nJanet, for example, knows that only by adhering to ART will she stay healthy\nenough to care for her children and see them grow up.\n\u2018My kids are still very young and I value my health because it\u2019s only when I am\nfit that I can look after my children. I still want to look after children, so I stick\nto what the doctor advises me to do. I keep all my review dates, and I check my\ndiary regularly so that I don\u2019t miss any review dates.\u2019 Janet, patient\nHabit and complacency. How patients experience ART changes with time\u2014\nchanges that may either facilitate or undermine ART adherence. As Natashia\nhighlights, many patients become used to their treatment regimen, and taking drugs\nbecomes a habit that they do not need reminding of.\n\u2018We get accustomed to the routine of taking those drugs\u2019 Natashia, patient\nOn the other hand, you have patients who, after experiencing positive changes\nto their health, become complacent and believe they have recovered from AIDS.\n\u2018I have also realized that there is also a problem with patients who would have\nbeen on ART for a long time and now feeling like they are recovered. I have\ndiscovered that they become reluctant and their rate of compliance also goes\ndown. May be they will be feeling that they have fully recovered and have\nbeen cured, so sometimes getting ill will help them to comply.\u2019 Esther, nurseCopyright \u00a9 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The extent to which ART improves health differs between\npeople. For a small minority, the healthmay deteriorate as a result of ART\u2014for example,\nthrough developing Steven\u2013Johnson syndrome (toxic epidermal necrolysis), which is a\nskin disease. But for the majority, discomfort arising from the physiological reactions to\nthe powerful drugs iswhatmakes somepatients decide to discontinue their drug regimen.\n\u2018I stopped taking ARVs because of the side effects. This is my 5th time trying\nthese ARVs. The first time, I was on ARVs, they worked well for 3weeks, but\nthen some painful reactions appeared\u2014burns started developing. That was\nwhen I stopped and was given some medication to deal with the reaction and\nwhen I was feeling better again they tried me again.\u2019 Marie, patient\nThe nurses reported that the negative side effects ofARTwere higher amongst patients\nwho had inadequate food. Although the side effects may only encourage patients to\ndiscontinue their treatment temporarily, it is such inconsistencies that cause drug\nresistance.\nPatient agency\nART does not improve health in a vacuum but reacts to the various contextual\ndimensions that facilitate adherence. Patients can therefore take an active and\nmediating role in ensuring that the context is conducive to ART adherence.\nDisclosing their need for treatment. One important psychosocial factor facilitating\nART adherence is the patients decision to disclose to others their HIV status and\nneed for ART. Patients who tell the people close to them about their status and\ntreatment regimen do not need to take their pills secretly\u2014something that can result\nin treatment defaults.\n\u2018There are some who still want to keep it secret that they are living with HIV.\nYes, it is their decision but such people might even default because they would\nbe trying to make sure they are not seen.\u2019 Vincent, nurse\nWe have previously discussed how telling those around you, for instance, family\nmembers or those whom they live with, can be an invaluable resource for ARV users as\nthey can provide encouragement and help remind the patients about taking the drugs\nand attend consultations.\nAbility to mobilise support. In the preceding paragraphs, we have discussed the\nimportance of social support. However, social support is not just something that is\nalways available for patients to draw on; it requires patients to negotiate and navigate\nthrough the kinds of support that are available. Patients therefore benefit from living in a\ncontext that allows them to actively mobilise and access social support. In our context,\nthis can be illustrated through the way in which support groups for ARV users are\nemerging\u2014often as a result of their initiative and active participation.\n\u2018HIV positive people here are organized and we have our support group. It is so\nencouraging to have an arrangement whereby we meet on regular basis as\npeople living with HIV\/AIDS.\u2019 Everline, patientCopyright \u00a9 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Int J Health Plann Mgmt 2011; 26: 296\u2013318.\nDOI: 10.1002\/hpm\n312 M. SKOVDAL ET AL.In these support groups, ARV users share their knowledge and skills on activities\nthat help them cope with the challenges to ART adherence. This includes sharing\nknowledge about the IGAs they do.\nEngage in income\u2010generating activities. Patients\u2019 engagement in IGAs signifies a\nnumber of important factors that influence ART adherence. Firstly, patients are able to\nengage in IGAs because of the improvements in health they have experienced as a result\nof ART. Secondly, IGAs provide ARV users with a platform to prove their productivity\nand worth to society and to develop a positive approach to being HIV positive. Finally,\nthe IGAs allow the patients to grow healthy and nutritious foods\u2014all of which facilitate\nART adherence.\n\u2018MyHIV positive status gaveme the inspiration to start participating inHIV\/AIDS\nprogrammes, and I developed this positive approach, and I decided to start some\nincome generating projects. I remember I started a poultry project and vegetable\ngarden at our rural homewhich is near here. I grow carrots and have some chicken.\nI do this for myself so that I can eat healthy food. All these projects I started them\nafter realizing that I am HIV positive and I would need a good diet and a little\nincome.\u2019 Tonderai, nurse\nThis subsection has highlighted the role patients can play in optimising the outcomes\nof their treatment. This suggests that ART\u2010enabling contexts must be conducive and\nsupportive of the kind of activities and participation that facilitate ART adherence.\nPsychosocial responses to antiretroviral therapy\nIn this final subsection, we will explore how different patients respond psychologically\nto their HIV status and need of treatment.\nDrinking alcohol to avoid reality. A challenge particular to men in this context is the\nlocal constructions of masculinity, which makes it difficult for men to accept their HIV\nstatus and need for treatment. Many men fear that being HIV positive will reduce their\nmanhood and status and therefore often resort to alcohol to avoid a reality where they\nsee themselves to have a lesser role and purpose.\n\u2018It is common with men\u2026 adherence is hard to achieve for men because of\nalcoholism. Some men will drink so much that they forget to take their drugs,\nand even forget that they are patients on ART.\u2019 Colin, nurse\nAlthough many of our male participants reported on masculinity as a barrier to ART\nadherence, often with reference to alcohol use, they themselves had overcome these\nbarriers\u2014suggesting that far from all men struggle to come to terms with their HIV\nstatus and need to adhere to ART.\nSpiritual advice and traditional healers. Some patients resort to the spiritual world\nfor advice and to give meaning to changes in their lives. Although some churches are\nunhelpful in providing support to ART users, many patients still look towards faith to\nfind encouragement and meaning to difficult circumstances\u2014providing them with\npositive attitudes and outlook on life, which can facilitate ART adherence.Copyright \u00a9 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Such patients, as one nurse illustrates, are more likely to periodically\ndiscontinue their treatment\u2014presenting a barrier to ART treatment.\n\u2018This one ART patient of mine decided to consult a traditional healer, when she\ngot there she was told that she was not HIV positive and she should stop taking\nthose ARVs and was given some concoction, that she was told would cure her\nillness all together. So she stopped coming here, and when she came here she\nhad deteriorated so much.\u2019 Esther, nurse\nConstructing empowering social identities. The availability of ART has provided\nsome patients with a renewed and empowering identity\u2014one that draws on the\nhealth gains they have experienced as a result of ART, which translates AIDS from a\ndeath sentence to a chronic and manageable disease. Through an \u2018us and them\u2019\ndistinction, a number of ARV users highlighted themselves as responsible citizens\nwho are now worthy of respect from \u2018the other\u2019.\n\u2018Now people with HIV are able to feel like any other fit person\u2026 these drugs have\nremoved signs and symptoms of HIV and made us healthy again, gaining the\nrespect of other people in the community who would have condemned us to death.\nIt has made us fit again, as you might as well know we could have died or been\nbedridden by now. The drugs have brought life and restored dignity to us. People\nno longer look down upon us that much.\u2019 Pamela, patient\nThis subsection has explored some of the representations and the meanings that\nARV users draw on as a response to their ART treatment. Depending on the\nindividual patient, these representations and meanings can facilitate or undermine\ntheir adherence to ART and are worthy of our attention.\nDISCUSSION\nA great number of studies have explored the structural and behavioural barriers and\nfacilitators to successful ART adherence. They have provided us with very useful\nsnapshots of the determinants of successful treatment compliance in various contexts.\nMany of the barriers or the facilitators we refer to here have been identified in other\ncontexts. These include lack of adequate food, transport costs, waiting times, side\neffects and fear of stigma (Mshana et al., 2006; Hardon et al., 2007; Murray et al.,\n2009) as well as the role of alcohol, family members and treatment partners, social\nsupport and personal motivation to treatment (Dahab et al., 2008). However, our\nanalysis has revealed the existence of several additional factors including the role of\npatient\/nurse relationships as well as gendered positions in facilitating or undermining\nART adherence. We are reporting on these factors in greater detail elsewhere\n(Campbell et al., 2011a, Skovdal et al., in press, Skovdal et al., 2011).Copyright \u00a9 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Int J Health Plann Mgmt 2011; 26: 296\u2013318.\nDOI: 10.1002\/hpm\n314 M. SKOVDAL ET AL.Rather than providing another study highlighting a limited area of factors\ninfluencing ART, we have in this paper, as the first of its kind in Zimbabwe,\npresented a broad spectrum of barriers and facilitators to ART adherence, all of\nwhich can tell us a great deal about how we can improve compliance to AIDS\ntreatments. Informed by \u2018the health\u2010enabling social environment\u2019 model, we have\nhighlighted the networks and the relationships between some of the most prevalent\ninfluences to ART adherence in our case study. We did this with the aim to develop\na framework that can assist with the analysis, planning and execution of ART\nprogrammes in other African contexts. As detailed by the structure of our discussion\nof findings, the framework we have developed consists of four contextual and three\npsychosocial dimensions. Table 4 summarises our proposed analytical framework.\nThrough this framework, we propose that attention should be given to the\ncontextual and psychosocial dimensions that can influence successful compliance to\ntreatment. We thereby provide ART programme planners and implementers with a\ntool that encourages them to analyse the content of each of the seven dimensions\noutlined in Table 4. The content of the contextual and psychosocial dimensions will\ndiffer between socio\u2010economic and cultural settings; however, our study, and the\nnumerous other studies that have looked at ART adherence in Africa, provided\nuseful pointers towards what the content of the seven factors that we have identified\nto influence ART adherence might be.\nIn our case study, thematerial context refers to how poverty and sources of economic\nand materialistic support influence patients\u2019 ability to adhere to ART. In our study, this\ntranslated into lack of food and difficulties meeting the costs associated with treatment.\nIn agreement with a recommendationmade by Adato and Bassett (2008), these findings\nsuggest that there is an urgent need to include ARV users in social protection schemes\nsuch as food and cash transfers. The symbolic context highlights some of the meanings\nand the representations that flourish in a given context and influence ART adherence.\nAlthough we found that widespread and improved knowledge of AIDS (highlighting\nthe importance of information) has diminished the role of traditional healers, gendered\nstereotypes and fear of stigma still undermined ART adherence of men in particular.\nThese findings have highlighted the importance of creating social spaces that can\nchallenge and strengthenmeanings and representations in such away that patients begin\nto ascribe positive value and meaning to otherwise difficult circumstances (Goudge\net al., 2009; Campbell et al., 2011b). The relational context refers to social relations,\nboth within and between families, community groups and organisations. Although this\nmay also include forms of leadership, our case study was limited in scope to only\ninclude the relations between the patient and his or her social environment, including\nfamily and community members and nurses at the hospital. The influence of social\nrelations on ART adherence was the focus of a study by Ware et al. (2009) who argue\nthat social relations can explain the favourable ART adherence rates found in Africa.\nNeedless to say, the institutional context plays a fundamental role, particularly when it\ncomes to the availability and the quality of health services. Numerous studies have\nexplored how the quality of health services influence ART uptake and adherence\n(McCoy et al., 2005; Kip et al., 2009; Nsigaye et al., 2009). However, as illustrated\nfrom our case study, other institutional actors that may influence compliance to AIDS\ntreatment include NGOs and churches.

What motivates patients to (dis)continue taking\nmedication differs and happens at a reflexive and non\u2010reflexive level. At the reflexive\nlevel, patients are motivated by seeing improvements to their health (value of\ntreatment) and how this positively impacts on their role as wives, husbands or parents.\nOn the other hand, patients may be demotivated by the side effects that may arise as a\nresult of the medication. At a non\u2010reflexive level, patients may get into a habit of taking\ntheir medication, or they may be complacent and thereby discontinue taking their\nmedication. Patient participation highlights the different initiatives that patients\nengage in, in interaction with their local context, to achieve optimal health outcomes.\nSuch initiatives include disclosing their status and need for the ART as well as their\nparticipation in support groups and income\u2010generating projects. Although the need for\nARV users to disclose their HIV status has been discussed elsewhere (Sanjobo et al.,\n2008), little attention has been given to the active participation of patients in sustaining\ntheir treatment. In a forthcoming study, we discuss how patients negotiate a \u2018good\npatient\u2019 persona in order to achieve the best possible care from nurses (Campbell et al.,\n2011a). The final psychosocial dimension of this framework refers to the patient\u2019s\npsychosocial responses to ART and involves the different ways in which patients react\nand respond psychologically to the treatment regimen. Again, we found the patients to\nrespond differently. Some patients, particularly men, sought to avoid the perceived\ngrim reality of having lost their manhood to AIDS, repeatedly reminded to them by\ntheir daily drugs, by excessive drinking of alcohol. On the other hand, men and women\nwere found, through social spaces and with each other\u2019s help, to have developed new\nand empowering identities that help them give meaning and purpose to life.\nSeveral potential limitations of this study exist. The framework we have presented in\nthis paper is by nomeans complete, and we encourage other researchers to both exploreCopyright \u00a9 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We are also not saying that the content of the dimensions will be\nthe same in every context. Given that our data were collected mainly in rural areas\nof eastern Zimbabwe with Shona\u2010speaking participants, we concur with Flyvbjerg\n(2001) that the generalisability of findings to other locations should be established\non a case by case basis. Nevertheless, although the content of the dimensions\npresented in this paper will differ between contexts, we believe that the framework\nprovides a useful starting point for programme planners to examine the influences\nthat may compromise or facilitate successful compliance to ART in any resource\u2010\npoor context.CONCLUSION\nIn summary, this study has reported on some of the more prevalent barriers and\nfacilitators to ART adherence in Zimbabwe and classified them into a framework\nthat is transferrable for the analysis and action of ART programmes elsewhere. The\nframework argues that ART programme planners and implementers need to pay\nattention to four contextual (material, symbolic, relational and institutional) and\nthree psychosocial (patient motivation, patient participation and psychosocial\nresponses to ART) dimensions in their analysis of factors that may facilitate or\nundermine successful compliance to AIDS treatment in Africa.\nREFERENCESAdato M, Bassett L. 2008.
