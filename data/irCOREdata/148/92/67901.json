This paper makes the counterfactual assumption that private ownership of cars was severely restricted at the start of the twentieth century, and uses a range of historical data to examine the ways in which such a scenario might have impacted on transport infrastructure, personal mobility and urban life. It is argued that, even without the wholesale adoption of the motor car as a means of personal transport, patterns of everyday mobility would not have differed significantly from today so long as other forms of transport had remained or expanded to cope with this demand.

Although there is \nincreasing recognition of the environmental and congestion problems created by car use,\n1\n \nall transport policy in Britain assumes that access to a car is the norm for most people and \nthat intervention and regulation should do little more than mediate its impacts.\n2\n This is \nreflected in the number of currently-licensed vehicles (approximately 34 million licensed \nvehicles and 43 million licensed drivers) in the UK,\n3\n and since the inception of vehicle \nlicensing in Britain in 1903 there has been a steady year-on-year increase in the number \nof newly-registered vehicles\n4\n. It can be argued that although in 1956 there were still only \n6.3 million licensed vehicles in the UK, from at least the mid twentieth century the motor \ncar has had a major impact on the British landscape, economy and culture. Indeed, it has \nbeen argued that ever since the invention of the internal combustion engine there has \nbeen a form of \u2018path dependency\u2019 that has led to the almost inevitable domination of \nmodern transport by the motor car, and by the business interests that promote it, to create \npresent-day cultures of automobility\n5\n  \n \nBut imagine a different scenario. Following development of the internal combustion \nengine and its application to moving vehicles in the 1870s, and the steady growth of \nmotor vehicles in Britain to the first decade of the twentieth century (there were 17,000 \nlicensed motor vehicles in the UK in 1903), let us assume that in about 1910 a decision \nwas taken by government in Britain to prohibit the private ownership of motor vehicles. \nThe technical development of engines and vehicles would have continued, but was \n 5 \napplied to public transport, emergency vehicles, a limited number of registered delivery \nvehicles, licensed taxis and a small number of vehicles owned by elite individuals who \nwould have been driven by strictly-regulated professional drivers. The roads of Britain \nwould thus have been largely free of motor traffic, and private ownership of a motor \nvehicle would not have been an option for most people in Britain. This paper takes this \nstarting point, and examines the ways in which some aspects of British landscape, \neconomy and society might have developed differently if the private motor vehicle had \nbeen largely absent. Many themes could be explored, but attention is focused on three \nkey areas: first, development of the transport infrastructure in Britain; second, patterns of \nindividual mobility; and third the nature of urban life encompassing changes in aspects of \nurban structure, health and the environment. Where possible evidence to back up the \nassumptions made and scenarios built is drawn from historical research on travel and \ntransport in Britain, especially the author\u2019s own research on everyday mobility in the \ntwentieth century.\n6\n \n \nThe research that is used to substantiate arguments made in this paper was not originally \nintended for counterfactual purposes. The data seek to chart changes in everyday mobility \nin Britain over the twentieth century, and have been used to provide historical context to \ncontemporary debates about mobility change.\n7\n However, in thinking about the links \nbetween the past and the present, it became increasingly obvious that if an understanding \nof past mobility was used to construct a counterfactual argument about mobility change \nin Britain, then this may also contribute to contemporary debates about sustainable \ntransport futures in the UK. Thus, the paper attempts to use a counterfactual analysis of \n 6 \nhistorical evidence to construct an argument that is relevant to contemporary transport \npolicy. \n \nPlausible Worlds \nCounterfactual histories are contentious and the arguments for and against their use are \nwell rehearsed\n8\n. These are not repeated in this paper. Attempts at counterfactual analysis \nmost often focus on military or political history\n9\n with fewer attempts at counterfactual \nsocial, economic or cultural history\n10\n. This paper adds to the latter canon of work, though \nthis is not without difficulty. Whereas most counterfactuals focus on a single event such \nas the outcome of an election or battle (which have a limited range of implications), \ncounterfactuals of socio-cultural change necessarily embrace many different parameters \nand may have complex and multiple outcomes.\n11\n Such complexity increases the \nuncertainty of any predictions. Perhaps the most important starting point for any \ncounterfactual analysis is to pose the question: could the alternative scenario actually \nhave happened? Or to put it another way, is the analysis an exercise in imagination that is \ndevoid of reality, or does it provide a plausible alternative path that might in different \ncircumstances have been taken? In the context of this paper the key question to pose is \nwhether private motor vehicles could have been banned in Britain in the early twentieth \ncentury? This question can be approached from a number of different perspectives. \n \nThere was undoubted concern in late nineteenth-century Britain about the introduction of \nself-propelled traffic onto the roads.\n12\n The first Locomotive Act of 1861 specified that \n\u2018locomotives not drawing a carriage should have the tires of their wheels not less than \n 7 \n3in wide. They were to consume their own smoke, to have two drivers, the speed would \nnot exceed 10 miles an hour, and all rights of treating them as nuisance were carefully \npreserved\u2019.13 In 1863 the number of persons required to manage locomotives was \nincreased to three (with vehicles preceded by a pedestrian with a red flag) and the speed \nlimit was reduced to four miles an hour (two mph in cities, towns and villages).\n14\n It was \nargued at the time that these restrictions severely curtailed the development of the light \nroad locomotive industry in Britain.\n15\n Following a Parliamentary enquiry and effective \nlobbying from automobile enthusiasts, in 1896 the speed limit was raised to 12 mph and \nagain to 20 mph in 1903. However, sensitivity about the impact of self-propelled \nlocomotives on the roads continued as motor enthusiasts carefully stressed the law-\nabiding and safe nature of their passion. Thus in 1900 the Automobile Club of Great \nBritain organised a \u20181000 mile trial of motor vehicles\u2019 in part to overcome the views of \nthose who \u2018think that no advantage is to be gained by further progress in the use of motor \nvehicles in England\u2019.16 Over 80 vehicles took part in the eleven-day \u2018trial\u2019 which \nincluded gruelling hill climb sections and which passed through many of the major \npopulation centres of Britain, with exhibitions of cars in each of the towns visited. The \norganisers stressed that \u2018every possible precaution has been taken by the club in framing \nthe rules to prevent the trial from being a source of danger and annoyance to the public. \nIt must be clearly understood that the trial is a test of endurance, not a race. Hence the \njudges \u2026 will not have regard to any record in excess of the legal limit of speed. The \nspeed in passing through towns and villages is to be strictly limited to eight miles an \nhour. Of the any possible infringements of the rules which render competitors liable to \nthe disqualification of their vehicles, that of failing to show consideration to the drivers \n 8 \nof restless horses, is one of those upon which most stress is laid\u2019.17 It can thus be argued \nthat if the pro-car lobby had been less successful, much stricter conditions could have \nbeen imposed on road traffic in Britain.  \n \nIn fact, regulation in the twentieth century has been minimal. The 1903 Motor Car Act \nrequired all cars to be registered with the county or borough council in which the driver \nwas resident, and for the registration number to be displayed; drivers of motor vehicles \nmust have a licence (given by the local council for the payment of five shillings), but \nthere was no test of driver competence though a new crime of \u2018reckless driving\u2019 was \nintroduced to the statute books.\n18\n In 1930 all speed limits for vehicles carrying less than \nseven people were abolished but, following increased concern about rising road \ncasualties, in 1934 a 30 mph speed limit was introduced in built-up areas. However, other \nroads had no speed limit until 1965 when a national upper limit of 70 mph was \nintroduced for all roads (reduced to 60 mph on single carriageways in 1977).\n19\n The 1935 \nMotor Vehicles Regulation Act introduced a driving competency test for all individuals \nwho began driving after 1\nst\n Aril 1934 (suspended 1939-46 and again in 1956 during the \nSuez crisis) and in 1965 the DVLC was established to provide a national system of \nlicensing vehicles and drivers. Seat belts became compulsory from January 1983, but in \nmost other respects the private motorist remained relatively unregulated.\n20\n  \n \nDebates about road safety and the impact of motor vehicles on the roads were reasonably \nprominent, both nationally and locally, in the 1930s; but they often focused as much on \nimproving the roads for car use and on reducing congestion as on issues of safety and \n 9 \nregulation.\n21\n For instance, in 1929 the Royal Commission on Transport heard evidence \nfrom municipal and county engineers about the need for road widening to accommodate \nvehicles (suggesting a minimum width of 30 ft) and also the view that \u2018too many speed \nlimits reduced the effectiveness of the roads. The speed limits imposed in small towns and \nvillages in the early days of motor regulations now had the effect of congesting large \nquantities of traffic\u2019.22 There was recognition of the need to manage traffic more \neffectively in towns (with traffic lights introduced in most cities in the 1930s) while a \nstudy of 1933 painted a somewhat futuristic vision of urban traffic regulation that in \nmany respects is only being implemented in the 21\nst\n century. Henry Watson argued that \n\u2018In future the central areas of great cities will be closed to private vehicles of limited \nutility, as they are partly closed by parking restrictions today. Traffic signs and signals \nwill be of increasing complexity. Traffic movements will be watched from headquarters \nby automatic vehicle counters, television and auto-gyros, and locally from roof-high \ncontrol bridges spanning the streets, whilst constables will receive their instructions \nthrough portable radio sets\u2019.23  \n \nRoad casualties emerged as a national issue in 1934 when the Minister of Transport, \nOliver Stanley, introduced a new road safety campaign with a national radio broadcast on \nthe eve of the Easter holidays. He predicted 100 road fatalities over the Easter weekend \nand pleaded for care and responsible behaviour by all road users, whilst stressing that the \nmotor car was very much a permanent fixture of Britain\u2019s roads and that responsibility \nfor road safety lay primarily with road users rather than through regulation (whilst \nimplying that regulation may have been possible in the past): \u2018Only the co-operation of \n 10 \nevery user of the road - motorist, cyclist and pedestrian \u2013 only their caution, their care \nand their courtesy could make the roads really safe. It was no good arguing which had \nthe better right to the roads \u2013 motorists or pedestrians. They were both on the roads and \nthey were going to stay there. Years ago when motoring was the privilege of the peer or \nthe plutocrat, it might have been possible to resist what was only the luxury of the few. \nBut today the luxury of the few had become the necessity of the many\u2019.24 Although today \nBritain has some of the lowest road casualty figures in Europe, and rates are continuing to \nfall, none-the-less on average some eight or nine people per day are killed on the roads, \nwith over 87 per day killed or seriously injured.\n25\n Moreover, while improvements in \nvehicle safety have increasingly insulated the motorist, casualties have fallen \ndisproportionately on pedestrians, cyclists and motor cyclists. It can be argued that if an \nannual death toll of some 3000 fit and healthy people occurred due to any other cause \nthere would be a public outcry, with vehement calls for regulation.\n26\n For instance, if a \nnew and widely used life-style drug was found to kill 3000 users a year it would almost \ncertainly be immediately banned. The fact that this annual death toll passes almost \nunnoticed demonstrates the power that the motor industry has achieved, and the degree of \ncar dependency in modern society.\n27\n However, from another perspective, if in 1900 it had \nbeen predicted that over half a million people\n28\n would be killed on Britain\u2019s roads over \nthe next century, then perhaps motor vehicles would have been more strongly regulated, \neven to the extent of banning most private cars. \n \n \n \n 11 \nTransport Infrastructure \nAll transport depends on the development of an appropriate infrastructure, and one of the \nmain impacts of car use on the British landscape has been the development of the \nfacilities that support motoring: not only the road network itself but the signs and signals \nused to direct and control traffic, the petrol stations needed for refuelling vehicles and the \nservice areas required to refresh motorists.\n29\n In what ways would Britain\u2019s transport \ninfrastructure have been different if the private motor vehicle had been severely \nrestricted? Attention is focused on three aspects: the development of the motorway and \ntrunk road network in Britain; competition for road space between cars and other road \nusers in cites; and the impact of the motor vehicle on the British rail network.  \n \nBy the 1930s, with some three million licensed drivers in Britain, there was increasing \npressure to improve the trunk road network to enable cars to travel quickly and easily \nover long distances, avoiding congestion in major urban areas.\n30\n Thus in 1936 the \nInstitute of Highway Engineers published a plan for a network of motorways covering the \nentire country (from Dover to Glasgow and from Plymouth to Edinburgh): a network \nrather more dense than that actually achieved by the 21\nst\n century (Figure 1a), and in 1938 \nthe County Surveyors\u2019 Society published plans for a more skeletal network of 1000 miles \nof motorway (Figure 1b).\n31\n The urban and industrial region of north-west England \nprovides a case study of the early evolution of motorways and improved trunk roads. One \nof the key issues debated in the 1930s, and still relevant today, was the degree to which \nnew roads should be mixed use with frequent and easy access, or the extent to which new \nroads should be dedicated only to high-speed motor vehicles with limited access from \n 12 \nother routes. Lancashire County Council proposed improving the N-S route of the \nA6\/A49 with a high standard dual carriageway to include cycle tracks and footpaths \nthroughout its length. However, the county council was also becoming increasingly \nconcerned about the high accident rate that occurred on the new all-purpose Liverpool-\nEast Lancashire road that had been opened in 1934: this was ascribed to the mixed-use \nnature of the road and the frequent entry and exit points. Thus in 1937 the county council \nabandoned ideas for the A6\/A49 improvement and instead proposed an entirely new N-S \nroute with controlled access and restricted to motor traffic, in other words a motorway. A \nfurther influence on this move towards purpose-built high-speed roads restricted to motor \nvehicles (rather than mixed use routes) was the development of the German autobahn \nnetwork; in 1937 a delegation of 224 British MPs, highway engineers and others \ninspected the German system.\n32\n The impact of such visits also had local implications: for \ninstance the municipal surveyor for Blackpool (a member of the delegation) argued that a \nproposed ring road for the town should be built as a motorway. The Minister of \nTransport, Leslie Burgin, approved Lancashire\u2019s proposals for a new 62 mile N-S route \nand preliminary survey work was undertaken in the late 1930s. Most work on new road \ninfrastructure halted during the war, but in 1946 a new national road construction \nprogramme included both the N-S Lancashire route and an E-W Liverpool-Manchester-\nYorkshire route, and these were included in the 1947 Lancashire County Road Plan. The \nfirst section of the N-S route (the Preston bypass) was opened in December 1958 (the \nfirst stretch of motorway in the country) with the rest of the M6 through Lancashire built \nin stages and completed in 1965.\n33\n \n \n 13 \nIn the 1930s there was massive pressure for new road building dedicated to the motorcar, \nand the growth of motor traffic was a major factor in providing the infrastructure of \nmotorways that eventually emerged in Britain. However, in some ways it is remarkable \nhow slowly the motorway network evolved (with the network still rather less than that \nproposed in 1936). Never-the-less, it is clear that the private motor vehicle largely shaped \nthe nature and development of new road building for much of the twentieth century.\n34\n If \naccess to private motor vehicles had been restricted the road network today would clearly \nlook very different, and there would almost certainly be no motorways. However, there \nwould still have been pressures for road improvement. It is reasonable to assume that \nbuses (together with trains \u2013 see below \u2013 and possibly other more innovative forms of \npublic transport) would have been used extensively for travel between and within urban \nareas, and there would be the need to accommodate delivery vehicles in areas not \naccessible by rail, and also emergency and other licensed vehicles. It seems likely that \nwith respect to infrastructure, while the motorway network in Britain would probably not \nexist in a landscape without cars, there would have been substantial improvement of \nmixed use roads to accommodate buses, essential vehicles, cycles, and pedestrians. \nPerhaps Lancashire County Council\u2019s original proposals for an improved mixed-used \nA6\/A49 would have gone ahead, but there would have been much less need to by-pass \ntowns and, instead, it can be suggested that the major focus of road building and traffic \nmanagement would have been on linking settlements effectively for a variety of road \nusers, rather than on allowing one group (the motorist) to travel rapidly over long \ndistances avoiding urban centres.  \n \n 14 \nCompetition for road space between different forms of transport is especially acute within \nurban areas where, despite the development of some urban motorways, it is much more \ndifficult to segregate traffic. How would traffic management in large cities have been \ndifferent if access to private motor transport had been severely restricted? Again, it can \nbe argued that the period between the two World Wars was a key era of change. In terms \nof road construction, many of the debates rehearsed above with regard to the trunk road \nsystem were replicated in and around large urban areas. London provides the best \nexample. As early as 1905 the Royal Commission on London Traffic recommended the \ndevelopment of a circular road around London (roughly the route of the North and South \nCircular roads) but, due to the disaggregated nature of responsibility for transport \nplanning in London at this time, progress was slow with only short sections completed \nand linked in a somewhat haphazard fashion. However, by the 1930s a more-or-less \ncomplete inner orbital route had been established. In 1934 the Minister of Transport \n(Leslie Hore-Belisha) initiated a survey of traffic and highway developments in London \nand in 1937 Charles Bressey and Edward Lutyens produced their Highways Development \nSurvey. A key element of this was a proposal for an outer orbital road which, in part at \nleast, became the M25 in the 1970s.\n35\n As with the national motorway network, major new \nroad building in London was undoubtedly stimulated by the motorcar but, in some \nrespects, came remarkably slowly given the concerns generated in the early twentieth \ncentury. \n \nGiven the slow pace of new road construction, it is not surprising that much debate in the \ninter-war period focused on how the existing road network could be better used by the \n 15 \ntraffic of the time and, in particular, with competition between motor vehicles and other \nroad users. Such issues came to the fore in Manchester in the 1920s and \u201830s. In the \n1920s the tram network was the dominant form of public transport in the city and most \npeople, including many car owners, regularly used trams for their everyday travel. Thus \nin 1926 the Manchester tram network recorded some 318 million passenger journeys.\n36\n \nHowever, as in other cities the tram network attracted substantial criticism: it was seen as \nold fashioned and inappropriate for a modern city, with motor vehicles hailed as the \nsymbol of progressive modernity. Trams were accused of being inflexible and of causing \ncongestion by impeding other road users (especially motor vehicles); they were also \nregarded as expensive in that the travelling public had come to expect low tram fares but \nit was assumed they would pay more to travel on new motor buses.\n37\n Thus, in the 1930s, \nmotor buses increasingly replaced trams as public transport in Manchester, and those who \ncould afford to switched to the use of private motor transport, often stimulated by the \nargument that public transport had become less convenient or more expensive. Although \nthere were some attempts to regulate cars in the 1930s (for instance Manchester \nintroduced its first one-way system in 1936) the private motor car progressively came to \ndominate urban road space.  \n \nWould any of this have been different if the ownership of private vehicles had been \nrestricted? Obviously urban traffic congestion would have been less and the demand for \npublic transport (and possibly the use of cycles and walking for everyday transport) \ngreater, but competition between trams and motor buses would have been much the same. \nArguments against trams and in favour of motor buses were so strong that it can be \n 16 \nsuggested that the tram network would have disappeared from British cities regardless of \nthe presence of private motorists, and in most cities trams had all but disappeared before \nmass car use developed. However, it can be argued that if private motor transport had not \nbeen available, the decline in the use of urban public transport that occurred in most cities \nfrom the 1960s would not have taken place, bus provision would have remained high, and \nthat reinvestment in trams may have occurred earlier. These trends are all evident in \nLondon following the introduction of congestion charging,\n38\n and it is reasonable to \nsuppose that townscapes of the late twentieth century would have been dominated by \nmotor buses, trams, cycles and pedestrians. Although congestion would undoubtedly still \nhave occurred, it is likely that road space would have been more evenly allocated \nbetween different road users. \n \nPrior to the expansion of the private motor vehicle, most people made long-distance trips \nby train. Many of course still do, but over the twentieth century the British rail system \nshrank from a dense network that penetrated most parts of the country to a more skeletal \nsystem primarily serving major cities and suburban commuters (especially in the SE) \n(Figures 2a and 2b). The crucial period for the decline of the railway network was the \n1960s when the 1963 \u2018 Beeching Report\u2019 on the \u2018reshaping of British railways\u2019 argued \nthat in many parts of the country railway provision was now not viable, and could not \ncompete with growing car use. This led to the closure of some 5000 miles of track and \nthe loss of 2000 stations.\n39\n Many rural areas were left without ready access to the rail \nnetwork. If car ownership had been restricted it is reasonable to assume that the Beeching \ncuts  would have been less severe (focused on over-supply of competing routes rather \n 17 \nthan removing links from the network), that demand for rail travel even in rural areas \nwould have remained high, and that the dense railway network of 1900 would have been \nmaintained, or even extended, for both passenger and freight traffic.\n40\n This is one way in \nwhich the landscape of Britain would have been very different, with arguably much \ngreater investment than has occurred so far in high speed trains and new roiling stock.\n41\n \nIn this sense the rail network of c1900 (Figure 2a) can be viewed as a counterfactual map \nof the British rail network in the 21\nst\n century if the scenario outlined at the start of this \npaper had taken place. \n \nPersonal mobility \nGiven the transport infrastructure scenario outlined above, what difference might the lack \nof access to private motor vehicles have made to personal mobility? It is argued that two \nkey points are crucial. First, many people travelled freely over long distances before the \ndevelopment of mass car ownership, and a significant minority of people today choose \nnot to own a car and manage to travel easily over long distances despite the denuded \nBritish transport system. Second, most everyday travel undertaken by individuals in \nBritain is over a relatively short distance, often less than two km, and for such trips other \nforms of transport can readily be substituted for the motor car (indeed, a car may not be \nthe quickest or most effective means of transport for many such journeys in large urban \nareas). Thus it is argued that, assuming the maintenance of a high quality and dense \npublic transport network, restricted car access would have had only a limited impact on \npersonal mobility over the twentieth century. Evidence to support these assertions is \n 18 \ndrawn from recent research on everyday mobility in Britain over the twentieth century \n(Pooley, Turnbull and Adams 2005), with only the briefest summary presented here.\n42\n \n \nThere have been significant changes in the journey to work in Britain over the twentieth \ncentury, with the mean distance travelled to work (males and females) increasing from \naround 4 km in 1900 (with about half of all trips on foot) to just under 15 km in the 1990s \n(with fewer than ten per cent of trips on foot and 50 per cent by car). However, the time \nspent travelling to work has increased much less. By the 1920s the mean time taken to \ntravel to work was 30 minutes and in the 1990s this had increased slightly to 35 minutes. \nIt is argued, and supported by research elsewhere,\n43\n that travel time is far more important \nthan distance, and that the motor car has allowed people to travel further but has not in \nother respects changed travel-to-work patterns. Moreover where public transport \nprovision is good, most notably in London, car use has remained at a low level for the \njourney to work.\n44\n Thus, it can be suggested that if access to private motor vehicles had \nbeen restricted the time spent travelling to work would have changed little, and the \ndistance over which people travelled would depend primarily on the effectiveness of the \npublic transport system. A good tram or bus network in an urban area can enable a \ncommuter to travel as far in 30-40 minutes as they could by car; however, in smaller \nsettlements with poorer public transport, it is likely that travel-to-work distances would \nhave been significantly less than they are today. Some people, at least, would have had to \nlive much closer to their place of work and the ability to consider trading commuting for \nresidential relocation would have been curtailed. \n \n 19 \nEvidence from an analysis of the everyday travel of children aged 10\/11 from the 1940s \nto the present suggests that there has been even less change in personal mobility over the \npast 50 years (the era during which access to motor vehicles has grown most steeply). For \nchildren of this age the main trips undertaken include travel to school, to visit friends for \nplay, to go shopping (both alone and with parents) and outings with other family \nmembers. From the 1940s to the present, in urban areas at least, the majority of such \njourneys are relatively short and do not necessitate use of a car. Thus in Manchester in \nthe 1940s children aged 10\/11 travelled on average some 3,500 km in a year, with the \naverage trip distance just 1.3 km. By the start of the 21\nst\n century, children of the same age \nin Manchester travelled further in total (some 4500 km) but the average trip distance \nremained very low at 1.5 km. If we focus on the most common event \u2013 the journey to \nschool \u2013 in the 1940s in Manchester the mean distance for children aged 10\/11 was 1.3 \nkm and in 2000 the mean distance was 1.4 km. There is thus convincing evidence that \ndespite the widespread use of the car during the second half of the twentieth century, \nmost everyday travel for children living in a city such as Manchester remained short \ndistance. Given that many of these trips were accompanied by an adult (around 80 per \ncent in both time periods), such short trips were also an important component of the lives \nof many parents. Data for the much smaller town of Lancaster show very similar trends, \nthough for those living in remoter rural areas there is evidence of a greater increase in \neveryday travel as more services have become concentrated in towns.\n45\n Although car use \nhas obviously increased over the past half century, in 2000 in Manchester almost 65 per \ncent of all trips by children aged 10\/11 were on foot (88 per cent in the 1940s); \nqualitative evidence suggests that the main reasons for using a car relate to convenience \n 20 \nand the need to link the trip with other activities, rather than the distance covered for a \nspecific activity such as travel to school. It can thus be argued that the widespread \nadoption of the motor car has had surprisingly little impact on the everyday mobility of \nchildren and their parents and that, if car use had been restricted, patterns of individual \neveryday mobility would have remained much the same.  \n \nFor most people longer distance trips (for instance to visit relatives or for leisure) are still \nrelatively rare events and, although access to a car may make such trips more convenient, \nthey were perfectly possible in the period before mass car ownership. Moreover, the \nmean distance travelled by children for activities such as holidays, social occasions or \nsporting events has also varied little over the past half century. Thus there is no reason to \nsuggest that even such longer-distance journeys would have been significantly different \nin a landscape without cars. Perhaps the group that has seen most change in their mobility \nover the past half century are the relatively elderly. In the 1940s many people in their 60s \nwere considered old and\/or infirm and would have travelled little beyond their immediate \nneighbourhood. Today most people of the same age can travel widely. Indeed several \nelderly respondents in c2000 suggested that they had more mobility in their 60s than at \nany other time in their lives.\n46\n However, this increased mobility has little to do with the \navailability of motor transport. Primarily it is a reflection of improved health, increased \nleisure time following retirement, and surplus income. Some older people do drive but \nmany prefer not to, and discounted fares on trains and buses encourage those over 60 to \nuse public transport. It can be suggested that the elderly have experienced significant \n 21 \nmobility change over the past century, but that it would have been much the same with or \nwithout the motorcar. \n \nAlthough in terms of personal mobility the impact of the motor car is much less than \nmight be expected, it is likely that restrictions on private car use would have produced \nmore subtle behavioural changes. Thus it is likely that people would undertake fewer \ntrivial journeys, that they would plan their activities more carefully, combining several \nactivities at the same location in one outing rather than popping out repeatedly in the car \n(especially in rural areas), but that they would be less likely to link together several \nactivities in different locations because complex cross-town journeys would be more \ndifficult. It can be suggested that some women could be more affected than men by such \ndifferences. Although women have mostly used cars less than men, the demands of \nchildcare and housekeeping \u2013 when combined with paid employment \u2013 mean that women \noften have much more complex journeys than men (who are more likely to travel directly \nfrom home to work and back again). As gender differences in access to cars have \ndeclined, the car has allowed many women to combine multiple roles more effectively.\n47\n \nIt can also be hypothesised that without access to a car travel would be qualitatively \ndifferent. Thus everyday journeys may have remained much more communal and \nsociable activities, as people were required to interact on public transport, possibly \nleading to greater community cohesion. The experience of travel, and the use of travel \ntime, may also have been different for many people if they used less personalised modes \nof transport than the car.\n48\n However, historically, it can also be shown that those able to \ncontrol their travelling environment have always done so, and thus any impact may have \n 22 \nbeen small.\n49\n Such behavioural changes, which reflect the ways in which most people \nmanaged their mobility in the early twentieth century, would not fundamentally alter \noverall patterns of mobility today, but life styles, expectations and the experiences of \ntravel that have been built around access to the car would require adjustments.  \n \nUrban Life \nCities can be viewed as organic: their shape, size and structure reflect the lifestyles of \ntheir inhabitants and the urban infrastructure. Personal mobility and transport \ninfrastructures both play an important part in shaping the city and in turn reflect urban \nstructure. Spatial expansion and suburbanisation are characteristic of twentieth-century \nBritish cities, and it might be assumed that suburban sprawl was dependent on the \navailability of the motor car, and that in a landscape without cars cities would be both \nhigh density and compact to facilitate movement between different activities. However, \nthere is little direct evidence to suggest that the motor car caused suburbanisation or that \nthe lack of access to a car prevents urban sprawl.  \n \nSubstantial suburbanisation in large British cities began in the second half of the \nnineteenth century, long before the development of the motor car as a form of mass \ntransport. At that time it occurred largely independently of transport developments: \nrailways mostly followed suburban development, and the affluent who suburbanised \ncould afford the journey into town by existing means (horse-drawn omnibus, tram or \nprivate carriage).\n50\n A second phase of suburbanisation occurred in the 1920s and \u201830s as \nthose on lower incomes moved to newly\u2013built suburban private and social housing \n 23 \nestates. However, few of the houses built at this time were provided with a garage (or \nspace to build a garage) and the expectation was that people would travel easily from the \nsuburbs to the city by tram or motorbus.\n51\n There is evidence to suggest that, especially \nfrom the 1950s, the trend of decentralising employment from the city centre or \nconcentrated dockside locations to the urban periphery did encourage those who had \naccess to a car at that time to abandon public transport and use their car to make a more \ncomplex cross-city journey,\n52\n but the motor car did not cause this trend of economic \ndecentralisation (which had much more to do with changing industrial processes, \ndeindustrialisation and land prices), and the car was simply a convenient means of \ntransport at the time. Assuming that in a landscape without cars public transport would \nhave evolved to reflect a new urban structure, then there is no reason why such trends \nshould have been different, though urban development from the 1950s may have been \nmore dense as almost all houses would have been built without garages and parking \nspaces. \n \nGiven that most people seek to minimise travel time and distance, it is likely that other \naspects of urban structure may have been different if access to private motor transport \nhad been restricted. In the 1950s, when most people still did not have access to a car, \nthere was much better provision of neighbourhood facilities including shops, schools and \nsocial activities. One of the key trends of the late twentieth century has been the closure \nof local facilities and the concentration of services (especially retailing) in large \nperipheral complexes. These are usually predicated on the assumption that people have \naccess by car.\n53\n If car use had been severely restricted it seems likely that the growth of \n 24 \nout-of-town shopping complexes would also have been much less, with provision of good \npublic transport to those that were developed, but also the retention of far more \nneighbourhood facilities. Lack of access to a car would probably also have restricted the \nextent of counterurbanization that occurred in Britain from the 1960s.\n54\n Although some \nsmaller towns with good transport connections would probably still have grown, \ndevelopments in more remote locations would probably have been curtailed. Overall, it \ncan again be suggested that restricted access to the private motor car would have made \nmuch less difference to urban structure and the way in which people lived their everyday \nlife than might at first be anticipated. \n \nIn contrast, it can be argued that a landscape without cars would produce a much cleaner \nurban environment and, potentially, a more healthy urban population. Following the \nimpacts of deindustrialisation (which led to the closure of much potentially polluting \nindustry) and the enforcement of the Clean Air Act in 1956 (which regulated both \ndomestic and industrial smoke emissions in urban areas), the vast majority of air-borne \npollutants in towns and cities in Britain have been generated by motor vehicles. For \ninstance, it is estimated that in the UK on average over 50 per cent of nitrogen dioxide \nand 75 per cent of carbon monoxide is emitted by motor vehicles,\n55\n and there is clear \nevidence of the health effects of living near a main road.\n56\n Although some aspects of \ntwentieth-century urban planning have sought to minimise the impacts of cars on \npedestrians and cyclists (pedestrianisation, congestion charging, urban speed restrictions), \nthe total impact of such schemes has been limited.\n57\n An almost car-free city would have a \nmajor impact on the level of air pollution in urban areas, and would certainly make cities \n 25 \nmuch more pleasant places in which to live and walk. However, even without private \nmotor transport, an increased number of urban buses could have a significant impact on \npollution and, as early as the 1930s, the MoH in Salford was expressing concern about \nthe impact of diesel fumes.\n58\n A town full of diesel buses could be just as bad as one \ncongested with cars, and thus arguments to convert public transport to less polluting \ntechnology would not have been diminished.  \n \nIt is more difficult to ascertain the full impact of a town without cars on human health. \nWhile removal of cars would have created a cleaner environment, and potentially would \nhave improved human health, the combined effect of other lifestyle factors including diet, \nexercise, smoking and alcohol consumption arguably all have a much bigger influence on \nindividual health today.\n59\n Thus cleaner cities, though pleasant, may not make a \nsubstantial difference to individual health. It could also be suggested that in a society \nwithout access to the car, more people would walk and cycle in urban areas and that there \nwould thus be added health benefits due to increased exercise.\n60\n However, again the \nevidence is limited. High levels of exercise, including walking and cycling, are more \nclosely correlated with income and lifestyle than with car ownership. For instance, \naccording to 2001 census data the City of Lancaster has a high level of car ownership, but \nalso a high level of walking and cycling as a means of travelling to work. This is reflected \nin the fact that Lancaster was one of the first six towns in England identified as a \u2018cycling \ndemonstration town\u2019 by the DfT in 2005. In contrast, the city of Liverpool has a very low \nlevel of car ownership, but also has low levels of walking and cycling but very high bus \nuse. Thus lack of access to a car does not necessarily mean that people walk and cycle \n 26 \nmore, and beneficial impacts of restricted car access on exercise and health are likely to \nbe highly spatially variable and probably concentrated in those areas which already have \na good health record.\n61\n \n \nConclusions \nThis paper has argued that it is reasonable to imagine a landscape without cars in Britain \nand, that if access to private motor vehicles had been severely restricted at the start of the \ntwentieth century, the overall impacts on mobility, society and culture would have been \nmuch less than might be expected. The paper has not dealt directly with economic \nimplications, and obviously the impact on enterprises directly related to the automobile \nindustry would have been large. However, they would no doubt have developed in other \nways and, assuming a good freight transport system, there is no reason why either \nnational economic growth or personal economic security should have been greatly \naffected. Certainly the transport infrastructure in the country would look rather different, \nbut it is argued that patterns of mobility, work and everyday living would not be \nsignificantly different from what they are today, and that there would be only minor \ndifferences in urban structure and form. There would probably be the need to plan \njourneys more carefully, with less spontaneity than is assumed in the 21\nst\n century, but this \nwas the case in the 1930s and this did not stop people travelling. Environmental benefits \ncould be substantial, but it is argued that any direct impact on human health is much \nharder to ascertain. \n \n 27 \nA counterfactual argument such as this has many obvious limitations: three points are \nespecially important. First, it assumes that decisions taken within Britain could be made \nand sustained irrespective of what occurred elsewhere in the world. The emergence of a \nglobal economy in the twentieth century (and arguably earlier),\n62\n and especially the \nhegemony of the US economy \u2013 itself highly dependent on the motor industry63 - makes \nthis a highly unlikely scenario. However, it might also be argued that if the transport \nindustry in Britain (itself still a global power in the early twentieth century) had \ndeveloped sufficiently strongly, a non-car economy may have become a viable \nalternative. Second, any counterfactual analysis clearly has to make certain arbitrary \ndecisions about what to change and what to hold constant. The argument in this paper \nsimply assumes that private car use was severely restricted, and that alternative forms of \ntransport developed effectively. A different approach could make much more radical \nassumptions about changes in the social, economic, political and technological landscape \nof Britain. For instance, it could be argued that in the absence of the private car there \nwould have been new technological innovations in individualised mass transit, and that it \nhas been the dominance of the car that has inhibited such developments.\n64\n  \n \nWhile there would have been clear environmental benefits from a restriction on car use, \nand it is argued that everyday life in Britain would not necessarily have been \nfundamentally changed, it is important to consider what would also have been lost. Just \nas there are social and spatial inequalities associated with car use in 21\nst\n century Britain,\n65\n \nso too a landscape without cars would have raised issues of social justice with respect to \nmobility and accessibility. What is interesting, however, is that the groups and places \n 28 \nmost likely to be disadvantaged if car use had been restricted are broadly the same as \nthose that currently experience the most transport poverty. Thus, it can be suggested that \nit would become more problematic to live in some remote rural areas; that those with the \nnecessity to undertake complex multi-purpose trips (most often women) would \nexperience the most difficulty; that the poor (and the young) may be excluded from some \nforms of transport; and that those travelling at unsocial hours would have the most \ndifficulty. However, it can also be suggested that such differentials may well have been \nless than those experienced today as public transport would undoubtedly have been \nbetter, and the mobility-privileged would have been most affected by restrictions on \nprivate motorised transport. Third, as outlined earlier, social and cultural change is \ncomplex and multifaceted. This paper has posited one set of possible outcomes from an \nassumed set of actions. There may well have been many others.  \n \nAlthough it would certainly have been easier to impose restrictions on motor vehicles in \nthe 1900s than would be the case today, it can be suggested that a landscape without cars \n(or at least with very few motor vehicles) is still by no means implausible. Many people \neither choose not to use a car for environmental reasons or cannot afford to run a car \n(according to the 2001 census 27.4 per cent of households in the UK do not have access \nto a car); yet most of these will lead full and active lives even with the poor level of \npublic transport provision currently available. Some restrictions on car use have been \nimposed in many European cities, including London, Oslo and Copenhagen, and there is \nevidence that an increasing proportion of the population accept that there have to be \nrestrictions placed on car use for environmental reasons.\n66\n Although any large-scale \n 29 \nchange in Britain is unlikely to include the banning of car ownership, much greater \ninvestment in public transport linked to restrictions on car use do not seem impossible \noutcomes of current political debates.\n67\n This paper has demonstrated that lack of access to \na car would not have made a fundamental difference to the ways in which people lived \ntheir lives in Britain, and could bring major advantages, even with the technologies \navailable for much of the twentieth century. With the availability of new forms of \ncommunication and virtual mobility a landscape without cars would be even easier to \nmanage, though it would also present many challenges.\n68\n \n \n 30 \n \nFigure 1: (a) The Institution of Highway Engineers' plan for a network of motorways, published in 1936; (b) The County Surveyors' \nSociety plan for 1000 miles of motorway linking the main industrial centres in the Country, published in 1938.Source: The Motorway \nArchive: http:\/\/www.iht.org\/motorway\/page1.htm (accessed July 2007) \n 31 \n \nFigure 2: (a) The railway network in Britain c1900 (based on M.
