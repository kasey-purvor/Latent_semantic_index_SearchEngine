Using this 7 \nsystem, juvenile rainbow trout were exposed for one week to 4-tert-octylphenol (OP, 8 \n10-1000 \u00b5g\/L) with or without the presence of suspended sediments (10-20 mg\/L of 9 \nnatural suspended sediments from the River Calder, UK).  About 8 % of the added OP 10 \npartitioned to the solid phase.  Vitellogenin levels were determined in the plasma of 11 \nthe exposed rainbow trout and showed a dose-dependent increase with regards to OP 12 \nexposure concentration.  Considerable variation in the vitellogenin response was 13 \nobserved between separate runs with the same OP concentration.  There was no 14 \nstatistically significant (at P<0.05) difference in plasma VTG levels between the OP 15 \ntreatments with or without suspended sediments.  This suggests that the dissolved 16 \nconcentration is the key factor and natural suspended sediment neither protects 17 \nagainst, nor exacerbates, the endocrine disrupting effect of OP on fish. 18 \n 19 \nKeywords: alkylphenols; suspended sediments; rainbow trout; octylphenol; endocrine 20 \ndisrupters; partition coefficient 21 \n 22 \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n Page 3 of 27 \nIntroduction 1 \nMost experimental studies of endocrine disruption in aquatic organisms have involved 2 \nthe exposure of animals to single pure chemicals dissolved in water.  But in the real 3 \nworld, the aquatic environment consists not only of mixtures of chemicals, but also of 4 \na natural suspension of particles in the aqueous medium, at concentrations extending 5 \ninto the grams per litre range depending upon hydrological conditions (Wass and 6 \nLeeks, 1999).  Thus, there is the potential for suspended solids to modulate the effects 7 \nof endocrine disruptors on susceptible organisms.   8 \nAlthough, after the restrictions on the use of alkylphenol polyethoxylate surfactants in 9 \nthe EU and some other countries (Directive 2003\/53\/EC, 2003, Soares et al., 2008), 10 \nmuch of the focus on endocrine disrupting chemicals in the aquatic environment has 11 \nnow turned to the ubiquitous steroid estrogens (Desbrow et al., 1998, Sheahan et al., 12 \n2002a), there are still rivers where alkylphenols from the degradation of their 13 \nethoxylates play a significant role in particular with respect to estrogenic chemicals 14 \nassociated with solid matter (Fenet et al., 2003, Petrovic et al., 2002, Sheahan et al., 15 \n2002b).  It is frequently found that while estrogenic activity measured in the water 16 \nphase of sewage effluents, or receiving waters, is mostly caused by steroid estrogens, 17 \na large part of the estrogenicity extracted from solids, such as sediments and sewage 18 \nsludge can be explained by alkylphenols (Bolz et al., 2002, Fenet et al., 2003).  19 \nFurthermore, since in lakes with stratified sediment deposition, the highest NP 20 \nconcentrations were found in bed-sediments from the 70s or 80s (Giger and Alder, 21 \n2002, Isobe et al., 2001), re-suspension of historic bed-sediments may provide a 22 \nsecondary source of alkylphenol contaminated solids.  The most common akylphenols 23 \nnonylphenol and octylphenol have octanol water partitioning coefficients (Log Kow) in 24 \nthe range of 4-5 (Ahel and Giger, 1993, McLeese et al., 1981), which is somewhat 25 \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n Page 4 of 27 \nhigher than the steroid estrogens, which have Log Kow values between 2.5 and 4 1 \n(Hansch, 1995, Holthaus et al., 2002).  Furthermore, distribution coefficients (Kd) 2 \nobserved in the field are often higher than those measured in laboratory experiments 3 \nor predicted from log Kow data (Isobe et al., 2001, Patrolecco et al., 2006).   4 \nIn environmental samples, a significant proportion of alkylphenols may be bound to 5 \nsuspended sediments.  For example, in the Tokyo area Isobe et al (2001) found an 6 \naverage of 85 % of nonylphenol (NP) and 61 % of OP in primary sewage effluent and 7 \n23% of NP and 8% of OP in river water was bound to suspended sediments.  The 8 \nproportion of NP on suspended particles was up to 86% in treated sewage and water 9 \nfrom the river Aire (Blackburn and Waldock, 1995, Sheahan et al., 2002a), 12-58% in 10 \nwater samples from a range of other UK rivers (Blackburn et al., 1999), 6-25% and 2-11 \n42%  in samples from the Italian rivers Lambro  and Tiber respectively (Patrolecco et 12 \nal., 2006, Polesello et al., 2003).  In a Korean lake and its tributing creeks, Li et al.  13 \n(2004) found between 5 and 78% of the measured NP in the suspended particles and 14 \nthis proportion tended to be higher in winter than in summer.  Thus, despite the 15 \nrelatively low Kow, a significant proportion of alkylphenols may sometimes be found 16 \non suspended sediments in a real environmental situation. 17 \nIn this work, OP rather than the more ubiquitous NP was chosen, because unlike NP it 18 \nexists as a single isomer rather than a mixture.  There are, however, less data available 19 \nfor OP because it is less widely used than NP and therefore often not analysed or its 20 \nconcentration is below the detection limit.  Earlier work (Johnson et al., 1998) 21 \nsuggested that a significant proportion of OP could bind to suspended sediments, thus 22 \nreducing the concentration in the aqueous phase, but Isobe et al. (2001) found only an 23 \naverage of 8 % of the OP in rivers to be bound to suspended sediments.  It is 24 \nimportant to note that the suspended sediments in a river do not remain of a consistent 25 \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n Page 5 of 27 \ncomposition during the year.  For example, in slow flowing areas in summer a large 1 \nproportion of suspended sediments may consist of algae, whereas rainstorms can flush 2 \nout high concentrations of clay particles and at other times, the most significant 3 \ncontribution may be from decaying detritus. 4 \nFor an aquatic organism, sorption of alkylphenols to suspended sediments could mean 5 \na reduced exposure relative to inputs unless the chemical is taken up from the 6 \nparticles, for example by accidental or deliberate ingestion.  Ra et al. (2008) have 7 \nshown that the sorption of OP and pentachlorophenol to (artificial) suspended 8 \nparticles did indeed reduce the toxic effects on Daphnia magna and Vibrio fischeri, 9 \nbut because the toxicity tests were carried out after the contaminated particles were 10 \nremoved from the system by filtration, uptake of chemicals from the particles was 11 \nprecluded.  Uptake from sediments may be important because, at least with NP 12 \ncontaminated bed-sediments, about 95% of the chemical on the solids appeared to be 13 \nbioavailable (de Weert et al., 2008).  It is well known that the uptake of (xeno-) 14 \nestrogens via food can have endocrine effects on fish: increased vitellogenin 15 \nconcentrations in immature rainbow trout were, for example, measured after dietary 16 \nexposure to E2 (Carlson and Williams, 1999) and OP (Pedersen et al., 2003).  In the 17 \npresent study, the contaminated particles were not removed, so the animals were 18 \nexposed to OP and suspended sediments at the same time. 19 \nThe question posed in this study was therefore: What effect, if any, does the 20 \npartitioning of OP to suspended sediments have? Does it reduce the chemical\u2019s effect 21 \non fish by reducing the bioavailable aqueous concentration or does it increase its 22 \neffect through ingestion of suspended sediments, which contain a higher concentration 23 \nof the chemical than the water? 24 \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n Page 6 of 27 \nMaterial and Methods 1 \nDesign of aquarium agitator 2 \nIn order to study the effect of suspended sediments, they must be maintained in 3 \nsuspension within the water column without harming or unduly stressing the animals 4 \ninvolved in the study.  Several systems to expose animals to suspended sediment have 5 \nbeen described in the literature.  Generally the volume of water available to the 6 \nanimals is very limited compared to the size of the whole apparatus, which makes 7 \nthese designs either only suitable for small animals, such as invertebrates or fry (eg. 8 \nChilton, 1991, Schmidt-Dallmier et al., 1992, Schrap and Opperhuizen, 1989, Servizi 9 \nand Martens, 1991) or the apparatus requires considerable space, limiting the 10 \npracticability of the design (Cope et al., 1996).  Some authors have suggested a flow 11 \nthrough system with serial dilution of suspended sediments (eg. Sved and Roberts, 12 \n1995), a design which suffers from the practical problem of collecting sufficient 13 \namounts of natural suspended sediments to sustain such a setup.  Therefore, a new 14 \ncompact apparatus was developed which fits into a conventional glass aquarium (l: 60 15 \ncm, w: 30 cm, h: 40 cm) filled with 60 L Windermere lake water with the space 16 \navailable to the fish within the mesh basket being approximately 35 L (figure 1).  The 17 \ndevice consists of a motor-driven bar that runs laterally back and forth along the base 18 \nof the aquarium at a speed of about 8 cm\/s, combined with a wire mesh basket within 19 \nwhich the experimental animals were held.  Preliminary tests of this equipment 20 \nshowed that OP sorption to glass and steel was negligible (less than 1 % in the entire 21 \naquarium setup), so all parts of the stirring mechanism to be immersed were 22 \nconstructed from stainless steel.  However, there was a significant loss of chemical 23 \ndue to sorption to the silicone sealant used in aquaria; this was monitored in each 24 \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n Page 7 of 27 \nexperiment by including control aquaria containing no fish.  Although the device 1 \ncreated sufficient motion to prevent particulate material from settling, the suspended 2 \nsediments started to stick to the surfaces (even vertical surfaces), of both the aquarium 3 \nitself and the mesh basket.  These particles were re-suspended once each day by 4 \ndisconnecting the stirrer bar from the motor and manually moving it along the 5 \naquarium at increased speed three to four times.  Care was taken to do this in the same 6 \nway for all aquaria, including the ones without suspended sediments, to ensure that the 7 \ndisturbance experienced by the confined fish due to unexpected movement did not 8 \ndiffer between treatments.   9 \nCollection of suspended sediments 10 \nNatural suspended sediments (table 1) were collected with a continuous flow 11 \ncentrifuge (Alfa-Laval SediSamp System II, model WSB\/103-ENV) from the River 12 \nCalder in Yorkshire at Methley Bridge (National Grid Reference SE 408 257).  On 13 \none occasion (14\/15-5-01) the suspended sediments was taken about 13 km further 14 \nupstream at Stanley Ferry (National Grid Reference SE 355 231), because the original 15 \nsampling site at Methley Bridge was not accessible.  It was expected that the 16 \nsuspended sediments would not differ significantly between the two sites even though 17 \nthere is a small sewage works about 2 km upstream of Methley Bridge.  At each of the 18 \nsampling occasions, water samples were also taken to determine the ambient 19 \nsuspended sediment concentration as dry weight retained on a 0.45\u00b5m cellulose 20 \nnitrate filter (Whatman, Maidstone, Kent, U.K.).  The Stanley Ferry sample was also 21 \nused by Holthaus et al. (2002) where the surface area is given as 5.5 m2\/g and 22 \nparticulate organic carbon as about 14%. The concentrated suspended sediment slurry 23 \nwas stored at 4\u00b0C up to three weeks prior to use in the fish exposure experiments.   24 \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n Page 8 of 27 \nDetermination of a sorption distribution coefficient for the 1 \nsuspended sediments 2 \nA sub-sample of the concentrated suspended sediment slurry was used to determine a 3 \nsorption distribution coefficient.  A 5 ml aliquot of suspended sediment slurry was 4 \nadded to PTFE centrifuge tubes and 14C-labelled OP was added to duplicate tubes to 5 \nmake final concentrations of 2,4,6,8, and 10 \u00b5g\/L with the exception of the last 6 \nexperiment (River Calder, Stanley Ferry sample, May 2001) which was done at 10 7 \nfold higher concentrations to increase the accuracy.  The tubes were then put on an 8 \norbital shaker (90 rpm) for 1 hr, after which they were centrifuged (15 min, 4750 g) 9 \nand the aqueous phase was sampled, by transferring 1 ml into scintillation vials and 10 \nmixing it with 5 ml scintillant (Ultima Gold, Packard Biosciences, Groningen, The 11 \nNetherlands).  The vials were then placed in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckmann 12 \nLS 6500, Beckman instruments, Fullerton, CA, USA) and counted for 5 min.  The 13 \ncounts were compared with those obtained from standards of radiolabelled OP in de-14 \nionized water and the amount sorbed was calculated by difference.  The slope of a 15 \nbest-fit line through the data for solid phase versus aqueous phase concentration 16 \nyielded the distribution coefficient (Kd).  To test the influence of suspended sediment 17 \nconcentration on sorption, this was repeated with suspended sediment samples (River 18 \nCalder, Methley Bridge sample, January 2001), which were rediluted 1:2 or 1:10 with 19 \nriver water collected at the same time and place. 20 \nTesting for potential loss of OP through microbial degradation 21 \nduring experimental setup 22 \nTo test whether there was the potential for a significant loss of chemical due to 23 \nmicrobial degradation, two experiments were carried out.   24 \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n Page 9 of 27 \nThe potential for OP degradation in natural river water was tested by spiking water 1 \ncollected from two sites (River Thames at Iffley Lock, Oxford, UK and Wallingford, 2 \nOxfordshire, UK, July 1999) with OP at a nominal concentration of 100 \u00b5g\/L in 3 \ntriplicate and incubating at 10\u00b0C in the dark.  Autoclaved (20 min, 121 \u00b0C) river water 4 \nserved as a sterile control.  At regular intervals, sub-samples were taken and analysed 5 \nas described below. 6 \nTo examine whether the rapid decline of octylphenol concentrations in the aquaria 7 \nwas due to uptake by fish or to enhanced biodegradation due to fish waste products 8 \nstimulating microbioal activity, degradation rates were compared in water samples 9 \nwith and without waste products.  Triplicate water samples were taken from the 10 \nunspiked aquaria (with and without suspended sediments) after an experiment, i.e.  the 11 \nfish had spent 3 days in this water and it therefore contained shedded mucus etc., but 12 \nno OP.  These were compared to fresh water and to fresh water with added suspended 13 \nsediments.  All samples were spiked with OP at a nominal concentration of 500 \u00b5g\/L 14 \nand analysed for OP immediately and after 3 and 6 days at 10\u00b0C.   15 \nWater quality parameters 16 \nDissolved oxygen and pH meters (Jenway Instruments) were used to monitor these 17 \nparameters in all experiments.  In the 100 \u00b5g\/L OP and 500 \u00b5g\/L OP experiments 18 \nNH4\/NH3+ was measured with a kit based on the indophenol method (ammonia test kit 19 \nfor fresh and salt water, HAGEN, Canada) and NO2-, and NO3- were measured only in 20 \nthe last (500 \u00b5g\/L OP) experiment (Tetratest, Germany, kits for NO2 and NO3).  In the 21 \n500 \u00b5g\/L OP experiment the accuracy of these tests was improved by measuring the 22 \nabsorption at 650 nm for NH4\/NH3+ and 540 nm for NO2- and NO3- and comparing it 23 \nto suitable standards (NH4Cl, NaNO2, NaNO3 respectively), instead of visual 24 \ncomparison with the supplied colour charts. 25 \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n Page 10 of 27 \nOP concentration in water and suspended sediments 1 \nA 250 ml water sample was removed from the aquaria and filtered (glass fibre GF\/C, 2 \nWhatman, Maidstone, UK).  The amount of OP sorbed to suspended sediments was 3 \ndetermined by immediately extracting the damp filter with 20 ml methanol for at least 4 \n24 hrs and, where necessary, concentrating the methanol extract by rotary evaporation 5 \n(50\u00b0C, approximately 600 mm Hg vacuum) to 2 ml.  This sample was then diluted 6 \nwith an equal amount of de-ionized water and the OP concentration measured by 7 \nHPLC\/MS in electrospray negative mode (sometimes after further dilution).  The 8 \nconcentration of OP in the aqueous phase was determined by withdrawing 1 ml into a 9 \nsyringe that already contained 1 ml methanol, mixing and then filtering the mixture 10 \nthrough a 0.45 \u00b5m-PTFE filter (Gelman Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) into a HPLC 11 \nvial.  The presence of methanol prevents sorption to the filter or glass vial and inhibits 12 \ndegradation during storage.  The vials were sealed with PTFE\/silicone septa and 13 \nstored in the dark at 4\u00b0C until analysis.  To determine low concentrations of OP,  14 \n250 ml filtered sample was passed through a C18-solid phase extraction cartridge 15 \n(Varian Bond Elut 500 mg, 3 cc, Varian, Inc.  Palo Alto, CA, USA), which was then 16 \nextracted with 1 ml methanol and the extract was diluted with 1 ml water before 17 \nanalysis by HPLC\/MS. 18 \nPlasma vitellogenin and cortisol concentrations 19 \nAt the end of the one week exposure period, fish were anaesthetised by immersion in a 20 \n2-phenoxyethanol (Sigma-Aldrich) solution (ca. 1:2000) and about 500 \u00b5L blood was 21 \nwithdrawn from the caudal vessel using a heparinized syringe.  The blood was 22 \ncentrifuged (10 min, 3600 rpm) and the supernatant plasma divided into sub-samples 23 \nwhich were stored frozen (-18\u00b0C) until analysis with previously validated 24 \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n Page 11 of 27 \nradioimmunoassays for vitellogenin (Sumpter, 1985) as a measure of estrogenic 1 \neffects, or cortisol as a measure of general stress (Pottinger and Carrick, 2001).  To 2 \ncontrol for overall effects of the experimental manipulations five to six fish each were 3 \nalso sampled at the beginning and end of each experiment directly from the stock 4 \npopulation holding ponds. 5 \nExposure of fish to OP with or without suspended sediments 6 \npresent 7 \nExperimental setup  8 \nImmature (10-18 months old) rainbow trout from commercial suppliers (Hawkshead 9 \nTrout Farm, Cumbria, UK) were used in all experiments.  In order to reduce problems 10 \ncaused by faecal material, food was withheld from the fish for at least three days 11 \n(normally 1 week) before the start of each experiment and they were not fed during 12 \nthe one week exposure period.  The temperature was kept at 10\u00b0C and an artificial 13 \nlight regime of 12 hours light\/12 hours darkness was used.   14 \nSuspended sediments were added to the aquaria from concentrated slurry and OP was 15 \nadded from stock solutions dissolved in ethanol (up to 1 ml ethanol per tank); control 16 \ntanks received the same amount of pure ethanol.  Then the water was mixed for two 17 \nhours, using the agitator described above, before water and suspended sediment 18 \nsamples were collected and the fish were added.  To reduce problems due to 19 \ndeteriorating water quality, especially ammonia build-up, the fish were transferred to 20 \nan identical set of aquaria, prepared with the same concentrations of OP and 21 \nsuspended sediments, after 4 days.  Further water and suspended sediment samples 22 \nwere taken from both aquaria immediately after the fish were removed.   23 \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n Page 12 of 27 \nThis semi-static rather than a flow through system had to be used, because of the 1 \ndifficulties of collecting sufficient amounts of natural suspended sediments, especially 2 \nduring low flow conditions and the difficulties of maintaining a relatively constant 3 \nsediment concentration in a flow through system.  Low flow is more interesting in 4 \nconnection with alkylphenols because their concentrations are likely to be higher 5 \nduring periods with little dilution. 6 \nStatistical analysis 7 \nWith exception of the range finding experiment, which had small differences between 8 \nthe two runs (see below), the experiments consisted of duplicate runs with identical 9 \nsetup.  A two sample t-test, assuming unequal variances was carried out on the log-10 \ntransformed vitellogenin and cortisol data to test for significant differences between 11 \nthe two runs of the same treatment and between the different treatments.  Where there 12 \nwas no significant difference (P>0.05) between the two runs, all fish from both runs 13 \nwere treated as one group, but where there was a significant difference between the 14 \nrepeat runs,  we compared each of the two runs separately to the other treatments and 15 \nonly assigned significance where the difference was in the same direction and 16 \nsignificant for both runs.   17 \nRange finding experiment 18 \nTo establish a suitable OP concentration for the experiments a range finding study was 19 \ncarried out.  This consisted of four aquaria with 20 mg\/L suspended sediment and 0, 20 \n10, 100 and 1000 \u00b5g\/L OP, together with one clean water control and a \u201cchemical 21 \ncontrol\u201d with suspended sediments and 100 \u00b5g\/L OP, but no fish.  Five juvenile 22 \nfemale rainbow trout (average weight 59 g, range 37-83 g) were added to each 23 \naquarium.  Accidentally, the 10 and 100 \u00b5g\/L aquaria received only 2 mg\/L suspended 24 \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n Page 13 of 27 \nsediments at the start of the experiment.  When the error was discovered after one day, 1 \nthe remaining suspended sediment was added.  This experiment  differed from the 2 \nstandard setup in that there was only 55 L water, the fish were not transferred to a 3 \nsecond set of aquaria, and water and suspended sediment samples were taken more 4 \nfrequently. 5 \nThis experiment was repeated with the following alterations.  (i) To reduce water 6 \nquality problems, especially with regard to ammonia from the fish waste products, a 7 \ncomplete water change was introduced after four days, by moving all fish into a 8 \nsecond set of aquaria which had been prepared to contain the same initial 9 \nconcentrations of OP and suspended sediments as the first one.  (ii) As there was not 10 \nsufficient suspended sediment slurry remaining to provide the two aquaria needed for 11 \neach treatment with 20 mg\/L, the suspended sediment concentration was reduced to 12 \n10 mg\/L.  The average weight of the fish was 73 g (range 49-91g). 13 \nIn the 1000 \u00b5g\/L treatment of the second run, three out of the five fish showed signs 14 \nof toxic effects one day after they were moved to the second aquarium, it was 15 \ntherefore decided to sample the fish in this treatment immediately (i.e.  after a total of 16 \n5 days). 17 \n100 \u00b5g\/L OP experiment 18 \nFollowing the range finding experiment, an experiment was designed with a nominal 19 \nOP concentration of 100 \u00b5g\/L.  Suspended sediment slurry (River Calder, Methley 20 \nBridge, January 2001) was added to 60 L water to give a final solid concentration of 21 \n10 mg\/L, which is a typical ambient suspended sediment concentration at this 22 \nsampling site (Wass and Leeks, 1999).  Six rainbow trout (mixed sex, about 10 23 \nmonths old, average weight 82g (50-111g)) were added to each aquarium. 24 \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n Page 14 of 27 \nThe following replicated treatments were set up: clean water; water with 10 mg\/L 1 \nsuspended sediments; water with 100 \u00b5g\/L OP; water with 10 mg\/L suspended 2 \nsediments and 100 \u00b5g\/L OP; two \u201cchemical controls\u201d without fish comprising: water 3 \nwith 100 \u00b5g\/L OP and water with 100 \u00b5g\/L OP and 10 mg\/L suspended sediments.   4 \n500 \u00b5g\/L OP experiment 5 \nThe experiment above was repeated with a 500 \u00b5g\/L concentration of OP and 20 6 \nmg\/L suspended sediments (River Calder, Stanley Ferry, May 2001).  To reduce 7 \nvariability and allow comparison to the previous experiments when the fish were a 8 \nfew months younger, relatively small fish (mixed sex, about 15 months old, average 9 \nweight 60 g (41-79g)) were selected from the stock.   10 \nResults 11 \nPreliminary tests 12 \nLoss of OP through microbial degradation 13 \nThe batch degradation experiment of OP in river water at 10\u00b0C gave estimated half-14 \nlives of 27 and 28 days for the samples from Wallingford and Iffley, respectively.  In 15 \nsimilar experiments with a range of river samples, half-lives between one and ten 16 \nweeks were found for the higher incubation temperature of 20\u00b0C (Johnson et al., 17 \n2000).  Bearing in mind that a temperature reduction from 20\u00b0C to 10\u00b0C is generally 18 \nexpected to halve the biodegradation rate, losses from biodegradation were expected 19 \nto be small in the fish exposure experiments, which ran for seven days at 10\u00b0C.   20 \nWhen testing whether the fish waste products increased the rate of degradation of OP, 21 \nno loss of chemical was observed over six days in any of the four treatments (fresh 22 \nwater, fresh water with suspended sediments, water from aquarium, water from 23 \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n Page 15 of 27 \naquarium with added suspended sediments).  This confirmed that greater losses of 1 \nchemical in the aquaria with fish compared to the chemical control (without fish) were 2 \ndue to uptake by the fish, not enhanced degradation.   3 \nSorption distribution coefficients (Kd) 4 \nThe sorption distribution coefficients (Kd) were about 400-1,500 L\/kg (table 1).  5 \nAssuming a linear sorption isotherm to extrapolate to low solids to liquid ratios, no 6 \nmore than 3 % would be expected to sorb to any of the suspended sediment samples at 7 \nthe concentration of 10-20 mg\/L used in the aquaria 8 \nFish exposure experiments 9 \nWater Quality 10 \nThe concentrations of NO2 and NO3 were low with 0-0.1 mg\/L and 0-12 mg\/L 11 \nrespectively, total ammonia was <3.7 mg\/L (100 \u00b5g\/L OP experiment, from colour 12 \nchart) or 0-2.0 mg\/L in 500 \u00b5g\/L OP experiment, (photometric) with pH 7.6-7.9, 13 \nindicating that water quality was starting to deteriorate at the time when the water was 14 \nchanged, but was still within an acceptable range. 15 \nExposure of fish to OP with or without sediments present 16 \nThe OP concentrations measured in the aquaria, before fish were added, were close 17 \nto the nominal values and then declined rapidly during the exposure period (figure 2 18 \nand table 2).  The decline is believed to be largely due to fish uptake because, as 19 \nmentioned above, the biodegradation rate was slow and although OP concentrations 20 \nwere also decreasing in the absence of fish, the decline was much faster when fish 21 \nwere present.  The proportion of OP initially partitioning into the suspended sediments 22 \nwas between 3% and 15% (average 8%) and therefore somewhat higher than the value 23 \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n Page 16 of 27 \nexpected from the Kd experiments (see above) which were done at a much higher 1 \nsolids to liquid ratio.  The load of OP on the suspended sediments also reduced over 2 \ntime, but whether the fish took it up directly from the sediments, or whether it 3 \nrepartitioned into the water first, cannot be fully ascertained from these data.  Some 4 \nre-partitioning into the water phase was evident because the OP concentrations 5 \nmeasured in the water at the end of the exposure period were higher in the treatments 6 \nwith suspended sediments than in the ones without.  Small amounts of OP were 7 \nmeasured even in the treatments where it had not been added.  It is not clear, whether 8 \nthis was due to background contamination of the water or suspended sediments or to 9 \nexperimental artefacts such as cross contamination during sample preparation and 10 \nanalysis. 11 \nCortisol data are only available for the 100 \u00b5g\/L experiment.  In none of the 12 \ntreatments were the cortisol levels of male fish significantly different from the clean 13 \nwater controls, but those of the females were significantly lower (P<0.01) in the pond 14 \ncontrol and higher (P<0.01) in the treatment with octylphenol but no suspended 15 \nsediments. 16 \nPlasma vitellogenin concentrations after one week of exposure to different OP 17 \nconcentrations (range finding experiment) are shown in figure 3.  Although the 18 \nprotocol of the two runs of the experiment differed slightly (First run: no water 19 \nchange, 20 mg\/L suspended sediments; second run: one water change, 10 mg\/L 20 \nsuspended sediments), the results were very similar and are therefore reported 21 \ntogether.  High OP concentrations produced, as expected, a dose dependent increase in 22 \nvitellogenin levels.  From these results it was concluded that 100 \u00b5g\/L OP was a 23 \nsuitable concentration for assessing the effects of OP with or without suspended 24 \nsediments (see below), as it gave a significant (P<0.01) vitellogenin increase without 25 \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n Page 17 of 27 \nobvious signs of toxic effects.  The treatments with suspended sediments and no OP or 1 \n10 \u00b5g\/L OP had lower VTG levels than both the pre-treatment controls from the 2 \nponds and the clean water control, but the difference was only significant (P<0.05) for 3 \nthe 10 \u00b5g\/L OP + suspended sediment treatment.  In both other experiments (figure 4 4 \nand figure 5) the females also showed a lower vitellogenin response in the treatment 5 \nwith suspended sediments but no chemical, compared to the clean water and pond 6 \ncontrols.  Due to the low number of individuals involved and the high variability 7 \nbetween individuals, the differences were not significant in the 100 \u00b5g\/L experiment 8 \nthough (figure 4).   9 \nFollowing from the range finding experiment it was expected that exposure of juvenile 10 \nrainbow trout to a nominal concentration of 100 \u00b5g\/L would give a clear vitellogenin 11 \nresponse.  However, in this experiment, the results were inconclusive with no 12 \nsignificant differences in the vitellogenin levels between the controls and the exposed 13 \nfish (figure 4).  Therefore, the experiment was repeated at the higher concentration of 14 \n500 \u00b5g\/L (figure 5).  In the 500 \u00b5g\/L experiment, no mortalities were observed and, 15 \ndespite the high OP concentrations, the fish showed no obvious signs of toxic effects.  16 \nThe nominal concentration of 500 \u00b5g\/L OP led to a strong vitellogenin response in all 17 \nthe exposed fish compared to the clean water and pond controls and compared to the 18 \nfish that had only been exposed to suspended sediments (figure 5).  The vitellogenin 19 \nlevels of the fish exposed to OP in the presence of suspended sediments were over all 20 \nslightly higher than in their absence in both experiments, but this difference was not 21 \nstatistically significant (at the P<0.05 level, figure 4 and figure 5) once the difference 22 \nbetween the repeat runs was taken into account.   23 \nIn both mixed sex experiments, males always had lower average vitellogenin levels 24 \nthan females apart from the groups exposed to 500 \u00b5g\/L.   25 \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n Page 18 of 27 \nDiscussion  1 \n1) OP and suspended sediments 2 \nThere are few studies of OP and suspended sediments, but Isobe et al.  (2001) found 3 \nan average of 8%\u00b18% of OP compared to 23%\u00b115% of NP bound to suspended 4 \nsediments in river waters in the Tokyo area.  This difference between those two 5 \nalkylphenols would be expected because NP is slightly more hydrophobic than OP.  In 6 \nthe fish exposure experiments in the present paper, on average also about 8% (range 7 \n3-15%) of OP was found on the suspended sediments.   8 \nWhen the distribution coefficients from batch sorption experiments with high solids to 9 \nliquid ratios were used to predict OP sorption in the fish experiments, the proportion 10 \nof OP on the solids was expected to be lower than this, at around 3%, but the use of 11 \ndifferent solids to liquid ratios in the Jan 2001 sample showed that a high ratio can 12 \nlead to underestimation of the sorption at realistic solids concentrations (table 1).  13 \nDespite these difficulties of accurately measuring Kd, the experiments show that only 14 \na small proportion (less than 15%) of OP partitioned into these suspended sediments.   15 \nIn these batch experiments, the suspended sediments had two effects on the OP 16 \nconcentration in the water phase, initially reducing them by a small amount but re-17 \nreleasing some OP into solution once the aqueous concentrations had been sufficiently 18 \nreduced through uptake by the fish.  Because of this, the OP concentrations in the 19 \nwater phase at the end of each exposure period were consistently higher in the 20 \ntreatments with suspended sediments than in those without.  Some of the OP that was 21 \ninitially removed from the water was returned, reducing the overall effect the 22 \nsuspended sediments had on water concentrations.  This higher final concentration 23 \nmay explain the slightly higher (although not significant at P<0.05) vitellogenin levels 24 \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n Page 19 of 27 \nobserved after exposure to OP with suspended sediments compared to that without.  In 1 \nthe environment, alkylphenols would be constantly replenished so long as the source 2 \n(eg. contaminated sewage treatment works effluents) remained, therefore the exposure 3 \nwould be relatively constant and not declining rapidly as in the present batch 4 \nexperiments.   5 \n 6 \n2) OP and VTG 7 \nThe production and depuration of vitellogenin is relatively slow: Serum vitellogenin 8 \nconcentrations in rainbow trout have been reported to reach peak values 3 weeks after 9 \nthe fish were injected with E2 and did not return to basal levels until five months later 10 \n(Elliott et al., 1979, quoted from Panter et al 2000).  Therefore, the VTG levels we 11 \nmeasured immediately after the one week exposure may not represent the maximum.   12 \nCare must also be taken when comparing the vitellogenin response to a particular 13 \nnominal concentration of OP in the present study with those of flow through studies, 14 \nwhere the water concentration is kept constant, because in this batch setup the OP 15 \nconcentration declined rapidly, mostly due to uptake by the fish (figure 2).  This may 16 \nexplain the difference between the results of Servos (1999), who quotes acute LC 50 17 \nfor OP and rainbow trout of 450 \u00b5g\/L over 24 hours or 120 \u00b5g\/L over 14 days, and the 18 \npresent study where a nominal concentration as high as 500 \u00b5g\/L produced no obvious 19 \ntoxic effects, and even at 1000 \u00b5g\/L toxic effects became only apparent after the water 20 \nwas changed and therefore the fish were exposed to a second spike of OP.  The 21 \naverage concentration in the present setup is perhaps about 20% of the nominal, but 22 \nthis value cannot be directly used for comparison either because research by Panter et 23 \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n Page 20 of 27 \nal. (2000) showed that the maximum concentration may be sometimes more important 1 \nthan the average.   2 \nIn all but the highest (500 \u00b5g\/L) OP concentration, average vitellogenin levels of the 3 \nmale fish were consistently lower than those of the females in the same treatment.  4 \nThis confirms previous reports that even immature females produce more vitellogenin 5 \nthan males of the same age, but that this difference can disappear after exposure to 6 \nhigh levels of (xeno)estrogens eg. dietary E2 (Carlson and Williams, 1999) or dietary 7 \nOP (Pedersen et al., 2003).   8 \n 9 \n3) Sediments only and VTG 10 \nIn the treatments with suspended sediments but no chemicals, vitellogenin levels in 11 \nthe females were overall slightly lower than in the clean water controls, although the 12 \ndifference was only significant in the range-finding experiment.  Possible causes of 13 \nthis effect can be chemicals on the suspended sediments acting as anti-estrogens or the 14 \nsuspended sediments indirectly influencing the VTG production, for example if the 15 \nturbidity was a cause of stress that in turn led to lower vitellogenin production.  16 \nPlasma cortisol levels were determined in the 100 \u00b5g\/L experiment, in order to assess 17 \nwhether the experimental setup was inherently stressful to the fish, but the results 18 \nshowed no increase in cortisol in the treatments with suspended sediments (figure 4).  19 \nThere was also no obvious relation between vitellogenin and cortisol levels of 20 \nindividual fish in any of the treatments (data not shown), suggesting that stress was 21 \nprobably not the explanation of these differences.  However, as for vitellogenin, the 22 \ncortisol levels at the time of sampling may not be wholly representative of those 23 \nearlier in the study. 24 \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n Page 21 of 27 \n 1 \n4) OP sediments and VTG 2 \nThe vitellogenin levels of the OP exposed fish were not significantly reduced by the 3 \npresence of suspended sediments.  Although the amount of OP sorbed to the 4 \nsuspended sediments was only small in absolute terms, the Kds show that the 5 \nconcentration on the suspended sediments is about 1000 times as high as that in the 6 \nwater (table 1).  Therefore, the accidental ingestion of even quite small amounts of 7 \nsuspended sediments could contribute significantly to the uptake of alkylphenols by 8 \nexposed fish.  However, theoretical considerations and experimental data suggest, that 9 \nfor chemicals with a moderate log Kow of 4-5 (log Kow of OP is 4.1) the uptake via 10 \nfood would be less than 10% of the total if the fish and their prey were exposed to the 11 \nsame aqueous concentrations (Qiao et al., 2000, Randall et al., 1998).  In addition, it 12 \nhas been shown that the estrogenic response is stronger if fish are exposed to 13 \nalkylphenols via water than if the same amount enters their body via food (Pickford et 14 \nal., 2003) and there is only limited opportunity for bioaccumulation, which might 15 \notherwise increase the exposure via food, because alkylphenols are relatively rapidly 16 \nbiodegraded at least under aerobic conditions (Johnson et al., 2000). The uptake via 17 \nsuspended sediments would be even less than that via food, because the suspended 18 \nsediments are not deliberately ingested.   19 \nConclusions 20 \nIn summary, even with relatively high concentrations of suspended sediments from an 21 \nurbanised lowland river the majority of the xenobiotic EDC OP is still substantially 22 \npartitioned into the water phase.  These data suggest that OP bound to suspended 23 \nsediments does not increase the ED risk to the fish.  We conclude that disruption of 24 \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n Page 22 of 27 \nthe reproductive endocrine system arising from exposure to OP and perhaps other  1 \noestrogenic chemicals with log Kow <5 is therefore likely to be due primarily to uptake 2 \nof the dissolved chemical across the gill epithelium rather than via the ingestion of 3 \nsuspended sediments, or interaction of sediment particles with the gill surface.   4 \n 5 \nAcknowledgements 6 \nThe authors wish to thank the EU COMPREHEND project for funding this work, 7 \nJohn White for making the aquarium stirrers, Edwin Routledge for vitellogenin 8 \nanalysis, Dave Abel, J\u00f6rg Arnold, Toby Carrick and Jennifer Davies for much help 9 \nwith sampling and running experiments, Lal Bhardwaj and Neville Llewellyn for the 10 \nOP analysis, and Alan Pickering for leading the COMPREHEND project and many 11 \nhelpful suggestions. 12 \nReferences 13 \nAhel, M., Giger, W., 1993.
