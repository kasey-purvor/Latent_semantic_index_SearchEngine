Peatlands also represent an important source of \ndissolved organic carbon to drainage waters (Urban et al. 1989; Billett et al. 2004; \nDawson et al. 2004). As soluble nitrogen is often limited, soil-atmosphere fluxes \nof N2O tend to be small, although with a global warming potential of 298 (IPCC \n2007) they can still contribute significantly to the total GHG budget. Some of the \nprimary consequences of climate change, including increased temperatures, \nincreased drought and increased frequency and intensity of rainfall events, are \nlikely to directly influence peatland ecosystems. This in addition to management \npractices such as peatland drainage, means that it is becoming increasingly \nimportant to accurately predict the biospheric feedbacks of peatlands to climate.  \nThe main controls on soil carbon and nitrogen cycling in peatlands are a) \ntemperature, as it controls the rate of microbial activity; b) water table depth as it \ndetermines the depth of the oxic\/anoxic boundary and redox level within the soil; \nand c) plant community composition and structure which influences the quantity \nand quality of organic substrate available, and can alter the aerobic capacity of the \npeat by transporting O2 to the rhizosphere (Bartlett and Harriss 1993; Dise et al. \n1993; Str\u00f6m et al. 2003; Whiting and Chanton 1996; Yavitt et al. 1997). In the \nsame way that certain plant species have the ability to transport O2 from the \natmosphere to the rhizosphere, they can provide a direct pathway for many GHGs \nto the atmosphere, bypassing the aerobic peat horizon (Bartlett and Harriss 1993; \nMinkkinen and Laine 2006). Such plant mediated transport has been demonstrated \nto account for >80% of CH4 emissions from rice paddies (Butterbach-Bahl et al. \n1997; Yu et al. 1997).  \nThe microtopographic pattern of elevated hummocks, wetter hollows and \nsubmerged pools, typical of many peatlands, can cause significant variation in soil \nenvironmental conditions (Nungesser 2003). Such differences are further \nreinforced by the colonisation of distinct plant communities. As a result GHG \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \nproduction, emission and consumption within peatlands can vary considerably at \nscales <1 m2. Problems arise when gas exchange measurements, made using \nchambers of usually <0.5 m2, require up-scaling to catchment level. \nThe influence of water table depth on CO2 and CH4 soil-atmosphere exchange has \nbeen studied repeatedly using flask experiments on disturbed peat (Blodau and \nMoore 2003a; \u00d6quist and Sundh 1998), measurements on relatively undisturbed \npeat cores (Aerts and Ludwig 1997; Moore and Dalva 1993), and field studies \n(Hargreaves and Fowler 1998; MacDonald et al. 1998). Only a small number of \ncontrolled experiments have been carried out with the vegetation structure intact \n(Blodau et al. 2004; Blodau and Moore 2003a). Fewer still have compared \ndifferent vegetation\/microtopography types (though examples include: Updegraff \net al. 2001), despite studies showing that the influence of vegetation is species-\nspecific (Butterbach-Bahl et al. 1997; Str\u00f6m et al. 2005). Such comparisons are \nimportant as the relative coverage of each community type may be altered \nfollowing ecological succession resulting from long-term environmental change \n(Strack et al. 2006; Weltzin et al. 2003). The general consensus from these studies \nis that lowering the water table increases C mineralization and decreases CH4 \nemissions. Studies into the effects of water table depth on peatland N2O emissions \ninclude those by Aerts and Ludwig (1997) and Regina et al. (1999); they conclude \nthat lowering the water table depth leads to a net increase in N2O emissions.  \nThe aims of this study are: a) to compare the greenhouse gas budget (with \nemphasis on CH4 and N2O) and temperature response of peatland mesocosms \nunder high and low water table conditions; b) to quantify the immediate CH4 and \nN2O exchange response to a sudden changes in water table depth; and c) to assess \nthe influence of vegetation\/microtopography on these responses.  \nMaterials and Methods: \nSite Description \nCores were collected from Auchencorth peatland (55\u00ba47\u201934N; 3\u00ba14\u201935W), \napproximately 17 km south west of Edinburgh (Scotland). Mean annual \nprecipitation at the site (1995-2006) is 1016 mm (Coyle, unpublished data, 2008) \n3 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \nwith maximum and minimum monthly mean temperatures (1971-2000) of 19 \u00baC \nin July and 0.7 \u00baC in January respectively (www.metoffice.gov.uk). \nThe catchment is a 335 ha grass dominated, lowland ombrotrophic peatland with \nan elevation range of 249 to 300 m (Billett et al. 2004). The land-use is primarily \nlow intensity sheep grazing, though overgrown ditches are evidence of past \ndrainage. The vegetation is a patchy mix of coarse grasses and soft rush covering \na Sphagnum base layer. Calluna vulgaris is present in the south-west of the \ncatchment where drainage is better. The microtopography consists of a series of \nhummocks and hollows. Hummocks are typically small (~40 cm diameter, ~30 \ncm height) and dominated by either a mix of Deschamsia flexuosa and \nEriophorum vaginatum, or Juncus effusus. Hollows refer to the areas between \nhummocks and are dominated by mosses (Sphagnum papillosa and Polytrichum \ncommune) and a thinner layer of grasses; hollows often become submerged after \nperiods of intense or sustained rainfall. Water table at the site generally fluctuates \nbetween the peat surface and ~20 cm depth, although during dry periods it is often \ndrawn down to >35 cm (Coyle, unpublished data, 2008). The mean water \nextractable DOC is 312 \u00b1 15.9 (SE) \u00b5g C g-1 dry soil and KCL extractable NO3- \nand NH4+ are 4.45 \u00b1 0.48 (SE) and 21.8 \u00b1 1.85 (SE) \u00b5g N g-1 dry soil, respectively \n(Dinsmore, unpublished data, 2008). Total N and S deposition at the site are 16.5 \nkg N ha-1 a-1 and 6.9 kg S ha-1 a-1 respectively (Smith, personal communication, \n2008).  \nTo minimise variation in factors other than microtopography, the cores were all \ncollected within an area of approximately 10 m2. Peat depth at the sample site was \napproximately 0.5 m, overlaying a mineral subsoil. Peat core pH ranged from 3.8-\n4.3, typical of the catchment as a whole which ranges from 3.6-4.6 (Dinsmore, \nunpublished data). Mean bulk density was 0.12 g cm-3.  \nExperimental Design \nThree distinct peatland topographic\/vegetation features were identified as \ncomprising the majority of the field heterogeneity; hollows, hummocks dominated \nby the rush Juncus effusus, and hummocks dominated by a mixture of grass and \nsedge. Eight cores were collected from each ecotope in December 2006; 24 cores \nin total. A 30 cm diameter, 50 cm long, stainless-steel, cylindrical corer was used \n4 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \nto cut into the peat. The core was then dug out, cut to size and immediately \ntransferred to near-parallel sided buckets (30 cm diameter, 41 cm height) with as \nlittle disturbance to the soil as possible. The following terminology will be used \nhenceforth in reference to the 3 different mesocosm types: hummock + J. effusus \n(Juncus\/Hummock), hummock + grass and sedge (Sedge\/Hummock), hollow \n(Hollow). \nDip wells, consisting of perforated pipes inserted into the soil and sealed at the top \nwith rubber bungs, were placed into each mesocosm. Deep and shallow soil \natmosphere wells were created by inserting water tight, gas permeable tubing \n(Accurel\u00a9, Gut et al. 1998) horizontally into the mesocosms at depths of 10 cm \nand 30 cm below the soil surface. The Accurel\u00a9 was sealed to gas tight tubing \n(using Plasti Dip\u00a9) which was then extended to the mesocosm surface for sample \ncollection (Fig. 1); the surface sampling port was closed to the atmosphere using a \n3-way tap. Mesocosms were individually placed within larger buckets and the \nspace between filled with polystyrene chips to insulate and mimic field conditions \n(Fig. 1). Each mesocosm was assigned to either a high or low water table group, \nleading to a repeated measures factorial design. The mesocosms were arranged \nusing a randomised block design into 6 rows of 4 under a rain shelter, located \noutside the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology Edinburgh, approximately 10 km \nfrom the Auchencorth Moss field site. Mesocosms were allowed to acclimatise in-\nsitu for 4 weeks before measurements began. \nStatic water table treatment \nFrom core collection until the end of May 2007, water table depth was held \nconstant by daily inspection and manually refilling with rain water collected on-\nsite. The mean ion concentrations in rainwater (mmol m-2 week-1), measured from \nJune to October 2006, were as follows: Sodium 0.56; Ammonium 0.26; Potassium \n0.05; Calcium 0.37; Magnesium 0.13; Chloride 0.85; Nitrate 0.36; Sulphate 0.34 \n(Cape et al., pre-publication, 2008). Water table depth in the high and low water \ntable groups was held at 0-5 cm and 30-35 cm below the soil surface, respectively. \nWeekly measurements of CH4 and N2O were made using static chambers. A clear \nplastic lid was sealed to each mesocosm and air samples collected at time zero, \nafter 20 minutes and after 40 minutes. Soil air samples were collected weekly \nfrom the gas permeable tubing, and water samples collected fortnightly from the \n5 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \ndip wells. Soil temperature at ~5 cm was measured at the same time as flux \nmeasurements and soil atmosphere sampling. Total mesocosm net ecosystem \nexchange (NEE) was measured using a static chamber connected to a PP-Systems \nEGM-4 infrared gas analyser, which measures CO2 concentrations every 4 \nseconds. Measurements were made under 4 different light conditions produced \nusing full sunlight, 1 shade cloth, 2 shade cloths and a black out cloth and \ncombined to produce light response curves. Photosynthetically active radiation \n(PAR) and temperature were measured inside the NEE chamber alongside CO2 \nconcentration. Photosynthesis was calculated as total NEE minus the combined \nplant and soil respiration (NEE under dark conditions).  \nRewetting\/Draining \nAt the end of May 2007 (after approximately 14 weeks of measurements), the \nwater table treatments were reversed. Drainage of the saturated mesocosms was \nachieved using a siphon placed in the dip well; re-wetting of the drier mesocosms \nwas carried out by periodic watering over a 2 day period. Thereafter, CH4 and \nN2O fluxes were measured and solute samples collected daily for one week and \nthen every 2 days for a second week. \nAnalytical methods \nBoth chamber and soil atmosphere samples were analysed using a HP5890 Series \nII gas chromatograph (detection limits: CO2 < 199 ppmv, CH4 < 1.26 ppmv, N2O \n< 0.2 ppmv). Water samples were analysed for DOC and DIC on a Rosemount-\nDohrmann DC-80 total organic carbon analyser (detection range 0.1 to 4000 \nppmv), using ultraviolet oxidation and sparging with N2 to remove acidified \ninorganic carbon. NO3- and NH4+ were analysed on a dual channel CHEMLAB \ncontinuous flow colorimetric analyser (detection range NH4+-N: 0.25 to 3.0 ppmv; \nNO3-N: 0.25 to 5.0 ppmv). \nStatistical Analysis \nRepeated measures MANOVA was used when testing the significance of \nmesocosm type and water table treatment on measured variables; an interaction \nterm was also included in the model specification. ANOVA was used when \nconsidering mesocosm respiration, photosynthesis and NEE, with temperature as \n6 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \na covariate where appropriate. Quoted test results refer to Pillai\u2019s test statistic \n(Townend 2002) unless stated otherwise. Normality was assessed using the \nKolmogorov-Smirnov test (Townend 2002) and datasets adjusted, where \nappropriate, using log transformations. Temperature responses were tested using \nregression; trend lines are compared using multiple regression with temperature, \ngroup identifier (e.g. water table treatment 1 or 2 referring to high and low \nrespectively), and temperature*group as independent variables. Depending on the \nnormality of the data, correlations were carried out using either Pearson\u2019s product-\nmoment or Spearman\u2019s rank correlation (Townend 2002). Where mean values are \nquoted, the \u00b1 value that follows refers to the standard error of the mean unless \notherwise stated. Analyses were carried out in \u2018Minitab15\u2019. \nResults: \nComparison of mesocosm types\/peatland features \nThe observed differences in species composition (Fig. 2) within the mesocosms \nwas shown to be highly statistically significant using MANOVA (F = 6.36, p < \n0.01). All 3 mesocosm types had an average coverage of more than 60% moss. \nThe \u2018Sedge\/Hummock\u2019 group was dominated by grass and moss, and also \ncontained a significant amount of the sedge E. vaginatum. The \u2018Hollow\u2019 group \nwas dominated primarily by mosses and the \u2018Juncus\/Hummock\u2019 group, whilst still \nbeing dominated by moss and grass, also contained an average of 40% J. effusus \ncoverage. Small but significant differences were apparent in soil pH across \nmesocosm types; \u2018Juncus\/Hummock\u2019 4.2 \u00b1 0.1 (SD), \u2018Sedge\/Hummock\u2019 3.9 \u00b1 0.1 \n(SD), \u2018Hollow\u2019 4.0 \u00b1 0.1 (SD).  \nStatic water table treatment \nUptake\/Emissions \nMean combined plant and soil respiration across replicates during the static water \ntable portion of the study ranged from 92 to 167 \u00b5g CO2 m-2 s-1 (Table 1). \nRespiration was highest in the \u2018Sedge\/Hummock\u2019 group. In both the \n\u2018Sedge\/Hummock\u2019 and \u2018Hollow\u2019 mesocosms, respiration was higher in the low \nwater table group; no difference was observed in the \u2018Juncus\/Hummock\u2019 group. \n7 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \nAlthough the observed patterns were not statistically significant, this was \nexpected due to the low level of replication. Light response curves were used to \npredict photosynthesis at a PAR of 210 \u00b5mol m-2 s-1, the mean PAR at the \nAuchencorth field site over the measurement period (Coyle, unpublished data). \nPhotosynthesis (Table 1) was highest in the \u2018Juncus\/Hummock\u2019 mesocosms, \nfollowed by the \u2018Sedge\/Hummock\u2019 and finally the \u2018Hollow\u2019 mesocosms (F = \n5.25, p < 0.05). The effect of water table depth on photosynthesis was \ninsignificant (F = 3.68, p < 0.10); however, lower water tables indicated a 44%, \n36% and 21% decrease in photosynthesis in the \u2018Juncus\/Hummock\u2019, \n\u2018Sedge\/Hummock\u2019 and \u2018Hollow\u2019 mesocosms, respectively. The resulting NEE \ncalculated from the respiration and photosynthesis data showed no significant \neffect of either mesocosm type or water table position. However, in general the \nlower water table treatment increased the flux of CO2 to the atmosphere (Table 1). \nThe \u2018Juncus\/Hummock\u2019 mesocosms in the high water table treatment were the \nonly group to show a net CO2 uptake.  \nMean CH4 fluxes from individual chambers over the 14 week period of static \nwater table treatment ranged from -30.7 to 358 \u00b5g CH4 m-2 h-1; mean N2O fluxes \nover the same period ranged from -17.3 to 12.5 \u00b5g N2O m-2 h-1. Averages across \nchamber types and water table levels for both CH4 and N2O are presented in Table \n1. Variation in mean CH4 flux was high within all groups, and neither water table \nlevel nor mesocosm type alone had a significant effect on CH4 efflux; the effect of \nwater table was almost significant (F = 3.41, p < 0.10). However, there was a \nsignificant interaction effect (F = 1.65, p < 0.05). Only in the high water table \ngroup did mesocosm type have a significant effect on CH4 flux (Hollow > \nSedge\/Hummock > Juncus\/Hummock). A highly significant increasing trend in \nmean CH4 flux (r2 = 0.59, p < 0.01) was observed in the \u2018Sedge\/Hummock\u2019 time \nseries plot (Fig. 3). When the experiment began mean CH4 emissions from the \n\u2018Sedge\/Hummock\u2019 mesocosms were similar in magnitude to the \n\u2018Juncus\/Hummock\u2019 mesocosms; however, from early April onwards the \n\u2018Sedge\/Hummock\u2019 mesocosms were more similar to the \u2018Hollow\u2019 mesocosms. \nMean CH4 flux in all groups was positive, representing a net emission; however, \nuptake was measured at least once throughout the experiment in all but 2 of the \nmesocosms.  \n8 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \nThere was a net uptake of N2O in 21 of the 24 mesocosms over the 14 week \nperiod reflected in a net uptake across all chamber types irrespective of water \ntable (Table 1); however, variation was extremely high. No significant effect of \neither water table depth or mesocosm type on N2O flux was observed using \nPillai\u2019s MANOVA test. However, using the Lawley-Hotelling (Townend 2002) \nMANOVA post-hoc, the interaction effect was statistically significant (F = 1.72, p \n< 0.05); again mesocosm type was only important in the high water table \ntreatment.  \nBelow ground concentrations \nMean CO2 concentrations in the deep and shallow soil atmosphere wells were 764 \n\u00b1 52 and 680 \u00b1 25 ppmv respectively; mean CH4 concentrations 127 \u00b1 52 and 111 \n\u00b1 37 ppmv and mean N2O concentrations 0.38 \u00b1 0.01 and 0.37 \u00b1 0.01 ppmv \n(Table 2). Strong positive correlations were found between the deep and shallow \nwell concentrations for CO2 (r = 0.90, p < 0.01) and N2O (r = 0.93, p<0.01). \nHowever, no correlation was observed between CH4 concentrations in the deep \nand shallow wells (r = -0.10, p = 0.80). Variability in the measured CH4 \nconcentrations was large, ranging from below the detection limit to 5755 ppmv, \nsuggesting the presence of pockets of high CH4 concentrations within the peat \nprofile. No water table or mesocosm type effects were observed for CO2 or N2O \nconcentrations (Table 2). Although not statistically significant, CH4 \nconcentrations appeared to be higher in the high water table treatment. The \nhighest concentrations were observed in the \u2018Sedge\/Hummock\u2019 mesocosms, \nwhere the water table effect was also most pronounced, followed by the \n\u2018Hollows\u2019, and lastly the \u2018Juncus\/Hummock\u2019 group, where no visible difference \nwas apparent between high and low water table. \nSoil solution DOC concentrations ranged from 8.0-124 mg l-1 with a mean of 43 \u00b1 \n2.1 mg l-1. Concentrations of DIC, NO3- and NH4+ covered a much smaller range \nwith mean values of 3.61 \u00b1 0.26, 0.03 \u00b1 0.01 and 1.16 \u00b1 0.09 mg l-1 respectively. \nNo consistent patterns were observed across mesocosm type or water table \ntreatment in soil water solute concentrations.   \n9 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \nTemperature sensitivity \nBoth high and low water table groups showed a highly significant CH4 response \n(p < 0.01) to natural variations in soil temperature (Fig. 4a) during the static water \ntable period. In the high water table group CH4 emissions increased with \nincreasing temperature (r2 = 0.50); in the low water table group increasing \ntemperature led to a decrease in emissions (r2 = 0.26). The slopes of the 2 \ndifferent trend lines were significantly different (t = -4.51, p < 0.001), with a \nmuch stronger response to temperature in the high water table group. The N2O \nflux responded positively to increased soil temperature (r2 = 0.28) with no \nsignificant difference in the trend lines between water table treatments (Fig. 4b). \nThe N2O flux showed a switch from uptake to emissions between approximately \n7.5 and 8.5\u00baC.  \nThe temperature response of CH4 in the high water table treatment group, \nseparated by mesocosm type is shown in Fig. 5. The trend lines for the \n\u2018Sedge\/Hummock\u2019 (r2 = 0.62, p < 0.01) and \u2018Hollow\u2019 (r2 = 0.43, p < 0.05) \nmesocosms were offset (i.e. the \u2018Hollow\u2019 mesocosms had higher CH4 emissions) \nthough the slope of the lines (i.e. the response to increasing temperature) were \nsimilar. The slope of the \u2018Juncus\/Hummock\u2019 trend line was negligible and not \nsignificant at p < 0.05. Mesocosm type had no significant effect on CH4 response \nin the low water table treatment group. As variability around all trend lines was \ngreat and as measurements were only made over a very limited temperature range, \nit would be misleading to present Q10 values for the data.  \nResponse to draining\/rewetting \nAfter the initial 14 week static water table treatment, the water table levels in the 2 \ntreatments were switched. Over a 2 day period the high water table group was \ndrained to a new water table depth of 30-35 cm, and the low water table group \nwas wetted up until water table depth reached 0-5 cm. \nA significant and immediate pulse, raising the CH4 flux rate to over 160 \u00b5g m-2 h-1 \nabove what it was prior to rewetting, was observed in both the \u2018Hollow\u2019 and the \n\u2018Sedge\/Hummock\u2019 mesocosms; a similar, though slightly lower pulse was \nobserved a day later in the \u2018Juncus\/Hummock\u2019 mesocosms (Fig. 6a). The CH4 \nflux returned to a rate similar to its pre-change mean before rising more slowly \n10 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \nagain after approximately 8-10 days. The rate of increase in the latter stage of the \nresponse was greatest in the \u2018Sedge\/Hummock\u2019 mesocosms, followed by the \n\u2018Hollow\u2019 mesocosms; very little increase was observed in the \u2018Juncus\/Hummock\u2019 \nmesocosms. To test the significance of differences between mesocosm types, the \npost-change period was split into 3 separate time intervals; days 0-5, 5-10 and 10-\n15. Each section was analyzed independently using a repeated measures \nMANOVA test. The test confirmed the statistical significance of the differences in \nmesocosm types between days 10-15 after rewetting (F = 4.00, p < 0.01).   \nA pulse of CH4, similar to that caused by rewetting was also seen in response to \ndrainage (Fig. 6c). However, the magnitude of this pulse was approximately 700 \n\u00b5g m-2 h-1 above the pre-change mean in both the \u2018Sedge\/Hummock\u2019 and the \n\u2018Hollow\u2019 mesocosms, and more than 200 \u00b5g m-2 h-1 above the pre-change mean in \nthe \u2018Juncus\/Hummock\u2019 mesocosms; in all cases significantly higher than after \nrewetting. After ~8 days the fluxes appeared to level off at approximately -10, -70 \nand -120 \u00b5g m-2 h-1 below the pre-change mean in the \u2018Juncus\/Hummock\u2019, \n\u2018Sedge\/Hummock\u2019 and \u2018Hollow\u2019 mesocosms, respectively. The effect of \nmesocosm type on response to drainage was only significant between days 5-10 \n(F = 2.95, p < 0.05) \nIn both the rewetting and the draining treatments, peaks in the N2O response \noccurred after 2 days (Fig. 6b and d). The pulse effect occurred only in the \n\u2018Hollow\u2019 mesocosms after rewetting, and in both the \u2018Hollow\u2019 and \n\u2018Juncus\/Hummock\u2019 mesocosms after draining. After the initial pulse, all \nmesocosms, both in the rewetting and drainage treatments followed a very similar \npattern in terms of N2O response. This response showed no correlation with \ntemperature. \nSolute concentrations were also collected and analysed for DOC, DIC, NH4+ and \nNO3- during both the rewetting and draining experiments. However, no significant \nresponse to draining\/rewetting was observed. \n11 \nDiscussion: 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \nComparison between mesocosms and field conditions \nMean NEE across the different water table treatments and mesocosm types ranged \nfrom -65 to 123 \u00b5g CO2 m-2 s-1 (Table 1). During the same study period, mean \nNEE measured at the Auchencorth Moss field site using eddy covariance was -8.4 \n\u00b5g CO2 m-2 s-1 (Coyle, unpublished data). Despite the low replication, different \nconditions, and different measurement technique, the field site NEE is still within \nthe range measured here. Mean CH4 and N2O fluxes ranged from 0.19 to 191 \u00b5g \nCH4 m-2 h-1 and from -3.4 to -0.55 \u00b5g N2O m-2 h-1 (Table 1). Fortnightly field \nmeasurements over comparable vegetation types during the same period gave a \nmean CH4 and N2O flux of 9.9 \u00b1 4.1 \u00b5g CH4 m-2 h-1 and -3.3 \u00b1 1.5 \u00b5g N2O m-2 h-1 \n(Dinsmore, unpublished data); again the field mean is within the range measured \nin this study. Mean mesocosm DOC and NH4+ concentrations were approximately \ndouble the mean concentrations measured in the field. The higher DOC and NH4+ \nconcentrations in the mesocosms may indicate an increase in mineralization \ncaused by the death of plant roots cut during mesocosm collection; this may also \nexplain why our mesocosms had a net CO2 emission whilst field measurements \nover the same period showed a net uptake. DIC and NO3- concentrations were \nsimilar between field and mesocosms. In response to a number of GHGs and \nsolutes, our mesocosms therefore appear to represent field conditions relatively \nwell. \nEffect of water table depth and mesocosm type \nAlthough not statistically significant our results demonstrated that under lower \nwater table conditions respiration increased and photosynthesis decreased. This is \nconsistent with similar studies (e.g. Blodau et al. 2004; Moore and Roulet 1993), \nas water table controls the depth of the oxic peat layer, and hence the volume of \npeat where aerobic decomposition can occur (Moore and Dalva 1993; Silvola et \nal. 1996). However, the relationship between water table depth and respiration is \nnot linear throughout the profile with several authors reporting a breakdown in the \nrelationship below ~30 cm (e.g. Silvola 1996; Lafleur et al. 2005). Blodau et al. \n(2004) demonstrated a drop in photosynthesis of 24% and 42% in two different \nCanadian peatlands, associated with a 30 cm drop in water level; similarly, in this \n12 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \nstudy we measured a drop of between 21-44% with a similar water level change. \nIn mesocosms dominated by J. effusus and E. vaginatum, Str\u00f6m et al. (2005) \nmeasured mean respiration rates of 78 \u00b5g m-2 s-1 and 121 \u00b5g m-2 s-1 respectively, \nsimilar to the 100 \u00b5g m-2 s-1 and 123 \u00b5g m-2 s-1 for J. effusus and E. vaginatum in \nthis study. The response of ecosystems to water table manipulations has \npreviously been shown to be dominated primarily by processes associated with \nrespiration rather than photosynthesis (Funk et al. 1994). As such, in both this \nstudy and others (for example Blodau and Moore 2003a; Chimner and Cooper \n2003; Moore and Dalva 1993), the net effect of lowered water tables is an increase \nin CO2 flux to the atmosphere. However, despite the agreement with similar \nstudies, these results should not be directly extrapolated to predict the ecosystem \nresponse to longer-term water table draw-down. Laiho (2006) highlights the \nimportance of differentiating between \u2018wet\u2019 and \u2018dry\u2019 sites. If deeper soil layers \nare continuously exposed to aerobic decomposition, the carbon at depth becomes \nhighly recalcitrant. The associated decrease in decomposition potential is likely to \nnegate the effect of an increased aerobic zone. Several other studies have also \nargued that in \u2018dry\u2019 peats, large relative changes in respiration at depth have little \neffect on surface fluxes due to the low contribution of deeper peat to total \nrespiration (Blodau et al. 2007; Knorr et al. 2007; Lafleur et al. 2005). As the \nnatural water table regime at Auchencorth often exposes deeper layers to aerobic \nconditions it is unsurprising that the relationship found here was small and not \nstatistically significant.  \nIn accordance with previous studies (Aerts and Ludwig 1997; Moore and Dalva \n1993), we measured higher CH4 emissions in our high water table treatment. In \nthe high water table group, the effect of mesocosm type on CH4 emissions was \nhighly significant. Based on both current literature and our photosynthesis data \n(Table 1), we expected the order \u2018Juncus\/Hummock\u2019 > \u2018Sedge\/Hummock\u2019 > \n\u2018Hollow\u2019 due to the potential for plant-mediated transport and substrate release \n(Greenup et al. 2000; Shannon et al. 1996; Yu et al. 1997). In this study we found \nthe opposite to be true. Emissions were lower in the \u2018Juncus\/Hummock\u2019 and the \n\u2018Sedge\/Hummock\u2019 mesocosms, both of which contained a large proportion of \naerenchyma containing plants (J. effusus, D. flexuosa and E. vaginatum). \n13 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \nAs well as providing a transport route for CH4, aerenchyma also transports O2 into \nthe rhizosphere and can significantly alter the redox state of saturated peat, \nresulting in decreased methanogenesis and increased oxidation (Visser et al. 2000; \nWiebner et al. 2002). Lombardi et al. (1997) measured CH4 oxidation potentials \nof 44-318 mg m-2 d-1 in the rhizosphere of common aerenchymous wetland \nspecies. The amount of radial oxygen loss through the plant roots is likely to be \ndependent on photosynthetic activity (Roura-Carol and Freeman 1999). In the low \nwater table treatment group, due to the limited depth of our mesocosms, only a \nvery shallow anoxic layer for methanogenesis is likely to have existed. The \nabsence of a significant CH4 reservoir for plant roots to tap into may have \nrestricted the potential for plant-mediated transport. Although the majority of \nstudies have found a positive effect of vascular plants on CH4 emissions, a few \nhave reported results similar to this study, where emission inhibition by \nrhizospheric oxidation appears to be greater than the increase in emissions via \nplant-mediated transport and enhanced substrate release (Gr\u00fcnfeld and Brix 1999; \nKutzbach et al. 2004). Similarly Arah and Stephen (1998) found that increasing \nthe root-mediated transport potential in a CH4 flux model resulted in decreased net \nemissions due to the increase in oxidation outweighing increased CH4 transport.  \nThe increase in CH4 emissions from the \u2018Sedge\/Hummock\u2019 mesocosms \nthroughout the study period (Fig. 3) may indicate a seasonal shift in the balance of \npositive and negative effects of vascular plants on CH4 emissions. The conduit \npotential of aerenchyma containing plants is likely to increase seasonally due to \nthe relationship between root biomass and stem cross-sectional area (Arenovski \nand Howes 1992; Waddington et al. 1996). The production of deep roots reaching \nthe anoxic peat layer (Wein 1973), or increased substrate release early in the \ngrowing season (Saarnio et al. 2004), may also cause seasonal changes in plant-\nrelated emissions. The earlier initiation of E. vaginatum growth than Juncus \neffusus (Wein 1973) may explain why a similar increasing trend is not observed in \nthe \u2018Juncus\/Hummock\u2019 mesocosms. Longer-term measurements are needed to test \nthis hypothesis. \nThe pattern of below ground CH4 concentrations (\u2018Sedge\/Hummock\u2019 > \u2018Hollow\u2019) \nwas opposite to that seen in surface emissions (\u2018Hollow\u2019 > \u2018Sedge\/Hummock\u2019). \nThis suggests that although more CH4 is produced in the \u2018Sedge\/Hummock\u2019 \n14 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \nmesocosms, there is a barrier preventing soil-atmosphere transfer. This could be \neither oxidation in the rhizosphere (assuming soil atmosphere wells did not \nsample the rhizosphere), or a physical barrier such as the thick layer of hummock \nbiomass preventing diffusion across the soil-atmosphere boundary. As bubble \nformation does not occur until partial pressures of >0.21 atm (Fechner-Levy and \nHemond 1996), this is unlikely to be important in our mesocosms. The extremely \nhigh variability in soil-atmosphere CH4 concentrations and the lack of correlation \nbetween shallow and deep wells may indicate spatial heterogeneity in rates of \nproduction and oxidation within the soil profile caused by plant roots. High \nconcentrations in the Sedge\/Hummock mesocosms may also be due to substrate \navailability. E. vaginatum has previously been shown to release much higher \nquantities of acetate, a substrate of major importance to CH4 production, than J. \neffusus (Str\u00f6m et al. 2005). \nRelatively few conclusions can be drawn from the pattern of N2O fluxes and \nconcentrations due to the very high temporal variability. Low NO3- concentrations \nin soil water may indicate low nitrification rates. An increased rate of nitrification \nhas been observed after water-table drawdown in several studies (Neill 1995; \nRegina et al. 1996). Similarly in this study, although not significant, \nconcentrations of NO3- were higher in the low water table treatment in both \n\u2018Sedge\/Hummock\u2019 and \u2018Hollow\u2019 mesocosms. Alternatively, the low NO3- pool \nmay be a consequence of high turnover rates. N2O consumption from complete \ndenitrification may be the dominant process controlling N2O fluxes to and from \nthis system.   \nTemperature response \nThe clear difference in the temperature response of CH4 emissions between the \nhigh and low water table groups (Fig. 4) was likely a result of different processes \ncontributing to the net flux. In anoxic (high water table) conditions the dominant \nprocess was methanogenesis which increases emissions as microbial activity \nincreases in response to increasing temperature. This is in agreement with \nprevious studies which show a stronger temperature response in methanogenesis \nthan methanotrophy (Dunfield et al. 1993). In oxic (low water table) conditions \nmethanotrophy as well as methanogenesis contributed to the net flux, dampening \nthe overall response. The responses of both the \u2018Hollow\u2019 and the \n15 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n\u2018Sedge\/Hummock\u2019 mesocosms were similar, suggesting a common dominant \nprocess (methanogenesis). The \u2018Juncus\/Hummock\u2019 however, more closely \nresembled the response of the low water table group, indicating that \nmethanotrophy was also important. This supports the assertion that rhizospheric \noxidation was important in the \u2018Juncus\/Hummock\u2019 mesocosms. The temperature \nresponses here appeared to be linear compared to the exponential responses \nobserved in other studies (Dise et al. 1993; MacDonald et al. 1998).  However, \nthis may simply be a consequence of the limited range of temperatures our \nmesocosms were exposed to. \nWe found a positive linear response of N2O emissions to temperature with a \nswitch from consumption to production between approximately 7.5 and 8.5\u00baC. \nThis suggests that N2O producing processes are more responsive to temperature \nthan N2O consumption processes. Water table position had no effect on the \nmagnitude of the N2O temperature response. Further work is required to assess the \nvalidity of the observed switch from consumption to production as N2O fluxes in \nthis study are low and variability high. \nPulsing effect \nAfter switching water table positions, both drainage and rewetting produced \nevidence of a significant pulse in CH4 and N2O emissions within 1 or 2 days. This \npulse may be the direct result of the physical disturbance (water table shift) \ncausing a release of CH4 and N2O from below ground reservoirs. Episodic pulsing \nafter water table drawdown was seen by both Moore et al. (1990) and Shurpali et \nal. (1993) and was attributed to degassing due to reduced hydrostatic pressure. \nAlternatively, pulses may be a biological response to increased substrate \navailability from enhanced biomass recycling or redox-induced chemical \nbreakdown (Blodau and Moore 2003b). Similar pulses in mineralization rates \nhave been observed in response to water level fluctuations (Aerts and Ludwig \n1997). After the initial pulse, the CH4 response to drainage occurred faster than \nthe response to rewetting. This is consistent with previous studies (Whalen and \nReeburgh 2000). N2O fluxes were similar across all mesocosm types and water \ntable positions.  \n16 \nImplications 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \nFrom continuous water table measurements made at the Auchencorth Moss \npeatland in 2007 (Coyle, unpublished data), a rise in water table by more than 20 \ncm in less than 48 hours occurred 9 times in 8 months. Assuming emissions in \nboth CH4 and N2O peak each time this occurs and the peak lasts approximately 24 \nhours, fortnightly field measurements may fail to capture these peaks. The results \nfrom the mesocosm study suggest that CH4 pulsing after rewetting could \npotentially contribute an additional 16% to the average annual flux. Using the \nsame assumptions, net N2O flux could switch from a net sink of 0.008 to a net \nsource of 0.02 \u00b5g m-2 h-1 (Dinsmore et al., unpublished data, 2008). Although this \nis only a rough calculation and the assumptions are large, it illustrates the \npotential importance of these emission pulses after a sudden rise in field water \ntable levels. No such calculation was carried out on the pulses observed after \ndrainage as it is extremely unlikely that a water table drop of this magnitude \nwould occur over only 2 days in the field. Further work is required to assess the \nactual implications of this pulsing under natural field conditions.   \nUsing the 100 year global warming potentials published by the IPCC (2007), the \nGHG fluxes in CO2 equivalents for each group of mesocosms was calculated \n(Table 3). In this system, CO2 fluxes dominate the budget entirely. CH4 fluxes are \nan order of magnitude smaller than in many studies (e.g. Dowrick et al. 2006; \nHargreaves and Fowler 1998; Minkkinen et al. 2002; Minkkinen and Laine 2006; \nRoulet et al. 2007), though studies such as MacDonald et al (1998) found similar \nvalues in Scottish blanket peats. Fluxes of CO2-equivalents from N2O are in the \nsame order of magnitude as CO2-equivalents from CH4. Lowering the water table \nby 30 cm greatly increased the net flux of CO2-equivalents to the atmosphere, \nwhich was dominated by NEE. Of the different mesocosm types, only the J. \neffusus dominated hummocks show a net uptake of CO2-equivalents. Hence it is \nimportant to accurately account for the relative proportions of each community \ntype when up-scaling chamber measurements made in the field.   \nConclusions:  \nOur results agree with previous studies on the flux responses to low water table \nconditions. We have also demonstrated the strong interaction between water table \n17 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \ndepth and vegetation. The effect of vegetation within the mesocosms was counter \nto what we had originally hypothesised based on the available literature. What \ndetermines the ratio between flux enhancing and flux inhibiting mechanisms in \nplant communities is still largely unclear and may be related to both site-specific \nand species-specific variables, which may change seasonally with plant growth \nstage. Despite the uncertainty in the mechanisms involved, it is clear that species \ncomposition has a dramatic effect on ecosystem functioning, and as such it is \nimportant that community type is considered when up-scaling chamber \nmeasurements. It also highlights the need to include some form of vegetation \nsuccession in models used to predict long-term effects of landscape management \nand environmental change on GHG budgets.  \nWe observed a pulse in both CH4 and N2O emissions occurring between 1-2 days \nafter manually changing the depth of the water table by \u00b1 30 cm. Though further \nwork is required to quantify the importance of this pulse under field conditions, it \ncan be concluded that low frequency chamber measurements may significantly \nunderestimate mean annual emissions.  \nAcknowledgements \nWe thank Frank Harvey and the staff at CEH Edinburgh for their help and advice throughout the \nstudy, and John Parker (Scottish Agricultural College) for his help with laboratory work.
