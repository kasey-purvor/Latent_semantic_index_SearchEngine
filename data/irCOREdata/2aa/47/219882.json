However, there is little \nawareness that we, in the U.S. and Western Europe, are also the other of others \u2013 \nespecially in today's global media environment, where we become increasingly the \nobjects of others' gaze. Roger Silverstone (2007: 172), albeit briefly, acknowledges that \nother storytellers than ourselves tell our stories, and that \u201chow we are seen and \nunderstood by those far removed from us also matters\u201d. I argue that we should extend \nour concern with proper distance in the contemporary mediated environment beyond \nour relationship to the other, to include how we are seen and understood by the other, \nand how this influences our self-understanding.  \n \nWhat happens when others tell our story, when we see how far-away-others see us? \nThis paper discusses how, and with what consequences, the media in today\u2019s \nincreasingly global and porous environment tell us about ourselves, showing us images \nand stories that are often uncomfortable, strange and disturbing. In particular, it \nexamines how the news media, in narrating and imaging \u2018us\u2019 as a nation can contribute \nto an ethical project of estrangement: achieving distance from ourselves, seeing \nourselves as others. The discussion explores the ways in which the aesthetics of news \ncan be mobilized for estrangement, what incentives news organizations might have for \npromoting an ethics of estrangement, and the opportunities and dangers this project \nentails. \n \nThis exploration shows how Silverstone\u2019s concept of proper distance may play out in \ndifferent situations of news coverage of conflict, especially when there is a tension \nbetween national and international reporting. Empirically, the analysis is based on a \ncomparison of two cases: the coverage of the 2005 riots in France and the coverage of \n2008\/9 Gaza war in Israel. France and Israel are deliberately very different cases: the \ncountries are characterized by distinctively different political systems and cultures, \noccupy very different positions in the international scene, and exist in fundamentally \ndifferent historical points in relation to their involvement in conflict, peace and war. At \n 2 \nthe same time, despite the fundamental differences between these two countries, the \nanalysis reveals that there are important similarities in how these two nations exercise \nself-distancing, and in how the mediation of this distance is manifested. Thus, these \ncases raise similar questions about proper distance, and news coverage of conflict and \nsuffering.  \n \nEstrangement  \nConcern with the mobilization of aesthetics for an ethical project centred on the \ncultivation of distance from the self evokes the concept of estrangement. The Russian \nFormalist, Victor Shklovsky, coined the term estrangement (ostranenie) to describe a \nprocess or act that endows an object or image with strangeness; the replacement of the \nfamiliar with the strange. The familiar often becomes habitual that is seen and \narticulated in an automatic way and the commonplace, thus, tends to become invisible. \nFamiliarity, Shklovsky (1990 [1925]) writes, breeds a particular form of blindness. \nEstrangement is thus the act of de-familiarization, which, to use Shklovsky\u2019s (1990: 6) \nwords, brings out the \u201cstoneness of the stone\u201d, makes \u201cone\u2019s wife more loveable, and \nwar more terrifying\u201d. It makes us aware of what is often taken for granted and goes \nunnoticed.  \nShklovsky explored the act of estrangement in literature; many of his examples refer to \nthe works of Tolstoy. From his reading of Tolstoy\u2019s story, Kholstomer, Shklovsky \noffers some useful insights into how estrangement works as an aesthetic technique. The \nnarrator, Kholstomer, is a horse. The horse\u2019s point of view makes the things he reflects \nupon appear strange and unfamiliar to the reader. For example, it de-familiarizes \nreaders from commonsensical understanding of the institution of ownership and private \nproperty. The horse makes the observation that (Tolstoy, 1861: 241):    \nThere are people who call land theirs, and have never seen their land, and have \nnever been on it. There are men who call other people theirs, but have never \nseen these people; and the whole relationship of these owners, to these people, \nconsists in doing them harm. ... Herein lies the substantial difference between \nmen and us. And therefore, not speaking of other things where we are superior \nto men, we are able boldly to say that in this one respect at least we stand, in the \n 3 \nscale of living beings, higher than men. The activity of men \u2013 at all events, of \nthose with whom I have had to do \u2013 is guided by words; ours by deeds.  \nEstrangement, however, is not just an artistic technique; it can be seen to be an ethical \nprinciple. Deanne Bogdan (1992: 180), in her critique of literary education, argues that \nestrangement \u201cclarifies values by destabilizing ordinary existence - the making strange \nof reality \u2026 opens minds and imaginations by decentering consciousness\u201d. Richard \nSennett (1994: 374) highlights the fundamental link between self-estrangement \u2013 the \notherness of ourselves \u2013 and our relationship to the \u2018other\u2019: \u201cFor without a disturbed \nsense of ourselves\u201d, he asks, \u201cwhat will prompt most of us\u2026to turn outward toward \neach other, to experience the Other?\u201d That is, the opacity of the self to itself, the sense \nof the self as stranger to itself, is the basis for recognising social differences, interest in \nthe other, and a sense of compassion and care for others\u2019 suffering.1 Paul Gilroy (2004: \n78) underlines the principled and methodological cultivation of a degree of \nestrangement from one\u2019s own culture, history and local civilization as an essential \nethical project, especially in a turbulent political climate. He includes the important \ncaveat that estrangement \u201ccannot guarantee undistorted perception of the world\u201d, but \nargues that it \u201ccan still be used to show where overfamiliarity enters and taken-for-\ngrantedness corrupts\u201d.  \nThe ethical project of estrangement is closely associated with art and literature, as \nmanifested in the literary works of writers such as Tolstoy and Brecht, and artists such \nas Dada, Magritte, Duchamp and Richter (notwithstanding the huge differences in their \napproaches and traditions). Similarly, contemporary intellectuals often act as \nestrangers. The nation, in particular, emerges as a central object of estrangement, for \nexample, in the reflections of the 20th century modern intellectuals who were refugees \nfrom Nazism dissatisfied with patriotism and nationalism (Gilroy, 2004).  \nBut estrangement is not and should not be the privilege of elites. Gilroy draws attention \nto the potential of the media as symbolic space for estrangement in his discussion of the \nsatirical television show (later a film) Ali G. Through the employment of artistic \ntechniques, the character Ali G becomes a stranger (a non-black, suburban male who \nrevels in a mixture of American Gangsta Rap and Jamaican culture) whose strangeness \nis educative. The satiricism of Ali G's performance estranges viewers from entrenched \nnotions of Britishness and opens up different ways to imagine identities and cultures. \n 4 \nSatire, more generally, is an estranging genre; it disrupts the familiar and \ncommonsensical through the use of wit and ridicule, in order to create a reflexive space \nto question taken for granted understandings and moral standards. \nCan the contemporary mediated space provide resources for estrangement beyond such \n\u2018designated\u2019 genres as satire, and for wider audiences? I suggest that news (in its \nmultiple contemporary forms and formations) is an interesting and important space \nwhere estrangement emerges and can be productively cultivated. However, there is an \ninherent tension between news and estrangement. News is determined by its highly \nformulaic, repetitive and habitual form and concurrently symbolizes routine, the \nfamiliar, the habitual, while estrangement is geared towards the disruption of the \nfamiliar and taken-for-granted. How and why can such a contradiction become morally \nproductive? How can and should estrangement be cultivated in news? These questions \nare at the heart of the discussion that follows.    \nEstrangement in the News \nConsiderable attention has been paid to the significant role that news, especially \nnational news, plays in reassuring communities and societies, providing ontological \nsecurity and a sense of coherence. Silverstone (1994; 1999; 2005) and many others (e.g. \nDayan and Katz, 1992; Scannel and Cardiff, 1991; Billig, 1995) explored this \ndimension. In all this work, the news figures largely in the Durkheimian sense, as the \nembodiment of the projection of the community ideal, which creates a symbolic order \nthat operates to provide confirmation and control. The value of news is seen as lying in \nthe \u201cpresentation of reality that gives life an overall form, order, and tone\u201d (Carey, \n1992: 21). Communication more broadly, is viewed as being directed towards the \nmaintenance of society in time and the representation of shared beliefs. Thus, in this \nmodel, news is tied closely to the provision of reassurance by creating and sustaining \nproximity: the emphasis is on how the news creates and reproduces the familiar, the \nordinary, the ordered and, implicitly, the proximate. Studies of the construction of \nnational identity in the news reflect this theoretical orientation vividly. Analysing news \nas a genre, a form, a text, symbolic content or discourse, studies show how the news \nparticipates in the symbolic production and reproduction of the national imagined \ncommunity as the unit readers and viewers are called on to relate to and to identify \nwith. Even when the news is shown to offer reflections on disturbances to our world, \n 5 \nthe notion is that the construction of reality is, or should be directed towards, creating \nand sustaining reassurance.  \n               \nHowever news plays an equally important, both sociological and moral role, in evoking \ndistance, disturbing order, making a nation a stranger to itself. Anthony Cohen (1995, \ncited in Silverstone, 2005) argues that sociologically, community is claimed through \nrefraction and through moments of symbolic reversal, as much as through activities and \nrepresentations that present values, ideas and beliefs as being unproblematically shared. \nThus, it is precisely because of the ritualistic orientation of the news towards the \nconstruction and maintenance of a shared meaningful cultural world and a form of \nbeing together, that it has a fundamental role of creating and nourishing distance. In this \ncontext, Simmel\u2019s (1971 [1908]: 144) observation on the stranger (which I return to \nlater) is extremely evocative: \u201cfactors of repulsion and distance work to create a form of \nbeing together, a form of union based on interaction\u201d.  \n \nMorally, because of its \u2018dailiness\u2019 and its epistemological claim to be reporting \u2018the \nworld\u2019, the news is a primary resource that feeds our moral judgments and cultivates \nour capacity to act morally. This work of moral education (Chouliaraki, 2008) centres \non the constant production and reproduction of the distinctions between us and them, \nsameness and otherness \u2013 what Silverstone (2007: 19) calls \u201cboundary work\u201d. While \nmuch discussion in current research and public discourse focuses on the moral \nimplications of the symbolic production of others, the production of ourselves as others \n\u2013 estrangement - is a profound dimension of the media\u2019s moral work which has been \nlargely overlooked.  \n \nI now want to examine how the news acts like Shklovsky\u2019s horse: becomes the foreign \noutsider that tells \u2018our\u2019 story and cultivates a degree of estrangement, which, I would \nargue, is vital for interacting with others and for knowing and experiencing the world in \nmore complex, inclusive and moral ways. I analyse the emergence of estrangement in \ntwo cases of national conflict reporting: international coverage of the 2005 riots in \nFrance, and Israeli media coverage of the 2008\/9 Gaza war. National conflicts provide \nproductive contexts to think about the media\u2019s role in cultivating estrangement, because \nthey usually give rise to heightened attachment \u2013 the conceptual opposite of \nestrangement. That is, conflict usually promotes intensified ideological and moral \n 6 \nproximity to, and identification with, the nation.2 And yet the contemporary global, \nhighly porous and competitive media environment has made it almost impossible to \ncontain and control images and stories that disturb national narratives and nationalist \nsentiments, even, and perhaps especially, during times of conflict.  \n \nAt the same time, the countries I compare are characterized by very different political \nsystems and cultures, and histories of peace and war, which massively influence \ndegrees of distance and the expression of estrangement within their societies. France\u2019s \nhistory as an Empire, its political system and culture, and the multicultural composition \nof French society suggest that expressions of distance of the nation from itself would be \npractised and would be more legitimated than in Israel. Yet as the analysis shows, the \nveneer of openness and cosmopolitanism often gives way to articulations of defensive \nnationalism which block estrangement. Israel is a society in a state of ongoing conflict, \nlargely mobilized towards the nationalist goal of defending its existence. This situation \ncontinuously produces and legitimates overt expressions of nationalism, prohibits self-\ndistance and blocks possibilities for estrangement and self-irony. Nevertheless, \nglimpses of estrangement emerge, despite the overall stubborn denial of alternative \npoints of view, and the continuous legitimation of a dominant narrative of \u201cour\u201d truth.     \n \nThe analysis of each case highlights ways in which the aesthetics of news can be \nmobilized for the ethical project of estrangement. It explores visual and discursive \nmodes in the news coverage of two events that disrupt familiar, national narratives and \nendow them with strangeness. In addition, I examine public reactions to international \nnews coverage of the French riots and Israeli media coverage of the Gaza war, to reflect \non the possibilities that estrangement opens up, and dangers and explosiveness it \nentails.  \n \nOn Horses and Strangers  \nThe first case I examine, of international news coverage of the 2005 French urban riots, \nis an example of the foreign outsider \u2013 Tolstoy\u2019s horse \u2013 disclosing to the French nation \na different story from the one governing national screens. The second case, of Israeli \nmedia coverage of the 2008\/9 Gaza war, focuses on estrangement promoted by the \nnational media, which unlike international media, are members of the group they are \n 7 \nreporting on and to. Thus, they occupy a complex position, which suggests that they \nmay not be able to take on the role \u2013 at least not as comfortably as can the international \nmedia \u2013 of Tolstoy\u2019s horse. This problematique suggests that rather than Tolstoy\u2019s \nhorse, the Israeli media (and national media more generally) could be conceived of as \nthe Simmelian stranger - who is both \u201cnear and far at the same time\u201d (Simmel, 1971: \n148). I show that the Israeli media act (albeit in continuous tension with their strong \nattachment to the nation) like Simmel\u2019s stranger. While a distinction between the roles \nof horse and stranger is important, the focus of my argument is on what these positions \njointly contribute to thinking about the news and contemporary media as agents of \nestrangement.3         \n \nAdmittedly, the actual viewing of international news channels in France and Israel is \nrelatively low. However, as the analyses show, international coverage still has \nsignificant influence in these countries. The question of \u201chow the world sees us\u201d is \ninherent in the political culture of such small-medium sized countries. Indeed, as \nmanifested in the reporting of international news, this question was repeatedly \ndiscussed in the national media during and after the conflicts. In the French case, the \nnational press, television and blogsphere made ongoing references to international news \nreporting. In Israel, the two main television channels incorporated into their reporting \nexcerpts from international coverage, and discussed it frequently. Thus to explore the \nsymbolic production of estrangement, the analyses focus on how international news \ncoverage of the French riots and the Gaza war was understood and received in the \npublic sphere in France and Israel respectively. \n \nFrom the Horse\u2019s Mouth:  \nInternational News Coverage of the 2005 French Riots   \nThe urban riots erupted in October 2005 and were a vivid instance of France becoming \nthe object of the world\u2019s gaze. On the night of 27 October youths in Clichy-sous-Bois \nbegan torching cars and stoning the police to express their anger at the death of two \nteenagers of Maghrebi descent, who were electrocuted at a police sub-station in the \nsuburb. The riots escalated rapidly, fuelled by the claims being made by Nicholas \nSarkozy, the then Minister of the Interior; curfews were put in force in the suburbs of \nParis and some 40 other French towns and cities. After 22 days of rioting involving the \n 8 \ndestruction of 9,000 vehicles, 2,921 people taken in for questioning and 126 gendarmes \ninjured, the police announced a \u2018return to normal\u2019. The curfews were finally lifted on 4 \nJanuary 2006.   \nThe international media honed in on the riots: their news channels, including CNN \nInternational, BBC World and Bloomberg, provided 24-hour coverage with special \ncorrespondents reporting live from the banlieues, France\u2019s impoverished suburbs \ninhabited mainly by minority ethnic groups, where the rioting had begun. Images of \nburnt-out vehicles were transmitted under headlines such as CNN\u2019s \u2018Paris in flames\u2019, \nand Fox News headline banner \u2018Paris Burning\u2019.4 The mainstream French media, e.g. \nFrance's leading commercial TV station LCI and the state-run channel France 3, were \nmore restrained about the images they broadcast - partly as a response to what they saw \nas the international media\u2019s exaggeration and sensationalism. They tended to portray \nthe unrest as a \u201clocal problem\u201d, seeing their role, in the words of the Director General \nof LCI, as contributing to \u201cmaintaining law and order\u201d (News Xchange, 2005). But it \nwas impossible to control, contain and ignore the images of violence in the banlieues \nthat were being broadcast: the \u201clocal problem\u201d was being projected onto the \ninternational stage.   \n \nDebates in the French press and the blogsphere provide useful entry points to \nunderstanding how estrangement works: how notions of national identity are articulated \nand how distance from the national unit is negotiated in response to and in light of the \nstories that others tell about the nation. Data on the public debate in France cover \narticles from major newspapers and press agencies during the six-months following the \nriots. I used Lexis Nexis news database to search articles published in Le Monde, Le \nFigaro, Lib\u00e9ration, Les Echos, Agence France Presse, using the search terms \u2018\u00e9meutes\u2019 \n(riots) AND 't\u00e9l\u00e9vision\u2019 (television) OR \u2018m\u00e9dias etrang\u00e8res\u2019 OR \u2018m\u00e9dias \u00e9trangers\u2019 OR \n\u2018presse etrang\u00e8re\u2019 (foreign media in plural OR foreign media in singular OR foreign \npress) OR \u2018m\u00e9dias internationales\u2019 (international media) OR \u2018t\u00e9l\u00e9vision satellite\u2019 \n(satellite television). I used .fr Google Blog Search and various combinations of these \nsearch terms to explore French blogs. For secondary data, I searched transcripts of \nprogrammes aired on CNN and BBC, and reviewed the English language literature on \nthe media\u2019s role in the events.   \n \n 9 \nThe international media largely acted like Tolstoy\u2019s horse: they presented a point of \nview that made the images and narratives being displayed to French viewers strange \nand unfamiliar. Three ways in which international news channels\u2019 coverage promoted \nestrangement merit attention.  \n \nFirst, the sheer volume of coverage and the immediacy with which it was produced and \ndisseminated on international news channels, contributed to a considerable de-\nfamiliarization of the events. The French sociologist, Erwan Lecouer (in Bennhold, \n2006), describes how the French public \u201chave long become accustomed to sporadic \noutbreaks of vandalism and violence in suburban housing projects across the country\u201d. \nHence, the \u201cwidespread French incomprehension and outrage\u201d at the riots receiving \nsuch wide coverage in so many countries. When events that traditionally receive limited \ncoverage at home are exposed to the world and delivered with the immediacy and a \nsense of urgency engendered by the 24-hour rhythm of global news networks, their \n\u2018normality\u2019 and taken-for-granted character are undermined.  \n \nA second aesthetic technique that generated estrangement was the removal of \nuniqueness and the politicization of the riots. Estrangement is wont to set in when the \nfeeling of uniqueness is replaced by generalization (Simmel, 1971) \u2013 a sense that what \nwe are experiencing here and now, could have happened or has happened to others, \nthen and there. The uniqueness of the banlieues riots became questionable because of \nthe analogies made, especially to wars and ethnic conflicts. The international media \nmade comparisons with the Iraq war (e.g. CNN and Fox news), the Palestinian Intifada \n(Al Jazeera and TV 5, a joint-venture among francophone public broadcasters from \nacross Europe and Quebec) and Apartheid in South Africa (Al Jazeera). These \nanalogies carry a heavy ideological and politicized baggage of racism, oppression and \nwar. Use of these comparisons removes the riots from styles of presentation and \nrhetoric of crime and order and recontextualizes them in a political-ideological frame. \nIn this political frame, the French government becomes the offender and the \nparticipants in the violence the victims. The unrest in the banlieues hitherto presented in \nthe French media as a violent expression of an ethnic minority is reframed as a political \nstruggle targeted against oppression and racism exercised by the political powers in \nFrance. In a similar vein, the appearance of emblematic CNN war reporter Christiane \nAmanpour reporting from the banlieues against a backdrop of burning cars, radically \n 10 \nreframes the riots - from events with which French viewers are familiar, and commonly \nunderstand within an explanatory framework of domestic crime and order, to a violent \npolitical conflict of international significance.  \n \nEvidently, these comparisons exploded into passionate debate in the French public \nsphere (see Orgad, 2008). Whether commentators agreed with or rejected these \ncomparisons, the analogies made opened up a reflexive space for thinking anew about \nthe riots, and the French model of social integration more generally.  \n \nA third way in which the international news media promoted estrangement was by \nproviding the people from the banlieues with a stage, giving voices to people long \nexcluded from the French national media and public sphere (Harding, 2006; Bourdais, \n2004). Once the banlieues residents had gained some visibility on international news \nchannels, the French television channels began to include them in their reporting. \nFrench blogs5 written during and after the riots, and commentaries in the French press \n(e.g. Richebois, 2005) reflect a sense of pride at the emergence of voices silenced and \ndenied for years. Jeff Jarvis (2005) goes so far as to describe their impact as \u201cthe \nstorming of the media Bastille\u201d. Notwithstanding this over-celebratory tone, Jarvis \nhighlights the role played by the blogsphere and international news channels in \nlegitimizing the inhabitants of the banlieues and showing that these minorities, who \nwere absent from French television screens, could no longer be kept invisible.  \n \nThe appearance of banlieues residents on television and Internet screens is reminiscent \nof Usbek and Ibben \u2013 the two Persian travellers in Montesquieu\u2019s (1923) satirical novel \nPersian Letters. The novel centres on Usbek and Ibben\u2019s experience of travelling into \nthe metropolitan centre of France under the ancien regime, where, removed from their \nplace of origin and belonging, they observe European and Christian habits in the \ncontested heart of Europe\u2019s emergent public world. Gilroy (2004: 78) observes how the \nexperiences of Montesquieu\u2019s travellers \u201cestablish that being a stranger can be \ninvaluable as an opportunity to know the world better and to experience it in more \ncomplex and satisfying forms\u201d. The anthropological gaze of a stranger from the point of \nview of the travellers aims \u201cto reintroduce France to itself and to suggest that critical \nknowledge of one\u2019s own culture and society can only arise from a carefully cultivated \ndegree of estrangement\u201d (ibid.).  \n 11 \n \nLike Montesquieu\u2019s imaginary alien visitors offering critical commentary on modern \nmetropolitan life, the banlieues youth on international news bulletins and online spaces \ngave French viewers a critical anthropology of their own society. They endowed \ncommonsensical (and therefore largely unquestioned) conceptions of \u2018us\u2019 and \u2018them\u2019 \nwith strangeness. The media opened the gate to other perceptions: the visibility of the \nbanlieues residents in the media acted as a catalyst for a reflection on and rethinking \nnot only of the immediate issue \u2013 the deaths of the two youths that provoked the revolts \n- and their solution, but also of French society and its relationship with these \nmarginalized groups, the processes and mechanisms of this marginalization, and the \nurgent need to challenge them. They reintroduced France to itself \u2013 a process that \ntriggered changes in media regulation policy in France, which I discuss later.  \n \nAn article published in Les Echos describes France following the events as \u201ca France \nthat doubts herself\u201d (Hubert-Rodier 2005, my translation). This neatly captures that \nsense of a nation\u2019s opacity to itself, triggered by, among other things, the considerable \ndiscrepancy between the volume of coverage and the way that events were covered by \nthe French and international media, and the international criticism that was levelled \nagainst France. Estrangement emerges precisely from and through this sense of the self \nas stranger to itself, and through feelings of self-doubt, disturbance, incomprehension \nand shock. \n \nThe Stranger:  \nStrangeness and Distance in the Israeli Media Coverage of the Gaza War  \nThe international media are not bound through established or symbolic ties to the \nnational community on which they report. They can make the nation strange, \nsometimes radically so, to itself. National media, on the other hand, are members of the \nnational group on which and to which they are reporting and thus occupy a much more \ncomplex position. They are the stranger \u201cwho comes today and stays tomorrow \u2013 the \npotential wanderer, so to speak, who, although he [sic.] has gone no further, he [sic.] \nhas not quite got over the freedom of coming and going\u201d (Simmel, 1971: 143). The \nposition of the stranger is one of proximity and distance at the same time \u2013 resonating \nwith Silverstone\u2019s (2007: 48) notion of proper distance as that which is \u201cboth close and \nfar\u201d. \n 12 \n \nOn the one hand, a degree of closeness to and identification with the reporter\u2019s national \ncommunity is inevitable and perhaps expected and acceptable; it could be argued that it \nis necessary for audiences to be able to trust the reporting of a war in which their \ncountry is involved. On the other hand, it is expected that journalists will maintain \nsome fundamental distance from the events they report and sustain freedom. The \nstranger\u2019s freedom, Simmel (1971: 146) writes, permits him \u201cto experience and treat \neven his close relationships as though from a bird\u2019s-eye view.\u201d   \n \nThe 2008\/9 Gaza war is a fascinating case for elucidating the complexity of this \nsynthetic position required from national media as the stranger - standing \nsimultaneously close to and far from the nation. On 19 June, Israel and Hamas agreed \nto a period of calm, a Tahadiyeh. When the agreement expired Hamas resumed its \nrocket attacks on villages and towns in Southern Israel. Israel responded, on Saturday, \n27 December, with operation Cast Lead - the most ferocious attack on the Gaza Strip \nsince the beginning of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The onslaught began with two \nphases of ongoing air strikes in the first week, followed in the second week by a ground \noffensive. Hamas, meanwhile, retaliated by escalating its rocket attacks on Israel, \nhitting major cities, such as Beer Sheva and Ashdod\u2014only 20 km from Tel-Aviv. 13 \nIsraelis and over 1,300 Palestinians (many of them children) were killed. On Saturday, \n17 January, the Israeli government decided to adopt a unilateral cease fire, maintaining \ndeployment of its army in the Gaza Strip. On 18 January, Hamas reciprocated, \ndemanding withdrawal of Israel\u2019s forces from the Gaza Strip within a week (Aran, \n2009). \n \nFor the first 12 days of the war, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) banned correspondents \nfrom crossing into the Gaza strip, defying a Supreme Court order to let in a pool of \nreporters. The reporters were confined to a designated hill overlooking the territory, \naway from the fighting \u2013 a decision that angered and frustrated international news \norganizations. While Reuters, AP, Al Jazeera and BBC (whose reporters were in the \nGaza strip before the war started), were able to send out some picture, the major \nnetworks mostly were left pacing the Israeli side of the border. Unlike international \njournalists, Israeli reporters were used to covering Gaza from a distance: since 2006 \nthey had been forbidden by law from entering the territory. The Israeli media operated \n 13 \nin an uncommonly bizarre situation of forced alienation and distance: the media ban \nconstituted Gaza and its Palestinian population as a far away Other, who cannot and \nshould not be known directly. This, in Silverstone\u2019s terms, is an ultimate manifestation \nof the \u2018too far\u2019: distancing and annihilation of the Other, beyond access, recognition \nand understanding.               \n \nThe ban on entering Gaza, which throughout the war extended to the international \nmedia, to a large extent was a reaction to Israel\u2019s experience of the 2006 Lebanon war \nagainst Hezbollah when the media had nearly unfettered access to the front lines. Then, \nthe networks continuously projected pictures in real time from the battlefield. In the \nheated public debate during and after the war in Israel, it was claimed that this helped \nHezbollah and destabilized home front morale. It is therefore perhaps unsurprising that \nIDF\u2019s decision to ban access of the media to Gaza was generally not disputed by the \nIsraeli public and reporters, despite the frustration, anger and international criticism it \ngenerated. For the Israeli public (although clearly not a singular entity) the national \nmedia coverage of the 2006 Lebanon war was \u201ctoo far\u201d: national reporters were \naccused of being too distanced from their own community. The Gaza war was an \nopportunity for the national media to correct this \u2018improper\u2019 distance, to regain the \npublic\u2019s trust. Israeli media coverage was characterized by strong tendencies of \nattachment: articulations of self-righteousness and support for the military action (for a \ndetailed analysis, see Orgad 2009; Keshev, 2008, 2009a, 2009b).  \n \nNevertheless, even within a political atmosphere characterized largely by attachment \nand entrenchment in nationalistic scripts, and at an enforced distance from the other \n(prohibited from access to Gaza), estrangement emerges. An important source of \ndefamiliarization with and distancing from national narratives comes from the ongoing \nencounter with international media coverage, seen to represent \u201cwhat the world says\u201d. \nDiscussions in the mainstream Israeli media, both during and after the end of the war, \nincluded ongoing references to international coverage of the war, with footage from \ninternational news networks often incorporated and replayed. I next analyse the \nreporting on the two Israeli commercial television channels that enjoy the largest \nviewership (Channel 2 and Channel 10) from the beginning of the war (27 December \n2008) until two days after the ceasefire came into effect (19 January 2009). I focus only \non reports6 that make reference to the international coverage, but this is not to suggest \n 14 \nthat estrangement does not emerge in other reports, nor does it imply that it simply or \nnecessarily depends on knowledge and the use of images and accounts of international \ncoverage.  \n \nI identify three ways in which estrangement emerged in the coverage. The analysis \nfocuses on the visual and discursive elements that help to evoke distance, and their \ntension and conflict with elements that reinforce attachment. In the majority of the \nreports this tension is suppressed because the estrangement is blocked. Only a very few \nretain this unresolved friction between attachment and estrangement; which, I suggest, \nis where proper distance \u2013 both near and far - is enabled. I show how this tension is \nmanifested in the analysis of the final example and explain why it is productive.   \n \nThe removal of uniqueness is evident in Israeli media coverage. As in the French case, \nthis was achieved through the use of analogies. For example, the shelling of the UN \nschool in the Jabaliya refugee camp on 6 January, which according to UN reports killed \n43 Palestinian civilians including many children, and which was roundly condemned by \nthe international community, was compared to the tragic Qana event in the 2006 \nLebanon war, which has disturbing connotations for Israeli consciousness. \u201cAn event \nthat turned Israel from a state operating its army to a war criminal,\u201d declares Channel \n10\u2019s reporter Ilan Goren in the voiceover accompanying pictures from the Qana footage \nof weeping Lebanese women and dead children evacuated from the rubbles.  \n \nHowever, more powerful than the use of analogies, a discursive technique that \nchallenges the framing of the war as unique and idiosyncratic (and therefore justified: \nyou cannot compare it to anything else), is the use of vocabulary that is fundamentally \nmore dramatic than the language normally used by the Israeli media. This was most \nevident after UN school bombing, when Israeli reports showed international footage of \nwounded children and dead bodies described by foreign correspondents as \u201cCarnage in \nGaza\u201d (Sky News), \u201cGaza Offensive\u201d (CNN); \u201cPanic and chaos and many bodies\u201d (Sky \nNews); \u201cSchool Slaughter\u201d (Irish Independent), \u201cmurder\u2026genocide\u2026real massacre\u201d \n(Hugo Chavez on Venezuelan television). This contrasts with the Israeli media\u2019s \nembrace of the IDF narrative, which described the shelling as a response to Hamas \nlaunching attacks from the school compound (Keshev, 2009b), and used words such as \n\u201cbombing\u201d, \u201cattack\u201d, and \u201chit\u201d, to refer to Israel\u2019s actions. The dramatic terms used by \n 15 \nthe foreign media position the event in a fundamentally different realm of \nunderstanding to the one established by the Israeli media. The international media\u2019s \nterms introduce a rhetorical comparison that puts Israel\u2019s acts outside the framework of \n\u201cnormal\u201d war, placing them in the deviant category, that of crimes against humanity. \nForegoing conventional names and describing them as if seen for the first time, writes \nShklovsky (1990 [1925]: 6), calls attention to language thus making \u201cperception long \nand \u2018laborious\u2019 instead of automatic\u201d.       \n \nA second element in the reporting which engendered estrangement was reversal: the \noverturning of commonsensical roles and unquestioned categories of \u2018we\u2019 and \u2018them\u2019. \nReversal was created by showing highly graphic images of the suffering of Gazan \ncivilians, which contrasted with the imagery and narratives dominating the mainstream \nIsraeli media coverage of the war. The international news reports all showed distraught \nPalestinians amid scenes of devastation, weeping women, wounded adults and children, \nand dead bodies. These images disrupted the dominant Israeli media representations of \nthe war. Not only was the \u201cenemy\u2019s\u201d suffering, normally almost entirely absent from \nnational coverage, made visible, but commonsensical roles were reversed - the victims \nare \u2018them\u2019, and the aggressor is \u2018us\u2019.  \n \nThe third way that Israeli reporting of the war created estrangement with reference to \nthe international coverage, was through visualization and voicing criticism. Footage \nfrom international news shown in Israeli media included world leaders, e.g. \nVenezuela\u2019s President Hugo Chavez, condemning Israel\u2019s \u201cmassacre\u201d (Channel 10); \nwell known intellectuals, citizens and celebrities, e.g. the singer Annie Lenox \ndemonstrating against Israel in London (Channel 10); and angry and frustrated foreign \ncorrespondents expressing their strong criticism of Israel\u2019s media ban and military \noperation (Channel 2, Channel 10). These faces of strangers appeared on Israeli \nscreens, demanding viewers to face things as seen through the other\u2019s lenses. They call \nthe viewer to doubt themselves. At the same time, the international criticism voiced by \nworld politicians, intellectuals, artists and media, was commonly seen in the Israeli \npublic sphere as another version of Israel-hatred and anti-Semitism. Thus the potential \nself-distancing opened up by exposing criticisms of Israel from around the world, was \ncontained and suppressed by the interpretation of this international criticism within the \n 16 \nIsraeli society\u2019s siege mentality (Bar-Tal and Antebi, 1992) and the familiar \u201cthe world \nis against us\u201d narrative.      \n \nIn the international media coverage of the French riots and the Israeli media coverage \nof the Gaza war estrangement was achieved through fairly similar aesthetic and \ndiscursive techniques. However, as mentioned earlier, there is a fundamental difference \nbetween the two cases. In the French case the political system and the French culture \nallows relatively high degrees of self-distancing. Estrangement emerged through the \ncontinuous flow of images and stories that essentially disrupted the coherence and \nlegitimacy of the French media narratives. Conversely, the Israeli political system and \nculture do not allow meaningful expressions of self-distance. The common perception \namong Israelis of a state under siege (Bar-Tal and Antebi, 1992; Fisk, 2010) generates \nand promotes strong nationalist sentiments and discourages self-estrangement. Indeed, \nin the Israeli coverage of the Gaza war, estrangement was continuously in extreme \ntension with the elements that reinforced attachment (Orgad, 2009). This was \nmanifested in footage of international coverage which was often reappropriated to \nreassert rather than to challenge the dominant narrative of self-righteousness and to \nreaffirm the fathomless distance from the Palestinian people - \u201cthe enemy\u201d. Thus \nestrangement when it emerged was only glimpsed, it was momentary in the reporting. \nSuch moments of defamiliarization are often collapsed into a broader narrative of the \nfamiliar and the consensual, rendering their potential for creating distance from the \nfamiliar, destabilizing the commonsensical, and opening up critical discussion, largely \ndenied. I now give an example of how \u2018glimpses\u2019 of estrangement enabled by use of \ninternational coverage, are suppressed by reproduction and reassertion of the familiar, \ndominant, national narrative. It is followed by an example of a report that admits \nsimultaneously estrangement and attachment \u2013 a tension which I suggest, is productive.   \n \nEstrangement denied \nOn 1 January 2009, Channel 2 broadcast a piece about how the IDF military operation \nis perceived by foreign media. The reporter purports to present viewers with \u201ca range of \nreports from around the world\u201d, though the collection is highly selective, including \nedited footage from only two networks: CNN and Sky News. The edited excerpts tell \nsimilar stories: the destruction in Gaza on that day following Israel\u2019s killing of leading \nHamas commander, Niza Rayan. While both lots of footage include images of \n 17 \ndevastated civilians facing ruins, the emphasis is on Rayan\u2019s background as \u201cone of the \nmost\u2026 outspoken supporters of suicide bombings\u201d (Sky News) and on Israel\u2019s \nsatisfaction with the \u201cmajor success\u201d of its operation (Sky News). These accounts \nlargely mirror the official narrative that dominated the Israeli media, which emphasized \nthe military and strategic success of the operation (Keshev 2008; 2009a; 2009b) and \njustified the lives it claimed and the suffering and destruction it caused. Thus, the \nselection and presentation of foreign news reproduce a narrative based on \u201cimplicatory \ndenial\u201d (Cohen, 2001). There is no attempt to deny either the facts or their conventional \ninterpretation; rather, the moral implications are minimized by justifying the killing and \nwounding of civilians and the destruction caused by Israel as acts of necessity.  \n \nThis narrative is approved and legitimized by two authorities in the studio. First, anchor \nArad Nir praises the coverage as \u201cinformed and balanced reporting\u201d, while the Israeli \ngovernment spokesperson, Yosi Levi, commends the foreign media for demonstrating a \n\u201csober understanding of Israel\u2019s motive to defend itself\u201d. Thus, the international \ncoverage is used to underpin reiterations of familiar, commonplace justifications for \nIsrael\u2019s military action and denial of alternative explanations for this act and its \nconsequences.  \n  \nFollowing the images from the CNN and Sky broadcasts, in the second part of the piece \nYosi Levi is interviewed at length. Levi describes Israel\u2019s efforts to explain its story to \nthe world:  \n \nOur story is for the most part a very rational story. Unlike the Palestinian \npropaganda which gallops in the fields of emotion\u2026 we try to bring this \nemotional story to the realms of reason\u2026 \nOur story is of a democratic and liberal country which gave a chance to co-\nexistence with Gaza, despite Hamas\u2019 horror government, and in return got \nmissiles, terror, suicide bombings --- an impossible situation.    \n \nIf the CNN and Sky News pictures of devastated Palestinian civilians, shown in the first \npart of the report, evoked compassion towards Palestinian suffering \u2013if only \nmomentarily and to a limited degree - Levi\u2019s reframing of these images as the \nmanipulative acts of the irrational Orient erased this. It fervently espouses the deep-\n 18 \nseated binary opposition between \u2018them\u2019 - the irrational, depraved and violent Arabs - \nand \u2018us\u2019 - the rational, reasoned and \u2018normal\u2019 Israelis. Ultimately, then, while the \nprojection of a foreigner\u2019s view may encourage a degree of distance from Israelis\u2019 \nnarratives and perceptions of their nation, its appropriation by the national media may \nfurther extend the dehumanization of the other.            \n  \nThen there is a moment of estrangement when anchor Arad Nir comments on the \ninternational coverage shown to challenge the dominant IDF narrative. He asks Levi: \n\u201cBut how do you explain that we are a liberal and democratic country in view of these \nvery difficult pictures of children being evacuated from the rubbles of Niza Rayan\u2019s \nhouse?\u201d This question goes unanswered; the uncanny is again repressed. Nir\u2019s question \nis quickly \u2018buried\u2019 by Levi expounding on the familiar explanatory framework \nestablished earlier by him. \n \nEstrangement unlocked   \nOn 19 January 2009, Assaf Yehezkeli, one of Channel 2\u2019s leading journalists, broadcast \non the main evening news bulletin, a piece entitled \u201cThe foreign media stormed Gaza\u201d. \nIt opens with the reporter\u2019s voiceover: \u201cAnd now, the pictures we did not see, or did not \nwant to see, or could not see. Today, there is a foreign reporter standing by every house \nin Jabaliya, showing the world, without censorship, what they are seeing\u201d. This rather \ndramatic introduction speaks precisely to the ethical project, in which both national and \ninternational media are involved, of creating distance and its political force of battling \ndenial: acknowledging what we could not or did not want to know. It is followed by a \ncollection of footage from BBC, ABC, TVE, CNN and Al Jazeera in which foreign \nreporters are shown standing amongst the rubble of Gaza, describing the huge \ndestruction and utter helplessness of the survivors returning to what once were their \nhomes. The editing of these extracts is minimal; the reporting is subtitled in Hebrew. \nThe excerpts pose critical questions rarely voiced in the Israeli public sphere during the \nwar: the CNN piece suggests vandalism by Israeli soldiers; the ABC reporter discusses \naccusations that Israel deliberately tried to destroy mosques and gives voice to \nPalestinian victims who ask \u201cwhy they have been punished so hard\u201d; Al Jazeera quotes \na Palestinian returning to his home to find his money and jewellery have been \nplundered, who asks: \u201cWhat kind of human does this to someone\u2019s home?\u201d \n \n 19 \nThe piece decentres consciousness through seeing oneself as another; its use and \ndiscussion of international news reports invites defamiliarization from the \ncommonsensical narratives and imagery of the war. At the same time it maintains a \nclear sense of the reporter standing within the national community he is reporting on, \nprimarily through employment of the collective \u201cwe\u201d. The reporter, Yehezkeli, is the \nestranger, but fundamentally, is also estranged, as an Israeli, by the pictures from \ninternational networks. The international media, he tells his audience, might have a \npoint, which we cannot simply dismiss. Furthermore, the piece includes footage of \nPalestinian civilians criticizing Israel and Hamas \u2013 both sides are presented as \naccountable for the war; both sides are called on to take responsibility for helping the \nsurvivors. The familiar binary oppositions between us and them, right and wrong, are \nchallenged. So while use of footage from international network coverage provides \nviewers with the gaze of a stranger, it is the gaze of Simmel\u2019s stranger: near and remote \nat the same time. It allows a more ambivalent and complex narrative to emerge: the \ndistance invoked is neither too great nor too small; it is that \u201cmore or less precise \ndegree\u201d that Silverstone (2007: 47) describes as proper distance. Whether this proposal \nmade by the text for the viewer to establish a \u2018proper distance\u2019 is actually taken by \naudiences remains to be investigated.  \n \nEstrangement: Possibilities, dangers and incentives   \nPossibilities  \nEstrangement has become an inevitable, and arguably a more central feature in today\u2019s \nmediated environment. This capacity to impede the automatic perception of things and \nto see things anew can become meaningful, productive and transformative forces that \nenhance democratic public spheres. In France, the processes of doubting and the \nacknowledgment of issues and voices that for decades had been repressed, among other \nthings, gave a substantial push towards media diversity and representation of minorities \nin the French media (Malonga, cited in Harding, 2006). At the height of the riots, \nPresident Chirac acknowledged that \u201cthe [French] media must do more to reflect the \nreality of France today\u201d (Harding, 2006). Less than a year after the riots, Edouard \nPellet, France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions\u2019 adviser to the president on integration issues, presented a \nplan for \u201cpositive action for integration aimed at repairing inequalities and \n\u2018dewhitening\u2019 the screens, structures and mentalities\u201d (European Broadcasting Union, \n 20 \n2006). In 2009, President Nicolas Sarkozy announced new measures to bring diversity \nto elitist institutions, the civil service, politics and the media (Poggioli, 2009). Of \ncourse, multiple political, social, cultural and economic factors led to the positioning of \ndiversity, discrimination and racism at the top of France\u2019s political agenda; how or \nwhether they will be addressed remains to be seen. But the estrangement that emerged \nfrom the stark discrepancy between the international and French media coverage made \na significant contribution towards acknowledgement of these issues and their inclusion \nin the national public sphere.  \nDangers \nThat said, there are clearly significant challenges and dangers in realizing the ethical \nproject of estrangement. The freedom of the stranger, as Simmel (1971: 146) notes, \ncontains many dangerous possibilities: \u201cFrom earliest times, in uprising of all sorts the \nattacked part has claimed that there has been incitement from the outside, by foreign \nemissaries and agitators\u201d. The French media\u2019s reaction to international coverage of the \nunrest vividly exemplifies this: international media were accused of being \nsensationalist, their coverage was blamed for being excessive, exaggerated and fanning \nthe flames (Cozens, 2005; News Xchange 2005). Similarly, during the Gaza war, Yonit \nLevy, one of Israel\u2019s most popular news anchors, was accused of expressing what was \nperceived as excessive sympathy for the enemy in her coverage. Channel 2, which \nenjoys the highest number of viewers among Israel\u2019s television stations, was inundated \nwith complaints and demands that she be fired. An online petition entitled \u201cYonit \nLevy? Go Home!\u201d attracted more than 35,500 signatures. Unlike Assaf Yehezkeli \nwhose report was analyzed before, Yonit Levy was seen by Israeli viewers as an \nalienated estranger, standing too far from her national community, disengaged from her \nviewers. Rather than a productive force that invites viewers to consider a different \npoint of view and entertain the opportunity of expressing some distance from their own \nconvictions and truths, Levy\u2019s style of estrangement was perceived as alienation, her \ncriticism as illegitimate.    \nThus the split between self and other on which estrangement is based has negative \nimplications and even an explosive potential. It can engender substantial mistrust in the \nstorytellers on which we rely to make sense of our lives in this world. This mistrust can \nsurface in alienation and disorientation, and the discomfort and disturbance created can \n 21 \nbe transformed into denial rather than acknowledgement; the blocking of new visions in \nplace of opening up a reflexive space. This is what happened in the Israeli case: Levy \nwas seen as a traitor, an \u201cinner enemy\u201d; the disturbing pictures from international news \nchannels, for the most part, were framed as incitement by foreign agitators, to use \nSimmel\u2019s phrase: as anti-Semitic, faux, taking things out of context. Similarly, the \nFrench public sphere was replete with expressions of defensiveness, entrenchment in \n\u2018our\u2019 truth and \u2018our\u2019 moral superiority, denial, hostility and arrogance towards the \ninternational media and other countries (especially the US), accompanied sometimes by \nnationalist sentiments and xenophobic discourses. For example, writing on his blog \nFrench politician Alain Jupp\u00e9 accused the American press of \u2018unleashing itself against \nFrance\u2019 and \u2018taking revenge after Katrina and the ironic condescension demonstrated \nby us [the French] towards the American authorities\u2019 (P\u00e9gard, 2005). The ultimate \nconsequence of estrangement therefore might be the reinforcement of its conceptual \nopposite: attachment and entrenchment, encouraging the emergence of a France and an \nIsrael ever more confident, rather than doubtful, of their actions.  \n \nFurthermore, while the sensational pictures of the French riots shown on international \nnews may have played a positive role for French audiences, in offering them a different \nvision of themselves and French politics, for international audiences the coverage \narguably reinforced stereotypical ways of seeing France. Some even argue that \ninternational news reports misinformed their audiences: \u201ccontrary to the breathless \ndispatches from the American press, Paris was most certainly not burning\u2026To say that \nall of the French suburbs are hotbeds of radicalized passion (which TV images imply) is \nalso an overstatement. In fact, reaction from banlieue residents to the riots ranges from \nangry to cynical to oddly hopeful\u201d (Ng, 2005). Thus, while estrangement can become a \nproductive and progressive ethical project, it is crucial to recognize its ambivalence, \nthat is, to consider also it dangers and potential misuses.     \n \nIncentives \nSo why would and should news organizations \u2018do\u2019 estrangement? The international \nmedia are not bound as are national reporters, by established ties to the national \ncommunities to which and on which they report. They have ties to an international \naudience and to more universalist values. They can afford, therefore, to be the \nestranging horse.7 At the same time, international news channels might not accept that \n 22 \nestrangement is their role. In a private meeting held in June 20108 to discuss BBC \ncoverage of the Middle East, one of the participants commented (following Israel\u2019s raid \non the aid flotilla to Gaza in May 2010) that we are witnessing a growing gulf between \nhow the world perceives Israel and how Israel perceives itself. \u201cWhat does the BBC \nintend to do about that?\u201d he asked. A very senior BBC editor replied dismissively: \n\u201cwith due respect, this is not the BBC\u2019s responsibility to try to bridge this gulf\u201d. I agree \nwholeheartedly that bridging this gap is not the BBC\u2019s responsibility. However, I also \nwould claim that the BBC - and other international media - have a significant role to \nplay in the contemporary global age, in offering nations a foreign vision of themselves, \nto encourage them to gain a distance from their own cultures and narratives that \nnational media are often incapable of providing. I would argue that the moral task of \ninternational networks such as the BBC is to increase the gap, to offer nations different \nvisions of themselves from the ones that may dominate national screens. Italian cities \nused to recruit their judges from other cities to secure themselves against the influence \nof family interests and factionalism on the legal system (Simmel, 1964). We might \nthink of international news channels in terms of such external judges who could offer \nus, as national peoples, judgments that would be much more difficult, if not impossible, \nfor us to hand down about ourselves. Unlike the residents of those Italian cities, we do \nnot have to necessarily accept the stranger\u2019s judgments, but neither can we \u2013 as I hope \nmy analysis shows \u2013 pretend total ignorance of them.  \n \nNational media (anywhere) cannot afford to be, and nor perhaps should be, Tolstoy\u2019s \nhorse. There is a huge tension between the national media\u2019s \u201ccare structures\u201d (Scannell, \n1996), their work of symbolically \u2018gluing\u2019 together national communities and \nproviding them with a constant resource for community and a sense of belonging, and \nthe ethical project of symbolic distancing and decentring national consciousness. Yet \nthe national media have a pivotal responsibility to work towards the synthetic position \nof Simmel\u2019s stranger and Silverstone\u2019s proper distance \u2013 both close and far. It might be \nthat this can be only achieved, especially during times when the nation is perceived to \nbe under threat, in momentary \u201cglimpses\u201d. The moral and political force of these \nglimpses might be weak; they may fail to destabilize the far more forceful dominant \nnarrative that governs the screen. But it does not mean that the potential significance of \nsuch moments of estrangement should be dismissed. Rather, the focus should be on \n 23 \nhow their potential could be better realized. The value of detailed analyses of media \ntexts such as news reports is to locate such moments in order to consider ways in which \nthey can be mobilized for the creation of proper distance, or at least, a more appropriate \ndistance. \nThe moral argument aside, who would fund estrangement? What are the incentives for \nthe media to foster this ethical project and manage its potential explosiveness?9 After \nall, rather than disturbance, the increasingly commercially-driven, commodified and \nconsumerist orientation of the mediapolis promotes a \u201ccomfort culture\u201d (Sturken, in \nthis volume), which sells the idea of proximity, emotional connection, pacification and \nreassurance. I would like to propose four reasons why the media might be motivated to \n\u2018do\u2019 estrangement.  \nThe first derives from the simple fact that the media are competing businesses: each \nwants to be the first to show the images that will attract as wide an audience as possible. \n\u201cIf they do not show them, others will, and indeed are doing so, on the internet at least, \nand on global satellite channels\u201d (Silverstone, 2007: 26). Estrangement is often the \nproduct of those disturbing images that are uncomfortable to show and see, and yet this \nis precisely why everybody wants to see them. To be clear, I am not arguing for cynical \nand irresponsible use of estranging images, nor for a pornography of horror and pain. \nBut since \u201conce the media have opened the door to the visibility of the world, we \ncannot pretend that it is not there\u201d (Silverstone, 2007: 26), avoiding estrangement is no \nlonger an option. Instead, the task is to estrange with responsibility, to confront and \nengage rather than to disavow the uncanny.     \nThe second incentive, which is related to the former point, is explained succinctly by \nSimmel (1964: 218) (although of course the context is totally different): \u201cContrast \nexcites and simulates; similarity reassures\u201d. The media\u2019s enterprise is to excite and \nstimulate us, and audiences derive pleasures from the strange, which contrasts and \ndisrupts their sense of self (see, e.g. the fascinating discussion in Griffin (1994), of the \npleasures of satire, especially self-satirizing, i.e. that is directed against ourselves). \nThus while there is a fundamental tension between the news and estrangement, they \ncan be mutually reinforcing. Estrangement might go hand in hand with exciting, \nstimulating and perhaps even pleasing audiences (though this should not be the \nmotivation for estrangement).  \n 24 \nThe third reason why the media should invest in the project of estrangement is that it \nconstitutes a significant basis for public trust. This might seem a contradiction in terms: \nwhy would the public trust media that estrange them? They surely prefer media that \nreassure, that give them the feeling that their particular existence is legitimate. \nHowever, media that only or mainly reassure and comfort, media that are \u201ctoo close\u201d in \nSilverstone\u2019s terms, not only betray their moral responsibility, they ultimately fail to \nconstitute a meaningful (and thus in the long-term trustable) resource for the conduct of \nour lives, as individuals and as a community. As Simmel (1964) argues, it is both the \nsimilar and the contrasting, the near and the far, though by very different means, that \ngive us the feeling that our existence is legitimate. We need continuously to maintain \nthe reality that we have produced and to repair it \u201cfor it consistently breaks down\u201d; and \nwe must also, often, \u201cwith fear and regret, toss away our authoritative representations \nof reality and begin to build the world anew\u201d (Carey, 1992: 30). Estrangement is thus a \nvital resource that the media have to offer us, if they are to sustain their relevance to \nour lives and to ensure our trust in them in the long run.    \nThe fourth reason refers specifically to why the global media might have an interest in \n\u201cdoing\u201d estrangement. The global media depend on communicative ethos and practice \nthat promote openness, freedom of expression, information flow, tolerance and cultural \npluralism. However \u201ccapitalist\u201d they are, and notwithstanding the implications of their \ncommercial interests, global media prosper if their work furthers an open, democratic \ncommunication. Estrangement precisely fits with these values and practice \u2013 it presents \nopportunities to express different views and thus different degrees of distance, \nspecifically from nationalist narratives. It is therefore in the global media\u2019s self-interest \nto encourage estrangement, as it ultimately strengthens their democratic character, \nwhich makes them more sustainable.   \nConclusion  \nA degree of estrangement from one\u2019s own culture and history is essential if one is to \nconsider seriously how to cultivate the capacity to act morally and justly in the world \n(Gilroy, 2004). For Sennett (1994) and Gilroy (2004), like Montesquieu writing more \nthan two centuries earlier, the prime location for the cultivation of estrangement is the \nmetropolis. Today, another location, if not the prime location for this moral project is \n 25 \nthe mediapolis. Silverstone (2007) suggests that the mediapolis is the mediated public \nspace of appearance where the materiality of the world is constructed through \nelectronically communicated public speech and action. It is where judgements and \ndecisions are presented and represented, debated, and sometimes made. It is where \npublic life happens in contemporary societies.    \nThe mediapolis should therefore be a primary location where we can learn to practise \nforms of disloyalty to our own cultures, histories and narratives, if we seek to \nunderstand them, or to interact equitably with cultures, narratives and histories \nestablished elsewhere. The news offers a particularly productive site for estrangement: \nthe strange and the unfamiliar are interwoven with the ordinary, the familiar, and the \nroutine; distance is evoked within a space that embodies the habitual, the normality of \nour everyday life, the proximate. At the same time, the news cannot engage in \nsystematic estrangement - this remains the privilege of art, literature and estranging \ngenres such as satire. The very essence of estrangement, after all, is that it is not \nsystematic: it removes us from the ordinary taken-for-granted perceptions. The media \ncan and should strive to lift the most meaningful, yet often taken-for-granted elements \nof our culture and social order for contemplation and reflection, to allow us significant \nexperiences of self-displacement, in order to helps us know the world and its others \nbetter and to experience them in more complex, inclusive, moral and satisfying forms.    \n 26 \nReferences   \n \nBar-Tal, D. and Antebi, D.

Laing (1990 [1967]), in relation \nto psychosis and mental illness, wrote influentially about the experience of the split between self and the \nother, in which the self reverses its role as the observer of others, to being looked upon by itself.  \n2 Research consistently shows how journalism during crisis is characterized by the assumption of shared \nvalues, with journalists reporting events as members of the national community and invoking patriotism \nand a generalized consensual \u201cwe\u201d, the adoption of unquestioned binary categories of \u2018us\u2019 and \u2018them\u2019 \nand a reassertion of the dominant national narratives (Peri, 1999; Schudson, 2002; Waisbord, 2002; \nZandberg and Neiger, 2005). Hallin (1986, cited in Schudson, 2002, p. 40) describes this as the \njournalist\u2019s tendency during war and crisis to move towards a \u201csphere of consensus\u201d. \n3 The scope of this paper and the space available makes it impossible to provide an elaborated analysis of \nthe coverage of each of these cases (see Orgad 2008, 2009). I use examples only in order to support the \nbroader argument about the potential role of the media in cultivating estrangement.  \n4 The blogsphere also played a role, with bloggers reporting from the scene of the uprisings, but this \naspect is beyond the scope of this paper.   \n5 See, e.g., Blog TV, 6 November; Un Blog de bretagne, 6 November 2005.  \n6 Twelve news items were analysed. All citations from the reports are my translation.  \n7 Al Jazeera is often seen as occupying this role by bringing audiences content and style of reporting that \ndivorce things from the meanings usually ascribed to them by western viewers, and presenting \nfundamentally different understandings (although more research on Al Jazeera is needed to evaluate and \nsubstantiate this claim). \n8 The meeting was held under Chatham House Rules, i.e. neither the identities nor affiliations of the \nspeakers or any other participants can be revealed \n9 I thank John Peters for raising this question and encouraging me to address it.  \n"}
