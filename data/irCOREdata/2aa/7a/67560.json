Cost-effective approaches to prevent progression of the disease in primary care are needed. \nEvidence suggests that intensive multifactorial interventions including medication and behaviour \nchange can significantly reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among patients with \nestablished type 2 diabetes, and that patient education in self-management can improve short-term \noutcomes. However, existing studies cannot isolate the effects of behavioural interventions promoting \nself-care from other aspects of intensive primary care management. The ADDITION-Plus trial was \ndesigned to address these issues among recently diagnosed patients in primary care over one year. \n \nMethods\/Design: ADDITION-Plus is an explanatory randomised controlled trial of a facilitator-led, \ntheory-based behaviour change intervention tailored to individuals with recently diagnosed type 2 \ndiabetes. 34 practices in the East Anglia region participated. 478 patients with diabetes were \nindividually randomised to receive (i) intensive treatment alone (n=239), or (ii) intensive treatment \nplus the facilitator-led individual behaviour change intervention (n=239). Facilitators taught patients \nkey skills to facilitate change and maintenance of key behaviours (physical activity, dietary change, \nmedication adherence and smoking), including goal setting, action planning, self-monitoring and \nbuilding habits. The intervention was delivered over one year at the participant\u2019s surgery and included \na one-hour introductory meeting followed by six 30-minute meetings and four brief telephone calls. \nPrimary endpoints are physical activity energy expenditure (assessed by individually calibrated heart \nrate monitoring and movement sensing), change in objectively measured dietary intake (plasma \nvitamin C), medication adherence (plasma drug levels), and smoking status (plasma cotinine levels) at \none year. We will undertake an intention-to-treat analysis of the effect of the intervention on these \nmeasures, an assessment of cost-effectiveness, and analyse predictors of behaviour change in the \ncohort.  \n \nDiscussion: The ADDITION-Plus trial will establish the medium-term effectiveness and cost-\neffectiveness of adding an externally facilitated intervention tailored to support change in multiple \nbehaviours among intensively-treated individuals with recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes in primary \ncare. Results will inform policy recommendations concerning the management of patients early in the \ncourse of diabetes. Findings will also improve understanding of the factors influencing change in \nmultiple behaviours, and their association with health outcomes. \n \nTrial registration: ISRCTN99175498 \n \n \n  Page 3 of 23 \nBackground \nDiabetes presents a global challenge to health and well being. The total number of people with the \ncondition is projected to rise from 285 million in 2010 to 438 million in 2030 [1]. More than 2.5 \nmillion people in the UK are estimated to have diabetes, and the condition is the leading cause of \nkidney failure, blindness in adults, and amputations in the UK [2]. The condition can affect mental \nhealth and well-being, and is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke, reducing life expectancy \non average by 10 years [3]. \n \nThe clinical care of people with diabetes currently consumes around 10% of the NHS budget, a total \nexceeding \u00a39 billion [2]. People with diabetes (or their carers) are responsible for the day-to-day \nmanagement of their condition, which includes eating a healthy diet, being physically active, taking \nmedication as prescribed and not smoking. There is scope for improvement in the prevalence of \nhealth-promoting behaviours among people at risk of and with diabetes [4-6]. Developing effective \napproaches to prevent progression of the disease by intensification of primary care management, \nincluding prescribing and organisation of services, and by directly supporting individual patients in \nself care, is important in tackling the growing public health burden of type 2 diabetes [7, 8].  \n \nEvidence to support behavioural interventions to reduce cardiovascular risk \nThere is good evidence that the onset of diabetes can be delayed, and cardiovascular risk factors \nreduced, by intensive interventions targeting multiple behaviours among large groups of individuals \nwith impaired glucose tolerance followed up over several years [9]. The lifestyle interventions in these \nprogrammes were individually tailored and delivered by case managers or nutritionists with extended \ntraining. They drew on a range of theoretical perspectives and used techniques such as goal setting and \nself monitoring. In these studies the risk of diabetes was directly associated with change in lifestyle: \nthe more behavioural targets that the participants achieved at follow-up, the lower their incidence of \ndiabetes [10, 11]. \n \nIt has been recognised for some time that well organised care, including regular recall and review of \npatients, is associated with better outcomes [12]. More recently, there is also evidence from primary \ncare that regular patient follow-up supported by prompting of doctors, feedback on goal attainment, \nand continuing medical education and guidelines can improve cardiovascular risk factors in patients \nfollowed 8 years from diagnosis compared with routine care [13]. Later in the disease trajectory there \nis evidence from secondary care that intensive multifactorial intervention including prescription of \nmedication and behavioural advice compared with routine care, can significantly reduce \ncardiovascular mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria after 8 years. The \nresults showed a 50% reduction in cardiovascular and microvascular events in the intervention group \ncompared with routine care. However, the intervention had only minor effects on carbohydrate and fat \n  Page 4 of 23 \nintake, and no significant differences were observed for self-reported smoking and exercise habits \nbetween groups [14]. The Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) trial is a multi-centre, clinic-\nbased randomised trial comparing the effects of an intensive lifestyle intervention with diabetes \nsupport and education (control group) on cardiovascular risk factors and major cardiovascular disease \namong 5,145 overweight or obese individuals with clinically-detected type 2 diabetes [15]. Four-year \nresults from the trial are encouraging, with participants in the intensive lifestyle arm achieving greater \nweight loss and greater improvements in fitness, glycated haemoglobin, systolic blood pressure, and \nHDL-cholesterol than those in the control group. The intervention was very intensive and participants \nwere followed up annually. Overall, the evidence to date suggests that the greatest impact on \ncardiovascular risk is from intensified prescribing rather than patient education or behavioural \ninterventions [7, 8]. Despite this there is widespread introduction of healthy lifestyle facilitators, or \nhealth trainers, throughout England [16]. \n \nLimitations to the evidence to support diabetes management in primary care. \nWhile evidence from earlier studies is encouraging, it is not clear which approaches or combinations \ncan cost-effectively support behavioural change in people with newly or recently diagnosed type 2 \ndiabetes in primary care. Most of the studies that demonstrate benefits from interventions targeting \nmultiple behavioural risk factors have been conducted in research clinics or specialist settings. In \nparticular it is unclear whether direct intervention by specialist lifestyle trainers to facilitate behaviour \nchange can add significantly to intensive management by core multidisciplinary primary care teams. In \nthe primary care of type 2 diabetes there are now an increasing number of trials of case management, \nand self-management of diabetes that include a focus on key risk behaviours; lack of regular physical \nactivity, unhealthy dietary intake and smoking. Reviews of randomised studies [17, 18] support the \neffectiveness of patient self-management training in improving the management of type 2 diabetes in \nthe short term. However, the contents of many interventions have not been clearly specified and \nmeasurement of quality of delivery or receipt is largely lacking. It is thus difficult to unravel why the \neffectiveness of behavioural interventions is so variable. With longer follow-up (>6 months), some of \nthe behavioural interventions that used regular contact with patients for reinforcement were effective \nin improving glycaemic control. Educational interventions using a patient-centred approach to goal \nsetting and problem-solving were more promising than didactic interventions in improving glycaemic \ncontrol, weight, and lipid profiles [17-20]. Interventions based primarily on providing information \nabout how to behave to avoid negative health outcomes are less effective than those using well-\nspecified behaviour change techniques, building on participants' own motivations within a \npsychological framework [21, 22].  \n \nMost of these studies omit the behaviour of medication taking. Yet intensive use of multiple \nmedications to control cardiovascular risk factors has been a central tenet of effective interventions to \n  Page 5 of 23 \nimprove cardiovascular outcomes in type 2 diabetes over the last ten years [23, 24]. Patients can find \ntaking medication regularly difficult, particularly for multiple drugs in asymptomatic conditions [25, \n26], emphasising the need for interventions to support medication taking as prescribed alongside other \nhealth-related behaviours.  \n \nA major limitation of studies to date is the inability to isolate the effects of behavioural interventions \nfrom other aspects of intensified management including prescribing and organisation of services. This \napplies to both the effect of the intervention on behaviour, and the subsequent effect of behaviour \nchange on clinical outcomes such as cardiovascular risk. The measurement of the behaviours \nthemselves is a challenge, with the majority of trials relying on self-report, which is imprecise and \nsusceptible to recall bias. Few behavioural interventions specify a hypothesised mechanism of action \nof behaviour change techniques, and only a minority measure behaviour and its hypothesised \ndeterminants along a specified causal pathway. This has limited the ability to identify active \ningredients of interventions aimed at facilitating behaviour change and maintenance [27] and to \nreplicate effective interventions in specific clinical settings.  \n \nNo studies of behavioural management of type-2 diabetes in primary care early in the trajectory of the \ndisease have demonstrated effects on cardiovascular disease-related events or mortality; economic \nanalyses are absent or limited; and few studies examine health-care utilization or patient-centred \noutcomes such as quality of life or functional status. Performance, selection, attrition, and detection \nbiases are common in the studies reviewed, and external generalisability is often limited. \n \nLarge gaps thus remain in the evidence concerning effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of \ninterventions to improve multiple cardiovascular risk factors among patients with type 2 diabetes in \nprimary care by behavioural means [20, 28]. It is unclear whether interventions, based on theory and \nevidence from psychology [29, 30] and designed to facilitate and maintain changes in behaviour \n(physical activity, diet, medication adherence and smoking), could be cost-effective among people \ndetected early in the trajectory of the disease. It is also unclear how such interventions are best \ndelivered within a health service. The existing evidence points to the importance of clinical and social \ncontext of both the patient and practitioner in enabling or obstructing health-related behaviour \nchanges, and of a coherent approach by primary and secondary care [20]. The ADDITION-Plus trial \nwas established to address these gaps.  \n \nThe ADDITION-Plus trial was originally established within the intensive treatment group in the \nCambridge centre of the ADDITION study (Figure 1). In brief, the Anglo-Danish-Dutch Study of \nIntensive Treatment of people with newly diagnosed diabetes in primary care (ADDITION) study was set-\nup in 2001 [31]. It is a primary care-based study consisting of a screening phase followed by a pragmatic \n  Page 6 of 23 \nopen-label cluster randomised controlled trial comparing the effect on cardiovascular risk of intensive \nmulti-factorial therapy and theory-based diabetes education delivered by practice nurses (intensive \ntreatment) with routine care in patients with screen-detected diabetes.  \n \nThe aim of ADDITION-Plus was to assess whether a behaviour change intervention delivered by trained \nand quality-assured lifestyle facilitators, external to the primary care team, was a cost-effective addition to \nintensive treatment and could achieve and maintain changes in important health related behaviours \n(physical activity, dietary change, medication adherence and smoking cessation) when offered to people \nwith recently diagnosed diabetes already receiving intensive general practice based care. Follow-up was at \none year post-randomisation. The trial recruited screen-detected type 2 diabetes patients from within the \nADDITION-Cambridge trial [32], and included patients with type 2 diabetes clinically diagnosed within \nthe previous three years. As such, the ADDITION-Plus trial allows estimation of the additional \ncontribution of a facilitator-led intervention to good practice care in the optimisation of healthy behaviours \nand well-being, and to the reduction in cardiovascular risk factors in individuals with recently diagnosed \ndiabetes. \n \n \nADDITION-Plus objectives \nTo quantify the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of adding a facilitator-led theory-based behaviour \nchange intervention to intensive treatment of screen- and clinically- detected type 2 diabetes patients, and \nto analyse the psychological, socio-demographic and clinical predictors of behaviour change in the cohort. \nThe following research questions are posed:  \n \nTrial analysis \n1. Can a facilitator-led intervention, based on theory and evidence from psychology, to increase and \nmaintain health-promoting behaviours (physical activity, dietary change, taking medication and \nsmoking cessation) achieve clinically important and measurable change in these behaviours when \noffered to people with screen-detected diabetes and to those recently diagnosed with diabetes?  \n \nPrimary outcomes include objectively measured physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake, \nmedication adherence, and smoking status.  \n \nSecondary outcomes include (i) a composite measure of behaviour derived from the four primary \noutcomes; (ii) self-reported behaviours; (iii) modelled cardiovascular risk (UKPDS risk engine, \nv3[33]); (iv) levels of individual clinical risk factors; (v) functional status, health utility and quality of \nlife; and (vi) costs and cost-effectiveness. \n \nCohort analysis \n  Page 7 of 23 \n2. What and how changes were achieved in objectively measured health behaviours and health \noutcomes across the trial cohort? \n 2.1 What are the psychological, socio-demographic and clinical predictors of self-reported and \nobjectively measured behaviour change? \n 2.2 What are the clinical consequences of behaviour change? \n \nMethods and Design \nDesign and setting \nThe ADDITION-Plus study is nested within the intensive treatment arm of the ADDITION-Cambridge \ntrial with additional practices (n=8) added to increase the recruitment of recently diagnosed patients; \nsee Figure 1 for details of study design and patient flows. Participants were recruited from 34 general \npractices in urban, suburban and rural Cambridgeshire, East Hertfordshire, West Suffolk and North \nEssex areas of England. 239\/425 eligible screen-detected patients from ADDITION-Cambridge study, \nand 239\/684 patients clinically diagnosed within the previous 3 years were individually randomised to \nreceive intensive treatment alone or in conjunction with a facilitator-led behaviour change \nintervention. \n \nEthical approval was obtained from the Eastern Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committee (reference \nnumber: 02\/5\/54). Participants gave written informed consent to take part in the study. ISRCTN \n99175498. \n \nParticipants \nEligibility criteria (initially assessed by general practice staff) included: age (40-69yrs) with type 2 \ndiabetes following (i) screening in the ADDITION programme or (ii) clinical diagnosis during the \nthree previous years in participating GP surgeries. Exclusion criteria included women who were \npregnant or lactating or anybody who had a psychotic illness or an illness with a likely prognosis of \nless than one year. \n \nIndividual randomisation of participants to one of two carefully characterised interventions was \nindependent of intervention facilitators, study coordination and measurement teams, and central using a \npartial minimisation procedure that dynamically adjusted the randomisation probabilities to balance \nstratifiers (age, sex and general practice, and within screen-detected and clinically-diagnosed subgroups: \nsmoking, self-reported medication adherence [34] and BMI). The stratifiers were individually weighted in \norder that those with more categories (such as general practice) could achieve an even distribution \nbetween the two arms. A random element was included in the minimisation to allow a sound basis for \ninference.  \n \n  Page 8 of 23 \nIntensive treatment (comparison arm) \nThe following features were added to routine multi-disciplinary primary care of diabetes to achieve \nintensive treatment in both trial groups: \n \n1. Academic detailing for general practitioners and practice nurses: A practice-based academic \ndetailing session for primary care teams was conducted by a local diabetologist or GP opinion leader \nto describe the treatment algorithms and targets, patient materials, and to present the evidence \nunderpinning intensive treatment. \n \n2. Treatment algorithms: These were based on trial data demonstrating the benefits of intensive \ntreatment of several cardiovascular risk factors in people with diabetes [35-38], and recommended \nmedication within licensed indications (Table 1). GPs were advised to consider prescribing an \nangiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor to patients with a blood pressure \u2265120\/80 and either a \nprevious cardiovascular event or at least one other cardiovascular risk factor [39]. The remainder of \nthe intervention was based on the stepwise target-led regimen from the Steno-2 study [23] aimed at \noptimising hyperglycaemia, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and microalbuminuria. GPs were advised to \nconsider prescribing 75mg of aspirin daily to patients without specific contraindications. Although \ntargets for treatment were specified and classes of drugs recommended, where there was a choice \nbetween individual drugs the decision was made by the GPs and patients. The intensive treatment \nprotocol was revised after publication of the Heart Protection Study [40] to include a recommendation \nto prescribe a statin to all patients with a cholesterol level of \u22653.5 mmol\/l.  \n \n3. Treatment targets:  HbA1c <7% (with a recommendation to initiate treatment at a threshold of 6.5%), \nblood pressure \u2264135\/85mmHg, total cholesterol <5mmol\/l or < 4.5mmol\/l for people with a history of \nischaemic heart disease. \n \n4. Audit and feedback: Interactive practice-based audit and feedback sessions were organised around 6 \nand 14 months after the academic detailing session and annually thereafter. They consisted of \ndiscussion of overall achievement of treatment targets and optimisation of the management of \nindividual patients.  \n \n5. Provision of glucometers for patients: Blood glucometers and training in their use were provided to \nthe primary care team. However, the decision to offer a glucometer to a patient was left to \npractitioners. \n   \n6. Theory-based diabetes education: Practice nurses were provided with theory-based education \nmaterials to discuss with, and give to patients in order to provide a shared framework for the causes, \n  Page 9 of 23 \nconsequences and treatment of diabetes (\u2018Getting Started with Diabetes\u2019). The materials were \ndeveloped by a multidisciplinary team and drew on Leventhal\u2019s Common-Sense Model [41].  They \ncross-referred to \u2018Diabetes for Beginners-Type 2\u2019 a Diabetes UK publication [42] that was included in \nthe patient information pack. The materials stressed the importance of a healthy lifestyle for the \ncontrol of diabetes and associated health problems and provided targets for behaviour change. \nSpecifically, participants with a BMI>28kg\/m\u00b2 were encouraged to lose 5-10% of their body weight, \nand all participants to increase physical activity gradually (recommendations to reach the equivalent of \n35 minutes of brisk walking per day for 7 days per week), decrease the consumption of fatty foods and \nsugar, increase the consumption of fruit, vegetables, and whole grains, avoid excessive alcohol intake, \ntake their medication regularly, self-monitor their blood glucose level (if applicable) and attend annual \nhealth checks. Participants who smoked were encouraged to stop.  \n \n7. Funding to support more frequent contact between patients and practitioners: Practices received \nfunding equivalent to three 10-minute consultations with a GP and three 15-minute nurse \nappointments per patient per year. \n \n8. Dietary counselling: GPs were recommended to refer all newly diagnosed patients to a dietician. \n \nIntervention group: Intensive treatment plus facilitator led behaviour change intervention \nParticipants in this group received intensive treatment (described above) plus a facilitator-led, \nindividually tailored behaviour change intervention, based on psychological theory and evidence. The \nintervention was delivered by trained lifestyle facilitators, who were not part of the practice team. The \nfacilitators used detailed protocols for each contact with the participant and received on-going \nsupervision and feedback from a Clinical Psychologist, informed by assessment of tape-recorded \nconsultations, enabling tight quality assurance of intervention delivery. The intervention was designed \nto build on the diabetes education delivered by practice nurses and intensive treatment by the practice \nteam. The behaviours targeted in the intervention were physical activity, dietary intake, medication \nadherence, and smoking cessation. Hypothesised mediators of behaviour change targeted in the \nintervention included illness perceptions based on Leventhal\u2019s Common-Sense Model [41] and beliefs \nabout behaviour change based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) [29].  The intervention \ntargeted instrumental (e.g. health) and affective beliefs about changing specific behaviours, (lack of) \nencouragement by important others (subjective norm), and perceived barriers and facilitators of \nbehaviour change (perceived behavioural control). The behaviour change techniques used by the \nfacilitators could be mapped onto the TPB (e.g., giving information, strengthening motivation), \nOperant Theory (identifying cues for action and reinforcement of behaviour change or effort), Carver \nand Scheier\u2019s Control Theory (e.g., goal setting, action planning, self-monitoring) and Relapse \nPrevention Theory (e.g., preparing for and dealing with setbacks) [29, 43-45]. Facilitators taught \n  Page 10 of 23 \npatients this range of self-regulatory skills to achieve behaviour change and maintenance over time, \nwhich was supported by a manual describing the skills. Each patient initially selected to work on the \nbehaviour(s) they most wanted to change and felt most confident about changing. The facilitator later \ndiscussed with them other domains in which change was possible and encouraged patients to consider \nsetting additional goals. Interested patients were offered pedometers and\/or glucometers. The \nintervention was delivered over one year at the participants\u2019 surgeries. It included a one-hour \nintroductory meeting followed by six 30-minute meetings and four brief phone calls. Facilitators \nvisited participant\u2019s homes or workplaces if it was not possible to meet in the surgery. \n \nMeasurement \nTable 1 shows the measures taken at each stage in the ADDITION-Plus study. Baseline measurements \nwere carried out on all eligible patients including the completion of questionnaires, physiological and \nanthropometric measures, and venesection. Similar measurements were conducted one year after \nrecruitment. Measurements were undertaken at outpatient clinical research facilities by trained staff \nfollowing standard operational procedures and unaware of participants\u2019 study group allocation. Double \ndata entry of all anthropometric and questionnaire measures was undertaken by experienced, \nindependent agencies, blind to study group (Wyman Dillon Research and Data Management, Bristol, \nUK and Document Technologies and Imaging Solutions Ltd, Chalgrove, Oxford, UK). \n \nObjectively measured health behaviours: Physical activity was assessed at one-year using a combined \nheart rate and movement sensor (Actiheart, CamNtech, Cambridge, UK), which was worn \ncontinuously for at least 4 days [46]. A graded treadmill walk test was used for individual calibration \nof heart rate [47], a procedure which also provides an estimate of cardio-respiratory fitness by \nextrapolation of the HR-VO2 relationship to age-predicted maximal heart rate [48]. Heart rate data \ncollected during the free-living period were pre-processed [49] and activity intensity (J\/min\/kg) was \nestimated using a branched equation framework [47, 50]. Resulting time-series data were summarised \ninto physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE, in kJ\/kg\/day) and time spent in sedentary and \nmoderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (SPA and MVPA, min\/day), whilst minimising \ndiurnal information bias caused by non-wear periods (segments of non-physiological data). \nParticipants without individual calibration data but who provided data during free-living were \nprocessed using an age, sex, beta blocker, and sleeping heart rate adjusted group calibration equation \nfor the translation of heart rate into activity intensity. \n \nDietary intake was assessed at baseline and one-year by plasma vitamin C levels. Vitamin C is not \nendogenously produced and therefore provides a robust measurement of consumption. Medication \nadherence was assessed at one-year by plasma drug levels. Concentrations of metformin, simvastatin \nand atorvastatin in plasma samples were measured by liquid-chromatography mass-spectrometry (LC-\n  Page 11 of 23 \nMS\/MS) after protein precipitation extraction. The LC-MS\/MS methods for simvastatin and \natorvastatin were established at Quotient Bioresearch Ltd. (Fordham) for the ADDITION-Plus study. \nThe metformin method was validated at Quotient Bioresearch Ltd. (Fordham) for a previous study \n[51]. The calibration ranges for each of the analytes were as follows: metformin 5.00-5000 ng\/mL, \nsimvastatin 0.100-50.0 ng\/mL and atorvastatin 0.0600 to 30.0 ng\/mL. Objective measurement of \nsmoking was assessed by analysis of cotinine levels in plasma samples using an Immulite\u00ae Nicotine \nmetabolite solid phase competitive chemiluminescent immunoassay (Siemens). \n \nSelf-reported health behaviours: Physical activity was assessed using the validated EPAQ2 [52] and \nIPAQ [53] questionnaires. Dietary intake was evaluated using a validated food frequency \nquestionnaire [54]. Medication adherence was assessed by the Medication Adherence Report Schedule \n(MARS) questionnaire [34]. Smoking status and alcohol consumption were assessed by questionnaire. \n \nModelled CVD risk: The UKPDS model [33] uses information on sex, ethnicity, smoking status, \npresence or absence of atrial fibrillation, systolic blood pressure, HbA1c, total cholesterol, and HDL-\ncholesterol to predict the 10-year risk of primary CVD. Predicted events include myocardial \ninfarction, sudden cardiac death, other incident ischaemic heart disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular \ndisease death. \n \nBiochemical measures: HbA1c was analysed in venous samples at the time of diagnostic testing by ion-\nexchange high-performance liquid chromatography on a Tosoh machines (Tosoh Bioscience, \nRedditch, UK). Serum total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides was measured by means of \nenzymatic techniques (Dade Behring Dimension analyser, Newark, USA). Plasma creatinine was \nanalysed with kinetic colorimetric methods, and urine albumin by rate nephelemetry (Dade Behring \nNephelometer II, Newark, USA). Plasma levels of urea and electrolytes, bilirubin, alanine \naminotansferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, and thyroid \nstimulating hormone (TSH) and urine levels of creatinine were assayed by means of the Dade Behring \nDimension analyser. Metaphosphoric acid was added to plasma samples for vitamin C analysis before \nbeing stored at -80C\u00b0. Plasma vitamin C level was measured with a Fluoroskan Ascent FL \nfluorometer. The albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) was measured on a random spot urine specimen.  \n \nClinical measures: Blood pressure was calculated as the mean of three measurements performed after at \nleast 10 minutes rest, while participants were seated with the cuff on the predominant arm at the level of \nthe heart, using an automatic sphygmomanometer (Omron M4, UK). ECG was recorded by a 12 lead \nmachine. Body height and weight were measured in light indoor clothing and without shoes using a \nfixed rigid stadiometer and a scale (SECA, UK) respectively. Waist circumference was estimated as \nthe average of two measurements taken with a tape measure halfway between the lowest point of the rib \n  Page 12 of 23 \ncage and the anterior superior iliac crests when standing. Body fat percentage was measured by bio-\nelectrical impedance (TANITA, Tokyo, Japan). Angina was assessed using the Rose angina \nquestionnaire [55]. Neuropathy was evaluated using an adapted version of the Michigan Neuropathy \nScreening Instrument [56].   \n \nHealth utility, functional status, quality of life, well-being, treatment satisfaction and anxiety: The \ngeneric and disease-specific instruments used were diabetes well-being questionnaire (W-BQ12) [57], \nSF-36 [58], Audit of Diabetes-Dependent Quality of Life (ADDQoL) [57], diabetes treatment \nsatisfaction (DTS) [57], and EuroQol (EQ-5D) [59], and the short form of the state scale of the \nSpiegelberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [60]. All patients completed the consultation and \nrelational empathy (CARE) measure in relation to the GP and practice nurse; participants in the \nintervention group also completed this measure in relation to the lifestyle facilitator [61]. Participants \nwere also asked to complete six items at one year asking about their views on the diabetes service they \nhad received in the last 12 months, including frequency of contact, information and advice received, \nand satisfaction with the service. Participants were also asked about the frequency of and views about \nself-monitoring of blood glucose using the Diabetes Glycaemic Education and Monitoring (DiGem) \nstudy questionnaire [62]. \n \nBeliefs about behaviour change, illness perceptions, and habit: A questionnaire, developed according \nto TPB guidelines [29, 63], assessed selected cognitions about becoming more physically active, \neating a lower fat diet, taking medication and smoking: intention, perceived behavioural control, and \nbehavioural beliefs. Each construct was assessed with two items, measured on a 5-point Likert-type \nscale ranging from \u2018strongly disagree\u2019 to \u2018strongly agree\u2019. Examples of perceived control items are: \u2018I \nam confident that I could be more physically active\/eat a lower fat diet in the next 12 months, if I \nwanted to\u2019; for intention: \u2018I intend to be more physically active\/eat a lower fat diet in the next 12 \nmonths\u2019; and for behavioural beliefs: \u2018If I was more physically active\/did eat a lower fat diet in the \nnext 12 months, it is likely that I would lose weight\u2019. We used the consequences and treatment control \nsubscales (11 items) of the Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised (IPQ-R) [64, 65]. The \nconsequences scale assessed seriousness of diabetes and the impact of diabetes on various aspects of \nlife. An example is: \u2018My diabetes is a serious condition\u2019. The treatment control scale assessed beliefs \nand feelings associated with the management of diabetes. An example is: \u2018My treatment can control \nmy diabetes\u2019. Both scales were measured on 5-point Likert-type scales ranging from \u2018strongly \ndisagree\u2019 to \u2018strongly agree\u2019. Participants were also asked to complete a nine-item closed-response \nquestionnaire covering basic knowledge of diabetes and its\u2019 management [66]. At one year, \nparticipants were asked to write down the most important change that they had made in their physical \nactivity and dietary intake, and 12 items were used to assess to what extent these changes had become \na habit [67]. \n  Page 13 of 23 \n \nIntervention evaluation. Participants in the intervention group completed 10 items at one year about \ntheir views on the frequency of contacts with the lifestyle facilitators, clarity of advice given, \neducational materials, and overall intervention. They also completed a skills questionnaire assessing \ntheir confidence in relation to using nine skills (e.g., goal setting, action planning, self-monitoring) on \na 10-point scale ranging from \u2018not at all confident\u2019 to \u2018very confident\u2019, and use of these skills in the \npast 11 months in order to increase physical activity, eat a lower-fat diet, try to stop smoking (if \napplicable) and try to take medicines regularly as prescribed (if applicable) on a binary scale (yes\/no).  \n \nCosts: Health service use in the three months prior to follow-up was quantified using an adapted \nversion of the Health Services Research Unit Aberdeen questionnaire that enquires about the use of  \nservices (consultations with healthcare professionals and hospitalisations) and medications [68].  \n \nParticipant safety \nTreatment algorithms were developed with advice from local diabetes specialists who also contributed \nto the initial and follow-up practice-based training sessions for primary care staff involved in diabetes \ncare. The responsibility for prescribing and management decisions remained with the general \npractitioners. Classes of medication were only recommended within licensed indications. Before \ntaking part in the treadmill test, participants completed a pre-test screening questionnaire incorporating \nthe Rose angina questionnaire. If they answered positively to any of the questions, a short medical \nreview was completed by a clinical member of the team. Blood pressure, current medications and \nECG (if available) were also reviewed following strict protocols before a participant was allowed to \nbegin the treadmill test. \n \nStatistical analysis  \nThe additional benefit of the facilitator-led behaviour change intervention on objective measures of \nphysical activity level, medication adherence, and change from baseline in plasma vitamin C and \nsmoking status will be assessed using an intention to treat analysis comparing the intervention and \ncomparison groups, using linear regression for continuous outcomes and a comparison of proportions \nfor binary outcomes. Continuous outcomes will be analysed with adjustment for the baseline value of \nthe outcome, where this has been measured, in order to improve precision. Those participants missing \nthe baseline value will remain included in the analysis by using the missing indicator method, which is \nvalid for pre-randomisation measures in trials [69].  Due to the large number of stratifier categories, \nthere will be no adjustment for stratifiers in order to ensure that estimation of intervention effects is \nstable. The modelled ten-year cardiovascular risk will be log transformed before analysis and \ncomputed for those with and without a history of previous CVD events. The primary intention to treat \nanalysis will be supported by per protocol analyses of primary outcomes, where the per protocol \n  Page 14 of 23 \npopulation is defined to be those participants attending the introductory and initial three core \nintervention sessions. The impact of missing primary outcome data will be examined within sensitivity \nanalyses using the multiple imputation method of Rubin [70]. This will involve fitting an imputation \nmodel from the observed data, from which missing data will be imputed under two opposing \nscenarios. In the first scenario it is assumed that the same full intervention-minus-comparison effect \napplies amongst participants with missing data as has been observed amongst their counterparts with \nobserved data. In the second scenario it is assumed that the intervention-minus-comparison effect is \nzero for participants with missing data. Ten complete datasets will be imputed, as recommended, to \nincorporate the uncertainty in the residuals and parameter estimates of the imputation model. \nSubgroup analyses will be confined to the comparison of intervention effects on primary outcomes by \nthe route of diagnosis (screen-detected versus already-diagnosed).  \n \nThe perspective for cost analysis will be the health service and will include recent use of services (GP \n\/ hospital appointments & admissions) and prescribed medications in the previous 3 months. The costs \nof intensive treatment with and without the facilitator-led behaviour change intervention will be \ncompared with unit change in health utility. In addition, costs at one-year and future costs derived \nfrom existing data [71] will be compared with risk of death and cardiovascular events, with \nappropriate sensitivity analysis.  \n \nCohort analyses will be reported separately and will test causal pathways between behavioural \ndeterminants, behaviour change and consequences of behaviour change. \n \nSample size \nThe trial was designed within the main ADDITION-Cambridge trial. It was anticipated that 500 \npatients would participate in the ADDITION-Plus trial and that 200 individuals per group would be \navailable with follow-up data. With these numbers, there is 80% power at the 5% level of significance \nlevel to detect the following relevant differences between arms in primary outcomes: \n \nPhysical activity: \nA 0.017 kJ\/kg\/min difference in PAEE. This is based on a standard deviation of 0.058 at \nbaseline in the ProActive trial dataset [72] with mean 0.078. A 0.017 absolute difference \nrepresents a 22% relative difference in mean energy expenditure between groups. \nDiet: \nA 5.5 umol\/l difference in plasma vitamin C (control group mean 53, SD 19, EPIC study \n[73]). Adjustment for baseline level in the analysis allows a finer difference of 4.0 umol\/l to be \ndetected between arms (EPIC test-rest correlation of 0.67). \n \n  Page 15 of 23 \nMedication adherence: \nA 10% absolute difference in the proportion of low adherers to hypoglycaemic medications \n(control group 18%, Supported Adherence to Medication pilot study [51]). \n \nSmoking: \nA 9.5% absolute difference in the proportion smoking (control group 17.9%). \n \nDiscussion \n \nThe ADDITION-Plus trial is designed to establish the medium-term effectiveness and cost-\neffectiveness of a facilitator-led intervention tailored to support change in multiple behaviours among \nintensively-treated individuals with recently diagnosed diabetes in primary care. Key features of this \ntrial include (i) a carefully characterised target group and intervention; (ii) an intervention based on \ntheory and evidence from psychology to support change in key behaviours affecting CVD risk \u2013 \nphysical activity, dietary intake, medication adherence and smoking; (iii) quality assured delivery \nenabled by training, ongoing supervision and protocols; (iv) objective measurements of  behaviours as \nwell as self-report of behaviours, functional status and well-being, and; (v) an examination of the \npsychological, socio-demographic and clinical predictors of behaviour change as well as the clinical \nconsequences of behaviour change in the cohort.  \n \nResults will inform policy recommendations concerning the introduction of health trainer initiatives \nout-with the primary-secondary care team to assist in early management of patients with type 2 \ndiabetes. They will inform both the education of patients and practitioners, the quality assurance of \nbehaviour change programmes, and will improve understanding of the association between changes in \nhealth behaviours and health outcomes. \n \nCompeting interests \nThe authors declare that they have no competing interest.   \n \nAuthors\u2019 contributions:   \nSJG, NJW, SS and ALK are the principal investigators for the ADDITION-Plus trial.
