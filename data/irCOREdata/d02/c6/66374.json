The focus\nhas been largely on the elaboration of conceptual models\nand theories and the development of teaching and training\napproaches; much less effort has been devoted to empirical\nresearch investigating the impact of such developments and\nbuilding up a body of knowledge.\nIn order to promote an agenda for research as well as\nreporting on what has been done, we make a distinction\nbetween research and scholarship, between investigating\nwhat is and developing what ought to be happening in\nteaching and learning. We also distinguish between work\non foreign language and second language teaching, a socio-\nlogical distinction important in the cultural dimension.\nIn the final part of the article we analyse teaching and\ncurriculum development reported in the literature, and find\nan emphasis on approaches which draw on ethnographic\ntechniques and theory, on approaches from critical theory\nand the politics of language teaching, and on teaching of\ncultural knowledge.\nThere is more need, we argue, for interaction between\nthose who teach in general education and those who work\nin cross-cultural training in the business world. Finally we\npoint out that the cultural dimension of language teaching\nis value-laden, that researchers need to be aware of this and\nof the inevitability of engagement with values in teaching\nand researching the cultural dimension.\n1. Introduction\nWe could claim in 1986 (Byram, 1986) that the\nterm \u2018cultural studies\u2019 was not widely used in foreign\nlanguage teaching. In the meantime, attention to\nthe cultural dimension has much increased here as\nin other disciplines, and in the last two decades,\nan increasing number of people working in foreign\nor second language education have developed their\nteaching theories and applications under the umbrella\nof teaching culture for intercultural competence. In\nparallel with this, developments in the field of training\nprogrammes for personnel to work in a multicultural\nsetting or in another culture, have also gathered speed.\nHowever, the two have not had as much mutual\ninfluence and contact as they might.\nThe situation with research is different. The\nflourish in work on teaching and theories of teaching\nhas not been accompanied by empirical research on\nthe causal relationships at work in intercultural com-\npetence. There is little to parallel research on causal\nrelationships between motivation and acquisition\nof linguistic competence, for example. It is only if\nconceptual work on what and how to teach is in-\ncluded under the umbrella term of \u2018research\u2019 that\nthe picture becomes more encouraging. There is\na need for more empirical research but also for a\nresearch agenda such that we can build up a systematic\nknowledge of language-and-culture teaching, the\nacquisition of intercultural competence by learners\ninside and beyond the traditional classroom, the\nrelationship between linguistic and intercultural\ncompetence, the effect of both or either of these\non social identities, and so on.\nIn the first part of this review article we shall\npresent a distinction between research and scholarship\nwhich we hope provides a framework for setting\na clear agenda, illustrated by discussion of existing\nMichael Byram is Professor of Education at the University\nof Durham, England. He has published several books\nincluding, most recently, Teaching and Assessing Intercul-\ntural Communicative Competence; Language Teachers,\nPolitics and Cultures (with Karen Risager); Intercultural\nExperience and Education (edited with G. Alred and M.\nFleming); and is the editor of the Routledge Encyclopedia\nof Language Teaching and Learning. He is a Programme\nAdviser to the Council of Europe Language Policy\nDivision, and is currently interested in language education\npolicy and the politics of language teaching.\nAnwei Feng teaches intercultural studies and bilin-\ngualism modules to postgraduate students and supervises\nEducation Doctorate and PhD students at the University\nof Durham. His research interests include intercultural\nstudies in language education, bilingual education, inter-\ncultural business communication and TESOL.

One significant point here is that research on\nteaching and learning for intercultural competence\ncannot avoid questions of ideology and values. In the\nsecond part, we shall focus on teaching and curri-\nculum development as reported in current literature.\nFinally, we return to the question of research and\nimplicit values, and an expectation that researchers\ndeal with these in a way which has not been seen in\nmost work on learning and teaching language.\n2. Research and scholarship\n2.1 Definitions\nResearch in the \u2018sciences of education\u2019 \u2013 to use a des-\nignation borrowed from some European traditions \u2013\ncan be broadly categorised under three headings:\nwork which seeks to establish explanations in terms of\ncause and effect, work which seeks to understand the\nexperience of people involved in education, andwork\nwhich attempts to create change. The distinction\nbetween \u2018explanation\u2019 (Erkla\u00a8ren) and \u2018understanding\u2019\n(Verstehen\u2019) was made by von Wright (1971) for\nthe social sciences in general, but in addition the\nsciences of education also often attempt to intervene\nand to change the phenomena which educationists\nstudy; researchers have opinions and try to influence\nfor example modes of teaching and learning or\nthe development and implementation of education\npolicy. Furthermore, educationists who wish to inter-\nvene and change things, do so from a particular\nstandpoint. Such educationists will have a view on\nwhat ought to be, and not just on what is. They may\nattempt to intervene in \u2018what is\u2019, and find ways of\ndeveloping from \u2018what is\u2019 towards what they think\n\u2018ought to be\u2019.\nThese various distinctions apply to work on the\ncultural dimensions of second and foreign language\nlearning too. There is, for example, work in the first\ncategory, which attempts to investigate the causal\nrelationships assumed to exist between language\nlearning and attitudes towards other people and\ncultural groups (Morgan, 1993); this is work which\nis looking for explanations (Erkla\u00a8ren). There is other\nwork which attempts to understand, from the per-\nspective of the learners, their experience of other\ncultures and groups (Verstehen). And of course there\nis work in the third category on the development of\ncurricula and methods of teaching or on policies of\nteaching or assessment, which is undertaken in order\nto move contemporary practices towards new\nobjectives.\nThe first-order distinctions which we shall use to\ndiscuss work on the cultural dimension of second\nand foreign language learning will be designated as\n\u2018research\u2019 and \u2018scholarship\u2019, the former seeking for\nexplanation or understanding, two different perspec-\ntives on \u2018what is\u2019, the latter attempting to establish\n\u2018what ought to be\u2019, and sometimes attempting to im-\nplement and evaluate \u2018what ought to be\u2019. We shall\nthus use a threefold categorisation in our analysis of\nthe literature in following sections, reflecting two\nkinds of \u2018research\u2019 and one kind of \u2018scholarship\u2019.\nHowever the more fundamental distinction is be-\ntween investigating \u2018what is\u2019 and advocating \u2018what ought\nto be\u2019. The focus of both kinds of research is on\nanalysis and description of the existing situation,\nwhereas the focus of scholarship is on what develop-\nments should be pursued in the future and why.\nThe distinctions we are making are not matters\nof research method or design. We are not following\nthe distinction frequently made between quantitative\nand qualitative research, because this is in our view a\nsecond-order distinction. Research which is explan-\natory in purpose can draw on quantitative and qualit-\native methods and data, as can research which is\nsearching for understanding, or scholarship attempt-\ning to advocate and introduce new practices. It is also\nself-evident, that the same individuals may work as\nboth researchers and scholars, sometimes investigating\nwhat is and sometimes advocating what ought to be.\nThe topics which researchers and scholars pursue\narise from personal interest, from social demand as\nreflected in funding arrangements, or some com-\nbination of these, and there are numerous aspects of\nlanguage teaching and learning which have culture-\nspecific implications which are of interest to particular\nsocieties or individuals. One is the question of\nwhether different traditions and conceptions of learn-\ning in general are relevant to how languages are learnt.\nFor example, there is a debate on whether learners\nof the \u2018Confucian heritage cultures\u2019 learn languages\nmore successfully through methods of rote-learning\nor \u2018memorising with understanding\u2019 (Feng, 2003;\nHu, 1996; Watkins & Biggs, 2001). Similarly there\nare questions about the impact of societal conditions\non motivation for language learning, for example\nwhether learners in anglophone societies are willing\nto learn foreign languages (Reynolds, 2001). It is\nalso possible to study policies for language education,\nwhere both the specific conditions of a particular\nregion or state and the general theorising about policy\nstudies are a central focus of concern (Ager, 2001).\nHowever, all of these and similar perspectives are\noutside our main focus, which is concerned with\nteaching and learning processes and outcomes, and\nin the following sections we shall consider these by\nusing the two fundamental categories of research and\nscholarship.\n2.2 Researching foreign language\nteaching-and-learning\nThe research questions which can be asked about cul-\nture learning in a foreign language learning context\ndepend partly on whether the researcher is seeking\nexplanation or understanding. From an expla-\nnation perspective, hypotheses about the relation-\nships among culture learning and other aspects of\n150\n\u25a0 Culture and language learning\nlearning and teaching can be quickly established, for\nexample:\n\u0002 The relationship between \u2018the\u2019 foreign culture, or\nperceptions of it, and the motivation for learning\n\u0002 The relationship between language learning and\nattitudes to and\/or perceptions of other cultures and\npeoples\n\u0002 The relationship between teaching methodologies\nand knowledge about other cultures\n\u0002 The relationship between learning (about) another\nculture and learners\u2019 perceptions of and\/or attitudes\ntowards their own culture\n\u0002 The relationship between culture teaching (or\nabsence thereof ) and vocabulary learning\n\u0002 The relationship between culture learning and the\ndevelopment of specific social identities, particularly\nnational identity.\nThe best researched account of culture learning is\nundoubtedly the search for explanation of relation-\nships between learners\u2019 understanding of other\ncultures and their motivation and achievement in\nlanguage learning. This is an area which has been\ndealt with elsewhere in Language Teaching (Do\u00a8rnyei,\n1998) but it is important to note that in early\nresearch by Gardner & Lambert (1972), the notion\nof \u2018integrative\u2019 motivation \u2013 the desire to learn a\nlanguage to be in some sense closer to speakers of the\nlanguage, and part of their culture \u2013 was considered\nthe best basis for success. Later research (Do\u00a8rnyei,\n1998) has shown that \u2018instrumental\u2019 motivation can\nbe more important than \u2018integrative\u2019, depending on\nthe social context in which languages are learnt. Later\nresearch has also shown that many other factors need\nto be taken into consideration, not least the impact\nof classroom conditions (Do\u00a8rnyei, 2001). Where a\nlanguage is dissociated in learners\u2019 perceptions from\nall links with native-speakers \u2013 as may be the case\nwith English as an International Language \u2013 then\n\u2018instrumental\u2019 or \u2018pragmatic\u2019 motivation will be the\nbetter concept for explaining achievement.\nOn the other hand, integrative motivation ex-\npressed as a positive interest in peoples and cultures\nassociated with a language, is still a significant area of\nresearch. This aspect of motivation \u2013 it is only one\naspect of a very complex issue \u2013 is also related to\nresearch on attitudes. In both cases, assumptions that\nthere are linear and uni-directional causal relation-\nships between attitudes or motivation on the one\nhand and achievement in language learning on the\nother are misplaced. It is for this reason that re-\nsearchers have constructed complex models which\nattempt to show the inter-relationships among atti-\ntudes, motivations, self-concepts, environmental\nfactors and instructional factors. The complexity of\nsuch models may appear, to applied linguists and\nteachers, to limit severely their usefulness for teach-\ning, and when Do\u00a8rnyei & Csizer (1998) offer \u2018ten\ncommandments for motivating language learners\u2019\nbased on research, these might seem intuitively self-\nevident but nonetheless reassuring because of their\nbase in research. The significance of culture learning\nis reinforced by their including \u2018familiarise learners\nwith the target language culture\u2019.\nThe causal relationship between language learning\nand teaching and culture learning in the form of in-\nsights and attitudes is one which has been researched,\nalbeit sparingly. Byram, Esarte-Sarries and Taylor\n(1991) investigated the effects of different styles of\nlanguage and culture teaching on learners\u2019 percep-\ntions and understanding of a national culture. Their\nconclusions were disappointing in the sense that they\ncould find no discernible effect of teaching, but a\nstrong presence of other factors from outside the\nclassroom and the school. More recently Australian\nresearchers have investigated the relationship of teach-\ning to attitude formation, which again is disappoint-\ning in that there seems to be no causal relationship\nbetween teaching and positive attitudes (Ingram &\nO\u2019Neill, 2002).\nThere is therefore a major area in the relationships\nbetween on the one hand teaching and on the other\nunderstanding of and attitudes towards self and other,\nown and foreign cultures, which needs much more\nresearch. Such research could be informed and en-\nriched by comparative work on culture learning,\ncomparing for example culture-specific views and\nreactions to communicative language teaching in\nChina and \u2018the West\u2019 (Rao, 2002), in Colombia\nand the USA (Schulz, 2001). There is a particularly\nwell-mined seam of research on vocabulary differ-\nences between, for example, English and Chinese\n(Cortazzi & Shen, 2001) or English and German\n(Olk, 2002) or French and English (Boers &\nDemecheleer, 2001). In most cases research which\nthus analyses speakers\u2019 understanding of apparently\nsimilar vocabulary draws out implications for teaching\nand learning and is thus linked to scholarship which\nargues for particular aims and methods. Vocabulary\nteaching, as we shall see, is a particular focus in\nscholarship too.\nThere are also analyses of cultural differences in\nother aspects of communication: different values and\ncommunication styles (FitzGerald, 2003), or different\ndiscourse strategies (Orsoni, 2001).\nResearch which is focused on understanding rather\nthan explanation may not always appear to have\nimmediate relevance to applied linguists and language\nteachers, particularly when it deals with phenomena\noutside the classroom. This is nonetheless an impor-\ntant area because it situates language and culture\nlearning in social contexts. Lantolf (1999, 2000a,\n2000b) has argued for a theoretical position which\nrecognises the value of understanding processes of\nculture learning from the perspective of learners in\ninformal learning contexts. Pavlenko and Lantolf\nhave used personal stories as a basis for analysing\n151\nCulture and language learning \u25a0\n\u2018second language learning as participation and the\n(re)construction of selves\u2019 (2000). There are recent\nstudies which analyse problems of \u2018identity loss\u2019 as\nchildren learn languages (Downes, 2001; Jo, 2001)\nor \u2018identity maintenance\u2019 for children of minority\ngroups learning their heritage language (Mills, 2001).\nThe particular role of the textbook in supporting\nlearners\u2019 identity has also been analysed (Arbex,\n2001).\nThe learners in some of these studies are from\nminority groups or find themselves in an identity-\nthreatening situation, and there is also a growing\nresearch interest in the impact of language and\nculture learning on the cultural identities of learners\nin majority groups, especially when they spend\ntime in another country to improve their learning\n(Crawshaw, Callen & Tusting, 2001; Jordan, 2001).\nRelated research investigates the interplay between\nsocial context, perceptions of self and language\nlearning (Miller, 2003).\n2.3 Scholarship and foreign\nlanguage teaching\nWork which we classify as scholarship, concerned\nwith intervention in the status quo of foreign\nlanguage learning in order to develop it in a certain\ndirection, is far more frequent than research. Whereas\nthe quality of research will be judged by criteria of\nclarity of conceptual analysis, validity and reliability of\nquantitative data or authenticity and trustworthiness\nof qualitative data, and rigour in interpreting and\ndrawing conclusions from data, scholarly work is\noften judged by the power of the argument and\nthe rhetoric which sustains it, by the relevance of\nthe argument to a given time and place, and by the\nsupport cited from research. Argument about \u2018what\nought to be\u2019 may depend more or less closely on\nresearch and the analysis of \u2018what is\u2019. Proposals for\nfuture directions may be judged, irrespective of re-\nsearch, as \u2018realistic\u2019 or \u2018unrealistic\/ideal\u2019. Scholarship\nreflects, more than research, the relationship of\nlanguage learning and teaching to the social condi-\ntions in which it is located. As the contemporary\nworld changes to a state of \u2018globalisation\u2019, for\nexample, arguments about culture learning have\nchanged too.\nContemporary scholarship is therefore concerned\nwith and a reflection of social and political contexts,\nand the responses of theorists and social commen-\ntators. In Germany, for example, Kramer (1997) has\nargued for attention to a \u2018cultural studies\u2019 dimension\nto the teaching of English which has its roots in\nthe critical social analysis of Raymond Williams and\nStuart Hall in England. Kramer argues that the study\nof English (Anglistik) needs to respond to the new\nways in which people live their lives, engage in\ntheir culture, in a time of rapid change. The study\nof language and culture should address questions of\n\u2018how we live\u2019 and also \u2018how we ought to live\u2019, thus\nintroducing an explicitly ethical dimension to teach-\ning and learning. Starkey, too, introduces a strong\nethical dimension by arguing that language and\nculture teaching should take note of and introduce\nhuman rights education into its aims and purposes\n(Starkey, 2002).\nChanging social conditions are reflected in the\nwork of Kramsch and Zarate. The former argues,\nlike Kramer, for new purposes and re-definitions\nof language study to respond to \u2018epistemological\nshifts occurring in academia\u2019 (1995: XIV) and her\nargument that language study creates \u2018a third place\u2019,\na privileged and questioning location, where learners\ngain special insights into their own and others\ncultures, has become widely accepted. Zarate (2003),\ntoo, redefines the nature and purposes of language\nand culture learning, stressing the significance of in-\nbetween or border locations and the need for lan-\nguage teaching to respond to the particular challenges\nof European integration, as nation states and national\nidentities fuse and change.\nSuch authors present new perspectives and pur-\nposes. By doing so they open up new questions for\nresearch and scholarship. For example, researchers\nmight explore the self-understanding of learners and\nteachers living in these newly defined conditions.\nScholars who are interested in intervention and\ndevelopment work can find guidance in their\nplanning from these new purposes, and new teaching\nobjectives which follow from them.\nThere are some signs of this in intervention and\ndevelopment work already, although the analysis of\nthe relationship of classroom practice to pedagogical\naims and ethical questions is not frequent enough.\nWe reviewed recent publications abstracted in\nLanguage Teaching and concluded that intervention\nand development work is currently often focused on\nthe \u2018problems\u2019 of difference and distance, and how\nto overcome them. One example of this is work on\nteaching vocabulary, mentioned earlier, where tea-\nchers attempt to teach differences through \u2018culturally\nloaded\u2019 words (Qi, 2001; Galisson, 2000). Another is\nthe use of language corpora to teach differences in\npragmatics (Berrier, 2001).\nCulture learning is perceived as less feasible if\nconfined to the classroom than language learning.\nIt needs to be experiential and experience of differ-\nence has to be at the centre of learners\u2019 and teachers\u2019\nattention. Unsurprisingly, new communication tech-\nnologies are promoted as a means of overcoming\ndistance and giving learners experience of interact-\ning with native speakers. Email contacts (Liaw &\nJohnson, 2001; Belz, 2001; Jogan, Heredia &\nAguilera, 2001), electronic conferencing (Truscott\n& Morley, 2001) and the internet as a source of\ninformation (Herron et al., 2002; Gruber-Miller &\nBenton, 2001) are representative of this trend.\nTandem-learning, originally developed as a means of\n152\n\u25a0 Culture and language learning\nenhancing linguistic competence, is a means of creat-\ning opportunities for culture learning (Rohrbach &\nWiniger, 2001; Ko\u00a8tter, 2001). Where visits and\nexchanges are offered to language learners for\nthe same purposes, there are similar attempts to\ncreate culture learning (Gohard-Radenkovic, 2001;\nHarbon, 2002; Breugnot, 2001).\nImplicit in these approaches is the assumption that\ninteraction with people who embody a culture, who\nare native speakers of a language, is crucial. This then\nleads to debate and argument for (and against) the\nuse of native speakers as teachers (Hinkel, 2001; Jiang,\n2001). The debate about the advantages of non-\nnative and native speakers with respect to teaching\nlanguage (Medgyes, 1994; Widdowson, 2003: 156)\nis thus beginning to be extended to teaching\nculture, and the related question of the relationship\nbetween teachers\u2019 experience of other cultures\nand their introduction of a cultural dimension into\ntheir teaching is being investigated (Aleksandrowicz-\nPedich & Lazar, 2002).\nAnalysis of the cultural content of textbooks is a\nwell-established area and insofar as it has begun to\ndevelop theoretically well-founded criteria, might be\nbetter classified as research into the effects of teaching\non learners\u2019 perceptions (Sercu, 2000). Reports on\nthe difficulties of using textbooks written in one\ncountry when teaching in another (Yakhontova,\n2001) are however like reports of difficulties of using\nWestern communication technology in non-Western\ncountries (Smith, 2001; Takagaki, 2001; Feng &\nByram 2002). The authors adopt a more inter-\ncultural perspective in content analysis, and argue\nfor intercultural representation in selecting textbook\nmaterials and analysis of intention and interpretation\nin handling authentic texts in the classroom. Here\nthe scholarly purpose, the argument for a viewpoint\nis quite explicit.\n2.4 Research and scholarship in second\nlanguage teaching-and-learning\nThe distinction between foreign and second language\nlearning is often considered by those concerned\nwith Second Language Acquisition research as un-\nimportant. Research on \u2018bilingual education\u2019 where\nstudents learn through the medium of another\nlanguage than their first or dominant language would\nnot make a distinction between learners who are\nimmigrants to another country learning through the\nofficial language of that country, and indigenous\nlearners who simply go to a school where it has\nbeen decided to teach them through the medium\nof another language. It is however important when\nthinking about the cultural issues involved. There\nis the inevitability of some kind of culture learning\nwhen learners live in another culture, as immigrants,\nin contrast to the lack of such learning outside the\nclassroom in the case of indigenous learners. The\nlatter are exposed to language learning only in the\nclassroom. The learning of English is however a spe-\ncial case in many countries, because of the dominance\nof English-language media, and the inevitable ex-\nposure to manifestations of US American culture.\nWhere some Second Language Acquisition re-\nsearch does make a distinction is between tutored and\nuntutored learning, the latter often being the experi-\nence of adult immigrants whereas child immigrants\nare provided with formal, tutored language learning\nopportunities (Perdue, 2000). Despite the distinction,\nthis research seeks to answer questions about the\nacquisition of language as a system, what paths are\ntaken by learners, what relationships there are among\nattitudes and motivation factors, why they stop learn-\ning so that their language fossilises. Further questions\nwhich need to be asked concern how people, children\nand adults, acquire the concepts of their new cultural\nenvironment, the \u2018keywords\u2019 which distinguish one\nlanguage from another (Wierzbicka, 1997b) the \u2018rich\npoints\u2019 of a culture (Agar, 1991). As Lantolf puts\nit:\nAlthough it may be possible for people to develop an intellectual\nunderstanding and tolerance of other cultures, a more interesting\nquestion, perhaps, is if, and to what extent, it is possible for\npeople to become cognitively like members of other cultures;\nthat is, can adults learn to construct and see the world through\nculturally different eyes. (1999: 29)\nLantolf then provides a useful survey of research\nwhich has examined the acquisition of lexis and\nmetaphors, but points out that this is still at an early\nstage.\nAnother recent development is beginning to\nextend the range of interest of Second Language\nAcquisition in the way we have suggested is necessary.\nNorton (2000) argues that language acquisition is\ninfluenced by social relationships, by the social\nidentities which immigrants are allowed to develop\nby the society in which they live. By careful case\nstudies, she shows that the questions concerning the\nrate of acquisition, motivation, fossilisation, precisely\nthose questions which focus on language as a system,\ncan be better explained by attention to the social\nconditions and the social identities present in the\nexperience. Miller (2003) has carried out similar\nwork with children, studying in depth the cases of ten\nimmigrant children in Australia, to analyse the ways\nin which their self-representations impact on their\nlanguage acquisition. Both of these are looking for\nexplanation but also seek to understand the experience\nfrom learners\u2019 perspectives.\nIn an attempt to understand the experience,\nparticularly of adult language learners, Pavlenko\n(1998) has analysed autobiographical accounts of\nlanguage learning, notably in what she describes as\n\u2018acclaimed literary masterpieces\u2019 whose authors have\ndemonstrated a heightened sensitivity and ability to\nrecall and reflect on their learning experience. What\n153\nCulture and language learning \u25a0\nis particularly interesting is that, though she starts\nwith a focus on Second Language Acquisition and\na search for further insight into the acquisition of\nlanguage as system, she ends with questions about\nidentity, about the possible incompatibilities of living\nin two languages. The people she cites, though\nhighly sensitive and articulate authors, such as Ewa\nHoffmann, Julien Green or Salman Rushdie, are not\nlanguage and culture theorists. There is very little\nreflection by bilingual linguists on their experience,\nyet the examples of Wierzbicka (1997a) and Paulston\n(1992) suggest that there is rich potential for those\nresearchers who have similar experience.\nIn second language learning, then, there are more\nquestions than answers, and research is only just\nbeginning, but the distinction between \u2018pure\u2019 re-\nsearch and \u2018committed\u2019 scholarship, is just as valid.\n3. Teaching and curriculum development\nOur distinction between research and scholarship\nmeans that we take the view that the relationship\nbetween teaching and research\/scholarship is deter-\nmined by the \u2018scholars\u2019 rather than \u2018researchers\u2019, those\nwho have a specific view of \u2018what ought to be\u2019\nin teaching and learning, \u2018what ought to be\u2019 the\npurposes, processes and outcomes. In the following\nwe shall see that this is reflected in work which\nintroduces new approaches to teaching, in other\nwords work which develops the curriculum towards\nspecific ends with specific underlying values. Even\nwhere work reported in the literature does not\npresent its underlying values, it is inevitable that culture\nteaching is infused with values in ways which language\nteaching can avoid.\nThree main perspectives are identifiable in views\nonwhat ought to be done in teaching for intercultural\ncompetence and communication, even though there\nis inevitable overlap among them:\n\u0002 Culture teaching is moving towards an ethnographic\nperspective;\n\u0002 Culture teaching is moving towards a critical\nperspective;\n\u0002 Culture teaching focuses on preparation for resi-\ndence in another country, often without attention\nto language learning.\nThe first two perspectives are found in the work\nwhich arises from general education, in schooling or\nhigher education. The third is associated more with\nthe world of work, business and commerce.\nBefore considering these three in more detail,\nwe start with discussions of context in language\neducation as these discussions seem to formulate the\nmajor thrust in theorising contemporary efforts in\nlanguage and culture teaching. This is followed by a\npresentation of general theoretical underpinnings of\nthe approaches in question respectively, with major\nworks reviewed for specific arguments and practical\nideas of culture teaching.\n3.1 Context and language-and-culture\nteaching\nMost of the recent literature on teaching culture\nhas apparently arisen from the increasing importance\nattached to context in theoretical discussions in\nsociolinguistics, cultural studies teaching and inter-\ncultural communication. Hymes (1974) identifies\neight factors that he takes as essential aspects to make\nup context in interpersonal communication. He\nwittily summarises them in the acronym SPEAKING\nwhich stands for setting (time and place), participants,\nend (purpose), act sequence (form and content of\nan utterance), key (tone and nonverbal clues), instru-\nmentalities (choice of channel and of code), norms of\ninteraction and interpretation, and genre. In language\nand culture teaching, Kramsch\u2019s (1993) monograph\nencapsulated this in the title Context and Culture\nin Language Teaching. In discussing interrelationships\nbetween texts people generate and contexts shaping\nthem or shaped by them, Halliday (1989) coins the\nnotion of intertextual context by which he refers to\nhistorical factors and the accumulation of all other\ncontextual aspects. He asserts that in communication\nin general the past and the present experiences come\ntogether to shape the intertextual context.\nGudykunst & Kim (1992) argue that in intercul-\ntural interactions two types of context come into play,\nexternal context and internal context. The former refers\nto the settings or locations where the interaction\ntakes place and the meanings the society attaches\nto them, whereas the latter, internal context, is\nthe culture the interactants bring to the encounters.\nIn intercultural communication, misunderstanding is\nmuch more likely to occur because the internal cont-\nexts, that is, the methods interactants use to perceive\nthe situations and each other and the meanings they\nassociate with the settings, can differ greatly from one\nculture to another. Thus, it is essential for language\nlearners to be effective in culture learning.\nThese views are largely shared by Kramsch (ibid.)\nwho summarises the discussions of the notion of\ncontext along five lines: linguistic, situational, inter-\nactional, cultural and intertextual. She argues that\nteachers need to help learners of foreign languages\ndiscover the potential meanings through explorations\nof the context of the discourse under study. The\nmore contextual clues learners can identify, the\nmore likely their learning becomes meaningful.\nThe fruits of this view can now be seen in con-\ntemporary collections of articles and monographs\ndescribing classroom methods which focus on the\ninterplay between language and culture (for example:\nFantini, 1997; Lo Bianco, Liddicoat & Crozet, 1999;\nMorgan & Cain, 2000; Moran, 2001; Byram &\nGrundy, 2002).\n154\n\u25a0 Culture and language learning\n3.2 Ethnographic approaches\nThe extensive discussions on context have resulted,\nfirst of all, in the view of adopting systematically an\nethnographic approach to culture learning and teach-\ning. The practice of ethnography originates from an-\nthropology and was initially a research methodology\ndeveloped by anthropologists such as Malinowski\n(1922) to study exotic societies by living with local\ninhabitants, that is, by observing their culture \u2018from\ninside\u2019. Malinowski (1923) also asserted on the basis\nof his ethnographic study that one could under-\nstand a language in its context of situation, arguing\nthat meaning only comes from real and active\nparticipation in relevant situations.\nIn the past few decades, the ethnographic approach\nhas gained currency in the literature of sociolin-\nguistics. Particularly since Hymes (1974) proposed an\nethnographic framework which takes into account\nvarious factors involved in speaking, the ethnographic\napproach has been adopted repeatedly by sociolin-\nguistic researchers to conduct empirical studies into\nthe interrelationships between language and society\n(e.g., Hill & Hill, 1986; Milroy, 1987; Lindenfeld,\n1990). Sociolinguists usually define ethnography as\na disciplined way to observe, ask, record, reflect,\ncompare, analyse and report. Hymes further notes\nthat:\nOf all forms of scientific knowledge, ethnography is the most\nopen, the most compatible with a democratic way of life, the least\nlikely to produce a world in which experts control knowledge at\nthe expense of those who are studied. The skills of ethnography\nare enhancements of skills all normal persons employ in everyday\nlife. . . . It (ethnography) mediates between what members of a\ngiven community know and do, and accumulates comparative\nunderstanding of what members of communities generally have\nknown and done. (1981: 57)\nEthnography has attracted language educators partly\nbecause access to countries where a target language\nis spoken has become increasingly easier for language\nlearners, and partly because language educators and\nscholars have realised that language teaching can\nbenefit from application of other disciplines rather\nthan drawing solely on theoretical linguistics. The\nvalue of ethnography is particularly noticeable as the\nliterature on culture learning and cultural studies\nteaching has grown and was present already in\nsome of the earliest writings. Discussions about\nthe close relationship between language and socio-\ncultural patterns in the literature of cultural studies,\nanthropology and sociolinguistics prompted language\neducation scholars such as Paulston (1974), McLeod\n(1976), Damen (1987) and Byram (1989a) to examine\nthe relevance of anthropological, sociolinguistic and\ncultural studies methodology for language and culture\nteaching.\nMore recently, coupled with social changes of the\nlate twentieth century that are encapsulated in the\nwords \u2018globalisation\u2019 and \u2018internationalisation\u2019, an\nincreasing number of educational institutions par-\nticularly in the industrialised countries have\ndeveloped programmes for students to study abroad.\nMost of these programmes are claimed to be part of\ntheir agendas to internationalise educational systems\n(Murphy-Lejeune, 2002; Kauffmann et al., 1992) and\nmany have the dual purposes of improving profi-\nciency in the target language and developing their\nintercultural competence and ethnographic skills\n(Byram, 1989b; Coleman, 1995; Roberts, Byram,\nBarro, Jordan & Street, 2001).\n3.2.1 Ethnographic study in naturalistic\nsettings\nAn ethnographic perspective in language education,\nfirst of all, takes naturalistic settings as most effective\nand central to culture learning. This view is best\nillustrated in the literature on study abroad. Accord-\ning to Murphy-Lejeune (2002), in 1996, UNESCO\nestimated that the number of internationally mobile\nstudents reached 1,400,000 worldwide and projected\nan increase of 50,000 students each year in the years\nto come. For example, in the 1990s, the United States\ndispatched approximately 71,000 undergraduates\neach year to other countries (Freed, 1995), and in\nEurope, under the European Union\u2019s SOCRATES\nprogramme alone, nearly 200,000 students study\nabroad each year (Coleman, 1997). The ethnographic\nexperience of these internationally mobile students\nattracts the attention of researchers of various discip-\nlines including those in language and culture learning\nand acquisition. Research findings, particularly those\nobtained from in-depth interviews, often show a\nclose relationship between students\u2019 ethnographic ex-\nperience and their intellectual development (includ-\ning development of learners\u2019 linguistic competence)\n(Dyson, 1988; DeKeyser, 1991), international per-\nspectives and positive attitudes towards otherness\n(Carlson et al., 1990; Kauffmann et al., 1992;\nMurphy-Lejeune, 2002). In her summary article of\ninterviews of 50 students who spent a year in a\nEuropean country other than in their own, Murphy-\nLejeune (2003: 113) states that the experience is\ngenerally positively felt by many interviewees as an\nadaptation process. This process does not always bring\nabout a drastic change in personality but it evidently\nleads to a \u2018personal expansion, an opening of one\u2019s\npotential universe\u2019.\nMany language educators think that these study-\nabroad programmes ought to be opportunities not\nonly to develop learners\u2019 linguistic competence but\ntheir cultural awareness and intercultural competence.\nArmstrong (1984) researched more than a hundred\nhigh-school students who participated in a seven-\nweek language study programme in Mexico and\nfound that the stay positively influenced the students\u2019\nattitude towards the host culture and the target\nlanguage and led to a higher level of cultural\n155\nCulture and language learning \u25a0\nawareness. In the European context, the proximity of\ncountries with different languages and the advantages\nof living in a multilingual continent, have led to\nmajor increases in the number of young learners\nexperiencing other cultures which can be exploited\nwith an ethnographic approach (Byram & Snow,\n1997). This is further encouraged within the\nEuropean Union by the existence of programmes\nof financial support such as COMENIUS, and as\nvisits and exchanges become increasingly frequent,\nlanguage teachers often find it necessary to equip\nthemselves with ethnographic skills (Dark et al.,\n1997).\nHaving studied the effects of studying abroad on\nuniversity-level students, Jurasek (1995) concludes\nthat in learning another language it is important\nfor a learner to engage in the ethnographic process\nof observing, participating, describing, analysing,\nand interpreting. This engagement is much more\nsignificant than the product of the study itself. He\nfurther suggests that as a consequence of such an\napproach learners will raise their awareness with\nregard to perception and perspective and improve\ntheir ability to recognise what things might look\nlike from the perspective of members of another\nculture.\nPerhaps, the most comprehensive ethnographic\nprogramme for language students is the one that was\ndesigned and carried out by researchers at a British\nuniversity (see Roberts, Byram, Barro, Jordan &\nStreet 2001; Barro, Jordan & Roberts, 1998). The\nprogramme was conducted over a period of three\nyears in three distinct phases. During the second year\nof their BA programme, the students were introduced\nto ethnography through a semester-long module.\nAt this initial phase, the students not only acquired\nbasic concepts but also familiarised themselves with\nethnographic methods by interrogating their own\nfamiliar environment and behaviours and reflecting\non taken-for-granted assumptions. Armed with these\nskills, the students then spent their third year abroad to\ncarry out their ethnographic study. In the last phase,\nthey were asked to analyse their \u2018field work\u2019 data and\nwrite up their ethnographic experience in the target\nlanguage. Roberts, Byram, Barro, Jordan & Street\nconclude that:\nLanguage learners as ethnographers are inevitably engaged\nwith the otherness of their new environment not just as an\nopportunity to improve linguistic competence and their ability\nto produce appropriate utterances, but as a whole social being\nwho are developing, defining and being defined in terms of\ntheir interactions with other social beings. As ethnographers\nand intercultural speakers, they negotiate a particular relationship\nwith those around them, a relationship traditionally described\nas participant observation, although this fails to capture the\ncomplexity of the reflexive effect on the linguist-ethnographer.\n(2001: 237)\nMost ethnographic projects such as this and study-\nabroad programmes described above have reportedly\nproduced positive impact on learners in terms of\nintercultural awareness, interest in otherness, intellec-\ntual and personal development. Nevertheless, some\nresearch findings indicate that negative experience in\nforeign countries can reinforce stereotypes (Coleman,\n1998) and some students even feel that the year\nabroad is a \u2018lost year\u2019 as they lose contact with their\nhome school and their fellow students (Lewis &\nStickler, 2000). In response to these, education\nscholars and institutions have used or experimented\nwith various measures to help achieve the specified\naims. These include formal training of students\nbefore residence abroad, as in Roberts, Byram, Barro,\nJordan & Street (2001), regular visits by home institu-\ntions and regular report or diary writing by students\n(Lewis & Stickler, 2000). Most of the measures are\nreported to be effective in bringing about positive\noutcomes.\nIn summary, in his overview article, Coleman\n(1997) points out that preparation is essential for\nbringing about the desired outcome. To optimise the\npositive impact on students studying abroad, clear\nobjectives should be laid down and made familiar\nto all involved. Before and during their residence\nabroad, students ought to be made aware of their own\nmotivation, attitude, aptitude, and learning styles and\ndevelop their ethnographic skills and (meta)cognitive\nand affective strategies.\n3.2.2 Ethnographic study in structured\nsettings\nMuch support is generated for ethnographic learning\nin naturalistic settings to develop students\u2019 skills to\nobserve complex cultural phenomena, to interact\nwith otherness with an open mind and to analyse\nand interpret ethnographic data. Recent literature on\nethnography has also expanded to professional devel-\nopment and culture teaching in a structured language\nclassroom. Language education scholars have ex-\nplored a range of ways in which teachers as well as\nlearners can be encouraged to \u2018live an ethnographic\nlife\u2019, depending on the context of learning and re-\nsources available. Both research findings and theor-\netical discussions demonstrate a strong interest in the\nethnographic perspective for culture learning and\nteaching, whether it takes place in the country where\nthe target language is spoken or in a structured\nlanguage classroom.\nIn discussing ethnography for culture teaching\nand learning in language education, many scholars\nmaintain that teachers first of all need to be ethno-\ngraphers themselves capable of dealing with cultural\nissues with understanding and sensitivity. It is mis-\ntaken to assume that teachers can competently\nprovide explanations of complex issues to their\nstudents by simply drawing on text information\nand personal experience. Damen (1987) is one of\nthe early promoters of ethnography for professional\n156\n\u25a0 Culture and language learning\ndevelopment of language teachers and for culture\nteaching in language classrooms. She suggests seven\nsteps for teachers, pre-service or in-service, to plan\nan individual ethnographic project. She names the\nprocedure \u2018pragmatic ethnography\u2019 because she states\nthat the procedure is to \u2018serve personal and practical\npurposes and not to provide scientific data and\ntheory\u2019 (p. 63). The seven steps are summarised as\nfollows:\n1. Select a target group for ethnographic study\n2. Find informant(s) able to represent the group\n3. Find information about the group through secondary\nsources such as handbooks and journals, etc.\n4. Interview the informant(s)\n5. Analyse the interview data with the information\nobtained from secondary sources to form cultural\nhypotheses\n6. Reflect on own references in order to understand\ngiven behaviours and meanings\n7. Apply the insights into teaching materials selection,\nlesson planning and classroom teaching.\nAlthough this model does not explicitly suggest\nthat the teacher ask the students to use the same\napproach to culture learning, Step 7 attempts to link\nthe teacher\u2019s ethnographic learning experience with\nhis\/her teaching practice.\nVarious innovative techniques using ethnographic\napproach are experimented in many professional\ndevelopment programmes. In a French teacher\ntraining programme, Zarate (1991) required teacher\ntrainees to conduct observation in three localities:\none from a list of localities provided by the trainers,\none that was frequented by the individual trainee,\nand one with relatively pluralistic representations.\nThe trainees were required to keep a diary with\na minimal requirement in format. Though Zarate\npoints out that the gains of this type of training\nare not easy to pinpoint precisely, the challenge\nof culture teaching traditions is clear: the teacher\ntrainees are encouraged to take up a spectator\u2019s\nposition and reflect critically and objectively on the\nculture which they are supposed to deal with in their\nown classrooms.\nLiterature documenting language teachers\u2019 at-\ntempts to study their students\u2019 perceptions of langu-\nage learning, attitudes and classroom behaviour using\nan ethnographic approach is increasing (Canagarajah,\n1993; Atkinson & Ramanathan 1995; Barkhuizen,\n1998). The findings of most of these studies shed\nnew lights on materials selection, lesson planning\nand classroom teaching as Damen expects. That is\nthe very reason why Holliday (1994) argues that\neach time a language teacher meets a new group\nof students or a curriculum planner enters a new\ninstitution she\/he should apply ethnographic skills to\ndiscovering the \u2018hidden agendas\u2019 and life objectives\nof their students. It is the hidden objectives of his\/\nher students that determine whether they accept or\nreject the curricular innovations and the teaching\nand learning methodology used by the teacher. \u2018The\nteacher cannot afford to be anything but a researcher\u2019\n(p. 31). In a later article, Holliday (1996) further states\nthat in ethnographic studies into teaching English\nas an international language a teacher should not\nrestrict research to empirical research on verbal data\nbut develop a \u2018sociological imagination\u2019, the ability\nto locate him\/herself and his\/her actions (as a teacher\ncum researcher) critically within a wider community\nor world scenario.\nIn recent years, evenmore significant is the fact that\nmany attempts have beenmade to equip students with\nethnographic techniques to conduct language-and-\nculture projects themselves in their own classrooms\nand neighbouring communities. Robinson-Stuart &\nNocon (1996) report an experimental study they\ncarried out in an American university. In this study,\nthe students studying Spanish as a foreign language\nwere trained to employ ethnographic interview skills\nto study the local Spanish speakers. Both quantitative\nand qualitative results reveal that most language\nstudents benefited cognitively, affectively and intel-\nlectually as they demonstrated a more positive attitude\ntowards the cultural perspectives of local target\nlanguage speakers, showed more interest in learning\nthe target language and practised the life skill of active\nlistening. In Byram & Cain (1998), an experiment\ncarried out in two schools in France and England\nusing an ethnographic approach is described, arguing\nfor greater efforts in exploring other disciplines\nsuch as anthropology, sociology and ethnography in\nlanguage teaching practice. Carel (2001) reports a\nproject which made use of information technology\nto develop in students cultural sensitivity and inter-\ncultural competence in the classroom. For this, she\ndesigned and implemented an interactive computer\ncourseware package which enabled students to use\nethnographic skills to observe and analyse cultural\nphenomena, to do virtual fieldwork and reflect on\ntheir own culture and their previous views of the\ntarget culture. Similarly, a project in Bulgaria has\nexplored the ways in which the skills of the ethno-\ngrapher in collecting and analysing data and studying\ntheir meanings comparatively with data from one\u2019s\nown culture, can be brought into the classroom\n(e.g., Topuzova, 2001). In his monograph, Corbett\n(2003) also argues for ethnography as one of the most\nimportant features of the intercultural approach. As\nethnographic skills such as observing, interviewing,\nanalysing and reporting are all vital skills for students\nwhen they encounter otherness first hand, these skills\nneed to be trained and incorporated into langu-\nage curricula. He offers practical suggestions and\nmethods to conduct interviews, to make use of\nresources and to explore cultures in general using\nan ethnographic approach. Finally, Fleming (1998,\n2003) shows how drama teaching, as a unique\n157\nCulture and language learning \u25a0\nform of classroom teaching, can be linked with\nethnographic methodology to enable learners to see\nothers\u2019 behaviour and their own through the eyes\nof \u2018made strangers\u2019, a process of active participant\nobservation and reflection.\nThe potential of the internet for virtual ethno-\ngraphy seems obvious but has not yet been fully\nexplored. A project involving learners of French\nin the USA and learners of English in France\ndemonstrated how the interaction can be used for\ncollecting data from fellow learners, analysing and\ncomparing interpretations of \u2018the same\u2019 phenomena\nwhich then leads into in-depth understanding of\ncultural difference (Furstenberg & Levet, 2001).\nThere are also opportunities to use the internet\nto encourage learners to acquire more knowledge\nabout a country (e.g., Osuna & Meskill, 1998) but\nthis is not adding more than an attractive and rapid\nway of acquiring information. For the moment the\nemphasis is on finding ways of enabling learners to\ninteract and learn from each other synchronously\nor asynchronously. Particularly interesting work has\nbeen done in real-time interaction of learners of\nGerman in the USA and learners of English in\nGermany, at university level. One of the advantages\nappears to be that the multimedia environment\nis cognitively demanding and encourages critical\nthinking despite the limited linguistic competence of\nlearners in the early stages of language acquisition\n(von der Emde, Schneider & Ko\u00a8tter, 2001; von\nder Emde & Schneider, 2003). This then leads\nto research not only on the learning involved but\nalso on the nature of the cross-cultural interaction\namong learners using web fora (Hanna & de Nooy,\n2003).\nThe purpose of ethnography is \u2018to make the strange\nfamiliar and the familiar strange\u2019, and we must bear\nin mind that perhaps the prime way of making the\nstrange familiar is through the reading of literature\nfrom another time or place. Kramsch has shown this\non many occasions, most recently in an article in\nwhich she shows how a short story read in a German\nclass can lead to further investigations and research\non her students\u2019 understanding (Kramsch, 2003).\nBredella and his associates have placed literature at the\ncentre of their teaching philosophy and demonstrated\nhow poems, stories and novels can be the foundation\nfor a methodology which develops empathy and\nsensitivity to the lives and cultures of others in\nquite different circumstances (e.g., Delanoy, Ko\u00a8berl &\nTschachler, 1993; Bredella, 2000; Burwitz-Melzer,\n2001).\n3.3 Critical Approaches\nAnother major response of language educators and\nscholars to the ever changing socio-political and eco-\nnomical context is reflected in the heated discussions\non the notion of a critical perspective for language\nand culture teaching.Much of the discussion is clearly\ndriven by three most powerful social and academic\nforces identifiable in today\u2019s world. Firstly, the de-\nbate on the notion of identity fundamentally chal-\nlenges traditional aims and philosophies in education\nin general. The trend of globalisation and interna-\ntionalisation is not an imagined phenomenon but a\ngenuine force changing our society and (re)shaping\ncultural identities of individuals. Many authors in\nBennett (1998), for example, argue that cultural\nidentities of individuals are no longer based solely\non geographical locations or nationality but often,\namong other social factors such as gender, age, eco-\nnomic class, etc., on internalised lived experience in\nmore than one geographic setting incorporatingmore\nthan one culture. The need to \u2018rethink\u2019 cultural\ndifferences and identities is directly related to the issue\nof what kind of world educators should prepare their\nstudents for, and this has clear implications for setting\neducational objectives.\nThe second force that drives the conceptual change\nin the critical direction is taking shape in the literature\nof a critical pedagogy. This is fundamentally an\neducational philosophy to encourage educators to\ntake teaching as a dynamic process of constructing\nknowledge with learners, not as a set course to\ntransmit a body of \u2018hard\u2019 knowledge (Freire, 1974,\n1995, 1998; Giroux, 1992, 1997). In this process,\nfrom the viewpoint of critical pedagogists, students\nshould not be treated as passive consumers but\nconstructors of knowledge who engage in creative\ncultural development. The critical pedagogy is in\nessence developed to encourage critical evaluation\nof existing assumptions regarding the relationships\nbetween culture, nation-states, and national identity\nand to question the presumed norms in a \u2018common\nculture\u2019. The theoretical underpinnings evident in\nthese discussions point directly towards the core issue\nof how culture should be dealt with in a changing\ncontext in terms of social dynamics and educational\nideology.\nThe third major driving force towards a critical ap-\nproach is very direct and is formulated in discussions\namong language educators and linguists themselves\nof the teaching of English in the ever-changing socio-\npolitical context. In particular, the debates on the\neffects of English as an international language or\nlingua franca ( Jenkins, 2000; Knapp & Meierkord,\n2002; Seidlhofer, 2003; Widdowson, 2003) and on\nthe impact of the global spread of English on other less\npowerful languages (Phillipson, 1992; Pennycook,\n1994, 1998; Canagarajah, 1999; Crystal, 2000) have\nresulted in reassessment and redefinition of many\n\u2018common-sense\u2019 perceptions and assumptions with\nrespect to notions such as native speakers, standard\nlanguages, national identities, homogeneous target\ncultures, and revisiting of the firmly-held belief that\nlanguage and culture are inextricably bound together\n(Byram & Risager, 1999; Risager, 2003). These\n158\n\u25a0 Culture and language learning\ndebates and reassessments clearly suggest that the\npragmatic business-as-usual approaches commonly\nadvocated ought to be questioned and strongly\nchallenged. Language educators need to define what\nculture they should teach and explore ways in culture\nteaching in the wider context of general education.\n3.3.1 Culture teaching and political\neducation\nIt is widely acknowledged by educationists and\nlanguage researchers such as those cited immediately\nabove that education is never neutral and foreign lan-\nguage education has a political role to play in any edu-\ncation system of the world. Many scholars and edu-\ncators therefore argue that foreign language teachers\nshould take social and political responsibilities in\nthe education of the young in the contemporary\nworld. Byram (1997a), for example, places political\neducation firmly at the centre of his model for\nintercultural communicative competence on the basis\nof detailed analyses of the political contexts of for-\neign\/second language education in many countries\nincluding those in the Middle East and Europe.\nHe suggests that insights from citizenship education,\neducation for democracy, human rights and peace\neducation, and cultural studies can be drawn to\nestablish criteria of evaluation andmediation between\ncultures. Byram & Risager (1999) further elaborate\nthis stance with data from their empirical studies in\ntwo European countries. They show how geopoli-\ntical changes affect language educators\u2019 perceptions\nof language teaching and analyse and recommend\nways to respond to these changes in language\neducation.\nIn her monograph on critical citizenship, Guil-\nherme puts even greater and more explicit emphasis\non the political dimension for foreign language and\nculture education. She states that:\nEducation is always political and the disciplines dealing with\nlanguage and culture even more so because they involve issues\nof identification and representation. Therefore, it is not critical\ncultural awareness per se that makes foreign language\/culture\neducation political since education \u2018is necessarily political\u2019\n(Wringe, 1984: 43). However, critical cultural awareness makes\nthe political nature of foreign language\/culture education more\nevident by denying that it is neutral even when it intends or\npretends to be so. Foreign language\/culture education has a\npolitical role which, on the one hand, is particular within the\ncurriculum, by engaging in cultural politics, and, on the other\nhand, adds to a broader political component, namely education\nfor democratic citizenship. (2002: 154\u2013155)\nThe critical model she proposes integrates three\n\u2018components\u2019 which are all politically based. Firstly,\nshe argues for human rights education and education\nfor democratic citizenship to promote critical cultural\nawareness in teaching a foreign language and culture.\nThe second constituent is an interdisciplinary one\nwhich consists of cultural studies, intercultural\ncommunication and critical pedagogy. She suggests,\nhowever, that the integration of the three, particularly\ncritical pedagogy, in foreign language\/culture edu-\ncation, though important and attempted in some\nstudies, requires further research. The third compo-\nnent comprises a series of \u2018operations\u2019, pedagogical\nstrategies that function at various levels in terms of\nlocal, national and global geopolitics and in relation\nto \u2018existential\u2019 references, namely attitudes, values and\nbeliefs. These operations include cognitive notions\nsuch as analysing and evaluating, affective notions\nsuch as appreciating and pragmatic notions such as\nexperiencing and acting.\nAs an initial step towards a critical perspective\nin language and culture teaching, a number of\nmonographs have appeared recently which provide\ntheoretical underpinnings and practical ideas for\nforeign language teacher training. A common\nfeature of these writings is their attempts to deal\nexplicitly and critically with the social, political\nand ideological aspects in language and language\nlearning and teaching. Nieto (1999, 2002) addresses\nissues of cultural diversity and identity in relation\nto language education in American classrooms\nand advocates community and classroom activities\nin settings ranging from multicultural classrooms\nto district or national levels. In carrying out\nthese activities, in-service and pre-service language\neducators are encouraged to reflect on their practice\nand perceptions of language teaching and learning,\nconduct ethnographic field work and \u2018experience\u2019\nthe critical perspective through activities such as\ncurriculum design. Reagan & Osborn (2002) link\nforeign language education with critical pedagogy\nand propose what they call the \u2018metalinguistic\ncontent\u2019 for foreign language education, moving\nbeyond pragmatic pedagogical concerns to the social\nand political domains relevant to language teaching.\nThe purpose for some of these writers is not only\nto make learners take new perspectives and reflect\non their own, but to focus on some principled and\nuniversal meanings, in order to avoid the relativism of\npost-modernism. Corbett sees this as \u2018neo-humanist\u2019,\nplacing respect for individuals at the heart of the\nenterprise:\nThe intercultural learner moves amongst cultures, in a process\nof continual negotiation, learning to cope with the inevitable\nchanges, in a manner that is ultimately empowering and\nenriching. The home culture is never denied nor demeaned,\nyet the intercultural learner will find his or her attitudes and\nbeliefs challenged by contact with others, and the process of\ninteraction will lead to the kind of personal growth characterised\nby \u2018progressive\u2019 curricula. The social (or \u2018reconstructionist\u2019)\noutcome will be a generation of learners who are trained (to\ndifferent degrees) in \u2018intercultural diplomacy\u2019 \u2013 who will conse-\nquently have learnt to cope with the stresses of living in the multi-\ncultural global village that the world has become. (2003: 211)\n3.3.2 Culture taught as a dialogic process\nAn important feature of a critical perspective in\nlanguage education is the dialogic approach which\n159\nCulture and language learning \u25a0\nemphasises a teacher-student relationship: mutual\nrespect, freedom of expression and dialogic sharing.\nA dialogic approach to language and culture teaching\nmoves away from the traditional concept of teaching\nknowledge as an \u2018I\/It\u2019 phenomenon (I teach it, you\nlearn it) to a teaching method that problematises\nthe very concepts under study (Tomic, 2000). These\ninclude the concepts of \u2018culture\u2019 itself, \u2018cultural\nidentity\u2019, \u2018carriers of culture\u2019 and \u2018non-verbal com-\nmunication\u2019 (Hoffman, 1999; Woodward, 1997;\nScollon & Scollon, 1995). Tomic argues that in\nculture teaching and learning it is the individual\u2019s\nvoice that has more resonance than the \u2018culture\u2019.\nLanguage learners undergo the empowering process\nas they realise that each person\u2019s voice counts.\nBased on the view that language and culture learn-\ning is a dialogic process of interaction with others,\nMorgan & Cain (2000) conducted a project that\naimed to enable secondary students in two schools\nof two countries (England and France) to learn about\neach other\u2019s culture and their own and learn how to\ndecentre and take the other\u2019s perspective. Morgan &\nCain make detailed analysis of the materials the\nstudents themselves produced and of the students\u2019\nreactions to the project and demonstrate how the\nproject helped students engage in the dialogic process.\nIn addition, they state that such a project could\nbenefit not only the students through constant\nintra-textual, inter-textual and illuminative dialogues\nthroughout the process, but also teachers and\nresearchers because it provided them with numerous\nopportunities to interact with students, to understand\nthem in different ways, and with access to a wealth\nof cultural data produced by students themselves.\nThe articles in Fenner (2001) also represent a\ndialogic perspective in dealing with culture in a\nclassroom context. Based on theories exploring\nthe interrelationship between text and reader and\nreading and writing processes as dynamic dialogues,\nthe authors examine the interactions between the\nlearners themselves, the cultures involved, learners\nand teachers, and texts and readers. Common to all\nthe articles is the fact that the practices they present\nare based on classroom activities using authentic texts\nranging from literary texts, to drama, to internet\nmaterials. Interestingly, the activities the language\neducators organised in their classrooms are also\nclaimed to be \u2018authentic\u2019, in the sense the texts\nunder study are \u2018non-finite and open to learner\u2019s\ninterpretations\u2019 (ibid.: 7). Fenner further states that\nthis type of \u2018authentic\u2019 task \u2018gave the learners scope\nfor personal reflection and opinion forming, and\nclassroom work thus became part of their personal\nsociocultural development\u2019. (ibid.). This argument\ncoincides with Feng & Byram\u2019s (2002) notion of\nintercultural authenticity.\nThe dialogic nature of intercultural authenticity is\nclear. It is true that many of the texts or discourses\ntraditionally defined as authentic texts are produced\nby native speakers for the consumption of other\nnative speakers of that language. It is thus not\ndifficult to find in the literature that some argue\nagainst using authentic texts in a language classroom\non the ground that it is almost impossible for the\nclassroom to provide the contextual conditions for\nthe authentic language data to be authenticated by\nlearners. However, intercultural authenticity regards\nthe issue of inauthentic context not as an obstacle\nbut as an opportunity to explore the language and\nculture, including the context, from all angles through\ndialogues. First, it can encourage students\u2019 voices, not\nsilence them, by asking what their initial response\nto and interpretation of the discourse is. Second, it\ncan lead to discussions of the context, the possible\nintended audience and the intended meaning. And\nthird, it may enable both the students and the\nteacher to gain a multifaceted perspective through\nnegotiations and mediation.\n3.3.3 Culture taught as knowledge\nsubject to scrutiny\nThe most conventional and also the most criticised\ndimension of culture teaching is what critics call the\nfacts-oriented approach in which culture is basically\nviewed as civilisation, the \u2018big C\u2019 culture, as well as\neveryday lives, the \u2018small c\u2019 culture (Oswalt, 1970;\nBrooks, 1975; Chastain, 1976). In this facts-oriented\napproach, culture is normally dissected into small seg-\nments which are listed as topics for teaching. Many\ncritics take this approach as inappropriate or even\ndamaging, arguing that it ignores the fact that the\nmajor component of what we call the culture \u2018is\na social construct, a product of self and other\nperceptions\u2019 (Kramsch, 1993: 205). It may well lead\nto the teaching of stereotypes. This criticism is widely\naccepted as few scholars in cultural studies teaching\nand intercultural communication nowadays make\nattempts to list cultural areas or cultural inventories\nfor cultural studies or language teaching programmes.\nNonetheless, the facts-oriented perspective in\nteaching culture is not entirely abandoned, partic-\nularly in language teaching situations where learners\nhave limited opportunities to be exposed to otherness\nand relatively fewer resources to explore the target\nculture. In effect, many language educators in these\ncontexts have been making constant efforts to address\nthe theoretical concerns of this approach to develop\nit into a \u2018critical model\u2019. Hu & Gao (1997), for\nexample, argue that the majority of millions of\nforeign language learners in China are too ignorant\nof the basic formulaic facts of the culture they are\nstudying. The knowledge of the facts is undoubt-\nedly necessary as a starting point for culture\nlearning. They warn of the risks and negative impli-\ncations in teaching stereotypical knowledge as they\npoint out that facts only will inevitably lead to\nsuperficial learning and may enhance stereotypes\n160\n\u25a0 Culture and language learning\nand ethnocentrism. To deal with this paradox, they\npropose an approach where first learners are taught\nstereotypical knowledge (to build an open \u2018bridge\u2019 in\ntheir figurative terms). Immediately, this knowledge\nis put under scrutiny, by providing learners with\na variety of representations of the cultural prod-\nuct or concept under discussion. This is to make\nlearners aware that there are hidden \u2018barriers\u2019 along\nthe seemingly straight, easy-to-cross \u2018bridge\u2019. The\nrepetition of the process will effectively make learners\nculturally sophisticated and eventually obtain the\n\u2018key\u2019 to becoming intercultural speakers. In the last\ndecade or so, the numerous source materials used\nfor culture teaching in China (Hu, 1995; Wang,\n1993a, 1993b; Zhu, 1994, 1991; Deng & Liu,\n1989) apparently point towards this knowledge-\nfor-scrutiny approach. This knowledge-for-scrutiny\napproach is theoretically backed up by Cortazzi &\nJin (1996a, 1996b, 2001) and Jin & Cortazzi (1993,\n1998) whose research consistently shows evidence of\na strong knowledge emphasis in Chinese culture of\nlearning and suggests a synergy model to bridge the\ngaps.\nIn a similar line of thought, Doye\u00b4 (1999) puts\nforward a \u2018strategy for cultural-studies\u2019 for foreign\nlanguage classrooms that starts with stereotypical\ninformation. The twelve-step procedure, in sum-\nmary, engages learners in exploring pre-knowledge,\ncreating cognitive dissonance, replacing stereotypi-\ncal images, exploiting related sources of informa-\ntion and non-verbal communication, comparing\nothers with own and moving beyond the culture of\nthe target language. This process not only enriches\nlearners\u2019 knowledge by studying the culture from dif-\nferent angles, but also improves their skills in com-\nparing and discovering by exploring related sources,\nand enables them to become open-minded and cri-\ntical, by reflecting on their \u2018natural\u2019 way of looking\nat others\u2019 cultures and perhaps their own. Doye\u00b4 calls\nthe knowledge, skills, and attitudes thus obtained the\nkey domains (cognitive, pragmatic and attitudinal)\nof foreign language teaching for intercultural com-\nmunication. He argues that the exploitation of\nthe potential of existing strategies and concepts\nsuch as cultural studies and world studies strategies\nand intercultural communication may lead to a\nmodel that is required to teach English as a global\nlanguage.\n3.4 Culture teaching and culture training\nThe work reviewed so far has general educational\npurposes as well as the intention of developing\nlearners\u2019 practical competences. We have seen that\nHymes stressed the democratic character of ethno-\ngraphy, and we have seen the relationship of culture\nteaching to critical pedagogy with its democratic\nprinciples and focus on critical analysis. The location\nfor this work is above all the foreign or second\nlanguage classroom in schools or universities, and this\nhas two important implications.\nThe first of these is that language and culture are\nseen as inseparable in the learning process; students\nlearn a language and its cultural implications, even\nwhere they are learning it as a lingua franca. They\nlearn to communicate in a new language and this in\nitself is part of the experience of decentring which\ngives them a fresh perspective, a critical perspective,\non the taken-for-granted world which surrounds\nthem. Their competence is both intercultural and\ncommunicative (Byram, 1997a).\nThe second implication is that teachers of lan-\nguages who might have previously seen themselves\nas developing in their learners skills and knowl-\nedge, perhaps with a hope that this would lead to\nattitude change, now find themselves engaged with\nvalues. The perspectives here are based on demo-\ncratic values, on challenging power relations and\ntraditions. Teachers have to handle questions of\nmoral relativity as learners compare and contrast the\nvalues and traditions of their own and other socie-\nties. The focus on communication skills is not lost\nbut in principle it is not possible to ignore the\nsignificance of the implicit process of challenge and\nquestioning.\nIn practice, the significance of this democratic,\neducational dimension can be watered down, as\nteachers prepare their learners for examinations\nwhich do not, and perhaps should not, attempt to\nassess the effect of values and moral education on\nlearners. One of the effects of contemporary emphasis\non \u2018quality and standards\u2019 in most education systems\nis to reinforce \u2018teaching to the test\u2019.\nIt is also important to bear in mind this difference\nbetween principle and practice as we turn to the\nthird approach to teaching: work which trains people\nfor sojourns in other countries. Here, in principle,\nthe emphasis is on skills and knowledge for practical\npurposes, but the educational effects in practice can\nalso include the decentring and challenge which\nleads to re-assessment of the taken-for-granted world.\nOn the other hand, the distinction between training\nfor intercultural competence without a focus on\nlanguage learning, and the combination of language\nand culture learning in general education is usually\nclear. Culture teaching in a training perspective\nfocuses exclusively on the specific information of the\ncountry where the sojourner is going for a short or\nlong stay and offers specific communication patterns,\nthe do\u2019s and don\u2019ts, for living and working in that\ncontext. The approach does not usually take the\nlanguage level of the sojourner into account and is\nused particularly for short training programmes for\npersonnel going abroad for business and studying\npurposes. Numerous texts with titles such as \u2018Living\nin Japan\u2019, \u2018Communicating with Arabs\u2019, \u2018Studying in\nthe U.S.A.\u2019, etc. are written as resource books for\nculture specific study.\n161\nCulture and language learning \u25a0\nThe theoretical basis for this work is largely\npsychological. Bennett\u2019s model for the development\nof intercultural sensitivity (1993) is often cited, and\nWard, Bochner & Furnham (2001) offer a recent\nreview and analysis of psychological theory in this\nfield. An alternative approach is to focus on the\nlinguistic foundation for intercultural relationships.\nTrainers in this approach try to ensure that, ir-\nrespective of whose language is being used, learners\nbecome aware of the significance of speech acts,\nturn-taking, register directness\/indirectness and so\non (Mu\u00a8ller-Jacquier, 2000). Often the assumption\nis that learners will not have time to acquire a\nnew language, will use a lingua franca, usually\nEnglish, and therefore need to understand these\nother features to become sensitive to the nature of\nthe communication. Here the underlying theoretical\nbasis is a comparative linguistic analysis of discourse,\nmost significantly represented in the work of\nScollon & Scollon (1995), and presented in its\npractical implications in Pan, Scollon & Scollon\n(2002).\nThe analysis of work on cross-cultural training\nwould need an article in itself, and insofar as this work\ndoes not focus on language teaching and learning,\nwould be beyond the scope of this journal. There\nare many handbooks and manuals (e.g., Fowler &\nMumfort, 1995, 1999; Cushner & Brislin, 1997;\nKohls & Knight, 1994). Many of these have been\nproduced in the USA where the notion of cross-\ncultural training has been strong, but in the last\ndecade there has been an increasing interest in\nEurope too. The work of Hofstede (1991) and\nTrompenaars (1993) is widely cited, and there are\npractical handbooks and guides increasingly available\n(e.g., Gibson, 2000; Hofstede, Peterson & Hofstede,\n2002). There are also many materials which remain\ncopyright and not widely available for commercial\nreasons. The main thrust of all this work has been\nto prepare people to go to other countries, but it\nalso has relevance in giving those who are immigrant\nto a country an introduction and a programme of\ntransition. This applies particularly to professionals\nentering a workforce, and in Britain for example\nthere has been a very recent development of materials\nfor health professionals from other countries seeking\nwork in Britain.\nWhat is evident and carefully documented in\nDahlen\u2019s (1997) critique of the way these intercul-\nturalists \u2018package\u2019 knowledge of culture, is that there\nis a close relationship with the business world and\nwith the marketplace. Dahlen argues that this leads\nto an approach to culture which is a commodification\nof a dated concept of culture, concluding with some\nirony:\nCould there, despite everything, be ways to open the intercul-\nturalist enterprise to the views of culture which are now more\ncurrent in anthropology? Perhaps, but hardly without some long\nand serious conversations between anthropologists and the inter-\nculturalists. (p. 179)\nMore generally, there is a need for conversations\nbetween interculturalists and academics for mutual\nbenefit. One noteworthy attempt to do this, and\nthen to present the findings for a general public is\nGeoffroy\u2019s (2001) study of the processes of intercul-\ntural communication in an Anglo-French company,\nwhich inter alia demonstrates that language learning\ncannot be ignored even where those involved\nperceive the issues as rooted in the psychology of\nthe individual or the nation. This kind of study is still\nrare however and it is strange that there has been little\ncross-fertilisation among those who prepare students\nfor study abroad \u2013 with their focus on ethnography \u2013\nand those who prepare business people for working\nabroad \u2013 with their focus on psychology. Perhaps one\nbridge is offered by recent work which explores the\nimplications for language learning of a sociocultural\ntheory of mind (Lantolf, 2000b). Here the perspective\ntaken is that learning is mediated by interaction with\nother people in a given sociocultural context, and\nthat we can better understand the learning of other\nlanguages by analysing how that interaction takes\nplace. The significance for culture teaching and train-\ning is yet to be determined, but it suggests that\nresearch is needed to analyse the ways in which people\nlearn other cultures and learn about other cultures in\ninteraction with people who embody them. It is to\nthe research agenda in general, that we turn next.\n4. Taking a position and identifying\nresearch needs\nOne of the purposes of a review article is to evaluate,\nand not only present, research and scholarship.Where\nthere is no disagreement about the purposes of re-\nsearch, then the task is to clarify criteria for good\ntheories and make judgements about which research\nbest meets those criteria.\nEvaluation of intervention and development work\nis less simple because there often remain implicit\npurposes, because the accounts of what is done are\nnot always sufficiently detailed, and because experi-\nmental conditions are not rigorous. Here, teachers\nread teachers\u2019 accounts and rely on their professional\nintuition and judgement. This is not without value\nsince internalised professional criteria are not arbi-\ntrary; they reflect current theories as transmitted in\nteacher education. At the same time, of course, they\nremain often unarticulated and therefore not open to\nreview and revision.\nEvaluation of scholarship which is focused on\n\u2018what ought to be\u2019 and argues for a particular posi-\ntion \u2013 such as those mentioned earlier associated with\nKramsch, Kramer, Starkey and Zarate \u2013 is a more\ncomplex issue. There are no simple criteria beyond\nthose of logical, clear and well-supported argument.\nBehind these, there is often a philosophical position,\n162\n\u25a0 Culture and language learning\nan ideology of human interaction, beliefs about the\nnature of human beings and the societies they form.\nDiscussion of aims and purposes of culture and\nlanguage teaching and learning at this level is quickly\nseen to be related to judgements of values and\ndesirable education.\nIn her discussion of the ways in which language\nteaching should change in universities in the USA, as\na consequence of \u2018major upheavals that are shaking\nat the foundation of the old idea of the university\u2019,\nKramsch argues that \u2018relevance\u2019 is a crucial issue, that\nthere is:\nRenewed pressure on universities to serve national political and\neconomic interests of the time by justifying their choice of the\nknowledge they produce and transmit, and by demonstrating its\nrelevance to the current needs of society. Foreign languages are\nparticularly vulnerable to this pressure. (1995: XVI)\nShe argues that language should be taught as social\npractice and that we should teach \u2018meanings that\nare relevant both to the native speakers and to our\nstudents\u2019. If these were representative views then\nlanguage and culture study would be, first, a means to\nother ends and, second, an acquisition of knowledge\nof relevant meanings. Kramsch goes on, however,\nto say that learners can be made to reflect on their\nown social upbringing and cultural values as a con-\nsequence of study. The overlap between scholarship,\nand a specific view of \u2018what ought to be\u2019, and teach-\ning which reflects a purpose, thus becomes evident\nand takes us back to our earlier discussion of criti-\ncal approaches to teaching. These perspectives may\nappear to be self-evidently desirable, and yet the\nemphasis on the individual might be considered\n\u2018Western\u2019 or European and not take sufficient note\nof Asian concepts of the individual and society (Lee,\n2001; Parmenter, 2003).\nIt is clear, therefore, that where culture teaching-\nand-learning takes place in an educational context,\nquestions of values and ideology are inevitable. Once\nthis is accepted, there are implications for the evalu-\nation of research and scholarship, which go beyond\ntechnical discussions of best theories. This means\nthat, if the position outlined above \u2013 let us call it\nlanguage and political education \u2013 is accepted, then\nresearch and scholarship on culture teaching and\nlearning can be judged not only in terms of its rigour\nand clarity, but also in terms of the contribution it\nmakes to understanding current practice and devel-\noping new, \u2018neo-humanist\u2019 practices, whilst bearing\nin mind the issues of cultural relativity. This means\nthere should be research which investigates the\nrelationship between teaching styles, materials, and\nmethods, and the ability to take new perspectives, to\nbe critical, to understand and act according to the\nprinciples of democratic citizenship.\nAn alternative to this ideology-driven approach\nto evaluation and setting a research agenda, is to\nidentify gaps. When research on culture learning is\ncompared with that on language learning, the most\nobvious gap is the lack of work on \u2018acquisition\u2019. Sercu\n(forthcoming) points out that empirical research\non the acquisition of intercultural competence \u2018is\nstill very limited, and at any rate far more limited\nthan that of studies investigating second language\nacquisition\u2019, and in fact she is obliged to analyse\nwork which focuses mainly on language acquisition\nin her survey. She nonetheless presents a discussion\nof the variables which would have to be taken into\nconsideration in acquisition studies: teacher variables,\nlearner variables, teaching materials, assessment pro-\ncesses. This approach assumes however that culture\nacquisition can be treated in the same way as language\nacquisition. It may not be quite so simple, not least\nbecause of the difficulty of delineating the \u2018object\u2019 to\nbe acquired, which is much easier with language.\nAn alternative perspective which might be exten-\nded to culture learning is suggested by the distinction\nmade by Sfard (1998) between the acquisition meta-\nphor and the participation metaphor. Pavlenko &\nLantolf (2000) apply this to language learning.\nThe acquisition metaphor presents learning as the\nability to internalise knowledge as an object, as a\ncommodity. Language learning is conceptualised as\nthe internalisation of rules and specific linguistic\nentities. The participation metaphor makes us think\nof learning as \u2018a process of becoming a member of a\ncertain community\u2019 (Sfard, 1998: 6). Sfard goes on\nto describe learning of any kind as:\nThe ability to communicate in the language of this community\nand act according to its particular norms. The norms themselves\nare to be negotiated in the process of consolidating the commu-\nnity. While the learners are newcomers and potential reformers\nof the practice, the teachers are the preservers of its continuity.\nThe underlying image is that of socialisation\n(Berger & Luckmann, 1966) which involves both\nparticipation in the community and the internal-\nisation of its beliefs, values and behaviours, its cul-\nture. Sfard\u2019s other suggestion that only newcomers\nreform, that teachers are preservers of tradition, is\nhowever contentious. Teaching within some edu-\ncational traditions is focused precisely on critical\nanalysis of the norms and this is crucial to culture\nteaching too, as we have shown above.\nNonetheless, the use of this metaphor of partici-\npation (combined with acquisition as Sfard says) is\nparticularly apposite for culture teaching provided\nthat the critical dimension of teaching is not for-\ngotten. Culture learning can thus be conceptualised\nas socialisation, by the teacher as mediator, into\nanother culture. The teacher acts as mediator between\nlearners and those who are already members of\nthe language-and-culture group of which they seek\nunderstanding. At the same time, if it is axiomatic\nfor the teacher that learners should reflect critically\nand analytically on their own culture, the partici-\npation and socialisation process will not be focused\n163\nCulture and language learning \u25a0\nexclusively on other cultures. For it is not the purpose\nof teaching, we would contend, to change learners\ninto members of another culture, but to make them\npart of the group who see themselves as mediators,\nable to compare, juxtapose and analyse (Byram,\n1997b).\nFrom this perspective, learners become members\nof a community whose discourse marks them out as\nable to reflect, analyse and compare. The process of\nresearching this would therefore be focused on how\nteachers and learners interact, how their discourse\nreveals their shared position as mediators, how their\nlanguage reveals the acquisition of new concepts and\nrules whilst simultaneously revealing their ability to\ndecentre from their own and others\u2019 concepts to\nbetter understand both.\nThis may also offer an avenue to explore the assess-\nment of culture learning, which is another major gap\nin the research. Research in language testing has made\nsubstantial progress in describing precise levels of\nattainment. However there is no comparable de-\nscription of levels of culture learning, or of inter-\ncultural competence, even though there are a number\nof conceptual frameworks which define intercultural\ncompetence and the behaviour which would be indi-\ncative of it (Byram 1997a; Mendenhall et al., 2000).\n5. Conclusion\nOur review has shown that activity in teaching and\nresearching the cultural dimension and intercultural\ncompetence in language teaching has developed\nrapidly in the last decades. We have also argued\nthat this work cannot avoid engagement with and\nchallenges to values and ideas, and that this is, if not a\nnew direction for language teachers and researchers,\na new emphasis. It reminds us that language teaching\nhas always been susceptible to political and social\ninfluences, whether it was the use of English teaching\nin Germany in the 1920s to boost the self-esteem of\nGerman pupils (Neuner, 1988: 36), or the use of\nEnglish teaching in former colonial countries to re-\nassert Western hegemony (Phillipson, 1992;\nPennycook, 1994, 1998; Widdowson, 2003). It sug-\ngests however that the contribution might also be\npositive \u2212 the development of critical awareness, the\npursuit of democratic processes and values \u2013 whilst\nreminding us that even these need to be challenged.\nThe increase in the volume of work does not\ninevitably mean an improvement in quality, and there\nis a need to develop more systematically a programme\nof research rather than ad hoc efforts which may not\nhave a lasting effect. This is the task for the research\nand teaching community.\nReferences\nAgar, M. (1991). The biculture in bilingual. Language in\nSociety 20, 167\u201381.\nAger, D. E. (2001).
