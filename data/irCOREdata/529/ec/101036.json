INTRODUCTION\nAlthough a variety of different shapes may be found in\nnuclei, it is difficult to probe deviations from axial symmetry.\nThe Lu (Z = 71) isotopes around A \u2248 165 show evidence\nof superdeformed triaxial bands [1\u20134] at high spins, but\nwhether these nuclei also have a stable triaxial shape at\nnormal deformation remains an open question. Analysis of\nsignature splitting suggests that this is in fact the case for the\nyrast 9\/2\u2212[514] band [5,6]. However, signature splitting also\noccurs in axially symmetric deformed nuclei, due to K mixing.\nA complementary test for axial asymmetry is to measure\nthe quadrupole moment of the band [7,8]. The quadrupole\nmoments depend on the \u03b2 as well as the \u03b3 deformation;\ntherefore the experimental values must be compared with cal-\nculations. To investigate the triaxiality further, an experiment\naimed at determining the lifetimes of excited states of 165Lu\nhas been performed. Lutetium-165 represents a good testing\nground because of its close-to-yrast bands based on different\nproton configurations, with possible different shape-driving\neffects.\n\u2217Corresponding author: K.Andgren@surrey.ac.uk.\nII. EXPERIMENT\nThe reaction used to populate the nucleus of interest was\n139La(30Si, 4n)165Lu at a beam energy of 135 MeV (in the\nmiddle of the target). The beam was delivered by the XTU-\ntandem accelerator of Laboratori Nazionali di Legnaro, Italy.\nThe target material consisted of 1.04 mg\/cm2 139La, which\nwas evaporated on a 1.4 mg\/cm2 Ta support. It also had a thin\ngold layer on the other side to prevent oxidation. The target\nwas mounted with the Ta support facing the beam inside the\nplunger apparatus designed by the University of Cologne [9];\nthe apparatus was designed specifically for coincidence recoil\ndistance measurements. A thick 6.4 mg\/cm2 Au foil was used\nas a stopper for the recoiling nuclei after flight in vacuum. The\nplunger apparatus was mounted in the center of the GASP array\n[10] in configuration I. In this configuration GASP consists\nof 40 Compton-suppressed, high-purity Ge \u03b3 -ray detectors,\nwith a total photopeak efficiency of 3% at 1.3 MeV, and 80\nbismuth germanate (BGO) detectors. The 40 Ge detectors are\narranged at seven different angles relative to the beam line\n(6 at 34\u25e6, 6 at 60\u25e6, 4 at 72\u25e6, 8 at 90\u25e6, 4 at 108\u25e6, 6 at 120\u25e6,\nand 6 at 146\u25e6). Events with at least two Ge detectors firing in\ncoincidence were written to tape. The \u03b3 -ray coincidence data\nwere taken at 19 different target-stopper distances between 2\nand 7200 \u00b5m. The plunger is equipped with a feedback system\nto correct for thermal shifts of the target-to-stopper separations.\nThis system uses the capacitance between target and stopper\n0556-2813\/2005\/71(1)\/014312(7)\/$23.00 014312-1 \u00a92005 The American Physical Society\nK.

A schematic level scheme showing the meaning of direct\nB and indirect C feeding transitions, as well as the transition following\nthe decay A.\nfoils to generate a feedback signal which is supplied to a\npiezocrystal.\nIII. DATA ANALYSIS\nA total of 2.5 \u00d7 109 events were recorded. For each target-\nstopper distance and each angular combination, the data were\nsorted into \u03b3 \u03b3 -coincidence matrices. This means that a total\nof 19 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 7 = 931 matrices were created. The lifetimes\nwere determined using the differential decay curve method\n(DDCM) [11,12]. A correct application of the DDCM requires\n\u03b3 -ray intensities at different distances. Therefore, all of the\nmatrices were normalized with respect to the total number of\ncounts in each matrix. It was checked that this was proportional\nto the intensities of some of the strongest peaks in 165Lu.\nThis was done by examining the peak intensities relative to\nthe total number of counts in the matrix for one ring-ring\ncombination (90\u25e6-90\u25e6) at all of the 19 distances and for all\nof the ring-ring combinations at one distance (23 \u00b5m). The\nvelocity of the recoiling nuclei was obtained by measuring the\nshifted energies of some of the strongest transitions in 165Lu\nat the different angles. The measurements gave a value for the\nvelocity of v = 1.54(3)% of the speed of light.\nThe DDCM avoided the lifetime uncertainties related to\nunobserved side feeding and delayed feeding. A gate was set\non the shifted component of the feeding transition and the\nintensities of the shifted and unshifted peaks of the \u03b3 ray\nfollowing the decay (see Fig. 1) were analyzed at the different\ndistances giving mean lives,\n\u03c4 = I\nBA\nu\nv\ndIBAs\ndx\n, (1)\nwhere Iu is the intensity of the unshifted peak, Is is the intensity\nof the shifted peak (both the intensities are taken from spectra\nwhen a gate is set on the shifted component of the feeding\ntransition), v is the velocity, and x is the target-stopper distance.\nThe capital-letter indices in the expression, which specify the\nintensities, are defined in Fig. 1. In some cases, when the direct\nfeeding transition could not be used because of contamination,\na gate was set on the shifted component of an indirect feeder.\nThe formula then changed to\n\u03c4 = I\nCA\nu \u2212 \u03b1ICBu\nv\ndICAs\ndx\n, (2)\nwhere \u03b1 is the ratio\n\u03b1 = I\nCA\nu + ICAs\nICBu + ICBs\n. (3)\nFor each ring of detectors, a gate was set on one of the\naxes in the 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 19 coincidence matrices. (The detectors at\n90\u25e6 could not be used because the energies were not Doppler\nshifted at that angle.) Figure 2 presents examples of \u03b3 -ray\ncoincidence spectra.\nTo increase the statistics, the cuts were then summed up,\nfor each of the six rings, on the second axis. The weighted\naverage of the lifetime was derived by fitting a straight line\nthrough the points of the \u03c4 (x) curve calculated using Eq. (1).\nOnly the relevant points in the region of sensitivity, where\nthe intensity curves were steep, were taken into account; see\nFig. 3. The lifetimes were checked for each angle to\nensure that the spectra contained no contamination.

Lifetime determination of the I\u03c0 = 17\/2+ level of the 7\/2+[404] band (left) and the I\u03c0 = 17\/2\u2212 level of the 1\/2\u2212[541] band\n(right). The \u03b3 \u03b3 matrices were gated on the shifted components of the feeding transitions 538 and 433 keV, respectively. The intensities of the\nunshifted and shifted peaks of the decaying 475 and 335 keV transitions are shown in the middle panels. The derivative of the shifted peak\nis shown in the bottom panels. From this information, the lifetime was extracted and the result is shown in the upper panels. The dotted lines\nshow the region of sensitivity where the lifetimes were determined.\nthe spectra were free from contamination, summed into one\nset of spectra (i.e., 19 spectra, one summed spectrum for each\ndistance). Examples of such lifetime determinations are shown\nin Fig. 3.\nIn some of the cuts this could not be done because of\ncontaminating transitions, mainly from transitions in the same\nnucleus. In these cases, only the clean ring-ring combinations\nwere used. Also, if the depopulating \u03b3 energy was too low\n( <\u223c200 keV) clean sum-spectra could not be obtained, since the\nunshifted and shifted peaks were not completely separated. In\nthis case the average value of the lifetimes obtained at different\nangles was considered instead.\nIV. RESULTS\nLifetimes of 19 different states were obtained for four of\nthe rotational bands built upon the 9\/2\u2212[514], 7\/2+[404],\n1\/2\u2212[541], and 1\/2+[411] single-particle configurations. See\nFig. 4 for a partial level scheme of 165Lu. A fifth rotational band\nbuilt on the 5\/2+[402] configuration has also been discovered\nin this nucleus [13], but this band was weakly populated in\nthe present experiment. The measured lifetimes ranged from\n\u223c1 to \u223c200 ps and are given in Table I together with the\nextracted reduced transition probabilities B(E2). Higher up in\nspin, the lifetimes became <\u223c1 ps, which was comparable to the\nslowing down time of the recoil in the stopper, and therefore\nthese lifetimes could not be determined using this method.\nIn general, the lifetimes were determined by gating on the\ndirect feeder, except for the 9\/2\u2212 state of the 1\/2\u2212[541] band\nwhere the gate was set on the indirect feeding transition of\n433 keV, since the direct feeding transition of 228 keV is a\ndoublet (the partner is in the 7\/2+[404] band). It is generally\neasier to extract clean spectra if the gate is set on a higher\nenergy transition, since there are fewer transitions with higher\nenergy and their shifted and unshifted parts are also more\nseparated. The lifetime of the 15\/2+ state in the band built\non the 7\/2+[404] orbital could not be measured because the\n509 keV transition was too close to the electron-positron\nannihilation \u03b3 rays at 511 keV. The same problem resulted\n014312-3\nK. ANDGREN et al.

The experimental Qt (\u03b3 = 0\u25e6) and Qt (\u03b3 ) are marked with filled and unfilled circles. The theoretical Q20 values from the\nTRS calculations are shown as solid lines.

We note that for the bands built on the 9\/2\u2212[514]\nand the 7\/2+[404] configurations, the \u03b42 mixing ratio has been\nextracted from angular correlation measurements [13,15]. The\nestimated \u03b42 lies a factor of 2\u20133 below the measured ones,\nwhich might be a consequence of K mixing and\/or deviation\nfrom axial symmetry. However, the effect on the determined\nquadrupole moments due to the different \u03b42 is smaller (on\nthe order of 1\u20134 \u00d710\u22122 e b) than those caused by other\nuncertainties. From the reduced transition probabilities, the\ntransitional quadrupole moment, under the assumption of an\naxially symmetric deformed shape Qt (\u03b3 = 0\u25e6), was calculated\nusing the relation\nQ2t =\n16\u03c0\n5\nB(E2; I \u2192 I \u2212 2)|\u3008IK20|(I \u2212 2)K\u3009|\u22122. (4)\nThe obtained transitional quadrupole moments are shown\nin Table I and in Fig. 5.\nV. DISCUSSION\nTo get a deeper understanding of the nuclear shape, we\nperformed total Routhian surface (TRS) calculations using the\nnonaxial deformed Woods-Saxon potential [16]. Collective\nrotation was investigated in the frame of the cranked shell\nmodel in the three-dimensional deformation space of \u03b22, \u03b3 ,\nand \u03b24. Both monopole and double-stretched quadrupole\npairings were included [17]. The monopole pairing strength\nG was determined by the average-gap method [18], and\nquadrupole pairing strengths were obtained by restoring the\nGalilean invariance broken by the seniority pairing force [19].\nTo avoid the spurious phase transition encountered in the BCS\napproach, we used approximate particle-number projection by\nmeans of the Lipkin-Nogami method [20]. Pairing correlations\nare dependent on the rotational frequency and deformation. In\norder to include such dependence in the TRS, we performed\npairing-deformation-frequency self-consistent TRS calcula-\ntions; i.e., for any given deformation and frequency, the\npairing gaps were self-consistently calculated by a HFB-like\nmethod [20]. At a given frequency, the deformation of a\nstate was determined by minimizing the calculated TRS. The\ncalculations indicate no significant shape changes below the\n014312-5\nK. ANDGREN et al.

The TRS values for the four bandheads\nwere also calculated, since the particle configuration could be\nfixed at spin zero. The difference between the bandhead\ndeformation and the deformation at the relevant spins is\nbetween 0 and 6% for the three bands where both calculations\nare available.\nThe theoretical intrinsic quadrupole moment was extracted\nas Q = \u2211 2V 2k qk , where qk are the single-proton quadrupole\nmoments obtained from the Wood-Saxon wave functions and\nV 2k are the pairing occupation probabilities of the k:th orbital.\nThe quadrupole moment has contributions from two spherical-\ntensor components, Q = Q20 + Q22. The Q20 term depends\non the \u03b22 quadrupole deformation and it is independent of\nthe degree of triaxiality. The Q22 term vanishes for axially\nsymmetric nuclei, being negative for positive \u03b3 , and positive\nfor negative \u03b3 deformations. In our case where the predicted\n\u03b3 \u2248 0\u25e6 for all the single-particle bands, only the Q20 term is\nconsidered.\nThe band based on the 9\/2\u2212[514] configuration is the yrast\nband. The TRS calculations predict the energy minima at\n\u03b22 = 0.229, \u03b24 = 0.014, \u03b3 = \u22123.1\u25e6, with a \u03b3 softness for the\nnegative signature. For positive signature, the lowest config-\nuration in the TRS corresponds to the 1\/2\u2212[541] orbital and\nhence we are not able to calculate the TRS for the 9\/2\u2212[514]\nconfiguration. An increasing amount of signature splitting is\nobserved in this band. This might be explained by the \u03b3\nsoftness predicted by the TRS calculations for the negative\nsignature, but the result is inconclusive. Also, the quasiproton\nRouthians show a signature splitting of this band at low spins\nwhen triaxiality is assumed. The experimental values might\nindicate higher quadrupole moments for the negative signature,\nwhich supports a triaxial deformation, with negative \u03b3 values.\nThere might also be a slight trend of decreasing quadrupole\nmoments with increasing angular momenta. The experimen-\ntal average (of the five points, two for the positive and\nthree for the negative signature, respectively) quadrupole\nmoment is 6.70(16) e b. The average Qt for the negative\nsignature only, of 6.92(19) e b, is different from the theoretical\none of 6.06 e b. See Fig. 5(a) for a plot of the theoretical and\nexperimentally obtained quadrupole moments.\nThis band has also been extensively studied using the\nparticle-rotor model [5,6,21]. In those works, the (signature\nsplitting of the) energy spectrum, the B(M1)\/B(E2) transition\nstrength ratios, and the experimentally available Q(1)\/Q(2)\nratios [where B(E2; \tI = p) = 516\u03c0 \u3008IK20|I \u2212 p,K\u30092Q(p)]\nare fitted. This latter ratio is very sensitive to the \u03b3 defor-\nmation and nearly independent of \u03b2: Q(1)\/Q(2) \u223c cos(30\u25e6\n\u2212\u03b3 )\/cos(30\u25e6 + \u03b3 ). These calculations indicate a significant\ntriaxiality for the odd-Z 161,163,165,167Lu isotopes, with in-\ncreasing \u03b3 deformation as the neutron number decreases. In\nparticular, for the 165Lu nucleus, \u03b3 = \u221219\u25e6 and \u03b3 = \u221215\u25e6\nwere suggested by [5] and [6] respectively. Similar conclusions\nare drawn in Ref. [22] for the case of the tantalum isotopes\n(with \u03b3 = \u221218\u25e6 for 165Ta). In the last columns of Table I\nthe experimentally extracted quadrupole moments assuming\nthe deformation parameter \u03b3 = \u221215\u25e6 are given using the\nformula [23],\nQ2t =\n8\u03c0\n5\nB(E2; I \u2192 I \u2212 2) (2I \u2212 1)(2I + 1)(I \u2212 1)I\n\u00d7\n[\ncos(\u03b3 + 30\u25e6) \u2212 cos(\u03b3 \u2212 30\u25e6) K\n2\n(I \u2212 1)I\n]\u22122\n(5)\nIn the inset of Fig. 5(a), these values are compared with the\ntheoretical ones for 161Lu and 163Lu [6] (no values for 165Lu are\npublished), which suggests Qt \u2248 5.8 and 5.7 e b for negative\nsignature and Qt \u2248 5.2 and 5.5 e b for positive signature for\n161Lu and 163Lu respectively. There is a remarkable agreement\nbetween the particle-rotor model and the experiment.\n014312-6\nLIFETIME MEASUREMENTS OF NORMAL DEFORMED . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW C 71, 014312 (2005)\nIn the case of the 7\/2+[404] band, the two signatures are\npredicted to have similar deformations with \u03b22 = 0.236, \u03b24 =\n0.014, and \u03b3 = \u22122.1\u25e6. The constant nature of the extracted\nquadrupole moments is consistent with this. The average of the\nexperimental quadrupole moments of 6.16(10) e b is slightly\nlower than the theoretical value of 6.33 e b.\nIt is expected that the band based on the 1\/2\u2212[541]\nconfiguration has the highest deformation because of the\nstrong core-polarizing effect of this Nilsson orbital. Jo\u00b4nsson\net al. [13] needed to consider higher deformation compared to\nthe 9\/2\u2212[514], 7\/2+[404], 1\/2+[411] configurations in order\nto reproduce the crossing frequencies (alignment of i13\/2\nneutron pair) in the cranked shell model calculations. This is\nconsistent with the experimental observations in 16569 Tm, where\nit was found that the quadrupole moment of the 1\/2\u2212[541]\nband is 15% higher than that of the 7\/2+[404] and 1\/2+[411]\nbands [24]. Our TRS calculations predict a higher deformation\nfor this band than for the 7\/2+ and 9\/2\u2212 bands, namely, \u03b22 =\n0.273, \u03b24 = 0.029, and \u03b3 = \u22120.8\u25e6. In accordance with this,\nthe experimental average quadrupole moment Qt = 7.39(13)\ne b is higher than in the other three bands.\nIn the case of the 1\/2+[411] band no TRS calculations for\nthe relevant spins could be performed. Instead the bandhead\ndeformation was calculated and the deformation parameters\nwere determined: \u03b22 = 0.232, \u03b24 = 0.016, \u03b3 = 2.2\u25e6, with a\nrather \u03b3 -soft shape. The experimentally obtained quadrupole\nmoments suggest a reduction of deformation with increasing\nangular momentum. The theoretical value of 6.86 e b (cal-\nculated using the \u03b2 values from the TRS) for the I\u03c0 = 1\/2+\nbandhead fits well into this trend.\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\nA fusion-evaporation reaction experiment has been per-\nformed in order to populate medium spin states in 165Lu. A total\nof 19 lifetimes in four rotational bands have been measured for\nthe first time by means of the differential decay curve method.\nThe extracted transition strengths and transition quadrupole\nmoments were compared with theoretical calculations. There\nis general agreement between the experimental data and the\nperformed TRS calculations, which give axially deformed\nshapes for the 9\/2\u2212[514], 7\/2+[404], and 1\/2\u2212[541] bands,\nwith a \u03b3 softness for the 9\/2\u2212[514] configuration. Within this\ntheory the differences in quadrupole moments are explained\nby different axial symmetric shapes, with the 1\/2\u2212[541] band\nbeing the most deformed. It is not clear from the calculations\nwhether the observed signature splitting in the 9\/2\u2212[514] band\ncould be explained by the predicted \u03b3 softness. On the other\nhand, the quadrupole moments obtained for the 9\/2\u2212[514] band\nare in remarkably good agreement with previous particle-rotor\ncalculations [5,6]. These calculations, in contrast to the TRS\ncalculations, are consistent with a considerable amount of\ntriaxiality (\u03b3 = \u221215\u25e6).\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors thank the staff of the tandem accelerator,\nLegnaro, for providing a high-quality beam.
