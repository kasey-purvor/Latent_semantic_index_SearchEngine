The peculiar properties of\nthese objects are typified by the so-called \u2018alignment effect\u2019, i.e.\nthe tendency for their optical and radio axes to be aligned (Mc-\nCarthy et al. 1987; Chambers, Miley & van Breugel 1987). Studies\nof 3C 356 provided one of the first examples of an alignment effect\nseen at near-infrared wavelengths (Eales & Rawlings 1990) and\nthe large (4.8 arcsec) separation of the two primary aligned com-\nponents (denoted \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019 by Eales & Rawlings) made it ideal\nfor ground-based studies. However, the picture is complicated by\nthe fact that both galaxies display radio emission (Fernini et al.\n1993) and consequently 3C 356 remains one of the very few 3C ob-\njects where the site of the powerful jet-producing central engine has\nnot yet been unambiguously identified with a specific host galaxy.\nEales & Rawlings (1990) proposed that the jet-producing engine\nwas housed in component \u2018b\u2019 (brighter in both the radio and opti-\n\u22c6 Email: chris@subaru.naoj.org\ncal), and favoured a model in which component \u2018a\u2019 was a starburst\ntriggered by the advancing radio source. Lacy & Rawlings (1994)\nextended this hypothesis by suggesting that components \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018d\u2019\n(a further aligned component located on the other side of \u2018b\u2019) had\nundergone two episodes of star formation driven by interactions be-\ntween gas clouds and precessing antiparallel jets. These ideas were\nstrongly challenged by the detection of broad emission lines in the\npolarized-light spectrum of 3C 356a (Cimatti et al. 1997), indicat-\ning the presence of a bona fide AGN in this component.\nThe idea that powerful radio galaxies can be used to locate\ndistant clusters of galaxies has its basis in both theory and obser-\nvations. The luminosities of these objects imply the existence of\nextremely massive black holes at their centres, which in turn im-\nplies the host galaxies themselves are massive (e.g. Haenhelt &\nKauffmann 2000; Laor 2001), a result supported by observations\nof radio galaxies at all redshifts. In addition, the red colours of ra-\ndio galaxies and the small scatter in the K-band Hubble diagram\nof their hosts (e.g. Eales & Rawlings 1996; Simpson, Rawlings &\nLacy 1999) imply that their stellar populations are old and conse-\nquently formed at an early epoch and, in models of structure for-\nmation, galaxies form first in the most overdense regions. 3C 356\nwas the first distant radio galaxy to be detected in X-rays (Craw-\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS\n2 C. Simpson and S. Rawlings\nford & Fabian 1993) and when follow-up observations showed this\nemission to be diffuse, it was assumed that the radio source is em-\nbedded in a rich cluster (Crawford & Fabian 1996). Since then,\nother distant 3C objects have been detected (e.g. Worrall et al. 1994;\nCrawford & Fabian 1995), including the z = 1.786 radio galaxy\n3C 294 (Fabian et al. 2001), currently the most distant intraclus-\nter medium detected. Statistical studies reveal an excess of faint\ngalaxies around the z \u223c 1 3C radio galaxies, consistent with a\nrichness of Abell Class 0 (Best 2000), and therefore similar to the\naverage found for slightly lower-redshift objects (e.g. Hill & Lilly\n1991; Wold et al. 2000). Yet despite the moderate number of X-\nray detections and the statistical evidence, only 3C 324 has had\nits location in a rich cluster confirmed (Dickinson 1997), permit-\nting a more detailed study of its environment (e.g. Kajisawa et al.\n2000a,b). Nevertheless, it has been suggested (Bremer, Fabian &\nCrawford 1997) that the cluster environment is important in trig-\ngering and fuelling the radio source beyond merely providing a site\nfor a massive elliptical galaxy capable of hosting a powerful radio\nsource. The interplay between powerful radio sources and their en-\nvironments therefore warrants further investigation, and 3C 356 is\nonce again a suitable test case for such a study.\nIn this paper, we present (Section 2) new deep, wide-field\nnear-infrared images of 3C 356 and new near-infrared spectra of\nboth the principal components. We combine our imaging data with\narchival HST WFPC2 images in Section 3 to investigate the clus-\ntering environment of the radio galaxy. In Section 4, we reconsider\nthe nature of galaxies \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019. In Section 5 we discuss the X-ray\nproperties of 3C 356 and propose a model for the triggering of pow-\nerful radio galaxies, within the framework of which we attempt to\nexplain the properties of other well-studied powerful radio galax-\nies. Finally in Section 6 we provide a brief summary of our conclu-\nsions. Throughout this paper, we adopt H0 = 70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121,\n\u2126m = 0.3, and \u2126\u039b = 0.7. For this cosmology, 1 arcsec represents\na projected distance of 8.1 kpc at the redshift of 3C 356.\n2 OBSERVATIONS AND REDUCTION\n2.1 Deep near-infrared imaging\nDeep near-infrared images at J and K\u2032 of 3C 356 were ob-\ntained with the Cooled Infrared Spectrograph and Camera for OHS\n(CISCO; Motohara et al. 1998), mounted at the Nasmyth focus of\nSubaru Telescope, on the night of UT 2000 June 17. CISCO has\na field of view of \u223c 2 arcmin square. Eight-point jittered mosaics\nwere taken at each of four locations around the radio galaxy, to\ncover a square region slightly over 3 arcmin on a side.\nThe data were dark-subtracted and a flatfield created for each\neight-point mosaic from median-filtered, object-masked images.\nSince the bias level of CISCO does not stabilize immediately after\nthe telescope has nodded to a new position, only the last few images\nat each position were used to construct the flatfield. An attempt was\nmade to correct for the variable bias level in the following manner.\nThe sky level was estimated and an appropriately scaled version of\nthe flatfield subtracted from the image. An estimate of the residual\nsignal in each column was then determined and subtracted from\nthat column, and the final image flatfielded. The success of this\nmethod was determined by fitting a parabola to a log-histogram of\nthe sigma-clipped pixels to estimate the noise in object-free areas\nof the frame, and the procedure repeated iteratively to minimize\nthis noise. This procedure was extremely successful for the J-band\ndata, but failed to produce an acceptable result for the firstK\u2032-band\nimage at each position, and one-eighth of the K\u2032-band images had\nto be discarded. All the images taken in each filter (which had al-\nready been sky-subtracted by the above procedure) were then mo-\nsaicked with bad pixel rejection, using offsets computed from the\ncentroids of the brightest unsaturated objects.\nThe typical exposure times per point were 2560 s at J and\n1120 s at K\u2032, while the central region received the total exposure\ntime which was four times greater. The FWHM of the final images\nwere 0.42 arcsec and 0.55 arcsec in J and K\u2032, respectively. The\nJ-band image was aligned with and then smoothed to the poorer\nresolution of the K\u2032-band image.\nThe near-infrared images were flux calibrated using the\nUKIRT faint standard FS 27 (Hawarden et al. 2001). While FS 27 is\nmuch bluer than a z \u223c 1 galaxy, colour terms for CISCO are neg-\nligible compared to the UKIRT photometric system (F. Iwamuro,\nprivate communication). The systematic uncertainties in the photo-\nmetric calibration are \u00b10.04mag at J and \u00b10.03mag at K\u2032. With\nour photometric calibration, the 3\u03c3 limits in a 2-arcsec aperture\nare J = 23.56 and K\u2032 = 21.67. To ensure a similar detection\nthreshold across the entire image, we consider only that part of the\nimages which received at least the exposure times listed above. The\nK\u2032-band image of this field, measuring 8.436 arcmin2 and centered\napproximately 9 arcsec north of component \u2018a\u2019, is shown in Fig. 1.\nWe also retrieved the Hubble Space Telescope WFPC2 F622W\nand F814W images presented in Best, Longair & Ro\u00a8ttgering (1997)\nfrom the HST Data Archive (PID 1070; P.I. Longair). The images\nwere combined and sky-subtracted using the IRAF\/STSDAS task cr-\nrej. The wmosaic task was used to correct for geometric distortions\nso that a simple transformation between the coordinate frames of\nthe HST and Subaru data could be made. During the longer F622W\nexposure, an object moved across the field of view, leaving a bright\ntrack about 2 arcsec wide. Fortuitously, this track passed through\nthe photometric aperture of only one source, which was not affected\nby cosmic rays in the shorter exposure. We were therefore able to\nobtain a photometric measurement for this source, although the un-\ncertainty is much larger due to the shorter exposure time.\nFor consistency with our near-infrared images, we also cali-\nbrate the HST images on the Vega magnitude scale, as opposed to\nthe AB scale which is more frequently used. The offsets for the\nF622W and F814W filters are 0.08 and 0.36 mag, respectively, in\nthe sense that mAB > mVega. We do not correct for the small\nGalactic extinction (AV = 0.06; Simpson et al. 1999).\n2.2 Near-infrared spectroscopy\nWe obtained near-infrared spectra of components \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019 on\nthe night of UT 1999 May 13 using the CGS4 spectrograph on\nUKIRT. A 0.6-arcsec wide slit was used in conjunction with the\n40 lines mm\u22121 grating in second order to provide a resolution of\n\u223c 360 km s\u22121 at the redshifted wavelength of [O III] \u03bb5007. After\npeaking up on the bright star to the south of component \u2018b\u2019, the\nautoguider crosshead was offset 11.3 arcsec south and 0.3 arcsec\nwest and this star was reacquired and used for guiding during the\nobservation. A position angle of 135\u25e6 ensured that both galaxies \u2018a\u2019\nand \u2018b\u2019 were included within the slit. A total of 112 minutes was\nspent on source, with spectra being taken at two positions along\nthe slit with the usual \u2018ABBA\u2019 technique (e.g. Eales & Rawlings\n1993). Bad pixel masking and interleaving of the 2\u00d72 oversampled\nspectra was performed within CGS4DR and the 2-D spectrum was\nexported to IRAF for further reduction. The flux scale was tied to the\nUKIRT bright standard HD 162208. A spatial cut of the standard\nstar spectra revealed a FWHM of 2 pixels (1.2 arcsec), although\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nThe radio galaxy 3C 356 and clues to the trigger mechanisms for powerful radio sources 3\nFigure 1.

Only those objects above our completeness limit of K \u2032 < 20.8 are indicated.\nthe true seeing would be less than this due to the coarse pixel scale.\nSpectra were extracted along a 3-pixel (1.8-arcsec) aperture.\nThe spectra of components \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019 thus extracted are\nshown in Fig. 2. Both components of the [O III] \u03bb\u03bb4959,5007\ndoublet are clearly detected in component \u2018a\u2019, but no line emis-\nsion is seen in \u2018b\u2019. The flux of the \u03bb5007 line in \u2018a\u2019 is (5.5 \u00b1\n0.3)\u00d7 10\u221218 W m\u22122, and it is resolved spectrally with FWHM \u2248\n900 km s\u22121. Assuming a similar width for the narrow line emission\nin 3C 356b, we can place a 3\u03c3 upper limit of 7.4 \u00d7 10\u221219 W m\u22122\non the strength of this line in our extraction aperture.\nWe note that the [O III] \u03bb5007 line flux we measure for com-\nponent \u2018a\u2019 alone is very similar to that determined by Jackson &\nRawlings (1997) for \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019 combined. However, Jackson &\nRawlings\u2019 spectrum was taken with 3-arcsec pixels, and therefore\nthey had extreme difficulty in separating the line emission from\nthe two components. Our 2-D spectrum clearly shows that all the\n[O III] emission arises in component \u2018a\u2019.\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n4 C. Simpson and S. Rawlings\nFigure 2.

The locations of the ma-\njor emission lines are labelled, based on the observed wavelength of [O III]\nin component \u2018a\u2019 and the redshift difference reported in Lacy & Rawlings\n(1994).\n3 THE ENVIRONMENT OF 3C 356\n3.1 Source detection and incompleteness\nTo investigate the environment of 3C 356, we used SExtractor\nV2.0.21 (Bertin & Arnouts 1996). We ran the object detection algo-\nrithm on the K\u2032-band image, since this filter samples a rest wave-\nlength of \u223c 1\u00b5m, and use \u2018two-image mode\u2019 to obtain photometry\nin the other filters. Photometry was performed in 2-arcsec aper-\ntures centered on the K\u2032 barycentres. We adopted an object detec-\ntion threshold of 10 connected pixels which exceeded the local sky\nlevel by 1\u03c3.\nWe investigated incompleteness in the standard manner of tak-\ning isolated galaxies, reducing their brightnesses, and then adding\nthem back in to the image at random positions. We estimated the\ncompleteness as the fraction of these sources which are recovered\nby the detection algorithm. Our catalogue is 100 per cent com-\nplete down to K\u2032 \u2248 20.8 and drops to zero completeness by\nK\u2032 \u2248 21.6. The appropriate k-correction for a present-day ellipti-\ncal galaxy is\u22120.73; we are therefore complete to\u223c 1.5mag fainter\nthan M\u2217K = \u221224.63 (Gardner et al. 1997) at z \u2248 1. Alternatively,\na present-day 13-Gyr-old L\u2217 galaxy would have K\u2032 \u2248 18.1 at\nz = 1.08, accounting for passive evolution according to the PE-\nGASE models of Fioc & Rocca-Volmerange (1997), and we should\ntherefore be able to detect galaxies as faint as 0.1L\u2217 at the redshift\nof 3C 356.\nSince the fractional completeness is not uniform across our\nimage atK\u2032 > 20.8 due to differences in exposure time, we restrict\nfuture discussion in this paper to those objects which lie above our\ncompleteness limit.\n3.2 Star\u2013galaxy separation\nOf the 135 objects with K\u2032 \u2264 20.8, 74 lie within the WFPC2 field\nof view, and all are readily identifiable in one or both of the HST\nimages. Of these, we classify 30 as stars based on their having a\nFWHM of \u223c 1.5 pixels or being saturated and displaying diffrac-\ntion spikes; the other 44 are all resolved. To classify the remaining\n61 objects not within the WFPC2 field of view, we computed the\ninverse second moment of the 132 unsaturated objects, r\u22122 (Kron\n1980), from the unsmoothed J-band image and plotted this against\nFigure 3.

Known stars and galaxies are clearly\nseparated in this Figure, and we classified the other objects ac-\ncording to their locations. Our complete sample thus consists of\n88 galaxies and 47 stars.\n3.3 The richness of the 3C 356 cluster\nWe note first the small number of galaxies in our field: the number\ncounts of Gardner, Cowie & Wainscoat (1993) predict 130 galax-\nies with K < 20.5 (approximately the same depth as our complete\nsample after accounting for aperture losses). This indicates the need\nto image a moderately wide field to obtain an accurate field cor-\nrection when attempting to detect an excess of galaxies around a\nhigh-redshift object. However, the fraction of red galaxies is large;\nElston, Eisenhardt & Stanford (in preparation) find that only 44 per\ncent of galaxies with K < 20 have J \u2212 K > 1.7 (S. A. Stan-\nford, private communication), whereas we find the fraction is 56\nper cent (assuming K\u2032 \u2212 K = 0.1), inconsistent at the 99 per\ncent level. In addition, a plot of the radial distribution of galaxies\n(Fig. 4a) clearly shows a highly significant excess of objects around\nthe radio galaxy. We choose 3C 356b as the origin for investigating\na radial excess as it has the brightest total K-band magnitude, and\nis therefore presumably the most massive component.\nThe excess of galaxies near 3C 356 is even more significant\nwhen only the reddest galaxies are considered (Fig. 4b). We clas-\nsify as \u2018red\u2019 those galaxies with J \u2212K\u2032 > 1.58; this is the colour\nof a 4.3-Gyr old S0 galaxy at z = 1.08, according to the PEGASE\nmodels, and 4.3 Gyr is the elapsed time since a plausible formation\nredshift of z = 5. While the probability of 9 randomly selected\ngalaxies all having J \u2212 K\u2032 > 1.58 is less than 1 per cent, all 9\ngalaxies within 20 arcsec of 3C 356b are this red. We label the ob-\njects above our completeness limit in Fig. 1 with symbols according\nto their nature.\nWe interpret the excess of galaxies around 3C 356, which is\nvisible in both panels of Fig. 4, as part of a group or cluster around\nthe radio galaxy. We confirm this in Fig. 5, where it is apparent that\nthe galaxies which are red in J \u2212K\u2032 are also red in F622W\u2212K\u2032,\nand so can only be early-type galaxies at z >\n\u223c\n1. (It is also clear that\nour star\u2013galaxy separation has worked well.)\nWe estimate the richness of the cluster using Hill & Lilly\u2019s\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nThe radio galaxy 3C 356 and clues to the trigger mechanisms for powerful radio sources 5\nFigure 4.

This is the excess of galaxies within 0.5 Mpc\n(61 arcsec) of the cluster centre and brighter thanm1+3, wherem1\nis the magnitude of the brightest cluster member. Hill & Lilly dis-\ncuss the advantages of this method over measurements which rely\non the magnitude of the third brightest cluster member, m3 (e.g.\nAbell 1958; Bahcall 1981). Using our aperture magnitudes, com-\nponent \u2018a\u2019 is the brighter of the two main components, and hence\nK\u20321 = 17.87. Although K\u20321 + 3 is therefore slightly fainter than\nour completeness limit, we do not apply a correction as there are\nonly 3 galaxies with 20.80 < K\u2032 < 20.87 and we estimate the\ncompleteness in this range to be > 90 per cent. Although Fig. 4\nclearly shows an excess of (red) objects within \u223c 150 kpc of the\nradio galaxy, this excess is diluted when considering a 0.5-Mpc\nradius circle. Based on the mean number density at projected dis-\ntances greater than 0.5 Mpc, we calculate that N0.5 < 14 (3\u03c3). The\nshapes of the histograms in Fig. 4 suggest that there are unlikely to\nbe many cluster members at radial distances greater than 0.5 Mpc,\nwhich would contaminate our background counts and hence cause\nus to underestimate the cluster richness.\nFigure 5. Colour\u2013colour plot for sources in the field of 3C 356. Filled stars\nrepresent stars, and open circles are galaxies, with the size of the circle\nrelated to the K \u2032 magnitude. The dashed line is the locus of main sequence\nstars from the spectral library of Fioc & Rocca-Volmerange (1997). The\nsolid lines are the loci of 4.3-Gyr old E and S0 galaxies for 0 \u2264 z \u2264 2, also\nfrom Fioc & Rocca-Volmerange. The E locus is the upper of the two, and\ncrosses are placed at redshift intervals of 0.2.\nWe therefore conclude (from table 4 of Hill & Lilly 1991) that\n3C 356 lies in an environment poorer than Abell richness class 0,\nalthough Fig. 4 provides compelling evidence that it is not isolated.\nThis environment is perhaps somewhat poorer than the average of\nmoderate-redshift radio-loud AGN (e.g. Hill & Lilly 1991; Roche\net al. 1999; Best 2000; Wold et al. 2000, 2001), but certainly not un-\nusual given the large spread. However, the environment of 3C 356\nrepresents a much poorer cluster than all 14 of the distant (z \u223c 0.5)\nX-ray selected clusters of McNamara et al. (2001), which have sim-\nilar X-ray luminosities, LX \u223c 1037 W, to that detected by Craw-\nford & Fabian (1993). There seems therefore to be a discrepancy\nbetween the X-ray and optical\/infrared properties of the environ-\nment of 3C 356, which we will address later.\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n6 C.

The images have all been smoothed\nwith a 0.\u2032\u203215 (FWHM) Gaussian to enhance low-surface brightness features, but are not at the same resolution. The four optical components identified by Lacy\n& Rawlings (1994) are indicated in the F814W image. The linear feature extending from the bottom of the two HST images is a diffraction spike from the\nbright star south of 3C 356.\n4 THE NATURE OF GALAXIES \u2018A\u2019 AND \u2018B\u2019\nAs mentioned in Section 1 there has been considerable debate con-\ncerning whether galaxy \u2018a\u2019 or galaxy \u2018b\u2019 hosts the jet-producing\nAGN responsible for feeding the large-scale radio emission. We\nreconsider the location of the radio source\u2019s central engine in this\nsection, and to aid the discussion we show close-ups of the region\naround the two galaxies in all four filters in Fig. 6.\nWe first consider the morphologies of both galaxies. Radial\nsurface brightness profiles were constructed in the K\u2032 band and\nfit using the two-dimensional routine of Simpson, Ward & Wall\n(2000). The results are shown in Fig. 7, and we obtained half-\nlight radii of 0.\u2032\u203236 (2.9 kpc) and 1.\u2032\u203261 (13.1 kpc) for \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019,\nrespectively. In neither case was a significant nuclear excess re-\nquired to obtain a good fit. Both galaxies lie on the Kormendy re-\nlation for massive ellipticals after accounting for passive evolution\nin the manner of Best, Longair & Ro\u00a8ttgering (1998), and, assum-\ning no further merger activity, will evolve into \u223c 3L\u2217 galaxies by\nthe present epoch. Our radius for \u2018a\u2019 is much smaller than the 0.\u2032\u20329\ndetermined by Best et al. (1998); we attribute their result to their\nmuch poorer seeing and the use of a one-dimensional fitting algo-\nrithm which is extremely sensitive to errors in the sky level and\ncompanion objects, and improperly weights the data (see Simpson\net al. 2000 and Taylor et al. 1996 for more details). The profile of\n\u2018b\u2019 has an excess at radii >\n\u223c\n1.\u2032\u20325, similar to that of a cD galaxy;\nhowever, a visual inspection of our image clearly reveals that this\nexcess is not azimuthally-symmetric and is caused by filamentary-\nlike structures emanating from galaxy \u2018b\u2019.\n4.1 The location(s) of the AGN(s)\nWhile Lacy & Rawlings (1994) favoured \u2018b\u2019 as the source of the\nradio jets and suggested that \u2018a\u2019 was the site of a jet\u2013cloud inter-\naction, later spectropolarimetric observations have revealed scat-\ntered broad line emission from \u2018a\u2019, and energetic arguments indi-\ncate that these lines originate locally (Cimatti et al. 1997). Galaxy\n\u2018a\u2019 is therefore a true AGN, whose optical polarization has its elec-\ntric vector position angle accurately perpendicular to the axis of the\ngalaxy\u2019s \u2018dumbbell\u2019 structure (Best et al. 1997). The dumbbell axis\nis in turn roughly aligned with the radio axis and, of course, the\nvector joining \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019. Together with the high optical polariza-\ntion of \u2018a\u2019, these facts suggest that much of the blue emission from\n\u2018a\u2019 is reflected from a luminous buried quasar; this also explains\nthe much bluer colour of object \u2018a\u2019 (R \u2212 K\u2032 = 4.1, compared to\nR\u2212K\u2032 = 5.6 for \u2018b\u2019). The discovery of weak optical polarization\nwith a broadly similar electric vector position angle in \u2018b\u2019 could\nFigure 7. Radial surface brightness profiles of components \u2018a\u2019 (triangles)\nand \u2018b\u2019 (stars) in the K \u2032-band, together with best fits (solid lines), deter-\nmined from the two-dimensional data.\nmean that some of this light is being scattered by material associ-\nated with \u2018b\u2019 (Cimatti et al. 1997). The low excitation [O II] line\nemission in \u2018b\u2019 could also plausibly be excited by the quasar in \u2018a\u2019.\nIt is the nature of galaxy \u2018b\u2019 which is therefore unclear, and we\ninvestigate further here. We first briefly revisit the three arguments\nof Lacy & Rawlings (1994) to favour \u2018b\u2019 as the radio galaxy. One\nwas based on theK-band magnitudes of the two objects. According\nto Eales & Rawlings\u2019 (1990) photometry, \u2018b\u2019 lay on the K\u2013z rela-\ntion for 3C radio galaxies, while \u2018a\u2019 was too faint. More recent data\nindicate that the magnitudes of components \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019 in standard\n63.9-kpc apertures are 16.98\u00b10.05 and 16.71\u00b10.04, respectively\n(from the UKIRT data of Simpson et al. 1999; the increased ac-\ncuracy of our Subaru data is outweighed by the uncertainty in the\nK\u2032 \u2212 K colours), with a small (\u223c 7%) amount of emission-line\ncontamination to the broad-band magnitude of \u2018a\u2019. Both are there-\nfore consistent with the K\u2013z relation for powerful radio galaxies\n(e.g. Simpson et al. 1999). Lacy & Rawlings (1994) also noted the\n1.\u2032\u20325 displacement of \u2018a\u2019 from the line joining the radio hotspots, but\nthis is not unusual among powerful radio galaxies (e.g., 3C 55 and\n3C 265 from Fernini et al. 1993). The remaining argument of Lacy\n& Rawlings, which we study in more detail here, is the flat radio\nspectrum of \u2018b\u2019 compared to the steep spectrum of \u2018a\u2019 (Fernini et\nal. 1993).\nPowerful jet-producing AGN have traditionally been believed\nto have flat-spectrum radio cores so the spectrum of \u2018b\u2019 seems typi-\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nThe radio galaxy 3C 356 and clues to the trigger mechanisms for powerful radio sources 7\ncal whilst that of \u2018a\u2019 between 5 and 8.4 GHz seems unusually steep\n(\u03b1 = 1.1, S\u03bd \u221d \u03bd\u2212\u03b1; Fernini et al. 1993). However, Athreya et\nal. (1997) studied 12 powerful high-redshift (z > 2) radio galaxies\nand found that three have cores at least as steep as that of galaxy \u2018a\u2019,\nEven allowing for the slightly higher rest-frame frequencies probed\nby their study, this no longer seems to be a strong argument against\nhaving \u2018a\u2019 as the source of the radio jets. particularly as its spec-\ntrum flattens dramatically below 5 GHz (\u03b151.5 < 0.3; Fernini et al.\n1993).\nHaving negated the arguments of Lacy & Rawlings (1994)\nagainst \u2018a\u2019 being the core of the radio source, we note that the ob-\nserved arm-length asymmetry in 3C 356 favours it. If \u2018a\u2019 is the\nradio galaxy, the fractional separation distance (Bahati 1980) is\nx = 0.19, while if \u2018b\u2019 is the correct ID, x = 0.34. In the sample\nof 95 FR II 3CRR radio sources (72 radio galaxies and 23 quasars)\nstudied by Best et al. (1995), only 4 radio galaxies and 2 quasars\nhave x > 0.34, while there are 14 radio galaxies and 9 quasars with\nx > 0.19. We find similar numbers from the slightly larger sam-\nple of Arshakian & Longair (2000). We will discuss the arm-length\nasymmetry further in Section 4.2.2.\nWe also note that our new near-infrared spectroscopy clearly\nplaces \u2018a\u2019 on the [O III]\u2013radio luminosity correlation of Jackson\n& Rawlings (1997), while our limit for \u2018b\u2019 falls far below it and\nis a factor of >\n\u223c\n2 below all other upper limits. We therefore reach\nthe opposite conclusion to Eales & Rawlings (1990) and Lacy &\nRawlings (1994), namely that \u2018a\u2019 not \u2018b\u2019 is more likely to be the\njet-producing AGN, although only a deeper radio observation re-\nvealing jets will provide a conclusive result.\nIf \u2018a\u2019 is the core of the radio source, however, we are left\nwith the problem of explaining the radio emission from galaxy \u2018b\u2019,\nwhich is several orders of magnitude more luminous than is typi-\ncal of normal galaxies (e.g. Fabbiano et al. 1987). A flat spectrum\nsuggests optically-thin thermal emission from a starburst, but the\nbrightness temperature at a rest-frame frequency, \u03bdtest, of 10 GHz\nis TB > 4300K, which is too high (cf. Condon et al. 1991). Al-\nternatively, we could be seeing the turnover in a \u2018normal\u2019 star-\nburst spectrum (i.e. thermal plus non-thermal emission) where the\nfree\u2013free optical depth is unity at \u03bdrest \u223c 10GHz. In such a\ncase, the observed 8.4-GHz flux is approximately equal parts ther-\nmal and non-thermal emission (equation 7 of Condon et al. 1991),\nand the implied production rate of ionizing photons is therefore\nNUV \u223c 10\n57 s\u22121 (Condon & Yin 1990). This corresponds to a star\nformation rate of\u223c 104M\u2299 yr\u22121 (Kennicutt 1982), far in excess of\nthe limits from the H\u03b2 and submillimetre emission (Archibald et al.\n2001). A more plausible explanation is offered from the similarity\nbetween the ultraviolet\u2013optical spectrum of component \u2018b\u2019 (Cimatti\net al. 1997 plus our CGS4 data) and that of the LINER NGC 1052\n(Gabel et al. 2000). Both are core-dominated, flat-spectrum ra-\ndio sources (Wrobel 1984), and NGC 1052 is an order of mag-\nnitude less luminous in both line and radio emission, suggesting\nthat 3C 356b is simply a scaled-up version of the low-redshift ob-\nject. The implication is that the radio emission, and potentially the\nnarrow line emission, from galaxy \u2018b\u2019 is caused by a second, sep-\narate AGN. Although it might seem perverse to demand the pres-\nence of a second AGN, very similar systems are known to exist,\nsuch as the two flat-spectrum ellipticals near the centre of the low-\nredshift giant radio galaxy 3C 326 (Rawlings et al. 1990), or the\ndouble-nucleus radio galaxy 3C 75 (Owen et al. 1985) and in the\nnext section we describe how they may have been synchronously\ntriggered.\nFigure 8.

The inset shows these regions superimposed\non the J-band image. The photometry has been normalized to the K \u2032 flux,\nand some of the points have been slightly offset horizontally for clarity.\nOverplotted are the spectra (at z = 1.08) of a 4.3-Gyr-old elliptical plus\na 50-Myr-old instantaneous burst which contributes (from bottom to top)\n0,10,20,30,40% of the K \u2032-band light.\n4.2 Evidence that \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019 suffered an interpenetrating\ncollision\nOur new deep near-infrared images of 3C 356 (Fig. 6) confirm the\nimpression from the HST data (e.g. Best et al. 1997) that galaxy\n\u2018b\u2019 is highly disturbed; Best et al. suggest that this disturbance is\ncaused by an interaction with the southern radio jet from \u2018a\u2019. We\nargue here that an attractive alternative explanation is that \u2018a\u2019 and\n\u2018b\u2019 suffered an interpenetrating collision around the time the jets\nfrom 3C 356 were first triggered.\n4.2.1 Nature of the debris\nVisual inspection of Fig. 6 shows that the 3C356 \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019 system\nis very reminiscent of a pair of colliding galaxies (see, e.g., fig. 3\nof Struck 1999). A \u2018bridge\u2019 can clearly be seen pointing from \u2018b\u2019\ntowards \u2018a\u2019, and there is additional emission to the north and east\nof \u2018b\u2019, including an arc-like feature which is bright in the optical\nimages and a filament arcing northwards. Component \u2018c\u2019 (detected\nin [O II] by Lacy & Rawlings 1994) is also between the two main\ngalaxies.\nIn Fig. 8 we plot the four-colour broad-band SEDs of four re-\ngions of debris, plus the galaxies \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019. These are compared to\nthe SEDs (from Fioc & Rocca-Volmerange 1997) of a 4.3-Gyr-old\nE galaxy (a good fit to galaxy \u2018b\u2019) combined with varying frac-\ntions of a 50-Myr-old (see Section 4.2.2) instantaneous starburst\n(note that the starburst model has an essentially flat spectrum and\ncould therefore be equally representative of scattered quasar light).\nA discrepancy between the observed J \u2212K\u2032 colours and those of\nthe models is noted, but is hard to explain given the agreement in\nFig. 5. With the exception of the very blue (R \u2212K\u2032 \u2248 3.2) com-\nponent \u2018c\u2019, the rest of the debris is well-modelled by a combination\nwhere only 5\u201320 per cent of the K\u2032-band light (and hence 1\u20135 per\ncent of the stellar mass) originates from young stars (if the normal-\nization is made to the J-band photometry, this mass fraction rises\nto\u223c 10% for galaxy \u2018a\u2019 and the region to the northeast of \u2018b\u2019). It is\nclear, therefore, that the extended light in the system cannot be due\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n8 C. Simpson and S. Rawlings\nsolely to recent star formation caused, for example, by the passage\nof the radio jets, but must be predominantly composed of old stars\ndisturbed during the collision between \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019.\nWhile there is remarkably little discussion in the literature of\nwhat happens when two massive ellipticals interpenetrate, one im-\nportant mode by which material can be ripped from a galaxy is me-\ndiated by tidal torques (e.g. Struck 1999) which obviously affects\nstars as well as gas, and so there seems to be no physical reason\nwhy the debris cannot be material stripped from \u2018b\u2019 (indeed, the\ncolours of \u2018b\u2019 and the \u2018bridge\u2019 are very similar; Fig. 8). It seems far\nharder to find a physical process by which the disturbed structures\nof \u2018b\u2019 can be promoted by interactions with a radio jet. Lacy et al.\n(1998) present a comprehensive study of a probable jet\u2013galaxy in-\nteraction involving the radio source 3C 441, from which it seems\nclear that there are significant effects on gas in a galaxy struck by a\njet, but little or no effect on old stars since there is no obvious way\nin which the jet power can be coupled effectively to their motions.\nSimilarly, the red colours of component \u2018d\u2019 (which are very\nsimilar to those of \u2018b\u2019) imply that it is an old galaxy and\ntherefore its high velocity relative to \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019 cannot be ex-\nplained by an interaction with the radio jet in the manner pro-\nposed by Lacy & Rawlings (1994). Neither can it be explained\nas a result of a strong gravitational interaction with the two\nmain galaxies, since the maximum velocity which can be at-\ntained in such a scenario is vmax \u2248 (2G(Mab)\/r)1\/2 \u2248\n1000(Mab\/10\n12M\u2299)\n1\/2(r\/10 kpc)\u22121\/2 km s\u22121, where Mab is\nthe combined mass of components \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019, and r is the im-\npact parameter. Neither does component \u2018d\u2019 appear to be disturbed,\nalthough it does possess weak [O II] emission. We are therefore\nleft with the rather unsatisfying conclusion that it is an unrelated\nbackground galaxy.\n4.2.2 Time-scales\nAdopting the physical model for FR II radio sources of Willott et al.\n(1999), we can use the observed properties of 3C 356 to estimate its\ntotal jet power Q and the time t since the jets were first triggered. If\nthe jet axis makes an angle \u03b8 with respect to the line of sight, then\nequation (11) of Willott et al. yieldsQ = 6.3\u00d71039(sin \u03b8)31\/28 W,\nwhere we have adopted the following \u2018canonical\u2019 values for the\nsource and environmental parameters discussed by Willott et al.:\nc1 = 2.3 and f = 20 (see also Blundell & Rawlings 2000); n100 =\n3000m\u22123 and \u03b2 = 1.5. Equation (9) of Willott et al. gives the age\nof the radio source as t = 3.4\u00d7 107(sin \u03b8)\u221243\/28 yr.\nSo, if the merger axis of \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019 is close in three di-\nmensions to the jet axis (e.g. West 1991; see also the discus-\nsion in the next section), then the point of closest approach hap-\npened \u223c Da\u2212b\/(\u2206v tan \u03b8) = 3.2 \u00d7 107(tan \u03b8)\u22121 yr ago, where\nDa\u2212b = 39 kpc is the projected separation between \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019,\nand \u2206v = 1200 km s\u22121 is the line-of-sight velocity difference.\nThus, accounting for uncertainties like small (\u223c 30\u25e6) misalign-\nments between the radio axis and the velocity vector of \u2018a\u2019, it looks\nhighly plausible that the jets were triggered during the interpene-\ntrating collision between \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019, a few tens of Myr in the past.\nThis simultaneity requires a pre-existing supermassive black hole\nat the centre of \u2018a\u2019, in line with the suggestion of Willott, Rawlings\n& Blundell (2001) that 1<\n\u223c\nz <\n\u223c\n2 radio galaxies are undergoing a\nrebirth.\nSince the fractional separation difference cannot be larger than\nthe expansion speed of the outer radio components, \u03b2 \u2261 vhs\/c \u2248\n0.04 (see Blundell & Rawlings 2000 for a recent discussion of ex-\npansion speeds), the large arm-length asymmetries cannot be due\nto light travel time effects, and the most likely cause is an environ-\nmental asymmetry. If so, the model of Willott et al. (1999) implies\nthat the mean density to the southeast of \u2018a\u2019 is\u223c 4 times higher than\nthat to the northwest. Radio depolarization measurements (Pedelty\net al. 1989) also indicate a denser medium to the southeast, and vi-\nsual inspection of Fig. 1 suggests that this may be linked to a larger\nconcentration of companion galaxies to the southeast, presumably\nassociated with the group containing \u2018b\u2019.\n5 DISCUSSION\nOur study of 3C 356 has led us to a model in which a powerful\njet-producing AGN and a weaker, but possibly also jet-producing,\nAGN are stimulated in the 3C 356 system as the result of an in-\nterpenetrating collision between two massive galaxies, which oc-\ncurred along an axis closely aligned with the radio jet axis. The high\nrelative velocity of \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019 indicate that they are not members\nof the same group, while the small number of companion galaxies\nsuggests that the system will relax to a relatively poor cluster, no\nricher than Abell class 0. This begs two questions which we ad-\ndress in this section. First, how do we square these inferences with\nthe X-ray properties of this system, which are more reminiscent of\na richer cluster of galaxies? And second, can the trigger mechanism\ninferred for 3C 356 be generalized to other objects with powerful\nradio jets?\n5.1 What causes the X-ray emission from 3C 356?\nThe ROSAT images of 3C 356 reveal the X-ray emission to be ex-\ntended; while there are no significant sources in the HRI image\n(Crawford & Fabian 1996), the PSPC image (Crawford & Fabian\n1993) tentatively suggests that the emission peaks to the north of\nthe radio core and is extended in the direction of the radio jets.\nThe bolometric X-ray luminosity of 3C 356 is LX \u2248 2 \u00d7 1037 W\n(Crawford & Fabian 1993, corrected to our cosmology), making it\nlie close to the luminosity\u2013temperature relation for nearby clusters\n(Fig. 9). However, as we have seen in Section 3.3, the small num-\nber of galaxies around 3C 356 does not support the existence of a\ncluster with the richness implied by the X-ray temperature.\nWe consider the possibility that the X-ray emission from\n3C 356 is a superposition of cooler, less luminous (i.e., consistent\nwith the poorness of the optical\/infrared environment) intraclus-\nter gas with an attenuated power law from the AGN in galaxy \u2018a\u2019.\nCrawford & Fabian (1996) estimate that no more than one-third of\nthe observed soft X-ray emission can arise from a point source, and\nthis would reduce the bolometric luminosity of the thermal com-\nponent (which becomes cooler due to the addition of the hard non-\nthermal emission) by a factor of \u223c 2, insufficient to invalidate the\narguments made at the end of Section 3.3.\nWe therefore turn to a scenario of merging subclusters, such\nas that proposed by Markevitch, Sarazin & Vikhlinin (1999) for\nthe cluster around Cygnus A. Suggestions that radio galaxy ac-\ntivity and cluster mergers are related have also been advanced by\nBurns et al. (1993, 1994). Markevitch et al.\u2019s model consists of two\nhot, massive clusters in the early stages of a merger, whereas the\nabove arguments suggest that 3C 356 represents the late stages of\na merger between two much less massive groups. Typical prop-\nerties for such groups are ne \u223c 103 m\u22123, kT \u223c 1\u20132 keV, and\ncore radius a \u223c 100 kpc (e.g. Kriss, Cioffi & Canizares 1983;\nMulchaey & Zabludoff 1998). When two clusters, each of mass\nM , fall from a large distance to a separation of 2a (which can\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nThe radio galaxy 3C 356 and clues to the trigger mechanisms for powerful radio sources 9\nFigure 9. Luminosity\u2013temperature relation for distant (z > 0.5) clusters\nfrom Donahue et al. (1999), Della Ceca et al. (2000), Schindler (1999), and\nFabian et al. (2001). The star represents 3C 356 and the open circle 3C 294.\nThe solid line is the relationship for nearby clusters from Wu, Xue & Fang\n(1999).\nbe considered as the start of the merger), their relative velocity\nis \u2206v = (2GM\/a)1\/2 \u2248 1000(kT\/1 keV)1\/2 km s\u22121 (i.e. very\nsimilar to the current line-of-sight velocity difference between the\ntwo main galaxies). From equations 1 and 2 of Markevitch et al.\n(1999), this results in post-shock gas with twice the temperature\nand slightly more than twice the density of the pre-shock ma-\nterial, and hence almost an order of magnitude higher emissiv-\nity (these numbers are insensitive to the exact value of the initial\ngas temperature). For a merger as advanced as that of 3C 356,\nwhere the two central galaxies have already suffered an interpen-\netrating collision, it is reasonable to assume that approximately\nhalf the gas from each group has passed through the shock front,\nand hence the X-ray luminosity of 3C 356 will be about an or-\nder of magnitude more than that of the original galaxy groups.\nSince emission from thermal bremsstrahlung has a bolometric lu-\nminosity L \u221d n2eT 1\/2, the merger causes 3C 356 to simply move\nup the luminosity\u2013temperature relation, LX \u221d T 2.72X (Wu et al.\n1999), and its X-ray properties will therefore resemble those of\na single, richer cluster (this statement is true for a wide range of\nmerger parameters). The post-shock gas has a cooling time-scale,\ntff \u223c 3nekT\/\u039b \u223c 10\n10 yr, much longer than the shock crossing\ntime, tsh \u223c a\/\u2206v \u223c 108 yr, and it will therefore dominate the ob-\nserved X-ray emission due to its much higher surface brightness.\nHigher-quality X-ray data could either spatially or spectrally sepa-\nrate the pre- and post-shock material and are obviously desirable.\nThis model can also explain the alignment effect in 3C 356,\nas well as the tentative alignment between the X-ray-emitting gas\nand the radio axis. These alignments are all secondary and arise\nbecause the radio emission, X-ray emission, and galaxy interaction\ndirection are all aligned with the direction of the cluster merger.\nThe X-ray\u2013merger alignment is the easiest to understand, since the\nX-rays arise from the gas travelling in the direction of the merger\nwhich has passed through the shock front. The line joining \u2018a\u2019 and\n\u2018b\u2019 will also be aligned with this direction since the collision ve-\nlocity between the two merging groups is larger than the velocity\ndispersion of either group and so the galaxies will approach each\nother along a vector which is biased towards the merger axis. To ex-\nplain the alignment of the radio jets, we turn to West (1994), who\nsuggested that supermassive black holes form with their spin axes\naligned with the local large scale structure, as a result of a series of\nhighly anisotropic mergers. Since the interaction between \u2018a\u2019 and\n\u2018b\u2019 is unlikely to have caused any precession of the spin axis of the\njet-producing black hole in \u2018a\u2019 (Scheuer 1992), when this dormant\nblack hole is re-fuelled (see Section 4.2.2), the radio jets will align\nwith the filament of large scale structure, along which the groups\ncontaining \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019 are presumably merging.\nWe also consider the possibility that the X-ray emission is\nboosted in a more direct way by the radio source activity. First,\nas Fabian et al. (2001) note in the case of the z = 1.786 radio\ngalaxy 3C 294, inverse-Compton scattering of CMB photons by\nlow-\u03b3 electrons can produce luminous X-rays. This mechanism re-\nquires bubbles of electrons which are spatially separated from the\nultra-relativistic material visible as high-frequency radio emission,\nbut studies of M 87 (Owen, Eilek & Kassim 2000) show that this is\nplausible, at least in this object. In addition, low-\u03b3 electrons are ob-\nserved to be distributed on large scales in merging systems where\nit is plausible that they are re-energized by shocks which would ex-\ntend their effective lifetimes (Ro\u00a8ttgering et al. 1997). As also noted\nby Fabian et al. (2001), this scenario requires two bubbles of hot\nconfining gas, which can be naturally associated with the merging\nsubclusters in our model, and therefore also predicts an alignment\nbetween the X-ray and radio axes.\nSecond, Kaiser & Alexander (1999) suggested that the X-\nray emission from 3C 356 may arise from gas in the intergalactic\nmedium which has been heated by the passage of the expanding\nradio source. However, their fig. 10 indicates that the required lu-\nminosity of \u223c 1037 W cannot be achieved for a source with a mean\narm length of\u223c 300 kpc unless the density profile index \u03b2 < 1 (we\nknow of no sources where such a flat profile has been observed)\nand\/or the IGM density is larger than their assumed value, which\nis typical of 3C radio source environments at z \u223c 1 (this same\nvalue is justified by Willott et al. 1999). Since the environment of\n3C 356 i somewhat poorer than this, a higher density is inconsistent\nwith the observations. Also, Kaiser & Alexander\u2019s model requires a\nhigher density on the north side of the radio source since the X-ray\nemission peaks to the north of the core (Crawford & Fabian 1993),\nwhich is at odds with the longer arm length if the IGM is static. Our\nmodel naturally explains this apparent discrepancy if the group ap-\nproaching from the south were denser (as we claim to be the case in\nSection 4.2.2). This gas will be the most luminous in X-rays after\nit has been compressed and heated by passing through the shock\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n10 C. Simpson and S. Rawlings\nfront to the north side. On the other hand, the radio hotspots ad-\nvance much more rapidly than the slow (\u223c 103 km s\u22121) IGM and\ntherefore work against the pre-shock material, which is denser to\nthe south.\nIt seems plausible that some X-ray emission may arise from\nprocesses directly associated with the radio source, but a full con-\nsideration of all its observed properties seem to demand that 3C 356\nis at the centre of a merger between two galaxy groups. The time-\nscales involved suggest that the radio source was triggered by the\nclose approach, or interpenetration, of the dominant galaxies from\neach group, which channelled fuel onto a dormant supermassive\nblack hole. Our observations and model are at odds with the idea of\nBremer et al. (1997) that powerful radio galaxies lie at the centres\nof rich clusters with strong cooling flows. However, the richness of\nthe cluster around 3C 356 is fairly typical of powerful radio sources\nat high redshift, and it is therefore worth investigating whether our\nmodel for 3C 356 can be applied to other radio-loud AGN.\n5.2 Our model and 3C 294\nThe radio galaxy 3C 294 has recently been observed at high res-\nolution in X-rays with Chandra (Fabian et al. 2001) and at near-\ninfrared wavelengths with Adaptive Optics on the Canada\u2013France\u2013\nHawaii and Keck Telescopes (Stockton, Canalizo & Ridgway 1999;\nQuirrenbach et al. 2001). The excellent quality of these data make\nit suitable for testing the generality of our model.\nQuirrenbach et al.\u2019s observations reveal two galaxies separated\nby \u223c 8 kpc, the brighter of which has a diffuse, clumpy morphol-\nogy, while the fainter is compact and is identified with the source of\nthe radio jets. Applying the model of Willott et al. (1999) to 3C 294,\nwe derive a jet power Q = 1.5 \u00d7 1040(sin \u03b8)31\/28 W, and an age\nof t = 4.1 \u00d7 106(sin \u03b8)\u221243\/28 yr. This much younger age is con-\nsistent with the smaller separation of the two optical components\nin 3C 294, and the (rest-frame) optical properties of this system are\nthen completely analogous to those of 3C 356 at an earlier epoch.\nIt is also worth noting that in both 3C 356 and 3C 294, the radio\nsource is identified with the more compact object, while it is the\nother galaxy which is larger and more luminous, and apparently\nmore like a brightest cluster galaxy. This appears to be at odds with\nBest et al.\u2019s (1998) suggestion that z \u223c 1 radio galaxies are (the\nprogenitors of) cD galaxies unless the galaxy systems are always\ndestined to merge.\nThe X-ray observations of 3C 294 also support a model of\nmerging clusters. The high resolution of Chandra reveals double-\nlobed (\u2018hour-glass\u2019 shaped) emission, not typical of a relaxed rich\ncluster, and more reminiscent of N -body simulations of merging\nclusters (Roettiger, Burns & Loken 1993). Our interpretation is\nthat we are observing gas which has been heated by two shocks\npropagating in opposite directions from the site of the collision.\nAs discussed above, this produces hot, bright X-ray emission along\nthe merger direction, surrounded by cooler, fainter, unshocked gas\nfrom the original clusters. As with 3C 356, a collision velocity of\n\u223c 1000\u20132000 km s\u22121 could raise the temperature from \u223c 2 keV\nto the observed 5 keV, and would result in shocks propagating at\n\u223c 500 km s\u22121 relative to the collision site. If the two components\nobserved by Quirrenbach et al. (2001) were at the centres of the two\ngroups, each shock would have travelled a distance of \u223c 100 kpc,\nconsistent with the extent of the X-ray lobes. Since the radio source\nis not triggered until much later, it is possible for the shocked gas\nto have a larger extent than the more rapidly expanding radio lobes.\nAgain, the major axis of the X-ray emission is broadly aligned with\nthe radio axis, as predicted in our model (see Section 5.1). The lack\nof alignment between the radio axis and the line joining the two\nbright galaxies can be explained by the youth of the radio source,\nsince we are seeing the two components soon after their time of\nclosest approach.\nWe use the X-ray data of 3C 294 to draw two inferences which\nare relevant in our search for a single trigger mechanism for power-\nful radio sources at these intermediate epochs. First, there is no ev-\nidence for an enhancement of the X-ray emission at the edge of the\nradio cocoon, as predicted by Kaiser & Alexander\u2019s (1999) model\nfor heating of the IGM by the radio source. Second, the highly-\npeaked X-ray surface brightness which is the signature of a cooling\nflow core is not present (the weak X-ray core coincident with the\nradio galaxy is consistent with a heavily-absorbed power law), and\ntherefore we do not believe that 3C 294 lies at the centre of an\nestablished cooling flow. Our model of merging clusters therefore\nprovides the only way to explain the properties of both 3C 356 and\n3C 294.\n5.3 Our model and Cygnus A\nOur model may also be applicable to the most luminous z < 0.5\nradio source, Cygnus A. Cyg A is the brightest galaxy in a cluster\nwhich is merging with a richer cluster (Owen et al. 1997; Marke-\nvitch et al. 1999) along an axis aligned with the radio jets. This is a\nqualitatively similar situation to that we have proposed for 3C 356\nand 3C 294, and West (1994) noted this alignment as support for his\nmodel. The quantitative differences can be easily explained. First,\nthe much richer environment is an inevitable consequence of hier-\narchical merging (Eke, Navarro & Frenk 1998), since more massive\nclusters will have had time to form by the later epoch. Second, the\nearlier stage of the cluster merger at which the radio source is cre-\nated can be explained by the higher galaxy density, since it is a\ngalaxy\u2013galaxy interaction which provides the trigger. While there\nis only tentative evidence for a galaxy merger in Cyg A (see Stock-\nton, Ridgway & Lilly 1994), there is recent star formation (Jack-\nson, Tadhunter & Sparks 1998) whose (admittedly highly uncer-\ntain) age is consistent with the age of the radio source (\u223c 6.4Myr).\nAlthough very violent interactions are responsible for triggering\nthe radio sources 3C 356 and 3C 294, the weaker interaction in\nthe case of Cyg A may still be sufficient to trigger nuclear activity,\nsince fuel is likely to be plentiful as a result of the massive cool-\ning flow (M\u02d9 \u223c 250M\u2299 yr\u22121; Reynolds & Fabian 1996). Unlike at\nz \u223c 1, where the interaction must provide fuel and drive it into the\nnucleus of the active galaxy, Cyg A only requires a relatively small\ngravitational perturbation to disturb the reservoir of gas which is\nalready present. We note that the weaker, yet still extremely power-\nful, radio source 3C 295 also lies at the centre of a massive cooling\nflow (Allen et al. 2001) and appears to be undergoing an interaction\n(Smail et al. 1997) which could provide fuel to power the nuclear\naccretion. We therefore offer support for the model of Bremer et al.\n(1997) when applied to low-redshift sources where cooling flows\nhave been set up, and suggest that the unspecified trigger mecha-\nnism is a galaxy\u2013galaxy interaction.\n5.4 The trigger mechanism(s) for powerful radio sources\nA powerful radio source requires (i) a supermassive, presumably\nspinning, black hole; (ii) available fuel; and (iii) a mechanism for\ndelivering this fuel to an accretion disc around the black hole.\nThe formation of the black hole is likely to be accompanied by\na period of AGN activity, as fuel is plentiful. This is believed to be\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nThe radio galaxy 3C 356 and clues to the trigger mechanisms for powerful radio sources 11\nthe evolutionary state of the highest-redshift (z >\n\u223c\n3) radio sources.\nSince black holes are not destroyed, lower-redshift radio sources\nrequire only fuel and a suitable delivery mechanism to be triggered\nin a suitable host galaxy. At intermediate redshifts (1<\n\u223c\nz <\n\u223c\n2), el-\nliptical galaxies do not have large internal reservoirs of gas, and our\nstudy of 3C 356 and 3C 294 suggests that fuel can be made avail-\nable and delivered by a violent galaxy\u2013galaxy interaction which is\nmost likely to be orchestrated by the merger of two groups or clus-\nters of galaxies. We suggest that this is likely to be a very important,\npotentially dominant, trigger mechanism for powerful radio sources\nat these cosmological epochs. At even lower redshifts (z <\n\u223c\n1), fuel\nmay become readily available from a cooling flow (Bremer et al.\n1997), and therefore a less violent trigger is required to perturb the\ngas onto the black hole.\nThe steep decline in the number density of extragalactic ra-\ndio sources from z \u223c 1 to the present epoch (e.g. Dunlop & Pea-\ncock 1990; Willott et al. 2001) can be understood in terms of the\ncurrently-favoured low matter-density Universe as the end of the\nera of cluster formation via group\u2013group mergers, and hence the\nend of the epoch of violent interactions which can fuel dormant\nblack holes. It is worth pointing out that this is precisely the oppo-\nsite conclusion to that reached by Fabian & Crawford (1990), who\nsuggested that cluster mergers turned off quasars since it was then\nbelieved that \u2126m = 1 and hence massive clusters formed at a much\nlater epoch.\nOur model, if applicable to intermediate-redshift radio sources\nin general, has an important implication for the use of radio sources\nto locate clusters at z >\n\u223c\n1, as it predicts that these radio-selected\nclusters are likely to be merging systems. These systems are atyp-\nical and cannot be used to infer details about the evolution of the\ncluster X-ray luminosity function. However, proving that these sys-\ntems are not simply relaxed clusters is likely to be difficult since the\nX-ray luminosity and temperature of these systems mimic those\nof a single, richer cluster (see Section 5.1). In addition, while the\nmerger directions of radio galaxies lie close to the plane of the sky\nand therefore should produce elongated X-ray emission, radio-loud\nquasars lie in systems which are merging along axes close to the\nline of sight, and projection effects will make it much harder to\nobserve evidence of a merger. Even some radio galaxies may be\nproduced by mergers close to the line of sight, due to a combina-\ntion of misalignments between the axes cluster and galaxy mergers,\nand between the axes of the galaxy merger and the radio emission.\n6 SUMMARY\nWe have demonstrated with new deep near-infrared imaging the ab-\nsence of a rich cluster around the z = 1.08 radio galaxy 3C 356,\napparently at odds with the observed X-ray emission. We have pro-\nposed that the X-rays arise from shocked gas at the interface of\ntwo merging galaxy groups and that the two components of 3C 356\nsuffered a strong interaction during this merger, stripping material\nfrom one or both galaxies and funnelling it into the nucleus of \u2018a\u2019,\nwhich we believe is the source of the radio jets (although we believe\nthat \u2018b\u2019 is also an AGN). We have proposed an identical scenario\nfor the z = 1.786 radio galaxy 3C 294, and have suggested that\nthis mechanism may be the dominant trigger for radio sources at\n1<\n\u223c\nz <\n\u223c\n2. We have suggested that less violent galaxy interactions\nmay trigger lower-redshift radio sources where a cooling flow has\nset up a reservoir of fuel in the host galaxy. This model explains the\nrapid decline in the number density of these objects since z \u223c 1,\nand also implies that galaxy clusters located by using radio sources\nwill be an extremely biased sample inappropriate for learning about\ncluster formation and evolution. It is vital to establish the ways in\nwhich the radio source can directly influence the observed X-ray\nproperties, and also to understand how the triggering of a radio\nsource may be intimately related to the evolution of its environ-\nment.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe wish to thank Roberto de Propris for giving up valuable ob-\nserving time to obtain the CGS4 spectra, and Adam Stanford and\nCurtis Struck for useful discussions.
