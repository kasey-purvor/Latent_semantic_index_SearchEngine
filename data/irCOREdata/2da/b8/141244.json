The majority of the recent research published in the\ninternational literature has been conducted in Australia and southern Africa. Leaf\/stem extension is a\nmore sensitive indicator of the onset of water stress than stomatal conductance or photosynthesis. Possible\nmechanisms by which cultivars differ in their responses to drought have been described. Roots extend in\ndepth at rates of 5\u201318 mm d\u22121 reaching maximum depths of > 4 m in ca. 300 d providing there are no\nphysical restrictions. The Penman-Monteith equation and the USWB Class A pan both give good estimates\nof reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo). The corresponding values for the crop coefficient (Kc) are 0.4\n(initial stage), 1.25 (peak season) and 0.75 (drying off phase). On an annual basis, the total water-use (ETc)\nis in the range 1100\u20131800 mm, with peak daily rates of 6\u201315 mm d\u22121. There is a linear relationship\nbetween cane\/sucrose yields and actual evapotranspiration (ETc) over the season, with slopes of about\n100 (cane) and 13 (sugar) kg (ha mm)\u22121 (but variable). Water stress during tillering need not result in a\nloss in yield because of compensatory growth on re-watering. Water can be withheld prior to harvest for\nperiods of time up to the equivalent of twice the depth of available water in the root zone. As alternatives\nto traditional furrow irrigation, drag-line sprinklers and centre pivots have several advantages, such as\nallowing the application of small quantities of water at frequent intervals. Drip irrigation should only\nbe contemplated when there are well-organized management systems in place. Methods for scheduling\nirrigation are summarized and the reasons for their limited uptake considered. In conclusion, the \u2018drivers\nfor change\u2019, including the need for improved environmental protection, influencing technology choice if\nirrigated sugar cane production is to be sustainable are summarized.\nI N T RO D U C T I O N\nSugar cane is grown in diverse areas of the world ranging from warm temperate regions\nto the humid tropics. In many places, water management is a major component of\nthe production system. In some countries (e.g. Swaziland) irrigation is essential for\nprofitable commercial production while in others (e.g. South Africa) it is supplementary\nto variable rainfall. Much research has been reported on the water relations and\nirrigation requirements of sugar cane, most recently from Australia and South Africa.\nThis paper attempts to synthesize this research from an independent perspective and\n\u2020Emeritus Professor\n\u2021Corresponding author. mikecarr@cwms.org.uk; Contact address: Pear Tree Cottage, Frog Lane, Ilmington, Shipston\non Stour, Warwickshire, CV36 4LQ, UK\n2 M .

It begins with a\nsummary of the origin and centres of production, followed by reviews of the effects of\nwater stress on crop development processes (including roots), plant water relations, crop\nwater requirements, water productivity, irrigation systems and irrigation scheduling.\nThe paper concludes with a section on the \u2018drivers for change\u2019 in the sugar cane\nindustry including the need to use water and energy more efficiently, and to minimize\nenvironmental degradation in cost effective ways.\nVarious aspects of this topic have previously been reviewed by Finkel (1983), Yates\n(1984), Jones et al. (1990), Inman-Bamber and Smith (2005) and Martin et al. (2007).\nC E N T R E S O F P RO D U C T I O N\nSaccharum officinarum (the so-called Noble Cane because of its fine thick stem) is believed\nto have originated in the islands of the South Pacific, probably New Guinea (2\u201310\u25e6S)\nhaving evolved through human selection from strains of two wild species S. robustum\nand S. spontaneum and hybridization with S. sinense (Bull and Glasziou, 1976; Jones\net al., 1990; Julien et al., 1989; Purseglove, 1972; Simmonds, 1998). Because of its\nnatural sweetness, it has been grown for chewing since ancient times in the Pacific and\nSoutheast Asia. The production of sugar from sugar cane began in India, followed by\nChina, Persia (Iran), Egypt and Spain, and elsewhere around the Mediterranean. In\nthe seventeenth century the first plantations were established in the West Indies, and\nthe resultant need for labour, particularly for harvesting, led to sugar cane\u2019s links with\nthe slave trade.\nMost of the commerce between Europe and the sugar regions of the West that\nfollowed was subsequently based on the outward shipment of slaves and the homeward\ncarriage of sugar, molasses and rum (Hobhouse, 1985; Purseglove, 1972). Molasses,\nthe dark brown viscous liquid residue left behind after the centrifugal process has\nended and no more sucrose can be extracted, is one of the most important by-\nproducts (contains 50% fermentable sugars) from the manufacture of cane sugar.\nIt is used as a raw material in industry. Rum is produced by the fermentation of\nmolasses, followed by distillation. Other products include industrial ethyl alcohol\n(ethanol), which is manufactured from molasses, and bagasse, the fibrous residue left\nafter the extraction of juice from the cane (used for fuel in the sugar factory, as well as\nin various manufacturing processes). The pith from the bagasse is used as a stockfeed.\nNot much of the plant is wasted.\nUp to the end of the nineteenth century, only a few clones of S. officinarum had\nbeen used to establish the major portion of the world\u2019s sugar cane industry (Bull and\nGlasziou, 1976). Almost all the commercial cultivars grown today are interspecific\nhybrids of Saccharum species specially bred during the twentieth century, mainly for\ndisease and pest resistance (Purseglove, 1972).\nSugar cane, a C4 carbon fixation pathway species, is adapted to a range of tropical\nand subtropical climates, and is grown from southern Spain (37\u25e6N) to South Africa\n(30\u25e6S), and from sea level up to 1700 m near the equator. The optimum air temperature\nWater requirements of sugar cane 3\nfor growth is in the range 28\u201330\u25e6C whilst the base temperature varies with the\ndevelopment stage from 12 to 19\u25e6C (Liu et al., 1998). Sugar cane can be grown on a\ndiverse range of soils (Jones et al., 1990)1. In 2007, the top 10 countries in terms of\nvalue and total annual production were Brazil, India (by far the two biggest), China,\nThailand, Mexico, Pakistan, Australia, Colombia, USA and Guatemala (FAO, 2009).\nIn 2007, the total harvested area of sugar cane in the world was about 22.7 million\nha (FAO, 2009) of which about 10.2 million ha (45%) were irrigated (Portmann et al.,\n2008).\nIn Brazil alone, the planted area of sugar cane is 8 million ha producing 650 million t\nof cane (fresh weight) in 2008 of which about 45% is used for ethanol production. Only\nabout 1% of the total area is currently irrigated, but this is liable to increase (Laclau and\nLaclau, 2009). In Australia, about 60% of the sugar produced depends on irrigation\nto some extent. Regional water supplies there are becoming increasingly limited,\nand there is rising pressure on growers to improve their on-farm water management\npractices (Inman-Bamber, 2004). In South Africa about 40% of the crop depends on\nirrigation (Inman-Bamber and Smith, 2005).\nC RO P D E V E L O P M E N T\nSugar cane is a perennial crop in which flowering is undesirable. The crop is produced\nfrom stalk cuttings called setts. Each node has an axillary bud and a band of root\nprimordia, and is capable of giving rise to a new plant. The \u2018germination\u2019 of setts\nrequires moist soil surrounding the stem. The developing bud is initially dependent\non the sett for nutrients and water, but it develops its own root system after about\nthree weeks. Once the new plant is established, roots arise from underground nodes\nand the axillary buds at these nodes give rise to tillers (Bull and Glasziou, 1976). As\nthe crop develops there is an overproduction of tillers (stalks), with peak numbers (up\nto 25 m\u22122) attained three to five months from planting, but 50% of these can die (as a\nresult of shading) before a stable stalk population is reached after about nine months.\nTiller senescence begins when about 70% of incident radiation is intercepted by the\nleaf canopy (Inman-Bamber, 1994).\nThe effects of water stress on crop development processes are considered here in the\nfollowing sequence: leaf canopy, yield accumulation (grand growth), ripening\/drying-\noff, flowering and ratoons, ending with a summary of factors influencing the\ndevelopment of root systems.\nLeaf canopy\nIn a review, Inman-Bamber and Smith (2005) summarized the stages of vegetative\ngrowth and the influence of water stress as follows.\n\u2022 Leaf initiation continues even when leaf appearance is impeded by dry soil.\n1The reader is referred to a review paper by Sumner (1997), focusing on sugar cane, which describes the chemical\nand physical degradation of soils resulting from organic matter depletion, crust formation, acidification, salinization\nand sodification. Available strategies for amelioration and case studies with successful outcomes are discussed.\n4 M . K . V. C A R R A N D J. W. K N OX\n\u2022 Leaf extension is sensitive to water stress declining, for example, from 40 mm d\u22121,\nwhen the leaf water potential at midday is \u22120.5 MPa, to zero when the leaf water\npotential falls to \u22121.3 MPa (cvs NCo376 and N11).\n\u2022 Stem extension rates are more sensitive to water stress than leaf extension rates.\n\u2022 Compensatory growth can occur when water stress is relieved; e.g. the relative\nleaf extension rate (the ratio of actual leaf extension rate to that of the control\nwell-watered treatment) can exceed 1.0 within three days of rain.\nSubsequently, Smit and Singels (2006) reported the results of a study in South Africa\n(29\u25e642\u2032S; 31\u25e602\u2032E; alt. 96 m) of the effects of controlled water stress on leaf canopy\ndevelopment. They found that leaf senescence was affected most by drought, followed\nby leaf appearance and then tiller senescence.\nThere were differences in response between cultivars. For example, cv. NCo376\nwas able to maintain canopy development processes, particularly slower rates of tiller\nand leaf senescence, for longer than cv. N22 as the soil dried, at least initially. At the\nsame time, cv. NCo376 was also able to maintain stomatal conductances and leaf\nwater potentials at higher levels than cv. N22 (a cultivar known commercially as being\ndrought sensitive).\nSimilarly, in a preliminary pot experiment, cultivar N11 appeared to be better\nadapted to water stress than cv. NCo376 since it could adjust its leaf area more rapidly\nand tended to elongate at a slightly lower leaf water potential than cv. NCo376. This\nconcurred with the results of field trials in South Africa in which cv. N11 produced\nhigher sucrose yields than cv. NCo376 in dry conditions, but not under irrigation\n(Inman-Bamber and De Jager, 1986).\nYield accumulation\/grand growth\nIn sugar cane, sucrose is stored in the stalk parenchyma cells. Accumulation is a\ncontinuous process throughout the life of the plant. In commercial varieties, sucrose\nconcentration increases from 10% (dry mass) in young plants to about 50% as they\nmature (Julien et al., 1989). In commercial production, sucrose yield is commonly\nexpressed as the product of the fresh weight of stalks (cane) and sucrose concentration\n(%).\nFor well-adapted cultivars grown in Australia and South Africa, partitioning of plant\nbiomass to above ground organs is similar for a wide range of climatic conditions, with\nthe trash component (dead leaves and stalks) varying most (Inman-Bamber et al., 2002).\nFor crops yielding > 60 t ha\u22121 dry mass (green biomass = biomass less the trash),\nthe stalk component reached a maximum value of about 0.85 regardless of cultivar or\nextremes of water regime. Seasonal and age effects on whole stalk sucrose content are\ndue to varying proportions of young segments (low sucrose content) and older segments\n(high). From a comparison of high and low sucrose content clones, Inman-Bamber et al.\n(2009) concluded that there is little direct genetic control on the maximum amount of\nsucrose that can accumulate in the stalk. Rather, differences between cultivars reside\nmore in the morphology of the plant and responses to ripening stimuli such as mild\nwater stress.\nWater requirements of sugar cane 5\nIn Ayr, Queensland (19\u25e632\u2032S, 147\u25e625\u2032E; altitude 15 m asl), Inman-Bamber (2004)\nreported the responses of two cultivars (Q96 and Q124), both with well-developed\nleaf canopies, to increasing soil water deficits. Yield-forming processes responded in\nthe following sequence as stress levels increased. Under high evaporating conditions\n(ETc up to 7.5 mm d\u22121):\n\u2022 Leaf and stalk extension rates declined when the measured soil water deficit (SWD)\nwas ca. 60 mm, reaching very low levels at a SWD of 130 mm;\n\u2022 The number of green leaves per stalk was reduced at a SWD of 80 mm;\n\u2022 Biomass accumulation declined at a SWD of 130 mm; and\n\u2022 Sucrose yield declined at a SWD of 150 mm.\nFor comparison, the total available water content in the root zone was >230 mm.\nRipening\/drying-off\nThis relative sensitivity of expansive growth to water stress compared with\nphotosynthesis means that sucrose is diverted from growth to storage in the stem, a\nphenomenon exploited by the practice of \u2018drying-off\u2019 before harvest (Inman-Bamber\nand Smith, 2005).\nIn irrigated sugar cane production, water is usually withheld prior to harvest (i)\nto dry the field and (ii) to raise the sucrose concentration of the cane. Because past\nresearch had given conflicting results on the optimum duration of the drying-off\nperiod, Robertson and Donaldson (1998) undertook a detailed analysis of pooled data\nfrom 37 experiments (mainly cv. NCo376) conducted in Southern Africa. In only 22%\nof the drying-off treatments (total 174) was there a significant increase in the yield\nof sucrose, averaging 8% (maximum 15%), over the well-watered control treatment.\nThis increase occurred when the reduction in cane yield (dry mass) was no greater\nthan about 10%. In 61% of the drying-off treatments there was a significant increase\nin the sucrose concentration (% fresh mass), as a result of an increase in the soluble\nsolids together with dehydration. However, sucrose yields only increase if water stress\nreduces stalk biomass by less than 4% (Donaldson and Bezuidenhout, 2000). Using this\ninformation, the CANEGRO model (ICSM, 2008) was used to simulate the optimum\ndrying-off period (for crops harvested annually) for different soil types, locations and\nmonth of harvest in South Africa. A set of tables was produced, with adjustments\ndepending on anticipated rainfall. As a general rule, this equated to the time it would\ntake for the cumulative total evaporation from a pan to equal twice the water holding\ncapacity of the soil (depth not specified) in which the crop was grown.\nThe results of a one year duration experiment in Swaziland with a ratoon crop (cv.\nNCo376), confirmed that there was no reduction in the yield of cane if water was\nwithheld for either seven or ten weeks. This was equivalent to cumulative evaporation\nprior to harvest 1.5 and three times the total available water in the root zone (80 mm),\nrespectively. There was a minor improvement in cane quality through an increase in\nsucrose content (Ellis and Lankford, 1990).\n6 M . K . V. C A R R A N D J. W. K N OX\nFlowering\nAlthough nearly all sugar cane species and varieties flower (\u2018arrow\u2019), producing\nlarge panicles of tiny flowers and fertile seed, selection programmes are biased against\nflowering. Most varieties will not flower at day lengths longer than about 13 h or\nshorter than 12 h (Bull and Glasziou, 1976). Water stress can delay flowering if it occurs\nbefore flower inductive conditions arise. The effect of flowering on yield is complex\nand dependent on several factors and is not always deleterious (Julien et al., 1989).\nRatoons\nA ratoon refers to the regrowth of a cane crop after harvesting. New shoots develop\nfrom the axillary buds of the stubble piece. In Swaziland, Ellis and Lankford (1990)\nfound that, providing the plant crop was irrigated immediately after harvest, the ratoon\ncrop did not need to be irrigated again until the onset of rapid shoot elongation. The\nplant crop is usually followed by up to eight ratoons, sometimes more depending on\nthe rate of yield decline.\nIn tropical Queensland, Australia (18.7\u25e6S, 146.2\u25e6E; altitude 150 m asl) ratoon\ncrops accumulated biomass faster than plant crops (both irrigated) during the first\n100 days due to higher stalk number, faster canopy development and more radiation\ninterception (Robertson et al., 1996). These differences became negligible after\n220 days because maximum radiation use efficiency was larger in the plant crop (1.72 g\nMJ\u22121, excluding trash) than in the first ratoon (1.59 g MJ\u22121). Biomass accumulation\nreached a plateau (53\u201358 t ha\u22121) after 300 days from planting\/ratooning, 140 days\nbefore harvest. This plateau was associated with the loss of live millable stalks, and not\nwith a cessation of growth of individual stalks. Over the 15-month season the crops\nintercepted about 70% of the incident radiation. This study emphasized the point that\nmaximizing early radiation interception does not necessarily lead to higher yields.\nSummary: crop development\n1. Moist soil is needed to establish a sett.\n2. Stem\/leaf extension is particularly sensitive to water stress.\n3. An excess of tillers is produced, some die due to shading.\n4. Maximizing early radiation interception is not necessary.\n5. Compensatory growth occurs when dry soil is rewetted.\n6. Water can be withheld prior to harvest without loss of yield.\n7. For a ratoon crop, water needs to be applied immediately after harvest.\n8. No further water is needed until rapid stem elongation begins.\nRoots\nAn excellent review of the growth and function of the sugar cane root system was\npublished by Smith et al. (2005). It focused on physical (soil compaction, high water\ntables) and genetic (differences between cultivars) factors influencing the capacity of\nroots to access water and nutrients particularly at depth, the likelihood that root\nwater status may influence assimilation through its effect on stomatal conductance\nWater requirements of sugar cane 7\n(by chemical signals), and the possibility that yield improvements by breeding may\nhave resulted from a focus on above ground components of yield at the expense of\nroots. They concluded that, because the underground carbon budget for sugar cane\nis poorly understood, more research is justified in order to improve further the access\nand utilization of resources by roots.\nFactors affecting the growth and function of the roots of sugar cane, including their\nsensitivity to soil compaction and water logging, had previously been reviewed in detail\nby Humbert (1968). Cultivars differ in the size of their root system and in the shoot\nto root ratios, which increase with increasing productivity. The maximum depths of\nrooting, as listed, varied with soil type, ranging from 0.9 to 2.2 m.\nThe root system can be divided into three types of roots: superficial, buttress and\nrope. Superficial roots are thin and branched with numerous rootlets with root hairs;\nthey exploit the upper layers of the soil. Buttress roots provide anchorage whilst rope\nroots grow down to considerable depths (Julien et al., 1989). But, as Smith et al. (2005)\npointed out, it is unclear how common rope systems are in modern cultivars. Roots\nof sugar cane are not perennial. Each new stem produces its own root system from its\nbasal nodes. The new root system cannot be formed until the soil around the base of\nthe new stem has been moistened (Yates, 1984).\nSett roots grow at a rate of up to 24 mm d\u22121. These stop elongating when they\nare 150\u2013250 mm in length and quickly produce a much-branched network of thin\nsub-roots, but these die within eight weeks of planting as roots originating from basal\nnodes of developing shoots take over. Primary shoot roots grow faster at up to 75 mm\nd\u22121 (Glover, 1967 cited by Jones et al., 1990; Thompson, 1976), and reach depths of\n1.0 m in about 120 d, 1.5 m in 160 d and 2.0 m in 190 d (Wood and Wood, 1967\ncited by Jones et al., 1990). Maximum rooting depths for sugar cane in South Africa of\nbetween 0.8 m and 4.0 m were reported by Thompson (1976) depending largely on\nsoil type. Based on observations made in a rhizotron, Van Antwerpen (1999) recorded\nroots (cv. NCo376) descending in depth at average rates of 22 mm d\u22121 in sandy soils\nand reaching maximum depths of about 2 m in 87 days. Rates of root penetration\nwere less in a sandy clay loam taking 176 days to reach the same depth. Smith et al.\n(2005) confirmed that root density (biomass and length) declines exponentially with\ndepth with roots sometimes reaching depths > 6 m.\nA detailed study of the development and distribution of roots of a plant crop (cv.\nRB72454) grown on a Xanthic Ferrasol soil with and without supplementary irrigation\nin Piracicaba, Brazil (22\u25e642\u2032S, 47\u25e633\u2032W; alt. 570 m) was reported recently by Laclau\nand Laclau (2009). For the first four months after planting the \u2018root front\u2019 extended\nat a rate of about 5 mm d\u22121, and afterwards until harvest (322 days after planting) at\nabout 18 mm d\u22121, almost independent of the water regime. Roots reached maximum\ndepths of 4.25 m with irrigation and 4.70 m when rain-fed. About 50% of the total\nnumber of root intersects were below a depth of 1 m in both treatments, as observed\non a trench wall.\nThe root systems of ratoon crops are less well developed than those of the plant\ncrop, the roots of which can remain active for a considerable period after harvest (up\nto 60 days) as the new root system develops on the developing shoot of the ratoon\n8 M .

Partial survival of the root system of the plant crop appears to provide protection\nagainst drought during the early stages of growth of the ratoon crop (Smith et al., 2005).\nSummary: roots\n1. After planting in wet soil, the sett produces short-lived, thin roots.\n2. Their function is taken over by roots that develop from basal nodes of developing\nshoots.\n3. Each stem produces its own root system.\n4. The soil needs to be moist close to the stem for roots to develop.\n5. Shoot roots extend in depth at rates varying between 5 and 22 mm d\u22121, reaching\ndepths of 1 m in about 140\u2013150 days, 2 m in 190\u2013200 days and 4 m in 300\u2013310\ndays.\n6. Providing that there are no physical restrictions (e.g. compact soil, water-logging)\nroots can be expected to reach depths of 4 m.\n7. Irrigation has a relatively small effect on root depth and distribution.\n8. After harvest, the root system of the plant crop remains active for up to 60 days.\n9. A new root system develops from the developing stem of the ratoon crop.\nP L A N T WAT E R R E L AT I O N S\nStomata are more abundant (about twice as many) on the lower (abaxial) surface of the\nleaf lamina than on the upper (adaxial) surface (Julien et al., 1989). In India, stomata\non the adaxial surface of leaves of cultivars subjected to water stress were observed to\nbe more sensitive (closed earlier) than those on the abaxial surface (Venkataramana\net al., 1986).\nIn a field study in Hawaii (21\u25e6N, 158\u25e6W; altitude 100 m asl), Meinzer and Grantz\n(1989) measured simultaneously the stomatal conductances of single leaves (steady\nstate porometer; cv. H65\u20137052) and transpiration from a developing canopy (Bowen\nratio method). Because the aerodynamic resistances were large, transpiration was not\nunder direct stomatal control (uncoupled) and, as a result, small changes in stomatal\nopenings had little effect initially on transpiration.\nSome cultivars maintain strict control over stomatal conductance during drought,\nso controlling water loss and maintaining green leaf area (Bull and Glasziou, 1976).\nWith one drought resistant Hawaiian cultivar (H69\u20138235), Inman-Bamber and Smith\n(2005) described how the stomata closed rapidly as the soil dried (\u0002m declined from 0\nto \u221240kPa). The stomata of the same cultivar were also sensitive to small changes in\nleaf water potential. Its reputation for drought resistance was considered to be a result\nin part of its capacity to conserve water through early stomatal closure. Similarly, the\nreputation that cv. N12 has in South Africa for drought resistance\/avoidance was also\nthought to be a result of early stomatal closure.\nIn Mauritius, Roberts et al. (1990) measured diurnal changes in stomatal\nconductances with a portable infra red gas analyser. The maximum values recorded\nwere around 400 \u03bcmols m\u22122 s\u22121 (measured across both leaf surfaces) in well-irrigated\ncane but less than this on days when the saturation deficit of the air (SD) was high\nWater requirements of sugar cane 9\n(ca. 1.7 kPa). Conductances were very low at leaf water potentials of \u22121.7 MPa. The\nsensitivity of stomatal conductance to changes in leaf water potential was illustrated\nunder both clear sky and cloudy conditions with full stomatal closure occurring at\nabout \u22121.8 MPa (Turner, 1990).\nIn the same series of drip irrigation experiments in Mauritius, leaf extension rate\nwas found to be more sensitive to water stress than either stomatal conductance or\nphotosynthesis. Daytime depressions of leaf extension rates were even observed in well-\nirrigated treatments during the middle of the day when evaporation rates were high.\nRecovery from water stress was always rapid (within a few days of water being applied)\nwith rates reaching levels in excess of those in the well-watered control treatments\n(Roberts et al., 1990).\nIn South Africa, Inman-Bamber and De Jager (1986) were able to relate observed\nchanges in growth processes to the decline in the midday leaf water potential (\u0002L) as\nthe soil dried:\n\u2022 Stem\/leaf extension rate is reduced and the youngest unfurled leaves begin to roll\nat \u0002L = \u22120.8 MPa.\n\u2022 Stomatal conductance starts to fall at \u0002L = \u22120.8 to \u22121.0 MPa.\n\u2022 Stem extension ceases and stomatal conductance reaches a minimum at \u0002L =\n\u22121.3 to \u22121.7MPa.\n\u2022 The youngest unfurled leaves became fully rolled at \u0002L = \u22122.0 MPa.\nOsmotic regulation has been observed in Hawaii by Koehler et al. (1982) when,\nduring drought, the concentrations of potassium and reducing sugars in the leaf blade\nincreased (cv. H62\u20134271), but only after stem elongation rates had declined. Similarly,\nin Mauritius, an osmotic adjustment at full turgor of about 0.4\u20130.6 MPa between\ndrip-irrigated and rain-fed sugar cane (cv. R570) was recorded by Roberts et al. (1990).\nAfter repeated periods of water stress, osmoregulation has also been observed in pot\ngrown plants, but to a lesser extent (Inman-Bamber and De Jager, 1986).\nSummary: plant water relations\n1. When the aerodynamic resistance is relatively large, changes in stomatal opening\ndo not have an immediate, direct effect on transpiration.\n2. Stomatal conductance is sensitive to changes in leaf water potential (possible role\nof root signals?).\n3. Some (limited) evidence of sensitivity of stomata to dry air (SD \u2265 1.7 kPa).\n4. Conductance is very low at leaf water potentials of \u22121.7 MPa.\n5. Leaf extension rate (and leaf rolling) is a more sensitive indicator of water stress\nthan stomatal conductance or photosynthesis.\n6. Drought resistance is associated with early stomatal closure.\n7. Growth processes linked to decline in midday leaf water potential as soil dries.\n8. Some (limited) evidence that osmotic regulation can occur.\n10 M . K . V. C A R R A N D J. W. K N OX\nC RO P WAT E R R E Q U I R E M E N T S\nProbably the first attempt to quantify the actual water use of sugar cane based on\nrational physical processes was that reported by Cowan and Innes (1956) in Jamaica.\nThey related monthly water use by a full canopy of cane (ETc) measured with 24\ndrainage lysimeters to the Penman equation (1948 and 1951 versions) estimate of\nevaporation from an open water surface (Eo) using standard meteorological data. The\nvalue of the ETc\/Eo ratio (f) so obtained was 0.57\u20130.58. They also found that leaf\nelongation rates were linearly related to the accumulated soil water deficit.\nIn South Africa (29\u25e626\u00b4S, 31\u25e612\u00b4E), Thompson and Boyce (1967) measured daily\nETc using four hydraulic lysimeters. They confirmed the large effects advection\ncould have along the Natal coast on ETc rates on individual days. As a result the\nPenman equation (1963 version) estimate of potential ETc was sometimes less than\nthe measured value. The most consistent relationship was between measured ETc and\nUSWB Class A evaporation pan data with a mean ratio of 1.0. Later, Thompson\nand Boyce (1971), in a comparison of large and small lysimeters, observed that ETc\nrates declined by about 30% after crops lodged (plant and ratoons), an effect that\nlasted 2\u20133 months. In a follow-up study, Thompson and Boyce (1972) compared four\nmodels of estimating ETc using standard weather data together with estimates of the\naerodynamic and canopy (stomatal) resistances, values of which were derived from\nfield measurements. The Penman-Monteith equation (1965 version) gave the best (i.e.\nclosest to weekly lysimeter measurements) estimate of ETc. Actual ETc rates fell below\npotential rates when the soil water deficit exceeded 50 mm. Because of the complexity\nof the Penman-Monteith model, and the close relationship between ETc and Epan\n(effectively 1:1), USWB Class A pans were recommended for use by irrigation water\nmanagers. This confirmed advice given earlier by Thompson et al. (1963).\nSubsequently, Thompson (1976) reviewed the research undertaken in South Africa,\nbut in the context of related work reported from Argentina, Australia, Hawaii and\nMauritius. Water-use was considered under five stages of crop development: bare soil,\npartial crop cover, complete crop cover, lodged crop and during the drying-off period\nbefore harvest. Under bare soil conditions, the effects of weeds, trash, frequency of\nwetting and soil type were considered at two sites in South Africa, and total water\nuse estimated for each situation. Similarly ETc figures were tabulated for different\ndegrees of crop cover. The ETc\/Epan ratio reached 1.0 when the crop cover (viewed\nvertically) exceeded 80\u201390% .When\/if the crop lodged, the ratio fell to about 0.7\nfor up to three months. Water use during the drying-off period fell below potential\nETc rates as irrigation water was withheld. Based on neutron probe measurements,\nThompson (1976) considered it to be realistic to assume that 50% of the total available\nwater (\u0002soil between \u22120.01 and \u22121.5 MPa) in the root zone (maximum depth) was\n\u2018freely available\u2019 to the plant. During the drying-off phase, the actual rate of water\nuse was then assumed to decline at a progressive rate until all the available water had\nbeen used.\nTotal water use varies considerably depending in part on the duration of the crop\n(Thompson, 1976). On an annual basis, it can range from 1100 to 1800 mm depending\nWater requirements of sugar cane 11\non the location (based on lysimeter data from different parts of the world). Similarly,\npeak rates of water use for sugar cane between 6 and 15 mm d\u22121 have been reported\ninternationally. There were indications that the ETc\/Epan ratio was: (i) less than\n1.0 in the winter months and (ii) lower in the ratoon crop than the plant crop.\nIn a detailed study conducted at two sites (Kalamia Estate, northeast Australia\n19\u25e66\u00b4S 14\u25e64\u00b4E, and Simunye Estate, Swaziland 26\u25e612\u00b4S, 31\u25e655\u00b4E; altitude 250 m\nasl), Inman-Bamber and McGlinchey (2003) measured daily ETc rates using the\nBowen ratio energy balance method. They confirmed that a realistic mean Kc\nvalue (ETc\/ETo) during the initial stage of crop development was 0.4, and during\nthe mid-season 1.25 (when > 80% of the incoming radiation was intercepted by\nthe canopy). For a crop that continued to be well watered Kc = 1.25 was considered\nto be appropriate until harvest but, in order to impose water stress ahead of harvest, a\nKc value of 0.7 may be desirable. (For this stage Allen et al. (1998) suggest a Kc value of\n0.75). Actual ETc rates in mid-season averaged 5.48\u00b1 0.13 mm d\u22121 in Australia and\n5.19 \u00b1 0.26 mm d\u22121 in Swaziland. The corresponding ETo (reference crop) values\nwere 4.44\u00b10.07 mm d\u22121 and 3.98\u00b10.16 mm d\u22121.\nAn attempt was made by Chabot et al. (2005) to measure transpiration of sugar cane\nin the field (Gharb plain, Morocco, 34.67\u25e6N, 8.75\u25e6W), using the sap flow technique.\nBased on measurements on 14 individual stems they found that estimates of mid-season\nETc (ca. 8 mm d\u22121) were more than 30% above those predicted from the Penman-\nMonteith equation (ETo) using the appropriate mid-season crop factor (ETc =\n1.23ETo). Although 8 mm d\u22121 is not an unrealistic value for August in that location,\nthe authors believed that the sap flow technique was an inappropriate method for\ndetermining transpiration rates from a heterogeneous canopy like that of sugar cane\nbecause of uncertainties in the methodology.\nA novel way of measuring actual water use of sugar cane was described by Omary\nand Izuno (1995) in the Everglades, south Florida, USA. They monitored daily changes\nin the height of the water table over a two-year period (plant crop and first ratoon).\nDiurnal changes in ET rates were discernible. Minimum daily values occurred in\nDecember through to February (0.7\u20131.5 mm d\u22121), and maximum rates during June\nto September (4.5\u20134.6 mm d\u22121). The total annual ET averaged 1060 mm. Crop\ncoefficients were derived for the Penman Eo estimate (1948 version), with a peak\nmid-season value of 1.27 in September.\nSummary: crop water requirements\n1. On an annual basis, the water-use of sugar cane is in the range 1100\u20131800 mm,\ndepending on location.\n2. Peak daily ETc rates of 6\u201315 mm d\u22121 have been reported.\n3. Different ways of calculating ETo, Eo or Epan will result in different Kc (or\nequivalent) values.\n4. The Penman-Monteith equation gives the best estimate of ETo.\n5. Evaporation from a USWB Class A pan can give a good approximation of this\nestimate of ETo (1:1).\n12 M . K . V. C A R R A N D J. W. K N OX\n6. The generally accepted values for the crop coefficient (Kc = ETc\/ETo) are as\nfollows: initial stage = 0.4 (depends on wetting interval); peak season = 1.25 (when\ncrop cover >80%); drying-off phase (if practised) = 0.75 (otherwise 1.25 continues).\n7. Lodging can reduce ETc by 30%.\nWAT E R P RO D U C T I V I T Y\nIn Hawaii, Chang et al. (1963) were amongst the first people to recognize the\nrelationship that existed between the ratios of actual to potential yield of sugar cane\nand actual to potential evapotranspiration, and to develop a general equation to\npredict yield.\nLater, in Natal, South Africa (ca. 30\u25e6S), the responses of sugar cane (cv. NCo376) to\na range of supplementary irrigation treatments on two soil types, sand and clay, were\ncompared (Thompson et al., 1967). The yield response to irrigation water applied was\nsimilar at both sites averaging 84 kg (ha mm)\u22121. Rain-fed crops grown on the sand\nextracted water from depths of 2 m, whilst those on the clay to only 1.2 m, reflecting\nthe relative differences in the depth of rooting on the two soils. On both soils there was\na linear relationship between the rate of increase in height of the cane and actual daily\nwater use. In three follow-up experiments on the same two soil types, Thompson and\nDe Robillard (1968) described a linear relationship between cane yield and \u2018effective\u2019\nwater application (rain plus irrigation, range 750\u20131800 mm, n = 14) with a slope of\n120 kg (ha mm)\u22121.\nData from irrigation experiments conducted across the world (Australia, Hawaii,\nMauritius as well as South Africa) were collated by Thompson (1976) and significant\nlinear relations between the yield of cane (Y, range = <100 to >300 t ha\u22121, fresh\nweight) and total water use (ET, range = <1000 to >3000 mm) were derived:\nY(\u00b115.1) = 0.0969ET \u2212 2.4(r = 0.95; n = 91)\nFor sucrose, the corresponding relationship was:\nY(\u00b13.43) = 0.0135ET \u2212 1.32(r = 0.75; n = 85)\nBased on their international experience, Yates and Taylor (1986) urged caution\nwhen using water use efficiency values alone to justify investment in supplementary\nirrigation in areas receiving 1200 mm or more rainfall. Other factors play a role\nin determining yield responses to water, including the depth of rooting, soil type,\nclimatic conditions and standards of management. An analysis of commercial yields\n(unirrigated) in upland Kenya, for both smallholders and estates gave water use\nefficiencies (based on estimated values of actual ETc) of only 50\u201360 kg (ha mm)\u22121, less\nthan the generally accepted realistic commercial value (100 kg (ha mm)\u22121) (Bull and\nGlasziou, 1976; Julien et al., 1989). An example was also given of how advection of\nhot, dry air on crop water use (in semi-arid Somalia) can reduce water use efficiencies.\nIn the FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper \u2018Yield response to water\u2019 (Doorenbos and\nKassam, 1979), typical \u2018water use efficiencies\u2019 for cane yield (80% moisture content)\nWater requirements of sugar cane 13\nwere presented as 50\u201380 kg (ha mm)\u22121 and for sucrose (dry) 6\u201310 kg (ha mm)\u22121.\nThese are both of the same orders of magnitude as those summarized here.\nSeveral researchers have looked at the effect of water stress at different stages of\ngrowth on yield. In semi-arid northeast Australia (20\u25e6S, 147\u25e6E), Robertson et al. (1999)\nreported (for cvs Q96 and Q117) that deficits imposed during tillering, although having\nlarge effects on leaf area, tillering and biomass production at the time, had no effect\non final yield, due in part to compensatory growth when watering began again. By\ncontrast, deficits imposed when the canopy was well established (leaf area index >2)\nreduced biomass and sugar production. Unfortunately, the levels of stress imposed\nwere not well defined so it is difficult to extrapolate these detailed findings to other\nsituations.\nIn a five-year field study in Texas (27\u25e6N, 98\u25e6W), Wiedenfeld (2000) found that\nwithholding (supplementary) irrigation during one of four individual six-week periods\nduring the grand-growth stage resulted in only relatively small reductions in cane or\nsugar yields, depending on the level of stress. The maximum yield loss, with no rain\nor irrigation for six weeks in mid-summer, was predicted to be 8\u201315% for cane yield\nand 12\u201319% for sugar. Yield responses to nitrogen fertilizer were not affected by the\nirrigation treatments.\nIn Swaziland, Ellis and Lankford (1990) suggested, on the basis of the results of a\none-year trial and previous work in Zimbabwe (Ellis et al., 1985), that water could be\nsaved by scheduling irrigation using an ETc\/Epan ratio of 0.8 rather than 1.0 during\nthe period of stem elongation, without loss of yield. This treatment, when combined\nwith no irrigation prior to rapid stem elongation and a drying-off period prior to\nharvest resulted in a water saving compared with local practices of about 20%.\nDoorenbos and Kassam (1979) identified four growth stages: establishment,\nvegetative, yield formation and ripening. The corresponding values for the \u2018yield\nresponse factor\u2019 (Ky), which is a measure of the relative sensitivity to drought or\nresponse to irrigation, were given as 0.75, 0.75, 0.5 and 0.1, respectively. For the\nwhole growing period Ky had a value of 1.2 (values of 1.0 or above imply sensitivity\nto water stress), which indicates a relative yield loss greater than any corresponding\nreduction in evapotranspiration. It is not explained how these values were derived\nand, following this review, it is not possible to verify them or to suggest alternatives.\nSummary: water productivity\nDespite difficulties in extrapolation, it is possible to come to the following broad\nconclusions from the information presented.\n1. There is a linear relationship between cane yield and actual evapotranspiration\n(ETc).\n2. The slope of this relationship (benchmark) is of the order of 100 kg (ha mm)\u22121, but\nvariable.\n3. The corresponding value for sucrose is about 13 kg (ha mm)\u22121.\n4. Water stress during tillering need not reduce final yields because of compensatory\ngrowth on re-watering.\n14 M . K . V. C A R R A N D J. W. K N OX\n5. Water stress during \u2018grand growth\u2019 does not necessarily lead to a large (>15%) loss\nin yield.\n6. Water can be withheld prior to harvest for periods equivalent to up to twice the\ntotal depth of available water in the root zone.\n7. Opportunities exist to reduce the depth of irrigation water applied without loss in\nyield, depending on soil type, at all growth stages.\n8. It is not possible to reconcile the FAO figures for the \u2018yield response factor\u2019 with\nthis information.\nI R R I G AT I O N S Y S T E M S\nThe choice of method for irrigating sugar cane depends on many factors that are site\nand context specific. The merits and limitations of different systems (not crop specific)\nhave been described by Jones et al. (1990) and Kay (1990) and for sugar cane cultivation\nby James (2004). This review is restricted to those irrigation systems evaluated on sugar\ncane and particularly the drivers forcing growers to switch technology to improve\nsystem performance and efficiency.\nFor many crops, including sugar cane, the capacity of a system to apply water\nuniformly and efficiently is a major factor influencing the agronomic and economic\nviability of production (Qureshi et al., 2001). But switching from traditional gravity-fed\nschemes to modern pressurized systems does not necessarily lead to better irrigation\nperformance unless the management skills and experience of the irrigator allow the\nequipment to be used effectively. For sugar cane, methods that are widely used include\nsurface (furrow) based systems, overhead (sprinklers, centre-pivots and rain-guns) and\nmicro (drip) irrigation.\nFurrow irrigation\nFurrow irrigation was favoured in many early sugar cane developments, due to its\nlow capital costs, suitability for land with gentle slopes and operational simplicity\n(Holden, 1998). However, rising costs for energy (pumping) and labour (furrow\nis labour intensive) has led to existing schemes in Swaziland being replaced with\noverhead or micro irrigation systems (Merry, 2003). There are also increasing concerns\nregarding the environmental impacts of large drainage flows and deep percolation\nlosses that can occur from furrow-irrigated fields (Mhlanga et al., 2006). For example,\nin north Queensland, Australia, the long-term use of furrow irrigation is reported\nto be contributing to a rise in the water table and an increase in salinity (Tilley and\nChapman, 1999).\nIn Burdekin, Australia, Qureshi et al. (2001) used a bio-economic modelling\napproach to assess the viability of switching from furrow to either centre pivot or drip\nirrigation. They concluded that furrow irrigation remains the most attractive option\nwhen water charges are low. Only when volumetric water charging is considered as a\npolicy option does centre pivot irrigation become the preferred option.\nWater requirements of sugar cane 15\nOverhead irrigation\nThe main overhead systems used for sugar cane are semi-permanent sprinklers and\ncentre pivots, and to a much lesser extent high pressure rain guns.\nSprinklers \u2013 drag-line: In drag-line irrigation a rotary impact sprinkler is attached\nto a riser and connected to a quick release valve via a flexible hose. Compared with\nconventional sprinkler systems with portable pipes, there are fewer pipe moves (as only\nthe hose and sprinkler are moved) with consequential labour savings, for a modest\nincrease in capital cost (installation of underground laterals). They are robust and\nflexible and can be designed to cope with most soil types, small and odd-shaped\nfields, obstructions and even different crops (ratoons) within one field. They are simple\nto operate and highly visible, making faults (blocked sprinklers) easy to identify and\nremedy (Merry, 2003). For these reasons, they have proved popular especially in\nsouthern Africa (Zadrazil, 1990). However, the system is susceptible to wind drift\n(particularly when the cane is young) as the sprinklers are mounted on tall (2.5 m)\nrisers to cope with irrigating a full cane canopy.\nCentre-pivots: In a number of regions including Africa, Brazil and Australia there has\nbeen a steady uptake in the use of centre-pivots in sugar cane. The reasons include\nlow running costs (compared to furrow), lower labour and energy requirements, ease\nof operation and the potential to achieve high application uniformities even under\nwindy conditions (Teeluck, 1997).\nAlthough originally adopted by the large-scale commercial growers, centre-pivots\nhave also proved popular with small-scale farmers in organized associations in\nSwaziland. The conversion from surface irrigated rectangular fields can create\nproblems dealing with field corners that then require a separate irrigation system,\nusually dragline sprinklers or drip. Centre-pivots can cope with undulating land and\nawkward field boundaries (e.g. drainage ditches), but a disadvantage is the relatively\nhigh capital cost whilst fields generally need to be at least 40 ha to make investment\nworthwhile.\nRain guns: Due to their robustness and versatility, high pressure, high volume\nsprinklers (rain guns) were widely used from the 1950s to irrigate sugar cane in\nMauritius, Zambia, South Africa, Swaziland and Australia. However, the large water\ndroplets can cause damage to young sugar cane and create capping problems on\nsensitive soils. Since 1990, however, rising energy costs coupled with increasing\ndemands for improved water application and crop uniformity have resulted in these\nsystems being replaced by drag-lines and centre-pivots (Teeluck, 1997).\nDrip irrigation\nWith drip irrigation small quantities of water are applied at frequent intervals\ndirectly to the soil. In Hawaii (USA), drip irrigation has been the principal method used\nto irrigate sugar cane since the 1970s (Koehler et al., 1982), whilst it has been evaluated\nelsewhere in the world. For example, Pollok et al. (1990) described the installation and\noperation of a fully-automated, commercial 40 ha drip irrigation scheme in Swaziland.\nAlthough this pioneering initiative was considered to be a success, such a sophisticated\n16 M . K . V. C A R R A N D J. W. K N OX\nsystem, it was judged, should only be contemplated where there are well-organized\nmanagement systems in place. Malfunctions of equipment and components require\nconstant monitoring and rectification as consequential crop losses are large. When\nwell managed, drip irrigation systems have the potential to achieve high (>90%)\napplication efficiencies (Tilley and Chapman, 1999), whilst there are also potential\nwater savings when compared with the losses associated with surface or overhead\nmethods. Research has concentrated on design issues that relate to the siting and\nspacing of the lateral pipes and drippers, quantifying the amount of water to apply\nrelative to other irrigation methods, and the amelioration of problem soils.\nIn a detailed experiment in Mauritius (20\u25e6S, 57\u00b4E; altitude 70 m asl) reported by\nBatchelor et al. (1990), a treatment with buried (0.2 m) sub-row drip lines out-yielded an\nalternate inter-row drip line treatment over three years (plant crop plus two ratoons,\ncv. Saipan). Applying water during tillering at 0.5ETc resulted in similar yields to\nthose obtained from applying more water at that time (1.0 or 1.5ETc). Despite a large\nnumber of supporting measurements, it is difficult to extrapolate the results, which are\nnot easy to interpret, beyond the locality where these experiments were conducted.\nMore roots grew in the inter-row areas when a drip irrigation emitter was present.\nDrip irrigation also altered the relative distribution of roots vertically compared with\na rain-fed crop (Soopramanien and Batchelor 1987, also described by Gregory, 1990).\nOn a poorly structured saline\/sodic soil in Swaziland (26\u25e6S, 32\u25e6E; altitude 200 m),\ndrip irrigation was compared with furrow irrigation to see if yields and the number of\nratoons could be increased (Dodsworth et al., 1990). In the plant crop, drip irrigation\ngave a small (7.5%) but non-significant yield benefit, but there was no advantage in\nthe first or second ratoon crops. Despite operational problems, there were significant\nimprovements each year in water-use efficiencies with drip irrigation (cane fresh\nweight, average 108 cf. 93 kg (ha mm)\u22121; +16%). Previously, Nixon and Workman\n(1987) had described the results of a field observation trial in which drip irrigation\nwas compared with furrow irrigation on a similar poorly draining saline\/sodic soil.\nAgain, there was no benefit from drip irrigation except in the plant crop and the\nfirst ratoon. Indeed, in later ratoons, there was a negative yield response as the soil\nstructure deteriorated further.\nFollowing a cost-benefit analysis of seven different irrigation options, a subsurface\ndrip system replaced ageing dragline sprinklers on a large commercial estate in\nSwaziland (Merry, 2003). A post-investment audit confirmed that there was a resultant\n15% sucrose yield increase and a water-saving of 22% compared to the sprinkler\nsystem. Although these increases were above those originally envisaged, there is a\nproblem in distinguishing the water saving due to better management from that due\nto the use of drip irrigation. Whether reported savings will persist once the drip system\nis no longer a closely monitored novelty remains to be seen.\nIn Mauritius, Ng Kee Kwong et al. (1999) showed how nitrogen fertilizer inputs\ncould be reduced with drip irrigation (fertigation). Similarly, a study in Australia found\nthat increased crop yields and sugar contents were possible, with a 25% reduction in\nnitrogen input relative to industry standards (Dart et al., 2000). Part of this gain arises\nfrom adjustments to nitrogen management to minimize the loss of nitrogen in wet\nWater requirements of sugar cane 17\nperiods, compared to other systems. However, high installation costs and problems\nassociated with rodents and low water quality causing iron deposits in the laterals\nremain major barriers to the adoption of drip irrigation.\nI R R I G AT I O N S C H E D U L I N G\nIrrigation scheduling is the process of deciding when to irrigate and how much water\nto apply. The objective is to maintain optimum soil water conditions for growth in\norder to meet yield and quality targets with the minimum amount of water.\nIn the introduction to a paper describing the results of a survey of sugar cane\nirrigators in South Africa, Olivier and Singels (2004) explained how irrigation\nschedules can be defined as fixed (amount and cycle are kept constant for the entire\ngrowing season), semi-fixed (amount and cycle are changed a few times to accommodate\nrainfall and significant seasonal and crop age induced changes in water demand) or\nflexible (amount and timing are changed daily or weekly according to a calculated water\nbalance based on recent crop and weather conditions).\nAlthough many approaches have been promoted over the years for sugar cane (and\nother crops), it remains the case that only a minority of farmers use an objective\n(scientific) method of scheduling irrigation, and most still rely solely on their judgment\nbased on intuition and\/or crop appearance.\nVisible symptoms of water stress include the following:\n\u2022 The lamina of the upper leaves curl inward reducing the exposed leaf area.\n\u2022 Young tillers roll their leaves before those on older stems.\n\u2022 Senescence of the lower leaves begins.\nIrrigation method constraints\nIn the four major irrigation areas in South Africa surveyed by Olivier and Singels\n(2004) scheduling practices were found to be highly dependent on the irrigation\nmethod being used. Drag-line systems were mainly operated on a semi-fixed schedule,\ndue to labour constraints and design limitations, with allowance being made for rainfall\nand seasonal effects (winter and summer) and to a lesser extent crop age. By contrast,\ncentre pivots and drip systems were mainly operated on a flexible schedule, with direct\nmeasurements of the soil water content (using a neutron probe) being the preferred\nmethod of assessment. Water budgeting using a water balance model was perceived as\nbeing \u2018too much trouble\u2019 in part due to lack of availability (at that time) of appropriate\ncrop coefficient values. It was recommended that attempts should be made to persuade\nusers of drag-line systems to change from fixed to semi-fixed scheduling, and users\nof centre pivots and drip systems to switch to flexible schedules. By so doing, it was\nestimated that the water-use efficiency of 18 000 ha of irrigated sugar cane in South\nAfrica could be improved. Although based on a relatively small sample size (40), these\nare interesting findings that are probably typical of many other areas of the world.\nThis is perhaps due in part to the fact that for many growers scheduling is perceived\nto be unnecessary since it simply reinforces their existing knowledge.\n18 M . K . V. C A R R A N D J. W. K N OX\nOlivier and Singels (2004) concluded from their study that the main barriers to\nthe uptake of objective irrigation scheduling techniques in South Africa were (i) the\ncomplexity of the technology and the difficulty of applying it in practice on a farm\nand (ii) the perception that accurate scheduling provides little benefit.\nLeaf\/stem extension\nIn theory, it is possible to exploit the sensitivity of leaf extension to water stress to\nschedule irrigation of sugar cane. In South Africa, Inman-Bamber (1995) monitored\ndiurnal changes in extension rates of the youngest visible leaf under different degrees of\nwater stress. At low stress levels leaf extension rates were above 2 mm h\u22121 throughout\nthe day, reaching 3\u20134 mm h\u22121 by early evening. Under moderate stress, daytime\nextension was minimal and was exceeded by night time growth. Under severe stress,\ndaytime extension was zero or negative (shrinkage), and at night it was reduced\nconsiderably. Recovery was very rapid (within a few days) on rewetting of the soil.\nIn Australia, relative shoot extension rate (RSER) is actually recommended as a\ncriterion for judging when to irrigate (RSER < 0.5), but farmers rarely have a control,\nwell-watered treatment for comparison (Inman-Bamber and Smith, 2005). It may\nbe possible, particularly under conditions of low evaporative demand, to reduce the\ncritical RSER value from 0.5 to 0.3 without loss of yield. If water is limiting, it was\nsuggested that irrigation could be delayed until leaf senescence began (Inman-Bamber,\n2004).\nShoot extension rate (SER) or leaf extension rate (LER) alone is confounded with\ntemperature effects, although an attempt to allow for this, by developing an index\nbased on a comparison of early morning and daytime LERs, has been proposed\n(Inman-Bamber and Spillman, 2002).\nNevertheless, the rate of stem elongation and final internode lengths are convenient\nways of assessing the effects of drought stress and, when compared with well-watered\nplants, provide a record of the timing, length and severity of a drought.\n\u2018Simple\u2019 scheduling aids\nTo address the problem of complexity, attempts have been made to develop \u2018simple\u2019\nscheduling aids. For example, a device based on the water balance approach was\npromoted in South Africa for sugar cane growers by George (1988). Using long-term\naverage evaporation data, and a measure of crop cover, together with an estimate of\nthe allowable soil water deficit, it provided a visual indication, using coloured pegs\nplaced in a \u2018pegboard\u2019, of when individual fields next needed to be irrigated.\nAgain with the same aim of simplicity, Torres (1998) described how, in Colombia,\na suitably calibrated cylindrical plastic bucket (0.3 m \u00d7 0.4 m deep) could be used to\nschedule irrigation of sugar cane. Based on a simple water balance, with a specified\nallowable depletion of the available water, it served as a visual aid of when to irrigate\nand how much water to apply. Its cheapness and simplicity made it appropriate for\nuse by smallholders.\nWater requirements of sugar cane 19\nTensiometers\nAt another level of complexity, Bell et al. (1990) used an array of tensiometers in\nMauritius for characterizing the soil water status beneath a drip-irrigated row crop.\nThis provided a means of describing numerically the soil water potential distribution\nwithin a given volume of soil to be used by designers, researchers and managers of\ncommercial plantations. It is not known if this approach has been applied in the ways\nsuggested, but Hodnett et al. (1990) compared a method of scheduling irrigation based\non this concept (using \u2018index\u2019 tensiometers) with the water balance method with some\nsuccess.\nAgain with drip-irrigated sugar cane, Wiedenfeld (2004) compared four different\nmethods of scheduling over three successive seasons in South Texas. Two were based\non a water balance approach (pan evaporation and ETo-Penman-Monteith), and two\non tensiometers (automatic and manual). All four methods were judged to be effective,\nalthough automatic tensiometers were found to be unreliable, with each prescribing\nsimilar quantities of water. The two water balance methods required crop coefficients\nappropriate to the location.\nSimulation models\nIn an excellent review, Lisson et al. (2005) compared and contrasted the two main\ndynamic sugar cane simulation models, APSIM-Sugar cane and CANEGRO, and\nhighlighted the role that modelling can\/could play in the management of sugar cane\nproduction systems. This included: irrigation scheduling, optimizing the allocation of\nlimited water supplies and assessing water storage options. Full details of the scientific\nbasis of CANEGRO can be found on the web through ICSM (2008). More recently,\nSingels et al. (2010) proposed ways in which the water uptake component of the model\ncould be improved.\nIrrigation scheduling services\nIn South Africa, Singels and Smith (2006) described an irrigation\nscheduling service consisting of a web-based simulation model, (CANESIM) (see\nhttp:\/\/sasex.sasa.org.za\/irricane\/index.htm) that estimates the recent, current and\nfuture water balance, crop status and yield from field information and real time\nweather data. The system automatically generates and distributes simple, user specific,\nirrigation advice by a \u2018short message service\u2019 direct to farmers\u2019 cellular phones. An\ninitial evaluation of the service on a small-scale sugar cane sprinkler irrigation scheme\nin South Africa indicated that, by following this advice, large reductions in water\napplied (33%) and deep drainage (64%) were possible. This was the result of reduced\nirrigation when the crop was young and during the winter months. Reliable feedback\nfrom the farmers was necessary for the service to be truly effective.\nRecently, a web-based irrigation management service has been introduced in\nQueensland, Australia. Known as WaterSense, it is designed to assist growers who\npractice supplementary irrigation in areas where rainfall is variable, where water\nabstractions are at risk from restrictions and whose sugar cane fields are at different\n20 M . K . V. C A R R A N D J. W. K N OX\nstages of development. It provides \u2018real time\u2019 advice on how to minimize yield losses\nwhen water is limited for individual fields (Haines et al., 2010; Inman-Bamber et\nal., 2008). Data from a network of automatic weather stations are used to calculate\nreference crop evapotranspiration whilst the APSIM-Sugar cane model simulates\ncanopy development and soil water processes. An irrigation schedule is derived and\naccessed on a dedicated web page on a centrally located server that stores the database\nfor participating growers.\nConclusions\nRobertson et al. (1997) used a systems modelling approach to evaluate the\nopportunities that existed for improving the use of limited water by sugar cane farmers\nwith case studies in Australia and South Africa. The importance of trying to ensure\nthat the maximum quantity of water (rain and irrigation) is stored in the root zone was\nemphasized, together with the problems of managing variability in the field. The paper\nquestioned the widespread use of a common value for the water use efficiency since it\npresupposes that it is relatively stable across production systems and environments (the\nAPSIM-Sugar cane model suggested that it could vary from 50 to 150 kg (ha mm)\u22121).\nThe authors agreed that concepts such as effective rainfall and water-use efficiency\nstill have a useful role to play as benchmarks against which to judge performance.\nMany approaches to irrigation scheduling have been proposed to suit all levels of\ncomplexity, but few are widely used by irrigators of sugar cane. This will probably\nremain the case until the availability and cost of water becomes a real constraint.\nUseful practical bulletins on the irrigation of sugar cane have been published amongst\nothers in South Africa (SASA, 1977) and in Australia (Holden, 1998).\nDrivers for change\nFor many row crops, including sugar cane, the adoption of modern water-saving\nirrigation technologies is often cited as key to increasing water-use efficiency while\nmaintaining current levels of production (Green et al., 1996). However, new technology\nrequires greater capital investment, so irrigators are often reluctant to adopt new\nsystems unless they can be convinced of the likely benefits. Where water costs are low,\nsugar cane growers have little incentive to switch technology to improve efficiency\nunless there are other externalities that might influence their ability to maximize\nnet crop return. But rising energy, labour and water costs, the need to increase\nwater productivity, less water available for abstraction due to expansion of cropped\nareas, increasing competition for limited resources, climate change risks (Knox et al.,\n2010) and demands for greater environmental protection are now the driving forces\ninfluencing technology choice in irrigated sugar cane production. In this context,\nbetter scheduling may prove to be a useful adaptation strategy.\nThe complexity of justifying a new investment in irrigation in areas where irrigation\nis supplementary to variable rainfall was demonstrated by Inman-Bamber et al. (1999).\nBasing their analysis on two case studies in Queensland, Australia, they compared\nmeasured yield responses to irrigation with simulated values using the APSIM-Sugar\nWater requirements of sugar cane 21\ncane model. They then predicted the likely benefits in cash terms of an investment in\ndifferent irrigation systems for a range of soils and scheduling options over a sequence\nof years. A positive return on an investment in supplementary irrigation was by no\nmeans a foregone conclusion despite favourable yield responses. Irrigation application\nefficiency was, for example, an important determinant of profitability.\nC O N C L U S I O N S\nFor irrigation of sugar cane to be sustainable, the issues of concern that still needed to\nbe addressed by the sugar industry (in Australia) were highlighted by Meyer (1997). Of\noverriding importance was drainage management for effluent control (excess water,\nsalts, agrochemicals and nutrients), the need to maximize water productivity and to\nlearn from history.\nBy contrast, in the conclusion to his review paper, Thompson (1976) argued that\n\u2018the degree of sophistication of irrigated sugar cane farming. . . is such that little will be gained from\nfurther research into the water requirements of the crop in the immediate future\u2019. Thirty-five years\nlater how justified was that statement?\nBased on this review, progress of generic importance since 1976 appears to have\nbeen made in the following areas:\n1. The sequential responses to drought have been quantified in terms of changes in\nleaf water potential.\n2. Mechanisms responsible for drought tolerance are better understood.\n3. Factors influencing the partitioning of dry matter and sucrose within the plant are\nbetter understood.\n4. Factors influencing root growth rates and distribution and soil water availability,\nare better understood.\n5. Ways of assessing crop water requirements, including realistic values of the crop\ncoefficient, have been ratified.\n6. Opportunities to save water by withholding irrigation at different growth stages\nhave been identified.\n7. Irrigation systems have been developed that allow water to be applied at the right\ntime with improved precision (but at a cost).\n8. New ways of scheduling irrigation have been developed and promoted but little\nevidence is yet available regarding levels of uptake.\nHow much of this knowledge has led to improvements in water management and\nincreases in water productivity is not known. Probably not enough! The \u2018drivers of\nchange\u2019 may not allow this state of affairs to continue much longer.\nAcknowledgements.
