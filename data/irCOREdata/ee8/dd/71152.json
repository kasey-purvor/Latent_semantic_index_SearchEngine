Observations by a 7\u00d77-beam imaging riometer\nin Kilpisja\u00a8rvi, Finland (\u223c66\u25e6 MLAT) of the drifting cos-\nmic noise absorption (CNA) structures in the morning sector\nnear the zonal drift reversals are presented. The examina-\ntion of the absorption intensity images revealed several re-\ngions with enhanced CNA (absorption patches) slowly drift-\ning through the riometer field of view (FoV). The absorption\npatches were found to vary in shape, orientation (for elon-\ngated arc-like patches), and drift direction. The latter was\ncalculated from the regression lines to positions of the ab-\nsorption maxima in the FoV images and compared with the\ndirection of electrojet plasma flow from horizontal magnetic\nperturbations and (for one event) tristatic ion drift velocities\nin the F-region. A reasonable agreement was found between\nthese directions both in point-by-point comparisons and in\nterms of direction reversal timings. The absorption patches\nof lower intensity appear to have smaller drift velocities and\nto be associated with weaker magnetic perturbations. These\nresults are consistent with the notion that relatively slow mo-\ntions of the auroral absorption near the zonal drift reversals\nare associated with the E\u00d7B drift of the entire magnetic flux\ntube as opposed to the gradient-curvature drift of energetic\nelectrons injected into the ionosphere at the substorm onset.\nThe absorption drift velocity magnitude, on the other hand,\nwas found to be substantially lower than that of the plasma\nflow based on the results of limited comparison with tristatic\nion drift measurements. A comparison of the drift directions\nwith those of the patch elongation showed that a consider-\nable number of patches had these directions close to each\nother. Using this observation, we demonstrate a satisfactory\nagreement between the patch drift velocities (both in direc-\ntion and magnitude) as determined from the absorption im-\nages and keograms under the assumption that some patches\nwere propagating in a direction that was significantly differ-\nent from the perpendicularity to elongation.\nKey words. Ionosphere (auroral ionosphere; electric fields\nand currents; plasma convection)\nCorrespondence to: R. A. Makarevitch\n(r. makarevitch@lancaster.ac.uk)\n1 Introduction\nThe spatial resolution of riometer systems has been gradually\nincreasing over the years of research from several hundred\n(widebeam riometer sets) to a few tens of kilometers (imag-\ning riometers), which has significantly extended the range of\ndetectable absorption structures and enabled more accurate\ndetermination of the cosmic noise absorption (CNA) drift ve-\nlocity (e.g. Hargreaves, 1970; Berkey et al., 1974; Nielsen,\n1980; Kikuchi et al., 1990; Stauning et al., 1995; Kainuma\net al., 2001; del Pozo et al., 2002, and references therein).\nBerkey et al. (1974), by considering a large number of syn-\noptic absorption maps from over 40 riometer stations in the\nsubauroral, auroral, and polar cap latitudes during substorm\nconditions, concluded that the absorption maxima in most\ncases moved eastward from the substorm injection area with\na velocity of 0.7\u20137 km\/s, consistent with the idea that the mo-\ntion of auroral particles injected during the substorm into the\nnightside ionosphere is governed by gradient-curvature (GC)\ndrift. Hargreaves (1970), using the absorption data from 4\nclosely-spaced riometers, found a significantly lower (from\n80 m\/s to 3.3 km\/s) range of velocities of eastward expan-\nsion with a significant number of absorption events expand-\ning westward. This casted doubt on the validity of a simple\ninjection-drift model and suggested that another mechanism\ncould be responsible for the observed drifts of absorption fea-\ntures. Hargreaves (1970) proposed that the precipitating elec-\ntrons are moving together with the entire magnetic flux tube\nand hence their motion is governed by the E\u00d7B drift or, in\nother words, by the high-latitude convection.\nLater Nielsen (1980) in a four-narrow-beam riometer ex-\nperiment in Northern Scandinavia studied the dynamics of\nabsorption spikes during the substorm expansion phase and\ndiscovered that the spike velocity appeared to be different\nfrom the E\u00d7B drift velocity. Moreover, a comparison with\nthe STARE radar measurements showed an almost ideal co-\nincidence over the observed range from 0.3 to 3.0 km\/s be-\ntween the spike velocity and the velocity of the STARE\nbackscatter poleward border.\n3462 R. A. Makarevitch et al.: Imaging riometer observations of drifting absorption patches\nMore recently, Kikuchi and Yamagishi (1990) and Kikuchi\net al. (1990), by employing the data from the scanning nar-\nrow beam riometer at the Syowa Antarctic station, showed\nthat the drift pattern of the elongated arc-like regions with\nenhanced absorption was similar to that of the ionospheric\nconvection, thus extending the result of Hargreaves (1970)\ntowards the smaller scales (30\u201360 km versus \u223c250 km in\nHargreaves, 1970). Using the imaging riometer in S\u00f8ndre\nStr\u00f8mfjord, Greenland and nearby magnetometers, Stauning\net al. (1995) investigated the dayside convection disturbances\naccompanied by the CNA enhancements and demonstrated\nthat the disturbances propagate poleward from the cusp lat-\nitudes across the polar cap with velocities of 0.4\u20130.9 km\/s.\nKainuma et al. (2001) gathered significant data statistics on\nthe velocity of auroral arc-like absorption regions from the\nimaging riometer in Poker Flat, Alaska with a beam sepa-\nration of 10\u201320 km. These authors concluded that the nar-\nrow absorption regions appeared to move with a velocity that\nwas consistent with the E\u00d7B drift. A similar conclusion\nwas also reached in several case studies that used the data\nfrom the Imaging Riometer for Ionospheric Studies (IRIS) in\nKilpisja\u00a8rvi, Finland (Nielsen and Honary, 2000; Kavanagh\net al., 2002; del Pozo et al., 2002). In the latter study, how-\never, it was demonstrated that this conclusion seemed to hold\nonly for relatively stable auroral arcs and that during the sub-\nstorm expansion phase the absorption drift velocity was sig-\nnificantly different from that of convection, as observed by\nthe European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) radar facility, a\nresult similar to that of Nielsen (1980).\nIn most of the above studies, including those that concen-\ntrated on the drift patterns of arc-like absorption structures\nutilizing large data statistics (Kikuchi et al., 1990; Kainuma\net al., 2001), the drift velocity was calculated under the as-\nsumption that the arc-like structures propagate in a direc-\ntion perpendicular to that of elongation, which reflects the\ndifficulty of determination of the velocity component along\nthe arc. Therefore, to complement previous studies and to\ntest the validity of this assumption we decided to exploit the\nimaging capability of the IRIS facility by using the absorp-\ntion field of view (FoV) images and in addition to the drift\nvelocity, to examine the shape of absorption patches. We de-\nveloped a simple method of absorption patch identification\nbased on the absorption images that does not require manual\nsifting through the data. In order to conclude on the mech-\nanisms governing the drift of auroral absorption patches, in\nthis study we concentrate on 10 events in the morning sector\nfeaturing a change in patch zonal velocity from eastward to\nwestward, thus exploring the absorption drifts in this transi-\ntional region.\n2 Observations\nThe IRIS facility in Kilpisja\u00a8rvi, Finland (69.1\u25e6N, 20.8\u25e6 E,\n\u223c66\u25e6 MLAT) became operational in September 1994. It\nrecords the cosmic noise absorption at 38.2 MHz in 49 differ-\nent directions with 1-s resolution, although some post-integ-\nration is usually employed to increase the signal-to-noise ra-\ntio (Browne et al., 1995). The bulk of CNA is due to pre-\ncipitating auroral electrons with the energies above 25 keV\nthat ionize the neutral atmosphere at D-region altitudes be-\nlow 95 km (del Pozo et al., 1997). IRIS is therefore capable\nof providing a continuous picture of the particle precipita-\ntion with good temporal resolution in 49 directions centered\naround the zenith beam. To facilitate the riometer data han-\ndling it is customary to combine the data from all 49 direc-\ntions in one absorption intensity FoV image using a grid in\ngeographical coordinates and interpolating the data. The ab-\nsorption keograms obtained by fixing the geographic longi-\ntude or latitude provide a simple method of visualising the\ndata. For more detailed analysis, however, the examination\nof the image series is preferable. More details on the imag-\ning riometer technique and methods of data processing can\nbe found in Detrick and Rosenberg (1990).\nTo put the motion of absorption features in the context of\nthe ionospheric currents in this study we used the magnetic\nfield data from the Kilpisja\u00a8rvi (KIL) fluxgate magnetome-\nter of the International Monitor for Auroral Geomagnetic Ef-\nfects (IMAGE) network (e.g. Lu\u00a8hr et al., 1998) co-located\nwith the IRIS facility. The IMAGE magnetometers measure\nthe north (X), east (Y ), and vertical (Z) components of mag-\nnetic field with 10-s resolution, from which the picture of\nelectrojet currents at E-region heights of 100\u2013110 km can be\nestimated.\nAs mentioned, in this study we decided to look at the peri-\nods in the morning sector of IRIS observations when the ab-\nsorption structures changed drift direction from eastward to\nwestward. In total, 10 events with 10 such reversals, as seen\nfrom the east-west keograms, were selected for the analy-\nsis, the criterion being that the event should show absorp-\ntion structures first propagating eastward and then westward.\nTable 1 shows the complete list of events; all times shown\nare in UT; MLT\u223c=UT+2.7. In addition to event start and end\ntime, Table 1 shows Kp indices (for the duration of event),\nIMF By and Bz GSM components in nT (typical for event)\nas measured by the ACE magnetic field instrument (Smith\net al., 1998), sunrise time, and drift reversal times from ab-\nsorption keograms. Note also that during event 2 two rever-\nsals were seen, first at \u223c06:33 UT (from east- to westward)\nand the opposite at \u223c08:00 UT. The magnetic activity was\nfrom weakly to moderately disturbed, whereas IMF condi-\ntions varied from event to event. In the following section\nthe riometer and magnetometer data from 14 February 2001\nare presented and discussed as a representative example of\nevents.\nFor this event the data on the ionospheric density, elec-\ntron and ion temperatures, and ion drift velocities from the\nEISCAT facility were also available. The EISCAT UHF\ntristatic incoherent radar system (\u223c928 MHz) consists of\nthree parabolic dish antennas with one site in Troms\u00f8 com-\nbining both transmitting and receiving capabilities, and two\nremote site receivers at Kiruna and Sodankyla\u00a8 (Rishbeth and\nWilliams, 1985). On 14 February 2001 EISCAT operated in\na CP-1 common mode with the Troms\u00f8 radar looking along\nR. A.

We\npresent the EISCAT measurements and derived ionospheric\nparameters in Sect. 5.\n3 Event on 14 February 2001\nFigure 1 shows the IRIS absorption intensity images from\n14 February 2001, 04:00\u201309:00 UT, in 1-min resolution (to\nmake the diagram readable only every other image is shown).\nFor each 1-min frame, the black dot indicates the absorption\nmaximum position inside the IRIS FoV. To obtain a smoother\nvariation of the absorption maximum position, a parabolic\nfunction was fitted to the point of maximum and two imme-\ndiate neighbors in the grid (both along x and y axes) and\nthe point of parabola maximum was taken as the absorption\nmaximum position. In addition to the black dot marking the\ncurrent fitted maximum position, up to four previous fitted\nmaximum positions are indicated in Fig. 1 by grey dots, the\nlightest being the absorption maximum of 4 min before the\ncurrent one. The coloured lines in each frame mark the half-\npower contours (absorption maximum minus minimum in\nthe FoV). The colour of the line is the same for each indi-\nvidual patch.\nWe defined the start and the end frames for each absorption\npatch as follows. We first considered if the maximum posi-\ntion changed from one 1-min frame to another by more than\n100 km (approximately 1\/2 of the FoV dimensions). This\nlimitation implies the largest drift velocity of 1667 m\/s to\nbe measured by tracing the absorption maximum, which is\nsufficient for events of interest with the observed velocities\nin the vicinity of drift reversals. If the jump in the absorp-\ntion maximum position was more than 100 km (we marked\nsuch frames in Fig. 1 by a big yellow letter J in the top left\ncorner of the frame), the frame count for a patch was reset.\nThe minimum \u201cduration of a patch\u201d (between jumps in max-\nimum) was taken to be 4 min (two frames in Fig. 1). The\nmaximum duration of the patch was limited by 20 min. We\nmarked in Fig. 1 the start and the end frame for each indi-\nvidual patch by letters B and E, respectively. Thus the start\nframe for patch 06 in Fig. 1 (the patch number is indicated in\nthe right bottom corner) coincides with the jump at 05:32 UT\nand the end frame is at 05:52 UT, 1 min before the next jump\nat 05:53 UT (the frame is skipped). One should note here that\nby restricting the maximum number of frames we artificially\nincreased the number of patches and that some successive\npatches are in fact the same patch (as, for example, patches\n07\u201310). However, in this way we are certain that our patch\nvelocity calculations (see below) refer to reasonably small\nperiods of time, so that the average velocity (for each indi-\nvidual patch) represents well the sense of the patch motion.\nThe latter is illustrated in Fig. 1 by the previous successive\npositions of the absorption intensity maximum (we marked\nthe previous positions only for the same patch). Thus, it is\nclear from Fig. 1 that, for example, patch 05 (green contour)\nwas drifting eastward. To emphasize this feature we indi-\ncated the average direction of the patch motion (for each in-\ndividual patch) in each frame of Fig. 1 by a blue straight line\nwith the origin in the absorption maximum (black dot). The\nmotion of the absorption maximum was not always simple\nand steady, that is along the average direction of drift, for ex-\nample, as for patch 15 (blue contour) for which the maximum\nfirst (08:06\u201308:08 UT) migrated eastward and then (08:10\u2013\n08:20 UT) drifted westward. We return to this issue in Sect. 4\nwhere we quantify the uncertainty in the patch drift velocity\ndetermination and restrict the database used for further anal-\nysis.\nAnother feature illustrated in Fig. 1 is the shape of the\nabsorption patch and its relationship with the patch drift\nvelocity. One can see in Fig. 1 a great variability in the\npatch shapes and directions of the longest dimension (for\nelongated patches), even within relatively short periods of\ntime. For example, patch 00 (blue) was elongated in the east-\nwest direction while successive patches 01 (yellow) and 02\n(green) were more diagonally-elongated. Patch 04 (yellow),\non the other hand, is clearly rotated by \u223c90\u25e6 with respect to\npatch 02. To quantify the size, shape, and orientation of the\n3464 R. A.

Sequence of the IRIS absorption intensity images at 1-min resolution for 14 February 2001, 04:00\u201309:00 UT. The scale for the\nabsorption is indicated on the right. For each frame the absorption maximum position is shown by the large black dot. Coloured contours\nrepresent the half-power contours for each individual patch with the patch number indicated in the right bottom corner of each image. The\nfour previous absorption maximum positions (for the same patch) are shown by grey dots, with the lightest dot being the maximum position\n4 min before the current one. The yellow letter J indicates whether a jump of more than 100 km has occurred in the absorption maximum\nlocation, and letters B and E indicate the start and the end frame of the individual patch, respectively. The short (long) straight black line with\nthe origin in the black dot shows the shortest (longest) distance between the absorption maximum and the half-power contour. The white\nstraight line indicates the average direction (for individual patches) of the patch\u2019s longest dimension in cases when the standard deviation in\nthis direction was less than 40\u25e6. The blue straight line shows the average motion direction (for each individual patch).\nabsorption patch we introduced the following two estimates.\nTwo black straight lines with the origin in the absorption\nmaximum in Fig. 1 show the longest and shortest distance be-\ntween the absorption maximum and half-power contour (ex-\ncluding the points at FoV borders). Although quite variable\neven for each individual patch, these estimates provide a use-\nful framework for studying the relationship between the ab-\nsorption patch orientation and drift direction. Figure 1 shows\nby white straight lines the direction of the patch\u2019s longest di-\nmension obtained by averaging these directions for all frames\nR. A.

The keogram\ngeographic longitude and latitude are indicated in (b) and (a), respectively, by the dash-dotted orange lines. The scale for the absorption\nis indicated on the right of panel (a). The black dots show the local maxima in time for the absorption. The dashed black lines represent\nthe initial guesses for the absorption patch movements, while the solid lines denote the best fits to all maxima located within 10 min of the\ninitial guesses. The maxima for each patch are marked by digits showing the patch number (from 00 to 07). The vertical dashed white line\nshows the reversal time of the patch motion direction (from eastward to westward). Panels (c) and (d) show the location of the absorption\nmaxima identified in Fig. 1 within the IRIS field of view. The maxima for each individual absorption patch are connected by the coloured\nlines with the correlation coefficients for each patch shown by red digits nearby. Panel (e) shows the 1X (1Y ) component of magnetic\nperturbations from KIL station at 1-min resolution by the heavy (light) black line. The days used for QDC calculations are indicated at the\nbottom of panel (e). The blue line represents the azimuth of electrojet plasma flow as inferred from the magnetometer data. The thickness of\nthe line corresponds to the magnitude of horizontal perturbations. The solid vertical lines denote the reversals in azimuth sign. Also shown in\npanel (e) by coloured horizontal lines are the azimuths of the absorption patch motion. The patch number from Fig. 1 is shown at the bottom\nof each line.\n3466 R. A. Makarevitch et al.: Imaging riometer observations of drifting absorption patches\nin a patch (longer black lines) if the standard deviation was\nless than 40\u25e6 (to increase the data statistics, for this averag-\ning we allowed up to 3 frames with the largest deviation to\nbe discarded). One can notice that this restricted estimate\nrepresents reasonably well the sense of the patch orientation\n(see, for example, patches 00, 08, 12). The angle between the\npatch drift velocity vector and the direction of the longest di-\nmension (blue and white straight lines, respectively) greatly\nvaries from patch to patch; if patch 04 drifts in the direction\nthat is more or less perpendicular to the patch elongation di-\nrection, for patch 15 this angle is closer to zero than to 90\u25e6.\nWith respect to the variation of the patch average drift di-\nrection (indicated in Fig. 1 by the blue line) with time, one\ncan see that during (roughly) the first half of the event (from\n04:00 to 06:30 UT) the absorption patches were drifting pre-\ndominantly eastward (with exception of patch 02). The first\npatch to drift westward after that was patch 11 (green) from\n07:08 to 07:26 UT. The next patch 12 drifted slightly east-\nward, but the next two long-duration patches (13 and 15)\nclearly drifted westward. To explore the time variation in\nmore detail we present the next diagram, Fig. 2, which shows\nthe same data as Fig. 1 but in a different format. Panels (a)\nand (b) are the absorption keograms at 20\u25e6 E (east of ge-\nographic north) and 69\u25e6 N, respectively. This geographic\nlongitude and latitude are indicated in panels (b) and (a),\nrespectively, by the dash-dotted horizontal lines. One can\nimmediately notice in Figs. 2a\u2013b several absorption patches\npropagating first, from 04:00 to \u223c07:30 UT, eastward and\nnorthward and then, after 07:30 UT, westward and south-\nward. The patch near 07:30 UT actually changed its drift\ndirection while being inside the IRIS FoV, so that the east-\nwest keogram (b) clearly shows the drift direction reversal\nat \u223c07:22 UT and we marked this time by the white dashed\nvertical line. Since this patch hardly reaches the central lon-\ngitude of the FoV (20.75\u25e6 E), for the north-south keogram\n(a) we selected a slightly more westward location to make\nthe reversal at 07:22 UT clearer.\nThe existence of the clearly defined patches in the ab-\nsorption keograms allows one to estimate the patch velocity,\nfor example, using the method described in some detail in\nKainuma et al. (2001), that is by fitting a straight line to the\nabsorption maxima for each patch. We first found all local\nabsorption maxima in time for each of the latitudes and lon-\ngitudes in panels (a) and (b), respectively. To restrict the\nnumber of such maxima the minimum period of time be-\ntween maxima was set to 10 min and the minimum height of\nthe maximum (with respect to adjacent minima in time) was\nset to 0.1 dB. The obtained maxima are shown in Figs. 2a\u2013b\nby black dots. We then assigned to each patch a start and\nend time; these times are connected in Figs. 2a\u2013b by dashed\nblack lines which thus represent the initial guesses for the re-\ngression lines. For the following least-square linear fitting,\nonly those local maxima that were located within 10 min of\nthe initial guesses were used. In this way, we avoided the\nnecessity to sift through all maxima manually for each patch,\nsetting instead only the start and end time for the patch. The\nlocal maxima that were selected for the fitting are shown by\nthe dots with digits that indicate the patch number and the fi-\nnal regression lines are shown by the solid black lines. Note\nthat the patch numbering scheme here is completely different\nfrom the one used in Fig. 1 (we have here 8 patches versus\n19).\nThe absorption patch velocity estimates from the\nkeograms are used later in Sect. 7 where we compare them\nwith velocities obtained using the primary method used in\nthis study described below. Panels (c) and (d) of Fig. 2 show\nthe geographic latitude and longitude, respectively, of the ab-\nsorption maximum location in the IRIS FoV versus time.\nThe maximum positions were determined from the absorp-\ntion images as discussed above (Fig. 1). The maxima for\neach individual patch are connected with the coloured lines;\nthe colour of the line is the same as the colour of the half-\npower contour in Fig. 1 (with the substitution of the yel-\nlow lines by the red ones, more appropriate for the diagram\ncolour scheme). To calculate the patch velocity we again fit-\nted straight lines (least-square fit) to the absorption maximum\npositions for each patch, separately for x and y components.\nThe linear regression coefficients for each patch are indicated\nin Figs. 2c\u2013d by the red digits. One should note here that\nthe drift velocity calculations are rather straightforward in\nthis method; the drift velocity from the regression lines gives\nthe \u201ctrue\u201d components of the absorption maximum velocity,\nwhile the drift velocity from the keograms gives only the ap-\nparent velocity that needs to be converted to the true patch\nvelocity, as discussed later in Sect. 7.\nThe direction (azimuth from the geographic north through\nthe geographic east) of the obtained patch drift velocity is\nshown in Fig. 2e by the coloured horizontal lines with the\npatch numbers indicated by the red digits. The thickness of\nthe line corresponds to the quality of the fitting: the heavier\nthe line, the higher the regression coefficient (minimum of\nthe two coefficients for x and y components).\nAlso shown in Fig. 2e are 1X and 1Y components of\nmagnetic perturbations (heavy and light black lines, respec-\ntively) recorded by the KIL magnetometer. The quiet day\ncurve was deduced from magnetometer records from the\nthree quiet days in February 2001, indicated in the bottom\npart of Fig. 2e. Assuming that the magnetic perturbations\nwere mainly caused by the convection-related Hall electro-\njet currents (Fukushima, 1976), the azimuth of the electrojet\nplasma flow (opposite to the current direction) was derived\nfrom the magnetometer data by rotating the direction of the\nhorizontal magnetic perturbations by 270\u25e6. This azimuth is\nplotted in Fig. 2e by the blue line whose thickness corre-\nsponds to the total magnitude of magnetic horizontal pertur-\nbations 1H=(1X2 +1Y 2)1\/2.\nOne can notice in Fig. 2e a reasonable agreement between\nthe directions of the absorption patch drift and electrojet flow\nderived from the magnetic perturbations. These directions\nare at \u223c90\u25e6, that is eastward during the first half of the pe-\nriod and at \u223c\u221290\u25e6 (westward) during the last 1.5 h with the\nvariable values in between. The agreement is better for the\npatches of sufficiently long duration (e.g. patches 00, 02\u2013\n08, 13, 15). The periods with not very good agreement (e.g.\nR. A.

In the next section we explore the\nrelationship between the absorption drifts and electrojet flow\nusing the data for all 10 events.\n4 Absorption patch drifts and electrojet flow\nIn Fig. 3 we compare (point-by-point) the azimuth of the ab-\nsorption patch drift with the average azimuth (for the patch\nduration) of electrojet flow for all considered events, Table 1.\nAltogether 225 absorption patches were identified using the\nmethod described in Sect. 3. To identify the parameter(s)\nthat might affect the quality of the absorption patch velocity\ndetermination, all points in Fig. 3 are colour-coded in (a) cor-\nrelation coefficient C=min(Cx, Cy), (b) the total magnitude\nof horizontal magnetic perturbations 1H , (c) patch duration\n1t , and (d) absorption intensity maximum A. As mentioned,\n1t was limited by 20 min. The maximum values for 1H\nand A were 850 nT and 5.3 dB, respectively, with the ma-\njority (>\u223c90%) of points having 1H<400 nT, A<2 dB. In\nthe correlation coefficient calculations we discarded one out-\nsider point to eliminate the effects of the sudden jumps (by\nless than 100 km) in the CNA maximum location with suc-\ncessive return to the original position that most likely did not\nrepresent the actual motion but rather a sudden, short-lived\n(1\u20132 min) CNA intensification at some other location within\nthe same patch, as, for example, at 04:46 UT in Figs. 1, 2c,\n2d. One can see that, similar to the previous section, there\nis a general agreement between the azimuths; the majority\nof points are within 45\u25e6 of the ideal coincidence line (we\nselected a \u00b1 45\u25e6 limit simply as a boundary between direc-\ntions that are closer to the plasma drift direction and the ones\nthat are closer to the perpendicular direction; these bound-\naries are shown by dash-dotted lines). Of the four param-\neters of interest, the points with greater C, 1t , and A tend\nto concentrate in the vicinity of the ideal coincidence line.\nTo emphasize this point, we show in panels (e)\u2013(h) with a\nheavy line the number of points above a certain threshold\nin the respective parameter with a relatively good agreement\n(\u00b145\u25e6 of the ideal coincidence) divided by the number of\nall points above the same threshold (in %). For reference\nwe also show with a thin line the percentage of points with\ngood agreement with respect to the total number (225). Thus,\nfor example, from panel (e), 50% of points with the correla-\ntion coefficient C between 0.5 and 1.0 have good agreement,\nwhile in total the points with C =0.5\u20131.0 and good agree-\nment constitute 25% of all 225 points. Clearly, the agreement\nimproves with the increase in C, 1t , and A, while it does not\nchange much with the 1H increase. We also notice that the\npercentage of points with larger 1H drops faster (thin line)\nthan in any other histogram. Having that in mind, for further\nanalysis we restricted the database of absorption patches by\n3468 R. A.

Panel (b) shows the scatter plot of the magnetic perturbations\n\u22121X versus zonal velocity of patch motion Vx .\nimposing the following criteria: Cmin\u22610.5, 1Hmin\u226130 nT,\nand 1tmin\u226110 min.\nFigure 4a shows the points that satisfy these new criteria.\nIn total, there are 46 absorption patches in the new database.\nOne can immediately notice that the agreement is indeed\nmuch better. The analysis analogous to that of Figs. 3e\u2013h\nshows that at least 70% of points are within 45\u25e6 of the ideal\ncoincidence line. The points with worst agreement tend to\nhave smaller absorption maximum values. In panel (b) we\nshow a similar scatter plot, the reversed north component of\nmagnetic perturbations \u22121X versus zonal component of the\npatch drift velocity Vx . The sign of the magnetic perturba-\ntions is opposite to that of the zonal component of drift ve-\nlocity (except for 4 points in the bottom-right and top-left\nquadrants). The points of the same sign are all located close\nto zero, both in terms of velocity and magnetic perturbations.\nThe points with small absorption tend to have small veloc-\nities and magnetic perturbations. The zonal velocities are\nnot high, with the typical values of the order of 150 m\/s for\nboth east- and westward drifts. Magnetic perturbations, on\nthe other hand, tend to be smaller in amplitude for westward\npropagating patches than for eastward drifting ones (50 nT\nversus 50\u2013200 nT).\nOne can conclude from Figs. 3, 4 that the absorption\npatches drift in the direction which is close to that of the elec-\ntrojet plasma flow derived from magnetic perturbations. If\nso, the absorption patches should reverse their drift direction\n(from eastward to westward) at the same time as the elec-\ntrojet flow does. In the example presented in Fig. 2 we saw\nthat this was approximately the case; from the keogram, the\nabsorption drift reversal was observed at 07:22 UT, close to\nthe reversal in magnetic azimuth at 07:16 UT (vertical solid\nline in Fig. 2e). The analysis of the absorption patch motion\nbased on the tracing of the absorption maximum in succes-\nsive locations confirmed this result; patch 10 (\u223c07:00 UT)\nwas drifting eastward, while patch 11 (\u223c07:15 UT) was drift-\ning westward. To assess how well the reversals in the riome-\nter and magnetometer data correspond to each other in all\n10 events we performed the following analysis.\nThe absorption drift direction reversals trev keo were iden-\ntified from the keograms for all 10 events (two for event 2);\n3 5 7 9\nUT\n-40\n-30\n-20\n-10\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\ndT\n, m\nin\n  2\n  2\n  3\n  4\n  5\n  6\n  7\n  8\n  9\n  10\na)\n10\n3 5 7 9\nUT\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  2\n  2\n  3\n  4\n  5\n  6\n  7\n  8\n  8\n  9\n  10\nb)\n11\nFig. 5.

Only the absorption patches of sufficiently\nlong duration 1tmin=7 min and high correlation coefficient\n(the highest of the two) Cmin=0.6 were considered here. The\nabsorption patch drift reversal time was then set to the mean\nof the start time of the first patch t1st and the end time of the\nsecond patch t2end , trev pat\u2261(t1st+t2end)\/2. The uncertainty in\nreversal time in this method was set to (t2end\u2212t1st )\/2. The re-\nversal time estimates calculated in this method were shown\nin Fig. 2e by the dotted vertical lines with the uncertainties\nshown by the dashed vertical lines.\nTo check that the two methods of reversal time calcu-\nlations (from the keograms and from the absorption im-\nages) give comparable results we plotted the time difference\ntrev keo\u2212trev pat versus trev keo in Fig. 5a. The uncertainty\nin trev keo was assumed to be zero for the present purpose.\nDigits near each point indicate the event number from Ta-\nble 1. There are 10 (out of 11 total) reversals trev keo that\nhave a corresponding reversal trev pat within 30 min. The\npoints are clustered evenly around the horizontal line of ideal\ncoincidence and only one point (7, marked by the diamond)\nis farther from the zero line than the estimate uncertainty.\nIn panel (b) we compare the reversal times from the mag-\nnetometer data trev magn (shown by solid vertical lines in\nFig. 2e) with the closest reversals trev pat (dotted lines in\nFig. 2e) by plotting the difference between those against\ntrev magn. Again, with the exception of event 1 all reversals in\nthe electrojet flow had corresponding reversals in absorption\npatch drift direction. Two reversals (both in magnetometer\nand riometer data) were identified for event 8, whereas only\nR. A.

Comparison of the IRIS absorption drift and EISCAT convection velocities in (a) azimuth and (b) magnitude. Blue lines show the\nabsorption drifts with the digits indicating the patch number from Fig. 2e. Diamonds connected with the thin lines correspond to the EISCAT\nion drift measurements at 2-min resolution simultaneous with the absorption patches from Figs. 1, 2e (the colour scheme is the same as in\nFig. 2e). Green horizontal lines show the average EISCAT ion drift velocities (for the patch duration).\none such reversal was identified in keogram. The overall\nagreement is satisfactory, with only two points located far-\nther from the zero line than the estimate uncertainty. A sim-\nilar result was obtained by plotting trev magn\u2212trev keo versus\ntrev keo (not presented here). One can conclude that within\nthe estimate uncertainty the reversals in the riometer absorp-\ntion drift direction were almost coincident with the reversals\nin the electrojet flow direction derived from magnetic pertur-\nbations.\n5 Ion drifts and ionospheric conductances from the\nEISCAT measurements\nIn the previous section we compared the absorption drift di-\nrections with those of the electrojet plasma flow derived from\nthe magnetic perturbations under an assumption that the lat-\nter are mainly produced by the Hall ionospheric currents and\nshowed that these directions were close to each other. A com-\nparison of the absorption drifts and Doppler velocities mea-\nsured by ionospheric radars such as CUTLASS (HF), STARE\n(VHF), and EISCAT (UHF) is another way of exploring the\nrelationship between the absorption drift and plasma convec-\ntion. Unfortunately, during none of the 10 events of interest\nthe HF\/VHF echo occurrence near the IRIS FoV was high\nenough to produce reliable convection velocity estimates.\nThe EISCAT tristatic ion drift velocity measurements from\nwhich the plasma convection velocity in the F-region (E\u00d7B\ndrift) can be inferred, were performed only during one event\n(14 February 2001) and in this section we present these data.\nOne should note, however, that the quality of the EISCAT\ndata during this event was not fully conducive for compar-\nisons with the IRIS-inferred drifts, e.g. for the exact zonal\ndrift reversal time determination, partly due to the technical\nproblem with remote site computers (the transmitter power\nwas not transmitted properly to the remote sites), resulting in\nminor measurement errors introduced during the data analy-\nsis for which a fixed value of the transmitter power had to be\nassumed.\nIn Fig. 6 we present the comparison between the IRIS and\nEISCAT horizontal velocities in (a) geographic azimuth and\n(b) magnitude for 14 February 2001, 04:00\u201309:00 UT. Blue\nlines represent the IRIS absorption patch drifts from Fig. 2e.\nThe digits nearby show the patch number. Diamonds show\nthe EISCAT horizontal velocities at 2-min resolution. The\naverage EISCAT velocities (for the patch duration) are shown\nby green lines and the EISCAT data points used for this av-\neraging (including points above the maximum velocity in\npanel (b)) are colour-coded according to the colour scheme\nof Fig. 2e. We have excluded all points with unrealistically\nhigh velocity VEISCAT>5 km\/s.\n3470 R. A. Makarevitch et al.: Imaging riometer observations of drifting absorption patches\nThe EISCAT convection velocity gradually changes its di-\nrection from eastward to westward, panel (a), although the\nscatter in the EISCAT data points is quite large (except for\nthe last 30 min). The reversal occurs between 06:30 and\n08:00 UT. The agreement between IRIS and EISCAT drift di-\nrection is quite good, especially for patches with higher cor-\nrelation coefficients 00, 04, 05, and 10 (shown as in Fig. 2e\nby thicker lines). Unfortunately, there is no simultaneous\nEISCAT data for the critical, westward drifting patch 15. The\nonly \u201cgood\u201d patch for which the difference in azimuths is\nabove 15\u25e6 is patch 03. We would like to point out, how-\never, that this large difference is almost entirely due to one\nblue point with negative azimuth of \u2212135\u25e6 at \u223c04:52 UT.\nThe agreement between velocity magnitudes is much worse,\npanel (b), with the IRIS drifts being significantly lower,\nthough one can notice that the EISCAT drifts decrease to-\nwards the middle of the interval of interest (06:00 UT), where\nthe IRIS drifts are minimized as well (patch 07) and that for\nthe intervals with smaller point scatter the disagreement is\nsmaller, too. The latter suggests that the relatively large dis-\nagreement between velocity magnitudes could be related to\nthe rapid fluctuations in the electric field intensity that are not\nseen through the imaging riometer technique but detected by\nincoherent radar as occasional high-velocity measurements,\nwhich, on average, result in larger EISCAT velocity magni-\ntudes.\nAnother issue that should be addressed in the context of\nthe EISCAT data is the relationship between the absorption\ndrift and ionospheric conductance. More specifically, we at-\ntempt to relate absorption to the height-integrated conduc-\ntivity and to assess the role that the conductance gradients\nmay play in the determination of the Hall current direction\nfrom equivalent currents. Indeed, even though inferring this\ndirection from the magnetometer records is rather a stan-\ndard technique (e.g. Stauning et al., 1995), its applicability\nmay be questionable when, for example, the electron den-\nsity\/conductivity distribution in the ionosphere is not homo-\ngeneous as discussed below.\nThe height-integrated horizontal ionospheric current J is\nrelated to the Pedersen (6P ) and Hall (6H ) conductances\nand electric field through Ohm\u2019s law:\nJ = 6PE +6H (b\u02c6 \u00d7 E) , (1)\nwhere b\u02c6\u2261B\/B is assumed to point downwards. The curl of\nthe toroidal (divergence-free) component of the current JT\nidentical with the equivalent current Jeq derived from mag-\nnetic perturbations is given by:\n\u2207 \u00d7 JT = \u2207 \u00d7 (6PE)+ \u2207 \u00d7 (6H b\u02c6 \u00d7 E) (2)\nand can be approximated as:\n\u2207 \u00d7 JT \u223c= \u22076P \u00d7 E + \u22076H \u00d7 (b\u02c6 \u00d7 E)+6H b\u02c6\u2207 \u00b7 E . (3)\nTo derive the real electrojet currents J from the mag-\nnetic perturbations one needs the information on the large-\nscale distribution of either ionospheric conductances (e.g.\nKamide et al., 1981) or electric fields from which the for-\nmer can be estimated (Inhester et al., 1992; Amm, 1995).\nSince the imaging riometer data from which the conduc-\ntance gradients can be inferred, was available only near the\nKIL magnetometer site and since the electric field distribu-\ntion (e.g. from coherent radars) information was not avail-\nable, we are not in a position to accurately compute the real\ncurrents. In addition, global techniques applied to the lo-\ncal problems often lead to large uncertainties (Murison et al.,\n1985; Knipp et al., 1994). We can nevertheless estimate the\neffects of the conductance gradients on the errors associated\nwith the assumption that the equivalent currents are equal\nto the Hall currents\/conductance homogeneity. Thus, from\nEq. (3), this error depends on the relative contribution of the\nfirst term as compared to the other two terms and hence on\nthe ratios \u22076P \/\u22076H and \u22076P \/6H . Under the assump-\ntion of the fixed ratio \u03b1\u22616H \/6P at any point, it follows that\n\u22076P \/\u22076H=1\/\u03b1 and \u22076P \/6H=1\/\u03b1\u22076H \/6H . Hence,\nwe should consider the relative gradient \u22076H \/6H .\nWe next present the EISCAT data and ionospheric char-\nacteristics derived from these measurements and model pa-\nrameters. Figure 7a shows the EISCAT electron density\ndata from 84.4 to 173.5 km on 14 February 2001, 04:00\u2013\n11:00 UT. The raw data from the Troms\u00f8 site have been\nanalyzed with a 2-min resolution using the alternating cod-\ning scheme. The minimal altitude of 84.4 km was selected,\nsince during the analysis it was found that the density data\nbelow the fully decoded altitude of 87.4 km (90-km range)\nexhibited regular changes that were consistent with the den-\nsity measurements above 87.4 km in at least one 3-km gate.\nThe EISCAT densities have been calibrated using the Troms\u00f8\nDynasonde data for the same period. The data points that\nhad negative densities or temperatures (not shown) have been\nexcluded from further analysis. Panels (b) and (c) show\nthe Pedersen and Hall conductivities, respectively, estimated\nfrom the EISCAT densities, electron temperatures and model\ncollision frequencies according to the standard formulas (e.g.\nKelley, 1989, p. 39). The collision frequencies have been\ncalculated by using the expressions given by Schunk and\nWalker (1973) and Schunk and Nagy (1978) and neutral at-\nmosphere density profiles given by the MSISE-90 thermo-\nspheric model for the time (14 February 2001, 06:00 and\n09:00 UT, for night- and daytime measurements, respec-\ntively) and location of measurements (IRIS FoV centre). The\nred dots in panels (b) and (c) are the height-integrated (84\u2013\n173 km) Pedersen (6P ) and Hall (6H ) conductivities in ar-\nbitrary scale. These values have been assigned to a spe-\ncific time only if the percentage of altitude ranges with den-\nsity\/temperature data was above 50%, so that the intervals\nwhen the EISCAT measurements were patchy (as, for exam-\nple, near 08:00 UT) have been excluded. Finally, the yellow\ncurves show the model height-integrated conductivities due\nto the sunlight (Robinson and Vondrak, 1984). The ratio be-\ntween Hall and Pedersen conductances \u03b1, panel (d), was of\nthe order of 3 for the entire period of interest. This ratio was\nslightly higher during the night.\nR. A.

The digits by each\npoint indicate the patch number, Figs. 1, 2e.\nto those 2-min intervals during which density is greatly\nreduced as compared to the intervals immediately before\nand after, as, for example, at 07:22 and 07:32 UT. In general,\nhowever, absorption A is correlated quite well with the Hall\nconductance due to the particle precipitation 6PartH .\nAssuming that a similar relationship exists also for any\nother point within the IRIS FoV, the effects of the con-\nductance gradients on the agreement between riometer- and\nmagnetometer-inferred drift directions can be estimated. We\nhave to remember, however, that consideration of the rela-\ntive gradients is more appropriate, as discussed above. Fig-\nure 7f shows the comparison between the relative gradi-\nent in absorption intensity 1A\/A at the IRIS FoV cen-\ntre and the difference between drift directions determined\nfrom riometer (Az Rio) and magnetometer (Az Magn) data.\nThe relative gradient in conductance due to the sunlight\n\u22076SunH \/6SunH is shown by the orange line. The average dif-\nferences 1Az\u2261|Az Rio\u2013Az Magn| taken from Fig. 2e are\nshown by horizontal blue lines and the average relative ab-\nsorption gradients (for the patch duration) are shown by black\nlines.\nThe relative gradients due to the sunlight \u22076SunH \/6SunH\nare small, except for the interval immediately af-\nter the sunrise (07:22 UT) and even then they are\nsmaller than the gradients associated with the parti-\ncle precipitation 1A\/A\u223c=\u22076PartH \/6PartH . The depen-\ndence \u22076H\n6H\n=F(\u22076SunH\n6SunH\n,\n\u22076PartH\n6PartH\n) is rather complex because\nof the nonlinear dependence of 6H upon 6SunH and\n6PartH but from Fig. 7f it can be approximated as\n\u22076H \/6H\u223c=\u22076PartH \/6PartH \u223c1A\/A for almost the entire\nperiod of interest. There is no clear relationship between the\naverage 1Az and 1A\/A, e.g. patches 03 and 04 are associ-\nated with the comparable 1A\/A (black) but 1Az (blue) is\nmuch larger for patch 04. One might think that a comparison\nof the average parameters is less meaningful in a situation\nwhen gradients at a fixed observational point exhibit high\nvariability, while the absorption drifts are estimated from the\ntracing of the absorption patches in the entire FoV and that a\nsimilar comparison on a smaller time scale could be more ap-\npropriate. To achieve this we computed the \u201cinstantaneous\u201d\ndifferences in azimuths in a manner similar to that described\nin Sect. 3, except that instead of considering the motion of the\nabsorption intensity maximum for long intervals (10\u201320 min)\nwe considered the motions for each 1 min of measurements.\nTo reduce the data scatter inevitable in such a crude method\nof velocity determination we discarded all 1-min intervals\nduring which the absorption maximum jumped by more than\n25 km. We show these instantaneous differences by green\ndots, Fig. 7f. Despite the difference in approach, one still\ncannot recognize any clear relationship between gradients\nand the difference in azimuths, except for the interval 05:00\u2013\n06:00 UT when the larger differences are associated with the\nlarger gradients. Interestingly enough, this was also the in-\nterval during which the absorption was highly correlated with\nthe Hall conductance, Fig. 7e.\n6 Absorption patch drifts and orientation\nIn Fig. 1 we presented an example of the absorption inten-\nsity images that showed a large variability in the absorption\npatch shape, orientation, and drift velocity. In this section\nwe further explore the relationship between the direction of\nabsorption patch drift and those of the patch\u2019s longest and\nshortest dimensions (determined as described in Sect. 3).\nIn Fig. 8a (8b) we have plotted the azimuth of the patch\u2019s\nlongest (shortest) dimension, \u201cAz a\u201d (\u201cAz b\u201d), versus az-\nimuth of the patch drift direction, \u201cAz Rio Pat\u201d. As before,\nwe limited the number of patches from 14 February 2001 us-\ning criteria Cmin=0.5, 1Hmin=30 nT, 1tmin=10 min. The\ndigits near each point in Fig. 8 indicate the patch number.\nFigure 8 also shows the standard deviations for azimuth of\nthe longest and shortest dimensions.\nIn case of the elongated region with enhanced absorption\npropagating in the direction perpendicular to the direction\nof elongation one would expect that the azimuths of the ab-\nsorption patch\u2019s longest dimension (Az a) would be located\nnear the lines that denote perpendicularity with the patch\ndrift direction (outer diagonal lines), while the azimuths of\nthe shortest dimension (Az b) would be located close to the\nideal coincidence line (solid diagonal line). Figure 8 con-\nfirms these expectations but only to a certain extent. Indeed,\nfrom Fig. 8b, the direction of the shortest dimension is very\nclose to the drift direction. In Fig. 8a, however, quite a few\npoints lie within \u00b145\u25e6 lines, that is closer to the drift vec-\ntor than to the perpendicular direction. The standard devia-\ntions for some points in both estimates, however, were quite\nlarge. To reduce uncertainties associated with these particu-\nlar estimates, for the next diagram we restricted the database\nto encompass only the points with standard deviations less\nthan 30\u25e6, Fig. 9. From the event on 14 February 2001 only\npoints 04 and 06 have sufficiently small deviations, so that in\nthis diagram we show the data from all events. In addition, to\nR. A.

The colour bar is shown in the top left corner of\npanel (a).\ncheck whether the absorption intensity has any effect on the\ndata in this presentation, all points in Fig. 9 are colour coded\nin absorption. Despite the limitations, the situation is quite\nsimilar to that of Fig. 8. The majority of points in Fig. 9b are\nlocated close to the ideal coincidence line, whereas there are\nat least 4 points in Fig. 9a with sufficiently small deviations\nto say for sure that they are also located close to the drift di-\nrection. Finally, there seems to be no consistent pattern in\nFig. 9 with respect to the absorption intensity.\n7 Absorption patch drifts from images and keograms\nIn Sect. 3 we described two methods of the absorption patch\nvelocity calculations, the first method is based on the trac-\ning of the absorption intensity maximum positions in the\nabsorption \u201csquare-shaped\u201d FoV images, deriving velocity\ncomponents from the regression lines, and constructing the\ntotal drift velocity vector as a simple vectorial sum of com-\nponents. An alternative way is to use the information from\nthe single row and column of the riometer beams (\u201ccross-\nshaped\u201d FoV), which is the case, for example, for presen-\ntation in the form of absorption keograms. In this method,\nhowever, the construction of the total drift velocity vector is\nnot so straightforward (see below) and in general requires\nmaking an assumption about the direction of the drift. More\nprecisely, an arc-like absorption enhancement is often as-\nsumed to propagate perpendicular to the direction of elon-\ngation. The data presented in this report, on the other hand,\nsuggest that this is not always the case (Figs. 1, 9a).\nIn Fig. 10 we illustrate the motion of an elongated patch\nand the patch velocity calculations, assuming an arbitrary\npatch drift direction with respect to the patch elongation. As\nthe patch drifts from the initial position, shown by dark grey\nellipse, to the final position (light grey ellipse), the successive\nnarrow riometer beams along the x and y axes would record\nthe passage of the absorption maximum through the beam,\nq\nd\nVd\nx\ny\nVax\nVay\nV V \/cosd a= d\nazd = p\/2-q+d\nVa\nFig. 10.

Using these values and\nassuming a certain rotation of the drift velocity vector from\nthe direction perpendicular to elongation (angle \u03b4 in Fig. 10)\nthe total patch velocity can be constructed as follows:\n\u03b8 = tan\u22121 Vax\nVay\n, Va = Vax cos \u03b8 , (4)\nazd = pi2 \u2212 \u03b8 + \u03b4, Vd = Va\/ cos \u03b4 , (5)\nwhere Va and \u03b8 (Vd and azd ) are the magnitude and direction\nof the apparent (true) drift velocity vector. Note that the an-\ngle \u03b8 is counted from the x axis counterclockwise, while the\ndrift azimuth azd is counted from the y axis in the clockwise\ndirection.\nThe second method (from the apparent motion in\nkeograms) is limited in a sense that the angle \u03b4 has to be\nassumed, whereas the first method (from the absorption im-\nages) can provide both the total velocity vector Vd and the\nangle \u03b4. It is, therefore, of particular interest to compare\nthe drift velocities obtained using these two methods. Fig-\nures 11a\u2013b show the result of such a comparison for (a)\ndrift azimuths and (b) drift magnitudes from 14 February\n2001, assuming \u03b4\u22610. The digits by each point indicate the\npatch number (in the numeration scheme of Figs. 1 and 2e).\nThe drift velocity from the absorption keograms (\u201cAz Rio\nKeo\u201d and Vkeo) was calculated for the closest (within 20 min)\n\u201ckeogram patch\u201d to those \u201cimage patches\u201d that satisfied the\ncriteria of Fig. 4. Thus, patches 03\u201307, 15 (Figs. 1, 2e) are\ncompared with patches 00\u201304, 07 in Figs. 2a\u2013b. The over-\nall agreement in Figs. 11a\u2013b is satisfactory. The points 05\nand 15 have the worst agreement, both in terms of azimuth\nand magnitude; for both patches the keogram method under-\nestimates the drift velocity. The reason for this underestima-\ntion can be the finite rotation of the drift velocity vector away\nfrom the perpendicularity with the patch elongation. Accord-\ning to Eq. (5), the drift velocity increases with \u03b4 as 1\/ cos \u03b4,\n3474 R. A.

The digits by each point indicate the patch\nnumber, Figs. 1, 2e. Panels (c) and (d) show the same comparison\nbut with the assumed additional rotation of the velocity vector for\npoints 05 and 15.\nso that one can introduce a necessary correction for velocity\nsimply by assuming some finite angle \u03b4. Figures 11c\u2013d show\nthe same comparison as Figs. 11a\u2013b, but with \u201ccorrection\u201d\nangles \u03b4=40\u25e6 and \u03b4=70\u25e6 for patches 05 and 15, respectively.\nOne can see a significantly better agreement both in magni-\ntude and azimuth of the drift velocity. The correction angles\nare in agreement with the data presented in Fig. 8a, in which\nthe average deviations from perpendicularity were 58\u25e6 and\n77\u25e6 for patches 05 and 15, respectively, with the uncertainties\nof \u223c40\u25e6. Thus, using velocities of the patch apparent mo-\ntion inferred from the keograms and by assuming that some\npatches were drifting in a direction that was different from\nperpendicularity to elongation, it is possible to reproduce the\nresults obtained from the absorption images.\n8 Summary and discussion\nIn this study we concentrated on the motions of the steadily\ndrifting absorption structures in the morning sector. For the\nanalysis we selected 10 events featuring the change in the\nzonal component of drift velocity from east- to westward.\nIn the past, zonally propagating absorption structures have\nbeen associated with the precipitating electrons injected into\nthe nightside ionosphere at substorm expansion phase onset.\nThe motion of electrons with energies in excess of 25 keV\n(required to produce a considerable absorption) is expected\nto be governed by the combined effect of the inhomogeneity\nand curvature of the geomagnetic field (GC drift) (Roed-\nerer, 1967, 1970). Experimentally, however, Berkey et al.\n(1974) demonstrated that, even though in most events the\nobserved velocities of the absorption eastward expansion of\n0.7\u20137 km\/s were close to velocities expected for the 50\u2013\n300 keV electrons, during some events the eastward expan-\nsion velocity was as high as 20 km\/s, which would require\nunrealistically high energies if the GC drift interpretation was\nto be used.\nIn our observations, the absorption drifts were much slow-\ner, with the typical zonal velocities of the order of 150 m\/s,\nFig. 4b. For these velocities to be associated with the GC\nmechanism the precipitating electrons should be very soft\n(\u03b5<10 keV) and hence very unlikely to cause a noticeable\nabsorption on the ground. A similar result was obtained in\nthe study by Hargreaves and Berry (1976), who reported\nthe median absorption peak eastward speeds of 38 km\/min\n(633 m\/s). In an earlier study by Hargreaves (1970) the range\nof reported speeds was wider (from 80 m\/s to 3.3 km\/s), but\nfor pre-midnight observations the drift direction was pre-\ndominantly westward, in sharp contrast with the gradient-\ncurvature hypothesis which implies eastward drifts for all\ntime sectors. The great variability in velocity in Hargreaves\n(1970) suggested that the absorption structures move with\nthe E\u00d7B rather than with the gradient-curvature drift. Later,\nKikuchi and Yamagishi (1990) and Kikuchi et al. (1990)\npresented evidence that the drift pattern of the small-scale\n(30\u201360 km in width) absorption structures was essentially the\nsame as the drift pattern derived by Hargreaves (1970) using\nriometers separated by \u223c250 km. Kikuchi et al. (1990) also\nnoticed a similarity between the absorption drift pattern and\nthat of magnetospheric convection, although the data statis-\ntics was relatively low (13 drift events). In this context the\nabsorption drift observations in various time sectors become\nof crucial importance. Kainuma et al. (2001) considered\n106 absorption drift events between 13:00 and 07:00 MLT\nand found a reasonable agreement between their results and\nthose of Hargreaves (1970) and Kikuchi et al. (1990).\nIn the present study we considered a comparable number\nof drift events (225 events without restrictions and 46 with re-\nstrictions, Sect. 4) in the morning sector (06:00\u201312:00 MLT)\nthe observations from which were poorly represented in the\nprevious studies. The auroral absorption drift observations\nfrom these magnetic local times are also important, since one\ncan expect the ionospheric convection to be reversed near\nmagnetic noon, so that one can check whether the sense of\nabsorption drift is reversed, too. Following this idea, instead\nof plotting the drift velocities for each individual drift event\nversus MLT in a statistical fashion similar to previous stud-\nies (Hargreaves, 1970; Kikuchi et al., 1990; Kainuma et al.,\n2001), we considered a series of drift events, thus monitor-\ning the absorption motions continuously, which allowed us\nto identify the reversal times. We would like to note here\nthat the present report appears to be the first example of con-\ntinuous observations of absorption drifts that showed a clear\nchange in the sense of zonal motions.\nR. A. Makarevitch et al.: Imaging riometer observations of drifting absorption patches 3475\nFurthermore, we compared the reversal times derived from\nthe absorption data with those of the electrojet plasma flow\nobtained from the magnetic perturbations and found a rea-\nsonable agreement, Fig. 5b. Another important observation\nis that the drift directions of the individual absorption patches\nagree well with those of the electrojet plasma flow, Fig. 4a.\nThese two results were in agreement with the results of com-\nparison between absorption patch drift and EISCAT plasma\nconvection velocities based on the limited data set, Fig. 6.\nAll of the above leads us to conclude that the absorption\nstructures in our observations were drifting with the veloc-\nities consistent with the E\u00d7B drift mechanism.\nThis result disagrees with those of Nielsen (1980) and del\nPozo et al. (2002), who presented several examples demon-\nstrating a significant difference between the absorption and\nE\u00d7B drift velocities, but one has to keep in mind that their\nobservations were performed near magnetic midnight during\nthe substorm expansion phase, while ours refer to a different\nMLT sector, for which the E\u00d7B drift mechanism seems to be\ndominating (Kavanagh et al., 2002).\nThe question remains, however, why the precipitating\nelectrons that have sufficiently high energy (\u03b5>25 keV) to be\ndetected by riometers on the ground, drift with much slower\nvelocity than the one implied by the trapped particle the-\nory. Kikuchi et al. (1990) suggested that the hot plasma\ncloud injected into the region of closed field lines from the\nmagnetotail at the substorm onset propagates with the GC\ndrift until it encounters another plasma cloud populated with\ncolder particles. This results in the pitch-angle scattering of\nthe high-energy electrons into the loss cone with the suc-\ncessive precipitation at the D-region altitudes. In this sce-\nnario, even though the precipitating electrons still have suf-\nficiently high energy to cause considerable absorption, the\nregion where the actual precipitation occurs is essentially an\nionospheric projection of the \u201cintersection\u201d between hot and\ncold plasma clouds and hence its motion is controlled by that\nof the slower, cold particles.\nA condition for the electrons to propagate with the velocity\nclose to that of the E\u00d7B drift can be readily obtained from\nthe expression for the electron drift velocity (e.g. Roederer,\n1970):\nVD = E\nB\ni + \u03b5\nBRc\n(1 + cos2 \u03b1)j , (6)\nwhere i and j are the unit vectors directed along the E\u00d7B\nand GC drift directions, respectively, \u03b5 is the energy in eV,\nRc is the magnetic field line radius of curvature, and \u03b1 is\nthe pitch angle. For a dipolar field, Rc=LRE\/3, where RE\nis the Earth\u2019s radius, and hence the ratio between the sec-\nond (GC) and the first (E\u00d7B ) term magnitudes in Eq. (6) is\n3(1+ cos2 \u03b1)\/(LRE)\u03b5\/E. For electrons with \u03b1=0 at L=6\nthis becomes \u223c1\/6\u03b5\/E if \u03b5 and E are expressed in keV and\nmV\/m, respectively. For a radial magnetospheric electric\nfield ERM=1 mV\/m, resulting in a meridional ionospheric\nelectric field EMI=2L(L\u22123\/4)1\/2ERM (Mozer, 1970) of\n27.5 mV\/m, this implies \u03b5<6 keV for the E\u00d7B drift to dom-\ninate over the GC drift.\nIn this interpretation the drift velocity is determined by the\nelectric field. The low drift velocity magnitudes reported in\nthis study are then almost for certain related to the fact that\nthe observations were performed near the zonal flow rever-\nsals, where velocity is close to zero. Unlike the drift veloc-\nities, the magnetic perturbations associated with the absorp-\ntion enhancements were not symmetric with respect to the\ndrift reversal. Thus, we noticed in Fig. 4b a certain asym-\nmetry between the magnitudes of 1X for positive and nega-\ntive 1X corresponding to the westward and eastward plasma\nflows, respectively. Interestingly, a similar feature can be rec-\nognized in the data presented by Kikuchi et al. (1990) (see\ntheir Fig. 7), although with faster zonal velocities observed\n(from \u2212500 to +800 m\/s). The fact that in Fig. 4b the points\nwith the lowest Vx and 1X had the smallest absorption in-\ntensity can be interpreted as follows. While Vx is a measure\nof the electric field, the auroral absorption is related to the\nionospheric plasma density. The magnetic perturbations, in\nturn, are the measure of the electrojet current, which is the\nfunction of both electric field and conductivity\/plasma den-\nsity. In the case when both electric field and density are small\nthe magnetic perturbations are expected to be small, too, con-\nsistent with the data presented in Fig. 4b.\nThe problem with this interpretation is that an increase in\nthe ionospheric conductivity associated with the enhanced\nabsorption typically occurs at D-region altitudes around\n90 km, which is somewhat lower than the typical electrojet\nheight of 110 km. With the electron energy decrease, how-\never, the height where most of the ionization takes place in-\ncreases (e.g. Rees, 1964), and although it is generally true\nthat the corresponding absorption decreases drastically, the\nabsorption events of low intensity (say, below 0.5 dB) could\nbe related to the plasma density increase at 95\u2013100 km alti-\ntudes. Rocket measurements showed that the height of ab-\nsorption maximum at night can be from 90 to 95 km with\nthe half-power width of absorption peak of the order of\n20 km (see, for example, a comprehensive review by Har-\ngreaves, 1969, and references therein). Certainly, the issue\nabout the height of absorption maximum is far from being\nresolved. With the construction of two new imaging riome-\nters in And\u00f8ya (IRIS-AND) and Ramfjordmoen (ARIES) in\nNorway located close to the IRIS FoV it will be possible to\ndetermine the altitude of the principle absorption layer more\nprecisely. The results of a similar experiment in Antarc-\ntica based on the simple vertical parallax technique showed\nthat \u223c50% of all (low- and high-intensity) CNA events are\npeaked above 90 km, with the median peak at 92.5 km (Terk-\nildsen et al., 2004). How this altitude varies for different\nlevels of CNA remains to be seen.\nThe EISCAT density data presented in Fig. 7a for an event\non 14 February 2001 support the idea that the absorption\nenhancements were produced by the particles precipitating\nsomewhat above the nominal absorption altitude of 90 km.\nThe density was maximized at around 105 km in the begin-\nning of the period of interest, 04:00\u201305:00 UT and at\u223c95 km\nlater, at around 05:30, 06:30, and 07:30 UT. This observa-\ntion can partially explain the large discrepancies between\n3476 R. A. Makarevitch et al.: Imaging riometer observations of drifting absorption patches\nthe EISCAT convection and IRIS drift velocity magnitudes\nsimply because in the IRIS drift velocity calculations we as-\nsumed a height of 90 km. The correction (ratio of maximum\nheight to 90 km) is larger in the beginning of the period, in\nagreement with the data presented in Fig. 6b, in which the\nratio between EISCAT and IRIS velocity magnitudes was\nlarger for this interval as well (04:00\u201305:00 UT). If one as-\nsumes a height of 105 km, as suggested by the EISCAT den-\nsity data for this interval, the correction is \u223c 105\/90\u223c=1.17,\nwhich is still considerably less than the correction required to\nmatch the EISCAT- and IRIS-inferred drift magnitudes. The\nrapid fluctuations in the electric field intensity not detectable\nthrough the imaging riometer technique discussed in Sect. 5\ncould be the cause for the remaining part of the discrepan-\ncies. Another potential reason are the effects of the elec-\ntric field spatial microstructure which are more pronounced\nfor the smaller viewing area of the EISCAT radar. A similar\nconclusion has been reached by Davies et al. (1999), who re-\nported greater EISCAT velocities as compared to those mea-\nsured by the CUTLASS HF radar.\nAn alternative view is that significant discrepancies be-\ntween the EISCAT- and IRIS-inferred drifts stem from the\nfact that the absorption patches do drift with the velocity,\nwhich is significantly different from that of the ambient\nplasma. Such examples have been presented in the past for\nthe case of dynamic structures during the substorm condi-\ntions observed with riometers (Nielsen, 1980; del Pozo et al.,\n2002), as well as with optical instruments and magnetome-\nters (e.g. Lu\u00a8hr et al., 1998). The limited amount of the plasma\nflow speed measurements available for comparison with ab-\nsorption drift estimates of sufficient quality (high regression\ncoefficients and long duration) prevents us from making a\nmore definite conclusion as to whether absorption drifts are\nsystematically lower than the E\u00d7B drift in velocity magni-\ntude in the vicinity of the morning zonal drift reversals. Our\nresults, showing reasonable agreement between absorption\ndrift and plasma flow directions, on the other hand, support\nthe E\u00d7B mechanism idea. Further comparisons between the\nabsorption drift estimates from IRIS and plasma flow mea-\nsurements from such facilities as EISCAT and CUTLASS\nin other time sectors should help resolve the issue. An-\nother point requiring further investigation is the identification\nof the mechanism(s) associated with the absorption patches\ndrifting with a velocity distinctly different from that of the\nambient plasma.\nThe EISCAT density and electron temperature data on\n14 February 2001 (together with the MSISE-90 neutral den-\nsities) have also been employed to compute the Pedersen and\nHall conductances, Figs. 7b, c. The latter has been shown\nto correlate well with the absorption intensity in beam 16\nof IRIS, the beam closest to that of EISCAT, which allowed\nus to estimate the effect of the conductance gradients on the\ndifference between the electrojet flow direction (opposite to\nequivalent current) and that of the IRIS-inferred drifts. We\nfound that the correlation between those two parameters was\nrather poor, Fig. 7f. In addition, the analysis similar to that\nperformed in Fig. 3 for 1A\/A as a parameter showed almost\nno dependence of the difference between azimuths from the\nrelative absorption gradients. One should bear in mind, how-\never, that in our analysis we considered the relative gradient\nmagnitudes and that a more sophisticated approach which\nwould take into account additional parameter(s), such as rela-\ntive orientation of the gradient and electric field (the informa-\ntion on which was not available in this study), might reveal\nthe desired effect.\nAnother important result of this study is on the relation-\nship between the absorption drift direction and the direction\nof the patch elongation. We demonstrated that, although\nmost patches drifted in a direction close to perpendicular-\nity with elongation, in agreement with the previous findings\nby Kikuchi et al. (1990) and Kainuma et al. (2001), a con-\nsiderable number of patches in our observations drifted in a\ndirection that was closer to that of elongation, Figs. 8, 9. We\nalso compared the drift velocities obtained using the primary\nmethod adopted for this study, the tracing of the absorption\nintensity maximum locations in the absorption FoV images,\nwith those obtained in a second, more traditional method,\nthat is from the absorption keogram, and found overall agree-\nment. For the absorption patches for which the agreement\nwas the worst we introduced an additional rotation of the drift\ndirection (which has to be assumed in the second method)\naway from the perpendicularity, with the patch elongation\nconsistent with the estimates from Fig. 8 and showed a sub-\nstantial improvement in agreement between the two methods,\nFig. 11.\nIn this study we developed a simple method for absorption\npatch identification based on the tracing of the absorption in-\ntensity maximum positions inside the IRIS FoV, which, com-\nbined with the half-power contour information, provides a\nuseful tool for studying fine features in the particle precipita-\ntion. Although we restricted the maximum number of frames\nfor each patch (mainly to increase the reliability of the ve-\nlocity estimates), thus artificially \u201cmultiplying\u201d the number\nof patches, the application of the same procedure in the ab-\nsence of such a limitation allows one to identify the absorp-\ntion patches quite uniquely, so that instead of patches 07\u2013\n10 in Fig. 1 there will be just one patch corresponding to\npatch 04 in Figs. 2a\u2013b. The method does not require vast\ncomputational resources, nor does it involve excessive man-\nual sifting through the data. In this method though the same\npatch reentering the FoV after the drift reversal would be\nclassified as a separate patch since the IRIS FoV is relatively\nsmall (\u223c200\u00d7200 km2), which makes it difficult to verify\nwhether the reentering patch is indeed the same (e.g. by us-\ning the information on patch size\/shape). Ideally, one would\nwant to trace the absorption patches in much larger areas of\nthe ionosphere, i.e. comparable to the all-sky-camera FoV\n(\u223c1000 km in diameter). The new imaging riometers under\nconstruction, IRIS-AND and ARIES, should rectify this sit-\nuation, enabling the restoration of the particle precipitation\npicture on a larger scale without compromising the good spa-\ntial resolution.\nR. A. Makarevitch et al.: Imaging riometer observations of drifting absorption patches 3477\n9 Conclusion\nThe first continuous observations of the drifting structures in\nauroral absorption in the morning sector near the zonal drift\nreversals presented in this report showed that the regions with\nenhanced absorption were drifting in a direction that was\nclose to that of the electrojet plasma flow derived from hor-\nizontal magnetic perturbations and (for one event) tristatic\nion drift velocities in the F-region. The drifting structures\nchanged the direction of their motion from eastward to west-\nward at approximately the same time as the plasma convec-\ntion. Based on our results on the absorption drift direction,\nwe consider the E\u00d7B drift to be the primary mechanism that\ndetermines the absorption drift velocity in the auroral zone\nin the morning sector, although more studies are needed to\ndetermine whether the absorption drift velocity magnitude is\nconsistent with this mechanism. The present work based on\nthe continuous observations of the absorption motions thus\nextends conclusions drawn from the previous observations\nof individual absorption drift events to the crucial region in\nthe vicinity of the zonal drift reversals.\nIn this study we performed comparisons between the di-\nrections of the absorption drift with those of the absorption\npatch elongation obtained from the absorption intensity 7\u00d77-\nbeam images. These confirmed a general validity of the as-\nsumption about their perpendicularity, but also demonstrated\na substantial deviation of the drift direction away from the\nperpendicularity with elongation in a number of cases, re-\nsulting in an underestimation of the patch velocity derived\nby tracing the absorption maximum in the single row-column\nof the riometer beams (e.g. from the absorption keograms).\nOur results suggest that the variability in the absorption patch\nshape, elongation, and drift direction is significantly larger\nthan it was previously thought to be.\nAcknowledgements.
