Research\nresults have proved that over 70 per cent of the pro-\nduction costs of a product are determined during the\nconceptual design stage [1, 2]. In addition, assembly\ncost often accounts for over 40 per cent of the total\nmanufacturing cost [3\u20136]. Therefore, it is essential\nto take into consideration all the requirements of\nassembly during the early design stages, otherwise\nadditional cost and time to redesign already finished\ndesigns is inevitable. In addition, specifically assem-\nbly automation and robotic assembly are highly\nspecialized fields. Furthermore, most designer\nengineers do not normally have the necessary\nknowledge to meet all requirements to achieve a\ngood design from the assembly point of view [7].\nTherefore, they need an efficient tool to support\nthem during the design process and to overcome\nthe above limitation. Naturally, there are some over-\nlapping considerations in the two major design for\nautomation (DFA) categories, namely design for\nmanual and design for automated assembly. How-\never, in product design requirements, manual\nassembly differs widely from automatic or robot\nassembly owing to the differences in ability between\nhuman operators and any automatic method of\nassembly. An operation that is easy for an assembly\nworker to perform might be impossible for a robot\nor special-purpose workhead [8].\nTo date, a significant amount of research work has\nbeen achieved on various issues of design for assem-\nbly, such as product and process design methodolo-\ngies [9], assemblability analysis and evaluation [10],\nautomated assembly of specific components [11],\ndetailed analysis of assembly operations [12, 13],\nautomated sequence planning [7, 14, 15], joining\nprocesses and related technology [16, 17], computer\n*Corresponding author: Enterprise Integration, SIMS, Cran-\nfield University, Building 53, Cranfield, Bedford MK43 0AL,\nUK. email: e.shehab@cranfield.ac.uk\nJEM298 \u0001 IMechE 2006 Proc. IMechE Vol. 220 Part B: J. Engineering Manufacture\n1\nsimulation of assembly process [18], etc. However,\nthe most well-known DFA methods are those of\nBoothroyd and Dewhurst [8] and the assemblability\nevaluation method (AEM) by Hitachi [10]. The draw-\nback of the former technique is that the product ana-\nlysis is complicated and quite time-consuming,\ndespite available personal computer (PC) programs.\nFurthermore the technique depends only on the\nfunctional analysis of the product, without taking\ninto consideration the manufacturing cost of com-\nplex components. Clearly, the cost of complex com-\nponents could possibly erode any advantage gained\nin reduction of assembly costs. AEM by Hitachi [10]\nis suitable for typical mass products, such as tape\nrecords or vacuum cleaners. Shortcomings of this\napproach are that the costs for component handling\nand orienting are not considered and that the esti-\nmation of the actual assembly costs is uncertain.\nFurther details about the reviews on the different\naspects of design for assembly can be found in refer-\nences [12, 19, 20].\nMuch effort has been done on the development\nof DFA knowledge-based expert systems [3, 13,\n21\u201325]. In general, these systems consist of a design\ntool computer-aided-design (CAD), a knowledge-\nacquisition and storage tool, and an inference\nengine. The famous knowledge-based design for\nassembly systems was developed by Lucas Engin-\neering [21]. This system is the most advanced in\ndesign for the assembly process, yet not necessarily\nthe most effective in reducing assembly cost. It com-\nprises the definition of an assembly sequence and\nthe analysis of each component and its liaison for\nease of handling and fitting. This results in handling\nand fitting indices. It also takes account of avail-\nability of gripping surfaces. Zha et al. described\nin a number of papers [3, 22, 24] the develop-\nment process of a knowledge-based approach to\nsupport top\u2013down design for assembled products\n[3, 22] and an agent-based expert system for concur-\nrent product design and assembly planning [24].\nThe proposed intelligent approach and framework\n[3, 22] focused on the knowledge-based integration\nof product design, assemblability analysis and eva-\nluation, and design for assembly with economical\nanalysis. An intelligent system for product design\nfor assembly within a concurrent engineering envir-\nonment has been presented by Daabub and Abdalla\n[23]. Moreover, their system enables designers to\nminimize the number of components of a product\nand select the assembly method for that specific\nproduct. The general rules and guidelines of DFA\nmethods accompanied by illustrated examples can\nbe found in reference [26].\nA review of available literature indicates that, so\nfar, little research work has been done on product\ndesign for assembly automation at an early stage of\nthe design process. In particular, suggestions for\nproduct re-designs improvement for easy robotic\nassembly operation, without any compromise of\nthe product\u2019s functionality, have received less atten-\ntion from researchers. In addition, the previous sys-\ntems are carried out on a completed product\ndesign. At that stage of design the necessary rede-\nsigning is very expensive and the lead time of the\nproduct is increased. Additionally, these techniques\nrelied on asking the designers, who lack the neces-\nsary design for assembly knowledge, to answer a set\nof questions regarding the functionality and the var-\nious parts of the product.\nThe present paper presents details of the develop-\nment of an intelligent knowledge-based system\n(KBS) for design for automation to overcome the\nabove shortcomings. However, the current system\nis a further development of a design to cost system\nthat has been developed by the current authors [1,\n27\u201329]. The major achievement of the latest version\nof the developed system is that it unified the product\ncost modelling and design for assembly automation\ninto an integrated system. Therefore, the main\nobjectives of this new version of the developed sys-\ntem are to: (a) estimate the assembly cost; (b) select\nthe most economic assembly technique for the\nproduct at an early design stage; and (c) analyse\nthe product design for automation and provide the\ndesigners with design improvement recommenda-\ntions to simplify assembly operations, based on a\ndesign feasibility technique.\n2 SYSTEM FRAMEWORK\nThe system framework for design for assembly com-\nprises a knowledge-based reasoning system, a CAD\nsystem, a design analysis for robotic assembly mod-\nule, a design improvement suggestion module, and a\nuser interface. The basic architecture of the system\nmodel is illustrated in Fig. 1. Three main steps have\nbeen involved in developing the system: building\nthe KBS, creating the design improvement module,\nand integrating the KBS with the CAD system. The\ndeveloped system was designed in such a way in\norder to allow designers to analyse and\/or modify\nthe product at any stage of the design process. It\nworks in a fully interactive mode.\nThe designer communicates with each module via\nthe user interface. He\/she has to specify, to the\nsystem, the basic product specifications and the\nproduction data such as production volume,\nnumber of components, and number of working\nshifts. These data are employed in the system to\nselect the most economic assembly technique for\nthe product. The system then commences the design\nanalysis for the selected assembly method. The\n2 E M Shehab and H S Abdalla\nProc. IMechE Vol. 220 Part B: J. Engineering Manufacture JEM298 \u0001 IMechE 2006\nsystem presents the design analysis in an efficient\nuser interface.\nThe developed design for the automation system\nhas the capability to apply the design criteria for\nrobotic assembly. The roles of the design improve-\nment module are to:\n(a) identify automatically the candidate compo-\nnent(s) for redesign;\n(b) specify the various component features that\ncannot be assembled robotically;\n(c) provide possible alternative redesign sugges-\ntions.\nAn expert system, Kappa-PC [30] toolkit devel-\noped by Intellicorp, Microsoft Excel database, and\nAutoCAD as a CAD tool have been chosen to develop\nthe proposed system. Kappa-PC supports frame-\nbased objected oriented programming and high-per-\nformance rule-based reasoning. It also provides a\nprogramming environment and integrated set of\ntools to build a KBS for commercial and industrial\napplications.\nDiscussion of each module is presented in the fol-\nlowing sections.

It deals\nwith how to organize and encode knowledge in the\nbest form so that the problem can be easily solved.\nIn the domain of DFA, the knowledge base contains\nknowledge that provides assembly selection, assem-\nbly time and cost estimation, design analysis, and\nheuristics of redesign suggestions.\nIn this research study, open literature and hand-\nbooks of design for assembly are one of the main\nsources of the knowledge used in building the\nknowledge base for assemblability analysis and\nevaluation [8, 9, 12, 20, 31, 32]. Moreover, other\nsources come from the consultation with manu-\nfacturing experts in a company or factory.\nHybrid knowledge representation techniques are\nemployed to represent the knowledge-base of\ncomponent feeding, handling and insertion in this\nresearch. These techniques, such as production rules\n\u2013 frame and object oriented \u2013 are described in detail\nbelow.\n2.1.1 Production rules. More than 900 rules have\nbeen created in the present research project. The\nrules are connected to each other so that\nthe conclusion of one rule is included in the\npremise of another rule. This technique is called\n\u2018chaining\u2019. Both forward and backward chaining\ntechniques have been employed in the developed\nsystem. The following is an example of production\nrules used in the system to estimate the manual\nhandling time (MHT).\nMHT Rule 1\nIF (The component is\nmanipulated by one hand)\nAND\n(Tools are required to\nmanipulate the component)\nAND\n(The required tools are\ntweezers)\nAND\n(Optical magnification is not\nrequired)\nAND\n(The component is easy to\ngrasp)\nAND\n(Thickness is greater than\n0.25 mm)\nAND\n(The degree of alpha symmetric\n(a) is equal to 360\u0001)\nAND\n(The degree of beta symmetric\n(b) is less than 180\u0001)\nTHEN (the manual handling time\nis equal to 4.8 s)\n2.1.2 Frame-based and object-oriented knowledge\nrepresentation. A frame is a data structure for\nstoring interconnected information about a design\nand an object. The frame system offers both\ninheritance and exception handling properties.\nFurthermore, it is very flexible so that images and\nactive values can be attached to any slots to\nmonitor changes in value. An example of frame\nrepresentation of an object used within the\ndeveloped system is shown in Fig. 2.\nObject-oriented programming systems have sev-\neral characteristics such as data abstraction, inheri-\ntance, and modularity. The inheritance property\nenables the designer to define a specific value into\na higher class: each can be inherited by the lowest\nclass of the hierarchy. Using such a technique,\ndesign, manufacturing, and assembly techniques,\nsuch as manual assembly, automatic assembly and,\nrobotic assembly can be organized into various\nclasses represented in hierarchies. Figure. 3 shows\nobject-oriented representation of the redesign sug-\ngestions and the various assembly methods\nemployed.\n2.2 Design analysis for robotic assembly module\nAs stated earlier, the importance of robotic assembly\nis well recognized, but many designers do not have\nthe necessary knowledge of this assembly technique.\nThe advantages of robotic assembly, such as stability\nof product design, slashing the product cost, accom-\nmodation of product style variations, and no restric-\ntions on part size if the part can be presented in\npallets or part trays. This system provides the cap-\nability of carrying out design feasibility and obtain-\ning design improvement suggestions for robotic\nassembly. The architecture of design analysis for\nrobotic assembly is illustrated in Fig. 4. The first\nstage in design improvement is to identify the weak\nFig. 2 Frame representation of an object\n4 E M Shehab and H S Abdalla\nProc. IMechE Vol. 220 Part B: J. Engineering Manufacture JEM298 \u0001 IMechE 2006\npoints in the product design. The design criteria for\nrobotic assembly have been applied for each compo-\nnent. The system evaluates, technically the separate\nsubassemblies and components, as well as the whole\nassembly, for the possibility of robotic assembly. The\ncomponent and subassembly properties used are\nstiffness, vulnerable shape, sizes, symmetry, quality,\nweight, and joining method (see Fig. 4). The assem-\nbly properties include the number of components,\nbase component, and product length. The assembly\nprocess properties are categorized into status\nduring feeding, assembly direction, the need to be\nheld down during insertion, alignment difficulty,\nresistance to insertion, and the degree of motion\nduring insertion. Score points are assigned automa-\ntically by the developed system based on the\ndegree of compliance of each component specifica-\ntions with the robotic assembly criteria. The data-\nbase of property values is used to store all the\nassemblability score values and corresponding\nproperties for the product, and the database of the\nscore values saves the target value for each property.\nThe target value is obtained from the objective\nvalue and the lowest score of the property. A design\nanalysis report is generated for the designer. Atten-\ntion in the redesign stage for the robotic assembly\ntechnique focuses upon the relatively highest com-\nponent scores. The property with the highest score\nfor a component infers that this property is a subject\nfor redesign.\n2.3 The design improvement module\nRedesign suggestions are the most difficult task in\nthe developed system. Practically, a redesign sugges-\ntion is heavily dependent on experienced engineers\nand should be a teamwork task. In order to initiate\nthe suggestions for redesign, the design improve-\nment module performs three functions. First it iden-\ntifies automatically those components with the\nhighest total scores. Second it specifies the compo-\nnent and assembly process properties that are candi-\ndates for redesign. Finally it provides suggestions for\nredesign, which will simplify the task of robotic\nassembly.\nA comprehensive library of design improvement\nsuggestions has been built in the developed\nsystem. The options for product redesign to simplify\nthe assembly process are set out in Fig. 4. These\ninclude feeding, handling, and composing processes.\nExamples of the feeding processes are nesting, over-\nlapping, tangle, and orientation. Handling proce-\nsses include stiffness, vulnerable component\nweight, and shape. The composing processes\ninclude tolerances, resistance to insertion, assembly\ndirection, composing movement, joining method,\nand alignment difficulty. A series of design modifica-\ntions are provided to assist in simplifying the assem-\nbly process. The design suggestions are displayed for\nthe designer in a professional way. An example of a\nre-design suggestion is shown in Fig. 5.\nFig. 3 Object-oriented representation of the various classes of assembly systems and redesign suggestions\nA cost-effective knowledge-based reasoning system 5\nJEM298 \u0001 IMechE 2006 Proc. IMechE Vol. 220 Part B: J. Engineering Manufacture\n2.4 User interface\nA user-friendly interface has been developed (Fig. 6),\nas an important part of the proposed system, in\norder to enable the user \u2013 even a new user \u2013 to use\nthe system easily and efficiently,. It is the section of\nthe system with which a user comes into contact,\nand which he\/she forms an initial impression. The\ndesign analysis and recommendations for redesign\nsuggestions are displayed on separate screens. The\nvarious elements of the product assembly cost are\nreported to the user in a Kappa-PC window. Gra-\nphics were used in the development of the prototype\nFig. 4 Architecture of design analysis and improvement for robotic assembly\n6 E M Shehab and H S Abdalla\nProc. IMechE Vol. 220 Part B: J. Engineering Manufacture JEM298 \u0001 IMechE 2006\nsystem. Finally the user is provided with options to\nclear the working memory and restart another appli-\ncation, to produce a hard copy of the system recom-\nmendations and reports, or quit the system\naltogether.\n2.5 Database\nThe proposed model for DFA includes four groups\nof databases: assembly systems, time and costing\nfor assembly methods, assembly properties score\nFig. 5 An example of a redesign suggestion\nFig. 6 An example of the user interface developed in the system\nA cost-effective knowledge-based reasoning system 7\nJEM298 \u0001 IMechE 2006 Proc. IMechE Vol. 220 Part B: J. Engineering Manufacture\nvalues for a specific product, and target score values\nfor the assembly properties. The first group\nconsists of the assembly system selection data,\nsuch as assembly system types and their applic-\nations. The second group involves data concerning\nassembly operations, time, and cost. The third\ngroup contains the assemblability score values and\ncorresponding properties for the product. The final\ngroup includes the target value for each assembly\nproperty.\nThe proposed system operates with two types of\ndatabase: permanent (static) and temporary\n(dynamic). The permanent database, such as the\ntarget score values for various assembly operations,\nis not altered as a result of using the system over a\nperiod of time. On the other hand, the temporary\ndatabase, such as properties values database is\nupdated as a result of running the system.\n3 THE SCENARIO FOR DESIGN ANALYSIS FOR\nAUTOMATION\nThe scenario for analysing a product for design\nfor assembly is commenced by specifying the basic\nproduct specifications and the production data\n(production volume, number of components. etc.).\nBased on these data the system selects the most eco-\nnomic assembly technique for that specific product.\nAs stated earlier, detailed knowledge of the product\ndesign is not required to select the assembly method\nselection. The reason that early assembly selection is\nimportant is that manual assembly differs widely\nfrom automatic or robotic assembly in the require-\nments it imposes on the product design. The recom-\nmended assembly method is examined in the early\nstages of the design process to ensure it is consid-\nered in the product design process. The system sce-\nnario is illustrated in Fig. 7.\nThe system was designed in such a way as to\nallow designers to analyse the product economically\nfor the selected assembly method, i.e. manual,\nrobotics, or high-speed automatic. Production\nrules, developed specifically for each of these\ntechniques, are used to obtain the data that in turn\nare used to assess the components in the design,\nfor ease of handling and insertion. For instance, in\nthe case of analysis of the product for manual\nhandling and insertion, assessment is based on\nestimating manual assembly costs and using time\ndata corresponding to particular component\ndesign specifications together with operator wage\nrates.\nThe system has the capability of carrying out\ndesign feasibility and providing suggestions for the\ndesign improvement of the robotic assembly to\nmanufacturing companies. The designer\/user inter-\nacts with the system through a well-designed user\ninterface, which allows the input of the product\nand process properties. The product and process\nproperties are differentiated into component,\nassembly, and process properties. The design criteria\nfor robotic assembly have been applied for each\ncomponent. In other words, the separate subassem-\nblies and components, as well as the whole assembly\nare technically evaluated based on the score of\neach component. The system can identify, automati-\ncally, the components with the relatively highest\ntotal scores, so as to initiate the suggestions for\nredesign. A design analysis report is then generated\nfor the designer. Attention in the redesign stage\nin robotic assembly focuses upon the relatively\nhighest component scores. The various components\nin assembly operations are considered for redesign,\nto simplify the assembly process, including the\nfeeding, handling, and composing processes. The\nproperty with the highest score, for a component,\nindicates that this property must be subjected\nto redesign. A series of design modifications are\nproposed with the purpose of simplifying the assem-\nbly process.\n4 SYSTEM BENEFITS AND VALIDATION\nThe major benefit of the developed system is that it\nprovides the designer with the facility to select the\nmost economic assembly technique for the product,\nbased on the basic product specifications and the\nproduction data (production volume, number of\ncomponents, etc.), at the early stages of the design\nprocess. Assembly automation and robotic assembly\nare highly specialized fields, and most designers do\nnot have the necessary knowledge to meet all\nrequirements to achieve a good design from the\nassembly point of view. Therefore, the main func-\ntions of the system, besides estimating the assembly\ntime and cost for manual, high-speed automatic,\nand robotic assembly techniques, are to analyse the\nproduct design for automation and provide the\ndesigners with design improvement suggestions to\nsimplify the assembly operations via a user-friendly\ninterface.\nIn order to validate and demonstrate the capabil-\nities of the developed system, a scientific calculator\nwas the domain chosen as a case study. The system\nbegins with analysing the product for ease of assem-\nbly. The system then recommends the most eco-\nnomic assembly technique. Based on this\nrecommendation, the system estimates the assem-\nbly time and cost required for assembling the calcu-\nlator. Moreover, the components that are candidates\nfor redesign are highlighted by the developed\nsystem. Finally the system provides redesign\n8 E M Shehab and H S Abdalla\nProc. IMechE Vol. 220 Part B: J. Engineering Manufacture JEM298 \u0001 IMechE 2006\nimprovement suggestions to simplify the assembly\noperations. In addition to the product structure, the\nabove aims are discussed in details in the following\nsections.\n4.1 The product structure\nThe scientific calculator is composed of fourteen\ncomponents. In addition to four screws to secure\nfastening the internal parts such as printed circuit\nboard (PCB) assembly and keyboard, the other\njoining method used is snapping. Front, rear, and\nbattery covers, and adapter end are also the main\ncomponents of the calculator.\nThe assembly structure involves the sequence of\nand the relationships between single-assembly\noperations. This is determined by the manner in\nwhich the product assortment and the product\nstructure are built up from subassemblies and other\ncomponents, which in turn determine the interrela-\ntionships between product components. For the cur-\nrent case study (calculator), all the components can\nbe inserted vertically in a layer fashion from above.\nThe assembly structure and processes for the com-\nGenerating and Gathering \nProduct and company Data \nFunctionality \nof the Design\nDesign Efficiency\nTheoretical \nMinimum \nNumber \nof Parts\nCost of \nthe Ideal \nDesign \nSelecting the \nRight Assembly Method\nAutomatic Assembly \nAnalysis\nManual Assembly\nManual Handling \nand Insertion\nAnalysis \nManual Assembly \nCost\nTotal Operation \nTime\nAutomatic Handling \nand Insertion \nAnalysis\nTotal Operation \nTime\nAutomatic Assembly \nCosts \nRobotic and Gripping \nData\nTotal Operation \nTime\nRobotic Assembly \nCosts \nRobotic Assembly\nAnalysis\n Part Presentation \nAnalysis\nProduct Design \nImprovement\nFig. 7 The system scenario\nA cost-effective knowledge-based reasoning system 9\nJEM298 \u0001 IMechE 2006 Proc.

At the early design stages, the designer\nshould be aware of the nature of assembly processes\nand should always have sound reasons for requiring\nseparate components; these will lead to higher\nassembly costs, rather than combining several com-\nponents into one manufactured item.\nThe reason that early selection of an assembly pro-\ncess is important, is that manual assembly differs\nwidely from automatic or robotic assembly in the\nrequirements that it imposes on the product design.\nAs mentioned earlier an operation that is easy for an\nassembly worker may be difficult for a robot or spe-\ncial-purpose workhead [8]. The developed system\nhas the capability to recommend the most economic\nassembly technique in the early stages of the design\nprocess. The system selected the most appropriate\nassembly technique based on the following data\nthat were entered into the system:\nProduct name Scientific\ncalculator\nAnnual production volume 250 000\nNumber of production shifts 3\nDesign style 5\nNumber of components 14\nNumber of different components 2\nProduct market life 4 years\nParts defective 0.8 %\nAnnual cost per operator \u00a314 625\nCapital expenditure allowances \u00a325 000\nAs a result of the design product analysis and the\nproduction parameters (production volume, number\nof components, etc.), the system recommended the\nrobotic assembly system as the most economic\nassembly technique for assembling the calculator.\nThe procedures for assembly technique selection\nare outlined in reference [19]. Figure (9) shows the\nsystem output for the recommended assembly\ntechnique.\n4.3 Cost estimation for robotic assembly\nAfter the appropriate assembly technique was\nselected, the system began to estimate the cost of\nassembly by analysing the product design. The\ndesign analysis of the calculator\u2019s components, for\nease of robotic assembly, was examined for the var-\nious assembly processes. These assembly processes\ninclude the difficulty of component placement,\ndirection of assembly, and the difficulty of insertion\nof the components.\nFor presenting a component to a robot, three pre-\nsentation techniques are used. These are program-\nmable feeder (PF), special-purpose feeder (SF), or\nmanually loaded magazine, pallet, or component\ntray (MG). The system requests the user to specify\nwhich of these methods should be used for each\ncomponent in the product.\nTo estimate the costs for robotic assembly, it was\nnecessary to have the total cost of robots, grippers,\nand all of the special-purpose equipment. The\nmain specifications of the robot system that were\ninput to the system and used to estimate the assem-\nbly cost of the present case study are illustrated in\nTable 1. A combination of heuristics data, algorith-\nmic approach, and fuzzy logic techniques were\nimplemented. The developed system allows users\nFig. 8 Precedence diagram for complete assembly of the\nscientific calculator\n10 E M Shehab and H S Abdalla\nProc. IMechE Vol. 220 Part B: J. Engineering Manufacture JEM298 \u0001 IMechE 2006\nto generate accurate cost estimates for new designs\nand explore alternative materials and processes.\nMore details of these various cost estimation techni-\nques are presented in reference [19].\nThe multi-station assembly system cost estima-\ntion report for the scientific calculator generated by\nthe system, is illustrated in Fig. 10. A summary of\nthe analysis is shown below:\n(a) No. of work stations: 5\n(b) Assembly time: 45.90 s\n(c) Assembly cost: 37.27 p\n4.4 Design analysis and redesign improvement\nsuggestions\nThe main objectives of the design analysis of the\nproduct were to (a) ensure that the product is\ndesigned for robotic assembly technique, and (b)\nfacilitate design improvement suggestions for ease\nof assembly by identifying weak points in the design.\nThe suitability of using robotic assembly for the\nscientific calculator design is presented below.\nThe analysis of the calculator design was carried\nout using the developed system. A novel assembl-\nability evaluation score methodology was developed\nand used to assess design quality or difficulty of\nassembly operation as discussed in section 2.2. It is\nan effective tool to improve the design quality for\nease of assembly operations. In the early design\nstage, weaknesses in the design\u2019s assembly produci-\nbility are pointed out by this technique.\nIn this technique, the design criteria for robotic\nassembly have been applied for each component.\nIn other words, the separate subassemblies and\ncomponents, as well as the whole assembly, are\nevaluated based on the score for each component.\nFigure 11 shows the assemblability evaluation\nreport, generated by the system, for the robotic\nassembly technique. Figure 12 illustrates that three\nTable 1 The main specifications of the robot system for the present case study\nTechnique implemented Figure used\nCost of standard assembly robot with controls, sensors, etc. \u00a350 625\nNumber of stations on the multi-station system 5\nStandard gripper cost \u00a33125\nThe robot basic operation time 3 s\nCost of one station on free transfer machine including buffers and controls \u00a315 625\nCost of special work carriers associated with one station on a multi-station system \u00a33125\nFig. 9 System selection of the appropriate assembly technique for the scientific calculator\nA cost-effective knowledge-based reasoning system 11\nJEM298 \u0001 IMechE 2006 Proc. IMechE Vol. 220 Part B: J. Engineering Manufacture\ncomponents, \u2013 (PCB), keyboard, and spring \u2013 have a\nrelatively high total score. Redesign of these compo-\nnents is thus necessary to facilitate the robotic\nassembly operations.\nIt is important to adapt the design of the product\nto utilize automated assembly. For this reason, a ser-\nies of suggestions for modifications of the current\ndesign of the calculator, without any compromise\nto its function, were proposed with the purpose of\nsimplifying the assembly process. The redesign con-\nsidered both the product design and the assembly\noperations. The design modifications were carried\nout in two levels, the product structure level and\nthe product components level. The redesign stage\nfocuses particularly on the three components that\nhave been mentioned in section X.X. The system\ndisplayed the various properties of the three compo-\nnents which must be considered for redesign. For\nFig. 10 Multi-station robot assembly cost estimation report for the present case study\nFig. 11 The design analysis report of the calculator for robotic assembly generated by the developed system\n12 E M Shehab and H S Abdalla\nProc.

Reference source not found. For the com-\nposing movement, three motions \u2013 tilting, moving,\nand snapping \u2013 required for insertion of the PCB\nonto the front cover [see Fig. (14)]. This is because\nof the bad design of the snaps. The PCB could\nbe snapped easily by a human operator, but\nwould involve complicated motions for a robot\n[see Fig. (14)]. Therefore, the snaps at the keyboard\narea of the front assembly are redesigned to\naccommodate only one motion for insertion as\nshown in Fig. 15.\nFig. 12 The candidate components for redesign\nFig. 13 The system result showing the various properties of PCB component, which must be considered for redesign\nA cost-effective knowledge-based reasoning system 13\nJEM298 \u0001 IMechE 2006 Proc.

The system framework consists of CAD\nsystem, KBS, design analysis for automation\nmodule, design improvement suggestion module,\nand a user interface. Hybrid knowledge repre-\nsentation techniques \u2013 such as production rules,\nframes, and object oriented \u2013 are employed to\nrepresent various types of assembly knowledge in\nthis research. A user-friendly interface, which\ngrows via the utilization of powerful features\nsuch as multiple-choice menus, active images, ses-\nsions, pop-up windows, and buttons, has been\ndeveloped for providing the designers with easily\ninput data to the system and complete results of\nthe analysis.\nThe system has the capability to, besides\nestimating the assembly cost, select the most eco-\nnomic assembly technique for the product at an\nearly design stage, and analyse the product\nFig. 14 The three motions required for insertion (difficult to automate)\nFig. 15 One motion required for insertion (easy to automate)\n14 E M Shehab and H S Abdalla\nProc.
