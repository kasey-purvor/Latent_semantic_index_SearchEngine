In conclusion, we confirm the involvement of Cj1613c and ChuABCD in heme\/hemoglobin utiliza-\ntion in C. jejuni.\nThe gram-negative microaerophilic bacterium Campylobacter\njejuni is a common zoonotic commensal and the most fre-\nquently isolated causative agent of severe bacterial enteritis in\nhumans (25). In addition, previous infection with C. jejuni is\nimplicated in the serious neurological conditions Guillain-\nBarre\u00b4 syndrome and Miller-Fischer syndrome (69). The viru-\nlence mechanisms involved in infection of the human intestine\nremain unclear; however, chemotactic motility (22), toxin pro-\nduction (42), and host cell invasion (13) are likely to be im-\nportant, with the latter contributing to the formation of bloody\ndiarrhea. Iron acquisition is another important mechanism in-\nvolved in survival and persistence in the intestine (48, 59), and\nthe iron regulon is widely regarded as a virulence-associated\ngene network used by pathogenic bacteria to coordinate gene\nexpression on entry into the host environment (44).\nThe large redox potential of the Fe2\u0001\/Fe3\u0001 couple makes\niron ideally suited as a redox cofactor, and as such it can be\nfound complexed to a wide variety of enzymes in virtually all\ncell types (1). In the host, free iron is maintained at very low\nlevels in order to restrict microbial growth, and invading mi-\ncroorganisms must possess the means for acquiring sufficient\nlevels of this nutrient in order to survive and persist (19).\nHowever, the cellular toxicity of iron, resulting from participa-\ntion as a Haber-Weiss-Fenton redox catalyst in the formation\nof toxic oxygen species, chiefly the highly deleterious hydroxyl\nradical and superoxide anion, requires that the uptake and\nstorage of iron must be tightly regulated. In bacteria, this\nregulation is primarily coordinated by the ferric uptake repres-\nsor (Fur) protein, an iron-dependent transcriptional repressor\nof iron acquisition and storage genes (19). Fur has been most\nextensively studied in Escherichia coli, although homologues\nhave now been described in many other species, including C.\njejuni (60, 64). Fur-regulated genes possess a promoter-oper-\nator sequence, termed the Fur box, to which the Fe2\u0001:Fur\ndimer binds under iron-replete conditions, preventing RNA\npolymerase binding to the promoter and thus repressing tran-\nscription (10). Common bacterial iron-scavenging strategies\ninvolve uptake systems that employ high-affinity extracellular\niron-binding siderophores and their cognate membrane trans-\nport systems, ferrous iron transport proteins, transferrin and\nlactoferrin receptors, and systems involved in the acquisition of\niron in the form of heme (1).\nDue to the insolubility and toxicity of free Fe3\u0001, intracellular\niron in the host is mostly complexed to proteins in the form of\nhemin (15). For bacteria to acquire iron from hemoproteins,\nheme must first be removed from the protein complex. This\nprocess cannot be fulfilled by siderophores and may involve\nspecific degradative enzymes. In some systems, a heme-seques-\ntering protein, termed a hemophore, delivers heme to the cell\nsurface receptor (16, 30). Examples of receptors for heme or\nmajor circulating hemoproteins include the hemoglobin\/hemo-\nglobin-haptoglobin receptor complex HpuAB from Neisseria\nmeningitidis (30); the HasR heme receptor of Serratia marc-\nescens, which can function with or without the cognate hemo-\nphore HasA (29); and the hemopexin receptor HxuA of Hae-\nmophilus influenzae (8). In gram-negative bacteria, heme\ntransport across the outer membrane is energized by a TonB-\nExbB-ExbD complex, whereas transport across the inner mem-\nbrane proceeds by ATP hydrolysis involving an ABC (ATP-\nbinding cassette) complex in conjunction with a periplasmic\nshuttle protein, and both the inner and outer membrane trans-\nport genes are frequently genetically linked (15).

The subse-\nquent release of iron from ferric biliverdin in eukaryotes re-\nquires a biliverdin reductase (31). Recently, the biochemistry\nof HO-dependent heme degradation was described for several\nimportant gram-negative pathogens. The HemO protein from\nNeisseria spp. yields ferric biliverdin and CO as end products\nalthough the mechanism of iron release from this complex is\nunknown (71). Unlike eukaryotic HOs and HemO, a study of\nthe ChuS HO from E. coli O157:H7 suggested that the iron-\nfree form of biliverdin together with CO were formed as end\nproducts of heme degradation (53). A third type of gram-\nnegative HO homologue from Vibrio cholerae, termed HutZ,\nwas shown to bind heme but not degrade it and may instead be\ninvolved in heme storage to prevent cellular toxicity rather\nthan degradation (67).\nTranscriptional profiling of the C. jejuni iron regulon has\nidentified several iron-responsive genes under the control of\nthe global iron-dependent repressor Fur, including a cluster of\nfive genes, Cj1613c-Cj1617 (Fig. 1), proposed to be involved in\nheme iron acquisition (23, 39, 59). On the basis of sequence\nsimilarity to known outer membrane heme receptors, Cj1614\nwas designated chuA, while the Cj1615-17 genes show homol-\nogy to the cognate inner membrane ABC transport and\nperiplasmic binding components and were designated chuBCD\n(40). The hypothetical protein encoded by Cj1613c is arranged\ndivergently to chuABCD. Previously, chuA was shown to be\nregulated by iron and Fur (60). Analysis of the intergenic\nregion between Cj1613c and chuA reveals two 19-bp sites\nwhich align perfectly to the C. jejuni consensus Fur box se-\nquences proposed by van Vliet et al. (59) and Palyada et al.\n(39). Here, we describe the iron- and Fur-dependent regula-\ntion of the Cj1613c-17 genes and their role in heme utilization\nin C. jejuni. We conclude that chuABCD likely represents the\nmajor transport genes, although additional loci may be in-\nvolved in iron uptake from heme\/hemoproteins. Furthermore,\nwe demonstrate that degradation of heme requires the Cj1613c\ngene product, which functions as a heme oxygenase, and pro-\npose the redesignation of Cj1613c as chuZ.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nBacterial strains, plasmids, and growth conditions. All chemicals were pur-\nchased from Sigma-Aldrich (United Kingdom), and all media were purchased\nfrom Oxoid (United Kingdom) unless otherwise stated. Bacterial strains and\nplasmids used in this study are presented in Table 1. E. coli strains were cultured\naerobically at 37\u00b0C on Luria-Bertani (LB) medium supplemented where neces-\nsary with kanamycin (50 \u0003g\/ml), chloramphenicol (20 \u0003g\/ml), or ampicillin (100\n\u0003g\/ml). C. jejuni strains were routinely cultured on either Mueller-Hinton (MH)\nmedium or blood agar base no. 2 plates containing 7% defibrinated horse blood,\nsupplemented with vancomycin (10 \u0003g\/ml) and trimethoprim (5 \u0003g\/ml) at 37\u00b0C\nunder microaerobic conditions (10% CO2, 85% N2, 5% O2) in a variable-\natmosphere incubator (Don Whitley, Shipley, United Kingdom). Antibiotic se-\nlection was provided where necessary by addition of kanamycin (50 \u0003g\/ml) or\nchloramphenicol (10 \u0003g\/ml). Iron-replete conditions were achieved by addition\nof Fe2(SO4)3 to a final concentration of 40 \u0003M (60). Iron-restricted conditions\nwere achieved by addition of the iron chelator desferrioxamine mesylate (Des-\nferal) to a final concentration of 20 \u0003M (60). Clinical isolates of C. jejuni were\nobtained as a gift from J. Frost, Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens, Health Pro-\ntection Agency. Growth of C. jejuni strains in the presence of hemin or hemo-\nglobin as sole iron source at equivalent ferric molarities was achieved by addition\nof porcine hemin, to a final concentration of either 1 or 50 \u0003M, or human\nhemoglobin, to a final concentration of 0.25 or 12.5 \u0003M, to iron-restricted MH\nbroth. C. jejuni strains were initially cultured on MH agar plates overnight,\nharvested in a suitable volume of MH broth, and used to inoculate 5 ml MH\nbroth to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.05. Cultures were incubated\nmicroaerobically with shaking, and the optical density was monitored at regular\ntime intervals.\nA method adapted from Wyckoff et al. (67) was used to test the sensitivity of\nC. jejuni strains to hydrogen peroxide. Briefly, cells were harvested from MH\nagar plates and used to inoculate molten iron-restricted MH agar containing\nvarious concentrations of hemin. Following solidification, filter disks containing\n10 \u0003l of 1 M H2O2 were placed on the agar plates and incubated in the\nvariable-atmosphere incubator for 24 h, after which the diameter of the zone of\ngrowth inhibition was measured.\nMolecular biology procedures.

The target promoter region between\nCj1613c and chuA was amplified using primers EMSACHUF and EMSACHUR\n(Table 2). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were conducted as\ndescribed previously (23). The dissociation constant was calculated as follows:\nthe change in intensity of the unshifted molecular species with increasing protein\nconcentration was quantified by densitometry (GeneTools; Syngene), and the\nequilibrium dissociation constant (KD) was defined as the slope of the linear\ntransformation plotted from log(bound\/unbound) against log(unbound). Pro-\nmoter activity experiments using a lacZ reporter were performed using the E.\ncoli-C. jejuni shuttle plasmid pMW10 as described previously (62).\nRESULTS\nPhenotypic characterization of hemin utilization gene clus-\nter mutants. In order to ascertain the role of each gene in the\nputative heme utilization gene cluster (Fig. 1), a panel of mu-\ntants was constructed: JDR5 (\u0006chuA::cat), JDR6 (\u0006chuB::cat),\nJDR7 (\u0006chuC::cat), JDR8 (\u0006chuD::cat), and KAR1 (Cj1613c::\nkan) (Table 1). A phenotypic test was designed to determine\nthe requirement for each gene during growth of C. jejuni where\niron is present solely in the form of hemin or hemoglobin (Fig.\n2). Control experiments using iron-replete and iron-restricted\nconditions showed no difference between the mutant and wild-\ntype strains, and iron restriction severely inhibited growth of all\nstrains. In the presence of a low (1 \u0003M) concentration of\nhemin, all strains grew poorly, although the wild type appeared\nto grow slightly better than the mutant strains. In the presence\nof a high (50 \u0003M) concentration of hemin or both low (0.25\n\u0003M) and high (12.5 \u0003M) concentrations of hemoglobin, a clear\ndifference between the mutant phenotypes could be observed:\nstrains JDR5 and KAR1 (chuA and Cj1613c mutants) grew\npoorly, while strains JDR6, JDR7, and JDR8 (chuB, chuC, and\nchuD mutants) appeared to grow almost as well as the wild\ntype. Statistical comparison (unpaired t test) of the chuA and\nCj1613 mutants to the wild type showed both mutants to be\nsignificantly different from the wild type at 16 and 24 h in all\nassays where hemin or hemoglobin was added. These results\ndemonstrate that growth in the presence of hemin or hemo-\nglobin as a sole source of iron is highly dependent on chuA and\nCj1613c; however, these genes may not be essential, as indi-\ncated by a small level of growth in the respective mutant strains\nin the absence of an alternative iron source. Most, but not all,\ncomparisons of the chuB, -C, or -D mutants with the wild type\nare statistically different at 16 and 24 h (unpaired t test) in the\npresence of hemin or hemoglobin. However, by comparison\nwith the chuA and Cj1613c mutants, mutation of chuBCD only\npartially compromises growth in the presence of hemin or\nhemoglobin as sole iron sources. Given the phenotype of the\nchuB, chuC, and chuD mutants in comparison to that of chuA,\npolarity is unlikely to be an issue; however, despite using a variety\nof genetic strategies, we have not been able to carry out a comple-\nmentation analysis for the chuA mutant. Comparison of the\ngrowth of all strains in the presence of low hemin or hemoglobin\nconcentrations (1 ferric molarity) reveals that hemin is less effec-\ntive than hemoglobin at stimulating growth, and this may be due\nto either differences in substrate affinity or minor differences in\nsubstrate solubility in the growth media used.\nHeme utilization gene cluster content and phenotyping of C.\njejuni clinical isolates. To ascertain the prevalence of heme\nutilization genes in clinical isolates of C. jejuni, a PCR-based\napproach was initially used. Six oligonucleotide primers (chu1\nto chu6) were designed to yield amplicons spanning the\nCj1613-chu locus (Table 2), and 31 strains of clinical origin\n(Table 1) were compared with NCTC 11168. Gene-specific\nPCR mapping showed conservation of Cj1613c in all strains\ntested, whereas three strains (61666, 53486, and 35503) tested\nnegative for the presence of chuA, and two strains (61666 and\n35503) had differences in chuBCD (Table 3). Comparison of\nthe amino acid sequences predicted for ChuA orthologues\namong several C. jejuni strains, Campylobacter species, and\nnon-Campylobacter species (data not shown) reveals sequence\nvariation in the N-terminal region, which for the former may\naccount for failed amplification. To clarify these observations,\nSouthern hybridization experiments were performed using\ngene-specific probes for all five genes of strains 11168, 35503,\n53486, and 61666 (data not shown). The presence of Cj1613c,\nchuA, chuB, and chuD was confirmed in all strains (Table 3).\nInterestingly, chuC could not be identified by hybridization in\nstrain 35503, and a polymorphism for one enzyme (ClaI) was\nalso observed in this strain (data not shown). To compare the\nheme utilization phenotypes, strains 35503, 53486, and 61666\nwere tested in comparison to NCTC 11168 for their ability to\ngrow using hemin (50 \u0003M) or hemoglobin (0.25 \u0003M) as sole\niron sources (Fig. 3). Strains 35503 and 61666 showed growth\nprofiles similar to that of the reference strain, whereas strain\n53486 failed to grow well in the presence of hemoglobin or\nhemin as the sole iron source (Table 3).\nTABLE 3.

Previous tran-\nscriptional profiling studies have indicated that the Cj1613c-\nchuD genes are repressed under iron-replete conditions and\nthat this regulation is affected by Fur (23, 39). The intergenic\nspacer region between Cj1613c and chuA contains two putative\nFur box operator motifs as determined by comparison with the\nconsensus sequences described by van Vliet et al. (59) and\nPalyada et al. (39). In order to verify promoter activity and iron\nresponsiveness the Cj1613c-chuA intergenic region was ampli-\nfied with primer pair Cj1613R2-ChuAR4 (Table 2), which in-\ncorporates terminal BamHI sites. This fragment was cloned\ninto the complementary BamHI site upstream of the lacZ gene\nof the reporter plasmid pMW10 (65) to test for promoter\nactivity in both orientations (pJDR13, a chuA::lacZ transcrip-\ntional fusion, and pJDR14, a Cj1613c::lacZ transcriptional fu-\nsion) (Table 1). Additional control plasmids bearing the pro-\nmoter regions of the non-iron-regulated housekeeping gene\nmetK (pmetK) and the iron-repressed gene katA (pAV201) as\nwell as the vector alone (pMW10) were also included (Table 1)\n(62). The lacZ activity associated with each plasmid in host\nstrain C. jejuni 480 was compared under iron-restricted or\niron-replete conditions (65) (Fig. 4a). The results show that the\nfragments cloned into pJDR13 and pJDR14 possess promoter\nactivity, and this activity is induced under iron-restricted con-\nditions and reduced under iron-replete conditions.\nTo experimentally confirm Fur binding within the Cj1613c-\nchuA intergenic region, EMSA was conducted using a 218-bp\nDNA probe fragment encompassing both putative Fur boxes\nand purified recombinant FurCj (23). Figure 4b, panel A, shows\nthat in the presence of Fur, a concentration-dependent shift\ncan be seen with four consistently observed individual protein:\nDNA complex species. The first two shift species (I and II) are\nproposed to arise from the differential affinity of Fur for the\ntwo separate Fur box sites within the target DNA fragment,\nand thus successive binding events occur in a concentration-\ndependent manner. Additional shift species (III and IV) may\nbe due to Fur polymerization along the DNA fragment; a\nprocess which has been previously observed by other investi-\ngators (14, 28). The KD value for Fur binding to the probe\nDNA fragment was calculated to be 0.17 \u0003M \u000b 0.03 \u0003M,\nindicating a high binding affinity. To confirm the specificity of\nbinding, competitive EMSA using isogenic unlabeled compet-\nitor DNA was performed (Fig. 4b, panel B). An approximately\n1,000- to 1,500-fold excess concentration of competitor DNA\nwas required, indicating that Fur binding proceeds specifically.\nSpecificity of Fur binding was verified using unlabeled, non-\nspecific control DNA in place of the Cj1613c-chuA intergenic\nregion (data not shown).\nBiophysical analysis of the role of Cj1613c in hemin utili-\nzation. Recently, bacterial HOs have been implicated as the\nmajor class of enzymes involved in degradation of heme by\noxidative cleavage of the protoporphyrin ring to release iron\nvia successive \u0002-meso-hydroxyheme and verdoheme interme-\ndiates, finally yielding biliverdin and CO as by-products (6, 71).\nHowever, biochemical testing of the putative HO HutZ from\nV. cholerae indicated that although the purified recombinant\nprotein could bind heme, it could not degrade it in the pres-\nence of an electron donor, and it was therefore suggested that\nthis protein is involved in heme sequestration (67). The phe-\nnotype of the Cj1613 mutant indicates a role in heme utiliza-\ntion, and therefore the role of Cj1613c in heme binding and\ndegradation was examined by investigating the interaction of\nCj1613c with heme.

The\nability of His6-Cj1613c to bind heme in vitro was determined\nby using absorbance spectroscopy. Titration with hemin re-\nsulted in the formation of a prominent Soret peak at 411 nm\nwith a smaller peak at 573 nm and a shoulder at 540 nm\ncorresponding to the \u0002- and \t-porphyrin bands of the heme:\nHis6-Cj1613c complex, respectively (Fig. 5b). The absorbance\nmaxima at these wavelengths were achieved following addition\nof hemin to approximately 20 \u0003M and did not increase signif-\nicantly beyond this concentration up to 40 \u0003M, indicating a 1:1\nbinding stoichiometry (Fig. 5c). The presence of this complex\nwas apparent by the formation of a pale yellow coloration\ncompared to the control buffer (data not shown). The cal-\nculated molecular affinity of His6-Cj1613c for heme gave a\nKD value of 8.3 \u0003M \u000b 1.7, which is similar to, though slightly\nweaker than, affinities reported for other bacterial HOs (46,\n53, 63).\nHeme oxygenase activity may be assessed in vitro by provid-\ning the heme:enzyme complex with a suitable electron donor,\nsuch as ascorbic acid, for participation in oxidative porphyrin\ncleavage. In these experiments, the HO activity of the purified\nheme:His(6)Cj1613c complex was investigated (Fig. 5d).

No further changes were observed beyond 20\nmin. In vitro biliverdin formation was also visually apparent by\na change in coloration of the samples from pale yellow to pale\ngreen (data not shown).\nThe by-products of hemin degradation are not involved in\nprotection from peroxide stress. In eukaryotes, a reductase is\ninvolved in the conversion of ferric biliverdin to yield bilirubin,\nand furthermore, this by-product has been implicated in pro-\ntection against oxidative stress (31). This role may be particu-\nlarly relevant given the increase in intracellular iron accompa-\nnying hemin degradation, resulting in an increase in the\nHaber-Weiss-Fenton-type iron-catalyzed formation of super-\noxide and hydroxyl radical from H2O2. Mutation of Cj1613c or\nchuA may therefore starve the cells of biliverdin and thus\nprevent generation of the protective metabolite bilirubin. To\ntest whether disruption of Cj1613c or chuA renders C. jejuni\nmore sensitive to the effects of peroxide stress a simple plate\nassay was conducted. Mutants and wild-type strains were used\nto inoculate agar under iron-replete or iron-restricted condi-\ntions or with hemin as the sole iron source, and the zone of\ngrowth inhibition surrounding the filter disk impregnated with\nH2O2 was measured. No apparent difference was observed\n(data not shown), indicating that these mutants are no more\nsensitive to the effects of peroxide than the wild type.\nDISCUSSION\nEfficient transport of heme across the cell envelope of C.\njejuni is dependent on ChuA but not ChuBCD.

(41) observed that hemin, hemoglobin, hemin-\nhemopexin, and hemoglobin-haptoglobin were capable of\nstimulating growth of C. jejuni under iron-restricted condi-\ntions. Comparison of the growth profiles obtained for the wild-\ntype strain (Fig. 2 and 3) indicates that iron in the form of\nlower concentrations of hemoglobin appears to stimulate C.\njejuni growth more rapidly and to a higher final OD600 than it\ndoes in the form of hemin. These observations may reflect a\npreference for heme when supplied in the form of hemoglobin.\nIndeed, free heme is rapidly absorbed in the small intestine to\nlimit toxicity and bacterial proliferation and therefore is un-\nlikely to be the primary form encountered in vivo. Various\ndegrees of hemolytic activity have been reported for some C.\njejuni strains (24, 41). Infection by C. jejuni can result in in-\nflammatory bloody diarrhea (5), and this hemolytic activity\nmay contribute to the release of hemoglobin from erythrocytes\nduring invasion of the human gut epithelium. However, the\nrelative contribution of the major circulating hemoproteins to\nthe iron nutrition of C. jejuni and their dependence on chuA-\nBCD for translocation across the bacterial cell envelope re-\nquire further investigation. On the basis of the findings pre-\nsented here we can conclude that chuA is required for efficient\nuptake of heme or heme from hemoglobin. Due to the large\nsize of hemoglobin, we envisage that heme is removed from the\nglobin complex at the cell surface and is transported across the\nouter membrane alone.\nA phylogenetic analysis of the ChuA amino acid sequence\nwith experimentally characterized orthologous proteins from\nother bacterial species (Fig. 6) reveals that these types of\nreceptors display a pseudocladistic phylogeny. ChuA shows\nclosest relatedness to the heme\/hemoglobin- and hemoglobin-\nspecific branches, indicating that ChuA may belong to a clade\nthat contains hemoglobin-specific receptors, and as such the\npreferential utilization of hemoglobin over heme observed in\nthese studies may reflect an evolutionary trend towards in-\ncreasing substrate specificity. As the experimentally defined\ndata pool of receptor substrate specificities becomes larger, a\nmore comprehensive phylogenetic analysis, which may reveal a\nmore distinct hemoglobin-specific clade, should be possible.\nInterestingly, the S. marcescens hemophore receptor HasR\nshows close relatedness to both heme-specific and lower-spec-\nificity hemoprotein receptors, though due to the absence of\nother hemophore receptors having been described it is not\npresently possible to determine a distinct lineage.\nBy contrast to chuA, the chuBCD genes do not appear to be\nessential for heme or hemoglobin utilization. Redundancy in\ninner membrane heme transport genes has been observed with\nother bacterial heme utilization systems; for example, the Plei-\nsomonas shigelloides inner membrane transport genes hugBCD\nare not required to restore heme iron utilization in E. coli 1017\nin the presence of the hut system (21). The Yersinia enteroco-\nlitica ATPase and hemUV permease genes are essential for\nheme utilization, although the periplasmic binding component\nhemT is not required (50). Wyckoff and coworkers (66) have\nsuggested that in the absence of a strict requirement for a\nsingle inner membrane transport system, alternative ABC\ncomplexes may be capable of shuttling heme from the\nperiplasm to the cytoplasm. In C. jejuni, several putative ABC\ntransport systems associated with the iron regulon that may be\ninvolved in transport of heme-iron have been identified:\nCj0173c-5c, the putative siderophore transport system ceuB-\nCDE, and Cj1661-3 (23, 39, 59).\nAnalysis of the heme utilization gene cluster in C. jejuni\nclinical isolates revealed that all strains possess Cj1613c, which\non the basis of PCR mapping appears to be highly conserved.\nBy contrast, there appears to be a lower degree of conservation\nwithin chuA, though the biological implications of this are\nunclear at present. The heme-negative phenotype of strain\n53486 indicates that chuA, while present, may be nonfunc-\ntional, and it seems that this loss of chuA function is not\ncomplemented by the presence of an alternative receptor in\nthis strain. Likewise, substrate transport across the inner mem-\nbrane may not be a role exclusively fulfilled by chuBCD, as\nindicated by the absence of chuC in the heme\/hemoglobin\nutilization-positive strain 35503. A similar mapping study of\nthe heme utilization gene cluster of Vibrio anguillarum re-\nvealed that in most strains lacking the cluster-linked huvA\nlocus, an alternative outer membrane heme receptor gene,\nwhich was designated huvS and could complement huvA in E.\ncoli and V. anguillarum, was present (36). We have attempted\nto identify additional outer membrane heme- or hemoglobin-\nbinding proteins that may serve as alternative receptors to\nChuA using a batch affinity chromatography method (54);\nFIG. 6.

The close genetic linkage\nbetween specific heme transport and heme oxygenase loci and\nthe absence of linkage to other genes associated with the heme\nmetabolic pathway (i.e., coproporhyrinogen oxidase; Cj0992c,\nhemN) support iron nutrition as the major purpose of heme\nacquisition in C. jejuni. It may therefore be inferred that ac-\nquisition of heme may have evolved in C. jejuni solely to meet\nthe iron requirements of the cell rather than as a source of\nmetabolic heme.\nRegulation and organization of the C. jejuni heme utilization\ngene cluster. The presence of two putative Fur boxes within the\nheme utilization gene cluster led us to investigate the possibil-\nity that Cj1613c and chuABCD are expressed independently of\neach other but that their expression is dependent on Fur and\niron. The results of the reporter gene studies described here\nhave confirmed this hypothesis. Coordinated expression via a\ncommon regulator may ensure that once heme has entered the\ncytoplasm it can be promptly degraded not only to meet the\ncells\u2019 iron requirements, but also to reduce its potential toxicity\nthrough degradation to biliverdin. To date, no other candidate\nregulators of iron uptake have been identified in C. jejuni.\nIn attempts to identify additional genes involved in heme\nutilization it would be prudent to consider attributes charac-\nteristic of Cj1613c-chuD, such as classical iron-repressible, Fur-\ndependent regulation and the possession of a putative Fur box.\nThe potential existence of such genes is indicated by the ap-\nparent semiredundancy of chuBCD described here and also by\ncomparison of the Cj1613c-17 gene cluster with known heme\nutilization gene clusters from other bacterial species (21, 35,\n36). Most notable is the absence of a linked TonB-ExbB-ExbD\nsystem, which is expected to be required for energizing the\nouter membrane receptor(s). Although three putative systems\nare present in the genome of C. jejuni NCTC 11168 (Cj0179-\n81, Cj1628-30, and Cj0753c), none have yet been specifically\nassociated with heme transport. Further investigation using a\npanel of single, double, and triple ton mutants would resolve\nthis issue. Other key differences include an unlinked putative\ncoproporphyrinogen oxidase (hemN) and absence of a putative\ntranscriptional activator (66). A relatively small complement of\ngenes required for heme utilization may reflect the apparent\ngenetic minimalism observed in Campylobacter species. How-\never, several putative iron transport systems exist in C. jejuni,\nand it is reasonable to suggest that this organism utilizes var-\nious sources of iron during transmission, colonization, or in-\nfection of different host animal intestines.\nCj1613c is a heme oxygenase. Foundation studies on the\nbiochemical nature of the human HOs have formed the basis\nfor many of the current studies of bacterial HO orthologues\n(26, 68). The recent identification of heme oxygenase genes\nwithin heme utilization gene clusters in several important\ngram-negative pathogens bearing sequence homology with\nCj1613c prompted the biophysical studies presented here. The\npurified recombinant protein binds hemin in vitro at a hemin-\nto-protein ratio approaching 1:1 with moderate affinity (KD\nvalue in the low micromolar range) and displaying absorbance\nmaxima at 411, 540, and 573 nm that are similar to those\nreported for other HOs in other species (53, 67, 71). The HO\nactivity of His6-Cj1613c was confirmed by the appearance of\ncharacteristic spectral changes following addition of ascor-\nbic acid as the electron donor. Importantly, the formation of\nbroad absorbance maxima at 395 and 660 nm suggests that\nthe end product of heme degradation is the iron-free form\nof biliverdin, similar to that observed with ChuS from E. coli\nO157:H7 (53), rather than ferric biliverdin, which was sug-\ngested to be the end product of heme degradation by Neis-\nseria spp. HemO (70).\nConversion of ferric biliverdin to bilirubin in eukaryotes\nrequires a reductase (31), and it is possible that a similar\npathway may exist in prokaryotes even though no gene candi-\ndate has yet been proposed for C. jejuni. Comparison of the\nchuA and Cj1613c mutants to the wild-type strain in a peroxide\nsensitivity assay found no differences, suggesting that bilirubin,\nif produced as a by-product of hemin metabolism, may not play\nan important role in protection against oxidative stress in C.\njejuni. Alternatively, C. jejuni possesses several enzymes in-\nvolved in oxidative stress protection, namely catalase (katA)\n(17), alkyl-hydroperoxide reductase (ahpC) (3), and ferredoxin\n(fdxA) (61). Additionally, C. jejuni possesses a PerR homo-\nlogue that regulates katA and ahpC. In other organisms, PerR,\na Fur structural homologue, functions in coordinating peroxide\nstress defense and iron uptake genes using iron as a cofactor in\nresponse to intracellular peroxide, and as such a similar mech-\nanism exists in C. jejuni.\nThe coordinated expression of HO with heme uptake\nthrough iron and Fur and the subsequent HO-mediated deg-\nradation of heme to biliverdin likely serve to allow access to a\nvaluable iron source in vivo while limiting the toxic effects of\nintracellular uncomplexed heme. By comparison of the heme\nutilization gene cluster of C. jejuni with similar known gene\nclusters from other bacterial species, the confirmed and puta-\ntive functional homologues of Cj1613c commonly bear the\nsuffix -Z. On this basis we propose the redesignation of this\ngene as chuZ.\nIn conclusion, we have experimentally characterized the\nheme utilization gene cluster in C. jejuni. We have identified\nChuA as the major outer membrane transport protein for\nheme\/hemoproteins and Cj1613c (ChuZ) as a highly conserved\noxygenase required for heme degradation. ChuBCD are most\nlikely involved in the transport of heme across the inner mem-\nbrane, although they do not appear essential for this process.\nThe gene cluster is highly conserved among clinical isolates of\nC. jejuni, though additional heme transport genes may be\npresent in some strains and capable of substituting for\nchuBCD. Promoter analysis confirms classical Fur-dependent,\niron-repressible regulation of the gene cluster, though Cj1613c\nexpression is independent of chuABCD expression.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by a grant (91\/D19661) and a studentship\n(to J.D.R.) from the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research\nCouncil, United Kingdom.\nWe acknowledge Andrew Westlake, Department of Biochemistry,\nUniversity of Leicester, United Kingdom, for assistance with spectro-\nphotometric analyses and Jenny Frost and Andrew Lawson, Labora-\ntory of Enteric Pathogens, Health Protection Agency Centre for In-\nfections, London, United Kingdom, for C. jejuni strains.\nVOL. 188, 2006 HEME UTILIZATION IN CAMPYLOBACTER JEJUNI 7873\n o\nn\n August 19, 2013 by University of Leicester\nhttp:\/\/jb.asm.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nREFERENCES\n1.
