Recognition memory, source memory and theory-of-mind in ASD 3\nRecognition memory, self-other source memory, and theory-of-mind in children with \nautism spectrum disorder\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterised by a particular profile of strengths \nand weaknesses in memory (see Boucher & Bowler, 2008).  For example, whilst \nsemantic memory appears to be relatively undiminished, episodic memory appears to \nbe significantly impaired (e.g., Bowler, Gardiner, & Gaigg, 2007).  The semantic \nmemory system is responsible for the encoding, storage, and retrieval of impersonal, \nfactual information and general knowledge.  The episodic system is responsible for \nthe encoding, storage, and retrieval of personally experienced events (e.g., Wheeler, \nStuss, & Tulving, 1997).  Thus, a child with ASD might, for instance, be able to name \nthe capital city of every country in the world, whilst encountering considerable \ndifficulties when asked questions such as \u201cWhat did you do at school today?\u201d  \nOne of the key differences between semantic and episodic retrieval is that each \nis associated with a different level of conscious awareness \u2013 noetic (knowing) and\nautonoetic (self-knowing) awareness, respectively (Wheeler et al., 1997).    \nAutonoetic awareness involves focusing attention directly onto one\u2019s own subjective \nexperience, whereas noetic awareness involves thinking objectively about something \nthat one knows.  Perner (2000) proposes that autonoetic episodic memory relies on a \ntheory-of-mind (ToM).  According to this approach, episodic remembering involves \nunderstanding that what is being brought to mind during the act of remembering is a \nmental representation of a past experience. Supporting this suggestion, studies of \ntypical development have shown there to be a relationship between episodic memory \nand ToM (e.g., Perner, Kloo, & Gornik, 2007).  Although it has not previously been \ninvestigated, it is possible that the well-established difficulty that children with ASD \nLind & Bowler (2009). Recognition memory, source memory and theory-of-mind in ASD 4\nhave in representing mental states (e.g., Happ\u00e9, 1995) impacts upon their capacity for \nautonoetic awareness and hence their capacity for episodic remembering.  \nSource memory involves identifying the context under which a memory was \nacquired.  It is considered to be a function of the episodic memory system because \nonly episodic retrieval involves \u201cre-experiencing\u201d the spatio-temporal context of the \nrecollected episode (Johnson, Hashtroudi, & Lindsay, 1993; Wheeler et al., 1997).  \nFor example, remembering not only what was said in a conversation, but also who\nsaid what, may require episodic retrieval.  Johnson et al. (1993) have distinguished \nbetween three types of source memory: internal (e.g., judging whether one actually \nperformed an action or merely imagined performing that action); external (e.g., \njudging which of two individuals performed an action); and internal-external or self-\nother (e.g., judging whether it was oneself or another person who performed an \naction).  \nGiven that individuals with ASD show reduced episodic memory capacity, \nthey should show diminished performance on tasks requiring them to make source \njudgments.  Although there are some discrepancies in the literature, the majority of \nthe evidence suggests that individuals with ASD show impaired internal and external \nsource memory (Bennetto, Pennington, & Rogers, 1996; Bowler, Gardiner, & \nBerthollier, 2004; Hala, Rasmussen, & Henderson, 2005; O\u2019Shea, Fein, Cillessen, \nKlin, & Schultz, 2005; Russell & Jarrold, 1999).  However, results from studies of \nself-other source memory are less consistent, with a number of contradictory findings.  \nTwo studies have found self-other source memory to be significantly diminished \n(Hala et al., 2005; Russell & Jarrold, 1999) and three studies have found it to be intact\n(Farrant, Blades & Boucher, 1998; Hill & Russell, 2002; Williams & Happ\u00e9, 2009).  \nLind & Bowler (2009). Recognition memory, source memory and theory-of-mind in ASD 5\nHow can these discrepancies be accounted for?  In typical populations, self-\nother source judgments are easier to make than internal or external source judgments \n(e.g., Hashtroudi, Johnson, & Chrosniak, 1989).  Thus, if self-other source memory is \ndiminished in ASD, this diminution is likely to be less marked than the diminution of \ninternal or external source memory.  Therefore, group differences might yield only \nrelatively small effect sizes, which may not reach significance with small samples.  \nIndeed, the three studies of self-other source memory that failed to find ASD-specific \ndeficits, each involved small samples (n = 15 to 20).  Thus, it is unclear whether or \nnot individuals with ASD would show a diminution in self-other source memory if \nlarger samples were tested.  \nIt has been suggested that ASD may entail a particular problem with personal \nepisodic memory (Powell & Jordan, 1993) or memory for experiences directly \ninvolving the self (Hare, Mellor, & Azmi, 2007).  It is established that typical adults \nand children over the age of approximately 6 years show better memory for self-\nperformed tasks than other-person-performed tasks (e.g., Engelkamp, 1998; Roberts \n& Blades, 1998).  This memory advantage, associated with being a participating agent \nrather than an observer, is known as the enactment effect. One explanation for the \nenactment effect is that memory traces for self-performed actions are more salient \nbecause they involve an additional motoric component. Thus, the effect depends on \nthe capacity for action-monitoring.  Action-monitoring involves distinguishing \nbetween internally and externally caused changes in perceptual experience.  Despite \npast speculations that ASD might involve action-monitoring impairments (e.g.,\nRussell, 1996), subsequent research has demonstrated that this is unlikely to be the \ncase (e.g., Williams & Happ\u00e9, 2009).  Thus, children with ASD should show the\nenactment effect to the same extent as children without ASD.  \nLind & Bowler (2009). Recognition memory, source memory and theory-of-mind in ASD 6\nFindings regarding whether or not children with ASD show the enactment \neffect are inconsistent.  Only one study to date has found the effect amongst\nparticipants with ASD (Williams & Happ\u00e9, 2009).  Other studies have either failed to \nshow a significant effect (Farrant et al., 1998; Hare et al., 2007) or have found an \n\u201cobserver effect\u201d, with participants with ASD demonstrating significantly better \nmemory for another person\u2019s actions than for their own (Millward, Powell, Messer, & \nJordan, 2000; Russell & Jarrold, 1999).  The reliability of the findings of each of these \nstudies may be questioned, however, given that once again small sample sizes (n = 12 \nto 22) were used.   \nThus, the current study had three main aims.  The first was to assess self-other \nsource memory in a relatively large sample of children with ASD in order to \novercome the problem of low power, associated with previous studies.  The second\nwas to establish whether individuals with ASD are subject to the enactment effect to \nthe same extent as individuals without ASD.  The final aim was to test whether \nimpaired ToM might account for the episodic memory difficulties experienced by \nindividuals with ASD.  \nIn order to address these questions, a memory task involving both old\/new \nitem recognition and self-other source memory components was devised.  Following \nWheeler et al. (1997), recognition memory was used as an index of semantic memory \nand source memory was used as an index of episodic memory.  Although recognition \nmemory is thought to invoke both the episodic and semantic systems amongst typical \nindividuals, successful item recognition can potentially be achieved using purely \nsemantic processes.  Source memory, on the other hand, is thought to depend upon the \nepisodic memory system because it requires one to recall contextual elements of the \nlearning episode.  Thus, individuals with ASD should be able to compensate for any \nLind & Bowler (2009). Recognition memory, source memory and theory-of-mind in ASD 7\nepisodic memory difficulties by using their relatively intact semantic memory system \non the recognition element of the task but not on the source element of the task.       \nThe basic task procedure involved experimenter and child picking up and \nnaming picture cards and then, after a short delay, testing the child\u2019s item recognition \nand source memory.  ToM was assessed using a standard unexpected-contents false-\nbelief task (Perner, Leekam, & Wimmer, 1987).  It was predicted that (a) children \nwith ASD would show significantly diminished source memory but undiminished \nrecognition memory, (b) children with ASD would show the enactment effect to the \nsame extent as children without ASD, and (c) false-belief task performance would be \nsignificantly correlated with source memory performance within each group.  \nMethods\nParticipants\nApproval for this study was obtained from City University Senate Research Ethics \nCommittee.  Participants were recruited through schools in South-East England.  The \nparents of all participants gave their informed, written consent for their children to \ntake part. Two groups of participants were tested: an ASD group and a comparison \ngroup.  All of the participants in the ASD group attended specialist autism schools or \nunits, for which entry required a formal diagnosis of autistic disorder, Asperger\u2019s \ndisorder, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, or atypical autism \n(American Psychiatric Association, 2000; World Heath Organization, 1993).  A \nthorough review of the participants\u2019 Statements of Special Educational Needs \nconfirmed that they had all received formal diagnoses from qualified clinicians of \nautistic disorder or Asperger\u2019s disorder.  The comparison group consisted of children \nLind & Bowler (2009). Recognition memory, source memory and theory-of-mind in ASD 8\nwith general intellectual disability of unknown origin (to act as matches for those \nchildren with ASD who also had intellectual disability) and typically developing \nchildren (to act as matches for those children with ASD who did not have intellectual\ndisability).  Potential comparison participants were excluded if they had received \nspecific diagnoses, such as dyslexia, Down syndrome, or attention deficit \nhyperactivity disorder.  Any mention of social communication difficulties in any \ncomparison child\u2019s Statement of Special Educational Needs resulted in exclusion \nfrom the comparison group, as this may have been indicative of ASD-related \nsymptoms or even undiagnosed ASD.\nVerbal ability was assessed using the British Picture Vocabulary Scale (Dunn, \nDunn, Whetton, & Burley, 1997).  This measure was selected for the purposes of \nmatching because the experimental task involved picture naming and therefore \ndepended on vocabulary knowledge to a considerable extent.  All participants \ncompleted both the memory1 and false-belief tasks.  However, the results are \npresented in two sections, which include overlapping but not identical samples of \nparticipants.  Firstly, in Section 1, the performance of an ASD group on the memory \ntask was compared to the performance of a comparison group, who were matched on \nage and verbal ability.  The ASD group consisted of 53 children\/adolescents with\nautistic disorder (n = 49) or Asperger\u2019s disorder (n = 4).  The comparison group \nconsisted of 50 children\/adolescents with general intellectual disability of unknown\norigin (n = 27) and typically developing children (n = 23).  The characteristics of each \ngroup are presented in Table 1.  \n[place Table 1 about here]\nLind & Bowler (2009). Recognition memory, source memory and theory-of-mind in ASD 9\nThe primary aim of the second part of the study was to explore any within-\nparticipant relation between source memory and ToM task performance.  For this \npurpose, larger groups of participants with ASD and comparison participants were \nincluded.  This had the effect of increasing the power of analyses to detect \nrelationships, although it reduced the degree to which the groups were equated on \nbaseline measures.  For this aspect of the study, which is presented in Section 2, the \nASD group consisted of 73 children\/adolescents with autistic disorder (n = 65) or \nAsperger\u2019s disorder (n = 8). The comparison group consisted of 55 \nchildren\/adolescents with general intellectual disability of unknown origin (n = 27) \nand typically developing children (n = 28).  All of these participants passed the \ncontrol questions for the false-belief task, ensuring that any failure on the test question \nwas due to a specific difficulty with representing false-beliefs as opposed to \nextraneous task demands.  The characteristics of each group are presented in Table 2.\n[place Table 2 about here]\nMaterials\nFor the memory task, a master set of 42 pictures was selected from the Expressive \nOne Word Vocabulary Scale (Brownell, 2000).  On the basis of the participants\u2019 level \nof receptive vocabulary, it was expected that they would be able to label these \npictures with ease (and, indeed, no child had any difficulty with naming the pictures).    \nThis master set was used to create three fully counterbalanced versions of the test.  In \neach version, 28 pictures were used as stimuli and 14 pictures were used as distractor\nitems at test.  Each individual picture was used as a stimulus in two out of three \nversions and as a distractor in the third version.        \nLind & Bowler (2009). Recognition memory, source memory and theory-of-mind in ASD 10\nWithin each version of the test, the pictures were presented in a fixed order.  \nFor each picture, self\/other status (i.e., whether the participant or experimenter would \nbe naming the picture) was designated at random, subject to the constraints (a) that in \na given version, no more than three turns of \u201cself\u201d or \u201cother\u201d would occur in a row \nand (b) that overall, there were equal numbers of \u201cself\u201d and \u201cother\u201d pictures.  Given \nthat each picture was used in two out of three versions, individual pictures were \nassigned \u201cself\u201d status in one of those versions and \u201cother\u201d status in the other of those \nversions.    \nThe stimulus materials consisted of three sets of laminated, grey-scale \npicture cards, measuring approximately 11 \uf0b4 8 cm.  The cards assigned to the \nexperimenter were indicated by presence of a small, black \u201cx\u201d on the back.  \nFor the unexpected-contents false-belief task, the usual Smarties tube and \npencils were substituted with a \u201cPringles\u201d (well-known type of potato crisp\/chip) tube\nand a tennis ball.  \nProcedure\nParticipants completed the memory task first and then the false-belief task. \nMemory task. \nParticipants were randomly assigned one of the three versions of the task.  The \nexperimenter sat opposite the participant and placed the picture cards, face-down in \nbetween them, whilst giving the participant the following instructions: \u201cNow we\u2019re \ngoing to play a picture naming game.  I\u2019d like you to try to remember the names, \nbecause I\u2019m going to see how many you can remember later on.  Sometimes, I\u2019m \ngoing to pick up a picture and name it and sometimes, you\u2019re going to pick up a \nLind & Bowler (2009). Recognition memory, source memory and theory-of-mind in ASD 11\npicture and name it.  I\u2019ll tell you whose turn it is each time.\u201d  The experimenter and \nchild then began picking up and naming the pictures.  For each picture, the \nexperimenter provided a verbal cue to indicate whose turn it was.  If the participant \ndid not pick up the picture after the initial cue, the experimenter gave the prompt, \n\u201cCan you pick up the picture and name it?\u201d If the participant did not respond with a \nlabel, the experimenter gave the prompt, \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d  If the child gave a name for \nthe picture that did not correspond to the \u201cexpected\u201d name (e.g., \u201cbunny\u201d instead of \n\u201crabbit\u201d), this was noted and used as a substitute for the \u201cexpected\u201d name at test.  \nAfter a filled delay of two minutes, the participants were told, \u201cOK, now I\u2019m \ngoing to read out some names of things and I want you to tell me whether or not we \nsaw those things in the pictures we looked at earlier.  We saw some of the things \nearlier but others we didn\u2019t see.\u201d  The experimenter then read aloud the recognition \ntest list, which included the labels for all of the 42 pictures in the master set, in a fixed \norder, each time saying, \u201cDid we see a picture of a [recognition item]?\u201d (assessing \nrecognition memory). When the participant identified an item as old, responding with \n\u201cyes\u201d, they were asked, \u201cWho picked up the picture of the [recognition item] and \nnamed it? (assessing source memory). Participants\u2019 responses were noted on a test \nrecord form at the time of testing.  \nFalse-belief task.\nThe experimenter removed the Pringles tube from a plastic bag, showing it to the \nchild, and asking them, \u201cWhat\u2019s in here?\u201d  They were then shown the true contents \nand told, \u201cNo, it\u2019s a ball.\u201d  The ball was then replaced and the box was closed again.  \nThe child was then asked the following questions: (a) \u201cWhat\u2019s in here?\u201d (first reality \ncontrol question); (b) \u201cYour teacher hasn\u2019t seen this box.  When s\/he comes in later, \nLind & Bowler (2009). Recognition memory, source memory and theory-of-mind in ASD 12\nI\u2019ll show her\/him this box just like this and ask her\/him what\u2019s in here.  What will s\/he \nsay?\u201d (test question); (c) \u201cIs that what\u2019s really in the box?\u201d (second reality control \nquestion).\nScoring\nPerformance on yes-no recognition tests is typically summarised by measures of \n\u201cdiscrimination\u201d and \u201cresponse bias\u201d.  Discrimination measures provide an estimate \nof memory accuracy \u2013 the ability to discriminate between old (studied) and new \n(distractor) test items.  Response bias measures quantify the tendency to respond \neither predominantly liberally (\u201cyes\u201d responses) or conservatively (\u201cno\u201d responses).  \nImportantly, both types of measure take into account both correct and incorrect \nresponses.  \nMeasures of discrimination and response bias are calculated using the more \nbasic measures, \u201chit-rate\u201d and \u201cfalse-alarm-rate\u201d.  Hit-rate is the percentage of old \nitems correctly identified as old. False-alarm-rate is the percentage of new items \nincorrectly identified as old.  \nThe current data were suited to the non-parametric indices of item \ndiscrimination and response bias, A' and B\"D (see Donaldson, 1992).  A' and B\"D\nscores were calculated as shown in equations (1) and (2) below (where H = hit-rate, \nand FA = false-alarm-rate): \n(1) A' = 1\/2 + [(H \u2013 FA)(1 + H \u2013 FA)]\/[4H(1 \u2013 FA)]\n(2) B\"D = [(1 \u2013 H)(1 \u2013 FA) \u2013 HFA]\/[(1 \u2013 H)(1 \u2013 FA) + HFA]\nLind & Bowler (2009). Recognition memory, source memory and theory-of-mind in ASD 13\nHigher values of A' indicate better item discrimination and the maximum score is \n1.00.  Values of B\"D which are greater than zero indicate a conservative bias (a greater \ntendency to identify test items as new) and values which are less than zero indicate a \nliberal bias (a greater tendency to identify test items as old).   \nBecause self-other differences in recognition memory were to be explored, \nseparate hit-rates were calculated for items that had been picked up by the child (self) \nand those that had been picked up by the experimenter (other) at study.  These \u201cself\u201d \nand \u201cother\u201d hit rates were subsequently used in the calculation of A' item \ndiscrimination and B\"D response bias estimates, such that separate \u201cself\u201d A' and B\"D\nscores, and \u201cother\u201d A' and B\"D scores were derived.  Given that false-alarm-rates are \nnecessarily derived from performance on distractor items, which by definition are not\nassociated with either self or other, a single common false-alarm-rate was used for \ncalculation of both \u201cself\u201d and \u201cother\u201d A' and B\"D scores\n2.\nSource memory scores were calculated using the method recommended by \nBayen, Murnane, and Erdfelder (1996), which ensures that scores are largely \nindependent of recognition memory.  Thus, source memory score was the proportion \nof correctly recognised items for which the source was correctly identified.  Separate \n\u201cself\u201d and \u201cother\u201d source memory scores were calculated as follows: \u201cself\u201d source \nmemory = number of correct source attributions for self\/number of hits for self; \n\u201cother\u201d source memory = number of correct source attributions for other\/number of \nhits for other.  \nLind & Bowler (2009). Recognition memory, source memory and theory-of-mind in ASD 14\nResults\n\u201cResults\u201d section is divided into two subsections (i.e. Section 1 and Section 2).\nSection 1: Group differences in recognition and source memory\nTable 3 displays mean \u201cself\u201d and \u201cother\u201d recognition (A' and B''D) and source memory \nscores for the ASD and comparison groups.  \n[place Table 3 about here]\nSeparate one-sample t-tests for each group revealed that both groups obtained \u201cself\u201d\nand \u201cother\u201d A' (all ts > 16.61, all ps < .001, all rs > .92) and \u201cself\u201d and \u201cother\u201d source \nmemory (all ts > 6.50, all ps < .001, all rs > .67) scores that were significantly above \nchance (.50).  \nIn order to assess group and self-other differences in (a) A' item discrimination \nscores, (b) B''D response bias scores, and (c) source memory scores, three 2 (Group: \nASD\/comparison) \uf0b4 2 (Self-Other: self\/other) mixed ANOVAs were conducted, with \nGroup as the between-participants variable and Self-Other as the within-participants \nvariable.  The results of these analyses are reported in Table 4.\n[place Table 4 about here] \nRecognition memory measures.\nThe analysis of A' scores revealed that the groups did not significantly differ in their \nability to discriminate between old and new test items \u2013 they showed very similar \nLind & Bowler (2009). Recognition memory, source memory and theory-of-mind in ASD 15\nlevels of recognition memory.  Also, irrespective of group, participants showed \nsignificantly better item discrimination for \u201cself\u201d items than for \u201cother\u201d items.  \nThe analysis of B''D scores indicated that the groups each showed similar \nlevels of (conservative) response bias but, regardless of group membership, there was \na significantly stronger bias for \u201cother\u201d items than for \u201cself\u201d items.  B''D scores of zero \nindicate no response bias.  Thus, a one-sample t-test was conducted to establish \nwhether participants obtained \u201cself\u201d B''D and\/or \u201cother\u201d B''D scores that were \nsignificantly above zero.  These indicated that the scores were significantly above \nzero (\u201cself\u201d: t(102) = 2.59, p = .01, r = .25; \u201cother\u201d: t(102) = 9.03, p < .001, r = .67), \nconfirming the presence of a genuine response bias  \nSource memory measures.\nThe analysis of source memory scores indicated that individuals with ASD performed \nsignificantly less well on the source memory task than comparison individuals.  \nAdditionally, individuals from both groups showed significantly better source \nmemory for \u201cself\u201d items than \u201cother\u201d items.  \nSection 2: The relationship between ToM and source memory\nA total of 37\/73 (50.7%) participants with ASD passed the false-belief task, compared \nto 37\/55 (67.3%) comparison participants.  The association between group and false-\nbelief task performance was significant, \uf063\u00b2(1) = 3.54, p = .04, \uf066 = .17.  The \u201cself\u201d and \n\u201cother\u201d source memory scores for false-belief task passers and failers within the ASD \nand comparison groups are displayed in Table 5.  \n[place Table 5 about here]\nLind & Bowler (2009). Recognition memory, source memory and theory-of-mind in ASD 16\nBoth groups obtained \u201cself\u201d and \u201cother\u201d source memory scores which were \nsignificantly above chance (all ts > 5.47, all ps < .001, all rs > .62).  \nSeparate point biserial correlations were calculated for each of the groups, in \norder to assess the possible relationship between false-belief task performance and \n\u201cself\u201d and \u201cother\u201d source memory.  These correlations are reported in Table 6.  \n[place Table 6 about here]\nThey revealed that \u201cself\u201d source memory was not significantly related to false-belief \ntask performance within either group.  However, \u201cother\u201d source memory was \nsignificantly related to false-belief task performance within both the ASD and \ncomparison groups.\nAdditional analyses were conducted in order to ensure that the relationship \nbetween \u201cother\u201d source memory and false-belief task performance was not \nconfounded by the effects of chronological age (CA), verbal mental age (VMA), or \nverbal IQ (VIQ).  \u201cOther\u201d source memory was not significantly correlated with CA or \nVIQ within either group (all rs < .14, all ps > .23).  \u201cOther\u201d source memory was \nsignificantly correlated with VMA within the ASD group, r = .32, p < .01, but not \nwithin the comparison group, r = .20, p = .15.  Moreover, VMA was also significantly \ncorrelated with false-belief task performance within each of the groups, (ASD: rpb = \n.43, p < .01; comparison: rpb = .35, p < .01).  \nThus, to ensure that the apparent relationship between \u201cother\u201d source memory \nand false-belief task performance within each group was not merely an artefact of the \neffect of VMA, partial correlations were conducted, controlling for the effect of \nLind & Bowler (2009). Recognition memory, source memory and theory-of-mind in ASD 17\nVMA.  These are also reported in Table 6.  It was found that after controlling for the \neffect of VMA, \u201cother\u201d source memory and false-belief task performance were not \nsignificantly correlated within the ASD group but they were still significantly \ncorrelated within the comparison group.  \nIn order to compare the bivariate and partial correlations between \u201cother\u201d \nsource memory and false-belief task performance within the ASD group to the \ncorrelations within the comparison group, Fisher\u2019s Z transformations were conducted.  \nThese indicated no significant group differences in either the bivariate, Zr1-r2 = 0.74, p \n= .45, or partial, Zr1-r2 = 1.12, p = .26, correlations.  \nDiscussion\nIn line with predictions, the results demonstrated undiminished recognition memory \nbut significantly diminished source memory amongst children with ASD.  Participants \nwith and without ASD were similarly able to discriminate between old and new test \nitems, demonstrating comparable levels of item recognition accuracy. These results \nmirror previous research, which has also demonstrated unimpaired recognition \nmemory amongst high-functioning individuals with ASD (e.g., Minshew, Goldstein, \nMuenz, & Payton, 1992).  Both groups also showed a similar magnitude of \nconservative response bias, which indicates a tendency to favour \u201cno\u201d responses.  \nThis suggests that both groups were using similar decision criteria when considering \nwhether or not they had seen an item at study.  \nThese results should, however, be interpreted with some degree of caution, \ngiven that the mean A' scores for both groups were fairly high, particularly the \u201cself\u201d \nA' scores.  This may suggest that the task lacked the sensitivity necessary to detect \nLind & Bowler (2009). Recognition memory, source memory and theory-of-mind in ASD 18\nlatent group differences.  However, it is reassuring that only 12% of the sample \nperformed at ceiling, and when these participants were excluded and the data were re-\nanalysed, the results did not substantively change. One final point to make here is the \nfact that the groups performed so similarly on the recognition memory measures\ndemonstrates that the groups were well matched on the areas of intellectual ability \nthat were essential to the experimental task and further supports the use of the BPVS \nas a matching tool in the current study. \nAlthough both groups of participants performed reasonably well on the source \nmemory element of the task, participants with ASD demonstrated significantly poorer \nself-other source memory than comparison participants.  However, the effect size (r = \n.19) was small (but, notably, of a similar magnitude to that yielded by the group \ndifference in ToM task performance: \uf066 = .17), indicating that the impairment was\nrelatively subtle.  Therefore, it is perhaps unsurprising that previous studies of self-\nother source memory in ASD have yielded inconsistent results.  The current findings \nmight be considered to provide a more authoritative picture of the self-other source \nmemory abilities of individuals with ASD, and are consistent with the proposal that \nsemantic memory functions comparatively well in ASD, whereas episodic memory is \nsignificantly impaired.  \nOne interpretation of the current pattern of results (i.e., intact recognition but \nimpaired source memory in the ASD group) is that on the recognition component of \nthe task, participants with ASD were able to compensate for their impaired episodic \nmemory by utilising their intact semantic memory.  Such a compensatory process\nwould not, however, facilitate performance on the source memory component of the \ntask, which required the recollection of contextual information (i.e., who it was that \nLind & Bowler (2009). Recognition memory, source memory and theory-of-mind in ASD 19\npicked up and named the given picture card), and hence the ASD group were \nimpaired on this element.\nAlso consistent with predictions, participants, both with and without ASD,\nshowed an enactment effect \u2013 that is, significantly superior recognition and source \nmemory for \u201cself\u201d items than for \u201cother\u201d items.  That is, they showed better memory \nfor self-performed, as opposed to experimenter-performed actions.  It was interesting \nto find that each group also showed a significantly stronger conservative response bias \nfor \u201cother\u201d items than for \u201cself\u201d items.  This suggests that participants experienced a \ngreater degree of uncertainty when deciding whether \u201cother\u201d items, rather than \u201cself\u201d \nitems, were old or new.  Together, these results suggest that memory traces for \u201cself\u201d \nitems were more strongly encoded, possibly because of the additional motoric \ncomponent, and were more readily retrieved as a consequence.  \nThe finding of a typical enactment effect, alongside overall lower levels of \nsource memory performance in the ASD group, is consistent with the idea that action-\nmonitoring is intact whereas episodic memory is impaired in this population.  Thus, \nthe results seem to indicate a diminution of episodic memory per se rather than a \nspecific problem of personal episodic memory or memory for experiences directly \ninvolving the self (which would result in a reduced enactment effect), as previously \nsuggested by Powell and Jordan (1993) and Hare et al. (2007).  \nThe final prediction was that ToM and source memory task performance \nwould be significantly related within each of the groups.  The results indicated that in \nthe comparison group, false-belief task performance was not significantly correlated \nwith \u201cself\u201d source memory but it was significantly correlated with \u201cother\u201d source \nmemory, even after statistically controlling for the effect of VMA.  In the ASD group, \nfalse-belief task performance was not found to be significantly correlated with either \nLind & Bowler (2009). Recognition memory, source memory and theory-of-mind in ASD 20\n\u201cself\u201d or \u201cother\u201d source memory, once the effects of VMA were statistically \ncontrolled.  However, it was found that the size of the correlation between \u201cother\u201d \nsource memory and false-belief task performance did not significantly differ between \nthe ASD and comparison groups, implying that the groups were not showing \nqualitatively distinct patterns of association with respect to these variables.\nThese findings are somewhat challenging to interpret.  Superficially, they \nseem to suggest that ToM impairments in ASD do not account for episodic memory \ndifficulties.  This raises the question of why individuals with ASD do manifest \nepisodic memory difficulties.  A number of researchers have claimed that diminished \nautonoetic consciousness in ASD may contribute to episodic memory impairments \n(e.g., Bowler, Gardiner, & Grice, 2000; Lind & Bowler, 2008; Toichi, 2008).  \nCertainly, attenuated autonoetic awareness would impact upon the ability to mentally \nre-experience past episodes \u2013 an ability which is necessary to make reliable self-other \nsource judgements.  However, the results of the current study suggest that if the\nsource memory difficulties observed amongst participants with ASD were the \nconsequence of a diminished capacity for autonoetic awareness, this was unlikely to \nbe a downstream effect of impaired ToM.  Perhaps, instead, impaired autonoetic \nconsciousness in ASD is connected with other related difficulties, such as a generally \nreduced capacity for introspection (Hurlburt, Happ\u00e9, & Frith, 1994) and diminished \nself-awareness (e.g., Hobson, 1990).\nAn alternative explanation for the source memory difficulties, observed \namongst participant with ASD in the current study, is that individuals with ASD have \ndifficulties with binding together the various elements of episodes within memory\n(Gaigg, Gardiner, & Bowler, 2008).  Such relational memory difficulties could easily\ncontribute to source monitoring difficulties.  In the current task, for example, in order \nLind & Bowler (2009). Recognition memory, source memory and theory-of-mind in ASD 21\nto make a correct source judgement, it was necessary to bind together at least two \nelements of the study episode \u2013 i.e. what the item was and who picked up and named \nthe item.\nAnother possible explanation for the non-significant relationships between the \nsource memory measures and false-belief task performance in the ASD group is that \nfalse-belief task performance amongst children with ASD may not invariably index a \nrepresentational ToM.  Some children with ASD may be able to use compensatory, \nnon-ToM strategies to \u201chack out\u201d solutions to typical false-belief tasks (e.g., Happ\u00e9, \n1995).  For example, they may be able to utilise their syntactic knowledge (i.e.,\ncomplement syntax; e.g., Lind & Bowler, in press; Tager-Flusberg & Joseph, 2005) or \ngeneral memory skills (e.g., Williams & Happ\u00e9, in press) to facilitate task \nperformance.  Thus, on the basis of the current results, we cannot entirely rule out the \npossibility that impaired ToM contributes to source memory difficulties in ASD.  \nFuture research may attempt to address this issue by utilising non-verbal ToM tasks, \nsuch as Baron-Cohen, Leslie, and Frith\u2019s (1986) picture sequencing task.\nThe finding that false-belief understanding was related specifically to \u201cother\u201d \nsource memory (in the comparison group) seems to suggest that developments in \nToM are involved in the development of memory for actions that one has observed \nanother person perform to a greater extent than memory for one\u2019s own actions.  One \npossible explanation for this is that source memory for the experimenter\u2019s cards relied \non episodic recollection to a greater extent than source memory for one\u2019s own cards.  \n\u201cSelf\u201d source memory may be partially accomplished through action monitoring: \nencoding a conscious motor image may facilitate memory for one\u2019s own actions.  But, \nremembering the actions of others may be more heavily dependent on the ability to \nbecome autonoetically aware of one\u2019s own memories.  Furthermore, children with a \nLind & Bowler (2009). Recognition memory, source memory and theory-of-mind in ASD 22\nwell developed ToM might be more likely to attend to, and therefore encode, \ninformation about what others are doing and hence have more elaborate memories for \nothers\u2019 actions.  \nIn summary, in line with predictions, children with ASD showed significantly \ndiminished self-other source memory, but undiminished recognition memory and a \ntypical enactment effect, relative to age and verbal ability matched comparison \nchildren.  However, contrary to predictions and despite the fact that, as a group, \nparticipants with ASD showed a similar degree of impairment in both source memory \nand ToM, these abilities were not significantly associated.  These results do not, \ntherefore, support the hypothesis that impaired ToM accounts for the episodic \nmemory difficulties experienced by individuals with ASD.  \nLind & Bowler (2009).

Recognition memory, source memory and theory-of-mind in ASD 30\nFootnotes\n(1) A number of participants (23 with ASD, 6 comparison) gave perseverative \nresponses to the item or source components of the memory test (i.e., provided the \nsame response to more than 90% of questions).  The mean (SD) verbal mental age \n(VMA), chronological age (CA), and verbal IQ (VIQ) of the participants with ASD \nwho gave perseverative responses was 5.91 (1.45), 10.27 (3.38), and 66.96 (18.19), \nrespectively.  The mean (SD) VMA, CA and verbal IQ of the comparison participants \nwho gave perseverative responses was 4.48 (1.45), 7.03 (5.53), and 83.83 (33.13), \nrespectively.  Because the performance of these individuals would not have been a \nfair reflection of their item or source memory ability (but rather their executive \ndifficulties), these individuals were excluded from the sample.\n(2) Following the suggestion of Dr Chris Jarrold, who reviewed this paper, we also \ntried an alternative method of determining false-alarm-rates.  Specifically, half of the \ndistractors were arbitrarily assigned to be \u201cself-distractors\u201d and half to be \u201cother-\ndistractors\u201d, and then separate false-alarm-rates were calculated.  The data were re-\nanalysed using these \u201cself\u201d and \u201cother\u201d false alarm rates, but the pattern of results did \nnot differ from those presented in the main body of the paper.      \nLind & Bowler (2009).
