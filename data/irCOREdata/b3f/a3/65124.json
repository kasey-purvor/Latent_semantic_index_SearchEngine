In many ways the terrain on which \nthey operate is the ground between Marxism and post-structuralism. Eric Sheppard, for \ninstance, suggests that radical geography was Marxist inflected, but that critical geography \nhas been influenced by post-structuralism and feminism. The question that remains is to \nwhat extent the former has been eclipsed, lost, in the transition to the former. One of the \nways in which post-structuralism has criticised Marxism, as these papers illustrate, concerns \nthe question of the dialectic. This is not the only object of critique, certainly, but many post-\nstructuralist accounts have taken issue with the supposedly linear, teleological and \nageographical aspects of the classical dialectic.2 \n \nThese papers take a rather different approach. Although they do not agree on everything, \nsome key themes can be pointed to. Rather than try to offer a post-structuralism without the \n                                                 \n1 stuart.elden@durham.ac.uk \n2  For a discussion of dialectics in their more theoretical sense, in relation to Lefebvre, see \nElden 2004, especially Chapter One. For a broader discussion, see Rose 1984. \n 2 \ndialectic, they instead try to illustrate how many so-called post-structuralist thinkers have a \nprofoundly ambivalent relation to the dialectic: one that is not uncritical, but nor one that \nevidences a wholesale rejection. For Sheppard, when faced with post-structuralist critiques of \ndialectics, the response is to offer the Hegelian dialectic up as a sacrifice in order to retain \nand maintain something other in the dialectic, which for him is a geographical resonance, \nthat can bear fruitful comparison with Deleuze and Guattari. Chris Collinge\u2018s essay, \n\u2015Positions Without Negations?\u2016 operates within the domain opened up by Lefebvre and \nHarvey\u2018s introduction of Hegelian and Marxist ideas, which he thinks through in relation to \nscale. Collinge suggests that Derrida\u2018s work on contingency can be helpful in broadening the \nreach of the dialectic, since it indicates \u2015a conflict of forces rather than a contradiction of \nmeanings, a conflict that does not lead towards teleological completion but towards a \ndeferral of completion in the endless displacement from one term to the next\u2016 (2008: 5). \nThis is illustrated by thinking through Neil Smith\u2018s Uneven Development (1984). Gidwani offers \na rather different account, but he too wants to expose the problems of the Hegelian dialectic \nin order to pursue more progressive political and theoretical aims. His immanent reading and \ncritique of Hegel is designed to show what other possibilities lie obscured in his thought but \nalso what political problems are at stake. He does this through an engagement with Frantz \nFanon, whom he describes as \u2015an acute and disloyal reader\u2016 of Hegel (Gidwani 2008: 1, 7). \nThe fulcrum is a reading of the famous master-slave or \u2017lord-bondsman\u2018 dialectic in The \nPhenomenology of Spirit.  \n \nWhile Gidwani\u2018s reading shows a particular fidelity to his texts, not all of the contributions \noperate in that register. Sheppard explicitly wants to \u2015provocatively identify and make space \nfor alternative readings\u2016, which he identifies\u2014perhaps anticipating critical responses\u2014as \u2015a \n 3 \nsmash-and-grab philosophy\u2016 (Sheppard 2008: 4). Drawing on Bhaskar\u2018s Dialectic: The Pulse of \nFreedom (1993) he shows how the dialectic exceeds and includes Hegel, often wrongly \nidentified as the privileged site of dialectical thought, and unfairly characterized as \n\u2015thesis\/antithesis\/synthesis\u2016 (as he is here, in passing \u2013 Sheppard 2008: 5).3 There are a \nnumber of issues in this presentation, but mindful of the \u2017smash-and-grab\u2018 defence, I will \nnote only one. This is the use of Roy Bhaskar as the interpretative schema for dialectical \nthought. While this is indeed a remarkable book, one of the notable things about it is that \nBhaskar is trying to reconcile a Marxist dialectical approach with his own thought, thus \narguing that dialectical relations are themselves real, rather than simply objects of thought. \nThe critique of Hegel on the dialectic is as much for its idealism as its construction and \nteleology, something that is acknowledged in part (Sheppard 2008: 9). But this goes beyond \nMarx\u2018s own materialist critique, and bears on Bhasker\u2018s own critical realism. We should \nnever forget that short-cuts do not just get us from A to B quicker, but they take us through \ndifferent terrain en route. \n \nSheppard\u2018s commentary though does have the important merit of trying to open up the \nground upon which some of geography\u2018s less-than-edifying recent debates have taken place. \nHe refers to the \u2017What\u2018s Left\u2018 spat which begun in the pages of Antipode, and the \u2017scale vs. \nflat ontology\u2018 discussions in Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers.  Sheppard\u2018s \nattempt to show that the different positions in these debates actually share some barely-\nacknowledged commonalities is helpful, and his attempt to show how \u2015dialectics and post-\nstructuralism can be mutually constitutive\u2016 (Sheppard 2008: 12) is genuinely illuminating. \n                                                 \n3  Ruddick\u2018s distance from this reading is more appropriate (2008: 3-4). \n 4 \nThe tensions between the two need to be worked through rather than set up as opposed: a \ndialectical way of thinking and working through difference. Ruddick\u2018s intention is remarkably \nsimilar, cautioning that geographical thought should not try to institute simple opposites, and \ninstead recognise points of convergence alongside divergence. This is what she calls \u2015a \ndialectics of the positive \u2013 understanding their encounter, not as the negative of each other, \nbut reading each in terms of their own adequate truth\u2016 (Ruddick 2008: 1). \n \nMany of the other papers operate within this remit. Anna Secor, for instance, in \u2015\u017di\u017eek\u2018s \nDialectics of Difference and the Problem of Space\u2016, tries to show how \u017di\u017eek provides the \npossibility of \u2015an open dialectic without synthesis or totality\u2016 (Secor 2008: 1). Her focus is \non the notion of \u2017the parallax view\u2018 (\u017di\u017eek 2006) where conflicting views on things do not \nneed to be reconciled, adjudicated between, or disproved, but can all be correct at the same \ntime if we see them from different perspectives. To take an example of this in \u017di\u017eek, albeit \none not cited by Secor herself: \n \n\u2015The three \u2017true\u2018 reasons for the attack on Iraq (ideological belief in Western \ndemocracy \u2013 Bush\u2018s \u2017democracy is God\u2018s gift to humanity\u2018; the assertion of \nUS hegemony in the new world order; economic interests \u2013 oil) should be \ntreated like a \u2017parallax\u2018: it is not that one is the \u2017truth\u2018 of the others; the \u2017truth\u2018 \nis, rather, the very shift of perspective between them2 (\u017di\u017eek 2004: 6). \n \nOnce again Deleuze is a stage along the way to allow the possibility of \u017di\u017eek\u2018s insights to \ncome through, a productive tension that Secor calls a \u2015dance\u2016 (Secor 2008: 2), but which is \nmore easily reconciled when we realize that it is \u017di\u017eek\u2018s Deleuze\u2014that is an already more \n 5 \namenable figure\u2014that is at stake here (Secor 2008: 3; see \u017di\u017eek 2003). \u017di\u017eek, we are told, \noffers \u2015a dialectics that employs no binary logic; there is no \u2015Other\u2016 of the One, only a \nmultitude of attempts to fill in for the lack of the Other. It eschews the notion of a mediated \nunity, a synthetic whole or All\u2016 (Secor 2008: 6). \n \nSecor uses this to contest David Harvey\u2018s account of the war in Iraq as illustrating the \ntensions between the logics of capital and territory (2003), a conceptual move he makes \nbuilding upon Giovanni Arrighi (1994). For Harvey there are two contrasting elements \nwithin capitalist imperialism: on the one hand its basis in state politics and on the other the \nflow of capital between and beyond such strict territorial boundaries. Capital usually operates \nbeyond territorial strategies. While usually this is without explicit conflict, at times the logic \nof capital dictates a territorial violation. For Secor, following \u017di\u017eek, \u2015the war itself arises as \nthe symptom of the ways in which the imperatives of neoliberal globalization are \nirreconcilable with the territorial and military mandate of the imperial state\u2026 The war on \nIraq has not married territorial and economic logics; rather, it serves to paper over their \ncomplete lack of relation\u2016 (Secor 2008: 8). This attempt to stress the \u2015between\/within\u2016 of \nthe parallax gap is conceptually interesting, but politically disabling. How does recognition of \nthis irreconcilability enable a response? What, beyond a mere statement of the issue, are we \nto make of this? The terrible political problems of \u017di\u017eek\u2018s recent book In Defence of Lost \nCauses (2008b) seem to be a symptom of this malaise (see also 2008a). \n \nMarcus Doel\u2018s \u2015Dialectics Revisited: Reality Discharged\u2016 works in a similar register to \nSecor\u2018s, and similarly operates within the domain Sheppard sought to open up. It uses \nDerridean deconstruction and post-structuralism more generally to rethink the notion of \n 6 \nreality, or the Real. It advances the challenging idea that reality may actually be discharged \u2013 \nthat is, without fundamental or essential polarization, agonism or conflict. Rather than \nhaving positive or negative charge, Doel asks what would happen if we thought it \u2015in terms \nof blankness? What if the Real were Earthed?\u2016 (Doel 2008: 4). Indeed his conclusion is that \n\u2015the Open is bereft of charge, and for that very reason, dialectics has no purchase \nwhatsoever on the Real\u2016 (Doel 2008: 19). These provocations are somewhat eclipsed by the \nmode of expression at play here, with allusion and illusion\u2014the magician\u2018s rabbits\u2014giving \nway to comments on formal dialectical logic. What is intriguing here is that the readings on \ndialectics are not through reference to Hegel or Marx, or even to Marxist commentators, but \nto writers such as Derrida and Lyotard whose conclusions allow Doel to pursue his claim \nthat \n \n\u2015The Real is Open: nothing more, nothing less. Hereinafter, it will be \nnecessary for geographers to content themselves with an Open Reality bereft \nof charge. Space takes place, and neither the plus nor the minus have any \npurchase on any situation whatsoever\u2016 (Doel 2008: 19). \n \nDialectics as \u2018Baggy Clothes\u2019 \nDoel earlier cites Deleuze on dialectics to reinforce this point. In the book Bergsonism, \nDeleuze suggests that too much abstract thought works with concepts that \u2015like baggy \nclothes, are much too big\u2016 (1991: 44; see Doel 2008: 14). This, Doel tells us, is \u2015why Deleuze \nwill have no truck with the dialectic\u2016 (2008: 14). \u2015The combination of opposites tells us \nnothing: it forms a net so slack that everything slips through\u2016 (Deleuze 1991: 44\u201345). Henri \nBergson himself had argued that dialectics do not deal with the world as it is, in all its \n 7 \ncomplexity. He suggested that they are \u2015too large\u2026 not tailored to the measurements of the \nreality in which we live\u2016 (1963: 1\/1254; cited in Mackay 2007: 7). While this certainly appears \nlike a rejection of dialectical thinking in its entirety, thinking through the nature of the \nobjection is illuminating. While still problematic, Deleuze\u2018s complaint is certainly a more \nuseful formulation than the suggestion that \u2017eagles don\u2018t catch flies\u2018\u2016 (see Woodward et. al. \n2007). It is useful because it opens up the question of what precisely it is that dialectics are \nsupposedly inadequate to, what they fail to grasp. \n \nThe question it opens up is whether there is an issue of scale: dialectics is too big, and the \nworld more complicated and shot through with detail and particularity. This is what Bergson \nseems to be invoking with the notion of tailoring our concepts to \u2015measurements of the \nreality in which we live\u2016. Yet it is not at all clear that Deleuze or Bergson would be content \nwith what might be called a micro-dialectics, operating with finer particles. There are flaws \nwith the process as much as the design. But shared both by dialectics and this critique are a \nnumber of assumptions. Three key issues or questions arise from this. \n \n1. The first is the question of how well dialectics enable us to deal with the world \u2013 as it is, \nin its complexity, with its measurements, in its reality. \n2. But we should also ask whether this is something we actually want \u2013 do we know how \nthe world is, its reality; and is its complexity something we want to measure? \n3. Or, alternatively, can this work help us to understand the problems of a static, \nmeasurable world, one that can be reduced to the claim that it is fundamentally \nknowable? This raises some important questions about the nature of measure more \ngenerally. \n 8 \n \nThe relation of dialectics to the world is perhaps most fully worked through in Engels\u2018 book \nDialectics of Nature (1940). Yet this book, which was one of the key inspirations for the \ndialectical materialism, or \u2017diamat,\u2018 of the officially sanctioned philosophy of Marxist-\nLeninism, diverges from Marx himself. It is important to remember that Marx never actually \nused the words \u2017dialectical materialism\u2018, nor did he follow up the plan he outlined to Engels \nof writing \u2015two or three printer\u2018s sheets [of about 16 pages each]\u2016 on the dialectical \nmethodology (Marx and Engels 1983: 249). Lenin remarks in his Philosophical Notebooks that \nMarx may not have left us with a Logic of his own, on the model of Hegel, but he did leave \nthe logic of Capital (1963: 361). While later versions of \u2017Marxism\u2018 supplemented it with extra \nelements--Engels, Lenin, Kautsky and others--the issue is whether they were developments \nwithin its system or changes to it.  \n \nThe question of materiality is another key concern here. Materiality and the new geographies \nof it has received a good deal of attention recently (see, for example, Anderson and Tolia \nKelly eds. 2004). This is a materiality that goes beyond mere materialism, or, at least, crude \nmechanism. Lefebvre once remarked that a Marxist dialectician would prefer an \u2015intelligent \nidealism\u2016 to a \u2015stupid materialism\u2016 (1960: 17), which remains sound advice. Nonetheless the \nway that materiality matters to dialectics was not always clear in these papers. For although \nMarx did not use the term \u2017dialectical materialism\u2018, he did advocate a historical materialism. \nFor David Harvey and others the aim of a Marxist geography has been to introduce another \nterm into this, producing a \u2017historical-and-geographical materialism\u2018 \u2013 or, perhaps better than \n 9 \n\u2017producing\u2018, making obvious what was previously neglected.4 Yet while Harvey remains \nattentive to the relation between history and geography, demonstrating the benefits of this, \nfor example, in his A Brief History of Neoliberalism (2005), others do not always follow this \nlead.5 The question of history and, in particular, the history of ideas, seems to me to be one \nof the key issues in theoretical work in geography today, perhaps even more when historical \nmaterialist\u2014dialectical or not\u2014accounts are offered. \n \nOne of the crucial questions that follows from all this is whether dialectics is a way of \nunderstanding nature and the material world, or whether we think that the world operates \ndialectically in itself, and that this is why dialectics enables an understanding. It is this \nquestion that I want to pursue here, by looking at two nondialectical materialist thinkers, the \nFrench philosophers Alain Badiou and Quentin Meillassoux. Thinking through their work \nexplicitly confronts the question of mathematics and that of the world. \n \nThe Return of Mathematics: A Rejection of Dialectics? \nIt seems notable that mathematics and its relation to philosophy is making something of a \nreturn in human geography, and yet not as a straight-forward rerun of the quantitative \nrevolution. Some of this is in terms of an interrogation of the wider issues of calculation \u2013 \nthe geography of mathematics, rather than the mathematics of geography (see, for example, \n                                                 \n4  The classic text for this is Harvey 1982. \n5  Another successful proponent of this approach would be Neil Smith, in 2005, and, \nespecially, 2003. \n 10 \nthe special issues of key geography journals: Philo ed. 1998; Barnes and Hannah eds. 2001a, \n2001b; Crampton and Elden eds. 2006).  \n \nYet there is also something rather different happening. Sheppard notes that, \n\u2015notwithstanding tendencies among \u2017critical\u2018 human geographers to dismiss quantitative \napproaches as tainted by positivism and neoclassical economics, the domains of mathematics \nassociated with nonlinear and complex systems have turned out to be pertinent for \ndialectical, postmodern and assemblage ontologies\u2016 (Sheppard 2008: 14; see Bergmann, \nSheppard, and Plummer, forthcoming). Martin Jones\u2018 important work on \u2015phase space\u2016 \n(2009), working through insights in Henri Poincar\u00e9, is another symptom of this engagement. \nIn her paper Susan Ruddick raises the issue of the relation between mathematics and \nmetaphysics, two modes of though she claims that seventeenth century natural philosophy \ndid not strictly distinguish (2008: 9). She illustrates this through a careful reading of Spinoza \nagainst Hegel\u2018s (mis)interpretation, inspired by Pierre Macherey\u2018s Hegel ou Spinoza (Ruddick \n2008; Macherey 1977). Spinoza\u2018s two non-concentric circles are given as a model of \u2015how \nthe infinite expresses itself fully in the finite as a positivity\u2016 (Ruddick 2008: 8). \n \nWhile Barbara Hooper\u2018s paper operates in a rather different register, with its careful \nexcavation of the Greek heritage of dialectics, it too invokes the question of mathematics. In \nthis case it raises the important issue of the relation of mathematics to bodies. She cites \nJacob Klein\u2018s important work, Greek Mathematical Thought and the Origin of Algebra, noting that \n\u2015we first acquire the \u2017art of number\u2018(arithmetike) in our \u2017intercourse with objects of daily life\u2018\u2016 \n(Klein 1992: 18; Hooper 2008: 14). She goes on to suggest that number is a \u2015form of \n\u2017ontological mathematics\u2018\u2016 (Hooper 2008: 14). This is close to Badiou\u2018s claim that ontology \n 11 \nis mathematics: a question that needs to be interrogated textually, politically and theoretically. \nIndeed I would suggest that the growing interest in Badiou within human geography is \nperhaps the most significant example of this mathematical trend. While Badiou was only \nmentioned briefly by Doel and Ruddick in this collection of papers (Doel 2008: 18, 19; \nRuddick 2008: 1, 2), he is beginning to receive attention within geography more widely (see \nDewsbury 2007; Saldanha 2007; Doel 2009).6 \n \nThe interest in these issues, and in Badiou in particular, invites questions of the capacity, \ncomplexity and complicity of mathematics. What can mathematics do, and in particular what \ndoes this embrace of number, calculation, geometry and other branches of mathematics, \nsuch as set theory, allow us to do that we could not otherwise? How does this actually sit in \nterms of the appropriation of complex thinkers? And, most troublingly, what does this \nembrace of Badiou buy into, and are we aware of and willing to accept its associations?  \n \nThe reason for there being some caution concerning the appropriation of Badiou is, in part, \nbecause of a particular way in which he is being read. This goes back to the question of easy \nappropriation and eliding of differences. This can either be through a cursory use of the \ntheoretical works, or a utilisation of the more explicitly political works, such as Polemics \n(2006c) or The Century (2007) without relating them to their essential context in the \narguments of his more theoretical works. Badiou\u2018s major work L\u2019\u00eatre et l\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nement (1988) is \n                                                 \n6  A forthcoming issue of Environment and Planning D: Society and Space contains a theme \nsection on Badiou\u2018s work, including \u2015Being and Spatialization: An interview with \nAlain Badiou by Marios Constantinou and Norman Madarasz\u2016. \n 12 \none of the most formidably difficult texts of recent times, one that bears comparison of \ncomplexity with works of Kant, Hegel and Heidegger. The recent English translation Being \nand Event (2005a) confirmed impressions that it was a matter of difficulty of content rather \nthan of expression. Its second volume, Logiques du monde (2006a), develops and complicates \nmany of its claims. Let us be cautious about it and not make hasty use of his work.  \n \nThe interest in Badiou by theoretically minded geographers seems to me to be problematic \nfor a number of reasons, but not least because what Badiou says seems to unravel many of \nthe more carefully won victories of a rigorous, theoretically informed geography that does \nnot aspire to be a spatial (or social) science. In particular, Badiou\u2018s use of mathematics opens \nup a number of tensions with thinkers such as Heidegger and Foucault, for instance, who are \ncritical of the ways in which calculation dominates the modern epoch.7 Badiou\u2018s mathematics \nis, of course, a very different form of mathematics, based on set theory, but it still pushes \nphilosophy into a subordinate position. Badiou declares that if \u2015we abstract all presentative \npredicates little by little, we are left with the multiple, pure and simple\u2026 being-as-being, \nbeing as pure multiplicity \u2013 can be thought only through mathematics\u2016 (2001: 127). \n \nThus philosophy, for Badiou, must humble itself \u2015before mathematics by acknowledging \nthat mathematics is in effect the thinking of pure being, of being qua being\u2016 (1998: 38). If it \ndoes this, then \u2015philosophy unburdens itself of what appears to be its highest responsibility: \nit asserts that it is not up to it to think being qua being\u2016 (1998: 55). Geographers have \n                                                 \n7  I\u2018ve tried to work through some problems in terms of Badiou and his engagement \nwith Heidegger in the final pages of my book Speaking Against Number (Elden 2006).  \n 13 \nstruggled for a long time against the scientific pretensions of parts of the discipline, and so it \nwould be particularly ironic if the \u2017new theory\u2018 brought this back at an even more \nfundamental level. Set theory is, even in complex forms, difficult to reconcile with the range \nof theoretical interests of contemporary geography. For Badiou expressly sees his project as \nconcerning the relation between nature and number and, therefore, in part as a development \nand extension of Galileo\u2018s claim that nature is written in \u2015mathematical language\u2016 (2005a: \n140). He is avowedly Cartesian, even as he posits a post-metaphysical \u2015speculative \nmaterialism\u2016. In addition, it is difficult to reconcile his work with any meaningful account of \ndialectics. When he talks about the dialectic at all, it is in a form that seems wilfully distorted. \nBadiou claims, for instance,  that a \u2015materialist dialectic\u2016 should be opposed to what he calls \n\u2015democratic materialism\u2016. Democratic materialism suggests that \u2015there are only bodies and \nlanguages\u2016; to which materialist dialectics replies that \u2015there are only bodies and languages, \nexcept that there are truths\u2016 (2006a: 9, 12). For Badiou, the dialectic is the syntax or logic of \nthe only\/except, or more fully: \u2015there are only\u2026 except that there are [Il n\u2019y a que\u2026 sinon \nqu\u2019il il y a]\u2016. He claims that \u2015this syntax indicates that it is a matter neither of an addition \n(truths as simple supplements of bodies and languages), nor of a synthesis (truths as the self-\nrevelation of bodies grasped by languages). Truths exist as exceptions to what there is\u2016 \n(2006a: 12). In Logiques du monde, this is used as a basis for an incorporation of Descartes into \nhis overall project, which he ties to the project of Being and Event which outlined an embrace \nof truths as \u2015generic multiplicities\u2016 (2006a: 15).8 Dialectics quickly becomes didactics (2006a: \n17). \n \n                                                 \n8\n  Most of the opening pages of this book appear in English as 2006e. See also 2005b. \n 14 \nWe can see the consequences of this mathematicisation of truth and existence perhaps \nparticularly clearly in the work of Badiou\u2018s former student Quentin Meillassoux. In his recent \nbook Apr\u00e8s la finitude, prefaced and endorsed by Badiou, Meillasoux argues for a dismissal of \na belief in \u2017correlationism\u2018 (2006: 18). Correlationism is described as the thesis that things we \nobserve are dependent on the observer in some fundamental ways, or more fundamentally, \nthat humans and the world coexist. There is a necessary correlation between what is \nobserved and that which observes. Subjectivity and objectivity cannot be thought \nindependently (2006: 18-19). One way in which this is stated is Heidegger\u2018s notion of being-\nin-the-world. Not a world that first exists, and then has beings in it; nor a being who exists \nand then exists in the world; but an essential interrelation between them. Correlationism \ndoes not deny an absolute reality, but recognises that it is always mediated for us through the \nperception of it. This a model of knowledge that can be traced back to Kant, and then \npermeates the continental European tradition which produces so many of the thinkers \ngeographers have found so influential. More broadly it underpins attempts to recognise a \nhuman element in a material ontology. The contemporary critique of representation within \ngeography can be understood as part of this movement of thought. Correlationism is neither \nan atheism or a religious perspective, but an agnostic one: the only world that exists for us is \nthe world as it is known to us. It thus differs from the \u2017Galilean-Cartesian-Newtonian-\nDarwinian\u2018 view that science can tell us about the world as it actually is (see Milbank 2007). \n \nMeillassoux takes one particular example to challenge the problems of this way of thinking. \nThese are what he calls arche-fossils, radioactive traces of what can be proven to have \nexisted before there was anything that would have perceived that existence. The universe is \n13.5 billion years old; the earth 4.45 billion; life on earth 3.5 billion; human origins a mere 2 \n 15 \nmillion (2006: 24). While philosophers have claimed that this is \u2015an unexpected new \nbattlefield for continental thought\u2016 (Harman 2007: 104), in a sense this is a geologic or \nphysical geographical challenge to human geography. There is a world of which we can have \nobjective knowledge without their being any mediation between the knowledge and the \nobserver, except at a several million year interval. While the explicit dating is meditated, the \nexistence of these phenomena is not. Meillassoux is unimpressed with the response that \nthere are many things that are unperceived that we still accept exist. For him this is a much \nmore fundamental challenge than one that can be dismissed by the argument that \nmanifestation always has absences or lacunae; rather these are things completely exterior to \nthe range of manifestation. It is thus not a question of the finitude of perception, that is, its \nintrinsic limitations, but a problem prior to the advent of perception. As Brassier puts it, it is \nnot therefore \u2015merely a non-manifest gap or lacuna in manifestation; it is the lacuna of \nmanifestation tout court\u2016 (2007: 25). Meillassoux suggests that correlationism, in all its \nvariants, is a convenient way of avoiding having to account for the world as it is, prior to \nhuman access. In response it is tempting here to recall Heidegger\u2018s riposte to Kant. Kant \nthought it a failure that we could not account for the existence of things outside of us \nwithout falling back on our own existence [Dasein]. Heidegger thought this distinction \nneeded to be collapsed. The \u2017scandal of philosophy\u2018 is not that there has been a failure to \nprovide a proof for the existence of the external world, but rather \u2015that such proofs are expected \nand attempted again and again\u2016 (1962: 205). \n \nMeillassoux closes his book with the thought that while Kant may have been awoken from \nhis \u2017dogmatic slumbers\u2018 by reading Hume, perhaps today we need to be shaken from our \nstraight-forward rendering of the world and its relation to the human, which he calls \u2015our \n 16 \ncorrelationist slumbers\u2016 (2006: 178). Meillassoux, following Badiou, claims that mathematics \ndescribes the world as it was, in what he calls the ancestral sphere or realm, and as it is (2006: \n16, 37, 158 and passim).9 Mathematics then is not a way of describing the world as it appears \nto us, but a mode of access to the world in itself. This is a mode of relation to the absolute, \n\u2015reality in itself apart from any relation to humans\u2016 (Harman 2007: 104). This trajectory of \nthought is, therefore, a thorough going critique of the critique of representation. \nMeillassoux\u2018s claim is simply stated: \u2015\u2026 everything concerning the object that can be \nformulated in mathematical terms can be rightly conceived as properties of the object in \nitself\u2016 (2006: 16). He takes the set theory elaborated by Badiou and the analysis of \nprobability of Vernes (1982) to begin to describe this (2006: 130-1; see also Meillassoux \n2004). He suggests that this means that there is now a certainty that there is no causal \nnecessity. Whereas previous claims have simply been sceptical about this, now this can be \nstated absolutely. While apparently contradictory, the only thing that is necessary is that there \nis no necessity; hence his claim that contingency is necessary. Thus the title of his book \u2013 \nAfter Finitude: An Essay on the Necessity of Contingency. As Badiou puts it, Meillassoux \n\u2015establishes that only a sole thing is absolutely necessary: that the laws of nature are \ncontingent\u2016 (2006b: 10). That contingency can be analysed mathematically. As Harman puts \nit: \u2015the essential criteria of all mathematical statements will be transformed into necessary \nconditions of the contingency of every being\u2016 (2007: 108). \n                                                 \n9  As Harman notes, \u2015the ancestral realm in his work still functions solely as a \nmechanism for absolutizing the correlational circle: indeed, his method of obtaining \nthe absolute arises directly from a radicalization of the correlational predicament \nitself\u2016 (2007: 116). \n 17 \n \nWhile the charge is powerful and the case he makes for their being a problem compelling, \nthe consequences of his solution would, in their mathematical bias, unravel much of what \npasses for theorizing in contemporary human geography. Badiou sees Meillassoux\u2018s work as \nan entirely complicit development of his work, even as he accords it a stature and \nimportance of its own (see 2006b; and particularly 2006a: 129, 589; 2006d: 17). Taking on \nBadiou may force some uncomfortable liaisons. Meillassoux himself has noted that a reader \ncan agree with the critique of correlationism without having to accept his own solution.10 It \nwould be possible, for instance, to have grave doubts about the claim that knowledge is \nalways filtered through human experience without thinking that mathematics escapes that \nmediation.11 But it is the solution, rather than simply the critique, that Badiou endorses. \nThose invoking the name of Badiou need to be clear about whether they embrace the \nmathematical aspects of his work, or whether they contest them. If the latter, then the onus \nis on them to show how the politics or whatever else they find worthwhile can be separated \nfrom the ontology. This is not a move that Badiou would willingly concede, and his own \nwritings, along with those of Meillassoux, illustrate the very real challenges this provides. We \nshould not assume that quite different thinkers can be reconciled without very real problems, \ntensions and negotiations. \n \n                                                 \n10  Meillassoux, email to Graham Harman, 9 June 2006, cited in Harman 2007: 117 n. 4.  \n11  For a more fully worked through critique, which takes issue both with the \ninterpretation of Kant and the consequences drawn from it, see Kerslake 2008, \nChapter Four. \n 18 \nConcluding Thoughts \nMeillassoux is explicit about his aim being, \u2015that of building a materialism \u2013 or a realism \u2013 \nable to refute clearly the correlational circle in its simplest form, which is also the form \nwhich is the most difficult to fight with\u2016 (Meillassoux in Brassier et. al. 2007: 426). Three key \npoints need to be stressed here: the equation of materialism and realism; the opposition of \nboth to a critique of representation; and the non-dialectical, but rather mathematical, nature \nof this materialism or realism. Indeed, its temporal bias may have even deeper implications: \nlargely aspatial, it depends on a non-dialectical linear teleology. \n \nThe return of mathematical ordering, not merely in terms of a way of understanding the \nworld, but as a suggestion that this is actually how the world is, is one that should be \ncontested. Only a recognition that mathematics appears suspect, and a rejection of some \nlineages in order to pursue others, such as that articulated by Ruddick where she suggests an \n\u2015emergent rather than axiomatic\u2016 mathematics, can begin to escape this (2008: 9). Dialectical \nthinking, which was so important in the first turn away from quantitative geography, may be \na viable alternative. While previously this was a turn toward Marxism, this is perhaps \nparticularly the case today if this dialectics is reworked in conversation with post-\nstructuralism. This is not an either\/or choice: one could conceivable reject both mathematics \nand dialectics. But if we return to Bergson, and Deleuze\u2018s gloss, perhaps we can see that \ndialectics, understood in some of the ways outlined in these papers, can help us to grasp the \nworld in its becoming, with its complexities, yet without reducing it to the coordinates of a \nreality we are already predisposed to know how to measure. We should not take the limits of \nour grasp of the world as the limits of the world. Dialectics might help us to make sense of \nthe world without thinking that nature operates dialectically. \n 19 \n \nThe more powerful way of stating this is that dialectics might be one of the ways in which \nwe can understand the problems of a world understood as measurable, one that can be \nreduced to the claim that it is fundamentally knowable. This seems to be at least part of the \nchallenge of Meillassoux. But are we willing to embrace mathematics as the solution to this \nproblem? Like Simonsen (2004), I am concerned about the resurrection of a particular \ngeometrical form of argument, following in the wake of Deleuze\u2018s appropriations of Spinoza \nand Leibniz, and now Badiou. Can dialectics, perhaps reformulated, provide an alternative?  \n \n\u2017Traditional\u2018 dialectics cannot remain unchanged, and to develop and supplement it is surely \npermissible. It may benefit, today as in the past, from the introduction of other ideas. This is \none of Lefebvre\u2018s key insights, and something that is developed in these papers. The \nproductive collision between post-structuralism and traditional dialectics, outlined by \nSheppard and pursued in differing ways through most of the papers here is one way forward. \nProviding that this appropriation is not \u2017pick n\u2018 mix\u2018 theorizing, of course, and that it \nundertakes the careful and detailed work of reading and analyzing complex thinkers, this \nplurality is one of the more invigorating currents of contemporary geography. Anything less \nthan an openness to change would, of course, be profoundly undialectical. \n \n 20 \nReferences \nArrighi G. (1994) The Long Twentieth Century .
