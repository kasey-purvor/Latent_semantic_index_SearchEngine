It is large and complex but appears to consist of only ~30 different \nproteins despite its mass of >60 MDa. Vertebrate NPC structure has been analyzed by \nseveral methods giving a comprehensive architectural model. Despite our knowledge \nof yeast nucleoporins, structural data is more limited and suggests the basic \norganization is similar to vertebrates, but may lack some peripheral and other \ncomponents. Using field emission scanning electron microscopy to probe NPC \nstructure we found that the yeast, like higher eukaryotic, NPCs contain similar \nperipheral components. We can detect cytoplasmic rings and evidence of \nnucleoplasmic rings in yeasts. A filamentous basket is present on the nucleoplasmic \nface and evidence for cytoplasmic filaments is shown. We observe a central structure, \npossibly the transporter, that which may be linked to the cytoplasmic ring by internal \nfilaments. Immuno-gold labeling suggests that Nup159p may be attached to the \ncytoplasmic ring, whereas Nup116p may be associated, partly, with the cytoplasmic \nfilaments. Analysis of a Nup57p mutant suggested a role in maintaining the stability \nof cytoplasmic components of the NPC. We conclude that peripheral NPC \ncomponents appear similar in yeasts compared to higher organisms and present a \nrevised model for yeast NPC structural composition. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4 \nIntroduction  \n \nNuclear pore complexes (NPCs) mediate the exchange of macromolecules across the \nnuclear envelope (NE).  Various soluble transport factors carry substrates to the NPC, \nwhere they interact with nucleoporins and mediate translocation through the NPC in \nspecific directions (Mattaj and Englmeier, 1998; Adam, 1999; Talcott and Moore, \n1999; Rout and Aitchison, 1999; Allen et al., 2000; Vasu and Forbes, 2001)  \n \nThe NPCs are located in pores created by the fusion of the inner and outer nuclear \nmembranes (Goldbeg et al ., 1999; Stoffler et al., 1999; Kiseleva et al., 2000). In \nvertebrates (Hinshaw et al., 1992; Akey and Radermacher, 1992; Goldberg and Allen, \n1992) and invertebrates\n \n(Kiseleva et al., 1998) the center of the pore consists of a disc, \ntermed the inner spoke ring, which has a central aperture in which is located a \ncylindrical structure called the transporter. The inner spoke ring has eight extensions \noutwards through the pore membrane into the NE lumen. The two known vertebrate \nintegral membrane nucleoporins, POM121 and gp210, may form part of this trans-\nmembrane domain. These trans-membrane domains join together in the lumen to form \nthe radial arms.  \n \nIn vertebrates, on the cytoplasmic face, above the level of the membrane, is an eight \nsubunit ring (Hinshaw et al., 1992; Akey and Radermacher, 1992; Goldberg and \nAllen, 1992). The ring consists of at least three sequential components: (1) the star \nring which lies on and is embedded in the membrane; (2) the thin ring which lies on \ntop of the star ring and then (3) eight bipartite subunits that are molded onto the thin \nring (Goldberg and Allen, 1992).The star ring has only been detected by field \nemission scanning electron microscopy (feSEM) (Goldberg and Allen, 1996)\n \nand may \nform part of the cytoplasmic ring and transmembrane vertical domains seen in 3D \nreconstructions (Akey and Radermacher, 1993), as the tips of its triangular shaped \nsubunits appear to be embedded in the membrane. Filaments extend from the \ncytoplasmic ring into the cytoplasm and contain the Ran binding protein Nup358 (Wu \net al., 1995; Delphin et al., 1997; Walther and Pickersgill et al., 2002). They appear to \nhave controlled dynamics\n \n(Goldberg et al., 2000), but are not essential in at least some \nnuclear transport pathways (Walther and Pickersgill et al., 2002).  \n \nFilaments extending from the cytoplasmic ring into the center of the NPC have also \nbeen observed by feSEM\n \n(Kiseleva et al., 1998; Goldberg and Allen, 1996).These \n\u201cinternal filaments\u201d could link the cytoplasmic ring to the central transporter. Nup214 \nand Nup62 and their interacting nucleoporins localize to this central region\n \nGuan et \nal., 1995; Grote at al., 1995). These proteins contain FG repeat domains, which \ninteract with transport factors and may play a direct role in guiding the substrates \nthrough the NPC (Rout and Aitchison, 2001; Ribbeck and Gorlich., 2001).  \n \nThe central transporter, which is a cylinder with a central aperture (Akey and \nRadermacher, 1993) traverses the NPC and is therefore a major channel between the \nnuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. The central aperture appears to open and \nclose which offers a possible control mechanism for transport (Kiseleva et al., 1998; \nAkey, 1990; Feldherr et al., 2001). However, the transporter remains a controversial \ncomponent, believed to be an artifact by some, and there is some evidence that it is \nnot always present (Stoffler et al., 2003).  \n \n 5 \nOn the nucleoplasmic side there is a peripheral ring structure similar to the star ring. \nAttached to this is a fishtrap- (Ris, 1991) or basket-like structure (Goldberg and Allen, \n1992), consisting of eight filaments which join together at the distal basket ring. \n \nThe 3D structure of unfixed isolated yeast NPCs (Yang et al., 1998), rapidly frozen \nand embedded in amorphous ice showed that the core of the yeast structure (the inner \nspoke ring, transmembrane domain and transporter) was very similar to the vertebrate \nstructure. However, the cytoplasmic ring and filaments and the nucleoplasmic ring \nand basket were not evident, although weak densities of some structures were \ndetected in these regions. Thin section TEM has been used to demonstrate that \nfilaments are attached to both sides of the NPC in yeast, and that there is probably a \nnucleoplasmic basket (Fahrenkrog et al., 1998; Rout and Blobel, 1992). However, the \nextent of conservation of NPC structure between yeast and higher eukaryotes remains \nuncertain. The 2D projection maps and 3D structures have been calculated from \ntransmitted images of isolated yeast NPCs (Yang et al., 1998). Although this strategy \nhas provided a wealth of information concerning the 3D architecture particularly of \nthe core of the structure, the structures were calculated from many individual NPCs to \ngive a reasonable signal to noise ratio. Therefore, the methods could be biased against \nstructural components that are variable between NPCs or which are flexible and hence \ndo not occupy a clearly defined position. Such structural components would be \npredicted from the protein composition of the NPC, which includes several proteins \nwhich appear to be \u201cmobile\u201d in vertebrates (Nakielny et al., 1999; Griffis et al., 2002) \nand in yeast (Dilworth et al., 2001; Denning et al., 2001). It is also possible that \nisolation of NPCs, necessary for these structural studies could disrupt particularly \nperipheral components. \n \nBecause of the experimental advantages of yeast, it is important to determine in finer \ndetail the yeast NPC architecture. FeSEM can be used to image individual NPCs at a \nresolution comparable to 3D TEM reconstructions (Allen et al., 1997). FeSEM \ntherefore complements the 3D structure of the core obtained by TEM and provides \ninformation on the more variable flexible components found at the periphery of the \nNPC. Although cryo-TEM showed weak peripheral densities, that were consistent \nwith peripheral structures (Yang et al., 1998), which are also seen in thin sections, \nhere we directly demonstrate that these peripheral structures, such as the basket and \ninternal filaments, appear to be very similar to those in vertebrates and other \norganisms. \n \nThe yeast NPC is formed from a series of distinct nucleoporin complexes, each of \nwhich may contribute substructure to the NPC. Several nucleoporin subcomplexes \nhave been identified (Grandi et al., 1993; Grandi et al., 1995a; Grandi et al., 1995b; \nNehrbass et al., 1996; Zabel et al., 1996; Siniossoglou et al., 1996; Iovine et al., 1997; \nBailer et al., 1998; Belgareh et al., 1998; Marelli et al., 1998; Lutzmann et al., 2002).  \nDifferent nucleoporins have been localised to distinct substructures of both the \nvertebrate and yeast NPCs (reviewed in Stoffler et al., 1999; Doye and Hurt, 1997; \nRout et al., 2000).   \n  \nIn this report we further resolve the structure of NPC substructures in the \nevolutionarily diverse yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces \npombe by combining new methods for isolation of nuclei with feSEM. We \ndemonstrate that in both yeast types, cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic NPC \n 6 \ncompartments are comprised of similar individual components that are inherent to \nvertebrate NPCs.  Immuno-feSEM suggests that Nup159p maybe part of the \ncytoplasmic ring whereas Nup116p could be partly associated with the cytoplasmic \nfilaments. Finally we found that the loss of Nup57p in a temperature sensitive mutant \ncorrelates with striking perturbations of the NPC structure at the cytoplasmic face of \nthe NE. This further refinement of both wild type and mutant yeast NPC structure is \nnecessary to couple yeast genetic and biochemical analysis of NPC function with the \nstructural architecture.  \n \nRESULTS  \n \nNPC numbers \n \nNuclei were isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells by one of two protocols \n(Fig. 1): from spheroplasts (Fig. 1b,e,g) or by a freeze-grinding technique (Fig. 1 \nc,d,f) (Materials and Methods). These two methods gave essentially the same results, \nand thus Schizosaccharomyces pombe nuclei were only isolated from spheroplasts \n(Fig. 2). NPCs were difficult to make out amongst the densely packed ribosomes, \nespecially in S. cerevisiae (Fig. 1a). Therefore ribosomes were partially dissociated \nwith 0.3M NaCl, which resulted in clearly visible NPCs (Figs. 1b-g). The NPCs often \nappeared in clusters of 3-20 (circled in Fig. 1b), consistent with a previous TEM thin \nsection study (Winey et al., 1997). \n \nThe NPCs in nuclei prepared from S. pombe were similar to those from S. cerevisiae \n(Fig. 2) but were more easily detected amongst the ribosomes (circled in Fig. 2b). The \nnumber of NPCs per nucleus ranged from about 20 to about 40 on the region of the \nnucleus accessed by feSEM possibly reflecting that cells were at different stages of \nthe cell cycle. These results are in agreement with studies analyzing NPC numbers \nand distribution in reconstructions of serially sectioned yeast cells (Winey et al., \n1997). \n \nYeast NPCs have a cytoplasmic ring \n \nThe structural organization of the NPC was similar in samples prepared either from \nspheroplasts (Figs.1b,e,g) or by the freeze-grinding technique (Figs. 1c,d,f). The \nstructure was also similar in budding and fission yeasts (Figs 1 and 2, respectively). \nNPCs have a diameter of ~ 95nm, in the feSEM, which is consistent with 3D \nreconstructions of frozen-hydrated yeast NPCs (Yang et al., 1998) and smaller than \nXenopus oocytes NPCs (110-120nm) visualized by the feSEM (Goldberg and Allen, \n1996).  \n \nIn feSEM images there was a bulky cytoplasmic ring structure (Fig. 1b-g), which \nprojected above the level of the outer nuclear membrane. The ring appeared to consist \nof at least two components, which are shown and illustrated in the insets in Fig. 1c.  \n \nFirstly, and most clearly, are eight bulky subunits (Fig. 1c, numbered in the bottom \ninset and gray in the cartoon) which appear to be equivalent to the cytoplasmic ring \nsubunits in Xenopus oocytes NPCs (see Fig.7 for comparison). These subunits are \nabove the level of the membrane, which can be seen most clearly when the NPCs are \ntilted with respect to the axis of view (e.g. arrow Fig.1b). In addition, extra brightness \n 7 \naround the edge of these particles shows that they have topographical contrast, and \ntherefore are not at the level on the membrane. This is important because it shows that \nthis structure cannot be part of the spoke complex which only extends to the level of \nthe outer nuclear membrane in yeast (Yang et al., 1998) and in Xenopus (Akey and \nRadermacher, 1993; Goldberg and Allen, 1993). Therefore we believe that they are \nsubunits of the cytoplasmic ring. The finding that yeast NPCs have a cytoplasmic ring \nis significant because although the previous 3D reconstruction data (Yang et al., 1998) \nshowed some density in this region, it did not show a definitive ring structure \nconsisting of subunits. The peripheral density could therefore have been interpreted as \nother peripheral structures such as filaments being attached directly to the spoke ring \ncomplex (accounting for the extra peripheral density). FeSEM data, in contrast, \nsuggest that the cytoplasmic filaments or particles are, like in Xenopus, attached to \nbulky cytoplasmic ring subunits. Additional cytoplasmic filaments\/particles are \nobserved attached to these ring subunits (Fig.1c and d, small arrows and Fig.7). \n \nThe reason for this discrepancy is not clear but is likely to be related to one or more of \nthe following, which vary between the current and the previous (Yang et al., 1998)  \nstudies:  \n1) isolation of the NPCs (here NPCs are left within the intact isolated nucleus, \nwhereas previously NPCs were isolated);  \n2) processing for imaging (here they are fixed and critical point dried, whereas \npreviously they were viewed unfixed, frozen hydrated);  \n3) the imaging itself (surface imaging by feSEM compared to projection imaging).  \n \nBecause cytoplasmic rings were previously observed in TEM reconstructions in \nXenopus (Hinshaw et al., 1992; Akey and Radermacher, 1993) it is unlikely that the \nimaging method could cause this discrepancy.  It is possible that the fixation and \ndrying used here could cause collapse and aggregation of peripheral structures to form \nsubunit like structures similar to the Xenopus cytoplasmic ring. We do not favor this \ninterpretation because of the apparent similarity in the structure observed here by \nfeSEM compared to that observed in Xenopus by both feSEM and cryo-TEM. We \nfavor the interpretation that when NPCs are isolated (Yang et al., 1998) there may be \nsome disruption or disordering of the ring structure, which may preclude the detection \nof a defined ring and the resolution of individual subunits. It may be that the density \ndetected in this region in 3D reconstructions (Yang et al., 1998) can be attributed to \ndisordered rings and\/or cytoplasmic filaments that have collapsed onto them to \ndiffering degrees. However, confirmation of the cytoplasmic ring in yeast will require \nits observation by an alternative method, particularly of sample preparation. To this \nend we are currently developing methods to examine frozen samples by feSEM. \n \nThin section TEM studies also suggest a structural similarity between yeast and \nvertebrates in this region, particularly the presence of cytoplasmic filaments, but \ncould not demonstrate the presence of rings (Fahrenkrog et al., 1998; Rout and \nBlobel, 1993; Allen and Douglas, 1989). \n \nThe size of these putative yeast cytoplasmic ring subunits is also not strikingly \ndifferent from Xenopus oocyte cytoplasmic ring subunits at about 25nm across (Fig.7 \nand Goldberg and Allen, 1993). \n \n 8 \nThe second component of the cytoplasmic ring that was observed is the \u201cthin ring\u201d. \nThe thin ring underlies the cytoplasmic ring subunits and is observed in Xenopus in \n3D reconstructions (Akey and Radermacher, 1993), by feSEM after partial proteolysis \n(Goldberg and Allen, 1996) and as a putative assembly intermediate in Xenopus egg \nextracts and Drosophila early embryos (Goldberg and Wiese et al., 1997; Kiseleva et \nal., 2001). As with other specimens, the thin ring in yeast is difficult to detect in intact \nNPCs. However, sometimes glimpses of a structure consistent with the thin ring can \nbe observed between two cytoplasmic ring subunits (arrows in the bottom inset in Fig. \n1c and colored black in the cartoon in the upper inset). A similar structure is also seen \nin S. pombe (Fig.2d, arrow). We have also observed a consistent structure in putative \nincomplete NPCs (see below), which could be the thin ring without the cytoplasmic \nring subunits (Fig.3f and 5b), although it remains to be shown for certain that these \nare NPC-related substructures. We suggest therefore that, like Xenopus, yeasts too \nhave a thin ring, which is an integral part of the cytoplasmic ring.  \n \nYeast NPCs appear to have cytoplasmic particles or filaments \n \nIn S. cerevisae a variable number of globular particles were found attached to the \ncytoplasmic ring subunits (Fig. 1d and e, small arrows). It was possible that these \nwere the cytoplasmic filaments. In nuclei isolated from S. pombe without 0.3M NaCl, \nthese putative cytoplasmic filaments were more consistently present and had a more \nextended conformation, appearing more like a rod or filament than a particle (Fig. 2f). \nThe filaments could be quite extended (Fig. 2f and g, marked \u201c1\u201d) or more compact \n(marked \u201c2\u201d and \u201c3\u201d), which was reminiscent of the apparent conformational \nflexibility observed in vertebrates (Goldberg et al., 2000; Pante and Aebi, 1996; \nRutherford et al., 1997). \n \nSuch filaments emanating from the cytoplasmic face of the yeast NPC have \npreviously been suggested from structures observed in TEM thin sections (Fahrenkrog \net al., 1998; Rout and Blobel, 1993). The thin section data together with our \nobservation of globular or extended particles attached to the cytoplasmic ring suggests \nthat both yeasts have equivalent cytoplasmic filaments to vertebrates, although it \nremains to be shown directly whether there are extensive filaments that attach to the \ncytoplasmic ring and extend some distance into the cytoplasm. \n \nCentral NPC structures \n \nAs feSEM is a surface imaging method it is most suited for visualizing peripheral \nstructures. However, more internal components of the NPC can be detected when \nNPCs are incomplete, either during assembly (Goldberg and Wiese et al., 1997; \nKiseleva et al., 2001) or when they are fractured (Kiseleva et al., 1998; Goldberg and \nAllen, 1996). These structures include the putative transporter, the inner spoke ring \nand the internal filaments. We have found evidence for these central core structures in \nyeast (Fig. 3). \n \nThe evidence for these structures comes from images of nuclei that have structures on \ntheir cytoplasmic membrane surface, which are consistent with previously identified \nvertebrate putative assembly intermediates and fractured NPCs, as well as structures \nthat are consistent with components identified in thin ice reconstructions (Yang et al., \n1998). These structures could be assembly intermediates or they could be fractured \n 9 \nNPCs, that have lost certain peripheral components to reveal underlying structure, and \nwe shall refer to them as \u201cintermediates\u201d. Because the intermediates are significantly \ndifferent in appearance to NPCs it is possible that they are not NPC-related structures. \nThe reason we think they are is because they are about the right diameter and have the \ncharacteristic eight fold rotational symmetry of NPCs, and their components are \nconsistent with previously identified NPC substructures. We know of no other similar \nstructure that might be found on the nuclear envelope. \n \nWe observed, in regions of some nuclei, a striking structure (Fig. 3a, circles) which, \nconsisted of eight filaments radiating out from the center to give a wagon wheel like \nstructure. Such structures were also observed in Chironomus tentans salivary gland \nNEs after NPCs were fractured by \u201crolling\u201d the nucleus (Fig 3e). The filaments are \nconsistent with the internal filaments identified in Xenopus and other organisms \n(Goldberg and Allen, 1996: Kiseleva et al., 1998; Goldberg et al., 1997; Kiseleva et \nal., 2001). Again, this may not be an NPC-related structure, but the diameter and the \nfact that there are eight radiating filaments is suggestive of a NPC-related structure \nand not suggestive of any other known different structure.  \n \nInternal filaments were difficult to identify in complete NPCs, although we did find \nevidence of them (Fig. 3b smaller arrows). It may be that they cannot be detected \neasily in complete NPCs because they are obscured by the overlying cytoplasmic ring \nsubunits. The internal filaments are also clear in putative \u201cintermediates\u201d where the \nthin ring appears to be present but the cytoplasmic ring subunits do not (Fig. 3f). It \nshould be noted that internal filaments have not been observed by any method other \nthan feSEM and it could be argued that they may be artifacts of fixation or critical \npoint drying. It is difficult to avoid chemical fixation in feSEM preparation, but we \nhave observed internal filaments, by feSEM, in frozen hydrated specimens, showing \nthat this potential artifact is not caused by critical point drying (unpublished result). \n \nIn Xenopus the internal filaments appear to attach to the \u201ctop\u201d of the transporter, \nwhich is a controversial cylindrical structure found in the central channel of the NPC \n(Akey and Radermacher, 1993; Kiseleva et al., 1993; Goldberg and Allen, 1996; see \nalso Stoffler at al., 2003). In yeast a central mass is also observed (Fig. 1g large \narrows) and could represents the top part of the central cylinder or transporter. In \nsome NPCs the central globule protrudes from the central channel (Fig. 1f and g small \narrows). Such a structure was also reported in Chironomus and was suggested to be a \nperipheral component of the transporter (Kiseleva et al., 1993), but alternatively it \ncould be material, such as mRNP, in transit. \n  \nThe nucleoplasmic face of the NPC \n \nTo reveal the nucleoplasmic face of the yeast NPC, nuclei were fractured by \ncentrifugation at 10,000 X g to disrupt the NE. This revealed NEs where the \nnucleoplasmic face of NPCs were either mostly obscured by intranuclear material \n(Fig. 4a) or NEs where some NPCs were visible and some were damaged (Fig. 4b). \nHowever some NPCs retained a morphology that was similar to that in Xenopus and \nother previously studied organisms. Yeast NPC baskets were however mostly at least \npartially damaged compared to Xenopus. This is mostly likely because manual \nisolation of Xenopus NEs is very mild compared to exposure of the nucleoplasmic \nface of the yeast NE. \n 10 \n  \nAs with all other organisms studied so far, we found filaments attached to the outer \nperiphery of the NPC and extending into the nucleus (Fig. 4c white arrows). \nSometimes these filaments joined together to form the distinctive basket or fish-trap \nstructure (Goldberg and Allen, 1992; 1996; Ris, 1991). Yeast baskets have previously \nbeen suggested  from analysis of TEM thin sections (Stoffler et al., 1999; Fahrenkrog \net al., 1998; Rout and Blobel, 1993), but we can show here that the yeast basket \nappears to be very similar to that of vertebrates and other organisms. There are up to \neight basket filaments, which are about 10nm in diameter and up to 40nm long, which \nis similar to Xenopus when viewed by feSEM (Goldberg and Allen, 1996).  \n \nEvidence for the nucleoplasmic ring could also be observed (Fig. 4c black arrows). \nThe nucleoplasmic ring is less massive than the cytoplasmic ring (Akey and \nRadermacher, 1993; Reichelt et al., 1990) and is not always so clearly observed, even \nin Xenopus oocyte NEs. In S. cereviseae we can detect an electron emission from \nsome topographical structure between the filaments of the basket, where they appose \nthe membrane (black arrows in Fig.4c), which is consistent with the nucleoplasmic \nring. The ring is not always clear and requires careful inspection but can sometimes \nbe seen, even at low magnification (Fig. 4b, small arrows). As the structure is not \nclearly visualized we cannot say whether its morphology is similar to other \norganisms. What we can see, suggests that it may be a simpler smooth ring, rather \nthan having the eight clear subunits observed in Xenopus. The putative nucleoplasmic \nring diameter is 90-100nm which is larger than that previously reported for the \nnuclear membrane pore (Yang et al., 1998). This suggests that, in our view, it is \nunlikely to be part of the spoke ring complex, which lies within the pore. \n \nOccasionally, thick filaments of about 20nm in diameter were attached to the top of \nsome baskets (Fig. 4b large arrows). These could correspond to filamentous structures \nstretching from the nucleoplasmic face of the NE into the nucleoplasm as described \npreviously in budding yeast (Strambio-de-Castillia etal., 1999) and could represent a \nstructure similar to the NE lattice and \u201ccables\u201d observed in Xenopus (Goldberg and \nAllen, 1996;Ris and Malecki, 1993). Alternatively they could be remnants of \nchromatin. \n \nRole of specific nucleoporins in the NPC \n \nHaving shown that yeast NPCs do have cytoplasmic rings and filaments we wanted to \ndetermine what proteins were involved in these structures. Immuno-gold labeling can \nhelp to determine the location of a protein, whereas the structural analysis of NPCs \ncontaining mutant proteins gives clues as to the structural role of a given protein or \nsubcomplex.  \n \nNup159p may be associated with the cytoplasmic ring \n \nAnti-Nup159p labeling was observed at a low level on most nuclei (not shown), and \nwas increased slightly by a 0.3M NaCl wash . The highest level of labeling was found \non NPCs that appeared incomplete which was about 10 fold more gold particles per \nNPC (1-4 particles\/NPC or 30-35 particles\/half nucleus compared to 0-3 \nparticles\/nucleus in the control where the primary antibody was omitted) than in \ncomplete NPCs. We speculate that incomplete NPCs could be assembly intermediates \n 11 \n(Goldberg and Wiese et al., 1997; Kiseleva et al., 2001) or damaged NPCs. Our \ninterpretation of this is that the Nup159p epitope is not accessible in complete NPCs \nbut would be made partially accessible by the salt wash and is most accessible when \ncertain components are missing, such as during assembly or disassembly, or if they \nare damaged during isolation.  \n \nThe position of the labeling was at the periphery of the cytoplasmic face. Labeling \nwas not in the central channel (Fig. 5a and b), so we can eliminate a location at the \ncentral transporter. Such a position is consistent with the location at the cytoplasmic \nring or the cytoplasmic filaments. However the fact that the level of labeling is greater \nwhen more peripheral structures, such as cytoplasmic filaments, are missing suggests \nthat it is not part of the filaments. The labeling is therefore consistent with a location \non the cytoplasmic ring.  \n \nNup116p may be associated with the cytoplasmic filaments  \nAn anti-Nup116p antibody (which is specific on Western blots and \nimmunoprecipitation) did label intact NPCs at the periphery of the cytoplasmic face \n(Fig. 5c-f and see Ho et al., 2000), showing that the epitope is more accessible. In \ngeneral the labeling appears to be particularly peripheral and possibly associated with \nthe cytoplasmic filaments (see particularly Figs 5e and f). However, this only \nrepresents one position of Nup116p, as thin section TEM shows that it is also in the \ncentral domain and on the nucleoplasmic side (Ho et al., 2000), although it is biased \nto the cytoplasmic side (Rout et al., 2000). \n \nFeSEM analysis of a mutant with perturbations in NPC function  \n \nAnalysis of nucleoporin mutants will provide essential information for understanding \nthe mechanism of both the nuclear transport and NPC structure. Here we looked at the \ntemperature sensitive nup57-E17 mutant (Bucci and Wente, 1998). We have focused \non this mutant for several reasons.  First, protein-protein interactions between Nup57p \nand two other essential S. cerevisiae nucleoporins (Nup49p and Nsp1p) have been \ndefined (Grandi et al., 1995b; Shlaich et al., 1997). Second, the nup57-E17 mutant \nstrain has been extensively characterized for perturbations in nuclear transport and \nNPC composition (Bucci and Wente, 1998). Temperature sensitive growth arrest of \nnup57-E17 cells is coincident with specific defects in nuclear import. The NE in \ntemperature arrested nup57-E17 cells also results in a small number of \u201cherniations\u201d \npreviously observed by TEM as membranous seals over the NPC cytoplasmic face \n(Bucci and Wente, 1998). \n  \nWe isolated nuclei from nup57-E17 cells that were grown at:  \n1. 23\u00b0C (Fig. 6a);  \n2. 37\u00b0C for 2 hours (Fig. 6b);  \n3. 37\u00b0C for 5 hours (Fig. 6c).  \nAt 23\u00b0C the NPCs appeared quite normal (Fig. 6a and d) compared to NPCs with wild \ntype nucleoporins (Fig. 1). There may however be some subtle differences. In \nparticular, the NPCs do not appear to be as consistent or symmetric, suggesting they \nmay be more fragile. A temperature shift to 37\u00b0C for 2 hours caused dramatic changes \n(Fig. 6b and e), the most obvious of which were the loss of internal structures \n(transporter and internal filaments) and removal of the cytoplasmic filaments. The \ncytoplasmic ring appeared to be present in most NPC-like structures (Fig. 6b arrows) \n 12 \nbut sometimes was partially fragmented. The ring appeared less massive as it had less \ntopography and emitted less signal, possibly because the cytoplasmic filaments were \nmissing. The channel through the pore appeared to be stabilized at a fairly consistent \nsize, suggesting that components of the spoke ring complex were still intact. \nHowever, after 5 hours at 37\u00b0C (Fig. 6c and f) most of the remaining recognizable \nstructures were gone and the \u201chole\u201d apparently closed up (Fig 6c arrows), leaving \nstructures that resembled the \u201cdimples\u201d previously suggested to be early assembly \nintermediates (Goldberg and Wiese et al., 1997). NPCs of nuclei isolated from wild \ntype S. cerevisiae, that were incubated at 37\u00b0C were identical to those incubated at \n23\u00b0C, showing that the structural alterations were due to the mutation. \n \nThese results show that disruption of Nup57p function initially causes a disruption of \nthe internal structures, as well as parts of the cytoplasmic ring (after 2 hours), but \nultimately the whole cytoplasmic side of the NPC is destabilized (after 5 hours). This \nfinal step could represent an intermediate in the herniation of the NE observed in \nTEM thin sections (Wente and Blobel, 1993). As all NPCs are affected in this way \nthese effects are most likely due to disruption of pre-existing NPCs rather than mis-\nassembly of new ones, where only a proportion would be affected. \n \nDiscussion \n \nYeast has proved an invaluable tool for identifying nucleoporins and obtaining \ninformation about their functional roles. However, until recently little was known \nabout the structure of the yeast NPC and how it related to the well defined structure of \nthe vertebrate NPC. TEM reconstructions provided the first 3D information for the \nyeast NPC (Yang et al., 1998) and it appeared to be significantly smaller and simpler \nthan in vertebrates (Akey and Radermacher, 1993). This provided a puzzle because \nrecent proteomic analysis of both yeast (Rout et al., 2000) and rat (Cronshaw et al., \n2002) NPCs showed that they both contained a similar complexity of constituent \nproteins. One explanation for this is that the 3D reconstructions (Yang et al., 1998) \ncontained data for part of the structure (the spoke ring complex and transporter) but \nnot for the more peripheral components (cytoplasmic ring and filaments and \nnucleoplasmic ring and basket). This could be because they do not occupy a defined \nposition and are therefore not clearly resolved, or that they are disrupted, disordered \nor lost during isolation or distorted upon interaction with carbon grid during freezing. \nOn the other hand, biochemical data (Rout et al., 2000) does suggest that there is not \nan overall loss of nucleoporins upon isolation. It is difficult, however, to be sure that \nthere is no loss of unknown nucleoporins or partial loss of others, which could result \nin the loss of a structural component without loosing all its constituent proteins. Thin \nsection data (Fahrenkrog et al., 1998) showed the attachment of filaments to both \nsides of the yeast NPC, but components such as the cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic \nrings, the transporter and internal filaments are not readily visible in thin sections.  \n \nYeast and Vertebrate NPCs are structurally similar \nHere we have used feSEM to visualize the cytoplasmic face of individual NPCs in \nsitu in intact nuclei from fission and budding yeast. This has allowed us to look at the \nsurface of relatively intact NPCs. We believe, from this data, that the yeast NPC, like \nthat of other organisms so far studied, does have a cytoplasmic ring (consisting of a \nthin ring and subunits) as well as cytoplasmic filaments and internal filaments. By \n 13 \ndisrupting the nucleus and exposing the nucleoplasmic face we also found evidence \nthat the yeast NPC has a basket and possibly a nucleoplasmic ring, but these were \ndifficult to preserve and image. A comparison of yeast and Xenopus oocyte NPCs is \nshown in Fig.7.  \n \nThe data presented here show, by feSEM, that the peripheral components of yeast \nNPCs are morphologically similar to other organisms so far studied. This view is \nsupported by thin section data (Fahrenkrog et al., 1998; Rout and Blobel, 1993). \nHowever 3D reconstructions (Yang et al., 1998) did not detect cytoplasmic or \nnucleoplasmic rings or baskets, but rather a weak density in these regions, which were \nattributed to collapsed peripheral filaments. Here we show evidence, at least viewed \nby feSEM, that there are cytoplasmic rings and filaments, which are very similar to \nthose observed in Xenopus. We favour the view that these structures are lost or \ndisordered when the yeast NPCs are isolated from the nucleus, which is avoided in \nwork presented here. Alternatively, it is possible that the ring, which we observe, is an \nartifactual structure formed by chemical fixation and drying. We do not favour this \nview because the structure is so similar to the Xenopus cytoplasmic ring seen by \nfeSEM. This in turn is the same as the ring clearly shown in unfixed frozen hydrated \nXenopus oocyte NEs (Akey and Radermacher, 1993) and negatively stained NEs \n(Hinshaw et al., 1992) in TEM reconstructions.  \n \nThe nucleoplasmic face of the NPC appears to be more difficult to preserve, \nessentially because we have to use harsher conditions to disrupt the NE and remove \nthe associated nuclear contents in order to expose the nucleoplasmic face of the NPC. \nFor instance it was recently shown that Mlp1p and Mlp2p, which are the yeast Tpr \nhomologues, organise telomeres to the NPC (Galy et al., 2000). Therefore removal of \nthe NE from the chromosomes is likely to disrupt components of the NPC that contain \nthese proteins, such as the basket. Despite this, by looking at NEs that have been \ndifferently disrupted, we have found structures that appear to be baskets. This was no \ngreat surprise as fairly convincing thin section data showing possible baskets has \npreviously been published (Fahrenkrog et al., 1998; Rout and Blobel, 1993). We also \nshow evidence for nucleoplasmic rings. These appear to be thin and faintly contrasted \nin the feSEM. This could be because they, too, are disrupted or extracted in the \nisolation of the NE. Alternatively they could in fact be significantly different to \nXenopus nucleoplasmic rings. In particular they could be much less massive. \n \nFeSEM Immunolocalisation \nHaving established the structural organisation of the yeast NPC, our long-term \nobjective is to determine which nucleoporins were involved in which structural \ncomponents. This is important because although immuno-TEM has been used to \nlocate yeast nucleoporins, the structural components of the NPC cannot be directly \nvisualized in thin sections. The immuno-feSEM presented here also has its \nlimitations, chiefly that the nuclear surface has to be exposed, providing the \nopportunity for loss or rearrangement of epitopes. With further work it should also be \npossible to increase the resolution of the labeling, by direct labeling and the use of \nsmaller probes.  \n \nFirst we looked at Nup159p, which is part of the Nup82p-Nup159p-Nsp1p complex \n(Belgareh et al., 1998) and is thought to be the yeast homologue of vertebrate \nNup214\/CAN. In yeast, Nup159p localises to the cytoplasmic face (Rout et al., 2000), \n 14 \nas does Nup214 in vertebrates (Kraemer et al., 1994). Nup214 is localised quite \ncentrally (Walther and Pickersgill et al., 2002), possibly on the inner rim of the \ncytoplasmic ring. Here we confirm that in budding yeast Nup159p may also be on the \ncytoplasmic ring. Removal of Nup214 from Xenopus nuclear assembly extracts \nresulted in the assembly of NPCs with apparently normal cytoplasmic rings and \nfilaments (Walther and Pickersgill et al., 2002).  Likewise TEM thin sections (Gorsch \net al., 1995) could not detect any structural effect of a Nup159p mutation. The \nmutation did however inhibit mRNA export, but not import, which is also consistent \nwith Nup214 (Walther and Pickersgill et al., 2002). The results presented here, \ntherefore corroborate the view that yeast Nup159p is the functional homologue of \nvertebrate Nup214\/CAN. \n \nTemperative sensitive mutant of Nup57 \nLike Nup159p, Nup57p also forms a complex with Nsp1, which is distinct from the \nNup159p complex above and contains Nup49p. A temperature sensitive mutation in \nNup57p resulted in NPCs that lack internal structures after 2 hours at the non-\npermissive temperature, but retained elements of the cytoplasmic ring. It was \npreviously shown that this mutation perturbed the incorporation of not only the \nNup57-Nsp1-Nup49 complex but also of Nup116p (Bucci and Wente, 1998). The \nlack of Nup116p is consistent with the lack of cytoplasmic filaments in this nup57-\nE17 mutant at the non-permissive temperature. The mutation however permitted the \nincorporation of the Nup159-Nup82-Nsp1 complex, which is consistent with our \nfinding that the cytoplasmic ring is at least partially present after 2 hours at 37 C. \n \nNup62 is the proposed vertebrate orthologue of Nsp1. In two similar studies, immuno-\ndepletion of Nup62 from Xenopus egg nuclear assembly extracts resulted either in an \napparent inhibition of NPC assembly (Dabauvalle et al., 1990) or assembly of non-\nfunctional NPCs that were missing central structures (Finlay et al., 1991). Although \napparently inconsistent with each other, these results are both similar to certain \naspects to our findings. After 2 hours at the non-permissive temperature our mutant \nhad lost its central structures, presumably as the Nup57-Nsp1-Nup49 complex \ndisassociated. Then after 5 hours the cytoplasmic ring and at least parts of the spoke \nring complex dismantled, presumably because, although these structures are unlikely \nto contain the Nsp1 complex, they must rely on it for their continued stability. The \nposition of Nup57p labelling (Fahrenkrog et al., 1998; Rout et al., 2000) is consistent \nwith the internal filaments that link the transporter to the cytoplasmic ring. Likewise \nNup62 is in a similar position (Guan et al., 1995) and certainly in the region of the \ninternal filaments. Therefore it is possible that the internal filaments consist of the \nNup57-Nsp1-Nup82 complex. So when this linkage is broken, in the nup57-E17 \ntemperature sensitive mutant at 37\u00baC (because Nup57p holds together the Nsp1 \ncomplex - Schlaich et al., 1997), the structures that it may link together (the \ntransporter and the cytoplasmic ring) are no longer stably associated. Indeed the \ntransporter and the internal filaments, are the first structures to disappear at 37\u00baC.  We \ntherefore speculate that the Nup57-Nsp1-Nup49 complex could be a component of the \ninternal filaments. The predicted coiled-coil nature of all the components of this \ncomplex would be consistent with them forming a filament. \n \nCytoplasmic filaments \nOne surprising result is that yeast NPCs contain cytoplasmic filaments, which appear \nto be very similar to those of vertebrates, although such filaments have been indicated \n 15 \nin thin sections (Fahrenkrog et al., 1998). Firstly, they are not detected in 3D \nreconstructions (Yang et al., 1998). Secondly, it has been shown that the Ran binding \nnucleoporin, Nup358, is a major constituent of the filaments (Wu et al., 1995; Delphin \net al., 1997; Walther and Pickersgill et al., 2002), possibly even the filament itself, \nand there is apparently no similar protein in yeast. Despite the fact that Nup358 \nappears to be the major component of cytoplasmic filaments in the vertebrate NPC \n(Walther and Pickersgill et al., 2002) in yeast a similar filament structure could be \nconstructed from one or more different proteins. As Nup358 is a multidomain, \nmultifunctional giant protein, it is entirely possible that several smaller proteins could \nexecute the same function.  \n \nIn summary, we have shown that NPC structure, particularly with respect to the \nperipheral components, is very similar in both budding and fission yeast compared to \nvertebrates and invertebrates. We have shown evidence for yeast cytoplasmic and \npossibly nucleoplasmic rings and internal filaments. We have confirmed evidence that \nthe basket exists in yeast and probably has the same structure as in other organisms. \nLikewise we have confirmed that there are cytoplasmic filaments and shown that they \nhave a similar conformation as in other organisms. Nup159p, like its putative \nvertebrate homologue Nup214, appears to be associated with the cytoplasmic ring. \nNup116p appears to be associated with the cytoplasmic filaments, although it also \noccupies other positions. We have also shown that without Nup57p, which is required \nto stabilise the Nup57-Nsp1-Nup49 complex, the internal filaments and the \ntransporter are absent. With the tools available to yeast cell biologists, such as \nantibodies, tagged nucleoporins, temperature sensitive, deletion, and other \nnucleoporin mutants, the approach shown here could be a useful way to determine the \nroles of nucleoporins in the structural organisation and function of the NPC. \n \n \nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n \nStrain growth, media and reagents \n Saccharomyces cerevisiae wild type strains AB1380 (Mata ade2-1 ura3-1 trp1 \nlys2 his5 can1-100) and J 1003-10 (Mata ade2-1 ura3-1 trp1-1 leu2-3,112 can1-100) \nand Schizosaccharomyces pombe wild type strain HM123 h\n- \nleu1-32 (lab stock)   were \nanalyzed.  In addition, the yeast strain SWY1587 (Mata ura3-1 his3-11,15 trp1-1 \nleu2-3,112 can1-100 ade2-1:ADE2 nup57-E17 ) was analyzed at the permissive \n(23\u00b0C) and restrictive (37\u00b0C) growth temperatures as described (Bucci and Wente, \n1998). The cells were grown in liquid YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% \nbactopeptone, 2% glucose). A stationary yeast culture was diluted at 1:2000 in YPD \nmedium and grown for ~10 hours at 30\u00b0 C with moderate shaking (130 rpm) to \nlogarithmic phase and cells were used when about 80% of cells were dividing. \nReagents were obtained as follows: Zymolase 20T (Sigma), dithiothreitol (Sigma), \nNovozyme (Sigma); Sucrose ultrapure (Agar), sorbitol (Serva), Poly-L-lysine and \nHoechst 33258 (Sigma). \n  \nIsolation of nuclei  \nTwo methods of nuclear isolation were used: from spheroplasts (method A) and from  \nwhole frozen cells (method B). The spheroplast methods for budding and fission yeast \nwere modified from previously described studies (Rozijn and Tonino, 1964; Hurt, \n1988).  About 3 g weight of wet yeast cells were harvested by centrifugation in a \n 16 \nSorvall GS3-rotor, washed once in 100 ml water and incubated in 30 ml 0.1M Tris-\nHCl, pH 9.4, 10 mM dithiothreitol for 25 min at 30\u00b0C with moderate shaking.  Cells \nwere pelleted, washed in 50 ml spheroplast buffer (1.2M sorbitol, 20 mM potassium \nphosphate, pH 7.4) and resuspended in 25 ml spheroplast buffer containing 1 mg \nzymolase 20T per gram of wet cells for budding yeast and 10mg\/ml Novozym for \nfision yeast, then incubated for 20- 40 min at 30\u00b0C with gentle shaking.  When about \n70% of the cells were converted to spheroplasts, they were pelleted for 3 min at 3500 \nrpm in a Sorvall SS34 rotor and washed twice in spheroplast buffer.  The final pellet \nwas resuspended at room temperature in 10 ml spheroplast buffer with 0.5 mM MgCl2 \npH 6.5.  All subsequent steps were at 4\u00b0C. 200 l of spheroplast homogenate were \ntransferred into a glass tube and diluted with 200 l distilled water.  This was \nincubated for 2 min to allow the spheroplasts to swell and was then vortexed for 2 \nseconds. The specimens were then checked using light and fluorescence microscopy \nby staining with 5 g\/ml Hoechst 33258. Before or after additional incubation of the \nsamples for 10 min with 0.3 M NaCl in 20 mM potassium phosphate pH 6.5 to \nremove ribosomes from the NE surface, they were immediately prepared for the \nfeSEM (below).  \n \nNuclear isolation from whole cells involved manual grinding of frozen yeast cells, \nand was modified from a previously described method (den Hollander et al., 1986).  \nYeast cells were suspended in 1.2 M sorbitol, 2 M sucrose, 20 mM potassium \nphosphate, 0.5 mM MgCl2 pH 6.5 and frozen as small drops in liquid nitrogen.  \nFrozen drops covered by liquid nitrogen were ground into powder with a pestle and \nfixed immediately (see fixative solution below) after thawing to 4\u00b0 C. \n \nPreparation of samples for feSEM \nFor feSEM, 5mm x 5mm silicon chips were treated with 1 mg\/ml poly-L-lysine in \ndistilled water for 30 min, then rinsed in water and transferred to buffer containing 20 \nmM potassium phosphate, 0.5 mM MgCl2, pH 6.5. 10 l of the samples prepared by \nmethod A or by method B were layered on top of 40 l fixative (20 mM potassium \nphosphate, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2M sucrose, 4% paraformaldehyde, pH 6.5) and spun \nonto a silicon chip (Agar) at 4000 X g for 3 minutes in a swing-out rotor.  During this \ncentrifugation, spheroplast membranes in samples from methods A were broken due \nto impact with the chip surface, and their contents were released and fixed \nimmediately on the chips.  To visualize the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC, the \nspheroplast samples were pelleted for 3 min at 10,000 X g to disrupt the NE.  After \ncentrifugation, the chips were further fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde, 0.2% tannic acid, \n20 mM potassium phosphate, 0.5 mM MgCl2, pH 7 for 10 minutes at room \ntemperature, postfixed with 1% (w\/v) osmium tetroxide for 10 minutes, then stained \nwith 1% (w\/v) uranyl acetate for 10 minutes (both solutions in distilled water), \ndehydrated in ethanol and critical-point dried from CO2 via Arklone (ICI, Runcorn, \nCheshire, UK).  Specimens were sputter coated with 2-4 nm of tantalum in an \nEdwards 306 cryo-pumped vacuum system with a magnetron head (Edwards High \nVacuum International, Crawley, West Sussex, UK).  Samples were examined at 30kV \nin the top stage of a Topcon (ABT) ISI DS-130F field emission scanning electron \nmicroscope (Topcon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).  Measurements of individual NPC \ncomponents were done on micrographs of 20 different samples prepared by \nspheroplast or freeze\/grind methods.  \n \n 17 \nPreparation of samples for immuno-feSEM \nYeast nuclei before or after removal of the ribosomes were isolated from spheroplasts \nby method A and centrifuged onto silicon chips for 3 min at 4000 g through buffer A \n(20mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.5mM  MgCl2 , 0.2 M Sucrose). Samples were then  \ntransferred to buffer A without sucrose containing 3.7% formaldehyde and fixed for \n15 min, and then given two washes in buffer A without sucrose for 5 min. Samples \nwere blocked for 20 min in 1% BSA, 20 mM Tris-HCl, then incubated (with shaking) \nfor 60 min with either the rabbit anti-Nup116-C antibody (1:10 dilution) (raised \nagainst the C-terminal 60kD domain and specific for Nup116p by Western blots and \nimmunoprecipitation and affinity purified against the cognate epitope) or mouse Mab \nagainst Nup159p (Mab 165C10; 1:50 - Kraemer et al ., 1995), or with buffer as a \ncontrol, and washed twice for 5 min with 0.001% (wt\/vol) Tween 20, 20 mM Tris-\nHCl. The samples were incubated for 30 min with secondary gold-conjugated goat \nanti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody (AuroProb TM EM GAR IgG G10; 10 nm in \ndiameter; Amersham) in 0.2% BSA-20 mM Tris-HCl (1:20). The samples were \nwashed twice with 20mM Tris-HCl  and fixed for 10 min in 2% (wt\/vol) \nglutaraldehyde, 0.2% (wt\/vol) tannic acid in 20 mM Tris-HCl, rinsed with buffer, and \nincubated for 10 min in 1% OsO4 in water. Further processing and feSEM analysis \nwere performed as described above, except that after critical point drying, the samples \nwere coated with 4 nm of chromium. The backscattered electron imaging mode was \nused to resolve the gold particles by feSEM, using a solid-state retractable backscatter \nelectron detector in the top stage of the TOPCON (ISI) DS 130F SEM. To determine \nthe position of the gold particles, backscatter electron images were precisely \noverlayed onto the secondary image in Adobe Photoshop, the position of the colloidal \ngold signal marked with a black dot, then the backscatter image layer (which obscures \nsome of the secondary electron detail) removed. \n \nPreparation of Chironomus nuclei  \nIsolated salivary gland cells were kept in cold TKM buffer (100mM KCl, 1mM \nMgCl2, and 10mM trietahanolamine-HCl, pH 7.0), supplemented with 2% NP-40 for \n10-30 seconds and then transferred into 0.025% NP-40. The nuclei were isolated from \nglands by pipetting. To remove the cytoplasmic rings from the NPC, the nuclei were \nallowed to adhere to the silicon chip and then gently rolled over the surface by \npushing with a glass needle as described previously (Kiseleva et al., 1998). The \nsamples were fixed and processed as described for the yeast nuclei. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe thank Dr. M.

The position of \nthe label appears peripheral and NPCs are most often labelled when they appear \nincomplete (b). Nup116p labelling however could be more peripheral and labels \ncomplete NPCs more frequently (c-f). Bars = 100nm \n \nFigure 6. The nup57-E17 temperature sensitive mutant maintained at 23\u00baC (a and d), \n37\u00baC for 2 hours (b and e) and 37\u00baC for 5 hours (c and f). At 23\u00baC, the NPCs appeared \nquite normal. After 2 hours of cell growth at non-permissive temperature the NPCs \nlost central structures (transporter and internal filaments). Only small holes or dimples \nof about 20nm in diameter instead of NPCs were observed in the nuclear envelope \nafter 5 hours of cell growth at 37\u00baC.  Bar = 100nm \n \n 25 \nFigure 7. Model (adapted from Yang et al., 1998) and images of the cytoplasmic face \nof the NPC comparing yeast and Xenopus. CF = cytoplasmic filaments; CRS = \ncytoplasmic ring subunits; TR = thin ring; ONM = outer nuclear membrane; IF = \ninternal filaments; MR = membrane ring; T = transporter; ISD = inner spoke domain; \nINM = inner nuclear membrane; NR = nucleoplasmic ring; B = basket. Coloured \ncomponents are those observed by feSEM, although the basket had previously been \nindicated and the nucleoplasmic internal filaments remain a speculation.
