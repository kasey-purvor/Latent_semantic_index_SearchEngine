Introduction\nThe extended X-ray absorption \u00aene structure, or EXAFS, is the \u00aene\nstructure observed in the X-ray absorption coef\u00aecient as a function of\nenergy. This \u00aene structure, beginning immediately above the edge\nand extending up to 1000 V or more beyond an absorption edge,\ncontains information on atomic arrangements, bond lengths and\ncoordination numbers.\nInterpretation of the EXAFS may be based on a simple equation\n(Lee & Pendry, 1975) obtained using the plane wave approximation.\nThe single-electron single-scattering expression for the EXAFS\nfunction, \u001f\u0085k\u0086, is,\n\u001fi\u0085k\u0086 \u0088\nX\nj\ns2oe\n\u00ff2rj=\u0015 Njj fj\u0085k; \u0019\u0086j\nkr2j\nsin\u00892krj \u0087 2\u000ej\u0085k; r\u0086 \u0087  j\u008a: \u00851\u0086\nEquation (1) describes the EXAFS due to scattering by shells of Nj\natoms at a distance rj from the absorbing atom. fj\u0085k\u0086 is the back-\nscattering amplitude from each of the Nj neighbours whilst the\nreduction factors e\u00ff2rj=\u0015 and s2o account for discrepancies between the\npredicted and experimentally measured amplitudes.\nThese discrepancies arise because only elastically scattered\nphotoelectrons contribute to the primary channel EXAFS. With a\nreal scattering potential, the reduction factors are needed to account\nfor effective absorptions from the photoelectron beam due to various\ninelastic scattering processes. The mean-free-path term, e\u00ff2rj=\u0015,\naccounts for losses from inelastic scattering events at neighbouring\natoms and in the medium in-between, whilst the constant amplitude\nreduction factor, s2o, otherwise known as AFAC, approximates the\nintrinsic losses, those due to multiple electron excitations at the\nabsorbing atom. Traditionally, the factor VPI in the mean-free-path\nterm, \u0015 \u0088 k=VPI , is approximated by the canonical value of 4 eV\ngiven by LEED calculations whilst the constant amplitude reduction\nfactor is taken to be \u0018 0:7.\nMost modern EXAFS data-analysis programs use a complex\nexchange and correlation potential to model inelastic effects, for\nexample the Hedin\u00b1Lundqvist (HL) potential (Hedin & Lundqvist,\n1969) used in the standard Daresbury package EXCURV98 (Binsted,\n1998) and in the equivalent American program, FEFF (Zabinsky et\nal., 1995). This potential gives rise to complex phase shifts in equation\n(1) and in the more accurate curved-wave (Gurman et al., 1984) forms\nof the theory typically used in data analysis, and therefore includes\nsome, if not all, of the reduction effects.\nThe HL potential is only designed to model the so-called extrinsic\nlosses, those usually approximated by the mean-free-path term. In\nthis case, EXAFS data analysis should be performed with a default\nvalue of AFAC of approximately 0.7 (see, for example EXCURV92).\nHowever, some years experience by EXAFS users at Daresbury\ndemonstrated this value of AFAC to be too low. It was believed that\nthe HL potential was overestimating the extrinsic losses and there-\nfore, accidentally, including some of the weight of the intrinsic losses\nfrom multiple excitations at the absorbing atom. This led to the\ndefault value of AFAC being set to unity in the current issue of\nEXCURV (EXCURV98). The accuracy of the HL potential has been\nthe subject of much discussion in the XAS community over recent\nyears (Fujikawa et al., 2000; Newville et al., 1993; Tyson et al., 1992),\nalthough as yet we are not aware of any viable alternatives to its use\nfor routine data analysis.\nIn this paper we present a systematic examination of the EXAFS\namplitudes produced by the imaginary part of the HL potential. We\ndemonstrate that this potential does indeed overestimate the\nextrinsic losses, and that the HL potential gives good agreement with\nthe total losses from the elastically scattered photoelectron wave in\nthe EXAFS range of photoelectron energies. This agreement is,\nhowever, somewhat fortuitous and we therefore conclude that, whilst\nthe HL potential is good enough at present, some thought should be\ngiven to improving the modelling of inelastic processes in future\nissues of EXCURV and other data-analysis programs.\nThe paper is broadly split into two sections. In the \u00aerst, we brie\u00afy\ndetail the method used to calculate the EXAFS amplitude in the\npresence of the HL potential. In the second, we calculate the losses\ngenerated by the HL potential using this theory and compare them\nwith the historically used EXAFS loss factors: a constant amplitude\nreduction factor, s2o, and a mean free path term, e\n\u00ff2rj=\u0015.\nThis paper expands upon and clari\u00aees a short note in the confer-\nence proceedings of XAFS X (Roy & Gurman, 1999). In the \u00aenal\nresults obtained here we have used SI units of electron volts and\nAngstro\u00c8 ms. In the theory section, however, we use Hartree units for\nsimplicity.\n2. Theory\n2.1. The EXAFS amplitudes\nIn principle we could use a program such as EXCURV98 to\ninvestigate the effects of the HL potential on the EXAFS amplitudes.\nThe full EXAFS could be calculated both using the HL potential and\nusing a real scattering potential such as the X\u000b potential, and the\namplitudes compared. However, the two potentials give \u00aene structure\nof a different phase which makes a direct comparison problematical.\nInstead we choose to calculate the effect of the imaginary part of the\nHL potential on the EXAFS in the \u00aerst Born approximation. This\ngives the amplitude diminution directly.\nStandard single electron EXAFS theory may be developed within\nthe muf\u00aen tin approximation using the Hartree photoelectron Green\nfunction, Go\u0085r; r0\u0086,\nJ.

In this paper we use the Hartree Green function to examine\nthe photoelectron \u00afux.

Then, using standard results from the many derivations of\nthe EXAFS function available, we \u00aend the photoelectron \u00afux to be\ngiven by,\nS \u0088 kE\n2\no\n6\nX\nl\nA\u0085l; lo\u0086jhRljrj\u001elo ij2\n\u00ff\n1 \u0087 \u001f\u0085k\u0086\u0001: \u00858\u0086\nA\u0085l; lo\u0086 is the angle factor of Gurman (1983), whilst \u001f\u0085k\u0086 is the\nEXAFS function of equation (1), or a more accurate equivalent.

This is the standard result for the X-ray absorption coef\u00aecient\nin the absence of inelastic scattering. Finally, the backscattering factor\nfj\u0085k; \u0019\u0086 from equation (1) is found to be\nfj\u0085k; \u0019\u0086 \u0088 \u00ff\n2\u0019\n{k\nX\nL\n\u0085\u00ff1\u0086L\u00852L\u0087 1\u0086\u00851 \u00ff e2{\u000eL \u0086 \u0088 j fj\u0085k; \u0019\u0086 je{ : \u008510\u0086\nIn this paper we are interested in the EXAFS function in the presence\nof an arbitrary energy-dependent imaginary part of the potential. We\ntreat this imaginary part as a small perturbation on the system. Then,\nto \u00aerst order in the imaginary part of the potential, VI , the Hartree\nGreen function becomes,\nG1\u0085r; r0\u0086 \u0088 Go\u0085r; r0\u0086 \u00ff {Go\u0085r; r1\u0086VI\u0085r1\u0086Go\u0085r1; r0\u0086; \u008511\u0086\nwhere the Green function, Go\u0085r; r0\u0086, has r0< rmt and r > rmt whilst\nGo\u0085r1; r0\u0086 has both r1 and r0 inside the muf\u00aen tin. We assume that\nr1 > r\n0 as the initial state, \u001elo , will always be highly localized whilst\nthe imaginary part of the potential, VI , is zero toward the centre of\nthe atom (this shall be demonstrated in section 3). This means that\nthe double integral in equation (6) will only be signi\u00aecant in the\nregions where r1 > r\n0. Also, within the muf\u00aen tin approximation, VI is\nspherically symmetric so that the angular integrals over the directions\nof r1 simply reduce to the orthogonality integrals for the spherical\nharmonics.\nThe perturbed Green function always has the same functional form\nas Go whether or not r and r\n0 are inside or outside the muf\u00aen tin. For r\nand r0 outside the muf\u00aen tin the Green function will simply be\nmultiplied by a numerical factor \u00851 \u00ff 12 khRljVI jRli\u0086 whilst with either\nr or r0 or both inside the muf\u00aen tin the perturbed Green function can\nbe written as Go\u00851 \u00ff 12 khRljVI jRl \u00ff {Xli\u0086.

However,\ncompared with the phase shifts, the radial matrix element hRLjVI jXLi\nis always small. This is because the imaginary part of the HL\npotential, VI , is approximately constant over much of the region of\nthe atom. Thus, as RL and XL are orthogonal, the matrix element\nhRLjVI jXLi must be small. From Fig. 1 we can see that for most of the\nenergy range investigated hRljVI jXli is much less than 1% of the\nphase shifts. The neglect of this term in the calculation of the EXAFS\namplitude is therefore valid.\nThus, in the presence of an imaginary part to the potential the\nEXAFS amplitude is given to \u00aerst order in VI by\nAl \u0088 1 \u00ff 2khRljVI jRli\nf 0j \u0085\u0019\u0086\nfj\u0085\u0019\u0086\n\f\f\f\f\f\n\f\f\f\f\f: \u008518\u0086\nIn the above equation we can identify two parts to the amplitude\nreduction: 2khRljVI jRli comes from the central atom muf\u00aen tin;\nkhRljVI jRli is the \u00afux lost from the elastically scattered photoelec-\ntron wave originating from an isolated atom. In EXAFS, of course,\nthe photoelectron wave encounters the central atom potential twice,\nonce on the way out and once on the way back in. The j f 0j \u0085\u0019\u0086=fj\u0085\u0019\u0086j\nterm is the reduction to the EXAFS amplitudes caused by inelastic\nexcitations at the scattering atoms.\n2.2. The HL potential\nThe HL potential was originally developed to model exchange and\ncorrelation effects in a uniform electron gas (Hedin & Lundqvist,\n1969). This model goes beyond the Hartree Fock theory by using a\nsingle plasmon pole (SPP) form of the dielectric function to calculate\nthe electron self energy. The SPP dielectric function approximates all\nthe inelastic electron\u00b1electron interactions as plasmons. The weight\nof the plasmon absorptions is adjusted so as to approximate the total\nof the actual plasmon excitations plus particle\u00b1hole excitations. Tyson\net al. (1992) argue that this adjustment of the weight of the plasmon\nexcitations should lead to good results for the total (plasmon plus\nsingle particle) extrinsic inelastic excitations. It does not include the\nintrinsic effects due to the appearance of the core hole. This may\neasily be seen since the HL losses go to zero at very high photo-\nelectron energies whereas the core hole effects tend to a constant loss\nin this limit [see discussion of equation (22) below].\nThe HL potential was \u00aerst applied to EXAFS calculations within\nthe local density approximation by Lee & Beni (1976). Its calculation\nis a standard problem. Here we simply quote the result for the\nimaginary part of the potential,\nVI\u0085r;Ei\u0086 \u0088 \u00ff\n!2p\n2k\nZ qmax\no\ndq\nq!q\nZ x1\n\u00ff1\n\u000e x\u00ff\n1\n2 q\n2 \u0087 !q\nkq\n\u0012 \u0013\ndx; \u008519\u0086\nwhere Ei \u0088 !\u00ff j!oj is the photoelectron energy, !p is the plasma\nfrequency of an electron gas of density n, !2p \u0088 4\u0019n. In the local\ndensity approximation both the electron density and hence !p\ndepend on r. The q-dependent plasmon excitation frequency is\n!2q \u0088 !2p \u0087 13 q2k2f \u0087 14 q4, and qmax \u0088 k\u0087 kf where 12 k2f = Vo\u0085r\u0086 \u0087 Ef is\nthe kinetic energy at the Fermi level. Vo\u0085r\u0086 is the atomic potential and\nEf is the thermodynamic Fermi energy. The imaginary part of the\nexchange and correlation potential is only non-zero for electrons with\nenergies greater than that needed to excite a local plasmon,\nEi \u00ff Ef > !q. Below this energy the incident electrons are not\nenergetic enough to excite a plasmon and so, in the single plasmon\npole approximation, inelastic scattering events are impossible.\n3. Results\nIn this section we use equation (18) to examine the effects of the HL\npotential on the EXAFS amplitudes for a number of different\nelements. Primarily we look at silicon, copper and silver as experi-\nmental data is available for these three elements, which cover a wide\nrange of atomic number and K-edge energies. Fig. 2 shows the\nimaginary part of the HL potential calculated for silicon, copper and\nsilver.\nFor all elements, the imaginary part of the HL potential is zero at\nsmall r. In this region of high electronic density the incident photo-\nelectron is insuf\u00aeciently energetic to excite a plasmon. As soon as the\ndensity falls suf\u00aeciently for plasmons to be excited, VI cuts in almost\nimmediately to its maximum value. At larger incident photoelectron\nenergies, VI obviously cuts in at lower radii; however, for large Ei the\nimaginary part of the potential is generally smaller in the outer\nregions of the atomic muf\u00aen tins. The energy dependence of the\nimaginary part of the HL potential is shown for bromine in Fig. 1 of\nLee & Beni (1976).\nJ. Synchrotron Rad.

The electron\nmean free paths for these elements will therefore also be very similar\nas has long been found experimentally.\nThe radius at which the HL potential cuts in moves slightly\noutward as we go up in atomic number. This is because the electron\ndensity is larger close to the nucleus for elements with higher atomic\nnumbers. The corresponding plasmon excitation frequency is there-\nfore higher and so we have to move further from the centre of the\natom before it becomes possible to excite a plasmon with a photo-\nelectron of given energy.\nIt is instructive to examine the average imaginary part of the HL\npotential. This can be calculated simply from,\nVAVG\u0085k\u0086 \u0088\n3\nr3mt\nZ rmt\no\nVI\u0085r; k\u0086r2dr: \u008520\u0086\nIn Fig. 3 we plot the average imaginary part of the potential against k\nfor copper. The imaginary part of the potential has an average value\nof approximately 4.8 eV over most of the range of energy appropriate\nto EXAFS data analysis. This is close to, but slightly higher than, the\ncanonical value of 4 eV generally used to account for the extrinsic\nlosses in LEED calculations for example (Pendry, 1974). The average\nimaginary part of the HL potential is also very similar for all atoms.\nThis is a consequence of describing the atoms as shells of varying\nelectron density.\nFig. 3 also shows that the average potential falls off with increasing\nphoton energy above the edge. This can also be deduced from\nequation (19).

We\ncan see that equation (22) for VI will obviously go to zero as k\nbecomes very large. As VI is designed to model only the extrinsic\nphotoelectron scatterings this is correct.\nIn Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) we compare the measured k3 weighted\nEXAFS for crystalline silicon to best-\u00aet theoretical curves calculated\nwith (a) the X\u000b potential including an amplitude reduction factor of\nFigure 2\nThe imaginary part of the HL potential in eV, at k = 15A\u00ca \u00ff1.

In reality s2o will obviously have some energy dependence\n(Roy et al., 2001), but in this traditional method of data analysis s2o is\nalways approximated by its constant high-energy limit.\nThe silicon spectrum [published by Gurman & McGreevy (1990)]\nwas measured on beamline 3.4 of the CLRC Daresbury laboratory.\nPre- and post-edge background was subtracted using polynomial \u00aets\n(EXBACK) and the background-subtracted spectra \u00aetted using\nEXCURV98 using three shells with \u00aexed coordination number. The\ninteratomic distances and Debye\u00b1Waller factors obtained are shown\nin Table 1. The \u00aet using the X\u000b potential gives a \u00aet index of 39.2. The\nHL potential gives a slightly better match to experiment, with a \u00aet\nindex of 37.6. In both \u00aets the default EXCURV value for the core-\nhole lifetime of 0.43 eV was used, whilst the experimental resolution\nof \u00180.1 eV was considered small enough to be neglected.\nThe experiment and theory diverge at low energies where multiple\nscattering becomes more important, but between approximately 3\nand 14 A\u00ca \u00ff1 both theoretical approaches give reasonable \u00aets to\nexperiment. It is noticeable that at low k the X\u000b potential result is\nkilled by the correction factors whilst the HL potential gives much\nlarger magnitudes and a much more satisfactory match to experi-\nment. In this region the ad hoc correction factors applied to the\nEXAFS amplitudes in the X\u000b calculation greatly overestimate the\ninelastic losses. This accounts for the better \u00aet index obtained using\nthe HL potential.\nFig. 4(c) compares the two theoretical calculations described above\nto a third calculation performed using the HL potential without any\namplitude corrections applied. This succinctly shows the problem\nwith all real potential calculations of the EXAFS: namely amplitudes\nwhich are much too large.\nFinally, in Fig. 4(d), we demonstrate the accuracy of the approx-\nimate result from equation (18) in estimating the EXAFS amplitudes\nin the presence of an imaginary potential [equation (18)]. The solid\nline shows the calculated amplitude from equation (18) whilst the\ncircles are obtained by dividing the amplitudes given by the HL\npotential with those found using the X\u000b potential with no corrections.\nThese two calculations give results for the \u00aene structure which are\nslightly out of phase, therefore, to obtain a rough estimate of the\neffect of the imaginary part of the HL potential on the amplitude of\nan exact calculation we have compared the results of the two calcu-\nlations at corresponding peaks. The circles are the ratios of these\namplitudes at successive peaks, whilst the crosses show the corre-\nsponding ratio of peak heights between the lossless X\u000b calculation\nand the X\u000b calculation with added correction factors. The differing\nreal parts of the HL and X\u000b potentials give slightly different scat-\ntering strengths for each of the shells which further complicates the\nsituation, but we have ignored this effect in these plots. From the\nplots it is apparent that all three sets of amplitudes are roughly\nconsistent in the region primarily of interest to EXAFS data analysis,\nwhilst the amplitudes given by the ad hoc correction factors to the X\u000b\npotential appear to be tending to zero at low energies.\nFigs. 5, 6 and 7 show the major results of this paper.

The photoelectron wave-\nvector is not zero at the X-ray absorption edge because of the \u00aenite\nFermi energy.\nThe EXAFS amplitude is calculated using equation (18) for three\nvery different elements: silicon, copper and silver. This is then\ncompared with known values of the empirical parameters, s2o\u0085k\u0086 and\ne\u00ff2rj=\u0015\u0085k\u0086, \u00aetted using the real X\u000b potential for the three elements with\nthe data analysis program EXCURV98, in the same way as described\npreviously for silicon. The best-\u00aet values of s2o and the effective\nconstant imaginary potential, VPI , were found to be (Gurman, 1999)\ns2o = 0:70 \u0006 0:1 for copper and s2o = 0:67 \u0006 0:15 for silver. The VPI\nvalues used were: \u00ff4.0 eV \u0006 0.2 eV for copper and \u00ff6.3 eV \u0006 0.2 eV\nfor silver where the quoted uncertainties are 2\u001b errors. In the \u00aegures\nthe solid band shows the product of the \u00aetted vales of s2o and e\n\u00ff2rj=\u0015\u0085k\u0086\nwithin the limit of experimental error whilst the black line gives the\ncalculated EXAFS amplitude [equation (18)]. Below a k of about\n3 A\u00ca \u00ff1 the historically used EXAFS reduction parameters exhibit\nunphysical behaviour. Using a constant imaginary part to the\npotential we obtain a zero mean free path at low k and hence an\nEXAFS amplitude of zero. This is obviously incorrect as, below, the\nminimum electron excitation energy in the system there cannot be\nany inelastic scatterings and hence the EXAFS amplitudes should be\nunity. This was a known problem in older data analysis.\nAt low X-ray energies above the edge the calculated amplitude\nusing the HL potential is unity. This is correct. At low energies the\nphotoelectron is insuf\u00aeciently energetic to excite a plasmon anywhere\nin the atomic muf\u00aen tin. The energy at which the amplitude begins to\ndeviate from unity corresponds to the plasmon frequency in the\nregion of low electronic density toward the edge of the muf\u00aen tin. In\nan atomic calculation this cut-in energy would be that of the most\nweakly bound atomic orbital. The rapid cut-in of the amplitude\nreduction is a feature of the HL potential. This occurs because the\nmajority of the imaginary part of the HL potential comes from the\nregion of almost constant electronic density toward the edge of the\nmuf\u00aen tin spheres.\nAt high k the HL potential overestimates the EXAFS amplitudes.\nThe HL potential models the extrinsic loss effects and so, like the\nmean-free-path term, it will disappear at high energies. From Figs. 5, 6\nand 7 it is clear that the calculated amplitudes are still increasing at\nk = 15 A\u00ca \u00ff1. The HL potential itself varies as 1=k at large k, and, as\nthe radial wavefunctions, Rl\u0085kr\u0086, are also proportional to 1=k at high\nenergies, the EXAFS amplitudes given by the HL potential will\nobviously tend to unity. However, using the sudden approximation\nwe can show that the intrinsic loss parameter, and hence the total\namplitude reduction, should tend to a constant value of about 0.7 at\nhigh photoelectron energies (Rehr et al., 1978; Roy & Gurman, 1997).\nThe difference arises because the HL potential does not include a\ncontribution from the core hole.\nThe losses obtained from the HL potential agree reasonably well\nwith the total reduction given by the semi-empirical reduction\nparameters. The HL potential must therefore overestimate the losses\nproduced by the mean-free-path effects alone. Over the range of a\ntypical EXAFS spectrum, 3 to 14 A\u00ca \u00ff1, the calculated reduction\nparameters lie within the error range of the best-\u00aet experimental\ndata. The correlation between the calculations and the \u00aetted\nempirical parameters can be measured in this region using the\nR-factor,\nR \u0088\nP jAexpt \u00ff AtheoryjP jAexptj \u0002 100%: \u008523\u0086\nWe \u00aend R = 4:9% for silicon, R = 6:5% for copper and R = 10:4% for\nsilver. These uncertainties are much lower than those observed in the\nbest \u00aet parameters for the various elements: 15:5% for silicon, 16:1%\nfor copper and 24:4% for silver, which suggests that the reduction\ngiven by the HL potential is equivalent to that produced by the semi-\nempirical reduction parameters.\nEXCURV98 was also used to \u00aet values for the adjustable para-\nmeter, s2o, using the HL potential. We found values of s\n2\no\u0085k\u0086 =\n0:92 \u0006 0:10 for silicon, s2o\u0085k\u0086 = 1:05 \u0006 0:05 for copper and s2o\u0085k\u0086 =\n1:02 \u0006 0:05 for silver. These values are all consistent with unity which\nsuggests that additional amplitude \u00aetting parameters should not be\nused when data \u00aetting using the HL potential. It would appear that\nthe HL potential gives extremely good results for EXAFS calcula-\ntions, albeit accidentally.\nFitting the amplitude reduction parameter for a number of\nelements we obtain the points shown in Fig. 8. These points exhibit\nsome scatter but are generally much larger than the values of s2o which\nwe would expect to obtain using the X\u000b potential and a mean-free-\npath term. We therefore conclude that the HL potential signi\u00aecantly\noverestimates the extrinsic losses to the EXAFS amplitude. Empiri-\ncally, the HL potential includes most, if not all, of the contribution\nfrom the intrinsic loss events.\nWe believe this conclusion may be tentatively generalized to\nmolecular and ionic compounds. Fig. 8 demonstrates that the HL\npotential gives good results for a number of different atomic systems,\nwhilst the general experience of EXAFS users is that this potential\ngives reasonable amplitudes for a range of different compounds:\nhence the success of the major programs FEFF and EXCURV which\nuse the HL potential. Tyson et al. (1992) \u00aend good EXAFS ampli-\ntudes using the HL potential with no corrections for intrinsic effects\nfor the molecular systems SF6, GeCl4 and Br2, whilst Amiss &\nGurman (1999) come to the same conclusion for a biological system.\nTo study in detail the effect of anisotropic charge densities we would\nhave to move beyond the muf\u00aen tin approximation. Schemes for full\npotential calculations have been proposed (see, for example, Natoli et\nal., 1986) but the calculations by Tyson et al. (1992) suggest that the\ndifferences between a full potential treatment and the muf\u00aen tin\napproximation are small.\nTo summarize, the HL potential was designed to model the\nextrinsic loss effects. However, using equation (18) or the Daresbury\nprogram EXCURV98 we \u00aend that the imaginary part of the HL\nFigure 8\nThe amplitude reduction factor obtained by \u00aetting EXAFS spectra using the\nHL potential with the Daresbury program EXCURV98. Plotted as a function\nof atomic number.\nelectronic reprint\npotential signi\u00aecantly overestimates the losses produced by the\nextrinsic effects alone. Instead it seems to, qualitatively, reproduce\nthe total losses to the EXAFS amplitude even though the average\nimaginary part is consistent with the constant potential of \u00ff4 eV\nobtained from LEED experiments. The reason for this is the shape of\nthe imaginary part of the HL potential. The average value would\ncorrectly account for the extrinsic losses; however, the HL potential\nemphasizes the middle and outer regions of the muf\u00aen tin as opposed\nto the region near to the nucleus where r2Rl\u0085r\u0086 is small anyway and\ntherefore overestimates the losses. This can be immediately seen from\na calculation of the energy-dependent mean free path obtained from\nthe HL potential.\nIn Fig. 9 we plot the mean free paths for aluminium obtained from\nthree different calculations and compare to data reproduced from\nPenn (1987). In an isolated atom the loss of photoelectron \u00afux is\nrelated to the mean free path by exp\u0089\u00ffrmt=\u0015\u0085k\u0086\u008a where \u0015 is the\nrelevant mean free path for \u00afux. Equating this expression to the \u00afux\nloss caused by the imaginary part of the HL potential we can\nimmediately obtain an expression for the mean free path given by the\nHL potential,\n\u0015HL\u0085k\u0086 \u0088\n\u00ffrmt\nlog\u00851 \u0087 khRljVI jRli\u0086\n: \u008524\u0086\nIn terms of a constant imaginary potential the \u00afux mean free path can\nbe written \u0015\u0085k\u0086 = k=2VPI .\nIn Fig. 9 we can see that the HL potential gives a mean free path\nthat is much shorter than that found experimentally. The average part\nof the HL potential, however, reproduces the experimental results to\nmuch better accuracy and gives magnitudes for the mean free path\ncomparable with those obtained from a constant imaginary potential\nof \u00ff4 eV. Thus the HL potential will give good results for free\nelectrons injected into the material which see the average potential.\nThe mean free path for both the HL potential and the average HL\npotential goes to in\u00aenity below the minimum plasmon excitation\nenergy where no inelastic scattering events are possible.\nTo emphasize this result, the radially dependent HL potential is\nincorrect. It predicts values for the mean free path of internally\nproduced photoelectrons which are much too small. The average HL\npotential, on the other hand, gives values which agree tolerably well\nwith experiment. It is the constant density, r independent, imaginary\npart of the HL potential (equivalent to the average HL potential)\nthat, for example, Rehr & Albers (2000) have claimed to give good\nagreement with the experimentally found mean free paths.\nExtensions to the HL potential incorporating a proper treatment\nof the core-hole and multiple electron excitations, have been\nproposed [see, for example, Fujikawa et al. (2000); Natoli et al.\n(1990)], and have even been used for data analysis (Wu et al., 1996).\nHowever, the implementation of these methods is still far from\nroutine and we are unaware of any practical alternatives to the use of\nthe HL potential for data \u00aetting at present.\n4. Conclusion\nIn this paper we have presented a systematic study of the effect of the\nimaginary part of the Hedin\u00b1Lundqvist exchange and correlation\npotential on the calculated EXAFS amplitude. An expression has\nbeen derived whereby the amplitudes given by an imaginary potential\nmay be evaluated independently of the full EXAFS function. These\namplitudes are then compared with \u00aetted values for the EXAFS\namplitude reduction parameters obtained from experimental data\nusing EXCURV98.\nWe \u00aend that the HL potential overestimates the losses to the\nEXAFS due to the \u00aenite photoelectron mean free path alone.\nHowever, it happens to give excellent agreement with the total\nexperimental losses in the energy range of most EXAFS data\nanalysis.\nEmpirically the HL potential seems to account for all of the losses\nto the EXAFS amplitudes. It should therefore not be necessary to use\nthe amplitude \u00aetting parameters s2o and VPI when data \u00aetting using\nthis potential.\nHowever, the HL potential is `merely a phenomenological model\nthat happens to work for the EXAFS' (Tyson, 1991); by no means\ndoes it rigorously describe all the processes contributing to the\ninelastic scattering of the photoelectron. Effectively the HL potential\nunderestimates the mean free path of the photoelectron leading to\nsome ad hoc inclusion of the intrinsic effects. It is therefore possible\nthat some further \u00aetting of the amplitude using the variable para-\nmeters will be necessary when using the HL potential for EXAFS\ncalculations.\nReferences\nAmiss, J. & Gurman, S.
