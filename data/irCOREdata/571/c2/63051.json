Introduction 19 \nKey to understanding the nature and causes of Neoproterozoic climate fluctuations 20 \nand links with biological evolution is our ability to precisely correlate and sequence 21 \ndisparate stratigraphic sections. Relative ages of events can be established within 22 \nsingle sections or by regional correlation using litho-, chemo- and\/or biostratigraphy.  23 \nHowever, relative chronologies do not allow testing of the synchroneity of events, the 24 \nvalidity of correlations or determining rates of change\/duration of events. At present, 25 \nthe major limitation to our understanding of the Neoproterozoic Earth System is the 26 \ndearth of high-precision, high-accuracy, radio-isotopic dates.  However, the increase 27 \nin geochronological constraints over the past five years demonstrates that progress is 28 \nbeing made.   29 \nThis chapter outlines the radio-isotopic dating techniques used for the dating of 30 \n[Neoproterozoic] sedimentary rocks.  It is aimed at the many geologists, climate 31 \nmodellers, palaeobiologists and geophysicists, who use Neoproterozoic 32 \ngeochronology, especially those less familiar with the process of obtaining a date 33 \nfrom a rock.  We provide an outline of the strengths, weaknesses and limitations of 34 \nthe different techniques as well as critical evaluation of the assumptions that underpin 35 \nthe accuracy and precision of the calculated dates and uncertainties.  There is an 36 \nemphasis on U-Pb (zircon) geochronology that reflects it\u2019s prevalence in the current 37 \npublished literature.  We have also tried to place an emphasis on the \u2018isochron 38 \ngeochronometers\u2019 (Re-Os, Lu-Hf and Pb-Pb) applied directly to sedimentary rocks as 39 \nthey are proving to be critical in the direct dating of sedimentary using that are devoid 40 \nof extrusive igneous rocks.  Although the K-Ar and 40Ar\/39Ar are mainstays of 41 \nPhanerozoic timescale calibration, there are few examples where they have been 42 \napplied to Neoproterozoic strata.  This is most likely due to the susceptibility of K 43 \nbearing minerals to alteration and argon loss.  44 \n 45 \n2. Dateable rocks and minerals  46 \nTraditionally the absolute age of sedimentary successions are determined via radio-47 \nisotopic dating of uranium and potassium bearing minerals (zircon and sanidine) from 48 \nvolcanic rocks via U-Pb and K-Ar\/40Ar-39Ar techniques.  These minerals crystallise at 49 \n(or close to) the time of the magmatic eruption and therefore the age of the mineral is 50 \n 3\nassumed to approximate the depositional age of the volcanic rock.  It is also possible 51 \nto apply radio-isotopic dating to certain sedimentary deposits (chemical precipitates 52 \nand organic residues) providing they have an elevated parent\/daughter ratio and that 53 \nany initial daughter nuclide can be accounted for (see section 3.2).  54 \n2.1 Dating accessory minerals from volcanic rocks  55 \nZircon (ZrSiO4) is a common accessory mineral in volcanic rocks ranging from lavas 56 \nto air-fall tuffs and is a nearly ubiquitous component of most clastic sedimentary 57 \nrocks.  The most common volcanic rocks in fossil-bearing sequences are air-fall 58 \nlayers deposited in marine settings that range in thickness from a millimeter to many 59 \nmeters. In most of these rocks the primary volcanic material has been altered, 60 \nprobably soon after deposition, to clay minerals in a process that has little effect on 61 \nzircon. The refractory and durable nature of zircon over a wide range of geological 62 \nconditions means that it is likely for zircon to remain a robust indicator of magmatic 63 \nevents even through subsequent metamorphism.  What makes zircon ideal for U-Pb 64 \ndating is that because U has a similar charge and ionic radius to Zr it substitutes 65 \nreadily into the zircon crystal structure (in modest amounts, typically in the 10\u2019s to 66 \nhundreds of ppm range) whereas Pb has a different charge and larger ionic radius 67 \nleading to its effective disclusion from the crystal lattice.  Therefore at t0 there is 68 \neffectively no Pb present in the crystal (although mineral and fluid inclusions may 69 \ncontain both common and radiogenic Pb).  An additional factor that makes zircon 70 \nsuch a robust chronometer is its high closure temperature (>900\u00b0C), the temperature 71 \nbelow the zircons are effectively sealed and U and Pb do not undergo thermally 72 \nactivated volume diffusion.  This means that zircons preserve their primary ages even 73 \nin volcanic rocks contained in amphibolite facies metasedimentary successions (e.g., 74 \nHoffmann et al., 2004). 75 \nThe refractory and durable nature of zircon means that it is often recycled through 76 \ncrustal processes of erosions, metamorphism and magmatism, which combined with 77 \nits high closure temperature means that it is possible to inherit older zircon in newly 78 \nformed igneous rocks.   This commonly occurs as older cores surrounded by a rim of 79 \nyounger, magmatic zircon.  Such grains pose an analytical challenge in that the 80 \ndifferent domains need to be analysed separately, which is best achieved using either 81 \nmicrobeam techniques (see section 4.2) that employ ion beams and lasers to micro-82 \n 4\nsample different domains within a single zircon crystal or micro sampling of single 83 \ngrains followed by conventional analysis.   84 \nA further complication arises when one considers that the crystallization history of a 85 \nmagma is not always an instantaneous event and that in certain circumstances (such as 86 \nlarge volume silicic eruptions) zircons may crystallize several tens of thousands of 87 \nyears prior to eruption and\/or over a protracted interval.  Furthermore, in long-lived 88 \nmagmatic systems it is possible that older material is cannibalized and that zircons in 89 \nan air fall tuff may record a continuum of dates from eruption up to several million 90 \nyears before.  In such situations high-precision single grain analyses are required in 91 \norder to deconvolve the complexity within a population and to assign an age to the 92 \nsample.          93 \nIt is also possible to date other accessory phases from volcanic ahs beds such as 94 \nmonazite and titanites, however these are much less common in their occurrence than 95 \nzircon.  Monazite [(LREE)PO4] is typical of peraluminous magmas and metamphic 96 \nrocks, however it also rarely found in volcanic ash beds (reference).  Monazite has a 97 \nsimilarly high closure temperature (>900\u00b0C) to zircon and in addition to incorporating 98 \nuranium into its crystal lattice will incorporate ThO2 at the percent level making it 99 \nideally suited to Th-Pb dating.  Titanite (sphene) (CaTiSiO5) is a common accessory 100 \nphases in metamorphic rocks, and somewhat less common in plutonic and volcanic 101 \nrocks.  The advantage of titanite is that it has a moderate closure temperature (ca. 102 \n650\u00b0C) that means it does not accumulate Pb until it cools below that temperature.  In 103 \nthe case of volcanic rocks equates to the eruption event and therefore pre-eruptive 104 \nresidence of titanite is not a limiting factor for its use in dating volcanic eruptions.  105 \nUnfortunately, titanite also incorporates some Pb into its crystal structure resulting in 106 \nmoderate initial common Pb that limits the precision of titanite U\/Pb dates. 107 \n2.2 Dating chemical precipitates and organic residues 108 \nIt is becoming increasingly apparent that chemically precipitated rocks and organic 109 \nresidues from sedimentary rocks can serve as chronometers using the isochron 110 \napproach and calculated dates are interpreted to approximate the time of 111 \nsedimentation and\/or early diagenesis.  The most commonly applied chronometers in 112 \nNeoproterozoic rocks include carbonates, phosphates and organic-rich shales, as they 113 \ncontain high concentrations of the various parent nuclides (Re, U and Lu etc.).   114 \n 5\n2.2.1 U-Pb dating of carbonates  115 \nAt the time of formation, carbonates can incorporate uranium into their crystal lattice, 116 \ntypically with several parts per million (ppm) concentration (although in some cases 117 \nthis can be many tens of ppm), as well as (initial) Pb with concentrations typically in 118 \nthe ppb range, and therefore have the potential for U-Pb dating.  Carbonates form in a 119 \nvariety of terrestrial and marine environments however Neoproterozoic successions 120 \ntargeted for U-Pb dating are invariably marine.  Fluid mediated recrystallisation of 121 \ncarbonates is a common processes during burial and metamorphism and very few (if 122 \nany) Neoproterozoic carbonates are pristine.  Whilst fluids are unlikely to cause 123 \nisotopic fractionation the variable solubility of Pb and U means that it is common for 124 \nthe two to become uncoupled, in which case the U-Pb systematics are somewhat 125 \nunreliable and the Pb-Pb system is relied upon for age information.  Several studies 126 \nhave generated Pb-Pb isochrons from Neoproterozoic successions with varying 127 \nsuccess and most studies finding significant evidence for disturbance of the Pb-Pb 128 \nsystematics during subsequent burial\/metamorphic events (Babinski et al., 1999; 129 \nBabinski et al., 2007).  Recent studies have been successfully employing combined 130 \ntextural and Sr isotope analyses of the carbonates as an independent proxy for 131 \ndisturbance during fluid flow events (Babinski et al., 2007). 132 \n2.2.2 Re-Os dating of organic-rich sediments  133 \nBoth Re and Os become concentrated within anoxic sediments by redox reactions 134 \nclose to the sediment-water interface and are known to be incorporated in the organic 135 \nmatter of organic rich shales (Creaser et al., 2002).  Furthermore, both Re and Os are 136 \napparently hydrogenous in nature and following deposition they can act as a closed 137 \nsystem allowing for their exploitation for geochronology.  In the past 5 years the Re-138 \nOs geochronometer has been applied been applied to several organic rich 139 \nNeoproterozoic stratigraphic intervals (Kendall et al., 2006; Kendall et al., 2004; 140 \nSchaefer and Burgess, 2003).  Studies of the greenschist facies Old Fort Point 141 \nFormation (Kendall et al., 2004) suggests that Re-Os systematics can remain coherent 142 \nduring low grade metamorphism.  143 \n2.2.3 U-Pb and Lu-Hf dating of phosphates 144 \nPhosphates are known for their enrichment (relative to the fluid from which they 145 \nprecipitate) in rare earth elements (REE), thorium and uranium thus allowing for 146 \n 6\npotential use as geochronometer through exploitation of the Lu-Hf, Th-Pb and U-Pb 147 \ndecay schemes.  Few studies have yet to exploit the Lu-Hf and U-Pb system for the 148 \ndating of sedimentary phosphates.  Barfod et al (Barfod et al., 2002) presented a 149 \ncombined U-Pb and Lu-Hf isochron study of the Douhantuo phosphorites obtaining a 150 \nLu-Hf \u2018isochrons\u2019 at ca. 600 Ma (uncertainties of 26 to 81 Ma and MSWDs from 2.0 151 \nto 25) and a Pb-Pb isochron of 599.3 \u00b1 4.2 Ma (n = 5, MSWD = 2.9).  These dates are 152 \nconsistent with U-Pb zircon dates from the top and bottom of the Doushantuo 153 \nformation (Condon et al., 2005), however all \u2018isochrons\u2019 recorded excess scatter.  154 \nThis scatter was attributed to the presence of detrital clays that were not fully 155 \neliminated despite sample pre-treatment to remove clay fractions.  156 \nIn addition to dating \u2018bulk\u2019 phosphates, both monazite and xenotime (YPO4) are 157 \nknown to form during early diagenesis (Evans et al., 2002; Rasmussen, 2005).  Both 158 \nminerals have highly favourable U\/Pb systematics and are robust phases however 159 \ntheir form within the sediments makes them difficult to analyse.  Xenotime occurs as 160 \nsyntaxial overgrowths on zircons but due to their small size (a few 10\u2019s of \u03bcm), and 161 \ntextural complexity, an in-situ isotopic technique with a spatial resolution of <10 \u03bcm 162 \nis required to successfully date xenotime; to date, this has only been achieved by ion 163 \nmicroprobe.  In addition, precipitation of xenotime also occurs during fluid and 164 \nthermal events adding a further layer of complication if the timing of sedimentation is 165 \nthe target.  In contrast to xenotime, diagenetic monazite tends to occur as nodules (up 166 \nto 2mm diameter) in shales.  Studies of Palaeozoic diagenetic monazites nodules have 167 \ndemonstrated that the Pb-Pb and Th-Pb systems are robust however the U-Pb has 168 \nbeen perturbed indicating U remobilization (Evans et al., 2002).  Neither (diagenetic) 169 \nmonazite or xenotime U-Pb geochronology have (yet) been successfully have been 170 \nsuccessfully applied to the dating of a Neoproterozoic sedimentary succession. 171 \nThe \u2018isochron geochronometers\u2019 are invaluable for obtaining age information from 172 \nsedimentary successions devoid of volcanic material that can be dated by the U-Pb 173 \nzircon method.  Despite the large uncertainties intrinsic to the dating of these types of 174 \nmaterials, techniques such as the Pb-Pb isochron method are providing critical in 175 \nproviding age information for stratigraphic intervals that are devoid of volcanic units 176 \nfor U-Pb (zircon) dating (Babinski et al., 2007; Barfod et al., 2002).  Uncertainties on 177 \nRe-Os isochron dates are now yielding uncertainties comparable to U-Pb (zircon) 178 \nmicrobeam dates.  Issues relating to the isochron geochronometers are centred around 179 \n 7\nthe lack an independent check on open-system behaviour.  Quite often the MSWD 180 \nand agreement with existing constraints are used to assess accuracy, if ages are 181 \nyounger than a minimum age constraint then the isochron date must reflect a fluid 182 \nevent.  For the Pb-Pb method applied to carbonates, the evaluation of the Sr isotopes 183 \nmay serve as a good proxy for disturbance (or lack thereof). 184 \n 185 \n2.3 Maximum and minimum age constraints  186 \nNot all sedimentary successions are amenable to direct dating via radio-isotopic 187 \nmethods.  In the absence of zircon bearing volcanic rocks, or chemical sediments for 188 \nisochron dating, another approach is to obtain maximum age constraints by the dating 189 \nof detrital zircons.  Detrital zircons in clastic rocks can range from being considerably 190 \nolder than the estimated age of the sedimentary rock they are contained within (often 191 \nmany hundreds of millions of years older) to close to the age of sedimentation and in 192 \nthis case can provide valuable constraints (Bingen et al., 2005).  Minimum age 193 \nconstraints can be provided by overlying strata (which may contain age-diagnostic 194 \nfossils) and\/or cross-cutting igneous intrusions.  If a radio-isotopic date provides the 195 \nage control then the issues outlined in this chapter will apply.  When the radio-196 \nisotopic constraint is somewhat temporally distant from the presumed age of the 197 \nsediment there is a tendency to ignore the age uncertainties but this can sometimes be 198 \nmisleading (see section 5 for further discussion).    199 \n 200 \n3. Radio-isotopic geochronometers 201 \nA relatively small number of radioactive decay systems are suitable for dating 202 \nNeoproterozoic rocks due to their long half-lives and are listed in table 1.  All of these 203 \nsystems are based upon the radioactive decay of a parent nuclide to a stable daughter 204 \nnuclide. Exploiting these decay systems for the purposes of determining the age of a 205 \nmineral or rock is dependent upon (1) the decay constant of the parent nuclide must 206 \nbe accurately and precisely determined; (2) closed system behaviour, which can be 207 \nsimply stated to mean there has been no loss or gain of parent or daughter nuclide 208 \nsince formation (or \u2018closure\u2019) of the material, and (3) the initial daughter nuclide, if 209 \npresent, can be precisely and accurately accounted for.  In this section we outline the 210 \nbasic principles of the various radio-isotopic geochronometers, differentiating the U-211 \n 8\nPb system applied to U-bearing accessory minerals from the isochron 212 \ngeochronometers (Re-Os, Lu-Hf, Pb-Pb etc.) applied to chemical precipitates and 213 \norganic residues. 214 \nRadioactive \nParent Nuclide \nRadiogenic \nDaughter Nuclide Half life (yrs) \n238U 206Pb 4.468 x 109 \n235U 207Pb 7.038 x 108 \n187Re 187Os 4.16 x 1010 \n176Lu 176Hf 3.71 x 1010 \n87Rb 86Sr 4.944 x 1010 \n40K 40Ar, 40Ca 1.25 x 109 \nTable 1.  Radiometric decay systems used in geochronology. 215 \n 216 \n3.1 Uranium-Lead 217 \nU-Pb geochronology is often regarded as the gold standard of geochronology because 218 \nunlike all other chronometers it exploits two independent decay schemes, 235U to 219 \n207Pb and 238U to 206Pb and 238U and 235U decay constants are relatively precise (Jaffey 220 \net al., 1971).  Two separate dates for a zircon based on each individual decay schemes 221 \nmay be calculated and visualised using the concordia diagram (Fig. 1).  On a 222 \nconventional (Wetherill) concordia diagram the X and Y axis are the 207Pb\/235U and 223 \n206Pb\/238U ratios respectively, and the concordia curve represents the simultaneous 224 \nsolution of the decay equations for a given age.  A third 207Pb-206Pb date can be 225 \ndetermined from only Pb isotopic measurements through knowing both the 235U and 226 \n238U decay constants and the present day 235U\/238U ratio which is assumed invariant at 227 \nca. 137.88.  Calculation of the U\/Pb dates requires determination of the Pb*\/U ratio 228 \n(Pb* denotes radiogenic Pb) and the corresponding decay U constant.  See Fig. 1 for 229 \nage equations. 230 \nThe advantage of two independent chronometers in the same mineral is that it is 231 \npossible to detect small amounts of open system behaviour such as Pb loss or the 232 \ninheritance of older material.  This is a major factor in our ability to make reliable, 233 \nhigh-precision age determinations as we can evaluate whether a number of analyses 234 \nrepresents a time of mineral growth.  The different half lives of 238U and 235U, ca. 4.5 235 \n 9\nand ca. 0.7 Ga respectively, combined with their varying abundances in nature, means 236 \nthat much smaller amounts of 207Pb are produced per increment of time in the 237 \nNeoproterozoic.  Although all three dates can be calculated from most published 238 \nanalyses, the relative precisions are related to the analytical technique employed (see 239 \nsection 5 for further discussion of age uncertainties).  The U-Pb method is most-often 240 \napplied to U-bearing accessory minerals such as zircon found in igneous rocks but it 241 \nhas also been applied to both carbonates and phosphorites using Pb-Pb isochrones 242 \nwhere the initial Pb contribution is significant. 243 \n 244 \nFigure 1. U-Pb (Wetherill) concordia diagram for the age range 542 to 1000 Ma.  The grey band 245 \nrepresents the concordia cure plotted to reflect the uncertainties in the 235U and 238U decay constants.  246 \nUnfilled ellipses are plotted at 50 Myr intervals.  \u03bb = decay constant. 247 \n 248 \nAssuming that zircon crystallization and deposition of an ash are approximately 249 \nsimultaneous, is it correct to assume that the calculated radio-isotopic dates be 250 \nassumed to accurately date the time of zircon crytallisation or stated another way, has 251 \nthe zircon remained a closed system?  It has been known for several decades that 252 \nzircons often show evidence for post-crystallisation Pb-loss.  This has the effect of 253 \n 10\nlowering the U\/Pb ratios and the derived dates (see Fig. 2).  In order to 254 \nminimise\/eliminate the effects of post-crystallisation Pb-loss it is possible to subject 255 \nzircons to pre-treatment techniques in order to physically remove the domains that 256 \nhave suffered Pb-loss thus increasing the probability of closed system behaviour.  The 257 \nfirst approach was to physically abrade away the exterior portions of the zircons 258 \n(Krogh, 1982a), based on the observation that the outer portions were richest in U and 259 \nthus susceptible to radiation damage and Pb-loss.  At the same time Krogh (Krogh, 260 \n1982b) also suggested the selection of the most non-magnetic zircons as they 261 \ncorresponded to lowest U contents and had least amount of Pb-loss.  These 262 \napproaches were widely applied until the development of a new technique described 263 \nas \u2018chemical abrasion\u2019 (Mattinson, 2005).  This technique involves annealing zircon 264 \ngrains at 800-900 \u00b0C followed by partial dissolution.  This method effectively \u201cmines 265 \nout\u201d the higher U parts of the zircon that have been damaged by radiation and are thus 266 \nsusceptible to fast-pathway diffusion of Pb from the zircon crystal.  This method 267 \nseems to offer the promise of total elimination of open system behaviour in most 268 \nzircon. Microbeam techniques (see section 4.1.2) have not typically employed pre-269 \ntreatment techniques as they assume that Pb-loss is restricted to the exterior portions 270 \nof grains which they attempt to avoid during the in-situ analyses. 271 \n 272 \n 11\nFigure. 2.  Schematic U-Pb concordia diagram illustrating the 206Pb\/238U, 207Pb\/235U and 207Pb\/206Pb 273 \ndates can be calculated.  The data presented is a subset of analyses from sample WM54 (Bowring et al., 274 \n2007).  Uncertainties are the 2\u03c3 internal uncertainties those in parenthesis are the 2\u03c3 internal plus the 275 \nsystematic decay constant uncertainties; 0.11% for 238U and 0.14% for 235U (Jaffey et al., 1971).  The 276 \ngrey band is the concordia line plotted to reflect the uncertainties in the U decay constants. Error 277 \nellipses (white) are plotted with 2\u03c3 internal uncertainties, black error bars represent 2\u03c3 internal plus the 278 \nsystematic decay constant uncertainties.  279 \n 280 \n3.2 \u2018Isochron goechronometers\u2019 (Re-Os, Lu-Hf, Pb-Pb etc.).  281 \nThe isochron method involves the analyses of multiple cogenetic samples (minerals or 282 \nsub-samples of a rock from a stratigraphic interval) and is used when an initial 283 \namount of daughter atoms may be present and there is the possibility of a range in 284 \nParent\/daughter.  This is the situation for the Re-Os, Lu-Hf and U-Pb chronometers 285 \napplied to carbonates, phosphates and organic-rich shales which tend to incorporate 286 \nan both parent and daughter isotopes at the time of their formation.  Ideally, the 287 \nisochron approach allows determination of both an age and an initial isotopic 288 \ncomposition of the daughter element that can be used to identify its source (i.e., 289 \nmantle vs crust) and track changes in seawater chemistry. 290 \nFor multiple, cogenetic samples to preserve the time of system closure, samples must 291 \nbegin with (1) a homogenous initial daughter isotopic composition, and (2) a spread in 292 \nparent\/daughter ratio such that over time different samples with a range in 293 \nparent\/daughter will fall on a straight line whose slope is equal to e\u03bbt - 1 (Fig. 3). A 294 \ntypical isochron is plotted P\/Dref on the X axis and D*\/Dref on the Y axis, where P is 295 \nthe number of parent atoms in sample, Dref is the number of atoms of a stable 296 \nreference isotope of the daughter element and D* is the total number of radiogenic 297 \ndaughter atoms plus initial atoms of the same isotope (amount of daughter atoms due 298 \nto decay = D* - D0) (Fig. 3).  At the time of sample formation (t0) all samples should 299 \nplot on a horizontal line, however as the parent decays over time (t1, t2, etc.) each 300 \nsample will evolve along a slope of -1 and samples with higher initial parent\/daughter 301 \nratio (P\/Dref) will be displaced the most (Fig. 3) such that the isochron rotates to a 302 \npositive slope.  Assuming closed system behaviour since the formation of the sample, 303 \na linear regression through the points allows calculation of the slope and y-intercept 304 \nfrom which the age and the initial isotopic composition of the daughter can be 305 \ndetermined (Fig. 3).   306 \n 12\n  307 \nFigure 3.

D0 is the initial amount of the daughter isotope and D* is the 310 \nradiogenic daughter isotope (from decay and initial) such that the daughter produced solely from decay 311 \n(since t0) = D*-D0.    312 \n 313 \n4. Analytical methodolgies 314 \nThe majority of age constraints for Neoproterozoic strata are derived from U-Pb 315 \nzircon dates therefore most of this section is concerned with U-Pb analytical 316 \nmethodologies.  The analytical methodologies used for the \u2018isochron 317 \ngeochronometers\u2019 are somewhat similar to ID-TIMS U-Pb method however the 318 \ndifferences are discussed below.    319 \n4.1 U-Pb methodologies 320 \nThere are two main approaches to U-Pb zircon geochronology: in-situ \u2018microbeam\u2019 321 \ntechniques and isotope dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry (ID-TIMS). The 322 \nmajor difference is that in ID-TIMS geochronology, zircon is dissolved and the U and 323 \nPb separated from the other elements prior to analysis whereas in microbeam 324 \ntechniques the zircon is analyzed by a laser or ion beam in a sectioned and polished 325 \nepoxy mount or thin section.   326 \n4.1.2 U-Pb ID-TIMS  327 \n 13\nID-TIMS analyses of zircon (either as multi-grain fractions, single grains or grain 328 \nfragments) involves dissolution of the zircon in the presence of tracer isotopes called 329 \nisotope dilution.  For U-Pb ID-TIMS analyses the most common tracers are 205Pb and 330 \n235U.  205Pb is an artificial tracer that does not occur in nature whereas 235U is natural 331 \nhowever its abundance to 238U is assumed to be constant with 235U\/238U = 137.88 332 \ntherefore it can be used to determine the number of moles of 238U and 235U.  333 \nFollowing dissolution the sample undergoes chemical purification using anion 334 \nexchange chemistry that allows separation of the Zr and REEs from the Pb and U, and 335 \nPb and U from one another.   336 \nFollowing purification Pb and U are analysed separately by thermal ionisation mass 337 \nspectrometry where the sample isotopes (204Pb, 206Pb, 238U, etc) can be ratio-ed 338 \nagainst the tracer isotope (205Pb, 235U) and the number of atoms of each naturally 339 \noccurring isotope in the sample can be determined. Because the ratio of tracer 340 \nisotopes to isotopes in the rock or mineral are established before any processing, 341 \ninefficient separation of U and Pb and typically low ionisation efficiency of U and Pb 342 \ndo not affect the ratios and ultimately the age. After corrections for mass 343 \nfractionation, the minor contribution of common Pb and U from the reagents, the 344 \ntracer and labware, the sample 206Pb\/207Pb, 206Pb\/238U and 207Pb\/235U ratios can be 345 \ndetermined and 206Pb\/207Pb, 206Pb\/238U and 207Pb\/235U dates calculated.  346 \nOptimisation of this technique means that it is now possible to date zircons with <10 347 \npg radiogenic Pb and obtain precision <0.1% on the U\/Pb ratio for single grain 348 \nanalyses.  However, it is a very time consuming technique, each single U\/Pb analyses 349 \ntakes several hours of mass-spectrometry, making it difficult to develop high-n 350 \ndatasets. 351 \n 352 \n 4.1.3 U-Pb Microbeam techniques 353 \nU-Pb geochronology by microbeam techniques has revolutionized geochronology 354 \nover the past two decades. The two major techniques are Secondary Ion Mass 355 \nSpectrometry (SIMS), typified by the SHRIMP (Sensitive High Resolution Ion 356 \nMicroprobe), and Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry 357 \n(LA-ICP-MS). Both of these techniques (collectively termed \u2018microbeam\u2019 techniques) 358 \noffer high-spatial resolution analyses using either a focused ion beam to sputter a 359 \n 14\nvolume of zircon (SIMS) or a laser that is used to vaporise a volume of zircon (LA-360 \nICP-MS).  Microbeam techniques allow in-situ analysis of very small volumes and 361 \nthus high-spatial resolution; a typical volume of zircon analyzed by an ion-probe is 362 \ncylindrical, 20-30 microns in diameter and several microns deep, with somewhat 363 \nlarger volumes for LA-ICPMS (Kosler and Sylvester, 2003). In addition the analyses 364 \ncan be done relatively rapidly (many 10\u2019s analyses per day for LA-ICPMS and 365 \nSIMS). Furthermore, these techniques allow analysis of remaining mineral for other 366 \nisotopes\/elements of interest (Hf, O, REE\u2019s) can be made on the same zircon grains in 367 \nclose proximity to the volume analyzed for geochronology. 368 \nFundamental to the microbeam U-Pb zircon methods is use of a primary standard 369 \nagainst which the U\/Pb ratio of the unknown zircon is calibrated.  For SIMS 370 \ntechniques this calibration involves the analyses of standard zircon to develop a 371 \ncalibration curve for a known U\/Pb ratio (which is determined via ID-TIMS analyses) 372 \nand against which analyses of unknown zircons can be compared.  This is achieved 373 \nthrough analytical sessions where a standard zircon is repeatedly analysed 374 \ninterspersed with analyses of unknown zircons (this is termed sample-standard 375 \nbracketing). For LA-ICPMS the approach is somewhat similar manner in that sample-376 \nstandard bracketing is employed in order to determine the interelemental fractionation 377 \nwhich is then applied to the unknown zircons.  In both SIMS and LA-ICPMS 378 \ntechniques the 207Pb\/206Pb ratio is a direct measurement, for SIMS mass-dependent 379 \nfractionation appears to be minimal and the measured ratio is commonly used whereas 380 \nin LA-ICPMS analyses mass dependent fractionation is quantifiable and is corrected 381 \nfor either using sample-standard bracketing and\/or using a solution with known 382 \n205Tl\/203Tl ratio to correct for mass bias on Pb isotopic ratios.  For further details of 383 \nmicrobeam techniques see Ireland and Williams (Ireland and Williams, 2003) for a 384 \nreview of SIMS U-Pb geochronology and Kosler and Sylvester (Kosler and Sylvester, 385 \n2003) for a review of LA-ICPMS geochronology. 386 \nThe benefit of the high spatial resolution provided by microbeam techniques is a 387 \ntradeoff in that the precision of individual spot analyses using LA-ICPMS and SIMS 388 \nis lower than ID-TIMS by approximately an order of magnitude (Ireland and 389 \nWilliams, 2003; Kosler and Sylvester, 2003).  In-situ techniques are without question 390 \nessential tools for characterizing complex (zoned) zircons from volcanic and 391 \n 15\nmetamorphic rocks and for characterizing detrital populations which in some cases 392 \ncan provide robust estimates of the minimum age of a sequence.  393 \n4.2 Isochron techniques  394 \nIsochron techniques involve analysis of multiple samples assumed to be the same age, 395 \nhave a spread in parent\/daughter ratio, and have remained closed systems. In order to 396 \nensure the samples are the same age and have the same initial isotopic composition it 397 \nis preferable to sample laterally from the same unit (e.g., (Kendall et al., 2004)), 398 \nminimizing thickness and to avoid integration of samples from a stratigraphic 399 \nthickness. In some cases, such as working with core samples, this is not always 400 \npossible (Kendall et al., 2006).  This could be a complicating factor if there is 401 \ntemporal variation in the initial isotopic composition of the daughter element, and\/or 402 \nrepresents a significant amount of time, especially in condensed sections. 403 \nSample dissolution and purification are similar to the procedures for U-Pb ID-TIMS.  404 \nPrior to isotope ratio mass spectrometry samples undergo dissolution and chemical 405 \npurification.  For multi-element systems (such as Re-Os, U-Pb and Lu-Hf) isotopic 406 \ntracers are added prior to dissolution for the isotope dilution (see above) whereas for 407 \nsingle element systems (such as Pb-Pb), direct measurements of the isotope ratios are 408 \nmade. The isotopic composition is determined via thermal ionization mass-409 \nspectrometry although it is also possible to use solution mode ICPMS for most 410 \nelements.   411 \nThe accuracy and precision of isochron techniques is largely controlled by the quality 412 \nof the rock or mineral itself, primarily a spread in initial parent\/daughter ratio, and 413 \nclosed system behaviour. For precipitates such as carbonates and phosphates there is 414 \noften no significant detrital input however this is not the case for organic rich shales 415 \ntargeted for Re-Os.  Because the organic rich shales contain detrital material there is 416 \npotential that significant concentrations of Os from multiple sources can occur.  This 417 \nhas been demonstrated in several studies (Creaser et al., 2002; Kendall et al., 2004) 418 \nhowever it is possible to limit the detrital Os contribution by selective dissolution of 419 \nthe organic component using CrO3-H2SO4 dissolution approach.  Kendall et al 420 \n(Kendall et al., 2004) compared two dissolution methods (aqua regia vs. CrO3-H2SO4 421 \ndissolution) on greenschist facies organic rich shale from the Old Fort Point 422 \nFormation in Western Canada.  Both dissolution techniques were used on the same 423 \n 16\npowders, however the aqua regia method yielded scattered data and a resulting 424 \n\u201cisochron\u201d regression with an MSWD of 65 and a large \u201cage\u201d uncertainty (9%) in 425 \ncomparison to the CrO3-H2SO4 dissolution method which yielded an isochron with 426 \nmuch less scatter (MSWD = 1.2) and a relatively low uncertainty (0.8% 2\u03c3) (Kendall 427 \net al., 2004).  428 \n 429 \n5. Sources and types of uncertainty 430 \nWithout an accurate estimation of uncertainty, the radio-isotopic age of a given rock 431 \nor mineral is of limited value.  For example, suppose a date of 618 Ma is reported for 432 \na detrital zircon from a unit that underlies a Marinoan-type glacial deposit?  If the date 433 \nis relatively precise (and accurate), say \u00b1 2 Myr, then it could be inferred that the 434 \nonset of glacial sediment accumulation post-dates deposition of the detrital material at 435 \n618 \u00b1 2 Ma. On the other hand, if the 618 Ma date has an uncertainty of 100 Myr then 436 \nthe detrital mineral could be as old as 718 Ma or young as 518 Ma, making it of 437 \nlimited use.  Consider the case where the 618 Ma is the 206Pb\/238U date with an 438 \nuncertainty of 10 Myr but the 207Pb\/206Pb date is 650 \u00b1 400 Ma.   Although the two 439 \ndates overlap the concordia curve (and are therefore technically concordant), the lack 440 \nof precision on the 207Pb\/206Pb date renders it impossible to assess open-system 441 \nbehaviour (such as Pb-loss or inheritance) within the limits imposed by the precision 442 \nof the 207Pb\/206Pb date and thus the accuracy of the 206Pb\/238U date is unknown.  This 443 \nlater example might at first seem extreme but data of this type exist in the published 444 \nliterature and are often cited.  For example, Ireland et al (Ireland et al., 1998) 445 \npublished an extensive dataset of SHRIMP U-Pb zircon dates on detrital zircons from 446 \nthe Kanmantoo Group in Australia (it should be noted that it was not the intention of 447 \nthis study to constrain the timing of sediment accumulation).  The units sampled 448 \nincluded the Marino Arkose where fifty detrital zircons were analysed, the majority of 449 \nwhich were >1 Ga (n =48).  Two grains yielded 206Pb\/238U dates of 649 \u00b1 17 and 655 450 \n\u00b1 17 which many researchers use to indicate that the Marino Arkose is ca. 650 Ma (or 451 \nyounger) (Halverson et al., 2005; Peterson et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2004).  The 452 \n207Pb\/206Pb dates associated with these two analyses are 470 \u00b1 440 Ma and 666 \u00b1 307 453 \nMa respectively.  Statistically it is possible that the two zircons are ca. 650 Ma, but 454 \nthe probability is quite low and it is not legitimate to assume the 206Pb\/238U date is an 455 \naccurate estimate of the age of the zircons without considering both the 206Pb\/238U and 456 \n 17\n206Pb\/207Pb uncertainties.  In practical terms these two detrital zircon dates provide no 457 \nsignificant constraint. 458 \nIt is necessary for anyone who uses geochronological data to understand the various 459 \nsources of error and when one must consider the total uncertainty of a given date as 460 \nopposed to it\u2019s constituent parts. Although the uncertainty of each date contains an 461 \ninternal\/random component in the total uncertainty, there are also components that are 462 \nsystematic (such as those related to the decay constants).  In some circumstances these 463 \ncan be ignored offering a potential increase in resolving power.  In this section we 464 \nreview the different sources of uncertainties and the assumptions that underlie the 465 \noften quoted (or not) errors.  For more detailed treatment of uncertainties in 466 \ngeochronology the following articles are recommended: Ireland and Williams (Ireland 467 \nand Williams, 2003); Stern and Amelin (Stern and Amelin, 2003), Schmitz and 468 \nSchoene (Schmitz and Schoene, 2007), and various papers by Ludwig (Ludwig, 1980, 469 \n1991, 1998, 2003).     470 \n5.1 Random\/internal uncertainties 471 \nRandom\/internal uncertainties can be considered as those relating to the measurement 472 \nof isotopic ratios of the sample, standards and blank and are used in the derivation of 473 \nthe radiogenic ratios. Most of these sources of random uncertainty relate to the mass-474 \nspectrometry and our ability to measure isotopic ratios with precision and accuracy.  475 \nFactors such as the electronic noise of detectors place a theoretical limit on the 476 \nprecision which can be achieved by detecting a certain number of ions over a finite 477 \nperiod of time.  However for almost all geochronologic applications other factors such 478 \nas correction for mass dependent fractionation that occurs during sample ionisation, 479 \nand correction for common and\/or initial parent and daughter nuclide dominate the 480 \nanalytical uncertainty budget.  It is possible to reduce the uncertainty in the mass 481 \ndependent fractionation via \u2018double-spiking\u2019, where two tracer isotopes of the same 482 \nelement (202Pb-205Pb, or 233U-235U for example) are used for real time mass 483 \nfractionation correction.   484 \nThe analytical uncertainties associated with U-Pb ID-TIMS dates have decreased 485 \nsubstantially over the past decade.  This is due in large part to a reduction in the 486 \ncommon Pb levels introduced in the laboratory, as the isotopic composition of this 487 \ncommon Pb is imprecisely determined (due to it\u2018s variability), therefore the reduction 488 \n 18\nin common Pb levels reduces the uncertainty associated with the common Pb 489 \ncorrection.  The nature of SIMS and LA-ICPMS (in \u2018dry\u2019 mode) analyses means that 490 \ncommon Pb levels are intrinsically low. 491 \n5.1.1 Microbeam U\/Pb standardisation 492 \nMicrobeam U-Pb dating of zircons is a relative analytical technique where dates are 493 \ncalculated relative to a standard zircon of known age.  Microbeam U-Pb data are 494 \nacquired in analytical sessions where the unknown zircons are analysed in 495 \nconjunction with the standard zircon of known age.  The raw measured U\/Pb ratio of 496 \nthe standard varies or \u201cdrifts\u201d during an analytical session due to slight changes in 497 \ninstrument parameters.  Therefore there is an uncertainty associated with the Pb\/U 498 \nstandardisation that has to be considered.  This uncertainty is on the order to 1% 499 \n(Stern and Amelin, 2003), however the accuracy of its quantification is dependent 500 \nupon the number and frequency with which the standard is analysed.  501 \nThere are differences of opinion on how the uncertainty related to the U\/Pb 502 \nstandardisation is factored into the total uncertainty of a date.  Some groups consider 503 \nthat the \u2018standardisation\u2019 value is constant for a given session and therefore the 504 \nuncertainty is systematic and needs only be considered when comparing data 505 \ncollected in different analytical sessions (if this is correct then the session Pb\/U 506 \nuncertainty can be simply added to the weighted mean uncertainty in a manner 507 \nanalogous to the ID-TIMS tracer calibration uncertainty).  Conversely, other groups 508 \nconsider that the reproducibility of the standard is a reflection of the external 509 \nreproducibility of all analyses and that this uncertainty should be incorporated into the 510 \nuncertainty of each individual analyses of an unknown zircon (Ireland and Williams, 511 \n2003; Stern and Amelin, 2003).  This results in a reduction in the MSWD and has 512 \nimplications for the identification of outliers (Ireland and Williams, 2003).  513 \nInformation regarding the approach taken to the standardisation uncertainty is often 514 \nrecorded in the footnotes to the data table or in the data repository but can be crucial 515 \nwhen trying to precisely sequence rocks or calculate durations of events. 516 \nTypical internal (2\u03c3) uncertainties for ID-TIMS 207Pb\/206Pb and 206Pb\/238U dates are 517 \nca. 0.5-0.2% and ca. 0.1-0.05 % respectively, and for microbeam techniques internal 518 \n(2\u03c3) uncertainties on 207Pb\/206Pb and 206Pb\/238U dates are ca. 3-5% and ca. 1-2% 519 \nrespectively.   520 \n 19\n5.2 Systematic\/external uncertainties 521 \nSystematic uncertainties are those related to the uncertainty in absolute value of 522 \nvarious constant parameters used in the calculation of either an isotopic ratio or in the 523 \ncalculation of the date itself.   524 \n5.2.1 Decay constants 525 \nOne source of systematic uncertainty that affects all radio-isotopic dates are those 526 \nrelated to the uncertainty in the decay constants (Table 1).   Three approaches have 527 \nbeen taken to determine the decay constants (the probability that a given atom will 528 \ndecay per unit of time) of the long-lived radionuclide; (1) direct counting; (2) 529 \ningrowth and (3) geological comparison.  Direct counting involves the detection of 530 \nalpha, beta or gamma activity relative to the total number of radioactive atoms.  531 \nIngrowth relies upon the quantification of a decay product that is accumulated from a 532 \nquantity of high-purity parent nuclide over a well-defined period of time. Geologic 533 \ncomparison involves the analyses of cogeneitc materials with multiple chronometers, 534 \nknowing that each chronometer should yield an equivalent date.  This approach has 535 \nthe potential for relative intercalibration of the decay constants but accurate 536 \nintercalibration requires that at least one decay constant is accurate and known with 537 \nsome precision.  This is usually assumed to be the 238U and 235U due to the precision 538 \nwith which the decay constants have been determined (Jaffey et al., 1971) and the 539 \ninternal check provided by closed system zircon analyses (Mattinson, 2000; Schoene 540 \net al., 2006).   541 \nThe counting experiments of Jaffey et al (1971) determined the 238U and 235U decay 542 \nconstants with uncertainties of 0.11% and 0.14% respectively.  These values have 543 \nbeen adopted for use in geochronology (Steiger and Jager, 1977).  The 187Re and 176Lu 544 \ndecay constants have been determined by both direct counting experiment and 545 \nthrough geologic comparison with the U-Pb system and uncertainties are estimated at 546 \nca. 0.4 to 0.5% (Scherer et al., 2001; Selby et al., 2007). 547 \nThe incorporation of decay constant uncertainties are becoming increasingly 548 \nimportant as both the internal precision of dates is reduced and multiple 549 \ngeochronometers are being used to investigate the same time intervals.  The decay 550 \nconstant uncertainties for isochron dates are typically <20% of the total uncertainty 551 \nbudget, in contrast the uncertainties in the U decay constants are often >50% of the 552 \n 20\ntotal uncertainty budget of U\/Pb ID-TIMS dates (Fig. 2).   The situation for the ID-553 \nTIMS U\/Pb community is that they are now often generating 206Pb\/238U and 554 \n207Pb\/206Pb dates that do not overlap within analytical precision and the U decay 555 \nconstant uncertainties have to be considered (Begemann et al., 2001; Ludwig, 2000).  556 \nAs the \u2018user\u2019 often uses these date interchangeably we are now seeing 206Pb\/238U and 557 \n207Pb\/206Pb age uncertainties as \u00b1 X\/Y\/Z and \u00b1 X\/Z respectively, where X is the 558 \nanalytical\/internal uncertainty, Y is the analytical uncertainty plus the systematic 559 \ntracer calibration uncertainty and Z is the total uncertainty including X, Y and the 560 \ndecay constant uncertainties.  This permits use of the data with the level of 561 \nuncertainty that is appropriate to the problem being addressed. 562 \n5.2.2 Age of primary standards for microbeam U\/Pb dating 563 \nAs discussed above, U-Pb microbeam techniques rely upon measurement of the U\/Pb 564 \nratio relative to standard minerals of known age.  The U\/Pb dates of these minerals are 565 \ndetermined via ID-TIMS analyses with typical total uncertainties of 0.1 to 0.3% 566 \nwhich should be propagated into the total uncertainty of the final U\/Pb microbeam 567 \ndate.  Since the systematic uncertainty related to the age of the primary standard is 568 \nabout an order of magnitude less than the random errors related to the dating of the 569 \nunknown mineral and often not considered.   570 \nIntra- and inter-crystal homogeneity is a fundamental requirement of a zircon standard 571 \nfor microbeam U\/Pb geochronology as the U\/Pb ratio of the standard is considered 572 \ninvariant.  Isotopic homogeneity is assessed by multiple ID-TIMS analyses on single 573 \ncrystals and\/or crystal fragments (Black et al., 2003; Schmitz et al., 2003) and assess 574 \nvariability on a microgram scale, however microbeam techniques require standards 575 \nthat are homogeneous on the sub-micron scale.  At present zircons standards are either 576 \nchips of megacrysts (e.g., SL13 and 91500) or multi-crystal mineral separates from 577 \nplutonic rocks (e.g., Temora).  In general the zircon standards are relatively 578 \nhomogenous (at the level that can be detected by either microgram ID-TIMS analyses 579 \nor nanogram SIMS analyses) however there has been issues with at least one of the 580 \nmegacryst standards (SL13) which is heterogeneous at the micron-scale (Ireland and 581 \nWilliams, 2003).  The fact that all zircon standards are natural means they are not 582 \nideal as they are likely to be affected by zonation and\/or Pb-loss and\/or other (matrix 583 \nrelated) differences which may occur below the level of quantification.  584 \n 21\n5.2.3 Calibrating tracers for isotope-dilution 585 \nFor isotopic analyses that use the addition of isotopic tracers (isotope dilution), the 586 \naccuracy of the tracer calibration (isotopic composition and concentrations) has a 587 \nmajor control on the accuracy of the derived dates for a mineral or rock.  Calibration 588 \nof tracers is performed through admixing the tracer with another solution of known 589 \nisotopic composition and, importantly, known purity. High-purity metals or salts (see 590 \n(Selby et al., 2007), for details of a Re-Os tracer; Condon et al., in prep, for details of 591 \na U\/Pb tracer calibration) are used as the basis the gravimetric reference solutions 592 \nagainst which the concentration of the tracer isotope can be determined, therefore the 593 \npurity of the metal or salt, and the accuracy of the weighing prior to dissolution, 594 \ncontrols the precision and accuracy of the calibration.  This total uncertainty is 595 \ntypically estimated at ca. 0.1%.  For multi-element tracers the elemental (i.e., U\/Pb) 596 \nratio is fixed therefore the uncertainty in the tracer calibration is systematic and can be 597 \nignored for the practical purposes of age determinations generated using the same 598 \ntracer.  This is particularly useful when attempting to determine the relative time 599 \ndifference between samples such as determining sediment accumulation rates 600 \n(Bowring et al., 2007), or assessing synchroneity of events (Condon et al., 2005).  At 601 \npresent it is typical that each isotope laboratory has their own tracer therefore the 602 \ntracer uncertainty has to be considered when comparing dates with other labs and 603 \nother techniques.  Recently the U\/Pb ID-TIMS community has made an effort to 604 \neliminate this inter-laboratory uncertainty through the development and calibration of 605 \na large amount of 205Pb-233U-235U tracer for community use under the auspices of the 606 \nEARTHTIME Initiative (Condon et al., in prep). 607 \n5.3 Calculating an age from multiple dates 608 \nA significant proportion of age constraints for Neoproterozoic strata are U-Pb dates 609 \non zircons from extrusive (volcanic) or intrusive igneous rocks.  The final reported 610 \ndate and associated uncertainty are commonly weighted mean dates derived from a 611 \nnumber (n) of individual dates on different zircons (or zircon sub-domains), and 612 \ncommonly calculated using the algorithms in the Isoplot software (Ludwig, 1991).  613 \nThis is the case for data acquired using both ID-TIMS and microbeam techniques.  614 \nThe weighted mean is favoured as it weights each individual an analyses (such as a 615 \nsingle SIMS spot or single grain ID-TIMS analyses) according to its precision so 616 \nanalyses with a low uncertainty (high weight) contribute more to the weighted mean 617 \n 22\nthan do elements with a high uncertainty (low weight).  Importantly, the use of a 618 \nweighted mean algorithm (or other averaging) is underpinned by the expectation of a 619 \nsingle population with normally distributed errors.  If the errors on the individual 620 \nanalyses are approximately equal (as is typical for microbeam U\/Pb data) then the 621 \nweighted mean uncertainty is proportional to 1\/\u221an, therefore high-n datasets can be 622 \nused to reduce the overall age uncertainty for data collected on a single population 623 \nwith normally distributed errors.  If the uncertainties on the individual analyses are 624 \nvariable (as is common in ID-TIMS U\/Pb data with a range of Pb*\/Pbc ratios) then the 625 \nweighted mean uncertainty is controlled by the few most precise analyses, however 626 \nthe high-n dataset is critical for assessing the spread of dates from a given sample.      627 \nA common measure of the \u201ccoherence\u201d of a data set is a statistical parameter called 628 \nthe MSWD (mean square of the weighted deviates; (York, 1966, 1967). A value of 629 \napproximately 1 indicates that the scatter in the data can be explained by analytical 630 \nuncertainties alone, values much less than 1 indicates that analytical uncertainties 631 \nhave been overestimated, and values greater than 1 can indicate either that the 632 \nuncertainties have been underestimated or that another source of scatter, often called 633 \n\u201cgeological\u201d scatter is present. Although not often explicitly stated, an MSWD of 1 634 \ndoes not necessarily mean there is a single age population. Rather, it indicates that if 635 \nreal age variation is present, it cannot be resolved within the precision of the 636 \nindividual analyses. 637 \n5.4 Uncertainties as a result of geologic complexity 638 \nUncertainty as a result of geologic complexity is the most difficult to quantify.  The 639 \nmost common cause of excess scatter is open system behaviour resulted from either 640 \ninheritance of older zircon or Pb loss.  For U-Pb zircon analyses reduced errors on 641 \nsingle analyses often exposes fine-scale variability that may reflect protracted growth 642 \nof zircon crystals in a magma chamber or the effects of very subtle open system 643 \nbehaviour thus that high-precision analyses do not always transform into reduced 644 \nuncertainties in calculated weighted mean dates. 645 \n5.4.1 Complex U-Pb zircon systematics  646 \nIn the past decade errors associated with ID-TIMS analyses have dropped by almost 647 \nan order of magnitude and while this is good it also exposes complexity at the <0.1 % 648 \nlevel sometimes resulting in scatter and higher values of MSWD.  It is now common 649 \n 23\nfor the geochronologist to be faced with a population of zircon analyses that do not 650 \nform a coherent cluster (MSWD = 1) and the crucial question is how to interpret the 651 \ndata to arrive at a depositional age.  The advent of CA-TIMS pre-treatment for the 652 \nelimination of Pb-loss has been extremely important as it gives one confidence that in 653 \nmany cases Pb-loss need not be considered as a cause of excess scatter.  Furthermore, 654 \nfor Neoproterozoic rocks, the concordia curve has a shallow enough slope, and the 655 \n207Pb\/235U dates measured precisely enough to be able to evaluate discordance at the 656 \nper mil level, however this is not the case for microbeam U\/Pb dates. 657 \nAs outlined above, microbeam U\/Pb dates on volcanic rocks rely upon the averaging 658 \nof a relatively high-n dataset (10-20) of relatively imprecise (ca. 2 to 4%) U\/Pb 659 \ndeterminations to get a weighted mean date with precision ca. 1%.  Underpinning 660 \nthese lower uncertainties is the assumption of a single population with normally 661 \ndistributed errors. However, it is the low precision of each analysis combined with 662 \nvariability of the standard analyses that bracket unknowns that often precludes the 663 \ndetection of subtle amounts of Pb loss or inheritance.  Stated another way, if the 664 \namount of Pb-loss or inheritance is less than the precision of a single spot analyses 665 \nthen it cannot be detected via normal statistical proxies (such as the MSWD) therefore 666 \nthe assumption of a normal distribution maybe be invalid (see Fig. 4).  If Pb-loss is 667 \nthe main source of open-system behaviour, this will have the effect of lowering the 668 \n206Pb\/238U date on some analyses as well as the weighted mean 206Pb\/238U date (Fig. 669 \n4).  The inability to detect small amounts of Pb loss in small volumes of zircon 670 \nanalyzed by microbeam techniques represents a significant limitation for their 671 \napplication to high precision geochronology (Bowring et al., 2006). 672 \n 24\n 673 \nFigure 4. U-Pb concordia and weighted mean 206Pb\/238U plots for a somewhat synthetic dataset.  674 \nPlotted are U\/Pb ratios (A and B) and 206Pb\/238U dates (C and D).  A and C are analyses with typical 2\u03c3 675 \n\u2018microbeam\u2019 (1.5 to 2.5% for 206Pb\/238U and 2.4 to 5.5% for the 207Pb\/235U ratio) the uncertainties 676 \nwhereas B and D are the exact same analyses with typical ID-TIMS uncertainties (0.06 to 0.16% for 677 \n206Pb\/238U and 0.09 to 0.22% for the 207Pb\/235U ratio). Weighted mean ID-TIMS 206Pb\/238U date include 678 \na 0.1% uncertainty in the U\/Pb of the tracer.  All error ellipses and error boxes are plotted at 2\u03c3 level. 679 \n 680 \nIn-situ techniques are without question essential tools for characterizing complex 681 \nzircons from volcanic and metamorphic rocks and for sifting through detrital 682 \npopulations to characterise source areas and in some cases provide robust estimates of 683 \nthe minimum age of a sequence. Ideally, microbeam techniques would be used to 684 \nrapidly characterise a population of zircons by analyzing a small volume of many 685 \nzircons, which could then be followed by conventional high-precision geochronology 686 \nof selected grains. 687 \n5.4.1 Non-simple Isochrons 688 \n 25\nAs outlined above, a limitation of the \u2018isochron geochronometers\u2019 is the lack of an 689 \nindependent check for \u2018open-system\u2019 behaviour, unlike the dual decay scheme of the 690 \nU-Pb system.  Most studies employ a combination of bracketing age constraints 691 \nand\/or a statistical measure of coherence (MSWD or uncertainty) to assess whether 692 \nthe system has been perturbed, however precision and amount of scatter cannot be 693 \nused as a proxy for closed system behaviour.  For example, organic rich sediments 694 \nfrom the Aralka Formation, Australia, have been analysed for Re-Os geochronology 695 \nusing both the aqua regia and CrO3-H2SO4 dissolution methods.  Schaffer and 696 \nBurgess (Schaefer and Burgess, 2003) used the aqua regia dissolution method and 697 \nobtained a 3 point isochron (samples integrated over 1.6 m stratigraphic thickness) of 698 \n592 \u00b1 14 Ma (MSWD << 1).  An expanded dataset collected over 10m stratigraphic 699 \nthickness yielded a 9 point regression and an age of 623 \u00b1 18 Ma (MSWD = 5.2).  700 \nSubsequent Re-Os analyses (on samples from a 2 m interval within the 10m interval 701 \nsampled by Schaffer and Burgess., 2003) using the CrO3-H2SO4 dissolution method 702 \nyielded a 10 point isochron with an age of 657.2 \u00b1 5.4 Ma (2\u03c3 internal uncertainties, 703 \nMSWD = 1.2) (Kendall et al., 2006).  This difference is attributed to either a sampling 704 \nand\/or analytical artefact related to sample digestion (Kendall et al., 2006).  705 \nIt is clear from the Alralka case study that care must be taken when using coherence 706 \nof a dataset as means to assess the accuracy, especially with isochrones based upon 707 \nlow-n datasets.     The bottom line is that a suite of samples with the same initial ratio 708 \nand a range of parent daughter ratios that evolve in a closed system yield an isochron 709 \nbut if a suite of samples define a statistically significant linear array one cannot 710 \nnecessarily infer closed system behaviour as simple mixing of two reservoirs can 711 \nyield linear arrays. 712 \n 713 \n6. Conclusions 714 \n(a) There are a number of radio-isotopic dating techniques that can be employed to 715 \nconstrain the age of a sedimentary succession.  These include U-Pb dating of minerals 716 \nfrom volcanic rocks which date the eruption, to Re-Os or U-Pb \u2018isochron\u2019 dating of 717 \norganic-rich sediments or carbonates.  The suitability of a given technique is governed 718 \nby the geological material.  Most Neoproterozoic age constraints are based upon U-Pb 719 \n 26\nzircon dates from extrusive igneous rocks, this dataset is augmented by a growing 720 \nnumber of Re-Os, Pb-Pb and Lu-Hf isochron dates.    721 \nEach of the radio-isotopic systems have different strengths and weaknesses, maily 722 \nrelating to the specific type of material needed for analyses and its presence in the 723 \nstratigraphic section of interest.  U-Pb (zircon) dating is considered the premier 724 \ngeochronometer however it is of limited use in successions devoid of zircon bearing 725 \nvolcanics.  Realising the goal of a robust and highly-resolved temporal framework for 726 \nthe Neoproterozoic will require exploitation of all these different methodologies.  727 \n(b) All dates are underpinned by a series of assumptions and include a component of 728 \ninterpretation.  Radio-isotopic dates such as U-Pb (zircon) dates from volcanic rocks 729 \nand isochron dates from sediments are based upon datasets that comprise a number of 730 \nseparate analyses.  In the case of U-Pb (zircon) dates from volcanic rocks, the final 731 \nproduct is usually a weighted mean 206Pb\/238U date in which a number (up to ca. 15) 732 \nof single 206Pb\/238U dates (either single grain or single spot analyses) are weighted 733 \n(based upon their associated uncertainty) and a mean calculated.  Underpinning this 734 \nmean date, and its lower uncertainty (about 2 to 4 times lower than the uncertainty on 735 \na single analyses), is the assumption of a single population with normally distributed 736 \nerrors.  Isochron dates are similarly based upon the linear regression through a 737 \nnumber of data points that are assumed to be cogenetic, have a common initial 738 \ndaughter isotopic composition, and that the materials analysed have acted as a \u2018closed 739 \nsystem\u2019 since their formation. 740 \n(c) The uncertainty of the date is no less significant than the date itself.  The total 741 \nuncertainty of a radio-isotopic date comprises random, or internal, and systematic 742 \ncomponents.  The random\/internal uncertainties are related to the measurement of the 743 \nisotopic ratios and the corrections applied. Systematic uncertainties are those related 744 \nto the uncertainty in absolute value of various constant parameters used in the 745 \ncalculation of either an isotopic ratio or in the calculation of the date itself.  Analytical 746 \nuncertainties should reflect the ability to reproduce a given isotopic ratio and 747 \nrepresent the minimum uncertainty that should be considered.  For microbeam U\/Pb 748 \ndates the standard calibration is best considered as a non-systematic uncertainty and 749 \nshould be incorporated into each individual U\/Pb date uncertainty (Ireland and 750 \nWilliams, 2003).  If comparing dates generated using different techniques or using 751 \ndifferent calibration materials (such as mineral standards for microbeam dates of 752 \n 27\nisotopic tracer for ID-TIMS) then the systematic uncertainties related to these 753 \ncalibrations must be considered.  An additional systematic uncertainty is that related 754 \nto the decay constants used in the age calculation.  These uncertainties have been 755 \ndetermined experimentally or assessed via geological comparison with another decay 756 \nscheme.  There is considerable variation in the published literature regarding the 757 \ntreatment of the constituent parts of the total uncertainty budget.  In some cases, such 758 \nas using ID-TIMS 206Pb\/238U dates generated using a single isotopic tracer solution, 759 \ncertain components can be ignored (in this case tracer calibration uncertainty and 238U 760 \ndecay constant uncertainty).  This can be useful when attempting to determine 761 \nsediment accumulation rates or assess the synchroneity of events. 762 \nAlthough there is a desire for a date with the lowest possible uncertainty, the high-763 \nprecision is most beneficial when considered in the context of the single analyses.  It 764 \nis the precision of the single analyses that controls our ability to assess the occurrence 765 \nof \u2018open-system\u2019 behaviour and thus the accuracy of the final date.
