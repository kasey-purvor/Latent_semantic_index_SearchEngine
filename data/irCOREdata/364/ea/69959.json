JAMESON\nDepartment of Mathematics and Statistics, Lancaster University, Lancaster LAI iYF\n(Received 7 August 1995)\nIntroduction\nThe properties p-convexity and g-concavity are fundamental in the study of\nBanach sequence spaces (see [L-TzII]), and in recent years have been shown to be\nof great significance in the theory of the corresponding Schatten ideals ([G-TJ], [LP-\nP] and many other papers). In particular, the notions 2-convex and 2-concave are\nmeaningful in Schatten ideals. It seems to have been noted only recently [LP-P] that\na Schatten ideal has either of these properties if the underlying sequence space has.\nOne way of establishing this is to use the fact that if (E, || ||B) is 2-convex, then there\nis another Banach sequence space (F, \\\\ \\\\F) such that ||a;||| = ||a;2||F for all xeE. The\n2-concave case can then be deduced using duality, though this raises some\ndifficulties, for example when E is inseparable.\nIn this note, we present an alternative approach which proceeds directly from the\nMarkus-Mityagin lemma in the spirit of [GK] and [Si], by way of a quadratic\nvariant of the well-known Ky Fan Lemma. As well as being (arguably) a natural\nroute to the result just stated, this approach also delivers a theorem characterizing\nthe norm of an operator A as the supremum (in the 2-convex case) or the infimum\n(in the 2-concave case) of the norms (in E) of the sequences (||^4eJ) for orthonormal\nbases (e )^.\nNotation and definitions\nWe denote by x( j) the j th term of a numerical sequence x, and by et the j th unit\nvector. For sequences x, y, the product xy and the modulus \\x\\ are defined pointwise\nin the obvious way. We write Pn for the operator (on any sequence space) that\nreplaces all terms after the first n by 0, so that Pn(x) = Ijf=1x(j)e}. By a symmetric\nBanach sequence space we mean a Banach lattice (E, \\\\ \\\\\n E) of real null sequences with\na symmetric norm satisfying further:\n(i) e^eE and | | e j \u00a3 = 1 for all j ,\n(ii) IMI* = l im^r o \\\\Pn(x)\\\\E for all xeE.\n(We do not exclude the case where E is finite-dimensional.)\nLet (H, || ||) be a separable Hilbert space (of finite or infinite dimension). For a\ncompact operator A on H, let Sj(A)(j = 1,2,...) be the singular numbers of A. We\ndenote by SE(H) the Schatten ideal corresponding to the Banach sequence space E,\nwith norm o~E defined by o-E(A) = \\\\(s}(A))\\\\E.\nLet A1 An be self-adjoint elements ofSE{H), and let Ao = (Lf^Aj)1'2. Then Ao\neSE(H) (this is most easily seen by considering the operator on \/ \/ \" with first column\n698 G. J . O. JAMESON\nAY,... ,An, cf. [LP-P]). Hence one can define (as for sequences spaces) SE(H) to be 2-\nconvex if for all such Ax,..., An, we have for some M\n1\/2\ntf-1\nand 2-concave if we have\n\\l\/2(i * (A ).Y\nThe least such constant M is, respectively, the 2-convexity or 2-concavity constant\nof SE(H). We say that E, or SE(H), is strictly 2-convex or 2-concave if the constant\nis 1. Note that in the above definition it is clearly sufficient to consider positive\noperators Ay\nThe results\nWe will use the two following well-known theorems.\nPROPOSITION 1. Let A be compact, and let (et), (ft) be any two orthonormal sets. Then\nfor each n,\n(i) \u00a3l<^,\/i>l<S\u00ab^),\n(ii) Simil'^S^)2-\nStatement (i) is essentially [GK, II-4-1]; it also follows in elegant style from [Si,\npropositions I ' l l and 1-12], although it is not stated explicitly there. Statement (ii)\nfollows by applying (i) to A*A.\nFor the next result, we denote by Dn the dyadic group { \u2014 1,1}\". Elements of\nDn belong to Un, so act on Un by multiplication. Also, if neSn, the group\nof permutations of {1,2,.. . , n) and xe Un, then xn is the element of U\" defined by\n*n(j) = ^IXJ)]-\nPROPOSITION 2. Let x,y be decreasing, non-negative members of R\". Define X(k) =\n\"5->f-ixU)> ana\" Y(k) similarly. Suppose that X(k) < Y(k) for each k. Then\ny \u20ac conv {exn: e e Dn, n e Sn}.\nIf, further, X(n) = Y(n), then\nyeconv{xn:neSn}.\nProof. The first statement is the standard Markus-Mityagin lemma (see, for\nexample, [GK, 111-3]). The second statement is surely well known: it is stated\nwithout proof in [Sch, lemma 4-2], where it is observed that something like it already\nappears in [HLP]. For completeness, we mention how the proof of [GK] can be\nadapted for this case. Suppose the statement is false. Then there is a linear functional\n<f> such that <j)(y) > <j)(xn) for all neSn. Let <f>(u) = SjLiffl^O')- Since X(n) = Y(n), we\ncan add a constant c to each ajt and hence we may assume that ai ^  0 for each j . The\nproof now proceeds as before, but without the need for terms e}e{\u2014 1,1} to convert\nnegative a^'s to \\a^\\.\nSchatten ideals 699\nWe deduce a quadratic variant of the Ky Fan lemma.\nPROPOSITION 3. Let E beaBanach sequence space. Let x, y be decreasing, non-negative\nnull sequences such that 2*_!2\/0)2 < 2*=1 x(j)2 for all k.

It is clearly enough to prove both statements for finitely non-zero sequences\nx, y: the statement is then obtained by considering limits (with a small adjustment\nto the nth term to ensure the required equality in case (ii)).\n(i) By the first statement in Proposition 2, there exist rearrangements zr of x (for\n1 ^ r < -R, say), Ar > 0 and ereDn such that 2f=1 Ar = 1 and y2 = Sf_x Xrerz2T, hence\ny2 < Sf_xAr2r- By 2-convexity and the fact that ||zr||\u00a3 = \\x\\E for each r, we have\n2 J ^r \\\\ZT\\\\E\nr-1\n(ii) By the second statement in Proposition 2, there exist zr and Ar > 0 such that\n2f_jAr = 1 and y2 = H^_1Arz2. 2-concavity gives the stated inequality.\nLEMMA 1. If the Banach sequence space E is strictly 2-concave, then E is contained in\nl2 and \\\\x\\\\2 ^ ||*||\u00a3 for all xeE.\nProof. Take xeE.

Then (Pnx)2 = SjLi^O')2^ = Y^_xx2, so by 2-concavity,\nj\n i E n \\\nj-\\ 1-1\nThe statement follows.\nIn the same way, if E is 2-convex, then E contains l2 and \\\\x\\\\E < \\\\x\\\\2.\nIt is now easy to characterize the Schatten ideal norm of an operator in the way\nstated in the introduction. The following result is well known for the classical ideals\nSp(H) given by E = lp (see, for example, [GK], p. 95).\nTHEOREM 1. Let A be an element of SE(H).\n(i) If E is strictly 2-convex, then for any orthonormal set (e^),\n(ii) If E is strictly 2-concave, then for any orthonormal basis (e}),\nwhenever the right-hand side is finite.\nIn both cases, equality occurs for the (et) appearing in the spectral representation of A.\nProof. We maj' assume that (e^ ) is ordered so that (||vlej) is decreasing. Statement\n(i) follows at once from Proposition 1 (ii) and Proposition 3(i). If E is 2-concave, then\n700 G. J. O. JAMESON\nby Lemma 1, E^l2, so AeS2(B) (the Hilbert^Schmidt operators) and for any\northonormal basis (e;),\nProposition 3(ii) now gives statement (ii).\nWe remark that elementary examples (e.g. with E = lx) show that the right-hand\nside in statement (ii) is not always finite.\nA further application of 2-convexity or 2-concavity now yields the result stated at\nthe beginning.\nTHEOREM 2. If E is strictly 2-convex or 2-concave, then so is SE(H).\nProof. Let A\u00b1,... ,An be positive elements of SE(H), and let A = (IJ^A2)112. Let\nthe spectral representation of A be H^fij e} \u00ae ep so that \/i} = s}{A) and Ae} = fi} e},\nhence\n\/if = <A%,ejy = S (A\\epe^ = i \\\\Ate}\\\\2.\nDefine scalar sequences a, at by:\nat(j) =\nThen a2 = S\"_iaf and ||a||\u00a3 = (TE(A).\nIf E is 2-convex, then | |a | | | < 2\"_x \\\\af\\\\\\ and Theorem 1 (i) gives \\\\at\\\\E\nhence\nas required. If E is 2-concave, the same applies with both inequalities reversed.\n2-convexity and 2-concavity constants. There are plenty of examples of Banach\nsequence spaces that are 2-convex or 2-concave, but not with constant 1, for\nexample: (i) finite-dimensional spaces in general, (ii) certain Lorentz sequence spaces\n(see [R], [J]). If E has 2-convexity or 2-concavity constant J f (+ 1), then clearly\nProposition 3 and Theorem 1 hold with the constantM inserted. Owing to the second\nuse of 2-convexity or 2-concavity in Theorem 2, the above method requires the\ninsertion of M2 in this Theorem. Actually, SE{H) has the same 2-convexity or 2-\nconcavity constant as E. To show this, we amend the method as follows. With\na(j) = Sj(A) as above, Proposition 1 gives\nt)*S \u00ab(i)2 = S S l l^l i 2 ^ S s\n Sj(At\nWrite bt(j) = Sj(A(). The stated result is now given by the following variant of\nProposition 3:\nPROPOSITION 4. Let E be a Banach sequence space. Let a,b1,... ,bn be decreasing\nnon-negative sequences belonging to E, and let b2 = S f . j b\\. Suppose that 2J*LJ a(j)2 <\nI,*=1b(j)2 for all k.

Again it is enough to consider the finite-dimensional case. As in Proposition\n3, there exist Ar > 0 (for r = 1,... ,R) and nreSn such that Xf^A,. = 1 and\nr-1 r-1 i - 1\nwith the ^  replaced by equality in case (ii). Both statements now follow.\nREFERENCES\n[G-TJ] D. J. H. GAKLING and N. TOMCZAK-JAEGERMANN. The cotype and uniform convexity of\nunitary ideals. Israel J. Math. 45 (1983), 175-197.\n[GK] I. C.
