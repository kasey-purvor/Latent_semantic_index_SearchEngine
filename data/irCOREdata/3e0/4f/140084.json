There is considerable evidence that secondary explosive materials having a relatively large \n(10-12%) proportion of HTPB binder do not exhibit DDT under cook-off.  However, the understanding \nof the mechanisms controlling the growth of reaction in such experiments is incomplete.

We present experiments in which impacts were made against a RDX\/HTPB PBX using a \nsingle-stage light gas gun.  Electromagnetic particle velocity gauges were embedded within the targets \nat different distances from the impact face to record the onset of reaction, and in some cases \ndetonation.  These experiments were also performed against RDX\/TNT targets.  The time-resolved \nparticle velocity histories have allowed comparison of some of the factors governing growth of \nreaction, and have provided run-to-detonation distance data for different impact stresses.  \nKeywords: Ignition and growth, PBX, particle velocity gauge, shock initiation.\nPACS: 07.07.Df, 06.06-Ei, 47.40-Nm, 82.40-Fp.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe particle velocity technique using \nembedded gauges has been extensively used over \nthe past decades to explore the initiation and \nsubsequent growth of reaction in energetic \nmaterials.  In this technique conductors, embedded \nin a material that is subjected to shock loading, will \nacquire the local particle velocity.  This can be \nmeasured by arranging a steady magnetic field so \nthat a current is induced in the moving conductors.  \nEarly work [1-3] focused on the measurement of \nsteady detonations, while more recently [4-7] \ninterest has shifted to the initiation of explosives by \ngas-gun driven flyers.  More recent work [9,10] has \ndeveloped this technique using the 50mm single-\nstage gas gun at Shrivenham [8], and has included \nsome characterization of the type of RDX\/HTPB \nPBX that is currently of interest in the UK.\nIn this work we have refined our technique\nfurther in terms of target preparation and \ngeneration of the magnetic field, we have made \nimprovements to measurement accuracy, and we \nhave eased the experimental load in carrying out \nthis type of experiment.   Firings have been made \nin which RDX\/TNT and RDX\/HTPB charges were \ninitiated, and the run-to-detonation distances have \nbeen measured.  There appears to be superficially \ngood agreement between our data and that for \nComposition B-3, but there remain unexplained \ndetails in the particle velocity histories we have \nrecorded that demand further study. \nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE \nThe particle velocity gauges were of the \nVorthman type [4], and followed the design \ndescribed in [9], having seven Lagrangian elements \nvarying in width from 13mm to 7mm, and a single \n\u2018shock tracker\u2019.  The gauge arrays were etched \nfrom a flexible laminate of copper and polyimide, \n87\u0001m thick.  The variation in length of the \nLagrangian elements was no more than 0.3%.\nThe gauges were encapsulated with two sheets \nof Mylar, bonded to the gauge using a low-\nviscosity epoxy adhesive to avoid premature loss of \nsignals by the ionization from the incipient \ndetonation.  In early experiments, the encapsulating \nmaterial was 50\u0001m thick, yielding a gauge package \nthickness measured to be 185\u0001m.  In later \nexperiments the encapsulating material was 25\u0001m \nthick, yielding a gauge package thickness of \n140\u0001m.\nThe targets were all manufactured in two \nseparate slabs, with one face angled to allow the \ngauge to be cemented between them at an angle to \nthe impact face.  The angled arrangement meant \nthat an unobstructed portion of the target was \npresented to each gauge element along the impact \naxis.  For these experiments the gauge angle was \nchosen to be 60\u00ba to give a large depth over which \nthe target was instrumented.\nThe RDX\/TNT target components were cast \nfrom a single batch into a preheated mould that \naccurately defined the impact face and gauge \nmounting faces.  The sample densities were \nmeasured using the Archimedes method, the \nRDX\/TNT targets being 1.66\u00b10.02g\/cc. and the \nPBX 1.58\u00b10.06g\/cc.  The PBX targets were cut \nfrom a single block, and lapped by hand to final \ndimensions.  Additional characterization data are \nfound in [11].  The angle of the gauge plane was \nmeasured with a vernier gauge to be 60\u00b10.25\u00ba for \nall parts.\nThe gauges were assembled onto one half of \nthe target using an alignment jig and microscope, \nto an angular tolerance of \u00b12mrad with respect to \nthe impact face.  A low viscosity epoxy adhesive \nwas used to join the two target components \ntogether.  Each target was covered by a 1mm thick \nPMMA plate to aid mounting into the gun.  The \nmounting alignment for this gun is typically \n1.25mrad.\nThe magnetic field was generated using a pair \nof electromagnets, energized at the moment of the \nexperiment by switching a high-current power \nsupply.  In early experiments, two coils in the \nclassical air-spaced Helmholtz arrangement were \nused, as described in [9].  While the results were \ngood, several practical drawbacks were found: (a) \nthe coils were destroyed on every experiment and \nnew ones had to be made each time; and (b) to \nobtain a useful flux density in the target zone, the \ncoils were driven with ~10kW power, leading to \nrapid Joule heating, and hence making calibration \nand testing of the coils difficult.\nThe later experiments were made using a pair of \ncoils embedded in a steel and aluminium housing.  \nThe electromagnet geometry was designed using a \ncommercial finite element code, in an iterative \nprocess that aimed to achieve high field strength \nand low supply power.  The final design generated \na field measured to be 110\u00b12.0mT in a zone \n20x20x20mm, centred on the axis of the gun.  This \nwas achieved using a 24V DC battery bank, \ndelivering 60A.  A thermocouple embedded in one \nof the coils measured a rate increase of temperature \nof 0.2\u00baCs-1, and a measured rate of decrease in field \nstrength of 0.1mTs-1.  A flux meter was used to \nmap the magnetic flux density, corroborated with \nmeasurement of the coil current using a clamp \nmeter. \nThe eight sensing elements in the gauge \npackage were connected by separate RG174 \ncoaxial cables to two 4-channel oscilloscopes of \n1Ghz bandwidth, sampling at 1.6ns per point.  The \ninterconnecting cables were chosen to be \nimpedance matched throughout.  At a particle \nvelocity of 1kms-1, the longest Lagrangian element, \n(13mm wide) would be expected to give a signal of \n~1.5V. \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nIt can be seen in Fig. 1 that the particle \nvelocity on successive gauge elements increases, \nindicating the onset of reaction in the specimen.\nThe gross form of the record is consistent with \nexpectation, but there are details that require \nfurther explanation.  In particular, the particle \nvelocity on each gauge overshoots after the initial \nrise, and this prevents analysis of the material flow \nimmediately behind the shock.  The rise times for \nthe initial particle velocity excursion are consistent \nwith an impact alignment of 2.5mrad.  In this \nexperiment, the run to detonation occurs close to \nthe last Lagrangian element at 13.2mm from the \nimpact face.\nFigure 1. A typical particle velocity history for the PBX \ntarget.  \u0001 = 5.1\u00b10.25GPa.  Gauge elements at 2.8, 4.5, \n6.3, 8.0, 9.7, 11.5, 13.2mm from the impact face.  \nDetonation occurs between the gauges at 11.5 and \n13.2mm.\nThe shock velocity can be obtained by linear \nfitting either to the shock tracker data (Fig. 2) or to \nthe arrival times at the Lagrangian elements.  The \nmeasured particle velocity, at the plateau after the \ninitial rise and overshoot, can then be used to plot \nthe unreacted Hugoniot for the specimen, in Us-Up\nspace as shown in Fig. 3.\nThe linear fits to the shock tracker arrival times \nwere used to obtain run distances to detonation for \neach experiment as noted in Fig. 2.  The known \nHugoniots [10,11] were used to obtain impact \nstress given the (linear) shock velocity prior to \nbreakout of detonation.  These yielded the plot \nshown in Fig. 4 for both compositions.  \nIt can be seen from the plot in Fig. 4 that the \nRDX\/TNT in this study has similar initiation \nproperties to Composition B-3, over the range of \nimpact stresses tested. The slight decrease in \nsensitivity compared with Composition B-3 is \nattributed to the use of HMX-free RDX in our \nmaterial.\nFigure 2. Shock tracker data for the shot shown in \nFigure 2.  The linear fits give Us = 4.03\u00b10.1mm \u00b5s-1, D =\n8.16\u00b10.15 mm \u00b5s-1.  The transition between the two \nlinear portions appears to be gradual.  The crossing point \nfor the linear fits suggests breakout of detonation at \n12.4mm.\nFigure 3. Hugoniot in Us-Up space for PBX (circles) and \nRDX\/TNT (triangles).  Literature data (open symbols) \nshown for comparison.  Up taken from the Lagrangian \nelement closest to the impact face; Us derived from the \nshock arrival X-T plots, e.g. Figure 3.\nThe PBX composition is less sensitive than \nRDX\/TNT, and a linear fit through the PBX data \non the Pop-plot has a shallower slope compared to \nRDX\/TNT.  Hence, for low-stress impacts the run \ndistance is longer.  Extrapolation of the trend for \nthe PBX upwards implies that at ~7GPa the run \ndistance to detonation for the PBX and for \nRDX\/TNT will be the same.  It should be noted, \nhowever, that there are presently few data points in \nthis study and confirmation of this trend must await \nfurther experiments.\nFigure 4. Pop-plot of impact pressure vs. run distance to \ndetonation for all experiments.  Literature data (Van \nThiel) for Comp B-3 are given for comparison.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe embedded electromagnetic gauge \ntechnique has been implemented with reasonable \nsuccess.  The gross features of the initiation of the \ntwo secondary explosives have been captured, and \nthere is good correspondence between literature \ndata and the data from this study in both Us-Up\nHugoniot measurement and \u2018Pop-plot\u2019 \nmeasurement.\n There are unexplained details in many of the \nexperimental records, which obscure important\nfeatures during the particle velocity history.  In \nparticular, the overshoots noted in Fig. 1 are \napparent to some extent on all records.  These are \nattributed to the shock impedance mismatch \nbetween the gauge package and the test specimen: \na detailed study, following Cau [12], is proposed to \nexamine these features in greater depth.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank Prof. Neil \nBourne, Miss Sally Gaulter, Dr William Proud and \nDr Ron Hollands for their valuable advice.\nREFERENCES\n1.
