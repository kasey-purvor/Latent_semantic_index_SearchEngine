A \ngrowing body of evidence suggests that the involvement of all the social actors is a key aspect \nin successful decision making.

Thus, this case study suggests that the analysis of \nnarratives is a useful tool to complement SMCE.  \n1. Introduction \nThe emergence of sustainability problems has posed several dilemmas on the capacities \nof current governments to take decisions that affect simultaneously society and the \nenvironment. Muticriteria methods\n1\n aim at addressing the uncertainties associated to \nsustainability problems, by considering simultaneously several alternative descriptions \nof the problems (Munda, 2004) and by putting special emphasis on including additional \ncriteria to the traditional economic ones. These methods facilitate the decision-making \nprocess representing the views of different actors, allowing the comparison between \nalternatives, and visualizing the trade-offs between conflicting criteria (Kiker et al., \n2005).  \nThere is a growing body of evidence suggesting that successful decisions about \nfloodplain management issues require the participation of all the social actors (Bana et \nal., 2004; De Bruijn, 2005; Fordham, 2000; Haque et al., 2002; Messner and Meyer \n2006; Pearce, 2003). Some multicriteria methods have been developed to accommodate \nparticipation of stakeholders during the assessment process (e.g. Stirling, 2006). \nParticipatory approaches to multicriteria decision-making combine the possibility of \nconsidering several alternatives simultaneously with an emphasis on the process \n                                                          \n1\n Water policy is one of the fields in which multicriteria methods have been used extensively. On their \npioneering work in the Netherlands, Nijkamp and Vos used MCA for the planning of water resources \ndevelopment (Nijkamp and Vos, 1977). Thereafter MCA has been applied in various flood management \ncases.  \n \n 2 \nthrough which decisions are achieved (e.g. Gamboa and Munda, 2007). Some \nMulticriteria Analysis (henceforth MCA) applications have also been used to reach \nconsensus among stakeholders (e.g. H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen et al., 2001; Mustajoki et al., 2004).  \nTraditional MCA methods alone prove insufficient when confronted with the dynamic \nnature of stakeholders perspectives, the structures of power that influence the decision \nmaking process and the variability between definitions - in our case on the flood \nmitigation problem. In order to overcome these limitations, MCA should be combined \nwith other social research methods to allow a better representation of stakeholders\u201f \nviews and perspectives. An attempt to integrate social research methods within MCA \nhas result in the development of Social Multicriteria Evaluation (henceforth SMCE) (De \nMarchi et al., 2000; Gamboa, 2006; Gamboa and Munda, 2007; Janssen and Munda, \n1999; Munda, 2004). In order to integrate social aspects in SMCE, different methods \nand techniques can be used, such as surveys, discourse based evaluation, narrative \nanalysis, and value integration methods (e.g. in the case of flood related issues: Gregory \nand Wellman, 2001; Morris-Oswald and Sinclair, 2005; Simonovic, 2005).  \nThis paper analyzes a recent case of controversy in flood mitigation in Malborghetto-\nValbruna (Northern Italy) and assesses different scenarios using SMCE and social \nactors\u201f narrative analysis. The simultaneous application of both methods in the case of \nMalborghetto-Valbruna gives some insights about their combination and the potential of \nqualitative research methods to further develop SMCE.  \n \n2. The Malborghetto-Valbruna case-study \nConflicts concerning safety and environmental issues are common in flood prone areas. \nAn interesting example is the 2003 flash flood in Malborghetto-Valbruna, Northern \nItaly. After the flood event, decisions about mitigation measures led to a debate between \nadvocates of hydraulic works and those proposing a management of floods based on \nresilience and traditional knowledge. \nMalborghetto- Valbruna is a municipality in the Region of Friuli Venezia Giulia \nsituated near Austria and Slovenia. It is located in Valcanale valley on the discharge \narea of the river Fella and the main streams Rio Malborghetto and Rio Uque. The entire \nmunicipality has a population of 1,026 inhabitants (Municipal Statistical Office Data, \n2004) divided in 4 different hamlets: Ugovizza, Valbruna, Malborghetto and Bagni di \nLusnizza.  \nUgovizza and Malborghetto suffered a severe flash flood on 29 August 2003 which \ncaused 2 casualties and extensive material damage. The flood was the result of the \ncombination of two extreme events: an extraordinary storm, which discharged 400 mm \nof rainfall in a short period of three to six hours and the anomalous moisture condition \nof the soil, extremely dry at the end of a prolonged drought. Water transported \nsediments, stones, and shrubbery onto Malborghetto and Ugovizza, causing severe \ndamage to infrastructures and property and forcing the evacuation of 600 people. The \ndamage to the whole valley was estimated in 435 million Euros. \nThe recovery phase raised issues related to flood mitigation, such as decisions upon the \nconstruction of protection works in the floodplain and their maintenance, streams\u201f and \nrivers\u201f monitoring and control, floodplain zoning and regulation, and restoration of the \nriverine ecosystems. Arising conflicts included also disagreements among local people \nabout the reconstruction process and the distribution of compensation payments.  \n  3 \nOne of the most discussed issue regarded the decisions about protection measures, and \nin particular the construction of structural devices in the most dangerous streams \ninitiated by the regional Civil Protection\n2\n. While several projects started immediately \nafter the flood, others were delayed due to different reasons, such as expectation of \nfunds or of a favourable geological advice, as required by flood regulations.  \nThe construction of protection works encountered opposition from residents claiming \nthat local authorities had not consulted the relevant interest-groups during the decision \nmaking process. They contested the decisions about the localisation and the quantity of \nprotection works based on equity claims about hydrogeological risk distribution among \nresidents.  \nA group of residents concerned with the security of their properties established a Local \nCommittee for Safety. They demanded the construction of new hydraulic works \nupstream to ensure the total protection of their properties; lately the regional Civil \nProtection joined the Local Committee for Safety in their claims to municipal \nauthorities. In contrast, the local political opposition party criticized the top-down \ntechnocratic procedures of the Municipality and the Civil Protection because they had \nfailed to involve the community in the flood management process. The opposition \ncoalition claimed that local knowledge would offer better alternatives for the flood risk \nmitigation such as the implementation of minor hydraulic works, the restoration of the \nvegetation cover and the enforcement of an adequate emergency plan. The institutional \nanalysis presented in Table 1 identifies the social actors involved and describes their \nmain positions.  \n  \n                                                          \n2\n In Italy, the Department of Civil Protection (under the Presidency of the Council of Ministers) \ncoordinates the Government\u201fs actions relative to forecasting, early warning, support, and rescue. Regions, \nProvinces and Municipalities prepare programmes for risk forecasting and prevention. At the local level, \ncontingency plans and emergency response are co-ordinated by the Prefect, and implemented by the local \nFire Brigades (which depend on the Ministry of the Interior), together with the local Civil Protection \nservices (of the Region, Province, Municipality) (De Marchi et. al., 2006).  \n \n 4 \nTable 1. Social actors involved in the Malborghetto-Valbruna case study (2006) \nSocial actor Main features \n1. Regional Civil \nProtection  \nThe Civil Protection is a civil service organization at the regional scale. Its \nmain functions are guaranteeing the security of the population and coordinate \nactions relative to forecasting, early warning, support, and rescue.  \n \n2. Geologists A group of geologists living and working in the area proposed the relocation \nalternative. Their perspective is an \"expert\" one, differentiated from \nengineers. In their opinion, the only solution to guarantee real safety is the \nrelocation of some parts of the hamlet of Ugovizza. \n \n3. Municipality of \nMalborghetto-\nValbruna \n(Majority \ncoalition) \nActions taken by the majority coalition identify the council as a technocratic \norganization. The Local Council is likely to hold moderate positions with \nrespect to the construction of new hydraulic works although in practice it \nsupports the proposals of the Civil Protection. \n \n4. Municipal \nopposition \ncoalition  \nThe municipal opposition coalition is active at a policy level and presents \nproposals that move away from the technocratic orientations of the Council. \nThey argue that local people should be widely represented in the decision-\nmaking process for flood mitigation, both in the evaluation process and in the \ndevelopment of innovative solutions. In their view, local knowledge can \nprovide alternative solutions for flood mitigation such as smaller adaptive \nhydraulic works, natural regeneration and different land use management \ntechniques. \n \n5. Local residents \nliving in high risk \nareas  \n(Ugovizza hamlet) \nLocal residents living in Ugovizza were heavily damaged by the 2003 flood \nevent. Their geographical location makes them the most exposed sector of the \ncommunity to flood events. \n \n6. Local residents \nliving in medium \nrisk areas \n(Malborghetto \nhamlet) \nLocal residents in Malborghetto-Valbruna suffered material damages during \nthe 2003 flood event. The construction of new protection works has increased \ntheir concerns. In addition, they complain about the visual impacts of the new \nworks.  \n \n7. Local Committee \nfor Safety  \nThe Local Committee for Safety is a local grassroot organization, created in \nresponse to the prevention and mitigation measures planned after the flood. \nTheir members demand the construction of further hydraulic works upstream.  \nMembers of the committee are mainly \u201cnew residents\u201d, i.e. people who \nmoved to the village in recent years. More precisely, they moved to an area \nof the village urbanized in the seventies and considered by local people one \nof the most dangerous one within the municipality. Around 100 people have \nsigned the original statute of the committee. \n \n8. Local voluntary \nfire brigades \nLocal voluntary fire brigades have a strong tradition in Northern Italy. \nMembers of the brigades are local volunteers who, after training, make \nthemselves available when an emergency occurs. Around 100 local residents \nare involved in three different local voluntary fire brigades corps located in \nMalborghetto, Ugovizza  and Valbruna. \n \n9. Environmentalists \n(only at a regional \nlevel) \nThey are present mainly at a regional level and their direct influence in the \nlocal community is limited, although it is relevant for the safety debate. Their \nproposals include the re-naturalization of the area and the return of the \nriver\/streams to their original beds. Given recent events these proposals are \nsupported by very few residents. \n \n \n \n  5 \n3. Methodology \nThe analysis presented in this paper utilises data collected in the task 11 \"Risk \nperception, community behaviour and social resilience\" of the FLOODsite research \nproject. The research design combined several methods and techniques (De Marchi et. \nal., 2006): firstly, data from secondary sources\n3\n on the socio-demographic situation in \nthe area; secondly, qualitative information was gathered through eighteen semi-\nstructured interviews with qualified informers\n4\n; thirdly, statistical data was obtained \nthrough a survey with a standardized questionnaire\n5\n. This process was intended as a \nbasic sequence of steps, each one providing an input to the following one. The second \nand third steps are the most relevant for the purpose of this paper. The interviews were \nplanned to explore, among others, the main strengths and weaknesses of a community \nexposed to flood risk, and to collect information about the emergency management, the \nreconstruction planning, the decisions about protection measures, the existing flood \nmitigation scenarios, etc. In the survey, 100 residents were interviewed about their flood \nexperience, opinions and attitudes including the most urgent measures to adopt in the \nfloodplain, the role of structural and non structural protection measures, and the \ninfluence of different actors in the decision making process. \nThe findings of the interviews and the survey have been used as the starting point for \nthis paper, and more precisely for the Social Multi-Criteria Evaluation (SMCE) and the \nsocial actors\u201f narratives analysis. The first method allows the comparison of different \nscenarios or management alternatives with respect to different criteria. The second one \nhelps exploring value dilemmas and interest conflicts with regard to flood mitigation \ndecisions in Malborghetto-Valbruna. \n4. Results from the Social Multicriteria Evaluation \n4.1. Development of scenarios \nThe application of SMCE to a case study requires specifying scenarios and criteria. The  \ndevelopment of scenarios is followed by the selection of relevant criteria and finally \ndifferent methods are used to compare the scenarios. Scenarios and criteria can be \ndefined directly by the experts involved in the study or by involving the local actors in \ndeveloping the SMCE.  \n                                                          \n3\n Socio-demographic information about gender, age, level of education, occupation rate, etc. were gathered \nwith the support of the statistical municipal office. \n4\n  Qualified informers are people who, due to their status, role or experience, have a deep knowledge of the \nsubject under investigation and\/or the relevant social context. The eighteen semi-structured interviews \nwere conducted with the mayor, some city councillors, the head of technical and environmental \ndepartment involved in area planning, the head and some members of the local fire brigades corps, \nchairmen of some local cultural associations, the chairman and a member of the local committee for \nSafety, journalists of local newspapers, and community leaders. \n5\n The questionnaire was prepared for the FLOODsite project (Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. and \nwas submitted face to face by trained interviewers.  It included 72 questions, mostly pre-structured, with \nsome open questions, and covering numerous issues: community cohesion and social capital; flood risk \nawareness; residents\u201f behaviours during 2003 event; opinions about damage compensations and risk \ninsurance; level of personal and community preparedness before and after the event; attitudes toward \nmitigation, regulation, and constraints; personal knowledge and information about safety connected to \ndifferent elements (protection works, warning systems,\u2026); lessons learnt from the event; general \ninformation. A quota sample was selected on the basis of the following variables: gender, age, education, \nand risk exposure (high, medium and low risk area).  \n 6 \nDifferent scenarios basically reflect different approaches to flood management and \nmitigation. For example, Green and colleagues (2000) identify four alternative \napproaches: those based in local knowledge, structural approaches, non-structural \napproaches, and holistic approaches.  \nApproaches based on local knowledge assume that communities living in flood prone \nareas have developed specific knowledge that allows them to develop adaptive \nstrategies to cope with flood disasters (e.g. Rasid and Bimal, 1987).  \nStructural approaches are characterized by the construction of big hydraulic structures \nto \u201ccontrol\u201d floods. Symbolically, these structures are referred to as \u201cdefences\u201d (e.g. \nWCD, 2000).  \nNon-structural approaches emerged within integrated strategies for the management of \nfloodplains, in combination with technocratic approaches. Later on, advocates of non-\nstructural approaches have focused on resettlement and adaptations of existing \ninfrastructures, arguing that human development in floodplains should be strictly \nlimited.  \nHolistic approaches integrate all the other approaches within the idea of \u201cliving with the \nflood hazard\u201d. The aim is to reduce or mitigate the risks as much as possible, by means \nof socio-economically viable measures. This approach emphasizes the development of \nwarning systems and evacuation plans, as well as increasing resilience of the \ncommunity by creating appropriate institutions to deal with flood management and \nmitigation. \n \nOn the basis of these approaches, a literature review (Bana et al., 2004; De Bruijn, \n2005; Fordham, 2000; Green et al., 2000; Haque, 2002; Kiker et al., 2005; Messner and \nMeyer, 2006; Schanze, 2006) and the information gathered during the fieldwork, four \nscenarios were identified in Malborghetto-Valbruna: \n\uf0a7 Preservation of the current situation. This alternative assumes that no further \naction is to be taken for the flood mitigation, other than completing the \nconstruction of already planned protection infrastructures.  \n\uf0a7 Higher safety through the construction of new protection works. Promoted by the \nLocal Committee for Safety, this scenario involves the construction of \u201cbigger \ndefence structures\u201d, which in their opinion would ensure a higher safety level.  \n\uf0a7 Relocation of part of the community. This would result is the relocation of people \ncurrently living in the highest risk areas.

Impact matrix \nFollowing the selection of relevant criteria on the basis of the fieldwork, the authors \nranked the scenarios for every indicator on a qualitative scale of seven ordinal \ncategories, 7 being the most favourable result and 1 meaning the worst expected result, \naccording to the directions derived from needs and expectations. This input was used to \nbuild the Impact Matrix shown in Table 3. \nTable 3.

This software allows for \nthe aggregation of the results for each criterion using pairwise comparisons\n7\n. Pairs of \nscenarios were compared calculating preference relations (much better, better, \napproximately equal, equal, worse, much worse) using no weighting. The final ranking \nof the scenarios, in Figure 1, shows the aggregate results for all the indicators.  The final \nranking results from the intersection of two separate rankings, \u03a6+ indicating how much \nbetter that scenario is than the others (aggregating the best results for each indicator), \nwhile \u03a6- explains how much worse that scenario is than the other options (aggregating \nthe worse results for each indicator).  \nFigure 1.

For instance, scenario C (Relocation of part of \nthe community) and F (Renaturalisation of the river course) are ranked at the bottom \neven if both of them have the most beneficial environmental impacts. In this case all the \ncriteria were considered to have the same importance. Had we established a weighting \nto prioritise the preservation of the environment, scenarios C and F could have ranked \nmuch higher.  \n4.3. Social Impact Matrix \nData gathered during fieldwork provided the basis for the identification of different \nactors, their perspectives and preferences with respect to each scenario. These inputs \nhave been used to build the Social Impact Impact Matrix shown in Table 4. The \npreferences of each actor were ranked from 1 (the least support) to 7 (the maximum \nsupport) for each scenario. The Social Impact Matrix differs from the Impact Matrix in \nthat it shows the opinions of the actors about each scenario, instead of using criteria as a \nproxy for evaluation.  \n                                                          \n6\n NAIADE (Novel Approach to Imprecise Assessment and Decision Environments) (Munda, 1995) is a \nmulticriteria method for the comparison of alternatives on the basis of a set of criteria. \n \n 10 \nTable 4.

In order to do this, NAIADE calculates \nsemantic distances\n8\n between each pair of interest groups, which is a measure of \nsimilarity (i.e. the more agreements about the ranking of different scenarios, the less \nsemantic distance between these two interest groups). The Dendrogram for the case in \nMalborghetto-Valbruna is shown in Figure 2. \n                                                          \n8\n The semantic distance between i and j (two different stakeholders) is calculated as the Minowsky distance \nbetween the two elements.  \n  11 \nFigure 2.

This last \ncluster is divided in two sub-clusters: one formed by the local people (whether in high \nor medium risk areas) and another by their non-technocratic representatives (fire \nbrigades and political opposition groups). \n  \n 12 \n5. Social Actors\u2019 Narratives and value dilemmas in flood mitigation  \nValues\n9\n are shown to influence or determine several key aspects in research related to \nflood mitigation decision-making processes and outcomes (e.g. Morris-Oswald and \nSinclair, 2005). Values related to safety, urban and economic development, environment \nare usually identified as key by social actors while confronting flood risk issues. Values  \nare very often conflicting: for example, in the case of floodplain zoning and related \nurban constraints, individuals may need to evaluate the relative importance of personal \nfreedom and private property rights on the one hand, and public safety on the other \n(Beatley, 1989; 1999). The following analysis of social actors\u201f narratives focuses on \nvalue dilemmas and on those aspects that have not found an appropriate representation \nin the SMCE.  \n5.1. The safe development paradox  \nIn Malborghetto-Valbruna the safety issue is one of the most deeply felt conflicts after \nthe 2003 flood event, when geologists suggested the relocation of some dwellings, \nwithout finding an agreement with engineers and local administrators.  The mayor and \nthe members of the majority political party together with the Civil Protection engineers \nproposed the construction of new protection works, whereas the Safety Committee \nmembers demanded for more safety through the construction of other protection works \nand the maintenance of the existing ones. Their main argument can be summarised in \nthe quote of a Committee members\u201finterview: \u201cthe more the protection works, the safer \nwe are\u201d.  \nThe same need was expressed by the municipal opposition coalition, but using different \narguments: they suggested that local and traditional knowledge could contribute to \nbetter decisions about safety, including a better understanding of the environment and \nits history. Similar perspectives were expressed by the voluntary fire brigades, \npreoccupied about the impact of new protection works in the river basin in the case of \nan emergency. They argued that in case of an extreme event, the works would \nparadoxically constitute a greater source of danger in case of failure. This contrasts with \nthe results of the questionnaire survey which show that although protection works do \nnot increase individual perceptions of safety, they are regarded as tangible symbols of \nprotection for the community\n10\n (see also Morris-Oswald and Sinclair, 2005).  \nThree core issues emerge from this debate:  \n\uf06e Safety dilemmas: between the two alternatives (relocation vs. new protection \nworks), an old question in risk research becomes relevant: \u201eHow safe is safe \nenough?\u201f (Fischhoff et al., 1978). This should be considered also with reference \nto \u201esafety distribution\u201f: some areas have been made safer than others thanks to \n                                                          \n9\n The term \u201cvalue\u201d has myriad definitions, including both the idea of value as a material expression of \nworth and values as moral, ethical, social and spiritual belief systems that influence behaviour (Satterfield \net al., 2000). In this paper values are intended as a category of \u201cbeliefs\u201d, more specifically \u201cevaluative \nbeliefs\u201d which are used to judge whether an action, an objective or an alternative is good or bad compared \nto others (Rokeach, 1973). A consisting body of literature explains the role of value systems on the \ndevelopment of actors\u201f perspectives toward a social problem. There is a relationship between values and \nhow people collectively address problems, form expectations and interpret facts and events (e.g.  Beatley, \n1999; Chong, 2000; Gregory, 2002; Guerrier et al., 1995; Norton and Steinmann, 2001).  \n10\n More than a half of respondents (52%) agree (4 or 5 on a five point Likert scale) with the statement \n\u201cprotection works provide a feeling of security to residents\u201d. \n  13 \nthe construction of protection works, which was due to the Local Safety \nCommittee lobbying action. \n\uf06e Safe development paradox\n11\n and protection works\u2019 failure: some actors fear the \nfailure of protection works, because it could multiply damage in the case of \nextreme flood events. They insist on the importance of residual flood risk (that \nremains despite the adoption of flood prevention and control policies) and \nemphasize the need to inform residents about it. \n\uf06e Civic involvement: the lack of information to residents (e.g. before the \nimplementation of new plans about protection works) and the lack of community \ninvolvement in decision making are deemed negative by the majority of actors. \nSome criticize the use of a technocratic top-down approach, which reduced the \npossibilities for citizen participation. \n5.2. Floodplain zoning and limit to urban\/economic development \nFloodplain zoning and regulations have an impact upon urban development and \neconomic growth. Displaying risk levels through floodplain zoning is subject to \nuncertainties concerning hydrogeological factors and is also related to the consequences \nof adoption of  the risk maps (and relative urban constraints) for the community. Social \nactors with strong economic or urban development interests tend to ask for the reduction \nof constraints, while those responsible for the safety of the communities tend to avoid \nthe liabilities from extreme flood events. Contradictions between perceptions about \nconstraints and economic development plans abound in flood prone areas\n12\n, and this \nwas the case also in Malborghetto-Valbruna.  Here areas where building was not \nallowed in the past were put to use after the construction of new protection works: for \ninstance, urbanisation was allowed in some areas where there are records of landslides \nin the past. On the contrary, the new zoning prevent the development in areas where it \nwas allowed in the past. In practice, this resulted in newly built areas that are more \nvulnerable to extreme events and economic decline in the neighbourhoods where urban \ndevelopment was restricted.  \nMoreover, those who were relocated after the 2003 flood experienced an increase in \ntheir new properties\u201f value because they were located in areas designated as safer. As a \nresult of this equity problem, the political minority coalition expressed concerns about \nthe potential negative impacts of flood risk on attracting new investors and the need to \ncreate job and business opportunities for young people. The underlying assumption was \nthat the investment of resources in economic development goals is strictly connected to \nthe demographic community survival. \nThis argument was strongly criticized by regional environmentalist groups. They argued \nthat the decisions taken by the responsible authorities promoted the development of \nindividual industrial and commercial activities without an integrated vision of \nsustainable development for the whole valley. In this context,  local administrators and \ngeologists in charge of floodplain zoning were highly concerned with personal \n                                                          \n11The \u201csafe development paradox\u201d refers to the fact that protection works do not guarantee total safety for \nthe community and in the case of extreme events they might turn into sources of danger (Burby, 1998; \n2006; Enserink, 2004; Handmer, 2001). \n12\n Pidgeon (2005) for instance, shows that development plans in France include areas which are \nsimultaneously designed as high risk and fit for  new industrial installations. \n 14 \nresponsibility issues in risk levels\u201f display and with accusations of inequities in their \ndecisions about relocation.  \nIn summary, the main dilemmas in floodplain zoning are the following: \n\uf0a7 Perceived incongruence in floodplain zoning: The new floodplain zoning after the \nconstruction of protection works is perceived as incongruent by some residents and \ninvestors causing conflicts with local administrators and geologists in charge of risk \nlevels\u201f display.  \n\uf0a7 Floodplain zoning and economic growth: Discrepancies between decisions about \nconstraints and economic development can be found. On the one hand, decision-\nmakers are pressed by some residents and investors to reduce risk areas due to \neconomic and urban development interests. On the other hand they are also liable \nfor  community safety. The presence of different non-equivalent descriptions of \nreality and social incommensurability (Munda, 2004; 2005) results in different \ndefinitions of what are constraints to development and how decisions about \nconstraints should be taken.  \n\uf0a7 Equity in risk distribution: because the distribution of risk influences household \neconomies through the modification of house prices, the increase of risk levels in \nsome areas have created deprived groups of individuals living in an area defined as \nunsafe, while the value of their properties decreases. \n5.3. Rivers\u2019 renaturalisation and maintenance of the territory \nNatural resources management is another issue characterised by extremely different \nvalue orientations. In Malborghetto-Valbruna, environmentalists consider the \nrestoration of the old river bed and the research for more space for streams and rivers as \nthe main priorities for the floodplain management. In policy making, they argue, social \nconstraints can be modified, but natural constraints are given. This objective is not \neasily compatible with development priorities of the other actors. This is explicit in the \n(same) residents\u201f concerns about being relocated if the streams are renaturalized. They \ncriticize environmentalists saying that this extreme solution could also result in \ndisastrous consequences: for instance, the negative consequences of the 2003 flood  \nhave been exacerbated by the accumulation of debris along the river bed, a consequence \nof recent environmentalists\u201f conservation policies. Other local actors oppose \nconservation policies for similar reasons, citing the evidence from past territory \nmaintenance practices, which also facilitated its control and monitoring.  \nIn their proposal for re-naturalisation, environmentalists have met opposition from \ndifferent other actors. Although this issue seems to be \u201conly\u201d about the relocation of \nlocal inhabitants, the conflict has originated from the existence of different \nunderstandings and beliefs about what is nature, and what should be the relationship \nbetween nature and humankind.  \nIn this case there is one main dilemma: the existence of conflicting scenarios about \necosystem integrity. The decision to entirely preserve the river environment is \nconsidered as something far away from local styles and traditions of dealing with \nterritory maintainance. \n \n  15 \n6. Discussion  \nThe application of both SMCE and Narratives Analysis has contributed to understand \nthe Malborghetto-Valbruna case and it may provide some indications about how to \nbetter deal with flood mitigation conflicts.  \nThe Impact Matrix elaborated in SMCE has proven an useful tool for flood mitigation. \nAs we have seen, it may be used to elaborate a ranking of scenarios according to \ndifferent criteria. However, its main value is the elicitation of the advantages and \ndisadvantages of each scenario, accordingly to each indicator. This should be used not \nas a one-off tool, but rather as an iterative one, which could be improved also through  \nthe actors involvement, as in other cases of SMCE application (e.g. Gamboa, 2006; \nMunda, 2004). In the Malborghetto-Valbruna case, the Impact Matrix allows for the \ndepiction of the multiple languages of valuation that may be used to justify the \nmanagement of a floodplain. Because different criteria would ensure different \nrecommendations, the Impact Matrix explicitly shows the trade-offs between scenarios. \nAn interesting example is alternative C (\u201cRelocation of part of the community\u201d), which \nwould have very positive environmental results, and it would also resolve the conflict \nover flood mitigation altogether, by taking the people out fo the risk zone. However, as \nthe Impact Matrix shows, this option is difficult to realise, because it has unacceptable \nsocial and economic costs. NAIADE offers a ranking of alternatives, which may guide \nthe decision-making process. However, it is important to consider and use SMCE as a \nprocedural tool that guarantees the transparence of the process, rather than a \ntechnocratic tool providing one single best solution. \nThe Dendrogram of Coalitions complements the analysis done in the Impact Matrix. It \nis a representation tool that puts in evidence the potential power alliances between \ndifferent groups of actors and shows whether some scenarios are isolated owing to the \nlack of power of determined actors. In the Malborghetto-Valbruna case, the \nDendrogram shows three main groups: those who priviledge the construction of the \nhydraulic works, those who prioritise environmental criteria and those who defend the \ndevelopment of an integrated plan of control able to integrate all the scenarios. In this \ncase we see that the scenarios offered by the first two groups are those who generate the \ngreatest opposition and division within the community and that produce the isolation of \ntheir proponents.  \nAs we have seen above, SMCE is a useful tool for the management of floodplain \nconflicts. However, the analysis of narratives has shown that a single application of \nSMCE does not capture the richness of the floodplain conflict in Malborghetto-\nValbruna. For instance, the examination of social actors\u201f narratives shows that:  \n\uf0a7 Some relevant value dilemmas remain unsolved independently of the chosen \nscenario (i.e. maintainance of the status quo, new protection works, relocation,\u2026) \nsuch as how to deal with the safe development paradox or the trade-off between \nsafety and economic development.  \n\uf0a7 Approaches to flood risk mangement (i.e. structural, non-structural, holistic, local \nknowledge based approaches) are adopted depending on the values of individuals \nand their particular strategies in the struggles for power at the local level. In \npractice most actors favour a combination of styles rather than a single one.   \n\uf0a7 Decision makers\u201f attitudes on flood mitigation deeply influence the other social \nactors\u201f preferences toward scenarios and criteria. The selection of one single \nscenario can impose a valuation narrative (and its rhetoric). \n 16 \nThese observations suggest that scenarios should not be considered in isolation but in \ncombination. Therefore, if management styles appear to be mixed within the social \nactors\u201f narratives, then scenarios should be developed accordingly. Rather than defining \nseparate scenarios according to separate management approaches, scenarios that present \na balance between the different approaches would be more suitable in the Malborghetto-\nValbruna case. From this it can be inferred that the analysis of narratives is a useful tool \nto improve the individuation of values and interests at stake in the institutional analysis \nand to redefine scenarios during the iterative evaluation process that characterises \nSMCE.   \nNarrative Analysis also contributes to the process of generating evaluation criteria, \nselecting indicators and impact scores. Some relevant decisions must be taken by the \nanalysts during the process of criteria selection regarding the quantity and quality of \ncriteria. During the fieldwork, social actors were asked about their needs and \nexpectations and these suggested the relevant criteria for flood mitigation. However the \ndifferent actors\u201f criteria were too numerous and a selection process was necessary. In \nthe meantime, some needs and expectations can not find an appropriate space as criteria. \nConsequently, comparing the value and interest conflicts with the criteria shows that the \nselected criteria represent the views and priorities of some social actors better than \nothers\u201f. Moreover little research is carried out regarding the question how the \npreferences of social actors could be integrated properly in the multi-criteria evaluation. \nNot only the processes of criteria selection, but also the weighting highly influence the \noutcome of multi-criteria evaluation of risks. The question is also who exactly should \nparticipate in these processes and how: issues like legitimacy and equity arise from such \nquestions.. \nAnother issue to be considered in SMCE is the disagreements of the social actors about \nthe extent and nature of the economic, social, and environmental impacts of each \nalternative. In this paper impacts have been determined accordingly to the judgements \nof the authors, based on their previous experience, the understanding of the \nMalborghetto-Valbruna case, the interviews to the social actors. However, this is clearly \ninsufficient, as the analysis of narratives shows that there are discrepancies in the \njudgements about the nature of the impacts and their magnitude among the different \nactors. For instance, there may be disagreements about the magnitude of the visual \nimpacts of the works: while residents living in medium-risk areas complain about the \nhydraulic works\u201f visual impacts, citizens belonging to the Local Committee for Safety \nregard them as symbols of safety, which enable them to feel safe in their daily lives. \nMoreover stakeholders may also disagree about the relevance of the impacts.  \nHow can these differences be fully addressed without resorting to experts and \nadministrators, in an effort to include the local social actors in the SMCE process? \nSome scenarios are open, but need testing in practice. A possible solution could be the \nelaboration of  different impact matrixes according to the preferences of each actor and \ndevelop an algorithm which could enable us to balance the different scenarios. \nHowever, this alternative has several shortcomings which could be object of further \nresearch such as the development of the algorithm; the balance of impact matrix when \nactors select different criteria; or the compatibility and representativity of the results. \nImplementing this solution would add a considerable degree of complexity to the \nSMCE, taking the researchers away from their main objective of finding a decision-\nmaking procedure that compromises between simplicity and representativity. \nEstablishing a single impact matrix in SMCE implies the reduction of multiple \nperspectives and understandings down to a reduced list of simple and measurable \n  17 \ncriteria. Whereas this may be an unavoidable step in SMCE, researchers must be aware \nof this shortcoming and act accordingly when presenting the results to local \nstakeholders.  \nFinally the study of narratives has shown that the social actors may form unexpected \ncoalitions depending on a number of factors. An interesting example is that of the Local \nCommittee for Safety, which does not form a coalition with the Municipal Authorities \nbut rather with the Civil Protection Services. This seems to contradict the results of the \nDendrogram obtained in SMCE, in which the three social actors seem to be closely \nlinked. A crucial issue that separates the Local Committee for Safety and the Municipal \ninstitutions is the compensation benefits distributed after the flood event. This gives us \nan important insight about SMCE: the analysis of coalitions is based only on their \npositions with respect to one situation, in this case the future scenarios for flood \nmitigation. However, narratives analysis shows that, in practice, coalitions are \ndependent on several other factors which may not be directly linked to the problem \nstudied in the SMCE. While the method may not be suitable to analyse the complexity \nof the social structure in the area of study (i.e. social networks\u201f system, coping \nmechanisms and solidarity between different groups, social cohesion, etc.) it is \nimportant to recognise the possible alliances between actors and to acknowledge that \nthese alliances, as well as any of the interactions occurring within the community, may \nnot be directly linked to the problem under study.  \n7. Conclusion \nThe case of Malborghetto-Valbruna illustrates the existence of unresolved dilemmas \nand conflicts related to flood management and mitigation issues. These are represented, \namong others, by the problem of the safe development paradox and protection works\u201f \nfailure, the perceived incongruence in risk levels\u201f display, the trade-off between safety \nand economic growth, the equity issues in risk distribution. Fuelled by these dilemmas, \na fruitful debate has emerged in Malborghetto-Valbruna, sometimes transformed in an \nopen conflict around the main flood mitigation issues and options. SMCE can help to \nmediate between the actors and to envisage new flood mitigation policies.  \nThe case study suggests that the analysis of narratives is a useful tool to complement \nSMCE. This analysis enabled us to identify future routes for a better SMCE of the \nscenarios in Malborghetto-Valbruna, and it also unveiled some of the shortcomings of \nSMCE. This evaluation could be enhanced by:  \n\uf0a7 Improving the definition of scenarios according to both social actors\u201f perspectives \nand the main value dilemmas at stake, which are not always appropriately \nrepresented by the criteria used in SMCE;  \n\uf0a7 Acknowledging the limitations in the evaluation of the impacts. For instance, social \nactors might establish thresholds of \u201cnon-acceptable impacts\u201d;  \n\uf0a7 Unveiling the differences between social actors that a priori seem to share the same \nattitudes toward flood mitigation scenarios.  \nSMCE addresses one of the main problems confronted in Natural Resources \nManagement; the existence of different languages of valuation, that is, different \noutlooks on what this management should achieve and how. The strength of SMCE is \nits capacity to simultaneously represent these languages of valuation. However, it is \nimportant to reflect on the limitations that this social incommensurability poses for both \nSMCE and Narrative Analysis. The use of particular procedures such as matrixes, \nweights, vetoes and even surveys or workshops influence which languages of valuation \n 18 \nare more powerful in the decision making process. While SMCE opens the door for the \ninclusion of as many perspectives as possible, it is important to elicit all the assumptions \nused by the analyst(s) in an effort to avoid the decision-making process to be captured \nby a particular valuation language. \nA similar issue influences the construction of the Social Impact Matrix: most of the \nactors adopt a single language of valuation in confronting with different strategies for \naction. As a result, the Social Impact Matrix appears to reflect a community where \neverybody has a clear agenda and fixed objectives and where middle grounds are almost \nunattainable. In practice however, actors may hold different languages of valuation \nsimultaneously and their perspectives may be dynamic through time. For instance, local \nresidents stress the importance of preserving natural resources but also see economic \ngrowth as a priority. Their choices of a scenario(s) would be dependent on the particular \nconditions in which they make such a choice and, crucially, on how the scenarios are \npresented to them. The comparison of the narrative analysis and SMCE has also shown \nsome of the aspects of SMCE which could be enhanced through further research: in \nparticular the difficulties to address different interpretations of the relevance of criteria  \nand the importance of developing SMCE in the local context of decision making. \n  \n  19 \nReferences \nBana e Costa C A, Antao da Silva P, Nunes Correia F, 2004, \u201cMulticriteria evaluation \nof flood control measures: the case of Ribeira do Livramento\u201d Water Resources \nManagement 18 (3) 263\u2013283  \nBeatley T, 1989, \u201cTowards a moral philosophy of natural disaster mitigation\u201d \nInternational Journal of Mass Emergencies and Disasters 7 (1) 5\u201332 \nBeatley T, 1999 Ethical dilemmas in hazard mitigation (DIANE Publishing Co., Darby, \nPA) \nBurby R, 1998 Cooperating with Nature.
