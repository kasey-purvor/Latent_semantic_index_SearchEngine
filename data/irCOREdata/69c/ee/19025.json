Our data suggest that a paucity of F. prausnitzii in the gastrointestinal\nmicrobial communities is likely to be a minor aetiological factor in CD: recovery\nfollowing elemental diet is attributed to lower levels of gut flora.\nIntroduction\nThe cause of Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) is unknown and successful,\nlong-term treatment represents considerable clinical and phar-\nmacological challenges. The conventional treatment of disease\nof mild to medium severity consists of antibiotics to counteract\ninfection and 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) with or without\ncorticosteroids to counter inflammation, but remission can also\nbe achieved with enteral feeding (King et al., 1997). The faecal\nbacterial flora in CD is known to be abnormal (Sartor, 2008).\nCD has been suggested to be an autoimmune disease with an\nimmune attack directed against the resident bacteria of the\ncolon (Macpherson et al., 1996). The coating of colonic bacteria\nwith immunoglobulin approaches 100% in active CD, as\ncompared with 20% in healthy subjects and patients with\nirritable bowel syndrome (IBS). After enteral feeding, this\ncoating is rapidly reduced (van der Waiij et al., 2004).\nThere is increasing evidence that gut microorganisms play\nkey roles in gastrointestinal disease (Sartor, 2006; 2008).\nSome are believed to generate a harmful toxin (Pitcher &\nCummings, 1996; Loubinoux et al., 2002). Many others are\nknown to yield butyrate, which is not only an essential\nenergy source for colonocytes (Chapman et al., 1994;\nCostello et al., 1994; Macpherson et al., 1996; Aminov\net al., 2006; Louis & Flint, 2009; Mai & Draganov, 2009)\nbut also is both anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic\n(Hamer et al., 2008; Tazoe et al., 2008). Therefore, consider-\nable interest has been generated by reports that a reduction\nin bacteria within the Firmicutes phylum, especially the\nspecies Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, has been observed in\nthe gut of CD patients and that supernatants from cultures\nof this bacterium are anti-inflammatory (Sokol et al., 2008).\nBecause oxidation of butyrate is the major source of ATP in\ncells lining the colon (Yin et al., 2001), decreased levels of\nFEMS Microbiol Lett 310 (2010) 138\u2013144c\u0002 2010 Federation of European Microbiological Societies\nPublished by Blackwell Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved\nM\nIC\nRO\nBI\nO\nLO\nG\nY\n L\nET\nT\nER\nS\nF. prausnitzii could well reduce ATP within these cells. At the\nsame time, coupled with the loss of anti-inflammatory\nagents from F. prausnitzii, this would, in a double blow,\nweaken the ability of the cells to fight infection (Smith et al.,\n2008). Thus, these findings potentially shed light on the\naetiology of CD and offer a novel therapeutic approach\ninvolving recolonization of the gut with the bacterium.\nTo evaluate these findings and to assess the effects of\nelemental diet therapy (ED) on the population of F. praus-\nnitzii within the gut, faecal samples were collected before\nand after therapy from patients suffering from CD, IBS and\nulcerative colitis (UC) as disease control groups, and also\nfrom healthy controls.\nMaterials and methods\nPatients and control subjects\nTwenty patients diagnosed to be suffering from CD, 21\npatients with IBS, 14 patients with UC and 18 healthy\nsubjects as controls were recruited at Addenbrookes Hospi-\ntal, Cambridge, which functions as a tertiary referral centre\nfor inflammatory bowel disease. A faecal sample and a blood\nsample were taken at the start of the treatment and again\n(except for the controls) 2 weeks later. Faecal samples were\ncollected at the homes of patients and control subjects and\nimmediately stored at 4 1C. Samples were taken to Adden-\nbrookes Hospital, assigned undisclosed identification codes\nand sent by courier at 4 1C to the University of Birmingham\nfor DNA extraction, arriving within 48 h of collection.\nSample identifications were decoded only after data collec-\ntion had been completed. Ethical permission to collect these\nsamples was obtained from Leeds West Ethics Research\nCommittee, ref. 07\/Q1205\/39, and informed, written con-\nsent was obtained from each subject.\nTreatment regimes and assessment of the\neffects of treatment\nMost CD patients attending the Addenbrookes Hospital\ntertiary referral clinic were considered to be relatively\ncomplex cases that had proved refractory to previous\npharmacological treatments. These included steroids and\/\nor immuno modulation therapy (azathioprine or metho-\ntrexate), or 5-ASA. Treatment was chosen by the individual\nconsultant supervising each case, but all included in the\npresent study were given ED (King et al., 1997). All normal\nfood items were withdrawn and patients were maintained\nfor 2 weeks on ED (E 028 Extra, Scientific Hospital Supplies\nInternational, Liverpool, UK), which contains a predigested\nmixture of amino acids, malto-dextrins, minerals and\nvitamins, with a single fat source, rape seed oil. Thus, no\nadditional complex carbohydrate or protein was provided\nfor the gut flora to use as energy substrates other than\nendogenous sources, for example, protein released from\nsloughed cells. Water ad libitum was the only other item\nallowed. The nutritional requirements were individually\ncalculated using the Schofield equation (Schofield, 1985).\nThe efficacy of treatment was assessed on symptoms using\nthe Harvey and Bradshaw index (Harvey & Bradshaw, 1980),\nand by an assay of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) as a\nmeasure of inflammatory stress.\nNone of the UC and IBS patients was given ED. Eleven of\nthe UC patients had received either immuno-modulation or\n5-ASA therapy before this study, and this was continued,\nalbeit with changes in the drugs and increases in the doses\nused. Treatment-na\u0131\u00a8ve patients were placed on similar regi-\nmens. IBS patients received conventional treatment.\nThe Harvey and Bradshaw index and the Walmsley index\nwere used to determine the severity of CD and UC,\nrespectively.\nDNA extraction\nDNA was extracted from each faecal sample (0.2 g) using a\nQIAamp DNA stool Mini Kit (Qiagen) by following the\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions. Extracted DNA was stored in\naliquots at \u0003 20 1C. DNA quality was assessed by determin-\ning the ratio of A260 nm to A280 nm.\nPCR amplification of bacterial DNA\nTwo subgroups of F. prausnitzii have been identified on the\nbasis of their published whole-genome DNA sequences.\nPrimers Fp.ID.F2 (GTGACCGGATCGAACGACC) and\nFp.ID.R2 (TCCAGGTCATGTGGGCAGC) were designed\nagainst the nucleotidyl transferase gene and the butyryl-\nCoA transferase gene, respectively, using the nucleotide\nsequences of both F. prausnitzii A2-165 and M21\/2. Ampli-\ncons from the two F. prausnitzii subgroups could be\ngenerated simultaneously within a single PCR reaction and\ndistinguished by the fragment length: approximately 650 bp\nfor the A2-165-related subgroup and 778 bp for the M21\/2-\nrelated subgroup. For each PCR amplification, 50 ng of DNA\nwas used as a template with HotStarTaq Plus Master Mix Kit\n(Qiagen) plus 4 mL of Q-solution (Qiagen) according to the\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions. The reaction conditions were:\ninitial denaturation (5 min at 95 1C), then 35 cycles of\ndenaturation (1 min at 94 1C), annealing (1 min at 58 1C)\nand elongation (1 min at 72 1C) and a final extension\n(10 min at 72 1C).\nFor samples from which F. prausnitzii was not amplified,\nthe quality of the DNA was confirmed using 50 ng of DNA\nas template in a second PCR with the primers 27F (50-AG\nAGTTTGATCATGGCTCAG-30) and 1492R (50-GGTTACC\nTTGTTACGACTT-30) that annealed to bacterial DNA en-\ncoding 16S rRNA gene (Lane, 1991). These primers amplify\na highly conserved region in the DNA from many bacterial\nFEMS Microbiol Lett 310 (2010) 138\u2013144 c\u0002 2010 Federation of European Microbiological Societies\nPublished by Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

The reaction conditions were as\nfollows: initial denaturation (5 min at 95 1C), then 35 cycles\nof denaturation (30 s at 94 1C), annealing (1 min at 55 1C)\nand elongation (2 min at 72 1C) and a final extension (8 min\nat 72 1C). The reaction mixture was the same as stated\nabove.\nQuantification of amplified DNA\nBecause the same amount of template DNA, 50 ng, was\nadded to each PCR, the differing brightness of the bands\non the gel was used as an indicator of the amount of F.\nprausnitzii in each patient. The intensity of the bands was\nmeasured using the software QUANTITY ONE (Bio-Rad) and\nquantified by comparison with known amounts of a 1-kb\nladder (New England Biolabs). The experiment was repeated\nonce. Samples that failed to yield a PCR product were\nreassayed a third or a fourth time, and the quality of the\nDNA was confirmed by amplification of bacterial 16S rRNA\ngene.\nSerum CRP assay\nSerum CRP levels were determined by the Clinical Biochem-\nistry Department, Addenbrookes Hospital.\nStatistical analyses\nThe results were assessed using nonparametric methods.\nThe results of the estimated amount of each subgroup of\nF. prausnitzii DNA generated by PCR amplification for the\nthree patient groups both pre- and post-treatment and the\ncontrol group were analysed separately using Kruskal\u2013Wal-\nlace one-way ANOVA and Dunn\u2019s post hoc all comparisons test.\nTo gain an estimate of the effects of illness on the total\namount of F. prausnitzii, the results for the controls and the\nthree pretreatment samples were ranked first for the M21\/2\nsubgroup (the larger PCR fragment) and then for the A2-\n165 subgroup (the smaller PCR product), and the two\nranking values for each sample were added together to yield\na combined rank value that was regarded as an estimate of\nthe total F. prausnitzii content of the faeces. Post-treatment\nsamples were analysed in the same way. These two new data\nsets were also analysed using the Kruskal\u2013Wallace one-way\nANOVA and Dunn\u2019s post hoc all comparisons. Paired data were\nanalysed using the Wilcoxon signed rank-sum (WSRS) test.\nKruskal\u2013Wallace analyses were carried out initially using the\nMINITABS statistical package. Data were then reanalysed using\nthe INSTAT (Graphpad) program, which was also used for\nDunn\u2019s post hoc all comparisons (but completed only if the\ntwo-tailed P value was o 0.05 in the Kruskal\u2013Wallace\nanalysis), Mann\u2013Whitney tests for unpaired data, the WSRS\ntest for paired data and Spearman r to determine the level of\ncorrelation between parameters.\nResults\nThe results are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. The original\ndata on which these tables are based are available as\nSupporting Information, Tables S1\u2013S3 in the online version\nof this article.\nSubject characteristics\nThe patient groups consisted of 20 patients diagnosed as\nsuffering from CD, 21 patients with IBS and 14 patients with\nUC. They were recruited at Addenbrookes Hospital, Cam-\nbridge, which functions as a tertiary referral centre for\ninflammatory bowel disease. The patients gave a faecal and\na blood sample at the start of the treatment and again 2\nweeks later. In addition, blood and faecal samples were\nobtained from 18 healthy subjects as controls.\nEffects of treatment on the clinical state\nEighty-four per cent of the initial group of CD patients\nreturned to follow-up clinics. The effects of treatment were\nbeneficial, as evidenced by decreases in the Harvey and\nBradshaw scores of individual patients (Po 0.0001; WSRS\ntest). At presentation, all 15 patients whose serum was\nassayed had serum CRP levels above the upper limit of the\nreference range (6 mg L\u00031). Following treatment, there was a\nsignificant decline in the CRP levels (Po 0.05, WSRS test).\nQuantification of F. prausnitzii-specific PCR\nproducts\nBacterial DNA was obtained from each faecal sample. The\nsame amount of faecal DNA was used as a template in PCR\nreactions with the primer pair Fp.ID.F2 and Fp.ID.R2 to\ndetect the presence of F. prausnitzii. Although the total\nquantity of F. prausnitzii PCR products and the ratio of the\ntwo subgroups varied considerably from sample to sample\n(Fig. 1), only a minority of samples failed to yield one or\nboth F. prausnitzii PCR products. The sequences of PCR\nproducts were 100% identical to those of the published\nTable 1.

Jia et al.\nF. prausnitzii genomes A2-165 or M21\/2, and to no other.\nWhen no F. prausnitzii product was detectable, a second\namplification to produce an amplicon from the DNA\nencoding the 16S rRNA gene was always successful, demon-\nstrating that the bacterial DNA extracted was of good\nquality.\nComparison of F. prausnitzii abundance in the\nfaecal samples\nThere were no significant differences in the levels of the A2-\n165 subgroup of F. prausnitzii in the three treatment groups\nat initial presentation and in the control group (Kruskal\u2013\nWallace P= 0.248, adjusted for ties), although the levels for\nCD patients were the lowest of the four groups. There was a\nsignificant difference among the three post-treatment and\ncontrol groups (Kruskal\u2013Wallace P= 0.006, adjusted for\nties), with the levels for the CD group being significantly\nlower than those of the control group (Dunn\u2019s post hoc test\nPo 0.05). For the CD group, the levels had decreased\nsignificantly post-treatment (WSRS test P= 0.0046).\nThe levels of the M21\/2 F. prausnitzii subgroup were\nanalysed similarly. There was a significant difference among\nthe three pretreatment patient groups and the control group\n(Kruskal\u2013Wallace P= 0.029, adjusted for ties), although the\npost hoc test revealed no significant difference when indivi-\ndual groups were compared with each other, despite lower\nvalues for both the CD and the UC samples. However, for\nthis F. prausnitzii subgroup, the levels in the CD patients\nwere significantly lower than those in the control samples, as\njudged by the Mann\u2013Whitney test (P= 0.02). Following\ntreatment, there was also a significant difference in the levels\nof the M21\/2 subgroup among the three patient groups and\nthe control group (Kruskal\u2013Wallace P= 0.034, adjusted for\nties). The levels in the CD group were significantly lower\nthan those in controls (Dunn\u2019s post hoc Po 0.05), although\nthe difference between the pre- and the post-treatment levels\n(median before treatment 77 compared with 65.5 post-\ntreatment) was not significantly different (WSRS P= 0.61).\nThus, the levels of both F. prausnitzii subgroups for\nCD patients either decreased or remained low rather\nthan increased following successful treatment with an\nenteral diet.\nIt is obvious from Fig. 1 that there were wide differences\nbetween the ratios of the levels of the two F. prausnitzii\nsubgroups between patient samples. However, the overall\ntotal levels of each subgroup were similar, and so it was\nappropriate to lend equal weight to the two subgroups to\ncompare the total levels of F. prausnitzii among the patient\nand control populations. The analyses revealed that the total\nlevels of F. prausnitzii in CD patients were significantly lower\nthan those in the other groups both before and after\ntreatment (Kruskal\u2013Wallace test Po 0.005 before treatment\nand o 0.001 after treatment; Dunn\u2019s comparisons for the\nCD group relative to the control group Po 0.05 before\ntreatment; o 0.001 after treatment).\nTable 2.

All rights reserved\n141Relevance of F. prausnitzii to Crohn\u2019s disease\nLack of a correlation between the levels of\nF. prausnitzii and clinical assessment\nThe levels of each subgroup of F. prausnitzii in CD patients\nwere analysed for correlation with clinical status, as deter-\nmined by the Harvey and Bradshaw scores, both before and\nafter treatment. The data were assessed using the nonpara-\nmetric Spearman r coefficient. As the r value for the A2\u2013165\nsubgroup was 0.018 (P= 0.3) and r= 0.02 (P= 0.92) for the\nM2\/21 group, neither set of F. prausnitzii levels correlated\nwith clinical status.\nFurther analysis of data from samples from the\nUC patients\nThe data for UC patients before treatment appeared to show\nthat the levels of the F. prausnitzii M2\/21 subgroup were\nlower those than in the control group, but the statistical tests\nused failed to establish that the difference was significant.\nWe therefore used the nonparametric Mann\u2013Whitney test to\ncompare the data for this UC subgroup with the controls. As\nthe resulting P value, 0.087, tended towards, but did not\nconfirm that the difference was significant, this is probably a\ntype 2 error: more data are required for this patient group.\nDiscussion\nPrevious studies have established that Firmicutes are domi-\nnant among the diverse range of butyrate-producing bacter-\nia in the human gut, with five species being especially\nabundant: Eubacterium rectal; Roseburia faecis; Eubacterium\nhallii; an unnamed but cultured species, SS2\/1; and F.\nprausnitzii (Aminov et al., 2006; Louis et al., 2009). The\nreport that the levels of F. prausnitzii in the gut of patients\nwith CD were lower than the levels in healthy subjects was\nbased on analysis of tissue taken from patients undergoing\nelective surgery (Sokol et al., 2008). The current study used\nan alternative way of identifying bacteria present in the\nhuman gut, which was to investigate the bacterial compo-\nnent of faecal samples. However, analysis of faecal DNA in\nthe present study only partially confirmed these earlier\nfindings. Although F. prausnitzii, especially the M21\/2 sub-\ngroup, were less abundant in CD patients at presentation\nthan in the control group, contrary to expectation, success-\nful treatment of the CD group resulted in a decrease rather\nthan an increase in F. prausnitzii abundance. It is an open\nquestion as to whether the treatment received by CD\npatients before attendance at the Addenbrookes clinic might\nhave resulted in the statistically significant decline in the\nfaecal levels of F. prausnitzii: a recent study strongly suggests\nthat this might be the case (Benus et al., 2010). However, the\nsubsequent decline following ED treatment clearly excludes\nthe possibility that recovery might be due to an increase in\nF. prausnitzii levels within the gut and the consequent\nincrease in immuno-suppressive agents secreted by the\nbacteria (Sokol et al., 2008).\nThe causes of CD and other gastrointestinal diseases are\nclearly multifactorial, and it is therefore not surprising that\nthe same is true of mechanisms that protect against disease.\nThe previous report clearly established that the positive\neffect of F. prausnitzii in deterring the recurrence of CD\nfollowing surgery was due to the production of an unidenti-\nfied metabolite other than butyrate (Sokol et al., 2008).\nBacteria generate butyrate during fermentation of lactate,\nbut lactate is also the preferred energy source of many other\nbacteria, including propionibacteria, acetogens and sul-\nphate-reducing bacteria (Macpherson et al., 1996). In the\ncurrent study, patients were treated nutritionally with a\nminimal diet that would decrease the availability of lactate\nand hence also decrease the bacterial flora, including F.\nprausnitzii (Chapman et al., 1994; Costello et al., 1994; King\net al., 1997; Whelan et al., 2005; Johnson et al., 2006). It is\nknown that faecal bacterial dry weight in healthy volunteers\nfed ED declines drastically (Costello et al., 1994). A positive\noutcome following treatment might therefore be due to a\ngreater reduction in the production of toxic, inflammatory\nmetabolites by other bacteria relative to any negative effects\nof a decreased population of butyrate-producing bacteria.\nFor example, decreased availability of lactate would select\nagainst sulphate-reducing bacteria such as Desulfovibrio\npiger, which is abundant in human faeces and the major\nsource of sulphide, which inhibits butyrate oxidation by\ncolonocytes (Pitcher & Cummings, 1996; Roediger et al.,\n1997; Willis et al., 1997; Levine et al., 1998; Loubinoux\net al., 2002; Duncan et al., 2004; Fite et al., 2004; Marquet\net al., 2009).\nThe different results reported in this and the previous\nstudy may have arisen from the differences in the material\nassayed. Normally produced stools, which were used in this\nstudy, represent bacterial populations chiefly along the\ncolon, whereas the surgically resected material in the earlier\nstudy were from higher up the alimentary canal. Bacterial\npopulations in the two sites may well differ. Furthermore,\npatients awaiting surgery may have been given enteral or\nparenteral feeds to improve their state of nutrition or fasted\npreoperatively. If the organism is dependent on dietary\ncomplex carbohydrate, these also could have been factors\nleading to the low numbers of F. prausnitzii reported.\nIn conclusion, the clinical improvement in our patients\nwith CD was associated with a decline in the numbers of F.\nprausnitzii, but this does not mean that the organism can be\nconsidered to be a pathogen responsible for producing CD,\nas it was equally frequent in our healthy volunteers. It is\nmore likely to be an innocent bystander, whose numbers\ndecline with ED feeding, which exerts its effects in CD\nthrough its action on the gut microbial communities\n(Hunter, 1991).
