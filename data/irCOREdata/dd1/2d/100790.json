This is\nessentially due to the presence of large shell gaps, the\norigins and configurations of which differ significantly\nalong the chart of nuclides. This implies a variable sensi-\ntivity of these shell gaps with respect to the proton-neutron\nasymmetry. For instance, the N \u0001 20 shell closure, bound\nby orbitals of opposite parity, d3=2 below and f7=2 above,\nremains remarkably rigid against quadrupole deformation\nfrom 4020Ca to 3414Si even after the removal of six protons [1].\nThis feature can be traced back to the large N \u0001 20 gap,\nthe hindrance of 2\u0002 excitations due to the change of parity\nacross it, and to the presence of proton subshell gaps in the\nsd shells at Z \u0001 16 (\u00052:5 MeV) and Z \u0001 14 (\u00054:3 MeV)\n[2,3]. Conversely, the N \u0001 28 shell closure, produced by\nthe spin-orbit (SO) interaction and separating the orbitals\nof same parity f7=2 and p3=2, is progressively eroded below\nthe doubly magic 4820Ca nucleus in 4618Ar [4] and 4416S [5,6],\nafter the removal of only two and four protons, respec-\ntively. This rapid disappearance of rigidity of the N \u0001 28\nisotones has been ascribed to the reduction of the neutron\nshell gap N \u0001 28 combined with that of the proton sub-\nshell gap Z \u0001 16, leading to increased probability of quad-\nrupole excitations within the fp and sd shells for neutrons\nand protons, respectively. For the 44S nucleus, its small 2\u0002\nenergy, large B\u0003E2\u0004 value [5], and the presence of a 0\u00022\nisomer at low excitation energy [6] point to a mixed ground\nstate configuration of spherical and deformed shapes. As\nthe proton Z \u0001 14 and neutron N \u0001 28 (sub)shell gaps\nhave been proven to be effective in 3414Si and 48Ca28, re-\nspectively, the search for a new doubly magic nucleus\nwould be naturally oriented towards 4214Si28, which could\nbe the lightest one with proton and neutron gaps created by\nthe SO interaction.\nThe experimental status concerning the structure of 42Si\nis rather controversial. On the one hand the very short\n\u0002-decay lifetimes of the 40\u20134214 Si nuclei point to deformed\nground state configurations in the Si isotopic chain [7]. On\nthe other hand, the weak two proton knockout cross section\n\u0003\u00062p\u000344S ! 42Si\u0004 was given as a strong indication in favor\nof a magic spherical nucleus [8] with a large Z \u0001 14 shell\ngap. However, the same authors have shown more recently\n[9] that a reduction of the Z \u0001 14 gap by as much as 1 MeV\nPRL 99, 022503 (2007) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending13 JULY 2007\n0031-9007=07=99(2)=022503(4) 022503-1 \u00a9 2007 The American Physical Society\ndoes not increase the \u0003\u00062p value significantly. Further, the\nnewly measured atomic mass of 42Si [10] is compatible\nwith an excess of microscopic energy as compared to a\nspherical liquid drop, which could be obtained either for a\nspherical or deformed shell closure.\nThe present work aimed at determining the 2\u0002 energy of\n42\n14Si28 and the energy spectrum of the neutron-rich\n41;43\n15 P26;28 isotopes to obtain a global understanding of the\nproton and neutron excitations at Z \u0001 14 and N \u0001 28 to\ninfer whether 42Si can be considered as a new doubly\nmagic nucleus or not.\nThe experiment was carried out at the Grand Acce\u00b4le\u00b4ra-\nteur National d\u2019Ions Lourds (GANIL) facility. A primary\nbeam of 48Ca at 60A MeV impinged onto a 200 mg=cm2 C\ntarget with a mean intensity of 3:8 \u0004A to produce a cock-\ntail of projectilelike fragments. They were separated by the\nALPHA spectrometer, the magnetic rigidity of which was set\nto optimize the transmission of the 44S nuclei, produced at\na rate of 125 s\u00061. Fragments were guided over a flight path\nof about 80 m along which the time of flight (TOF) was\ndetermined with two microchannel plates. A thin 50 \u0004m Si\ndetector was used to determine the energy losses (\u0001E),\nwhich completed the event by event identification prior to\nthe fragmentation in a secondary target of 195 mg=cm2 of\n9Be. This target was placed at the entrance of the SPEG\nspectrometer, the magnetic rigidity of which was tuned to\nmaximize the transmission of the 42Si nuclei produced\nthrough a 2 proton knockout reaction. At the focal plane\nof SPEG, ionization and drift chambers provided informa-\ntion on the \u0001E and positions of the transmitted nuclei,\nwhile a plastic scintillator was used to determine TOF and\nresidual energies. The \u0003\u00062p\u000344S ! 42Si\u0004 cross section is\nmeasured to be 80\u000310\u0004 \u0004b at 39A MeV. This agrees with\nthe value of 120\u000320\u0004 \u0004b obtained at 98:6A MeV [8], after\nhaving taken into account a enhancement factor of 25%\ndue to the higher beam energy [11].\nAn array of 74 BaF2 crystals, each of 9 cm diameter and\n14 cm length, was arranged in two hemispheres above and\nbelow the Be target at a mean distance of 25 cm to detect \u0001\nrays arising from the secondary reactions. The energy\nthreshold of the detectors was around 100 keV. The ener-\ngies of two \u0001 rays detected in coincidence in adjacent\ndetectors were combined by addback. The \u0001-ray energies\nwere corrected for Doppler shifts due to the in-flight emis-\nsion by the fragments. Photopeak efficiencies of 38% at\n779 keV, 24% at 1.33 MeV, and 16% at 2 MeV were\nachieved for fragments with v=c \u2019 0:3. The energy reso-\nlution was 15% at 800 keV and 12% at 1.4 MeV, which\nincludes the effects of the intrinsic resolution of the detec-\ntors and the Doppler broadening. Using the systematics of\nthe peak widths deduced from the observation of known\nsingle peaks, doublets of \u0001 rays could also be disentangled.\nThe time resolution of the array was 800 ps. This enabled a\nclean separation between neutrons or charged particles and\nthe \u0001 rays arising from the reaction on the basis of their\nTOF differences.\n\u0001-ray spectra obtained for the 42Si and 41;43P isotopes are\nshown in Fig. 1. Several other nuclei were also produced,\nsuch as 38;40Si and 44S. Noteworthy is the fact that we find\ngood agreement with their previously measured \u0001 transi-\ntions, published in Refs. [5,12]. A clear single peak is\nvisible in the spectrum of 42Si at 770(19) keV on a signifi-\ncance level of more than 3\u0003. It can be assigned to the decay\nof the first excited state, namely, the 2\u00021 ! 0\u00021 transition.\nThe number of counts corresponds to a feeding of the 2\u0002\nstate of 44\u0007 10%. In 43P, in addition to the low energy\ntransition at 186 keV previously reported by Fridmann\net al. [8], a doublet of weak transitions is visible at 789\nand 918 keV. Both transitions are in coincidence with the\n186 keV transition and are placed on top of it in the\nproposed level scheme (Fig. 2). In 41P, similarly to the\n43P case, a strong low energy transition at 172(12) keV is\nvisible together with several slightly overlapping peaks at\n420, 964, 1146, and 1408 keV. The 964 and 1408 keV\ntransitions are in coincidence with the 172 keV transition,\nwhile the 964 keV transition is in coincidence with that at\n420 keV, too.

The present observation of new\n\u0001 lines in the 43P and 42Si is explained by an enhanced \u0001\nefficiency by about a factor of 10 at 1 MeV with respect to\nthe work of Refs. [8,9].\nFigure 3 shows the energies of the 2\u0002 states in the Si and\nCa isotopes. The correlated increase of the 2\u0002 energies in\nthe 40Ca and 34Si nuclei at N \u0001 20 does not hold at N \u0001\n28. While 2\u0002 energies increase in Ca isotopes from N \u0001\n24 to reach a maximum around 4 MeV at N \u0001 28, the 2\u0002\nenergies in the Si isotopes start to deviate from those of the\nCa at N \u0001 26, reaching a minimum value at N \u0001 28. The\nslight deviation from the Ca curve at N \u0001 26 was inter-\npreted in Ref. [12] as an indication in favor of a reduced\nN \u0001 28 shell gap. However, neutron excitations occurring\nbefore the complete filling of the \u0005f7=2 shell are not\nespecially sensitive to the N \u0001 28 gap, as the 2\u0002 states\nare qualitatively due to excitations inside the f7=2 shell.\nConversely, in 42Si28 the 2\u0002 state comes from particle-hole\nexcitations across the gap and therefore, the dramatic\ndecrease of its 2\u0002 energy leaves no doubt concerning the\ndisappearance of the spherical N \u0001 28 shell closure at Z \u0001\n14, the energy of 770 keV being one of the smallest among\nnuclei having a similar mass. It is worth pointing out, as\nshown in Fig. 2, that the decrease of the 2\u0002 energies in the\n40;42Si nuclei is correlated to the behavior of those states\nobserved around 1 MeV in the 41;43P isotones, which in the\nshell model arise from the coupling of the last proton in the\ns1=2 or d3=2 orbitals to the 2\u0002 excitation. This provides\nadditional support to the disappearance of the N \u0001 28\nspherical gap. If the N \u0001 28 gap had persisted in the P\nisotopes, a sequence of levels similar to those in 47K would\nhave been observed, namely two nearby 1=2\u0002 and 3=2\u0002\nstates originating from the quasidegeneracy of the \u0006s1=2\nand \u0006d3=2 orbitals and a large gap in energy (\u00052 MeV)\nabove this doublet.\nThe spectroscopy of the nuclei with proton number in\nthe range of 16 to 20 and neutron number from 20 to 28 is\nreproduced successfully when using large scale shell\nmodel calculations in a valence space comprising the full\nsd shells for protons and pf shells for neutrons with the\neffective interaction SDPF-NR [13]. The remarkable fea-\ntures of this interaction which account for the evolution of\nthe nuclear structure between N \u0001 20 and N \u0001 28 are\n(i) the decrease of the d3=2-s1=2 proton splitting by about\n2.5 MeV from 39K20 to 47K28 as the neutron f7=2 orbital is\nfilled and (ii) the reduction of the N \u0001 28 gap by about\n330 keV per pair of protons [4] removed from the 48Ca.\nDespite these successes, a correct description of the Si\nisotopes cannot be straightforwardly obtained by using the\nmonopole matrix elements of the SDPF-NR interaction\nderived for the Ca isotopes. This arises from the fact that\nthe occupied and valence proton orbitals involved in both\ncases are somewhat different. In particular, some amount\nof core excitations to the \u0006f7=2 orbital, which lies just\nabove the valence space of the Ca isotopes, is included in\nthe neutron-pairing matrix elements Vnn of pf-shell orbits.\nThis contribution is expected to be negligible in the Si\nisotopes, in which the \u0006f7=2 orbital lies at much higher\nexcitation energy. According to the model, the configura-\ntion of the 2\u0002 states in 36;38;40Si arises mainly from pair-\nbreaking inside the \u0005f7=2 shell and therefore the 2\u0002 ener-\ngies scale with the Vnn values. Indeed the energy of the 2\u0002\nstates in 36;38;40Si [1,12,14] and those of the 5=2\u0002 states in\n37;39P [15] are overestimated by the SDPF-NR interaction\nup to 300\u2013400 keV. The discrepancy is larger for 42Si, the\ncalculated 2\u0002 energy of which being 1.49 MeV, instead of\n770 keV. Therefore, a reduction of the pf shell Vnn matrix\nelements by 300 keV gives the 2\u0002 energies of 36;38;40Si as\nwell as the 5=2\u0002 energies in 37;39P [15] in agreement with\ntheir experimental values. Nevertheless the calculated\n2\u0002 energy in 42Si, 1.1 MeV, is still larger than the experi-\nmental value. To further reduce it without changing the\nproperties of the other N \u0001 28 isotones, the proton-neutron\nmonopole matrix elements Vpnd5=2\u0003fp\u0004 can be considered.\nIndeed, the d5=2 orbital is \u2018\u2018active\u2019\u2019 in the Si isotopes\nwhereas it is too deeply bound to play a significant role\nin the description of the Ca isotopes. Nevertheless, with the\nSDPF-NR interaction the proton d3=2-d5=2 splitting in 39K\nand 47K overestimates the experimental values, see Table I.\nCa\nSi\nNeutron number (N)\n18 20 22 24 26 28 30\n \nen\ner\ngy\n (M\neV\n)\n+ 2\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\nFIG. 3.

This modifica-\ntion leads to a decrease of the d3=2-d5=2 splitting by\n1.94 MeV from 34Si to 42Si which results in an enhanced\ncollectivity. 42Si becomes clearly an oblate rotor up to J \u0001\n8\u0002; with a calculated 2\u0002 excitation energy of 810 keV and\nan intrinsic quadrupole moment Qi of \u000687e fm2 corre-\nsponding to a quadrupole deformation \u0002 \u0001 \u00060:45. The\ndoubly magic (N \u0001 28, Z \u0001 14) component is only 20%\nof the ground state wave function with an average 2.2\nneutrons above N \u0001 28 and 1.2 protons above Z \u0001 14;\nthe percentage of the closed proton configuration \u00030d5=2\u00046\nbeing 33%. With a present Z \u0001 14 gap of 5.8 MeV, our\nmeasured \u0003\u00062p\u000344S ! 42Si\u0004 cross section agrees with the\none calculated with a similar gap in Ref. [9].\nThe resulting shell model description of the N \u0001 20 to\nN \u0001 28 region south of Ca isotopes is the following: as\ncompared to the 34Si and 48Ca nuclei, major changes in the\nenergies of the proton and neutron orbitals are occurring\ntowards 42Si. The complete filling of the neutron f7=2 shell\nfrom 34Si leads to a shrinkage of the sd orbitals, with a\nproton SO splitting d3=2-d5=2 reduced by about 1.94 MeV.\nThis reduction is compatible with what is accounted for by\ntensor forces, which act attractively (repulsively) between\nthe proton and neutron orbits d3=2-f7=2 (d5=2-f7=2) as de-\nscribed in Refs. [17,18]. Simultaneously, as depicted in\nRef. [4] the removal of protons from 48Ca induces a\ncompression in energy of the four neutron fp orbits and\nhence a reduction of the N \u0001 28 gap by about 1 MeV in\n42Si (from an initial value of 4.8 MeV in 48Ca) due to the\ncombined effects of the proton-neutron tensor force and the\ndensity dependence of the SO interaction. The overall\npicture would be then that the mutual actions of the\nproton-neutron tensor forces in 42Si induce the reduction\nof the neutron N \u0001 28 gap and limit the size of the proton\nZ \u0001 14 gap. In addition, particle-hole excitations between\noccupied and valence orbitals which are separated by \u0001\u2018,\nj \u0001 2 for both protons (sd) and neutrons (fp) naturally\nfavor quadrupole correlations that generate collectivity\nthrough mechanisms related to Elliott\u2019s SU(3) symmetry\n[19]. The combined effects of the compression of the\nproton and neutron orbitals, plus the quadrupole excita-\ntions, produce a rich variety of behaviors and shapes in the\neven N \u0001 28 isotones; spherical 48Ca; oblate noncollective\n46Ar; coexistence in 44S, and two rotors, oblate 42Si and\nprolate 40Mg. This variety of shapes is also globally sup-\nported by mean field calculations, relativistic or nonrela-\ntivistic [20\u201324].\nTo summarize, the energies of excited states in the 42Si\nand the 41;43P nuclei have been measured through in-beam\n\u0001-ray spectroscopy. The low energy of the 2\u00021 state in 42Si,\n770(19) keV, together with the level schemes of 41;43P,\nprovides evidence for the disappearance of the N \u0001 28\nshell closure around 42Si. It is ascribed to the combined\naction of proton-neutron tensor forces leading to a global\ncompression of the proton and neutron single particle\norbits, added to the quadrupole symmetry between the\noccupied and valence states which favors excitations\nacross the Z \u0001 14 and N \u0001 28 shell gaps.\nThis work benefits from discussions with A.
