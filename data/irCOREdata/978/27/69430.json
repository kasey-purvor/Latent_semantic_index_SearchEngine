INTRODUCTION\nTHIS PAPER gives time-domain measurements and analy-sis of the response of an injection-locked continuous-\nwave (CW) \u201ccooker\u201d magnetron to changes in the phase and\nfrequency of its injection signal. Effectively, the magnetron is\nbeing operated as a narrow-band reflection amplifier [1]\u2013[3].\nRecent work by the authors has shown how injection power\ncan be minimized and operation stabilized in the presence\nof considerable power supply ripple and load fluctuation by\nprecise control of the anode current [4]. The output frequency\nthe magnetron would have without injection is kept close to the\ninjection frequency by utilization of the magnetron\u2019s pushing\ncharacteristic. Our technique differs from that described by\nShinohara et al. [5] in that current control is tightly integrated\ninto the control circuits of the switch-mode power supply.\nThe reflection amplifier described here achieves 27\u201334 dB of\namplification for phase-shift-keyed (PSK) information at data\nrates up to 2 Mb\/s with no bit errors for large data files\n(\u0001 1 Mb). The ability of an injection-locked magnetron to\nfollow rapid phase reversal with fidelity and without noise\ndegradation has previously been reported by Weglein and Leach\n[6]. Studying the response of the magnetron to a changing injec-\ntion signal as a function of heater power, injection level, anode\ncurrent, and load impedance gives new insight on the lock-\ning mechanism, magnetron noise performance, and twining.\nManuscript received January 5, 2006; revised April 19, 2006. This work was\nsupported in part by the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council,\nU.K., and in part by e2v Technologies Ltd. The review of this paper was\narranged by Editor W. Menninger.\nThe authors are with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Lancaster\nUniversity, Lancaster LA1 4YR, U.K. (e-mail: a.dexter@lancaster.ac.uk).\nDigital Object Identifier 10.1109\/TED.2006.876268\nSignificant departures from the phase response predicted by\nthe Adler equation are identified for regimes of space-charge-\nlimited emission. The work also gives data in accordance with\nBrown\u2019s explanation of certain aspects of magnetron noise\n[7], [8]. Brown describes two noise states of the cooker mag-\nnetron, namely 1) a low-noise state when emission from the\ncathode is temperature limited and 2) a high noise state when\nemission from the cathode is space charge limited, i.e., the\nfilament temperature is higher than it needs to be. He deter-\nmined excess emission and hence the point of temperature-\nlimited emission by applying a step voltage to the anode [9] and\nobserving the magnitude of the initial step change in the anode\ncurrent. Measurements here show how the phase settles after\na 90\u25e6 shift as a function of heater power. The measurements\nhere and the measurements of Brown relate primarily to close-\nto-carrier noise. As early as 1977, close-to-carrier phase noise\nfor 25 to 50 W positive-anode military magnetrons had been\nreported to be very low, with frequency-domain measurements\npublished by Garrigus [10] implying a root-mean-square (rms)\nphase jitter of about 4\u25e6.\nThis paper utilizes cooker magnetrons (so named because\nthey are found in commercial microwave cooking ovens) rather\nthan military magnetrons. An excellent review of noise spectra\nfrom cooker magnetrons is given by Osepchuk [11]. Recent\nnoise data for a cooker magnetron driven from a half-wave\nrectified source has been given by Mitani et al. [12]. New tech-\nniques to reduce noise from magnetrons at start up and when\ndriven from half-wave sources are of current interest [13]\u2013[15].\nThe ultimate aim of this paper is to investigate whether\nmagnetrons can be used to drive high-Q cavities for long\npulse and CW accelerator applications. An important aspect\nof driving accelerator cavities is the need to compensate for\ndetuning factors such as vibration. Any practical RF system for\nan accelerator must be able to vary its phase on a relatively short\ntimescale as required to maintain the phase of the accelerator\ncavity with respect to charged bunches in the accelerated beam.\nThe motivation for investigating magnetrons for accelerator\napplications is that the capital outlay per kilowatt for producing\nRF in the gigahertz frequency range using magnetron technol-\nogy is much less than that for producing RF with klystrons or\ninductive output tubes (IOTs). Minimization of cost is likely\nto be crucial for future high-energy-physics accelerators. The\ncost savings that magnetrons offer come from their smaller\nsize, their higher efficiency, and their lower anode voltage. The\nsmaller size gives big cost savings for the magnet. The lower an-\node voltage greatly reduces the cost of the power supply. Where\nmultiple sources are needed to drive an accelerator, phase\ncontrol is crucial.

The mag-\nnetron used for this work was a 1.2-kW CW Panasonic 2 M137.\nThe current to the magnetron is supplied by a switch-mode\npower supply. The chopper pulsewidth controls the output\ncurrent of the power supply. Rather than operating the power\nsupply at constant current, the current is varied to keep the\nmagnetron running at close to a steady frequency (even in\nthe absence of the injection signal). This is possible as the\nfrequency the magnetron would have in the absence of a locking\nsignal is a function of the magnetron current. Current to the\nmagnetron is thereby controlled by a phase-locked loop (PLL).\nPhase frequency detection for the PLL was implemented with\na low-cost ADF 4113 IC. The output of this chip is a series of\ncurrent pulses whose length is proportional to the phase differ-\nence. The measured phase difference can be up to 2\u03c0S, where S\nis the division ratio of the input signal. The absolute reference\nwas provided by a 1-ppm 10-MHz temperature-compensated\ncrystal oscillator. The division ratio N for the reference signal\nwas set as 50 for most of the work, thereby permitting PLL\ncontrol frequency adjustments in steps of 200 kHz. The division\nratio S is then determined as the required magnetron output\nfrequency divided by 200 kHz.\nThe loop filter acts as a proportional\/integral controller and\nhence determines how the switch-mode power supply\u2019s output\nvaries in response to a phase error. The loop filter was optimized\nfor magnetron anode currents in the range of 180\u2013380 mA.\nThe loop filter needs a differing optimization dependent on\nFig. 2. PSK modulation signal (upper trace) being applied to a 1-W mi-\ncrowave injection signal and the associated demodulated magnetron output, i.e.,\nthe magnetron phase (lower trace) for a cathode heater power of 10 W.\nthe gradient of the pushing curve [4]. Frequency control of the\nmagnetron by the technique described ceases to work where the\ngradient of the pushing curve is zero.\nThe injection signal is shown in Fig. 1 as being derived\nfrom one of two RF sources via a fast pin diode switch and\nfed to a 1-W amplifier. For the demonstration of PSK, the RF\nsource B was derived from source A with an adjustable phase\nshifter. Independent sources were used for the demonstration\nof frequency shift keying (FSK). These sources were derived\nfrom voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs) controlled by sep-\narate ADF 4113 ICs. A double-balanced mixer was used to\ndemodulate signals amplified by the magnetron.\nIt should be noted that the ripple performance of the 325-V\ndc supply has been improved from 5% to 3% by addition of\nextra smoothing capacitance with respect to previously reported\nwork [4]. This new ripple performance is still consistent with a\nlow-cost switch-mode power supply.\nIII. PSK MODULATION\nFig. 2 shows on its upper trace a data signal going to the fast\nswitch in Fig. 1. The lower trace of Fig. 2 shows a snapshot of\nthe output from the double-balanced mixer on an oscilloscope.\nThe figure relates to an injection frequency of 2.4519866 GHz,\nan injection power of 1 W, switching between two phases 90\u25e6\napart at 0.5 MHz (= 1 Mb\/s) and a heater power of 10 W.\nThe control frequency for the PLL that adjusts current\nthrough the magnetron anode was also set to 2.4519866 GHz.\nThe microwave signal input to the double-balanced mixer was\nsampled from the magnetron output waveguide with a 60-dB\ndirectional coupler. Fig. 2 shows the magnetron adjusting its\noutput phase to that of the 1-W injection signal in about 500 ns.\nSwitching times were found to depend on the injection power,\nthe heater power, the anode current, and the impedance of the\nload, i.e., the magnitude and phase of power reflected back to\nthe magnetron.\nWhen the magnetron is turned off while the injection signal\nis still present, the step voltage between the phases measured\nby the double-balanced mixer falls by about 30 dB. This fall\nrelates to signal gain achieved by the magnetron. More precise\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library. Downloaded on July 27, 2009 at 06:16 from IEEE Xplore.

Spectrum for magnetron output corresponding to the lower oscillo-\nscope trace in Fig. 2.\nmeasurements of gain have been made with a spectrum ana-\nlyzer. The bandwidth of the magnetron output before injection\nlocking is about 500 kHz and depends in part on the dc\npower supply ripple. The bandwidth for the magnetron locked\nwith a steady injection signal is very small, and the output\nfrequency perturbations associated with 50- and 100-Hz ripple\nform distinct sidebands in the spectrum [4].\nWhen the injection signal is given a regular PSK modulation,\nits spectrum acquires new bands shifted from the center injec-\ntion frequency by the frequency of modulation. Fig. 3 shows the\nspectrum of the input injection signal to the magnetron as asso-\nciated with the modulation for the upper trace in Fig. 2. Fig. 4\nshows the spectrum for the magnetron output corresponding to\nthe lower trace in Fig. 2. Note that the input reference level\nfor Fig. 3 is \u221230 dBm, whereas the input reference level for\nFig. 4 is 0 dBm.\nFor a perfectly square modulation with equal periods of 90\u25e6\nphase-shifted output, the three central peaks in the spectrum\nwill have the same height as can be seen in Fig. 3. As the time\nrequired for the new phase to establish itself increases, then\nthe heights of the two sidebands on either side of the center\nband are reduced. Shutting down the magnetron with the in-\njection signal carrying data still applied and measuring the\nreduction in the height of the sidebands determines the effective\namplification of signal information by the magnetron. For a\n90\u25e6 phase shift at 1 Mb\/s on a 1-W locking signal and for a\nmagnetron heater power of 10 W and anode current of 200 mA,\na 27-dB reduction in the sidebands was observed when the\nmagnetron was deenergized.\nIV. DEPENDENCY ON HEATER POWER\nFig. 2 showing the phase switching time for one specific\noperating point was taken as a snap shot. As the magnetron\nswitching time has a dependence on the heater power, it there-\nfore has a dependence on the 50-Hz heater power ripple. The\nswitching time also depends on the magnetron anode current\nand hence depends on the 100-Hz power supply ripple. The\ndouble-balanced mixer output showing phase as a function of\ntime has therefore both 50- and 100-Hz jitter.\nThe dependence of switching time on heater power and\nanode current are displayed most clearly when the double-\nbalanced mixer output is averaged over multiples of 20 ms.\nUsing averaged outputs, Fig. 5 shows the demodulated mag-\nnetron output into a matched load as a function of heater power.\nBecause the center frequency of the magnetron output is fixed,\nthe anode current variation with heater power is seen.\nThe response to the change in phase has the appearance of\na second-order system going from being over damped for low\nheater powers to being under damped at high heater powers.\nThis transition depends on the anode current with respect to\nthe heater power. Working at anode currents near to 220 mA,\nthe transition is seen most clearly. At higher anode currents,\ncorresponding to higher frequencies, the oscillation at high\nheater powers is less pronounced (figures not shown). Fig. 5\nis also asymmetric with respect to the direction of the phase\nchange. In the figure, the upper voltage level corresponds to the\nadvanced phase, whereas the lower voltage level corresponds\nto the retarded phase. It can be seen that retarding the phase\n(switching down) is more responsive than advancing the phase.\nThe switching response has also been investigated for un-\nmatched loads. For small amounts of reflected power at phases\nbetween 45\u25e6 and 105\u25e6 toward the load from the point on the\nRieke diagram of maximum efficiency, the oscillations at higher\nheater currents and relatively low anode currents (about 220 mA\nin this case) are almost undamped. Fig. 6 shows magnetron\nswitching response as a function of heater power for a load\nimpedance that reflects 13% of the power back to the magnetron\nat a phase of approximately 100\u25e6 toward the load from the phase\non the Rieke diagram yielding maximum efficiency. The last\ntrace in Fig. 6 shows the weakly damped oscillations.\nThe response was also measured for \u223c 10% reflected power\nat phase intervals of 15\u25e6 over the full 360\u25e6. Figs. 5 and 6 broadly\nencompass the range of characteristic response.\nLight can be cast on possible mechanisms that explain the\nswitching behavior by considering the anode current during\nswitching and also pushing curves as a function of heater power.\nFigs. 7 and 8 show the magnetron anode current referenced\nto the magnetron phase as it switches. The figures have been\ndetermined for differing injection frequencies and hence have\ndiffering currents. (The PLL control frequency was the same as\nthe injection frequency in each case.)\nThe figures show that in regions where the phase gets\nretarded, the magnitude of the anode current reduces, then\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

In Fig. 7, the increase in current is about\n40 mA, whereas in Fig. 8, it is about 60 mA.

DISCUSSION OF THE LOCKING MECHANISM\nFor the magnetron to respond to a change in phase of the\ninjection signal, it must either increase or decrease its output\nfrequency until the phases are synchronized again.

Anode current (lower trace) referenced to the magnetron phase (upper\ntrace) for 90\u25e6 phase shifts, a heater power of 43 W, an injection power of\n1 W, and a matched load. The scale for the lower trace (the anode current) is\n20 mA per tick mark, and its zero is marked on the left-hand scale with a 2.\nThe average anode current (measured independently from scope trace) =\n\u2212330 mA, frequency = 2.4512 GHz.\nFig. 8. As Fig. 7 except for the load, average anode current = \u2212285 mA,\nfrequency = 2.4522 GHz.\n(\u03c9o\/QL)((Ye\/YL)\u2212 1) vanishes. One then sees that \u03c9o is the\nsteady-state frequency in the absence of an injection signal.\nWhen an injection signal is applied, the steady-state solution\nbecomes\nV (t) = VRF cos(\u03c9it+ \u03c8) (2)\nwhere \u03c8 is the phase error between the magnetron output and\nthe injection signal, and VRF is the circuit voltage associated\nwith the RF power delivered by the magnetron. If now the injec-\ntion signal is given a sudden phase shift \u03c6, i.e., Vinj cos(\u03c9it)\u2192\nVinj cos(\u03c9it+ \u03c6), then V\u00a8 must instantaneously change to\nensure that the circuit (1) is balanced. Changing V\u00a8 immediately\nchanges the period and hence the frequency, although \u03c9o and \u03c9i\nremain unchanged.

Diagram showing the magnetron spoke position referenced to anode\nvane behind the spoke at the instant that vane takes its peak positive charge.\nfrom (1) by assuming in (2) that \u03c8 and VRF are slowly varying\nfunctions of time. The derivation requires one to neglect second\nderivatives, products of two first derivatives, and products of\nfirst derivatives with (\u03c9o\/QL)((Ye\/YL)\u2212 1). The Adler equa-\ntion predicts that phase locking has a first-order response with a\ntime constant given by (QL\/\u03c9o)\n\u221a\nPRF\/Pinj, where PRF is the\nRF power output that varies with V 2RF and Pinj is the injection\npower that varies as V 2inj. It also predicts that the response for\nadvancing and retarding the phase is symmetric. For the mag-\nnetron used here, the loaded QL was close to 100. The injection\npower for the figures presented above was typically 1 W, and the\noutput power was typically 1000 W; hence, the anticipated time\nconstant for changing the phase is 400 ns. Some of the traces in\nFigs. 5 and 6 show response times close to 200 ns and also that\nthe response is second order and asymmetric. Instead of using\nthe Adler equation to estimate the response, one can solve (1)\nnumerically after making some assumption on the dependence\nof the electronic admittance on the power output. If one sets\n(Ye\/YL)\u2212 1 = 1\u2212 (V 2\/V 2sat), where Vsat is the steady-state\nRF output voltage, one obtains the Van der Pol oscillator [23].\nSolving this case numerically, the response time for a 90\u25e6 shift\nis nearer to 600 ns than 400 ns as given by the Adler equation.\nIt is well known that the magnetron shifts its frequency by\npushing effects as well as by pulling effects. We postulate that\nthe discrepancy in the response occurs through the mechanism\nthat also explains the magnetron\u2019s pushing characteristic [24].\nThe magnetron can increase or decrease its output frequency by\nchanging the capacitive coupling between the spokes and the\nanode vanes. This happens as the spokes move to or away from\nthe positively charged vanes referenced to a phase when the\nvane carries its maximum positive charge. A movement toward\nthe vane increases the capacitance and decreases the output\nfrequency, whereas a movement away from the vane decreases\nthe capacitance and increases the output frequency (see Fig. 9).\nAs the spokes advance toward the midpoint between the\nvanes, the electrons in the spokes see a stronger circumferential\nretarding force, the RF power output increases, and the radial\ncurrent flow through the spokes increases. The increase in the\ncurrent is of course dependent on the ability of the power supply\nand cathode to deliver it. If the power supply or the cathode\ncannot respond, then either the subsynchronous zone shrinks\nor charge in the spokes is reduced, both outcomes resulting in\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Effect of an injection signal, horizontal axis is time.\nthe capacitance not increasing, as it should. This explanation\nis consistent with Brown\u2019s observations on the magnetron\u2019s\nresponse to steps in the anode voltage [9].\nFor a magnetron to generate power, the spokes must remain\nsynchronized to the pi-mode. Synchronization occurs because\nas a spoke gets closer to the positively charged vane behind it at\nthe phase of peak positive charge (apppc), it sees an increasing\nradial field that increases the circumferential drift velocity. (The\ndrift velocity is the average velocity of the cycloidal motion of\nthe electrons determined by E \u00d7B\/B2.) There is a position of\nthe spokes forward from the positively charged vane (apppc)\nwhere the circumferential drift velocity of electrons in the\nspokes matches the phase velocity of the pi-mode. Moving back\nfrom this point, the circumferential drift velocity increases,\nwhereas moving forward of this point, the circumferential drift\nvelocity reduces.\nA full description of the locking mechanism for magnetrons\nrequires consideration of how the spokes adjust the frequency\nand phase of oscillations in the magnetron cavities in response\nto the injection signal. Figs. 7 and 8 of the magnetron output\nphase against time show that the magnetron output frequency\ntakes a large step change at the instant that the injection signal\ntakes a new phase. The new magnetron output frequency is\nexperimentally deduced from the rate of change of phase added\nto the double-balanced mixer reference frequency, which, in\nthis case, is the magnetron output frequency when the phase\nis not being switched. Close inspection of the figures indicates\nthat after the initial large jump in frequency, the frequency dif-\nference continues to increase very slightly, taking its maximum\nvalue well into the phase correction.\nThe contribution to the injection-locking mechanism from\npushing effects can be explained with reference to Fig. 10.\nFig. 10 shows hypothetical potentials in the output cavity as a\nfunction of time. It shows the injection potential as a grey line,\nthe total potential as a dashed line, and the total potential minus\nthe injection potential (the cavity potential) as a solid black line.\nThe injection signal is initially advanced by 90\u25e6 from the cavity\noscillation. (It is drawn here with a much larger amplitude than\nis typically used for clarity of description.) The resultant field\nis very slightly advanced from the original oscillation. This\nmeans that the spokes have not got as far at the instant when\nthe positive charge on the vane immediately behind the spoke\nis at its maximum. The capacitance is increased, and hence, the\nmagnetron output frequency is decreased from the outset. (With\nreference to (1), \u03c9o changes, and hence, there is an immediate\nchange in V\u00a8 .) Fig. 10 shows the cavity potential at a lower\nfrequency than the injection potential. The new relative position\nfor the spoke should also allow a step change in the current,\nalthough this change is not seen as a sharp step in the external\ncircuit by our oscilloscope. Because the magnetron anode cir-\ncuit is oscillating at a lower frequency than the injection signal,\nits phase retards to that of the injection signal.\nWith the spokes in an earlier position, electrons in the spoke\nsee a smaller retarding field, and hence, the radial drift velocity\nis reduced. This will cause the charge density of the spoke\nto increase. This is possibly why the frequency difference\ncontinues to increase slightly before it decreases. The spoke\nis also in a large radial field and hence will have an increased\ncircumferential drift velocity that starts to move it back to its\nequilibrium position. Of course, this position depends on the\nfrequency of the magnetron pi-mode at any instant and is not\nback to its original value until the phase shift is complete. As\nyet, we do not have a good model for the dynamic response\nof the spokes. At high heater powers, the data suggest that the\nspokes may oscillate about their equilibrium position, causing\nthe frequency and phase to oscillate as the capacitance changes.\nIt should be noted that the magnetron models of Hull [25],\nVaughan [26], and Riyopoulos [27] all fix the phase of spoke\nwith respect to the electromagnetic wave such that the dc power\ninput to the magnetron equals the RF output plus losses. In\nthose papers, no attempt is made to find the phase of the spoke\nfrom the steady-state solution of a dynamic model.\nHow the current changes at the instant the relative position\nof the spokes changes has a dependence on the external high-\nvoltage dc circuit and stored charge in the subsynchronous\nzone. Figs. 7 and 8 suggest that it is easier for the magnetron\nspokes to draw less current than it is for them to draw more cur-\nrent when a change of the injection signal phase is made. This\neffect may also occur just because the circumferential electric\nfield is not changing linearly with angle near to the position of\nthe spoke. Asymmetry of the switching response is likely to be\na combination of this factor and the availability of charge.\nOne might suppose that the switching time can be estimated\nfrom the change in the anode current. The switching time\nshould be given by the phase shift divided by the shift of the\nangular frequency, i.e.,\ntswitch =\n\u2206\u03c6\n\u2206\u03c9\n.\nThe frequency shift can be determined from the change in\nthe anode current using constant temperature pushing curves.\n(These curves are steeper than those measured when the an-\node temperature is allowed to increase as the anode current\nincreases.) From [4], the frequency shift for a change in anode\ncurrent from 300 to 200 mA is 2 MHz; hence, for the case where\nthe anode current changes by this amount and the phase shift is\n90\u25e6 (e.g., the case of Figs. 7 and 8), then\ntswitch =\n\u03c0\n2\n\u00d7 1\n2\u03c0 \u00d7 2\u00d7 106 = 125 ns.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

At first sight,\nestimation of the switching time as given above does not\nseem to work. The discrepancy occurs because the constant\ntemperature pushing curves in [4] were determined for a high\nheater power of about 43 W. In the next section, it will be seen\nthat the pushing curves for low heater powers at low anode\ncurrents are much steeper, and it turns out that the estimation\nis still reasonable.\nAnode current variations also become quite small for high\nanode currents at intermediate heater powers as illustrated in\nFigs. 12 and 13. For the case of Fig. 13, the current changes\nby about 30 mA; hence, one estimates the switching time to be\nabout 400 ns in approximate agreement with the data.\nFig. 13. As Fig. 12 except for average current = 363 mA, frequency =\n2.4518 GHz.\nVI. PUSHING CURVES AS A FUNCTION OF HEATER POWER\nAn interesting feature observed when making the measure-\nments for Fig. 6 (see caption) is that as the heater power is\nincreased from 8 to 43 W, the current initially decreases before\nincreasing again. For the magnetron under investigation, it\nbecame apparent that its properties changed abruptly at a heater\ncurrent between 18 and 21 W. This feature was investigated\nby determining pushing curves as a function of heater power.\nFor a magnetron that is not injection locked, this is almost\nimpossible to do because a free-running magnetron will have a\nrange of heater powers and anode currents where the magnetron\nis so noisy that it is impossible to make meaningful frequency\nmeasurements. Indeed, for the magnetron under investigation, it\nwas not possible to control its frequency as a current-controlled\noscillator (and without injection) for heater powers between\n15 and 30 W. With injection and current control, it was possible\nto phase lock the magnetron for any heater power, and hence,\npushing curves could be obtained. A point to note with respect\nto the experimental detail and related to our PLL control is that\nthe injection level can be set too high for pushing curves to\nbe recorded. Indeed, it was necessary to reduce the injection\npower for lower anode currents. The reason for this is that,\nat high injection levels, the phase error between the reference\nand the magnetron is so small that the PLL stops adjusting\nthe current. This means that the current stays constant as the\nfrequency is adjusted until the lock jumps (i.e., phase lock by\nthe injection signal is lost for a few milliseconds or less while\nthe PLL control loop readjusts the current).\nFig. 14 shows the pushing curves obtained for our mag-\nnetron. They were obtained by simultaneously incrementing the\ninjection frequency and the PLL control frequency and measur-\ning the anode current at constant heater power. The anode tem-\nperature was also measured. The experiments were performed\nin such a way that the magnetron anode was heated at roughly\nthe same rate for each heater power. This was achieved by\nincrementing the frequency at the same rate for each curve (fil-\nament power constant) and then letting the anode cool back to\nthe same temperature before the data set for next filament power\nwas collected. Frequency data were then corrected for small\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library. Downloaded on July 27, 2009 at 06:16 from IEEE Xplore.

The frequency correction applied was 2 MHz for 100 \u25e6C\nas derived from constant temperature pushing curves [4].\nThe pushing curves of Fig. 14 show that at lower heater\npowers, there are two distinct modes of operation. The\ncrossover is at 20 W of heater power. Below 20 W, it is likely\nthat the subsynchronous zone is starved of electrons. The extent\nto which it forms depends crucially on secondary emission [9].\nAbove 20 W but at low anode currents, the subsynchronous\nzone grows until it is space charge limited. Noting that a high\nfrequency implies a lower effective capacitance for the anode\ncavities, then one infers from Fig. 14 that increasing the heater\npower for powers above 20 W and for anode currents above\n240 mA, one has an increased capacitance. Intuitively, one\nsupposes that as the heater power is increased in this regime,\nthen either the radius of the subsynchronous zone grows or the\ncharge density in the spokes grows (or both), both of which\nwould increase the capacitance.\nFor low anode currents, the subsynchronous zone or the\ncharge densities in the spokes grow to a limiting value.\nIt is reasonably clear that a magnetron being operated close\nto the transition heater power (in this case 20 W and whose\nfrequency is not injection locked) would become very noisy\nor would exhibit twining [28]. The transition point would of\ncourse vary with depletion of thorium in a thoriated cathode.\nThis type of noisy behavior of cooker magnetrons occurring\nat specific heater powers (filament voltages) is known and has\nbeen reported [11].\nVII. FSK SWITCHING\nAs well as PSK amplification by the magnetron, FSK am-\nplification by the magnetron is also possible. Fig. 15 shows\nthe output from the double-balanced mixer for an FKS input.\nThe PLL control frequency for the magnetron was 2.452 GHz,\nthe injection frequency was switched from 2.452 to 2.453 GHz\nFig. 15. Lower trace is the output from the double-balance mixer when the\nmagnetron injection signal is switched from 2.452 to 2.453 GHz at a rate of\n250 kb\/s (upper trace) and referenced to 2.451 GHz.\nat a rate of 250 kb\/s, and the reference frequency for the double-\nbalanced mixer was 2.451 GHz.\nThe transition between the two frequencies depends on the\nlevel of 100-Hz ripple at any instant and can take up to 1 \u00b5s. The\nfigure was sampled at a time when the transition was very short.\nVIII. CONCLUSION\nThe response of an injection-locked CW magnetron to\nchanges in phase and frequency has been studied as a function\nof heater power. The response characteristic and time constant\ndiffer from what one would expect from Adler\u2019s theory that\nrelies solely on a pulling effect; as well as being faster, it is\ndifferentially second order and asymmetric. These observations\ncan be explained if it is assumed that the locking mechanism\nalso depends on the same physical process, which leads to\nfrequency pushing.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank A.
