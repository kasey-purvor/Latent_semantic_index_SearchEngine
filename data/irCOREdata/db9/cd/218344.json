I \nargue that the development of the European Union has been \nfacilitated by the use of a legitimising device whereby policy \ndecisions at a European level are cast as beyond the scope of \nreasonable political disagreement and therefore distinct from \nthe conditions which make democracy a desirable political form \nat the national level. This rejection of the political \nsignificance of norm indeterminacy has led to a widely \ndiagnosed trend of \u201cdepoliticization\u201d in European politics. The \npaper examines how best to understand this trend, and explores \nhow an adapted account of \u201cenlightened localism\u201d might offer \nbetter ways of coping with indeterminate norms.\n1\n \n                                                 \n1\n I thank the issue editor for comments on an earlier draft. \nCompletion of the text was facilitated by a research grant from \nthe Alexander von Humboldt Stiftung. \n2 \n \n \nKey words \nEuropean Union, norm indeterminacy, depoliticization, \ncontestation, enlightened localism \n \nSince the early 1950s, a growing number of European countries \nhave committed themselves to dealing with certain political \nmatters collectively, on the grounds that there are political \ngoals which may best be achieved by some form of transnational \ncoordination. Such moves represent an exercise in re-orienting \npolitical decision-making to contexts beyond the nation-state, \nturning what were once principally domestic issues into those \nof foreign-political negotiation or, in many cases, a new mode \nof political practice that defies categorisation in such terms. \nThe range of issues placed in common has steadily increased \nover time, such that what could initially be called a Coal and \nSteel Community (1952-1967), an Economic Community (1957-67), \nand an Atomic Energy Community (1957-67) has come to be known \nas the European Union (EU) (as of 1993), with tasks touching on \ndefence policy and law-and-order as well as matters economic. \nAs these shifts indicate, multiple political objectives have \nunderlain these moves, with varying agendas pursued by the \nparties involved. Yet even amid such pluralism, two core \nobjectives are readily identifiable: peace and prosperity. The \ncentrality of these goals was evident already in the \ninternational treaties which inaugurated what came to be known \nas an \u201cintegration process,\u201d and they have since been used \n3 \n \nrepeatedly as justifications for further acts of \n\u201cEuropeanization.\u201d2 \nPeace and prosperity, and cognate terms such as collective \nsecurity and socio-economic development, are abstract concepts \nindicating normative orientations so broad that few would \nreject them. Yet they cannot tell us in what concrete forms \nthey might best be realised, nor do they indicate how policy-\nmaking might appropriately evolve over time in response to \nchanged circumstances. They are what, in discursive terms, one \nmay call essentially contested concepts (Connolly 1974) and, in \nsociological terms, indeterminate norms (Gregg 2003). Normative \nindeterminacy is present to some degree in all forms of social \nlife because the ends of social action are always in need of \ninterpretation, and people will diverge in the interpretations \nthey make. In many cases, the challenges this poses are easily \nmet: some norms are relatively determinate, such as the \ndirection indicated by an arrow, while others are so basic to \nsocial life that a convergence of practice is functionally \nnecessary (for example, conventions of pronunciation). But the \npossibility that norm indeterminacy may generate complications \n                                                 \n2\n See the Preamble to the ECSC Treaty: \u201cDesirous of assisting \nthrough the expansion of their basic production in raising the \nstandard of living and in furthering the works of peace.\u201d See \nalso the Preamble to the Treaty of Rome: \u201cResolved to ensure \nthe economic and social progress of their countries by common \naction to eliminate the barriers which divide Europe, \u2026 \nResolved by thus pooling their resources to preserve and \nstrengthen peace and liberty, and calling upon the other \npeoples of Europe who share their ideal to join in their \nefforts.\u201d Peace and prosperity have more recently been \nsupplemented with further normative goals such as human rights \nprotection. \n4 \n \nand disputes is persistently in the background. Indeed, \ndemocracy itself is arguably premised on this idea: democracy \nunderstood as a settled \u2013 though never static \u2013 set of \nprocedures within which political actors seek to garner wider \nsupport for one of the many possible interpretations of this or \nthat substantive norm, and to challenge temporarily achieved \nagreements on interpretation with reappraisal. Norm \nindeterminacy represents one important reason for rejecting \ndespotic rule. As Hans Kelsen noted, \u201cthe impossibility of \nclaiming \u2013 despite all subjective devotion or personal \nconviction \u2013 absolute validity for a political programme, a \npolitical ideal, imperatively forces a rejection also of \npolitical absolutism \u2013 be it the absolutism of a monarch, a \npriestly, noble or warrior caste, a class or an otherwise \nprivileged group\u201d (Kelsen 2000:108). \nThat conditions of indeterminacy are largely unavoidable, \nand that democracy is the political form peculiarly responsive \nto such conditions, hardly entails that these conditions are \nconsistently respected as such. One move in the interplay \nbetween power and ideology is not only to \u201cdecontest\u201d what was \ncontestable, but to obscure that such a step was ever taken. In \npolitical terms, coping with norm indeterminacy has, in post-\nWar European integration, often taken the form of masking it. \nAs I will show, this may be seen in a whole range of \ndevelopments discouraging and diminishing opportunities for \napplying public pressure to the decision-making process, a \ntrend sometimes identified by contemporary European scholars as \n5 \n \n\u201cdepoliticization.\u201d I examine how best to capture this trend, \npointing beyond institutional changes to some of the conditions \nwhich have enabled them. Drawing on recent theoretical work, I \nthen seek to indicate the kind of \u201cenlightened localist\u201d \napproach that offers an adequate response, highlighting the \nrole of practices of transnational contestation in forming an \nappropriate response to norm indeterminacy outside the nation-\nstate frame. \n \nThe Post-National as the Post-Political \n \nA distinctive feature of post-War European integration has been \nthe creation of institutions, with considerable powers of \npolicy formulation, whose office-holders are not intended to \nact directly as representatives of citizens or democratically \nelected governments. The most notable such institution is the \nEuropean Commission, composed of officials whose job \ndescriptions require them to be deaf to the political pressure \nof their national governments. Alongside it stands the European \nCourt of Justice, whose role as authoritative interpreter of \nCommunity law has made it a sometimes decisive influence on \npolicy-making. And then there are a growing range of functional \nagencies such as the European Central Bank and Europol \n(Flinders 2004). Such institutions are avowedly independent: \nthe European Central Bank proclaims what it calls its freedom \n6 \n \nfrom \u201cpolitical interference.\u201d3 Some are overseen closely by the \nCouncil, the European institution which houses representatives \nof member-state governments. But even this body enjoys \nconsiderable autonomy from national parliaments and from the \nEU\u201ds own representative assembly, the European Parliament, \nwhile its discussions and voting are largely hidden from public \nview. In short, the European level displays a substantial \narchitecture which is weakly democratic, indeed technocratic, \nin character. \nUnderlying the emergence of this regime, and sometimes \npresented as its rationale, is a distinction between national \nand Community interests. In standard accounts, the member-state \ngovernments defend the former while the independent European-\nlevel institutions defend the latter. Importantly, this \ndistinction has been overlaid with another, that between the \nmany and the one. Walter Hallstein, Commission President in the \n1960s and, as such, an important influence on early integration \nmoves, liked to say that \u201cthe Commission embodies the Community \ninterest,\u201d4 whereas the Council is the domain of \u201cparticularist \ninterests\u201d (Oppermann 1979:504-5). National interests (and the \nsub-national interests which compete to define them) are \ntreated as plural, whereas the Community interest is regarded \nas unitary and as susceptible to articulation by a corporate \n                                                 \n3\n See the ECB\u201ds own gloss on \u201ccentral bank independence\u201d at \nwww.ecb.int\/home\/glossary\/html\/act1c.en.html. \n4\n Emphasis added.  \n7 \n \ninstitutional actor.\n5\n In its own understanding, and in that of \nfounding figures such as Jean Monnet, the role of the \nCommission backed by the Court of Justice has been to identify \nand safeguard this wider interest and thus overcome the \ntendency of national interests to collide (Monnet 1963:206). By \ngiving the Commission (not the Council, nor the Parliament) the \nsole right to make legislative proposals for the Community, \npolicy initiation at a European level was deliberately \nseparated from member-state control, lest one or several of \nthem capture the policy-making agenda and deploy it for \nnarrower interests. The \u201cCommunity Method,\u201d as this arrangement \ncame to be known, was premised on the idea that the Community \nauthorities at the top of the pyramid were peculiarly far-\nsighted for the purposes of \u201cmaking\u201d Europe -- that they \nuniquely could, in Monnet\u2019s phrase, take the \u201cgeneral view\u201d and \nreveal the underlying commonality of interest which blinkered \npoliticians overlooked (Duch\u00eane 1994:366-7; Burgess \n2000:33ff.).\n6\n \nMoreover, many of those favourably disposed to the \nintegration process assumed, quite explicitly in the early \n                                                 \n5\n Anticipating what would become the EU\u201ds motto, Hallstein \nsuggested: \u201cif federation is unity in diversity, the Commission \nrepresents the unity and the Council the diversity\u201d (Oppermann \n1979:510).  \n6\n The need for a Community-level parliamentary assembly was \nacknowledged but its role was conceived more as a post-hoc \nscrutiniser than as an initiator. It was also intended to \nconstrain the Council more than the Commission. For Hallstein \non the Parliament, see Oppermann (1979:493). Note that Monnet\u2019s \noriginal vision had been more technocratic still, with a \nstronger High Authority (the proto-Commission) and a weaker \nrole for national governments (Duch\u00eane 1994:210ff.). \n8 \n \ndecades of integration, that an increasing number of policy-\nareas would need to be given over to decision-making at a \nEuropean level, the only level at which certain technical \nchallenges and interdependencies could be addressed. In \npressing for greater Commission powers, Hallstein spoke of \n\u201csimply following the command of political logic\u201d (Oppermann \n1979:491) and developed a theory of \u201cmaterial logic\u201d \n(Sachlogik) which cast the integration process in quite \ndeterminist terms. His views were by no means idiosyncratic but \nrather in tune with contemporary scholarly efforts to theorise \nthe process along functionalist lines (White 2003; Gilbert \n2008). \nFrom the outset then, important individuals in positions \nof power sought to shape European integration in terms of a \ndualism: national interests, overseen by democratic \ninstitutions as inherited from the immediate post-War period, \nand the Community interest, overseen by the obliquely \ndemocratic, perhaps even non-democratic, \u201cpost-national\u201d \ninstitutions of the emerging transnational architecture. \nStepping back, one might identify here a continuation of an \nolder theme in modern European thought, whereby the European is \ncast as the universal and transcendental in contrast to the \nprovincial and insular world of the national or local. The idea \nof \u201cEurope\u201d has this role in more than one system of beliefs, \nwhether the nineteenth-century reading of Enlightenment ideals \nof reason, civilisation, and cosmopolitan law or the Christian \nhumanist tradition embodied by post-War Catholic statesmen such \n9 \n \nas Adenauer.\n7\n There was, in the emerging institutional structure \nof what would become the EU, more than a hint of the European \n(or \u201csupranational\u201d) as the rational- or moral-universal, as a \nsphere decoupled from the conditions of reasonable \ndisagreement, in which the lead role in policy-formulation \nbelonged in the hands not of partisan politicians but in those \nof supposedly neutral experts. (No doubt the fear was in part \nthat, had policies not been presented as unambiguous goods or \nfunctional imperatives leaving little scope for debate, \nquestions might have been raised about the desirability of \nregional integration more generally.) By contrast, those who \nsought to promote the Community cause were liable to treat the \n\u201cnational\u201d as the domain of particularism in its distasteful \nguise: not so much the enlightened local as the parochial \nlocal. Visions for Europe different from those of the \nCommission were prone to be regarded not as plausible \nalternative perspectives on the \u201cCommunity interest\u201d but as \nbase, even irrational, nationalist sentiment.\n8\n In the dominant \n                                                 \n7\n See, e.g., Adenauer (1956:47-9) on the promise of European \nintegration as a means to preserve for mankind the cultural \nachievements of the Christian tradition. For a more general \nsense of moral duty informing Adenauer\u2019s and Monnet\u2019s plans for \nEurope, see Duch\u00eane (1994:207). \n8\n Cf. Loth (1993:408) on Hallstein at the time of the \nCommission\u201ds 1965 confrontation with de Gaulle\u2019s France: \u201cPour \nlui comme pour la plupart des Allemands de l\u2019\u00e9poque, de Gaulle \nn\u2019\u00e9tait qu\u2019un d\u00e9fenseur born\u00e9 des int\u00e9r\u00eats nationaux. Il \nignorait la dimension europ\u00e9ene des prises de position de ce \ndernier et il ne voyait aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat dans les r\u00e9flexions \nstrat\u00e9giques qui rendaient l\u2019autonomie de la Communaut\u00e9 dans le \ndomaine de la politique de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 aussi urgent dans la \nconception de de Gaulle.\u201d Hallstein had little doubt that \nreason and logic were on the side of the Commission and its \nvision of integration, announcing in the midst of the 1965 \n10 \n \nline of thinking, they represented precisely what the Community \nsought to leave behind: the divisions of war-time Europe. \nToday the Union that has emerged from these sixty years of \nintegration is commonly described as weakly politicised or even \nde-politicised (Hix 2008; Mair 2005; Schmidt 2006). \nParliamentary checks have been strengthened over time but the \nessential character of the EU is little changed.\n9\n The Commission \ncontinues to present itself as \u201cthe voice of the common \nEuropean interest\u201d (Barroso 2007) and the EU\u2019s decision-making \nprocedures still bear traces of this thought. Adopting the term \n\u201cdepoliticization\u201d sets this idea in the context of wider \ntrends in post-War European democracy towards technocratic and \njuridified forms of government, sometimes termed \u201cdistributed \npublic governance\u201d in which managerial control is shifted to \nnon-majoritarian institutions, the role of elected politicians \nin policy-design is reduced and the political \u2013 that is, \ncontestable \u2013 character of decision-making is set \u201cat one \nremove\u201d (Burnham 2001; Mair 2005; Flinders 2004). As a term, \n\u201cgovernance\u201d implies decision-making oriented to expertise, \nconsensus and efficiency (Tsakatika 2007), and its ready usage \nby EU actors implies a willingness to normalise these \ndevelopments (European Commission 2001). While an important \n                                                                                                                                            \nstandoff: \u201cNo crisis can change the outcome, because in the \nlong run reason is stronger than any error: and so the future \nstill belongs to us\u201d (Hallstein 1965:13). \n9\n These checks consist mostly of rarely used powers (for \nexample, to express no confidence in the Commission) or \nreactive powers of amendment and approval (stronger in some \npolicy-fields than others). This set-up encourages Members of \nthe European Parliament to seek strength in unity, further \ndiminishing the meaningfulness of their political differences. \n11 \n \nscholarly tradition argues that member-state governments \ncontinue to be the key decision-makers in the EU set-up, the \nCouncil remains an opaque institution whose decision-making is \nweakly susceptible to monitoring by national publics: when \nnational representatives gather in Brussels they, too, seem to \nacquire a capacity to identify the unique Community interest \nand so dispense with the need for political scrutiny. In its \ndealings with countries wishing to join it, the EU issues \ndetailed entry conditions rationalised in the universal terms \nof \u201cstandards\u201d and \u201cbest practice,\u201d evading dialog and debate \nin which these countries might influence the evaluative \ncriteria deemed appropriate to them (Zielonka 2006:57ff.). \nThis regime structure is not without supporters. Some \nscholars treat conventional democratic standards as irrelevant \nto what they consider to be essentially a series of interstate \nagreements between national governments (Moravcsik 2002). \nAlternatively, in one line of democratic theorising, \ninstitutional shifts of this kind are appealing insofar as they \ncontribute to the efficiency or rationality of government, \navoiding the misguided or internally-contradictory outcomes \nthat can follow decision-making by voting (Pettit 2001; Pettit \n2004). At the same time, such developments tend to downplay the \nsignificance of values other than efficiency, such as \naccountability, transparency, and popular involvement in \ndecision-making. Moreover, to suppose that technocratic forms \nof policy-making at a European level can be endorsed while \npreserving vital democratic politics at the national level \n12 \n \nseems doubtful, inasmuch as the one often sets the terms for \nthe other. In a phrase \u201csmacking, characteristically, of the \ncounting-house rather than the forum\u201d (Anderson 2007:15), \nobservers have been speaking for some time of a \u201cdemocratic \ndeficit\u201d in Europe, and while some scholars are willing to \noffer some creative accounting, this deficit appears to be \nrooted in political fundamentals. To explore it more fully \nrequires looking beyond matters of institutional design and \nbeyond relocations of decision-making authority. It requires \nlooking to the commitments these express and the reasons why \nthey have proved tenable. \n \nA Supporting Consensus? The Difficult Underpinnings of \nDepoliticised Institutions \n \nObservers note that while transfers of decision-making \nauthority may somewhat diminish national leaders\u201d hands-on \ncontrol, politicians continue to set the terms of transfer and \ngenerally retain crucial powers (Buller and Flinders 2006). If \ntheir subsequent power is often underestimated, this seems less \nbecause of the shifts themselves and more because of the \nwillingness of politicians to emphasise the limits to their \ncapacities. In turn, this willingness may indicate that such \nconstraints are found to be acceptable, perhaps even desirable. \nTo better understand depoliticization is therefore to answer \nthe question: under what conditions does the relocation of \ndecision-making authority achieve outward acceptability? \n13 \n \nOne might think that because such transfers are largely \ninconsistent with the expression of political conflicts, they \nmust reflect a consensus on the means and ends of policy-making \n\u2013 at least in those policy areas thus administered. As Hay \ncorrectly notes, one of the characteristic features of politics \nin any recognisable conception is that it occurs in situations \nof choice. Where there are no choices to be made, either \nbecause there is only one viable or desirable line of action, \nor because human agency cannot be exercised, politics is not in \nplay (Hay 2007). Depoliticization might then be regarded as the \nwithering away of meaningful choices and the substantive \npolitical disagreements they give rise to. Indeed this is one \nof the rationales sometimes given for the involvement of non-\nmajoritarian institutions in the formulation of EU policy. \nWhile diagnoses of the obsolescence of ideas-based conflict \nhave been a more general trope of the post-Cold War era, they \nhave a natural home in EU discourse, given older notions of the \nCommunity interest. Some observers regard certain policy-areas \nas unsuitable to political contestation because they entail \npurely regulatory policy-making which, tending toward Pareto \noptimality, benefits some or all citizens while disadvantaging \nfew or none (Scharpf 1999; Majone 1998). For example, some \nobservers find the transfer to the European Central Bank of \nmanagerial competences in the monetary domain justifiable on \nthe basis of a putative consensus on monetarism (as the best \nmeans to achieve economic stability) and on GDP growth and low \ninflation (as the principal indicators of stability). \n14 \n \nIdeological convergence of this sort then implies that \ndecision-making may be reduced to problem-solving mechanisms of \na technocratic kind, with major political choices \u2013 for \nexample, concerning levels of government spending \u2013 rendered \nobsolete or strongly circumscribed (hence the eurozone\u2019s \nStability Pact, designed to limit member-states\u2019 annual budget \ndeficit to 3% or less of GDP). More broadly, policy-makers may \nbe guided only by what they consider to be in citizens\u201d \ninterests rather than \u2013 as in the tradition of national \nparliamentary democracy \u2013 what demonstrably accords with their \nwill (Scharpf 1999:11ff.). \nBut are certain policies so fundamentally incontestable \nthat they may be decided at a transnational level with limited \nrecourse to public debate? Have the policies instituted at a \nEuropean level enjoyed universal esteem as the best means to \nrealise shared goals of peace and prosperity? Such a \npossibility seems remote in light of norm indeterminacy. Norms \nsuch as peace and prosperity are likely to be subject to \nconsiderable diversity of interpretation. Policies that might \nrealize such endpoints are underdetermined by the concepts \nthemselves: they are in need of elucidation, something that can \nbe done in multiple ways (Gregg 2003:19, 22, 32). Moreover, \ndifferent interpretations differently weigh the sacrifices \nacceptable to the pursuit of these endpoints. Norm \ninterpretation is likely to be especially diverse in settings \noutside the nation-state frame, where a particularly wide range \nof cultural repertoires are deployed (Wiener 2008). Even if one \n15 \n \nsupposes one interpretation superior to all others, \nepistemological barriers which prevent the universal \ndemonstration of that superiority are likely to remain. The \nfact that considerable changes of policy orientation across \ntime are evident even within the Commission alone reminds us of \nthis pluralist tendency: the emphasis on market-led growth \ncharacteristic of the institution\u2019s early phase was interrupted \nin the 1980s and 1990s by the Delors Commission\u2019s emphasis on \n\u201csocial\u201d policies (even as this shift in orientation was hardly \nsubject to public debate). A more recent shift has \nresubordinated social policies to the market, now redescribed \nas adaptations to the pressures of global competition (Bernhard \n2009). Such variation in interpretation \u2013 variation that can \nhardly be attributed merely to contextual changes - suggests \nthat the unthinkability of political alternatives is \ninsufficient to explain the technocratic trajectory of the \nCommunity\u2019s development. In normative terms, such variation \ndoes not support the idea that legitimate decision-making \ncapacities may be placed beyond democratic control at the \nEuropean level and that the European sphere may be cast as a \npost-political one (Hix and Follesdal 2006). \nMore likely than deep consensus on the policies \nsupranationally administered is the appearance of consensus, as \nwell as the appearance that political choice no longer exists, \neven as reasonable dissenting perspectives are available. This \noutcome may follow from the orchestrated efforts of certain \npowerful political actors to marginalise such perspectives, on \n16 \n \ngrounds of perceived interest, or because of a more diffuse \nideological climate that casts substantive disagreement as \nsomething unreasonable or dangerous, thus encouraging its \nprivatization. Indeed, the two explanations may coalesce as \nefforts are made to solidify the authority of a certain set of \nideas, and as that authority in turn influences perceptions of \ninterest. In either case, one sees \u201cdepoliticization\u201d if one \njudges dissenting perspectives (significant if voiced by many \nor if they raise important objections) as insufficiently \narticulated and contested in public debate. Institutional \ndepoliticization then marks a \u201csuperficial\u201d consensus that \nfails to reflect wider currents in society as a whole. This \nperspective fits well with the elite-driven process of European \nintegration, and with the fear that open disagreements might \nundermine its appeal. \nSuch consensus is not without cost. Indeed, its political \nconsequences are predictably negative, regardless of whether \none approves of the policies it promotes. Political campaigning \nwill start to lose its programmatic aspect as substantive \npolitical differences cease to be articulated. Citizens will \nthen be deprived of the opportunity to acquaint themselves with \npolitical alternatives and to exert choice and develop \nconfidence in their choices. A kind of fatalism will likely \nensue, undermining democratic practices and leaving consensuses \nand depoliticised forms of decision-making to persist \nundisturbed. Such problems would only be exacerbated when the \nideas forming the basis of consensus themselves discourage \n17 \n \ncollective forms of political agency. A tendency to cast \ncitizens in individualistic terms, for example as consumers, is \nevident in much EU discourse as it is in contemporary political \ndiscourse more widely, and is likely to reinforce feelings of \npowerlessness before wider socio-economic forces. The tendency \nto diminish popular expectations of what politics may achieve \npoints to what \u201cdepoliticization\u201d may really mean. For a true \npolitical community is surely one in which the citizenry holds \nfirmly to the basic conviction that political engagement is \nmeaningful, whatever the limitations of existing structures. \nThis residual conviction needs to persist despite the \nimperfections of a given political regime; only then is popular \ndisenchantment toward political institutions likely to take the \nform of critique rather than disinterest or cynicism. Only then \nare citizens likely to interrogate the ideological consensuses \nwhich more powerful groups in society claim to have identified, \nand to challenge the insulation of decision-making from \ndemocratic mechanisms. \nRecent EU history has revealed as merely cosmetic any \nwould-be political consensus on the policies administered by \nthe EU. Though challenged in the past by singular statesman \nsuch as de Gaulle, it has now been punctured more than once by \nwider publics, as with the 2005 French and Dutch rejections of \nthe proposed, highly policy-specific Constitution. While some \ndismiss these results as a return to \u201cnationalism\u201d (if not to \n\u201cpopulism\u201d), leading back to the very dualisms described above, \nundeniable is that a substantial number of votes cast in these \n18 \n \nreferenda reject policies pursued over the course of European \nintegration. These votes are reactions against the attempt to \nsuppress indeterminacy in matters of how best to pursue basic \npolitical goals of peace and prosperity. Whether these \nexpressions of discontent signal a new \u201cpoliticisation\u201d of the \nEU space is a different matter (and they probably do not). \nReferenda provide opportunities for the expression of dissent \nbut limited opportunities for the articulation of alternative \nprogrammes, and even fewer opportunities for their maintenance \nand development over time. Outbursts of disapproval would need \nto be followed by a sustained political focus if they are to \ntranslate into meaningful and constructive opposition, \notherwise the dissatisfaction they express might assume \ndestructive forms. Even if talk of \u201cpoliticisation\u201d is \npremature, the idea of a supporting consensus is discredited. \nI would summarize my points so far as follows. A principal \ncurrent of regional integration in Europe has involved side-\nstepping the indeterminacy at the core of political \nnormativity. The side-stepping has been both institutional and \nrhetorical. Until recently, integration has been widely \npresented and justified to European populations as a necessary \nfunctional response to certain technical challenges. Attention \nto normative concerns \u2013 how best to interpret a rather open set \nof basic goals and to justify integration in terms of such \ngoals \u2013 has been suppressed in favour of an emphasis on \ntechnical or conventional concerns (Gregg 2003:19-20). Matters \nof potential normative disagreement have been treated as the \n19 \n \npreserve of the national sphere whereas European-level \ndecision-making has been presented as going beyond the \nparochialism of that sphere. Its alternative has been \nenvisioned not in terms of an enlightened localism that \nrecognises the contestability of political choices but rather \nas a kind of universalism founded on a technocratic idea of the \n\u201cCommunity interest\u201d that admits little possibility of \nreasonable political dissent. The conditions that would \nlegitimise this technocratic idea \u2013 deep consensus \u2013 seem quite \nimplausible. On grounds of both democracy and political \nprudence, this then seems a poor way of coping with \nindeterminacy. \n \nEnlightened Localism in the EU \n \nThe challenge is to imagine ways of recasting the European \nsphere so as to avoid positing it as a consensual, post-\npolitical space in which decision-making authority is beyond \nthe realm of democratic control. And the challenge is to do \nthis without simply valorising the local, for instance by \nrenouncing the idea of a European polity and calling for a \nreturn to the European nation-state system. The material \nachievements and further potential of regional integration are \nreal enough, even if hobbled by a lack of debate over political \nalternatives. Rather than abandoning the pursuit of peace and \nprosperity at a regional level, we might seek to re-establish \nit on a different footing. \n20 \n \nGregg\u2019s project of developing a theory of enlightened \nlocalism, as a politics \u201covershooting any particular worldview \nwithout positing some universal one\u201d (Gregg 2003:8), resonates \nwith the challenge described. His concern to conceptualise a \npolitics characterised by cooperation and compromise between \nthose who at the end of the day continue to disagree, rather \nthan positing political consensus or some kind of \u201cthick \nnormativity\u201d as the basis for social integration, is \nparticularly well attuned to the conditions of diversity found \nin the contemporary EU (Gregg 2002:747-8). As a set of \nsensitising ideas, it is richly suggestive and deserving of \ncloser attention, even as its application to the problematic \noutlined here needs care. \nThe account developed in Coping in Politics with \nIndeterminate Norms seems best suited to a landscape of well-\ndefined social groupings. Vital democratic life in Gregg\u2019s \nconception centres on groups able to articulate the distinctive \nexperiences shared by their members in ways that challenge, yet \nspeak to, the viewpoints of other similarly established \ngroupings. Indeed, the very ability to distinguish enlightened \nlocalism from particularism of less appealing kinds depends on \nthe presence of identifiable social groups or communities who \nboth embody the local and who \u201covershoot\u201d it by thinking beyond \ntheir own narrow interests and self-understandings. Gregg \nspeaks of \u201cinterest-based coalitions with specific political \ngoals\u201d; this notion invites open discussion of how interests \nthemselves might be indeterminate, and how the groups which \n21 \n \nform around interpretations of them are contingent. \nCorrespondingly, Gregg\u2019s notion of \u201cgroups based on shared \nidentities\u201d invites consideration of the nature of identity and \nits relationship to groupness (Gregg 2003:52-4). Yet when \ndeveloping the account he deploys examples \u2013 generally based on \nUS race relations \u2013 where these groups and their interests \npresent themselves, perhaps to an unusual degree, as self-\nevident. \u201cRacial equality,\u201d a norm he returns to frequently, is \none which refers exactly to groups of this well-formed kind. \nSensitive as the author is to the dangers of positing \nhomogeneous groups \u2013 the problem of overlooking internal \ndisagreements and power relations within them, and of \nneglecting each individual\u2019s multiple lines of identification \n(Gregg 2003:88) \u2013 his account nonetheless takes readily \nidentifiable groups as its point of departure (as well as a \nsettled political arena in which they act). Because his \nconception of \u201cenlightened\u201d is closely linked to perspectives \nwhich extend beyond such groups, the existence of well-bounded \nentities which encapsulate the initial localism must be \nassumed. \nAt first glance it is unclear what the analogues of such \ngroups might be in the transnational European context, and thus \nto what extent the theory of enlightened localism might be \napplicable. One of the salient aspects of this context, due in \nparticular to the processes of boundary change entailed by \nEuropean integration, is that not only regulative moral and \nlegal norms are significantly indeterminate. Indeterminacy \n22 \n \nextends also to what one might call the constitutive norms of \nthe subjects of political claims. While one might be tempted to \nsee the member-states of the Union as \u201ccarriers of the local,\u201d \nthis analogy is unlikely given the degree to which they no \nlonger resemble nation-states each characterised by a \nhomogeneous way of life. The member-states are diverse within \nthemselves as well as in the aggregate and thus constitute the \nconditions which might prompt a theory of enlightened localism \nin the first place. At the same time, however, they can hardly \nbe considered discrete units composed of well-bounded social \ngroups, in part because the processes of integration render \ngroups increasingly amorphous, with some straddling national \nboundaries. One thinks for instance of the migrant worker \ncommunities from Eastern Europe that emerged in Western member-\nstates following the 2004 enlargement of the Union (Polish \ncommunities in Britain, for example). These communities are \nfluid in their composition, possibly transient in existence, \nand open up new social cleavages when members return to their \ncountry of origin after a period of wage-earning abroad. Nor \ncan one speak confidently of an emerging pan-European space \nmade up of transnational social groupings and classes, at least \nin the short term (Medrano 2009). Further, those most in need \nof representatives who can articulate political claims on their \nbehalf (and of \u201cenlightened recognition\u201d by others), such as \nmigrants, are those whose lives are most fluid, based on \npatterns of exit and the struggle to find voice. This presents \n23 \n \na problem of representation \u2013 by whom, and of what \u2013 that \ncannot be settled by appeal to established social groupings. \nSuch reservations notwithstanding, I propose an account of \nenlightened localism adapted to the EU context. Rather than \nmapping political perspectives onto existing social groupings \ndefined by reference to a secondary principle (such as race, \nethnicity, or class) and regarding them as particularist in \nthis sense, localism might be identified in the positions \nadopted in political conflict. Political contestation involves \nthe competitive promotion and clash of normative \ninterpretations of the public good, with protagonists couching \ntheir programmes in terms of widely endorsed political goals \n(prominently: peace and prosperity). All such interpretations \nare \u201clocal\u201d in the sense that they are contestable, as so \nevident in the context of political struggle. What would allow \nsome interpretations to be regarded as \u201clocally enlightened\u201d is \ntheir success in an expanded political debate. Rather than \nappealing only to a nation-based constituency or a chauvinistic \nsub-national one, such views would be framed so as to engender \nthe support of citizens dispersed across multiple EU member-\nstates \u2013 a transnational constituency, even if persistently \nmarked by some degree of dissent. Political demands unable to \nmuster this wider constituency of support need not be dismissed \noutright. After all, there may be certain desirable claims \nwhich are best articulated in geographically localist terms, \nand which therefore would need to be pursued in national or \nsubnational arenas. But those that did gain acceptance in a \n24 \n \ndebate played out at a European level would have a reasonable \nclaim (naturally never beyond dispute) to be articulating a \nwider public good and to deserve recognition as \u201cenlightened\u201d.10 \nIn this way the idea of enlightened localism may be re-embedded \nin political debate, such that it is a designation made not by \nthe scholar in advance of such debate but one generated by the \noutcome of political contestation. As an approach, enlightened \nlocalism promises a way to circumvent the dualism that has too \nlong characterised the commonsense of European integration: \nthat of the national as parochial and the European as \nuniversal. In its place one would have the outcome of \ntransnational contestation as the enlightened local. \nSo understood, enlightened localism offers the enticing \nprospect of political goals pursued democratically in the face \nof norm indeterminacy.\n11\n It offers an image of political \n                                                 \n10\n This quality should be understood relatively: depending on \nthe issue involved, such a designation may be appropriate \nalso in the nation-state context, or alternatively may demand \ncontexts wider than the European. \n11\n  This reading of enlightened localism is also compatible with \nlocalism in another of the senses envisaged by Gregg: the \nspatial one having to do with the location of decision-making \nauthority. For political contestation at the European level may \nbe (perhaps should be) more about the setting of ultimate \nobjectives of policy-making than deciding details of its \nexecution. The latter may properly draw on local knowledge \nfound close to the many sites where legislation is \nadministered, yet without generating \u201cparochial\u201d effects so \nlong as there is a wider framework by which to assess the \nresults of these practices. The relationship between different \nlevels of authority is thus contractual or \u201chorizontal\u201d rather \nthan hierarchical and centralised (cf. Gregg 2003:15). \nScholarship on the EU includes attempts to conceive such a \nsystem, drawing on the idea of \u201cdemocratic experimentalism\u201d \n(Gerstenberg and Sabel 2002; Sabel and Zeitlin 2007). Given \ntheir common origin in pragmatist philosophy, these attempts \nresonate well with notions of enlightened localism. While \n25 \n \ncommunity as developing through adversarialism, much in the \ntradition of conflict theorists such as Georg Simmel (Simmel \n1904). Political contestation of this kind is identified by \nsome scholars as already an emerging reality in the European \nParliament, one that might be accelerated with modest \ninstitutional changes such as the direct election of the \nCommission President (Hix 2008). Certainly enlightened localism \nwould have a logical home in the Parliament, inasmuch as MEPs \nface the task of formulating positions sufficiently \u201clocal\u201d as \nto appeal to their constituents at home while at the same time \nbeing sufficiently \u201cenlightened\u201d as to allow coalitions at a \ntransnational level. Yet the prospect of political demands \nbeing pursued at a transnational level still presupposes that \ncitizens themselves are committed to such pursuit. Again, such \nan assumption may be plausible for certain marginalised, self-\nconscious social groups with a clear sense of the injustices \nthey face and of the concrete changes they seek \u2013 perhaps the \nkind Gregg focuses on \u2013 but such commitment is more difficult \nto assume elsewhere. Not least because of the consensus-\ntendencies of EU politics, political engagement among citizens \nis in question. Voting levels in the 2009 European \n                                                                                                                                            \ndemocratic experimentalism is, like deliberative approaches \nmore generally, generally understood as a departure from the \ncontestatory politics characteristic of representative \ndemocracy, the practices it entails \u2013 communication and \nlearning across multiple sites of political action \u2013 is fully \nconsistent with contestatory politics in compound or federal \npolitical structures. Indeed, such an approach seems suited to \npreventing the slide into fragmented and disjointed politics \u2013 \nor into parochialism, in the terminology of \u201cenlightened \nlocalism\u201d \u2013 that may follow decentralisation of decision-making \n(though cf. B\u00fcchs [2008]). \n26 \n \nParliamentary elections were at a historical low (43%) and many \nof those who did vote chose to support anti-system parties \noffering little in the way of a positive programme. With the \nParliament weakly connected to wider publics, it is likely to \ndepend for its animation on outside actors for relevance and \nvitality. \nOne such instance in recent European politics is the \nmobilisation against the Commission\u2019s Draft Services Directive \n(the so-called Bolkestein Directive) that began in 2004 and \nsuccessfully broke through an initially favourable consensus in \nthe Council and Parliament (Crespy 2009). Led by coalitions of \nnational-level political parties, backed by social movements \nand trade unions, and ultimately finding voice in the \nParliament itself, opposition to the proposals and the \npromotion of alternatives generated significant citizen \nengagement. The episode remains a rare one and subsequent \nfailures of leadership (notably on the French Left) prevented \nits consolidation as a political movement. Nonetheless it shows \nwhat can still be achieved under the existing institutional \nregime and in the face of political scepticism. It is to \nfurther such campaigns, and to transnationally-coordinated \npolitical programmes at the national level which build on them, \nthat one would need to look for a politicisation of the EU \nspace and more generally for the emergence of a political bond \namong EU citizens (White, in press). \n \nConclusion \n27 \n \n \nRegional integration in Europe presents a challenge to the \npolitical methods modern states have employed for coping with \nnorm indeterminacy. In place of institutional structures which \nare professedly democratic, Europe\u2019s leaders have given a \nleading entrepreneurial role to non-elected institutions whose \nindependence from political control has frequently been \nvalorised. If the national world is then cast as the place of \npartisan and parochial disagreement, the supranational sphere \nassumes opposite connotations as a site of determinate norms, \nwhere interests and policy-orientations are beyond reasonable \ncontestation and which may therefore be left to the \ninterpretation of experts and to weakly accountable elites. \nWhile this way of coping with the uncertainties of \ninternational politics was arguably an appropriate response in \nthe immediate post-War context, indeed one deserving some \ncredit for its role in advancing continental security and \neconomic development, ultimately it has weakened democratic \npractices at the national level without adequately generating \nnew ones at the European level. Such a regime would be \njustified only if the conditions of norm indeterminacy had been \nerased: if there were a strong and readily identifiable \nconsensus on the policies administered supranationally. Such a \nconsensus seems hard to infer, however, given political dissent \nin recent years as well as cross-temporal variations in belief \nconcerning how the basic goals of peace and prosperity should \nbe achieved. \n28 \n \nEncompassing a broad family of responses to norm \nindeterminacy, enlightened localism offers certain guidance \nhere, pointing up the inadequacy of casting supranational \ndecision-making as a mainly technocratic process and indicating \nwhy certain related trends of depoliticization are problematic. \nIt captures the merits of a politics able to transcend the \nnation-state container while remaining faithful to the \ncontestability of claims to articulate the transnational good. \nIn a globalising world characterised by increasing transborder \nflows and transnational attempts to respond to such flows, such \nthinking will have application beyond the European context. At \nthe same time, any such account must acknowledge the role of \npolitical conflict and debate in giving definition to what is \n\u201clocal\u201d and to what is \u201cenlightened local.\u201d The kind of \nenlightened localism needed in today\u2019s Europe is arguably one \ncentred on the pursuit of certain political projects on a \ntransnational scale. Enlightened localist standpoints would be \nthose that could claim transnational support when pitched in \nthis wider adversarial struggle. To be sure, such a scenario is \nchallenged by a crucial aspect of contemporary depoliticization \n\u2013 weakening public conviction in possibilities for exercising \npolitical agency. But it also offers the promise of countering \ntrends towards disaffection and fatalism, reasserting the \ncontestability of how political norms are interpreted and \napplied, and giving reminder of why seeking to influence this \nprocess is worthwhile. \n \n29 \n \nReferences \n \nAdenauer, Konrad. 1956.
