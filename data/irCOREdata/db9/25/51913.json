INTRODUCTION \nThe emergence of interactive, web-based software tools \nhas led to a generation of people who are occupied, even \npre-occupied, with creating a digital archive of their lives. \nWhether by recording and sharing daily events or storing \nmultimedia artifacts, today\u2019s digital natives are becoming \ndigital curators of their own life experiences.  \n \nThe digital divide remains evident in the UK due to \nsocio-economic and geographical barriers [1]. Therefore, it \nshould not be taken for granted that all students entering \nhigher education are digital natives, having an \u201calways on\u201d \nconnection to the Internet and virtual personas. \n \nHowever, many young adults do have varying levels of \nICT and online skills, knowledge and experience. These are \ngained in a variety of settings including the home, school \nand work. \n \nSeventy-three percent of UK households now have \nInternet access, and an increasing-range of online activities \nare changing everyday living, communication, and driving \nsocial change. Social networking, shopping and watching \ntelevision on the Internet are all popular online activities [2]. \n \nEducation is also being affected by the connected, online \ndevelopments reported above. Some would say learning is \nbecoming a more social experience and is concerned with \nlearners forming networks with each other [3]. This view is \nsupported by Futurelab, who report that through the use of \ninteractive technologies known as social software, learners \ncan come together, build communities and share \ninformation [4]. In defining the term social software Shirky \nstates that \"we are still learning how to build and use the \nsoftware-defined conference tables and campfires we're \ngathering around\" [5]. Indeed, the effective use of this \ntechnology in teaching and learning requires that institutions \nadopt a student-centred approach to pedagogy. \n \nAs well as supporting individual activity, technology can \nbe used to facilitate collaborative learning and to monitor \nstudent progress in collaborative environments. Jermann et \nal reported on student use of on-line technologies in \nproviding repository and documentation facilities [6]. Wang \nreports on the use of several tools (Drop.io, Google Groups, \nPBworks, and Facebook Group) to encourage and support \ncollaborative working. He found that these tools added \npotential for monitoring the collaborative learning process \nbut concluded that this was most effectively done alongside \ntraditional face-to-face approaches [7]. \n \nAuthors have identified learner preference in the use of \nweb-hosted material [8] [9]. Research has shown that \nlearner preference for a particular on-line resource is \nessential if the learner is to benefit from its use [10]. A \nsurvey of students of the Spanish language found that they \nwere guided by their learning preferences in their use of on-\nline content [11]. \n \nPolicy initiatives around employability, achievement, \npersonalisation and the skills agenda, coupled with \ninstitutional drivers including personal development \nplanning (PDP), mean this new approach is being made \npossible. Gray and Joyes also explain that the emergence of \npersonal development planning in higher education has led \nto the implementation of ePortfolios [12]. \n \nChang et al reflect on the effect that previous experience \nof portfolio usage might have when ePortfolios are \nintroduced. In a study that considers various models of \ntechnology acceptance Chang et al identify that traditional \npaper-based portfolios are prevalent in subjects such as art, \narchitecture and teacher training. They recommend bringing \nacceptance testing to the earliest possible phase in the \ndevelopment cycle in order to establish perceived values \nand thereby predict the users\u2019 attitudes regarding acceptance \nof ePortfolios [13]. \n \nRebbeck suggests, \u201cthe ePortfolio is the central and \ncommon point for the student learning experience... It is a \nreflection of the student as a person undergoing continuous \npersonal development, not just a store of evidence\u201d [14].  \n \nePortfolios can facilitate a student-centred and \npersonalised approach to learning in a connected world. \nHowever this raises the question of the extent to which \ntraditional learning theories still valid in technology-\nenhanced models of learning. A report by the Joint \nInformation Systems Committee, suggests that David \nKolb\u2019s experiential learning cycle can be adapted to provide \n\u201ccontinuous learning based around dialogue and \ncollaborative activity with others\u201d [15][16]. \n \nElectronic portfolios can serve many purposes and \naudiences. Indeed, they have been defined as both \u2018process\u2019 \nand \u2018product\u2019. For example, in the case of a presentation, or \nshowcase portfolio - the product is the portfolio, but for a \nworking portfolio \u2013 the process is the portfolio [17]. \n \nStudies [18] [19] [20] have shown that positive benefits \ncan be derived from the use of ePortfolios in education both \nas multimedia repositories and as tools to assist learning. \nII. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES \nThis paper forms part of a wider, ongoing project by the \nauthors looking at the effective use of ePortfolios in Higher \nEducation [21]. The aim of this stage of the research was to \nfocus on the skills and experiences of a group of students at \nentry to their programme and the effect on that group of \nintroducing the structured and formal use of ePortfolios. \n \nThe objectives were: \n\u2022 to establish the skills and experience of the cohort on \nentry to university; \n\u2022 to establish the current student perception of ePortfolio \ndevelopment in helping to manage their learning \n\u2022 to create an intervention whereby student experienced \ninitial workspace ePortfolio development; \n\u2022 to evaluate the practical ePortfolio creation sessions \nthrough the use of an online quantitative survey and \npractical ePortfolio creation sessions; \n\u2022 to seek relationships between skills on entry and the \noverall success of the ePortfolio development exercise. \nIII. METHODOLOGY \nA pragmatic, mixed-method approach was taken to gain \nan understanding of student experiences of using interactive \nWeb 2.0 tools, their perception of ePortfolios in learning, \nand initial experience of ePortfolio creation. Investigations \nconducted were practical in nature, but differed in design \nand approach.  \n \nResearch methods \nThe following methods were utilised: \n\u2022 an online, quantitative survey investigating prior \nknowledge and experience of online, interactive, \nWeb 2.0 tools, electronic storage of work, \nexperience and perception of ePortfolio creation; \n\u2022 analysis and interpretation of survey data; \n\u2022 observation to monitor levels of student \nengagement during ePortfolio workshops; \n\u2022 individual written responses to open-ended \nquestions from a smaller focus group of students, \ndetailing their individual experiences of ePortfolio \ncreation to provide additional, qualitative data. \n \nImplementation \n \nA new level one cohort of students following an \nundergraduate, technology-based programme was selected \nand asked to complete the online survey.  \n \nStudents were then introduced to the concept of \nePortfolios and how they could be used as a tool to manage \ntheir learning, before development began. The ePortfolios \nwere developed using Wordpress, a Web 2.0 personal \npublishing tool, during supervised workshop sessions. They \nwere tasked to create an ePortfolio, suitable for use as an \nonline repository for digital artefacts including text, images, \naudio and video. The intention was that the ePortfolio \nshould be developed for use across the various modules \nbeing studied and over time thereby building a story of their \nlearning experiences, achievements, and eventually \nbecoming a reflective learning tool. \nIV. FINDINGS \nA. Student survey investigating prior knowledge and \nexperience of online, interactive, Web 2.0 tools, \nelectronic storage of work, experience and perception of \nePortfolio creation. \nA total of 51 students responded to the survey. Findings \nwere as follows: \n\u2022 Gender: 88% male, 12% female. \n\u2022 Age: The majority of respondents belonged to the \n18-23 years age range. \n\u2022 Social networking: The majority of students \nreported having \u2018very good\u2019 knowledge and \nexperience of social networking tools such as \nFacebook. \n\u2022 Online tools used in learning: YouTube, Flickr \nand blogs were popular with the majority of \nstudents. \n\u2022 Wikis: The majority of students reported having  \n\u2018some\u2019 knowledge and experience. \n\u2022 Web services: The majority of students reported \nhaving \u2018good\u2019 knowledge and experience. \n\u2022 Tagging: The majority of students reported having \n\u2018good\u2019 knowledge and experience. \n\u2022 eLearning: The majority of students reported \nhaving higher levels of \u2018some knowledge and \nexperience. \n\u2022 eGovernment: The majority of students reported \nhaving \u2018no\u2019 knowledge and experience. \n\u2022 Electronic storage of work: The majority of \nstudents reported keeping copies of their work and \nCV\u2019s digitally.  \n\u2022 Storage medium: The majority of students \nindicated they were storing work on a PC. Mobile \ndevices were also a popular choice. \n\u2022 ePortfolio creation: The majority of students \nreported having no prior experience of ePortfolio \ndevelopment. \n\u2022 Perceived uses of an ePortfolio: Students \nindicated using an ePortfolio as an everyday \nrepository to access and store digital content would \nbe of benefit to them they also felt using an \nePortfolio to showcase learning and achievement \nwould also be a major benefit. The majority felt \nthey would continue to develop their portfolios \nafter graduation. \n \nB. ePortfolio workshop sessions \nThe student cohort participated in two supervised \nePortfolio development workshop sessions. Students were \nprovided with supporting, introductory notes and \ndocumentation on ePortfolio development. Findings and \nobservations were as follows: \n \n\u2022 Students were observed as being motivated, \nengaged and on task. \n\u2022 In their own time between sessions many students \nhad accessed and further developed their portfolio. \n\u2022 Personalisation of ePortfolios was found to be very \nimportant to students. Changes to page \nlayout\/colours\/fonts, theme changes, creation of \nadditional pages, menu structure to reflect content \nand page content were some of the ways in which \npersonalisation was achieved. \n\u2022 When asked what aspect they enjoyed the most \nabout creating their portfolios, students indicated \npersonalisation, timely expression of thoughts, \nseeing how their work has progressed and how \nmuch they\u2019ve learned, and being able to create an \nonline presence people would be interested in \nviewing. \n\u2022 All students successfully created an ePortfolio. \nWhilst some students felt Wordpress was intuitive \nand straightforward to use, some felt the \ntechnology was driving them - at least until they \nhad gained a better understanding of Wordpress. \n\u2022 Students indicated they would be accessing their \nportfolios regularly (some daily) for different \npurposes including the management of university \nwork, to showcase achievements, and to \ncommunicate their thoughts. \n\u2022 When asked if creating an ePortfolio had made \nthem feel different about their learning, students \nindicated that it had helped them to focus on \nthemselves and their work. Other comments \nincluded their ePortfolio was helping them to learn \nby \u201cdoing\u201d. \n \nV. CONCLUSIONS  \nThe purpose of this research was to establish the skills \nand experience of the student cohort on entry, and seek \nrelationships between those skills and the overall success of \nthe ePortfolio development exercise. \n \nAll students successfully developed an ePortfolio. They \nwere engaged in the exercise from the outset and required \nlittle guidance and assistance. Through observation and \nindividual comments the majority of students found the \nplatform intuitive and the personalisation element was \nconsidered to be an important aspect of the development \nprocess for most students. Engagement levels in the \nworkshop sessions were high and within a short space of \ntime many students created a significant amount of textual \nand multimedia content relating to their study modules. \n \nFollowing the development of their ePortfolios, initial \nviews expressed by students remained unchanged. They \nwould continue to use them for two main purposes: as an \neveryday learning tool, and to show case to demonstrate \nwork.  \n \nPossibly the two most important comments from \nstudents in terms of ePortfolio development benefitting the \nlearning process, were: \u201clearning by doing\u201d, echoing the \nsentiments of Kolb\u2019s experiential cycle learning theory [21] \nand \u201cI think it [the portfolio] has focused me and is aiding \nme in focusing my work\u201d, which indicates students being \nbetter placed to take ownership of their learning and \nconfirms Rebbeck\u2019s findings of the centrality of ePorfolios \nin the learning experience [12]. \n \nThe success of the ePortfolio creation exercise would \nsuggest that students are enthusiastic and willing to use \nthese tools in learning. The level and the extent of success in \ntheir usage did not appear to be directly linked to prior \nknowledge of the Web 2.0 technologies employed although \nsuch knowledge did allow a more rapid implementation to \nbe developed.  \n \nThis research was carried out with a relatively small and \nprescribed cohort of students. The next stage of the research \nwill go on to track and evaluate ePortfolio usage over time \nand introduce the trialling of new aspects of ePortfolio \ninteraction, including that of mobile devices. It will also \nbroaden the base away from technology students whose \nprior knowledge may mean they are predisposed to adopting \nthese tools. \n \n \n \nREFERENCES \n[1] M.L. Fox, 2009.
