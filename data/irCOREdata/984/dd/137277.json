A suitably phased sound\nwave in the intake port can maintain a pressure ratio across the closing intake valve\nthat remains favourable to inflow to the cylinder until the valve finally closes. The\norigin of such waves has been shown to be a resonant response of the intake duct to\nthe forcing caused by the unsteady volume flow through the intake valve [2].\nDetailed measurements of the wave dynamics are required to: optimise the\nperformance of an engine, to validate the results of an engine performance simulation\nor to better understand the physics of the intake system. Five different methods for\nmaking such measurements are discussed in this paper. In choosing candidate\nmethods for this study, all optical diagnostic techniques were precluded due to their\nneed for optical access to the intake port. This decision was made in order that all\nmethods considered might be suitable for all IC engines rather than being confined to\nspecial optical engines.\n2 The test case\nAll measurements were made on a Ricardo E6 single cylinder engine. The 0.5 litre\nengine was fitted with a large airbox and orifice plate for airflow rate measurement.\nThis was atop a 1.4m straight walled intake pipe as shown in Figure 1.\nThe intake system was equipped with a fixed venturi carburettor, although no fuel was\ndelivered to this. Instead the engine was motored with the fuel and ignition systems\nHarrison, Stanev Measuring intake wave dynamics, Revision 1\n3\nswitched off. An earlier study [2] had shown that motored and firing wave dynamics\nwere sufficiently similar to allow the sole study of the more convenient motored case.\nThe effect of the airbox on the wave dynamics is also known to be small [3].\nOne end of the crankshaft is exposed on the Ricardo E6 and a slotted disk was\nattached to this. This was used along with an optical sensor to provide an\ninstantaneous measure of crankshaft rotation with respect to the piston top dead centre\nposition as well as an indication of engine speed.\nThe intake system was drilled and tapped at several locations along its length. Two\nKistler type 4045A2 (2 bar) piezo-resistive pressure transducers were used on\noccasion as described in Section 3. These allow a direct measure of both static and\ndynamic pressures in the intake system. Their signals are amplified using two Kistler\ntype 4611 amplifiers and the resulting fluctuating voltages were digitised using an\nIotech Daqbook200 system and stored on a PC.\nIn-cylinder pressures were measured using a Kistler type 6117b (250 bar) measuring\nspark plug along with a Kistler type 5011 charge amplifier. The piezo-electric sensor\ndoes not give an indication of static pressure, only the fluctuating part so a particular\ncalibration strategy was employed as described in Section 3.3 to overcome this.\nThe pressure drop across the orifice plate on the airbox was measured using a Druck\ntype LP1500 (625 pa) differential pressure gauge.\nHarrison, Stanev Measuring intake wave dynamics, Revision 1\n4\nIn addition to these four pressure transducers a holder was fitted to the intake pipe to\naccommodate a single hot wire anemometer probe. The wire used was a Dantec type\n55P11 that was 2.5\u03bcm thick and 2mm long. The holder ensured that the mean inlet\nflow was normal to the wire in order to preserve flow sensitivity [4].\nFinally, a bi-directional pitot static probe was constructed. This was deliberately\nmade to size so it could be screwed into any of the tappings made for the pressure\ntransducers. This unusual probe is described in detail in Section 3.5.\nThe digitised signals recorded on the Iotech Daqbook200 system were post processed\noff line using codes written in Matlab\u2122.\n3 Experimental methods and results\nFive experimental methods for the investigation of the intake wave dynamics were\nstudied. The first is the conventional analysis of pressure records (Section 3.1). The\nsecond is a direct way of measuring the specific acoustic impedance spectrum (the\nratio of fluctuating acoustic pressure to fluctuating particle velocity) at a position\nremote from the intake valve (Section 3.2). The third is an indirect way of measuring\nvolume velocity time history through the intake valve (Section 3.3). The fourth and\nfifth are direct methods for measuring flow velocity time history using a hot wire\nanemometer (Section 3.4) and a bi-directional pitot static tube (Section 3.5)\nrespectively.\nHarrison, Stanev Measuring intake wave dynamics, Revision 1\n5\n3.1 Pressure time history analysis\nReferring to Figure 1, one Kistler type 4045A2 pressure sensor was positioned in the\nwall of the 50mm diameter intake pipe, 550mm from the airbox. The engine was run\nand then motored at wide-open throttle and around 2000 rev\/min-1. Using the output\nof the optical crankshaft sensor, the pressure record from a single motored cycle is\nshown against one from the running (firing) engine in Figure 2. The physics of the\nintake process that cause such intake pressure records is discussed elsewhere [2]. The\nintention here is to discuss the practicalities of this method and the usefulness of the\nresults.\nFigure 2 shows a pressure time history along with an average spectrum of the motored\npressure record. The latter is obtained by performing a 2048 point FFT on a signal\nacquired at 4096Hz, thus producing a spectrum with 2Hz resolution. A moving\nHanning window with variable length overlap allows many such FFTs to be generated\nfrom a modest length data sequence and a reliable average spectrum is therefore\nobtained.\nThe usefulness of the single pressure record is greatly enhanced if a crankshaft sensor\nenables the labelling of the record with key events (intake valve opening (IVO),\nexhaust valve closing (EVC), 90o after top dead centre (ATDC), bottom dead centre\n(BDC) and intake valve closed (IVC)). A well-behaved engine that is firing, will be\nwithout sudden pressure gradient reversals at around IVO, EVC or IVC that signify\nHarrison, Stanev Measuring intake wave dynamics, Revision 1\n6\noutflow from the cylinder and will also exhibit a high-pressure peak 20-50o before\nIVC [2].\nIn the case shown in Figure 2 the crankshaft sensor could not be used directly to label\nthe pressure record as the pressure was measured some 850mm from the intake valve\nand the propagation delay from the valve to this position was unknown. The\npropagation delay can be estimated by assuming that the propagation of pressure from\nthe valve occurs at a speed given by the speed of sound minus the spatial average flow\nvelocity. Assuming 343ms-1 for the former and 15ms-1 for the latter, for the case\nshown in Figure 2, the position of labels IVO, EVC etc would have to be retarded by\n29.4o to correct for the time of flight between the intake valve and the pressure sensor.\nThere are two alternatives to this method for correcting the IVO, EVC etc labels. The\nexpensive alternative is to position a second pressure sensor near the valve and plot\nthat with its correct labels. Assuming that the pressure wave does not distort as it\npropagates, the data from the remote position can be shifted so that it lines up with the\ndata recorded at the valve. The cheaper alternative to this is to briefly interrupt the\nignition (for a spark ignition engine) or the fuel injection (for a common rail diesel\nengine), which often results in a flow reversal between IVO and EVC, which can be\nused as a timing mark. This particular technique has been used for Figure 2.\nThe plotting of a pressure spectrum along with the pressure record gives insight into\nthe wave dynamics. The dynamics are those of a resonant system, exited by the\nunsteady flow through the valves [2]. The lowest frequency peak in the spectrum (at\nfrequency f0) yields an estimate of the engine speed:\nHarrison, Stanev Measuring intake wave dynamics, Revision 1\n7\nEngine speed = fo x 120 rev\/min-1 (1)\nwhich is 1980 rev\/min in the case of Figure 2, and the frequency of dominant peak (at\nfrequency f1) yields an estimate of the acoustic length, x, of the intake pipe.\n(m)\nf4\n343\nx\n1\n\uf03d (2)\nwhich is 1.34m in the case of Figure 2.\n3.2 Wave decomposition\nConsider a pressure wave originating at the opening intake valve and propagating\ntowards the open end of the intake duct where it is strongly reflected. Due to the\ncyclic operation of the I.C. engine such waves are created continuously and they\ninteract to form a complex distributed sound field in the intake system. That sound\nfield may be described in space and time using positive and negative (with reference\nto positive spatial coordinate x) travelling wave components p+ and p- respectively.\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029kx\u03c9tikx\u03c9ti epeptx,P \uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\uf02b \uf02b\uf03d (3)\nwhere P (x, t) is the fluctuating acoustic pressure at frequency \u03c9 rads-1 and k is the\nwavenumber.\nHarrison, Stanev Measuring intake wave dynamics, Revision 1\n8\nEquation (3) can be re-written in terms of frequency and the spatial coordinate, thus:\n\uf028 \uf029 kxikxi epepx\u03c9,P \uf02d\uf02d\uf02b \uf02b\uf03d (4)\nIf pressure spectra are found at two locations in the intake pipe that are close together\n(50-150mm apart) then a pair of simultaneous equations is constructed, each in the\nform of equation (4) and these can be solved algebraically to obtain p+ and p-. This is\nthe basis of the now well-understood wave decomposition method [5-7]. In the work\nreported here, a particular variant of the method is used [8].\nReferring to Figure 1, one Kistler type 4045A2 piezo-resistive pressure sensor is\npositioned at a distance x1 = 550mm from the airbox and another at x2 = 700mm from\nthe airbox. Their amplified signals are recorded directly onto a HHB type MDP500\nmini-disc recorder, which has the effect of AC coupling the signals, thus, isolating the\nfluctuating pressure from the total pressure sensed by the pressure sensor\nA comment is needed on the implications of using the mini-disc recording system for\nthese measurements. The MDP500 recorder was first considered for use because it\noffered an inexpensive way of recording a pair of long pressure time histories with\nhigh signal to noise ratio. It is well known that the mini-disc recording system\nemploys a particular form of data compression that normally makes it unsuitable for\nlaboratory grade measurements. As it was not possible to pre-judge the effects of the\ndata compression on the results obtained from wave-decomposition, a validation\nexercise was undertaken before the MDP500 was accepted for use [8]. Wave-\ndecomposition measurements were made in a length of straight pipe, strongly excited\nwith broadband white noise, and in the absence of mean flow. The acoustic reflection\nHarrison, Stanev Measuring intake wave dynamics, Revision 1\n9\ncoefficient at the open end of the tube was measured and found to agree well with\nlinear acoustic theory [9] in the frequency range of interest (20-2000 Hz).\nNotwithstanding concerns over the effects of data compression, the MDP500 was\naccepted for use in the particular case of wave-decomposition on the basis that no\nevidence of corruption was found in the results of the validation exercise.\nWe can write:\n\uf028 \uf029 11 x\u03b2ix\u03b2111 epepx\u03c9P \uf02d\uf02b \uf02d\uf02d\uf02b \uf02b\uf03d (5)\n\uf028 \uf029 22 x\u03b2ix\u03b2212 epepx\u03c9P \uf02d\uf02b \uf02d\uf02d\uf02b \uf02b\uf03d (6)\nwhere\n\uf028 \uf029\nM1\ni1\u03b1k\u03b2\n\uf02b\n\uf02d\uf02b\uf03d\uf02b (7)\nand\n\uf028 \uf029\nM1\ni1\u03b1k\u03b2\n\uf02d\n\uf02d\uf02b\uf03d\uf02d (8)\nare complex wavenumbers that take account of the effects of visco thermal\nattenuation through the attenuation coefficient \u03b1 and mean flow speed through the\nMach number M [9].

Inspection of the\npressure spectrum in Figure 2 shows low levels of excitation at frequencies above a\nfew harmonics of the cycle frequency, therefore, poor signal to noise and, hence, poor\ncoherence is expected at higher frequencies.\nFigure 4 shows the coherence \u03c3 applicable to *PS\n\uf028 \uf029\uf05b \uf05d\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf0292,2.1,1\n1,2\n2\n*\nP\n*\nP\n*\nP\nSS\nS\uf03d\u03c3 (16)\nThe compound effect of two sets of limited signal to noise ratio *PS (first in SP and\nthen in G) is shown in reduced coherence at all frequencies above 200Hz.\nReturning to the wave decomposition itself we can re-write (10,11) as:\n\uf028 \uf029 2111 KpKp1,1 \uf02d\uf02b \uf02b\uf03d*PS (17)\n\uf028 \uf029 4131 KpKp1,2 \uf02d\uf02b \uf02b\uf03d*PS (18)\nand solve these algebraically to yield:\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\uf02d\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\uf02d\n\uf03d\uf02b\n4\n2\n31\n4\n2\nK\nK\nKK\nK\nK\n.1,21,1\np\n*\nP\n*\nP SS\n(19)\nHarrison, Stanev Measuring intake wave dynamics, Revision 1\n13\n\uf028 \uf029\n2\n1\nK\nKp1,1\np\n\uf02b\n\uf02d \uf02d\uf03d\n*\nPS (20)\np+ and p- are complex values of the wave component amplitude at a plane in the duct.\nIf in equations (5,6) x1 = 0.45m and x2 = 0.3m the \uf02d\uf02b pandp are calculated for a plane\nthat is 1m from the airbox.

The agreement is good at frequencies below 200Hz where\nthe coherence is high (Figure 4).\nSo the wave decomposition technique allows the direct measurement of acoustic\nimpedance at a plane in the intake duct. The first use for this is in the assessment of\nresonant frequencies (where \u03b6 goes to a maximum) although for this the reference \nplane should be the intake valve and one of the pressure sensors should be placed\nnearby which is not always easy.\nA second use is in the refinement of engine simulation models. These involve the\ntime domain solution of the gas dynamics in the intake system. Appropriate acoustic\nend corrections are added to some pipe lengths in order that the computed results may\nmatch measured results [10]. These end corrections can be found by experiment\nusing the wave decomposition method.\nmkl2i\u03b8i eReRr \uf02d\uf03d\uf03d (23)\nwhere lm is the physical length plus the end correction.\n3.3 Pressure drop across the intake valve\nThe unsteady mass flow through the intake valve (in kgs-1) is routinely calculated\nusing the well-known model [10].\nHarrison, Stanev Measuring intake wave dynamics, Revision 1\n15\n2\n1\n\u03b3\n1\u03b3\nC\n1\n\u03b3\n2\nC\n1\n2\nC\neC\nP\nP\n1\nP\nP\n1\u03b3\n\u03b32\nc\nAP\nm\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\uf02d\uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\n\uf02d\n\uf026 (24)\nwhere\nPC = cylinder pressure (Pa)\nP1 = intake port pressure (Pa)\ncc = speed of sound in the cylinder\nAe = Am C\nAm = valve open area (m2)\nC = flow loss coefficient (measured on a flow bench)\nThis will normally be part of an engine simulation where PC and P1 are also\ncalculated. However, if PC and P1 are in fact measured quantities then the unsteady\nmass flow through the valve may valve may be measured indirectly [11].\nTo make this measurement, the open area under the intake valve must be known\nthroughout the engine cycle and an appropriate set of empirical flow loss coefficients\nmeasured or selected. In this case, these were already well defined for the Ricardo E6\nengine.\nA Kistler type 4045A2 piezo-resistive pressure transducer was located in the intake\nport, close to the intake valve. A piezo-electric pressure transducer (Kistler type\n6117b) replaced the regular spark plug used with the engine. The engine was motored\nat various speeds and signals from the sensors were digitised using the Iotech\nDaqbook200 system along with the output from the optical crankshaft sensor.\nHarrison, Stanev Measuring intake wave dynamics, Revision 1\n16\nAs already mentioned, the Kistler type 6117b pressure sensor does not measure static\npressures and, hence, (even when the engine is motored to avoid thermal shock to the\nsensor) there is some uncertainty over the absolute calibration of the output signal. A\ncommon technique to limit the effect of this is to use a piezo-resistive pressure sensor\nin the intake port and to DC shift the pressure data obtained from the piezo-electric\ndevice so that it matches that from the piezo-resistive device when the piston is at the\nbottom dead centre of the intake stroke.\nA refinement of that technique has been applied here. Having done that, measured\nand DC shifted data for PC is used along with measured data for P1 in Equation 24 to\ncalculate the unsteady mass flow during the intake period (IVO \u2013 IVC). The time\nintegral of that mass flow rate time history is then compared to the mass flow rate\nmeasured using the orifice plate fitted to the airbox (Figure: 1). The DC shift applied\nto the cylinder pressure (some 2-3 bar) is then adjusted until the two measures of mass\nflow rate agree. For the case of 1921 rev\/min the corrected cylinder pressure is shown\nagainst the measured port pressure in Figure 8. The resulting air mass flow rate is\nshown in Figure 9. The flow reversal soon after IVO (as predicted in Figure 2) is\nshown as a negative mass flow rate denoting outflow from the cylinder.\nThe corrected cylinder pressure in Figure 8 is actually the ensemble average of the\ndata from 10 cycles. The equally spaced dips in the data are due to electro-magnetic\nnoise that frequently corrupt signals obtained using such sensors [12]. If this were\nremoved by filtration the trace in Figure 9 would be much smoother.\nHarrison, Stanev Measuring intake wave dynamics, Revision 1\n17\nIf we make the simplifying assumption that the density of the intake flow remains at\nthe stagnation density (1.19 kg m-3 in this case) then we can calculate the volume\nvelocity through the valve. Knowing the instantaneous open area under the valve we\ncan easily calculate the flow velocity through the valve as shown in Figure 10. The\nflow reversal has a velocity that is instantaneously sonic shortly after IVO but the\naverage flow speed through the valve is more like 0.25M.\nThe calculated volume velocity also allows the calculation of the flow velocity in the\nnarrow intake port (Figure 11 : 0.15M typical) and in the wider intake pipe (Figure 12\n: 0.07M typical).\nThis method is a useful way of measuring the volume velocity source strength of the\nintake process which is the cause of the wave action in the intake pipe [2]. The results\ncan be compared directly with those computed by engine simulation for an alternative\nform of validation of the calculated results. For engine developers, the method also\nquantifies the extent of any flow reversals soon after IVO that will reduce volumetric\nefficiency.\n3.4 Hot wire anemometry\nA single wire constant temperature anemometer can be used to measure the amplitude\n(but not the direction) of the flow at one point in the intake system. The electronics of\nthe system contains a Wheatstone bridge circuit with the sensor as one arm of the\nbridge, and two fixed values resistors and one variable resistor completes the circuit\n[13]. A differential feedback amplifier senses the bridge unbalance and adds current\nHarrison, Stanev Measuring intake wave dynamics, Revision 1\n18\nto hold the sensor temperature (and, hence, resistance) constant when the wire is\nbeing cooled by a gas flow. The voltage across the bridge is proportional to the gas\nvelocity and the sensitivity of the sensor is governed by the wire temperature.\nThe Wheatstone bridge is only balanced at one velocity and becomes unbalanced as\nthe velocity changes. The feedback amplifier is fast acting giving a nearly balanced\ncircuit a good high frequency response. The frequency response of the circuit may be\ntested using a square electrical wave input and a dummy electric resistor in place of\nthe hot wire [13]. A high frequency response will allow the square wave to be\nreproduced faithfully.\nThe frequency response of the actual probe in the circuit must be checked in a fluid at\nthe same velocity to be measured. The bandwidth of the sensor and signal\nconditioning can then be maximised by tuning the settings of the electronics. This\nproved difficult in this case as the flow velocity in the intake pipe varies strongly even\nthrough one four-stroke cycle but with perseverance a compromise setting was found\nthat gave adequate sensitivity and acceptable bandwidth.\nThe balancing of the Wheatstone bridge and the subsequent calibration of the system\nwere performed using the experimental set-up shown in Figure 13. Compressed air\npasses through a filter and then a regulating valve and into a calibration unit where it\nemerges as a free jet. A differential pressure manometer measures the pressure drop\nacross the nozzle and the free stream flow velocity v is calculated from:\namb\nambNOZZLE\nP\nTRP\u03942\nv\uf03d (25)\nHarrison, Stanev Measuring intake wave dynamics, Revision 1\n19\nwhere Pamb and Tamb are ambient pressure and temperature respectively, R is the\nuniversal gas constant and \u0394 PNOZZLE is the pressure difference measured across the\nnozzle.\nThe hot-wire is exposed to a flow having a known velocity and a voltage output from\nthe signal conditioning is measured. This is repeated for varying flow velocities.\nFlow speed is controlled by changing the nozzle size and by using the air supply\ncontrol valve.\nFor flow speeds up to 15m\/s a fourth order polynomial was used to describe the\nrelationship between flow speed and the voltage recorded during the calibration. At\nhigher speeds the calibration is based on a linear law. This composite calibration was\nused when experimenting on the engine intake along with a Butterworth low pass\nfilter set at 64Hz (the dominant frequency of oscillation in the intake pipe \u2013 Figure 2).\nThis was needed to overcome severe problems with electromagnetic noise on the hot-\nwire signals. This was found to be an unavoidable output from the dynamometer.\nIt should be noted that the hot wire anemometer system cannot be used to measure\nvelocities downstream of the carburettor, with a firing engine, as the evaporating fuel\ndroplets would affect the calibration of the device.\nThe results of the hot-wire experiment at around 2000 rev\/min is shown in Figure 14.\nThe calibrated output of the hot-wire signal is of course a rectified oscillation and the\nforward-reverse flow ambiguity is overcome by declaring that negative flow velocity\nHarrison, Stanev Measuring intake wave dynamics, Revision 1\n20\nis accompanied by a pressure depression. This also makes the comparison of pressure\nand velocity records easier on the eye.\nThe magnitude of the velocity in the period IVO-IVC agrees well with that found\nfrom an indirect measurement of the flow through the intake pipe (Section 3.3) Figure\n12.\nAfter IVC there is only a small mean flow in the intake pipe and the velocity recorded\nis that of a rapidly decaying oscillation about decaying mean flow velocity.\nOne should note that the fluctuating pressure and velocities are not measured in the\nsame axial position. The pressure measurement was made some 0.15m upstream of\nthe hot wire so that the pressure sensor did not foul the hot wire probe. Also the\nsecond plot in Figure 14 shows the fluctuating torque recorded during the\nexperiments.\n3.5 Bi-directional pitot static probe\nA rather unusual bi-directional pitot static probe was trialled. This was a development\nof a much less sensitive earlier device [15]. The layout of the device is shown in\nFigure 15. The device uses two Kistler Type 4045A2 piezo-resistive pressure\ntransducers located in the same plane of the intake pipe. The first measures the static\npressure. The second measures a pressure quantity that approximates to the total\npressure.\nHarrison, Stanev Measuring intake wave dynamics, Revision 1\n21\nThis second sensor is fitted to a probe. The probe has two narrow bore pipes\nprotruding from a small chamber directly in front of the pressure sensors. The tubes\nare bent so that one faces directly into the inflow in the pipe, and the second faces\ndirectly into the reverse flow.\nThe difference between the voltage signals from the two pressure sensors is an\napproximation of the fluctuating dynamic head resolved into two flow directions.\nWith the engine motored at 2000 rev\/min a dynamic calibration has been achieved by\ncomparing the largest voltage difference obtained from the two sensors with the\nlargest flow velocity measured with a hot wire (Figure 14).\nFigure 16 shows a measurement of the oscillating flow velocity in the intake pipe\nobtained using the bi-directional pitot-static probe calibrated with respect to hot wire\nresults obtained earlier.\nThe device seems to have adequate frequency response. It is interesting to note that\nthe rate of decay of the oscillating velocity after IVC is less in these results than those\nobtained using the hot wire. The decay rate obtained for the velocity using the bi-\ndirectional pitot static probe matches the decay rate seen in the corresponding\npressure records whilst the same is not true for the hot wire anemometer results. This\nis probably due to the effects on the hot wire results of using a combination of fourth\norder polynomial and linear laws to describe the calibration across a wide variation in\nvelocity.\nHarrison, Stanev Measuring intake wave dynamics, Revision 1\n22\n4 Discussion\nFive experimental methods of measuring wave action in the intake system of an IC\nengine have been investigated. No single method is perfect or indeed universally\napplicable to all situations and in a typical investigation of wave action more than one\nmethod is likely to be used.\nThe main strengths and weaknesses of each method are as follows:\n1. Pressure time history analysis; Strengths \u2013 simple and robust; Weaknesses \u2013\nonly provides information on pressure fluctuations and not on the\naccompanying velocity fluctuations.\n2. Wave decomposition; Strengths \u2013 measures the specific acoustic impedance\nratio directly; Weaknesses \u2013 only reliable at low frequencies, only provides the\nratio of pressure and velocity, cannot distinguish between the open valve and\nclosed valve cases.\n3. Pressure drop across the intake valve; Strengths \u2013 provides pressure and\nvelocity time histories; Weaknesses \u2013 only works for the portion of the engine\ncycle when the intake valve is open, prone to the ill effects of noisy pressure\nsignals, needs a large quantity of empirical data relating to the engine (flow\nloss coefficients, valve lift curves and intake port and valve dimensions) to\ncalculate the final results.\nHarrison, Stanev Measuring intake wave dynamics, Revision 1\n23\n4. Hot wire anemometry with pressure measurements; Strengths \u2013 gives pressure\nand velocity time histories for the whole engine cycle; Weaknesses \u2013 cannot\nbe used when fuel is introduced to the intake flow, fragile wires have a limited\nservice life, calibration is difficult to perfect.\n5. Bi-directional pitot-static tube; Strengths \u2013 robust with good dynamic and\nfrequency response; Weaknesses \u2013 requires calibration against another method\nof velocity measurement such as a hot wire anemometry\nInspecting the strengths and weaknesses of the alternative methods it seems that using\nwave decomposition to measure the effective acoustic length of the intake pipe\n(actually the specific impedance ratio is measured and the effective length is\ndetermined using an acoustic model and reverse engineering) and using the bi-\ndirectional pitot static probe to measure oscillating pressure and velocity time\nhistories seems to be a generally applicable and useful measurement strategy.\nHarrison, Stanev Measuring intake wave dynamics, Revision 1\n24\n5 Conclusions\nOf the five methods investigated, the combined use of wave decomposition and the\nbi-directional pitot-static tube seems to offer a robust, reliable and useful strategy for\nmeasuring wave dynamics in the intake pipe that should prove successful on most IC\nengines.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the support of EPSRC under Grant No:\nGR\/R04324 for this work.\nHarrison, Stanev Measuring intake wave dynamics, Revision 1\n25\nReferences\n1 A.
