However, most compensation\nplans tend to be focused on profitability and profitability-related accomplishments with\nlittle or no incentive for corporate social responsibility. Director\u2019s compensation\ncontinues to climb with the United States leading and Britain following modestly behind.\nThe question as to where fair pay ends and over-compensation begins - and what that\nmeans for the community - is rarely raised. In order to understand the impact of fair and\nover-compensated director\u2019s pay on other stakeholders, a geo-political perspective is\nproposed that builds on knowledge of existing theories of the firm.1\nKey words: Directors\u2019 remuneration, geo-politics of executive pay, executive pay\nstructures, executives\u2019 pay models, executive pay incentives.\nIntroduction\nThe debate on toil, what it is and what it is worth pre-occupies scholars and practitioners alike. The\nhistorian, Thomas Carlyle, argued that \u2018all true work is sacred\u2019 (Carlyle, 1999: 206). In contrast, his\ncontemporary philosopher, John Stuart Mill, held that work \u2018is not good in itself as there is nothing\nlaudable in work for work\u2019s sake\u2019 (Mill, 1998). The benefit to be gained from work is that of\ncompensation and it is this latter view that has captured the limelight. The last two decades have been\ndominated by the corporate mantra of \u2018shareholder value\u2019 and rising remuneration packages for\nexecutives (Frederick, 1986). At the same time, the remuneration of directors is one of the most intensely\nresearched and, perhaps, least understood areas of management. The director\u2019s remuneration\nphenomenon attracts concern and emotion from shareholders, employers, politicians, the press and global\nstakeholders. Although a number of longitudinal studies (O\u2019Reilly et al, 1988; Main et al, 1995; Buck et\nal, 2001) and empirical surveys (Abowd and Kaplan, 1999; Camp, 1989) have attempted to explain the\ninteraction between remuneration structure and company performance, very little has been done to\nexplain the remunerator\u2019s magnitude, structure and sensitivity to the long-term impact on stakeholders\nand wider community (Bowen, 1953). The scholarly debate primarily focuses on the company director\u2019s\nremuneration incentives with only an occasional mention in the popular press of the growing divide\nbetween the \u2018haves\u2019 and the \u2018have nots\u2019. Particularly, the debate over executive directors\u2019 remuneration\nhas focused on three aspects of the remuneration package, namely:\n1 This manuscript has greatly benefited from the review comments made by Ruth Bender, Cranfield\nSchool of Management and the journal\u2019s anonymous reviewers.\n2\uf0b7 the magnitude of basic remuneration and reward increases;\n\uf0b7 the structure of remuneration, with a focus on the large gains from share\noptions and the compensation payments to directors on loss of office; and\n\uf0b7 the sensitivity of the remuneration incentive to share price performance.\nThis paper provides an overview of the current debate and theories that attempt to explain directors\u2019\nremuneration. Attention is given to Agency, Economic and Socio-Comparative approaches and\nunderlying theories (Coase, 1960). It is concluded that although a number of theoretical perspectives\nprovide some explanation of the phenomena, none truly explain it (Ackerman and Bauer, 1976). It is\nargued that a geo-political perspective is required, namely one that takes into account the impact on\ncommunity needs in determining these factors (Chamberlain, 1973; Carroll, 1979). A geo-political model\nis presented, concluding that broader inter-disciplinary research is needed in finding solutions to the\ncomplex issue of directors\u2019 remuneration integral to corporate governance and the global community\n(Coase, 1937).\nThe Agency Approach\nSince its conception, Berle and Means\u2019 (1932) Principal-Agent model underpins the philosophy of\nthe modern theory of the firm and many models of corporate governance, including that of executive\ncompensation (Ratneser, 2000). Providing incentives to managers of publicly-owned companies is the\nclassic example of the Principal-Agent challenge that assumes that the primary means for shareholders to\nensure that managers take optimal actions is to tie managers\u2019 pay to the performance of their firm; in\neffect to provide incentives for managers to maximise returns to shareholders (Berle and Means, 1932).\nPursuing such a linkage is considered to align the interests of managers with the interests of shareholders.\nConsidering that executives take non-transparent and unobserved actions that affect returns to\nshareholders, Principal-Agent Theory suggests that executive compensation needs to be correlated with\nthe total return to shareholders, typically through ownership of the firm\u2019s stock or options on the firm\u2019s\nstock. However, despite the compelling logic of the Principal-Agent framework, there is little existing\n3empirical support for the effectiveness of the Principal-Agent model when applied to executive\ncompensation. Using pay-performance sensitivity measures, a number of empirical studies are unable to\nsupport the executive reward\/corporate performance linkages underlying the Principal-Agent model\n(Jensen and Murphy, 1990; Janakiraman et al, 1992; Garen, 1994; Haubrich, 1994; Aggarwal and\nSamwick, 1999). In general, these studies found that the pay-performance sensitivity for executives at\nfirms with the least volatile stock prices is an order of magnitude greater than pay-performance\nsensitivity for executives at firms with the most volatile stock prices (Aggarwal and Samwick, 1999).\nOverall, a number of empirical studies (Barro and Barro, 1990; Janakiraman et al, 1992) have found that\ncompensation increases according to industry performance. However, the agency perspective holds that\nthe remuneration contract should be used to align the interests of the director with those of the\nshareholder and such thinking has underpinned many regulatory committees in this area (Jensen and\nMeckling, 1976). For example in the UK, the Cadbury (1992), Greenbury (1995) and Hampel (1998)\nCommittees have taken this perspective.\nOverall, agency theory predicts that the separation of owners and managers potentially leads to\nmanagers of firms taking actions, which do not maximise shareholder wealth (Jensen and Meckling,\n1976). Such action may include excessive salaries for directors not tied to performance or them\nundertaking value-destroying mergers. The agency framework suggests that internal monitoring\nmechanisms will help to ensure that directors implement policies consistent with the maximisation of\nshareholders\u2019 wealth. These include non-executive director representation to monitor board decisions,\nseparation of the chairman and chief executive posts and the establishment of board sub-committees.\nThe Economic\/Market Approach\nThe dominant model of the firm continues to be of Neo-Classical Theory derived from Adam Smith\u2019s\n(1937) idea of the relationship between producers\/owners and consumers, where the under-pinning\ntheme is market forces and rationality (Friedman, 1962). Thus, economic values guide choice and\nchoices are rational and utility maximising. In Neo-Classical economic theory, the goal of Smith\u2019s (1937)\nEconomic Man is to maximise the wealth of the firm and is based on contractual duties owed to owners\n(Brenner and Cochran, 1991). The main assumption is that the only duties the firm has to external others\n4are financial and these duties are owed to the owners which, in the case of modern corporations, are\nshareholders (Brenner and Cochran, 1991).\nMoreover, in order to resolve agency tensions, external control mechanisms such as market\ncompetition and internal control mechanisms such as corporate governance, are mostly utilised. In order\nto enhance internal controls, improvement of corporate governance has been interpreted as increasing the\nnumber of external directors with them being attentive to corporate direction and control; exemplified by\npension fund activism (Branceto, 1997). Market mechanisms are left to supply and demand for goods\nand services and price competition for the delivery of goods. The economic approach uses a subset of\nContract Theory and Agency Theory to explain and predict firm behaviour; notably that managers act as\nagents for stockholders\/principals.\nHowever, the market\/economic perspective is increasingly being criticised. One view is that markets\nare social constructs that need support to survive and prosper. Top executives do not generate wealth by\nthemselves; they do so against a backdrop of social institutions and human capital. Is it then fair and\nlegitimate that the market should set the terms on which the few can accumulate wealth? (Prowse, 2000).\nAn additional perspective is that globalisation and information technology (IT) have increased the\nimportance of worldwide factors in steering share prices, often at the expense of local country factors. On\nthis basis, individual stock markets are increasingly being driven by global, rather than local, factors\n(Brooks and Catao, 2000). The increased mobility of capital, combined with more efficient trading\nsystems, under-pinned by the advance of IT, has increased cross-border trading of shares, creating\nsomething closer to a global equity market (Brooks and Catao, 2000). With the proliferation of Internet-\nbased technology, it has become both increasingly easier for investors to acquire information on foreign\nfirms and for large corporations to be listed on more than one market. In addition, the wave of cross-\nborder mergers and acquisitions results in overseas profits accounting for a larger slice of company\nperformance. The fact that an enterprise belongs to a particular industry, be it pharmaceuticals or utilities,\nhas become more important in explaining variations in returns on investment, over time, than the\nenterprises\u2019 home country market (Brooks and Catao, 2000). The question raised is, how can current\nlevels of executive pay be justified when the transformational element of a CEO\u2019s role is minimised and\nthe transactional component accentuated? (Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 1999).\n5The Social Comparison Approach\nThe social comparison perspective explains firm behaviour by integrating observed social\nperformance with observed economic performance (Sethi, 1975; 1979). In addition, the comparison\nperspective builds on Socio-Physiological and Legitimacy Theory, emphasising, for example, role\nexpectations and role behaviours (Katz and Kahn, 1978; Biddle, 1986) and roles as determinants of\nsocial position and organisational status (Biddle, 1979; 1986). Moreover, the concept of role sets\n(Merton, 1957) and concepts of organisational sets (Evan, 1966) are identified as the underpinnings of\nStakeholder Theory (Freeman, 1984). The social comparison perspective holds that the magnitude and\nstructure of executive remuneration can be determined by comparisons of observable performance of\ndirectors across industries (Heald, 1970; Jones, 1995). It assumes that the members of an organisation\u2019s\nremuneration committee, composed of non-executive directors, form opinion and approve the magnitude\nof directors\u2019 remuneration by making comparisons with their own executive roles and remuneration in\ntheir home organisation (Bender and Porter, 2001a; 2001b; 2001c). Ironically, such personalised views of\nexecutive remuneration are being favourably received as over-relying on surveys of executive\ncompensation encouraging a type of \u2018group-think\u2019 such as everyone is doing it, so should we (Power,\n1991).\nMoreover, directors who are at the receiving end of remuneration also make comparison with the\nremuneration of other directors in similar situations to themselves, invoking role expectations and equity\nperceptors which enable them to make a choice to stay with the enterprise or to seek alternatives\n(Merton, 1957; Evan, 1966). These two sets of external peer comparison act as an anchor in determining\nan appropriate level of pay (Hosseini and Brenner, 1992). Similarly, the social comparison perspective\nsuggests that the structure of pay will be based on structures successfully adopted by other companies,\nfinding support in Institutional Theory (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983) in order to legitimise the actions of\nthe home community, as suggested by Legitimacy Theory (Davis, 1973).\n6Overview of Director\u2019s Pay\nConsidering that executive directors do not realise their vision of ever improving share performance\nin the market place alone but depend on internal stakeholders, such as employees and suppliers, and on\nthe external stakeholders, such as legal and financial institutions and governments in the economies of\ntheir operations, it is illuminating to compare directors\u2019 pay with those of Heads of State (Table 1). The\nquestion of what is \u2018fair\u2019 reward is a long debated one. Plato (1991) reasoned that the \u2018right ratio\u2019\nbetween the top and bottom is 5:1. Peter Drucker postulated that is should be 20:1 (Wagner, 1999). The\nnorm in Continental Europe and Japan is a multiple of 18 and 15 (Table 4), whilst in Cyprus and China\nthe ratio is 3:1, respectively (Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 2001). In the USA, the gap between executive\npay and average pay is continuously increasing. The CEO of AT&T earns 400 times what the lowest-\npaid employee earns (Wagner and Minard, 1999).\nTable 1: Basic Pay For CEOs in Medium -Sized\nEnterprises and Head of States (in USA Dollars)\n2001 Basic Annual Pay\n(excluding add-ons)\nUSA UK Japan Germany Sweden France\nEstimated average for\nCEOs in medium-sized\nenterprises (2001)\n530,000 305,000 310,000 210,000 190,000 240,000\nGovernment Head of\nState (2001)\n400,000 225,000 195,000 150,000 105,000 100,000\nSource: Compiled from Towers Perrin (2002); Japan Information Centre (2002); and\nTime (2001)\nOne reason for such disparities in the USA is that since 1994 there has been a large increase in the\nuse of stock options and other incentives to provide for CEO compensation and incentives (Table 2). In\naddition to being an important component of CEO compensation, stock options are also a critical\nconsideration towards CEO equity incentives. Research shows that the options balance in CEO annual\npay varies across industry groupings, whereby in \u2018new economy\u2019 firms (e-high-technology) equity based\ncompensation substantially exceeds that provided in the longer \u2018old economy\u2019, manufacturing and utility\nfirms (Ittner et al, 2001).\n7Table 2: Remuneration Magnitude and Structure of CEO\u2019s Estimated Average Package in\nMedium-Sized Enterprises (in USA Dollars)\nEstimated Average\nCEO\u2019s Pay (2001)\nUSA UK Japan Germany Sweden France\nBasic Pay 530,000 305,000 310,000 210,000 190,000 240,000\nPlus add-ons: 1,403.000 364,00 198,000 245,000 224,000 279,000\n\uf0b7 Variable bonus Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes\n\uf0b7 Compulsory\ncompany\ncontribution\nYes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes\n\uf0b7 Voluntary\ncompany\ncontribution\nYes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes*\n\uf0b7 Pre-requisites Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes\n\uf0b7 Long-term\nincentives\nYes Yes Yes* Yes Yes Yes\nTotal Pay 1,933,000 669,000 508,000 455,000 414,000 519,000\n*A new add-on introduced in 2001, which was not previously used.\nSource: Compiled from Pic (2001); Towers Perrin (2002)\nSimilar to the USA, senior executive remuneration in the UK has increased dramatically and more so\nthan their counterparts in medium sized enterprises (Table 2). In 1999, top British executives were paid\nan average of US$1,004,000 (\u00a3717,000) in which was included a long-term incentive scheme (Prowse,\n2000). The impetus for a shift in the structure of directors\u2019 pay, in the UK, occurred in 1995 with the\npublication of the Greenbury Report (1995), which recommended principles for director remuneration in\nrelation to accountability, transparency and linkage to performance. Until 1995, Unconditional Executive\nDirector\u2019s Share Option schemes (ESOs) were prevalent (Conyon and Murphy, 2000), allowing\nexecutives to purchase company shares in the future at current prices thus giving them every incentive to\nraise share price.\nThe initial ESO structure was scoped in the 1980s in the USA and diffused across UK companies. As\na result of bull markets and regardless of the quality of their decisions, many executives reaped large\ngains although they chose to invest their resources in shares and in transactions openly available to all\n8investors at the time of the options award (Economist, 2001; Time, 1999). This gradually attracted media\ncriticism, leading to tighter regulation by government and self-regulation by the Stock Exchange,\naccountancy professions and institutional investors (Blundell and Robinson, 2000). In turn, more open\ndisclosure of detailed operations of adopted remuneration instruments ensued. Greenbury (1995)\nrecommended that companies replace ESOs with more challenging performance criteria, conditional\nshare options (CESOs) and\/or long-term incentive plans (LTIPs). The LTIP is effectively a CESO, with\na zero exercise price, thus, making no demands on the executive\u2019s own finances. Both CESOs and LTIPs\ncan be seen as different forms of remuneration share-based schemes and are often valued using one of\nthree available valuation models, namely, the value of options issued during a given accounting year, or\nthe cost of all options as if they were \u2018immunised\u2019 by the company thus holding identical value in the\nmarket, or \u2018full cost\u2019 covering the change in the value of all outstanding options plus the cost of the\nexercised options during the year (McKnight and Tomkins, 1999).\nBy the end of 2000, in the UK, the average FTSE 100 CEO earned \u00a31.7 million (Patterson and\nJauhal, 2001). The payouts of \u00a314 million one-off share bonuses to Chris Gent at Vodafone AirTouxh,\ninitially announced as the reward for successful acquisition, provoked not only media attention in the UK\nin 2000 but also concern amongst institutional shareholders (Kennedy, 2000). In addition, the structure of\nGent\u2019s remuneration incentive consisted of seven schemes without clarity or guidelines about the\ncircumstances under which these incentives would be paid (Myners, 2001).\nConsidering that Gent had spent almost \u00a3200 billion on the Mannesmann acquisition \u2013 the equivalent\nof about a quarter of the UK\u2019s GDP in the space of two years, and in the light of last year\u2019s fall of share\nprice from a high of 399 pence to less then 150 pence, it means that Gent spent \u00a3200 billion to create a\nbusiness worth \u00a3100 billion \u2013 an extreme case of value destruction (The Week, 2001). Moreover, in 2001\nVodafone\u2019s award of \u00a38.0 million share options \u2013 potentially worth nearly \u00a313 million to Gent over the\nnext five years, provoked discontent amongst stakeholders (The Week, 2001). Similar concerns were\nexpressed about the \u00a32.8 million payment to Bob Ayling for quitting as CEO of British Airways in the\nwake of slump in profits (Kennedy, 2000). Further, the pay of executives in the utilities sector rose 106%\ncompared with total shareholder return (TSR) for the year of 30% (Patterson and Jauhal, 2001). Ayling\nand Gent are not exceptional cases as it has become more commonplace for director reward to outstrip\n9company performance in terms of shareholder return (Table 3). In the UK, it is increasingly being held\nthat rewarding executives with shares rather than options is fairer, a view that is increasingly becoming\npopular in the USA (Patterson and Jauhal, 2001).\nTable 3: Rewards Versus Performance of FTSE 100 in 2000\nTotal Shareholders\nReturn\nAbove 40% 20%-40% 0%-20% Below 0%\nDirector\u2019s Wealth\nIncrease\n121% 69% 23% -20%\nSource: Compiled from Patterson and Jauhal (2001)\nA strong emergent opinion is that driven by shareholder interests, executive management is focused\non short-term objectives in creating, or at least maintaining, high share prices at the expense of other\nstakeholders, particularly internal stakeholders (Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 2001). As a result, a serious\ndivision is emerging in society between those few rich and the vast majority on \u2018average\u2019 pay. Executive\npay in the USA considerably adds to such division than that of their counterparts in Europe and Japan\n(Table 4). The difference is considerable even in small and medium-sized companies and in the large\ncorporations, considerably higher. In 1997, the top executive\u2019s average remuneration in the USA was\n325 times the average pay of the shop floor worker. In 2000, it was 523 times as great, whilst in 2002 it\nwas 600:1 (Kochan, 2002). The average remuneration of a UK chief executive was 18 times more than\nthe average worker and 20:1 in 2002 (Taylor, 1999; Institute of Policy Studies, 2002). The ratio of 20:1\nis the highest ratio in the European Union, whilst the average pay of French chief executives is 12 times\nthat of the average operative (Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 2001).\nTable 4: Pay Ratio of CEO and Workers\nYear USA UK Japan Germany Sweden France\n1997 325:1 18:1 15:1 13:1 11:1 12:1\n2002 600:1 20: 1 15: 1 14: 1 11:1 12:1\nSource: Kakabadse and Kakabadse (2001); Institute of Policy Studies (2002);\nJapan Information Centre (2002)\n10\nAccording to the Report by the Institute of Policy Studies and United For a Fair Economy (2001), the\naverage pay of the CEOs of 365 major corporations in 2001 was US$13.1 million, which is a 571%\nincrease on the early 1990s. However, the average factory worker\u2019s annual pay was US$24,668, which\nin 2001, if it had grown at the same rate as CEO pay, would be more than US$120,000. In the same vein,\nif the minimum wage of US$3.80 in 1990 had grown at the same rate as CEO pay, (571%) it would, in\n2001, be US$25.50 an hour, rather than US$5.15 an hour (IPS\/UFFE, 2003).\nAs the gap in the USA between executive pay and average operative pay continuously increases, the\nescalated pay of star CEO \u2018performers\u2019 also propagates disparities in pay for second- and third-tier\nexecutives. In the UK, the traditional limit of 50% difference between CEO remuneration and his\/her\ndirect associates has long gone. The gap is widening (Myners, 2001). Research conducted by the\nactuarial firm William Mercer, found that the average value of share options awarded to senior\nexecutives in blue-chip companies had doubled over the previous year (Kennedy, 2000).\nWhether such a state of affairs will continue has been thrown into doubt as in January 2003 the UK\u2019s\nFTSE 100 Index fell by 143.4 points wiping out \u00a3700 billion from the value of stocks and representing a\ndrop of 50.2% from the share value peak of 1999 (Paterson et al, 2003). With such decline in value,\nactivist shareholders are increasingly not accepting \u2018fat cat\u2019 pay packages. Most notable has been the\nrejection of the remuneration policy of GlaxoSmithKline, in particular, the package of its CEO, Jean-\nPierre Garnier (Foley, 2003). Predictions are being made that shareholders will, from now, actively\ntarget director\u2019s pay, with HSBC, ICI and Tesco reported as the next to undergo scrutiny over \u2018payment\nfor failure\u2019 in boardrooms (Griffiths and Wough, 2003). In fact, the \u2018first shot across HSBC\u2019s bows\u2019 has\nalready been fired with the public display of shareholder unease concerning HSBC\u2019s new board member,\nWilliam F. Aldinger III\u2019s three year, US$37.5 million package (Gibson, 2003). Although John Bond,\nHSBC\u2019s chairman, successfully defended Aldringer, such resentment is being directed towards\nlegislators, where, in particular, Patricia Hewitt, the UK\u2019s Trade and Industry Secretary, is currently\npreparing a paper on approaches to curbing excessive boardroom remuneration awards (Borrus and\nArndt, 2003).\n11\nOverall, the investor initiative to curb senior executive pay is gaining momentum (Borrus and Arndt,\n2003). Union and public pension funds are capitalising on investor irritation concerning inflated\nremuneration and bankruptcy-proof retirement executive packages, particularly in poor performing\ncompanies. Proxy based resolutions have made an impact on a number of large corporations, Delta, Bank\nof America, Norfolk Southern Corp, in terms of curbing excessive stock options and \u2018golden parachute\u2019\nseverance packages (Borrus and Arndt, 2003). Although shareholder resolutions are not binding on\nmanagement, the new willingness by mutual funds and other institutional investors to vote against\nmanagement is increasingly persuasive in requiring shareholder approval of CEOs pay and severance\npackages (Covlin, 2003).\nExecutive Incentives\nDespite the USA Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan, echoing continental European\ncounterparts in warning against stock-option excesses, the performance-based executive composition\npackage inclusive of incentive pay and stock options, has remained (Amihud and Lev, 1999). Further to\nthe inequities and the ensuing political repercussions, an additional reason for caution is the enhanced\npropensity to take risk, thus counteracting the \u2018natural\u2019 managerial tendency toward risk reduction\n(Amihud and Lev, 1999). The executive incentive for risk taking leads to increased mergers and\nacquisitions and above normal market earnings to shareholders which, in-turn, promote increased\nindividual earnings to executives with the danger of giving minimal attention to sustainable growth\n(Amihud and Lev, 1999). The assumption that the reduction of agency costs through the separation of\nownership and control can be mediated by the involvement of institutional investors and board\ncomposition, is being increasingly challenged (Amihud and Lev, 1999). Ever higher executive pay is not\nnecessarily the best way for reducing agency costs and, additionally, falls short of considering other\nstakeholders. Thus, executive share ownership and share option payments hold asymmetrical risk\nproperties according to the idiosyncratic response of each executive and the consequent different effects\non corporate resource allocation decisions (Table 5).\n12\nTable 5: Shares and Options\nFactors: Shares Share options\nPotentially most valuable when\nexercised during:\nPredictable market Volatile market\nDividend payments Yes No\nExpense against profit Yes No\nTaxation treatment Double taxation Tax benefit\nCEO behaviour Risk avoidance Risk taking, potential abuse\nSource: compiled by authors\nFor example, the Sanders (2001) study of 250 firms from Standard and Poor\u2019s 500 (S&P 500) which\nexamined the effects of ownership and option pay, reveals diametrically opposite effects on firm\nacquisition and divestiture propensity. In addition, the study shows that contextual characteristics\nmoderate the risk-seeking behaviour associated with ownership. Share options may be motivational as\nthey offer upside potential without imposing real downside risk on those who receive them in their\ncompensation plans (Sanders, 2001). Hence, options lead executives to take risks that shareholders\nmight otherwise avoid, as executives view the potential future payout associated with option pay as a\nform of compensatory lottery (Sanders, 2001). They engage in the acquisition, divestiture and other risk\nactivities and strategies to increase the probability that the share option compensation \u2018lottery\u2019 will pay\noff.\nAdditional to risk taking incentives is that the structure of the Anglo-American model of corporate\ngovernance favours hostile take-overs, thus threatening executive management\u2019s jobs as well as the jobs\nof employees. The impact of this model of efficiency achievement coupled with the drive to increase\nshareholder value acts to the detriment of employees, even if they manage to keep their jobs. The\naffected employees may perceive the prospect of acquisition and mergers, or even outsourcing, as being\ncontemporary \u2018serfdom\u2019; being sold-off, often with capital equipment, in a manner similar to land in\nImperial Russia being sold-off with its \u2018serfs\u2019 (Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 2001). With \u2018new ownership\u2019\nand \u2018new management\u2019, employees often feel that they have been betrayed to the principle of economic\nefficiency. Additionally, over time, executives can gain additional power by controlling the information\nrevealed to other stakeholders (Walsh and Seward, 1990). For example, the close relationship between\n13\nwarranted value and market value tests the ability of investors to ferret out appropriate information and\nprocess it quickly to arrive at pricing decisions (McTaggart et al, 1994). Thus, information concerning\nthe financial health of the organisation can be manipulated affecting the warranted value of a company\u2019s\nshares. Where the CEO is the founder or occupies the dual role of CEO and president, the strategic\nplanning and resource allocation processes (key institutional value drivers) may be unduly over\ninfluenced by that single executive (Bebchuk et al, 2002; Compb and Skill, 2003). With the increase of\nCEO influence emerges the propensity for excessive pay rises irrespective of stock performance\n(Bebchuk et al, 2002; Compb and Skill, 2003). The Compb and Skill (2003) study indicates that\nshareholders bear the cost of excessive pay when an executive has notable power. Such was the case with\nTyco\u2019s CEO and CFO who, in 2002, earned US$136 million and US$82 million respectively whilst the\ncompany\u2019s stock slid by 71%. However, Tyco is only one example of many (Table 6).\nTable 6: CEOs Compensation and Shareholders Return\nCompany Total CEO Compensation (2002)\nmillions\nShareholder Return (2002)\nApple Computers US$78.2 -34.6%\nLucent Technology US$38.2 (base salary) Plus package -75.4%\nSun Microsystem US$31.7 -74.7%\nTenet Health Care US$35.0 -58.1%\nJohn Hancock Financial\nServices\nUS$34.3 -31.7%\nSource: Burke and Schollser (2003)\nIt is interesting that at the time of emergent market decline, the 52 CEOs who laid off 1,000 workers\nor more took, on average, US$23.7 million, a full 80% more than the average CEO in the top 365 group\n(Longworth, 2001).

In contrast,\nsome of the more spectacular pay rises have occurred in the defence industry. The median CEO pay for\nthe 37 largest defence contractors including Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman,\nand General Dynamics, rose by 79% (Fig. 1; IPS\/UFFE, 2003). Median top executive pay was 45%\nhigher in 2002 at defence contractor enterprises than at the 365 large companies surveyed by Business\nWeek Magazine (IPS\/UFFE, 2003). The jump of USA defence contractors CEO pay far exceeded the\nincrease in defence expenditure, which rose 14% from 2001 to 2002 (IPS\/UFFE, 2003).\nFigure 1: Median CEO of USA\u2019s CEOs 2000-2002\n$6m\n$5m\n$4m\n$3m\n$2m\n$1m\nDefence contracter ten CEOs\nAll CEOs\n2000 2001 2002\n$5.4\n$3.7\n15\nSource: Adopted from IPS\/UFFE (2003)\nThe study also reveals that the size of political campaign contributions by the largest defence\ncontractors is strongly correlated with the value of defence contracts awarded to that company\n(IPS\/UFFE, 2003). The study indicates that 90% of the difference in contract size can be explained by\nsize of contribution (IPS\/UFFE, 2003). However, the entanglement of business and politics is not new.\nIntermingling was first revealed with the South Sea bubble collapse in August-September 1720, when a\nparliamentary inquiry found that the company books were largely fictitious and that many MPs and\ngovernment officials had accepted bribes from the company\u2019s directors (Paterson et al, 2003).\nRegulatory Response\nIn response to the South Sea scandal when company shares fell 84% from their peak, government\nenhanced the power of the newly formed Bank of England, which changed the running of the country\u2019s\nfinances (Paterson et al, 2003). In the USA, comparable state intervention has been pursued by both the\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Justice Department. On the issue of mergers, a more laissez-\nfaire position has been adopted as was the case with Microsoft (Becker, 2001). However, even when\nregulations are introduced, executives find ways to circumvent them (Table 8). For example, in 1993,\nafter considerable scrutiny of CEO pay, Congress changed the tax codes so that companies could not\ndeduct executive salaries from their tax bill if they exceeded US$1 million. This regulation did not\nreduce the growth of CEO pay but altered the structure of pay. Instead of high salaries, highly paid\nexecutives received increased grants of stock options. Because of accounting rules and practices these\noptions never reduced reported profit but instead reduced taxes when the options were exercised (Table\n9). For example, Cisco had received tax breaks sometimes exceeding its reported net income, whilst\nMicrosoft received a US$2.1 billion tax break as a result of exercised options (Henry et al, 2002).\n16\nTable 8: Regulations and Results\nInitiative Regulation initiated by\nCongress\nResults\n1989 Cap on \u2018golden\nparachute\u2019\nExcess tax on payments above\n2.99 times of base salary\n2.99 is the new minimum\nand company covers any\nexcess tax for executives\n1992 Disclosure of directors\npay\nBetter disclosure of CEOs pay Social comparison approach\n\u2013how much other CEOs\nreceive then try to get more\n1993 Cap on tax rebate on\nexecutive pay\nSalary over US$1 million to be\nnon-tax-exempt\nHuge stock option grants and\nupping of most salaries to \u00a31\nmillion.\nSource: compiled from Useem et al, (2003)\nTable 9: Tax Avoidance\nCorporation Pre-tax profit millions -\n1996-2000*\nFederal income tax\nmillion- 1996-2000**\nEnron 1785 -381 (rebate)\nColgate-Palmolive 1637 -21 (rebate)\nNavistar 1368 28 (payed)\n* Pre-tax USA profit is based on net domestic income.

However, options costs were typically not included in profit calculation\nwhen reporting to shareholders but included in preparation for tax. Although share-options are not the\nsolo culprit of business scandals, their high profile has attracted government attention. In response to\nEnron, Global Crossing, World Com, Tyco, and other accounting scandals, the USA government has\ninitiated a number of changes in accounting and taxation rules. In future, companies have to exercise\noptions as a cost (i.e. outstanding shares) at the time they are granted. As the challenge of valuing options\nremains arbitrary, for example, through using any of three available Black-Scholes methods for options\npricing, different results may emerge.\n17\nStakeholder Influence\nThe stakeholder perspective to corporate inter and intra-relations is concerned with the process of\nsocial engagement. The corporate relationship with society has a long history. For example, in the\nMiddle Ages, \u2018God\u2019 was considered a stakeholder or a corporate partner whose profits could be\ndistributed to the poor by the end of each year (Eberstadt, 1977). Even Smith\u2019s (1937) identification of\nexternal interests to the firm may be viewed as an early recognition of stakeholders. Barnard (1938)\nsuggested that employees are an important factor in a firm\u2019s success and their interests need to be\ncarefully assessed. Abrams (1951) identified four corporate claimants on the corporation - employees,\nstockholders, customers and the public, including government. It was Freeman (1984) who propounded\nStakeholder Theory emphasising the role and influence of an array of actors on the firm. Freeman (1984:\n46) defined a stakeholder as \u2018any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the achievement of\nan organisation\u2019s objectives\u2019, emphasising that organisations need to identify their direct and indirect\nstakeholders as well as their interests. Freeman (1984) defines the \u2018stake\u2019 that stakeholders have in the\ncorporation as equity, economic or influence based and the power that they wield is exercised through\nvoting. Irrespective of whether economic power or political power is adopted, influential stakeholders\npromote the notion of corporate obligation towards external social actors. Freeman (1984: 83) also\nsuggested that firms need to know \u2018what they stand for\u2019, through a value analysis process, in order to\nlook for congruency with stakeholders.\nTo date the adoption of stakeholder considerations in determining directors pay is limited to\neconomic considerations within the bounds of stakeholder models of governance, (Kakabadse and\nKakabadse, 2001; Kakabadse et al, 2001). However, within a globalising economic reality, stakeholder\ntheory needs to be canvassed from a broader socio-political context in order to be sensitive to global\nstakeholders (Bebchuk et al, 2002). Social contract thinking that builds on legal concepts of reciprocal\nrights and duties between parties is necessary, but not sufficient. What is required is consideration of a\nmuch broader set of relationships than the ones between an organisation and society (Donaldson and\nDunfee, 1994). Social contracts should also include the relationship between organisations and other\nsocieties and between societies. The emerging expectation for social responsibility through social\nreporting is an effort to aggregate various stakeholder information requirements and expectations. Social\n18\nreporting has its roots in the early 1940s. Interest was renewed in the 1970s as environmental\naccountability and, again, as social auditing in the 1990s, exemplified by certain Scandinavian and\ncontinental European firms moving towards more comprehensive corporate reporting thus culminating in\nthe present day corporate social responsibility movement (Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 2003).\nWood (1991: 693) defines corporate social responsibility as a \u2018business organisation\u2019s configuration\nof principles of social responsibility, processes of social responsiveness and policies, programs and\nobservable outcomes as they relate to the firm\u2019s social relationships\u2019. In his view, corporate social\nresponsibility starts with top management awareness of the need for corporate responsibility to\nstakeholder issues, which, in turn, leads to policy commitment and, ideally, ends with implementation at\nthe operational level. Towards this end the Integrative Social Contracts Theory (ISCT) (Donaldson and\nDunfee, 1994) provides for an understanding of stakeholder contracts at a macro-level. ISCT builds a\nbridge across a broad range of concepts of contract including the \u2018social contract\u2019 and business ethics. It\nexplains that a social contract is one that builds on the legal concept of reciprocal rights and duties\nbetween parties but encompasses a much broader relationship between an organisation and society and\nhow duties and rights involved in a social contract may be guided by both legal standards, such as\ncorporate law and agency regulation, as well as by social norms about what duties are and should be\nowed by the parties involved to each other (Donaldson and Dunfee, 1994). Many economies are\nintroducing legislation, which, in varying degrees, allows corporate boards to consider duties to\nstakeholders other than stockholders in the making of corporate decisions (Preston and Sapienza, 1990;\nPolonsky and Ryan, 1996). Thus, irrespective of the more cynical view that visible social involvement is\nsimply a means of insuring business legitimacy (Preston and Post, 1975; Davis, 1973; 1975), the\nchallenge remains of reconciling stakeholder demands, if for no other reason than the advantage to be\ngained from visible corporate responsiveness, and the creation of shareholder value, as two critical pillars\nthat support the deterring of unwelcome stakeholder attention to senior executive remuneration.\nNeed For a Geo-Political Approach\nRelationships between an enterprise and its stakeholders are dynamic, complex, and ever changing\n(Ackerman, 1975; Mahon, 1989). Empirical research suggests that awareness of and responsiveness to\n19\nexternal stakeholders and external issues has positive effects on both corporate social performance and\ncorporate economic performance (Miles, 1987; Clarkson, 1988; Frooman, 1997). Emerging evidence\nsuggests that corporations that are pro-active and accommodating in the management of stakeholder\nrelations perform better in terms of economic performance than those organisations that are reactive and\ndefensive (Clarkson, 1988; Frooman, 1997).\nSuch complexity of relationships and interaction falls in the remit of political theories of organisation,\nwhereby the firm is seen as a political coalition and executives as its primary political brokers (March\nand Simon, 1958; March, 1982). According to a political model, firm behaviour responds to the interests\nand beliefs of the dominant coalition. However, whilst organisations are ruled by political elites, or\ndominant coalitions, these elites do not last due to inter-elite conflicts that provide impetus for change\n(Selznick, 1957; Pareto, 1968: 176; Putman, 1976). These dynamics of political coalitions are central to\nunderstanding power in organisations and can help explain, for example, why succession is relatively\nindependent from firm performance (Donaldson and Preston, 1995). For example, a political model of\ncorporate governance can be perceived as an approach in which active investors seek to change corporate\npolicy by developing voting support from dispersed shareholders, rather than by simply purchasing\nvoting power and control (Pound, 1993). Shareholder activism, environmental lobby groups, changing\neconomic conditions, changing markets, emergence of employee ownership of stock and the growth of\nglobal corporations all give rise to the geo-political model of corporate governance (Kakabadse et al\n2001; Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 2001; 2003).\nChanging socio-economic contexts and an increased rise in democratic politics that foster an open,\ndecentralised process and full debate of alternative ideas will force corporations to maturely evolve in\nresponse to such developments (Pound, 1993). For example, an appreciation and understanding of the\npolitical marketplace is essential for the analysis of the role that the capital market mechanism plays in\ncorporate governance (Gundfest, 1993; Turnbull, 1997). As Bhide (1994:138) argues, \u2018good governance\nrequires real policy trade-off\u2019. Hence, corporate governance performance issues are related to a broader\npolitical context and, as such, can be understood from the geo-political perspective (Bebchuk, et al,\n2002).\n20\nWith the emergence of Japan as a world economic power, more than the 90% of all firms listed on\nthe Japanese stock market in 1988 had a scheme for employee stock option participation (ESOP) (Jones\nand Kato, 1993). Of the approximate 7,000 listed companies on the American stock exchange about\n1,000 firms are at least 10% employee held (Tseo, 1996) and the trend in Russia, where employee\nownership is higher than in the USA, (Blasi and Gasaway, 1993) raises the need for recognition of all\nstakeholders and the need for an extended strategic debate (Denham and Porter, 1995; Monks, 1996;\nTurnbull, 1997). However, ESOPs are no panacea. For a considerable number of firms, employee\nownership has had little effect on participation and governance (Pendleton, 2001), and, in fact, in certain\ncompanies has put the investment capital of workers at considerable risk (Blasi, 1988). Employee\nparticipation in governance has had more positive impact through the introduction of employee directors\nand employee shareholder communities. The presence of an employee type of director encourages\nbehaviour that is sensitive to the long term sustainability of the corporation (Covlin, 2003). For example,\nGeneral Mills Inc, matches the bonuses awarded to senior executives with its pension contribution on\nbehalf of its employees according to the year\u2019s performance in order to encourage long term thinking\n(Henry et al, 2002).\nWhether unionised or not, the right of workers to elect representatives who meet periodically to\nreview their company\u2019s HR polices, including executive compensation, training and development,\npensions and other benefits, as well as layoff provisions, is advocated by 70% of the surveyed workforce\nin USA (Kochan, 2002). The value of making boards accessible to employee representatives is illustrated\nby TIAA-CREF practice, the largest educational pension fund covering college professors, whose\nexample is being adopted by other organisation, such as airline companies (Kochan, 2002).\nBroadening Understanding of Remuneration\nAs relationships between firms and a broader range of stakeholders become more developed and\ncommonplace, the nature of their communication needs to take the form of a genuine dialogue\n(Frederick, 1994). It has to go beyond one-way communication and current measures of non-financial\nperformance, such as through Balanced Scorecard. Stakeholders will increasingly expect public\n21\ntransparency of the business and those who fail to comply with such public expectations will risk public\ncriticism and loss of reputation (Waddock and Graves, 1997).\nIn drafting a model of executive remuneration, incorporating broader stakeholder considerations,\nattention is given to agency, economic and socio-comparative theories that offer relevant insight as well\nas limitations in explaining director remuneration. Critical is the nature and relevance of incentives. The\nstrength of belief in the efficacy of agency theory thinking, strongly suggests that appropriate incentives\ninfluencing senior managers performance need to be in place in order to induce improved company\nperformance, (Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 2001). However, in order to account for broader stakeholder\nsentiment, these incentives need to be linked to broader socio-political factors that influence the\nenvironment in which the corporation and executives operate. These factors need to be inclusive of\nstakeholder relationships and corporate social and environmental responsibility issues. For senior\nexecutives to be more responsive to broader, globally located community issues, is particularly pertinent\ncurrently, as substantial changes are taking place in corporate and taxation rules and regulations as well\nas in other areas such as increased shareholder activism and the growing number of stakeholder driven\nnot-for-profit organisations (NGOs) and campaigning organisations, such as the World Development\nMovement (WDM), and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU). There is a\ngrowing need for further research to re-examine remuneration package instrument sensitivity to company\nperformance against corporate social responsibility performance and corporate responsiveness to local\nand global communities. Inclusiveness (who is included in democratic dialogue), procedural propriety\n(the basis on which the dialogue is designed and implemented), responsiveness (sensitivity of various\nparties to dialogue), and outcomes (what happens and who bears the associated costs and benefits) are\nkey indicators of corporate willingness to support responsible citizenship (Kakabadse and Kakabadse,\n2003; Zadek, 2003).\nTowards this end, a model of the components of director remuneration, accounting for geo-political\ninfluences, is presented (Fig. 2). The model allows for deliberative democratic processes, where all\nstakeholders can be involved in making collectively binding policy decisions. Policy proposals pursued\non the basis of self-interest, are unlikely to survive the scrutiny increasingly gaining momentum in a\nglobalising world. Encouraged are disclosure, bargaining and negotiation in the context of deliberative\n22\npolicy making. In practice, this means that all critical and interested stakeholders should have the same\nchance to define issues, dispute evidence and shape the agenda of one\u2019s own work within a context of the\ngovernors accepting to govern and be governed. The need is to move from a corporate control\nphilosophy, where employees can be treated as \u2018serfs\u2019 (Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 2001; Kakabadse et\nal; 2001) at the operational level, or as mercenaries owing no loyalty except to themselves and thus going\nto the highest bidder in the case of directors, to a philosophy of corporate citizenship, which, in turn,\nencourages development of a heightened awareness of the impact of business on society (Logan, 2000;\nZadek, 2003). The irony is, that through inducing greater stakeholder awareness, the philosophy and\npractice of shareholder value may be more effectively promoted. Through providing greater customer\nvalue through human resource strategies that encourage higher levels of commitment, a positive\nstakeholder environment is generated in the firm, thus realising higher levels of shareholder value\n(McTaggart et al, 1994). Yet, there is still some way to go as, even today, with an ever growing\nstakeholder awareness and greater legal safeguards, one in twenty workers in USA companies who vote\nfor the union can expect to be fired (Kochan, 2002). Terminology such as \u2018human resources\u2019, \u2018human\ncapital\u2019, \u2018talent\u2019 or \u2018employees\u2019 implies ownership of people by other people. \u2018Corporate citizen\u2019 implies\nmembership, loyalty and interdependency. The migration to a community philosophy to review corporate\ngovernance issues requires a re-definition of the role of the shareholder and the introduction of ideas of\ncorporate constitutions and corporate citizenship. It is likely that the encouragement of citizenship will\nalso \u2018bolster\u2019 current stakeholder remuneration practice, particularly concerning employee share option\nparticipation (ESOP) as a means to encourage active employee involvement in the affairs of the\ncorporation, or more broadly, the environment (McTaggart et al, 1994).\n23\nFigure 2: Geo-Politics of Director\u2019s Remuneration\nSource: compiled by authors\nConsidering that of the world\u2019s 100 largest economies, 50 are corporations (Handy, 1997) and that\ntransnational corporations and large, nationally-based enterprises are rapidly filling the political vacuum\npreviously occupied by nation states, the need for a geo-political perspective to better understanding all\naspects of governance in corporations, including director remuneration, is increasingly pressing. Dealing\nwith corporations as political institutions implies the need to apply the same rules as for a nation-state -\ndemocratic rights. Matters of human rights, free speech, the right to be informed, to a share of the\nproceeds of one\u2019s own work and that governors be socially and economically governed, are emerging\ncorporate issues. The need for greater disclosure with regard to potential conflicts of interests, regarding\ncorporate activities, client relationships, and other market sensitive news, as well as improvement in the\nquality, accuracy and relevance of financial information, are issues of equal critical importance.\nEnterprise has, after all, historically always been about a community of people.\nNegotiation\nSocial\nComparison\nPerspective\nEconomic - Market\nPerspective\nAgency\nPerspective\nRole\nExpectation\nDirector\nRemuneration\nStakeholder\nInfluence\nVisibility\nBenchmarks\nSocial Responsibility\n24\nReferences\nAbowd, J. and Kaplan, D.S.
