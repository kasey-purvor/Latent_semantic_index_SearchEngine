By using volume-weighted price indices, this paper analyzes price levels for a basket of prescription medicines and their differences in 15 OECD countries, including the United States and key European countries, the impact of distribution margins and generic entry on public prices and to what extent innovation, by means of introducing newer classes of medicines, contributes to price formation across countries. In doing so, the paper seeks to understand the factors that contribute to the existing differences in prices across countries, whether at an ex-factory or a retail level. The evidence shows that retail prices for branded prescription medicines in the United States are higher than those in key European and other OECD countries, but not as high as widely thought. Large differences in prices are mainly observed at an ex-factory level, but these are not the prices that consumers and payers pay. Cross-country differences in retail prices are actually not as high as expected and, when controlling for exchange rates, these differences can be even smaller. Product age has a significant effect on prices in all settings after having controlled for other factors. Price convergence is observed across countries for newer prescription medicines compared with older medicines. There is no evidence that originator brand prices fall after generic entry in the United States, a phenomenon known as the \u2018generics paradox\u2019. Finally, distribution and taxes are important determinants of retail prices in several of the study countries. To the extent that remuneration of the distribution chain and taxation are directly and proportionately linked to product prices this is likely to persist over time","downloadUrl":"https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/download\/pdf\/219439.pdf","fullTextIdentifier":"http:\/\/eprints.lse.ac.uk\/36351\/1\/Kanavos_Determinants_branded_prescription_2011.pdf","pdfHashValue":"b53b20dbdbfaf8caeaa3f40bb4fdbe9ddebdffd0","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","rawRecordXml":"<record><header><identifier>\n    \n    \n      oai:eprints.lse.ac.uk:36351<\/identifier><datestamp>\n      2013-09-02T07:54:27Z<\/datestamp><setSpec>\n      74797065733D4445505453:4C53452D5341<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n      74797065733D434F4C4C53:4C53455F435F454F<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n      74797065733D43454E54524553:4C53455F52435F3839<\/setSpec><\/header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/\" xmlns:dc=\"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/ http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc.xsd\" ><dc:relation>\n    \n      \n        http:\/\/eprints.lse.ac.uk\/36351\/<\/dc:relation><dc:title>\n        Determinants of branded prescription medicine prices in OECD countries<\/dc:title><dc:creator>\n        Kanavos, Panos G.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\n        Vandoros, Sotiris<\/dc:creator><dc:subject>\n        R Medicine (General)<\/dc:subject><dc:subject>\n        RA Public aspects of medicine<\/dc:subject><dc:subject>\n        RS Pharmacy and materia medica<\/dc:subject><dc:description>\n        This paper investigates the determinants of the prices of branded prescription medicines across different regulatory settings and health care systems, taking into account their launch date, patent status, market dynamics and the regulatory context in which they diffuse.

The evidence shows that retail prices for branded prescription medicines in the United States are higher than those in key European and other OECD countries, but not as high as widely thought. Large differences in prices are mainly observed at an ex-factory level, but these are not the prices that consumers and payers pay. Cross-country differences in retail prices are actually not as high as expected and, when controlling for exchange rates, these differences can be even smaller. Product age has a significant effect on prices in all settings after having controlled for other factors. Price convergence is observed across countries for newer prescription medicines compared with older medicines. There is no evidence that originator brand prices fall after generic entry in the United States, a phenomenon known as the \u2018generics paradox\u2019. Finally, distribution and taxes are important determinants of retail prices in several of the study countries. To the extent that remuneration of the distribution chain and taxation are directly and proportionately linked to product prices this is likely to persist over time.<\/dc:description><dc:publisher>\n        Cambridge University Press<\/dc:publisher><dc:date>\n        2011-06<\/dc:date><dc:type>\n        Article<\/dc:type><dc:type>\n        PeerReviewed<\/dc:type><dc:format>\n        application\/pdf<\/dc:format><dc:language>\n        en<\/dc:language><dc:identifier>\n        http:\/\/eprints.lse.ac.uk\/36351\/1\/Kanavos_Determinants_branded_prescription_2011.pdf<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>\n          Kanavos, Panos G. and Vandoros, Sotiris  (2011) Determinants of branded prescription medicine prices in OECD countries.

Background\nCross-country variations in the prices of prescription medicines have attracted\nconsiderable interest in recent years, both in the policy and the peer review\nliterature. Recent empirical evidence suggests that significant pharmaceutical\nprice differences exist between the United States and other countries (Con-\ngressional Budget Office (CBO), 2005, 2008), and that prices of patented pre-\nscription medicines are higher in the United States than in Canada or Europe.\nA study researching this became available in 1998 by the Committee on\nGovernment Reform and Oversight of the US House of Representatives as a\nminority staff report, reporting that drug prices in the United States were 72%\nhigher than in Canada and 102% higher than in Mexico. Two earlier studies by\nthe US General Accounting Office (GAO) using data from 1992 concluded that\nUS prices were 32% higher than prices in Canada and 60% higher than the\nprices in the United Kingdom (GAO, 1995, 1996). In the United Kingdom, the\nDepartment of Health submits regular reports to Parliament, which, among\nother things, provide a comparison of UK prices with those in other OECD\ncountries, as part of the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (PPRS); in the\n2009 PPRS report to Parliament, it was shown that US prices are 93% higher\nthan German prices and 112% higher than UK prices in 2008 at constant\nexchange rates (Department of Health, 2009).\nFurther empirical evidence from the peer review literature points at methodo-\nlogical issues of cross-national price comparisons and confirms price differences\nacross countries (Department of Health, 1997; Danzon and Chao, 2000a; Danzon\nand Towse, 2003; Danzon and Furukawa, 2003, 2008). Research has examined\nfactors such as price controls and patent policy affecting launch dates of new\npharmaceuticals among developed countries (Desiraju et al., 2004; Kyle, 2007;\nDanzon et al., 2005; Danzon and Furukawa, 2008) and developing countries\n(Lanjouw, 2005).\nThe evidence on whether US prices are higher than prices outside the United\nStates is, nevertheless, conflicting at times and is dependent on the mix of\nproducts used, the methods applied to compare their prices and the time period\nchosen. Danzon and Furukawa (2008), for instance, show that European\ncountries\u2019 prices were 6\u201333% lower than US prices, whereas the CBO, in a\nrecent study, showed that prices of pharmaceutical products could be lower in\nthe United States than in major European countries (CBO, 2005); this latter\nfinding was also supported by Kanavos et al. (2007). Roughead et al. (2007)\nfound that Australian prices for medicines that represent significant clinical\nadvances were similar to those paid under key US programs, despite funda-\nmental differences in the two countries\u2019 policy contexts, a finding which is also\nconfirmed by an earlier study (Australian Productivity Commission, 2001). In\nthe United Kingdom, the 2009 PPRS report to Parliament highlighted that\nalthough the 2008 weighted index of UK prices was significantly below than\n338 P A N O S G . K A N A V O S A N D S O T I R I S V A N D O R O S\nthose in the United States, this difference may have been exacerbated by\nexchange rate movements over time (Department of Health, 2009). Danzon and\nChao (2000a), however, suggest that certain studies comparing prices among the\nUnited States and other countries may be biased by unrepresentative samples\nand unweighted indexes and use Laspeyres price indices to compare cross-\ncountry wholesale pharmaceutical prices.\nThe entire discussion about price levels in the United States vs Europe and\nCanada has triggered intense debate about whether American patients might\nbenefit from lower prices for prescription medicines and whether products\nshould be subject to re-importation instead, thus by-passing the higher prices of\nlocally sourced products. One corollary of these empirical studies is that the\nUnited States could be paying a disproportionately high share of global phar-\nmaceutical R&D (McClellan, 2003), although this has been challenged else-\nwhere (Light and Lexchin, 2005; Light, 2009).\nThe above raise questions about the factors that contribute to or determine\ncross-country pharmaceutical price variability. Although a considerable body of\nempirical literature exists on cross-national differences in the prices of pre-\nscription medicines, and a stream of literature has emerged in the past few years\non the factors that determine prices in individual countries, little evidence exists\non the determinants of pharmaceutical prices across different regulatory set-\ntings. In addition, the literature does not fully explore the effect that factors such\nas competition pre- and post-patent expiry, the type of price regulation, the age\nof product and the type of cross-country price differences put together might\nhave on cross-country price differences in prescription medicines.\nThe objective of this paper is to investigate the determinants of originator\nbranded prescription medicine prices across different regulatory settings and\nhealth care systems, taking into account their launch date, patent status, market\ndynamics and the regulatory context in which they diffuse. In particular, this\npaper analyzes price levels for a basket of prescription medicines and their\ndifferences in 15 OECD countries (United States, Japan, France, Germany, Italy,\nSpain, United Kingdom, Australia, Mexico, Austria, Portugal, Sweden, Greece,\nSlovakia and Belgium), the impact of distribution margins and generic entry on\npublic prices and to what extent innovation, by means of introducing newer\nclasses of medicines, contributes to price formation across countries. In doing\nso, this paper seeks to understand the factors that contribute to the existing\ndifferences in prices across countries, whether at an ex-factory or a retail level.\nThe paper contributes to the debate on cross-national differences in the prices\nof prescription medicines and their determinants in a number of ways: first,\nmethodologically, individual country volume-weighted price indices are used\nto compare the prices of the basket of products across countries. Second,\nthe analysis focuses only on originator prescription medicines (both patent-\nprotected and patent-expired), thus recognizing that the dynamics of price\ndeterminants are different when generic medicines enter the market place; third,\nDeterminants of branded prescription medicine prices 339\nit provides a holistic approach to the determinants of prices, including compe-\ntition pre- and post-patent, the impact of supply-side regulation, product age,\nexchange rate variability and sales attrition due to switch to other products.\nFourth, the analysis is conducted over time rather than at a single point in time,\nthus allowing for dynamics. Finally, the basis of analysis is public prices of\nbranded prescription medicines, which are paid for by health insurers, rather\nthan list prices, which are often artificial prices.\nSection 2 discusses the conceptual framework in which this analysis takes\nplace. Section 3 outlines the data and methods employed in the analysis.\nFollowing that, section 4 presents the results of the analysis, whereas section 5\ndiscusses the key trends that are emerging. Finally, section 6 draws the main\nconclusions.\n2. Conceptual framework\nThe factors that influence pricing and the prices of prescription medicines are\ncomplex and have been investigated within the context of both pre-patent and\npost-patent expiry. Economic theory suggests that in regular markets, increasing\nentry and the resulting competition or the threat of entry may lead to lower\nprices. An important corollary is that when a second player enters a monopoly\nmarket, prices will drop. This is not necessarily the case in pharmaceutical\nmarkets. Factors influencing the nature of competition in pharmaceutical mar-\nkets include the effect of patent protection, patent expiry, advertising, pur-\nchasing by third-party payers and price or volume regulation.\nAn important potential determinant of pricing and of prices of prescription\nmedicines relates to market developments post-patent expiry. Empirical evi-\ndence from the United States suggests that generic entry leads to higher origi-\nnator prices and that a necessary condition for such price increases is that\ngeneric entry leads to a decline in the own-price elasticity of reduced-form\nbrand-name demand (Frank and Salkever, 1997), a phenomenon known as the\n\u2018generics paradox\u2019. Further empirical evidence from the United States suggests\nthat innovator firms do not attempt to deter generic entry through their pricing\nstrategies and this may lead to a significant reduction in market share of the\noriginator drug post generic entry (Grabowski and Vernon, 1986, 1996; CBO,\n1998); empirical evidence from Canada shows similar results (Lexchin, 2004).\nRather, innovator firms have continued to increase their prices at the same rate\nas before generic entry. Rizzo and Zeckhauser (2005) found that originator\nbrand prices do not decrease prices after generic entry, whereas Caves et al.\n(1991) concluded that generic entry only leads to a slowdown in the increase of\noriginator drug prices. Danzon and Chao (2000a) showed that generic com-\npetition would lower prices in less-regulated regimes, whereas Kanavos et al.\n(2008) suggested that regulation in pharmaceutical markets would result in\nprices of generic medicines not declining fast enough.\n340 P A N O S G . K A N A V O S A N D S O T I R I S V A N D O R O S\nAdvertising and advertising intensity also influence the choice of pharma-\nceutical products in an environment of product differentiation pre-patent expiry,\nwhere products are considered to be broadly comparable at the therapeutic class\nlevel, or substitutes. Empirical evidence suggests that advertising, by means of\ndetailing, has a powerful effect and systematically lowers price sensitivity\nbecause it increases brand loyalty, in addition to the effect of increasing a\nproduct\u2019s sales (Rizzo, 1999; Berndt et al., 2007), as well as having spillover\neffects, such that advertising by one firm in a therapeutic category increases\ndemand for other drugs in the same category (Berndt et al., 1995).\nA further important aspect that affects pharmaceutical prices is regulation of\npharmaceutical markets. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of\npharmaceutical regulation whether on the supply or the demand side (Kanavos\nand Costa-Font, 2005; Kanavos et al., 2008). Regulation includes interventions\non price through a variety of administrative measures, including the imposition of\nprice ceilings, the adoption of price cuts, as well as methods such as cost-plus\npricing, external price referencing and cost-effectiveness pricing. Assessing the\nrelative costs and benefits of new medicines in relation to existing alternatives has\nbeen increasing in influence in recent years as part of enabling policy-makers to\nreach informed decisions on the value of a new product and, through that on its\nprice, based on clinical and cost evidence (Sorenson et al., 2008; Kanavos et al.,\n2010, 2011a). Similarly, the uptake and use of external price referencing has\nincreased considerably over the past two decades as a means of restricting prices\nin a particular country to those selected from other countries (Espin et al., 2010).\nSome studies suggest that countries with strict price regulation of originator,\nin-patent pharmaceuticals have lower prices than countries with less strict\nregulation (Jo\u00a8nsson, 1994). Yet, it is not always clear what the effect of regu-\nlated or unregulated prices is on the overall cost of pharmaceutical products, as\nvolume must be accounted for. Recent findings indicate that the use of price\ncontrols, including external price referencing, has a statistically and quantita-\ntively important effect on the extent and timing of the launch of new drugs and\nthat price regulation in one country affects entry into other countries, and may\naffect the strategies of domestic firms (Kyle, 2007). In addition, imposing price\nceilings in regulated markets may even lower the price in unregulated markets\n(Mujumdar and Pal, 2005).\nInternal reference pricing, one form of reimbursement regulation affecting\npredominantly products or therapeutic classes characterized by patent expiries,\nhas attracted considerable attention in the last 15 years (Aaserud et al., 2009);\nin the Swedish context it has been shown to lead to a decrease in the market\nshares of particular originator products, suggesting higher levels of competi-\ntion (Aronsson et al., 2001). Grootendorst and Stewart (2006) drawing upon\nevidence from British Columbia found that the daily cost of drugs declined\nfollowing the introduction of reference pricing, but part of this reduction could\nbe attributed to factors other than reference pricing.\nDeterminants of branded prescription medicine prices 341\nSome studies have concluded that competition has kept prices low in markets\nwith less regulation, particularly in markets with patent-expired drugs. At least\nthree studies provide empirical evidence that generic competition is more effective\nin such countries (Danzon and Chao, 2000a; Magazzini et al., 2004; Kanavos\net al., 2008). Nevertheless, Danzon and Chao (2000a) state that comparing prices\nof pharmaceutical products across countries gives uncertain results due to the\ndifferences in products, prices and volumes. On the basis of empirical evidence\nfrom Norway, the introduction of a price index that aimed in lowering entry\nbarriers actually helped increase the market shares of generics and helped trigger\nprice competition by reducing overall market power (Dalen et al., 2006). This\npolicy measure may offer consumers the alternative of cheaper generics and,\ntherefore, help reduce spending. At times, the presence of regulation, for instance,\nin the form of a price index used in price setting, may indeed skew the market,\nleading to different effects than what would happen in the absence of regulation.\nAge, measured from the point of launching a new prescription medicine,1 is\nalso an important determinant of its price and may capture two effects; the first\nrelates to the innovative potential of the new medicine in relation to existing\ntherapeutic alternatives, such that if new medicines or classes of medicines\ndisplay improvements in their clinical profile compared with existing ones, they\nwill be priced at a price premium compared with those alternatives. Some\nregulatory authorities have mechanisms whereby the innovative potential of\nnew medicines is captured (O\u00a8BIG, 2007). It would be reasonable to assume that\ninnovation leads to higher prices. However, Berndt et al. (1992) found no evi-\ndence that product age had any impact on price indexes, but Danzon and Chao\n(2000b) found a steeper decline of price with drug age in regulated markets. The\nsecond effect is the product life-cycle effect and postulates that drug sales follow\na life-cycle pattern, increasing during a drug\u2019s initial years on the market,\npeaking and, eventually, declining; some evidence of that exists in the literature\nand concerns the anti-hypertensive market (Rizzo, 1999), but is unknown\nwhether it can be applied across the entire pharmaceutical market.\nOn the basis of the existing literature and in order to study the determinants of\noriginator branded prescription medicines, we consider a price determination\nfunction that aims to explain prices across different settings. In particular, origi-\nnator brand prices are set by profit-maximizing firms, taking the effects of com-\npetition, both pre- and post-patent expiry, regulation and the environment they sell\nin into consideration. This price determination function is depicted in equation (1):\nP \u00bc f \u00f0A;L;C; S;R\u00de \u00f01\u00de\nwhere price, P, is a function of the product\u2019s age, A, the life-cycle effects, L, the\nnature of competition, whether pre- or post-patent, C, the overall cross-country\ndifferences, S, and the nature of regulation and its intensity in individual markets, R.\n1 The concept of a \u2018new\u2019 prescription medicine includes products that could be combinations of two\nold drugs or a new formulation of an old drug, provided that additional therapeutic benefit can be shown.\n342 P A N O S G . K A N A V O S A N D S O T I R I S V A N D O R O S\n3. Data and methods\n3.1 Data\nPricing (both at an ex-factory and a retail level) and sales data for the 50 leading\noriginator branded prescription-only products by their worldwide sales and for\neach of 2004 and 2007 were used in this analysis, that is, a total of 100 branded\nproducts for the two years. The price data for these products were collected from\nnational official sources, whereas sales were acquired from Intercontinental\nMedical Statistics (IMS). This paper included 15 OECD countries, notably the\nUnited States, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, Australia,\nMexico, Austria, Portugal, Sweden, Greece, Slovakia and Belgium.\nThe study countries were selected, first, on the basis of the size of their\npharmaceutical market, ensuring a balance between large markets and smaller\nmarkets. The 10 largest markets included in the study sample accounted for\n80% of global prescription drug sales. A second criterion was geographical\nlocation (Europe, North America, Japan and Australia), whereas a third cri-\nterion was the variety of regulatory regimes for prescription medicines reflecting\ndifferent priorities in supply-side policies; the sample includes countries carrying\nout value assessments and negotiating pharmaceutical prices (e.g. France,\nSweden, Belgium, Australia, Italy and Japan), countries where pricing is by and\nlarge free (United States and Germany), countries having value assessments\ncombined with rate of return regulation (United Kingdom), or countries with\nminimal intervention (Mexico) and countries that pursue an administrative\ncontrol of pharmaceutical prices (Greece, Spain, Portugal, Slovakia and Austria).\nA summary of key policies affecting prices of originator pharmaceuticals in the\nstudy countries is provided in Table 1.\nThe selected sample of 100 products (50 products each for 2004 and 2007)\ncomprised a total of 68 unique molecules for both 2004 and 2007; 32 of these\nmolecules were common for 2004 and 2007, whereas 18 molecules were unique\nfor 2004 and a further 18 were unique for 2007. These 68 molecules were\ndrawn from across 19 therapeutic categories. On the basis of their three-digit\nAnatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification (three-digit), the 13 key\ntherapeutic classes were (a) proton pump inhibitors grouped with ranitidine (five\nmolecules); (b) statins (four molecules); (c) calcium antagonists and metoprolol\n(four molecules); (d) Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (one\nmolecule); (e) sartans (three molecules); (f) opioids (two molecules); (g) anti-epileptics\n(three molecules); (h) atypical anti-psychotics (five molecules); (i) Alzheimer\u2019s\n(two molecules); (j) anti-depressants (four molecules); (k) biguanides (three\nmolecules); (l) anti-bacterials for systemic use (five molecules); (m) drugs for\nobstructive airway diseases (five molecules); and (n) molecules from other\ntherapeutic categories (22 molecules). The 13 leading therapeutic categories in\nthe sample accounted for 67.65% of the molecules and over 78.81% of sales\n(measured in public prices) in 2007.\nDeterminants of branded prescription medicine prices 343\nTable 1.

Frequencies of update differ, but they are usually annual (Austria, Belgium, Greece, Mexico and Portugal), or occur only at launch\n(Italy, Spain, France and Slovakia). In France, Italy and Japan prices from the reference countries are used indirectly to inform the pricing process, whereas in all other coun-\ntries they are used explicitly. European Union (EU) countries\u2019 basket typically includes other EU countries; Mexico\u2019s basket comprises six countries where the product in\nquestion enjoys the highest sales penetration. In Japan, the basket of countries includes the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and France.\n6Owing to the way the system operates in Mexico, it is a combination of free pricing with international price comparisons with validation from countries that have the\nhighest penetration for the product under consideration.\nSource: The authors.\n3\n4\n4\nP\nA\nN\nO\nS\nG\n.\nK\nA\nN\nA\nV\nO\nS\nA\nN\nD\nS\nO\nT\nI\nR\nI\nS\nV\nA\nN\nD\nO\nR\nO\nS\nThese inclusion criteria resulted in more than 50% coverage of the total phar-\nmaceutical market in the study countries. The study countries also accounted for\nover 82% of the worldwide pharmaceutical market according to IMS.\nSeveral of the originator brands in both 2004 and 2007 had already faced\npatent expirations and generic entry. In particular, 28 brands in 2004 and 32\nbrands in 2007 were off-patent in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany,\nFrance, Italy and Spain. Of the 22 brands that were patent protected in 2004, 13\nwere also patent protected in 2007. Although a number of the originator brands\nin the sample were patent-expired, the objective of this paper was not to study\nthe prices or the price evolution of generics.\nIn order to ensure direct product comparability across countries, the most\nselling pack for each originator brand was identified and formed the basis for the\ncalculation of an ex-factory and retail price indices. Due consideration was\nexercised so that the dosage was common for each product across the sample of\ncountries. On average, the most selling pack represented 49% of the total brand\nsales in the study countries and in some cases it exceeded 80% of total brand\nsales. A price index approach was used to arrive at a country-specific composite\nprice for the selected product basket.\nBoth ex-factory and retail prices were used to study the retail segment, spe-\ncifically only products dispensed in the outpatient market. Product price data\nwere obtained from national official sources (see Table A1 in the Appendix),\nwhereas sales data for each corresponding product were obtained from IMS.\nPrices were taken for the first quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2007.\nPrices were adjusted for defined daily dose (DDD), as defined by the World\nHealth Organization (2008). Prices studied reflect the products\u2019 dispensing cost,\nregardless of whether health insurance covers the entire cost, or the patient has\nto pay a co-payment.\nThe retail prices in this paper reflect prices actually paid by health insurers,\nalthough it is not possible to capture any rebates given to public insurance bodies\non an ex-post basis. As we are studying originator brand prices only, it is thought\nthat the effect of such rebates on prices is small and that where they exist they\naffect generic products predominantly (Kanavos et al., 2009). In the United States,\nprices from the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) are used. FSS is a multiple award,\nmulti-year federal contract that is available for use by any Federal Government\nagency and satisfies all Federal contract laws and regulations. Pricing is negotiated\nbased on how vendors do business with their commercial customers and, there-\nfore, reflects discounting practices elsewhere in the system. FSS prices do not\ncapture the uninsured, who pay considerably higher prices.\n3.2 The empirical model\nIn order to empirically test the impact of different variables on the prices of\nprescription drugs we built an econometric model and applied panel data analysis.\nDeterminants of branded prescription medicine prices 345\nThe panel ID was therefore the molecule and the time variable was the year (one\nobservation in 2004 and one in 2007). On the basis of equation (1), the estimated\nmodels are in equations (2) and (3):\nPPi;t \u00bc bi \u00fe b0 \u00fe b1agei;t \u00fe b2agesq \u00fe b3genericsi;t \u00fe b4usi;t \u00fe b5uki;t \u00fe b6mexi;t\n\u00fe b7xri;t \u00fe b8htai;t \u00fe b9rpi;t \u00fe b10fpi;t \u00fe b11epr \u00fe b12classi;t \u00fe \u0002i;t \u00f02\u00de\nPEFi;t \u00bcbi \u00fe b0 \u00fe b1agei;t \u00fe b2agesq \u00fe b3genericsi;t \u00fe b4usi;t \u00fe b5uki;t \u00fe b6mexi;t\n\u00feb7xri;t \u00fe b8htai;t \u00fe b9rpi;t \u00fe b10fpi;t \u00fe b11epr \u00fe b12classi;t \u00fe ui;t \u00f03\u00de\nwhere i indicates the specific product in a specific country and t indicates time.\nPP is the log of the retail price and PEF is the log of the ex-factory price, adjusted\nfor DDD. Both ex-factory and retail prices were expressed in euros by using the\nend-of-year exchange rate for 2004 and 2007, respectively. The use of exchange\nrates to convert prices in different currencies into a common currency is justified\nby the fact that they reflect price movements across traded goods, including\npharmaceuticals, compared with purchasing power parities (PPPs), which are\nbetter suited to account for cross-country differences of non-tradables, such as\nhealth care services (Kanavos and Mossialos, 1999). age is the number of years\nsince the product\u2019s launch in a local market. It is determined as the number of\nyears (non-integral values) since the launch of each brand in each of the study\ncountries. agesq is the square of the age term and is included to allow for the\npossibility that sales will eventually decline with the number of years on the\nmarket, due to switch to other products. In doing so, it has been hypothesized\nthat drug sales would follow a life-cycle pattern. generics is a 0\u20131 dummy\nvariable which indicates the presence of generic competitors for the particular\nmolecule or not and is benchmarked against patent expiry for each brand and\nfor each of the study countries. Positive sales of a generic product indicate\ngeneric presence. This will show the effect of generic entry and presence on\noriginator prices. us, uk and mex are country dummy variables for the United\nStates, the United Kingdom and Mexico, respectively, which are included to\naccount for potential differences in prices in these countries compared with the\nother study countries arising from differences in (a) the way prescription med-\nicines are priced (free pricing in the United States, free pricing subject to rate of\nreturn regulation in the United Kingdom and free pricing subject to validation\nfrom countries with the highest product penetration in Mexico2) and (b) dis-\ntribution systems, whereby distribution arrangements in most countries remu-\nnarate wholesalers and pharmacists on the basis of fixed negotiated margins,\nexcept for the United States, the United Kingdom and Mexico, where flexible\nmargin policies exist. xr is a control variable capturing the effect of exchange\nrate movements. As prices are expressed in euros, xr is used to control for\n2 Which is distinct from both free pricing and external price referencing.\n346 P A N O S G . K A N A V O S A N D S O T I R I S V A N D O R O S\nchanges in the exchange rates and captures price movements attributable to\nexchange rate movements and volatility rather than nominal changes in prices.\nA number of regulatory dummy variables were also added to the model in order\nto determine the impact of regulation on prices. The impact of Health Technology\nAssessment (HTA) as a means of influencing prices is captured by the variable hta.\nHTA is explicitly used to inform pricing decisions in Australia, France, Belgium\n(only in 2007), Sweden and the United Kingdom. rp indicates the presence of\ninternal reference pricing as a regulatory measure. This is present in Australia,\nBelgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Slovakia. fp indicates free\npricing for pharmaceuticals, present in Germany, Japan, Sweden, the United\nKingdom and the United States and indicates the absence of explicit regulatory\nintervention to set prices administratively. epr indicates the presence and explicit use\nof external price referencing in price setting in Spain, Austria, Portugal, Greece,\nSlovakia and Belgium. class indicates a dummy variable for each therapeutic class;\nthe definition of therapeutic classes was based on diagnosis and the three-digit ATC\nclassification. A definition and description of all variables is shown in Table 2.\nIn estimating equations (2) and (3), we have used random effects panel data\nanalysis. The Hausman test suggests that it is preferable to follow the random\neffects approach because the x2 statistic is 0.49, indicating that the difference\nbetween the consistent fixed effects and the random effects estimator is statistically\ninsignificant. The random effects approach assumes that the intercepts of the\nindividual variables are different but that they can be treated as drawings from a\ndistribution with mean m and variance sa\n2. The essential assumption here is that\nthese drawings are independent of the explanatory variables (Verbeek, 2005).\n4. Results\n4.1 Descriptive analysis: price comparisons across countries\nAn analysis of cross-country price differences reveals interesting results, which\nare summarized in Figures 1\u20135. A sub-sample of the study countries has been\nused to highlight the points raised in Figures 1\u20135, as all others usually follow\npricing developments in the highlighted countries. In order to compare prices\nacross countries, country-based (weighted) price indices have been created, both\nfor ex-factory and for public prices, the latter reflecting prices paid for by health\ninsurers. Clearly, weights vary across countries in order to reflect local market\nshare patterns. The price index we have created takes into account product\nmarket shares in each country, but not absolute levels of consumption, as the\nlatter would bias the results, leading to higher prices for countries with higher\ndrug consumption. For this purpose, the weights used are volume-adjusted on a\ncountry-by-country basis; to that end, each drug\u2019s (volume-based) market share\nis taken into account in building a country\u2019s price index. For the calculations\nshown in Figures 1\u20135, the weighted average in the five largest European Union\nDeterminants of branded prescription medicine prices 347\nTable 2.

The\ndifference in ex-factory prices between the United States and Europe is over\n200% in 2007, whereas the same difference for public prices was 24% in 2004\nand 63% in 2007 and is shown to be even smaller between the United States on\nthe one side and the United Kingdom or Germany on the other. Price differences\nappear to have increased in 2007 compared with 2004.\nAn important aspect when comparing prices across countries is related to\nexchange rate variability. Exchange rate fluctuations may have a significant\nimpact on ex-factory and public prices across countries. US ex-factory prices\nhave increased by 19% compared with European prices between 2004 and 2007\nfor the sample basket. Exchange rate fluctuations have contributed to this dif-\nference by about a third (or 32%); US public prices, have risen faster (31%).\nBetween 2004 and 2007, US ex-factory prices have increased by 11% com-\npared with European prices for 13 branded, in-patent products on the market;\nthis rises to 22% if exchange rate changes are taken into account; US public\nprices for the same products have risen faster than G5 public prices (114% or\nTable 2.

Ex-factory\nprices of brands whose patent has expired have risen faster in the United States\nthan in Europe between 2004 and 2007 (158% or 175% if exchange rate\nchanges are considered); public prices have also risen faster in the United States\nthan in EU G5 (194% or 114% if exchange rate changes are considered).\nSecond, off-patent drugs are widely perceived as cost containment targets. Yet, the\nway the off-patent segment performs differs across countries. European countries\ntypically regulate reimbursement; an important component of reimbursement policy\nis internal reference pricing (either at molecular or\/and therapeutic class level),\nwhich, in addition to capturing competition and price decreases among generics, it\ncan also lead to downward pressure of off-patent originator brands. This is not\nnecessarily the case in the United States where generic competition can lead to a\nsteep decline in generic prices, but can leave off-patent originator brands unaffected.\nThis is captured in Figure 2, which highlights the price spread between the United\nStates and some of the other study countries for both in-patent and off-patent drugs.\nPrices of in-patent brands increased in the United States by 13% compared with EU\n257\n100 114 107 92 86\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\nUS\nA G5 UK\nGe\nrm\nan\ny\nFra\nnc\ne\nIta\nly\nSp\nain\nEx- factory Price 2004 \n124\n100 111 106 97 92\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n180\nUS\nA\n(FS\nS) G\n5\nGe\nrm\nan\ny\nIta\nly\nSp\nain UK\nFra\nnc\ne\nPublic Price 2004 \n306\n100 105 117 97 86\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\nUS\nA G5 UK\nGe\nrm\nan\ny\nFra\nnc\ne\nIta\nly\nSp\nain\nEx-factory Price 2007\n163\n100\n125\n95 89 94\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n180\nUS\nA\n(FS\nS) G\n5\nGe\nrm\nan\ny\nIta\nly\nSp\nain UK\nFra\nnc\ne\nPublic Price 2007\n85\n96\n92\n97\nFigure 1.

However, the spread is significantly\nhigher in the case of originator brands whose patents expired in 2007 compared\nwith 2004 (94% increase between 2004 and 2007) suggesting a divergence in\npolicies between the United States and EU G5 or other countries (panels c and d). It\nalso highlights the existence of the generics paradox in the United States namely that\nthe prices of off-patent brands in the sample seem to be increasing in 2007 rather\nthan decreasing, compared with 2004.\nThird, it is important to stress that distribution margins and taxes are critical\ncomponents of pharmaceutical expenditure and can generate a distortion when\ncomparing prices internationally. In some countries the combined effect of VAT,\nwholesale and retail margins is significantly higher than in others, impacting the\nproportion of the retail price directed to manufacturers.

UK retail prices are now lowest (compared with being the\nsecond highest at ex-factory level), as the impact of distribution margins and taxes\nhas had a significant upward effect on retail prices in France Italy and Spain.\nFourth, age of the therapeutic class may help explain international price\ndifferences. Figure 4 shows the average price per therapeutic class ranked by\nlaunch date. Prices in 2007 are considered for EU G5, United States, Mexico,\nJapan and Australia, across 10 key therapeutic classes. There appears to be a\nsignificant positive correlation between the age of the therapeutic class and price\ndifferences. The longer the therapeutic class has been on the market, the greater\nare the price differences between highest and lowest prices. This figure shows\nthat there are smaller price differences across countries for new drugs and that,\noverall, there appears to be some price convergence over time across major\ncountries. In some price-regulated countries, this could partly be explained by\nthe use of external price referencing as a method of pricing new medicines\nand the resulting launch sequencing strategies of manufacturers who launch\nproducts in unregulated or less-regulated markets first.\nFifth, age of a product appears to be an important determinant of drug price\ndifferences. New drugs coming into the market can be considered to be innova-\ntive. Clearly, not all new drugs are innovative and the link between \u2018new drugs\u2019\nand \u2018innovative drugs\u2019 is not a linear one, but it is also the case that the perception\nFigure 5.

Figure 5\nexamines ex-factory drug price differences across EU G5 countries in 2007. There\nappears to be a significant link between product age and price differences across\ncountries. The more recent the market entry is, the smaller are the drug price\ndifferences across countries. For older drugs, prices differ significantly. In addi-\ntion, the lowest prices appear to be rising for newer drugs and the highest prices\nseem to be decreasing for newer drugs, suggesting an overall price convergence.\n4.2 Results of the econometric analysis\nFour different specifications are estimated for each of the models shown in\nequations (2) and (3). In the first specification age, agesq, generics, xr and the\ncountry dummies are used as explanatory variables. The second specification\nalso includes therapeutic class dummies. The third specification introduces all\nthe regulatory dummies (hta, rp, fp and epr) but excludes class dummies, while\nthe fourth specification includes all explanatory variables.\nResults for the model in equation (2), outlining the determinants of public\nprices, can be found in Table 3. In the first specification, including only the\neffects of age, generic entry and exchange rates as well as country dummies, us,\nmex and xr have a positive and statistically significant coefficient at a51%. age\nhas a negative and significant effect on prices, as expected. The coefficient of\ngenerics is statistically non-significant. When also including therapeutic class\ndummies as control variables (Model 2), results are very similar to Model 1. In\nthe third specification, which introduces policy variables, age has again a\nnegative effect on public prices (statistically significant at a5 1%). hta has a\nnegative and significant coefficient: Countries that explicitly use HTA have on\naverage lower prices by 16.2%, compared with those that do not use HTA. fp\nhas a positive and significant coefficient: Countries which have free pricing have\non average higher prices by 26.4% (statistically significant at a51%); this\nprimarily reflects the situation in the United States and Germany. rp and epr are\nstatistically not significant. The us dummy has a statistically non-significant\ncoefficient in this model; it is very likely that the us and fp dummies interact in\nthis case. mex has a positive and significant coefficient, while uk has a negative\nand significant coefficient, indicating that when controlling for other factors,\nMexican public prices are on average higher than other countries in the sample,\nwhile UK public prices are lower on average. generics has a positive but sta-\ntistically non-significant coefficient. This means that generic presence does not\naffect the price of the originator, a phenomenon studied before and known as\nthe \u2018generics paradox\u2019 (Frank and Salkever, 1997).

Results do not\nchange in Model 4 (which includes both policy and class dummies) compared\nwith Model 3.\nAs in the model depicted in equation (2), results for equation (3) appear to be\nrobust across different specifications. Results suggest that newer classes of\nprescription medicines are more expensive than older classes based on their\nrespective launch year. This is a finding that is present in all four specifications\nfor both public and ex-factory prices. Prices in the United States appear to be\nhigher than in other countries. The effect is not that obvious for public prices,\nwhere the difference can be non-significant and up to 28.8% when significant.\nThe difference depends on the control variables included in the model. However,\nwhen it comes to ex-factory prices, US prices are between 72% and 99.2%\nhigher, depending on the control variables included in the model. These results\nshow that although there are significant price differences between the United\nStates and other countries when considering ex-factory prices, these differences\nare much lower for public prices. Generic presence does not appear to sig-\nnificantly affect public prices of originator prescription medicines in any of the\nincluded model specifications.\nFinally, Table 5 demonstrates the empirical evidence that emerges from a sub-\nsample of the total sample, notably the determinants of public prices in that part of\nthe sample comprising genericized originator prescription medicines.

Discussion and policy implications\nIn this paper we have used a representative sample of originator branded pre-\nscription medicines to analyze the determinants of their prices and price changes\nacross 15 OECD countries. Any potential biases occurring due to generic medicines\nand formulations and the different dynamics of the generic market, are avoided as\ngenerics are excluded. By using data at two different points in time, further insights\nare obtained on how product age, pharmaceutical price regulation and competition\nimpact on prices of originator (in- and off-patent) branded prescription medicines.\nBoth ex-factory and public prices are considered in the analysis. The inclusion of\npublic prices is of great significance, as these are the prices that health insurers or\nconsumers have to pay; consequently, assessments of affordability and cost con-\ntainment unavoidably focus on this particular price.\nImportant findings have emerged from the analysis presented in this paper. First,\nalthough the price spread in older therapeutic categories used to be significant across\ncountries, the same spread has narrowed down significantly for newer therapeutic\nclasses; thus, price convergence is observed over time. Second, cross-country price\ncomparisons are only meaningful if the right prices are compared in each case.\nTherefore, different studies may show different results, if prices across countries are\nnot selected carefully. In this paper, we have demonstrated how significant price\ndifferences are when ex-factory prices are compared and how these differences\nnarrow down significantly when public prices are compared across countries. Third,\nit seems that price differences between the United States and Europe have been\nexaggerated. Indeed US prices are higher than European prices, but not at the extent\nthat is usually perceived. A very important aspect is that comparison of ex-factory\nprice differences between United States and Europe can be meaningless as they do\nnot reflect what health insurers pay in the United States.\nTable 5.

K A N A V O S A N D S O T I R I S V A N D O R O S\nFourth, cross-country public price differences and cross-country ex-factory\nprice differences are not the same. This highlights, among other things, the\nimportance of distribution as a key contributor to public prices of prescription\nmedicines, by default, as a contributor to the cost incurred by health insurance.\nThe fact that in many cases distribution margins are regulated and directly (at\ntimes proportionately) linked to the prices of medicines further exacerbates this\nsituation. Fifth, off-patent originator brands account for a significant proportion\nof the price variation between United States and Europe; differences in generic\npolicies between Europe and the United States and more intensive intervention in\nfour of the five largest European countries (Germany, France, Italy and Spain),\nwhich encompasses originator brands, can explain the significant increase in the\nprice spread between the United States and Europe (G5). This is also a demon-\nstration of the existence of the generics paradox, particularly in the United States,\nwhere prices of off-patent originator brands do not decline post-patent expiry, but,\nrather, increase faster than prices of in-patent originator brands. Again, this finding\nis a reflection of developments in the study sample between 2004 and 2007 (and\nmight be the same or different in a wider range of off-patent originator brands),\nbut is in contrast with developments in public prices of in-patent originator brands,\nwhere differences between the United States and EU G5 are significantly smaller.\nSixth, product age is an important determinant of drug price differences. Newer\nproducts or classes of products are on average higher priced than older (classes of)\nproducts across all settings after having controlled for other factors. This is also\nconfirmed by other recent work where one of the explanations offered for price\nincreases is the lack of competition due to lack of therapeutically equivalent drugs\n(GAO, 2009). Upward convergence is also observed over time, which can result\npartly from explicit use of cross-country price referencing. Seventh, as shown\nwithin the European context, distribution and taxation can contribute significantly\nto the total cost of prescription medicines that health insurers pay. This cost varies\nwidely and relates to significant differences across countries in the rates of payable\nVAT (e.g. 19% in Germany vs 2% in France and 0% in the United Kingdom), to\ndifferences in the way the distribution chain is remunerated or\/and is allowed to\noperate; for instance, there is a fragmented wholesale and retail market structure\nwith high, but regressive, margins in France and Italy, a less fragmented\nwholesale and retail market structure with flat rates in Germany or a liberalized\nwholesale and retail market structure in the United Kingdom with extensive\nhorizontal and vertical integration combined with fixed fees per prescription\ndispensed and the opportunity to negotiate prices and discounts with manu-\nfacturers. Although a detailed discussion of taxation and distribution are outside\nthe scope of this paper, the above differences are indicative of the reward\nstructures in the overall pharmaceutical supply chain with analysis conducted\nelsewhere (Kanavos et al., 2011b).\nThe evidence that has emerged from this paper has a number of policy impli-\ncations. First, when conducting cross-national comparisons of prescription drug\nDeterminants of branded prescription medicine prices 361\nprices it is important to know what prices are compared and to ensure that such\ncomparisons use the same denominator across countries. Misperceptions often\noccur about price levels across countries, particularly when list prices are confused\nwith public prices. List prices coincide with public prices in European countries, but\nthis is not the case in the United States. In this context, price differences between\nUnited States and Europe are not as extensive as originally thought.\nSecond, it is important to recognize the strategic importance of the compo-\nnents of drug prices across countries. One important factor that contributes to\nprice differences across countries is taxation, through the imposition of a sales\ntax or VAT. Different approaches to taxation suggest that there is no economic\nrationale for imposing sales taxes or VAT on prescription medicines, other than\ntaxing resources devoted to the health care budget. A further factor influencing\nprices is the contribution of the distribution sector, both wholesale and retail.\nOverall, the paper has shown that a significant component of the prices that\nhealth insurers pay relate to taxation and distribution costs and this could result\nin resource misallocation. Overall, public prices are totally different from ex-\nfactory prices and the former reflect the rewards to the entire pharmaceutical\nvalue chain, while the latter are not representative of reality.\nThird, the cross-country price spread for newer therapeutic categories or,\nindeed, products, is significantly lower than that for older therapeutic categories\nor products. As we move towards newer molecules over time by launch date,\nthere is upward price convergence across the study countries overall. This\nis partly explained by external price referencing and the launch sequence for\nnew products, whereby new products are first launched in less-regulated\ncountries followed by price-regulated countries. This launch sequence influences\nin part the final price in price-regulated countries. In addition, considering that\na significant proportion of the study countries are implementing some form\nof regulation on originator drug prices this finding challenges the arguments\nthat the United States is bearing a significant part of the R&D burden compared\nwith other regions.\nFourth, the price spread between in-patent originator brands in the sample is\nsmaller compared with the same spread between off-patent originator brands in\nthe same sample, both over time and between Europe and the United States; a\nsignificant proportion of the price variation in originator brands across countries\nis accounted for by changes in the off-patent originator brand segment; prices in\nthat segment rise significant in the United States and decline overall in Europe,\nconfirming the generics paradox in the United States and the associated policy\nimplications.\nFifth, having controlled for other factors, the statistical significance of product\nage suggests that newer medicines or classes of medicines are rewarded with a\npremium over older treatments across all settings. Again, this challenges the\nargument that if innovation exists in newly introduced treatments, it is poorly\nrewarded outside the United States.\n362 P A N O S G . K A N A V O S A N D S O T I R I S V A N D O R O S\nThe analysis is not without limitations. First, there is no available data on\nadvertising, for example in the form of expenditure in detailing, to test its\nimpact on prices, although a recent systematic review has shown that adver-\ntising influences prescribed volume (Spurling et al., 2010). Besides, the inclusion\nof the US dummy captures any unexplained heterogeneity surrounding direct to\nconsumer advertising as this is the only country in the sample where it is\nallowed. Second, whereas the sample of products selected has a significant\nbudget impact and accounts for a significant proportion of total originator\nbranded prescription pharmaceuticals in the study countries, it may be the case\nthat outliers may exist in terms of products that are sold in in-patient settings,\nwhich are highly specialized (e.g. vaccines or oncology products) and for which\nthe pricing arrangements may be different. While this paper explores pricing\ndeterminants in the pharmacy market, an obvious extension would be to study\npricing developments in the in-patient sector. Finally, while we have exhausted\nall possibilities to include prices actually paid by health insurance, it is not\npossible to account for any hidden rebates given from manufacturers to health\ninsurers. As the subject matter is originator brand prices, it is thought that the\nimpact of such rebates is limited.\n6. Conclusions\nIn this paper, we have investigated the determinants of prices of originator branded\nprescription medicines across different regulatory settings and health care systems,\ntaking into account their launch date, patent status, market dynamics and the\nregulatory context in which they diffuse. Volume-weighted price indices have been\nused to analyze price levels for a basket of prescription medicines and their dif-\nferences in 15 OECD countries, the impact of distribution margins and generic\nentry on public prices and to what extent innovation, by means of introducing\nnewer classes of medicines, contributes to price formation across countries.\nThe evidence shows that differences in ex-factory prices for branded origi-\nnator prescription medicines between the United States and other countries,\nparticularly key European markets, are significant, but these are not the prices\nthat health insurers pay. By contrast, public price differences have been exag-\ngerated and are not as high as originally thought. At public price level, differ-\nences between the United States and other countries, particularly Europe, are\ngreatest for off-patent originator brands and significantly lower for in-patent\noriginator brands. Exchange rate movements and volatility can exacerbate such\ndifferences and international comparisons should be treated with caution.\nProduct age has a significant effect on originator brand prices in all settings after\nhaving controlled for other factors. Price convergence is observed across\ncountries for newer compared with older originator brands and this could be\npartly attributed to the extensive use of external price referencing. Originator\nbrand prices do not necessarily fall after generic entry and may actually increase,\nDeterminants of branded prescription medicine prices 363\na phenomenon known as the \u2018generics paradox\u2019 and prevalent chiefly in the\nUnited States. Finally, distribution and taxes are important determinants of\npublic prices in several of the study countries, having a significant impact on the\ncost of prescription medicines to health insurers and affecting the overall payoffs\nfor the different stakeholders in the pharmaceutical supply chain.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are grateful to Andrew Jack, Chris Muris, Paul DeNijs, Kees de\nJoncheere and two anonymous referees for very useful comments and suggestions.\nFabio Mainieri and Meg Casson provided excellent research assistance.
