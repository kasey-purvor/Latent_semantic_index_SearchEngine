Accurately mapping the location of ionospheric\nbackscatter targets (density irregularities) identified by the\nSuper Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) HF radars\ncan be a major problem, particularly at far ranges for which\nthe radio propagation paths are longer and more uncer-\ntain. Assessing and increasing the accuracy of the map-\nping of scattering locations is crucial for the measurement of\ntwo-dimensional velocity structures on the small and meso-\nscale, for which overlapping velocity measurements from\ntwo radars need to be combined, and for studies in which Su-\nperDARN data are used in conjunction with measurements\nfrom other instruments. The co-ordinates of scattering loca-\ntions are presently estimated using a combination of the mea-\nsured range and a model virtual height, assuming a straight\nline virtual propagation path. By studying elevation angle\nof arrival information of backscatterred signals from 5 years\nof data (1997\u20132001) from the Saskatoon SuperDARN radar\nwe have determined the actual distribution of the backscatter\ntarget locations in range-virtual height space. This has al-\nlowed the derivation of a new empirical virtual height model\nthat allows for a more accurate mapping of the locations of\nbackscatter targets.\nKeywords. Ionosphere (Active experiments; Wave propaga-\ntion; Instruments and techniques)\n1 Introduction\nCoherent scatter radars are one of the most successful instru-\nments used for probing dynamical processes in the Earth\u2019s\nionosphere. They measure the motion of magnetic field-\naligned ionospheric density irregularities in the ionospheric\nE- and F-regions which act as backscatter targets for the\ntransmitted radio signals. One necessary condition for the\nCorrespondence to: G. Chisham\n(gchi@bas.ac.uk)\nproduction of coherent backscatter is that the wave vector of\nthe radio signal is propagating orthogonal to the Earth\u2019s mag-\nnetic field at the point of scatter (Bates and Albee, 1970). For\nultra high frequency (UHF) and very high frequency (VHF)\nradio signals, refraction of the signal is generally weak or\nnonexistent and signal propagation in the Earth\u2019s ionosphere\nis generally along straight line paths. At low and middle lat-\nitudes these rectilinear rays are highly suitable for studying\nthe ionosphere (especially the E-region ionosphere where it\nis easier for these rays to achieve orthogonality with the mag-\nnetic field). However, at high latitudes where the magnetic\nfield becomes increasingly vertical, it becomes progressively\nmore difficult for rectilinear rays to achieve orthogonality\nwith the Earth\u2019s magnetic field, especially at higher altitudes\nsuch as in the F-region ionosphere. In contrast to UHF and\nVHF signals, high frequency (HF) radio signals are very sus-\nceptible to refractive effects (Weaver, 1965), and hence, vari-\nations in ionospheric electron density play a major role in HF\npropagation. Consequently, measurements of irregularities\nin the high-latitude ionospheric F-region are best made by\nradars which transmit in the HF range (3\u201330 MHz), where\nthe refraction of signals by the ionosphere allows them to\nachieve orthogonality with the Earth\u2019s magnetic field over a\nwider range of altitudes, and hence, to backscatter off field-\naligned density irregularities in both the E- and F-region\nionosphere.\nThe Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN)\n(Greenwald et al., 1995) is a network of ground-based\ncoherent-scatter radars that operate in the HF band and\nwhose fields of view combine to cover extensive regions\nof both the Northern and Southern Hemisphere polar iono-\nspheres. Over the last decade SuperDARN has been\none of the most successful tools for studying high-latitude\nplasma convection and large-scale dynamical processes in\nthe Earth\u2019s magnetosphere, ionosphere, and upper atmo-\nsphere (Chisham et al., 2007). This wide range of scien-\ntific studies is made possible because the F-region density\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n824 G. Chisham et al.: SuperDARN virtual height model\nirregularities that act as backscatter targets drift with the\nbackground plasma motion (Villain et al., 1985; Ruohoniemi\net al., 1987). Hence, when irregularities are present, Super-\nDARN can image ionospheric convection across the polar\nionospheres.\nEach SuperDARN radar is an electronically-steerable,\nnarrow-beam, phased-array radar that comprises a main ar-\nray of 16 log-periodic antennae. The standard 16-beam scan\nemployed by the radars creates individual fields of view that\ntypically extend \u223c52\u25e6 in azimuth, and from \u223c200 km to\nmore than 3000 km in range. The SuperDARN radars are\nfrequency agile and can operate over a wide range of HF\nfrequencies (from 8 to 20 MHz). This frequency can be ad-\njusted to find the best propagation paths to irregularity re-\ngions where the signals can be backscattered. The radars\ntransmit a multi-pulse sequence and the backscattered sig-\nnals (or echoes) they receive are sampled and processed to\nproduce multi-lag complex autocorrelation functions (ACFs)\nat all ranges. The ACFs are fitted by standard functions to\nestimate the backscattered power, the line-of-sight Doppler\nvelocity of the irregularities, and the width of the Doppler\npower spectrum for each range where there are significant\nreturns (Hanuise et al., 1993; Baker et al., 1995). In addition\nto the main antenna array, many SuperDARN radars have an\ninterferometer array of 4 antennae, located some distance ei-\nther in front of, or behind, the main array. Determination of\nthe cross-correlation function (XCF) of the signals received\nat the main and interferometer arrays allows the measure-\nment of the phase difference between the backscattered sig-\nnals measured by the two arrays. Knowledge of this phase\ndifference allows the determination of the elevation angle of\narrival of the backscattered signals (Milan et al., 1997; Andre\u00b4\net al., 1998). However, the range of measurable elevation an-\ngles is limited by the 2pi ambiguity of the phase measure-\nments and depends on the operational frequency and the dis-\ntance between the two antenna arrays.\nOne of the most important aspects of SuperDARN data\nanalysis is mapping the locations of the scattering regions,\nspecifically determining their geographic\/geomagnetic co-\nordinates. The required accuracy of this mapping depends\non the application of the measurements. The resolution of\nfeatures in convection maps determined using large-scale Su-\nperDARN global convection mapping is typically limited to\nhundreds of km and hence, small uncertainties in mapping\nhave little influence on these convection maps. However, as-\nsessing and increasing the accuracy of this mapping is crucial\nfor the following types of investigation:\n\u2013 Studies of small and meso-scale velocity structures,\nwhere overlapping velocity measurements from two Su-\nperDARN radars need to be combined to determine\ntwo-dimensional velocity vectors (e.g. Huang et al.,\n2000; Chisham et al., 2000).\n\u2013 Comparisons between measurements from SuperDARN\nand space-based instruments, e.g. auroral images,\nDMSP particle precipitation measurements, etc. (e.g.\nChisham et al., 2005; Hubert et al., 2006).\n\u2013 Comparisons between measurements from SuperDARN\nand other ground-based instruments, e.g. EISCAT,\nSPEAR, etc. (e.g. Woodfield et al., 2002; Senior et al.,\n2004).\nAccurate mapping of scattering regions requires knowledge\nof the HF signal propagation paths. The propagation paths of\nsignals backscattered from ionospheric irregularities (termed\nionospheric backscatter) can be classified in the most simple\nterms as 12 -hop (direct to ionosphere and back again) or 1 12 -\nhop (to the ionosphere, to the ground, and to the ionosphere\nand back again). Longer paths (e.g. 2 12 -hop) are possible but\nmake up a very small percentage of the SuperDARN data set.\nThe exact propagation paths of HF rays depend heavily\non both horizontal and vertical ionospheric electron density\nvariations which can be very complex and variable, espe-\ncially in the high-latitude F-region (e.g. Vickrey et al., 1980).\nAn important technique for understanding radio propagation\nis ray tracing (e.g. Jones and Stephenson, 1975) which in-\nvolves tracing the paths of radio waves through the iono-\nsphere assuming a particular ionospheric electron density\nmodel. This technique has been used extensively but typ-\nically to study the basic features of propagation through a\nsimplified ionosphere. Villain et al. (1984) used ray tracing\nto study HF propagation paths in a more realistic model of\nthe high-latitude ionosphere. They showed that the sensitiv-\nity of propagation to density changes means that accurately\ndetermining propagation paths is difficult, even with more\nsophisticated models. Their results showed significant dif-\nferences in F-region propagation paths between simple and\nmore realistic ionospheric models and are a good illustration\nof the problems of accurately mapping the scattering region.\nHence, a wholly accurate mapping of the location of the\nscattering volume requires detailed spatiotemporal measure-\nments of the ionospheric electron density (which are rare).\nCurrently, in the absence of accurate and reliable measure-\nments or models of ionospheric electron density variations,\na simple algorithm is used to map the scattering locations of\nSuperDARN backscatter.\nThe simplest scenario that can be considered when map-\nping HF propagation paths is that of a flat Earth. Figure 1a\npresents a simplified diagram which shows a 12 -hop backscat-\nter ray path for the assumption of a flat Earth and a planar\nionosphere. The blue square highlights the location of the\nradar and the dashed black arrow represents a line perpen-\ndicular to the Earth\u2019s surface which contains the scattering\nlocation. The ground distance between these two points is\nthe ground range. The black line represents a virtual ray\npath from the radar site to a virtual scattering point (i.e. the\nstraight line propagation path that would result if there was\nno refraction of the ray by the ionosphere). The distance\nalong this path is the range. The angle between the virtual\nAnn. Geophys., 26, 823\u2013841, 2008 www.ann-geophys.net\/26\/823\/2008\/\nG.

Simple schematic diagrams illustrating refracted and virtual HF propagation paths for (a) 12 -hop ionospheric backscatter assuming a\nflat Earth, (b) 12 -hop ionospheric backscatter assuming a spherical Earth, and (c) 1 12 -hop ionospheric backscatter assuming a spherical Earth.\nIn all panels the bold black line represents the surface of the Earth in the plane of the propagation path, the solid black line represents the\nvirtual propagation path, the solid red line represents the refracted propagation path, the dashed black and red lines are perpendicular to the\nEarth\u2019s surface at the virtual and refracted ray scattering points, respectively, and the dotted blue line represents the horizon at the radar site.\nThe elevation angle is the angle between the virtual path and the horizon.\npath and the horizon is the elevation angle. The red line rep-\nresents an estimate of a real ray path which is refracted by\nthe increasing electron density in the ionosphere, resulting\nin a true scattering point, where the ray is orthogonal to the\nlocal magnetic field, which is at a lower altitude than the as-\nsociated virtual scattering point. This representation assumes\nthat the ray travels along the same path both to and from the\nscattering location, which assumes that the ionosphere is in-\nvariant during the travel time. Breit and Tuve (1926) first\nshowed that when a flat Earth and planar ionosphere are as-\nsumed the real and virtual propagation paths have the same\nground range (i.e. the virtual scattering point for any ray is\nlocated directly above its real scattering point).\nThe mapping of scattering locations is trivial for the case\nof a flat Earth and planar ionosphere if both the range and\nelevation angle of the ray are known. All the backscattered\nsignals measured by the SuperDARN radars have an associ-\nated range and many have measurements of the elevation an-\ngle as well. This allows an exact determination of the ground\nrange from the radar to the ground location of the perpendic-\nular which passes through both the virtual and refracted ray\nscattering points. However, in many cases reliable elevation\nangle measurements are not available. In addition, some of\nthe SuperDARN radars do not have the interferometer arrays\nwhich provide the capability to measure the elevation angle.\nEstimating the virtual scattering location in the absence of\nan elevation angle measurement requires the use of a virtual\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/26\/823\/2008\/ Ann.

Hence, the\naccuracy of the ground range determination (and hence the\nmapping) in this case is wholly dependent on the accuracy of\nthe assumed virtual height.\nFor most propagation paths longer than a few hundreds\nof km the flat Earth approximation is poor and a spherical\nEarth must be assumed. Figure 1b shows a simplified di-\nagram explaining the 12 -hop backscatter ray path when as-\nsuming a spherical Earth. For a spherical Earth, differences\nbetween virtual and refracted propagation paths mean that\nthe ground ranges to the virtual and real scattering points are\nslightly different (i.e. the Breit-Tuve theorem for propaga-\ntion above a flat Earth does not hold for a spherical Earth).\nIn Fig. 1b the dashed black arrow shows the perpendicular\npassing through the virtual scattering point and the red ar-\nrow shows the perpendicular passing through the real scat-\ntering point. The dotted blue line represents the horizon at\nthe radar site. The mapping of scattering locations is more\ndifficult for the case of a spherical Earth. Knowledge of both\nthe range and elevation angle allows the calculation of the\nground range to the virtual scattering location. As in the\ncase of a flat Earth a lack of elevation angle measurements\nrequires the use of a virtual height model to estimate this\nground range. However, as shown schematically in Fig. 1,\nfor the case of a spherical Earth a ground range offset exists\nbetween the real and virtual scattering locations. However,\nby making the assumption that the electron density within\nthe ionosphere is spherically uniform and varies only with\naltitude, this difference can be assumed to be small (espe-\ncially at near ranges). Ray-tracing studies suggest that for\ntypical ionospheric conditions the actual ground range to the\nscattering region may be \u223c15\u201360 km different from that pre-\ndicted from using the virtual path (e.g. Baker et al., 1986;\nAndre\u00b4 et al., 1997). This limitation on the accuracy of the\nmeasurement of the ground range of the scattering location\nis presently difficult to overcome.\nFigure 1c shows the scenario for 1 12 -hop backscatter.\nHere, rays are refracted by the ionosphere and travel back to-\nwards the ground (1-hop) from where they are reflected back\nup towards the ionosphere (1 12 -hop). Here, they are scattered\nback along the same path. Assuming a spherically uniform\nionosphere, and that the maximum altitude of the first hop\npath is the same as the altitude of the final scattering point,\nthe virtual path for any refracted ray path can be approxi-\nmated as three connected line segments of the same length\nall having the same elevation angle at the point at which they\nconnect to the ground. Each line segment has a length which\nis a third of the total range. In this case, the locations of both\nthe real and virtual scattering points can be \u201cover the hori-\nzon\u201d. Because of the longer ray paths the difference between\nthe ground range to the virtual and real scattering points is\nlikely to be larger than in the 12 -hop backscatter scenario.\nAt present the standard method for mapping the scattering\nlocations of SuperDARN backscatter makes use of a virtual\nheight model, and elevation angle information is rarely used.\nThe standard method also makes the assumption that the real\nand virtual propagation paths have approximately the same\nground range (i.e. that the perpendicular that passes through\nthe virtual scattering point for any ray is located close to that\nwhich passes through the real scattering point, as is the case\nfor the flat Earth assumption). Hence, the largest errors in\nmapping are thought to result from the inadequacies of the\nstandard virtual height model that is assumed. The following\nvirtual height model is presently the standard model used for\nSuperDARN backscatter:\nhv =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\n115r\n150 for 0 < r < 150 km\n115 for 150 \u2264 r \u2264 600 km\nr\u2212600\n200 (hi \u2212 115)+ 115 for 600 < r < 800 km\nhi for r \u2265 800 km\n(1)\nwhere r is the range (in km), hv is the virtual height (in km),\nand hi is a user-defined maximum virtual height (in km),\nwhich is typically taken as 400 km. A 12 -hop virtual prop-\nagation path is then determined using hv and r and assuming\nstraight line propagation to the virtual scattering point. The\nlatitude and longitude of the scattering location are then de-\ntermined by using the assumption discussed above that the\nvirtual scattering point is vertically above the real scattering\npoint. As a single virtual height value (hi) is assumed for\nmost F-region backscatter, and because a 12 -hop virtual path\nis always assumed, there is often uncertainty in the accuracy\nof the estimated virtual paths and hence in the mapping of\nthe scattering locations, especially at far ranges where 1 12 -\nhop backscatter typically occurs. An additional complica-\ntion is that the virtual height enters into the determination of\nthe beam direction (because of the cone angle effect) (Milan\net al., 1997; Andre\u00b4 et al., 1998), and hence having an accurate\nvirtual height model is of increased importance.\nA number of studies have attempted to assess the accu-\nracy of the SuperDARN algorithm and the associated Su-\nperDARN virtual height model for mapping scattering loca-\ntions. These studies have sometimes used ray-tracing sim-\nulations to investigate possible HF propagation paths (Vil-\nlain et al., 1984; Baker et al., 1986), or have used veloc-\nity cross-correlation between signals from the same radar\nat different frequencies (Andre\u00b4 et al., 1997). Yeoman et al.\n(2001) made use of artificially-induced ionospheric irregu-\nlarities, as well as the ray-tracing technique, to test the Su-\nperDARN algorithm. The irregularities were induced using\nthe EISCAT ionospheric heating facility located at Troms\u00f8\n(Rietveld et al., 1993) and hence provided a definite ground\nrange calibration. The results of Yeoman et al. (2001) sug-\ngested that typical ground range errors were of \u223c16 km for\n1\n2 -hop F-region backscatter and\u223c60 km for 1 12 -hop F-region\nbackscatter.

We use this statistical virtual height dis-\ntribution to determine an empirical virtual height model, the\naccuracy of which can be compared with the standard Super-\nDARN virtual height model. In the companion paper (Yeo-\nman et al., 2008) we compare the accuracy of these different\nvirtual height models using artificially-induced ionospheric\nbackscatter from both the Troms\u00f8 and SPEAR ionospheric\nheating facilities.\n2 Results\nFor this study we have chosen to use elevation angle data\nfrom the Saskatoon SuperDARN radar. A large proportion\nof the backscatter measured by the Saskatoon radar have re-\nliable elevation angle measurements with a good coverage\nin range, frequency, and magnetic local time (MLT), and\nwith only a small percentage of ground (non-ionospheric)\nbackscatter. We initially use data from Saskatoon beam 3\nonly, which is aligned close to the geomagnetic meridional\ndirection, but later we compare these results with data from\nthree other Saskatoon beams. We use only common mode\ndata (characterised by 180 km to the first range gate and a\n45 km range gate separation) in order to simplify the data\nanalysis and the method of presentation of the results. We\nuse 5 years of data (1997\u20132001 inclusive) which are the\nfive years with the largest rates of backscatter (being centred\nclose to solar maximum in the sunspot cycle).\n2.1 Backscatter statistics\nFigure 2 presents statistical histograms of certain variables\nin the Saskatoon beam 3 data set, namely range, eleva-\ntion angle, frequency, and MLT. Here, we separate all the\nbackscatter with a line-of-sight velocity magnitude greater\nthan 100 m\/s (black histograms, which we assume to be ex-\nclusively ionospheric backscatter), from all the backscatter\nwith a line-of-sight velocity magnitude less than 100 m\/s (red\nhistograms, which we assume to be a mixture of ground\nand ionospheric backscatter). The presence of significant\namounts of ground backscatter in the data set would con-\ntaminate our elevation angle analysis. Ground backscatter is\ncharacterised by low Doppler velocity (<\u223c50 m\/s) and low\nDoppler spectral width (<\u223c50 m\/s) but is difficult to iden-\ntify unambiguously. Hence, to ensure a minimal amount\nof ground backscatter in the ensuing analysis we remove all\nbackscatter with a line-of-sight velocity below the (conserva-\ntive) velocity threshold of 100 m\/s (the red histogram). This\nalso removes a large amount of real ionospheric backscat-\nter from the statistical analyses, but it guarantees that the re-\nFig. 2.

The black curves show the his-\ntograms when only backscatter with a line-of-sight velocity mag-\nnitude greater than 100 m\/s are considered. The red curves show\nthe histograms when only backscatter with a line-of-sight velocity\nmagnitude less than 100 m\/s are considered.\nmaining backscatter (the black histograms) is not contami-\nnated with ground backscatter, and is justified as long as the\nnumber of remaining data samples is adequate for the statis-\ntical analysis.\nThe top panel of Fig. 2 presents the histograms of range,\nthe sampling interval being every range gate (45 km range\nsampling). Looking first at the black curve, there are more\nthan 20 000 samples at nearly all ranges with a maximum\nof \u223c120 000 samples at \u223c1300 km range in the 12 -hop F-\nregion backscatter region. This means that there is enough\ndata for a reliable statistical analysis at every range gate\nup to \u223c3200 km range. The red curve has a large peak at\nsmall ranges (\u223c350 km) which corresponds to low veloc-\nity E-region backscatter. This highlights the large amount\nof low-velocity ionospheric backscatter that is also being re-\nmoved along with the contaminating ground backscatter.\nThe second panel of Fig. 2 presents the elevation angle his-\ntograms. The distribution of elevation angles is determined\npartly by the vertical radiation pattern formed by the Super-\nDARN antennae which will peak at a particular elevation\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/26\/823\/2008\/ Ann.

Here, the two histograms (red\nand black) are almost identical, both peaking around 15\u25e6 el-\nevation.\nThe third panel of Fig. 2 presents the operational fre-\nquency histograms. The operational frequencies used by\nthe SuperDARN radars are varied with the time of day, and\nwith the geomagnetic conditions, in order to optimise the HF\npropagation path to give the best opportunity of achieving or-\nthogonality of the HF signal with any existing field-aligned\nirregularities. (However, the frequency bands available for\noperation for each SuperDARN radar are limited and this\nis reflected in the histogram.) Lower frequency signals re-\nfract in lower electron density regions than higher frequency\nsignals and hence refract more at lower ionospheric alti-\ntudes. As higher frequency signals refract less they may not\nrefract enough to achieve orthogonality with the magnetic\nfield at all and hence may continue to penetrate the iono-\nsphere without backscattering. Due to the variable propaga-\ntion paths that exist for different frequency signals, the vir-\ntual height variations with range may vary slightly with oper-\national frequency. This will be considered later in our anal-\nysis by splitting the results into different frequency bands.\nHere, the two histograms (red and black) show very similar\ndistributions with frequency, with significant peaks around\n10.6 MHz, 13.2 MHz, and 14.5 MHz, representing the lim-\nited bands of operation of the Saskatoon radar.\nThe final panel of Fig. 2 presents the MLT histograms (at\n0.25 h resolution). Here, the black histogram is greater than\n25 000 samples at all MLTs illustrating that there is good\nsampling at all MLTs and unlikely to be any significant MLT\nbias in the results (at least when considering all frequencies\ntogether). The differences between the black and the red his-\ntograms are most probably due to the black histogram being\ndominated by F-region backscatter and the red histogram be-\ning dominated by E-region backscatter.\n2.2 Backscatter distribution in range-elevation angle space\nFigure 3 presents the statistical distribution of the Saskatoon\nbeam 3 data set in range-elevation angle space, at a resolu-\ntion of 45 km (1 common mode range gate) in range and 0.5\u25e6\nin elevation angle. The darker (lighter) shaded regions rep-\nresent regions of high (low) probability. The elevation angle\ndistribution in each range gate bin has been normalised in or-\nder to be able to clearly visualise the distribution at ranges\nwhere the backscatter occurrence is low. As shown by the\ncolour scale, the distribution below an occurrence probability\nof 0.014 is not shown (white shaded regions) so as to clearly\nhighlight the major regions of the occurrence distribution.\nThree distinct distributions of backscatter are evident in\nFig. 3. Since ground backscatter has effectively been re-\nmoved from the data set, these three distributions are most\nlikely to represent 12 -hop E-region backscatter (at lowest\nranges), 12 -hop F-region backscatter (at mid ranges), and\n1 12 -hop F-region backscatter (at far ranges). However, the\ntransitions between these different distributions do not occur\ncleanly at specific ranges. In particular, there are a number\nof range gates over which the 12 -hop F-region and 1\n1\n2 -hop\nF-region backscatter distributions both have a significant oc-\ncurrence probability (\u223c1900\u20132400 km range). This figure\nshows that in these regions it is impossible to determine the\npropagation mode to, or virtual height of, any scattering re-\ngion based solely on the range measurement. However, in\npractice it is often possible to accurately determine the prop-\nagation mode based on other information. Firstly, the addi-\ntion of the elevation angle information makes determination\nof the propagation mode possible. Secondly, inspection of\nthe measured backscatter across the complete radar field-of-\nview can allow the categorisation of regions of backscatter\ninto 12 -hop, ground, and 1\n1\n2 -hop.\n2.3 Range-virtual height distribution in real space\nBy making assumptions about the mode of propagation ( 12 -\nhop or 1 12 -hop) it is possible to convert the distribution pre-\nsented in Fig. 3 into a real-space virtual height distribution.\nIf we assume initially that all backscatter results from a 12 -\nhop propagation path (which only applies in reality to the\ntwo lower-range distributions in Fig. 3), and we also assume\na spherical Earth, it is possible to determine the virtual height\nh1 of each pixel in Fig. 3 with elevation angle \u03b1 and range\nAnn.

We assume a triangle with sides RE (distance from the\ncentre of the Earth to the radar site), RE+h1(r, \u03b1) (distance\nfrom the centre of the Earth to the virtual scattering point),\nand r (range of virtual propagation path), and an angle oppo-\nsite side RE+h1(r, \u03b1) of \u03b1+pi\/2. Hence, the virtual height\ncan be expressed as\nh1(r, \u03b1) = (R2E + r2 + 2rRE sin\u03b1)\n1\n2 \u2212 RE (2)\nIn Fig. 4a we present the distribution of virtual height deter-\nmined using Eq. (2). The figure shows the curved surface\nof a spherical Earth with the ground range from the radar\nmarked every 100 km along this surface. The radar site is\nlocated on this surface at 0 km ground range. The curved\nblue dashed lines represent lines of constant altitude above\nthe Earth\u2019s surface, separated every 200 km. The black dot-\nted lines represent radial lines which pass through the centre\nof the Earth and are spaced so that they cross the Earth\u2019s sur-\nface at intervals of 500 km ground range. The colour scale\nfor the distribution contours is the same as in Fig. 3. As in\nFig. 3, the three distinct distributions of backscatter are very\nclear. However, only the two distributions at lower ranges\ncorrespond to 12 -hop backscatter and so we only discuss these\ntwo distributions here. The lowest range distribution, corre-\nsponding to 12 -hop E-region backscatter extends over ground\nranges of \u223c100\u2013800 km with the peak of the distribution oc-\ncurring at virtual heights \u223c120\u2013140 km. The mid-range dis-\ntribution, corresponding to 12 -hop F-region backscatter ex-\ntends over ground ranges of \u223c600\u20132200 km with the peak\nof the distribution occurring at virtual heights of \u223c400 km\nat lower ranges, increasing to virtual heights of \u223c800 km at\nfarther ranges.\nThis large increase in the 12 -hop F-region peak virtual\nheight with range provides important information about the\nreal propagation paths at these ranges. If the real scattering\npoints for our HF signals are near the F-region electron den-\nsity peak at \u223c250\u2013400 km then this suggests that the major\nmode of propagation for those signals with virtual heights\nof \u223c800 km is in the form of the \u201cPedersen ray\u201d. Pedersen\nrays represent rays that are at the limit between reflection\nand penetration. They are HF rays that refract to close to\nthe horizontal in the F-region and are effectively trapped in\nan ionospheric waveguide. They can therefore travel larger\ndistances within the ionosphere, being capable of reaching\nF-region scatterers which are far from the radar. Ray-tracing\nsimulations (Baker et al., 1986; Huang et al., 1998b) have\nshown Pedersen rays that are perpendicular to the magnetic\nfield in the F-region over a large range interval extending\nfrom \u223c900 km to \u223c1800 km. Baker et al. (1986) suggested\nthat these rays existed for elevation angles \u223c12\u201315\u25e6 or less\n(for a signal frequency of 14.5 MHz). Additionally, the ray-\ntracing analysis of Villain et al. (1984) predicted Pedersen-\nray-like signals that achieved orthogonality with the mag-\nnetic field in the F-region over a range of altitudes from\n\u223c300\u2013450 km with 12 -hop propagation paths extending to\nFig. 4. The distribution of Saskatoon beam 3 backscatter from\n1997\u20132001 inclusive transformed from range-elevation angle space\nto virtual height in real space by assuming a straight line virtual\npropagation path. The top panel presents the distribution when\na 12 -hop propagation path is assumed, as in Fig. 1b. The bottom\npanel presents the distribution when a 1 12 -hop propagation path is\nassumed, as in Fig. 1c. Only common mode backscatter with a line-\nof-sight velocity magnitude greater than 100 m\/s are included. The\ndistribution in each range bin (45 km) has been normalised as in\nFig. 3. The colour scale provides a key to the occurrence probabil-\nity in each region; occurrence probabilities of less than 0.014 are\nshown as white space.\n\u223c2000 km ground range (for a 16\u25e6 elevation angle ray path).\nThese results are consistent with the statistics presented in\nFigs. 3 and 4.\nTo study the far range distribution in the same way as the\nother two distributions we now assume that all backscatter\nresults from a 1 12 -hop propagation path (which only applies\nin reality to the far range distribution in Fig. 3).

The ground range loca-\ntions imply that the initial reflection on the virtual propaga-\ntion path occurs at 12 -hop distances of \u223c560\u20131100 km which\ncorresponds to the lower ranges of the 12 -hop F-region distri-\nbution in Fig. 4a where the virtual height distribution peaks\naround \u223c400 km.\n2.4 Uncertainties in mapping when using the standard Su-\nperDARN virtual height model\nWe can use our measured virtual height distribution to in-\nvestigate the uncertainties in the estimation of virtual prop-\nagation paths, and their associated ground ranges, that are\nintroduced by using the standard SuperDARN virtual height\nmodel. For our 12 -hop backscatter distribution we can assume\nthe same triangle as in the previous section and determine the\nangle \u03c61(r, \u03b1) opposite r as\n\u03c61(r, \u03b1) = sin\u22121\n[\nr cos\u03b1\nRE + h1(r, \u03b1)\n]\n(4)\nThe estimated ground range is the arc of the angle \u03c61 on the\nEarth\u2019s surface and hence,\nG1(r, \u03b1) = RE\u03c61(r, \u03b1) = RE sin\u22121\n[\nr cos\u03b1\nRE + h1(r, \u03b1)\n]\n(5)\nMost SuperDARN data analysis uses the standard virtual\nheight model presented in the Introduction when mapping\nthe geographic\/geomagnetic locations of the scattering point,\nand elevation angle data is either not available or not used.\nWhen using such a virtual height model, in which the virtual\nheight h\u2217(r) varies with range r only, Eq. (5) can only be\nused to estimate the ground range by determining an \u201ceffec-\ntive\u201d elevation angle which is consistent with the range and\nvirtual height. Alternatively, we can assume a triangle with\nsides RE , (RE+h\u2217(r)), and r , and an unknown angle \u03c6\u2217(r)\nopposite r to give\n\u03c6\u2217(r) = cos\u22121\n[\nR2E + (RE + h\u2217(r))2 \u2212 r2\n2RE(RE + h\u2217(r))\n]\n(6)\nwhere the model-determined ground range is the arc of the\nangle \u03c6\u2217 on the Earth\u2019s surface and can be written as,\nG\u2217(r) = RE\u03c6\u2217(r)\n= RE cos\u22121\n[\nR2E + (RE + h\u2217(r))2 \u2212 r2\n2RE(RE + h\u2217(r))\n]\n(7)\nAnn.

Chisham et al.: SuperDARN virtual height model 831\nWe can use our statistical database to provide an estimate of\nthe typical uncertainties in the ground range measurement\n(and hence, in the mapping of the scattering region) that\nresult from using the standard SuperDARN virtual height\nmodel. In the top panel of Fig. 5 we present the distribu-\ntion of measured virtual height with range for our Saska-\ntoon beam 3 database as presented already in Fig. 4. In\nthe first instance we will concentrate on 12 -hop E- and F-\nregion backscatter only which we have approximated to be\nextending from the lowest ranges to the dotted vertical line\nat \u223c2150 km range (this is the range at which the peak in\nthe range-elevation angle distribution in Fig. 3 changes from\nthe 12 -hop to the 1\n1\n2 -hop distribution). The solid blue line\nshows the standard SuperDARN virtual height model as out-\nlined in Eq. (1). For much of the E-region distribution and\nfor the lower range F-region distribution the standard model\nmatches quite well to the observed virtual height distribu-\ntion, although the simplified model variation in the E- to\nF-region transition leads to differences. The largest differ-\nences, however, are in the far range 12 -hop F-region distribu-\ntion (\u223c1500\u20132150 km range) where the peak of the observed\nvirtual height distribution increases with range to \u223c800 km,\ntwice the typical standard model value.\nIn the middle panel of Fig. 5 we present the distribution\nof the estimated ground range with range for our database\n(determined using Eq. 5). The solid blue line illustrates the\nestimated ground range when employing the standard Super-\nDARN virtual height model (determined using Eq. 7). At\nlow ranges (<\u223c1200 km range) the overlap between the two\nground range estimations is very good, illustrating that the\nstandard model is generally providing a good estimate of the\nground range, and hence, the location of the scattering re-\ngion. However, for the far range 12 -hop F-region backscatter\nthe ground range determined using the standard virtual height\nmodel moves increasingly further from our measured ground\nrange distribution.\nIn the bottom panel of Fig. 5 we show the difference be-\ntween the standard model ground range and our measured\nground range distribution, as determined from\n\u03b5G\u2217(r, \u03b1) = G\u2217(r)\u2212G1(r, \u03b1) (8)\nThe blue line at zero difference effectively marks our esti-\nmate of the scattering location. A positive difference indi-\ncates that the standard model places our scattering points\nfarther from the radar than this, whereas a negative differ-\nence indicates that the standard model places our scattering\npoints closer to the radar than this. This panel confirms that\nthe main uncertainties in determining the 12 -hop backscatter\nlocation using the standard model occur in the E-region\/F-\nregion overlap region, and at far ranges, as discussed above.\nAt ranges of\u223c2000 km the standard model places the scatter-\ning locations at \u223c100\u2013250 km farther away from the radars\nthan the measured locations. For a meridional SuperDARN\nbeam, this would represent \u223c0.9\u20132.3\u25e6 of latitude.\nDetermining a similar estimation of the ground range dif-\nference for 1 12 -hop backscatter is more complex. The ground\nrange of our measured distribution can be estimated using a\nsimilar method to that shown above, using the same triangle\nused to determine the 1 12 -hop backscatter virtual height dis-\ntribution in the previous section, but in this case determining\nthe angle \u03c62(r, \u03b1)\/3 opposite r\/3, and using this to estimate\nthe ground range as follows,\nG2(r, \u03b1) = RE\u03c62(r, \u03b1) = 3RE sin\u22121\n[\n(r\/3) cos\u03b1\nRE + h2(r, \u03b1)\n]\n(9)\nThis uses the true virtual height h2(r, \u03b1) of this distribution\nas determined in the previous section. This virtual height\ndistribution is shown in the far range section (>\u223c2150 km\nrange) in the top panel of Fig. 5 (marked \u201cTrue\u201d). This dis-\ntribution matches closely to the standard virtual height model\nat these ranges. This is misleading, however, as the ground\nrange estimated from our measured virtual height distribu-\ntion assumes that the backscatter is all 1 12 -hop whereas the\nstandard SuperDARN algorithm assumes that the backscat-\nter is all 12 -hop. Hence, when we estimate the corresponding\nground ranges and the ground range difference, as we did for\nthe 12 -hop backscatter distribution, using in this case\n\u03b5G\u2217(r, \u03b1) = G\u2217(r)\u2212G2(r, \u03b1) (10)\nwe find that the ground range difference in this region is in\nfact quite significant, with the standard model once again\nplacing the scattering regions at \u223c100\u2013300 km farther away\nfrom the radar than the measured locations (bottom panel of\nFig. 5).\nIn order to develop a new SuperDARN virtual height\nmodel in which the virtual height varies solely with range, as\nin the present standard model, we need to retain the assump-\ntion of 12 -hop propagation at all ranges in order to interface\nwith present SuperDARN software. To achieve this when\ndealing with backscatter that is truly 1 12 -hop we introduce\nthe concept of a pseudo virtual height hp. The pseudo virtual\nheight is the virtual height that one needs to assume for 1 12 -\nhop backscatter in order to retain the correct ground range\nwhen using a 12 -hop backscatter assumption when mapping\nthe location of the scattering region. The concept of pseudo\nvirtual height is explained pictorially in Fig. 6. Figure 6\nshows the propagation scenario for 1 12 -hop backscatter as\npresented previously in Fig. 1c. In addition we have added a\n1\n2 -hop pseudo virtual path in blue which has the same range\nas the actual 1 12 -hop virtual path shown in black, and which\nalso has the same ground range. Consequently, the pseudo\nvirtual scattering point is at a much greater altitude than the\nactual virtual scattering point, but gives the correct ground\nrange when 12 -hop propagation is assumed.\nTo determine the pseudo virtual height we assume a tri-\nangle with sides RE , RE+hp(r, \u03b1), and r , where the angle\nopposite r is \u03c62(r, \u03b1). This is consistent with the measured\nground range G2(r, \u03b1). The pseudo virtual height can then\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/26\/823\/2008\/ Ann. Geophys., 26, 823\u2013841, 2008\n832 G.

The distri-\nbution of pseudo virtual heights is at greater altitudes than\nthe true virtual height distribution and stretches from \u223c600\u2013\n1000 km, peaking at \u223c800 km.\n2.5 Uncertainties in mapping when using the peak virtual\nheight variation\nIt is possible to remove much of the systematic uncertainty\nfrom the ground range difference distribution shown in Fig. 5\nby using the peak virtual height of the Saskatoon beam 3\ndatabase as a simple virtual height model. The peak virtual\nheight variation is determined by taking the peak occurrence\nvalue in a smoothed version of the virtual height distribution\nat every range. The top panel in Fig. 7 presents the Saska-\ntoon beam 3 virtual height distribution as presented already\nin the top panel of Fig. 5. However, now the blue line repre-\nsents the variation of the peak occurrence value of the distri-\nbution with range. In the 1 12 -hop propagation region this is\nthe variation of the pseudo virtual height distribution (this al-\nlows us to use the 12 -hop backscatter assumption at all ranges\nwhen estimating the location of the scattering region). Sur-\nprisingly, the transition of this peak value from the 12 -hop to\n1 12 -hop backscatter region is not characterised by a large dis-\ncontinuity and there is only a small transition between the\ntwo regions. However, understanding this overlap region is\ncomplicated as will be discussed in full detail later in the pa-\nper.\nWe can use the peak occurrence value (blue line) as a ba-\nsic empirical virtual height model to see how it improves on\nthe standard SuperDARN virtual height model. As would be\nexpected, given its origin, using the peak virtual height vari-\nation to estimate our ground range and the associated ground\nrange differences (as we did for the standard model in Fig. 5),\nlargely removes the systematic uncertainties that exist when\nusing the standard model. This is shown clearly in the lower\ntwo panels in Fig. 7. In the bottom panel, the blue line at\nzero difference once again represents the measured ground\nrange. A positive difference indicates that using the peak vir-\ntual height variation is placing our scattering points farther\nfrom the radar than this, whereas a negative difference indi-\ncates that it is placing our scattering points closer to the radar\nthan this. This figure clearly shows that the ground range\ndifferences for our distribution are now approximately sym-\nmetric around the measured ground range value, with most\nof the distribution being contained within \u223c100 km of the\nmeasured ground range value. Hence, using this simple em-\npirical virtual height model has removed the major system-\natic uncertainties in the ground range determination that were\nclearly apparent in Fig. 5, leaving predominantly random un-\ncertainties resulting from a combination of diurnal, seasonal\nand solar cycle factors, signal frequency variations, and gen-\neral spatial and temporal ionospheric density variability. This\npeak virtual height variation provides the basis for our deter-\nmination of a new empirical virtual height model.\n2.6 Dependence on signal frequency\nAs discussed above, the propagation paths of HF signals are\nhighly dependent on the frequency of the signal, with higher\nfrequency signals refracting less than lower frequency sig-\nnals. Additionally, the peak elevation angle of the vertical\nradiation pattern will change with frequency. Hence, chang-\ning the signal frequency will change the most likely prop-\nagation paths and hence, change the range-elevation angle\ndistribution shown in Fig. 3.

Typically, the signal\nfrequencies used by a particular radar are varied to provide\nthe best HF propagation paths for achieving orthogonality\nwith the magnetic field over the widest number of ranges at\na particular time. Hence, different frequencies are often used\nfor dayside and nightside ionospheric propagation (when the\nionospheric electron density profiles are very different), and\nfor winter and summer ionospheric propagation (for the same\nreason).\nFig. 8.

In Fig. 9 we present these peak vir-\ntual height variations along with that for all frequencies (red\ncurve), as was presented in Fig. 7. The peak virtual height\nvariations are similar, although poor statistics at far ranges\nfor some frequencies has resulted in larger variations away\nfrom the \u201call frequencies\u201d curve. The transition between the\ndominance of E- and F-region backscatter also occurs at dif-\nferent ranges for the different frequency bands. For most\nranges all the virtual height curves are within \u223c50 km of the\n\u201call frequencies\u201d curve.\nBecause of the complex issue of the combined effects of\nfrequency, MLT and season, we make the decision at this\ntime not to determine separate virtual height models for dif-\nferent frequencies, and will determine a single virtual height\nmodel based on the \u201call frequencies\u201d curve which can be\nused for all frequencies, times, and conditions. In the fu-\nture it may be more practical to determine different virtual\nheight models which are better suited to different frequen-\ncies, MLTs, seasons, etc.\n2.7 Dependence on beam direction\nUntil now, our analysis has involved solely Saskatoon beam 3\ndata.

The black, blue,\ngreen, and yellow curves show the histograms for beams 3, 6, 9, and\n12, respectively.\nDARN radars sample the ionosphere over different latitudi-\nnal ranges they consequently encounter a range of different\nionospheric conditions. The standard 16 beams which cover\nthe field of view of each SuperDARN radar will also en-\ncounter the Earth\u2019s magnetic field at a range of angles and so\ndifferent amounts of refraction will be necessary to achieve\northogonality with the magnetic field. Hence, we need to\ntest if these differences have a major effect on the average\nHF propagation and hence on the virtual height distributions\nwith range.\nIn Fig. 10 we present the statistical histograms of range,\nelevation angle, frequency, and MLT for the data from four\nSaskatoon beams, in the same format as Fig. 2. Here, the\nblack, blue, green, and orange histograms represent data\nfrom beams 3, 6, 9, and 12, respectively, which are directed\napproximately 0\u25e6, 10\u25e6, 20\u25e6, and 30\u25e6 away from the merid-\nional direction, respectively. Figure 10 shows that the sta-\ntistical distributions for these different beams are extremely\nsimilar, the only significant differences being apparent in the\nMLT histograms. Similarly, when we plot the peak virtual\nheight variations for these four beams in Fig. 11 (as we did\nfor the different frequencies in Fig. 9), it is clear that these\nAnn.

Peak virtual height variations determined for four different\nbeams. The black, blue, green, and yellow curves show the varia-\ntions for beams 3, 6, 9, and 12, respectively.\nvirtual height variations are almost identical. Therefore, we\ncan say that the radar beam direction (within the range of\nbeam orientations that we have investigated) has very little\ninfluence on the peak virtual height variation with range. The\nonly difference appears to be the range at which the dom-\ninance of the distribution switches from 12 -hop to 1\n1\n2 -hop\nbackscatter which varies by \u223c200 km.\n3 A new empirical virtual height model\n3.1 Model determination\nWe choose to base our new empirical virtual height model\non the peak virtual height variations presented in Fig. 11.\nIn Fig. 12 we present these virtual height variations again\n(as orange lines). The dashed vertical lines indicate where\nwe have previously delineated between 12 -hop E-region,\n1\n2 -\nhop F-region, and 1 12 -hop F-region backscatter, based on the\nSaskatoon beam 3 database. It is clear from these virtual\nheight variations that there are three distinct regions of the\ncurve which require separate models. In each of the three\nbackscatter regions we have fitted a low-order polynomial\n(quadratic) of the form\nh\u2217(r) = A+ Br + Cr2 (12)\nto the average virtual height curve determined from the peak\nvirtual height variations measured on the four Saskatoon\nbeams.

The black curves show\nthe distributions of ground range difference when using our\nnew empirical virtual height models.\nThe top panel of Fig. 13 presents the ground range dif-\nferences for the two models in the 12 -hop E-region. Here,\nboth models perform extremely well, with most of the ground\nrange difference estimates being less than \u223c25 km. Most\nof the larger differences here arise as a result of the E-\nto F-region transition, i.e. some of the low range F-region\nbackscatter is being treated as E-region backscatter here.\nThe middle panel of Fig. 13 presents the ground range dif-\nferences for the two models in the 12 -hop F-region. One im-\nmediate observation is that the width of the difference distri-\nbutions for this region has greatly increased in comparison to\nthe E-region distributions. This increased spread of the distri-\nbutions is due to a combination of factors, predominantly the\nincrease in the natural variability in the ionospheric electron\ndensity (and hence the HF propagation paths) over a longer\npropagation path. Errors in the determination of the eleva-\ntion angle will also play a role, especially for backscatter at\nfar ranges. Our model, based on the most likely propagation\npaths, will only remove systematic errors from the ground\nrange estimations. A reduction of the random errors which\nlead to the spread in the distribution might be reduced by\nthe use of multiple virtual height models matching all sig-\nnal frequencies, and all MLT and seasonal conditions. Even\nthen, much of the spread of the distributions may remain due\nto the natural ionospheric variability and elevation angle er-\nrors. The distribution of ground range differences from using\nthe standard model (red) is also highly skewed to positive\nground range differences suggesting that it typically places\nthe scattering region farther from the radar than its true lo-\ncation. However, the peak difference value from this model\nis still close to zero showing that in many cases it provides a\nfair approximation of the ground range. Using our new em-\npirical model (black) reduces the skew of the ground range\ndifference distribution and moves the centre of the distribu-\ntion closer to zero ground range difference.\nThe bottom panel of Fig. 13 presents the ground range dif-\nferences for the two models in the 1 12 -hop F-region. Here, the\nwidth of the distributions has increased, further highlighting\nthe increased uncertainty about the longer propagation paths\nassociated with 1 12 -hop backscatter. Here, both the ground\nrange difference distributions are very similar in shape. How-\never, the difference distribution for our new model (black) is\ncentred close to zero ground range difference whereas that\nfor the standard model (red) is centred close to \u223c150 km.\nThis suggests that the standard model is typically placing 1 12 -\nhop F-region backscatter at a distance of \u223c150 km farther\naway from the radar than the true backscattering location.\nThe hump on the left-hand side of both these distributions\nis a result of the overlap region between 12 -hop and 1\n1\n2 -hop\nF-region backscatter and exaggerates the spread of the distri-\nbutions.\nIn Fig. 14 we study the F-region ground range differ-\nence distributions in more detail, concentrating on the dis-\ntributions at single range gates from range gate 20 (1035 km\nrange), every 5 range gates to range gate 65 (3060 km). At\nrange gate 20 (1035 km) the two models have very similar\nvirtual heights giving almost identical ground range differ-\nence distributions which are relatively narrow. As the range\nincreases within the 12 -hop F-region (<\u223c2150 km), the dif-\nference distributions become increasingly wider. Whereas\nthe peak of our new model distribution (black) stays close\nto zero, the peak of the standard model distribution (red)\nmoves increasingly further from zero, being \u223c120 km at\nrange gate 40 (1935 km). At range gate 45 (2160 km) the\ndifference distributions are clearly double peaked. This is\nbecause these distributions contain a mixture of 12 -hop and\n1 12 -hop F-region backscatter. The left hand peak represents\nAnn. Geophys., 26, 823\u2013841, 2008 www.ann-geophys.net\/26\/823\/2008\/\nG. Chisham et al.: SuperDARN virtual height model 837\nthe 12 -hop backscatter peak whereas the right hand peak\nrepresents the 1 12 -hop backscatter peak. Hence, the dif-\nference distributions for range gate 45 are somewhat mis-\nleading. For this range, the measured ground range loca-\ntions have been determined assuming that the backscatter is\nall 1 12 -hop backscatter, and so we should only compare the\nright-hand peaks of the distributions with the zero ground\nrange difference line. Consequently, the right-hand peak of\nour new model distribution is located close to zero ground\nrange difference whereas the right-hand peak of the standard\nmodel distribution is located at \u223c150 km. At range gate 50\n(2385 km) the ground range difference distributions are still\ndouble peaked, but here, the 1 12 -hop F-region backscatter\npeak is becoming more dominant over the 12 -hop backscat-\nter peak. Here again, the right-hand peak of our new model\ndistribution is located close to zero ground range difference\nwhereas the right-hand peak of the standard model distribu-\ntion is located at \u223c150 km. At range gate 55 (2610 km), and\nat farther ranges, the 12 -hop backscatter peak has almost dis-\nappeared and only the 1 12 -hop backscatter peak remains. At\nthese ranges the peak of our new model distribution is still lo-\ncated close to zero ground range difference whereas the peak\nof the standard model distribution is located \u223c150\u2013200 km\nfarther away from the radar.\n3.3 Detailed analysis of the 12 -hop to 1\n1\n2 -hop backscatter\noverlap region\nA number of the figures in this paper have shown that there\nare a selection of range gates for which both 12 -hop and 1\n1\n2 -\nhop F-region backscatter both exist in significant amounts.\nHowever, when mapping the location of our scattering re-\ngion, we can only assume one of the two propagation modes\nin this region. If we are sure that the backscatter is of one\nor other type then there is no problem. However, if we are\nunsure as to whether the backscatter is 12 -hop or 1\n1\n2 -hop then\nwe may be introducing error into our ground range determi-\nnations if we employ the wrong model. In this section we\nlook in detail at the overlap region to investigate the errors\nthat would be introduced by using the wrong virtual height\nmodel to estimate the location of the scattering region.\nIn Fig. 15 we show the ground range difference distribu-\ntions from range gates 41 to 50 (ranges 1980 to 2385 km \u2013\nshown as dashed lines in Fig. 12) which result from using\nboth our 12 -hop F-region virtual height model (blue) and our\n1 12 -hop F-region virtual height model (yellow) assuming the\nbackscatter is truly 12 -hop (hence the estimated ground range\nvalues are calculated assuming 12 -hop propagation). Hence,\nin this case we want the left-hand peak of our double-peaked\ndistribution to be located at zero ground range difference.\nThis left-hand peak is dominant at the lower ranges (which\nimplies that most of the backscatter at these ranges is 12 -\nhop), but the 1 12 -hop backscatter peak becomes larger with\nincreasing range until the two peaks are equal at \u223c2160 km\nFig. 14. Ground range difference distributions comparing the per-\nformance of the new empirical model (black distributions) and the\nstandard SuperDARN model (red distributions) at a sample of sin-\ngle range gates. The distributions are determined by comparing all\nthe ground range values measured at the specific range gate in the\nSaskatoon beam 3 data set with the ground range values predicted\nby the models.

Ground range difference distributions in the 12 -hop and\n1 12 -hop F-region overlap region comparing the performance of the\n1\n2 -hop F-region model (blue distributions) and the 1 12 -hop F-region\nmodel (yellow distributions) when the measured backscatter is as-\nsumed to be truly 12 -hop. The distributions are shown at every range\ngate from range gate 41 (1980 km range; top panel) to range gate 50\n(2385 km range; bottom panel). The vertical dashed yellow lines\nhighlight the 12 -hop backscatter peak of the yellow distributions.\nrange, after which the 12 -hop peak starts to disappear, being\nlargely reduced by \u223c2385 km range. When using our 12 -hop\nF-region model (blue distribution) the left-hand peak of the\ndistribution always occurs within 50 km of zero ground range\ndifference, confirming the accuracy of the model. At the\nlower end of these 10 range gates (\u223c1980\u20132205 km range),\nthe left-hand peak of the difference distribution which re-\nsults from using our 1 12 -hop F-region model (indicated by\nthe dashed vertical yellow line on the yellow distribution) is\nalso within \u223c50 km of zero ground range difference. This\nis because the virtual heights for the two models in this re-\ngion are very similar, as shown in Fig. 12. For greater ranges\n(>2205 km) the ground range difference of this left-hand\npeak increases. However, at the furthest range in Fig. 15\n(2385 km), when the 12 -hop peak has nearly disappeared, the\nground range difference of the left-hand peak is still less than\n100 km.\nIn Fig. 16 we show the ground range difference distribu-\ntions for the same 10 range gates, but which result from us-\ning both our 12 -hop F-region virtual height model (blue) and\nour 1 12 -hop F-region virtual height model (yellow) assuming\nthe backscatter is truly 1 12 -hop (hence the estimated ground\nrange values are calculated assuming 1 12 -hop propagation).\nHence, in this case we want the right-hand peak of our\ndouble-peaked distribution to be located at zero ground range\ndifference. This right-hand peak is very small at lower ranges\n(implying that most of the backscatter at these ranges is 12 -\nhop as discussed above), but becomes larger as the range in-\ncreases, finally dominating the data set at the furthest ranges\nbeing considered. When using our 1 12 -hop F-region model(yellow distribution) the right-hand peak of the distribution\nalways occurs within 50 km of zero ground range difference,\nconfirming the accuracy of the model. As with Fig. 15, be-\ncause of the similarity of the virtual heights for the two mod-\nels at the lower end of these 10 range gates (\u223c1980\u20132160 km\nrange), the right-hand peak of the difference distribution that\nresults from using our 12 -hop F-region model (indicated by\nthe dashed vertical blue line on the blue distribution) is also\nwithin \u223c50 km of zero ground range difference. For greater\nranges (>2160 km) the ground range difference of the right-\nhand peak increases, reaching \u223c120 km at 2385 km range.\nFrom this analysis we can conclude that using the wrong\nvirtual height model in the lower range portion of the over-\nlap region will not lead to a significant increase in the ground\nrange difference. However, for the higher ranges in this\noverlap region the errors become more significant (up to\n\u223c120 km). Our analysis shows that 12 -hop backscatter still\noccurs at these ranges because of propagation on Pedersen\nray paths. Although the amount of 12 -hop backscatter is re-\nduced at these ranges it is still significant enough that we\ncannot simply assume that all backscatter in this region is\n1 12 -hop. Therefore, ground range uncertainties in this region\nare likely to be larger due to the possibility of the misidenti-\nfication of the propagation mode.\nAnn.

Chisham et al.: SuperDARN virtual height model 839\n4 Discussion\nWe have shown in this paper that the development of a new\nvirtual height model for SuperDARN which is based on mea-\nsured elevation angle data significantly improves the accu-\nracy of estimations of virtual ray propagation paths, and ul-\ntimately of the mapping of scattering locations, especially at\nfar ranges. In this paper we have taken a simple approach and\ndeveloped a single virtual height model which produces the\nbest results for average propagation conditions, and hence\nreduces the systematic errors that occur when using the stan-\ndard SuperDARN virtual height model. As is always the case\nwhen developing simple models, and in light of the remain-\ning uncertainties that still exist when mapping scattering lo-\ncations, it is important to consider how this model can be\nimproved in the future. This requires a fuller understanding\nof the factors which are responsible for these uncertainties.\nAs discussed in the Introduction, one of the major uncer-\ntainties regarding the mapping of scattering regions is the off-\nset that exists between the ground range of the virtual and\nrefracted ray scattering points. This is presently a difficult\nproblem to address, although ray-tracing studies using re-\nalistic ionospheric electron density profiles help in improv-\ning understanding of this problem. Other uncertainties in\nthe mapping of the scattering region result from the natural\nvariability of the ionospheric electron density which result\nin random uncertainties in the determination of real and vir-\ntual propagation paths. The minute-to-minute and hour-to-\nhour temporal variability of the electron density, and its small\nand meso-scale spatial variability, which result from spa-\ntiotemporal magnetospheric, ionospheric, and atmospheric\nphenomena are factors that we cannot account for without\nmaking detailed spatiotemporal measurements of the elec-\ntron density (which is not practical over large regions and\nover long timescales). Hence, the only part of the random\nuncertainties we can address is that associated with known\nchanges in the average behaviour of the electron density.\nThese effects are:\n\u2013 Diurnal variations. The peak F-region electron density\nis typically much greater in the daytime ionosphere than\nin the nighttime ionosphere. Grouping elevation an-\ngle distributions according to MLT would allow differ-\nent virtual height models to be determined for different\ntimes of day.\n\u2013 Seasonal variations. The peak F-region electron density\nis typically greater in the winter hemisphere than in the\nsummer hemisphere. Grouping elevation angle distribu-\ntions according to season would allow different virtual\nheight models to be determined for different seasons.\n\u2013 Solar cycle variations. The peak F-region electron den-\nsity is typically greater at times of solar maximum than\nat times of solar minimum. The altitude of the F-\nregion peak is also much higher on average at solar\nFig. 16. Ground range difference distributions in the 12 -hop and\n1 12 -hop F-region overlap region comparing the performance of the\n1\n2 -hop F-region model (blue distributions) and the 1 12 -hop F-region\nmodel (yellow distributions) when the measured backscatter is as-\nsumed to be truly 1 12 -hop. The distributions are shown at every\nrange gate from range gate 41 (1980 km range; top panel) to range\ngate 50 (2385 km range; bottom panel). The vertical dashed blue\nlines highlight the 1 12 -hop backscatter peak of the blue distribu-\ntions.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/26\/823\/2008\/ Ann. Geophys., 26, 823\u2013841, 2008\n840 G. Chisham et al.: SuperDARN virtual height model\nmaximum. Grouping elevation angle distributions ac-\ncording to their position in the solar cycle would allow\ndifferent virtual height models to be determined for all\nparts of the solar cycle.\nIn addition to these three factors regarding the change in elec-\ntron density with time there are two other factors which af-\nfect propagation that could be taken into account in the de-\nvelopment of virtual height models. The first is the signal\nfrequency, as discussed in detail earlier in the paper. To take\nthis factor into account elevation angle distributions should\nalso be grouped according to the operating frequency. The\nsecond factor, also discussed earlier in the paper, is the range\nof different ionospheric density profiles seen on average by\nthe different radar beams. Although for the range of beams\nwe studied in this paper, there was little variation in the peak\nvirtual height between beams. However, it is not clear that\nthis would be the case for all beams on all radars.\nIt is clear from the above discussion that there are a num-\nber of factors that affect propagation that could be taken\ninto account when developing models of virtual height to be\nused with SuperDARN data. All of these factors need to be\nconsidered if our approach is to be taken forward and the\nmodel presented here is to be improved further. However,\ntaking into account all these factors when developing virtual\nheight models would lead to many additional complications.\nFirst, producing a statistically reliable virtual height model\nrequires a large amount of elevation angle data. Depending\non how the data sets were divided it is possible that for many\ncombinations of conditions the statistics would not be suffi-\ncient to produce a reliable model, even if data from all radars\nand beam directions were combined. Hence, if these factors\nwere to be taken into account it would be important not to\noverly categorise the data.\nAn alternative approach to increasing the accuracy of the\nmapping of scattering locations would be to make better use\nof the elevation angle data. As discussed in the Introduc-\ntion the elevation angle allows an accurate determination of\nthe virtual propagation path and allows for the possibility of\ndispensing with a virtual height model altogether. However,\nthe elevation angles measured by a number of SuperDARN\nradars are often unreliable. In addition, it is not always pos-\nsible to make elevation angle estimations for all backscatter\nmeasurements. Hence, for this approach to become a real-\nity the reliability and accuracy of elevation angle measure-\nments at all radars would need to be increased. The com-\npanion paper (Yeoman et al., 2008) discusses how the accu-\nracy of ground range determinations can be further increased\nby studying the elevation angle measurements for specific\npropagation paths to artificially-induced backscatter from the\nEISCAT Troms\u00f8 (Rietveld et al., 1993) and SPEAR (Wright\net al., 2000; Robinson et al., 2006) ionospheric heating facil-\nities.\nThere is an additional complication when mapping scat-\ntering locations that needs to be considered. Due to the cone\nangle effect (e.g. Milan et al., 1997; Andre\u00b4 et al., 1998) the\nazimuth angle that the propagation path of a beam makes\nwith the radar boresite varies with the elevation angle. This\nis dealt with in the present SuperDARN software by deter-\nmining an effective elevation angle for the virtual propaga-\ntion path at each range based on the measured range and the\nmodel virtual height for that range. The direction of the beam\nat each range is then adjusted based on this effective elevation\nangle. For our new empirical virtual height model, where we\nuse the pseudo virtual height in the 1 12 -hop F-region prop-\nagation region, the effective elevation angle of the pesudo\nvirtual path will be different to the effective elevation angle\nof the true 1 12 -hop virtual path. Hence the azimuth angle at\nfar ranges will be in error if this issue is not taken into ac-\ncount. Correcting for this factor will probably require more\nsophisticated changes to the present mapping software.\nFinally, to increase our confidence in the reliability of the\nmodel it is important to test it with an independent data set,\ni.e. using data from another SuperDARN radar not used in\nthe determination of the model. In addition, definite knowl-\nedge of the locations of irregularities on the expected propa-\ngation path will increase the reliability of any such test. The\ncompanion paper (Yeoman et al., 2008) studies data from the\ntwo SuperDARN radars that form the CUTLASS pair, from\ntimes when ionospheric irregularities have been artificially\ninduced by an ionospheric heating facility. Both the EISCAT\nTroms\u00f8 (Rietveld et al., 1993) and SPEAR (Wright et al.,\n2000; Robinson et al., 2006) ionospheric heating facilities are\nlocated within the fields of view of both the CUTLASS Fin-\nland and CUTLASS Iceland East SuperDARN radars, and\nthis study includes data from heating campaigns throughout\nthe lifetime of SuperDARN.\n5 Summary\nWe have developed a new empirical virtual height model\nfor SuperDARN HF radar backscatter by studying elevation\nangle data from 5 years of backscatter from the Saskatoon\nSuperDARN radar. Our new virtual height model reduces\nthe systematic uncertainties in the mapping of the locations\nof scattering regions, especially at far ranges (typically by\n\u223c200 km).\nAcknowledgements.
