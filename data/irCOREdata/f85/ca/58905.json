The area is \na classic magmatic arc terrane, dominated by plutonic, hypabyssal and subaerial volcanic \nrocks with no significant sedimentary formations. It forms part of the aerogeophysically and \ngeologically defined Western Zone of the Central Domain of the Antarctic Peninsula (Fig. 1), \na Mesozoic magmatic arc terrane that formed in response to subduction along the Pacific \nmargin of Gondwana (Vaughan & Storey 2000, Ferraccioli et al. 2006). Most of the area \nshown in Figure 2 is poorly described in the literature. The area dominated by volcanic rocks \nsouthwest of the Fleming Glacier has been described by Davies (1984) and Leat & Scarrow \n(1994), and the volcanic rocks were Rb-Sr dated by Thomson & Pankhurst (1983). Most of \nthe area north of the Fleming Glacier is dominated by plutons and orthogneises, with minor \nvolcanic sequences. Although uncomformable and intrusive relationships have been observed \nlocally, age relationships are inevitably heavily dependant on geochonological data.  \n \nWe report whole rock and zircon U-Pb geochonological data in this paper. Multiple samples \nof plutons or orthogneiss sequences we mapped in the field were chosen for Rb-Sr \ngeochronology. A subset of samples was analysed for Sm-Nd isotopes. One sample of \northogneiss and one volcanic sample were chosen for U-Pb dating of zircon crystals.   \n \nRegional field relationships and Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd results \n \n4 \n \nThe Rb-Sr whole rock geochronology forms a basis for understanding age relationships in the \narea, so is discussed with the field information and Nd isotope data. Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd \nanalytical methods used for data in this paper are those of Royse et al. (1998). Whole-rock \nRb-Sr geochronological data are shown in Figure 2 and Table 1, and Nd isotopic data are \nshown in Table 2. Apart from four Rb-Sr  and three Sm-Nd analyses (including three pairs) \nreported in supplementary data tables by Millar et al. (2001), all the data in Tables 1 & 2 are \npreviously unreported. \n \nBasement rocks (ie. crystalline, metamorphic rocks) in the area of Figure 2 are represented by \nscattered exposures of orthogneisses that outcrop from the Elton Hill area in the north to the \nhead of the Seller Glacier in the south. These orthogneisses are poorly known in the area, but \nare thought to represent deformed and metamorphosed volcanic and plutonic rocks of \ndominantly intermediate to silicic composition (e.g. Davies 1984). Whole rock Rb-Sr dating \nof an outcrop west of Hag Pike indicates a 169\u00b16 Ma, mid-Jurassic protolith age for the \northogneiss (Table 1), and a suite of orthogneisses from around Elton Hill yielded no \nmeaningful isochron. Evolved Nd signatures for silicic gneisses (\u03b5Nd183 = -2.9 and -2.6; Table \n2) shows that an older crustal component was sourced during petrogenesis. A gabbro-\ngranodiorite plutonic suite that intruded the orthogneisses dominates outcrop in the area north \nof the Fleming Glacier (Fig. 2). This suite is apparently undeformed, apart from magmatic \nfoliations clearly associated with intrusive contacts with other plutons or the orthogneisses. \nRb-Sr whole-rock isochrons for two granodiorite plutons of this suite, exposed around Clarke \nGlacier and in a group of unnamed nunataks at the head of the Seller Glacier yield ages of 116 \n\u00b1 2 and 132 \u00b1 9 Ma, although the accuracy of these ages is uncertain, because the long \nmagmatic history of the area suggests the potential for resetting the Rb-Sr system. Nd isotopes \nfor these granodiorites are less negative than the gneisses (\u03b5Ndt = -1.8 to -0.4; Table 2). A \n5 \n \ndistinctive group of later, vuggy, red-weathering high-level granites represents the last \nobserved plutonic episode, outcropping in a zone from Cape Berteaux to the head of Fleming \nGlacier (Fig. 2), and showing clear intrusive relationships with older units. These granites \nrange from subalkaline to peralkaline (comenditic: Davies 1984; authors\u2019 unpublished data), \nhave yielded Rb-Sr isochrons in the range 71 \u00b1 9 to 96 \u00b1 2 Ma (Table 1). They correspond to \nthe alkali microgranites described from Mount Lepus and other parts of northwest Palmer \nLand by Scarrow et al. (1997) and Vaughan et al. (1999). The Nd isotopic signature of the \nlater plutonic rocks (\u03b5Ndt = 0.0 to +0.8; Table 2) is more juvenile than the basement (\u03b5Nd87 = \n-3.6 to -3.0 for silicic orthogneisses and -0.9 to -2.3 for older Cretaceous plutonic suite; Table \n2) , indicating an increased contribution from a mantle-derived component during \npetrogenesis. \n \nThe volcanic rocks that dominate south and west of Fleming Glacier belong to a basalt to \nrhyolitic sequence that is weakly deformed by long-wavelength folding. The sequences are \ninterpreted as eroded remnants of large, central volcanoes, including a caldera structure at \nZonda Towers (Leat & Scarrow 1994). Davies (1984) interpreted the volcanic rocks as Upper \nJurassic in age by comparison to dated volcanic sequences elsewhere in the Antarctic \nPeninsula. A Jurassic age was apparently confirmed by Thomson & Pankhurst (1983), who \nfound that the northern Palmer Land volcanic rocks trended along a Rb-Sr reference line of \napproximately 180 Ma, and R.J. Pankhurst (personal communication, 1993), who suggested a \nRb-Sr age of 153 \u00b1 2 for volcanic rocks from a single location near Mount Edgell. The \ngenerally higher crustal level (mostly volcanic rocks) exposed south of the Fleming Glacier \ncompared to the north (mostly plutonic and metamorphic rocks) suggests that the Fleming \nGlacier may overlie a significant fault that downthrows to the north. This coincides with a \nlineament along which sinistral strike-slip movement is inferred from displacement of \n6 \n \naeromagnetic anomalies associated with the underlying batholith (Garrett 1990, Johnson \n1997). There are large numbers of hypabyssal intrusions, mostly mafic dykes dated by K-Ar \nmethods as Cretaceous to Early Tertiary in the area which intrude all other rock types \n(Scarrow et al. 1998).       \n \n \nZircon U-Pb geochronological results \nWe present new U-Pb geochronological data on zircons from an orthogneiss and a volcano-\nsedimentary sequence that uncomformably overlies a granodiorite. These provide better \nconstraints on volcanic and tectonic events in the arc terrane, and we relate these to regional \nevents.  U-Pb zircon analyses were carried out using a Cameca 1270 ion-microprobe housed \nat the NORDSIM facility, Swedish Museum of Natural History, following the method of \nWhitehouse & Kamber (2005). Results are presented in Table 3.  \n \nOrthogneiss sample R.5414.7 \n \nThe orthogneiss comes from a 2.5 km-long outcrop on a north-south trending ridge which is \nsituated on the south coast of Cape Berteaux, 6 km northwest of Hag Pike, southwest Graham \nLand (Fig. 2). The sample was collected from the west-facing slopes of the ridge, which \nexposes silicic-intermediate medium-grained orthogneiesses which are foliated and highly \nfolded with sparsely developed crenulation cleavage.  The gneisses are cut by folded \namphibolite sheets, and they are interpreted as an igneous succession cut by mafic dykes, the \nwhole sequence having been deformed and metamorphosed at about ambibolite grade. \nSample R.5414.7 is a medium-grained, moderately foliated quartz-feldspar dominated \nmetamorphic rock. The medium grain size and an interpreted relict phenocrystic texture \n7 \n \nindicate volcanic rather than plutonic protoliths. Zircons are prismatic and, although generally \nnon-luminescent under CL, faint growth zoning is evident and no inherited component was \ndetected in the images. Zircons yielded a well-defined U-Pb zircon concordia age of 183 \u00b1 2.1 \nMa. Discordant analyses contain common Pb or are interpreted to have suffered Pb loss \n(Table 3; Fig. 3). This new radiometric age is interpreted to date emplacement of the igneous \nprotolith comprising the local basement and demonstrates that our whole-rock Rb-Sr isochron \nage of 169\u00b16 Ma is erroneous (Fig. 2). The Rb-Sr age probably reflects resetting or original \nemplacement of magmas with variable 87Sr\/86Sr ratios, consistent with multiple crust and \nmantle magma sources in a magmatic arc, or continental margin environment.  \n \nVolcanic sample R.5869.4 \n \nThe volcanic sample R.5869.4 is from a volcanic and sedimentary succession that \nuncomformably overlies a granodiorite at the head of the Fleming Glacier, northern Palmer \nLand (Fig. 1). The location was described by Davies (1984) and re-examined in season \n1992\/93 (Scarrow & Leat 1993). The granodiorite has a weak magmatic foliation, and has \nexperienced alteration of feldspars and epidote veining (Davies 1984). The basal beds \noverlying the uncomformity consist of poorly sorted, graded sandstones and siltstones, that \ndip 28\u00ba to the northwest and contain plutonic clasts up to 1 m across. These are overlain by a \n10 m thick, silicic, massive, lava-like unit, from which sample R.5869.4 was taken. This is in \nturn overlain by a 4 m thick unit of fine-grained, planar bedded, silicic tuffs. The beds are ca. \n1 cm thick, graded or reverse graded and some contain accretionary lapilli. The sequence is \ninterpreted as terrestrial. Sample R.5869.4 is homogeneous, plagioclase-phyric and fine-\ngrained with no obvious pyroclastic features. It contains abundant minor fractures associated \nwith epidote crystallization and has clearly suffered minor deformation. Zircons are prismatic, \n8 \n \nbright, have well-developed crystal facets and are luminescent under CL with growth and \nsector zoning, features typical for volcanic zircon. Under CL, core-rim structures are obvious \nwith rims being more luminescent with internally simple structure compared with less \nluminescent cores and xenocrysts. Volcanic grains without inherited cores have the same CL \ncharacter as the rims. The sample yielded a U-Pb zircon age of 107 \u00b1 1.7 Ma (Table 3; Fig. 3) \nthat is interpreted as the eruption age. Cores and xenocrysts yield older ages of around 130 \nMa confirm the inheritance suggested by the CL images.  \n \nDiscussion \n \nBasement \n \nThe Early Jurassic age of 183 \u00b1 2.1 Ma for orthogneiss sample R.5414.7 is interpreted as the \nage of eruption\/emplacement of its igneous protolith. The Early Jurassic age indicates that \nPalaeozoic to Triassic basement protoliths, that have been identified elsewhere in the \nAntarctic Peninsula by U-Pb zircon geochronology (Millar et al. 2002; Fig. 1), may be absent \nfrom this area. At the very least, such Palaeozoic to Triassic basement is absent from this \nlocality. However, \u03b5Nd at 183 Ma of \u20132.9 (Table 2) indicates that these rocks are not juvenile \ncrustal additions, suggesting that an older crustal basement is unexposed or unsampled in the \narea. This is consistent with the study of Millar et al. (2001), who found a widespread \nProterozoic lower crustal component in granitoids of Palmer Land. It is intriguing that the age \nof 183 Ma corresponds with the first of the three episodes of widespread voluminous Chon \nAike silicic volcanism identified along what is interpreted as the Jurassic margin of \nGondwana, in the Antarctic Peninsula and in Patagonia (Pankhurst et al. 1998, Riley & Leat \n1999). The protoliths of the southwest Graham Land orthogneisses may have been outliers of \n9 \n \nthis episode, or alternatively may have been magmatic arc rocks related directly to subduction \nprocesses occurring at the same time. The first (V1) episode of Chon Aike magmatism (188-\n178 Ma) is interpreted to have been linked to the Karro-Ferrar mantle plume-related \nvolcanism and is represented in Patagonia by the voluminous Marifil Formation, and in the \nsouthern Antarctic Peninsula by the Mount Poster and Brennecke formations (Pankhurst et al. \n2000). Cape Berteaux lies between these occurrences, indicating that V1 may have been \noriginally more continuous, but perhaps obscured by later deformation along the continental \nmargin. Moreover, the \u03b5Ndt of \u20132.9 and the initial 87Sr\/86Sr ratios of 0.7051 to 0.7078 (Tables \n1 & 2) of the Cape Berteaux orthogneiss at 183 Ma is very similar to most Antarctic Peninsula \nand Patagonian Chon Aike representatives (-2 to -3 and 0.706 to 0.707 respectively), \nconsistent with melting of a similar Proterozoic lower crustal source (Riley et al. 2001) for all \nthese Jurassic silicic magmas.    \n \nAge of the volcanic cover \nThe 107 \u00b1 1.7 Ma U-Pb age for silicic lava R.5869.4 clearly demonstrates a mid-Cretaceous \nage for the volcanic and sedimentary sequence overlying the uncomformity. Davis (1984) \nassumed, by analogy with wider stratigraphic relationships in the Antarctic Peninsula, that all \nthe volcanic rocks in the area, including those above the unconformity, were Jurassic, and \nolder than the plutonic rocks of the \u2018Andean Intrusive Suite\u2019. This assumption led to problems \nin stratigraphic correlation, as Davis was forced to invent a separate lithostratigraphic \ncategory \u2018Pre-Volcanic Plutonic Rocks\u2019 in which to place (along with plutonic rocks from \nMount Charity, Palmer Land) the granodiorites that are below the uncomformity. This term is \nnow redundant, as there is no requirement for the granodiorites below the uncomformity to be \nolder than most other (Cretaceous) plutonic rocks in the area,  \n10 \n \nWe interpret the new U-Pb data to further indicate that the large outcrop of volcanic rocks \nbetween Cape Jeremy and Crescent Scarp (Fig. 2) is more likely to be Cretaceous than \nJurassic, as previously supposed (Thomson & Pankhurst 1983, Davies 1984, Leat & Scarrow \n1994). Although the volcanic succession above the uncomformity is not continuous with the \nlarger outcrop, the Cretaceous U-Pb age is the only unequivocal age for volcanic rocks from \nthis area. All these sequences have similar degrees of deformation and metamorphic grade, up \nto prehnite-pumpellyite facies (Davies 1984), quite different from the higher grade \northogneisses for which we have established a Jurassic or older protolith age in southern-most \nGraham Land. A Jurassic age for the volcanic cover of northwest Palmer Land would require \nlarge variations in metamorphic grade of Jurassic volcanic rocks within the same terrane and \nover a geographically restricted area, for which there is no evidence.  \n \nGiven that the dated volcanic rock rests unconformably on granodiorite, it is feasible that the \ngranodiorite or related rocks were the source for the inherited, 124-134 Ma zircons in sample \nR.5869.4, the zircons being scavenged during eruption.  Such an interpretation is consistent \nwith the Rb-Sr whole rock age of 134\u00b19 Ma for the \u2018Nunataks\u2019 granodiorite (Table 1) which \nis exposed in numerous nunataks at the head of the Seller Glacier, and indicates that this \npluton also predates the unconformity (Fig. 2). \n \nRelationship to the Palmer Land event \n \nThe new U-Pb age for the subaerial volcanic rocks demonstrates uplift of the granodiorite to \nabove sea level and exhumation by 107 \u00b1 1.7 Ma. It is a minimum age for the main part of the \nuplift. A degree of caution is necessary when comparing this age to these that directly date \ndeformation events. Nevertheless, the age is remarkably similar to dates obtained from eastern \n11 \n \nPalmer Land for the mid-Cretaceous compressive deformation and associated magmatism of \nthe Palmer Land event: an Ar-Ar biotite cooling age of 102.8 \u00b1 3.3 Ma from a mylonite \n(Vaughan et al. 2002a), and especially a U-Pb zircon age of 106.9 \u00b1 1.1 Ma from a syn-\ndeformational microgranitic dyke (Vaughan et al. 2002b). The same event can be interpreted \nto be present in eastern Ellsworth Land where Flowerdew et al. (2005) provided a U-Pb \nzircon age of 105.2 \u00b1 1.1 Ma for a diorite pluton that intrudes a volcano-sedimentary \nsequence that is interpreted to have been deformed along the Eastern Palmer Land Shear Zone \n(EPLSZ; Fig. 1), likely part of the same Palmer Land event. Although the new U-Pb age is a \nminimum age for a significant uplift and exhumation event rather than compressive \ndeformation, we suggest that the exhumation was related to the Palmer Land compressive \nevent. If this is correct, it is the first date for the event from western Graham Land or \nnorthwestern Palmer Land, consistent with an origin for the event by collision\/accretion of \noutboard terranes of the Antarctic Peninsula (Vaughan et al. 2000, 2002a,b, Ferraccioli et al. \n2006).  \n \n \nSummary of tectonic implications \n \nThe new data help to provide new constraints on the tectonic development of the area. We \nidentify the following main events: \n \nJurrasic magmatism. Eruption\/emplacement of protoliths of the gneisses is dated by the 183 \u00b1 \n2.1 Ma U-Pb age on the Cape Berteaux orthogneiss. This event formed within a Mesozoic \n(?Permian \u2013 Cretaceous) magmatic arc that is now observed aerogeophysically as the \nrelatively mafic magmatic arc terrane known as the Western Zone of the Central Domain \n12 \n \n(Ferraccioli et al. 2006). It is not known where this magmatic arc was situated during Jurassic \ntimes, and it may have been distant from its current position (Vaughan & Storey 2000; \nVaughan et al. 2002a,b). The Early Jurassic eruption\/emplacement age and similar Nd and Sr \nisotope relationships to those of Chon Aike sicicic rocks erupted along the Gondwana margin \nat the same time (Pankhurst et al. 2000) may not be a coincidence. The suspected mantle \nplume associated with contemporaneous Karro-Ferrar magmatism (Storey 1995) may have \ngenerated enhanced convergence and volcanism along the Gondwana active margins.  \n \nCretaceous plutonism. This is the main plutonic episode recognized in the area, forming most \nof the gabbro-diorite-granodiorite suite which was intruded into the Jurassic basement rocks \nwhich was metamorphosed before or during this plutonism. The age of plutonism is not well \ndetermined, as whole rock Rb-Sr systems should be treated with caution. Rb-Sr ages for the \nsuite are around 116 Ma and 132 Ma (Fig. 2). The later age corresponds to inherited zircons in \nsilicic lava R.5869.4 and is a most plausible age for the local peak of plutonism.  It is \nprobably significant that this age is within the age range of the major plutonism further south \nin the same terrane in western Palmer Land dated by Ar-Ar geochronology (Vaughan et al. \n1998). The 132 Ma age is also consistent with peaks of batholithic magmatism in the \nAntarctic Peninsula and elsewhere along the Gondwana margin identified in earlier syntheses \n(Pankhurst 1990, Leat et al. 1995). During this plutonism, the location of the arc is unknown, \nalthough it was probably close to the Antarctic margin. \n \nPalmer Land event. The mid-Cretaceous U-Pb zircon age of 107 \u00b1 1.7 Ma for the lava above \nthe unconformity gives the first interpreted age for the Palmer Land event in western Graham \nLand or Palmer Land. The event is interpreted as collision and compression of the magmatic \narc(s) against the Gondwana margin (Vaughan et al. 2002a,b). Aeogeophysical interpretation \n13 \n \nsuggests that two distinct arcs may have been involved, with an inner arc sandwiched between \nthis one and the Gondwana margin (Ferraccioli et al. 2006). \n  \nEmplacement of high-level granites. These distinctive, vuggy granites were emplaced at a \nrelatively high crustal level and have mid- to Late Cretaceous Rb-Sr whole rock ages between \n71 \u00b1 9 and 96 \u00b1 2 Ma. They appear to be contemporaneous with a distinctive pulse of \ncompositionally diverse mafic dyke intrusions in the area dated (K-Ar) between 95 and 65 Ma \n(Scarrow et al. 1997, 1998). This pulse comprises tholeiitic, shoshonitic and ocean island \nbasalt (OIB)-like basalts, as well as the calc-alkaline subduction-related basalts that \ncharacterize the continuous background of mafic dyke magmatism during Cretaceous to Early \nTertiary times (Scarrow et al. 1997, 1998). The 95-65 Ma dykes are associated with \nextensional and strike-slip faulting of the arc that Scarrow et al. (1997) related to collision of \nan oceanic spreading centre with the trench, for which there is independent evidence from 75 \nMa boninitic high-Mg andesites on Alexander Island (McCarron & Millar 1997). The \nperalkaline chemistry of some of the granites is consistent with emplacement in an extending \narc setting and comparison can be made to peralkaline rhyolites in arc terranes in Papua New \nGuinea bordering the extending Woodlark Basin, and Mayor Island in the extensional Bay of \nPlenty, New Zealand (Smith et al. 1977, Stolz et al. 1993).     \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nWe acknowledge British Antarctic Survey logistic support through Rothera and the Air Unit. \nJHS acknowledges support from Spanish Ministry CICYT grant CLG2005-05863\/BTE and \nthe Andalucian grant RNM1595.
