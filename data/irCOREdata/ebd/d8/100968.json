Seller\nAbstract\u2014Ion Beam Induced Charge (IBIC) and time resolved\ndigital IBIC techniques have been used to map the electronic prop-\nerties of CdZnTe manufactured by Yinnel Tech Inc. The 2 MeV\nproton scanning microbeam at the University of Surrey Ion Beam\nCentre was used to map the charge transport properties of both\nholes and electrons at room temperature. The electron response\nof the detector showed good uniformity whereas the hole response\nshowed significant variations across the bulk.\nIndex Terms\u2014CdZnTe, charge transport properties, digital\npulse processing, IBIC, trapping.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nF OR many years CdZnTe has been a leading candidate foruse as a room temperature semiconductor radiation de-\ntector. Large scale implementation of these detectors has been\nhampered by the difficulties of producing large quantities of ho-\nmogeneous material. Impurities introduced during the growth\nprocess form defects in the material resulting in charge carrier\ntrapping that limits the charge collection efficiency (CCE). In\nthe case of holes this problem is particularly severe.\nIn this paper the variation in the room temperature charge\ntransport properties of a spectroscopic grade CdZnTe detector\nhave been studied on a micrometer scale. The crystals were\ngrown by Yinnel Tech Inc via the Modified Vertical Bridgman\n(MVB) technique [1]. The measurements were made with the\nmicro-focus beam line, housed in the Surrey Ion Beam centre,\nusing 2 MeV protons to excite the detector.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL METHOD\nTest detector structures were fabricated for this study using 6\nmm 6 mm 2 mm pieces of Cd Zn Te with Au contacts\ndeposited on the (111) surfaces. The bulk resistivity of the ma-\nterial was measured from the device I-V characteristics and was\nfound to be cm. An initial characterisation of the\ncharge transport properties of the material was carried out using\nan uncollimated Am alpha particle source with an activity\nof 200 kBq. Alpha pulse height spectra were acquired using\na shaping amplifier connected to a conventional multi-channel\nManuscript received July 17, 2008; revised September 08, 2008.

In addition alpha particle Time of Flight (TOF) measure-\nments were performed using a waveform digitizer to simultane-\nously capture the preamplifier output pulses. By analyzing the\nmeasured pulse rise time as a function of applied voltage the\nelectron and hole drift mobility were derived [2].\nSpatially resolved charge transport data was obtained using\nhigh resolution IBIC mapping. These measurements were car-\nried out at the nuclear microbeam facility at the University of\nSurrey [3]. A 2 MeV proton beam was focused to a diameter of\nless than 5 m and used to scan an area of mm with\na image resolution of 256 256 pixels. The beam current was\nsignificantly reduced so that single event pulses were recorded,\nwith a proton rate incident on the sample of typically 500\u20131500\nHz.\nIn the microbeam system the focused ion beam scans across\nthe top contact of the device and the induced charge pulse for\neach proton interaction is measured using a charge sensitive\npreamplifier. The Surrey IBIC system operates simultaneously\nin both analogue and digital IBIC modalities. For analogue\nIBIC, the preamplifier pulse is passed through a spectroscopy\namplifier which is connected to an MCA. This data produces\nhigh resolution maps of CCE as a function of bias voltage [4],\n[5].\nThe interaction depth of a 2 MeV proton in Cd Zn Te was\ncalculated using SRIM [6], [7] and found to be m. Since\nthis interaction depth is small compared to the sample thickness,\nthe induced charge signal observed from cathode irradiation is\nessentially all due to electron transport, and conversely when the\nirradiated surface is made the anode the induced signal is due to\nhole transport.\nBy acquiring a sequence of CCE maps at different positive\nand negative polarity bias voltages, a pixel-by-pixel Hecht anal-\nysis was performed to produce maps of electron and hole . In\nthis analysis the single charge carrier Hecht equation [8] is used\n(1)\nwhere is the applied voltage, and is the detector thickness.\nIn the digital IBIC technique maps of the electron and hole\ndrift time are constructed from the rise time of the digitized\npreamplifier pulses, analogous to a mapping TOF analysis,\n0018-9499\/$25.00 \u00a9 2008 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

A\nschematic overview of the IBIC system is shown in Fig. 1.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA. Alpha Particle Spectroscopy\nAlpha particle pulse height spectra were acquired in vacuum,\nwith the sample at room temperature, and the peak centroid was\nmeasured as a function of detector voltage. The peaks were cal-\nibrated into CCE using a pulser and a charge injector of known\ncapacitance. Fig. 2 shows the resulting electron and hole CCE\ndata acquired as a function of voltage. In each case the fit to the\nHecht equation (1) is shown, giving values of\ncm V and cm V , errors are calcu-\nlated from the standard error in the regression. The values ob-\ntained are comparable with previously published values on sim-\nilar CdZnTe material and demonstrate the large difference be-\ntween the electron and hole transport [9], [10].\nAlpha particle induced pulse shapes were captured simulta-\nneously with the MCA data as a function of bias voltage. Carrier\ndrift velocities were calculated from a Gaussian fit to histograms\nof pulse rise time. Using (2) the electron and hole drift mobility\nwas measured from the linear regression to the data [2]. Fig. 3\nshows the resulting fits, giving drift mobility values of\nand cm V s , the uncertainty in the values was\ncalculated from the standard error in the linear regression. The\nand drift mobility values both show that the material dis-\nplays good electron transport properties but poor hole transport;\nwhich is similar to previous reported results [9], [10].\nFig. 2. Electron and Hole CCE-voltage data taken with 5.49 MeV \u0000 particles\nfitted with the single charge carrier Hecht Equation. The statistical uncertainty\non each data point is negligible.\nB. IBIC Charge Transport Mapping\n1) Electron Data: IBIC imaging of a CdZnTe device was\ncarried out using a microfocus 2 MeV proton beam. The sample\nwas irradiated with the beam direction orthogonal to the top\ncontact, to which a bias voltage of V was applied. Fig. 4\nshows the resulting electron CCE map from one corner of the\ndevice, covering an area of 2.5 mm 2.5 mm. The edges of\nthe metal electrode on the top surface are clearly visible in the\nimage.\nOverall the sample shows very uniform response, corre-\nsponding to a uniform electron drift length. Fig. 4 also shows\nthe pulse height spectrum extracted from the indicated region\n(i) of the map, which shows a well resolved proton peak with a\nresolution of 20 keV FWHM. Region (ii) at the bottom of the\nmap is an area of no response due to the silver paint connection\nof the bond wire.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Fig. 5 also shows a ver-\ntical cross-section through the map, showing a small variation\nin value which increases slightly from the bottom to the top\nof the image.\nA similar analysis of the digital IBIC data was carried out to\nproduce a map of electron rise time at V. Fig. 6 shows the\nresulting rise time map, which has a very uniform response with\na mean electron pulse rise time of approximately 100 ns. Also\nshown in Fig. 6 is a horizontal cross section through this map,\nindicating a slight reduction in drift time from 120 ns to 95 ns.\nDespite this overall trend, the drift time response is uniform\nwhich confirms the homogeneous distribution of electron drift\nmobility in the sample. This is consistent with the observed uni-\nformity in electron mobility-lifetime product obtained from the\nanalogue IBIC data.\n2) Hole Data: IBIC measurements were made from the same\nsample using an identical experimental setup but with a posi-\ntive voltage applied to the top face of the sample. In this way\nthe induced signals were due to hole drift through the material.\nFig. 7 shows the hole CCE map taken at V, acquired with\nthe sample located in the same position as Fig. 4. In contrast\nto the electron data a large variation in the CCE is seen across\nthe bulk of the detector, with regions of high and low response\nextending across distances of hundreds of micrometers. To il-\nlustrate this phenomena, Fig. 7 also shows pulse height spectra\nextracted from the two regions marked on the map as (1) and (2),\nwhich show mean CCE values of 42% and 65% respectively.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

(upper) Analogue IBIC image of hole CCE at\u0003\u0000\u0002\u0002\u0000 ; (lower) the spec-\ntral response of regions (i) and (ii).\nThe data demonstrates that the hole transport in this material\nshows a highly non-uniform response, with variations of up to\n30% observed in hole drift length across the sample.\nFig. 8. (upper) Hole\u0002\u0003 map compiled from a number of CCE data sets; (lower)\nvertical cross-section along the white bar.\nThis is in contrast to the level of uniformity observed in the\nelectron transport maps, and so cannot be due to lateral varia-\ntions in electric field strength in the sample.\nTo confirm this effect, further hole CCE maps were acquired\nover a range of bias voltages from V to V and\na map was constructed by fitting each pixel value to (1).\nThe resulting map is displayed in Fig. 8; which shows sim-\nilar structural variations to those observed in Fig. 7. The typ-\nical range of values in the sample varies from\ncm V to cm V . The spatial variation is shown\nin the vertical cross section, taken along the indicated line in\nFig. 8. The 2.5 variation between maximum and minimum\nhole mobility-lifetime product occurs over length scales which\nare far greater than that expected from extended defects such as\ninclusions in this material. Consequently these effects must be\nattributed to large scale variations of either drift mobility or car-\nrier lifetime in the bulk material.\nFurther information is provided by studying the carrier drift\ntime, as extracted from a map of hole rise time. Fig. 9 shows the\nrise time map produced for hole transport acquired simultane-\nously from the digital IBIC pulse shape data at V.\nThe data shows a generally uniform response, in contrast to\nthe image, although two distinct region are visible: in re-\ngion (i) the map shows uniform rise time response and this is\nreflected by the flat portion of the cross-section shown in Fig. 9.\nOn the other hand region (ii) shows reduced hole rise times to-\nwards the edge of the sample. This is shown in the sharp fall-off\nin the cross-section at the edge of the sample, with hole drift\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Also, the individual pulse\nshapes from this region are uncharacteristically fast and with a\nlow amplitude consistent with a significantly shorter hole life-\ntime in region (ii) of the device. Since this region of reduced\nhole lifetime follows the physical edge of the sample, it is most\nlikely that this effect is due to saw damage or mechanical stress\nat the edge of the sample. However it is surprising that no sim-\nilar effect is observed for the electron maps in this edge region.\nConsidering region (i) of the rise time map, the observed uni-\nformity in hole drift time suggests that the hole drift mobility is\nuniform in this region. Therefore the observed variation in the\nhole mobility-lifetime product must be due to small fluctuations\nin the hole carrier lifetime [2]; this may indicate a spatial distri-\nbution of acceptor levels in the material.\nVarious candidate acceptor states have been reported which\nhave a suitable capture cross section to influence hole carrier\nlifetimes [11], [12]. Spatial distributions of the transport prop-\nerties of CdZnTe have also been demonstrated using focused\nX-rays [13], [14] and collimated alpha particles [15], [16].\nThese measurements have shown evidence for the localized\neffect of crystal defects, such as Tellurium Inclusions, and their\nassociated trapping levels on the charge transport properties of\nCdZnTe.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nWe have presented charge transport maps using analogue\nand digital IBIC on a planar detector fabricated from vertical\nBridgman CdZnTe. The room temperature electron mo-\nbility-lifetime product observed in this material is\ncm V with a drift mobility of 870 cm V s . This is\nan acceptable range of values for use in a gamma ray spec-\ntrometer with reasonable spectroscopic performance. However\nin contrast the hole transport in this material is poor, with a\nhole mobility-lifetime product of cm V and a\ndrift mobility of 17 cm V s . IBIC imaging has provided\nuseful information about the charge transport uniformity in this\nmaterial, which shows a highly uniform electron response.\nIn contrast the hole transport has significant variations over\nlength scales of hundreds of micrometers, these variations may\nbe due to a spatial distribution of crystal defects and trapping\nlevels.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge supply of the CZT mate-\nrial from Yinnel Tech Inc.
