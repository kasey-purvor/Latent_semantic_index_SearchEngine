Variations in the depth of radar-detectable englacial layers (isochrones) are commonly used\nto assess past variability in accumulation rates, but little is known about the effect of internal and basal\nflow variations on isochrone deflections (e.g. bumps, troughs). In this paper, we show how the\nisochrones are affected by such variation using a three-dimensional flow model to investigate changes in\nthe flow mode and in increased basal melting. We also investigate how transverse flows with lateral\nvelocity gradients affect the development of isochrones. We use the model to visualize how such\nvariations will be seen in radar lines which cross the flow direction. We show that in the presence of\nlateral gradients in the flow field we can produce bumps and troughs when viewed along transects\nperpendicular to the flow. The model results show that the influences of flow convergence, melting and\nchanges in flow mode, when coupled together, affect isochrones over the whole depth of the ice sheet.\nFinally, changes in the near-surface layers cannot be solely attributed to spatial variation in the\naccumulation rate; there can also be a strong signal from changes in the flow mode.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nIce-sheet flow is driven by spatially and temporally varying\naccumulation, temperature and basal melt-rate fields. Un-\nfortunately we usually have little knowledge about the detail\nof accumulation and the basal melt fields, especially over\nsuch vast areas as Antarctica. However, information about\nthe flow field can be extracted from radio-echo sounding\nrecords, which image internal layers that result from vari-\nations in the dielectric properties of ice, due to variations in\ndensity, ionic concentration and crystal fabric (e.g. Hempel\nand others, 2000). An increasing body of evidence suggests\nthat the variations in ice composition andmorphology, which\ngive rise to the reflections from these layers, were locked in at\ndeposition, and that these layers are, in consequence, iso-\nchrones, i.e. deposited at the same time. Internal layers\ntherefore contain significant information about the flow field.\nIn addition, there is some less direct information regarding\nflowlines (e.g. accretion layers over subglacial lakes).\nThe connection between layer geometry and flow fields\nwas originally pointed out by Weertman (1976) and recently\nhas been discussed widely (Raymond, 1983; Nereson and\nothers, 1998, 2000, 2001; Vaughan and others, 1999; Siegert\nand others, 2003; Hindmarsh and others, 2006; Parrenin and\nothers, 2006). These studies show how spatial variations in\nthe accumulation rate, basal melting, topography and basal\nsliding affect the layer geometry. In particular, Weertman\n(1976) showed how layers dip at the no-slip\/slip transition,\nwhich we call the \u2018Weertman effect\u2019. Papers by Fahnestock\nand others (2001) and Siegert and others (2004a, b) deal\nparticularly with the influence of basal melting. As a general\nrule, spatial variation in accumulation rate induces the\nstrongest patterns near the surface, while such variation in\nthe basal conditions (melting rate or flow mode) induces the\nstrongest changes near the bed. Similarly, horizontal vari-\nations in the viscosity of ice induce the strongest changes\nwithin the ice (e.g. the Raymond effect (Raymond, 1983)).\nThe changes propagate downstream and are consequently\nasymmetrical about the source of the disturbance.\nBetter knowledge of the layer architecture of disturbed\nisochrones therefore helps us to identify the source of the\ndisturbance. Moreover, it is clear that there are at least two\nconfounding effects: (1) radar lines are usually collected at\narbitrary angles to the flow direction, and three-dimensional\n(3-D) effects consequently need to be understood; and\n(2) the various influences mentioned above often operate\ntogether, especially changes in basal melting and the flow\nmode (e.g. over subglacial lakes). Modelling and the\nvisualization of results can assist us in this regard.\nThe modelling described in this paper is simple \u2018stream-\ntube\u2019 modelling. Upper and lower surface geometries are\nassumed, as are the accumulation rate and melting rate\ndistributions and the flow mode. Flow is assumed to be\nparallel to the surface slope as in the shallow-ice approx-\nimation. These conditions are sufficient to define the\nbalance fluxes, and the velocity distribution can be deduced\nand used to solve for the age of the ice. Stream-tube\nmodelling allows rapid solutions to be obtained for layer age\nand other tracer fields (e.g. particle trajectories).\nIt can be objected that the distribution of sliding and\nmelting have an effect on the surface geometry; however, at\nshorter wavelengths the transfer function from bed to surface\nis relatively weak (Gudmundsson, 2003; Raymond and\nGudmundsson, 2005). A further, more specific objection is\nthat the relationship between the bed, the accumulation rate\nand the basal properties should be computed ab initio, i.e.\nby prescription of the temperature field and internal\nviscosity and sliding coefficient. However, there is always\na variation in internal viscosity or sliding coefficient which\ncan produce the prescribed flow pattern. Rather than create\nit by the more complicated route of prescribing variations in\nviscosity and solving the Stokes equations (a highly com-\nputer-intensive calculation), we simply prescribe flow\nconvergence using the slope of the ice and the balance flux\nformulation. Indeed, the balance flux formulation yields the\nviscosities as a by-product. Since this modelling is essen-\ntially in an exploratory phase, we ask what kinds of patterns\nare possible in principle, so the major added complication\nAnnals of Glaciology 46 200722\nof prescribing viscosity distributions and solving the Stokes\nequations is not necessary at this point.\nIn this paper, we briefly outline the mathematical theory,\nconsider two-dimensional (2-D) plane flows with changes in\nmelting or basal traction, simulate near-plane flows in three\ndimensions and further simulate the isochrone patterns from\nradar lines that cross the flow direction, and then consider\nthe interaction of surface perturbations.\n2. THEORY\nConsider a coordinate system \u00f0r, z\u00de, where r \u00bc \u00f0x, y\u00de with z\npointing upwards. Extensive use is made of the steady\ncontinuity equation given by\nr \u0002Q \u00bc a\u0003m, \u00f01\u00de\nwhere Q \u00bc \u00f0Qx ,Qy\u00de is the flux, a is the accumulation rate\nand m is the basal melt rate. This equation requires a\nboundary condition for Q where there is no flux out. In this\npaper, all such boundaries have condition Q \u00bc 0. Through-\nout this paper, ice thickness, accumulation and melt rate are\nconstant over time. Equation (1) is used to compute the\nbalance flux. Budd and Warner (1996) and Hindmarsh\n(1997) discuss the solution of this equation under the\nassumption that flow is parallel to the slope of the surface.\nIt is convenient to work in normalized coordinates \u00f0r, \u0002, t\u00de\n(where \u0002 is the \u2018sigma\u2019 coordinate and t is time), i.e.\n\u0002 \u00bc \u0002\u00f0r, z, t\u00de \u00bc z \u0003 b\u00f0r, t\u00de\nH\u00f0r, t\u00de , \u00f02\u00de\nwhere b\u00f0r, t\u00de is the height of the bed and H\u00f0r, t\u00de is the\nthickness of the ice. Following Hindmarsh (1999, 2001) the\nmapped ageing equation is\n@X\n@t\n\u00fe u \u0002 rHX\u00ferH \u0002  \u0003 cH\n@X\n@\u0002\n\u00bc \u0003, \u00f03a\u00de\n \u00bc \u0002Q\u0003 q \u00f03b\u00de\nc \u00bc \u0002a\u00fe \u00f01\u0003 \u0002\u00dem, \u00f03c\u00de\n\u0003 \u00bc 1, Ageing equation\n0, Tracer equation\n\u0002\n\u00f03d\u00de\nwhere X\u00f0r, \u0002, t\u00de is the age of the ice, Q\u00f0r, t\u00de is the flux of ice\nin the region 0 \u0004 \u0002 \u0004 1, and the partial flux q\u00f0r, \u0002, t\u00de is the\nflux of ice in the region 0 \u0004 \u00020 \u0004 \u0002. Note that, by definition,\nQ\u00f0r, t\u00de \u0005 q\u00f0r, 1, t\u00de.

Under the same assumptions, the\npartial flux can be written in terms of the surface flux in the\nseparable form q \u00bc Q!\u00f0\u0002, r\u00de. For uniform plug flow and for\nuniform flow by internal deformation under the shallow-ice\napproximation, the flux shape function can be written as\n!\u00f0\u0002, r\u00de \u00bc \u0002, S \u00f06a\u00de\n!\u00f0\u0002, r\u00de \u00bc\n\u00f01\u0003 \u0002\u00den\u00fe2 \u00fe \u00f0n \u00fe 2\u00de\u0002 \u0003 1\nh i\n\u00f0n \u00fe 1\u00de , ID \u00f06b\u00de\n(Lliboutry, 1979; Raymond, 1983; Hindmarsh, 1999). More\ncomplicated forms arise when the rate factor A is a function\nof the height above the bed. Plug flow (which includes\nsliding) and internal deformation flow with a uniform rate\nfactor are generally regarded as end-members of the range of\npossibilities, at least where the bed is flat. Generally non-\nisothermal flows lie in between these two end-members. To\nsummarize, Equation (1) is used to compute the flux. The\nvelocity distribution, in a form suitable for the age equation,\ncan be deduced from the flux using Equations (4\u20136). These\nsteps have eliminated the need to know the rate factor in\nthe viscous relationship or sliding relationship. Given a\ngeometry, the accumulation rate and a prescription of !, all\nthe information needed to solve the ageing equation (3) is\npresent.\nThe model computations in this paper are as follows:\nmodelling the isochrones over a flat bed with a region of\nbasal melting and a region of sliding; using a slightly inclined\nsurface which is (1) a planar surface and (2) a perturbed\nsurface which consists of a channel in flow direction. In most\ncases in this paper, the velocity shape function prescribed\ndescribes plug flow (Equation (5a)). This corresponds either\nto sliding or to an internal deformation where most of the\nshear occurs in a very thin basal boundary layer owing to\nwarming near the base (Fowler, 1992). This uniform shape\nfunction is used when we examine the effects of spatial\nvariations in basal melting upon isochrone architecture; the\npoint is that while of course one might expect changes in the\nvelocity shape function when a region of high basal melting\nsuch as in a lake is reached, high sliding or highly con-\ncentrated basal shearing have very similar shape functions to\nthat found in the shelf lying above a subglacial lake. The\nexception is a modelling suite where we wish to examine the\neffects of an abrupt change in the shape function on layer\ngeometry. Here we define an internal area where sliding\ndominates, while outside this area we use the isothermal\ninternal deformation shape function (Equation (5b)).\nThroughout this study the accumulation rate is uniformly\n1ma\u20131, and to prevent infinite ages at the base we prescribe\na melt rate of 0.01ma\u20131 throughout the domain (except\nwhere it has been specified to be higher).\nSince we are considering isochrone geometry, we are not\nconcerned with the actual age of the ice. The accumulation\nrate is essentially applied as a scale factor; for example, if\nthe accumulation rate and melting rate were reduced by a\nfactor of ten, the isochrone pattern would be exactly the\nsame, but the age of the ice would be ten times greater\n(Parrenin and others, 2006).\n3. EFFECTS OF MELTING: PLANE AND\nQUASI-PLANE FLOW\nBy prescribing an area with an increased melting rate of\n1ma\u20131 at the bed, we simulate a \u2018hotspot\u2019 and determine its\neffect on isochrones and the flowlines. This is carried out for\nplane flow and for a 3-D but essentially uniaxial flow. In this\ncase, plug flow is prescribed throughout the domain.\nLeysinger Vieli and others: 3-D flow influences on radar layer stratigraphy 23\n3.1. Two-dimensional ice flow\nIn the 2-D case, we use two melting regions each extending\n50 km in the x direction. This configuration is chosen to\nshow the effect of horizontal velocity, as the downstream\nmelt zone experiences a greater flux. Figure 1a shows a\ntransect along a flow plane with the two melting regions of\nidentical melt rates (1ma\u20131). The isochrones are deflected\nover both hotspots and dip towards the bedrock (Fig. 1, solid\nlines). The largest depression is at the downstream margin of\nthe melting spot. Ice is lost along the full area of melt, and\nconsequently the greatest thickness of ice (number of\nisochrones) is lost at the lower end of the area. This is also\nshown in the flowlines in Figure 1 (dotted lines), where at\nthe downstream margin of the melt area a greater amount of\nyounger ice is melted away than at the upstream margin. The\ndepression of the isochrone decreases towards the surface.\nThis description applies to both melting spots, but over the\ndownstream spot the isochrones are less deformed. This is\ndue to the difference in horizontal velocity; the dip in\nflowlines is related to the ratio of downward velocity\n(melting) to horizontal velocity, and this has consequent\neffects on the flowline geometry.\nSome distance downstream of the melt spot, the\nisochrones revert to their initial height within the ice. This\noccurs where ice particles have never been affected by the\nmelting area. Flow over a subglacial bump has a similar\neffect (Parrenin and others, 2006). Siegert and others (2004a)\nalso model plane transects over regions of enhanced melting\nand compute comparable patterns.\n3.2. Three-dimensional ice flow\nWe now consider 3-D quasi-plane flow. Only one area of\nhigh melting is specified. With the 3-D model we can look\nat transects at any angle to the flow direction, giving us the\nopportunity to investigate how isochrone disturbances by\nmelting or sliding are pictured in profiles not parallel to the\nflow. This is useful when interpreting isochrones in radar\nprofiles.\nThe melting area is a 50 km by 50 km square. The\npositions of several transects at different angles in relation to\nthe melting area are shown in Figure 2. The transects deviate\nfrom the flow direction by 908 or 458 from their origin.\nFigure 3a\u2013c show the transect along a profile transverse to\nthe main flow. Here the isochrones show a depression over\nthe melting area, which can be seen to be increasing\ndownstream in successive transects (Fig. 3a\u2013c). Isochrones to\nthe right and the left flanks of the hotspot are undisturbed, as\na consequence of the specification of a planar surface which\ndoes not permit lateral inflow as might happen more\ngenerally. From an observational viewpoint, the isochrones\nalong the transverse transect have more similarities with the\nWeertman effect in Figure 4 than with the sliding effect\nalong the flow in Figure 1a. The transects at 458 to the flow\ndirection (Fig. 3d\u2013f) show a pattern similar to the along-flow\npattern (Fig. 1) for Figure 3d and e, as these intersect the\nflank of the melting zone. Where the line intersects the\ndownstream edge (Fig. 3f), a more complex pattern is seen,\nbecause the isochrones downstream of the melting area\nhave not yet reverted to the previous height. Without\nknowledge of the flow-field and basal conditions, such an\nisochrone pattern could easily be misinterpreted.\n4. EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN THE FLOW MODE:\nPLANE FLOW AND QUASI-PLANE FLOW\nChanges in the sliding mode were first discussed by\nWeertman (1976), and some direct computations of iso-\nchrone geometry near flow-mode transitions using the full\nsystem of stress equations have been presented by Hind-\nmarsh and others (2006; see, e.g., fig. 7 therein). The\ninfluence of horizontal stress gradients is to smooth, but not\neliminate, the features associated with the flow-mode\ntransition, in particular the downward and upward steps.\nThe smoothing occurs over a zone with horizontal extent\ncorresponding to a few ice thicknesses. This distance is small\nFig. 1. Effect of increased basal melting on isochrones (solid lines)\nand on flowlines (dotted lines) in plane flow. The two areas of\nincreased basal melting, each of 50 km length, are indicated by a\nblack bar. Isochrone ages are in kyr and shown in contours filled\nin greyscale.\nFig. 2. Aerial view of a section of the modelling domain showing\nthe absolute flux (m2 s\u20131) in contours (filled in greyscale) and\narrows, visualizing the flow direction, obtained for (a) a planar\nsurface and (b) a surface with a central along-flow depression\n(Equation (8)). Superimposed thick dark grey lines outline the areas\nof melting and sliding, respectively, and the different transects (thick\nblack) shown as: (a, d, g) dashed lines, (b, e, h) dashed-dotted lines\nand (c, f, i) solid lines.\nLeysinger Vieli and others: 3-D flow influences on radar layer stratigraphy24\ncompared with those we are considering here, so it is\nappropriate to model the change in shape function as a jump.\nIn these studies, the bulk of the domain flow is by internal\ndeformation. Smaller regions are prescribed where flow is by\nsliding, and plug flow thereby induced. In this way we\nsimulate the effects of either a small ice stream or a lake with\na small background melting of 0.01ma\u20131. This is carried out\nfor plane flow and for a 3-D but essentially uniaxial flow. In\nfact, in the calculations we have smoothed the transition\nfrom complete internal deformation to complete sliding, as\nthe finite-difference algorithm was unable to represent the\nchanges adequately. The smoothing is carried out using a\nweighting formula\n! \u00bc \u0004\u0005!S \u00fe \u00f01\u0003 \u0004\u00de\u0005!ID, \u0004 \u00bc 1\u0003 2 x \u0003 Cj jL, \u00f07\u00de\nwhere C is the x coordinate of the centre point of the sliding\nregion, L is its extent in the x direction and where !S is given\nby Equation (6a) and !ID by Equation (6b). We set \u0005 \u00bc 20,\nwhich represents a sharp step, while allowing the numerical\nresults to converge to sufficient accuracy as the grid was\nrefined.\n4.1. Two-dimensional ice flow\nFigure 4 shows the isochrones (solid lines) and the flowlines\n(dotted lines) for a plane-flow transect with two sliding\nareas, each of 50 km length. At the upstream and down-\nstream margin we observe the \u2018Weertman effect\u2019 (Weert-\nman, 1976), where the isochrones sink towards the bed\nwhen there is a change from no-slip to slip and vice versa\n(Fig. 4, solid lines). This effect is also manifested in the\nflowlines (Fig. 4, dotted lines).\nIf there is an abrupt jump in the flow mode, there is a\ncorresponding abrupt step in the isochrone elevation.

Hindmarsh (unpublished information) show that the\nstep is proportional to the change in the flux shape function !\n(see Equations (6)) in the transition from internal deformation\nto sliding. The maximum step in isochrone elevation at the\nflow-mode transition, considered as a function of elevation\nabove the bed, occurs where the horizontal velocity shape\nfunctions (5) are equal, because this corresponds to the\nelevation where the maximum jump in partial flux q occurs\n(since v \u00bc !0). Thus, by equating (5a) and (5b) and solving\nfor the elevation of maximum change in isochrone elevation\n\u0002MC, which is found to be \u0002MC \u00bc 1\u0003 \u00bd1=\u00f0n \u00fe 2\u00de\u00061=\u00f0n\u00fe1\u00de. For\nice with n \u00bc 3, this occurs at about \u0002 \u0007 0:331. This formula\nis also derived in F. Parrenin and R. Hindmarsh (unpublished\ninformation), who explicitly consider the evolution of iso-\nchrone slope as a consequence of changes in the flow mode.\nFig. 3. Melting effect with plane flow: isochrones along transects cutting the flowlines at 908 (a\u2013c) and 458 (d\u2013f). The positions of transects\n(a\u2013f) are shown in Figure 2a. The isochrone contours filled in greyscale are in kyr. The area of increased basal melting is indicated by a black\nbar. Note that for transects (d\u2013f) the melting zones are of varying length.\nFig. 4. Effect of areas with basal sliding (Weertman effect) on\nisochrones (solid lines) and on flowlines (dotted lines) in plane flow.\nThe two regions of basal sliding, each of 50 km length, are indicated\nby a black bar (no-slip condition above white regions). Isochrone\nages are in kyr and shown in contours filled in greyscale.\nLeysinger Vieli and others: 3-D flow influences on radar layer stratigraphy 25\nThe near-basal isochrones above the sliding area slope\ntowards the bedrock in the downstream direction. The tilt of\nthe slope is reversed in isochrones further away from the\nbed, and the maximum tilt in slope is found in the middle of\nthe ice mass. This can be explained as follows. Consider a\nparticle whose flow takes it exactly through the elevation of\nmaximum downward step \u0002MC at the ID\u2013sliding transition.\nCall its trajectory the TIEMC (trajectory intersecting eleva-\ntion of maximum change). Trajectories above the TIEMC will\nhave experienced a smaller step downwards. Such particles\nwill consequently descend less in a given time, and iso-\nchrones will therefore tilt upwards in the direction of flow. In\na similar way, trajectories below the TIEMC will cause\nisochrones to tilt downwards in the direction of flow. As one\nmoves downstream, the elevation of the TIEMC decreases (at\nleast until the reverse flow transition is met), so the elevation\nof the transition from tilting up to tilting down decreases.\nAt the downstream margin of the sliding zone, the\nupper, upwards-tilting isochrones rise, overriding the slower-\nmoving ice at the base. They can rise to be higher than their\nelevation upstream of the sliding zone. This is because the\nreverse transition has occurred at a lower elevation which\ncorresponds to a greater step in elevation. Eventually the\nisochrones revert to their initial state as described above in\nsection 3.1 (Parrenin and others, 2006).\nThis description applies to both sliding spots, but, in\ncontrast to the basal melting case, the pattern of isochrones\nis very similar for both.\n4.2. Three-dimensional ice flow\nAgain the 3-D quasi-plane-flow case is quite similar to the\n2-D case. An issue is the transition from sliding to internal\ndeformation only, which is very abrupt. Figure 5 shows\nthe isochrones along those transects. Figure 5a\u2013c show the\ntransect along a transverse profile. On those transects the\nisochrones show a depression over the sliding zone which\nincreases downstream (Fig. 5a and b); however, the transect\nalong the downstream margin also features isochrones\nnearer to the surface with a bump (Fig. 5c). Where transects\nare oriented at 458 to the main flow (Fig. 5d\u2013f) isochrones\nshow a pattern similar to those for the plane-flow case\n(Fig. 4), except in the case where the transect runs through\nice downstream of the sliding area that is still affected by the\ndisturbance, such as shown in Figure 5f. Here the isochrones\nshow a trough followed downstream by a bump. Again,\nwhen viewed on its own, without knowing the flow-field\ncontext, such a pronounced isochrone pattern could lead to\nmisinterpretations of the cause for this pattern.\n5. ADDITIONAL EFFECT OF FLOW DIVERGENCE\nWe now examine the effect of diverting flow into a channel\nby small changes in the surface topography. This creates\nlateral gradients in the downstream velocity. Again we\nconsider isochrones calculated with the 3-D model along\ntransects traversing a region of either melting or sliding. Flow\ndiversion on its own without further perturbation produces\nno effects on the isochrone architecture.\nThe channel is formed by subtracting a cosine function\nfrom the surface s,\ns\u00f0r\u00de \u00bc s\u00f0r\u00de \u0003 B 1\u0003 cos y\n\u00062\u0007\n\u0003 \u0004\n, \u00f08\u00de\nwith an amplitude B \u00bc 1.6m and a wavelength \u0006 \u00bc 200 km\nlocated transverse to the flow (see Fig. 2b). Results are\nshown in Figure 6: the top row (Fig. 6a\u2013c) shows transects\nparallel to the main flow direction for the case of variable\nmelting; the second row (Fig. 6d\u2013f) shows transects\ntransverse to the flow direction for the same case; while\nFig. 5. Sliding effect with plane flow: isochrones along transects cutting the flowlines at 908 (a\u2013c) and 458 (d\u2013f). The positions of transects\n(a\u2013f) are shown in Figure 2a. The isochrone contours filled in greyscale are in kyr. The area of basal sliding is indicated by a black bar. Note\nthat for transects (d\u2013f) the sliding zones are of varying length.\nLeysinger Vieli and others: 3-D flow influences on radar layer stratigraphy26\nthe third row (Fig. 6g\u2013i) shows flow-transverse transects for\nthe case of changes in the flow mode. The changes in the\nbasal forcing are specified similarly to the previous cases.\nThe first thing to notice in the top row of Figure 6 is that\nsmall changes in lateral position, corresponding to rather\nlarger changes in the downstream velocity, have marked\neffects on the isochrone geometry, in particular the length\nscales over which the isochrones change in response to\nchanges in the basal forcing. Along the centre line (Fig. 6a)\nthe flow accelerates downstream, and the slope of the\nisochrone after the zone of melting is particularly low, at\nleast compared with Figure 6b, where velocities are less.\nThese effects result in some surprising features in the\ntransverse sections (Fig. 6d\u2013f). While the overall response is\na dip in the isochrones, as we anticipate from previous\nexamples, the more elongated response in faster-flowing\nregions results in the dip being less marked and a bump in\nthe isochrone when viewed in the transverse section.\nImmediately adjacent to the flanks, we see a relatively\ngentle dip of the isochrones rather than the abrupt step seen\nin the previous examples. This is due to the lateral inflow,\nwhich advects the isochrone pattern in from the side.\nConvergence flow over melting regions could contribute to\nthe radar-detected internal folds in ice streams (e.g. Ng and\nConway, 2004).\nWhen changes in flow mode are considered, an even\nmore complex set of phenomena emerges. Figure 6g\u2013i show\na double bump, or three troughs. The central trough can be\nexplained as above by the increase in velocity. At the change\nin the flowmode, there is a downward step in the isochrones.\nThe upper layers slope upwards, but the slope depends upon\nthe velocity, and is less in magnitude for faster ice (Fig. 4),\nhence the trough. Towards the flanks we again see the lateral\ninward flow producing a downward step in the isochrones.\nSince the slope of the isochrones is reversed near the base,\none might expect to see the patterns of bumps and troughs\nreversed here, but it is perhaps too subtle to discern.\n6. CONCLUSIONS\nModelling reveals that the interpretation of isochrones\nwithout prior knowledge of basal condition is a very difficult\nFig. 6. Basal melting (a\u2013f) and basal sliding (g\u2013i) effect with a channel: isochrones along transects parallel to main flow (a\u2013c) and cutting the\ncentre flowline at 908 (d\u2013i). The amplitude of the surface perturbation cosine is 1.6m. The positions of transects (a\u2013i) are shown in Figure 2b.\nThe isochrone contours filled in greyscale are in kyr. The area of basal melting\/basal sliding is indicated by a black bar.\nLeysinger Vieli and others: 3-D flow influences on radar layer stratigraphy 27\ntask. It is made much harder where data are connected\nobliquely to the ice-flow direction.\n1. When viewed in sections parallel to the flow direction,\n3-D flows incorporating either changes in the flow mode\n(sliding, no-sliding) or increased melting appear similar to\nplane flows. Isochrones are markedly asymmetric in the\nflow direction, and this effect dominates observations.\n2. An increase in melting and the transition from internal\ndeformation to sliding both produce dips in the\nisochrones, but these are of somewhat different char-\nacter. The immediate effect is much more marked for the\nchange in sliding (i.e. the Weertman effect), but the\nsubsequent development of isochrones shows different\npatterns: in the case of melting, they continue to dip,\nwhile with changes in flow mode they slope upwards in\nthe upper part of the ice, downwards in the lower part of\nthe ice immediately after the flow-mode transition and\nthen upwards again further downstream.\n3. Bumps and troughs are found in transects perpendicular\nto the flow in the presence of lateral gradients in the\ndownstream velocity when there are also changes in\nmelting or flow mode, and may be related to folds in ice\nstreams (e.g. Ng and Conway, 2004). The shape of the\nbumps and troughs depends on the lateral gradient of the\nvelocities and can be explained by more elongated\nresponses to changes in flow conditions for faster-moving\nice. In addition, lateral inflow changes the patterns of\nisochrones near the flanks of hotspots or high-sliding\nzones.\n4. Seemingly anomalous flow patterns can be found when a\ntransect runs transversely through ice downstream of a\ndisturbance which is still affected by the disturbance. For\nexample, we have shown cases where isochrones are\nraised downstream of a sliding zone into a considerable\nbump. Without understanding of the flow-field context\nthese patterns could be misinterpreted, which highlights\nthe importance of modelling.\n5. Flow convergence, melting and changes in flow mode,\nwhen coupled together, affect isochrones over the whole\ndepth of the ice sheet. Changes near the top cannot be\nsolely attributed to spatial variation in the accumulation\nrate.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank the referees for detailed reviews and comments\nwhich considerably improved the paper.
