Desai\nand Raymond Kapral, Cambridge University Press, 2009, pp. xi + 328. Scope: mono-\ngraph. Level: professional physicists, researchers, PhD students, advanced undergradu-\nates.\nWe all represent examples of self-organized and self-assembled structures. The natural\nworld is full of them, and they are by no means exclusively biological in character. One can\nthink of e.g. the process of crystallization from a melt or saturated solution, the hexagonal\npatterns that form in Rayleigh-Be\u00b4nard convection when a fluid is heated from below,\nchemical waves, and patterns in Langmuir monolayers at water-air interfaces. Sometimes\nthere is a fairly direct connection between the character and symmetry of the underlying\nintermolecular forces and the resultant macroscopic structure, and this will usually be\ntrue under equilibrium or quasi-equilibrium conditions. Such processes can be analyzed\nand modeled using free energy functionals and relaxational dynamics. Often, however,\nthe structure arises under nonequilibrium conditions, where there is a continuous flow of\nenergy and\/or matter through the system, in which case more sophisticated approaches\nare needed.\nDesai and Kapral point out that, during the second half of the twentieth century,\nthe concept of universality came to the fore to play a major role in our understanding\nof structural correlations and dynamics in condensed matter systems. Although many\nphysicists failed to realize what was happening at the time (and some still do not), it\nwas the beginning of the end for reductionism \u2013 the assumption that all could be under-\nstood by analysis on smaller and smaller scales of length and time. There are, of course,\nmany phenomena that simply cannot be predicted or understood in this way, so that a\nmacroscopic analysis is essential: self-organization and pattern-formation provide good\nexamples. Landau\u2019s unifying concept of an order parameter, coherent throughout the\nwhole system under study, led eventually to the renormalization group theory of criti-\ncal phenomena. Self-organized structures and their dynamics under far-from-equilibrium\nconditions can often be analysed within a similar context, as the authors discuss for many\ndifferent examples.\nThe book grew in part from a 1-semester course on interface dynamics and pattern\nformation in nonequilibrium systems at the University of Toronto. It does not describe\napplications in fluid dynamics but, apart from that, the 31 chapters seem to cover practi-\ncally everything one could imagine in relation to the dynamics of self-organized structures\nin terms of the equations of motion for order parameter fields. After introductory chap-\nters covering self-organization, order parameters, and free energy functionals, the authors\ngo on to discuss e.g. phase separation kinetics, Langevin models with and without con-\nserved order parameters, domain growth, vector order parameters and topological defects,\nliquid crystals, the effect of long-range repulsive interactions, diffusively rough surfaces\n1\nPublished in Contemp. Phys. 51, 551-552 (2010).\nand curved interfaces, propagating chemical fronts, Turing patterns, excitable media, the\ncomplex Ginsburg-Landau equation, spiral waves and resonantly-forced oscillatory media\n\u2013 just to give a few examples of the diversity of phenomena being brought together and\ndescribed analytically under the same conceptual umbrella.\nThe text is very well-written and grips the attention of the reader. It is pitched at a\nlevel that will be understandable to graduate students, and much of it will be accessible\nto final year undergraduates. There are numerous figures and illustrations to illuminate\nthe text, an extensive list of references, and a good index. In my opinion it is an excellent\nbook that can be recommended warmly both to libraries and for personal purchase by\nphysicists and nonlinear dynamicists, especially those working or teaching in the area of\nself-organization.\nPeter V.
