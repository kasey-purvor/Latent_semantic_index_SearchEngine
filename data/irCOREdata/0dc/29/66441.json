A frac-\ntion x of the Ni2+ cations are displaced from tetrahedral to\noctahedral interstices of the oxygen fcc sublattice, a corre-\nsponding proportion 2x of Mn3+ cations on octahedral sites\ndisproportionate to Mn2+ and Mn4+, and the Mn2+ cations\nmove to the tetrahedral sites to compensate Ni2+ vacancies.3\nElectrical conductivity in NiMn2O4+d is sensitive to the con-\ncentration of donor sMn3+d and acceptor sMn4+d electron\nstates and therefore also to the inversion parameter x, which\nin turn is dependent on the sintering history of the sample.\nSintering history also affects the oxygen stoichiometry d,\nwhich again changes the Mn3+\/Mn4+ ratio.2 Such sensitivity\nto sample history has led to a great variety of resistance\nversus temperature sR\u2013Td characteristics and an equally\ndiverse set of models,4,5 including some that are purely\nempirical.\nThe Jahn\u2013Teller distortion of the Mn3+ cations leads to\nthe formation of polarons, whereby electrons are thought to\nbe localized ssmall polaronsd due to the strong ionic charac-\nter of the bonding in spinel crystals. The strong electron-\nphonon coupling results in highly temperature dependent\nphonon assisted Mn3+\/Mn4+ small polaron hopping, which\nalso occurs in CMR manganite perovskites although in that\ncase supported by double exchange interactions mediated by\nthe oxygen anions.1 This does not occur in the spinel man-\nganates and conduction may be understood from a simple\nreal space picture of localized electrons bound to Mn3+\nstates, in contrast to conventional semiconductors where de-\nlocalized electrons are described in momentum space.6 Mac-\nroscopically, Mn3+\/Mn4+ hopping of strongly localized elec-\ntrons is a percolation problem with a percolation threshold\nparameter jC that includes both spatial and energy\ncontributions7\njC \u00f8\n2rij\na\n+\n\u00abij\nkBT\n, s1d\nwhere rij and \u00abij are the separation in real and energy space\nof the i and j electron states respectively, kB is the Boltzmann\nconstant, and a is a localization length that scales the accep-\ntor and donor wave functions. The relative magnitudes of the\ntwo terms on the right-hand side of Eq. s1d determine\nwhether or not hopping is constrained to nearest neighbors,\nand evidently at sufficiently high temperatures it always is. A\ngeneral expression for the resistivity r for all type of hopping\ntransport can be formulated hr=r0 expsjCdj, where r0 and jC\ndepend on particular physical and material properties of the\nsystem. This can be elaborated for polaron nearest neighbor\nhopping sNNHd and variable range hopping sVRHd models,\nwhich leads to the generalized expression for both cases\nrsTd = CTa expST0T D\np\n, s2d\nwhere C is a constant. In the case of NNH, a= p=1 and the\ncharacteristic temperature T0 is proportional to \u00abij only, as rij\nis constant. For VRH a=2p and together with T0 depends\nprincipally on the shape of the density of states sDOSd.8 For\na uniform DOS si.e., Mott hoppingd p= 14 , for a parabolic\ndistribution of the DOS around the Fermi level p= 12 .\nadAuthor to whom correspondence should be addressed; present address:\nUniversity of Cambridge, Department of Materials Science and Metal-\nlurgy, Pembroke Street, Cambridge CB2 3QZ, United Kingdom; electronic\nmail rs441@cam.ac.uk\nFIG. 1.

Data were taken in the range of\n150\u2013500 K using Al contacts, which were evaporated on the\nsamples surface and were covered with a silver layer to pre-\nvent oxidation. The data were analyzed following a proce-\ndure described by Shklovskii and Efros,8 where it is possible\nto determine p from the slope of a plot of lnsWd vs lnsTd:\nW =\n1\nT\ndsln rd\ndsT\u22121d\n< \u2212 pST0T D\np\n. s3d\nThis is a powerful technique to elucidate the character of\nhopping motion, but it is a differentiation method and is\ntherefore sensitive to scatter in the original R\u2013T data.\nSource powder from a conventional precursor oxide\nmethod was pressed into pellets; starting material used for\nscreen printing was prepared by coprecipitation of precursor\nmixed oxalates and their subsequent firing. Thick films\ns25\u201330 mmd were printed onto Al2O3 substrates; one type of\nfilm included an additional glass phase, another set of\nsamples was printed without glass. Sample preparation meth-\nods and structural characterization are described\nelsewhere.9,10 Results from the differential analysis of the\nR\u2013T data are summarized in Fig. 1 and representative lnsWd\nvs lnsTd plots for each type of sample are shown in Fig. 2. In\nthick screen-printed films p values were close to 0.5, imply-\ning that conduction was by VRH with a parabolic DOS.\nSimilar, though slightly higher p values were found for the\npressed pellets. Figure 3 shows representative R\u2013T data of a\npellet sintered at 800 \u00b0C and a screen-printed film including\na glass phase, plotted on two different axes.\ns1d The lnsrd vs 1\/T curves are bended uniformly for\nboth types of sample as confirmed by the good linearity of\nthe differentiated data graphs in Fig. 2. A linear fit was per-\nformed to determine the average characteristic temperature\nT0 as shown in Fig. 3, but these values were corrected by\ntaking into account that the pre-exponential factor is tem-\nperature dependent according to Eq. s2d. Plotting lnsr \/Td vs\n1\/T gave 3233 K for the pellet and 3454 K for the film, the\nactivation energies sEA=kBT0d were 0.28 and 0.30 eV\nrespectively.\ns2d The data were much better described by a plot of\nlnsr \/Td vs 1\/T0.5 appropriate for VRH with a parabolic\nshape of the DOS. By assuming a DOS of the form gs\u00abd\n=g0 \u00b7\u00ab2, and using the Mn3+\/Mn4+ cation radii from a hard\nsphere model as an upper limit for a,11 a lower limit for g0\ncan be obtained from T0 according to Mansfield.7 But evi-\ndence from impedance spectroscopy12 suggested that a\n<0.3 \u00c5 and an estimated value for g0 was obtained. The\nvalues of g0, the resistivity rRT at 20 \u00b0C and T0 for pellets\nand films are summarized in Table I.\nP values below 1 indicate a change of activation energy\nwith temperature, but only if the hopping distance r changes\nas well the situation can be described as VRH. In conven-\ntional semiconductors p values ,1 can be associated with a\nFIG. 2. Representative lnsWd vs lnsTd plots for a pressed pellet and a screen-\nprinted film.

This is not a valid approach in NiMn2O4+d, where\nelectrons are always strongly localized due to the ionic type\nof crystal bonding, and the variations in activation energy\nlead to a change in the maximum hopping distance as well,\nand to VRH. The parabolic shape of the DOS in NiMnO4+d\nmay arise from electron\u2013electron interactions, but nonuni-\nform crystal strain due to inhomogeneous electron-phonon\ninteractions or grain boundary effects may lead to deviations\nfrom a strict parabolic relationship and explain the deviations\nof p in the pellets.\nIn order to investigate the energy distribution of the DOS\nin NiMnO4+d, STS measurements were carried out on thin\ns,200 nmd films, sputter deposited on k100l oriented Si sub-\nstrates. Sample preparation methods and the STS apparatus\nsetup are described in detail elsewhere.13,14 It had been\nshown there that the shape of the DOS is parabolic with a\nbroad gap, but here more detailed low energy STS results are\nshown in Fig. 4 as a plot of the DOS versus electron energy.\nIt is suggested that the shape of the DOS may be consistent\nwith Hubbard type bands below and above the Fermi level at\n,0.1 eV within the broad gap, corresponding to Mn3+ and\nMn4+ cations, respectively. The gs\u00abd values determined from\ng0 sTable Id at 0.1 eV are in the order of ,4\n31021 eV\u22121\/cm\u22123, which is two orders of magnitude lower\nthan for crystalline Ge at the conduction band edge. The\nHubbard bands evolve more clearly at higher temperatures,\nwhich it is believed to be an artifact of the measurement. The\nMn3+\/Mn4+ charge transfer rate rather than the gap between\nsample and tip may be limiting the tunneling current at lower\ntemperatures as the films exhibited a high dc resistance of\n,108 V at room temperature.\nIn conclusion, VRH associated with a parabolic DOS\nappears to be the dominant electron transport process. STS\nsuggested that the parabolic shape may arise from Hubbard\ntype bands.\nA.B. acknowledges financial support from the Overseas\nResearch Scholarship sORSd scheme and the University of\nDurham.\n1N.
