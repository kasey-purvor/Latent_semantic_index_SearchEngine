Woodland types range \nfrom large areas, generally called forests, to smaller areas known by terms such as \nwoods, copses and shelterbelts.  Since 1988 the government in the UK, as in other \ncountries in the European Union, has provided grant schemes to support landowners who \nplant new woodlands.  The aims of such schemes have included reducing agricultural \nsurpluses, enhancing the landscape, creating new wildlife habitats, encouraging \nrecreational use, supporting farm income and rural employment, and supplying timber \n(Rollinson, 1999).  Between 1996 and 1998, one particular grant was the \u201cCommunity \nWoodland Supplement\u201d which supported the planting of new community woodlands \nwithin 8 km of a village, town, or city, where there are few other types of woodland \navailable for recreation (Forestry Commission, 1998).  The typical additional grant \navailable for such woodlands was \u00a3950 per hectare (1996-1998 prices).  Hence in the \ncontext of this paper, community woodlands are defined as areas of trees with free \npublic access close to a significant population centre.   \n \nThis paper has three main objectives: (i) to determine the applicability of an ecosystem \nfunctions approach to classifying the diverse array of functions and services generated \nby semi-natural ecosystems such as community woodlands, (ii) to link these multiple \nfunctions and services with particular stakeholder interests and preferences, and (iii) to \nexplore potential synergies and tensions.   Following a brief review of the principles of \necosystem and stakeholder analyses, the paper explains the methods used to meet the \nresearch objectives, and presents the results of a pilot and main stakeholder survey.  The \nresults are discussed in terms of the applicability of the framework, the responses of \nindividual stakeholders, and a consideration of how the framework can be used to \nidentify and address potential areas of synergy and tension.    \n \nEcosystems framework \n \nThe ecosystems framework adopts an anthropogenic viewpoint in that it links the stock \nof natural assets found in land, water, air and living systems, with an associated flow of \nservices that provide benefits to people and communities.  The assets are often termed \n\u201cnatural capital\u201d, which are associated with a range of processes or \u201cfunctions\u201d, which \ncan provide goods and services (items that confer benefit and advantage) to meet human \nneeds, directly or indirectly (Turner et al., 2000; de Groot et al., 2002, Farber et al., 2002; \nHein et al., 2006; de Groot, 2006; Zhang et al., 2007).  Such an approach reinforces \nDaily\u2019s (1997) description of the public benefits of ecosystem uses, goods and services \nthat sustain and fulfil human life. These concepts have been used by the Millennium \nEcosystem Assessment (2005) to represent the flow of benefits to society generated by \nstocks of renewable natural resources and related ecosystems, and the consequences for \nhuman well-being. \n \nDe Groot et al. (2002) use the term \u201cecosystem function\u201d to describe \u201cthe capacity of \nnatural processes and components to provide goods and services that satisfy human \nneeds\u201d.  They then list four categories of functions in the order of \u2018regulation\u2019, \u2018habitat\u2019, \n  \n3\n\u2018production\u2019, and \u2018information\u2019, with the functioning of the last two categories being \ndependent on the first two. \n\u2022 Regulation functions \u2013 the capacity to regulate essential ecological processes and \nlife support systems i.e. regulating climatic, water, soil, nutrients, ecological and \ngenetic conditions. \n\u2022 Habitat functions \u2013 provision of a place for plants and animals, helping with the \nconservation of genetic, species and ecosystem diversity (the habitat function is \nsometimes referred to as a carrier function). \n\u2022 Production functions \u2013 the capacity to create biomass and thereby the production \nof goods such as food, raw materials, and energy resources. \n\u2022 Information functions \u2013 the capacity to contribute to human well-being through \nknowledge and experience and sense of relationship with context e.g. spiritual \nexperiences, aesthetic pleasure, cognition and recreation.  \nWithin each of these functions it is also possible to identify specific \u201cuses\u201d which are the \ngoods and services obtained from a particular function category (de Groot et al., 2002). \n \nStakeholder interests and preferences \n \nThe anthropocentric focus of the ecosystem function approach requires an appreciation \nof the distribution of the flows of actual or potential goods and services amongst \ndifferent stakeholder groups (Turner et al., 2000).  Stakeholders are individuals, groups \nor organisations with an interest in a particular phenomenon, further distinguished \naccording to the degree to which they can influence the phenomenon of concern \n(Friedman and Miles, 2006).   In this context, it can be useful to understand the \nimportance of entitlement and property rights in terms of the claims placed on the \nservices described by the ecosystem approach (Bromley, 1991; Baltzer, 1998).   Selman \n(1996) argues that in the UK the location and design of new woodlands and the \nmanagement of existing woodlands has largely been determined by woodland owners, \nwho often have an interest in a particular service, e.g. timber production or conservation, \nwith a high degree of influence through their ownership of the land.  However as \ndiscussed earlier, the UK government and the European Union have invested public \nmoney in the form of grants in the establishment of new woodlands.  Hence it is \narguable that the public good aspects of community woodlands need to become better \ndefined so that stakeholder interests, preferences and values are adequately accounted for \nin future management decisions.  This balancing of the requirements of key stakeholders \nwhilst, where possible, maintaining the integrity of the ecosystem is a difficult task that \nrequires a sound understanding of existing social, economic and environmental \ninteractions (Ravnborg & Westermann 2002; O\u2019Brien, 2004).    In some cases this may \nrequire a wider knowledge by key stakeholders of the importance of ecosystem functions \n(Lewan & S\u00f6derqvist, 2002), and in turn greater information and stakeholder \nengagement may also increase the demand for the ecosystem services of community \nwoodlands.   \n  \n4\nMaterials and methods \n \nThe method was based on a case study strategy involving three community woodlands.  \nThe sites, all in Bedfordshire in Eastern England, were selected because they had \ncontrasting forms of woodland ownership, each was open to the public, and each had \nreceived governmental support to encourage public access.  The woodlands comprised \none of mainly poplar (Populus spp.) species (Pegnut Wood, 52\u00b07\u00b4 N; 0\u00b013\u00b4 W; 35 m \nabove sea level); and two of mixed-broadleaf species (Clapham Park Wood, 52\u00b010\u00b4 N; \n0\u00b028\u00b4 W; 60 m and Reynolds Wood, 52\u00b02\u00b4N; 0\u00b036\u00b4 W; 75 m).  Pegnut Wood, at the \nedge of the town of Potton, comprises 36.5 ha of poplar planted between 1994 and 1996 \non land owned by an agri-business co-operative.   Clapham Park Wood comprises 21 ha \nof mixed broadleaf woodland and silvopastoral agroforestry mainly oak (Quercus robur) \nand ash (Fraxinus excelsior) situated in the parish of Brickhill, north-west of the county \ntown of Bedford.  This woodland belongs to a local government authority.  It was \nestablished as a demonstration wood in 1998 (Burgess et al., 2000).  Reynolds Wood, \nnear Brogborough is a 100 ha mixed broadleaf woodland, planted in 1993 belonging to a \ncharitable trust and managed with support from the local government authority.   \n \nThe next step in the method had two objectives: i) the compilation of a list of ecosystem \nservices provided by community woodlands, and ii) the assessment of the suitability of a \nquestionnaire to determine the importance that local residents placed on those services.  \nAn initial literature review provided an initial list of a range of regulating, habitat, \nproduction and information services (Costanza et al. 1997; de Groot et al. 2002; Turner \net al. 2003).  The appropriateness of the list and the suitability of a questionnaire were \nthen evaluated in pilot interviews with 20 respondents living close to Pegnut Wood in \nJanuary and February 2005.  The questionnaire was constructed so that it contained four \ninitial sections, matching the four categories of ecosystem function.  In each section, the \nrespondents were asked to allocate 100 points indicating the relative importance to them \nof the services derived from each category of function, thereby creating an ordinal \nnumerical measure of the importance that individuals indicated for each service \n(Neuman, 2003) (Table 1).  In addition to the identified services, \u201cother services\u201d was \nalso always included as an option.  Once this was completed, the respondents were asked \nto allocate a further 100 points to indicate the relative importance of the four categories: \nregulation, habitat, production and information.  In the pilot survey, a number of \nrespondents raised issues including the presence of fly-tipping, litter, and dog excrement.  \nWhilst early use of the ecosystem approach has tended to concentrate on the positive \nservices of ecosystems, Zhang et al. (2007) have highlighted the role of dis-services in \nagricultural ecosystems.  Such dis-services are environmental \u2018bads\u2019 borne by one party \nwithout compensation as result of actions (or inaction) by another party.   To respond to \nthis, after the pilot survey a fifth category of \u201cnegative\u201d or dis-services was included \n(Table 1).  Although in the survey dis-services were included as a separate group, it is \nalso possible to consider them as \u201cnegative\u201d aspects of regulating, habitat, production, or \ninformation services.   In fact, the perception of whether the service is positive or \nnegative will depend on the user, e.g. the tendency of woodland to attract fly-tipping \nwaste may be seen as negative by a walker, but a benefit by the person disposing of the \nwaste.  \n \n  \n5\nTable 1: Ecosystem functions and related services and dis-services of community woodlands as used in the \nmain survey.  The list of services was based on Costanza et al. (1997), de Groot et al. (2002), Turner et al. \n(2003) and feedback from the pilot survey. \n \nEcosystem \nfunctions \nServices Dis-services \nRegulation Carbon storage \nFavourable microclimate \nSoil protection \nWind protection \nDust removal \nNoise reduction \nFlood prevention \nDerelict site restoration \n \nHabitat Habitat for wild plant\/animal species \nPlant conservation \nDeer and game bird conservation \nOther animal conservation \n \nProduction Timber production \nFuelwood\/charcoal production \nNut and fruit production \nEmployment \n \nInformation Walking1 \nDog walking \nGame shooting \nLandscape appreciation \nEducation and research \nUrban growth control \nLandscape screening \nFly tipping \nDog excrement and litter disposal \nDrug use \nOther criminal activity \n \nNote: 1. Walking was not included in the survey of residents.  \n \n \nAfter the pilot survey, a full survey of local residents took place between February and \nSeptember 2005.  Data were collected via semi-structured interviews and structured self-\nadministered questionnaires with 200 individuals living in residential areas adjacent to \nthe selected woodlands namely Potton (80), Brickhill (80) and Brogborough (40).  The \nindividuals were selected randomly from the sampling frame of local electoral registers \nand each respondent was given the questionnaire in person.   Between February and \nApril 2006, a similar questionnaire was posted to the three woodland owners, three \nrepresentatives of governmental institutions, and six representatives from conservation \ngroups, following initial discussions in person or by electronic mail and telephone.  \nUnfortunately although \u201cwalking\u201d and \u201cdog-walking\u201d were included separately in the \nsecond set of questionnaires, \u201cwalking\u201d was omitted in the questionnaires given to \nresidents.  The governmental institutions were forestry and woodland related.  The \nrepresentatives of the conservation groups were locally-based and associated with the \nBritish Trust for Conservation Volunteers. \n \nCompleted survey forms were received from 39 residents of Potton (49% response rate), \n38 people at Brickhill (47% response rate) and 7 residents of Brogborough (18% \nresponse rate).  The results from the survey were checked, entered onto a computer and \nstatistically analysed using a non-parametric Friedman analysis of variance within the \nStatistica Software package.  The results were then analysed for similarities and \n  \n6\ndifferences to identify potential synergies and tensions between stakeholders relating to \nthe ecosystem function, use and value of community woods.   \n \nResults \nThe results are described in terms of the relative weighting of importance given to the \nfive categories of ecosystem services, and then in terms of the specific services within \neach category. \n \nStakeholder perceptions of ecosystem functions  \nLocal residents placed different (p < 0.001) levels of importance on the five categories of \necosystem services (Figure 1a).  A greater importance was placed on the positive \nservices associated with the information (37% of the total importance) and habitat (33%) \nfunctions, than the regulation (17%) and production (7%) functions.  Local residents also \nascribed a substantial level of importance (6%) to negative services   \n \nEach woodland owner also ascribed a greater importance to the positive services \nprovided by the information (30-40%) and habitat functions (20-40%) than the \nproduction and regulation functions (10-20%) (Figure 1b).  However two of the three \nowners also placed a high level of importance (10-20%) on negative services.  Overall, \nthe three representatives of the government institutions ascribed a higher level of relative \nimportance (50%) to positive information services, and a lower level of relative \nimportance to positive habitat services than other stakeholders.  As may be expected, the \nwoodland conservation groups placed the greatest relative importance on the positive \nhabitat services (39%) of the woodland.  \n \nRegulation services \nThe four groups of stakeholders allocated between 10 and 18% of the overall importance \nof community woodlands to regulation services (Figure 1).  When local residents were \nasked to identify the relative importance of individual regulating services, the greatest \nweighting (p < 0.001), out of a total of about 16%, was allocated to regulating a \nfavourable microclimate (3%), followed by soil protection, site restoration, carbon \nstorage, noise reduction, and wind protection (all 2%) (Table 2).  When the woodland \nowners were asked to indicate the importance of regulation services, carbon storage (2-\n3%); flood prevention (1-3%) and creation of a favourable climate (1-2%) were ranked \nmost highly (Table 2).  The representatives of the government institutions also allocated \nthe greatest (p = 0.06) relative importance, out of a total of 13%, to carbon storage, flood \nprevention, and links to other schemes (3% each).  There was no significant (p = 0.33) \ndifferences in the weighting given by the conservation groups to different regulation \nservices.  \n \nHabitat services \nLocal residents, who ascribed 33% of the total importance of the woodlands to habitat \nservices (Figure 1), ascribed a greater value (p < 0.001) to the provision of wild animal \nand wild plant habitats (14%), than for plant conservation, deer and game bird \nconservation, and other animal conservation (all 6-7%) (Table 2).  The conservation \ngroups, who ascribed 39% of the total importance to habitat services (Figure 1a), also \nplaced greater (p < 0.001) importance on the provision wild plants and animal habitats \n(25%) than deer and game bird conservation (1%) (Table 2).  By contrast the \ngovernment representatives and two of the three owners placed a similar importance on \n  \n7\nthe conservation of plants and animals as the provision of a habitat for wild plants and \nanimals (Table 2).   \n \n \na) Local residents, government institutions, and conservation groups \n0\n20\n40\n60\nRegulation Habitat Production Information Dis-service\nCategory of use\nPr\nop\nor\ntio\nn \nof\n o\nve\nra\nll \nim\npo\nrt\nan\nce\n (%\n)\nResidents Government Conservation group\n \nb) Owners \n0\n20\n40\n60\nRegulation Habitat Production Information Dis-service\nCategory of use\nPr\nop\nor\ntio\nn \nof\n o\nve\nra\nl \nim\npo\nrt\nan\nce\n (%\n)\nAgribusiness co-operative Local authority Charitable trust\n \n \nFigure 1.

The dis-service category primarily relates to information dis-services.  Error bars show \nstandard errors. \n \nProduction services \nAmongst the stakeholders interviewed, the agribusiness co-operative placed the greatest \nimportance on the production services of the woodland (20%), and specifically the use of \nthe woodland for timber production (14%) and employment (6%).  Of the other \nstakeholders, no stakeholder placed more than 5% on the importance of a specific \nproduction service.  In fact local residents, who ascribed a relative importance of only \n7% to production services, ascribed similar (p = 0.26) values (1 to 2%) to the use of the \nwoodland for providing timber, fuelwood, nuts and fruits and employment.  Similar \nresults were obtained from the local government authority and charitable trust woodland \nowner, and the representatives of government institutions and conservation groups \n(Table 2).  \n  \n8\nTable 2: Relative importance (%) of each of 30 ecosystem services\/dis-services of community woodlands \nas perceived by 84 local residents, three woodland owners (agribusiness co-operative, local authority, \ntrust), three representatives of government institutions, and six representatives of conservation groups.  \nNumbers above 5% are indicated in bold. \n \nServices Residents Owners Government Conservation  \n (n = 84) Agri-\nbusiness\n(n = 1) \nLocal \nauthority\n(n = 1) \nTrust \n(n = 1) \nrepresentatives \n(n = 3) \ngroups \n(n = 6) \nRegulation service       \nCarbon storage 2 2 3 2 3 3 \nFavourable climate 3 2 2 1 1 2 \nSoil protection 2 1 2 1 1 2 \nWind protection 2 1 2 1 0 2 \nDust removal 1 1 2 1 0 2 \nNoise reduction 2 1 2 1 0 4 \nFlood prevention 2 1 3 1 2 1 \nSite restoration 2 1 2 1 3 2 \nLinks to other schemes 0 0 0 1 3 0 \nHabitat service       \nWild plant\/animal 14 5 8 32 4 25 \nPlant conservation 7 5 8 2 5 9 \nDeer and game conservation 6 5 0 0 3 1 \nOther animal conservation 6 5 5 2 3 4 \nSpecies management 0 0 5 4 1 0 \nProvisioning service       \nTimber production 2 14 3 1 5 3 \nFuelwood production 1 0 5 1 2 2 \nNut and fruit production 2 0 5 5 1 2 \nEmploymenta 2 6 3 3 3 2 \nInformation service       \nWalking 6b 9 12 28 17 15 \nGame shooting 1 0 0 0 2 0 \nCultural appreciation 6 6 3 2 9 5 \nLandscape appreciation 12 6 6 2 10 6 \nEducation and research 5 6 5 2 7 1 \nHorse riding  1 0 0 2 0 0 \nUrban growth control 4 3 2 4 3 1 \nLandscape screening 3 0 2 0 1 2 \nDis-service       \nFly tipping 3 8 3 0 3 2 \nDog excrement and litter 1 6 5 0 5 1 \nDrug use 1 3 1 0 1 0 \nOther criminal activity 1 3 1 0 2 1 \nTotal 100 100 100 100 100 100 \na:  Employment was assumed to be primarily related to timber production.  \nb: Residents were only given the option of \u201cdog-walking\u201d rather than both \u201cwalking\u201d and \u201cdog-walking\u201d \n \n \n  \n9\nInformation services \nLocal residents ascribed 37% of the importance of the community woods to positive \ninformation services (Figure 1).  Although the results were not statistically significant (p \n= 0.32), local residents indicated that the most important beneficial information services \nprovided by the woodland were a scenic and beautiful landscape (12%), an opportunity \nfor dog-walking (6%), and cultural appreciation (6%) (Table 2).  Unfortunately \n\u201cwalking\u201d, as distinct from \u201cdog-walking\u201d was omitted in the questionnaire used with \nresidents.  When it was included, government institutions and the conservation groups \n(15-17%) and the charitable trust (28%) allocated a high importance to the use of the \nwoodland for walks (with and without dogs).  Beyond walking, stakeholders other than \nlocal residents, also ranked the provision of a scenic landscape (2-10%) and cultural \nvalue (2-9%) as the most important information services provided by the woodland.  The \nrelative importance placed on game shooting (0-2%), horse riding (0-2%), landscape \nscreening (0-3%), and the control of urban growth (1-4%) was relatively low. \n \nInformation dis-services \nLocal residents ascribed a relatively low level of importance (6%) to the negative \nservices or dis-services created by community woodlands (Figure 1a).  Within this total, \nthe importance placed on flying tipping (3%) was greater (p < 0.001) than that attributed \nto dog excrement and litter, drug use and criminal activities (all 1%) (Table 2).  The \nconservation groups also ascribed some importance (4%) to negative services (Figure \n1a), with the greatest importance again placed on fly tipping (Table 2).  By contrast two \nof the woodland owners, the agribusiness co-operative and the local authority, placed a \nsubstantially higher importance (10-20%) on a range of negative services including fly-\ntipping (3-8%) and dog excrement and litter (5-6%).  The three representatives of \ngovernment institutions also placed a similar importance (3-5%) on fly tipping and dog \nexcrement as problems (Table 2); by contrast in this study the charitable trust placed no \nimportance on these dis-services. \n \nDiscussion \n \nThis section first discusses the general applicability of the ecosystem function \nframework to community woodlands.  It then discusses the responses of the individual \nstakeholders and lastly considers how the framework can be used to identify and address \npotential areas of synergy or tension. \n \nApplicability of the ecosystem functions framework \nThe research showed that when participants were provided with a list of potential \necosystem services, they could use the framework to describe the perceived importance \nof those ecosystem services and the associated functions.  The framework was \nparticularly useful in providing an overarching systematic structure to the wide range of \nexisting and potential services.  Such an analysis could be particularly instructive when \nan owner considers the purpose in planting new woodland.  This is because it allows \ndifferent functions and services to be examined relative to each other, without the need \nto monetise terms, and it highlights functions and services that may otherwise have been \nignored.  Whilst community woodlands provide some services that can be allocated to an \nindividual e.g. timber production, they also produce a range of goods and services which \nare collectively consumed (Wilson & Howarth 2002) and the framework provides a \nmechanism for recognising these additional contributions to society as a whole.   \n  \n10\n \nLocal residents \nLocal residents perceived that the greatest value of community woodlands was in terms \nof the habitat and information services provided.  This is similar to Chambers and Price \n(1986), Arnberger (2006) and Ode and Fry (2006) who report that local residents placed \nprimary importance on the recreational use of woodlands.  De Groot et al. (2002) explain \nthat ecosystem functions can have economic, social and ecological values.  The focus of \nthe residents on habitat and information services implies that they primarily focussed on \necological (habitat) and social (information) values.  By contrast, the results suggest that \nthe current value placed on regulating services is relatively low.  This is in contrast to \nresearch on wetlands in Sweden which showed that local stakeholders tended to rank the \nvalue of regulating services higher than those related to recreation (Lewan and \nS\u00f6derqvuist, 2002).  It is possible that because regulating services are \u201cinvisible\u201d they \nare under-valued, and that an \u201caccurate\u201d assessment may depend on improved \nunderstanding (Hoehn et al., 2003; Lewan and S\u00f6derqvuist, 2002). \n \nWoodland owners \nThe agribusiness co-operative and the local government authority gave greatest \nimportance to information services, whilst the charitable trust placed greatest importance \non services related to habitat functions.  The charitable trust\u2019s response is in line with \ntheir stated objective of enabling the survival and evolution of the widest range of \nhabitats and species and enhancing biodiversity.  Within the information function, the \ngreatest value was placed on the use of woods for walking.  In a study of woodland \nowners\u2019 attitudes to public access provision, Church et al. (2005) report that most \nowners agree to this with only a few private owners reluctant to allow access due to \nprivacy and security reasons.  Describing the motivations of private and non-private \nland-owners for owning woodland, Church and Ravenscroft (2008) report that 73, 68, 48, \n23 and 19% of respondents mentioned wildlife habitat, landscape feature, reserve for \nnature, commercial timber and recreation respectively.  According to Church and \nRavenscroft (2008), these motivations reflect a broad view about the reasons for owning \nand managing woodlands even when they have very little commercial value.   \n \nCommercial timber production was identified as the most important ecosystem good for \nthe agribusiness co-operative which probably reflects their business objectives.  \nHowever, with the recent low price of timber and the availability of cheap imports it is \nrecognised that timber sales alone do not provide adequate revenues for many owners.  \nThe low importance (0-5% of the total value) placed on the provision of fuelwood is also \nnoteworthy in the target that by 2020 England should seek to harvest half of the \ncurrently unharvested biomass increment of woodlands as fuelwood (Forestry \nCommission, 2007).  The importance placed on fuelwood was similar to the emphasis \n(2-3% of the total value) placed on the potential of woodland to sequester carbon storage. \nCannell et al. (1999) estimate that the accumulation of carbon in unharvested trees, \nforest litter, forest soils, and undecaying timber products from UK forests represent an \nannual sink of about 2.7 Mt of carbon, or about 1.8% of annual current UK carbon \nemissions.  Hence carbon sequestration can strengthen the case for multi-purpose \nwoodland creation.      \n \n  \n11\nThe agribusiness co-operative also placed a 6% weighting on the capacity of the \nwoodland to provide employment; this was categorised as a provisioning use in the \nquestionnaire.  This was probably appropriate at Pegnut Wood where, once the trees \nwere planted, thinning to maximise wood production on the largest trees had been the \nmain on-site employment activity.  However at the other sites, people were also \nemployed to maintain rides, fences, gates and stiles, and these could relate to habitat and \ninformation functions.  More fundamentally there is the question of whether \n\u201cemployment\u201d should be categorised as an ecosystem \u201cuse\u201d or an indicator of the \n\u201cvalue\u201d, or level of human appreciation, that is placed on a use.   The distinction \nbetween \u201cuse\u201d and \u201cvalue\u201d is not always clear; for example De Groot et al. (2002) \nincludes \u201csmall-scale subsistence farming\u201d and \u201cbuilding and manufacturing\u201d within a \nlist of provisioning services for natural ecosystems.  In addition there are some foresters \nwho will gain enjoyment and utility from their employment in a woodland ecosystem in \nan analogous way to an individual who uses the ecosystem for recreation.  Nevertheless \nit is probably more rigorous to restrict the \u201cprovisioning\u201d ecosystem services to the \nproduction of woodland products (De Groot, 1992), and to use the term \u201cemployment\u201d \nin the socio-economic valuation and analysis of a range of ecosystem services.    \n \nTwo of the owners showed substantial concern that woodlands provide opportunities for \nfly tipping and the accumulation of litter and dog excrement.  These \u201cdis-services\u201d could \nbe associated with the woodland ecosystem restricting short-range visibility and creating \n\u201cprivate\u201d spaces: an ecosystem service which can be positive in other contexts.  Whereas \necosystem services are generally discussed in terms of ecosystem payments to the owner, \ndis-services can result in prevention and remediation costs and the question of who \nshould pay.  Investment may be required in some form of security, education, or regular \nmaintenance to address these and possible cumulative effects, i.e. the so called \u201cdirt \nattracts dirt principle\u201d (Irving, 1985).    \n \nGovernment institutions \nThe representative of the surveyed government institutions placed greatest value on the \ninformation function, specifically on uses such as walking, the provision of a beautiful \nlandscape, and cultural benefit.  The UK Department for the Environment, Food and \nRural Affairs (DEFRA, 2006) argues that encounters with nature, such as with \nwoodlands close to people\u2019s homes, have a positive impact on quality of life and health. \nThe Forestry Commission seeks to promote greater involvement of people and \ncommunities in order to provide a more \u201csocially inclusive resource\u201d (O\u2019Brien and \nClaridge, 2002). Such government institutions have considerable influence over land \nmanagement practices in the UK, along with other institutions that create incentive \nstructures which stimulate and enable landowners to allow public access.  For example, \nin the UK the Countryside and Rights of Way Act (2000) made a range of provisions, \nwhich included access to open countryside, reforms to rights of way and nature \nconservation (Parker and Ravenscroft, 2001).  Likewise the English Woodland Grant \nScheme provides additional payments to landowners who provide and support public \naccess to new woodlands.     \n \nConservation groups \nThe conservation groups placed greatest value on the habitat (39%) and information \n(30%) functions of the community woodlands.  Creating a habitat for wild plant and wild \nanimal species (25%) was their primary focus.  Geist and Galatowitsch (1999) recognise \n  \n12\nthe importance of conservation groups in proposing a model for successfully engaging \nsuch groups in ecological restoration for reversing losses in biodiversity.  The \nconservation groups placed minimal value on the use of the woodlands for timber \nproduction (3%).  The mutual emphasis on the provision of habitat by voluntary \nconservation groups and other stakeholders, mean that such groups can usefully work \ntogether. \n \nPotential synergies and tensions \nStakeholder ranking of the ecosystem functions and uses of community woods provides \na method for identifying areas of mutual interest between stakeholder groups, and hence \nidentify areas where they can work together.  These are important considerations for \nimplementing changes in institutional processes and arrangements put forward by Turner \net al. (2003) to realise the benefit streams from multiple ecosystem use and non-use \nprovision across a range of different stakeholders.   \n \nEach group of stakeholders placed a relatively high value on the information (30-50%) \nand habitat (16-40%) functions of community woodlands.  These observed similarities in \nperceptions of the habitat and information ecosystem functions of community woodlands \nprovide potential synergies.  In 2006, the creation in England of a new organisation \ncalled Natural England brought together the habitat-focused work of English Nature \ntogether with the community-related activities of the Countryside Agency\u2019s Landscape, \nAccess and Recreation Division.  This new organisation could provide a good forum for \nidentifying and harnessing similarities across different stakeholders.   \n \nAlthough each stakeholder group recognised the regulation function, it was not given the \nhighest priority (10-18%).  This relatively low weighting creates a challenge for those \nlike Hindmarch et al. (2006) who propose the need for a new social perspective and a \nrange of policy reforms to address awareness of ecosystem services, which are essential \nto human life.  The authors identify \u201cblindness to ecosystem services\u201d and the need for \nconcepts, methods and supporting legislative instruments to internalise the value of \necosystem services in real world accounting processes.  This would facilitate the \nimportance of ecosystem services becoming \u201ca matter of common social acceptance\u201d \n(Hindmarch et al., 2006).  This is particularly important for those services that are \n\u201cinvisible\u201d and therefore not readily perceived by the senses (Lewan and S\u00f6derqvuist \n2002) such as the regulation function.  De Groot (1992) observed that although the \nregulation function may not provide direct economic benefits it maintains and conserves \nthe environmental conditions necessary for most of the other ecosystem functions that \nprovide direct benefits.  All the stakeholders studied perceived the indirect contributions \nof the regulation function as minimal.  Lewan and S\u00f6derqvuist (2002) underscore the \nneed for the general public to gain a critical level of basic knowledge about the functions \nin nature, if these functions are to be valued in policy and economics.  In other words, \nthe public should gain some awareness to ensure public debate on issues associated with \nlocal partnerships in community woods.   \n \nOne area of potential tension is in the different values placed on community woodland \nfor the provision of timber.  This ranged from 14% for the agri-business co-operative to \n2% for local residents.  This difference could generate tensions during typical tree felling \n  \n13\nactivities.  Hence a potential issue could be how to raise awareness of the potential \nbenefits of some level of timber production in community woods.   \n \nA second area of potential tension was the perception of the negative services of \ncommunity woodland.  This was given a high priority by the agri-business owner (20%), \nwho would normally have to deal with the removal and control of goods and services \nwhich are thought to be negative, but a low value (6%) by local residents who may not \nsee it as their responsibility.  Although negative services were not included in the initial \necosystem function framework, in this study it was instructive to include those \necosystem services which have a detrimental effect on human well-being.  The need to \naddress negative services can result in real financial costs for woodland owners.  In such \nsituations, it may be fruitful to facilitate discussions between owners and other \nstakeholders as to methods to resolve such issues.  One possible approach is to integrate \nsuch an analysis of the synergies and tensions between stakeholders with the \u201cToolbox\u201d \ndescribed by Hislop et al. (2004) to provide opportunities to systematically develop \ndialogue and build partnerships between stakeholders. \n \nConclusions  \n \nThe ecosystem function framework was applied in this paper to explore the stakeholder \nperceptions on the relative value of the different functions and services associated with \ncommunity woodlands.  By starting from a consideration of the capacity of natural \nprocesses and components in the woodland (e.g. the functions of the woodland) to \nprovide goods and services, it provides a systematic structure for comparing the \nimportance of a range of goods and services in a non-monetarised way. After an initial \npilot study, it was also possible to modify the framework to consider positive and \nnegative services.  The application of the framework has highlighted the importance \nplaced on the habitat and recreation services provided by woodland, as discussed by \nother authors, but it has also shown a significant, albeit low, appreciation of regulation \nservices.  Regulating services are sometimes overlooked and the framework could be \none way of providing the new narrative, which O\u2019Brien (2004) states is needed to \ndescribe public views of woodlands in the 21st century.  \n \nSimilar levels of importance placed on some services by different stakeholders provide \nopportunities for groups working together, i.e. conservation groups working with owners \nto enhance habitat services.  By contrast, differences in levels of importance may suggest \npotential areas of tension.  For example, a production-related activity such as thinning \nundertaken by the owner may be perceived as negative by local residents whose focus is \nhabitat and recreation services.  In such cases, the ecosystem functions could provide a \nuseful heuristic framework for exploring and addressing the differences.  It should also \nbe noted that this research was limited to community woodlands where the owners had \nspecifically planted their woodlands with the intention of providing public access.  It is \nnow recommended that non-community woodlands are studied to determine if the \nperceptions of the owners are similar.   \n \n  \n14\nAcknowledgements \nWe wish to acknowledge the contributions of all the stakeholders who were contacted.  \nOlivia Agbenyega was in receipt of a research studentship from the Government of \nGhana whilst she undertook this research. \n \nReferences \nArnberger, A., 2006.
