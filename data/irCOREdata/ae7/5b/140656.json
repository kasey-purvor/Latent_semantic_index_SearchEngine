The membrane was formed\nby cathodic electropolymerisation of divinylbenzene\/ethylvinylbenzene at the surface\nof a gold coated polyester support membrane. Permeability coefficients were\ndetermined for O2 and glucose across membranes with a range of polymer\nthicknesses. Anionic interferents (such as ascorbate), were screened from the working\nelectrode via a charge exclusion mechanism. The enzyme electrode showed an initial\n10% signal drift when first exposed to whole human blood over a period of 2 hours,\nafter which responses remained essentially stable. Whole blood patient glucose\ndeterminations yielded a correlation coefficient of r2=0.99 compared to standard\nhospital analyses.\nKeywords: cathodic electropolymerisation, composite membrane, amperometric\nenzyme electrode, polydivinylbenzene, blood.\n1. Introduction\nGlucose continues to be a major target analyte for many sensors, with the focus of\nmuch of this research being driven by the growing incidence of diabetes, at the time\nof writing 170 million sufferers have been diagnosed world-wide [1] and this number\nis expected to reach 300 million by 2045 [2].\nWhen measuring whole blood samples, two problems must be overcome:\nFirstly interferents that may be present in the blood (such as ascorbate) must be\nprevented from reaching the electrode since they can be oxidised and give rise to\nerroneous readings. Secondly physiological fluids, especially blood, also have a\ntendency to deposit materials such as proteins, usually irreversibly, onto solid\nsurfaces. This biofouling process can diminish the response of sensors \u2013 and in some\ncases can passivate them completely. The solution is often to employ two separate\nfunctional membranes [3]; an outer membrane to act as a substrate diffusion limiting\nbarrier and offer favourable biocompatibility [4] along with an underlying (inner)\nmembrane that is designed to be permselective [5] and which is typically positioned\nimmediately over the working electrode to screen out interferents. Unfortunately both\nmembranes act as additional diffusional barriers through which the enzyme substrates\nand\/or H2O2 must traverse, so hindering their passage to the enzyme or working\nelectrode and thus increasing the overall response time.\nThis has lead to research towards the development of single multi-functional\nultra thin film composite membranes [6,7]. Membranes of this type have been shown\nto be capable of serving as both highly substrate diffusion limiting barriers towards\nenzyme substrates, whilst also effectively screening anionic interferents from the\nworking electrode via a charge exclusion principle [8]. The usual method for\nformation of composite membranes of this type is to deposit a homogeneous film\n(ideally 100nm thickness) of a biocompatible polymer onto a highly porous support\nmembrane, which offers mechanical support to the structure. Amperometric glucose\noxidase laminate enzyme electrodes employing such biocompatible composite\nmembranes have been found to display shortened response times [9].\nIt should be noted in this context that the separational performance of a\nhomogeneous polymer film membrane relies on its chemical properties and not on its\nthickness per se, whereas the rate at which the separation can occur is dependent on\nthe thickness of the membrane. It therefore follows that the thinner a membrane is, the\nbetter will be its performance also. On the other hand it should be appreciated that if a\nmembrane is made too thin, it will become excessively fragile and thus be rendered\nuseless. A membrane of substantially reduced thickness which could offer the\nrequired separational performance, whilst still possessing the mechanical strength of a\nconventional contemporary membrane, would therefore clearly be highly\nadvantageous.\nElectrodeposition affords the possibility of accurate control of the location and\nthickness of a deposited polymer film. The active species e.g. an enzyme can be\nincorporated within the polymeric film [10].\nA second approach is to combine an active layer such as a chemically\ncrosslinked film of glucose oxidase - which is either directly deposited onto or\nlaminated to a supported electro-deposited membrane on an electrode. Once\ndeposited, this active layer is then covered with the permselective composite\nmembrane which both screens out interferents and offers favourable biocompatibility.\nPrevious work within out group has utilised highly porous commercial alumina\nmembranes as supports for ultra-thin polydivinylbenzene\/ethylvinylbenzene\n(DVB\/EVB) or polyacrylonitrile films [11,12]. However the alumina support\nmembranes were somewhat inflexible and brittle. The next aim of this work was\nfocussed towards developing this sensor further by increasing its mechanical\nflexibility and so increasing the possible scope of application within sensors for\npractical applications.\nThis paper describes the development and use of an ultra-thin\npolydivinylbenzene\/ethylvinylbenzene (DVB\/EVB) film composite membrane, with\nan effective diffusional barrier thickness of approximately 50 nm, for the optimisation\nof a glucose biosensor for whole blood glucose determinations. The performance of a\nvariety of composite membranes as substrate diffusion limiting barrier were\ndetermined. The biocompatibility as well as the ability to screen anionic interferent\nsolutes within patient blood samples were also investigated. A model glucose oxidase\nenzyme electrode was also fabricated for the determination of glucose levels in patient\nwhole blood samples. The results are compared to standard hospital analyses for the\nsame patient samples. The advantages of this system over many of the other glucose\nsensors reported are the control of membrane thickness conferred by electrochemical\ndeposition and the flexibility of the resultant glucose sensor.\n2. Experimental\n2.1 Reagents and Membranes\nN\u2019N-dimethylformamide, tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (electrochemical grade)\nand divinylbenzene (70-85% DVB, 15-30% 3- and 4- EVB, containing 0.1%\npolymerisation inhibitor: 4-tert-butylcatechol) were all purchased from Fluka\nChemicals (Dorset, England).\nD-glucose, disodium hydrogen phosphate (Na2HPO4), sodium dihydrogen\nphosphate (NaH2PO4) and sodium chloride (NaCl) were all obtained from BDH\n(Poole, Dorset). Glucose oxidase from Asperigillus niger (75% protein 150,000\nunits\/g solid), bovine serum albumin (fraction V) and glutaraldehyde (grade II, 25%\naqueous solution) were all purchased from the Sigma Chemical Company (Poole\nDorset, UK).\nAluminium oxide Chromatography Grade was obtained from F.S.A.\nLaboratory Supplies (Loughborough, UK). Granular calcium hydride was purchased\nfrom Fisher Scientific (Leicestershire, UK).\nElectrolube \u00ae silver conductive paint (Electrolube\u00ae Ltd, Berkshire) was\npurchased from Maplins Electronics, Manchester, UK and used for the fabrication of\nAu counter electrodes. ElectroDag\u00ae silver paint was purchased from Agar Scientific\nLtd, for electron microscopy sample preparations.\nCycloporeTM 0.2 \u00b5m and 0.4 \u00b5m polyester membranes, 0.2 \u00b5m PTFE\nmembranes, 0.2 \u00b5m nylon membranes and 0.45 \u00b5m polypropylene membranes were\npurchased from Whatman International, Maidstone, UK. 0.015\u00b5m pore diameter\npolycarbonate membranes (Poretics Corporation, Livermore, USA) were used as the\nlower membranes within enzyme\/membrane laminates [9].\n2.2 Buffers and Solutions\nA phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) comprising 5.28 x 10-2 M Na2HPO4, 1.3 x 10-3 M\nNaH2PO4 and 5.1 x 10-3 M NaCl in deionised water was used for the preparation of all\nsolutions for diffusion chamber mass transport investigations and glucose calibration\nmeasurements.\n2.3 Preparation of Conductive faced Membrane Electrodes and Counter Electrodes\nIn order to electropolymerise the DVB\/EVB monomer onto the host membranes, the\nuppermost surface was first rendered electrically conductive by Au sputter coating the\nmembranes with an Edwards S150 B sputter coater in a similar manner as used for\nelectron microscopy sample preparation [8]. The gold-coated membranes were then\nattached to multicore wires using fluxless solder and were then used as working\nelectrode assemblies for the electrochemical preparation of thin polymer film\ncomposite membranes.\nGold counter electrodes were constructed by coating glass slides in a similar\nmanner and attaching multicore wires via the application of \u2018Electrolube\u2019 silver\nconductive paint. A further coating of epoxy resin served to insulate the\nwire\/electrode joint, whilst also enhancing the mechanical strength of the electrode.\n2.4 Removal of Polymerisation Inhibitor present in as-received Divinylbenzene\nPrior to the polymerisation of the divinylbenzene, the polymerisation inhibitor (4-tert\nbutylcatechol) was removed from the as-received monomer as previously described\n[11]. It must be noted, however, that the monomer preparation consisted of a mixture\nof 70-85% divinylbenzene plus 0.1% polymerisation inhibitor with the rest of solution\nconstituting 3- and 4-ethylvinylbenzene. Since no attempt was made to separate the\nDVB from the EVB, the resulting polymer films obtained are copolymers of the two\nstyrenic monomers.\nThe as-received DVB\/EVB was extracted 10 times with 5% aqueous sodium\nhydroxide to remove the 4-tert-butylcatechol. The extract produced was washed six\ntimes with high purity de-ionised water and then passed through a column of neutral\nactivated aluminium oxide onto granular calcium hydride. The inhibitor free\ndivinylbenzene was then stored at 4oC over calcium hydride prior to use.\n2.5 Enzyme Laminate Fabrication\nThe enzyme laminate employed in the resulting enzyme electrode was produced by\nfirst forming a GOD\/BSA solution comprising glucose oxidase (2560 units\/ml) and\nbovine serum albumin (0.1mg ml-1) dissolved in buffer. 3\u00b5l glutaraldehyde (5% v\/v in\nbuffer) was then added to 6\u00b5l GOD\/BSA solution and mixed rapidly. The\nenzyme\/glutaraldehyde mixture was then placed on a 1cm2 portion of (0.015\u00b5m pore)\npolycarbonate membrane and a second 1cm2 portion of the polydivinylbenzene\ncomposite membrane (polymer coating face up) placed on top. Using glass slides, the\ncrosslinked enzyme laminate was then compressed under gentle finger pressure for\napproximately 5 minutes.\n2.6 Enzyme electrode glass cell for whole blood glucose determinations\nA bespoke glass electrochemical cell was utilised as before [11], Figure 1, for enzyme\nelectrode blood glucose determinations. This glass cell consisted of two halves\nclamped together. The base was constructed with a flat circular surface, at the centre\nof which was a platinum working electrode of 2mm diameter. The polymer coated\ncomposite membrane laminate was positioned over the platinum electrode of the cell\n(polarised at +650mV vs. Ag\/AgCl) and sealed in place with an \u2018O-ring\u2019 to follow the\ndetection of H2O2. The upper half of the cell acted as a chamber into which solutions\nand reference and counter electrodes were introduced. A circular hole in the base of\nthis served to expose the underlying working electrode to the solution. A further\ncircular indentation was made in the underside surface of the solution well to house\nthe O-ring. A silver electrode was placed vertically into the main chamber of the cell\nto act as a combined counter and reference electrode. The enzyme laminate was\npositioned over the Pt working electrode with the polymer-coated surface positioned\nuppermost.\n2.7 Investigation into Solute Permeability Coefficients\nThe mass transport, and therefore permeability coefficients, of both oxygen and\nglucose across a range of ultra-thin polymer composite membranes were determined\nusing conventional diffusion chamber apparatus as previously described [5]. A Rank\nOxygen Electrode assembly (as previously described [5]) was used for the\ndetermination of oxygen levels within solution, whilst a glucose enzyme electrode\n(again as previously described [5]), was fabricated for the determination of glucose\nlevels.\n2.8 Scanning Electron Microscopy\nBare polymer membranes and a range of polymer coated composite membranes were\nstudied using a Phillips XL30 FEG Scanning Electron Microscope. Samples were\nmounted onto aluminium microscopy stages by applying a small amount of silver\nconductive \u2018ElectroDag\u2019 (415M) paint around the sample perimeter.\n3. Results\n3.1 Selection of membrane.\nThe membranes were tested to determine their permeability to glucose. It is intended\nthat the polymer film acts as the substrate diffusion limiting factor in the assembly, not\nthe membrane itself, and so the ideal membrane chosen for this study would act as a\nhighly permeable, microporous mechanical support for the polymer film. It was\ntherefore intended that the membrane found to posses the greatest permeability to\nglucose solution should be chosen.\nThe polypropylene and PTFE membranes were so hydrophobic that the\nglucose solution could not penetrate the membrane and zero permeability was\nobserved. The highest permeability was observed for the 0.4 \uf06dm polyester membrane\n(12.5 x 10-7 cm2 s-1) compared with 3.8 x 10-7 cm2 s-1 for the 0.2 \uf06dm polyester\nmembrane, 2.5 x 10-7 cm2 s-1 for the nylon membrane and 9.7 x 10-7 cm2 s-1 for the\nalumina membranes studied previously [11]. Therefore the 0.4 \uf06dm polyester\nmembrane was selected as the substrate for sensor optimisation.\n3.2. The Electrodeposition of polyDVB\/EVB onto Polyester Host Support\nMembranes\nEarlier work with polyDVB\/EVB-coated alumina membranes [11] demonstrated the\nmost dramatic changes in mass transport properties occur following the deposition of\npolymer within the first few potential cycles, with the relative difference between P\nvalues for membranes coated via 5 or 50 potential cycles being small. In this work\nmembranes (with a nominal pore diameter of 0.4\uf06dm) were for this reason coated\nusing 1, 2, 3, 5 and 10 potential cycles.\nThe cyclic voltammograms obtained for the electrodeposition of\npolyDVB\/EVB onto polyester are shown in Figure 2 and are dissimilar to the\nvoltammograms produced via deposition on alumina [11].\n3.3. Investigation of Surface Topography using the Scanning Electron Microscope\nScanning electron microscopy images show the polyester membrane surface to be\ncovered by a coating of polymer after 2 potential sweeps (Figure 3b), in comparison\nto the bare membrane (Figure 3a). The underlying trans-membranous pores are still\nvisible in the structure, since the polymer surface follows the contours of the\nmembrane, producing a polymer surface that appears \u2018pitted\u2019. This may be explained\nby taking into consideration that the formation of polymer also occurs within the\ntrans-membranous pores. These pores create channels in which diffusion of soluble\npolymer is limited, resulting in an increased concentration of soluble polymer\nmolecules forming and becoming contained within each pore. These areas within the\npores that possess a high concentration of soluble polymer will reach the critical\ngel-point of polymerisation earlier than in areas such as the membrane surface, where\ndiffusion away from the electrode is possible. By reaching the critical gel-point at an\nearlier stage, the polymer layer formed within each pore will be thinner than that\nformed at the surface, where the potential window for soluble polymer formation is\ngreater. The \u2018pitted\u2019 appearance of the polymer film will not, however, affect the\npermeability properties of the membrane, since the passage of substrates through the\nmembrane occurs only through these pores, which, if blocked, will still act as\neffective substrate diffusion limiting barriers. Figure 3c shows the surface of a\npolyester membrane coated with polyDVB\/EVB via 10 potential scans, in which the\npores are clearly blocked.\n3.4. Investigation into film thickness via Charge Integration and SEM Techniques\nThe cumulative thickness of polymer film deposited was estimated by integrating the\ncharge underneath each polymerisation curve [11]. Assuming via molecular\nmodelling that the cross-sectional dimensions of a polyDVB\/EVB monomer unit are\n\uf07e8.06 \u00c5 and\uf07e5.28\u00c5 respectively and that the monolayer depth is \uf07e1.5 \u00c5 - the polymer\nfilm thickness may be predicted to be less than 50nm.\nA scanning electron micrograph of the cross section of a polyester membrane\ncoated via 10 sweeps shows the polymer film thickness to be approximately 50nm,\nindicating that an ultra-thin-polymer composite membrane has been fabricated (Figure\n3d).\n3.5. Enzyme Immobilisation\nThe prototype sensor described in this chapter was designed to electrochemically\nquantify the levels of glucose present in whole blood, and so the enzyme glucose\noxidase was immobilised at the working electrode surface via crosslinking with\nbovine serum albumin. The immobilised enzyme was then entrapped between a\npolycarbonate membrane and an upper polyDVB\/EVB-coated polyester membrane.\nIn the same way as the sensors designed previously [11], the prototype sensor\nrelies on the catalytic oxidation of glucose by the enzyme glucose oxidase, a reaction\nthat requires both glucose and oxygen. The mass transport properties of both\nsubstrates were therefore investigated in order to identify the most suitable membrane\nfor the application.\n3.6. The Determination of Permeability Coefficients\nThe first few potential sweeps are responsible for the blocking of the membrane\npores, after which successive potential cycles contribute to the cumulative thickness\nof solid polymer formed. It must be remembered here that although the surface of a\nmembrane coated via 2 cycles may still appear to possess some unblocked pores\n(Figure 3b), this may not be the case. It is possible that thin films of polymer may\nhave formed within these pores that are not yet thick enough to be visible via electron\nmicroscopy at the membrane surface.\nGlucose P values decrease steadily with successive potential cycles,\nreinforcing the theory that polymer is being progressively deposited at the membrane\nsurface. The glucose P values depicted in Figure 4a show a sudden drop occurring\nfollowing the application of the first potential cycle, however this may be attributed to\nthe blocking of membrane pores, so that glucose must partition through the polymer\nfilm itself, rather than within aqueous solution. Not all membrane pores may be\ncompletely blocked at this point, however, since the P values for oxygen indicate that\nit is after the second potential cycle that the mass transport of oxygen molecules\nthrough the membrane is most greatly hindered.\nThe oxygen P values also decrease (Figure 4b) with each successive polymer\ncoating applied as the film coats the underlying membrane with increasing layers of\npolymer. The greatest lowering of the permeability coefficients for the mass transport\nof oxygen through the membrane occurs following the initial first and second\npotential cycles. After this point the P values decrease at a lowered rate with each\nsuccessive potential sweep.\nThis difference in P values can be explained by the larger glucose molecule\nmeeting increased resistance to the diminishing pore size and thickening polymer film\nafter the first potential cycle. The smaller oxygen molecule may still be able to diffuse\nthrough any small pinhole areas of the pores that remain unblocked, whereas the\nglucose must partition through the polymer film itself. Following the application of\nthe second polymerisation potential cycle, both substrates must partition across the\npolymer film in order to traverse the membrane.\nThis mass transport behaviour would suggest that, although not visible at the\nsurface, the vast majority of the membrane pores have some amount of polymer\nformed within or across them after 2 potential cycles.\nAfter approximately 10 potential sweeps, a small number of the membranes\nstudied began to show some deterioration, with the surface of the polymer-coated\ngold layer exhibiting some cracking (Figure 5). This, in turn, affected the\nreproducibility of the oxygen and glucose P values for these membranes.\nThe glucose\/oxygen P ratios for the range of polyDVB\/EVB-coated polyester\nmembranes are shown in Figure 4c. It has been shown that the passage of glucose\nthrough the membrane is most greatly affected after the application of the first\npotential cycle, and this is reflected in the initial large drop in glucose\/oxygen P ratio.\nThe main mechanism of mass transport of glucose through this membrane involves\npartitioning through the polymer film. It is possible however, that at this point the\nsmaller oxygen molecule may still be traversing the membrane through small holes in\nthe pores that remain unblocked. The relative increased resistance offered to the\noxygen molecules after the second potential cycle therefore causes a slight increase in\nthe glucose\/oxygen P ratio, as partitioning becomes the primary method of mass\ntransport for both enzyme substrates.\nFollowing the third potential cycle, all membrane pores become blocked by\npolymer and so with subsequent polymer layers deposited, the glucose\/oxygen P ratio\ncontinues to decrease steadily. After 10 potential cycles have been performed the\nglucose\/oxygen P values increase. This is due to some membranes showing\ndeterioration, as depicted in Figure 5.\n3.7. Calibration and Comparison of a Range of Glucose Sensors Incorporating\nFlexible Thin-Film PolyDVB\/EVB Composite Membranes\nA range of glucose oxidase enzyme electrodes were constructed, with each\nelectrode employing a flexible composite membrane produced via 1, 2, 3, 5 and 10\npotential sweeps. Calibration curves were obtained over a concentration range of\n0mM to 30mM glucose in phosphate buffer (Figure 6). All membranes served as\neffective limiting barriers to the diffusion of both the enzyme substrates and for each\nsuccessive polymer coating deposited the amperometric responses recorded became\nprogressively linearised. Response times for all sensors were found to be <1 minute.\nSensors with as few as 2 layers showed good response and linearity but tended\ntowards a plateau above 20 mM glucose; thicker films such as 5 layers displayed\nlower responses but enhanced linearity beyond 30 mM glucose.\n3.8. Exclusion of Electroactive Interferents Present in Human Whole Blood\nAs described previously [11] the highly substrate diffusion limiting composite\nmembranes based on alumina membranes permitted the effective exclusion of anionic\ninterferents due to a charge exclusion principle. The composite membranes produced\nin this work consisted of polyDVB\/EVB coated onto polyester support membranes,\nwhich functioned as effective substrate diffusion limiting barriers. A flexible\nultra-thin polyDVB\/EVB composite membrane coated via 5 potential cycles was\nemployed as the upper covering membrane in a whole blood glucose sensor, since this\nmembrane displayed the lowest glucose\/oxygen P ratio, along with good polymer\ncoverage and increased linearisation of response. The enzyme electrode was then\nevaluated for its ability to screen anionic interferents in this way.\nAscorbate is normally used as the most significant compound with glucose\nsensors in tests of interference. The sensor was exposed to glucose both in the absence\nand presence of 1mM ascorbate and it was found that the enzyme electrode response\nwas not significantly affected by the presence of ascorbate until 15mM glucose was\nadded. The response was found to increase by 5nA at a concentration of 15mM\nglucose and 7nA after 30mM glucose was added, therefore demonstrating screening\nof ascorbate under conditions of lower glucose concentration in a similar manner to\nprevious findings within our laboratory [6, 8, 11]. In this context we have previously\nshown that under conditions of low glucose flux, the anionic enzyme\/albumin matrix\nprevented the passage of anionic solutes to the underlying electrode [6]. It appears\nthat interferent contributions (due to a fixed concentration) only become significant\nwhen the enzyme layer experiences a higher glucose flux. Here, it is probable that\ndespite ambient solution buffering, the enzyme catalysed production of\ngluconolactone (and therefore gluconic acid) will lower the local enzyme layer pH,\nand the protective barrier action of the enzyme layer will be diminished [6]. The\neffects of ascorbate under conditions of high glucose flux are lower for the\nmembranes described here than for the alumina based membranes [11], perhaps\nindicating a better quality film and more effective exclusion of ascorbate.\n3.9. Assessment of Composite Membrane Performance within a Working Glucose\nSensor for Human Whole Blood Determinations\nIn the same way as described earlier [11], a GOD enzyme electrode possessing a\npolyDVB\/EVB-coated (5 cycles) upper covering membrane was used for the\nconstruction of a working sensor for whole blood glucose determinations. The\nenzyme electrode was exposed to whole blood for 2 hours prior to patient sample\ndeterminations for glucose. Responses to 5mM glucose buffer samples indicated a\nloss of approximately 10% during this time \u2013 after which time the response of the\nsensor remained almost stable. Previous results have indicated that enzyme electrodes\npossessing stable baselines facilitate the analysis of multiple blood samples. This loss\nof enzyme electrode response observed during the first two hours of exposure to\nblood is caused by initial biofouling effects and need not cause any further problems\nwith analyses. The sensors described earlier [11] experienced a greater loss of\nresponse (32%) following its exposure to blood. This may be due to the polyester\nmembrane offering enhanced haemo\/biocompatibility over the alumina membrane.\nNo further loss of response was observed following this period and so it may\ntherefore be treated as a pre-conditioning step. Enzyme electrodes were therefore\npre-exposed to blood and re-calibrated prior to the determination of blood glucose\nsamples. Patient blood samples were supplied by a local hospital biochemistry\nlaboratory and stored in fluoride-oxalate containers to prevent glucose metabolism via\nthe blood cells prior to analyses. Blood glucose analyses via the enzyme electrode are\ncompared in Figure 7 to standard hospital biochemistry laboratory analyses for the\nsame samples. The blood glucose analyses via the enzyme electrode showed a very\nclose correlation of r2=0.99 when compared to the hospital laboratory analyses. This\nis superior to the results for alumina membranes [11] which gave a correlation of\nr2=0.97.\n3.10. Investigation of Membrane Surface Biofouling Effects\nPolyester is a highly biocompatible material and is, for example, used to surgically\nreplace artificial blood vessels [12, 13]. Scanning electron microscopy images of bare\npolyester membranes that have been exposed to blood for a period of 2 hours showed\nno obvious biofouling (Figure 8a). The polyDVB\/EVB-coated alumina membranes\nhave already been shown to offer enhanced haemo\/biocompatibility [11] and\npolymer-coated polyester membranes again offer this characteristic. Figure 8b shows\na scanning electron microscopy image of a polyDVB\/EVB-coated polyester\nmembrane following exposure to whole human blood for 2 hours.\n4. Conclusions\nFlexible ultra-thin-polyDVB\/EVB composite membranes have been electrochemically\nfabricated and successfully employed as the outer covering barrier in a model glucose\nsensor for whole blood glucose determinations, demonstrating their applicability for\nsensor systems.\nScanning the working electrode potential between 0 V and \u20134 V (vs. Ag) via\n1, 2, 3, 5 and 10 cycles produced a range of composite membranes. As the pores of\nthe underlying polyester membranes became increasingly blocked with polymer, the\nglucose\/O2 P ratios decreased, as both solutes begin to partition through the polymer\nfilm to reach the enzyme matrix.\nThe enzyme electrode was fabricated using a composite membrane produced\nvia 5 potential cycles and calibration curves obtained for known quantities of glucose.\nThe composite membrane was found to serve both as an excellent substrate diffusion\nlimiting barrier and the linearity of sensor responses was found to increase with\nincreasing polymer coatings. The use of such composite membranes proved to be an\neffective means for screening against electroactive interferents via a charge exclusion\nmechanism. The underlying polyester membrane proved to be a suitably\nbiocompatible support for the polymer film, which also displayed favourable\nbiocompatibility, thereby helping minimise surface biofouling effects. Compared with\nour previous work on alumina membranes [11], the polyester membrane sensors\nwithin this work displayed superior physical properties (flexible, non-brittle) and\nbetter correlation between sensor response and standard hospital analyses for glucose\nin whole blood samples. Future work could involve use of other electrodeposited\nmaterials to optimise performance and exclusion of interferents.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank the EPSRC for a PhD studentship for K.
