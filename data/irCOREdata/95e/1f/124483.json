We examine data taken by the Cassini spacecraft in Saturn's post-dawn magnetosphere, similar to 17.5 Saturn radii from the planet, and identify an example of return flow from magnetotail reconnection. The flow included water group ions and had elevated ion temperatures (of order 1 keV), consistent with Vasyliunas cycle return flow.
