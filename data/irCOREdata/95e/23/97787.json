Introduction\n[2] Electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves can\nbe excited by an anisotropic distribution of energetic ring\ncurrent ions, with energies near a few tens of keV. Previous\nstudies [e.g, Gomberoff and Neira, 1983, Young et al., 1981;\nHorne and Thorne, 1993, Jordanova et al., 1997] have\nshown that the generation and propagation characteristics of\nEMIC waves in a multi\u2010ion (H+; He+; O+) plasma are pro-\nfoundly controlled by ion fractional composition and by the\nratio of electron plasma to gyro frequency wpe\/\u2223We\u2223. EMIC\nwaves can also be guided by density gradients at the plas-\nmapause, which keep the wave normal angle small and sig-\nnificantly enhance the path integrated gain [Thorne and\nHorne, 1997]. Previous observational studies have shown\nthat EMIC waves are enhanced during magnetic storms\n[Br\u00e4ysy et al., 1998, Erlandson and Ukhorskiy, 2001 with the\nmost intense emissions confined to the dusk sector [Meredith\net al., 2003], consistent with the drift path of injected ring\ncurrent ions into the storm time plasmapause and plume\n[Cornwall and Schulz, 1971, Jordanova et al., 2006] and the\nexcitation of detached subauroral proton arcs [Spasojevi\u0107\net al., 2004, Jordanova et al., 2007]. The present paper\ndescribes the first attempt to model the global excitation and\nspectral properties of inner magnetospheric EMIC waves\nduring storm conditions under a new grant from the NASA\nHeliophysics Theory program, using a combination of three\nwell established models described below.\n[3] EMIC waves excited during storms can also resonate\nwith relativistic electrons, causing rapid scattering loss [Thorne\nand Kennel, 1971, Lyons and Thorne, 1973, Jordanova et al.,\n2008], but the minimum energy for electron resonance is\nstrongly dependent on ion composition and plasma density\n[Summers and Thorne, 2003, Albert, 2003, Li et al., 2007].\nSpecifically, the electron resonant energy is significantly\nreduced for EMIC waves just below the He+ ion gyrofre-\nquency, which can be excited by an anisotropic distribution of\nring current H+ [Kozyra et al., 1984, Horne and Thorne,\n1993] with energies near a few keV [Meredith et al., 2003].\nIt has been shown that the wave gain just below the He+\ngyrofrequency is much greater than that just below the O+ and\nH+ gyrofrequency [Horne and Thorne, 1993, 1994]. A sta-\ntistical study of EMIC waves observed on CRRES [Meredith\net al., 2003] showed that the minimum resonant energy for\nelectrons was generally \u2265 2 MeV for the majority of EMIC\nwave events, but about 11% of reported EMIC events had\nminimum resonant energy <2 MeV. These observed EMIC\nwaves interacting with such low\u2010energy electrons were in\nthe He+ band with wave frequency very close to He+\ngyrofrequency. EMICwaveswith amplitude up to 10 nT have\nbeen observed during the main phase of magnetic storms\n[Erlandson and Ukhorskiy, 2001], capable of inducing rapid\nscattering of relativistic electrons at a rate comparable to the\nstrong diffusion limit [Shprits et al., 2009]. Such relativistic\nelectron loss is confined to high\u2010density regions just inside\n1Department of Atmospheric Sciences, University of California, Los\nAngeles, California, USA.\n2Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico, USA.\n3British Antarctic Survey, Natural Environment Research Council,\nCambridge, UK.\nCopyright 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148\u20100227\/10\/2009JA015075\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 115, A07209, doi:10.1029\/2009JA015075, 2010\nA07209 1 of 13\nthe plasmapause or within dayside drainage plumes [Thorne\net al., 2006, Jordanova et al., 2008]. Electron density\ninside such storm time plumes exhibits fine\u2010scale structures\n[Goldstein et al., 2004, Spasojevi\u0107 et al., 2003, 2004].\nRecently, Chen et al. [2009] has shown this density struc-\nture can enhance the wave excitation, especially at fre-\nquencies close to the He+ gyrofrequency, and thus reduce\nthe electron minimum resonant energy to below 2 MeV.\n[4] Instability of EMIC waves has been studied for\nplasmas with various types of proton distributions, e.g.,\nbi\u2010Maxwellian distribution [Horne and Thorne, 1993, 1994,\nChen et al., 2009] and kappa distribution [Summers and\nThorne, 1991; Xiao et al., 2007]. Due to inhomogeneity of\nthe magnetosphere (e.g., spatial variation of thermal plasma\ndensity and the Earth\u2019s magnetic field), propagation char-\nacteristics must be carefully taken into account when one\nconsiders the excitation of EMIC waves in this environment.\nThe HOTRAY code was initially designed to calculate the\npath\u2010integrated gain of plasma waves in a fully hot plasma\nwhere each species is modeled by a combination of one or\nmore bi\u2010Maxwellian components. However, during storm\nconditions, the injected hot proton distribution can be far\nfrom Maxwellian. Consequently, in this initial study of\nEMIC wave excitation on the global scale, we introduce a\nnew technique to evaluate the path integrated wave gain\n(Figure 1). The Ring current\u2010Atmosphere interactions Model\n(RAM) is used to simulate the evolution of ring current ions\nphase space density (PSD) and plasmaspheric density during\nthe 21 April 2001 storm, driven by the convection electric\nfield and flux boundary conditions provided by the Rice\nConvectionModel (RCM) code. Ray tracing with HOTRAY,\ntogether with the formulation of Kennel [1966] to evaluate\nlocal convective growth rate, using the ion distribution\nfunctions obtained from RAM, is used to simulate the global\ndistribution of EMIC wave gain.\n[5] The outline of this paper is as follows. In section 2, the\nring current and thermal plasma density model obtained\nfrom the combined RAM and RCM simulation is described.\nA ray tracing technique is used in section 3 to study the\npropagation characteristics of EMIC waves in the He+ band,\nand the path\u2010integrated gain is also evaluated for the ring\ncurrent proton distribution obtained from the RAM simu-\nlation. The results for the global distribution of EMIC wave\nexcitation and their spectral properties are presented and\ntheir ability to scatter MeV electrons is evaluated in section 4.\nFinally, we summarize our principal conclusions and discuss\nthe relevance of our findings to future modeling of global ring\ncurrent and radiation belt dynamics.\n2. Ring Current Modeling\n[6] A NASA Heliophysics Theory project was initiated at\nUCLA in 2008, aimed at developing a global model for\nthe origin of two dominant magnetospheric plasma waves\n(Chorus and EMIC waves), which affect the dynamical\nbehavior of ring current and radiation belt particles. This\nobjective can be achieved by combining three codes (see\nflowchart in Figure 1): RCM [Toffoletto et al., 2003, and\nreferences therein], RAM [Jordanova et al., 1996, 1997, and\nreferences therein] and the HOTRAY code [Horne, 1989].\nThe RCM is an established physical model of the middle\nmagnetosphere and plasma sheet that includes coupling to\nthe ionosphere, by using a multifluid formalism to describe\nadiabatically drifting isotropic particle distributions in a\nself\u2010consistently computed electric field and a specified\nmagnetic field. The Tsyganenko 96 (T96) magnetic field\nmodel [Tsyganenko, 1995, 1996] is used for this study. The\nRCM is used to treat the transport of ions and electrons into\nthe inner magnetosphere from the distant plasma sheet,\nmodeling the proton and electron energy spectra with iso-\ntropic particle velocity space distributions for both species.\nThe RCM\u2019s outer boundary is set at \u224820 RE, the proton and\nelectron energy spectra at the boundary is established as a\nfunction of MLT and the interplanetary conditions, based on\nanalysis of 11 years (1995\u20132005) of the Geotail LEP elec-\ntron and ion fluxes from \u22480.04 to 40 keV data and the\nGeotail EPIC ion data (46 to 3000 keV) and assuming all\nions are protons [Wang et al., 2007, Gkioulidou et al.,\n2009]. The time\u2010dependent cross polar\u2010cap potential drop\n(DFPCP) and the Z component of interplanetary magnetic\nFigure 1.

To establish the\ninitial condition for the RCM, we first ran the simulation\nunder a time\u2010independent D FPCP of 30 kV with quiet time\nT96 fields (IMF Bz = 0 nT) until it reached a steady state.\nThis steady state is used as the initial condition. The electric\nfield distribution in the inner magnetosphere modeled by the\nRCM is maintained self\u2010consistently with the plasma pressure\nby taking into account the effect of the ionosphere through the\nfield\u2010aligned current and thus the effect of the penetrating\nand shielding electric fields [Toffoletto et al., 2003].\n[7] The energy spectrum modeled by the RCM at geo-\nsynchronous orbit (\u22486.6 RE) is used to derive the energetic\nparticle distribution function at the outer boundary condition\n(or source population) for the RAM simulation. Since the\nRCM assumes isotropic particle distributions for both elec-\ntrons and protons, the ion composition and pitch angle\nanisotropy of ring current ions at this outer boundary is\ninferred from empirical studies as a function of solar and\ngeomagnetic activity [Young et al., 1982, Roeder et al.,\n2005]. Subsequently, the RAM code solves fundamental\nkinetic equations to simulate the evolution of the distribution\nfunction of ring current electrons and ions, including H+, He+\nand O+ with energy from 500 eV to 400 keV, in the inner\nmagnetosphere 2.0 \u2264 L \u2264 6.5. The RAM simulation takes into\naccount various loss and transport processes including charge\nexchange, Coulomb collisions, atmospheric loss, escape from\nmagnetopause, convective transport, gradient drifting and\nradial diffusion. The RAM code is coupled with a plasma-\nspheric model [Rasmussen et al., 1993] that was developed\nfurther to use an arbitrary electric field by Jordanova et al.\n[2006]. Therefore, the electric field output from the RCM is\nused to drive both the plasmaspheric density model and the\nconvective transport of ring current ions.\n[8] The RAM code was used to simulate ring current\nspecies evolution during the 21 April 2001 storm for a 72 h\nperiod with t = 0 h defined as 00UT on 21 April. Two in-\ntervals, t = 40 (Dst min) and t = 48 h (recovery phase), have\nbeen selected to evaluate the global distribution of EMIC\nwaves in this study. The equatorial plasmaspheric electron\nFigure 2. RCM and RAM simulation of the 21 April 2001 storm during the main phase, t = 40 h.

The temperature\nanisotropy here is defined as T?\/T k \u2212 1, where T? and T k are\nthe temperature perpendicular and parallel to the ambient\nmagnetic field. At t = 40 h, a high\u2010density plume has formed\non the duskside. Ring current ions are injected from the\nplasma sheet, forming a partial ring current in the night sector,\n3 < L < 5. Electric potential from the RCM simulation shows\nshielding on the nightside at L < 3 and convergence of electric\nfield in the postmidnight sector, which results in field\u2010aligned\ncurrent and thus ionosphere\u2010magnetosphere interaction. Large\nring current H+ anisotropy (>1) develops at lower L shells (<3)\non the nightside mostly due to rapid charge exchange loss\n[Jordanova et al., 1996], and at 3.5 < L < 5.5 on the dayside\ndue to collisional losses and energy\u2010dependent drifting\n[Jordanova et al., 1999]. The total ring current H+ number\ndensity maximizes at 3.5 < L < 4.5 on the nightside where the\nanisotropy is quite low (<0.5), and then decreases away from\nthe nightside. During the storm recovery phase (Figure 3),\nthe plume narrows and rotates eastward. The convergence of\nelectric field extends to the dawnside, leading to an increase in\nring current ion density on the dawnside, especially for low\u2010\nenergy ions. The partial ring current becomes more sym-\nmetric. Ring current proton anisotropy is further enhanced on\nthe nightside and duskside, and the ring current proton\nnumber density increases on the dayside and duskside.\n[9] The H+ PSD during the main phase (t = 40 h) and\nrecovery phase (t = 48 h) at the locations L = 4.5 at midnight\n(MLT = 00), dusk (MLT = 18) and noon (MLT = 12) are\nshown in Figure 4. The PSD at midnight (Figures 4a and 4b)\nis essentially bi\u2010Maxwellian with a loss cone feature of a\nfew degrees and T? > Tk, as a result of injection on the\nnightside. The PSD in the dusk sector (Figures 4c and 4d),\nhowever, shows a ring\u2010type distribution with a pronounced\npeak along the v? axis at about T? = 11 keV at t = 40 h and\n7 keV at t = 48 h (5.2 keV in energy is equivalent to 106 ms\u22121\nin velocity for H+ species.). This feature develops over the\nMLT range between prenoon and the duskside as a result\nof energy\u2010dependent particle injection. Ring current ions of\nintermediate energy (\u2248 a few keV) have little access to this\nlocation; ions above 10 keV follow drift paths dominated by\nwestward gradient drift, while ions below 1 keV are pre-\ndominately subject to electric field drift in the eastward\ndirection [Jordanova1 et al., 1999 and references therein]. As\na consequence of the energy\u2010dependent injection, a pro-\nFigure 3.

Examples of phase space density of ring current protons simulated by the RAM code: at L =\n4.5 during the storm main phase (t = 40 h) and recovery (t = 48 h) at three different MLT, showing the\nevolution of ion ring distribution at dusk and on the dayside.\nCHEN ET AL.: GLOBAL SIMULATION OF EMIC WAVES A07209A07209\n5 of 13\nnounced separate low\u2010energy component (energy less than a\nfew keV) develops on the dayside. This isolated feature also\nextends to the duskside during the recovery phase (Figure 4d)\nbut not during the main phase (Figure 4c), because of the time\ndelay (\u2248 of hours) for these low\u2010energy particles to be\ntransported frommidnight to the duskside (eastwardly) due to\nslow electric field drift motion. At noon (Figures 4e and 4f),\nthe ring\u2010type phase space density becomes smaller and the\nlower\u2010energy component becomes stronger than on the\nduskside. The positive derivatives of the PSD f with respect\nto v? and vk just below the ring energy (the energy where f\npeaks), @f@v? > 0 and\n@f\n@vk\n> 0, suggest that the particle distribution\nis unstable. The anisotropic distribution of H+ with @f@\u0002 > 0, e.g.,\nPSD on the nightside, also provides the source of free energy\nfor L mode field\u2010aligned EMIC waves in the frequency band\nw < A\n\u00fe\nA\u00fe\u00fe1WH+ [Kennel and Petschek, 1966], where a is pitch\nangle, A+ is anisotropy for H+ species defined as a function\nof resonant velocity VR [Kennel and Petschek, 1966]:\nA\u00fe\u00f0VR\u00de \u00bc\nR1\n0 v?dv?\u00f0vk @f@v? \u0002 v?\n@f\n@vk\n\u00de v?vk\n2\nR1\n0 v?dv?f\n\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\nvk\u00bcVR\n\u00f01\u00de\n[10] A positive value of T?\/Tk \u2212 1 is an indicator of\npotential EMIC wave instability, but cannot itself yield the\nfrequency range where EMIC waves can grow. For parallel\npropagation, EMIC wave growth rate is dependent on the\nfractional number of resonant protons and the ion anisotropy\n(A+) at resonant energies [Kennel and Petschek, 1966], which\nare determined by wave frequency and the thermal plasma\nenvironment. Waves with frequency closer to the He+ gyro-\nfrequency WHe+ in the higher\u2010density thermal plasma region\n(e.g., inside the plume), can resonate with ring current protons\nat lower energy (\u223c1\u221210 keV).\n3. Ray Tracing Model\n[11] The PSD of ring current energetic ions and the plas-\nmaspheric electron density obtained from the RAM simula-\ntion are used to evaluate the path integrated gain of EMIC\nwaves in the He+ band between WO+ andWHe+ (Figure 1). The\nevaluation is preformed by the following three steps.\n[12] First, ray tracing is performed in order to obtain the\npropagation characteristics of the EMIC waves in the multi\u2010\nion (H+\u2212He+\u2212O+) magnetosphere. We use the HOTRAY\ncode [Horne, 1989] which has been extensively applied to\nelectromagnetic and electrostatic waves, including EMIC\nwaves in the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere [e.g.,Horne and Thorne,\n1993, 1994]. The code can trace any type of wave in a hot\nmagnetized plasma with weak growth or damping, provided\nthe wave remains linear. The ray tracing method assumes that\ngradients in the medium, notably the plasma density and\nmagnetic field gradients, are small compared to thewavelength,\nand that the gradients remain continuous. TheHOTRAY code\nchecks this condition at every step along the raypath. The ray\ntracing equations [Horne, 1989, equations (1) and (2)] are\nintegrated with respect to time to find the new position, and\nwave number at each time step. Although HOTRAY can also\nsolve the hot plasma dispersion relation to yield a complex\nwave vector k, whose imaginary part may be used to calculate\nthe path integrated gain, such analysis is limited to the cases\nwhere the distribution function of each component follows\nthe Ashour\u2010Abdalla and Kennel distribution [Ashour\u2010\nAbdalla and Kennel, 1978]. Although the PSD from the\nRAM can be fit by such bi\u2010Maxwellian type distributions in\nthe sector near midnight (Figures 4a and 4b), the simulated\nring current proton near the duskside cannot be fit by such a\ndistribution, because it consists of a higher\u2010energy compo-\nnent and a separate lower\u2010energy component, between which\nno significant PSD is present. Therefore, instead of using\nHOTRAY to calculate the growth rate, we introduce a new\nmethod to calculate the local growth rate (second step), which\ncan be applied for any type of distribution function.\n[13] For the purpose of ray tracing, a dipole magnetic field\nis assumed and a smooth density model is constructed from\nthe equatorial density simulation (the Rasmussen model) by\nthe RAM code. The density simulation has grids of every\n0.25 in L and every half hour in MLT. This discrete density\nmodel at each MLT is interpolated to obtain a smooth radial\nplasmaspheric electron density distribution in the meridian\nplane through cubic spline interpolation. Constant density\nalong the magnetic field lines is assumed, which is not a\ncritical assumption since the source of EMIC wave excitation\nis confined to within about 10\u00b0 latitude of the equator and the\nsubsequent propagation and reflection at high latitude [e.g.,\nThorne and Horne, 1992, 1994,Horne and Thorne, 1997] are\nnot treated in this paper. Since the fractional thermal ion\ncomposition greatly affects propagation characteristics of\nEMICwaves and is not explicitly simulated in the Rasmussen\nmodel, a typical storm time thermal ion composition, hH+ =\n77%, hHe+ = 20%, hO+ = 3%, is assumed, following Jordanova\net al. [2008]. The temperature of thermal electrons is set to\n10 eV and that of all ions is set to 1 eV [Chen et al., 2009].\n[14] For simplicity, we only perform two\u2010dimensional ray\ntracing in the meridian plane at various MLT, ignoring the\nazimuthal propagation, which is justified by the almost field\naligned wave group velocity of EMIC waves in the He+ band\nover the frequency range, wcr < w < WHe+ [e.g., Horne and\nThorne, 1993], where wcr is the crossover frequency\nbetween the O+ and He+ gyrofrequencies and WHe+ is the\nHe+ gyrofrequency.\n[15] Secondly, the ring current ion PSD obtained from the\nRAM simulations is used to evaluate the growth rate of EMIC\nwaves at each location along the raypath, following a cor-\nrected version of equation (3.9) in the work ofKennel [1966]:\n\u0003s \u00bc 2\u00042\n!2ps\n!jkkj\n@D\u00f00\u00de\n@!\nZ 1\n0\nv?dv?\nZ \u00fe1\n\u00021\ndvk\nX\nm\n\u0005\u00f0vk \u0002 !\u0002 mWskk\n\u00de\n\u0003\n\u0003\nG1s\n\u0004\n\u00f0P \u0002 n2 sin2 \u0006\u00de\u00052\u00f0L\u0002 n2\u00dev?J 2m\u00fe1 \u00fe 2v?\u00f0R\u0002 n2\u00deJ 2m\u00021\n\u00fe n2 sin2 \u0006v?\u00f0Jm\u00fe1 \u0002 Jm\u00021\u00de2\n\u0006\n\u0002 n2 cos \u0006 sin \u0006\u00052vkJm\u00f0Jm\u00fe1\u00f0R\u0002 n2\u00de \u00fe Jm\u00021\u00f0L\u0002 n2\u00de\u00de\n\u00fe n2 cos \u0006 sin \u0006v?\u00f0Jm\u00fe1 \u0002 Jm\u00021\u00de2\n\u0006\u0007\n\u00fe G2s\n\u0004\n4vkJm\n\u0005\u00f0L\u0002 n2\u00de\u00f0R\u0002 n2\u00de \u00fe n2 sin2 \u0006\u00f0S \u0002 n2\u00de\u0006\n\u0002 2n2 cos \u0006 sin \u0006\u0005\u00f0R\u0002 n2\u00dev?Jm\u00021 \u00fe \u00f0L\u0002 n2\u00dev?Jm\u00fe1\u0006\n\u0007\b\n\u00f02\u00de\nCHEN ET AL.: GLOBAL SIMULATION OF EMIC WAVES A07209A07209\n6 of 13\nwhere the subscript s denotes hot species (ring current H+,\nHe+ or O+ in our case) and the subscript m harmonic reso-\nnance, gs is temporal growth rate due to the contribution of\nhot species s, D(0) is the determinant of cold plasma disper-\nsion relation matrix defined in equation (3.5) of Kennel\n[1966], R, L, P and S are Stix coefficients, based on the\ncold component of plasma, \u0006, w and n are wave normal angle,\nfrequency and wave refractive index, respectively, Jm are\nBessel functions of order m with argument k?v?Ws , Ws = qsB\/ms.\nG1s and G2s involves gradients in the PSD, defined as,\nG1s \u00bc @Fs\n@v?\n\u0002 kk\n!\nvk\n@Fs\n@v?\n\u0002 v? @Fs\n@vk\n\u0004 \u0007\n\u00f03\u00de\nand\nG2s \u00bc Jm @Fs\n@vk\n\u00fe mWs\n!v?\nvk\n@Fs\n@v?\n\u0002 v? @Fs\n@vk\n\u0004 \u0007\u0003 \b\n; \u00f04\u00de\nwhere Fs is the normalized distribution function of species s.\nIt should be noted that there is a typo in the original paper, i.e.,\nR and L in the fifth line of equation (3.9) of Kennel [1966]\nshould be L and R, respectively. This formulation is strictly\nvalid only when the temporal growth is much smaller than\nthe wave frequency, g \u0004 w, which can readily be checked.\nIn the regime of small growth rate, the total growth is the sum\nof the temporal growth rate over all resonant species. The\nrange of resonance harmonicsm is set from \u221210 to 10 in our\ncalculation.\n[16] Thirdly, path\u2010integrated gain is calculated by inte-\ngrating the local growth rate along raypath:\nGain; dB \u00bc 20 log10\u00f0exp\u00f0\nZ\n\u0003dt\u00de\u00de: \u00f05\u00de\n[17] Figure 5 shows examples of the propagation char-\nacteristics and net gain of the waves launched at t = 48 h, L =\n4.5 and MLT = 19 with parallel propagation vector at the\nequator along the eastward edge of the plume, where a steep\nnegative density gradient exists in the radial direction. As a\nresult of the competition of wave refraction due to magnetic\ngradients and the negative density gradient, the wave vector is\nconfined to small angles with respect to the ambient magnetic\nfield, which enhances the net wave gain.Waves near 3.05WO+\nlaunched at this location can obtain wave gain up to 50 dB\nalong the raypath on one side of the equator, due to wave\nguidance and resonance with a large portion of H+ ions of\nlarge and positive A+. Waves with frequency \u223c3.65 WO+\n(closer to the He+ gyrofrequency) can resonate with a larger\nportion of H+ ions with lower vk, but the wave normal angle\nrapidly becomes oblique (\u226560\u00b0). During the oblique prop-\nagation, wave growth stops and the net wave gain is only\n2 dB. The wave normal angle of low\u2010frequency (2.25 WO+)\nwaves also remains small within 10 degrees in latitude.\nHowever, such waves do not resonate with a significant\nportion of particles (Ekres > 25 keV), thus only obtaining\nwave gain of about 20 dB. Both electron and proton\ncyclotron resonant energies minimize at the equator for\nexcited waves with the largest normalized wave frequency\nand zero wave normal angle. For most of the depicted\nwaves, strong growth occurs in the region within a few\ndegrees of the equator.\n4. Global Distribution of Wave Gain\n[18] The ray tracing illustrated in Figure 5 has been\nrepeated multiple times, in each case varying one of initial\nparameters to obtain the global distribution of wave gain.\nCalculations are performed in step of 0.25 L for 3.75 < L < 5.5,\nevery hour inMLT, every 0.1 inw\/WO+ forwcr <w < 3WO+ and\nevery 0.05 for 3 WO+ < w < 3.9 WO+, for conditions during\nthe main phase (t = 40 h) and recovery phase (t = 48 h) of\nthe storm. The maximum integrated wave gain is evaluated\nalong each raypath as a function of initial parameters, i.e., L,\nMLT, w\/WO+, and t.\n[19] As noted earlier, EMIC waves in this frequency range\nbasically propagate along the field line, which allows us to\nassociate the maximum path\u2010integrated gain with the wave\nlaunching location. The wave gain obtained in such way is\nonly one half of the net EMIC gain in the system, since we\nhave only considered propagation on one side of the equator.\nThe waves should obtain identical wave gain at the equator\nwith zero wave normal angle if waves are traced backward\nalong the half raypath from the location of maximum wave\ngain toward the equator [e.g., Chen et al., 2009]. Conse-\nquently, themaximumwave gainwould double if waves were\nlaunched from one side of the equator and propagate toward\nthe other side. The full EMIC wave gain is shown in Figure 6\n(t = 40 h) and Figure 7 (t = 48 h) as a function of normalized\nwave frequency w\/WO+ (y axis) and MLT (x axis) for different\nL shell, represented by each row. The quantity log10(Ne) as a\nfunction of MLT at different L, where Ne is in unit of cm\n\u22123, is\nsuperimposed in white lines. At t = 40 h, the preferential\nlocation for EMIC wave excitation is on duskside 4 < L < 5,\nincluding the region at the eastward edge of the plume and the\nregion inside the plume. This is in agreement with previous\nstorm simulations with the RAM [e.g., Jordanova et al.,\n2001, 2007]. Waves inside the plume experience gain\nabove 30 dB in the frequency range centered at about w =\n3 WO+. However, the strongest wave gain (>60 dB) occurs at\nthe eastward edge of the plume at slightly higher normalized\nfrequencies. Because of high thermal electron density in\nthose two regions, EMIC waves can resonate with a larger\nportion of ring current protons. Wave refraction due to\ndensity gradient on the edge of the plume counteracts against\nrefraction due to magnetic field gradient (which tends to pull\nthe wave vector away from the Earth), and thus waves are\nconfined to small wave normal angles for a significant por-\ntion of raypath, enhancing the wave gain.\n[20] On the westward edge of the plume, the wave gain is\nsmaller than on the eastward edge for the following two\nreasons. First, the density gradient on the west edge is not as\nsteep as on the east edge, because of the smoothing effect of\nplasmaspheric refilling on the dayside, which is simulated\nin the plasmaspheric model. Consequently, wave guidance\non the western edge is not as effective as on the eastern side.\nSecondly, the number of energetic protons (\u223c10 to 100 keV)\nresonating with EMIC waves is larger on the eastward side.\nThose energetic protons injected from the nightside follow\nwestward magnetic gradient and curvature drift. During the\nwestward drifting, ions are subject to gradual loss predom-\nCHEN ET AL.: GLOBAL SIMULATION OF EMIC WAVES A07209A07209\n7 of 13\ninately by the charge exchange process. This process also\nenhances their anisotropy, since those protons with small\npitch angle and thus mirroring at low altitudes are prefer-\nentially removed. On the westward edge, the decrease in\ngrowth rate caused by higher resonant energies (leading to\nfewer energetic resonant protons) dominates over the increase\nin growth rate due to the anisotropy enhancement. No sig-\nnificant wave gain occurs on the dayside, even in the region\n3 < L < 5, and 7 < MLT < 13 with large T?\/Tk. This is\nbecause of the lower thermal plasma density, which in-\ncreases the resonant ion energies and reduces the number of\nresonant protons. There is also no substantial wave gain on\nthe nightside inside the plasmasphere L \u22483, where T?\/Tk \u22121\nis large (\u22482), due to the reduced ring current ion phase space\ndensity caused by limited access and strong charge exchange\nloss at such low L.\n[21] At t = 48 h, the wave gain is also enhanced inside the\nplume and the strongest wave gain occurs at the eastward\nedge of the plume. Furthermore, the wave excitation region\nextends to just inside the plasmapause on the nightside\n(second panel in Figure 7) because of three special condi-\ntions: the proton anisotropy is enhanced (>1), the total ring\ncurrent proton density remains high (>6 cm\u22123), and wave\nguidance due to the plasmapause density gradient maintains\nsmall wave normal angle. The wave gain at t = 48 h is\ngenerally larger than that at t = 40 h, especially at the eastward\nedge of the plume, due to the increase in proton PSD\nand anisotropy at this location during the recovery phase\n(Figures 2d and 3d and Figures 4c and 4d). As the plume\nnarrows, the region of significant gain (>40 dB) also nar-\nrows. He+ band waves with frequency below 2 WO+ or above\n3.75 WO+ cannot be excited (gain less than a few dB) at any\nlocation (L, MLT). The lack of low\u2010frequency waves is due\nto the lower flux of resonant H+ at the larger resonant\nvelocities, while the lack of high\u2010frequency waves is due to\nthe rapid evolution toward highly oblique wave normal\nangle, and strong cyclotron damping by the thermal He+\nspecies at frequencies very close to the He+ gyrofrequency.\nNote that the anisotropy and total number density of ring\ncurrent protons on the dayside is mostly contributed by the\nlow\u2010energy portion of PSD (<5 keV, Figures 4e and 4f), with\nwhich only waves with frequency very close to WHe+ can\nFigure 5.

Therefore, no significant wave\ngain occurs on the dayside during the main phase and even\nduring the recovery phase when the ring current proton\ndensity increases and T?\/Tk remains high. The ratio of tem-\nporal growth rate to the wave frequency g\/w has been\nchecked and found to be less than 3\u20134% for all location and at\nall frequencies of interest, which validates calculation of\nwave gain obtained from equations (2) and (5).\n[22] EMIC waves are also able to resonate with relativistic\nelectrons. To evaluate the minimum electron resonant\nenergy capable of interacting with EMIC waves, we first\ntake the simulated distribution of EMIC wave gain near the\nequator, which is one half wave gain shown in Figures 6 and 7.\n30 dB is chosen as the critical gain, above which the waves\nare considered to have grown sufficiently to scatter resonant\nelectrons. The region where EMIC wave gain at the equator\nexceeds this critical gain is shown by the colored area in the\nFigures 8a and 8b for t = 40 and 48 h, respectively. The region\nof such EMIC waves excitation is confined to the eastward\nedge of the plume and extends to midnight just inside the\nplasmapause in the storm recovery. The minimum resonant\nenergy of electrons interacting with excited EMIC waves\nis also evaluated and color\u2010coded in Figure 8. During the\nmain phase (t = 40 h), the minimum resonant energy is above\n4.5 MeV, but it is reduced to about 3 MeV during the storm\nrecovery (t = 48 h). These scattering events occur preferen-\ntially at the eastward edge of the plume and just inside the\nplasmapause on the nightside.\n5. Summary and Discussion\n[23] A global model of EMIC wave excitation, based on\nthe RCM, RAM and HOTRAY codes, has been developed\nand applied to the 21 April 2001 storm. The RCM links\nsolar wind conditions to the injection of plasma sheet par-\nticles and supplies the ring current ion energy spectrum at\nr = 6.6 RE. The energy spectrum, together with an empirical\nmodel for ring current ion composition and anisotropy, is\nused to derive the MLT and time\u2010dependent boundary con-\ndition for the RAM code. The RCM code also provides a\nself\u2010consistent electric field, which can drive both the con-\nvective transport of ring current particles in the inner mag-\nnetosphere and the dynamical changes in the plasmaspheric\nmodel in the RAM simulation. The RAM code follows the\nevolution of the ring current ion PSD in energy and pitch\nangle. During the enhanced convection the injected ring\ncurrent ions develop a distribution function far from bi\u2010\nMaxwellian, primarily because of the energy\u2010dependent\ntransport associated with the combined electric field drift and\nmagnetic gradient drift. In agreement with previous RAM\nstudies, the simulated ion PSD is shown to be unstable to\nEMIC wave excitation, especially in the plume region where\nthe thermal plasma density is high and a ring\u2010type energetic\nion distribution develops. A new technique is used to eval-\nuate the global distribution of EMIC waves in the He+ band\nin the present study. Ray tracing is performed for EMIC\nwaves in the He+ band at various locations based on simu-\nlated plasmaspheric density from the RAM model, and path\u2010\nintegrated gain is calculated with a combination of ray\ntracing and evaluation of local temporal growth. The local\ngrowth rate is derived from the PSD of ring current ions from\nRAM simulation using equation (2), which is applicable for\narbitrary PSD. This allows us to evaluate the global distri-\nbution of EMIC excitation and the spectral properties of\nthese waves. The principal conclusions of this initial simu-\nlation are as follows:\n[24] 1. EMIC waves in the He+ band are preferentially\nexcited by the anisotropic ring current H+ distribution inside\nthe storm time plume, particularly at the eastward edge\nof the plume, and just inside the plasmapause in the sector\nfrom dusk to midnight. The wave gain during the recovery\nphase is more intense than during the main phase, however,\nwe note that wave\u2010particle interactions were not included in\nthe present RAM simulation. Pitch angle scattering by EMIC\nwaves will reduce the anisotropy of ring current protons and\nfurther reduce the wave growth [e.g., Jordanova et al., 2001,\n2007].\n[25] 2. The wave spectrum inside the plume extends from\nabove 2 WO+ to 3.5 WO+. The wave excited at the eastward\nedge of the plume and just inside the plasmapause can occur\nat wave frequencies up to 3.7WO+. The simulated ring current\nFigure 8. The region of EMIC wave excitation (with equatorial gain >30 dB) in the He+ band is shown\nby the colored area for (a) t = 40 h and (b) t = 48 h. Color coding represents the minimum resonant energy\nof electron interacting with the excited EMIC waves. The equatorial density is also shown in gray scale on\nthe background.\nCHEN ET AL.: GLOBAL SIMULATION OF EMIC WAVES A07209A07209\n11 of 13\nprotons also provide wave growth for EMIC waves with\nfrequencies above >3.7 WO+, but these waves are suppressed\nat all the locations because such waves quickly become\nhighly oblique and are also strongly damped by cyclotron\nabsorption of thermal He+.\n[26] Excited EMIC waves are able to resonate with elec-\ntrons as low as 3 MeV at the east edge of the plume and just\ninside the plasmapause in the premidnight sector during the\nrecovery phase of the April 2001 storm. Minimum electron\ncyclotron resonant energy during the main phase is found to\nbe above 4.5 MeV at the edge of the plume.\n[27] The global distribution of EMIC wave gain presented\nabove is generally consistent with the observations of the\nMLT distribution of waves obtained from previous obser-\nvational studies [e.g., Erlandson and Ukhorskiy, 2001,\nMeredith et al., 2003] and with scattering of protons in\ndetached subauroral proton arcs, which has been linked to the\nlocation of plumes [Spasojevi\u0107 et al., 2004]. However, there\nare several improvements, which we plan to incorporate, to\nmake the simulation more realistic in future modeling. The\nfirst is to include the effect of quasi\u2010linear relaxation on the\nevolving ion distributions in the spatial regions where EMIC\ninstability is predicted. The ring\u2010type ion distribution, which\ndevelops during transport and loss, should also be unstable\nto the excitation of equatorial magnetosonic waves [e.g.,\nBoardsen et al., 1992,Horne et al., 2000] and the quasi\u2010linear\nscattering by such waves will also need to be incorporated\ninto the evolving ion distribution. A recent study [Chen et al.,\n2009] has shown that wave gain can be enhanced and\nthe minimum resonant electron energy can be reduced by\nthe presence of density fluctuations inside the plume. This\nstructure is not included in the present simulation, but we\nintend to simulate this in the future by artificially adding\nelectric field fluctuations to the RCM\u2010simulated electric field.\nFinally, O+ is an important component of ring current ions,\nwhich needs to be included in the evaluation of net wave\namplification. Energetic O+ ions (\u2248 a few to tens keV) can\ncontribute to damp EMIC waves over all frequencies in the\nHe+ band [Kozyra et al., 1984, Jordanova et al., 1997]. The\neffect of damping due to O+ species should be evaluated,\nbased on improved RAM simulation with a more realistic ion\ncomposition at the RAM outer boundary.\n[28] The simulation of the global distribution of plasma\nwaves during storm time condition can also be applied for\nEMIC waves in other frequency range, e.g., in the O+ band\n(w < WO+) and in the H\n+ band (WHe+ < w < WH+). In a related\nstudy, a similar approach has been used to obtain the global\ndistribution of chorus waves, using the ring current electron\nPSD from RAM simulation [Jordanova et al., 2010].\nUnderstanding the global excitation of these two important\nmagnetospheric emissions, and their variability during storm\nconditions, is a necessary prerequisite for modeling the\nglobal dynamic evolution of radiation belt electrons and ring\ncurrent ions during storms.\n[29] Acknowledgments.
