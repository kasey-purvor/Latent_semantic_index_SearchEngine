The central issue is one of the correct determination of sensor height(s) above \nthe ground surface (terrain clearance) to the appropriate accuracy. The present study \nuses the radar and laser systems installed on a fixed-wing AEM system to further \ninvestigate the effect. The canopy effect can arise due to a variety of elevated features \nbelow, and in the vicinity of, the flight line. The most obvious features are well-\ndefined forest and copse zones together with domestic, commercial and agricultural \nbuildings. Such features may cause the terrain clearance to be underestimated and this \nhas the potential to introduce resistive artefacts and incorrect interface depths into \nconductivity models. Correct determination of terrain clearance is also important for \nthe accurate processing of the other geophysical data sets acquired by airborne \nsurveys. Radar and laser altimetry offer two very different physical measurements of \nheight above ground. Airborne radars detect the range to the nearest reflecting object. \nThey do this over a cone of influence that may have a radius (at the ground surface) of \n~55 m (assuming a survey height of 60 m). Reflections from objects that are off-line \nare thus a distinct possibility. In direct contrast, a laser ranging device with low beam \ndivergence provides a highly focussed measurement. Laser accuracies (typically < \n2cm) are far greater than those of radars (typically ~0.5 m). In addition, the rapid \nsampling of laser ranging devices (e.g. up to 2 kHz) allows both real-time and post-\n3 \n \nprocessing algorithms to be applied to estimate the maximum range recorded across \nappropriate time\/spatial windows. In our case a 2 kHz (maximum) dual-pulse laser \nwhen sampled at 200 Hz provides a x50 oversampling in relation to the 4 Hz \nsampling of the EM components. Our studies from recent surveys indicate that the \nradar altimeter often provides significantly underestimated values of terrain clearance. \nSuch estimates may be in error by up to 10 or 15 m across dense woodland. The \nissues of accuracy and reliability raised by the routine application of laser altimetry to \nAEM surveys and conductivity models are evaluated.  It is demonstrated that it is now \npossible to obtain reliable laser estimates of true height above ground surface across: \n(a) most forms of canopy encountered, (b) built structures of limited spatial scale and \n(c) bodies of water. \n \n \n \n4 \n \nIntroduction \n \nAirborne electromagnetic (AEM) surveying can employ frequency-domain or time-\ndomain techniques. The frequency-domain systems, considered here, currently exist \nas towed-bird configurations comprising coil sets within a rigid sensor boom towed \nbeneath a helicopter (HEM systems) and as fixed-wing (wing-tip sensor) mounted \ncoil sets. The frequencies employed by the two systems are similar with the HEM \nconfigurations capable of recording to a higher frequency, in excess of 100 kHz. \nTransmitter-receiver separations are typically 8 to 9 m in modern HEM sensor birds \nwhile fixed-wing system separations can exceed 21 m. These differences lead to \npotential differences in operational heights in terms of maintaining adequate \nsignal\/characteristics. A comparison of typical HEM and fixed-wing responses \n(coupling ratios) was presented by Beamish (2003). The provision of adequate \nsignal\/noise at survey sensor elevations above 50 m is a critical factor when flying \nregulations preclude surveying at lower flight altitudes. Broadly, in terms of general \nAEM surveying behaviour, we can anticipate coil sensor elevations in the range 30 to \n60 m, although exceptions are inevitable. \n \nAltitude estimation in airborne systems may utilise a variety of sensors and \nprocedures. These include differential or multi-receiver GPS (required as part of \nsurvey navigation and accurate survey data location). Radar and laser altimeter \nsystems are the primary sensors used to determine the height of the sensors above \nground surface. Multi-parameter geophysical systems may also include on-board \nbarometric altimeters (recording height above mean sea level) and are typically used \nfor STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure) airborne radiometric calculations. \n5 \n \nAccuracies and behaviours of these systems are considered later. The main focus of \ninterest for the purpose of this study are the radar and laser altimeters used to \ndetermine sensor (i.e. the transmitter and receiver coil pairs) height above ground \nsurface. The parameter is highly significant in the estimation of conductivity data and \nmodels derived from the observed coil-coil coupling ratios. A study using only radar \naltitude information was presented by Beamish (2002a). \n \nForward modelling of AEM responses allows the prediction of signal\/noise \nperformance of specific AEM systems and coil configurations. It is also possible to \npredict the accuracy required of the measurement of height above ground. Both \nmeasurement accuracies are related to the predicted, measured or assumed noise level \nof the coupling ratios. In general the highest frequency of each system determines the \nhighest accuracy that should be achieved. In addition, the altitude accuracy \nrequirement is more stringent for surveys performed over conductive environments \nand at low altitude. The sensitivity of coupling ratios to altitude is system specific and \nthe investigations performed in this study are based on the AEM-05 fixed wing (Twin \nOtter) frequency-domain system and associated measurement systems described by \nLev\u00e4niemi et al. (2009).  The system incorporates 4 dual vertical coplanar coils \nmounted on the wingtips and provides a bandwidth from 900 Hz to 25 kHz. \n \nA simple comparison of typical radar and laser systems used in AEM surveys reveals \nthe following. The typical and stated accuracy of a modern laser system is a few \ncentimetres while that of a typical radar may be or the order of 0.5 m.  \nThis is demonstrated in Figure 1 which shows well-calibrated radar (Ralt) and laser \n(Lalt) altimeter data, sampled at 4 Hz, obtained across a 1 km section of a lake. The \n6 \n \nsurvey aircraft undergoes a 4 m altitude undulation over the 1 km profile however the \nstated accuracies of the two devices appear to be observed. A second difference in the \ntwo types of altitude measurement lies in their physical beamwidths. A radar system, \noperating pulse modulation at a frequency of ~4.3 GHz, may have a beamwidth \ndefined by an angle of up to 68\u00b0. The system will measure the distance to the nearest \nreflecting object within a spatial scale defined by a 3D cone of influence as indicated \nschematically in Figure 2. Reflections from objects that are off-line are a distinct \npossibility, particularly as survey elevation increases. In direct contrast, a modern \nlaser system data is capable of very rapid sampling with a very low beam dispersion \n(typically 1 to 2 mrad). At normal AEM survey altitudes, a laser system should \nprovide a zone of influence that is approximately a vertical tube <15 cm in diameter at \nthe ground surface. This is indicated schematically in Figure 2. A final difference that \nstems from their physical beamwidths, is their differing abilities to provide accurate \nmeasurements of height above ground surface in the presence of elevated features. \nFeatures such as forest and copse zones together with domestic, commercial and \nagricultural buildings may cause either of the two systems to record an \nunderestimated ground clearance and this is generally called the canopy effect (e.g. \nFraser, 1978; Beamish, 2002a). As is demonstrated here, a conventional laser \naltimeter system in the presence of light canopy can provide penetration to the ground \nsurface. Recent laser systems deployed on fixed-wing platforms and in EM birds have \nused a dual-pulse laser altimeter (Ahl and Winkler, 2006; Lev\u00e4niemi et al., 2009). The \nAEM-05 system incorporated a Riegl dual pulse (meaning that it can differentiate the \ntimes of the first and last pulse it receives) laser in 2005. The device has a maximum \npulse sampling rate of 2 kHz. The device is programmable so that for longer \nmeasurement times, single laser shots are averaged. The device then returns amplitude \n7 \n \nand quality factors of the reflection characteristics. The rapid sampling of laser \nranging devices allows both real-time and post-processing algorithms to be applied to \nestimate the maximum range recorded across appropriate time\/spatial windows. It is \nthis extended ability that allows for an increased accuracy and uniformly reliable \nmeasurement of height above ground surface for all AEM surveys. \n \n \n \nAltitude estimation in airborne systems \n \nAlthough different airborne systems employ different altitude estimation \nconfigurations, a common set of modern survey navigation\/altitude sensors includes \none or more multi-channel differential GPS systems providing x, y, z  location.  In \nthese systems the vertical (z) measurement provides height above a reference geoid \n(e.g. WGS-84). Radar and laser altimeters are used to measure height above ground \nsurface and a barometric sensor to measure height above mean sea level. \n \nThe accuracy of the GPS vertical measurement is linked to the overall accuracy of the \nGPS installation and the processing that is carried out to reduce the error terms \ninherent in GPS location measurements. These are discussed in relation to the \nestimation of digital elevation models derived from airborne geophysical survey data \nby Richardson (2000) and Hauteneimi et al. (2005). Currently differential GPS \ninvolving an-board GPS receiver operated with a base station receiver, located in the \nsurvey area, is a common operational format. In broad terms the vertical GPS-z \nmeasurement is inherently less accurate than the GPS-x,y measurement. \n8 \n \n \nDifferential GPS reduces the effects of these errors and provides improved accuracy \nto the order of several metres. Note that calculated horizontal positions are more \naccurate than associated ellipsoidal heights because of the influence of satellite \ngeometry on vertical positions. Some of the errors listed above influence the vertical \ncomponent much more than the horizontal component. A rule of thumb is that the \nellipsoidal height accuracy is 1.5 times worse than the horizontal accuracy (Natural \nResources Canada, 1995).  \n \n \nThe differential GPS system operated as part of the AEM-05 system is well described \nby Hautaniemi et al. (2005). The system employs single frequency (L1) \nGPS+GLONASS constellations although the GLONASS network is now not fully \noperational. To improve the observed GPS+GLONASS data, a differential correction, \nusing base station data, is applied to the observed coordinate data. In the differential \ncorrection, errors caused by ionospheric and tropospheric refraction, ephemeris and \nlock errors are significantly reduced. Coordinate transformation from WGS84 to local \nplanar coordinate system is also undertaken. It is estimated that with single frequency \nGPS+GLONASS receivers in differential mode, and using appropriate commercial \nGPS software tools, we can measure the GPS-z reference height to a typical accuracy \nof about 1.5 metres (Hauteneimi et al., 2005). \n \nRadar and laser altimeter systems are discussed in more detail later. A typical radar \nsystem may have an accuracy of about 0.6 m (at 30 m elevation) increasing to ~1 m at \nelevations above 50 m. A modern laser system is far more accurate and a typical \n9 \n \naccuracy is a few (e.g. 2 to 3) centimetres. On-board barometric altimeters (recording \nheight above mean sea level), are typically used for STP (Standard Temperature and \nPressure) airborne radiometric calculations. To increase reliability and accuracy for \nheight estimation (e.g. for EM applications) they require simultaneous base station or \nradio-link control tower information to accommodate inherent atmospheric weather \nvariations. Evaluations of the accuracies of these systems have been undertaken by \nAviation Authorities (e.g. the Federal Aviation Authority) using simulation models. \nTypically, sustained accuracies of better than several metres cannot be expected. \n \nIn broad terms the two main, sub-metre measurements of sensor elevation above \nground currently available are those provided by radar and laser systems. It is \nacknowledged that this situation may change as multi-frequency, multi-receiver GPS \nand real-time kinematic networks and procedures continue to evolve. Despite the \ntheoretical accuracies described above, the two main measurements are known to \nsuffer from high inaccuracies (>50%) when attempting to record height above ground \nlevel across dense canopy and elevated structures. The abilities of these systems to \nprovide accurate and reliable sensor elevations for airborne EM applications is the \nmain issue investigated in this paper. \n \nCanopy effects, due to elevated features, result in underestimated radar and laser \naltimeter readings of height above ground. A second class of effect, termed the \npaddock effect, has been noted by Richardson (2000) and is further described by \nBrodie and Lane (2003). The paddock (meaning a ploughed portion of land) effect, as \ncurrently defined, results in overestimated radar altimeter readings only.  It is \nsuggested that a possible reason for the observed paddock effect is that surface \n10 \n \nroughness of the same order as the wavelength of the radar (=7 cm for a 4.3 GHz \nradar) influences the shape and timing of the radar reflections. A reduction in \namplitude, or a shift in the timing, appears to result in an overestimated estimate of \ntime-travel and hence altitude. Richardson (2000) and Brodie and Lane (2003) \nprovide examples in which the radar altitude is overestimated by 3 to 5 m in these \ncircumstances.  \n \nThe inter-calibration of radar and laser altitude estimates is best performed, or \nverified, over bodies of still water such as lakes. When such estimates are compared \non an individual survey basis, a typical pattern emerges as shown in Figure 3. The \nradar (Ralt) and laser (Lalt) elevation estimates shown come from a small detailed \nsurvey (1700 line-km) that employed a line-spacing of 75 m.  The survey area in \nsouthern Finland is predominantly rural (fields, forests and lakes). The procedure used \nto obtain the laser estimates (the Lmax algorithm) is described later. The data, \nsampled at 4 Hz, comprise ~150,000 points and the nominal survey elevation is 30 m. \nThe distinct bias to significantly positive values of the difference Lalt - Ralt is \nevident. Some 79% of the altitude estimates provide values with Lalt minus Ralt  \ngreater than, or equal to, zero. The smaller amount of apparently overestimated Ralt \nestimates (i.e. Lalt < Ralt) are largely confined to an amplitude range of < 4 m. A \ndetailed investigation was carried out in relation to possible associations between \nareas of cultivated land (as defined on maps) and the occurrence of the condition \nLalt<Ralt. No persistent associations, that would have supported the paddock effect, \nwere found.   \n \n \n11 \n \nAltitude dependence of AEM coupling ratios \n \nThe sensitivity of coupling ratios to altitude is system specific. Here we consider only \nthe AEM-05 system. The behaviour of coupling ratios with altitude is an important \nelement in determining the accuracy required in the associated estimate of altitude. \nThe highest frequency of each system determines the highest accuracy required. The \naltitude accuracy requirement is most stringent for surveys performed in conductive \nenvironments and at low altitude. \n \nAs an example, we consider the AEM-05 system and the highest frequency of 24,510 \nHz. Using a survey altitude of 30 m we calculate the response for a series of half \nspace conductivities for sensor elevations that may be underestimated by up to 10 cm \n(i.e. an elevation range from 29.90 to 30 m). The response used is the modulus of the \ncomplex (real and imaginary) coupling ratios. The results for a resistive half space \n(1000 ohm.m) and a moderately conducting half space (10 ohm.m) are shown in \nFigure 4. The coupling ratios for an altitude of 30 m are 2258 ppm (1000 ohm.m) and \n23,984 ppm (10 ohm.m) and the results are shown normalised to these reference \nresponse values. \n \nThe results obtained for the 1000 ohm.m half-space are clearly insensitive to errors in \naltitude. The variation over the 10 cm range is less than 10 ppm which is within the \ntypical noise envelope of acquired survey data. This implies that a 10 cm altitude \ndifference ascribed to the altitude would not unduly influence the models obtained \nacross entirely resistive terrains. In the more conductive 10 ohm.m environment, \nresponse differences extend to 186 ppm indicating that a 10 cm error in altitude at a \n12 \n \nnominal survey elevation of 30 m, would be significant (well above typical acquired \nnoise figures at this frequency). If we were to adopt a precise noise level of, say 60 \nppm, then the required accuracy of the altitude estimate is predicted to be ~3 cm. This \nis clearly beyond the accuracy available from typical radar systems and can only be \nachieved with a laser ranging device. In practice, since the sensor is moving at ~15 m \nper second, the centimetre accuracy would only be truly meaningful in the case of a \nperfectly flat surface. The influence of altitude error decreases with decreasing \nfrequency. The equivalent response at a lower frequency of 3005 Hz is also shown in \nFigure 4. \n \nAs an indication of the differential effects of altitude with frequency it can be noted \nthat, for the 10 ohm.m half space model and an elevation of 56 m, an elevation \ndifference of 10 cm produces response differences of only 24 ppm. Since AEM \nsurveys may be conducted at a variety of nominal elevations, it is the lowest elevation \nthat determines the required accuracy of the height above ground measurement. \n \n \nWhen interpreting data from a multi-frequency system, the different sensitivities of \nthe coupling ratios at each frequency produce a different error at each frequency if an \nerror in the altitude assignment occurs. The errors in coupling ratios due to an \nincorrectly assigned altitude increase with both conductivity and frequency. Thus if a \nconductivity model is determined from multi-frequency data with an underestimated \naltitude, the model is progressively biased (to a progressively more resistive estimate) \nwith increasing frequency. This has the net result of providing overestimated \n13 \n \nresistivities in the upper sections of the model. The effect on two forms of \nconductivity model is now described. \n \n \nInfluence of altitude errors on 1D conductivity models \n \nIt should first be noted that the standard single frequency Fraser half-space \ntransformation (Fraser, 1978), when applied using both in phase and quadrature \ncoupling ratios, is effective in returning resistivity estimates unbiased by errors in the \naltitude estimate (Beard, 2000). Beamish (2002b) suggested the Fraser pseudo-layer \nprocedure resulted in conservative estimates of conductivity when compared to \nestimates obtained by equivalent iterative, minimisation procedures. \n \nIn order to distinguish vertical resistivity variations and obtain a formal measure of \nmodel validity one can use a multi-layer 1-D inversion (Beard, 2000; Constable et al., \n1987; Fitterman and Deszcz-Pan, 1998; Paterson and Redford, 1986; Sengpiel and \nSiemon, 1998). The models returned by such inversions are non-unique because they \ntypically solve an underdetermined problem. They therefore employ additional \nconstraints to stabilise the problem, such as the Marquardt-Levenberg regularisation \nor smoothness constraints. Smoothness constraints can be applied in the vertical or \nhorizontal (lateral) directions. \n \nMulti-layer iterative minimisation inversion methods can be used to provide both \nuniform half space models (Beamish, 2002b) and models containing few or many \nlayers (T\u00f8lb\u00f8ll and Christensen, 2006). Here we consider how altitude errors \n14 \n \ninfluence both few and many layer models when altitude is assumed to be known (and \naccurate) in an inversion procedure. \n \nThe synthetic model comprises 2 conductive layers (100 mS\/m) in a resistive (1 \nmS\/m) host. The first conductive layer has a thickness of 5 m and is located between \ndepths of 10 and 15 m. The second conductive layer has a thickness of 20 m and is \nlocated between depths of 60 and 80 m. The model has five layers including the \nunderlying half space. The model is used to calculate synthetic responses for the \nAEM-05 system at a fixed elevation. In this study, an elevation of 50 m is used. \nIncremental errors to the correct altitude are then introduced to allow an assessment of \nthe model distortions introduced by using an incorrect altitude. \n \nThe altitude-error effect on a few layer model assessment is considered first. The \ninversion method used is the constrained conjugate gradient inversion described by \nTartaras and Beamish (2006). Although developed for the application of lateral \nconstraints to model calculations, the method is inherently stable and does not require \nregularisation even when lateral constraints are not used. In the case of the discrete \naltitude-error behaviour, lateral constraints were not employed. \n \nWhen dealing with survey data, the actual (or most appropriate) number of layers \nmust be evaluated. In the case of the synthetic data, the number of layers is known \nprecisely. The synthetic model was used to generate the 4 frequency fixed-wing \nresponse assuming a survey elevation of 50 m. Gaussian random errors at the 2.5% \nlevel were then added to the data. A series of altitude errors of between -15 m (i.e. \nunderestimated elevations) and +5 m (i.e. overestimated values) were then introduced \n15 \n \nto the data in 1 m increments. The results of inverting the data set are summarised in \nFigure 5. The model obtained using the correct altitude (50 m) is arrowed. All models \nacross the range of altitude errors detect the 2 conductive layers within the resistive \nhost. In broad terms the thickness of the upper conductor is approximately correct but \nthe conductivity is underestimated. The latter result is connected with the limited \nthickness of the conductor rather than any error in altitude. The conductivity of the \nlower conductor is approximately correct but the thickness is persistently \noverestimated. The inversions return chi-square misfits (Constable et al., 1987) of 8 \nfor all the models when 2.5% errors are assigned. Since the expectation of the data \nmisfit is 8, all the models are equally well-fitted. In this case, a ch-square misfit of 8 \ncorresponds to an rms misfit of unity. \n \nThe effect of underestimated altitude errors on the few layer model is to artificially \nincrease the depth estimate of the two conductive layers (for this model). A reciprocal \nsituation occurs when altitude is overestimated and the depth to both conductive \nlayers is underestimated. If we consider that altitude may be underestimated by 15 m, \nthen the depth of near surface conductive features may be overestimated by ~ 15 m \nand the depth to deeper conductive features may be overestimated by more than 20 m. \n \nThe corresponding behaviour in the case of many layer inversion models is now \nconsidered. An Occam (Constable et al., 1987) multi-layer procedure offering \nregularised, smooth models in the vertical direction is used (e.g. Farquharson et al., \n2003). The advantage of the procedure is that there is no requirement to set the \nnumber of conductivity interfaces (layers) within the model. The models produced \nhowever cannot detect interfaces; neither can they recover \u2018true\u2019 layer conductivity \n16 \n \nvalues. The inversion model is essentially a smooth representation of the most likely \n1D conductivity distribution. The inversion starting model used a uniform half space \ndivided into 35 layers above a half space.  For the synthetic model data, a standard \nerror of 2.5% was assumed. \n \nThe results of inverting the data set are summarised in Figure 6. The model obtained \nusing the correct altitude (50 m) is arrowed. All models across the range of altitude \nerrors detect the 2 conductive layers within the resistive host as 2 local maxima in the \nconductivity profile. In the vicinity of the correct altitude, both conductivities are \nclearly underestimated. The depth to the near surface conductor displays a similar \npattern to that observed in the few layer case. As the error in the underestimated \naltitude increases, the Occam minimisation attempts to fit the incorrect data (incorrect \nby virtue of the altitude assigned) by introducing more extreme (oscillatory) model \nbehaviour. Again, the inversions return chi-square misfits of 8 for all the models when \n2.5% errors are assigned. \n \nMany of the published formal AEM inversion strategies do not appear to require the \nuse of an equivalent pseudolayer (a fixed high resistivity at-surface layer of variable \nthickness) to accommodate errors in altitude. It is theoretically possible to include \nsensor altitude as an unknown parameter in an inversion strategy (e.g. Hodges, 2003). \nThis has the general net effect of increasing the number of unknowns thereby \nincreasing the parameter resolution issues within an already underdetermined \nproblem. An alternative procedure in few layer inversion strategies was proposed by \nBeamish (2002b) and reiterated by T\u00f8lb\u00f8ll and Christensen (2006). The air-layer \ntechnique introduces a high resistivity (equivalent to air) upper layer to represent \n17 \n \nsensor altitude above ground surface. The layer thickness is free to vary but the \nresistivity (e.g. 100,000 ohm.m) is highly constrained or fixed. The air-layer \ntechnique is more difficult to implement within a many layer, regularised inversion \nprocedure since the first or second vertical derivative of the conductivity profile is \nconstrained to be a smooth function.  \n \nGiven the difficulties arising in the case of providing an accurate and reliable estimate \nof sensor height above ground, it would be preferable to investigate the degree to \nwhich the estimate can be improved. As already stated, it is likely that only laser \naltimetry can provide the centimetre accuracy required. The behaviour of both radar \nand laser systems is now investigated. \n \n \nRadar and Laser altimeter systems \n \nThere are, of course, a variety of radar and laser altimeter systems employed in AEM \nsystems. A typical and common radar installation manufactured by Honeywell\/Sperry \nor by Collins operates at a frequency of around 4.3GHz (short pulse modulation). The \naccuracy of these devices is usually quoted as being the greater of two quantities i.e. \nan absolute figure of about 0.6 m or 2% of the elevation (at low survey altitudes). \nThere is a general indication that even with spatial filtering of oversampled data, an \naccuracy level of better than 1 m may not be achieved with radar altimeters (Brodie \nand Lane, 2003). A second important parameter in radar altimeters is the beamwidth. \nNormally this is defined as the angle between two directions in a plane containing the \nmaximum of the beam (i.e. the vertical plane in this case) in which the radiation \n18 \n \nintensity is half the maximum value of the beam or -3 dB. The radar altimeter \neffectively measures the distance to the nearest reflecting object within its beamwidth. \nA typical beamwidth figure appropriate to Honeywell\/Sperry and Collins radar \nsystems is 50 degrees, although mean estimates may vary between values of 45 and \n68 degrees.  \n  \nModern laser altimeter systems of the type employed in AEM systems (e.g. \nmanufactured by Optech and Riegl) have a typical pulse repetition rate of up 2 kHz. \nLaser systems deployed in bird systems appear to sample the laser data at the fastest \ngeophysical channel rate e.g. 10 Hz. Specifications of such systems indicate that the \nlaser altimeter measures the distance from the EM bird to the ground, except in areas \nof dense tree cover. The disturbances to laser EM bird altimeter data caused by trees \nand buildings are noted by T\u00f8lb\u00f8ll and Christensen (2006) and Siemon (2009). \n \nMore recent laser systems deployed on EM birds have used a dual-pulse laser \naltimeter (Lev\u00e4niemi et al., 2009, Ahl and Winkler, 2006). The AEM-05 system, \nconsidered here, incorporated a Riegl dual pulse (meaning first and last pulse) laser in \n2005. The device has a maximum pulse sampling rate of 2 kHz. The device is \nprogrammable so that for longer measurement times, single laser shots are averaged. \nThe device then returns amplitude and quality factors of the reflection characteristics. \nA last target detection capability of multiple (or obscured) targets is also provided. In \ntheory, the control provided should allow the laser to be \u2018tuned\u2019 for routine \nmeasurement of distance to the ground surface through obscuring reflectors such as \nvegetation and canopy (although not through solid structures such as buildings). The \n19 \n \nprocedures applied to the processing of such laser data are now described and a \ndetailed case study is presented. \n \nThe Lmax algorithm \n \nIn practice, by operating the laser at 200 Hz, an oversampling of x50 is achieved in \nrelation to the standard 4 Hz sampling of the EM components. The averaging is useful \nfor accurate detection of badly reflecting targets or for targets with changing \nreflection characteristics during measurement (e.g. a water surface). At a typical \nflying speed of 60 m\/s, the raw 2 kHz sampling equates to a shot every 3 cm. \nAveraging over 10 points to provide a 200 Hz estimate equates to a distance of 30 cm.  \n \nThe laser altimeter data are recorded as a separate data stream at 200 Hz. \nThe 50 point redundancy in the sampling then allows a post-processing algorithm, \nbased on independent windows of 50 samples, to obtain an accurate (although \nnecessarily spatially-averaged) estimate of height above ground surface for the EM \ndata channels (i.e. resampled to 4 Hz). The simplest procedure is to determine the \nmaximum value of the laser data across the 50-point data window. This procedure is \nreferred to here as an Lmax estimate. In most cases this provides an effective measure \nof true height above ground surface through vegetation and most types of canopy we \nhave encountered. In extreme cases of high reflectance (sun on water), all individual \ndata point may be null returns and, in this case, the final estimate is a zero value. \n \nIt should also be noted that the stated accuracy of measurement of such systems is 2.5 \ncm and this should be readily achieved when averaging raw 2 kHz data across \n20 \n \nreduced time intervals such as 200 Hz. In addition the most important feature of the \nlaser measurement is that it is a beam with a limited amount of divergence. The stated \nbeam divergence figures for the AEM-05 device indicate that the beam diameter on \nthe ground will be less than 15 cm for most survey flight elevations. \n \nThe behaviour of the 200 Hz laser data in relation to its resampled form and the radar \ndata is best illustrated using a detailed example above a building. The use of a well-\ndefined structure, rather than canopy, provides a more robust example with clean edge \neffects. Figure 7a shows a downward-looking image from the AEM-05 video system \nabove a single structure within an industrial estate in the UK. Survey altitude above \nground is about 66 m and the building is about 40 m wide (edges A and B) and 5 m \nhigh. The flat roof of the building has a series of 4 ventilation structures, each about 1 \nm high. The flight path traverses the centre of the image as shown by the dash line. \n \nFigure 7b shows the 200 Hz raw and 4 Hz resampled Lmax laser data, together with \nthe radar altitude recorded across the structure. The total elevation range shown is 11 \nm.  The 200 Hz laser data defines reflections from the main edges of the building (A \nand B) together with the ventilation structures. The general decreasing trend in \nelevation is due to a small (< 2 m) aircraft descent along this portion of the flight line. \nThe variation is recorded by the GPS-z (height above geoid) data shown (a value of \n73 m was subtracted to contain the data within the scale of the graph). Across the \ncentral structure, both radar and the 200 Hz laser data provide underestimated values \nof height above ground level. The less accurate behaviour of the radar altimeter (i.e. it \nis perturbed by two structures) can also be noted. On the open ground to the north of \n21 \n \nthe structure, radar and laser data return correct height above ground some 20 m from \nthe northern edge of the building. \n \nThe Lmax 4 Hz laser data is shown by the line with open square symbols. Two 50-\npoint data windows centred on estimation points 1 and 2 are indicated. Using the \nsimple Lmax algorithm these points would have been underestimated due to width of \nthis large structure. Most structures encountered at low survey elevations are, in fact, \nsingle structures such as rural houses and farms. The simple Lmax algorithm is able to \nobtain accurate height above ground across the majority of these structures of limited \nspatial extent. Since the perimeters of many conurbations in the UK now contain \nindustrial units of similar scale to that used in this example, a revised Lmax algorithm \nhas also been evaluated here. In this case, an expanding window technique (e.g. using \nsuccessive expansions of 50, 100, 200 data points), allows the adjacent spatial \nconsistency of different estimates to be compared. Clearly many aspects of the basic \nLmax algorithm can be developed to suite different circumstances and requirements. \n \nThe extent to which laser systems are capable of providing accurate and reliable \nestimates of height above ground surface for AEM applications are now considered in \na case study. \n \n \nSurvey case study \n \nThe case study example considers a portion of single survey line acquired across the \nedge of a lake, then across a dense canopy and then across a single isolated building. \n22 \n \nThe features are included within a profile length of some 660 m. Selected flight video \nimages (Figure 8) show a lake in sunlight (labelled A), a central deciduous wooded \narea (labelled B) and an isolated building (labelled C). Figure 9 then shows a \ncomparison of radar altitude (RALT, 4 Hz) and laser altitude (200 Hz, raw and 4 Hz, \nLmax resampled) over a time interval of 11 seconds. Assuming a survey speed of 60 \nm\/s, the corresponding distance is 660 m.  \n \nOver the lake (A), the 200 Hz laser data suffers a series of zero amplitude (null) \nreturns that are classed as zero altitude. The radar altitude returns are stable across \nwhat is assumed to be a flat body of water. Across the wooded area (B), the 200 Hz \nlaser data show a complex sequence of returns (altitudes between 46 and 68 m) that \nmay be interpreted as true height above ground surface (e.g. largest altitudes, full \npenetration through the canopy,) and the height of the upper canopy (smallest \naltitudes). Between these 2 limits, we assume partial penetration of the canopy occurs. \nThe radar, with a much lower (averaging) spatial resolution, shows a characteristic \nsmooth decrease from the woodland edges (less dense foliage) through to the centre \nof the woodland (foliage most dense, and taller trees).  The laser clearly identifies the \nisolated building (C), a sports pavilion, together with the slope of its pitched roof.  \n \nThe resampled 4 Hz laser for the example is shown in Figure 9 by the blue trace.  \nOver the body of water we obtain correspondence between the radar and laser \nestimates. Across the forested area, a realistic upper bound to the raw 200 Hz laser \ndata is obtained. This upper trace follows the same trend observed in the GPS height \nabove geoid (shown as the uppermost trace). The depression observed in the radar \naltitude across zone B is interpreted as reflecting the height of the canopy. The results \n23 \n \nindicate that errors in the radar estimate of height above ground extend to 11 m, in \nthis example. \n \nThe effect of the underestimated radar altitude on conductivity models for these data \nhas been investigated by comparing the results obtained using Ralt and Lmax as the \nknown altitude parameter in an inversion procedure. Here we consider the two cases \nof few and many layer inversion procedures, as previously described. The many layer \nOccam procedure is considered initially as it provides an indication of the most \nappropriate number of layers for use in subsequent few layer inversions. As in the \nprevious synthetic data study the inversion starting model used a uniform half space \ndivided into 35 layers above a half space.  A simple and uniform standard error of 5% \nwas assumed as the error model for the data. \n \nThe conductivity models obtained are compared in Figure 10a (Ralt) and 10b (Lmax). \nThe lateral extent of the central canopy effect as defined by the Lmax and Ralt \naltitude differences is indicated by arrows. The zone of maximum canopy effect (~12 \nm) is indicated by the shaded rectangles. Both models reveal 2 conductive layers, the \nfirst a shallow thin zone followed by a deeper, more conductive and thicker zone. The \ngeological context is a Quaternary sequence with the higher conductivities being \nascribed to clay content. The perturbation to the model obtained using Ralt (Figure \n10a) is similar to that observed in the synthetic model study. In the case of the survey \ndata, the canopy effect is progressive and leads to a depression in both shallow and \ndeeper conductive zones. A further effect is to produce a highly resistive zone (<0.5 \nmS\/m, as indicated) in the at- and near-surface zone of maximum height of canopy. \n24 \n \nAssuming a 5% error model, the chi-square misfits range from the expectation level \nof 8 to a maximum of 13 (Ralt) and 14 (Lalt).  \n \nThe smooth Occam models essentially map gradients in the vertical conductivity \nprofiles. As can be seen in Figure 10, there are large apparent variations in the \nlocation of the maxima in conductivity, particularly in the deeper conductive zone, \nacross the profile. A few layer inversion with lateral constraints can also be applied to \nthe data, to reduce the point-to-point variability in the conductivity models and to \nbetter demonstrate the canopy effect.  The inversion method used is the constrained \nconjugate gradient inversion described by Tartaras and Beamish (2006). Following \nthe previous Occam analysis, a 5 layer model configuration was assumed appropriate. \nThe conductivity models obtained are compared in Figure 11a (using Ralt) and \nFigure11b (using Lmax). The canopy parameters are again indicated by arrows and \nthe grey rectangles. In the laterally-constrained few layer models, the canopy effect is \nmuch clearer. In the Ralt inversion (Figure 11a) the perturbation in the depth to the \ntop of each conductor follows the general behaviour of Ralt observed in Figure 9. The \nthickness of each layer remains uniform across the profile however the behaviour \nobserved is linked to the fact that the starting model used is matched to that \ndetermined by the preceding Occam analysis. Again, the chi-square misfits are found \nto be within 2 standard deviations of the expectation values for both sets of inversion \nresults. The inversions thus appear to be fitting both data sets equally well. \n \n \nLaser altimeter behaviour across bodies of water \n \n25 \n \nOne of the aspects concerning the reliability of laser altitude measurements is their \nability to provide valid measurements across bodies of water undergoing a high light \nreflectance due to the presence and angle of the sun. The water bodies may be inland \nlakes, rivers, estuaries or the sea. The previous survey case study provided a small \nexample of the behaviour observed. The high reflectance condition may also occur \nover snow\/ice covered land or sea. The degree to which this condition is encountered \nis obviously survey specific. For each survey undertaken it is possible to investigate \nthe Lmax data set for zero\/null returns (i.e. no reflections detected across a 3 m spatial \nwindow). When such analyses are carried out in conjunction with topographic maps it \nis possible to establish the locations of the zero returns. Using the flight-path video \nimages it is also possible to establish the qualitative reflectance characteristics at the \nlocations of the zero returns. Examination of large quantities of our survey data \nreveals that the almost exclusive majority of zero returns are indeed connected with \nwater bodies and the presence, strength and angle of the sun. It should be noted that \nsome surveys over areas containing lakes have produced no zero returns and this is \nsimply related to the prevailing weather. Low sun angles (e.g. early morning) can \nproduce localised zones of zero returns. Figure 12 is an example, taken from part of a \ndetailed survey area in southern Finland. The rectangle shown on a topographic \nbackground map was surveyed using N-S flight lines with a separation of 75 m. \nThe symbols are posted at locations along each flight line which provide null returns \nusing the standard Lmax algorithm. The background topographic map identifies the \nlocations of all the null laser returns with lakes (shown in blue). In this example, the \nnull sequences along each flight line do not involve large numbers of estimates and an \ninterpolation through each sequence might be considered appropriate. \n \n26 \n \nHigh angle, strong sun reflections over extensive water bodies can provide spatially \nextensive null returns in laser altimeter data. In these cases it is necessary to assume \nthat the water body is flat and that the Ralt measurement can provide an adequate \nmeasurement of height above the water surface. The method adopted in such \ncircumstances is simply to replace the laser height estimate (a null) with that obtained \nby the radar altimeter. \n \n \n \n \nSummary and conclusions \n \nThe accurate and reliable estimation of height above ground (sensor elevation) \ncontributes to the successful determination of conductivity models from AEM data \nsets. Both radar and laser altimeters are currently in routine use in modern AEM \nsystems. The accuracy in sensor elevation required by a given AEM system is \ndetermined by the highest frequency employed and the associated noise level of the \nEM response at that frequency. Required sensor elevation accuracies increase at lower \nflight elevations and with increasing conductivity. Most modern AEM systems \nrequire the centimetre accuracy only available with laser ranging devices. \n \nThe canopy effect has the potential to provide significant (up to ~50%) errors in the \nmeasurement of sensor elevation when AEM surveys are conducted at low altitude.  \nWhen canopy\/structures are encountered, the differences in beamwidths of the two \ndevices can provide different estimates of sensor elevation. When an underestimated \n27 \n \naltitude is used to derive a few or many layer conductivity model from multi-\nfrequency data, the net effect is to introduce near-surface resistive artefacts into the \nmodel.  Depths to deeper conductive zones may also be significantly overestimated. \nExamples of the behaviour of conductivity models due to incorrect altitude \nassignments have been provided here for both synthetic and survey data. Further \ndiscussions of the modelling and interpretation complexity introduced by the \nunreliability of sensor elevation estimates can be found in T\u00f8lb\u00f8ll and Christensen \n(2006) and Siemon et al. (2009). \n \nGiven the spatial complexity and persistence of canopy\/structure effects in AEM data \nsets, it is worth developing a more rigorous approach to the accurate and reliable \nestimation of sensor elevation. It has been demonstrated that modern laser ranging \ndevices are capable of accurate (~ 2 cm) and rapid (e.g. up to 2 kHz) sampling. These \ncharacteristics allow both real-time and post-processing algorithms to be developed. \nThe simplest procedure, here referred to as the Lmax algorithm, is to estimate the \nmaximum range recorded across appropriate time\/spatial windows. These subset \nestimates are found to provide reliable estimates of height above ground surface at \nspatial scales of the order of a few tens of centimetres.  \n \nThe main benefit of such measurements and procedures is in relation to sensor \nelevation estimation in AEM surveys across zones of canopy and elevated structures. \nThese are prevalent, for instance, in all surveys conducted in the UK. As the case \nstudy examples presented here demonstrate, it is now possible to obtain reliable laser \nestimates of sensor elevation across: (a) most forms of canopy (including vegetation) \nencountered, (b) built structures of limited spatial scale and (c) bodies of water. In \n28 \n \ncases where the sun angle on large bodies of water produces extensive null laser \nreturns, it is necessary to replace laser estimates with those from the radar altimeter. \n \nThe laser measurement has a low beamwidth dispersion. This makes it amenable to  \nsimple correction for aircraft\/bird orientation effects. Fitterman and Yin (2004) \ndiscuss the many aspects of bird manoeuvre distortion on frequency-domain \nhelicopter-borne responses. Devices, such as GPS gyroscopes, that measure pitch, \nheading and roll are now common and the cosine correction of angles formed by pitch \nand roll allows a straightforward correction of the laser estimation of height above \nground. \n \nFinally it is worth noting that, following the technical discussions of radar and laser \naltimeters, the estimate of radar height is essentially a form of Digital Terrain Model \n(a DTM, i.e. it contains the effects of vegetation and elevated structures). When \nprocessed (e.g. the Lmax algorithm) laser altimeter data is also available, the height \nestimate conforms to that of a Digital Surface Model (a DSM, i.e. a bare-earth model \ndevoid of surface effects). In certain cases these data sets may be available at much \nhigher resolution than that obtained by an AEM survey. Where they are not available, \nthe joint availability provides a potentially useful additional topographic mapping \nservice. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \n29 \n \nThis report is published with the permission of the Executive Director, British \nGeological Survey (NERC) and the Programme Manager of the Geological Survey of \nFinland (GTK). \n \n \n \n \n \n \nReferences \n \nAhl A. and Winkler, E. 2006.
