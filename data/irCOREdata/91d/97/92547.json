Industrialisation and urbanisation led to \ngreater legislative control of their lives: in relation to work, education, health, and \ncare. Measures to improve their lot were not motivated just by philanthropy but by \nconcerns about the threat they posed to society as delinquents and vagrants and how \nthey would fulfil their future roles as adults, workers and soldiers (Aries, 1962; \nParton, 1987).   \n \nChanging images of childhood led to their being increasingly seen as having rights \u2013 \nto survival, protection and development (Archard, 1993; Hodgson, 1999).  However, a \ncommon theme in all this early legislation was that children were seen as passive \nrecipients, to be \u2018seen but not heard\u2019. There was no thought that their opinions and \nwishes might be worth knowing.  They did not participate in decision making about \ntheir own fate.  The right to participation is a more recent development that is still \nonly at the early stages of being implemented.  It is asserted in Article 12 of the 1989 \nUN Convention on the Rights of the Child: \n1. State parties shall assure to the child who is capable of forming his or \nher own views the right to express these views freely in all matters \naffecting the child, the views of the child being given due weight in \naccordance with the age and maturity of the child. \n \n2. For this purpose, the child shall in particular be provided opportunity \nto be heard in any judicial and administrative proceedings affecting the \nchild, either directly, or through a representative or an appropriate \nbody, in a manner consistent with the procedural rules of national law. \n \nIn England, this right is enshrined in the Children Act 1989.   In hearing children\u2019s \ncases, courts not only have to make the child\u2019s welfare paramount but also must have \n 3\nregard to \u2018the ascertainable wishes and feelings of the child concerned (considered in \nthe light of his age and understanding)\u2019. Children looked after by a local authority \nhave similar rights to have their views ascertained and taken into consideration when \ndecisions about them are being made.  \n \nThe study reported in this article was commissioned by a local authority wanting to \nmake some initial investigations of the views of children in their care.  It was \nconsidered that children might be inhibited if approached by staff from the local \nauthority itself so an independent researcher was employed.  The findings of this \nstudy are reported before discussing the problems of responding constructively to the \nchildren\u2019s criticisms and wishes.  The sample size is small so no claims are made to \nrepresentativeness.   Related research on children will be cited where relevant but, \nlike this research, studies have mainly been qualitative and so give little indication of \nthe prevalence of the opinions reported.  However, whether these children are \nidiosyncratic or representative, their views matter and, in considering how we can \nacknowledge them, they raise questions about the impact of recent changes in child \ncare social work on children.  In particular, the rise of managerialism and a \nconsequent decrease in professionalism seems to limit the power of social workers to \nrespond to children\u2019s individual preferences.  The Department of Health\u2019s well \nintentioned efforts to improve the quality of care for looked after children may, \nparadoxically, be creating obstacles to their empowerment. \n \n \nMethodology \n \n 4\nThe study aimed to ascertain from children their views on being looked after and the \ndegree of power they felt they had to influence decisions made about them.  \n \nA total of fifteen looked after children were interviewed.  Social workers were asked \nto identify children who met the criteria of being aged between ten and seventeen and \nhaving been in care for at least two years (so that they had substantial experience of \nbeing looked after).  The children were given a letter from the researcher explaining \nthe purpose of the study and asking if they were willing to be interviewed.  If they \nsaid yes, then their details were passed to the researcher to make direct contact with \nthem. It was stressed that anything they said would be confidential and would not be \nreported in any way that allowed them to be identified.  The researcher did not have \naccess to their records and relied only on their own reports, so that their opinions are \npresented free from any influence from professional perceptions and interpretations of \ntheir lives. \n \nThis method of finding a sample clearly carries the risk of some bias in the way that \nsocial workers chose which children to approach.  They might, for instance, have \nselected children whom they felt would not be too critical of Social Services, or those \nwho would be most articulate.   The method was chosen, however, because \nconfidentiality prevented the researcher being given names and addresses without the \nchildren\u2019s permission.  It is not clear how many children were approached and refused \nthough evidence from the team managers suggests that this was very low.  Of those \nwho initially said they would participate, two dropped out when it came to arranging \nan interview, leaving a total sample of fifteen.  This comprised: \nGender: Girls:  7  Boys: 8 \n 5\nAge: \n10 years 1 \n14 years 4 \n15 years 4 \n16 years 3 \n17 years 3 \n \nLength of time in care (based on children\u2019s account): \n2 years 3 \n3 years 3 \n4 years 3 \n5 years 3 \n7 years 1 \n13 years 2 \n \nEthnicity:  (there was considerable variation in the degree of detail the children chose \nto give about their ethnicity so the data is in very basic categories): \n  Black 7 \n  White 8 \n \nType of care: only two were in residential care, the remainder in foster care. \n \nChildren were given a general overview of the aim of the research but the interviews \nwere then conducted in a mainly unstructured way.  They were told that the researcher \nwanted to hear their views on how much they are told about what is happening to \n 6\nthem, whether they feel their point of view is listened to, and whether they feel they \nare involved in decisions made about their lives. Some issues were covered by all \ninterviewees, in some instances because they spontaneously arose and in some \nbecause the researcher introduced them.  Unstructured interviews have the \ndisadvantage that they do not all deal with the same topics so their contents cannot be \nso easily collated (Robson, 1993, p.229).  However, they carry the advantage of \nallowing the child, rather than researcher, to decide what issues are important to a \nlooked after child and therefore give a more vivid picture of the world as they \nexperience it.   \n \nThe unstructured approach was also chosen for ethical reasons. Research involving \nchildren creates particular moral dilemmas in that they are typically less powerful \nthan the adult researcher (Thomas and O\u2019Kane,1998).  In this instance, there are also \nreasons for concern about the nature of their consent to participate. Although they \nwere asked if they wanted to take part, the relative power positions of themselves and \ntheir social workers may well have led them to feel that they had little choice (the \napparently low refusal rate would support this). The unstructured interview was \nchosen in that it gave them maximum control over the research process and ensured \nthat each child talked only of those topics that mattered to them and could avoid \npersonal issues they did not want to discuss with a stranger. \n \nBrief notes were taken while interviewing the children and more detailed records \nmade immediately afterwards.   \n \n 7\nFindings \n \nBecause of the promise of confidentiality, care has been taken in reporting the \nfindings to ensure that no individual can be identified. \n \nThe importance of the social worker \n \nAll mentioned the importance of the social worker in their lives. The social worker \nwas seen as very powerful and, when the relationship worked well, as a very strong \nally.  They were able to list all the social workers they had had.  One described the \nqualities needed in a social worker as: \n \nSomeone who can talk to children, get to know them, take them out, \nand phone regularly so they keep in touch with what is happening. \n \nMost could remember at least one social worker with whom they had got on \nparticularly well and who had made them feel well cared for and supported. \n \n \u2018She would sort out anything that was bothering me\u2019. \n \nThe biggest complaint about social workers (from eight children) was the high \nturnover and the subsequent disruption for them.  They had all kept an exact tally of \nhow many they had had and some of the figures seemed unusually high, e.g. two \nreported having had six different social workers in the past two years.  One of these \nsaid he had not even been informed of one change and had discovered it by chance.   \n \n   \u2018It makes you feel neglected, when they keep changing\u2019. \n \n\u2018What\u2019s the point of getting to know your new social worker when she \nwill probably be gone soon?\u2019 \n \nSocial workers were also criticised for their reliability in everyday matters such as \nkeeping appointments on time or holding reviews on time.  Children interpreted this \n 8\ncarelessness as a sign of their low priority in the social worker\u2019s life.  One young \nperson, reporting on the failure to hold her reviews regularly, was very angry but also \nfelt helpless to alter matters.   \n \nComments on the quality of social work support are likely to be biased towards those \nwho had a complaint to make since those who had a more positive and unproblematic \nexperience were less likely to dwell on the issue in depth.  However, Butler and \nWilliamson\u2019s research bears out both the approving and critical opinions.  They report \nthat many children are seeking a \u2018more emotional, empathic level of interaction\u2019 but \nthat the experience for many is, in contrast, an \u2018almost technical, allegedly \u2018robotic\u2019 \nnature of professional interventions in children\u2019s lives\u2019(1994, p.84). \n \nIn relation to continuity, research and the Department of Health (1996) have \nhighlighted the importance of continuity of placement, rather than of social worker.  \nHowever, placement changes were only criticised strongly by one young person in \nthis study.  He had had a particularly turbulent career in care; he identified his worst \nperiod as one week end when he had had three different placements. The other \nchildren who talked of placement changes had some understanding of why they had \nbeen necessary and, in some cases, desirable.  They, therefore, seemed to feel the \nchange had been less imposed on them than changes of social worker. \n  \nParticipation in reviews \n \nThere was a range of views on the usefulness of reviews.  For some, particularly those \nin stable placements, they were unproblematic and fairly pleasant experiences - \nevidence of the good care being taken of them by the carers and social workers.  \n \n\u2018The reviews take place at home and my social worker talks to me \nbeforehand about what I want discussed and then introduces me to \neveryone\u2019. \n  \nFor others, however, they were occasions when they felt powerless and frustrated.  \nThere were complaints that any plans made were not implemented, that their wishes \nwere over-ruled with no explanation given, that their concerns were not addressed, or: \n 9\n \n\u2018They say they\u2019ll talk about it at the next review but they never do.\u2019 \n \nThree respondents made comments of the form that they were allowed to influence \ntrivial decisions about themselves but professionals would not let them get involved in \nthe big issues \u2013 the ones that really mattered to them, such as where they lived or how \noften they visited their birth mother. \n \nComplaints about reviews were much more common from older children who were \nwanting more autonomy and influence so, in many respects, they echo criticisms that \nmany teenagers might make of their birth families.  \n \nThe extent to which children actually participate in their reviews or understand what \nis going on has been questioned by other research (Stein and Ellis, 1983; Gardner, \n1985; Hodgson, 1988; Grimshaw and Sinclair, 1997; Shaw, 1998; Walker, 1999).  \nThey have little say in who is invited to the review and can be unclear about people\u2019s \nroles or the purpose of the review.  Only 57% of Shaw\u2019s sample of 2073 could state \nwith confidence that they had a care plan (Shaw, 1998, p.30).    Most report that the \npurpose of the meeting is to talk about, rather than to, them (Walker, 1999). \n \nContact with birth family \n \nA major source of conflict with social workers was the amount of contact allowed \nwith the birth family, particularly with the mother.  Most of the children raised the \nsubject.  Two reported having stable and satisfactory contact but the rest were \ndissatisfied with both the amount of contact and their involvement in deciding how \nmuch contact there should be.  One girl was worried that her mother, who had \ndepression, might commit suicide if she was not allowed sufficient contact.  At the \nsame time, she was scared that the social worker might end contact altogether \nalthough she could give no clear reason why this might happen.  The issue was clearly \ncausing her considerable distress.  \n \nAnother young person was mystified as to why he was only allowed to phone his \nmother at set times though he would like to feel she was in reach at any time.    \n 10\n \nLooked after children\u2019s desire to see more of their birth families was also reported in \nShaw\u2019s study where only 51% of her sample were seeing their family as much as they \nwould like.  For children aged 8-11, the figure was even lower at 37% (Shaw, 1998, \np.31). \n \nIt was clear from their discussions that their birth mother was still a vivid and central \ncharacter in their lives even when, as in two cases, she was mainly a source of \ndistress.  For the rest, comments about the birth mother indicated many positive \naspects to the relationship mixed with an awareness of her difficulties or \nshortcomings.  For instance, one spoke of her mother being a heroin addict and \nshowed some compassion for her inability to give up. The importance of the birth \nmother seemed true regardless of the child\u2019s length of time in care, the reasons they \ngave for their admission to care, or their satisfaction with their placement.  \n \nA few were clearly very sensitive to the way their birth mothers were treated by \nprofessionals and concerned that she might feel uncomfortable and therefore be \ndeterred from attending reviews and staying involved in their lives.  \n \n\u2018She [his mother] used to feel uncomfortable at the reviews because \nthe social workers weren\u2019t nice to her so she stopped coming.\u2019 \n \n \nThe importance of an advocate \n \nDespite its being standard practice to remind all looked after children of the \ncomplaints system at each review, only one of the children said that she knew about \nthe complaints system.  She was reluctant to use it, despite having serious concerns, \nabout her care, because she believed it would take a long time and she needed action \nnow.  The rest were asked but denied having heard of it. This lack of knowledge \nsuggests that the information given to them at reviews is not fully understood.  Shaw \n(1998, p.68) reports that 33% of her sample did not know of the complaints \nprocedure, and suggests that it is perhaps too complex or formal a system to be easily \nunderstood by children. However, it may be that it seems irrelevant to them.  When \n 11\nasked what they would do if they wanted to complain, the children in this study said \nthey would approach an adult to act as an advocate for them.  All but one of the \nchildren could readily identify to whom they would turn to in that sort of situation.  \nMany went on to give examples of how they had been helped. The adult identified as \nan advocate ranged from a birth relative, e.g. an older sibling, to the foster carer, a \nteacher, or the social worker. The variety of people who were identified as being \nhelpful suggests that it is a personal matter and the person significant to the child may \nnot be the one the system would identify as their official supporter. \n \nThese findings are more positive than those of Butler and Williamson (1994) who \nreport a greater degree of loss of confidence in all professionals and reluctance to turn \nto them for help. \n \n \nConfidentiality \n \nOne major difference between corporate parenting and ordinary families is the \nnumber of people involved in a child\u2019s care.  It is essential to share information for \ngood planning and care but, from the child\u2019s point of view, this can seem very \nintrusive.  Again, the problem reflects the normal processes of growing up.  Teenagers \ndevelop autonomy and increasing privacy as part of maturation but, for a child in care, \nit is difficult to achieve that same sense of privacy.  Several of the older teenagers \ncomplained of the lack of confidentiality and, hence, a reluctance to share their \nthoughts and feelings because it would all get written down in their file and read by \nstrangers.  \n \n\u2018I felt really let down because I thought I had been talking to her \nprivately but I saw she had written it all down in the file for anyone to \nread. I wouldn\u2019t have said anything to her if I had known she was \ngoing to do that\u2019 \n  \nAnother described how embarrassed she had been when she realised that it was \nwidely known that she had started taking the contraceptive pill. \n \n 12\nOne teenager who was receiving counselling said that this was very helpful: \n \n\u2018She has told me what kinds of things she would pass on to my social \nworker so I know the rest of it will be kept secret.\u2019 \n \nAnother praised her psychiatrist for offering a secure and confidential relationship. \n \nThe Action and Assessment records, which some of the young people had started to \ncomplete, were singled out for criticism in asking so much personal information \nwhich the young people were unsure how it was going to be used and who would \nhave access to it. \n \nButler and Williamson\u2019s research also highlighted the importance and perceived lack \nof confidentiality to children: \u2018there is a pervasive feeling amongst children and \nyoung people that even a commitment to confidentiality is, too often, a \u2018false \npromise\u2019 and that information divulged will then be \u2018spread around\u2019 without the \nconsent of the individual concerned\u2019 (1994, p.78).  \n \nAnti-discriminatory practice: \n \nOnly one young person spoke explicitly of his experience of racism. He was a \nseventeen year old black man who complained that he was continually stopped and \nquestioned by the police and that white women looked fearful and crossed the road to \navoid him.  Since he had no record of crime or violence, he felt this was completely \nunfair and due to racism.  He seemed to have low self-esteem and his description of \nhis career in care conveyed the impression that he had felt that he was treated by \nprofessionals as a problem rather than a valuable person. \n \nOne young black man, living with an elder sibling, had been offered re-housing in a \nnotorious local estate with major racial, drug and crime problems.  His sister felt \nangry that the Social Services should consider placing them there where she would \nhave a much harder task in keeping him out of trouble. \n \n 13\nFor others, the issue of ethnicity was raised in relation to their desired contact with \ntheir birth family and the knowledge this gave them about their identity and their \nculture. Very few were of white English ethnicity.  \n \nThe Social Services had apparently made considerable effort to place children in same \nrace placements and, when this was commented on, it was always in an approving \nway. \n \nDiscussion  \n \nThis is only a small sample so the responses cannot be taken as representative of the \nviews of looked after children in general.  However, it is possible to examine the \nissues they raised and discuss the challenges they pose to professionals endeavouring \nto listen to their voices whether or not they are typical.  \n \nThe relationship between empowerment and development \n \n\u2018The evolving capacities of the child\u2019 is a basic principle of children\u2019s rights, \nendorsing the view that it is reasonable that children are informed and guided and \ngradually take over more responsibility in matters concerning them. For children in \nour society, becoming able to take responsibility for themselves is a crucial stage of \ndevelopment.  Therefore, for looked after children, helping to empower them is not \njust an ethical requirement but, equally, a developmental task.   \n \nThe criticisms the children in this study made about feeling little or no power have to \nbe seen in a developmental context.  From the age of around twelve, children develop \nan ability for more abstract thinking and hence more complex decision making \n(Flekkoy and Kaufman, 1997, p.122).   It is not surprising that most of the criticisms \ncame from teenagers while those aged 10-12 were much happier with their low level \nof empowerment.  \n \nAdolescence is not a major problem period for most teenagers (Rutter, 1990) but \nthose who are looked after are a particularly vulnerable group who need extra help to \naccomplish the developmental tasks effectively (Packman and Hall, 1995). Rutter\u2019s \n 14\n(1990) research emphasises the importance of empowerment: children with positive \nfeelings of self-esteem, mastery and control can more easily manage stressful \nexperiences. \n \nIt is difficult for parents who have known the child from birth to handle the process of \nempowerment, and even more difficult for social workers and carers to manage.  It \nrequires a close understanding of the child\u2019s level of development and involves a \nseries of micro decisions and small shifts of boundaries so that  children gradually test \nout their skills and increase their power.  \n \n It also requires the courage to take risks and let the child have more freedom and \nmake decisions that you might not necessarily agree with.  Making mistakes (if they \ndo indeed turn out to be mistakes) is an essential part of learning for most people and \na child who has been sheltered from the usual mishaps of teenage years is not well \nprepared for adult life.  However, in the current defensive atmosphere of social work, \nit must be hard for social workers to make risky decisions.  The temptation may often \nbe to play safe but this is an obstacle to handing over responsibility to teenagers.  \nBalancing the need to respect children\u2019s need for protection from decisions beyond \ntheir competence with their need to develop their decision making skills is a complex \ntask. \n \nThe complaints of the children in this study are corroborated by other research that \nhas shown that looked after children have less opportunity than average to participate \nin decisions or take risks (Page and Clark, 1977, Social Services Inspectorate, 1985, \nBerridge, 1985).  Social workers, mistakenly, seem to see acquisition of the necessary \nlife skills for autonomous living as something that could be compressed into the last \nfew months of a care career (Dept. of Health, 1996, p.19). \n \nShemmings\u2019 (2000) and Trinder\u2019s (1997) research both reveal a worrying tendency \nfor professionals to see children\u2019s development as a dichotomy rather than a \ncontinuum.  They are \u2018classified as either subjects or objects, competent or \nincompetent, reliable or unreliable, harmed by decision making or harmed by \nexclusion, wanting to participate or not wanting to participate (Trinder, 1997, p.301).  \nThis is at odds with the developmental perspective of a gradual acquisition of \n 15\ncompetence and perhaps explains the frustrations reported in this study of feeling \nexcluded.  It raises serious concerns about how major a change is needed for \nprofessionals to help children with the slow, maturational process of increasing power \nand autonomy. \n \n \nThe best interest of the child \n \nOne objection to the principle of rights for children is that children do not need them \nbecause adults, particularly parents, have their best interests at heart.  This optimistic \nbelief is expressed in the first draft of the Department of Health framework for the \nassessment of children in need: \u2018parents invariably want to do their best for their \nchildren\u2019 (1999, p.12).  However, history can show numerous, horrific examples of \nparents who have clearly not wanted to do their best for their children but have \nseriously abused them, or who have put their  own interests first and neglected the \nchild\u2019s needs.  Similarly, we cannot assume that all professionals are beyond criticism \nin their work with vulnerable children and will always act in their best interest.  \nIndeed, the system recognises this and incorporates many features designed to place \nchecks on professionals\u2019 actions. \n \nActing in the child\u2019s best interest is not just a question of good intention but also of \nknowledge: what is in the best interest of the child in a particular circumstance?  \n \nThe Department of Health has made considerable effort to improve social workers\u2019 \nknowledge of child development.  Yet this is far from sufficient to allow us to make \nconfident judgements about the long term effects of different options. Herbert  (1997, \np.88) points out the range of conflicting theories about development and the paucity \nof empirical evidence.  As Flekkoy and Kaufman contend:  \n \n 16\nIn spite of an increasing body of knowledge about child development, family \ndynamics and societal impacts on the family as well as the child, the effects of \nmuch of what is done for and to children is more or less guess-work\u2019 (1997, \np.46) \n \nWhen one considers the depressing evidence on outcomes for looked after children in \nadult life, humility about our ability to know what is in the child\u2019s best interest seems \nthe appropriate emotion. \n \nFor children living in their birth family, the norm is for them to take increasing power \nand responsibility in determining what is in their best interest as they mature.  Family \nstyles vary greatly and there is no standard pace at which this happens.  For the \nlooked after child, progression appears problematic.  To some degree, the Department \nof Health LAC system of documentation, with its emphasis on standardisation and \nspecified goals, reduces the space for children to contribute to determining what is in \ntheir best interest and what outcomes they themselves want to achieve.   \n \nIn this study, the issue of contact with the birth family was one that led to major \ndisputes with professionals about what was in the child\u2019s best interests.  For some of \nthe children, it may have been their own relatives rather than the professionals that \nwere limiting contact but, if so, this did not appear to have been shared with them.   \nFor many, it may be that increased contact would, as they believe, be beneficial.  \nBiehal et al\u2019s research (1995) found that the birth family remained very important to \nlooked after children and contact was valuable in helping children develop their \nidentity.  Contact was also very valuable at the point of leaving care where a low level \nof birth family contact was related to little or no support. The study found that \nsubstitute carers did not provide an alternative long term support system for the vast \nmajority of care leavers. \n \nIn limiting contact, professionals may well have good intentions and, perhaps,  be \naiming to protect the children from distress but, in parenting, the balance has to be \n 17\ncontinually re-negotiated between protecting a child and letting them learn to take \nrisky decisions and to think for themselves. \n \nConfidentiality \n \nThe criticisms of lack of confidentiality raise complex practice issues.  Sharing \ninformation about a looked after child is seen as essential for good assessment and \nplanning to meet their needs.  However, privacy is important and tends to become \nmore so as a child reaches adolescence. \n \nThe UN convention gives children a right to personal privacy:  \nArticle 16:  \n1. No child shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with \nhis or her privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful \nattacks on his or her honour or reputation. \n2. The child has the right to the protection of the law against such \ninterference or attacks. \n \nAs Flekkoy and Kaufman (1997, p.39) point out: \u2018the way in which privacy is defined \nand exercised will vary according to culture and situation\u2019.   \n \nInformation privacy is perhaps the key issue for looked after children. It has become \nparticularly acute because of the introduction of the LAC system of documentation.  \nThis is intended to improve the quality of care by encouraging better information \ngathering, assessment, planning and reviewing.  It could be argued that the most \nsensitive information, about the private world of the child, can only be obtained by \nasking the child and that, by answering, they have given permission for it to be known \nby others.  However, in reality, a looked after child may feel considerable pressure to \nanswer any questions posed by adult professionals, fearing that refusal to co-operate \nmay be interpreted in a negative way. \n \nThe conflict about confidentiality and good information gathering is acknowledged in \nthe planned Department of Health (2000) changes to the Action and Assessment \nRecords.  It is proposed to add the paragraph: \n 18\n \nSome of the information requested by this form is sensitive. Children and \nyoung people may be reluctant to share and record it if they are uncertain how \nit is to be used.  It is important to ensure that children and young people \nunderstand why this information is being asked for; they need to know that \nwhilst the intention is not to make copies of this form, there might be \noccasions where the local authority is requested to make the information \navailable to other professionals.  Although confidentiality will be respected as \nfar as possible, it cannot always be guaranteed. \n \nThis seems to fall far short of offering security to the child.  The grounds for breaking \nconfidentiality are expressed in such vague terms that it is hard to think of an occasion \nwhen they could not be used.  Moreover, there is no recognition that the child might \nhave sound reasons for disagreeing with what information is needed about them.  \nThere is a strong assumption that the professionals know best about what information \nis required to understand and help the child. \n \nResearch has shown the importance of a mentor to looked after children: \n \nUnqualified love may not be a realistic expectation for anyone other than a \nparent, but ensuring that the young person has an adult who listens to what \nthey say, is dependable and available, and prepared to support them no matter \nwhat they have done, should be a possibility  \u2026  To have an adult to confide \nin and discuss emotions and problems with is particularly important during \nadolescence because this is a period full of opportunity and risk (Dept. of \nHealth, 1996, p.26). \n \nThe need for such a confidante was eloquently expressed by children in this study but \nthey clearly linked \u2018confiding\u2019 to \u2018confidentiality\u2019 \u2013 to having an individual, not a \nteam, whom they could trust. \n \nWhether accurate or not, the views of children in this study and in Butler and \nWilliamson\u2019s are that there are very lax standards of confidentiality in the child care \nsystem.  Butler and Williamson report that children want absolute confidentiality and \nthat, if the professional wants to consult others for advice, this should either be done \nanonymously or with the child\u2019s permission (1994, p.91).  Professionals may feel that \nsome information has to be shared with others to protect the child\u2019s welfare.  \nHowever, this benefit has to be weighed against the cost of losing children\u2019s \nwillingness to confide because there is no guarantee of privacy.  \n 19\n \nThe quality of service to looked after children \n \nOne set of criticisms from the children can be grouped as complaints about the quality \nof the service they were receiving.  One striking feature of these is that the children \nwere stressing the importance, to them, of the quality of their relationships.  The high \nturnover of social work staff, for instance, was a problem in that it harmed their \nability to develop a good relationship.   \n \nResource issues are bound to place some constraints on the quality of service but, \nwithin a fixed budget, managers have to decide on priorities. The children\u2019s views on \nwhat matters to them might be one way of determining how the budget is spent.  \nHowever, current government policy, despite its advocacy of children\u2019s rights, is \nintroducing the Quality Protects Initiative which sets out the performance indicators \nby which local authorities will be assessed.  These, for the most part, focus on the \neasily measurable, quantitative aspects of service \u2013 the number of placement changes, \nfor example.  This is in contrast to the children\u2019s concerns with qualitative issues \nwhich are much harder to measure.  The quantitative measures are, of course, meant \nto be indirect markers of quality.  The number of placement changes is a rough \nindicator of whether the child has been offered the opportunity to form stable \nattachments. \n \nThe implications of the Quality Protects Initiative are two-fold.  They restrict local \nauthorities ability to determine priorities for resources for themselves and so limit \ntheir ability to respond to the views of children.  They also, by concentrating on \nquantitative measures, may change the nature of practice in ways contrary to the \nwishes of children \u2013 and probably of most practitioners.  For social workers with \nheavy caseloads, the pressure to meet the performance indicators by, for example, \ncompleting the LAC documentation, may reduce the time they are able to give to the \nmore intangible aspects of their job such as spending time with a looked after child \nand building up a good relationship. \n \nA review of research by the Department of Health suggests that social workers are, \nindeed, giving less priority to the relationship skills valued by children:  \n 20\n \nTo develop a relationship of trust and work on behavioural and emotional \nproblems, was once a major aim of much social work practice with teenagers.  \nHowever, the current studies suggest that priorities in social services \ndepartments have shifted and now focus more on providing immediate \nmaterial support at the expense of tackling fundamental needs (Dept. of \nHealth, 1996, p.26). \n \nOn this issue, the children in this study may have shown a better understanding of \nwhat is in their best interest that current policy makers. \n \nConclusion \n \nThe concept of children\u2019s rights, including their right to participation, is one that few \nprofessionals in child care would contest.  However, empowering looked after \nchildren to have a greater say in decisions made about them is a complex task.  It is \nnecessary not only to gradually increase the degree of power a child has but also to \nhelp them learn how to use that power responsibly.  It is as much an issue of parenting \nas ethics. \n \nThis study corroborates other studies in finding that children are able and willing to \narticulate their views on their role in decision making.  Although many of the \nresponses were critical of their experiences, none of the children seemed irrational or \neven unduly optimistic about what they wanted.  The areas of criticism, however, \nillustrate some of the difficulties that will be encountered if children are given a \ngreater say.   \n \nEssentially, adding another voice to the decision making process adds another \npotential dissident.  There are already a number of adults involved at the level of \ndirect contact with the child \u2013 birth family, professionals and carers.  Local authority \nmanagement and, increasingly, the Department of Health are also major shapers of the \noptions that can be discussed.  To empower a child to make their voice heard in this \ncontext is a daunting task, more complicated than that facing the child growing up in \nthe birth family without professional surveillance.   \n \n 21\nThe problem is: who has the power to listen to the child\u2019s voice?  The social worker \nmay be willing and anxious to empower the child yet themselves feel restricted in the \nautonomy they have.  Management will be setting out objectives and priorities that \nthey are under pressure to meet.  If a sixteen year old says he thinks the Action and \nAssessment Record is intrusive and unhelpful and he would prefer to spend the time \ntalking to his social worker instead of completing it (as one young person in this study \ndid), the social worker would face the dilemma of listening to the child or to the \nmanager. \n \nRecent changes in child care social work are all having the effect of limiting the social \nworker\u2019s autonomy and imposing a standardised system.  While there is strong \nevidence of the need to improve the quality of care (Triseliotis et al, 1995), an \nunintended consequence of standardisation is that it limits freedom to respond to the \nchild\u2019s wishes and opinions and embodies an assumption that professionals know best \nabout what the child needs.  Empowerment, however, is a developmental task that the \nchild needs to accomplish to reach mature adulthood.  There is a danger that, in trying \nto ensure maximum care for a looked after child, professionals may, inadvertently, \noverprotect them from one of the crucial stages of maturation.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nReferences \n \nArchard D.
