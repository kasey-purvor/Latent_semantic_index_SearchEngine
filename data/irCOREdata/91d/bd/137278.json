Harrison, A. Dunkley RACING INTAKE SYSTEM ACOUSTICS, Revision 2\n3\n1 Introduction\nNaturally aspirated racing engines have tuned intake systems and can now achieve volumetric\nefficiencies in excess of 125% and peak engine speeds in excess of 18,000 rev\/min.\nEngines designed for single seater racing commonly dispense with the intake manifold and its\nconvoluted and restricting flow path preferring single lengths of pipe feeding each cylinder\nseparately. In the main, the engine tuning process involves the selection of an appropriate\npipe length along with the sizing and timing of the intake (and exhaust) valves in order to\nharness the unsteady flow in the intake to produce improved volumetric efficiency.\nThe V10 Formula 1 engine sits a little way behind the driver. Ten short lengths of vertically\naligned intake pipe feed the ten cylinders. These pipes are contained in an airbox of several\nlitres capacity located directly over the engine. This airbox is fed with air collected from\nabove the driver\u2019s head and delivered by a large flared air-horn that is about three-quarters of\none metre long.\nTraditional trial and error tuning on the dynamometer is nowadays supported by engine\nsimulations on the computer. These take account of the unsteady flow in the intake (and\nexhaust) pipes as well as the unsteady mass transfer through the valves using one-\ndimensional (1D) models in the time domain [1]. The special requirements for such\nsimulations when applied to racing engines have been investigated [2] and good agreement\nhas been found between measured and calculated pressures in the intake systems of high-\nspeed engines. Notwithstanding this, most engine developers still rely on engine tests to\nverify and extend the results from simulations. For the very high performance engines such\nM.F. Harrison, A. Dunkley RACING INTAKE SYSTEM ACOUSTICS, Revision 2\n4\nas the 600 kW V10 used in Formula 1 racing it is convenient to test single cylinder engines,\nbeing in essence one cylinder sawn off the V10. A sketch of the intake portion of such an\nengine is shown in Figure 1.\nThe advantage of the single cylinder engine is a much lower running cost. A Formula 1\nengine has a service life of only one or two hours when operating at full load. After that time,\na near complete rebuild of the engine is required. The cost advantage of the single cylinder\nengine comes from a much reduced rebuild time and the need for service parts (bearings,\npiston, piston rings, seals) for only one cylinder rather than ten.\nFor the single cylinder engine sketched in Figure 1 a large plenum (30 litres) is placed at the\nopen end of the flared intake pipe to reproduce the effect of the 30 litre airbox on the V10.\nDynamic pressure measurements made in the plenum of the running engine show only slight\nfluctuations in pressure compared with the large fluctuation seen in the intake pipe [3]. This\nsuggests that the plenum is large enough to attenuate the fluctuating pressure amplitude at\nthat location. It is commonly hoped that this attenuation means that the intake pipes are\neffectively decoupled from the remainder of the intake system, which normally includes an\nair conditioning unit to control the temperature, pressure and humidity of the air delivered to\nthe engine. It is also commonly hoped that the airbox on the V10 performs the same\ndecoupling function.\nThe main difficulty with the use of a single cylinder engine is that the measured performance\ndoes not closely match that obtained with the V10 [3]. The reasons for this have been\ninvestigated [3,4]. The first reason is simply that the friction levels per cylinder are higher in\nthe single cylinder engine due to the extra mechanical systems (such as balance shafts)\nM.F. Harrison, A. Dunkley RACING INTAKE SYSTEM ACOUSTICS, Revision 2\n5\nrequired to balance the engine. The second reason is the absence of exhaust tuning effects\nfound with the V10 where five cylinders in a bank empty into a common exhaust pipe. The\nthird reason, which is the subject of this paper, is due to the unsteady cyclic nature of the\nintake flow. The term \u2018wave action\u2019 is commonly used to describe such flow and it comprises\ntwo effects: resonant acoustic behaviour and an \u2018inertial ram effect\u2019.\nThe inertial ram effect has been reported before. Dennison [5] found that the optimum\nsupercharging effect occurred with a pipe of only 52% of the length that Capetti predicted\nwould yield the lowest resonance frequency of a simple intake pipe using his resonant wave\naction theory [6]. On the basis of this he rejected the theory of resonance as being of \u201clittle\nmore than academic interest\u201d when it came to improving engine performance and he\ndeveloped a theory of supercharging by inertia effects. His calculations based solely on\ninertia effects, did not match his experimental results very well.\nTaylor et al [7] expanded the investigation to take account of both inertial and acoustic\nresonance effects. Both were found to be important, the relative importance of each varying\nwith engine speed and intake pipe length. Variations with valve timing and with inlet pipe\ndiameter were also reported. For operating conditions yielding the greatest volumetric\nefficiency, their results showed the inertial ramming effect to be the most significant.\nWave action in intake (and exhaust) systems is most conveniently calculated using a time-\nmarching solver to the well-known gas-dynamic equations [1]. In this way, both resonant\nacoustic and inertial ram effects are considered. Such solvers form the basis to engine\nperformance simulation methods, of which several computer codes are available\ncommercially.\nM.F. Harrison, A. Dunkley RACING INTAKE SYSTEM ACOUSTICS, Revision 2\n6\nA commercial engine simulation code (known as AVL Boost) has been used to calculate the\nintake wave dynamics in a single cylinder Formula 1 engine [4]. The code uses a finite-\nvolume shock-capturing scheme [8] as the wave action solver and is taken to be a good\nrepresentative example of the current state of the art in such codes.\nFigure: 2 shows the pressure time history measured in the intake port of the single cylinder\nFormula 1 engine sketched in Figure: 1, operating at 10,000 revmin-1 wide-open throttle. The\nresults of two engine simulations are also shown where the gas exchange in the cylinder, the\ncombustion, and the intake and exhaust wave action have been included in the modelling. In\nthe first model, only the intake port geometry is included, neglecting the 30 litre plenum and\nthe air horn beyond. In the second model, the full intake geometry is included. The results\nfrom the two simulations are very similar to each other and both broadly agree with the\nmeasured results, although some differences in detail are obvious. The degree of agreement\nshown was only found when the intake port was modelled as a 175mm long section of pipe\nwhereas its physical length was known to be 150mm. The need for such \u2018end corrections\u2019 has\nbeen noticed in other simulations of this type [2, 4].\nOn the basis of validation such as this, engine simulations of this type have been commended\nfor use in racing engine design and development. However, a study of the theoretical\nbackground to current engine simulations has identified areas where the realism of the\nmodelling might be improved.\nAt present, the gas conditions in intake system plena tend to be calculated in the same manner\nas the gas exchange in the cylinder. The plenum is treated as a zero dimensional volume and\nrates of mass inflow\/outflow are calculated using an idealised model of the flow through an\nM.F. Harrison, A. Dunkley RACING INTAKE SYSTEM ACOUSTICS, Revision 2\n7\norifice that is corrected using empirical flow coefficients. This has important implications.\nFirstly, the plenum has no length and therefore higher frequency acoustic resonances cannot\nbe modelled and secondly the results obtained are strongly determined by the choice of inlet\nand outlet flow coefficients. In Figure: 2, inlet and outlet flow coefficients were somewhat\narbitrarily set to a value of 0.95. Lower values would have reduced the fluctuating intake\npressure amplitudes obtained from the model.\nAt present, the rate of inflow to the intake system is calculated assuming stagnation\nconditions outside the duct [1]. The implications of this are: firstly, the resulting quasi-steady\nstate model is unlikely to be fully realistic in racing engines where the intake valve actuates at\na frequency of 150 Hz at 18,000 revmin-1; secondly, the intake air is gathered from above the\ndriver\u2019s head in an airstream that is far from stagnant, having a race-average velocity\napproaching 60 ms-1.\nIn order to begin to address some of these issues, a linear acoustic model has been employed\nhere to calculate the intake wave action in a single cylinder Formula 1 engine. The relevant\nattributes of the method are: firstly the model for the inflow to the system is dynamic, being\nbounded by an acoustic reflection coefficient that varies with frequency; secondly, plena are\nmodelled with a length dimension and thus wave action therein is included; thirdly the\nmethod is simple thus providing an alternative insight into intake wave action that might\notherwise be hidden in the time-marching numerics of conventional engine simulations.\nM.F. Harrison, A. Dunkley RACING INTAKE SYSTEM ACOUSTICS, Revision 2\n8\n2 The acoustics of the intake system\nConsider the intake system of the single cylinder engine as sketched in Figure 1. If the\nengine were disconnected from the air-conditioning system then the acoustics of the V10\ninstallation in the car could be approximated by feeding the plenum with air directly from the\ndynamometer cell via a large bore straight walled pipe the same length as the air-horn. This\nhas been tested [3]. The cone angles of the flared inlet and outlet of the plenum are large\nenough to suggest the adoption of a simplified model of the intake system as shown in\nFigure: 3.\nFigures: 4,5 show intake pressures measured on the single cylinder engine at 13,000 revmin-1\nand 7000 revmin-1 respectively. In each case, measurements were made using a piezo-\nresistive pressure transducer (Kistler type 4045A2) in the short intake pipe near to the back of\nthe intake valve(s). A crankshaft encoder was used to divide the pressure records so obtained\ninto short lengths, each one being the data relating to a different four-stroke cycle. These data\nsets were ensemble averaged to obtain an average pressure record for one full cycle and\nlabelled with the key valve events (intake valve opening (IVO), intake valve closing (IVC),\nexhaust valve closing (EVC)) and the important piston positions (90 degrees after top dead\ncentre (ATDC) where the piston velocity is greatest and bottom dead centre (BDC) where it\nis instantaneously zero).\nThe intake pressure record in Figure: 4 has certain features that are similar to intake pressures\nmeasured on another single cylinder engine running at low speeds [9]. Firstly, there is a\ndecaying pressure oscillation in the period IVC-IVO. Secondly, there is a pressure depression\ncentred on 90 degrees ATDC corresponding to the maximum piston velocity. Thirdly, there is\nM.F. Harrison, A. Dunkley RACING INTAKE SYSTEM ACOUSTICS, Revision 2\n9\na pressure peak just before IVC. However, the peak found at 13,000 revmin-1 with this engine\nis different from the one found at 2000 revmin-1 on the low speed engine [9]. The height of\nthe peak on the low speed engine matched the depth of the depression that preceded it\nsuggesting the dominance of an acoustic oscillation about the prevailing stagnation pressure.\nIn the racing engine, the height of the peak (0.6 bar) is much larger than the depth of the\ndepression (0.25 bar). This suggests that in addition to there being an acoustic oscillation\npresent, there is some transfer of momentum in the late intake flow that causes a pressure rise\nbehind the closing intake valve(s). That effect (often called inertial ram) seems to account for\n0.35 bar of the 0.6 bar pressure peak and therefore seems to be the dominant effect at this\nengine speed.\nThe conclusions reached by Taylor et al [7] are in line with the observations made with\nrespect to Figure: 4. The speed of 13,000 revmin-1 corresponds to the speed region of very\nhigh volumetric efficiency for the racing engine, and the inertial effects do seem to be more\nsignificant than the acoustic resonance effects.\nThe pressure record in Figure: 5 corresponds to the lowest practical speed for a racing engine\n(7000 revmin-1) where the volumetric efficiency of the engine is known to be poor. The fact\nthat it is poor is not surprising as there is no evidence of inertial ram effects and only slight\nevidence of acoustic resonance effects as there is hardly any pressure peak before IVC. The\npressure depression occurs before 90 degrees ATDC, an effect that has been noticed on\nanother single cylinder engine operating at 1000 revmin-1 (the lowest practical running speed\nfor that engine) as shown in Figure: 6. The pressure records in Figures: 5 and 6 have very\nsimilar features showing that poor volumetric efficiency at the lowest speeds corresponds to a\npressure depression soon after IVO and very weak wave action to follow.\nM.F. Harrison, A. Dunkley RACING INTAKE SYSTEM ACOUSTICS, Revision 2\n10\nThe frequency at which the pressure oscillates in the intake pipe of the racing engine has been\nestimated by finding the time interval between successive pressure minima in Figures: 4 and\n5. At 13,000 revmin-1, the pressure oscillates at 600Hz directly after IVC, then at 629 Hz for\nthe next oscillation and then at 690 Hz for the last oscillation before IVO. So, the oscillation\nfrequency varies during the cycle, the variation being some 15% when the valve is closed.\nThis may simply be due to the variation in the flow Mach number which will drop from\naround 0.15M at IVC to near zero at the next IVO. The corresponding oscillation frequencies\nfor the 7000 revmin-1 case are 506 Hz, 525 Hz, 552 Hz, (362 Hz \u2013 double minimum present),\n545 Hz.\nThese variations in oscillation frequency were not found when the wave action was\ninvestigated in the intake system of a low speed engine [9].\nThe average pressure record from one cycle shown in Figure: 4 has been repeated many times\nto form a long data sequence. By using a moving Hanning window to produce the average of\nmany 4096 point FFTs the spectrum shown in Figure: 7 was produced with a spectral\nresolution of 19Hz due to the sample frequency being 78 kHz. The same technique applied to\nthe data in Figure: 5 yields a spectrum of the intake pressure at 7000 revmin-1 with a\nfrequency resolution of 10 Hz (the sample frequency being 42 kHz) as shown in Figure: 8.\nInspecting Figure: 7, the dominant frequency component of the intake pressure is 438 Hz.\nThis is the 4th harmonic of the intake valve actuation frequency at 13,000 revmin-1. The other\nspectral components are the other integer harmonics of the cycle frequency (1, 2nd , 3rd etc).\nThe arithmetic mean of the closed valve oscillations is 640Hz which is close to the 6th\nharmonic of the cycle frequency (648 Hz).\nM.F. Harrison, A. Dunkley RACING INTAKE SYSTEM ACOUSTICS, Revision 2\n11\nInspecting Figure: 8, the dominant frequency component of the intake pressure is 174 Hz.\nThis is the 3rd harmonic of the intake valve actuation frequency at 7000 revmin-1. As before,\nthe other spectral components are the other integer harmonics of the cycle frequency. The\narithmetic mean of the closed valve oscillations is 504Hz which does not coincide with any\nof the harmonics of the cycle frequency. This suggests that any acoustic resonance present is\nonly weak.\nFor a low speed single cylinder engine with a long straight pipe intake system, the following\nhypothesis was developed [9]:\nThe early stages of the intake process are governed by the instantaneous values of the piston\nvelocity and the open area under the valve. Thereafter the effects of acoustic resonance\ndominate the process. The depth of the early depression caused by the moving piston\ngoverns the intensity of the wave action that follows. A pressure ratio across the valve that is\nfavourable to inflow is maintained and maximised when the open period of the valve is such\nto allow at least, but no more than, one complete oscillation of the pressure at its resonant\nfrequency to occur whilst the valve is open.\nThe racing engine studied here deviates from that hypothesis in two ways. Firstly, at high\nspeeds inertial ram effects dominate the intake process rather than the seemingly weaker\nacoustic resonance effects. Secondly, at low speeds, there is no evidence of inertial ram\neffects and any acoustic resonance effects seem to be weak.\nM.F. Harrison, A. Dunkley RACING INTAKE SYSTEM ACOUSTICS, Revision 2\n12\n3 Overview of the acoustic model\nThe acoustic model employed for this study has been described in detail elsewhere [9], so\nonly an overview of the calculation method will be given here. The model calculates the\nresonant response of the intake system, characterised by the pressure time history P1 in the\nintake port, to a forcing due to the volume velocity U1 passing through the intake valve.\nThe model may be described using the equivalent acoustic circuit shown in Figure: 9. The\nintake process involves two acoustic loads Ze and Z1 acting on a volume velocity source of\nstrength Vs and producing the pressure P1. The source impedance Ze is a function of the\ngeometry of the opening and closing intake valve as well as the flow pattern between the\nintake port and the cylinder. Its physical location in the engine is shown in Figure: 10. The\nload impedance Z1 is a function of the wave action in the intake port and in the rest of the\nintake system. Its physical location in the engine is also shown in Figure: 10.\nAfter a study of the intake wave action in a low speed engine [9], it was determined that the\ninfluence of Ze must be small compared with the influence of Z1 and therefore Ze could be\nneglected. Therefore, the intake problem reduces to the solution of:\n11 ZUP s\uf03d (1)\nThe model adopted here can be described as a hybrid method [10] because it combines a time\ndomain model for Us with a frequency domain model for Z1 to produce a time domain\ncalculation of P1. However, it is more correctly described as an uncoupled hybrid method\nM.F. Harrison, A. Dunkley RACING INTAKE SYSTEM ACOUSTICS, Revision 2\n13\nbecause it does not include the interaction between the engine as acoustic source (Us and Ze)\nand the acoustic load (Z1) imposed by the intake system.\nIn the uncoupled hybrid method, U1 is estimated from engine geometry. In the true hybrid\nmethod U1 is equal to Us \u2013 Ue and Us is a function of: cylinder dimensions (bore, stroke,\ncompression ratio), engine speed, scavenging of residual exhaust gas (in turn a function of\nexhaust wave dynamics), valve geometry, valve timing, in-cylinder gas temperatures. Ue is\nassociated with flow losses in the valve.\nTherefore, in essence the various hybrid methods in the literature [11 - 19] calculate Us, Ue,\nZe, Z1, U1, P1 whereas in the uncoupled hybrid method used here Z1 is calculated, Ze is\nneglected, U1 is estimated and these are used to calculate an approximate P1.\n3.1 The model for volume velocity U1\nAn estimate for U1 is calculated in two steps. A first estimate is obtained from\nU1 =\n1\nvd\nS\nS\nx\ntd\nVd\n(2)\nwhere U1 is time varying and it is a function of the rate of change of cylinder volume Vd and\nof the instantaneous flow area under the valve Sv and of the intake port area S1. The results\nfrom this calculation at 13,000 revmin-1 are shown in Figure: 11 (the dimensions of the\nengine geometry are not given here in order to respect the confidentiality of the engine\nbuilders). The second stage calculation is a scaling of the time history of flow area under the\nopening and closing intake valve(s) (obtained by calculating the curtain area around the base\nM.F. Harrison, A. Dunkley RACING INTAKE SYSTEM ACOUSTICS, Revision 2\n14\nof the opening valve for every degree of crankshaft rotation) so that the scaled results pass\nthrough the maximum value calculated from (2). No physical significance is placed on this\nchoice of scaling, it is merely convenient and appears to be effective.\nThe results from the first and second stage estimates for U1 are shown for a speed of 13,000\nrevmin-1 in Figure: 12 and for 7000 revmin-1 in Figure: 13. In addition, measurements of U1\nare also presented [3] and the agreement between these and the second stage estimates are\nseen to be good in a general sense. However, the measured results clearly show a smaller\namplitude oscillation superimposed on a larger amplitude envelope. In developing the models\nfor estimating U1 the uncoupled assumption was adopted and the effects of Ze were\nneglected. If the flow through the valve(s) were truly uncoupled from the wave action in the\nintake system then the detail of a good estimate for U1 should agree with measured results.\nThe presence of the smaller amplitude oscillation in the measured results suggests that either\nthe oscillation is due to the use of measured data acquired in the intake port rather than at the\nactual valve seat or there is some coupling present. If the latter is assumed to be true then Ze\nshould be included in the model, but in the case of the high engine speed results its influence\nis of second order importance as the amplitude of the oscillation is small compared to the\namplitude of the envelope. Inspecting Figure: 13, the influence of what might be assumed to\nbe coupling is clearly more important at lower engine speeds. Notwithstanding this\nsuggestion of some coupling between acoustic source and acoustic load, the uncoupled\nassumption is retained here as it allows the creation of a simple model that has proved to\nvalidate reasonably well against experiment.\nTo obtain the measurements of U1 (the volume velocity through the intake valve, at a position\nin the intake port just behind the intake valve(s)) a calculation was made based on the\nM.F. Harrison, A. Dunkley RACING INTAKE SYSTEM ACOUSTICS, Revision 2\n15\npressure ratio across the opening and closing intake valve [3, 20]. The inputs to this\ncalculation are simultaneous measurements of the cylinder pressure and of the pressure in the\nintake port just behind the intake valve(s) (Figures: 14, 15). These require some careful cross\ncalibration to overcome DC drift problems commonly encountered with cylinder pressure\nmeasurements as described in [20]. The measured pressure ratio across the intake valve may\nbe used in a classical model for the flow through poppet valves [21] to calculate the mass\nflow rate through the valve:\n2\n1\n\u03b3\n1\u03b3\nC\n1\n\u03b3\n2\nC\n1\n2\nC\neC\nP\nP\n1\nP\nP\n1\u03b3\n\u03b32\nc\nAP\nm\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\uf02d\uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\n\uf02d\n\uf026 (3)\nwhere\nPC = cylinder pressure (Pa)\nP1 = intake port pressure (Pa)\ncc = speed of sound in the cylinder\nAe = Am C\nAm = valve open area (m2)\nC = flow loss coefficient (measured on a flow bench)\nBy assuming stagnation conditions in the cylinder, and by using the value for the prevailing\nstagnation density, the volume velocity through the intake valve can be calculated as shown\nin Figures: 12,13.\nThe second-stage estimate of U1 from Figure: 12 has been interpolated so that it forms part of\na 64 point data sequence to describe the 7200 of crankshaft rotation for the four-stroke cycle\nas shown in Figure: 16. The single calculated cycle shown in Figure: 12 was repeated many\nM.F. Harrison, A. Dunkley RACING INTAKE SYSTEM ACOUSTICS, Revision 2\n16\ntimes in a long sequence and by using a moving Hanning window to produce an average of\nmany 1024 point FFTs the spectrum shown in Figure: 16 was produced with a spectral\nresolution of around 7 Hz due to the sample frequency being 6933Hz. It is clear that every\ninteger harmonic of the valve actuation frequency of 108 Hz is present in this spectrum. This\nexplains the presence of these spectral components in the corresponding intake port pressure\nspectrum shown in Figure: 7.\n3.2 The model for the acoustic load impedance Z1\nA one-dimensional, linear, plane-wave, frequency domain model of the simplified intake\nsystem shown in Figure: 3 has been prepared [9, 22].\nThe starting point for the acoustic calculations is the known reflection coefficient at the open\nend of the long air-horn\n\uf02b\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\n4\n4\n4 p\np\nr (4)\nThat reflection coefficient is known for the case of inflow to a pipe with a slight bellmouth,\nwhere there is no flow separation on entry and the flow outside of the pipe is essentially\nstagnant [22]. The reflection coefficient varies with Mach number in the pipe as well as being\nsubject to the addition of a small end correction to the length of the pipe to take account of\nthe phase of r4. As a result, two calculations are performed [9], one for the open valve\ncondition where the mean Mach number in the short intake pipe is high (0.13M) and one for\nM.F. Harrison, A. Dunkley RACING INTAKE SYSTEM ACOUSTICS, Revision 2\n17\nthe closed valve condition when the mean Mach number in the short intake pipe is low\n(0.05M).\nAn acoustic transfer is made between r4 at the open end to r1 at the intake valve position\n\uf02b\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\n1\n1\n1 p\np\nr (5)\nwhere the effects of pipe lengths, sudden expansions and sudden contractions in the flow duct\nare considered [22]. The final result is the specific acoustic impedance ratio\n1\n1\n1 r1\nr1\u03b6\n\uf02d\n\uf02b\uf03d (6)\nwhere\n1oo11 Sc\u03c1\u03b6Z \uf03d co = stagnation sound speed (7)\n\u03c1o = stagnation speed density\nS1 = cross sectional area of the intake port\nThe specific acoustic impedance ratios corresponding to the open and closed valve cases at\n13,000 revmin-1 are shown in Figure: 17. The increased mean Mach number in the open valve\ncase reduces the magnitude of the acoustic impedance at the two resonant frequencies (542\nHz, 1733 Hz) which are clearly shown as peaks in the impedance.\nM.F. Harrison, A. Dunkley RACING INTAKE SYSTEM ACOUSTICS, Revision 2\n18\n3.3 Calculating the intake port pressure P1\nFollowing on from equation 1:\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\uf05b \uf05dfZfUIFFTtP 11\uf03d1 (8)\nU1 (f) is found by taking a single 64 point FFT of the 64 points used in the model to describe\nU1 for one cycle as shown in Figure:16. In order to obtain the product in equation (8), the\nspecific acoustic impedance ratio spectra shown in Figure 17 should be recalculated to be a\n64 point double sided spectra with a resolution that matches U1 (f).\nThe inverse Fourier transform of equation (8) must be performed twice, once for the open\nvalve values of Z1 and once for the closed valve values. The resulting time histories of P1 are\nshown for 13,000 revmin-1 in Figure 18.\nIn order to complete the calculation of P1, the 64-point sequences from equation (8) must first\nbe interpolated to 720-point sequences, one value for each degree of crankshaft rotation in the\nfour-stroke cycle. The first few data points from the open valve sequence correspond to the\nvalues of P1 for the interval IVO-IVC. The corresponding values from the closed valve\nsequence are discarded. The remaining values from the closed valve sequence correspond to\nthe values of P1 for the period when the valve is closed. The pressure in the intake system\nwill be the composite P1 added to the prevailing static pressure. The final composite curve\nwill exhibit discontinuities at both IVO and IVC. These are evident by close inspection of the\nresults presented in this paper as no attempts to smooth the transitions have been made.\nM.F. Harrison, A. Dunkley RACING INTAKE SYSTEM ACOUSTICS, Revision 2\n19\n4 Results and discussion\n4.1 Results obtained using the acoustic model\nThe acoustic model described in Section 3 has been used to calculate the pressure P1 in the\nintake port of the racing engine sketched in Figure: 1. This has been done for two engine\nspeeds. The first at 13,000 revmin-1 corresponds to a speed at which very high volumetric\nefficiency is expected, and the second at 7000 revmin-1 is the lowest practical running speed\nfor this engine. The calculated intake port pressure at 13,000 revmin-1 is shown in Figure: 19\nalong with the measured average pressure record from Figure: 4. There are some important\ndifferences in the results.\nFirstly, when the valve is closed, the calculation results show a decaying pressure oscillation\nwith a frequency of 565Hz for the first cycle of oscillation after IVC. The frequency was\nobtained using the method described in Section 2 and is close to both the 5th harmonic of the\ncycle frequency at 540 Hz and to the lowest resonant frequency of the intake system at 542\nHz. The frequency for the first cycle of oscillation in the measured data was found to be\n600Hz. For the second cycle of oscillation, the calculated frequency is 574 Hz and the\nmeasured frequency is 629 Hz. Therefore, the stretching of the pressure wavelength as the\noscillation decays after IVC first noted in the experimental results is reproduced to some\nsmall degree by the calculation. However, the resonant frequencies shown in the calculated\nresults are too low. The acoustic length of the intake pipe must be shorter than the 150mm\nplus end correction assumed in the modelling (the end correction being 13.8mm at the lowest\nHelmholtz number and 10.5mm at the highest).\nM.F. Harrison, A. Dunkley RACING INTAKE SYSTEM ACOUSTICS, Revision 2\n20\nThe second difference is that the inertial ram effects suggested in the measured data and\ndiscussed in Section 2 are not included in the calculated results and therefore the calculated\npressure peak just before IVC is lower. The reason for this is straightforward. The acoustic\nmodel calculates the resonant pressure response of the intake system to a volume velocity\nexcitation and any momentum transfer (the inertial ram effect) from the mean flow is not\nincluded in the model. It seems from the results in Figure: 19 that this momentum transfer has\nthe effect of adding to the pressure peak just before IVC caused by acoustic resonance\neffects. Because the amplitude of the pressure peak just before IVC is lower in the calculated\nresults, the amplitude of the pressure peaks that follow in the period IVC-IVO are also lower.\nFigure: 20 shows a comparison between calculated and measured intake port pressures at\n7000 revmin-1. This time the decaying pressure oscillation after IVC in the calculated results\nhas cycle frequencies of 575 Hz, 538 Hz, 591 Hz, 538 Hz, 575 Hz respectively. These\ncompare to the frequencies discussed in Section 2 which were 506 Hz, 525 Hz, 552 Hz, (362\nHz \u2013 double minimum present), 545 Hz. There is a variation in oscillation frequency in both\ncases although the rather unusual 4th oscillation found in the measured results is not replicated\nby the calculation and therefore the overall agreement is reduced. The intake behaviour at\nlow speeds seems to be fairly well modelled and therefore the effect of weak acoustic\nresonance seems to dominate the behaviour, in contrast to the strong inertial ram effect\nsuspected at higher speeds.\n4.2 Results that include a simple model of the inertia ram effect\nThe discussion in Section 4.1 highlights the need to include the inertial ram effect in a\ncalculation of the high speed inlet flow to a racing engine. Therefore, the acoustic model\nM.F. Harrison, A. Dunkley RACING INTAKE SYSTEM ACOUSTICS, Revision 2\n21\ndescribed in Section 3 has been extended with the simplest possible model of the inertial ram\neffect. The momentum \u03a6 of the intake flow is taken to be:\n1110\u03c1\u03a6 ulS\uf03d (9)\nwhere\n\u03c10 = stagnation density of the inlet air (kgm-3)\nS1 = effective cross sectional area of conical of inlet pipe (m2)\nl1 = length of inlet pipe (m)\nu1 = flow velocity in the intake pipe (ms-1)\n1\n1\n1 S\n)t(U\n)t(u \uf03d (10)\nThe transfer of momentum as the intake flow is brought to rest on the back of the closing\nvalve causes a rise in pressure PIR due to the inertial ram effect given by\n1\nIR S\n1\ndt\nd\n)t(P \uf0b4\uf03d \u03c6 (11)\nThe simplifying assumption made here is that the flow is incompressible, therefore there is a\nconstant density equal to \u03c10 down the length of the intake pipe. The dominant pressure\nfluctuation occurs at around 600 Hz and therefore the length of the 150mm intake pipe is\naround \u00bc of the dominant wavelength. This is too high a proportion of one wavelength to\nsupport the simplifying assumption, but because of its ease of use it will be retained until a\nbetter alternative is developed.\nM.F. Harrison, A. Dunkley RACING INTAKE SYSTEM ACOUSTICS, Revision 2\n22\nFigure: 21 shows the results of the extended calculation method at 13,000 revmin-1. The\ninertial ram effect has been included only for the portion of the period IVO-IVC where the\nvalve is closing. In addition, the results in the period IVC-IVO have been scaled by the factor\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\uf05b \uf05d\n\uf028 \uf029\uf05b \uf05d IVCIVOmax1\nIVCIVOmaxIRmax1\nP\nPP\nfactor\n\uf02d\n\uf02d\uf02b\uf03d (12)\nto reflect the increased pressure pulse around IVC that immediately precedes the period IVC-\nIVO. The agreement between calculated and measured results is much better for the extended\nmodel than was obtained using the acoustic model described in Section 3. The need to\ninclude even the simplest model of the inertial ram effect at high engine speeds such as this\none is clear.\nFigure: 22 shows the results obtained from the extended model at 7000 revmin-1. The added\ninertial ram effects are clearly too strong in this low speed case. Unfortunately, there is no\nmeans at present of predicting the onset of the inertial ram effect with increasing speed. A\nsimple rule of including inertial ram effects at speeds above say 2\/3 of the rated engine speed\nmight prove acceptable in practice but there is no physical justification for this.\nAn alternative form of validation of the extended calculations is offered. The spectra of\ncalculated and measured intake port pressures are compared in Figures: 23, 24. These spectra\nhave been produced by repeating the single cycle data from Figures: 21, 22 many times to\nform long data sequences. By using a moving Hanning window to produce averages of many\n4096 point FFTs the spectra shown in Figures: 23, 24 were produced with a spectral\nresolution of 19 Hz and 10 Hz respectively due to the sample frequency being 78 kHz and 42\nM.F. Harrison, A. Dunkley RACING INTAKE SYSTEM ACOUSTICS, Revision 2\n23\nkHz respectively. In both speed cases, the calculated sound pressure level is within 5 dB of\nthe measured value for the majority of the first ten harmonics of the cycle frequency.\nThe agreement between measured and the calculated results is fair. Any lack of agreement\nmight be due to: oversimplification of the acoustic model where wide-angle cones were\nmodelled as straight pipes of the same length, oversimplification of the effects of un-steady\nflow modelled as an equivalent mean flow, the use of a reflective boundary at the open end\nwhich has not been validated at high Mach numbers and with high sound levels,\noversimplified modelling of the inertial ram effects, or the effects of flow induced noise.\nA comment is offered on the usefulness of the extended acoustic model presented here. It is\nfair to say that a time domain solution to the equations of fluid motion offers the best way to\ncalculate both acoustic resonance and inertial ram effects together. The use of such approach\nhas been discussed in the introduction to this paper and some validation of the results is\noffered there. However, it is impossible to distinguish between the acoustic resonance effects\nand the inertial ram effects with such an approach, whereas the extended acoustic model does\nallow that distinction, albeit in a rather simplified form.\nM.F. Harrison, A. Dunkley RACING INTAKE SYSTEM ACOUSTICS, Revision 2\n24\n4.3 A case study: the influence of the intake plenum\nTo illustrate how the extended linear acoustic model might be used to better understand the\nintake wave action in a racing engine, a case study is offered where the decoupling effect of\nthe plenum used in the intake of the single cylinder engine sketched in Figure: 1 is assessed.\nThe acoustic characteristics of the simplified model of the single cylinder intake system\nshown in Figure: 3 can be described thus.\nThe maximum attenuation of the sound wave emanating from the intake valve is due to the\nplenum is given by:\nAttenuation = 20 log10 \uf02b\n\uf02b\n2\n1\np\np \u2248 20 log10\n1\n2\nS\nS\n= 12 dB (13)\nThis will only be obtained at frequencies away from resonance in the plenum. Assuming a\nparallel-piped plenum, these resonant frequencies can be estimated from:\nx\nnc\nf\n2\n\uf03d n = 1, 2, 3\u2026 (14)\nx = 0.41 m\nc = 343 m\/s\nf1 = 418 Hz f2 = 836 Hz f3 = 1672 Hz\nThe attenuation of the plenum at these resonant frequencies will tend to zero dB.\nM.F. Harrison, A. Dunkley RACING INTAKE SYSTEM ACOUSTICS, Revision 2\n25\nThe intake wave action is expected at a frequency that is near to the lowest resonant\nfrequency of the short intake pipe, given by [9]:\nx\nnc\nf\n4\n\uf03d n = 1, 3, 5\u2026 (15)\nx = 0.15m\nc = 343 m\/s\nf1 = 572 Hz f2 = 1716 Hz\nThe resonant frequency of 572Hz is neatly between the two lowest resonant frequencies of\nthe plenum (418 Hz and 836 Hz) and so the attenuation of the plenum should be near 12dB at\n572 Hz. Therefore, the plenum ought to decouple the wave action in the short intake pipe\nfrom the wave action in the rest of the intake system. If the short intake pipe had been any\nlonger (say 200mm) then the two resonant frequencies would have coincided and the\ndecoupling would be expected to be poor.\nThis simple analysis suggests that the plenum will decouple the intake pipe from the rest of\nthe intake system when a 410mm long, 300mm diameter plenum is used with a 150mm long,\n50mm diameter intake pipe. Thus, any differences in the indicated mean effective pressures\nmeasured on the single cylinder engine and on the V10 ought not to be due to differences in\nintake wave action, but perhaps differences in exhaust wave action.\nHowever, this simple analysis is not completely reliable as it is hard to judge exactly which\nfrequency components will dominate the wave action in the intake system.\nM.F. Harrison, A. Dunkley RACING INTAKE SYSTEM ACOUSTICS, Revision 2\n26\nThe acoustic model can be used to assess the effect of the plenum directly. Figures: 25, 26\nshow a comparison of calculated results where the whole intake system has been modelled\nand other results where only the 150mm intake pipe has been modelled. The fact that there\nare only slight differences between the two sets of results suggests that the decoupling\nachieved by the 30 litre plenum is strong but not perfect. Therefore, there may be slight\nvariations in the intake behaviour of the single cylinder engine when compared with V10\nengines either on the dynamometer or installed in the car, assuming that the decoupling\nprovided by the 30 litre V10 airbox is equally strong. These variations will only be small and\nwill only be responsible for minor differences in indicated mean effective pressure. Any\nsignificant differences in engine performance are likely to be due to some other factor such as\ndifferences in the exhaust action.\nM.F. Harrison, A. Dunkley RACING INTAKE SYSTEM ACOUSTICS, Revision 2\n27\n5 Conclusions\nAn investigation into the intake process on a single cylinder racing engine has shown that\ninertial ram effects make a strong contribution to the intake process at high engine speeds\nwhereas acoustic resonance effects are more important to the rather weak wave action that\noccurs at low engine speeds.\nAn acoustic model of the acoustic resonance effect has proved useful in distinguishing\nbetween these two mechanisms. A simple model of the inertial ram effect has also proved\nuseful.\nA decoupled hybrid method has been shown to yield calculations of the wave dynamics in the\nintake system of a single cylinder racing engine that show at least fair agreement with\nmeasured results up to the 10th harmonic of the engine cycle frequency.\nThe intake characteristics of a single cylinder racing engine have been shown to be only\nslightly different from those expected from a V10 engine due to the decoupling effects of the\nplenum fitted to the intake of the single cylinder engine and the airbox fitted to the V10.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors thank Ilmor Racing Engines for their permission to publish the second author\u2019s\nmeasured data in this paper.\nThe first author gratefully acknowledges the support of EPSRC for the theoretical aspects of\nthis work made possible under grant No: GR\/R04324.\nM.F.
