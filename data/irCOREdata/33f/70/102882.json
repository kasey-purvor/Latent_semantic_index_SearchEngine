Amorphous carbon films\nwith a high fraction of sp3 hybridized carbons have been\ndeposited by filtered cathodic vacuum arc ~FCVA!2\u20134 and\nmass selected ion beams.5\u20138 C1 ions are used to deposit the\namorphous carbon films by both techniques. Different\nmechanisms for the formation of the sp3 rich phase have\nbeen proposed such as the shallow implantation process\n~subplantation! by Lifshitz et al.,5,6 selective sputtering pro-\ncesses by Reinke and Kuhr9 ~discussed for c-BN!, and stress-\ninduced phase transition processes by McKenzie et al.3,10\nAnalytical expressions for the subplantation process describ-\ning the formation of stress and the densification have been\nproposed by Davis11 and Robertson.12 The basic idea of the\nmodels by Davis and Robertson is that a carbon ion needs at\nleast the displacement energy to penetrate into the carbon\nfilm leading to a densification of subsurface layers of the\nevolving film.6 But, not all the energy of the energetic carbon\nion is used for penetration ~displacement processes!. Part of\nthe ion energy is used by momentum transfer collisions\nwhich results in a thermal spike. Davis11 and Robertson12\nmodified calculations of Windischmann13 by allowing im-\nplanted carbon atoms to relax to the film surface, due to the\nhigh localized temperature generated by the impinging C1\nions in the thermal spike. Yet, questions as to the validity of\na thermal spike at ion energies of a few hundred electron\nvolts in a low elemental mass material remains unanswered.\nNevertheless, at such impact energies several thousand vibra-\ntions are involved for a time period of the order of 10212 s.14\na!Present address: SAP AG Postfach 1461, D-69185 Walldorf, Germany;\nauthor to whom all correspondence should be addressed.6024 J.

Redistribution subject to AIP lDense and highly tetrahedral amorphous carbon films\nhave also been deposited by the laser ablation technique,15,16\nby dual ion beam technique,17 and recently by magnetron\nsputtering together with intense ion plating ~MS\/IP!.18,19 This\nMS\/IP technique differs from other techniques since the film\nforming particles are low energy neutral carbon atoms ~sput-\ntered from a graphite target!, and the necessary energy for\ndensification of the film is transferred by the argon ion\nplating process.\nIn this article evidence as to the influence of stress on the\ndeposition of highly tetrahedral amorphous carbon ~ta\u2013C!\nfilms by MS\/IP is discussed using new experimental results.\nThe relaxation or migration of implanted carbon atoms to the\nfilm surface at high plating energies is shown not necessarily\nto be due to a thermal spike @of Seitz and Koehler ~Ref. 20!#,\nbut more likely to the enhanced mobility of carbon atoms\nbelow the surface resulting from the momentum transfer due\nto the intense ion bombardment. Further, the article shows\nfor the first time evidence for the existence of ordered re-\ngions with interplanar spacings corresponding to graphite\neven when the bulk density of the films are much higher than\nthat of graphite. These regions explain the different elec-\ntronic properties of the ta\u2013C films prepared by MS\/IP com-\npared to ta\u2013C films prepared by FCVA. Further, we show\nthat there is no straightforward relationship between the sp2\ncontent and the optical and electronic properties of the amor-\nphous carbon films. We show that beside the sp2 content, the\ndistribution and local bonding of the sp2 sites must play a\nsignificant role in the electronic and optical properties of\na-C and a-C:H.\nEXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nUsing MS\/IP technique a graphite target is sputtered by\nAr ions which derive from the plasma torus in front of the\ntarget.18 In our experiment, the neutral sputtered carbon at-7\/82(12)\/6024\/7\/$10.00 \u00a9 1997 American Institute of Physics\nicense or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/about\/rights_and_permissions\nDownoms are deposited on crystalline silicon substrates and are hit\nby argon ions originating from the substrate side of the\nplasma. As a result of the Ar1 collisions, the carbon atoms at\nthe surface of the film are forced into the film. Amorphous\ncarbon films have been deposited by unbalanced magnetrons\nusing the dc- and rf-mode. In the dc-mode the unbalanced\nmagnetron works at power levels between 20 and 200 W. In\nthis study the magnetron operates in the rf-mode at an Ar\npressure of 1.531023 mbar, a rf power of 200 W with a\nrf-frequency of 13.56 MHz. The target to substrate distance\nis 6 cm for both magnetrons. Using the magnetron working\nin the rf mode the energy of the plating Ar ions is varied by\napplying an additional bias to the substrate from 25 ~plasma\npotential! to 150 eV. The experiments for the rf unbalanced\nmagnetron have been carried out at different ratios of Ar ion\nflux, f i , to carbon atom flux, fn , here especially for\nf i \/fn53 and 8. The stress of the deposited films have been\nmeasured by the bending beam method using Stoney\u2019s equa-\ntion.\nThe film density values have been derived from the plas-\nmon energy obtained from electron energy loss spectroscopy\n~EELS! and by Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy\n~RBS!. Further density measurements of the carbon films\nprepared with the dc magnetron have been performed by a\nfloating method, where the films were placed in a solution\nwhich had a graded density. In addition, the density has also\nbeen determined by a weighing method which measured the\nmass and the volume of the film. It should be noted that\nEELS is a measure for the electron density.\nElectron spin resonance ~ESR! measurements have been\nperformed at a microwave frequency of ;9.3 GHz using a\nmicrowave power of 25 mW in order to avoid saturation\neffects. Only for the samples showing a very low spin den-\nsity was a microwave power of 0.25 mW chosen. The ESR\nmeasurements were carried out at room temperature at a\nmodulation amplitude of 0.9 Gauss with a modulation fre-\nquency of 100 kHz. The spin densities of the films have been\ndetermined by comparison to a standard ~DPPH!.\nFurther measurements have been performed using trans-\nmission electron microscopy ~TEM! at an accelerating volt-\nage of 200 kV.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nAn unbalanced dc magnetron has been used to deposit\na-C films at rather low argon plating energies and different\nflux ratios f i \/fn ~Fig. 1!. The carbon film densities of Fig. 1\nhave been measured by different methods. The difference\nbetween the densities as measured by the weighing method\nand densities determined by EELS ~or floating method! can\nbe understood if the microstructure of the carbon film is con-\nsidered. The weighing method is performed by weighing the\nmass and measuring the volume from the thickness, and area\nof the deposited carbon film. Therefore, microvoids may\ncontribute significantly to the volume of the film. The densi-\nties of the carbon films as determined by the floating method\nand EELS measurement remains approximately constant at a\nvalue of 2.1 g\/cm3. Both methods do not depend strongly on\nmicrovoids in the films as in case of the weighing method.J. Appl. Phys., Vol. 82, No. 12, 15 December 1997\nloaded 01 Oct 2010 to 131.227.178.158. Redistribution subject to AIP lThus, the density as determined by EELS is a measure of\nthe density of the local bonding structure ~we refer to the\ndensity measured by the EELS method as microdensity!,\nwhereas, the density as determined by the weighing method\nis a macro~scopic! density. This means that the density re-\nsults can be explained by a carbon structure with a density\nclose to graphite ~around 2.2 g\/cm3! but containing micro-\nvoids. From Fig. 1, one possible conclusion that can be\ndrawn is that most microvoids are essentially compressed in\na carbon matrix deposited at plating energies .7 eV and flux\nratios .2. These findings are in agreement with theoretical\npredictions of Muller.21\nIn this article we describe experiments pertaining to the\ndeposition of amorphous carbon films using an unbalanced\nmagnetron working in the rf mode and with rather high\nf i \/fn ratios. EELS measurements have been performed to\ndetermine the microdensity of the carbon films for flux ratios\nof 3, 5, 8, and 10 and have been confirmed by RBS. The\nenergy dependence of the microdensity for the flux ratios of\n5 and 10 was published elsewhere.18 The results show that\nfor flux ratios of 5, 8, and 10 a maximum in the microdensity\nis found. For a flux ratio of three no significant densification\nof the carbon films can be observed as a function of the ion\nplating energy. The microdensity of these films remain con-\nstant at a value of 2.1 g\/cm3 ~Fig. 2!. For a f i \/fn ratio of 10,\na maximum density of 3.1 g\/cm3 and sp3 content of 87% has\nbeen recorded for an Ar energy of 90 eV ~K-edge EELS\nspectra are shown in Fig. 3!. For a f i \/fn ratio of 8 the peak\nvalues of density amount to 2.6 g\/cm3 at an Ar energy of 98\neV. For a f i \/fn ratio of 5 the peak values of density and\nsp3 amount to 2.6 g\/cm3 and 60% at an Ar energy of 105 eV.\nThe densities calculated by EELS show a similar behavior to\nthe densities determined by RBS @they also reveal maxima in\nthe density at ion energies of 90 eV ~for f i \/fn ratio of 10!,\n98 eV ~f i \/fn ratio of 8! and 105 eV ~f i \/fn ratio of 5!#.\nFIG. 1. Density of carbon films deposited by a dc unbalanced magnetron.\nThe Ar plating energy has been varied by changing the dc power ~from 200\ndown to 20 W! and pressure in the deposition chamber ~from 331022 to\n231023 mbar!. The density of the films has been measured by three differ-\nent methods, ~j! density measured by a weighing method, ~s! density\nmeasured by a floating method, ~n! density derived from the EELS plasmon\nenergy.

This is not surprising\nbecause the depth resolution of RBS at a depth of 1000 \u00c5 is\nabout 200 \u00c5 due to multiple scattering of the ions ~electronic\nstopping!. Thus, it is expected that densities calculated from\nRBS-data have higher density values compared to densities\ncalculated from EELS-data.\nFor completeness we present the microdensity depen-\ndence on stress for films deposited at flux ratios f i \/fn of 3,\n5, 8, and 10 ~Fig. 4! although some of the data have already\nbeen published.18 Since only the microdensity is measured, it\nis still possible that the macrodensity too increases over the\nentire range presented. But, it should be noted from the re-\nsults shown in Fig. 1 that in the case of the dc magnetron, for\nplating energies above 7 eV, and flux ratios of 2, the mi-\ncrodensity and density ~measured by other methods! con-\nverge to similar values such that the density shown ~derived\nfrom EELS! is a good measure for the real density of the\ncarbon films. In Fig. 4 we see a marked increase in density\nabove a compressive stress of 13 GPa, which indicates the\nexistence of a stress threshold for the formation of a highly\ndense carbon structure such as those found with high sp3\nFIG. 2.

Figure 4 also indicates that for the formation of\ndense amorphous carbon films by MS\/IP high flux ratios are\nrequired. The stress threshold of 13 GPa can be compared to\nthe pressure values found by Erskine et al.,22 Yagi et al.,23\nTakano et al.,24 and Endo et al.25 for transitions from graph-\nite to a denser form of carbon. Below the stress transition\nvalue, the films have a density close to that of graphite and\nthe other physical properties such as optical band gap are\ngraphitelike.18 These can be compared to values normally\nfound for magnetron sputtered carbon films.26 The carbon\nfilms with the highest density (3.1 g\/cm3) has the highest\nsp3 content ~87%! and an optical gap of 1 eV. This very low\nvalue for the optical gap is not consistent with that for ta\u2013C\nfilms ~up to 2 eV! with comparable sp3 contents prepared by\nthe filtered cathodic vacuum arc,2 but, shows similarities to\ndata of Ishikawa et al.27 for C2 ion deposition of highly\nta\u2013C films. In Fig. 5 we present experimental data indicating\nthat no inconsistency exists between the low optical gap of 1\neV and high sp3 content of 87%, by showing that a relation-\nship does not exist between the sp2 content and the optical\nband gap in a \u2013C and a \u2013C:H films.

Be-\nside the sp2 content the distribution and local bonding of the\nsp2 bonds also plays a significant role in the electronic prop-\nerties of the amorphous ~hydrogenated! carbon films.\nThe stress and the microdensity are also not linearly\ncoupled to each other in the case of indirect subplantation;\nwhich is different for the case of direct C1 implantation.12\nThe inefficiency for the densification process and the cre-\nation of high stresses due to knock on effects will now be\ndiscussed in more detail. In the case of knock on processes,\nthe formation of an interstitial in a subsurface layer is accom-\npanied by the generation of a vacancy at the surface due to\nthe argon bombardment. The interstitial leads to an increase\nin densification and stress in the subsurface while the va-\ncancy at the surface leads to a reduction in density at the\nsurface. The results presented show that the microdensity\nremains constant at '2.1 g\/cm3 while the compressive stress\nin the films remains below 13 GPa. Despite the stress in-\ncreasing with increasing argon ion energy ~up to 100 eV!, the\nnonvariance of the density indicates that the implanted\n~knocked on! carbon is not trapped in the carbon film as a\ndensity increasing interstitial. Due to the low energy in-\nvolved in the knock on process, the interstitial is created near\nthe vacancy close to the surface. This vacancy does not exist\nin the direct subplantation process. In the indirect subplanta-\ntion process the implanted carbon can more easily migrate to\nthe surface due to the close proximity of the missing carbon\nat the surface. This relaxation process leads to the compara-\ntively higher inefficiency of densification compared to the\ndirect subplantation process. Yet, the migration of the sub-\nsurface interstitial to the surface does not necessarily mean\nthat the stress in the film is relieved. The stress is likely to\nremain in the surrounding matrix although the cause of the\nstress has now been removed. Thus, high stresses can be\ncreated with no apparent densification. Up to 13 GPa, relax-\nation processes like the one described above dominate. As\nthe stress exceeds the threshold of 13 GPa the sp2!sp3\ntransformation takes place.\nFor all F i \/Fn ratios, the stress versus ion energy curves\nshow distinct maxima depending on both, the ion energy and\nf i \/fn values ~Fig. 6!. Based on calculations of Sigmund,33\nWindischmann,13 Seitz and Koehler,20 and Davis11 found\nthat the stress, s, varies as a function of the ion energy as\nfollows:\ns}\nE1\/2\nRFn \/F i1k3E5\/3\n, ~1!\nwhere F i equals the ion flux, Fn is the total flux per unit\narea with which atoms contribute to the growing film, R and\nk are constants which depend on the density and the activa-\ntion energy for the relaxation process. This analytical expres-\nsion was derived for films deposited at low ion plating ener-\ngies ~0\u2013150 eV!.\nIt has already been shown that the plating Ar1 does not\ndensify the carbon film as efficiently as an implanted C1\nion.18 This implies that the excess energy in the case of argon\nion plating must be higher than in the case of direct carbon\nion implantation, because a stronger migration of implanted\ncarbon to the surface takes place. This also indicates that theJ. Appl. Phys., Vol. 82, No. 12, 15 December 1997\nloaded 01 Oct 2010 to 131.227.178.158.

This means that the relaxation\nin the case of the indirect subplantation process is not due to\na thermal spike as discussed by Seitz and Koehler,20 but\nanother relaxation\/migration or diffusion process due to the\nenhanced mobility of the carbon atoms resulting from the\nintense ion bombardment. It is emphasized that the value x\n54.5 is an empirical value and is not derived for a special\nrelaxation or migration process.

In both cases the\ndensification leads to higher concentrations of sp3 bonds.\nA possible explanation for the E4.5 dependence could be\nas follows: When an argon ion hits the surface, it transfers its\nkinetic energy to the carbon atoms close to the surface. If we\nassume that only carbon atoms, which were knocked by the\nargon, can move to the surface ~radiation enhanced\ndiffusion5,6!, it is possible to estimate the relaxation of the\ncarbon atoms to the surface as a function of argon ion en-\nergy. We assume that only those carbon atoms contained\nwithin the volume V , the volume in which an energetic Ar\nion loses all its energy ~thus having no further energy for\ndisplacement processes!, contribute to the migration process.\nThe volume V may be estimated using a TRIM cascade\nalgorithm,36 although strictly speaking the ion energies are\ntoo low to give accurate results. TRIM reveals the average\nlateral straggle DR of the argon atoms as well as the pen-\netration range R of the argon ions. Thus, the volume V can\nbe estimated as V54\/3pR(DR)2. An ellipsoid volume has\nbeen used because the dissipation distribution of the impact\nenergy is symmetric in rotation ~thus V}DR2! having a\nGaussian shape at a penetration depth R . The dependence of\nV up to an argon ion plating energy of 130 eV is presented in\nFig. 5 showing a power law dependence of V vs E4. This is\nclose to the value of 4.5 found from our experimental results.\nStill those TRIM calculations have to be confirmed by mo-\nlecular dynamic calculations. Nevertheless, this would mean\nthat the relaxation is given by the knock on dynamics and\nenergy transfers of the argon ion to the surrounding carbon\natoms. Thus, the carbon atoms gain enough energy for a\n\u2018\u2018radiation enhanced diffusion\u2019\u2019 as predicted by Lifshitz.6\nFrom the deposition rate, the density and the ion flux, the\nresputter yield of carbon can be calculated from the experi-\nmental data ~assuming for an Ar ion plating energy of 25 eV\nno carbon is resputtered and so the neutral carbon flux Fn is\ngiven!.

If preferential sputtering was the\ndominant deposition mechanism for the formation of sp3\nbonds all films deposited at high energies should have high\nsp3 contents and consequently high compressive stresses.\nBut, it is clearly seen that the sp3 content and stress both\npeak at an energy window in the mid-energy region ~about\n100 eV! depending on the flux for MS\/IP films. Therefore,\npreferential sputtering in the case of intense ion plating is not\nresponsible for the formation of the sp3 rich films. This leads\nto the conclusion that in our case, preferential sputtering has\nonly a weak influence on the deposition mechanism.\nTo get more information about the microstructure of the\na-C films Raman and ESR measurements have been per-\nformed. The spin density dependence on Ar ion plating en-\nergy for F i \/Fn53 is shown in Fig. 9. For a plating energy\nFIG. 8. Resputter yield of carbon vs argon ion plating energy. This figure\nalso shows that the preferential etching only plays a minor role for the\ncreation of sp3.\nFIG. 9. Spin density vs Argon plating energy for a-C films deposited with\nthe unbalanced rf magnetron at a flux ratio of 3. Further, only for a flux ratio\nof 5 the spin density could be measured ~Ref. 18! because for the films\ndeposited at higher flux ratios the ESR signal was too low.Schwan et al.\nicense or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/about\/rights_and_permissions\nDownof 25 eV the carbon film has a typical defect density of 5\n31020 spins\/cm3. With increasing plating energy, there is a\nsharp drop in defect density down to 1018 spins\/cm3. The\nRaman spectra of these films as well as for the amorphous\ncarbon films deposited at higher flux ratios are similar to\nRaman spectra of highly disordered graphitic structures.38\nThis is surprising for carbon films containing more than 60%\nsp3, but it should be noted that the Raman sensivity of dia-\nmond is 503 less than that for graphite.39 In order to obtain\nmore information on the microstructure of these films a TEM\nanalysis was performed.\nSelected area diffraction was performed using the small-\nest available aperture. This gave an illuminated region of\nabout 100 nm in diameter.

The\ninsert in Fig. 10~a! shows a region of the deposited film at\nhigher magnification. The image is taken at the Scherzer de-\nfocus condition. At the higher magnification, stacks of par-\nallel fringes can be seen having spacings close to 3.26 \u00c5.\nThis corresponds to the 002 lattice spacing in graphite.

Redistribution subject to AIP lbright spots can be seen corresponding to the diffraction pat-\ntern expected from ~002! oriented graphite. This agrees with\nmeasurements of McCulloch et al.40 No spots can be ob-\nserved at the ~004! position. The preferentially aligned ~002!\nplanes of graphite alludes to the models recently proposed\nfor a-C films by McCulloch et al.40 and McKenzie.3 Al-\nthough TEM showed that most of the carbon film is amor-\nphous such regions in the carbon films may be responsible\nfor the low optical gap and observed Raman scattering.38 The\nrather broad G-line width of the Raman data may be due to\nthe high compressive stress in the films.38 These findings\nmay also explain the ESR results presented. At low plating\nenergy and at low flux ratios, 1020 defects\/cm3 have been\nmeasured. With increasing plating energy and flux ratio, the\np defect centers combine to form saturated p bonds which\nare not observed as paramagnetic centers by ESR.\nSUMMARY\nFrom the measurements presented it can be concluded\nthat the dominant densification process in films deposited by\nmagnetron sputtering and ion plating is a stress induced\ntransformation process from sp2 carbon to sp3. The creation\nof high stress in the films is explained by recoil implantation\nand relaxation processes due to the intense Ar1 bombard-\nment during film deposition. Preferential sputtering has only\na minor influence on the creation of sp3 sites. Further, it is\nshown empirically that the relaxation process is unlikely to\nbe due to a thermal spike. From the measurements presented\nit can be concluded that ion bombardment creates an en-\nhanced mobility of carbon atoms, below, but close to the\nsurface which leads to a migration of ~entrapped recoil! car-\nbon atoms to the surface of the film. The presented results\nindicate that a more general model is needed to explain the\nstress ~or density! behavior of carbon films with energy.\nSuch a model must take the different diffusion and migration\nprocesses into account ~e.g., surface diffusion, radiation en-\nhanced diffusion, and volume diffusion!.\nEven for films with a high sp3 content, deposited at\nintense ion flux ratios and Ar ion energies of 90 eV, there is\nevidence that graphitic regions exist. We propose that in cer-\ntain localized regions the stress is not sufficiently high to\ntransform graphitic regions to sp3 bonds. If the stress ex-\nceeds a certain threshold, ~about 13 GPa! sp3 rich regions\nare formed. This means that for the films analyzed in this\nstudy, graphitic regions may be the precursor needed for the\nformation of sp3 rich films under high compressive stress.\nThe presented results in this article are evidence that the\nsp2 content alone does not control the electronic properties\nof amorphous ~hydrogenated! carbon films. It has to be con-\nsidered that the local bonding structure of sp2 carbon ~e.g.,\naromatic, conjugated or olefinic! also plays ~beside the sp2\ncontent itself! a significant role in the electronic properties of\nthe films.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was sponsored by the DFG Project No. Eh23\/\n29-1.
