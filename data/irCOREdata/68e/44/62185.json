The results for the three soils were 16 \nquantitatively similar.  Comparison of the titration data with previously published results 17 \nfor humic acids isolated from the same soils showed the soil organic matter to have a 18 \ngreater ionic strength dependency of proton binding and to possess relatively greater 19 \nbuffering capacity at high pH, attributable to weak acid groups (c. 2 - 5 mmol g-1) in the 20 \nhumin fraction of the soils.  To describe the soil titration data quantitatively, we modified 21 \nHumic Ion-Binding Model VI-FD, which utilises a fixed Donnan volume to describe 22 \ncounterion accumulation, by increasing the content of weak acid groups.  When artefacts in 23 \npH measurement due to the suspension effect were taken into account, the resulting Model 24 \nVI-FD2 provided good or fair simulations of all the titration data.  The results suggest that 25 \nsoil structure, specifically aggregation, plays a significant role in cation binding by organic 26 \nsoils in situ.  The lack of dependence of the titration results on soil suspension 27 \nconcentration suggests that the findings can be applied to soils in situ. 28 \n  29 \n EJSS-026-08 REVISION \n3 \nIntroduction 30 \nThe binding of protons and other cations by organic matter is of interest for a variety of 31 \nreasons, including pH buffering, metal binding and transport, and nutrient control. To 32 \npredict the cation binding reactions involved in these processes correctly, it is necessary to 33 \nhave an accurate description of the acid-base properties of soil organic matter (Tipping, 34 \n2002). Soil organic matter consists of a variety of entities, among which humic substances 35 \ndominate its cation binding properties. Two well-established models of cation binding by 36 \nhumic substances are Humic Ion-Binding Model VI (Tipping, 1998) and the 37 \nNICA-Donnan model (Kinniburgh et al., 1999).  These comprehensive models account for 38 \ntwo key characteristics of humic substances, namely the heterogeneity of the cation 39 \nbinding functional groups (carboxylic acids and weaker acid groups such as phenolic-OH) 40 \nand the ionic strength dependency of cation binding (arising from the electrostatic 41 \nproperties of humic molecules). 42 \nThe cation binding properties of humic substances isolated from soils under 43 \nwell-defined laboratory conditions are now relatively well understood. However, recent 44 \nresearch has highlighted the fact that isolated humic substances may not be a good 45 \nrepresentation of soil organic matter in terms of the ionic strength dependency of cation 46 \nbinding (Smith et al., 2004; Gustafsson & Berggren Kleja, 2005). Suspensions of unaltered 47 \nsoils can be used to study the acid-base properties of soil organic matter, but interpretation 48 \nof results is by no means straightforward. Uncertainties exist about (i) the dissolution of 49 \nmineral soil components when the pH is changed, and (ii) the original extent and 50 \nspeciation of metal binding in the soil. Instead, a number of authors have used suspensions 51 \nof peat, to minimise interference from mineral soil components, pre-treated by extensive 52 \nacid-washing, to replace bound metals with protons.  Smith et al. (2004) performed acid-53 \nbase titrations using acid-washed peat at concentrations of 10 \u2013 30 g l-1. When modelling 54 \n EJSS-026-08 REVISION \n4 \ntheir own data, and those of previous studies on acid-washed peat (Bloom & McBride, 55 \n1979; Marinsky et al., 1980), Smith et al. found that the ionic strength dependency of 56 \nproton binding was stronger than predicted by Model VI. To simulate the acid-washed peat 57 \nresults more accurately, the electrostatic submodel used in Model VI \u2013 based on a diffuse 58 \nelectrical layer surrounding an impermeable sphere \u2013 was replaced with one based on a 59 \nfixed Donnan volume. The revised model was called Model VI-FD (Smith et al., 2004). 60 \nIn a recent study by Cooke et al. (2007), acid-base titrations of an initially 61 \naggregated humic acid showed a diminishing dependence on ionic strength as the pH was 62 \nraised (i.e. as the aggregates dissolved), indicating that the ionic strength dependency is 63 \nrelated to the degree of aggregation. It was suggested that in humic aggregates the 64 \nelectrical layers of individual particles overlap to form a counter-ion accumulation zone 65 \nwhich varies little in volume with ionic strength, which would explain why an electrostatic 66 \nsubmodel based on a fixed Donnan volume provides a better description of the acid-base 67 \nproperties of acid-washed peat. 68 \nBased on the results of Smith et al. (2004), it can be assumed that the acid-base 69 \nproperties of the soil organic matter in peat are different to those of isolated humic 70 \nsubstances. However, Smith et al. provided no direct comparisons between peat and 71 \nisolated humic substances, and the experiments were performed over a limited pH range 72 \n(2.4 \u2013 5.5).  In the work reported here, we investigated the proton binding properties of 73 \nacid-washed organic soils in more detail.  We carried out potentiometric titrations over 74 \nwide ranges of pH and at different ionic strengths on acid-washed preparations of three 75 \ndifferent organic soil types, and compared the results to those already reported for humic 76 \nacids isolated from the same soils (Cooke et al., 2007).   We determined the concentration-77 \ndependence of titration behaviour, in order to investigate (a) the effects of possible 78 \nvariations in the state of aggregation of the organic matter, and (b) the reliability of 79 \n EJSS-026-08 REVISION \n5 \nextrapolation to field conditions.  We interpreted our results with Humic Ion-Binding 80 \nModel VI-FD, and modified the model to account for the new information.  81 \n 82 \n 83 \nMaterials and methods 84 \nSamples of organic-rich soil horizons (Ranker, Podzol, Peat) were collected from three 85 \ncontrasting temperate-region soils.  The Ranker sample was from the A-horizon of a humic 86 \nranker (FAO Histic Leptosol) under mat grass (Nardus stricta) in the Duddon Valley, Lake 87 \nDistrict, UK (54\u00b041' N, 03\u00b014' W).  The Podzol sample was from the OH-horizon of a 88 \nCambic Podzol (FAO) under Norway spruce (Picea abies), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) 89 \nand birch (Betula pubescens) at Birkenes, Southern Norway (58\u00b022' N, 08\u00b013' E).  The 90 \nPeat sample (FAO Dystric Histosol) was from the surface of  blanket peat under sphagnum 91 \nmoss (Sphagnum spp.), heather (Calluna vulgaris) and cotton grass (Eriophorum spp.) at 92 \nMoor House, North Pennines, UK (54\u00b068' N, 02\u00b038' W); the degree of humification was 5 93 \non the von Post scale.  Each sample was sieved (10 mm mesh) to remove stones and roots 94 \nand stored in a refrigerator. 95 \nThe soils were acid-washed following the method of Smith et al. (2004) as follows. 96 \nSub-samples were suspended in deionised water and adjusted to pH 1 with concentrated 97 \nHNO3. The samples were shaken for c. 1 min and then left in the dark at room temperature 98 \nfor at least 16 hours, allowing the suspended particles to settle out. Supernatants were 99 \nremoved using a peristaltic pump, the container refilled with deionised water and the 100 \nsolution returned to pH 1. The acid-washing procedure was repeated seven times. Samples 101 \nwere then subjected to exhaustive dialysis against deionised water using cellulose tubing 102 \nwith a molecular weight cut-off of 12,000 (Sigma D-9402). After dialysis, the acid-washed 103 \nsoils were stored as stock suspensions in a refrigerator. 104 \n EJSS-026-08 REVISION \n6 \nSoil analysis 105 \nThe organic matter content of the untreated soils was estimated by determining loss-on-106 \nignition of oven dried samples in a laboratory furnace (550\u00b0C for 2 hours). Samples of 107 \nacid-washed soil were analysed for total C and total N (Universal CHNS-O Vario EL 108 \nelemental analyser). The humic and fulvic acid contents of the acid-washed soils were 109 \ndetermined using a method based on that of Smith et al. (2004). To measure the degree to 110 \nwhich the acid-washing successfully removed metals from the soils, samples of untreated 111 \nsoil and acid-washed soil were extracted with 0.1 M HNO3 and metal concentrations 112 \ndetermined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (Perkin-Elmer Elan DRC 113 \nII). 114 \nTitrations 115 \nAcid-base titrations were carried out manually in continuous mode using a suspension 116 \nvolume of 500 cm3 in most cases, but 50 cm3 when high soil concentrations were 117 \nemployed.  Measurements of pH were made with a combination glass electrode and meter 118 \n(Radiometer GK2401C and PHM82) which underwent a regular quality control procedure 119 \n(Davison, 1990).  The manufacturer quotes a typical outflow rate of 10 \u03bcl h-1 for the 120 \nsaturated KCl solution used as the salt bridge of the electrode.  Performance of the 121 \nexperimental set-up was verified by carrying out acid-base titrations of KH2PO4. Acid-122 \nwashed soil titration solutions were prepared from stock suspensions by weighing out well-123 \nmixed aliquots.  Stock suspension concentrations were determined by drying triplicate 124 \naliquots to a constant weight at c. 110\u00b0C in a laboratory oven. Additional untreated soil 125 \ntitration solutions were prepared by weighing out moist soil directly. All titrations were 126 \ncarried out in a water bath at 10\u00b0C.  Soil titrations were performed at 2, 20 and 150 g l-1, 127 \nthe last of these concentrations being the highest practicably attainable.  During the 128 \n EJSS-026-08 REVISION \n7 \ntitrations labelled \u201c150 g l-1\u201d in the following account, the actual concentration fell to about 129 \n120 g l-1 due to dilution, but this was taken into account in calculations.  130 \nAll titrations were started from the initial low pH of the solution. Particulate 131 \nmaterial was kept in suspension by continual stirring with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirrer 132 \nbar. Titrations were performed at four initial background electrolyte concentrations; 133 \n0.3, 3, 30 and 300 mM NaNO3.  In model applications, account was taken of the presence 134 \nin the suspension of KCl that had leaked from the pH electrode.  The KCl concentration 135 \ndue to leakage typically reached 0.7 mM by the end of titrations with a volume of 500 cm3, 136 \nand 5 mM when a volume of 50 cm3 was used. 137 \nBecause of the surfactant properties of humic substances, the suspensions were not 138 \ndegassed during the titrations, but were bubbled with oxygen-free nitrogen for c. 5 min. 139 \nprior to the titrations and then kept under a nitrogen blanket. The nitrogen was passed 140 \nthrough 0.2 M NaOH, followed by deionised water, to ensure it was CO2-free and water-141 \nsaturated. The pH probe was calibrated immediately before and after each titration using 142 \npH 4, 7 and 10 IUPAC buffers, pre-equilibrated at 10\u00b0C. Any drift in response over the 143 \ncourse of a titration was taken into consideration in the calculation of pH by linear 144 \ninterpolation. 145 \nApproximately 0.5 M carbonate-free NaOH was prepared and standardised against 146 \nacid by Gran titration. The NaOH was dispensed from a calibrated auto-burette 147 \n(Radiometer ABU80) fitted with a trap containing Carbosorb, to minimise the sorption of 148 \nCO2 by the NaOH solution. Using a concentrated solution of base kept the volume change 149 \non addition of titrant to a minimum. Care was taken to ensure that the system had reached 150 \nequilibrium before measurements were taken and further titrant added. This was only done 151 \nwhen the drift on the electrode was less than 1 mV over a 10 min period (\u2248 0.002 152 \npH min-1). Titrations typically took between 7 and 12 hours to complete. The manual 153 \n EJSS-026-08 REVISION \n8 \nnature of the titrations and the care taken to ensure equilibrium resulted in approximately 154 \nsix data points for each titration. To increase the number of data points, independent repeat 155 \ntitrations were performed on the acid-washed soils at 20 g l-1 and various ionic strengths 156 \nwith different additions of base. This also served to confirm the reproducibility of the 157 \nexperimental results. The repeat titrations were performed once the first set of titrations 158 \nwere complete, so variability due to time-related factors (e.g. new batches of NaOH) were 159 \neffectively included. 160 \nCalculation of charge 161 \nCharge on the organic matter was calculated on the basis of charge balance (i.e. the total 162 \nsystem is electrically neutral).  Thus, the net charge in equivalents per gram of dry soil is 163 \ngiven by 164 \n  Z = ([NO3-] + [OH-] \u2013 [Na+] \u2013 [H+]) \/ [soil]    (1) 165 \nwhere square brackets indicate concentrations.  Concentrations of  H+ and OH- were 166 \ncalculated from their activities, using the Davies equation (with B = 0.2) to derive activity 167 \ncoefficients. The H+ activity was calculated from pH measurements, and the OH- activity 168 \nfrom the temperature-compensated ion product of water.  169 \n 170 \nSuspension effect experiment 171 \nThree Peat suspensions were prepared in duplicate, by adding the equivalent of 46 g dry 172 \nsolids per litre to 0.3 mM, 3mM and 100 mM NaNO3. The suspensions (350 cm3) were 173 \nstirred overnight and their pH values determined.  They were then centrifuged at 18 000 g 174 \nfor 3 hours, the supernatants were removed and their pH values measured.  The centrifuge 175 \npellets and supernatants were recombined to check that no change in pH had occurred as a 176 \nresult of the centrifugation.  The degree of dispersion of the solid material, which includes 177 \nboth dissolved and colloidal suspended organic matter, was determined by drying the 178 \n EJSS-026-08 REVISION \n9 \nsupernatants from separate experiments and weighing the solid residue, correcting for the 179 \npresence of added salt. 180 \n 181 \nIon-binding models 182 \nHumic Ion-Binding Model VI has been described in full elsewhere (Tipping, 1998). In 183 \nbrief, it is a discrete site model in which binding is modified by electrostatic interactions. 184 \nThe model contains eight functional groups of different acid strengths, each characterised 185 \nby an intrinsic equilibrium constant (proton binding with no electrostatic effects), the 186 \nnegative logarithms of which are denoted pK1 \u2013 pK8. The four most acidic groups are 187 \nreferred to as type A and represent mainly carboxylic acid groups, while the remaining 188 \nfour groups are referred to as type B and represent weaker acids, such as phenolic groups. 189 \nThe eight groups are described by four constants; pKA and pKB define the mean intrinsic 190 \npK values of the type A and type B groups respectively, while \u0394pKA and \u0394pKB define the 191 \n(uniform) spread of the pK values around the means. The \u0394pK values, in a simple way, 192 \nrepresent the chemical heterogeneity of the humic material. The total number of type A 193 \ngroups is given by nA. On the basis of published data for isolated humic substances, and to 194 \navoid over-parameterisation, the total number of type B groups is fixed at nA \/ 2.  The 195 \nimposed regularity of the groups facilitates the formation of multi-dentate binding sites for 196 \nmetals, however, this does not affect the description of proton binding as it is exclusively 197 \nmonodentate.  Table 1 shows the default parameters of Model VI. 198 \nIn Model VI, the effect of electrostatic interactions are accounted for by treating the 199 \nmolecules as impermeable spheres, each surrounded by a diffuse layer of counter-ions. The 200 \nintrinsic equilibrium constants of binding sites are modified with an empirical term that is 201 \ndependent on ionic strength, I.  The Donnan expression is then used to calculate counter-202 \n EJSS-026-08 REVISION \n10 \nion accumulation within a zone around each molecule. The size of the counter-ion 203 \naccumulation zone is partly determined by the diffuse layer thickness, which is taken to be 204 \nthe reciprocal of the Debye-H\u00fcckel parameter, \u03ba. As \u03ba is proportional to I\u00bd, the diffuse 205 \nlayer thickness is inversely related to ionic strength. For aqueous solutions at 25\u00b0C, 1 \/ \u03ba \u2248 206 \n10-8 m at I = 0.001 M, and 1 \/ \u03ba \u2248 10-9 m at I = 0.1 M (Tipping, 2002). When this 207 \nelectrostatic submodel is applied to soils in situ, the concentration of humic substances can 208 \nbe such that the theoretical volume of the diffuse layer becomes impossibly large. Model 209 \nVI gets round this problem by restricting the diffuse layer volume to 25% of the total 210 \nvolume of water in the system. 211 \nIn  soils in situ, and in suspensions, the humic matter is obviously highly 212 \naggregated. In Model VI-FD (Smith et al., 2004), these aggregates are treated as basic 213 \nunits. The electrostatic submodel of Model VI is replaced by one based on an aggregate of 214 \nimpermeable spheres, surrounded by a fixed Donnan volume in which counter-ions can 215 \naccumulate. Electrostatic effects are accounted for with an unadjusted Donnan formulation. 216 \nBinding or dissociation reactions within a Donnan phase are described by conventional 217 \nequilibrium expressions (Tipping, 2002). Thus, for the binding of a proton or metal cation 218 \nby a humic compound: 219 \nzZzZ +=+ RMMR       (2) 220 \nwhere R is the humic compound of charge Z (invariably negative) and M is the cation of 221 \ncharge z, the equilibrium constant for the reaction in the Donnan volume, KD, is 222 \nDD\nD\nD ]M[]R[\n]RM[\nzZ\nzZ\nK\n+\n=       (3) 223 \nwhere [RMZ+z]D, [RZ]D and [Mz]D are the reactant concentrations in the Donnan volume. 224 \nThe concentration of a cation in the Donnan volume is related to its concentration in the 225 \nbulk solution by the Boltzmann law 226 \n EJSS-026-08 REVISION \n11 \n\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\u2212=\nkT\nzezz D\nD exp]M[]M[\n\u03c8\n     (4) 227 \nwhere \u03a8D is the Donnan potential, k is Boltzmann\u2019s constant, T is the absolute temperature 228 \nand e is the charge on a single ion (1.6 \u00d7 10-19 C).

If VD is 233 \nknown or assumed, and the values of [Mz] are known, the values of [Mz]D and \u03a8D can be 234 \ncalculated. 235 \nThe Boltzmann term, exp(-\u03b5\u03a8D \/ kT), can be eliminated from equation (4) to give 236 \n\u039a=\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b=\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b=\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b 3\n1\n3\n3\nD\n3\n3\n2\n1\n2\n2\nD\n2\n2\n1\n1\n1\n1\nD\n1\n1\n]M[\n]M[\n]M[\n]M[\n]M[\n]M[ z\nz\nzz\nz\nzz\nz\nz\n   (6) 237 \nwhere z1, z2, z3 etc. are the charges borne by the different cations, so that it is not 238 \nnecessary to know or derive \u03a8D in order to solve the equations for species distributions. 239 \nEquation (6) shows that the ratio of the cation concentration in the Donnan volume to that 240 \nin the bulk solution depends only upon its charge (in the absence of selectivity). 241 \nIf it is assumed that the Donnan volume is fixed (i.e. it does not vary with ionic 242 \nstrength) the apparent pK values of humic binding sites, calculated from bulk solution pH, 243 \nvary by approximately one log unit per tenfold change in ionic strength \u2013 except when the 244 \ndegree of humic dissociation is low (Tipping, 2002). Thus, if the ionic strength of a humic 245 \nsolution is increased from 0.01 to 0.1 M, the bulk solution pH would decrease by c. 1 pH 246 \nunit. 247 \n 248 \nSuspension effect correction 249 \n EJSS-026-08 REVISION \n12 \nThe measurement of proton binding in concentrated suspensions at low ionic strength will 250 \nbe subject to artefacts due to the \u201csuspension effect of the first kind\u201d as defined by Oman 251 \net al. (2007).  This arises because the ion-sensitive probe (the glass electrode in this case) 252 \nexperiences counterions associated with particulate and colloidal material as well as those 253 \nin the bulk solution.  The effect increases with suspension concentration but decreases with 254 \nionic strength, as the H+ concentration difference between the diffuse layer and bulk 255 \nsolution decreases.  When using Model VI-FD alone, we estimated the magnitude of the 256 \nsuspension effect using the equation 257 \n[H+]app = \u03b1SE VD[soil] [H+]D  +  (1 \u2013 VD[soil]) [H+]   (7) 258 \nHere [H+]app is the hydrogen ion concentration experienced by the probe, [H+]D refers to 259 \nthe Donnan volume, and [H+] to the bulk solution.  The term VD[soil] is the fraction of the 260 \ntotal liquid volume due to the Donnan volume.  The parameter \u03b1SE is the fraction of the 261 \ncounterion H+ experienced by the probe, and lies between zero and unity.   262 \n Calculations for systems that contained both aggregated and dispersed soil 263 \nemployed both Model VI-FD and the standard Model VI.  In these circumstances, the 264 \nDonnan volume of the aggregates and the diffuse volumes of the dispersed humic and 265 \nfulvic acids were combined to estimate the total volume containing counterions, and the 266 \naverage H+ concentration in this volume was used to quantify the suspension effect.  267 \n 268 \n 269 \nResults  270 \nTable 2 shows the results of the soil analysis.  The Peat is almost entirely composed of 271 \norganic matter, while the Ranker and Podzol each contain about 30% mineral matter.  272 \nGiven the high functional group content of natural organic matter, it was expected that the 273 \nproton binding properties of all three soils would be dominated by the organic matter.  The 274 \n EJSS-026-08 REVISION \n13 \nvalues for total C, humic acid C and fulvic acid C, along with the organic matter estimates, 275 \nhighlight the fact that the majority of organic matter in these soils is not extractable humic 276 \nor fulvic acids, but material with insufficient ionisable groups to be rendered soluble by the 277 \nhigh concentrations of base used in the humic substances extraction.  The proportions of 278 \nhumic and fulvic acids for the three soils are similar to previous results obtained by the 279 \nsame procedure (Tipping et al., 1995; Smith et al., 2004).  The acid washing brought about 280 \nsubstantial decreases in Al, Ni and Cd and more modest changes in Fe, Cu and Pb.  It can 281 \nbe assumed that the weakly-binding base cationic metals (Na, Mg, K, Ca) were effectively 282 \nremoved. 283 \nTitration results for acid-washed soils  284 \nExperimental results for titrations of acid-washed Ranker, Peat and Podzol samples, at 285 \n20 g l-1 and four different concentrations of background electrolyte, are shown by the 286 \npoints in Figure 1. Results for all three soils are alike; the titration curves exhibit a similar 287 \nshape and spacing in each case. This indicates that the organic matter in each of these soils 288 \nhas comparable acid-base properties, and thus a similar distribution of acidic functional 289 \ngroups and a similar ionic strength dependency of proton binding. The Podzol and Peat 290 \nsamples have nearly identical buffering capacity over the range titrated, while the buffering 291 \ncapacity of the Ranker sample is slightly less (the titration curves are steeper), indicating 292 \nthat the Ranker possesses fewer acidic functional groups than the other samples. 293 \nFigure 2 compares the calculated net charge on the acid-washed soils (Figure 2a-c) 294 \nwith the net charge on the humic acids isolated from the same soils (Figure 2d-f), taken 295 \nfrom the results of Cooke et al. (2007), at the same four concentrations of background 296 \nelectrolyte.  A precise comparison of the two sets of results is not possible because the 297 \nisolated humic acids have higher contents (mol g-1) of ionisable groups than the soils, but 298 \nfor our present purposes it is sufficient to adjust the charge scales so that the titration plots 299 \n EJSS-026-08 REVISION \n14 \nat acid pH appear similar.  There are two major differences  between the acid-washed soils 300 \nand the humic isolates.  Firstly, the soils have steeper charge curves at high pH, indicating 301 \nhigher contents of weak acid groups (greater site densities).  Secondly, proton binding by 302 \nthe soils displays a greater dependence on ionic strength, as shown by the greater spacing 303 \nof the charge curves.    304 \nWe checked that the differences between acid-washed soil and humic acid were 305 \nrelevant to the field situation, i.e. that the properties of the former were not artefacts of the 306 \nacid washing procedure, by performing additional experiments with an untreated Peat  307 \nsample.  The titration results with untreated Peat were reasonably similar to those for acid-308 \nwashed material (data not shown).  In particular, the ionic strength dependence of proton 309 \nbinding was the same, as judged by comparison of the titration results at low and high 310 \nionic strength.  Figure 3 shows the pH differences between titrations in 0.3 and 300 mM 311 \nNaNO3 for the untreated and acid-washed Peat samples to be essentially identical, and 312 \nmarkedly different from the differences for isolated humic acid. 313 \nThe data shown in Figures 1 and 2 were supplemented by the results of titrations 314 \ncarried out with different soil concentrations, 2 and 150 g l-1.  These results are presented 315 \nbelow. 316 \n 317 \nModelling  318 \nWe adapted Model VI-FD in the light of the evidence from Figure 2 that soil organic 319 \nmatter is relatively richer in weak acid groups than the corresponding humic acids.   The 320 \nsite density in the model was modified by increasing nB, the total number of type B groups 321 \nin humic acid.  The site contents of fulvic acid were maintained at the default values.  To 322 \nfit the experimental data, we maintained the default parameter values of Table 1, except 323 \nthat we optimised nB and pKB for humic acid.  The value of nB was constrained to bear a 324 \n EJSS-026-08 REVISION \n15 \nsimple relationship to nA in anticipation of the need to formulate a regular array of 325 \nmultidentate binding sites for metals; thus nB was allowed to be either 2nA or 4nA. The 326 \nvalues of pKB were adjusted because the additional weak acid sites might not have the 327 \nsame properties as those of humic acid.  To avoid over-fitting we did not optimise \u0394pKB as 328 \nwell, although this might also be done on the same grounds.  We also optimised fHS, the 329 \nfraction of the soil dry weight that is due to humic substances (humic and fulvic acids, in 330 \nthe proportions found by extraction; Table 2), and \u03b1SE, the parameter that corrects for the 331 \nsuspension effect (equation 7). 332 \nFirstly we used only Model VI-FD, i.e. we assumed that the Donnan volume 333 \nremains fixed over the entire range of experimental conditions, and does not change due to 334 \ndispersion at higher pH.  The root-mean-squared-deviation (RMSD) between observed and 335 \ncalculated pH was used as the criterion of fit.  Results for the Peat were best with nB = 2nA 336 \nand fHS in the range 0.28 \u2013 0.30, but a number of combinations of pKB (range 8.0 - 8.8) and 337 \n\u03b1SE (0.1 \u2013 0.5) were possible.  The same range of fHS applied to the Podzol, but the results 338 \ndepended less on nB (although a value of 4nA was slightly better), and again various 339 \ncombinations of pKB (8.0 - 8.8) and \u03b1SE (0.1 \u2013 0.5) gave good results.  The Ranker gave 340 \npoorer fits than the other two soils, but the parameters were better defined with fHS = 0.18 341 \nor 0.19, nB = 4nA and low values of pKB (8.0 \u2013 8.2), although the results were 342 \ncomparatively insensitive to \u03b1SE.  Given that the data do not provide unique parameter sets, 343 \nwe forced the values of  pKB and \u03b1SE to be the same for each soil sample, with values of 344 \n8.0 and 0.2 respectively.  Then the value of fHS was optimised with nB = 2nA for the Peat 345 \nand nB = 4nA for the Podzol and the Ranker.  The final results are shown in Table 3, and 346 \nthe fitted data in Figure 4.  We refer to this modified version of the model, i.e. with 347 \nadditional weak acid sites, as Model VI-FD2.  348 \n EJSS-026-08 REVISION \n16 \nThe possible effects of dispersion on the titration data were explored using a 349 \ncombination of Model VI-FD2 with the standard Model VI for the dispersed fraction.  The 350 \nextent of dispersion was approximated with the equation; 351 \nfraction dispersed = 10-\u03b2 pH\u03b2     (8) 352 \nThis causes the fraction dispersed to increase from zero to 1 in the pH range 0 to 10.  With 353 \n\u03b2 = 3, the fraction dispersed is 0.05 at pH 3.7, 0.2 at pH 5.8 and 0.5 at pH 7.9.  These 354 \nvalues are qualitatively consistent with the observed behaviour of soil organic matter 355 \nduring the extraction of humic substances by treatment with base, fulvic and humic acids 356 \nbeing brought into solution (or at least a finely divided colloidal state) at high pH, and 357 \nhumic acid being fully precipitated at low pH, and also with the progressive dispersion of 358 \nhumic matter with pH demonstrated by Tipping and Ohnstad (1984).  In the suspension 359 \neffect experiment (see Materials and methods), the dispersed fraction at the lowest ionic 360 \nstrength, with an observed supernatant pH of 3.99, was 0.01.  Therefore setting \u03b2 to 3 361 \noverestimates dispersion at acid pH, and the true dispersion behaviour of the system is 362 \nlikely to fall between the simulations for \u03b2 = \u221e (corresponding to the pure Model VI-FD2) 363 \nand \u03b2 = 3.  With \u03b2 = 0, the system is fully dispersed at all pH values.  Figure 5 shows 364 \nsimulated pH titrations for these three values of \u03b2.  There is hardly any difference between 365 \nthe results for \u03b2 = 3 and \u03b2 = \u221e, but full dispersion gives rise to quite different simulated 366 \ntitration behaviour at low pH, which agrees with the experimental findings of Cooke et al. 367 \n(2007). 368 \nThe parameterised model was used to simulate the results of an experiment with 369 \npeat to investigate the suspension effect (see Materials and methods).  In 0.3 mM NaNO3, 370 \nthe observed supernatant pH of 3.99 was 0.26 greater than the pH of the homogeneous 371 \nsuspension, while the calculated difference (with \u03b1SE = 0.2) was 0.42.  The corresponding 372 \ndifferences in 3 mM NaNO3 (observed supernatant pH = 3.76) were 0.14 (observed) and 373 \n EJSS-026-08 REVISION \n17 \n0.08 (calculated), while no difference was observed or calculated in 100 mM NaNO3 374 \n(observed supernatant pH = 3.11).  While the observations and model are not in full 375 \nagreement, these results support the assumption that the suspension effect is operating in 376 \nthese systems, and influencing observed electrode response. 377 \n 378 \n 379 \nDiscussion 380 \nAlthough the three soil samples are similar in their high contents of organic matter, they 381 \ndiffer in their circumstances of formation.  Therefore the very similar titration behaviours 382 \nsuggest that the results obtained in this work can be taken as representative, at least of 383 \ntemperate soil organic matter.  Moreover, the similar ionic strength dependences of the 384 \nacid washed Peat and the untreated material support the assumption that results obtained 385 \nwith acid washed material are relevant to the field situation. 386 \nThe results show that the soil samples differ in their functional group contents from 387 \nthe corresponding isolated humic acids.  This can be taken into account in modelling by the 388 \ninclusion of additional weak acid sites, and by optimising their average pK value.  By 389 \nadopting this approach, we imply that the additional sites are due to organic matter that is 390 \nnot extractable by 0.1 M NaOH, i.e. is not isolated as humic and fulvic acids.  The non-391 \nextractable organic matter corresponds to the humin fraction, assuming the mass 392 \ncontribution of identifiable organic compounds (not strictly part of humic acid, fulvic acid 393 \nor humin) to be negligible.  To calibrate the model we have assumed all the COOH are on 394 \nthe extractable humic matter, but it is also possible that some are on the humin.  In either 395 \nevent, the humin must be much richer in weak acid groups than carboxylic acids.  The 396 \ndeduced preponderance of weak acid groups in the humin accords with the findings of 397 \nZelanzny & Carlisle (1974) who reported humin to contain a higher proportion of phenolic 398 \n EJSS-026-08 REVISION \n18 \ngroups than fulvic or humic acids, possibly because it is rich in lignin.   Stevenson (1994) 399 \nreferred to \u201cinherited humin\u201d, by which is meant \u201caltered lignin-like polymers and\/or 400 \nmicroscopic (subcellular) particles of plant origin\u2026.\u201d.  This type of material would be 401 \nlikely in the organic-rich soils studied here, as opposed to the humin of mineral soils which 402 \nis dominated by organic matter tightly-sorbed to mineral particulates.  From the data in 403 \nTables 2 and 3, we estimate that the weak acid group contents of the humin fraction are 404 \n1.8, 5.3 and 3.1 mmol g-1 for the Peat, Podzol and Ranker respectively.  These cannot be 405 \nconsidered precise because they depend on the modelling assumptions, but it is certain that 406 \nthe soils contain significant numbers of weak acid groups that are not estimated from the 407 \nextractable humic matter.  408 \nOther possible contributors to the weak acid contents of the Ranker and Podzol 409 \nsamples are silica and\/or aluminosilicates, which must account for most or all of the 410 \nmineral fractions of these soils, and which possess surface hydroxyl groups that would 411 \nionize at high pH in the titration experiments.  Their possible contributions can be 412 \nestimated from the typical hydroxyl group content (c. 8 \u00b5mol m-2; Lofts and Tipping, 413 \n1998) and density (2.7 g cm-3; Iler, 1979) of silica.  We calculate that for silica particles at 414 \nthe upper end of the clay size range (i.e. about 2 \u00b5m diameter), the mineral matter would 415 \ncontribute c. 0.002 mmol of weak acid groups per gram of soil sample, which is negligible 416 \ncompared to the estimated total contents from the titrations of c. 1 mmol g-1 (see Results).  417 \nFor the silica weak acid groups to be significant, a particle size of about 10 nm would be 418 \nrequired, which is highly unlikely; indeed visual inspection of the mineral matter in the 419 \nPodzol and Ranker samples suggests the predominance of silt and sand-sized mineral 420 \nmatter.  For the same reasons, it is unlikely that interactions between the organic and 421 \nmineral components would significantly modify the charging behaviour of the organic 422 \n EJSS-026-08 REVISION \n19 \nmatter.  Therefore we conclude that the acid functional groups in the acid-washed soils are 423 \ndue almost entirely to the organic matter. 424 \n The inclusion of extra type B (weak acid) binding sites in Model VI-FD2 means 425 \nthat we have effectively  defined a soil component that is a combination of  humic acid and 426 \nhumin.  For soil in the aggregated state, with electrostatic properties modelled in terms of 427 \nthe fixed-Donnan volume, the presence of the extra type B sites does not compromise the 428 \nunderlying theory of the model, as long as only protons are considered.  However, the 429 \nhumic acid and humin must, by definition, differ with respect to dispersion (including 430 \nsolubility), and so strictly speaking the two materials should be modelled separately when 431 \nthe soil is dispersed.  But as shown by the results in Figure 5, this is not of any great 432 \nsignificance because the soil titration properties differ little from the fully-aggregated case 433 \nwhen dispersion follows equation (8) with \u03b2 values greater than 3.  Another point that 434 \narises from the humic acid \/ humin component is the formulation of multidentate sites for 435 \nmetals, which is accomplished in Model VI in terms of proximity factors, calculated from 436 \nmolecular dimensions, and assuming that the ligand atoms are present on the same 437 \nmolecule.  In previous work (Smith et al., 2004) we assumed that the proximity factors also 438 \napply to aggregated soil, although there might be scope for additional multidentate sites to 439 \nbe formed by ligand atoms on different adjacent molecules.  With the inclusion of the 440 \nhumin type B sites, this possibility increases.  More data on metal binding, and modelling 441 \nwork, are needed to resolve this issue. 442 \n The parameters derived by applying the model to the titration data are not all 443 \nprecisely defined, because different combinations can provide comparable fits.  Therefore 444 \nwe restricted some of the allowable values.  Since the suspension effect is assumed to be 445 \ndue to interactions between soil particles and the pH electrode, a common value of \u03b1SE is 446 \nclearly warranted, and the best value of 0.2 implies that the electrode experiences 20% of 447 \n EJSS-026-08 REVISION \n20 \nthe protons residing in the Donnan volume or diffuse zone.  The relatively low value of 448 \npKHB, again forced to apply to each soil, means that the average additional (humin-449 \nassociated) type B site is a somewhat stronger acid than the average humic acid type B site.  450 \nWe restricted the value of nB to be either 2 nA  or 4 nA because of the anticipated need to 451 \nincorporate multidentate site formulations into Model VI-FD2 when it is applied to metals 452 \n(see above), but it was necessary to permit the different soils to have different nB \/ nA 453 \nrelationships.  Finally, the fitted values of fHS for the Peat and Podzol are in good  454 \nagreement with the soil contents of NaOH-extractable carbon (Table 2), which correspond 455 \nto fHS values of 0.35 and 0.28 respectively if carbon is assumed to account for 50% of the 456 \nhumic matter.  Agreement is less good for the Ranker, for which the NaOH-extractable 457 \ncarbon content corresponds to fHS = 0.30, about 50% greater than the fitted value.  This 458 \ndiscrepancy cannot be accounted for by differences in the humic acids aming the soils, 459 \nbecause they give closely similar titiration behaviour (Cooke et al., 2007; Figure 1). 460 \nWe are unaware of any previous work in which the suspension effect has been 461 \ntaken into account in the interpretation of titration data for organic soils, and this at least 462 \npartly reflects the fact that under most experimental conditions its influence is negligible.  463 \nBut we have found it to be important in concentrated suspensions at low ionic strength, and 464 \ntherefore have included a correction term (equation 7), the use of which is supported by the 465 \nresults of a small experiment.  After making this correction, we find that there is no 466 \ndiscernible concentration effect on the pH titration behaviour of any of the soils, within the 467 \nconcentration range 2 to 150 g l-1 (Figure 4).   This result supports the extrapolation of the 468 \nexperimental results and modelling to field situations.  Indeed, in the case of peat, it is not 469 \nuncommon to encounter field water contents in excess of 80%, which would correspond to 470 \na solids concentration of a few hundred grams per litre, similar to the highest concentration 471 \nthat we used in our experiments.   472 \n EJSS-026-08 REVISION \n21 \nThe use of a fixed Donnan volume to model ion-binding by organic soils is based 473 \non the idea that counterions accumulate in a zone that is defined by the aggregate structure 474 \nof the soil, rather than in a diffuse layer surrounding the soil particles.  This picture gives 475 \nrise to a much higher dependence on ionic strength than is found for samples of either 476 \nisolated humic substances or organic soils that have been dispersed at high pH (Cooke et 477 \nal., 2007).  The different behaviour is due to the electrostatic properties of the aggregates 478 \nunder low ionic strength conditions, as illustrated by the simulations of Figure 5.  The lack 479 \nof dependence of the titration results on suspension concentration (see above) shows that 480 \ndispersion cannot be brought about by dilution, which suggests that the aggregates are 481 \nfairly stable at acid pH values.  For these acid soils in situ the organic matter must be in the 482 \naggregated form, since it will not have been exposed to high pH conditions.  More 483 \ngenerally, it is probably not pH per se, but the net organic matter charge or potential, 484 \ndetermined by interactions with cations such as Al3+ and Ca2+ as well as H+, that governs 485 \naggregation (Tipping and Woof, 1991; Weng et al., 2002). 486 \n During the titration experiments, changes in the degree of dispersion of the organic 487 \nmatter which occur as the pH is increased are not taken into account by Model VI-FD2, 488 \nwhich assumes a fixed-Donnan volume under all circumstances.  Using a plausible pH-489 \ndependence of dispersion (equation 8), we found that, as long as the main dispersion 490 \nprocess takes place at pH values above the acid range, the simulations are not greatly 491 \naffected (Figure 5).  This is because the fixed-Donnan volume and impermeable-sphere 492 \nelectrostatic models differ less in their predictions of ionic strength dependence when the 493 \nsoil bears a relatively high charge.  Therefore as the pH increases, the choice of model 494 \nbecomes less important, and the degree of dispersion has less influence.   495 \nWe propose that Model VI-FD2 is an improved description of ion binding by solid-496 \nphase soil organic matter, but we advocate the use of the conventional Humic Ion-Binding 497 \n EJSS-026-08 REVISION \n22 \nModel VI to describe interactions in solution.  Therefore to simulate partitioning and 498 \ntransport in the field, a combination of the models would be needed.  Similarly, the NICA-499 \nDonnan model (Kinniburgh et al., 1999) deals well with solution reactions, using a Donnan 500 \nvolume that depends upon ionic strength.  But Gustafsson & Berggren Kleja (2005) have 501 \nshown that the current NICA-Donnan parameterisation does not account for the ionic 502 \nstrength dependency observed in acid-washed peat, i.e. it fails in the same way as Model 503 \nVI.  To apply the NICA-Donnan model to soil solids, we suggest the adoption of a fixed 504 \nDonnan volume, together with modification of the soil organic matter binding site content. 505 \nThe underlying reason for conducting this and similar work is to create models that 506 \ncan describe field soils and catchments.  For example, Model VI is at the heart of the 507 \nCHemistry of the Uplands Model (CHUM), which has been used to simulate the effects of 508 \nacidifying pollutants and heavy metals on soil-water systems (Tipping et al., 2006a,b).  509 \nThe incorporation of Model VI-FD2 into CHUM would improve the description of low 510 \nionic strength soil systems, which dominate most natural and semi-natural habitats of the 511 \nUK and elsewhere.  Moreover, while field soils do not experience ionic strength ranges as 512 \nlarge as those employed in our experiments, storm events can deliver high concentrations 513 \nof sea salts to upland catchments in countries with maritime climates, and cause episodic 514 \nacidification (e.g. Langan, 1989), which might be better explained with Model VI-FD2.  515 \nFurthermore, although the additional weak acid groups that we have identified from our 516 \ntitration studies are not expected to have much influence on proton binding at field pH 517 \nvalues, they could be involved in metal binding, and again use of Model VI-FD2 might be 518 \nprovide better predictions than the current version.  It is therefore worthwhile to continue 519 \nthe development and testing of ion-binding models based on data for acid-washed organic 520 \nsoils, and to evaluate their predictions with field data.  521 \n 522 \n EJSS-026-08 REVISION \n23 \n 523 \nConclusions 524 \n1. Soil organic matter samples from three different soil types (Peat, Podzol H layer, 525 \nRanker) display similar proton-binding characteristics. 526 \n2. The soil organic matter possesses proportionally more weak acid groups than do 527 \nhumic acids isolated from the same soils.  The additional weak acid groups reside 528 \nin the humin fraction, at a content of  c. 2 - 5 mmol g-1.  529 \n3. The electrostatic properties of the soils are governed by their aggregated state, 530 \nespecially at low ionic strength, and this gives rise to a high pH dependence of 531 \nproton binding.   532 \n4. The acid-base titration behaviour of the soils over wide ranges of pH and ionic 533 \nstrength can be modeled successfully, if the additional weak acid groups are taken 534 \ninto account, and with the assumption of counterion accumulation in a fixed-535 \nDonnan volume.   536 \n5. Proton binding is independent of soil concentration in the range 2 \u2013 150 g l-1, 537 \nwhich supports the extrapolation of the findings to the field. 538 \n 539 \n 540 \n 541 \nAcknowledgements 542 \nThis research was funded by the U.K. Natural Environment Research Council (NERC). 543 \nGratitude is expressed to Jan Mulder and Nicholas Clarke for help in obtaining the 544 \nNorwegian soil sample, and to Sarah Thacker and Gillian Ainsworth for help in sample 545 \nanalysis.
