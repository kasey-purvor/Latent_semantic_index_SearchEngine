His late work provides an impressive array of concepts that enables a \nmulti-dimensional analysis of the historical, material and discursive facets of \npower. What is missing from this approach is the factor of passionate \nattachments, or what we might term the sublime motivations that underlie any \nregime of control. Lacan\u2019s ethical thought prioritizes precisely the issue of the \nsublime, and, more to the point, the process of sublimation which establishes \nan effective \u2018short-circuit\u2019 between socially-valorised objects and direct drive \nsatisfactions of individuals. Key here is the notion of das Ding, the place of \nthe absent object of primordial satisfaction that generates libidinal enjoyment \nand draws the subject toward the pinnacle of social valorisation. Lacan thus \nshows us what Foucault cannot theorize. That is to say, if sublimation \nconsists of a relation to the real of das Ding, then it cannot be limited in the \nterms of its activation to the powers of discursive domain alone; it remains a \nself-initiating and self-regulating form of power. \n \nKey Words: Ethics, Lacan, Foucault, das Ding, sublimation, power \n \n \nSublime motivations \nThe work of Michel Foucault has proved an important influence in the arena \nof the critical and theoretical psychology that Theory and Psychology has \ndone so well to explore over the last 20 years. This has proved the case not \nonly methodologically (Hook, 1999; Ibanez, 1991; Yates & Hiles, 2010), but \nalso in terms of plotting the relation between power and subjectivity \n(Amigot & Pujal, 2009; Guilfoyle, 2007; Hook, 2002; Joy, 1993). While the \n 2 \ncurrent paper wishes to make a contribution to this literature, it hopes to do \nso via means of an adjunct to Foucault\u2019s theorization of power provided by \nanother French intellectual whose work has itself gained increasing \nprominence in Theory and Psychology over the last several years (Dunker, \n2008; Malone, 2000, 2007, 2008; Parker, 2005, 2008; Shingu & Funaki, \n2008; Vanheule & Verhaeghe, 2001; Webb & Sells, 1995): Jacques Lacan.  \nWhat is often elided in more polarizing comparisons of Foucault and \nLacan\u2019s work (Copjec, 1994) is the fact of an important parallel: both, \ntheorists, at particular moments in their work, turn their attention to the topic \nof ethics (Rajchman, 1991). Lacan\u2019s most developed engagement with this \nsubject occurs in The Ethics of Psychoanalysis. Foucault\u2019s ethical turn forms \npart of his elaboration of the notion of technologies of subjectivity in the \n1980\u2019s. This, as I will go on to argue, proves to be a telling comparison, one \nwhich shows up a potential weakness in Foucault\u2019s ethical thought. \nAlthough his late conceptualizations of power \u2013 his influential notions of \ngovernmentality, biopolitics, disciplinarity, and so on - prove indispensable \nto any contemporary analytics of power, this formidable array of concepts \nnonetheless fails to grasp a crucial element in the maintenance of power. It is \nprecisely in view of the Foucauldian approach to ethical technologies of the \nself, I claim, that we can isolate a crucial failing: the sublime motivations or \n\u2018passionate attachments\u2019 underlying regimes of control. \n My objective is not to dismiss the value and perspicacity of the above \nFoucauldian notions. To the contrary, one of my concerns lies with the \nquestion of how certain Foucauldian analytical devices might need to make \nreference to the unlikely ally of psychoanalysis so as to overcome blind-\nspots introduced by an unwavering methodological commitment to \ngenealogical historicism. Put differently, one might \u2013 oddly enough - \n 3 \nexpress a fidelity to Foucault even by way of recourse to psychoanalysis. An \noriginal line of speculation might be opened up in this way, by asking what \nextra-discursive powers of \u2018the real\u2019 \u2013 as opposed to productive ensembles \nof discourse - might come to be enlisted in the establishment of workable \napparatuses of control. We should thus ask: what modes of impossibility, \nthat is to say, what impasses of desire, what forms of libidinal enjoyment \n(jouissance) are implied (if not in fact presumed) within the conjunctions of \npower-knowledge that Foucault understands within the logic of the \ndispositif?  \n \nEthical technologies of self \nGiven that I have discussed Foucault\u2019s notion of ethics in some detail \nelsewhere (2007), I will limit myself to providing only a minimal outline \nhere. For Foucault, and scholars like Dean (1999) Rose (1991, 1996) \ninspired by this period of his work, ethics is comprised of the \u2018conduct of \nself-conduct\u2019, those techniques of self whereby individuals affect a variety \nof operations \u201con their own bodies and souls, thoughts, conduct and way of \nbeing\u201d (Foucault, 1988a, p. 18).  Of great importance for Foucault (1988b) is \nthe fact that a potential gap separates normalizing, regulative technologies of \nsubjectivity from their individualized activation and rearrangement. In the \ncase of the former we have a series of regulative discursive routines of self-\nknowledge and practice that are articulated in the norms of health and \nbetterment. In the case of the latter we have the properly ethical domain of \nthe personalized, indeed, aesthetic care of the self. This, in rudimentary \nterms, is the basic distinction between normative morality and ethical \nindividuality. \n 4 \n One of the strengths of this account, certainly for scholars like Rose, \nis that it shows how the realm of ethical individuality is all too often over-\ndetermined by the values and practices of prevailing normative (and \nnormalizing) morality. That is, Foucault\u2019s account of technologies of \nsubjectivity enables us to plot the downward saturation of power, to capture \nthe interchange between structural apparatuses of influence and the micro-\npolitics of self in such a way that we are able to understand how \u2018deeply\u2019 \nprivate and personalized practices of self are already political operations \nlinked to the broader objectives of the governmentality of the state. \nNow while it is important to note that the ethical technologies of self \ndiscussed by Foucault (1988c, 1988d) - unlike those analyzed by Rose \n(1991) - are drawn from a wide historical range, and are not always thus \nlinked to explicitly normalizing expertise, or, indeed delimited by the \nprotocols of disciplinary knowledge. Nonetheless, despite that for the later \nFoucault there is the possibility of ethical practices of freedom (1988c), this \nconceptualization nonetheless still runs up against a problem. Foucault\u2019s \nethical technologies of self seem oddly bloodless, detached from any \nmotivating passions, lacking in affective intensity. Such a depiction hardly \naccords with the raptures of practice presumably accompanying the vigour \nof the ascetic preoccupations that Foucault (1988c, 1988d) himself \ndiscusses, such as those of spiritual, dietary or sexual discipline. These are \nnot practices without a libidinal dimension; they are often linked precisely to \n\u2018sublime\u2019 aims, to \u201cthe goals\u201d, to quote Foucault \u201cof happiness, purity, \nwisdom, perfection and immortality\u201d (1988a, p. 18) that are, for many worth \nliving and dieing for.  \nWhat is it then, we should ask, that drives and inspires such practices? \nNot surely simply the banal impetus of the \u201cideals of scientific, political and \n 5 \nphilanthropic experts\u201d (Rose, 1991, p. 213), the life-objectives prescribed by \ntoday\u2019s generic norms of subjectivity? Surely these targets have to be \nunderstood against the context of a far more passionate set of attachments, \nespecially so if we are to account for the subject-driven impetus that \nFoucault so often alludes to? \nWe are here approaching the realm of the sublime, of something not \nmotivated merely by biopolitical regulation, disciplinary normalization or \ndiffused technologies of subjectivity and governmentality, however \ndispersed or discontinuous, for indeed, it is often precisely against such \nforces of the sublime \u2013 as in the case of the racist \u201cnational Thing\u201d invoked \nby \u017di\u017eek (1993) - that the state is obliged to act. Switching to a \npsychoanalytic register, one would say we have arrived at the question of the \ndrives and their social mediation, or, more particularly, at the challenging \nissue of the drives in relation to sublimation, to what is accorded the highest \nvalues in a culture.  \n \nThe dilemmas of sublimation \nLacan devotes the second section of Seminar VII, The Ethics of \nPsychoanalysis, to the problem of sublimation, to revising this key notion of \nFreudian thought that by 1959 had become so riddled with contradictions \nthat its ongoing viability as a clinical tool was under serious threat. He opens \nwith a clarification, underlining the fact that in sublimation one is dealing \nwith the positive side of ethical thought, not with prohibitions and moral \nconscience, but with \u201cmoral and spiritual elevation\u201d (1992, p. 87).  Many \nsimilar qualifications \u2013 such as the idea that there can be no complete \nsublimation - will follow in Lacan\u2019s attempt to clear the way to a more \nworkable understanding of the concept of sublimation. \n 6 \nA paramount concern in dealing with the confused state of the concept \nof sublimation lies with asserting the very plasticity of the drives. In \nopposition to the more gentrified view offered by ego psychology, Lacan \naffirms that there is no pre-accommodation of the drives animating the \nhuman organism to its world, no natural fit of objects to impulses, no \nultimate resolution of the spectrum of drives into a unified genital form. \n\u201d[T]he libido, with its paradoxical, archaic so-called pre-genital \ncharacteristics, with its eternal polymorphism, with its world of \nimages\u2026linked to different sets of drives associated with different \nstages\u2026[evidences for us that] the whole microcosm has absolutely nothing \nto do with the macrocosm\u201d (p. 92). What we are contending with in the drive \nis the irreducible character of archaic forms of libido; such \u2018aspirations\u2019 will \nnever yield to full domestication: we are dealing with \u201ca point of departure \nand a nucleus that is never completely resolved under\u2026 primacy of \ngenitality or a pure and simple Vorstellung [idea]\u201d (p. 93). In addition to the \nissue of the irreducible character of the archaic libido \u2013 i.e. the original \nrecalcitrance of the drives, the fact that they never yield to full domestication \n- is the consideration that the drive has the resources of apparently limitless \npossibilities of substitution regards its ostensible goal.  \nAlready then the convergence of drive attentions onto a prescribed set \nof socially-valorized goals seems unlikely, but the problem is more \npronounced yet. We have also to take into account the fact that sublimation \ninvolves a change of objects, a change, as Lacan notes, chiming with Freud\u2019s \ndemands in Three Essays on Sexuality, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t occur through the \nintermediary of a return of the repressed nor symptomatically\u2026[but] in a \nway which satisfies directly\u201d (p. 94). There is no apparent disjunction here, \nno redirection via the means of the symptom. (The methodological contrast \n 7 \nwith Foucault\u2019s privileged methodological concept of discontinuity is \nalready pronounced here). Furthermore, insists Lacan (1992), sublimation \ncannot be collapsed into reaction-formation; it is not a defensive reaction \nthat takes the form of the opposite impulse to what is socially-prohibited. \nNor crucially, for Freud (1966a), is sublimation to be understood via the \nmechanics of repression. Freud (1966a) asks us not only to believe that the \npolymorphous field of sexual libido settles on a rather limited set of objects \n\u2013 where, moreover, it is able to find direct satisfaction \u2013 he asks us also to \naccept that these are \u201csocially valorized objects of which the group \napproves\u2026objects of public utility\u201d (Lacan, p. 94).  \nWe need ask: given the amazing latitude within which libidinal \ngratifications may be achieved \u2013 not to mention the variety of substitutions \nafforded drive-impulses - then why the regularity and intensity of investment \nin objects of collective cultural value? Lacan immediately warns against \nwhat would appear an intuitive solution, the idea, in short, that we might \nresolve this difficulty by means of reference to \u201ca simple opposition and a \nsimple reconciliation between the individual and the collectivity\u201d (p. 94). \nThere is something too convenient about this move for Lacan, whereby the \ncollective finds its satisfaction where the individual is already libidinally \ninvested. Moreover, it poses not only a singular autonomy on the side of the \nsubject\u2019s libido (the coherence of \u2018individual satisfaction\u2019 in and of itself), it \nalso implies a pre-destined integration of drive and environment that cannot \nbut strike one as anathema to Freudian theory. Besides, Lacan reminds us, \nthere is a further complication to consider here: Freud\u2019s declaration that \nsublimation is a process of object rather than ego libido. \nTo say that sublimation represents a fortuitous outcome to a \npotentially endlessly convoluted trajectory is an understatement. One thing \n 8 \nseems clear after having surveyed the dilemmas of sublimation: Lacan\u2019s best \nexplanatory hope lies not in the attempt to trace the endless complexity of a \ngiven libidinal genealogy, but rather in identifying the conditions of \npossibility underlying this field of permutations.  The enigma of how a \nshort-circuit is set up between socially-valorized objects and direct drive \nsatisfactions of the individual subject is something previous psychoanalysts \nhave attempted to resolve by looking at the attributes of the objects of \nsublimation themselves (at how they may function as \u2018stand-ins\u2019 for the \nmother, for instance), and at vicissitudes of the drive that may modulate its \ncourse without fundamentally compromising its directness. Lacan, \npredictably, follows a different course. He eschews the attempt to trace the \nroad-map of libidinal interest and their transformations; he likewise avoids \ntracking the idiosyncratic developments in the subject which would explain \nthe extraordinary contingency whereby the plasticity of the \u201ctriebe\u201d (drives) \nhappen to find direct expression in society\u2019s most prized activities and \nobjects. He prefers instead to explore more carefully what underlies this \nknotted complex of factors, to examine the necessary structural conditions \nunderlying such archaic libidinal activity. The same point can be made by \nciting Lacan: in the case of sublimation we should look predominantly \n\u201cneither to the field of the intersubjective subject, [nor to] the subject \nsubjected to the mediation of the signifier, but [rather to] what is behind this \nsubject\u201d (1992, p. 103). \n \nThe field of das Ding \nLacan\u2019s response to the dilemmas of sublimation is enabled via an ingenious \npiece of inter-textuality. He identifies what is ostensibly the same element in \ntwo otherwise chronologically and thematically-diverse aspects of Freud\u2019s \n 9 \noeuvre. The \u201cding\u201d of Project for a Scientific Psychology (1966c) is, he \nclaims, one and the same as the primordial \u2018object\u2019 of satisfaction, the \n\u201cWieder zu finden\u201d, the will to find again, present in the late (1966b) paper \non negation. The Wieder zu finden is what for Freud \u201cestablishes the \norientation of the human subject to the object\u201d (Lacan, 1992, p. 58). The \nwhole progress of the subject takes its cue from das Ding, this mythical \n\u2018proto-object\u2019 which lies \u201c[r]ight at the beginning of the organization of the \nworld in the psyche, both logically and chronologically\u201d and which provides \nthe point \u201caround which the whole adaptive development revolves\u201d (p. 57).  \nIn the Project Freud (1966c) makes a point about the subject\u2019s \nconstitutive mis-adaptation to reality, which he links to their inability to \nadequately apprehend the other, indeed, to a constitutive absence in psychic \nlife. Freud\u2019s assertion is troubling not only in view of a commitment we \nmight have to any rudimentary psychological realism \u2013 an affront, in other \nwords, to the view that the subject directly knows their empirical domain \u2013 it \nis troubling also in view of the limitations it places on inter-subjectivity, on \nour ability to ever truly to know one another. In a section of the Project \nmuch valued by Lacanians, Freud takes the example of an infant\u2019s \nperceptual engagement with another person: \n[T]he perceptual complexes proceeding from this fellow human-\nbeing will in part be new and non-comparable\u2026but other visual \nperceptions\u2026will coincide in the subject with memories of quite \nsimilar impressions of his own body\u2026 Thus the complex of the \nfellow human-being falls apart into two components, of which one \nmakes an impression by its constant structure and stays together as \na thing, while the other can be understood by the activity of \n 10 \nmemory\u2026traced back to information from [the subject\u2019s] own \nbody (1966c, p. 331). \nThis is a crucial passage. For a start, it emphasizes that the child\u2019s initial \ninterest in the other has much to do with the fact that \u201can object like this was \nsimultaneously [their] first satisfying\u2026and hostile object, as well as [their] \nsole helping power (Freud, 1966b, p. 331). There is thus a possibility of re-\nfinding pleasure here, in this object that simultaneously invokes the mother \nand the care she represents, and the prospect of a primal aggressiveness. \nThis is not the only psychical filter which characterizes the subject\u2019s \nrelationship to their fellow being. The cognitive and perceptual information \nof this other is assimilated only via the subject\u2019s experiences of their own \nbody, by the route of their own foregoing experience. Arresting as these two \nmodes of estrangement might appear \u2013 the facts that the other is known via \nits potential for pleasure\/hostility, or through the prism of the subject\u2019s \nimage of his- or herself \u2013 neither is sufficient to explain what is most \nfundamentally alien in the other, this \u2018thingness\u2019 which defies recuperation \ninto either inter-subjectivity or the terms of the reality principle. It is worth \nstressing here the factor of negativity. What knits psychological reality for \nthe subject, what makes it cohesive, is not an attunement to reality and its \nobjects, but rather a kind of subtraction. As Copjec (1994) avers, \u201cit is only \nwhen our perceptions come to refer themselves to\u2026[the] lost object of \nsatisfaction that they can be deemed objective\u201d (p. 233). This object is now \nexcluded from our perceptions of mere worldly objects despite that \u201cit now \nfunctions as that which is \u201cin them more than them\u201d\u201d (Copjec, p. 233). \n Given the dense series of formulations that Lacan will develop from \nhis re-conceptualization of the Freudian ding \u2013 particular in relation to pure \ndesire and the primacy of an unconscious Law that over-rides \u2018the good\u2019 - it \n 11 \nhelps to focus on what, for psychoanalysis, is a familiar domain of \nexemplification: the primordial relation to the mother. One can speak of the \nmother as \u201cthe maternal thing\u201d he claims, \u201cinsofar as she occupies the place \nof\u2026das Ding (p. 67). Having said this, Lacan is immediately alive to the \nreductive capacity of such an equation, even as he is aware of the \nimportance of the initial location of the mother within the co-ordinates of \ndas Ding. (\u201cKleinian theory\u201d, Lacan notes, in the ambivalent tone \ncharacteristic of his discussions of Klein, \u201cdepends on its having situated the \nmythic body of the mother at the central place of das Ding\u201d (1992, p. 106)). \nImportantly then, while Lacan clearly does want to understand the relations \nof the subject to something primordial \u2013 indeed, in terms of \u201cits attachment \nto the\u2026most archaic of objects\u201d (p. 106) - he nevertheless wishes to avoid \nthe fixity of a singular, \u2018nuclear\u2019 object and its variants. He prefers instead to \nprovide a operational definition of the field of das Ding which establishes \nthe framework for such relations, for such Things.  \n \nThe force of subtraction \nWhen it comes to sublimation then, Lacan is less interested in the redirection \nof drives than with the opening up of a space, with a vacuum of jouissance. \nThis voracious absence is strictly coterminous with that aspect of the other \nwhich evades human recognition, with that thing-like element which cannot \nbe retrieved into symbolic or imaginary registers. In the case of das Ding we \nare dealing with the vanishing-point of humanity, with the radical alterity of \nthe Nebenmensch (neighbour), with a blind-spot in psychical and moral \napprehension that cannot be overcome, even by the most sincere attempts at \nempathy or inter-subjectivity. Such an unknowability cannot be reduced \nmerely to \u2018otherness\u2019; it is tantamount instead to a cavity of desire, a \n 12 \n\u2018swallowing abyss\u2019 that inculcates a response - indeed, an economy of \nattraction and avoidance - within the subject. Lacan has thus substituted for \nthe lost primordial object of jouissance, a place, a power of emptiness, which \nmakes such an object possible.  \nLike the hollowness of the vase which for Heidegger (1968) defines \nits function \u2013 \u201cIf the vase may be filled\u201d, says Lacan, \u201cit is because\u2026in its \nessence it is empty\u201d (p. 120) \u2013 this is a thoroughly paradoxical emptiness. \nHence Lacan\u2019s comments: \u201cthe Thing\u2026is there in a beyond\u201d, \u201c\u2026the Thing \nis not nothing, but literally is not\u201d (1992, p. 63). This is a nihil \u2013 a \nnothingness turned inside out, as one might put it - which engenders a kind \nof being; a nothing with a generative capacity. It is a fully positivized \nabsence, an \u2018extracted\u2019 structural space for which there is no pre-ordained \nobject, and for which there can be no perfect fit. Nonetheless, like the black-\nhole to which it is often compared, das Ding exerts a potent gravitational \nfield, and in so doing it elicits sublime passions \u2013 and, wagers Lacan, effects \nof creation - ex nihilo, out of a void. This then is the productive force of \nsubtraction which is able to bring Things into existence on the basis of its \nsheer emptiness. So although no single object can occupy this space \nindefinitely, an ongoing succession of \u2018sacred\u2019 cultural objects and practices \nwill be resident here, assuming, at particular historical junctures, the sublime \nstatus according such a position.  \nWhat Lacan achieves with this conceptualization is to connect more \nexplicitly the inassimilable foreignness that is das Ding to the impossible \nobject of the Wieder zu finden. More than this, he pinpoints the place of the \nprimal object of desire, isolating thus the pull of a radical form of desire \nwhich must remain empty, never finally embodied in any one object. He \nthus sets us on the track of a psychoanalytic ethics, which is an ethics of the \n 13 \nfidelity to the empty form of desire itself (Neill, 2007, Zupan\u010di\u010d, 2000) over \nand above the particularity of any of its instantiations. \nThe extraordinary object status of das Ding helps Lacan resolve - or at \nleast clarify - certain of the paradoxes of Freud\u2019s object of \u2018primordial \nsatisfaction\u2019. We are presented here with an ostensibly negative ontology. \nThis is an object, thought to embody a type of full jouissance, which the \nsubject never possessed but that remains nevertheless more real \u2013 certainly \nin its ability to inculcate desire - than anything that they do; an object that is \nstrictly irretrievable despite our incessant attempts at its (impossible) re-\nfinding. This is an object, moreover, that puts into play a fantasmatic \nprehistory: what we never had is now the \u2018what came before\u2019, and that \nwhich is fundamentally inaccessible is that which we believe we can enjoy \nonce again. \nThere is a further complication involved in Lacan\u2019s re-\nconceptualization of the primordial object of desire. This \u2018proto-object\u2019 of \ndas Ding is both that which inaugurates an original division in the \nexperience of reality \u2013 the division which sets desire in motion \u2013 and that \n\u201cfrom within the subject which finds itself led to a first outside\u201d (Lacan, \n1992, p. 52). How then are we to resolve this contradiction in which das \nDing, the \u2018first outside\u2019, correlates to something within the subject, without \ndeferring to a na\u00efve account of projection, something which Lacan clearly \nwishes to avoid? It helps to reiterate again here that we are not speaking \nsimply of an object of perceptual reality, an object in the phenomenological \nfield which corresponds to a representation the subject has in mind, but of \nthe Wieder zu finden to which the perceptual work of finding \u2018real objects\u2019 is \nsubordinated. This is not as such an issue of \u2018reality correspondences\u2019, but of \nan abyss that opens up amongst the objects of the everyday world, a vacuum \n 14 \nthat is the unavoidable structural counterpart of the pull to re-find the object \nof satisfaction. The recalcitrance of this lost satisfaction and the void it \nleaves in the subject is strictly coterminous with the unsatisfactory nature of \nworldly objects, with the drive to re-find the impossible object of jouissance. \nIt is for this reason that Lacan (1992) remarks that \u201cdas Ding is at the centre \nonly in the sense that it is excluded\u201d, advancing furthermore \u201c[t]hat\u2026in \nreality das Ding has to be posited as exterior\u2026[as] something strange to me, \nalthough\u2026at the heart of me\u201d (p. 71).  Hence Lacan\u2019s subsequent \nformulations in the same seminar concerning the notion of the \u2018excluded \ninside\u2019 or \u201cextimacy\u201d, that is, the intimate exteriority of the Thing. It is for \nthe same reason that \u017di\u017eek offers a description of das Ding as the Thing \nfrom inner space (2000a). \n \nLaw ex nihilo \nThe above suffices as a summary of what is set in play by the force of das \nDing as a \u2018proto-object\u2019, or more accurately, as the evacuated object of \ndesire that is co-extensive with the radically vacated place occupied by the \nsublime. Not only then are we confronted in das Ding with the founding of \ndesire: this absence evokes for us, in its empty abyssal aspect, the possibility \nof a primordial enjoyment that has long since been voided, and whose \nreplacement remains an impossible imperative. We are destined as such to \nconfront a succession of secondary objects that pale in comparison to a \nformer satisfaction, to something bigger, more gigantic in libidinal value. \nWhat results is precisely a kind of massification whereby das Ding \u2013 despite \nthat its presumed satisfactions cannot be accessed, despite that it has no \nobject-existence \u2013 looms larger than the perceptual reality of everyday \nobjects. \n 15 \nWe must not neglect the fact that das Ding is for Lacan the epicentre \nof jouissance, it is \u201cenjoyment incarnated\u201d, a vortex that exerts upon us the \nfascination of a consuming enjoyment that we desperately hold at bay even \nas it draws us ever closer in. Lacan evokes in this respect the etymological \nlink in French between \u2018to search\u2019 and \u2018detour\u2019 to ground his description of \nthis, the magnetic field of attractions and repulsions implied by the presence \nof das Ding. There is thus a push-pull relation, a type of suspension in \noperation which necessitates that we don\u2019t come too close, that we keep our \ndistance. This is how Lacan understands the regulations of the pleasure \nprinciple in Seminar VII, as that which governs the search for the object in \nsuch a way that detours and avoidances play an integral role, and that result \nin an orbiting motion, a monitored distance \u201cfrom that which it gravitates \naround\u201d, such that \u201c[t]he object to be found confers on the search its \ninvisible law\u201d (Lacan, 1992, p. 58).  \nThe automatic regulation of an orbiting distance to a \u201cfull\u201d jouissance \nthat would consume us, this asymptotic line of approach is what for Lacan \nunderlies the persistence and the apparent universality of the incest taboo. \nWe are dealing here with the instantaneous generation of an unconscious \nlaw, a law of distance, of prohibition \u2013 and here we find a longstanding \nanthropological conundrum - not simply generated within or by culture but \nwhich is, by contrast, sometimes treated as the basis for culture itself.  It is a \nlaw for which we are able to find innumerable justifications and reasons \u2013 a \nlaw which culture no doubt institutionalizes and obeys \u2013 despite that it \npredates such proscriptions. We have thus the odd convergence that Lacan \npoints to, of that which is prohibited and that which is anyway impossible. \n \n \n 16 \n \nThe position of the Thing \nThis is what a Foucauldian analytics fails to grasp in its insistence on \ngrounding the complex historical and discursive causes underwriting various \ndevelopments of power: the spontaneous emergence \u2013 and, indeed, the great \ntenacity - of an unconscious law that regulates the relation to the Thing. This \nis a law before culture, certainly before discursive constructions, that various \ncultural and symbolic institutions are able to use as their affective base. The \n\u201cgrey, meticulous and patiently documentary\u201d (Foucault, 1984, p. 76) work \nof detailed genealogical analysis will register the effects of such nodal points \nof libidinal investment without being able to adequately explain them. The \napparent ex nihilo emergence of such a law, and its structural necessity \nwithin the field of jouissance and desire, means that it is not easily rooted in \nthe genealogical field of contingent material forces and discursive power-\nrelations.  \nWe are in a better position now to appreciate the well-known \nLacanian definition of sublimation as \u201cthe object elevated to the dignity of \nthe Thing\u201d and how it might apply to a critique of Foucault. As noted above, \nLacan bypasses a particular route of analytical engagement in his account of \nsublimation, a route which, interestingly enough, might be said to \ncorrespond to aspects of Foucault\u2019s genealogical tracking of the formative \npowers of technologies of subjectivity. Rather than relying on the steady \naccumulation of layer upon layer of historical data, embarking on a search \nthat tackles \u201ca field of entangled and confused parchments\u2026.documents that \nhave been scratched over and recopied many times\u201d (Foucault, 1984, p. 76), \nLacan opts instead to isolate the necessary conditions of possibility \nunderlying sublimation. He thus avoids what a Foucauldian framework of \n 17 \ntechnologies of self implies it can provide: an itinerary connecting a given \nsubject\u2019s practices and objects of sublimation \u2013 that is, the privatized or \nindividualized domain of ideals (in Foucault\u2019s terms, ethics) \u2013 to what is \nsacred to or valued by a culture \u2013 that is, the vaunted ideals of a particular \nculture and its technologies of subjectivity (for Foucault, the realm of \nmorals).  \nLacan\u2019s approach, by contrast, is to point to a necessary structural \nplace around which a culture\u2019s select objects and practices come to coalesce. \nRather than painstakingly tracing all of the multiple permutations whereby \nthe influence of sublime cultural objects come to be effectively \nindividualized, he opts to looks to what functions as a precondition of such \nvaried lines of articulation and influence. By focussing on das Ding as the \nproto-object, or, more accurately, as the object-place, he avoids the detoured \ncircuit of a modulated drive across the varying and changing terrain of a \nculture\u2019s most valued objects: das Ding is always, as it were, the direct \n\u2018unmediated\u2019 drive target. The methodological privileging of discontinuity \nhere is to miss the point. \nIn more straightforward terms, it is the structural place which is \nprimary, not the objects or practices which come to occupy this place, which \nare of course subject to considerable socio-historical variation. Moreover, it \nis not the direction of the drive that is changed, diverted \u2013 as in other \npsychoanalytic theorizations - what is changed is the status of the object, its \nposition in the structure of fantasy. This object, which under different \nconditions may be pathetic, deplorable, wholly undesirable, is, to borrow \nKay\u2019s wonderful phrase, \u201cthoroughly irradiated by the drive, bathed in \njouissance, transfigured, spiritualized and resplendent\u201d (2003, pp. 54-55) \nonce it is elevated to this position. One needs emphasize here the radically \n 18 \ninter-subjective status of fantasy in Lacanian theory, the fact that fantasmatic \nobjects are always the response given to the vexing question of what the \u2018big \nOther\u2019 \u2013 the amassed embodiment of a given social-historical-cultural \nnetwork of values - is imputed to want. Never merely private then (or, \nindeed intra-subjective), a fantasy is always a negotiated outcome, a \nhypothesis generated by an individual\u2019s or a society\u2019s best guess at what its \nOther most desires. Importantly then, the concept of the Other operates at \nboth the level of the individual subject and at that of the imaginary of a \ngiven society. As De Kesel (2009) makes clear, the same holds for the \nnotion of sublimation. To this we should add the immediate qualification \nthat these two registers of sublimation are intimately connected. Indeed, in \nlight of the trans-individual nature of unconscious subjectivity \u2013 which for \nLacan is constantly generating answers to the enigma of what the Other \nwants \u2013 these orders of fantasy can never be fully separable: subjective \nfantasy occurs within the parameters of the Other, within the realm of the \nsignifier. \nThis then is where we find the short-circuit between the recalcitrance \nof archaic libido \u2013 primal drive aspirations \u2013 and socially-valorized objects. \nAnd to be sure, this is a short-circuit not only between drive and culture, but \nbetween the subjective and the collective. Inasmuch as the drive reaches \ntowards the objectives provided by the co-ordinates of (radically inter-\nsubjective) fantasy, this drive will directly and \u2018automatically\u2019 be put on \ncourse towards the cultural Thing. \nWhy then does this notion of the Thing make for such a crucial \ncontribution to the theorization of psychical power? Why, furthermore, does \nit deliver such a telling blow to the empirico-historicist Foucauldian \nenterprise of tracing multiple (if discontinuous) lines of causality within the \n 19 \nover-arching schema of disciplinary-bio-power? It is crucial because it \nmakes clear that you do not have to be acted upon to sublimate, to produce \nversions of das Ding that both tie you into a culture and that lock you into a \nregimes of adherence, reverence and distance relative to it. Just as das Ding \nis not the result of repression, so it is equally not the result of even a positive \nor proactive coercion, of Foucault\u2019s productive powers of technologies of \nsubjectivity. Das Ding is not to be located within the rationality of effects; it \nis not a produced effect but is instead a precondition of a variety of effects. \nOne must here agree with Dolar (1999): many of the \ndisciplinary\/governmental outcomes that Foucault seizes upon in his later \ngenealogical works may thus be explained, at least partially, without \nreference to the complicated apparatuses and attenuated rationalities of \ngovernmentality. Indeed, the latter may be said to presuppose a variety of \npsychical mechanisms, of which the orchestrations of sublimation would \nseem crucial. \nVia his re-conceptualization of the Freudian problematic of \nsublimation, Lacan shows us what Foucault cannot theorize, namely the fact \nof a self-instantiating form of productive power that does not require a direct \ncausative connection to a heterogeneous ensemble of material forces and \ndiscursive practices. If sublimation consists of a relation to the real of das \nDing, then it cannot be limited in the terms of its activation and ongoing \ninsistence to the powers of the discursive domain alone; it remains rather a \nself-initiating and self-regulating form of power. In das Ding then we have \nthen a prospective answer to the question with which we opened concerning \na particular \u2018mode of impossibility\u2019 \u2013 that is, an impasse of desire linked to a \nmobilization of jouissance - that enables power, that so extends the reach of \n 20 \nthe ensembles of power-knowledge, the technologies of subjectivity, studied \nby Foucault.  \n \nParadigms of sublimation \nLet me close with a series of questions. What might be the dispositif of a \nparticular order of sublimation? Differently put: could sublimation itself \nfunction as a category of historical analysis? Given the intersection of \nconceptual frameworks implied by such a question - the conjunction in other \nwords, of Foucauldian and Lacanian approaches, whose incompatibility is \ntypically presumed \u2013 many would query whether this is even a viable \nresearch question. Perhaps it is. Take for example Lacan\u2019s (1992) \ndescription of the emergence of the courtly love tradition, which he views as \nthe \u201cappearance, articulation, establishment, of a whole moral code\u2026a \nwhole ethic, a whole way of life\u201d (p. 125). Clearly then, courtly love is more \nthan a mode of writing, a discursive style: it entails a series of prescribed \nnorms of interaction and behaviour, and more than this, specific codes that \nfunction to regulate the relations between man and woman. In this brief \ndiscussion of historicized (\u2018ethical\u2019) codes of behaviour there is greater \nproximity between Foucault and Lacan than we may have expected. \n This discussion of the courtly love tradition cannot be ignored on the \nbasis that it lacks sufficient historical contextualization. Moreover, the \naddition of further layers of empirical analysis will not necessarily deepen \nour understanding of the longstanding cultural importance of such \nphenomena. Lacan\u2019s point is precisely that once one has examined the \nrequisite social, political and economic evidence, \u201capplied all the available \nmodes of interpretation of the superstructure\u201d, historians are still at a loss to \naccount for the endurance \u201csuccess of this extraordinary fashion\u201d (p. 125). \n 21 \n What this opens up is a distinctive and promising analytical \nperspective, one that welcomes the precision of socio-historical \ncontextualization as part of its attempt to apprehend what Leader (2002) \nrefers to as \u2018paradigms of sublimation\u2019, in other words, those frames of \nethical sensibility and practice that have gained hegemonic ascendance at \nparticular historical junctures. Courtly love would seem a perfectly viable \nsubject of consideration for a Foucauldian analytics able to plot the lateral \nspread of such codes, values and behaviours across a variety of \nparticularized institutional settings and discursive practices. One could argue \nthat this is the limitation of \u017di\u017eek\u2019s (1993) recourse to one particular \nparadigm of sublimation, that is, his frequent use of explanations of the \nnational Thing: they are not adequately informed of the texture of a variety \nof multiple institutionalized realizations, of the modulations underlying the \ngradual transformation of one version of the Thing into another. To be \nperfectly clear then: my suggestion here is by no means that a Lacanian \nperspective on impasses of desire simply negates a Foucauldian project. By \ncontrast, the Lacanian notion of paradigms of sublimation offers the prospect \nof a novel, additional category for a Foucauldian analysis of historically-\nspecific variants of power. \nThere is a related consideration. We have established that das Ding \nevades retrieval into symbolic or imaginary registers. The fact of this place, \nthe fact of its operation, and the unconscious law it entails, cannot thus be \nsaid to be constructed, they are not subject to deconstruction. Having said \nthat, Lacan is aware that the field of das Ding, let us say the various objects \nthat come to occupy this position, become the focus of imaginary, cultural \nand indeed manipulative political elaborations. There is in this sense, a \ncontinual attempt to colonize the field of das Ding, this, after all is for Lacan \n 22 \n\u201chow collective, socially acceptable sublimations operate\u201d (p. 99). This \nopens up an important question: how might it be possible to de-sublimate \ncertain cultural Things, to use de-sublimation as a political strategy? \n \nReferences \nAmigot, P. & Pujal, M.
