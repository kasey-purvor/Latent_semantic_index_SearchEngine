INTRODUCTION\nFollowing the initial investigations on chalcogenide\nglasses1 in the early 1960s, reversible switching has been\nstudied in a variety of thin-film materials including nickel\noxides,2 amorphous silicon,3 hydrogenated amorphous\nsilicon4 and, more recently, hydrogenated amorphous\n(silicon-rich) silicon carbide.5,6 A typical switching device\nconsists of a thin-film material sandwiched between two\nmetal contacts, forming a metal\u2013semiconductor\u2013metal\n(MSM) or metal\u2013insulator\u2013metal (MIM) device. A suitable\nvoltage pulse applied to the top contact of the device causes\na transition from a high to a low resistance state in a process\ncalled forming. Once formed, the device can be switched\nback and forth between the two states by applying a slightly\nlower voltage pulse of alternating polarity. A prerequisite in\nthe practical application of MSM structures as switching de-\nvices is reproducibility in forming voltages and on-\nresistances. Research has shown that this can be achieved by\nintroducing defects by design into the MSM structure prior to\nforming. Techniques such as current stressing7 and doping5\nhave been used in the past to introduce defects. Ion-beam\nbombardment, more recently used, produces dangling bonds,\nwhich form defect states in the band gap of the semiconduc-\ntor material. This study examines the electrical properties,\nprior to forming, of a thin film of hydrogenated amorphous\nsilicon sa-Si:Hd sandwiched between Cr contacts, with glass\nas the substrate. The film was bombarded with Si to a range\nof doses and patterned into 2003200-mm2-size devices, thus\nallowing a study of the electrical properties as a function of\ndose.\nUnlike most previous bombardment work8,9 where low-\nenergy ions were used to damage the top metal\u2013\nsemiconductor (MS) interface region as a way of modifying\nthe Schottky barrier, we have implanted Si deep into the\nmiddle of the a-Si:H layer so that the damage extends to\nwithin the bulk of the active region. This is intended to en-\nsure that both the Schottky barrier and bulk transport prop-\nerties are affected. By self-implanting Si, we eliminate any\nchemical effects so that any changes in conductivity of the\ndevice are due only to damage created in the form of dan-\ngling bonds and not as a result of doping. Information gained\nfrom this study will be useful in explaining some of the\npostforming electronic switching behavior of these devices.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE\nA layer of Cr, 100 nm thick, was sputtered on a\n232-in. glass substrate to form the back contact. On this\nwas deposited a 70-nm layer of a-Si:H by plasma-enhanced\nchemical-vapor deposition (PECVD) sSiH4\u2013320 \u00b0Cd fol-\nlowed by 150 nm of insulating SiN deposited by reactive ion\nsputtering of silicon in a nitrogen atmosphere. The resulting\nstructures were ion-beam bombarded by 30-keV Si at doses\nof 231012, 531012, and 531013 cm\u22122. The bombardment\nenergy was chosen so that the end of the range was roughly\nin the middle of the a-Si:H layer. Finally, a 60-nm Cr layer\nwas sputtered to make the top contact.

A cross-sectional view through the structures\nstudied is shown in Fig. 1. Current-density\u2013voltage sJ\u2013Vd\nmeasurements were first carried out on as-deposited devices\nusing a computer-controlled Keithley 236 Source-Measure\nunit. Samples were then furnace annealed in a nitrogen en-\nvironment for 30 min at 423, 473, 523, 573, and 623 K and\nallowed to cool down to room temperature following each\nannealing before recording the J\u2013V data. Activation energies\nwere deduced from the temperature-dependent J\u2013V data.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nFigure 2 shows the J\u2013V plots for the unbombarded and\ndevices bombarded with Si at 231012, 531012, 5\n31013 cm\u22122 doses. The asymmetry observed in the J\u2013V\nspectra between the positive and negative biases in the un-\nbombarded sample indicates that the conduction is Schottky\nbarrier controlled. From the magnitude of the saturated cur-\nrent density at zero electric field, the Schottky barrier heights\nfor the unbombarded sample are approximately 0.90 and\n0.84 eV for the top and bottom contacts, respectively. In ad-\ndition to the asymmetry, the unbombarded device displays\nthe least current. For the bombarded devices, Fig. 2 and 3\nshow that there is a progressive increase in current and J\u2013V\ncurve symmetry with dose. It is well known that long-range\ndisorder in amorphous materials causes the abrupt band\nedges typical of crystalline materials to be replaced by a\nbroadened tail of states extending from the conduction and\nvalence bands into the band gap. The degree of extension of\nthese tail states into the forbidden gap indicates the strength\nof the band tails and is proportional to the concentration of\nweak silicon\u2013silicon bonds. For bombarded materials, an in-\ncrease in dose increases bond-length and bond-angle disorder\nas well as concentration of weak silicon\u2013silicon bonds,\nwhich are manifested as an increase in the strength of the\nband tails. Furthermore, the broadening of the band tails re-\nsults in an increase in the concentration of silicon dangling\nbonds, many of which are charged. As previously noted,8,10\nthe increase in current and symmetry with dose can be attrib-\nuted to an increase in the density of defects in the bulk of the\na-Si:H. These changes, in particular, the increase in J\u2013V\nsymmetry, indicate that the introduction of defect states\nchanges the conduction mechanism from Schottky barrier to\nbulk controlled.\nThe large amount of damage created when the a-Si:H is\nbombarded with Si suggests that bulk conduction could be\nby hopping between defects via a Poole\u2013Frenkel-type\nmechanism. The Poole\u2013Frenkel effect is the thermal emis-\nsion of charge carriers from Coulombic traps in the bulk of a\ndielectric or semiconductor, enhanced by the application of\nan electric field, which lowers the surface-barrier height on\none side of the trap, thereby increasing the probability of the\nelectron escaping from the trap. The Poole\u2013Frenkel current\ndensity is given by11\nJ = J0 expS\u2212 qft \u2212 b\u02dbE\njkT D , s1d\nwhere E is the applied electric field, q the electron charge,\nand ft is the zero-field Coulombic trap barrier height. The\nparameter j in the denominator fluctuates between 1 and 2\ndepending on the level of damage.12 The Poole\u2013Frenkel co-\nefficient, b, is related to the dielectric constant, \u00abr, of the\nmaterial and is expressed as\nFIG. 1.

Equation (1) pre-\ndicts an increase in current with increasing field due to the\neffective reduction in the ionization potential, ft, by b\u02dbE. In\norder to determine if conduction is by the Poole\u2013Frenkel\nmechanism, Eq. (1) may be rewritten as\nln J =\nb\njkT\n\u02dbE + Sln J0 \u2212 qft\njkTD . s3d\nA plot of the natural logarithm of J against \u02dbE (see Fig. 3)\nreveals near-perfect symmetry in the curves as dose in-\ncreases, indicating a shift from Schottky barrier to bulk-\ncontrolled conduction via Poole\u2013Frenkel mechanism. By us-\ning Eqs. (2) and (3) we have extracted a relative permittivity\nof 12.7 for the 531013 cm\u22122 Si dose sample and values of\n8.9 and 8.6 for the 531012 and 231012 cm\u22122 Si dose\nsamples, respectively. For the unbombarded sample, Eqs. (2)\nand (3) give a relative permittivity of 24.1. This is an unre-\nalistic result which, together with the lack of J\u2013V curve sym-\nmetry between positive and negative biases, indicates that\nconduction in unbombarded devices is not by the Poole\u2013\nFrenkel mechanism. The close agreement between our ex-\nperimental relative permittivity for bombarded a-Si:H and\nthe theoretical result of 11.7, together with the excellent sym-\nmetry in the J\u2013V curves for the bombarded samples, on the\nother hand, confirms that conduction in these highly dam-\naged structures is by the Poole\u2013Frenkel mechanism.\nFigure 4 shows that as dose increases, the Coulombic\nbarrier height sftd decreases, ranging from a value of 0.89 V\nat a dose of 231012 cm\u22122 down to 0.53 V at a dose of 5\n31013 cm\u22122. There are three possible explanations for these\nvariations: a change in the Fermi level, a change12 of the\nPoole\u2013Frenkel coefficient, or the presence of high concentra-\ntions of charged defects. Since the material is undoped and\nsilicon bombardment does not introduce donors or acceptors,\nit is unlikely that there is much change in the position of the\nFermi level with bombardment dose. Furthermore, in a\nhighly damaged nonequilibrium material, the Fermi level\nshould be near the center of the band gap. Defect complexes\nsuch as those involving oxygen do introduce donors8 but the\noxygen content would need to be extremely high to shift the\nFermi level over the range needed to account for the change\nof the Coulombic barrier. Similarly the change in the Poole\u2013\nFrenkel coefficient12 is not sufficient to explain these effects.\nIt therefore seems likely that the reduction in barrier height is\ndue to the presence of a large concentration of charged\ndefects.\nIt can be shown13 that a charged defect in the vicinity of\na center emitting a carrier will lower the barrier by an\namount inversely proportional to the separation between the\ntwo centers as\nDEA0 =\nq2\np\u00ab0\u00abrra\n, s4d\nwhere ra is the distance between the centers. Thus, knowing\nra, the associated change in the charge density can be calcu-\nlated. Since the average separation is proportional to the\ncube root of the number of charged defects sNCD\n\u22121\/3d, the\nchange of barrier height decreases rapidly with increasing\ndose as is indeed seen in Fig. 4. From Eq. (4) we find that the\nconcentration of charged centers needs to be about 4.1\n31019 cm\u22123 to account for the change of 0.35 eV from a\nbombardment of 231012 to 531013 cm\u22122 Si dose. Since\neach ion has an energy of 30 keV and most of the slowing\ndown is via atomic displacements with a threshold energy of\n,25 eV, there will always be a large cascade of displace-\nments per ion. We calculate that for a dose of 4.8\n31013 cm\u22122, every atom in the layer s,531022 cm\u22123d is\ndisplaced at least once. It is therefore easy to generate a\ndefect density of 4.131019 cm\u22123.\nLarge concentrations of charged defect states are not un-\nexpected in a-Si:H since dangling-bond states are amphot-\neric and, as predicted by the defect pool model,14,15 these\nstates can be positively or negatively charged or neutral. In\nequilibrium the net charge will be zero but, following bom-\nbardment, the distribution of dangling-bond states will be\nwell away from equilibrium. Annealing up to the equilibra-\ntion temperature (,240 \u00b0C in a-Si:H) will, however, re-\nmove excess dangling-bond defect states leaving behind a\nresidual disorder, which depends on the original damage.10\nThis residual disorder determines the distribution of the re-\nmaining dangling-bond states and the strength of the band\ntails.\nFigure 5 shows the room temperature J\u2013V data for the\nsample implanted with 531013 cm\u22122 Si dose following an-\nnealing at 423, 473, 523, 573, and 623 K. The samples were\ncooled to room temperature before recording the J\u2013V curves.\nWith the increase in annealing temperature, we note a de-\ncrease in the current density and an increase in the asymme-\ntry of the J\u2013V curves, indicative of the recovery of the struc-\nture towards the reference unbombarded state. However,\nsome residual damage always remains and the reference\ncurves cannot be fully recovered for the temperature range\ninvestigated. As shown in Fig. 6, the dependence of the Cou-\nlombic barrier height on annealing temperature below 523 K\nis not very uniform for the different doses. While the lowest-\ndose sample shows a decrease in this temperature region, the\nhighest dose shows an increase and the intermediate dose\nFIG. 4. Coulombic barrier height vs dose showing a decrease in the barrier\nheight as dose increases.\n023519-3 Orwa et al. J. Appl. Phys. 97, 023519 (2005)\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

The decrease in Coulombic bar-\nrier height with annealing temperature is unusual and we\nattempt an explanation below when we address the activation\nenergy results. Between 573 and 623 K the activation energy\nincreases for all samples studied. In all cases, however, the\nbarrier height decreases with dose at all annealing tempera-\ntures in a similar manner, as shown in Fig. 4. The increase in\nthe barrier height with temperature can be explained in terms\nof defect density as was done for dependence of Coulombic\nbarrier height on dose. Annealing causes a reduction in the\nnumber of defects and increases their separation. As separa-\ntion between centers gets larger we expect the current to drop\nas the probability of hopping from center to center decreases,\nwhich could explain the observed increase in the Coulombic\nbarrier height with annealing temperature.\nTo verify our Coulombic barrier height results, we have\nperformed J\u2013V measurements at various temperatures and\nextracted the activation energy from the Arrhenius plots of\ncurrent density against temperature (see Fig. 7) according to\nthe equation\nJ = A expS\u2212 qEAkT D . s5d\nIn Eq. (5), J is the current density, EA the activation energy,\nk the Boltzmann constant, and T the ambient temperature in\nKelvin. The activation energies (filled markers) are plotted in\nFig. 6 to allow comparison with the Coulombic barrier\nheight (open markers). In general, the activation energies ob-\ntained from Eq. (5) are lower than the corresponding Cou-\nlombic barrier heights derived from the Poole\u2013Frenkel equa-\ntion because the latter is obtained by extrapolating to zero\nelectric field whereas the activation energy was measured at\n2 V. After adjusting the values for the activation energy by\nadding b\u02dbE, the results are closer together (see adjusted data\nfor 231012 Si dose in Fig. 6) and can be made to nearly\ncoincide by the addition of a further constant. What this im-\nplies is a scaling factor that is not field dependent, but pos-\nsibly dictated by either geometric or physical conditions. The\nsimilarity in the dose and temperature variation of the Cou-\nlombic barrier height and the activation energy shows that\nconduction in these bombarded devices indeed occurs by\nhopping in a manner consistent with the Poole\u2013Frenkel\nmechanism. The observed decrease in both the Coulombic\nbarrier height and the activation energy with dose is an indi-\ncation that the large number of defects created at higher\ndoses causes the density of hopping centers to increase.\nThe initial decrease in activation energy with annealing\ntemperature observed in Fig. 6 is anomalous. One would\nexpect the decrease in current with annealing temperature\nobserved in Fig. 5 to be due either to a fall in the concentra-\ntion of hopping centers or an increase in the activation en-\nergy or both. In a highly damaged nonequilibrium material,\nsuch as is the case after bombardment and prior to annealing,\nthe Fermi level should be near the center of the band gap.\nFIG. 5. J\u2013V curves showing a decrease in current density with annealing\ntemperature. The curve labeled unannealed was implanted with 5\n31013 cm\u22122 Si but not annealed. As the annealing temperature increases, the\nJ\u2013V curves become asymmetric and shift towards the unbombarded refer-\nence, indicating a partial recovery of the structure.\nFIG. 6. Dependence of Coulombic barrier height (open markers) and acti-\nvation energy (filled markers) on annealing temperature. After adjusting the\nactivation energy by adding b\u02dbE (curve labeled 231012-adj), the results are\ncloser together. The labels on the curves refer to Si bombardment dose\nsions cm\u22123d.\nFIG. 7. Arrhenius plots of current density against temperature.\n023519-4 Orwa et al. J. Appl. Phys. 97, 023519 (2005)\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\nAnnealing generally causes passivation of defects and so we\nexpect a fall in the number of hopping centers as partial\nrecovery of the preimplantation structure is achieved. This\nrecovery should push the Fermi level closer to its intrinsic\nvalue and this manifests itself as a higher activation energy\nas observed for temperatures above 500 K. Yet, the data\nclearly show a drop in both activation energy and Coulombic\nbarrier height between 420 and 520 K. Taken together with\nthe lower conduction shown in Fig. 5, it could mean that at\nlow annealing temperatures, defects are initially redistributed\nprior to being passivated. The ordering at low temperatures\ncould cause the decrease in activation energy while defect\npassivation at higher temperatures would push the Fermi\nlevel towards the band edge as well as increase the distance\nbetween hopping centers. The overall result would be an\nincrease in activation energy and Coulombic barrier height as\nobserved.\nIV. SUMMARY\nElectrical properties of a-Si:H MSM devices have been\ninvestigated as a function of bombardment dose and anneal-\ning temperature. We find that conduction in unbombarded\ndevices is Schottky barrier controlled whereas it is bulk con-\ntrolled in bombarded devices. For bulk-controlled conduc-\ntion, we observe a decrease in the zero-field Coulombic trap\nbarrier height with increasing dose, which we attribute to the\ndiminishing interdefect separation as the number of hopping\ncenters increases with dose. The close agreement between\nour experimental relative permittivity and the theoretical re-\nsult suggests that bulk conduction is by Poole\u2013Frenkel\nmechanism. This is confirmed by the similarity in dose and\ntemperature variation between Poole\u2013Frenkel-derived Cou-\nlombic barrier heights and activation energies obtained from\nArrhenius plots. The decrease in activation energy with de-\ncreasing current is anomalous and could be due to a shift in\nthe Fermi level towards the band edge.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors wish to thank EPSRC for sponsoring this\nresearch through a Portfolio Partnership grant.\n1S.
