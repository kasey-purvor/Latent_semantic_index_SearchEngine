INTRODUCTION\nTHE NUMBER of broadband users has been growingrapidly during the recent years. It is not only the number\nof users that increases but also the average data volume per\nuser; as a consequence the demand for audio and video content\nis also increasing.\nBroadcasting technology and services have been around al-\nmost as long as the radio communication itself, and have for\nmore than half a century, been a \u201cbroadband\u201d channel to the\nuser. The development now is towards fully digital broadcast\nnetworks with return channels enabling out-reaching two-way\ncommunication in addition to traditional broadcast services.\nSeveral initiatives and projects have emerged around the\nworld to provide multimedia broadcast services using an hybrid\nsatellite\/terrestrial infrastructure to provide global coverage in\na cost effective manner [1]\u2013[3]. In the context of a growing\nmarket toward mobile multimedia, many studies on innovative\nconcept of Satellite Digital Multimedia Broadcast (SDMB),\nhave been conducted [4]\u2013[6].\nThe purpose of the SDMB system is to provide capacity for\nseveral mobile operators to deliver cost effective streaming and\ndownload services directly to mobile handsets over satellite and\nterrestrial UMTS in both outdoor and indoor environments.\nManuscript received June 30, 2006; revised November 16, 2006. This work\nwas supported by the European Commission within the frame of the IST\/FP6\nintegrated project MAESTRO.\nP.

Multicast and broadcast services have up to\nnow been significantly more expensive than unicast services.\nThe cost is related to network deployment, installation of\ncustomer premises equipment, management and maintenance.\nAs the number of users increases it is expected that the cost\nper user will be less for broadcast or multicast than for unicast.\nFor unicast each new receiver adds a constant cost, while for\nmulticast the initial costs are higher but the cost of adding\nnew receivers decreases proportional with increasing number\nof receivers. However the use of multicast only makes sense\nwhen the bandwidth savings is larger than the deployment and\nmanagement cost, and for large groups multicast should be a\nprofitable and useful service.\nIn a world that is so thoroughly changing because of the im-\npact of communications services, the pricing of these services\nmust play an important role so a lot of studies about pricing have\nbeen conducted in the last years.\nA dynamic pricing mechanism was proposed in [7]. This\nadaptive pricing scheme assumes no knowledge of the demand\nfunction on the part of the network or the individual users.\nThe scheme does not always converge, due to errors in users\u2019\nexpectations and errors in price estimates, but exponential\nsmoothing of prices and demand estimates across periods\nensures convergence for the M\/M\/1 queue. Dynamic priority\npricing has also been studied extensively by Gupta et al. [8],\n[9]. They have used an innovative approach based on dynamic\nprogramming to compare dynamic pricing with fixed prices.\nGiven the computational intractability of this model, they used\nsimulations to perform their assignments. Other authors have\nconsidered the pricing problem in the context of networks\noffering Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees. In [10] the\nauthors show how the mobile users are more satisfied with\nthe fact that they can choose whether they want to be served\nquickly by being priority users with high service charges or\nact as conventional users, who get the same normal rate with\nacceptable QoS degradation. In addition, the proposed pricing\nmodel is flexible enough to alleviate traffic congestion and\nmeet expected revenue. In [11] the feasibility of dynamically\nadjusting prices based on congestion has been investigated; in\nparticular, the authors ask whether congestion-based resource\nprices can be dynamically adjusted based on changes in de-\nmand and supply. They find that such dynamic pricing can be\n0018-9316\/$25.00 \u00a9 2007 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Integrated system architecture.\naccomplished using simple gradient algorithms, but that this\napproach requires a small amount of steady communication\nabout demand and supply along each route.\nWe have already proposed and tested [12] a new efficient cost\nmodel for choosing the more suitable transmission bearer (satel-\nlite or terrestrial) in order to save service delivery cost using\nMAESTRO system architecture [1]; now we want to improve\nthat model proposing a Demand Sensitive Model (DSM) for\ntuning price service over SDMB system trying to offer a price\ndiscount to the users when the amount of users asking for an\nSDMB service is large enough to guarantee a desired profit for\nthe service provider.\nPricing can also be viewed as a mechanism by which the net-\nwork operator communicates with own users and gives them in-\ncentives to use the network efficiently; this means that it can\nimprove the value of services to users and provide stability and\nrobustness.\nThe network framework architecture consists of bi-direc-\ntional channel between the user equipment (UE) and the\nBM-SC (Broadcast Multicast\u2014Service Center) which may\nbe supported over either GPRS or UMTS-T bearer provided\nby the terrestrial Mobile Network Operator. Moreover, this\narchitecture, also involves the ability to make use of multimedia\nbroadcast\/multicast services (MBMS) [13] provided by the\nterrestrial Mobile Network Operator in addition to the SDMB\nbroadcast over satellite. In this way, a second option for routing\nof SDMB services to the end users is provided.\nThis paper first presents the system architecture, then explains\nthe proposed Demand Sensitive Model showing the results ob-\ntained through simulation studies; finally concludes the paper\nand suggests future research directions.\nII. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW\nThe system is based on a hybrid satellite & terrestrial in-\nfrastructure operating in the IMT2000 core frequency band\nallocated to Mobile Satellite Systems. It makes use of the\nUTRA FDD WCDMA (UMTS Terrestrial Radio Air interface\nFrequency-Division Duplexing) waveform in full compliance\nwith the relevant 3GPP standard to allow a very low impact on\nthe cost of 3G handset. The system relies on a very high power\ngeo-stationary satellite able to overcome indoor penetration\nconstraints in rural areas.\nAn high level overview of the generic SDMB architecture is\nshown in Fig. 1 developed in the EU F6 MAESTRO project\n[1]. It illustrates the key functional elements within the network\nthat will be used to support the SDMB service. These elements\ninclude:\n\u2022 SDMB-capable User Equipment; a dual mode T-UMTS\/S-\nUMTS mobile device enhanced to support SDMB services.\n\u2022 SDMB Satellite that will support the transmission of\nSDMB services to defined coverage areas.\n\u2022 SDMB Terrestrial Repeaters that may be deployed to en-\nhance SDMB signal availability for UEs in urban areas by\nretransmitting the satellite signal on the ground.\n\u2022 SDMB Hub that controls broadcast transmission over the\nSDMB satellite system taking as input media streams from\nthe BM-SC.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

This represents the network\nside boundary of the MBMS Bearer Service from a control\nplane perspective. This includes user specific Gmb signaling\nand MBMS bearer service specific signaling in order to sup-\nport inter-working and AAA (Authentication, Authorization\nand Accounting) functionalities. To allow the distribution of\nBM-SC functions, the Gmb protocol must support the use of\nproxies to correctly route the different signaling interactions in\na manner which is transparent to the GGSN.\nThe Gi interface is used for sending and managing IP multi-\ncast ad broadcast datagram between the mobile network and the\nBM-SC providing several techniques for QoS control.\nThe Gmb and Gi interfaces towards the SDMB Hub are\ncomposed of a sub-set of the Gmb and Gi interfaces to support\nthe functionality\/attributes which are specific to the broadcast\naspects of SDMB system, with some additional functionality to\nsupport a satellite node.\nIII. LOCATION INFORMATION SIGNALING\nLocation information must be sent to the BM-SC by each\nusers in a new specific message after the reception of the ser-\nvice announcement broadcast message. In this way the BM-SC,\ncould \u201cperiodically\u201d estimate the number of connected users\nand their location implementing the following proposed strategy\nin order to offer a price discount to the users.\nThe following time message scheme shows the communica-\ntion between the UE, the satellite Hub and the BM-SC high-\nlighted the exchanged messages over different implicated inter-\nfaces:\n1) Service Announcement message sent over the Gi inter-\nface between BM-SC and SDMB Hub\n2) Service Announcement message forwarded through the\nSDMB to each UE by broadcasting\n3) New Answer UE message sent to BM-SC via return\nchannel over Terrestrial UMTS network in order to inform\nthe BM-SC about the availability to receive the service.\nThis message represents a new feature of the system archi-\ntecture as fundamental parameter for the proposed DSM\n4) Session start request message sent over Gmb interface\n5) Session start response message sent over Gmb interface\n6) Data Transmission between BM-SC over Gi interface\n7) Data Transmission through the SDMB to each UE by\nbroadcasting\nHow it is possible to observe in Fig. 2, message number 3\nis a very fast message because it is sent through the terrestrial\nnetwork whilst messages 2 and 7 are the only two messages that\nhave a long delivery due to the satellite trip time.\nDue to the long round trip time delay between satellite hub\nand user terminal, it is better to sent the session start response\nFig. 2. Session start.\nFig. 3. Session stop.\nmessage (5) after the SDMB Resource Set Up phase execution.\nIn this way it is safely guaranteed that the necessary radio re-\nsources for the transfer of SDMB data to the interested UEs,\nwill be established before the data transmission phase (6).\n8) Session stop request message sent over Gmb interface\n9) Session stop response message sent over Gmb interface\n(Fig. 3).\nFor the same reasons connected to the long round trip delay\nover the satellite link, this new time messages sequence must be\nadopted also in the session stop phase as shown in the previous\nfigure.\nIV. DEMAND SENSITIVE MODEL (DSM)\nDemand sensitive model is one of the pricing models that\ncan be used for fast changes of prices in electronic commerce.\nPrice setting algorithm for demand sensitive model helps service\nprovider to get decision variables, price per unit that maximizes\nprofit for the quantity ordered by clients [14].\nIn [12] we proposed a simple and efficient cost model for\nchoosing the more suitable transmission bearer (satellite or ter-\nrestrial) in an integrated satellite-terrestrial UMTS architecture\nalso considering the network congestion status. Now we want\nto adapt a demand sensitive model to our system architecture in\norder to offer a price discount to the users increasing the total\nprofit for the network operator.\nA number of pricing schemes have recently been proposed\n[15]. The Flat Pricing and the Proportional Fairness Pricing\ncould seems suitable for our system architecture; nevertheless,\nthey present some drawbacks as explained in the next sections.\nA. Flat Pricing\nUnder a flat pricing scheme [16] the user is charged a fixed\namount per time unit (e.g., month), irrespective of usage. This\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

First and fore-\nmost, it is simple and convenient. Flat pricing makes no assump-\ntions about the underlying network technology that is already de-\nployed. Since charges are unrelated to usage, no measurements\nare required for billing and accounting. This also leads to social\nfairness in the sense that no distinction is made between poor\nand rich users. Provided that the flat price can be paid, anybody\ncan access the network while receiving the same service level.\nHowever, this scheme, even if it is easy to implement and very\nsuitable for our telecommunication architecture, it does not pro-\nvide any incentive or discount to the users that have no advan-\ntages to alter their transmission behavior to support the network\u2019\noperation.\nB. Proportional Fairness Pricing\nThis approach [17] consists in a whole system optimization\nthat can be decomposed into a user and a network optimization,\nin this way a user chooses his\/her price and the network allo-\ncates the rates according to the proportional fairness criterion.\nThe resulting allocation of the rates, given the willingness to\npay of each user, again solves the system\u2019s problem. The users\noptimally choose their prices and the network optimally assigns\nrates to the users. Although this scheme could be more attrac-\ntive it is not suitable for our purposes because prices are fixed\nby the users according to the indicated willingness to pay for the\nservice. The network keep track of the willingness to pay and al-\nlocate resources accordingly without offering any discount for\nthe new users.\nAccording to all the previous remarks, we propose a strategy\nof demand sensitive model based on the marginal decision rule;\nthe marginal revenue must be equal to marginal cost when set-\nting selling price. At this point selling price maximizes profit,\nproduction cost is at the lowest, and the unit price is the lowest\nwhen:\nwhere is the price elasticity of demand, and is the mar-\nginal cost. Marginal cost pricing is a particular form of usage-\nbased pricing. The higher the demand for bandwidth, the lower\nthe price the user is willing to pay for an additional unit of band-\nwidth. The demand function for bandwidth is thus downwards\nsloping.\nThis very general concept can be easily applied to our\ntelecommunication system architecture assuming that there is\none seller (the BM-SC) selling one or more types of SDMB\nservices to the mobile users. The possible SDMB services are\nsummarized in Table I.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on February 17,2010 at 11:42:16 EST from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \nPACE AND SUN: DEMAND SENSITIVE MODEL FOR TUNING PRICE OVER SDMB SYSTEM 333\nThe seller wants to sell with highest profit, and lowest pro-\nduction cost. The seller would sell by the same price to all\nbuyers willing to buy that type of commodity. The seller will\nset the first price per unit of service and as buyers increase, the\nprice will be decreasing. The seller will accumulate the buyers\u2019\norders for service to sell in bulk at lowest price.\nLet be the total production cost of a quantity , and\nthe total revenue, then, seller\u2019s profit can be calculated as\n(1)\nwhere and are functions of .\nA seller can get maximum profit when his production reaches\nthe point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, which\nis the first differential of profit with respect to quantity\n(2)\nThis marginal decision rule determines which price and\namount of quantity demanded maximizes profit. The unit price\nof a service that yields maximum profit can expressed as a\nfunction of price elasticity of demand and marginal cost (see\nAppendix).\nWe would like to remark that the proposed price strategy\nis well suited to the proposed system architecture because the\nBM-SC can quickly collect all the UE\u2019s whishes to receive a\nspecified service thanks to new answer message number 3 de-\nscribed in Section III.\nC. Application to the SDMB System\nIn our scenario the value represents the total transmission\ncost using the satellite broadcast capability, it is not function of\nquantity of the mobile users.\nThis can be evaluated using the following relation and it is re-\nlated to the cost for the satellite channel usage per second ,\nthe length of each multimedia SDMB service and the data\nrate for broadcasting transmission [12]; therefore, the\nfollowing equation represents the actual cost of the broadcast\nsatellite transmission\n(3)\nAfter the evaluation of the satellite broadcast cost, it is pos-\nsible to fix the price that each user would have to pay in order\nto obtain a good seller\u2019s profit.\nUsing relation (1) we know that the term TR (total revenue)\nis a function of the total number of users asking for an SDMB\nservice and the price that each user pay for the service (see the\nAppendix). The BM-SC can evaluate the total number of users\nbecause receive a message from each UE during the session\nstart phase as already explained; so the BM-SC is also able to\nevaluate the TR term in the equation choosing to reduce the\nservice price if the number of asking users is higher than the\nnumber of users required for having the hoped seller\u2019s profit.\nIn a more complex architecture, a non linear Price Adaptor\n(PA) joined to an \u201cutility function\u201d can be supported by the\nFig. 4. Discount\u2019s zones using PA.\nBM-SC module in order to manage a dynamic pricing strategy\ndepending on the amount of users asking for services.\nThe PA behavior can be based on the following consideration:\nthe satellite operator can decide to reduce the price service\nfor each users if the amount of users is enough for guaran-\nteeing a good seller\u2019s profit.\nthe price reduction can be obtained by the proposed fol-\nlowing equation:\n(4)\nwhere\n(5)\nand represents the reference selling price for each con-\nnection, is the number of users asking for a SDMB\nservice and W is a weight parameter that will be changed\nduring the simulation campaign in order to obtain a greater\ndiscount according to the amount of users.\nThe (4) also shows a fixed choice of the satellite seller that\ndecided to decrease the service price if the total revenue is at\nleast equal to double quantity of the satellite link cost ;\nobviously we fixed this threshold for our studies but it depends\non several business strategies and it can be modified inside the\nPA module.\nIn this last case, the total profit will be lower than the value\nobtained without the prices reduction, anyway, more users will\nbe attracted by the price\u2019s discount thus the total profit for the\nsatellite operator will be always greater than two time of the\nsatellite link cost.\nFig. 4 shows a simple and general graphic representation of\nthe PA working; represents the minimum threshold profit\nunder which every service provider cannot apply any type of\ndiscount. The normal system behavior without the price adaptor\nis shown by the oblique line that also represents the maximum\nprofit for the service provider; under this line there are several\nzones in which is possible to have a good profit applying the PA\ntechnique based on price\u2019s discount.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Seller\u2019s profit vs. number of users.\nAccording to these considerations, we propose in (5) a new\nmathematical relation for the estimation of the new discounted\nprice; clearly the term is a pseudo-linear function of several\nparameters as the old price , the total number of users and\nthe weight factor W. Moreover, from (4) and (5) it is directly\npossible to evaluate the term as a function of the total number\nof users, the weight factor W and the total production cost TC.\n(6)\nV. SIMULATION RESULTS\nIn our simulation campaign we perform a snapshot analysis\n(steady state) with maximum fixed number of MNOs (Mobile\nNetwork Operators) and users in each of them. In each snapshot\none multimedia SDMB service is delivered to the recipients in\nthe service area.\nThe service consists of delivery of a multimedia item that\nis characterized by its size in bits and number of recipi-\nents . Each mobile user has a terminal that is always on and\nable to connect simultaneously to both terrestrial-UMTS (uni-\ncast-broadcast) and Satellite (broadcast) systems. We only con-\nsider the downlink segment. The main simulation parameters\nare summarized in Table II.\nThe maximum number of simultaneously active users for\neach MNO has been chosen according the following considera-\ntion; looking at a country like Italy, we know that the population\nis about 58 millions and there are 4 different mobile network\noperators; considering an homogeneous user\u2019s distribution be-\ntween the operators with a user penetration rate of 0.85 we have\nabout 12 millions of subscribers for each mobile network [18].\nThe user penetration rate is defined as the ratio of the number\nof mobile users to the total population of a certain geographical\nTABLE II\nSIMULATION PARAMETERS\narea (e.g. a city area, a whole Country). Obviously, depending\non different day\u2019s time, it can be possible to have a different\nnumber of users that are active at the same time but the worst\ncase is about 25% of the total subscribers number. Supposing\nthat each mobile network is well designed for managing own\nsubscribers, the maximum number of active users has been\nchosen equal to 3 millions.\nIntroduction of multimedia services in mobile systems is\nimportant for mobile operators to maintain the Average Rev-\nenue Per User (ARPU) in the coming years, since voice service\nrevenues are expected to decrease over the next decade. Putting\nthe market into context, a recent report [19] forecasts 2006\nspending levels for mobile content at around $3.3 billion in\nEurope alone; according to this prevision, we present the re-\nsults obtained using the value 384 kbps for the parameter\nwithout loss of generality.\nFig. 5 shows how is possible to evaluate the total amount of\nprofit for the satellite operator varying the weight parameter\nand the number of users asking for the SDMB service. It is pos-\nsible to observe that when the number of users is small, there\nis no profit for the satellite operator; this observation is per-\nfectly agree with the use of satellite broadcast technology for\nproviding services to a big number of users in a wide area.\nWhen the number of users increases also the total seller\u2019s\nprofit increases in a linear way according to the first part of (4)\nthus, when the number of users is big enough, the module\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Price discount varying the W parameter\u2014C = 250.\nFig. 7. Price discount varying the W parameter\u2014C = 500.\ntries to apply the prices discount according to the second part of\nthe (4).\nGreat values of the parameter mean an high profit for the\nseller and a small discount for the single user as shown in Fig. 6.\nFor this reason the proposed approach is very general because\neach satellite operator can choose a suitable value for the W pa-\nrameter in its own price adapter module according to own need\nor business strategy, moreover, this parameter is very flexible\nand can be changed during the day or during some special pe-\nriods in order to increase the total profit if the amount of users\nasking for a SDMB service grows very quickly.\nFigs. 7 and 8 show how the price discount is also strictly re-\nlated to the parameter that represents the broadcast transmis-\nsion cost over the satellite link. It is possible to observe that when\nthe value of this parameter increases, the SDMB system needs to\nhave more users asking for an SDMB service in order to offer the\nsame discount. Actually, referring to the Fig. 8, we can note that\nif the parameter is too big, no discount can be offered to the\nusers when weight parameter is equal to 12. This is not an un-\ncommon behavior, it just means that even 10 millions of users are\nnot enough to satisfy the discount condition in (4) guaranteeing\nthat the total revenue for the satellite operator is at least equal to\ndouble quantity of the satellite link cost.\nAll the previous discussions demonstrate that the proposed\nmodel is very flexible and easily reconfigurable because it is\nbased on few system parameters that can be appraised by the\nsatellite operators.\nIn conclusion, the proposed price model is a very generic\nmodel adapted to the particular features of the MAESTRO\nsystem architecture in order to obtain good performances and\nattractive prices for the end mobile users; nevertheless, this\nmodel can be easily extended and personalized to the other\ntelecommunication systems through a careful tuning of its\nsimple parameters.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

CONCLUSIONS\nThis paper has proposed and tested a new effective Demand\nSensitive Model (DSM) in order to offer a price discount to the\nusers when the amount of users asking for an SDMB service\nis large enough to guarantee a desired profit for the satellite\noperator.\nThe conducted studies and the obtained results show how the\nnew parameter is very flexible and can be easily used for\ntuning the price discount, making the offered service more at-\ntractive for the end users and more profitable for the satellite\noperator.\nThere are many technology aspects that must be taken into ac-\ncount in future researches, such as quality of service, multi-di-\nmensional contracts, network mechanisms for conveying price\ninformation and the capabilities of edge devices to support new\ndynamic price models.\nAPPENDIX\nPRICE ELASTICITY OF DEMAND\nPrice elasticity of demand is the most commonly used mea-\nsure of consumers\u2019 sensitivity to price, pioneered by the great\nBritish economist Alfred Marshall [20], [21]. The price elas-\nticity of demand, is defined as the magnitude of:\n(7)\nwhere\nQuantity demanded\nprice per unit\nchange in quantity demanded\nchange in price per unit\nPrice elasticity examines the relationship between price and\nunit sales, thereby assuming that the other factors that influ-\nence demand remain unchanged. Since the quantity demanded\ndecreases when the price increases, this ratio is negative; how-\never, the absolute value usually is taken and is reported as\na positive number. Because the calculation uses proportionate\nchanges, the result is a unit less number and does not depend\non the units in which the price and quantity are expressed [22],\n[23] For demand-sensitive pricing model, price depends on the\nquantity demanded. In this case, quantity is independent while\nprice is dependant.\nFrom (2), marginal revenue can be expressed as\nusing the definition in (7), it is possible to write the marginal\nrevenue in the following way\nEquating with marginal cost yields the profit max-\nimizing relationship in terms of price and elasticity.\nSolving for selling price which maximizes profit yields\nThe difference between price and marginal cost is a gross\nprofit margin expressed as a percentage of prices.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.
