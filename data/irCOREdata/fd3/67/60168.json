Sewerage cover in particular is usually\nlow in many cities and towns of South and Southeast Asia, and as a consequence urban\nwastewaters are frequently discharged to the ground or to surface-water courses.  Many cities in\ndeveloping countries use groundwater for urban water supply.  However, shallow groundwater\nbeneath these cities is frequently contaminated, largely as a result of the disposal of urban wastes\nthat are rich in organic carbon and nitrogen.  As a consequence, shallow aquifers are often\nabandoned in favour of deeper ones.  Yet, pumping from these same deeper aquifers can impose\nsteep vertical hydraulic gradients and induce significant leakage from shallow units.   Incipient\ncontamination of deeper aquifers caused by induced downward leakage of shallow groundwater\nhas been observed in Hat Yai, Thailand (Lawrence et al. 1994) and in Leon, Mexico (Chilton et al.\n1998).\nHat Yai is the third largest city of Thailand, after Bangkok and Chiang Mai, with a municipal\npopulation of 157,062 in 1995, within an area of about 21 km2.  In common with many other\ncities in the region, it is expanding rapidly.  Hat Yai has a strategic location in the southern part of\nthe country near the Malaysian border as shown in Figure 1, and serves as a business, industrial,\nand tourist centre for the surrounding region.  The city is situated at an elevation of 5-10 m amsl\nin a low-lying valley that is bounded by low hills.  Two rivers, the Khlong U-Tao Phao and\nKhlong Toei, flow down the valley and through Hat Yai, where they receive large quantities of\nurban wastewater.\nThe area has consistently high temperatures throughout the year (the average annual temperature\nexceeds 27oC).  The total annual average rainfall is 1816 mm, with a distinct rainy season during\nOctober to December.  Evaporation rates are high; open-pan evaporation exceeds 1850 mm\/a.\nInfiltration to groundwater is about 170 mm\/a.\nThe objectives of this paper are to (1) demonstrate that for Hat Yai, downward leakage from\nbeneath the city provides a significant component of recharge to the semi-confined aquifer; (2)\ndescribe the evolution of water quality within the semi-confining unit beneath the city; and (3)\nconfirm that the timescales for this leakage to reach the underlying aquifer are of the order of\nseveral decades.\nGeology and Hydrogeology\nThe Hat Yai valley is underlain by a thick sequence of Quaternary and Recent alluvial sediments,\nwhich in turn rest upon Permian metasediments.  The valley is fault-bounded and the valley sides\nare composed of the Permian metasediments, which have been faulted up to form low but steep-\nsided hills.  The alluvial sediments within the valley have a thickness that locally exceeds 250 m,\nand they contain three major aquifer units.  These are named the Hat Yai aquifer, the Khu-Tao\naquifer and Kho-Hong aquifer;  they are at depths of 25-40 m, 45-80 m, and greater than 100 m,\nrespectively.  The aquifers consist of sand and\/or gravel and are separated by aquitards of poorly\npermeable fine sand, silt and clay (Ramnarong et al. 1984).\nHat Yai obtains about 50% of its urban water supply from groundwater.  Most of the groundwater\nabstraction is from the semi-confined Hat Yai aquifer.  Pumping is mostly from privately owned\nboreholes used to supply hotels and industry, which are largely concentrated within the city\ncentre.  The Hat Yai aquifer is overlain by about 30 m of relatively poorly permeable sand, silt,\nand clay.  In these upper less permeable deposits is a relatively shallow water table, which is\nmaintained by high urban recharge originating from the high rainfall combined with leaking water\nmains, infiltration from canals and seepage from on-site sanitation systems.\nBackground water quality in the Hat Yai aquifer is excellent; electrical conductivities are below\n50 \u00b5S\/cm and chloride is less than 10 mg\/L.  However, monitoring of groundwater quality in the\ncity centre has revealed elevated NH4 and Cl concentrations indicating incipient contamination as\nshown in Figure 2.  The main source of this contamination is believed to be seepage from canals,\nwhich receive the bulk of the urban wastewaters (Lawrence et al. 1994).  The use of canals for\ndisposal of urban wastewaters is a common practice in low-lying cities of Southeast Asia, where\nshallow water tables make infiltration from on-site sanitation systems difficult due to surfacing of\nthe effluent during monsoon periods.\nField Study\nA simple conceptual model of the groundwater system beneath the city was proposed as displayed\nin Figure 3.  The model suggests that downward leakage is greatest beneath the city centre where\nabstraction is also at a maximum.  The shallow groundwater beneath the city centre is assumed to\nbe polluted.  The coincidence of maximal leakage with the area where shallow groundwater is\nassumed to be most contaminated has serious implications for the future water quality in the\ndeeper aquifer.\nA field programme was designed to gain more information on the upper aquitard layer, including\nthe lithology, vertical head gradients, and water chemistry in order to test this model.  Piezometers\nwere installed in groups of three at five sites across the city to depths of 10, 15, and 24 m.  The\nlocations of each of these sites is shown in Figure 4.  Each piezometer was screened with PVC\ncasing that was slotted over the last two metres and sealed at the bottom with a PVC cap.  The\npiezometers were completed with a gravel pack and sealed at the surface with bentonite.\nUnfortunately the deepest borehole at site GPH3-4 became contaminated with bentonite during\nwell completion and as a consequence no groundwater data is presented for this piezometer.\nDuring the drilling of the piezometers, an attempt was made to collect cores for pore-water\nanalysis.  The local geology is quite variable, with layers of sand interbedded with clay.  By a\ncombination of augering through the clay and percussion drilling through the more consolidated\nsand, reasonable core recovery was obtained.  The maximum cored depth was 16 m; the minimum\nwas just 8 m.  Once removed from the ground, the core was split longitudinally into two\nsegments, transferred to plastic bags, sealed, and then stored at 4(C.  One half of the core was\nretained for microbial determinations carried out locally, the other was shipped to the UK for pore-\nwater extraction.  Pore-waters were extracted by centrifugation (Edmunds and Bath 1976) and the\nresulting water was analysed for various cations and anions.\nOn completion of the drilling, water samples were obtained with a small submersible pump from\nall 15 piezometers.  Unstable parameters (pH, redox potential, dissolved oxygen and alkalinity)\nwere determined at the well head.  Filtered water samples were returned to the UK for major- and\ntrace- element analysis.  In addition, samples were taken at carefully selected sites along the canal\nand also returned to the UK for the same analytical suite.  The analytical chemistry procedures\nused are described elsewhere in Gooddy et al. (1995).\n At three sites, devices for automatic water-level monitoring were installed to observe and record\nthe vertical head differences with depth.  Hydraulic testing of the piezometers was carried out at\nthree of the five sites to characterise the upper confining layer.  Falling-head tests and short\npumping tests were performed on all three piezometers at each of the sites, and the data were\nrecorded using automatic loggers (Gooddy et al. 1997).  Data were analysed to obtain the\npermeability of the confining layer over the depth screened in each piezometer.  After the testing,\ngroundwater-level loggers were installed at the three sites as a system for long-term groundwater\nmonitoring; groundwater levels were measured hourly.\nResults\nHydrogeology\nThe results of the drilling broadly confirmed the conceptual model and showed that the aquitard\nconsists of an upper, relatively more permeable, layer of clayey sand overlying a less permeable\nsilty clay.  Water levels in the piezometers confirmed the existence of a downward vertical head\ngradient that approaches 1 in 2 towards the city centre (Figure 4).  The daily water level response\nin the piezometers (especially the deeper ones) to pumping from the Hat Yai aquifer is shown\nin Figure  5, and the close correspondence of the responses at the different piezometers confirms\nthe hydraulic connectivity through the aquitard.  An  estimate of vertical hydraulic conductivity\nwas made from these results, and the value is consistent with the values obtained in the hydraulic\ntests and that used in modeling.  Vertical permeabilities are greater near the top of the aquitard,\nwhere drilling indicated that the sediment is more sandy.\nHorizontal permeabilities were obtained from falling-head tests and pumping tests.  The results\nindicate that horizontal permeability decreases with depth within the aquitard, and this is in\nagreement with the lithologies observed while drilling.  Values of permeability obtained are very\nsimilar for the various sites; permeabilities of 1-5 m\/d were measured at a depth of 10 m bgl, 0.4-\n0.6 m\/d at a depth of 15 m bgl, and lower values of 0.01-0.05 m\/d at depths of 23 m bgl.  The\neffective vertical permeability of the confining layer, for the purposes of estimating vertical\nleakage, is dominated by material with the lowest permeability through which water must pass,\nand vertical permeabilities are usually about an order of magnitude less than horizontal\npermeabilities.  Thus vertical permeabilities probably range from 0.1-0.5 m\/d in the upper part of\nthe semi-confining unit and closer to 0.001-0.005 m\/d in the less permeable part of the semi-\nconfining unit.\nHydrochemistry\nA summary of results from the pumped groundwaters from the peizometers is shown in Table 1.\nThese data show that beneath the city groundwaters are contaminated with elevated\nconcentrations of ammonia (nearly 20 mg\/L as N), chloride (more than 60 mg\/L), and dissolved\norganic carbon (3.7 mg\/L).  Only in the deeper piezometers located near the edge of the city do\ngroundwater concentrations approach background values (Figure 6) with the chloride\nconcentration falling to below 3 mg\/L and sodium and potassium following a similar pattern.\nBicarbonate concentrations are highest beneath the city centre and decrease with increasing depth\nand increasing distance from the centre ranging from more than 200 mg\/L at the most\ncontaminated sites to less than 10 mg\/L at the least contaminated.  Similarly iron and manganese\nshow very high concentrations (up to 28 mg\/L and 1.9 mg\/L respectively) beneath the city centre\nbut decrease by two orders of magnitude in the deepest borehole at the city limits. Concentrations\nof dissolved organic carbon are relatively enhanced in the canals (Table 1) ranging from 4.5 \u2013\n16.7 mg\/L and are high in the pore-waters as shown in Figure 7, with a maximum concentration\nof 47 mg\/L near the surface and a peak of 35 mg\/L at 8 metres below the surface.  These values\nare high, although not as high as those in more arid climates (Ronen and Margaritz 1985).  These\nfindings are consistent with the concept that the canal water in Hat Yai contains domestic\nwastewater and is recharging the shallow aquitard.\nHydrochemical Evolution\nIn contaminated groundwater bodies, abiotic or biologically mediated chemical transformations of\norganic compounds are closely linked with the local geochemical environment.  The overall\nfavorability of specific degradation pathways depends upon prevailing redox conditions in terms\nof the availability of electron acceptors\/donors and the presence of suitable microorganisms.  In\nturn, the transformation of significant quantities of organic compounds may feed back to impact\ngroundwater chemistry in terms of aqueous speciation (particularly redox-active species), pH, and\nthe saturation states of various mineral phases (Lee and Bennett 1998 ).  The results are discussed\nin the framework of groundwater quality deteriorating as urbanisation occurs rapidly, and relate to\nthe different locations within the aquitard and the principal chemical processes controlling the\nwater quality. With a highly complex and variable contaminant source such as a wastewater canal\nand changes in the local geology many geochemical reactions are occurring in the shallow\nsubsurface environment and the equations presented are merely to represent the type of reactions\nthat are taking place and are certainly not definitive.\nIn the unconfined phreatic aquifer, which has a very shallow water table, the data show that\ndissolved oxygen is largely absent.  Because virtually no unsaturated zone exists, the little oxygen\nthat was available (especially compared with many unconfined aquifers) is consumed during the\noxidation of the organic matter (1):\nCH2O + O2 ( CO2 + H2O                                                                               (1)\nWhen oxygen is the electron acceptor, carbon dioxide is produced resulting in the formation of\ncarbonic acid that reacts with carbonate minerals.  That is, when oxygen is in the system the\ngeochemistry is controlled primarily by carbonate equilibrium (2-4):\nH2O + CO2 ( H2CO3                                                                                      (2)\nH2CO3 ( H+ + HCO3-                                                                         (3)\nHCO3- ( H+ + CO32-                                                                                       (4)\nBase cation concentrations (primarily calcium and magnesium) in the groundwater are very low\n(typically less than 20 mg\/L for calcium and 2 mg\/L for magnesium).  This condition probably\nreflects the evolution of groundwater beneath the city.  During initial stages of urbanisation,\nleakage from septic tanks and the canals may have occurred, but sufficient oxygen was still\npresent to enable nitrification (5):\nNH4+ + 2O2 ( NO3- + 2H+ +H2O                                                                   (5)\nIn poorly buffered sediments, the addition of protons is buffered primarily by the alkalinity of the\nmatrix.  Where concentrations of aqueous base cations are low either little nitrification is taking\nplace or the source of base cations has already been depleted.  Pore-water profiles for most sites\nshow high calcium concentrations (up t o 250 mg\/L) for the upper few metres of the profile,\nsuggesting that some nitrification is taking place in the very shallow unsaturated zone where\noxygen should still be available.  In contrast, at depth the calcium source, together with oxygen,\nhas been largely removed during the earlier evolution of the system.  An example is given in\nFigure 7.  Therefore, beneath the water table, dissolved oxygen is rapidly depleted and other ions\ntake over as terminal electron acceptors and include nitrate, manganese, iron, and sulphate.  When\nthese electron acceptors are used bicarbonate is produced without generating acidity, and without\nsignificant carbonate dissolution (6-8):\n5CH2O + 4NO3- ( 2N2 + 2HCO3- + CO2 + 3H2O                                         (6)\nCH2O + 3Fe(OH)3  ( HCO3- + 3Fe2+ + 4OH- + 3H2O                                  (7)\n2CH2O + SO42- ( H2S + 2HCO3-                                                                   (8)\nBeneath the city centre, concentrations of ammonia and iron in the shallow groundwater are\ngreatest, and redox potential is at its lowest, all consistent with iron and sulphate as the electron\nacceptors.  Reaction 7 results in an increase in dissolved ferrous iron and bicarbonate but also\nresults in the production of hydroxide; hence, the pH increases.  This condition is observed in the\nmost contaminated sites beneath the city centre; these sites have much greater concentrations of\niron and bicarbonate and a higher pH than the least contaminated site.  Farther away from the city\ncentre, the redox potential is higher and manganese and nitrate dominate as electron acceptors.\nThe upper 2-3 m of the porewater profiles represents the unsaturated zone and, below this in the\nsaturated zone, pore-water iron concentrations begin to increase as conditions become more\nreducing.  The relatively low concentrations of iron and nitrate in the upper few metres and the\npresence of ammonia (Figure 7) could indicate pyrite oxidation (to reduce the oxidation state of\niron) (9), followed by nitrate reduction (10):\n5FeS2 + 14NO3- + 4H+ ( 7N2 + 5Fe2+ + 10SO4 + 2H2O                               (9)\n10Fe2+ + 2NO3- +14H2O ( 10FeOOH + N2 +18H+                           (10)\nThis reaction  generates a large number of protons that would require buffering.\nAlternatively the high concentration of ammonia and low concentrations of nitrate may indicate\nanother possible way of denitrification (11):\nNO3- + H2O + 2CH2O ( NH4+ + 2HCO3-                                                      (11)\nThe profile also contains high concentrations of manganese, although iron reduction is the\ndominant electron acceptor process in the upper 10 m.  Below this depth, sulphate concentrations\ndecline rapidly as sulphate reduction commences.  Iron concentrations also decrease as iron\nsulphides are formed and precipitated. At the most contaminated sites, evidence for sulphate\nreduction from the depleted sulphate concentrations exists is the form of black sulphide deposits\non the interior of the piezometer casing and an odour of hydrogen sulphide.  These zones have\nyielded groundwater with arsenic concentrations up to 1 mg\/L (one hundred times the value of the\nWHO recommended limit, WHO (1995)).  Arsenic is likely to be naturally present in the rock\nmatrix as arsenopyrite or adsorbed to ferric hydroxides.\nCriteria for redox parameters that could be used for assigning redox status to groundwater samples\naffected by landfill leachate based on redox-sensitive compounds have previously been developed\nby Lyngkilde and Christensen (1992).  They recognised that although electrochemical\ndetermination of redox potentials is mechanically very simple, it often yields results which are\ndifficult to interpret or in some cases misleading.  Identifying redox zones is very important in\nterms of understanding pollutant fate in a contaminant plume (Gooddy et al. 1998).  The criteria\nused for the groundwater beneath Hat Yai., which are similar to those used by Lyngkilde and\nChristensen are presented in Table 2.\nMicrobially mediated methane generation in groundwater in general proceeds by either reduction\nof carbon dioxide or fermentation of organic carbon (Appelo and Postma 1993).  Methane\nformation involving organic sources may be approximated by (12):\n2CH2O ( CH4 + CO2                                                                          (12)\nAlthough no direct measurements were made for methane the presence of a methanogenic zone\nhas been inferred from the redox criteria used.\nFigure 8 shows a cross section across the city form South to North with the redox zones indicated.\nThe large range observed for most of the parameters within each redox status shows the wide span\nof groundwater samples belonging to the same group.  Average values reveal that the redox status\nis closely correlated to the pollution level.  Conditions are most reducing beneath the city centre,\nwhere methanogenic\/sulphidogenic conditions extend to a depth of at least 24 m.  A slight skew\nexists in the redox conditions toward the northern end of the city, possibly due to limited lateral\nmovement from the canal.  The environment becomes less reducing both with distance from the\ncity centre along the canal and with distance from the canal.  The highest DOC concentrations\noccur at the most contaminated sites, implying that a build-up of organic carbon occurs as\nterminal electron acceptors are sequentially consumed.\nDiscussion\nGroundwater abstraction from the semi-confined Hat Yai aquifer has produced steep vertical head\ngradients within the aquitard.  Substantial downward leakage is possible, even though the\npermeability determined for the aquitard is relatively low. A simple analytical model was\ndeveloped to describe vertical leakage beneath Hat Yai city (Barker and Lawrence 1994).   The\nmodel results indicate that the vertical permeability of the aquitard is about 0.002 m\/d.  The model\nand field values are therefore in reasonable agreement.\nThe water-quality data presented provide strong evidence for the significant reduction in redox\npotential of the groundwater in the aquitard as a result of the seepage of water high in organic\ncarbon from the canals.  This appears to be an evolving process, with the most reducing\ngroundwaters occurring beneath the city centre close to where seepage is greatest.  These strongly\nreducing groundwaters will probably spread outward with time.  The change in redox potential is\nsignificant, because it produces changes in the quality of groundwater in the aquitard by\nmobilising redox-sensitive elements.  Evidence already exists that these shallow groundwaters in\nthe aquitard are producing changes to water quality in the underlying Hat Yai aquifer as a direct\nresult of pumping induced leakage (Lawrence et al. 1994).\nThe front of polluted groundwater within the aquitard has \u2019broken through\u2019 into the aquifer within\na radial distance of less than 1 km of the city centre.  From Figure 6 it can be seen that a\ncomparison of the front position with modeled travel-time fronts suggests that the front originated\nfrom recharge 30-35 years ago.  Since Hat Yai expanded rapidly in the 1960s and 1970s this\ntimeframe is quite reasonable and provides validation of the model.  These time scales of 30-\n35 years to migrate through the aquitard have important implications, because whereas monitoring\nof groundwater in the semi-confined aquifers shows no pollution, this result may simply be\nbecause the pollution front has not migrated through the aquitard.  Once the front has broken\nthrough, pollution would spread out radially through the aquifer unless vertical gradients can be\nreversed, which would be extremely difficult to achieve in practice.  Likewise, whereas removal\nof organic loading at the surface would have beneficial effects in the longer term, it would take\ndecades for the better quality shallow water to flush through to the aquifer.\nA special concern is the very high concentrations of arsenic in the shallow groundwater; the\narsenic could originate from oxidation of sulphide minerals or desorption from iron oxides. The\nrelationship between arsenic and sulphate is shown in Figure 9.  The presence of reducing\nconditions and sulphide precipitation on the borehole casing implies that active sulphide oxidation\nis not occurring.  Therefore arsenic mobility is probably controlled by desorption from iron oxide\nphases followed by some reprecipitation of sulphides as redox moves from oxidizing to reducing\nconditions.  In the most reducing environments dissolution of arsenic occurs at a greater rate than\nits removal from solution by sulphide precipitation, hence, very high concentrations are observed\nin the groundwater.\nThe addition of organic materials has not only facilitated some chemical reactions but greatly\naccelerated others.  Previous studies have noted that under certain conditions, organo-metallic\ncomplexes have enhanced mobility in aquifer systems (Christensen et al. 1996).  This has not\nbeen observed in the study area, possibly due to the moderate organic carbon concentrations in the\ngroundwater.  However, a potential problem would develop if DOC concentrations start to rise.\nPore-water profiles reveal considerable depletion in base cations, reflecting the geochemical\nevolution of the unsaturated zone as conditions became more reducing.  Any future addition of\nprotons could have a serious impact on the pH of the environment.  Toxic metals such as copper,\nzinc, and aluminium, which may be present in the aquifer matrix or in wastewater, are more\nsoluble at a lower pH and may therefore compound the contamination problem.\nConclusions\nRapid urbanisation can and often does lead to widespread contamination of shallow groundwater\nand to its abandonment for potable supply in favour of deeper more protected aquifers.  Rapid\nurban growth has led to a parallel expansion of groundwater abstraction and to significant changes\nto the groundwater flow system.  Such changes in flow patterns can have important consequences\non both the quality and sustainability of the resource.  Although semi-confined aquifers are less\nsusceptible to contamination from activities at the surface, heavy abstraction can produce large\nvertical gradients in the semi-confining (or leaky) layer and induce substantial downward leakage\nfrom the shallow layers.  In the longer term, this condition can produce significant changes to\nwater quality.\nIn Hat Yai, the combination of high organic content of the urban recharge and the shallow depth\nto the water table has produced strongly reducing conditions in the upper layer.  These conditions\nhave led to elevated concentrations of ammonium (but low nitrate) and bicarbonate together with\nthe mobilisation of iron, manganese, and arsenic.  These redox-induced changes to water quality\nappear to be of greater significance than the contamination that has been introduced.  The\ntimescales for downward leakage, from the surface through the upper aquitard to the semi-\nconfined aquifer, are of the order of several decades, and incipient contamination of the semi-\nconfined aquifer has only recently become apparent.  This conclusion has important implications\nfor groundwater monitoring and demonstrates the need, in semi-confined aquifers, to monitor\nwithin the upper leaky layer, especially where early warnings of future changes in water quality\nare required.\nAcknowledgments\nThis study was funded by the Overseas Development Administration (formerly ODA now DFID) under\nproject R5975.
