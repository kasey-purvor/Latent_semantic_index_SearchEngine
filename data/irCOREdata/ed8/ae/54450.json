INTRODUCTION1\nDue to increases in air pollution in congested cities, as \nwell as decreases in fuel efficiency for car usage in these \nareas (i.e. traffic jams, stop lights, average speed, etc.) the \npotential of small urban cars with alternative, low carbon \nemission energy sources and drive train topologies have \nbeen heavily investigated in recent years.  \nThe urban vehicle under consideration here is shown\nin Fig. 1, viz. all-electric (EV) prototype version of the \nsmart car (a brand of Daimler Chrysler). The drive train, \nFig. 2, designed by Zytek Electric Vehicles Ltd., is driven \nby a 55kW (75Hp peak) permanent magnet brushless DC\nmachine (BLDC) and supplied from an IGBT power \ninverter via a 26kW (36Hp) Zebra battery module, \nproviding a  DC bus voltage of \u2248300V.   \nThe progression of the EV and the hybrid electric \nvehicles (HEV) from prototype to commercial \navailability has been limited primarily by the deficiencies \nin current alternative energy storage technologies. These \ninclude high cost, limited life span and low energy\ndensity when compared with the internal combustion (IC) \nengine and carbon based fuel.  Moreover, in recent years, \nwith the availability of high-power silicon devices and \nadvances in electrical machine design, such limitations \nhave become more critical in hindering the successful \ndevelopment of the alternative energy approach, \nparticularly for the EV.  As a result, therefore, a\ncompromise, i.e. the HEV (two energy sources, one of \nwhich is often a battery) solution has been the \nmainstream. However, such solutions, particularly for the \nurban vehicle market are usually complex, expensive, and \n                                                          \nThe authors acknowledge the financial support of the UK \nDepartment of Trade and Industry (DTI) and contributions of the project \npartners, Zytek Electric Vehicles Ltd., Beta Research and Development \nLtd. and MIRA. \nfor most driving cycles do not improve fuel economy or \nreduce emissions significantly over a small, well-\ndesigned IC engine. \nFig. 1. All-electric smart car \nFig. 2. Drive-train topology \nThe Zebra battery module, Fig. 3, has been previously \nutilised successfully in prototype EVs, such as the BMW \nE1 [1] and Mercedes-Benz 'A'-class as well as \nelectric\/hybrid public transportation buses in California \nand Italy. Additionally, Rolls Royce has selected the \ntechnology to replace lead-acid in military and rescue \nsurface and submersible ship applications. It therefore \npromises to be a viable competitive energy storage \nsolution for EV applications, with several added \nadvantages over other battery technologies. For instance, \na typical Zebra module [2,3], exhibits a high energy \ndensity of 120Wh\/kg 3-4 times higher than lead-acid and \n2-3 times nickel-metal hydride [4]. The pulse power\ncapability is also adequate for typical electric vehicles \nacceleration profiles, at around 1.5 the rated energy \n(170W\/kg). Zebra cells also offer significantly increased \ncycle life \u22483500 nameplate cycles (7-8 times higher than \nlead-acid), maintenance free operation, unaffected by \nambient temperatures, no gassing, zero self-discharge and \nZebra Battery Technologies for the All Electric \nSmart Car \nT.

Of \nparticular importance to EV applications, state of charge \nestimation is also simple to evaluate since the cell are \n100% coulombically efficient i.e. Ah charge in = Ah\ndischarge out. \nFig. 3. Typical Zebra module \nIndividual Zebra cells operate within a specified \ntemperature range of 270-350\u00b0C (as discussed in the next \nsection). Series and parallel chains are interconnected and \npackaged within a sealed, vacuum insulated, air-cooled \nmodular casing, Fig. 3, to minimise heat loss to the \nenvironment. The module is regulated by a dedicated\nbattery management unit (BMI) attached to the front. The \nBMI is fully automated, controlling the charging, \nmaximum and minimum terminal voltages during \nloading, charge status and thermal management by \nregulating internal heaters and fan cooling. However, in \ngeneral use, once operating temperatures are reached, the \ninternal temperature of the module is self-regulating, \nexhibiting a natural cooling of around -3\u00b0C\/hour (if left \nunconnected to an external power supply). Additionally, \nthe module can remain within specified temperature \nlimits during a one hour discharge rate without additional \nforced air cooling. Furthermore, after a sustained drive \ncycle, heat can be absorbed during the charging period \n(i.e. heat can be either evolved or absorbed during\ncharging).   \nThe relatively simple smart EV drive train, Fig. 2, has \ntherefore become an increasingly viable solution when \ncombined with a Zebra module, being particularly well \nsuited for around 80% of all urban vehicle trips, i.e. short-\ndistance, high-use applications within 50-100 mile \nranges. However, due to the complex nature, and recent \ndevelopment of the Zebra cell, there have been few \nequivalent models to predict its performance in \napplications such as EVs. To date therefore, much EV \nprototyping has been on a trial and error basis with time \nconsuming experimental evaluation prohibiting an \noptimal solution and slowing progression.  Furthermore, \nthere have been limited publications that clearly \ndemonstrate the potential of this relatively new \ntechnology. \nII.  ZEBRA BATTERY EQUIVALENT CIRCUIT\nThe purpose of this section is to explore the main \nelectrochemical behaviour within the Zebra cell and\nformulate an equivalent electrical circuit representation.  \nFig. 4. Simplified chemical reactions within the Zebra cell during \ndischarging \nFigure 4 illustrates the Zebra cell showing (a) the main \ncomponents of the cell and (b) an enlarged portion. The \ncentral solid positive (+ve) electrode consists of a nickel \nconductor (current collector) surrounded by a mixture of \nnickel chloride (NiCl2), nickel (Ni) and liquid electrolyte \n(enabling the transfer of Na+ within the +ve electrode). \nThe negative (-ve) electrode constitutes the metal cell \ncasing and molten sodium (Na). Both electrodes are \nseparated via a solid ceramic electrolyte which facilitates \nthe conduction of Na+ ions between the reaction partners, \nsodium and nickel chloride. It also has the property of \nsimultaneously acting as an insulator for electrons. The \ncell requires high temperatures to liquefy the sodium and \nensure the internal resistance is minimised. The \nmaximum temperature is dictated by the maximum \nallowable level of internal cell pressure.  \nDuring discharging, as illustrated by the events in Fig. \n4, sodium reacts with nickel chloride to form sodium \nchloride (salt) and nickel. This process is reversed during \ncharging and is given by (1).  \n(1) \nVariation of internal resistance is mainly attributed to \nthe behaviour of the solid +ve electrode (a characteristic \nfeature of Zebra cells). During the course of discharging, \nthe reaction front migrates inwards towards the central \ncurrent collector, as illustrated in Fig. 4. This migration \nNa\nNaCl\n+Ni NiCl2\nAlso contains \nliquid electrolyte  \n(a) Zebra cell (b) Enlarged internal portion  \n+ve electrode  -ve electrode \n+ve current \ncollector  \n-ve \ncase  \nLayer radius \nDischarged \narea \nSolid ceramic \nelectrolyte\nReaction \nfront \n0 1 \nCharged \narea \nRoute of \nsodium \nions\n+ve Current \ncollector  \nBMI \nAir inlet\/outlets \n2Na + NiCl2  2NaCl + Ni  \nDischarge \nCharging \n-ve Cell \ncase \nS34 - 7\n \nincreases the overall internal resistance of the +ve \nelectrode since the reaction front is reduced, and the \npropagation distance of the Na+ ions is increased. It can \nbe seen therefore that the +ve electrode of a fully charged \ncell contains only NiCl2, whilst a fully discharged cell \ncontains only NaCl and Ni. The concept of reaction front \nis normalised and termed layer radius Sr. When Sr=0 the \nreaction front is directly adjacent to the central current \ncollector and when Sr=1 adjacent to the sold ceramic \nelectrolyte.  \nDuring charging, a second charged area (NiCl2 layer) \nis formed immediately adjacent to the solid ceramic\nelectrolyte, irrespective of the depth of discharge (DOD) \nor the radius of the previous reaction front. Hence, after a \nshort charge, the layer radius is identical to that of a fully \ncharged cell. It follows therefore, that during a \nsubsequent discharge, the cell exhibits a low internal \nresistance as it depletes the recently charged outermost \nlayer. Once depleted, the reaction front (or layer radius) \nreturns to the previous position before the charge was \ninitiated. Such an event subsequently causes non-linear \nstep terminal voltages during a driving cycle, creating the \naccumulation of many layers. As a result, the Zebra cell \ncannot be accurately described as a function of charge \nstate, as with other cell types.   \nThe above electrochemical processes can be simplified \nand represented as an equivalent electrical circuit of a cell \nas illustrated in Fig. 5. Vterm and Iterm are the terminal \nvoltage and current, respectively, and UNi is the open \ncircuit voltage (OCV) representing the electrochemical \npotential of sodium and nickel chloride. The passive \nelectrical components consist of RNi, the lumped ohmic \nresistance of the solid ceramic electrolyte and \ninterconnecting metal, RNit, the resistance of the +ve \nelectrode, and CNit, a capacitance which simulates the \ndiffusion processes within the +ve electrode. However, \nthis circuit which is termed the nickel cell cannot\nadequately represent the newest generation of Zebra cells \nwhich also contain iron doping of the positive electrode. \nThe doping forms a second sodium\/iron cell (Na\/FeCl2) \nthat takes part in the reaction directly adjacent to the solid \nceramic electrolyte and constitutes approximately 20% of \nthe total energy capacity in the most recent cells.  \nTo simulate the parallel supposition of the two \nindividual cells, the circuit of Fig. 5 is expanded in Fig. 6 \nwhere RFe and UFe, represent the lumped iron cell \nresistance and OCV respectively. The iron cell only\ncontributes to Iterm during a high power pulse discharge \nwhen the Vterm falls below UFe, thereby enhancing the \npulse power capability (when compared with an undoped \ncell). Immediately commencing a high power pulse \ndischarge when Vterm increases above UFe, the iron cell is \nrecharged by via the nickel cell. Current flow during this \nevent is illustrated by the dotted line in Fig. 6. \nThe level of iron doping is carefully prescribed, \nrepresenting a trade-off based on performance and cost. \nIron is cheaper than nickel and improves pulse power \ncapability. However, an increase in iron reduces the \ncapacity of the higher voltage nickel cell thereby \ninfluencing nameplate performance towards the end of \nDOD, when the capacity of the nickel cell has depleted. \nFig. 5. Electrical circuit representation of a Zebra cell \nFig. 6. Electric circuit representation of an iron doped Zebra cell \nIn general, both the liquid and ceramic electrolyte\nexhibit increased ion conductivity with elevated cell \ntemperatures which has the effect of reducing impedance \nof the +ve electrode. Furthermore the OCV is also \ninfluenced by temperature variation. The dependences of \nthe individual elements of the equivalent electrical circuit \non additional parameters are assumed as follows [5]: \n\u2022 OCV has a dependence on charge state (DOD) \nand temperature only. \n\u2022 CNit, RNit, and RNi are not dependant on DOD but \nshow dependency on the current layer radius and \ntemperature. Furthermore they exhibit different \nvalues for charging and discharging. \n\u2022 RFe, has shown dependency on current layer \nradius and the DOD of the iron cell (DOD_Fe). \nTemperature dependence is small and ignored.  \nRNit\nCNit\nRNi\nUNi Vterm\n+ve electrode \nresistance \nSolid ceramic electrolyte \nMetal resistance\nLayer radius \nSr \n0 1 \nR\nes\nist\nan\nce\n\u22482.58V \nIterm\n(b) Equivalent circuit \n(a) Simplified components of cell impedance \nRFe \nRNit\nCNit\nRNi\nUNi\nVterm\nUFe \n\u22482.58V \n\u22482.35V \nIFe \nINi\nIterm\nCharging iron cell \nS34 - 8\n \nFig. 7. Schematic of the Zebra battery model structure. \nIII.  ZEBRA BATTERY MODEL\nThe model is based entirely on a single cell \nrepresentation, which is scaled to simulate the \ninterconnection of series and parallel chains. Figure 7 \nillustrates schematically the model structure which is \nimplemented in a Simulink\u00ae modelling environment. \nThe equivalent electric circuit model, Fig. 6, forms the \ncore and is evaluated for each simulation step as a\nconventional linear (time invariant) circuit. However, for \neach step, the equivalent circuit parameters are modified \nbased on the assumptions outlined in the previous section \nin accordance with variations in Sr, DOD, terminal \ncurrent direction and battery temperature, obtained via an \nauxiliary thermal model. Of particular importance, the \nprior history, location and capacity (in Ah) of previously \ncharged layers are stored. Outermost, charged layers are \ndepleted first by initiating step changes in the current \nlayer radius. The BMI is modelled based on the actual \nunit, enforcing voltage\/current limits and monitoring state \nof charge etc. Model accuracy is determined by the \nestimated equivalent circuit parameters with respect to a \ngiven operating condition. Parameters are identified via \nterminal voltage data at discrete points and the model \nperforms interpolation between adjacent values.  \nExperiments where preformed on a 10 cell series chain \nmodule, containing the most recent ML\/8P 25Ah cells, \n(intended for use in future EV smart cars). The module \nhas a nominal OCV of 25.8V. Figure 8 shows terminal\nvoltage progression when the module is subjected to a \nrepeating pulse discharge sequence of 60min at 2.5A, \n30sec at 12.5A followed by 30min open circuit. Notably \nthese results where performed at a fixed temperature \n(295\u00b0C) and the module was previously fully charged \n(i.e. contains no previous charged layers) and completely \ndischarged within the loading sequence.  \n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\nx 104\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\nFig. 8. Terminal voltage progression during a pulse discharge \nsequence \nFrom the data in Fig. 8 the OCV as a function of DOD \ncan be obtained as well as equivalent circuit parameters \nfor the nickel cell as a function of layer radius. Notably, \nsimilar experiments were repeated at different \ntemperatures employing both charging and discharging \nload sequences. One of the voltage transients during a \n12.5A pulse in Fig. 8 (marked) is enlarged and shown in \nFig. 9 alongside the method for calculating the nickel cell \nresistances. The capacitance is determined from the time \nconstant \u03c4, by curve matching the transient part of the \npulse. \n In order to ensure the iron cell is not contributing to \nthe terminal current (resulting in error of the estimated \nnickel cell resistances) the terminal voltage must be kept \nabove \u224823.5V. Unfortunately voltages below 23.5V are \nan inevitable occurrence at high DOD, since the nickel \ncell capacity is depleted, and the terminal current consists \nonly of the iron cell contribution.

Enlarged high power transient terminal voltage pulse \nThe iron cell resistance can be estimated as a function \nof DOD_Fe by subjecting the module to a high power \npulse discharge sequence of 60min at 2.5A, 30sec at\nmaximum current followed by 30min open circuit. The\nvoltage progression is shown in Fig. 10, where the \nminimum terminal voltage is governed by the BMI and\nset at 0.66 nominal OCV (17.2V).  One of the voltage \ntransients during a maximum current pulse shown in Fig \n10 (marked) is enlarged in Fig. 11, alongside a method \nfor calculating the iron cell resistance during charging \nand discharging events. It should be noted that based on \nthis method, the accuracy of the estimate iron cell\nresistance is entirely based on the accuracy of the\npreviously estimated nickel resistances.  \nFigure 12 shows the estimated resistive circuit \nparameters as a function of layer radius during \ndischarging at 295\u00b0C. It can be seen that the nickel cell \nresistances appear to sharply fall, whilst the iron cell \nresistance rises when Sr<0.3. The anomaly is due to the \ndifficulty in determining the nickel cell parameters with \nincreased DOD. Although this does not affect the \naccuracy of the model, it does not represent the likely \nprogression of actual resistances, which has been added \nfor clarity. Additionally from Fig. 12, it can be seen that \nwhen the layer radius is large and the +ve electrode \nexhibits minimum resistance, the current contribution of \nthe iron cell is small, since its equivalent resistance is \nhigh. As the layer radius reduces the iron resistance \nreduces significantly. This has the effect of increasing the \ncurrent contribution of the iron cell and counteracting the \neffects of the higher nickel cell resistances as the layer \nradius reduces (i.e. the cell maintains good pulse power \ncapability at high DOD levels). For completeness, Fig. 13 \nshows an example of the estimated OCV as a function of \nDOD.  \n0.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.9\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\nFig. 12.

Estimated and scaled smart car power requirements during a \nNEDC driving cycle \nIn order to evaluate the performance of the Zebra \nbattery model an ECE+EDDC (NEDC) driving cycle is \nemployed as a benchmark. Using data from the smart car \ndrive train, a demand power profile was estimated over \none NEDC cycle and scaled, Fig 14, to suit the 10 cell \nexperimental Zebra module. Figures 15 and 16 show both \nthe simulated and experimental results for the terminal \nvoltage and terminal current progression throughout the \ncycle.  \nIV.  CONCLUSIONS\nThis paper describes the operational behaviour and \nadvantages of the high temperature, Zebra battery, for use \nin all electric urban vehicles. It is shown that an\nequivalent parallel electrical circuit can be employed to \naccurately simulate the electrochemical behaviour \ninherent in the most recent generation of Zebra cells. The \nexperimental procedure is outlined and summary \nattributes of the investigation validated by both \nsimulation studies, and experimentally, via measurements \nfrom a prototype battery module intended for use in a all \nelectric smart car and benchmark NEDC urban driving\ncycle. It is demonstrated that the transient behaviour \nduring charging and discharging can be predicted with \nsufficient accuracy to optimise the smart car drive train \nwithout time consuming experimental trials. \nV.
