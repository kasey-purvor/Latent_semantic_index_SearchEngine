In practice, setting that price can be extremely difficult as \nuncertainties abound. There is often uncertainty not just about individual parameters but about \nthe structure of the problem and how to model it. A further complication is the second-best nature \nof real environmental policy making. In this paper, we propose some practical steps for setting \nprices in the face of these difficulties, drawing on the example of climate change. We consider how \nto determine the overall target for environmental protection, how to set shadow prices to deliver \nthat target, and how we can learn from the performance of policies to revise targets and prices. \nPerhaps most significantly, we suggest that estimates of the marginal cost of environmental \nprotection, rather than the marginal benefit, will often provide the more consistent and robust \nprices for achieving targets. \n \nKeywords \n \nClimate change; cost-benefit analysis; emissions trading; learning; model uncertainty; shadow \nprice \n \nJEL codes \n \nQ51; Q52; Q54; Q58 \n 3\n1. Introduction \n \nGovernments are increasingly making use of pricing as a means to protect the environment. This \nincludes the proliferation of environmental taxes and cap-and-trade schemes, but it more generally \nincludes the use of prices on environmental goods and services in appraisal of public policies and \nprojects. Cost-benefit analysis is now widely practised, including in the area of environmental \nprotection (Pearce, Atkinson et al. 2006). In other policy areas, environmental prices will also \nusually need to be applied. In a number of countries, including the United Kingdom and the \nUnited States, there is now a legislative requirement across the board to conduct a cost-benefit \nanalysis of significant new policies and policy reforms. \n \nThis places greater and greater importance on the methods of pricing environmental goods and \nservices. In an introductory textbook, this is apparently straightforward \u2013 some careful modelling \nof the costs and benefits of environmental protection at the margin will reveal the price of the good \nat the social optimum, a l\u00e1 Pigou (1920). But in the real world there are many complications, which \nmake the best course of action much less clear. \n \nChief among these is the significant uncertainty about the benefits and costs of environmental \nprotection. Moreover, the uncertainty is not just about parameter values \u2013 which would allow \nanalysts to work with standard risk tools \u2013 but about the structure of the underlying problem and \nhow it should be modelled. Indeed, the analyst will frequently be confronted with a number of \ncompeting models. In addition to uncertainty, environmental policy making in the real world \npresents numerous complexities, which apparently further increases the distance between the \nproblems that the policy maker must resolve and the solutions proposed in the basic textbook \nanalysis. \n \nIn this paper, we explore practical ways in which prices may be set in this context. Our motivating \nexample is climate change, where these complications are particularly acute. However we will \nhave cause to mention a number of other environmental problems, such as the pricing of \necosystem services, air pollution control and transportation. \n \nWe begin in section two with an outline of the problem of model uncertainty in environmental \neconomics. In section three, we draw some lessons on how to set the target level of environmental \n 4\nprotection given model uncertainty, and how to set shadow prices as instruments to achieve the \ntarget. We make the obvious point that, if there is uncertainty as to what is the \u2018best\u2019 model of the \nenvironmental problem, then policy makers should look to many models for evidence on the \nbenefits and costs of protection in setting targets. Moreover they should look beyond the full set of \nmodels, taking a reasoned view on elements of the problem that none of the models adequately \nrepresents. We go on to consider how to set the shadow price as an instrument to achieve the \ntarget. In this role, we propose two criteria that prices should fulfil \u2013 consistency and robustness. \nIn the case of climate change \u2013 and we suspect in other cases \u2013 these call for prices to be set against \nestimates of the marginal cost of environmental protection, rather than the marginal benefit. \n \nIn sections four and five, we introduce the prospect of learning more about the benefits and costs \nof protection over time. In principle, a number of insights emerge here. One is the effect of the \nprospect of learning, allied to the existence of irreversible environmental damage and\/or \nirreversible investments to protect the environment, on the initial target. Another is how \nuncertainty in integrated environment-economy models can indicate where the value of \ninformation is highest and thus where research efforts might usefully be directed. But we focus \nmost of our attention on how policy makers can learn from the revealed cost of existing policies to \nprotect the environment, in order to revise targets and prices. While holding much promise, we \nnavigate various complications attached to the \u2018second-best\u2019 nature of real policies, which make \nthe potential to learn less clear. \n \nSection six concludes. It notes that, in climate change, we have seen a progression in shadow \npricing approaches that in many respects mirrors our story. Price setting has evolved from an \napproach based on modelling the marginal benefits (or symmetrically the social costs) of \nenvironmental protection, to an approach based on modelling the marginal costs of protection, and \nnow increasingly into an approach that uses the revealed costs of policy, where they can be \ndemonstrated to be appropriate. The marginal benefit or social cost approach is associated with the \nSecond Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel  on Climate Change (IPCC: Pearce, \nCline et al. 1996) and the initial attempt by the UK Government to establish a shadow price of \ncarbon for the appraisal of public investments (Clarkson and Deyes 2002). In subsequent revisions \nof its guidance on the shadow price of carbon, the UK moved to marginal abatement costs (Price, \nThornton et al. 2007). Marginal abatement cost estimates have also recently been used to make \nrecommendations on a carbon tax in France (Rocard 2009). The move to policy-based shadow \n 5\npricing is exemplified by the UK\u2019s Committee on Climate Change (2008), which used estimates of \nthe market price in 2020 for allowances in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU \nETS) to determine the indicative abatement potential in the non-traded sectors of the economy. \n \n2. Model uncertainty in environmental economics \n \nIn principle, how to set environmental prices is one of the basic insights of environmental \neconomics, drawing on Pigou\u2019s (1920) classic analysis \u2013 calculate a marginal benefit function for \nprovision of an environmental good or service, a marginal cost function, and find the price (and by \nduality) quantity that maximises net benefits. Of course, in practice there are many complications, \nbut perhaps the most severe is uncertainty about both benefits and costs. \n \nThis uncertainty is pervasive, not being confined to more celebrated cases such as anthropogenic \nclimate change (Pindyck 2007). Moreover \u2013 and this is the crucial point for our paper \u2013 it is not of a \nkind reducible merely to uncertainty about a set of key parameters. Rather, there is usually a \ndeeper uncertainty about what is the best model to build to represent an environmental problem, \nwhich is to say that in addition to, or indeed underlying, parameter uncertainty there is model \nuncertainty.2 This is crucial, because model uncertainty greatly reduces our confidence in using \nstandard risk tools, such as solving the benefit-cost problem in expectations or calculating the \noption price of environmental protection, as we are unable to agree on the \u2018best\u2019 model of the \nsystem and its probabilities. This is often regarded in the sciences as a situation of \u2018deep \nuncertainty\u2019 (see e.g. Lempert, Groves et al. 2006), while economists have tended to distinguish it \nas a situation of uncertainty (Keynes 1921; Knight 1921) or ambiguity (Ellsberg 1961), as opposed \nto risk. \n \nModel uncertainty has become a relatively familiar problem in, for example, macroeconomics, \nwhere the failures of models to provide accurate forecasts of many recent trends are well known.3 \nIn any given macroeconomic model, there will be parameter uncertainty, for example about the \nvarious elasticities of supply and demand. But at least as important is model uncertainty, one \nmanifestation of which is the well-worn debate between advocates of various types of computable \n                                               \n2 Here as in many cases there are variations in terminology between economics and the sciences. Stainforth et \nal. (2007), for example, define what economists would understand to be parameter uncertainty as model \nuncertainty, and model uncertainty in turn as \u2018model inadequacy\u2019. \n3 Most recently the global economic downturn of 2008\/9. \n 6\ngeneral equilibrium (CGE) model, in which the dynamics of the economy are rooted in axioms of \nmicroeconomic behaviour, and advocates of models in the Keynesian tradition.4 One of the \nprincipal reasons for this debate is that the economic system is complex and in places poorly \nunderstood, such that there is a fundamental debate about the best structure of model to build to \nrepresent it. These difficulties are only intensified for environmental problems such as climate \nchange, where reductions in greenhouse gas emissions depend on the large-scale introduction of \nnew technologies into the economy (see Koehler, Grubb et al. 2006). \n \nModel uncertainty is also a familiar problem in the environmental sciences, despite the fact that \nenvironmental models often represent physical, chemical and biological processes, which are fairly \nprecisely understood under controlled (e.g. laboratory) conditions. The problem is that the \nenvironmental systems under investigation are usually open systems and are typically highly \nspace- and time-specific. In order to maintain analytical tractability, however, the modeller is \ninvariably forced to introduce artificial boundaries and to aggregate, both of which processes \nencode important and uncertain assumptions (Beven 2008). \n \nEnvironmental economics has of course to contend with model uncertainty in representing both \nthe economy and the environment. Moreover, perhaps the greatest source of model uncertainty is \nthe crucial linkage between the two, specifically how the environment provides economic value, \nwhere the modelling tradition is recent and small in comparison with modelling the economy or \nthe environment alone. For example, Watkiss and Downing (2008) made an inventory of possible \nimpacts of climate change on human wellbeing and analysed the coverage of these impacts by the \ncurrent crop of integrated assessment models (IAMs). They found that a significant subset of these \nimpacts, typically the most uncertain but at the same time most damaging, were not explicitly \nmodelled by any of the IAMs.5 Another such example is the conservation of ecosystems and \nbiodiversity, where their contribution to human wellbeing is one of the most poorly understood \nelements of the policy problem (Millenium Ecosystem Assessment 2005). \n \n3. Setting targets, and prices to deliver targets \n \n                                               \n4 Pagan (2003) provided an interesting review of these issues in a report on modelling and forecasting \npractices in the Bank of England. \n5 Weitzman (2009) considers this mismatch in thinking about the functional form of the damage or loss \nfunction connecting rises in global temperature with changes in human wellbeing. \n 7\nHow then should policy makers set environmental prices given model uncertainty? One very \nimportant consideration is the capacity to learn more about benefits and costs, so that uncertainty \nis reduced over time. But we discuss learning in the following section, choosing here to begin our \ndiscussion with a simpler, static question \u2013 what price should we set in the first place? \n \nTo begin with, it is useful to distinguish between targets for environmental protection, and \ninstruments to deliver them.6 In this paper we are primarily concerned with prices as an \ninstrument to deliver targets, whether that be through the use of explicit price instruments such as \ntaxes and subsidies, quantity instruments such as cap-and-trade schemes that set an implicit price, \nor through pricing the environment in policy and project appraisal. Conceptually, of course, \nsetting the target for protection is itself a form of price determination, so prices are relevant both to \ntarget and instrument choice, and our discussion of model uncertainty above has implications in \neach case. \n \nIn the context of target setting, one conclusion, which we presume is of near universal import and \nwhich follows from the preceding discussion, is that policy makers should look to many models \nfor evidence on the benefits and costs of environmental protection. Indeed, they should also look \nbeyond the full set of models, taking, with due care paid to familiar weaknesses in human \njudgement under uncertainty (Kahneman, Slovic et al. 1982), a reasoned view on elements of the \nproblem that none of the models represents adequately. The Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy \nCommittee provides a useful analogy here \u2013 its decisions on interest rates are supported by the \nBank\u2019s suite of models7, and the Committee exercises its own collective judgement on, and in \naddition to, this evidence. \n \nA related point is the familiar disclaimer of cost-benefit analysis, namely that CBA is merely one of \nmany inputs to policy making. The reasons for applying this disclaimer extend beyond model \nuncertainty. Usually what analysts have in mind is the set of normative and political \nconsiderations that is not generally incorporated in CBA (which is not to say that CBA is devoid of \nvalue judgements, a point to which we shall return below). The IPCC\u2019s regular series of \nAssessment Reports on climate change is one example of the qualified use of economic analysis. \n                                               \n6 See Hepburn (2006) for a stylised discussion of the regulatory process and the choice between price and \nquantity instruments. \n7 Although Pagan (2003) has criticised the suite of models for having been put together more out of \nconvenience than any explicit aim to compile a suitable set of models. \n 8\nThe Third Assessment Report (IPCC 2001) summarised the benefits of carbon abatement in five \n\u2018reasons for concern\u2019, which provide what is in our view a fairly good example of how various \ndecision-relevant measures of environmental damage, economic and non-economic, can be \ntransparently but succinctly combined. The reasons for concern were: (i) risks to unique and \nthreatened systems; (ii) risks from extreme climate events; (iii) distribution of impacts; (iv) \naggregate impacts (i.e. quantifiable economic benefits on aggregate8); and (v) risks from future \nlarge-scale discontinuities (essentially climate \u2018catastrophes\u2019). They have recently been updated in \nSmith et al. (2009). Ultimately though, in setting the overall target, there is no substitute for \ncomparing the economic benefits and costs of providing an environmental good or service.  \n \nIn the context of prices as instruments to deliver targets, we draw further conclusions. We suggest \nthat prices should fulfil two criteria \u2013 (a) consistency and (b) robustness. That is to say, they should \ngive us confidence that the targets set can be delivered. To satisfy criteria (a) and (b), we further \nargue that prices should initially be set against model-based estimates of marginal cost, rather than \nmarginal benefit. To explain why, our motivating example is climate change, but because many \nother environmental problems would seem to share the same comparative structure of uncertainty \nabout benefits and costs, we expect the analysis to apply more widely. \n \nFigure one is a stylistic representation of uncertainty about the benefits and costs of reducing \ngreenhouse gas (specifically CO2) emissions, with parameter and model uncertainty conflated. The \nfunctions of the marginal external cost of CO2, which has come to be known as the social cost of \ncarbon (SCC), and the marginal abatement cost of CO2 (MAC) are depicted as wide bands. Under \nsuch uncertainty, the possible set of socially optimal emissions targets runs from E\u2019 to E\u2019\u2019. At any \ngiven quantity of emissions in this interval, the MAC could be greater than the SCC, equal to it, or \nless than it. \n \nFIGURE ONE HERE \n \nFigure one shows that in the case of climate change, uncertainty about the marginal benefits of \nprotection (i.e. here, the SCC) is greater than uncertainty about the marginal costs (MAC). In Tol\u2019s \n                                               \n8 Although it is confined to impacts of climate change on production of marketable commodities (i.e. \u2018direct \nuse\u2019 values in the terminology of environmental valuation). \n 9\n(2007) meta-analysis, the full range of estimates from 47 published studies of the present9 SCC runs \nfrom \u2013US$1.8 per tonne of CO2 to ~ $654\/tCO2. It is not clear from the meta-analysis how these \nestimates depend on the quantity of emissions, but research has tended to show that it is not a \nmajor source of uncertainty (figure one depicts this, compared with greater sensitivity of the MAC \nto emissions), so we can take Tol\u2019s range to be indicative of the uncertainty at any given quantity \nof emissions (Pearce 2003; Hope 2005). The mean of the sample is ~ $35\/tCO2, illustrating that the \ndistribution of estimates has a large skew or, loosely speaking, a fat tail (see also Weitzman 2009). \nIn turn, since in climate change we are thought to face a large, systematic risk to the economy and \nhuman wellbeing, the range incorporates a significant cost of risk bearing, illustrating how value \njudgements about aversion to risk are present in economic analyses like this. \n \nWhile it is hard to find a meta-analysis of the MAC working in precisely the same num\u00e9raire, \nFisher et al. (2007), contributing to the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC, plot carbon prices in \n2030, which various models estimate are necessary to deliver particular emissions targets. \nUncertainty in the MAC has been shown to increase strongly as the emissions target tightens, so to \nplace an upper bound on the range we take an ambitious abatement path, stabilising the \natmospheric stock of greenhouse gases at around 500 parts per million CO2-equivalent (putting us \non the left-hand side of figure one). In other words, because the comparison of SCC and MAC \nuncertainty depends on the assumed quantity of emissions, we choose the quantity of emissions \nwith the highest range of the MAC, in order to make the most exacting comparison we can. \n \nIn this scenario, Fisher et al. (2007) estimate that the MAC ranges from ~ $0\/tCO2 in 2030 to ~ \n$150\/tCO2.10 Since most models of emissions abatement assume that the carbon price rises at the \nrate of interest according to the Hotelling principle, we can make a first pass at estimating what the \npresent MAC would be by simply discounting back to today using an interest rate consistent with \nsuch modelling studies. Taking this interest rate to be 4%, the range of the present MAC is ~ $0 to ~ \n$68\/tCO2, which is a factor of ten narrower than the uncertainty around the SCC.11  \n \n                                               \n9 These studies date from 1982 onwards, and different models have different base years, so in practice what \nis meant by the \u2018present SCC\u2019 can vary by two decades or so. \n10 Kuik, Brander et al. (2009) perform a similar meta-analysis, and estimate approximately the same range for \nthe MAC, albeit with a higher minimum and maximum. \n11 And it is itself likely to be an overestimate of the range of the present MAC, since the difference in the \ncarbon price between modelling studies tends to increase over time due to the rising importance of \ndifferences in assumptions about technological change. \n 10\nWhat this rough comparison of uncertainty reveals is an underlying situation in which models of \nthe SCC are more uncertain than models of the MAC. The fundamental reason for this is that the \nformer rely on an evidence base that is much more meagre than the latter (Dietz and Stern 2008). \nAs we mentioned above, there is a lack of evidence concerning the economic value of \nenvironmental changes as a result of changes in the climate (Watkiss and Downing 2008). In \naddition, due in large part to possible non-linearities in the system, we are highly uncertain about \nwhat climatic changes to expect (Stainforth, Allen et al. 2007). Indeed, such non-linearities are \npresent in many environmental systems and explain why few of them are well understood \n(Pindyck 2007). Even local environmental pollution offers up examples \u2013 freshwater lakes often \nexhibit the potential to abruptly switch to a euthrophic state at some unknown concentration of \nnutrient pollution (Scheffer, Carpenter et al. 2001). This can be contrasted with MAC models. Here, \nuncertainties are also present, but there is generally more evidence available to constrain the \nstructure and parameterisation of the model. For example, the cost of new emissions abatement \ntechnologies is one of the key uncertainties in most MAC models, but, even here, the technologies \nthat are assumed to be deployed in meeting emissions targets are already commercially available \nat known prices (i.e. MAC models generally work with proven technologies). \n \nIn cases such as this where the model uncertainty around marginal benefits is much greater than \naround costs, we suggest that a robust strategy is to make greater use of marginal costs in setting \nprices, rather than marginal benefits. However, care must be taken to avoid an obvious circularity. \nWhile marginal costs can often give us greater assurance that a given target can be met, clearly \nthey cannot be used alone to set that target, since we have no information about the benefits of \nemissions reductions. This is where marginal benefits still have a role to play, alongside a broader \nset of evidence. \n \nIn addition, use of marginal costs can provide greater consistency with overall targets. The reason \nis that models of abatement\/protection are more often than not explicitly run to deliver pre-\ndetermined quantities of environmental goods (i.e. cost-effectiveness analysis), so consistency is \nassured by definition. Parameters that are controversial in the context of cost-benefit analysis, \nnotably the discount rate, are set based on what private agents would actually be likely to face in \nthe market. By contrast, it is often difficult to identify whether estimates of the marginal benefit of \nprotection have been made in a model with assumptions consistent with the chosen target. Again \nusing climate change as an example, it may be that an emissions trajectory was chosen as the basis \n 11\nfor the modelling, which is different to that implied by the target. It may be also be that a discount \nrate was chosen, which could not support the target that was chosen (being e.g. too high). Thus the \nworld\u2019s largest emitters have made broad commitments to emissions reductions that would be \ndifficult to justify using the standard discount rate employed in Nordhaus\u2019 well-known IAM \nstudies (e.g. Nordhaus 2008). \n \n4. Learning about targets and prices \n \nHow does the prospect of learning more about the benefits and costs of environmental protection \naffect our discussion? First, economic theory shows that the optimal target under uncertainty can \nchange at the outset if one expects uncertainty to be reduced in the future, especially if the costs of \nprotection and\/or the costs of environmental damage are irreversible.12 Irreversibilities will be a \nfeature of many environmental problems. Frequently, environmental damage will itself be \neffectively irreversible, as with the loss of natural ecosystems to development and with the \naccumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere.13 Equally, there are quite likely to be sunk costs to \nprotecting the environment, such as investing in capital equipment to reduce pollutant emissions. \nWhat the theory tells us is that the adjustment to the optimal target to reflect learning is \nambiguous \u2013 it could increase environmental protection, or decrease it, depending on a \ncomplicated set of factors, including not only the existence of binding irreversibility constraints in \nthe environment and in investments to protect it, but also, in a by now familiar refrain, on the \nassumed model of the policy maker\u2019s preferences, such as over risk (e.g. the particular utility \nfunction that is assumed to be appropriate, and its parameterisation). Unfortunately for a problem \nwhose solution is ambiguous in theory, relatively little empirical work has been done that could \nsupport such adjustments (Pindyck 2007)14, certainly in comparison with the relative outpouring of \nestimates of the costs and benefits of protection in the absence of learning\/irreversibility. At \npresent, then, these considerations can only inform policy in a qualitative way. \n \n                                               \n12 Important contributions to this literature include Arrow and Fisher (1974), Henry (1974) and Gollier et al. \n(2000), while Ingham and Ulph (2005) provide a recent review applied to climate change. \n13 If a technology were deployed to remove CO2 from the atmosphere, accumulation of atmospheric CO2 \nwould no longer be irreversible, but there would still be a cost to removing it, which would bear upon the \ninitial decision of how much to emit. \n14 Examples include Kolstad (1996), Nordhaus and Popp (1997), and Ulph and Ulph (1997), all of whom \nconsider learning and irreversibility in the context of climate change. \n 12\nSecond, models of uncertain benefits and costs can be used to estimate the value of obtaining more \ninformation about elements of the policy problem, and thus to guide decisions on how to allocate \nresources for further research. This is one area where integrated environment-economy models \nsuch as the IAMs applied to climate change can be particularly useful, as they can produce insights \nthat would not otherwise have been obvious. For example, climate-change IAMs have tended to \nshow that uncertainty about optimal emissions reductions is as much due to the economic aspects \nof the model as it is to the physical aspects (Nordhaus and Popp 1997; Hope 2006), and that some \nof the principal economic \u2018uncertainties\u2019 have a normative flavour (e.g. the discount rate). As we \nhave warned, the predictive power of IAMs must be assumed to be low, so that considerable \ncaution should be exercised in drawing quantitative conclusions about the value of information, \nbut they have helped us to understand qualitatively where information may be of most value. \n \nThird, information about the benefits and costs of protection should allow us over time to revise \ntargets and prices, and improve models. In particular, we are likely to be able to learn relatively \nquickly about many of the uncertainties characterising the cost of environmental protection, by \nlooking at the revealed cost of policies that have been introduced (or in the case of a price \ninstrument, the revealed quantity of protection obtained at the price initially set). Here we can \ndraw a further analogy with the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee, which, for all its \nmodelling support, receives rapid information about the real economic response to changes in \npolicy such as interest rates, and can adjust them accordingly. However, once again, there are \nvarious complications associated with the reality of environmental policy design and \nimplementation that need to be considered, and we do so in the next section. \n \n5. Learning from the revealed cost of existing policies \n \nTo begin with, most environmental targets are accompanied by a range of policy instruments, \nsometimes overlapping, and the revealed compliance costs of these policies will vary widely. For \nexample, Pearce (2003) compared the revealed cost of a selection of the UK\u2019s most important \npolicies related to abating carbon emissions (our choice of words is deliberately careful here). \nThese included the Climate Change Levy, which is a tax on the consumption of fossil fuels and \nelectricity by industry, the Fuel Duty Escalator, which is a formula to regularly increase the tax rate \n 13\non petroleum road fuels15, and the Renewables Obligation, a requirement on electricity suppliers to \nsource a certain share of their total supply from renewable technologies. He found that the \nrevealed cost of carbon abatement varied markedly across (and even within) these policies. The \nrevealed cost of carbon in the Climate Change Levy varied from ~ \u00a34.36\/tCO2 for coal to ~ \n\u00a38.45\/tCO2 for electricity, because the tax rate did not correspond directly to the carbon content of \nthe energy. The revealed cost of the Fuel Duty Escalator, estimated as the real increase over the \nperiod 1993-1999, was ~ \u00a373.69\/tCO2 for gasoline and ~ \u00a380.11\/tCO2 for diesel. The revealed cost of \nthe Renewables Obligation was ~ \u00a384.47 tCO2. \n \nThere are good reasons and bad reasons for why policy costs may differ, so it is important to \nunderstand the basis of discrepancies. If the reasons are sound, all that needs to be done is to \naccount for differences in context when estimating revealed costs, even though this is less than \nstraightforward in practice (see below). If the reasons are bad, one would ideally go further and \nconsider changing policy. \n \nA common reason why environmental costs differ across context is that the policies in question \nexist to meet several objectives. Take for instance duty on road fuels. Consumption of road fuels \nleads not only to carbon emissions, but also to other forms of pollution such as local air pollution \nand noise. In addition, motoring leads to congestion costs and to road accidents (see e.g. \nMaddison, Pearce et al. 1996). In a country such as the UK fuel duty is also a major source of \ngovernment revenue.  \n \nTherefore an analysis such as Pearce\u2019s (2003) faces a form of inverse-optimum problem \u2013 \nestimating the portion of the revealed policy cost attributable to the carbon externality. In his case, \nthe assumption was that all of the policy cost was incurred to correct the climate-change \nexternality. The basis for such an assumption may be political statements, but it may be unwise to \ntake them at face value. Revealingly, Pearce (2003) noted that different justifications had been \noffered for the Fuel Duty Escalator at different times. Alternatively, one can attempt to estimate the \noptimal tax on a commodity such as road fuel from first principles (i.e. pricing each argument in \nthe optimal tax separately - e.g. Parry and Small 2005), but, as far as environmental externalities \n                                               \n15 The Fuel Duty Escalator was introduced by the British Government in 1993 with the expressed purpose of \nreducing carbon emissions, temporarily withdrawn due to protests in 2000, before being reinstated in 2008. \n 14\nare concerned, this typically relies on estimates of marginal benefits, something we have cautioned \nagainst on the grounds of uncertainty. \n \nWhether the attempt to meet several policy objectives with the same policy should be considered \n\u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019 is a classic application of the theory of second-best. In a first-best world, each policy \nobjective related to consumption of road fuel would be corrected using the most efficient \ninstrument. In general this requires at least as many instruments as there are objectives, as \nTinbergen famously established (1952). While air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions are \nindeed perhaps best covered through a tax on fuel consumption, the best policy lever for \ncongestion, which is highly place- and time-specific, would likely be direct congestion pricing. In \nthe case of accidents it would likely be a distance-based charge, since accident risk is proportional \nto distance travelled, ceteris paribus (Parry, Walls et al. 2007). If for some reason these policy \ninstruments are unavailable, then the second-best alternative may well be to price them into fuel \nduty. In addition, fuel tax could be an efficient means to raise government revenue compared with \nlabour taxation (Parry and Small 2005; West and Williams III 2007). \n \nAnother reason why revealed policy costs differ is concern about the distributional impact of a \nparticular policy. How distributional concerns should best be tackled across the basket of \ninstruments at the policy maker\u2019s disposal has been a matter of contention in economics for many \nyears. Tools with which distributional concerns can be taken into account when setting prices \n(such as equity weights) have been developed (Squire and van der Tak 1975; Fankhauser, Tol et al. \n1997), although they are not widely used. Typically distributional issues are dealt with \u2018outside the \nmodel\u2019. More problematic still are policy capture and vested interests, that is, deviations that \nreflect the influence of special interests on government policy. Most economists would see these as \nbad reasons for differing environmental prices. \n \nAnother common problem in learning from existing policies is that the policies in question may be \ninconsistent with the overall environmental target. The United States, for example, has a vibrant \nvoluntary carbon market, centred around the Chicago Climate Exchange. The prices quoted are \ngenerally low, in the order of $2 \u2013 5\/tCO2. They reflect the limited appetite of market participants \nfor onerous unilateral targets more than they reflect the costs of CO2 to society. As such, the CCX \nprice is clearly unsuitable as an economy-wide shadow price for carbon, although the scheme \nserves an important environmental purpose in giving participants an incentive to change \n 15\nbehaviour. The same probably holds for most payment-for-ecosystem-services schemes, which \ntend to be voluntary in nature (see e.g. Landell-Mills and Porras 2002; Wunder 2005).  \n \nThere can also be more subtle shortcomings in policy design. This is particularly the case for \ncomplex market instruments like cap-and-trade systems, which require sophisticated regulatory \nstructures. At face value, the price signals from the growing number of environmental markets are \nideal indicators of protection costs. The observed price in a well-designed environmental market \ncan be expected to reflect marginal compliance costs much more accurately than any modelling \nrun. However, for markets to reflect opportunity costs accurately they have to work efficiently, \nand this is a considerable hurdle to pass.  \n \nIt is well-documented that the structure and design of a market can have a strong impact on the \nresulting price (Fankhauser and Hepburn 2009). Limits in the ability to bank and borrow \nallowances between compliance periods, for example, can lead to artificial price fluctuations at the \nend of a period (Stavins 1998; Pizer 2005). Compliance penalties have a similar effect. They can \ninflate prices by making non-compliance more costly and incentivising firms to build in safety \nmargins. Alternatively, they may act as a price cap if the penalty is paid in lieu of submitting \nallowances. Price-stabilising interventions (such as an auction reserve price) have a self-evident \neffect, although it could be argued that they are there to fine-tune the environmental target in light \nof new information.  \n \nIn the early days of an environmental market, before it reaches maturity, prices can also be \nexpected to fluctuate heavily. Reliable information is limited and pricing models are still in their \ninfancy. Trading volumes are still low, insufficient to attract arbitrageurs. Hedging tools like \nindices and other derivatives are not yet developed. Even when environmental markets mature \nthey may, like all commodities markets, be subject to price fluctuations that owe as much to \nspeculation as to market fundamentals (see Paolella and Taschini, 2008, for CO2 and Pizer, 2005, \nfor price trends in the US air pollution market). \n \nBut over time, mature environmental markets will provide increasingly reliable indicators of \nenvironmental costs. One market that has probably reached this point is the US market for \nsulphur, a well-established and successful market that is driven by the regulatory requirements of \nthe 1990 Clean Air Act (see Bohi and Burtraw 1997; Stavins 1998; Ellerman, Joskow et al. 2000). \n 16\nArguably, the quoted market price for sulphur is by now a credible shadow price for this pollutant \nin the US context.  \n \nThe EU ETS could be another example of a market that provides an increasingly accurate \nenvironmental price signal, in this case the shadow price of carbon in Europe. Many of the early \nteething problems have been overcome (for an assessment of the early ETS experience, see \nConvery, Ellerman et al. 2008). The market is liquid, with several million tons of carbon traded \nevery day. The target is fully consistent with the EU\u2019s climate change objectives. A wide range of \ncarbon-related financial products is available, and a growing number of increasingly experienced \nanalysts are following market trends.  \n \nYet, one must doubt whether the current EU allowance price \u2013 an average of \u20ac18 since the \nbeginning of 2008, and less than \u20ac13 during the first half of 200916 \u2013 is high enough to reflect the \nmarginal costs of the EU\u2019s emissions reduction objectives for 2020 \u2013 a 20% cut in emissions relative \nto 1990 \u2013 or for that matter the social cost of carbon.  \n \nThe missing ingredient is trust in the market long-term. Traders appear to apply a hefty risk \npremium to the prospects of carbon trading in the long term. Futures market data for the first \nseven months of 2009 show an implied cost of carry between Dec09 and Dec12 EU allowances of \nabout 5%.17 That is, the EU allowance price rises at a steady 5% a year per Hotelling\u2019s rule. But the \ncost of carry jumps to almost 8% between Dec12 allowances and the less-traded Dec14, suggesting \nmuch less confidence in the market arrangements for phase III, which is to start in 2013. To take a \npunt on the 2020 carbon price \u2013 which is not traded yet but which analysts expect to be above \u20ac30 \u2013 \ninvestors would require a return of over 10% per annum.  \n \nAs long as these risk premia prevail, the EU allowance price is not an appropriate shadow price of \ncarbon for use in the non-traded sector. But one can speculate that the day when this will change \nmay not be too far away. \n \n6. Conclusions \n \n                                               \n16 Spot prices from www.bluenext.eu. Bluenext is the dominant exchange for spot trading. \n17 See www.ecx.eu. The European Climate Exchange (ECX) is the leading platform for futures trading. \n 17\nUncertainty is pervasive in environmental policy. There is not just uncertainty about parameter \nvalues, for which there are standard risk tools, but about the structure of the underlying problem \nand how it should be modelled. Climate change is a particular case in point \u2013 which has informed \nmuch of the analysis in this paper \u2013 but it is not the only one. Such deep uncertainty, or ambiguity, \npresents problems not just for analysis but also for policy. Whatever the state of knowledge, \npolicies must be set and this means, generally, putting a shadow price on the environment.  \n \nIn the case of climate change at least, the history of economic analysis appears to be following the \nprogression we have set out in this paper, whereby price setting is evolving from a social cost \napproach into a marginal abatement cost approach and eventually into a policy or market-based \napproach. \n \nThe social cost approach was afforded prominence by the Second Assessment Report of the IPCC \n(Pearce, Cline et al. 1996), and the UK Government\u2019s first attempt to establish a shadow price of \ncarbon for the appraisal of public investments was also based on the social cost of carbon \nemissions (Clarkson and Deyes 2002). In subsequent revisions of its guidance on the shadow price \nof carbon, the UK moved to marginal abatement costs (Price, Thornton et al. 2007). Marginal \nabatement cost estimates have also recently been used to make recommendations on a carbon tax \nin France (Rocard 2009). An example of the market-based approach is the inaugural report of the \nUK CCC (CCC 2008; Fankhauser, Kennedy et al. 2009a; Fankhauser, Kennedy et al. 2009b). One of \nthe issues the CCC looked at was the split of the mitigation effort between \u2018traded sectors\u2019 that are \ncovered by the EU ETS and non-traded sectors, like services, that are not. In estimating the \nemission reduction potentials in non-traded sectors, the CCC used the expected market price in the \nEU ETS as the indicative cut-off price for abatement action in other parts of the economy. \n \nAs we move through this sequence the robustness of the price signal gradually increases. The \nrange of uncertainty in the social cost literature stretches from  -$1.8\/tCO2 to over $654\/tCO2. \nMarginal abatement cost estimates vary between $0 and $68\/tCO2. Fluctuations in the market price \nof carbon (or more specifically, the price of Dec09 EU allowances) are narrower still, with a \nhistorical low of around $10 and a historical high of just under $40\/tCO2.  \n \nHowever, for each step in the progression, certain conditions have to be met before it makes sense \nto move to the next approach. In addition, the process is not linear \u2013 information obtained at a later \n 18\nstep can and should lead to revisions to earlier steps.  The social cost approach is an indispensible \npart of the process of target setting, and moving from social costs to marginal abatement costs \nrequires at least an indicative knowledge of the ultimate target, as marginal abatement costs have \nto be measured in the vicinity of this target. In the extreme case, the target has already been set \n(based on social costs and broader considerations) and the problem has become one of cost-\neffectiveness.  \n \nMoving from modelling estimates of marginal abatement costs to policy-based price setting \nrequires confidence in the policy environment from which values are transferred, both in terms of \nits consistency with the environmental objective and the effectiveness of the instrument. This is a \nconsiderable hurdle to meet. Often policies represent multiple objectives (e.g. London\u2019s congestion \ncharge, which increasingly combines traffic control with climate-change objectives), the influence \nof vested interests (e.g. the abolition of Britain\u2019s automatic Fuel Duty Escalator following \nwidespread protests) or flaws in policy design (e.g. the price collapse in phase I of the EU ETS). \n \nIn climate change, shadow price analysis has arguably progressed from social costs to marginal \nabatement costs. There is an emerging consensus (informed in part, presumably, by social costs) \naround stabilising the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases at around 450 parts per \nmillion, which allows the shadow price of carbon to be set according to the marginal cost of \nmeeting this target. Before long it should be possible to move to market-based pricing and deduce \nthe shadow price of carbon from the observed price in the increasingly liquid and well-functioning \ncarbon market. This will also help us to revise our models of marginal abatement costs, and lead \nus to reconsider the emissions target. \n 19\nReferences \n \nArrow, K. J. and A.
