The\nstructure, strength and power capabilities of a human are\nanalysed in engineering terms, and taken to represent the\nrequirements specification for a humanoid robot.\nTechnological alternatives to the biological components\nare reviewed and compared to this specification. The\nfeasibility of matching human performance is considered,\nand it is concluded that the necessary power and energy\nrequirements can be fitted within the mass and volume of\nthe human body.\nKEYWORDS: Humanoid\nperformance.\nrobot; Technology; Human\n1. INTRODUCTION\nThe aim of this paper is to investigate the feasibility of\nusing current technology to construct a robot of\nhumanoid form. It is not concerned with, say, the\nanalysis of bipedal walking, and the design of a walking\nmachine. It is concerned with the construction of a robot\nwith human physical capabilities, which can then learn\n(or at least be taught) to walk. This is an important\nphilosophical distinction. In order to have the capability\nto carry out a wide range of human activities the robot\nmust be of similar size, weight and power to a human.\nThe distribution of weight throughout the body must also\nbe similar if human movements are to be possible. One\naim of this paper is to assess the possibility of fitting the\nrequired technology into a frame of human size and\nweight. Clearly the problems of building such a robot are\nformidable, however it is the authors' contention that it\nis timely to consider the technological implications.\nA recurring dilemma facing this investigation concerns\nthe issue of knowing how closely to remain with the\nbiological analogue. In general the authors have adopted\nthe line that \"nature knowns best\", and consequently,\nunless there is good reason to depart from the human\nmodel, the human body has been adopted as the target.\nThis is particularly the case with requirements issues, but\na more relaxed approach has been adopted when\ndeciding on the most appropriate means of\nimplementation.\nBefore it is possible to write a specification for a\nhumanoid robot it is necessary to analyse the various\nfunctions of the human body in terms that are\nunderstandable to the physical scientist or engineer. In\nthis paper it is proposed that only the physical anatomic\naspects are considered. The difficult problems of sensing,\ncontrol, communication and intelligence will be the\nsubject of later papers. Each section starts with the\nanalysis (Man as Machine) and then goes on to consider\nappropriate mechanical analogues (Machine as Man). A\ndeliberate attempt has been made to avoid bio-medical\nLatin jargon.\n2. JUSTIFICATION\nCurrent industrial robots bear little resemblance to the\ntraditional humanoid forms widely depicted by science\nfiction writers. Does this mean that human shaped robots\nwill never be a practical commercial proposition?\nCertainly it appears that for the performance of\nspecialised tasks in structured environments the optimum\nconfiguration of a robot will probably not be anything\nlike the human form. Research into humanoid robots\ntherefore requires some justification.\nThe lack of adequate sensing systems and intelligence\nmeans that, for safety reasons, the current generation of\nrobots must be segregated from humans. This puts severe\nlimitations on the useful fields of application for robot\nlabour. As robots become better equipped to sense their\nenvironment, and as they become more intelligent, it will\nbe possible to make them safer and more flexible. The\nrigid segregation between humans and robots will then\nbe relaxed, and this will open up a vast range of new\napplications for robots as personal assistants in both the\nworkplace and the home. It is at this point that the\nhumanoid form becomes advantageous. The reasons for\nthis are:\n\u2022 Such robots will be able to function in the same\nenvironment as humans. They will be able to negotiate\ndoorways, stairs and obstructions in the same way that\nhumans can.\n\u2022 They will be able to use human machines and tools.\nThis is important because it allows humans to\nintervene and take over a task if it gets beyond the\nrobot's capability (and vice-versa!).\n\u2022 They will be able to use conventional forms of\ntransport.\n\u2022 Provided they posses the same physical strength and\ndexterity as humans, they can, in theory, carry out any\nhuman task.\n\u2022 Such robots would be more socially acceptable when\nsharing environments with humans.\n438 Humanoid robot\n\u2022 They would automatically be imbued with some of the\nbenefits of a hundred million years of evolution (the\nlongest running genetic algorithm).\n3. SIZE AND MASS\nClearly humans exist in a wide range of shapes and sizes,\nand in general, most of them can function adequately in\nthe world. This is comforting as it suggests that\nfunctional performance is not too sensitive to variations\nin physical stature. For the purposes of this study it will\nbe assumed that the target is an adult male of height\n1.8 m and mass 75 kg. For the performance of. many\nfunctions it is also important that the distribution of mass\nthroughout the body is maintained. Figure 1 shows the\nco-ordinates and masses for the parts of the target\nhuman based on data from US Air Force personnel.1\nThe figure shows a rear view. The figures on the left\nskeletal part of the figure show the mass of each\ncomponent and the z and x coordinates of the centres of\ngravity. The figures on the right show the co-ordinates of\nthe principal joints. The spine and neck joints have been\nadded by the authors.\n(14<l. 192)\n.

BONES\n4.1 Human bones\nBones provide structural strength to the human frame.\nThey provide support to the various organs of the body,\nand transfer internal and external loads down to the\nground. They provide the structure to enable the body to\napply forces to the external world, and thus accomplish\nuseful work. It is important that the structural strength of\na humanoid robot at least matches that of the human\nframe.\nThe principal bones in the limbs are roughly circular in\ncross-section, with the central portion filled with marrow\nwhich is a jelly-like substance with no structural strength.\nThe outer hard bone is a composite material consisting of\nstrong organic fibres in a brittle inorganic matrix. The\nfibres are in layers and adjacent layers often contain\nfibres running in different directions. This gives the bone\nshear and torsional strength. McNeill Alexander2 reports\ntypical mechanical properties for bone as:\nTensile strength, a = 100 N\/mm2\nModulus of elasticity, E = 10 000 N\/mm2\nDensity = 2 Mg\/m3\nHe also states that, for the human thigh bone, the\ndiameter of the hole down the centre of the hard shaft is\nabout half the outside diameter. Measurements of an\nactual human skeleton indicate that the outside diameter\nof the thigh bone is about 36 mm. From this:\nSecond moment of area, I = \/r\/4 (184 - 94)\n= 77 300 mm4\nElastic modulus, Z = 77 300\/18 = 4 300 mm3\nMax. allowable bending moment = o-Z = 100 x 4 300\n= 0.43 kNm\nA similar calculation for the upper arm bone, assuming\nan outside diameter of 24 mm, gives a maximum bending\nmoment of 0.13kNm\n4.2 Robot frame\nThe most appropriate artificial analogue for bone is\nreinforced polymer composite. A traditional form of this\nmaterial is well known \"fibreglass\", however in recent\nyears there have been significant developments in\nmanufacturing techniques and materials. Hollow tubes\ncan be manufactured very effectively by the pultrusion\nprocess, and filament winding techniques can add spiral\nfibres to provide torsional strength. For extra strength,\nstiffness and lightness, carbon fibres can be used to\nreplace glass.\nTypical mechanical properties for composites with\nglass fibres and a polyester polymer3 are:\nTensile strength, a = 250 N\/mm2\nElastic modulus, E = 130 000 N\/mm2\nDensity = 1.8 Mg\/m2\nIt can be seen that these compare favourably with the\nbone properties given above. If the outside diameter is\nincreased, the tube wall thicknesses can be made much\nHumanoid robot 439\nthinner, thus enabling the interior of the tube to be used\nfor housing motors or batteries. For tubes with a 1 mm\nwall thickness, the required external diameter to match\nthe bending strength of the thigh bone is about 50 mm\nand to match the strength of the upper arm bone is about\n30 mm. This leads to a total skeleton mass of only about\n2 kg.\nMuch superior properties can be obtained using\ncarbon fibres and epoxy polymer:3\nTensile strength = 1 400 N\/mm2\nElastic modulus, \u00a3 = 130 000 N\/mm2\nDensity = 1.6Mg\/m2\nUse of carbon fibres would mean that there could be\nboth increased strength and weight-saving.\n5. JOINTS\nThe bones of the body are connected together at joints\nwhich permit various degrees of movement . The simplest\ntypes of joint are:\n\u2022 Hinge joints, such as a finger joint, which can move in\nonly one plane, and hence permit one degree of\nfreedom.\n\u2022 Double-hinge joints, such as the wrist, which can\nrotate about two axes, and hence permit two degrees\nof freedom.\n\u2022 Ball and socket joints, such as the hip or shoulder,\nwhich can rotate about two axes as well as allow some\naxial rotation - hence three degrees of freedom.\nMany movements in the human body are much more\ncomplex than the above, and there is little point in trying\nto define the total number of degrees of freedom in the\nTable I. Degrees of freedom for a humanoid robot (excluding\nhands and feet)\nJoint\nHead\nNeck\nBack\nShoulder\nElbow\nWrist\nHip\nKnee\nAnkle\nDegree of freedom\nOx\ney\nez\n6x\nOx\ney\nez\nex\ney\nez\nex\nex\ney\nez\nex\ney .\nez\nex\nex\ney\nez\nRange\nin\n+60\n+70\n+80\n+20\n+30\n+55\n+45\n+180\n+45\n+30\n0\n+35\n+60\n+70\n+ 120\n+40\n+60\n+0\n+30\n+45\n+20\nof rotation\ndegrees\n-30\n-70\n-80\n-50\n-60\n-55 \u2022\n-45\n-80\n-135\n0\n-155\n-35\n-70\n-90\n-40\n-50\n-50\n-130\n-60\n-20\n-60\nhuman body, as this would simply lead to arguments\nabout what is a significant movement. For example how\nmany degrees of freedom should be assumed to occur\nbetween the 24 individual vertebrae in the spine? Also\nsome degrees of freedom are not truly independent, such\nas individual finger joints.\nFor the purposes of a humanoid robot a considerable\nsimplification can probably be made without significantly\naffecting its functionality. An example of this simplifica-\ntion concerns the shoulder joint. In humans, as the arm is\nraised, the initial range of movement is facilitated by the\nrotation of the ball and socket shoulder joint, but the\nlater stages involve movement of the shoulder blade. In a\nrobot, this movement could be accommodated by simply\nextending the range of movement of the shoulder joint\nand keeping the shoulder itself fixed in relation to the\nspine. This means that the robot would lose some\nexpressive ability, such as shrugging its shoulders.\nProbably an adequate range of movements can be\nprovided by a combination of single hinge joints and\npseudo ball and socket joints. This is shown in Figure 1.\nThe pseudo ball and socket joints would contain\nindividual actuators to control each degree of freedom.\nFor each degree of freedom it is possible to tabulate\nthe range of angular movement required. This is shown\nin Table I for the right-hand side of the humanoid shown\nin Figure 1. The joint positions shown in Figure 1 are\ntaken as the zero for all angles of rotation. These are\nbased on actual measurements of a human, but are, of\ncourse subject to considerable variation between\nindividuals. This results in 35 significant degrees, of\nfreedom excluding the hands and feet.\n6. MUSCLES\n6.1 Human muscles\nMuscles are the effectors that convert chemical energy\ninto mechanical work. They are a form of linear actuator,\nand are joined to a bone at each end with tendons. They\ncan only operate in tension,, and the tensile force is\ncreated by muscle contraction. This means that they\noperate in opposing pairs to give two-way motion, and\nthis makes the control problem easier. The torque\ngenerated at a joint is given by the muscle tension\nmultiplied by the lever arm. The value of this torque is\nhighly variable for the following reasons:\n\u2022 The relationship between the lever arm and the joint\nangle, 8, is non-linear. Thus the maximum force that\ncan be applied by a limb depends upon the joint angle.\n\u2022 The maximum muscle tension varies with the muscle\nlength.4\n\u2022 The maximum muscle tension varies with the velocity\nof contraction.4\nOwing to the above factors,meaningful figures for muscle\npower are difficult to come by. Many muscles have\nmerely a 'positioning' role-such as the head and neck\nmuscles, whereas the principal muscles of the limbs are\nalso important for performing actual work. It is therefore\nnecessary to be able to estimate the power of these\n440 Humanoid robot\nmuscles. Edgerton et al.4 reports peak values for the\nhuman knee of about 180 watts and for the human ankle\nof about 50 watts. The peak value occurs at about a third\nof the maximum velocity and half the maximum force.\nEnoka5 reports a power of about 200 watts for the elbow\nmuscles, which seems high compared to the above knee\nvalue. A more logical way of determining muscle power\nis therefore required.\nWilkie6 reported that human muscles can produce up\nto 500 watts per kilogram. This means that it would be\npossible to estimate the power of a particular muscle if\nthe mass were known. A problem with this approach is\nthat muscles often run diagonally across the body and are\nnot dedicated to a particular joint. For our purposes it is\ntherefore more meaningful to talk about a muscle group\nthat serves a particular degree of freedom.\nAnother approach is to calculate power from human\nperformance data. Enokas reports that an average\nhuman can raise the centre of gravity of their body\n324 mm (\/i,) above the ground from a static squat jump.\nThis involves initially bending the knees to lower the\nbody by about 200 mm (h2) and keeping the hands\npermanently above the head. If we assume that, using leg\nmuscles only, a human applies a constant force to\naccelerate their body over the distance of 200 mm, we\ncan conclude from simple Newtonian mechanics that:\nSpeed at lift-off, v = V(2g\/z.) = V(2 x 9.81 x 0.324)\n= 2.52m\/s\nAcceleration, a = v2\/2h2 = 2.522\/0.4 = 15.9 m\/s2\nForce required, F= (g + a)m = (9.81 + 15.9) x 75\n= 1928 N\nWork done, W = Fh2 = 1 928 x 0.2 = 386 J\nTime taken, t = V(2A2\/a) = V(0.4\/15.9) = 0.159 s\nPower required, P = Wit = 386\/0.159 = 2 428 W\nHubley and Wells7 report that the knee muscles\ncontribute about 50% of the work in vertical jumping,\nwhich would indicate the knee and hip muscles\ncontributing about 600 watts each. This seems a more\nsensible figure than Edgerton's above.\nAlso of interest are estimates for maximum angular\nvelocities of rotation and static starting torques. Similar\ncrude calculations can be carried out to obtain them by,\nfor example, considering the velocity of the hand to\nthrow a ball, or the torque required to perform a sit-up.\nTable II gives approximate values for the principal\nmuscles. The values given represent a best estimate using\nTable II. Power, speed and torque requirements for limb\nmuscles\nJoint\nShoulder, dx\nElbow, 6x\nWrist, dx\nHip, 9x\nKnee, ex\nAnkle, ex\nPeak power\nW\n110\n110\n30\n600\n600\n50\nMax velocity\nrev\/min\n350\n150\n150\n300\n150\n150\nStarting\ntorque\nNm\n70\n40\n20\n140\n160\n110\nboth published values and the results of simple\ncalculations based on human performance. Two impor-\ntant points are:\n\u2022 The figures given for power represent average values\nover the whole range of movement, and, as stated\nabove, human limb actuation is non-linear. Muscles\nmay therefore be capable of delivering higher peak\nvalues.\n\u2022 No account is taken in the table of static and dynamic\nstored energy which humans use to supplement muscle\nwork. For example static energy storage occurs when a\nhuman crouches in preparation for a squat jump.\nProvided the thigh muscles are not relaxed they are\npreloaded in such a way that the stored strain energy\nassists the jump. A good mechanical example is the\n'Anglepoise' desk lamp where potential energy is\nconverted into strain energy in a spring. In order to\nmove the lamp head, a force is required to accelerate\nthe mass of the head but gravity effects are cancelled\nout by the spring. Dynamic stored energy occurs\nduring activities such as running and jumping. Energy\nis temporarily stored in the elastic deformation of\ntendons and muscles. McNeill Alexander8 estimates\nthat this 'spring-in-the-step' can contribute about 50%\nof the energy required for dynamic activities with some\nanimals. Clearly a humanoid robot will probably need\nto exploit energy storage if it is to be competitive.\n6.2 Robot effectors\nThere are two candidates for mechanical analogues of\nmuscle. The first is the use of electric motors. Although it\nhas previously been stated that the powers given in Table\nII are average values, they are in fact only maintained for\nrelatively short periods, and electric motors can be\noverdriven at say twice their long term rating. However\nhumans use many subtle techniques to maximise muscle\nefficiency, and past experience has shown that machines\ninvariably need more power to achieve the same\nfunctionality. For example, when lifting with the arms,\nhumans will often use their more powerful leg muscles to\ndo extra work. Also humans use their flexibility and\ncompliance to get muscles moving and store elastic strain\nenergy in tendons. It seems prudent therefore to provide\nmotors which are rated to the values given in the table.\nThe question is - can conventional servo-motors provide\nthe performance requirements listed in Table II and at\nthe same time fit within the mass and volume constraints\nof the humanoid body? Consider the elbow motor, which\nrequires power, speed and torque of HOW, 150rev\/min\nand 120 Nm respectively. Trade literature9 for commer-\ncially available servo-motors indicates that a 150 W\ncontinuous output motor has a starting torque of 3 Nm\nwith a maximum speed of 6000rpm. As a maximum\nelbow speed of only 150 rev\/min is required, a fixed\ngearing of 40:1 can be used, which increases the starting\ntorque to 120 Nm. It thus exceeds the requirements.\n35 degrees of freedom require 35 individual motors.\nFigure 2 gives an indication of the weight of conventional\nservo motors of different powers. By assuming that those\nmotors that are used only for positioning purposes are of\nHumanoid robot 441\n500 600 700300 400\nOutput Powar (W)\nFig. 2. Mass\/power ratio of servo-motors.\nsay 20 watts average power, the total mass of motors\nrequired is 41 kg. Figure 3 demonstrates that, using\ncurrently available motors, they will fit inside the\nhumanoid body. However if the motors needed to be\nfitted with gearboxes, tachometers and encoders this\nwould increase their volume and weight.\nThere are relatively little known motors based on\nelectrostatic principles with a specific power per unit\nvolume ratio about ten times that of conventional\nelectromagnetic motors.10\" Their use would allow\nsubstantial reductions in weight, size and energy\nconsumption.\nThe second candidate for replacing human muscle is\nartificial muscle. Caldwell et al.,12 have developed a\nsimple pneumatic system that consists of rubber tubing\nsurrounded by a nylon braided shell. When the muscle is\ninflated it shortens and produces an axial force. Tests\nhave indicated the potential for very high power\/weight\nratios such as 1.5 kW\/kg at a system pressure of 2 bar.\nHowever such actuators can only operate in tension, and\nso two would be required for each degree of freedom.\nThis results in a total actuator weight of about 8 kg,\nalthough each muscle additionally requires a pneumatic\ncontrol valve. Unless much higher system pressures were\nused, problems would occur with the volume of\npneumatic muscle required to match human muscle.\nHydraulic actuators in the form of conventional cylinders\nmay also have a role to play.\n7. TOTAL POWER AND ENERGY\nREQUIREMENTS\n7.1 Human power\nThe total amount of power that the human body can\noutput is highly dependent upon the duration of the\nactivity. Skeletal muscle fibres are of two types.13 Fast\ntwitch (FT) muscle fibres have their own energy store\nwhich is available for immediate use, but has limited\ncapacity. A fuel called phosphocreatine provides a 5\nsecond burst of energy. When this is exhausted\ncarbohydrates in the form of glycogen are used. This is\nanaerobic exercise, and does not make efficient use of\nenergy. The Slow twitch (ST) muscle fibres depend upon\nthe circulation of blood to supply oxygen and fuel in the\nform of glycogen and glucose. This can take about a\nminute after exercise starts to establish itself. (This\nexplains why athletes warm up before an event). This is\naerobic exercise and can be sustained for long periods.\nFor very sustained exercise, such as marathron running,\nthe body uses fat as a last reserve of energy. Most\nmuscles contain a mixture of fast and slow fibres.\nWe have seen above that a jumper can output about\n2.5 kW and Enoka5 repots that a weightlifter can\nproduce a short burst of about 1.8 kW, however\nsustained power output rapidly falls off to about 375\nwatts after 10 minutes. Wilkie6 gives the total energy\navailable for anaerobic activity as 450 watt-minutes\n(27 kJ) and this is available for use at any time. This\nrepresents the area between the two curves shown, in\nFigure 4.\nThe output required for more sustained exercise can\nbe estimated by considering the power required for a\n75 kg human carrying a 25 kg pack to climb a 1 000 m\nhigh mountain in 110 minutes.\npower output = (100 x 9.81 x 1000)\/(110 x 60)\n= 150 watts\nThe above assumes that any energy used to raise and\nFig. 3. Principal humanoid motors. Fig. 4. Human power output over time.\n442 Humanoid robot\nlower the body during each step comes from stored strain\nenergy.\nFor very long term activity it is possible to estimate\npower output by considering the conversion of food\nenergy. Wilkie6 states that the efficiency of muscle for\nconverting chemical energy to mechanical work is a\nmaximum of 25%. Crist et al.14 indicate that the\nminimum required energy intake to sustain life is about\n7 500kJ\/day. Buskirk et al.15 gives a required intake for\nan average lifestyle of 12 350 kJ\/day and for very heavy\nwork of 16 700kJ\/day. Therefore if we take the\ndifference between the two extremes and assume the\nenergy is consumed over an eight hour working day, we\nget:\nAverage power input = 103 x (16 700 - 7 500)\/(8 x 60 x 60)\n= 320 watts\nBut because muscles are only 25% efficient this only\nrepresents a power output of 80 watts.\nTo summarise, the human has a power source that can\nprovide a steady output of say 375 watts for the first hour\nfollowed by 80 to 150 watts for a sustained period\ntogether with 27 kJ of energy which can be supplied as\nrequired in bursts of up to 2.5 kW. This sums to about\n2 500kJ or 0.75 kWh over a four hour working shift. In\nan emergency humans also have the useful ability to\nfunction at reduced performance for extended periods\nwithout refuelling. This graceful degradation can take\nplace over many days, and would be a desirable feature\nof a humanoid.\n7.2 Humanoid power\nIn the mechanical humanoid, for reasons given above, it\nwould be prudent to double the above figures. It is\nnecessary to decide whether the power would be\nsupplied by a primary energy converter, such as a petrol\nengine, or simply from energy storage, such as batteries.\nWork carried out on mobile robots for the SAFFAR\nProject16 compared the energy\/mass ratios of several\npower systems, and this is summarised in Figure 5. The\nwork was based on a larger power requirement\n(58 000 kJ), however the relative values are significant.\n7.2.1. Combustion engine plus batteries. If the former\nstrategy were adopted, batteries would also be necessary\nto provide the extra power for short bursts of energetic\nactivity. Small petrol engine of the order of 375 watts are\nPetrol engina\nLPG engine\nFuel n i l\nSodium sulphur battery\nLead\/Acid battery\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200\nEiwrgyAnau U\/kg\nFig. 5. Energy\/mass ratios for various power systems.\nwidely used for hand-held tools, such as chain saws, and\nweigh only a few kilograms. This would provide\nadequate power for the background load, and for\nrecharging the batteries. If we assume the engine\noperates at full power and at 20% efficiency, and that\npetrol yields energy at the rate of 43.7 kJ\/g, it is possible\nto evaluate the fuel load for a four hour shift:\nInput energy = (375\/0.2) X 4 X 60 X 60 X 10 ' 3 = 27 000 kJ\nFuel weight = 27 000\/43.7 = 620 g\nThe energy density for basic lead\/acid batteries is\n75 kJ\/kg, so less than 1 kg of batteries is required, but\nthey must be able to deliver the energy very quickly. It\ncan therefore be concluded that a complete power\nsystem consisting of fuel, fuel storage, auxiliary battery\nand engine should weigh less than 10 kg.\nSignificant disadvantages of an internal combustion\nengine include noise, vibration, air pollution and\nflammability of fuel. These disadvantages may be\nacceptable in some environments but probably not in the\ndomestic one.\n7.2.2. Batteries only. At the other extreme, if the option\nof all batteries was adopted the total mass of lead\/acid\nbatteries would be 2 500\/75 = 33.3 kg. The use of\nnickel-cadmium batteries would reduce this weight by\n30% to 23.3 kg, and nickel-metal-hydride batteries by\n50% to 17 kg.17 Sodium sulphur batteries reduce the\nweight to only 8.1 kg. However sodium sulphur batteries\nwill be discounted at this stage, as they are not yet fully\ndeveloped and need to be operated at 350\u00b0C.16 A\nsignificant advantage of batteries is that they can be\nspread throughout the body in order to achieve the\nrequired mass distribution. Disadvantages include weight\nand charging time.\n8. SKIN\nThe final element of the human body to be discussed is\nthe skin and other soft tissue that covers the body. This\nprotects the bones (and external objects) from impact\ndamage. The surface is self-healing and self-cleaning. It is\nthe repository for the touch Sensory system and it plays a\nvital role in cooling. Finally, it forms the final reservoir of\nenergy (fat).\nIt seems unlikely that, in the foreseeable future, robot\nskin will be as versatile, but it should be touch-sensitive,\ntough and protective. A closed-cell polyurethane foam\nwould provide an adequate base material, and would\nweigh less than 2 kg for the entire body. The nature of\nsuitable touch sensors is beyond the scope of this paper.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe principal properties and capabilites of the human\nbody have been quantified in engineering terms and as a\nresult of this the basic requirements for a humanoid\nrobot have been defined. Existing technology has been\nreviewed to see if it can match the requirements and in\ngeneral it seems to be capable of doing so. The\ncomponents are listed in Table III together with their\nmasses.\nHumanoid robot\nTable III.

Clearly the mass of gearboxes, joints,\nsensors, cables and the control electronics would add\nsignificantly to this mass, however current developments\nin the design of motors and batteries will ensure that the\nweight target is achievable.\nReferences\n1.
