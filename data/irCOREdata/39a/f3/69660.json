Entwistle1*, A. Bandrivskyy2*, B. Musizza3*, A. Stefanovska4*, P. McClintock2* and A. \nSmith1* \n1Department of Anaesthesia, Royal Lancaster Infirmary, UK. \n2Department of Physics, Lancaster University, UK.  \n3Jozef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia.  \n4Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia. \n \nPrevious analyses of cardiorespiratory coupling in anaesthesia have used linear methods.1  A \ndifferent approach based on wavelet transform2 and synchronization indices revealed a \nmarked increase in synchronization between the rhythmic oscillations of respiration and \nthe ECG3 in rats given ketamine and xylazine. The direction of interaction also changed with \nchanging depth of anaesthesia. Do these phenomena also occur in humans? \nWe studied 10 healthy men aged between 20 and 40 undergoing elective surgery. \nStandard clinical monitoring was supplemented by forehead BIS Quatro electrodes (Aspect \nMedical Systems, Leiden) for EEG capture and a TSD201 respiratory effort transducer \n(BIOPAC Systems Inc., Goleta, CA) for ventilator frequency (f ). A standard anaesthetic \n(midazolam 2 mg, fentanyl 1.5 \u03bcg kg-1, sleep-dose propofol and isoflurane 1% in 40% oxygen \nin air) was administered by the same anaesthetist. Recordings were made for 30 min in the \nanaesthetic room before surgery. Waveforms were digitalized at 1000 Hz and stored on a PC \nfor later analysis using the above non-linear techniques.  \nThere appears to be an increase in cardiorespiratory synchronization in these \nanaesthetized men. The direction of interaction was such that respiration was \u2018driving\u2019 the \nheart (Fig. 3).  \nWe now plan to monitor patients throughout surgery and into recovery to explore \nhow synchronization and directionality alter with changing depth of anaesthesia. \n \nAcknowledgements: J.
