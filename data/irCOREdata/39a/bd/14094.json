Paper- \nback, 136 pages, \u00a316.99. \nI must admit to a sense of anxiety when I see a \ntitle that contains the words 'formative \nevaluation'. ! think: 'not another book telling me \nhow teachers hould be aware of the glaring \ndifference between summative and formative \nassessment'. Of course, it could be worse - it \nmight just be a 'look I have just discovered \nevaluation and we REALLY should ask students \nwhat they think about our teaching book'. There \nare two possible types of book. The first, a \n'Janet and John' cookbook for educational \ndevelopers who have never ead anything before \n1990; 1 the second, a sort of New Education \nProject Manifesto. It was the subtitle - \n'mapping students' learning experience' - that \ncaught my attention. Students have experiences - \ngood, bad, planned, unintentional - lots of \nthem. We somehow seem to forget the individual \nnature of being a learner and of what it is like to \n'come to know' - also known as 'to learn'. In \nlearning technology, whatever IT (sic) is or \nshould be, the interaction between teaching and \nlearning is crucial. 2 Learning is a cusp between \nstable states; it sa bit like falling off a bike, only \nit does not leave cut knees. It leaves a trail of \nexperiences that merit further reflection. The \nprocess of coming to know is as important as the \nstate of knowing. Of course, if this book also \ntells me about 'mapping', I am hooked. As it \nturns out, George and Cowan do not tell. me \nabout 'mapping', but they successfully start to \nunpack the complex relationship between \nteaching, facilitating learning and curriculum \ndesign. How? \nThis book is about how teachers and learners \nshare experiences and how both come to know \nmore as a result of the interaction. The book is \nrooted in the innovative action research \nprogramme developed by Judith George and \nJohn Cowan. For readers who are familiar with \nProfessor Cowan's work, there will be few \nsurprises. For those who have not encountered \nthis reflective and challenging set of ideas that \ndeveloped from an association between George \nand Cowan while they were, respectively, Deputy \nDirector and Director of the Open University in \nScotland, there are some pleasant surprises in \nstore. But, beware, the ideas are understated and \nseem so simple that they are obvious. Obvious \nthings are easy until one tries them, for example, \n'Ask students what they think'. The difficult bit \nis to decide what to do with all the answers. \nGeorge and Cowan take the reader into \ndangerous territory. Reader - do not be under \nany illusion - this is deliberate. The authors want \nto destabilize your curriculum development. \nRemember, this is the John Cowan, the 'pioneer \nof (open) learning in the UK' (as the publisher \ntells the reader). Professor Cowan has developed \na wonderful repository of really useful ideas. He \nis someone who can make complex issues seem \nobvious. 3 But these ideas and stories are \ndesigned to induce change. He is ably assisted by \n103 \nReviews \nJudith George, and together they have produced \na really useful book. Why? \nThis book is a delight o read. Not only is it a \ndelight, it leaves one reflecting ON, reflecting IN \nand reflecting FOR teaching - as Cowan would \nsay. A quick summary of the contents will suffice \nbefore I draw out some issues that I was 'helped' \n(sic) to reflect on. \nThere are nine chapters, with a short biblio- \ngraphy and selective bibliography. Chapters 3 to \n6 are the core. They are about obtaining \ninformation about teaching and learning from \nformative assessment 'methods'. For example: \nMethod 3.5 (p. 44) is 'Talk-Aloud Protocols'. \nTriplets of students using a CBL package take \nturns to talk aloud about what they are doing, \nplanning, experiencing. Lists of points are \nrecorded and summarized to draw out signific- \nant points. Method 5.1 (p. 65): is 'Concept \nMapping'. Students off-load their thinking \nabout what they know in a visual format. \nStudents can share such maps with each other \nand the teacher in order to identify concepts \nthey are unfamiliar with or need clarification \non. 4 Method 6.4 (p. 84) is 'A Letter to Next \nYear's Students'. Students are asked to write a \nletter of advice to next year's tudents. The letter \nshould tell them about the good and less good \nparts of a course. As George and Cowan note \nabout this technique (p. 86): 'it provides indirect \nand relatively authentic nsight, mainly about he \nnature of learning difficulties with both course \nand tuition, as perceived by students.' In the \nmethods the authors provide, which are all in- \ntended to unpack the learning experience in \nterms that n alert teacher can understand, there \nis a range of techniques: ome technical and \nalmost psychometric (e.g. the Q-Methodology \non p. 94); some just useful with no theoretical \nunderpinning (e.g. Method 3.7, Self Review on \np. 53). My favourite technique is Method 6.9 \n(p. 90) Stop\/Start\/Continue. Students provide \nimmediate feedback on events\/tasks that they \nfeel the teacher should stop doing; continue \ndoing or start doing! Such a simple idea. It is \nboth useful and challenging. It must be a classic \nof formative feedback for teachers who are \naware or able to reflect. In this activity the locus \nis with the student; however it is the teacher and \nhis or her interaction with the learners that is \nopen to change. Imagine students being given \nthe accelerator and brake while we, as teachers, \nonly have the steering wheel! 5 \nChapters 1and 2 set the scene and get the reader \nasking 'What do I want to know about formative \nassessment?' The authors take an explicit action \nresearch approach to assessment. They state \nclearly that action research is 'conducting of \ninvestigations of a research nature which \nproduce useful findings relevant only to the \nparticular situation and people studied, from \nwhich the findings were obtained' (reviewer's \nemphasis). 6 Now, I take issue with the lack of \ngenerality in this action-researcher approach. \nGeorge and Cowan are researchers. They see \nteaching as a research-led activity. As teachers, \nthey are inquisitive and they want to generalize \nfrom events where it is appropriate o do so. I do \nnot feel they should be quite so cautious. Action \nresearch - an excellent metaphor for formative \nassessment - is a state of mind. Let's not worry \nabout applying what is discovered to different \nsituations - as long as the researcher is aware of \nthe general and iterative nature of curriculum \ndevelopment. One of my few criticisms of this \nbook is that the authors underplay the sig- \nnificance of general changes to teaching and \nlearning from the formative assessment of \nunique events. Have no doubt about it: these \nmethods are powerful and have general and \nlong-term implications for learners. \nChapters 8 and 9 are a bit of an afterthought but \nmerit close scrutiny, as assessment as a general \nconcept reappears and one asks why we need two \nterms to talk about mapping the student experi- \nence - 'evaluation' and 'assessment'. Like a \nsandwich, the best bit of the book is in the \nmiddle. Now, as a reviewer, I am not impartial. \nThe authors refer anonymously to work Cowan \nand I do at Heriot-Watt University. Neverthe- \nless, reading this book, in review mode, I was \nmade to scratch - and to think] \nHere are the issues that I was aware of as I read \nthe book. My comments follow each individual \nbullet point. \n\u2022 What is the difference b tween assessment as\njudgement and assessment as development? \nI really like this distinction. I am aware that as a \nteacher that I am paid to make judgements but \nwhen I think about it, I do not value develop- \nment in the same way I value judgement. \nScholars and journeymen make judgements - \napprentices develop. Yes? On reflection, \n'assessment as development' reminds me of a \ntension I feel in an oral where I want to help a \nstudent think about some issue in a way he\/she \nhad not thought about it before. I feel there is a \nole for the examiner to activate a learner and to \n104 \nAI:-J Volume 9 Number I \nhelp the student discover the new - while \nfulfilling the judgement role. \n\u2022 When is it OK to fail? Or, why is iteration a\ngood watchword for innovation? \nI do agree with the authors that the relationship \nbetween learning and teaching is an iterative \nprocess. Failure is OK. Mind you, when I tell \nstudents it is OK to fail, they look at me \nquizzically! Learners have to cycle through a \nseries of steps that Kolb would suggest result \nfrom a tension between perceiving experiences \nand engaging with experiences. John Cowan's \n'loopy' curriculum development model (shown \nin Figure 1.2 (p. 7) reminds me of Cowan's \n'loopy' experiential earning framework. 8 If \nteaching and learning are iterative processes - \ncybernetic (?) - then there needs to be some \ndynamic to move the process on. This dynamic \nappears to be formative valuation. \n\u2022 How can we get students to take ownership \nof their own development? \nNow this is something I worry about. When \nstudents have graduated and have secured their \nfirst job, will learning stop? What about the hype \nthat we all engage in about lifelong learning? I \nreally had not appreciated that the process of \nformative valuation is a first step to self-assess- \nment. If students are able to self-assess or \nappraise or personally develop - then they have \nthe ownership of the self-regulatory techniques \nfor lifelong learning. We, as teachers, disappear \nlike the Cheshire Cat - only the grin is left in the \nstudent's ability to get on with learning without \nus! It is only if we begin to model this iterative- \nreflexive process that lifelong learning will take \nplace. \n\u2022 How can we tap the latent or tacit \nknowledge that learners have in order to help \nthem know what they may not know they \nknow? \nI really do not know why I started thinking \nabout this. I suppose it is (again) the iterative \nnature of learning. Students ometimes appear \nto know things they did not know they knew. \nLatent or tacit knowledge may be experiences \nand concepts long forgotten. Causing learners to \nturn an inquisitive ye inwards eems to facilitate \nmeta-cognition. However, I sometimes think it is \nme, as teacher, who should be detecting \n(judging?) what students do not know. I know \nthat is what some summative assessments do. Yes \n\u2022 . . ?  Umm. . .  This book is getting me to think \nmore about the tasks\/activities that I can share \nwith my students, that cause me to develop my \nteaching and things the students can do to \nbecome aware of what they did not know they \nknew. As a facilitator of learning ('teacher'), \nshould I get students to tap into their experi- \nences and reflect FOR learning? \nSo where does that leave this book? The book \nirritates me - but then I am often irritated by a \nproblem, until I can solve it. It stimulates me - I \nsuppose I should say it actualizes me - but \nstimulated is more how I feel it. The book is \ninformative and suggests ideas that work - or \nseem to work. I am left with the desire to be a \nbetter custodian of educational development. I \nbegin to think of stories I could use if I were \nmaking a fast track application to the UK's \nInstitute for Learning and Teaching's (ILT) \nAccreditation Scheme! I find myself thinking \nabout teaching from the point of view of a \nlearner now that is a jolly good thing to do! If \nlearning technologists could only experience \nwhat it is like to be a learner then we could rid \nour institutions of a lot of poorly designed \nteaching materials. Few of us could learn from \nsome of the CBL courseware I have seen \ndemonstrated over the years\u2022 It does not matter \ni f  learning comes about as a result of an e- \nuniversity interaction with some distant guru or \na stop\/start\/continue task in a lecture. What \nmatters is that as teachers we facilitate learning. \nTo do so, we really need to make use of \nformative evaluation\u2022 Finally, I firmly believe \nthat as learning technologists we should be \nprepared to advise our colleagues and senior \nmanagers (sic) to make more use of the \nformative assessment methods described in this \nbook.

ISBN: 0-7494-3110-5. Paperback, x \n+180 pages, \u00a318.99. \nIncreasingly, networked computer systems are \nbeing used as vehicles for delivering teaching and \nlearning resources to groups of students who are \nlocated in many different geographical areas. \nThese students might have widely different \nbackgrounds, different interests and a significant \nrange of learning styles, abilities and preferences. \nIt is likely that the students and teachers \ninvolved in this type of educational delivery \nrarely, if ever, meet in a face-to-face context; \nthey meet each other only in cyberspace. \nNaturally, the teaching tasks and skills needed to \nsupport online learners of this sort are very \ndifferent from those needed in face-to-face \nsituations. This book identifies many of the \nskills that an online tutor\/teacher is likely to \nneed to draw upon. It also discusses how these \nskills can be developed using online networked \nenvironments to provide appropriate training, \nresources and support. Within this book, the \nauthor uses the term 'e-moderating' to refer, \ncollectively, to the various tasks and processes \nthat online teachers and tutors need to use \nduring the execution of their duties. \nThe material that makes up this book is \norganized into two separate sections. The first of \nthese (entitled 'Concepts and cases') is sub- \ndivided into six basic chapters. Collectively, these \ndescribe and discuss various issues and trends \nrelating to online teaching activity using \ncomputer-mediated conferencing (CMC). The \nsecond part of the book presents a compendium \nof 'Resources for practitioners'. Together, the \ntwenty-two items in this latter section of the \nbook present a wide range of ancillary support \nmaterial that would be a valuable asset for \nanyone who is going to become seriously in- \nvolved in e-moderating activities. The material \nthat is presented in this second part of the book \nis also carefully cross-linked with relevant \nsections in the first part - so that readers can \nfind out more about, and expand upon, the \nvarious topics, issues and ideas presented by the \nauthor. \nThe first of the six chapters in Part 1 of the book \nperforms a number of 'introductory' functions. \nFor example, it starts off by explaining the \nbackground to, and meaning of, the term 'e- \nmoderating'. This is done by means of a number \nof case studies taken both from the UK's Open \nUniversity (OU) and from institutions that lie \nfurther afield, such as Monash University in \nAustralia. The chapter then goes on to describe \nthe basic nature of CMC software (with \nexamples and illustrations of its educational \napplications) and the problems of attempting to \n'cost out' its use. In my view, the author offers a \nvery compelling example (taken from her own \nexperience of OU training) of the potential cost \nbenefits that can be obtained using this type of \nsoftware within instructional settings. \nIn Chapter 2 the author introduces a basic \nmodel for the use of CMC in education and \ntraining. This is called the kfive-step' model. The \ntheory upon which the model is based is \ngrounded in research that was undertaken at the \nOpen University Business School (OUBS). This \ninvolved analysing 3,000 CMC messages over a \ntwo-year period. These messages were sent by \nthe students and staff involved in an OUBS \nMBA course. The five stages involved in the \nmodel are: access and motivation; online \nsocialization; information exchange; knowledge \nconstruction; and development (based upon a \nconstructivist approach to learning). At each \nstage of the model both technical support and e-\nmoderating need to be provided in varying \ndegrees; in addition, the level of interactivity (in \nterms of message xchanges) also varies from \none stage to another. Techniques for using the \n106 \nAlt j Volume 9 Number I \nfive-stage model of CMC are further explored in \nthe second section of the book 'Resources for \npractitioners' (Section 7). \nThe third chapter of the book is called 'E- \nmoderating qualities and roles'. It considers the \nbasic knowledge and skills that are needed in \norder to become an e-moderator and uses \nvarious examples to explore and illustrate the \nroles that these online teachers play. The chapter \nstarts off with a discussion of the nature of the \ncore competencies that a successful e-moderator \nshould possess. Some of the key issues that need \nto be considered are then briefly outlined. \nAccording to the author, the major goal of an e- \nmoderator is 'meaning making' rather than \ncontent transmission. I deed, she postulates that \nthe main role of a CMC online tutor is to engage \nparticipants in an online conference so that the \nknowledge they construct is usable in new and \ndifferent situations. Some useful examples of \nachieving this aim are then presented in the \nclosing part of the chapter by means of three \ncase studies. Two of these are taken from \ncommercial settings (Quantas Airlines' Online \nCollege and Abacus Virtual College), while the \nthird originates from the OU's Centre for \nModern Languages. \nNaturally, if teaching staff are to take on new \nroles as online e-moderators there is a need for \nthem to be trained in the various techniques that \nare involved. This topic forms the substance of \nChapter 4. Essentially, this chapter describes the \nsteps involved in designing and developing a\nlarge-scale online training programme for e- \nmoderators within the Open University's \nBusiness School. Like many of the other \nexamples in the book, this case study is based on\nthe use of SoftArc's FirstClass system. The \ntraining programme itself is mapped onto a set \nof six FirstClass ub-conferences called: 1. Wel- \ncome; 2. Induction; 3. Teaching; 4. Planning; 5. \nHorizons; and 6. Lifebelt. The first five of these \nlevels of the online training programme are \nbased upon the five-stage model of CMC that \nwas described previously in Chapter 2. In \nessence, each of these sub-conferences r presents \na 'microworld' in which trainees can interact \nwith each other and with the convenors of the \ntraining conference as well as gaining \nexperience with the conferencing software itself. \nThe 'Lifebelt' sub-conference is used to provide a \nrange of online help facilities (FAQs, help desk \ntelephone numbers, and so on) for those who \nneed additional help and assistance during the \ntraining conference. Some further ideas and \nsuggestions for the training of e-moderators are \npresented in the 'Resources for practitioners' \npart of the book (Section 9). \nChapter 5 is given to descriptions of various \nstudies that are intended to  understand \nparticipants' experiences with CMC. It uses case \nstudies and examples to explore the needs of \nspecial groups of users - such as novices to \ncomputing and people with disabilities. A range \nof disabilities are covered including visual \nimpairment, restricted mobility, blindness and \ndeafness; although they are not mentioned in \nthis chapter, dyslexic users are considered in Part \n2 of the book (Section 4). Some of the other \ninteresting topics that are covered in this chapter \ninclude: learning styles (based on Honey and \nMumford's taxonomy) and how these can be \naccommodated in CMC; corporate training and \ndevelopment; gender considerations; and how to \ndeal with 'lurkers'. An extremely important \nprinciple that comes across from this chapter is \nthe need for participant induction. Indeed, the \nauthor recommends that 'induction for all is \nimportant, at least for the foreseeable future'. \nIn the final chapter of the book the author \nattempts to highlight and discuss a few key areas \nof future development that are likely to have an \nimpact on the work of e-moderators. Some of \nthe important topics that are discussed include: \nthe changing education environment; the nature \nof learners and their requirements; assessment \nprocesses in CMC; technological driving forces \nand the implications of these developments for \nCMC software developments. In her conclusion \nto this chapter, the author suggests that 'e- \nmoderating will become a key competitive \nadvantage'. She goes on to suggest that 'the most \nsuccessful teaching and learning organisations \nand associations will be those that understand, \nrecruit, train, support and give free creative rein \nto their e-moderators while addressing the \nnatural fears of loss of power and quality from \ntraditional university faculty members'. I guess \nonly time will tell if there is really any truth in \nthis prediction! \nAs was mentioned previously, the second part of \nthe book contains a collection of short \nprescriptive s ctions. Each one of these identifies \nand describes a topic or resource that most \npractitioners would find useful in one context or \nanother. Examples of these resources include: \nhow to choose a system for CMC; keeping e- \nmoderating costs down; online participant \ninduction; supporting and developing CMC \n107 \nReviews \nnovices; using the five-stage model; training e- \nmoderators; conferencing structures and \nhousekeeping; and so on. Essentially, the \nmaterial in this section provides a pool of \nresources that is often referenced by the various \nchapters in the first part of the book. Indeed, at \nthe end of each chapter in Part 1, there is a list of \ncross-references to sections in Part 2 where \nuseful extra supportive material can be found. \nThe author acknowledges the fact that some of \nthe Web references given in this second part of \nthe book may be out of date by the time it \nactually gets to readers (p. 165, Section 21). She \nhas therefore made available a Web site which \nshe suggests readers hould consult in order to \ncheck for changes (http:\/\/oubs.open. ac.ukle- \nmoderating). I tried this ite but, sadly, could not \nfind any trace of the URLs cited in the book \nmaybe none of them have changed? \nOverall, I found this book very stimulating and \none that I feel will be of value to anyone who \nwants to get involved in this forward-looking \nand exciting area of electronic teaching. \nNaturally, the nature of the skills involved in \nbeing an e-moderator a e likely to change as new \nCMC tools become available. Bearing this in \nmind, this book does give some valuable insights \ninto the types of development that are likely to \ntake place. Because online teaching through \ncomputer networks is now becoming such an \nimportant technique (for use both with distance \nlearners and with conventional campus-based \nstudents), the book should be applicable to a \nvery broad audience. \nPhilip Barker \nUniversity of Teesside, UK \nMichelle Selinger and John Pearson (eds.), \nTelematics in Education: Trends and Issues, \nAmsterdam: Pergamon, 1999.

These include the age of many \nof the chapters, the coherency of the chapters as \na book, and the tendency to see telematics as \nsynonymous with text-based computer-mediated \ncommunication. \nIn terms of the age of the chapters, the editors \nnote that the book was to be a follow-up to a \nprevious book (Veen, Collis, Vries, and Vogel- \nzang, 1994) that had been started up with one of \nthese authors (Veen) as the co-editor. However, \nwhen it became clear that Veen no longer had \ntime to devote to the book, the current editors, \n'left with a few chapters' (p. xi), decided to pick \nand finish the project. It seems from looking at \nthe chapters that in fact several of them may \nhave been from around 1995 and 1996, and \nothers from the intervening years. (This can be \nseen in the references in many of the chapters; \npredominatety prior to 1996 with maybe one or \ntwo new references.) While wise insights from \n1995 are not necessarily out of date in 1999 (the \npublication year of the book), the rapid change \nin experience base and in possibilities of \ntechnology as well as the extensive literature that \nhas accumulated in the last five years, makes it \nless than satisfying to read 'old' material. If the \nauthors had updated the old material to indicate \nwhat they and the field had learned in the \nintervening period, that would be another story. \nBut that is not done. And the unsuspecting \nreader who assumes that this is a new book and \ntherefore up to date, is not alerted to the \nvariations in time of a number of the chapters. \nPerhaps this timeliness aspect comes out most \nclearly in the definition f tetematics u ed by the \neditors in their preface. They say that ' elematics \nmeans all forms of computer-mediated com- \nmunications' in the way they use the term in the \nbook, yet such a definition is limited in terms of \nwhat is now relatively commonplace in terms of \nintegrated Web-based tools, resources and \nsystems. Telematics is the combination of in- \nformation technologies with communication \ntechnologies. Telematics in education today is \njust as much about information handling and \nmanagement, about support for collaborative \ntasks (which involves more than communication \nabout those tasks), about access to distributed \ndatabases, and about interactivity and multi- \nmedia as it is about text-based person-to-person \ncommunication. Yet, it is only the latter which is \nthe focus of many of the chapters of the book. \nThis would be all right in itself, but then the title \nof the book should be more focused, and the \nchapters should be chosen to be more in \nrelationship with each other. In summary, ! feel \nrather as if I have read a somewhat random \nassortment of papers from the years between \n1995 and 1998; this does not give me the feeling \nof a book. \nGiven these comments, what about he chapters? \nThe first chapter, 'Problematics in telematics' i  a \n108 \nAIt-j Volume 9 Number I \nparticularly weak choice to start the book in \nterms of its experience base small groups of \nstudents using early CMC facilities (bulletin- \nboard type services) in the period of (it seems \nfrom the text) 1991-5. The author makes reason- \nable and familiar points about success factors in \nCMC, but bases the chapter on the assumption \nthat 'there is a dearth of educational research to \nguide practice'. I would not have said in 1995 \nthat this was the case, and I certainly would not \nsay it now. How familiar this author is with \nliterature beyond 1992 cannot be told from \neither her text or the reference list. \nThe second chapter, 'Linking different ypes of \nknowledge in professional education and \ntraining: the potential of electronic ommunica- \ntion', is more conceptual than the first and'thus \nless affected by the timeliness problem, and has a \nwider range of references in both time and \nscope. However, what I feel is constraining about \nthe chapter is the apparent assumption that it is \nonly or primarily by CMC that the linkage \nnamed in the title of the chapter occurs. The \nmuch more complex interactions among profes- \nsionals that involve sharing and reuse of \nresources and collaboration on authentic tasks \nthat are now the most powerful aspect of linking \nprofessional education with training are not \nrepresented in the chapter. Again, the feeling is \nthat 'telematics' (according to these authors) \nmeans people writing text messages to each \nother. And again, this is a limited view of what is \nnow common practice. \nIn contrast, although the references in Chapter \n3, 'Pedagogic roles and dynamics in telematics \nenvironments', are generally before 1998, the \nmaterial itself is conceptually timely (and is not \nbased only on CMC). The chapter is structured \naround questions uch as 'Do computers change \nclassroom dynamics?' and 'What would it take to \ncreate classrooms where active learning is \nvalued?' But the relationship of this chapter, \nfocused on teachers in the school setting, to the \nother chapters in the book is only at a very \ngeneral level. The feeling of lack of cohesion of \nthe book begins here. \nChapter 4 would have been better placed \nfollowing Chapter 2, because it also is a con- \nceptual article, probably written in about 1995, \nthat goes no further than 'online discussions' in\nterms of telematics. The chapter is abstract (with \nperspectives such as 'Technology is, in other \nwords, inherently ideological, and all techno- \nlogical decisions in educational settings are, thus, \ninherently political' (Selfe, 1992; quoted on \np. 51). While the tone and style of the chapter \nare most like Chapter 2, the fit of the chapter \nwith the rest of the book is another example of \nthe lack of coherency between the chapters, it \njust seems to be there. \nChapter 5 ('Pedagogical foundations of open \nlearning environments') is more like Chapter 3 \na good conceptual overview that brings more to \nfocus than only text-based messaging. However, \nthe chapter deals more with the concept of open \nlearning than it does with the topic of 'telematics \nin education' (the two are not necessarily \noverlapping). The reader choosing this book for \nan up-to-date overview of telematics in educa- \ntion will not really find it in this chapter either. \nChapter 6 ('Techniques for analysing online \ninteraction') is another of the apparently 'old' \nCMC articles, conceptually focused on topics \nsuch as Speech Act Theory and 'other \napplications of linguistic theory to CMC \nanalysis'. The chapter is narrow in its focus, \nhighly academic in its tone, and it does not seem \nto me to represent either trends or issues (or the \ngeneral topic of telematics in education). \nChapters 7 and 8 are more satisfying in terms of \napplicability and being up-to-date. Chapter 7 \n('Firmer links between telematics, multicultur- \nism and foreign language learning method- \nology') would be more satisfying, however, if \nthere were another chapter in the book about a \nspecific learning domain. Otherwise, why only \none chapter about an application area? Why \nforeign language learning instead of mathem- \natics, or history, or physics, for example? Again \nthe feeling is of a collection of chapters with no \nreal cohesiveness. Chapter 8 is specifically about \nthe Web ('Different roles the Web can play'). It is \na nice overview based on some early experiences \nwith Web use in the author's university-level \ncourses. However, it too gives the feeling of \nbeing written in about 1997; not a problem in \nitself if the author or editors would make an \nexplicit comment on what they have learned \nsince then, also from the experiences of others. \nThe next chapter is perhaps the most jarringly \nout of place in the book - in terms of its fit with \nthe rest of the chapters. Its title is 'Implementing \nthe Internet in schools: a case study of Northern \nIreland'. Suddenly, we are at a very different \nlevel and type of perspective than what has come \nbefore in the book. While it is interesting to read \nabout the Northern Ireland experience, I wonder \nif the readers who will respond to the theoretical \n109 \nRenews \nCMC materials in Chapters 2, 4 and 6, for \nexample, will feel that this chapter belongs in the \nsame book? In this chapter, it is interesting that \nCMC is not the dominant focus as it is in the \nchapters that were probably written in an earlier \nperiod. This is logical, in that CMC is no longer \nthe dominant focus of telematics use in \neducation. \nChapter 10 is also strange in this collection. It is \ntitled 'Urban cyberspace initiatives: applying \nsocial constructivism theory to design, peda- \ngogy, technology and sustainability in urban \ncenters'. It is rather hard to summarize this \nchapter. Is it describing a project? A conceptual \nframework? A theoretical vision? All of these? \nThe authors are apparently describing the \nconceptual framework that they have used in a \nnumber of projects relating to technology-based \nprogrammes in urban settings. Subheadings \ninclude 'Epistemologic inclusionism as a service \nmodality' and 'Diversity, demographics and \nuniversity service in the inner city'. While the \nlatter, particularly, is a worthy topic, the \nrelationship to telematics in education is not so \neasy to find. The sub-projects described involve \nmany technologies, only some of which are \ntelematics. Some of the sub-projects were in \nearly periods, such as 19924. The trends and \nemerging issues sections at the end of the \nchapter are timely and valuable; it is just that the \nrelationship of this chapter to the book, its title, \nand the other chapters is not so clear. \nI am glad of the last two chapters, 'Desktop \nvideo-conferencing: telematic learning' and 'The \nfuture of learning in virtual reality environ- \nments', in that they at least bring in more of the \npossibilities of 1999 telematics in education. The \ndesktop video conferencing chapter also appears \nto be several years old, however, and says \nnothing about linking video conferencing with \nother functionality in a Web environment, or the \neducational possibilities of the reuse of video \nconferencing materials as video on demand. The \nlast chapter, about virtual reality, is the sort of \nchapter I expected to find throughout the book: \nup to date, with new insights, and fitting the title \nTelematics in Education: Trends and Issues. \nThus, in summary, perhaps my view is biased \nbecause I expect a book with a certain title to \npresent up-to-date and cohesively organized \nmaterial relating to that title. While most of the \nindividual chapters, as chapters read in isolation, \nhave interesting points, the lack of direct \nacknowledgement of the time and experience \nupon which each is based forces the reader to \nwonder with each chapter why the chapter is \nhere and if there could have been others, more \nup to date, which would better represent the \npromise made by the title of the book. The \neditors' interest is clearly in text-based \ncomputer-mediated communication. It would \nhave been better to keep the chapters and title \nfocused on that theme rather than the mixture of \ntopics and old and new technologies that are \nnow represented. \nBetty Collis \nUniversity of  Twente, The Netherlands \nSally Brown, Phil Race and Joanna Bull, \nComputer-assisted Assessment in Higher \nEducation, London: Kogan Page, 1999. ISBN: 0- \n7494-3035-4. Paperback, xii+205 pages, \u00a319.99. \nThe potential of Computer-Assisted Assessment \n(CAA) is increasingly attracting the attention of \nstaff in higher education and this latest addition \nto SEDA's Staff and Educational Development \nSeries provides a useful overview to most, but \nperhaps not all, of the major issues surrounding \nCAA. The focus of the book is very much on the \ntheme of how the computer-assisted delivery of \nmultiple-choice questions (MCQs) can be \nexploited in the learning process. To be fair to \nthe authors, it is probably true to say that most \ncontemporary CAA is concerned with the \ndelivery of MCQs. However, it is a little dis- \nappointing that in a collection such as this the \nissue of using simulations in CAA is really only \ntouched upon in one essay and that there is little \nor no consideration of the role of multimedia or \nof the role that computers might play in \nproviding integrated feedback for essay-style \nassessments. Nonetheless, readers will find much \nthat is of interest and value. \nThe book is a collection of nineteen papers on \nvarious aspects of CAA and these are grouped \ntogether into three sections: 'Pragrnatics and \npracticalities of CAA', 'Using CAA for format- \nive assessment', and 'Learning from experience'. \nIn the words of the editors 'this book . . ,  starts \nwith lecturers' words about why it can't be done \nand ends with students' words about what \nhappened when it was done' (p. 5). In between it \nreports on practical experiments in CAA, on \nexamples of good practice, on problematic ssues \nsurrounding CAA and on the experiences of \nthose who have encountered CAA whether as \nstudents or as tutors. The book also has a very \nuseful introduction and potential readers would \nII0 \nAIt J Volume 9 Number I \nbe well advised to read it with some care. In less \nthan four pages it briefly summarizes and \nintroduces all the contributions to the book and \nso provides a valuable guide to what is available \nwithin its pages. \nThe first, and largest, section of the book \npresents a range of practical considerations that \narise as one approaches CAA. Indeed, the first \nchapter by Jen Harvey and Nora Mogey is \nessentially a set of frequently asked and often \nnegative questions. Their responses to these \nFAQs are rather more encouraging and point the \nway to many of the fuller discussions later in this \nsection and elsewhere in the book. These include \nissues such as effective question design (Norma \nPritchett), and questions of security (Dave \nWhittington) and fairness (Mark Brosnan inter \nalia). Also, of particular interest is the automatic \ngeneration of tests (M. Thelwall) from, for \nexample, a database, ven a national database, of \nquestions (J. H. Sims Williams et al.). \nSecurity emerges as a major issue throughout the \nfirst section and not simply as a question of how \nto insure data integrity or protect against \ndishonesty. It also touches upon the question of \nwhat it means to undertake CAA in exam \nconditions. This is a question of both security \nand fairness; the more especially if the CAA is \nundertaken at a distance. \nInterestingly, the s cond section's emphasis on \nformative assessment might almost be seen as a \nresponse to some of the security questions. \nCertainly many users of CAA steer clear of \nusing it for summative assessment precisely \nbecause of security problems. However, the \nauthors in this section are more concerned with \nthe use of CAA to enhance the formative \nexperience. Implicit, and sometimes explicit, in \nthis discussion is the view that too often \nassessment is seen by staff and students alike in a \npurely summative way. It is seen as demon- \nstrating what has been learned rather than as \ncontributing to the learning process. The \nargument here is that CAA can be exploited to \nprovide a highly personalized opportunity to \npractice and, as such, more usefully integrates \nassessment into the whole learning process. \nAs its title, 'Learning from experience', suggests \nthe third section is largely devoted to reporting \non specific implementations of QAA and how \nthey were received by both staff and students. \nThe contribution by Roy Seden considers the \nrole of computer simulations in CAA and \nanother, by Myles Danson, reminds us that \nCAA does not actually have to be delivered by \ncomputers. Optical Mark Reading (OMR) has \nbeen around for many years and a number of \ninstitutions have achieved very considerable \nefficiency gains by exploiting this technology. \nFinally, Joanna Bull's brief conclusion looks \nforward and identifies 'four main issues that \nneed to be considered and integrated, with each \nother and with existing structures and systems, \nin order to effectively utilise CAA' (p. 193). They \nare: the evolution of an appropriate pedagogy \nfor CAA; suitable management of the whole \nprocess of assessment of which CAA is a part; \nappropriate quality assurance and staff develop- \nment; and organizational nd strategic integra- \ntion. In short, she recognizes that developing the \nfull potential of CAA is likely to contribute \nsignificantly to a sea change in the way in which \nhigher education is conducted. \nBruce lngraham \nUniversity of Teesside \nRay McAleese (ed.), Hypertext: Theory into \nPractice, 2nd edn, Exeter, UK: Intellect Books, \n1999. ISBN: 1-871516-28-5. Paperback, xvi+144 \npages, \u00a314.95. \nMcAleese points out that during the Second \nWorld War a poster read 'Is your journey really \nnecessary?' Many of us in the UK have had to \nconsider just this question recently. As I write, \nthe pickets have stopped blockading the oil \nrefineries and we are looking forward to the \nreturn of normality to our lives. There is still the \nthreat of further action which could bring the \ncountry to a halt. \nBut at the dawn of a new millennium, do we \nthink about the 'journeys' we take on the Web? \nAnd do we know how to design our systems to \nhelp users make effective and efficient journeys? \nThis book starts to ask questions of this sort. \nThis is the second edition of a book which \nintroduced us to the notion of 'lost in hyper- \nspace' and probably provided many people with \nan introduction to hypertext. It was first pub- \nlished in 1988 as an outcome of the first UK \nHypertext Conference. As such, you may think \nthat it is only of interest as a historical docu- \nment. But what immediately struck me is that \nmany of the questions being asked in the papers \nare still valid today. \nRay McAleese has written an extended preface \nand his style and prose drew me into the story of \nthe book and the history of hypertext. He \nIll \nReviews \ndescribes hypertext as the 'grin of the Cheshire \nCat. The cat is long dead and transmogrified. \nHowever, its simple and tantalising grin \npermeates almost every aspect of computing \nfrom home shopping to computer-supported \ndistance learning, or support groups for the \nbereaved to interactive multi-player games'. He \nrevisits all the chapters and provides informative \nand honest reflections on their current status. \nThe first chapter is McAleese's original overview \nof the book in which he describes some common \nthemes and some questions for the reader. In the \nsecond chapter, he discusses the difference \nbetween avigation and browsing and describes \na study of the strategies users use when working \nwith different ypes of interface. In Chapter 3, \nTrigg and Suchman describe their experiences of\nusing NoteCards for collaborative writing. \nAllinson and Hammond, in Chapter 4, describe \nthe design, implementation a d evaluation of a \nlearning support environment and their use of a \ntravel holiday metaphor to help the user. \nChapter 5 by Baird and Percival describes the \ndifficulties in designing Glasgow Online, a \ncommunity information system aimed at a wide \nrange of users. Cooke and Williams, in Chapter \n6, describe the difficulties associated with \ndesigning large, screen-based ocumentation \nsystems and how these can be integrated with \npaper-based systems. Chapter 7 by Edwards and \nHardman describes a study into how readers of \nhypertext represent its structure. They discuss \nthe implications of this for the design of \nhypertext and appropriate navigation tools. In \nChapter 8, Harland describes his use of \nGuideTM to prototype a display design. \nChapter 9 by McKnight, Richardson and Dillon \npresents hypertext from the perspective of the \nauthors of a hypertex,t document and highlights \nthe problems that they encounter in trying to \ndefine and label the links. Storrs, in Chapter 10, \ndescribes KANT, a knowledge analysis tool \ndesigned for civil servants to help them translate \npaper-based documents into hypertext. In \nChapter 11, Duncan discusses how research on \nfacet analysis can be used to design NoteCards \nsystems which are effective for users. Kibby and \nMayes conclude the book in Chapter 12 with a \ndescription of the routing system which was the \nbasis of the design of StrathTutor in which the \nknowledge domain is separate from the \ninstructional frames. \nOne issue which is visited repeatedly in the book \nis the use of metaphors for the ways in which \npeople move through hypertext systems. We are \nof course now all very familiar with the term \nsurfing, but in the early 1980s, terms such as \nnavigating, wandering, browsing and the \nmetaphor of a journey were key. In Chapter 7, \nEdwards and Hardman discuss how users create \ncognitive representations of hypertext structures \nin the form of survey-type maps. How has the \nuser changed over the past twelve years? Have \nwe developed a better ability to make these sorts \nof maps? Or have we developed ifferent skills? \nSo what are the questions that we are still asking \ntoday? I was struck by Trigg and Suchman in \nChapter 3 who discuss how they adopt practice \nin the use of NoteCards for collaboration. They \npoint out that their collaboration i volves two \nkinds of conventions: those that already exist in \ntheir community, and those that they create \nwithin the particular environment. They \nconclude their chapter with: 'Perhaps the main \nlesson to be learned from our experience is the \nimportance of supporting users' adaptation of \nthe technology.' I think this is still the case. \nKim Issroff \nUniversity College London \nJohn P. Wilson (ed.), Human Resource Develop- \nment: Learning and Training for Individuals and \nOrganisations, London: Kogan Page, 1999. \nISBN: 0-7494-3050-8. Paperback, xxviii+531 \npages, \u00a324.95. \nThis book contains an edited collection of \ntwenty-four perspectives on learning, training \nand development (LTD) co-ordinated by John \nWilson of Sheffield University. The book is \narranged in six sections: the first explores the \nmeaning of the terms and considers the strategic \nrole of human resource development (HRD) in \norganizational development and how education \nand training can be used at a national evel to \nencourage economic development. The n xt four \nsections are built around the traditional training \ncycle: identification of LTD needs; planning and \ndesign of LTD; delivering LTD; assessment and \nevaluation of LTD. The book concludes with a \nsection exploring the broader issues of managing \nthe HRD function. \nThis definitive handbook on HRD sets out 'to \nintegrate both theory and practice within a \nvirtuous circle'. The application of theory to \npractice is emphasized by the extensive use of \ncase studies, a total of forty-five throughout the \nbook. The case studies give an international \nflavour to the book. The strong academic input is \nbalanced by many practitioners' perspectives on \n112 \nAir-] Volume 9 Number I \nadult education and training. These are provided \nby Richard Firth, Cheryl Hunt, Dominic Irvine, \nRichard Palmer, David Sawdon, John Shipton \nand Chris Wiltsher. Practitioner perspectives \nderive from a number of industrial sectors, \nincluding health care, management development, \nfood, aerospace and engineering as well as from \nfreelance consultants. The large number of \ncontributions from staff at the University of \nSheffield (Ian Andrews, Ron Chapman, Geoff \nChivers, A. Ibarz, Jennifer Joy Matthews, Maggie \nMcPherson, Janet Parr and John E Wilson) \nreflects the book's growth out of the M.Ed. in \nTraining and Development at the University of \nSheffield. Additional 'contributions come from \nthe Universities of: Sheffield Hallam (Colin \nBeard and Joan E. Keogh); De Montfort (Sue \nBalderson); Bradford (Alan Cattell and Pete \nSayers); Warwick (Cathie Edwards); Bath (Rita \nJohnston); UMIST (Bland Tomkinson); and \nNijmegen, The Netherlands (Rob Poell). \nSection 1 includes six contributions and offers \nan introduction to LTD and its role in organiza- \ntion development. The first chapter, HRD (John \nP. Wilson), explores terms including training, \neducation and development. The second, \n'Strategy and training and development' (Sue \nBalderson), considers the strategic role of HRD. \nThe third chapter discusses human resource \nmanagement (John Shipton). Chapters 4 and 5, \n'Organisational change' (Bland Tomkinson) and \n'The learning organisation: a critical evaluation' \n(Rob Poell) investigate the role of HRD in \norganizational development. The final chapter, \n'National economic development and human \nresource development' (John P. Wilson), dis- \ncusses the integration of education and training \nand how they are used at a national level to \nencourage economic development. \nSection 2 consists of three chapters. Chapter 7 \n(by Richard Palmer) explores the provision of \ninformation for learning interventions through \nthe identification of organizational and indi- \nvidual training and development eeds. Chapter \n8 (Alan Cattell) looks at the use of performance \nmanagement as a mechanism for specifying \ndevelopmental requirements. Chapter 9 (by \nDavid Sawdon) considers the role of internal \nand external consultancy in the identification of \ntraining and development eeds. \nSection 3 includes four contributions: the first \ntwo of these, 'Fundamentals of adult learning' \n(Chris Wiltsher) and 'The adult learning: theory \ninto practice' (by Janet Parr), consider how \nadults learn and how the environment influences \nthe learning process. Cheryl Hunt provides a \nchapter on how to develop the skills to become a\nreflective practitioner as one aspect of pro- \nfessional development. 'Workplace diversity and \ntraining - more than fine words' (Joan E. Keogh) \ninvestigates the issue of diversity. \nSection 4 is made up of five sections. The first of \nthese, by Geoff Chivers, deals with 'Open, distance \nand flexible learning'. Colin Beard and Maggie \nMcPherson then go on to consider the design and \nuse of group-based training methods in Chapter \n15 and (in reverse author order) individualized \ntraining methods in Chapter 16. In the next \nsection, A. Ibarz explores the.issues of language \nand culture in HRD and Dominic Irvine and \nColin Beard complete Section 4 with a contribu- \ntion about problems, paradoxes and perspectives \non management training and development. \nSection 5 has three contributions covering: \ndifferent contemporary approaches to the \nevaluation and assessment of training (Cathie \nEdwards); total quality training and HRD (Ron \nChapman and John P. Wilson) and how to \nbenchmark the quality of training; and account- \ning for the HRD function through balancing \ncost and value (Chris Wiltsher). \nSection 6 also has three contributions. The first \nof these, 'Managing the HRD functions' (Pete \nSayers), looks at the broader issues of managing \nHRD. The second part, 'Marketing HRD' \n(Jennifer Joy-Matthews, Ian Andrews and \nRichard Firth), explores internal and external \nmarketing issues. Finally, 'Supporting learning \nin the third millennium' (Rita Johnson) specu- \nlates on the future of HRD. \nEach of the chapters in this book has an \nextensive bibliography. These are collated at the \nend of the book into an extensive resource, \nwhich while current will be extremely useful or \nHRD professionals. This is a comprehensive \ncollection of theory and practice issues relating \nto HRD which can be read in its entirety, in \nsections or, using the index, can be dipped into \naccording to specific needs. This book makes \ninteresting reading and will be an extremely \nuseful addition to the bookshelf of any HRD \nprofessional. Throughout the book the political \nissue of recognizing humans as resources and \nexploiting them through HRD makes an \ninteresting tension. \nEleri Jones \nUniversity of Wales Institute, Cardiff \n113 \nRenews \nJennifer Moon, Learning Journal.\" A Handbook \nfor Academics, Students and Professional \nDevelopment, London: Kogan Page, 1999. ISBN \n0-7494-3045-1. Paperback, vii+145 pages, \n\u00a315.99. \nThe reader might think it is curious that a book \nwhich appears to be rooted in the 'soft' social \nsciences is worthy of review in this learning \ntechnology journal. Not so; learning technology \nis a 'broad kirk'. Learning technology is only \nsuperficially about the artefacts of communica- \ntions and information technology (CIT)~ At the \nheart of learning technology is a rationale for \nthe design of learning experiences using one or \nmore frameworks that explain learning. Emerg- \ning in the growth of the discipline is the issue of \nthe 'experience of learning'. Too little is really \nknown about what it is like to be a learner. The \ndesign of innovative CIT environments is all too \noften seen from the perspective of the teacher\/ \ntechnologist or worse still, what CIT will permit. \nFurther, very little account is taken of what \ncomprises the experiences or events of learning \nprogrammes. It is fashionable for course \ndesigners to make claims that a module is \n'intended to encourage xchange of experience, \nexchange of ideas, critical reflection and \nevaluation of current experience and practice, \nand to lay the groundwork for continuing \nlearning and reflection', l It appears that the \napproach adopted by many learning \ntechnologists is to expect and require learners to \napply what they learn across different si uations \nand to bring to their study a raft of experiences \nthat produce an instantiation of taught \nprinciples. This book by Jenny Moon (and its \ncompanion volume 2) are timely as they provide \nthe philosophy and countless examples for the \nrecording of experience in learning journals. So \nwhat is a 'learning journal'? Learning journals, \nreflection journals, personal portfolios and \nlearning logbooks are a form of recording the \nexperience or experiences of learning. Such \njournals are common in the professions with \nmany accrediting bodies requiring graduates to \nmaintain a record of professional development \nas part of their accreditation process. Learning \njournals record personal stories written by \nlearners who find it useful to record their \nthinking, but why? \nThe journal is a key part of the Experiential \nLearning Framework popularized by David \nKolb 3 and more often referred to than under- \nstood by countless learning technologists and \ninstructional designers. Their uses, as Moon \npoints out, are xtensive: for example, to record \nexperience, to facilitate learning, to support \nunderstanding and the representation f under- \nstanding, and probably most important, \namongst a list of eighteen uses, to encourage \nmeta-cognition. Recording of thinking about \nlearning and the experiences of learning create a \ndeeper sense of being a learner. Quite a claim - \nbut reflection is a ubiquitous concept. One can \ntrace the importance of reflection and experi- \nences in learning back to Aristotle. In the \nseventeenth century Hobbes wrote 'all know- \nledge is gained through experiences'. 4 Reflection \non experiences i important in problem-based \nlearning. For example, the importance of reflec- \ntion in response to puzzling situations is crucial \nto Dewey.5 \nSo, the learning journal is a vehicle for \nreflection. But, what is reflection? While almost \nevery one thinks, the act of reflection in action, \non action and for action 6 is a meta-cognitive skill \nthat bridges the gap between learning experi- \nences and conceptualization r theory-building. \nReflection in a journal is a written record of \nprivate conversation that makes sense of events \nas they occur. Reflection and journalling are well \ndescribed in a number of recent books and the \nreader is advised to consult the second Moon \nbook or one of the others in the Endnote to this \nreview. 7\nWhat then is the place for such a book in a \nlearning technologist's bookshelf? The book is \nmore than a cookbook; rather it is a self- \ninstructional manual for the designer. However, I \nam not sure if this book is essential or desirable \nreading for the average learner. It is worth \ndwelling on this point for a moment before \nsaying why the book has a place on the \ndesigner's desktop not bookshelf! The most \nimmediate metaphor that comes to mind is that \nof the centipede who, having discovered it had \n100 legs immediately fell over. It is not so \nimportant for the learner to know why they \nmight reflect - rather it is more important to be \nable to reflect. Reflection is a competence. Of \ncourse, it is clear that the actualized learner will \nwant to know what learning is and how to make \nthe most of it. I feel that this book and certainly \nits companion may be too much of a mirror to \nthe unsteady learner to serve any real value, \nOthers may disagree. This book is for the \ndesigner who should use it to inform their \ninstructional strategies. It is a manual for the \nlearning technologist. \n114 \nAIr~-] Volume 9 Number I \nTo begin with, the book offers six useful chapters \nthat introduce the art of journal writing and its \nsubsequent effect on learning and an extensive \ntreatment of the uses and possibilities for \njournalling. The book suggests that learning \nexperiences can be captured using whatever \ndesign paradigm is chosen. There is an \nimportant chapter (Chapter 7) that explains how \nto start a journal. Writer's block is a common \nproblem for journalists. In presenting the task of \njournaUing to the learner, the designer needs to \noffer opportunities and exemplars. Good design \nneeds to allow learners the opportunity to draw \non experience as well as generalizing from \nexperiences. Exemplars uggest he boundaries \nfor journalling. The most difficult job the \ndesigner encounters is to provide sufficient \nexamples of how to journal. Chapters 8 and 9 \noffer a good range of possibilities. The last \nchapter aises the issue that the journal is not an \nend in itself, rather it is another opportunity to \nfacilitate learning. Reflection, like so much else \nin study skills, can be acquired at a variety of \ndifferent levels of competence. The reflective \njournalist is on a learning curve with regard to \nlearning as well as domain-specific skills. So far I \nhave not mentioned Chapter 7. Moon jumps \nwhere others fear to tread. There is a consider- \nable literature on the ethics and 'practicks' of\nassessing journals. Some argue that it is both \nunethical and impractical to make judgements of \nwhat are private journal entries. Both formative \nand summative assessment of reflection journals \nhave been implemented. It is too complex an \nissue to deal with here rather, the reader is \nrecommended to think of self-assessment for \nlearners as another design strategy. 8 Read \nChapter 7 with care as it may change your \nattitude to assessment. \nThe book is easy to read. It is well referenced. \nThere is a short index. With only 133 pages of \ntext, the book is not cheap at \u00a315.99. So, is it a \nbook for the bookshelf in the library or, worse \nstill, for the bookshelf in the bookshop or, is it \nfor the desktop? I use this book myself. I have \nused it to source ideas on how to introduce \njournalling, I have used it to stimulate my \nthinking about assessment. I have used it to \ncomfort me when I have decided to implement \njournalling in a course. It is certainly a text that \nlearning technologists should use. It is for the \ndesktop; not only does it offer comfort and \nreassurance when reflecting for accreditation by \nILT, it offers practical examples of how to make \ninstructional design more effective in order to \nprecipitate l arning in students. \nRay McAleese \nHeriot- Watt University \nNotes \n~Taken from a descriptor f om a masters degree \nmodule taught by a university. \n2.1.
