Introduction\n[2] The circulation of the northwest European continental\nshelf (Figure 1) has been the subject of intense investiga-\ntion, because of its importance to the major northern\nEuropean fisheries; a canonical schematic of the circulation\nin the North Sea derived from a variety of observations is\npresented in Figure 2 (reproduced from OSPAR [2000], after\nTurrell et al. [1992]). The earliest studies focused on the\ntide and wind-driven circulation, but it has long been known\nthat, just as in the deep ocean, horizontal density gradients\nplay a significant role. The subtidal circulation of shelf seas\nis composed of a combination of tidal residuals, wind (and\natmospheric pressure)-driven currents, and density-driven\ncurrents. These forcing mechanisms all have local and\nnonlocal manifestations; the imposed stresses and pressure\ngradients are local effects, while the propagation of coast-\nally trapped waves is the nonlocal (free) response to this\nforcing. In the context of regional scale modeling, the\noceanic boundary conditions imposed on a model can form\na significant part of the nonlocal forcing. The objective of\nthis work is to identify the relative importance of the wind-,\ndensity-, and oceanic-driven circulation to the shelf-wide\nspace- and seasonal time-scale transport across the north-\nwest European continental shelf. For this purpose, a high\nresolution application of the Proudman Oceanographic\nLaboratory Coastal Ocean Modeling System [POLCOMS;\nHolt and James, 2001] is employed.\n[3] Since the pioneering work of Heaps and Jones [1969]\nand Simpson and Hunter [1974], there has been increasing\ninvestigation of the density-driven circulation in these shelf\nseas particularly with the development of satellite-tracked\ndrifters, undulating Conductivity Temperature Depth sen-\nsors (CTDs), accurate Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers\n(ADCPs) and, more recently, gliders. These observational\ntechniques have been used to identify, on a case by case\nbasis, a series of intense subsurface jets around the frontal\nregions of the northwest European shelf, these generally\noccur just above the bottom front where the thermocline\ncurves down to the seabed. Examples of these jets include:\nthe cyclonic gyre in the western Irish Sea [Hill et al., 1994];\nthe frontal jets in the St. George\u2019s Channel [Brown et al.,\n2003; Horsburgh et al., 1998], western English Channel\n(see http:\/\/www.cefas.co.uk\/Publications\/files\/AE1225_\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 113, C06021, doi:10.1029\/2006JC004034, 2008\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory, Liverpool, UK.\nPublished in 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.\nC06021 1 of 20\nFigure 1.

While these smaller (transverse)\nscale (\u000110 to 20 km) features have been intensively studied,\nthe relative role of density- and wind-driven currents on\nlarge space\/timescales has yet to be established.\n[4] The characteristic scale of the density structure is the\ninternal Rossby radius, LR = [g\n0h1h2\/(h1 + h2)]\n1\/2\/f for a two-\nlayer system with reduced gravity g0 and layer depths h =\nh1 + h2; typically 2\u20135 km on the shelf and \u000114 km in\nthe Norwegian Trench. The actual transverse scale of density\ndriven currents also depends on the diffusive spreading of the\ndensity structure beyond the initial width of adjustment. The\nscale of coastal currents driven by freshwater sources is\ndetermined by a combination of bottom topography, input\nflux, and vertical and horizontal diffusion [Chapman, 2000;\nChapman and Lentz, 1994; Narayanan and Garvine, 2002].\nThe largest such current in this region is the Norwegian\nCoastal Current (\u000185 km wide off the southern coast of\nNorway), an intense poleward current along the Norwegian\ncoast carrying North Sea water recirculated in the Skaggerak\nand fresher water from the Baltic.\n[5] The subsurface jets at tidal mixing fronts arise from\nthe tendency for friction to retard the bottom component of\nthe baroclinic flow associated with the frontal density\nstructure, resulting in a subsurface cyclonic circulation\nabove the bottom front; i.e., with mixed water to the right\nof the current [Garrett and Loder, 1981; Hill, 1996]. The\nhorizontal width of these flows (typically 10\u201320 km) is\ndetermined by the frontal density structure, which in turn\ndepends on a range of cross-frontal exchange processes.\nBased on these scales, the model resolution for this study is\nchosen to be \u00011.8 km. Hence on the shelf, this model is\n\u2018\u2018eddy-permitting\u2019\u2019 rather than \u2018\u2018eddy-resolving\u2019\u2019 in the\nsense that motions at the Rossby radius are included but\nnot well resolved. An eddy-resolving model would require\na resolution of finer than 200 m and would draw into\nquestion the hydrostatic approximation applied in this\nmodel.\n[6] The frontal positions on the shelf can be defined by the\nhorizontal gradients of the potential energy anomaly\n(Figure 3). This represents the energy required to completely\nmix the water column and is given by:\nf \u00bc \u0004 g\nh\nZ 0\nz\u00bc\u0004h\nz r T ; S\u00f0 \u00de \u0004 r \u0001T ; \u0001S\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00dedz; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere r is the density and an over-bar indicates a depth\nmean [Simpson and Bowers, 1981]. The frontal positions\nclosely match those frontal positions presented by Pingree\nand Griffiths [1977] from the application of Simpson and\nHunter\u2019s [1974] \u2018\u2018h\/u3\u2019\u2019 criteria to a depth averaged tidal\nmodel, which in turn shows good agreement with\nclimatological observations [Bowers and Simpson, 1987].\nFigure 3. Potential energy anomaly (log scale) from this model simulation (1 August 2001).\nC06021 HOLT AND PROCTOR: VOLUME TRANSPORT ON THE EUROPEAN SHELF\n3 of 20\nC06021\nThe horizontal gradients in potential energy anomaly also\ngive an indication of the strength of the density-driven\ncirculation, so from the frontal positions on Figure 3 it can\nbe inferred that subsurface jets have a role in transporting\nmaterial in each of the seas covered by this model domain.\n[7] Model studies are ideal for investigating the compo-\nsition of the circulation, since the wind\/tide\/density contri-\nbutions cannot generally be established unambiguously\nfrom observations. Moreover, observations cannot provide\na synoptic view on a shelf-wide scale. A number of\nbaroclinic modeling systems have been used to investigate\nthe circulation of this region. These typically have resolu-\ntions of 7\u201320 km, and are run for both operational and\nresearch purposes. Examples include the Hybrid Coordinate\nOcean Model (HYCOM), \u00017 km [Winther and Evensen,\n2006], the Hamburg Shelf Ocean Model (HAMSOM) at\n\u000120 km resolution [Backhaus and Hainbucher, 1987], the\nPrinceton Ocean Model (POM) at \u000120 km [Skogen and\nSoiland, 1998] and POLCOMS at \u00017 km [Holt et al., 2005;\nSiddorn et al., 2007]. These modeling studies generally\nagree with the expected circulation pattern on the northwest\nEuropean shelf derived from observational studies: through-\nout the region the currents tend to follow the direction of\n(barotropic and baroclinic) Kelvin wave propagation. This\nflow orientation is true for the tidal, wind-driven and\ncoastal-current circulations (with the coast to the right of\nthe current), and frontal jets with well-mixed waters to the\nright of the current. Since well-mixed water tends to be\nshoreward of the frontal jet, all mechanisms drive currents\nin the same direction, a possible source of ambiguity when\nattempting to identify the forcing mechanism. This flow\norientation is not the case for isolated banks (such as\nDogger Bank) and fronts there can drive currents in the\nopposite direction to the large scale circulation [e.g., Brown\net al., 1999]. While the general patterns have been repro-\nduced, direct comparisons between model currents and\ncontemporary observations are rare and have not yet been\ncarried out on a shelf-wide scale.\n[8] To date there are no published model studies of the\ndensity-driven circulation across the whole of the northwest\nEuropean shelf region shown in Figure 1 that includes\nmotions at the scale of the internal Rossby radius; i.e., are\neddy-permitting. In this work a fine-resolution shelf-wide\napplication of POLCOMS is employed in a study of an\nannual cycle. Unlike in previous model studies of this\nregion the resolution considered here is fine enough to\nresolve the details of the density-driven frontal circulation,\nwhile the scale is large enough to include all the frontal\nsystems on the shelf and also the large-scale circulation. In\nthe geostrophic limit the net volume flux across a section is\nonly dependent on the pressure difference between the\nbeginning and end of the section; hence resolution is not\nnecessarily important in determining the large scale trans-\nport, as long as the sea level and density structure are well\nrepresented. However, the detailed structure of the currents\nin frontal jets is strongly resolution dependent, and the\nbottom topography and friction both tend to make this\nstructure important to the larger scale volume transport.\nOne of the objectives of this paper is to identify the\nimportance of these effects, which have been detailed\nlocally by a range of observational studies [e.g., Brown et\nal., 2003; Hill et al., 1994; Lwiza et al., 1991].\n[9] To validate this model simulation satellite tracked\ndrifter observations (Figure 2) are used to provide a direct\ncomparison in the central North Sea and Irish Shelf regions.\nA semiqualitative comparison with volume transport esti-\nmates in the literature is made to assess the fluxes across the\nwhole model domain.\n[10] The model experiments are described in the next\nsection and the shelf-wide circulation pattern is described in\nsection 3. Volume transport across a number of sections is\ninvestigated in section 4 and conclusions drawn in section 5.\n2. Model Description, Experiments and\nDiagnostics\n[11] We use the POLCOMS to simulate the region shown in\nFigure 1 on a 1\/60\u0001 latitude by 1\/40\u0001 longitude grid (\u00011.8 km),\nwith 34 vertical s-coordinate levels [Song and Haidvogel,\n1994]. This configuration is known as the High Resolution\nContinental Shelf (HRCS) model. POLCOMS is a B-grid\nfinite difference model with prognostic temperature and salin-\nity, and a sophisticated advection scheme [the \u2018\u2018Piecewise\nParabolicMethod\u2019\u2019; James, 1996]. The model is fully described\nby Holt and James [2001], so these details will not be\nrepeated here. The model is forced by 6-hourly European\nCentre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF)\natmospheric model data, using bulk formulae [Gill, 1982;\nSmith and Banke, 1975] to prescribe surface fluxes. This\nmodel simulation utilizes a substantially improved (over\nprevious POLCOMS applications) river flow database com-\nposed of \u0001300 rivers discharging into the region, gauged\nat up to daily frequency. The simulation period is from\n1 January to 31 December 2001 and a multiyear (1998\u2013\n2001) simulation of the POLCOMS Atlantic Margin Model\nat \u000112 km resolution (AMM; Figure 1) provides initial\nconditions and contemporary boundary data for HRCS\n(AMM is in turn forced by the North Atlantic FOAM\nModel [Bell et al., 2000]). The boundary data consist of\nhourly elevations and depth mean currents, and daily depth-\nvarying currents, temperature and salinity. These data are\nimposed around the irregular open boundary (chosen to\nfollow the 200 m isobath apart from where it crosses the\nNorwegian Trench) using a flux\/radiation scheme for the\nbarotropic component and an up-wind advection scheme for\ntemperature and salinity. The inclusion of the momentum\nadvection term at the velocity points next to the open\nboundary acts as a \u2018\u2018Sommerfeld\u2019\u2019 type boundary condition\n[Sommerfeld, 1949], which facilitates the propagation of\nenergy out of the domain. The results from AMM also\nprovide a comparison with a coarser resolution model.\n[12] Experiments with an application of POLCOMS to\nthe seas west of the UK [Holt and James, 2006] demon-\nstrated the utility of a scale selective horizontal diffusion\nformulation in preventing excessive baroclinic eddy activity\nin open stratified waters during the summer. Hence all the\nexperiments here use a Laplacian diffusion term (on s-levels),\nwith a diffusivity calculated following Smagorinsky [1963]\nand a horizontal turbulent Prandtl number of 2.0. Holt\nand James [2006] demonstrate a particular sensitivity of\nthe baroclinic eddy field produced by the model to the\narbitrary parameter in the Smagorinsky formulation, a = 0.2\nin this work (this value was also used by Young et al.\n[2004]). Hence this parameter sensitivity needs to be kept in\nC06021 HOLT AND PROCTOR: VOLUME TRANSPORT ON THE EUROPEAN SHELF\n4 of 20\nC06021\nmind when considering the fine scale currents presented\nhere. Holt and James [2006] also present an investigation\nof horizontal pressure gradient error in eddy-permitting\ns-coordinate models, demonstrating that calculating this\nterm by interpolation onto horizontal planes (as is the case\nhere), along with scale selective horizontal diffusivity,\nsubstantially reduces this error.\n[13] Three 1-year-long model experiments, listed in\nTable 1, are considered here. All these experiments use\nidentical open boundary forcing including any baroclinic\neffects, since these experiments are not run for AMM. By\nsequentially subtracting the results of these experiments we\ncan divide the currents into density (uD), barotropic-wind\n(uW) and barotropic-oceanic (uO) driven components. La-\nbeling the experiments with subscripts 1, 2, and 3:\nuD \u00bc u1 \u0004 u2\nuw \u00bc u2 \u0004 u3\nuO \u00bc u3\nu \u00bc u1\nso\nu \u00bc uD \u00fe uW \u00fe uO \u00f02\u00de\nDividing the currents in this way does not separate out the\nnonlinear effects; thus it is only an approximate indication of\nthe relative importance of the terms, and none of these\ncomponents are independent of the others. For example, in\naddition to the currents that result directly from internal\npressure fields, which can be estimated from the thermal\nwind equations (discussed later), the density component\nincludes any current speed that results from stratification\nreducing the frictional effects on the wind-driven circulation.\n[14] POLCOMS applications on the northwest European\nshelf, has been validated against a wide range of observa-\ntions; the model data comparison presented by Holt et al.\n[2005] used an application of the model (MRCS) differing\nonly in resolution (four times coarser horizontally and with\nfewer vertical levels than HRCS) and compared the model\nresults with extensive observations from the 1988\u201389 North\nSea Project [Charnock et al., 1994], AVHRR and historical\ncurrent meters and tide gauges. Improved forcing (boundary\nconditions and river fluxes), might be expected to lead to an\nimprovement in the simulation (this has been confirmed for\nthe residual current and salinity simulation in MRCS, not\nreported here); it is our intention to repeat this comprehen-\nsive validation exercise with HRCS in the near future.\nHowever, issues relating to surface flux and vertical mixing\nparameterizations are likely to remain, for example the\ntendency to underestimate the thermocline depth. A brief\ncomparison with the 1829 high-resolution CTD casts avail-\nable for 2001 in the model domain (primarily in the North\nSea and Skagerrak) from the ICES database (http:\/\/www.\nices.dk\/ocean\/dotnet\/HydChem\/HydChem.aspx) gives an\nRMS and mean error of 1.1\u0001C and \u00040.6\u0001C (model too\ncool) respectively; i.e., similar uncertainties to those pre-\nsented by Holt et al.

The\ndrifters have a 5.5 m drogue centered at 30m depth. Subtidal\ndrifter velocities are estimated using a method similar to that\ndescribed by Horsburgh et al. [2000]. The drifter positions\nare linearly interpolated to give an hourly time series. This\nis filtered using a Doodson X0 filter [IOC, 1985] to remove\nenergy at semidiurnal and diurnal tidal frequencies. Veloc-\nities are then calculated by finite difference and averaged to\ngive daily 25 h means. After measurements below\n0.01 ms\u00041 and in water depths shallower than 40 m have\nbeen removed this provides a total of 688 velocity measure-\nments. The model currents, averaged between 20 and 40m\ndepths, at the corresponding horizontal location and time are\nextracted to give a direct comparison (Table 2).\n3. Shelf Scale Circulation\n[16] The subtidal currents (25 h means centered on\n11:30UTC) averaged for July to September and over the\ndepth interval: (1) top 20 m, (2) 20 m to 40 m, and (3) 40 m\nto seabed are shown in Figure 4. These summer mean\ncurrents demonstrate that the modeled North Sea circulation\nclosely matches that shown in Figure 2 in many respects,\nalthough much of the density-driven circulation captured\nby high-resolution observations, such as the flow around\nDogger Bank [Brown et al., 1999; Lwiza et al., 1991], is\nmissing from Figure 2. These high-resolution model results\nindicate that the circulation across the shelf is made of many\nsmall scale structures; the largest currents appear as fila-\nment-like jets, with high spatial coherence. An exception is\nFigure 4a. Summer mean horizontal circulation averaged: (a) near surface (0\u201320 m), (b) middepth\n(20\u201340 m), and (c) bottom (40-m seabed).

In all seasons, water from the North Sea enters the\nSkagerrak in three distinct branches: from the north the\nDooley Current [Lwiza et al., 1991; Svendsen et al., 1991]\nretroflects to join the current along the western side of the\nNorwegian Trench, along the 40m isobath east of Dogger\nBank, and in a northward current close to the Danish coast.\nThese currents all join to follow the steep topography\naround the Skagerrak and form the Norwegian Costal\nCurrent, augmented by fresher water from the Baltic. The\nNorwegian Coastal Current is the strongest current in the\nregion and contains two persistent eddy features at \u000158.9\u0001N\n(comparable to those observed by Johannessen et al.\n[1989]). The shape of the Dooley current seen in Figure 4a\nis very similar to that shown by Svendsen et al. [1991]\nand corresponds to the 100m isobath, indicating a role of\ntopography in steering the current most probably through the\ntendency of the flow to conserve potential vorticity and\nfollow f\/h contours. Comparing Figures 4a, 4b, and 4c it\ncan be seen that much of the northern North Sea circulation\ndoes not vary greatly with depth, for example the topograph-\nically steered eddy north of the Dooley current is barotropic\nas previously identified from observations by Svendsen et al.\n[1991]. The clockwise circulation around Dogger Bank is\nmore apparent in the 20\u201340m depth interval (Figure 4b) than\nat the surface. An important feature that is apparent in the\nnear bottom currents (Figure 4c), but not seen at the surface,\nis the Atlantic inflow on the west side of the Norwegian\nTrench.\n[17] On the western side of the model domain, from\nBrittany in the south to the Fair Isle Channel north of\nScotland, the currents generally follow the coastline (flow-\ning with the coast on the right), except where the currents\nseparate from the coast to follow the fronts in the English\nChannel, St. George\u2019s Channel and North Channel. At each\nFigure 4b. See caption on Figure 4a.\nC06021 HOLT AND PROCTOR: VOLUME TRANSPORT ON THE EUROPEAN SHELF\n7 of 20\nC06021\nof these fronts, the flow structure is complex owing both to\neddy activity at the front and tidal rectification at the\nheadlands [Pingree et al., 1982]. Particularly apparent is\nthe Irish Coastal current [Fernand et al., 2006] and the\nSt. George\u2019s Channel frontal jet [Brown et al., 2003]. The\njet across the English Channel is less well defined because\nthe front there extends close to the Cherbourg Peninsular,\nand the frontal flow is masked by the strong tidally rectified\nflow in this region.\n[18] To examine the structure of the currents in the North\nSea in more detail, Figure 5 shows vertical cross-sections of\ncurrents and density (25 h mean on 1 August 2001; chosen\nto represent the peak of the summer heating cycle) along a\nsection from the Dutch coast to the Shetlands (section A in\nFigure 1). The density section (Figure 5a) shows the Rhine\nplume, a number of tidal mixing fronts and temperature\nstratified regions with reasonably flat pycnoclines. A qual-\nitative comparison with undulating CTD (Scanfish) obser-\nvations from the central North Sea [Brown et al., 1999,\nFigure 7] suggests that the vertical structure is reasonably\nwell represented: the pyconocline is between 20 and 40 m\ndeep in the observations and 14 and 35 m in this model; i.e.,\nits width is well represented but the pycnocline is too\nshallow in common with similar model studies in this region\n[e.g., Luyten et al., 2003]. However, this comparison is\nprobably an exceptional case as Scanfish observations in\nother regions [e.g. Figure 5, in Brown et al., 1999] generally\nshow a much sharper pycnocline than the model.\n[19] The across section currents (Figure 5b) have a\ncomplex structure both in the vertical, and along the section,\nwhere there are a number of reversals to the generally\neastward current. When the density-driven component is\nestimated from Equation 2 (Figure 5c), it is evident that it\naccounts for many of the currents seen here and in most\ncases is in the same direction as the total current.\nFigure 4c. See caption on Figure 4a.\nC06021 HOLT AND PROCTOR: VOLUME TRANSPORT ON THE EUROPEAN SHELF\n8 of 20\nC06021\n[20] It is enlightening to see what proportion of this\ndensity component is directly attributable to a geostrophic\nbalance with the local density field. This can be estimated\nby integrating the thermal wind equations:\n@ug\n@z\n\u00bc g\nrf\n@r\n@y\n@vg\n@z\n\u00bc \u0004 g\nrf\n@r\n@x\n; \u00f03\u00de\nassuming zero current at the seabed (the density component\nis very small here except near the coast).The geostrophic\ncomponent is estimated in this way since it matches the\nmethod used in observational studies (as justified by Hill\n[1996]). This geostrophic component correlates well with\nthe full density-driven component (for this section r2 = 0.72\nat the surface and 0.49 overall), although there are\nsignificant differences in the amplitude of the currents.\nFor example the maximum density-driven component in the\nDooley Current is \u00010.16 ms\u00041 compared with a maximum\nof 0.22 ms\u00041 in the geostrophic component. The Dooley\nCurrent occurs close to a bottom front (marked by an arrow\nFigure 5. Vertical section from the Dutch coast (south) to the Shetland Isles (north) of density and\ncurrents, across section A (Figure 1) for 1 August 2001. Eastward flow is shown as solid contours,\nwestward as dotted. The interval is 0.02 ms\u00041. (a) Density, (b) across-section total current, (c) across-\nsection density-driven component (uD), and (d) geostrophic current, (ug). The Rhine plume is marked by\nR and the Dooley current bottom front is marked by an arrow at \u000157.7\u0001N.\nC06021 HOLT AND PROCTOR: VOLUME TRANSPORT ON THE EUROPEAN SHELF\n9 of 20\nC06021\non Figure 5a), and the density and current structure seen at\nthis location is very similar to that observed by Svendsen et\nal. [1991]. The current here can be explained as an\ninteraction between the barotropic wind\/oceanic-driven\ncirculation and the density field. A topographically steered\nbarotropic current is present here throughout the year. As\nstratification develops in the spring, the shear generated by\nthis current forms a bottom front. The resulting density field\naccelerates a current in the same direction that is stronger\nthan the original barotropic current.\n[21] Many of the smaller scale structures seen in both the\ndensity component of the current and the geostrophic\nestimate (e.g., between 55.7\u0001N and 56.6\u0001N) can be attrib-\nuted to anticyclonic baroclinic eddies seen in the daily mean\nsurface current fields (not shown).\n[22] The comparison with drifter velocity measurements\n(Table 2) indicates that the RMS difference between the\naverage observed and modeled speed for each drifter is\n0.034 ms\u00041 (a fractional error of \u000146%), but this is\nconsistently biased to the model underestimating the mean\nspeed. The RMS difference between the individual daily\nmean modeled and observed speeds is \u00010.08 ms\u00041, a\npercentage error of \u000180%. Indicating that, while the current\nspeeds averaged over \u000140 d are reasonably well modeled,\nthe higher frequency variability is less accurately simulated.\nThe RMS difference between the observed and modeled\naverage direction for each drifter is 39\u0001T. Examining the\ndistribution of errors in the direction indicates that, of the\n688 individual observations, \u000150% are accurate to \u00b145\u0001T\nand \u000180% are accurate to \u00b190\u0001T.\n4. Volume Transport\n[23] The depth integrated volume fluxes (h\u0001uhi; where\nbrackets indicate a time average) give a useful indication\nof the capacity of these currents to transport material, e.g.,\nFigure 6a. Depth integrated volume transport averaged from July to September. Density-driven\ncomponent. For clarity only vectors at every 12th grid points are shown.\nC06021 HOLT AND PROCTOR: VOLUME TRANSPORT ON THE EUROPEAN SHELF\n10 of 20\nC06021\nnutrients, suspended material, contaminants and biota. This\nis only an approximate indication since correlations be-\ntween the spatial and temporal current and concentration\nstructure are often important. The volume transport can be\ndivided into density, wind driven and oceanic components\nas in equation (2) and the summer mean of each of these\n(Figures 6a\u20136c) shows a distinct spatial structure. The\ndensity component (Figure 6a) is demonstrably the domi-\nnant constituent across most of the shelf in this season: the\naverage magnitude of the density-driven transport over the\nmodel domain is 2.5 m2s\u00041 compared with 1.9 m2s\u00041 for\nthe oceanic-driven and 0.8 m2s\u00041 for the wind-driven\ncomponents. The density-driven component shows signifi-\ncantly more fine scale structure than the wind- or oceanic-\ndriven components and is responsible for most of the\nsinuous jets seen in Figure 4. Both the wind- and oceanic-\ndriven components (Figures 6b\u20136c) show transport with a\nmuch larger (across-flow) horizontal scale, consistent with\nthe propagation of barotropic coastally trapped waves (see\nbelow), but as is seen later this does not necessarily result in\ngreater transport across sections.\n[24] To examine the temporal variation of the transport,\nFigure 7 demonstrates how the volume flux across section\nA, (Figure 1) varies over the annual cycle. Values for the\nthree components of velocity (equation (2)) are shown. In\neach component, there is a predominantly eastward trans-\nport, but with a very different temporal and spatial structure.\nThe wind-driven component (Figure 7a) has a high degree\nof temporal variability, but strong spatial coherence along\nthe section; this variability reflects the synoptic scale\natmospheric forcing. The lack of spatial variability possibly\nreflects the coarse resolution of the ECMWF atmospheric\nmodel data; at 1\u0001 resolution, any effects of the horizontal\nstructure of weather systems are not well represented. The\nstrongest wind-driven fluxes are in bands south of 54\u0001N,\nbetween 56.8\u0001N and 58.2\u0001N and north of 59\u0001N. Occasional\nwestward fluxes are apparent in each of these bands. There\nis a weak seasonal cycle, with strongest fluxes in winter and\nFigure 6b. Depth integrated volume transport averaged from July to September. Wind-driven\ncomponent. For clarity only vectors at every 12th grid points are shown.\nC06021 HOLT AND PROCTOR: VOLUME TRANSPORT ON THE EUROPEAN SHELF\n11 of 20\nC06021\nautumn. The oceanic-driven component (Figure 7c) shows\ncurrents at very similar locations to the wind driven com-\nponent. This component is made up of the residual oceanic\nforcing and tidal rectification by frictional and advective\nprocesses on the shelf, so it is modulated by the spring-neap\ncycle in near coastal waters and includes the effects of\nheadland eddies close to the coast (e.g., the westward flow\naround the southern tip of the Shetland Isles at the northern\nend of section A).\n[25] In contrast to the wind- and oceanic-driven compo-\nnents, the density-driven component of the volume flux\n(Figure 7b) occurs on seasonal scales and is comparatively\nslowly varying. The average volume transport from July to\nSeptember for section A is presented in Figure 8 in two parts\n(A1 and A2). At the southern end of the section (A2) the\ntransport of the Rhine plume is evident in the density-driven\ncomponent, which makes the largest contribution to the\ntotal. North of this is a broad eastward current with both\noceanic- andwind-driven components. The horizontal scale of\nthis broad eastward current is \u000186 km, which is consistent\nwith a barotropic coastally trapped wave ((gh)0.5\/f\u0001 100 km).\nNorth of the broad wind- and oceanic-driven current is a\ntight eastward density driven jet of width \u000116 km at the\nsouthern tidal mixing front. On the south flank of Dogger\nBank is a broader westward density-driven current, while\nnorth of Dogger Bank is the eastward current observed by\nBrown et al. [1999]. The dominant feature in section A1 is\nthe Dooley current between 57.5\u0001N and 58\u0001N. This is made\nup of all three components, with the density-driven compo-\nnent being the largest. The westward transport north of\n58\u0001N is associated with the retroflection of the Dooley\ncurrent seen in Figure 4 and is almost entirely density-\ndriven. The ratio of the mean flux to its standard deviation\nfor July to September gives an indication of the variability\nof the transport across this section. For the southern\nsection (A2) this is 0.62 for the total flux, 0.20 for the\nFigure 6c. Depth integrated volume transport averaged from July to September. Oceanic-driven\ncomponent. For clarity only vectors at every 12th grid points are shown.\nC06021 HOLT AND PROCTOR: VOLUME TRANSPORT ON THE EUROPEAN SHELF\n12 of 20\nC06021\nFigure 7. Time series of depth mean transport across section A: (a) wind-driven component, (b) density-\ndriven component, and (c) oceanic-driven component.\nC06021 HOLT AND PROCTOR: VOLUME TRANSPORT ON THE EUROPEAN SHELF\n13 of 20\nC06021\nwind-driven component, 0.7 for the density-driven compo-\nnent and 1.22 for the oceanic-driven component. For the\nnorthern section (A1) these ratios are: total 0.79; wind 0.21;\ndensity 0.69; oceanic 0.69. These results confirm that the\nwind component is substantially more variable that the other\ntwo.\n[26] The strongest density-driven component of the flux\nacross section A (Figure 7b) is in the late summer\/autumn\nand examining the seasonal evolution of the stratification\n(Figure 9) indicates that this corresponds to regions of high\ngradient in potential energy anomaly that arise during the\nbreakdown of stratification. This breakdown takes a number\nof months, so the corresponding currents are persistent, but\nvary in position. A prominent feature in this density-driven\nflux is at \u000158\u0001N (Figure 7), corresponding to the northern\nflank of the Dooley current. There is no well-defined tidal\nmixing front in this region; however, as noted in section 3\n(Figure 5) there is enhanced mixing and a bottom front here;\nFigure 9 shows a minimum in potential energy anomaly at\n\u000157.5\u0001N from about day 250, and that stratification be-\ntween 57\u0001N and 58\u0001N breaks down significantly earlier than\nthe regions to the north or south, about day 300 compared\nwith 350. This region of reduced stratification occurs as the\nfront near the east coast of Scotland migrates eastward\nforming an intrusion into the main stratified region of the\nnorthern North Sea (Figure 11 shows how the frontal\nFigure 8. Components of the summer mean volume flux across section A2 (southern North Sea);\nsection A1 (central and northern North Sea). Positive values indicate eastward flow. The depth scale is\nshown on the right hand axis.\nC06021 HOLT AND PROCTOR: VOLUME TRANSPORT ON THE EUROPEAN SHELF\n14 of 20\nC06021\npositions change with time). The intense density component\nof the Dooley current (\u000158\u0001N) is on the northern flank\nof this region of enhanced mixing and moves northward,\nwith time, following the front as the intrusion progresses\neastward.\n[27] To examine the resolution dependence of these\nvolume transports, Figure 10 compares the fluxes across\nsection A for the 1.8 km resolution model (HRCS) and the\n12 km model (AMM), which supplies the boundary con-\nditions. There is good agreement between the large scale\nfluxes in the two cases, as would be expected for currents in\ngeostrophic balance and determined by the large-scale\npressure gradients. However, there are a number of impor-\ntant differences. In the southern part of the section, the\neastward flow near the continental coast is composed of at\nleast three distinct jets in the higher resolution model\nbecause of the better resolution of the frontal structures\nhere. Similarly, the westward flow south of Dogger Bank is\nmore clearly defined. In the northern part there is again\nsignificantly more fine scale variability in the high resolu-\ntion model, but also the location of the Dooley current is\nshifted southwards in the 1.8 km model compared with the\n12 km model, although the strength is very similar. This\nshift arises from the minimum in potential energy anomaly\nbeing moved southwards in HRCS compared with AMM.\nThe flow reversal north of the Dooley current is hardly seen\nin the 12 km model, again arising from changes in the\ndetails of the stratification relative to this section.\n[28] To examine the volume fluxes in other regions of the\nshelf and to compare the overall importance of the various\ncomponents, the seasonal mean transports across all of the\nsections shown in Figure 12 are listed in Tables 3\u20135.\nDuring the winter months (January to March) the oceanic-\ndriven, and in some cases wind-driven components, tend to\ndominate. The density-driven component is significant in a\nnumber of regions during this season, particularly at the\nshelf edge where it tends to retard the total transport; this is\nseen throughout the year for the Irish Shelf section. At the\nHebrides shelf and Irish shelf sections in winter, the wind-\nand density-driven components are in close balance leaving\nthe oceanic-driven (boundary condition) component to\nclosely match the total transport. The density-driven com-\nponent becomes more positive in spring and summer.\nExamining the spatial variation of the flux across the Irish\nshelf section (see Figure 6a for the summer fluxes) demon-\nstrates that close to the coast the density component is in a\nnarrow northward and eastward coastal jet as is expected\nfrom the Irish coastal current [Fernand et al., 2006], but\nacross the shelf to the edge of the model domain is a\nsouthward and westward density-driven component. This\ndiscrepancy is most likely a result of the proximity of the\nopen boundary and one possible explanation is that there is\nFigure 9. Time evolution of the potential energy anomaly along section A.\nC06021 HOLT AND PROCTOR: VOLUME TRANSPORT ON THE EUROPEAN SHELF\n15 of 20\nC06021\na significant (negative) density component in the boundary\ncondition sea level, which is balanced by the internal\npressure gradient term in the full model but not in experi-\nments two and three; this sea level gradient would tend\nto increase the along-shelf current in these experiments\nand appear in equation (2) as a retarding density-driven\ncomponent.\n[29] During the winter (Table 3), the wind-driven com-\nponent tends to retard the North Sea inflow and to a lesser\nextent the Dooley current. This retardation is because of a\npredominance of northward winds during the winter. These\nwinds arise from passing low pressure systems (cyclones),\nwhich tend to decrease in strength as they move from west\nto east; i.e., in the eastern part of this domain the cyclones\nhave stronger leading northward winds than trailing south-\nward winds. A similar, but weaker, effect is also seen in the\nautumn (Table 6).\n[30] The density-driven component increases in the\nspring, and, during the summer, it yields a substantial\nfraction of most of the fluxes listed in Table 5. This\ncomponent is proportionately weakest on the Irish and\nHebrides shelves and strongest at the entrance to the\nSt. George\u2019s Channel. During the autumn the wind-driven\ncomponent is substantially more important, although the\ndensity-driven component remains significant.\nFigure 10.

The Dooley\nCurrent in HRCS is indicated by an arrow.\nC06021 HOLT AND PROCTOR: VOLUME TRANSPORT ON THE EUROPEAN SHELF\n16 of 20\nC06021\n[31] Volume transport estimates from the AMM model\nand observational estimates from the literature are also\ngiven in Table 5. It is apparent from these results that the\nHRCS (1.8 km) and AMM (12 km) models give very\nsimilar results for many of these currents. The clearest\ndifference between the two models is the tendency for the\nAMM to underestimate the flow into the Skaggerak during\nthe summer and autumn. The differences between the two\nmodels do not appear to be correlated with the importance\nof the density-driven circulation, indicating that the 12 km\nresolution model is able to reproduce many of the large-\nscale density-driven flows.\n[32] The results presented in Table 5 show that the HRCS\nmodel transports agree well with the available literature\nestimates of volume flux and, while these estimates are from\nsparse measurements, different periods and not exactly co-\nlocated with the model sections, they provide a semiquan-\ntitative validation of the model results, particularly that it\nreproduces the relative strengths of currents reasonably\nwell. Both the Fair Isle Current and the North Sea inflow\nare apparently overestimated, although the modeled flow\ninto the Skagerrak is within the error bounds given by\nDanielssen et al. [1997] and close to the model estimates\ngiven by Roed and Fossum [2004]. It is somewhat re-\nassuring that the one section that is co-located in space and\nfrom the same year as the model run (section 10 across the\nIrish Shelf) gives good agreement with the observations\nfrom Fernand et al. [2006].\n5. Conclusion\n[33] These results demonstrate the diversity of structure,\nand in time and space scales of shelf sea currents, which is\nonly realizable through model simulations that include\nmotions at the scale of the baroclinic Rossby radius.

For example, annual transport associated with the\nDooley Current is found to be 24% wind-driven, 34%\ndensity-driven and 42% determined by the external bound-\nary conditions; in the summer this changes to 20% wind,\n50% density and 30% external. These results are in general\nagreement with the conclusion of Huthnance [1997] that\nthere is \u2018\u2018strong external control\u2019\u2019 on the North Sea circu-\nlation. The importance in the northern North Sea of the\ndensity-driven currents during the break down of stratifica-\ntion in late summer and autumn has been demonstrated.\nMany studies [e.g., Brown et al., 2003] have focused on the\nimportance of density-driven currents at well-defined (and\nwell-located) tidal mixing fronts. As the wind increases and\nconvective mixing is introduced during the autumn, these\nfronts, and their corresponding currents migrate across the\nshelf (Figure 11) and persist over a number of months; in\nmany regions, the stratification is not completely broken\ndown until December. These results suggest that the effects\nof the density-driven circulation are more wide-ranging both\nin terms of time and space than the fixed location of tidal\nmixing fronts might suggest (Figure 11).\n[34] Direct comparisons with subsurface velocities esti-\nmated from 26 satellite tracked drifters indicate that the\nmodeled velocities are accurate to \u000146% when averaged\nover the drifter tracks of \u000140 d duration, compared with\ndaily mean errors of \u000180%. However, the average currents\nare negatively biased (model too slow). This somewhat\ncontradicts the comparison with literature estimates of\ntransport (Table 5), which suggest the model overestimates\nthe transport into the Skagerrak. Given these are subsurface\nobservations during the summer, the source of this bias is\nmost likely an under-estimation of the horizontal density\ngradients and consequently the density component of the\nvelocity. This suggests these model simulations put a lower\nbound on the importance of the density driven flow to the\ntransport in the North Sea.\n[35] The surface and benthic boundary layers play an\nimportant role in determining the density field throughout\nthe year, and the present results demonstrate that the\naccurate modeling of vertical mixing is crucially important\nto the modeling of shelf sea circulation. The details of the\nresults presented here inevitably depend on the particular\nturbulence closure scheme used (in this case a Mellor-\nYamada Level 2.5 closure scheme with an algebraic mixing\nlength and the stability functions given by Deleersnijder\nand Luyten [1994]), and it is often the case that the break\ndown of stratification is less well modeled than its onset\n[e.g., Luyten et al., 2003]. This discrepancy arises from\ninaccuracies in modeling mixing (particularly convection)\nFigure 11.

This result\ngives us some confidence that the coarse-resolution model\nreproduces the large scale circulation features reasonably\nwell in studies where high-resolution is not yet practical, for\nexample in multidecadal simulations and when coupled to\ncomplex ecosystem models. However, it does imply that\nresolution as fine as HRCS is required to simulate some\nimportant shelf sea phenomena. For example, to investigate\nany relationship between the transport of nutrients by\nfrontal jets and enhanced biological production at fronts\n[e.g., Pingree et al., 1982; Richardson et al., 2000].\n[37] This work has not addressed the critical issue of\nlateral mixing between coastal waters and water of Atlantic\norigin, which determines the overall exchange of material\nbetween the land and open-ocean. Such a study requires\nmore than a single annual cycle to be simulated, since the\nflushing time of the North Sea is a substantial fraction of a\nyear; for example Huthnance [1997] suggests a value of\n\u0001290 d, while model estimates by Lenhart and Pohlmann\n[1997] suggest 167 d. Such a study is presently underway.\n[38] Acknowledgments. This work was funded by POL\u2019s core sci-\nence program, Met. Office contract PB\/B3648 and EU-MERSEA-IP (SIP3-\nCT-2003-502885).
