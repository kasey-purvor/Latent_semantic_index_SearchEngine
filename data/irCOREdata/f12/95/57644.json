INTRODUCTION \n Although there has been significant progress in recent years in modelling tides and \nlarge scale circulation in various geographical areas (e.g. Northwest European Continental \nShelf, Davies and Kwong (2000), west coast of Britain, Davies and Jones (1992) (hereafter \nDJ92), Yellow Sea, Naimie et al. (2001), Irish Shelf (Lynch et al (2003,2004)) the main focus \nof this work has been outside the very nearshore coastal domain where \u201cwetting and drying\u201d \n 4 \n(Flather and Hubbert 1989, Ip et al 1998) can occur during the tidal cycle. However it must \nbe mentioned that there has been some recent work using high resolution meshes in the \nnearshore of the Bay of Fundy (Greenberg et al, 2005, Dupont et al 2005).  The main reason \nfor this focus on regions where \u201cwetting and drying\u201d does not occur has been the coarse grid \nnature of these models (e.g. DJ92) which prevented them from resolving these shallow \nregions.  For example shelf wide models of the European continental shelf used a grid \nresolution of 1\/12\u00b0 and hence could not resolve coastal regions where \u201cwetting and drying\u201d \noccurred and higher harmonics were generated by non-linear effects.  To examine the \nnearshore generation of higher harmonics, higher resolution limited area finite difference \nmodels were developed, for example the 1 km grid model of the eastern Irish Sea used by \nJones and Davies (1996) (hereafter JD96).  The difficulty of using such limited area models \nto examine the influence of \u201cwetting and drying\u201d in nearshore regions upon the higher \nharmonics was that because of the limited extent of the model these harmonics were \nsignificant at the open boundary of the model.  Hence these harmonics had to be included as \nopen boundary forcing to the model and consequently their distribution over the region was \nnot only influenced by nearshore dynamics but also by open boundary forcing.  Consequently \nthe effect of nearshore dynamics could not be examined in detail. \n An alternative to using a uniform finite difference grid is to apply an unstructured \nfinite element approach (see Jones (2002), Walters (2005), Greenberg et al (2007) for reviews \nof the method).  This method was used in the English Channel to compare tidal solutions \ncomputed with finite difference and finite element models of the area (Werner 1995).  \nHowever, as the domain of the model was limited higher harmonics were included along the \nopen boundary.  In addition there were no appreciable \u201cwetting and drying\u201d areas in the \nregion, hence their effects upon the higher harmonics of the tide could not be investigated. \n 5 \nConsequently although a rigorous model-model and model-data comparison could be \nperformed the solution for the higher harmonics was in part influenced by their distribution \nalong the open boundary.  In addition because the model domain had a limited geographic \nextent the M2 solution was also in part constrained by the open boundary.  In this paper by \nusing a larger domain model, with only M2 tidal forcing and including \u201cwetting and drying\u201d \nthese problems are to a certain extent minimized (see later).  Consequently the higher \nharmonics are generated entirely by the non-linear processes, in particular momentum \nadvection, quadratic bottom friction and the non-linear term in the continuity equation \ninvolving the product of velocity and total water depth (e.g. Davies and Kwong 2000).  For a \ndetailed discussion of the generation of higher harmonics the reader is referred to Parker \n(2007), Walters (1986, 1992).  In addition when a nearshore region \u201cwets and dries\u201d over a \ntidal cycle, the harmonic analysis of the resulting elevation time series contains significant \nhigher harmonics.  These arise due to the presence of a Gibbs type effect as drying and \nsubsequent wetting occurs.   \nIn essence this paper extends the work of Werner 1995, by examining a different sea \narea where the higher harmonics and wetting\/drying are important.  In addition the sensitivity \nof the tidal solution in the nearshore region to water depth and finite element resolution is \nexamined in detail.  Also, by using a number of finite element models and comparing \ndifferences between models and also differences between them and observations, it is \npossible to illustrate the difficulties in performing a model skill assessment exercise that can \nreveal \u201ctrue model\u201d predictive capability in an arbitrary sea region.  This problem is \ndiscussed in the final part of the paper.  These considerations complement the work of Roed \net al (1995) who showed how difficult it was to design test cases for model intercomparison. \n Recently a finite element tidal model of the west coast of Britain has been developed \n(Jones and Davies, 2005, hereafter JD05) based upon the application of the TELEMAC code \n 6 \nto solve the finite element equations that describe tidal motion in the region.  The TELEMAC \ncode has been used very successfully in other shallow water regions (e.g. Malcherek 2000, \nHeniche et al 2000, Hervouet 2002, Fernandes et al 2002, 2004) and preliminary calculations \n(JD05) showed that it could reproduce the major features of the tide off the west coast of \nBritain without any tuning and using boundary forcing and topography taken from a previous \nuniform finite difference model.  The finite element grid of this model is ideal for examining \nthe effects of nearshore dynamics upon higher harmonics of the tide (Jones and Davies \n2007a) for a number of reasons.  The most important of these is that the model\u2019s open \nboundary is well removed from the shallow water region, namely the eastern Irish Sea where \n\u201cwetting and drying\u201d occurs and higher harmonics are generated.  Consequently, the model is \nonly forced by the M2 tide and the higher harmonics are generated solely within the region.  \nIn addition the model has high resolution (Fig. 1) in the shallow eastern Irish Sea (Fig. 2a,b) \nwhere higher harmonics are important.  Also, there is a comprehensive tidal data set, \nincluding the higher harmonics for model validation and an accurate solution from a limited \narea high resolution (1 km) finite difference model of the region, for comparison purposes. \n The objective of this paper is to examine to what extent a range of finite element \ncodes, namely TELEMAC (Hervouet 2002), ADCIRC (e.g. Hench and Luettich 2003, \nLuettich and Westerink 1995) and QUODDY (e.g. Naimie et al 2001) can calculate the \nhigher harmonics of the M2 tide in the eastern Irish Sea, and the sensitivity of the solution to \nchanges in nearshore water depth.  In addition small scale variations of the tide in the near \ncoastal region are used to examine the sensitivity of the solution to grid resolution.  Although \ntidal calculations are only performed with the M2 tidal forcing and other calculations (e.g. the \nthree dimensional models of Jones and Davies (1996), Lynch et al (2003,2004)) included \nmore constituents which can influence the tide (see later discussion) the model \nintercomparisons are very revealing. In addition as shown by Aldridge and Davies (1993) \n 7 \nthere is significant spatial variability in bed types and bed forms over the eastern Irish Sea, \nwhich besides the presence of other tidal constituents appreciably influences tidal damping in \nthe region.  These uncertainties and the fact that the main emphasis of the paper is to compare \nthe various model solutions justifies the use of the M2 tidal forcing only. In order to compare \nmodels, in all calculations the same water depth distribution and bottom friction coefficient \nwas used.  As shown by Nicolle and Karpytchev (2007) there is a good case for a spatially \nvariable friction close to the coast. However to perform \u201clike with like\u201d comparisons a \nconstant value was used here.  This is consistent with earlier finite difference calculations.  In \naddition open boundary tidal forcing was the same in all calculations and taken from that \nused by DJ92. The open boundary conditions used in DJ92 were based on limited offshore \nobservations in the region and tidal solution from larger domain models (Kwong et al 1997). \nAlthough there may have been some inaccuracy in this boundary forcing they were shown to \ngive an accurate tidal solution in the region when used to force a finite difference model.  An \nalternative used by Lynch et al (2003) is to use assimilation into a model to derive off shore \nboundary conditions. However, problems in accuracy of tidal data, particularly that of off \nshore data (see later) and any numerical bias in the assimilation model may lead to a bias in \nthis open boundary forcing. In essence in order to derive a truly unbiased accurate offshore \nset of tidal data requires precise off shore tidal measurement at locations which have a major \ninfluence upon the computed tidal solution.  An example of how to use a model to determine \nthe critical tidal measurements that are required in offshore regions is given in Davies (1976).  \nHowever, in the case of the present model, this would prove to be an expensive measurement \nexercise.  Hence in all calculations, tidal forcing was identical to that used in DJ92.   \nConsequently models were not tuned to give an accurate tidal solution, by adjusting open \nboundary input, friction or depths, and hence differences in model solution reflected model \ndynamics. \n 8 \n The fact that all the finite element models were run with the same topography, M2 \ntidal open boundary forcing and same bottom friction, taken from an earlier finite difference \nmodel of the region, ensures that the forcing and dissipation had not been adjusted to \noptimize the solution for a particular finite element code.  Consequently there was no \u201cbuilt \nin\u201d bias to favour one particular finite element model.  In addition the model-model and \nmodel-data intercomparisons are a \u201ctrue\u201d test of the variability in solutions of each of the \nfinite element models, rather than the usual approach where a model is \u201ctuned\u201d to give the \n\u201cbest fit\u201d to a set of observations. \n As will be shown later by not \u201ctuning\u201d the models it is possible to determine the true \nvariability in solutions computed with a range of finite element models.  In addition model \nbias to under\/over predict a particular constituent can be assessed.  By including or omitting \nnear coastal shallow water regions the extent to which these influence the higher harmonics \nand hence the degree to which accurate nearshore topography has to be measured and must \nbe resolved can be assessed.  In addition the intercomparison exercise illustrates the major \nproblems in doing model-model and model-data intercomparisons, and the enormous \ndifficulties of doing a \u201crigorous model skill\u201d assessment exercise. \n The form of the hydrodynamic equations solved with these various finite element \ncodes is presented in the next section.  Solutions from the various codes are given in \nsubsequent sections together with details of their sensitivity to water depth variation, and \ntheir variability in nearshore regions.  Major conclusions from the study are presented in the \nlast section of the paper, where the difficulties in doing a \u201ctrue model skill assessment\u201d are \ndiscussed. \n2. HYDRODYNAMIC EQUATIONS \n Since the focus of the study is tidal elevation, then it is sufficient to solve the two \ndimensional vertically integrated hydrodynamic equations, details of which are given in DJ92 \n 9 \nand JD96 and will not be repeated here.  As the west coast of Britain model spans a range of \nlatitudes (Fig. 1a,b) then spherical coordinates were used, although the region was not \nsufficiently large to require the addition of tidal potential forcing.  Since these equations \ncontain all the non-linear terms necessary to generate the higher harmonics of the tide, then in \nprinciple given accurate topography and an appropriate form of bottom friction, together with \naccurate tidal forcing, they should be able to reproduce the higher tidal harmonics.   \n The same water depth distribution, finite element grid (Fig. 2) and M2 tidal open \nboundary forcing taken from the finite difference model described in DJ92 which yielded an \naccurate M2 tidal distribution in the region, were used in the TELEMAC, ADCIRC and \nQUODDY calculations.  Consequently differences in solution arise from differences in the \nvarious codes.  Solutions were generated from initial conditions of zero elevation and motion \nat t = 0, by integrating forward in time over seven tidal cycles and harmonically analysing the \nfinal cycle for the M2, M4 and M6 constituents.  Preliminary calculations showed that because \nof significant frictional dissipation in the region a sinusoidal solution, that was independent of \nthe initial conditions was established within six tidal cycles.  For this reason the seventh tidal \ncycle was harmonically analysed and used in the comparisons.  At closed boundaries the \nnormal component of velocity was zero.  In addition the horizontal gradient normal to the \ncoast of alongshore velocity was set to zero, giving a perfect lateral slip condition.   \n3. NUMERICAL SOLUTION \n3.1 Grid Generation \n The underlying water depths describing the domain and open boundary tidal \ndescription originate from the finite difference models of DJ92 and JD96 and were used to \ngenerate the finite element grid of JD05 allowing a like with like comparison with these \nearlier models. Previous calculations with JD05 showed that an optimal M2 tidal solution in \nthe region was obtained using a mesh refinement based on water depth such that the ratio \n 10 \nbetween element size and (gh)\u00bd was constant, with g acceleration due to gravity and h water \ndepth.  This approach was applied here with the identical water depths used in JD05, to give \ngrid G3AX (Fig. 2).  In this grid the maximum size of element had a side length of order 5 \nkm and occurred in deep water, with nearshore elements of order 0.5 km.  As the model water \ndepths included nearshore values that were above mean sea level, \u201cwetting and drying\u201d \noccurred during the tidal cycle.  To examine to what extent the tidal solution, in particular the \nhigher harmonics was influenced by this, a second mesh was generated (G3AX5M) in which \nall water depths shallower than 5m were replaced by a 5 m minimum water depth.  This \nrevised set of water depths was then used to generate a new grid G3AX5M using the identical \ncriteria, namely (gh)1\/2, as that for grid G3AX.  Consequently in deep water nodal locations \nwere the same, but in shallow water the two meshes were slightly different.  Calculations \n(Table 1) were performed using all the codes on both meshes, except for the version of \nQUODDY used here which did not allow for \u201cwetting and drying\u201d and was therefore only \nrun on grid G3AX5M.  By this means the influence of including accurate nearshore water \ndepths and the associated \u201cwetting and drying\u201d upon the accuracy of the tide could be \ndetermined.  We have recently learned from a reviewer that a version of QUODDY now \nexists (Greenberg et al 2005) that allows for \u201cwetting and drying\u201d.  However as the main aim \nhere is to show to what extent \u201cwetting and drying\u201d influences a solution this can be \nillustrated with the TELEMAC and ADCIRC results. \n Although a number of techniques exist in the literature to generate an optimal mesh \nfor a given problem and area (e.g. Hagen et al 2001, 2002, Legrand et al 2006, 2007 and the \nreview of Greenberg et al 2007) these methods were not used here, where the main aim was \nto compare a number of finite element solutions using the same mesh \n3.2 TELEMAC \n3.2.1 Calculations including detailed nearshore topography, Grid G3AX (Calc 1) \n 11 \n In an initial calculation (Calc 1, Table 1) tides were computed using the TELEMAC \ncode and grid G3AX.  Since detailed results and discussions of the co-tidal charts are given \nelsewhere (JD05) only the main points are presented here.  Comparisons with observations at \ncoastal and offshore tide gauges in the eastern Irish Sea (see Fig. 3, and JD05 for exact \nlocations) for the M2, M4 and M6 tidal elevation amplitude and phase are given in Tables 2a,b \nand c. \n The computed M2 cotidal chart (Fig. 4a(i)) is characterized by a rapid increase in \namplitude in shallow water regions such as the Bristol Channel and eastern Irish Sea.  It is \nimportant to note that for clarity of contour annotation these co-tidal charts are derived by \ngridding the detailed output from the finite element model. Consequently there is some loss \nof resolution in the near shore region. Within the North Channel of the Irish Sea the model \nreproduces the tidal distribution found in limited area high resolution models of the region \n(Davies et al 2001) and derived from measurements (George 1980).  In addition the \namphidromic point in the western Irish Sea, and the overall distribution of the tidal amplitude \nand phase in the Irish Sea is in good agreement with cotidal charts based on observations \n(Robinson 1979).  A detailed point by point comparison with measurements at coastal and \noffshore gauges in the Eastern Irish Sea (Table 2a) shows that on average there is good \nagreement although at some locations tidal amplitude is slightly over-estimated by about 10 \ncm, with phase of order 5\u00b0 too high.  As the accuracy of the instrument and length of the \nrecord used to derive this harmonic analysis varies from location to location, with typically a \n2 month record from an offshore tide gauge and 12 months from a coastal gauge then \nproviding error bars on the observational data is very difficult.  This is a major consideration \nin any skill assessment exercise.  However as the main aim of the paper is a model-model \nintercomparison, then the changes in solution given in the various tables are a true measure of \ninter-model variability. \n 12 \n At a number of shallow water coastal gauges for example Hilbre (location E), Barrow \n(where there are three gauges at locations Y, Z and AA, in close proximity to each other, see \nFig. 3), Morecambe (BB) and Fleetwood (CC), there appears to be some difference between \nobserved and computed values, despite the fact that the finite element mesh has high \nresolution in these regions of order 50m.  To understand this, values at nearby nodal positions \na distance \u2206 from the observational point were examined (Table 3a). \n It is apparent that at Hilbre at the nearest nodal point (\u2206 = 1.1 km, h = 9.6 m), hc = \n307 cm, gc = 310\u00b0 (compared with ho = 292, go = 317\u00b0) that is 15 cm too high and 7\u00b0 too low.  \nAt an equivalent (\u2206 = 1.1 km) point in shallower water h = 2 m, hc = 269 cm, gc = 308\u00b0, \nnamely 39 cm too low, and 9\u00b0 too low.  This suggests that despite the high resolution mesh in \nthe region, there is significant spatial variability in the tide from one mesh point to the next.  \nAt nodes slightly farther away, namely \u2206 = 1.3 and 1.8 km, water depths are 16.2 m and 2.3 \nm, with the higher tidal amplitude occurring in the deeper water (Table 3a) where frictional \neffects are less.  Despite the change in amplitude, the phase changes very little from one point \nto the next, suggesting that at this location the mesh is sufficiently fine to resolve tidal phase \nif not tidal amplitude. \n At Barrow RI (location Y), at the two closest nodes the water depth is zero compared \nto mean sea level and significant \u201cwetting and drying\u201d occurs.  This leads to an appreciable \nreduction in M2 tidal amplitude compared to the observed.  At other nearby locations where \nthe water depth is non-zero both amplitude and phase are in good agreement with \nobservations.  This suggests that the water depth at the two nearest points in the model may \nbe incorrect, or there is a local deeper water channel that is not resolved in the model.  At \nBarrow HP (location Z), again at the point where the water depth is zero, the M2 tidal \namplitude is under-predicted, with amplitude being slightly over-predicted and phase under-\npredicted at the other locations, suggesting slight errors in local water depth. \n 13 \n At Barrow HS (location AA), at the three nearest points the water depth is non zero \nwith the model tending to slightly over-predict amplitude and under-predict phase, although \nthere is little variation from one nodal point to another.  However, at Morecambe there is \nappreciable spatial variability in tidal amplitude over the three nearest nodes, although water \ndepth changes by less than 1 m between them.  This suggests that the mesh is insufficiently \nfine to resolve the tidal variability in the region.  As at other locations, in very shallow water \nh = 0.9 m, the tidal amplitude is significantly reduced. \n Spatial variability at Fleetwood is comparable to that found at Morecambe, suggesting \nthat the mesh is not sufficiently fine and water depths are not available with sufficient \naccuracy to obtain a smooth convergent solution in these near coastal regions.  In essence the \nM2 tidal variation in these nearshore regions is comparable to the mesh resolution of the \nmodel.  Obviously the model mesh could be continuously refined in the near shore region \nuntil a convergent solution was obtained.  However, without precise knowledge of water \ndepths in the coastal area, which can change between storm events, and accurate knowledge \nof bed types and bedforms which influence frictional dissipation in the region (Aldridge and \nDavies 1993) it is unlikely that continuous mesh refinement will guarantee increased model \naccuracy.  As the main aim here is a model intercomparison on a fixed mesh, then an \nindication of solution variability for that mesh in the near shore is all that is required.  \nObviously, in a skill assessment exercise of a model\u2019s true predictive capability this will be \nlimited by our knowledge of near shore conditions. \n The computed M4 cotidal chart (Fig. 4b) shows the M4 tidal amplitude, which was \nzero on the model\u2019s open boundary, increasing over the Celtic Sea to a maximum of 10 cm in \nthe southern part of the Irish Sea.  The computed M4 amplitude decreases from this maximum \nto a minimum to the west of the Isle of Man (Fig. 4b).  This spatial variability is found in \nobservations and shelf wide finite difference numerical models (Davies and Kwong 2000).  In \n 14 \nthe shallow eastern Irish Sea the M4 amplitude increases rapidly as the shallow coastal region \nis approached (Fig. 4b).  On average the M4 tide in the eastern Irish Sea is computed with a \ncomparable accuracy to the higher resolution (1 km grid) limited area (eastern Irish Sea only) \nfinite difference model of JD96.  This level of agreement suggests that the TELEMAC model \nis correctly reproducing the physical aspects of the processes generating the M4 tide.  In JD96 \nalthough the finite difference model yielded an accurate solution this was in fact in part due \nto the specification of the M4 tide along the open boundary of that limited area model. \n Although in general the M4 tide is adequately reproduced, it is evident that at certain \ncoastal locations there are some significant errors (Table 2b).  Considering the near coastal \nlocations used previously for the M2 tide, it is evident that at Hilbre the M4 tidal amplitude \nvaries by only 4 cm over the four nearest nodes, although there is a significant variation in \nphase from 158\u00b0 to 228\u00b0 (Table 3b).  This is in marked contrast to the M2 tide where the \nphase was essentially uniform but the amplitude varied (Table 3a). \n At Barrow RI in regions where the water depth was zero, and \u201cwetting and drying\u201d \noccurred the amplitude was significantly larger than found in the observations (Table 3b).  At \nthese locations the M2 tidal elevation was decreased below the observed (Table 3a) due to \nexcessive energy going into the M4 tide.  At the two locations close to Barrow RI where \n\u201cwetting and drying\u201d did not occur, M4 tidal amplitude agreed well with the observed, Table \n3b, although the phase was under-estimated.  Similarly at Barrow HP, at the location of zero \nwater depth, tidal amplitude was over-estimated (Table 3b).  At other sites close to Barrow \nHP computed and observed amplitude and phase were in good agreement, with phase \nshowing only a small spatial variation.  This suggests that at this site the M4 is well resolved \non the mesh. \n At Barrow HS computed amplitude and phase show only small scale variability, with \namplitude showing good agreement with observed, although the phase was under-estimated \n 15 \n(Table 3b).  Significant spatial variability exists in the computed M4 tide at Morecambe \nwhich is related to the variability found in the M2 tide (Table 2b).  At Fleetwood, at the \nshallow water nodes, the amplitude of the M4 tide is again over-estimated (Table 3b) with a \ncorresponding decrease in the M2 tide (Table 3a) due to \u201cwetting and drying\u201d transferring \nenergy into the higher harmonics.  As discussed previously this suggests inaccurate water \ndepths or a deep channel not resolved by the model.  At the node 2.3 km from the tide gauge, \nM4 amplitude is in reasonable agreement with observations, although the phase is under-\npredicted.  These detailed M4 comparisons in shallow water explain why the M2 tide at some \nnodes is significantly below the observed, with an associated over-estimate of the M4 tide. \n The computed M6 cotidal chart (Fig. 4c) shows a rapid increase in tidal amplitude in \nshallow water due to an increase in bottom friction.  In the Liverpool Bay region there is a \ngradual increase as the water shallows, with a more rapid increase as the Cumbrian coast is \napproached.  The spatial changes in M6 are due to local decreases in water depth, with a rapid \nincrease in regions where \u201cwetting and drying\u201d occurs (see later).  Similar spatial variability \nwith changes in water depth are found in the observed M6 tide. \n Comparisons at various ports (Table 2c) shows that at a number of locations the \nmodel significantly overpredicts tidal amplitude.  The reason for this can be understood by \nexamining the spatial variability of the tide in the region of the observational point (Table \n3c).  Considering initially Hilbre, it is evident that at \u2206 = 1.1 km in very shallow water h = 2 \nm, hc = 21 cm compared with ho = 2 cm.  However, slightly farther away \u2206 = 1.3 km, and h = \n16.2m, or nearer \u2206 = 1.1 km, h = 9.6 m, hc is reduced to 7 or 8 cm.  As for the M4 tide, the M6 \ntide shows significant spatial variability over short distances. \n At Barrow RI in regions that \u201cwet and dry\u201d, namely h = 0 m, the amplitude, although \nnot the phase, is in reasonable agreement with observation.  However at nearby deeper water \nnodes there are significant errors in both amplitude and phase.  Similarly at Barrow HP at \n 16 \nnodes in deeper water locations the tidal amplitude is larger than at nodes in the shallow \nwater, with a significant difference in phase error.  At Barrow HS, all adjacent nodes are in \ndeeper water, and have comparable values, of order 6 cm, which although higher is in \nreasonable agreement with the observed 3 cm, although the phase is about 35\u00b0 too low, \nsuggesting a local change that is not resolved in the model.  Although there are large phase \nchanges of order 35\u00b0 in M6, the fact that a phase change of 87\u00b0 represents only a one hour \ntime shift for this constituent, does put these errors into perspective compared with the M2 \ntide. \n Comparable M6 tidal amplitudes are found at all nodes at Morecambe, although there \nis significant spatial variability in the phase.  In addition tidal amplitude is over-estimated.  \nThis suggests that there are local changes that are not resolved in the model.  Similar spatial \nvariability is found at Fleetwood, again suggesting a lack of resolution. \n From the M4 and M6 cotidal charts (Fig. 4b(i), 4c(i)) it is evident that their amplitude \nand phase change very rapidly in shallow water, particularly in the eastern Irish Sea in \nregions such as the Solway estuary and Morecambe Bay.  A detailed examination of the tidal \ndistribution in these regions (Fig. 4b(ii), 4c(ii)) clearly shows that more detailed coastal \nresolution is required, with an associated enhanced refinement of the mesh.  As discussed \npreviously the contours shown here were derived by gridding finite element output and do not \nreflect the high resolution of the finite element grid (Fig. 2) in the near shore region. For the \nM2 tide the present resolution appears adequate, although the extent to which it and the \nshallow water constituents are influenced away from the coastline by details of nearshore \ntopography and the presence of \u201cwetting and drying\u201d is not clear.  This problem is examined \nin the next section. \n3.2.2. Calculation involving under-resolved nearshore topography Grid G3AX5M (Calc 2) \n 17 \n To examine to what extent the solution away from the nearshore region is influenced \nby near coastal water depths that are normally not resolved in coarse grid models, or not \navailable with sufficient spatial coverage or accuracy, the previous calculation was repeated \nwith a minimum water depth of 5 m.  This also meant that \u201cwetting and drying\u201d did not take \nplace and hence its influence on the solution was removed.  Although changing the water \ndepth distribution produced a slightly different grid in the near shore region (namely grid \nG3AX5M, Table 1), since this is related to (gh)\u00bd (see earlier discussion), away from the \ncoastline the nodal distribution was as previously. \n Comparison of the model wide computed  cotidal chart (not shown) (derived with this \nmodified grid (Calc 1M, Table 1)) with that derived previously (Fig. 4a(i)(ii)) did not reveal \nany significant differences outside the Irish Sea region.  However, within the Irish Sea, in \nparticular the eastern Irish Sea away from the nearshore region there was on average an \nincrease in tidal amplitude (compare Figs. 4a(ii) and 5a(ii)) due to the removal of shallow \nwater coastal regions where significant energy dissipation occurred (Davies and Kwong \n2000) and energy was transferred to higher harmonics.  It is evident from a comparison of \nFigs. 4a(ii) and 5a(ii) that in the nearshore region of the eastern Irish Sea the effect of setting \nthe minimum water depth to 5 m is to remove the small scale variability in the M2 tidal \namplitude found with realistic water depths.  This gives rise to a much smoother variation in \nthe co-amplitude lines comparable to those found in coarse grid models (Davies and Kwong \n2000). \n Comparing computed values in Table 2a (Calc 1 and Calc 1M) it is evident that at \noffshore gauges S, T, U (Fig. 3) the removal of shallow water in near coastal regions leads to \na decrease in M2 tidal amplitude of the order of about 5 cm, although no significant change in \nphase.  A larger decrease of order 8 cm occurs at coastal gauges in the Liverpool Bay region \n(e.g. gauges B, F) with little phase change.  In very shallow regions (e.g. Morecambe BB) \n 18 \namplitude increases by about 20 cm, although as discussed previously in the case of the \nG3AX grid, this depends upon the location of the nodal point. \n To determine to what extent spatial variability in shallow regions is influenced by grid \nand water depth change, the same locations used previously were considered (Table 3a).  \nSince the mesh distribution has changed, then both \u2206 and h are different from those given \npreviously (Table 3a), although again nearest locations are used.  Considering initially Hilbre \n(Table 4a, Calc 1M) it is evident that at this location, although water depth changes \nsignificantly from one node to another, the effect of imposing a minimum depth of 5 m is that \nthere is only a small variation in tidal amplitude and phase from one node to another, \ncompared to previously where realistic water depths were applied.  This shows that with a \nminimum depth of 5 m the mesh is adequate to resolve the computed M2 tide.  A similar \nresult is found at Barrow RI and HP, although at Barrow HS there is some small scale \nvariability.  As illustrated in Tables 3a and 4a, setting a minimum depth of 5 m significantly \nincreases tidal amplitude (Table 4a) above that found previously using realistic depths at \nlocations where these were below 5 m.  At Morecambe and Fleetwood, water depths at \nnearby nodes (Table 3a) were appreciably less than 5 m, and hence the effect of specifying a \n5 m minimum is to produce a region of constant water depth (Table 4a) and increased tidal \namplitude.  Despite the water depths at Morecambe having h = 5 m, the tidal amplitude varies \nby 4 cm, and phase by 4\u00b0 over relatively short distances suggesting that a further mesh \nrefinement is required despite the constant water depth in the region.  In addition when more \nrealistic water depths are used, the spatial variability increases, with a significant reduction \ncompared to observations in very shallow water.  This suggests that as the grid is refined \nmore detailed accurate nearshore topography that can resolve deeper channels is also \nrequired. \n 19 \n Considering the M4 component of the tide, as for the M2 tide outside the Irish Sea (not \nshown) there is not a significant difference between the M4 tide computed using mesh G3AX \nand G3AX5M.  However in the eastern Irish Sea (compare Figs. 4b(ii) and 5b) the M4 tidal \namplitude is significantly reduced when a minimum h = 5 m is used.  This average reduction \nin M4 tidal amplitude is evident from a comparison at gauges in the eastern Irish Sea \n(compare Calcs 1 and 1M in Table 2b).  At offshore gauges in deeper water (locations S, T, \nU) it is evident from Table 2b that amplitude has reduced by 4 cm on average, with phase \nincreasing by 10\u00b0 to 15\u00b0.  In Liverpool Bay, at gauges I, Q, R, the amplitude change is small, \nof order 1 cm, with phase change of 15\u00b0.  However further north at offshore gauge V the \namplitude is reduced by 6 cm, with phase increasing by over 30\u00b0.  Similarly at coastal gauges \nin this region namely H and K (Fig. 2b) the amplitude is reduced from 12 cm (Calc 1) to 6 cm \n(Calc 1M) (cf, observed 12 cm at H), and 13 cm (Calc 1) to 7 cm (Calc 1M) (cf, observed 13 \ncm) at K.  This confirms what is shown in Figs. 4b(ii) and 5b, that although the M4 tide is \naffected over the whole eastern Irish Sea, the largest difference is in the northern part of the \nregion.  Although amplitude is reduced on average it is evident from Table 2b, that at some \nlocations (e.g. Heysham, Hilbre, Barrow HP) it has increased.  To examine this it is necessary \nto consider the small scale variability close to the tide gauge (Table 4b).  As for the M2 tide \nthe effect of using a minimum water depth of 5m, is to remove a significant amount of the \nspatial variability (Table 4b) of the M4 tide in the region of the tide gauge (see Hilbre, Barrow \nRI, Barrow HP and Fleetwood in Table 4b) compared to previously (Table 3b).  This tends to \nlead to a reduction at nodes where previously \u201cwetting and drying\u201d occurred and an increase \nelsewhere.  However, at locations such as Barrow HS more spatial variability is introduced, \nwith an associated increase in M4, reducing the agreement of the nearest node average and the \nobservation.  Similarly at Morecambe the use of a minimum water depth of 5 m leads to a \nsignificant increase in M4 amplitude.  This suggests that, as for M2, as water depth spatial \n 20 \nvariability is reduced, so the mesh resolution can be coarser, although the error in the \ncomputed tide is enhanced giving rise to inaccuracies in the model. \n For the M6 tide the distribution of co-amplitude and co-phase lines outside the Irish \nSea (not shown) computed with mesh G3AX5M (Calc 1M) is comparable to that given in \nFig. 4c(i).  However, within the eastern Irish Sea particularly in the northern and nearshore \nregion there are appreciable differences (compare Figs. 4c(ii) and 5c).  In particular in the \ncalculation with a minimum water depth of 5 m the spatial variability is smoother, and there \nis not a rapid increase close to the coast. \n Comparisons at both offshore and coastal gauges in the eastern Irish Sea (Table2c, \nCalc 1 and Calc 1M) show that at offshore gauges (e.g. locations Q to U) there is little change \nin amplitude although phase changes by a few degrees.  This is to be expected since the M6 \ntide is generated by local bottom friction and influenced locally by \u201cwetting and drying\u201d.  \nSince these effects at offshore locations are not appreciably changed between meshes G3AX \nand G3AX5M, then this is to be expected.  However, in nearshore regions there are \nsignificant differences in the solutions. \n From calculations 1 and 1M in Tables 3c and 4c, as for M2 and M4, specifying a \nminimum water depth, at all locations appreciably reduces the spatial variability in the \nsolution.  However, at Morecambe the amplitude still changes significantly over relatively \nshort distances, suggesting that a finer mesh is required.  In addition the M6 amplitude is \nappreciably larger than the measured value.  This suggests that the large value found in both \nsolutions is not due to \u201cwetting and drying\u201d or the effect of harmonically analysing a \ndiscontinuous time series, but arises from non-linear effects in particular bottom friction \nwhich may be incorrectly formulated in these shallow regions. \n3.3 ADCIRC \n3.3.1 Calculations including detailed nearshore topography, Grid G3AX (Calc 3) \n 21 \nIn order to quantify (Tables 2a-c) and examine the spatial variability of the \ndifferences between the tides computed using TELEMAC and ADCIRC, differences in \namplitude and phase between the M2, M4 and M6 constituents computed with TELEMAC and \nADCIRC are given in Figs. 6a-c.  Since both models are forced with identical open boundary \ninput, then it is evident that in the region of the open boundary, the two solutions are the \nsame.  However, the location of the amphidromic point off the south-east corner of Ireland is \nslightly further north in the calculation with ADCIRC compared to the TELEMAC \ncalculation.  This gives rise to a positive difference in the region to the north of the \namphidrome and negative to the south, as shown in the difference plot (Fig. 6a).  In addition \nthere are phase differences in the region of the amphidromic point.  Similarly in the region of \nthe North Channel there are differences in the tidal distribution computed with each of the \nmodels, as shown in the distribution of differences (Fig. 6a).  The differences in the two \nsolutions increase within the Irish Sea, particularly in the eastern Irish Sea, where the tidal \namplitude computed with ADCIRC is of the order of 30 cm below that computed with \nTELEMAC, with phase 8\u00ba higher (Fig. 6a).  These differences are clearly evident (compare \nCalcs 1 and 2, Table 2a) at the coastal gauges given in Table 2a, with ADCIRC having a \ntendency to underpredict the tide in shallow regions, although TELEMAC gave good \nagreement.  In terms of M2 phases, it is evident from Table 2a and Fig. 6a, that ADCIRC \ncomputed phases of order 8\u00ba higher than TELEMAC.  This gave rise to slightly better \nagreement with the observed phase than that found with TELEMAC.  The reason for this \ndifference in amplitude and phase in the eastern Irish Sea is that at offshore gauges V, U, S, T \nin the eastern Irish Sea (see Fig. 3b for gauge locations) the M2 tidal amplitude derived from \nTELEMAC (Calc 1, Table 2a) was significantly (of order 10 cm) higher than the observed \nwhereas for ADCIRC it was about 20 cm lower.  In addition the phase is of the order of 8\u00ba \nhigher at these offshore gauges.  This suggests that it is not just differences in numerical \n 22 \ndamping in the nearshore region between the two models that produce differences in the \nagreement at coastal gauges, but also the M2 tidal propagation over the whole domain.  The \nfact that the M2 tidal solution from TELEMAC is in better agreement at eastern Irish Sea \ncoastal gauges than ADCIRC (compare Calcs 1 and 2 in Table 2a) is in part due to the fact \nthat this model tended to overpredict the tide at the offshore gauges V, U, S and T and in \nessence both models have a tendency to overdamp tidal energy in the shallow eastern Irish \nSea.  This may in part be due to the fact that no attempt was made to optimize bottom friction \nin this region or elsewhere in the model. \nIn terms of differences in the computed M4 co-tidal chart, it is evident (Fig. 6b) that \nthese are small outside the eastern Irish Sea.  This is to be expected since Fig. 4b(i) shows \nthat the M4 tide is largest in the eastern Irish Sea.  In the southern half of the eastern Irish Sea \nit is apparent (Fig. 6b) that the M4 tidal amplitude computed with TELEMAC is larger than \nthat determined with ADCIRC, whereas in the north of the region the M4 amplitude from \nADCIRC is slightly larger.  In addition, away from the very near coastal region in the \nnorthern half of the eastern Irish Sea, ADCIRC computes phase of order 10\u00ba higher than \nTELEMAC.  However, in the southern half of the eastern Irish Sea the phase difference \nbetween the two solutions is small (Fig. 6b).  These differences are apparent at offshore \ngauges T and V (Table 2b).  This may also be seen at northern coastal gauges e.g. H and K, \nwhere M4 amplitude from ADCIRC exceeds that from TELEMAC, whereas at southern \ngauges e.g. E and O, TELEMAC M4 amplitudes exceed those from ADCIRC (see Table 2b, \nCalcs 1 and 2).  Also, phases from TELEMAC exceed those from ADCIRC.  In view of the \nfact that TELEMAC gives a larger M2 tide in the eastern Irish Sea than ADCIRC, and M4 is \nmainly produced by M2 interacting with itself, suggests that M4 computed with TELEMAC \n(Calc 1) should exceed that computed with ADCIRC (Calc 2).  This is found on average over \nthe whole Irish Sea, but does not explain the difference between the northern and southern \n 23 \nregions of the eastern Irish Sea.  One possibility why this difference occurs in M4, is that M2 \ninteracts with M4, to give M6, takes some energy from the M4 tide.  Although the amplitude \nof the M6 tide, even in shallow water is small compared with the M2 tide (typically of order \n10 cm compared with 2 m) and consequently it is not important in terms of total tidal \nelevation, it is a valuable indicator of a model\u2019s accuracy in shallow water.  To examine to \nwhat extent M2 and M4 interaction produce M6 in the eastern Irish Sea it is useful to consider \nthe distribution of the M6 tide in the eastern Irish Sea.  However, contours of the difference in \nthe M6 tidal amplitude computed with TELEMAC and ADCIRC (not shown) did not show \nsubstantial differences except in the nearshore region, due to the small (of order 1 cm in the \nnorth eastern Irish Sea and 5 cm in the south eastern Irish Sea, see Fig. 4c) amplitude of the \nM6 tide.  Comparison of M6 tidal amplitudes (Calcs 1 and 2) at coastal gauges where there \nwas an appreciable signal (Table 2c) showed that there was a bias for the M6 computed from \nTELEMAC to exceed that from ADCIRC.  This probably arises because the M2 tide in \nshallow water computed with TELEMAC exceeds that derived with ADCIRC.  However, this \ndoes not explain the differences in the M4 distribution.  The above analysis of M2 interacting \nwith itself to give M4, and subsequent M2 and M4 interaction to give M6 is based upon an \nenergy cascade from lower to higher frequencies.  In practice just as M2 interacts with itself \nto give a tidal residual, M2 can interact with M4 and M6 to transfer energy to lower \nfrequencies (see Walters 1986, 1992) although the amplitude of the lower frequencies \ngenerated by this process will be small. \nIn terms of M6 phases, it is evident from Table 2c that there is significant spatial \nvariability in both computed and observed phases in coastal regions.  Also, there does not \nappear to be a consistent difference between M6 phases computed with TELEMAC and \nADCIRC in these regions. \n 24 \nAs was found in the M2 tidal solution computed with TELEMAC there is significant \nspatial variability in the M2 tidal amplitude computed with ADCIRC in the region \nsurrounding a coastal gauge (see Calc, 2 Table 3a). \nIn essence the high spatial variability found in the TELEMAC calculation of the M2 \namplitude (Calc 1, Table 3a) at nodal points adjacent to shallow water ports is also found in \nADCIRC (Calc 2, Table 3a).  Also, as found on average throughout the model domain, the \namplitude computed with ADCIRC (Calc 2) is below that found in TELEMAC (Calc 1).  In \naddition phases computed with ADCIRC are very slightly (of order 3\u00ba on average, Table 3a) \nlarger than those computed with TELEMAC.  However, both models give consistent phases \nand show that the phase does not change appreciably at nodal points near the gauges. \nFor the M4 component of the tide, the ADCIRC calculation shows comparable spatial \nvariability in tidal amplitude with nodal location (Calc 2, Table 3b) to that found with \nTELEMAC (Calc 1, Table 3b).  However, as discussed previously in terms of the eastern \nIrish Sea M4 tidal distribution, the M4 amplitude computed with ADCIRC, is less than that \ndue to TELEMAC (compare Calcs 1 and 2 in Table 3b).  As suggested previously because \nM4 is generated by the non-linear interaction of M2 with itself, then a reduction in M2 \namplitude will reduce the M4 amplitude.  The significant spatial variability found in the M4 \nphase computed with TELEMAC also occurs with ADCIRC.  Although ADCIRC on average \ngives a larger phase than TELEMAC, at some nodal locations the phase is below that \ncomputed with TELEMAC (compare Calcs 1 and 2 in Table 3b).  This suggests that there is \nsignificant small scale variability in the solutions computed with these models. \nThis small scale variability is also found in the M6 tidal amplitude computed with \nADCIRC (Calc 2, Table 3c).  For the M6 component at most locations there are significant \ndifferences between Calcs 1 and 2, and these differences vary appreciably from one point to \nanother.  However, at some locations, namely Barrow HS and Morecambe both models give \n 25 \ncomparable amplitudes although there are appreciable phase differences from one node to \nanother, suggesting that there are differences in the model\u2019s ability to reproduce phase \nvariations for the higher harmonics in near coastal regions. \n3.3.2 Calculation involving under-resolved nearshore topography, Grid G3AX5M (Calc \n2M) \nTo examine to what extent the inclusion of complex nearshore topography contributes \nto the differences in tidal solutions computed with ADCIRC and TELEMAC, the ADCIRC \ncode was used to compute the tide using the G3AX5M grid.  This solution is then compared \nwith that using TELEMAC on the same grid (Calc 1M, Table 1).  As a detailed discussion of \nthe influence of near shore topography upon the tidal solution has been presented for the \nTELEMAC code, only brief details in terms of ADCIRC will be given here. \nContours of the difference in M2 tidal amplitude and phase between Calc 1M and Calc \n2M (Fig. 7a), outside the eastern Irish Sea, show similar distributions to those found with \ndetailed topography (Fig. 6a).  However, in the eastern Irish Sea in the near coastal region the \nsmall scale variability in these differences is reduced (compare Figs 6a and 7a). \n From Table 2a, it is clear that the reduction in M2 tidal amplitude and change in phase \nat eastern Irish Sea coastal gauges found between Calcs 1 and 2, is also found between Calcs \n1M and 2M.  On average the reduction in M2 amplitude computed with ADCIRC, using grid \nG3AX5M is comparable to that found with G3AX, namely of the order of 30 cm, with phase \nchanging by the order of 8\u00ba.  In essence this is consistent to that found between TELEMAC \nand ADCIRC using grid G3AX, suggesting that each model responds in the same way to the \nremoval of shallow water regions. \n For the M4 tide the difference outside the eastern Irish Sea between TELEMAC and \nADCIRC using grid G3AX5M (Fig. 7b) and the higher resolution grid G3AX (Fig. 7a) \nmainly occurs in the region of the M2 amphidromic point off the southwest corner of Ireland.  \n 26 \nThe change in position of this amphidromic point between the solutions influences the \ndistribution of the M2 tide along the west coast of Wales (Fig. 6a).  When the water depth in \nthis region changes between grids G3AX5M and G3AX, this influences the local generation \nof M4 in the region leading to an increased difference between M4 amplitude computed with \nTELEMAC and ADCIRC using grid G3AX5M than G3AX (compare Figs. 6b and 7b).  \nHowever, in the eastern Irish Sea the difference in M4 tidal amplitude computed with \nTELEMAC and ADCIRC is reduced (compare Figs. 6b and 7b).  However the phase \ndifference in the solutions in the north of the eastern Irish Sea increases slightly. \n A detailed comparison of M4 solutions (Table 2b) suggests that although the two \nmodels still give appreciably different M4 solutions using grid G3AX5M, they show \nconsistent differences in the solution using high resolution (G3AX grid) or smooth \ntopography (G3AX5M) in the nearshore region. \n For the M6 component of the tide the difference plot (not presented) together with \npoint by point comparison of ADCIRC solutions (Table 2c) shows that as for the TELEMAC \ncode at offshore gauges S, T, U, V changing from grid G3AX to G3AX5M does not \nappreciably influence the amplitude, but does affect the phase.  However the change in phase \ngoing from G3AX to G3AX5M is different in the two models.  A detailed analysis (not \npresented) shows appreciable differences in phase between TELEMAC and ADCIRC even \nwhen M6 is computed using grid G3AX5M where there is no small scale variation in \ntopography and \u201cwetting and drying\u201d does not occur. This suggests that for M6 the computed \nsolution derived from each model is significantly different.  This may in part be due to a lack \nof grid resolution in the nearshore region even when the smooth topography is used. \n To finalize the comparison of the TELEMAC and ADCIRC solutions using grid \nG3AX5M it is useful to look at the spatial variability at nodes surrounding various nearshore \ngauges (Table 4a).  As with the TELEMAC solution once a minimum water depth of 5 m is \n 27 \nspecified in the nearshore region of the eastern Irish Sea, the spatial variability at nodes \nsurrounding an observational point for all tidal constituents is significantly reduced (see Calc \n2M in Tables 4a-c).  However, as discussed previously there are significant differences in the \nsolutions computed with TELEMAC and ADCIRC even with this smooth idealized nearshore \ntopography. \n3.4 QUODDY \nAs shown previously, even when smoother nearshore topography (namely grid \nG3AX5M) is used in the calculations, and \u201cwetting and drying\u201d does not occur there are \nsignificant differences in tidal solutions computed with TELEMAC and ADCIRC.  Although \nQUODDY, as used here, does not include \u201cwetting and drying\u201d and hence cannot be run on \ngrid G3AX, it is still useful to examine the tidal solution on grid G3AX5M, and see how this \ncompares with other solutions. \nDifference plots between the TELEMAC and QUODDY solutions (Calcs 1M and \n3M) for the M2 tide (Fig. 8a) and point comparisons in the eastern Irish Sea (Table 2a, Calcs \n1M and 3M) show that on average the tidal amplitude computed with QUODDY exceeds that \ndetermined with TELEMAC. \nFrom Fig. 8a it is apparent that the amphidromic point off the southeast coast of \nIreland computed with QUODDY is farther north than that computed with TELEMAC.  Also \na detailed comparison of cotidal charts showed that the amphidrome computed with \nQUODDY was slightly to the east of that derived with TELEMAC.  This gives rise to tidal \namplitudes computed with QUODDY that are lower than TELEMAC in the region to the \nnorth of the amphidromic point (Fig. 8a).  A similar distribution of the difference between the \nmodels was found with ADCIRC (see Fig. 6a)  However the difference between the M2 tidal \namplitudes computed with TELEMAC and QUODDY decreases to the west of the Isle of \nMan, with QUODDY giving larger amplitudes in the eastern Irish Sea than TELEMAC (Fig. \n 28 \n8a).  This is significantly different than that found with ADCIRC , where the difference \nbetween TELEMAC and ADCIRC increased in the eastern Irish Sea (Fig. 6a).  One reason \nfor these different distributions is that the difference between TELEMAC and ADCIRC given \nin Fig. 6a, is based on mesh G3AX, but Fig. 8a uses mesh G3AX5M.  However since Fig. 6a \nis comparable to Fig. 7a, based on mesh G3AX5M, this difference appears to arise from \nusing QUODDY rather than ADCIRC, rather than differences in mesh. \n It is evident from Table 2a (comparison of Calcs 1M and 3M) that at locations on the \nwestern side of the eastern Irish Sea in deeper water e.g. locations Douglas and offshore \ngauge S that the M2 tidal amplitude and phase computed with QUODDY, exceed those \ncomputed with TELEMAC by about 5 cm and 8\u00ba (see Fig. 8a).  This difference on average \nhas a tendency to increase as the water shallows, giving on average in the coastal region a \ndifference in amplitude of 10 cm and phase of 5\u00ba to 10\u00ba (Fig. 8a).  This suggests that the M2 \ntidal solution in shallow water computed with QUODDY is slightly less damped than in \nTELEMAC. \n For the M4 component of the tide (Fig. 8b) it is evident that in some regions outside \nthe eastern Irish Sea, particularly close to the amphidromic point off the southeast coast of \nIreland there are some appreciable differences in M4 computed with TELEMAC and \nQUODDY (Fig. 8b).  The distribution of these differences and their magnitudes is quite \ndifferent from that found in the TELEMAC\/ADCIRC intercomparison (Fig. 7b) suggesting \nthat although all three models are forced with the same M2 tide, there are differences in the \nnumerical representation of the processes generating the M4 tide.  These are most likely to be \nin the numerical formulation of the non-linear momentum terms that move energy towards \nshorter waves and higher frequencies, and the implicit or explicit momentum diffusion terms \nwhich control this movement and stabilize the solution by removing energy at short waves.  \nTo fully identify these terms and their differences in the various models would require a \n 29 \nrange of calculations using the codes to solve the simple advection problem in an idealized \ndomain, possibly with and without the linearization of non linear terms.  Such an exercise is \noutside the scope of this paper. However, from a comparison of Figs. 7b and 8b it is evident \nthat although ADCIRC underestimates M4 amplitude compared with TELEMAC (Fig. 7b), in \nthe case of QUODDY the computed M4 amplitude is larger in near coastal regions than that \ncomputed with TELEMAC (Fig. 8b).  In both calculations there was a tendency for the M4 \nphase to be overpredicted in the northern part of the region, compared to TELEMAC. \n For the M4 component of the tide, Fig. 8b and Table 2b, show that on average in the \nshallow water region of the eastern Irish Sea the QUODDY code (Calc 3M) gives a slightly \nhigher amplitude of order 2 cm, than TELEMAC (Calc 1M).  As discussed previously this is \nprobably due to the slightly higher M2 tidal amplitude in the region.  However, in some very \nshallow water locations where TELEMAC computes a very large M4 amplitude e.g. Heysham \nand Morecambe, the amplitude computed by QUODDY is significantly increased (e.g. \nHeysham Calc 1M, hc = 39 cm, Calc 3M, hc = 50 cm and Morecambe Calc 1M, hc = 66 cm, \nCalc 3M, hc = 83 cm).  This increase in M4 amplitude computed with QUODDY in shallow \nnear coastal regions is particularly strong in the Barrow region as shown in Fig. 8b.  Although \nthere is consistent agreement in the amplitude between solutions computed with both codes, \nthere is some variation in the phase close to the coast.  It is not clear what is the reason for \nthese differences between the M4 solution in shallow water computed with TELEMAC and \nQUODDY. \n For the M6 component the cotidal chart (not presented) shows that outside the eastern \nIrish Sea there are some differences in the M6 amplitude computed with TELEMAC and \nQUODDY, in particular in the western Irish Sea, to the north of the M2 amphidromic point.  \nThis is different to that found with ADCIRC, although in general, outside the nearshore \nregion the M6 tide is small.  In the eastern Irish Sea M6 amplitude differences between \n 30 \nTELEMAC and QUODDY are appreciably larger (Table 2c), than those between TELEMAC \nand ADCIRC.  In addition the M6 amplitude computed with QUODDY changes very rapidly \nin the region of Barrow. \n From Table 2c, there does not appear to be a consistent difference between the M6 \ncomputed with TELEMAC and that derived with QUODDY.  However, as found for the M4 \ntide at locations where M6 is large e.g. Birkenhead and Morecambe, that computed with \nQUODDY is significantly larger than that derived with TELEMAC. \n It is evident from Table 4a, (Calc 3M) that as in Calcs 1M and 2M, when the \nminimum water depth is set at 5 m there is significantly less spatial variability in the \nQUODDY solution than found with TELEMAC or ADCIRC using realistic depths (e.g. \nCalcs 1 and 2).  As discussed previously, at all these shallow water locations the M2 \namplitude from QUODDY (Calc 3M) exceeds that from TELEMAC, which has the closest \nagreement with observed shallow water amplitudes.  This is in contrast to that found with \nADCIRC (Calc 2M) where the amplitude is underpredicted.  In terms of phase, that computed \nwith QUODDY (Calc 3M) is very slightly (of order 1\u00ba or 2\u00ba on average) higher than that \ncomputed with TELEMAC. \n For the M4 component of the tide, as for M2, using a minimum water depth removes \nthe spatial variability in the region of the nodes found with G3AX (Calc 3M, Table 4b).  In \naddition at most tidal locations the M4 amplitude computed with QUODDY (Calc 3M) is not \nappreciably different from that determined by TELEMAC (see Calcs 1M and 3M in Table \n4b).  However, as discussed in connection with Table 2b, at locations such as Morecambe \nwhere TELEMAC gives a large M4 tide (Calc 1M), there is a tendency for QUODDY to \ncompute a larger amplitude than TELEMAC (compare Calcs 1M and 3M, Table 4b).  For M4 \nphase, on average that computed with QUODDY is of the order 10\u00ba below that computed \nwith TELEMAC (compare Calcs 3M and 1M, Table 4b). \n 31 \n Considering the M6 component of the tide,  as found for TELEMAC and ADCIRC, \nthere is significantly less variability at nodal positions surrounding the observational point \nwhen the minimum depth is set at 5 m.  In addition as discussed previously, at a number of \nshallow water locations, namely Barrow RI, Barrow HP and Morecambe, QUODDY has a \ntendency to overpredict the M6 tidal amplitude compared with TELEMAC and ADCIRC, and \nat Barrow HS , it underpredicts the phase (Table 4c).  However at other locations e.g. \nFleetwood, the amplitude is in good agreement with the other solutions, although the phase is \ntoo low (see Table 4c).  The reason for this is not clear, although it is evident from Table 4c, \nthat even when a minimum depth is set at 5 m, there is significant variability in the M6 \nsolution computed with the various models. \nCONCLUDING REMARKS \n Three finite element codes, namely TELEMAC, ADCIRC and QUODDY with two \ndifferent finite element meshes, namely G3AX, which resolves the detailed nearshore eastern \nIrish Sea topography, and G3AX5M which does not, have been used to compute the spatial \ndistribution of the M2, M4 and M6 tides over the west coast of Britain.  This region was \nchosen because an existing finite difference uniform coarse grid (7 km) model solution of the \nregion existed, in addition to a solution from a fine resolution (1 km) eastern Irish Sea model.  \nAlso a detailed observational data set was available over the region for comparison purposes, \nparticularly in the eastern Irish Sea where higher harmonics of the M2 tide were produced. \n In all calculations the same open boundary forcing and water depth distribution to that \nused in earlier finite difference calculations was employed.  By this means all finite element \nmodels were forced in the same way and had identical water depths.  Consequently there was \nno bias in the solution obtained by adjusting the input or water depths in one model compared \nto another.  Also the same bottom friction coefficient, that was constant over the whole \nregion, and bottom stress formulation was used in all calculations.  This however is a major \n 32 \napproximation, in that as shown by Aldridge and Davies (1993) there is significant variation \nin bed types and bed forms over the eastern Irish Sea which should be taken into account in \nany attempt at a highly accurate simulation of the tides.  In addition to this as shown in JD96, \nother tidal constituents in particular S2, N2, K1 and O1 need to be included in order to get the \ncorrect level of frictional dissipation.  Consequently a \u201ctrue model-model and model-data \nintercomparison\u201d has been performed in the sense that no optimization was performed, rather \nthan the \u201cconventional skill assessment\u201d where a model-data comparison is performed after \noptimizing the model.  However, as discussed previously this falls short of a \u201ctrue skill \nassessment\u201d of the predictive capabilities of a range of finite element models, but is \nsomewhat different to the \u201cconventional skill assessment\u201d of a single model where a model-\ndata comparison is performed after the model has been optimized in terms of friction etc.  In \naddition by using a range of finite element models, with identical forcing and water depths \nany bias in a particular model for example to over\/under predict amplitude and phase in a \nconsistent manner could be identified and the model adjusted for future use.  For example an \nunder-prediction of amplitude and over-prediction of phase could indicate enhanced \nnumerical dissipation that could be corrected by using a less dissipative algorithm.  However, \nas shown in the calculations and discussed later such simple biases between models did not \noccur, due to the complex physical nature of tidal propagation and the high non-linearity of \nthe solution in this region. \n For example initial calculations with TELEMAC and ADCIRC showed that even for \nthe M2 tide with a detailed topographic data set there were differences in amplitude and phase \nover the whole region.  These appeared to arise from the fact that the two models gave \nslightly different locations for the amphidromic point off the southeast coast of Ireland.  This \ngave rise to, on average a 30 cm difference in amplitude and 8\u00ba difference in phase for the M2 \ntide in the eastern Irish Sea computed with the two models, with the TELEMAC solution in \n 33 \nthis region in closer agreement with observations.  However, as found in previous finite \ndifference calculations (DJ92, Davies and Kwong  2000) the location of amphidromic points \nin the interior of large domain models is sensitive to small changes in open boundary forcing.  \nThis is true in the present case, but since the open boundary forcing was taken from an \naccurate earlier finite difference model (DJ92) no adjustment had been made in any finite \nelement calculation.  Consequently although the significant differences between TELEMAC \nand ADCIRC in the eastern Irish Sea might at first sight be attributed to differences in \nnumerical damping in shallow water, in practice it is probably due to small subtle differences \nin model formulation, which slightly moves the position of the M2 tidal amphidromic point. \n This difference in M2 in the eastern Irish Sea subsequently feeds into the local M4 in \nthis region. Thus, a consequence of the larger M2 tidal amplitude computed with TELEMAC \nthan ADCIRC is that the M4 amplitude is also larger in the eastern Irish Sea.  This suggests \nthat to get a correct M4 tide, the model must be able to accurately compute the M2 tide, not \nonly in the region of the M2 amphidrome, but as it propagates into the eastern Irish Sea.  At \nfirst sight, differences in M4 distributions between models in the eastern Irish Sea may be \nattributed to numerical differences in the non-linear momentum advection terms, since these \nare primarily responsible for M4 generation.  Certainly this would be so for the idealized case \nof a one dimensional solution of a tidal wave propagating into shallower water.  In such a \ncase any reduction in higher harmonics could be readily attributed to artificial viscosity \nintroduced into the finite element representation of momentum advection.  However as \nshown here in a \u201ctrue model-model assessment\u201d the reason can be more complex and relate \nto \u201cfar field\u201d errors in M2 tidal propagation.   \nFor M6 both TELEMAC and ADCIRC exhibit significant spatial variability in the \nnear coastal region over relatively short distances.  In addition neither model exhibits good \nagreement with observations which also show appreciable small scale variability.  One reason \n 34 \nfor this, as discussed in JD96, is that in order to get an accurate M6 tide it is essential to have \nan accurate description of bottom friction and this requires the inclusion of other tidal \nconstituents (namely S2, N2, K1 and O1).  However, even without these constituents, and \nignoring the observations that are generally small which could be prone to error, it is evident \nfrom a comparison of TELEMAC and ADCIRC M6 computations, that there are appreciable \ndifferences in the solutions and there is no clear trend in this difference.  This is a different \nsituation from that found for the M2 and M4 tide where there were consistent large scale \ndifferences in the solution.  This suggests that these differences in M6 may arise from small \nscale nearshore topographic variations in water depth that are unresolved even on the fine \nnearshore eastern Irish Sea grid used here, or due to differences in model formulation.  \nHowever, even when a minimum nearshore depth of 5 m is used in the calculation, it is \napparent that there are changes in the M6 tide computed with TELEMAC, ADCIRC and \nQUODDY.  In an idealized calculation such as that involving tidal propagation in a one \ndimensional shallowing estuary, then changes in the M6 tide between different models can in \npart be related to how they parameterize and discretize the bottom friction term.  However, as \nshown here, because of differences in the M2 and M4 tides compared with the different \nmodels, the reason is more complex.  However, some of the difference in the M6 solution \nmust arise from differences in model formulation, and the possibility of under-resolving this \ncomponent of the tide in the nearshore region.  In addition the absence of other tidal \nconstituents and the use of a single friction coefficient over the whole domain must be a \nsource of error.  As shown by Aldridge and Davies (1993) and Davies and Lawrence (1995) \nbed types vary significantly over the eastern Irish Sea, suggesting an appreciable variation in \nbottom drag coefficient (Nicolle and Karpytchev 2007).  To this end, further calculations are \nin progress with the use of additional tidal constituents, bed type dependent friction and \nenhanced nearshore resolution.  For a large number of nearshore processes (e.g. Levasseur et \n 35 \nal 2007), such as sediment transport and the spread of pollutants it is essential to have a \ncorrect description of both the M2 component of the tide and its higher harmonics as well as \nthe tidal residual (Jones and Davies 2007b).  To this end further work is in progress to \nimprove the tidal description of the eastern Irish Sea. \nThe calculations presented here, clearly show that a model skill assessment based \nupon model-data comparison after the model has been optimized in one particular region may \nnot be a true indication of model accuracy in other regions.  In addition by comparing results \nfrom three models that have not been optimized for the area examined, it is clear that small \ndifferences in the location of the M2 tidal amphidromic point can feed through to significant \ndifferences in the M2, M4 and M6 tides in shallow regions.  These differences are primarily \ncaused by \u201cfar field\u201d effects (i.e. small inaccuracies in location of the M2 amphidrome) rather \nthan differences in model algorithms, that might at first sight be thought to be the principal \nfactor.  This clearly shows the limitations of interpreting local deficiencies in a model \ncontaining a range of physical processes and covering a wide domain, in terms of results that \nare found using very idealized calculations of limited domains.   \nIn terms of a rigorous \u201cskill assessment\u201d of a number of models this suggests that \nbesides accurate validation data, detailed accurate open boundary conditions are required at \nsufficient locations (see Davies (1976) for a discussion of this) to provide accurate and \nunbiased model forcing. In addition a detailed accurate topographic data set, containing not \nonly water depths, but bed types and forms is required, particularly in the near shore region, \nbearing in mind that close to the coast these can change between major storm events.  At \npresent no such comprehensive data sets exist, and the cost of making the necessary \nmeasurement would be large. In essence the model intercomparison exercise presented here, \nreinforces the conclusions reached by Roed et al. (1995), concerning the difficulties of \nformulating and carrying out rigorous model intercomparisons. \n 36 \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n The origin of the TELEMAC system is EDF-LNHE and is therefore \u00a9EDF-LNHE.  \nThe authors are indebted to R.A.
