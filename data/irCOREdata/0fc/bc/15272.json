Foxall\nb\n \n \na\n Durham Business School, UK; \nb \nCardiff Business School, Cardiff University, Cardiff \n \nConsumer Behaviour Analysis is a synthesis of behavioural economics with the real \nworld complexities of consumer choice in a marketing-oriented economy (Foxall, 2001). \nBehavioural economics, based on the integration of operant behaviour theory and \nexperimental economics, has made enormous strides in the explanation of choice \nbehaviour in terms of its environmental consequences. Much of the earlier work involved \nnonhuman subjects but there is now a well-established volume of research findings on \nhuman choice in economic situations. Consumer behaviour analysis adds a further \ndimension to this work by combining it with marketing science, the empirical study of \npatterns of consumer choice in affluent, marketing-oriented economies.    \n The foundations of consumer behaviour analysis were set out in an inaugural \nessay at the beginning of the Millennium (Foxall, 2001) and research to that point was \nextensively reviewed in the three volumes of Consumer Behaviour Analysis: Critical \nPerspectives in Business and Management (Foxall, 2002). Theoretical and empirical \nresearch, which has proceeded apace during the last decade, has recently been reviewed \n(Foxall, 2007, 2009, 2011; Foxall, Oliveira-Castro, James & Schrezenmaier, 2007; \nHantula & Wells, 2010) and will not be rehearsed here.    \n                                                 \n1\n Corresponding author. Email: VictoriaWells@hotmail.co.uk \n Rather, this special issue reports on current work on consumer behaviour analysis \nthat was presented at the 2\nnd\n International Symposium on Consumer Behaviour Analysis \nheld in Cardiff in April 2010 in order to provide a flavour of current thinking and \nempirical investigation in the area.  \nConsumer behaviour analysis developed largely in response to the cognitive \ndomination of consumer behaviour research and the need to explore alternative accounts \nof consumer choice (Foxall, 2010). Concurrently with the development of consumer \nbehaviour analysis the core of behaviour analysis was also developing and breaking new \nground in the application of behavioural concepts and theories to the empirical \nunderstanding of a diverse range of psychological phenomena in what Roche (1999) \ncalled a \u2017new wave\u2018 of behavioural psychology.  However whilst behaviour principles are \ncentral to consumer behaviour analysis\u2018s theoretical and empirical research programme \nthe philosophical and methodological influences go beyond the academic disciplines \nknow as \u2017experimental analysis of behaviour\u2018 or \u2017behaviour analysis\u2018 (Foxall 2001) and \nthe papers included here reflect this. \nThe basic paradigm of behaviour analysis, the \u2017three term contingency\u2018 or SD \uf0e0R \n\uf0e0 SR where SD is a cue or \u2017discriminative stimulus\u2018, R is a \u2017response\u2018 and SR is a reward \nor \u2017reinforcing stimulus\u2018 provides the base for the Behavioural Perspective Model (BPM) \nwhich forms part of the work of consumer behaviour analysis. The BPM is an \ninterpretative devise that results from the combination of consumer behaviour setting \nscope, consumer behaviour and it\u2018s (utilitarian, information and aversive) consequences \nas signalled by the stimuli that comprise the setting (the development and subsequent \nrefinement of the BPM are described by Foxall 1990, 2007, 2010). \nConsumer behaviour analysis represents a truly interdisciplinary approach to \nconsumer choice, as can be seen by the author affiliations contained here which include \nbusiness schools, psychology departments and technology schools.  CBA also celebrates \na diversity of viewpoints. It is not, and has not been developed to be, an attempt to assert \nthe importance of behavioural psychology to the exclusion of cognitive or other \nperspectives on consumer choice. In fact, Foxall (2001) states that a central component of \nthe model is to use competing concurrent theories of behaviour as standpoints from \nwhich to critique one another. Recent theoretical work has emphasized this broader \ntheoretical perspective (Foxall, 2007). A number of the papers within the edition actively \nand directly compare, contrast and in some cases integrate with existing conventional \nwisdom in their respective areas. \nOn a spectrum of products from pure services to pure tangible goods the research \non consumer behaviour analysis has developed from the pure goods end of the spectrum \nbut through its work on branding has also provided implications for services in much of \nits work. Projects have explored the brand and product choice of consumers via a \nmatching analysis (Foxall and James 2001, Foxall and James 2003, Romero, Foxall, \nSchrezenmaier, Oliveira-Castro and James 2006, Foxall, Oliveira-Castro, James and \nSchrezenmaier 2006, Foxall, Oliveira-Castro, James and Schrezenmaier 2007), via panel \ndata (Foxall, Wells, Chang and Oliveira-Castro 2010, Wells, Chang, Oliveira-Castro and \nPallister 2010) and experimentation in-store (Sigurdsson, V., S\u00e6varsson, H., & Foxall \n2009) and online (Fagerstr\u00f8m, Arntzen and Foxall 2009, Fagerstr\u00f8m 2010). It has also \nexplored the philosophical basis of consumer behaviour analysis and verbal behaviour of \nconsumers (Foxall 2009) as well as the evolutionary bases of consumer reinforcement \n(Nicholson and Xiao 2010).  A number of studies within consumer behaviour analysis \nhave also explored consumers emotional responses to consumer environments (Foxall \nand Yani-de-Soriano 2005, Yani-de-Soriano 2006) a viewpoint directly build on by Seco-\nFerreira and Oliveira-Castro and Xiao and Nicholson in this issue.   The papers in this \nspecial edition are, for most of the established consumer behaviour analysis researchers \nincluded, a first tentative step into the world of services marketing.  Because of this the \npapers within the edition are situated largely in the middle of the product spectrum, \nexploring the facilitating and supplementary nature of services to support product sales \nwhere goods are a complex of goods with facilitating services and services are a mixture \nof a complex of services and facilitating goods (Rathmell 1966).  Retailing is important \nhere both as a major employer and also a major service industry (Jobber 2010) \nincorporating both product sales and a range of surrounding services including delivery, \nfinancing, customer interaction, the service environment etc.  Aspects of retailing form \nthe main thrust of a number of papers within the special edition with atmospherics or the \nenvironment of retail being the most popular.    Marketing has long recognised within this \nthe physical environment as an effective tool incorporating it fully into retail \ndevelopment and services research (for example Martineau 1958, Kotler 1973, Donovan \nand Rossiter 1982 Bitner 1992, Foxall and Greenley 1999, Turley and Milliman 2000, \nTsai 2010).  Kotler (1973) is credited with being the first researcher to introduce and \ndiscuss the significance of the physical environment on enhancement of consumers \nexperience and exploring its effect on evaluation, purchase and post-purchase stages of \nconsumer behaviour. He used the term atmospherics to describe the \"effort to design \nbuying environments to produce specific emotional effects in the buyer that enhance his \npurchase probability\" (p. 5O). While the term atmospherics is still widely used terms such \nas shelf-space studies, environmental psychology and servicescape are all also used in the \nliterature exploring environmental affects on consumers (Turley and Milliman 2000). As \nmany of these studies base their theoretical approach on the three term contingency the fit \nwith a consumer behaviour analysis is logical and is exploited within this issue.  \nThe special issue contains, as consumer behaviour analysis itself, many different \ntypes of paper:  both conceptual and discursive (for example Nicholson and Xiao, Xiao \nand Nicholson), and empirical (for example Fagerstr\u00f8m, Arntzen and Foxall).  The \nempirical papers also include a wide range of data collection and methodologies from \nqualitative (for example Porto, Oliveira-Castro and Seco-Ferreira) to quantitative (for \nexample Xiao and Nicholson) and using triangulation\/multiple methods (for example \nFagerstr\u00f8m, Arntzen and Foxall).  Some data is collected via laboratory experimentation \n(for example Fagerstr\u00f8m, Arntzen and Foxall), some via the service setting itself (for \nexample Porto, Oliveira-Castro and Seco-Ferreira).  Some uses individual data (for \nexample Fagerstr\u00f8m, Arntzen and Foxall and Porto, Oliveira-Castro and Seco-Ferreira) \nwhile others use aggregated data (for example. Sigurdsson, Larsen and Gunnarsson).   \nThe first two papers, \u2015Mapping impulse buying:  A systematic review for services \nmarketing and consumer research\u2016 and \u2015Consumer behaviour analysis and social \nmarketing practice\u2016 are theoretical and conceptual in nature.  Both papers take a popular \naspect of both services and more general marketing and engage with the current wisdom \nfrom a consumer behaviour analysis viewpoint.  \u2015Mapping Impulse Buying\u2016, proposes \nconsumer behaviour analysis as an integrative framework to synthesise existing empirical \nand theoretical work in this area.  This paper makes direct comparison between a \nconsumer behaviour analysis interpretation of impulse buying and other models \ndeveloped from behavioural economics (e.g. discounting behaviour) as well as the more \ncognitive studies which have dominated the field.  The authors propose that their \nsystematic approach to building a strong theoretical base for impulse buying research will \nallow a deeper understanding of how consumers engage in impulse buying and the value \nof this for services providers in attempting to develop marketing strategies that will \ninfluence consumers.  The paper also provides illuminating suggestions and directions for \nfurther research.   \nThe second paper, \u2015Consumer behaviour analysis and social marketing practice\u2016 \ncovers a number of related areas including health services, organ donation, healthy eating, \ndietary change campaigns, promotion of good purchases, drug use, the impact of \npenalties and environmental behaviour and its ideas could easily be expanded into several \npapers.  The paper also provides the most comprehensive introduction to all main areas \nwithin the Behavioural Perspective Model (BPM) and is a good starting point for readers \nunfamiliar with this model.  This is the most wide ranging paper included within the \nspecial issue, and perhaps the one, that at the surface level appears to be most distant \nfrom core services research.  However, behavioural change and an understanding of the \nmotivations behind this is important to all service industries which are reliant on \nconsumers and employees good behaviour and hard work, demonstrated by the P of \npeople within the extended services marketing mix.  Deviance is a current popular area of \nservices research, and the section on crime within this paper highlights a number of \nimplications for deviant behaviour.  The behaviour of consumers (more commonly \npatients in this area) is of vital importance in determining the demand for healthcare \nservices, whether privately or via a public system such as the NHS.  Overall the paper \npresents consumer behaviour analysis as a theoretical approach for a more robust \napproach to social marketing practice.  The remaining six papers are empirical, exploring \na number of different areas of study. \nThe paper by Sigurdsson, Larsen and Gunnarsson looks specifically at demand \ncurves and is one of a number of papers that concentrates on retailing.   The paper uses \nreal time, real life purchasing on which it experiments in a number of different retailers.  \nThe authors discuss the effect of in-store price manipulations on consumers demand \ncurves, evaluating their findings in terms of the BPM and consider the effects of store \ntype and level of analysis on their results.  They specifically explore, with reference to \nprevious in store experimentation and panel data analysis, the specific effects of closed \nand open settings (where consumers have more or less control) and attempt to extend \nresearch in the area beyond the use of closed experimental conditions.   \nAdding to the idea of impulsivity presented by Xiao and Nicholson, Porto, \nOliveira-Castro and Seco-Ferreira take an empirical approach to retail effects on planned \npurchases by consumers.  Porto, Oliveira-Castro and Seco-Ferreira describe their study as \na natural experiment, questioning consumers in situ, both as they enter and exit the store, \nand underline the importance of a study that relies on real behavioural data rather than \nsimply behavioural intentions, a central aspect within CBA.  While they consider the \ninfluence of brands, and in particular the informational and utilitarian benefits proposed \nby the BPM, they also make strong managerial implications as to the possible effects of \nthe retail environment on planned and impulse purchases and the balance and interactions \nbetween them.  They strongly suggest that retailers may have the greatest effect on \naltering consumers planned purchases and increasing impulse purchasing when \nconsumers are buying luxury, or higher benefit goods which they suggest produce greater \n\u2017confusion\u2018 within the purchase situation.  This may lead retailers to question their \nproduct mix as to ensure luxury products, or at least higher level brands are available and \nwhere they can have most influence within the retail environment.   \nSeco-Ferreira and Oliveira-Castro explore another aspect of the consumer setting, \nbackground music, in line with its affects on the overall \u2017consumer experience\u2018.  The \npupose of the paper was to explore the effects of atmospherics, specifically background \nmusic quality, on conversion rates, cash flow and consumers\u2018 impressions of the \nshopping environment.  The authors frame the consumer setting within the BPM \nframework as atmospherics and explore a behavioural analystic response to the \nmanipulation of atmospheric variables.  The authors used both observation data, via video \nrecording, and questionnaires to assess the affects of the background music used.  The \nquestionnaire ulitised the Mehrbian and Russell PAD emotion scales aligning itself with \nconsumer behaviour analysis work exploring consumers\u2018 emotional responses \nconsumption environments and also a range of services literature utilising emotions (for \nexample Li, Kim and Lee 2009).   \nSigurdsson, Larsen and Gunnarsson, in their paper on the selection of fruit and \nvegetables present another live in-store experiment with real consumers.  This paper \nexplores specifically the effects of the retail environment (this time in the positioning of \ngoods and in-store advertising) on encouraging consumers to make the right purchases \nand links well with the proposals made by Nicholson and Xiao with regards social \nmarketing practice and promoting behaviour change. They study the important concept of \nthe \u2015obesogenicity\u2016 of the modern environment which is defined as the sum of influences \nthat the surroundings, opportunities or conditions of life have on promoting obesity in \nindividuals or populations.  As with the paper above this paper employed in-store \nobservation as well as a consumer survey.  Once more the paper takes a comparison \napproach comparing the interpretation of consumer behaviour via both the BPM and, in \nthis case, social psychological intentionality.  The authors conclude that in many cases \nthe interventions employed had little effect of the buying behaviour of consumers, with \nconsumers often saying they wanted to make the \u2017right\u2018 purchase choice but not in \npractice doing this.  One aspect that appeared to affect the behaviour was the type of \nstore, an aspect that could lead to useful further research.   \nThe penultimate paper, Fagerstr\u00f8m, Arntzen and Foxall explores the areas of \nsatisfaction, loyalty and retail variables within online technology stores.  Satisfaction and \nloyalty have received increased attention in recent years (see for example Sun and Lin \n2010, Chen and Kao 2010, Lee 2010) as companies utilising relationship marketing \ntechniques have tried to retain consumers and as interest has also risen in deviant and \ncomplaining behaviour (see for example Casado-D\u00edaz and Gonz\u00e1lbez 2009, Iglesias 2009) \nas well as service recovery (Lin 2010). The impact of environmental characteristics on \nretail websites has also become an increasingly popular area of research in line with the \ngrowth of internet purchasing (see for example Kim, Kim and Kandampully 2007) and \nthe experimental design of this study allowed the authors to control the reinforcement \navailable to the participants to a great level.  The authors were therefore also able to be \nvery specific about the effects of the programmed reinforcement they used, in this case \nfree shipment.  While free shipment, and in some cases the colour of the online stores \nused, had an effect on the behaviour of the participants the authors found, more generally, \nthat few of the consumers showed loyalty to either store regardless of the reinforcement \navailable.  This paper follows a strong behavioural economic\/behavioural psychology \nmethodology using experimental analysis in a stimulated \u2017micro world\u2018 to explore the \nbehaviour, and loyalty of the participants.  However unlike a strong behavioural \neconomic\/behavioural psychology methodology the authors also used a multiple methods \napproach (post participation interviews) to allow greater exploration and understanding of \ntheir data. \nThe final paper in the special edition, \u2015Situational variations in consumers\u2018 \nconsideration of non-deceptive counterfeits\u2016 brings together both theoretical and \nempirical aspects.  The ideas within this paper are embedded within aspects of \nconsideration sets are tested empirically via the BPM model and specifically the benefits \nwithin it.  The paper considers the environment in which purchase decisions are made \nand also the effects of the usage situations on the consumers\u2018 consideration of the \npurchase of both counterfeit trademark and service mark products (e.g., clothes, watch, \nrestaurant, hotel service etc) and pirated copyright goods (e.g., software, music etc).  The \nauthors found that both utilitarian and informational benefits were significant in the \nconsumers behaviour with usage reason (e.g. social status, altruism, reputation etc) also \nbeing of importance. \nThis special issue comes at a very exciting time in the evolution of CBA and \nrepresents a significant development in its scope.  In 2001, Foxall described CBA as \nenjoying its inaugural phase.  Ten years later, CBA has grown substantively not only in \nits popularity, but in its theoretical and methodological depth and in its range of \napplications. We celebrate some of them in this special issue. \nReferences \nBitner, M.J. 1992.
