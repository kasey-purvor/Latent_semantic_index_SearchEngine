While \nit can be called a \u2018voluntary agreement\u2019, it was established in response to the \nregulatory threat of the German Packaging Ordinance to impose individual col-\nlection and recycling duties for every packaging producer and distributor. The \nDSD fulfils most of the conditions for a successful voluntary agreement. Ger-\nman packaging waste management is less successful in its environmental ef-\nfects, however, as it prioritises recycling over waste avoidance. Whereas avoid-\nance can save the full resource and energy content of economised packages, re-\ncycling leads to a partial recovery of the natural resources and energy embod-\nied in waste packages only. The EU Packaging Waste Directive follows the basic \nprinciple of the German Packaging Ordinance and similar systems as DSD have \nbeen established in other European countries. There is the danger that a specific \nform of packaging waste management becomes locked in which sets free an \ninnovative potential for recycling technologies, but neglects a similar potential \nfor waste avoidance. \n \n3 \nINTRODUCTION \nIf Voluntary Agreements (VAs) were really \u2018unforced by law and unpersuaded \nby financial incentives\u2019, as an often quoted definition would have it (Jacobs \n1991, p. 134), then few agreements could really be called voluntary. Instead, \nVAs often come about as the response of the private sector to the threat by pub-\nlic authorities to introduce binding, i.e. non-voluntary, regulation. In other \nwords: the private sector swallows the bitter pill of self-regulation in order to \nfight off the even more dreadful medicine of binding public regulation. In real-\nity, therefore, one can observe a plethora of VAs with a varying degree of im-\npact of public authorities (Sinclair 1997). \nA prime example of a VA that is voluntary in nothing but its name is the Du-\nales System Deutschland AG (DSD), an association of the German packaging \nindustry set up for the purpose of collecting, sorting and recycling packaging \nwaste. Formally, the DSD is a voluntary association: it originated in the private \nsector and no packaging company can be forced to join it. In substance, how-\never, its installation was the only chance for the industry to escape the individual \nduty of every producer and distributor of packages to collect used consumption \ngood packages from the consumer and recycle them. According to \u00a76 section 3 \nof the initial German Packaging Ordinance (Verpackungsverordnung) from 1991, \nthis individual duty could only be waived if from 1st of January 1993 onwards \nthe industry as a whole provided a system in its own responsibility that would \nguarantee the collection of packaging waste from all consumers and would ful-\nfil certain quotas of collection, sorting and recycling. \n4 \nIn its first and major part, this article provides a critical assessment of the \nDSD. In its second part it discusses the wider European Union policy context \nwith regard to packaging waste. To do so is imperative as the European Union \nPackaging Waste Directive 94\/62\/EC follows the same basic idea as the Ger-\nman Ordinance. In short, the article argues that while the DSD fulfils most of \nthe conditions for a successful voluntary agreement, it has been much less suc-\ncessful in its environmental effects. This is because it prioritises recycling of \npackaging waste over waste avoidance. Neither the DSD nor the underlying \nPackaging Ordinance has set up any significant provisions for the avoidance of \npackaging waste. \nIn addition to publicly available documents, the article is based on non-\nstandardised interviews undertaken with representatives from DSD, the Ger-\nman federal environment ministry and the Bund f\u00fcr Umwelt- und Naturschutz, \nwhich has a specifically national focus and is the biggest German environ-\nmental pressure group apart from Greenpeace. These interviews were merely \nundertaken to gain information and insights, which were not readily accessible \notherwise, and no pretence of representativity is made here. \n \n \n5 \nDUALES SYSTEM DEUTSCHLAND: A SUCCESSFUL VA \nWhile VAs usually are the instrument for environmental management pre-\nferred by the private sector1, environmentalists are often less enthusiastic about \nthem (Jenkins 1995; European Environment Agency 1997, p. 50). Their major \nconcern is that VAs might lead to a watering down of environmental protection \nstandards. Game theoretic analysis by Segerson and Miceli (1998) and Schmel-\nzer (1999) shows that under certain conditions the environmental standard ne-\ngotiated in a VA will always be less than the standard that would be imposed \nvia binding public regulation. Additionally, Bizer (1999) argues that VAs are \noften agree upon by the private sector to buy time and to delay more substan-\ntial environmental protection measures into the distant future.. On the other \nhand, there do exist VAs that seem to function quite successfully and do not \nappear to come about at the expense of environmental standards (Bizer and \nJ\u00fclich 1999). \nFor a VA to be successful, it has to fulfil a number of conditions, however. \nThe most common ones to be found in the relevant literature can be summa-\nrised as follows (see, for example, Preimesberger 1997; European Environment \nAgency 1997; Rennings et al. 1996; SRU 1998; Bizer and J\u00fclich 1999): \n \n                                                 \n1 But see Eden (1997) for the notable exception of the UK packaging industry. \n6 \n\u2022 the targets need to be clear and transparent and in a quantitative form. The \ntargets must cover the long-term, but intermediate goals need to be set up as \nwell. \n\u2022 the targets themselves must not be the object of the VA. Otherwise easily \nachieved targets are set up that are often nothing more but the codification \nof future business as usual projections.2 \n\u2022 compliance with the agreement as a whole needs to be ensured via backdrop \nregulatory threats. \n\u2022 external and internal free-riding needs to be deterred: no relevant compa-\nnies may stay outside the agreement and companies that sign up to the \nagreement must also follow its obligations. \n\u2022 the agreement needs to be monitored, supervised and verified and the \nevaluation made public. \n \nThe DSD fulfils most, if not all, of these conditions for a successful VA: \n\u2022 First, the German Packaging Ordinance and its amendments lay down \nquantitative targets for how much of a given type of packaging has to be re-\ncovered, that is, recycled (only in the case of plastics up to 40% of the col-\nlected packaging waste can be incinerated instead of recycled). See table 1 \nfor an overview.  \n                                                 \n2 As examples for this, see the German industry\u2019s \u2018Declaration on Global Warming Prevention\u2019 \n(Kristof and Ramesohl 1999) and many of the VAs in Denmark (Neale 1997). \n7 \n \n< INSERT TABLE 1 HERE > \n \n\u2022 Second, the targets are set exogenous to the DSD. They are set by the federal \ngovernment (Bundesregierung) with the approval of the federal parliament \n(Bundestag) and the chamber of state governments (Bundesrat). Of course, \nlobbying takes place for \u2018soft\u2019 targets. Intensive lobbying achieved, for ex-\nample, that the targets set in the original Packaging Ordinance from 1991 \nand as amended in 1993 were lowered in retrospect for 1996 in the 1998 \namendment, as the targets had not been achieved. Whereas with respect to \npaper\/cardboard, glass and aluminium these targets might not have been \nmuch stricter than what the industry would have found profitable to \nachieve in any case (SRU 1998, p. 211), at least with respect to plastics the \nGerman packaging industry had to engage in substantial investments to \nprovide the infrastructure for packaging waste collection and recovery \u2014 \nsee table 2 for an overview of costs. At least with respect to plastics, but to \nsome extent for other packaging types as well, the DSD cannot therefore be \ndenounced as undertaking something under the disguise of VA, which the \npackaging industry would have done anyway. Further evidence for this \nstems from the fact that several earlier attempts in the 1970s and 1980s to \npersuade the packaging sector to increase recycling rates failed because no \nalternative binding regulation was threatened (BUND 1988, p. 6; Rennings \net al. 1996, p. 248). \n8 \n \n< INSERT TABLE 2 HERE > \n \n\u2022 Third, the Packaging Ordinance and its amendments ensure compliance via \nbackdrop regulatory threats. \u00a76 section 4 of the Ordinance threatens to recall \nthe exemption from individual collection and recycling duties if the collec-\ntive system, i.e. the DSD, fails to ensure collection from all consumers and \nrecycling of packages according to the collective quotas in table 1. A special \nrule applies to beverage packages. According to \u00a78 section 2 of the Ordi-\nnance the share of re-usable beverage packages must not drop below 72%. If \nit does and continues to do so for a period of 12 months after the official an-\nnouncement of the failure to reach the target, then the federal government \nthreatens to introduce a compulsory deposit-refund system for those bever-\nages for which the target was missed. While these mechanisms appear to be \ncumbersome, a clear regulatory threat for non-compliance is existent at \nleast.3 As such, the DSD is different from many other VAs in Germany \n                                                 \n3 Possibly there will soon be a test whether the threat of a compulsory deposit-refund system is \ncredible: for the first time the 72% target was not reached in 1997. This failure is mainly due to \nthe strongly increasing use of non-reusable beer cans at the expense of reusable glass bottles. \nBetween February 1999 and January 2000 fulfilment of the target is re-examined. Federal envi-\nronment minister J\u00fcrgen Trittin has threatened to introduce a compulsory deposit-refund sys-\ntem for beer and mineral water in case of renewed failure to reach the target (Trittin 1999). \n9 \nwhich are of an informal nature and do not include sanctions for non-\ncompliance (European Environment Agency 1997, p. 29). \n\u2022 Fourth, free-riding has been successfully deterred by now. The DSD had \nenormous problems in the beginning with companies who did not join the \nDSD, did not pay the fees for packaging waste collection and recycling, but \nnevertheless used the so-called Green Dot, a special mark printed on pack-\nages with which packagers signalled their membership of DSD. Rennings et \nal. (1996, p. 261) estimate that up to 40% of packages with the Green Dot \noriginated from free-riders. This problem has now been successfully tackled \nby more stringent controls through DSD. Another free-riding problem was \nthat some companies refused to use the Green Dot and thereby refused to \njoin the collective system, declaring that they would collect and recycle their \npackaging waste individually. In reality, however, consumers did not check \nwhether packaging waste carried the Green Dot or not and disposed all \nwaste into the facilities provided by DSD without discrimination. As a con-\nsequence, companies that refused to join the collective system could in effect \nget away without providing an alternative individual system. This \nprompted DSD to call for binding public regulation to deter this kind of \nfree-riding. In August 1998 a new Packaging Ordinance came into force that \nrequires companies which do not license their packaging with DSD to meet \nby 2000 the same recycling targets as DSD and demands detailed documen-\ntation and proof for this. As a consequence, free-riding has all but vanished. \n10 \n\u2022 Fifth, monitoring, supervision and verification is minutely regulated. Ac-\ncording to Annex 2 of the Ordinance, the DSD has to document for each \ntype of packaging waste how much packaging has been produced, how \nmuch has been taken back from consumers and how much of it has been re-\ncycled. This documentation needs to be verified by an independent expert or \nenvironmental assessor and is made public. \n \n \nLESS SUCCESSFUL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS \nGiven that the DSD fulfils most, if not all, conditions for a successful VA, it \nmight be tempting to presume that it has also been successful in achieving sig-\nnificant environmental improvements in the packaging waste sector. Such a \npresumption would be overhasty, however. To start with, the system of packag-\ning waste collection and recycling is very expensive. As can be seen from table \n2, it costs the German economy around 4 billion DM per year (approximately \n\u00a31.3 billion). This represents a very high cost indeed, even if costs (expressed as \nlicence fees paid by members of DSD) in 1999 were reduced by 9.5% and DSD \npromises further reductions in the future (Br\u00fcck 1999).4 These high costs are \nproblematic for two reasons: first, in a world of scarce resources and therefore \nlimited willingness and ability to pay for environmental improvements, money \nthat is spent on one purpose is lost for another. Given that packaging waste \n                                                 \n4 The licence fee reduction led to a decrease of costs in per capita terms from about \u00a317 to \u00a315. \n11 \nrepresents merely about 24% of all household waste which in turn represents \nonly about 13% of all waste in Germany, about 4 billion DM are spent on han-\ndling a mere 3% of overall waste (Statistisches Bundesamt 1996). Indeed, as the \nmajority of costs accrue with respect to the recycling of but one fraction of \npackaging waste, namely plastics, the cost efficiency of achieving environ-\nmental benefits is rather dubious. Second, there is widespread uncertainty \nabout the actual environmental improvements the DSD has brought about. Any \nenvironmentally benign effect from packaging waste collection and recycling \nmust stem from either savings in landfill space and incineration capacities or in \nreductions in energy and natural resource use for the otherwise \u2018necessary\u2019 \nproduction of new packages.5 With respect to the first aspect, DSD collects \naround 5 million tonnes of packaging waste each year, which reduces pressures \non landfill and incineration facilities (DSD various years). On the other hand, \nthe severe shortages in these facilities from the late 1980s and early 1990s have \nnow given way to over-capacities, especially as concerns waste incineration, so \nthat this aspect does not play such an important role any longer (SRU 1998). \nWith respect to the second aspect, some of the natural resources and the energy \nembodied in the packages can be recovered via recycling, even if energy and \n                                                 \n5 In the case of plastic, part of the positive environmental effects can stem from a recovery of its \nenergy content via incineration. \n12 \nnatural resources are needed for the collection, sorting and recycling of packag-\ning waste.6 \nThe question remains, however, whether an alternative packaging waste \nmanagement policy could not lead to a higher reduction of natural resource and \nenergy use at the same or even at lower cost. From an environmental perspec-\ntive, the greatest reduction potential lies in the avoidance of waste rather than \nin waste collection and recycling (Kopytziok 1992). Recycling can only partially \nrecover the resources and the energy embodied in the recycled packages. Re-\nsources and energy are consumed in the process of collecting, transporting, \nprocessing, marketing and using the recycled materials. Given that ecologically \ncommitted scholars and environmental activists usually postulate reductions in \nresource and energy use by a factor of 4 as a target over the next 50 years or so \n(Ayres and Simonis 1994; Weizs\u00e4cker et al. 1996; Friends of the Earth 1999), it \nseems impossible to contribute substantially to reaching such an ambitious goal \nwith an emphasis on recycling rather than avoidance of waste. Furthermore, \npollution is produced at various stages of the recycling process. For example, \nthe recycling of aluminium produces substantial amounts of slag, which is con-\ntaminated with toxic metals and dioxines. The so-called de-inking of recycled \npaper causes contaminated sewage mud. Lastly, materials cannot be endlessly \n                                                 \n6 Unfortunately, there does not exist any comprehensive study quantifying the savings in en-\nergy and natural resources due to DSD. For the Bund f\u00fcr Umwelt und Naturschutz Deutsch-\nland, it is one of its major critiques that DSD does not have to document the environmental ef-\nfects of its system of collecting, sorting and recycling. \n13 \nrecycled. For example, the fibre length of paper is reduced in each cycle of recy-\ncling such that the fibres become too short and new cellulose has to be added. \nIn terms of avoidance the DSD\u2019s performance is rather poor, however. Ad-\nmittedly, it is not completely lacking incentives for avoidance. First, as every \npackage carries a licence fee, the DSD leads to an implicit price rise for packag-\ning, which decreases its consumption. Second, the licence fees are not only dif-\nferentiated according to the weight and either the volume or the surface of a \npackage, but also according to the type of package in that the respective recy-\ncling cost has some impact on the licence fee. Because of the differentiated li-\ncence fee structure there is a relative price incentive to substitute easily recycla-\nble packages for ones that are more difficult to recycle.7 According to Wolfgang \nBr\u00fcck, president of DSD, consumption of packages in Germany decreased by 13 \npercent between 1991 and 1998 (Br\u00fcck 1999). How much of this reduction can \nbe attributed to DSD is unclear, however, for two reasons. First, the amount of \nwaste more generally has stagnated or slightly decreased in Germany from \n1990 onwards (Statistisches Bundesamt 1996; Ewers et al. 1997). Second, accord-\ning to DSD figures the major reductions in packaging consumption have oc-\ncurred early on in the period between 1991 and 1998, so that DSD, which came \ninto effect in 1993, cannot be credited with achieving the full reduction. \n                                                 \n7 Critics argue, however, that in order to become environmentally more effective, the licence \nfees would need to reflect more strongly the relative differences in difficulty to recycle certain \npackaging types. On this, see the federal environment minister\u2019s proposal that licence fees \nshould better reflect ecological aspects, which is discussed further below. \n14 \nWhat is beyond doubt is that the packaging waste collection and recycling \nsystem as represented by DSD does not give the same weight to waste avoid-\nance as it gives to recycling, let alone prioritises avoidance.8 In many respects it \nrather encourages the consumption of packaging, which is contrary to the sol-\nemn declarations by both the packaging industry and former federal environ-\nment minister Angela Merkel that the Packaging Ordinance and DSD put em-\nphasis on waste avoidance (AG Verpackung und Umwelt 1990; Merkel 1998). \nThe \u2018Green Dot\u2019, its characteristic feature, suggests to consumers that in their \nconsumption they need not worry about the accompanying packaging waste, as \nit will be recycled rather than disposed of.9 It might thus in the first place lead \nto a decrease in environmental concern of consumers about the overall amount \nof packaging production and therefore, ceteris paribus, to an increase in its con-\nsumption. Already in 1990, the German Council of Environmental Advisors \n(Sachverst\u00e4ndigenrat f\u00fcr Umweltfragen) foresaw in a special report on waste man-\nagement the danger that the DSD would not contribute to the desired avoid-\nance of waste at the point of origin (SRU 1990, p. 4). The DSD might thus well \nbe in conflict with the fundamental norm in \u00a74 of the German Product Recy-\ncling and Waste Management Act from 1994 (Kreislaufwirtschafts- und Abfallge-\n                                                 \n8 Partly, this is because the German electricity supply industry took over substantial parts of the \npackaging and other waste management infrastructure in the late 1980s and early 1990s \n(Anonymous 1989a, 1989b). These pressure groups supported prioritising recycling as this \nwould guarantee profits to their investments. \n9 The colour green was selected on purpose, of course. \n15 \nsetz) which gives priority to waste avoidance over recycling and incineration (or \nenergetic utilisation (energetische Verwertung) as incineration is called somewhat \neuphemistically in the Act). \nIn some sense, of course, one could argue that the DSD, whose major pur-\npose is recycling, is the wrong target for blame with respect to the failure of \nsubstantial packaging waste avoidance. Following this argument, it is the Pack-\naging Ordinance itself or even the wider German policy with respect to packag-\ning waste management that is fundamentally flawed. In my view, such an ar-\ngument suggests a deceptive separateness of issues, however, as DSD is the ma-\njor component of the Packaging Ordinance and the cornerstone of German \npackaging waste management. Nevertheless, this argument has merit in putting \nemphasis on analysing the wider context in which DSD operates. As a next step, \nit is therefore appropriate to look at the future of packaging waste management \nin Germany. \n \n \nTHE FUTURE OF PACKAGING WASTE MANAGEMENT IN GERMANY \nThere are basically four possible options. One is to keep the system basically as \nit is now with small amendments. For example, Germany\u2019s federal environment \nminister J\u00fcrgen Trittin has proposed that the structure of licence fees that DSD \ncharges to the producers of packages should reflect ecological aspects more \nstrongly (Trittin 1999). In other words, the relative price for packages that are \ndifficult to recycle or are intensive in resource and energy consumption should \n16 \nincrease. For example, at the moment all plastic carries the same fee, but some \ntypes of plastic are easier to recycle than others. Such a strategy is likely to \nmake DSD somewhat more environmentally friendly, but will not lead to any \nsubstantial avoidance of packaging waste. For the special case of beverage con-\ntainers, it is unclear whether the deposit-refund system, that is threatened to \ncome into effect if the quota of reusable packages persistently falls short of 72%, \nwill be environmentally beneficial. Instead, it might even further increase the \nuse of non-reusable cans and thereby defeat its original purpose. This is because \na mandatory deposit-refund system on cans suggests environmental friendli-\nness to consumers who might no longer be able to distinguish between the dif-\nferent environmental effects of non-reusable and reusable systems and might \nprefer the lighter and more easily transportable cans to the heavier glass bottles. \nThe mandatory deposit-refund system might thus very well defeat its own pur-\npose of encouraging the use of reusable packages. This is a fundamental flaw \nsymptomatic of a system that is hostile towards levying taxes on or banning \nnon-reusable packages where alternatives exist. \nThe second option also keeps the system basically as it is now, but tries to re-\nduce its costs in taking small and difficult to recycle packaging waste, especially \nplastics, out of the system\u2019s coverage. These types of packaging wastes would \nbe labelled with a Red Dot instead of the Green Dot in order to signal to con-\nsumers that these should be disposed of with the normal household waste and \nshould not be put into the facilities provided by DSD. This proposal has been \naround for some time already (SRU 1998, p. 211). Because consumers have in \n17 \nthe past not distinguished between packaging waste that carried or did not \ncarry the Green Dot, it seems unrealistic to expect that consumers would distin-\nguish between packaging that carries the Green or the Red Dot, however. Apart \nfrom the practical feasibility of this option, its environmental soundness is open \nto question as well. It would cancel out the ongoing progress that is being \nachieved with automatic sorting technology and innovative recycling tech-\nniques for these types of packaging waste. DSD (1999b) expects that \u2018fully \nautomatic sorting technology will be the norm in the German waste disposal \nindustry by the middle of the next decade\u2019 and that the \u2018problem of packaging \nthat is \u201cdifficult to recycle\u201d or small will therefore resolve itself from a technical \npoint of view\u2019. \nThe third option is to keep the system of recycling, but to introduce along-\nside strong fiscal or regulatory incentives for waste avoidance. This could be \nachieved via a general tax on packages, via especially high taxes on non-\nreusable packages where reusable alternatives exist as in the case of beverages \nor even via an outright ban of certain environmentally unfriendly packages. \nEco-balances undertaken by the German Federal Environmental Agency (Um-\nweltbundesamt) show that reusable packaging for beverages is in general ecol-\nogically superior to non-reusable packaging, especially if the packaging is stan-\ndardised and the beverages come from regional production (Umweltbundesamt \n1996). This third policy option would be explicitly directed at waste avoidance \nand is likely to lead to the strongest reductions in packaging waste and in the \nconsumption of resources and energy. It is doubtful, however, whether such a \n18 \nstrategy would be consistent with European Union law. The EU and its Com-\nmission have so far been rather hostile towards the banning of certain packages \n(see the next section below). \nThe fourth option is to abandon all recycling targets and to abolish the DSD \nas a collective system. Such a position is held by some economists who call for a \nclearly market-oriented approach towards packaging waste management and \nregard the DSD as a major hindrance towards achieving free markets in the \nwaste sector.10 According to Ewers and Tegner (1998, p. 3) the government \nshould not determine how much waste is produced, avoided or recycled. The \nonly thing it should do is to ensure that all externalities of waste disposal are \ninternalised. The presumption is that the price signals following from internali-\nsation will work their way backwards through all markets and will lead to the \nefficient level of waste production, avoidance and recycling via the invisible \nhand of the market. Such a position ignores, however, that very often a full in-\nternalisation of externalities is impossible because of uncertainty and ignorance \nabout the complex effects of pollutants on ecosystems (Neumayer 1999, pp. 98-\n102). The identification and monitoring of environmental hazards and their as-\nsignment to specific pollutants is often impossible. Furthermore, such a position \nignores the fact that the major problems of packaging waste are not environ-\n                                                 \n10It is also a position shared by the German Council of Environmental Advisors (Sachverst\u00e4ndi-\ngenrat f\u00fcr Umweltfragen) (SRU 1998), which is not surprising as its member responsible for the \nwaste sector (Prof. Hans-J\u00fcrgen Ewers) is one of the major proponents of the market-oriented \napproach (Ewers et al. 1997). \n19 \nmental hazards in disposal, which are rather small, but the waste of scarce en-\nergy and natural resources in the process of packaging production, recycling or \ndisposal. As this fourth option is not likely to lead to substantial waste avoid-\nance and potentially leads to lower recycling rates, it is the least preferred op-\ntion from an environmental point of view. \nThe first option is likely to characterise the future of packaging waste man-\nagement. The second and the fourth option are unlikely because there is cur-\nrently no political party in Germany that wants to go this way. Also, such an \noption would clash with Germany\u2019s obligation to implement the European Un-\nion Packaging Waste Directive 94\/62\/EC, which prescribes the basic idea of the \nGerman Packaging Ordinance for all EU countries in setting minimum targets \nfor packaging waste recovery (see below). \nThe third option is also not likely to become reality. Any further fiscal or \nregulatory interventions in the packaging sector would face furious hostility by \nthe packaging sector. After all, it has originally agreed on the DSD merely to \nfight off more far-reaching regulation. While environmentalists and possibly \nminority factions of the ruling Social Democratic and Green parties could sup-\nport this option, it is unlikely that they could gain a majority within their party, \nlet alone convince the federal government to engage in a new conflict with the \nindustry. \n \n \n20 \nTHE EUROPEAN UNION CONTEXT \nTurning to the wider European Union context, the most important policy inia-\ntive has been the EU Packaging Waste Directive 94\/62\/EC. Similar to the basic \nidea of the German Packaging Ordinance, Article 6 of the Directive requires \nmember countries to achieve a minimum target of 50% of packaging waste ma-\nterials to be recovered from the waste stream no later than five years after im-\nplementation of the Directive. An exemption to this general rule applies to \nGreece, Ireland and Portugal, which are required to recover merely 25% ini-\ntially and 50% only from 2006 onwards. Article 7 encourages the \u2018participation \nof the economic operators of the sectors concerned\u2019 and thus effectively encour-\nages the establishing of VAs for packaging waste treatment in the European \nUnion member states. In Austria, Belgium, France, Ireland, Luxembourg, Spain \nand Portugal the packaging sector has set up associations similar to the DSD. \nThe DSD has played an active role in encouraging this process in transferring \nits copyright for the \u2018Green Dot\u2019 to the Packaging Recovery Organisation \nEurope (PRO EUROPE) in Brussels in December 1996, which in turn grants user \nrights to the mentioned associations outside Germany. According to DSD \n(1999a) around 212 million people in the European Union now consume goods \nthat carry the \u2018Green Dot\u2019. To some extent, therefore, the German Packaging \nOrdinance and DSD functioned as a role model for the EU Directive and the \ndevelopments in European packaging waste management. \nAs with the German Ordinance, the Directive does not contain any substan-\ntial incentives for packaging waste avoidance. Caps on the overall amount of \n21 \npackaging waste were originally envisaged in a pre-draft of the Directive, but \nhad to be cancelled due to opposition from member states and lobbying pres-\nsure by the packaging sector (Golub 1996, p. 7 and 9). What remained in the \nDirective are non-binding statements such as \u2018the best means of preventing the \ncreation of packaging waste is to reduce the overall volume of packaging\u2019 and \nthe allowance for member states to \u2018encourage reuse systems of packaging (...) \nin conformity with the Treaty\u2019 in Article 5. That these provisions can hardly be \nconsidered more than vague phrases, can be inferred from the fact that the \nCommission regularly quarrels with member states, which actually try to en-\ncourage reuse systems of packaging. For example, the Commission has sent so-\ncalled reasoned opinions to Germany regarding its Packaging Ordinance regu-\nlations \u2018which continue to promote the re-use of packaging materials\u2019 and to \nDenmark \u2018as metal cans for drinks and other types of non-reusable packaging \nare banned there\u2019 (European Commission 1999, p. 32).11 \nIn many other respects, the Directive is even less environmentally friendly \nthan the German Ordinance. The reason is that the Directive does not simply \nfollow the German role model, but represents a compromise resulting from the \ndiffering policy concepts with respect to packaging waste management and the \nensuing regulatory competition among member states. \n                                                 \n11 Before the passing of the Packaging Waste Directive, the Commission had already in the \n1980s unsuccessfully challenged the Danish bottle recycling system in the European Court of \nJustice (Case No. 302\/86). \n22 \nFirst, in addition to the mentioned minimum targets, the Directive also sets a \nmaximum target of 65% of packaging waste recovery. According to Article 6, \npara. 6, Member States can only set programmes going beyond this maximum \ntarget \u2018on condition that these measures avoid distortions of the internal market \nand do not hinder compliance by other Member States with the Directive\u2019. The \nmotivation for these provisions stems from the adverse consequences the Ger-\nman Packaging Ordinance initially had on other member states. At the very \nbeginning of its existence, the DSD did not have sufficient national capacities to \nprocess the total amount of recycled packages that it was required to recycle \naccording to the Ordinance. As a consequence, large amounts of recycled mate-\nrials, mainly paper, were dumped in other EU countries and the Far East, caus-\ning angry reactions by foreign companies, especially in France and the United \nKingdom (Biod, Probert and Jones 1994; Eden 1997, p. 234). The Commission \nfeared that retaliatory measures by other EU member states and counter-\nmeasures by Germany could potentially undermine the objective of the Single \nEuropean Market and the Directive was an attempt to contain trade frictions \namong the member states with respect to recycled materials. Maybe even more \nthan by environmental motives, the Directive was therefore triggered by con-\ncern about the smooth functioning of the internal market. Further evidence for \nthis is that the Directive is explicitly based on Article 100a of the Treaty estab-\nlishing the European Community, instead of Articles 130r to 130t. Whereas the \nlatter articles encompass the environment chapter of the Treaty, the major ob-\n23 \njective of Article 100a is the synchronisation of national legislation in order to \nremove and avoid internal barriers to trade. \nSecond, contrary to the German Product Recycling and Waste Management \nAct, on which the amended Packaging Ordinance is based upon, the EU Direc-\ntive, while paying lip service to preventing the creation of packaging waste, \ndoes not even contain a clear hierarchy of objectives and disposal methods in \nwhich the prevention of packaging waste ranks higher than recycling which in \nturn ranks higher than incineration. \nThird, and related to the last point, the Directive positively encourages the \nincineration of recovered packaging waste as an alternative to material recy-\ncling. In this respect, it follows the French model of packaging waste manage-\nment (see Biod, Probert and Jones 1994). Article 6 of the Directive again sets a \nmaximum target of 45% and a minimum target of 25% by weight of the totality \nof packaging material and a minimum target of 15% by weight of each packag-\ning material to be recycled. The rest is to be incinerated. As mentioned, the \nGerman Packaging Ordinance in contrast allows incineration for up to 40% of \nplastics only, all other recovered packaging waste needs to be recycled. A recent \nstudy by the \u00d6ko-Institut and the Deutsche Projekt Union (1999) aspires to \ndemonstrate that material recycling is ecologically superior to incineration. \nFourth, and more generally, the recovery and recycling targets set in the Di-\nrective are commonly regarded as relatively lax, hardly exceeding already \nachieved targets in the member states (Gehring 1996, p. 21). This, together with \nthe setting of maximum targets, was the main reason why countries like Ger-\n24 \nmany, Denmark and the Netherlands, which had already established more \nstringent national systems and had therefore envisaged more ambitious recov-\nery and recycling targets voted against the Directive, when it came to a quali-\nfied majority vote in the European Council of Ministers in December 1994. The \nCommission\u2019s environment directorate (DGXI) has recently put forth a draft \nwith new recycling targets which aim to increase the total target to 75% by 2006 \nwith mimum targets for each packaging material to be increased to 45% (ENDS \n1999). Whether these more ambitious targets will become reality, remains to be \nseen, however. \nTo sum up, the European Union and many of its member states have fol-\nlowed the German way of prioritising recycling over packaging waste avoid-\nance. Associations similar to DSD were set up in other member states and in \nthis respect DSD really is a prime example for a successful VA. That this success \nwill translate into substantial environmental improvements at the EU level is \nrather unlikely, however. Significant reductions in the consumption of packages \nand the accompanying resource and energy savings are not to be expected. \nWorse still, many provisions in the Directive are hardly stringent and encour-\nage incineration of waste packages at the expense of recycling. Similarly, while \nassociations in other member states resemble the DSD, very often they are faced \nwith much laxer targets for both collection and recycling of packaging waste \n(for more detail, see Brisson 1994). \n \n \n25 \nCONCLUSION \nIf DSD fulfils most conditions for a successful VA, why does this success not \ntranslate into substantial environmental improvements? The answer is that the \nvery idea of German packaging waste management is misguided. Instead of \nprioritising waste avoidance as actually demanded by \u00a74 of the Product Recy-\ncling and Waste Management Act and in spite of solemn declarations in \nSonntagsreden (cheap talk on special occasions) to the contrary, the system\u2019s fo-\ncus is on waste recycling where avoidance can at best come about as an indirect \neffect. The environmental effect is therefore inferior to what a waste manage-\nment policy with priority on avoidance could achieve: instead of the full re-\nsource and energy saving that would follow from waste avoidance, only part of \nthe embodied resources and energy can be recovered with recycling and further \nresources and energy are consumed in the process of collection, sorting and re-\ncovering. There is an important lesson here for the assessment of VAs: even the \nbest VA that fulfils all the conditions for success might achieve inferior envi-\nronmental effects if its inherent logic is misguided from an environmental per-\nspective. Most conditions for a successful VA one can find in the literature are \nprocedure-oriented. They do not pay enough attention to the contents of an \nagreement. It is simply not enough to have monitored, long-term, quantitative, \nnon-negotiable targets if the targets themselves are misguided. \nHowever, the misguided contents might in turn be the consequence of an \nimportant procedural flaw of the way the DSD was established as a VA. Bizer \nand J\u00fclich (1999, p. 62, added emphasis) conclude from an examination of sev-\n26 \neral Dutch and German VAs that \u2018participation of all legitimate and relevant \nactors in the negotiation and implementation process is likely to be positively \nrelated to higher environmental effectiveness. An early and adequate discussion \nof the environmental issues that involves all relevant parties helps to define the \nenvironmental problem and eventually the content of the agreement\u2019. If one \nregards environmental groups as legitimate and relevant actors for packaging \nwaste management, then it was exactly their involvement and impact upon the \ncontent of the agreement that was missing. From the beginning, environmental \npressure groups and the opposition Social Democratic and Green parties were \nsceptical towards the DSD\u2019s priority of recycling over avoidance, but the then \nruling Christian Democrat and Liberal parties together with the packaging in-\ndustry deliberately ignored calls for greater emphasis on waste avoidance. In \nthe DSD\u2019s board of trustees no environmental groups are represented. A con-\nsumer interest group left the board early on as it did not see its interests repre-\nsented (Rennings et al. 1996, p. 231). \nThe DSD has by now very well established itself in Germany. Many of the \ninitial problems such as insufficient and horrendously expensive facilities for \nplastics recycling or the already mentioned dumping of German recycled paper \nin other EU countries or South East Asia have now been solved. They have been \nwhat is called children\u2019s diseases (Kinderkrankheiten) in German: initial problems \nfading away after a while. The system is now in the process of realising its full \ninnovative potential with automatic sorting technologies and refined recycling \nmethods. However, this will not change its inherent logic which gives priority \n27 \nto recycling over avoidance. Indeed, the better the DSD establishes itself, the \nmore will this misguided priority lock itself in. The now ruling Social Democ-\nratic and Green parties have all but given up on any plans to reverse this prior-\nity, which provides a case in point. That many of the EU countries are following \nthe same path is good news for DSD, but bad news for environmentalists who \nwant to see substantial reductions in resource and energy use in the packaging \nsector that could only come about if the same innovative potential that is now \nbeing realised in the recycling sector was available for the avoidance of waste as \nwell. \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nI am thankful for helpful comments on earlier drafts of this paper from two \nanonymous referees, as well as from Andy Gouldson and Volrad Wollny.
