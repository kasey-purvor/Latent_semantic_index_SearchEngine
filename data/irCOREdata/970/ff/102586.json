INTRODUCTION\nT HERE are extensive works in channel investigationsthat discuss ultra-wideband (UWB) multipath clusters\nand their dependency on measurement bandwidth and the\nconsidered environment. In general, the UWB multipath cluster\nmodel is described by the classical Saleh\u2013Valenzuela (SV)\nmodel [1] and by some modifications as proposed by Chong\net al. [2] and Spencer et al. [3] where, in the latter, the com-\nbined spatio\u2013temporal statistical model for indoor multipath\npropagation was presented herein. In order to investigate UWB\nchannel modeling, its propagation paths are characterized as the\nstationary condition where the channel characteristics remain\nconstant within finite space, time, and frequency intervals.\nHowever, most of the current available UWB channel model\nsimulations imply only channel impulse responses (CIRs)\nwithout any details of obstruction clusters and distortion ef-\nfects to support realistic UWB propagation channels. Cheng\nand Dubey proposed a generic statistical channel model for a\nwideband environment [4]. This work mentioned the cluster\nclassification and frequency subbands in the simulation process.\nThe departure and arrival multipath rays were grouped into a\ncluster in which a set of angles of arrival (AOAs), angles of\ndeparture (AODs), and times of arrival (TOAs) were generated\nfor each frequency interval. This can gain UWB multipath\ncharacteristics for each considered frequency subband.\nManuscript received May 25, 2008; May 30, 2008. First published June 10,\n2008; current version published December 30, 2008.\nThe authors are with the Centre for Communication Systems Research, Uni-\nversity of Surrey, Surrey GU2 7XH, U.K. (e-mail: K.Makaratat@surrey.ac.uk).\nDigital Object Identifier 10.1109\/LAWP.2008.2001174\nEssentially, in order to investigate the realistic UWB\nspatio\u2013temporal channel statistics and the geometrically based\npulse distortion model, the proposed simulation is a combina-\ntion of simulating characteristics of UWB multipath clusters\nand physics-based pulse distortions captured by planar arrays.\nIn addition to time domain characteristics, this simulation is\nextended to include the frequency-dependent electromagnetic\nproperties of obstruction materials. The capability of generating\naccurate site-specific UWB CIRs and their realistic pulse wave-\nforms, which contain distortion, can be provided. Alternatively,\nit also gains a viable and affordable way to investigate the\nUWB CIRs with the advantage of short simulation time due\nto generating only specific dominant multipath signals. This is\nless time consuming compared with the ray-tracing technique\nin which all propagation paths are computed. Finally, UWB\nreceiving system performance is also presented to quantify\ndistortion effects. All cases of multipath channels are taken into\naccount over all frequency subbands.\nII. UWB MULTIPATH CLUSTERS AND DISTORTION\nCHANNEL IMPULSE RESPONSE\nA. Classification of UWB Multipath Clusters\nAccording to multipath cluster investigations derived from\nmany indoor UWB measurements [1]\u2013[3], [5], [6], each mul-\ntipath cluster could be identified by a group of multipath\ncomponents (MPCs). The received MPCs from dominant\npropagation paths from a transmitter to a receiver are expected\nto come from three types of radio propagation paths. The\nfirst group corresponds to scattering near the transmitter site,\nClass-I clusters. Similarly, Class-II clusters can be observed at\nthe receiver site due to the scattering objects in the neighboring\narea of the receiver. Finally, line-of-sight (LOS) components\nbetween the transmitter and the receiver are considered as\nClass-III clusters [4]. In addition to CIRs to be employed,\ndistortion characteristics are also considered for constructing\nthe realistic UWB channel model. According to UWB channel\nproperties for multipath environments, more than one mul-\ntipath ray can be observed within a short time bin [1], [7].\nThese overlapped ray arrivals can inevitably cause pulse-shape\ndistortions. As a result, the simulation technique presented in\nthis letter also includes a UWB time-domain distortion model\nbased on a geometric-optic (GO) technique to describe direct\nand reflected rays, and based on the geometric\/uniform theory\nof diffraction (GTD\/UTD) technique to describe the diffracted\nrays, including the perfectly conducting half-plane diffraction\n1536-1225\/$25.00 \u00a9 2008 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Illustration of UWB propagation clusters and distortion mechanisms.\nand propagation through d-thickness-slab obstructions [7], [8].\nThe illustration of classified UWB clusters and pulse distortion\nmechanisms is presented in Fig. 1.\nB. Physics-Based-Distorted CIR Modeling\nConsequently, in order to construct realistic UWB propa-\ngation channels, classified MPC clusters and pulse distortion\neffects are simulated together. Typically, the total response\nfrom a complex multipath channel can be modeled by the\nsummation of all impulse responses of local scattering with the\nclosed-form expression of specific geometric configurations.\nUnlike typical UWB channel models [9], this simulation relies\non combining pulse distortion characteristics into the UWB\nCIR model. In addition, this modified simulation also includes\nfrequency-dependent effects as each CIR model is considered at\neach frequency subband . For instance, in the LOS scenario of\nCase-A describing a small furnished office room, the channel\nwould be dominated by Class-III clusters and distorted by\nmultiple reflections and half-plane diffraction as defined by\n-\n-\n(1)\nNext, the NLOS scenario Case-B is considered where a\ntransmitter and a receiver are in the same office room with\na-light-wall or a-cloth-partition separation between both ends;\nthe channel would be still dominated by Class-III clusters and\ndistorted by the similar effects as Case-A. However, thin slab\ndiffraction included as an addition into the distortion model\n-\nto construct\n-\n. When propagation\npaths in a larger furnished office room NLOS Case-C are con-\nsidered, all three classes of clusters are presented. All distortion\neffects might possibly appear in Class-III similar to LOS-A, but\ndistortions due to thin-slab diffraction and thick-slab reflection\nare modeled for Class-II clusters. The CIRs of Case-C can be\ndescribed by (2) where is the single-directional\nCIR of Class-I clusters at the transmitter site. and are\nthe elevation and azimuth AOD of the MPCs\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(2)\nFinally, if a transmitter and a receiver are located in a\ndifferent furnished room or separated by a thick wall, the\nchannel would be dominated by Class-I and Class-II clusters\ncorresponding to the extreme NLOS condition (Case-D). Only\nthick-slab reflection is considered. Thus, only the last two\nterms in (2) are taken into account for this\n-\n. Since\nthis paper concentrates on novel frequency-dependent results\nobtained from the proposed simulation, all technical terms\nof\n- -\n, and\n-\nare not\nillustrated in this letter, but their formulas are written in detail\nas defined in [4], [7], and [8].\nIII. MODIFIED SPATIOTEMPORAL SIMULATION AND\nFREQUENCY-DEPENDENT RESULTS\nA. Modified Spatiotemporal Simulation\nThis section proposes a UWB pulse simulation method based\non planar array systems, a different approach than the one pro-\nposed in [4]. Moreover, this modified simulation also incorpo-\nrates the physics-based pulse distortion model by using priori-\nmodeled parameters [1]\u2013[3], [5], [6] as presented in Table I\nwith a uniform distribution, U[:,:], denoted in some parameters.\nThe entire frequency (2\u201311 GHz) is divided into ten subbands\nwith each subband occupying 1-GHz bandwidth. CIRs and dis-\ntorted pulses are generated to represent the arrival rays regarding\nUWB characteristics. The UWB transmitted pulse consists of\nthe second derivative of a Gaussian function with 1-ns pulse\nwidth. Types and numbers of dominated clusters corresponding\nto each specific scenario are also described in Table I. Parameter\nsets of , , and are used to calculate angle spread (AS)\nto determine the AOAs and AODs in azimuth and elevation an-\ngles. and are used to compute delay spread (DS) in order\nto form TOAs. The number of clusters and MPCs arriving within\neach cluster correspond to cluster and ray decay factors and\n, respectively. Accordingly, it can be possibly assumed that all\nsimulated MPCs at each frequency subband rely on UWB mul-\ntipath channel characteristics [2], [3], [5], [7].\nUsing this methodology, UWB multipath CIRs and their dis-\ntorted pulses can be generated based on specific environments.\nModeling parameters and types of distortion mechanisms in\nTable I are selected, corresponding to propagation path cases\nand related classes of clusters. The height of the transmitter and\nthe receiver is 1.325 m. The time resolution of generated sig-\nnals in this simulation is 83.32 ps with 6144 data points. Ac-\ncordingly, the maximum time delay allocating MPCs is approx-\nimately 500 ns. However, a very low level of some generated\nimpulse signals is not considered although they appear earlier\nthan 500 ns. The simulation is applied through whole ten fre-\nquency-subband received signals with 3 3 planar arrays. This\ncan lead to complex and congested results (81 values for one\nMPC). Hence, only simulating results observed by the reference\n(3, 3) antenna are presented and used to quantify distortion ef-\nfects which will be discussed in Section IV.\nB.

Comparison of total energy variations of received signals simulated for\nall frequency subbands.\nfrequency variation are also taken into account; thus, the simu-\nlation at each subband examines pulse distortions from different\ndielectric constants. The effects of frequency-dependent di-\nelectric constants of materials for individual UWB propagation\npaths are characterized and their results are shown in Fig. 2.\nTotal energies can be computed by summing up all power of\nsimulated MPCs at each frequency subband. Power in each\nMPC is normalized over the total power for each obstruction\nmaterial. It can be seen that there are frequency-selective char-\nacteristics for propagation through each material as total energy\nvariations fluctuate nearly the same in the overall subband. But\nthere is dramatic variation of total energies in NLOS Case-D\npropagation channels. This might be due to various obstructions\nalong the long distance of propagation paths which can distort\nand attenuate the simulated signal strength.\nFurthermore, when considering UWB energy distribution of\nall UWB channels distorted by various obstructions over all\nfrequency subbands, energy variation classified by distortion\nmechanisms can be determined as illustrated in Fig. 3. The\nsummation of total energies of all MPCs from all clusters\ndistorted by particular obstructions is calculated. Total energies\nfor MPCs of LOS and GO ray mechanism are less than others.\nThis is caused by the least total numbers of all LOS contri-\nbutions to be calculated although its received signal energies\nFig. 3. Frequency-dependent energy distribution of all scenario cases classified\nby types of distortion mechanism.\nare maximum when considering individual path cases. There\nare the highest normalized total energies in received signals\ndistorted by other mechanisms, such as multiple reflections,\nhalf-plane diffractions, thin-slab diffractions, and thick-slab\nreflections. Due to the large numbers of clusters and MPCs as\nindicated in Table I, energy distributions of these distortion\neffects are approximately in the same high level, especially for\nthin- and thick-slab distortions.\nIV. QUANTIFICATION OF DISTORTION EFFECTS\nON SYSTEM PERFORMANCE\nTo quantify pulse distortion impacts on UWB system perfor-\nmance, the probability of bit-error rate (BER) is also presented\nin this section. Pulse position-modulation time-hopping UWB\n(PPM\u2013TH\u2013UWB) is generated as the transmitted signal con-\nveying 3000 b through 3000 pulses, thus code repetition coding\nis not applied. The average pulse repetition period is 60 ns, guar-\nanteeing the absence of intersymbol interference (ISI) in LOS.\nThese generated signals are simulated and transmitted\nover the synthesized multipath channels as stated in Section II;\ntherefore, CIRs, , including cluster types and distortion ef-\nfects, are taken into account. An ideal RAKE receiver that pro-\ncesses all multipath contributions is simulated for the receiving\nsystem. Consequently, the probability of BER of received\nsignals can be identified by\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on May 07,2010 at 15:13:29 UTC from IEEE Xplore.

The error prob-\nability results in distorted UWB multipath channels for Case-A\nare illustrated in Fig. 4 where system performances are simu-\nlated at all frequency subbands. Comparing performances sim-\nulated all subbands, the best performance could be obtained for\nUWB multipath channels simulated over 4\u20135 GHz subbands.\nFurthermore, comparing between each scenario case can\nquantify distortion effects corresponding to cluster classifica-\ntions and propagation scenarios as depicted in Fig. 5. The best\nperformances of each case allocated in different frequency sub-\nbands are compared. Results can be confirmed that distortion ef-\nfects can degrade system performances regarding characteristics\nof propagation paths with the highest performance in Case-A\nfollowed by Case-B, Case-C, and Case-D, respectively.\nV. CONCLUSION\nThis letter presents significant results of the frequency-de-\npendent characteristics and the quantification of distortion\neffects on UWB multipath channels. The modified simula-\ntion, which extends the standard IEEE UWB CIR model with\nphysics-based distortion mechanisms suitably for specific\nscenarios and cluster types, are proposed and applied to gain\nthe results. Simulation over ten frequency subbands can lead to\nvariation of frequency-dependent normalized energy regarding\nscenario cases, cluster classification, and obstruction materials.\nReasonable investigated results are presented as the maximum\ntotal energy distribution and the highest system performance\ncan be observed in the LOS case. In contrast, propagation\nbetween rooms gains the worst results of energy distribution\nand system performance.\nREFERENCES\n[1] A. Saleh and R. A.
