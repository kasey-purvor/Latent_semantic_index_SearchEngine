Other odours arise from sources such as \nindustrial wastewaters (solvents, volatile organic compounds) or sulphurous effluents [1].  \nMany compounds have been identified in sewage works odours and include reduced \nsulphur and nitrogen compounds, organic acids, aldehydes and ketones.  The most \nsignificant of these is hydrogen sulphide (H2S) which is the most abundant odour source \nin municipal sewage works.  The formation of hydrogen sulphide arises from either the \nreduction of sulphate or the desulphurisation of organic compounds containing sulphur.   \nGas\/liquid contacting units, which have been employed for the removal of \nodourous gases through absorption, have been conventionally performed in systems such \nas packed towers, spray towers and bioscrubbers.  Such set-ups aim to provide as much \ninterfacial area as possible thorough the selection of the correct packing media or \ndispersion system.  Although high removal efficiencies in such systems are obtained, they \nare limited in performance by factors such as foaming, unloading and flooding [2,3].   \n Absorption using microporous membranes has been successfully applied for \nodorous gas removal without many of the problems associated with conventional \nsystems.  In such systems, removal occurs as the gas and liquid absorbent flow across \neither side of the membrane, with gas\/liquid mass transfer occurring at the pore mouth of \nthe membrane.  Membrane absorbers offer a number of advantages over conventional \ntechnologies, with many of the associated disadvantages being consistently diminished or \neliminated through continual research and development (Table 1).  Principal attributes of \n 3\nthe membrane system include the provision of a constant surface area for absorption, \ndecoupling of flow rates and reduced operating and maintenance costs due to the absence \nof moving parts [2].  The main disadvantage of membrane absorbers is the additional \nresistance to mass transfer imposed by the membrane which can have a detrimental effect \non the overall rate of transfer. \n Membrane contactors have been used in a variety of applications, from blood \noxygenation [4], to the absorption of a number of acid and alkaline gases such as, carbon \ndioxide, sulphur, ammonia etc into various solvents or aqueous solutions (water, soda \netc), as demonstrated by Qi and Cussler [5] and Karoor and Sirkar [3].  Commercially gas \nabsorbers are used for the carbonation\/nitrogenation of beverages in the drinks industry \n[6]. \n In the present study, a HF membrane based gas\/liquid absorption process, with the \nintention of being employed for use for contaminated gas cleanup, was investigated.  The \ntest contaminant was hydrogen sulphide and the absorbent, a dilute caustic solution.  The \naim of the current research was to derive design numbers and assess how this technology \ncould be integrated into an existing odour treatment strategy thorough comparative \nanalysis with published case studies.  Analysis of H2S removal was studied under various \nconditions such as water chemistry, inlet gas concentration and operating conditions of \nthe absorber. \n \n \n \nMass Transfer Theory of a Microporous Membrane in Non-Wetted Mode  \n \n 4\nIn this configuration, the hydrophobic membrane pores are gas filled, with liquid \nprevented from entering the membrane.  To maintain this mode, the gas pressure, Pg, has \nto be higher than that of the liquid to prevent the latter from dispersing as drops into the \ngas phase (Figure 1).  The gas liquid interface is at the pore mouth of the hydrophobic \nmembrane on the liquid side, with the diffusion of gas occurring firstly, through the gas \nfilm in the pores, and finally dissolving into the contact liquid absorbent. \n In a membrane contactor, operated under non-wetted mode, three mass transfer \nresistances present themselves in series: namely the gas, membrane and liquid phases.  If \nthe system is operated under steady state conditions, with gas and liquid equilibrium at \nthe membrane wall, the concentration profile is discontinuous at the membrane interface, \naccording to Henry\u2019s Equilibrium Law.  The mass transfer coefficient in series [7] can be \ndescribed as \n  \nillmmogiG dHkdkdkdK\n1111 ++=                                                     (i) \nwhere KG (m.s-1) is the overall mass transfer coefficient; kg (m.s-1), km (m.s-1), and kl  (m.s-\n1) are the local gas phase, membrane and liquid phase mass transfer coefficients; and do \n(m), dlm (m) and di (m) representing the outer, logarithmic mean, and inner fibre diameter.  \nH is the Henry\u2019s law constant (dimensionless). \nFrom the above equation (i), it is apparent that Henry\u2019s Law constant is a \npredominant factor in the control of the mass transfer process.  For the absorption of \ngases with low solubilities such as O2 and CO2 through a hydrophobic membrane (i), H is \nreduced and mass transfer becomes controlled by the liquid film layer with both the gas \nand membrane resistances becoming negligible.   \niliG dHkdK\n11 \u2245                       (ii) \n 5\nFor highly soluble gases, on the other hand, the liquid resistance is removed from the \noverall equation due to H being several magnitudes higher.  In this instance the overall \ntransfer equation simplifies to: \nlmmogiG dkdkdK\n111 +\u2245                      (iii) \nHydrogen sulphide absorption in NaOH solutions has also been reported as gas film \ncontrolled, and so mass transfer coefficients can be calculated from the following, as \ndescribed by Costello et al. [8] and Li et al. [9].  \n\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b=\nog\nig\nT\nG\nG C\nC\nA\nQK ln                (iv) \nwhere Qg is the gas flow rate (m3.s-1) and AT represents the transfer area (m2). Cig (ppmV) \nand Cog (ppmV), represent the inlet and outlet concentrations, respectively. \n \nMATERIAL AND METHODS \n \nExperimental Procedure for H2S absorption  \n \nThe microporous membrane gas absorber, illustrated in Figure 2, was similar in \ndesign to that described by Kong and Li [10].  The HF cartridge used in the study was \nsupplied by Intersep Ltd (UK) with the estimated membrane specifications listed in Table \n2.  The feed gas, which was a mixture of H2S in balance with synthetic air (N2 + O2), was \ntaken from 25, 500, 1000 and 2000ppmV bulk cylinders (BOC Gases, UK) and various \nconcentrations obtained by diluting with air through an additional rotameter.  The gas \nmixture was then passed through the fibre shell at the desired flow rate and a dilute caustic \n 6\nsolution was pumped counter-currently from the bottom of the shell through the fibre \nlumens.  \n When the contact solvent was used at pH 7, samples were taken directly into 25 ml \nbottles for sulphate analysis at a later date through spectrophotometry using a wet \nchemical method (HACH Method 8131, HACH Ltd, 1998).  When using the contact \nsolvent at pH 13 (10% NaOH), samples were taken and stored with an anti-oxidant \nsolution (Standards Methods 4500 S2-.G) with the purpose of inhibiting the oxidation of \nsulphide and to provide a constant ionic strength solution. Sulphide measurements were \nobtained using an ion probe and sulphorous compounds measurements checked through \natomic absorption.  Obtained experimental data was compared to theoretical values which \nwere found by determining the mass balance through the system.   \n \nDetermining Outlet Gas Concentraions \n \n Outlet gas concentrations were measured using a gas data logger (Odalog, \nAustralia), which had a range of 1 to 200 ppmV H2S.  The instrument was calibrated prior \nto each run against a concentration of 25 ppmV or 170 ppmV, depending on the gas flow \nconcentration used for that particular experiment. \n \n \n \n \n \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n 7\nH2S Absorption   \n \nAfter establishing equilibrium, which was found to occur within five minutes, gas \nphase data showed that the removal efficiency of H2S, upon a single pass through the \nmembrane unit, to be strongly dependent on the liquid contactor pH.  At a pH of 7.5, \nremoval efficiency was found to decrease in a linear fashion as a function of gas to liquid \n(G:L) ratio, with a gradient of -2.06 and a regression coefficient of 0.66, illustrated in \nFigure 3. An example of this relationship, can be seen when the G:L ratio was increased \nfrom 1 to 21 there was a corresponding decrease in removal efficiency, from 95 to 56%, \nrespectively.  In contrast to this finding, at a contact solvent pH of 13, removal efficiency \nremained at a constant level of over 97% for G:L ratios between 1 and 50.  It is these \ncontrasting findings that demonstrate the impact of altering the alkalinity of the contact \nliquid on H2S removal. The function of pH on removal performance (v) is due to the fact \nthat H2S is a weak dibasic acid which dissociates in water [11].  \n\u2212+=\u2212+= +\u21d4+\u21d4 289.1204.72\n21\nSHHSHSH\naa pKpH\n             (v) \nEstimates of pKa2 are in the range of approximately 12.2-17.1 at 25oC [12]  with the latest \nestimates tending to be higher in value [12]. \n At a neutral pH, approximately 50% of the total H2S is present in it\u2019s molecular \nform and it is in this state that odour problems occur [14]. Above pH 7, the majority of \nsulphide is present in ionic form, as either HS- or S2-.  If pH is increased further, to pH \n13, a second passover occurs and approximately 50% of the sulphide present is in each \nionic form.  Sulphide may also be oxidised to form elemental sulphur, sulphite, \nthiosulphate or sulphate.  Data presented by Birkner and O\u2019Brien [15] suggested that pH \nand sulphide\/oxygen rations were significant factors in determining oxidisation reaction \n 8\nproducts.  In the case where sulphide\/oxygen ratios are high, elemental sulphur was \nreported to be formed.  At lower pHs and lower sulphide\/oxygen ratios, however, \nsulphate tended to be formed, whilst under alkaline conditions sulphite, thiosulphate and \nsulphate were produced.  The researchers suggested that this was related to the \ndissociation products, i.e. dissolved H2S or HS-.  Buisman et al. [16] found sulphide \nconcentration to have similar effects on the formation of certain dissociation products.  At \nhigh sulphide concentrations elemental sulphur was dominant, whereas at lower sulphide \nconcentrations sulphite, thiosulphate and sulphate were observed as reaction products.  At \nlower pHs the reaction only tends to elemental sulphur, with the process occurring at a \nvery slow rate in the absence of a catalyst.  Liquid phase data obtained in the present \nstudy revealed that all the absorbed H2S existed in either S2- form or the sulphate form \nindicating that the reaction was occurring at the gas\/liquid interface at pH 13 and pH 7, \nrespectively. These findings were in agreement with results published by Qi and Cussler \n[5], who found that the reaction of H2S in a caustic solution to be almost instantaneous, \nthus negating the liquid side resistance to mass transfer.   \nAfter a single pass of H2S through the membrane module, the residual gas \nconcentration, under an operating pH of 7.5, Cgo (ppmV), showed a logarithmic trend \nwith respect to the liquid flow rate (ml.min-1), in the form:   \nCgo = aLn(QL) + b             (vi) \nWhere a (min.m-3) and b (m-3) are constants. It was discovered that the value of exponent \na decreased in a linear relationship (R2 = 0.96), from -4.9 to -2.1, as the rate of the inlet \ngas flow was varied between 1200 and 850 mL.min-1, respectively. From this it was \nobvious that the process of absorption in the membrane unit was more sensitive to liquid \nflow rate at higher gas flows (Table 3).  An example of this relationship between liquid \n 9\nand gas flow rate can be seen when operating at a gas flow rate of 1200 mL.min-1.  In this \ninstance the outlet gas concentration decreased from 17 to 4 ppmV as the liquid flow rate \nincreased from 50 to 650 mL.min-1.  Alternatively, when the gas flow rate was set at 850 \nmL.min-1, the effluent gas concentration decreased from 7 to 1 ppmV over the same \nrange of liquid flow rates (Figure 4). \n \nMass Transport Analysis \n \nOverall mass transfer coefficients were calculated as both a function of gas and \nliquid flow rates at pHs between 7.5 and 13.  The mass transfer coefficient ranged \nbetween 0.17x10-4 and 4.07x10-4, at a pH of 7.5, across a liquid velocity range of 0.003 to \n0.04 m.s-1 (Figure 5).  The relationship between KG and liquid velocity showed either a \nslight increase or no overall change as a function of liquid velocity (Table 4).  \nExperimental data produced mean KG ranges from 0.72 to 3.45x10-4 m.s-1 as the gas flow \nrate was increased from 850 to 5000 mL.min-1, respectively, showing a greater \ndependency on the gas flow rate in the system.  Similar observations were made when the \npH was altered to 13, with no change in KG occurring by varying liquid phase velocities \nbetween 0.006 and 0.034 m.s-1.  The magnitude of  KG varied as a function of both the gas \nflow rate and the inlet gas concentration, within the limits of 1.46x10-4 and 25.4x10-4  \nm.s-1, at corresponding gas phase concentrations of 600, 524 and 5000 and 2010   \nmL.min-1, respectively (Figure 6).  From these findings, no direct correlation could be \nfound by combining the two parameters in the form of inlet mass loading rate. \nIn contrast to the findings mentioned previously, KG exhibited a linear \nrelationship with gas velocity under all experimental conditions.  Figure 7 shows that at \n 10\npH 13, an increase in the gas phase velocity from 0.008 to 0.067 m.s-1 resulted in the \nsubsequent increase in KG values from 1.5x10-4 to 25.4x10-4 m.s-1.  By reducing the pH to \n7.5, at the same gas velocity range, the effect on KG was much smaller, with values \nranging from 1x10-4 to 4x10-4 m.s-1.  In order to examine the relative effects of the \ndifferent operating variables the linear gradient and the overall mass transfer coefficients \nwere compared (Table 4).  It can be seen that the greatest influence on mass transfer was \nthe gas velocity of the H2S and the pH of the contact liquid absorbent.  The variation in \nlinear gradient of KG, as a function of gas velocity, varied between 0.005 and 0.002 at pH \n7.5, compared to an average experimental value of 0.037 at pH 13 (Figure 8).  An order \nof magnitude difference in the overall mass transfer coefficient was observed, as a \nfunction of pH, at higher gas velocities when compared to those values obtained at lower \npHs. \nExperimental KG values reported in this study, ranging from 1.46x10-4 and \n25.4x10-4 m.s-1, are similar to values cited in the literature for H2S absorption systems.  \nKreulen et al. [17], found the overall mass transfer coefficient to vary between 25x10-4 \nfor H2S mixed with N2O, to 0.02x10-4 for pure H2S, with the latter value showing \nabsorption in that system to be controlled by the liquid phase, producing a lower overall \ntransfer coefficient.  Similar mass transfer coefficients were also reported by Li et al. [9], \nwith ranges between 1x10-4 and 90x10-4, for H2S absorption into a 10% NaOH contact \nsolution with the gas flowing in the lumen side of the membrane. \nAs mentioned previously, low solubility gases such as H2S, CO2 and SO2 would \nbe expected to be liquid phase controlled due to the species greater affinity for the gas \nphase (i.e. small H).  This theory was confirmed experimentally by Karoor and Sirkar [3], \nwith the absorption of CO2 and SO2 into water.  However, work carried out by Yang and \n 11\nCussler [18] and Qi and Cussler [5] on CO2 and H2S, respectively showed that a chemical \nreaction takes place at the gas\/liquid interface, depending on the nature of solvent used, \nwith the effect of negating the liquid side resistance to mass transfer. \n \nMembrane Resistance \n \nBy determining the individual mass transfer coefficient for the membrane, km \n[9,17] and comparing it to the overall coefficient (iii), the relative impact of the \nmembrane and gas boundary layer resistances were evaluated.  The membrane transfer \ncoefficient of 0.14 m.s-1 was calculated from the membrane data supplied by the \nmanufacturer: porosity of 40% and a thickness of 15 \u00b5m.  The tortuosity of the pores was \nestimated from values cited in the literature [18] and the thickness of the membrane was \nassumed to impart a resistance.  Experimental values of km ranged from 2.27x10-3 to \n2.63x10-3 m.s-1, as determined from a classical Wilson plot with a velocity exponent of \none (Figure 9).  A similar difference in calculated and experimentally obtained membrane \ncoefficient values were also noted by Li et al. [9], proposing that this was due to the \npartial wetting of the membrane pores and the possibility that the membrane substrates \ncontributed towards a significant resistance. Comparable experimental data for the \nmembrane transfer coefficient were also in accordance to results published by Qi and \nCussler [5], using a polypropylene membrane (7.3x10-3 m.s-1).  They too found higher \nexperimental values for polysulfone membranes (0.0123 \u2013 0.025 m.s-1) and lower values \nfor polyethersulfone membranes (5x10-4 m.s-1), demonstrating the importance of \nmembrane material selection as regards membrane resistance on the absorption process \n[9].  In the current study, the porosity of the polysulfone membrane was considerably \n 12\nlower than that for the polypropylene membrane, but still produced a transfer coefficient \nwhich was an order of magnitude higher than the latter. \nIt was determined that the individual gas transfer coefficient (kg) contributed up to \n93% of the total resistance.  The percentage influence of kg was found to decrease to the \nextent of 62% when gas velocity was increased, indicating a reduction in the thickness of \nthe boundary layer as velocity increased. Beyond a velocity of 0.026 m.s-1 no further \nchange in the contribution of kg was noted which was in accordance with findings \npublished by Li et al. [9], who reported no change in the overall transfer coefficient as \nfunction of gas velocity up to values of 5 m.s-1.  The membrane used by Li et al. [9] was \nreported to have the controlling resistance with regard to the mass transfer in the system \ndue to the low effective porosity of the membrane material (0.017).  The membrane in the \ncurrent study operated at a much lower range of gas velocities (0.005 \u2013 0.07 m.s-1), which \nwas up to two orders of magnitude lower than the work presented by Li et al.[9],  and had \na much higher porosity (0.4).  This insensitivity to gas velocity in Li\u2019s study is likely to \nbe due to the gas phase boundary layer being reduced to a minimum, even at the lowest \ninvestigated velocities. \n \nIndustrial Case Study \n \nMAS design data, as determined through the current investigation, was compared \nto existing site information from a series of UK odour treatment sites all of which were \ndesigned by the same company, at confidential locations throughout the UK.  Site \ninclusion was limited to locations with sufficient data for comparison. In total 12 sites \ncomprising of: 10 biofilters, 1 catalytic iron filter and 1 adsorption filter were included \n 13\n(Table 5). The available information was restricted to flow rate, inlet and outlet \nconcentration, and capital cost. In particular, no operating cost data was available \nrestricting the comparison to capital costs rather than whole life costs. Whilst the latter is \nthe preferred option the lack of available data reflects that in practice capital cost is often \nthe over riding decision factor in selection of ostensibly bolt on technology solutions. \nRemoval efficiencies of H2S varied from 93 to 98% across the sites, with plants treating \ngas flows up to 12112 m3.h-1, at gas concentrations of between 6.5 and 59 ppmV, \nproducing a residual concentration as low as 0.4 ppmV (Table 5).    \n \nA simplified economic assessment was performed to take into account the paucity of data \nand was restricted to a comparison with the capital cost data from the biofilters sites. The \napproach followed traditional methods whereby the cost of the membrane plant was \ndetermined in relation to the cost of the membrane material, per unit area, and an \nappropriate Lang factor (LF) to adjust to total plant capital cost [19]. The product of the \ntwo components generates a cost factor (CF) which represents the total price per unit \nmembrane area for the whole plant and was et to obtain economic parity with the existing \nbiofilters cost. \nA\nbiofilteroftxLFmCF cos\/\u00a3 2 ==            (7) \nActual hollow fibre membrane costs can vary but normally remain within the range \u00a330-\n50.m2, based on UK location in 2001 . Lang factors for membrane plants of this type are \nreported in the literature to vary between 1.66 and 2 and combining the two ranges \ngenerates a likely range for the cost factor for a membrane absorber plant which lies \nbetween 50 and 100 [20]. The membrane option was assessed to be economically \nfavorable when the available cost factor fell below this level.   \n 14\n The gas flow rate range needed to achieve economic parity, due the variability of \nthe actual cost factors, is between 580 and 3752 m3.h-1, and this reflects the importance of \nmembrane cost on the overall economics of the MAS. For a typical membrane costs of \n\u00a340.m-2 parity occurs at a gas flow rate of 1630 m3.h-1 and indicates that technologies \nsuch as the membrane absorber are more likely to be cost competitive at low to medium \nflow rates. The differences with flow rate reflect the respective economy of scales \nbetween the two technologies. Membrane systems are modular and hence exhibit an \neconomy of scale exponent of nearly one, generating a linear cost with flow rate function.  \nHowever, biofilters exhibit a more classical 0.66 exponent reflecting the ratio of area to \nvolume increase that occurs in such systems.  \n \nCONCLUSION \n \n Experiments conducted with the HF membrane absorber have demonstrated that \nthis technology can effectively remove H2S, with efficiencies of 96% at a pH of 13, at \nG:L ratios up to 50 and inlet concentrations of up to 2000 ppmV.  From this study is was \nalso discovered that the transfer of H2S into a dilute caustic solution was gas phase \ncontrolled.  The overall mass transfer coefficient of the absorption process was found to \nvary between 1 m.s-1 and 25x10-4 m.s-1.  The overall mass transfer coefficient was found \nto vary as a linear function of gas velocity, but was insensitive to liquid velocity or inlet \ngas concentration.  With respect to comparing the economics of this membrane system \nfor odour removal, economic parity with a biofiltration plant was determined at gas flow \nrates between 580 and 3752 m3.h-1, with these values being ultimately dependent on the \nprocurement cost of the membrane. \n 15\n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \n \nThe authors would like to gratefully acknowledge the support and financial \nassistance of Montgomery Watson Harza.
