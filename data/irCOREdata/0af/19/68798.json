INTRODUCTION\nAs consumer demand for products that keep getting\nsmaller, lighter and offer more functionality and perfor-\nmance for less power continues unabated, experimen-\ntal electronic system implementation technologies are\nmigrating towards 3-D solutions [1]. However, even as\ndesigners are presented with an extra spatial dimension,\nthe complexity of the layout and the architectural trade-\noffs also increase. To get a true improvement in perfor-\nmance, a very careful analysis using detailed models at\ndifferent hierarchical levels is crucial. Even though several\nprevious works have addressed this issue [2][3][4], they\nmostly concentrate on isolated model development, or\ntarget some specific type of system. In this work, we\ncollate existing models from the literature, and modify\nthem and also derive new models as necessary. The\nmain contribution of this paper is in developing a generic\nmethodology for performance and cost estimations of\n3D systems that can be modified for different applica-\ntions, and a comprehensive set of estimation models as\nbuilding blocks. We also use this methodology to provide\ndetailed estimates for two applications that showcase the\npotential benefits of 3D integration.\nPrevious works that addressed cost and performance\ntrade-offs include [2] and [3], where Liu et. al. discuss the\nmapping from 2-D to 3-D under the constraints of perfor-\nmance, cost and temperature. However, they omit many\n3-D technological details. The authors of [4] describe a\nyield and cost model for 3-D stacked chips with particular\nemphasis on how the yield is affected by the number of\nthrough-hold vias.\n3-D integration techniques can be basically catego-\nrized into two major schemes: Folding and Stacking. In\nfolding, a planar assembly with flexible substrate is folded\ninto several layers in order to form a very compact shape.\nIn this approach the interconnect length is longer than\nin the stacked approach described below, but a very\ncompact size can be achieved. Stacking can be done\nat the chip level with either chip-to-chip (C2C), Package-\non-Package (PoP) or MCM-to-MCM bonding using epoxy\nor glues and creating electrical connections by wire-\nbonding techniques. As an alternative to chip stacking,\n3-D integration can be performed at the wafer-level too.\nDifferent blocks can be processed on separate wafers,\nand they can be interconnected vertically using through-\nhole vias (THV) or through-Si vias (TSV) to form global\ncommunication links. Wafer-Level integration (WLI) can\nbe performed in two ways; entire wafers can be bonded\ntogether before dicing (an approach herein after termed\n3D-W2W) or KGDs are bonded on top of a host wafer\ncontaining other KGD sites termed (3D-D2W) [5].\nIn this analysis, we concentrate on stacking method-\nologies and compare between 3D-SiP, 3D-D2W and 3D-\nW2W technologies.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows; first,\nwe present our methodology for cost and performance\nestimation, including all models; and then in Section III,\nwe discuss the cost and performance issues for two\ndifferent applications in detail. We end with a discussion\nand our conclusions.\nII. COST AND PERFORMANCE ESTIMATION MODELS\nA. Yield and Cost Analysis\nThe yield of a bare silicon die, Ydie, depends on\nelectrical defects on each mask layer in the fabrication\nprocess and the total area of the chip. As given by [6], a\nyield function for a bare silicon die is:\nYdie =\n1\n(1 + SD0A)\nN\nS\n(1)\nwhere D0 is the average electrical defect density, S is\nthe shape factor of (what is assumed to be) the Gamma\n187\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library. Downloaded on November 30, 2009 at 09:19 from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \ndistribution of electrical defect density, N is the number\nof mask layers, and A is the chip area. If not provided by\nthe IP vendor the area of a digital module implemented\nin some target technology can be estimated in a straight-\nforward manner, using gate information and technology\nscaling. However, the area of an analog chip depends\nnot only on the number of transistors and their sizes (in\npractice, minimum size transistors are not used in analog\ncircuits), but also the circuit architecture.\nThe core area (Acore) occupying the transistors and\ntheir interconnects can either be interconnect-capacity\nlimited or transistor-area limited.\nAcore = max\n{\nNgd\n2\ng, NgAg\n}\n, (2)\nwhere Ng is the number of total number of gates, Ag\nis the gate area (Ag), and dg is the gate dimension.\nThe gate dimension is defined as dg =\nfgRmPw\newnw\n, where\nRm is the average interconnect length, which can be\ndetermined from Donath\u2019s model [7]. When it comes to\npackaging the core, the number of I\/Os to be connected\nto the outside must be arranged around the periphery\nand may require a larger perimeter than dictated by the\ncore area in order to facilitate their placement according\nto the minimum peripheral pitch. Then, the die area is:\nAdie = max\n{\n(\n\u221a\nAcore + 2Pp)2,\n(\nNpPp\n4\n+ 2Pp\n)2}\n(3)\nwhere Pp is the peripheral in-line pad pitch and Np is the\ntotal number of IO pads.\nWhen Ndie is the number of dies that can be processed\nfrom a wafer, the bare-die cost is estimated as follows:\nC1 =\nCwafer(raw, process,mask)\nNdieYdieAdie\n(4)\nThe yield after each testing process depends on the\nfault coverage level (Fc) of the testing process, and is\nY\n(1\u2212Fc)\nd . The cumulative cost per die at the end of each\nprocess step as follows [8]:\nC1,i =\nC1,i\u22121 + Ci\nY Fcd\n(5)\nwhere C1,i\u22121 is the accumulated cost of all the steps up\nto but not including the present step and Ci, is the cost\nof the present step.\nThe package type is assumed to be a peripheral I\/O\nsingle chip plastic package and its cost is calculated\nusing a price vs pin count assumption as in [9].\nB. Interconnect Performance Models\n1) On-Chip Wire Delay: Typically the delay over a\nglobal on-chip wire is RC dominated. The delay with a\ncapacitive load,CL, connected at the far-end constitutes\nthe driver delay and the distributed wire delay:\ntrc = 0.693 {Rd(Cd + cwL+ CL) + rwLCL}+0.377rwcwL2,\n(6)\nRw, Cw\nCL\nDriver\n(a) Intra chip wire model\nLbndLbnd\nCpad Cbnd\nCbnd + Cpad CL\nTL\nDriver\n(b) Inter chip wire model\nFig. 1.

There-\nfore the propagation delay on the on-chip wire, as shown\nin Figure 1(a), is the sum of cascaded buffer delay (tdrv)\nand the Elmore delay of the RC wire: tintra = tdrv + trc.\n2) Off-Chip Wire Delay: For the inter-chip commu-\nnication link shown in Figure 1(b) the following delay\nexpression can be derived[10]:\ntRLC = (t1.6tof + t\n1.6\nrc )\n1\n1.6 (7)\nwhere,\ntLC = ttof = L\n\u221a\nlwcw (8)\nand\ntrc = 0.693\n[\nZ0(Cd + Cpad + Cbnd + 0.5CL) +\nLbnd\nZ0\n+rwL(Cpad + Cbnd + CL)] + 0.4rwcwL2, (9)\nwhere Cpad is capacitance of the pad, and Cbnd and Lbnd\nare the capacitance and the inductance of the bond wire.\nFinally, the total delay for the inter-chip communication\nlink is the summation of cascaded driver delay (tdrv) and\nthe RLC-wire delay (tRLC): tinter = tdrv + tRLC .\nIII. TRADEOFF ANALYSIS FOR THE CASE STUDIES\nTo make the comparison, we begin by selecting two\nmixed-signal systems. first system is a Wireless Sensor,\nwhich contain a 2Mb DRAM, and an ASIC and Micro-\nprocessor with gate count of 500k and 300k respectively.\nIt also contains an Analog\/RF block occupying an area\nof 2 mm2. Finally , it contains a MEMS sensor with\nan area of 1mm2. The second system is a 3G mobile\nterminal. We consider a similar architecture as the first\n188\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library. Downloaded on November 30, 2009 at 09:19 from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \none but with a larger memory of 128 Mb DRAM, and\na CMOS image sensor with a pixel size of 1.75 \u00b5m \u00d7\n1.75 \u00b5m, and resolution of 8 Megapixel [11]. Further, in\nthe analysis, we consider the ASIC and Microprocessor\ntogether as a single logic block. For all the integration\nschemes, the underlying manufacturing process is a 65\nnm, 11-metal, CMOS process with a wafer diameter of\n300 mm and a lower-level wire pitch of 136 nm. We\nalso assume peripheral in-line pad arrangement and wire\nbond packaging. The worst-case delay for 2-D systems is\nestimated diagonally from chip edge to chip edge, while\nit is estimated from one edge of the bottom chip to the\nopposite side edge of the top most chip for 3-D systems.\nBased on the manufacturers data, the power density\nfor the constituent sub-modules in our case studies can\nbe estimated. The power density for a DRAM is esti-\nmated to be 0.02W\/mm2 [12], and for a logic block,\n0.12W\/mm2[13]. A CMOS Image sensor has an average\npower density of 0.016W\/mm2. The power dissipation of\nthe MEMS sensor is assumed to be 50mW , and that for\nthe Analog\/RF block, 500mW .\nFor the stacked arrangement, we assume that the\nlogic block is close to the heat sink and other blocks\nare in the following order: DRAM, Analog\/RF block, and\nMEMS\/CMOS Image sensor.\nA. Monolithic SoC\nThe integration mixed signal systems in a single die\nis a merging of several technologies, such as logic,\nmemory, analog\/RF, and this results in increased process\ncomplexity and a area change. For example merging logic\ncircuits with memory results in a lower circuit density\nand hence a larger circuit area, than their logic-only or\nmemory-only counter parts. The area of a single chip\nimplementation is estimated as stipulated in [2]. The total\ncost for an SoC implementation is given in (38).\nB. 2D-SoP\nIn the 2D-SoP implementation, we assume that four\nchips (DRAM, RF, Logic and MEMS\/Image Sensor) are\nassembled as a multi chip module (MCM). Hence, the\ncost of implementing the MCM includes the total cost\nfor each chip including the testing, the assembly cost,\nthe substrate cost, the rework cost, and finally the MCM\ntest cost and packaging cost. The SoP can provide some\nreworking capability whereas SoC and wafer-level 3-D\nintegration do not. If one rework cycle is assumed for SoP,\nthe yield in assembly is improved from Ya to (2\u2212 Ya)Ya.\nThen the cost for SoP is given by (39) and the overall\nyield is:\nYSoP = Y\n(1\u2212Fc)\nrf Y\n(1\u2212Fc)\ndram Y\n(1\u2212Fc)\nlogic Y\n(1\u2212Fc)\nother Ya (42)\nC. 3D-SiP\nA 3D-SiP implementation is similar to the SoP package\nintegration, except that the SiP implementation integrate\ndies on top of each other vertically. The cost formula\nis the same, but the MCM substrate area is reduced,\ncompared to the 2D-SoP implementation.\nD. 3D-WLP\nThe yield of each 3D-implementation method is the\ncummulative yield over all the layers (m) and given by\n[14]:\nY3D = Y2D\nm\u22121\u220f\ni=1\nY2DiYa (43)\nwhere Y2D is the yield of 2D process (fabrication yield),\nand Ya is the yield loss due to the 3D-assembling pro-\ncess. In the case of D2W stacking, die yield after the\nKGD testing should be considered. So, the overall yield\nfor implementing our target system in 3D-W2W and 3D-\nD2W methods are as follows [14]:\nY3D w2w = YdramYlogicYrfYotherY 3a (44)\nY3D D2w = Y\n(1\u2212Fc)\ndram Y\n(1\u2212Fc)\nlogic Y\n(1\u2212Fc)\nrf Y\n(1\u2212Fc)\nother Y\n3\na (45)\nThe total cost for 3-D Wafer-Level integration are given\nin equations (40) and (41). Due to the limitations in the\nwafer level processing, there is no possibility of rework-\ning.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nResults for our case studies are shown in Table II. It is\nquite obvious that 3-D integration provides very compact\ndesigns compared to its 2-D planar counterpart. Except\nfor the 3D-SiP method, 3D-WLI has lower interconnect\ndelays over the 2-D implementations. 3D-SiP and 2D-\nSoP implementations are more or less equal in imple-\nmentation cost, but 3D-SiP has a lower interconnect\ndelay. Where the wireless sensor node is concerned, the\nSoC solution is the better choice, while wafer-level 3D\nintegration provides lower area and higher performance.\nA SoC solution is the best option for such low memory ap-\nplications because it is less expensive. However, though\nquite expensive, for high performance systems, 3D-WLI\nis the best choice.\nThe scenario is different when it comes to a mobile\nterminal. In this case, the overall chip area is 4.25 times\nlarger than that of the wireless sensor node. 3D-WLI\ntechnologies outperform SiP implementation technolo-\ngies, due to the very long RC wires. Also, single chip\nsolution has a very low yield. All the other implementa-\ntions methods show a lower cost than the single chip\nimplementation. 3D-SiP seems to be the best design\nchoice for low-cost, and high performance in this case.\nThe case studies show that when the system size\nbecomes very small the thermal resistance becomes high\nthe temperature rise in the top-most chip is unbearable.\nHence, extra cooling solutions such as thermal-vias oc-\ncupying some area, or very thin layers have to be used\nin the system implementation.\n189\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we developed a detailed yield and\nquantitative cost models, and a quantitative performance\nmetric for 3-D integration. Further, we derived simple yet\nuseful thermal models for 2-D and 3-D integrated circuits.\nThe overall methodology is suitable for early analysis\nin system explorations for future nanoscale electronic\nsystems. Through some example contemporary mixed\nsignal systems we demonstrate the methodology outlined\nfor different implementations and conclude that the imple-\nmentation strategy must be carefully selected depending\non the circuit complexity, as else the move to 3-D may\nhave a detrimental effect. Design choice early in the\ndesign cycle will have a significant impact throughout the\ndesign and production lifecycles , and the models and\nmethodology presented in this article can be an important\naid in this choice.\nREFERENCES\n[1] The International Technology Roadmap for Semiconduc-\ntors(ITRS), 2005.
