With the\ngeneralized use of ultrasound examinations\nin many countries, gestational age is often\ndefined or corrected from the ultrasound\nmeasurements performed during or imme-\ndiately after the first trimester of pregnancy,\nwhich are compared to a reference growth\ncurve. As an illustration, in a cohort study\ninvestigating the association between expo-\nsure to perfluorinated chemicals and fetal\ngrowth, Fei et al. (2007) defined gestational\nage from ultrasound measures performed\nbefore 24 gestational weeks and, if this\ninformation was missing, from the date of\nthe last menstrual period (LMP). \nThe superiority of ultrasound measure-\nments over other approaches to predict the\ndate of delivery (Lynch and Zhang 2007)\ndoes not imply that ultrasound-based gesta-\ntional age leads to an unbiased estimate of\nthe effect of environmental factors on fetal\ngrowth. The use of ultrasound-based gesta-\ntional age assumes that fetal ultrasound\nmeasurements at a given gestational week\nduring the first trimester have very little vari-\nability. However, there is some evidence to\nthe contrary (Bukowski et al. 2007). Part of\nthis variability might be due to exposure to\nenvironmental pollutants. If the environ-\nmental pollutant considered can restrict fetal\ngrowth as early as the first trimester, correct-\ning gestational age using first-trimester ultra-\nsound measurements will erroneously\nshorten the gestational age of these small-for-\ngestational-age fetuses. This may lead to\nunderestimating effects of environmental\npollutants on birth weight or size controlled\nfor gestational age (Figure 1), compared with\nstudies using an accurately estimated date of\nconception. In practice, an accurate estimate\nof conception date may seldom be available\noutside the setting of in vitro fertilization. An\nalternative is reliance on LMP-based esti-\nmates, which are prone to errors due to bad\nrecall, variability in the duration of the follic-\nular phase of the cycle and midcycle, and\nearly pregnancy bleeding (Lynch and Zhang\n2007). Moreover, using the LMP-based esti-\nmate of gestational age would be problematic\nif, as already reported for specific environ-\nmental pollutants (Windham et al. 2003),\nthe environmental factors considered could\ninfluence the duration of the menstrual\ncycle. Therefore, detailed studies may be\nneeded to determine the balance between the\npossible biases in the estimated effect of the\nenvironmental factor entailed by the use of\nultrasound-based measurements and LMP-\nbased estimates.\nThis potential bias has been recognized\nby Savitz et al. (2002) and was alluded to\nby Fei et al. (2007) in their \u201cDiscussion.\u201d\nHowever, its consequences have probably\nnot been fully acknowledged. When possi-\nble, researchers should conduct sensitivity\nanalyses using different measures of gesta-\ntional age to help quantify the potential for\nbias. The same approach could also be used\nwhen gestational duration is the studied\noutcome (Lynch and Zhang 2007).\nThe authors declare they have no competing\nfinancial interests.\nR\u00e9my Slama \nAvenir Team \u201cEnvironmental Epidemiology\nApplied to Fecundity and Reproduction\u201d\nINSERM U823\nGrenoble, France\nE-mail: remy.slama@ujf-grenoble.fr\nBabak Khoshnood \nMonique Kaminski\nEpidemiological Research Unit on\nPerinatal and Women\u2019s Health\nINSERM UMR S149, IFR 69\nVillejuif, France\nREFERENCES\nBukowski R, Smith GC, Malone FD, Ball RH, Nyberg DA,\nComstock CH, et al. 2007.

Any estimate\nof gestational age is prone to misclassifica-\ntion, whether it is based on ultrasound or\nlast menstrual period (LMP). Ultrasound\nmeasures are based on the assumption of\nuniform early fetal growth or at least that\nthe exposure under study has no impact on\nearly fetal growth. This assumption is prob-\nably not always correct, as first demon-\nstrated by Henriksen et al. (1995). LMP\nestimates are prone to large random mea-\nsurement errors that may become non-\nrandom if the exposures under study affects\nmenstrual bleeding patterns. \nAlthough these problems are part of\ntextbook knowledge (Olsen and Basso\n2007), their impact appears to be limited in\nour experience. In our study (Fei et al.\n2007), the analyses based primarily on LMP\nestimates provided a regression coefficient of\n\u201310.35 [95% confidential interval (CI),\n\u201320.6 to \u20130.15] between perfluorooctanoate\nand birth weight, compared with the regres-\nsion coefficient of \u201310.63 (95% CI, \u201320.79\nto \u20130.47) we presented in the article after\nadjustment for ultrasound-based gestational\nage. The reason is probably that large ran-\ndom errors of gestational age affect estimates\nmuch more than smaller systematic errors.\nFurthermore, perfluorinated chemicals may\nnot impair early fetal growth.\nBirth weight is a function of fetal\ngrowth and the duration of the pregnancy,\nbut until better estimates become available,\nwe must use these imprecise measures of\ngestational age to determine the duration of\npregnancy. If the exposure under study\nslows early fetal growth, adjustment for ges-\ntational age based on ultrasound may\nunderestimate an effect of the exposure on\nA 284 VOLUME 116 | NUMBER 7 | July 2008 \u2022 Environmental Health Perspectives\nPerspectives | Correspondence\nThe correspondence section is a public forum and, as such, is not peer-reviewed.

(2004). We (Singer et al.\n2007) presented the flow of the LC as\n1,223,424 m3\/day, serving a population of\n5,861,200, thereby providing 0.2 m3\/per-\nson\/day of available dilution. These values\nwere used to determine the predicted\nenvironmental concentration of oseltamivir\ncarboxylate (OC), the active antiviral\nmetabolite of the prodrug oseltamivir phos-\nphate (Tamiflu), in the river during an\ninfluenza pandemic. \nUnlike the other rivers investigated in the\nstudy, the mouth of the LC is in Mexico.\nOwing to its legal requirement as per Article\n15 of the U.S.\u2013Mexican Water Treaty (U.S.\nGovernment 1944), the United States\nreleases 1,850,234,000 m3\/year of the\nColorado River to Mexico (Matuska 2007;\nU.S. Government 1944). This flow equates\nto 5,069,134 m3\/day, which is roughly\n5-fold higher than the values used in our pre-\nvious study (Singer et al. 2007). Hence, the\npredicted environmental concentration of\nOC in the LC was considerably over-\nestimated. \nDetailed characterization of pollution\nrisks in the LC is particularly challenging\nbecause of a) the arid environment and high\nevaporation; b) water conservation efforts\nlending many rivers to run dry; and\nc) numerous diversions for irrigation and\ndomestic use. A survey of the rivers that join\nthe LC indicate few, if any, significant\ninflows into the LC from major metropoli-\ntan areas downstream of Las Vegas (USGS\n2008). Notably, the only other major city\nthat might feed into the LC is Phoenix,\nwhich discharges into the Gila River. The\ndaily mean discharge of the Gila River where\nit joins the LC is 464.8 m3\/day (in 2007),\nthereby augmenting the LC flow by < 10%\n(USGS 2008). Hence, risk characterization\nof this catchment was focused on the sewage\ndischarge from Las Vegas to the LC.\nLas Vegas lies within Clark County,\nNevada, and has a population of 1,996,542\n(Clark County Department of Comprehen-\nsive Planning 2007). Wastewater treatment\nplants from Clark County produce approxi-\nmately 757,000 m3\/day, which is consistent\nwith a population of 2,102,777, assuming\n360 L\/person\/day, as is consistent for U.S.\nwater usage patterns [Water Services\nRegulation Authority (OFWAT) 2007].\nThe wastewater is discharged into the Las\nVegas Wash, a reach of Boulder Basin con-\ntaining Lake Mead; Lake Mead has a storage\ncapability of 17,500,000,000 m3 of water\n(Matuska 2007).\nIn the event of an influenza pandemic\nwith a clinical infection rate of 35%, and\nassuming 100% pharmaceutical coverage of\nthe infected population, approximately\n3.0 ng OC would accumulate in each liter of\nwater in Lake Mead. Expectations are such\nthat only 25% of the infected population\nwill receive Tamiflu (U.S. Department of\nHealth and Human Services 2006), resulting\nin < 1 ng\/L in Lake Mead. Given the average\n3.9-year retention time within Lake Mead\n(LaBounty and Burns 2005; LaBounty and\nHorn 1997), the OC concentrations will\naccumulate (OC is poorly biodegradable) in\nthe lake over the course of a pandemic\u2014\nunlike in rivers, which were previously mod-\nelled (Singer et al. 2007). Hence, risk\ncharacterization of the LC indicates that the\npredicted environmental concentration of\nOC will be well below levels known to\ninduce viral resistance (Aoki et al. 2007;\nHurt et al. 2007).\nOne remaining concern is the poor mix-\ning and highly stratified nature of Lake\nMead; for example, the wastewater input\ninto the lake is often slow to mix completely\nwith the rest of the water column (LaBounty\nand Horn 1997), resulting in 40-times\ngreater perchlorate levels in the themocline\n(30\u201340 m depth), than in the epilimnion or\nhypolimnion (LaBounty and Burns 2005).\nSuch observations can be used to predict\nthat OC concentrations > 80 ng\/L may be\nexpected in the thermocline in a pandemic\nsituation. However, because wastewater\ncomprises only 1.5% of Lake Mead\u2019s flow\nand because the water in Lake Mead is dis-\ncharged through the Hoover Dam from the\nhypolimnion, the location of lowest pollu-\ntion, there is a low risk to the environment\nas a consequence of OC release.\nAlthough we are pleased that the risk to\nthe LC is lower than originally reported, this\nreinterpretation does not change the overall\nthrust of the article (Singer et al. 2007):\nAfter an influenza pandemic, OC concen-\ntrations in rivers would be considerably\ngreater than previously seen for any other\npharmaceutical, with the actual impact vary-\ning based on dilution within a catchment.\nThe authors declare they have no competing\nfinancial interests.\nAndrew C.

(2007) provided useful infor-\nmation on the well-recognized problem of\nairways disease resulting from World Trade\nCenter (WTC) exposure, reporting a 3-year\nrisk of 3.6% for new physician-diagnosed\nasthma. As a pulmonologist in New York\nCity who has also treated many WTC\nworkers in a dedicated program, I would\nlike to share the perspectives that my clini-\ncian colleagues have shared with me. \nThe diagnosis of asthma, even if made\nby physicians, is often nonspecific and based\non symptoms that are nonspecific, as well as\ncommon. Diagnostic clues such as chronic-\nity, recurrence, response to therapy, and\nvariability in pulmonary function are not\navailable on the first visit or the first few vis-\nits. A diagnosis bias toward asthma may\noperate for many reasons: a) a group under\nsurveillance has an increased awareness of\nthe target disease; b) asthma has been widely\npublicized to physicians, as well as to the\npublic, as a result of WTC exposure; c) lists\nof accepted diagnoses required on first visits\nby monitoring and treatment programs,\ninsurance companies, and compensation sys-\ntems may guide the physician\u2019s diagnosis to\nasthma even if he\/she is not certain that this\ndiagnosis has been established; and d) bias\nmay exist in specifying the start of an on-\ngoing illness, so that patients tend to associ-\nate it with a remarkable event like the WTC\ndisaster even if symptoms or a physician\u2019s\ndiagnosis preceded this event. Wheeler et al.\n(2007) recognized the difficulty of estimat-\ning the incidence of disease, given the\npropensity of patients to cite a diagnosis that\nmay not have been substantiated and to pre-\nsent for care only if symptomatic. \nWheeler et al. (2007) noted that even if\nall exposed persons were included in the\ndenominator, the incidence of new asthma\nwas still high. Much weight is placed on the\nestimated incidence of new asthma in the\ngeneral population, for which the authors\ncited a review article, which in turn, cited a\nstudy from rural Minnesota that ended\n25 years ago (Yungingen et al. 1992).\nIncidence of asthma is affected by region\n(including rural vs. inner city), occupation,\nsmoking, temporality, and other factors.\nWheeler et al. (2007) have brought\ntheir information to public attention to be\nconfirmed by more specific criteria for diag-\nnosis, longer clinical follow-up, and addi-\ntional estimates of incidence in relevant\nurban populations.\nThe author declares he has no competing\nfinancial interests.\nAlbert Miller\nPulmonary Medicine\nCaritas Health Care\nMary Immaculate Hospital\nJamaica, New York\nE-mail: almiller@bqhcny.org\nREFERENCES\nWheeler K, McKelvey W, Thorpe, L, Perrin M, Cone J, Kass D,\net al. 2007.

In fact, the urinary mer-\ncury concentration is unlikely to be a robust\nbiological indicator for prolonged exposure\nto mercury vapor from dental amalgam.\nPrevious postmortem studies in humans\nhave shown that mercury levels originating\nfrom dental amalgam surfaces and retained\nin tissues are higher in brain regions and\nthyroid than those measured in renal cortex\n(Guzzi et al. 2006). \nThese findings are consistent with the\nfact that kidneys are the major contributors\nof urinary mercury (Magos and Clarkson\n2006; Nuttal 2004), and the concentrations\nof mercury in urine may not reflect the tis-\nsue retention of mercury in more sensitive\ntissues such as brain and endocrine glands.\nThis might explain the association between\nan increased frequency and severity of clini-\ncal symptoms among individuals with den-\ntal amalgams and consistently reduced\nlevels of excretion of total mercury in urine\n(Minoia et al. 2006; Nilsson and Nilsson\n1986). \nIn addition, Woods et al. (2007) listed\nseveral factors that may be involved in the\ndifferences in urinary mercury concentra-\ntions between the sexes. However, they did\nnot mention bruxism in the text. Bruxism\nhas an important causative role in the\nincreased concentration of mercury in urine\n(Barregard et al. 1995). Because various\nreports have suggested that bruxing behav-\nior may increase the urinary levels of mer-\ncury (Isacsson et al. 1997), Woods et al.\nshould have included it as a potential con-\nfounder factor. \nAs a result of their randomized trials,\nWoods et al. (2007) evaluated the influence\nof sex on mercury excretion rates. They\nfound that girls have a more significant\nincrease in the rate of mercury excreted in\nurine than boys. Thus, this association\nmight confer a lower mercury toxicity risks\nin girls. \nOur experience regarding the care and\ntreatment of adverse mercury amalgam\nevents among adult individuals does not\nsupport the hypothesis that males might be\nmore susceptible than females to the adverse\nevents caused by long-term exposure to mer-\ncury vapor from amalgams (Guzzi et al.\n2005). Our findings, which were derived\nfrom an ongoing study regarding clinically\nsignificant adverse events occurred in 289\nadults patients due to mercury amalgam fill-\nings, showed that females are two to three\nA 286 VOLUME 116 | NUMBER 7 | July 2008 \u2022 Environmental Health Perspectives\nCorrespondence\ntimes more likely to develop local (e.g.,\nlichenoid contact stomatitis) or systemic\nadverse health outcomes (e.g., skin disor-\nders) compared with males [217 of 289 were\nwomen (75.09%) with a median age of 43;\n72 of 289 were men (24.91%) with a\nmedian age of 40.5; female to male ratio,\n3.1:1]. Therefore, in our experience, adult\nfemales were more likely to be affected by\nprolonged exposure to mercury vapor\nreleased from dental amalgams. \nMoreover, given that inorganic mercury\n[Hg2+] binds mainly to thiol ligands [\u2013SH]\nas homocysteine (Bridges and Zalups 2004),\nwe suggest that future clinical trials address-\ning the role of sex in mercury excretion\nshould include an evaluation of serum\nhomocysteine, which is higher in males than\nin females and might account for an\nincreased tissue retention of mercury\n(Novembrino et al. 2006). \nFinally, Woods et al. (2007) did not con-\nsider the importance of determining whether\nthe exposure to mercury vapor emitted from\namalgams may affect the immune system of\nchildren (Pigatto and Meroni 2006). Indeed,\nmercury-induced immunotoxicity arises far\nearlier than overt toxicity in the renal and\ncentral nervous systems. \nThe authors declare they have no competing\nfinancial interests.\nGianpaolo Guzzi \nItalian Association for Metals and\nBiocompatibility Research\nMilan, Italy \nE-mail: gianpaolo_guzzi@fastwebnet.it \nPaolo D.
