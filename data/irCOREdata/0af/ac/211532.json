The instru-\nment would have as its twin objectives both to enhance the confidence of\nconsumers in making cross-border transactions, and to eliminate differences\nin national laws that may discourage businesses from exploring the full\npotential offered by the single market. Following the co-decision procedure\nlaid down in Article 251 of the EC Treaty, which requires the agreement of\nboth Council and the European Parliament, the legislative process secured\nmany significant amendments to and clarifications of the Commission\u2019s orig-\ninal proposal. Yet, in its essentials, the Directive has achieved the bold ambi-\ntion of the Green Paper, namely to enact a mandatory general principle of\ngood faith to govern the practices of traders engaged in selling products and\nservices to consumers across all market sectors. This essay examines the cen-\ntral provisions of the new Directive, which Member States are required to im-\nplement by 2007.3\nI. The General Principle of Good Faith\nArticle 5(1) of the Directive asserts that: \u2018Unfair commercial practices shall be\nprohibited.\u2019 Unlike previous Directives, this pronouncement is not limited to\nparticular market sectors or to specific modes of communication used by\nbusiness. The principal limitation on its scope is simply that it only applies to\nbusiness to consumer commercial practices. This central provision therefore\nestablishes a general clause, which is likely to provoke uncertainty about the\ncontent of the law unless the Directive contains adequate devices to pin down\nits meaning.\nArticle 5(2) defines the meaning of \u2018unfair\u2019 by describing two criteria by\nwhich to assess a commercial practice:\n418 ERCL 4\/2005\nand 2002\/65\/EC and Regulation No 2006\/2004, OJEC L 149\/22 (11. 6. 2005). Except\nwhere otherwise indicated, references in notes to Articles and Annexes are to this Direc-\ntive.\n2 COM(2001) 531 (2 October 2001); see also the Commission\u2019s Follow-up Communica-\ntion to the Green Paper on EU Consumer Protection, 11 June 2002, COM(2002) 289.\nThe Commission has in fact been making proposals for legislation regarding fair trading\nsince at least 1978: see H.-W. Micklitz, \u2018A General Framework Directive on Fair Trad-\ning\u2019, in H. Collins (ed), The Forthcoming EC Directive on Unfair Commercial Practices\n(The Hague: Kluwer Law International, 2004) 43, 44\u201345.\n3 Dir 2005\/29 Art 19 \u2013 to be precise 12 June 2007.\nHugh Coll ins\nBrought to you by | London School of Economics and Political Science\nAuthenticated\nDownload Date | 10\/21\/14 1:19 PM\n(a) it is contrary to the requirements of professional diligence, and\n(b) it materially distorts or is likely to materially distort the economic behaviour with\nregard to the product of the average consumer whom it reaches or to whom it is\naddressed, or of the average member of the group when a commercial practice is\ndirected to a particular group of consumers. \nThe Directive explicates many of the terms used in that standard of unfair-\nness. \nThe requirement of \u2018professional diligence\u2019 in Article 5(2)(a):\nMeans the standard of special skill and care which a trader may reasonably be expected\nto exercise towards consumers, commensurate with honest market practice and\/or the\ngeneral principle of good faith in the trader\u2019s field of activity.4\nThere is no further clarification of the principle of good faith. The standard of\nprofessional diligence tries to steer a path between, on the one hand, merely\nendorsing current marketing practices, which may already be unsatisfactory,\nand, on the other, imposing a subjective standard in the sense that whenever a\nconsumer feels duped or pushed around by a trader, the conduct would be\nregarded as unfair. The crucial element in constructing this middle path is the\nnotion of the reasonable expectation of the consumer, which permits the\ncourt to establish an objective test by use of the standard of reasonableness.\nAt the same time, however, this test does not fall into the trap of merely\nreflecting existing market practices, for the trader\u2019s conduct must conform to\nprofessional standards rather than the standards of an ordinary person, and\nthose standards must themselves conform to principles of good faith and\nhonesty. \nThe second limb in Article 5(2)(b) is more closely defined. A \u2018material distor-\ntion\u2019 means:\nUsing a commercial practice to appreciably impair the consumer\u2019s ability to make an in-\nformed decision, thereby causing the consumer to take a transactional decision that he\nwould not have taken otherwise.5\nAnd the concept of a transactional decision is described broadly to include\nwhether, how and on what terms to purchase, pay for, retain, or dispose of a\nproduct, including the exercise of any contractual rights.6 The concept of a\n\u2018product\u2019 refers to any goods or service including immovable property, rights\nand obligations.7\nERCL 4\/2005 419\n4 Art 2(h).\n5 Art 2(e).\n6 Art 2(k).\n7 Art 2(c).\nThe Unfair Commercial Practices Directive\nBrought to you by | London School of Economics and Political Science\nAuthenticated\nDownload Date | 10\/21\/14 1:19 PM\nThe concept of a commercial practice itself is defined as \u2018any act, omission,\ncourse of conduct or representation, commercial communication including\nadvertising and marketing, by a trader, directly connected with the promo-\ntion, sale or supply of a product to consumers\u2019.8 This broad definition is\nlikely to include any acts and omissions of a business that are calculated to\nenhance the prospects of selling goods and services to a consumer. The re-\nquirement of a direct connection seems to exclude traders who are only\nperipherally involved in the unfair commercial practice, such as the printer\nwho produces a misleading document. Perhaps the most significant limita-\ntion on the relevant types of commercial practice is that the conduct must be\none that is likely to \u2018distort\u2019 the economic behaviour of consumers, either by\nimpairing their ability to make an informed choice or by impairing their\nfreedom to choose. For example, a decision by a business to put poor quality\nproducts onto the market is not an unfair commercial practice for the purpo-\nses of this Directive, but any false indications by the business that the goods\nare of high quality or aggressive techniques employed to prevent consumers\nfrom obtaining appropriate redress after sales are likely to fall within the\nscope of the Directive. In a sense all advertising, whether truthful or not, is\ndesigned to alter the economic behaviour of consumers, but it will not fall\nwithin the scope of the Directive\u2019s prohibition, either because it will not be\nregarded as a \u2018distortion\u2019 that \u2018impairs\u2019 choice, or because the advertising\nconduct is not contrary to the requirements of \u2018professional diligence\u2019.\nAt the heart of the Directive lies the good faith standard. When the Commis-\nsion originally proposed a general standard, many reservations were express-\ned about the possible vagueness and uncertainty that such a standard might\ncreate. The Commission argued in favour of a general standard on the ground\nthat businesses were always inventing new techniques for selling to consum-\ners, some of which might be unfair, and that the legislative process aimed at\nsector-specific measures would always prove too slow to prevent the use of\nnovel unfair commercial practices unless it contained some general provision\nthat the courts and administrative agencies could apply. Instead of the legisla-\nture constantly playing \u2018catch-up\u2019, the Commission urged that the law should\nbe devised so that it could \u2018catch-all\u2019. Business interests and some govern-\nments objected that the resulting vagueness of the law would create consider-\nable uncertainty about whether or not new marketing techniques were pro-\nhibited. Furthermore, a general standard could be interpreted differently in\nnational jurisdictions, so that the alleged benefit of comprehensive and uni-\nform European legislation, namely that there would be a reduction of barriers\n420 ERCL 4\/2005\n8 Art 2(d).\nHugh Coll ins\nBrought to you by | London School of Economics and Political Science\nAuthenticated\nDownload Date | 10\/21\/14 1:19 PM\nto trade, would be lost in the process. Instead of achieving uniformity, a Di-\nrective that relied on a general clause might simply end up by provoking new\ndifferences between national laws.9 From comparative studies of consumer\nprotection regimes, it could also be observed that although some countries\nincluding the United States, Australia, and Denmark had general standards to\ngovern unfair commercial practices that apparently caused no great difficul-\nties for business, it was also true to say that these countries also possessed\ngovernment agencies that could provide more detailed, binding guidance on\nthe meaning of the general clause in particular context in order to overcome\nproblems of vagueness.10\nThe need to address this concern about the vagueness of the general standard\nexplains much of the subsequent detail of the Directive. We can identify three\nstrands in the endeavour to render the general standard more predictable.\nFirst, the Directive contains unusually detailed definitions of its terms, includ-\ning the concept of unfairness as described above. Second, the Directive iden-\ntifies two principal kinds of unfair commercial practice, namely misleading\ninformation and aggressive commercial practices, and defines these concepts\nin some detail. These two types of commercial practice, as defined, are declar-\ned to be automatically unfair.11 These two types of unfair commercial practice\ndo not, however, prevent the general standard from applying to other types\nof commercial practice if they fall within the definition. Third, the Directive\ncontains in Annex 1 a list of those commercial practices which \u2018shall in all\ncircumstances be regarded as unfair\u2019.12 This \u2018black list\u2019 contains thirty-one\nexamples of prohibited commercial practices. It includes such techniques as\n\u2018bait and switch\u2019, false statements about the limited availability of the goods\nat a particular price, and creating the false impression that the consumer has\nwon a prize when in fact the consumer will have to incur expenditure such as\npurchase of a product to obtain the prize.13 This list is likely to provide a\nvaluable guide to courts and administrative authorities in their application of\nthe Directive and national implementing legislation, and will certainly assist\nthe process of harmonisation of laws at a European level. Nevertheless, these\nERCL 4\/2005 421\n9 G. Teubner, \u2018Legal Irritants: Good Faith in British Law or How Unifying law Ends Up\nin New Divergences\u2019, (1998) 61 Modern Law Review 11.\n10 For comparative studies obtained by the European Commission see research reports \nat: http:\/\/ europa.eu.int\/comm.\/consumers\/cons_int\/safe_shop\/fair_bus_pract\/green_\npap_comm.\/studies\/index_en.htm; see also, Department of Trade and Industry, Com-\nparative Report on Consumer Policy Regimes (London, October 2003), available at:\nwww.dti.gov.uk\/ccp\/publications.htm.\n11 Art 5(4).\n12 Art 5(5).\n13 Annex 1, paras 6, 7, and 31 respectively.\nThe Unfair Commercial Practices Directive\nBrought to you by | London School of Economics and Political Science\nAuthenticated\nDownload Date | 10\/21\/14 1:19 PM\nexamples of blatant unfairness will not directly assist decisions in borderline\ncases of unfairness except through reasoning by analogy. In practice, it seems\nlikely that most contested commercial practices will fall under the heading of\ntwo main forms of automatic unfairness: misleading practices and aggressive\npractices. \nIn brief, a misleading practice is described as one that contains false informa-\ntion or \u2018in any way, including overall presentation, deceives or likely to de-\nceive the average consumer, even if the information is factually correct\u2019, and\nthat information relates to the nature and characteristics of the product, the\nprice, the nature and attributes of the trader, the legal rights of the consumer,\nand the extent of the trader\u2019s commitments, the motives for the commercial\npractice and the nature of the sales process, and claims regarding sponsorship\nof the trader or the product.14 This rather comprehensive list extends from\nmisleading price indications, such as claims that prices of goods have been\n\u2018slashed\u2019 (whereas in fact the price is more or less the same as before), to com-\nmercial practices through which the trader pretends that no sale is envisaged\nat all, as where the trader purports to be carrying out a \u2018survey\u2019 or asking\npeople to participate in a \u2018free trial\u2019. A misleading practice can also be com-\nmitted by a misleading omission of material information,15 which raises the\ntopic of duties to supply information that will be considered below.\nThe Directive also specifies in some detail the characteristics of aggressive\ncommercial practices that will be regarded as automatically unfair. \nA commercial practice shall be regarded as aggressive if, in its factual context, taking\ninto account of all its features and circumstances, by harassment, coercion, including\nthe use of physical force, or undue influence, it significantly impairs or is likely to sig-\nnificantly impair the average consumer\u2019s freedom of choice or conduct with regard to\nthe product and thereby causes him or is likely to cause him to take a transactional de-\ncision that he would not have taken otherwise. \nAs well as catching trading practices that use threatening language or threats\nto take action that cannot be legally taken, this provision is designed to ex-\ntend to more subtle techniques of coercion. For example, some traders, hav-\ning succeeded in obtaining entry to a potential customer\u2019s home, without\nmaking any explicit threats simply fail to leave the premises until something\nhas been signed, and the consumer, particularly if frail and elderly, may reach\nthe point of being willing to sign anything to get rid of the salesman. Another\nexample of harassment contained in the black list of automatically unfair\ncommercial practices is the making of persistent and unwanted solicitations\n422 ERCL 4\/2005\n14 Art 6(1).\n15 Art 7(1).\nHugh Coll ins\nBrought to you by | London School of Economics and Political Science\nAuthenticated\nDownload Date | 10\/21\/14 1:19 PM\nby telephone or other remote media. Indeed the black list encourages a broad\nmeaning for aggressive practices by some of its examples. In particular, it\nmentions two perennial problems for consumers. The first is for an insurance\nbusiness to require a consumer who wishes to claim on an insurance policy to\nproduce documents which could not reasonably be considered relevant as to\nwhether the claim was valid, or systematically to fail to respond to pertinent\ncorrespondence, in order to dissuade a consumer from exercising his contrac-\ntual rights. Notice in this example that the aggressive practice is constituted\nby an omission, namely the refusal to answer correspondence. A second prob-\nlem suffered by every parent is the inclusion in advertisements of a direct\nexhortation to children to persuade their parents to buy advertised products\nfor them. The scope of this prohibition depends crucially on the difference\nbetween a direct and an indirect exhortation, since all advertising aimed at\nchildren contains an indirect exhortation, even if it is disguised as a sugges-\ntion to the children to ask Santa Claus for a particular present.\nThese three techniques for rendering the concept of unfairness more precise\nand predictable will reduce, though certainly not eliminate entirely, the con-\ncerns of business about the vagueness and unpredictability of a general stand-\nard. The Directive does not employ a fourth technique that was suggested,16\nnamely to enable Codes of Conduct established by trade associations in co-\noperation with national and transnational authorities to provide more deter-\nminate guidance on permitted and prohibited commercial practices. This sug-\ngestion included the idea that compliance with a relevant trade code would\nprovide a safe haven for a business in the sense that it could not be regarded\nas having committed an unfair commercial practice. Although this technique\nfor creating certainty is not endorsed by the Directive, the legislation does\npermit national authorities to encourage trade associations to establish Codes\nof Conduct, and for those trade associations to police the conduct of their\nmembers. Even so, the national authorities must retain the power to take legal\nor effective administrative action against unfair commercial practices regard-\nless of whether alternative remedies may be available under a code of con-\nduct.17 The Directive provides further support for codes of conduct by in-\ncluding in the black list of unfair commercial practices both a claim to be a\nsignatory to a code of conduct when the trader is not, and a false claim that a\ncode has been endorsed by a public authority.18 In addition, the Directive\nERCL 4\/2005 423\n16 For various suggestions of this kind, see: H. Collins, \u2018EC Regulation of Commercial\nPractices\u2019, in Collins, n 2 above, 1, 30; Micklitz, n 2 above, 43, 76; and G. Howells, \u2018Co-\nregulation\u2019s Role in the Development of European Fair Trading Laws\u2019, in Collins, n 2\nabove, 119.\n17 Art 10.\n18 Annex 1, paras 1 and 3.\nThe Unfair Commercial Practices Directive\nBrought to you by | London School of Economics and Political Science\nAuthenticated\nDownload Date | 10\/21\/14 1:19 PM\nprovides that where a trader indicates in a commercial practice that he is\nbound by a code, and the trader does not comply with firm, verifiable com-\nmitments contained in the code, that conduct shall be regarded as an unfair\ncommercial practice.19 Thus, whilst conformity to a code does not provide a\nsafe harbour for a trader, non-conformity to a precise obligation under a code\nto which the trader has associated his business will automatically result in a\nfinding of an unfair commercial practice. The failure to provide any kind of\nsafe harbour for traders within a code does raise the possibility that traders\nwill decline to subscribe to codes, since their breach may result in an automa-\ntic finding of unfairness, whereas membership only affords the uncertain\nbenefit of promoting consumer confidence.20\nII. The Implications for European Contract Law\nThrough its broad scope and general standard the Directive plainly intro-\nduces a significant control over marketing practices throughout Europe. The\nobligation on Member States is to ensure that adequate and effective means\nare created to combat unfair commercial practices.21 These means must in-\nclude measures that enable appropriate national authorities and organisations\nto bring legal or administrative procedures that will result in orders for the\ncessation of unfair commercial practices.22 Furthermore, national law must\ninclude the power for courts or administrative authorities to impose penalties\nfor the unfair commercial practices, and these penalties \u2018must be effective,\nproportionate and dissuasive\u2019.23 With these enforcement requirements, the\nDirective plainly intends Member States to create a regulatory apparatus that\nuses injunctions and fines in order to prevent and deter the use of unfair com-\nmercial practices. The question then arises, especially for readers of this jour-\nnal, of what are the implications of this Directive for the evolution of contract\nlaw in Europe.\n424 ERCL 4\/2005\n19 Art 6(2)(b).\n20 Department of Trade and Industry, The European Commission\u2019s Consultation on the\nFollow-up Communication to the Green Paper on EU Consumer Protection: Re-\nsponse of the UK Government (London: DTI, October 2002) para 28.\n21 Art 11(2).\n22 Art 11(2). In addition, by Art 16, the need to provide effective enforcement measures\nincludes both its inclusion in the procedures for collective actions for injunctive relief\n(Dir 98\/27) and the duty to promote cooperation between national authorities respon-\nsible for the enforcement of consumer protection law (Regulation No 2006\/2004).\n23 Art 13.\nHugh Coll ins\nBrought to you by | London School of Economics and Political Science\nAuthenticated\nDownload Date | 10\/21\/14 1:19 PM\nOn one level, there are no direct consequences for contract law. The Directive\ntries to insist that it has no implications for national or European contract\nlaw:\nThis Directive is without prejudice to contract law and, in particular, to the rules on the\nvalidity, formation or effect of a contract.24\nIn other words, the Directive does not require national laws to adopt a prin-\nciple that, if the formation of a contract is tainted by an unfair commercial\npractice, the contract itself should be invalid or voidable. Nor does the Direc-\ntive require national laws to provide compensatory remedies to the victims of\nunfair commercial practices. On a formal level, therefore, the national rules\ngoverning fraud and coercion are unaffected by the Directive. Yet we can an-\nticipate that the Directive and its implementing national legislation are likely\nto have two effects on the evolution of contract law in Europe.\nFirst, the presence of implementing legislation in the national legal system\nseems likely to influence the development of private law. Where a marketing\npractice has been identified as unfair under rules implementing the legisla-\ntion, with the business therefore committing an administrative or criminal of-\nfence, it seems likely that a court would be reluctant to refuse to permit the\nconsumer also to escape from the relevant transaction. The national rules of\nprivate law governing the formation of binding contracts usually have suffi-\ncient flexibility to be extended to cover these kinds of prohibited commercial\npractices. In the past, however, courts may have been cautious about extend-\ning the invalidity of contracts to some of the borderline instances of unfair-\nness. For example, some representations of traders may be highly misleading,\neven though not strictly speaking untruthful, and national legal systems may\nhave been reluctant to invalidate a transaction without evidence of a false\nstatement. The presence of a broad standard in consumer law may provide an\nimpetus for national courts to extend the concepts of private law, such as\n\u2018culpa in contrahendo\u2019, \u2018dol par r\u00e9ticence\u2019, and \u2018misrepresentation\u2019, to include\na wider range of misleading statements. \nIn a similar way, the concept of an unfair commercial practice may influence\nthe development of compensatory remedies for those who are harmed by\nsuch pre-contractual behaviour. Although these compensatory remedies may\nbe classified by national legal systems as either contractual, delictual, or some\nkind of hybrid, it seems clear that the Directive is not intended to affect their\ndevelopment in national law. It is possible, however, that the courts and doc-\ntrinal writers will be encouraged to extend their scope where necessary, so\nERCL 4\/2005 425\n24 Art 3(2).\nThe Unfair Commercial Practices Directive\nBrought to you by | London School of Economics and Political Science\nAuthenticated\nDownload Date | 10\/21\/14 1:19 PM\nthat a compensatory remedy will become normally available for loss caused\nby an unfair commercial practice. In some national legal systems, private law\nmay evolve so far as to regard an unfair commercial practice as a type of\nstatutory tort or wrong, which should always give rise to a compensatory\nremedy on proof of damage.\nSecondly, the Directive seems likely to have a major impact on the develop-\nment of European contract law. The Directive now forms part of the acquis\ncommunautaire, from which will be developed the \u2018common frame of ref-\nerence\u2019 and other possible measures such as an \u2018optional instrument\u2019.25 Al-\nthough the Directive is confined to transactions between a business and a\nconsumer, that restriction may not be regarded as significant in the develop-\nment of general principles of contract law in Europe, since businesses them-\nselves, particularly small business, often require equivalent protection against\nunfair commercial practices. The Directive therefore provides strong impetus\nfor the development of a general principle of good faith in the context of pre-\ncontractual negotiations. Indeed, by referring to \u2018the\u2019 principle of good faith,\nthe Directive seems to presuppose that a principle of good faith is already\npart of the acquis communautaire.26\nThe Directive also endorses other concepts that may become important\nthemes in the evolving European contract law. For example, it contains a de-\nfinition of \u2018undue influence\u2019, a term drawn from common law, but which\nnow has a European community meaning for the concept:\nExploiting a position of power in relation to the consumer so as to apply pressure, even\nwithout using or threatening to use physical force, in a way which significantly limits\nthe consumer\u2019s ability to make an informed decision.\nThis concept differs from the rather ill-defined common law concept of un-\ndue influence, which has tended to focus on situations where one party ex-\n426 ERCL 4\/2005\n25 European Commission, A More Coherent European Contract Law: Action Plan, 12 Fe-\nbruary 2003, COM(2003) 68 final, OJEC 2003 C 63\/1.

But the European\nconcept of undue influence could lay the foundation for more general provi-\nsions concerning the use of coercion in private law. The definition, as stated,\nhowever, does not seem entirely satisfactory for that purpose. It seems to in-\nsist that this subtle form of coercion should affect the weaker party\u2019s ability\nto make an informed decision. That will often be the problem, but in some\ncases of undue influence, as in my earlier example of an elderly person who\ncannot get rid of a salesman without signing a document, the pressure has the\neffect of reducing the freedom to choose to make a decision to enter a trans-\naction at all, even if the consumer has all the correct information. Perhaps\nsuch cases will be categorised under the concept of harassment, which is not\nfurther defined in this Directive.\nIII. Relevance to Competition Law\nThe new Directive is often presented as a measure of consumer protection\nlaw, though its formal legal basis was solely the internal market Treaty provi-\nsion in Article 95 ECT.27 But it also has indirect implications for competition\nlaw. Indeed, in some countries such as Germany, this topic of unfair commer-\ncial practices is regarded as an integral aspect of competition rules, with the\nbenefits to consumers as a desirable side-effect. The reason for the overlap\nbetween consumer protection and competition law is that unfair marketing\ntechniques employed by a business to increase its share of the market by dup-\ning consumers are likely to have an adverse effect on competitors. For exam-\nple, a shop in the high street that falsely claims that it has reduced its prices as\na result of a sale is likely to attract more customers, to the possible detriment\nof other shops in the high street. Similarly, a business that makes its product\nappear like a well-known brand may benefit from the good reputation of the\nbrand and divert customers away from the seller of the branded product.\nProhibition of such practices as unfair not only protects the consumer against\ndeception, but also protects the business that suffers from unfair competition. \nERCL 4\/2005 427\n27 The preamble also refers to EC Art 153, however, which suggests that consumer pro-\ntection can be regarded as an objective of the Directive for the purpose of interpretation\nin the case of uncertainty about the needs of the internal market. For the limits of the le-\ngal basis in Art 153, see: H.-W. Micklitz \/ S. Weatherill, \u2018Consumer Policy in the Euro-\npean Community: Before and After Maastricht\u2019, (1993) Journal of Consumer Policy\n285; J. Stuyck, \u2018European Consumer Law After the Treaty of Amsterdam: Consumer\nPolicy in or Beyond the Internal Market?\u2019, (2000) 37 Common Market Law Review\n367.\nThe Unfair Commercial Practices Directive\nBrought to you by | London School of Economics and Political Science\nAuthenticated\nDownload Date | 10\/21\/14 1:19 PM\nOwing to its origins as a consumer protection measure, however, the Direc-\ntive does not regulate these kinds of unfair competitive practices directly. It is\nnecessary for the national authorities to establish that consumers would be\nlikely to be deceived by the practice into taking a transactional decision that\nthey would not otherwise have taken. It is not sufficient under this Directive\nmerely to demonstrate that the trader has deliberately sought to create a mis-\nleading impression in order to induce customers to enter the shop. Neverthe-\nless, provided that the enforcement authorities can establish that a consumer\u2019s\ntransactional decision was likely to have been affected, it is an unfair com-\nmercial practice for the trader to market or promote products, including the\nuse of comparative advertising, in a way which creates confusion with any\nproducts, trade marks, trade names or other distinguishing marks of a com-\npetitor.28 Similarly, fair competition between traders will be enhanced by the\nprohibition of other kinds of misleading statements, such as false or mislead-\ning claims about the existence of a specific price advantage,29 or about the at-\ntributes of the trader.30\nThis separation in European law between competition law and consumer\nprotection law may prove untenable in the long run. In the preamble to the\nnew Directive, Council and Parliament perhaps acknowledge as much. In a\nrather unusual forward-looking statement, the preamble observes:\nIt is understood that there are other commercial practices which, although not harming\nconsumers, may hurt competitors and business customers. The Commission should\ncarefully examine the need for Community action in the filed of unfair competition\nbeyond the remit of this Directive and, if necessary, make a legislative proposal to cover\nthese other aspects of unfair competition.31\nThe purpose of this statement is no doubt to placate opposition from some\nMember States such as Germany that already have an integrated approach to\ncompetition and consumer protection, but it does suggest that it will not be\nlong before the Commission makes proposals to prevent unfair commercial\npractices more broadly, including those relating to business to business trans-\nactions.\n428 ERCL 4\/2005\n28 Art 6(2)(a); Annex 1, para 13 in the black list also includes \u2018Promoting a product similar\nto a product made by a particular manufacturer in such a manner as deliberately to mis-\nlead the consumer into believing that the product is made by that same manufacturer\nwhen it is not.\u2019\n29 Art 6(1)(d).\n30 Art 6(1)(f).\n31 Para (8).\nHugh Coll ins\nBrought to you by | London School of Economics and Political Science\nAuthenticated\nDownload Date | 10\/21\/14 1:19 PM\nIV. Maximal Harmonisation\nOne of the principal justifications for the need for the Directive on unfair\ncommercial practices was the need to increase harmonisation of laws in order\nto promote cross-border trade. The Commission argued that traders were\ndeterred from marketing their goods and services across borders for fear of\ninfringing local national laws. In other words, their marketing techniques,\nthough permitted in their country of origin, might be forbidden in the coun-\ntry where the traders were trying to sell directly to consumers. This legal risk,\nit was alleged, deterred cross-border marketing. Assuming that this problem\ndoes exist, there are a number of ways in which it might be addressed. \nOne strategy is to adopt the \u2018country of origin\u2019 principle, which has been\nused for product standards and some directives concerned with trading\nstandards.32 Under this principle, also known as \u2018mutual recognition\u2019, provid-\ned that a trader could demonstrate that the market practice was lawful in its\ncountry of origin, then that market practice could be employed without in-\nterference in other national jurisdictions. Support for this approach could be\nfound from business organisations and some national governments.33 In ef-\nfect, this country of origin principle would have provided businesses with a\nsafe harbour against enforcement of local laws when trading abroad, provid-\ned that they could secure approval of their marketing practices in their coun-\ntry of origin. For example, if one country in Europe tolerated schemes in\nwhich consumers were induced to incur expenditure by the misleading pro-\nmise of prizes, every other country would have to tolerate such scams pro-\nvided that the business running that operation had its main site of business in\nthe permissive country. This approach would certainly have overcome the\nalleged obstacle to cross-border trade presented by diversity in national con-\nsumer protection laws. But in so doing, it would have effectively levelled\ndown consumer protection against unfair commercial practices to the point\naccepted by the most permissive economies.\nIn truth, this country of origin principle, though effective in reducing barriers\nto trade and convenient for achieving political agreement in Council, has nev-\ner been very attractive as a standard for harmonisation of market rules in\nEurope. As well as perhaps encouraging a \u2018race to the bottom\u2019 in consumer\nprotection measures, a well-informed consumer living in a country with high\nERCL 4\/2005 429\n32 Eg Dir 89\/522, as amended by Dir 97\/36 (television without frontiers); Dir 2000\/31 \n(e-commerce), though these directives also establish some minimum standards.\n33 Countries supporting the country of origin principle were UK, Netherlands, Luxem-\nbourg and Estonia: Competitiveness Council, political agreement, Brussels, 25 May\n2004, 9667\/04, Annex 2, para 2.\nThe Unfair Commercial Practices Directive\nBrought to you by | London School of Economics and Political Science\nAuthenticated\nDownload Date | 10\/21\/14 1:19 PM\nlevels of protection would find no reason to alter behaviour and enter trans-\nactions with foreign companies for fear that the country of origin rules might\nprovide inferior protection. The final version of the Directive rejects the\ncountry of origin principle, and instead imposes full harmonisation. \nMember States shall neither restrict the freedom to provide services nor restrict the free\nmovement of goods for reasons falling within the field approximated by this Directive. \nThe objective of this provision is to prevent national legislatures from regulat-\ning commercial practices towards consumers in ways at variance with the\ngood faith standard adopted in the Directive. What the provision means is\nnot that Member States should not regulate this field of unfair commercial\npractices, which is what it says literally, but rather that national laws should\nnot enact rules that differ from the principles of the Directive. In particular,\nMember States are not permitted to create more stringent measures of con-\nsumer protection. In other words, the Directive is an instance of maximal or\nfull harmonisation, rather than the normal minimum level of harmonisation\nprovided by most earlier consumer protection laws. \nThe proposal for full harmonisation or, in view of the level of detail contained\nin the Directive, almost a uniform law, provoked opposition on two grounds.\nSupporters of the consumer interest were concerned that the effect of the Di-\nrective might be to require national governments actually to reduce the level\nof consumer protection. In particular, in those fields already harmonised by\ndirectives setting minimum standards, the new Directive might require Mem-\nber States to adjust their legislation downwards in order to make it less re-\nstrictive with respect to marketing practices.34 This problem has already\nemerged in connection with product liability,35 where France\u2019s decision not to\nimplement a minimum threshold for the amount of damage was held to be\nincompatible with the directive.36 A second ground for opposition to full\nharmonisation was that the new Directive would have the effect of freezing\nconsumer protection laws in Europe, so that experimentation by national\ngovernments to find new ways to protect the consumer would be inhibited\nby the need to conform to the European standard.37\nIn response the former objection, the Directive contains a circumspect derog-\nation. Until 2013 Member States may continue to apply national provisions\n430 ERCL 4\/2005\n34 For this reason Denmark and Sweden did not support the Directive: Competitiveness\nCouncil, political agreement, Brussels, 25 May 2004, 9667\/04, Annex 2, para 4.\n35 Dir 85\/374, Art 9.\n36 Case C-52\/00 Commission v France [2002] ECR I-3827 (ECJ).\n37 G.

First, the re-\nstrictive national legislation must be a law that implements an earlier directive\ncontaining a minimum harmonisation clause. Second, the retained measure\nmust be one that is essential to ensure that consumers are adequately protect-\ned against unfair commercial practices and must be proportionate to the\nattainment of this objective.38 It seems to be envisaged that the Commission\nwill be able to contest claims by Member States that their restrictive rules\nsatisfy these two conditions. If the Commission is in the mood to insist\nstrongly on uniform laws, it will be very hard for national governments to\ndefend the retention of their restrictive laws under this test. The Commission\nwill no doubt form the view that its unfair commercial practices directive\nprovides adequate protection for consumers, and that any more restrictive\nregulation is a disproportionate and unnecessary interference with the opera-\ntion of the single market. It is important to note, however, that as the new\nDirective explicitly avoids any harmonisation of private contract law, nation-\nal rules that provide compensatory remedies for consumers or the ability to\navoid contracts will not be affected by this drive for uniformity. \nThe new Directive also contains some more precise exceptions to its scope\nand coverage through which more restrictive national laws can be preserved.\nThe Directive is stated to be without prejudice to those national rules govern-\ning regulated professions that serve the purpose of upholding high standards\nof integrity on the part of the professional.39 The Directive does not apply to\nnational rules governing the certification and indication of the standard of\nfineness of articles of precious metals, such as the hallmark system for gold\nand silver used in the UK. Furthermore, the Directive is stated to apply only\na minimum standard with respect to transactions in financial services and im-\nmovable property, so that national laws may impose requirements that are\nmore restrictive or prescriptive in these fields of commerce.40 These areas are\nexcluded from the scope of full harmonisation on the ground that the typical\ncomplexity of transactions in these fields combined with the seriousness of\nthe risks to consumers may warrant more elaborate and detailed protections\nfor consumers. The new Directive also makes it clear that it does not apply to\nnational restrictions introduced for the purpose of protecting the health and\nsafety of consumers. Thus, to mention one area of controversy, rules govern-\ning tobacco advertising are not affected in so far as they are justified on the\nground of protecting the health and safety of consumers. \nERCL 4\/2005 431\n38 Art 3(5).\n39 Art 3(8); Art 2(l).\n40 Art 3(9).\nThe Unfair Commercial Practices Directive\nBrought to you by | London School of Economics and Political Science\nAuthenticated\nDownload Date | 10\/21\/14 1:19 PM\nThese derogations and exceptions from the scope of the Directive do not\nreally answer the criticisms of the uniform law that it may lead to a reduction\nin protective standards in some countries with highly developed consumer\nprotection laws, and that it may discourage experimentation in new kinds of\nprotective measures for consumers against unfair commercial practices. The\nlatter criticism may turn out to be misplaced, however, given the breadth of\nthe general standard of good faith and the considerable flexibility granted to\nMember States on modes of implementation and enforcement. Experimenta-\ntion may continue either by exploring the possible meanings of good faith or\nby devising new methods of securing compliance by traders with the general\nstandard. In particular, the reference to the reasonable expectations of con-\nsumers in the general test of unfairness may enable courts and doctrinal wri-\nters to suggest new standards or criteria with which traders should be expect-\ned to comply.\nFinally, it should be noted that the effect of maximal harmonisation is to place\nconsiderable pressure on the legal system to draw a sharp distinction between\nthe field of application of the Directive, where no deviations are permitted,\nand closely related but uncovered fields, where national law is either unaf-\nfected or merely has to comply with minimum standards contained in other\nEuropean directives. In this context the concept of an unfair commercial\npractice, considered above, will become a crucial determinant of the scope of\npre-emption by European law. Some commercial practices, though perhaps\nregarded as unsavoury or undesirable, will not fall within the scope of the\ndirective because they may not distort consumers\u2019 transactional decisions.\nFor example, regulations concerning taste and decency fall outside the scope\nof the Directive. Other regulations governing commercial communications,\nsuch as reports of companies to their investors and general promotions of a\nbrand image are also likely to fall outside the pre-empted field. In deter-\nmining the field of application of the Directive, it is important to remember,\nhowever, that it is not confined to cases concerning a trader\u2019s conduct that\nleads to a transaction; it encompasses unfair trading practices that occur out-\nside any contractual relationship between a consumer and a trader. The Di-\nrective also applies to certain aspects of the performance of contracts, as\nwhere misleading statements are made with respect to a complaint mecha-\nnism offered by the trader, or where the trader blocks an attempt by a con-\nsumer to use a complaint mechanism.\n432 ERCL 4\/2005Hugh Coll ins\nBrought to you by | London School of Economics and Political Science\nAuthenticated\nDownload Date | 10\/21\/14 1:19 PM\nV. Information Duties\nIn theory, it is possible to make a sharp distinction between the regulation of\nfalse or misleading statements and duties to provide or disclose information.\nThe former regulation controls the accuracy of information circulating in the\nmarketplace; the latter enhances the amount of information available in the\nmarketplace. The former regulation is generally regarded as necessary and de-\nsirable: the circulation of false information obstructs competition in markets\nand harms individual consumers who are the victims of fraud. But the latter\nkind of regulation, which requires producers and traders to provide informa-\ntion to their customers, is more controversial: in part because it imposes costs\non business; in part because some of that information may be regarded by the\nbusiness as confidential and commercially valuable; and in part because it is\nunclear often whether the provision of additional information really helps\ncompetition in markets or assists consumers to satisfy their preferences better\nowing to problems of information overload and the difficulty of understand-\ning technical information. But the sharp distinction often drawn between\ncontrol over misleading statements and duties to provide information tends\nto break down when we consider the proper scope of control over unfair\ncommercial practices.\nThe difficulty of drawing this distinction arises because traders may find it to\ntheir commercial advantage to be \u2018economical with the truth\u2019. Nothing that is\nactually said or written down by the seller is inaccurate, but the overall im-\npression given to the consumer is misleading, because some information that\nreveals a weakness of the product or an additional cost is omitted. In order to\naddress this problem, Article 7(1) of the new directive introduces the concept\nof a \u2018misleading omission\u2019 as an automatically unfair commercial practice.\nA commercial practice shall be regarded as misleading if, in its factual context, taking\ninto account of all its features and circumstances and the limitation of the communica-\ntion medium, it omits material information that the average consumer needs, according\nto the context, to take an informed transactional decision and thereby causes or is likely\nto cause the average consumer to take a transactional decision that he would not have\ntaken otherwise.\nThis provision might apply for instance to the purchase of a house where the\nestate agent omits to mention the government\u2019s plan to build a large road at\nthe bottom of the garden. But that material omission is not necessarily an un-\nfair commercial practice once the circumstances and the medium of commu-\nnication is taken into account. That latter qualification seems to suggest that,\nif the communication of the estate agent is given orally or perhaps in a docu-\nment that describes itself as a brief summary of the qualities of the property\nfor sale, the omission will not be regarded as material in all the circumstances.\nERCL 4\/2005 433The Unfair Commercial Practices Directive\nBrought to you by | London School of Economics and Political Science\nAuthenticated\nDownload Date | 10\/21\/14 1:19 PM\nOne response to the new Directive may therefore be an unwillingness on the\npart of some traders to provide detailed written information for fear of mak-\ning a material omission, or in the alternative, to provide information but also\nto state clearly that the document does not purport to be comprehensive and\ndoes not provide information on certain material issues that would affect a\ntransactional decision. A difficult area in this respect is price labelling in\nshops: the question is how much detail can be expected from a shop in its\nprice labelling of goods on the shelves when it offers a discount or some other\nkind of promotion. \nAn issue that is not clearly resolved by the Directive is whether it is necessary\nto demonstrate that the trader itself knew of the omitted material information\nand appreciated its importance to the transactional decision of the consumer.\nSuppose in my example that the estate agent did not know of the govern-\nment\u2019s plan, perhaps as a result of carelessness or incompetence. Would the\nfailure to disclose the information amount to an unfair commercial practice in\nsuch circumstances? In other words, are honest or negligent omissions of ma-\nterial information equally regarded as misleading commercial practices? Al-\nthough the Directive does not answer this question directly, it can perhaps be\ninferred from the concept of \u2018professional diligence\u2019,41 which forms part of\nthe general test of unfairness, that at least careless omissions should be includ-\ned in this category of misleading omissions. A similar question about the ne-\ncessary state of mind of the seller also arises in a related provision of Article\n7(2) that describes as an unfair commercial practice the case where a trader\nhides or provides in an unclear, unintelligible, ambiguous or untimely man-\nner the relevant material information.\nIn appreciating the scope of Article 7(1), it is also important to recall that a\ntransactional decision is defined in the Directive to include not only a con-\nsumer\u2019s decision whether or not to enter a contract, but also on what terms to\nenter a transaction and whether or not to exercise a contractual right in rela-\ntion to a product. Thus, for example, a seller who fails to point out to a dissat-\nisfied consumer that under the terms of the contract the consumer is entitled\nto compensation or to have the good replaced free of charge might be com-\nmitting an unfair commercial practice under Article 7(1). Equally, a trader\nwho in fact provides that information but in small print that is hard for the\naverage consumer to understand may also be committing an unfair commer-\ncial practice. \nAnother difficult question for this provision regarding omissions is to deter-\nmine what information is \u2018material\u2019 and therefore should have been disclosed\n434 ERCL 4\/2005\n41 N 4 above.\nHugh Coll ins\nBrought to you by | London School of Economics and Political Science\nAuthenticated\nDownload Date | 10\/21\/14 1:19 PM\nor made available. Part of the answer must lie in the concept of a transactional\ndecision: the information is likely to classified as material if it would have\naffected the transactional decision of the average consumer. In addition, the\nDirective provides a list of certain types of information that will be regarded\nas material in the case of an invitation to purchase.42 The trader must supply\nthat information unless it is apparent from the context.43 This duty to provide\ninformation in the context of an invitation to purchase includes the main\ncharacteristics of the product or service, the geographical address and the\nidentity of the business, the price inclusive of taxes and transport charges, the\narrangements for payment, delivery and complaint handling if they differ\nfrom the normal standards of professional diligence, and the existence of any\nright to cancellation or withdrawal. Furthermore, any other information\nrequirements established by Community law in relation to commercial com-\nmunications in general will also be regarded as material information that, if\nomitted, would be regarded as an unfair commercial practice.44 In effect, this\nprovision turns all the prior information duties towards consumers enacted\nby Community law into material information for the purpose of establishing\nan unfair commercial practice. For example, the duties imposed on tour op-\nerators to provide information concerning package holidays, such as the iti-\nnerary, mode of transport, type and class of accommodation, meal plan, and\narrangements for payment, will all be regarded now as material information,\nfailure to disclose which is contrary to the implementing provisions of the\nPackage Travel Directive,45 will also be contrary to the new Directive as an\nunfair commercial practice by comprising a misleading omission. \nIn reviewing these comprehensive provisions regarding misleading omissions\nand duties to supply information, it is worth making three further observa-\ntions. First, although confined to consumer transactions, this general duty to\nsupply material information goes further than most, if not all, private law\nsystems in Europe in setting a high requirement of disclosure.46 It seems\nlikely to encourage the courts and doctrinal writers to assert broader duties\nof disclosure in private law in order to permit consumers to escape from\nERCL 4\/2005 435\n42 An \u2018invitation to purchase is defined as \u2018a commercial communication which indicates\ncharacteristics of the product and the price in a way appropriate to the means of the\ncommercial communication used and thereby enable the consumer to make a\npurchase\u2019: Art 2(i).\n43 Art 7(4).\n44 Art 7(5). The Directive includes in Annex II a non-exhaustive list of the existing Direc-\ntives that impose information requirements in the context of advertising and marketing.\n45 Dir 90\/314, Art 3.\n46 See the analysis in R. Sefton-Green (ed), Mistake, Fraud and Duties to Inform in Euro-\npean Contract Law (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005).\nThe Unfair Commercial Practices Directive\nBrought to you by | London School of Economics and Political Science\nAuthenticated\nDownload Date | 10\/21\/14 1:19 PM\ntransactions into which they have entered as a result of an unfair commercial\npractice. In steering this development, the new Directive introduces a novel\ndistinction between commercial practices that form part of an invitation to\npurchase, and commercial practices that are merely aimed at influencing a\ntransactional decision. That distinction enables the legislation to insist upon\nprecise disclosure requirements that apply at the time of sale. The concept of\nan invitation to purchase may provide the foundation for the evolution of\nmore intensive and precise duties of disclosure and good faith in pre-contrac-\ntual negotiations. \nSecond, with respect to the uniform standard or maximal harmonisation estab-\nlished by the new Directive, it should be observed that where national laws\nhave implemented earlier Directives that permit more stringent standards, as\nin the case of the Package Travel Directive, those additional national duties \nto provide information to the consumer will not be regarded as material\nomissions for the purpose of establishing an unfair commercial practice. The\nretention in national law of those additional duties to supply information will\nonly be permitted, however, under the test of proportionality described\nabove.47\nFinally, it should be noted that there is an overlap between the concept of\nmisleading omissions contained in the new Directive and the duties of infor-\nmation proposed in the draft Sales Promotion Regulation.48 A sales promo-\ntion is a commercial communication designed to promote the goods, services,\nor image of a business by means of offering discounts, free gifts (buy one, get\none free), a premium such as a voucher towards another product, or by offer-\ning a promotional contest or game. When making such sales promotions, the\nproposed regulation describes in detail the information that must be supplied\nby the promoter. In the case of the promotion by means of discounted prices,\nfor instance, the proposed regulation requires a trader to supply the exact\nvalue of the discount, the reference price, and any limitations applicable to\nthe discount. The proposed Regulation is also intended to establish a uniform\nlaw in order to reduce barriers to cross-border trade. There is no indication,\nhowever, either in the new Directive or in the proposed Regulation of how\n436 ERCL 4\/2005\n47 See text at n 38 above.\n48 Amended Proposal for a Regulation concerning Sales Promotions in the Single Market\nCOM(2002) 585 final, Brussels 25.10. 2002; Following disagreements in Council, the\nDutch presidency proposed various compromises that were not accepted: Sales Promo-\ntion Regulation 17 September 2004 (12498\/04), and Note of Competitiveness Council\nMeeting of 24 September 2004.

For\nexample, will the failure to provide the exact value of any discount amount to\nan unfair commercial practice? Under the proposed regulation, the duty to\nsupply that information is an absolute one, whereas under the Directive there\nis always the qualification that the omission of material information may be\nexcusable where that is justified by reasons of limitations of space and time\nimposed by the communication medium used, or where that information\nshould have been apparent in the context.\nVI. Credulous Consumers\nThe British government frequently issues the warning: \u2018If it seems too good\nto be true, it is\u2019. Nevertheless, promises that seem too good to be true circu-\nlate in vast numbers, which suggests that at least a few consumers are seduced\nby the various scams. Children, young people, the elderly and infirm may be\nthe most common victims of these kinds of rackets. When most consumers\nreceive a letter saying that they have won a vast prize in a competition that\nthey have not entered, they put it in the bin. But some will call the telephone\nhotline at great expense, or send off the necessary payment to obtain their\nprize. In short, whereas many misleading offers and statements will not\nchange the economic behaviour of the average consumer, they may affect a\ncredulous consumer.\nThe new Directive uses the average consumer as its principal test for whether\nor not the commercial practice is unfair. Hence a hyperbolic statement about a\nproduct that an average consumer would not treat seriously will not be caught\nby the Directive\u2019s prohibitions. But that focus on the average consumer, which\nfollows the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice, is qualified in\nthree ways. First, the average consumer is defined as the average member of\nthe group when a commercial practice is directed to a particular group of con-\nsumers.49 Thus when a commercial practice is directed towards the elderly and\ninfirm, the level of sophistication and credulity expected from the consumer\nwould be that of the average member of that group of consumers, not an aver-\nage of the population as a whole. Second, where a commercial practice is of a\ntype that is likely to materially distort the economic behaviour of an identifia-\nble group, such as children, because they are particularly vulnerable to the\npractice or the product, again the fairness of the commercial practice should be\nassessed from the perspective of the average member of that group.50 Finally,\nERCL 4\/2005 437\n49 Art 5(2)(b).\n50 Art 5(3).\nThe Unfair Commercial Practices Directive\nBrought to you by | London School of Economics and Political Science\nAuthenticated\nDownload Date | 10\/21\/14 1:19 PM\nhowever, the Directive reasserts that there are some exaggerated statements in\nadvertising that are not meant to be taken literally, and that no consumer, no\nmatter how credulous or na\u00efve, should rely upon.51\nVII. The Coherence of the Acquis Communautaire\nThe new Directive was always regarded as a type of framework Directive in\nthe sense that it would provide general standards to govern the wide range of\nactivities involving in advertising and marketing. It was hoped that the sheer\nbreadth of the Directive would assist in bringing coherence to the acquis\ncommunautaire. Since the EC had already introduced a considerable amount\nof legislation in this field, however, the question arose of how to bring the\nwhole body of law into systematic harmony. The general principle contained\nin the Directive is that more specific legislation on particular issues will\nexclude the general standards of the framework.\nIn the case of conflict between the provisions of this Directive and other Community\nrules regulating specific aspects of unfair commercial practices, the latter shall prevail\nand apply to those specific aspects.52\nThe effect of this provision is to leave in place prior Directives either when\nthey impose higher standards of consumer protection or lower standards.\nIn addition, the new Directive makes a few attempts to harmonise the law by\namending prior legislation. For instance, the Directive on misleading advertis-\ning is amended to exclude advertising directed towards consumers, so that its\npurpose is now solely to protect other traders, and in particular to prevent\nmisleading, denigrating, comparative advertising.53 With respect to inertia sel-\nling, this is now a prohibited unfair commercial practice under the new\nDirective,54 but the rules in the earlier directives on distance selling,55 which\nprevent the consumer from incurring any private law obligations, such as an\nobligation to pay for unsolicited goods, are re-enacted.56 It seems unlikely\nthat these few measures will have dealt with all the potential overlaps between\nthe new framework Directive and the existing acquis communautaire.\n438 ERCL 4\/2005\n51 Art 5(3).\n52 Art 3(4).\n53 Art 14, which amends Dir 84\/450. The definition of \u2018misleading\u2019 in the amended Direc-\ntive on advertising does include, however, the definition provided in the new Direc-\ntive.\n54 Annex I, para 29.\n55 Dir 97\/7 (distance selling), Art 9; Dir 2002\/65 (distance marketing of financial services),\nArt 9.\n56 Art 15.\nHugh Coll ins\nBrought to you by | London School of Economics and Political Science\nAuthenticated\nDownload Date | 10\/21\/14 1:19 PM\nYet the most important issue with respect to the coherence of the acquis com-\nmunautaire concerns the question whether it is useful in the long run to draw\nthe sharp distinction contained in this Directive between business to con-\nsumer transactions and business to business interactions. This distinction\nmay have more to do with the division of responsibilities within the Com-\nmission than with the development of a coherent body of European law to\ngovern marketing. It is noteworthy in this context that the proposed Regula-\ntion on Sales Promotions is not confined by reference to the need to protect\nconsumers. Arguments for regulating unfair commercial practices based\nupon market failure and the need to promote a competitive market throu-\nghout Europe apply equally to business to business transactions. There is no\nreason to suppose that a professional cannot be duped by misleading state-\nments or coerced by aggressive practices in some instances. Furthermore,\neven if a case can be made for regarding the protection of consumers as a pri-\nority in Europe, as we have previously noted, any measure in this field of\ncommercial practices has an indirect impact on other traders by protecting\nthem from unfair competition from other businesses. Member States such as\nGermany and Austria, where national laws adopt an approach that integrates\nthe protection of both entrepreneurs and consumers, objected to this exclu-\nsive focus on consumers, and insisted that they would continue to adopt an\nintegrated approach in national law whilst conforming to the Directive.57\nThat move may create pressure to create a more coherent body of European\nlaw with regard to unfair competitive practices that does not introduce the\nartificial exclusive emphasis on consumer protection.\nVIII. Conclusion\nAt a time when prospects for further measures of European integration look\nrather poor following the defeat of the proposed Constitution, the new Di-\nrective on unfair commercial practices amounts to a remarkable political\nachievement. Despite vigorous opposition from some Member States on the\ngrounds that the law provided either too much or too little protection for\nconsumers, and also that in any case it was an unnecessary duplication of na-\ntional laws, the Commission has succeeded in pushing through this flagship\nlegislation within its agenda of enhancing consumer confidence in the inter-\nnal market. Perhaps a key ingredient in this success has been both a willing-\nness to produce a more detailed legislative text than is common with Euro-\nERCL 4\/2005 439\n57 Competitiveness Council, political agreement, Brussels, 25 May 2004, 9667\/04, Annex\n2, para 3.\nThe Unfair Commercial Practices Directive\nBrought to you by | London School of Economics and Political Science\nAuthenticated\nDownload Date | 10\/21\/14 1:19 PM\npean directives combined with a relatively clearly defined policy objective\nthat informs all the measures. \nIndeed, a general impression left after reading the new Directive is that it was\nwritten by economists, using a theory of market failure, without much atten-\ntion to prior law. It is replete with concepts that seem to be derived from text-\nbooks on economics such as \u2018material distortion of the economic behaviour\nof consumers\u2019, a \u2018transactional decision\u2019, and \u2018invitation to purchase\u2019. The Di-\nrective seems to be relatively uninterested in issues that frequently concern\nlawyers, such as the question whether the trader has to be proved to be at\nfault in some sense, or how to construct the necessary enforcement mecha-\nnisms. For instance, the Directive offers only meagre guidance on one impor-\ntant practical issue concerning the burden of proof. When the legal issue is\nwhether or not the trader\u2019s claims are factually accurate, the Directive sug-\ngests that, where appropriate, national law may require the trader to provide\nevidence of a statement\u2019s accuracy.58 The Directive therefore does not endorse\na general requirement that the burden of proof should be placed on the trader\nto demonstrate the truthfulness of claims, as one might expect in a Directive\naimed at consumer protection, but instead rather leaves the issue up in the air\nby indicating that such a requirement may be imposed when \u2018appropriate\u2019 in\nthe circumstances of a particular case. National implementing legislation the-\nrefore enjoys a wide range of choice regarding how it constructs the burden\nof proof save that it must leave open the possibility of placing the burden on\nthe trader in at least some instances of misleading statements. Nor has the Di-\nrective really thought through the potential interaction between legislative\nstandards and codes of conduct, a matter of considerable interest for con-\nsumer groups and lawyers. The development of transnational codes for speci-\nfic sectors could provide the most reliable method for protecting consumers,\nbut the Commission does not appear to have pursued that option vigorously,\nno doubt because it would be even harder to obtain than the new legislation.\nGiven this focus of the Directive on the economic problem to be addressed\nrather than issues of legal process and doctrine, when national governments\nhave to implement this Directive through national legislation, they will have\nto confront not only the usual task of translating European measures into\nterms and concepts that will function satisfactorily within their national legal\nsystems, but also they will have to find ways of translating the economic con-\ncepts into workable legal concepts. In so doing, we may observe the increas-\ning use of economic terminology throughout European private law systems:\na colonisation by economic discourse of legal discourse. \n440 ERCL 4\/2005\n58 Art 12.\nHugh Coll ins\nBrought to you by | London School of Economics and Political Science\nAuthenticated\nDownload Date | 10\/21\/14 1:19 PM\nYet this translation problem will certainly not prove to be the hardest aspect\nof the task of national implementation legislation. The lazy route of simply\ncopying out the provisions of the Directive and enacting them as domestic\nlaw will not work in this instance. The use of maximal harmonisation requi-\nres national legislators to amend or eliminate inconsistent national laws that\noccupy the same field as the Directive. Unless the national rules fall within\none of the derogations described above, any existing legislation that controls\nunfair commercial practices will have to be revised so that it does not impose\nadditional duties on traders. Implementation of the Directive will require na-\ntional authorities to review the entire corpus of their consumer protection\nlaws in order to eliminate possible conflicts.59 Although the general duty to\nrefrain from unfair commercial practices may not differ in substance from\nparticularistic, sector specific, national legislation, maximum harmonisation\nwill require the elimination of any more onerous or stringent requirements\nimposed on traders. \nERCL 4\/2005 441\n59 For a study of the possible impact of the directive see: http:\/\/europa.eu.int\/comm\/con-\nsumers\/cons_int\/safe_shop\/fair_bus_pract\/impact_assessment_en.pdf.\nThe Unfair Commercial Practices Directive\nBrought to you by | London School of Economics and Political Science\nAuthenticated\nDownload Date | 10\/21\/14 1:19 PM\n"}
