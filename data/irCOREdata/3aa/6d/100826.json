We show the\nNDC and the switching effects in the FE measurements. This\nwork is inspired by our recent success in implementing a\nRTD using the a-C system for high-speed switching devices8\nand by the outstanding physical properties of carbon related\nmaterials, such as high electron mobility, high breakdown\nfield, high thermal conductivity, and low threshold fields for\nelectron emission.9,10\nFigure 1 shows the energy band structure of the a-C\nnanolayers. The layers were prepared by the ablation of a\ngraphite target \u000199.999% purity\u0002 using 248 nm pulsed UV\nexcimer laser \u0001Lambda Physik LPX 210i\u0002 at a chamber pres-\nsure of \u000510\u22127 mbar. The substrates used were n-type \u0001100\u0002\nSi wafers \u0001resistivity \u00020.05 \u0003 cm\u0002, with samples growth\nwithout any substrate heating. The band gap \u0001Eg\u0002 of the\na-C layers was modulated by the laser fluence. First, a 3 nm\nthick sp3 rich \u000185% sp3 and Eg=2.8 eV\u0002 a-C layer was de-\nposited on the Si with the laser fluence of 20 J \/cm2, which\nserved as the bottom potential barrier for the structure. This\nwas followed by another sp2 rich a-C layer \u000150% sp3 and\nEg=1.5 eV\u0002 with thicknesses of 3, 4, and 6 nm, using a laser\nfluence of 4 J \/cm2 and served as the \u201cwell\u201d layer. The sp2\nrich surface layer is bound by the sp3 rich layer at the back\ncontact, with a barrier height of 0.65 eV, and a vacuum bar-\nrier of 4.0 eV \u0001electron affinity of carbon\u0002 on top of the\ndevice. Hence, it forms an asymmetric QW structure. In ad-\ndition, single layered 6 nm thick a-C layers, either sp2 rich\nor sp3 rich, and double layered a-C structures with opposite\nlayer arrangements \u0001sp3-sp2-Si\u0002 are also fabricated as control\nsamples. The details of the fabrication process and character-\nization of these a-C layers are published elsewhere.8,11 The\nFE properties of the samples were studied at room tempera-\nture in a high vacuum chamber with a base pressure better\nthan 5\u000110\u22124 Pa.

The mea-\nsurements were preformed in different areas of each sample\nand the high voltage was cycled up and down three times to\ncheck the homogeneity and repeatability of each large area\nsample produced. The applied electric field was obtained by\ndividing the applied voltage by the gap distance.\nA typical I-F characteristic of the sample with a quan-\ntum well structure of sp2-sp3-Si is plotted on a logarithmic\nscale in Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002, where the thickness of the sp2 and sp3\nlayers is also 3 nm. The characteristics of this sample are\nextremely different from the conventional Fowler-Nordheim-\ntype-tunneling curve as shown for the control samples in Fig.\n2\u0001b\u0002. NDC with a peak at the field \u0001Fp\u0002 of 15 V\/\u0004m and an\nabrupt increasing of emission current over four orders of\nmagnitude swing \u0001switching effect\u0002 at a field \u0001Fs\u0002 of\n25 V\/\u0004m is observed with anode gap distances of 30 and\n40 \u0004m, at different regions of the same sample for three\nsuccessive measurements. The variation of Fp and Fs with\nrespect to the thickness of the sp2 layer is shown in Fig. 3.\nThese results suggest that the characteristics of the sp2-sp3\n-Si structure do not originate from a conditioning effect in\nthe a-C films. We propose that these characteristics can be\nattributed to resonant tunneling across the QW structure.\nAs shown schematically in Fig. 1, the conduction band\nminima \u0001EC\u0002 of the sp2 layer was split by the QW structure\nand creates a subband E1. As the thickness of the sp2 rich\na-C layer is only a few nanometers in thickness and the Eg\nis \u00051.5 eV, the applied electric field can effectively pen-\netrate through the sp2 layer and fully deplete this thin semi-\nconductor film. The fully depleted sp2 a-C layer could create\nelectric fields much greater than the macroscopic field exter-\nnal to it.12\u201314 Similar to the space charge induced band bend-\ning model for amorphous materials in which the Si substrate\nacts as the electron source,12\u201315 Semet et al.5 and\nWang et al.7 proposed an identical hypothesis for GaN based\ndouble layered structures. We postulate electron injection\nfrom Si into the sp2 \u201cwell layer\u201d through the 3 nm thick sp3\nlayer by field penetration. This then allows for electrons to\naccumulate in the subenergy levels in sp2 layer, which can be\nemitted under the right conditions. Although, the accumula-\ntion of electrons in the sp2 well will screen out the external\nfield and reduce the field penetration, this space charge con-\ncentration in the sp2 layer will give a space potential and\ncreate an upward energy band bending in the sp2 layer, as\nshown in Fig. 1\u0001b\u0002 at the front positive end of the sample.\nAccording to the equation derived by Semet et al.,5 the space\npotential energy by the electrons accumulated in the first\nsubenergy level \u0001E1\u0002 can be estimated as VSC\n= \u0001\u00050 \/4\u00060\u0006r\u0002\u0006\u0001w \/\u0007\u00022 sin 2\u0001\u0007x \/w\u0002+wx\u2212x2\u0007, where w is the\nthickness of the sp2 layer and \u00050 is the space charge density\n\u0001is proportional to the energy difference between the first and\nthe second subenergy level\u0002. The E2\u2212E1 is calculated to be\n0.45 eV \u0001E1=0.2 eV and E2=0.65 eV\u0002 for the effective mass\nm*\u00050.06, \u0006r\u00054, and w=3 nm which is further confirmed\nby modeling.8,15 Hence, the average value of the band bend-\ning in the sp2 layer attributed to the space potential\nis \u00050.2 eV and is comparable to E1. When Ec of the Si\nsubstrate is aligned with the first confined energy E1 by this\nband bending, resonant tunneling can occur and hence the\nemission current will increase. However, when the field\n\u0001\bFp\u0002 is further increased, the energy level E1 will align\nwith the forbidden gap of the Si substrate. Hence, the condi-\ntion of resonant tunneling disappears and the emission cur-\nrent decreases with increase of electric field, and hence,\nNDC is observed.\nHowever, as the field is further increased, at a higher\nempirically predicted value Fs, the valence band maxima\n\u0001EV\u0002 of the Si substrate will be aligned with energy level E1.\nResonant tunneling can then once more commence and\ntherefore an abrupt increase in the emission current is\nachieved. Since the electron concentration in the valence\nband is very high, as it is nearly a full band, the condition for\nresonant tunneling is still valid with further increase in the\nelectric field. Identical a-C structures should be fabricated on\nFIG. 2.

As shown in Fig. 3, Fp and Fs\nare monotonically increasing with width \u0001d\u0002 of the well \u0001sp2\nlayer\u0002. Although, the oxygen content, its change upon current\noxidation and local thickness fluctuations will all slightly\nmodify the FE properties, from the transmission electron mi-\ncroscopy measurements any thickness fluctuations are sig-\nnificantly less than the well thickness.11 Hence, it is expected\nthat Fp and Fs should monotonically decrease with d as\nE1\t1\/d2 for an infinite QW. Such a reduction could be the\nresult of a decrease in field penetration as the thickness of the\nsp2 layer increases and the dependence of the local field\nenhancement on thickness of the a-C layer is a possible ex-\nplanation. Although the layer-thickness effect on the FE\nproperties of sp2-sp3-Si structure is under investigation, it\nshows the possibility of tailoring the position of the resonant\ntunneling peak Fp and switching-on field Fs, by varying the\nlayer thickness.\nIn summary, we demonstrate negative differential con-\nductance and switching effects in electron field emission\nfrom a-C based quantum confined structures \u0001sp2-sp3-Si\u0002.\nThe positions of the NDC and the switching fields are de-\npendent on the thickness of the sp2 layer. As the thickness of\nthe sp2 layers increasing from 3 to 6 nm, the Fp and Fs in-\ncrease from 15 to 39 V\/\u0004m and from 25 to 56 V\/\u0004m, re-\nspectively. These anomalous FE properties in term of the\nresonant tunneling effect could be useful for high-speed elec-\ntronics such as oscillators and fast switching devices, which\nmakes a-C very attractive as a large area electronics thin\nfilm.\nThe authors thank the financial support from the EPSRC\nin the form of a Portfolio Partnership Award.
