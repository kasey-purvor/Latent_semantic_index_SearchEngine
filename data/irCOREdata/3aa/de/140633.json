Terrestrial ecosystem risk assessment by comparison with the aquatic discipline remains\nin its infancy yet is advancing quickly in response to increasing concerns surrounding soil quality\nand the sustainable use of soil. Several international frameworks have been developed during the\nlast decade to aid decision makers as the need for scientifically derived tools for determining\necological risk from land contamination has been recognised. From the regulatory viewpoint, the\npriority is establishing what to protect in order to prevent ecological harm. This is a complex issue\nrequiring clear objectives in a risk assessment context. The most important factor in assessing\necological harm is whether or not ecosystem function is altered as a result of land contamination\nand if it is, judging the significance. A consensus is developing that ecological risk assessment\nshould aim to protect populations rather than individuals. This paper critically reviews and\nconsiders recent developments in risk assessment for terrestrial ecosystems and land contamination\nin the UK with emphasis on deriving a measure of ecological harm to assess ecosystem function.\nWe seek to further justify the use of earthworms as a favoured indicator species for protecting\necological function. Guidance on how to measure harm in relation to ecological function is,\nhowever, still lacking.\nKeywords: Ecological harm, ecosystem function, land contamination, risk assessment,\nenvironmental protection, earthworm\nINTRODUCTION\nEcosystem management has been described as a magnet for controversy (Lackey 1998), conflict\nand debate as exemplified by serious national aquatic ecosystem problems in the 1960s and 1970s\n(Ferguson et al. 1998). An ecosystem is defined as a community of organisms and their physical\nenvironment interacting as an ecological unit (Lincoln et al. 1998). Ecosystems are dynamic\ncomplex living systems subject to important continual and natural processes of change in response\nto various internal and external stresses. Exposure to soil contamination can be one such stress that\ncan have consequences to terrestrial ecosystems e.g. the reduction of earthworm population size due\nto mortality or as more sensitive parameters, reduced growth and reproduction.\nThe type and severity of ecological impacts and effects governs the likelihood and rate of ecological\nrecovery. Ecological change or harm caused by stressors such as contamination within an\necosystem will result in slower recovery than adaptation and evolutionary change might otherwise\nallow, possibly with maintenance of a degraded state (Whitford et al. 1999). There are various ways\nof describing land, the degree of contamination within it and the consequences for specified\necological receptors.\nWhilst primitive civilisations have demonstrated respect for natural systems, the post industrial\nsociety has become separated from the nature and value of earth\u2019s life support systems until their\ndisruption or loss highlighted their importance (Slobodkin 2000). Even as late as the early 1990s,\nauthors (Spellerberg & Minshull 1992) were bemoaning the poor quality of ecological inputs into\nenvironmental impact assessments. Though all ecosystems have been at some risk from human\nimpacts for millennia, the use of chemicals has increased over time. It was only two decades ago\nthat ecological risk analysis was promoted as a new concept (O'Neill et al. 1982) when laboratory\ntoxicity data were extrapolated to field-scale aquatic ecosystems. Ecological risk assessment is\ninherently more complex (i.e. multi species) than human health risk assessment and ecologically\nrelevant data are often based on aquatic systems (Scott-Fordsmand et al. 1996). The terrestrial\necosystem risk assessment discipline is advancing but is still in its infancy.\nRisks are often characterised on the basis of individuals and so extrapolation is also required from\nthe individual to population level. There are many reasons, other than scale, why extrapolation\ntechniques are limited and these are reviewed elsewhere (Douben & Siepel 1993; Forbes & Forbes\n1993; Suter 1993; L\u00f8kke 1994; Shore 1995; Spurgeon & Hopkin 1995; Spurgeon 1997; Suter\n1998; Forbes et al. 2001; van Beelen et al. 2001).\nThe monitoring of a species within an ecosystem can provide an indication of ecological harm.\nSome ecosystems are maintained for their importance and scientific interest e.g. in order to protect\nrare species or habitats that are often the basis of a site being designated. Designated sites are the\nbasis of the Part IIA contaminated land legislative regime in the UK. Other ecosystems are\nconsidered to be more general e.g. farmland and contaminated sites that fall outside of Part IIA that\nmay require management and remediation. Ecosystems evolve naturally due to the presence of\nniches that allow new species to thrive and others to decline. Thus through niche differentiation\ncertain species may have advantages over others. Human intervention in the form of management is\nusually to the advantage of rare species. This implies that all species have a value, whether artificial\nor real and the value of rare species is often perceived to be higher than \u2018common\u2019 species even\nthough the ecological value expressed as ecological function can be of equal or greater importance.\nEcological effects may not be significant if ecological function is maintained. Early case studies of\nobserved ecological effects were not necessarily related to harm or ecological function. For\nexample, probable effects were noted on the evidence of metal contaminants found in organs of\navian and mammalian species and densities of invertebrate species in soil litter were greatly reduced\nas a result of metal contamination from two zinc smelters in Pennsylvania, USA (Beyer et al. 1985).\nAnother study demonstrated effects on two small mammals and two soil invertebrate species caused\nby fluoride contamination from an aluminium plant at Anglesey in North Wales (Walton 1986,\n1987). Ecological effects finally became related to ecosystem function in the 1990s typified by\npublished case studies on earthworm growth, reproduction, sexual development and early cocoon\nproduction affected by heavy metal contamination from zinc smelters in The Netherlands\n(Posthuma et al. 1994) and the UK (Spurgeon & Hopkin 1996a,b; Spurgeon & Hopkin 1999a).\nThe assessment of harm to terrestrial ecosystems from contaminated land is a main facet of the UK\ncontaminated land regime. If ecological harm is to be prevented, understanding the behaviour and\neffects of contaminants in the environment is important and is a central aim in ecotoxicology\n(Forbes & Kure 1997). The ability to predict this quantitatively is required to avoid harm. In the\nabsence of an objective definition for terrestrial ecological quality (CLARINET 2001), the\nassessment of ecological effects and harm is difficult to establish. There is a scarcity of published\ncase study information for terrestrial ecosystems against which to assess the ecological meaning of\n\u2018safe\u2019 concentrations (Posthuma 1997) and causal relationships between soil quality and their\necosystem functions still need to be demonstrated (Herrick 2000). Contemporary risk assessment\nmethods do not suggest or identify consequences to a particular ecosystem if exposure exceeds\ndefined \u2018safe\u2019 contaminant thresholds, other than that population responses are observed in the field\n(Posthuma 1997).\nThe extent of land contamination worldwide is considerable though estimates vary. In 1998 the\nEuropean Environment Agency reported that over 300,000 potentially contaminated sites had been\nidentified in Western Europe alone (Andersen 2000). This provides an indication of the scale of the\nproblem though national estimates vary considerably, for example (Environment Agency 2000b;\nRoyal Commission on Environmental Pollution 1996). In the UK, the historic assessment of land\ncontamination (1970s to 1990s) has been based on defined \u2018trigger values\u2019 or reference values for\nindividual contaminant concentrations in soil, for example the ICRCL values (Inter-Departmental\nCommittee on the Redevelopment of Contaminated Land 1987). Other countries, including\nGermany, the Netherlands, Canada, Japan, Estonia and Bulgaria, have developed guideline values\nfor assessing the extent or significance of soil contamination. There has been much concern that soil\nguideline values, as surrogates for assessing harm, are frequently misused through lack of\nunderstanding (Ferguson 1994). The use of reference values does not account for important\necological characteristics such as the severity of effect e.g. irreversibility and spatial or temporal\nextent. This restrictive approach is evolving into a combination of chemical, ecotoxicological and\necological approaches as scientific understanding develops. Part IIA of the Environmental\nProtection Act 1990 is the first UK legislation specifically to cover historic land contamination.\nWhilst Part IIA seeks to protect a wide range of receptors, the only ecological receptors protected\nare designated habitats and species e.g. particular species that are the basis of Sites of Special\nScientific Interest (SSSIs). In restricting the legislation to designated receptors, the most sensitive,\nvaluable or rare ecosystems should be protected. Other UK legislation, for example the Wildlife and\nCountryside Act 1981, also exists to protect such wildlife. However in some cases the long-term\nmaintenance of a population or a species at any location may depend upon the sympathetic\nmanagement of areas beyond the boundaries of a protected location (English Nature 2001).\nLEGISLATIVE REGIME\nNatural soil is one of the key elements enabling life on earth (Achazi 2002) and justifiably soil is\nnow protected in its own right. In 2002, in response to soil degradation concerns, the European\nCommission outlined a strategy for soil protection throughout the EU, putting soil protection on a\npar with water and air (European Commission 2002). In the UK there are many laws containing soil\nprotection aspects including the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. The primary legislation for\ncontaminated land in England and Wales is set out in Part IIA (S78A-S78YC of the Environmental\nProtection Act 1990, as inserted by Section 57 of the Environment Act 1995; Statutory Guidance\ncontained in DETR Circular 02\/2000 (Department of Environment Transport and the Regions\n2000a); and the Contaminated Land (England) Regulations 2000 (Department of Environment\nTransport and the Regions 2000b). This new regime came into force in England on 1 April 2000\nand is the first UK legislation to deal exclusively with land contamination. Part IIA is based on the\npolluter pays and risk management principles and it only applies to existing (historic) contaminated\nland not being dealt with under different legislative regimes such as Integrated Pollution Prevention\nand Control.\nDefinition of contaminated land in the UK\nThe legal definition of contaminated land is provided in statutory guidance contained in Section\n78A(2) (Department of Environment Transport and the Regions 2000a) as any land which appears\nto the local authority in whose area it is situated to be in such a condition, by reason of substances\nin, on or under the land, that (a) significant harm is being caused or there is a significant\npossibility of such harm being caused; or (b) pollution of controlled waters is being, or is likely to\nbe caused\u2026 The new regime is profoundly restricted by the definition and is subject to\ninterpretation. The regulatory regime set out in Part IIA involves a tiered approach that involves (a)\nproblem identification, (b) risk assessment, (c) determination of appropriate remediation\nrequirements, (d) consideration of costs, (e) establishment of who should pay and (f)\nimplementation and remediation (Environment Agency 2000a). The Contaminated Land (England)\nRegulations 2000 (Department of Environment Transport and the Regions 2000b) set out further\nrequirements, particularly in respect of the content of remediation notices.\nDesignated areas\nSites of national and sometimes international importance for nature conservation are notified as\nSSSIs by the Government\u2019s statutory conservation agencies (English Nature, Scottish Natural\nHeritage and the Countryside Council for Wales). SSSIs presently cover more than 7% of land in\nEngland and Wales and the protection of such sites for their wildlife value is a priority. Many SSSIs\nare showing damage or neglect; an assessment of SSSIs in England, Scotland and Wales indicated\nthat in England, 58% of SSSI land by area was in favourable or recovering condition, leaving 42%\nin unfavourable condition (English Nature 2003). Having established the principles of the\necological risk assessment in the context of the legislative regime, the basis of ecological risk\nassessment is highlighted below.\nThe identification and assessment of the likelihood of ecological harm for a particular site is not\nstraightforward. There is the possibility that the remediation of a site defined as being contaminated\nunder the Part IIA regime may compromise the survival of species that have adapted to the\nconditions at that site e.g. arsenic tolerance in earthworms at mine spoil sites in the UK (Langdon et\nal. 1999). In this scenario, the remediation activity itself may result in more harm that might have\notherwise occurred by not carrying it out, thus compromising ecosystem function. The adaptation of\nspecies is valuable in contributing to biodiversity and equally biodiversity may diminish if that\nspecies is removed by remediation. Such issues must be considered when assessing the need for\necological protection.\nAPPROACHES TO ECOLOGICAL RISK ASSESSMENT\nDefinitions\nA UK definition of ecological risk assessment is \u201can evaluation of the likelihood of adverse effects\non organisms, populations, and communities from chemicals present in the environment\u201d\n(Environment Agency 2003). This definition recognises that ecological effects can occur at\ndifferent levels but it lacks specific reference to the need to maintain ecological function. The\nUSEPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency 1998) similarly defines ecological risk\nassessment as \u201ca process that evaluates the likelihood that adverse ecological effects may occur or\nare occurring as a result of exposure to one or more stressors\u201d.\nInternational approaches\nA review of international approaches to ecological risk assessment demonstrates that similar\napproaches are taken, usually on a tiered basis, and that different levels of protection or tolerable\neffects may be derived. Generally, most countries use generic guidelines for a first screening of\necological risk (Ferguson et al. 1998). The basis, limitations and benefits of the approaches in\nselected countries are presented in Table 1. Many countries, including the UK, are only at the stage\nof developing or agreeing suitable frameworks. The need for a common European framework in the\nform of a conceptual model has been identified and formulated (CLARINET 2001 & Crommentuijn\net al. 2001). The approach adopted in the Environment Agency\u2019s consultation document on a\nframework for ecological risk assessment (Environment Agency 2003), follows the conventional\napproach to environmental risk assessment and management in the UK, as contained in revised\ndepartmental guidelines. This provides a tiered framework for characterising the source, pathway,\nreceptor relationship (Department of Environment Transport and the Regions et al. 2000). All three\ncomponents of a linkage must be present for a risk to exist.\nEcological risk assessment requirements\nAn ecological risk assessment has two fundamental requirements on a site-specific basis;\ninformation on exposure and information on an effect(s). Exposure data typically consists of pore\nwater, soil quality and tissue concentrations in the receptor, and must include ambient reference or\ncontrol areas to allow for the presence of naturally elevated \u201ccontaminants\u201d e.g. arsenic in parts of\nthe south west of the UK. In earthworms, organic chemicals are taken up through the skin (Jager et\nal. 2003) and dermal uptake has been separated from exposure arising from ingestion in the gut.\nThe ingestion route becomes preferential for hydrophobic contaminants (Jager et al. 2003) such as\nbenzene, toluene, ethylene, BTEX compounds, chlorinated solvents and nitrotoluene contaminants.\nA fundamental concept of ecological risk assessment is that increased exposure time increases\ntoxicity or decreases the lethal concentration (usually LC50, defined as the lethal concentration to\n50% of the organisms over a given time period in an acute toxicity study).\nTRIAD approach\nEcological risk assessment requires an integrated approach based on a number of measures and\ncriteria (Rutgers et al. 2000). The triad approach has often been adopted as a basis for interfacing\nchemical, toxicological and ecological information (Chapman 1986; Chapman 1992; Breure &\nPeijnenburg 2003). In this approach, toxicology is assessed by the use of bioassays as experiments\nin which organisms are exposed to site-specific field samples and ecological responses are observed\nunder standard conditions (van Straalen 2002) and normalised to reference data. This approach is\nlikely to be adopted in England and Wales (Environment Agency 2003).\nNo observed effect concentrations\nEcological risk assessment is often based on the standardised No Observed Effect Concentration\n(NOEC) as the toxicity input parameter (Posthuma 1997). NOEC is a reference level derived as the\nconcentration at which there is no toxicological effect (acute or chronic though usually chronic) on\nan ecologically relevant characteristic (typically reproduction) for a chosen receptor after different\ndoses (usually of individual chemicals) have been applied, usually in the laboratory. Organisms are\nmore sensitive to lower NOECs in a given soil. Legislation in the Netherlands is the most advanced\nin Europe with regard to ecological risk assessment for contaminated land and the approach of the\nDutch Soil Protection Act (Netherlands Ministry of Housing Spatial Planning and the Environment\n1994) is to maintain and restore the multifunctionality of soil. The role of ecology is defined by use\nof the HC50 whereby the hazardous concentration for 50% of the geometrical mean for all available\nNOECs (assuming log normal distribution) is applied. A procedure for performing population-level\necological risk assessments was required at the Federal level in Oregon, USA (Hope & Peterson\n2000). There, the acceptable risk is defined legislatively as 10% or less chance that 20% or more of\nthe total local population would receive an exposure greater than the toxicity reference value for a\ngiven substance. As with the Netherlands approach, the toxicity reference value for populations of\necological receptors is defined as the LC50. The use of NOEC is a good starting point but it is\nlimited as NOECs are based on individual substances rather than chemical mixtures and actively\ngrowing organisms are most sensitive to contaminants, thereby making the age of organism an\nimportant factor. Even protection of 95% of the species is also unlikely to protect rare or indicator\nspecies (Forbes & Forbes 1993; Hopkin et al. 1993). The determination of unacceptable and\nacceptable risk for land contamination in the UK has not been tested and case law is likely to be\nimportant in setting a precedent.\nHARM TO TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEM RECEPTORS\nTable A of the DETR Circular (Department of Environment Transport and the Regions 2000a)\nspecifies the receptors to be protected under Part IIA. The terrestrial ecological receptors in Table A\nare presented in Table 2. Designated areas are defined in DETR Circular 02\/2000 which defines\nsignificant harm to terrestrial ecosystem receptors amongst others. Significant harm is described as\nthat which results in an irreversible or other substantial adverse change in the functioning of the\necological system\u2026 or that which affects any species of special interest\u2026and which endangers the\nlong-term maintenance of the population of that species at that location.\nEcological harm and its assessment is a general underpinning concept of the Part IIA legislation and\nthis section therefore focuses on Part IIA receptors. This concept requires development in order to\ndefine how to measure harm in relation to ecological function. Information likely to be required for\na site-specific risk assessment to determine harm is presented in Table 3. The de minimus ecological\nrisk can be a lack of evidence for an impact on selected species or ecosystem function. Other\nauthors suggest a 20% level as the threshold for a de minimus level of significant ecological effect\n(Suter et al. 2000) beyond which restoration is required.\nHarm to terrestrial ecosystems can be assessed by considering soil quality. Biological indicators of\nsoil quality include nitrogen and carbon availability, leaf litter decomposition and soil fauna\npopulations, including arthropods and invertebrates. Whilst the measurement of these indicators is\nreadily achievable, their contribution towards the definition of contaminated land and ecological\nharm is uncertain. In calculating organism exposure, the critical factor is likely to be the amount of\nsoil ingestion. Soil quality indicators are important to ensure maintenance of soil function for\ncurrent and future land uses. Historically, reliance has been placed on assessing soil quality based\non individual chemical data without considering synergistic or additive effects.\nAssessment of soil quality within a protected area of ecological value can indicate the nature and\nspatial distribution of contamination present. Soil quality is defined as the capacity of soil to\nfunction as a vital living system to sustain biological productivity, promote environmental quality\nand maintain plant and animal health within natural or managed ecosystem boundaries and\nincluding the support of human health and habitation (Karlen et al. 1997). In the absence of a\nEuropean standard for soil quality many countries have developed their own standards and guidance\nbased around that of the USEPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency 1998). A\ncommon approach is to start with the endpoint, for example develop guideline values based on land-\nuse. This is the basis of the Netherlands approach (van de Leemkule et al. 1999; van Hesteren et al.\n1999; van Wensem et al. 2000; van Wensem & Vegter 1998). The use of such values is\nquestionable when remediation is initiated (Crommentuijn et al. 2000), since if soil quality shows\nmarginal exceedance, remediation cannot be justified on the basis that costs outweigh the benefits.\nEcological protection and conservation: individuals or populations?\nThere are different ecological risk assessment endpoints, the selection of which depends on the\nlevels of biological organisation in question i.e. individual, population, community and entire\necosystem. There is increasing scientific and policy consensus in the UK (Department of\nEnvironment Transport and the Regions 2000a) that ecological risk assessment should aim to\nprotect populations rather than individuals, for example against loss of species diversity (Posthuma\n1997). Ecosystems do not exist in the same way that organisms (as individuals) exist (Calow 2000).\nPopulation effects are typically assessed by quantifying abundance, mortality and reproduction.\nWith the exception of endangered species which are protected as individuals, most species decisions\nare based on population level effects (Suter et al. 2000).\nReviews of terrestrial population models for ecological risk assessment have been carried out\n(Emlen 1989; Hope 1995) including the role of such models (Barnthouse 1992). These reviews\nconcluded that the most easily accessible and appropriate endpoints for population assessment are\npseudoextinction (the probability of a population falling below a predetermined fraction of its\nundisturbed level) and temporal mean population density. Effective conservation measures require\nknowledge of factors affecting population persistence and the magnitude of their effects (Fahrig\n2001). Case studies have demonstrated population level effects along pollution gradients. These\neffects can be significant, for example reduced cocoon production rates and reduced growth rates\nevident in earthworms around the Avonmouth smelter in the UK (Spurgeon 1997). Though no\nearthworm mortality was evident, it was probable that zinc was affecting earthworm reproduction, a\nmore sensitive indicator and therefore population viability close to the smelter.\nModelled simulations of habitat loss and species extinction (Ak\u00e7akaya 2001) suggest that habitat\npreservation and restoration is the highest priority for ecosystem protection. The prediction of\nextinction thresholds requires organism movement rates. Conservation strategies should consider\nthe whole landscape quality, not just the protected habitat, since most ecosystem functions are\nspatially and temporally dependent (Herrick 2000; Fahrig 2001). Critical ecosystems are those with\nhigh ecological diversity, potential for long-term sustainability and presence of relic or native\ncommunities (Noss 2000).\nSignificant harm and significant possibility of significant harm\nAssessing the significance of risk is the final stage of the risk assessment process, following hazard\nidentification and identification, magnitude and probability of the consequences (Department of\nEnvironment Transport and the Regions et al. 2000). For ecosystems this is defined as being when\ngrowth, reproduction, or mortality is adversely affected, such that the survival of the\npopulation\/community\/species is threatened (Environment Agency 2003). Species composition may\nchange naturally whilst such functions remain unaffected. The importance of maintaining a high\nlevel of ecological biodiversity is uncertain, though an ecosystem does not need to be highly diverse\nin order to maintain ecological function.\nExposure assessment\nExposure represents the probability of harm that can be measured by a dose response relationship or\nby bioavailability. Determining the choice of receptor is crucial and it requires careful\nconsideration. Designated areas may require the consideration of harm that affects any species of\nspecial interest. A primary assumption is that the habitat determines which and how many receptors\nare exposed. Assuming that the main objective is to protect, evaluate or measure habitat function,\nspecies with a high sensitivity to suspected contaminants are required.\nThe USEPA use six criteria for exposure assessment (United States Environmental Protection\nAgency 1998). These are (1) how exposure occurs i.e. pathway analysis; (2) what is exposed i.e.\nreceptor analysis; (3) quantifying the amount of exposure spatially and temporally; (4) variability of\nexposure; (5) uncertainty of exposure estimates; and (6) probability of exposure i.e. risk assessment.\nThe duration of exposure can be important and shorter-term exposure may be more significant to\nspecies of low ecological relevance. If the relevance becomes higher then the exposure needs to be\nlonger-term. This relationship also helps understand where the ecological response lies.\nEffects assessment\nThe effect represents the consequences of harm; contaminant availability does not equal harm. The\npossibility of significant harm is crucial but is subject to interpretation and definition. Definitions of\nharm must be quantified in order to determine if a given contaminated land site is contaminated\nland under Part IIA. Ecological effects data typically takes into account organism, species or\npopulation parameters such as fecundity, adult survival, reproduction and population growth.\nThere are four conventional biological measures that can be used to demonstrate whether a source-\npathway-target relationship constitutes significant harm, all of which have the ability to describe\nbiological organisms or ecosystem components chemically. Biomarkers and toxicity tests are\nindirect measures and critical body residues and bioaccumulation are direct measures.\nEcosystem effect indicators are a promising way of portraying human influence on ecosystems, if\nsufficient information is provided for decisions to be made (Merkle & Kaupenjohann 2000). Whilst\necosystem effects indicators can be developed (Figure 1) there is always a need to use indigenous\ncommunities.\nAssessment of ecological harm must have predictive capability if irreversible effects are to be\nprevented. However, response to contamination is not entirely predictable (Noss 1990) and\necosystem sensitivity undoubtedly varies. This reiterates the need for an approach combining\npredictive modelling and monitoring.\nUSE OF EARTHWORMS FOR ASSESSING ECOLOGICAL\nFUNCTION AND HARM\nEcological relevance of soil invertebrates\nThe value of soil invertebrates other than earthworms, such as nematodes, mites and springtails is\nhigh and is related to their ecological role, e.g. litter decomposers regulate energy flow and nutrient\ncycles. Many soil invertebrates can be used for monitoring the status of soil ecology and the\nselection of species for a particular study should be given careful thought. Earthworms are a\npreferred indicator because key ecological functions are adversely affected by their absence.\nNematodes are the most abundant ecologically relevant species, followed by mites and then\nspringtails. Composition of nematode communities in soil may indicate levels of soil contamination\n(Lau et al. 1997). Critical factors in selecting species as indicators of harm to an ecosystem are their\necological relevance, ecological importance and sensitivity. Other less important factors include\nabundance, ubiquity, ability to survive in different soil conditions and ability to be exposed to\nmultiple pathways.\nContaminants can be resistant to decomposition processes, e.g. polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs),\nand therefore they accumulate in soil (van Brummelen et al. 1996). Soil invertebrates easily become\nexposed to such contaminants, potentially affecting their ecological functioning. Indicator species\nmay change temporally so it is important to identify the species that are responsible for maintaining\nfunction. Earthworms and woodlice are ecologically relevant soil invertebrate fauna and as such are\ngood indicator species. However, the use of soil invertebrate bioindicators and the measurement of\ntoxicity endpoints such as mortality and biomass loss require careful validation by field studies and\nshould not simply be reliant on extrapolation from laboratory data.\nWhy earthworms?\nEarthworms have been used increasingly for ecological risk assessment since the introduction of\ninternational standards including the OECD acute earthworm toxicity test in 1984 (Spurgeon et al.\n2003). There are many reasons why earthworms are widely used and they are now regarded as a\nmodel organism. Earthworm communities offer many advantages for assessing soil quality (Urzelai\net al. 2000) and they are the favoured indicator species in the Netherlands.\nEarthworms are engineers (Lawton 1994) and as Darwin intimated, they are like an\nunacknowledged elemental force (Phillips 1999). Earthworms are arguably the most important soil\nbiota in maintaining soil structure, function and fertility (Edwards 2004) and they have an important\nrole in contaminant transfer through the food chain with potential for predatory secondary\npoisoning via bioaccumulation and food chain transfer (Spurgeon & Hopkin 1996c). The\ncontribution of earthworms to soil fertility can be considerable (Killham 1994) and earthworms are\nintimately involved in organic matter decomposition (for example of surface leaf litter and the\nremineralisation and humification of organic matter). They also contribute to soil aeration and have\nlarge direct effects on nitrogen cycling (Killham 1994; Forbes & Kure 1997). Furthermore\nearthworms are likely to have long exposure periods to contaminants within land, due to their low\nmobility, increasing the likelihood of being able to establish effects in the field. Earthworms are\nalso a preferred species for ecological risk assessment because they are more highly exposed to soil\ncontaminants through ingestion and dermal contact than other soil and leaf litter invertebrates (Ma\n1994).\nEarthworms are intrinsically linked and are therefore vital to ecosystem function. As a receptor,\nearthworms can be regarded as a surrogate ecosystem, an approach advocated for the conservation\nof aquatic target taxa and communities (Hitt & Frissell 2004). Various sensitive endpoints, such as\nbiomass change and reproduction, have been identified in earthworm toxicology (Schaefer 2003).\nThe main exposure route for earthworms and most other soil invertebrates is pore water uptake\nthrough the dermis and pore water concentrations are a good measure of bioavailability (Naidu et\nal. 2000). Field contaminant exposure resulting in harm to earthworms has been demonstrated, e.g.\nfour metals released from the Avonmouth smelter (Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn), of which zinc is the limiting\nfactor for earthworm distribution (Spurgeon & Hopkin 1996b).\nEarthworm classification and ecology\nDifferent classification schemes exist for categorising earthworm communities into functional\ngroupings according to soil properties such as litter-dwellers (epigeic), mineral soil feeders and\ndwellers (endogeic) or permanent\/semi-permanent soil burrowers feeding on surface-litter (anecic)\n(Neilson et al. 2000; Edwards 2004). The ecology of earthworm species needs to be accounted for\nwhen undertaking a risk assessment as species sensitivity to contamination varies, particularly with\nregard to metal accumulation, for example (Morgan & Morgan 1999). Cadmium in particular is\nstrongly accumulated by earthworms (Mari\u00f1o & Morgan 1999). The risk of bioaccumulation can\nbe twofold; risk to earthworms and risk to species higher up the food chain. Thus, it may be\nappropriate when undertaking a risk assessment to select the most vulnerable species in order to\nderive a conservative risk estimate.\nContaminant exposure studies\nIn exposure studies most organisms, including soil biota, are ordinarily exposed to different types and\nconcentrations of contaminants. During the last decade earthworms have been used extensively both\nin the laboratory and increasingly in the field to assess sub-lethal toxicity of different soil\ncontaminants. Earthworm growth, reproduction and mortality have been recorded in response to\ndifferent exposure levels and contaminants, most commonly for metals, pesticides, PAHs and\nexplosives (see Table 4 for references to selected field exposure data).\nSeveral studies of earthworm exposure to different soil contaminants in the field and the laboratory\nhave been published that demonstrate differing degrees of harm, either as a result of direct contact\nwith the soil, or exposure to free metal concentration in the soil pore water. International test\nmethods e.g. OECD, recommend the use of the earthworm species Eisenia foetida and E. andrei,\nthough Lumbricus species are also widely used by researchers. Consequently the earthworm species\nEisenia fetida and Lumbricus terrestris have been researched more comprehensively than other\nspecies (Scott-Fordsmand et al. 2000).\nEnzmyic inhibition in earthworms is a sensitive parameter that is increasing in use. From the\nliterature we can see for example, that lead has been shown to inhibit certain enzymes in Eisenia\nfetida andrei and this inhibition is generally dependent on the dose or duration of exposure;\nsignificant changes were detected at exposure to 30 mg kg-1 (Saint-Denis et al. 2001). This\nconcentration is considerably less than the maximum permissible concentrations for soil in selected\ncountries identified in Table 1. Body concentrations of metals, that are strongly accumulated in\nearthworms, may be more representative of bioavailability and toxicity than the conventional total\nchemical or extractable soil concentrations (Mari\u00f1o & Morgan 1999). Factors including soil texture\nand structure are responsible for contaminant migration through the soil matrix. There is some\nevidence for the distribution of soil contamination also being affected by earthworm activity and\nbehaviour. Farenhorst et al. (2000) studied atrazine in laboratory microcosms in which earthworms\nwere shown to influence the distribution of atrazine in the soil matrix. In soil matrices where\nearthworms were absent, 65% of the atrazine applied remained within the top 4cm surface layer. In\nsoil profiles where earthworms were added after atrazine application, 60% of the atrazine applied\nwas translocated below 4cm by feeding activity. Toxicity of the explosive 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene and\nof octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX) have been determined in soil to the earthworm Eisenia\nAndrei (Robidoux et al. 1999; Robidoux et al. 2001). Even though HMX has limited water\nsolubility, a number of sublethal effects were identified including growth inhibition and\nreproductive effects, suggesting the cause was direct contact. These effects were present even at the\nlowest concentration tested (~280 mg kg-1). Lethality was not demonstrated, even at the highest\nconcentration tested (~2500 mg kg-1). Soil guideline values for explosive substances do not exist so\na direct comparison is not possible.\nSoil is the major sink for PAHs in the environment (van Brummelen et al. 1996). PAH\nconcentrations in the earthworm species Lumbricus rebellus and the isopods Porcellio scaber,\nOniscus asellus and Philoscia muscorum, were measured along a pollution gradient from a blast\nfurnace plant (van Brummelen et al. 1996). Species-specific profiles for PAH contamination have\nbeen identified in a soil contamination gradient near a blast furnace plant in the Netherlands;\nspecies profiles were found to be dependent on feeding behaviour, whether fragmentation or leaf\nlitter.\nDISCUSSION\nPreservation of function is of most significance to ecosystem protection. The hypothesis that, loss\nof indicator species does not impact on soil ecosystem function, requires testing in order to define\nsignificant harm for Part IIA that may also derive action levels for remediation, according to future\nland use. This approach must serve as an ecological indicator by having predictive capability and\nthe modelled prediction must be measurable whilst being sensitive to change. Although several\nspecies are used as indicators for ecosystem protection, the scientific rationale for their selection is\nnot always apparent. Current guideline values for assessing soil quality are frequently misused and\nshould be used cautiously and sparingly. For example, guideline values for lead in selected\nEuropean countries were up to one order of magnitude in excess of the level at which \u2018significant\nchanges\u2019 occurred in Eisenia fetida andrei at the biochemical level (Saint-Denis et al. 2001).\nPriorities for terrestrial ecosystem risk assessment and land contamination include detecting\necological harm, developing modelling capability to assess terrestrial ecosystem function and\naccepting uncertainty. Long-term studies which include control sites are required. Collaboration and\nsharing of knowledge is needed if consensus and credibility is to be achieved. In the absence of a\nfull model of generic risk assessment, careful detailed quantitative risk assessments ensure a\nprecautionary approach is taken. The cumulative effect of the uncertainty surrounding these\nassessments should not be underestimated. Links between specific ecological harm and the\nmonitoring of individual species have yet to be made. Studies that demonstrate ecological harm\nresulting from the presence of contamination where there is a lack of earthworms would further\njustify the use of earthworms as indicator species.\nAvailable evidence to date suggests that most contaminated land in the UK, as determined using the\nlegal definition, will be identified mainly on the basis of risks or harm to receptors other than\nterrestrial ecosystems. A survey carried out for the year 2001 identified categories of risk and\nremediation required at 68 contaminated land sites in the UK that had been remediated. Of these,\nthe protection of ecologically sensitive receptors was a factor at only 7% of sites, and protection of\nhuman health at 91% of sites (Nathanail et al. 2003). This trend is likely to continue (Quint 2001).\nCONCLUSIONS\nInternationally, because of a scarcity of empirical studies that show an elevated risk to terrestrial\necosystems from land contamination, countries have relied on generic standards that are not\nnecessarily risk based or scientifically derived. The literature demonstrates that there is a paradigm\nshift taking place towards developing risk assessment procedures for terrestrial ecosystems and the\npace of change is rapid.\nThe use of earthworms as surrogate species for terrestrial ecosystem risk assessment requires\nvalidation and a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between the functional groups is\nneeded. Future research must also critically investigate the extent to which current risk assessment\ntools, techniques, frameworks and ecotoxicological tests can inform decisions about the significant\npossibility of significant harm with respect to ecological harm and land contamination under Part\nIIA (Department of Environment Transport and the Regions 2000a). Ecological risk assessment\nmust focus on the determination of ecological harm measured by ecological effects from\ncontaminant mixtures. Ecosystem function is largely dependent on soil processes and therefore\nfunction - for which earthworms are surrogate model organisms - represents a viable measure of\necological harm. This concept has not been widely applied to ecological risk assessment and it\nrequires further development.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors wish to thank the two peer reviewers in providing helpful comments.\nREFERENCES\nAchazi RK 2002.
