The key question is the role of place or \nsite in the poem in general terms, and the more specific issue of land. The essay \nfirst analyses three significant sites in the narrative\u2014the locations of the battles \nbetween Beowulf and Grendel, Grendel\u2018s mother and the dragon. Each of these \nplaces\u2014the hall, the mere, and the burial-mound\u2014are shot through with \npowerful emotive, elemental, symbolic and material geographies. Analysis then \nmoves to the politics of land, a resource which is gifted, distributed, disputed and \nfought over. While part of a larger project which seeks to look at the conceptual \nand historical relation between land, terrain and territory, this essay offers a \nmore modest focused study of a single text from a particular period. \n \nLand \u25aa Place \u25aa Elements \u25aa  Old English Literature \n \nIntroduction \n \nThe Old English poem Beowulf has been receiving a great deal of popular \nattention in recent years.1 Long the scourge of English undergraduates, the \nrecent cinematic adaptations, notably the 2007 version directed by Robert \nZemeckis and authored by Neil Gaiman, have brought the story to a whole new \naudience.2 If that film, and other adaptations, take great licence with the story, \nthe more literary merits have also been discussed in the wake of Seamus \nHeaney\u2018s verse translation of 1999.3 Whatever the problems of the films in terms \nof the story, or Heaney\u2018s supposed errors of, or interpretations in place of, \n 2 \ntranslation,4 they have undoubtedly raised the profile of a difficult and \nproblematic text. \n \nThe concern here is with what Beowulf can tell us of the politics of land and the \nsymbolism of place.5 This focus is one that has a solid textual basis and historical \npurpose. The last book of Nicholas Howe, a renowned medievalist, is entitled \nWriting the Map of Anglo-Saxon England and bears the subtitle Essays in Cultural \nGeography.6 In this book, Howe makes the claim that \u2015Beowulf is profoundly a \nwork about place\u2016.7 Although Howe makes a number of suggestions about how \nthat might be the case, the analysis is of some very particular passages, rather \nthan the poem as a whole. Indeed, while his claim concerns place in general \nterms, the explicit analysis, as will be discussed later, is of the notion of e\u00feel, \nhomeland. Here, in distinction, the focus is not just on places as sites, but on \ntheir political aspects, the question of land.8 While there have been a number of \nimportant monographs and edited collections looking at geography and space \ngenerally in the middle ages in recent years,9 with some exceptions this is not a \nperiod that has received much attention from geographers.10  \n \nIn taking Beowulf as the focus here the interest is thus as much with the \nindications of the text as with its literary merits. In a pioneering piece of \nscholarship in 1936 Tolkien made a convincing argument that \u2015so far from being \na poem so poor that only its accidental historical interest can still recommend it, \nBeowulf is in fact so interesting as poetry, in places poetry so powerful, that this \nquite overshadows the historical content\u2016.11 While this may be true, the text does \noffer some very valuable insights into the particular politics of land that can be \nfound in the period of the early Middle Ages, sometimes known as the Dark \nAges. \n \nCaution is of course necessary, for as Earl suggests: \n \n 3 \nThough the world is not a text, Beowulf certainly is. It is only a \nmap and not the world itself. The most fundamental error in \nliterary criticism is to mistake the map for the territory\u2014in this \ncase, Beowulf for the world of Germania, Scandinavia, or Anglo-\nSaxon England.12  \n \nNonetheless, even he suggests that \u2015the best evidence we have for \nunderstanding early Germanic society is Beowulf itself, but its vision is idealized, \narchaic, anachronistic, and only partial\u2016.13 For Girvan the assessment is even \nmore positive: \u2015it has been set alongside Tacitus as witness of the Germanic \nperiod, and it is not surprising for it is the most important Germanic document in \nextent and character which we possess\u2016.14 It is one of the earliest surviving \nworks of English literature, or indeed in any northern European vernacular \nlanguage. \n \nThe reading offered here tries to steer a way through these ambiguities. It does \nnot try to suggest that lessons from Beowulf can tell us anything particularly \nconcrete about those places that are mentioned in the text. Many editions of \nBeowulf have a map of its geography at the beginning, showing the Geats in \nwhat is today southern Sweden, the Swedes and the Heathoreams to the North, \nand the Danes in the Zealand area of modern Denmark. The Old English G\u0113at is \noften taken to be the equivalent of the modern Swedish G\u00f6t, that is the region of \nG\u00f6taland, and the historical tribe of the G\u00f6tar, who lived in that region.15 Various \nother tribes are loosely distributed across northern Germany, Poland, and the low \ncountries, and the modern village of Lejre, near Roskilde, is often given as the \nlocation of Heorot.16 While some of this work is valuable, an attempt to find a \nhistorical basis for the sites of the events is not the purpose of this essay.17 Nor \ndoes it seek to generalise from what insights there are in the text that can be \ntied to archaeological evidence.18 Rather, the interest is in the particularly \n 4 \nsymbolic and exchange geographies implied and presented in the poem itself, \nwhich are themselves intensely material. \n \nIn this sense it is closer to one of Tolkien\u2018s other insights: \n \nThe significance of a myth is not easily to be pinned on paper by \nanalytical reasoning. It is at its best when it is presented by a poet \nwho feels rather than makes explicit what his theme portends: who \npresents it incarnate in the world of history and geography.19 \n \nThus the focus here is on the text itself; its story, history and geography. A brief \nsummary of the original story is in order, before the analysis begins, not least \nbecause of the changes made in recent better-known adaptations. A great mead-\nhall has been built named Heorot, where Hrothgar rules the Danes. The hall is \nattacked by the monster Grendel, a descent of the race of Cain. Beowulf of the \nGeats travels to Heorot and kills the monster with his bare hands. The next night \nthe monster\u2018s mother seeks vengeance; Beowulf pursues her to her lair, and \nslays her too. Beowulf returns home, and in time becomes King of the Geats. \nSome fifty years later, Beowulf\u2018s people are attacked by a dragon. Beowulf meets \nthe dragon in combat, and though he kills it, dies in the battle. Without his \nprotection the Geats are overrun by the Swedes from the north and tribes from \nthe south. \n \nThe reading here proceeds through a number of stages. The text indicates three \nset-piece battles\u2014with Grendel, his mother, and the dragon; but rather less \nnoted are the particular sites at which these take place\u2014the hall, the mere, and \nthe burial-mound. Following readings of these three sites, two more general \nthemes are discussed: gifts of land and conflict over it. Generally then this \nreading offers something different from analyses which focus on themes such as \ndating or its relation to Christianity, or those that follow the poet\u2018s lead and \n 5 \nstress characterisation and narrative. For Orchard, \u2015the sheer number and \nvariety of characters depicted by the Beowulf-poet, when compared with his \ncomparative disinterest in the specifics of place, signals his overarching concern \nfor individuals and their individual perspectives\u2016.20 In distinction here, and in the \ncompany of those referenced in the notes, a range of symbolic and political \nsenses of land are shown to saturate the narrative. \n \nThe Hall \n \nHrothgar\u2018s hall is a centrepiece of his realm, a great mead-hall, a place of \ncelebration. The poet describes this as \u2015a house greater than men on earth ever \nhad heard of\u2016 (70-1). It is not a dwelling place, but a ceremonial and ritual site.21 \nAs Earl suggests: \n \nOriginally, the hall was not primarily a form of habitation; it was a \nme\u00f0elstede, a formal place\u2026 the hall is a house, but it is not \nexactly a home\u2014men drink and talk there, but they do not live \nthere; they do not eat there (a feast is a gebeorscip, a beer-\ndrinking, or a symbel, a ceremonial feast, and there is no mention \nof food), and for the most part they do not sleep there. The hall is \na me\u00f0elstede, a formal place, a ceremonial place, a primitive form \nof court.22 \n \nThe hall is thus a place of repose but also the centrepiece of the community, \nboth social and political. The various descriptions of the hall stress that it is \u2015a \nbeautiful building\u2016 (773); a \u2015splendid timbered hall adorned with gold\u2016 (307-8), \nreinforced by \u2015iron bands of skilful forging inside and out\u2016 (774-5). Inside it is \ndescribed as a \u2015goldhall gleaming with gold plating\u2016 (715-6), with \u2015gold-worked \nmead benches\u2016 (775-6), and later, following the dispatch of the monsters, \u2015gold-\nembroidered tapestries gleamed on the walls\u2016 (994-5). Yet, as Earl notes, it is \n 6 \nabove all \u2015a symbolic and a ritual space\u2016.23 The hall speaks of the power of the \nDanes, of their proud lineage from Scyld Scefing. Yet the hall is threatened \nalmost immediately, it moves very quickly from being \u2015a place of joy and \nsecurity\u2016 to one \u2015threatened by external forces of evil\u2016:24 \n \nThe hall is no sooner built than its burning is foretold. No matter \nhow strong its walls or brilliant its life, we are always aware of its \nfragility and transience. Grendel is Heorot\u2018s shadow.25 \n \nFor the Christian narrator of the poem, who traces Grendel\u2018s lineage to Cain \n(107), the monster is an outcast because he is, or at least descended from, \nevil.26 Yet other interpretations have suggested that it is precisely his exclusion \nthat has turned him to vengeance. This exclusion is both geographical and \nfamilial. Excluded from the hall and all that it symbolises, particularly celebration \nand order, he enters to disrupt the proceedings, spurred on by the noise of \nfestivities (85-90). Cain, of course, was a farmer until he killed his brother, a \nshepherd. Among other things, his punishment was exile (see 109). Grendel\u2018s \nparentage is the subject of some ambiguity. While his mother makes a powerful \nappearance later in the poem, his father is unknown (1355), and it is through the \nmother that he is descended from Cain (107, 1260-62).27 Given the importance \nof patrimony, and the denial of a birth-right and inheritance, this makes further \nsense of the exclusion. For Orchard, \u2015family relationships are everything in this \nclose-knit text, which shows a keen interest both in blood-lines and (especially) \nin kings\u2016.28 Indeed, while Grendel\u2018s original assaults are the product of \u2015the \nspiteful response of a lordless man to his exclusion from the life of the hall\u2016, the \nsubsequent attack of his mother \u2015is sheer vengeance for her kin\u2016.29 \n \nGrendel lives in darkness [\u00deystrum] (87), and comes to Heorot at night (115). \nThis gives rise to his common designation as a troll, a monster that traditionally \nshuns the light.30 His carnage is fully seen with the \u2015dawn\u2018s light\u2016 (126), and the \n 7 \npoet directly opposes the \u2015night\u2018s feasting\u2016 with the \u2015morning\u2018s lamentation\u2016 \n(128-9). The next night brings new terrors (135-6). Grendel described as the \n\u2015dark shadow of death [deorc d\u0113a\u00descua] (160). On the night of his fight with \nBeowulf, the King retires just as \u2015darkness drowns everything and under its \nshadow-cover shapes do glide dark beneath the clouds\u2016 (649-51), and soon \n\u2015gliding through the dark night came the walker in the shadows\u2016 (702-3). As \nBeowulf attacks him, and he realises he has met a powerful foe, he is \u2015eager to \nget away\u2016 and \u2015ails for the darkness\u2016 (755). It is thus significant that the attacks \nby Grendel, and, later, his mother are made at night, but they are launched from \ntheir watery abode, and so on the one hand the Beowulf poet establishes the \nopposition of day\/night, but simultaneously complicates any straight-forward \ndistinction between earth and water. Grendel\u2018s dwelling place will be discussed in \nthe next section, but for the moment it suffices to note that Grendel comes in \nfrom the \u2015misty moors [mistige m\u014dras]\u2016 in the \u2015endless night\u2016 (161-62); and \nwalks the \u2015misty slopes of the moors\u2016 (710). The figure of the mist, or the fog, is \nwater over land; either coming in directly from the sea, or from marshes or \notherwise boggy land. It is thus a blurring of boundaries, across the liminal zone \nof the moors, a mixing of water and earth, and thus prefigures the attacks.31 \n \nIt is further worth noting Tolkien\u2018s insight that, despite his monstrosity, \u2015Grendel \ninhabits the visible world and eats the flesh and blood of men; he enters their \nhouses by the doors\u2016.32 Grendel is a monster on the edge of this world, \n\u2015haunting the borders of human society, he is always present, neither in nor fully \nout of it\u2016.33 Through his attacks the order of the hall is replaced with the disorder \nof nature, a representation of the general chaotic order of life, which the poem \ncommunicates as continually surrounding the human outposts. As Earl notes \u2015the \nstorm and ocean are conventional symbols of this chaos\u2016. As he continues, \n\u2015others are the ruined hall, the fen and the battlefield)\u2016.34 In all of these the \nstability of rock and earth is replaced with other elemental forces, notably the \nwaters of the storm and sea, but also crucially the opening of the hall to the \n 8 \nelements, the fen as an admixture of water and earth, and the battlefield where \nblood is split. Hrothgar\u2018s description of the hall after Grendel\u2018s assault is \ninstructive, since it is in a sense more concerned with the despoliation of the \nplace than of the people: \u2015in the morning this noble hall was blood-stained, \nblood had drenched its shining benches, the battle-gore in the hall\u2016 (484-87). \nThis hall is not simply the site of battle, but its stake: Grendel is described as \nholding sway or ruling over [rixode] the hall until Beowulf arrives (144). \nBeowulf\u2018s task is to reclaim it. \n \nThis clash between elements is well indicated by Tolkien\u2018s invocation of the \nfamous phrase h\u00e6le\u00f0 under heofenum (52), which  \n \nMay have meant in dictionary terms \u2017heroes under heaven\u2018 or \n\u2017mighty men upon earth\u2018, but he and his hearers were thinking of \nthe eormengrund, the great earth, ringed with garsecg, the \nshoreless sea, beneath the sky\u2018s inaccessible roof\u2026 That even this \n\u2017geography\u2018, once held as a material fact, could now be classed as \na mere folk-tale affects its value very little.35 \n \nGrendel\u2019s Mere \n \nAs Grendel flees the mead-hall, leaving behind the arm Beowulf has wrenched \nfrom his body, he is already dying. He heads back to his lair, a place which had \nbeen earlier described as \u2015the wasteland, the fen and fastnesses\u2016 (103-4). While \nin Christian imagery it has resonances of hell,36 the more potent image is the \nintrusion of water into the solid earth. While there is certainly an opposition \nbetween monstrosity and humanity, barbarism and culture, with wasteland \nopposed to cultivated land, there is more than this. In the figure of water the \npoet is conjuring up the horrors of the sea\u2014there are many references to sea-\nmonsters in the poem\u2014and the \u2015diseases of the pestilent marshes\u2016.37 It is \n 9 \nboggy, marshy land, something that is far more dangerous and intrinsically \nterrifying than either land or sea alone. Grendel himself is explicitly described as \na mearcstapa, a march-stepper or border-wanderer (103), one who expelled \nfrom humankind had made a home with sea-creatures (105-108). When he \nleaves Heorot, dying, he is described as a water-monster (nicor) heading back to \nhis mere (845). The water of the brim into which he has dived in his death-\nthroes, surges and bubbles, mixed with blood and battle-gore (847-49). \n \nBy the time there is a discussion of visiting this second site the quarry is \nGrendel\u2018s mother, who had attacked the hall in vengeance for her son\u2018s death. \nNow both she and Grendel are described as mearcstapan, march-steppers, who \ntrod \u2015the path of exile\u2016 (1348-1352). Dispatching the mother will put an end to \nher line, thus truly ending Heorot\u2018s problems. At this point their lair is the topic of \na remarkable description, first by Hrothgar (1357-1379), and then by the \nnarrator (1408-17).38 The lair is close to Heorot\u2014\u2015it is not far from here \nmeasured in miles [m\u012blgemearces]\u2016 (1361b-1362b)\u2014but figuratively remote. One \nof the things that is significant about this encounter is that it is not simply with a \nmonster\u2014the mother\u2014but in a monstrous place as well\u2014the mere. The \ndescription of the mere by Hrothgar is, as many have noted, powerful in its \nimagery, but problematic.  \n \nThe passage as a whole is worth reading: \n \nThey inhabit a mysterious land [lond], wolf-haunted slopes, windy \nheadlands, gruesome fen-paths where a mountain torrent goes \ndown dark cliffs and plunges under the earth. It is not far from \nhere, by the measure of miles, that the mere stands forth. Over it \nhang groves hoary with frost; a crag-rooted trees overshadow the \nwater. There, each night, can be seen a fearful wonder: fire on the \nflood. Of the sons of men there does not live one old and wise \n 10 \nenough to know the bottom. Though the heath-stepper, pressed by \nhounds, the hart strong of antler, will hide in the forest, chased \nfrom long, rather will he give his life on the bank, rather than go in \nthe water to save his head; that is not a pleasant place. Thence the \nsurging waves rise up, dark, to the skies when the wind stirs, awful \nstorms, until the air becomes gloomy, the heavens weep (1357b-\n76a). \n \nThis is certainly clear, though the full richness of the imagery and word play of \nthe description is not easily rendered into modern English. The key point of \ndispute is, however, what the mere is, a question evaded here by leaving the \nterm untranslated. In the literature there is a issue as to whether it is a part of \nthe sea or an inland pool.39 While many accounts stress the sea part, perhaps as \na kind of lagoon or estuary, others insist that the moor-setting implies a land-\nlocked body of water. Crucial is the blurring of a usually clear boundary. The \nterm brim is a word which usually refers to the sea, and some relation to at least \npartly open waters seems more likely.40 One of those who takes the inland water \ninterpretation is Alain Renoir, who renders mere as a pond. Nonetheless, his \ngeneral point is helpful: \n \nOnly three statements in the passage fail to evoke a sharply \ndelineated image: the mention of the proximity of the Pond \n(1361b-62b), the assertion that no man has explored the bottom of \nthe Pond (1366b-67b). and the conclusion that the Pond is not a \nsafe place (1372b).41  \n \nWhile Renoir is correct that all the other statements imply a particular place \n[st\u014dw], even these three statements are profoundly geographical, invoking the \ndistance, depth and safety of this uncanny or unhappy, or perilous place (1372, \n1378).42 One of the reasons for the nature of this place is its geographical \n 11 \nconfusion or monstrosity as much as its monstrous inhabitants. For Orchard \u2015the \ngeography of the place\u2026 is exceedingly hard to reconcile\u2016,43 and for Lawrence \n\u2015the descriptions of the haunted pool are hopelessly inconsistent\u2016.44 This has \ncreated much work for the critics. Lawrence suggests that this inconsistency is \ndue to textual corruption and emendation: \n \nThe descriptions of the haunted mere reveal three conceptions of \nits nature and location: (1) in the moor or fen, (2) in high and \nrocky land, (3) in or near the sea; that it is impossible to reconcile \nall these so as to give a single consistent picture of natural scenery; \nand that in view of mutually contradictory elements appearing \nelsewhere in Beowulf, and in other epics, it is most reasonable to \nassume that different conceptions were here amalgamated, despite \ntheir unlikeness, in the usual course of epic evolution.45 \n \nThis is to explain the problem through philological error. But this may be in part \ndeliberate by the poet. As Malone notes,  \n \nWe have seen that Grendel\u2018s abode or, rather, his realm centers on \na body of water represented as part of the ocean\u2026 The approach \nto this body of water must be made through a desolation where \nearth and water are mysteriously mingled: a great marsh inhabited \nby monsters and beast of prey\u2026 This investigation has proceeded \non the assumption that the Beowulf poet\u2018s description of Grendel\u2018s \nabode is worthy of study in its own right and that its qualities can \nand should be brought out within the limits of the poet\u2018s own \nmilieu.46 \n \nIt seems that this interpretation is more in keeping with the careful balance kept \nbetween earth and water imagery by the poet. In the ocean, as compared to \n 12 \nsolid land, there is a clear separation, yet the geography of Grendel\u2018s abode \ncomplicates this. Marshes are where the water intrudes into the earth, \ntreacherous and desolate; marginal areas. One indicator of this is the description \nof the stag as a h\u00e6\u00f0stapa, a heath-stepper (1368), thus recalling Grendel the \nmarsh-stepper [mearcstapa] (108).47 The stag, of course, refuses to take to the \nmere at all, preferring to cross the boundary of life to death than the one from \ndry land to the water. Beowulf however, has long proved himself to be adept in \nthe sea as much as the land. The poem is filled with boasts about his prowess in \nthe sea. These include Beowulf\u2018s claim to have \u2015crushed on the wave sea-\nserpents by night\u2016 (421-22), the swimming match with Breca (506ff), the \njourney over the sea\u2014the \u2015swan\u2018s road\u2016 (200)\u2014to Heorot\u2018s rescue, and his \nescape from the battle of Friesland by swimming the ocean (2359-60). \n \nBeowulf is, here, an exemplar of the people at the time: able to traverse \nconsiderable distances by sea. Hrothgar is, on the contrary, somewhat strangely \nand unlike his forebears, resolutely shore bound, even land-locked. Irving has \nmade much of the symbolic resonances of the landscape described by the King \nof the Danes.48 As Robinson characterises this reading: \u2015his imagination has \nbeen so captured by the horrors that face him, and in describing a landscape so \nsad and menacing that it seems to have a soul Hrothgar is in fact displaying the \ndesolate landscape of his own mind\u2016.49 In making this description Hrothgar is \nthrowing down a further, only slightly veiled, challenge to Beowulf. This is one \nthat the latter is eager to take up, vowing that he will pursue Grendel\u2018s m\u0101ge, his \nkinswoman, the mother. \u2015She shall not disappear under darkness, neither in the \nbosom of the earth, nor in the mountain wood, nor to the bottom of the sea, \nwherever she goes\u2016 (1392-4). As Orchard notes: \n \nImmediately following this vow, which might be seen as a purely \nrhetorical outburst, Beowulf is soon to take his pursuit literally \nunderground, beneath mountain-forests, and on the sea-bed in his \n 13 \nrelentless search for Grendel\u2018s mother into her lair, which this \npromise neatly (if perhaps from Beowulf\u2018s own view, \nunintentionally) describes.50 \n \nWhen they reach the mere, a home of sea-monsters [nicorh\u016bs] (1411), once \nmore the water is mixed with blood, this time of the retainer who had been \nseized by the mother the previous day. The poet invokes \u2015strange sea-dragons \n[sellice s\u00e6dracan]\u2026 water-monsters [nicor]\u2026 serpents and wildbeasts\u2016 (1426-\n1430). Beowulf alone dives into the mere, but it is some time before he can see \nthe ground at the bottom (1495-6).51 Once in the lair, Beowulf struggles with the \nmother, and other weird creatures [wundra] and sea-beasts (1509-10). He is \ndragged to a place that again mixes the elements\u2014a dry cave lit by a fiery light, \nbut deep under water (1515-16). Having no name but Grendel\u2018s mother, the \npoet continually finds ways to describe her\u2014\u2015she-wolf of the water [brimwylf]\u2016 \n(1506, 1599); and \u2015worm of the deep, sea-woman [grundwyrgenne, merew\u012bf]\u2016 \n(1518-19)\u2014that stress her monstrosity, femininity and aquatic nature in equal \nmeasure. She had apparently \u2015been doomed to dwell in the fearsome waters in \nthe chilling currents\u2016 because of her kinship with Cain (1259-61). Beowulf \nengages in a fight with the mother, ending with her death.52 Once again blood \nbubbles to the surface of the mere (1592-94), and Beowulf\u2018s retainers fear that it \nis his. Beowulf returns to Hrothgar to gain his reward, and then takes his leave \nof the Danes. \n \nThe Dragon\u2019s Lair \n \nOn returning to the land of the Geats, and ascending the throne, Beowulf rules \nfor many years. When he is again called to action against a monster it is a \ndragon. The lair of the dragon, in contrast to the mere, is resolutely land-based, \nindeed it is a burial mound filled with treasure.53 The first description is of it as a \nst\u0101nbeorh, a stonebarrow (2113). We are told that the treasure house is \u2015in the \n 14 \nearth [on hr\u016bsan]\u2016 (2278), that it is a \u2015earth-hall [eor\u00f0sele]\u2026 a grave under \nground [hl\u00e6w under hr\u016bsan]\u2016 (2410-11). It is a tomb or a grave [hl\u00e6w] (2296, \n2773), in a barrow [beorh] (2241), which Lawrence suggests \u2015may be either a \nnatural hill or elevation, or an artificial mound or tumulus\u2016, but which here is \n\u2015clearly of the artificial variety\u2016.54 The hl\u00e6w is sometimes simply the grave, and \nsometimes the mound or barrow itself.55 Inside the mound is an \u2015earthen hall \nwith stone arches based on pillars\u2016 (2718-19). The burial mound is therefore \ninteresting, and geographically ambiguous, since it is both above the earth\u2014soil \nheaped over bodies and treasures\u2014and below the newly created surface. The \ntreasure was left by a warrior (2231-70), or by tribal chiefs (3047-75); the poem \nis contradictory on this point. The hoard is cursed (3052-57), and the dragon is \nenraged because a thief has sought to plunder the treasure hoard, and so seeks \nvengeance. Somewhat in distinction to Grendel\u2014excluded from the hearth\u2014but \nlike his mother\u2014acting in vengeance for her son\u2014the dragon too is provoked to \naction. With the dragon, it is the violation of a place that is the spur. Yet it is not \nsimply the Geats who suffer from the curse, for the dragon too dies, despite \nkilling Beowulf in the process. \n \nLike Grendel and his mother the dragon attacks only at night, and, like them, he \nis an \u2015elemental, primeval\u2016 enemy.56 Yet the elemental conflict is somewhat \ndifferent. The dragon\u2018s targets are Beowulf\u2018s people, the Geats, a proud sea-\nfaring race who inhabit coastal lands. Their hall is on a sea-cliff (1924), and \nBeowulf\u2018s eventual tomb will be a \u2015mound on the headland\u2016 that could be seen \nby sailors (3156-68). Indeed the parallel between the dragon\u2018s lair and Beowulf\u2018s \nfuture tomb is hard to escape: with almost his dying breath Beowulf asks Wiglaf \nto go underground, to examine the treasure hoard, \u2015beneath the grey stone\u2016 \n(2743-4). Rather than a challenge from the sea then, the Geats are challenged \nby the weapon of fire and through the medium of air. Among many descriptions, \nthe poet tells us that \u2015the fire-dragon\u2018s flames blasted the coastal land and \npeople\u2018s stronghold\u2016 (2333-5). Yet as well as being described as a fire-dragon\u2014\n 15 \nl\u012bgdraca (2333, see 3040) or fyrdraca (2689)\u2014it is also named as a eor\u00f0draca, \nan earth-dragon (2712, 2825), and a w\u012bdfloga, literally a wide-flyer (2830).  \n \nThe barrow and dragon thus show another dimension to the geographies of the \npoem, showing the verticality of volume rather simply areas or surfaces. Like the \ndescent into the mere it highlights the importance of what is below the surface, \nthe subsoil, and the flight demonstrates the significance of the air, what is above \nthe ground. Significantly the dwellings of all the monsters in the poem are \nunderground, those of the humans above it.57 Yet fire, earth and air all appear to \nbe the dragon\u2018s element. Only water appears to be outside. Indeed, although the \ndragon\u2018s barrow is close to the crashing sea waves (2241-2, 2411-2), its dead \nbody is eventually pushed off the cliff into the sea (3131-33).  \n \nGifts of Land  \n \nThese three sites are thus given detailed descriptions, mixing elemental, \nsymbolic and material geographies. Yet, crucial though they are to the drama of \nthe poem, the question of land exceeds these particular sites, as it can be seen \nto be a significant theme throughout. In the Anglo-Saxon Maxims, the aphorism \n\u2015holding land he is hated, giving much he is much loved\u2016 is sometimes seen as \nindicative of land-politics of the period.58 In Beowulf the Christian poet suggests \nthat God: \n \nDistributes wisdom, land [eard] and nobility [eorlscipe] among \nmankind\u2026 he will grant him earth\u2018s bliss in his native land [\u0113\u00dele], \nthe sway of the stronghold of his people, and will give him to rule \nregions [d\u00e6las] of the world, broad realms [rice]: he cannot \nimagine, in his folly, than an end will come (1725-34). \n \n 16 \nHowever in Beowulf there are two rather distinct economies at work. The first is \nthe distributive politics of Hrothgar. We are told at the beginning of the poem \nthat Hrothgar was going to distribute \u2015the gifts God had given him\u2026 apart from \ncommon land [folcscaru] and lives\u2016 (73-74). While the second exception is \nsupposed to show that he is no tyrant, the former\u2014while certainly open to that \ninterpretation\u2014indicates something more. That is supported by his actions later \nin the narrative. \n \nAfter the death of Grendel, Hrothgar showers Beowulf and his retainers with \ngifts, and even names him as his son, but the Queen intervenes to ensure that \nthe realm itself passes to her sons. The speech is notable, since though this is a \npatriarchal society, she still has an important role as the reproducer of a line:  \n \nHeorot is cleansed, the ring-hall gleams again: therefore bestow \nwhile you may these blessings generously, and leave to your \nkinsmen the realm and its people [folc und r\u012bce] when your passing \nis decreed (1176-1180).  \n \nHrothgar follows his Queen\u2018s advice, and does not skimp on the treasures, while \nreserving any gifts of land. Even after the end of Grendel\u2018s mother, and \nBeowulf\u2018s departure from the Danes, Hrothgar presents him with twelve new \ntreasures, and Beowulf departs \u2015proudly gold-adorned [goldwlanc]\u2016 (1881). But \nhe does leave, retaining no ties to that land other than friendship and loyalty. \nWhen Beowulf returns to the Geats, he in turn presents the treasures to the \nKing, Hygelac, his maternal uncle (2145-62). \n \nHygelac receives these gifts with pleasure, and then reciprocates. Alongside \nHygelac\u2018s father Hrethel\u2018s sword, which is given to Beowulf, the gift of land then \ncomes from this King: \n \n 17 \nHe bestowed on him seven thousand hides of land, a princely \nthrone and a hall. Inherited land, a domain by birthright, had come \ndown to them both in the Geat nation; ancestral domain, the \ngreater realm [rice] to the  higher born of them (2195-2199).59 \n \nVery quickly, a matter of lines later in the poem, Beowulf inherits the \u2015broad \nrealm [rice]\u2016 of Hygelac\u2018s lands when he is slain (2207-8). Somewhat later in the \npoem the full story is told. Hygelac\u2018s widow offers Beowulf \u2015hoard and realm \n[rice], rings and a princely throne\u2016, because she does not trust that her son is \nstrong enough to repel foreign invasion. Beowulf refuses this honour, staying \nmerely as an advisor and ally, until the son himself is killed, \u2015which allowed \nBeowulf to hold the princely throne and rule the Geats\u2016 (2389-90). In these \npassages there are two key things stressed: land through inheritance on death, \nand land through gift. While Beowulf owned land by birthright he is given the \nseven thousand hides before Hygelac dies, only inheriting the balance later. \nElsewhere we are told Hygelac made a gift of \u2015land and linked rings worth a \nhundred thousand\u2016 to the retainers Eofor and Wulf for their deeds in battle \nagainst the Swedes (2989-90).60 \n \nMuch later, when Beowulf has been king for many years, the death of Hrethel\u2014\nHygelac\u2018s father and Beowulf\u2018s grandfather\u2014is recounted as a prelude to the war \nbetween the Swedes and the Geats, but also as a prelude to Beowulf\u2018s own \nimminent demise. It is also mentioned in terms of inheritance. We are told \nHrethel \u2015left to his sons his land and towns at his life\u2018s faring forth, as the \nfortunate man does\u2016 (2469-71). Beowulf adds that he was able to repay Hygelac \nin battle \u2015for the treasures he had given me. He had given me land, dwelling and \ndelight in homeland [eard \u0113\u00f0elwyn] to leave to my heirs\u2016 (2492-3). In addition, \nwhen Beowulf does confront the dragon, and all his companions flee, the one \nwho returns is Wiglaf. Of all the favours he remembers from Beowulf, to whom \nhe owes allegiance, he explicitly recalls \u2015the wealthy dwelling-place of the \n 18 \nWaymundings, confirming him in the common landrights his father had held\u2016 \n(2606-08). Here then it is not so much the gift of land, but the support for the \nproperty rights of the commons that is important. \n \nOn Beowulf\u2018s death, lacking an heir, things are more complicated. Wiglaf tells \nthem that because too few came to Beowulf\u2018s aid, \n \nNow there shall cease for your race the receiving of treasure, the \ngiving of swords, all satisfaction of ownership, all comfort of home \n[e\u00f0elwyn]. Each of your kin [cynne] shall become wanderers \nwithout land-rights as soon as athelings over the world shall hear \nthe report of how you fled, a deed of ill fame (2884-90). \n \nThis comes to pass, but not quite in the way anticipated. It is less because of a \nloss of prestige, than because with the death of Beowulf his overseas enemies \nbecome emboldened (see 2910-15). \n \nConflict over Land \n \nAs well as these senses of distribution, the word \u2017land\u2018\u2014an English word directly \nlinked to the Old English land, lond\u2014has multiple meanings. Many of these are \nindicated in the poem. Land can be used in a straight-forward, unstressed sense, \nin opposition to sea, such as when sailors sight or make land at the end of a \nvoyage (221, 1913), or when Beowulf surfaces from the mere after the fight with \nGrendel\u2018s mother (1623). It can be limited or marked, with a boundary, although \nhere that is only used of the coastline [landgemyrcu] (209). It can be used in a \nway that means little more than place, such as the \u2015mysterious land\u2016 Grendel \nand his mother inhabit (1357), or with a sense of region, speaking of the \nstrongest in a land (2836), or the people of a land (2310). It can be plural, with \nHrothgar\u2018s hall having a \u2015radiance that shone over many lands\u2016 (311). It can also \n 19 \nbe an advantage, in that someone \u2015knowing the land well\u2016 might \u2015escape with \nhis life\u2016 (2062).61  \n \nYet even concerning distribution, \u2017land\u2018 is used not simply to designate the \nproperty of a person or a King, such as Scyld Scefing being hailed as the \n\u2015beloved leader of the land [l\u0113of landfruma]\u2016 (31), but also of a people more \ngenerally. The land of the Danes [land Dena] is mentioned when Beowulf arrives \non his quest against Grendel (242, 253), and again when they depart (1904). \nWhen Beowulf is recounting his swimming contest with Breca, for instance, he \nclaims that the sea currents carried him \u2015to the land of the Lapps [on Finna \nland]\u2016 (580). There are other examples in the poem\u2014the land of the Brondings \n(521) and the land of the Frisians (2915). It is this sense of land and its relation \nto a people that is the topic of this last section, for it leads to the question of \nconflict over this resource, both as the object and terrain of struggle. \n \nHowe notes that \u2015Anglo-Saxons conceived of the land itself and all that grew on \nit as more enduring than anything human beings could build on it and thus as \nmore useful for legal purposes\u2016.62 While he does not pursue all the resonances of \nthe term within the poem, he does offer an important illustration of his earlier-\ncited claim that it \u2015profoundly a work about place\u2016.63 Howe shows how the \n\u2015breakneck chronology\u2016 of lines 2200-2214, discussed above, is \u2015a political \ngenealogy\u2026 [a] dynastic progression\u2016, showing the passage from Hygelac to \nHeardred to Beowulf, but that this is not simply a line of kings, but establishes \nthe land they rule over: \u2015these lines from Beowulf clearly demarcate a kingdom \nby offering its line of dynastic succession\u2016.64 He suggests that the poem is in part \n\u2015a political poem that asks what it means to be an e\u00deelweard\u2016, a guardian of the \nhomeland, \u2015then it must also be a poem about place, about the meaning of \ne\u00deel\u2016.65  \n \n 20 \nThe poet uses e\u00deel, homeland, and rice, kingdom or realm throughout the poem, \noften juxtaposed with no clear distinction. A prince\u2018s son, for instance \u2015should \nprosper, succeed to his father\u2018s rank, guard the people, treasure-hoard and \nstronghold, the realm [rice] of heroes, homeland [e\u00f0el] of the Scyldings\u2016 (910-\n3). Alongside the use of e\u00deelweard, Beowulf describes Hrothgar as \u2015rice weard\u2016, \nguardian or ward of the realm (1390), and there are a couple of instances where \nHrothgar or Beowulf are described as a rices hyrde, which effectively means the \nsame thing (2027, 3080). What is intriguing, Howe suggests, is that there are \nonly two instances of the verb ricsian, derived from rice, which means to rule. \nBut these are not used of humans. It is used to describe the dragon ruling over \nthe hoard (2211), and earlier, of Grendel effectively ruling over the hall until \nBeowulf arrives (144). In both instances a monstrous rule is opposed to a heroic \nleadership of the homeland\u2014in the case of the dragon the lines in the poem \ncome immediately after the invocation of Beowulf\u2018s role as e\u00deelweard (2210).66  \n \nWhen dying, Beowulf recalls that he has ruled his people for fifty winters, and \nthat in that time \u2015not a single king of all the neighbouring peoples \n[ymbesittendra] about has dared to affront me with his friends in war or threaten \nterrors\u2016 (2733-2736). Yet the whole of the second part of the poem\u2014that is, \nBeowulf\u2018s return to the Geats, the death of Hygelac and the passing of the realm \nto Beowulf\u2014concerns three key things: the fight with the dragon; the war \nbetween the Geats and the Swedes; and unrest on the southern borders.67 \nThese stories are continually intertwined, so that on Beowulf\u2018s death in combat \nwith the dragon it is not surprising that the full force of the other conflicts are \nunleashed: the poet has continually prefigured it. \n \nBeowulf\u2018s predecessor as King, Hygelac, had actually died in an ill-fated raid on \nthe southern tribes of the Frisians and the Franks. We are told that \u2015fate carried \nhim off when, out of pride, he went looking for trouble, a feud with the Frisians\u2016 \n(1205-07). It is from this battle that Beowulf escapes by swimming away (2359-\n 21 \n60). Jack and Swanton note that there is historical evidence for the battle and \ndeath of Hygelac, at least, in Gregory of Tours\u2018 Historia Francorum, and the \nGesta Francorum.68 As Mitchell and Robinson put it, switching back to the poetic, \nrather than historical, narrative: \n \nThis disaster so weakened the Geatish nation that only the \npresence of mighty Beowulf on the throne could keep surrounding \nenemies at bay, and so when he dies the nation (we are told \nrepeatedly) is doomed. This being the case, each of the four times \nthat the Frisian raid is recounted (II. 1202-14, 2354-66, 2501-8, \n2913-21) is a reminder of the baleful future awaiting the Geats.69  \n \nYet this is a conflict that has been going on for some time.70 Recounting the \nhistory of his line, Beowulf recalls that it was after the death of Hrethel, \nHygelac\u2018s father, that \u2015there was hostility and strife between Swedes and Geats, \na mutual grievance across the broad water\u2016 (2472-74). Yet Hygelac makes this \nworse by inflaming tensions to the south too, with the Frisians and the Franks, \nthus presenting the Geats with a war on two fronts. On Beowulf\u2018s death, Wiglaf \nrecognises that \u2015the people can expect a period of conflict, once the fall of the \nking becomes openly known abroad among Franks and Frisians\u2016 (2910-13). A \nfew lines later, having offered a detailed account of the stages up to this point, \nWiglaf notes that \u2015this is the feud and the enmity, deadly hatred of men, for \nwhich I expect the people of the Swedes to come looking for us, once they hear \nthat our lord has lost his life\u2016 (2999-3003). The loss of the king, cyning, produces \na vulnerability for his kin, cynn; the absence of the e\u00deelweard or riceweard \nremoves the protection from the homeland and realm.71 As Earl puts it: \n\u2015Beowulf\u2018s death will release tremendous, deeply rooted forces waiting to engulf \nhis world. His successful kingship has only been a holding action against this \nchaos\u2016.72 In this the geopolitical conflict parallels Beowulf\u2018s previous three battles \nwith monsters: holding the forces of disorder at bay from a human world of \n 22 \npockets of isolated order. And yet the poem continually insists on the \ninterrelation, and the crossing between such arbitrary borders.73 What happens \nwith Beowulf\u2018s death is that a much wider world intrudes: distance and proximity \nare reordered. \n \nConclusion \n \nThe claims of this essay are necessarily modest. It does not seek to generalise \nfrom what the poet tells us, but rather to set it out and show the force of his \nallusion and argument. In the first part of the poem, Beowulf confronts two \nmonsters, Grendel and his mother, in two distinct places, the hall and the mere. \nElemental conflicts between earth and sea, and in particular their problematic \nintermingling, shape the narrative. In the second part he gains the throne of the \nGeats, who are beset by external enemies. Losing his life in a final struggle with \na dragon, Beowulf leaves a realm behind that has little future left. The Swedes, \noff-stage for most of the poem, begin to encroach. In all this, the essay provides \na much more detailed account of a claim Heaney makes in his introduction to the \npoem. \n \nThe Swedish dimension gradually becomes an important element in \nthe poem\u2018s emotional and imaginative geography, a geography that \nentails, it should be said, no very clear map-sense of the world, \nmore an apprehension of menaced borders, of danger gathering \nbeyond the mere and the marshes, of mearc-stapas \u2017prowling the \nmoors, huge marauders \/ from some other world.74 \n \nThe \u2015emotional and imaginative geography\u2016, important though it is, needs to be \nbalanced with the land-politics and geopolitics discussed in the last two sections \nof this essay. The poem does not have a \u2015very clear map-sense of the world\u2016, \nbut rather a much more narrow focus on immediate geographies. Looking at the \n 23 \nuse of language here does provide a great deal of illustration of the \nunderstandings of place and land, and their relation to politics and the people. \nWhile part of a larger project which seeks to look at the conceptual and historical \nrelation between land, terrain and territory, this essay offers a more focused \nstudy of a single text from a particular period. \n \nIn this text, site and place are given a range of symbolic, material and emotive \nresonances. Land, as an indicator of a set of relations that mix economic and \npolitical concerns, is the operative geographical question. The interrelation of the \npeople with the land they inhabit is a key theme. \u2017Territory\u2018 is a much later \ncategory that does not make any sense in the period and place of Beowulf.75  \nSometimes, though barely hinted at in the poem, land becomes a political-\nstrategic rather than simply political-economic question, which implies what we \nmight think through the question of \u2017terrain\u2018. Terrain is, of course, itself a \ncomplicated term with a distinct etymology and lineage to that of land, and it is a \nterm which is strictly speaking foreign to this text. But the interrelation of the site \nand stake of struggle is important: land is not simply where battles take place, \nbut often the focus of the struggle itself. This text thus gives a partial glimpse of \nthe political-strategic issue alongside its very particular political economy of land. \nThough he was speaking of Greek tragedy, Marx might as well have been \nspeaking of all epic poetry when he asked if their \u2015conception of nature and of \nsocial relations\u2016 was still \u2015possible when there are self-acting mules, railways, \nlocomotives and electric telegraphs?\u201676 A careful reading of Beowulf provides \ninsight into how very different historical conditions gave rise to very particular \ngeographies, as well as the reverse. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nFor comments on an earlier draft of this essay I am grateful to Ben Anderson, \nNeil Brenner, Elgin Diaz, Klaus Dodds, Julia Garratt, Paul Harrison and Barbara \n 24 \nHooper.

I have used \nthe Old English text presented in George Jack (ed.), Beowulf: A Student \nEdition, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994. The translations are \nusually based on the one by Michael Alexander, Penguin: Harmondsworth, \n1973, though I have regularly departed from his renderings. Alterations to \ntranslations do not intend to improve his excellent work, but to make \napparent the uses of specific vocabulary, which is often accomplished \nthrough the inclusion of the Old English words in brackets in the text. In \nthis I have often made use of Jack\u2018s line glosses; and Michael Swanton \n(ed.), Beowulf, Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1997, which is \nbi-lingual, with helpful notes.

Cosgrove, Social \nFormation and Symbolic Landscape, Madison: University of Wisconsin \nPress, new edition, 1998. As Cosgrove himself notes (p. xxv), the \nconception of symbolism is left unclear, while the materiality of social \nformations is much more explicitly theorised. What my attempt here seeks \nto do is to show how the symbolic and the material interrelate in this text. \n6  Nicholas Howe, Writing the Map of Anglo-Saxon England: Essays in \nCultural Geography, New Haven: Yale University Press, 2008. \n7  Howe, Writing the Map, p. 188. \n8  In this its attempt is closer to Fabienne Michelet, Creation, Migration, and \nConquest: Imaginary Geography and Sense of Space in Old English \n 26 \n \nLiterature, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006, Chapter Five, a work I \nmake occasional reference to below. \n9  See, for example, Paul Zumthor, La mesure du monde: repr\u00e9sentation de \nl\u2018espace au Moyen age, Paris: Seuil, 1993; Evelyn Edson, Mapping Time \nand Space: How Medieval Mapmakers Viewed Their World, London: British \nLibrary, 1998; Sylvia Tomasch and Seely Gilles (eds.), Text and Territory: \nGeographical Imagination in the European Middle Ages, Philadelphia: \nUniversity of Pennsylvania Press, 1998; Barbara A.

The Old English phrase is seofan \n\u00de\u016bsendo: \u2015\u00de\u016bsend is sometimes used of value without expression of the \nunit (which is understood from the context). A hide was the normal \nholding of a peasant, sufficient to support a ceorl and his household; its \nextent varied\u2016. See also Swanton (ed.), Beowulf, p. 201, who notes that \nthis was an extensive estate. For a fuller discussion see F. M. Stenton, \nAnglo-Saxon England, Oxford: Clarendon, Second Edition, 1971, pp. 278-\n9; Diana Wood, Medieval Economic Thought, Cambridge University Press, \n2002, Chapter Four, and Dodgshon, The European Past, pp. 158-9. \n60  Swanton (ed.), Beowulf, p. 204, notes that this cannot imply hide, unlike \nline 2195, since the area would be larger than Geatland itself. He suggests \n 32 \n \nthat \u2015the unit of value must be applicable to both land and bullion, and \nwas presumably therefore monetary\u2016. \n61  There is of course an extensive literature on land, and the related term \nlandscape. Little looks at the period of the early Middle Ages in which \nBeowulf is situated.

In her \notherwise remarkable account, Michelet uses the term \u2017territory\u2018 in a way \nthat lacks precision and textual reference.
