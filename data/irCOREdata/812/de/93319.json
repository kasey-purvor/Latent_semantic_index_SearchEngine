and economists, who helped to create this sentiment, in turn exploited\nit to secure appointments and promote their views+\nInstruments to control for the nonrandom selection of economists are then devel-\noped and incorporated in the second-stage model exploring policy decisions+ The\nfindings indicate that formation of a coherent policymaking team of neoliberal\neconomists significantly influenced the decision to liberalize+ The findings sug-\ngest existing explanations are incomplete, as they neglect one of their crucial\ncomplements: the role of neoliberal ideas+ By examining and demonstrating the\nrole of economists in promoting these ideas, this analysis helps one better\nunderstand the process of liberalization in emerging markets+ The results also\nNeoliberal Economists and Capital Account Liberalization 445\ncontribute to one\u2019s understanding of policy diffusion, suggesting that economists\nare an important, though often overlooked, conduit through which ideas and pol-\nicy practices spread+\nEpistemic Communities and Policy Reform\nThe recent literature on policy reforms in emerging markets often features mem-\nbers of an epistemic community of neoliberal economists as key players+9 These\naccounts suggest that professional training of economists serves as a form of social-\nization that shapes their subsequent policy preferences and drives the diffusion of\npolicy practices+ Professional training in economics shapes an individual\u2019s prefer-\nences by promoting, both implicitly and explicitly, a particular set of causal and\nnormative beliefs+10 The technical knowledge and normative beliefs imparted\nthrough professional training subsequently becomes an interpretative lens through\nwhich economists diagnose problems and identify solutions+\nMaterial trends, such as capital mobility, do not come with an \u201cinstruction sheet+\u201d\nRather, they need to be interpreted and policy responses debated and negotiated+\nEconomists thus become critical policymaking actors and help to diffuse policy\npractices when they insert their interpretations into the decision-making process\nthrough persuasion and negotiation+ These interpretations in turn give meaning to\nmaterial trends and legitimate specific policy options+ By defining what policy\nchoices are possible, these interpretations can shape the interests and behavior of\npoliticians+\nSome suggest the appointment process is driven by uncertainty+11 In situations\nof uncertainty, politicians are unable to deduce their preferences and understand-\nings of options from contemporary circumstances and thus turn to the inter-\npretations economists provide+ The process driving the turn to expertise may be\n\u201crationalist\u201d or \u201cconstructivist\u201d in that politicians may delegate authority to econ-\nomists due to their informational advantage or because economists\u2019 credentials\nconstitute them as authoritative sources of information+12\nOthers propose alternative models of the appointment process, focusing on the\nincentives driving the turn to expertise+ One such model\u2014which I label the cred-\nibility model\u2014claims that politicians appoint neoliberal economists as a signal to\nofficial and private creditors of a government\u2019s creditworthiness as well as the\ncredibility of its commitment to a particular policy orientation+13 Due to their sim-\nilar professional training, neoliberal economists and external financial representa-\ntives often share common policy orientations and speak the same language ~both\n9+ See Babb 2001;
