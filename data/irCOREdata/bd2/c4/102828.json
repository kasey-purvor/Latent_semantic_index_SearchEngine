INTRODUCTION\nThere has been considerable interest in highly sp3\nbonded, tetrahedral forms of amorphous carbon ~ta-C! in re-\ncent years due to their remarkable physical properties.1\nKoskinen,2 and Ishikawa, Ogawa, and Takagi,3 and Lifshitz\net al.4,5 have produced ta-C films containing high fractions of\nsp3 bonding using the mass selected ion-beam ~MSIB! depo-\nsition method. McKenzie, Muller, and Pailthorpe6 and Fallon\net al.7 have also produced highly sp3 bonded ta-C films us-\ning a plasma beam of C1 ions from a filtered cathodic\nvacuum arc ~FCVA!. It was found that the properties of ta-C\nsuch as density pass through a maximum as a function of C1\nion energy in each process.\nThe formation of ta-C by MSIB and FCVA has generally\nbeen attributed to deposition by an energetic species, C1. It\nis also possible to produce high-density a-C films by other\ndeposition methods using energetic species,8 such as ion-\nassisted deposition in which energetic Ar ions bombard ther-\nmal C atoms during the deposition process. Savvides9 was\nable to produce diamondlike carbon by this method using an\nunbalanced magnetron, although his method of optical analy-\nsis is believed to overestimate the sp3 content. Cuomo\net al.10 were able to prepare a-C films with densities up to 3\ng\/cm3 by dual-ion-beam sputtering onto well-cooled sub-\nstrates. Andre, Rossi, and Dunlop11 prepared diamondlike\ncarbon films with densities up to 2.7 g\/cm3 using a dual-ion-\nbeam system ~DIBS! and ion-beam-assisted dc magnetron\n~IBAM!. Kleber et al.12 deposited a-C by magnetron sputter-\ning but the films had a density of 2.0 g\/cm3, which is typical\nof many magnetron sputtered films.\nThis article demonstrates that it is possible to deposit\nta-C without the use of C1 ion beams or plasma beams by\nusing magnetron sputtering in the presence of ion plating\n~MS\/IP!. A dc-biased, unbalanced rf magnetron sputter1416 J. Appl. Phys. 79 (3), 1 February 1996 0021-8979\nded\u00ac24\u00acSep\u00ac2010\u00acto\u00ac131.227.178.158.\u00acRedistribution\u00acsubject\u00acto\u00acAsource is operated under conditions of intense Ar-ion plating.\nThe advantage of the magnetron sputter source is that this\ntechnique is widely established in industry and allows the\ndeposition onto large areas with relatively high deposition\nrates. The use of a suitable unbalanced magnetic-field con-\nfiguration places the substrate immersed in the plasma so that\nthe growing film is bombarded by energetic Ar ions from the\nplasma. This MS\/IP technique is quite effective and has been\nused by Ulrich et al.13 to deposit pure c-BN films.\nThe a-C films produced by MS\/IP are characterized in\nterms of their density, sp3 fraction, and intrinsic stress. The\narticle also discusses possible mechanisms for the deposition\nof ta-C by ion plating. The data show that the deposition\nmechanism differs from that when the film grows from en-\nergetic C1 ions. The growth of ta-C from energetic C1 ions\nis generally believed to be described by the subplantation\nmechanism in which the C ions are energetic enough to enter\nsubsurface atomic sites. In MS\/IP, the energetic species is the\nAr1 ion, which acts only to bombard the growing a-C film\nand is not incorporated in the film. Three types of deposition\nprocesses may be of importance:\n~i! displacement of C atoms by Ar1 ions into subsurface\npositions ~knock-on or indirect subplantation!;\n~ii! surface densification of the sputtered carbon atoms in\nthe thin film by argon-ion bombardment;\n~iii! conversion of sp2 to sp3 sites by a high local stress,\nwhich is generated by the intense argon ion plating.\nThese three mechanisms are expected to have different\nprocess parameters. The subplantation definitely has a\nthreshold energy, namely the displacement energy, which for\ncarbon lies between 25 and 35 eV. The densification process\nshould be of importance at low collision energies ~few eV!\nand high ion flux rates Fi ~compared to the flux rate of\/96\/79(3)\/1416\/7\/$6.00 \u00a9 1996 American Institute of Physics\nIP\u00aclicense\u00acor\u00accopyright;\u00acsee\u00achttp:\/\/jap.aip.org\/about\/rights_and_permissions\nDownloadneutral carbon atoms Fn!. The stress-induced phase transi-\ntion in the pT phase diagram must show a stress threshold.\nII. EXPERIMENT\nThe magnetron is described in detail elsewhere.14,15 In\nan unbalanced magnetron, the plasma extends over both the\ntarget and the substrate, so that the Ar ions provide both the\nsputtering flux to the graphite target and the ion plating flux\non the growing film. A high flux of neutral C atoms is\nachieved by placing the magnets as close as possible to the\ngraphite target. The configuration of the magnets is a critical\nparameter, as this determines both the neutral carbon flux Fn\nand the Ar-ion flux Fi , thereby controlling the deposition\nrate and the ion plating intensity.\nThe substrates are sputter cleaned before deposition for\n15 min and they are placed at a distance of 60 mm from the\ntarget. All films have been deposited with rf power of 200 W\nand rf frequency of 13.56 MHz. The argon pressure is kept\nconstant at 1.431023 mbar. The substrate temperature re-\nmains below 70 \u00b0C. The ion energy and ion fluxes are deter-\nmined by a Faraday cup placed at the substrate position us-\ning a retarding field.\nThe density and sp3 content were measured by electron-\nenergy-loss spectroscopy ~EELS!. The plasmon spectra of\nthe films were recorded on a 25 keV electron loss spectrom-\neter with a typical energy resolution of 0.38 eV and an ac-\nceptance angle of 2 mrad. The spectra were corrected for the\neffects of multiple inelastic scattering and of the restricted\nacceptance angle. The density was deduced from the valence\nplasmon energy. Further EELS measurements were per-\nformed using a Philips CM30 transmission electron micro-\nscope ~TEM! operated at 100 keV. The sp3 content was de-\nrived from the intensity of the p* peak in the C K loss\nspectrum, measured on a dedicated parallel EELS spectrom-\neter on a TEM.\nThe stress was derived from the curvature of the Si sub-\nstrates using Stoney\u2019s equation. The thickness of the films is\nabout 100 nm measured by ellipsometer and profilometer.\nThe argon content was measured by Rutherford backscatter-\ning with He1 ion energy of 2 MeV.\nFilms for optical gap measurements were prepared on\nquartz glass substrates, and the bias voltage was applied in\nthe form of a rf self-bias. The Tauc gap was determined from\ntransmission and reflection spectra.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA. Film properties\nThe analysis of the ion energy distribution and ion mass\nspectra show that the flux at the substrate consists mainly of\nneutral C atoms and Ar1 ions.14 The mass analysis shows\nthat the C ion flux is only about 1% of the C atom flux and\ntherefore it does not play a significant role in the deposition\nprocess.\nThe energy En of the neutral C atoms results from the\nenergy distribution of the sputter process and amounts to a\nfew eV.15 The energy of the Ar ions for zero bias voltage is\ngiven by the plasma potential of 24.2 eV and it has a rather\nsharp energy distribution of 7 eV. With additional bias theJ. Appl. Phys., Vol. 79, No. 3, 1 February 1996\ned\u00ac24\u00acSep\u00ac2010\u00acto\u00ac131.227.178.158.\u00acRedistribution\u00acsubject\u00acto\u00acAwidth of the energy distribution remains constant. The ratio\nF of the argon ion flux Fi to carbon neutral flux Fn is found\nto be 5.4. This means that on average each carbon atom is hit\nby about five argon ions while it rests on the film surface.\nThe product EnFn is much smaller than EiF i of the argon\nions and can be neglected in the energy balance during film\nformation.\nThe C atom flux was derived from the mass deposition\nrate. The deposition rate is 0.43 \u00c5\/s at an argon-ion energy of\n24.2 eV and decreases to 0.27 \u00c5\/s for an Ar-ion energy of\n130 eV. Since Fn and En remains constant, the reduction in\nfilm thickness with increasing ion plating energy results\npartly from the densification of the material and partly from\nresputtering of the deposited carbon film.\nFigure 1 shows the variation of the intrinsic stress of the\na-C films as a function of Ar1-ion energy for an ion flux\nratio of F55.4. For each Ar plating energy the stress has\nbeen measured for five times always showing the same be-\nhavior. Here the medium stress of those measurements is\nplotted in Fig. 1. The stress is compressive, and it is intrinsic\nbecause the films are deposited at room temperature, so there\nis no component due to the thermal expansion coefficients.\nThe stress is seen to increase gradually and to pass through a\nmaximum of 16 GPa at an Ar1 energy of 100 eV before\ndecreasing again at higher Ar1 energies. The compressive\nstress variation is found to be more sharply peaked at a flux\nF of 10, reaching a value of 19 GPa at a slightly lower\nAr-ion energy of 90 eV.\nFigures 2 and 3 show the variation of the density and sp3\ncontent with Ar1 energy for F55.4 and 10. As the Ar1 en-\nergy increases, the density is seen to remain at a graphitic\nvalue of about 2.0 g\/cm3 up to 70 eV and then to increase\nsharply to a peak of 2.7 g\/cm3 at around 105 eV for F55.4\nand to a peak of 3.1 g\/cm3 at 90 eV for F510. The density\nthen decreases sharply at highly Ar1 energies to its graphitic\nvalue. The sp3 fraction behaves roughly in a similar fashion,\nstaying at quite low sp3 values and then increasing sharply\nfor Ar1 energies around 80\u2013120 eV, before decreasing\nFIG. 1. Stress as a function of argon-ion plating energy for carbon films\ndeposited at a F i\/Fn ratio of 5.4.1417Schwan et al.\nIP\u00aclicense\u00acor\u00accopyright;\u00acsee\u00achttp:\/\/jap.aip.org\/about\/rights_and_permissions\nDownloasharply again. The peak value of sp3 fraction is 60% for\nF55.4 and 87% for F510.\nIn order to gain more information about the deposition\nmechanism, it is instructive to plot the density and sp3 frac-\ntion against compressive stress, as shown in Figs. 4 and 5.\nThe density variation is seen to lie on the same curve plotted\nversus stress for both ion flux ratios. The density is seen to\nremain low until the stress reaches about 13 GPa, and then\nincreases strongly with stress. The sp3 fraction also varies in\na similar fashion with stress, remaining relatively constant\nand then increasing rapidly once the stress exceeds the\nthreshold of 13 GPa. There is a greater scatter for the sp3\ndata; the sp3 values at low stress appear slightly higher for\nF510, but the data tend to lie in the same curve above the\nthreshold.\nThis variation of density and sp3 content with stress is\ndifferent from that found in ta-C deposited from the FCVA,\nFIG. 2.

A similar variation was found for ta-C from the\nFCVA .6,16 A similar dependence is found because the depen-\ndence of density on sp3 content is essentially a property of\nthe material.16 In contrast, the dependence of density and sp3\ncontent on stress is a function of the deposition process itself.\nFigure 7 shows the Ar content of the a-C films as a\nfunction of Ar1 energy as determined by Rutherford back-\nscattering spectroscopy ~RBS!. The Ar content is seen to be\nquite low, 6%, and to decrease to a value of only 3% at an\nAr1 energy of 100 eV, where the film density reaches a\nmaximum. This suggests that Ar incorporation is restricted\nwhen the ta-C density is high. Further this suggests that the\nmain component of the stress must come from the carbon\nstructure itself.\nFIG. 5. sp3 content vs stress for carbon films deposited at ~j!

Deposition mechanism\nThe creation of sp3 sites in ta-C prepared by energetic\nC1 ion deposition is generally believed to arise from\nsubplantation.4,17\nThe ion has sufficient energy to penetrate the surface\natomic layer and enter a subsurface atomic site. There are\ntwo ways a C atom could occupy a subsurface site, either by\ndirect penetration @Fig. 8~a!# or by incident ion displacing a\nsurface atom into that site @Fig. 8~b!#. The subplantation also\ncreates a large compressive stress. This process has been\nanalyzed recently,17,18 and analytic expressions have been\ngiven for the fraction of sp3 sites.\nMS\/IP deposition differs in that energetic Ar1 ions can\nonly displace C atoms from the surface into subsurface sites.\nThis is analogous to the displacement process in Fig. 8~b!.\nSubplantation by both process ~a! and ~b! requires the ion\nenergy to exceed a threshold, close to the displacement en-\nergy of about 25 eV.17 The density should then increase\ngradually above this energy, until it begins to decrease at\nhigh ion energies, due to the annealing in a thermal spike.\nFIG. 6. Density vs sp3 content for carbon films deposited at ~j! F55.4 and\n~h! F510.\nFIG. 7. Argon content as a function of argon-ion plating energy.J. Appl. Phys., Vol. 79, No. 3, 1 February 1996\ned\u00ac24\u00acSep\u00ac2010\u00acto\u00ac131.227.178.158.\u00acRedistribution\u00acsubject\u00acto\u00acAThe density and sp3 content clearly do not follow this be-\nhavior in the MS\/IP ta-C. This suggests that the knock-on\nsubplantation, process ~b!, is not particularly efficient, in that\nthere is little increase in density up to say 60 eV. In contrast\nthe compressive stress is found to follow the expected de-\npendence on ion energy. However, this is still not consistent\nwith the original subplantation model in that the stress and\ndensity should correlate with each other.\nA second possible process is that the Ar-ion bombard-\nment could cause a densification of surface layers by displac-\ning C atoms inward. In this model the densification and\nstress formation of the sputtered carbon atoms in the films\nare due to energy and momentum transfer by low-energy\nargon-ion plating. The knock-on collisions of the argon ions\nensures that void formation is unlikely. This process is ex-\npected to be significant because each C atom is hit by on\naverage five Ar1 ions before being covered by the next layer.\nDensification differs from subplantation in that it does not\nrequire a threshold energy. The lack of densification at low\nenergies however suggests that this process is relatively\nsmall in MS\/IP.\nThe third possible process is a stress-induced transfor-\nmation of sp2 sites to sp3 sites. McKenzie and co-workers6\nattributed the generation of ta-C to a quasithermodynamic\ntransition on a pressure\/temperature phase diagram. In his\nmodel, pressure is generated by the stress in the films\nwhereas temperature is generated by energetic carbon ions\nimpinging on the surface of the carbon film. Takano, Ha-\nrashima, and Wakatsuki,19 Endo et al.,20 and Yagi et al.21\nhave shock compressed graphite at room temperature. They\nreported a martensitic ~displacive! phase transformation from\nsp2 to sp3 bonded carbon at room temperature for pressure\nvalues above 15 GPa. Scandolo et al.22 and Kitabatake23\nshowed by ab initio molecular-dynamic studies a pressure-\ninduced transformation path of graphite to diamond. In the\ncase of MS\/IP ta-C we observe that the deposition process\nhas created a very large compressive stress. This stress is\nlarger than that found in ta-C formed by FCVA. Simulations\nsuggest that the stress is not uniform but varies between\nsites.24 Since the sp3 content enhances rapidly if the stress\nexceeds values above 14 GPa ~see also Fig. 7!, we propose\nFIG. 8. Direct and knock-on ~indirect! penetration by ions.1419Schwan et al.\nIP\u00aclicense\u00acor\u00accopyright;\u00acsee\u00achttp:\/\/jap.aip.org\/about\/rights_and_permissions\nDownlothat this stress causes pairs of sp2 sites to bond together to\nform sp3 sites. The stress in the films induces a phase trans-\nformation of sp2 to sp3 hybridized carbon. The observed\nthreshold stress is large, about 14 GPa from Figs. 4 and 5.\nThis stress is much larger than that given by the Berman\u2013\nSimon line 1.6 GPa, which corresponds to the isothermal\nconversion of graphite to diamond. It seems that stress val-\nues above say 4 GPa and below 14 GPa are a necessary\ncondition for the preparation of ta-C films, but they are not a\nsufficient condition for the preparation of ta-C films.\nThe different processes can clearly be distinguished by\ntheir different threshold energies. In the subplantation model\nthe energy threshold is given by the displacement energy.\nDensification should occur if ions have a higher energy than\nthe displacement energy. In contrast, there is no threshold in\nthe densification model. The densification by these deposi-\ntion processes plays a minor role because stress and densifi-\ncation do not correlate with each other and no densification\nis observed for Ar-ion energies below 60 eV.\nIn the third process, a threshold stress of about 14 GPa\nexists for the transformation of sp2 sites to sp3 sites. This is\nclose to the threshold observed for shock-compressed\ngraphite.19\u201321\nC. Electrical properties\nThe Tauc gap of each of the films was found to be low,\nwell below 1 eV, even in those films containing large sp3\ncontents. The optical gap is controlled by the configuration\nof the p states.25 The intense ion bombardment during depo-\nsition is likely to produce strong disordering of the sp2 sites,\nand to lower the optical gap.26 The lowering of the optical\nband gap arises from the mixing of s and p states.\nThe density of electronically active defect states can be\nmeasured by electron-spin resonance ~ESR!. Figure 9 shows\nthat the spin density is sizeable in MS\/IP a-C. The spin den-\nsity is seen to be a minimum at the Ar1 energy of maximum\ndensity. The spin density is found to be less than in ta-C\nprepared by the FCVA,27 despite the higher disorder in the\npresent films. This suggests that defect density is not just\ncontrolled by the intrinsic disorder.\nFIG. 9. Spin density as a function of argon-ion plating energy.1420 J. Appl. Phys., Vol. 79, No. 3, 1 February 1996\naded\u00ac24\u00acSep\u00ac2010\u00acto\u00ac131.227.178.158.\u00acRedistribution\u00acsubject\u00acto\u00acAIThe width of the ESR line gives information on the na-\nture of the defect state. With ESR a narrow ESR line of about\n2.5 G is found for films deposited at all argon plating ener-\ngies. In a-C the spin signal is thought to arise from unsatur-\nated p bonds. A narrow ESR line in a-C is a strong indica-\ntion that exchange narrowing occurs. A small linewidth of\n2.5 G indicates that the p-spin centers are close together and\ninteract, so that those sp2 clusters where the spins are located\nare not independent from each other and pairing of spins is\nlikely to occur.\nThe MS\/IP a-C films show a high electrical conductivity\n~.4 V21 cm21!. This finding can be understood if we as-\nsume connected sp2 regions. This would also be consistent\nwith the narrow optical gap in these materials. Rossnagel,\nRussak, and Cuomo28 found that magnetron-sputtered a-C at\na pressure of 1023 mbar had a conductivity of 1 V21 cm21,\nsimilar to the value found here. The electronic properties are\ndetermined by the sp2 matrix due to the p-p* states being\ncloser to the Fermi level.25\nD. Raman\nThe Raman spectrum of the ta-C film for F55.4 is\nshown in Fig. 10. Generally speaking, the Raman spectra of\nnanocrystalline C are dominated by the features of the sp2\ncomponent because of its much larger Raman scattering. The\nRaman spectra are fitted by four Gaussians. The 1600 cm21\nG peak corresponds to the zone center Raman mode of\ngraphite. The 1380 cm21 D peak corresponds to the zone\nboundary mode of graphite which becomes active for finite\ncrystallites.29 The origin of the peak at 1480 cm21 is not\nclear.\nThe peak at 1170 cm21 is not due to a sp2 feature. Ne-\nmanich et al.30 said that this feature is present in films with\nsmall amounts of diamond crystalline domains indicating\nthat it could be a diamond precursor structure.

These conditions are normally\nsuitable for diamond deposition. The atomic hydrogen in the\nplasma causes preferential etching of amorphous and gra-\nphitic carbon structures. These conditions will even etch ta-C\nwhich has been deposited by FCVA or by a plasma beam\nsource.33 However, the plasma does not fully etch ta-C de-\nposited by MS\/IP. This indicates that the MS\/IP deposited\nfilms contains sp3 nuclei which were not completely etched\nby atomic hydrogen. The treatment of such films under dia-\nmond growing conditions leads to a cauliflower appearance\nof growth ~Fig. 11!. Conclusive x-ray diffraction ~XRD!\nmeasurements for the existence of diamond seeds in the films\ncould not be performed, because the needed film thickness\n~for XRD! of the carbon films is limited due to the high\nstress. Synchrotron XRD measurements which can deal with\n100-nm-thick films are in preparation.\nTherefore we assume that the structure of the MS\/IP de-\nposited carbon films is given by a sp2 matrix or net, in which\nsp3 clusters are embedded. It seems that there is some, not\nyet identified, order in the sp3 clusters as indicated from\nRaman spectra and from the diamond nucleation experiment.\nSuch a cluster structure would explain the electronic proper-\nties ~sp2 matrix\/net! and the high density. Also stress and sp3\ncontent are explained by the existence of such clusters.\nThe physical properties of the ta-C films prepared under\nthe MS\/IP conditions are completely different to those of the\nta-C prepared by the MSIB technique or vacuum arc. Table I\nshows some physical properties for ta-C prepared by the in-\ndirect subplantation process ~MS\/IP! and direct subplantation\nprocess ~FCVA!. The different physical properties of the ta-C\nfilms have their origin in the different microstructures of the\nmaterials.\nFIG. 11.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\nRecently, Ulrich et al.13,37 have prepared c-BN films by\nrf magnetron sputtering and ion plating with an c-BN content\nof about 93%. In both cases, the BN and the presently de-\nscribed C films have high fractions of sp3 bondings. These\nmetastable materials have higher densities than their stable\nsp2 modifications, i.e., hexagonal BN and graphite. In both\ncases it has been shown that low-energy but intense ion bom-\nbardment with argon ions the densities of the films can be\nincreased considerably leading to phase transition in both\ncases to the sp3-rich modifications at low temperatures.\nCompressive stress in the films arises from ion peening.\nThe compressive stress may be explained in terms of the\nsubplantation model. However, the subplantation model does\nnot explain the energy-dependent sharp maximum in density\nof the carbon films. Further the lack of densification at low\nion energies suggests that ~indirect! subplantation process\nand densification process by argon bombardment have only a\nsmall influence on the densification of the C films.\nStress measurements reveal that sp3 bonded carbon is\npredominantly deposited for stress values above 14 GPa. The\nexistence of such a stress threshold proves that in the MS\/IP\na-C films exists a stress-induced transformation from\nsp2!sp3 bonded sites. The stress threshold for the deposi-\ntion of dense carbon films is much higher than the Berman\u2013\nSimon line which was proposed by McKenzie and co-\nworkers.6\nThe present results indicate strong clustering of sp3 hy-\nbridized carbon. Those sp3 seeds are responsible for the high\ndensity in the carbon films. The electronic properties, such as\noptical gap and electrical conductivity of the deposited\nMS\/IP carbon films, seem to be predominantly determined\nby a sp2 matrix in which sp3 clusters are embedded.\nIt follows from our experimental results that, quite gen-\nerally, by low-energy ion plating at low temperatures any\nmetastable material can be produced, if its density is higher\nthan the density of its stable modification. This is of impor-\ntance for the production of superhard coatings with C, B, and\nN,38 consisting of covalent bondings.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors want to thank Professor Schmoranzer, Phys-\nics Department, University of Kaiserslautern, for most valu-\nable support by EELS measurements.\nTABLE I.
