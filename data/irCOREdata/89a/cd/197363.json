Secondary\noutcomes were mean EPDS score, Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation \u2013 Outcome Measure (CORE-OM) score,\nState\u2013Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) and Parenting Stress Index Short\nForm (PSI-SF) scores at 6, 12 and 18 months.\nResults. After adjusting for individual-level covariates, living alone, previous postnatal depression (PND), the\npresence of one or more adverse life events and the 6-week EPDS score, the odds ratio (OR) for EPDS o12 at 6\nmonths was 0.71 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53\u20130.97, p=0.031] for the intervention group (IG) women compared\nwith the control (CAU) group women. Two subgroups were formed by baseline severity : a \u2018 subthreshold \u2019 subgroup\nwith a 6-week EPDS score of 6\u201311 (n=999) and a \u2018 lowest severity \u2019 subgroup with a 6-week EPDS score of 0\u20135\n(n=1242). There was no difference in psychological effectiveness by subgroup (interaction term: z=x0.28, p=0.782).\nConclusions.

But how might\nthis be achieved? A highly significant predictor\nof depression within adulthood is \u2018subthreshold \u2019 de-\npression (Judd et al. 2002 ; Cuijpers & Smit, 2004).\nDepression prevention through the extension of cog-\nnitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to at-risk adolescents\nwho had symptoms that fell short of the threshold for\ncase depression (Clarke et al. 2001; Garber et al. 2009)\nmay be effective because subthreshold levels are\nhighly predictive of depression (Cuijpers et al. 2005).\nIt is not known whether such skilful psychological\napproaches could also benefit a much wider range of\npeople at risk of developing depression if delivered\nuniversally across an entire population to adults at all\nrisk levels.\nIn the UK all infants and all mothers, following\nchildbirth, receive individual care from a specialist\ncommunity nurse, known as a \u2018Health Visitor \u2019 (HV).\nIn addition to supporting infant care, the HV has a role\nin maternal mental health that should involve estab-\nlishing a relationship with the mother and the use of\ninterpersonal and communication skills (Morrell et al.\n2009b). However, such practitioners are given little\nmore than basic mental health knowledge. Could\ntraining HVs in psychological skills benefit women\nunder their care who were not at immediate risk?\nIn this paper we report on the benefits for all non-\ndepressed postnatal women randomized to receive\nsupport from primary care nurses with specialized\ntraining in psychologically informed approaches to\nhealth care, in a large pragmatic cluster randomized\ncontrolled and economic evaluation trial.\nWe have already reported on postnatal women in\nrandomly allocated intervention group (IG) clusters\ncared for by an HV who had received additional\ntraining in postnatal mental health assessment and in\none of two psychologically informed approaches that\nwere compared to usual HV care (Morrell et al. 2009a).\nClinical assessment and psychologically informed\napproaches were designed to be offered by inter-\nvention group HVs to women scoring positive on\nthe Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)\n(Morrell et al. 2009b) at 8 weeks following childbirth.\nThe EPDS is a widely used self-report measure to\nidentify women at risk of postnatal depression (PND)\nwith good evidence of sensitivity and specificity\n(Gibson et al. 2009 ; Hewitt et al. 2009) and a score\nranging from 0 to 30, consisting of eight depression\nand two anxiety items. We compared IG care with\npostnatal care as usual (CAU). We showed that these\nscoring positive IG women were less likely than CAU\nwomen to have later depression, indicated by scoring\no12 on a postal EPDS at 6 months postnatally [odds\nratio (OR) 0.62, 95% CI 0.04\u20130.97, unadjusted p=0.036]\n(Morrell et al. 2009a).\nThe trial was also designed to assess effectiveness\naccording to severity of depression at baseline (www.\ncontrolled-trials.com\/ISRCTN92195776). Because out-\ncome data were obtained on all randomized and\nconsenting women, we were able to estimate any ef-\nfects on women with baseline symptom scores below\nthe 6 weeks postnatal EPDS threshold of o12 (Cox\net al. 1987). Thus, the present paper reports new, un-\npublished analyses of outcomes from the original\ntreatment trial, principally for women who scored\n<12 on the postal EPDS at 6 weeks postnatally, using\nthe same trial primary outcome: EPDS o12 at\n6 months. First, effects on outcomes at 6, 12 and 18\nmonths postnatally were examined for women with\nan EPDS<12 at 6 weeks. Second, to test whether\nadditional training of HVs was of benefit to women\nacross a lower range of EPDS-negative scores, we\ncompared the effectiveness in women at the lowest\nEPDS severity levels (EPDS<6 at 6 weeks) with sub-\nthreshold scoring women (6-week EPDS scores from\n6 to 11). Third, we examined differences in HV care,\nincluding the use of randomly allocated face-to-face\nadministered depression assessment, because such\nadditional practitioner involvement could explain any\nobserved effect on later risk of depression.\nMethod\nThe main pragmatic cluster randomized trial design\nand methods, on which the present analysis is based,\nare reported in detail elsewhere (Morrell et al. 2009a).\nThe present study involved assessing outcomes for\nwomen in 101 primary care practices (clusters) (in one\nregion of England, serving a population of 5.1 million),\ntermed \u2018EPDS-negative \u2019, who had a postal EPDS score\n<12 at 6 weeks postnatally. Following recruitment of\nparticipating practices, an independent statistician\ngenerated the random allocation sequence using a\ncomputer randomization program (Morrell et al.\n2009a). Thus, HVs registered to consenting practices\nwere randomized either to continue to provide post-\nnatal CAU or to an experimental IG in which all HVs\nreceived additional training in systematic assessment\nof depressive symptoms, establishing warm, thera-\npeutic relationships, and in one of two distinct ex-\nperimental psychologically informed approaches.\nEligible antenatal women were then recruited if they\nwere registered with participating (and therefore\nrandomized) GP practices, agedo18 years and had no\nsevere or enduring mental health problems. HVs were\nasked to send these women a research information\nleaflet and a consent form at 36 weeks of pregnancy or\n4 weeks antenatally. Women returned their signed\n740 T. S. Brugha et al.\nforms to the HVs. Altogether, 4084 (53.4%) of 7649\neligible antenatal women provided written informed\nconsent during 2003\u20132004. Consenting women were\nsent a questionnaire at 6 weeks and 6, 12 and 18\nmonths postnatally from the research office. Women\nwho scored o12 on their 6-week postal EPDS were\nregarded as EPDS positive (n=595 women in 86\nclusters) and were excluded from all of the present\noutcomes analyses. Half of all women in the inter-\nvention clusters (including EPDS-negative women)\nwere randomly allocated to complete a face-to-face\nEPDS 6 weeks postnatally to coincide with usual HV\ncare during an existing HV contact. The intervention\ncluster HVs, if their clinical assessment indicated that\nany mother might benefit, could also offer the psycho-\nlogically informed sessions to which their practice had\nbeen randomized.\nIdentical to the treatment trial protocol (Morrell\net al. 2009b), the pretrial determined primary outcome\nwas the proportion of women scoring o12 on the\nEPDS at 6 months postnatally. We assumed an intra-\ncluster coefficient (ICC) of 0.006 (Morrell et al. 2009b)\nand an average cluster of practice size of 25 EPDS-\nnegative women. Thus, 2489 women (1659 IG and 830\nCAU) were required to have 80% power at the 5%\ntwo-sided level of significance, to detect a 3.5%\nabsolute difference (10% v. 6.5%) in the proportions of\n6-week EPDS-negative IG and CAU women scoring\no12 on the EPDS at 6 months postnatally. Clusters\nwere allocated for the trial to one of two HV psycho-\nlogically based approaches (experimental IG) or HV\nCAU, in a ratio of 1 :1 :1. The clusters were stratified by\nthe number of expected births per cluster per year,\ninto three groups (<70, 70\u2013100,>100).\nThe cluster level intervention comprised the pack-\nage of HV training in assessment of postnatal women\nand identification of depressive symptoms using the\nEPDS and additional clinical assessment skills and\nestablishing warm, therapeutic relationships. They\nwere trained to deliver one of two distinct psycho-\nlogically informed approaches [a cognitive-behavioral\napproach (CBA) and a person-centered approach\n(PCA)], delivered at the individual level, with the\nprovision of additional supervisory support for the\nHVs (Morrell et al. 2009b). The HV-provided psycho-\nlogically informed session was a one-hour visit, once a\nweek, for a maximum of 8 weeks, commencing around\n8 weeks postnatally. Sessions were offered to women\nwho scored o12 on the postal EPDS at 6 weeks and\nalso on a face-to-face EPDS administered at 8 weeks\npostnatally.\nIG HVs received a day of training in the identi-\nfication of depression using the EPDS and clinical\nassessment. The group training in the pretrial pre-\nparatory phase lasted 8 days in total (including four\nhalf-days), focusing on the development of cognitive\nbehavioral or person-centered intervention skills de-\nlivered in a group training format. A common element\nof the training, preceding specific approach-based\nskills, concerned development of empathic relation-\nships. The training package was followed by two\nhalf-day reflective practice sessions and access to\nregular supervision sessions. Two experienced\npsychotherapist practitioner trainers delivered the\ntraining, which followed a prepared manualized form\nand was agreed by a training reference group com-\nposed of experienced psychotherapy trainers. HVs\nwere asked to tape record their intervention sessions\n(with the women\u2019s consent) so that session treatment\nfidelity could be checked. From the recorded sessions\navailable it was clear that high levels of adherence\nwere achieved. HVs and women were also asked to\ncomplete the Agnew Relationship Measure to measure\nthe therapeutic relationship between them. Further\ndetails of the training are available in Morrell et al.\n(2009b) and in findings to be reported separately.\nHVs were blind to all research outcomes. Secondary\noutcomes were measured in all women who were\nfollowed up at 6, 12 and 18 months postnatally by\npostal questionnaires (including the EPDS at 6 and\n12 months only). These included the 12-item Short\nForm Health Survey (SF-12) and the SF-6D (Ware et al.\n1995), the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation \u2013\nOutcome Measure (CORE-OM) scales (Barkham et al.\n2001) and the State\u2013Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI ;\nSpielberger et al. 1970). We used the CORE-OM as a\nmeasure of global distress as used by psychological\ntherapy services to distinguish between clinical\nand general populations. We measured postnatal\nanxiety symptoms using the STAI (Spielberger et al.\n1970). To achieve the required sample size for the\n6-month primary outcome, the recruitment phase\nwas extended. However, the follow-up phase was\nnot similarly extended; therefore, all the women for\nwhom a 6-month outcome was available did not have\na baby who was 1 year or 18 months old within the\nfollow-up phase. Therefore, fewer questionnaires\nwere administered at these time points. We requested\nfunds to extend the recruitment phase but none were\nprovided.\nEthical approval was received from Trent Region\nMulti-centre Research Ethics Committee.\nStatistical analysis\nThe primary comparison reported for this analysis\nwas between eligible women in randomized IG prac-\ntices versus those in CAU randomized practices, with\nan EPDS score<12 at 6 weeks postnatally in addition\nto a valid 6-month EPDS outcome score (n=2241\nUniversal prevention of depression 741\nEPDS-negative women in 101 clusters). All analyses\nwere by intention to treat with a p value <0.05\nregarded as statistically significant. A marginal gen-\neralized linear model (GLM), with coefficients esti-\nmated using generalized estimating equations (GEEs),\nwith robust standard errors and an exchangeable\nautocorrelation matrix in Stata version 11 (StataCorp,\n2009) was used to analyze outcomes and allow for the\nclustered nature of the data, with associated 95% CIs.\nWe fitted simple unadjusted models, and also adjusted\noutcome comparisons for individual level covariates :\nliving alone, history of PND, presence of stressful life\nevents (Brugha et al. 1985) and 6-week EPDS score,\nas the most widely identified significant predictors\nof PND (O\u2019Hara & Swain, 1996). To test whether any\nintervention effect was confined to those scoring im-\nmediately below the EPDS scoring cut-off only, we\nperformed an intervention by baseline (6-week) EPDS\nscore statistical interaction test. This compared women\ngrouped to baseline EPDS scores of 6\u201311 with women\nwith a baseline EPDS score <6. We compared\n6-month outcomes according to whether women were\nin practices randomized for HVs to provide a face-\nto-face assessment at 6 weeks plus postal assessment\ncompared to postal EPDS only. Evidence for dimin-\nished and differential health benefit over time, be-\ntween the groups, was tested for in a longitudinal\nmodel by looking for evidence of an IG by time inter-\naction. Thus, longitudinal modeling of 6, 12 and\n18 months secondary outcomes, also using a marginal\nGLM with coefficients estimated by GEEs, was per-\nformed to examine time effects, group differences and\npossible time by group interactions on the secondary\noutcomes. The longitudinal models adjust for cluster-\ning of individual responses over time and not by\npractice. For the primary outcomes, the binary EPDS\nscores at 6 and 12 months, we used the multiple im-\nputation procedure in STATA version 11 (StataCorp,\n2009) to impute missing EPDS outcomes based on 100\nimputations using a logistic regression model with\n6-week EPDS score, lives alone, history of PND and\nlife events as predictors. The trial is reported ac-\ncording to the CONSORT guidelines for cluster trials\n(Campbell et al. 2004).\nResults\nFigure 1 shows the trial profile. The 6-week question-\nnaire return rate was 83.7% (3419\/4084), of whom\n17.4% of women (595\/3419) had an EPDS score of\no12 and 82.6% (2824\/3419) were EPDS-negative. At\n6 months, 79.4% (2241\/2824) of the EPDS-negative\nwomen had returned both 6-week and 6-month ques-\ntionnaires, 767 in the control (CAU) group and 1474\nin the IG. Table 1 shows the baseline and 6-week\ncharacteristics of these 2241 new mothers. The\nobserved ICC for the primary outcome, the proportion\nof women with an EPDS score of o12 at 6 months,\nin the 100 clusters was 0.001 (95% CI 0.000\u20130.015).\nAs reported previously (Morrell et al. 2009a),\nTable 2 shows that, at 6 months following childbirth,\n83 out of 767 (10.8%) control (CAU) women and 113\nof 1474 IG women (7.7%) scored o12 on the EPDS\nat 6 months, that is an absolute difference of 3.1%\n(95% CI 0.4\u20135.5) or a relative difference of 0.68 (95% CI\n0.50\u20130.93, p=0.016). Of the covariates (living alone,\nprevious PND, presence of adverse life events in the\npast 6 months and 6-week EPDS score), only living\nalone was not a significant predictor of the EPDS at\n6 months. After adjusting for individual-level covari-\nates, the OR for a score of o12 at 6 months was 0.71\n(95% CI, 0.53\u20130.97, p=0.031) for IG women compared\nwith CAU women. Multiple imputation computing\nfor missing 6-month EPDS scores increased the sample\nsize from 2241 to 2786, and the OR using the imputed\ndata, with adjustment for covariates, was similar to the\nobserved data (0.76, 95% CI 0.56\u20131.03, p=0.073).\nThe EPDS-negative women were divided into\ntwo subgroups: a \u2018subthreshold\u2019 subgroup scoring\nbetween 6 and 11 on the 6-week EPDS (n=999) and a\n\u2018 lowest severity \u2019 subgroup scoring 0\u20135 on the 6-week\nEPDS (n=1242) based on the approximate median\nscore for the sample. The choice of a cut-point between\n5 and 6 on the EPDS was supported by the finding\nthat 55% (1242\/2241) of EPDS-negative women scored\n0\u20135. Those in the subthreshold subgroup (score 6\u201311)\ndid not benefit significantly more from IG member-\nship as defined by the 6-week EPDS score (0\u20135, com-\npared to 6\u201311) ; a significant intervention by subgroup\ninteraction was not found (z=x0.28, p=0.782)\n(Table 2). The ORs for the effect of HV training in these\ntwo EPDS score subgroups scarcely differed (0.76 and\n0.69 respectively ; Table 2). The results of a similar\ncomparison of low- and high-risk women also show-\ning no difference in effectiveness are available on\nrequest.\nAmong the secondary outcomes of this study, at\n6 months the mean EPDS score in EPDS-negative\nwomen was 5.4 (S.D=4.5) for CAU women and 4.8\n(S.D=4.2) for IG women, a difference of x0.6 (95%\nCI x0.9 to x0.1, p=0.007), which was statistically\nsignificant (p=0.007). This difference remained stat-\nistically significant after adjusting for the same 6-week\nand baseline covariates (p=0.013) (Table 3). A signifi-\ncant difference (p=0.020) in the 6-month CORE-OM\ntotal score favoring the IG women (mean=0.38) over\nCAU women at 6 months was also found (mean=\n0.43) with other outcome comparisons (SF-12 and State\nAnxiety) being not significant. A comparison of out-\ncomes for IG women in the two randomly allocated\n742 T. S. Brugha et al.\ntraining groups (CBA or PCA) also showed no\ndifference in effectiveness : compared to the control\n(CAU) EPDS score, at 6 months the mean EPDS score\nin the CBA group was 4.7 (n=708, S.D=4.2) ; and in the\nPCA group it was 4.9 (n=766, S.D=4.3).\nEPDS-negative women in the face-to-face clinical\nassessment group (n=746) had a lower mean EPDS\nscore at 6 months than women who only received\na postal EPDS (n=728; difference 0.68, 95% CI\n0.25\u20131.20, p=0.002) ; this was of borderline statistical\nsignificance following adjustment (p=0.054). When\ncomparing the binary 6-month EPDS outcomes (EPDS\nscore o12), the differences were not statistically sig-\nnificant (unadjusted p=0.126 ; adjusted p=0.301).\nBecause of trial funding limitations, fewer postal\nquestionnaires were sent to women and thus returned\nat 12 and 18 months (n=807) than at 6 months\n(n=2659). In addition to the 6-week and 6-month re-\nturns, 1450 women also completed and returned a\npostal follow-up at 12 months and 806 at 18 months.\nAt the 12-month follow-up, 9.6% (48\/499) of women\nin the CAU group and 6.8% (65\/951) of women in the\nIG had an EPDS score o12 and an unadjusted OR\nof 0.68 (95% CI 0.44\u20131.05, p=0.079). After adjusting\nfor covariates, the OR was 0.74 (95% CI 0.48\u20131.14,\np=0.167).

S. Brugha et al.\nDiscussion\nOur analysis has shown that women who scored\nbelow the EPDS threshold at 6 weeks after childbirth\nwere less likely to score above the EPDS threshold\nat 6 months after childbirth if their HV had under-\ngone training in identifying depressive symptoms,\ndeveloping therapeutic relationships and providing\npsychological approaches to managing depression.\nFurthermore, this effect applied equally across women\nat all initial levels of risk, not just those close to the\nabove threshold, thus suggesting a universal effect.\nThis effect did not diminish over later assessments at\n12 and 18 months following childbirth. How plausible\nis this effect and can it be explained?\nWe found that the training was effective in the sep-\narately reported treatment trial in EPDS positive\n(EPDS score o12) women (Morrell et al. 2009a),\nalthough 61% agreed to, and only 28% of all EPDS\npositive IG women providing outcome data had\ncompleted, HV sessions. In the present study, ap-\nproximately 1% of IG EPDS-negative women were\noffered and completed at least one session. So we need\nto ask why and how was HV training universally\neffective most notably in the EPDS-negative women?\nCross-contamination effects are likely to have been\nminimized by clustering HVs. One previous primary\ncare trial, using a similarly powered clustered design,\nin which midwives were trained in a protocol to\nfocus on specific physical and mental health needs of\nmothers after childbirth, also reported significantly\nlower EPDS scores at 4 months follow-up in women in\nIG practices (MacArthur et al. 2002). However, there\nwere insufficient baseline data available to identify\nwomen with greater depression severity to determine\nwhether effectiveness was confined to a subgroup of\nlikely cases of depression or was preventive across the\nwhole range of baseline severity.\nWhat seems to matter is the difference between\nbeing registered with a practice that has adopted the\nexperimental versus the CAU policy. This involves\ndifferences in practice environment and culture. More\nspecifically, receiving training and developing the skill\nto assess mental health and provide psychologically\ninformed sessions is likely to affect the practitioners\nthemselves through increased confidence. It creates a\nfocus of care on the mother\u2019s psychological well-being\nand not just on the physical welfare of the child.\nWomen may benefit from the HVs\u2019 enhanced com-\nmunication skills and knowing that emotional issues\nare open for discussion if needed, without the possibly\nstigmatizing requirement to refer to a different pro-\nfession or service. We were able to show evidence in\nthe women who were below threshold at 6 weeks of a\npositive effect of being randomly assigned to receive a\nface-to-face EPDS administration and clinical assess-\nment, when compared with a research office postally\nadministered EPDS questionnaire only. As reported\nseparately, empirical support for change in HV ac-\ntivity was shown in the resource use logs of these\nlower-risk women (Brugha et al. 2009). As the EPDS\nscore increased, in the IGs, a clear increase in the\nTable 2.

The purpose of training\nwas also to establish a high-quality, warm, therapeutic\nrelationship with the women (Morrell et al. 2009b).\nConcepts of social support have been suggested to\nexplain the common underlying mechanisms in the\neffectiveness of cognitive behavioral, interpersonal\nand other therapies (Brugha, 1995). Tailoring to need\nand availability of support from a trained professional\ncould potentially influence perception of available\nsupport, which may be the key parameter, rather than\nobjective support. The value of tailoring and flexible\ncare has certainly been suggested by MacArthur et al.\n(2002), but in that study women were provided care\nfrom midwives and followed only to 4 months post-\nnatally.\nPsychological interventions focusing on inter-\npersonal issues during pregnancy have also shown\nsome promise (Spinelli & Endicott, 2003 ; Zlotnick et al.\n2006). This result contrasts with two previous in-\neffective prevention trials conducted in the same\npopulation by the present authors (T.S.B., C.J.M.) that\nemployed external (research) therapists (Brugha et al.\n2000 ; Morrell et al. 2000). Thus, individually delivered\npsychosocial interventions by professionals may be\nmore effective postnatally (Dennis, 2005) when in-\ntegrated into routine visits. For example, one other\nrandomized trial of enhanced and personalized mid-\nwife-managed care in the early postnatal period also\nreported better EPDS outcomes at 7 weeks postnatally\n(Shields et al. 1997). The similarity of both sets of re-\nsearch findings runs counter to the suggestion that our\nresult is a chance, fortuitous finding.\nStudy limitations need to be considered given\nthe potential public health significance of the results.\nA potential limitation of the study is that the EPDS\nsubgroup by IG interaction tests have limited power\nto detect anything other than large interactions\n(Montgomery et al. 2003). The CI for the OR for the\ninteraction effect at 6 months after adjustment for\ncovariates (0.44\u20131.87) was relatively wide, so we can-\nnot exclude such an effect, although the point estimate\nof the OR of 0.91 suggests this is unlikely. However,\nthe interaction was not of primary interest and the trial\nwas adequately powered to detect a reasonable target\nintervention effect, equivalent to an OR of 0.63. A full\nclinical interview was not performed on all CAU andT\nab\nle\n3.\nS\nix\n-m\non\nth\nse\nco\nn\nda\nry\nou\ntc\nom\nes\nfo\nr\nth\ne\n\u2018E\nP\nD\nS\n-n\neg\nat\niv\ne\nsa\nm\npl\ne\u2019\n(n\n=\n22\n41\n),\nca\nre\nas\nu\nsu\nal\n(C\nA\nU\n)\nv\ner\nsu\ns\nin\nte\nrv\nen\nti\non\ngr\nou\np\n(I\nG\n),\nu\nn\nad\nju\nst\ned\nan\nd\nad\nju\nst\ned\nC\nA\nU\nIG\nU\nn\nad\nju\nst\ned\nA\nd\nju\nst\ned\na\nn\nM\nea\nn\nS\n.D\n.\nn\nM\nea\nn\nS\n.D\n.\nD\niff\ner\nen\nce\n95\n%\nC\nI\np\nD\niff\ner\nen\nce\n95\n%\nC\nI\np\nE\nP\nD\nS\nat\n6\nm\no\nn\nth\ns\n76\n7\n5.\n4\n4.\n5\n14\n74\n4.\n8\n4.\n2\nx\n0.\n6\nx\n1.\n1\nto\nx\n0.\n2\n0.\n00\n7\nx\n0.\n5\nx\n0.\n9\nto\nx\n0.\n1\n0.\n01\n3\nS\nF\n-1\n2\nP\nC\nS\nat\n6\nm\no\nn\nth\ns\n74\n3\n54\n.5\n6.\n3\n14\n31\n55\n.0\n5.\n8\n0.\n5\nx\n0.\n1\nto\n1.\n0\n0.\n09\n3\n0.\n3\nx\n0.\n2\nto\n0.\n9\n0.\n19\n8\nS\nF\n-1\n2\nM\nC\nS\nat\n6\nm\no\nn\nth\ns\n74\n3\n49\n.5\n9.\n1\n14\n31\n50\n.1\n8.\n7\n0.\n7\nx\n0.\n3\nto\n1.\n7\n0.\n16\n5\n0.\n6\nx\n0.\n3\nto\n1.\n5\n0.\n17\n4\nC\nO\nR\nE\n-O\nM\nto\nta\nl\nsc\no\nre\nat\n6\nm\no\nn\nth\ns\n76\n0\n0.\n43\n0.\n43\n14\n67\n0.\n38\n0.\n39\nx\n0.\n05\nx\n0.\n10\nto\nx\n0.\n1\n0.\n02\n0\nx\n0.\n04\nx\n0.\n08\nto\nx\n0.\n00\n0.\n03\n5\nS\nta\nte\nA\nn\nx\nie\nty\nat\n6\nm\no\nn\nth\ns\n72\n2\n32\n.3\n10\n.3\n13\n80\n31\n.6\n9.\n9\nx\n0.\n7\nx\n1.\n9\nto\n0.\n5\n0.\n23\n1\nx\n0.\n7\nx\n1.\n8\nto\n0.\n4\n0.\n23\n6\nE\nP\nD\nS\n,E\nd\nin\nb\nu\nrg\nh\nP\no\nst\nn\nat\nal\nD\nep\nre\nss\nio\nn\nS\nca\nle\n;S\nF\n-1\n2,\n12\n-i\nte\nm\nS\nh\no\nrt\nF\no\nrm\nH\nea\nlt\nh\nS\nu\nrv\ney\n;P\nC\nS\n,p\nh\ny\nsi\nca\nlc\no\nm\np\no\nn\nen\nt\nsu\nm\nm\nar\ny\nsc\nal\ne\n;M\nC\nS\n,m\nen\nta\nlc\no\nm\np\no\nn\nen\nt\nsu\nm\nm\nar\ny\nsc\nal\ne\n;C\nO\nR\nE\n-O\nM\n,\nC\nli\nn\nic\nal\nO\nu\ntc\no\nm\nes\nin\nR\no\nu\nti\nn\ne\nE\nv\nal\nu\nat\nio\nn\n\u2013\nO\nu\ntc\no\nm\ne\nM\nea\nsu\nre\n;\nS\n.D\n.,\nst\nan\nd\nar\nd\nd\nev\nia\nti\no\nn\n;\nC\nI,\nco\nn\nfi\nd\nen\nce\nin\nte\nrv\nal\n.\nB\net\nte\nr\nh\nea\nlt\nh\nre\np\nre\nse\nn\nte\nd\nb\ny\nlo\nw\ner\nsc\no\nre\nin\nC\nO\nR\nE\n-O\nM\n,\nE\nP\nD\nS\n,\nS\nT\nA\nT\nE\nA\nn\nx\nie\nty\n.\nB\net\nte\nr\nh\nea\nlt\nh\nre\np\nre\nse\nn\nte\nd\nb\ny\nh\nig\nh\ner\nsc\no\nre\nin\nS\nF\n-1\n2.\na\nA\nd\nju\nst\ned\nfo\nr\n6-\nw\nee\nk\nE\nP\nD\nS\nsc\no\nre\n,\nli\nv\nes\nal\no\nn\ne,\nh\nis\nto\nry\no\nf\np\no\nst\nn\nat\nal\nd\nep\nre\nss\nio\nn\n(P\nN\nD\n)\nan\nd\nan\ny\nli\nfe\nev\nen\nts\n.\n746 T. S. Brugha et al.\nIG EPDS-negative women and our primary outcome\nwas thus not clinically assessed depression caseness.\nHowever, the EPDS is a well-established, reliable in-\ndicator of likelihood of clinical depression (Gaynes\net al. 2005). Bias may arise with cluster randomization\nbecause individual recruitment occurs after random-\nization (Puffer et al. 2005). According to Table 1, the\nprofiles of IG and CAU women were remarkably bal-\nanced but, nevertheless, our analysis adjusted for key\npredictors of depression outcome. A planned repli-\ncation and extended generalization of findings will be\nneeded in other populations.\nRose (1992) argued that more people would benefit\nfrom a universal intervention. In our treatment trial\n(Morrell et al. 2009b) we found that 31 (11.4%) of 271\nEPDS positive women benefited from intervention.\nIn this prevention analysis, in EPDS-negative women,\n46 (3.1%) of 1474 women benefited. Accordingly,\nthe new intervention policy benefited far more\nwomen in the prevention (EPDS-negative) than in\nthe treatment (EPDS positive) groups. Our finding\nthat mental health benefits did not diminish over\n18 months of follow-up contrasts with the short-term\neffectiveness of depression interventions in general\nand may reflect the ongoing extended contact that\nHVs often have with postnatal women. Additional\nanalyses from this trial showed the probability that the\nintervention is cost-effective at various \u2018 threshold\nvalues \u2019 of a quality-adjusted life year (QALY). In the\nrange of QALY values between \u00a320 000 and \u00a330 000,\nthe probability of the intervention being cost-effective\nis over 99% (Brugha et al. 2009). Thus, costs were\nlower and outcomes better in IG compared to CAU\nwomen, a concept often referred to by economists as\n\u2018dominance \u2019.\nUntil now, governments and policy makers have\nheld back from investing significantly in depression\nprevention programs, arguably because of lack of\nconvincing evidence for policy change and cost. To\ndate, there have been no large-scale trials testing\nwhether universal prevention effects have occurred\nacross a whole population. There is now new evidence\nfor clinically significant, useful and persistent reduc-\ntions in the prevalence of depression in a key part of\nthe population, women following childbirth, which\nrequires further independent evaluation.\nAcknowledgments\nThe trial was commissioned, funded and sponsored\nby the National Health Service (NHS), England,\nR&D Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Pro-\ngramme.
