It is proposed that \nstructure-driven processes are intimately linked to the implementation of font-specific rules \nfor translating visual features into elements of a letter\u2019s structural description. Evidence for \nsuch font tuning comes from studies exploring the impact of font-mixing on reading fluency, \nand from studies showing how the benefits of experience with a novel typeface can generalise \nto letters that have yet to be seen in the typeface. After reviewing this evidence, three new \nexperiments are reported which explore font tuning in the context of the lexical decision task. \nThe time course of font tuning, which is monitored by changing the time interval between \nsuccessive test stimuli, is shown to be sensitive to the overall probability with which \nsuccessive stimuli appear in the same typeface. In addition, font tuning is shown to reflect \nitem-by-item fluctuations in this probability. Finally, the effects of font-switching are shown \nto generalise beyond the particular letters present in the text, and to be confined to 1-back \ntransitions. It is concluded that font tuning reflects the implementation of a set of font-specific \ntranslation rules held in working memory, and is moderated by the reader\u2019s implicit \nknowledge of the constraints present in the sequencing of successive portions of text. \nKeywords: word reading, letter identification, typeface, font tuning, implicit knowledge of \ntypographic variation.      \n  Font Tuning 3 \nFont Tuning: A Review and New Experimental Evidence \n Words can be encoded visually in different ways during reading, thereby providing \ninitial access to different types of representation in memory. For example, a printed word can \nbe encoded as a 2-D visual pattern (image), and word identification can proceed by finding a \nmatching visual pattern in memory. Studies manipulating the visual format of text (e.g., by \nmixing letter case) have confirmed that encoding the visual patterns created by multi-letter \nstrings can enhance reading fluency (e.g., Braet & Humphreys, 2006; Hall, Humphreys, & \nCooper, 2001; Lete & Pynte, 2003; Martens & de Jong, 2006; Mayall & Humphreys, 1996; \nMayall et al., 2001; Mayall, Humphreys, & Olson, 1997; Whiteley & Walker, 1994; 1997). \n Alternatively, a printed word can be encoded as a set of visual cues to the underlying \nstructure of the word, and word identification can proceed by finding a matching structural \ndescription in memory. Deriving a structural description for a word requires the \ncorresponding visual cues to be discriminated (and irrelevant cues ignored), and for these to \nbe translated into a structural description according to a set of rules for doing so. Though, in \nprinciple, the units of analysis for structure-based word identification can be anything from \nindividual letters to whole words, they are normally considered to be individual letters. \nFigure 1 illustrates one conceptualisation of word reading that incorporates pattern-driven \nand structure-driven elements. \n________________ \nFigure 1 about here \n________________ \n Several recent studies provide evidence confirming that words can be identified \nduring reading by discriminating the underlying structure of their component letters. In \nparticular, Sanocki has provided evidence confirming that the visual cues readers use to \nderive the underlying structure of letters, and the rules they implement to achieve this, are \n  Font Tuning 4 \nadjusted according to the typeface in which text appears (e.g., Sanocki, 1987; 1988; 1991; \n1992). Further evidence for such font tuning has been provided recently by Gauthier, Wong, \nHayward, & Cheung (2006).  \n This recent evidence for font tuning prompted the author to attempt three things in the \npresent paper. First, to reflect on the types of evidence able to confirm that letter and word \nidentification can be structure-based, and not just pattern-based. Second, to review existing \nevidence providing some confirmation of this. And third, to present three experiments \nyielding preliminary evidence regarding the time course of font tuning, and the extent to \nwhich this is under a reader\u2019s strategic control. Because much of the existing evidence hinges \non format repetition effects in word reading, the author also provides a review of evidence for \npattern-based repetition effects in reading, and identifies the factors determining when these \nare, and are not, expected to be observed (e.g., word and n-gram frequency, and typeface \ndistinctiveness). This review, which appears in the Appendix, permits the reader to \nunderstand better how format repetition effects reflecting structure-based encoding can be \ndistinguished from those reflecting pattern-based encoding. \nFonts, font tuning, and letter identification \n The surface form of a piece of text can vary markedly according to the typeface in \nwhich it appears. When presented in a novel and distinctive typeface, the surface appearance \nof the words will differ from anything seen before. Despite this, reading is likely to proceed \nrelatively unhindered, indicating that words can be identified on the basis of their underlying \nvisual structure, which remains in place despite the superimposition of font-specific visual \nfeatures.  \n The underlying structure of a letter comprises a set of component forms, which we \nmight call strokes, and the spatial arrangement of these strokes. Letter structure is defined in \n  Font Tuning 5 \nabstract, categorical terms, such as TWO LONG VERTICAL STROKES PLUS A \nHORIZONTAL CONNECTING STROKE PART-WAY UP, for the most common version \nof the capital letter H. A little reflection will confirm that some letters of the alphabet \nnormally have a different structural description for their uppercase and lowercase forms (e.g., \nAa, Gg, Qq), whereas others retain the same structure regardless of case, differing only in \nrelative size (e.g., Oo, Ss, Vv, Xx, Zz). By cultural convention, each letter of the alphabet has \na prototypical structural description, and typefaces that adhere closely to these (e.g., \nHelvetica) are the most frequently used in publications for continuous reading (e.g., \nnewspapers and novels), and in publications designed for children who are learning to read. \nThese typefaces also tend to be free of decorative visual features that are irrelevant with \nregard to communicating a letter\u2019s underlying structure. \n________________ \nFigure 2 about here \n________________ \n When a typographer creates a typeface, they create a set of rules for translating the \nprototypical structural features of every letter of the alphabet into a printed surface form. \nAdopting the same set of translation rules for all letters of the alphabet gives a typeface a \nconsistent and coherent appearance regardless of the particular text being realised. The reader \nhas the task of discovering the translation rules for the text they are reading, and engaging \nwith them in the reverse direction, so that they can go from the surface forms of letters to \ndescriptions of their underlying structure, allowing the letters to be identified. In the case of \ndisplay fonts (i.e., fonts designed for other than continuous reading), typographers will often \nadd visual features to make a typeface appropriate for use in a particular context (e.g., \nLaughin Plain, Rodeo Roundup, and Toy Blocks, illustrated in Figure 2). Such visual \nfeatures, the most obvious of which is color, do not provide cues regarding underlying letter \n  Font Tuning 6 \nstructure, and so readers, when they engage with a new piece of text, have the immediate task \nof deciding which visual features are diagnostic of letter structure, and which are not. \n________________ \nFigure 3 about here \n________________ \n The translation rules embedded in a typeface need to specify a range of surface visual \nfeatures that will provide readers with cues about the underlying structure of each letter. For \nexample, some rules will specify how individual strokes are to be realised in surface form \nand, as Figure 3 illustrates, the range of possibilities is vast. Other rules will specify how \nVERTICAL and HORIZONTAL in a letter\u2019s structural description are to be realised in \nsurface form. For regular fonts, VERTICAL in a letter\u2019s structural description will translate \ninto vertical on the page, where this is defined by the letter\u2019s immediate visual environment \n(including the edges of the page and, most notably, the virtual lines on which the text is \narranged). For some fonts, however, the translation of VERTICAL is not so transparent, and \nthis is the case with italic fonts. For other fonts, the translation of VERTICAL and \nHORIZONTAL is more complex (see, for example, Buster, Youngsook, Dimentia Black, and \nToyBox Blocks, in Figure 4). In Buster, letters are depicted as 3-D structures lying face up on \na flat surface, and this sets the scene for an unusual translation of VERTICAL onto the page. \nIn Youngsook, HORIZONTAL strokes are realised by visual features that are consistently \nslanted on the page. And in Dimentia Black and ToyBox Blocks, where letters are depicted as \nfacets of objects that are variously oriented in 3-D space, VERTICAL and HORIZONTAL \nare specified on a letter-by-letter basis, largely according to each object\u2019s intrinsic spatial \nframe of reference. \n \n \n  Font Tuning 7 \n________________ \nFigure 4 about here \n________________ \n It seems likely that the structural descriptions for many letters incorporate more \nfeatures than need be explicitly represented in their surface form for them to be identified \n(e.g., see Schomaker & Segers, 1999). As a result, identifying a letter probably will not \nrequire all of the elements in its structural description to be reflected in its surface form, and \ndifferent fonts will make different elements more or less evident. For example, the \nprototypical structural descriptions of some letters will include a specification that certain of \ntheir strokes are CURVED, and that these connect with other strokes to create an \nENCLOSED SPACE (e.g., as in the letter P). However, for some fonts, CURVED in a \nstructural description does not translate into curved in a letter\u2019s printed form, because the \nfonts utilise straight contours exclusively (see, for example, Displayced JNL and Pixel D, in \nFigure 5). These fonts require readers to suspend their reliance on the curvature of contours \nas a cue to the curvature of a letter\u2019s underlying structural elements, and to rely exclusively \non other cues to the letter\u2019s identity. Similarly, in some fonts (e.g., stencil fonts), the points of \ncontact between different structural elements of a letter are not always explicitly realised in \nits surface form, and so any elements of the structural description making reference to AN \nENCLOSED SPACE will not be so clearly signalled in print (see, for example, Advera \nStencil and Suchow, in Figure 5). And, as a final example, elements of a letter\u2019s structural \ndescription concerning the points of termination of its strokes are not always explicitly \nrepresented in the surface form of a typeface, as in the case of some script fonts (e.g., Lucida \nHandwriting). Again, therefore, the reader will need to assign less weight to visual features \nthat would normally signal the presence\/absence of these structural features, and more weight \nto other visual features, such as the presence and locations of ascenders and descenders. \n  Font Tuning 8 \nIndeed, Schomaker and Segers (1999) have demonstrated that whereas removing the visual \nfeatures signalling the presence of ascenders and descenders does not impede the reading of \ntyped text, it does impede the reading of handwriting. In addition, they illustrate that blurring \ntyped text also can increase a reader\u2019s reliance on visual features signalling the presence of \nascenders and descenders. Thus, when text is blurred, it becomes more difficult to read words \nthat share their pattern of ascenders and descenders with many other words, than to read \nwords with a unique pattern of ascenders and descenders.  \n________________ \nFigure 5 about here \n________________ \n An isolated letter appearing in a novel and distinctive typeface is unlikely to provide \nthe reader with sufficient information to distinguish diagnostic from non-diagnostic visual \nfeatures, or to deduce the full set of translation rules embedded in the typeface. Where the \nevidence is not sufficient, readers will have to apply a frequently utilised (default) set of rules \nwhich might, or might not, lead to correct letter identification. However, as additional letters \nof the alphabet are made available to the reader, the translation rules will become more \napparent. We can appreciate one reason, therefore, why typographers normally adopt the \nsame translation rules for every letter of the alphabet, and why presenting letters in the \ncontext of other letters in the same typeface aids letter identification. For example, the reader \nmight find that the letters in Figure 6 are more difficult to identify when they appear in the \ncontext of a mix of fonts, than when they appear in the context of a single font (see Gauthier \net al., 2006, for evidence). \n________________ \nFigure 6 about here \n________________ \n  Font Tuning 9 \n \nStructure-based letter identification: Font tuning and font-specific \nrepetition effects. \n When a reader begins to read a piece of text presented in a novel and distinctive \ntypeface, a first requirement is that they pick up the translation rules embedded in the \ntypeface. They will need to determine which visual features are diagnostic of letter structure, \nwhat the translation rules are, and how they should be differentially weighted. While they are \ndoing this, reading is likely to proceed more slowly, and to be more error prone, than would \nbe the case with a familiar typeface. Even when the text a reader begins to read appears in a \ndistinctive typeface that is familiar, reading fluency might be expected to be temporarily \nreduced until a previously assembled set of translation rules is retrieved from long-term \nmemory (assuming translation rules are preserved in long-term memory). Despite such a \ntemporary reduction in reading fluency, we can see how the availability in long-term memory \nof previously used translation rules will allow readers to be more fluent (less impeded) when \nbeginning to read text appearing in a familiar typeface, than when beginning to read text \nappearing in an unfamiliar typeface. It seems reasonable to assume that the set of translation \nrules for a familiar typeface will take less time to retrieve from long-term memory than to \ndiscover afresh.  \nPattern-based accounts of visual word identification also predict that reading will be \ntemporarily impaired when text appears in an unfamiliar typeface (see the Appendix for a \nreview). It must be asked, therefore, how the effects arising from structure-based processes \nmight be distinguished from those arising from pattern-based processes. One possibility is \nthat the time course of the effects will differ. Although it is difficult to be specific, it is \npossible that it will take longer to accumulate a collection of font-specific visual patterns for \n  Font Tuning 10 \na novel typeface, that is large enough to impact significantly on reading, than to discover the \nfont-specific translation rules embedded in the typeface. On this basis, reading fluency would \nbe expected to recover to the levels associated with a familiar typeface more quickly when \nthe recovery is mediated by structure-based processes rather than pattern-based processes. \nStructure-based and pattern-based processes in word identification have different \nimplications for the extent to which reading text in a novel typeface can yield benefits that \nwill extend to textual elements that have yet to be seen in the typeface. If we consider a rather \nextreme situation, in which experience with a new typeface is restricted to a subset of the \nletters of the alphabet, then it is clear that any benefits gained from accumulating visual \npatterns linked to the typeface will largely be restricted to the patterns that have been \nencountered, and so will not generalise to new letters. In contrast, given that typographers \ndesign typefaces with the same translation rules applying to all letters of the alphabet, then at \nleast some of the benefits gained from experiencing a subset of letters should generalise to \nnew letters. \n Structure-based and pattern-based processes in word identification also have differing \nimplications regarding the impact on reading fluency of switching typefaces across \nsuccessive portions of text (e.g., successive letters, words, sentences). If switching between \nfamiliar, rather than unfamiliar, typefaces is considered, then all the visual patterns created by \nthe text will be available in long-term memory, regardless of the nature of any typeface \nswitching that might be occurring. Because of this, the cost to reading fluency arising from \ntypeface switching is expected to be minimal as far as pattern-based processes are concerned. \nHowever, for structure-based processes, each change in typeface will require the translation \nrules in current use to be replaced with rules retrieved from long-term memory (assuming \nthat only one set of translation rules can be in current use). While this is happening, reading \n  Font Tuning 11 \nfluency will be temporarily impaired. Furthermore, although there will be costs associated \nwith each switch from one familiar typeface to another, there will be no costs associated with \nany earlier switches (i.e., typeface transition effects will be confined to 1-back transitions). In \naddition, the cost to reading fluency will not diminish with practice reading text in which font \nswitching occurs, because there will always be the same need to retrieve the appropriate \ntranslation rules from long-term memory. Finally, the degree of similarity among the \ntypefaces being switched should be influential. Thus, where the typefaces are very similar, it \nis possible that the same translation rules will be able to continue to support fluent reading. \nHowever, where the typefaces are very dissimilar, the same translation rules will not be able \nto sustain letter identification, and some cost to reading fluency will be experienced. In other \nwords, not only does a structure-based account predict costs associated with switching fonts, \nit also predicts different levels of cost according to the dissimilarity of the fonts being \nswitched. \n   Several studies provide evidence bearing on these arguments. For example, Sanocki \n(1991) required participants to identify the letters contained in a briefly presented string of \nletters. He demonstrated that changing the typeface between blocks of trials impeded \nperformance. Sanocki (1992) refined this study by arranging for experience with an unusual \nfont to be confined to a subset of letters. The subset of letters from which letter strings were \ngenerated was then switched after a block of trials. In one condition, the same typeface was \nretained for both blocks of trials, whereas in a second condition the typeface also was \nchanged. The question of most interest in the present context was whether any benefits from \nexperiencing the typeface in the first block generalised to letters that had yet to be seen in that \ntypeface (i.e., whether there was a font-specific, but letter-independent, enhancement of \nreading). The answer appears to be yes. Thus, although there was a temporary impairment to \n  Font Tuning 12 \nreading fluency associated with switching to a new set of letters in the same typeface, this \nwas less pronounced than the impairment observed when the typeface also was changed. In \nother words, there was evidence that the benefits gained from experiencing the novel \ntypeface in the first block of trials generalised to letters that had yet to be seen in the \ntypeface. This is just what would be expected if participants were becoming familiar with the \ntranslation rules embedded in the typeface. It is not what would be expected if the font-\nspecific enhancement of reading arose exclusively from the accumulation in long-term \nmemory of records of the visual patterns created by different elements of text. \n Corcoran and Rouse (1970) asked their participants to identify each of a succession of \nindividual words presented tachistoscopically. Each word appeared either in a regular \ntypeface (not specified by the researchers), or in handwriting. In one condition, all the words \ncreated in a particular format appeared within the same block of trials. In a second condition, \nthe format changed frequently and unpredictably from one word to the next. Corcoran and \nRouse observed poorer levels of identification when the format of the text changed from one \nword to the next. Klitz, Mansfield, and Legge (1995) required readers to read short passages \nas quickly as possible. Each passage could appear entirely in one of two typefaces, or in a \nmix of two typefaces, with the typefaces switching across successive words. Five distinctive \ntypefaces were used, and all possible pairings of the typefaces were used to generate the \nmixed-typeface passages. Klitz et al. observed reading to be slowed when a passage appeared \nin a mix of typefaces, and the extent of the interference with reading reflected the degree to \nwhich the typefaces being mixed were dissimilar to each other. \n In two experiments, Gauthier et al. (2006) required participants to read a matrix of \n100 letters as quickly as possible. In one condition, all the letters in each row of the matrix \nappeared in the same unfamiliar typeface, but the font changed to a new one for each \n  Font Tuning 13 \nsuccessive row. In a second condition, the allocation of a typeface to a letter was not \nconstrained by row in this way, but was random. As a result, participants had many more \nchanges in typeface to contend with as they scanned the letters in a left-right\/top-bottom \nmanner. Gauthier et al. observed slower reading times in the second condition, where readers \nhad to deal with more switches between typefaces. In a further experiment, in which \nparticipants read letter triplets, Gauthier et al. used just two typefaces, and designed these to \ndiffer with regard to specific letter features. For example, one pair of typefaces differed only \nin their aspect ratio, whereas another pair differed only with regard to the orientation of \nVERTICAL strokes (i.e., whether these were tilted clockwise or anticlockwise on the page). \nGauthier et al. again observed font mixing to impair reading fluency, and this was most \nmarked when the typefaces differed in their aspect ratio. \n Sanocki (1987, 1988) required participants to identify the letters contained in a briefly \npresented string. The letters within a string (typically four) could appear in one of two \ntypefaces. In one condition, the four letters within a string appeared in the same font. In a \nsecond (mixed) condition, two letters appeared in each of the two fonts. Sanocki observed \nletter identification to be impaired by font mixing, and the degree of impairment did not \ndiminish with practice. This is consistent with the idea that the cost associated with switching \ntypefaces emanates from the need to replace the current translation rules with rules retrieved \nfrom long-term memory, a need that should not diminish with practice at the task. \nFurthermore, with regard to situations in which all the letters in a string appeared in the same \ntypeface, Sanocki confirmed that letter identification was also impeded when the font \nchanged between trials, confirming that tuning to a particular font can remain in place for at \nleast some time after the corresponding text has been removed from view. Finally, in a \nfurther experiment, Sanocki selected pairs of fonts that differed to varying extents with \n  Font Tuning 14 \nregard to one of a number of specific letter features (e.g., length of ascenders and descenders \nrelative to the x-height, and whether letter loops were curved or square). The detrimental \neffect of font mixing increased as the difference between the fonts increased. \n To conclude, it is possible to reveal structure-driven effects on reading fluency, and to \ndistinguish these from pattern-driven effects. The best evidence thus far for structure-based \neffects on reading fluency comes from studies examining the effect of font-switching across \nsuccessive portions of text, and from studies showing how the benefits of experience with a \nnovel typeface can generalise to letters that have yet to be seen in the typeface. Clearly, \nhowever, further work is required to confirm the reality of font tuning, and to clarify its \nmodus operandi. The experiments reported below provide evidence regarding the time course \nof font tuning, and the extent to which this is under a reader\u2019s strategic control. \nExperiment 1 \n A question concerning font tuning that has yet to be addressed is the focus of the three \nexperiments reported here. The question is, under what circumstances, if any, will the \ntranslation rules applied to the most recent portion of text be retained in working memory for \nimplementation with the next portion of text? One extreme possibility is that their retention \nfor this purpose is obligatory, regardless of the time elapsing before the next portion of text is \nencountered, and regardless of the potential utility of re-implementing them (e.g., regardless \nof the probability that the next portion of text will appear in the same typeface). Another \npossibility is that readers have some control over the retention of translation rules in working \nmemory. If so, and if their retention is judged not to be useful, then some additional questions \narise. Will readers remove the translation rules from working memory, and how quickly will \nthis take effect? And if they abandon the rules, will they replace them with a default set of \nrules (perhaps corresponding to a prototypical typeface), or will they not replace them, so that \n  Font Tuning 15 \nno rules will be available in working memory for implementation with the next portion of \ntext? \n In the first two experiments, a situation was created in which there was little incentive \nfor participants to retain the current translation rules for re-implementation with the next \nportion of text. This was achieved by arranging for portions of text to appear with equal \nprobability in either of two typefaces, and for immediately successive portions of text to be \nequally likely to appear in the same typeface, or in alternative typefaces. Will the translation \nrules applied to one portion of text be removed from working memory before the next portion \nof text is dealt with? And if so, how quickly will this occur? Specifically, as the time \nseparating successive portions of text is increased, will the effects of font-switching \ndisappear, and how quickly will this happen?   \n Experiment 1 explored a situation in which the temporal separation between \nsuccessive portions of text was minimal. That is, different portions of text appeared \nsimultaneously on the same page (screen). Participants were presented with a test stimulus \nthat was either a word or a pseudoword, along with a string of consonants. These two stimuli \nappeared one above the other, and it was unpredictable which stimulus would appear in the \nupper\/lower of the two spatial locations used throughout. Participants had to refrain from \nresponding to the consonant string, and decide if the test stimulus was a word or pseudoword. \nIt was assumed that the two stimuli appearing together would be dealt with separately, and \nthat on a significant proportion of trials the consonant string would be dealt with first. In light \nof Sanocki\u2019s observations regarding the impact of font-mixing on the identification of letters \nin a string, font-mixing was expected to have a detrimental effect on responses to the \nword\/pseudoword.  \n \n  Font Tuning 16 \nMethod \n Words and pseudowords were presented as stimuli in the lexical decision task. A set \nof 128 words was selected from the MCW Orthographic Word Form Database \n(www.neuro.mcw.edu\/wordgen\/). The words were 6 and 7 letters long, and had high \nfrequency counts (120 - 2000 per million). Because all the words and pseudowords were to \nappear entirely in lowercase, proper nouns were not included. The pseudowords were created \nby changing one letter (and very occasionally two letters) in each of a comparable set of 128 \nlow frequency words (30 \u2013 35 per million). The non-words so created were orthographically \nlegal and pronounceable. \n________________ \nFigure 7 about here \n________________ \n Each of the 256 test stimuli appeared in one of two familiar, but dissimilar, typefaces: \nCooper Black and Palatino Italic (see Figure 7). The assignment of one of these typefaces to \neach word\/pseudoword was undertaken on a random basis, with the constraint that half the \nwords and half the pseudowords appeared in each typeface. A complementary set of 256 test \nstimuli was created by arranging for each word and pseudoword to appear in the other \ntypeface, and the two sets of test stimuli were equally likely to be selected for a participant.  \n Each word\/pseudoword appeared together with a string of consonants. Participants \nwere instructed to ignore the consonant string, and to respond to the lexical status of the \nword\/pseudoword. Each consonant string comprised a random selection of consonants, and \nthe number of consonants matched the number of letters in the word\/pseudoword it \naccompanied. The consonant string appeared in either one of the two typefaces, and this was \nequally likely to match, or mismatch, the typeface in which the word\/pseudoword appeared. \nThe word\/pseudoword and consonant string selected for a trial appeared in black, one above \n  Font Tuning 17 \nthe other in the centre of an otherwise white screen, separated vertically by 5 mm, and each \nwith an x-height of 4 mm. The average length of the words was 2.0 cm which, with a viewing \ndistance of 70 cm, corresponds to 1.67 deg of visual angle. The word\/pseudoword was \nequally likely to appear in the upper or lower of the two locations used throughout. Thus, in a \n2 x 2 x 2 x 2 within-participants design, the following four factors were combined \northogonally: lexical category of the test stimulus, the typeface in which the test stimulus \nappeared, the typeface in which the consonant string appeared, and whether the \nword\/pseudoword appeared in the upper or lower of the two spatial locations. \n Stimulus presentation and response monitoring utilised PsyScript (an in-house \nexperiment generator written by S. Slavin, www.psych.lancs.ac.uk\/software\/psyScript), \nrunning on an Apple PowerMac G5 (Dual 2GHz), with a 20 inch flat cinema screen. \nGenerated in this way, the visual quality of the text approached the levels achieved with \nprinted materials. Each display remained visible until participants made their lexical decision \nby pressing one of two keys (i.e., the \u2018z\u2019 or \u2018\/\u2019 key). Assignment of word and pseudoword \nresponses to the left or right hand was counterbalanced across participants. The stimuli were \nremoved from view immediately participants responded, and a blank interstimulus interval \n(ISI) elapsed before the next pair of stimuli appeared. The ISI was set at 0.75 s. No feedback \nwas provided regarding the accuracy of each response. Following four practice trials, each \nparticipant completed two blocks of 128 trials each, separated by a brief rest interval, with an \nequal number of words and pseudowords appearing in each typeface in each block. The order \nin which the test stimuli appeared was randomised on-line, and was different for each \nparticipant. \n \n \n  Font Tuning 18 \nParticipants \n Twelve female and four male undergraduate and postgraduate students from \nLancaster University completed the experiment. Their ages ranged from 19 to 24 years, and \nEnglish was their first language.  \n________________ \nTable 1 about here \n________________ \nResults \n The overall error rate was 7.8%, and the average correct reaction time (RT) was 983 \nms. The main thrust of the analyses in this and the experiments to follow concerned RTs. RTs \nassociated with incorrect responses were excluded from the analyses, and a cut-off value was \nset at 2 SDs above a participant\u2019s average correct RT. RTs exceeding this were replaced with \nthe cut-off value. Though the error rates were relatively low, these also were analysed. An \nalpha level of 0.05 was used for all statistical tests. \nEffects across successive trials.  \n Reaction time. The only transition effect across successive trials (screens) that was \nsignificant involved the spatial location of the word\/pseudoword and, specifically, whether \nthis was the same or different across successive trials. A two-way ANOVA was conducted, \nwith the spatial location of the current word\/pseudoword (upper location vs. lower location), \nand its location relative to the location of the preceding word\/pseudoword (same location vs. \ndifferent location) as within-participants factors. The main effect of current spatial location \nwas significant, F (1,15) = 29.87, MSE = 31, \u03b7p2 = .67, p < .001, with participants responding \nmore quickly when words\/pseudowords appeared in the upper location than when they \nappeared in the lower location (M = 955 and 999, respectively). The main effect of relative \nlocation across successive trials also was significant, F (1,15) = 12.12, MSE = 22, \u03b7p2 = .45, p \n  Font Tuning 19 \n= .003, with participants responding more quickly when the current word\/pseudoword \nappeared in the same location as the immediately preceding word\/pseudoword (M = 958 and \n996, respectively). Finally, there was a significant interaction between these two factors, F \n(1,15) = 9.82, MSE = 6, \u03b7p2 = .40, p = .007. This interaction is summarised in Table 1, from \nwhich it can be seen that after responding to a word\/pseudoword in the upper location, \nparticipants remained set to respond to a further test stimulus in that location. However, after \nresponding to a word\/pseudoword in the lower location, participants\u2019 attention was set more \nequitably across the two locations, perhaps because it was being directed at the centre of the \nscreen in preparation for the next display, or because, coincidentally, it was passing over the \ncentre of the screen on its way to the upper location just as the next display appears. These \neffects of the spatial location of the word\/pseudoword on response speed help to confirm that \nparticipants dealt separately with the consonant string and word\/pseudoword and, on a \nsignificant proportion of trials at least, interrogated the consonant string before responding to \nthe word\/pseudoword. \n Accuracy. In this and all subsequent analyses of performance accuracy, the outcome \nwas the same whether or not the data were first subjected to arcsine transformation. In this \ninstance, analysis of accuracy failed to confirm the significance of either factor, or the \ninteraction between them. \n________________ \nTable 2 about here \n________________ \nEffects within a trial.  \n Reaction time. A three-way ANOVA was conducted, with the spatial location of the \ntest stimulus, the lexical category of the test stimulus (word vs. pseudoword), and typeface \ncorrespondence (i.e., whether the test stimulus and the consonant string appeared in the same \n  Font Tuning 20 \ntypeface or in different typefaces), as within-participants factors. The main effect of lexical \ncategory was significant, F (1,15) = 65.19, MSE = 122, \u03b7p2 = .81, p < .001, reflecting the fact \nthat participants responded more quickly to words than to pseudowords (M = 885 and 1080 \nms, respectively). In addition, the main effect of typeface correspondence was significant, F \n(1,15) = 8.22, MSE = 26, \u03b7p2 = .35, p = .012, reflecting the fact that participants responded \nmore quickly when the word\/pseudoword appeared in the same typeface as the consonant \nstring, rather than in a different typeface (M = 969 and 997 ms, respectively). There was no \ninteraction between typeface correspondence and lexical category, F < 1, confirming that \ntypeface correspondence had the same effect for words and pseudowords (Table 2). \n Accuracy. Analysis of accuracy confirmed a significant main effect of lexical \ncategory, F (1,15) = 21.18, MSE = 0.11, \u03b7p2 = .59, p < .001, with participants responding \nmore accurately to words than to pseudowords, (M = 95 and 89%, respectively). No other \nmain effects or interactions were significant. \n Letter overlap. A supplementary analysis of the RTs examined the extent to which the \neffect of font correspondence was contingent on the consonant string and word\/pseudoword \nsharing some of their constituent letters. The procedure to determine how many letters were \nshared by the two stimuli did not take within-string position into account, and trials where \nthere were no letters shared by the two stimuli were contrasted with trials where there was at \nleast one letter shared by the two stimuli. The former trials are referred to as no overlap trials, \nthe latter as overlap trials. This analysis was feasible because there were a sufficient number \nof trials (n = 74) where the word\/pseudoword and consonant string had no letters in common. \n(The percentage of trials involving 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 letters in common was 29, 42.4, 19.6, 8.2, \nand 0.8, respectively.)  A two-way ANOVA was conducted, with typeface correspondence \nand letter overlap (no overlap vs. overlap) as within-participants factors. There was a \n  Font Tuning 21 \nsignificant main effect of letter overlap, F (1,15) = 5.64, MSE = 7.4, \u03b7p2 = .27, p = .03, \nreflecting the fact that participants responded more quickly when some letters were shared by \nthe word\/pseudoword and the consonant string, than when no letters were shared by them (M \n= 965 and 986, respectively). Importantly, however, there was no interaction between \ntypeface correspondence and letter overlap, F < 1. \nDiscussion \n Although only the word\/pseudoword had to be responded to overtly, as a test stimulus \nin the lexical decision task, the consonant string had to be identified as such, at least on those \ntrials where it was interrogated first and a decision made to ignore it. Participants were \nslower to respond when the two letter strings appeared in different typefaces, than when they \nappeared in the same typeface. This suggests that participants were having to adjust to a \nchange in typeface as they switched from considering the consonant string to considering the \nword\/pseudoword. \n The outcome of a supplementary analysis of participants\u2019 performance provided some \nconfirmation that the effects of font-mixing reflected the implementation of font-specific \ntranslation rules associated with the structure-based processing of letters. Thus, displays \nvaried according to whether the word\/pseudoword shared letters with the accompanying \nconsonant string, and the impact of this on lexical decision times was assessed. Structure-\nbased processing would not be expected to be especially sensitive to the presence of letter \noverlap, because the same translation rules can be signalled by different letters of the \nalphabet. Notwithstanding the caution always required when responding to a null result, the \nfact that the impact of font-mixing on lexical decision times was insensitive to letter overlap \nis consistent with the involvement of structure-based letter processing.  \n \n  Font Tuning 22 \nExperiment 2 \n Experiment 2 was designed to assess how the impact of font-switching on reading \nfluency is sensitive to the time interval separating successive portions of text. This was \nachieved by presenting words\/pseudowords individually (i.e., without being accompanied by \na consonant string), and by arranging for the ISI to be set at either 0.75 s (i.e., the same as in \nExperiment 1), or 0.1 s, for different groups of participants. The sets of words and \npseudowords were extended to include 140 examples of each. The number of trials across \nwhich successive words and pseudowords had no letters in common was too low (mean n = \n23, corresponding to 8%) to sustain the same analysis of letter overlap reported for \nExperiment 1. \nParticipants \n Fourteen female and seven male undergraduate and postgraduate students from \nLancaster University completed the experiment. Their ages ranged from 19 to 32 years, and \nEnglish was their first language. Eleven participants were assigned, at random, to the 0.75 s \nISI condition, and 10 participants were assigned to the 0.1 s ISI condition. \n________________ \nTable 3 about here \n________________ \nResults \n The overall error rate was 4.5 %, and the average correct RT was 678 ms. \nReaction time \n A four-way ANOVA was conducted, with ISI (short vs. long) as a between-\nparticipants factor, and with typeface transition (same typeface vs. different typeface across \nsuccessive trials), lexical category transition (same lexical category vs. different lexical \n  Font Tuning 23 \ncategory across successive trials), and lexical category (word vs. pseudoword), as within-\nparticipants factors.  \n The only factor yielding a significant main effect was lexical category, F (1,19) = \n69.83, MSE = 39.8, \u03b7p2 = .79, p < .001, with participants responding more quickly to words \nthan to pseudowords (M = 629 and 726 ms, respectively). Though the main effect of typeface \ntransition was not significant, F (1,19) = 2.35, MSE = 16.6, \u03b7p2 = .11, p = .14, typeface \ntransition interacted significantly with ISI, F (1,19) = 6.90, MSE = 4.9, \u03b7p2 = .27, p = .017 (cf. \nTable 3A). This interaction arose because typeface transition had a significant effect at the \nshorter ISI, F (1,9) = 8.31, MSE = 5.8, \u03b7p2 = .48, p = .018, but not at the longer ISI, F < 1. \nFinally, at the shorter ISI, typeface transition did not interact with lexical category, F < 1. \nThe facilitation due to typeface correspondence measured 15 and 19 ms for words and \npseudowords, respectively. \n The Typeface Transition X Lexical Category Transition interaction was significant, F \n(1,19) = 16.59, MSE = 11.5, \u03b7p2 = .47, p = .001, reflecting the fact that participants responded \nmore quickly when the same\/different status of the typeface transition agreed with the \nsame\/different status of the lexical category transition (i.e., both same or both different), than \nwhen they disagreed (i.e., when one transition was same, and the other was different) (cf. \nTable 3B). The three way interaction with ISI was marginally significant, p = .11, reflecting \nthe fact that though the Typeface Transition X Lexical Category Transition interaction was \nsignificant at the longer ISI, F (1,10) = 23.53, MSE = 12.0, \u03b7p2 = .70, p = .001, it was not \nsignificant at the shorter ISI, F (1,9) = 2.13, MSE = 19.0, \u03b7p2 = .19, p = .18. \nAccuracy \n With regard to performance accuracy, there was no effect of typeface transition, and \nno interaction between this and ISI, F < 1 in both cases.  \n  Font Tuning 24 \nDiscussion \n The results reveal that the cost to reading fluency associated with switching fonts \nacross successive words\/pseudowords was removed when the time interval separating them \nwas extended from 0.1 to 0.75 s. If we assume that the impact of font-switching reflects the \ninappropriateness of carrying forward the typeface translation rules from the immediately \npreceding text, then the results indicate that these rules are removed from working memory \nshortly after the corresponding text has been responded to and\/or removed from view. The \nresults are mute with regard to whether their removal is obligatory or under stategic control. \nIn Experiment 2, there was little incentive to retain the translation rules, since successive \nportions of text were as likely to appear in different typefaces as to appear in the same \ntypeface. Additional work is needed to assess the extent to which readers have control over \nthe retention and implementation of translation rules in working memory, and this is the \nfocus of Experiment 3. \n When typeface transition and lexical category transition were in agreement (i.e., both \nsignalled no change to the status of the stimulus\/response, or both signalled change), \nparticipants responded more quickly than when they were in disagreement (i.e., one signalled \nchange, the other no change). One way of describing this effect is to say that participants \nwere slower to repeat the same response across successive trials when the typeface changed, \nand slower to change their response across successive trials when the typeface remained the \nsame. The fact that this change signals effect was significant in the longer ISI condition \nconfirms that, despite the absence of a main effect of typeface transition with the longer ISI, a \nrecord of the visual appearance of each preceding test stimulus was still available in memory. \nThus, the absence of a font-switching effect at the longer ISI is not due to participants having \nno memory for the first of the two typefaces. \n  Font Tuning 25 \nExperiment 3 \n The absence of a font-switching effect in the 0.75 s ISI condition of Experiment 2 \ncontrasts with Sanocki\u2019s (1987, 1988) observation that font-switching between blocks of \ntrials impairs reading fluency. One way of reconciling these results is to assume that readers \ncan exercise control of the retention and re-implementation of font-specific translation rules, \nand that whereas there was incentive to exercise such control in Sanocki\u2019s study, there was \nno such incentive in Experiment 2.  \n To provide an initial assessment of the degree to which readers have strategic control \nof the retention of font-specific translation rules in working memory, Experiment 2 was \nrepeated, but with changes to the stimulus sequencing. The revised sequencing was designed \nto provide participants with extra incentive to carry the translation rules forward from one \ntest stimulus to the next. This was achieved by arranging for a typeface to be retained for a \nrun of 3 or 4 successive stimuli before font-switching occurred. Because run lengths of 3 and \n4 were equally frequent, each of the two typefaces was more likely to be re-used for \nimmediately successive stimuli than to be swapped (0.7 vs 0.3, respectively, compared with \n0.5 vs 0.5, respectively, in Experiment 2). In this way, the revised sequencing created a \nsituation in which participants would benefit overall by holding the most recent font-specific \ntranslation rules in working memory for re-implementation with the next stimulus. If the \neffect of font-switching in Experiment 2 was restricted to the 0.1 s ISI condition because the \nsequencing provided no incentive for participants to preserve the translation rules for re-\nimplementation across successive trials, then the revised sequencing in Experiment 3 would \nbe expected to induce an effect of font-switching regardless of ISI. After completing the \nexperiment, each participant was questioned to reveal the extent to which they were aware of \n  Font Tuning 26 \nthe sequencing constraints involving typeface (i.e., that after each change in typeface, the \nsame typeface would be used for the next few trials).  \nParticipants \n Nineteen female and eight male undergraduate students completed the experiment. \nTheir ages ranged from 18 to 42 years, and English was their first language. Twelve \nparticipants were assigned, at random, to the 0.1 s ISI condition, and fifteen participants were \nassigned to the 0.75 s ISI condition. \n________________ \nTable 4 about here \n________________ \nResults \n None of the participants revealed any awareness of the constraints in the sequencing \nof test stimuli. They all believed the sequencing, including the choice of typeface for each \nstimulus, to be entirely random across successive trials. \n The overall error rate was 4.1%, and the average correct RT was 712 ms.  \nReaction time \n There was a significant main effect of lexical category, F (1, 25) = 40.89, MSE = \n74.0, \u03b7p2 = .62, p < .001, with participants responding more quickly to words than to \npseudowords (M = 653 and 771 ms, respectively). There was also a significant main effect of \ntypeface transition, F (1, 25) = 24.97, MSE = 3.1, \u03b7p2 = .50, p < .001, with participants \nresponding more quickly when the current word\/pseudoword appeared in the same typeface \nas the immediately preceding word\/pseudoword, than when it appeared in a different typeface \n(M = 705 and 720, respectively) (cf. Table 4). Typeface transition did not interact \nsignificantly with ISI, or  lexical category, F < 1 in both cases. The facilitation due to \ntypeface correspondence measured 19 and 17 ms for words and pseudowords, respectively. \n  Font Tuning 27 \nAccuracy \n The main effect of typeface transition failed to achieve significance, F (1, 25) = 3.03, \nMSE = .23, \u03b7p2 = .12, p = .09, and on this occasion there was an overall tendency for \nparticipants to respond less accurately when the preceding word\/pseudoword appeared in the \nsame typeface as the current word\/pseudoword (M = 95.5 and 96.6%, respectively). The \neffect of typeface transition did not interact significantly with ISI, F < 1. \n Typeface transition, ISI, and Experiment. The strength of the typeface transition effect \non RT was compared across Experiments 2 and 3, separately for each value of ISI. Though \nthere was no difference in the strength of the effect across the two experiments at 0.1 s ISI, F \n= 0, there was a significant difference at 0.75 s ISI, F (1, 24) = 6.07, MSE = 10.0, \u03b7p2 = .20, p \n= .02.   \n Serial position. A different way of revealing the impact of introducing regular runs of \n3 or 4 stimuli in the same typeface is to examine the mean correct RT at each serial position \nwithin a run. The mean correct RTs for serial positions 1 to 4 were 720, 701, 705, and 709 \nms, respectively. Serial position 1 relates to trials that were preceded by a different typeface. \nThe fact that the mean RT for this serial position is relatively slow confirms the effect of \nfont-switching. ANOVA confirmed the significance of the main effect of serial position, F \n(3, 75) = 4.35, MSE = 3.4, \u03b7p2 = .15, p = .007, and the significance of the contrast between \nserial position 1 and serial position 2, F (1, 25) = 18.85, MSE = 9.1, \u03b7p2 = .43, p < .001. With \nregard to serial positions 2 to 4, ANOVA failed to reveal a significant effect of serial \nposition, F < 1. The results were next partitioned according to whether a run was preceded by \na run of just 3 trials involving a single typeface, or a run of 4 such trials (cf. Figure 8). In the \nlatter case, the constraints on the sequencing guaranteed that at serial position 1 the typeface \nwould differ from the preceding trial, whereas in the former case the typeface was equally \n  Font Tuning 28 \nlikely to be the same or different. The main effect of the length of the preceding run was not \nsignificant, F < 1. However, there was a significant interaction between the length of the \npreceding run and serial position, F (3, 75) = 7.96, MSE = 7.9, \u03b7p2 = .24, p < .001. Whereas \nthere was no effect of serial position after a preceding run of length 4, F < 1, there was a \nsignificant effect of serial position after a preceding run of length 3, F (3, 75) = 13.87, MSE = \n10.6, \u03b7p2 = .3, p < .001. Inspection of Figure 8 makes clear that this effect of serial position \narose from the relatively slow RTs at serial position 1. Indeed, RTs across serial positions 2 \nto 4 did not differ significantly, F (2, 50) = 1.92, MSE = 17, \u03b7p2 = .07, p = .16. Finally, \nanalysis of accuracy failed to find a significant main effect of either serial position or the \nlength of the preceding run, F < 1 in both cases. Though the interaction between these two \nfactors was significant, F (3, 75) = 11.50, MSE = 0.17, \u03b7p2 = .31, p < .001, inspection of the \nresults in Figure 8 confirms that this involved the later serial positions only (i.e., they \nappeared within runs of trials involving the same typeface). \nDiscussion \n The results confirm that readers have some control over the retention of font-specific \ntranslation rules for re-implementation across successive portions of text. The constraints \nimposed on the stimulus sequencing in this experiment (i.e., the same typeface was used for \nruns of 3 or 4 successive stimuli) provided additional incentive for participants to retain the \ntranslation rules currently in working memory for use with the next stimulus. Specifically, the \noverall probability with which successive stimuli appeared in the same typeface, rather than \nin alternative typefaces, was increased from 0.5 (Experiment 2) to 0.7 (Experiment 3). This \nresulted in an effect of font-switching surviving the longer ISI of 0.75 s. It seems, therefore, \nthat when it appears useful to do so, readers can retain the current font-specific translation \nrules in working memory for at least 0.75 s.  \n  Font Tuning 29 \n Initial predictions regarding how the constrained sequencing would moderate the \neffects of font-switching focussed on overall levels of performance, and how these might \ndiffer according to whether an immediately preceding stimulus appeared in the same typeface \nas the current stimulus, or in the alternative typeface. Because of the particular constraints \nthat were introduced, however, it was possible to assess participants\u2019 sensitivity to item-by-\nitem fluctuations in the utility of re-implementing the same font-specific translation rules \nacross successive stimuli. This assessment involved taking account of the serial position of \neach item within a run of trials involving the same typeface (i.e. within runs of 3 and 4 \nstimuli). Whereas serial position 1 related to occasions where the current and immediately \npreceding stimulus appeared in different typefaces, all other serial positions related to \noccasions where these stimuli appeared in the same typeface. Contrasting performance at \nserial position 1 against performance at all other serial positions confirmed the deleterious \neffect of font-switching. Crucially, however, this effect emerged only when the switch was \npreceded by a run of just three same-typeface trials, it did not emerge when the switch was \npreceded by a run of four same-typeface trials. The effect of the length of the immediately \npreceding run on responses at serial position 1 confirmed that participants were sensitive to \ntwo consequences of the sequencing constraints. First, that after the third item in a run, the \nprobability that the same typeface would be repeated dropped from 1.0 to 0.5 (i.e., each \ntypeface became equally likely to be used). And second, that the typeface would always \nchange after the fourth item in a run.  \n Following the third item in a run, the probability that the next item would appear in \nthe same typeface (i.e., .5) was the same probability that applied following every item in \nExperiment 2. The fact that only in the present experiment did font-switching have a \nsignificant effect at the longer ISI, confirms that participants did not respond solely on the \n  Font Tuning 30 \nbasis of the specific probability value associated with each serial position. They were also \nsensitive to the overall probability with which successive items appeared in the same \ntypeface.  \n Following the fourth item in a run, the next item always appeared in the alternative \ntypeface. Despite the switch in typeface, performance was not impeded relative to \nperformance on subsequent items in the run, suggesting that participants placed the \nappropriate translation rules in working memory in anticipation of the upcoming item. Had \nthey waited until the item appeared before accommodating the change in typeface, some \nslowing of the responses would have been expected, embracing the time needed to retrieve \nthe appropriate translation rules from long-term memory.  \n The serial position effect following a run of three same-typeface trials confirmed two \nadditional things. First, because the impact of font-switching was confined to serial position \n1, it does seem that only one set of translation rules is held in working memory. When the \nrules are removed from working memory, they lose any special status relative to all other sets \nof rules preserved in long-term memory, with the effect that the impact of font-switching is \nconfined to 1-back transitions. Second, by isolating the specific conditions under which \ntypeface switching will impact on performance, the level of impact was confirmed to be more \npronounced than had hitherto appeared. Thus, before serial position and the length of the \npreceding run of same-typeface trials were taken into account, font-switching appeared to add \napproximately 16 ms to response times (cf. Table 4). However, it now appears to add at least \n45 ms to response times (see Figure 8).  \nGeneral Discussion \n Evidence was reviewed in the first section of the present paper to support the concept \nof font tuning, that is, the derivation and implementation of font-specific rules mapping \n  Font Tuning 31 \nvisual features onto letters\u2019 structural descriptions. Structural descriptions are seen as a major \nbasis for accessing abstract letter identities, which in turn are seen as an important means of \naccessing the orthographic codes linked to lexical information (e.g., Miozzo & Caramazza, \n1998; Rapp, Folk, & Tainturier, 2001). This route to word identification was contrasted with \nan alternative route in which the 2D visual patterns (images) created by letters and letter \nstrings are matched to patterns in long-term memory, that in turn are linked to the \northographic codes associated with lexical information. The different conditions under which \nthese two routes to word identification might be expected to yield font-repetition effects were \nexplored. \n In a series of three experiments, the time course of font tuning was examined, \nespecially its sensitivity to the potential utililty of retaining translation rules across successive \nportions of text. Factors that were explored included the overall probability with which \nsuccessive portions of text appear in the same typeface, and the item-by-item fluctuations in \nthis probability. By increasing the overall probability from .5 to .7, the font-repetition effect \nsurvived an ISI of 0.75 s. Thus, participants seem to have some control over the time course \nof font tuning, and the increase in the probability of font-repetition seemed to provide them \nwith extra incentive to retain translation rules for re-implementation with successive portions \nof text. Without this extra incentive, retention for re-implementation was restricted to the \nshorter ISI of 0.1 s. \n The analysis of serial position effects in Experiment 3 provided more detailed \ninformation about font tuning. For example, the absence of any performance cost arising \nfrom a switch in typeface when this was certain to occur (i.e., after the fourth item in a run of \nsame-typeface trials), confirmed participants\u2019 sensitivity to item-by-item fluctuations in the \nprobability of font repetition. In addition, it confirmed that participants were able to prepare \n  Font Tuning 32 \nin advance for the new typeface, and did not have to wait until the new text appeared before \naccommodating the change. It is proposed that this preparation involved retrieving the \ntranslation rules appropriate for the impending typeface from long-term memory, and making \nthem available in working memory for implementation. In this way, participants were as well \nprepared for the next portion of text as they were within a run of same-typeface trials, when \nthe upcoming text was sure to appear in the same typeface as the immediately preceding text. \nOf course, it was only because there were just two alternative typefaces being mixed in the \npresent experiments that participants were able to prepare in this way for text that was to \nappear in a different typeface.  \n When only two typefaces are mixed in a sequence of stimuli, it is difficult to \ndissociate the impact of knowing that the same typeface will not be re-used (so that, for \nexample, its translation rules could be removed from working memory), from the impact of \nknowing which particular typeface this will be. If the account offered here is correct, \nregarding how participants prepared for an inevitable change in typeface, then font-switching \nshould induce performance costs in circumstances in which participants know that a different \ntypeface will be used, but do not know which typeface this will be. In these circumstances, \nparticipants have no option but to wait until the next portion of text appears to fully \naccommodate the change in typeface. It would be interesting, therefore, to extend the present \nstudy to embrace situations in which several typefaces are mixed, and in which sequencing \nconstraints ensure that the typeface will change after every nth item in a run, but with every \nother typeface then being equally likely to be used. The only preparation that could be \ninitiated by participants ahead of the new item would involve the removal of the translation \nrules currently in working memory.  \n  Font Tuning 33 \n The analysis of serial position in Experiment 3 also confirmed that the effects of font-\nswitching were confined to immediately successive stimuli. This was predicted from the \nproposal that only one set of font-specific translation rules can be accommodated in working \nmemory. When a set of rules is removed from working memory, their status becomes no \ndifferent from the status of other translation rules in long-term memory, and this explains \nwhy the effects of font-switching are confined to 1-back transitions. \n Though the present proposals concerning font tuning make reference to working \nmemory for the temporary retention of font-specific translation rules, the nature of this \nresource has not been elaborated (except for reference to its capacity to hold only one set of \ntranslation rules). On the one hand, the memory concerned could be a dedicated resource, the \nsole purpose of which is to allow a set of font-specific translation rules to be made available \nfor implementation. On the other hand, it could reflect a specific way of utilising a more \ngeneral resource. To address this issue, the present studies could be extended to embrace \ndual-task analysis. What types of concurrent tasks, and what types of associated stimuli \npresented in each ISI, would not interfere with the font-repetition effect? For example, if \nrequiring participants to encode and remember any visual stimulus in each ISI was found to \nremove the repetition effect, then the working memory supporting the temporary retention of \nfont-specific translation rules would begin to look like a general resource. Alternatively, if \nthe only concurrent tasks to interfere with the font-repetition effect are those requiring \nparticipants to deal with text in a different typeface, then this working memory would begin \nto look like a resource dedicated to dealing with text. \n Participants\u2019 sensitivity to the overall probability with which successive items appear \nin the same typeface, rather than in alternative typefaces, and to the item-by-item fluctuations \nin this probability, contrasts with their apparent lack of awareness of the sequencing \n  Font Tuning 34 \nconstraints put in place. All participants believed the sequencing, including the typefaces \nselected for successive stimuli, was completely random. It would seem, therefore, that \nvariability in the time course of font tuning need not reflect conscious decision processes on \nthe part of the reader, but can be an unconscious consequence of their implicit knowledge of \nthe sequencing constraints currently in place. This result deserves to be confirmed and \ninvestigated further. It would be useful to have converging evidence that participants\u2019 \nknowledge of the sequencing constraints is implicit. One possibility would be to change the \nconstraints in various ways after they have been learned, and to examine both the extent to \nwhich participants are aware of the change, and the way in which performance is disrupted \nby the change. Identifying which changes are disruptive, and which are not, would help to \nconfirm what has been learned implicitly about the original constraints. Participants\u2019 implicit \nknowledge of the sequencing constraints could also be assessed by presenting them with two \npossible runs of new stimuli, with one run conforming to the constraints present in the \nexperiment, and the other run deviating from these constraints. They could be asked to \nindicate which run seems to be the most pleasant. Implicit knowledge of the sequencing \nconstraints might be expected to increase participants\u2019 liking for runs that conform to the \nsequencing constraints present in the experiment trials (see, for example, Kunst-Wilson & \nZajonc, 1980; Seamon, Brody, & Kauff, 1983; Bornstein & D\u2019Agostino, 1992).  \n In all three experiments, the font-switching effect was insensitive to the lexical status \nof the current test item (i.e., by whether it was a word or pseudoword). Such insensitivity \nwould normally be taken as evidence for the pre-lexical locus of an effect and, in the present \ncontext, this is consistent with a role for font tuning in initial letter identification. A potential \nrole for the lexical guidance of font tuning is not to be denied, however. For example, Norris, \nButterfield, McQueen, and Cutler (2006) assembled mixed lists of words and nonwords in \n  Font Tuning 35 \nwhich one particular letter of the alphabet was always replaced by an ambiguous letter form. \nThis letter form was created by morphing the feature distinguishing the uppercase versions of \nthe letters H and N (i.e., the stroke connecting the two vertical strokes) until it was at the \nmidpoint on the H-N continuum. In the context of the lexical decision task, Norris et al. gave \nreaders experience with words and nonwords in which either the letter H, or the letter N, was \nalways replaced by the ambiguous letter form. It was observed that identification of the \nwords containing this letter form facilitated participants\u2019 re-calibration of the H-N dimension. \nFor example, after encountering text in which the letter form replaced the letter H, \nparticipants shifted the categorical boundary between H and N, towards the N end of the H-N \ncontinuum, so that forms in the midrange of this continuum would be categorised as an H. \nThough it is unclear if this re-calibration involved changing the font-specific translation rules \nand\/or the stored structural description for the substituted letter, these results encourage \nexploration of the potential for lexical guidance in the acquisition of font-specific translation \nrules. \n The concept of font tuning being promoted here embraces the assumption that, \nregardless of the typeface in which a particular case version of a letter appears, the same \nstructural description will be derived and accessed in long-term memory. In an investigation \nof visual memory for letter-color conjunctions, Walker and Hinkley (2003) provide evidence \nthat it is a record of the structural description for a letter, rather than a record of the font-\nspecific visual pattern it created, that is linked to a memory representation of the color in \nwhich the letter appeared. Their investigation extended previous work on memory for visual \nfeature conjunctions, some of which had examined shape-color associations using geometric \nshapes rather than letters. The theoretical context in which Walker and Hinkley situate their \nwork deliberately blurs the distinction between letters and visual objects. Instead, they \n  Font Tuning 36 \nsuggest that letters can be encoded as if they were pictures of objects. They point out that the \nstructural descriptions derived for letters could be equivalent to those derived for objects \n(e.g., the geon structural descriptions proposed by Biederman, 1987, with letter strokes \nserving as geons). Examples were presented in the review section of the present paper of \ntypefaces which depict letters as 3D forms, and in everyday life we encounter signage \nincorporating objects doubling up as letters. Indeed, the parallel between these two categories \nof visual stimuli can be extended by suggesting that the font-specific 2D visual patterns \ncreated by letters are the equivalent of the viewpoint-specific images of individual objects \nproposed by Tarr (e.g., Tarr, 1995). Perhaps, therefore, letter\/word and object identification \nare both supported by equivalent pattern-based and structure-based visual encoding \nprocesses.  \n Viewpoint-specific object images preserved in long-term memory can be networked \nto represent object categories (see, for example, Tarr & Gauthier, 1998). Initially, viewpoint-\nspecific images pertaining to the same individual object (e.g., my chair) would be networked, \nand this network would then represent the individual object in an effectively viewpoint-\nindependent manner (provided the object had been encountered from a sufficiently \ncomprehensive range of viewpoints). Next, all of the object-specific networks pertaining to \nobjects from the same category (e.g., all the networks for all chairs I have encountered) could \nthemselves be networked, to create a supernetwork representing the object category. If this \nprinciple of establishing category representations by the layered networking of images is \nextended to letters, some interesting possibilities arise regarding different types of category \nthat could be represented. For example, if all the images pertaining to a case-specific letter of \nthe alphabet, regardless of typeface, were to be pooled, the emerging network would \nrepresent the same concept as a structural description. Similarly, if all the images pertaining \n  Font Tuning 37 \nto a particular typeface, regardless of letter and case, were to be pooled, the emerging \nnetwork would represent all possible outcomes from the implementation of a set of font-\nspecific translation rules.  \n The existence of such category representations, based on pooling images of letters, \ncould provide an alternative explanation for some of the observations attributed to font \ntuning. For example, instead of a set of font-specific translation rules being retrieved from \nlong-term memory for implementation with a new portion of text, the reader could take steps \nto make the pool of images representing the typeface more accessible, thereby facilitating the \nsearch for an image that matches current input. The benefits associated with font-repetition \nwould then reflect the continuing heightened accessibility of the relevant pool of images, and \nthe costs associated with font-switching would reflect the demands associated with making a \ndifferent pool more accessible. Given that the creation of Tarr-like images is dependent on \nencountering individual objects from specific viewpoints, we see again the theoretical \nsignificance of utilising novel typefaces in studies of font tuning, and of assessing the extent \nto which experience with a subset of letters in a novel typeface generalises to letters that have \nyet to be seen in that typeface. Future studies of the time course of font tuning, and of its \nstrategic control, will benefit from incorporating novel typefaces, and from exploring how \nparticipants\u2019 experience with a subset of letters in a novel typeface generalises to other \nletters, and especially to letters that are visually dissimilar to those that have been seen.  \n________________ \nFigure 9 about here \n________________ \n Returning to the issue of the extent to which letters and pictures of objects are \nencoded in fundamentally similar ways, it is of interest to contemplate the object equivalent \nof a typeface, and to rehearse how evidence might be obtained for the object equivalent of \n  Font Tuning 38 \nfont tuning. For this purpose, we need to locate sets of artefacts, from the same superordinate \ncategory, that have distinctive, yet coherent, designs.  Candidate categories include furniture, \njewellery, and tableware. Figure 9 illustrates a knife, fork, and spoon manufactured by David \nMellor Design of Sheffield, England, according to two different designs, City and Chinese \nBlack (cf. davidmellordesign.com). As with letters and typefaces, each item has the essential \ncategory-defining structure (in this case determined by the object\u2019s intended function), but in \ndifferent designs this is realised in different ways that are consistent across all items in a set. \nFor example, the handles within a design have consistent features embracing shape, color, \nand other details (e.g., whether pins securing the handles are visible). The equivalent of font \ntuning would be in evidence if experience with a subset of items from a design allowed a \nperson to appreciate the themes inherent in the design. The equivalent of a font-repetition \neffect would occur if, as a result of such experience, new exemplars from a set were \nidentified more easily when they appeared in the same design, than when they appeared in a \ndifferent design. The equivalent of font-mixing would occur if people were to find it more \ndifficult to identify an item within a group of other exemplars from the same category (e.g., \nthe knife in Figure 10) when these exemplars were realised in a different design (Figure 10a), \nthan when they were realised in the same design (Figure 10b). Extending studies of font \ntuning to embrace the domain of artefacts, though very significant theoretically, would be \nrelatively straightforward.  \n________________ \nFigure 10 about here \n________________ \n  Font Tuning 39 \nReferences \nBiederman, I.

As a result, words \ncan be identified directly from their surface form, provided they have been seen in the same, \nor similar, surface form in a previous reading episode.  \n Studies designed to demonstrate that reading fluency can be enhanced as a result of \nhaving previously encountered text in the same visual format have often adopted an \nexperimental paradigm in which text is presented in two phases. In the first phase, \nparticipants are presented with text in one of a number of visual formats. In the second phase, \nthe same or related text is presented either in the same format as previously, or in one of the \nalternative formats. When reading fluency is enhanced to a greater extent when text reappears \nin the same format, it is concluded that aspects of the original text were preserved in memory \nin a format-specific manner. Determining whether and how this enhancement generalises to \nelements of text not included in the study phase (i.e., to other individual letters and multi-\nletter stings), helps identify which types of element are having their visual patterns preserved \nin memory. \n Familiar typefaces. When text appears in a familiar typeface, the visual patterns \ncreated by the letters and multi-letter strings it contains will have been encountered before. \nTherefore, corresponding patterns will already be available in long-term visual memory to \nsupport reading. Because of this, giving readers additional experience with the typeface in the \nfirst phase of a study is unlikely to add new records to visual memory and is, therefore, \n  Font Tuning 45 \nunlikely to enhance reading fluency when text in the same typeface is encountered in the \nsecond phase. In general, therefore, font-specific facilitation of reading through repetition is \nnot expected to occur with familiar typefaces. However, there are two factors that might \ncreate conditions in which reading fluency is enhanced through repetition when a familiar \ntypeface is involved. These factors concern the familiarity of the patterns created by multi-\nletter strings. They do not concern the patterns created by individual letters because these will \nalways be familiar. The first factor is word frequency. Though readers will have read \nuncommon words in familiar typefaces before, they will, by definition, have encountered \nthem infrequently. The second factor is the frequency of the multi-letter sequences (e.g., their \nsummed n-gram frequency). Though readers rarely encounter non-words, in any typeface, \nthey are likely to have encountered the multi-letter sequences they contain, especially where \nthe non-words are pseudowords rather than random sequences of letters, because the former \ninevitably involve familiar letter sequences. Putting these two factors together, therefore, \nsuggests that the font-specific facilitation of reading through repetition, though not normally \nexpected when text appears in a familiar typeface, might be expected in the case of infrequent \nwords (compared with frequent words), pseudowords (compared with words), and random \nletters strings (compared with pseudowords). Furthermore, because some letters of the \nalphabet normally create a different visual pattern in their uppercase and lowercase form, any \nfactors encouraging font-specific repetition effects on reading fluency would also be expected \nto encourage case-specific effects. Several studies provide support for all of these suggestions \n(Bowers, 1996; Burgund & Marsolek, 1997; Jacoby & Hayman, 1987; Kirsner, 1973).  \n Unfamiliar typefaces.  When text appears in an unfamiliar typeface, the visual patterns \ncreated by the letters and multi-letter strings are unlikely to have been encountered before, \nand so records of the patterns are unlikely to be available in long-term visual memory to \n  Font Tuning 46 \nsupport reading. By giving participants some experience reading text in an unfamiliar \ntypeface, such records will be added to long-term visual memory, thereby enhancing reading \nfluency when text in the same typeface is encountered later. In other words, a pattern-based \naccount of word identification can accommodate the font-specific facilitation of reading \nthrough repetition when unfamiliar typefaces are involved (and the category of unfamiliar \ntypefaces might be assumed to include handwriting and text that has been spatially \ntransformed, such as when all the individual lines of text are inverted). As in the case of \nfamiliar typefaces, facilitation through repetition would be expected to be more pronounced \nin the case of infrequent words, pseudowords, and random letter strings, and to be \naccompanied by case-specific effects. Several studies provide evidence in line with all of \nthese expectations (Brooks, 1977; Brown & Carr, 1993; Horton & McKenzie, 1995; \nKinoshita & Wayland, 1993; Kolers, 1979; Masson, 1986;  Roediger & Blaxton, 1987; \nVaidya et al., 1998). Indeed, Brooks, Masson, and Roediger and Blaxton present evidence \nconfirming that whole words can qualify as multi-letter strings having their visual patterns \npreserved in long-term visual memory.  \n Brooks (1977) asked participants to read through lists of 16 words as quickly as \npossible, making a note of how many names of people and places each list contained. Some \nlists were presented entirely in uppercase, others were presented with successive letters \nalternating in case. Sufficient practice on these was given to ensure that participants became \nequally fluent (quick) with either format. In a second phase, word lists were again presented, \nand these included words that had originally appeared in alternating case. Some of these \nwords reappeared in the same pattern of alternating case (e.g., lInDa \u2013 lInDa), others in the \ncomplementary case pattern (e.g., lInDa \u2013 LiNdA). Brooks observed reading fluency to be \nenhanced when words reappeared in the same pattern of alternating case. Because there were \n  Font Tuning 47 \nno constraints on the case in which individual letters and multi-letter sequences appeared in \nthe first phase of the study, this result was interpreted as evidence for the preservation of \nvisual patterns created by whole words. \n In a carefully designed study, Masson (1986) confirmed that the visual patterns \ncreated by whole words can be preserved in memory and can enhance reading fluency. In one \nexperiment (Experiment 3), he arranged for all the letters to be inverted, and for successive \nletters of each word to appear in alternating case, with the case of a word\u2019s initial letter being \ndetermined on a random basis. With these constraints on format, Masson ensured that each \nletter of the alphabet, and each sub-lexical letter sequence, appeared equally often in each \ncase, whereas whole words appeared in only one of the two possible case versions. In the first \nphase of his study, he gave participants practice at reading word triplets presented in this \nunusual format. In the second phase, participants re-read the same words, again with the \nletters inverted. Half of the words were presented in the same case pattern in which they had \nbeen seen in the first phase, half were presented in the alternative case pattern. Masson \nobserved reading in the second phase to be enhanced when the words were re-presented in \nthe same case pattern, rather than in the complementary case pattern. In a replication of \nMasson\u2019s experiment, Horton and McKenzie (1995) used both a familiar and an unfamiliar \ntypeface, and observed a combined word- and case-specific facilitation effect only with the \nunfamiliar typeface. \n To conclude, in line with more recent studies of the effects of case mixing on reading \n(cf. the Introduction), evidence exists for format-specific repetition effects involving both \nfamiliar and unfamiliar formats, including familiar and unfamiliar typefaces. This evidence \nreveals a number of factors determining when pattern-based font-repetition effects are to be \n  Font Tuning 48 \nexpected. These factors, which include word and n-gram frequency, reflect a reader\u2019s \nunfamiliarity with the visual patterns created by multi-letter strings.  \n  Font Tuning 49 \n   \nAuthor Note \n Peter Walker, Department of Psychology, Lancaster University, UK \n I thank Rachel Osbaldeston for gathering some of the data reported here, and Simon \nSlavin for creating the experiment generator software. \n Correspondence concerning this article should be addressed to Peter Walker, Department \nof Psychology, Lancaster University, Lancaster LA1 4YF, UK.  \n e-mail: p.walker@lancaster.ac.uk.  \n tel: +44 (0) 1524 593163 \n fax: +44 (0) 1524 593744 \n \n  Font Tuning 50 \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable 1 \nExperiment 1: Mean correct RT and mean percentage error rate (in italics) according \nto the spatial location of the current word\/pseudoword, and the spatial location of the \nimmediately preceding word\/pseudoword. \n____________________________________________________________________ \n               Location of preceding word\/pseudoword \n         Upper       Lower \n             __________________________________ \nLocation of current word\/pseudoword \n Upper      927    6.4     984    8.4  \n Lower      990    8.5   1008    7.7 \n____________________________________________________________________ \n \n \n \n  Font Tuning 51 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable 2 \nExperiment 1: Mean correct RT and mean percentage error rate (in italics) \naccording to whether the word\/pseudoword appeared in the same typeface as the \nconsonant string, or in a different typeface, and according to the lexical category of \nthe test stimulus. \n___________________________________________________________________ \n           Lexical category \n           Word     Pseudoword \n      _______________________________ \nTypeface correspondence between \nword\/pseudoword and consonant string \n Same typeface      870    4.6    1067   11.9  \n Different typeface     901    5.1    1094     9.6 \n___________________________________________________________________ \n \n  Font Tuning 52 \n \n \nTable 3 \nExperiment 2: Mean correct RT and mean percentage error rate (in italics) according \nto typeface transition, ISI, and lexical category transition. \n____________________________________________________________________ \nA                     ISI \n      ________________________________ \n            0.1 s       0.75 s \n      ________________________________ \nTypeface transition \n Same typeface          661    4.3  688    5.4 \n Different typeface         678    4.0  684    4.3 \n____________________________________________________________________ \nB               Lexical category transition \n      ________________________________ \n                 Same category         Different category \n      ________________________________ \nTypeface transition \n Same typeface    660    4.8  689    5.0 \n Different typeface   683    4.7  679    3.6 \n____________________________________________________________________ \n \n  Font Tuning 53 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable 4 \nExperiment 3: Mean correct RT and mean percentage error rate (in italics) according \nto typeface transition and ISI. \n____________________________________________________________________ \n                     ISI \n      ________________________________ \n           0.1 s      0.75 s \n      ________________________________ \nTypeface transition \n Same typeface          691    5.0  719    3.9 \n Different typeface         708    4.7  733    2.9 \n____________________________________________________________________ \n \n  Font Tuning 54 \nFigure Legends \nFigure 1.
