Most studies have analyzed\npopulations of European descent where low diversity at the mini-\nsatellite combined with strong linkage disequilibrium in flanking\nregions make it difficult to distinguish between etiological and\nassociated variants (Bennett and Todd 1996; Doria et al. 1996).\nThe identification of etiological polymorphisms in the insulin\nregion may therefore require analysis of a range of different\npopulations, in particular those showing a greater range of hap-\nlotype diversity than that seen in Europeans.\nAs a first step in these studies, we used a system of minisat-\nellite variant repeat mapping by PCR (MVR-PCR; Jeffreys et al.\n1991) to analyze variation at the insulin minisatellite both in\nallele size (number of tandem repeats) and structure (distribution\nof different variant repeats) in a range of populations from Africa,\nAsia, and Europe (Stead and Jeffreys 2000, 2002). Pairwise com-\nparisons between all alleles showed that structures were either\nvery different from each other, indicating that they had diverged\nthrough multiple complex mutational rearrangements, or dis-\nplayed very similar patterns of variant repeat distribution, result-\ning in these closely related structures having similar overall sizes.\nIn this way, alleles could be readily divided into lineage groups\nwith low levels of variation within each lineage both in allele size\nand structure (Stead and Jeffreys 2000, 2002). Analysis of three\nAfrican populations from the Ivory Coast (156 alleles), Zimbabwe\n(138), and Kenya (84) revealed substantial structural diversity\nwith minisatellite alleles assigned to one of 22 different lineages.\nIn contrast, all alleles within non-African populations from the\nU.K. (1080 alleles), Japan (118), and Kazakhstan (80) belong to\njust three lineages. These lineages, termed I, IIIA, and IIIB, are all\npresent in Africa. This reduction in diversity from 22 lineages in\nAfricans to a subset of just three lineages in non-Africans is con-\nsistent with a wealth of genetic evidence from mtDNA, Y chro-\nmosome polymorphisms, and autosomal markers which demon-\nstrates a greater diversity in Africans than non-Africans and sup-\nports an African origin for anatomically modern humans (for\nreview, see Tishkoff and Williams 2002). Although other expla-\nnations are possible, an African origin is further supported by the\npresence at multiple loci of ancestral sequences seen exclusively\nin Africa (Takahata et al. 2001).\nAlthough most studies of genetic variation have identified\ngreater diversity in Africans compared with non-Africans, the\ndifference in lineage frequencies at the insulin minisatellite be-\ntween these population groups is unusually large, with 28% of\nthe total genetic variance being due to differences between Afri-\ncans and non-Africans (Stead and Jeffreys 2002). This is substan-\ntially greater than that at most other loci (average 11%; Barbujani\net al. 1997). Although this increased population differentiation is\nconsistent with differential selection acting in the past between\nAfricans and non-Africans, it is unclear whether the differentia-\ntion is simply an artifact of using minisatellite lineages rather\nthan haplotypes defined by SNPs.\nWe now extend these minisatellite structural studies by ana-\nlyzing SNP variation flanking the minisatellite in the three Afri-\ncan and three non-African populations previously analyzed. If\nthe 22 minisatellite lineages are truly monophyletic and deeply\n3Corresponding author.\nE-MAIL jdstead@umich.edu; FAX (734) 647-4130.\n4Present address: Mental Health Research Institute, University of\nMichigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.\nArticle and publication are at http:\/\/www.genome.org\/cgi\/doi\/10.1101\/\ngr.948003.\nLetter\n13:2101\u20132111 \u00a92003 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press ISSN 1088-9051\/03 $5.00; www.genome.org Genome Research 2101\nwww.genome.org\n Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press on August 19, 2013 - Published by genome.cshlp.orgDownloaded from \ndiverged from each other, then the unusually great differentia-\ntion between Africans and non-Africans should be reflected by\nelevated haplotype differentiation. SNP-based haplotypes could\nalso give further clues about the nature, timing, and intensity of\nselective pressures in this region of DNA.\nHaplotype data are also highly relevant to disease-\nassociation studies. Lineage diversity is too great in Africans for\neach lineage to be tested independently for association, and the\nuse of MVR-PCR is too labor-intensive for lineage identification\nin large cohorts. Haplotype analysis should identify SNPs that\ncan act as surrogate markers for minisatellite lineages, allowing\nlineage identification in large cohorts. Furthermore, the identi-\nfication of closely related haplotypes will allow different but re-\nlated lineages to be pooled, thus providing a framework for a\nhierarchical cladistic approach to disease-association studies\n(Templeton et al. 2000).\nRESULTS\nGlobal SNP Diversity in the Insulin Gene Region\nPrevious analysis of variant repeat structures of 1278 non-African\nand 378 African alleles at the insulin minisatellite identified 22\nlineages in Africans, with a subset of just three lineages present in\nnon-Africans (Stead and Jeffreys 2000, 2002). We used this infor-\nmation to select three non-Africans and 13 Africans for SNP dis-\ncovery who between them contained 21 of these 22 lineages; this\nstrategy helped maximize the chance of detecting SNPs and gain-\ning a global view of DNA diversity. Analysis of a 7.8-kb region\nincluding the minisatellite identified 53 polymorphisms, with an\nadditional three polymorphisms determined from the literature\n(Table 1). To the best of our knowledge, only 22 of these 56 SNPs\nhave been described previously (Elbein et al. 1985; Kelsoe et al.\n1988; Julier et al. 1991; Lucassen et al. 1993; Owerbach and Gab-\nbay 1993; Johnson et al. 2001). Nucleotide diversity across the 32\nsequences was estimated as \u0001 = 0.00124. Although this estimate\nwill be biased upwards, as individuals were selected for sequenc-\ning based on maximal diversity at the minisatellite, similar esti-\nmates were derived from haplotype data (described below) on\nunselected chromosomes, which will be biased downwards be-\ncause only known variants were typed on most chromosomes\n(data not shown). These measures of the average difference per\nnucleotide between two randomly chosen sequences selected\nfrom a population are similar to estimates from elsewhere in the\ngenome (Jorde et al. 2001). The 56 polymorphisms include 40\ntransitions and 14 transversions, plus a 4-bp insertion and a 5-bp\ndeletion. Twenty-seven polymorphisms (48%) were at CpG dou-\nblets (24 transitions and three transversions), four were within 3\nbp of polymerase \u0002-arrest sites (TGRRGA), and three were within\nmononucleotide runs of \u00035 bp (Templeton et al. 2000). The\nhigher frequency of polymorphism at CpG doublets compared\nwith estimates from elsewhere in the genome (Templeton et al.\n2000) is perhaps unsurprising given the high GC content of the\nregion (65% GC excluding the minisatellite) and evidence of im-\nprinting in this region (Moore et al. 2001). Indeed, levels of poly-\nmorphism are known to increase with GC content, at least over\nshort genomic regions (Sachidanandam et al. 2001; Smith and\nLercher 2002).\nThe ancestral states of 49 of the 56 polymorphisms could be\ndetermined unambiguously by comparison with chimpanzee,\ngorilla, and orangutan sequences. The remaining seven ambigu-\nous sites showed evidence of recurrent mutation in primates,\nwith five occurring at CpG doublets. One CpG doublet was poly-\nmorphic in humans for both TpG and CpA variants (SNPs INS-66\nand INS-67) with the gorilla showing the likely ancestral CpG\nform, the orangutan the TpG form, and the chimpanzee the CpA\nform. The only amino acid substitutional changes among the\nfour species were within the signal peptide of preproinsulin, with\na conservative Ala\u2192Val switch at position \u000113 in chimpanzees\n(Seino et al. 1992) plus an Ala\/Gln\/Ser three-way substitution at\nposition \u00012 which is also polymorphic in humans, resulting in\nan Ala\u2192Thr substitution (Oda et al. 2001).\nSequence comparisons between humans and chimpanzees\ngenerated a sequence divergence estimate of 2.11%. By random\nconcatenation of human and chimpanzee sequence data from 53\nnoncoding autosomal loci described by Chen and Li (2001), we\ngenerated a distribution of divergences between these sequences.\nDivergence estimates as high as 2.11% were not observed in this\ndistribution, allowing us to show that sequence divergence at the\ninsulin region was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than at most\nother loci (see Methods). Furthermore, sequence comparisons\nwith other great apes revealed high divergence between all spe-\ncies analyzed (Supplemental Information Table S1, available on-\nline at www.genome.org; Chen and Li 2001). This elevated di-\nvergence may reflect the high GC content near the insulin gene\n(65%) and the abundance of segregating sites at CpG dinucleo-\ntides. A relative rates test performed on these sequence data\nshowed that the insulin gene region was evolving in a clock-like\nfashion (P > 0.05).\nGenotype and Haplotype Diversity\nTo determine the level of diversity around the insulin gene, we\ntyped all of the 56 polymorphisms in 189 non-Africans from the\nU.K. (102 individuals), Kazakhstan (28), and Japan (59), plus 189\nAfricans from the Ivory Coast (78 individuals), Zimbabwe (69),\nand Kenya (42). All of these individuals had been previously\ncharacterized for insulin minisatellite structures using MVR-PCR\n(Stead and Jeffreys 2002). Fifty-two of these SNPs were polymor-\nphic in Africans, compared with only 21 in non-Africans (Table 1).\nTo investigate haplotype diversity around the insulin gene,\nwe inferred haplotypes from diploid SNP data in silico using the\nPHASE algorithm (Table 2; Stephens et al. 2001). A total of 77\ndifferent haplotypes were identified (70 with >95% confidence).\nAfricans contained 66 of these haplotypes (61 with >95% confi-\ndence), compared to only 20 in Europeans and Asians (18 with\n>95% confidence). These differences in haplotype diversity\nprompted further investigations of population differentiation by\nFst and analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) analyses (Table\n3; data not shown). Both approaches revealed unusually high\ndifferentiation between Africans and non-Africans, compared to\nmodest differentiation between Europe and Asia and very little\ndifferentiation within Asia or between the three African popula-\ntions tested. This picture is very similar quantitatively to the\nlevels of population differentiation seen using minisatellite lin-\neage data (Table 3). This demonstrates that the unexpectedly\nlarge reduction in minisatellite lineage diversity seen in non-\nAfricans (Stead and Jeffreys 2002) is not an artifact of using data\nfrom groups of related minisatellite alleles but instead reflects a\ngenuine major shift in lineage frequencies not only at the mini-\nsatellite but also at flanking SNPs and haplotypes.\nAs noted previously (Stead and Jeffreys 2002), this extreme\npopulation differentiation between Africans and non-Africans is\nconsistent with differential and directional selection acting to\nincrease genetic differentiation between population groups (Cav-\nalli-Sforza et al. 1994), whereas the similar lineage composition\nin the three non-African populations suggests that selection\nacted on a population which was ancestral to all three. If selec-\ntion is acting at or near the minisatellite, then markers closest to\nthe minisatellite should show the highest levels of population\ndifferentiation, with recombination releasing more distal mark-\ners from these selective pressures and reducing the differentiation\nbetween populations. This prediction was tested using a sliding\nStead et al.\n2102 Genome Research\nwww.genome.org\n Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press on August 19, 2013 - Published by genome.cshlp.orgDownloaded from \nTable 1.

This analysis showed that the\ncomponent of variance attributed to differences between Afri-\ncans and non-Africans rose to a peak of 43.5% near the minisat-\nellite, far higher than the genome average of 10.8% (Barbujani et\nal. 1997) and fell to 4.2% towards the 5\u0002 end of IGF2. In contrast,\nneither the HKA test (Hudson et al. 1987; comparing the insulin\nregion with the LPL locus; Clark et al. 1998) nor estimates of\nTajima\u2019s D (\u00011.027; Tajima 1989) found evidence of selection at\nthe insulin locus (P > 0.05; data not shown). Although this ap-\npears to contradict the Fst estimates, the high Fst values reflect the\nvery low lineage and haplotype diversity in non-Africans, sug-\ngesting that selection may have occurred since the MRCA and\nspecifically in these populations. If so, then the HKA test, which\nwe used to compare human\/great ape sequence divergence with\nhuman sequence diversity, would have little power to detect this\nrecent selection. Similarly, the Tajima test, which compares\nnucleotide diversity with the number of segregating sites in hu-\nmans, would have little power to detect selection in our sequence\ndata set established primarily (81%) from Africans.\nPatterns of Linkage Disequilibrium\nD\u0002 is a measure of complete disequilibrium where |D\u0002| = 1 if at\nmost three of the four possible haplotypes are present (Lewontin\n1964).

High LD was observed in each of the three non-African\npopulations across the 7.8-kb region. The only exception is the 5\u0002\nmost distal SNP INS-1, though LD has been reported to extend\nover 6 kb 5\u0002 of this position (Doria et al. 1996), suggesting that\nLD breakdown at INS-1 may instead have resulted from recurrent\nmutation or localized gene conversion at this marker rather than\nfrom crossover. The main difference between the non-African\npopulations was reduced statistical power supporting LD in the\nJapanese, a consequence of 95% of chromosomes within this\npopulation belonging to lineage I.\nTo investigate haplotype structure, we analyzed levels of ab-\nsolute association in these populations using the LD measure \u0005\nfor which |\u0005| = 1 where at most only two of the possible four\nhaplotypes are present (Hill and Robertson 1968). Two blocks of\nabsolute association were apparent in non-Africans, indicating\nthe presence of only two major haplotypes per block (Table 2A).\nThese blocks of very low haplotype diversity, one covering the\nINS gene and 5\u0002 flanking region and the other extending over the\nfirst exon of the IGF2 gene, correlate strongly with the heavily\nreduced minisatellite lineage diversity seen in Europeans and\nAsians. Thus, the two main haplotypes in the INS block, which\ncorresponds to the region of disequilibrium previously described\nby Lucassen et al. (1993), are associated with minisatellite lin-\neages I and IIIA in all three non-African populations (Table 2A).\nSimilarly, one haplotype in the IGF2 block corresponds to sub-\nlineage IC, with the other haplotype being associated with ID\nand IIIA lineages. Haplotypes associated with lineage IIIB differ\nfrom the two main haplotypes in each block, but are at low\nfrequency in these populations and so do not dramatically re-\nduce levels of absolute association. We found no evidence of\nhistorical recombination between the two blocks of association.\nThe degree of LD in the insulin gene region is lower in Af-\nricans compared to non-Africans (Fig. 2). Patterns of complete\ndisequilibrium (D\u0002) do show evidence for possible LD blocks that\nbroadly correspond to the two domains of absolute disequilib-\nrium (\u0005) identified in non-Africans (Table 2B). Application of the\nfour-gamete test to these populations found evidence of recom-\nbination between the two blocks of disequilibrium. Furthermore,\nthere was evidence of homoplasy at four markers within the INS\nLD block (INS-21, INS-24, INS-69, and INS-28) which cluster in\nan interval from 50 bp 5\u0002 of the minisatellite to 800 bp 3\u0002 of the\nminisatellite (Fig. 2B, Table 2B). This clustering, plus the obser-\nvation that two of the four markers are not located at sites prone\nto increased mutation, argue against recurrent mutation and in-\nstead provide evidence of a minisatellite-associated increase in\nlocal recombination frequency. Interestingly there is little evi-\ndence that linkage phase has been disrupted between markers\ndistal to these apparent recombinants, suggesting that either\ncrossing-over occurred between similar haplotypes or that re-\ncombination may be generating conver-\nsions in this region. The lack of observ-\nable recombinants in this region in non-\nAfricans may simply reflect the fact that\nthese markers are monomorphic in Eu-\nropeans and Asians.\nHistorical recombination rates in\nthe insulin gene region were investi-\ngated by analyzing the rate of decay of\nabsolute disequilibrium with distance\n(Fig. 2C). LD decays more rapidly in Af-\nricans than non-Africans, with extended\nLD greatest in the Japanese population,\nfollowed by Kazakhstan, then the U.K.\nAssuming an effective population size of\n10,000 (Jorde et al. 1998), the decay of LD suggests a mean re-\ncombination activity of 5.3 cM\/Mb across the region (ranging\nfrom 0.4 to 12.8 cM\/Mb depending on the population consid-\nered), somewhat higher than the genome average rate of 1 cM\/\nMb (Yu et al. 2001). This is likely to be an overestimate given the\nevidence of gene conversion and recurrent mutation in this re-\ngion, both of which will contribute to LD decay. Assuming that\nthe recombination activity is the same in all populations, the LD\ndecay data suggest a ratio of effective population sizes among\nAfrica, Asia, and Europe of 10:1:3. This is similar to estimates of\n7:1:2 based on simple tandem repeat (STR) data (Relethford and\nJorde 1999) and 3:1:1 based on craniometric and genetic data sets\n(Relethford and Harpending 1994).\nPhylogenetic Network Analysis\nWe used median joining network analysis (Bandelt et al. 1999) of\nthe insulin haplotypes to explore the phylogenetic relationships\nbetween minisatellite lineages (Fig. 3A). To minimize reticulation\narising from historical recombination events, we focused on a\n3.6-kb region spanning the minisatellite, from markers INS-11 to\nINS-40, that is two SNPs (512 bp) shorter than the largest block of\ncomplete disequilibrium found in African populations. This\nanalysis revealed a star-like phylogeny in which the residual re-\nticulation involved only markers INS-21, INS-24, INS-69, and\nINS-28 near the minisatellite which had been previously identi-\nfied as being prone to recombination.\nMost nodes on the haplotype phylogeny contain only one\nminisatellite lineage, confirming that these lineages defined by\nrepeat DNA structure are genuinely monophyletic and that many\nof them are highly diverged, in particular lineages I and IIIA that\naccount for the majority of non-African chromosomes. Discount-\ning singletons, only three lineages shared the same flanking hap-\nlotype (lineages S\/V, lineages IIIB\/X, and lineage K with a subset\nof lineage J). Minisatellite alleles can therefore on occasion be-\ncome highly diverged in structure without accumulating flank-\ning mutations. Conversely, three lineages were spread over simi-\nlar haplotypes related by mutation (lineages IIIA and Y) or by\neither mutation or recombination (lineage J), indicating that ma-\njor rearrangements in the minisatellite must occur sufficiently\nrarely to allow flanking mutations to sometimes accumulate\nwithin a minisatellite lineage. It therefore follows that major re-\narrangements must occur at a rate similar to base substitution\nover this 3.6-kb region (c.7\u000410\u00015 per gamete). Interestingly, this\nrate is similar to the frequency of major complex rearrangements\nat the minisatellite detected in human sperm (c.2\u000410\u00015; Stead\nand Jeffreys 2000).\nTo investigate whether closely related haplotypes had mini-\nsatellite lineages of similar sizes, pairwise comparisons were per-\nformed between the most common haplotype from each of the\n22 lineages. There was no correlation between the distance be-\ntween haplotypes and the size difference between minisatellite\nTable 3.

This implies that major\nrearrangements occurring in the minisatellite must involve radi-\ncal changes in allele lengths, as seen in complex sperm mutants\n(Stead and Jeffreys 2000).\nComparison of human and primate sequences located the\nroot of the network at or near the central node of the star phy-\nlogeny (lineages S\/V or H, respectively). Haplotypes near the root\nwere uncommon in Africans and absent from non-Africans. Two\nof the three lineages found outside Africa (lineages I and IIIB) lie\non the same haplotypes in Africans and non-Africans (Fig. 3A,B).\nIn contrast, lineage IIIA alleles in Europeans and Asians have\ndiverged from their African counterparts by mutation at INS-11\nand\/or INS-40, suggesting diversification following the founding\nof non-African populations.\nDISCUSSION\nPrevious studies of lineage diversity at the insulin minisatellite\nrevealed an unusually high level of genetic differentiation be-\ntween Africans and non-Africans, considerably greater than that\nseen at most other genomic regions analyzed using SNPs or mi-\ncrosatellites (Barbujani et al. 1997; Jorde et al. 1998). We now\nshow that this hyperdifferentiation is not an artifact of using\nminisatellite lineages as markers, but instead correlates with a\nremarkable degree of population differentiation in SNP-based\nhaplotypes near the minisatellite. Furthermore, this differentia-\ntion does not appear to affect the whole insulin gene region\nuniformly; rather, it extends across a region previously impli-\ncated in susceptibility to type 1 diabetes (Lucassen et al. 1993),\nreaching a peak at and near the minisatellite. These data are\nconsistent with directional selection acting on the minisatellite\nor a nearby polymorphism, with more distal markers being re-\nleased from selective pressures by historical recombination. As\npreviously noted (Stead and Jeffreys 2002), the substantial over-\nrepresentation of lineage I chromosomes in Europeans and\nAsians raises the possibility that positive selection has acted to\nincrease the frequency of class I chromosomes specifically in\nnon-African populations, as a result for example of adaptation to\ndifferent environments. The finding of the same three lineages in\nall non-African populations suggests that this selection acted\nearly during the migration out of Africa, and that shared evolu-\ntionary history accounts for the similar lineage composition of\nthe three non-African populations. Finally, we found no evi-\ndence of differences in selective environments between Europe\nand Japan, as Fst values between these populations are no higher\nat the insulin locus than at other autosomal loci (Cavalli-Sforza et\nal. 1994). We are not aware of comparative data for Kazakhstan.\nIt will be of considerable interest to extend these analyses\nmore broadly in the INS region, to see whether other peaks of\npopulation hyperdifferentiation can be detected that may mark\nregions that have undergone prehistoric selection. If selective\nenvironments have remained sufficiently stable over time, such\nsites may colocate with regions containing variants underlying\ncurrent disease etiologies. These studies might also prove more\ninformative as to the nature of the putative selection that has\nacted on this locus. For example, analyses of extended haplo-\ntypes have recently been used to find signatures of recent selec-\ntion at two genes implicated in resistance to malaria, G6PD, and\nthe CD40 ligand (Sabeti et al. 2002). However, this approach may\nFigure 1 Differentiation between Africans and non-Africans across the insulin region. Components of genetic variance attributed to differences in\nhaplotype frequencies between African and non-African populations were determined by sliding-window AMOVA analysis (Excoffier et al. 1992) using\nthe program SWAPS (see Methods) from overlapping blocks of 16 SNPs across the insulin region.

Gray boxes are exons, black boxes introns, and the striped box is the minisatellite.\nStead et al.\n2106 Genome Research\nwww.genome.org\n Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press on August 19, 2013 - Published by genome.cshlp.orgDownloaded from \nnot be fruitful at the insulin locus, where selection is likely to be\nmuch older and therefore harder to detect; also, neutral \u2018core\nhaplotypes\u2019 at the same locus in the same populations are not\navailable for comparison.\nThere is substantial linkage disequilibrium across the insulin\ngene region, most noticeably in non-Africans but still present in\nAfrican populations; for example, 57% of comparisons between\nSNPs with minor allele frequencies >0.15 yielded D\u0002 values >0.9\nin the Ivory Coast sample. Despite these associations, there is\nevidence that historical recombination events have contributed\nto haplotype diversity. The indirectly estimated recombination\nactivity of this region is roughly fivefold higher than the mean\nrate of 1 cM\/Mb in the human genome (Yu et al. 2001). However,\nhistorical recombination events appear not to be randomly scat-\ntered but rather cluster into two regions, one between INS and\nIGF2, and another spanning a region from just upstream of the\ninsulin minisatellite to 800 bp 3\u0002 of the minisatellite. There is\ngrowing evidence that minisatellites are generated from errors in\nmeiotic recombination centered at recombination hotspots (Jef-\nfreys et al. 1998). It is therefore possible that the insulin mini-\nsatellite may also be associated with a weak hotspot perhaps 3\u0002 to\nthe minisatellite. Consistent with this, sperm mutation studies\nhave revealed a low frequency recombination-based mode of re-\npeat DNA instability in the germline, with some evidence that\nthese events occur preferentially towards the 3\u0002 end of the mini-\nsatellite (Stead and Jeffreys 2000).\nVariant repeat analysis at the insulin minisatellite identified\n22 lineages with highly diverged structures, most of which are\napparently present only in Africa (Stead and Jeffreys 2002). Net-\nwork analysis of haplotype data has now confirmed that most\nFigure 2 Linkage disequilibrium (LD) across 7.8 kb of the insulin gene region. (A) LD patterns in U.K. and Ivory Coast populations.

For example, lin-\neages IIIB, X, and Y all share a motif of consecutive F, A, C, and\nE variant repeats, whereas lineages L, M, and W display similari-\nties at both 5\u0002 and 3\u0002 ends. This indicates that motif sharing\nbetween lineages can be due to a relatively recent common an-\ncestry as opposed to recombination or mutational convergence.\nHowever, neither these motifs nor minisatellite allele lengths can\nserve as reliable phylogenetic markers for identifying related lin-\neages, and lineage phylogeny can only be established by analysis\nof flanking haplotypes.\nThese data provide a framework for\nfuture disease association studies at the\ninsulin region in a range of populations.\nMost previous studies analyzed popula-\ntions of European descent in which low\nminisatellite and haplotype diversity\ncombined with high LD near the mini-\nsatellite make it difficult to distinguish\netiological from associated variants\n(Bennett and Todd 1996; Stead et al.\n2000). Our data suggest that this limita-\ntion would apply to the analysis of any\nnon-African population, given that\nAsians and Europeans share the same\nfew lineages and associated haplotypes.\nHowever, increased lineage diversity and\nreduced LD in African populations open\nup the possibility of a second phase of\nhigher-resolution studies with the po-\ntential to be able to dissect out etiologi-\ncal variants which in non-African popu-\nlations cannot be uniquely identified\ndue to strong associations with other\nmarkers. The present study allowed us to\nidentify either lineage-specific SNPs or\ncombinations of SNPs for every known\nminisatellite lineage; these could be rap-\nidly analyzed as surrogate markers of\nminisatellite lineage in every population\n(Table 2, Suppl. Information S2). Fur-\nthermore, although many African lin-\neages are found at too low a frequency to\nallow their effects on disease susceptibil-\nity to be independently analyzed, our\nhaplotype phylogenetic analysis de-\nscribes relationships between different\nlineages, allowing different closely re-\nlated lineages to be combined into a\nsingle group of sufficient size for associa-\ntion analysis. This allows for a hierarchi-\ncal cladistic approach to association\nstudies in Africans in which analysis of a\nsmall number of SNPs will allow closely\nrelated lineages to be initially analyzed\nas a single group (Templeton et al. 2000).\nThe effects of specific lineages within in-\ndividual groups could then be further in-\nvestigated by analyzing additional poly-\nmorphisms.\nFinally, there is considerable inter-\nest in defining haplotype blocks in the\nhuman genome and identifying haplo-\ntype-tag (ht) SNPs that can be used to capture efficiently most or\nall of the haplotype information within a block (Johnson et al.\n2001; Gabriel et al. 2002). There is evidence that common hap-\nlotypes within a block can to some extent at least be global,\nshared by most or all major population groups, and raising the\npossibility of defining a set of universal ht-SNPs for an LD block\napplicable to any population (Gabriel et al. 2002). The present\ndata show that this approach may face substantial difficulties.\nFor example, the haplotypes carrying lineage IIIA alleles in non-\nAfricans (IIIAa,b) are absent from Africans, with allele INS-40T\nwhich uniquely identifies this lineage in Europeans and Asians\n(Table 2) being absent from Africans. Similarly, marker INS-74\nused elsewhere to define one of the most common haplotypes\nwithin the U.K. population (Johnson et al. 2001) was not detect-\nFigure 3 Median-joining (MJ) network analysis of the insulin gene region.

Briefly, struc-\ntures of all alleles within a lineage can be aligned to each other,\nwhereas different lineages cannot be aligned. Some lineages con-\ntained subgroups of alleles that were more similar to each other\nthan to other alleles within that lineage. These subgroups are\ntermed \u2018sublineages.\u2019 Our nomenclature incorporates terminol-\nogy used in previous publications (Bell et al. 1984; Stead and\nJeffreys 2000). Originally, minisatellite alleles were divided into\nthree classes on the basis of size: class I (small), II (intermediate),\nand III (large) (Bell et al. 1984; Rotwein et al. 1986). In Europeans,\nclass I alleles form a single lineage called lineage I, class II alleles\nare rare, and class III alleles divide into two lineages termed IIIA\nand IIIB (Stead and Jeffreys 2000). Other lineages are denoted\nwith capital letters, and sublineages are indicated by Roman nu-\nmerals; thus IIIAii is the second sublineage of lineage IIIA. The\nonly exceptions are sublineages IC, ID, and IE of lineage I, named\nprior to this study (Stead and Jeffreys 2000, 2002). The names of\nspecific minisatellite alleles reflect minisatellite lineage\/\nsublineage, allele size (number of repeats), and a further discrimi-\nnator; for example, allele ID42.4 is the fourth allele of 42 repeats\nidentified from the ID sublineage of lineage I.\nHaplotypes were inferred from combined SNP and minisat-\nellite lineage data and named according to minisatellite lineage,\nwith different haplotype variants indicated in lowercase letters;\nthus Wa andWb are the first and second haplotypes identified in\nchromosomes carrying the minisatellite from lineage W.\nSNP Discovery and Genotyping\nPCR primers designed from the genomic sequence of the insulin\nregion (accession number L15440; Lucassen et al. 1993) were\nused to amplify a 3.163-kb region 5\u0002 of the minisatellite (primers\n5F1 to 5R1) and two overlapping amplicons covering a 4.237-kb\nregion 3\u0002 of the minisatellite (primers 3F1\u20133R3 and 3F6\u20133R1).

We identified 53 polymorphisms in the 16 human\nsamples, with one additional SNP (INS-72) from dbSNP plus two\n(INS-73 and INS-74) described by Johnson et al. (2001). We geno-\ntyped all 56 SNPs using genomic DNA from our panel of unre-\nlated individuals from six populations by allele-specific oligo-\nnucleotide (ASO) hybridization to dotblots of the three PCR-\ngenerated amplicons described above (Wood et al. 1985; Jeffreys\net al. 1998). Each dotblot included amplicons used for sequence-\nbased SNP-discovery resulting in genotypes being determined by\nboth ASO hybridization and sequence analysis for 16 subjects\n(896 genotypes). No genotyping discrepancies between the two\ntechniques were observed. Furthermore, there was no evidence\nfor ambiguity at any of the resulting 21,168 genotypes. After\nBonferroni correction, none of the markers showed deviation\nfrom Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in any of the populations\ntested. Details of SNPs, ASOs, PCR primers, primate sequences,\ngenotypes, and allele frequencies, plus the full MVR data from\n1985 alleles analyzed in this and other studies (Stead et al. 2000;\nStead and Jeffreys 2000, 2002; J.D.H. Stead, M.I. McCarthy, and\nA.J. Jeffreys, unpubl.) can be found on our Web site (http:\/\/www.\nle.ac.uk\/ge\/ajj\/insulin).\nIn Silico Analyses\nHaplotypes were inferred from genotype data in silico using\nPHASE software (Stephens et al. 2001) available at http:\/\/\nwww.stats.ox.ac.uk\/mathgen\/software.html which can analyze\nmulti-allelic loci including minisatellite lineages and which as-\nsigns a probability of the correct inference of haplotype phase at\nevery heterozygous position. Each of the 22 minisatellite lineages\nwere given a unique identifier prior to analysis except for lineage\nI alleles, which were subdivided into the three main sublineages\nIC, ID, and IE. PHASE simulations were repeated five times. Dif-\nferences between outputs were minimal (<2%) and only involved\nhaplotypes determined with <95% confidence. In these cases, the\nmost common output was accepted. PHASE inferred haplotypes\nwith >95% confidence for 186 of the 189 non-Africans geno-\ntyped, and 171 of the 189 Africans. Incorporation of data from\nspecific alleles at the minisatellite (as opposed to minisatellite\nlineage) allowed haplotypes to be inferred with confidence from\na further two non-Africans and eight Africans. PHASE-inferred\nhaplotypes for all 378 individuals can be found on our Web site\n(http:\/\/www.le.ac.uk\/ge\/ajj\/insulin).\nSequence divergence between hominoids was estimated us-\ning Jukes-Cantor distances (Jukes and Cantor 1969) from an\nalignment of a 6774-bp region surrounding the insulin locus for\nwhich full sequence data were available. Human values were av-\neraged over the 32 complete sequences, inferred using PHASE\nsoftware from the 16 diploid sequences described above. To com-\npare our estimates of sequence divergence between humans and\nchimpanzees at the insulin locus (2.11%) with other autosomal\nloci, we randomly (with replacement) concatenated sequence\ndata from 53 noncoding autosomal loci described by Chen and Li\n(2001) until total sequence length matched that which was avail-\nable for the insulin region, after which sequence divergence was\ndetermined. Replication of this process 10,000 times generated a\ndivergence distribution of 0.96%\u20131.51% (between 2.5 and 97.5\ncentiles). A sequence divergence as high as 2.11% was never ob-\nserved, despite the insulin region containing coding regions un-\nder selective constraint.\nTo determine whether these great ape and human sequences\nwere evolving in a clock-like fashion, a relative rates test was\nconducted on the aligned sequences using TREE-PUZZLE soft-\nware (Strimmer and von Haeseler 1996) available at http:\/\/\nwww.tree-puzzle.de\/. This generated a likelihood test statistic of\n4.67 which fails to reject the molecular clock for this data\n(P > 0.05 assuming a \u00072 distribution with two degrees of free-\ndom).\nWe applied two tests of neutrality to the sequence data.\nTajima\u2019s D statistic (Tajima 1989) compares estimates of \b de-\nrived either from the average pairwise difference between se-\nquences, or from the number of segregating sites. Under neutral-\nity and mutation\/drift equilibrium these measures should be\nHaplotype Diversity at the Insulin Gene\nGenome Research 2109\nwww.genome.org\n Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press on August 19, 2013 - Published by genome.cshlp.orgDownloaded from \nequal, giving a Tajima\u2019s D value of 0. The Hudson\/Kreitman\/\nAguade (HKA) test (Hudson et al. 1987) compares levels of intra-\nspecific polymorphism with interspecific divergence between the\nlocus being investigated and a neutral reference locus. The ratio\nof polymorphism against divergence should be equal between\nloci if both are evolving neutrally, as both measures depend on\nthe underlying neutral mutation rate. In contrast, directional se-\nlection will cause a reduction in this ratio in the locus under\nselection. The lipoprotein lipase gene (LPL [MIM 238600]; Clark\net al. 1998), which has been used elsewhere as a neutral control\nfor HKA analysis (Fullerton et al. 2000), was selected as our ref-\nerence locus. Tajima\u2019s D and the HKA test were both analyzed\nusing the program DnaSP (Rozas and Rozas 1999) available at\nhttp:\/\/www.ub.es\/dnasp.\nFst calculations were performed on all SNP genotype data\nexcluding the insulin minisatellite, or on minisatellite lineage\ndata excluding flanking SNPs, from each population using Arle-\nquin ver. 2.000 (Schneider et al. 2000) available at http:\/\/\nlgb.unige.ch\/arlequin. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA;\nExcoffier et al. 1992) was calculated from pairwise distances be-\ntween SNP haplotypes and was performed using Arlequin ver.\n2.000 (Schneider et al. 2000). To investigate variation in the de-\ngree of population subdivision across the insulin region, we used\na program which performs a sliding window analysis of popula-\ntion subdivision (SWAPS), written by M.E. Hurles, which will be\ndescribed in detail elsewhere. Here, the program performs an\nAMOVA analysis (Excoffier et al. 1992) on 41 overlapping win-\ndows, each composed of 16 informative sites, shifting in position\nby a single SNP across the region analyzed. Larger windows re-\nduce resolution, whereas smaller windows produce more peaks\nand troughs by exaggerating the effects of individual population-\nspecific SNPs.\nLinkage disequilibrium (LD) was analyzed from diploid\ngenotype data (excluding the minisatellite) and plotted using\nsoftware described elsewhere (Jeffreys et al. 2001) which employs\nLD measures of both complete association (D\u0002) and absolute as-\nsociation (\u0005), and estimates the likelihood ratio (LR) in favor of\nsignificant linkage disequilibrium. Markers with minor allele fre-\nquencies below 0.15 were excluded from LD analysis; these mark-\ners tend to lack statistical power to detect LD and are also likely\nto be the result of relatively recent mutations and will not there-\nfore report on ancient recombination events.\nIndirect estimates of recombination activity were derived\nfrom the LD data using markers with minor allele frequencies\n\u00030.15. Assuming that crossovers are randomly distributed and\nthat haplotypes are selectively neutral and at crossover\/drift\nequilibrium, the expected rate of decay of absolute disequilib-\nrium (|\u0005|) with physical distance is given by |\u0005| = \u221a1\/(1 + 4Nerd)\nwhere Ne is the effective population size, r is the recombination\nfrequency per Mb, and d is the intermarker distance in Mb (Sved\n1971).\nAncestral relationships between inferred haplotypes were\ninvestigated using the Median-Joining (MJ) network algorithm\n(Bandelt et al. 1999) within NETWORK 2.0 software available at\nhttp:\/\/www.fluxus-engineering.com\/sharenet.htm. Haplotypes\nwhich could not be inferred with confidence were excluded. In-\nclusion of all full-length haplotypes generated highly reticulated\nnetworks due to historical recombination events. To reduce re-\nticulation, singleton haplotypes were excluded except for haplo-\ntypes of minisatellite lineages F and Z, as these lineages were each\nidentified only once in our data set. Haplotype lengths were re-\nstricted to a 3.6-kb block of linkage disequilibrium surrounding\nthe minisatellite and including all 26 SNPs between INS-11 and\nINS-40. Although networks were based on SNP data and not\nminisatellite lineage, lineage data were included in haplotype\ninference. SNP and minisatellite lineage data are therefore both\nrepresented within the network. The network was rooted at lin-\neages H, S, and V by comparison with the ancestral states of these\n26 SNPs determined from primate sequence analysis. The ances-\ntral state of INS-14 was ambiguous, so this site was discounted.\nMinisatellite structures in primates bear no similarity to human\nminisatellite lineages and are uninformative regarding ancestral\nstate (Stead and Jeffreys 2002).\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank J.
