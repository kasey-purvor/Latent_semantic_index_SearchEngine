It is\nrecognized that in self-supporting plants the mechanical\ntissue is generally arranged around the periphery of the\nstem; for example, collenchyma, vascular tissue and scler-\nenchyma tend to be located away from the centre of the stem\nto ensure a high degree of flexural rigidity. In contrast\nnon-self-supporting plants tend to have a centrally arranged\ncore of mechanical tissue to facilitate twisting and climbing\ngrowth habits (Usherwood et al., 1997; Speck and Rowe,\n1999). The mechanical design of plant roots has to a lesser\ndegree been reported (Coutts, 1983; Ennos and Fitter, 1992;\nEnnos, 1994, 2000; Gartner, 1994; Goodman and Ennos,\n1996; Niklas, 1999). In self-supporting plants a rigid\nelement is required to prevent overturning, usually achieved\nby a lignified central stele in monocots and secondary thick-\nening of dicot roots, whereas, in prostrate and climbing\nplants, a large number of fibrous roots with centrally\narranged mechanical tissue is desirable in order to resist\nuprooting yet allow roots to remain flexible.\nNot only is the gross arrangement of mechanical tissue\nwithin a stem or root important in determining its mechan-\nical behaviour, but also differences in cell wall ultra-\nstructure are known to have a significant impact. Polarized\nlight microscopy and X-ray diffraction have been used to\ninvestigate the orientation of cellulose microfibrils in the\ncell walls and this can be used to explain differences in\nmechanical behaviour (Cave, 1966; Preston, 1974). Cellu-\nlose microfibrils are believed to bear the tensile stresses\nwithin the cell walls and are the principal tension support\nmembers in plants (Niklas and Paolillo, 1997). Orientation\nof the cell wall microfibrils has been used to help explain\nmechanical behaviour in self-supporting plants such as soft-\nwoods Pinus radiata, Picea abies (Cave and Walker, 1994;\nFa\u00a8rber et al., 2001), hardwoods Quercus robur, Fagus\nsylvatica (Lichtenegger et al., 1999), and more recently,\nin two neotropical woody climbers, Bauhinia guianensis\nand Condylocarpon guianense, which switch from a self-\nsupporting growth phase to a non-self-supporting phase\nafter contacting a support (Hoffmann et al., 2003).\nHowever, no study has investigated the mechanical\ndesign of both the stems and roots of semi-self-supporting\nherbaceous annuals. Therefore, cleavers (Galium aparine),\na fast-growing herbaceous annual with a scrambling-\nascending growth habit, was chosen for this study. It is\nan important arable weed, commonly found in hedgerows,\nand mature plants often use upright species for support\n(Froud-williams, 1985; Taylor, 1999).

Both the\nstems and leaves, which occur in whorls at the node, are\ncovered in hooks; these are thought to aid attachment to\ntheir support (Fritsch and Salisbury, 1961) and allow the\nplant to climb without twining. However, plants are not\nrigidly fixed to their support and are often blown from\nsupporting vegetation in strong winds (Heathcote, 1987).\nHooks are also present on the mericarps which easily\nbecome entangled in animal fur thus aiding dispersal\n(Malik and Vanden Born, 1988; Gorb and Gorb, 2002).\nThe inspiration for this study resulted from observations\nof the contrasting form of the lower and upper stem of\nG. aparine. In particular, it was observed that the lower\nstem appeared to be highly extensible and relatively\nelastic \u2013 returning to its original length after stretching\nusing the hands. This is rather unusual in terrestrial plants\nand it is only in aquatic species of the buttercup family\n(e.g. Ranunculus fluitans) and marine macro-algae (e.g.\nNereocystis luetkeana), which have a central core of\nmechanical tissue, where similar mechanical behaviour\nhas been investigated (Koehl and Wainwright, 1977;\nUsherwood et al., 1997).\nTherefore this study aims to characterize the mechanical\nbehaviour of the stem and roots of cleavers and relate this to\nthe arrangement of structural tissue, the net microfibrillar\norientations in the cell walls, and plant growth habit. To\nachieve this, a series of experiments was carried out on\nfield-grown plants at the University of Lincoln, UK and\nthe mechanical behaviour of the stem and roots was tested\nin tension and the orientation of the cell wall microfibrils\ninvestigated using polarized light microscopy.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nBiological materials\nTo characterize the morphology and mechanical properties\nof the stem, material was collected from plants growing at\nthe University of Lincoln\u2019s Riseholme campus, Riseholme,\nLincoln, UK. Thirty mature plants were collected by care-\nfully untangling the stem from surrounding plants to avoid\nloading the basal area of the stem; any plants which were\ndamaged were discarded. All the plants were just starting\nto flower and were categorized as in the first generative-\nreproductive phase. This is when flowers are produced and\nfruits develop, but the main shoot continues to grow; the\nsecond is when terminal inflorescences are produced, elon-\ngation growth ceases, the fruit ripens and the mother plant\ndies (Groll and Mahn, 1986; Taylor, 1999).\nDue to difficulties in excavating intact root systems from\nfield soils (Fitter and Stickland, 1992), 32 plants were grown\noutside, in 5-L pots, to provide root material. Seeds were\ncollected in the previous year from the same site. Three\nseeds were placed in the centre of each pot and were\ngerminated in a sandy loam. Seedlings were thinned to\none seedling, selecting plants of uniform size, once the\nseedlings had produced the first whorl of leaves after 10 d.\nOnce the plants had developed two leaf-whorls, the pots\nwere placed outside in four rows and a fence was erected\nusing 20-mm square plastic mesh netting and garden canes\nspaced every 2 m to provide support for the growing shoots.\nOnce the plants reached the first reproductive phase, root\nsystems were taken to the laboratory for analysis.\nMorphology\nShoot systems from mature plants growing around the\nuniversity\u2019s campus were cut just below the soil surface and\ntaken to the laboratory for morphological and mechanical\nanalysis. The basal region of the stem was placed between\ndamp sponges to prevent water loss and the length and basal\ndiameter of the stem was measured using a ruler and dial\ncallipers, respectively.\nRoot material was collected from the pot plants and\nthe soil was carefully washed away from the root systems\nby submerging them in buckets of water and using a hose to\ngently remove the soil. The number and basal diameter of\nthe major first-order lateral roots, defined as roots with a\ndiameter >0\u00035 mm, 40 mm from the insertion at the taproot,\nwere measured.\nAnatomical observations\nTransverse basal sections, of the stem and first-order\nlateral roots, were cut using a single-sided razor blade\nand examined under the light microscope. Fresh sections\nwere stained with toluidine blue and phloroglucinol to\ndetermine the distribution of lignified tissues. These were\nphotographed and tracings were made to depict the location\nof mechanical support tissue. Sections were differentiated\ninto the parenchyma, vascular tissue, sclerenchyma bundles\nand the pith.\nOrientation of wall microfibrils\nTo investigate the orientation of cellulose microfibrils\nin the cell wall, longitudinal sections were taken of the\nstem, approx. 50 mm from the stem base, and first-order\nlateral roots, approx. 50 mm from where they joined the tap\nroot. Samples, 5 mm long, were taken from five plants and\nwere fixed using a mixture of ethanol (70 %), glacial acetic\nacid and formalin (18 : 1 : 1). Fixed specimens were then\ndehydrated, embedded in paraffin wax and sectioned (in a\nplane tangential to the epidermis) with a sledge microtome\nat 15-mm increments.\nTo determine the net orientation of the cellulose wall\nmicrofibrils the longitudinal sections were dewaxed,\nmounted in DPX and examined under polarized light. Single\ncell walls were viewed in polarized light with crossed polar-\nization filters and a quartz-sensitive tint plate (red plate)\n(Paolillo, 1995; Niklas and Paolillo, 1997). The sample\nwas rotated on the stage of the microscope to the position\nof maximal extinction and the angle between the longitu-\ndinal axis of the cell and the direction of the polarizer was\nmeasured using a graduated rotating stage with a vernier\nscale, allowing measurement to the nearest 0\u00031\u0002. The red\nplate developed blue\u2013yellow shifts in colour and a rose\n476 Goodman \u2014 A Mechanical Study of Cleavers\ncolour at extinction (Preston, 1974). This allowed more\naccurate determination of the maximum extinction point\nbecause the eye is much more sensitive to colour differences\nthan it is to intensity differences at low light intensity\n(Preston, 1974). The walls were the same colour as the\nfield when the net orientation of microfibrils was parallel\nto the axis of the polarizing filter.\nThe net angle of orientation of wall microfibrils was\nmeasured in ten cells of each cell type, in both the stems\nand first-order lateral roots. Measurements were taken from\nthe walls of tracheary elements and fibre cells (stem only);\nthe tracheary elements were subdivided into two types,\nthose with wide and those with narrow vessel members\n(Esau, 1977).\nMechanical tests\nMechanical tests were carried out on basal samples\n(120 mm) of the stem and first-order lateral roots and the\ndiameter was measured, at the midpoint, using callipers.\nThe basal region of the first-order lateral roots was defined\nas the region closest to the insertion at the tap root. Stem and\nroot samples were kept moist, before testing, by placing\nthem between wet sponges. Samples were tested within\n1 h of harvesting using a Universal Testing Machine\n(model 4443; Instron, High Wycombe, UK). Basal sections\nof the stem and root were clamped in the jaws of the Instron\nand stretched at a rate of 40 mmmin\u20131; the distance between\nthe clamps was 80 mm. A sandwich of neoprene rubber and\nsandpaper was used to prevent slipping.\nTo calculate the mechanical properties, 30 stems and\n30 roots were tested to failure. During the mechanical\ntests an interfaced computer plotted a graph of force (N)\nvs. extension (m) and the following properties were calcu-\nlated:\nThebreaking stresssmax (strength) is given by the formula:\nsmax = 4Fmax=pD2 \u00f01\u00de\nwhere D is the diameter of the sample and Fmax is the\nmaximum load the sample could withstand before breaking.\nThe breaking strain emax (extensibility) is given by:\nemax = dmax=L \u00f02\u00de\nwhere dmax is the extension at which the sample broke and\nL is the original length. Values of dmax and Fmax were only\nconsidered if the sample failed away from the clamps.\nThe Young\u2019s modulus (E) or stiffness of the stem and root\nmaterial was calculated by taking the initial computer-fitted\nslope dF\/dd from the force vs. extension graph and using the\nfollowing formula:\nE = 4LdF=pD2dd \u00f03\u00de\nStatistical analysis\nA Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov Test (Sokal and Rohlf, 1995)\nwas used to test the normality and similarity of the shapes\nof underlying distributions before proceeding with the\nanalysis. Analysis of variance was used to test for significant\ndifferences in the net orientation of the cell wall microfibrils\nbetween the cell types. All values in the text are means 6\nthe standard deviation.\nRESULTS\nMorphology\nThe stems of G. aparine ranged from 1\u000305 to 2\u000357 m in\nlength with a basal diameter of 0\u0003886 0\u000330 mm. They were\nanchored by a fibrous root system with between 10 and\n26 major first-order laterals with a basal diameter of\n0\u000387 6 0\u000311 mm. It was noted, but not quantified, that\nthe stem base was flexible allowing bending back on itself\nwithout showing visible signs of fracture.\nAnatomical observations\nExamination of transverse sections under the light micro-\nscope showed that in the lower stem (base+100 mm) there\nwas a central core of structural tissuewith only a small central\nlumen and narrow cortex (Fig. 1A). The vascular tissue was\nlargely composed of secondary xylem with vessels, fibres\nand sclerified parenchyma; staining with phloroglucinol\nshowed that the cell walls were lignified. The vessel mem-\nbers were arranged in an irregular manner (Fig. 1A). In con-\ntrast, further up the stem (typically >150 mm from the soil\nsurface), the transverse section showed a simple four-\nangled arrangement with four distinct non-lignified scler-\nenchyma bundles arranged in the corners of the stem\n(Fig. 1B). The vascular tissue was in a typical cylinder\narrangement with pith composed of parenchyma cells.\nIn the first-order lateral roots, structural material was\narranged centrally; staining with phloroglucinol showed\nthat this central core of vascular tissue was lignified (Fig. 1C).\nMechanical properties\nStem. The relationship between the stress and the strain had\ntwo distinct phases; first, an initial phase, where the struc-\nture behaved in a hookean (linearly elastic) manner up to\napprox. 5 % strain followed by yielding to 7 % and then\na second linear phase and eventual failure. Results showed\nthat the basal region of the stem was highly extensible,\nstrong, but also compliant; breaking strains of approx.\n24 % were recorded (Table 1).\nRoots. Similar results were obtained for the roots \u2013 again\ntwo distinct phases could be identified from the stress : strain\nplot. First, an initial linear phase up until approx. 6 % strain\nthen the root yielded to 7 %, followed by a second linear\nphase up until failure at approx. 28 % strain. The results\nindicate that the basal region of the first-order lateral root\nwas highly extensible, strong but also compliant (Table 2).\nOrientation of the microfibrils\nMeasurements taken using polarized light micros-\ncopy showed that there were significant differences\nGoodman \u2014 A Mechanical Study of Cleavers 477\nbetween the orientation of the cell wall microfibrils in\nthe different cell types of the stem (Table 3; P < 0\u000305;\nn = 5); microfibrils in the walls of fibres and narrow\nvessel members diverged from the longitudinal by\napprox. 13 % more than those from the wide vessel\nmembers.\nHowever, in the root, there were no significant differ-\nences in the net orientation of the wall microfibrils between\nthe narrow and wide vessel members (P > 0\u000305; Table 3);\nmicrofibrils diverged from the longitudinal by approx. 6\u0002.\nDISCUSSION\nIn some ways, the mechanical behaviour and structure of the\nlower stem of mature cleavers was similar to that of climb-\ning terrestrial species, which do not have to resist overturn-\ning forces generated by the wind. The mechanical tissue was\narranged centrally in the stem. Indeed, this centralized\narrangement of mechanical tissue has also been associated\nwith aquatic species, such as the long-leaved water crowfoot\n(R. fluitans) and giant bull kelp (N. luetkeana), which\ntypically experience tensile forces generated by water\nflow (Koehl and Wainwright, 1977; Usherwood et al.,\n1997). This contrasts with self-supporting plants where\nthe structural tissue is arranged more distally to improve\nthe rigidity of stems.\nThe mechanical properties of the tissues were similar to\nthose reported by authors studying young climbing plants;\nfor example, Ko\u00a8hler et al. (2000) reported that the central\ncore of young Aristolochia macrophylla stems had a\nYoung\u2019s modulus of 222 MPa similar to that of the\nlower stem of G. aparine reported in this study (Table 1),\nwhereas the whole axis of A. macrophylla was almost three\ntimes stiffer (Ko\u00a8hler et al., 2000). However, the results do\nshow that the mechanical behaviour of cleavers differs from\nother terrestrial species in a fundamental way; the lower\nstem is highly extensible, experiencing strains of up to 24 %\nbefore failing. It is unusual for the stems of terrestrial plants\nto withstand such high strains; for example, Ko\u00a8hler et al.\n(2000) reported breaking strains of only 7 % in the stems of\nyoung non-self-supporting lianas (A. macrophylla).

There is a centrally arranged core of structuralmaterial in both the lower stemandfirst-order lateral\nroots. The upper stem has the characteristic four-angled arrangement of mechanical tissue with non-lignified sclerenchyma in the corners.\nTABLE 1.

In the stem,\nmicrofibrils in the walls of fibre and narrow vessel members diverged\nfrom the longitudinal significantly more than those from the wide vessel\nmembers (P < 0\u000305; n = 5). Values are means 6 standard error.\n478 Goodman \u2014 A Mechanical Study of Cleavers\nonly in aquatic species, that similar breaking strains have\nbeen reported; a study investigating the mechanics of a\nfreshwater species, R. fluitans, reported breaking strains\nof approx. 15 % (Usherwood et al., 1997). However,\neven higher breaking strains of up to 38 % have been mea-\nsured in the stipes of marine macroalgae such as the giant\nbull kelp (N. luetkeana) (Koehl andWainwright, 1977). The\nfunctional significance of these findings may be that the\nstems of G. aparine are better able to cope with sudden\ntugs, in a similar way to the stems of aquatic plants cope\nwith changes in flow rate in their aquatic environment.\nIndeed, G. aparine is commonly found attached to self-\nsupporting species including other herbs and crop plants\n(Malik and Vanden Born, 1988) and so may have evolved\nin such away as to minimize the effects of a support which\nsways in the wind.Galium aparine is known to be dispersed\nby animals; the hooked mericarps are frequently found\nattached to the fur of animals. It is possible that an exten-\nsible stem may also help prevent the plant from being\nuprooted by passing mammals.\nThe mechanism by which the basal region of the cleaver\nstem permits the very high breaking strains is unclear; there\nis no evidence to suggest that a higher microfibrillar angle in\nthe vessels or fibres is responsible. Orientations of micro-\nfibrils in the stems were approx. 8\u0002. This is within the typical\nrange of values reported for self-supporting plant species\n(Cave and Walker, 1994; Niklas and Paolillo, 1997) and\nalso the neotropical woody climber, Bauhinia guianensis\n(Hoffmann et al., 2003). In contrast, microfibril angles in\nCondylocarpon guianense, another neotropical liana, were\nfound to be much higher, ranging between 27 and 31\u0002\n(Hoffmann et al., 2003) and in other climbing plants\nsuch as Aristolochia species approx. 20\u0002 (Ko\u00a8hler et al.,\n2000). However, these values are all substantially lower\nthan the high microfibril angle (60\u0002) found in the cortical\ncells of the marine macroalga N. luetkeana which is thought\nto permit the very high breaking strains of 38 % (Koehl and\nWainwright, 1977).\nSurprisingly, the anatomy of the stem does not shed light\non the mechanism behind the high breaking strains; one\nmight expect collenchyma tissue, which is often found\nin young developing plants, and is known to be responsible\nfor flexible support tissues (Esau, 1977), to be predominant\nin the stems of mature G. aparine stems. However, the stem\nof cleavers showed no obvious distribution of collenchyma\ntissue; the cross-section of the basal stem part was domi-\nnated by lignified vascular tissue (Fig. 1A) and the cortex\nconsisted of six or seven layers of parenchyma cells. A\npossible explanation for the high breaking strains may be\nthat lower levels of lignification are responsible; however,\nfurther experiments would be required to determine the\nchemical composition of the cell walls.\nThe high breaking strains recorded for the roots was\nless surprising; breaking strains of approx. 28% have\nbeen reported for the roots of wheat (Easson et al.,\n1995), but only 7 % for the roots of sunflower seedlings\n(Ennos, 1989) and approx. 10 % for the roots of tomatoes\n(Gartner, 1994).\nThere are several ways to test the mechanism by which\nthe stems ofG. aparinewithstand such high breaking strains\nand its importance to the survival of the plant. One is\nto compare the orientation of microfibrils in both extended\nand relaxed stems; it should be possible using trigonometry\nto calculate the theoretical gain in length resulting from the\nsteepening of the spiral angle during loading. A second test\nwould be to investigate whether subjecting the stem to\nhigh strains affects its water conductivity and to determine\nat what point this becomes detrimental to the growth of\nthe plant. If the flow rate was significantly reduced and the\nplant suffered a higher mortality then it may be that the plant\nnever experiences such high strains during growth and\nthat this is merely a secondary effect of another character.\nHowever, if this is a mechanism to help withstand high\nextensions one would expect the plant to be able to with-\nstand high strains without any detrimental effects on growth\nand reproductive success.\nIt is important that future work determines the mechan-\nism by which these high breaking strains occur and also\ncharacterizes how the mechanical properties vary along\nthe stem. Clearly more work needs to be done on a range\nof climbing and prostrate annual growth forms to deter-\nmine if stems with high breaking strains are more wide-\nspread among other herbaceous semi-self-supporting\nterrestrial species.\nIn conclusion, this study has shown that, in cleavers, the\nlower stem is highly extensible; breaking strains of approx.\n24 % were recorded. No other terrestrial plants have been\nshown to have such extensible stems. This may be related\nto the \u2018cable-like\u2019 arrangement of the structural material in\nthe lower stem, which was dominated by a central core of\nvascular tissue. The highly extensible basal stem may have\nevolved as a mechanism to help prevent the plant from\nbeing uprooted.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nI thank Professor Paolillo and Professor Karl Niklas for their\nadvice on measuring the orientation of the cell wall micro-\nfibrils; Mervyn Hobden and Amanda Mylett for technical\nsupport; and Dr Roland Ennos for discussions and com-\nments on the manuscript.\nLITERATURE CITED\nCave ID. 1966.
