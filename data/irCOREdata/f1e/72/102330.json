An \nincrease of the intensity and narrowing of the \nspontaneous emission spectra at increasing \ntemperature up to 200 K demonstrate the enhancement \nof carrier coupling between the dots and their \nrecombination via the states with lower transition \nenergies. A decrease of the emission intensity takes \nplace above -200 K, while the integrated spontaneous \nemission at the threshold current remains almost \nconstant due to increasing emission from the excited \nstates. The lasing line was very narrow in all the \ntemperature range (5 meV at 100 K and 1 meV at \n295K) demonstrating the high homogeneity of the \ndots. \nThe integrated sponpneous emission, L, from the \nwindow vs current at different temperatures is shown \nin fig.3 by the dashed lines. The peak intensity of the \nground state emission as a function of injected current, \nnormalised to the value of Lh at each temperature, is \nplotted with solid lines. The integrated spontaneous \nemission pins better at higher temperatures. The \npinning of ground state emission is better than that of \nthe total spontaneous emission spectra and it pins \nalmost ideally above 250K. This shows that the \nemission from the excited states causes the poor \noverall pinning behaviour observed at higher \ntemperatures, whilst the inhomogeneous carrier \ndistribution at lower temperatures leads to a complete \nlack of pinning of both the total and ground state \nspontaneous emission. The lack of pinning of the \nexcited state when the ground state is pinned by the \nstimulated emission is evidence of a bottleneck effect \nwhich prevents effective carrier thermalisation to the \nground state where lasing occurs.
