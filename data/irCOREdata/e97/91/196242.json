At the same time associated \napproaches to qualitative research such as the role of qualitative longitudinal research \n(QLR) have also attracted increasing attention (Neale and Flowerdew, 2003; Thomson \nand Holland, 2003; Farrall, 2006). As a contribution to these debates this paper focuses \non our recent foray in to the field of qualitative data reuse and qualitative longitudinal \nresearch. The discussion presented here draws upon our discovery, in 2000, of data from \na large-scale yet little known sociological study carried out in the 1960s. The dataset, \nstored in cardboard boxes in an attic office, originated from the project \u2018Adjustment of \nYoung Workers to Work Situations and Adult Roles\u2019 led by Norbert Elias at the University of \nLeicester between 1962 and 1964 and funded by the DSIR. Never fully analysed, the \ndataset comprised of 894 original interview schedules that document the work and life \nexperiences of Leicester\u2019s youth in the 1960s plus original supporting documentation \nrelating to the project such as letters, memorandum and notes. This dataset has \nsubsequently been used to form part of a wider ESRC project \u2018From Young Workers To \nOlder Workers: Reflections on Work in the Life Course\u2019.  This new study, carried out some forty \nyears later, involved the reanalysis of the 1960s data and the tracing and re-interview of \nrespondents who were now making the transition from work to retirement.   \n \nOur \u2018new\u2019 dataset therefore provides individual narratives of the life course spanning \ncomplete work histories. However, despite the quality and breadth of the data we have \n 4 \ncontinuously grappled with the methodological issues involved in reusing and reanalysing \ndata and then tracing and re-interviewing respondents from a study which took place \nalmost five decades earlier.  As such this is a project that has proved hard to define in \nmethodological terms. Our difficulty stems from the lack of clarity within existing \nliterature as to how best classify and define research which uses data both retrospectively \nand prospectively. Definitions of the various approaches to such research are unclear and \nthere is an ongoing debate not only of the value of revisiting existing data but also of the \nmethodological framework underpinning such studies.  \nTo explore these debates further the paper is structured in the following way.  First, we \nexplore the methodological approaches outlined above and move towards providing an \nexplanation of our own approach. We follow this discussion by outlining the \nmethodological framework used in this study and by describing the process of tracing \nand recontacting a cohort of respondents forty years after initial contact.  We then reflect \nupon the process of reinterviewing respondents and explore the value of such research \nfor examining and understanding change over time in the context of employment and \nwork histories. We begin by exploring in more detail the issues surrounding qualitative \nlongitudinal research (QLR).  \nQualitative Longitudinal Research \nRecent interest in the reuse of qualitative data or the secondary analysis of qualitative \ndata has generated substantial debate in the methodological literature. This is evident in \nthe publication of journal special issues on the subject of data reuse (see, for example, \nSociological Research Online, 2007 (12,3); International Journal of Social Research \nMethodology (7,1); Forum Qualitative Sozialforschung\/Forum: Qualitative Social \nResearch (1,3 and 6,1)). Access to archived data in the Qualidata Archive has enabled \nresearchers to revisit and reuse data from classic studies of the past, such as: Thompson\u2019s \n 5 \nstudy of the Edwardians (1975) and Goldthorpe et al.\u2019s (1968) seminal study \u2018The \nAffluent Worker\u2019, in order to make use of wholly pre-existing data by interrogating it \nwith new research questions. Alongside the relatively recent interest in data reuse, there is \na long tradition in social science research of carrying out restudies and replications, \nparticularly of classic sociological community studies (see Crow, 2002 for a detailed \ndiscussion).  By contrast to the approach of reusing existing qualitative data, restudies \nand replication are based on the creation of new data generated by new respondents but, \ncrucially, using the original research questions and revisiting the same geographical \nlocation. Davies and Charles (2002:1.1) define this approach clearly, adding the caveat \nthat a restudy should not have been part of the original research design: \n\u2018By a re-study we mean a deliberate intent to repeat insofar as possible a previous \nresearch study using the same research design and methods to investigate similar \ntheoretical concerns usually with the goal of better understanding social change. \nRe-studies differ from longitudinal studies in that they are determined upon post \nhoc, rather than being part of the original research design\u2019. \nA limitation then of restudies is that while broad patterns of social change may be \nidentifiable it is not possible to understand the impact of these changes on the individual \nlife course because, for the vast majority of restudies, it is the place that is revisited, not \nthe individuals.  This is where the new Young Worker Project takes on a very different \nand valuable perspective to other restudies and begins to move us away from the field of \nrestudies and in to the field of qualitative longitudinal research. \nQLR is, to some extent, a combination of the methods outlined above. In common with \ndata reuse, it involves reanalysis of pre-existing data from an earlier study using new \nresearch questions. However, in addition, QLR, unlike simple data reuse, involves the \ngeneration of new data and the use of the original research questions.  The most \n 6 \nsignificant way that QLR differs from both reuse and restudies is that the research is \nfocussed on the same respondents as the original study.  \n \nDespite the lack of a clear definition, how can we best define our own approach?  On the \none hand our own approach can be classified as simply a form of data reuse. However, it \ncan also be defined as a restudy or replication.   Perhaps most persuasively we can argue \nthat our methodological approach, or at least our approach in the follow-up study, best \nfits the field of qualitative longitudinal research. QLR, has, like data reuse, attracted \nincreasing attention in the literature in recent years (Holland et al. 2006; Farrall, 2006; \nCorden and Millar, 2007). Farrall (2006:2) defines QLR as: \u2018a range of mainly in-depth \ninterview-based studies which involve returning to interviewees to measure and explore \nchanges which occur over time and the processes associated with these changes\u2019. QLR, \nhe argues, is valuable when \u2018studying a process which has a notion of a \u2018career\u2019 of some \nsort or which involves a developmental process\u2019. This approach, as Thomson et al. \n(2003:186) note, appears to have been used most frequently in studies of youth \ntransitions, \u2018suggesting a particular relevance \u2026 when the process of change is \ncontinuous over an ill-defined period of time\u2019.  Therefore, we can argue that this \nmethodological framework suited our purpose very well as we were interested in \nexploring the process of the life course, with an emphasis on work and employment \nspanning a forty year period. Yet again, however, definitions remain unclear. Thomson et \nal. (2003) for example, suggest that a study such as ours would not be considered as QLR \nbecause the longitudinal dimension to the research was not part of the original research \ndesign. They argue that \u2018what distinguishes longitudinal qualitative research is the \ndeliberate way in which temporality is designed into the research process making change \na central focus of analytic attention\u2019 (p.185). Using their rather restrictive definition our \napproach would be considered simply as a follow-up study. Yet even for Thomson et al. \n 7 \n(2003:185) who initially appear to be very clear in their definition of QLR some \nconfusion remains as they go on to suggest that \u2018longitudinal research designs can be \nprospective cohort or follow up studies\u2019 and these \u2018can emerge by both \u2018design and \ndefault\u2019. Neale and Flowerdew (2003:189) go some way to explaining why there is still \nconfusion and significant debate around the concept of QLR, suggesting that  \u2018the \ncontours of this developing paradigm have yet to be articulated and clarified in any \ndetail\u2019. \nOur approach mirrors that of Corden and Millar (2007: 586) who propose a broader and \nlooser definition of qualitative longitudinal research, arguing that definitions such as \nThomson et al (2003) \u2018imply that the longitudinal focus must be part of the study from \nthe outset. In practice, however, longitudinal qualitative studies may come about in more \ndiverse ways\u2019. For them the important defining feature of such research is not that the \nlongitudinal element was included in the initial design but that the research includes \u2018the \ncapacity to analyse change over time\u2019 (Corden and Millar, 2007:586).  This, we argue, \nrepresents a fundamental strength of our data. Although the longitudinal element was \nnot part of the original design we now have a dataset which allows us to examine change \nover time, to examine process rather than outcomes (Thomson 2007).  \nThe Problems of Qualitative Data Reuse \nHowever, despite the obvious benefits and attractions of this approach it also raises a \nnumber of practical and ethical concerns - confidentiality, anonymity, the researcher-\nresearched relationship and the possible problem of \u2018auditing\u2019 \u2013 that need to be \nconsidered. First, in qualitative research it is usually those who collect the data who are \nanalysing the data (Dale et al., 1988). During the research process it is usually those in the \nfield who provide the guarantees as to how the data will be used and offer assurances \nrelating to anonymity and representation. Indeed, as Corti et al. (1995) suggests, a main \n 8 \nconcern with reusing qualitative data relates to the promises made regarding \nconfidentiality. A second concern is that in qualitative approaches the researcher often \nbecomes the research instrument (Dale et al., 1998) and the data produced is the end \nproduct of interview, reflection and interpretation. Here the researcher cannot be \nseparated from the data and as such one must question the ability of anyone else to re-\nanalyse and reuse the data. Indeed, the collection of primary qualitative data is based \nupon the relationship between the researcher and the research but no relationship exists \nwith later researchers who wish to reuse the data. It is also rare for those reusing data to \nhave access to contextual information from the original study and therefore it is difficult, \nif not impossible for the \u2018new\u2019 researchers to test the arguments of the original \nresearchers. Savage (2005:3), for example, argues that given the limited archival materials \nwhich still exist relating to Bott\u2019s work the researcher has \u2018absolutely no prospect of \n\u2018testing\u2019 Bott\u2019s argument\u2019. This, he argues, is because a \u2018great deal of her reported analysis \nwas based on her intensive and tacit knowledge of the respondents and is not now \namenable to be \u2018checked\u2019 against the existing data\u2019. Indeed, few researchers would \nsuggest that their aims in reusing data are to test the validity of earlier conclusions.  \nFinally, Hammersley (1997) argues that the secondary analysis process may lead to an \n\u2018auditing\u2019 of social research, raising ethical problems for the researcher as well as the \nresearched. For Hammersley \u2018the audit model could be taken to imply that the efficiency \nand competence of researchers can be assessed on the basis of archived material\u2019 (p. \n136). Corti et al. (1995) also report that researchers are concerned about secondary \nanalysis due to the possible methodological criticisms that could be made of the original \nresearch.  \n \nHowever, we feel that these concerns should not limit our usage or restrict QLR that \nbuilds upon data already in the public domain. For example, we have anonymised the \n 9 \ndata and removed personal identifiers once the tracing process was completed. We have \ngiven assurances to the original research team and interviewers that their anonymity will \nbe maintained as far as possible. They in turn have given permission for the analysis to \ntake place and both understand and accept that it is  \u2018not our intention to produce an \naudit of the efficiency and competence of researchers, nor is it our intention to imply in \nany way that the original research design was incorrect or invalid\u2019 (Goodwin and \nO\u2019Connor, 2007: 378).  We also agree with Heaton\u2019s (1998) assertion that, whilst one of \nthe limitations with secondary analysis of qualitative data may be the inter-subjective \nrelationship between the interviewer and the interviewee, it is often the case that more \nthan one researcher was involved in the generation of the data and, therefore reuse may \nnot be as problematic as first thought.  \nThe Young Worker Project \nWhere restudies have been undertaken the vast majority have been based upon classic \nsociological studies. Perhaps the best example of this is the \u2018Affluent Worker\u2019 study \n(Goldthorpe et al., 1968) currently the subject of a restudy by Savage (2005). It may be \nthat these classic studies have become the most reused and restudied because of the \nimportance they have assumed over time. This scenario seems likely as it is natural that \nsuch high profile research would attract the most attention from future generations of \nsociologists because these studies form the bedrock of modern British sociology. \nHowever, it cannot be ignored that another reason for the popularity of these studies lies \nin the accessibility of the data and its reuse is simply pragmatic; it has been archived and \nis easily accessible therefore it should be the first port of call for any researcher interested \nin restudies. Certainly, had other studies been archived in the same way it is likely that \nthese would also have achieved prominence in the field of data reuse. As Corti and \n 10 \nBackhouse (2005) lament, too many classic study datasets were lost before the Qualidata \ndata archive was set up.  \nThe Elias project is, however, an anomaly when compared to classic studies of the same \ntime period. While it clearly had the makings of a classic sociological study; it was a large-\nscale study led by a prominent sociologist of the period; it received considerable funding \nfrom DSIR, the predecessor the ESRC and the project personnel all went on to become \nsuccessful sociologists, the Young Worker Project differs from the classic studies simply \nbecause it never came to fruition as originally intended. There are a number of reasons \nfor this, for example, throughout the research Elias and the researchers disagreed about \nthe theoretical framework underpinning the research. For Elias the project aimed to \ncapture initial work experiences as he felt that the young people\u2019s experiences prior to \nwork would not prepare then for employment. However, according to Elias, the \nresearchers had interpreted the research to be a study of \u2018work\u2019 per se and that their \napproach was explore causal relationships between the different aspects of the sample \n(what Elias referred to as \u2018billiard ball\u2019 causality). Elias argued this approach ignored the \nrelationships and processes that constituted the young workers experience and that the \nresearchers were actually undertaking a different project to that originally proposed by \nhim. Elias suggested that the researchers lacked a basic understanding of his approach \nwhich, in turn, this led the researchers to perceive that Elias had no confidence in their \nability to complete the research. As one letter from the research team indicated \u2018every \nmeeting with you has ended in your saying that we cannot understand your ideas, that we \nare too concerned with numbers and statistics, too pedestrian, too inhibited by our \ntraining\u2019 (Keil 1964: 1). Second, there were methodological disputes. Those collecting the \ndata had previously worked on other large-scale quantitative research projects elsewhere, \nwhereas Elias, profoundly at odds with \u2018empiricist\u2019 approaches, preferred to concentrate \n 11 \nhis analysis on more detailed cases studies. In an interview for Platt\u2019s (1976) Realities of \nSocial Research, Elias suggested the researchers didn\u2019t believe his assertion that it was \npossible to develop a precise and straightforward research instrument that could access \nthe \u2018experiential side\u2019 documenting \u2018actual\u2019 experiences of the young workers. For Elias \nthe value of the study was not the production of statistically significant quantitative data \nbut in the ability to explore the transition to work as the young people experienced and \naccounted for it themselves. However, the research team were very critical of this \u2018case \nstudies\u2019 approach, arguing that the only valuable data would emerge from a factually \nbased survey with a large and properly constructed sample. As Keil (1964:1) suggests \n\u2018why else is there a need to interview 1,000+ young people if one is only concerned, in \nfact, with the experiences of 20 or 30 young people\u2019. Finally, there was an ongoing \nargument between Elias and the research over the researchers\u2019 right to publish. Those \nwho had collected the data wanted to publish articles and to disseminate their early \nresults. This Elias vetoed preferring instead a final report in which he would \nacknowledge the \u2018contributions\u2019 of the research team.  \nThese disputes have a number of implications for our research and analytical approach. \nFirst, the arguments over publication meant that the bulk of the data was never \npublished nor was a final report ever produced.  Indeed, it was only some ten years after \nthe conclusion of the \u2018failed\u2019 project that a publication emerged. The book \u2018Young \nWorkers\u2019 (Ashton and Field, 1976) was based on a small sample of interview transcripts \nfrom the project and it became a seminal text on youth transitions. It is fascinating, \nhowever, in the context of recent debates, that the Ashton and Field book was, in fact, \nthe product of data reuse as neither author was involved in the original research \nprogramme but the data all came from the original project. However, the bulk of the data \nwas never used and, in effect, provides us unused data from the 1960s that we used as \n 12 \nthe basis for the new qualitative longitudinal research project. Although not originally \ndesigned with that purpose in mind, this is an effective reuse of the data and means that \nthe original research was not undertaken in vain. Second, the methodological and \ntheoretical arguments led to a vast array of data being collected ranging from a \nrudimentary event history data to more exploratory questions focusing on money, \nrelationships, work, education and family. The compromise reached between Elias and \nthe researchers over the design of the research instrument has ultimately lead to the \nindividual young workers\u2019 lives being recorded in far more detail than a single survey or \nnumber of case studies could provide. We have in effect 894 in-depth interviews that \nhave, in the main, remained untouched since the mid 1960s. \n \nThe Young Worker Project Revisited \nThe overall aim of this study was to examine the process of adjustment to working life \nand retirement of a single cohort of male and female workers over the four decades \n1962\/3-2002\/3. This project comprised two key stages: first the data from the original \nproject was analysed and second reinterviews took place with one hundred of the original \nyoung workers, now facing retirement. This approach enabled us to explore (a) the \nadjustment these workers made on first entering the labour market in Leicester in the \n1960s, (b) the subsequent adjustments they made to changes in the local labour market \nand associated structure of opportunities in mid-life and (c) the ways in which they are \ncurrently tackling the approach of retirement in the twenty first century.  \nIn order for the reanalysis to take place, it was necessary to invest considerable time and \nresources to digitally archiving the data where possible. The first stage of this process \ninvolved entering all 894 interview transcripts into a database. This was an immense task \ngiven that each interview included some eighty-five mostly open questions alongside \n 13 \noften detailed, extensive interviewer notes. Often, as Gillies and Edwards (2002) \ndiscovered in their exploration of historical data, the handwriting was difficult to \ndecipher and this made the task considerably more laborious. We know, from the \ninterviewer notes and from paperwork relating to the project, that the interviews were \noriginally tape-recorded. However, as far as we are aware these tape reels were destroyed \nat some point and we have not been able to access these.    \nWe also collated files of paperwork relating to the original design of the project, the grant \napplication, original minutes from meetings and written correspondence between team \nmembers. Some of these materials had been archived along with the interview \ntranscripts, members of the original research team donated other material.  We were also \nextremely fortunate that Elias donated his life\u2019s work to an archive in Germany where it \nwas placed after his death. The archive held additional information on the project, much \nof it embedded in letters (and copies of replies) exchanged between Elias and the Head \nof Department (Ilya Neustadt) and Elias and the research team. Such detailed records \nhave enabled us to reconstruct, in part, the history of the project.  This has led us to \nconsider researchers of the future as it is likely that given the advent of media such as \nemail it is unlikely that they will have access to such a wealth of resources. Perhaps, as \nFielding (2004) suggests, qualitative researchers should be mindful of the archiving \nprocess from the outset of any research and keep all records relating to projects. This \nwould, of course, now include e-resources such as emails. However, given the \ncontroversy of the archive one has to question how many depositors would be prepared \nto include such information for future researchers to access (see Moore, 2007 for a more \ndetailed discussion).   \nHaving (re) analysed the original data we went on to trace and reinterview a sample of \nrespondents from the original project. These respondents, who were school leavers in \n 14 \nthe 1960s, were reinterviewed as they approached retirement. The value of the original \ndata increased dramatically as the study transformed from being simply a data reuse \nproject and became a rich piece of qualitative longitudinal research.  Undoubtedly this \nfind represented a research \u2018treasure chest\u2019 and few researchers will ever have such an \nopportunity to revisit a large-scale sociological research project. However, the existence \nof the Qualidata archive means that others do have access, or at least part access, to data \nfrom classical sociological research from the past.   \n \nFew researchers have attempted to carry out a restudy of the same scale as the Young \nWorker Project. This is, in many ways, hardly surprising. Access to archived qualitative \ndatasets has only recently become possible and such data is completely anonymised \nmaking the follow up of original respondents impossible.  Nevertheless, Thompson \n(2000: para 41) argues that: \n \n\u2018the most valuable qualitative datasets for future re-analysis are likely to have \nthree qualities: firstly the interviewees have been chosen on a convincing sample \nbases; secondly, the interviews are free-flowing but follow a life-story form \u2026 \nand thirdly, when practicable recontact is not ruled out\u2019.   \n \nIn principle we would certainly agree with Thompson and, indeed, we would argue that \nour follow up study fulfilled all three of Thompson\u2019s suggested requirements for \nreanalysis. However, it is important to consider the argument of Gillies and Edwards \n(2005:29) who suggest that: \n \n 15 \n\u2018it would be extremely time-consuming, and in many cases impossible, to trace \nthose who were interviewed in the 1960s in order to seek their explicit informed \nconsent. Further, this practice could be viewed as unethical in itself, given that \ninterviewees were often told that no further contact would be made\u2019.  \n \nWe now move on to consider these issues in more detail. \n \nTracing and Re-Interview \nTracing, or attempting to trace research respondents many years after the initial research \nencounter does, without doubt, raise a number of ethical issues. This was a serious \nconcern for our own research which, to be successful, required us to trace and \nreinterview respondents from the earlier study. Fortuitously for us, although as far as we \nare aware this project was not designed as a longitudinal study, the original interview \nschedule included a question which asked respondents to indicate if they would be happy \nto be reinterviewed at a future date. In order to comply with current ethical guidance as \nfar as possible, we decided to attempt to trace only those individuals who had indicated \nthat they were happy to be contacted again. Although it is unlikely that any respondents \nat the time of the original interview would have anticipated contact being re-established \nsome forty years later, we felt that we had, through this question, obtained a degree of \ninformed consent. However, it is important to point out that when re-establishing \ncontact and reinterviewing respondents we followed standard contemporary ethical \nprocedures such as giving respondents multiple opportunities to withdraw from the \nresearch at any point and providing assurances regarding data protection and data use.  \n \nWe originally aimed to trace and re-interview 200 of the original 894 respondents. Five \nhundred of the target sample indicated in the original interview that they would be willing \n 16 \nto participate in further studies and, in line with ethical considerations considered above, it \nwas this group who were the main focus of our tracing attempts. We adopted a multi-\nstrand approach to tracing. First, for those respondents who originally gave consent, we \nwrote to the last known address. Second, we made use of publicly available sources such as \nthe telephone directory, the electoral register and the website \u2018www.192.com\u2019.  We also \nmade use of the website \u2018www.friendsreunited.co.uk\u2019. This site aims to bring together \npeople who were at school together and includes names of those who register with the site \norganised according to school(s) attended and date of leaving school. As we had details of \nthe schools attended by the respondents we were able to identify those individuals in our \nsample had registered on this site. With the exception of Power et al., (2005) little attention \nhas been given to the potential of online resources such as Friends Reunited and 192.com \nin enabling researchers to make contact with individuals for the purposes of carrying out \nresearch. The use of such websites raises ethical issues which must be considered (Power et \nal., 2005) and we were mindful of this, for example, before using this method of contact we \nrequested permission from the site providers. However, we would agree with Power et al. \n(2005) that in terms of ethics this method of approaching individuals differs little from the \nmore traditional \u2018cold-calling\u2019 approach.  This method of tracing proved fruitful as the \nexamples from email responses below illustrate:  \n \nThanks for your e-mail. I really cannot remember taking part in the survey and would be \ninterested to know what I said. Yes, of course I would be pleased to talk to you. \n \n Sorry it's taken so long to reply to your e-mail. I have a vague memory of \nthe interview in 1963 but it was almost 40 years ago. Please let me know how I can be of help. I \nwill in any way I can. \n \n 17 \nNice to hear from you. No, I don't remember but delighted to help. Ask what ever you want. \n \nAlongside our mail-based campaign we used local print and broadcast media to appeal for \nthose who remembered being interviewed to contact us directly. Although this method of \ntracing respondents did generate a large amount of interest in the project it was not a \nsuccessful means of tracing those who took part.  Direct approaches to \u2018known\u2019 \nparticipants proved far more effective.  \n \nThe final tracing method was the use of personal contacts. We found that invariably those \nwe interviewed began talking about their old school friends at some stage of the interview. \nWe made a decision to capitalise on this and follow up on leads when interviewees \nmentioned individuals from our original sample. These proved very important not only in \ntracing certain individuals but also it enabled us to update our database, for example, we \nwere often told about people who had died in the intervening period and others who had \nmoved away from Leicester. \n \nUsing these methods we traced 157 of the original respondents of whom 97 were re-\ninterviewed. The tracing methods varied in their success, yet we would suggest that tracing \naround 18 per cent of the original sample represents a positive outcome for the study. \nHowever, whilst tracing worked well we became aware early on that our methods were not \ncapturing many women. Although the fact that fewer women than men were included in \nthe original sample explains this in part, it does not fully explain this situation.  The main \nproblem that we faced was that clearly many of the women had married since the original \ninterviews and were highly likely to have adopted their married names. This meant that \nusing techniques such as searching the electoral register and telephone directory, which \n 18 \nworked when tracing men, were ineffective when it came to tracing women. A trawl of \nlocal marriage registers also proved not only extremely time-consuming and expensive but \nalso ineffective. The difficulty in tracing women in clearly reflected in the final numbers of \nrespondents traced. Our final sample consisted of 97 individuals: 87 men from an original \ntotal of 634 and ten women from an original total of 260 female school leavers.  \n \nRe-Interview \nThe re-interview was semi-structured, covering topics outlined in the proposal and a \nwork life history diary. The research instrument included qualitative questions to allow \nthe respondents to elaborate on aspects of their lives. Despite our research instrument \nhaving some structure, the interviews tended to be more open and qualitative in nature. \nThe respondents often began the interviews by talking about significant life events which \nmeant the interview schedule had to be adapted during the interview process. We did not \nprevent any of the respondents from discussing issues that they felt were significant. The \ntime lapse of some forty years did cause difficulties with recall; some respondents for \nexample, brought complete CVs to the interview so that they could guide us through \ntheir work histories. We were asking respondents to reflect on a lifetime of work and \nwhilst for this proved relatively easy for those who had held only one or two jobs, others \nhad more chequered work histories and recounted careers with forty or more different \nemployers. However, as interviewers we found ourselves in the unusual position of \nhaving access to data about each individual forty years earlier. This sometimes meant that \nwe were able to prompt interviewees or to help them date particular events such as the \ndate they left school or to furnish them with contextual information such as how they \nsecured their first job, who they worked with and what time they had to be at work. Such \ndata reflects the minutia and mundane nature of everyday life which is likely to be \n 19 \nforgotten after such a large time lapse yet such information served as a valuable prompt \nfor some interviewees. As Farrall (2006:7) suggests \u2018QLR allows for respondents to \nreflect on the changes or lack of them which they have experienced since the previous \ninterview\u2019 indeed \u2018reporting to respondents what they said in a previous interview elicits \nbetter data\u2019. \n  \nThe majority of the interviews were taped with consent. Although not specified in the \nproposal, we decided to photograph all of the respondents and to collect photographs of \nthem from the 1960s. These were used as prompts during the interviews. The \nphotographs have subsequently been collated to form the basis of photography \nexhibition, combining the photographs with text from the research.  Once the interviews \nwere complete we invited all respondents and their families to an evening event at the \nUniversity of Leicester where we disseminated the findings of our work. We displayed the \nphotography exhibition and gave brief talks reflecting on key themes arising from the \nstudy.  \nReflections on Reinterviewing Respondents from a Lost Project \nIt is evident then that the Young Worker Project has a long and complex history both \nthe in terms of the evolution of the project and the various methodological issues which \nhave arisen over the past five decades. The project has impacted on many lives, not least \nthe respondents. We believe that the account of the project is intrinsically valuable to our \nunderstanding of the development of British Sociology because of the methodological \ninsights it provides and the fact that it highlights the quality of previous studies and the \npotential promise that they hold for current researchers. The accompanying interviewer \nnotes from the original project provide unrivalled insight in to the experience of being a \nresearcher during the expansion of Sociology during the 1960s.  However, this is not our \n 20 \nconcern in this paper. In this final section of our discussion we reflect on the value of \ndata reuse in a project such as this and we draw out the issues which we think gives this \nproject significant value to contemporary sociologists, in particular the potential for \nunderstanding change over time. \nWe have highlighted above various approaches to data collection and use. Each of these \napproaches: data reuse, restudies and replication and QLR are characterised by the \nsignificance of the concepts of time and change and retrospection and reflection.  Data \nreuse for example, is only possible because of the lapse of time between projects and the \nopportunity this provides to examine change through a temporal lens. Restudies and \nreplication are possible only because time has elapsed and the opportunity to research \nchange over time becomes a reality. Finally QLR is characterised entirely by research \ncarried out over an extended period of time. It is, therefore the concept of time that links \nthese approaches together.  \nNevertheless, there are issues relating to the definition of each of these approaches and \nwhilst in broad terms there is agreement over the meaning of each approach, there is \nlittle agreement in terms of process at the micro-level.  To some extent, we have fallen in \nto the same trap as many others, by using different methodological terms such as restudy \nand revisiting interchangeably. This, we argue, is because our project is so multi-faceted \nmethodologically that is has proved impossible to define in simple terms.  However, we \nargue here that our own confusion has helped us to clarify the concepts used throughout \nthe literature and to identify areas lacking precise definitions.  \nOur purposes in carrying out this piece of research were manifold. We wanted initially to \nsimply (re)use the data in order to understand more about the transition from school to \nwork in Leicester in the 1960s. The rich dataset that we discovered enabled us to do this. \nHowever, unearthing such a vast dataset led to the discovery of much more than simple \n 21 \ndata. We were also able to access extensive documentation relating to the project, giving \nus important contextual information. Added to these primary data sources was the key \npublication by Ashton and Field (1976). This publication, based on a sample of the \noriginal interviews, led the authors to devise a model of school to work transition which \ncontinues to be used as a framework for understanding school to work transitions. We \ndiscovered that Ashton and Field (1976) had identified each case by making a note on \nthe interview schedule. This system of noting the category for each respondent has \nenabled us to some extent, to \u2018test\u2019 the predictions of Ashton and Field for the future \ncareers of these young people with the luxury of both hindsight and foresight (Thomson \nand Holland, 2003). This is not to say however, that the reuse of qualitative data should \nbe concerned with \u2018testing\u2019 earlier arguments. The strength of such restudies lies not in \npotential the revisiting gives us to be \u2018critical both of what was said in the previous \nresearch and of what was overlooked\u2019 but more so to \u2018ground the analysis \u2026 in a way \nthat that attempts to discover the interconnected nature of the various social forces at \nwork\u2019 (Crow, 2002:4.3). Indeed therein lies the strength of a restudy; the unparalleled \nopportunity such an approach provides to begin to theorise social change over time. The \ndesire to explore change over time was, in turn, influenced by other aspects of Elias work  \n- especially his writings on the \u2018retreat of sociologists into the present\u2019 (Elias, 1987) in \nwhich he argues: \nThe narrowing of the sociologists\u2019 focus of attention and interest to the immediate \npresent, in some respects, undoubtedly represents progress in the development of \nthe discipline. Sociologists are now much better able than before to study and in \nsome cases solve short-term problems of their own society\u2026. The immediate \npresent into which sociologists are retreating, however, constitutes just one \nmomentary phase within the vast stream of humanity\u2019s development, which, \ncoming from the past, debouches into the present and thrusts ahead possible \n 22 \nfutures. It is not surprising, therefore, that the recent abundance of empirical \nsociological enquiries went hand in hand with an impoverishment in other respects \n(Elias 1987: 223-224). \nOr as Laub and Sampson (2003:284-285) have more recently suggested \nCritics whose gaze is limited to the present thus suffer in the end from a lack of \nscientific sense. Because our focus is on within-individual patterns of stability and \nchange, we must rely on longitudinal data that other investigators began collecting \nmany years ago in order to empirically study various life adaptations over the long \nterm. There is no other way to proceed. \nIndeed, these data have provided the opportunity to reflect on stabilities and changes \nover time and allowed us to reconsider the past.  Such opportunities represent the true \nvalue of this type of material. Whilst other writers have only been able to interrogate the \npast by asking respondents to reflect and recall what has gone before, we were able to \nreconstruct the past through access to data contemporary to that time. This has enabled \nus to question the accepted and orthodox views of the past and re-consider the \nimplications of past experiences for the present and possibly the future.  For example, we \nhave questioned the idea that the 1960s was a \u2018golden age\u2019 for school leavers where jobs \nwere plentiful and the prospect of unemployment unimaginable. However, examining \nthese data reveals that unemployment was a reality that for many school leavers of this \ntime and that it was not always easy to find jobs (Goodwin and O\u2019Connor, 2005). This in \nturn has had consequences for how their subsequent careers developed and how they \ncurrently experience work and employment. \nLikewise, by approaching the data reflecting longer-term historical processes, rather that \ntreating the past and the present as static and unconnected periods of time, has allowed \n 23 \nus to reuse this \u2018historical\u2019 data with contemporary concerns at the forefront of our \nminds. So, for example, at the time that the original data were collected the aspects now \ncentral to understanding society, such as issues of gender and ethnicity were not \nconsidered overly important to the analysis. We have re-examined the data, so far, by \nlooking in particular at what we can learn about gendered transitions from school to \nwork in the 1960s, an aspect of the transition experience neglected at the time of the \noriginal project (O\u2019Connor and Goodwin, 2004; Goodwin and O\u2019Connor, 2005a). \nIndeed, we have found ourselves in a very privileged position in having access to a \ncohort of individuals and data about those individuals both at the start of their working \nlives and as they approach retirement. Such data allows us to reconstruct individual \nlifecourses based on historical data and therefore not as subject to the well-documented \nproblems of recall in interviews. The lifecourse data we have also provides a snapshot of \nthe impact of macro-changes on individual lives and the way that fateful moments or \nepiphanies (Giddens, 1991) can be seen to shape the future of each individual. So, for \nexample, we have data on individuals who left school with a seemingly linear and secure \ncareer path ahead in well-established local industries such as hosiery and boot and shoe \nfactories losing their jobs due to the relocation of manufacturing. Such personal crises, or \n\u2018fateful moments\u2019 forced these individuals to \u2018seek advice, undertake research, and \ndevelop new skills\u2019 (Plumridge and Thomson, 2003: 216) in order to secure new and very \ndifferent types of employment. \nConclusion \nThe original Young Worker project was a large undertaking and immense amounts of \ndata on many aspects of young people\u2019s lives were generated by the original team.  The \nre-interviews have also generated a large volume of data and, when these datasets are \nviewed as a whole, the complexity and sheer size of the project is somewhat \n 24 \noverwhelming.  We would certainly agree with Thomson and Holland (2003:242) that the \nanalysis of qualitative longitudinal datasets is \u2018highly labour intensive\u2019 and presents a \nwhole set of new problems such as how best to \u2018do justice to the data while preserving \nparticipants\u2019 anonymity\u2019.  As such we have hardly scraped the surface of the data \navailable. We plan to continue our visit to the past by looking in more depth at other \naspects of the interviews, for example, we have detailed data relating to the transition to \nadulthood and independence which may provide us with a new perspective on this \nimportant life stage. \nWe therefore believe it is important to share our experiences and the insights we have \ngained in carrying out this study. Indeed the Young Worker Project offers an \nunparalleled opportunity for exploring many key methodological issues as it encompasses \nthe full gamut of data reuse:  restudies, qualitative data reuse and qualitative longitudinal \nresearch. This experience has led us to question existing use of the terms restudy, \nreplication, data reuse and qualitative longitudinal research as current use of these terms \nin the methodology literature is problematic and muddled. There is no doubt that such \nresearch is both valid and valuable and, given the increasing importance attached to the \narchiving of research data it is imperative that researchers share their own experiences \nand add to our understanding of the methodological issues which arise when making use \nof data from pre-existing studies. \n 25 \nReferences \nAshton, D. and Field, D.
