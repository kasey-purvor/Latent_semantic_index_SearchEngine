The data concerns their\n\u2018rapport\u2019 (Spencer-Oatey, 2003; 2005) with the members of staff responsible for\ntheir professional supervision and the paper assesses complaint behaviour across the\ntwo national groups. Basing our study on computer recorded discourse segments\ntaxonomically codified as \u2018negative assessment\u2019, we show that the incidence of\n\u2018indirect\u2019 complaint (Boxer, 1993) is significantly higher among English assistants\nthan among their French counterparts. A revised model for measuring \u2018severity\u2019\n(House and Kasper, 1981; Olshtain and Weinbach, 1993) is applied to the data\nusing corpus linguistic techniques. Its findings demonstrate that English assistants\nalso complain more \u2018severely\u2019 than their French peers. Nevertheless, the difference\nin linguistic behaviour between individuals within each group is shown to be\ngreater than that between the two national groups, implying that personality is a\nstronger determinant of cultural outlook than nationality.\n1 introduction\nTraditionally, \u2018complaint\u2019 was taught as a component of forensic rhetoric (Conley,\n1994). Until the advent of pragmatics, however, the topic was little studied\nas an object in its own right, other than from a purely descriptive or, more\nrecently, structural\/functional perspective (Halliday and Matthieson, 2004; Leech\nand Svartvik, 1994; Martinet, 1979). Since then, it has attracted closer attention from\nlinguists, emerging most recently as a fertile ground for cross-cultural comparison:\nbetween speakers of different languages or genders (Olshtain and Weinbach, 1987,\n1993) or in terms of its occurrence in different situations or discourse types (Boxer,\n1993; Ko\u00a8hl, 2006). Complaint has increasingly become seen as a signifier of cultural\n75\nRobert Crawshaw, Jonathan Culpeper and Julia Harrison\ndifference and one of the most complex features of negotiation, even between West\nEuropean cultures which might be thought to share broadly similar traditions. As\nsuch, it is assumed to be governed by convention, both national and contextual,\nrather than by universal pragmatic principles (Spencer Oatey, 2003; 2005). Insofar as\npragmatics was derived from the study of live interaction, it is perhaps not surprising\nthat, notwithstanding recent interest in e-mail correspondence (Ko\u00a8hl, 2006),\ncomplaint should have been analysed primarily from a face to face perspective.\nFollowing Brown and Levinson (1978) and Leech (1983), Olshtain and Weinbach\n(1993: 108) define complaint as\na speech act where the speaker (S) expresses displeasure or annoyance \u2013 censure \u2013 as a\nreaction to a past or on-going action, the consequences of which are perceived by S as\naffecting her unfavourably. This complaint is usually addressed to the hearer (H) whom\nthe S holds, at least partially, responsible for the offensive action.\nBy implication, this definition excludes what, following D\u2019Amico-Reisner\n(1985), we refer to in this paper as \u2018indirect complaint\u2019, that is instances where\nthe complainant is expressing his\/her feelings to someone other than the person\nseen to be responsible for the source of the problem. Indirect complaint sheds light\non \u2018how complaining functions as a social strategy\u2019 (Boxer, 1993: 107). It serves\nas a window on the potential causes of cross-cultural misunderstanding and places\nthem in a wider social, cultural and political context.\nThe corpus under review in this paper offers an example of the kind of indirect\ndata just described. It emanates from an Anglo-French, ESRC-funded, project,\nPragmatics and Intercultural Communication (PIC), aimed at identifying the factors \u2013\ncultural, linguistic, institutional, political, personal \u2013 which determine the outcomes\nof communication between language assistants and teachers in schools in France\nand England (see www.lancs.ac.uk\/fass\/projects\/pic\/ for details). 57 students (24\nFrench and 33 English) from 8 universities and working in different types of\nschool in England and France kept audio-recordings and written accounts of\nmeetings with their mentors\/responsables. The students participated in the project\nvoluntarily. The results of a standard, globally recognised, academically approved,\npersonality test showed them collectively to be well above average in all the \u2018Big 5\u2019\nparameters: \u2018extraversion\u2019, \u2018agreeableness\u2019, \u2018conscientiousness\u2019, \u2018emotional stability\u2019\nand \u2018openness\u2019 (http:\/\/www.lancs.ac.uk\/fass\/projects\/pic\/data\/personalityresults).\nIn their commentaries, they took advantage of the opportunity to express\ntheir reactions towards certain aspects of their professional experiences, both\npersonally and in terms of what they saw as the wider cultural determinants\nof the behaviours they encountered. The conditions under which the students\ngenerated the data and their prior induction into the objectives and procedures\nof the project are described in detail in the project report (http:\/\/www.lancs.\nac.uk\/fass\/projects\/pic\/outputs\/reports). Following the principles of \u2018grounded\ntheory\u2019 (Glaser and Strauss, 1967; Richards and Richards, 1991), the corpus was\nword-processed and codified using the software programme Atlas ti5, reliability\nbeing qualitatively assured through regular meetings between codifiers before and\n76\nA comparative study of incidence and severity in indirect complaint in French and English\nduring the process before being finally checked by the research assistant to the\nProject. It was classified according to a taxonomy of topics and \u2018speech types\u2019\n(http:\/\/www.lancs.ac.uk\/fass\/projects\/plc\/data).\nThe data sample on which this paper focuses consists of segments of discourse\ncodified as \u2018negative assessment\u2019, which we identified as co-terminal with indirect\ncomplaint in the terms defined above. For the purposes of this paper, these are\ndefined as \u2018negative evaluation segments\u2019 (henceforth NES). Systematic qualitative\nand quantitative comparison between the two subsets just described revealed lin-\nguistic differences which we wish to argue are culturally marked. Using an approach\nderived from corpus linguistics and discourse analysis, our aim is to identify and\ndefine those differences, focusing on the incidence of complaint amongst the two\nsample groups and its degree of \u2018severity\u2019 (Olshtain and Weinbach, 1993).\n2 top ic, context and background\nWhile topic is clearly an integral feature of complaint and is the most immediately\ntangible basis for cultural comparison, the principal focus of this paper is on\nlanguage rather than on the cultural determinants of linguistic behaviour. We have\nexplored elsewhere the main sources of concern expressed by the participants in\nthe project, as well as their potential cultural and political implications (Crawshaw,\n2005; Crawshaw and Harrison, 2007; Culpeper, Crawshaw and Harrison, 2008).\nAt the same time, any comparison between the behaviour of the two experimental\ngroups is only significant insofar as the underlying contexts in which they found\nthemselves can be described as culturally equivalent. With this in mind, the\nfollowing points concerning the design and outcomes of the study should be\nnoted. Politically and institutionally, the national situations of the language teaching\nassistants corresponded to each other, whatever local contextual differences might\nhave applied. It was inevitable that negative remarks were in some cases directed\ntowards the person. However, the source of discomfort in the relationship might\nbe due as much to the institutional environment as to behaviour on the part of the\nmember of staff concerned. Unlike in England where the mentor was generally the\nhead of the French department and could therefore control the assistant\u2019s timetable,\nin France, there was no equivalent position. The role of \u2018head of department\u2019 did\nnot exist and the assistant was obliged to negotiate his\/her timetable with a number\nof different teachers. It followed that more administrative initiative was demanded\nof the English in France than vice versa. The jobs they were required to undertake\nand the staff to whom they were responsible were more diverse. Many assistants\nwere allocated to more than one school, thus doubling the amount of negotiation\nneeded. It was not surprising therefore that English students complained more\nof \u2018disorganisation\u2019 and \u2018inefficiency\u2019, despite being aware that the limited role of\nthe \u2018responsable\u2019 within the French system made the task of establishing a coherent\ntimetable intrinsically more difficult. Clearly, no objective comment is being made\nabout the strengths or weaknesses of either of the two educational cultures. These\nperceptions were those of the students themselves and have strictly relative status.\n77\nRobert Crawshaw, Jonathan Culpeper and Julia Harrison\nTable 1.

French assistants were frustrated at\nhaving to devote time to the mindless reiteration of situational dialogues without\nbeing able to explain to pupils the meaning of the structures they were trying to\nlearn. They were also sensitive to the failure of English mentors to fulfil verbal\nundertakings which they interpreted as evidence of insincerity or even hypocrisy.\nHowever, given that it is not the purpose of this paper to make cultural inferences\nbut rather to present empirical findings, the object of complaint is less relevant in it-\nself than as a factor in gauging incidence and severity, as will be demonstrated below.\n3 incidence\nWhatever the degree of equivalence in the topics giving rise to complaint,\nquantitative analysis of the data confirmed the initial impression that the incidence\nof complaint was significantly higher amongst the English informants than it was\nfor the French.\nTable 1 reveals that of the 33 English students participating in the project, 27 -\nor 81.8% of the experimental cohort - supplied data which included codified\nsegments of discourse classified as \u2018negative\u2019.\nThis compares with an equivalent 66.6% amongst the French cohort in England.\nWhen combined with differences in the average number of NESs per student,\nthe immediate conclusion to be drawn is that more English felt aggrieved than\ndid their French counterparts, though this finding might equally be due to the\nfact that the French were being more respectful towards their English hosts, given\nthat the research was being conducted by English nationals. The difference in\nthe incidence of complaint between the English and the French assistants was\nnevertheless so marked that we thought it advisable to check whether variable\ndistribution in the volume of NESs amongst the individual subjects had distorted\n1 The acronym \u2018NES\u2019 stands for \u2018Negative Evaluation Segment\u2019, meaning those segments\nin the corpus which were codified under the heading \u2018Negative Evaluation\u2019\n78\nA comparative study of incidence and severity in indirect complaint in French and English\nTable 2. Distribution of complaint (English in France)\nTable 3. Distribution of complaint (French in England)\nthe figures. Tables 2 and 3 show that, on the contrary, the distribution curves of\nthe two subject populations were very similar, corresponding in all likelihood\nto a similar differential in the range of personality and outlook within the\ntwo samples.\n79\nRobert Crawshaw, Jonathan Culpeper and Julia Harrison\n4 measuring \u2018severity \u2019\nAs distinct from most instances of complaint recorded in live situations, the indirect\ncomplaint data analysed in this paper was delivered in written or recorded form with\nno expectation that it would lead to action on the part of the recipient. This did not,\nhowever, preclude identifying the degree of illocutionary force conveyed by the\nlanguage of complaint as a potentially relevant aspect of cross-cultural comparison.\nHouse and Kasper (1981), Trosborg (1995) and Ko\u00a8hl (2006) have recourse to the\nterms \u2018intensifiers\u2019, \u2018upgraders\u2019 and \u2018downgraders\u2019 to identify specific features which\nserve to intensify or reduce the impact of the speech event. Together with other\nmarkers, these features, hitherto applied only to direct complaint, needed to be\nharnessed and simplified if degrees of severity in the data were to be captured and\ncompared objectively.\nWe therefore reduced the collective components of the two most cited models in\nthe literature on complaint: House and Kasper (1981) and Olshtain and Weinbach\n(1993), to three fundamental parameters:\n(1) Abstraction\/concreteness: how clearly defined is the \u2018event\u2019 about which\nthe complaint has been formulated?\n(2) Objectivication\/personalisation: (a) to what extent is an individual\nidentified as being personally responsible for the event which has given rise\nto the complaint? (b) Correspondingly, to what extent does the complainant\nidentify personally with the point of view expressed?\n(3) Detachment\/intensity: how \u2018strongly\u2019 expressed is the articulation of the\ncomplaint? i.e. in terms of the language used, how powerful are the feelings\nof the complainant about the incident?\nIn each case, through close analysis of the corpus, we sought to identify a\nseries of features which might contribute to the weight to be attached to each\nparameter. Consider the following two examples of complaint concerning lack of\nprofessionalism:\n(a) \u2018On reflection, I think that both teachers behaved in very unprofessional\nways. I know they don\u2019t get on and I also know that they both want to help\nme [. . .] but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair of them to \u201cbad mouth\u201d each other to\nme\u2019\n(b) J\u2019ai e\u00b4te\u00b4 surtout de\u00b4c\u00b8ue par le comportement de certains. Je me suis rendu compte\nque quelques-uns (heureusement pas tous) sont tre`s imbus de leur personne\u2019.\nIn extract (a), concreteness markers are first, the referentiality of the phrase \u2018both\nteachers\u2019, insofar as the adjective \u2018both\u2019 and the designation of the profession\n\u2018teachers\u2019 clearly indicate that the complainant has two specific individuals in mind,\na fact which is reinforced by the anaphoric repetition of the personal pronoun \u2018they\u2019\nand \u2018both\u2019 and second, the simple past morpheme \u2018-ed\u2019, which denotes a particular\nevent in which the two colleagues \u2018bad mouthed\u2019 each other, so making explicit the\ncause of the complainant\u2019s feelings. By contrast, in (b), \u2018le comportement\u2019 is unmarked\nwhen juxtaposed with \u2018behaved\u2019 while \u2018both teachers\u2019 is marked when compared\n80\nA comparative study of incidence and severity in indirect complaint in French and English\nwith the French \u2018certains\u2019, where the referent is not specified. \u2018J\u2019ai e\u00b4te\u00b4 de\u00b4c\u00b8ue\u2019 and\n\u2018Je me suis rendu compte\u2019 in (b) are less specific in terms of their location in time\nthan the simple past tense of (a). Similarly, despite the ironic tone, the general\nattitude evoked by \u2018imbus de leur personne\u2019 is unmarked by comparison with the\nspecific occasion invoked by \u2018bad-mouthed each other\u2019. Overall, on the linguistic\nevidence, example (a) is more specific\/explicit than (b).\nFrom the perspective of \u2018objectivication\/personalisation\u2019, (a) is apparently at a\nhigher point on the hypothetical scale than (b). The first person singular pronoun \u2018I\u2019\noccurs four times in (a) as against two occurrences of \u2018je\u2019 in (b) and is accompanied\nby an object pronoun \u2018me\u2019 which is antithetical to the \u2018them\u2019 of the previous\nphrase. The point of view in (b) is more distanced, more evaluative, whereas (a) is\ndirectly concerned with the relationship between the assistant and the two teachers\nconcerned. A slightly different picture emerges if the same examples are considered\nfrom the strict point of view of \u2018intensity\u2019. This is marked in (b) by the adverb\n\u2018surtout\u2019 and the choice of word \u2018de\u00b4c\u00b8ue\u2019. The \u2018I think\u2019 in (a) matches the \u2018Je me suis\nrendu compte\u2019 in (b), and a \u2018downgrading\u2019 effect is conveyed by the qualification in\n(a) of \u2018I know. . . but. . .\u2019 which reduces the intensifying effect of the metonymical\n\u2018bad-mouth\u2019.\nThus, close analysis bears out an instinctive reading of the two examples, namely\nthat despite being less \u2018intense\u2019 from a strictly technical point of view, the second,\nEnglish, statement, is overall more \u2018severe\u2019 as an example of complaint due to\nthe greater specificity of the event referred to and the extent to which blame\nis ascribed to the other party. The question was how far a methodology based\non close stylistic deconstruction of individual extracts could be extended to the\ndata as a whole. First, for each parameter, a reliable system of measurement was\nrequired. Meaningful features would need to be identified and subjected to corpus\nanalysis, before eliminating examples deemed irrelevant. The compensatory effects\nof downgraders on upgraders would have to be taken into account. As with the\nmeasurement of incidence, any imbalance between the overall aggregates would\nneed to be qualified by comparing the average occurrences of given features: in\nrelation to the number of complainants and to the number of NESs.\nAbstraction\/concreteness\nFor strictly analytical purposes, deixis denoting concreteness was defined in terms\nof a limited set of linguistic features. These included demonstrative adjectives\n(this, that, these\/ce, cet, cette, ces), demonstrative pronouns (it, that, there\/cela,\nc\u00b8a, celui-ci etc.), definite articles (the\/le, la, les), and adverbs and adverbial\nphrases (when, then, a bit later, after a few minutes. . .\/a` ce moment-la`, quand,\nlorsque, aujourd\u2019hui, au bout du compte. . . etc.). Running a Wordsmith concordance\non French demonstrative adjectives ce, cet, cette, ces yielded a total frequency count\nof 131 which could be reduced to 51 by discounting occurrences of the emphatic\nrelative form \u2018ce qui\/ce que\u2019. This compared with a total of 127 occurrences of\nthe adjective \u2018this\u2019 amongst the English (following adjustment to take account of\n81\nRobert Crawshaw, Jonathan Culpeper and Julia Harrison\nthe higher number of English students registering NES\u2019s). The same disproportion\napplied to the occurrences of the definite article \u2018the\u2019 when compared to the\ncombined aggregation of occurrences amongst the French cohort of \u2018le\u2019, \u2018la\u2019, \u2018les\u2019:\n395 for the French versus 495 (adjusted) for the English: more than 25% higher.\nSimilar differences emerged when comparing adverbs of time. The aggregation\nof \u2018quand\u2019, \u2018alors\u2019, \u2018au bout du compte\u2019, \u2018ensuite\u2019, \u2018puis\u2019 and \u2018enfin\u2019 yielded a total\nof 62 occurrences, as against an adjusted total of 94 of the approximate English\nequivalents: \u2018when\u2019, \u2018then\u2019, \u2018at which point\u2019 and \u2018finally\u2019 (still 34% higher). The\nstatistics appear to bear out the assertion that, as well as complaining more, the\nEnglish students do so with a higher degree of \u2018concreteness\u2019 than the French, a\nfinding which is all the more striking when it is noted that the average number of\nwords per NES is only slightly more for the English than for the French (124 vs.\n119). It also seems from the high frequency of the adverbs \u2018when\u2019 and \u2018then\u2019 that,\nwhen describing the object of their complaint, they do so in narrative mode, with\nreference to a specific event which is related in more chronological terms than was\nthe case for the French students.\nAgency\/Personalisation\nIt was immediately apparent from a reading of a NES to what extent the blame\nattached to the person rather than to the event per se. Within the data as a whole there\nwas little to distinguish between the two cohorts. In each group, there were only\ntwo students who referred exclusively to the phenomenon giving rise to the comp-\nlaint without using the behaviour of a particular individual as the primary motive\nfor doing so. It revealed the readiness with which even sensitive and highly educated\nyoung people were predisposed to identify people with their cultural contexts. In\nthe majority of cases, the process was metonymical: the behaviour of the individual\nwas seen as a function of the institutional\/cultural context or in more extreme\ncases, as an expression of previously held stereotypes of the host culture:\n(c) \u2018Je m\u2019attendais a` un peu plus de chaleur et de communication, mais non, pas ici! C\u2019est\nvraiment l\u2019image que je me fais des Anglais pour le moment, apre`s deux mois. Gentils,\npolis, courtois, c\u00b8a il n\u2019y a pas de proble`me. Mais quand il est question d\u2019e\u00b4changer, de\ncommuniquer, d\u2019aller plus loin dans la communication, la` les choses se compliquent\nse\u00b4rieusement. . .\u2019\n(d) \u2018A cynic may say that Mme. G.\u2019s reaction was typically \u2018French\u2019 because she\nhas acknowledged that there is a problem but didn\u2019t attempt to remedy it -\nWho knows?\u2019\nHowever, while \u2018agency\/personalisation\u2019 relates in part to the person who is the\nobject of the complaint, it is equally reflected in the degree to which complainants\nthemselves identify with the source of the grievance. From this perspective, the\nEnglish were significantly more personal in the way they described their experience.\nThe data recorded a total of only 317 occurrences of \u2018je\u2019 or \u2018j\u2019\u2019 amongst the French.\nThis contrasted with an equivalent (adjusted) total of 786 occurrences of \u2018I\u2019 on the\n82\nA comparative study of incidence and severity in indirect complaint in French and English\npart of the English. By any standards, the difference was striking. Was it really a\nfeature of French linguistic behaviour that student native speakers writing personal\ncommentaries in the context of a research project routinely eschew the first person\npronoun in favour of more impersonal forms of expression? The findings pointed\nstrongly in this direction.\nIntensity\nIt proved possible to assess intensity using a mixed qualitative and quantitative\napproach by counting the occurrences of linguistic features such as superlatives and\nadverbial intensifiers, together with rhetorical figures such as metaphor, anaphora,\naccumulation, exclamation, expletive, irony, rhetorical questions and quotation.\nThe features were systematically aggregated on the basis of close reading. Such an\napproach is clearly more subjective than corpus based analysis, but no less revealing.\nAs an illustration of the method employed, consider the extract below from one of\nthe more outspoken of the French informants:\n(e) \u2018Actually I wasn\u2019t entirely satisfied. I feel so annoyed to listen to this interview,\nEllen annoys me but I think it\u2019s because the interview was given only on\na transactional level. Elle ne s\u2019est pas mise a` ma place sur le plan e\u00b4motionnel.\nC\u2019est expe\u00b4die\u00b4. Simple e\u00b4change d\u2019informations. J\u2019 e\u00b4tais vraiment lost et totalement\ndans l\u2019inconnu, tre`s fatigue\u00b4e a` cause de l\u2019immersion linguistique. Et Ellen n\u2019a rien\ndonne\u00b4, n\u2019a rien dit pour me rassurer \u2018en profondeur\u2019, elle n\u2019a pas demande\u00b4 vraiment\ncomment je ressentais les choses. Elle ne veut pas s\u2019investir e\u00b4motionnellement - entretien\nintellectuel, sans sentiments, sympa, sociable mais pas de vraie e\u00b4motion et inte\u00b4re\u02c6t\nsince`re. Sur le coup, je n\u2019ai pas pris conscience vraiment que j\u2019e\u00b4tais frustre\u00b4e par cet\nentretien. Me\u02c6me ce que j\u2019ai dit dans mon te\u00b4moignage, on sent que je suis frustre\u00b4e, je\nne suis pas vraiment satisfaite de mon entretien. Je dis \u201c Elle jouait un ro\u02c6le, elle n\u2019e\u00b4tait\npas elle-me\u02c6me quoi \u201c. Elle est fausse ce qui ne pose pas les bases pour une bonne\nrelation sur le plan interpersonnel, affectif.\u2019\nIntensity markers are highlighted in bold in the extract cited. The author clearly\nfeels strongly that the interview has not gone well. Individual elements include\nadverbs such as \u2018so\u2019 and \u2018tre`s\u2019, adverbial intensifiers (\u2018vraiment\u2019, \u2018totalement\u2019), the\npronoun (\u2018rien\u2019) and lexical items which can only considered dismissive in the\ncontext (\u2018annoys\u2019, \u2018simple\u2019, \u2018frustre\u00b4e, \u2018fausse\u2019). In addition, the rhetorical impact of\nstructural features can also be taken into account. Hence, the repetition of the\nadverbs \u2018vraiment\u2019 and \u2018totalement\u2019 in syntactically equivalent positions, together with\nthe anaphoric negative forms (ne. . . pas) add to the force of the complaint, as does\nthe double ellipses in apposition (\u2018entretien intellectuel, sans sentiments\u2019). The attitude\nof the complainant as revealed in this NES is, at the very least, uncompromising.\nAs with the marking of scripts written by foreign language learners, a combined\nquantitative\/qualitative approach of this kind demands judgement. Nevertheless, as\nwith language scripts, subjectivity can be minimised by sharing the process with\nmore than one evaluator, and, if applied rigorously, highlights significant trends.

Once again, the findings were startling\nand confirmed the overall impression gained so far. The word \u2018vraiment\u2019 occurred 26\ntimes in the French sample against an adjusted total amongst the English of 48. \u2018Tre`s\u2019\ndid not occur once amongst the French while for the English, the adjusted figure\nfor \u2018very\u2019 was 57! Even if the underlying strength of feeling on the part of both\ngroups of students were deemed to be equivalent, the evidence suggests otherwise\nand indicates strongly that the English were more extreme in the intensity as well\nas in the volume of their complaints.\nMoreover, as Table 5 indicates, the adjusted average of intensity markers for the\n5 lowest scoring French informants was \u20131.00 against an equivalent figure of +1.40\namongst the English. This is explained by the fact that at the bottom end of the\nscale, French informants recorded more downgraders than upgraders in their texts\nand therefore registered a negative score. Not only were the French students less\nprone to complain than the English, but those who did were more mitigated in\ntheir expression than their English counterparts, revealing it seems a lesser degree\nof conviction that they were necessarily in the right.\nHowever, regardless of the comparative differences in linguistic behaviour\nbetween the two groups, one qualitative finding was clear. Expressed quantitatively\nin terms of the total number of upgraders minus the total number of downgraders,\n84\nA comparative study of incidence and severity in indirect complaint in French and English\nthe differential range in the intensity of complaint by individuals far outweighed\nthat between the two national cultures. The English may have been 2.13 times\nmore \u2018intense\u2019 than the French in expressing complaint, but the findings recorded\nin Table 5 demonstrate that the degree of difference between the total number of\nintensifiers for the 5 highest and 5 lowest informants in each cohort was much\ngreater. Thus whatever general differences may have existed between French and\nEnglish assistants and the contexts in which they worked, personality was a far\ngreater factor than culture in determining the extent to which students complained\nand the intensity with which they did so.\n5 conclus ions\nWe have sought to argue in this paper that the analysis of complaint as a feature\nof intercultural pragmatics can usefully be extended to include indirect complaint.\nOur aim has been to compare the linguistic responses of two national groups of\ninformants to a set of culturally equivalent situations. Our analysis has revealed that\nidentifiable differences in the incidence and severity of complaint emerge between\nthe sample groups. The data as read showed that English informants complained\nconsiderably more than their French peers, did so with greater intensity and, at\nthe bottom end of the scale at least, qualified the expression of complaint less.\nHowever, within each sample, individual personality was a far greater determinant\nof volumes and intensity of complaint than cultural difference.\nWhile it would be invalid to draw wider conclusions from such a statistically\nlimited sample, the sharp differences revealed by the data raise questions which\ndeserve to be further addressed. As we have argued elsewhere (Crawshaw and\nHarrison, 2007), although motivated by similar concerns, complaints on the part of\nlanguage teaching assistants in France and England arise in response to institutional\npractices which are culturally and politically specific in origin. This paper shows\nfurther that the volume, mode and intensity of expression are also significantly\ndifferent. Given that this was the first experiment of its kind, our approach should\nbe applied in different contexts to other groups of language assistants before making\nwider cultural generalisations. However, when considering the validity of these\nfindings, it should be noted that the sample groups were self-selecting and formally\nidentified as \u2018agreeable, \u2019conscientious\u2019 and \u2018open\u2019. Were the same experiment to\nbe conducted on a national scale, the cultural implications of the findings might\nwell be more extreme.\nAddress for correspondence:\nRobert Crawshaw\nDepartment of European Languages and Cultures\nLancaster University\nLancashire, LA1 4YN\nUK\nr.crawshaw@lancs.ac.uk\n85\nRobert Crawshaw, Jonathan Culpeper and Julia Harrison\nre ference s\nBoxer, D.
