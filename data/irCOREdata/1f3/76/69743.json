INTRODUCTION \nWhether its operators, device manufactures, or the end \nusers, everyone agrees on the requirement for novel \napplications for mobile systems. Carriers are facing a decline \nin Average Revenues per User due to strong competition in \ntheir revenue stream which is extensively based on voice, \nSMS and more recently MMS. New ways to increase \nrevenue have included introduction of new portals offering \ncontent on mobile devices such as GPRS in Europe and i-\nmode in Japan which have met with varying degree of \nsuccess. A drawback of offering content on mobile phones is \nthat operators have to obtain a regular supply of this content \nwhich means either entering a whole new business field or \nrequires partnerships with content providers.  IT providers \nlike Google, MSN and Skype etc already provide rich \ncommunication mixing such services as email, chat, voice \nand video calls which has proven to be very successful on \nbroadband wired networks through Session Initiation \nProtocol (SIP). Rich real time communication mixing will be \nthe next big step for mobile operators in search for new \nrevenue streams. Porting of these mixed communication \nsessions to mobile networks could transform mobile carriers \nfrom their traditional role as IP telco providers in to that of \nIP pipe providers. The IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) \nenables carriers to offer these rich communication sessions \nand retain control over them by using SIP as backbone of the \nsystem.  \nMobile entertainment applications are not just an \nO.

Edwards is with the Department of Communication Systems, \nLancaster University, Lancaster UK (e-mail: r.edwards@lancaster.ac.uk). \nadditional revenue generating service, operators and content \nproviders are looking at mobile entertainment applications to \ngenerate increased revenue across the user base. Mobile Java \napplications dominate the market due to their platform \nindependent nature. Introduction of IMS holds a great \nbenefit for network operators, infrastructure vendors, device \nmanufactures and content providers. This paper looks into \nhow mobile Java applications can benefit from IMS. \nSection two gives a brief overview of SIP which is \nessential to understand the workings of IMS discussed later \nin section 3. However, we will not go into technical details \nof the individual components of IMS but rather give a brief \noverview of how it improves upon the existing systems. \nSection 4 looks at Java support available to application \ndevelopers for SIP and IMS. Having considered IMS and \navailable development support for mobile applications we \nshall see how these factors will contribute to the evolution of \nmobile entertainment applications in section 5. Finally in \nsection 6 we draw our conclusions as to whether SIP enabled \nmobile applications alone will be enough or utilizing IMS \nservices will bring significant benefits to the mobile \nindustry. \nII. OVERVIEW OF SIP \nSIP is a signaling protocol for multimedia conferencing \nover IP. It is an application layer protocol that can be used to \nestablish, maintain and terminate sessions between two or \nmore user agents.  SIP is a simple protocol based upon a \nrequest-response model using text based messages making it \neasier for developers to handle. It is not only the simplicity \nthat gives SIP an edge over other signaling protocols but the \nextensible nature that allows it to set up sessions for any \nmedia type, from voice to video, and application sharing. \nSIP is similar in nature to HTTP and other internet standards \nfrom Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). SIP itself is \nflexible; allowing developers to access individual protocol \nmessages which means that developers can create superior \napplication on top of SIP. It is due to these facts that IMS \nhas chosen SIP as its signaling protocol.  \nSIP can be considered as a new age version of CB radios \nand the similarity can bee seen in the structure of the SIP \ncall itself.  \nImplications of IMS and SIP on the Evolution of \nMobile Applications\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: IEEE Xplore.

Restrictions apply.\nFigure 1: Structure of a SIP Call \nSIP can be used to determine the location of the end \nsystem to route calls or even determine the capabilities of \nthe user device for media calls through Session Description \nProtocol (SDP). There are a wide range of applications that \ncan be offered over SIP such as VoIP, videoconferencing, \ninstant messaging, user registrations or user status, presence, \npush to talk over cellular (poc), business solutions and even \nnetworked games. Through SIP service providers can \ncustomize and deliver a range of SIP services that can \nprovide conferencing, presence, IM and media through one \nsession alone. Service providers can thus create a one \nflexible application rather than supporting multiple \nstovepipe applications. This lowers the cost of designing and \ndeployment for developers and end users can enjoy \nenhanced services.  \nIII. IMS OVERVIEW\nIMS is an architecture that in essence defines how IP \nnetworks should handle voice and data sessions by replacing \ncircuit switched telecommunications. It is a service oriented \narchitecture and employs a distributed component model for \nthe applications running on top of it. This means that it aims \nto separate the services from the underlying networks that \ncarry them. It originated from the Third Generation \nPartnership Project (3GPP) [1] as means of providing 3G \nmobile operators migrating from the Global System for \nMobile Communication (GSM) to deliver more effective \ndata services. Since then it has been adopted by other \nstandards organizations for both wire and wireless networks. \nWith SIP as the backbone of the system it is widely gaining \nbacking from services providers, vendors, application \ndevelopers and infrastructure vendors.  \nThe architecture of IMS consists of three layers namely \nthe transport layer, the control layer and the application layer \nas shown in figure 2. \nFigure 2. IMS: Simplified Structure \nSince IMS can separate the services from the underlying \ncarrier, a GPRS enabled mobile phone can connect to IMS \nequally as well as a PC connected via a Digital Subscriber \nLine (DSL). More importantly in a mobile environment, \nwhere a user has ability to roam, the access independence of \nIMS can not only allow both the physical roaming of the \nuser but also provide the ability for his\/her device to roam \nbetween various connection methods.  For example WiFi \nenabled mobile phones could seamlessly switch between \nusing GPRS or WiFi and users could even switch from using \ntheir handset to PC with the same session and as the same \nuser. Figure 2 illustrates that user data e.g. voice streaming \netc. is maintained within the transport layer and only \nsignaling information is sent to the upper layers through SIP. \nThe media server is controlled by application layer but \nresides within the transport layer. Both of these features \nensure that the upper layers are saved from large amounts of \ndata traffic.  \nThe control layer comprises of three components;  \n\u2022 The IMS Session Control function is \nresponsible for authentication and registration \nof the user on the network. Since IMS uses SIP \nfor signaling there is no need to know the \ndestination IP address as Global SIP URI can be \nused to contact the destination. The session \ncontrol function is the first port of call for a user \nwhen they attempt to connect to the network \nsince SIP URI and IP bindings are also \nmaintained by the same function.  \n\u2022 The user data profile maintains a set of \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: IEEE Xplore. Downloaded on January 7, 2009 at 04:00 from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply.\npreferences and data used by the session control \nfunction to authenticate and connect the user to \nrelevant Application Server (AS). In turn the \nAS uses the data profile to maintain a list of \nsettings or preferences for each user which \ngives the user a sense of consistency across \ndifferent devices.  \n\u2022 Media control acts as an interface between \napplication server and media server located in \nthe application layer and transport layer \nrespectively.  \nThe application layer, as the name suggests, is responsible \nfor providing both telephony and data services.  Network \nproviders can use any number of servers to provide these \nservices. Some generic servers, often referred to as service \nenablers, providing presence or group management data are \nalso components and their services can be made available to \nany other application server.  \nThe traditional or existing network structure requires \nunique functionality for charging, presence, group list \nmanagement and routing which can be very costly and \ndifficult to maintain. In other words separate \nimplementations for all layers must be built for every service \nin a traditional network. IMS allows reuse of many functions \nthat are generic in nature and can be used by virtually all \nservices. This is because the layered architecture in IMS is \nhorizontal which allows service enablers and other common \nfunctions to be reused by multiple functions. This also \nprovides roaming, charging, security and interoperability. \nThis horizontal architecture allows IMS operators to avoid \ntraditional vertical \u201cstove pipe\u201d implementations as shown in \nfigure 3 [2]. \nFigure 3. Traditional Stove Pipe Implementation compared to IMS \nHorizontal Layered Architecture \nIMS is a platform for creating and delivering a wide range \nof services. It is only responsible for connection, state \nmanagement, QoS and mobility while the actual data transfer \ntakes place directly amongst devices.

P2P Mobile Services with IMS \nIV. JAVA SUPPORT FOR SIP AND IMS \nThere are four Java Specification Requests (JSRs) for SIP \ntargeting three different Java platforms. These SIP JSRs are: \nA. JAIN SIP:  \nIt is targeted at Java 2 Standard Edition (J2SE) and \nenables the development of standalone user agent, proxy and \nuser registrar applications. Extensible by nature it provides \nstandardized interfaces that can be used to provide minimum \nSIP support in applications [3].   \nB. SIP Lite: \nSIP Lite can be implemented both on J2SE and J2ME \nplatform and provides an application environment for \ndevelopers who are not SIP literate. Originally developed for \nJ2SE the specification is so small that it can be implemented \non J2ME platform. It is suitable for midsize devices with \nrelatively more memory and processing power than mobile \ndevices e.g. SIP enabled phones [4]. \nC. SIP Servlet \nAs the name suggests this API is defined for execution on \nnetwork based SIP applications and is implemented on \napplication servers supporting SIP with an option to support \nHTTP and J2EE [5].  \nD. SIP for J2ME \nThis specification defines a J2ME optional package that \nenables SIP support for limited resource mobile devices. It is \nthe standardized SIP interface for mobile handsets with core \nnetwork functionality. Although it is specifically designed \nfor Connected Limited Device Configuration profile \n(CLDC) it can also be used with Connection Device \nConfiguration (CDC) profile. Client devices have to support \nSIP for Rel. 5.0 of the UMTS architecture. The API is \nintegrated with the Generic Connection Framework (GCF) \nof J2ME which keeps the look and feel of the HTTP API. \n[6].  \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: IEEE Xplore.

IMS Services API \nJSR 281 [7] is intended to enable application developers \nto create applications that utilize IMS services. IMS \nfunctionality is made available to developers through high \nlevel API\u2019s in an integrated fashion which hides the IMS \nimplementation details from the developers. This abstract \napproach of the specification not only hides the underlying \ntechnology but also provides application developers with the \nflexibility to harness the power of IMS. The specification \nprovides access to high level IMS functionality, Push to talk \nover Cellular (PoC) and Group List Management (GLM) \nservices.  \nIMS high level functionality covered by this API includes; \n\u2022 Support for IMS registration \n\u2022 Support for co-location of multiple of IMS services\n\u2022 Use of IMS service sessions (based on SIP \nsessions) \n\u2022 Presence and Group List Management \n\u2022 Use of media connections \nAlthough network architectures are unique to each service \nprovider however Sun [8] predicts the following end to end \narchitecture which shows how Java SIP specification maps \nonto IMS as defined by 3GPP.  \nFigure 6: IMS and Java SIP Mapping \nIt is not essential for the IMS AS to be J2EE AS, it can be \nany other AS connecting to the ISC interface. \nV. EVOLUTION OF MOBILE APPLICATIONS\nBusiness models in First generation (1G) mobile \nnetworks revolved around wireless voice communication \nbased upon Circuit Switched technology whilst second \ngeneration (2G) mobile system also known as Global \nSystem for Mobile (GSM) included Short Messaging \nService (SMS) as part of its signalling system. Mobile \napplications were mainly single player games or utility \napplications which were limited by handset capabilities \nand came bundled with the phone itself. The emergence of \nGeneral Packet Radio Services (GPRS) saw the \nintroduction of a cut down version of Java (J2ME) for \nphones. This was the first open development platform for \nmobile applications and with the always on capability of \nGPRS a range of networked mobile applications emerged. \nThe increasing functionality and capabilities of handsets \ntriggered a genre of mobile applications that drove the \nmarket forward.  Current mobile games and application \ncan take advantage of 3D graphics, location data, \nBluetooth and RFID etc.  \nKeeping in mind the services offered by IMS as \ndiscussed in section three, there are three prominent \nadvantages that future mobile applications will benefit \nfrom; \n\u2022 Rich media sessions \n\u2022 Flexible business models based upon per \nsession or per content charging \n\u2022 Enhanced connectivity through SIP \nIn order to view these differences we will consider a novel \nnetworked application which delivers live football updates \nto mobile phones using GPRS [9]. The application \nperiodically connects to a backend server to receive live \nupdates for that days football matches. A contrast is shown \nin figure 7 in terms of application user interface as seen on \nfirst generation mobile Java (J2ME MIDP 1.0) as compared \nto J2ME MIDP 2.0 platform running over Symbian OS. \nFigure 7: mfooty: A Networked J2ME Application \nConnection\nInputConnectio OutputConnectioSipConnectio DatagramConnectio\nStreamConnectio\nContentConnectio\nHttpConnectio\nSipConnectio\nn\nSipClientConnecti\nSipServerConnecti\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: IEEE Xplore.

Restrictions apply.\nWe shall not go into details about the improvements \nMIDP2.0 offers over MIDP 1.0 but instead we shall focus \non certain connectivity features that will provide added \nbenefits if this particular application was to utilize SIP and \nIMS. Currently the application provides text based updates \nto the users. In order to provide a video highlight the user \nhas to initiate a request to a licensed content provider or the \napplication can make periodic checks to see the availability \nof a video for a particular update e.g. a goal from a \nparticular game. Either way the request has to be made by \nthe UE to download the video. If the application was using \nSIP this information could be pushed to UE. Depending \nupon the user preferences this push can be an alert notifying \nthe user about the availability of content or the content itself.  \nAnother benefit that applications will have is different \ncost model. At the moment GPRS is charged by the amount \nof data transferred but with IMS users can have a choice \nfrom different charging plans such as to subscribe for one \nsession, pay by each update, or buy a season subscription. \nAlthough the application uses a unique protocol to transfer \nthe data over GPRS keeping the resulting cost to a minimum \n[10] yet it has to make periodic connection to the server to \ncheck if new updates are available. Given the nature of the \napplication the GPRS connection has to be suspended until \nthe next match starts. SIP will provide an added benefit in \nthis scenario where a SIP message can be used to resume the \nGPRS connection. Without SIP this would have to be done \nthrough a push message or setting up timers within the \napplication. The later option can only be possible on newer \nmobile phone OS such as Symbian which allow the \napplications to run in the background.  \nA major benefit of mobile applications running on \nterminals able to operate in an IMS powered network is the \nability to have rich sessions. A user can start an instant \nmessaging session with another mfooty user whilst receiving \nlive updates from football games or perhaps share a video \nwith another user. Figure 8 shows possible media sessions \nwhilst receiving live updates from mfooty Application \nServer.  \nFigure 8: Rich Sessions within IMS Network \nAs the above figure shows the users can enjoy a range of \nservices without terminating the previous. For example a \nuser receiving live updates from mfooty application server \ncan choose to start an instant chat session with one of the \ncontacts whose presence is set to home or can decide to send \na video his online contacts which he just recorded at a live \ngame etc. Whilst figure 8 shows the range of possible \nservices through IMS figure 9 shows how the application \nunder view has evolved in terms of service interaction and \nservice integration. This evolution can be predicated and \nseen in other application present in market today. \nSe\nrv\nice\n In\nte\ngr\nat\nio\nn\nFigure 9: Service Interaction across Different Mobile Java Profiles\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\nIMS appeals to every sector of mobile industry including \nnetwork operators, infrastructure vendors, users, enterprises \nand even application developers as IMS has got some \nexciting new services or functionality to offer. Mobile \nentertainment applications represent a significant revenue \ngeneration potential for mobile operators, content providers \nand even device manufacturers. Although information access \nwhilst on the move is the driving force for every single \nmobile application or games but economic factors and user \nexperience are equally important infact it\u2019s the later two that \nwill increase the consumer acceptance and network revenue \nfrom mobile entertainment applications. IMS not only \nprovides the foundation and necessary means to meet the \nrequirements of different sectors but also to realize and \nachieve the significant revenue from mobile applications.  \nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors wish to acknowledge the support of Nokia for \nthe real-time hardware and software laboratory in InfoLab21 \nat Lancaster University where much of this work was carried \nout. \nREFERENCES\n[1] 3GPP, www.3gpp.org\/. \n[2] J.
