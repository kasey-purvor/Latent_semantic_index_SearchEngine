In seeking to understand how to conceptualise this alternative, an\nanalysis of the organizational and political institutional contexts for leadership is provided.\nDesign\/methodology\/approach \u2013 Analyses the main precepts of democracy to establish the basis\nupon which a comparison between these two contexts might be made. It distinguishes between the\nvalue premises of democracy and the structural mechanisms through which those principles are\nenacted and identifies the significant leadership processes that underpin these values. This analysis is\nthen used as a basis for analyzing the leadership role in organizations.\nFindings \u2013 The paper demonstrates that differences between the two settings are a matter of\nperspective: the structural mechanisms of democracy are not enacted rationally. In particular, the\npre-eminence of micro-political activity is highlighted as a vehicle for the enactment of ethical\nbehaviour and civic virtue in both settings.\nPractical implications \u2013 Applying a political institutional approach to leading suggests the need to\nreconfigure the role of hierarchy to encourage self-organization, valuing conflict, protection of weaker\nstakeholders, the legitimization of political activity and helping groups to forge their own identity.\nOriginality\/value \u2013 Most similar analyses are typically constructed within the canons of rational\norganization. Applying to businesses the principles of institutional leadership implies a significantly\ndifferent model in which leaders promote and legitimise both the distribution and coalescing of power\nand the necessary dissent and debate required to reconcile a plurality of interests with the\nestablishment of organizational coherence.\nKeywords Democracy, Leadership, Politics, Stakeholder analysis\nPaper type Conceptual paper\nThe increasing tendency to see businesses as communities of stakeholders may not yet\nbe a mainstream idea, but it is increasingly hard to ignore. Some argue that the\npluralist nature of all organizations is now irrefutable (Etzioni, 1998; Child, 2005).\nBusiness leaders have to be responsive to the external interests of shareholders,\ncustomers, supply chain relationships and strategic alliances, as well as to the internal\nconcerns of employees seeking greater \u201cvoice\u201d and consultation. This multiple interest\nperspective has served to promote the development of stakeholder theory in which\nbusiness success is seen to lie in the capability of organizations to effectively work\nwith, and accommodate, such diverse concerns (Clarkson, 1995; Donaldson, 1999;\nJones, 1999). The participation of such stakeholders in organizational governance\nsuggests a more democratic orientation to organizing (Harrison and Freeman, 2004).\nYet progress towards this goal has been limited (Heller, 1998; Kerr, 2004). In\nparticular, attempts to extend participation in the workplace through strategies of\nThe current issue and full text archive of this journal is available at\nwww.emeraldinsight.com\/0025-1747.htm\nPolitical\nleadership in\ndemocracies\n985\nReceived January 2006\nRevised April 2006\nAccepted May 2006\nManagement Decision\nVol. 44 No. 8, 2006\npp. 985-1001\nq Emerald Group Publishing Limited\n0025-1747\nDOI 10.1108\/00251740610690577\nempowerment and culture management have tended to reinforce a unitary approach to\norganization (Brunson, 2002). Despite advocacy of so-called \u201cbottom up\u201d approaches to\nchange and involvement (Hamel, 2000; Lipman-Blumen and Leavitt, 2001), it appears\nthat business leaders have yet to see a meaningful alternative to rational bureaucracy\nas a way of providing organizational direction, coherence and efficiency (Child and\nMcGrath, 2001).\nNevertheless, there is an evident rationale for developing an alternative model of\norganizing. The need to work effectively with the complexity of stakeholder demands\nwill only increase (Daboub, 2002), resulting in a substantial disjunction with the\nnormative model of rational organization (Grint, 2004; Cludts, 1999). On the\nassumption that senior managers eventually have no choice but to address this schism\nbetween prescription and practice more fundamentally than hitherto, the central issue\nbecomes one of enabling them to rethink their role in relation to the stakeholder\ncommunities over which they preside\nIn seeking to understand how to conceptualise leadership in a democratically\nconstituted business context, this paper focuses on an obvious yet curiously\nunder-explored starting point. Can political leadership in democratic systems provide a\nlegitimate and credible template for business leaders, and to what extent can the\nprinciples underlying such leadership be translated into a business context (Peele,\n2005)? Our focus on the role of leadership is premised on the view that \u201cit is impossible\nto imagine a strong healthy democracy without leaders\u201d (Ruscio, 2004, p. ix). Whilst to\nbe effective, organizational democracy must reflect processes for participation, good\ncitizenship behaviour and other tenets of political institutions, democratic governance\nis justified in terms of people exercising influence over their collective destiny, and\nleadership is implicit in this endeavour (Ruscio, 2004).\nAt face value, the differences between business organizations and democratic\ninstitutions appear irreconcilable. Indeed, Armbruster and Gebert (2002) point to\nfundamental distinctions between organizations (of any constitution) and society.\nOrganizations usually have stated goals; society does not. Individuals are\ncontractually bound to organizations whereas they are members [their emphasis] of\nsociety without a voluntary contract. And crucially, as Etzioni (1998) points out, the\nelectorate has a right to participate, whereas employees usually have this privilege\nbestowed on them by senior managers. Thus, unsurprisingly, Peters and Williams\n(2002) see the most distinguishing feature of political leadership in democratic systems\nbeing the autonomy of representatives, and their link to external forces via the electoral\nconnection. Kerr (2004, p. 82) supports this view and is highly critical of \u201cthe\nassumption that, as a method of governance and decision making, democratic values\nand practices can be applied in all organization settings\u201d.\nIn this paper we seek to go beyond these evident objections. Like Harrison and\nFreeman (2004), we see greater organization democracy, not as a process of extending\nvoting power to stakeholders, but as a vehicle for enhancing self government and\nvoluntary association. In this context, we define organization democracy in terms of\nthe need for enhanced individual autonomy and the legitimisation of processes that\nenable such individuals to be self reflective \u2013 to deliberate, judge, choose and act upon\ncourses of action (Held, 1987) as free as possible from unequal power relationships. We\nwill distinguish between these value premises of democracy and the structural\nmechanisms through which they are enacted, arguing that whilst the former have\nMD\n44,8\n986\nincreasing relevance to the business organization context, it is the latter that strike\nsuch a discordant note when considered within that context. However, we will seek to\ndemonstrate that this difference between structure and values is a matter of\nperspective, since from a post-modern critical standpoint, the structural mechanisms of\ndemocracy are not enacted rationally, that is they are distorted by many competing\ninterests. The paper thus offers an initial analysis of the main precepts of democracy to\nestablish the basis upon which a comparison between institutions of democratic\ngovernment and the business context might be made. Conclusions are drawn as to the\ndifferences and similarities between each context, and the implications for business\nleadership are considered. It is not our intention here to provide a definitive model of\neither political or business leadership, nor to suggest that political leadership might\nmirror all aspects of business leadership. Rather, we seek to demonstrate that there are\naspects of political leadership that have significance for the management of\ncontemporary organizations. In doing so we hope to establish the value of further\ntheoretical and practical development.\nIn an undertaking of this breadth we have had to be selective in our focus. We\nignore the broad theoretical difficulties that are widely acknowledged to remain\nregarding the nature or role of leadership as a generic concept (see, for example, Elgie,\n1995; Barker, 1997; Grint, 2002), despite decades of research. Likewise, we do no more\nhere than to note that the nature of democracy has been the source of fundamental\ndebate (see, for example, Held, 1987; Lijphart, 1984) for rather longer still. Following a\ntheoretical position well established by others, we take a socially constructed approach\nto leadership (Elgie, 1995; Barker, 1997; Leach and Wilson, 2000; Denis et al., 2001).\nLeadership is seen as a phenomenon in which context and action mutually influence\neach other over time, with individual action being constrained by context and yet\nsimultaneously modifying that context (Giddens, 1984). We also conform to the widely\nheld assumption that leadership essentially involves the exercise of power in the\npursuit of a direction that is meaningful for others to follow (Leach and Wilson, 2000;\nHorner-Long and Schoenberg, 2002).\nDemocracy and its enactment\nAlthough there are many different conceptions of democracy (Lijphart, 1984; Held,\n1987; March and Olsen, 1995; Kaiser et al., 2002), and its enactment differs across\ncultures (Kim et al., 2002), time (Skowronek, 1993) and regimes (Wildavsky, 1989; John\nand Cole, 1999), at the heart of the democratic ideal lies the notion of equal freedom for\nall to deliberate the aims of society. We find there is broad agreement within the extant\nliterature that the value premises (Starrat, 2001) underpinning this ideal embrace,\nabove all, the following:\n. Individual and group autonomy \u2013 the central principle of classical democracy is\nliberty (Held, 1987) \u2013 people living together as equals under the law yet, free to\npursue their own interests (Starrat, 2001). From this viewpoint, democracy is\nintended to realise the desire of individuals for meaningful control over their\nlives (Patten, 2001; Held, 1987; Lijphart, 1984).\n. Acceptance of competing interests \u2013 as a consequence of the desire for individual\nautonomy, conflict and competition for scarce resources is also central to the\nenactment of democracy. \u201cCompetitive politics gives power to the people\u201d (Barry,\n2002, p. 157) and thus to talk about democracy is to talk about a system of\nPolitical\nleadership in\ndemocracies\n987\ncompeting interests (Robertson, 1976). Far from being divisive, this competition\npreserves the ideal of democracy by ensuring the necessary checks and balances\nagainst abuse of power (Mu\u00a8ller and Str\u00f8m, 1999).\n. Reasoned consideration of alternatives \u2013 if a democratic society is thus one that\nacknowledges the inevitability of diversity of opinion (Patten, 2001), the stronger\nthe degree of factionalism, the greater the need for institutional structures that\nencourage participation (Robertson, 1976; Held, 1987). Explicitly partisan debate\nand resultant transparency of information is therefore an integral and legitimate\npart of the democratic process, and essential for the resolution of differences\n(Stuckey, 1999; Nice, 1998).\nWe also find there to be broad agreement in the literature that democratic systems\nrequire three particular structural mechanisms to ensure the enactment of these value\npremises:\n(1) Representation \u2013 a process that mediates between potential tyranny and\nanarchy. Achieving the balance between rule by an elite and indirect rule\nthrough the masses appears for many commentators central to ensuring\ndemocratic debate (Barbrook, 1975).\n(2) Accountability \u2013 the ability of an electorate to \u201cpunish\u201d or \u201creward\u201d leaders\nthrough elections. Thus although the people do not rule, they have power over\nthe rulers and thus indirectly have power to determine the content of the\ndecisions taken by the rulers (Barry, 2002).\n(3) Participation \u2013 the process through which the electorate\u2019s views are taken into\naccount (Kaiser et al., 2002). Kim et al. (2002) suggest that the degree of electoral\ninclusion has a direct impact on the level to which the electorate trust their\npolitical representatives to deliver on their mandate.\nAlthough the value premises underpinning democracy ultimately remain the subject of\na discussion already of several millennia duration, much contemporary debate focuses\non whether structural mechanisms for the enactment of democracy have empirical\nvalidity. The conclusions reached are very much dependent on the epistemological\nperspective in use, for as Patten (2001, p. 223) points out, \u201cdemocracy is always a\nmatter of degree\u201d. Jones (1989) draws a distinction between traditional, rational\napproaches to political science and those that take a post-modern, critical perspective.\nFrom the latter vantage point, the mechanisms of representation, accountability and\nparticipation are not enacted rationally. Let us consider this further.\nRepresentation does not provide a direct and actionable link with the electorate\n(Mu\u00a8ller and Str\u00f8m, 1999). Representatives are caught between party, constitutional and\nindividual interests and thus in reality politicians experience a range influences that\nmediate their representational role. These include; allocating party finances, the impact\nof electoral institutions, the need to attract votes, the numbers of parties in competition,\ntheir party\u2019s own organization, and the incentives for party leaders when in office.\nMu\u00a8ller and Str\u00f8m\u2019s (1999, p. 307) research suggests that while political leaders are\nmore responsive to the electorate than to their membership, they are \u201cfar from playing\nthe role prescribed for political parties by democratic theory\u201d. Campbell and Rockman\n(1999) suggest that that the quality of representation is as much to do with the aptitude\nMD\n44,8\n988\nfor independent judgement and self-reliance in the electorate as it is to do with the\nlinkage between representatives and voters.\nSimilar issues arise with participation. Stuckey (1999) sees accountability as\nbeing composed of political (electoral) and institutional (constitutional) processes.\nShe points out that political accountability is an unreliable mechanism at best\nbecause elections are becoming more and more subject to media influence, and the\ndistinctions between governing and campaigning becoming more blurred. Barry\n(2002) suggests that accountability is at best a by-product of prospective voting,\nsince whatever power voters have over a government comes about by virtue of\nthat government\u2019s expectations of how its performance will affect its chances of\nsuccess at the next election. The only way voters can make a reasoned decision is\nby assessing whether the opposition would have done worse or better- a\nhypothetical and a complex estimation subject to all kinds of influences that\nweaken the process of accountability. Similarly, political accountability is also\nargued to be diminished. In the UK this is reflected in the disenfranchisement of\nNew Labour party members (Kennedy and Joseph, 2000), and in the USA by a\nweakening party political system and a Congress that has fallen prey to scandal\nmongering (Stuckey, 1999).\nInclusion of the electorate\u2019s views is similarly mediated by a number of factors.\nPolicy decisions may not reflect electoral preferences for many reasons: tactical and\nstrategic decisions by politicians, self-interested behaviour, context changes,\ncompromises and broken promises (Kaiser et al., 2002, Preston and t\u2019Hart, 1999).\nThe electoral system, too, may impair this process. For example, in \u201cfirst past the post\u201d\nsystems, the winning party may not enjoy genuinely wide support, as evidenced in the\nUK by New Labour\u2019s 2001 re-election. Again, when politicians are required to vote in\naccordance with party executive policy, \u201cat the limit, democracy can mask rule by a\nsmall elite or even an elected dictator\u201d (Nagel cited in Kaiser et al., 2002).\nThus, from a post-modern perspective, the mechanisms for accomplishing in\npractice the value premises of democracy are not rationally enacted. According to\nStarrat (2001, p. 347), \u201cthe post modern critique of modernity has illuminated the logic\nof power and the mythic assumptions behind the practise and the theory of\ndemocracy\u201d. However, far from rejecting the concept of democracy as a practical form\nof governance, Starrat (2001, p. 351) argues that the \u201cfulfilment of working towards a\ndemocratic community is worth the struggle of its imperfect realization\u201d. As a case in\npoint, following the 2001 UK parliamentary election, when less than half of the possible\nvotes were cast, new processes of representation (for example, increasing the use of\nplebiscitary referenda, telephone and internet voting, more local mayoral offices) are\nbeing tested. Such actions can be seen as a reflection of the deeper underlying value\npremises that over time, through careful stewardship by institutional leaders, become\ntranslated into the processes of government, always with the aim of minimising any\ncompromise of their integrity. Thus, it is the value premises of individual and group\nautonomy, acceptance of competing interests, and reasoned consideration of\nalternatives, that we will argue to provide the basis for valid comparison of the\nprocess of leadership in political and corporate contexts. Moreover, as we will seek to\ndemonstrate, whilst the structural mechanisms of representation, accountability and\nparticipation provide the template for enacting democratic value premises, the\nprocesses in use are better guide to enactment practices within context of political\nPolitical\nleadership in\ndemocracies\n989\ninstitutions. Crucially, it is these that appear to correlate with processes in use found in\nthe context of business organizations.\nDemocratic values and the practice of political leadership\nFrom a pan-historical viewpoint, the stewardship of these democratic values has\nbecome central to democratic government (Ruscio, 2004). Thus over time, societies\nhave enshrined them in roles, rules and procedures that provide the practical\nframeworks for representation, participation and accountability. Presidencies, prime\nministerships, cabinets, advisory units, bureaucracies, legislatures, electoral systems,\ninterest groups and political parties all form part of this framework (Elgie, 1995). It is\ntherefore the interaction and application of these roles, rules and procedures that, for\npractical purposes, forms the context for political leadership (Elgie, 1995).\nIn this context, studies of political leadership have explored the impact of a wide\nvariety of influences such as style (Simonton, 1988), psychological disposition (Preston\nand t\u2019Hart, 1999) and in different settings such as party leadership (Mu\u00a8ller and Str\u00f8m,\n1999), lobbying (DeGregorio, 1997), local authority leadership (John and Cole, 1999),\nand public sector organizations (Vigoda, 2002). This work indicates that generic issues\nare recognisable across different democratic systems (Elgie, 1995), and therefore, that\nsimilar types of leadership behaviour are observable. Specifically, we postulate that in\nstewarding the value premises of democracy, the enactment of political leadership is\ncharacterised by the need to resolve two distinct sources of stress: firstly, between the\ndrive for cohesion and the productive exploitation of differences; secondly, between the\nexercise of bureaucratic politics and civic virtue, in which leaders balance personal\ninterests with those of wider concern. We would argue that the manner in which\nleaders address these tensions amounts to processes in use that are, in practice, the\nmechanisms through which democratic value premises are enacted. In other words, the\nmechanisms of representation, accountability and inclusion provide a formal\nexpression of what in actuality are elaborate organizational processes. These exist\nfor the very reason that the formal mechanisms can be neither rationally enacted nor\noptimally designed.\nLet us further examine these two tensions. The imperative for cohesion is evident in\nboth managing the support of interest groups external and internal to parliaments. The\nvoluntary nature of this support and participation is critical in the way leaders attempt\nto build their mandates. For example, in the context of UK local authorities, Leach and\nWilson (2000) consider that an ability to read the range of external and internal\nagendas in order to create cohesion is crucial to political leadership. Not only are vested\ninterests expected, but there is an anticipated difference between the degree of public\nand private support provided for different causes (ibid), and thus that some politicians\nmay well pursue a covert strategy. At party or electorate level, the use of rhetoric and\nmass media to build consensus, or stimulate change and exploit opportunities is also\nconsidered essential (Gaffney, 2001, Mazzoleni, 2000). The ability of leaders to\nmanipulate the portrayal of issues (whether through media management or personal\npresentation) is one of the most important ways of achieving this consensus (Peele,\n2005, Baumgartner, 1989).\nStudies of political leadership on both sides of the Atlantic therefore emphasise a\nmindset that sees conflict as a necessary and pervasive aspect of political life (Kaarbo\nand Hermann, 1998). Whilst differences can create schisms that may harden into\nMD\n44,8\n990\nintractable positions, they are also often seen as a healthy stimulus that can make a\npositive contribution (Leach and Wilson, 2000; Takala, 1998). In order to maintain\nenthusiasm amongst immediate followers, leaders need to be able to encourage\ndifferences but keep the ensuing tensions \u201cwithin bounds\u201d (Leach and Wilson, 2000).\nApproaches to managing this diversity in cabinet settings include developing\nrelationships with key factions, encouraging interdependence and empowerment\namongst cabinet colleagues, preparing the ground before meetings, and rewarding\nallies (Kaarbo and Hermann, 1998). In order to raise the support needed to pass\nlegislation, leaders must \u201ctrick, woo and cajole their way to a following\u201d (DeGregorio,\n1997, p. 2).\nThese observations on the tension between the drive for cohesion and the\nproductive exploitation of differences also serve to emphasise the pervasive existence\nof micro politics in the leadership process. Actors with mutual and competing interests\nare continually bargaining, coalition building, pulling and hauling. Whilst of course the\ncentrality of macro governmental politics is recognised as being critical to the\nenactment of democracy (Held, 1987), the ubiquitous nature of bureaupolitic is still only\na partially understood phenomenon in the policy making process (Preston and t\u2019Hart,\n1999). Such activity can of course be destructive (Nice, 1998), but is nevertheless\nendemic to leadership in a political context and a potentially valuable source of\npluralist checks and balances (Preston and t\u2019Hart, 1999)\nThe significance of micro political behaviour is that it gives rise to a second source\nof tension, since it can only be predicated on the assumption that political leaders\npossess \u201ccivic virtue\u201d (Starrat, 2001, p. 337), the ability to forego, at least on some\noccasions, self interest on behalf of others or on behalf a wider common good. For\nwithout civic virtue, democracy disintegrates (Renshon, 2000). If successful political\nleaders are those who are able to create cohesion from diversity, such leaders must\ndemonstrate their ability to balance self interested behaviour with broader policy\ngoals. Tightening political accountability cannot replace a sense of individual\nresponsibility in political leaders, and indeed to do so would only force politicians to\nresort to less legitimate forms of political behaviour (Stuckey, 1999). Balancing micro\npolitical activity with the representational role is therefore intrinsically important in\nachieving cohesion amongst partisan interests.\nThus whilst the enactment of political leadership is undoubtedly moderated by\nindividual differences in ambition and personal style, there are specific features\ndistinguishable across different democratic forms. The core democratic value premises\nof autonomy, acceptance of competing interests, and reasoned debate, are\ninstitutionalised into mechanisms that encourage the distribution and voluntary\ncoalescing of power, and that moderate the resultant tensions through participation\nand consultation. In practice this means that political leadership is generally\ncharacterised, firstly, by activity that values differences but seeks to create cohesion in\nsupport of policy, and secondly by micro political activity predicated upon the\nunderlying principle of civic virtue that values the representational and stewardship\nroles of political leadership. Indeed, in a political environment increasingly\ncharacterised by decentralisation, mass media, multiple stakeholders, bureaucratic\nreform and institutional fragmentation, the stewardship of collective, voluntary and\nparticipatory processes of decision making are likely to become ever more important\n(Leach and Wilson, 2000; Pillai and Williams, 1998).\nPolitical\nleadership in\ndemocracies\n991\nBusinesses as stakeholder communities\nIn what ways then does this understanding facilitate or preclude a comparison with\nemerging theories of stakeholder organizations? In principle, stakeholder theory\nexplains business survival in terms of an organizational capability to create sufficient\nwealth, value or satisfaction for parties with whom it has critical relationships\n(Clarkson, 1995;Donaldson, 1999; Friedman and Miles, 2002). This reflects the idea of\nsuccessful organizations being in a mutually adaptive relationship with their\nenvironment (Caldart and Ricart, 2004). This \u201cco evolution\u201d is the \u201cjoint outcome of\nmanagerial intentionality, environment and institutional effects\u201d (Lewin and Volberda,\n1999, p. 527). In this context, competitiveness is dependent upon the continual\nreconfiguration of corporate resources (Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000), the resulting\norganizational form being described in one study as a \u201cdynamic community\u201d, where the\ncapability to work in such ways are the result of a \u201csocial community\u201d bound together\nby a number of communal imperatives (Galunic and Eisenhardt, 2001, p. 1229).\nThis theme of organizations as communities of stakeholders is also prevalent in the\nCommunity of Practice literature that focuses on organizational learning (Lave and\nWenger, 1991; Brown and Duguid, 1991, 2001) and particularly in the work of Charles\nHandy (1997, 1998) that tracks the emergence of the concept of \u201corganizational\ncitizenship\u201d. Handy\u2019s idea reflects the voluntary basis upon which employees share\ntheir valuable knowledge; this has to be given freely and thus employees need to be\nviewed as voluntary citizens, not merely employees. Citizens pursue both individual\nand shared purposes, competing and relying on each other simultaneously. In a\nbusiness conceived of as a stakeholder community, strategic leadership is distributed\namong diverse individuals who share the responsibility to create a viable future for\ntheir firm (Ray et al., 2003; Frydman et al., 2000; Bennett et al., 2003).\nHowever, the extent of such change in the workplace is still a matter of debate\n(Etzioni, 1998; Halal, 2000; Thompson and Davidson, 1995). Stakeholder theorists, as\nJohn Hendry (2001, p. 223) points out, are challenged by the task of integrating the\nmoral and economic arguments of stakeholder theory. In consequence they \u201chave\neither restricted themselves to very modest claims as to the respect to be afforded to\nstakeholders within the existing legal and institutional structure, or, more commonly,\npitched their claims so high as to sacrifice any practical credibility\u201d. He suggests that\nmore progress might be made if stakeholder theory gives greater weight to the idea of\norganization as a complex system of social relationships in which the ethical and\neconomic conflicts of this approach can be understood as being resolved in the same\nway as the moral conflicts of individual managers facing the practical dilemmas of\neveryday life (ibid). Our focus on the social processes of political decision making takes\nup this challenge: in this paper, the importance of a stakeholder perspective lies in its\nemphasis on organizations as the locus for a plurality of interests (Cludts, 1999; Crane\net al., 2004). Our approach to stakeholder theory is one which explicitly highlights the\ncentral role of conflicting agendas; managers are thus continually engaged in a process\nof co-ordinating and weighing different claims in order to guarantee long-term\norganizational survival (Cludts, 1999; Cragg and Greenbaum, 2002).\nThus, viewed from a stakeholder perspective, the distribution of power in business\nsettings appears as diverse as in a political context. As many commentators observe, in\nan effort to be more responsive to stakeholder interests, businesses are attempting to\ndevolve power and responsibility for many more organizational decisions, leading to\nMD\n44,8\n992\nsmaller, self-organising units (see, for example, Miles et al., 1997; Child and McGrath,\n2001; Daboub, 2002). These interests are both internal and external, unpredictable and\nmulti directional (Lewin and Volberda, 1999). Complexity and co-evolutionary theorists\n(Galunic and Eisenhardt, 2001; Brown and Eisenhardt, 1997; Malnight, 2001) note how,\nin order to meet different stakeholder interests, businesses develop modular forms and\nthat these can build autonomy and diversity of power into organizational design. In a\nsimilar vein, Denis et al. (2001) have found that the formal prescribed structure in the\npluralistic setting of healthcare did not give dominant power to any one key\nconstituent, and that progress was made by constellations of leaders acting in concert.\nThus as is widely recognised, leadership power is derived from successful\nrelationships rather than hierarchical position (see, for example, Ray et al., 2003;\nBisset, 2004). This social capital is derived from a wide variety of networks and\ninterpersonal relationships (Burt, 1992; Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998; Bolino et al., 2002).\nIn dynamic co-evolving organizations, social capital is in a constant state of flux as\nrelationships and networks converge and collide.\nThere is not the scope here to draw further parallels between the features of\ndemocratically constituted political institutions and the stakeholder view of business\nentities. (Further analyses can be found in Rousseau and Rivero, 2003; and Kerr, 2004).\nHowever, from the forgoing discussion we contend that the value premises of\ndemocracy are self-evident within stakeholder theory. Whether the structural\nmechanisms for their enactment are applicable to leadership in a business context then\nbecomes our central question.\nSome lessons for business\nAs previously highlighted, there are clearly inherent limits to which representation,\naccountability and inclusion are appropriate to the business context. Despite the\nincreasing interest in stakeholder theory, the idea of business leaders representing the\ninterests of a constituency, other than that of shareholder, seems as yet embryonic\n(Cragg, 2000). Furthermore, insofar as the faithful representation of constituent\ninterests is apparent in business, accountablity is not subject to the same high degree\nof public scrutiny required of political leaders. Similarly, the inclusion of constituent\nviews in business decision making processes remains limited, despite significant and\nwidespread effort to introduce formal participatory mechanisms (Thompson and\nDavidson, 1995; Heller, 1998). And most fundamentally, whilst protecting the rights of\ndemocratic participation is an immutable aspect of political leadership, it is not\nreflected in a business context (Coopey and Burgoyne, 2000). The stewardship role of\nbusiness leaders has become institutionalised as a concern for organizational wealth\nand shareholder return, rather than democratic principles of governance (Cragg, 2000).\nHowever, we argue that these are mostly differences of degree rather than\nsubstance. Thus, on the one hand, political leaders within the institutions of democracy\nmake considerable use of formal authority in such roles as party officials or committee\nmembers. Political parties and the executive institutions of government are\norganizations with hierarchies, and formal authority has a role in enabling political\nleaders to create coherence. Yet such formal authority must be balanced fundamentally\nwith the legitimacy of representation and accountability for the inclusion of pluralist\nelectorate views. On the other hand, from a stakeholder theory perspective, the formal\nauthority of business leaders co-exists with their role as de facto representatives of\nPolitical\nleadership in\ndemocracies\n993\nconstituent interests. As organizations become more complex and fragmented, the role\nof informal power derived from relationships and networks across the organization\nincreases in importance (Atkinson and Butcher, 2003; Tsai and Ghoshal, 1998) and\nleadership thus becomes evermore the product of an informal social process (Barker,\n1997; Ray et al., 2003). The appointment of leaders to senior positions is therefore\ndependent upon representing the interests of a whole range of relationships, which if\nnot recognised can lead to political turnover (Denis et al., 2001, Comtois et al., 2004).\nBusiness leaders are therefore required to become representational in their approach, a\nprocess further reinforced by increasing public scrutiny of corporate affairs.\nAs it is for political leaders in democratic institutions, this requirement both to\ncoalesce and distribute power can only be achieved on the assumption that the\nleadership of organizations is intrinsically a micro-political process. Since there is\nample evidence that this is the case (Pfeffer, 1992; Barker, 1997; Coopey and Burgoyne,\n2000), it follows that business leaders need to, and indeed, appear to embrace\nbehaviours that not only include debate, lobbying and coalition building, but also more\ncontentious activity such as information management, covert action and an ability to\n\u201ctrick, woo and cajole support\u201d (DeGregorio, 1997, p. 2). In other words, if some level of\ncohesion around core organizational values is to be achieved, these behaviours need to\nbecome as integral to business leadership as open dialogue and debate about\ndifferences. As has increasingly been recognized (Pfeffer, 1992; Buchanan, 1999;\nVigoda, 2003), micro-political behaviour in organizations, far from being dysfunctional,\nis central to the achievement of managerial goals. Moreover, it may well constitute a\nvehicle to strengthen the social responsibility of managers (Grint, 2004).\nIn this respect, the negative connotation associated with \u201corganizational politics\u201d is\na residue of rational bureaucratic values and an impediment to effective management\nof the stakeholder organization. Commentators such as Coopey and Burgoyne(2000)\nargue that the legitimacy of political action may best be attained through statutory\nrights that guarantee participation in debate, freedom of speech and protection from\nillegal coercion. However, as Heller (1998) observes, over the last 50 years the many\nattempts to introduce greater levels of democracy into the workplace have met with\nlimited success, and formal participation in decision making can be slow and messy,\nleading to unwarranted levels of conflict (Duchon et al., 1998, cited in Ashmos et al.,\n2002). And as Stuckey (1999) highlights in the context of political institutions,\ntightening formal accountability may only force leaders to resort to less acceptable\nmeans of micro-political behaviour. As with the leadership of political institutions,\nresponsible micro-political behaviour can only be predicated on the assumption that\nbusiness leaders possess civic virtue. And to our knowledge, there is no evidence to\nsuggest that managers are any less motivated by just causes, any less willing to forego\nself-serving ends, nor any less prepared to distinguish between ethical and unethical\nmeans, than elected politicians (Michalos, 2001).\nPractical and theoretical implications\nIn recent years there has been a steady increase in literature that focus on the\nimportance of democracy as a feature of future organizational forms (for example,\nHesselbein et al., 1997; Cloke and Goldsmith, 2002; Manville and Ober, 2003). These\ncontributions routinely discuss principles of representational leadership, participation\nand organizational citizenship, but conceptually are typically constructed well within\nMD\n44,8\n994\nthe canons of rational organization. Thus they tend to assume unity of motive and open\ncommunication to be attainable organizing principles, and de facto the primary\ntemplate for business leadership.\nApplying to businesses the principles of leadership found within the institutions of\ndemocratic government implies a significantly different model to that reflected in the\nrational management of organizations. Whilst formal authority remains employed in\nthe pursuit of unity, it does not serve to ensure control. This principle promotes and\nlegitimises both the distribution and coalescing of power and the necessary dissent and\ndebate required to reconcile a plurality of interests with the establishment of\norganisational coherence. Common good can emerge \u201cfrom chaotic, reciprocal\ninteraction among people with potentially conflicting goals, values and ideals\u201d (Barker,\n1997, p. 351). Organisation leaders, like their institutional counterparts must in effect\ntake pride in defending what they seek to oppose (Sandel, cited in Etzioni, 1999), that is,\nto value opposition and difference. For in doing so they surface the debate and dialogue\nthat checks the abuse of power so often felt by less powerful stakeholders. Extending\nthe parallel with democratic governance, the leadership role would therefore also be to\nmediate between deserving causes, challenging constituents to justify the significance\nof their agendas and their demands for resource. The role of top management would\nremain to provide fundamental organizational framing, but that this would take into\nconsideration many voices, and by satisfactorily justifying their conclusions and\nactions to their constituents.\nOnly through the voluntary pursuit of individual and often competing agendas can\nindividuals negotiate their identification to wider organisational values. This may be\nbest achieved by leadership behaviours that encourage self-organisation, valuing\ncompetition and conflict, the protection of weaker groups and helping groups to create\ntheir own identity and ethics. This approach is premised on the idea that unofficially\nconstituted groups in organizational settings are able to provide the level of self-control\nnecessary for the maintenance of organizational congruence; a multiplicity of\nstakeholder agendas does not necessarily create organizational incoherence (Rowley\nand Moldoveanu, 2003; Caldart and Ricart, 2004).\nThis voluntaristic form of participation is predicated on leaders acknowledging\ntheir responsibility to act as stewards of constructive political activity, without which\nindividuals have no legitimate process of positioning causes and reconciling\ndifferences. Viewed in this way organizational politics are no longer an aberration to be\ntolerated but a \u201cdemocratic asset\u201d (Novicevic and Harvey, 2004) to be encouraged. The\nlegitimate use of politics is dependent upon leaders being able to demonstrate the\nethical content of their decisions by their ability to balance personal and organisational\ninterests (Butcher and Clarke, 2001) in the pursuit of causes that are worthy, from a\nsocial, as well as economic point of view (Galunic and Eisenhardt, 2001). As such,\nsenior managers will be actively embracing the role of community architect in which\nthe need for civic virtue (Starrat, 2001), the ability to balance individual interests with\nthose of the social and economic interests of the wider organisational community,\nbecomes central to leadership. In other words, they will need to aspire to become\nintimately concerned with how they represent the motivations and interests of\nindividuals and how these are voluntarily integrated into the mores of their wider\norganisational community (Barker, 1997; Courpasson and Dany, 2003).\nSo described, this is not intended as a closely articulated model of business\nleadership, nor as some radical agenda for its transformation. Our purpose here has\nPolitical\nleadership in\ndemocracies\n995\nbeen to draw attention to some parallels between the leadership task in the institutions\nof democracy and the problem for business leaders posed by the pluralism inherent in\nthe stakeholder organization. We argue that relevant lessons may be drawn from this\ncomparison, and that those lessons are significant on account of the need to provide\nbusiness executives with new insight into how they can better shape their\nstakeholder-driven organizations.\nThe extent to which these leadership behaviours are observable in organizations,\nand the nature of their motivational antecedents, now forms the basis of a research\nprogramme for the authors. Whilst further theoretical development is required, initial\nhypothesising suggests that four behaviour sets are central to a leadership approach\nwhich seeks to balance both diversity and cohesion of agenda and self interest and\ncivic virtue. These are:\n(1) Representing the interests of constituencies not immediately connected with a\nleader\u2019s own formal responsibilities \u2013 leaders who value diversity of view are\nhypothesised as being concerned to bring together a wide variety of\nconstituencies to pursue interests through collective action, thereby creating a\nsense of involvement (Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 2005).\n(2) In turn this requires leaders to provide such constituencies with space,\nautonomy and power to act and experiment (Yorks and Marsick, 2000).\n(3) In order to encourage cohesion, RL\u2019s need to facilitate debate and challenge.\nThis orientation is similar to the notion of an \u201carena\u201d (Burgoyne and Jackson,\n1997, p. 61) in which differences meet, are fought over, reconciled and\nreconfigured into new groupings factions and alliances.\n(4) In practice, this means that organizational politics, as with its counterpart in an\ninstitutional setting, is a necessary and logical process by which diverse\ninterests are resolved (Butcher and Clarke, 2001; Held, 1987). This includes\nbehaviours such as networking, positioning causes, lobbying, and coalition\nbuilding (Denis et al., 2001; Ammeter et al., 2002). These four behaviour sets are\nviewed as recursive, both shaped by, and shaping, social structures.\nAs yet, there exists no appropriate model of leadership consistent with a stakeholder\ntheory of businesses, nor are we alone in suggesting the need for one is increasingly\napparent (Rousseau and Rivero, 2003). As a contribution to the development of this\nmodel we have sought to argue here that there is some well-established precedent on\nwhich to draw.\nReferences\nAmmeter, A., Douglas, C., Gardner, W., Hochwater, W. and Ferris, G.
