B. DEANE\n(Communicated by Jane M. Hawkins)\nAbstract. We show that, given a \ufb01nite partition of the plane C such that\nthe map G acts as a linear contraction on each part, for almost every choice\nof parameters every orbit of G is (asymptotically) periodic.\n1. Introduction\nPiecewise isometries are a class of dynamical systems which exhibit complicated\nbehaviour without being chaotic in the classical sense; they have zero Lyapunov\nexponents, their topological entropy is zero [5], and they usually have islands of\nquasi-periodic motion. However, they also tend to have \u2018exceptional sets\u2019 on which\nthe dynamical behaviour is of a fascinating complexity. Two well-known examples\nof piecewise isometries are (i) the class of piecewise a\ufb03ne maps of the torus, stud-\nied for example in [1, 2, 6] and (ii) the \u2018Goetz map\u2019 [10]. The latter consists of\npiecewise rotations of the positive and negative half planes around di\ufb00erent centres\nof rotation. For angles satisfying speci\ufb01c number-theoretical properties, both \u2018toral\nmaps\u2019 and Goetz maps can be understood in terms of substitution shifts [1, 4, 12],\nbut otherwise the dynamics remain mostly not understood.\nPiecewise isometries, including those mentioned above, appear in many applica-\ntions, for instance, as descriptions of at least three electronic circuits [2, 6, 8], and\nalso in relation to impact oscillators, as \ufb01rst return maps of polygonal billiards and\nin queueing theory [13]. In two of the three electronic circuits alluded to, the (not\nrealistic) assumption of zero dissipation has been made; allowing nonzero dissipa-\ntion forces one to consider piecewise contractions instead of piecewise isometries,\nand it is this that motivates the present work.\nWhereas in piecewise isometries, the discontinuities are responsible for compli-\ncated behaviour, we show in this paper that for typical piecewise contractions, the\ncontracting behaviour dominates the complexity introduced by discontinuities, so\nthat we only see (asymptotic) periodic motion. This is illustrated by a \u2018contracting\nGoetz map\u2019 in Figure 1. When the Goetz map has a contraction factor \u03bb<1, we\nare left with only \ufb01nitely many preimages of pieces of the discontinuity line in a\n\ufb01nite area. In fact, for su\ufb03ciently small \u03bb, it has been shown in [9] that every point\nReceived by the editors December 12, 2007, and, in revised form, May 1, 2008.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classi\ufb01cation.

The rotation angle and contraction factor apply to both\npartitions. The centres of rotation, shown as stars, are w1 = \u22121+\n2i,w 2 = 1 and the left\/right-hand half planes are rotated about\nw2,w 1 respectively.\nis attracted to a single periodic orbit. The case of \u03bb<1 is to be contrasted with\nthe same mapping with \u03bb = 1, also shown in Figure 1.\nIn the present paper, we assume that {Xk}K\nk=1 is a \ufb01nite partition of C such that\nfor each k, G|Xk is an a\ufb03ne map contracting distances. By this we mean that G|Xk\nextends to an a\ufb03ne contraction on C with a \ufb01xed point wk \u2208 C. (Note that wk\nneed not belong to Xk.) Let w = {w1,...,w K}\u2208CK and \u03bb = {\u03bb1,...,\u03bb K}\u2208DK,\nwhere \u03bbk \u2208 D are contraction factors and D is the open unit disc in C.\nThus we arrive at a piecewise continuous map G : C \u2192 C de\ufb01ned as\n(1) G(z): =Gk(z)=\u03bbkz +( 1\u2212 \u03bbk)wk if z \u2208 Xk.\nLemma 1. There exists an R such that the disc BR = {|z|\u2264R} is forward\ninvariant, and for every z there is an n such that Gn(z) \u2208 BR.\nProof. Let \u03bbmax =m a x k |\u03bbk| and wmax =m a x k |wk|. Then it is straightforward to\nshow that taking R =2 wmax\/(1 \u2212 \u03bbmax) satis\ufb01es the lemma. \u0001\nLet S =\n\u0001\nk \u2202Xk \u2229 BR; by de\ufb01nition of the partition, S consists of \ufb01nitely\nmany curves, which we assume to be recti\ufb01able; i.e., they have \ufb01nite length (\ufb01nite\none-dimensional Hausdor\ufb00 measure). In what follows, it is unimportant how G is\nde\ufb01ned on S.\nThe exceptional set E is de\ufb01ned as\nEn =\n\u0002\n0\u2264i\u2264n\nG\u2212i(S) \u2229 BR and E =\n\u0002\nn\u22650\nEn.\nEach En consists of a \ufb01nite set of recti\ufb01able arcs.\nTheorem 2. For all \u03bb \u2208 DK and Lebesgue a.e. w \u2208 CK, there exists a \ufb01nite N\nsuch that E = EN.PIECEWISE CONTRACTIONS 1391\nCorollary 3. For all \u03bb \u2208 DK and Lebesgue a.e. w \u2208 CK, G has a \ufb01nite number of\nattracting periodic orbits, and every point is attracted to one of them.\nRemark. Not all piecewise contractions have asymptotic periodic behaviour. Simple\nexamples occur in the family fa :[ 0 ,1) \u2192 [0,1), f(x)=\u03bbx + a (mod 1), for a\n\ufb01xed \u03bb \u2208 (0,1) and parameter a \u2208 [0,1). The rotation number \u03c1(fa) depends\ncontinuously on a, and is not constant. In fact, the point 0 has period one for a =0\nand two for a =1 \/(1 + \u03bb), so \u03c1(f0)=0< 1\n2 = \u03c1(f1\/(1+\u03bb)). By continuity, if we\nvary a, we will obtain irrational rotation numbers, and in such a case, no periodic\norbits exist, and the asymptotic dynamics is an irrational rotation on a Cantor set.\nMost applications of piecewise contractions that we are familiar with are in the\nplane. Theorem 2 has higher-dimensional generalisations, where (1) is replaced by\ne.g.\nGk(x)=\u039b kx +( I \u2212 \u039bk)wk if x \u2208 Xk\nfor regions Xk \u2282 Rd and linear contractions \u039bk : Rd \u2192 Rd translated over wk \u2208 Rd.\nHowever, since the geometry of the boundaries \u2202Xk and the possible eccentricities\nof \u039bk create technicalities that only obscure the main idea, we prefer to deal only\nwith the planar case in this paper.\n2. Proof of Theorem 2\nDe\ufb01ne the itinerary of z as a sequence e(z)=e0e1 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u2208{1,...,K}N0 (N0 = N\u222a\n{0}), where en = k if Gn(z) \u2208 Xk.L e tIn be a collection of strings in {1,...,K}n\nto be speci\ufb01ed later, but satisfying the properties:\n\u2022 \u03c3(In) \u2282 In\u22121,w h e r e\u03c3 denotes the left shift,\n\u2022{ e0(z)...e n\u22121(z):z \u2208 BR}\u2282In.\nLet I =\n\u0001\nn In. De\ufb01ne a multivalued image of z by\n\u0003 Gn(z): ={Gen\u22121 \u25e6\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u25e6Ge0(z):e0 ...e n\u22121 \u2208 In}.\nThe omega-limit set is the set of accumulation points of an orbit, i.e., \u03c9(z)= \u0004\nm\n\u0001\nn\u2265m Gn(z). Let us de\ufb01ne the multivalued omega-limit set analogously:\n\u0005 \u03c9(z)=\n\u0006\nm\n\u0002\nn\u2265m\n\u0003 Gn(z).\nLemma 4. For every z \u2208 BR, \u03c9(z) \u2282 \u0005 \u03c9(0).\nProof. If y \u2208 \u03c9(z), then there is a sequence (ni)i\u2208N such that Gni(z) \u2192 y.T a k e\nxi \u2208 Ini obtained as Geni\u22121 \u25e6 Geni\u22122 \u25e6\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u25e6Ge0(0), where e = e(z) is the itinerary\nof z.S i n c e|Gni(z) \u2212 xi|\u22642R\u03bbni\nmax,w eh a v exni \u2192 y and the lemma follows. \u0001\nLet S\u03b5 be an \u03b5-neighbourhood of S.\nLemma 5. For all \u03bb \u2208 DK and Lebesgue a.e. w \u2208 CK, the following holds: for\nevery L \u2208 N,t h e r ee x i s t s\u03b5>0 and a neighbourhood U   w such that for every x \u2208 S\nand w  \u2208 U, there is at most one integer r1 \u2264 L such that S\u03b5 \u2229 Gr1(B\u03b5(x))  = \u2205.\nProof. Suppose \ufb01rst that the conclusion fails for w. Then for every m \u2208 N,t h e r e\nis xm \u2208 S and r1 <r 2 \u2264 L such that for \u03b5 =1 \/m, S\u03b5 \u2229Gri(B\u03b5(x))  = \u2205, i \u2208{ 1,2}.\nSince S is compact, and by passing to a subsequence if necessary, we can say that\nxm \u2192 x \u2208 S and there is a pair r1 <r 2 \u2264 L such that Gri(x) \u2208 S for i \u2208{ 1,2}.1392 HENK BRUIN AND JONATHAN H. B. DEANE\nThis is a condition that happens with positive co-dimension, so for Lebesgue\na.e. w, it will not occur. Finally, because G depends continuously on w,a n db y\ndecreasing \u03b5 if necessary, there is a neighbourhood U of w on which the conclusion\nremains true on U. \u0001\nLemma 6. If \u0005 \u03c9(0) \u2229 S = \u2205, then there exists N \u2208 N such that EN = E.\nProof. Since \u0005 \u03c9(0)\u2229S = \u2205,t h e r ei sN \u2208 N and \u03b5>0 such that\n\u0001\nn\u2265N \u0003 Gn(0)\u2229S\u03b5 =\n\u2205. Additionally, assume that \u03bbN\nmaxR<\u03b5 .\nLet A be any arc in En\\E n\u22121,s oGn(A) \u2282 S. Moreover, there is x \u2208 \u0003 Gn(0) such\nthat d(x,Gn(A)) <\u03bb n\nmaxR.Y e t ,i fn \u2265 N,t h e n\u03bbn\nmaxR<\u03b5 , and no such arc A can\nexist. This proves the lemma. \u0001\nLemma 7. Suppose that I =\n\u0001\nn In has the following property: there is an N\nsuch that for n \u2265 N and every e \u2208 In, there are at most L0 strings in In+L\nthat coincide with e on the \ufb01rst n coordinates. Then the Hausdor\ufb00 dimension\ndimH(\u0005 \u03c9(0)) \u2264\nlog L0\n\u2212Llog \u03bbmax.\nProof. Let an =#\u0003 Gn(0). By the condition in the lemma, an+L \u2264 L0an for every\nn \u2265 N,s oaN+iL \u2264 KNLi\n0.\nTake \u03b4>\nlog L0\n\u2212Llog \u03bbmax,s o\u03bbL\u03b4\nmaxL0 < 1. Let \u03b5>0 be arbitrary, and i so large that\n2R\u03bbm\nmax <\u03b5 ,w h e r em = N +iL. We will argue that \u0005 \u03c9(0) is contained in the union\nof closed discs Dx of radius 2R\u03bbm\nmax centred at the points x \u2208 \u0007 Gm(0).\nIndeed, let y \u2208 \u0005 \u03c9(0), and let yk \u2208 \u0007 Gnk(0) be such that yk \u2192 y. By passing to a\nsubsequence, we may assume that\nenk\u2212m(yk)...e nk\u22121(yk)=d0 ...d m\u22121;\ni.e., the itinerary of yk ends in the same m coordinates for all su\ufb03ciently large m.\nSince \u03c3(In) \u2282 In\u22121 for all n, it follows that d0 ...d m\u22121 \u2282 Im,a n dt h e r ee x i s t s\nx = Gdm\u22121 \u25e6\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u25e6Gd0(0) \u2208 \u0007 Gm(0). Therefore |x\u2212yk|\u2264\u03bbm\nmaxR for all k, and hence\ny \u2208 Dx.\nNow sum over all such discs to get\n\b\nx\u2208\u0007 Gm(0)\ndiam(Dx)\u03b4 =\n\b\nx\u2208 \u0007 Gm(0)\n(2R)\u03b4\u03bbm\u03b4\nmax \u2264 KN\u03bbN\u03b4\nmaxLi\n0(2R)\u03b4\u03bbL\u03b4i\nmax \u2264 KN\u03bbN\u03b4\nmax(2R)\u03b4\nindependently of m, where the last inequality follows from the choice of \u03b4 above.\nHence we have found a cover of \u0005 \u03c9(0) with discs Dx of diameter <\u03b5and with \t\nx diam(Dx)\u03b4 < \u221e. Since this holds for any \u03b5 and \u03b4>\nlog L0\n\u2212Llog \u03bbmax is arbitrary, the\nHausdor\ufb00 dimension dimH(\u0005 \u03c9(0)) \u2264\nlog L0\n\u2212Llog \u03bbmax as required. \u0001\nRemark. The idea of the proof of Theorem 2 is that since dimH(\u0005 \u03c9(0)) < 1, \u0005 \u03c9(0)\nshould be disjoint from S for each \u03bb and Lebesgue a.e. w \u2208 CK and \u2018generically\nparametrised\u2019 families of piecewise contractions. In the proof below, we use linearity\nin w to show that for a \ufb01xed \u03bb \u2208 DK, the family {Gw}w\u2208CK is indeed \u2018generically\nparametrised\u2019; however, the result should hold for piecewise contractions that are\nnonlinear in w as well.\nProof of Theorem 2. We can assume without loss of generality that 0 \/ \u2208 S,s o\u03b7 :=\ninf{|s| : s \u2208 S} > 0. Fix \u03bb \u2208 DK,t a k ew \u2208 CK arbitrary so that Lemma 5 holds,PIECEWISE CONTRACTIONS 1393\nand let \u03b5>0 and neighbourhood U be taken from that lemma; U can be arbitrarily\nsmall. Recall that wmax =m a x k{|wk|} and \u03bbmax =m a x k{|\u03bbk|}.L e t\nw\u2217 := 1 + sup{|w \nmax| : w  \u2208 U}.\nThen for R := 2w\u2217\/(1\u2212\u03bbmax), the disc BR satis\ufb01es Lemma 1 for every (w ,\u03bb  ) \u2208 U.\nLet L0 := K2 and take L so large that logL0\/(\u2212Llog\u03bbmax) < 1. Now take\nN \u2208 N such that 2R\u03bbN\nmax <\u03b5 .I fn \u2265 N and Y \u2282 BR is a neighbourhood on which\nGn is continuous, then diam(Gn(Y )) <\u03b5 , so by Lemma 5, each x \u2208 Gn(Y )c a n\nvisit S\u03b5 at most twice in the next L iterates. On such a visit, say the ith, Gn+i(Y )\ncan intersect all K regions Xk, but as this happens at most twice, there are at most\nK2 subregions of Y on which Gn+L is continuous. This is true for all w  \u2208 U.\nIt follows that at most bn := KNL\n(n\u2212N)\/L\n0 discs of radius \u03b5n := 2R\u03bbn\nmax are\nsu\ufb03cient to cover \u03c9(0), uniformly over (w ,\u03bb) \u2208 U.L e tIn be the collection of all\npossible itineraries of points x \u2208 BR and w  \u2208 U.F o re a c he \u2208 In,l e t\nHe,n(w ): =Gen\u22121 \u25e6\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u25e6Ge0(0)\n= \u03bben\u22121\u03bben\u22122 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03bbe1(1 \u2212 \u03bbe0)w \ne0 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\n\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+ \u03bben\u22121(1 \u2212 \u03bben\u22122)w \nen\u22122 +( 1\u2212 \u03bben\u22121)w \nen\u22121.\nSince this expression is linear in w, the partial derivative\n\u2202He,n\n\u2202wk is the sum of all\ncoe\ufb03cients of terms which contain wk.T h u s\nDe,n := max\nk\u2208{1,...,K}\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\u2202He,n(w )\n\u2202wk\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nis independent of w .T a k e\nA := {w  \u2208 CK : \u0005 \u03c9(0) \u2229 S  = \u2205}\n\u2282{ w  \u2208 CK :\n\u0002\ne\u2208In\nB\u03b5n(He,n(w )) \u2229 S  = \u2205}.\nWe show that A has no Lebesgue density points, whence Leb(A)=0 .\nLet lS be the length of S, i.e., the sum of the lengths of all recti\ufb01able curves that\ncomprise S \u2229 BR.N e x tt a k en \u2265 N such that\nbnw\u2217\u03b5nlS <\n\u03b7\n8\nLeb(U).\nEach of the at most bn discs B\u03b5n(He,n) needed to cover \u0005 \u03c9(0) moves slightly as w \nmoves in U.

DEANE\nIntegrating over the remaining w \ni (using Fubini\u2019s theorem) gives\nLeb({w  \u2208 U : B\u03b5n(He,n(w )) \u2229 S  = \u2205}) \u2264\n4w\u2217lS\u03b5n\n\u03b7\n.\nSumming over all the bn discs, we obtain\nLeb({w  \u2208 U :\n\u0002\ne\u2208In\nB\u03b5n(He,n(w )) \u2229 S  = \u2205}) \u2264\n4w\u2217lSbn\u03b5n\n\u03b7\n<\n1\n2\nLeb(U).\nSince this holds for all su\ufb03ciently small neighbourhoods U of w (adjusting n if\nnecessary), it follows that w cannot be a Lebesgue density point of A.S i n c ew was\narbitrary in a set of full measure, Leb(A) = 0, as required.\nNext we claim that if \u03c9(z)\u2229S = \u2205,t h e nz is asymptotically periodic. To prove\nthis, let y \u2208 \u03c9(z), and let the sequence (nk)k\u2208N be such that Gnk(z)= :zk \u2192 y.\nWe have \u03c9(y)\u2229S = \u2205,s ot h e r ei s\u03b4>0 such that Gn(B\u03b4(y))\u2229S = \u2205 for all n \u2265 0.\nTake k<k   such that zk,z k  \u2208 B\u03b4\/2(y)a n d\u03bb\nnk \u2212nk\nmax < 1\n4. Then, since\nzk  \u2208 Gnk \u2212nk(B\u03b4(x)) \u2282 B\n2\u03b4\u03bb\nnk  \u2212nk\nmax (yk ) \u2282 B\u03b4(x),\nthe disc B\u03b4(y) is mapped continuously into itself under Gnk \u2212nk.S oi tc o n t a i n sa\nsingle attracting periodic point attracting the orbit of z.\nFinally, apply Lemma 6 to complete the proof. \u0001\nProof of Corollary 3. On each component Y of BR \\E N, Gn is continuous and\ncontracting for all n \u2265 0, and therefore Y contains at most one periodic point pY .\nIf it does contain such a point, then every point in Y is asymptotic to orb(pY ). Since\nEN consists of a \ufb01nite number of arcs, there are \ufb01nitely many periodic orbits, and\nevery point in BR, and hence every point in C, is asymptotic to one of them. \u0001\nReferences\n[1] R.
