Depart-\ning from the existing literature that gives prominence to Congress, we carry on an empirical investigation on the\nimpact of presidents during the period 1982\u20132000. Our findings suggest that federal budget allocation is affected by\npresidential politics. States that heavily supported the incumbent president in past presidential elections tend to\nreceive more funds, while marginal and swing states are not rewarded. Party affiliation also matters since states\nwhose governor belong to the same party of the president receive more federal funds, while states opposing the pres-\nident\u2019s party in Congressional elections are penalized. These results show that presidents are engaged in tactical dis-\ntribution of federal funds and also provide good evidence in support of partisan theories of budget allocation.\nby the Budget and Accounting act of 1921 that began\na long-lasting period of domination of presidency\nover Congress. Following the escalating conflict with\nthe Nixon administration, the Congress tried then to\nregain control over the budget through the Budget\nImpoundment and Control act of 1974. According to\nSchick, the 1974 reform had \u201cthe potential of altering\npresidential-Congress relationship contributing to a\nresurgence of Congress\u201d (1979, 96). A number of\nscholars, however, argue that the president is still \nan influential player (Edwards 1980; Kiewiet and \nKrehbiel 2002) mainly because of his veto power\n(Copeland 1983; Kiewiet and McCubbins 1988;\nMcCarty 2000; Rohde and Simon 1985), since \u201cmerely\nthe threat of a veto is often enough to force Congress\nto tailor a bill to conform to administration wishes\u201d\n(Cummings and Wise 1981, 368). Historical evidence\nof presidential influence on the territorial distribution\nof federal funds has been provided by several studies\non the New Deal program. In particular, Wallis (1987)\nand Wright (1974) have found that states with high\nvolatility of presidential vote received more federal\nsupport, which is consistent with the idea that the\npresident might try to target swing voters.

Mitt Romney, Washington Post,\nMonday, November 22, 2004).1\nT\nhe allocation of the federal budget in the United\nStates is the outcome of a complex process\ninvolving numerous institutional players. A vast\ntheoretical and empirical literature has devoted a for-\nmidable effort to the study of this process. The exist-\ning empirical contributions primarily focus on\ncongressional influence via powerful individual repre-\nsentatives, such as for example committee members,\nor via political parties. The executive, however, also\nplays an important role in the budget formation: the\npresident initiates the process by sending a proposal\nto the Congress and, once the budget has been\napproved, retains a veto power that can be overridden\nonly by a qualified majority equal to two-thirds of\nCongress.\nHistorically, the balance of power between presi-\ndent and Congress over the budget has been subject\nto important changes. The authority of the executive\nover the initiation of the budget was first established\n1Interview with Republican governor Mitt Romney, following the reelection of G. W.

Despite the vibrant\ntheoretical debate on the respective roles of Congress\nand president, the empirical literature on contempo-\nrary federal budget allocation has paid attention\nmainly to the legislative power. To address the short-\ncomings of this one-sided approach, this paper inves-\ntigates whether the president has a systematic impact\non the allocation of the federal budget to the states. In\ndoing so, we provide a comprehensive empirical test\nof the existing theoretical models of tactical redistrib-\nution. Our results add new significant insights to the\nconspicuous empirical literature on federal budget\nallocation and are of extreme relevance to both the\ntheoretical study of American political institutions\nand the debate on possible reforms of the budget\nprocess.\nFrom a theoretical point of view, the executive\nmay have several reasons to sway the federal budget\nallocation away from a purely social welfare maximiz-\ning objective (McCarty 2000). Namely, the president\nmay use budget allocation to enhance his reelection\nchances either by targeting swing states or by reward-\ning his supporters. Lindbeck and Weibull (1987, 1993)\nprovide theoretical models explaining why political\nactors should redistribute funds to marginal and\nswing states in order to maximize their chances of\nwinning elections. Cox and McCubbins (1986) argue\ninstead that, because of the ideological relationship\nbetween voters and candidates, more funds should be\nallocated where policymakers have larger support. In\nparticular, the targeting of loyal voters can be seen as\na safer investment as compared to aiming for swing\nvoters. Hence, risk-adverse political actors who want\nto maximize their chances of winning elections \nshould allocate more funds to loyal states. Dixit and\nLondregan (1996) provide an alternative model where\npoliticians face incentives to target both swing and\nloyal voters. On the one hand, moderate voters, who\nare indifferent between two parties, can more easily be\nbought; on the other, core supporters can be targeted\nin a more efficient way because parties know their\npreferences better.\nBesides targeting specific groups of voters, the\npresident could also try to further his legislative\nagenda by directing spending to specific legislators.\nMoreover, \u201cas a leader of his party, he may feel the\npressure to favor legislative districts controlled by\nmembers of his party\u201d (McCarty 2000). Assuming that\nparty reputation is a public good for individual party\nmembers, Cox and McCubbins (1993) provide a the-\noretical explanation for cooperation among represen-\ntatives belonging to the same party.4 Along the same\nline, Dasgupta, Dhillon, and Dutta (2004) argue that\nwhen the electoral returns from spending are shared\nbetween state and central government, then transfer-\nring funds to a governor of the opponent party \ngenerates a \u201cleakage\u201d effect whereby the central \ngovernment looses part of the electoral benefit from\nspending. Finally, if state governments have some dis-\ncretion in the way funds are spent, then the federal\nadministration could prefer to allocate more funds to\ngovernors with the same policy preferences. All this\nseems to suggest that the president has incentives to\nsway the allocation of federal funds in the direction of\n\u201cfriendly\u201d administrators.\nThis study will test these alternative theories of\npresidential influence. In particular, we will first esti-\nmate the effect of the presidential electoral race on the\nbudget allocation to find out whether the president\nrewards his supporters or whether he targets states\nthat are marginal or swing in presidential elections.\nSecond, to uncover whether the president diverts\nfederal funds toward states controlled by members of\nhis party, we will estimate the effect of partisan align-\nment between the president and the state governors\nand\/or state representatives.\nThe impact of the president as a party leader and,\nmore generally, the distributive effects of cooperation\nbetween representatives belonging to the same party,\nare important theoretical questions that have not been\nexplored yet by the empirical literature on partisan\nbudgeting, that tends instead to focus on the role of\nparties inside Congress. Among the contributions on\ncongressional partisan budgeting, Levitt and Snyder\n(1995) find that, when Congress was dominated by\ndemocratic majorities, outlays at the district level were\n2Anderson and Tollison (1991) also find evidence of committee\ninfluence on New Deal spending.\n3For an overview of the literature on New Deal spending see\nCouch and Shugart (1998) and Fishback, Kantor, and Wallis\n(2003).\n4The evidence reported by the media on cooperation between\nparty members is abundant. During presidential campaigns a\nhuge emphasis is placed, for example, on the ability of governors\nto deliver the votes of their state.\n\uf761\uf76c\uf76c\uf76f\uf763\uf761\uf774\uf769\uf76e\uf767 \uf774\uf768\uf765 \uf775.\uf773. \uf766\uf765\uf764\uf765\uf772\uf761\uf76c \uf762\uf775\uf764\uf767\uf765\uf774 \uf774\uf76f \uf774\uf768\uf765 \uf773\uf774\uf761\uf774\uf765\uf773: \uf774\uf768\uf765 \uf769\uf76d\uf770\uf761\uf763\uf774 \uf76f\uf766 \uf774\uf768\uf765 \uf770\uf772\uf765\uf773\uf769\uf764\uf765\uf76e\uf774 \uf734\uf734\uf739\npositively correlated with the district share of demo-\ncratic votes.5 Similarly, Carsey and Rundquist (1999)\nfind that states represented by Democrats on a defense\ncommittee receive more military procurement awards.\nBickers and Stein (2000) find that the Republican\ncontrol of the 104th Congress altered the composition\nof federal outlays in favor of programs that are \nmore compatible with the interests of Republican \nrepresentatives.6\nOne important advantage of our empirical analy-\nsis is that it relies on panel data on federal outlays over\na relatively long time span. The panel structure allows\nus to use state-fixed effects to account for state-level\nunobserved heterogeneity and identify the effect of\nthe relevant political and economic variables.7 Since\nthe president, unlike most other individual players,\ncan exercise his influence on any budgetary aggregate,\nwe decided to focus our attention on total federal\noutlays. This approach has its own drawbacks but, for\nour purposes, also provides substantial advantages.\nFocusing on very specific aggregates, as most literature\ndoes, makes it possible to shed light on specific forms\nof influence and to be very precise on them. This is\nparticularly true for studies on committees, where dis-\ntortions are more often found on specific spending\nprograms. It is, however, quite possible that the dis-\ntortions introduced by different actors with limited\ninfluence may offset each other leaving a state without\na real advantage in the overall allocation of federal\nfunds. Since the presidential influence is not limited\nto particular aggregates, then it is more likely that a\nstate can be favored in the overall budget allocation\nfor reasons related to presidential politics. Therefore,\ntotal federal spending is the place where the presiden-\ntial influence is more likely to be detected. Focusing\non whether a state receives, on aggregate, more federal\nfunds, we are of course capturing only a particular\nchannel through which political actors may divert\nfunds toward their constituencies. The composition of\nthe budget is another instrument that can be used to\nfavor interests located in a given constituency, as it is\nshown by Bickers and Stein (2000).\nWhile we are primarily interested in the role of the\npresident, we also incorporate into the analysis the\nother relevant institutional players (Congress and\ncommittees) because excluding some explanatory\nvariables in the regressions may lead to the well-\nknown problem of omitted variable bias.8 Therefore,\nwe check the robustness of our results by simultane-\nously estimating in the same regressions the impact of\nseveral channels of political influence that, according\nto previous studies, may crucially affect federal budget\nallocation. Following Atlas et al. (1995) and Lee\n(1998), we control for overrepresentation of small\nstates in Congress. Furthermore, individual represen-\ntatives occupying key positions in the budget process\ncan convey disproportionate amounts of money to\ntheir districts (Fenno 1973; Kiewiet and McCubbins\n1988). According to several scholars, committees are\nvery influential in determining the budget allocation\n(Shepsle and Weingast 1987) since they have an\nadvantage both in terms of their agenda-setting power\n(McKelvey and Ordeshook 1980) and in terms of\ninformation and competence9 (Krehbiel 1991). Hence,\nwe follow the empirical literature on committee influ-\nence10 and introduce committee membership in our\nanalysis.\nTo briefly summarize our main results, we find\nthat the president has an important impact on the\nallocation of the budget to the states. In particular,\nstates that ideologically lean towards the president,\ni.e., states with a high share of presidential votes or\nwith a governor belonging to the party of the presi-\ndent, tend to be rewarded with more funds. On the\nother hand, states with a close presidential electoral\nrace and states that either changed political affiliation\n5Evidence of a bias in favour of democratic districts is also\nreported by Alvarez and Saving (1997), Kiewiet and McCubbins\n(1985) and Owens and Wade (1984). Some recent literature has\ninvestigated the role of parties on budget allocation also in other\ncountries. Dasgupta, Dhillon, and Dutta (2004) find that Indian\nstates ruled by the same party that controls the central goverment\nreceive more grants, while Dahlberg and Johansson (2002) find\nthat the Swedish regions that are \u201cswing\u201d in the national elections\nreceive a higher share of a specific transfer program.\n6They find, for example, a remarkable increase in the pro-business\ncontingent liabilities.\n7When data on specific years are used instead, it is hard to say if\nthe results obtained are merely due to particular features of the\ndata considered or to proper and long-lasting political influence.\n8When different explanatory variables are correlated, as it seems\nreasonable to expect in most cases, omitting relevant players could\ndeliver biased estimates of the impact of those considered.\n9Weingast and Marshall (1988) argue that committees are the\ndevices that make logrolling work, by facilitating the trade of influ-\nence in the absence of a spot market for the exchanging of support.\n10The empirical literature on committee influence is vast and,\nalthough the results are sometimes mixed, committee influence is\nusually found on specific spending categories rather than large\naggregates. Among the numerous studies on committees see\nAldrich and Rohde (2000), Alvarez and Saving (1997), Anderson\nand Tollison (1991), Bond, Bonneau, and Cottril (2004), Carsey\nand Rundquist (1999), Ferejohn (1974), Goss (1972), Kiel and\nMcKinzie (1983), Knight (2005), Levitt and Poterba (1999),\nOwens and Wade (1984), Plott (1968), Ray (1981), Rich (1989),\nRitt (1976), Rundquist and Griffith (1976), and Strom (1975). For\nan overview on the Committee influence literature see Bond et al.\n(2004).\n\uf734\uf735\uf730 \uf776\uf761\uf76c\uf765\uf76e\uf774\uf769\uf76e\uf76f \uf76c\uf761\uf772\uf763\uf769\uf76e\uf765\uf773\uf765, \uf76c\uf765\uf76f\uf76e\uf77a\uf769\uf76f \uf772\uf769\uf77a\uf77a\uf76f, \uf761\uf76e\uf764 \uf763\uf765\uf763\uf769\uf76c\uf769\uf761 \uf774\uf765\uf773\uf774\uf761\nin the most recent election or that are historically\nvolatile do not receive more money. Hence, overall our\nanalysis suggests that the president is a relevant player\nas he can direct more funding toward those states that\nare run by \u201cfriendly\u201d governors and that have large\ngroups of \u201ccore supporters.\u201d Finally, our analysis indi-\ncates that partisanship plays an important role since\ngovernors politically aligned with the president receive\nmore resources and Congress members opposing the\npresident bring less funds to their states.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as\nfollows. The next section describes our data set and\nlays out our empirical approach. We then present our\nmain results, and, in the last section, we provide our\nconclusions.\nData and Methodology\nFollowing the theoretical literature on partisan budg-\neting (Cox and McCubbins 1986; Dixit and Lon-\ndregan 1996; Lindbeck and Weibull 1987, 1993) and\npresidential influence (Kiewiet and Krehbiel 2002;\nMcCarty 2000) the hypotheses we want to test may be\nsummarized as follows:\nH1: federal funds are disproportionately targeted to\nstates that are marginal and swing in presiden-\ntial elections (swing bias);\nH2: federal funds are disproportionately targeted to\nstates where the president is supported by a large\nshare of the electorate (ideological bias);\nH3: party alignment of state governors and\/or Con-\ngress representatives with the executive increases\nthe receipt of federal funds (party alignment).\nFor completeness, we also check what is the\nimpact of the alignment of governors and state\nrepresentatives with Congress majorities.\nWe use data on federal outlays for the 48 U.S.\ncontinental states from 1982 to 2000.11 Table A1 in the\nonline statistical appendix reports average per capita\nfederal outlays during the period 1982\u20132000\n(expressed in real dollars for the year 2000). It is\nimmediately clear that the differences in spending can\nbe substantial. An average resident of Virginia, for\nexample, has received every year almost $2,700 more\nthan an average resident of Wisconsin. While this gap\ncan be entirely due to the needs and characteristics of\nthe respective populations, it is legitimate to ask how\nmuch of this difference can be due to purely political\nfactors. For this purpose we estimate the following\nequation:12\n(1)\nwhere FEDEXPst is the real per-capita federal expen-\nditure (outlays) in state s at time t. As in all the sub-\nsequent regressions, we include state-fixed effects and\nyear dummies. Zst is a vector that includes real income\nper capita, state population, unemployment rate, per-\ncentage of citizens aged 65 or above, and percentage\nof citizens between 5 and 17 years old. We keep these\nexplanatory variables in all the regressions as standard\neconomic and demographic controls. Finally, Pisw rep-\nresents the set of institutional and political variables\nunder consideration.13\nIt is important to point out that in the U.S. budget\nprocess there is a lag between the appropriation of\nfederal funds and the moment when these are actually\nspent. This is relevant when estimating the effect of\nparticular institutional and political variables, since\ncurrent federal outlays have normally been appropri-\nated in previous budgetary years. Delays should there-\nfore be taken into account. Hence, we introduce lagged\nvalues for Pist, since past policymakers are responsible\nfor current outlays. To give the right weight to lagged\nindependent variables explaining current outlays, we\nuse weighted averages of lagged Pis, where the weights\nare determined by the spend-out rates utilized in offi-\ncial forecasts. The reported results are based on the\nassumption that 60% of appropriated expenditure is\nspent within one year and the rest two years later.14\nHence, we regress outlays at time t on the weighted\naverage of two lagged variables, i.e., Pisw = .6 * P\ni\nst\u22121 + .4\n* Pist\u22122.\nHypotheses 1 and 2. We begin our analysis by con-\nsidering the role of electoral competition in the pres-\nidential electoral race.

Usually those states tend to be excluded to facili-\ntate comparison with previous research. Another reason, and\nprobably a better one, however, is that they attract a dispropor-\ntionate amount of federal spending for either aministrative\nreasons (DC) or strategic reasons (Alaska and Hawaii receive a\nsubstantial share of defense spending). This could render the\npolitical motivations behind an observed distribution less \nrecognizable.\n12All equations have been estimated by using Stata 8.2.\n13Summary statistics are reported online in the statistical \nappendix, http:\/\/www.journalofpolitics.org.\n14See Horney and Greenstein (2000) for estimates of spendout\nrates. Official spendout rates are estimated each year by the CBO\nand OMB but they can display substantial variations. For this\nreason we have considered several possibilities, both increasing the\nfirst-year spendout rate up to 80% and increasing the number of\nlags up to five years. Our results show very little sensitivity to such\nvariations.\n\uf761\uf76c\uf76c\uf76f\uf763\uf761\uf774\uf769\uf76e\uf767 \uf774\uf768\uf765 \uf775.\uf773. \uf766\uf765\uf764\uf765\uf772\uf761\uf76c \uf762\uf775\uf764\uf767\uf765\uf774 \uf774\uf76f \uf774\uf768\uf765 \uf773\uf774\uf761\uf774\uf765\uf773: \uf774\uf768\uf765 \uf769\uf76d\uf770\uf761\uf763\uf774 \uf76f\uf766 \uf774\uf768\uf765 \uf770\uf772\uf765\uf773\uf769\uf764\uf765\uf76e\uf774 \uf734\uf735\uf731\nimpact of the closeness of the presidential elections in\neach state with that of the share of votes obtained by\nthe president in the last election.15 A negative sign of\nthe closeness variable should be regarded as support\nfor the idea that the president tends to direct resources\nto marginal states in order to increase his chances of\nreelection. A positive sign of the share of presidential\nvotes should instead be seen as evidence that incum-\nbents tend to reward states that show their support in\nelections. We also take into account the fact that not\nall states have the same weight in presidential elections\nby including the number of electoral votes per capita\nby state.\nThe closeness of the past election is, however, not\nnecessarily the best measure to identify swing states.\nWe, therefore, generate an indicator of long-term\nswing which is based on the number of times a state\nswung its support from a party to another in the last\nfour presidential elections.16\nHypotheses 3. As previously discussed, the parti-\nsanship of different representatives can have an\nimportant effect on budget allocation since coopera-\ntion between different political actors belonging to the\nsame party is likely to occur. In particular, the presi-\ndent, acting as a party leader, may divert funds toward\nstate governors and state representatives belonging to\nhis own party. Hence, we consider a series of dummy\nvariables to capture various levels of partisan align-\nment between central powers and state governments.\nWe first create three dummy variables to reflect the\npolitical alignment of state governors with, respec-\ntively, the president and the majorities in the House\nand in the Senate. In a further specification we also\nconsider the possibility that the allocation of funds to\na given state is facilitated by party alignment between\nthe governor and the majority of state delegates to the\nHouse or the governor and both senators. We then\nconsider the potential effect of having the president\nand a majority of state delegates in the House, or the\npresident and both senators from a given state,\nbelonging to the same party. Finally, we consider the\npotential advantage of having a majority of state del-\negates to the House belonging to the House majority\nparty or having both senators belonging to the Senate\nmajority.\nWe are aware that testing our hypotheses sepa-\nrately has a major limitation because, by considering\none element at time, we can miss relevant correlations\nand incorrectly estimate some effects. For this reason\nwe run a regression including all the Pisw vectors in one\nequation of the form:\n(2)\nThe results we get from equation (2) provide the\nbig picture that is missed when focussing on specific\nchannels of influence and provide an important\nrobustness check.\nResults\nSwing and Ideological Bias\nIn Table 1 we focus on presidential elections to test the\nswing-voter hypothesis and contrast it with the poten-\ntial presence of ideological bias. Column 1 shows that,\nwhile the share of presidential votes in the past elec-\ntion displays a positive and significant coefficient,\nthe closeness of the same election has no significant\neffect.17 In column 2 we consider the swing variable\nand we find again no evidence in support of the\nswing-voter hypothesis, while the share of presidential\nvote has always a positive and significant effect.18\nDepending on the specification considered, the differ-\nence in spending between a state with maximum share\nof presidential vote and a state with the minimum of\nFEDEXPst s t\ni\nsw\ni\nst st\ni\n= + + + +\u2211a b eq q1 2P Z ,\n15Hypothesis 1 and 2 are different because, although correlated,\nthe closeness and the presidential share of votes measure two sep-\narate electoral phenomena. First, they can be different when there\nare more than two candidates. More importantly, however, they\nare different because, while an electoral race can be equally \u201cclose\u201d\nin states where the president has won or lost to the opponent, the\nshare of presidential votes will necessarily be different when the\npresident wins.\n16We have also used two other measures of electoral volatility. One\nis a moving average of the frequency of swings from one party to\nthe other that starts from the 1964 election. The other is an indi-\ncator of short-term volatility represented by a dummy equal to one\nfor the states that switched their support in the last election. Our\nresults do not change when we use such alternative measures.\nFurther details can be found in the online statistical appendix.\n17Concerning the economic variables, states with higher income\nper capita receive significantly less, as do states with larger popu-\nlation. The percentage of aged population also has a positive and\nsignificant effect. The percentage of children in schooling age has\ninstead a negative and significant effect, while the unemployment\nrate is completely uncorrelated with aggregate spending per\ncapita. The signs and significance of those coefficients remain sub-\nstantially the same in all the subsequent specifications.\n18One obvious concern is that the significance of our estimates\ncould be heavily conditioned by multicollinearity among the inde-\npendent variables. To verify that the correlations of our predictors\ndo not significantly inflate the estimation of their standard errors,\nwe calculate the Variance Inflation Factor for all the regressions we\npresent in this work. Here, as well as in all the subsequent regres-\nsions, we find that that multicollinearity has a very limited impact\non our results. A description of the methodology and detailed\nresults are reported online in the statistical appendix.\n\uf734\uf735\uf732 \uf776\uf761\uf76c\uf765\uf76e\uf774\uf769\uf76e\uf76f \uf76c\uf761\uf772\uf763\uf769\uf76e\uf765\uf773\uf765, \uf76c\uf765\uf76f\uf76e\uf77a\uf769\uf76f \uf772\uf769\uf77a\uf77a\uf76f, \uf761\uf76e\uf764 \uf763\uf765\uf763\uf769\uf76c\uf769\uf761 \uf774\uf765\uf773\uf774\uf761\nsuch a share goes from $536 (column 1) to $908\n(column 2) per capita per year, which implies that one\nstandard deviation in the share of presidential vote is\nworth $97\u2013164. These findings are in line with some\nof the existing literature. For example, Anderson and\nTollison (1991) and Couch and Shugart (1998) find a\npositive correlation between spending at the state level\nand Roosevelt\u2019s share of votes in 1932, and Wright\n(1974) finds no effect of the closeness of the presi-\ndential race.19\nTo summarize, we find that the ideological bias\ntoward safe states is substantial in terms of both mag-\nnitude and statistical significance. We do not find\ninstead any evidence of the refined targeting of swing\nand marginal states that some formal models seem to\nsuggest. Assuming that electors cast their votes\ndepending on the amount of spending they receive\nand also on their ideological affinity to a party, the\nswing voter bias should come from the fact that mod-\nerate voters (who are indifferent between two parties) \ncan be more easily convinced to switch their vote \nin favor of the party that has rewarded them with\nspending. However, as Dixit and Londregan (1995)\npoint out, the electoral return from a dollar of spend-\ning is higher when targeted to an electorate whose\npreferences the politician understands well. Hence,\nalthough the vote of the moderate electors may be\n\u201ccheaper\u201d to buy, the informational advantage and\nability of parties to target funds more efficiently to\ntheir supporters can explain why allocating more\nspending to states with many loyal voters can deliver\na better electoral return than targeting areas with\nmany swing voters.\nParty Alignment\nIn this section we explore the effect of partisan align-\nment between central and state government. Our\nanalysis provides support for the idea that partisan-\nship matters and that political actors exchange favors\nand policies within the party boundaries. Column 1\nof Table 2 shows that the coefficient of the alignment\nbetween the president and the governor in a given\nstate has a positive and statistically significant impact.\nThe size of the coefficient is also relevant, implying a\ntransfer of approximately $135\u2013138 per capita per\nyear. On the other hand, we find that the effect of\nalignment of governors with the majority in either\nchamber of Congress is not significant. This is espe-\ncially important because it shows both the relevance\nof party affiliation at different levels of governance\nand the prominent role of the president in the budget\nprocess as a party leader.\nIn column 2, we include other alignment vari-\nables. The significance and magnitude of the align-\nment between governors and the president appears\nunaffected by the introduction of new variables. Other\nalignment variables appear to have no statistically \nsignificant impact. The only exception is represented\nby having a majority of state delegates to the House\nbelonging to the same party of the president. This\nagain suggests that the widespread emphasis on the\nrole of the House in the allocation of the federal\nbudget can obscure the important role played by both\nthe president and the party affiliation.20\nThese results turn out to be very robust to differ-\nent specifications where the three hypotheses (swing\nvoter, ideological bias, and party allignment) are con-\nT\uf761\uf762\uf76c\uf765 1 Swing and Ideological Bias\nDependent variable: real per capita federal outlays,\n1982\u20132000\n(1) (2)\nDependent Variable fedexp fedexp\nShare of vote for the 1,821.43 1,076.899\nincumbent president (2.75)*** (2.34)**\nCloseness \u2212615.15\n(1.46)\nSwing \u2212139.3107\n(1.25)\nElectoral votes per capita 386.04 345.1779\n(1.72)* (1.55)\nObservations 864 864\nR-squared .9353 .9347\nOLS regressions; Robust t statistics in parentheses (*significant at\n10%; **significant at 5%; ***significant at 1%).\nIn all regressions the following controls are included: income,\nunemployment, population, percentage of aged, percentage of\nchildren, state fixed effects, year fixed effects, constant term.\nDetailed definitions of all variables are reported in the online sta-\ntistical appendix.\n19Our results are also consistent with the findings of Str\u00f6mberg\n(2004), who shows how, when state fixed effects are included in\nthe regressions, evidence that swing states received more federal\nsupport under the New Deal vanishes.\n20To take into account possible multicollinearity we also run sep-\narate regressions for different forms of alignment. The results\n(available online in the statistical appendix) remain unchanged,\nwith the exception of the alignment between the majority of state\ndelegates and the House Majority, which has now a negative\nimpact. This is not surprising if we consider that the House has\nbeen mostly opposed to the president in the period we consider\n(with the exception of the period 1993\u201394). To confirm this, when\nwe directly include alignments with the president (column 2 of\nTable 2), this result vanishes.\n\uf761\uf76c\uf76c\uf76f\uf763\uf761\uf774\uf769\uf76e\uf767 \uf774\uf768\uf765 \uf775.\uf773. \uf766\uf765\uf764\uf765\uf772\uf761\uf76c \uf762\uf775\uf764\uf767\uf765\uf774 \uf774\uf76f \uf774\uf768\uf765 \uf773\uf774\uf761\uf774\uf765\uf773: \uf774\uf768\uf765 \uf769\uf76d\uf770\uf761\uf763\uf774 \uf76f\uf766 \uf774\uf768\uf765 \uf770\uf772\uf765\uf773\uf769\uf764\uf765\uf76e\uf774 \uf734\uf735\uf733\nsidered at the same time.21 Our robustness checks\nconfirm that some states receive disproportionate\namounts of money for reasons essentially linked to\npolitics and to the budget allocation process. The\nresults concerning the president, as well as the support\nfor partisan theories, turn out to be particularly\nrobust.\nThe role of parties in American politics has been\nreconsidered in recent research, and new evidence\nabout party cohesion casts some doubts on the\ncommon view that American parties are weak organ-\nizations, with limited ideological divide (Rohde 1991).\nIf parties are influential, then the president, as a party\nleader, may favor legislative districts controlled by\nmembers of his party. By showing that the president\nis able to target more funds toward states that are con-\ntrolled by state governors belonging to his party, we\nfind good evidence in support of the theoretical liter-\nature that gives prominence to political parties and\nparty leaders in shaping public policies. Consistent\nwith Levitt and Snyder (1995), who find that demo-\ncratic districts received more federal spending under\nthe Carter administration than under the Reagan\nadministration, we also find that state representatives\nopposing the president bring less funds to their states\nas compared to representatives aligned with the \npresident.\nConcerning the relationship between the presi-\ndent and the state governors, Carsey and Wright\n(1998) find that votes in gubernatorial elections cru-\ncially depend on presidential approval rate. On the\nother hand, governors can play an important role in\npresidential elections as suggested by the attention the\nmedia devote to the ability of state governors to\n\u201cdeliver\u201d the vote of their state. The casual evidence on\nthe privileged partisan link between president and\ngovernors is abundant.22 The endorsement of gover-\nnors also plays a fundamental role in the selection of\npresidential candidates during primaries23 and the\ngovernors\u2019 associations underline their important role\nin shaping federal policies.24 Uncovering that the par-\ntisanship of state governors and president is an impor-\ntant determinant of the distribution of federal funds\nto the states, our study provides evidence of an effec-\ntive link between governors and the president through\npolitical parties.\nT\uf761\uf762\uf76c\uf765 2 Alignment\nDependent variable: real per capita federal outlays,\n1982\u20132000\n(1) (2)\nDependent Variable fedexp fedexp\nAlignment Governor-President 134.904 137.917\n(2.35)** (2.52)**\nAlignment Governor-House 100.720 100.078\n(1.54) (1.56)\nAlignment Governor-Senate 12.3287 36.8956\n(.28) (.86)\nAlignment between the  \u22125.3423\nGovernor and the majority (.11)\nof state delegates in the\nHouse\nAlignment between the \u221299.7257\nGovernor and the two (1.60)\nstate senators\nAlignment between the  22.1627\nPresident and the two state (.39)\nsenators\nAlignment between the  235.273\nPresident and the majority (3.02)***\nof state delegates in the\nHouse\nAlignment between the 71.001\nmajority of state delegates (.93)\nin the House and the House \nmajority\nAlignment between the two 36.5556\nsenators of the state and the (.76)\nSenate majority\nObservations 864 864\nR-squared .9273 .9326\nOLS regressions; Robust t statistics in parentheses (*significant at\n10%; **significant at 5%; ***significant at 1%).\nIn all regressions the following controls are included: income,\nunemployment, population, percentage of aged, percentage of\nchildren, state fixed effects, year fixed effects, constant term.

This study shows that\npresidents are also engaged in tactical distribution of\nfederal funds to the states. This conclusion is sup-\nported by a number of findings concerning the rela-\ntion of federal spending with both the results of\npresidential elections and the party affiliation of the\npresident. States that display large support for the\npresidential party tend to be rewarded. States where\nthe governor belongs to the same party of the presi-\ndent receive more funds, while states that have a del-\negation in the House which is predominantly opposed\nto the president tend to be penalized. These results\nalso seem to show that parties are important players\nand that the president tend to act as a party leader.\nCongressional pork barrel is often viewed as a\ncommon and almost inevitable consequence of repre-\nsentative democracy where elected representatives use\nfederal funds in order to buy political support.\nHowever, presidents themselves, as elected representa-\ntives of broader constituencies, are not immune from\nthe same problem. Starting from the 1980s, all presi-\ndencies have put forward proposals for the introduc-\ntion of presidential line-item veto25 and expanded\nimpoundment control aiming at increasing the power\nof the president to control unnecessary congressional\npork-barrel spending. These proposals have raised the\nsuspicion of a possible change in the balance of power\nbetween executive and Congress mainly because the\nimpoundment power, before the 1974 budget act, has\nbeen extensively used by the presidency to override\ncongressional budget priorities. However, whether this\nshift in power might be desirable or not depends,\namong other factors, on whether the executive could\nbe a more effective body in controlling pork-barrel\nspending. Our study casts some doubts on the disci-\nplining role of the executive and suggests that the\narguments for increasing the power of the president\non budgetary matters should be taken with due\ncaution.\nOur findings also shed light on alternative theo-\nries of electoral competition. We find that states with\na large share of presidential supporters get more\nfunds, but we do not find that more federal monies\nare allocated to marginal or swing states. This evi-\ndence, while corroborating the hypothesis of ideolog-\nical bias formalized by existing theoretical models,\nalso suggests that we need further theoretical research\non the ongoing link between parties and \u201ccore sup-\nporters.\u201d If one investigates the reasons behind voters\u2019\nloyalty, then it is hard to justify why loyal voters should\nsupport political actors that systematically allocate\nfunds to the advantage of swing voters. Hence, in a\ncontext of repeated interactions between the elec-\ntorate and the politicians, loyalty in itself can be sus-\ntained only if political actors build a reputation of\nrewarding their supporters. The need for such a long-\nterm perspective provides a further rationale for the\nimportance of parties in the process of allocating\nfederal resources.\nFurther empirical investigation is also necessary\nto gain more insights on presidential pork barrel. In\nparticular, an analysis of disaggregated spending cat-\negories could be useful in order to find out if there are\nbudget aggregates which are more prone to presiden-\ntial manipulation and whether different spending \ncategories are used to achieve different goals.26 To \nconclude, by using panel data on a relatively long time\nspan and by testing various theories on the same data\nset, we reach new and robust findings which help in\nevaluating current models of tactical redistribution\nand possible reforms of the U.S. budget process.\nHaving established that presidents are involved in tac-\ntical redistribution in cooperation with other institu-\ntional players, we suggest new directions for further\nresearch where more attention should be granted to\nthe interplay of different political actors.\nAcknowledgments\nWe wish to thank Tim Besley, Torun Dewan, Giovanni\nFacchini, Robert Franzese, Simon Hix, Jim Snyder,\nCristiana Vitale, and three anonymous referees for\nhelpful discussions and suggestions, and the partici-\npants in seminars at STICERD, Royal Holloway\nCollege, Ente Einaudi, LSE, Bocconi University, FGV,\nUSP, LAMES 2004 Santiago, PET04 Beijing, the Public\n25The line-item veto was introduced in 1997 under the Clinton\nadministration, but was declared unconstitutional only one year\nlater. Recently, in a news conference in November 2004, President\nG. W. Bush has reiterated the administration wish for the reintro-\nduction of the line-item veto. For an overview on the proposals of\nline-item veto see Fisher (2004).\n26Since cooperation between members belonging to the same party\ncan also be due to policy motivation, it could happen that, when\nstate governments have more discretion on how to spend certain\nfunds, the bias toward friendly governors might be bigger. An\ninvestigation along those lines goes beyond the scope of this paper,\nbut this is an interesting empirical question that we leave for\nfurther research.\n\uf761\uf76c\uf76c\uf76f\uf763\uf761\uf774\uf769\uf76e\uf767 \uf774\uf768\uf765 \uf775.\uf773. \uf766\uf765\uf764\uf765\uf772\uf761\uf76c \uf762\uf775\uf764\uf767\uf765\uf774 \uf774\uf76f \uf774\uf768\uf765 \uf773\uf774\uf761\uf774\uf765\uf773: \uf774\uf768\uf765 \uf769\uf76d\uf770\uf761\uf763\uf774 \uf76f\uf766 \uf774\uf768\uf765 \uf770\uf772\uf765\uf773\uf769\uf764\uf765\uf76e\uf774 \uf734\uf735\uf735\nEconomics weekend at the University of Essex and the\n2005 meeting of the Midwest Political Science Associ-\nation for their useful comments.
