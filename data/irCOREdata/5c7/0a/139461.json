Photothermal expansion in aqueous samples caused the\ndeflection of a water meniscus held across a 200\uf06dm-radius pinhole. Displacement of the water meniscus\nwas measured using fibre optic interferometry. A mercury discharge lamp (254nm) and a laser diode\n(678nm) were used to detect to absorption by 2ppb anthracene and 0.5ppm potassium permanganate in\naqueous solution, respectively. The technique was used to detect differences between absorption\ncoefficients in aqueous solutions down to approximately 20% of the background absorption of the water\nitself.\n1 Introduction\nThe measurement of optical absorption in water is a well-known analytical technique. Photoacoustic\ndetection of trace chemicals in water has a number of advantages over conventional transmission\nspectroscopy, chiefly a high signal to noise ratio and relative insensitivity to light scattering within the\nsample [1,2].\nMuch recent work has been concerned with the detection of transient signals excited by high power pulsed\nlight sources[3]. Hand et al have used a fibre-optic interferometer to measure the transient displacement of\nthe surface of liquids caused by photoacoustic absorption of laser pulses in the bulk[4,5]. Their open cell\ndesign was appropriate for use with a pulsed source, but not suited to modulated cw sources.\nOur technique has a number of similarities to the Golay cell, which was developed as a detector of infrared\nradiation[6,7] but was later refined for photoacoustic gas detection[8]. Thermal expansion of the gas within\nthe closed cell resulted in deflection of a thin, flexible mirror, detected with sub-\u00c5ngstrom sensitivity using\nan optical technique.\nThis paper addresses the operation of a novel photothermal system and its use in the detection of trace\ncompounds in water. A mercury discharge lamp and a laser diode were used as low-cost, reliable light\nsources suitable for use within a process environment. These sources may be electronically modulated over\na wide range of frequencies, avoiding the additional acoustic noise at the modulation frequency which\nwould be expected when using a mechanical chopper.\n22 Principle of operation\nA schematic diagram of the closed cell is shown in Figure 1. Light of a characteristic wavelength is\nabsorbed by target chemicals, heating the solvent and causing it to expand. In a closed cell, this expansion\nof the fluid lying in the optical path increases the pressure on the surrounding fluid and on itself. The\nmagnitude of the pressure increase is determined by the mechanical compressibility, or compliance\n(\uf0b6V\/\uf0b6P), of the cell and the enclosed fluid. At the top of the cell a flat, horizontal water meniscus,\nconstrained by surface forces across a 200\uf06dm pinhole, acts as a sensor. Pressure changes within the cell\ncause the centre of the meniscus to be deflected and this displacement is monitored using fibre optic\ninterferometry. The magnitude of the photothermal response of the system has been considered in detail in\nthe Appendix.\nFigure 1. Schematic diagram of photothermal detector\nBecause of its similarity to an ordinary fluid-in-glass thermometer, we have described this arrangement as a\nphotothermal detector. Moreau et al have found that the sensitivity of such thermometers is limited in\npractice by irregularities in the movement of the fluid meniscus caused by contact angle hysteresis at the\nfluid \/ glass interface[9]. In our technique, the problem of contact angle hysteresis has been removed by\npinning the edges of the fluid meniscus at the pinhole. The curvature of the meniscus is then determined by\nthe excess pressure in the cell. We have therefore created a novel pressure transducer and the apparatus\ncould equally well be described as a low-frequency photoacoustic detector.\nAnthracene (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, PAH) and potassium permanganate (KMnO4) were chosen\nas representative species to be detected in aqueous solution. PAHs are carcinogenic pollutants of interest to\nthe water industry. KMnO4 is a known photoacoustic absorption standard which does not fluoresce,\nphosphoresce or undergo photochemical reactions when excited at 678nm, and therefore delivers all the\nabsorbed energy quickly to the solvent as heat[10].\n3 Experimental\n3.1 Cell design\nThe cell had a cylindrical internal bore of length 50mm and radius 10mm. The inside of the cell was\npolished to increase its specular reflectivity and reduce the magnitude of the possible spurious signal\nresulting from scattered light hitting the cell walls. The sapphire windows were clamped against the metal\nend surfaces with a thin polymer sealing ring, so that they could easily be removed for cleaning.\n3The meniscus was formed at a 200\uf06dm radius pinhole in a horizontal nickel foil disc, which was 3mm in\ndiameter and 40\uf06dm thick. A selection of pinhole diameters was available as a Utility Pinhole Set (Ealing\nElectro-Optics). Zero mean pressure difference across the meniscus was maintained by a slow hydraulic\nleak to an outside reservoir, which equalised internal and external pressures at frequencies much lower than\nthe photothermal modulation frequency. This ensured that, on average, the meniscus was flat.\nA piezoelectric element on the side of the cell was used to modulate the cell volume for test purposes\n(Morgan Matroc PZT-5A, 0.48mm thick, 10mm square, bonded to a 6mm diameter hole in the cell wall).\nApplying a voltage across the cell PZT resulted in a large meniscus deflection, whose magnitude was\nproportional to the applied voltage.\n3.2 Interrogation of the meniscus by fibre optic interferometry\nThe apparatus used to measure vertical meniscus deflection is shown in Figure 2. The interferometer cavity\nwas formed by (a) the end of a cleaved optical fibre, and (b) the centre of the meniscus. In order to\neliminate back-reflections from other fibre endfaces, fibre ferrules were polished at an angle of 12\uf0b0 to the\nnormal, and aligned at an angle of 6\uf0b0 to the optical path[11]. The photodiode at (2) was connected to a\ntransimpedance amplifier.\nFigure 2. Low finesse fibre Fabry-Perot interferometer, used to detect the relative position of the meniscus\nPhase quadrature was maintained using a piezoelectric bimorph element (Quantelec EB-T-320, 15mm \uf0b4\n1.5mm \uf0b4 0.6mm) to change the vertical position of the cleaved end of the optical fibre (4). A slow\nfeedback control loop, with a time constant of approximately 0.2s, applied a variable voltage to the bimorph\nin order to maintain a fixed voltage output from the detector, mechanically tracking an interference fringe\nedge. The voltage setpoint was adjusted manually at the beginning of each experiment. A distance of\napproximately 60\u00b5m was maintained between the fibre end and the meniscus to avoid accidental contact\nbetween the two.\n3.3 Acoustic isolation\nThe noise floor for the interferometer was found to be below 1 pm Hz-1\/2, measured with the cleaved fibre\nend over a silica test plate bonded next to the meniscus. However, the minimum detectable meniscus\ndeflection was determined by environmental acoustic noise in the laboratory. An isolation chamber, shown\nin Figure 3, was used to reduce the level of acoustic noise transmitted through the air and through the\nground \/ laboratory bench. The chamber reduced the magnitude of the noise voltage signals measured with\nthe optical fibre \/ meniscus by a factor of approximately 100, for frequencies between 100 and 500Hz. The\nresulting noise floor for the interferometer, in the region from 70 Hz to 120 Hz, was approximately\n10 pm Hz-1\/2, which was believed to be determined by fluctuations of the meniscus rather than the fibre.\n4Figure 3. Acoustic isolation chamber, used for photothermal experiments.\n3.4 System configuration\nTwo light sources were used for our experiments. The first was a collimated 678nm laser diode module\n(Vector Technology Beta TX, 3mW) with integral driver, which was modulated by applying a square-wave\nvoltage from a signal generator (Thurlby Thandar model TG220).\nThe second light source was a mercury discharge lamp (Spectronics Spectroline 11SC-1), normally driven\nat mains frequency via its proprietary driver (Spectroline SCT 1A\/F). Variable frequency operation was\nachieved by connecting the output from the signal generator to a power amplifier (ILP SMOS 248), and\nusing a transformer (Intram Barwell MF100) to provide the 230V required by the Spectroline lamp driver.\n100% modulation was achieved for an applied sinusoidal voltage at frequencies of f>30Hz. The lamp\nintensity was modulated essentially as a rectified sine wave, the majority of the modulation occurring at 2f.\nStray light from the lamp was reduced by covering the mercury tube with aluminium foil, apart from a 3mm\naperture from which light was coupled into the cell using a high NA lens. A UV-enhanced photodiode was\nbonded over a second small hole in the foil and used to monitor the relative emission intensity from the\nlamp. A shutter was placed in front of the lamp, to allow it to warm up without exposing solutions in the\ncell to UV light, reducing the possibility of photobleaching.\nThe emitted powers of both light sources were estimated using a large area UV-enhanced silicon\nphotodiode (Centronic OST100\/7CQ). The photodiode current was related to the incident light intensity\nusing the manufacturer\u2019s quoted responsivity at each wavelength, with an estimated absolute error of 15%.\nThe quoted responsivity at 780nm was checked using a commercial fibre optic power meter (Megger OTP\n510, also incorporating a silicon photodiode).\nThe UV lamp was modulated at a frequency of f=57.5Hz (2f=115Hz). The 2f-modulated 254nm light\npower, transmitted into the cell, was estimated to be 0.30\uf0b10.05 mW rms. The output from the 678nm laser\ndiode was estimated to be 1.4\uf0b10.2 mW rms, for square wave modulation at 115 Hz.\nThe configuration of the system is shown in Figure 4. Signals from the interferometer receiver were\ndetected synchronously using a lock-in amplifier (EG&G model 5210, 0.5 Hz - 110 kHz), in R,\uf071mode with\na 100s time constant. For one series of experiments, the two light sources were used simultaneously. A\nsecond signal generator of the same type was used, with a lock-in amplifier which was similar to the first\n(EG&G model 5110, 0.5 Hz-100 kHz), used in the same operating mode.\n5Figure 4. Schematic diagram of system components for photothermal detection.\n3.5 Experimental procedure\nThe cell was filled with a test solution and the interferometer aligned by eye to the centre of the meniscus\nusing an xyz stage. A sinusoidal voltage of approximately 10V peak-to-peak was applied to the cell PZT,\nin order to modulate the cell volume and thereby the height of the centre of the meniscus. The resulting\nfringes from the interferometer were displayed on an oscilloscope and used to align the fibre more\nprecisely, to the position of maximum meniscus movement. The interference fringes also were used to\ndetermine the correct quadrature setpoint for the phase controller.\nPhotoacoustic signals have a strong temperature dependence in water, which is approximately linear over\nour working range (23-25\uf0b0C), and falls to zero at 4\u00b0C [12]. The ambient temperature was measured for each\nresult and used as a normalising factor. It was assumed that the KMnO4 solutions had reached thermal\nequilibrium with the surroundings, and that any temperature increase during each measurement was\nnegligible. Also measured was the sinusoidal voltage required across the cell PZT to cause the meniscus to\nmove by two whole interference fringes (780nm). This voltage was inversely proportional to the\nresponsivity of the cell to volume changes, and was used as a normalising factor to correct for possible\nchanges in the surface tension of the fluid.\n4 Results and discussion\nThe absorption spectra of aqueous solutions of anthracene and KMnO4, measured using the diode array\nspectrometer with a 4cm pathlength cell, are shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6. The emission spectra of the\nlaser diode and the mercury lamp, also measured using the spectrometer, have been superimposed. Many\nPAHs, including anthracene, are known to be unstable to high intensity UV light[13], but no evidence of UV\nphotolysis of our samples, which would have been evident as photobleaching, was observed during our\nexperiments. The emission of the 678nm laser diode corresponds to a region of relatively low absorption\nby the KMnO4. However, we were not primarily interested in detecting trace levels of KMnO4, but in\ncharacterising the system in terms of detectable absorption coefficients, otherwise a different wavelength\nmight have been chosen.\n6200 250 300 350 400 450\n0\n0.01\nwavelength \/ nm\nab\nso\nrp\ntio\nn\nco\nef\nf.\n\/c\nm\n-1 0.02\n500\nFigure 5.

Absorption spectrum of 17ppm KMnO4 in aqueous solution, taken against a deionised water\nblank. Inset: Expanded scale, with superimposed emission spectrum of the red laser diode (arbitrary\nunits, dashed line).\nBeer\u2019s law states that the absorbed light intensity is equal to\n\uf028 \uf029\uf06c\uf061\uf02d\uf02d\uf03d 1010II (1)\nwhere I0 is the incident light intensity, \uf06c is the pathlength in cm, and \uf061 is absorption coefficient of the fluid,\nin cm-1. The absorption coefficients of different constituents of a solution are additive. At low levels of\nconcentration (low \uf061) the intensity of absorbed light, and therefore the photothermal signal, is expected to\nbe a linear function of the total absorption coefficient of the solution. The predicted responsivity of\nphotothermal meniscus deflection is calculated in the Appendix, as is the expected magnitude of the\nresulting signal which would be detected by the interferometer receiver.\n4.1 Detection of potassium permanganate\nThe relative concentrations of the KMnO4 samples were checked by measuring their absorption at 678nm,\nusing the diode array spectrometer. The absorptions of the weakest solutions were too low for accurate\nmeasurements, so their concentrations were deduced from the measured value at 530nm, which\ncorresponded to an absorption maximum.\nThe results for a range of solution concentrations are plotted in Figure 7 (a), versus the concentration of\nKMnO4 in ppm by weight. At high absorptions (approaching \uf061=1) the signals showed a non-linear\nresponse, as expected from Beer\u2019s law. At low levels of KMnO4, the signals reached a plateau\ncorresponding to the background level of water absorption; the mean measured photothermal signal for\ndeionised water control samples is shown as a dashed line.\n7(a)\nKMnO4\nwater\n(mean)\nwater (1\uf073)\n103\n10\n30\n100\n300\nKMnO4\nm\nen\nis\ncu\nsd\nef\nle\nct\nio\nn\n\/p\nm\n1 2 3 4\n0\n10\n20\n[KMnO4] \/ ppm\nm\nen\nis\ncu\nsd\nef\nle\nct\nio\nn\n\/p\nm\n0 5\n(b)\n0.1 1 10 100\n[KMnO4] \/ ppm\n10-3 0.01\nFigure 7. Photothermal rms meniscus deflection excited by a 678nm laser diode. (a) Original data (b)\nThe same data following subtraction of the mean measurement for water.\nSubtraction of the mean signal due to water gives a linear dependence on KMnO4 concentration at low\nconcentrations above the noise level, as shown in Figure 7 (b). The minimum detectable concentration of\nKMnO4 (SNR=1) is approximately 0.5ppm. This corresponds to an additional absorption coefficient due to\nthe KMnO4 of 4\uf0b410-4cm-1 (estimated using the diode array spectrometer) for which the absorbed power\nfrom the laser diode over 5cm would be 6\uf0b11 \uf06dW rms. At 678nm, the absorption due to water is expected to\nbe 1.8\uf0b410-3cm-1 [3]. The repeatability of the technique (one standard deviation) is therefore approximately\n20% at 678nm.\n4.2 Photothermal detection of anthracene\nIn the case of anthracene, the concentrations of the strongest solutions were calculated by comparing the\nmeasured absorption with the known literature value of the molar extinction coefficient, 2\uf0b4105cm-1mol-1litre\nat the 252nm peak[14]. The absorption coefficients of the weakest solutions were too low to be measured\nwith the diode array spectrometer and so the concentrations were deduced from their dilution history. The\nabsorption of anthracene at 254nm was estimated to be approximately 75% of that at the peak wavelength.\nBecause the absorption coefficient of water at 254nm is relatively high (7\uf0b410-3cm-1 [15]), some additional\ndiscrimination was needed of the relatively small signal due to anthracene. Self-referencing was achieved\nby simultaneously measuring the photothermal signals due to 678nm excitation (at f2=69Hz) and 254nm\nexcitation (at f1=115Hz). The additional absorption at 678nm due to anthracene was negligible for all the\nsolutions tested.

(b) The same data following subtraction of the mean ratio for water.\nThese results indicate that our technique may be used to detect anthracene, in aqueous solution, at levels\ndown to approximately 2ppb (SNR=1). This corresponds to an absorption coefficient, due to anthracene\nalone, of approximately 1.7\uf0b410-3cm-1 at 254nm. The expected absorption coefficient of deionised water at\n254nm is 7\uf0b410-3cm-1 [3]. Thus, the repeatability of the measurement (one standard deviation) is\napproximately 20% using the self-referencing technique.\n4.3 Investigation of alternative meniscus radii\nThe apparatus was used to test the prediction of the Appendix, that the response to energy absorption, or\nindeed to any applied volume change within the cell, would be maximised by using a meniscus radius of\n200\uf06dm. The effect of the meniscus size on the magnitude of meniscus displacement was investigated using\ntwo different methods.\nThe most important measure of response was the magnitude of the photothermal signal with a known\nabsorber. A solution of 500ppm KMnO4 was used, with an absorption coefficient of approximately\n0.03cm-1 at 678nm, absorbing approximately 30% of the incident light over the 5cm path.\nA second method involved using the cell PZT to apply standard volume changes to the cell, resulting in\nmeniscus deflections that were proportional to the voltage applied to the PZT. This method had the\nadvantage of producing a significantly larger meniscus deflection signal than the photothermal method. A\nlarge signal was needed because environmental noise resulted in excessively large low-frequency\nundulations of the largest meniscus tested. The cell PZT method correlated well with the photothermal\nmeasurements over a range of cell sensitivities, as shown in Figure 9. Therefore, this PZT method could\nreliably be used to establish the variation in system response with changing meniscus size. The responsivity\n9of the cell, tested in this manner, has been expressed as the magnitude of the meniscus deflection per unit\napplied volt across the PZT.\n0 20 40 60 80\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\nSensitivity to PZT \/ nm V-1\nPh\not\noa\nco\nus\ntic\nsi\ngn\nal\n\/p\nm\nFigure 9. Correlation of two measures of system responsivity \u2013 the rms photothermal meniscus\ndeflection, and the response of the system to applied sinusoidal voltages across the cell PZT. A straight\nline confirms that the latter may be used as a characteristic measure of system responsivity.\nMeasurements of system response, using the cell PZT method, are plotted in Figure 10 for menisci with\ndifferent radii. Also plotted is the normalised dependence on meniscus size predicted by equation (12).\nThe experimental data show a reasonable agreement with theory. Figure 10 implies that the optimum\nmeniscus radius should lie between 200\uf06dm and 400\uf06dm, which would be consistent with the cell being more\ncompliant than has been assumed. However, our choice of a 200\uf06dm meniscus, from a limited number of\npossibilities, remains the best.\n10 100 103\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\nexperimental\npredicted\nmeniscus radius \/ \uf06dm\nse\nns\niti\nvi\nty\nto\nPZ\nT\n\/n\nm\nV\n-1\nFigure 10. Optimum value of the meniscus radius determined by experiment, and the normalised prediction.\n5 Conclusion\nWe have devised, constructed and tested a novel closed cell system for photothermal measurements of\noptical absorption in liquids. The system was tested with aqueous solutions of potassium permanganate,\nexcited at 678nm using a laser diode, and with anthracene, excited at 254nm using a mercury discharge\nlamp. High sensitivity was achieved despite the use of low power, cw sources, potentially extending the\napplicability of photothermal \/ photoacoustic methods to low cost systems.\nWe overcame a number of constraints imposed by such light sources. The photothermal signal was small,\nand would be difficult to detect using traditional techniques involving piezoelectric microphones. Our\n10\nnovel pressure transducer involved a water meniscus acting as a highly compliant diaphragm, its deflection\ndetected using fibre optic interferometry. The optimum radius for the meniscus gave it a compliance equal\nto the bulk compliance of the enclosed water. The signal to noise ratio of the photothermal measurements\nwas enhanced by an acoustic suppression chamber, which reduced the level of ambient environmental\nacoustic noise. The limiting noise for the system was believed to be due to random fluctuations of the centre\nof the meniscus.\nThe ultimate sensitivity of the technique was limited by the background absorption of the deionised water\nsolvent, expected to be 7\uf0b410-3cm-1 [15] at 254nm and 1.8\uf0b410-3cm-1 [3] at 678nm. Subtracting a blank\nreference from the measured signal reduced the minimum detectable absorption coefficient, due to the\nanalyte alone, to 4\uf0b410-4cm-1 at 678nm (SNR=1), corresponding to 0.5ppm potassium permanganate. For\n254nm measurements of anthracene absorption, a simultaneous reference signal was excited at a second\nwavelength not absorbed by anthracene. This compensated for the residual absorption of water to give a\nminimum detectable absorption coefficient of 1.7\uf0b410-3cm-1 at 254nm, corresponding to 2ppb anthracene.\nWe do not appear to have encountered photoacoustic window noise, but it may have been hidden by the\nrelatively high absorption of the water itself.\nAppendix \u2013 theory of operation\nWe wish to establish the relationship between the deflection of the centre of the meniscus, \uf044h, and the light\nenergy absorbed by the aqueous analyte in the cell. The meniscus is shown in cross-section in Figure 11.\nThe following assumptions have been made;\n(i) The presence of trace chemicals in the water has a negligible effect on its thermal and mechanical\nproperties, and those properties are unchanged (eg due to photothermal temperature increases)\nthroughout the experiments.\n(ii) A flat meniscus is used for detection purposes, with small deflections from this equilibrium.\n(iii) The curvature of the meniscus is constant across the pinhole, ie surface forces dominate gravity and\ndeflections are spherical.\n(iv) The edge of the pinhole is perfectly sharp (zero radius of curvature).\n(v) The pinhole can support any contact angle of fluid (real equilibrium contact angles would impose\nlimits of applicability to the analysis).\nFigure 11. Cross-section of a liquid meniscus, at the edge of a small cylindrical orifice.\nFirstly, the mechanical compliance of the cell is calculated, ie the change in volume caused by an internal\npressure change. This is used to calculate the magnitude of the photothermal response, and the optimum\nvalue of the meniscus radius is found. Finally, the magnitude of the signal from the fibre optic\ninterferometer is calculated.\n11\nCell compliance\nThe compliances (\uf0b6V\/\uf0b6P) of different cell elements are additive, and may be considered one by one. The\ncompliance of the water enclosed by the cell may be calculated from the definition of its bulk modulus \uf06b\n(2 \uf0b4 10-9 Pa [16]) and the internal volume of the cell Vc.\n\uf06b\ncV=\nP\nV\nwater\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6 (5)\nThe compliance of the meniscus may be found as follows. The excess pressure across the surface of the\nliquid is given by the equation;\na\nP \uf071\uf067 cos2=\uf044 (6)\nwhere \uf067 is the surface tension of the fluid (73 \uf0b4 10-3 N m-1 [17]). The meniscus compliance is lowest when \uf071\n= \uf070\/2 and the meniscus is flat, which might at first appear surprising, because the excess pressure across an\nalmost flat meniscus must be minimal. However, the displaced volume in this situation is also minimal,\ngiving a low but non-zero value of the compliance. For small deflections from a flat surface, the meniscus\ncompliance is approximately linear with respect to \uf071, and the expression converges to the following;\n\uf067\n\uf070\n8\n4\nmeniscus\na=\nP\nV\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\n(7)\nThe total compliance of each of the cell windows and of the cell PZT, due to outward bending, may be\ncalculated using deflection equations given by Timoshenko and Woinowsky-Krieger[18], with the following\nresult.\n\uf028 \uf0291\n16\n2\n3\n6\nwindow\n\uf02d\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\n\uf06e\n\uf070\ntY\na\n=\nP\nV w (8)\naw is the unsupported radius of the windows or PZT, t is the thickness, Y is the Young\u2019s modulus and \uf06e the\nPoisson\u2019s ratio. The total combined compliance of 2mm thick, 10mm radius sapphire windows and a\n0.48mm thick, 3mm radius wafer of PZT-5A was estimated to be less than 1% of the compliance of the\nwater and the meniscus, and therefore could not significantly affect the magnitude of the photothermal\nresponse.\nThe total compliance of the cell is then the sum of all the significant individual compliances of the cell\ncomponents, including the water contained within it, and is given by\n\uf067\n\uf070\n\uf06b 8\n4a\n+\nV\n=\nP\nV c\n\uf0b6\n\uf0b6\n(9)\nPhotothermal response\nWhen a cylindrical region of fluid lying in the optical path absorbs a small amount of light energy \uf064E, its\nunconstrained volume increase would be,\n\uf072\n\uf064\uf062\n\uf064\nC\nEV\np\n\uf03d (10)\nwhere \uf062 is the volume thermal expansion coefficient of the fluid (207 \uf0b4 10-6 K-1 [16]), Cp is its specific heat\ncapacity (4.18 J g-1K-1 [17]) and \uf072 is its density. The pressure increase in a closed cell on absorption of\nenergy \uf064E is thus given by equation (10) and the total cell compliance.\nIt is proposed to measure the pressure increase in the cell by detecting the height change of the centre of the\nmeniscus, \uf044h. The displacement of the flat meniscus from its mean position is a function of the excess\npressure across it, which for small pressure changes approximates to the following linear expression;\n12\n\uf0674\n2 Pa\n=h\n\uf044\n\uf044 (11)\nThe response is a minimum for a flat meniscus, therefore we could increase the response by operating away\nfrom this point. However, by operating near the origin we should gain stability and linearity. Substitution\ngives the responsivity of meniscus deflection to absorbed energy.\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02b\n\uf0b6\n\uf044\uf0b6\n\uf067\n\uf070\n\uf06b\n\uf067\uf072\n\uf062\n8\n4aV\n1\nC4\na=\nE\nh\ncp\n2\n(12)\nFor any given cell size (which would preferably be as small as practically possible), there is an optimum\nvalue of a which maximises the response. At this radius, the meniscus compliance is equal to that of the\nwater enclosed by the cell.\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf070\uf06b\n\uf067 V\n=a c\n8 4\n1\noptimum (13)\nFor a cell containing pure water of volume Vc = 1.6\uf0b410-5 m3, the optimum meniscus radius predicted by\nequation (13) is 200\uf06dm. The overall responsivity to photothermal energy absorption then becomes;\n14 Jm104 \uf02d\uf02d\uf0b4\n\uf0b6\n\uf044\uf0b6 =\nE\nh (14)\nDetection of meniscus movement by fibre optic interferometry\nWe used a low-finesse Fabry-Perot interferometer, formed by the centre of the water meniscus and the\ncleaved end of a single mode fibre. Santos et al have analysed such a cavity[19], and concluded that for\nsmall reflectivities, a good approximation to a 2-beam or Fizeau interferometer can be made. Multiple\nreflections within the cavity are at a negligible level. If the amplitudes of the interfering beams are equal,\nthe intensity of the fringes is given by;\n\uf0fe\n\uf0fd\n\uf0fc\n\uf0ee\n\uf0ed\n\uf0ec\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02b\uf03d\n\uf06c\n\uf070 dKII 4cos10 (15)\nFor an air-filled Fizeau cavity formed by silica (the cleaved fibre end) and water, the amplitudes of the two\ninterfering beams will be slightly different, because the reflectivities of the two materials are dissimilar.\nHowever, in this case the resulting error is a small loss of fringe contrast rather than a change in fringe\nposition, and so it may be neglected. For small signals, at the maximum voltage gradient (phase\nquadrature), the voltage signal v may be converted to a displacement d using the formula;\nA\uf070\n\uf06c\n\uf064\uf064\n4\n.v=d (16)\nThe value of the scale factor A may be determined by observation of the full-height fringes formed by large\nchanges of optical phase.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by North West Water Ltd and by the EPSRC \/ Department of Trade and Industry,\nthrough the UK Teaching Company Scheme.\n13\nReferences\n[1] Rosencwaig A 1980 Photoacoustics and photoacoustic spectroscopy (New York: Wiley)\n[2] Pao Y-H 1977 Optoacoustic spectroscopy and detection (New York: Academic Press)\n[3] Patel C K N and Tam A C 1981 Pulsed optoacoustic spectroscopy of condensed matter Rev.
