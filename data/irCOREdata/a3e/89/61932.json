It has long been an enigma among basaltic \nLIPs. It was emplaced at about 183 Ma (Early Jurassic), during the emplacement of the \nadjacent Karoo LIP (Heimann et al. 1994; Encarnaci\u00f3n et al. 1996; Duncan et al. 1997; \nFleming et al. 1997; Minor & Mukasa 1997; Riley & Knight 2001). It forms an elongate \noutcrop that is over 3 500 km long by only some 160 km wide (Fig. 1) (Elliot & Fleming \n2004), which is unusual among LIPs  \u2013 however, the extent to which the elongate outcrop is a \nfunction of ice cover limiting its outcrop is uncertain. Its main outcrops are in Antarctica (Kyle \n1980; Kyle et al. 1981; Elliot & Fleming 2004), but it also occurs in southeast Australia, (Hergt \net al. 1989, 1992) New Zealand (Mortimer et al. 1995), and probably South Africa also (Riley \net al. 2005). Its volume can be estimated to be around 200 000 km3, allowing 60 000 km3 for \nthe Dufek-Forrestal intrusions, 125 000 km3 for sills lavas and dykes in Antarctica, and 15 000 \nkm3 for sills in Tasmania (Hergt et al. 1989a; Elliot & Fleming 2000). This is a considerable \nreduction from early estimates of 500 000 km3 (e.g. Kyle et al. 1981), the difference being a \nreduction in the interpreted size of the Dufek and Forrestal intrusions (Ferris et al. 1998).   \n \nThe Ferrar LIP is volumetrically overwhelmingly dominated by monotonous low-Ti tholeiitic \nbasalt with noticeably arc-like trace elements characteristics, with no trace of normal \nasthenospheric or mantle plume-derived compositions, except for a few lamprophyres that \nappear to have been derived from HIMU plume mantle (Leat et al. 2000; Riley et al. 2003), \nand an almost exclusively lithospheric mantle source of the basalts has been strongly favoured \n(Kyle, 1980; Hergt et al. 1991; Molzahn et al. 1996; Hergt & Brauns 2001). Suggestions for \nwhy the Ferrar LIP erupted in its linear form have tended to emphasize either the extensional \nnature of the rift-like structure along which the magmas intruded (Storey et al. 1992; Elliot \n1992; Wilson 1993) or a linear melting (possible heat) anomaly perhaps related to the \n 3\nproximity to a long-lived subduction zone on the Gondwana margin (Cox 1988, 1992; Storey \n1995).  \n \nIt is not the purpose of this paper to review all the geochemical evidence for the origin of the \nFerrar province. However, two features of the Ferrar basalts are important to debate of their \nemplacement mechanisms. The first is that they are very homogeneous in composition (once \nthe effects of essentially closed-system fractional crystallization are take into account). This \nhomogeneity is evident whether comparisons are made between lavas or sills in one location, \nor compositions are compared across the province as a whole. This feature of the province was \nnoted by Kyle (1980), Kyle et al. (1983), Hergt et al. (1989b, 1991), Fleming et al. (1992, \n1995) and Hergt & Brauns (2001). The one significant exception to this is the chemical \ndivision of the Ferrar LIP into two chemical groups, as discussed below. The second feature is \nthat they have compositions that indicate that they were derived from a modified source in the \nlithospheric mantle. Given the homogeneous nature of the magmas, this would imply that the \nlithospheric sources were homogeneous over a distance of at least 3 700 km, if the magmas are \nenvisaged to have risen more-or-less vertically from their mantle sources. Because of the \ninherently heterogeneous composition of lithospheric mantle (Hawkesworth et al. 1984; \nGibson et al. 1995; Pearson & Nowell 2002), this is unlikely. The Ferrar crosses a significant \nlithospheric boundary between the Theron Mountains \u2013 Shackleton Range parts of its \ndistribution (Late Proterozoic crust) and the Transantartic Mountains \u2013 southeast Australia \nparts (Early Palaeozoic terranes). This lithospheric boundary is reflected in the compositions of \nother lithosphere-derived mafic igneous rocks (Leat et al. 2005), but does not correspond to \nany significant change in Ferrar compositions, showing that regional lithosphere compositions \ndid not affect Ferrar magma compositions.    \n \nBecause of the unsatisfactory nature of models involving vertical rise of Ferrar magmas, \nseveral authors have, in recent years, suggested that they were emplaced by a lateral flow \nmechanism of magma though continental crust (Storey & Kyle, 1997; Elliot et al. 1999; Elliot \n& Fleming 2000, 2004; Ferris et al. 2003; Riley et al. 2005; Leat et al. 2006). Lateral flow \nmodels can maintain the lithosphere-derived geochemical models, but explain the homogeneity \nof the LIP by origin of all the magmas from one point source.  \n \nIf correct, this is the greatest distance in any volcanic event on Earth that magmas are thought \nto have flowed laterally as intrusions through the crust. The evidence for lateral flow of the \nFerrar magmas is itself largely geochemical. This paper reviews the state of this geochemical \nevidence, and finds the evidence to be robust. \n \nChemical types of Ferrar magmas \nThe Ferrar LIP is chemically distinct from the contemporaneous Karoo LIP. Ferrar \ncompositions are closest to the low-Ti magmas of the Karoo, particularly those found in the \nCentral Area (Marsh et al. 1997). The main distinguishing features are Sr and Nd isotopes: \nFerrar basalts have initial 87Sr\/86Sr ratios of  >0.708 (\u03b5Sr183=53), and \u03b5Nd183 values of  >-7.0 \n(Faure & Elliot 1971; Kyle 1980; Kyle et al. 1983; Hergt et al. 1989a) \u2013 no Karoo rocks fall in \nthis range.     \n \nThe \u2018type locality\u2019 for the Ferrar LIP is Victoria Land, Antarctica. The basaltic lava sequences \nin the area, the Kirkpatrick Basalts, comprise two distinct chemical types. The volumetrically \ndominant type that forms the lower part of the sequence has relatively low Si, Ti, Fe and K and \nis called Mount Fazio Chemical Type (MFCT). The upper lavas belong to a different, high Si, \nTi, Fe and Ti group called the Scarab Peak Chemical Type (SPCT) (Fleming et al. 1995, 1999; \nElliot et al. 1999). The SPCT is isotopically similar to the low-87Sr\/86Sr members of the \n 4\nMFCT, to which they are thought to be related by fractional crystallisation (Fleming et al. \n1995, 1999; Elliot et al. 1999).  \n \nRepresentative analyses of MFCT and SPCT from parts of the Ferrar LIP are presented in \nTables 1 & 2. The analyses are taken from the literature, with the exception of the new \nanalyses from Pensacola Mountains. Inevitably, there are differences in quality resulting from \ndifferent analytical techniques and interlab errors. Nd and Sr isotope data are recalculated to \ninitial values at 183 Ma.  \n \nDistribution of Ferrar magmas \nThe distribution of MFCT and SPCT are critical to the evidence for lateral flow models of the \nFerrar. Their distribution in Antarctica is shown in Fig. 2. Ferrar sills and lavas are spatially \nclosely associated with the Beacon Supergroup and its correlatives (Table 1; Fig. 1). The \nBeacon Supergroup is a generally flat-lying basin-filling sequence of Devonian to Early \nJurassic siliciclastic sedimentary rocks that crops out in the Transantarctic Mountains and \nVictoria Land, Antarctica, where it unconformably overlies Ordovician and older rocks \n(Barrett 1991). It has widespread correlatives in Antarctica, and in Tasmania and New Zealand. \nIt is also correlated with Karoo Supergroup of Southern Africa. The entire basin fill is thickest \nin the southern Africa area (locally over 10 km; Johnson et al. 1996), thinning across \nAntarctica, where the Beacon Supergroup is 2.5 km thick (Barrett 1991), toward Australia (1 \nkm thick in Tasmania; Hergt et al. 1989a) (Table 1).  \n \nSouthern Africa \nThe Karoo province of southern Africa is overwhelmingly chemically distinct from the Ferrar, \nbut a few Ferrar-like low-Ti compositions have been identified: (1) The low-Ti lavas of the \nCentral Area (in and around Lesotho) are the Karoo lavas most similar to Ferrar compositions \n(Marsh et al. 1997). Elliot & Fleming (2000) suggested that the Golden Gate lavas, within the \nCentral Area, might represent magmas derived form the same source as the Ferrar magmas. \nThe Central Area basalt lavas are dated by Ar-Ar and U-Pb as being about the same age as the \nFerrar province (Encarnaci\u00f3n et al. 1996; Duncan et al. 1997). The Golden Gate lavas have \n\u03b5Sr183 values of 52.9 to 65.0 (Marsh et al. 1997), at the low end of the Ferrar range, and \u03b5Nd183 \nvalues similar to Ferrar basalts (Elliot & Fleming 2000). However, elementally they are not \nidentical to Ferrar, for example they have higher TiO2 abundances (1.00 \u2013 1.07 wt.%; Marsh et \nal. 1997). (2) Riley et al. (2006) suggested that some basaltic dykes, within a group of mainly \nnorthwest-southeast trending dykes around Underberg, KwaZulu-Natal, emplaced between the \nCentral Area lavas and the rifted margin, are Ferrar correlatives. The most Ferrar-like dyke \n(sample SA.3.1) gave an Ar-Ar plateau age of 176.36\u00b11.23 Ma on plagioclase (Riley et al. \n2006), close to dates for the Ferrar in Antarctica. Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) \ndata for the dykes indicate that magma flow in most was lateral, with flow from southeast to \nnorthwest dominating (Riley et al. 2006). Sample SA.3.1 is similar to the Antarctic MFCT \ngroup (Table 1), and has a \u03b5Sr183 value of 66.3 and a \u03b5Sr183 value of \u20133.8 (Riley et al. 2006).  \n \nTheron Mountains \nThe Theron Mountains (Fig. 3) is a 110 km long escarpment, up to 760 m high, which exposes \nhorizontal terrestrial sedimentary deposits intruded, mostly conformably, by basalt sills and \nrare dykes (Brook 1972; Leat et al. 2006). The sedimentary rocks contain coal horizons, and a \nGlossopteris flora indicates a Permian age (Brook 1972). The sills belong to several chemical \ntypes, similar to both the Ferrar and basalts of the Karoo province, and the Theron Mountains \nhave therefore been described as marking the overlap between the Ferrar and Karoo provinces \n(Brewer 1990; Brewer et al. 1992). The sills are all Jurassic in age, based on Ar-Ar dating and \ncross-cutting relationships (Brewer et al. 1996). Leat et al. (2006) showed that the sills form \nfour chemical types. Two types, probably represented by only one sill each, are similar to \n 5\nKaroo lavas of the Lebombo Monocline, South Africa and some dykes in Dronning Maud \nLand. The other two types are Ferrar-like. The most common type is MFCT-like (Table 1). \nThere are at least six sills of this type, ranging in thickness from 0.3 to 32 m. The forth type \nforms a single sill, some 200 m thick, and is SPCT in composition (Table 2). The MFCT-like \nsills have \u03b5Nd183 values of \u20133.7 to \u20135.0, and \u03b5Sr183 values in the range 55-75. The SPCT sill has \n\u03b5Nd183 values of \u20133.8 to \u20133.9 and \u03b5Sr183 values of 63 to 80 (Leat et al. 2006).  \n \nShackleton Range \nThe Shackleton Range is a large (200 x 70 km), apparently uplifted block of Proterozoic to \nEarly Palaeozoic rocks (Clarkson et al. 1995; Lisker et al. 1999). The rocks were deformed \nduring the Early Palaeozoic Ross orogeny, and the Range may mark a suture of the closed \nMozambique Ocean between East and West Gondwana (Tessensohn et al. 1999 - see also other \npapers from the EUOSHACK Project in the same volume of Terra Antartica). The youngest \nsedimentary rocks in the Range are the Ordovician Blaiklock Glacier Group (Buggish & \nHenjes-Kunst 1999). There are no exposed sedimentary rocks in the Range equivalent to the \nBeacon Supergroup. \n \nDespite the extensive outcrop of the Shackleton Range, which exposes many dykes that are \nmainly of Proterozoic and Palaeozoic age (Hofmann et al. 1980; Clarkson 1981; Hotten 1993, \n1995; Spaeth et al. 1995; Techmer et al. 1995; Leat et al. 2005), only four Jurassic dykes have \nbeen identified. Using the dyke numbering system of Spaeth et al. (1995), these are dykes 16a \nand 16b from Mount Beney, Lagrange Nunataks (may be continuations of the same dyke: these \nare also equivalents of samples Z.726.1 and Z.726.4 of Clarkson 1981), dyke 25 from Mount \nSkidmore, Legrange Nunataks (may be equivalent to dyke 8 of Hofmann et al. 1980), and dyke \n17 from Mount Provender Haskard Highlands. All these are from the northern part of the \nShackleton Range.  \n \nDykes 16a, 16b and 25 have been dated by whole-rock, plagioclase and pyroxene K-Ar with all \nages falling in the range 176.6\u00b14.7 to 182.9\u00b111.3 Ma and are clearly Jurassic (Hotten 1993). \nDyke 17 is assigned to the same group on compositional grounds (Spaeth et al. 1995: Techmer \net al. 1995). The dykes were assigned to the Ferrar magma type by previous authors (e.g. \nSpaeth et al. 1995; Techmer et al. 1995). I further identify the Jurassic dykes as MFCT \nmagmas (Table 1).   \n \nWhichaway Nunataks \nThe Whichaway Nunataks expose a flat-lying, sandstone-dominated sedimentary sequence \n(Whichaway Formation) conformably intruded by basalt sills (Omega dolerites) (Stephenson \n1966; Brewer 1989). The sedimentary sequence contains a Glossopteris flora, and correlates \nwith the Beacon Supergroup. The contacts of the sills are poorly exposed or non-exposed. \nHowever, at least two sills are present and are > 50 m thick. A basaltic dyke cuts one of the \nsills. Hofmann et al. (1980) reported two whole-rock K-Ar ages of 163\u00b113 and 171\u00b114 Ma, \nwhich are interpreted as confirming a Jurassic age. The data presented by Stephenson (1966) \nand Brewer (1989) suggest that there is a low-Ti sill that crops out at about 840 m altitude in \nthe main nunatak group, and a high-Ti sill that outcrops at 1115-1310 m altitude in the main \nnunatak group and at Omega Nunatak, some 50 km to the south. The high-Ti sill has \u03b5Nd183 \nvalues of \u20131.9 to \u20133.3 and \u03b5Sr183 values of 83.9 to 85.4, and the low-Ti sill a \u03b5Nd183 value of \u2013\n3.4 and a \u03b5Sr183 value of 106.4 (Brewer et al. 1992).  \n \nBased on the geochemical data provided by Brewer (1989), I interpret the high-Ti sill to belong \nto the SPCT Ferrar group, and the low-Ti sill to belong to the MFCT Ferrar group (Table 1, 2).  \n \nPensacola Mountains \n 6\nThe Pensacola Mountains consist of probable Early Cambrian to Permian sedimentary \nsequences and interbedded igneous rocks deformed during several orogenic episodes, most \nimportantly the Ross event (Storey et al. 1996; Rowell et al. 2001; Curtis & Storey 2003).  The \nnorth of the mountain range is dominated by the Dufek and Forrestal gabbro intrusions, which \naccording to the geophysical interpretation of Ferris et al. (1998) together cover some 6 600 \nkm2 and are thought on grounds of composition and age to be part of the Ferrar intrusive \nepisode (Ford & Kistler 1980; Minor & Mukasa 1997).  \n \nJurassic minor intrusions are known to crop out at two places in the Pensacola Mountains: \nPecora Escarpment and Cordiner Peaks. At Pecora Escarpment, several sill leaves intrude \ngently dipping Permian sediments of the Pecora Formation. The sills were dated at 195\u00b15 Ma \nusing K-Ar determinations on pyroxenes and plagioclases (Ford & Kistler 1980). At least one \ndyke is reported from Rosser Ridge, Cordiner Peaks, intruding the Devonian Dover Sandstone \nand interpreted as Jurassic in age (Ford et al. 1978; Ford & Kistler 1980). Both Pecora \nEscarpment sills and Cordiner Peaks dyke were interpreted by Ford & Kistler (1980) to belong \nto the Ferrar Group on age and compositional grounds. Furthermore, the Cordiner Peaks is \ninterpreted to be part of a swarm of dykes associated with the Dufek and Forrestal intrusions \nthat have been imaged aeromagnetically (Ferris et al. 2003). Sr isotope data for a Pecora \nEscarpment sill and the Rosser Ridge dyke give \u03b5Sr183 values of 85 and 116 respectively (Ford \n& Kistler 1980). \n \nOur new analyses of the Rosser Ridge dyke and a Pecora Escarpment sill show that they both \nbelong to the MFCT group of Ferrar magmas (Table 1).  \n \nVictoria Land \nThe very extensive basaltic sills of Victoria Land are a prominent feature of this part of \nAntarctica. The sills are spectacularly exposed for 2 000 km in the Transantarctic Mountains \n(Kyle 1980; Kyle et al. 1981; Elliot & Fleming 2004). The sills intrude basement (Ordovician \nand older) and, more commonly, the near-flat-lying, Devonian to Jurassic Beacon Supergroup \n(Barrett 1991). The sills are thought to locally thicken to 2 km (Behrendt et al. 1995), and it is \nclear that the magma volume represented by the sills of Victoria Land is considerable \u2013 they \ncould underlie an area of 2x105 km2 and may represent a volume of 0.6-1.0x105 km3, a sizable \nproportion of the total volume of Ferrar sills in Antarctica (Elliott & Fleming 2000). Dykes are \nvolumetrically insignificant compared to the sills. The sills have been dated as Jurassic (183.6 \n\u00b1 1.0 by U-Pb on zircon and baddeleyite; Encarnaci\u00f3n et al. 1996), confirming Ar-Ar results \n(Fleming et al. 1997). Lavas forming the Kirkpatrick Basalts are the eruptive equivalent of the \nFerrar sills, with which they are contemporaneous, as dated by Ar-Ar (Heimann et al. 1994). \nThe Kirkpatrick Basalts are locally over 700 m thick and associated with phreatomagmatic \ndeposits that indicate local eruptions (Hanson & Elliot 1996). The sills and lavas are \ncompositionally very close. \u03b5Sr183 values for both are in the range 61-109, and \u03b5Nd183 values \nrange from \u20133.2 to \u20135.8 (Hergt et al. 1989b; Fleming et al. 1995: Molzahn et al. 1996; Elliot et \nal. 1999). As outlined above, the sills belong to the MFCT group, whereas both SPCT overlies \nMFCT chemical groups occur in the lavas \u2013 with SPCT always overlying MFCT in the lava \nsuccession (Fleming et al. 1992, 1995; Elliot et al. 1999; Elliot & Fleming 2004). \n \nSoutheast Australia \nJurassic dolerite sills outcrop over some 30 000 km2 in Tasmania, with a total volume of about \n15 000 km3, and intrude the flat-lying sedimentary Late Carboniferous to Triassic Parmeener \nSupergroup \u2013 a Beacon Supergroup equivalent (Hergt et al. 1989a). The sills are K-Ar dated at \n175\u00b18 (recalculated from Schmidt & McDougall 1977). The sills have \u03b5Nd183 values in the \nrange \u20135.2 to \u20136.6 and \u03b5Sr183 values ranging from 80 to 120 (Hergt et al. 1989a). \nCompositionally similar Jurassic basalts crop out in western Victoria (\u03b5Nd183 \u20135.2 to \u20135.6; \n 7\n\u03b5Sr183 81.0 to 83.2) and on Kangaroo Island, South Australia (\u03b5Nd183 \u20135.7 to \u20138.1; \u03b5Sr183 83.6 to \n98.7) (Hergt et al. 1991).  The Tasmanian dolerites have long been correlated with the Ferrar of \nVictoria Land (Hergt et al. 1989a; Brauns et al. 2000; Hergt & Brauns 2001). Hergt et al. \n(1991) made the same correlation for the western Victoria and Kangaroo Island basalts. All \nthese Australian basalts clearly belong to the MFCT group (Table 1).  \n \nNew Zealand \nThe Kiwans dolerite, a 1 km2 outcrop in South Island is the only Ferrar magma type identified \nin New Zealand (Mortimer et al. 1995). It intruded the Triassic Topfer Formation, thought to \nbe the only correlative of the Beacon Supergroup in New Zealand (Mortimer & Smale 1996). \nThe intrusion yielded Jurassic whole-rock K-Ar ages of up to 172.1\u00b12.2 Ma (Mortimer et al. \n1995). Four \u03b5Nd183 values for the dolerite range \u20135.3 to \u20135.4, with \u03b5Sr183 values ranging from \n84.2 to 91.4 (recalculated from Mortimer et al.  1995).  \n \nThe Kiwans dolerite belongs to the MFCT Ferrar group, based on its age, isotope composition, \nmajor and trace element abundances (Table 1), and association with a sedimentary sequence \ncorrelated with the Beacon Supergroup (Mortimer et al. 1995; Mortimer & Smale 1996).    \n \n \nDiscussion \nEvidence for lateral flow \nThe distribution of MFCT and SPCT within Antarctica is shown in Fig. 2. Note that the Ferrar \nis more widespread in Victoria Land than shown by the two stars. MFCT occurs in all known \noutcrops of the Ferrar LIP, from the Theron Mountains to Northern Victoria Land in \nAntarctica, and in Australia, probably South Africa, and New Zealand (not shown). The known \nlateral spread within Antarctica is 3 300 km. The Australian outcrops, adjacent to Northern \nVictoria Land in reconstructed Gondwana, add at least another 400 km. The homogeneity of \nthis magma group is strong evidence for long-distance lateral magma flow from a single \nsource. The likely source is at the Antarctica-Africa rifted margin (Elliot et al. 1999; Elliot and \nFleming 2000, 2004, and see below), some 400 km along the strike of the LIP from the Theron \nMountains, so the total distance the MFCT magmas flowed from source is at least 4 100 km \n(Fig. 3). Flow of MFCT magmas into southern Africa was only some 150 km.  \n \nSPCT magmas are known only as lavas in Northern and Southern Victoria Land and sills in the \nTheron Mountains and Whichaway Nunataks. The spread of the magma type nevertheless is \nalmost as great as that of the MFCT (Fig. 3). The SPCT extends over 3 300 km from the \nTheron Mountains to Northern Victoria Land, and must have travelled 3 700 km from the \nputative source in the rifted continental margin.  The exceptional distance of at least 4 100 km \nthat it is proposed that the Ferrar magmas travelled laterally can be related to the exceptional \nsize of the Gondwana continent, probably assisted by travel along an active rift zone, parallel \nto the subducting Pacific margin.   \n \nSource of the Ferrar magmas \nStorey & Kyle (1997) suggested that the Ferrar magmas flowed laterally away from magma \nchambers, like that represented by the Dufek intrusion, emplaced in crust up-domed by an \nunderlying \u2018megaplume\u2019 in the mantle of the South Atlantic region. Elliot et al. (1999) and \nElliot & Fleming (2000, 2004) put the source in a similar position, within the Antarctic-Africa \nrifted margin, close to the Explora anomaly, and within the region of the Weddell triple \njunction. The rifted margin between Antarctica and Africa was strongly magmatic during Early \nJurassic times. Along the Lebombo Monocline, a seaward-dipping lava sequence, the Karoo \nlavas are some 2.5 km thick (Sweeney et al. 1994). On the Antarctic margin, a prominent \n 8\nmagnetic anomaly, the Explora anomaly follows the continental edge (Fig. 4) and is interpreted \nas a seaward-dipping volcanic sequence, based on potential field and seismic interpretation \n(Kristoffersen & Hinz 1991; Hunter et al. 1996; Jokat et al. 1996; Leitchenkov et al. 1996; \nFerris et al. 2000). The Explora anomaly (also known as the Explora Wedge because of its \nseaward dipping reflectors) is interpreted as Jurassic by most authors (consistent with it being \nthe conjugate margin to the Lebombo Monocline, and with the widespread Jurassic magmatism \nin the area, while Cretaceous magmatism is minor), but Jokat et al. (2003) suggested a \nCretaceous age. The Filchner anomaly follows the projection of the Explora anomaly and is \nalso interpreted as basaltic intrusions or volcanics (Ferris et al. 2000). The Berkner Island \nanomaly follows this trend toward the Jurassic Dufek and Forrestal intrusions, and is likely to \nbe caused by basalt lavas and intrusions also. The Orion anomaly, a smaller Lozenge-shaped \nanomaly to the south, and the northwest margin (reconstructed orientation) of the Falkland \nIslands block (Figs. 4,5) are also interpreted as Jurassic rifted margin volcanic or intrusive \nsequences (Barker 1999; Ferris et al. 2000).  \n \nThe region where the Antarctic, Africa, Falkland Islands and Filchner microplate blocks rifted \napart during early Gondwana break-up was a zone of strongly magmatic rifted margin \nformation (Fig. 5). The rifted margins focus on the Weddell Sea triple junction, and most of the \nmagmatism is likely to Early Jurassic, approximately contemporaneous with the emplacement \nof the Karoo and Ferrar LIPs.  In Figs. 4 and 5, the strike of the Ferrar LIP, passing through the \nTheron Mountains, projects into the Explora anomaly, which is a plausible candidate for the \nsource area for the Ferrar LIP.   \n \nTransport mechanisms and geochemical relationships \nThe nature of the transport conduits for the flow of Ferrar magmas is a matter of conjecture, as \nno sills or dykes have been identified as feeders for long distance flow. The abundance of sills \nand paucity of dykes within the LIP makes a prima face case that the magmas were transported \nin sills, perhaps mainly emplaced into the Beacon Supergroup sediments, as proposed by \nStorey & Kyle (1997). Elliot et al. (1999) suggested that transport in dykes is more likely, as \nsill size is controlled by size of the host sedimentary basin. This mechanism is supported by the \nlateral emplacement of magma in giant dyke swarms such as the 2 000 km long Mackenzie \ndyke swarm, Canada (Baragar et al. 1996), and others on Earth, Venus and Mars that range up \nto 3 000 km long (Ernst et al. 2001). However, there is little evidence for the dyke swarm \nrequired to emplace the Ferrar LIP in this way. There is aeromagnetic evidence for limited \nFerrar dykes in the Pensacola Mountains associated with the Dufek-Forrestal intrusions (Ferris \net al. 2003), and even less outcrop evidence in the same area, where only one Ferrar dyke has \nbeen confirmed (see Pensacola Mountains). The evidence is no better in the Shackleton Range, \nan uplifted area some 60x170 km, which exposes (pre-Beacon Supergroup) basement. Only \nthree different Ferrar dykes have been positively identified (see Shackleton Range). There is no \nevidence for a Ferrar dyke swarm on the regional ADMAP aeromagnetic compilation \n(Golynsky et al. 2001). Regional aerogeophysical data sets in Victoria Land likewise fail to \nshow Ferrar dykes, although sills appear to be locally widespread (Ferraccioli & Bozzo 1999, \n2003). However, this may be because survey lines are too closely spaced to identify dykes of \nthe order of 10 m wide. The impression given is that any Ferrar feeder dyke swarm has, if it \nexists, proved very elusive; but detailed aeromagnetic surveys may yet find it. The close \nassociation of Ferrar sills with the Beacon Supergroup and its correlatives is fascinating. The \nFerrar sills closely follow the basin of the Beacon Supergroup, but are not found in parts of the \nbasin such as the Ellsworth Mountains and Falkland Islands that were affected by the Late \nPalaeozoic-Early Mesozoic Gondwanian orogeny (Fig. 1). As the Beacon Supergroup is \nthought to have formed a more-or-less continuous basin fill (Barrett, 1991) that was, in the \nareas unaffected by Gondwanian deformation, flat-lying at the time of emplacement of the \nFerrar LIP, and as the Ferrar is commonly observed in sills but rarely in dykes, the most likely \n 9\nmode of emplacement is within sills that propagated through the sedimentary basin. In this \nmodel, the sills would have initially intruded close to the thickest part of the sedimentary basin \nfill, and propagated to the thinner edge of the basin (Table 1; Fig. 1). \n \nTheoretical studies of emplacements of dykes indicate that magma flow distances of about 5 \n000 km can be achieved without freezing of magma, assuming normal dyke widths of  >10 m \nand moderate magma overpressure and a topographically high source magma chamber (such as \nwithin up-domed crust above a rising mantle plume) (Macdonald et al. 1988; Fialko & Rubin \n1999). The 200 000 km3 volume of magma represented by the Ferrar LIP was certainly to large \nto have been held in one magma chamber at one time, and batches of magma must have \nrepeatedly been expelled from one or more compositionally similar magma chambers. \nNumerous emplacement events are necessary to explain crosscutting relationships between \nMFCT sills in the Theron Mountains (author\u2019s unpublished observations) and Victoria Land \n(Elliot & Fleming 2004).  \n \nDuring flow of the magma away from the source, the magma is expected to become more \nevolved (by removal of phenocrysts), and more contaminated (as a result of assimilation of \nwall rocks). Examination of Tables 1 and 2 indicates that overall geochemical trends with \ndistance from the putative source are consistent with such a model. In the case of the MFCT \ngroup, all the analyses are similar, but show some variation, as would be expected if they \nrepresent numerous batches of magma. The South Africa dyke has slightly higher Ti\/Y and \nlower Zr\/Y and LaN\/YbN ratios than the other analyses, and the Kangaroo Island lava has \nrelatively high Ti\/Zr and LaN\/YbN ratios. However, both samples are sufficiently similar to the \nothers to be consistent with all the magmas being closely related. Mg# and MgO abundances \nare highest in the samples from the east of the province (left hand side of the table), being \nhighest in the South Africa, Theron Mountains and Shackleton Range samples, and lowest in \nthe Victoria Land and Tasmania samples from the west of the province. (Whichaway Nunatak \nis an exception to this trend, and a fractionated part of a large sill appears to have been \nsampled). These trends are consistent with fractional crystallisation having occurred during \nflow of magmas from a source near the Theron Mountains.  \n \nIn the SPCT group, all the analyses are remarkably similar, suggesting they are derived from a \nsmall number of very closely related magma batches, perhaps even just one intrusion\/eruption \nevent. Mg# and MgO abundances decline from east (Theron Mountains) to west (Victoria \nLand), as is the case with MFCT. Ti\/Y and Ti\/Zr ratios also fall from east to east, consistent \nwith removal of small about of Ti-bearing oxide phenocrysts during flow. Zr\/Y and LaN\/YbN \nratios are constant, within analytical errors, consistent with the incompatibility of these \nelements.    \n \nConclusions \nThe geochemical evidence from the Ferrar LIP is consistent with the lateral flow model, with a \nsource for the magmas in the rift that had developed between the African and Antarctic plates \nduring Early Jurassic times, during the break-up of Gondwana. The Ferrar LIP consists of two \ndistinct geochemical types. The volumetrically dominant Mount Fazio chemical type (MFCT) \nhas long been well known from Victoria Land and southeast Australia. It also occurs in the \nTheron Mountains, Shackleton Range, Whichaway Nunataks, Pensacola Mountains (all \nAntarctica), New Zealand and South Africa. The MFCT magmas flowed laterally through the \ncrust for distances of at least 4 100 km, the longest magma flow known on Earth. The Scarab \nPeak chemical type (SPCT) occurs as sills in the Theron Mountains and Whichaway Nunataks, \nand as lavas in Victoria Land, and flowed 3 700 km from its source. Geochemical data show \nthat the Mg# and MgO abundances of both MFCT and SPCT fall along the direction of magma \nflow from the Theron Mountains to Victoria Land (and Australia in the case of MFCT). Ti\/Y \n 10\nand Ti\/Zr ratios fall along the same trend in SPCT samples. These relationships are consistent \nwith fractional crystallisation occurring during the lateral flow of the magmas.  \n \nThe source of the magmas was in an area around the Weddell triple junction which potential \nfield and seismic data show was characterised by very abundant magmatism as Africa, \nAntarctica and several smaller plates rifted apart. The Ferrar province projects into the \nmagnetically defined Explora anomaly on the Antarctic continental margin, which is \ninterpreted on the basis of seismic reflection, magnetic and gravity data as a magmatic rifted \nmargin. Sills are very widely distributed over the province, mostly intruding flat-lying Beacon \nSupergroup sediments, but dykes are rare. A geophysically defined dyke swarm has not been \nidentified, but it is possible that future high-resolution aeromagnetic surveys may yet identify \none. Lateral flow was probably mainly in sills that propagated though the Beacon Supergroup \nsedimentary basin, but flow in dykes may also have been considerable.  \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe help of British Antarctic Survey logistics and staff for input to the Theron Mountains, \nWhichaway Nunataks and the Pensacola Mountains in the 1998-1999 field programme, and the \nUS Antarctic Program for input of fuel are gratefully acknowledged.
