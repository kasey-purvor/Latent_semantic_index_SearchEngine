It shows that most of that difference reflects the stronger desire of youths to have \nunions deal with workplace issues as compared to the exposure of youths to these issues.  \nPreferences for unionisation for youths more so than for adults are influenced by social factors \nsuch as familial union status and the attitudes of peers, as well as by the possible roles of \npotential substitutes for unionisation such as progressive HRM practices and legislative \nprotection.  Implications of the findings for the future of unionisation and the organising of youth \nare discussed. \n 1 \n1.  Introduction \n \nIt is often asserted that trade unions are outmoded institutions, unable to reach a new generation \nof workers imbued with individualistic values -- values that are at odds with the collective ethos \nunderpinning unionism (O\u2019Bannon 2001: 100-101).  These assertions attribute declines in union \nmembership that are occurring across most of the Western industrialised world to young people\u2019s \nreduced desire for union membership. These claims appear to be bolstered by the fact that the \nunionisation rate for young workers (those aged 15-24) is less than half than that of adult \nworkers (those aged 25+).  In particular, Britain, Canada, and the United States all display youth \nunionisation rates that are two and a half times lower than those of adult workers (Bryson et. al. \n2001: 17).    \nHowever, to establish that the labour movement\u2019s future is at risk because young people are \nturning their backs on unions, one has to establish two things: first, that the youth-adult \nunionisation differential is growing and, second, that this is due to a lower desire for membership \non the part of youths compared to adults.  Our empirical evidence for Canada contradicts both of \nthese claims.  Specifically, we find: (i) that the youth-adult union density differential, while \nrising slightly during the mid 1990s, remained constant throughout the decade; (ii) that the desire \nfor union membership is actually higher among youths than it is among adults in our sample and \n(iii) that most of that greater demand reflects the stronger desire of youths to have unions deal \nwith workplace issues, rather than the greater exposure of youths to these issues. \nOur first result clearly undermines  the main plank upon which the \u2018union-movement-is-\ndead\u2019 view rests its case.  Our second finding creates somewhat of a puzzle (since the actual \nunionisation rate is much lower for youths compared to adults), but it is entirely consistent with a \nqueuing model (Farber 1983:1421; 2001:17) of union membership determination in which \n 2 \nunions do not represent all individuals who prefer to be in a unionised job because the costs to \nboth individuals and unions of acquiring union status are unevenly spread across workers (e.g., \norganizing costs are greater for some segments of employees than for others).  Finally, our third \nfinding -- that predictors of desired unionisation display greater response elasticity for youth as \ncompared to adults \u2013 is compatible with a model where youth attitudes in general, and towards \nunion membership in particular, are relatively more malleable.  Consequently, determinants of \ndesired union membership, such as social capital and union voice procedures, should affect \nyoung workers to a greater extent than adults.  The reasons for these relationships are outlined in \ndetail later in the text. \nThe paper begins by examining unionisation rates for youths and adults in Canada.  Next, we \nturn to our specification of the determinants of preferences for unionisation, first setting out \ntheoretical considerations based on a comparison of economic and social psychological models \nof union attitude formation and then presenting our empirical model.  Youth-adult differences in \nthe factors that affect preferences for unionisation are then discussed.  The paper concludes with \na summary of the main findings and a discussion of the implications of these preference \ndifferences for unions and management.   \n \n2. Unionisation rates for youths and for adults \nUnion density rates in Canada have consistently been far lower for youths than for adults.  Table \n1 shows that in the decade of the 1990s, youth density ranged from almost one-half to one-third \nof the adult rate.  This difference between youths and adults is much greater than the variation \nwithin the different adult subgroups where the unionisation rates are fairly similar.   As youths \nmature, the density rates of the older age cohort are similar to the density rates of the early adult \n 3 \nage group in the preceding cohort.  In 2000, the 25-44 age group had a union density rate very \nclose to the rate for 25-44 year olds in 1990, and that figure is still almost double the youth rate \nin 1990 or 2000.  The stability of the youth-adult density differential (last row of Table 1) \nimplies that there is no disproportionate trend towards lower union membership amongst youth.  \nIt is this persistence of the large adult-youth density differential that requires explaining. \n[Place Table 1 about here] \nA number of reasons have been offered in the literature for the lower union density rates \nof youths as compared to adults.  In a Canadian context, membership and coverage tend to come \nwith the job (Gallager 1999: 239; Payne 1989: 113).  One obvious factor, therefore, contributing \nto low union density amongst the young is that youths occupy jobs that have low union coverage \nrates such as retail and private services (Meltz 1993: 209).  As young cohorts age they enter \nindustries and occupations with higher density rates and they also move from temporary jobs to \nmore long-term jobs across a wider spectrum of industries, which again increases the likelihood \nof unionisation.    \nIt is also reasonable to expect that youths would have a lower preference for unionisation \nthan adults, since turnover rates are much higher among the young (Lowe 1998: 246) implying \nthat young workers  have a lower commitment to a job and are more inclined to exercise the exit \noption than the voice option when disapproving of working conditions.  This higher turnover of \nyouths implies that the perceptions of the costs and benefits of unionisation for youth would be \nexpected to differ from that of adults, especially if the benefits for youth tend to come in the \ndistant future (Bain and Elias 1995:81).  It is to the determinants of those preferences that we \nnow turn.   \n \n 4 \n3. Determinants of preferences for unionisation by youths and adults \nThe different preferences that youths and adults have towards unionisation can be \nmodelled from an economic framework that is complemented and enriched by a social \npsychological perspective.  We begin with an economic analysis of preferences for unionisation \nbased on an expected utility approach advanced by Farber (2001:16) and Riddell (1993:117).  \nOnce we demonstrate how attitudes towards unionisation enter the standard expected utility \nframework, Montgomery\u2019s (1999) social psychological model of self-concept formation will \nhelp us understand how these same preferences are shaped by family and the socialisation \nprocess prior to, and during, the initial stages of a working career (e.g., Barling et. al. 1991; \nKelloway et. al. 1996) \n  Attitudes and preferences are important since they generally lead to the formation of a \nbehavioral intention on the part of an individual, which, when afforded a sufficient degree of \ncontrol over behavior, will induce that individual to carry out their intentions when the \nopportunity arises (Ajzen 1991).  Given that attitudes are important determinants of intentions, \nand that intentions are the immediate antecedents of behavior (Sutton 1998) it is not surprising to \nfind that positive attitudes towards unions tend to lead to pro-union actions, such as voting for \nunions in representation elections (Fiorito 1987:282; Montgomery 1989).  Attitudes towards \nunions, therefore, are an important ingredient in sustaining or replenishing membership.   \n3.1 An economic model of union preferences  \nFollowing Farber (1983: 1421) and Riddell (1993: 119), the conventional assumption among \nlabour economists is that workers have stable preferences for unionisation, and that individuals \nwill prefer unionisation if the expected utility of a union job exceeds that of a non-union job.  \nThis in turn depends upon the costs and benefits of unionisation as affected by such factors as the \n 5 \nexpected union wage premium and non-wage aspects of employment such as relationships with \nsupervisors and chances for promotion or layoff.  The utility associated with unionisation will \nalso be affected by unmeasured attitudes reflecting tastes or preferences towards union \nmembership.   \nIt is this latter inclination of an individual -- to be either \u2018pro-union\u2019 or \u2018anti-union\u2019 \nindependent of the benefits and costs of unionisation -- that is of particular relevance in the \ncontext of youth-adult differences in preferences for unionisation.  Traditionally, economists \ntreat independent tastes for unionisation as fixed, but such preference formation can be better \nunderstood by extending the economic framework through social-psychological models of \npreference formation. \n3.2 A social psychological model of union preference formation \nRather than utilizing a utility function, as do economists, social psychologists talk about the self \nand the process by which self-concepts are formed (Aronson 1988).  We utilise that perspective \nby arguing that young workers start off essentially as \u2018black boxes\u2019 with no well-defined self-\nconcept concerning unionisation.  Their preferences concerning union membership are therefore \nmalleable (Lowe and Rastin 2000:203) and are substantially influenced by social background \n(e.g., whether a family member is a member of a union or not) and the attitudes of peers (e.g., \nwhether family and friends are generally supportive of unions).  The importance of family and \nthe socialisation process prior to, and during, the initial stages of a working career is emphasised, \nfor example, in Barling et. al. (1991) and Kelloway et. al. (1996).  The socialisation process is \nfurther influenced by the nature of early workplace experiences (e.g., whether a worker is \nemployed in a unionised or a non-unionised environment).  The importance of initial exposures \nto unions and preferences for unionisation throughout the life course is emphasised in Freeman \n 6 \nand Diamond (2001), and for youths in particular by Fullagar and Barling (1989), Fullagar et. al. \n(1995), and Payne (1989).   Following Coleman (1988), this vector of various social factors \nwhich influence demand for unionisation can be grouped under the heading social capital. \n Building upon this foundation of social capital, the socialisation process for any given \nworker can be summarised using Montgomery\u2019s (1999: 6) attribution model of self-concept \nformation. The dynamics of the self-attribution model depend on the assumptions one makes \nabout the self-concept and how well defined it is before a worker enters the labour market. A \nyoung worker with little or no employment experience has a different dynamic than an adult \nworker with many years of labour market experience. Youth preferences are established early \nand solidify with age and experience (Lowe and Rastin, 2000:216). The ordering of the feedback \nmodel reflects this process, with a young worker first influenced by social capital (e.g., familial \nunion status and prevailing social and workplace norms) which leads to certain individual actions \n(e.g., applying for union jobs or participation in organising drives). These actions are then \ninternalised through attributions such as beliefs about the importance of loyalty to an employer \nor ideals concerning individual or collective solutions to workplace problems. Youth idealism in \nthe unionisation process is emphasised, for example, in Cregan and Johnston (1990). Finally, it is \nthrough these attributions that a pro-or anti-union self-concept is formed, which in turn feeds \nback into the initial social capital of the community, continuing to fuel the dynamic \nintergenerational process of preference formation outlined above. Summarizing the schematic \nlaid out in Montgomery (1999: 6), the dynamic process moves from (1) social capital to (2) \nindividual actions to (3) internalisation through attribution formation to (4) self-concept \nformation which in turn feeds back into social capital formation in following periods. \n 7 \n The modelling framework above implies that as workers mature and gain labour market \nexperience, the proclivity to be for or against unionisation becomes more inelastic (i.e., less \nresponsive to alteration from social forces and prevailing workplace norms).  As workers age, \npreferences become more fixed as opposed to being responsive to other variables.  This has \nimportant implications for unions and their organisers, as it indicates that although youths make \nup only 1\/5 of all union members, they are attitudinally amenable to union membership, whereas \nadults appear to be less sensitive to altering their preferences for union representation based on \nfactors found inside and outside of the workplace.   \n \n4.  Econometric analysis procedures  \nOur dependent variable is a measure of preferences for unionisation based on the response to the \nsurvey question \u201cAll things considered, if you had a choice, would you personally prefer to \nbelong to\/ remain in a labour union or not?\u201d (hereafter simply referred to as preferring a union).  \nLogistic regression equations are estimated separately for youths and adults, based on the \ndichotomous dependent variable coded 1 if respondents would prefer to belong to a union, and 0 \nif not.  The 12.8 % of respondents who indicated \u201cdid not know\u201d to the question on their \npreference for a union were omitted from the analysis since they could not logically be grouped \nas being closer to either the yes or the no category, and a separate analysis of the \u201cdid not know\u201d \ncategory did not seem merited.  The results are very similar if they are grouped with the \nrespondents who indicated \u201cno\u201d. \nOur independent variables are drawn from survey responses that reflect the perceived \ncosts and benefits of unionisation for youth and adult workers.  The independent variables are \ngrouped into five general categories: (i) social capital indicators (whether union member in the \n 8 \nfamily, and whether family and friends support unions); (ii) attitudes towards traditional union \npolicies (positive attitude towards pay standardisation; positive view of worker political power; \npreference for layoffs based on seniority; perception that collective solutions to work problems \nare best); (iii) perceptions about the employer and the job (feel no loyalty to employer; feels \nemployees are  treated unfairly at work; perceives poor opportunity for advancement at work; \nworried about layoffs); (iv) union-voice substitutes (no progressive HRM practices at job; feels \nunprotected by workplace law); and, (v) individual characteristics (gender; union status; political \nposition).  How each variable is measured is detailed in Table 2.  Our explanatory variables are \ncoded such that a positive coefficient is expected.  \n[Place Table 2 about here] \nAs outlined in Nielson (1998:116), for binary coded dependent variables as in logistic \nregressions, the difference in probabilities of preferring membership can be decomposed into one \npart which is caused by differing propensities (R) and another part which is explained by \ndifferences in characteristics (C) between youths (y) and adults (a). Using adults as the standard, \nthe average estimated probability of desired unionisation for both age groups is given by \n(1)                                                \nyi\nN\ni\nByiXFyP\ny\nN\n\/\n1\n\u02c6\u2211 \u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1\n=\n=  \n(2)     [ ]\nai\nN\ni ai\nXFaP\na\nN\n\/\n1\n\u02c6\u2211\n=\n= \u03b4  \nwhere N i is the number of observations for each age group j. Define \n \n(3)                                              [ ]\nai\nN\ni\nBaiXF\ny\naP\na\nN\n\/\n1\n\u02c6\u2211\n=\n=  \n 9 \nwhere (1) is the preferred rate of union membership amongst adults that would be predicted if \neach adult worker retained his or her \u2018union-preferring\u2019 individual and workplace characteristics, \nbut the impacts of those characteristics on the probability of preferring to belong to a union were \nthe same as those estimated for youths. The intergenerational union preference gap can then be \ndecomposed using the following identity, which defines R and C:  \n(4)                      4342143421\nC\nyP\ny\naP\nR\ny\naPaPyPaP \u2212+\u2212=\u2212  \nThe term R is the average probability that D=1 for adults minus the average probability that D=1 \nif adults reacted like youth. The term C is the average probability that D=1 for adults if they \nreacted like youth minus the average probability that D=1 for youths. \nFrom an empirical perspective, the modelling framework outlined in Section 3 implies \nthat the response parameters (i.e., coefficients) to social capital and various other determinants of \nunionisation will be larger for youths than for comparable adults.  As well, the cumulative effect \nof this greater responsiveness on the part of youths should explain a larger portion of the overall \ndifference in the preferences on the part of youths compared to adults for unionisation.  That is, \nin the decomposition analysis, the component due to response differences (coefficients) between \nyouths and adults should be greater than the component due to differences between youths and \nadults in their characteristics (independent variables). \n \n5. The data and limitations \nOur empirical analysis of the preferences for unionisation utilises data from the Lipset and Meltz \n(1997) Canada-U.S. Labour Attitudes Survey for Canada.  The survey utilized quota sampling \n(Kervin 1992: 220) to generate a representative sample of workers by determining how many \n 10 \nresponses were needed to obtain representativeness over observable characteristics based on \nCensus data (e.g., region, gender, age and employment status) and then contacting households \nuntil those sample targets are met .  Quota sampling does not have a sampling frame and hence \nthere is no conventional \u201cresponse rate\u201d since there is no randomly drawn target sample from \nwhich a proportion of valid responses can be drawn.  Of those contacted, however, 58.7% \nresponded.  Given that quota sampling is designed specifically to ensure a representative sample \nacross various observable characteristics (based on Census data in this case), it is not surprising \nthat the survey characteristics match very closely the population characteristics as given by the \nCensus (Table 3). \n[Place Table 3 about here] \nThe purpose of the survey was to determine attitudes toward work, institutions and social \npolicy.  Information was obtained on general values of workers, including views on \nindividualism versus group or communitarian orientation, the appropriate role of governments, \nconfidence in institutions, and perceptions of labour market outcomes such as their expectations \nabout layoffs.   \nThe Angus Reid Group, one of Canada\u2019s leading public opinion survey firms, \nadministered the survey through telephone calls - which averaged 20-26 minutes per respondent \n- in June and early July 1996.  The survey yielded a representative sample of 1495 working-age \npeople in Canada.  Cases were eliminated in our analysis if they were missing observations on \nthe dependent variable, reducing our sample to 1,204 (1,057 adults and 147 youths). \nThe small youth sample makes it is more difficult to obtain precise estimates of the \nunderlying relationship for youths compared to the larger sample of adults.  We sustained the \nyouth sample size in part by including 40 non-employed respondents with the 107 who were \n 11 \nemployed at the time of the survey. The non-employed were asked all questions except on \nperceptions of work conditions and jobs, and on union voice substitutes, that is, those in groups \n(iii) and (iv) above.  Their responses were coded as \u201cunknown\u201d for these questions.  For all other \nquestions they are treated as regular respondents, responding with their views of the situation.  \nThe preferences of the non-employed are important since many are looking for work and others \nare about to obtain work.  We can assume that they respond to questions based on their past or \nexpected status or on their general view of those situations.  Their responses are meaningful \nsince our goal is to capture general preferences for unionisation, not whether one would vote for \na union at his or her particular job.   \n  Including the non-employed in the analysis is further buttressed by the fact that we also \nran the model with an added non-employed dummy variable (compared to employed).  The logit \ncoefficient of 0.053 was statistically insignificant (p = 0.97), yielding a marginal effect of 0.01.  \nThat is, there was virtually no difference in the preferences for unionisation between the \nemployed versus non-employed.  Furthermore, the other coefficients (unreported but available \nfrom the authors on request) remained virtually unchanged.  In spite of this similarity between \nthe preferences of the employed and non-employed, we regard the small sample for youths as a \nlimitation of our analysis.  We would have preferred to have a larger sample for youths both to \nobtain more precise estimates and to be able to restrict the analysis only to the employed.  \n A second limitation of our analysis \u2013 common method variance \u2013 may arise if \nrespondents with certain characteristics may self-report in a way that systematically affects both \nindependent and dependent variables, giving rise to spurious correlation.  As emphasised by \nHartley and Barling (1998:167) once the survey data has been collected there is little that can be \ndone other than recognising the possible limitation and interpreting the results with caution.  \n \n 12 \n6.  Results  \nA Chow-type test (Greene 2000: 826) on the similarity of the coefficients in the youth and adult \nequations yielded a Likelihood Ratio of 394.72 which is well above the critical value of 135.81 \nat the 0.01 level of significance from the chi-squared distribution.  This indicates that the \nunderlying structure (i.e., coefficients) of the two equations were significantly different from \neach other so that separate equations are appropriate. \n6.1 Decomposition analysis and overall picture \n \nAs indicated in Table 4, 56.7 percent of youths in our sample (row 1) compared to 49.8 percent \nof adults (row 2) expressed a preference to belong to a union, for an overall difference of 6.9 in \nfavour of youths preferring unions (row 6).  As indicated in row 4, about two-thirds (62 percent) \nof the higher preference of youths for unionisation can be attributed to the greater response of \nyouths to prefer unionisation, and about one third (38 percent as indicated in row 5) can be \nattributed to the fact that youths are more exposed to the social capital, workplace issues or \nattitudes that give rise to a greater preference for unionisation to deal with such issues in general.  \nThis finding also confirms our hypothesis that older respondents have a more hardened attitude \ntowards unions that cannot be so readily dislodged by external influences. \n[Place Table 4 about here] \nTable 5 indicates the separate impact of each of the various independent variables \ninfluencing the probability of preferring unionisation amongst youths and adults in Canada.  As \nis conventional, marginal effects or changes in probabilities are reported, calculated from the \nlogit coefficients that are also given in Table 5. \n[Place Table 5 about here] \nIn general, the results confirm our hypothesis that youth are more responsive than adults \nto the determinants of preferences for unionisation.  That is, the changes in probabilities are \n 13 \ngenerally larger and more often statistically significant for youths (column 3) compared to adults \n(column 7).  In part as a result of this, youths have a stronger overall desire for unionisation than \ndo adults as discussed previously in the decomposition analysis and as indicated in the first row \nof the table whereby 56.7 percent of youths and 49.8 percent of adults in our sample indicate that \nthey would prefer a union.  The subsequent rows show the effects of various characteristics on \nthe preferences for union membership.  Both the sample means of the explanatory variables and \nthe effect they have on the probability of preferring unionisation (i.e., the logit coefficients \ntranslated into changes in probability) are discussed and compared since each provide interesting \ninformation on youth-adult differences in unionisation.   \n6.1 The effects of social capital and social norms \nPersons who have a union member in the family are themselves much more likely to prefer \nunionisation, with the effect being more than three times as strong for youths compared to adults.  \nSpecifically, the probability of preferring unions is 0.37 higher for youths from families with an \nexisting union member, while it is 0.11 higher for adults in the same circumstances.  As \nanticipated from the social psychological model of union preference formation, families are a \nmore important influence in shaping the preferences of youths than is the case for adults. \n A similar pattern prevails for the influence of family and friends and their support for \nunionisation.  That is, the influence of family and friends is important for both youths and adults, \nbut once again stronger for youths than for adults.  Specifically, the probability of preferring \nunions is 0.41 higher for youths whose family and friends support unions, compared to 0.29 \nhigher for adults in the same circumstances.  The influence of family and friends is therefore \nmuch stronger in determining the preferences for youths than for adults. \n 14 \n6.2 The effects of traditional union policies \nThe probability of preferring a union is higher amongst persons who prefer pay standardisation \nas opposed to merit-based pay.  This is understandable given that unions also generally prefer \nsuch pay standardisation.  The effect is almost twice as large for youth (0.30) compared to adults \n(0.18) highlighting our proposition that youths are more responsive than are adults to the factors \nthat influence preferences for unionisation in general.  The sample means also indicate that \napproximately 20 percent of youths tend to have a positive attitude to pay standaridisation, with a \nslightly higher figure for adults. \n Not surprisingly, the probability of preferring unionisation is considerably higher for \npersons who also feel that workers should have more political power.  The impact is especially \nlarge for youth (0.34) compared to adults (0.23).  The mean values also indicate that \nproportionately more youths (77 percent) compared to adults (61percent) in our sample think that \nworkers should have more political power.  In essence, youths have a more positive view of \nworkers having political power compared to adults and youths are more prepared to act on it by \nsupporting unionisation. \nThe proportion of respondents who follow the traditional union policy of preferring \nlayoffs based solely on seniority was lower for youths (0.36) than for adults (0.42).   These \ndifferences are not as large as one may have expected given that layoffs based on seniority as \nopposed to merit would disproportionately benefit adults.  Those youths who do believe that \nlayoffs should be based only on seniority, however, do not seem prepared to translate their \nbeliefs into reality by supporting unions (i.e., their coefficients on preferring unions are \ninsignificant for youths).  Adults who believe that layoffs should be based on seniority, however, \nare much more likely to act on their beliefs by supporting unions since unions would help \n 15 \ntranslate those beliefs into reality by supporting the seniority principle (i.e., the coefficient on \npreferring unions is positive, large and significant for adults who support the seniority principle). \n The proportion of youths and adults in our sample who believe that individual solutions \nto workplace problems are better than collective solutions is fairly similar for youths and adults.  \nThe fact that almost half of each group responded they \u201cdid not know\u201d to this question (see note \nat bottom of Table 3) suggests that substantial numbers could be persuaded to support either \ncollective or individual policies (e.g., unions or progressive HRM practices).    \nEven though similar proportions of youths and adults in our sample feel that collective \nsolutions to workplace problems are better than individual solutions, adults seem more willing to \nact on their views through supporting unions (i.e., the adult coefficient is positive and significant, \nP = 0.02, while the youth coefficient is insignificant, P = 0.61).  This is one of the few areas \nwhere adults seem more willing than youths (i.e., where the magnitude of the coefficient was \ngreater for adults than for youths) to express a greater preference for unionisation when they had \na belief that was conducive to unionisation. \n6.3  The effect of working conditions and job characteristics \nAdults who feel no loyalty to their employer or who do not know if they feel loyalty to their \nemployer are 0.16 more likely to prefer a union, compared to adults who feel loyalty to their \nemployer (although this effect is significant only at the 0.12 level).   For youths, the effect is \nstatistically insignificant (P = 0.73). \nThe effect of the perception of employees being treated unfairly is more dramatic for \nyouths.  Specifically, the probability of preferring unions is 0.42 greater for youths who perceive \nemployees are being treated unfairly, compared to youths who do not perceive employees as \nbeing treated unfairly.  For adults, the impact of unfair treatment is small (0.07) and statistically \n 16 \ninsignificant.  Importantly, the sample means indicate that 58 percent of youths compared to only \n13 percent of adults perceive employees as being treated unfairly at their workplace.  In essence, \nyouths have a much stronger perception of unfair treatment at the workplace and are more \nprepared to support unionisation as a result.  The substantial numbers of both youths and adults \nwho reported that they \u201cdid not know\u201d whether employees are treated unfairly at work (see note \nat bottom of Table 3) suggests that substantial numbers could be influenced by unions or by \nprogressive HRM practices that would facilitate fair treatment at work. \n The mean values indicate that the same proportion of youths and adults (around 31 \npercent) tend to think they have poor opportunity for advancement.  Interestingly, this has an \nopposite effect on youths compared to adults.  Adults who feel they have a poor opportunity for \nadvancement are more likely to prefer unions, while for youths the opposite is the case (although \nstatistically insignificant).  This is not surprising given that the seniority principle followed by \nunions is apt to favour adult opportunities for advancement at the expense of young workers.   \n Only about 19 percent of youths, compared to 31.5 percent of adults in our sample, worry \nabout layoffs, perhaps reflecting the lower cost of layoffs to youths and the fact that they expect \nto be laid off given the practice of \u201clast-in, first-out\u201d.  The different impact that this concern for \nlayoffs has on preferences for unionisation between youths and adults, however, is large \u2013 \nincreasing the probability of preferring a union by 42 percent for youths with zero impact for \nadults.  This is somewhat surprising since unions would tend to foster the last-in, first-out \nphenomenon that tends to put youths at more risk of layoffs, compared to adults.    \n6.4 The effect of union voice substitutes  \nA lack of progressive HRM practices at work (e.g., self-directed work teams, total quality \nmanagement, quality circles, employee involvement programs, as defined earlier in Table 2) \n 17 \nleads to a large preference for unions on the part of youths, but no effect on the preferences of \nadults.  This highlights the possibility that progressive HRM practices can be a substitute for \nunionisation (a concern long recognized in the literature) especially in the minds of younger \nworkers in the years when their preferences for their \u2018ideal\u2019 working environment are being \nshaped.  It also highlights the understandable resistance that unions often have to such practices \nsince they are a viable threat to unions, especially for the new generation of workers that have \nnot been raised under a history of unionism.  \n Similar portions of adults and youths in our sample felt that they were protected by \nworkplace law (51 percent).  The fact that slightly over 30 percent (see note at bottom of Table \n3) of both youths and adults did not know if they felt protected again highlights the substantial \nnumbers who could be influenced by such protection (to the extent that it is a substitute for the \nprotection provided by unions).  This is especially the case for youths since those who felt that \nthey were not protected by workplace law were 0.35 more likely to prefer a union than were \nyouths who felt they were protected by such laws.   \n6.5  The effect of individual characteristics \nThe preference for unionisation is lower for male compared to female youths, and the opposite \nfor male compared to female adults.  This is one of the few variables that has a sign difference \nbetween youths and adults.  The sign reversal is consistent with unions catering to male \npreferences for older persons, but shifting towards female preferences, as women become more \nprominent in the workforce and in unions.  The effects, however, are statistically insignificant, \nmarginally so in the case of youths (p = 0.11) and more so in the case of adults (p = 0.19). \n The preference for unionisation is vastly higher for both youths and adults who are \ncurrently union members compared to those who are not union members.  Youths who are union \n 18 \nmembers are 0.36 more likely to prefer unionisation than are youths who are not union members, \nand the effect is slightly larger for adults.  The fact that union members (for both youths and \nadults) prefer unionisation suggests that the number who want to remain certified vastly \noutweighs the number of union members who would prefer decertification.   \n As indicated by the sample mean values, the political orientation of youths and adults in \nterms of left, right and centre on the political spectrum are remarkably similar.  This is somewhat \nsurprising given the perception that people become more conservative as they age, but it is \nconsistent with the perspective that youths today are more conservative than youths of yesterday.   \nAs expected, persons at the centre and especially on the left in the political spectrum are more \nlikely to prefer unions than are persons on the right of the spectrum, although the effects are not \nstatistically significant for youths (P = 0.22). \n \n7.  Conclusions  \nOur analysis of the preferences for unionisation on the part of youths and adults gives rise \nto the following generalisations: \n\u0083 Youths have a stronger preference than do adults for unions in general and most of that \nreflects the stronger desire of youths to have unions deal with workplace issues, than it \nreflects the exposure of youths to these issues.  Conversely, as workers age they appear to \nhave a weaker preference for unions to deal with workplace issues. \n\u0083 The preferences of young workers for unionisation are malleable and strongly shaped by \ntheir accumulated social capital, such as union membership in the family and the attitudes of \nfamily and friends towards unions, highlighting the cumulative and inter-generational effects \nthat can be involved in the transmission of union status. \n 19 \n\u2022 Substitutes for unionisation such as progressive HRM practices and legislative protection \nalso have a powerful effect on young workers\u2019 preferences for unionisation. The fact that \nyouths who felt unprotected by labour law had a strong preference for unions highlights the \nconventional dilemma that unions face in this area.  They may support protective legislation \nfor reasons of social justice and because it can raise the cost of non-union labour relative to \nunion labour that already has that protection through the collective agreement.  But such \nlegislation can also be a substitute for unionisation to the extent that it reduces the need to \nprovide the protection through unionisation. \n\u0083 Large number of respondents indicated that they \u201cdid not know\u201d whether collective or \nindividual solutions were better, or whether employees were treated unfairly at work, or \nwhether they felt unprotected by workplace law. This highlights the substantial number of \nyouths who could be persuaded into individual or collective solutions (e.g., progressive HRM \npractices or unions) to deal with such workplace issues. \nOur analysis implies that there is a large potential among youths in our sample to either \nsupport or oppose unionisation, depending on the views of family and friends about unions and \ndepending on conditions inside the workplace.  In essence, unions have an opportunity to \nincrease the rate of unionisation among youth if youths become more acquainted with unions and \nif they are in workplaces where they believe that employees are not being fairly treated. \nInvestment by unions in education and organizing can have a long-term payoff for the labour \nmovement. By tilting the taste for unionisation more strongly in the positive direction, any union \norganizing and educational programme targeted to today\u2019s youth can have a multiplier effect on \nsuccessive generations because as workers age, independent predictors of union preferences \nbecome less important and less effective in shifting tastes for unionisation. \n 20 \nThe large impacts of the \u201cunion member in the family\u201d and the \u201cfamily and friends \nsupport unions\u201d variables, offers one explanation for the cumulative, snowballing effect that \noccurs when initial union decline seems to foster subsequent union decline, as in the U.S. over \nthe last three decades.  If union membership begins to fall, then it is less likely that there will be \na union member in the family, and less likely that family and friends will support unions \n(especially given the earlier positive effect of union status on preferences for unionisation).  In \nsuch circumstances, union decline begets further union decline, given the much stronger effect \nthat these variables have on youths as compared to adults.  The implications of this finding for \nunion organizing are striking, since the intergenerational transmission of non-union forms of \nsocial capital will persist as young cohorts mature and continue working throughout their \nlifecycle.  Of course, the same process works in the opposite direction.  Effective union \norganising today can have multiplier effects well into the future, as it leads to more union family \nmembers and more union friendly family and peers, both of which enhance preferences for \nunionisation, especially amongst youths upon which future unionisation is built. \nA number of surprises in our empirical study also add to possibilities for organising \nyouth.  Relative to adults, youth have a more supportive view of worker political power and they \nare only slightly more supportive of merit as a basis for layoffs.  Youths are more positive about \nunions than are adults and this is a potential that unions can build upon.  The fact that almost half \nof the youth had no views on individual versus collective solutions to problems in the workplace \nadds further credence to the perspective that the views of youth are malleable.  This can perhaps \naccount for the large discrepancy between greater stated desire for union membership and lower \nrealised demand for unionisation (union density at the time of the survey was only 13.0 percent \nfor youths compared to 36.0 percent for adults, even though youth had a stronger preference for \n 21 \nunions than did adults).   It also means that the manner in which unions and management \nultimately respond to the views and needs of young persons will have a strong influence on the \nfuture of unions and of workplace practices.   \n \nAcknowledgements \nFinancial assistance from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council and the  \nGovernment of Canada project on Regional Aspects of Employment Relations Policy in Canada \nand the Leverhulme Future of Trade Unions in Britain fund is gratefully acknowledged.
