INTRODUCTION \nDielectric spectroscopy is an established experimental technique for probing molecular \nprocesses in polymers [1]. The use of the technique in studies of cure in thermosetting resins \nsuch as epoxies is also well established [2 \u2013 7]. During the cure the thermosetting resin \nundergoes a transformation from a liquid to a rubber, as a result of the formation of a three \ndimensional molecular network, and then to a glass upon further advancement of the cross-\nlinking reaction. In dielectric spectroscopy the electrical properties of the curing thermoset are \nmeasured over a wide frequency range as functions of time and of temperature. The spectra \nobtained give an insight into the material state at specific cure times, due to the strong \ndependence of the dielectric permittivity and dielectric loss, on the changing chemical and \nstructural state of the material [1, 8]. Mijovic and co-workers have developed a slightly \ndifferent but equivalent approach, based on the utilisation of the complex impedance \nspectrum [9 \u2013 15]. The applicability of the technique to industrial process control is \nconditional on the existence of an efficient methodology for quantitative translation of the \nimpedance spectra to material state.  \nIn this paper, fitting of cure monitoring spectra is performed using genetic algorithms. Several \nobjective functions are tested; namely weighted least squares, weighted absolute differences, \n                                                 \n1 Current address: Centre for Micromechanics, Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, \nTrumpington street, Cambridge, CB2 1PZ, United Kingdom \nleast squares with logarithmic scaling of the experimental data and absolute differences with \nlogarithmic scaling. \nThe effect of regularization on parameters estimation is also investigated. Simulated data with \nGaussian noise and outliers are used for the assessment of the most appropriate objective \nfunction. Real experimental data are analyzed using the chosen objective function with and \nwithout the regularization term. \n \n \n2. BASIC DIELECTRIC THEORY AND EQUIVALENT CIRCUIT MODELS \nThree phenomena are present in the electrical response of a curing thermosetting resin at \nrelatively low frequencies (1 Hz \u2013 1 MHz): electrode polarisation, charge migration and \ndipolar relaxation [2, 10]. Consideration of these fundamental phenomena, backed up by \nexperimental evidence, has led to the development of an equivalent circuit representation of \nthe processes that affect the signal during the cure [9, 10]. The dipolar movements are \nmodelled by a capacitor (Cdip) connected in series with a resistor (Rdip) and in parallel with \nanother capacitor (Cind). The first two elements represent the permanent dipoles, which are \npresent in resins due to the charge distribution in asymmetric molecules or molecular groups \n[1], whilst the Cind element represents the dipoles that are induced by the application of the \nelectric field. A resistor (Rion) models the presence of extrinsic and intrinsic charge carriers [2, \n14, 15]. The resulting circuit is shown in Figure 1. \n \n \nFigure 1: Equivalent circuit of epoxy thermoset \n \nElectrode polarisation, which originates from the accumulation of charges close to the surface \nof the embedded electrodes, is typically modelled using capacitors in series with the rest of \nthe circuit [9, 10]. However, it has been reported that Constant Phase Elements model the \nnon-ideal capacitive behaviour of the electrode-material interface more successfully [16]. The \ncomplex impedance ZCPE of such an element is: \n  (1) \nwhere \u03c9 is the angular frequency ( 2= fw p ) and Rel, n are the CPE parameters.  \nThe complex impedance Z of the overall equivalent circuit, which is shown in Figure 1, is:  \n  (1) \nwhere the real (Z\u0384) and imaginary (Z\u0384\u0384) components are: \n  (2) \n (3) \nRelationships between the maximum of imaginary impedance and thermoset resistivity during \ncure have been established [10, 13]. The vitrification of the curing system has also been \nidentified successfully using the impedance spectra [14]. However, fitting of the experimental \ndata throughout the experimentally accessible frequency spectrum and determination of the \nevolution of circuit elements during the cure has not been attempted.  \nEquivalent circuit analysis is a general tool for data interpretation of complex systems [17]. \nImpedance spectra are usually fitted using weighted linear squares methods introduced by \nMacdonald [17 \u2013 22]. The weight factors are a measure of the variance of each experimental \npoint. As impedance is a complex variable, the real and imaginary components are fitted \nconcurrently, taken as independent variables. Theoretically this is not true as the Kramers \u2013 \nKronig transformation relates the real and imaginary part of such a variable [23, 24]. In \npractice, however, one needs to cover a very wide frequency spectrum for the transformation \nto give valid results [17].  \nThe resulting objective function for the weighted linear squares has the following form: \n  (4) \nwhere S denotes the objective function, q is the number of measured frequencies and wk are \nthe weight factors for the real and imaginary parts of the complex impedance. The subscripts \nexp and mod, respectively, denote the experimental impedance value and that obtained from \nthe application of equations 3 and 4. \nInstead of the sum of squares, it is possible to use the sum of absolute differences as the \nobjective function: \n  (5) \nThe use of absolute differences is more robust than using the least squares method, in terms of \ntolerance to experimental outliers [25]. In cure monitoring the impedance values change \nseveral orders of magnitude (typically 103 \u2013 109 Ohm) during the experiment and towards the \nend of cure they reach the limit of the apparatus measuring range. For the apparatus used in \nthis study \u2013 and for most of the commercially available instruments \u2013 this means that \nmeasurement scatter can be as high as 10%. Furthermore, interference with other electrical \nequipment is possible, resulting in spurious outliers. Dygas and Breiter have proposed a \nmethod for detecting and eliminating outliers in impedance spectra by comparing each \nexperimental point with its estimated standard deviation [26]. However, this method is not \nsuitable for analyzing consecutive spectra, as it demands replicate scans for the calculation of \nstandard deviation. In a cure monitoring experiment, the impedance spectrum changes as the \ncure progresses and it is not possible to repeat the measurement as the state of the material \nchanges irreversibly.  \nOne way to enhance the robustness of the objective function is to add a regularization term \n[27]. For the case of absolute differences, we have: \n  (6) \nwhere \u03bb is the Tikhonov regularization parameter [27], Pno is the number of fitting parameters \n(the number of circuit elements in Figure 1), park are the parameter values and park,exp is an \nestimation of the expected parameter values. A similar expression can be obtained for the \nleast squares case. \nThe presence of the regularization term suppresses any irregular fluctuations imposed by large \nerrors or outliers on the estimated parameters [27]. Winterhalter and co-workers have used an \nobjective function with a Tikhonov regularization term to model admittance spectra [28, 29]. \nThey fitted a continuous distribution of relaxation functions to experimental data and argued \nthat without the regularization term the number of significant relaxation peaks had to be \nchosen arbitrarily before any fitting was performed. \nThe fitting is performed by minimizing the objective function. Macdonald has developed a \nsoftware code [30] for solving the minimisation problem in the case of impedance spectra, \nbased on the Levenberg \u2013 Marquardt method [31]. The success of the minimisation depends \nstrongly on the initial estimates of the sought parameters. Furthermore, there is always a \npossibility of the algorithm converging to a local instead of the global minimum. \nIn contrast to hill-climbing methods, genetic algorithms provide global minimisation and \nfitting capabilities especially in the case of multivariate systems [32]. VanderNoot and \nAbrahams have utilised genetic algorithms to fit impedance spectra [33], using an objective \nfunction based on weighted absolute differences. Yang and co\u2013workers have also \nimplemented genetic algorithms to model admittance data [34], with a weighted least squares \nobjective function. \n \n \n3. ARTIFICIAL IMPEDANCE SPECTRA AND GENETIC ALGORITHM  \nConstruction of simulated spectra \nThe values of the circuit parameters used to generate artificial spectra are given in Table I. \nThey are representative of epoxy resin response in the early stages of cure, when the resin is \nliquid. The resulting spectra are shown in Figure 2.  \nIt can be observed that the real impedance values are nearly constant at low frequencies and \ndecrease rapidly at higher frequencies. (The slight drop observed in the very low frequency \nregion is a consequence of electrode polarisation.). The imaginary impedance spectrum \nexhibits a minimum and a maximum, with the peak value relating to the extent of the charge \nmigration in the system.   \n \nTable I: Circuit element values for the construction of simulated spectra \nRion \n(Ohm) \nRdip \n(Ohm) \nCdip \n(F) \nCind \n(F) \nRel \n(Ohm) \nn \n106  104  2\u00d710-12  10-11  106  0.5 \n \nThe sensitivity of the resulting real and imaginary impedance spectra to the circuit parameters \nwas investigated. Each of the circuit parameter value was altered by \u00b1 10% whilst all the other \nparameters were kept constant. The average percentage difference from the original spectrum \nwas used as a measure of sensitivity over the whole frequency region. The results are \nsummarized in Table II. \n \n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\n4\n4.5\n5\n5.5\n6\n6.5\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\nlog [f (Hz)]\nlo\ng \n[Z\n (\nO\nh\nm\n)]\nlog [Z' (Ohm)]\nlog [Z'' (Ohm)]\n \nFigure 2: Real and Imaginary impedance spectra typical of a particular given state in epoxy resin \ncure. The equivalent circuit used is shown in Figure 1 and the circuit element values are \ngiven in Table I. \n \nIt can be observed that the spectra are sensitive to changes in Rion and Cind, whilst the \ninfluence of Rdip and Cdip is less marked. It should be noted that the sensitivity of the \nimpedance to each circuit parameter depends on the frequency. Electrode polarisation \nparameters, for example, have greater impact on the signal at low frequencies. \n \nTable II: Sensitivity to circuit parameters expressed as the average percentage difference \nfrom the original case for a \u00b1 10% change in the parameter \n Rion (Ohm) \nRdip \n(Ohm) \nCdip \n(F) \nCind \n(F) \nRel \n(Ohm) \nn \n+ 10% 8.42 0.58 1.34 6.14 0.25 2.21 Z\u2019 \n- 10% 7.10 0.01 1.03 5.36 2.86 2.61 \n+ 10% 8.00 0.57 1.35 4.95 0.25 1.12 Z\u2019\u2019 - 10% 7.56 0.01 1.02 4.96 2.86 2.52 \n \nA noise signal with a Gaussian distribution was added to the simulated values in order to \nassess the robustness of the estimation algorithm. The error values were taken by sampling \nthe normal distribution with mean 1 and standard deviation 0.033. These values were then \nmultiplied with the simulated values. The final simulated spectra contained a 10% maximum \nerror. \n \nGenetic algorithm \nThe flow chart of the binary genetic algorithm used for the minimisation is illustrated in \nFigure 3. The main parameters of the algorithm are the number N of solution vectors per \ngeneration (individuals), the maximum number of generations Gmax, the exchange probability \npe and the mutation probability pm.  The solution vectors are sorted and a predefined number \n(Ne) of the fittest individuals is passed to the next generation (elitism). Then, the solution \nvectors are encoded in binary format (each parameter in the vector becomes a sequence of 100 \ngenes) and the crossover and mutation operations are applied.   \nThe crossover operation is performed by selecting two encoded individuals and exchanging \ntheir bits. The selection of the individuals is proportional to their fitness (fitter individuals are \nmore likely to be selected). The bits to be exchanged are selected with probability pe. If this \nprobability is met the bits of the two individuals are exchanged (0 \u2194 1). The crossover \noperation produces two new offspring per iteration. Therefore, the number of iterations for the \nformation of a new generation of solutions will be: \n  (7) \nIn the coding of the algorithm, iteration i produced the offspring i and i+1. For this reason the \nnumber of individuals N (and Ne) is an odd number. \n \n \n \nFigure 3: Genetic algorithm flowchart \n \nThe mutation operation is performed by selecting a bit of an individual with probability pm \nand changing that bit from zero to one or vice versa. The probability pm changes for each \nsuccessive generation according to the dispersion of the solution vectors (adaptive mutation): \n  (8) \nwhere c is a parameter that determines the range of values of pm (choice of high c leads to \nlower values of pm). For this application c = 6. If the resulting pm was below 0.001, which \nmeans that the fitness deviation is very low (candidate solution values are very close), the \nmutation probability was reset to 0.025 to ensure further exploration of the solution search \nspace. \nThe crossover operation explores the candidate solution vector space and builds new, fitter, \nsolutions. The mutation operation ensures that the whole solution space is explored.  \nThe fitness function F used can be expressed as follows: \n  (9) \nwhere Si is the selected objective function. A list of all the objective functions used in this \ninvestigation is given in Table III.  \n \nTable III: Objective functions tested without any regularization term \nS1 \nWeighted least \nsquares \n \nS2 \nWeighted \nabsolute \ndifferences  \nS3 \nLogarithmic \nscaling \u2013 least \nsquares \nS4 \nLogarithmic \nscaling \u2013 \nabsolute \ndifferences \n \n \nThe fitness function varies from zero (Si \u2192 \u221e) to 100 (Si \u2192 0). The algorithm terminates \nwhen an individual with fitness higher than a predefined value (Fcritical) is found or when Gmax \nis reached. \nTest runs of the genetic algorithm were performed using the spectra of Figure 2 . The search \nspace for each parameter is given in Table IV. Parameters with greater sensitivity were given \na smaller space to explore. \nWeighted least squares were used as the objective function in these test runs. The fitness \nvalue of the final solution was used for comparing the different scenarios. For a number of \ngenerations Gmax, the best obtained fitness was divided by a final fitness value which was \nattained after 200 generations. For each scenario the algorithm ran 10 times.

Values of Rion, \nCind, Rel and n exhibit errors below 3%, for all the objective functions tested, whilst Rdip and \nCdip exhibit significant errors. From the percentage errors it is apparent  that the weighted least \nsquares objective function (S1) results in the most accurate Rion, Cind, Rel and n values, \nhowever, the estimates of Rdip and Cdip are poor. \nThe rest of the objective functions give similar results. The accuracy of the Rion, Cind, Rel and n \nvalues estimations is close to the results obtained using S1. The estimations of Rdip and Cdip are \nmuch better than those obtained with S1, especially in the case of the absolute differences \nobjective functions (S2 and S4). The logarithmic scaling objective functions give similar \nestimations compared to the objective functions using weight factors. \n \nEffect of the regularization parameter on spectra containing outliers \nSpectra containing 10% Gaussian error and four outlier points were fitted using the S4 \nobjective function with a regularization term as follows: \n  (10) \nThe fitted spectrum is illustrated in Figure 4. \nThree outliers were placed in the frequency area close to 60 Hz. This frequency region is \nmore vulnerable to noise coming from external electric devices. The last outlier was placed at \n1 Hz. The expected values parexp are given in Table I. \nThe dependence of the estimated circuit parameters on the regularization parameter value \u03bb   \nis shown in Figure 5. The initial value (\u03bb=0) means that the fitting is performed without the \nregularization term. \n \n22.5\n3\n3.5\n4\n4.5\n5\n5.5\n6\n6.5\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\nlog [f (Hz)]\nlo\ng \n[Z\n (\nO\nh\nm\n)]\nlog [Z' (Ohm)]\nlog [Z'' (Ohm)]\n \nFigure 4: Impedance spectrum with 4 outliers (indicated by crosses at log[f(Hz)] = 0, 1.5, \n1.75 and 2) and 10% random Gaussian noise \n \nIt is observed that the charge carriers resistance Rion estimation does not depend on the \nregularization parameter. The estimated value has a 2% error compared to the true value. The \ndipolar resistance Rdip estimation shows some dependence on the regularization term. Without \nthe regularization term \u2013 or with \u03bb < 0.2 \u2013 there is a 20% error on the estimation. As the \nregularization parameter increases the estimation error is reduced. This improvement of the \nestimation becomes less significant for \u03bb > 1. Similar behaviour is observed in the estimation \nof Cdip. The initial estimation error of approximately 8% is reduced to less than 2% when \u03bb \u2265 \n1. The induced capacitance Cind estimation is very good \u2013less than 3% error- with or without \nthe regularization term. A further improvement, however, is observed for \u03bb close to unity. The \nelectrode polarization parameters have a more significant dependence on \u03bb. Rel has an error of \nabout 8% without regularization, which is reduced to less than 1% when \u03bb = 1 and stays low \nfor higher \u03bb values. The estimation error in the exponent n is over 15% without regularization, \nwhich is reduced to approximately 5% when \u03bb > 1. \n \nExperimental cure monitoring data and modelling \nExperimental results \nHaving established the principle of use of the genetic algorithm in modelling of artificial \nspectra, the approach was implemented and tested on a set of real cure monitoring data. The \nmaterial used for the acquisition of the experimental data set was RTM6, an aerospace grade \nepoxy resin supplied by Hexcel\u00ae Composites UK. The resin was cured isothermally at 150\u00b0C. \nA Solartron Analytical\u00ae 1260 Gain \u2013 Phase Analyzer was used to obtain the impedance data \nover the frequency range from 1Hz to 1MHz. A total of 25 frequencies were measured. The \nduration of each frequency sweep was ~2min. Temperature control to within 0.1\u00b0C was \nachieved through a 2408 Eurotherm\u00ae temperature controller. The dielectric sensor used has a \ntypical comb-electrode geometry and is commercially available from Pearson Panke Ltd (GIA \nsensor) \u2013 see Figure 6. \nRion\n960000\n970000\n980000\n990000\n1000000\n1010000\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0\n\u03bb\nR\nio\nn \n(O\nh\nm\n)\nRdip\n6000\n8000\n10000\n12000\n14000\n16000\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0\n\u03bb\nR\ndi\np \n(O\nh\nm\n)\n \nCind\n9.60E-12\n9.70E-12\n9.80E-12\n9.90E-12\n1.00E-11\n1.01E-11\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0\n\u03bb\nC\nin\nd \n(F\n)\nCdip\n1.80E-12\n1.92E-12\n2.04E-12\n2.16E-12\n2.28E-12\n2.40E-12\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0\n\u03bb\nC\ndi\np \n(F\n)\n \nRel\n984000\n1008000\n1032000\n1056000\n1080000\n1104000\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0\n\u03bb\nR\nel\n (\nO\nh\nm\n)\nn\n0.480\n0.504\n0.528\n0.552\n0.576\n0.600\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0\n\u03bb\nn\n \nFigure 5: Dependence of circuit parameters on the regularization parameter.

This means that the \nimpedance values are relatively low. As the polymerisation reaction proceeds, the average \nmolecular weight of the polymer chains increases and a three \u2013 dimensional network starts to \nform. This network formation impedes the movements of charge carriers and results in higher \nimpedance values. Towards the end of the cure, the resin vitrifies. Charge carriers movements \nare strongly hindered in the final glassy state of the polymer. Impedance spectra settle at very \nhigh final values and any further increase with time is negligible. Electrode polarisation is \ndominant at low frequencies in the imaginary impedance spectrum. As the cure progresses, \nthis region moves out of the experimental frequency range. \n \nApplication of genetic algorithm \nThe first two spectra, corresponding to 2 min and 4 min (not shown in Figures 7 and 8) \nrespectively, were fitted without the regularization term. The fitted parameters were then used \nfor the calculation of the parexp estimates, for the fitting of the next spectrum. Linear \nextrapolation was used as follows: \n (11) \nwhere the exponents ti, i = 1,2,3 denote the average time where the impedance spectrum data \nwere recorded. For every frequency sweep, ti is given by: \n  (12) \nThe effect of the regularization term is that it penalises irrational jumps in the circuit \nparameter values. The physical meaning of such a constraint is that the equivalent circuit \nelements are expected to evolve gradually during the cure. For the estimation of the \nconsecutive spectra the objective function of equation (9) was used. The search space was \nadjusted for each spectrum according to the parameter values obtained on the preceding \nspectrum. These parameter values were set as the mean of the corresponding search range for \nthe new spectrum. Table VIII shows the ranges for all the circuit parameters. If any of the \nnewly estimated parameters were within 1% of the limits of the search space, the search space \nof all the parameters was expanded by 10% and the genetic algorithm was rerun. A schematic \nof the whole modelling methodology is shown in Figure 9. \n \nTable VIII: Adaptive search space of the fitting parameters.

The fitting results with and without regularization are illustrated in Figure 10. \nThe charge migration resistance estimation, which is the parameter with respect to which the \nimpedance data have the greatest sensitivity, is not affected by the regularization. Rion values \nchange several orders of magnitude during the cure. Similarly to Rion, Cind values are not \naffected by regularization. The dipolar resistance Rdip is very noisy when the fitting is \nperformed without regularization. The introduction of regularization reduces the noise \nsignificantly. The same is observed for Cdip. The electrode polarization parameters are more \ninfluenced by the existence of the regularization term. Fitting without regularization leads to \nvery large values of Rel. The exponent n values have a percentage difference that exceeds 40% \nin the later stages of the cure. \n \n \n \nFigure 9: Methodology for modelling consecutive spectra \n \n \n6. DISCUSSION \nChoice of suitable objective function \nThe simulation results have shown that there are minor differences between an objective \nfunction based on least squares and one based on absolute differences. The use of least \nsquares tends to give slightly better estimations of the more sensitive parameters such as Rion. \nIn contrast, when a least squares objective function is used, the estimation of the least \nsensitive parameters leads to erroneous results (for example, see Rdip and Cdip estimations in \nTable VII). The use of absolute differences gives better approximations to parameters with \nlower sensitivities such as Rdip but compromises accuracy of the estimation of parameters with \nrespect to which the model circuit shows high sensitivity. In the case of cure monitoring \nspectra, the determination of parameters with low sensitivity is important, as they contain \ninformation about the dipolar movements of the curing system [9, 10]. Dipolar movements \nare directly linked to the vitrification of thermosets [2], a very important milestone in the cure \nprocess. Therefore the use of absolute differences is considered more beneficial. The use of \nlogarithmic scaling instead of weighted residuals did not improve or worsen the simulation. \nLogarithmic scaling has the advantage that no estimation of the experimental data variance is \nneeded as input to the objective function, as is the case when weight factors are used. \n \n \nRion\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n0 30 60 90 120\nCure time (min)\nR\nio\nn\n (\nM\nO\nh\nm\n)\nRdip\n0\n30\n60\n90\n120\n150\n0 30 60 90 120\nCure time (min)\nR\ndi\np \n(M\nO\nh\nm\n)\n \n \nCind\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n0 30 60 90 120\nCure time (min)\nC\nin\nd \n(p\nF)\nCdip\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n0 30 60 90 120\nCure time (min)\nC\ndi\np \n(p\nF)\n \n \nRel\n0\n40\n80\n120\n160\n200\n0 30 60 90 120\nCure time (min)\nR\nel\n (\nM\nO\nhm\n)\nn\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0 30 60 90 120\nCure time (min)\nn\n \nFigure 10: Equivalent circuit parameters for the isothermal cure of RTM6 at 150 \u00b0C. Black points \nshow the fitting without regularization. Grey points show the fitting when the \nregularization term is added to the objective function. \n \n \nEffect of regularization \nFrom Figure 5 it is evident that regularization helps in reducing the effect of outliers in the \nestimation. This is more pronounced in the electrode polarization circuit parameters Rel and n. \nThe outliers, as shown in Figure 4, are placed in the low frequency side of the spectrum, as \nsources of noise are much more likely to affect this frequency region. Consequently, the \npresence of outliers is expected to affect electrode polarisation more severely, as the electrode \npolarisation term dominates the response of the curing system at low frequencies (see \nequations (2)-(3)) [3, 16]. \nThe presence of outliers is always a danger in cure monitoring signals, especially at \nfrequencies close to 60 Hz. Minimisation of the detrimental effects of outliers on curve fitting \nis extremely helpful in cases where the identification and elimination of outliers is not \nfeasible. One of the aims in analysing cure monitoring spectra is to automatically model \nconsecutive spectra and to use the circuit parameter values for characterising the cure. The \nenhanced robustness that the regularization offers is a step further towards this aim. \nFitting of consecutive cure monitoring spectra \nThe fitting of consecutive experimental spectra showed the potential of regularization in \ndealing with real cure experiment data. The spectrum moves continuously and slowly during \nthe cure. It is therefore expected that the circuit parameter values will change accordingly. \nThis is crucial for the regularization to work, as the expected parameter values are obtained \nfrom the fitting of the chronologically preceding spectra. In the experiment studied, the curing \nprocess takes over 100 minutes to complete (in industrial processes it can be several hours), \nwhilst the data acquisition process for the whole spectrum takes about 2 min. This implies that \nthe value changes between two consecutive impedance spectra are in the order of 2% of the \ntotal difference between the start and the end of the experiment. \nIn the estimation of Rion and Cind the use of regularization does not influence the quality of the \nestimated values. The trend is the same with the estimates obtained without regularization. \nThis is a result of the very high sensitivity of the spectra to Rion and Cind. Small changes in \nthose parameters can lead to large estimation errors. It is therefore expected that their values \nare estimated accurately with or without regularization. In the estimation of Rdip and Cdip \nsmoother data are obtained with regularization. The trend in Rdip is more clearly seen and a \nstep increase in Cdip can be resolved. The Rdip and Cdip values are less influential in the overall \nsignal. The use of regularization forces the genetic algorithm to explore values close to the \nmean (see Table VIII) without losing the ability of exploiting the whole solution search space. \nThe dipolar movements in thermosetting systems are connected with the cure induced \nvitrification [35, 36] and the product of Rdip and Cdip gives a measure of the dipolar relaxation \ntime \u03c4dip [9]. In commercial systems the presence of charge carriers obscures the effect of the \ndipoles on the signal. The proposed parameter estimation technique is able to uncover and \nmodel adequately the dipolar movements in such systems and thus offers an efficient way for \nidentifying vitrification in situ. \nThe big discrepancy in the electrode polarization circuit elements estimation can be attributed \nto the movement of the spectrum during the cure. The spectrum initially contains a frequency \nregion where electrode polarization dominates the signal. This region lies at low frequencies \nand can be identified easily in the imaginary impedance spectrum. As the spectrum moves to \nthe left, this region moves out of the frequency range of the experiment (e.g. in Figure 8, the \nminimum point cannot be seen for t > 60 min). This means that the sensitivity with respect to \nRel and n is reduced and erroneous values are obtained from the parameter estimation. \nRegularization forces the estimated values not to vary much from the values obtained in the \nprevious fit. This prevents parameters with low sensitivity from settling to abnormal values \nand thus affecting the estimation of other parameters.  \n \n \n7. CONCLUSIONS \nGenetic algorithms were used in order to estimate the values of the parameters of an \nequivalent circuit expressing the dielectric behaviour of thermosetting polymers during cure. \nThe parameters change by several orders of magnitude in value during the reaction, whilst the \nexistence of noise and outliers makes the inversion a challenging problem. \nSeveral objective functions based on least squares and absolute differences for the \nminimisation problem were tested. Absolute differences were found to be more accurate in \nmodelling cure monitoring spectra, due to their higher accuracy in estimating parameters of \nlow sensitivity. Logarithmic scaling of the experimental data worked equally well with \nweighting. \nThe robustness of absolute differences was enhanced with the incorporation of a \nregularization term in the objective function. Regularization lends itself to the inversion \nproblem at hand, as the parameter values of consecutive spectra are expected to have close \nvalues. As a result regularization using the previous solution reduces the effect of outliers and \nnoise in the modelling of experimental spectra. This enables efficient use to be made of the \nestimation algorithm in real time analysis of cure monitoring spectra.  \nThe technique presented here can discern the contribution of permanent dipoles in the \nimpedance spectrum of commercial thermosetting systems where charge carriers usually \ndominate the signal. This constitutes a significant improvement in dielectric cure monitoring \nanalysis as it overcomes the difficulties faced when knowledge built from the study of dipolar \nrelaxation phenomena in model resin formulations is transferred to the monitoring of \ncommercial thermosets.  \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \nThe work reported here was supported by an EPSRC grant GR\/R94329 and by EC GROWTH \nproject \u2018CONDICOMP\u2019 (G1RD-2001-03010) \n \n \nNOMENCLATURE \nThe symbols are given in alphabetical order \nSymbol Description \nc Adjustable parameter for adaptive mutation \nCdip Dipolar Capacitance \nCind Induced Capacitance \nf frequency \nF Fitness function \nFcritical Fitness value above which the genetic algorithm terminates \nG Number of generations \nGmax Number of maximum generation \nn Constant Phase Element exponent \nN Number of solution vectors \nNe Number of solution vectors passing directly to the next generation \nNr Number of solution vectors passing through crossover and mutation \npar Parameter values \nparexp Expected parameter values \npe Exchange probability \npm Mutation probability \nPno Number of parameters \nq Number of frequencies in a sweep \nRdip Dipolar resistance \nRel Constant Phase Element parameter \nRion Ionic resistance \nS Objective function \nt Time \nw Weight factor \nZ Complex impedance \nZ\u0384 Real impedance \nZ\u0384\u0384 Imaginary impedance \n\u03bb Tikhonov regularization parameter \n\u03c9 Angular frequency \n\u03c4dip Dipolar relaxation time \nZCPE Complex impedance of the Constant Phase Element (CPE) \n \n \nREFERENCES \n1.
