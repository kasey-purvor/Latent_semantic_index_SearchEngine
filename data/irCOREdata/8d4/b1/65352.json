ALEXANDER BENTLEY, KATHARINE COX, NANCY TAYLES,\nCHARLES HIGHAM, COLIN MACPHERSON, MATTHEW COOPER,\nAND TINA E. F. HAYES\nIn this study we compare isotopes in human teeth with burial artifacts at\na Bronze Age site in Thailand, to identify immigrants and delimit discrete social\ngroups. One of the aims of the Origins of Angkor Archaeological Project is to as-\nsess seminal aspects of the social, cultural, and technological development in the\nMun River valley of Northeast Thailand. Ranging from the Neolithic through\nthe Bronze Age to the Iron Age, multiple archaeological sites and cemeteries of\nthis valley document the development of human society from simple agrarian ori-\ngins to a complex, hierarchical, and specialized society, culminating in the Angkor\ncivilization.\nOne of these sites, Ban Lum Khao, settled during the late Neolithic, was used\nas a cemetery in the Bronze Age, after 1200 b.c. The cemetery, of which 110\ngraves were uncovered, appears to show all the indications of an undi\u00a4erentiated,\nalmost egalitarian community, rarely showing any significant di\u00a4erences in the\ngoods included with female, male, or even child burials, whether it be pottery\nforms, pig bones, spindle whorls, shell beads, or bangles (Higham and O\u2019Reilly\n2004; O\u2019Reilly 1999). There was also no significant di\u00a4erentiation based on loca-\ntion within the cemetery. The burials at Ban Lum Khao suggest an egalitarian\ncommunity, although bearing in mind that archaeological burials may reflect\npeople\u2019s personal idiosyncrasies as much as generalities of their society, that ceme-\nteries might be subdivided by social class or status, and also that absence of evi-\ndence for inequality in burials does not mean it did not exist (e.g., Ames 2007;\nUcko 1969).\nThe site of Ban Non Wat, about 20 km west of Ban Lum Khao, shows clear\nevidence of inequality during the initial two phases of the Bronze Age, when\nR.

A comparison be-\ntween the form of the ceramic vessels from these two phases at Ban Non Wat\nand the earlier of the two phases of definite Bronze Age burials at Ban Lum Khao\nstrongly suggests contemporaneity. Hence, within a short distance, one set of\ninterments were outstandingly wealthy while their contemporaries were poor.\nThis is a clear indication that egalitarianism, at least in mortuary treatment if not\nin social status, was not universal during this period in the Mun River valley. By\nthe Iron Age, there was marked inequality in the Mun Valley, at the site of\nNoen-U-Loke (c. 300 b.c.\u2013a.d. 600), near Ban Non Wat, where the 126 burials\nshow multiple signs of inequality, including gold items, as well as expert craft spe-\ncializations (bronze, iron, glass), and exotic ornaments (agate beads), and large\nqualities of domestic rice.\nThe evidence from Ban Lum Khao and Ban Non Wat reveals two contempo-\nrary groups of early Bronze Age burials, one very rich, the other relatively poor.\nThis might reflect sampling bias, since the excavation at Ban Lum Khao was\nlocated on the periphery of the mound, whereas at Ban Non Wat it was in the\ncenter. Nevertheless, Ban Lum Khao might equally represent a society without\nthe inequality, specialization, and competition that was present nearby and cer-\ntainly during later periods. Whether Ban Lum Khao was exceptional or indica-\ntive, the site provides an excellent opportunity to look for the \u2018\u2018seeds\u2019\u2019 of social\ncomplexity in the Mun Valley.\nFig. 1\nThe Mun Valley lies in the seasonally arid portion of Thailand, dominated by\nscrub and woodland, with well-weathered alluvial and regolith soils (Boyd and\nMcGrath 2001). The pollen sequence at Noen-U-Loke (Boyd and McGrath\n2001), about 20 km from Ban Lum Khao, reflects an open landscape with rice\npresent throughout the occupation period, from a managed landscape of rice cul-\ntivation and modified woodlands in its earliest phase, to an increase of woodland\nat the expense of rice in later phases (Boyd and McGrath 2001). The sequence at\nBan Non Wat, just 1 km to the east of Noen-U-Loke is similar, except for a shift\nfrom wet to dry conditions that may reflect local alterations during the occupa-\ntion of Ban Non Wat (Boyd and McGrath 2001).\nSkeletons from multiple sites in prehistoric Thailand from c. 2000 b.c. to c. 400\nb.c. show a substantial increase in the rate of major long bone fracture from the\nNeolithic (0.3%) to the Bronze Age (3.0%), which may reflect a change in subsis-\ntence activities such as land clearance for the intensification of rice agriculture\n(Domett and Tayles 2006). Evidence for craniofacial fractures suggests possible in-\nterpersonal violence, including a few individuals from Ban Lum Khao (Domett\n2004 : 131).\nThe aim of this article is to address the question of the structure of the society\nat Ban Lum Khao. We hypothesize that the egalitarian nature of the society\nreflects a kinship-based community. We test this by using isotopic evidence to\nsee whether the individuals were all local or whether there were immigrants\nin the cemetery sample who might be expected to have contributed to a more\ndiverse social structure.\nasian perspectives . 48(1) . spring 200980\n(AutoPDF V7 9\/3\/09 13:43) UHP (7\"!10\") Bembo J-2095 Asian Perspectives, 48:1 PMU: WSL 05\/03\/2009 pp. 79\u201397 2095_48-1_04 (p. 80)\nban lum khao\nThe site of Ban Lum Khao consists of thin occupation layers and a cemetery com-\nprising three phases: late Neolithic\/transitional Bronze (twelfth century b.c.),\nearly Bronze Age, (tenth century b.c.) and late Bronze Age (seventh century\nb.c.).

Excavations in 1995\u20131996, now de-\nscribed in a monograph (Higham and Thosarat 2004), uncovered an area of 15\nby 10 m to a depth of 1.85 m, which was divided into three layers. At the top was\nan occupation layer incorporating a series of pits rich in organic remains, fre-\nquently modern, including fish, shellfish, mammalian bones, turtles, and much\npottery. The second layer incorporated the three mortuary phases with some\ngraves cut well into the natural substrate. Below this was layer 3, a late Neolithic\noccupation, with a dense shell midden, potsherds, and ash-filled hearths.\nDomestic animals at Ban Lum Khao include pigs, cattle, and dogs. Wild water\nbu\u00a4alo and deer were likely hunted, and fish and shellfish collected. Wet sieving\nand flotation during the excavation recovered the remains of freshwater fish,\nfrogs, turtles, birds, and small mammals. The fish from early contexts are signifi-\ncantly larger than their modern counterparts (Thosarat 2004). Larger bones from\nlayer 3 include the wild water bu\u00a4alo, many middle-sized deer that probably\ncome from Cervus eldi, some large pig bones and a few bones from the domestic\ndog (Higham 2004). Both wild water bu\u00a4alo and deer bones became rare in layer\n2, while domestic-sized cattle and pigs proliferate.\nThe Burials\nExcavations at Ban Lum Khao (BLK) in 1995\u20131996 uncovered the burials of 110\nindividuals, including males, females, children, and infants laid out in what may\nhave been rows, typical of the Bronze Age in central and northeastern Thailand.\nThe adults were interred with the preferred orientation of the head to the south-\neast (Fig. 2). Virtually all the infant jar burials were found beyond the head of an\nadult.\nThe burials have been subdivided into three mortuary phases (MP) based\non location, depth, orientation, superposition, and grave goods (Higham and\nThosarat 2004 : 23). Most adult burials contained pottery, and over 400 complete\npottery vessels were recovered from the burials, including footed jars identical to\nthose recovered from Ban Prasat, with cord-marked, red-slipped, and burnished\nbodies, broadly flaring at the top (O\u2019Reilly 2004). O\u2019Reilly (1999, 2004) catego-\nrized the pottery into 15 forms, based on overall vessel shape and key attributes.\nOf particular interest (as discussed below) are pottery forms 1 and 1A. Form 1A,\nprobably a serving vessel, is a small red-slipped open bowl with a pedestal base.\nForm 1, possibly a simplification of Form 1A, is the same bowl but without the\npedestal, among the simplest pottery from the site. Form 1A is found among\nmales, females, and children, whereas Form 1 was found predominantly with\nfemales (n \u00bc 7) with only one occurrence among males (Higham and O\u2019Reilly\n2004). Another important pottery type for this study is the Form 5 group (5A\u2013\n5E), consisting of pots with an ellipsoid body and conical neck, probably cooking\npots. Form 5A, introduced in MP 2, is the most common and was distributed\namong females, males and children around the cemetery (Higham and O\u2019Reilly\n2004). Late burials feature a range of forms, in which the upper part of the body\nof the pot is cylindrical in form, rather than everted (O\u2019Reilly 2004). Some of the\npottery and its decoration may recall that from the cemetery of Non Nok Tha\n(Higham 2002).\nasian perspectives . 48(1) . spring 200982\n(AutoPDF V7 9\/3\/09 13:43) UHP (7\"!10\") Bembo J-2095 Asian Perspectives, 48:1 PMU: WSL 05\/03\/2009 pp. 79\u201397 2095_48-1_04 (p. 82)\nGrave o\u00a4erings also included bangles of marine shell (trochus and conus) and\nmarble (Chang 2004). Other items included stone adzes, cord-marked cylinders\nof rice-tempered clay, pellet-bow pellets, fragments of clay bovid figurines, shell\ndisc beads, freshwater bivalve shellfish, pig, and fish bones, sandstone abraders\nand bone implements that resemble the so-called \u2018\u2018shuttles\u2019\u2019 from Khok Phanom\nDi. Although no bronze artifacts were found with any of the 110 burials, certain\ngraves from MP 2 contained the remains of crucibles, molds, and corroded frag-\nments of bronze. Overall, the shell and stone ornaments, clay bivalve mold cast-\ning technology and the clay figurines fit within the traditions of other Bronze\nAge sites on the Khorat Plateau and in central Thailand.\nIn terms of burial goods and apparent wealth of individuals, Ban Lum Khao es-\nsentially lacks marked di\u00a4erentiation, and there was no identifiable group signifi-\ncantly wealthier than another (Higham et al. 2004). There are no spatial patterns\nwith pottery forms or other artifact forms among the burials, and no significant\nwealth di\u00a4erences according to age, stature, or putative cemetery row (Higham\nand O\u2019Reilly 2004). The grave goods do not show any definitive signs of a divi-\nsion of labor, as utilitarian items such as abraders, spindle whorls, and anvils were\nfound with men, women, and children alike.\nThere were some subtler di\u00a4erences, however, that suggest social and\/or age-\nrelated di\u00a4erences within the community. In MP 2, the early Bronze Age phase,\nFig. 2. The Ban Lum Khao cemetery.\nbentley et al. . community diversity at ban lum khao, thailand 83\n(AutoPDF V7 9\/3\/09 13:43) UHP (7\"!10\") Bembo J-2095 Asian Perspectives, 48:1 PMU: WSL 05\/03\/2009 pp. 79\u201397 2095_48-1_04 (p. 83)\nthere were slightly more artifacts per burial (6.1 vs. 4.4) among adult females than\nadult males, with the \u2018\u2018richest\u2019\u2019 four adult MP2 burials (Burials 21, 42, 52, 85) be-\ning those of females aged 20\u201335 years (Higham and O\u2019Reilly 2004: fig. 12 : 26).\nCopper, bivalve molds and adzes were all found more often with children than\nwith adult men or women, abraders more often with adult women, where they\nappeared along with adzes.\nThe Skeletons\nAmong the 110 individuals, 61 contained articulated or partly articulated skele-\ntons, 35 were disturbed or scattered, and 14 contained infant jar burials (Domett\n2004). Domett (2001; 2004) identified 51 children (<15 years old) and 59 adults,\nwhich is approximately the ratio expected for a cemetery sample representative of\nthe population. The female survival rate, between 20 and 29 years of age, is only\nhalf that of males, which suggests both a fairly low fertility and a high risk of\ndeath during childbirth among BLK females (Domett 2004). The relative lack of\nolder females as compared with older males (Table 1) is one of several notable dif-\nferences between the sexes. Domett (2004) finds that BLK males had a more ex-\ntreme variation in stature, a greater prevalence of osteoarthritis, osteophytosis, and\ntraumatic bone fractures. While this partly reflects the higher number of older\nmales in the sample, the di\u00a4erence is enough to suggest that males engaged in\nmore rigorous and weight-bearing activities than females. This could be asso-\nciated with gender-based di\u00a4erences in diet, as females have a significantly greater\nprevalence of caries (Table 2). Hence one possibility is that males engaged in\nhunting and females had a more starch-based diet (Domett 2004). Domett (2004)\nTable 1.

The technique is based on the fact that strontium\nisotope signatures (87Sr\/86Sr) in tooth enamel derives from the biologically avail-\nable strontium of the region, which at least partly reflects the geologic material\nwhere the diet was obtained during childhood (when the enamel was forming).\nGiven the local variability in soils, rocks, and plants (e.g., Bentley 2006; Capo\net al. 1998; Sillen et al. 1998), the best way to \u2018\u2018map\u2019\u2019 the prehistoric, biologi-\ncally available 87Sr\/86Sr values is to sample it directly, in the tooth enamel of local\nanimals from archaeological sites around the study area (Bentley 2006; Bentley\nand Knipper 2005). Local animals do a wonderful job of averaging the 87Sr\/86Sr\nin their feeding area (Burton et al. 1999).\nMapping the biologically available isotope signatures is a long-term project\ninvolving strontium- and oxygen-isotope analysis of hundreds of archaeological\nfaunal samples from the region (cf. Bentley 2006). As this is our first study in the\nMun Valley, our isotopic map is a work in progress, and we base our preliminary\nexpectations on the regional geology. Ban Lum Khao is situated on the southern\nportion of the Khorat Plateau, which covers about 180,000 km2 and comprises\neight sandstones and shale formations ranging from the early Jurassic to late Cre-\ntaceous, overlain by 100 Ma evaporites of halite and anhydrite (the Maha Sarak-\nham formation), which in turn is conformably overlain by the Tertiary non-\nmarine mudstones of the Phutok Formation (Charusiri et al. 2006; Timofeef\net al. 2006; Workman 1977). The sandstones are mainly fluvial, up to 5 km thick,\nconsisting of continental, clastic sediments (including metamorphic detritus, acid\nand intermediate volcanic clasts), which, as paleocurrent indicators show, were\noriginally transported by large braided river systems flowing out of the northeast\nduring the Triassic to Cretaceous eras (Carter and Bristow 2003; Timofeef et al.\n2006). Within the Khorat group, the Khok Kruat Formation contains red arkose\nsandstones (Charusiri et al. 2006), which can have quite high 87Sr\/86Sr (>0.710),\nas reflected in the local human values at Ban Chiang (Bentley et al. 2005). In con-\ntrast, the evaporite formation, probably created by ocean flooding during the\nCretaceous (Timofeef et al. 2006), should contribute a 87Sr\/86Sr signature of Cre-\ntaceous seawater, or about 0.7070\u20130.7075. Hence we can expect a diverse range\nof 87Sr\/86Sr ratios from the Khorat Plateau, anywhere from 0.7075\u20130.709 wher-\never weathered Maha Sarakham evaporates are the major source to the soil solu-\ntions, to above 0.7115 over outcrops of the red sandstones of the Khok Kruat\nFormation.\nBeyond the Khorat Plateau, we expect the highest 87Sr\/86Sr ratios from the\nTriassic\/Jurassic granitoid belts distributed throughout Thailand, which would be\nthe likely source of much higher 87Sr\/86Sr ratios (Beckinsale et al. 1979; Charusiri\net al. 1993). The Khao Daen granites, for example, which outcrop near the west-\nern coast of Thailand, have whole rock 87Sr\/86Sr values ranging between 0.749\nand 0.820, while the Hub Kapong Triassic granite complex, southwest of Khok\nPhanom Di in the northern Thai Peninsula, has whole-rock 87Sr\/86Sr values of\n0.775\u20130.789 (Beckinsale et al. 1979).\nSo far, from prehistoric Thailand we have human and animal isotopic signa-\nasian perspectives . 48(1) . spring 200986\n(AutoPDF V7 9\/3\/09 13:43) UHP (7\"!10\") Bembo J-2095 Asian Perspectives, 48:1 PMU: WSL 05\/03\/2009 pp. 79\u201397 2095_48-1_04 (p. 86)\ntures from several sites, including Ban Chiang on the Khorat Plateau (Bentley\net al. 2005), and Khok Phanom Di near the coast near modern Bangkok (Bentley\net al. 2007). The 87Sr\/86Sr range at Ban Chiang should be close to 0.712, judging\nby the clustered values from sedentary females as well as two archaeological dogs\nFig. 3.

Indicative of this variability, values from two dogs and\ntwo deer from Ban Na Di (a site near to, and contemporary with Ban Chiang)\nsuggest a possible local 87Sr\/86Sr ratio of 0.7116, but also that localized values as\nlow as 0.7094 and as high as 0.714 may not be far away. At Khok Phanom Di,\nthe local 87Sr\/86Sr is just slightly above the seawater value of 0.7092, as expected\nat a coastal site. We are acquiring new data from Noen-U-Loke, a few km from\nBan Lum Khao, where local 87Sr\/86Sr ratios among humans appear to lie between\n0.7096 and 0.7099.\nCarbon isotopes 12C and 13C fractionate during primary production of organic\nmatter, such that C3 plants (e.g., rice) have d\n13C (relative to the Pee Dee Belemite\n[PDB] carbonate standard) values between $23 and $34 (e.g., Heaton 1999). For\nsettlements of the Mun Valley, given their similar levels of temperature, humid-\nity, insolation, altitude, and forest cover\u2014all of which have secondary e\u00a4ects on\nd13C in plants (e.g. Heaton 1999)\u2014the d13C we measure in tooth carbonate\nshould reflect the di\u00a4ering amounts of marine foods, meat and\/or plant foods (C3\nvs. C4) in the diet (Ambrose et al. 1997; DeNiro and Epstein 1978). King (2006)\nhas already found the collagen preservation in BLK bones to be poor, so we mea-\nsured d13C in the tooth enamel apatite, which reflects d13C in the whole diet,\nenriched by 9.4 (Ambrose et al. 1997). This di\u00a4erence of 4.4 is very nearly what\nwe found when comparing our enamel d13C value from BLK 49 ($14.05) to the\ncollagen value ($17.9) retrieved by King (2006: appendix C3) on the same indi-\nvidual. At BLK, e\u00a4ects on d13C variations could include: (a) consumption of\nfreshwater fish, the remains of which show it was an important food at Ban Lum\nKhao (Thosarat 2004); (b) terrestrial meat consumption, as d13C increases by\nabout one per mil per trophic level (DeNiro and Epstein 1978); (c) forest density,\nwhereby plants growing beneath a dense forest canopy have d13C values several\nper mil more negative than similar plants in cleared areas (Heaton 1999); and (d)\naltitude, whereby high-altitude plants (above 1000 m, adapted to lower partial\npressure of CO2) tend to be enriched in\n13C by a few per mil (Ko\u00a8rner et al.\n1991).\nOxygen isotope compositions (d18O, relative to Standard Mean Ocean Water\n[SMOW]) in mammalian enamel is often reflective of geographic origins (e.g.,\nBalasse et al. 2002; Budd et al. 2004; Kohn 1996). Determined largely by temper-\nature, the mean annual d18O in precipitation depends on latitude and altitude\n(Bowen and Wilkinson 2002), and also on topographic relief, distance from large\nbodies of water, and relative humidity. In humans from settled communities,\nwhose water supply is more consistent, the variations in tooth enamel d18O are\ntypically about 1 (Budd et al. 2004). In Southeast Asia, geographic variation of\nd18O in prehistoric human enamel may not be systematic enough to resolve\nhuman communities (cf. Bentley et al. 2005; Krigbaum 2003). Nevertheless, in\ntheory, we may expect 18O generally to be depleted in enamel from people from\nhigher altitudes and greater distance from the sea, as rain clouds will be depleted\nprogressively in heavy oxygen as they move upland and inland. As King (2006)\npoints out, there is a rain shadow e\u00a4ect as the monsoon rains move into Thailand;\nmost of their water is precipitated before reaching the Khorat Plateau, where the\nleast rain falls in the west and center.\nasian perspectives . 48(1) . spring 200988\n(AutoPDF V7 9\/3\/09 13:44) UHP (7\"!10\") Bembo J-2095 Asian Perspectives, 48:1 PMU: WSL 05\/03\/2009 pp. 79\u201397 2095_48-1_04 (p. 88)\nprocedures\nWe measured strontium, carbon and oxygen isotopes in tooth enamel from\nselected human skeletons, with sampling preference for the second molar (crown\ncomplete between ages 7\u20138 years [Hillson 1997 : 123]) or third molar (ages 12\u2013\n16) wherever possible. Many studies indicate that buried prehistoric bone tends\nto be contaminated from groundwater strontium, so while human bone may help\nidentify the local 87Sr\/86Sr value at the site, we focus our analyses on the tooth\nenamel, which robustly resists isotopic contamination (e.g., Hoppe et al. 2003;\nTrickett et al. 2003).\nUsing our standard procedure, we purified enamel samples through columns of\nSr-spec resin, and analyzed 87Sr\/86Sr by mass spectrometry at the National Ocean-\nography Centre (NOC), Southampton, and also at the Arthur Holmes Isotope\nGeology Laboratory, Durham University. We then measured d18O and d13C in\nthe carbonate (CO3) component of the tooth enamel (cf.

Almost certainly, the majority of these individuals re-\nflect origins within the Mun Valley.\nThe two most extreme 87Sr\/86Sr ratios are from MP 1. With all the other BLK\nvalues between 0.709 and 0.710, the 87Sr\/86Sr ratios from MP 1 Burials 64\n(0.71129) and 44 (0.70685) are clear outliers, even compared with values at\nNoen-U-Loke, suggesting these two individuals may have immigrated from out-\nside the Mun Valley. The 87Sr\/86Sr ratio from Burial 64 (adult female) is consis-\ntent with sites in the Songkhram Basin, farther north on the Khorat Plateau, such\nas Ban Chiang and Ban Na Di (Bentley et al. 2005), whereas the anomalously low\nratio from Burial 44 (adult male) suggests a province of basaltic lavas, possibly the\nmajor outcrops east of the Mekong River, in Laos and Cambodia (Workman\n1977). These two burials are also unique among our BLK sample as they feature\ntype 10 as either the only or the predominant pottery vessel (>60%).\nTwo other burials with non-local 87Sr\/86Sr ratios are Burials 19 and 49, both\nfemale. Burial 49 (0.70948), from MP 3, was the only one with pottery types 9\nand 15, contained a clay potter\u2019s anvil, and may have been significantly later than\nthe rest of the BLK burials (Higham and Mather 2004). Burial 19 (0.70917), from\nMP 2, also had the lowest d18O of the BLK sample (24.16) and distinctive pottery\nforms.\nGroups of socially distinct women?\nAmong the females, the isotopic values clearly correlate with certain burial goods,\nparticularly pottery type, found in the grave. Burials with pottery types 1 (1 and\/\nor 1A) had significantly higher 87Sr\/86Sr than the rest of the group ( p < 0.004,\ntwo-tailed t-test), five of which have 87Sr\/86Sr ratios above 0.7098. The three\nsampled females associated with both pot types 1 and 1A (Burials 17, 21, 42)\nhave virtually identical 87Sr\/86Sr ratios (0.70989e 0.00001) and similar d18O\nvalues (25.7\u201326.5). Only two other BLK burials contained both these pottery\nstyles, one of which (Burial 85) had no teeth to sample, and the other (Burial 82)\nwas a male. All three of these females had bangles, and in fact all but one of the\nfemales with 87Sr\/86Sr above 0.70990 had a bangle in the burial, a significant pat-\ntern ( p < 0.03, t-test). Burial 19 also had a bangle (Table 3), so females with both\npottery type 1 and bangles tend to have non-local 87Sr\/86Sr ratios, with only one\nexception (Burial 82).\nFocusing on the females just from MP 2, the correlation between pottery types\nand isotopic signature is further illustrated by plots of 87Sr\/86Sr vs. d13C and 87Sr\/\n86Sr vs. d18O. As shown in Figure 5, if we designate the burial just by the most\nnumerous pottery type, the females with pottery types 1 (1, 1A) group quite dis-\ntinctly from those with pottery types 5 (5A\u20135E).\nGiven these correlations between pottery type and isotopic signatures among\nthe females, it is notable that such correlations are not apparent among the\nmales (Figure 6). There is also no noticeable pattern with bangles: three of the\nsampled males had bangles (Burials 67, 82, 89), and their 87Sr\/86Sr ratios\n(0.70969\u20130.70975) are no di\u00a4erent from the mean value for the whole BLK\nsample.\nasian perspectives . 48(1) . spring 200990\n(AutoPDF V7 9\/3\/09 13:44) UHP (7\"!10\") Bembo J-2095 Asian Perspectives, 48:1 PMU: WSL 05\/03\/2009 pp. 79\u201397 2095_48-1_04 (p. 90)\nFig. 6.

Their\nvalues are nonetheless quite di\u00a4erent, indicating these two individuals immigrated\nfrom di\u00a4erent communities. One of these, Burial 44, has the only example of\nworked antler at the site, and a similar, Neolithic find at Ban Kao in Kanchana-\nburi Province, western Thailand, was suggested to show a southern Chinese in-\nfluence (S\u00f8rensen and Hatting 1966 : 143). Hence the valley may have attracted\noriginal settlers from di\u00a4erent locations. In fact, the larger component of the early\nfaunal assemblage suggests that the inhabitants entered new territory and exploited\nthe many wild animals they encountered. Ban Non Wat has earlier occupation\nbut maybe that reflects very localized initial settlement.\nAmong all the other individuals whose 87Sr\/86Sr ratios lie between 0.7096 and\n0.7100, none need have a distant origin, and it is most parsimonious to assume\nthey were all from within the Mun Valley. The main range of 87Sr\/86Sr ratios\nat Noen-U-Loke (0.7096\u20130.7099), for example, is quite similar to that at BLK,\nmaking it di\u2030cult to distinguish these communities by strontium isotope signa-\nture alone. In our very preliminary e\u00a4orts to map 87Sr\/86Sr in the region using\narchaeological pig teeth, the sites of Ban Lum Khao, Noen-U-Loke, and Ban\nNon Wat (Fig. 1) so far have yielded indistinguishable local 87Sr\/86Sr values, be-\ntween 0.70979 and 0.70995 (n \u00bc 4). However, even if we succeed at resolving the\nmap to the community scale, the scale of personal mobility is likely to be larger,\nsince many of the sites in the Mun Valley are within a day\u2019s walk of each other.\nHence any clusters within this general local range of 87Sr\/86Sr ratios (0.7096\u2013\n0.7099) become all the more notable.\nEven while the isotopic \u2018\u2018map\u2019\u2019 of the Mun Valley is being fleshed out over the\nlong term, the isotope data from BLK already provide several novel indications\nconcerning social grouping. Specifically, among the BLK females, indicators of\nchildhood origin (87Sr\/86Sr d13O) and diet (d13C) are associated with bangles and\nthe most frequent pottery type in the burial. A particularly notable pattern is that\nthe females with 87Sr\/86Sr above 0.70990 (presumably non-local) appear to have\nidentified themselves with pottery types 1 and 1A and bangles.\nAmong males, however, there were no such correlations between isotope\nvalues and pottery type. The simplest explanation for this is that, in terms of social\nidentity, pottery was more important to females than to males, as suggested else-\nwhere in the world (Peregrine 2004). Possibly, females immigrated from nearby\ncommunities, each with its own pottery tradition, which is further suggested if\nwe include Burials 19 and 49, also female non-locals with distinctive pottery\nforms. Under a patrilocal kinship system, this is a normal pattern. Notably, the\nwomen of each isotope group were distributed in di\u00a4erent parts of the cemetery,\nwhich could reflect their di\u00a4erent respective marriages. It seems unlikely that this\ncemetery was shared among di\u00a4erent communities, given the propensity for liv-\ning in discrete communities with the cemetery intermingled with occupation\nin this well-populated valley (cf. Welch and McNeill 1991). Interestingly, the\n87Sr\/86Sr ratios from the pottery 1\/1A females (0.70988\u20130.70991) are essentially\nasian perspectives . 48(1) . spring 200992\n(AutoPDF V7 9\/3\/09 13:44) UHP (7\"!10\") Bembo J-2095 Asian Perspectives, 48:1 PMU: WSL 05\/03\/2009 pp. 79\u201397 2095_48-1_04 (p. 92)\nthe same as a group at nearby Noen-U-Loke (0.70986\u20130.70990). Perhaps these\nreflect the same location, as future studies may reveal.\nThe d13C variation is subtle\u2014about 1 \u2014so we cannot be certain whether the\nvariation reflects amounts of fish or rice in the diet, for example, or some of the\nsecondary e\u00a4ects on d13C, mentioned above. Notably, the males and females fall\nalong di\u00a4erent mixing arrays on a plot of 87Sr\/86Sr vs. d13C (Fig. 4a). This perhaps\nreflects di\u00a4erent subsistence emphases\u2014fisherfolk versus rice cultivators, for ex-\nample. Other evidence suggests that the Mun Valley was culturally integrated, as\nthere are similarities in material culture and mortuary ritual at Ban Lum Khao,\nBan Prasat and Noen U-Loke, and Ban Non Wat.\nAs is often the case with large mounded sites, 150 m2 of excavation, though\nlarge, is still only a very small sample of the Ban Lum Khao site (Higham and\nThosarat 2007: fig. 4 : 1). Hence the relative homogeneity in burial \u2018\u2018wealth\u2019\u2019 at\nBLK, or the di\u00a4erences between sexes, could merely reflect sampling bias. Perhaps\nthe excavation happened to uncover only a special subgroup within the larger Ban\nLum Khao community. In any case, we have characterized this group, however\nrepresentative it turns out to be, and we present our results hopefully, that is, as a\nmotivation for future researchers to conduct further excavation and similar analysis\nat Ban Lum Khao and\/or other contemporaneous sites of the Mun Valley region.\nconclusions\nPrehistoric complex societies developed with the di\u00a4erentiation of people into\ndistinct yet interconnected groups\u2014not just in terms of the specialization of their\nactivities, but also their social identities. This complexity has to begin with some-\nthing, and kinship provides one of the surest means of di\u00a4erentiation in egalitar-\nian society (e.g., Fox 1983). Craft specializations and exchange networks would\nmost easily develop along contacts already established through lines of kinship,\nwhich govern the social identities, division of labor, and exchange of marriage\npartners in virtually all pre-complex societies.\nA window onto this process is provided by the isotopic analyses of the human\nburials at Ban Lum Khao, where the isotope evidence appears to reveal distinct\ngroups of women raised in di\u00a4erent communities, each associated with particular\npottery types. Since this is not a pattern among males, it probably reflects a patri-\nlocal marriage system, with marriages between villages within the Mun Valley. It\ncould be that this limited scope of exogamy persisted through time, as there are\ndental indicators of close genetic relatedness at Noen-U-Loke by the Iron Age\n(Nelsen et al. 2001). Possibly, we are seeing signs of moderate social di\u00a4erentia-\ntion despite kinship exchange with other communities, but without strong evi-\ndence of status di\u00a4erentiation. This is despite the large variation in male stature\nfound by Domett. The basis of this remains an enigma.\nAt first glance, our hypothesis that the apparently egalitarian society at Ban\nLum Khao is reflective of close kinship is not upheld by this result, as there are\nclearly immigrants in the community. Nonetheless these immigrants, although\ndi\u00a4erentiated by the style of grave goods, were not di\u00a4erentiated by the quantity\n(or quality, although this is more di\u2030cult to assess) of goods.\nIf Ban Lum Khao is representative of the very early origins of complex society\nin the Mun Valley, then such early social and possibly kin-based di\u00a4erentiation,\nbentley et al. . community diversity at ban lum khao, thailand 93\n(AutoPDF V7 9\/3\/09 13:44) UHP (7\"!10\") Bembo J-2095 Asian Perspectives, 48:1 PMU: WSL 05\/03\/2009 pp. 79\u201397 2095_48-1_04 (p. 93)\namid an otherwise egalitarian economy, may represent the seeds from which\ncomplexity in the Mun Valley developed over subsequent centuries. An ethos of\nexogamy and in-migration, as well as increased local specialization and external\nexchange, might have been important catalysts in the development of the types\nof regional power centers and status di\u00a4erentiation that herald the emergence of\nearly chiefdoms and states in Southeast Asian Bronze Age and Iron Age societies.\nIn suggesting how human activity shaped longer-term social structure, our results\nare compatible with Interpretive archaeological theory (Gardner 2007; Shanks\n2007), along with views that the movement of women of di\u00a4erent social group-\nings into new communities facilitated the expansion of inter-community exchange\nduring the development of socially ranked and politically complex communities.\nreferences cited\nAmbrose, Stanley H., B.
