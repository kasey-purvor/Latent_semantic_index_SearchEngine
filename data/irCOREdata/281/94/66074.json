The comparison reveals that the US system of bringing \nclaims first to the investigative\u2014but non-adjudicative\u2014Equal Employment Opportunities \nCommission (EEOC) and then to the US Federal Courts takes more time and money, but results \noften in higher compensation, than does the UK system involving conciliation by the Advisory, \nConciliation, and Arbitration Service (ACAS) before resort to the Employment Tribunals.  From \nthis difference appears to follow a much greater enthusiasm, even desperation, for ADR in \nemployment discrimination in the US than in the UK.  This piece suggests that the UK may not \nneed ADR, as the US clearly does, because of different overall approaches and attitudes to \nremediation of employment discrimination in the two countries.  \n \n1. INTRODUCTION \nThe US and UK both have witnessed a rise, over the last decade, in the amount of \nscholarship and legislation about the use of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) to \nresolve employment disputes. However, when it comes to employment discrimination, \nthe growth does not reflect a homogeneous Anglo-American trend. The discourse about \nADR in employment discrimination in the UK appears to have a flavour all its own, and \ndoes not necessarily share the strong motivations and varied directions driving the US \nADR debate.    \nThis piece looks at what might be learned from the fact that, in these two nations \nwith similar substantive employment discrimination protections and dissimilar formal \nsystems to enforce them, the popularity of ADR has grown to different degrees, in \ndifferent forms, and for different reasons. The article begins with a comparison of the \nformal systems for resolving employment discrimination disputes in the US and UK. It \nthen compares the methods of ADR used or advocated in the two countries, with some \nattention to the efficacy and pervasiveness of the various techniques. It addresses also \njustifications advanced by parties, practitioners, academics, and legislatures for using \nspecific types of ADR.   \nIt will not escape notice that the US occupies more space in this piece than does \nthe UK.  This emphasis was not intended. Instead, it results from the fact that the quantity \nand complexity of formal and alternative processes for resolving employment disputes in \nthe US exceeds that of the UK. Comparison highlights the elaborate responses of US \nparticipants to their more burdensome procedures, as against the relative satisfaction of \nUK participants with their speedier and less expensive ones. \n                                                 \n\u2217 BA, JD (St Louis), BCL (Oxon), Lecturer in Law at the University of Plymouth, and Attorney at the Bars of Missouri, \nIllinois, and the US Federal Courts. I am very grateful to Professor Christopher McCrudden and the late Dr Sally Ball for their \ncomments on a draft of this article. \nThe article concludes that different ADR preferences not only reflect different \nprocedural contexts, but may in fact result from different attitudes about employment \ndiscrimination prevention, and from a tension between the aims of individual access to \njustice on one hand, and remedial impact through the full process of law on the other. \nIndeed, this comparison implies that the use of private causes of action to deter \nemployment discrimination may hamper the ability of those same causes of action to \nprovide accessible and satisfying remedies. This leads to some cynicism about whether \nthe US and the UK can meaningfully borrow techniques from one another, but the \ncomparison nevertheless yields valuable directions for further inquiry into the \nramifications of these differences in objectives. \n2. SUBSTANTIVE EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION LAW IN THE US & UK \nSeveral US federal statutes, taken together, prohibit discrimination in the terms and \nconditions of employment, including pay, on the bases of race, gender, religion, national \norigin, age, and disability.1 Until 1991, these statutes provided for a cause of action in \nwhich the courts could award back pay and injunctive relief, such as an order to stop \ndiscriminating, or to reinstate an improperly discharged employee.2 These purely \nequitable remedies did not call for a jury trial.3 The Civil Rights Act of 1991 made \namendments to several federal anti-discrimination (in employment) statutes such that \nremedies now include compensatory (ie, pain and suffering) damages and punitive \ndamages. These damages are capped, but the caps range between $50,000 and $300,000 \neach for compensatory and punitive damages depending on the size of the employer.4 \nThese changes also entitle plaintiffs to demand a jury trial. Today, victims of \nemployment discrimination across the US have the right (eventually) to ask a federal jury \nto award as much as $300,000 in pain and suffering damages, and $300,000 in punitive \ndamages per claim.  \nAlmost all of the 50 US states have their own anti-discrimination statutes, many \nof which afford unlimited punitive and compensatory damages. As a practical matter \nmost claims under such statutes are litigated through the federal procedure, for reasons \nthe explanation of which exceed the scope of this piece. This means that (1) federal \ndamages caps often have no effect when the plaintiff joins her federal claim to a claim \nunder a state statute without damages caps and (2) one can meaningfully (albeit not \nexhaustively) study employment discrimination law in the US without worrying too \nmuch about state court and ADR systems. Taking into account state claims litigated in \nthe federal system, then, US employment discrimination law proscribes discrimination on \nthe bases of race, gender, religion, national origin, age, and disability, and affords the \nplaintiff a federal jury trial, with the potential, in many cases, for unlimited state punitive \nand compensatory damages.   \n                                                 \n1 Title VII, Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 USC s 2000e-5 et seq (\u2018Title VII\u2019); Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 USC s 1981; Equal \nPay Act, 29 USC s 206(d) (\u2018EPA\u2019); Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 USC s 621 et seq (\u2018ADEA\u2019); Americans With \nDisabilities Act, 42 USC s 12101 et seq (\u2018ADA\u2019). \n2 2 [1991] US Cong & Adm News 603-682. \n3 Section 1981 (Civil Rights Act of 1866) suits were an exception, as they did allow common law compensatory damages. \n4 42 USC s 1981a. \nPresently UK law forbids employment discrimination on the bases of gender, \nrace, national origin, ethnicity, colour, and disability.5 No UK law prohibits age or \nreligion (except in Northern Ireland) discrimination in employment, and sexual \norientation is not protected by UK law, as indeed it is not in the US. Damages can include \nawards for \u2018injury to feelings,\u2019 but no punitive or \u2018exemplary\u2019 damages; awards are not \ncapped, but are generally vastly smaller than those awarded in the US.6 Trials are not \nbefore juries, a fact that will receive greater attention in later sections. The substantive \nprotections, however, otherwise track with those provided under US law. \nOne distinction between US and UK application of these protections lies in the \nburden of proof for \u2018direct discrimination\u2019 (what the US calls \u2018disparate treatment\u2019). In \nthe US, making out a prima facie case, showing or implying that an employment decision \nwas discriminatory, shifts the burden of proof to the defendant to demonstrate a \nlegitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the decision or lose the case.7 If the defendant \nmeets this burden, the plaintiff can win by proving that the articulated reason is a \n\u2018pretext\u2019 for discrimination. This burden-shifting approach requires the application of a \ncarefully balanced, sometimes counter-intuitive evidentiary standard very much different \nfrom standards of basic industrial fairness or \u2018just cause,\u2019 which are commonly used by \nlabour arbitrators and employment tribunals. US courts have therefore erected an \nunabashedly legalistic substantive framework, which lends itself to complicated pretrial \nlegal arguments and jury instructions. In the UK, although the concept of the prima facie \ncase does apply, the making out of such a case without rebuttal allows, but does not \nrequire, the employment tribunal to infer discrimination.8 The tribunals retain a more \ncommon-sense approach, reserving for themselves the decision whether they believe \ndiscrimination occurred or not.   \nRecent circumstances have forced UK law to move closer to the US\u2019s more \nlegalistic approach. An important part of the employment law community in the UK \nviews the current approach as too informal, and inconsistent with the pro-plaintiff \nremedial aims of anti-discrimination law. Although recent reforms of employment \ntribunal procedure have responded to complaints that juridification has eroded the \noriginal \u2018easily accessible, informal, speedy, and inexpensive\u2019 character of the tribunals, \nparties to discrimination cases in particular are more likely to seek legal advice and insist \non strict application of substantive discrimination law.9  \nMore significantly, in 1997 the UK opted into the EC \u2018Social Chapter,\u2019 as a part \nof the Treaty of Amsterdam.10 On the heels of the UK opt-in, the EC has issued (among \nother measures) two directives addressing (1) race discrimination in employment and \nother contexts11 and (2) employment discrimination on the bases of religion, age, \n                                                 \n5 Equal Pay Act 1970 (\u2018EqPA\u2019); Sex Discrimination Act 1975 (\u2018SDA\u2019); Race Relations Act 1976 (\u2018RRA\u2019); Disability \nDiscrimination Act 1995 (\u2018DDA\u2019). \n6 See, eg, SDA \u00a7\u00a7 65-6; DDA \u00a7 8.  EqPA \u00a7 2(5) does effectively cap damages with a two year limitation on back-pay.  \n7 McDonnell Douglas Corp v Green 411 US 792, 802 (1973). \n8 B Heppel, M Cousey, & T Choudhury Equality: a New Framework (Hart Oxford 2000) pp 4.37-4.39 (\u2018Equality\u2019).  \n9 Equality (n 8 above) p 4.39; JK MacMillan \u2018Employment Tribunals: Philosophies and Practicalities\u2019 28 Ind L J 33, 34-40 \n(2000) (\u2018MacMillan\u2019); see also Anya v University of Oxford and Another [2001] IRLR 377 (the Court of Appeals admonished \nemployment tribunals to base decisions on detailed factual findings appropriate to the need of claimants to construct a \ncircumstantial discrimination case). \n10 Catherine Barnard EC Employment Law (OUP Oxford 2000) 1-20.   \n11 Council Directive 2000\/43\/EC of 29 June 2000, \u2018implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective \nof racial or ethnic origin\u2019 (\u2018Race Directive\u2019). \ndisability, ethnicity, and sexual orientation.12 These directives require that the UK adopt, \nby 2003, legislation protecting against specific grounds of discrimination. The \nEmployment Directive requires that the UK introduce new prohibitions relating to age, \nreligion, and sexual orientation. Another significant change heralded by both directives is \nthe requirement, in Article 8 of the Race Directive and Article 10 of the Employment \nDirective, that a court or \u2018other competent authority\u2019 deciding a discrimination case \nemploy a legalistic burden-shifting approach.13 Indeed, the 1997 EC Burden of Proof \nDirective (97\/80\/EC) already imposed this requirement for gender discrimination cases, \nleading to the Sex Discrimination (Indirect Discrimination and Burden of Proof) \nRegulations 2001. These regulations require tribunals to find for the claimant if a \ndefendant cannot disprove the prima facie case, and they formalize the legal concept of \nindirect discrimination (known in the US as disparate impact). Similar implementation of \nthe Race and Employment directives will ensure that the UK not only experiences an \nincreased caseload, but treats all forms of employment discrimination with a level of \nformality perhaps exceeding that of the US.14 \n3. THE US PROCEDURAL SYSTEM FOR EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION \nWhile substantive employment discrimination laws in the US and UK share basic \nfeatures and scope, the US and UK systems are not at all similar procedurally. The most \nthat can be said by way of similarity is that both systems are at base adversarial, although \neven that similarity can be misleading. The fundamental distinction lies between a system \nof specialized tribunals for employment cases and a system of federal courts with general \njurisdiction, that hear employment discrimination cases among a vast array of other \nunrelated matters. \nLong before they reach federal court, however, all US employment discrimination \ncases begin with a complaint to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission \n(\u2018EEOC\u2019); this is a mandatory prerequisite to a lawsuit, and is a different process \naltogether from the lawsuit itself.15 Any person who would complain formally of \nemployment discrimination must file a charge with the EEOC within 300 days of the \nalleged act.16 The EEOC then has exclusive jurisdiction of the claim for 180 days, during \nwhich time it purportedly investigates the claim. After this period the claimant can \nrequest that the EEOC cease its investigation, or can wait until the investigation bears \nfruit. If the claimant requests an end to the investigation, he will receive a \u2018right-to-sue\u2019 \nletter, certifying that he has exhausted the EEOC part of the process, and may proceed to \nfederal court.17 He has 90 days to do this.18   \n                                                 \n12 Council Directive 2000\/78\/EC of 12 October 2000, \u2018establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment \nand occupation\u2019 (\u2018Employment Directive\u2019). \n13 Equality (n 8 above) p 4.38.  \n14 It should be noted that the UK adopted the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law through the Human Rights \nAct 1998. This will surely affect employment discrimination protection, but its impact is too unclear for a meaningful analysis \nin this paper. See, eg, RW Rideout \u2018The Enforcement of Human Rights in Employment\u2019 52 Current Legal Problems (OUP \nOxford 1999) 239. \n15 42 USC s 2000e-5(e). \n16 The states generally have their own anti-discrimination laws and enforcement agencies. In recognition of this fact, the \noriginal 180-day limitation period for the federal statutes was extended to 300 days in those states that have their own \nrecognized investigative enforcement agency. In the few states where a putative plaintiff has only the EEOC, she must file \nwithin 180 days. An explanation of this eccentric system exceeds the scope of this article. \n17 See The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission An Evaluation of the EEOC Mediation Program (EEOC \nwww.eeoc.gov\/mediate\/report\/chapter4.html 1999) (\u2018EEOC Mediation\u2019). \n  According to the EEOC\u2019s own report on its procedures, leaving the charge with \nEEOC for investigation will yield one of three results: (1) a finding of no reasonable \ncause to believe discrimination has occurred; (2) a finding that reasonable cause exists, \nand conciliation should be pursued; or (3) a finding that reasonable cause exists, that \nconciliation should be pursued, and that, failing conciliation, the EEOC will take up the \nlawsuit itself.19 A finding of  \u2018no reasonable cause\u2019 means the claimant receives a right-\nto-sue letter, and may go to federal court. Only 8.8% of charges result in a finding of \nreasonable cause, of which one fourth (2.2% of total charges) successfully conciliate; of \nthe remaining 6.6%, only 0.35% become an EEOC lawsuit, and the rest receive a right-\nto-sue letter.20 Thus, in the neighbourhood of 97.45% of EEOC claimants either \nwithdraw their complaint or receive a right-to-sue letter. \n                                                                                                                                                \nTo understand why all employment discrimination claimants in the US must \nspend at least 180 days, and on average over 300 days,21 in an EEOC process which does \nlittle but delay the inevitable federal lawsuit in all but 2.55% of claims, requires an \nappreciation of the naivet\u00e9 of the legislators who created the EEOC in the 1960s, and of \nthe impact of the availability of punitive damages and a jury trial. Such an appreciation \ngoes beyond what this article can provide, but suffice it to say that in 1964 the US \nCongress thought that 180 days should be plenty of time for the EEOC to investigate and \nconciliate the vast majority of claims, and that federal lawsuits would be a last resort, and \ngenerally would be prosecuted by the EEOC, not the injured employee.22 Indeed, \nCongress hotly debated whether to give the EEOC quasi-judicial authority, in order to \nincrease access to remedies and speed resolution of disputes, but the majority consciously \ndecided to entrust the courts with the final say, limiting the EEOC\u2019s remedial power to \nthat of filing lawsuits on behalf of the aggrieved.23   \nThe EEOC has never received enough money to do this job, and since the 1960s \nthe legislature has (1) increased the time to file a charge, (2) assigned responsibility for \nall employment discrimination statutes (ADEA, ADA, EPA, Title VII) to the EEOC, and \n(3) added encouragements to litigation such as jury awards of punitive damages. This has \nleft the EEOC with a hopeless backlog for decades, and led the EEOC to divide charges \ninto three classes: (1) a tiny minority of high-profile cases targeted for litigation; (2) the \nlargest group of cases, considered weak, and left to languish until the 180 day period \nexpires; and (3) cases with some apparent merit, referred to mediation, and investigated \nonly where the mediation fails.24 For 97.45% of employment discrimination claimants, \nthis means a six-month to one-year delay and the right, after it all, to embark on a lawsuit \nin federal court. \n \n18 42 USC s 2000e-5(f)(1). \n19 EEOC Mediation (n 17 above). \n20 In 2000 EEOC received 79,896 charges of discrimination and filed 291 lawsuits.

For instance, the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh \nCircuit, the federal appeals court responsible for an area covering several states and \nincluding Chicago, Illinois, reported that in 1992 published appeals from employment \ndiscrimination cases were roughly half from trials and half from summary judgment; in \n1995 there were two summary judgment appeals for every one trial appeal, and by 1996 \nthere were four summary judgment appeals for every one from a trial. Whether it flows \nfrom the influence of jury trials, punitive damages, or some other source, summary \njudgment has become (1) an essential stage in almost all federal employment \ndiscrimination litigation, and (2) a focus for settlement efforts, either by negotiation, \nmediation, or some other means. \nPlaintiffs who successfully run the summary judgment gauntlet tend to win more \noften than defendants, and more often before juries than before judges (or arbitrators).31 \nThey usually receive high (by UK standards) punitive and compensatory damages from \njuries (a mean of $417,178 and a median of $106,500), usually with uncapped state \ndamages added on.32 Costs to litigants are frequently greater than $50,000 per party, and \n                                                 \n25 See RA Bales \u2018The Discord Between Collective Bargaining and Individual Employment Rights: Theoretical Origins and a \nProposed Reconciliation\u2019 77 Boston University L Rev 687 (1997). \n26 See D Sherwyn, JB Tracey, & ZJ Eigen \u2018In Defense of Mandatory Arbitration of Employment Disputes: Saving the  \nBaby, Tossing out the Bath Water, and Constructing a New Sink in the Process\u2019 2 U Pa J Lab & Emp L 73, 97-98 (1999) \n(\u2018Sherwin, Tracy, & Eigen\u2019); SB Burbank & LJ Silberman \u2018Civil Procedure Reform in Comparative Context: the United \nStates of America\u2019 45 AJCL 675 (1997) (\u2018Burbank & Silberman\u2019); HR Rep No 487, 105th Cong, 2nd Sess, 1998 (1998 WL \n191267); M Mankes \u2018Combating Individual Employment Discrimination in the United States and Great Britain: a Novel \nRemedial Approach\u2019 16 Comp Lab L J 67, 82-83 (1994) (\u2018Mankes\u2019). \n27 Fed R Civ P 26-37. \n28 Fed R Civ P 56.

THE UK PROCEDURAL SYSTEM FOR EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION \nComplaints of employment discrimination in the UK are made to the \u2018employment \ntribunals.\u2019 Until 1971 the tribunals, called \u2018industrial tribunals,\u2019 handled a small range of \nmatters such as entitlement to assessments from the Industrial Training Act 1964, or \npayments under the Redundancy Payments Act 1965.35 The Industrial Relations Act \n1971 introduced the cause of action for unfair dismissal, and gave jurisdiction of such \nclaims to the tribunals. In time the tribunals were given jurisdiction over equal pay \nclaims, sex discrimination claims, race discrimination claims, and now disability claims. \nThe decision to give essentially all individual (as opposed to collective) employment \nmatters to the tribunals drew in great part from the \u2018Donovan Report,\u2019 which hailed the \ntribunals, as it saw them in 1968, as \u2018easily accessible, informal, speedy, and \ninexpensive.\u201936 The tribunals consist of a Chairman,37 who is legally trained, and more \nspecifically trained to handle employment matters, and two lay members with som\n38ial experience.    \nThe tribunals were largely viewed as successful, although by the 1980s there were \ncomplaints that procedure before the tribunals had increased in formality and legalism.39 \nIn the mid-1990s complaints arose of backlogs in the London area tribunals (but not \nelsewhere) to the effect that \u2018only\u2019 54% of London cases were resolved at a tribunal \nhearing within 26 weeks of filing a claim.40 As a result, the Employment Tribunals Act \n1996, followed by the\nine the system. \nThe 1998 Act changed the name of the tribunals to \u2018employment\u2019 tribunals, \nprovided for new circumstances in which a Chairman can act without the lay members, \nand introduced measures to promote alternative means of dispute resolution.41 Presently, \na claim is filed on a form which a plaintiff can fill in by hand; this she must do within \nthree months for most forms of discrimination, two years for EqPA.42 The case is then \n \n33 Sherwin, Tracy, & Eigen (n 26 above) 81, 99-100; see also Burbank & Silberman (n 26 above); C Summers \u2018Remedies for \nEmployment Rights\u2019 141 U Pa L Rev 457, 486 (1991). \n34 A tall order given that she will either need to come up with tens of thousands of dollars or have a case good enough to \nconvince an attorney that, say, one third of the recovery after trial will exceed $40,000.

ACAS does not investigate as the EEOC is supposed to do, but immediately \nbegins a process of conciliation, which is a kind of shuttle diplomacy where the ACAS \nadvisor tries to avoid evaluating the parties\u2019 positions, but encourages compromise and \nconcess\nthat the\nS successfully conciliated 44%, 31% were withdrawn, \nand 25%\n                                                \nions, to the end of supervising a settlement.  \nThe UK does have investigative agencies, the Equal Opportunities Commission \n(EOC) for sex discrimination and the Commission on Racial Equality (CRE) for race \ndiscrimination, which can support claimants in litigating their claims, but claimants are \nnot required to go through these agencies, and they generally play a minor role in \nproviding remedies to individual employees.43 Instead, the agencies tend to focus on their \npowers to issue codes of practice, perform studies, and make recommendations or \nreports. They also have powers to make formal investigations and issue \n\u2018nondiscrimination orders,\u2019 but these do not relate to specific disputes, but to ongoing \nemployer practices, and carry no award of damages. Whether the activities of the EOC \nand CRE more effectively combat employment discrimination than do awards of \ndamages to aggrieved employees falls outside the ambit of this comparison, but it is clear \ny do not affect the dispute resolution process to the extent of the EEOC or ACAS. \nIf a case does not settle through ACAS conciliation, many interlocutory matters \ncan come before a chairman alone, and the parties may (although this is rarely done) \nsubmit their case for a resolution without a hearing. Cases are tried on fairly basic \ndiscovery, and the tribunal conducts an informal hearing by US federal court standards, \nsometimes playing an inquisitorial role where parties are unrepresented, in an otherwise \nadversarial procedure.44 It is too early to measure the effects of the 1998 Act, but even at \nthe time it came into effect, outside of London some 85% of cases resolved by a tribunal \nhearing were finished within 26 weeks;45 the average award of damages in 2000-2001 \nwas \u20a411,024 for sex discrimination, \u20a412,978 for disability discrimination, and \u20a415,484 \nfor race discrimination.46 The average cost to each litigant is less than 1000 pounds, \nborne by each party.47 In the fifteen month period from 1 April 1999 to 30 June 2000, the \ntribunals and ACAS received 17,329 employment discrimination cases (including equal \npay); of all of these cases, ACA\n went to the tribunals.48 \nThe process for resolving EqPA cases contrasts with this rosy picture of speedy \nremedies. UK protection against unequal pay for work of \u2018equal value\u2019 (like \u2018comparable \nworth\u2019 in the US) generally involves referral to an independent expert.49 The independent \nexpert provides an opinion, on which the tribunal relies, as to whether the claimant\u2019s job \ncarries equal value to that of the chosen comparators. This process of course takes time. \n \n43 See Equality (n 8 above) p 4.35; NR Lipper \u2018Sexual Harassment in the Workplace: a Comparative Study of Great Britain \nand the United States\u2019 13 Comp Lab L J 293 (1992); M MacEwan \u2018Promoting Equal Opportunity: the Role of the Regulatory \nAgency in Racial Discrimination\u2019 1 Int\u2019l J of Disc & L 39 (1995). \n44 Employment Tribunals (n 35 above) ch 3; Mankes (n 26 above) 92-93; MacMillan (n 9 above) 37-44. \n45 MacMillan (n 9 above) 45-46; Employment Tribunals (n 35 above) p 1.1.4 (\u2018The author\u2019s experience suggests that, outside \nLondon, cases are coming on so quickly for trial that many legal representatives are unprepared for trial\u2019). \n46 Employment Tribunals Service Annual Report for year ending 31 March 2001 . \n47 MacMillan (n 9 above); 47; ACAS Annual Report, 1999-2000 (ACAS Leicester 2000) (\u2018ACAS\u2019).

In the UK a claimant (except in an EqPA case) \ncan realistically expect to present her case to an expert tribunal within six months of \nfiling her claim (which must happen within three months of the alleged grievance) and, if \nshe prevails, collect a modest, four-figure award. US claimants struggle through the \nsystem for a time UK tribunals would call \u2018scandalous\u2019 and a \u2018denial of justice,\u2019 probably \nfollowed by abject defeat on summary judgment, but possibly leading, after three years of \nprocess, to $300,000 in pain and suffering, $300,000 in punitive dam\nunspecified state damages, making a major public statement into the bargain. \n5. ADR IN THE RESOLUTION OF EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION CASES \nAgainst the backdrop of the systems described above, Parliament has introduced the \nEmployment Rights (Dispute Resolution) Act 1998 in the UK, and Congress enacted the \nAlternative Dispute Resolution Act of 1998 in the US. Although the timing and names of \nthe acts suggest an eerie coincidence, the statutes do very different things, and enter onto \nADR landscapes which have developed along distinct lines. For example, while ADR is \nused in the UK in international business settings, to resolve construction disputes and, \nless commonly, in collective labour disputes,53 arbitration54 and mediation play almost \nno role whatsoever in\ne \u2018alternative.\u2019   \nContrast this with the US, where the area of employment discrimination has seen \nincreased use of mediation and negotiation, and the proliferation of pre-dispute \narbitration agreements, often entered into as part of the consideration for employment.55 \nSome courts have actually employed court-annexed arbitration, although this is rare; most \ncourts use court-ordered mediation, or aggressive, settlement-oriented case \nmanagement.56 The EEOC tries to refer half of its charges to mediation under its in-house \n                                                 \n50 88 Equal Opportunities Review 16 (1999). \n51 Aldridge v British Telecommunications, plc [1990] IRLR 10, 14. \nent Tribunals (n 35 above) p 4.5.1; N Speechly \u2018Talkin\u2019 \u2018Bout a Resolution\u2019 67 The In-\n I will treat it as an \n000) \nloyment\/protocol.html\n52 Equality (n 8 above) p 4.31. \n53 See ACAS (n 47 above); Employm\nHouse Lawyer 16 (February 1999). \n54 Although some insist that arbitration falls outside the rubric of ADR owing to its adjudicative character,\nADR technique in light of its role as an alternative to the formal procedural mechanisms. \n55 See EEOC Mediation (n 17 above); Stone (n 31 above); SA Fitzgibbon \u2018After Gardner-Denver, Gilmer, and Wright: the \nSupreme Court\u2019s Next Arbitration Decision\u2019 44 St. Louis U L J 833 (2000) (\u2018Fitzgibbon\u2019); J Waters \u2018Does the Battle Over \nMandatory Arbitration Jeopardize the EEOC\u2019s War  in Fighting Workplace Discrimination?\u2019 44 St. Louis U L J 1155 (2\n(\u2018Waters\u2019); TC Bailey \u2018Reconciling Alexander and Gilmer: Explaining the Continued Vitality of Alexander v.

This writer has litigated cases which involved (1) \nthrough (5).  This gives one the impression, as an academic and as an advocate who has \nrepresented employers and employees in US employment discrimination matters, that \nparticipants in the US system\u2015parties, their attorneys, and the courts\u2015are desperate for \nsome w\n forms according to the aims of \nrced to require that an employee submit \ndiscrim 59\n                                                \nay out of the time, expense, and frustration of the formal system. \nThe next three sections will look in turn at pre-dispute arbitration agreements in \nthe US, post-dispute ADR in the US, and ADR use in the UK. The kinds of ADR thet \nfeature primarily in these sections are arbitration, mediation and conciliation. Although \nthese techniques find expression in various forms, the following discussion will benefit \nfrom a general typology. Arbitration refers to the submission of a dispute, usually under a \ncontract between the parties, to an independent, private person (or panel of persons) for \nadjudication. The arbitrator (or arbitrators) is usually experienced in the field from which \nthe dispute arises, and often has legal training. Arbitration is almost always binding on \nthe parties, but this depends on the contract under which the dispute is submitted to \narbitration, as do the process and standards for selecting the arbitrator or panel.  \nMediation involves an agreement by the parties to employ a third person, also usually \nlegally trained and having some experience with the class of case to be mediated, to assist \nin the negotiation of a settlement. The mediator often gives the parties an opportunity to \nstate their case to each other, before separating them and engaging in a process of \nconveying proposals between the parties whilst helping to educate them about the \nstrengths and weaknesses of their cases.  Finally, conciliation is essentially mediation \nperformed by an official intermediary, and takes different\nthe officials (for these purposes, the EEOC and ACAS).   \n6. PRE-DISPUTE ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS IN THE US \nPotential defendants in the US sometimes choose ADR even before a dispute arises, \nusing pre-dispute mandatory arbitration agreements (\u2018PMAAs\u2019). These are contracts, \ngenerally at the inception of a relationship (either an employment, collective bargaining, \nor a licensing relationship), and often in consideration for employment, which require the \nsubmission to binding arbitration of all disputes arising out of the relationship.58 US \ncourts have held that such agreements can be enfo\nination claims to binding arbitration.      \nThe arbitration required by PMAAs generally involves a single arbitrator (some \ncall for three), selected according to a procedure set out in the arbitration agreement. \n \nration for Discrimination Claims\u2019 31 \n \n \n992); Cook v Barratt \n57 EEOC Mediation (n 17 above). \n58 MZ Green \u2018Debunking the Myth of Employer Advantage From Using Mandatory Arbit\nRutgers L J 399, 400-421 (2000) (\u2018Green\u2019); Bompey & Pappas (n 31 above) 198-201.  \n59Gilmer v. Interstate\/Johnston Lane 500 US 20 (1991) (\u2018Gilmer\u2019). The decision addressed a licensing, not an employment,\ncontract and explicitly avoided the question of whether the Federal Arbitration Act (9 USC s 1) allows the enforcement of \nPMAAs in employment agreements. However, lower appellate courts have enforced PMAAs in employment contracts, and the\nSupreme Court has not intervened. See, eg, Mago v Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc 956 F2d 932 (9th Cir 1\nAm, Inc 219 Cal App 3d 1004, 268 Cal Rptr 629 (4th App Dist 1990) cert denied 111 SCt 2052 (1991). \nDiscovery is informal, although arbitrators generally have subpoena authority.60 The \nhearing can take place within a month or two of submission, takes a day on average (but \ncan take two or three), and is often followed by the submission of written briefs within a \nmonth of the hearing. A decision, usually based on a written opinion, should issue within \na month. The entire process can take less than six months (264 days has been quoted as \nan average), and costs less than court litigation, especially where a party proceeds \nwithout counsel.61 Arbitration is generally considered final, and not subject to meaningful \njudicial\nyee-side PMAA supporters also explain that arbitration can \nincorpo\nbstantive standards.  The courts presently forbid an arbitration agreement or \naward t\n review under the Federal Arbitration Act, except for fraud, drunkenness, or \nexceeding authority under the arbitration agreement.62   \nThe proponents of enforcing PMAAs, often strange bedfellows, focus on the need \nfor quick, cheap, quiet, and, overall, accessible resolution. Supporters from the \nemployee\/plaintiff camp point to the fact that the formal process (lengthy EEOC, lengthy \nfederal process, prohibitive expense) provides no real forum at all.63 They claim the \nappropriate comparison is not between arbitration and a big, happy federal trial with a \ngullible jury and lots of judicially enforced procedural protections, but between \narbitration and never finding a lawyer to take the case, or getting squashed on summary \njudgment, or languishing in the system until accepting a nuisance settlement seems the \nonly way out.64 The emplo\nrate sensitivity to the unique issues arising in an industrial setting better than any \ngeneralist federal judge.65   \nTheir fellow travellers, the employers, claim that while arbitration may afford \nevery plaintiff a forum, and might mean more individual awards, the awards will not \napproach the numbers federal juries give, attorney\u2019s fees will be kept low, and the cases \nwill stay out of the papers.66 Both employer and employee-side supporters agree, \nhowever, that arbitration must provide whichever procedural safeguards are most \nimportant to that party.67 Several organizations and academics, sympathetic to the rights \nof aggrieved employees to the processes intended by the various statutes, object to \nenforcement of PMAAs unless they comply with an agreed \u2018Due Process Protocol,\u2019 \nwhich guarantees several court-like procedural protections, and the application of \nstatutory su 68\no divest them of jurisdiction unless statutory remedies and minimal procedures are \nassured.69 \nOn the other side of the debate are the EEOC and another faction sympathetic to \nemployees. They are concerned that compulsory arbitration deprives the EEOC of its \n                                                 \n60 H Brown & A Marriot ADR Principles and Practice (Sweet & Maxwell London 1999) ch 1 (\u2018ADR Principles\u2019) 77-78. \n above) 99-100; ADR Principles (n 60 above) 77-78. \n; Waters (n 55 above). \nl (n 55 above); Green (n 58 above); Fitzgibbon (n 55 above). \n61 Sherwin, Tracy, & Eigen (n 26\n62 9 USC s 10. \n63 Fitzgibbon (n 55 above); Mankes (n 26 above); Green (n 58 above). \n64 See Sherwin, Tracy, & Eigen (n 26 above). \n65 Fitzgibbon (n 55 above). \n66 Green (n 58 above)\n67 See, eg, Due Process Protoco\n68 See Due Process Protocol (n 55 above); National Academy of Arbitrators \u2018Guidelines on Arbitration of Statutory Claims \nunder Employer-Promulgated Systems\u2019 (www.naarb.org\/guidelines.html 1997); Fitzgibbon (n 55 above); Bailey (n 55 abo\nGreen (n 58 above). \n69 Gilmer (n 59 above) 30-32. \nve); \nopportunity to punish the bad guys and strike a blow for change.70 The argument is that \nthe whole point of the statutes, and of the fact that they require resort to an enforcement \nagency like the EEOC, federal lawsuits, juries, punitive damages, and attorney\u2019s fees for \nsuccessful plaintiffs, is to allow first the EEOC, and then certain particularly aggrieved \ncitizens, to make a statement, and discourage discriminatory conduct nationwide.71 \nAccording to this theory, arbitration cannot possibly accomplish what Congress intended, \nployers money, and it does provide access even \n \nprogram\ng dissatisfied parties can bring an arbitrated case back to court for \na new t\narguments for the \ndefenda\nfor the very reasons that it does save em\nto small claims. \n7. POST-DISPUTE ADR IN THE US \nWhile some participants like the idea of substituting arbitration for litigation before a \ndispute arises, very seldom, if at all, do parties opt to arbitrate an employment \ndiscrimination claim after the initiation of a lawsuit or EEOC charge.72 Indeed, \narbitration seems to have few supporters once the system has been set in motion. For \nexample, the EEOC has recently instituted a mediation program, but not an arbitration\n. The Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 1998 (ADRA) provides for \ncompulsory mediation, but not arbitration.73 Why is arbitration a good idea before a \ndispute arises, but not after? \nThe answer, of course, depends upon which participant you ask. Courts appear to \nbe warming to arbitration, and will enforce PMAAs which meet certain criteria. This, like \nthe rising stock of summary judgment, may relate to increased pressure to clear \novercrowded court caseloads. Congress, as evidenced by the ADRA, appears unwilling to \nthrust arbitration on parties not bound by a PMAA. ADRA now requires all federal courts \nto institute some kind of court-annexed ADR, including non-binding arbitration, \nmediation, early neutral evaluation, and summary jury trials (many have been doing so \nsince 1990). However, binding arbitration does not feature in ADRA or any federal court \nADR program, meanin\nrial.74 Leaving arbitration non-binding reflects Congress\u2019s hesitance to undermine \nthe remedial objectives of the statutes, and preference for leaving people to choose \nwhether to arbitrate.   \nEmployers generally choose not to. They have a stake in the full US process: \ndelay, the EEOC-court-appeal hierarchy, and the expense of full-blown litigation all work \nto pressure the plaintiff into a smaller settlement.75 Summary judgment is the employer\u2019s \nfriend, allowing him to impose an expensive discovery and summary judgment defence \nworkload on the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys, and out-lawyer the other side before her story has a \nchance emotionally to affect a fact-finder. Arbitrators are known to give \u2018compromise\u2019 \nawards, sympathizing with the plaintiff despite compelling legal \nnt.76 Moreover, statistics demonstrate that arbitrators are more plaintiff-friendly \n                                                 \n70 See Stone (n 31 above) 1036-43; Waters (n 55 above) 1171-4.  It is interesting that the EEOC seems satisfied as long as it \ngets to decide which cases must be large and public, and which cases get cleared off the decks through EEOC-sponsored \nmediation.

Evidently not. Arbitrators, while finding for plaintiffs more often than \njudges, seldom award punitive damages and generally award smaller amounts, and find \nfor defendants more often, than juries.78 The average plaintiff must find an attorney to \ntake a case on a contingent fee or \u2018no-win no-pay\u2019 basis. Modest awards do not make for \nhealthy contingent fees.79 Discrimination is hard to prove: attorneys must eschew cases \nwhere if they win, they will only receive the market value for their time. Therefore, even \nthe red\nt to a choice for arbitration, but they are chosen from a state \nof igno\nchosen\n benefits of mediation spill beyond the reach of this piece, but some of those \nbenefits ex\nContin\npoint: \nsolve the claim. \u2026 If it is a case with a real liability exposure, \npre\nent before suit at a fraction of the cost of \nlitig\n                                                \nuced costs of arbitration must be balanced against the need to get a large award to \ncover fees. A plaintiff proceeding without an attorney would almost certainly benefit \nfrom an arbitral alternative, but if the plaintiff proposes arbitration, what employer would \nagree, and pass up a chance to out-lawyer an unrepresented claimant?    \nWhen parties have a case in front of them, and compare the tools they have to get \ntheir way in federal court to the tools afforded by arbitration, at least one of them rejects \narbitration.80 PMAAs amoun\nrance about the strength or weakness of the potential case. Once people actually \nknow what they have, the siren songs of punitive damages (in a strong case) or of \nopportunities for delay and pressure (in a weak case) seem to blot the benefits of \narbitration from the mind.   \nMediation, on the other hand, is clearly the ADR darling of US employment \ndiscrimination law. The EEOC, representing the interests of aggrieved employees, has \n mediation over arbitration.81 Federal court-annexed mediation schemes almost \nalways ear-mark employment discrimination cases as \u2018appropriate for mediation.\u201982 The \nmyriad\nplain why it plays such a large role in US employment discrimination disputes. \nThe following excerpt, from a paper presented at an American Bar Association \nuing Legal Education Seminar on mediation in employment law, illustrates the \nGiven the cost of litigating even a \u2018winning\u2019 case \u2026 consideration should be \ngiven in every [discrimination] claim whether a pre-litigation mediation may be \nthe best way to re\n-litigation mediation makes sense if for no other reason than to avoid the costs \nof defense and, in discrimination cases, plaintiff\u2019s counsel.

If discovery has gone well and a \nplausible summary judgment threat can be made, plaintiff may be motivated to \nsettle at a figure appealing to the defense to avoid the risk of summary \njudgment.83 \n \nAlthough the foregoing expresses the strategic considerations of an employer\u2019s counsel, it \ndemonstrates the kind of attitude that attorneys on both sides take to mediation. They see \nit as a flexible, tactical tool, ready for use when the tide of battle dictates. Some counsel \nuse it simply to educate clients about weaknesses in the case, or to learn about the \nopponent\u2019s evidence and approach.84 \nMediation in the US employment discrimination field generally involves what the \nUK would call evaluative, facilitative mediation. Unlike ACAS conciliation, which \nremains neutral and simply helps the parties understand each other\u2019s positions, a US \nmediator provides a sense of a forum for expressing grievances, as well as evaluating the \nstrengths and weaknesses of the parties\u2019 cases. Unlike EEOC conciliation, which assumes \nasonable cause\u2019 has been found and advocates a specific settlement, a mediator \nattempts to effectuate the wishes of the parties, while telling them what is realistic, and \nperhaps making recommendations for what concessions would yield counter-\nconcessions.85 The mediation takes place in person (both ACAS and EEOC conciliation \noften take place over the phone),86 and each party makes a statement, followed by the \nparties retiring to separate rooms, and the mediator essentially shuttling between the two.   \nThe most attractive attribute of mediation is its non-binding nature.87 The parties \ncan get the things the scholars tell us they would get from arbitration: quick and easy \naccess to a forum, a resolution without excessive delay and expense\nres. If they do not like where the mediation takes them, they can withdraw and \nproceed with formal litigation. Of course, the obvious downsides to mediation include \nresolutions which compromise what some consider categorical principles and, in many \ncases, no resolution at all.  After months or years of draining process, however, claimants \nwho began intending to vindicate their rights appear willing to accept five or six figures \nin exchange for letting their employer avoid any finding of wrongdoing.  \nThus US litigants demonstrate their frustration with how the formal system works \nby reaching for mediation and similar techniques (judge-assisted negotiations, early \n \n83 J Parton (III) & J Lau \u2018Making a Settlement Stick\u2019 ABA CLE Seminar Documents, San Francisco, October 9, 1998, 585, \n587-9 (\u2018Parton & Lau\u2019). \n84 Rudy & Guerin (n 82 above); Parton & Lau (n 83 above). \n85 ADR Principles (n 60 above) 277-293. \n86 ADR Principles (n 60 above) 77-78, 273-280. \n87 See Rudy & Guerin (n 82 above). \nneutral evaluation), but they will not reach all the way and opt for binding arbitration \n \n \nb ACAS, or made privately with assistance from a \u2018relevant independent \nadvisor\nations resulting in either settlement or withdrawal of complaints.94 It has \nbeen s\nthe 1998 Act introduced a new arbitration alternative for non-collective disputes.

In the end, a \nsystem which does not give participants what they want remains intact, but festooned \nwith \u2018alternatives,\u2019 which are simply ways out of the nightmare that is US civil litigation. \n \n8. UK USE OF ADR TO RESOLVE EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION CASES \nThe employment discrimination system in the UK has seen almost no use of pre-dispute \narbitration agreements, and much less resort to mediation.88 Arbitration has seldom been \nused because the race, sex, and now disability statutes have forbidden any arbitration \nagreement from divesting the employment tribunals of jurisdiction.89 In fact, no \nagreement may effect a prior waiver of employment discrimination protections, and once \na claimant invokes the jurisdiction of the tribunals, no agreement, except one brokered \nand approved y \n,\u2019 can oust the tribunals of jurisdiction.90 Prior to the recent arbitral alternative for \nunfair dismissal cases, ACAS had no authority to settle individual cases through \narbitration. Thus the only experience most employers and employees have of arbitration \ncomes from an arbitration service that ACAS has offered on a voluntary, non-binding \nbasis, and used almost exclusively for collective disputes, or for individual claims in a \nunion setting.91   \nMediation is a word seldom seen in UK employment discrimination literature, \nprobably owing to the fact that ACAS conciliation, which is much like simple facilitative \nmediation, has completely occupied the field. US-style mediation has been urged,92 but \nnot stridently, as this would involve paying extra to a neutral to do what ACAS does on \npublic funds, except with a greater degree of case evaluation by the neutral. When ACAS \nreceives a case, it opens negotiations between the parties and works for a settlement \nwhile adhering to a strict principle of neutrality.93 ACAS has a high success rate, with \n75% of concili\nuggested that this success rate owes something to the fact that access to the \nemployment tribunals is geographically difficult, and claimants accept settlements or \nwithdraw complaints to avoid travel.  It should be noted that this factor applies equally to \nUS federal courts and EEOC offices, which are often hundreds of miles apart.  Whatever \nthe reasons, UK litigants do not clamour for mediation-style alternatives to ACAS \nconciliation.   \nIn addition to changes aimed at streamlining the actual process of the Tribunals, \nbecause the new option arose in response to\n                                                 \n88 ADR Principles (n 60 above) 273-280. \n89 Employment Rights Act 1996 s 203; Employment Tribunals (n 35 above) p 5.2.7. \n also offers \u2018advisory mediation\u2019 in connection with collective disputes. \n90 Employment Tribunals (n 35 above) p 5.2.11. \n91 ACAS (n 47 above) app 1-3.

The Act provided for prompt \nimplementation of an ACAS-contrived scheme for arbitration of unfair dismissal \ncomplaints, and allowed for a subsequent order, by a secretary of state, that ACAS \nprepare a program of arbitration for claims like employment discrimination.   \nThis has not occurred as yet, and according to ACAS will not occur in the near \nfuture.97 Arbitration is not an option which the UK is necessarily free to employ, because \nsoon all UK employment discrimination law will be backed-up by EC law, which can \nlimit the UK\u2019s freedom to improvise remedies.  For example, in 1988 a UK tribunal held \nthat EC law prohibited the imposition of an upper limit on sex discrimination damages \n(no longer in effect in the UK), in that it failed to deliver the deterrent effect \ncontemplated by EC discrimination protections.98 EC directives already dictate burdens \nof proof, and could go beyond that to dictate procedure. At present the concern is that the \nan informal arbitral alternative could\nice as inconsistent with enforcement of the substantive rights guaranteed by the \nRace Directive and Employment Directive. Any alternative will probably require \nsomething like an American-style arbitration, taking six months and costing as much as, \nor more than, a tribunal proceeding. \nParticipants in the UK system appear to want change, pointing specifically to \nexcessive legal formality and, surprisingly from a US perspective, delay and expense. \nHowever, there is little evidence that delay remains a persistent problem except in EqPA \nclaims, and no time would be saved by an arbitration scheme that \nocess Protocol. Arbitration could only save money if it reduced legalism and \nformality to the point that lawyers, discovery, and other expensive parts of the process \ndisappeared. This seems unlikely to suit any party to a discrimination claim, and \nsolicitors who practise in the field say they would not advise it.99 \nA recent poll of employers found that only half would likely use the new ACAS \narbitration scheme, because they hoped it would take less time and be cheaper.100 But the \nentire article in which the survey appeared, an IRS Employment Trends special feature on \nnew ADR developments, made no mention of arbitration for discrimination claims. The \nConfederation of British Industry makes it very clear, in a statement from its Human \nResources Directorate to its members, that it favours the new scheme \u2018for the cases most \n \n7 (www.parliament.the-stationery-95 Lords Hansard Text for 25 July 1997 and 21 October 199\noffice.co.uk\/pa\/ld199697\/ldhansard.html); Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service \u2018ACAS Arbitration Scheme for the \nResolution of Unfair Dismissal Disputes\u2019 (ACAS 1998); MacMillan (n 9 above) 38-9. \n96 See Equality (n 8 above); MacMillan (n 9 above) 37-41. \n97 See, eg, Race Directive (n 11 above); Employment Directive (n 12 above); Employment Tribunals (n 35 above) p 5.3.21.

CONCLUSION \nAlthough dissatisfaction with the existing formal procedure drives calls for ADR in both \nthe US and the UK, complaints are more strident in the US, and areas of concern in each \nsystem differ. The popularity of ADR in the US stems from frustration with the official \nsystem, making alternatives o\ns not immune to US-sized delays and costs, but these problems are not evident in \nthe system for protecting against employment discrimination. The difference might result \nfrom the fact that the US consciously turned away from providing an easy forum for \nresolution, and chose to use the dispute resolution process as its mechanism for fighting \nemployment discrimination.   \nThe UK decided, in enacting the SDA and then the RRA, to fight discrimination \nby (1) setting up agencies whose remit was to promote equal employment opportunities \n) creating a wholly separate means for providing remedies to wronged \nindividuals.104 It is generally accepted that the remedies afforded by the tribunal system \naim at compensation, not deterrence.105 Although another paper might address whether \nthe EOC and the CRE effectively promote equal employment opportunity in the UK, it is \nclear that the tribunals and ACAS have generally provided accessible, cheap resolutions.   \nThe US, on the other hand, opted to combine the EEOC\u2019s discrimination-fighting \ntask with the resolution of individual disputes.106 It was assumed at the time that this \nwould be consistent with individual access to justice, but access was not a separate \npriority. When this assumption proved na\u00efve, in that most employees went without a real \nremedy while the EEOC and a few well-represented private attorneys-general struck \nblows for equality, the Civil Rights Act of 1991 appears to have confirmed the emphasis \n                                                 \n101 CBI Human Resources Directorate \u2018Managing a Compensation Culture: Improving Case Management in the Employment \nTribunal System\u2019 (CBI 2000) p 18. \ng, PR Ghandhi & PG Schofield \u2018Damages for Employment Discrimination\u2019 140 (No 6439) New Law Journal 52 \n55, 2515-6. \n102 Equality (n 8 above) 119. \n103 Equality (n 8 above) pp 4.32, 4.65. \n104 See, eg, White Paper Racial Discrimination (HMSO London 1975) pp 40-41. \n105 See, e\n(1990). \n106 2 [1964] US Cong & Adm News 2411, 24\non proc\nmost interesting product of this \ncomparison.
