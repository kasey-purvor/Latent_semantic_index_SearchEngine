We have mapped \nthe distribution and quantified the solid grain volume of four unconformity-bound \nsuccessions in the region: the Eocene (~6\u20138 \u00d7 104 km3), Oligocene (~2 \u00d7 104 km3), \nMiocene\u2212Lower Pliocene (~4\u20135 \u00d7 104 km3) and Lower Pliocene\u2212Holocene (~4\u20135 \u00d7 104 km3) \ncomplementing previous work on the Paleocene succession.

The \nCenozoic uplift and deformation of the British Isles and the adjacent Atlantic Margin is an \nexample that has been well studied both onshore and offshore using data largely acquired in \nthe search for hydrocarbons. We previously analyzed the exhumation history of the British \nIsles using Apatite Fission Track Analysis (AFTA) and other quantitative techniques, \nconcluding that there were several episodes of Cenozoic exhumation (Paleocene, Eocene\u2013\nOligocene and Miocene; Hillis et al., 2008; Holford et al., 2009). We argued that the \ndistribution and chronology of Cenozoic exhumation are not consistent with a dominant \ncontrol by Paleocene uplift induced by the Iceland plume, as has been proposed (White and \nLovell, 1997; Jones et al., 2002), and that episodic intraplate compression, driven by plate \nboundary forces was the principal cause of uplift responsible for the observed multiple phases \nof exhumation (Holford et al., 2009).  \nThe Cenozoic sedimentary rocks in the basins surrounding the British Isles, with \nparticular focus on the Paleocene, have been interpreted as the erosional products of source \nareas uplifted due to the Iceland plume, and sedimentary patterns have been taken as a \npotentially sensitive measure of plume activity (White and Lovell, 1997; Jones et al., 2002). \nHere we present new two-way travel-time (TWTT) thickness maps and estimates of the solid \ngrain sediment volume for four distinct, unconformity-bounded, post-breakup Cenozoic \nsedimentary successions within the Rockall and Faroe-Shetland Basins off NW Britain: the \nEocene, Oligocene, Miocene\u2013Lower Pliocene, and Lower Pliocene\u2013Holocene (Fig. 1). \nApproximately 80% of the total Cenozoic sediment volume on the Atlantic margin off NW \nBritain was deposited in Eocene and later times, hence Paleocene plume-related uplift was \nnot a dominant control on Cenozoic sedimentation in the area. Rather, the ages of the mapped \nPage 2 of 2 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n66 \n67 \n68 \n69 \n70 \n71 \n72 \n73 \n74 \nsuccessions correlate closely with recognized episodes of uplift in the British Isles during the \nEocene\u2013Oligocene and Miocene (Holford et al., 2009) and also in the Pliocene\u2013 Pleistocene \n(e.g., Maddy, 1997; Watts et al., 2005). In this paper, we describe the post-breakup Cenozoic \nsedimentary successions within the northern Rockall and Faroe-Shetland basins and discuss \ntheir implications for Cenozoic uplift of the British Isles and its continental shelf. \nCENOZOIC POST-RIFT SEDIMENT DISTRIBUTION OFF NW BRITAIN \nOur maps are based on four decades of seismic acquisition and borehole drilling by \nthe British Geological Survey as part of its mapping of the UK continental margin, \nsupplemented by additional industry and non-industry data as part of the EC-funded \nSTRATAGEM project (further details of data used and mapping methodology are provided \nin Appendix DR11). These data reveal multiple sediment sources to the deep-water basins \nthroughout the Cenozoic, and suggest that sedimentation has not declined in any systematic \nmanner since breakup. This stepwise pattern of sedimentation is incompatible with the notion \nthat the Cenozoic succession is dominated by erosional detritus from sediment source areas \nuplifted in the Paleocene by the Iceland plume (e.g., Jones et al., 2002). \nSedimentation in both the Rockall and Faroe-Shetland basins continued in several \npulses throughout the Eocene, as reflected by the deposition of a series of progradational \nshelf-margin to basinal sequences derived from the Hebrides and West Shetland shelves, the \nFaroe Shelf, and the Rockall Plateau (Andersen et al., 2002; Praeg et al., 2005; McInroy et \nal., 2006; Fig. 2A). Our maps also show focused intrabasinal sedimentation during the \nOligocene, particularly in the northeast Rockall Basin, and in the Faroe-Shetland Basin \nduring the Miocene\u2013Early Pliocene (Egerton, 1998; Elliott et al., 2006). This reflects the \ncontemporary response of sedimentation to compressional tectonics during these times \n(Stoker et al., 2005; Figure 2B\u2212C). Although axially-transported deposition from deep-water \nbottom currents was instigated in the Late Eocene, as reflected in the sedimentary \nPage 3 of 3 \n75 \n76 \n77 \n78 \n79 \n80 \n81 \n82 \n83 \n84 \n85 \n86 \n87 \n88 \n89 \n90 \n91 \n92 \n93 \n94 \n95 \n96 \n97 \n98 \n99 \narchitecture of the Oligocene and younger basinal deposits (Fig. 1), much of this material was \nderived from contemporary erosion of the adjacent continental margin (Laberg et al., 2005). \nThe Early Pliocene\u2013Pleistocene interval witnessed significant (50\u2212100 km) expansion of the \nshelf-margin off NW Britain and the Faroe Islands, as sedimentation became focused in a \nnumber of discrete prograding sediment wedges (Figs. 1 and 2D). Climate change and \nglaciation are known to have made a major contribution to the sediment budget during this \ninterval. However, the onset of prograding wedge development on the NW British margin \nwas linked to large-amplitude seaward tilting of the margin , which occurred up to 1 My prior \nto mid-latitude glaciation (Stoker, 2002; Praeg et al., 2005). \nWe estimated solid grain sediment volumes by converting our TWTT maps into \ndepth-maps, using representative end-member velocities for the Cenozoic succession of 1.5 \nand 2.0 km s-1, and then subtracted the pore-space volume as predicted by a standard \nporosity-depth relationship (Appendix DR2). Our results indicate that the northern Rockall \nBasin and the Faroe-Shetland Basin contain volumes of ~57,500\u201376,800 km3 for the Eocene \nsuccession, ~16,300\u201322,500 km3 for the Oligocene succession, ~35,100\u201348,800 km3 for the \nMiocene\u2013Lower Pliocene succession and 37,900\u201352,100 km3 for the Lower Pliocene\u2013\nHolocene succession. The volume of Eocene sediment compares well with previous estimates \nfor the Faroe Shetland Basin alone (~48,000 km3: Smallwood, 2008) and is larger than the \nvolume of Eocene sediment in the northern North Sea Basin (~51,598 km3: Liu and \nGalloway, 1997). It is also larger than the volume of Paleocene sediment in the Faroe-\nShetland Basin (~35\u201355,000 km3: Smallwood, 2005) and is significantly higher than \nestimates of the Paleocene solid sediment volume in the northern North Sea Basin (i.e., \n26,000 km3: White and Lovell, 1997; 36,301 km3: Liu and Galloway, 1997). Our analysis \nindicates a reduction in sediment input to the Rockall and Faroe-Shetland Basins during the \nOligocene in comparison to the Eocene, but our volumetric estimate for the Miocene\u2013Lower \nPage 4 of 4 \n100 \n101 \n102 \n103 \n104 \n105 \n106 \n107 \n108 \n109 \n110 \n111 \n112 \n113 \n114 \n115 \n116 \n117 \n118 \n119 \n120 \n121 \n122 \n123 \n124 \nPliocene succession is comparable to the volumes of Paleocene and Eocene sediment \nestimated for the Faroe-Shetland Basin by Smallwood (2008). Perhaps the most surprising \naspect of our results is the volume of the Lower Pliocene\u2013Holocene succession, given the \ncomparatively short time interval (~5 My) this succession represents. Its volume is \ncomparable to the Paleocene succession of the Faroe-Shetland Basin and is considerably \nlarger than the volume of Paleocene sediment in the northern North Sea. Our results thus lend \nlittle support to the notion that the acme of Cenozoic sedimentation around the British Isles \noccurred during the Paleocene, as the Paleocene succession constitutes only ~20% of the total \nCenozoic solid grain sediment volume off NW Britain. \nCORRELATION WITH THE UPLIFT HISTORY OF THE BRITISH ISLES AND \nIMPLICATIONS FOR POST-BREAKUP TECTONIC HISTORY OF THE \nATLANTIC MARGIN \nEocene, Oligocene, Miocene\u2013Early Pliocene and Early Pliocene\u2013Holocene sediment \npulses have been identified in the basins of the Atlantic Margin, in addition to the well \ndocumented pulses of Paleocene age that have been described from the North Sea and Faroe-\nShetland basins (e.g., White and Lovell, 1997; Smallwood, 2008). This record of ~60 Myr of \nnear-continual sediment pulsing implies major uplift and erosion (exhumation) throughout \nthe Cenozoic across likely source areas, such as the British Isles and its continental shelf. \nPrevious studies of the Cenozoic sedimentary record of the Atlantic Margin have emphasized \nthe role of the syn-breakup Iceland plume as the primary tectonic influence on sedimentation \npatterns (White and Lovell, 1997; Jones et al., 2002). However, we have shown that \nsignificant tectonically driven sedimentation continued throughout the Cenozoic Era. Plume-\nrelated underplating is thought to be restricted to the Paleocene (White and Lovell, 1997) and \nthus may have influenced contemporary sedimentation which comprises ~20% of the total \nCenozoic succession, but cannot account for uplift of the source areas of the Eocene, \nPage 5 of 5 \n125 \n126 \n127 \n128 \n129 \n130 \n131 \n132 \n133 \n134 \n135 \n136 \n137 \n138 \n139 \n140 \n141 \n142 \n143 \n144 \n145 \n146 \n147 \n148 \n149 \nOligocene, Miocene\u2013Early Pliocene and Early Pliocene\u2013Holocene phases of sedimentation. \nFurthermore, a recent study of the Cenozoic mass flux history of the Iceland plume (Poore et \nal., 2009) has shown that plume flux (and thus dynamic support) peaked in the early Eocene \nand subsequently declined throughout most of the Cenozoic, indicating that dynamic support \nby the Iceland plume is unlikely to have controlled later sedimentation pulses. However, from \nMiocene times onwards, the body forces generated by plume-related geoid undulation around \nIceland are likely to have increased horizontal stress levels and contributed to widespread \nMiocene compression in the continental margins surrounding Iceland (Dor\u00e9 et al., 2008). \nA recent synthesis of AFTA data (which can provide constraints on the timing of \nexhumation-related cooling) from the British Isles has revealed a complex, multi-stage \nexhumation history for this area (Holford et al., 2009). This synthesis identified several \ndistinct regional episodes of km-scale exhumation beginning between 65 and 55 Ma (which \nmay correlate with the early Paleogene uplift described above), between 40 and 25 Ma and \nbetween 20 and 15 Ma. The latter is the major episode across much of the southern British \nIsles and is characterised by deeper burial of Paleogene rocks in the Irish Sea and southern \nEngland by ~1.5 km prior to uplift beginning in the Early to Mid-Miocene (Hillis et al., 2008; \nHolford et al., 2009). There is also widespread geomorphological evidence for significant \nuplift and exhumation of south\u2013central England during the Late Pliocene\u2013 Pleistocene \n(Maddy, 1997; Watts et al., 2005) that is not identified by AFTA data (which is insensitive to  \nthe thermal histories of samples below ~60 \u00b0C). These episodes correlate closely with plate \nboundary reorganizations during the Cenozoic era (Fig. 3; Holford et al., 2009), thus \nimplying that plate boundary forces exert a key control on vertical motions across this region. \nChanges in the nature of plate boundaries due to plate reorganizations lead to fluctuations in \nthe magnitude of intraplate stresses (e.g. G\u00f6lke and Coblentz, 1996). Uplift and deformation \nalong the Atlantic Margin is manifested by numerous compressional growth anticlines \nPage 6 of 6 \n150 \n151 \n152 \n153 \n154 \n155 \n156 \n157 \n158 \n159 \n160 \n161 \n162 \n163 \n164 \n165 \n166 \n167 \n168 \n169 \n170 \n171 \n172 \n173 \n174 \n(amplitudes \u22644 km; axial traces \u2264 250 km) and reverse faults that have deformed the \nCenozoic succession. In a similar manner to the multiphase uplift and exhumation history of \nthe British Isles, detailed seismic-stratigraphy studies (Andersen et al., 2002; Stoker et al., \n2005; Ritchie et al., 2008) have documented an episodic chronology of compressional \ndeformation along the margin (Fig. 3). \nThe regional impact of these exhumation episodes is demonstrated by their temporal \ncorrelation with the unconformities that bound the major Cenozoic sediment sequences along \nthe Atlantic Margin (Fig. 3). Of particular note are the large-amplitude stratal rotations that \noccurred in association with the formation of the Upper Eocene (\u22644\u00b0) and intra-Pliocene \n(<1\u00b0) unconformities west of Britain and Ireland, indicative of long-wavelength sagging and \ntilting, which Praeg et al. (2005) attributed to evolving patterns of upper mantle convection. \nIncremental rotation and landward truncation of the shelf-margin sediment wedges is clearly \nobserved beneath the Hebrides and West Shetland shelves (Fig. 1). The multi-stage Cenozoic \nexhumation record of the British Isles displays strong temporal correspondence with the \nrecord of Atlantic margin sediment input. The 65\u201355 Ma episode overlaps with the input of \nPaleocene clastic sediments into the North Sea and Faroe-Shetland basins. The 65\u201355 and \n40\u201325 Ma episodes are coeval with the Eocene and Oligocene progradation of shelf-slope \nwedges into the Atlantic Margin basins, while the Miocene\u2013Early Pliocene pulse of \nsedimentation corresponds closely with the 20\u201315 Ma exhumation episode constrained by \nAFTA data. Pliocene\u2013Pleistocene uplift and exhumation is coeval with the latest phase of \nshelf-margin progradation. By correlating the exhumation episodes and unconformities we \ninfer that the shelf-to-deepwater Atlantic Margin basins may also have been initially affected \nby regional uplift, which generated both subaerial and submarine unconformities. The \nsubmarine unconformities were cut by deep-water erosional processes through bottom \ncurrents responding to a change in palaeobathymetry and\/or circulation regime. Following \nPage 7 of 7 \n175 \n176 \n177 \n178 \n179 \n180 \n181 \n182 \n183 \n184 \n185 \n186 \n187 \n188 \n189 \n190 \n191 \n192 \n193 \n194 \n195 \n196 \n197 \n198 \n199 \nthis, the basins acted primarily as the repositories for material eroded from regions where \nexhumation was concentrated. \nWe note that our maps also show significant sediment input into the Atlantic Margin \nbasins from sources beyond the British Isles and its adjacent shelf area. The Eocene and \nOligocene successions include progradational pulses from the Rockall Plateau (Figs. 1 and 2). \nSeismic data demonstrate almost continuous Paleocene to Pleistocene sediment input via \nprograding shelf-slope wedges from the Faroe Platform, where ~46,000 km3 of Palaeocene \nbasalt is thought to have been removed from the Eocene onwards (Andersen et al., 2002). On \nthe outer continental margin, prograding Eocene deposits have been linked to intra-Eocene \ntectonic movements on the Rockall Plateau (McInroy et al., 2006). We suggest that this \npattern of sedimentation is indicative of a margin-wide response to post-rift differential uplift. \nCONCLUSIONS \nWe conclude that post-rift sedimentation off NW Britain represents a direct response \nto episodic passive margin uplift concomitant with plate reorganisation. Regional patterns of \nsedimentation combined with volumetric data, stratal disposition and AFTA analyses imply \nthree major phases of post-rift uplift (Eocene\u2013Oligocene, Miocene and Pliocene\u2013Pleistocene \ntime), following which the sedimentary system was repeatedly rejuvenated. These results are \nincompatible with a post-rift decrease in sedimentation. Instead, the successive tectonic \nepisodes have driven changes in sedimentation patterns, which have in turn found expression \nfrom the shelf to the deep-water basins as regionally significant stratigraphic sequences \nbounded by correlative unconformity surfaces. Our preferred model for the tectonic control \non post-breakup sedimentation in the Atlantic Margin combines short and long-wavelength \ncompressional uplift of sediment source areas in response to fluctuating intraplate stress \nfields whose magnitudes and orientations are governed by the net torques of all the boundary \nforces that act on the plate (e.g. G\u00f6lke and Coblentz, 1996).  Regional phases of tilting and \nPage 8 of 8 \n200 \n201 \n202 \n203 \n204 \n205 \n206 \n207 \n208 \n209 \n210 \n211 \n212 \n213 \n214 \n215 \n216 \n217 \n218 \n219 \n220 \n221 \n222 \n223 \n224 \nsagging may be related to evolving upper mantle convection patterns, whilst enhanced body \nforces resulting from the geoid anomaly around Iceland may be responsible for episodic \ncompression and uplift of the surrounding margins from the Miocene onwards (e.g. Dor\u00e9 et \nal., 2008). \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \nHoward Johnson and Robert Gatliff are thanked for their continuing support of the \nproject, and for their comments on an earlier version of this manuscript.

In the \nstudy area, the dataset largely comprises four decades of geophysical and geological \nacquisition by the British Geological Survey (BGS) as part of its reconnaissance mapping \nprogramme of the United Kingdom continental margin. From 2000 to 2003, these data were \ncombined with additional industry and non-industry data as part of the EC-supported \nSTRATAGEM project (Stratigraphic development of the glaciated European margin), which \nextended the available seismic coverage southwestwards to about 51\u00b0N and northeastwards to \nabout 69\u00b0N. The seismic database comprises tens of thousands of line-kilometres of \nreflection-seismic profiles (high-resolution single and multi-channel), with a grid spacing of \nabout 5 km along the western seaboard of Britain (including the Rockall and Faroe-Shetland \nbasins), but less dense on the outer margin (Rockall Plateau) (cf. Evans et al., 2005 for \ndetails). A unified Cenozoic stratigraphy derived from the seismic database has been \ncalibrated and correlated (using biostratigraphy) by released commercial and non-commercial \n(BGS, DSDP, ODP) wells and shallow boreholes along this length of the NW European \nmargin, the details of which have been published by Stoker et al. (2005).  \n \nIn this study, the distribution and thickness of the Eocene and Oligocene successions has \nbeen determined from regional offshore mapping by the BGS (Stoker et al., 1994; British \nGeological Survey, 2002, 2007; Stoker, 2010; Stoker & Varming, 2010) and from \ncommercial seismic datasets (Robinson, 2004). For the Miocene\u2013Lower Pliocene and Lower \nPliocene\u2013Holocene successions we utilized the STRATAGEM database. The bounding \n1 \n \nsurfaces of all these successions are major regional unconformities that can be traced and \ncorrelated along the entire margin, and are dated by the biostratigraphic data to within 1\u20135 \nMy precision (Stoker et al., 2005; McInroy et al., 2006).  \n \nWe present our maps of preserved sediment thicknesses in seconds (s) two-way travel time \n(TWTT). Accurate depth conversion for Cenozoic sediments along the Atlantic Margin is \ndifficult because of the drilling of relatively few wells, especially in the deep water Rockall \nBasin. Sound velocities in the Cenozoic post-breakup succession are of the order 1.5\u20132.0 km \ns-1, so the thicknesses in TWTT can be taken as maximum estimates in kilometres (i.e. 1 s \nTWTT is \u22641 km).  \n \nAPPENDIX DR2 \nCalculation of total sediment volumes \nWe estimated volumes by converting our TWTT maps into depth-maps using representative \nend-member velocities for the Cenozoic succession of 1.5 and 2.0 km s-1. We then subtracted \nthe pore-space volume predicted by a standard exponential porosity-depth relationship (\u03a6 = \n\u03a60 exp(-z\/ \u03bb) where \u03a6 is the fractional porosity, \u03a60 = 0.6 is initial porosity, z is depth and \u03bb = \n2 km is the compaction coefficient). We digitized the corrected solid grain volume thickness \nmaps and using Surfer 8TM produced grids applying the Nearest Neighbour method from \nwhich we then calculated volumes from using an Extended Trapezoidal Rule.  \n \nAll of our estimates should be considered as minima because of uncertainties in the total \nthickness of each succession, particularly in the main depocentres where well control is poor. \nOur estimates will invariably include a certain proportion of pelagic and hemipelagic \nsediments that have been derived from erosion of source areas eyond the British Isles and \n2 \n \nfrom the Rockall\u2013Faroe region, as evidenced by the increasing influence of Oligocene-\nonwards bottom current activity. Furthermore, there is evidence for erosion of the post-rift \nsuccession itself e.g. the regional intra-Cenozoic unconformities and the compression-\ninfluenced sedimentation patterns in the Miocene-Early Pliocene. Our calculated total \nsediment volumes are compared with previous estimates from the Rockall and Faroe-\nShetland basins, and adjacent basins, in Table DR1. \n \nREFERENCES \nBritish Geological Survey, 2002, Central Rockall Basin Sheet 56\u00b0N, 15\u00b0W, 1:500 000 Series, \nBedrock Geology: British Geological Survey and Petroleum Affairs Division, Ireland, \nISBN 978-075183342-3 \nBritish Geological Survey, 2007, North Rockall Basin Sheet 58\u00b0N, 13\u00b0W, 1:500 000 Series, \nBedrock Geology: British Geological Survey, ISBN 978-075183499-4. \nEvans, D., Stoker, M.S., Shannon, P.M. and STRATAGEM Partners, 2005, The \nSTRATAGEM Project: Stratigraphic development of the glaciated European margin: \nMarine and Petroleum Geology, v. 22, p. 969\u2013976, doi: \n10.1016\/j.marpetgeo.2005.02.002. \nJones, S.M., White, N., Clarke, B.J., Rowley, E., and Gallagher, K., 2002, Present and past \ninfluence of the Iceland Plume on sedimentation, in Dor\u00e9 et al., eds., Exhumation of the \nNorth Atlantic Margin: Timing, Mechanisms and Implications for Petroleum \nExploration: Geological Society, London, Special Publications, v. 196, p. 13\u201325. \nLiu, X., and Galloway, W.E., 1997, Quantitative determination of Tertiary sediment supply to \nthe North Sea Basin: American Association of Petroleum Geologists Bulletin, v. 81, p. \n1482\u20131509. \n3 \n \nMcInroy, D.B., Hitchen, K., and Stoker, M.S., 2006, Potentail Eocene and Oligocene \nstratigraphic traps of the Rockall Plateau, NE Atlantic Ocean, in Allen, M.R., et al., eds, \nThe Deliberate Search for the Stratigraphic Trap: Geological Society, London, Special \nPublications, v. 254, p. 247\u2013266. \nReynolds, T., 1994, Quantitative analysis of submarine fans in the Tertiary of the North Sea \nBasin: Marine and Petroleum Geology, v. 11, p. 202\u2013207. \nRobinson, A.M., 2004, Stratigraphic Development and Controls on the Architecture of \nEocene Depositional Systems in the Faroe-Shetland Basin: Ph.D. Unpublished, \nUniversity of Cardiff, Wales, UK, 464 p. \nSmallwood, J.R., 2005, Quantity, distribution and provenance of Paleocene sediments in the \nFaroe\u2013Shetland area, in Ziska, H., et al., eds., Faroe Islands Exploration Conference: \nProceedings of the 1st Conference: Annales Societatis Scientiarum F\u00e6roensis, \nSupplementum 43, T\u00f3rshavn, p. 82\u201395. \nSmallwood, J.R., 2008, Uplift, compression and the Cenozoic Faroe\u2013Shetland  sediment \nbudget, in Johnson, H., et al., eds., The Nature of Compression in Passive Margins: \nGeological Society, London, Special Publications, v. 306, p. 127\u2013152, doi: \n10.1144\/SP306.5. \nStoker, M.S., 2010, Cenozoic sedimentary rocks, in Hitchen, K., ed., United Kingdom \nOffshore Regional Report: The Geology of the Rockall Basin: London, Her Majesty\u2019s \nStationery Office for the British Geological Survey, (in press). \nStoker, M.S., and Varming, T., 2010,  Cenozoic sedimentary rocks, in Ritchie, J.D. and \nZiska, H., eds., United Kingdom Offshore Regional Report: The Geology of the Faroe-\nShetland Basin: London, Her Majesty\u2019s Stationery Office for the British Geological \nSurvey, (in press). \n4 \n \nStoker, M.S., Leslie, A.B., Scott, W.D., Briden, J.C., Hine, N.M., Harland, R., Wilksinson, \nI.P., Evans, D., and Ardus, D.A., 1994, A record of late Cenozoic stratigraphy, \nsedimentation and climate change from the Hebrides Slope, NE Atlantic Ocean: Journal \nof the Geological Society, London, v. 151, p. 235\u2013249. \nStoker, M.S., Praeg, D., Hjelstuen, B.O., Laberg, J.S., Nielsen, T., and Shannon, P.M., 2005, \nNeogene stratigraphy and the sedimentary and oceanographic development of the NW \nEuropean Atlantic margin: Marine & Petroleum Geology, v. 22, p. 977\u20131005, doi: \n1016\/j.marpetgeo.2004.11.007. \nWhite, N., and Lovell, B., 1997, Measuring the pulse of a plume within the sedimentary \nrecord: Nature, v. 387, p. 888\u2013891. \n5 \n \n 6 \n \nTable DR1.
