CARLSON \u2217, NADIA MAZZA, AND JACQUES THE\u00b4VENAZ\n1. Introduction\nSuppose that G is a finite group and that k is a field of characteristic p. Endotrivial kG-modules\nappear in a natural way in many areas surrounding local analysis of finite groups. They were\nintroduced by Dade [14] who classified them in the case that G is an abelian p-group. A complete\nclassification of endotrivial modules over the modular group rings of p-groups was completed just\na few years ago [5, 10, 11, 12]. The class of all endotrivial modules for a given group G gives rise to\nan abelian group T (G) (with respect to the tensor product). This group is finitely generated and\ncarries with it all of the information of the classification. The group T (G) is of interest because\nit is an important part of the Picard group of self-equivalences of the stable category of finitely\ngenerated kG-modules. The so-called self-equivalences of Morita type are induced by tensoring\nwith endotrivial modules. For this reason, it is of interest to extend the classification beyond\np-groups to general finite groups. Some progress has been made in that direction [6, 7, 8, 9, 21].\nIn this paper we consider two out-lying situations where the answer to a different sort of problem\nis sought. In the classification of endotrivial modules over p-groups, there are exactly two cases\nin which the group T (P ) of endotrivial modules for a non-cyclic p-group P has torsion elements.\nThe two cases case occur when p = 2 and P is either quaternion (meaning ordinary or generalized\nquaternion) or semi-dihedral. For a group G having such a P as its Sylow 2-subgroup, the question\nis whether the restriction map T (G) \u2192 T (P ) is surjective. Specifically, we need to know if the\ntorsion elements in T (P ) are in the image of the restriction. Do these modules lift or extend in\nsome way from P to G? In this paper we show that the answer is yes, the restriction map is\nsurjective. In the course of the investigation we are able to find much more information about\nthe structure of T (G) and about the modules themselves. The only other case in which T (P ) has\ntorsion elements occurs when P is cyclic, and this case was treated in [21].\nIt is somewhat surprising that the two cases require very different methods. In the situation\nwhere the Sylow 2-subgroup P of G is quaternion and the unique involution in P is central in G, we\nuse a general method for finding exotic endotrivial modules as subquotients of \u21262(k), the second\nsyzygy of the the trivial module k. This method has been used in earlier papers [5, 7]. There\nare two means for extending this result to general groups with quaternion Sylow 2-subgroups.\nOne involves invoking the Brauer-Suzuki Theorem [4] on the stucture of such group. The more\nelementary method is to note that the centralizer of the involution of P is a strongly 2-embedded\nsubgroup of G and we can apply a theorem of [21]. These results appear in Sections 3 and 4, after\nDate: April 22, 2010.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary 20C20, 20C30.\n\u2217 Partially supported by a grant from NSF.\n1\n2 JON F. CARLSON \u2217, NADIA MAZZA, AND JACQUES THE\u00b4VENAZ\na general introduction to endotrivial modules in Section 2. Moreover, we prove in Section 5 that\nthere are always torsion endotrivial modules which are uniserial.\nBy contrast, the key to the semi-dihedral case is the theory of Auslander-Reiten sequences or\nalmost split sequences. In Section 6, we construct exotic endotrivial modules over finite groups\nhaving a semi-dihedral Sylow 2-subgroup, by using a certain Auslander-Reiten sequence which\nhas as middle term the heart Rad(Rk)\/ Soc(Rk) of the projective cover Rk of the trivial module.\nThe existence of this sequence is related to the fact that the component of the stable Auslander-\nReiten quiver containing \u2126(k) has tree class D\u221e. This is an important result due to K. Erdmann\n[19, 17, 18].\n2. Preliminaries\nThroughout this paper, we let k denote an algebraically closed field of prime characteristic p. From\nSection 3 onwards, we will assume that p = 2. In addition, we assume that all modules are finitely\ngenerated. In this section, we briefly recap some needed basics.\nGiven a finite group H, we write k for the trivial kH-module, or, whenever H needs to be\nclarified, we write kH instead. Unless otherwise specified, the symbol \u2297 is the tensor product \u2297k\nof the underlying vector spaces, and in case of kH-modules, then H acts diagonally on the factors.\nIf M is a kH-module, and \u03d5 : Q \u2192 M its projective cover, then we let \u2126(M) denote the kernel\nof \u03d5. Likewise, if \u03d1 : M \u2192 Q is the injective hull of M (recall that kH is a self-injective ring so Q\nis also projective), then \u2126\u22121(M) denotes the cokernel of \u03d1. Inductively, with \u21261(M) = \u2126(M), we\nset \u2126n(M) = \u2126(\u2126n\u22121(M)) and \u2126\u2212n(M) = \u2126\u22121(\u2126\u2212n+1(M)) for all integers n > 1.\nIf G is a finite group of order divisible by p, then a kG-module M is endotrivial if its endomor-\nphism algebra Endk(M) is isomorphic (as a kG-module) to the direct sum of the trivial module\nkG and a projective kG-module. In other words, a kG-module M is endotrivial if and only if\nM\u2217\u2297M \u223c= k\u2295 (proj), where M\u2217 denotes the k-dual Homk(M,k) of M , and (proj) some projective\nmodule.\nLemma 2.1. Let G be a finite group of order divisible by p.\n(1) Let M be a kG-module. If M is endotrivial, then M splits as the direct sum M\u0005 \u2295 (proj)\nfor an indecomposable endotrivial kG-module M\u0005, which is unique up to isomorphism.\n(2) The relation\nM \u223c N \u21d0\u21d2 M\u0005 \u223c= N\u0005\non the class of endotrivial kG-modules is an equivalence relation. We let T (G) be the set\nof equivalence classes. Every equivalence class contains a unique indecomposable module\nup to isomorphism.\n(3) The tensor product induces an abelian group structure on the set T (G) by\n[M ] + [N ] = [M \u2297N ] .\nThe zero element of T (G) is the class [k] of the trivial module, consisting of all modules\nof the form k \u2295 (proj). The inverse of the class of a module M is the class of the dual\nmodule M\u2217.\nThe group T (G) is called the group of endotrivial kG-modules. It is known to be a finitely\ngenerated abelian group. In particular, the torsion subgroup TT (G) of T (G) is finite. The torsion-\nfree rank of T (G) can be described explicitly (see [7]).\nWe often use the following fact (see [10, Lemma 2.9]).\nENDOTRIVIAL MODULES 3\nLemma 2.2. For a kG-module M , if the restriction of M to every elementary abelian p-subgroup\nof G is an endotrivial module, then M is an endotrivial module.\nWe use the following easy result.\nLemma 2.3. Let P be a Sylow p-subgroup of G and let M be an endotrivial kG-module.\n(1) If p is odd, then Dim(M) \u2261 \u00b11 (mod |P |).\n(2) If p = 2, then Dim(M) \u2261 \u00b11 (mod |P |\/2).\nProof. By the very definition, we have Dim(M)2 = Dim(Endk(M)) = 1 +n, where n is the dimen-\nsion of a projective module. Since a projective module is free on restriction to P , its dimension\nmust be a multiple of |P |. Hence\nDim(M)2 \u2261 1 (mod |P |) .\nThus Dim(M) is a square root of 1 modulo |P | and the result follows. \u0003\nWhen p = 2, the congruence Dim(M) \u2261 |P |\/2 \u00b1 1 (mod |P |) does not happen very often, but\nit does occur when P is either quaternion or semi-dihedral. We shall say that an endotrivial kG-\nmodule M is exotic if M is indecomposable and if Dim(M) \u2261 |P |\/2 + 1 (mod |P |), where P is a\nSylow 2-subgroup of G (and p = 2 of course).\nThe motivation for the present research stems out of the classification of endotrivial modules\nover finite p-groups. The results we need are summarized as follows.\nTheorem 2.4. Let P be a nontrivial finite p-group.\n(1) If P is cyclic of order \u2265 3, then T (P ) \u223c= Z\/2Z. If P is cyclic of order 2, then T (P ) = {0}.\n(2) If P is generalized quaternion, then T (P ) \u223c= Z\/2Z\u2295Z\/4Z. The summand Z\/2Z is generated\nby the class of an indecomposable endotrivial module U which is exotic and self-dual. The\nsecond summand is generated by the class of the syzygy \u2126(k) of the trivial module, which\nhas order 4.\n(3) If P is semi-dihedral, then T (P ) \u223c= Z\/2Z \u2295 Z. The summand Z\/2Z is generated by the\nclass of an indecomposable endotrivial module U which is exotic and self-dual. The second\nsummand is generated by the class of the syzygy \u2126(k) of the trivial module, which has\ninfinite order.\n(4) If P is not cyclic, generalized quaternion, or semi-dihedral, then T (P ) is torsion-free.\nStatement (1) is easy (see [14]). Statement (2) is proved in [10], and also implicitly in [15].\nStatement (3) is proved in [10], while (4) is one of the main results in [12].\nRemark 2.5. If P is a semi-dihedral group, then the module U in statement (3) is unique up\nto isomorphism, because TT (P ) \u223c= Z\/2Z, so U is the only nontrivial indecomposable endotrivial\nmodule such that U \u223c= U\u2217. Moreover, \u21262n(U) is again exotic for every n \u2208 Z, but not self-dual\nunless n = 0.\nRemark 2.6. If P is a quaternion group, then there are two possible exotic generators for the\nsummand of T (P ) isomorphic to Z\/2Z in statement (2), namely, U and \u21262(U). The subgroup of\nelements of order 2 in T (P ) is a Klein four group Z\/2Z \u2295 Z\/2Z, generated by [U ] and [\u21262(k)].\nThere are 3 elements of order 2, one of them being [\u21262(k)]. The other two are the classes of\nthe two exotic modules U and \u21262(U). Note that we have [\u21262(U)] = [U ] + [\u21262(k)] in T (P ). The\nmodules \u2126i(k) (for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 3) have dimension |P | \u00b1 1, the two exotic kP -modules U and \u21262(U)\n4 JON F. CARLSON \u2217, NADIA MAZZA, AND JACQUES THE\u00b4VENAZ\nhave dimension |P |\/2 + 1, and the two remaining indecomposable endotrivial kP -modules (which\nare actually \u2126(U) and \u21263(U)) have dimension |P |\/2\u2212 1.\nWe end this section with a review of a few facts about support varieties that will be needed,\nparticularly in the next section.\nThe cohomology ring H\u2217(G, k) is a finitely generated, graded commutative k-algebra and has\na maximal ideal spectrum VG(k) which is a homogeneous affine variety. If M is a finitely gen-\nerated kG-module, then its cohomology ring Ext\u2217kG(M,M) is a finitely generated module over\nH\u2217(G, k), and we let J(M) denote its annihilator in H\u2217(G, k). The support variety of M is the\nset VG(M) = VG(J(M)) \u2286 VG(k) of all maximal ideals that contain J(M). Hence, VG(M) is a\nclosed homogeneous subvariety of VG(k). The support varieties have some important properties.\nThe properties were developed by many people. Proofs and history can be found in the standard\nreferences [3, 13].\nOne of the most valuable tools in the theory of module varieties is the theorem of Quillen which\nsays that\nVG(k) =\n\u22c3\nE\u2208EA\nres\u2217G,E(VE(k))\nwhere EA is the collection of all elementary abelian p-subgroups of G. A consequence of this\ntheorem is the theorem of Chouinard which states that a finitely generated kG-module M is\nprojective if and only if it is projective on restriction to every elementary abelian p-subgroup of G.\nThis result is included in the theorem that follows. This theorem presents most of the properties\nof support varieties that will be needed in the paper.\nTheorem 2.7. Suppose that L, M and N are kG-modules.\n(1) The module M is projective if and only if VG(M) = {0}.\n(2) A kG-module M is projective if and only if its restriction to every elementary abelian\np-subgroup of G is projective.\n(3) VG(M\u2217) = VG(\u2126n(M)) = VG(M), for any integer n.\n(4) VG(M \u2295N) = VG(M) \u222a VG(N).\n(5) VG(M \u2297N) = VG(M) \u2229 VG(N).\n(6) If the sequence 0\u2192 L\u2192M \u2192 N \u2192 0 is exact, then VG(M) \u2286 VG(L) \u222a VG(N).\n(7) VG(M) = \u222aE\u2208EA res\u2217G,E(VE(M)).\n(8) Suppose that VG(M) = V1 \u222a V2 where V1 and V2 are closed sets such that V1 \u2229 V2 = {0}.\nThen M \u223c= M1 \u2295M2 where VG(M1) = V1 and VG(M2) = V2.\n(9) Suppose that \u03b6 \u2208 Hn(G, k), and let \u03b6\u02c6 : \u2126n(k) \u2192 k be a cocycle representing \u03b6. Let L\u03b6\ndenote the kernel of \u03b6\u02c6. Then VG(L\u03b6) = VG(\u03b6).\n3. The second syzygy of the trivial module\nIn this section we analyze the structure of the second syzygy \u21262(k) of the trivial module for a finite\ngroup G with a quaternion Sylow 2-subgroup P . We assume that the unique involution z of P is\ncentral in G. This assumption is required by the methods that we use. However, statements made\nabout \u21262(k) or about any module in the principal block of kG hold without the assumption on\nthe centrality of z, because we know from the Brauer-Suzuki Theorem [4] that the image of z is\ncentral in G\/O2\u2032(G) and O2\u2032(G) is the kernel of the principal block of kG. In addition, from now\non, we assume that the characteristic of k is 2.\nENDOTRIVIAL MODULES 5\nWe set G = G\/\u3008z\u3009 and H = H\/\u3008z\u3009 for any subgroup H of G containing z. We also write x for\nthe image of x \u2208 G in G. For a kG-module V , let\nV0 = {v \u2208 V | (z \u2212 1)v = 0} .\nNote that V0 is a kG-module. Moreover, V0 contains the submodule (z \u2212 1)V and multiplication\nby z \u2212 1 induces an isomorphism V\/V0 \u223c= (z \u2212 1)V .\nApplying this to the module M = \u21262(k), we notice that\nM\u2193G\u3008z\u3009 \u223c= \u21262(k\u3008z\u3009)\u2295R = k\u3008z\u3009 \u2295R\nwhere R is a projective k\u3008z\u3009-module. Since (z \u2212 1)R = R0, we deduce that M0\/(z \u2212 1)M is\none-dimensional. Thus M = \u21262(k) has a filtration\n{0} \u2282 (z \u2212 1)M \u2282M0 \u2282M\nwith the top M\/M0 isomorphic to the bottom (z\u22121)M and with a one-dimensional middle module\nM0\/(z \u2212 1)M (which is actually the trivial module, see Proposition 3.5).\nProposition 3.1. Suppose that P is a quaternion 2-group. Let M = \u21262(k). Then M0 \u223c= \u21262(kP )\nas a kP -module.\nProof. This result could be proved by exhibiting a presentation for the module \u21262(k) and meticu-\nlously constructing an isomorphism. However, we prove the result using more theoretical methods\nwhich illuminate some of the ideas in this paper.\nFirst suppose that |P | = 8, so that P is a Klein four group. Then Dim(M) = 9 and because\nthe restriction of M to \u3008z\u3009 is the direct sum of a trivial module and 4 copies of k\u3008z\u3009, we have\nthat Dim(M0) = 5. Also Dim(Soc(M0)) = Dim(Soc(M)) = 2, and M0 has no non-zero free\nkP -direct summand, because such a summand would lift to a free direct summand of M as a\nkP -module (by Proposition 4.2 below), but M is indecomposable. By the classification of the\nindecomposable modules over a Klein four group (see [3, Theorem 4.3.3]), we know that \u21262(kP )\nis, up to isomorphism, the only indecomposable kP -module whose dimension is 5 and whose socle\nhas dimension 2. So we need only show that M0 is indecomposable.\nSo assume that M0 decomposes. If M0 had a 4-dimensional direct summand, it could not be\nfree, hence the dimension of its socle would be at least 2 and so Dim(Soc(M)) \u2265 3, which is a\ncontradiction. Thus M0 would be a direct sum of a module of dimension 3 (which is isomorphic\nto \u2126(kP )) and a module of dimension 2. But M0 is defined over F2 and the decomposition must\nalso exist over F2. However, every indecomposable 2-dimensional F2P -module has the form F2\u2191PH\nfor H a subgroup of index 2 in P . In particular, on restriction to H, this 2-dimensional module is\nthe direct sum of two trivial modules.\nNow H = \u3008x\u3009 for some element x of order 4 in P . Since H = \u3008x\u3009 is cyclic, \u21262(kH) \u223c= kH ,\nand therefore M\u2193PH is the direct sum of a trivial module and two copies of kH. It follows that\nM0\u2193PH is the direct sum of a trivial module and two copies of kH. Therefore, we cannot have two\ntrivial modules as direct summands and the proposed decomposition of M0 is not possible. This\ncompletes the proof in the case that |P | = 8.\nAssume now that |P | > 8. In this situation, P is a dihedral group and P has two quaternion\nsubgroups E1 and E2 of order 8, such that E1 and E2 are representatives of the two conjugacy\nclasses of maximal elementary abelian 2-subgroups of P . Let E be either E1 or E2. The restriction\n6 JON F. CARLSON \u2217, NADIA MAZZA, AND JACQUES THE\u00b4VENAZ\nof M to a kE-module has the form\nM\u2193PE \u223c= \u21262(kE)\u2295 F\nwhere F is a free kE-module. Since E is quaternion of order 8, it follows from the first part of the\nproof that the restriction of M0 to E has the form\nM0\u2193PE \u223c= \u21262(kE)\u2295 (z \u2212 1)F.\nHere, (z \u2212 1)F is a free kE-module. Consequently, M0 is an endotrivial kP -module since its\nrestriction to every elementary abelian 2-subgroup is an endotrivial module (see Lemma 2.2). By\nthe classification of endotrivial modules over dihedral 2-groups [10], M0 \u223c= \u21262(kP ) \u2295 Q, for some\nprojective module Q. However, the dimension of M0 is |P |\/2 + 1, which is also the dimension of\n\u21262(kP ). Hence Q = 0 and M0 \u223c= \u21262(kP ). \u0003\nContinuing with the module M = \u21262(k) as in Proposition 3.1, we require also some further\ninformation on the decomposition of the kP -module (z \u2212 1)M , which is a maximal submodule\nof M0.\nProposition 3.2. Suppose that P is a quaternion 2-group. Let M = \u21262(k).\n(1) The module (z \u2212 1)M decomposes as (z \u2212 1)M \u223c= N1 \u2295 N2, with Dim(N1) = Dim(N2) =\n|P |\/4.\n(2) N1 and N2 are indecomposable.\n(3) If |P | = 8, then the support varieties VP (N1) and VP (N2) are distinct lines in VP (k) \u223c= k2.\n(4) If |P | > 8, then VP (N1) and VP (N2) are lines in the two different components of the variety\nVP (k). In particular, N1 is free on restriction to any element of one of the conjugacy classes\nof maximal elementary abelian subgroups, and N2 is free on restriction to any elementary\nabelian subgroup in the other conjugacy class.\nProof. Suppose first that |P | = 8. We follow exactly the arguments of [5]. We know that\nDim((z \u2212 1)M) = 4 and that any direct summand of (z \u2212 1)M must have even dimension since it\nis free on restriction to \u3008x\u3009 for any x in P . Consequently, there are at most two summands and\nthe variety VP ((z \u2212 1)M) is the union of at most two lines. However, the variety does not contain\nany F2-rational line since such a line corresponds to a subgroup \u3008x\u3009 and we know that \u3008x\u3009 acts\nfreely on the module. On the other hand, (z \u2212 1)M is defined over F2 and hence its variety is\nF2-rational. The only possibility is that the variety is the zero set of a quadratic polynomial which\nis irreducible over F2. Over k, such a polynomial splits into two distinct linear factors. It follows\nthat the module (z \u2212 1)M is the direct sum of two submodules (by Theorem 2.7(8)), the variety\nof each being the zero set of one of the factors. Hence, this case is settled.\nWe now suppose that the order of P is greater than 8. We consider the exact sequence\n0 \/\/ (z \u2212 1)M \/\/ M0 \u03b6 \/\/ k \/\/ 0\nwhere \u03b6 is the natural quotient map. By Proposition 3.1, M0 \u223c= \u21262(kP ) and so \u03b6 represents a\ncohomology element in\nExt2\nkP\n(k, k) \u223c= HomkP (\u21262(k), k) .\nHence, by Theorem 2.7(9), VP ((z \u2212 1)M) = VP (\u03b6) is the zero locus of the cohomology element \u03b6\n(note that (z \u2212 1)M = L\u03b6 in the standard notation, used for instance in [5] and [13]).\nENDOTRIVIAL MODULES 7\nLet x denote the central involution in the dihedral group P . Because x acts freely on (z\u2212 1)M ,\nthe sequence splits on restriction to \u3008x\u3009 and it follows that the restriction of \u03b6 to the cyclic center\n\u3008x\u3009 of P is not zero.\nNow we follow the method of [5]. Because the element \u03b6 restricts to a non-nilpotent element of\nthe cohomology ring of the center of P , VP (\u03b6) is the union of two non-empty closed sets which are\nin different components of the variety VP (k). These components correspond to the two conjugacy\nclasses of maximal elementary abelian subgroups of P and hence we get the decomposition of\n(z \u2212 1)M into the direct sum of two submodules N1 and N2 having the properties stated in (4).\nTo prove the statement about dimensions, we note that\nDim(\u21262(k)) = |P |+ 1 so that Dim((z \u2212 1)M) = |P |\/2 .\nThe two modules N1 and N2 must have the same dimension because there is an outer automorphism\nof P of order 2, which fixes z, preserves the module \u21262(k), and interchanges the two components of\nthe variety. Hence it must interchange the modules N1 and N2. So Dim(Ni) = |P |\/4 for i = 1, 2.\nFinally we prove the indecomposability of N1 and N2. Let H be a cyclic subgroup of P of\nindex 2. Then M\u2193PH \u223c= \u21262(k)\u2295 (free) = k\u2295 (free) and therefore ((z\u22121)M)\u2193PH is a free kH-module\nof dimension |P |\/2 = 2|H|. Thus ((z \u2212 1)M)\u2193P\nH\n\u223c= kH \u2295 kH, a direct sum of two indecomposable\nmodules of dimension |P |\/4. This forces N1 and N2 to be indecomposable. \u0003\nRemark 3.3. We have chosen for simplicity to work over an algebraically closed field k, but we\nnote that if P is quaternion of order 8, then (z \u2212 1)M decomposes as N1 \u2295N2 whenever the base\nfield k contains cubic roots of unity, because the two lines in VP ((z\u2212 1)M) are not F2-rational but\nthey are defined over F4. In contrast, if P is quaternion of order at least 16, then the two lines in\nVP ((z \u2212 1)M) are F2-rational and the decomposition (z \u2212 1)M = N1 \u2295N2 holds over any field k\nof characteristic 2.\nNow we pass from 2-groups to the general case.\nProposition 3.4. Let G be a group with a quaternion Sylow 2-subgroup P and assume that the\nunique involution z of P is central in G. Let M = \u21262(k).\n(1) The support variety VG((z \u2212 1)M) has two components V1 and V2 and the kG-module\n(z \u2212 1)M decomposes as (z \u2212 1)M \u223c= L1 \u2295 L2, where VG(L1) = V1 and VG(L2) = V2.\n(2) For i = 1, 2, we have that Li\u2193GP \u223c= Ni \u2295Qi, where Ni is the kP -module of Proposition 3.2\nand Qi is a projective kP -module.\n(3) Dim(Li) is congruent to |P |\/4 modulo |P |\/2.\n(4) L1 and L2 are indecomposable.\nProof. We know that M\u2193GP \u223c= \u21262(kP )\u2295 (proj) and consequently\n((z \u2212 1)M)\u2193G\nP\n= (z \u2212 1)(M\u2193GP ) \u223c= (z \u2212 1)\u21262(kP )\u2295 (proj)\nas a kP -module. So by Proposition 3.2, the support variety of the restriction ((z \u2212 1)M)\u2193G\nP\nis the\nunion of two components. We first note that these components are not conjugate under the action\nof G. If |P | = 8, this is because the variety VP ((z \u2212 1)M) consists of two lines which cannot be\nconjugate under any automorphism of the quaternion group. Likewise, if |P | > 8, the components\nof VP ((z \u2212 1)M) are not conjugate because there is no element of G which interchanges the two\nconjugacy classes of maximal elementary abelian subgroups of the dihedral group P . Consequently,\n8 JON F. CARLSON \u2217, NADIA MAZZA, AND JACQUES THE\u00b4VENAZ\nin either case, the support variety VG((z \u2212 1)M) also has two components V1 and V2. Hence the\nkG-module (z \u2212 1)M must decompose as a direct sum\n(z \u2212 1)M = L1 \u2295 L2\nin such a way that VG(Li) = Vi for i = 1, 2 (see Theorem 2.7(8)).\nBy construction, we have that Li\u2193GP = Ni \u2295Qi where Ni is the module of Proposition 3.2 and\nQi is a projective kP -module. Since Dim(Ni) = |P |\/4 and Dim(Qi) is a multiple of |P |\/2, we\ndeduce that Dim(Li) is congruent to |P |\/4 modulo |P |\/2.\nTo prove the indecomposability of L1 and L2, we assume that Li = L\u2032i\u2295L\u2032\u2032i . Since Li\u2193GP = Ni\u2295Qi\nand Ni is indecomposable, we get L\u2032i\u2193GP = Ni\u2295Q\u2032i and L\u2032\u2032i \u2193GP = Q\u2032\u2032i , where Q\u2032i and Q\u2032\u2032i are projective\nkP -modules. Therefore L\u2032\u2032i is projective, because P is a Sylow 2-subgroup of G. By a result to\nbe proved in the next section (see Proposition 4.2), this implies that the kG-module M also has\na projective direct summand R such that (z \u2212 1)R \u223c= L\u2032\u2032i . But M is indecomposable, so R = 0,\nhence L\u2032\u2032i = 0 and L\n\u2032\ni = Li. \u0003\nProposition 3.4 will be sufficient for the construction of exotic endotrivial modules and the\ndetermination of the group T (G) of endotrivial modules in Section 4. However, for more specific\ninformation about endotrivial modules, we shall need the following result.\nProposition 3.5. Let G be a group with a quaternion Sylow 2-subgroup P . Then we have the\nfollowing.\n(1) \u21264(k) \u223c= k.\n(2) \u21262(k) is self-dual.\n(3) Assume that the unique involution z of P is central in G. Let M = \u21262(k). Then the\none-dimensional module M0\/(z \u2212 1)M is the trivial module.\nProof. (1) The result is well-known, but we sketch an argument. Let H = NG(P ). The Green\ncorrespondents of \u21264(kG) and kG are \u21264(kH) and kH respectively. So it suffices to prove the\nresult over H. If |P | > 8, then Aut(P ) is a 2-group and therefore NG(P )\/PCG(P ) = 1, that is,\nH = PCG(P ). Then a complement C of P in H centralizes P and H = P \u00d7 C. Now C acts\ntrivially on \u21264(kH) and so this module is inflated from \u21264(kP ). Finally it is well-known that for\na quaternion group P , we have \u21264(kP ) \u223c= k (see for instance [15, Proposition 3.16]). If |P | = 8,\nthen NG(P )\/PCG(P ) has order 1 or 3. Again PCG(P ) = P \u00d7 C and C is normal in H. Since\nC acts trivially on \u21264(kH), we are left with the group H\/C which is isomorphic to either P or\nP o C3. In the latter case, a direct computation (by hand as in [15] or using MAGMA [2]) shows\nthat \u21264(k) \u223c= k.\n(2) It follows from (1) that \u21262(k) \u223c= \u2126\u22122(k), that is \u21262(k) \u223c= \u21262(k)\u2217.\n(3) We know that M0\/(z \u2212 1)M is one-dimensional (because M \u2193G\u3008z\u3009 \u223c= k \u2295 (free)). Now one-\ndimensional modules are detected on restriction to H = NG(P ). This follows either from the\nGreen correspondence or from the fact that H[G,G] = G (because H[G,G] is normal in G because\nit contains [G,G] and selfnormalizing since it contains H). Therefore, it suffices to prove the\nresult for H. As in part (1), C acts trivially and it suffices to prove the result for H\/C, which is\nisomorphic to either P or P oC3. In the former case any one-dimensional module is trivial, while\nin the latter case we conclude by a direct computation. \u0003\nENDOTRIVIAL MODULES 9\n4. Groups with quaternion Sylow 2-subgroup\nLetG be a group with a quaternion Sylow 2-subgroup P . Our purpose in this section is to determine\nthe group T (G) of endotrivial modules for G. We continue to assume that k is an algebraically\nclosed field of characteristic 2. We let z be the unique involution of P and H = CG(z). Then H\nis strongly 2-embedded in G and therefore we have the following result.\nLemma 4.1. The restriction map ResGH : T (G) \u2212\u2192 T (H) is an isomorphism. Moreover, the Green\ncorrespondent of any indecomposable endotrivial kH-module is an indecomposable endotrivial kG-\nmodule.\nProof. The first statement is proved in [7, Proposition 2.8] or [21, Lemma 2.7]. The second state-\nment is actually implicit in the first. The thing to notice here is that H contains the normalizer\nof P and if g \u2208 G, g \/\u2208 H then P \u2229 gPg\u22121 = {1}. Hence the Mackey formula tells us that if M is\nan indecomposable kH-module, then (M\u2191GH )\u2193GH \u223c= M \u2295 (proj). This is the essence of the proof of\nthe first statement of the lemma. The statement about Green correspondents is now obvious. \u0003\nThus it suffices to determine T (H). Now H has a nontrivial normal 2-subgroup \u3008z\u3009. Therefore,\nby [21, Lemma 2.6], there is an exact sequence\n0 \/\/ X(H) \/\/ T (H)\nResHP \/\/ T (P )\nwhere X(H) denotes the subgroup of T (H) consisting of the classes of all one-dimensional kH-\nmodules. Clearly X(H) is isomorphic to Hom(H, k\u2217), hence to the 2\u2032-part of the abelianization\nof H.\nWe are going to prove that the restriction map ResHP is surjective and we do this by constructing\nexotic endotrivial modules for the group H. This is based on a construction which was already\nused in [12] and [5], and which takes the following form in characteristic 2. Note that, for p-groups,\npart (2) appears already in [10, Lemma 3.3] and [12, Lemma 5.3].\nProposition 4.2. Let G be a group with a central involution z and let G = G\/\u3008z\u3009. Let M be a\nkG-module such that M\u2193G\u3008z\u3009 \u223c= k \u2295 (proj). Assume that L is a direct summand of (z \u2212 1)M .\n(1) There exist submodules {0} \u2286 V \u2286 U \u2286 M such that the subquotient W = U\/V has the\nproperties that W\u2193G\u3008z\u3009 \u223c= k \u2295 (proj) and (z \u2212 1)W \u223c= L.\n(2) If L is a projective kG-module, then W \u223c= K \u2295Q for some one-dimensional kG-module K\nand some projective kG-module Q such that (z\u22121)Q \u223c= L. Moreover, Q is also isomorphic\nto a direct summand of M (as a kG-module).\nProof. Set (z\u22121)M = L\u2295L\u2032. As in Section 3, we let M0 = {m \u2208M | (z\u22121)m = 0}. Multiplication\nby (z \u2212 1) induces an isomorphism from M\/M0 to (z \u2212 1)M and M has a filtration\n{0} \u2282 (z \u2212 1)M \u2282M0 \u2282M\nwith the top M\/M0 isomorphic to the bottom (z\u22121)M and with a one-dimensional middle module\nM0\/(z\u22121)M (because M\u2193G\u3008z\u3009 \u223c= k\u2295 (free)). Moreover, M\/M0 = N \u2295N \u2032, with N \u223c= L and N \u2032 \u223c= L\u2032\nvia multiplication by z \u2212 1.\nLet U be the inverse image of N in M , so that U\/M0 = N and (z\u22121)U = L. Let W = U\/L\u2032. As\nbefore, let W0 = {w \u2208W | (z \u2212 1)w = 0}. By construction we have isomorphisms of kG-modules\n(z \u2212 1)W \u223c= L and W\/W0 \u223c= N \u223c= L .\n10 JON F. CARLSON \u2217, NADIA MAZZA, AND JACQUES THE\u00b4VENAZ\nIn particular, the rank of multiplication by (z\u2212 1) on W is the dimension of L, and the dimension\nof W is 2 Dim(L)+1. It follows that W\u2193G\u3008z\u3009 is the direct sum of a trivial module and a free module\n(because the rank of multiplication by (z \u2212 1) is 0 on k and is 1 on k\u3008z\u3009, and these are the only\nindecomposable k\u3008z\u3009-modules). This proves (1).\nAssume now that L is projective, so that (z \u2212 1)W is a projective kG-module. Then (z \u2212 1)W\nis also an injective kG-module, and the exact sequence\n0 \/\/ (z \u2212 1)W \/\/ W0 \/\/ W0\/(z \u2212 1)W \/\/ 0\nsplits and W0 has a one-dimensional submodule K such that W0 = (z \u2212 1)W \u2295 K. We claim\nthat the kG-module Q = W\/K is projective. It suffices to prove this on restriction to a Sylow\np-subgroup P of G. Notice that Q0 = (z \u2212 1)Q = (z + 1)Q and this is isomorphic to (z \u2212 1)W ,\nhence projective over kP . Moreover Q\/(z+ 1)Q \u223c= (z+ 1)Q via multiplication by z + 1. Now P is\na p-group and (z + 1)Q is free over kP . Therefore\n|P | \u00b7Dim ((\u2211\nx\u2208P\nx ) \u00b7 (z + 1)Q) = Dim((z + 1)Q) .\nSince\n\u2211\nu\u2208P u = (\n\u2211\nx\u2208P x)(z + 1), it follows that\n|P |Dim ((\u2211\nu\u2208P\nu ) \u00b7Q) = 2|P |Dim ((\u2211\nx\u2208P\nx ) \u00b7 (z + 1)Q) = 2 Dim((z + 1)Q) = Dim(Q) .\nThis implies that Q is a free kP -module, because P is a p-group and\n\u2211\nu\u2208P u annihilates every\nnon-projective indecomposable kP -module.\nNow the projectivity of Q implies that W \u223c= K \u2295Q. Because W is a subquotient of M and Q\nis an injective module, Q must be isomorphic to a direct summand of M (as kG-modules). \u0003\nUsing the construction of Proposition 4.2 we now show the existence of exotic endotrivial mod-\nules. Later in this section (in the proof of Theorem 4.5), we see that, with some additional\nargument, the hypothesis on the centrality of z can be removed from the next theorem.\nTheorem 4.3. Let G be a group with a quaternion Sylow 2-subgroup P . Assume that the unique\ninvolution z \u2208 P is central in G. Then we have the following.\n(1) There exist exotic endotrivial kG-modules, that is, indecomposable endotrivial kG-modules\nwhose dimension is congruent to |P |\/2 + 1 modulo |P |.\n(2) More precisely, for i = 1, 2, there exists an exotic endotrivial kG-module Wi such that\n(z\u2212 1)Wi \u223c= Li (as kG-modules), where L1 and L2 are the two kG-modules constructed in\nProposition 3.4.\nProof. Let M = \u21262(k) and note that\nM\u2193G\u3008z\u3009 \u223c= \u21262(k\u3008z\u3009)\u2295 (proj) \u223c= k \u2295 (proj) .\nRecall that (z\u22121)M \u223c= L1\u2295L2, as in Proposition 3.4, and apply Proposition 4.2 to Li, for i = 1, 2.\nThere exists a kG-module Wi such that Wi\u2193G\u3008z\u3009 \u223c= k \u2295 (proj) and (z \u2212 1)Wi \u223c= Li. The restriction\nWi \u2193G\u3008z\u3009 is an endotrivial module, because it is the direct sum of a trivial module and a free\nmodule. Since \u3008z\u3009 is the only nontrivial elementary abelian 2-subgroup of G, we must have that\nWi is an endotrivial module (by Lemma 2.2). If Wi had a nontrivial projective direct summand,\nthen (z \u2212 1)Wi \u223c= Li would have a nontrivial projective direct summand as a kG-module, hence\nENDOTRIVIAL MODULES 11\n(z \u2212 1)M too. But then M = \u21262(k) itself would have a nontrivial projective direct summand, by\nProposition 4.2. This is impossible and it follows that Wi is indecomposable. Finally, since Dim(Li)\nis congruent to |P |\/4 modulo |P |\/2 (see Proposition 3.4) and since Dim(Wi) = 2 Dim(Li) + 1, we\nsee that Dim(Wi) is congruent to |P |\/2 + 1 modulo |P |. Hence Wi is exotic. \u0003\nThe proof provides two non-isomorphic exotic kG-modules W1 and W2, but note that there\nare many other possible exotic modules, because if W is exotic and A is one-dimensional, then\nobviously A\u2297W is again exotic.\nRemark 4.4. By Remark 3.3, one needs cubic roots of unity for the existence of exotic endotrivial\nmodules in the case where P has order 8.\nThe preceding discussion now implies the following theorem.\nTheorem 4.5. Suppose that G is a finite group with a quaternion Sylow 2-subgroup P and let\nH = CG(z), where z is the unique involution of P .\n(1) The restriction map ResGP : T (G) \u2212\u2192 T (P ) is surjective.\n(2) Let X\u02c6(G) denote the subgroup of T (G) generated by the classes of the Green correspondents\nof the 1-dimensional kH-modules. Then we have a split short exact sequence\n0 \/\/ X\u02c6(G) \/\/ T (G)\nResGP \/\/ T (P ) \/\/ 0.\n(3) X\u02c6(G) \u223c= X(H).\nProof. First suppose that z is central in G. By Theorem 2.4, the group T (P ) is generated by the\nclasses of \u2126(kP ) and of an exotic endotrivial kP -module U . Clearly, the class of \u2126(kG) restricts to\nthe class of \u2126(kP ). An exotic endotrivial kG-module W (which exists by Theorem 4.3) restricts\nto an endotrivial kP -module whose dimension is congruent to |P |\/2 + 1 modulo |P |. The unique\nindecomposable non-projective (and endotrivial) summand (W \u2193GP )\u0005 of W \u2193GP must also have\ndimension congruent to |P |\/2 + 1 modulo |P | and is therefore exotic. It follows that (W \u2193GP )\u0005\nis isomorphic to one of the two exotic kP -modules U or \u21262(U) (and actually Dim((W \u2193GP )\u0005) =\n|P |\/2 + 1 by Remark 2.6). As a consequence, the image of the restriction map T (G) \u2192 T (P )\nincludes a set of generators of T (P ) and hence the map is surjective in this case.\nFor the general case, when z is not central, we provide two different proofs. Each has its own\ninterest and advantages. Let H = CG(z) and let W be an exotic endotrivial kH-module. By\nLemma 4.1, there is an indecomposable endotrivial kG-module V such that V \u2193GH \u223c= W \u2295 (proj).\nThen Dim(V ) is congruent to Dim(W ) modulo |P |, so V is exotic. For the other proof, we\nuse the Brauer-Suzuki Theorem [4] which tells us that G\/O2\u2032(G) has a central involution. In\naddition, O2\u2032(G) acts trivially on \u21262(k) and on every module in the principal block. Therefore our\nconstructions show that there is an exotic endotrivial k[G\/O2\u2032(G)]-module, which can be viewed\nas a kG-module by inflation. This is still endotrivial, as we see from the definition and the fact\nthat the inflation of a projective module remains projective. This proves part (1).\nFrom (1), we have an exact sequence\n0 \/\/ X(H) \/\/ T (H)\nResHP \/\/ T (P ) \/\/ 0\n12 JON F. CARLSON \u2217, NADIA MAZZA, AND JACQUES THE\u00b4VENAZ\nwhich splits because T (P ) is a 2-group (of order 8) andX(H) has odd order. Using the isomorphism\nof Lemma 4.1, we obtain T (G) \u223c= T (H) \u223c= X\u02c6(G) \u2295 T (P ). That is, X\u02c6(G) is the inverse image of\nX(H) under the restriction isomorphism. This proves (2) and (3). \u0003\nIn Theorem 4.5, the splitting of the exact sequence exists and is unique. Our next goal is\nto give an explicit description of this splitting, by using the additional information provided by\nProposition 3.5. The group T (P ) is generated by the classes of \u2126(kP ) and U , where U is an exotic\nkP -module. The splitting of ResHP : T (H) \u2212\u2192 T (P ) must lift each of these two generators to an\nelement of T (H) of the same order.\nProposition 4.6. The image of the unique splitting of ResHP : T (H) \u2212\u2192 T (P ) is generated by the\nclasses of \u2126(kH) (of order 4) and one of the two modules W1,W2 constructed in Theorem 4.3 (of\norder 2, that is, self-dual). Moreover, \u21262(W1) \u223c= W2.\nProof. It is clear that \u2126(kP ) lifts to \u2126(kH), and this still has order 4 by Proposition 3.5. Now\neach of the two exotic kP -modules is self-dual (that is, its class in T (P ) has order 2). We know\nthat the two exotic kH-modules W1 and W2 constructed in Theorem 4.3 restrict to the two exotic\nkP -modules. So we only have to prove that W is self-dual, where W = W1 or W = W2. If\nResHP [W ] = [U ], then both [W ] and its dual [W\n\u2217] restrict to [U ], because U is self-dual. Since the\nkernel of ResHP is the group of linear characters of H, there is a one-dimensional kH-module A\nwith the property that W \u2217 \u223c= A \u2297W . Tracking the construction of W , we note that W has a\nfiltration with 3 successive quotients\n( W , K , W )\nwhere W = (z \u2212 1)W and the middle module K = W0\/(z \u2212 1)W is one-dimensional. Now the\nconstruction of W comes from the kH-module M = \u21262(kH) which has a similar filtration. The\nconstruction of W shows that its middle module K is isomorphic to the middle one-dimensional\nmodule M0\/(z\u22121)M (see the proof of Proposition 4.2). But M0\/(z\u22121)M is the trivial module by\nProposition 3.5, so K is the trivial module. It follows that A\u2297W has a filtration with 3 successive\nquotients\n( A\u2297W , A , A\u2297W ) .\nOn the other hand, W \u2217 has a filtration with 3 successive quotients\n( W\n\u2217\n, K , W\n\u2217\n) .\nThis implies that A \u223c= K is the trivial module, so W \u2217 \u223c= A\u2297W \u223c= W .\nTo prove that \u21262(W1) \u223c= W2, we observe that, since the order of X(H) is odd, there are exactly\nthree elements of order 2 in T (H), namely the classes of \u21262(k), W1 and W2. This forces the\nequality [\u21262(k)] + [W1] = [W2] in T (H), that is, [\u21262(W1)] = [\u21262(k) \u2297W1] = [W2]. Since both\nkH-modules \u21262(W1) and W2 are indecomposable, they must be isomorphic. \u0003\n5. Uniserial endotrivial modules\nIn this section we prove the existence of uniserial endotrivial modules of dimension congruent\nto \u00b11 (mod |P |\/2) for any finite group G with a quaternion Sylow 2-subgroup P . More precisely,\nif W1,W2 are the two exotic modules constructed in Theorem 4.3, then either Wi is uniserial or\n\u2126(Wi) is uniserial (or both) for i = 1, 2. Recall that W2 \u223c= \u21262(W1). The method is a direct\napplication of the techniques used in Proposition 3.4 and Theorem 4.3, alongside an inspection of\nthe results in [19] in the six cases where the given basic algebra may arise as the principal block of\nENDOTRIVIAL MODULES 13\na group algebra. We use Erdmann\u2019s notation in [19, p. 303-305] and also the usual diagrammatic\nrepresentations of modules (see e.g. [17]). As before, if we say that a module has composition factors\n(A,B,C, . . . ), we read these from head to socle of the module. Now, recall that the diagram for\n\u21262(k) has the form\n\u21262(k) : N1\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\nN2\n~~\n~~\n~~\n~~\nk\n~~\n~~\n~~\n~~\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\nL1 L2\nso that W1 : N1\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\nk\n~~\n~~\n~~\n~~\nL1\nand W2 : N2\n~~\n~~\n~~\n~~\nk\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\nL2\nwhere Ni \u223c= Li is uniserial, for i = 1, 2. An edge is dotted to mean that there may or may not be a\nnontrivial extension between the modules. This determines which of the modules W1,W2, or their\nrespective syzygies is uniserial. Indeed, one fact that follows the explicit computations is that if\nan exotic module is not uniserial, then its syzygy is uniserial. We also remark that if an exotic\nmodule is uniserial, then its syzygy may also be uniserial.\nThe principal 2-block of a group with quaternion Sylow 2-subgroup can have one, two or three\nsimple modules. We analyze these cases by subcases according to the results of [19].\n5.1. One simple module. The simple module must be the trivial module k. In particular, this\nsituation occurs when G = P is quaternion. In this case, the construction yields that any exotic\nendotrivial module Wi is not uniserial and has composition length |P |\/2 + 1, whereas its syzygy\n\u2126(Wi) is uniserial and has composition length |P |\/2\u2212 1 for i = 1, 2. In addition, the modules Ni\nare both uniserial of composition length |P |\/4 for i = 1, 2.\n5.2. Two simple modules. There are two possibilities. Write k and S for the two non-isomorphic\nsimple modules. Note that both are self-dual. According to [16, (6.8)], such an algebra occurs as\nprincipal block of a finite group G having a subgroup isomorphic to SL2(q) of index 2. The case\n(i) is when q \u2261 1 (mod 4) and (ii) when q \u2261 3 (mod 4).\n(i) For the type Q(2A), exactly one exotic module W is uniserial of length 3, with compo-\nsition factors (S, k, S), and \u21263(W ) is also uniserial. Indeed, we have N1 = S and N2\nhas length 3|P |\/8, with composition factors (k, S, k, k, S, k, . . . , S, k). Moreover, there\nis a nontrivial extension between the socle of N2 and the head of L2, implying that\n\u21262(W ) is not uniserial. We obtain that \u21263(W ) is uniserial with composition factors\n(S, k, k, S, k, . . . , k, S, k) and length 3|P |\/4\u2212 1.\n(ii) For the type Q(2B)1, no exotic module is uniserial. Both syzygies of the exotic modules\nare uniserial of length 3|P |\/4 \u2212 1, with composition factors (k, S, S, k, S, S, . . . , k, S) and\n(S, k, S, S, k, S, . . . , S, k). Explicitly, we get that the modules Ni have composition length\n|P |\/4 and 3|P |\/8 with composition factors (S, S, . . . , S) and (k, S, k, k, S, k, . . . , S, k).\n5.3. Three simple modules. There are three possibilities, giving rise to the well known examples.\nWrite k, S, T for the three simple modules.\n(i) For the type Q(3A)2, which occurs as the principal block of SL2(q) for q \u2261 1 (mod 4), both\nexotic modules are uniserial of length 3, with composition factors (S, k, S) and (T, k, T ).\nIn particular, the modules Ni are simple and all the simple modules are self-dual.\n14 JON F. CARLSON \u2217, NADIA MAZZA, AND JACQUES THE\u00b4VENAZ\n(ii) For the type Q(3K), which occurs as the principal block of SL2(q) for q \u2261 3 (mod 4), none\nof the exotic modules is uniserial. Instead, their syzygies are uniserial and both have length\n3, with composition factors (S, k, S) and (T, k, T ). Moreover, the modules Ni have length\n|P |\/4 and composition factors (S, T, . . . , S, T ) and (T, S, . . . , T, S). In this case S\u2217 \u223c= T .\n(iii) For the type Q(3B), which occurs as the principal block of the double cover of A7 (with\n|P | = 16), one exotic endotrivial module is uniserial of length 3 and composition factors\n(S, k, S), whereas the other exotic endotrivial module is not uniserial, but its syzygy is and\nhas composition factors (S, k, T, k, S, k, T ). We observe that in this situation, each exotic\nmodule and its syzygy has composition length independent of the size of P .\nWe end with a remark on the dimensions of the uniserial endotrivial modules in the case of the\ngroups SL2(q). It is known that the two non trivial simple modules have dimension q\u221212 . Since\neach uniserial endotrivial module in Section 5.3 (i) and (ii) has composition series (S, k, S), where\nS is a nontrivial simple module, we have the following.\nProposition 5.1. Let G = SL2(q), with q an odd prime power. Write P for a Sylow 2-subgroup of\nG. Then, there exist two non-isomorphic uniserial endotrivial modules of dimension q and length 3.\nMore precisely, these modules are exotic (and self-dual) if and only if q \u2261 1 (mod 4). For q \u2261 3\n(mod 4), their syzygies are the two exotic modules and have dimension 1 + (q \u2212 1)|P |\/8.\n6. Groups with semi-dihedral Sylow 2-subgroup\nSuppose that G is a finite group with a semi-dihedral Sylow 2-subgroup P . Our main aim in this\nsection is to show that the restriction map ResGP : T (G) \u2212\u2192 T (P ) is split surjective. We continue\nto assume that k is an algebraically closed field of characteristic 2. We first discuss the general\nstructure of T (G).\nProposition 6.1. Let G be a finite group with a semi-dihedral Sylow 2-subgroup P . Write K(G)\nfor the kernel of the restriction map ResGP : T (G) \u2212\u2192 T (P ).\n(1) K(G) is a finite group of odd order, isomorphic to a subgroup of the group X(N) of one-\ndimensional representations of N , where N = NG(P ).\n(2) T (G) \u223c= K(G)\u2295 Im(ResGP ).\nProof. By [7, Proposition 2.6], the restriction map ResGN : T (G) \u2212\u2192 T (N) is injective. Now N has\na nontrivial normal 2-subgroup and therefore, by [21, Lemma 2.6], there is an exact sequence\n0 \/\/ X(N) \/\/ T (N)\nResNP \/\/ T (P )\nwhere X(N) denotes the subgroup of T (N) consisting of the classes of all one-dimensional kN -\nmodules. Clearly X(N) is isomorphic to Hom(N, k\u2217), and hence it is also isomorphic to the 2\u2032-part\nof the abelianization of N . It follows that K(G) is the inverse image under ResGN of the odd order\ngroup X(N). Since T (P ) \u223c= Z\/2Z\u2295 Z, the map ResGP splits and T (G) \u223c= K(G)\u2295 Im(ResGP ). \u0003\nSo we are left with the question of the surjectivity of ResGP : T (G) \u2212\u2192 T (P ). We use in\nan essential way the stable Auslander-Reiten quiver of kG, in particular the work of Webb [23]\nand Erdmann [19, 17, 18]. For any subgroup S of G, we denote by \u2206S the component of the\nstable Auslander-Reiten quiver of kS containing the module \u2126(kS). An AR-sequence stands for\nan Auslander-Reiten sequence (or almost split sequence). We first state the results we need.\nENDOTRIVIAL MODULES 15\nProposition 6.2. Let G be a group with a semi-dihedral Sylow 2-subgroup P and let N = NG(P ).\n(1) The Green correspondence induces an isomorphism \u2206G \u223c= \u2206N .\n(2) N \u223c= P \u00d7X where X is a group of odd order. Restriction induces an isomorphism \u2206N \u223c=\n\u2206P , with inverse induced by inflation from P \u223c= N\/X to N .\n(3) \u2206P is a component of type ZD\u221e and \u2126\u22121(kP ) lies at the end of \u2206P , with one predecessor.\n(4) Let Rk be the projective cover of the trivial module k and let the heart of Rk be the module\nHk = Rad(Rk)\/ Soc(Rk). There is an AR-sequence\nS : 0 \/\/ \u2126(k) \/\/ Hk \u2295Rk \/\/ \u2126\u22121(k) \/\/ 0 .\n(5) All modules in \u2206G have P as a vertex.\n(6) Any AR-sequence terminating in a module in \u2206G splits on restriction to a proper subgroup\nof its vertex P .\nProof. (1) This is proved in Theorem D of [23].\n(2) It is well-known that Aut(P ) is a 2-group. Actually the proof given in [20, Lemma 7.7.2 (vi)]\nfor the automorphism group of a dihedral 2-group carries over verbatim for a semi-dihedral 2-group.\nIt follows that N = PCG(P ) and therefore N = P \u00d7X, where X is a group of odd order. Thus\nX is in the kernel of the principal block of kN and acts trivially on all modules in \u2206N . Therefore\nrestriction induces an isomorphism \u2206N \u223c= \u2206P and inflation induces the inverse isomorphism.\n(3) Shifting by the Heller translate \u2126 induces an isomorphism between \u2206P and the component\nof the stable Auslander-Reiten quiver of kP containing the trivial module k. By [17, Lemma 7.1]\nor [19, Proposition II.10.1]), the latter is of type ZD\u221e and k lies at the end of the component,\nwith one predecessor.\n(4) This is well-known (e.g. [23, Section 4] or [3, Proposition 4.12.7]).\n(5) This is Theorem C of [23].\n(6) This is well-known (e.g. [23, Lemma 3.1] or [3, Proposition 4.12.10]). \u0003\nThe presence of a tree class D\u221e is an exceptional case which only occurs in the semi-dihedral\nsituation. (Note that this case was missing in [23, Proposition 5.6].) Moreover, Proposition 6.2\nhas the following consequence, already used in [17, (2.3)] and in [23, Proposition 5.6].\nCorollary 6.3. Let G be a group with a semi-dihedral Sylow 2-subgroup P . Let Rk be the projective\ncover of the trivial module k and let Hk = Rad(Rk)\/ Soc(Rk) be the heart of Rk. Then there is an\nAR-sequence of the form\nE : 0 \/\/ V \/\/ Hk \u2295R \/\/ U \/\/ 0\nwhere V and U are indecomposable modules in \u2206G, U is not isomorphic to \u2126\u22121(k), and R is a\nprojective kG-module. Moreover V \u2217 \u223c= U .\nProof. By Webb\u2019s theorem [23, Theorem E], the heart Hk of Rk is indecomposable. In view of\nthe AR-sequence S, we see that Hk is the only predecessor of \u2126\u22121(k) in \u2206G. Since \u2206G is of type\nZD\u221e by Proposition 6.2, Hk must appear in the middle of another AR-sequence of the form E ,\nwhere U is not isomorphic to \u2126\u22121(k) and R is some projective module.\nSince Hk is self-dual, the dual of E is an AR-sequence with Hk in the middle. Since the other\nAR-sequence S is self-dual, the dual of E must be isomorphic to itself and hence V \u2217 \u223c= U . \u0003\n16 JON F. CARLSON \u2217, NADIA MAZZA, AND JACQUES THE\u00b4VENAZ\nCorollary 6.3 is sufficient for our construction of exotic endotrivial modules, but we shall see at\nthe end that much more can be proved about the AR-sequence E . The use of Corollary 6.3 in the\nanalysis of endotrivial modules is as follows.\nTheorem 6.4. Let G be a group with a semi-dihedral Sylow 2-subgroup P .\n(1) The modules V and U in Corollary 6.3 are endotrivial modules.\n(2) The endotrivial module \u2126(U) is exotic and self-dual. In other words, its class [\u2126(U)] has\norder 2 in T (G).\n(3) The restriction map ResGP : T (G) \u2212\u2192 T (P ) is surjective and split.\nProof. Consider the AR-sequence\nS : 0 \/\/ \u2126(k) \/\/ Hk \u2295Rk \/\/ \u2126\u22121(k) \/\/ 0\nof Proposition 6.2. Let Q be the unique maximal dihedral subgroup of P . Observe that Q contains\nall the elements of order 2 in P . As a consequence, a kG-module is projective if and only if it\nis projective on restriction to Q (see Theorem 2.7(2)). By Proposition 6.2, the above sequence S\nsplits on restriction to Q. Since \u2126(k)\u2193GQ \u223c= \u2126(kQ)\u2295 (proj) and similarly for \u2126\u22121(k), we deduce that\nHk\u2193GQ \u223c= \u2126(kQ)\u2295 \u2126\u22121(kQ)\u2295 (proj) .\nNow the other AR-sequence\nE : 0 \/\/ V \/\/ Hk \u2295R \/\/ U \/\/ 0\nof Corollary 6.3 also splits on restriction to Q, again by Proposition 6.2, using the fact that all the\nmodules in the AR-component \u2206G have vertex P . Thus we obtain a sequence\nE\u2193GQ : 0 \/\/ V \u2193GQ \/\/ \u2126(kQ)\u2295 \u2126\u22121(kQ)\u2295 (proj) \/\/ U\u2193GQ \/\/ 0 .\nNow V \u2193GQ cannot be projective, otherwise V would be projective, and similarly for U\u2193GQ . Conse-\nquently, U and V have the property that\nU\u2193GQ \u223c= \u2126\u03b5(kQ)\u2295 (proj) and V \u2193GQ \u223c= \u2126\u2212\u03b5(kQ)\u2295 (proj)\nfor \u03b5 = \u00b11 and for some projective modules. Note that, since Q contains all the elements of order 2\nin P , the restrictions of U and V to any elementary abelian 2-subgroup are endotrivial modules.\nTherefore U and V are endotrivial modules by Lemma 2.2, proving (1).\n(2) Since E is an AR-sequence, V \u223c= \u21262(U). On the other hand V \u223c= U\u2217 by Corollary 6.3.\nTherefore\n\u2126(U)\u2217 \u223c= \u2126\u22121(U\u2217) \u223c= \u2126\u22121(V ) \u223c= \u2126\u22121(\u21262(U)) \u223c= \u2126(U) .\nIt follows that the class [\u2126(U)] has order 2 in T (G) (for it cannot be of order 1 because U 6\u223c= \u2126\u22121(k)).\nSince the kernel K(G) of ResGP has odd order by Proposition 6.1, Res\nG\nP ([\u2126(U)]) has order 2 in\nT (P ) \u223c= Z\/2Z \u2295 Z. Thus ResGP ([\u2126(U)]) is the class of the unique indecomposable endotrivial kP -\nmodule that is both self-dual and exotic. So the dimension of \u2126(U) is congruent to |P |\/2 + 1\nmodulo |P |, and we have that \u2126(U) must be exotic.\n(3) By (2), the summand Z\/2Z of T (P ) \u223c= Z\/2Z \u2295 Z is in the image of ResGP . Clearly\nResGP [\u2126(kG)] = [\u2126(kP )], which generates the summand Z. Thus Res\nG\nP is surjective. There is\nan obvious splitting whose image is generated by [\u2126(kG)] and [\u2126(U)]. \u0003\nENDOTRIVIAL MODULES 17\nCorollary 6.5. Let G be a finite group with a semi-dihedral Sylow 2-subgroup P . Write K(G)\nfor the kernel of the restriction map ResGP : T (G) \u2212\u2192 T (P ). Then T (G) \u223c= K(G) \u2295 T (P ). In\nparticular, if P is selfnormalizing, then T (G) \u223c= T (P ). \u0003\nThe only difference with the quaternion case, which prevents us from concluding as before with\nthe identification of K(G), is that the centralizer in G of the central involution z of P is not\nstrongly 2-embedded in general. So the restriction map ResGCG(z) : T (G) \u2212\u2192 T (CG(z)) may not\nbe an isomorphism (even though it is injective by [7, Proposition 2.6]).\nAs announced before, we conclude with some additional information about the AR-sequence E\nof Corollary 6.3. Most of the hard work for the proof has been done by K. Erdmann [19, 17, 18].\nProposition 6.6. Let G be a group with a semi-dihedral Sylow 2-subgroup P . In the AR-sequence\nE of Corollary 6.3, the projective module R is zero. Moreover V and U are uniserial modules.\nProof. By [1, Proposition 4.11], an AR-sequence with a nonzero projective summand R in the\nmiddle must be the standard AR-sequence ending in \u2126\u22121(T ), where T is a simple module. So\nif R 6= 0, we must have R = RT where RT is the projective cover of T and the heart HT =\nRad(RT )\/ Soc(RT ) is isomorphic to Hk. Note that T is nontrivial because the sequence E is not\nisomorphic to the sequence S.\nNow we claim that there is no nontrivial simple module T such that HT \u223c= Hk. This follows\nfrom an inspection of Erdmann\u2019s lists in [17, 18]. By Olsson\u2019s results [22], the principal block of\nthe group algebra kG has either 1, 2, or 3 simple modules. There is nothing to prove if there is\nonly one simple module. If there are two simple modules, then the family V does not occur as a\nblock of a group algebra (by [17, Lemma 8.16]) and we see that in families I-IV the hearts of the\ntwo projective modules are not isomorphic. Similarly, if there are three simple modules, then the\nfamily VII does not occur as a block of a group algebra (by [18, Lemma 11.14]) and we see that in\nall the other families the hearts of any two projective modules are not isomorphic.\nIt follows now that R = 0. The fact that V and U are uniserial follows from a direct inspection\nof the hearts, for all self-dual projective modules appearing in Erdmann\u2019s lists. \u0003\nRemark 6.7. As noted already in [19, 18], an algebra of semi-dihedral type with three simple\nmodules may occur as block algebra if it belongs to any family of type I-IV, whereas V-VIII are\nknown to be non-examples of blocks. In Erdmann\u2019s paper, case IX is left open. Following a\nprivate communication with K. Erdmann, it turns out that an algebra in family IX is not a block\nalgebra. Indeed, in the notation of [18], we have that n \u2265 4, and since P1 is the unique self-dual\nindecomposable projective module in the list, we would have S1 = k. This would give an AR-\nsequence E , with V and U uniserial. By taking the dual of the sequence, we get that U\u2217 \u223c= V . So\nthe two other simple modules S0 and S2 must be dual to each other. Counting the multiplicities of\neach simple in V and in U yields the equation s = k, with s = 2 and k = 2n\u22122, which is impossible\nfor any n \u2265 4.\nAcknowledgements.
