Box 2177, Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania  \n \nSUMMARY \n \nOver an eight year period, harvesting methods based on simple mechanical aids (blade and \nshear) were evaluated against hand harvesting on mature morphologically-contrasting tea \nclones in Southern Tanzania.  The effects of shear step height (5 - 32 mm) and the harvest \ninterval (1.8 - 4.2 phyllochrons) were also examined.  Except in the year following \npruning, large annual yields (5.7 \u2013 7.9 t dry tea ha-1) were obtained by hand harvesting at \nintervals of two phyllochrons.  For clones K35 (large shoots) and T207 (small shoots), the \nmean harvested shoot weights were equivalent to three unfurled leaves and a terminal bud.  \nThe proportions of broken shoots (40 \u2013 48 %) and coarse material (4 - 6%) were relatively \nhigh.  Using a blade, instead of hand-harvesting, resulted in similar yields from K35 but \nheavier yields from T207 (+13 %).  The increase with small-leaved clone T207 was \nassociated with the harvest of more shoots and heavier shoots, smaller increases in canopy \nheight, and a higher proportion (7 \u2013 9 %) of coarse material compared to hand-harvesting.  \nOn bushes, which had been harvested by hand for two years following pruning, using flat \nshears (no step) supported on the tea canopy resulted, over a three year period, in yields 8 - \n14 % less than those obtained by hand harvesting and, for clone K35, a reduction in the \nleaf area index to below 5.  The development of a higher leaf area index is possible by \nadding a step to the shear.  However, since annual yields were reduced by 40 - 50 kg ha-1 \nper mm increase in step height, the step should be the minimum necessary to maintain \nlong-term bush health.  As mean shoot weights following shear harvesting were about 13 \n% below those obtained by hand harvesting, there is scope, when using shears, to extend \nthe harvest interval from 2 to 2.5 phyllochrons. \n \nCurrent addresses:  \n3 Crop and Water Management Systems (Intnl) Ltd, Pear Tree Cottage, Frog Lane, Ilmington, \nShipston-on-Stour, Warwickshire, CV36 4LG, UK \n4 South Africa Sugarcane Research Institute, Private Bag X02, Mt Edgecombe 4300, South Africa \n5 Booker-Tate Ltd, Masters Court, Church Road, Thame, Oxon, OX9 3FA \n6 Corresponding author: P.Burgess@cranfield.ac.uk \n   \n                                                 \n \n  \n2\nINTRODUCTION \nThe tea beverage is derived from young shoots harvested frequently during the growing \nseason from tea (Camellia sinensis) bushes.  The frequency of harvest depends primarily \non the temperature, the incidence of drought, and the shoot standard (number of unfurled \nleaves per shoot) as specified by the processor for an identified market.  Traditionally, in \nmost developing countries, harvesters (often locally known as \u201cpluckers\u201d) remove the \nshoots (typically two or three unfurled leaves and the unopened terminal bud) by hand.  \nThis can be a selective and skilful process involving between 140 and 190 individual hand \nactions per minute (Evans, 1993).  In Southern Tanzania, pluckers typically remove \nbetween 4 and 9 kg of fresh shoots per hour depending on peaks and troughs in production \n(Squirrell, 1995).  This represents 1700-5000 person hours ha-1 for a crop with an annual \nyield of 15-20 t ha-1 of fresh shoots.  Labour on commercial estates, although cheap in \nabsolute terms, currently represents 40\u201345 % of the total field costs when the provision of \nhousing and other social benefits are included.  If the tea industry in Southern Tanzania is \nto remain commercially viable, it must maintain competitive costs of production against \nthe background of a long-term decline in world tea prices.   \nIn some areas, there is also a shortage of men and women willing to undertake this \nrepetitive work on a continuing and reliable basis.  Strategically, there is also the need to \nplan for a declining workforce because of the high incidence of HIV\/Aids in many of the \ntea producing regions of Africa.  For smallholders in Tanzania, with average tea areas of \n0.3-0.5 ha, there can also be a shortage of family and hired labour at critical times when \npeaks of production, for example after the start of the rains, coincide with other labour \nintensive activities such as the weeding of maize and other food crops.  \nIt is for these reasons that producers are actively seeking alternative, but appropriate, \nways for improving the productivity of tea harvesting.  The choice is wide, from simple \nmechanical hand-held aids like shears and a blade, described in this paper, through \nmotorised cutter bars (which may be hand held, pushed on wheels, or self-propelled), to \nlarge-scale machines harvesting two or three rows of tea at a time (Willson, 1992).  \nSelection of the appropriate system depends on social, financial, technical, and \nenvironmental factors such as the availability and skills of labour, the capital investment \nand running costs, the supporting infrastructure for machine maintenance, and the terrain.  \nTechniques developed under one set of conditions will not necessarily work successfully \nelsewhere.  In Tanzania, except immediately after pruning, tea is typically harvested at \nintervals of 10-30 days representing 19-30 individual harvests per year.  One machine \ncould, in theory, be operating for five or six days per week for up to 250 days annually.  \nBy contrast machines developed and used in Japan on small (0.5 ha) family farms may \nonly operate for five or six days a year due, in part, to the seasonal climate.  Hence, it is \nnot surprising that such machines may perform poorly in Africa. \nAs well as influencing the yield and quality characteristics of the harvested crop, the \nmethod of shoot removal can affect the number, size and type of shoots remaining on the \nbush.  For example where tea is grown at relatively high temperatures in Malawi and \nAssam, plucking immature shoots can limit yields (Tanton; 1979; Manivel and Hussain, \n1986) and some form of selectivity, as practised by skilled pluckers, is important for bush \nproductivity.  It can also affect the quality of the harvested crop, which can be defined in \nvarious ways.  At the tea factory gate, the harvested shoots are often judged on the basis of \nthe composition of a sample of shoots, including shoot size distribution and the proportion \nof broken shoots and coarse material.  After manufacture the processed tea leaves and \nresultant tea liquor are judged and valued, depending on the market, by sensory \ncharacteristics such as colour, brightness, briskness and flavour. \n  \n3\nEvaluating the effectiveness of different tea mechanical harvesting systems therefore \nrequires several parameters to be assessed.  These include yield, the composition of the \nharvested shoots, the value of the processed tea, the frequency and intensity of harvesting \nin relation to stages of bush and shoot development, long-term effects on the vigour \n(productivity) of a bush, ease of use including height control, maintenance, labour \nproductivity, and economics.  To complicate matters further, vegetatively propagated \ncultivars of tea, usually known as clones, can differ in the morphological characteristics of \nthe shoots.  This in turn may influence their suitability for mechanical harvesting. \nThis paper reports the results of a series of experiments conducted in Southern \nTanzania over an eight-year period which were designed to evaluate the effectiveness, \nrelative to hand harvesting, of simple mechanical aids (blades from Kenya, and shears \nfrom South India), and to specify how best they could be adapted and successfully used \nwith tea clones having contrasting morphological characteristics. \n \nMETHODOLOGY \nThe experiments were all sited in areas of mature tea at the Ngwazi Tea Research \nStation (8\u00ba32\u00b4 S, 35\u00ba10\u00b4E, altitude 1840 m asl) in the Mufindi District of Southern \nTanzania.  Burgess and Carr (1996a) have presented full details of the site and its seasonal \nclimate. \nThere were three related experiments: experiment 1 was primarily designed to \ncompare the effects of three harvesting methods (hand, blade and shears) on the \nproductivity of two clones with different size shoots.  The first phase (experiment 1a) \ncovered a three-year period (1992 - 1995); the second phase (experiment 1b) lasted four \nyears (1996-2000).  Experiment 2 examined the effects of harvesting frequency using \nshears for one year (1994) only, whilst experiment 3 compared three  harvesting intervals \nand three harvesting methods over a four-year period (1996-2000). \n \nHarvesting methods \nIn all the hand harvesting treatments, the \u2018pluckers\u2019 (men and women) were instructed \nto remove all shoots with two or more unfurled leaves, including soft dormant shoots, \nprotruding above the level surface of the bush.     \nThe blade harvesting technique was developed in Kenya by Brooke Bond Kenya Ltd \n(J. Rono, personal communication; 1992). The blade consists of a blunt knife, made from \ngalvanised steel, positioned 15 mm above a horizontal aluminium platform or base plate \n(Fig. 1).  The blade is held in one hand so that the platform rests on the bush surface.  The \nblade is then moved towards the operator, who uses the other hand to guide shoots into the \npath of the knife, where they are broken.  To minimise the observed adverse effects of the \nblade \u2018digging\u2019 into the canopy, the platform, which measured 100 mm x 150 mm for \nexperiment 1a, was enlarged to 100 mm x 250 mm for experiments 1b and 3.    \nThe shear harvesting system is based on ordinary garden shears with the following \nmodifications: a tray is attached to the lower blade for collecting the harvested shoots and \nthe upper blade supports a plate which pushes the cut shoots into the tray (Fig. 2).  The \nbase of the tray rests on the top of the crop canopy.  The height at which the shoots are cut, \nrelative to the effective surface of the canopy, is a measure of the intensity of harvesting.  \nWith shears this can be changed by varying the space (or step) between the base of the tray \nand the top of the lower blade (Suryanarayanan and Hegde, 1993).  In turn this controls the \nrate of increase in height of the crop canopy above the ground. \n \n \n  \n4\n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 1.  The blade. \nTo assess the effects of the intensity of harvesting, three step heights were compared in \nexperiment 1a: 5, 22, and 32 mm.  The '5-mm step' treatment was in effect the minimum \nstep height being the sum of the thickness of the lower blade and the tray.  In January \n1993, a small levelling plate was added to the upper blade to improve height control on the \n22 and 32 mm step shears (Fig. 2).  In experiment 1b, the levelling plates were removed \nand the step heights were modified to 5, 14, and 22 mm.  In experiment 2, shears with a \nstep height of 22 mm with a levelling plate were used in all the harvesting treatments.  A \n5-mm step (flat) shear was used in experiment 3. \nAfter 1994, to overcome any bias resulting from the relative ability of people to \nharvest tea using the different techniques, everyone involved was trained in all of the \nharvesting methods.  Individuals were then allocated at random to each treatment at each \nharvest event. \n \n150-250 mm \nThe left hand guides \nshoots into the path of \nthe blade \nMovement \nof blade \n  \n5\n \n \nFig. 2.  The step shear including a levelling plate. \nClones \nIn total, four clones, representing a range of shoot and leaf sizes were compared.  \nThese ranged from two large-leafed Assam-type clones called KE BBK35 (from Kenya) \nand TZ BBT282 (from Tanzania) to a small-leafed China-type clone called TZ BBT207 \nalso from Tanzania.  The fourth clone, KE BBK7, was originally selected in Kenya and \nhas intermediate-sized leaves and shoots.  For brevity, in the rest of this paper, these clones \nare referred to as K35, T282, T207, and K7 respectively.  All had been planted in 1971, at \nspacings corresponding to 0.9 m x 1.2 m and harvested by hand until the start of \nexperiment 1a. Whenever the potential soil water deficit reached 80 mm, the site was \nuniformly irrigated with sprinklers during the dry season to bring the soil back to field \ncapacity.  In the year of pruning (1996), following bud break, irrigation was scheduled \nusing pan evaporation adjusted for crop cover.  Fertilizer was applied at an annual rate of \n300 kg N ha-1, as a N:P2O5:K2O 2:1:1 or 2:1:2 compound, in two equal splits.  From April \n1995, zinc was applied at annual rates of between 1.5 and 4.5 kg zinc oxide ha-1.  Prior to \nthe start of experiment 1a in 1992, the experimental area was last pruned in June 1990.  \nThe normal interval between prunings in this part of Tanzania is four years.  \n25 mm \n225 mm \nLevelling \n plate \n200 mm \n  \n6\nHarvesting frequency  \n With the tea crop, a phyllochron (P) can be defined as the time interval (day) between \na terminal bud unfurling its second and third true leaves (Burgess and Carr, 1998).  In \nexperiments 1a and 1b, the shoots were harvested at standard intervals of two phyllochrons \n(2 P), as recommended for hand harvesting in Tanzania, although an extended interval (4 \nP) was also tested.  In experiment 2, the harvest interval was the principal treatment \nranging in equal increments from 1.8 to 4.2 P.  In experiment 3, the intervals were 2, 3 and \n4 P.  At the experimental site, an interval of 2 P corresponds to about 14-18 d during the \nwarm season and up to 30 d during the cool winter months. \nThe seasonal change in a phyllochron, and hence the appropriate harvest interval was \ninitially estimated from the mean air temperature (Tmean; \u00baC) and its relationship with the \nmean leaf appearance rate (1\/P; d-1) of six clones (Equation 1, Burgess and Carr, 1998): \n1\/P = 0.0162 (Tmean \u2013 9.0).  (1) \nAfter September 1993, the duration of a phyllochron was determined from a similar \nrelationship determined specifically for the four clones represented in these experiments \n(Equation 2):   \n1\/P = 0.0156 (Tmean \u2013 9.1) (2) \nAlthough the clones differed in their apparent base temperatures for leaf appearance rate \n(K7: 6.0\u00baC; T282 and K35: 9.3\u00baC; T207: 10.6\u00baC), a common equation was adopted \nbecause logistically it was not possible to harvest individual clones on different days.  \n \nExperimental design \nIn experiment 1a, six harvesting treatments were replicated four times in adjacent \nareas of clones K35 (large shoots) and T207 (small shoots) in a randomised complete \nblock design.  There were 20 bushes in each plot, which were surrounded by single guard \nrows which were harvested in the same way as the 20 bushes.  The treatments compared \nwere hand, blade, and shear (with 5, 22, and 32 mm steps) harvested at 2 P intervals.  The \nsixth treatment comprised the use of the 5-mm step (or flat) shears at an interval of 4 P.  \nThe harvesting treatments were first imposed in July 1992, at the start of the cropping year \nduring the winter, and continued until June 1995 when the bushes were pruned.  The \nresidual effects of the harvesting treatments were then assessed by hand harvesting all the \nplots and recording yields for one year. \nExperiment 1b began in June 1996 when six harvesting treatments, replicated in each \nof four blocks, were again imposed on clones K35 and T207.  The allocation of harvesting \ntreatments to plots was the same as in experiment 1a, except that 14-mm and 22-mm step \nshears were used in the previous 22-mm and 32-mm step shear plots respectively.  Hence \nthe methods compared were hand, blade (with a modified platform), and the shear (at step \nheights of 5, 14 and 22 mm), all at a 2 P interval, and the 5-mm step (flat) shear at a 4 P \ninterval.  The experiment continued for four years until July 2000 when it was pruned. \nIn experiment 2, five harvesting intervals were compared (1.8, 2.4, 3.0, 3.6 and 4.2 P), \nusing the 22-mm step shears, in an area of clone K35 adjacent to experiment 1a and at the \nsame stage in the pruning cycle (years four to five) for 12 months beginning in January \n1994.  There were four replicates of each treatment and the plot sizes and experimental \ndesign were similar to those described for experiments 1a and 1b.  \nIn experiment 3, conducted from June 1996 to May 2000, the effects of three \nharvesting intervals on hand, blade and shear harvesting were examined on blocks of \nclones K7 (intermediate shoot size) and T282 (large shoots) adjacent to experiment 1b.  \nDue to space restrictions, it was only possible to examine two harvest treatments on each \nclone.  For K7, hand harvesting was compared with the blade at three harvest intervals (2, \n  \n7\n3 and 4 P).  For T282, hand harvesting was compared with the flat shear at the same three \nintervals.  There were four replicates of each treatment combination and the experimental \ndesign and plot sizes were identical to those for experiments 1a and 1b. \n \nMeasurements \nAcross the four experiments, measurements were made of the yields of fresh shoots \nand corresponding dry matter contents, the composition of the harvested shoots, and \nindirect measures of plant vigour.  There was an attempt to assess the quality of the \nprocessed tea from experiment 1a, during August and September 1993 at a time when the \nshoots were still growing slowly.  However with this limited dataset, it was not possible to \ndetermine a significant effect of the harvest treatments on the value and character of the \nprocessed tea, and therefore this research is not reported.   \n \nYield: in all the experiments, the fresh weights of shoots removed from individual plots \nwere recorded at each harvest.  In experiments 1a, 1b and 3, representative samples (about \n30 - 70 g) were then taken from individual clones for dry matter determinations from \nwhich the yield of dried tea could be calculated.  The effects of harvesting treatments on \ndry matter contents were small and were ignored.  On days when dry matter contents were \nnot determined, estimates for each clone were made by interpolation.  The values for a \nsingle clone ranged from about 18 % during the rainy season to 30 % during the cool, dry \nweather.   \nIn experiment 2, the mean dry matter content of the harvested shoots in 1994 was \n23.3%, and this value was used to derive the dried tea yields from the fresh weight \nmeasurements.  The yield data were also corrected to allow for differences in the duration \nof the experiment (range 358 to 366 d) depending on the harvest interval.  The total \nnumber of harvests during the year varied from 11 (4.2 P) to 24 (1.8 P).  The \ncorresponding minimum and maximum harvest intervals were 27 and 51 d, and 11 and 26 \nd, respectively. \n \nFresh shoot composition and numbers: samples of shoots (150 - 200 g) were taken for \nanalysis of shoot composition, from each plot at each harvest in three replicates of \nexperiment 1a and from all four replicates in experiment 2.  The samples were separated \ninto broken, growing, and dormant shoots.  A shoot was classified as broken if it had no \nterminal bud, even if the remaining leaves were intact.  Broken shoots were also separated \ninto \u201csoft\u201d and \u201ccoarse\u201d categories.  The coarse category included pieces of broken stem \nand those broken shoots where the most mature leaf broke, if folded on one side parallel to \nthe mid-rib.  The weight of broken shoots and coarse broken shoots were then expressed as \na proportion of the total fresh weight of the sample.  The growing shoots were categorised \naccording to the number of unfurled leaves, the number of shoots in each category was \ncounted, and each sample was weighed.  The mean shoot weight (fresh) at each harvest \nwas calculated as the total weight (including broken shoots) divided by the total number of \nbuds.  For each harvest, the total number of shoots harvested per plot was also determined \nby dividing the total fresh weight harvested by the respective mean shoot weight.    \n \nPlant vigour: the effects of different harvesting treatments on the inherent long-term  \nvigour and productivity of the tea plants were assessed indirectly using several parameters.  \nIn experiment 1a, to provide a measure of harvesting intensity, seasonal measurements \nwere made of the increase in the height of the canopy surface (known as the plucking \ntable) above the ground at five randomly selected points in each plot.  The leaf area index \n  \n8\nwas also measured in experiment 1a in June 1995 immediately prior to pruning, and in \nexperiment 2 in February 1995.  The total area of leaves within a 200 mm x 200 mm \nsection, taken through the centre of one representative bush from the guard row of each \nplot in each of three or four replicates, was measured using the technique described by \nPethiyagoda and Rajendram (1965).  This was converted to the equivalent leaf area index \nby dividing by the projected ground area (0.04 m\u00b2).  In experiment 1b, the leaf area index \nwas measured in May 2000, immediately prior to pruning, on two bushes within each \ntreatment of two replicate blocks.    \nWhen the bushes in experiment 1a were pruned in mid-July 1995, all the foliage was \nremoved above a height of 0.45 m.  The fresh weights of the prunings, taken from one \nrepresentative bush per plot, were recorded.  After chopping and mixing, the dry matter \ncontent of a sub-sample (about 50 g) was then determined by drying in an oven to constant \nweight. \n \nRESULTS \nEffects of harvest method on yield \nIn experiment 1a, the first two harvests after the imposition of treatments were \ninfluenced by the changeover in harvesting practice, with a large proportion of coarse \nbroken shoots (20 - 50 %) from plots harvested with the blade or shears.  At the third \nharvest, in September 1992, the coarse component had declined in all treatments to below \n20 % where it remained.  The yields reported here therefore begin from 1 September 1992.  \nWith that exception, the annual yields presented are for 12-month periods, 1 June to 31 \nMay (Fig. 3). \nBy commercial standards the annual yields of dried tea obtained were large, ranging \nfrom 4000 to 8500 kg ha-1.  In experiment 1a, yields tended to increase with time for all \nharvesting treatments, even into the fifth year from prune (1994\/95).  The decline in yields \nobserved in experiment 1b between June 1998 and May 1999, which was also apparent on \ncommercial estates, was associated with an annual rainfall of only 650 mm compared to \n1290 mm in the preceding 12 months.   \nBlade harvesting clone K35 (large shoots) gave similar yields to hand harvesting in \neach year of experiment 1a (Fig. 3a).    However, with clone K35 over the four years in \nexperiment 1b, there was an 8 % advantage (p < 0.05) in favour of hand harvesting (6540 \n\u00b1 486 kg ha-1 a-1) compared to the blade (6065 \u00b1 401 kg ha-1 a-1).  By contrast, blade \nharvesting clone T207 (small shoots) resulted in annual yields 19 to 24 % greater than \nthose from hand harvesting in the third (1992\/93) and fifth (1994\/95) years after pruning in \nexperiment 1a (Fig. 3b).  In experiment 1b, harvesting clone 207 with a blade rather than \nby hand resulted in: a yield benefit of 10 % in the first (1996\/97) and second years \n(1997\/98) after pruning, similar yields in the third year (1998\/99), and a yield loss of 6 % \nin the fourth year (1999\/2000). \nAcross the two clones, the flat (5-mm step) shears resulted in lower (p < 0.05)  yields \nthan those obtained by hand and blade harvesting in the fourth year from pruning \n(1993\/94) in experiment 1a, and in each year of experiment 1b.  There were indications \nthat the yield reductions from these flat shears, relative to hand harvesting, were greater for \nK35 (large shoots) than T207 (small shoots).  Across all seven years of both experiments \nthe average annual yield from K35 when using flat shears (5470 \u00b1 330 kg ha-1) was 14 % \nless than that obtained by hand harvesting (6360 \u00b1 355 kg ha-1).  For T207, the \ncorresponding values were 5900 \u00b1 263 kg ha-1, - 8 %, and 6420 \u00b1 315 kg ha-1. \n \n  \n9\n(a) Clone K35 \ns.e.d .\n0\n2000\n4000\n6000\n8000\n10000\nYi\nel\nd \nof\n d\nrie\nd \nte\na \n(k\ng \nha\n-1\n)\n \n(b) Clone T207 \ns.e.d .\n0\n2000\n4000\n6000\n8000\n10000\nSept 92-\nMay 93\nJun 93-\nMay 94\nJun 94-\nMay 95\nDec 95-\nMay 96\nJune 96 -\nMay 97\nJune 97-\nMay 98\nJune 98-\nMay 99\nJune 99-\nMay 00\nHarvest period\nYi\nel\nd \nof\n d\nrie\nd \nte\na \n(k\ng \nha\n-1\n)\nFig. 3.

This response is \nintermediate to that observed for K35 and T207 in experiment 1b.  For T282 (large \nshoots), when using flat shears the corresponding mean annual yield (5140 \u00b1 470 kg ha-1) \nwas 85% of that (6030 \u00b1 388 kg ha-1) obtained by hand harvesting (Fig. 4b).

This was equivalent to 51 \nand 38 kg dry tea ha-1 per mm increase in step height, over the range 5 to 32 mm, for clone \nK35 and T207 respectively (Fig. 3).  In experiment 1b, following the introduction of \ntreatments 12 months after pruning and the removal of the levelling plates, the effect of \nstep height appeared to change.  Between June 1996 and May 2000, whereas the annual \nyields from K35 (large shoots) were similar regardless of step height (5 to 22 mm; Fig. \n3a), yields from T207 (small shoots) increased at an average rate of 27 kg ha-1 mm-1 (Fig. \n3b). \n \nEffects of harvest interval on yield \nWhen using flat shears (experiments 1a and 1b), doubling the harvest interval from 2 \nto 4 P increased the mean annual yields from K35, over the seven years, by an average of \n17 % from 5470 \u00b1 330 kg ha-1 to 6400 \u00b1 295 kg ha-1 (Fig. 5).  This is equivalent to an \nannual yield increase of 465 kg ha-1 per phyllochron.  This response appeared to be more \nconsistent during the second pruning cycle (1996 - 2000) than the first (1992 - 1995). \nThe effects of incremental changes in the harvest interval on K35 (large shoots) were \nalso examined in experiment 2 using 22-mm step shears.  Increasing the harvesting \ninterval from 1.8 to 4.2 P increased annual yields of dry tea from 4780 to 6260 kg ha-1, \nequivalent to about 620 kg ha-1 per phyllochron (Fig. 6).  During the four years of \nexperiment 3, the mean increase in the annual yield of the shear-harvested shoots from \nclone T282 was equivalent to 740 kg ha-1 per phyllochron (data not shown).  \n \n  \n11\ns.e.d.\n0\n2000\n4000\n6000\n8000\nSept 92-\nMay 93\nJun 93-\nMay 94\nJun 94-\nMay 95\nDec 95-\nMay 96\nJune 96\n- May 97\nJune 97-\nMay 98\nJune 98-\nMay 99\nJune 99-\nMay 00\nHarvest period\nYi\nel\nd \nof\n d\nrie\nd \nte\na \n(k\ng \nha\n-1\n)\n \nFig. 5.

By contrast, for T282 (large shoots), annual yield benefits were apparent in the \nthird, fourth and fifth years from pruning averaging 540 kg ha-1 per phyllochron (Fig. 7a).  \nSimilar comparisons were made with blade harvesting (experiment 3, K7).  In the second \nyear after pruning the yields at intervals of 2, 3 and 4 P were similar, but in the third, \nfourth and fifth years after pruning, the annual yield benefit from extending the harvest \ninterval from 2 to 4 P averaged about 670 kg ha-1 per phyllochron (Fig. 7b). \n \nEffects of harvest method on shoot numbers and composition \nIn experiment 1a with clone K35 (large shoots), similar numbers of shoots (2170-2740 \nm-2) were harvested from the hand, blade and flat-shear plots within each year (Table 1a).  \nHowever, increasing the step height on the shears to 32 mm decreased the number of \nharvested shoots by 25-30% from 2460-2740 m-2 to 1840-1880 m-2.  For T207 (small \nshoots), the number of shoots harvested with the blade and the flat-shear (5300-5530 m-2) \nwas 15-20% greater than that (4620 m-2) harvested by hand in the third year after pruning \n(1992\/93), and similar (4260-4890 m-2) in the fourth (1993\/94) and fifth (1994\/95) years.   \nAdding a 30-mm step to the flat shear reduced the number of harvested shoots within a \ngiven year by 20-32% from 4680-5300 m-2 to 3550-3730 m-2. \nIn the same experiment, during the fourth year after prune (1993\/94), hand-harvesting \nK35 and T207 at 2 P intervals resulted in mean shoot weights of 1.02 and 0.55 g \nrespectively (Table 1b), just above those corresponding to shoots with three unfurled \nleaves, 0.89 and 0.47 g respectively (Fig. 8). \nFor K35, the mean weight of shoots harvested using a blade was similar to that from \nhand harvesting (Table 1b).  By contrast with T207, in the fourth and fifth years after \npruning (1993\/94 and 1994\/95), shoots harvested with a blade were 7 - 13 % heavier than \n  \n13\nthose from hand harvesting.  Across the three years, the mean weights of shoots harvested \nfrom K35 and T207 with flat shears were 87 and 88 % respectively of those obtained by \nhand-harvesting.  There was also a trend, significant for T207 in 1992\/93 and 1994\/95, for \nmean shoot weight to increase with step height.  \n \nTable 1.

T207 showed a \nsimilar response. \n  \n14\nWith hand harvesting, the proportion of coarse broken shoots obtained from clones \nK35 and T207 ranged from 3.7 to 6.3 % (Table 1d).  Although the effect was not always \nsignificant, blade harvesting increased this proportion (6.8 - 9.4 %).  In the first nine \nmonths following the imposition of treatments, shear harvesting resulted in more coarse \nbroken shoots (8.3-8.5%) than hand harvesting (5.7-5.8%). However by 1994\/95, two \nyears after the imposition of treatments, values were uniformly low (3.8 - 4.7 %) for both \nharvesting methods. \n \n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n0 1 2 3 4\nNumber of unfurled leaves on harvested shoot\nSh\noo\nt f\nre\nsh\n w\nei\ngh\nt (\ng)\n \nFig. 8.

In the same \nexperiment for clone T207, doubling the harvest interval reduced the number of harvested \nshoots by 23 % from 4680 to 3580 m-2 and increased the mean shoot weight by 49 % from \n0.51 to 0.76 g.  Although doubling the harvest interval decreased the proportion of broken \nshoots from 58 \u2013 60 % to 44 \u2013 46 %, the proportions of coarse broken shoots were similar \n(5.2 - 7.2 %). \n \nTable 2.

Based on an extrapolation of the results presented in Fig. 8, these \nweights correspond to shoots with three and five unfurled leaves respectively.  A further \nincrease in the harvest interval from 3.6 to 4.2 P had no additional effect on shoot numbers \nand weight.  When the harvest interval was increased from 1.8 to 3.6 P, the proportions of \nbroken shoots and coarse broken shoots declined from 65 to 55 %, and from 7.7 to 4.4 % \nrespectively (Table 3).   \n \nTable 3.

In \ngeneral, the canopy height increase was least with the blade and flat shears and greatest for \nthe 32-mm step shears (Table 4).  The canopy of clone T207 consistently rose more \nrapidly than that of K35, and the increase was greater in the fifth year from pruning \n(1994\/95) than in the third and fourth years.  \nFollowing three years of differential harvesting, the leaf area indices recorded before \npruning were greatest on bushes harvested with the step shears, and least for the flat shears \n(Table 4).  Values were consistently larger for T207 than for K35, for example 12.1 and \n7.1 respectively for hand harvested plants, a reflection again of differences in plant \nmorphology.  The lowest and highest values recorded were 4.7 (flat shear; K35) and 14.8 \n(32-mm step shear; T207).    \nAt the end of experiment 1a, large dry weights of prunings were associated with large \nrises in the table height and large leaf area indices (Table 4).  The mean weight of prunings \nobtained from T207 (24 t ha-1) was almost significantly (p = 0.06) greater than that from \nK35 (19 t ha-1).  There was no significant (p \u2264 0.05) clone x harvest method interaction.  \nAlthough the weights of prunings obtained from the hand, blade and flat shear treatments \nwere similar, they increased with step height (from 5 to 32 mm).  \nIn the 12 months following pruning, all the plots were hand harvested, regardless of \nprevious harvesting methods, to monitor any residual effects on bush vigour.  Yields were \ngenerally similar, but there was a suggestion that, for both clones, bushes previously \n  \n16\nharvested by the shears out-yielded those that had been harvested by hand or blade (Table \n4). \n \nTable 4.

This is followed by a consideration of the results \nfrom blade and shear harvesting.  For shear-harvesting, the effects of step height and the \nchoice of harvest interval are also examined. \n It is important first to consider the environment in which this research was \nconducted, particularly the effect of temperature on shoot size and density.  In the tea area \n(ca. 1800 m asl) of the Mufindi District of Southern Tanzania, the monthly mean air \ntemperature ranges from 13 to 18 \u00b0C. The annual mean temperature of 16.5 \u00b0C is similar to \nthe value recorded at high altitudes (up to 2200 m asl) close to the equator, where seasonal \nvariations are small, for example at the Tea Research Foundation of Kenya in the Kericho \nDistrict of Kenya (15 - 17 \u00b0C), but substantially less than those (18 \u2013 24 \u00b0C) found at the \nheadquarters of the Tea Research Foundation of Central Africa, Mulanje, Southern Malawi \n(ca. 650 m asl), where seasonal variations are large (Carr and Stephens, 1992).  Low air \ntemperatures result in reduced shoot extension and development rates (Burgess and Carr, \n1997), which make true selective plucking difficult.  Hence the commercial practice used \nin Southern Tanzania, known as 'hard\u2019 or \u2018black\u2019 plucking, involves the removal of all but \nthe very smallest shoots that protrude above the canopy surface.  By using derived \n  \n18\nrelationships between shoot development rate and air temperature to specify the harvest \ninterval for non-drought stressed tea in a rational and reproducible way, it is possible to \nallow for the seasonal differences in temperature (Burgess and Carr, 1998).  Corrections \ncan also be made for the effect of potential soil water deficit (Burgess and Carr, 1998).   In \nturn, this approach allows the results to be extrapolated to elsewhere in East Africa (for \nexample), and for tea harvesting to be scheduled in a scientific way, particularly for clones. \n \nHand harvesting \nAnnual yields, excluding the year following pruning, obtained by hand harvesting the \nmorphological contrasting clones K35 and T207 ranged from 5.7 to 7.9 t ha-1.  These \nvalues are substantially more than the corresponding quantities harvested by hand from \nmainly seedling tea on commercial estates in the Mufindi District (currently about 4 t ha-1), \nand suggest potential target yields in this locality.  Some of this difference is due to the \ndifficulty in maintaining a tightly-regulated harvesting regime, which results in the \nremoval of all of the desired shoots at each harvest, particularly when employing workers \non a piece-rate basis.  Care therefore needs to be taken when directly relating experimental \nresults to commercial practice.  For example, it can be difficult to harvest by hand large \nyields from vigorous clones having a large number of small shoots such as T207, except in \nthe initial stages of a pruning cycle when shoot density is low.  The close monitoring of \nplucking standards, together with improved crop nutrition, may also explain why the hand \nharvested yields in experiment 1a increased from the fourth to the fifth year after pruning, \nwhereas yields on local commercially-managed estates tend to decline after the third year. \nIt is not only yield that is important, as the quality of the harvested shoots and the \nresulting processed tea can have a large effect on the price realised in the world market and \nhence the profitability of tea production by estates or smallholders.  Because we were \nunable to get reliable assessments of treatment effects on the value of the processed tea, we \nrelied on criteria used to assess the quality of the fresh shoots entering the factory gate, \nnamely mean shoot weight, the number of unfurled leaves on the shoots, and the \nproportions of broken shoots and coarse broken shoots. \nIn Kenya, Obanda and Owuor (1995) compared the quality of black tea produced from \nshoots with one, two, three and four unfurled leaves from two clones.  As the number of \nunfurled leaves increased, the theaflavin content was reduced and the associated liquor had \nless colour (i.e. tended towards yellow rather than red) for both clones.  Although coarse \nshoots decreased the brightness of the liquor for one clone, this effect was not significant \nfor the other.  Coarse shoots also tend to decrease caffeine content and, in Kenya, the \naroma quality of black tea (Owuor and Obanda, 1998).   Hence professional tasters and \nbuyers generally place a lower value on tea produced from coarse, rather than fine, shoots.  \nHowever the magnitude of this reduction will be dependant on the clone and the specific \nenvironmental conditions (Obanda and Owuor, 1995; Nyirenda, 1995).  For example, in \nMalawi, Nyirenda (1995) reported a 1 to 13 % decline in the value of tea harvested from \nfive clones if shoots with four rather than three unfurled leaves were processed. \n  In experiment 1a, the mean fresh shoot weight for a given harvesting standard varied \nconsiderably with clone.  Although hand-harvesting K35 and T207 at 2 P intervals resulted \nin mean shoot weights corresponding to shoots with three unfurled leaves in both clones, \nshoots from K35 (0.89 g) were about 90% heavier than those (0.47 g) from T207 (Fig. 8). \nBroken shoots can lead to premature oxidation of the harvested shoots and consequent \nreduced quality of the processed tea.  For the hand-harvested treatment in experiment 1a \n(Table 1), the proportion of broken pieces increased from 40 to 48 % between the third and \nfifth years after pruning.  These values are larger than those reported (26 - 28%) for hand \n  \n19\nand shear harvesting of seedling tea in Malawi (Nyasulu, 2001), and Clowes (1986) \nsuggested that the maximum proportion by weight of broken shoots in Malawi should be \nbetween 10 and 20 %, depending on the time from pruning.  Using the same definition of \n\u201cbroken shoots\u201d as used in this paper, Seyfullah (2001) reported that the proportion of \nbroken shoots from hand-harvested clone PC 108 within an experiment in Southern \nMalawi was 24-33% during the growing season in the third year after prune.  The high \nproportion of broken shoots, reported in this paper for harvesting experiments in Southern \nTanzania, is probably a result of the local commercial practice of \u2018hard\u2019 or \u2018black\u2019 \nplucking and the difficulty in harvesting small shoots, resulting from relatively low \ntemperatures and extended pruning cycles, compared to larger shoots that are produced in \nMalawi.   \nThe mean proportion, by weight, of coarse broken shoots from hand-harvesting clone \nK35 ranged from 3.6 to 5.6 %.  These values are close to that (3 %) reported for hand \nharvested clonal tea from Malawi (Jose, 1998; Seyfullah, 2001), but higher than the levels \n(0.3 - 0.7 %) reported for both hand and shear harvesting of experimental seedling tea in \nthe same country (Nyasulu, 2001). \n \nBlade harvesting \nIn experiment 1a, the use of the blade instead of hand harvesting, increased the yield \nfrom clone T207 (small shoots) by about 15 %.  This yield increase resulted from the \nharvest of more shoots in the third year after pruning and the harvest of heavier shoots in \nthe fourth and fifth years (Table 1a).  By contrast, in the same experiment, there was no \nconsistent difference between the yields from hand and blade harvested clone K35 (large \nshoots).  One explanation for this is that, in the early stages of a pruning cycle, whereas it \nis relatively easy to remove most of the shoots of a large-leaf clone by hand, a greater \nproportion of the shoots of the small-leaf clone will be left on the bush.  This is supported \nby the greater canopy height rise of hand-harvested compared to blade-harvested T207 for \nthe period June 1992 to April 1994 (Table 4).   \nThe relative intensity of blade harvesting in experiment 1a was also examined by \ndetermining a \u2018harvest index\u2019, defined as the dry yield of harvested shoots (Fig. 3) divided \nby the total dry matter produced above the height of the last prune (i.e. the sum of the \nweight of prunings plus harvested shoots, ignoring any fallen leaves; Table 4).  For the \nperiod between September 1992 and May 1995, the \u2018harvest indices\u2019 calculated in this way \nfor the blade harvested treatments (52 \u2013 56 %) were greater than those for hand harvesting \n(44 - 47 %). \nAlthough the proportion of broken shoots resulting from blade harvesting was similar \nto that from hand harvesting, the proportion of coarse broken shoots was greater (7 - 9 % \ncompared to 4 - 6 %).  A high proportion of coarse broken shoots increases the mean age \nof the harvested material and this may result in less theaflavin content and a reduction in \nthe 'total colour' of the resultant liquor (Jose, 1998).  In Malawi, the value of the tea \nprocessed from shoots with 10 % coarse broken shoots was 10 % less than that of tea with \nno coarse fraction, and the relationship was broadly linear between 0 and 40% (Jose, \n1998).  The results presented here therefore suggest that in Malawi, the increased coarse \nmaterial associated with blade harvesting would reduce the value of the processed tea by 2 \n- 3 % compared to hand harvesting. \n  \nShear harvesting \nHarvesting with a flat shear reduced the yield of both K35 (large shoots) and T207 \n(small shoots) relative to hand harvesting. However, this reduction averaged over seven \n  \n20\nharvest years (experiments 1a and 1b) was greater for the clone with large (-14 %) rather \nthan small (-8 %) shoots.  Again, this difference may reflect the relative difficulty of \nharvesting by hand all the shoots from clone T207.   \nThe proportion of broken shoots in the samples harvested using flat shears (50 \u2013 65 %) \nwas greater than those resulting from hand or blade harvesting (40 \u2013 50 %) (Table 1c).  \nThis difference was probably caused by double cutting shoots when using shears.  In \nsouthern India, Ravichandran and Partiban (1998) also reported that shear harvesting led to \na greater proportion of mechanically-injured than unbroken shoots.  One way to decrease \nthe proportion of broken shoots is to extend the harvest interval (Tables 2 and 3), as \ndiscussed later.  The proportion of coarse broken shoots obtained with the flat shear was \n2.5 \u2013 2.8 % greater than that for hand harvesting during the initial nine months after the \nimposition of harvesting treatments, but similar in the third year.  A similar increase of \nabout 1 % point in the proportion of coarse broken shoots in shear harvested compared to \nhand harvested samples has also been reported in Malawi (Jose, 1998). \n \nStep height: in experiment 1a, harvesting clone K35 with a flat shear reduced the annual \ncanopy height rise to 12 - 25 mm and reduced the leaf area index to 4.7 (Table 4).  In this \nexperiment, the shears were introduced after the bushes had been harvested by hand for 25 \nmonths following pruning.  By contrast in experiment 1b, the use of a flat-shear on the \nsame clone reduced the leaf area index to 3.3 (Table 5).  The lower leaf area index in \nexperiment 1b, compared to that in experiment 1a, may partly be a result of the shear being \nintroduced 12 months, rather than 25 months, from pruning.  This may have prevented the \nestablishment of a sufficiently-dense canopy to support the shears or to maintain bush \nproductivity. \nAssuming Beer\u2019s law (Saeki, 1963; Squire, 1990) and a light extinction coefficient for \ntea of 0.6 (Burgess and Carr, 1996b), leaf area indices of 4.7 and 3.3 would result in the \nleaves intercepting only 94 % and 86 % respectively of the incident solar radiation, \ncompared with 99 % at an index of 8.0.  Below a certain leaf area index, the reduction in \nlight interception will have a significant effect on tea yields and long-term plant vigour.  \nWhereas, in experiment 1a, a decline in the leaf area index of large-leaf clone K35 to 4.7 \nappeared to have no significant effect on the subsequent yield in the year after pruning, \nleaf area indices below 4.0 were associated with reduced yields in experiment 1b.  Further \nresearch is needed to establish the critical leaf area index required to maintain maximum \ntea yields.  However the results presented here suggest that a leaf area index of about 4 \nmay be critical. \nWhere the leaf area index was maintained above about 4, adding a step on the shear \ngenerally reduce yields.  In experiment 1a, during the fourth and fifth years (1993\/94 \u2013 \n1994\/95) from prune, the annual yield reduction was equivalent to 62 kg ha-1 per mm \nincrease in step height for K35, and 46 kg ha-1 mm-1 for T207.   This yield reduction was \nthe result of harvesting less shoots and, in part, a lower proportion of coarse broken shoots.  \nThis effect was less apparent in experiment 1b.  This may partly be a result of the lower \nleaf area indices, discussed above.  In addition the removal of the levelling plate on the \nupper blade in 1996 may have allowed individuals to tilt the shears into the canopy, \nmitigating the primary effect of the step. \nOn the basis of these observations, a possible strategy for designing a harvesting \npolicy with shears (that cannot be tilted) is to choose the minimum step height that will \ncreate an adequate leaf area index to maintain yields.  Once this minimum leaf area index \nis achieved, then experiment 1a indicates that any further increase in step height will \ndecrease yield.  Because of the reduced capacity of a tea canopy with a low shoot density \n  \n21\nto support shears, the minimum step height to maintain an adequate leaf area index is \nlikely to be greater for large-leaf clones with a low shoot density, or for clones in the early \nstages of the pruning cycle, than for small-leaf clones with a high shoot density.  However \nother clonal differences, such as variations in the rate of leaf abscission may also be \nimportant.  \n \nHarvest interval: the mean fresh weight of a shoot harvested with a flat shear in \nexperiment 1a was about 90 % of that obtained by hand harvesting.  To harvest shoots of a \nsimilar size to those obtained by hand harvesting (assuming they are the optimum size), a \ncase can therefore be made for extending the harvest interval when harvesting with shears.  \nIn experiment 1a, when using a flat shear to harvest clone K35, extending the harvest \ninterval from 2 to 4 P increased the mean shoot weight from 0.90 to 1.37 g, equivalent to \n0.23 g per phyllochron (Table 2).  In experiment 2, extending the harvest interval from 1.8 \nto 3.6 P using the 22-mm step shear increased the mean fresh weight of a harvested shoot \nfrom 0.83 to 1.45 g, equivalent to 0.34 g per phyllochron (Table 3).  For the same period \n(1993\/94), the corresponding mean shoot weight from hand harvesting was 1.02 g (Table \n1).  Based on this analysis, to raise the mean shoot weight from 0.90 g to about 1.00 g \n(equivalent to that obtained from hand harvesting), the harvest interval for the flat shear \ncould be increased by between 0.35 and 0.50 P.  \nAn additional effect of extending the harvest interval was to increase yields.  In \nexperiment 1a, lengthening the harvest interval from 2 to 4 P when using the flat shear \nresulted in a mean annual yield increase (from K35) of 570 kg ha-1 per phyllochron (Fig. \n5).  In experiment 2, when using the 22-mm step shear on the same clone, extending the \nharvest interval from 1.8 to 4.2 P raised the annual yield by 1480 kg ha-1, equivalent to 620 \nkg ha-1 per phyllochron (Fig. 6).  On this basis, lengthening the harvest interval by 0.5 P is \nlikely to increase the annual yield when using flat shears by about 300 kg ha-1.  This would \nhave been sufficient to offset about 60% of the yield loss observed in experiment 1a, when \nshear and hand harvesting were compared at a harvest interval of 2 P. \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n\u2022 The results of these experiments demonstrate the large yields and acceptable shoot \nquality that can be obtained from closely-monitored hand-harvested tea in the Mufindi \nDistrict.   \n\u2022 The use of blades, with an appropriate plate and supervision, can result in even higher \nyields than hand harvesting, particularly for clones with a large number of small shoots \nthat are difficult to harvest by hand (+13 %).   \n\u2022 Further research is required to establish the minimum leaf area index needed to \nmaintain maximum tea yields.  The results presented here suggest that it may be about \n4.  Assuming that this minimum leaf area is maintained then the step height on a shear \nshould be as small as possible, as an increased step height leads to reduced yields.  \nBecause of the limited capacity of a tea canopy with a low shoot density to support the \nshears, the minimum step height is likely to be greater for large-leaf clones with a low \nshoot density than for small-leaf clones with a high shoot density.     \n\u2022 Using shears, at the same harvest interval as hand harvesting (2 P), results in lower \nyields and a higher proportion of broken shoots.  However because the mean shoot size \nis smaller than that harvested by hand, the harvest interval could be extended slightly, \nup to 2.5 P, when shears are used.   \n\u2022 The impact of harvesting method on labour productivity and the value of the processed \ntea still needs to be evaluated. \n  \n22\n \nAcknowledgements:  During the initial work reported here, the Ngwazi Tea Research \nStation was sponsored by an industrial consortium comprising Brooke Bond Tanzania \nLtd., Mufindi Tea Company Ltd., and Tanganyika Wattle Company Ltd.
