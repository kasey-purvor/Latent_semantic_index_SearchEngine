INTRODUCTION \nIon Beam Synthesis (IBS - ion beam implantation followed \nby a subsequent high temperature anneal) has been used for a \nnumber of years to fabricate silicide structures in silicon [1].  \nOne group of silicides that has attracted considerable interest \nare the semiconducting silicides, especially those with a direct \ngap and a band gap energy smaller than that of silicon.  Two \nsuch silicides are the beta phase of iron disilicide (\u03b2-FeSi2) \n[2,3] and diruthenium trisilicide (Ru2Si3) [4]. \nFeSi2 can exist in two stable phases, the metallic high \ntemperature \u03b1 phase that has a tetragonal structure (and \ncontains ~18% Fe vacancies) and the semiconducting low \ntemperature \u03b2 phase, which has an orthorhombic structure [1- \n3], and a composition close to that of stoichiometric FeSi2.  \nThe \u03b2 to \u03b1 phase transition is reported to occur at about 940\u00b0C \n[1,2].  There has been some debate in the literature [3] about \nthe nature of the band gap in \u03b2-FeSi2, and there are now a \nconsiderable number of experimental observations, which \nindicate a direct gap of 0.8\u20130.9 eV [2,3].  These results point \nto a number of potential applications for \u03b2-FeSi2 in such areas \nas solar cells, light emitters and detector technology.  The \ngroup at Surrey showed that \u03b2-FeSi2 fabricated by IBS has a \ndirect gap and can produce room temperature electro \nluminescence (EL), albeit weakly, at approximately \u03bb = 1.5 \n\u00b5m [5,6]. \nThe commercial exploitation of ion beam synthesised \u03b2-\nFeSi2 will require increases in beam current to enable material \nfabrication on reasonable time scales.  Hitherto most material \nhas been fabricated at medium to low beam currents, typically \na few hundred micro amps or less.  In this paper we present \nrecent work where we have extended synthesis to implantation \nin the milliamp range.  This use of increased beam current \nreduces the implant time to commercially realistic values (~30 \nminutes to implant a 100 mm wafer to a dose of 1.5x1017 Fe \ncm-2).  At high currents very different growth and formation of \nthe silicide has been observed to occur with only small \nchanges in the process parameters, and this will be described \nin detail below \nII. EXPERIMENTAL \nA commercial ion implanter, a Danfysik 1090, was used to \nimplant 100 mm diameter (100) single crystal n-type Si wafers \nwith 180 keV Fe+ to a dose of 1.5-2x1017 Fe cm-2.  The \nimplant area was 49 cm2.  The wafers were implanted using a \nbeam current on sample of either 1.5mA or 0.6mA. The wafers \nwere attached to a liquid-nitrogen cooled chuck stage and were \nheated, during implantation, using the power of the incident \nion beam.  The wafer achieved its equilibrium temperature \nafter 1-2 minutes of implantation.  The temperature at the \ncentre of the wafer was measured during implantation using an \noptical pyrometer.  For a beam current of 1.5mA the \ntemperature at the centre of the wafer was approximately \n500\u00b0C.  For the lower beam current (0.6mA) the temperature \nwas closer to 250\u00b0C.  The total implant time ranged from \nabout 30 minutes for the higher beam current to 135 minutes \nfor the lower. \n    - 579 -   0-7803-7155-0\/02\/$10.00 \u00a9 2002 IEEE\nAfter implantation the wafers were cut into smaller samples \nsome of which were annealed.  Annealing was carried out in a \nProcess Products Corporation optical furnace using a nitrogen \nambient, for 18 hours at 900\u00b0C.  Structural and optical \nmeasurements were carried out on both as-implanted and \nannealed material.  Cross-sectional TEM (XTEM), was used \nto provide structural and phase information on the samples.  \nRutherford backscattering (RBS) measurements using 1.5MeV \nHe ions were undertaken to study the iron depth distribution as \na function of implant and annealing conditions. \nRoom temperature optical absorption measurements were \nused to yield the optical band gap energy of the material.  A \ntungsten lamp was used as the source in the wavelength range \n1100-1700 nm.  A liquid nitrogen cooled germanium (PIN) \ndetector connected to a grating spectrometer was used for \nthese absorption measurements. Full details of the \nexperimental system used can be found elsewhere [2,11].  \nFourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to \ndetermine the phonon spectra of the silicide material, using a \nNicolet Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 460 spectrometer in the range 600-225 cm-1 \nIII RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n3.1 Structural Measurements \nThe RBS spectra of as-implanted and annealed samples \nimplanted at the lower (250\u00b0C) and higher (550\u00b0C) implant \ntemperatures are shown in beam currents in Figures 1 and 2, \nrespectively.  The implanted dose was 1.5x1017 Fe cm-2 in each \ncase. . The data was analysed using the IBA Data Furnace [7].  \nFrom the RBS spectra it is clear that the depth profile of the \niron, and its behaviour up on annealing, is quite different at the \ntwo implant temperatures. For the sample implanted at the \nhigher temperature (Fig. 2), the position of the peak in the iron \ndepth distribution did not change significantly after annealing, \nwhereas for the sample implanted at the lower temperature \n(Fig. 1) it shifted towards the surface after annealing.

Figures 3 and \n4 show XTEM micrographs for the sample implanted at 250\u00b0C \nand 550\u00b0C before and after annealing (Figure 3a and 3b \nrespectively for the 250\u00b0C implant and Figure 4a and 4b for \nthe 550\u00b0C implant).  For the lower temperature implant, the \nsilicon is amorphised during implantation and its subsequent \nregrowth during annealing facilitates the transport of iron \ntowards the surface ahead of the regrowth front.  Thus the \nstructure after annealing consists of a continuous layer of \npolycrystalline \u03b2FeSi2 some 150 nm thick.  The sample \nimplanted at the higher temperature retains its crystallinity \nduring implantation.   Fig. 4a indicates the presence of small \nprecipitates of \u03b2FeSi2, which range in size and density \nfollowing the implanted depth distribution, with the largest \nprecipitates being found at the peak of the distribution.  When \nthis sample is subsequently annealed at 900\u00b0C these \nprecipitates grow at the expense of smaller precipitates \nsurrounding them in a manner similar to that described for \noxygen implanted silicon [8-10].  After annealing at 900\u00b0C for \n18 hours these precipitates are typically 200nm in diameter.  \n3.2 Optical Measurements \nRoom temperature optical absorption measurements were \ncarried out to determine the effect of the above structural \ndifference on the band gap energy of the materials.  Figure 5 \nplots the square of the absorption coefficient (alpha squared) \nverses photon energy for samples of the two types of structure \nafter annealing.  The linear regions of the plot are indicative of \na direct band gap semiconductor.  Extrapolation to the baseline \nyields the value of the band gap energy, this is found to be \n0.82eV for the sample implanted at 550\u00b0C and 0.89eV for the \n250\u00b0C implant. The below band gap absorption in Figure 5 has \nbeen previously reported for \u03b2-FeSi2, and can be described by \nthe usual Urbach expression [11].   \nThese results are consistent with those reported in the \nliterature.  It has been observed that the magnitude of the band \ngap is different for continuous layers of \u03b2-FeSi2 than for \nprecipitate structures (the latter having the smaller band gap) \n[12].  Theoretical reports by Miglio et al. [13] suggest a strain \ndependence of the band gap value of \u03b2-FeSi2.  The strain for \nthe surface FeSi2 layer would be expected to be lower than a \nprecipitate structure. \n In the infrared region between 180 and 500 cm-1 \u03b2-FeSi2 \nexhibits an intense phonon spectrum [14-16].  It has been \nshown that this phonon spectrum varies with the structural \nquality of the layers, crystallographic orientation of the \nprecipitates, precipitate size and thermal treatment of \u03b2-FeSi2 \n[14-16].  The phonon spectrum, measured by FTIR \nspectroscopy, for the samples implanted at 250\u00b0C and 550\u00b0C \nis shown in Fig. 6. Examination of Fig. 6 reveals that while \nboth samples show the characteristic peaks associated with \u03b2-\nFeSi2, the two spectra are shifted by 10 cm-1 with respect to \neach other and the relative intensity of the peaks is quite \ndifferent. \nIn their paper G. Guizzetti et al. [16] reported far infrared \nreflectivity measurements with polarised light on small single-\ncrystalline \u03b2-FeSi2 specimens.  They found significant \ndifferences between the IR spectra taken at different \npolarisations with respect to the crystal axis.  This anisotropy \nis evident in Figure 6 as well.  The XTEM measurements on \nthe surface layer and buried precipitate materials showed \ndifferent crystallographic orientations between the two cases.  \nIn the surface silicide case the dominant orientation was \ndominated by the type I orientation of low lattice mismatches, \nwhile in the buried precipitate case it was random due to \nrelaxation from the highly strained prior type II orientation.  \nDetail information for crystallographic analysis of IBS iron \ndisilicides was presented in a previous elsewhere [17].  The \ndifference in the IR spectra in Fig. 6 also reflects this \ndifference in orientation \nCONCLUSIONS \nTwo quite different types of structure are produced when \nFe is implanted at 250\u00b0C and 550\u00b0C at relatively high beam \ncurrent densities.  For the lower temperature implant \namorphisation occurs during implantation and the subsequent \nregrowth of this amorphous layer, during annealing at 900\u00b0C \nFigure 5: Absorption coefficient squared (alpha squared) vs energy plot for \nsamples implanted with 1.5x1017 Fe cm-2 at 250\u00b0C, and 550\u00b0C annealed \n(18 hrs at 900\u00b0C). \n0.0E+00\n3.0E+09\n6.0E+09\n9.0E+09\n1.2E+10\n1.5E+10\n0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0\nEnergy (eV)\nAl\nph\na \nSq\nua\nre\nd \n(1\n\/c\nm2\n)\n250\u00b0C implant \n550\u00b0C implant \n-0.1\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n225 300 375 450 525 600\nWavenumbers (cm-1)\nAb\nso\nrb\nan\nce\nSurface Layer\nBuried Precipitate Layer\n550\u00b0C implant \n250\u00b0C implant \nFigure 6: FTIR spectra after annealing at 900\u00b0C for 18 hours for the samples \nimplanted with 1.5x1017 Fe cm-2 at 250\u00b0C, and 550\u00b0C.  \n    - 581 -   0-7803-7155-0\/02\/$10.00 \u00a9 2002 IEEE\nfor 18 hours, facilitates the migration of iron towards the \nsurface to form a continuous 150 nm thick polycrystalline \nlayer of \u03b2FeSi2.  For the higher temperature implant \namorphisation does not occur and a buried layer of discrete \n\u03b2FeSi2 precipitates typically 200nm in diameter is formed after \nannealing.   A 70 meV decrease in the optical band gap is \nobserved in between a sample implanted at 250\u00b0C (0.89eV) \nand the one implanted at 550\u00b0C (0.82eV), a 10 cm-1 shift in the \nFTIR spectrum of is also observed..
