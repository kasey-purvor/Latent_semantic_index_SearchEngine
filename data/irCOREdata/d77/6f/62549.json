No significant up-regulation was detected for any of the \ngenes in either of the animals during the acute heat shock. The time course \nexperiment in O. validus produced slightly different results with an initial \ndown regulation in these genes at 2\u00b0C, but no significant up-regulation of the \ngenes either at 2\u00b0C or 6\u00b0C. Therefore the classical heat shock response is \nabsent in both species. The data is discussed in the context of the organisms\u2019 \nthermal tolerance and the applicability of HSP70 to monitor thermal stress in \nAntarctic marine organisms. \n \n \n \n \nKeywords: Antarctic, Climate change, biomarker, stress, heat shock proteins\n 2\nHSP_Invertebrate \nIntroduction \n \nThe production of heat shock proteins is one of the classical cellular \nresponses of all organisms to environmental insult. These highly conserved \nproteins act as chaperones to stabilise and refold  denatured proteins,  \npreventing the formation of cytotoxic aggregates, maintaining the integrity \nand functioning of the cell until conditions improve (Parsell and Lindquist, \n1993, Hartl, 1996, Fink, 1999). The most studied of these chaperone \nmolecules are the 70kD heat shock protein family (HSP70s) comprising \nconstitutive forms (HSC70: heat shock cognate 70) and stress inducible forms \n(HSP70s: heat shock protein 70) (Ritossa, 1962; Morimoto et al, 1998). Their \naction has been described in response to a wide variety of stresses, however \nthe classical activation of this family is in response to elevated environmental \ntemperatures (cf. Lund et al, 2002;  Tomanek and Sanford, 2003). Indeed \nthey are often suggested as primary ecological biomarkers (Feder and \nHofmann, 1999; Sorensen et al, 2003). \n \nOne of the regions of most rapid climate change on Earth is the Antarctic \nPeninsula, where shallow seawater temperatures along the west Antarctic \nPeninsula have risen in excess of 1\u00b0C over the last 50 years (Meredith and \nKing, 2005). This marine environment is also the habitat of some of the \nWorld\u2019s most stenothermal species described to date (Peck and Conway, \n2000). Although Antarctic invertebrates have survivable temperature \nenvelopes between 5\u00b0C and 12\u00b0C above the minimum sea temperature of -\n 3\nHSP_Invertebrate \n2\u00b0C (Peck 2002), they start to lose critical biological functions at temperatures  \n2-3\u00b0C  higher than current summer maxima (Peck et al, 2004). The question \nposed is how do we monitor the effects of heat stress in such organisms and \nare heat shock proteins the most appropriate biomarker for environmental \nstress in the Antarctic?  \n \nThe latter is particularly pertinent, given that with the exception of Hydra \noligactis (Bosch et al, 1988), the only species that have been shown to lack \nthe classical heat shock response are an Antarctic ciliate (La Terza et al 2001, \n2004) and two Antarctic notothenioid fish (Carpenter and Hofmann, 2000; \nHofmann et al, 2000; Place and Hofmann, 2005; Clark et al, 2007). In \naddition two Antarctic molluscs Laternula elliptica (bivalve) and Nacella \nconcinna (gastropod) have a demonstrable heat shock response, but at \nthreshold levels (10-15\u00b0C) that are incompatible with moderating any \ndeleterious effects from elevated Polar sea water temperatures (Clark et al, \n2008a). The example of N. concinna is slightly more complex, in that it occurs \ninter-tidally and HSP70 genes are induced in response to emersion, a situation \nwith a more complex suite of stressors than purely temperature (Clark et al, \n2008b). In a continuing survey into the HSP70 response and thermal stress in \nAntarctic marine species, we expanded the phylogenetic range of species to \ninclude a gamarid crustacean, Paraceradocus gibber and an echinoderm, \nOdontaster validus, two sub-tidal species that seasonally experience a \ntemperature window restricted to between \u20131.86\u00b0C and +1\u00b0C (from the \nRothera Time Series long term data set, provided by Professor A. Clarke). \n 4\nHSP_Invertebrate \n \nP. gibber is the largest Antarctic amphipod. It lives under stones in burrows in \nthe sediment and is predominantly a detrital feeder (Coleman, 1989). O. \nvalidus is ubiquitous and abundant in Antarctic waters with a circum-polar \ndistribution (McClintock et al, 1988). Although it is known as a predatory \nscavenger, it also gets much of its energy from detrital feeding (Pearse, \n1965). So these are both species that are positioned towards the top of the \nAntarctic marine food web and have different lifestyles to those Antarctic \nspecies already studied for their HSP response. \n  \nIn this study members of the HSP70 gene family comprising inducible \n(HSP70) members and GRP78, a related HSP70 family member were cloned \nusing degenerate PCR from P. gibber and O. validus. The expression of these \ngenes was surveyed via Q-PCR after an acute heat shock experiment in both \norganisms, and an additional time course experiment in O. validus. The data \nis discussed in the context of the organisms\u2019 evolutionary adaptation to life in \nan extreme environment, thermal tolerance and the applicability of HSP70 to \nmonitor thermal stress in Antarctic marine organisms. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5\nHSP_Invertebrate \nMethods \n \nAnimal sampling and experimental work  \n \nAll Odontaster validus (sea star) and Paracerodocus gibber (amphipod) used \nin experimental work were collected at Rothera Research Station, Adelaide \nIsland, Antarctic Peninsula (67o 34 \u05f307\u05f4  S, 68o 07 \u05f330\u05f4  W) by SCUBA divers \nduring the austral summer and returned to the British Antarctic Survey\u2019s \naquarium in Cambridge, UK. The animals were maintained throughout in a re-\ncirculating seawater aquarium at a mean water temperature of -0.7oC and a \n12:12 light:dark cycle.  \n \nO. validus and P. gibber were exposed to 100C (9.96\u00b10.05oC) and 150C \n(14.85\u00b10.05oC) for 2h (n=5\/species). Animals were directly transferred from -\n0.7oC to the elevated temperatures without an acclimation period. Separate \ncontrol groups (n=5\/species) of O. validus and P. gibber were also sampled \nfrom the aquarium. O. validus was also subjected to 2 time course \nexperiments at 20C (2.0\u00b10.05oC) and 60C (6.0\u00b10.02oC) for periods of 2, 6, \n12, 24, 48 and 168 hours each (n=4 at each time period).  \n \nSample Analysis \n \nRNA extraction and isolation of Heat Shock Protein (HSP) genes:  Total RNA \nwas extracted from whole body (P. gibber) and gonad (O. validus) using TRI \n 6\nHSP_Invertebrate \nReagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. 1\u03bcg of total \nRNA was DNAse treated using 0.4U DNase I (Ambion) in 10mM DTT\/100mM \nMgCl2 buffer and reverse transcribed using a first strand synthesis kit \n(Promega). Degenerate primers for HSP70 were designed from a protein \nalignment of HSP70 genes from a variety of species as described in Clark et al \n(2008a) (Table 1). PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 95\u00b0C 5 minutes, 35 \ncycles of 95\u00b0C 20 seconds, 45\u00b0C 20 seconds and 72\u00b0C for 40 seconds with a \nfinal elongation step of 72\u00b0C for 5 minutes with 40 cycles. Products were \nsubcloned into p-GEMT-easy (Promega), transformed into E.coli strain XL-2 \nBlue MRF\u2019 (Stratagene) and a minimum of 48 clones sequenced from each \nspecies. Sequence data was assembled using the phred, Phrap and consed \npackages  (Ewing et al, 1998; Gordon et al, 1998). Consensus sequences \nwere database searched using WU-blast2 (WU-blastx) (Altschul et al, 1997) \nagainst Uniprot (Boeckmann et al, 2003; Wu et al, 2006) to assign their HSP \nidentity. The nucleotide sequences were aligned using Clustal W (Thompson \net al, 1994) and specific primers designed to each different member of the \nHSP family for each species (Table 1), all with an annealing temperature of \n60\u00b0C. Amplified fragment sizes varied between 86bp and 146bp. The \nspecificity of each of the primers was checked, by amplification and \nsequencing of the products.  \n \n \nIsolation of \u03b2 actin genes: For comparative analysis to be made between the \ndifferent HSP genes, a housekeeping sequence (\u03b2 actin) was isolated from \n 7\nHSP_Invertebrate \nboth species. Degenerate primers were designed from a ClustalW alignment \nof a number of  \u03b2 actin genes as described in Clark et al (2008a) (Table 1). \nThe PCR conditions were as follows: 95\u00b0C 5 minutes, 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C 20 \nseconds, 45\u00b0C 20 seconds and 72\u00b0C for 40 seconds with a final elongation \nstep of 72\u00b0C for 5 minutes. PCR products were sequenced, assembled and \nchecked as described above for the HSP genes. Where multiple \u03b2 actin \nfragments were amplified from the same organism, primers were designed to \nregions of identity between the different family members. Primers were \ndesigned to anneal at 60\u00b0C. Expression levels of \u03b2 actin between different \ntissues and different treatment states were checked to ensure constant \nexpression and reproducibility.  \n \nThe HSP sequences described in this paper have been submitted to the EMBL \ndatabase with accession numbers AM408048 (O. validus, HSP70), AM408049 \n(O. validus, GRP78), AM408050 (P. gibber, HSP70A), AM408051 (P. gibber, \nHSP70B), AM408052 (P. gibber, HSP70C) and AM408053 (P. gibber, HSC70) \n \nQ PCR:  \nHSP and actin sequences were amplified from each organism under each \ntreatment condition using specific primers, Brilliant SYBR\u00ae Green QPCR \nMaster Mix (Stratagene) and an MX3000P Q-PCR machine (Stratagene). PCR \nconditions were as follows: 95\u00b0C 10 minutes, 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C 30 seconds, \n60\u00b0C 1 minute and 72\u00b0C for 1 minute with a final dissociation curve step as \nper manufacturers recommendations. The plate set-up for each Q-PCR \n 8\nHSP_Invertebrate \nexperiment consisted of 5 control individuals and 5 experimental (\u201ctreated\u201d) \nindividuals, both sets were amplified with a specific HSP primer pair and an \nactin control primer set.  All amplifications were reproduced in triplicate. Each \nprimer set was checked to ensure that no primer dimers were produced \nduring the course of the amplification reaction. RSq values and PCR \nefficiencies were checked over a four fold 10x dilution series and the values \ncalculated using the MxPro - MX3000P v 3.00 Build 311 Schema 74 software \n(Table 2). Primers producing low RSq values were discarded and new primers \ndesigned. Amplifications were analysed using the MxPro - MX3000P v 3.00 \nBuild 311 Schema 74 software and Ct (dR) values exported into Excel. \nRelative expression ratios of the HSP genes compared to the actin \nhousekeeping genes between the control and treated samples were derived \nusing the Relative Expression Software Tool (REST) (http:\/\/www.gene-\nquantification.info\/)  (Pfaffl 2001, Pfaffl et al 2002). This is an excel macro \nthat incorporates both a mathematical model to calculate relative expression \nratios on the basis of the PCR efficiency and crossing point derivation of the \ninvestigated samples and a two sided  Pair Wise Fixed Reallocation \nRandomisation Test. This test makes no assumptions about distribution (such \nas normality of distribution) and assumes that treatments were randomly \nallocated. The randomisation test repeatedly and randomly reallocates the \nobserved values to the two groups and notes the apparent effect (expression \nratio). The proportion of these effects, which are as great as that actually \nobserved in the experiment provides the p-value of the test. 2000 \nrandomisations were used in the test  (Pfaffl 2001, Pfaffl et al 2002). These \n 9\nHSP_Invertebrate \nresults were then followed by further statistical analysis  (MINITAB v 14) \nusing Fisher\u2019s test for combining probabilities (Fisher, 1954) and 2-way \nANOVA tests were run on the time course dataset to identify any effect of \neither gene, temperature or time.  \n \n \nResults \nFour different HSP gene family members were cloned from both P. gibber and \nO. validus. These were defined according to their sequence similarity scores \nafter searching the sequence databases using WU-blastx and comprised three \ninducible HSP70\u2019s and GRP78 (P. gibber) and one inducible HSP70 and GRP78 \n(O.validus) (Table 1). Specific primers for Q-PCR were successfully designed \nto all clones (Table 2). A further two clones were isolated from O. validus for \nanother inducible form of HSP70 and also HSC70, however in spite of \nrepeatedly testing different primers for these clones (30 potential primer \ncombinations for each) none worked effectively either in terms of \namplification, reproducibility or producing a linear relationship in a dilution \nseries and they were excluded from the analysis. To obtain a crude estimate \nof the relative expression levels of each of the HSP genes in each organism \nthe genes were assayed using PCR and gel electrophoresis with ethidium \nbromide staining  in a set of control animals (data not shown). Actin \nexpression, as expected, produced a strong signal in each species, but there \nwas no discernable expression of the HSP family members either in P. gibber \nor O. validus.  \n 10\nHSP_Invertebrate \n \nThe acute heat shock experiments at 10\u00b0C and 15\u00b0C showed no significant up \nregulation of HSP genes in either species (Figure 1). Application of Fisher\u2019s \nmethod for combining probabilities on each of the two species datasets is \nconsistent with no detectable effect of temperature on HSP gene expression \n(for values see figure legend). \n \nIn the O. validus time course experiment, at 2\u00b0C both GRP78 and HSP70 were \ndown regulated. With both genes there was a trend showing an initial \ndecrease in relative expression levels (-40 fold with GRP78 and \u20136.9 fold with \nHSP70), which over the period of the time course gradually returned to levels \napproaching those of the controls (Figure 2). The 6\u00b0C time course experiment \nshowed a different pattern with a non-significant level of up-regulation (cf. \nindividual p values) in relative gene expression level for both genes. 2-way \nANOVA testing on the combined 2\u00b0C and 6\u00b0C dataset identified an effect of \nboth temperature and time (temperature: DF = 1, F = 63.84, p = 0.000; \ntime: DF = 5, F = 4.34, p = 0.017), but no effect of the gene when tested \nagainst the variables of time and temperature (data not shown). \n \n \nDiscussion \n \nNeither P. gibber nor O. validus  showed any significant up-regulation of heat \nshock protein activity in the acute temperature challenges above the level of \n 11\nHSP_Invertebrate \nindividual variation\/experimental noise for any of the family members (Figure \n1). Whilst these are temperatures far in excess of those the animals would \nexperience in the Antarctic marine environment, previous laboratory based \nexperiments on L. elliptica and sub-tidal N. concinna have demonstrated the \nclassical heat shock response at 10\u00b0C (L. elliptica ) and 15\u00b0C (N. concinna) \n(Clark et al, 2008a). Hence there are Antarctic marine organisms that still \npossess the ability to up-regulate their HSP genes. Whether these genes are \nutilised in their natural environment, or the threshold level for induction is a \nremnant of a temperate ancestor remains to be determined and may become \nmore apparent as a greater number of species are surveyed. One such \nexample of related work on inter-tidal N. concinna has demonstrated the up-\nregulation of inducible forms of HSP70 (albeit to much lower levels than the \nlaboratory experiments) in response to emersion (Clark et al, 2008b). Clearly \nthe stresses imposed on inter-tidal animals are more complex, but this data \ndoes show that HSP70 genes, at least in N. concinna are induced by stresses \nin the natural environment and not merely a vestigial attribute from a \nphylogenetic history. That may be the situation with P. gibber and O. validus \nin that they have maintained a suite of HSP70 genes, but they may be \ninduced by different cellular perturbations. Although only one inducible form \nof HSP70 was surveyed in O. validus (sequence data indicated that other \nforms were present (Clark, unpublished)), results from the bivalve, L. elliptica \nand N. concinna, limpets, show that heat stress reproducibly induced all forms \nof HSP70 in the latter species (Clark et al, 2008a). Therefore results from a \nsingle inducible HSP70, in this experimental context, are potentially indicative \n 12\nHSP_Invertebrate \nof the generalised expression of multiple isoforms, where they exist. However \nvalidation will always required to define subtle differences in control between \nparalogous genes. \n \nIn the other main example of lack of a classical heat shock response, the \nAntarctic Notothenioids, have maintained HSP70 genes, but their expression \nmode has been altered from inducible to constitutive (Carpenter and \nHofmann, 2000; Hofmann et al, 2000; Place et al, 2004; Place and Hofmann, \n2005; Clark et al, 2007), unless like the limpets, these chaperones are \ninduced by other environmental stresses. A PCR-based survey of the HSP70 \ngenes in control animals of P. gibber and O. validus did not show constitutive \nexpression of any of the genes under study. This is in contrast to the work on \nthe Antarctic Notothenioids and the molluscs, where there is considerable \nconstitutive expression of HSP70, HSC70 and GRP78 (Place and Hofmann, \n2005; Clark et al, 2007, 2008a). This is thought to be due to an enhanced \nrequirement for chaperone proteins to help with the problems of protein \nfolding at low temperatures (Place et al, 2004). This requirement would not \nnecessarily appear to be present in all species, but again requires further \ninvestigation. \n \nThe results of the O. validus time course experiment are more complex \n(Figure 2). Again, the individual p values show no significance at the 95% \nConfidence Interval. Although there would appear to be a trend in the 2\u00b0C \nexperiment for an initial down-regulation of both genes, followed by a gradual \n 13\nHSP_Invertebrate \nreturn to \u201cnormal\u201d levels over the period of the week. This trend is validated \nby the ANOVA analysis, showing a combined effect of time and temperature. \nThe shape of the 2\u00b0C graphs mirror the results of a 6\u00b0C 48 hour time course \nexperiment in Harpagifer antarcticus  for both HSP70 gene family members \nand the warm acclimated protein (WAP65) (Clark et al, 2007; Clark and \nBurns, 2007). It has been proposed that initial down-regulation of certain \ngenes is due to the initial \u201cshock\u201d response followed by a return to equilibrium \nas these animals acclimate. Certainly Antarctic fish have been acclimated to \n+4\u00b0C (Carpenter and Hofmann, 2000; Lowe and Davidson, 2005; Jin and \ndeVries, 2006, Podrabsky and Somero, 2006) and H. antarcticus has spent \nseveral months at 3\u00b0C in the Rothera aquarium (Clark, unpub.). O. validus \nhas also been successfully acclimated to +6\u00b0C (Peck et al, 2008) and \nexperiments on larvae indicate a certain level of temperature tolerance \n(Stanwell-Smith and Peck, 1998; Peck and Prothero-Thomas, 2002), \nindicating that the fish and the sea star are some of the more robust Antarctic \nstenotherms (Peck et al, submitted). Why the shape of the 2\u00b0C graphs are \nnot mirrored in the 6\u00b0C experiments (with a lack of initial down regulation) is \nunknown. Even with this experiment, the longer timescale and higher \ntemperature does not invoke significant HSP expression, but given the data of \nPeck et al (submitted) where oxygen consumption and feeding in O. validus \nare not affected by 25 days at 6\u00b0C, this is perhaps not surprising.  \n \nThese two species (P. gibber and O. validus) expand the previous surveys \ninto the heat shock response of Antarctic marine organisms. The more \n 14\nHSP_Invertebrate \nspecies surveyed, the more complex the picture. There is now data on several \nfish species (Place and Hofmann, 2005; Clark et al, 2007), a filter feeding \nbivalve mollusc and a grazing gastropod mollusc (Clark et al, 2008a). We \nhave now added to this with data for a detritivore and a carnivore\/detritivore. \nThis encompasses a wide phylogenetic range, different feeding guilds and \nvariety in lifestyle. Not all species show permanent expression of inducible \nHSPs, not all species show the classical heat shock response and in at least \none case, multiple stressors can invoke HSPs at temperatures lower than that \ntested in the laboratory. This combined data shows that it will not be a simple \ntask to derive generalisations about the ability of Antarctic marine organisms \nto invoke the classic cellular first aid kit of HSP70 genes in response to \nelevated sea water temperatures or indeed the utility of HSPs as a biomarker \nfor stress in Antarctic waters. The results of the gene expression level surveys \nalso demonstrate that for a molecular biomarker (Antarctic or otherwise) to \nbe effective, the change in gene expression has to be large. The one-off \nsampling regime for \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d effects and the high inter-individual \nvariability of non-interbred, non-model organisms produces wide 95% \nConfidence Intervals with Q-PCR experiments (discussed in more detail in \nClark et al, 2007). Therefore biomarker gene expression levels must show a \nstrong signal above background variation in order for valid conclusions to be \ndrawn about perturbation effects. This provides problems when evaluating \nfield populations of non-model organisms when gene expression changes are \nmoderate or small. In conclusion, the data presented here show that the HSP \nresponse in the Antarctic has to be investigated on a species-specific basis. \n 15\nHSP_Invertebrate \nWider surveys are required to elucidate the most common response patterns, \nalong with investigation of the potential for different types of environmental \nperturbation to invoke HSP expression both in the laboratory and wild \npopulations. Also given these limitations, a wider range of genes should be \ninvestigated and EST libraries are currently in production within our laboratory \nfor a number of Antarctic invertebrates with the aim of targeting genes \ninvolved in the reaction to heat stress. \n \n \n 16\nHSP_Invertebrate \nReferences \n \nAltschul SF, Madden TL, Schaffer AA, Zhang JH, Zhang Z, Miller W, Lipman DJ \n(1997) Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: a new generation of protein database \nsearch programs.
