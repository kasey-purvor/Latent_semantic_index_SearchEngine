INTRODUCTION \nThe application of standard asset pricing theory dictates that the cross-section of expected stock \nreturns are related to returns sensitivities to state variables that are themselves linked to investors \noverall welfare (Pastor and Stambaugh, 2003).  Assets whose lowest returns accompany \nunfavourable shifts in that welfare must compensate investors for the loss of value while holding \nthe asset.  While Fama and French (1993) proposed that variations in size as well as differences \nbetween accounting book to market value of stocks across a universe of stocks as state variables \nthere is considerable recent evidence that liquidity is also such a state variable (Liu, 2006; Pastor \nand Stambaugh, 2003) that must be accounted for in pricing models.  The presence of size effects is \nespecially likely within smaller regional stock markets where the majority of listings arise either \nfrom occasional listings of larger internationally focussed firms or from indigenous small and \nmedium enterprises (SMEs) that play an active role in the localised regional political economy \n(Choe, 2007).  This dispersion in types of firm listing is also likely to lead to considerable \ndifferences between value and growth stocks generating a book-to-market effect (Fama and French, \n1993).  The presence of this in Tokyo stock exchange data is well documented (Chan et al, 1991; \nDaniel et al, 2001).  Additionally there are also likely to be large differences in liquidity between \nfirms within and between markets (Pastor and Stambaugh, 2003) which has also recently been \ndocumented in Tokyo stock exchange data (Chang et al, 2010).  Consequently this empirical study \ninvestigates whether size, book to market value and liquidity effects are priced.  As such I ask \nwhether differences in cross sectional expected returns can be better explained by fluctuations in \naggregate market size and liquidity effects as opposed to size and book to market factors alone. \n Liquidity as a concept is very hard to define largely because its representative \ncharacteristics transcend a number of transactional properties of markets including tightness, depth, \nresiliency (Lesmond, 2005) and information (O\u2019Hara, 2003).  The literature has traditionally been \nlimited in only employing constructs capturing only one dimension of a multidimensional \nphenomenon.  This typically centres on variants of the bid-ask spread (quoted or effective) in \nAmihud and Mendelsen (1986), the turnover measure of Datar et al. (1998), or measures relating to \nthe price impact arising from traded volume such as Amihud (2002) and Pastor and Stambaugh \n(2003).  However there is very little published research concerning measures capturing the trading \nspeed dimension of liquidity, defined as the ability to transact large quantities quickly with little \nprice impact (Liu, 2006; Pastor and Stambaugh, 2003).  Furthermore there are serious concerns \nover existing one-dimensional constructs ability to fully capture liquidity risk and over their \ninaccurate estimation of the dimension they are intended to model (Pastor and Stambaugh, 2003; \nAmihud, 2002).  Equally deficiencies in the application of the bid-ask spread construct have been \n 3 \nhighlighted in Lee (1993) where evidence reveals that many large trades occur outside the bid-ask \nspread while many small trades are undertaken within it leading to potential bias.  Further concerns \nover the application of one-dimensional measures focus on their being undefined in the presence of \nextremes of illiquidity as is a frequent occurrence in smaller regional markets (Lesmond, 2005).  A \nmore recent measure developed in Liu (2006) captures the trading speed dimension of liquidity \nwhich is defined as the standardized turnover-adjusted number of zero trading volumes over the \npast twelve months.  It is multi-dimensional in nature, capturing effects relating to trading speed, \ntrading quantity and trading cost, with an emphasis on trading speed, outlined as the continuity of \ntrading and the potential delay in executing an order (Liu, 2006).  An additional benefit from the \nuse of this measure arises from its measurement robustness in the presence of significant illiquidity \n(Liu, 2006)  as is often present in smaller regional markets although this has only been studied \nwithin the context of the developed market of the New York Stock Exchange. \n The literature concerning the inclusion of liquidity as a priced state variable within a \nvaluation framework is very recent.  Pastor and Stambaugh (2003) find strong evidence from US \nstock data that market-wide liquidity is a priced state variable and that the liquidity premium should \nbe positive.  The study applied the innovations of a price impact measure of liquidity to sort stocks \nwithin a universe into decile portfolios with the market aggregate premium being formed in the \ndifference between returns of the highest and lowest liquidity deciles.  The explanatory power \narising from inclusion of the liquidity factor were studied through the contrast of a four factor \ncapital asset pricing model (CAPM) including market, size, price-to-book value and the new \nliquidity factor against the Fama and French (1993) three factor model and the CAPM.  Stocks with \nhigher sensitivity to aggregate liquidity stocks compensate investors with higher expected returns.  \nEvidence is also found that small stocks have greater sensitivities to liquidity innovations than large \nstocks.  Pastor and Stambaugh (2003) note that intuitively it could be expected that small and \nilliquid stocks are those most affected by market aggregate drops in liquidity thereby precipitating \ninvestors to \u201cflee\u201d to assets with higher liquidity.  However their findings also show that size and \nliquidity are not the sole determinants of liquidity betas.  This finding is reinforced by the argument \nexplaining why stocks with a high liquidity beta are not necessarily illiquid.  Investor preferences \nwhen there are market aggregate falls in liquidity are also likely to focus on rival bonds markets.  In \norder to increase portfolio holdings in bonds investors may seek to sell liquid stocks in order to save \non transactions costs.  Consequently in this scenario the price reaction to aggregate liquidity \nchanges is stronger for more liquid stocks.  Equally prices of liquid stocks could have greater \nsensitivity to aggregate liquidity shocks if such stocks are held in greater proportions within the \nportfolios of liquidity-conscious investors.  As such Pastor and Stambaugh (2003) find little basis \nfor liquidity betas to bear a simple relation to stock size and liquidity.  Liu (2006) builds on this \nbackground in first using a new liquidity construct to estimate stock liquidity and then including \nthis factor within a two factor augmented capital asset pricing model (CAPM).  While the \n 4 \nadditional liquidity factor offers strong performance in explaining the cross section of US stock \nreturns the findings are in contradiction to the earlier findings of Pastor and Stambaugh as the \nliquidity premium solely subsumes the documented anomalies such as size and the book-to-market \neffects from Fama and French (1993).   \n The literature regarding liquidity in Japanese financial markets is almost exclusively \nfocussed on the Tokyo stock exchange (TSE).  Much of this earlier work has a distinctive market \nmicrostructure approach and studies the exchange design factors affecting the provision of liquidity, \nsuch as the presence of exchange-designated market makers using cross sectional methods \n(Lehmann and Modest, 1994) and dynamic time series methods (Hamao and Hasbrouck, 1995).  \nHowever extensions have been undertaken to examine the relationship between liquidity and \nreturns with a study of the relationship between weekly short-term stock returns and the previous \nweeks traded volumes (Bremer and Hiraki, 1999).  More recently an extensive examination of the \neffects of aggregate liquidity on stock returns across the first and second tiers and mothers board of \nthe TSE is undertaken in Chang et al (2010).  While this uses a range of liquidity constructs, such as \nthe price-impact measure of Amihud (2002), trading speed metric of Liu (2006) and several volume \nand price-rigidity measures (relating to number of zero trading days and zero daily returns) the \nstudy is limited to assessing the level of association between these measures and control variables \nthrough correlations.  The focus of the study is on the relationship between these measures, and the \nreturns-based factor they form in each case, and stock returns having taken into account a number \nof standard control variables between the TSE market segments and at different times of the \nJapanese business cycle.  A shortfall in this research is in the direct contrasting of these measures in \nexplaining the total trading costs, defined as the bid-ask spread plus the trading commission levied \nby exchange for both buy and sell sides of a trade.  Consequently I ask which of these measures \nbest explains total trading costs and use the most robust construct in forming liquidity valuation \nfactor to further assess the relationship between liquidity and stock returns. \n The current Japanese system of regional financial markets owes its existence to the post-\nWar 1949 establishment of nine (currently five) regional stock exchanges in major regional centres, \nalthough many had originally been formed much earlier to serve the financing needs of powerful \nlocalised interests within the distinctive regional political economy (Choe, 2007).  However despite \nthe importance of the local financial markets within Japan\u2019s regional economy there is little, if any \nresearch focussing on these exchanges.  This motivates my focus on the Japanese regional \nexchanges as well as the TSE while also considering the differences between the largest top bracket \nof stocks and the overall market which is an obvious source of potential segmentation. \n The majority of the valuation literature concerns the implementation of pricing models that \nassume a time invariant relationship in the systemic (market) risk of an asset.  However over the \nlast fifteen years a separate literature concerning the time varying nature of systemic risk has \nevolved from an increasing concerns of the violation of assumptions inherent in the linear model \n 5 \nsuch as normality, identity and independence of stock returns (Grout and Zalewska, 2006).  \nPettengill et al (1995) studied the relationship between risk and return in \u201cup\u201d as opposed to \n\u201cdown\u201d markets while Bekeart and Harvey (1995) undertook a similar study using Markov-\nswitching regressions across a broad sample of emerging markets to examine differences between \nperiods of integration with world market and segmentation.  Brooks et al (1998) used time varying \ntechniques based on the Kalman-filter approach and applied to Australian industry portfolios \nfinding that these techniques produced improved in and out of sample performances than other \neconometric techniques.  Grout and Zalewska (2006) find that the use of Kalman filter methods is \npreferable to Markov-switching regressions owing to their not having to define the exact point of \nthe switch (Grout and Zalewska, 2006).  Instead any changes in the time path of betas can be \nassessed through the study of regression results which is particularly relevant in the modelling of \nliquidity effects as these are prone to considerable fluctuation within emerging markets.  In the light \nof this evidence I use time varying techniques employing the Kalman filter framework following \nBrooks et al (1998). \n In this study I find evidence that the Amihud price-impact and multidimensional trading \nspeed Liu measures outperform the turnover metric in explaining total trading costs across the \nJapanese regional exchanges.  However the Amihud construct appears more robust in explaining \ntotal costs in the smaller more illiquid markets such as Sapporo while the Liu measure is preferable \nin the larger Osaka and Tokyo exchanges.  The evidence from time series analysis of returns from \nportfolios of both top tier stocks and the overall market where a traditional CAPM is contrasted \nagainst its augmented counterparts, with size and price-to-book value factors and size and liquidity \nfactors respectively indicate that the latter has a greater impact on explanatory power.  This finding \ntranscends all of the Japanese regional market portfolios for top tier stocks as well as the aggregate \nmarket.  These results add further support in a wider global markets context to the findings of the \nliterature, such as Liu (2006) and Pastor and Stambaugh (2003), in applications that solely focussed \non the US equity market.  It also adds credibility to the continued use of the mean-variance \nparadigm in valuation. \n The paper is structured as follows.  Section 2 reviews the institutional features of Japanese \nregional equity markets while section 3 outlines data sources before introducing the liquidity \nmeasures and their construction and finally descriptive statistics.  Section 4 outlines the two \nmodelling approaches used: the size and liquidity augmented CAPM and its time varying parameter \nanalogue.  Section 5 discusses the empirical results.  The final section concludes. \n \n2. JAPANESE REGIONAL MARKETS AND LIQUIDITY MEASUREMENT \n \n(i). Japanese securities markets \n 6 \nThe current network of regional stock exchanges throughout Japan was formally established in \n1949 following the end of the second World War, although many of the newly formed exchanges \nsubsumed older existing regional exchanges that had been in place since the late nineteenth century.  \nCurrently there are five exchanges, Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Fukuoka and Sapporo which have been \nshaped through a process of integration and consolidation.  Exchanges such as Kyoto were merged \ninto Osaka in 2001, Hiroshima and Niigata merged into Tokyo in 2000 and Kobe was dissolved in \n1967 (TSE website, 2009).  A new exchange to have been established in Japan is the Jasdaq, which \ninitially served only as an OTC market, but since 2004 has had exchange and trading facilities \nformalised.  The process of consolidation has continued during the millennium with the exploitation \nof economies of scale and scope through the joint establishment of the Japan Securities Clearing \nCorporation to facilitate clearing, settlement and payments amongst members of the national \nexchanges.  Furthermore the 2003 establishment of a common Japanese central depository, the \nJapan Securities Clearing Corporation (JSCC), generating even greater economies of scope and \nscale through facilitating inter-market settlements and causing the disbandment of expensive \nindividual clearing systems associated with each of the regional exchanges.  Study of the regional \nexchanges and their effect on the local political economy is greatly facilitated by their all sharing \nthe same legal regulatory regime, administered from Tokyo, stable common macroeconomic \nenvironment and homogeneous schedules of exchange commissions and fees. \n \nTokyo \nThe modern Tokyo stock exchange (TSE) traces it\u2019s origins to a much older Tokyo Stock Exchange \nCompany Ltd that was established in 1878.  This became the centre of the wartime Japan Securities \nExchange (\u65e5\u672c\u8a3c\u5238\u53d6\u5f15\u6240 Nippon Sh\u014dken Torihikisho), itself established in 1943 through the \nmerging of the then eleven regional Japanese stock exchanges.  This was dissolved in 1947 with the \ncurrent TSE being created in 1949 (TSE website, 2009).  Open outcry trading was replaced by an \nelectronic continuous auction system in 1999 and the exchange de-mutualised in 2001 changing its \nstatus from an incorporated association with its members as stakeholder (\u793e\u56e3\u6cd5\u4eba, shadan h\u014djin) \nto a joint stock corporation (TSE website, 2009).  Trading is remote and from 9am to 11am and 12-\n30pm to 15-00pm across the three market segments: the first and second tiers and the Tokyo \nMothers Board (\u201cMarket of high-growth and emerging stocks\u201d) which is the development market \n(TSE website, 2009).  Market barometer indices commonly used are the Nikkei 225 (Nikkei) which \nis the simple price-weighted average of top 225 Japanese stocks published by the Nihon Keizai \nShimbun (Nikkei) business journal as well as the TOPIX 100 and 500 which are the capitalization \nweighted average of stocks taken from first tier of TSE.  As would be expected from a large liquid \nmarket there is a relatively broad dispersion of capitalization and traded value across the TOPIX500 \n 7 \nstocks, although a significant proportion is concentrated in the top 100 stocks, as evident from \nTable 1. \nTable 1 \n \nOsaka \nThe Osaka stock exchange (OSE) is the second largest stock exchange in Japan and differentiates \nitself from Tokyo in specialising in derivative instruments.  The original Osaka financial market \nwas established formally in 1878 although it traces its origins to the 1600\u2019s where it was the centre \nof rice commodities trading and transactions were undertaken in a form of rice futures contract \n(OSE website, 2009).  Trading is electronic, in line with the TSE and operates similar hours.  The \nmarket is also segmented into three listings compartments with the Hercules being the development \nmarket for SME firms (OSE website, 2009).  The profile of the OSE (see Table 1) is similar to that \nof Tokyo with little concentration in capitalization and traded value, although as in the TSE most is \naccounted for by the top 100 stocks. \n \nNagoya \nThe Nagoya Stock Exchange (NSE) is the successor to the Nagoya Stock Exchange Co. Ltd., which \nwas founded in 1886.  It is the third largest exchange after Tokyo and Osaka and was de-mutualised \nin 2002.  Since 2000 trading has been by electronic continuous auction via N-NET with the same \nhours as the TSE and OSE (NSE website, 2009).  Equally alongside TSE and OSE the market has \nthree listings segments with Centrex being the development market for SME firms.  One of the \nmost significant challenges facing the exchange is the achievement of genuine diversification of \nshareholdings and the effective dismantling of a strong network of cross-holdings that is a \nprominent feature of the political economy of Japanese regions (NSE website, 2009).  The NSE has \na noticeably more concentrated profile than either the TSE or OSE with the one stock alone \naccounting for 12.62% of capitalization and 15.60% of traded value. \n \nFukuoka \nThe Fukuoka stock exchange was established in 1949 and central to the financing needs of the \nregional Kyushu economy (FSE website, 2009) and currently has over 100 local firms listed, \nthough many are only secondary listings.  The exchange is de-mutualised, in line with the general \ntrend in Japan, with electronic continuous auction trading operating similar hours to Tokyo, Osaka \nand Nagoya.  A development board was instigated in 2000, \u201cQ-Board\u201d, in order to make the \nexchange more accessible to the financing needs of the local business community, dominated by \nSME firms (FSE website, 2009).  The profile of the FSE, as intuitively expected for a very small \nregional market is heavily concentrated with 15.76% of capitalization and 13.33% of traded value \n 8 \nin one stock alone.  The top 5 stocks account for just under half the market capitalization (39.82%) \nand traded value (44.14%) (see Table 1). \n \nSapporo \nThe Sapporo stock exchange (SSE) was established in 1949 with 4 broker-member firms and 17 \nlocal listings.  Despite the general governance trend in Japan towards the de-mutualisation of \nexchange the SSE has retained it\u2019s original de-mutualised management structure and forms a \nprominent part of the local financing needs of the distinctive Japanese region of Hokkaido with a \ncurrent 77 listings, although only 22 are primary listed (SSE website, 2009).  Trading is in line with \nother Japanese exchanges, with similar hours and operating an electronic continuous auction and in \n2000 the SSE established it\u2019s own development board, the \u201cAmbitious\u201d market to better \naccommodate the financing needs of the local Hokkaido business community (SSE website, 2009).  \nIn line with the FSE the SSE has a heavily skewed profile with one stock alone accounting for \n22.80% of capitalization and 26.13% of traded value.  There is even greater concentration in the top \n5 stocks with 57.38% capitalization and 67.71% of traded value (see Table 1). \n \n(ii). Liquidity constructs \nThe Bid Ask spread and commission cost \nThe Bid Ask spread and commission cost:  The data on the end of month bid and ask quotes were \ncollected from Datastream.  The bid-ask spread is calculated using the average of the available \nmonthly quotes and incorporates at a minimum a single month\u2019s quote for that month.  The average \nbid-ask spread spanning the quarter is used for the estimate of the spread.  This procedure \nminimizes outlier problems and averages out the recording of either highs or lows in quotes \nresulting from monthly sampling.  Following Lesmond (2005) bid-ask spreads that exceed 80% are \ntrimmed as these are potentially errors.  The monthly quoted spread is defined as: \n2\/2\/\n2\/1\n11\n11\nMM\nMM\nMM\nMM\nM\nBidAsk\nBidAsk\nBidAsk\nBidAsk\nspreadQuoted   (1) \n In order to estimate the total trading transaction costs, the costs associated with a round \ntrade are added to the quoted spread for each month.  Although there is a sliding scale of exchange \nfees contingent on traded value, there are no fees on trades less than \u00a520 billion (TSE website, 2009).  \nGiven the focus of this study is on the smaller regional exchanges where there is less participation of \ninstitutional investors and hence smaller size trades I have assumed brokerage and exchange fees to be zero. \n \nTurnover \nDaily trading volume data and shares outstanding data was obtained from Datastream.  At first \nglance it is apparent that there is considerable variation in this measure on an intra-market basis.  \nThis reflects the substantial differences in both liquidity and turnover for many of the companies \n 9 \nwithin each market.  Any turnover statistics that exceed 100% of the shares outstanding in any \nmonth are trimmed from the sample.  The shares-outstanding is determined at the start of the year \nand remains constant for the 12 months thereafter.  The daily turnover measure is defined as: \nM\nt\ntM volumeD\n1\ngoutstandin-shares1       (2) \nwhere MD  is the number of days in the month, M. \n \nAmihud (2002) measure \nDaily price and volume data are sourced from Datastream.  The daily security prices are scanned \nfor data errors, omissions and delistings.  Following the procedure outlined in Lesmond (2005) the \nprices are used calculate daily returns.  To control for return outliers, a data error filter eliminates \ndaily prices that are +\/- 50% of the prior day\u2019s price and that day\u2019s price as well as previous day\u2019s \nprice are deleted from sample.  Equally if zero volume occurs on day t, then that day is deleted from \naverage.  Finally the measure is multiplied by 106 as undertaken in Amihud (2002) in order to \nprovide a common representation of measures and facilitate comparison.  The Amihud measure is \ndefined as: \nM\nt\ntttM VolumeiceRD\n1\nPr||1       (3) \n \nLiu (2006) measure \nDaily price and volume data are collected from Datastream.  The measure is derived from the recent \nwork of Liu (2006) and is defined as LMx which is the standardized turnover-adjusted number of \nzero daily trading volumes over the prior x months (x = 1, 6, 12) i.e. \nNoTD\nx\nLM x\n21\n  \nDeflator\novermonth turn1\/x \n + monthsprior x in  mesdaily volu zero ofNumber  (4) \n \nwhere x month turnover is the turnover over the prior x months, calculated as the sum of the daily \nturnover over the prior x months, daily turnover is the ratio of the number of shares traded on a day \nto the number of shares outstanding at the end of the day, NoTD is the total number of trading days \nin the market over the prior x months, and Deflator is chosen such that, \n1\n1\n0\nDeflator\nturnovermonthx         (5) \nfor all sample stocks\n1\n.  Given the turnover adjustment (the second term in brackets in first \nexpression), two stocks with the same integer number of zero daily trading volumes can be \ndistinguished: the one with the larger turnover is more liquid.  As such the turnover adjustment acts \nas a tie-breaker when sorting stocks based on the number of zero daily trading volumes over the \n                                                 \n1\n In line with Liu (2006) a deflator of 1,000 is used in constructing estimates for LM1 \n 10 \nprior x months.  Because the number of trading days can vary from 15 to 23, multiplication by the \nfactor (21x\/ NoTD) standardizes the number of trading days in a month to 21 which makes the \nliquidity measure comparable over time.  LM1 can be interpreted as the turnover-adjusted number \nof zero daily trading volumes over the prior 21 trading days, which is the approximate average \nnumber of trading days in a month.  The liquidity measure, LMx is calculated at the end of each \nmonth for each individual stock based on daily data.  Daily data is available for all markets across \nentire sample period. \n \n(iii). Data: Sources \nDaily stock closing, bid and ask prices, total number of shares outstanding, traded volumes, \ndividend per share in local currency and converted into UK\u00a3 were obtained for all markets from \nDatastream.  These data formed the basis of calculation of the daily return variance, or volatility, \nmarket capitalization, defined as total number of shares outstanding multiplied by daily closing \nprice, and various liquidity constructs.  The total returns series for each stock were sourced direct \nfrom Datastream for all markets.  Exchange rate and UK- Gilt\/Treasury yield data are sourced from \nDatastream.  The one-month UK-Gilt\/Treasury Bill yield rate represents the risk free rate although \nthis is adjusted to take account of monthly excess returns as opposed to the quoted equivalent \nannualised rates.  The conversion of the total returns series and prices into sterling and the use of \nUK - Gilt\/Treasury yield rate assumes long term parity between Japanese Yen and sterling.  Only \nstocks with a primary listing on the individual regional market were used.  All estimation was \nundertaken in an international currency, UK\u00a3 sterling, to achieve greater international \ncomparability with the literature. \n \n(iv). Data: Summary statistics relating to liquidity measures \nThe evidence from Table 2 shows that as expected the profiles of the largest top tier stocks are \nconsiderably different from the overall aggregate market, although these differences gradually \nbecome less pronounced in the smaller regional markets of Nagoya, Fukuoka and Sapporo.  The \nlargest stocks exhibit lower bid-ask spreads, with for example 0.0038 in TOPIX 100 as compared to \n0.07327 in TOPIX 500 constituents, and a similar movement in daily zero returns, with the top tier \nstocks having lower levels of inactivity and price-rigidity than the aggregate market, although this \nis less pronounced in the smaller regional markets to the extent of being reversed in Sapporo which \nis more a symptom of extremes of illiquidity across it\u2019s very low number of listings (22).  There is \nalso clear evidence of a size effect in all markets, with the mean cross sectional capitalizations of \nthe large top tier bracket being several orders of magnitude larger than the overall market. \nTable 2 \n \n 11 \nAn assessment of the correlations between the key variables affecting the bid-ask spread and \nliquidity is provided in table 3.  Given the variables have different measurement scales a non-\nprobability distribution limited correlation, the Spearman\u2019s rank, is used for the measurement of \nassociation.  In addition to the bid-ask spread and the three liquidity measurement constructs, \nturnover, Liu and Amihud variables, price, daily price return volatility, traded volume, and market \ncapitalization measures are introduced as control variables in line with those used in the \ninvestigations for price of trading immediacy undertaken by Stoll (2000).  The rationale for the \ninclusion of these variables is based on order processing and inventory considerations of traders, \nalbeit in a study undertaken by Stoll (2000) in the US equity market.  Increases in volume and firm \nsize increase the probability of locating a counterparty, thereby mitigating the risk of accepting and \nholding inventory risk.  The stock price volatility, in local currency terms, provides an indication of \nthe risk of adverse price changes of a stock placed on a trader\u2019s inventory, while the price measure \nitself controls for the effect of discreteness and is an additional proxy for risk in that low price \nstocks tend to be riskier.  In this light the Liu metric is significantly, as indicated by correlations of \nover 50%, negatively correlated with traded volume and turnover across all markets as would be \nexpected given these variables play a significant role in it\u2019s construction.  Similarly traded volume \nis positively correlated with the turnover metric, which is intuitive given the role of the former in \nthe construction of he latter, for all markets bar Nagoya where it is only marginally insignificant.  \nUniquely traded volume has a large positive correlation with capitalization, or firm size, for only \nthe two smallest and most illiquid markets, namely Fukuoka and Sapporo.  This would indicate that \ninvestor confidence resides in larger well known stocks in the presence of a lack of diversification \nopportunities and extremes of illiquidity.  Market capitalization, or firm size, is also positively \ncorrelated to the Amihud metric for the all markets except the smallest, most illiquid, Sapporo.  The \ncorrelations in the Sapporo market are unique, largely owing to its very small size and illiquidity.  \nCorrelations between liquidity constructs and other control variables, while in line with those of the \nother regional markets, are significantly stronger.  A prominent example are the correlations \nbetween Liu and every other variable and metric except for the Amihud measure which is more an \nindication that when the little activity there is occurs then it is likely to affect all variables equally \nrather than being a true measure of illiquidity. \nTable 3 \n \n3. EMPIRICAL MODELS \nThis section considers two conditional modelling strategies, namely the three-factor linear CAPM \nand its time varying parameter counterpart. \n \n(i). Size and Liquidity Augmented CAPM \n 12 \nThe standard Fama and French (1993) model augments the traditional CAPM with size (SMB) and \nprice to book value (PBV) returns-based factors that proxy the hypothesized underlying state \nvariables.  Therefore, the expected excess returns on a portfolio p of emerging market stocks can be \nwritten as \nPBVhSMBEsrrErrE iiftmtpftpt   (6) \nThe equilibrium relation of the three factor model is stated in terms of expected returns. In order to \ntest the model with historical data, it is necessary to transform (6) to the following estimating \nequation: \nittitiftmtiiftit PBVhSMBsrrrr )(   (7) \nwhere the variables are described above and it  is an independently identically distributed (iid) \ndisturbance term.  Furthermore and following in the spirit of the above Fama and French model I \naugment the one-factor CAPM with size (SMB) and liquidity (ILLIQ) factors in order to create a \nsize-liquidity three factor model in line with Shum and Tang (2005) and Martinez et al (2005).  \nTherefore, the expected excess returns on a portfolio p of emerging market stocks can be written as \nILLIQhSMBEsrrErrE iiftmtpftpt   (8) \nIn line with the above this can be transformed in order to test historical data into the following \nequation: \nittitiftmtiiftit ILLIQhSMBsrrrr )(   (9) \nwhere the variables are described above and it  is an independently identically distributed (iid) \ndisturbance term.  The model is estimated on a time series basis using standard Ordinary Least \nSquares (OLS) techniques, as opposed to the Fama and Macbeth (1973) rolling cross section \napproach, with the expectation that the Jensen alpha, or regression intercept, should not be \nstatistically different from zero given the theoretical relationship between an individual portfolios \nexpected returns and those of the market (Markowitz, 1959).  However Scholes and Williams (1977) \nprovide evidence against the employment of standard OLS techniques with findings that beta \nestimations are biased downwards for securities infrequently trading and upwards for those traded \nmore often.  Dimson (1979) builds on this evidence in the inefficiency of beta estimation in thinly \ntraded stocks and proposes a correction technique based on the aggregation of betas from lagged \nand leading regression coefficients.  Dimson and Marsh (1983) propose a second correction \ntechnique which uses a trade-to-trade method measuring and matching returns between individual \nstocks or portfolios and the market index between the times of the last trades in successive months.  \nI justify the use of standard OLS techniques here in order to closely follow the literature of Pastor \nand Stambaugh (2003), Liu (2006) and Martinez (2005) who use these techniques extensively in \ntheir studies involving multifactor CAPM models capturing liquidity effects.  However the \n 13 \nlimitations of standard OLS techniques must be taken into account particularly when they are \napplied to the very small and illiquid markets such as Fukuoka and especially Sapporo. \n \n(ii). Time varying parameter CAPM model \nFollowing Brooks et al (1998) the time varying parameter analogue of the linear CAPM employs \nthe Kalman filter and relies on the notion of \u201cstate space\u201d in estimating the conditional constant \nterm and market beta of the multifactor analogue of CAPM.  This is represented by an observation, \nor measurement\/signal, equation and a transition, or state, equation, that in combination express the \nstructure and dynamics of a time varying system.  A state space model is specified where an \nobservation at time t is a linear combination of a set of variables, known as state variables, which \ncompose the state vector at time t.  Assuming the number of state variables is m and the (m x 1) \nvector is \u03b8t then the observation equation can be represented by: \n),0(~, 2Nzy ttttt     (10) \nwhere tz  is assumed to be known (m x 1) vector, and t  is the observation error.  The disturbance \nt  is assumed to be normally distributed with zero mean.  The set of state variables is defined from \nthe minimum set of information from past and present data and future values of time series are \ncompletely determined by the present values of the state variables, known as the Markov property.  \nThe state space model incorporates unobserved variables within, and estimates them alongside the \nobservable model, in imposing a time varying structure of the CAPM beta.  The conditional betas \nare estimated using the following observation, or signal equation: \n),0(~, NILLIQhSMBsRR tt\nKalman\ni\nKalman\niMt\nKalman\nittit  (11) \nwhere Rit and RMt are the excess returns of individual portfolio and market portfolios at time t and \nt  is disturbance term.  The exact form of the related transition equation depends on the form of \nstochastic process the betas are assumed to follow and in this case a simple random walk process is \nimposed as outlined in Brooks et al (2000).  The transition equation is defined: \n ),0(~,1 QNtt\nKalman\nit\nKalman\nit     (12) \n ),0(~,1 QNtt\nKalman\nit\nKalman\nit     (13) \n ),0(~,1 QNss stst\nKalman\nit\nKalman\nit     (14) \n ),0(~,1 QNhh htht\nKalman\nit\nKalman\nit     (15) \nTogether equations 11 and the combination of 12 to 15 constitute a Kalman filter state space model.  \nHowever a set of prior conditional values are necessary for the Kalman filter to forecast the future \nvalue and is expressed as: \n ),(~ 000 PN\nKalmanKalman\n      (16) \n 14 \n ),(~ 000 PN\nKalmanKalman\n      (17) \n ),(~ 000 PsNs\nKalmanKalman\n      (18) \n ),(~ 000 PhNh\nKalmanKalman\n      (19) \nBrooks et al (1998) cite that this technique uses the first two observations to establish the prior \nconditions and then recursively estimates the entire series providing conditional estimates of \nKalman\nit ,\nKalman\nits ,\nKalman\nith  and \nKalman\nit . \n \n4. RESULTS \n(i) An assessment of liquidity measures ability in explaining total costs \nThe regression results are reported in Table 4 for the five Japanese regional markets which are at an \noverall level with the TOPIX 500 being used for Tokyo.  In all cases, except Tokyo, the sign of the \nmarket control variables is of the expected direction i.e. negative for price and volume and positive \nfor size and volatility which is in line with theory (Stoll, 2000; Lesmond, 2005).  Tokyo is \nexceptional where volatility is negative although alongside volume it is not statistically significant.  \nSimilarly in the smaller illiquid regional markets of Nagoya and Sapporo size is negative while also \nbeing not statistically different from zero which is a noticeable departure from theory.  The \nexplanatory power of the regression models is good with R2 of over 90% evident for Tokyo and \nprogressively decreasing to 62% for Nagoya and then lower still at over 37% for Osaka, 34% for \nSapporo and 30% for Fukuoka. \n The results for the sequential addition of additional liquidity measures alongside the Stoll \ncontrol variables indicate that either the turnover or Liu metrics have the greatest impact for Tokyo, \nalthough this is largely indiscernible on the basis of increased explanatory power and can only be \ndifferentiated by statistical significance of this variable once included.  The inclusion of the \nAmihud and Liu constructs in regression models for Osaka also only result in slightly increased \nexplanatory power while the variables themselves are highly statistically significant.  The results \nfor Nagoya and Fukuoka are ambiguous given no additional liquidity construct results in increased \nexplanatory power and none are statistically significant.  However the addition of the Amihud \nconstruct to regressions for Sapporo results in considerable increases in explanatory power and also \nthe statistical significance of this variable.  These results would indicate at this stage that the \nAmihud variable is most suitable variable to measure liquidity although given the levels of \nambiguity present they are far from conclusive. \nTable 4 \n \n(ii). Contrasting the liquidity measures:  Vuong likelihood ratio test \n 15 \nThe maximum likelihood method of Vuong (1989) (see Appendix 1 for description of empirical \nmethods employed) offers a robust alternative to regression-based methods that merely test the \nlevel of association between the Stoll market control variables and the various liquidity constructs \nagainst the total trading costs with relative strength being assessed on the basis of statistical \nsignificance and explanatory power.  The tests proposed in Vuong (1989) use a one-sided Z-\nprobability distribution to assess the confidence levels arising from the study of which liquidity \nmeasures better explain the data generating process behind the total trading costs. \n The evidence from Table 5 indicates that the Stoll market control variables are better at \nexplaining the underlying total trading costs data generating process than either the Liu or Amihud \nliquidity constructs.  However the turnover measure does not offer a viable alternative as both Liu \nand Amihud measures are significantly better at explaining total trading costs.  There is very little \nevidence to clearly distinguish the performance of Liu over and above that of Amihud and thus \nmake a unambiguous decision regarding the robustness of one particular metric above all others.  In \nthis light I choose the Liu measure for modelling liquidity in next sections owing to its ability to \ntranscend the multidimensional properties of liquidity, where both the alternative measures are only \nable to capture single-dimensional effects of the liquidity phenomenon. \nTable 5 \n \n(iii). Summary statistics relating to size-liquidity sorted portfolios \nTable 6 presents the descriptive statistics for the nine size \u2013 liquidity sorts portfolios and separately \nthe nine size \u2013 price-to-book value sorted portfolios, with the latter representing the process \ninvolved in obtaining the factors for the Fama and French (1993) valuation model.  Generally the \nmean returns in panels A and B are positive while skewness and kurtosis are minimal indicating \nthat the distribution of returns conforms to a standard Normal distribution which is further \nreinforced by the very low Jarque-Bera statistics.  However there are some discernable differences \nacross the portfolios.  Evidence from panel A shows that returns are consistently lower for high \nilliquidity portfolios than for those of low illiquidity which is matched in reverse by higher standard \ndeviations, or volatility, for the former and lower standard deviation for the latter.  This is reversed \nfor the size-to-price to book value sorted portfolios in panel B.  Returns are lower for high price-to-\nbook value portfolios than for those with a low ratio and correspondingly standard deviations are \nlower for high price-to-book value than for low.  The dispersion of stocks across portfolios that \noccurred during the size-liquidity\/ price-to-book value sorting process is evident from panel C.  \nTokyo stocks are overwhelmingly concentrated in the big size portfolios, spanning across liquidity \ncategories, while those spilling over into the medium size portfolios are largely concentrated in the \nhigh illiquidity portfolio (53.82) with far fewer in the low liquidity portfolio (40.81).  Osaka stocks \nare overwhelmingly concentrated in the three small size portfolios with those falling in the medium \nsize portfolio being evenly distributed across liquidity categories, unlike previously in Tokyo.  \n 16 \nSimilarly Nagoya stocks fall in the three small size portfolios and then a lesser number in the \nmedium size portfolios though with the majority falling in the low illiquidity categories.  The very \nsmall markets of Fukuoka and Sapporo are quite different.  Numbers are much smaller and while \nthey are concentrated in the small and then medium size portfolios in both in Fukuoka these are \nconcentrated in the medium illiquidity category, while in Sapporo they are polarised between high \nand low illiquidity with none falling in medium illiquidity. \nTable 6 \n \nThe evidence from panel D shows that there is little correlation between the returns-based factors, \nMARKET, SMB, ILLIQ and PBV.  This is in line with theory (Pastor and Stanbaugh, 2003) where \nzero cost portfolios proxying underlying state variables should have little or no correlation which \nalso mitigates concerns over potential multicollinearity from their inclusion ion regression-based \nmodels such as the time series augmented CAPM.  However the negative values of mean returns of \nthe SMB, PBV and ILLIQ factors imply the likely presence of reverse size effects from that in \nFama and French (1993) where returns steadily decrease as stock size increases. \n The descriptive statistics of the portfolios constituting the largest top tier brackets of stocks \nas well as overall aggregate markets also reveal substantial differences between markets.  Mean \nreturns are exclusively negative for all the smaller regional Japanese markets, i.e. Nagoya overall, \nFukuoka and Sapporo.  However differences in standard deviations are negligible and both \nskewness and kurtosis statistics indicate that returns distributions conform to a standard Normal \ndistribution.  The presence of negative excess returns would question the viability of the smaller \nexchanges in terms of being able to attract long term institutional investors which would suggest \nthat there is an alternative motivation behind Japan\u2019s distinctive regional stock exchanges such as to \nserve the interests of the local political economy. \n \n(iv). Performance of traditional CAPM against three-factor CAPM \nTable 7 documents the results from the time series regressions of the traditional CAPM and the two \nsets of three factor augmented CAPM, namely the size \u2013 liquidity CAPM and size \u2013 price-to-book \nvalue CAPM.  The evidence would suggest that while there is an increase in explanatory power \nbetween the traditional CAPM and it\u2019s three factor counterpart there is actually little discernable \nbenefit between the addition of the liquidity or the price-to-book value factors.  The Jensen alpha, \n\u03b1p, terms in both the traditional CAPM as well as its three factor counterpart are not statistically \ndifferent from zero, indicating a good fit with theory (Markowitz, 1959) and also providing \nevidence of asset market integration and a lack of segmentation across the equity markets in Japan \nwhich would be expected from a homogeneous macroeconomic, legal and regulatory environment \nand payments system.  In all cases, bar the small size \u2013 medium illiquidity portfolio, the size, \nliquidity and price-to-book value factors are statistically significant although there is considerable \n 17 \ndispersion in the absolute size of the coefficients (betas).  Those of the big and small size portfolios \nare large, demonstrating the importance of size premiums in explaining returns, while those on the \nbig size portfolios within the size \u2013 price-to-book value portfolios are negative indicating the \npresence of a reverse size effect where returns for the largest stocks actually decrease as firm size \nincreases.  This behaviour is not expected and is indicative of a reversal of the documented \u201csize \neffect\u201d that effects the valuation of smaller firms (Martinez et al, 2005).  This is the opposite of \nwhat would be expected and does not provide investors with good hedging opportunities.  The betas \non the high illiquidity\/ price-to-book value portfolios across each of the three size categories are \npositive indicating the presence of a reverse illiquidity effect, where returns actually increase as \nilliquidity increases and as price-to-book value increases.  Thus, as with the results for the small-\nsize portfolios, a different valuation method would be needed to price very high illiquidity stocks \nand firms accurately.  The estimated coefficients on the illiquidity factor-mimicking portfolios are \nnegative for low and medium-illiquidity portfolios indicating as expected that more liquid firms \nexperience a decrease in expected returns when aggregate market illiquidity increases.  In general, \nthe coefficients on the low-illiquidity and medium-illiquidity portfolios are negative, as one would \nexpect, with firms paying lower returns when the illiquidity variable increases.  However, the \ncoefficients on the high-illiquidity portfolios are positive indicating that these companies pay higher \nreturns when the illiquidity measure increases.  The increased explanatory power of these models \nillustrates that the size-liquidity augmented CAPM is appropriate for a range of markets although it \noffers only a marginal improvement over and above the Fama and French (1993) size \u2013 price-to-\nbook value counterpart.  As a result and in order to achieve brevity at this stage I omit further study \nof the Fama and French model and focus my study retaining the size \u2013 liquidity factors. \nTable 7 \n \n(v) Modelling market portfolios \nCountry and industry portfolios were formed from the simple price-weighted averages of stock \nreturns across stocks aggregated into either industries or countries.  The time invariant CAPM, size-\nilliquidity and size-price-to-book value augmented CAPM models were applied to the portfolios \nwith results reported in Table 8. \n \nAverage Returns in Tokyo \nThe results for the top tier TOPIX100 and overall TOPIX500 index constituents indicate a good fir \nwith theory given all Jensen alpha terms are not statistically significant, size betas are positive, \nlarge and statistically significant and liquidity betas are negative while statistically significant.  \nHowever while both size and liquidity factors are significant and lead to increased explanatory \npower in TOPIX100 portfolio the addition of the size term in the TOPIX500 portfolio causes the \nJensen alpha to become statistically significant despite the increase in R2, indicating a lack of fit \n 18 \nwith prevailing theory and that these stocks are segmented from the market universe.  A two factor \nmodel, including only the liquidity factor, is preferable in explaining returns for TOPIX500 firms, \nwhere explanatory power is increased but the Jensen alpha remains insignificant. \nTable 8 \n \nAverage Returns in Osaka \nThe results for the Osaka Top 50 stocks portfolio indicate that the Jensen alpha is statistically \nsignificant for all models inferring low levels of integration with the Japanese market universe.  \nHowever the size betas are negative and significant inferring the presence of a reverse size effect \nwhere returns decrease as firm size increases.  The liquidity betas are negative but also not \nsignificant and their addition does not cause any increase in explanatory power inferring that the top \nstocks alone can be modelled using a two factor model including size premiums.  In contrast the \nresults for the overall Osaka market indicate that Jensen alphas are not significant for any of the \nmodels while the addition of both the size and liquidity betas cause increases in explanatory power \nand are relevant in explaining returns. \n \nAverage Returns in Nagoya \nThe inclusion of either the size or liquidity factor alone causes the explanatory power of the model \nto increase for the portfolio of the top 20 stocks in Nagoya, although the latter has the greatest \nincrease resulting in an R2 of 82.66%.  Contrastingly the addition of both size and liquidity factors \nleads to the highest explanatory power, with an R2 of 92.30%, for the overall Nagoya market.  In \nboth the top tier stocks and overall market size betas are negative, indicating a decrease in returns \nas firm size increases, and liquidity betas are both large and positive indicating a large liquidity \neffect where returns increase alongside illiquidity.  This is evidence of the limitations of the CAPM \nmethodology when applied to smaller and more illiquid markets such as Nagoya. \n \nAverage Returns in Fukuoka and Sapporo \nThe evidence would suggest that returns in Fukuoka, one of the two smallest regional markets, are \nlargely driven by a large, positive and significant liquidity premium, given that in both the top 10 \nportfolio and in the overall market the addition of the liquidity factor alone leads to the highest R2 \n(49.79% for top 10 and 68.59% for overall).  The Jensen alpha term of all models is not statistically \nsignificant indicating a lack of segmentation with the Japanese market universe which is in line \nwith theory. \n \nAverage Returns in Sapporo \nThe results for Sapporo are similar to Fukuoka and Nagoya.  Both size and liquidity betas are \nsignificant and lead to an increase in explanatory power.  However while the addition of the \n 19 \nliquidity factor alone in the top 5 stocks portfolio leads to an R2 of 35.41% the combination of size \nand liquidity factors in the overall market causes an R2 of 57.52%.  In line to both Fukuoka and \nNagoya liquidity betas are large and positive and size betas are negative questioning the validity of \nthe CAPM in such small markets. \n \n(iv) Modelling industry portfolios with time varying techniques \nThe time varying coefficient model based on the augmented CAPM was only estimated including \nmarket, size and illiquidity factors.  There is contrast between the evidence in Table 9 and from the \nprevious section with a notable failure to achieve maximum likelihood convergence for the overall \nNagoya market.  Equally the time series means of liquidity betas are generally negative, as would \nbe expected inferring that increases in aggregate illiquidity lead to decreases in returns.  However \nwith the exception of Tokyo\u2019s TOPIX100 and Sapporo\u2019s Top 5 size betas are negative and in line \nwith the evidence from previous section.  These results would provide some support that illiquidity \nfactor does have an important role in valuation using this time varying methodology. \nTable 9 \n \nFigures 1 to 3 provide time series plots of the evolution of the liquidity betas across the overall \nmarket portfolios for those markets where maximum likelihood convergence was achieved using \nthe Kalman filter methodology.  The evidence from these figures reveals that there has been a \nconsiderable increase in the size and significance (shown by the lower standard error band \nbecoming positive) for liquidity betas in the overall markets of Sapporo and Fukuoka since the \nonset of the global financial crisis of 2007\/2008.  Tokyo\u2019s TOPIX500 in contrast is relatively \nunaffected with no discernable change in it\u2019s long term trend.  This would infer that as investor \nconfidence in assets perceived to be more risky and illiquid decreased worldwide liquidity was lost \nfrom smaller exchanges to larger deeper markets. \nFigures 1 - 3 \n \n(iv) Costs of equity estimation \nThe evidence from Table 10 reveals that costs of equity are lowest in the top bracket of stocks \nacross all markets, as would be expected.  However the time invariant regression methods indicate \nthat the smallest markets of Sapporo and Fukuoka have the highest costs of equity while the larger \nmore liquid markets of Tokyo and Osaka have the lowest.  While this progression in costs of equity \nis generally followed for the time varying method in the top stocks bracket, it is somewhat reversed \nin the overall markets with Fukuoka, Tokyo TOPIX500 and Sapporo having the lowest values \n(7.21%, 7.53% and 8.00% respectively) and Osaka the highest (10.23%). \nTable 10 \n \n 20 \n5. CONCLUSIONS \nThis study proposes a size and liquidity augmented capital asset pricing model to explain the cross \nsection of expected returns in Japanese regional stock markets, an area which has previously been \nexcluded from empirical research in finance.  The major international exchanges of Tokyo and \nOsaka are used alongside the much smaller Nagoya, Fukuoka and Sapporo markets that play a very \nprominent role in the financing needs of Japan\u2019s powerful localised political economy. \n The performance of the size and liquidity augmented three factor CAPM is contrasted with \nthe size and price-to-book value three factor model proposed in Fama and French (1993) and is \nfound to offer only marginal improvements in explanatory power across the cross section of stock \nreturns.  However the application of time varying techniques, employing the market, size and \nliquidity factors used in the time invariant CAPM regressions do reveal that the smaller regional \nmarkets of Fukuoka and Sapporo have experienced a considerable increase in absolute size and \nsignificance of their exposures to aggregate Japanese illiquidity which is not apparent in the larger \nTokyo market since the onset of the 2007\/2008 global financial crisis.  Equally returns in the \nsmaller markets of Nagoya, Fukuoka and Sapporo are driven by a considerable liquidity premium \nwhich is reflected in higher costs of equity inferring that these exchanges are not as competitive as \nthe larger Tokyo and Osaka exchanges for sourcing cost effective finance.  This in turn would \nexplain the high level of secondary listings on the smaller markets and their comparative inability to \nattract new primary listings. \n \n 21 \nREFERENCES \nAmihud, Y., 2002.

\nThis table presents the results of the Vuong (1989) likelihood ratio test for non-nested model selection for each market.  The models compared are based on the regressions of \nthe bid-ask spread and Amihud measure, defined in Amihud (2002), Turnover, defined as a ratio of the traded volume of shares in relation to total number of shares \noutstanding and is scaled by the number of trading days in the month of measurement, Liu measure of liquidity, of Liu (2006) representing a standardized turnover-adjusted \nnumber of zero returns over the prior month.  Natural logarithms are taken of Traded Volume, price, and market capitalisation variables which in addition to the volatility \nmeasure, defined as monthly average of daily stock returns, represent the underlying set of explanatory variables in Stoll (2000).  A Z-statistic, using a one sided probability, \nis the basis of determining if the Amihud estimate or Turnover (the reference model) is better at explaining the true bid-ask spread data generating process than alternative \nliquidity proxies, or the comparison models tested either singularly or as a group.  The group contains all the competing liquidity measures excluding the reference estimate.  \nA positive and significant Z-statistic indicates that the comparison models are rejected in favour of the reference model.  These cases are in bold type.

Vuong likelihood ratio test \nFollowing Lesmond (2005) a likelihood ratio test is used that was originally proposed by \nVuong (1989).  This is specific for non-nested model selection in testing whether a reference \nmodel and comparison model do equally well at explaining the underlying data.  The \nreference model is either the Amihud measure (Amihud 2002) or alternatively the Turnover \nmeasure, which is a measure of trading frequency, and the comparison models are the \nremaining liquidity measures, i.e. Liu derived from Liu (2006) and the liquidity determinants \nof Stoll (2000).  Each of the comparison models are tested independently against the reference \nAmihud or Turnover measure with each individual regression stated as: \n \nReference Model: S + Cj = \u03b80 + \u03b81 (reference liquidity measurej) + \u03b5j,  (8) \nComparison Model 1: S + Cj = \u03b30 + \u03b31 other liquidity measure(s)j + \u03b5j, and  (9) \nComparison Model 2: S + Cj = \u03b30 + \u03b31 pricej + \u03b32 volumej + \u03b33 \u03c3j\n2\n + \u03b34 sizej + \u03b5j,  (10) \n \nwhere S + Cj refers to the average, proportional bid ask spread plus commission cost for each \nfirm-month j within each country.  The comparison liquidity measures are those of Liu (2006).  \nPrice is the average annual daily stock price in local currency, and volume is the average \nannual daily trading volume.  \u03c3j\n2\n is the daily average volatility.  Size is the monthly market \ncapitalization and is defined as the share price times the number of shares outstanding.  Share \nprice is measured at the beginning of each month, while number of shares outstanding is \nmeasured at the beginning of the year. \n The basis of the test is a likelihood ratio of the log likelihood function for the \nreference model to the log likelihood function for the comparison model.  Using R to \nrepresent the reference model and C to represent the comparison model: \nn\ni\nni\nniC\nn\nR\nnn\nZCSg\nZCSf\nLLLR\n1 \u02c6;|\n\u02c6;|\nlog\u02c6\u02c6\u02c6,\u02c6 ,    (11) \nWhere LRn is the likelihood ratio function for n firm-month observations in each country.  Zi \nis a vector of m independent standard normal variables, n\n\u02c6  is the maximum likelihood \nparameter estimates for the reference model, and n\u02c6  is the maximum likelihood parameter \nestimates for the comparison model.  The variance of the likelihood function is given by \nVuong as \n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n222\n2\n1\n\u02c6\u02c62\n1\n]\u02c6log\u02c6[log\n2\n11\n\u02c6\nn\nn\nj\nR\nRj\nC\nCj\nRCn LR\nn\n   (12) \n 39 \nwhere \u03b5 is the residual using the fitted parameters for either the Amihud regression case of the \ncomparison model case.  Vuong shows that the likelihood ratio statistic converges to a normal \ndistribution: \nUnder H0  :  )1,0(\n\u02c6\n\u02c6,\u02c6\n2\n2\/1 N\nLR\nn\nD\nn\nnnn       (13) \nThe resultant test statistic is stated as \nn\nnnnLR\nn\nZ\n\u02c6\n\u02c6,\u02c61\n         (14) \nA one-sided Z-statistic tests whether either of the reference models, in this case being either \nthe Amihud or Turnover measure, is more highly associated with the underlying S + C cost \nthan the comparison model(s).  The test is directional, given by a positive or negative Z-\nstatistic, indicating which model is more highly associated with the underlying S + C cost.  A \npositive and significant Z-statistic indicates that the reference measure is more highly \nassociated with the underlying S + C cost than the comparison measure(s).  A negative and \nsignificant Z-statistic indicates the comparison measure is more highly associated with the \nunderlying S + C cost. \n Alternatively, the Z-statistic can be obtained from a linear regression if the log ratio is \ndefined at every month j as \n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u02c6\u02c62\n1\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\nlog\n2\n1\nR\nRj\nC\nCj\nR\nC\njm        (15) \nVuong states that a useful abstraction of the test statistic in above equation \u201c\nn\nnnnLR\nn \u02c6\n\u02c6,\u02c61  is \nnumerically equal to [(n-1)\/n]\n1\/2\n times either the usual t-statistic on the constant term in a \nlinear regression of mj on only the constant term, or the usual t-statistic on the coefficient of \nmj in a linear regression of one on mj.\u201d  Stated another way, the Z-statistic can be obtained by \nregressing mj on unity and multiplying the t-statistic from this regression by [(n-1)\/n]\n1\/2\n.  This \nprocedure involving the running of two subsequent sets of regressions is employed in this \npaper. \n \n"}
