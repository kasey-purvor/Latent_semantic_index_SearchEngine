INTRODUCTION \nPresent communication networks are dominated by data \ntraffic such as WWW and Email, which are bursty in nature. \nThey possess different burst length distributions compared to \ntraditional Exponential traffic models. For example in the case \nof WWW browsing with Pareto distributed burst lengths \nresulting infinite variance causes the undesirable queuing \nbehaviour exhibiting self similarity at the aggregate level. Once \nthese distributions are compared they exhibit a wide range of \nvariation in first and second order characteristics such as mean \nand standard deviation. This affects the queuing performance \ncharacteristics opposed to the traditional traffic [I]. Thus more \naccurate and efficient performance can be obtained using \ndynamic resource allocation techniques. \nThe admission control and scheduling mechanisms \nimplemented for Exponential models such as first in first out \n(FIFO) or hest effort can no longer be used for efficient \nperformance on these service classes. Comparison of FIFO \nwith other two mechanisms namely static priority scheduling \n(SPS) and earliest deadline first (EDF) for GPRS service \nclasses illustrates that EDF is more suitable for bursty services \n[4]. One of the drawbacks in EDF is higher complexity of this \ntechnique leads to implementation difficulties in practical \nsituations. The EDF mechanism needs to sort the packet queue \nusing at least O(logN) insertion operation for each arrived \npacket. This affects its application due to implementation \ndifficulty. Also at the same time with a mix of bursty and non \nbursty services EDF allows resource exploitation of buttsy or \nhigh QoS services. Therefore the objective of this work is to \ndesign a CAC and scheduling algorithm to allocate resources in \na fair and efficient manner among diverse sei of services \nsatisfying the QoS agreements. \nSection II looks in to the GPRS dara communication \narchitecture followed by QoS management of GPRS in Section \n111. Section IV presents the problem of efficient allocation of \nresources among diverse set of service classes as an \noptimization challenge. Encoding this problem into a genetic \nalgorithm environment i s  discussed in Section V. Section VI \ndiscuss the performance evaluation of the proposed technique \nover a GPRS system is compared with state of the art \nalgorithms.

GPRS DATA COMMLNICATION ARCHITECKRE \nThe General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) designated to \nsupport packet oriented data transmission is an extension of the \nGlobal System for Mobile Communications (GSM). Regarding \nthe offered service, GPRS allows the subscriber to send and \nreceive data in an end-to-end packet transfer mode, without \nusing any network resources in circuit switched mode. This \nallows for autonomous operation of GPRS and best fits the \nbursty traffic characteristics. Radio communication between \nthe mobile station (MS) and the GPRS network covers physical \nand data link layer functionality. The physical layer provides \nservices for information transfer over a physical channel \nbetween the MS and the network. These functions include data \nunit framing, data coding, and the detection and correction of \nphysical medium transmission errors [9]. \nThe data link layer has been separated into two distinct \nsublayers. The radio link controllmedium access control \n(RLCIMAC) mediates access to the shared medium between \nThe work reponed in this paper has been pan offhe Networks & Services Work Area of the Core II Research Programme of the Vinuvl Centre o f  Excellence in \nMobile & Personal Communications.

The packets, which are \nreccived from the network layer, are transmitted across the air \ninterface using the logical link control (LLC) protocol. The \nLLC layer operates above the MAC layer. An LLC frame in \nthe RLCiMAC layer is segmented into radio blocks, which are \nformatted into bursts on the physical layer. The size of the \nblock depends on the applied coding scheme. Each radio block \ncomprises 4 normal bursts in consecutive TDMA frames as \nshown in Fig. 1 \n~~ ~~ ~~ \nFigure 1. GPRS Radio Block Architecture \nAs a hybrid frequency divisiodtime division system, GSM \norganizes radio transmissions by assigning carriers and time \nslots to logical channels. Thc frame duration is 4.615 ms, and \neach frame is divided into eight time slots. A cell that supports \nGPRS shall allocate one or more shared packet data channels, \nwhich are taken from the common pool of physical channels \navailable to the cell and otherwise used for speech. A physical \nchannel dedicated to packet data traffic is called a packet data \nchannel. The need for efficient use of radio spectrum requires \ndynamic change of the mix of speech and data channels. It  is \nalso possible to interrupt a data transmission to one MS if a \nhigh priority service is to be sent to some other MS. \n111. Q O S  MANAGEMENT M GPRS SYSTEM \nQoS in GPRS is defined as the collective effect of service \nperformances, which determines the degree of satisfaction of a \nuser of the service. QoS enables the differentiation between \nprovided services. The QoS attributes used in [7] and [8] are \nvery similar apart from the difference related only to the \nthroughput QoS attributes. In [7] five QoS attributes are \ndefined. These are the precedence, delay class, reliability class, \nmean throughput and peak throughput class. There are four \ndelay classes in the GPRS QoS profile: delay classes 1, 2 and 3 \noffer predictive services and require QoS management, while \nclass 4 provides a best effort service. Two types of delay \nprofiles are specified as QoS parameters. One of them is the \nmean delay and the other one is the maximum delay in 95% of \nall transfers. In four delay classes listed two types of SDU sizes \nare specified (i.e., 128 and 1024 octets) [Table 11. By \ncombining these attributes many possible QoS profiles are \ndefined. To determine delay requirements for different packet \nlcngths [4] came up with the set of equations derived with \ninterpolation techniques. \n[Table I] GPRS \"os Pmlilc \nIV. PROBLEM DEFINITION \nThe problem of resource allocation in agreement with QoS \nprofiles of services can he seen as efficient distribution of n \nservice classes among g number of resources. Each service is \ngraded according to their QoS parameters. It is needed to find \nan optimum way of allocating n number of services among a \nresource pool of g resources. Since an optimum allocation \npresents a combination of services among resources this kind \nof problems are called combinatorial optimizafion problem. In \nthis work the QoS profiles of service classes are reflected in \ntheir QoS in&. \nThe scheduling mechanism determines the serving of each \nservice class queue in order to stay within the agreed QoS \nrange. When meeting this QoS range, which QoS categories \nneeded to be accepted, which are to he rejected are determined \nby the call admission control (CAC). CAC decides whether to \naccept, reject or delay a call. \nTherefore the CAC and scheduling algorithm must look at a \nwider view on dynamic as well as static factors and at the same \ntime capturing the traffic profile of service classes. The \ndynamic factors such as queue length, and static factors QoS \nprofile, faimess among services needs to be considered in \ndesigning the scheduling algorithms for future services. Data \ntraffic such as WWW browsing, which are bursty in nature \nexhibits self similarity behaviour at the aggregate level [I]. \nHence to avoid undesirable features arising due to bursty \ncharacteristics, it is needed to watch the traffic profile, which is \ndynamic in nature. This needs to become a real time solution \nsupporting dynamic nature of traffic. \nSince this problem needs a dynamic real time solution \nreasonably fast efficient algorithms are required. Given a hard \noptimisation problem it is often possible to find an optimum \nsolution facing minimum space and time complexity. For small \nsearch spaces, classical exhaustive search algorithms can be \napplied, hut for larger search spaces special AI techniques must \nbe applied. Genetic Algorithms (GAS) are among such \n0-7803-8255-2\/04\/$20.00 IEEE. 2529 \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on May 17,2010 at 15:35:54 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. \ntechniques. They are stochastic algorithms whose search \nmethods model natural phenomena. This natural evolution is \nbased on operations like selection criteria, cross over, mutation \netc [6] .  \nA .  Mapping theproblem to GA environment \nAllocation of g resources among n service classes in a fair \nand efficient manner can be represented as a chromosome in a \nGA environment. Fig. 2 shows the chromosome representation \nor the packing order of 8 service classes (SI ... Sg) among 6 \nresources (RI _._ &). In the GA environment the number of \nresources in the system determines the length of a \nchromosome. In Fig.2 Chromosomel and Chromosome2 \nrepresent two different ways of service class allocation among \n6 resources. The chromosome length is 6 or the number of free \nresources waiting in the resource pool for service allocation. In \nChromosomel multiple resources are given to S5 and in \nChromosomel that is given to S, .  If there are n services \nrequesting a resource, then there are more than one ways of \nallocating these services among the resource pool. Each \nfeasible solution represents a unique chromosome in the search \nspace. Optimum service allocation is determined using the \nfitness criteria and using standard GA operations. \nFitness function in GA reflects the criteria for the optimum \nresource allocation. When considering optimum allocation \nlimiting factors such as QoS profile, fairness among service \nclasses need to he reflected. The fitness function decides the \nsurvivability of the best chromosomes thus deriving optimum \nsolution in the GA environment. \nApart from the above factors dynamic traffic profile is \nconsidered to understand the real time problem caused by \ntraffic characteristics. Thus introduces the \u201cRefreshing Frame\u201d \nin the solution phase. Each solution is valid for only one \nrefresh frame duration. After each refreshing frame resources \nmust be reallocated according to the new optimum solution. \nRefreshing frames act as a dynamic way of looking and \nestimating real time traffic characteristics when allocating \nresources among multi service classes. \nI I I I I I I \nFigure 2. Chromosome Representalion \nV. FImwS CRERIA \nservice class. Following section describes the influence of each \nfactor on the fitness function. \nThe QoSind, of the service class depends on QoS \nparameters such as delay and priority. This index reflects the \ninteraction between the QoS parameters of each service class. \nQoS parameters are graded according to their influence. For \nexample in this work priority class has more weight than that of \ndelay classes. \nQoSindeY ranges from 1 to 100, from the highest QoS service \nwith QoSinder 100 to the lowest at QoS index 1. There is a non- \nlinear relationship among QoS indexes of different service \nclasses. \nQoS parameter influence is inversely proportional to the \nQoSinder. The weighting of QoS parameters to QoS index \ndecreases according to the square root law. For example \nconsider a QoS profile of the service class is defined with QoS \nparameters p ;  and p2 .  When determining the QoS index of this \nservice class the weight of highest QoS parameter @;) is \ninversely proportional to the QoS index with weight 1. The \nnext QoS parameter @.,) is inversely proportional to the QoS \nindex with a weight of dp2. Therefore the QoS index of a \nservice with QoS profile defined in p ,  and p., can be \nrepresented as: \nWhere p ;  parameter has more influence than p.\u2019 on QoS \nprofile of this service. \nThe next factor considered in the fitness calculation is \ndynamic queue length (93 of each service class queues. This \nfactor reflects the call arrival rate, call duration distributions \nand average service rates of each queue. In fitness calculation \nthe dynamic queue length of each queue is measured at the \nbeginning of each refreshing frame. \nNext, fairness factor is considered in the scheduling \nmechanism. The main reason of introducing fairness to the \nfitness criteria is to avoid exploitation of resources by one \nservice class. This is a major weakness of the available \nscheduling schemes such as  EDF (earliest deadlineidelay first). \nThe fitness decreases when the same service class request for \nmore than one resources thus avoiding the exploitation. This is \nmaintained in the fitness iimction evaluation with the \nintroduction of \u2018resource frequency\u2019 v;). \nTherefore by considering the above three factors in fitness \nevaluation the fitness of a service class (F,) can he presented as; \n(2) \n\u2019 Q; *qi F. = K -  8 \nWhere K\u2019 is a proportionality constant \nFrom (2) fitness of the chromosome shucture (CJ in Fig. 2 \nOptimum solution selection is based on the fitness \ncalculation of each chromosome.

TRAFFIC SOURCES \nTraffic consist of GPRS applications, which includes email, \nrailway traffic, mobitex and web browsing representing \ndifferent probability distributions in burst sizes opposed to \ntraditional Exponential models [9]. WWW data contributes 20 \n% of the total traftic mix and that for Email sessions is 40 % \nwhere as Railway and Mobitex traftic each presenting 20 % o f  \nthe traffic mix. In this work focus is mainly on the down link \nperformance. \nTotal Email sessions are presented by the FUNET model, \nwhich is based on statistics collected on Email usage from the \nFinnish University and Research Network [9]. The probability \ndistribution function of Email connection sizes can be \napproximated by a truncated Cauchy (a = 0.8 and p = 1 )  \ndistribution with a maximum message size of 10 Kbytes. The \nprobability density function of the Cauchy distribution is as of \n(4)- \n(4) \nWWW session is a characteristic application of hierarchical \ncall architecture. Browsing session consists of sequence of \npacket calls and during a packet call several packets may be \ngenerated constituting a hursty sequence of packets. It is very \nimportant to take this phenomenon in to account in the traffic \nmodel. This hurstyness during the packet call is a characteristic \nfeature of packet transmission in the network. \nIn a WWW browsing session a packet call corresponds to \nthe downloading of a WWW document. After the document is \nentirely arrived to the terminal, the user is consuming certain \namount of time for studying the information. This time interval \nis called the reading lime. Hence a typical behaviour of a \nWWW browsing model is based on distributions described by \nsession arrival process, number of packet calls per session, \nreading time between packet calls, number of bursts within a \npacket call, inter arrival time between bursts and the size of the \nburst. The modeling of WWW service application follows a \nPareto burst size distribution (a - 1.1 and = 81.5), with \nmaximum burst size of 66666 bytes [5]. The probability \ndensity function of the Pareto distribution is as of (8). \nThe average burst size of WWW browsing is 480 bytes. \nApart from the above applications uniformly and \nexponentially distributed packet sizes of the Mobitex and Rail \ndata contribute towards the traffic mix [9]. \nVII. PERFORMANCE COMPARISON \nComparisons are made with available techniques such as \nEDF and FIFO. Eight different service classes are considered \nwith different QoS profiles. GPRS occupying a single carrier is \nconsidered. Each TDMA frame consists of eight time slots. Out \nof these eight slots one slot is allocated for signaling resulting \nfor seven GPRS. QoS profile is based on the delay classes and \nprecedence QoS parameters [Table I]. The refreshing frame is \nselected as 200 frames where a GPRS frame is 18.46ms. \nTherefore in every - 4s time duration the optimum resource \nallocation is updated. Apart from the hursty data services a \ntraffic mix comprising voice and data are also considered for \ncomparison p q o s e s .  In this study voice calls are allocated to \nthe resources as in GSM. \n[Table 21 presents the service class classification of the \ntraffic mix. Services are classified according to two QoS \nparameters namely delay and priority of a service. These \nparameters are taken in to consideration when calculating QoS \nindex for the CA scheduling algorithm. Therefore [Table 21 \ncategorize the 8 service classes. \nFurthermore as a quantifiable performance measurement \namong different mechanisms, 141 introduced the comparison of \nperformance between average nornialized delays. Average \nnormalized delay is defined as the ratio between experienced \nineon delay and the imposed delay for the service class with the \nagreement of the QoS profile.

Also data channels will be pre-empted if there are no free \nchannels available to cany the voice call. The dropping policy \nfor data packets is two fold.

CONCLUSIONS \nFrom the simulation results it can be deduced the proposed \nGA based CAC and scheduling mechanism gives a reasonable \nefficiency for the data services irrespective of the service \nclasses. Also at the same time this does not sacrifice the \nperformances of the lower QoS profile services. The increase \nof performance compared to other available mechanisms is \nmainly due to the fitness calculation technique and the \ninclusion of refreshing frame concept considering dynamic \nnature of the traffic profile. \nThis novel admission control and scheduling criteria is \nbased on 3 different parameters, embedded in the fitness \nfunction, addressing the multi dimensional nature of the \nproblem. They are QoS index of the service class, dynamic \nqueue length of each service class, and frequency of resources \nallocated for each service class. QoS index, which is a function \nof more than one QoS parameters, captures QoS profile of \nservice classes more accurately and realistically. The fitness \nfunction, which calculates the suitability for getting the \nresource, is designed to allocate resources among services in a \nfair manner. Moreover dynamic resource allocation among the \nservices is achieved more practically and realistically with the \nintroduction of refreshing frame concept. This novel concept \ncaptures the chaotic behaviour of traffic dynamically. The \nresults demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves \nefficient resource allocation among diverse service classes for \nGPRS system. The proposed GA based call admission control \nand scheduling algorithm gives a better control on resource \nallocation compared to the existing methods. \nI11 \nI21 \n131 \n[41 \nL61 \n[71 \n191 \n2533 \nREFERENCES \nW.
