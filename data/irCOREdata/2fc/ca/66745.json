Posi-\ntive compound lean (where the blade suction surface\n(SS) makes an obtuse angle with the end-wall) has a\nsubstantial body of literature describing it but there\nis much less information on the operation of RCL\n(where the blade SS makes an acute angle with the\nend-wall). Compound lean (as defined in Harrison\n[1]) is where the SS makes an obtuse angle with the\nend-wall and its shape, when viewed axially, is\nconvex on the pressure surface. Reverse compound\nlean is the reverse of this and gives a concave\npressure surface.\nThe RCL shown in this paper is achieved by fixing\nthe end-wall section locations and varying the stack-\ning line in between them. The geometry was\ndesigned using fully three-dimensional viscous CFD\ncalculations to achieve a reduction in secondary\nflow. The experimental results comprise pneumatic\nprobe measurements, surface flow visualization,\nand surface static pressures. A feature of the present\nwork is that great care has been taken to achieve\nrepeatable results in a similar manner to Ingram\nand Gregory-Smith [2]; the loss changes involved\nare small and careful measurement is required.\nEach measurement on the leaned geometry is\naccompanied by a measurement on the prismatic\nblades, thus all the measurements in this paper are\nnew and are not simply referenced from previous\nstudies on the \u2018Durham cascade\u2019.\nThe aim of this work is to achieve an understand-\ning of three-dimensional blade design, in general,\nand RCL, in particular, by providing a substantial\nbody of high-quality experimental data and compar-\ning it to other authors\u2019 studies.\n2 BACKGROUND\nA number of researchers have investigated the effect\nof lean on the flow field in axial flow turbines, for\n\u0001Corresponding author: School of Engineering, University of\nDurham, South Road, Durham DH1 1LE, UK.\nSPECIAL ISSUE PAPER 443\nA00405 # IMechE 2005 Proc. IMechE Vol. 219 Part A: J. Power and Energy\nexample, those of Sharma et al. [3] and Harrison [1].\nA review of the three-dimensional design of aerofoils,\nwhich includes blade lean was undertaken by\nDenton and Xu [4].\nSharma et al. [3] obtained a number of results from\nboth a linear cascade and CFD, including work on\nRCL. The authors demonstrated that blade lean in\neither direction redistributed loss. RCL reduced loss\nat mid-span but increased it at the end-wall, whereas\ncompound lean demonstrated an increased loss at\nthe mid-span region and a reduction towards the\nend-walls.\nThe work of Harrison [1] is based on experimental\nresults of a linear cascade. Harrison investigated\nthree blade stacking arrangements, a prismatic refer-\nence case, a straight leaned case, and a compound\nleaned one. The surface static pressures for the\ncompound leaned blade showed a behaviour similar\nto the work of Sharma et al. [3].\nThe work of Denton and Xu [4] includes, among\nother three-dimensional effects, tangential lean. The\npaper derives a qualitative relationship between the\nlean-induced blade forces, the radial pressure gradi-\nent, and the streamline curvature acceleration. It is\nnoted that for low aspect ratio blades (like the\nDurhamcascade), the radial pressure termdominates\nand hence \u2018the radial blade force will be opposed\nmainly by the increased radial pressure gradient\u2019.\nIn general, all researchers obtain similar flow\nbehaviours, but the benefits of the leaning, that is,\nloss reduction and exit yaw angle distribution seem\nto vary depending on the inlet flow and geometry.\n3 BLADE DESIGN\nA series of CFD tests were conducted to investigate\nthe effects of different degrees of compound lean.\nThe final choice was made on the basis of a predicted\nsignificant effect of lean and reduction in secondary\nflow. In addition, the design had to be reasonably\nrealistic for engine application with a modest\ndegree of compound lean. The geometry chosen for\ninvestigation was an elliptical tangential stacking\nprofile with 158 inclination at the end-wall. A sche-\nmatic of the prismatic and leant blade is shown in\nFig. 1(a) and the geometry is shown in Fig. 1(b),\nthis geometry was called the C1 blade. To ensure\ndirect comparison between the prismatic and RCL\nblades, the geometry was chosen to have the same\noverall turning and blade profile.\n4 EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUE\nThe so-called \u2018Durham cascade\u2019 is a linear cascade of\nsix blades each of 400 mm span. It is a well-known\nCFD test case [5]. Upstream of the test section is a\nturbulence grid which generates a 4 per cent inlet\nturbulence intensity. There is also a boundary layer\nbleed on one side of the tunnel, which introduces\nan asymmetry into the inlet conditions with a corre-\nsponding asymmetry in the exit flow. The inlet flow\nconditions are shown in Fig. 2, which shows the\nasymmetry in the inlet flow. The measurements are\ntaken from slots cut into the cascade on the \u2018upper\u2019\n(r \u00bc 400 mm) wall which means that the readings\ntaken near this wall will be much less accurate, due\nto leakage through the slots and the effect of the\nprobe stem.\nThe original prismatic blades (described in this\npaper as the C0 blade) were measured in a \u2018back-\nto-back\u2019 method with the C1 blades to provide an\naccurate comparison of loss changes, as described\nby Ingram and Gregory-Smith [2].\nPneumatic probemeasurements used conventional\nthree- and five-hole probes. Manufacture of the C1\nblade using sterolithography allowed pressure tap-\npings to be placed along the span of the blade. For\neach probe type (five-hole and three-hole) and\neach geometry (C0 and C1), three sets of readings\nwere taken, but with a reset of the measurement\nsystem between each measurement run. As the pris-\nmatic blade profile is already quite efficient, the loss\nchanges were very small and this technique gives\nconfidence that the changes in loss are greater than\nthe errors in the measurement system.\nFig. 1 Schematic (a) and geometry (b) of RCL\nFig. 2 Inlet boundary layer\n444 D A Bagshaw, G L Ingram, D G Gregory-Smith, and M R Stokes\nProc. IMechE Vol. 219 Part A: J. Power and Energy A00405 # IMechE 2005\nFlow visualization was conducted using a two\ncolour oil\u2013dye mixture applied to the surface of the\nblade. For a detailed description of both the cascade\nand the experimental technique, see reference [6].\nThe major difference in experimental technique\nbetween this work and earlier tests in the Durham\ncascade is that the full 400 mm span is measured\nrather than just half span.\n5 AREA TRAVERSES\nA measurement plane 28 per cent of the blade axial\nchord (Cax) downstream of the trailing edges was\nused. All the area traverses were conducted over\nthe full span of the cascade but some results are\npresented for only the \u2018lower\u2019 half of the cascade\n(0\u2013200 mm). This is because the effects are similar\nat both ends of the cascade and the measurements\nat the \u2018lower\u2019 half of the cascade are more accurate\nfor reasons discussed earlier.\nExperimental loss contours for the C0 and C1\nblades are given in Fig. 3. The mean of the three\ndata sets for the five- and three-hole probes are com-\nbined to give a complete passage loss distribution.\nEach contour plot, therefore, represents the results\nof some six separate traverses. The combined dataset\nwas only for the loss as the three-hole probe data\ncannot give pitch angles and therefore neither sec-\nondary velocities nor secondary kinetic energy. The\nfollowing points can be determined from an inspec-\ntion of Fig. 3.\n1. The reverse compound leaned blades, C1, produce\na noticeably bowed wake.\n2. The mid-span of the C1 wake has a slightly lower\npeak loss than that of the prismatic blades, Cp0 of\n0.5 compared with 0.6.\n3. The corner vortex loss core (seen at2320 mm tan-\ngential, 5 mm radial for C0) is shifted tangentially\n(relative to the wake) in C1. This is due to\nincreased overturning at the wall.\n4. The trailing vorticity\/SS horseshoe-vortex (SS\nHSV) loss core is much weaker in the C1 blades.\nWhere as previously (in C0) this loss was clearly\ndefined and separate; here, the region appears to\nhave merged with the passage vortex core (located\nat 2250 mm tangential, 60 mm radial).\n5. The passage vortex loss core has itself increased in\nstrength for the C1 blades and this is partly due to\ncombining the loss from the SS HSV core and\npartly to increased loss generation in the secon-\ndary flows.\n6. There is a slight movement of the secondary losses\ntoward the end-wall. The passage vortex loss fea-\nture is in a similar position in both C0 and C1.\nOnly the decrease in strength of the trailing vorti-\ncity\/SS HSV loss core has brought about any\napparent shift in loss.\nThe secondary velocity vectors for the C0 and C1\nblades are given in Fig. 4. The definition of secondary\nvectors used in this paper is given in Appendix 2. The\nsecondary vectors were obtained from the mean of\nthe five-hole probe traverses; therefore each vector\nplot represents three separate measurement tra-\nverses. Figure 4 shows the following.\n1. The SS HSV vectors are weaker in C1 than C0 and\nthis leads to a weaker interaction with the passage\nvortex.\n2. The passage vortex is similar in size and strength\nfor C0 and C1, but has shifted slightly radially\ntoward the end-wall.\n3. The near-wall region for the C1 blade has strong\nsecondary velocities, associated with increased\noverturning. The corner vortex is more difficult\nto discern in C1 due to this strong overturning.\nFig. 3 Loss contours at 28 per cent Cax downstream\nExperimental study of RCL 445\nA00405 # IMechE 2005 Proc. IMechE Vol. 219 Part A: J. Power and Energy\n6 PITCH-AVERAGED RESULTS\nThe repeatability of the traverse data is shown in\nFig. 5, where the pitch-averaged loss coefficient for\neach of the three traverses for C0 and C1 are plotted.\nThe differences between different runs on the same\ngeometry are much smaller than the differences\nbetween geometries, giving confidence that the\nresults presented in this paper are reliable. Figure 6\nshows a similar plot for pitch-averaged yaw angle;\nagain the repeatability is very good except for one\ntraverse for C1 which shows an offset between it\nand the other two C1 runs. This offset was put\ndown to an error in setting the yaw angle on the\nfive-hole probe before traversing.\nThe pitch-averaged results give a quantitative view\nof Figs 3 and 4. The pitch-averaged graphs show that\nthe asymmetry in the inlet boundary layer convects\nthrough the passage for both the prismatic and\nleaned geometries. The slot in the end-wall through\nwhich the cobra-headed probe is traversed also\nintroduces asymmetry into the measured flow field.\nThe loss cores in Fig. 5 are of different size and\nthere was more underturning (Fig. 6) on the lower\nside (0\u2013200 mm) for both C0 and C1.\nHaving established the repeatability of the traver-\nsing from Figs 5 and 6, the following key points\nabout the differences between C0 and C1 can be\nestablished.\n1. There is a slight radial shift towards the end-wall\nof the loss core associated with the passage vortex.\n2. The peak loss of the passage vortex core also\nincreased in the experimental result for C1.\n3. There is a reduction in mid-span loss for C1 com-\npared with C0.\n4. The near-wall loss is higher for C1 than that for C0.\nThis is not clear when looking at the area plots but\nis highlighted in the pitch-averaged data.\n5. There is reduced turning at mid-span for the C1\ngeometry. Therefore, the C1 blade is unloaded at\nmid-span compared with the prismatic case.\n6. The new blades increase the overturning at the\nwall while maintaining a similar level of under-\nturning. Therefore, the C1 blade is more highly\nloaded at the ends.\nFig. 4 Secondary vectors at 28 per cent Cax downstream\nFig. 5 Repeated pitch-averaged loss measurements at\n28 per cent Cax downstream\nFig. 6 Pitch-averaged yaw angle at 28 per cent Cax\ndownstream\n446 D A Bagshaw, G L Ingram, D G Gregory-Smith, and M R Stokes\nProc. IMechE Vol. 219 Part A: J. Power and Energy A00405 # IMechE 2005\n7 AREA MASS-AVERAGED RESULTS\nTable 1 shows area-averaged loss coefficients for the\nlower half of the span (0\u2013200 mm) and so excludes\nthe inaccuracies near the upper wall. They are net\nvalues having the inlet loss subtracted and so rep-\nresent the loss growth through the cascade. Mid-\nspan loss is defined as the area-averaged loss\nbetween 180 and 200 mm in the radial direction.\nSecondary loss is simply the total loss minus the\nmid-span loss.\nTable 1 shows an overall reduction of loss for the\nC1 geometry with an increase in secondary loss and\na reduction in mid-span loss.\nThe results for the three- and five-hole probes are\nshown as a combined loss value. The three-hole\nprobe was traversed 0\u201315 mm radially, the five-\nhole probe was traversed 5\u2013395 mm radially. This\nprovides an overlap of the data and for the combined\ndataset, the two traverses were joined at 10 mm\nspanwise position. This position was chosen to\nensure the maximum use of the five-hole probe\nwhile eliminating errors due to the close proximity\nof the five-hole probe with the wall.\nThe overall differences in averaged yaw angle are\nsmall; in the 5\u2013200 mm region, the C0 area averaged\nyaw angle is 268.758 and the C1 area-averaged yaw\nangle is 268.458. By looking at Fig. 6, it should be\nnoted that the average angle is in effect a mass-\naveraged tangent. The difference of \u00010.38 is extre-\nmely small, although larger than the accuracy of\nthe experimental measurement system [6]. The aver-\naged yaw angle suggests that the overall turning has\nnot changed and thus the reduction in loss cannot be\nattributed to a change in overall loading.\n8 BLADE SURFACE STATIC PRESSURE\nFigures 7 and 8 show the static pressure distribution\nfor the two blades. Note that the blade tapping radial\npositions are not identical but a comparison of the\ngraphs allows the trends to be clearly determined.\nThe static pressure distribution for the C0 blade\n(Fig. 7) shows the \u2018flat topped\u2019 profile of the\nDurham cascade profile with the suction side\npressure levelling off after \u000135 per cent Cax. This\nmay contrast with more recent aerofoil designs\nwhich tend to \u2018aft load\u2019 the blade. The prismatic\nblade shows a gradual SS diffusion as the end-wall\nis approached. The effect of the passage vortex can\nbe seen in the increase in Cp value between 70\u2013100\nper cent Cax for the r \u00bc 5 and 15 mm tappings.\nThe C1 blade (Fig. 8), in contrast, shows a reduced\nloading at mid-span that increases as the end-wall is\napproached. The influence on the static pressure\ncoefficient of the passage vortex at low radial heights\nis again apparent.\n9 FLOW VISUALIZATION\nA conventional oil and dye visualization technique\nwas used; a yellow dye was applied to the blades\nand a red dye on the end-wall. The blade is coloured\nblack and the end-wall is white; therefore, an absence\nof dye on the end-wall is a light colour, whereas on the\nblade, an absence of dye is a dark colour.\nFigure 9 shows the suction side leg of the HSV and\nthe passage vortex separation line climbing up the SS\nfor both C0 and C1. At the trailing edge, the passage\nvortex for C1 appears to be much closer to the\nFig. 7 Blade static pressures: C0 blade\nFig. 8 Blade static pressures: C1 blade\nTable 1 Area-averaged net loss 28 per cent Cax\ndownstream\nArea averaged loss (Cp0) Prismatic (%)\nC0 C1 C0 C1\nTotal 0.1911 0.1707 100.0 89.3\nMid-span 0.0921 0.0533 100.0 57.9\nSecondary 0.0990 0.1174 100.0 118.6\nExperimental study of RCL 447\nA00405 # IMechE 2005 Proc.

However, such a great\ndifference is not seen in the traverses 28 per cent\nCax downstream of trailing edge, where the passage\nvortex cores are more similarly located.\nFigure 10 provides details of the end-wall flow for\nC0 and C1. In Fig. 10(a), the SS leg and PS leg of the\nHSV are indicated for the prismatic blade. Compari-\nson with Fig. 10(b) shows the shift of the SS HSV\nblade attachment point around the SS towards the\ntrailing edge onC1. The end-wall trace of the pressure\nside leg of the HSV (seen close to the bottom of the\nimage in Fig. 10(a) for C0 is not visible on C1.\n10 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\nThe effect of the RCL is shown to agree with that\nexpected from the literature. At the end-wall, the\nradial component of blade force reduces the pressure\ncausing a shift in flow towards the end-wall within\nthe blade passage. As the flow leaves the trailing\nedge, the radial force is removed and so the flow\nredistributes towards mid-span. Thus in Fig. 9, the\nflow visualization shows the secondary flow for C1\nconfined closer to the end-wall, but at the traverse\nposition 28 per cent Cax downstream, the location\nof the passage vortices and loss cores is very similar\nfor C0 and C1.\nThe RCL also increases the loading near the end-\nwall as seen in the increased overturning with C1\nand the blade static pressure distributions. There is\na corresponding unloading at mid-span as shown\nby the reduction in turning at mid-span and\nagain by the pressure distributions. However,\nthe reduction in turning is compensated by the\nincreased overturning near the end-wall, so that\nthe overall turning is not significantly changed. The\npitch-averaged loss (Fig. 5) shows an increase up to\n70 mm from the end-wall. Beyond that there is a\nsignificant reduction in loss, so that overall the loss\nis reduced by 11 per cent with the RCL.\nThe reduction in mid-span turning and loss\nobserved at the traverse position 28 per cent Cax\nFig. 9 Flow visualization: passage vortex growth\nFig. 10 Flow visualization: end-wall flow\n448 D A Bagshaw, G L Ingram, D G Gregory-Smith, and M R Stokes\nProc. IMechE Vol. 219 Part A: J. Power and Energy A00405 # IMechE 2005\ndownstream can be understood by considering the\nthree-dimensional effects caused by the RCL. The\nstream tube is thickened as the axial velocity is\nreduced from leading to trailing edge in the blade\npassage, and the acceleration is therefore reduced.\nThus, the blade surface velocities are reduced caus-\ning a reduction in frictional loss. At the trailing\nedge, the exit flow angle will be similar to the two-\ndimensional value, but as the stream tube is thinned\ndownstream (with the flow redistribution) the axial\nvelocity increases, whereas the tangential com-\nponent of velocity is unchanged. Thus, the yaw\nangle is reduced as observed at the traverse position\n28 per cent Cax downstream.\nFrom the work presented in this paper, a number\nof specific conclusions can be drawn.\n1. RCL reduces loss at the mid-span and increases it\ntowards the end-wall.\n2. The blade profile and loading given results in an\noverall decrease in loss of 11 per cent.\n3. The mass-averaged turning angle remains the\nsame for both cases, confirming that the RCL\ndesign has reduced loss while maintaining the\nsame overall blade loading.\n4. The exit yaw angle has become more nonuniform\nand this may result in increased downstream\nmixing loss.\n5. The results are consistent with those found by\nother researchers.\n6. An understanding of the effects of RCL requires\nan appreciation of the three-dimensional effects\nproduced by the RCL.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThis work has been carried out with the support of\nRolls-Royce plc, MoD, and DTI CARAD.
