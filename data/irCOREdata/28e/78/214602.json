We called him Marx to remind us that we had never read Marx and now we have read a \nlittle and taken so strong a personal dislike to the man that we can\u2019t look the dog in the face when we speak to him. \n(letter from Eileen Blair to a friend, January 1st 1938, in Davison 2006: 72) \n \nAt least in the Anglo-American critical tradition, non-communist Leftists have long had an ambivalent \nrelationship with Marx. For the above letter writer and her husband, George Orwell, the aversion to Marx was \npersonal, borne out of recent experience of Marxist sectarianism during the Spanish Civil War and bitter \nexchanges with intellectual apologists for Stalin\u2019s Russia. Orwell\u2019s subsequent novels \u2013 Animal Farm and \n1984 \u2013 would of course do much to undermine the moral credibility of Marxism, yet as a democratic socialist \nhe conceded that a Marxist perspective was necessary to understanding social change and conflict. Sixty \nyears after this letter, the philosopher Richard Rorty cited Orwell approvingly in a book upbraiding the \nAmerican New Left for indulging in sterile \u2018Foucauldian-Marxist\u2019 theorising rather than engaging politically \nwith the damaging consequences of globalisation (Rorty 1998). At the same time, he acknowledged the \npolitical courage of that Left in opposing the Vietnam War and other US military ventures. \n \nAmerican academics Yda Schreuder and George Gonzalez both adopt neo- Marxist perspectives to examine \narguably the most serious environmental impact of economic globalisation \u2013 human-induced climate change. \nAnd it is from these original, penetrating studies that we can gauge something of the explanatory value of \ncritical political economy for understanding climate politics in the twenty-first century. Both are highly \ninsightful volumes, carefully substantiating their arguments from multiple sources, while their clear, \nconsidered prose is a refreshing contrast to the obscurantism common in Marxist-inspired cultural theory. \n \nThe conceptual starting-point for Schreuder\u2019s study is globalisation theory, notably that critical variant (she \ncites Noam Chomsky and Naomi Klein as representative authors) which contends that power in the global \neconomy has shifted from national governments to transnational corporations and investors. Through foreign \ndirect investment (FDI) and international trade, economic globalisation is claimed by Schreuder to be the \nmain driver of the worldwide increase in fossil fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. The first half of her book \ninterprets the international treaty negotiations on climate change \u2013 the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change and Kyoto Protocol \u2013 in the political and economic context of the social and \nenvironmental impacts of globalisation. As with other critics of market-led globalisation, Schreuder suggests \nthat neoliberalism and the \u2018Washington Consensus\u2019 provided pivotal ideological support for its spread to \ndeveloping countries. Chapter 3 shows convincingly how the expansion of foreign trade and (especially) FDI \nhas locked developing countries into a fossil-fuel-based infrastructure: these countries effectively have no \nscope to avoid carbon-intensive development paths, even though this weakens further the international \nprospects for reducing greenhouse gas emissions to safe levels. \n \nThe core climate contradiction Schreuder attributes to economic globalisation is that its relentless market \nexpansion, driven by intense competition around transnational corporations and international production \nnetworks, renders national emission reductions (such as those under the Kyoto Protocol) ineffective in \nhalting or reversing global warming (p. 31). It is at this point, I think, that her image of the \u2018corporate \ngreenhouse\u2019 is particularly useful in highlighting the responsibility deficit of international governance \nresponses to climate change. The second half of her book interrogates how the leading examples of two \nKyoto Protocol implementation strategies \u2013 the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and the Clean Development \nMechanism \u2013 are hampered by the mismatch between national regulatory responsibilities under Kyoto and \nthe ability of transnational corporations to escape effective emissions control. Thus, in Chapter 5 Schreuder \ndetails the myriad \u2018carbon leakages\u2019 arising from the geographical displacement of emissions as a result of \nCO2 emissions reductions in Kyoto Protocol Annex I countries, while in Chapter 6 she shows how major oil \nand energy companies can manipulate the Clean Development Mechanism to earn emissions reduction \ncredits whilst simultaneously undertaking energy-intensive development in developing countries and \neconomies in transition. \n \nWhile sharing Schreuder\u2019s critical intent, George Gonzalez is sceptical of the explanatory reach of \nglobalisation theory. His conceptual frame of reference is the \u2018empire of capital\u2019 argument formulated by \nEllen Meiksins Wood (2003). Wood subscribes to Marx\u2019s foundational theory of surplus value, and the \nrelated claim that states uphold and enforce property relations that facilitate the alienation of workers from \nthe means of production. Moreover, she maintains that this role for states in reproducing capitalism still holds \nin the era of global economic integration, although the most powerful states ensure that capital flows above \nall to the core centres of corporate wealth and private consumption. In his book, Gonzalez extends this \nanalysis in a revealing direction by arguing that the long-standing commitment of the US state to urban \nsprawl \u2013 that is, highly diffuse urban development \u2013 is a requisite feature of modern global capitalism. \nFacilitated by historical access to abundant sources of oil, and the political capture of state agencies by local \ngrowth coalitions, urban sprawl fostered an energy intensive mode of development \u2013 one still promoted by \nthe US government by means of land use policies, road building projects, mortgage protection schemes and \npolicies to minimise oil prices. The global ecological upshot of this strategy, Gonzalez claims, is the \nacceleration of climate change and a substantial alliance of US political and economic interests against any \ninternational climate regulation with demanding reduction targets for greenhouse gas emissions. \n \nAt the heart of Gonzalez\u2019s book is a revealing historical analysis (chapters 3\u20135) in which he lays out the \ntechniques by which urban sprawl was promoted across the country, and the implications of this for US oil \npolicy. The initial champions of urban sprawl were landed and urban business elites who, seeking to inflate \nland values on the peripheries of US cities, successfully lobbied to institute low-density development in \nplanning and housing policies. For Gonzalez, various factors in the interwar period entrenched this shift \u2013 the \naccumulation of surplus capital, the specialisation of US industrial production on the automobile and other \ndurable consumer goods, and federal housing policy in the 1930s (for example, state guarantees for home \nloans). With urban sprawl serving as the geographical underpinning for post-war American prosperity, it was \nnot surprising, Gonzalez argues, that the US state attached a high strategic priority to securing enduring \naccess to petroleum worldwide (particularly after the peaking of US oil production in 1970). The same \neconomic elites that promoted automobile-centred urban development now lobbied successfully to ensure \nthat the US government recognised this oil vulnerability \u2013 weaving the diplomatic and military thread that \nruns from US support for the Shah of Iran in the 1970s to the 2003 invasion and occupation of Iraq. \n \nBoth books demonstrate a major explanatory gain from applying a critical political economy approach to the \nsocial scientific understanding of climate change \u2013 a plausible account of the role of power relations in \ndriving carbon-intensive (and socially dislocative) economic development paths. For Schreuder and \nGonzalez, the structural lock-in worldwide to a fossil-fuel intensive infrastructure and mode of production is \nnot the outcome of a natural play of market forces or pluralistic decision-making, but the result of \nthe political dominance of capitalist interests in determining the social allocation of resources. When orthodox \neconomists designate anthropogenic climate change as a \u2018market failure\u2019, an unfortunate side-effect of \neconomic growth, they miss the systemic mechanisms by which market relations produce social and \necological harm. Each author takes a different methodological tack to show this: Schreuder surveys global \nshifts in geopolitical order and industrial production, highlighting the role of transnational corporations, while \nGonzalez excavates the material and ideological foundations of modern American capitalism. In their \ndifferent ways, they both throw new light on the pervasive carbonisation of the global economy. \n \nIt is also the virtue of both studies that, while addressed at academic and other informed audiences, they are \naccessible enough to warrant a place on undergraduate reading lists for environment, development, and \ninternational studies courses; indeed, they would serve as a provocative, suggestive counterpoint to \nmainstream climate change literature. Schreuder\u2019s book is perhaps the more student-friendly given the use \nof illustrative examples; it is more comprehensive on climate change policy and brings out well the North\u2013 \nSouth dynamics of international regulation. Were it to be well-received and revised, I would recommend \nadditional discussion of the role of state energy corporations in a future edition, as they are key actors in the \nglobal development of fossil fuels. She would also need to consider the theoretical challenges to her position \nposed by Gonzalez\u2019s arguments, notably the continuing relevance of state power and the consumption side \nof the global economy. Less dramatically, a bibliography would also be a useful addition to her book. \n \nDespite its title, the volume by Gonzalez says little about global warming as such until chapter 6, but perhaps \nthis says more about contemporary managerial framings of climate change than any shortfall in coverage, for \nthe author is focused on locating particular political and economic drivers of environmental harm. It will be a \nwelcome mark of success for this book if it stimulates more work in the historical-geographical analysis of \nclimate change: there is much to be done. It is rare that I wish an academic book were longer, but this is one \nsuch case; the approach employed by Gonzalez justifies even more of a fine-grained empirical examination, \nboth of the urban growth coalitions and their impacts on the changing landscape, and of the post-war \nprojections of US power in pursuit of energy security. There is also a cultural aspect of automobile \ndependence that deserves more attention than given here: this concerns the ubiquitous representations of \nautomobile freedom and mobility that strengthen the ideological grip of carbon-intensive economic \ndevelopment. In this respect, Matthew Paterson\u2019s (2007) Automobile politics would serve as an excellent \ncompanion to the volume by Gonzalez. \n \nThe normative stances of Schreuder and Gonzalez emerge most strongly in their discussions of political \nagency in response to climate change. As Schreuder observes, political action to tackle climate change is \noften smothered by powerful vested interests in the business community. Given her blunt assessment that \n\u2018Global capitalism as we know it today is inherently incompatible with the pursuit of ecological sustainability \nor social justice\u2019 (p. 79), her final appeal \u2018for Climate to finally find a partner in Capital\u2019 (p. 217) may seem \nincongruous. Her arguments for more accountable and equitable foreign trade and FDI are certainly \njustifiable, including the need for international regulatory tools to focus on carbon consumption rather than \nemissions. However, the politics of the energy transition from \u2018business-as usual\u2019 warrants more discussion: \nthose prepared to support the measures recommended by Schreuder will need to take on deep-rooted \ncoalitions determined to resist far-reaching carbon constraints on capital investment. Where should the \npressure for political change be forged and directed? How should capitalism be tamed or transformed? \n \nGonzalez is more candid on this, though within a US political context. The technical solutions emerging from \nthe environmental policy community (\u2018weak ecological modernisation\u2019) are, he claims, a non-starter: \u2018no \ntechnology has come forth that effectively confronts the question of climate change within the current context \nof global capitalism. In other words, . . . to allow current rates of economic growth and consumption to \ncontinue without the externality of climate change\u2019 (p. 94). Environmental groups should therefore withdraw \nfrom the \u2018undemocratic\u2019 domestic policymaking process and help in the development of a justice-based \nsocial movement challenging the imperative of urban sprawl and automobile dependence (pp. 97\u2013100). \nNevertheless, there is still the same tension as there is for Schreuder in specifying the scope of the \nnecessary political change. While Gonzalez calls for \u2018disruptive\u2019 political action from civil society, his \npreferred political outcomes would seem more than reasonable to any European social democrat \u2013 \necologically sensitive land management, the concentration of residential and work areas, and the adoption of \nmass transit as the primary means of transportation in urban areas (p. 106). Again, even if generalised \nacross the developed and developing world, would these measures be enough to steer global economic \nactors away from those routine practices threatening to cause catastrophic climate change? \n \nThere is an admirable integrity to the studies by Schreuder and Gonzalez. If there is a continuous theme in \nthe best work of Leftist intellectuals, it is in speaking the truth to power and consistently siding with the \nvictims of injustice rather those complacent groups benefiting from injustice. Should the critical thought \nexpressed in these studies strike a chord with those campaigning for global climate justice, then the political \naspirations of the authors may well find resonance outside the academy. These are fine books \ndemonstrating that, to make sense of the social and ecological irrationalities of capitalism, it is still necessary \nto look Marx in the face. \n \nReferences \nDavison, P., 2006.
