Furthermore, exposure of the LB films to a wide range of vapours (e.g.\namines, alcohols, thiols) has led to modified UV-visible spectra.\n1. Introduction\nCalix[4]resorcinarene derivatives in the form of\nthin films are of particular interest within the sens-\ning community due to their selective recognition of\ndifferent molecules. Films of controlled thickness\nof these calix[4]resorcinarenes can be created us-\ning the Langmuir-Blodgett technique[1]. Different\ncalixresorcinarene derivatives have been deposited\nonto varying substrates as thin films by the LB\ntechnique which were then used as chemical sen-\nsors[2]. The cavity of the resorcinarene provides\na site for the binding of organic guest molecular\nspecies [3] and the selectivity of the resorcinarene\nto particular analytes can be controlled somewhat\nby altering the size of the cavity as well as the\nperipheral substituted groups. Most commonly,\nthe cavity size corresponds to n= 4, 6 or 8. A wide\nrange of analyte species has been previously stud-\nied including metal ions [4] and amino acids [5].\nVarious analytical techniques have been used to\nfollow the sensing response including UV-visible\nspectroscopy [6], surface plasmon resonance [7]\nand quartz crystal resonance [8].\n2. Materials\nIn this work, two calix[4]resorcinarenes have been\nstudied in solution, Langmuir film and LB film\nform. The chemical structures of these materials,\nCalix 1 and Calix 2, are shown in Figure 1. The ma-\nterials were first dissolved in chloroform, and then\nfor isotherm and LB film studies they were spread\nover the water surface to form floating Langmuir\nfilms. These materials used are both coloured and\nit is thought that this colour is the result of intra-\nmolecular charge transfer bands.\nBoth these materials are amphiphilic and so are ex-\npected to formwell ordered Langmuir films. Awide\nrange of acids, amines and thiols used as analytes\nhave been exposed to the calix[4]resorcinarenes.\nThe analytes used were acetic acid, ethyl acetate,\nhexanethiol, hexylamine, octanol, octanal, octy-\nlamine, triethylamine, trimethylphosphate and\nthree amino acids. The amino acids used were\nlysine, alanine and glutamic acid. These were cho-\nsen because of their acidic or basic nature, lysine\nbeing basic, glutamic acid being acidic and ala-\nnine being neutral. By investigating such a large\nnumber of analytes, the degree of selectivity of\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Science 22 February 2008\nFig. 1. Chemical structure of the calix[4]resorcinarenes\neach calix[4]resorcinarene can be established.\n3. Experimental Details\n3.1. LB film production\nChloroform solutions of the calix[4]resorcinarenes\nwere produced, the concentrations used were 0.292\ng\/l and 1.093 g\/l for Calix 1 and 2 respectively. A\nvolume of 50\u00b5l of the solution was spread, using\na syringe, onto the surface of the water subphase\n(\u300915M\u2126cm) within a NIMA Langmuir-Blodgett\ntrough (Type 611). A period of 10 minutes was\ngiven to allow any excess chloroform to evaporate\noff the surface before the compression was initi-\nated. The speed of the compression was set to\n40cm2 min\u22121.\nUsing the LB technique 20 layers of each of the ma-\nterials were transferred onto a clean, hydrophobic\nglass substrate. The surface pressure of the mate-\nrial was held constant at 15mN\/m and when this\npressure was attained the deposition process was\ninitiated at a speed of 5mm\/min.\nFor the investigation into the calix[4]resorcinarene\ninteraction with the amino acids, the amino acids\nwere first dissolved in water. The amino acids were\nadded to the subphase after the material had been\nspread and the 10 minutes evaporation time had\nelapsed. The amino acids were introduced to the\nsubphase outside of the area confined by the barri-\ners, in order not to disturb the floating layer. The\ntrough used had a volume of 350ml and the amount\nof amino acid solution placed into the subphase\nwas sufficient to produce a concentration of 0.01\nM for each material.\n3.2. Spectroscopy\nUV-visible spectra of the materials were recorded\nafter they had been deposited onto glass sub-\nstrates. These spectra were obtained using the\nSpectromate micro spectrophotometer (World\nPrecision Instruments). When the spectra had\nbeen recorded, the substrate was then immersed\nin a 0.01 M solution of each amino acid for 30\nminutes. Following this process, the spectra of the\nsamples were monitored again.\nSolution spectroscopy of these two materials was\nalso performed using the Ocean Optics UV-Vis\nlightsource (Model: Mini-D2) and spectrometer\n(USB2000) with a wavelength range 179nm -\n876nm. The concentrations used for this process\nwere 0.052 g\/l and 0.055 g\/l for calix 1 and 2 re-\nspectively. A quartz cuvette was used and 850\u00b5l of\nthe soultions were placed within it. The sectrum\nwas first taken and then the solution was mixed\n100\u00b5l of each nine different analytes and then\nspectra readings were repeated.\n4. Results and discussion\n4.1. Surface Pressure-Area Isotherms\nIsotherms of both Calix 1 and 2 were recorded\non a Langmuir trough (Type 601BAM). The ex-\npected approximate area per molecule for the\ncalix[4]resorcinare unit is in the range 1.2 -\n1.3 nm2. Therefore, the extrapolated area per\nmolecule measured for Calix 1 (1.1 nm2) sug-\ngests that a monolayer is formed at the air-water\ninterface. The corresponding value for Calix 2\nis 0.75 nm2, indicating most probably that this\ncalix[4]resorcinarene is aggregating in the spread-\ning solution to a greater extent than that of Calix\n1.\nAfter the subphase had been doped with amino\nacids, several of the isotherms showed differences\nfrom their original form. The results of each of the\nisotherms from the three amino acids can be seen\nin Figure 2.\n2\nFig. 2. Isotherms before and after doping the water sub-\nphase with various amino acids, showing their effects on\na) Calix 1 and b) Calix 2\nWhile studying Calix 1, the suphase was first\ndoped with alanine. However with this amino acid\nthere was no noticeable change to the isotherm\ncurve. Similarly when the subphase was doped\nwith glutamic acid no change in the isotherm\ncurve was present. When lysine was added to the\nsubphase, there was a distinct modification to\nthe isotherm. The intial increase in surface pres-\nsure, the phase change from the gaseous to the\nsolid phase, occurred for a much higher area per\nmolecule. This change showed that Calix 1 had\ninteracted with lysine on the water surface and\nhad caused an apparent expansion of the film on\nthe surface.\nCalix 2 did not follow the same trend as Calix 1,\nshowing interactions with each of the three amino\nacids. The area per molecule at the point where the\nsurface pressure rises above 0mN\/m for each of the\nthree amino acids. However the changes were less\nsignificant than for Calix 1. The greatest change\nwas again caused by the doping the water with\nlysine and alanine produced the least reaction on\nthe water surface.\n4.2. Solution Spectroscopy\nBoth of the calix[4]resorcinarenes under discussion\nwere then investigated to determine their possible\nuse as sensors for the range of analytes mentioned\nin section 2. This was initially carried out with the\nmaterials in a solution of chloroform. Spectra of\nCalix 1 and 2 were taken in solution before and\nafter their exposure to these analytes. Examples\nFig. 3. Absorbance spectra of Calix 1 solution before and\nafter the addition of octylamine\nFig. 4. Absorbance spectra of Calix 2 solution before and\nafter the addition of acetic acid\nof the changes caused by introducing the analyte\nwhich caused the largest change in the spectra of\ncalix 1 and 2 are shown in figure 3 and figure 4 re-\nspectively. The reduction in the adsorption inten-\nsity around 525nm in figure 3 is thought to occur\nas a result of the adsorption of amine which may\nhinder the intra-molecular charge transfer process.\nThe resulting absorbance changes, between 350nm\n- 650nm, for both Calix 1 and 2 for each of the\nanalytes used can be seen in Figure 5.\nFig. 5. Differences in the absorbance spectra squared of the\nsolutions in the wavelength region between 350nm-650nm\nWhen studying Calix 1, three of the analytes used\nresulted in a distinct change in the spectra of\nthe material; triethylamine, octylamine and hexy-\nlamine. Other analytes such as trimethylphos-\n3\nphate and hexanethiol produced a lesser change\nin the spectra also. These effects show that Calix\n1 is sensitive to the presence of amines. The sensi-\ntivity of Calix 1 to amines is due to the fact that\nthis calix contains eight phenolic hydroxyl groups\nwhich have a pKa of approximately 9-10 [9][10].\nHowever only four of these can be deprotonated,\nmuch more drastic conditions are required to re-\nmove any more protons. Addition of basic species\nsuch as amines causes formation of charged phe-\nnolic groups, thereby affecting the spectrum.\nAs our results show, Calix 2 is sensitive to acetic\nacid but is insensitive to the presence of amines\nwhereas the opposite is true for Calix 1. Calix 2 also\nreacted, but with a much smaller response, when\nmixed with hexanethiol. Calix 2 contains both hy-\ndroxyl and amine groups. It is thought that within\nthis system, self-protonation occurs where four of\nthe hydroxyl groups protonate the amine groups\n[11]. Since this system is inherently already depro-\ntonated, it follows that addition of further amines\nwill only have minimal effects since they are not\nstrong enough bases to remove any of the remain-\ning four hydroxyl protons. However since acetic\nacid is more acidic than phenolic groups, addition\nof the acid reprotonates the hydroxyls, again lead-\ning to changes in the sectrum.\n4.3. LB film spectroscopy\nSamples were made from Calix 1 and 2 that con-\nsisted of 20 layers on a side of the glass substrate.\nAfter recording the initial spectra, the samples\nwere then immersed in a solution of each amino\nacid, again with a concentration of 0.01 M. The\nspectra were then recorded again. The resulting\nchanges in the spectra from this process can be\nseen in Figure 6.\nFig. 6. Differences in the absorbance spectra squared of\nthe 20 LB layer samples in the wavelength region between\n350nm-650nm\nThe changes observed for Calix 1 are in agree-\nment with the isotherm work previously discussed.\nBoth alanine and glutamic acid produced almost\nno change in the spectra recorded. Lysine produced\nthe greatest change in the observed spectra, which\nis in excellent agreement with the isotherm results.\nThe differences observed in the for Calix 2 spec-\ntra are also in agreement with the results from the\nisotherm work. These changes are much less pro-\nnounced in comparison to the changes produced\nwith Calix 1.\n5. Conclusions\nThe sensing behaviour of two calix[4]resorcinarenes\nhas been characterised in terms of modifications\nto their surface pressure - area isotherms, their\nUV-visible solution and LB film spectra, for a wide\nrange of analytes. In particular, LB films of Calix\n1 has proved to bind selectively to lysine, an im-\nportant amino acid. This is not the first time that\nstrong interactions have been observed between\ncalix-type molecules and amino acids. Selkti et al\n[12] described the binding of lysine by a sulfona-\ntocalix[4]arene although this was not in LB film\nform. An attempt was made to investigate the\ninteraction between the calix[4]resorcinarenes and\nthe amino acids in solution, it was thought that\nethanol would be suitable but the amino acids\nwould not fully dissolve in the solvent. Further to\nthis work studies will be carried out into the re-\nactions occuring between LB films of both of the\ncalix[4]resorcinarenes to a more extensive range of\nanalytes including additional amino acids.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank the EPRSC for financial\nsupport.\nReferences\n[1] A.V.
