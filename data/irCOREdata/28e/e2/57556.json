We find that delayed flowpaths \nthrough ice-marginal talus and moraine sediments are critical for the acquisition of \nsolute from rock minerals because delayed flowpaths through subglacial sediments \nare absent beneath this small, cold-based glacier. Here the mechanisms of weathering \nare similar to those reported in subglacial environments, and include sub-oxic \nconditions in the early summer and increasingly oxic conditions thereafter. Up to 85 \n% of the NO3\n-\n and 65 % of the SO4\n2-\n are most likely produced by bacterially-mediated \nreactions in the ice marginal sediments, which is remarkable given the overwhelming \nsupply of these solutes from marine sources. However, reactive pyrite phases are \nrestricted in the host rocks, limiting the export of Fe, SO4\n2-\n and cations that may be \nremoved by weathering once pyrite oxidation has taken place. These factors mean that \ndissolution of Ca\n2+\n and Na\n+\n from carbonate and silicate minerals dominate, producing \nmoderate cationic denudation yields from Tuva Glacier (163 *meq\n+\n m\n-2 \na\n-1\n) \ncompared to a global range of values (94 - 4200 *meq\n+\n km\n-2 \na\n-1\n). \n \nIntroduction \nStudies of the composition of runoff from Antarctica are very sparse, a limitation that \nis only partly justified by the fact that this is the coldest, driest continent on Earth. \nLogistical difficulties are also very significant and so we have a far from complete \nunderstanding of the biogeochemical processes that are activated following melt. To \ndate, the biogeochemistry of lakes is far better understood than runoff: both from a \n 3 \nprocess perspective and from a geographical one (see Vincent et al, 2008). Most \nresearch attention has been given to the geochemistry of Victoria Land (e.g. Borghini \nand Bargagli, 2004; De Mora et al, 1991) and in particular its McMurdo Dry Valleys \n(e.g. Green et al, 1988; Nezat et al, 2001; Lyons et al, 2003; McKnight et al, 2008 and \nreferences therein). The remote, dry location of these valleys means that \ndiscontinuous flowpaths and sporadic runoff events dominate. The low levels of \nprecipitation also mean that runoff from glacial meltwaters is most important, and a \nnumber of papers have described their biogeochemistry as a result (Tranter et al, \n2002; Fortner et al, 2005). Once such runoff leaves the glacier, there is a significant \neffect from biogeochemical cycling within the hyporheic zone and more distant soils, \nwhere evaporation leads to the formation and subsequent dissolution of secondary \nsalts (Gooseff et al, 2002; Nezat et al, 2001).  \n \nThe bias that results from the success of the McMurdo Dry Valley research site needs \nto be addressed, because virtually nothing is known about the geochemistry of runoff \nfrom the Antarctic Peninsula and its islands. Here one has to resort to studies of lake \ninflow waters and occasional spatial sampling campaigns to acquire a rudimentary \nunderstanding of the processes that operate (e.g. Caulkett and Ellis-Evans, 1997;  \nHodgson et al, In Press). We believe this is a significant oversight because it is here \nthat rapid climate warming is forcing extremely rapid responses from ecosystems at \nthe ice margin (Quayle et al, 2002). Nutrient provision from snowmelt, ground thaw, \nrock-water interaction and marine fauna appear to have a marked effect by enhancing \nnutrient availability following melt (Quayle et al, 2002; Hodson, 2006). The climate is \nalso more conducive to condensation than evaporation, so that the production of \n 4 \nsecondary minerals is more likely to be due to the incongruent dissolution of primary \nminerals than evaporate formation.  \nMore data sets from the Antarctic Peninsula are therefore urgently required. The \npurpose of this paper is therefore to help address this need by examining solute \nacquisition following rock-water contact in a small glacial catchment upon Signy \nIsland of the South Orkney Island group. A combination of geochemical and stable \nisotope tracers are employed to characterise the capacity of glacial runoff to acquire \nnew nutrients from crustal sources, and thus fertilise marine ecosystems known for \ntheir Fe-limitation (Watson et al, 2000). The efficacy of chemical denudation will also \nbe assessed through comparison with a global glacial data set. \n \n \nField Site \nResearch was undertaken in a small glacier basin (unofficial name: Tuva Glacier) that \nforms an outlet of the Signy Island ice cap in the maritime Antarctic (South Orkney \nIslands: Figure 1). The catchment ranges from sea level to ca. 250 m altitude, is \ncomposed of  meta-sedimentary rocks (mostly schists but with some marble and \namphibolites: see Mathews and Maling, 1967) and is 1.01 km\n2\n in area (to Site Q1, \ninstalled at ca. 50 m altitude). The glacier is almost certainly cold-based and offers no \nrock-water contact at the glacier bed. Snowmelt therefore supplies runoff to high \nrock-water contact zones in the talus and moraines that flank the valley sides. Snow \nand glacier melt almost entirely runs off via the south west margin, much of which is \nrouted through a small lake next to the end moraine on its way to Site Q2. Otherwise, \na very small stream (< 10% of total glacial runoff) drains along northern margin of the \n 5 \nglacier. Runoff from all parts of the forefield also contributes to the proglacial stream \nbetween Sites Q2 and Q1 downstream. Here flow through a series of icings and then \nboulder-filled channels takes place. More insights into the hydrological dynamics of \nthe system are available from Hodson (2006), who provides a water balance. This \nindicated an annual specific runoff of 0.53 m a\n-1\n for the water year under study \n(2003\/04), demonstrating the significance of the melting that takes place in this part of \nAntarctica. \nSamples were collected for chemical and isotopic measurements from across the \ncatchment between November 13\nth\n, 2003 (Day of Year 317) and March 21\nst\n, 2004 \n(DOY 81). This interval encompassed the entire runoff season, although isotope \nsamples could not be collected after January 8\nth\n, 2004. The stable isotopic data \ntherefore describe an early low flow phase of the runoff season, allowing the \nparticular emphasis to be given to the first stages of rock-water-organism interaction \nfollowing snowmelt. \n \nMethods \nHydrochemical sampling \nA comprehensive programme of snow, ice, bulk deposition, snow melt and runoff \nsampling was undertaken and has already been described by Hodson (2006). \nHowever, here we report new data from zones of high rock-water contact and present \nthe stable isotopic composition of all sample types for the first time. Figure 1 shows \nthe location of these sites. Bulk snow samples that were taken for chemical and stable \nisotopic characterisation were collected from four pits down the glacier centre line (S1 \nto S4 in Figure 1) between 13\nth\n and 29\nth\n November (prior to runoff) and stored in pre-\n 6 \ncleaned plastic bags prior to melting in a water bath and filtration through a 0.45 \u00b5m \nhigh capacity Gelman filter. Proglacial river samples were collected and filtered \nalmost immediately through a Nalgene filter unit with 0.45 \u00b5m cellulose nitrate \nmembrane at Sites Q1 and Q2 (see Figure 1) between November 24h and March 21st, \n2004. These dates encompass the entire runoff monitoring period, the earliest being \ntaken after digging through to the base of the snowpack. In addition, when melting \nconditions were favourable, samples were also collected from moraines and talus \ndeposits along the margin of the glacier (Sites T1, T2 and M1, M2 respectively).  \n \nStable isotope sampling \nFor \n15\nN\/\n14\nN, \n34\nS\/\n32\nS and \n18\nO\/\n16\nO analysis of NH4\n+\n, NO3\n-\n, and SO4\n2-\n 25 kg of snow or \nwater were collected from 4 bulk snowpack samples (S1 \u2013 S4, see above), a snow \nmelt sample from above and within a basal slush zone at S1; eight proglacial river \nsamples (four each at Sites Q1 and Q2) and single samples from Sites M1, M2, T1 \nand T2. Snowpack samples represented the complete section of snow down to the \nglacier surface, melted at 20\no\nC. After 0.45 \u00b5m pressure filtering, samples were \nstripped of organics, cations and anions by passage through ISOLUTE Env\n+\n \n(International Sorbent Technology), and AG50W-X8 and AG2-X8 (Bio-Rad) resins \n(Heaton et al., 2004; Wynn et al., 2006,7). Untreated samples were collected for \n2\nH\/\n1\nH and \n18\nO\/\n16\nO analysis of water. \nDIC (dissolved inorganic carbon) for \n13\nC\/\n12\nC analysis was collected as barium \ncarbonate by addition of alkaline barium chloride to samples of occasional runoff at \nthe Sites Q1 and Q2, and spot samples at sites M1, M2, T1 and T2. The waters \n 7 \ndisplayed no turbidity, and so they were not filtered prior to addition of barium \nchloride, avoiding possible loss of CO2. \n \nHydrological Monitoring \nHourly records of runoff (derived from a Druck pressure transducer), electrical \nconductivity and temperature measurements (Campbell 247 sensor) were collected at \nthe proglacial river the Site Q1. At Site Q2, just electrical conductivity and water \ntemperature records were collected. Pressure records were calibrated using the \nvelocity area method and several different pressure-discharge rating curves with \nstandard errors between 5 and 15 % of mean discharge (see Hodson, 2006). We \nestimated from visual observations and three velocity-area discharge measurements \nthat flow through the Site Q2 typically contributed 85% of the flow through Site Q1.  \nA runoff time series at the Site Q2 was therefore constructed from 0.85 times the \ndischarge at Site Q1. \n \nAnalytical methods \nChemical analyses were either undertaken in Signy (NH4\n+\n and NO3\n-\n) or the UK (all \nother tests) using protocols described in detail by Hodson (2006). Briefly, major \ncations were determined using either emission mode (Na\n+\n, K\n+\n) or absorption mode \n(Ca\n2+\n, Mg\n2+\n) atomic absorption spectroscopy following acidification with 2% HNO3 \nand the addition of caesium chloride and lanthanum chloride for emission mode and \nabsorption mode respectively. Dissolved silica was determined colourimetrically \nusing the manual method molybdenum blue method reported by APHA (1995) and \nwith a detection limit of 0.02 mg L\n-1\n. The precision errors for all cation and Si \n 8 \ndeterminations were < 5 %. Cl\n-\n and SO4\n2-\n were quantified using a Dionex ICS2500 \nion chromatograph after two - four months\u2019 dark, cool (4oC) storage. Precision errors \nwere 7 % and 6 % at 40 \u00b5g L\n-1\n respectively. At Signy, and usually within 2 days of \ncollection, we employed manual colorimetric tests for NH4\n+\n (after Mackareth et al, \n1978), and an automated Cd-Cu reduction, N-1-napthylethylenediamine procedure for \nNO3\n-\n (using a Skalar Autoanalyser). Detection limits were ca. 3 \u00b5gN L\n-1\n for both \ndeterminations, whilst precision errors were + 10 % for NH4\n+\n and + 5 % or less for \nNO3\n-\n (Hodson, 2006). Tests of pH and HCO3\n-\n were also undertaken at Signy, making \nuse of a Hach pH electrode calibrated with pH4 and 7 buffer solutions and alkalinity \ntitration, making use of 1 mM HCl and BDH mixed indicator (endpoint pH 4.5). \nPrecision errors were 0.1 pH unit and 5% (HCO3\n-\n) respectively.  \n \nStable Isotope Analysis \nResin columns were eluted using 1M hydrobromic acid, with NH4\n+ \nprocessed to \nammonium sulfate by the diffusion method, SO4\n2- \nrecovered as barium sulfate, and \nNO3\n- \nprocessed to silver nitrate (Sigman et al., 1997; Chang et al., 1999; Hwang et al., \n1999; Heaton et al., 2001, 2004; Wynn et al., 2005, 2006). \n15\nN\/\n14\nN, \n34\nS\/\n32\nS and \n18\nO\/\n16\nO ratios, together with nitrate N\/O atomic ratios , were determined by oxidative \nor reductive pyrolysis in elemental analysers coupled to a mass spectrometer (TC\/EA-\nConfloIII-Delta+XL system, ThermoFinnigan, Bremen, Germany). Values for \n15\nN \nversus AIR, \n34\nS versus CDT, and \n18\nO versus SMOW were calculated by \ncomparison with laboratory standards calibrated against international standards \nassuming: IAEA-N-1 \n15\nN = +0.4\u2030; NBS 127 34S = +20.3\u2030, 18O = +9.3\u2030; \n 9 \nIAEA-NO-3 \n18O = +25.6\u2030. The precision errors of laboratory standards (1 standard \ndeviation) were < 0.3\u2030 for 15N and 34S, and < 0.5\u2030 for 18O. \n2\nH\/\n1\nH ratios of water were determined by chromium reduction to hydrogen (Morrison \net al., 2001) in a PyrOH elemental analyser (EuroVector, Milan) on-line to an \nIsoprime mass spectrometer (GV Instruments, Manchester, England), and \n18\nO\/\n16\nO \nratios of water by equilibration with CO2 (Epstein and Mayeda, 1953) in an Isoprep-\n18 online to a SIRA II mass spectrometer (VG Instruments, Middlewich, England). \nValues for \n2\nH and \n18\nO versus VSMOW were calculated by comparison with \nlaboratory standards calibrated against VSMOW and SLAP. Precision of laboratory \nstandards (1 SD) was \u2264 1\u2030 for 2H and \u2264 0.03\u2030 for 18O. \nBarium carbonate from DIC was reacted with phosphoric acid and the liberated CO2 \nanalysed in an Optima dual-inlet mass spectrometer (VG Instruments, Middlewich, \nEngland). Values for \n13\nC versus PDB were calculated by comparison with laboratory \nstandards calibrated against NBS 19 and NBS 18 assuming NBS 18 \n13\nC = -5.1\u2030. \nPrecision of laboratory standards (1 SD) was \u2264 0.1\u2030. \n \nCorrection of \u03b418ONO3 for organic matter \nAs in previous polar studies, contamination by dissolved organics caused problems \nfor \n18\nONO3 analysis using the silver nitrate method (Heaton et al, 2004; Wynn et al, \n2006, 2007; Tye and Heaton, 2007). In this study the problem was particularly severe \nfor the snowpit samples. We therefore estimated the \n18\nO value of the contaminant by \nregression analysis of the measured \n18\nO value of the contaminated silver nitrate \nagainst its N\/O atomic ratio. The contaminant \n18\nO value was identified by the origin \nof the X axis because analysis of the organics trapped on the Env\n+\n resin suggested that \n 10 \nit contained no nitrogen. Since the \n18\nONO3 value for the uncontaminated end-member \ncan be assumed to be similar for all the snow-pits, and the N\/O atomic ratio is 0.33 for \npure nitrate, we were then able to correct each sample using its N\/O atomic ratio \n(below). The regression model is shown in Figure 2, and indicates a contaminant \n18\nO \nvalue (i.e. N\/O = 0) of +14.5\u2030, and a pure nitrate end-member (i.e. N\/O = 0.33) of \n+49.5 \u2030. This latter value is slightly lower than the range reported for nitrate aerosols \nat a coastal Antarctic station (Savarino et al., 2007). \n18\nONO3 values corrected for contamination were therefore calculated from the \nmeasured \n18\nO values for silver nitrate, \n18\nOmeasured, using: \n18\nONO3 = (\n18\nOmeasured - forganic\u00b714.5) \/ (1 - forganic)     1) \nwhere the fraction of organic contaminant, forganic = 1 \u2013 [(N\/O)measured\/0.33]  2) \nCorrected \n18\nONO3 values are shown together with \n18\nOmeasured values in Table 3. With \nthe exception of samples with high levels of contamination (N\/O atomic ratios below \n0.1), which are subject to large correction errors, corrected \n18\nONO3 values are used \nthroughout the rest of this paper. \n \nCorrection for marine salts \nIn order to establish the dynamics of rock weathering, estimates of non-snowpack \nsolute concentrations were estimated for each sample. The concentrations of all \ncations, SO4\n2-\n, NH4\n+\n and NO3\n-\n derived from non-snowpack sources were therefore \ndefined thus: \n*X = X \u2013 aCl-          3) \n 11 \nWhere *X is the non-snowpack concentration of solute X and a is the ratio of solute X \nto Cl\n-\n in bulk snowpack and snowmelt (from a lysimeter at Site S1) in Tuva Glacier \nbasin, as reported by Hodson (2006). However, for NO3\n-\n and NH4\n+\n only pre-melt bulk \nsnowpack data were used to define a (the values being 0.0051 and 0.0072) on account \nof the fact that microbial assimilation of these ions affected the ratios in the snowmelt \n(Hodson, 2006). Inclusion of the snowmelt samples in the estimation procedure (for \nions other than NO3\n-\n and NH4\n+\n) was important because it allowed us to use data that \nspanned a far greater range of concentrations than that afforded by just the bulk snow \nsamples. Such a range was necessary due to the strong elution process that occurred \nduring snowmelt, which caused early runoff to be markedly more concentrated than \nthe snowpack (see Hodson, 2006). Interestingly, however, the preferential elution of \ncertain solutes over Cl\n-\n was found to be negligible according to this work, giving \nmuch confidence in our ability to remove the large snowpack-derived contribution of \nthe solutes using these Cl\n-\n ratios.  \nThe liberation of solute from non-snowpack sources was further characterised at a \ndaily time step by estimating fluxes of *X (in g d\n-1\n) from the product of daily runoff \nvolume and non-snowpack solute concentration. Where necessary, linear interpolation \nwas used to fill in any gaps in the concentration series and produce a daily time series \n(see Hodson, 2006). The annual fluxes (Ftot) of *X were then estimated using: \n \nni\ni\nidtottot XQF\n1\n*\n \n \n(4 \nwhere Ftot = total solute flux (g); \nQdtot  = total discharge for individual days (m\n3\n day\n-1\n); \n 12 \n*Xi = non-snowpack concentration of single daily sample (mg L\n-1\n). \nn  = number of days in observation period. \nThe fluxes (g a\n-1\n) of *Ca\n2+\n, *Mg\n2+\n, *Na\n+\n, *K\n+\n *NH4\n+\n, *NO3\n-\n and *SO4\n2-\n were then \ntransformed into mass yields (kg km\n-2\n a\n-1\n) and cation yields ( *M\n+\n m\n-2\n a\n-1\n) in order to \ncompare the results of this work with other studies, including the more detailed mass \nbalance results presented by Hodson (2006) for Tuva Glacier. Since neither Si nor \nHCO3- were detected in the snowpack, their total runoff yields were estimated \ninstead. \n \nResults \nNon-snowpack solute transfer \nFigure 3 shows the discharge and daily concentrations of total snowpack and non-\nsnowpack cation concentrations (\nsnow\nM\n+\n and *M\n+\n respectively). A distinct seasonal \nhydrograph is evident, with an early season low flow phase (prior to 7\nth\n December, \n2003), a mid-season high flow phase thereafter (until 28\nth\n January) and a final low \nflow phase until 22\nnd\n March, 2004. Both sources of cations declined throughout these \nstages of the runoff season. However, the importance of *M\n+\n grew throughout the \nsummer and even exceeded \nsnow\nM\n+\n after 11\nth\n February, 2004 at Site Q1. Figure 4 \npresents the cumulative fluxes of \nsnow\nM\n+\n and *M\n+\n. The first 50% of \nsnow\nM\n+\n was \ntransported by the first 25% of runoff and thus typical of a strong snowpack elution \nprocess (see Hodson, 2006). By contrast, the first 50% of *M\n+\n required 70% of the \ntotal annual runoff, illustrating the importance of rock-water contact later in the \nablation period. However, concentrations of *M\n+\n were still significant in the early low \nflow phase, suggesting that rock-water interaction cannot be discounted in the early \n 13 \nablation period. Figure 3B also shows that dissolved Si concentrations were \nsignificant early on, even reaching seasonal maximum values in the very first \nsamples. Since the concentrations were initially highest at the Site Q2, the source of \nions was not the ablation of the small icings in the proglacial forefield, as has been \nobserved in the Arctic (e.g. Hodgkins et al, 1998). \nTable 1 shows the yields of non-snowpack ions, Si and HCO3\n-\n. The non-snowpack \nyields are also compared to estimates produced by Hodson (2006), who used summer \nbulk deposition estimates and changes in snow pack water equivalent and chemistry \n(rather than ratios to Cl\n-\n) to remove atmospheric solute inputs. Solute mass export \nfrom non-snowpack solute sources appears to be dominated by HCO3\n-\n, *Na\n+\n and then \n*Ca\n2+\n. When all concentrations are combined, chemical denudation estimates of 5.2 \nand 6.8 tons km\n-2\n a\n -1\n  are evident for the Q2 and Q1 catchments respectively, if rock \nweathering is assumed to account for all non-snowpack solute delivery except *NO3\n-\n \nand *NH4\n+\n. No attempt here has been made to assess the HCO3\n-\n derived from organic \nand atmospheric sources and so more appropriate measures for assessing the efficacy \nof chemical denudation might be the equivalent cation yields, which were 160 and \n130 meq m\n-2\n a\n-1\n for Sites Q1 and Q2. The ratio Q2\/Q1 for the *X yields is also shown \nin Table 1 as a proxy for solute sources and sinks in the glacier forefield. Values < 1 \nreveal that the glacial forefield, which showed little evidence of recent glaciation, \nplays an important role in moderating *X transfer to the coast. Thus *NH4\n+\n \nsequestration, *NO3\n-\n production and chemical denudation (all cations and *SO4\n2-\n) are \ndistinct features of these ratios, whilst HCO3\n-\n yields appear unchanged. \n \nCation composition \n 14 \nWhen expressed in equivalent units, seasonal changes in the cation composition of \nrunoff at the Site Q1 reveals quasi-stable concentrations of *K\n+\n and *Mg\n2+\n, sharply \nincreasing *Na\n+\n concentrations, and decreasing *Ca\n2+\n concentrations (Figure 3). This \nresults in *Ca\n2+\n being the dominant ion in the early low flow period, and *Na\n+\n \ndominating the remainder of the observation period. The same pattern can be inferred \nfrom Site Q2 cation series, although the decrease in *Ca\n2+\n is more pronounced. \nHowever, the variations in *Na\n+\n early in the observation period may be erroneous on \naccount of this being the stage of the ablation season when marine sources of Na\n+\n \nwere of greatest importance. Any errors in the marine salt correction for Na\n+\n would \ntherefore have greatest impact here, although such an error would result in different \n*Na\n+\n yields to those reported by Hodson (2006) in Table 1, which is clearly not the \ncase. We therefore propose that *Na\n+\n acquisition from crustal sources is indeed a \nmajor process occurring in the Tuva Glacier system. Lastly, concentrations of *Na\n+\n, \n*Ca\n2+\n and *Mg\n2+\n were highest at Site Q1 by the end of the observation period and so \nwe also suggest that the enhancement of non-snowpack solute acquisition in the \nglacier forefield largely occurred later on in the ablation period.  \n \nMajor anion composition and CO2 partial pressures \nVariations in the molar ratio *SO4\n2-\n\/HCO3\n-\n at both Sites Q2 and Q1 reveals a change \nin the anion composition of runoff (Figure 5A). The *SO4\n2-\n\/HCO3\n-\n ratio was low at \nthe start of the runoff period, but increased rapidly until the onset of the high flow \nphase (7\nth\n December, 2003), when values fell abruptly. Thereafter the *SO4\n2-\n\/HCO3\n-\n \nratio began to recover during the late low flow phase around 5\nth\n February, 2004 (DOY \n36), especially at Site Q1. Figure 5B also presents the partial pressure of CO2 \n(hereafter expressed as log10 p(CO2)) which was estimated using Phreeqc speciation \n 15 \nmodelling (Parkhurst, 1995). The log10 p(CO2) values decreased throughout the early \nseason, especially following the onset of high flows on 7\nth\n December, 2003 (DOY \n341), reaching seasonal minimum values that were close to atmospheric equilibrium \n(i.e. ca. 10\n-3.5\n atmospheres) in mid-January, 2004. The high log10 p(CO2) and low \n*SO4\n2-\n\/HCO3\n-\n ratio at both sites during the early season low flow phase therefore \nidentify an additional source of HCO3\n-\n to runoff early in the summer that diminishes \nin importance as runoff increases. Later on in the summer, the increase in both log10 \np(CO2) and *SO4\n2-\n\/HCO3\n-\n appears more significant at Site Q1, suggesting that \nprocesses in the forefield were influencing both these terms. \n \nNitrogen biogeochemistry \nFigure 3 shows time series of *NH4\n+\n and *NO3\n-\n. The dynamics of these nutrients are \nbroadly similar at the Sites Q1 and Q2, showing a deficit (-ve values) of *NH4\n+\n during \nthe early low flow phase, when *NO3\n-\n concentrations were positive and quasi-stable. \nThe high flow phase in the middle of the observation period was characterised by \nlower *NO3\n-\n concentrations at Site Q2, whilst high values returned afterwards, \nreaching seasonal maximum values at Site Q1. However, *NH4\n+\n concentrations, \ndespite increasing progressively through the entire observation period, were low and \nonly reached values significantly above zero at Site Q2 after the high flow phase.  \n \nChemistry and Stable Isotopes of C,N,O and S \nTables 2 and 3 present the chemical and stable isotope data for snow, snowpack \nwater, runoff and spot water samples collected from the talus water and moraine \nwater. Averages of these data are also shown for bulk snow, runoff at Sites Q2 and Q1 \n 16 \nand combined talus\/moraine water in Figure 6. Snow samples show low \n15\nN values \nfor both NH4\n+\n and NO3\n-\n (although the latter also shows considerable variability), \nwhilst Q1 shows higher \n15\nN, especially in the case of NH4\n+\n. However, differences in \nthe stable isotope values for \n15\nN are minor, especially when compared to the \n18\nO-\nNO3\n-\n values. Quite stark differences between the corrected \n15\nN-NO3\n-\n of the snow and \nsnowmelt (Table 3) samples and their counterparts from Q1, Q2, M1, M2, T1 and T2 \nare apparent. These latter samples also produce the lowest \n34\nS (+9.5 + 2.8\u2030) and \n18\nO-SO4\n2-\n (+ 1.2 + 1.2\u2030), which are significantly different from the snow data \n(average \n34\nS = 19.3 + 0.28\u2030; average 18O-SO4\n2-\n = + 8.5 + 0.19\u2030). Low standard \ndeviations for Snow \n34\nS and \n18\nO-SO4\n2-\n (Figure 6) also indicate that SO4\n2-\n isotopes \ndisplayed the least spatial variation across the catchment snowpack. Values of \n13\nC \ncould not be defined for the snowpack due to low DIC. However, there are clear \ndifferences in the \n13\nC of other sample types, with significantly higher values in the \ntalus\/moraine water types. Lastly, \n18\nO values (for water) indicate that snowpack \nwaters are generally highest (average -11.0\u2030 + 0.84), whilst all other water types are \ntypically only 1 \u2030 lower. Thus there is no evidence of significant evaporative \nenrichment of waters in the high rock-water contact zones of the catchment, as is \nobserved in parts of continental Antarctica (Gooseff et al, 2002). \n \nDiscussion \nSeasonal melting, flowpaths and the concentrations of non-snowpack ions \nThe data presented above describe a catchment that maintained a high degree of snow \ncover throughout the runoff season. A modest quantity of runoff was observed (ca. \n0.53 m a\n-1\n  according to Hodson (2006)), the vast majority of which was snowmelt, \n 17 \nrather than ice melt and rainfall. The seasonal hydrograph presented in Figure 3 \nclearly shows the dominance of the high flow phase between the 7\nth\n and 28\nth\n January, \n2004, when p(CO2) values moved closer to equilibrium and *SO4\n2-\n\/HCO3\n-\n ratios \ndeclined (Figure 5). These peak flows were supplied by the meltwaters impounded for \nsome time within a small lake at the ice\/end moraine margin and described by Hodson \n(2006). The storage of these waters most likely enabled equilibration with \natmospheric CO2 conditions in a low rock-water contact environment, because these \nconditions prevailed at Sites Q2 and Q1 when these lake waters outburst into the \nstream. However, far more interesting geochemical conditions appear to exist before \nthis lake outburst, including high concentrations of non-snowpack ions,  p(CO2) \nvalues in excess of atmospheric equilibrium and increasing *SO4\n2-\n\/HCO3\n-\n ratios \nduring the early low flow phase. These are strongly diagnostic of solute acquisition \nalong flowpaths that afford extended rock-water contact, producing seasonal \nmaximum levels of dissolved Si on 27\nth\n December, 2003 (DOY 361) at Site Q2 in \nspite of levels of Si being below detection in even the most concentrated snowmelt \nsampled upon the glacier. Respiration of organic carbon along such flowpaths might \nalso explain the high p(CO2) conditions in this early runoff phase, although the \n13\nCDIC values do not support this (see below). Thus delayed flowpaths that afford \nintimate rock-water contact dominated runoff before the lake outburst. Direct field \nobservations showed that these were mostly due to snowmelt infiltration into \nmoraines and talus deposits along glacier margins (Figure 1). Further, the removal of \nthe snowcover and icings from the intervening forefield and proglacial water course \nbetween Sites Q2 and Q1 also coincided with noticeable inputs of rock weathering \nions, most notably during the late low flow phase (after 28\nth\n January, 2004). \nConcentration of many solutes therefore increased downstream during this interval. In \n 18 \nsummary, our data show that solute acquisition was initially most important in the \ntalus and moraine covered parts of the upper catchment and of increasing importance \nin the downstream forefield thereafter.  \n \nCarbonate weathering and its coupling to pyrite oxidation \nCarbonate weathering is a major solute source to runoff at retreating glacier margins \n(Wadham et al, 2001; Cooper et al, 2002; Anderson et al, 2000) which should, \ntherefore, be considered in the context of the present study. Potential sources of \ncarbonate for weathering in the Tuva Glacier basin include marbles that are dispersed \nas minor outcrops among the schists (Mathews and Maling, 1967). They have, \nhowever, been overlooked by Hall et al (1985), who conducted a dissolution \nexperiment with Signy Island schist powders and attributed the release of Ca\n2+\n to \nplagioclase instead. In his study, the dissolution of Ca\n2+\n-deficient rock powders from \na different part of the island was studied, producing solutions that were dominated by \n*Na\n+\n and also attributed to plagioclase. However, our own dissolution experiments, \nconducted in a closed system with two different schist-derived rock powders from the \nTuva Glacier end moraine produced clear evidence of carbonate dissolution (see \nTable 4) and calcite saturation according to Phreeq speciation modelling (data not \nshown). The high rock-water contact ratios of the dissolution experiments (10 g L\n-1\n) \nalmost certainly contributed to the saturation of calcite weathering products though, \nand it should be noted that Phreeq modelling indicated no saturation with respect to \ncalcite in water samples collected during field work. However, *Ca\n2+\n concentrations \nclearly suggest that carbonate dissolution is a significant early season reaction in the \npresent study, producing the second greatest cation yield after *Na (Table 1). Stable \nisotope data also reveal isotopically heavy \n13\nCDIC values in moraine and talus waters \n 19 \nthat are strongly diagnostic of carbonate weathering, because they are close to 0 \u2030 \nand all other samples with less evidence of rock-water contact are isotopically lighter \nthan the VPDB carbonate standard (Figure 6 and Table 3).  \nEquation 5 and Figure 5A suggest that the coupling of carbonate dissolution and \nsulphide oxidation is likely to be weak in the Tuva Glacier system, because low \n*SO4\n2-\n\/HCO3\n-\n molar ratios existed. According to Equation 5, ratios of 0.5 are to be \nexpected when carbonate dissolution in dilute waters neutralises all protons liberated \nby sulphide oxidation. Limited exposure or abundance of reactive sulphide mineral \nsurfaces might be responsible, as well as slow rates of production by mechanical \ncomminution (perhaps reflecting the lack of rock-water contact at the glacier bed). \nStudies from the cold-based Austre Br\u00f8ggerbreen glacier in Svalbard yielded similar, \nlow *SO4\n2-\n\/HCO3\n-\n ratios, despite the presence of sulphide minerals in the local rocks \n(Hodson et al, 2002). Elsewhere in glacial environments where temperate glaciers \noffer intimate contact along subglacial flowpaths, the *SO4\n2-\n\/HCO3\n-\n is much greater, \napproaching 0.5 in some cases (i.e. the stoichiometry of Equation 5: Tranter et al, \n1996). The dissolution results in Table 4 suggest that *SO4\n2-\n liberation produces low \n*SO4\n2-\n\/HCO3\n-\n ratios (0.03 or less) even when the rock-water contact ratio is high (10 \nmg L\n-1\n). This suggests that low S abundance in rocks is sufficient to explain the low \n*SO4\n2-\n\/HCO3\n-\n ratios in Tuva Glacier runoff.  A beta probe analysis of two Signy \nIsland powders using scanning electron microscopy and described in Hall et al (1985) \nalso supports this assertion, since levels of S were below detection in one sample and \njust 4% in another. However, a lack of information on the source of samples used for \nthis analysis make it difficult to place these data in the context of the present study.  \n4FeS2(s) + 16CaCO3(s) + 15O2(aq) + 14H2O(l) = 16Ca\n2+\n(aq) + 16HCO3\n-\n(aq) + 8SO4\n2-\n(aq) + 4Fe(OH)3(s) 5) \n 20 \nRe-wetting of the rock powders during our dissolution experiments demonstrated a \nmarked decrease in the liberation of SO4\n2-\n from the two different schist samples that \nwere considered (Table 4). This might indicate that dissolution of a non-renewable \nsource of *SO4\n2-\n such as marine salts or even secondary anhydrite was responsible for \n*SO4\n2-\n liberation, rather than sulphide oxidation. The formation of surficial secondary \nsalts following evaporitic concentration is well known in arid polar catchments (e.g. \nCooper et al, 2002; Miekeljohn and Hall, 1997) and should not be precluded in the \npresent study due to the high rates of marine salt deposition on the catchment \n(Hodson, 2006). Therefore, further confirmation of the process of sulphide oxidation \nwas sought using the stable isotopes. These data (Table 3) show high \n34\nSSO4 relative \nto the snowpack in talus and moraine waters, suggesting that the primary source of the \nS was indeed crustal, rather than marine. If marine sources of sulphate are assumed to \nhave \n34\nS values of ca. +19 to +20\u2030, as suggested by the snowpack values (which are \nclose to the average value of +21 \u2030 for ocean water SO4\n2-\n: Rees et al, 1978), then \nmarine sulphate appears dominant in the proglacial stream waters (Q1 and Q2) which \nhave similarly high \n34\nS values. In contrast, a greater proportion of *SO4\n2-\n is indicated \nfor the talus\/moraine waters due to their higher SO4\n2-\n\/Cl\n-\n ratios, and significantly \nlower \n34\nS values. Simple mass balance calculations according to Equation 3 \nsuggested that the proportion of *SO4\n2-\n lay between 60 and 80% of the total for these \nisotopically distinct samples (Table 3). Since no sources of *SO4\n2-\n other than pyrite \nexist within the host rocks, we can thus attribute the primary source of *SO4\n2-\n in our \nrunoff samples and dissolution experiments to the oxidation of sulphides with some \nconfidence. The process is most likely limited by low abundance in these rocks and \nmight also be limited by slow reactive surface area regeneration (Brown et al, 1996). \n \n 21 \nFe and *SO4\n2-\n liberation: fingerprints of microbial weathering? \nThe presence of low yet detectable levels of *SO4\n2-\n from a probable sulphide source is \nsignificant for two key reasons. First it necessitates consideration of the potential for \nweathering to liberate Fe to runoff, and second it presents a basis for exploring \nwhether microbial activity plays a role in rock weathering reactions in Tuva Glacier \nbasin during the melt season. Continental Fe fertilisation of the Southern Ocean \necosystem is an important issue (e.g. Raiswell et al, 2006; Watson et al, 2000) and so \nlevels of dissolved Fe were determined opportunistically for a limited number of \nsamples using ICP MS (samples were acidified and the detection limit was 1 \u00b5g L\n-1\n: \nsee Table 5). These data clearly show levels of dissolved Fe close to detection in snow \nbut ca. 17 \u00b5g L\n-1\n in the moraine and talus waters. Dissolved Fe mobilisation therefore \ntakes place in high rock-water contact environments, but, according to Table 5, only \nproduces low concentrations in bulk runoff (ca. 3 \u00b5g L\n-1\n). Data on the Fe content of \nglacial runoff are sparse, having received detailed research attention in the first \ninstance from Mitchell et al (2001) in a study of Alpine glacial meltwaters (15 \u2013 1200 \n\u00b5g L\n-1\n, median 380 \u00b5g L\n-1\n). Yde et al (2004; 2005; In Press) described dissolved Fe \nconcentrations in three Greenland glacial catchments (30 \u2013 1800 \u00b5g L-1), whilst more \nrecently, Statham et al (2008) have assessed the Fe content of dilute runoff from part \nof the Greenland Ice Sheet. The latter found total dissolved Fe concentrations much \nlower than those reported by Yde et al (2004, 2005) at ~ 2.96 \u00b5g L\n-1\n, and thus almost \nidentical to the present study. These studies coupled with the above experimental \nevidence therefore suggest that relatively low dissolved Fe concentrations in bulk \nrunoff from Tuva Glacier are due to a combination of dilution by glacial meltwater \nand a lack of reactive pyrite and other Fe-bearing minerals along runoff flowpaths. \nHowever, the solubility of Fe in pH-neutral, oxygenated environments is also very \n 22 \nlow and so the higher concentrations in talus and moraine waters might indicate Fe \nliberation in anoxic weathering environments. We therefore used \n18\nOSO4 to consider \nwhether such conditions exist, following the rationale of Bottrell and Tranter (2002). \nThis defines a threshold value for \n18\nOSO4, \n18\nOthreshold, below which \n18\nOSO4 values \nsuggest production of *SO4\n2-\n in sub-oxic conditions:  \n\u03b418Othreshold = [(\u03b4\n18\nOatmosO2 \u2013 8.7) x 0.25] + (0.75 x \u03b4\n18\nOH2O)    6) \nwhere \u03b418OatmosO2 is the \u03b4\n18\nO of atmospheric O2 (+23.5\u2030 after Kroopnick and Craig, \n1972) and \u03b418OH2O is the \u03b4\n18\nO of water, defined by our own analyses. The calculation \nassumes that water is the only source of oxygen for sulphide oxidation under anoxic \nconditions, whilst both water and air O2 are available if oxic conditions prevail. An \nisotopic enrichment of -8.7\u2030 during the incorporation of O2 from the atmosphere and \ninto *SO4\n2-\n was also assumed. In the present study, for \u03b418OH2O = -11 to -13\u2030 (Table \n3), \u03b418Othreshold values were - 4.3 to -5.9\u2030 and so only the talus \n18\nOSO4 raw values lay \nclose to this threshold (Table 3). However, even in these samples, appreciable \nconcentrations of Cl\n-\n (see Table 3) indicate the presence of snowpack SO4\n2-\n, \nnecessitating the correction: \n\u03b418OSO4* = [\u03b4\n18\nOSO4 - (\u03b4\n18\nOSO4\nsnow\n \u00d7 fSO4\nsnow\n)] \/ (1-fSO4\nsnow\n)    7) \nWhere \u03b418OSO4* is the calculated value for *SO4\n2-\n (ie SO4\n2- \nproduced by weathering), \n\u03b418OSO4 and \u03b4\n18\nOSO4\nsnow\n are the measured values in the water and in snow, and fSO4\nsnow\n \nis the fraction of snowpack-derived SO4\n2-\n calculated using Equation 3. The values of \n\u03b418OSO4* are given in Table 3 and they are below \u03b4\n18\nOthreshold in the earliest samples of \nrunoff from Q1, Q2 and also in talus water (T1). Sub-oxic, microbially-mediated \nproduction of *SO4\n2-\n is therefore a distinct feature of rock-water contact early in the \nrunoff season. Presumably, the weathering regime changes as increasing quantities of \n 23 \nrunoff enter and oxygenate the flowpaths through the talus sediments. Such a process \ncould be critical for the delivery of oxidants to the weathering environment. This \npattern of *SO4\n2-\n production is rather like that inferred at Midtre Lov\u00e9nbreen, a \npolythermal Arctic glacier in schist bedrock described by Wynn et al (2006). \nHowever, in the present study, it is the talus and perhaps the ice-marginal moraines \nthat provide the loci for sulphide oxidation, albeit at a low rate. Similar characteristics \nof sulphide oxidation were also identified using these isotopes by Wadham et al\u2019s \n(2007) study of an Arctic glacier forefield characterised by reactive shale and \ncarbonate lithologies. In this study, the oxidation of sulphides under conditions of \nanoxia was assumed to be achieved by the following reaction: \nFeS2 + 14Fe\n3+\n + 8H2O = 2SO4\n2-\n + 15Fe\n2+\n + 16H\n+\n     8)\n \nand most likely mediated by bacteria (Bottrell and Tranter, 2002). However, there \nexists the possibility that inorganic oxidation mechanisms still operate under anoxic \nconditions, such as that depicted by Equation 9 (Schippers and J\u00f8rgensen, 2001): \nFeS2 + 7.5 MnO2 + 11 H\n+\n = Fe(OH)3 + 2 SO4\n2-\n + 7.5 Mn\n2+\n + 4 H2O  9) \nOther potential oxidants, such as NO3\n-\n appear to be kinetically unfavourable, at least \nin marine sediments (Schippers and J\u00f8rgensen, 2001). Whether Equation 8 is more \nfavourable than Equation 9 in glacial systems is untested, although most authors \ninvoke the former processes on the basis that the relevant microorganisms are now \nbeing detected using microbiological analysis (see Hodson et al, 2008 for a review).  \n \nMicrobial processes and the provision of non-snowpack N \nIf there are microbially-mediated rock-water interactions that produce *SO4\n2-\n, then it \nis reasonable to consider the impact of bacteria upon nitrogen export. Sustained, \n 24 \nnegative *NH4\n+\n concentrations most likely indicate microbial assimilation throughout \nthe summer, a process that has been described in Signy Island snowpacks by Hodson \n(2006). Hodson (2006) also described high *NO3\n-\n concentrations in late season runoff \nat both Site Q2 and Site Q1, and linked this to high rock-water contact environments \ndue to its covariance with dissolved Si. Wynn et al (2007) used stable isotopes to \nshow that bacteria most likely produce *NO3\n-\n in Arctic glacial till, and so a similar \nanalysis is reported below. Factors influencing the \n18\nO value of NO3\n-\n formed by \nbacterial nitrification have been recently discussed elsewhere (Mayer et al., 2001; \nKendall et al., 2007; Spoelstra et al., 2007). Under the simplest assumptions, \nautotrophic nitrification using two oxygen atoms from water and one from \natmospheric O2 would produce *NO3\n-\n with a \u03b418ONO3 value: \n\u03b418ONO3 = (0.33 \u00d7 \u03b4\n18\nOatmO2) + (0.66 \u00d7 \u03b4\n18\nOwater)     10) \nAs the average \u03b418Owater value of waters draining from moraine and talus samples was \n-11.9\u2030, and assuming \u03b418OatmO2 = +23.5\u2030, the theoretically expected \u03b4\n18\nONO3 value \nfor microbially produced NO3\n-\n for the present study is therefore -0.2\u2030. This value \nmay be compared to a \u03b418ONO3 range -2.1 to + 0.6\u2030 for samples from moraine and \ntalus waters (corrected \u03b418ONO3 Table 3) and +1.1 to +13.6 \u2030 at Q2, a range which is \njust greater than that observed at Q1. The low values in moraine and talus waters are \ntherefore strongly diagnostic of a microbial *NO3\n-\n source, as are the first samples \nfrom Q2 and Q1, which show that microbial *NO3\n-\n production was most important \nnear the ice margin just prior to the onset of the high flow phase (i.e. Q2 values are \nlower than Q1 values at first: Table 3). The Tuva Glacier basin is therefore similar to \nthe Alpine catchment described by Campbell et al (2002), where microbial production \nin talus deposits is also implicated as a source of *NO3\n-\n for runoff, and where *NO3\n-\n \ncan also dominate total NO3\n-\n during the runoff season.  \n 25 \nHowever, Figure 7 suggests that the above model of *NO3\n-\n production is problematic. \nIt shows the relationship between the *NO3\n-\n\/total NO3\n-\n and \u03b418ONO3 for samples at \nSites Q1, Q1, T1, T2 and M1. The negative association is significant at p = 0.0015 \nand appears to indicate a link between the importance of *NO3\n-\n production (up to 85% \nof total NO3\n-\n) and low \u03b418ONO3 values in runoff. However, the degree of scatter in the \nrelationship is not ideal (r\n2\n = 0.69), and the inferred \u03b418ONO3 composition for 100% \nsnowpack NO3\n-\n (ie the intercept of the regression line and the x axis) is ca. +13 \u2030, \nwhilst the inferred \u03b418ONO3 for *NO3\n-\n is far lower than -0.2\u2030 (about \u2013 8.9 \u2030 \naccording to the linear regression on the graph). Both end members are therefore \nsignificantly different to those expected according from our snow samples in Table 3 \n(\n18\nONO3 ca. 55\u2030) and the theoretical microbial end member for *NO3\n-\n (-0.2 \u2030). \nEither the theoretical constraints used here are unreliable, or a major source\/sink of \nNO3\n-\n has not been identified. Further studies should therefore be undertaken, ideally \nwith a contaminant-free method for the determination of snowpack \n18\nONO3. \nA means of further investigating the biogeochemistry of nitrogen in the Tuva Glacier \nbasin would be to consider the \n15\nNNO3 data in Table 3. However, it is likely that the \nmain potential sources are not readily distinguishable. The range of values for the \nsnowpack (-4.6 to +2.1\u2030) and the drainage waters (-2.1 to +0.4\u2030) are very similar to \none another, and correspond to the \n15\nN values expected for both NO3\n- \nin atmospheric \ndeposition, or *NO3\n- \nfrom mineralisation of organic N in pioneer environments (e.g. \nCampbell et al, 2002; Tye and Heaton, 2007; Wynn et al, 2007). A similar problem is \napparent with the \n15\nNNH4 values in Table 3, which otherwise compare favourably to \nvalues for Arctic glacier snowpacks and meltwaters (Wynn et al, 2007) and other \nSigny Island samples reported by Bockhorst et al (2007). In the latter case, values of \n 26 \n15\nNNH4 in aerosol samples were + 4.4 +4.7\u2030, whilst the bulk \n15\nN of precipitation \nduring the summer was + 6.4 + 1.1\u2030.  \n \nRock weathering yields \nLow yields of non-snowpack solutes are discernable in Table 1 (see also Hodson, \n2006). The preceding discussion suggests that this might be due to a combination of \nmodest rates of meltwater production and the absence of a high rock-water contact \nenvironment at the glacier bed. Further, there appear to be few reactive sulphide \nminerals surfaces to provide efficient proton sources for acid hydrolysis (Equation 5). \nTable 6 shows that the combined effect of these restrictions is to impose a system of \nlow rates of chemical denudation relative to the worldwide selection of glacial data. \nThus the present study produces a cationic denudation rate that is almost identical to \nthat reported for another polar, cold-based glacier basin (Scott Turnerbreen) by \nHodgkins et al (1997). These are some of the lowest cation yields reported in the \nliterature, being markedly lower than those reported for carbonate lithologies, or for \nglaciers with large runoff fluxes through crushed bedrock in subglacial environments \n(Anderson et al, 1997; Hodson et al, 2000; Tranter, 2005). Since both reactive \nlithologies (carbonates, shales and basalts) and large glaciers with subglacial \nweathering environments exist along the Antarctic Peninsula and its islands, it is clear \nthat more studies of glacial chemical weathering are required before the relationship \nbetween warming and the production of solute fluxes can be understood here. \n \nConclusions \n 27 \nRunoff during the melt season at Tuva Glacier Basin, Signy Island is very diagnostic \nsolute acquisition from crustal sources, despite there being a vast quantity of marine \u2013 \nderived solute mobilised from the snowpack. We have used stable isotope and \nchemical tracers of these interactions during this period of the melt season and found \nthat solute acquisition in talus and moraine sediments is particularly important, and \ncompensates for an absence of subglacial weathering beneath this small, cold-based \nglacier. The very earliest runoff conveys solute acquired from sub-oxic weathering \nenvironments in these sediments, which become oxygenated as the melt period \nprogresses. Evidence for NO3\n-\n and SO4\n2-\n production and high p(CO2) in longer \nresidence time meltwaters was particularly pronounced in this early phase of runoff, \nas was the assimilation of NH4\n+\n. Later on, these processes are increasingly important \nin the glacier forefield (see also Hodson, 2006). Many weathering signatures suggest \nthat a key role is played by microbial activity within these environments, which, along \nwith inorganic reactions, mean that the nutrients exported from the system are \nmarkedly different to those in the initial snowpack. However, low dissolved Fe \nconcentrations (< 10 \u00b5g L\n-1\n) result because reactive pyrite phases are limited and the \noxygenated bulk runoff stream has circum-neutral pH. Export of Fe to Fe-limited \nmarine ecosystems will therefore almost certainly be dominated by particulate FeIII \nphases.  \nWhile weathering environments at Tuva Glacier basin appear similar to subglacial \nweathering environments described elsewhere (e.g. Tranter et al, 2002), a majority of \nmeltwaters by-pass the reactive moraine and talus sediments. The overall efficacy of \nsolute export from crustal sources is therefore low, being ca. 163 *meq\n+\n km\n-2 \na\n-1 \nwhen expressed as a cation yield, which is dominated by Ca\n2+\n and Na\n+\n from calcite \nand feldspars repectively. When compared to a global range of 94 \u2013 4200 *meq+ km-\n 28 \n2 \na\n-1\n, the rates of solute production and the geochemical processes responsible for \nthem appear similar to colder Arctic glaciers.  \n \n \n 29 \nFigure captions \nFigure 1.
