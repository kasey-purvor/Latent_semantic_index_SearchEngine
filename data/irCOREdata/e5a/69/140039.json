The thin film ferroelectric \nmaterial is deposited on a fused silica growth substrate with a sacrificial release layer of ITO \n(indium tin oxide).  Regions of the film that are to be transferred are then selectively \nmetallised, and bonded to the target substrate.  Separation from the growth substrate is \nachieved by laser ablation of the ITO release layer by a single pulse from a KrF excimer laser, \nwith the laser light being incident through the growth substrate.  The residual ITO on the \ntransferred ferroelectric layer is electrically conducting, and may be suitable for incorporation \ninto the final device, depending on the application.  The new process has been demonstrated \nfor 500 nm-thick layers of sol-gel PZT which were thermosonically bonded to a silicon target \nsubstrate prior to laser release.  The transferred films show ferroelectric behaviour and have a \nslightly reduced permittivity compared to the as-deposited material.\n 2 \n1.  Introduction \nFerroelectric materials such as lead zirconate titanate (PZT) have potential applications in a \nwide range of miniaturised devices, including RF components (e.g. fixed capacitors, varactors \nand resonators), ferroelectric memories, and piezoelectric sensors and actuators [1-3].  \nHowever, the high processing temperatures required to produce dense and fully crystallised \nferroelectric layers can make integration of these materials into such devices challenging.  For \nexample, thin film processing methods typically involve annealing temperatures in the range \n500-700 \u00b0C.  This precludes fully monolithic fabrication on low-temperature (e.g. polymer) \nsubstrates which are of increasing interest in consumer electronics.  Even with traditional \nsubstrate materials such as silicon the design possibilities are reduced because the \nferroelectric film has to be deposited at an early stage before other materials are introduced.  \nThese compatibility issues are even more severe for thick films produced by tape-casting or \nscreen printing, where sintering temperatures in the range 800-1000 \u00b0C are typical. \n \nThe difficulties associated with fully monolithic integration can be avoided by forming the \nferroelectric film on a high-temperature growth substrate and then transferring it to a second \n\u201etarget\u201f substrate where the rest of the device fabrication will take place.  This kind of transfer \ncan be achieved by bonding the film to the target substrate and then removing the growth \nsubstrate by some combination of mechanical grinding and chemical etching [4].  However, \nthis approach is laborious and wasteful of growth substrate material.  Another possibility is to \nuse a growth substrate with a thin sacrificial layer, for example a metal oxide, which can be \nselectively etched away to release the film.  A third option, which avoids the use of any wet \nchemicals during release, is to use laser transfer processing (LTP), also referred to as laser \nlift-off (LLO).  Here the film is released from the growth substrate by a pulse of laser \nradiation incident through the substrate.  The laser wavelength is typically in the ultra-violet \n(UV), and is chosen such that the substrate is highly transmissive while the film to be \ntransferred is strongly absorbing.  The incident laser energy is absorbed in a thin layer of the \nfilm adjacent to the interface with the growth substrate, causing delamination to occur.  The \ndelamination process is generally attributed at least partly to ablative decomposition of the \nfilm, although in principle it could result purely from thermally induced shear stresses at the \ninterface.  \n \n 3 \nLaser transfer for ferroelectric films was first demonstrated by Tsakalakos et al. who applied \nit to lanthanum-modified PZT thin films produced by pulsed laser deposition on MgO \n(magnesium oxide) substrates [5,6].  The 1.4 m-thick films were first bonded to a stainless \nsteel foil target using palladium-indium bonding.  The same group have also demonstrated \nlaser transfer for thin films of unmodified PZT.  Other groups have applied laser transfer to \nthin and thick film PZT [7,8], and to various other ferroelectric materials in thin or thick film \nform, including barium strontium titanate, bismuth titanate, lanthanum-modified bismuth \ntitanate and bismuth ferrite-lead titanate [8,9].  In most of the work to date, silver-loaded \nepoxy resin has been used to bond the film to the target substrate prior to laser release. \n \nLaser transfer by direct absorption in the ferroelectric film provides an elegant, simple and \nfast method for release from the growth substrate.  However, this approach does have one \nsignificant drawback: it leaves a laser-damaged layer at the surface of the released film in \nwhich the ferroelectric properties are severely degraded.  This layer results from the transient \nheating induced by the laser pulse, and is typically of the order of 100 nm thick for films \nreleased by excimer laser.  The damaged layer can occupy a significant fraction of the total \nfilm thickness, in which case the ferroelectric and dielectric behaviour of the film as a whole \nwill be compromised.  Previous work has shown that the damage layer can be removed, and \nthe electrical properties recovered, by ion milling [5,6] or by polishing [8].  However, the first \nof these approaches is too slow to apply over large areas, while the second may not be \nsufficiently controllable for thin films. \n \nThis paper reports on a modified laser transfer process in which the laser energy is absorbed \nin a sacrificial release layer of indium tin oxide (ITO) that is deposited on the growth \nsubstrate prior to deposition of the ferroelectric film.  In this way, any laser damage during \nrelease occurs in the ITO layer which can subsequently be removed by wet or dry etching.  \nAlternatively, since ITO is electrically conducting, it may be appropriate to retain the ITO as a \ntop electrode in low-frequency applications where highly conductive electrodes are not \nessential.  Figure 1 shows an overview of the process, including both the film preparation and \nlaser transfer.  The process has been demonstrated for PZT films deposited on fused silica \nsubstrates by sol-gel processing and released using a KrF excimer laser (248 nm wavelength).  \nThermosonic bonding was used to attach the films to silicon substrates prior to laser release. \n \n 4 \nLaser transfer using release layers has been applied previously to micromachined components \nfabricated directly on silica wafers [10], and to components fabricated on silicon wafers and \ntransferred to glass carriers by bonding and substrate removal by grinding and etching \n[11,12].  It has also been used to release electronic components from glass carriers [13].  \nPolymer release layers have been used in all such processes to date.  Polymers are particularly \nattractive because they combine strong UV optical absorption with relatively poor thermal \nconductivity and low decomposition temperature, resulting in a low ablation threshold and \nhence a low fluence (energy per unit area) threshold for release.  Unfortunately, however, \npolymer materials cannot be used as release layers on growth substrates for ferroelectric \nfilms, because of the high processing temperatures involved.  Certain refractory metals could \nbe used, but the much higher thermal conductivity, coupled with the high ablation threshold, \nwould increase the likelihood of thermally-induced damage in the adjacent ferroelectric film.  \nThe high ablation threshold would also probably make the release process relatively violent \nand likely to produce mechanical damage.  ITO was chosen for the present work because it \ncombines a high melting point (ca 2000 K) with strong optical absorption and a low ablation \nthreshold in the UV.  The ablation properties of ITO and other transparent conductive oxides \nhave been studied extensively because of their potential applications in solar panels and \ndisplays.  The ablation threshold in an air ambient is around 100 mJ\/cm\n2\n at 248 nm \nwavelength [14] which is comparable to that of many polymer materials. \n \n2.  Experimental \nFilm preparation \nFigure 1a outlines the process used to produce thin PZT films for bonding and laser transfer.  \nThe growth substrates were prepared by depositing a 0.5 m-thick layer of ITO onto a 4\u201d-\ndiameter, 500 m-thick fused silica wafer.  The ITO was deposited by DC sputtering from a \npowdered ITO target (90\/10 composition) in an argon plasma containing 0.5% oxygen.  The \nresulting films were ~80% transmissive at 500nm wavelength and had a DC sheet resistance \nof ~100 \/\u25a1.   \n \nThe sol-gel PZT films were deposited using previously reported methods [15].  First, a seed \nlayer comprising 10 nm of titanium (Ti) for adhesion and 100 nm of platinum (Pt) was \ndeposited over the ITO.  Pt is commonly used as a bottom electrode for sol-gel PZT films \ndeposited on oxidised silicon because it promotes the formation of the desired perovskite \n 5 \nphase of the PZT.  The PZT film was built up by a sequence of spin-coating, pre-firing and \nannealing steps.  The thickness of each spin-coated layer was around 70 nm after annealing, \nand seven layers were deposited to produce a film with a nominal thickness of 0.5 m.  Each \nlayer was pre-fired at 200 \u00baC for 2 minutes for pyrolysis, and then annealed at 530 \u00baC for 5 \nminutes for crystallisation. \n \nFollowing the PZT deposition, regions of the PZT layer that were to be transferred were \nselectively metallised by photolithography and electroplating.  A sputtered chrome\/copper \nlayer (20 nm Cr followed by 60 nm Cu) was deposited to act as an electroplating seed layer.  \nA plating mould with square apertures of various sizes up to 800 \u00d7 800 m\n2 \nwas then formed \nin a 10 m-thick layer of AZ9260 photoresist, and nickel and gold were electroplated into the \napertures to depths of 5 m and 1 m respectively.  Finally the photoresist was stripped to \nleave a series of metallised islands or \u201cpads\u201d.  The metallisation served a dual role of \nproviding a bondable top surface for the PZT pads and increasing the mechanical robustness \nof the PZT layer during the release process.  In earlier laser release experiments it was found \nthat un-metallised thin films of PZT tend to fracture upon release from the growth substrate.  \n \nIn the final preparation step, the material surrounding each metallised PZT pad was removed \nby laser machining down through all the deposited layers (Cu\/Cr\/PZT\/Pt\/Ti\/ITO), stopping at \nthe silica substrate.  This was done using the KrF excimer laser in direct-write mode, with a \nlaser spot formed by projecting a mask aperture.  Chemical etching could equally well have \nbeen used here, but laser machining was chosen as it allowed all layers to be removed in a \nsingle operation.  A layer of photoresist was spun over the wafer prior to laser machining to \nprotect the gold-metallised areas from ablation debris.  This protective layer was later \nremoved, together with any residual ablation debris, using acetone. \n \nThermosonic bonding \nDirect gold-gold thermosonic (TS) bonding was used to attach the metallised PZT pads to \ntarget substrates prior to laser release (Figure 1b).  TS bonding is widely used in electronic \npackaging, both for wire-bonding and flip-chip attachment [16].  It has the advantages that it \ndoes not require any additional joining materials or fluxes, and the resulting assembly is free \nfrom organic materials that might degrade over time.  The electrical performance is also better \nthan that obtained by most other joining methods.  On the other hand, TS bonding is generally \n 6 \nlimited to device or die level because it is difficult to distribute the ultrasonic energy and \nbonding force with sufficient uniformity over large areas.  \n \nTS bonding was carried out using a custom bonder developed for thermosonic flip chip \nassembly [17].  Each PZT pad was bonded to the centre of a gold-metallised silicon die.  The \n3 \u00d7 3 mm\n2\n dies were fabricated by electroplating gold onto a silicon wafer and then dicing the \nwafer by deep reactive ion etching.  Bonding was carried out with the growth wafer mounted \non the heated platform of the TS bonder, and the silicon die held in the ultrasonic bond tool.  \nNominal values for the bonder parameters were: a platform temperature of 200 \u00baC, a bonding \nforce of 0.015 gf\/ m\n2\n, and an ultrasonic power of 20 W applied for 500 msec. \n \nLaser release \nLaser release experiments were carried out using an Exitech laser workstation equipped with \nan LPX 220i excimer laser (248 nm wavelength, 30 ns pulse duration).  The system includes a \nbeam homogeniser and an in-line attenuator ensuring uniform illumination and a well-defined \nfluence at the sample.  The illuminated area at the sample plane was defined by projecting a \nmask aperture of known size using a 4X reduction lens.  Fluence measurements were made by \nmeasuring the total pulse energy beyond the focal plane, and dividing by the illuminated area. \n \nFor release experiments, the growth wafer was suspended upside down over a receiving \nsubstrate with a small gap between the two.  The laser beam was incident from above so that \nthe released die, with attached PZT film, fell onto the receiving substrate.  \n \nAnalysis \nThe structure of the as-deposited PZT films was analysed by XRD, using a Siemens D5005 \nX-ray diffractometer configured for CuK  radiation.  Electrical characterisation was also \ncarried out, both on as-deposited films and on transferred films.  This included small-signal \nAC capacitance and loss measurements, made using a Wayne-Kerr 6425 Precision \nComponent Analyser, and PE loop measurements made using a Radiant Technologies RT66a \nFerroelectric Test System.  Cr\/Au dots were sputtered onto the as-deposited films to form top \nelectrodes, with the underlying Ti\/Pt layer being used as a bottom electrode.  The transferred \nfilms were tested using the residual ITO (with underlying Ti\/Pt) as the top electrode, with \nconnection to the underside being made via the gold surface on the target die. \n 7 \n \n3.  Results and Discussion  \nA key requirement for any process of the type reported here is that it must be possible to form \nproperly crystallised ferroelectric films on the release layer.  Figure 2 shows a typical XRD \nmeasurement for a PZT film deposited on Pt\/Ti\/ITO\/silica.  The peaks attributed to PZT are \nall for the perovskite phase, confirming that crystallisation has been achieved.  However, \nmany different perovskite orientations are represented, indicating that the film is not \npredominantly (111)-oriented as can be obtained for films deposited on a Pt\/Ti\/SiO2\/silicon \nsubstrate.  A likely explanation for this is that the surface roughness of the sputtered ITO is \ndisrupting the orientation of the Pt layer and hence preventing proper alignment of the PZT.  \nIf so it may be possible achieve lower surface roughness, and more highly oriented PZT, by \nannealing the sputtered ITO films in oxygen, or by using ITO films grown by PLD (pulsed \nlaser deposition). \n \nThe XRD plot also shows several peaks for ITO, one of which (at 2  = 30\u00ba) coincides with \nthe position of the unwanted pyrochlore phase of PZT.  Consequently it is not possible to \nconclude from the XRD plot alone that full crystallisation into the perovskite phase has taken \nplace.  However, capacitance measurements on the as-deposited films yielded dielectric \nconstants in the range 370-450 at low frequency (1 kHz), which is consistent with full \ncrystallisation; much lower values would be expected for films containing pyrochlore. \n \nRelease experiments were carried out over a wide range of fluences, from 375 mJ\/cm\n2\n up to \n1125 mJ\/cm\n2\n.  At lower fluence levels, typically up to around 450 mJ\/cm\n2\n, a single pulse did \nnot lead to any release.  Above this level there was a narrow intermediate fluence range where \na single pulse tended to produce only partial release, and if further pulses were applied the \nfilm would release fully but with some damage.  At fluence levels above about 500 mJ\/cm\n2\n \nrelease was consistently achieved with a single laser pulse.  This value is near the middle of \nthe range of fluences used previously for excimer laser transfer of ferroelectric films by direct \nabsorption.  For example, refs [5-9] report fluences over the range 250 to 700 mJ\/cm\n2\n. The \nfluence levels required for excimer laser transfer with organic release layers are typically \nsomewhat lower, in the range 100 to 300 mJ\/cm\n2\n (see e.g. [10]). \n \n \n 8 \nFigure 3 shows an optical micrograph of a 600 \u00d7 600 m\n2\n pad released with a fluence of 525 \nmJ\/cm\n2\n.  Some discoloration of the release layer has occurred, which is typical for excimer \nlaser exposure of ITO [14].  A small area of the ITO has also been lost at the release step, \nexposing the underlying Ti\/Pt.  This is an artefact of the way the material was removed from \naround the pads; some clearance was left between the laser spot and the edge of the pad, \nresulting in a fillet of unsupported material that tends to fracture during laser release.  This \nproblem, and the generally poor edge quality of the pad, could be improved by refining the \nlaser machining process or replacing it by chemical etching.  Finally, several probe marks left \nbehind by electrical testing can be seen near the centre of the pad.   \n \nFigure 4 shows a comparison between measured PE loops for as-deposited and laser \ntransferred films.  Both films exhibit shifts along the field axis but in opposite directions: +25 \nkV\/cm and -85 kV\/cm respectively.  Such asymmetric switching indicates the presence of an \ninternal electric field and this also accounts for the observed preference for a particular \npolarisation direction, evidenced by the difference in the positive and negative remanent \npolarisations (Pr+ and Pr-).  Although electric fields can exist in the bulk of films, in our case \nit is most likely that the operative ones are located at the electrode-PZT interfaces and that the \nshift is linked to the use of different materials for the top and bottom electrodes [18].  The \nrelatively large shift in the case of the laser transferred film is believed to be due to some \nartefact of processing, such as the sputter cleaning process prior to deposition of the \nelectroplating seed layer, which was not used for the \u201eas deposited\u201f measurements.  The \ncoercive field after removal of the field axis shift is (Ec+  Ec-)\/2 = 115 kV\/cm which is \nslightly lower than the value of 127 kV\/cm reported previously for PZT films formed on Si \nsubstrates by a similar sol-gel process [15].  In contrast, thin PZT films formed on sapphire \nsubstrates by higher temperature sol-gel processing, and transferred by direct absorption in the \nPZT, showed a significant increase in coercive field (from 50 kV\/cm to 150 kV\/cm) due to the \nformation of a low-permittivity damage layer [8,9]. \n \nThe remanent polarisation values for the transferred film are Pr+ = 32 C\/cm\n2\n and Pr- = -17 \nC\/cm , compared to Pr+ = 9 C\/cm\n2\n and Pr- = -12 C\/cm\n2 \nfor the as-deposited film.  The \nremanent polarisation values in the pre- transferred film are significantly lower than the value \nof Pr = 24 C\/cm\n2\n reported in [15] for films formed on Si, probably because of the larger \nthermal mismatch between PZT and glass compared to that of  PZT and Si and consequently \n 9 \nlarger tensile stress [19].  Furthermore the higher, close to normal, values observed for the \ntransferred film are believed to be the result of stress relaxation in the film following release \nfrom the growth substrate.  For comparison, values of Pr = 24 C\/cm\n2\n and Pr 30 C\/cm\n2\n \nwere reported in [8] and [9] respectively for sol-gel PZT films transferred from sapphire \nsubstrates without a release layer. \n \nFigure 5 shows dielectric constant and loss tangent measurements for the same transferred \nfilm.  The dielectric constant, which varies from 319 at 1 kHz to 309 at 300 kHz, is reduced \ncompared to that of the as-deposited film, though not significantly.  The film shows low loss \n(0.005) at 1 kHz, but the loss increases to 0.09 at 300 kHz.  It is believed that the increase \nmay be due to the series resistance of a laser-damaged layer at the top surface of the ITO, but \nthis aspect requires further investigation.  \n \n4.  Conclusion \nA new laser transfer process for ferroelectric thin films has been demonstrated in which the \nlaser energy is absorbed in an ITO release layer, thereby avoiding laser damage to the \ntransferred film.  To our knowledge this is the first report of thin film laser transfer directly \nfrom a high-temperature growth substrate using a release layer.  The residual ITO on the \ntransferred film can be removed by selective etching, although for some applications it may \nbe appropriate to retain the ITO as a top electrode.  The initial results presented here indicate \nthat the process does not result in any significant degradation of the ferroelectric properties, \nalthough further analysis is required to establish conclusively the reasons for the changes that \nare observed, in particular the offsetting of the PE loop in the transferred material.  The new \nprocess has been demonstrated only for sol-gel PZT films deposited on fused silica substrates, \nwith thermosonic bonding to silicon target substrates.  However, it has the potential to be \ncombined with other film fabrication methods, bonding techniques, and growth\/target \nsubstrate materials. \n \nAcknowledgement \nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the UK Engineering and Physical \nSciences Research Council under the Flagship Project EP\/D064805\/1, \u201cIntegrated functional \nmaterials for system-in-package applications\u201d. \n 10 \nReferences \n1.
