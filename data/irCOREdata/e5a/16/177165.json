However, most of these analyses are based on a \ncomparison of healthcare policies and, as such, only tell part of a complex and evolving story.  \nThis paper considers official responses to a shared public health policy aim, the reduction of \nhealth inequalities, through an examination of national policy statements produced in England, \nScotland and Wales respectively since 1997. The analysis suggests that the relatively \nconsistent manner in which the \u2018policy problem\u2019 of health inequalities has been framed \ncombined with the dominance of a medical model of health have constrained policy responses.  \nOur findings differ from existing analyses, raising some important questions about the actuality \nof, and scope for, policy divergence since devolution. \n \nKey words: Health inequalities; devolution; policy divergence; critical discourse analysis; \nBritain. \n \nIntroduction: \n 2 \nAlthough the political devolution of power to a Scottish Executivei and a Welsh Assembly \nGovernment in 1999 was limited, it was still welcomed by many as a process which opened up \n\u2018the potential for the development of radically different social policies\u2019 (Mooney et al, 2006: \n483)ii, iii\n \n. Indeed, commenting on the discussions which led up to devolution in Scotland, Parry \n(1997: 34) claims that \u2018The ability to take distinctive action on social policy has been one of the \nmain justifications for a Scottish Assembly or Parliament.\u2019  Similarly for Wales, Mooney and \nWilliams (2006: 610) claim it was the \u2018potential of [devolved] social policymaking to produce a \nmore socially cohesive society\u2019 which persuaded the electorate to vote in favour (albeit \nnarrowly) of a Welsh Assembly.  Furthermore, a perception that both Wales and Scotland faced \ndistinct social problems which required context-specific responses formed a significant part of \nthe rationale for political devolution (see, for example, Dewar, 1999; National Assembly for \nWales, 2001).  However, the extent to which Wales and Scotland have developed into the \n\u2018policy laboratories\u2019 some expected (e.g. ESRC Devolution & Constitutional Change \nProgramme, 2003) remains the subject of much debate (Mooney & Scott, 2005; Silburn, 2004; \nStewart, 2004). \nThe dominance, until recently, of one political party (Labour) in all three politiesiv\n \n, the restricted \nnature of devolution arrangements (e.g. Cairney, 2004; Mooney et al., 2006), processes of \n\u2018path dependency\u2019 or historical institutionalism (see Fawcett, 2003) and a global, \u2018neoliberal \nonslaught\u2019 (Mooney et al., 2006) have all been cited as factors which have operated to \nconstrain the possibility of significant policy divergence.  However, health policy, one of the \nmost significant policy areas in which the devolved governments have been granted extensive \nresponsibilities, is one area in which there appears to be some consensus that important policy \ndistinctions have emerged.  For example, some of the most widely reported policy divergences \nto date relate to health, such as the Scottish Executive\u2019s prominent early decisions to provide \nfree personal care for the elderly and to ban smoking in public places and, and the Welsh \nAssembly Government\u2019s decision to phase out prescription charges.  Indeed, Scott Greer\u2019s \nanalyses (2001, 2003, 2004, 2005) appear to dominate a current consensus that policymakers \nconcerned with health issues in the devolved governments have responded to \u2018their particular \nproblems and debates in ways that vary territorially and produce territorial policy divergence \nthat matters\u2019 (Greer, 2005: 501). \nPut simply, Greer\u2019s claim is that whilst English health policies have focused on the introduction \nof markets to the NHS, Scottish health policies have concentrated on strengthening the role of \n 3 \nmedical professionals, and Welsh health policies have emphasised the importance of localism.  \nThis thesis is widely, and often uncritically, cited (e.g. Cairney, 2006, 2007; Chaney & \nDrakeford, 2004; Keating, 2005; Poole & Mooney, 2005) and has led to claims that we are now \nexperiencing a natural policy experiment in the health arena (e.g. Smith & Babbington, 2006).  \nAmid such enthusiastic claims, there has been only limited acknowledgement that some not \ninsignificant differences between the three countries existed long before political devolution \n(see, for example, the pre-devolution analysis of diversity in the field of community care by \nHunter & Wistow, 1987).  Perhaps more remarkably, there has been little reflection on the way \nin which analyses purporting to consider divergences in \u2018health policy\u2019 focus almost entirely on \nhealthcare policies.  For example, only one of Greer\u2019s analyses specifically considers how each \ngovernment has approached public health policy issues and, as this was published only two \nyears after devolution, the findings provide only a snapshot of post-devolution policies in their \ninfancy (Greer, 2001).  Furthermore, although Greer (2001) finds some similarities between \napproaches to public health in Scotland and England, he does not suggest that public health \npolicy is any less divergent than healthcare policy, and seems to include this part of the \nanalysis in his general conclusion that \u2018distinct logics\u2019 are governing each polity\u2019s approach to \n\u2018health policy\u2019. \n \nThis gap in the literature is particularly surprising when public health has formed a key concern \nof all three governments.  Indeed, as has been widely reported, the election of a Labour \ngovernment in 1997 marked a key moment for many in the public health community as it \nrepresented the first time in 18 years that a government had made an explicit commitment to \nreducing health inequalities (see Berridge & Blume, 2003).  Since then, the issue has been \nconsistently highlighted as a policy priority in all three mainland British countries (e.g. \nDepartment of Health, 2000; Health Improvement Strategy Division, 2002; Public Health \nStrategy Division, 2002).  Health inequalities are a particularly interesting social issue to \nexplore from the perspective of devolution as they represent a cross-cutting and complex \nproblem to which solutions remain unclear and contested.  In other words, health inequalities \nconstitute a \u2018wicked issue\u2019 of the sort one might expect different policymaking contexts to \napproach experimentally (Blackman et al., 2006). \n \nThis paper attempts to redress the service-orientated bias of current analyses of the impact of \ndevolution on \u2018health policies\u2019 by focusing specifically on policy responses to health \ninequalities.  By this term we mean the preventable variations in individuals\u2019 health status which \n 4 \nare associated with differences in their social (or geographical) positionv\n \n.  In exploring the ways \nin which policy statements from each country frame and discuss this issue, the findings \npresented in this paper contrast significantly with most existing analyses of post-devolution \nhealth policy, revealing a surprising degree of convergence across the three countries as well \nas some continuity with the past (Parry, 2003).  It is argued that the similar ways in which \nhealth inequalities have been conceptualised and framed as a policy problem in the three \npolicy contexts, combined with the dominance of a medical model of health, are likely to have \nplayed an important role in constraining policy responses.  This paper forms part of a larger \nESRC-funded project looking at the impact of varying performance assessment arrangements \non making progress with tackling health inequalities across Britain (see Blackman et al., 2006). \nMethodology: \nWritten texts form an important part of social worlds in all literate societies and are often under-\nanalysed compared to research that focuses on interactions with people (Atkinson & Coffey, \n2004).  Public policy statements are a distinctive kind of text which frame the nature of public \npolicy problems, shape the boundaries of possible responses and act as points of reference for \na wide variety of actors to justify subsequent actions (see Freeman, 2006).  As a result of their \nauthorship, policy documents are able to impose a particular kind of power through the words \nthey use.  What seems to be presented as fact within policy statements, often represents policy \ndecisions (or non-decisions) which, in turn, may be based on implicit assumptions \n(Iannantuono & Eyles, 1997: 1620).  Analysing these texts in order to uncover what these \nassumptions are and how they are likely to shape the way in which other actors conceive of \nand respond to particular policy problems therefore provides a key method of understanding \npolicy processes. Unsurprisingly, then, Hanney and colleagues (Hanney et al, 2003) conclude \nthat the analysis of policy documents is a crucial method of understanding policy responses to \nhealth problems. \n \nThis \u2018linguistic turn\u2019 within social sciences has stimulated a wide range of approaches to \nexploring language and several alternative approaches to analysing the policy texts were \ninitially piloted on some of the key documents included in the analysis.  The eventual approach \nchosen combined elements of Critical Discourse Analysis techniques, pioneered by academics \nsuch as Fairclough (2000), with a focus on exploring how health inequalities have been \nconstructed as a \u2018policy problem\u2019 (see Gamble & Stone, 2006).  On this basis, a framework of \nkey questions was compiled to aid the analysis of each document.  This framework focuses on \n 5 \nthree sets of questions: (i) the first explore how health inequalities are constructed as a \u2018policy \nproblem\u2019; (ii) the second focus on how the texts present the causes of, and solutions to, health \ninequalities and the assumptions which underlie these claims; (iii) and the third aims to uncover \nwhere responsibility for taking action to tackle health inequalities (and achieve results) lies and \non what assumptions these allocations are made.  Both the framework for analysis and the \ninclusion criteria for policy statements were approved by the authors of this paper who, \nbetween them, have a range of disciplinary backgrounds and are dispersed across England, \nScotland and Wales. \n \nGiven that health inequalities only moved back onto the official policy agenda in 1997, with the \narrival of a Labour government, this year was taken as the starting point for the analysis and \nMay 2007 was chosen as the end point on the basis that it was in this month that new \ngovernments were formed in Wales and Scotland and, shortly afterwards, that a new Prime \nMinister took office in England.  It is important to state at the outset that as this paper is based \nsolely on the discourse analysis of national policy statements and it does not aim to capture the \nviews of local or national actors, which may well tell a different story.  Nor can it explore how \nthe differing structures of the NHS and local government in each country impact on the way in \nwhich policies are implemented.  However, both these issues are being explored in the broader \nESRC project (Blackman et al., 2006). \n \nOwing to the volume of official publications relating to health inequalities in each country \n(especially in England), it was necessary to establish clear inclusion criteria for the study.  It \nwas decided to include only national policy statements of significant relevance to health \ninequalities, notably White Papers and national guidance on how other \norganisations\/individuals should tackle health inequalities.  It did not include advisory \ndocuments, such as the Acheson (1998), Wanless (2002, 2003, 2004), Beecham (2006), or \nKerr (2005) reports.  Nor, for England and Scotland, did it include consultative documents.  \nThis decision was made on the basis that where aspects of consultative or advisory documents \nhad been taken up by policymakers, they should be visible in subsequent policy statements.  \nThe inclusion criteria had to be adjusted somewhat for Wales in light of the fact that Wales has \nnot had primary legislative making powers.  As a result, key consultative documents were \nincluded for Wales, especially those, such as Well Being in Wales, which are referred to in later \ndocuments as having set the national agenda (Public Health Strategy Division, 2002).  Based \non these criteria, 75 statements were included in the analysis (33 from England, 24 from \n 6 \nScotland, and 18 from Wales).  Given the extent of the data arising from this analysis, this \npaper does not attempt to provide a detailed account of the selected policy statements but \nrather summarises aspects of the overall findings which, firstly, illustrate the extent of policy \nsimilarities with regards to the issue of health inequalities and, secondly, provide insights into \nthe reasons underlying this convergence. \n \nHealth inequalities in post-1997 English, Scottish and Welsh health policy statements \n(i) The construction of health inequalities as a \u2018policy problem\u2019 \nThe policy statements from all three countries employ the term \u2018health inequalities\u2019 to refer to a \nvariety of forms of health stratification, including health differences between men and women \nand between ethnic groups.  However, although there are some minor but noticeable \ndifferences between the emphases of each country in this respectvi, policy conceptualisations \ngenerally echo the UK research literature by most frequently focusing on health differences \nbetween social classes and geographical areasvii\n \n. \nMoving beyond types of health inequality, the issue can be further conceptualised in the \nfollowing three ways (see Graham and Kelly, 2004): (i) as a problem of \u2018health disadvantage\u2019, \nresulting from the poor health of poor people (or people in poor areas); (ii) as a \u2018health gap\u2019, in \nwhich the issue requiring attention is the health difference between poor groups and others \n(\u2018others\u2019 possibly representing the wealthiest groups or, perhaps, the national average); or (iii) \nas a \u2018social gradient in health\u2019, involving a health slope which cuts across the whole of society.  \nThese three conceptualisations are not entirely incompatible.  However, as Graham and Kelly \ndemonstrate (2004), the way in which the problem of health inequalities is conceived within \npolicy has important consequences for the kinds of solutions which consequently appear most \nlogical.  A crucial difference is that the first and second conceptualisations locate the \u2018problem\u2019 \nof health inequalities largely at the poorer end of the spectrum (i.e. with lower social classes or \nwith people living in deprived areas).  Such conceptualisations are therefore likely to encourage \npolicy interventions which are targeted specifically at these groups.  Notions of social gradients \nin health, on the other hand, challenge the logic of focusing only on people at one end of a \nspectrum by framing the problem as one which cuts across the whole of society and therefore \nrequires a societal (and not just a targeted) response. A societal response would need to \naddress the full range of inequality in incomes and wealth, and their manifestation as a health \ngradient, rather than the position of the poorest (either in absolute or relative terms). \n \n 7 \nSimilarly to Graham and Kelly\u2019s (2004) analysis of the English policy, the analysis on which this \npaper is based found rather more evidence of the first two conceptualisations of health \ninequalities than of a \u2018social gradient in health\u2019.  Table 1 provides some illustrative extracts from \npolicy statements of each country which demonstrate the way in which health inequalities have \nbeen described as an issue of \u2018health disadvantage\u2019 and \u2018health gaps\u2019.  There are no examples \nof references to social gradients in health because none were found in either the Welsh or \nScottish policy statements and, although a few references to social gradients in health were \nfound in some English policy statements (e.g. Department of Health, 2003 and Health \nInequalities Unit, 2005), these remained far outnumbered by discussions focusing on \u2018health \ngaps\u2019 and \u2018health disadvantage\u2019. \n \nTABLE 1 TO BE INSERTED HERE \n \nThe key point about the way in which health inequalities has been conceptualised as a policy \nproblem in each country is that, even where \u2018health gaps\u2019 are referred to, the focus remains on \nthe need to improve the poor health of poor people.  This conceptualisation is evident in the \ntargets (or, in the case of Wales, aspirations) which were eventually set out in relation to health \ninequalities in each country. \n \nIn 2001, England became the first of the three countries to introduce specific, national targets \nfor reducing health inequalities.  Initially there were two separate targets focusing on a \nreduction in the infant mortality \u2018gap\u2019 between manual groups and the rest of the population and \na reduction in the \u2018gap\u2019 between the fifth of areas with the lowest life expectancy at birth and \nthe population as a whole, both of which were to be achieved by 2010 (see Department of \nHealth, 2001a, 2001b).  However, following several amendmentsviii\n \n, these targets were \ncombined into a single Public Service Agreement focusing on area-based differences (HM \nTreasury, 2004).   The way in which these targets have been constructed underlines the \nconceptualisation of health inequalities as an area-based \u2018health gap\u2019.  The national policy \nfocus, therefore, has been on improving the health outcomes of these areas (such as the \nSpearhead areas) at a faster rate than the national average. \nAlthough the Scottish Executive had not officially introduced any national health inequality \ntargets when the English ones were announced, the performance assessment framework for \nthe NHS introduced in Scotland in 2001 did include a commitment to tracking indicators of \n 8 \ninequality.  This form of monitoring health inequalities relied on a conceptualisation of the issue \nas a \u2018health gap\u2019 but, in contrast to England (which focused on the differences between the \nmost deprived areas and the national average), the gap to be measured was the more \nambitious one of that between the most deprived and the most affluent areas.  Following a \nreport from an expert group (Measuring Inequalities in Health Working Group, 2003), Scotland \nlater introduced national targets for reducing health inequalities.  However, despite a previous \ncommitment to setting targets around the narrowing of a \u2018health gap\u2019 (Scottish Executive Health \nDepartment, 2003), the targets that were eventually introduced were, in fact, health \nimprovement targets with a specific focus on the most deprived areas of Scotland (Scottish \nExecutive, 2004).  Until 2006 \u2018health gaps\u2019 continued to be monitored as part of the \nperformance assessment framework but the recent introduction of a new performance \nmanagement system, referred to as HEAT (Health, Efficiency, Access and Treatment targets), \nhas effectively removed any commitment to measuring \u2018health gaps\u2019 in Scotland and reinforced \na conceptualisation of health inequalities as a problem of \u2018health disadvantage\u2019. \n \nMuch of the language in the statements that were analysed suggests Welsh policymakers \nhave, to date, been less concerned with targets than their colleagues in England and Scotland.  \nHowever, Wales also decided to establish an expert group to advise on measuring health \ninequalities (Expert Group on Indicators of Health Inequality, 2001).  This group recommended \nthat \u2018health gaps\u2019 between areas should be officially monitored (a recommendation that has not \nyet been followed up) but advised against setting specific targets for reducing health \ninequalities on the basis that it would allow the government to take a longer-term (but more \neffective) approach to the issue by focusing on wider, social determinants.  Between 2003 and \n2004, several new \u2018health gain\u2019 (health improvement) targets were announced and these \ninclude what are referred to as \u2018health inequalities targets\u2019.  However, these \u2018targets\u2019 are \nessentially statements of aspiration.  The Welsh Assembly Government has, therefore, \ncontinued to avoid specific, quantified targets for health inequalities (against which the success \nor failure of its policies in this area might be measured). \n \nThe contrasting decisions that each government made about health inequalities targets to \nsome extent support Greer\u2019s (2001) claims that different \u2018logics\u2019 are governing each country\u2019s \napproach to health policy.  The fact that England was the first to set specific national health \ninequality targets may reflect its much-discussed \u2018target-culture\u2019 (see Blackman et al., 2006).  \nWhilst the decision in Wales initially not to set targets for health inequalities, and even its more \n 9 \nrecent decision to outline only aspirational \u2018targets\u2019, suggests there is notably less of a belief \namongst Welsh policymakers that quantifiable targets are an effective way of promoting \ndesirable change.  Scotland\u2019s decision to outline health inequality targets suggests the logic at \nwork here may not be so different from that in England (even if, as discussed, the Scottish \ntargets are not dependent on the reduction of a \u2018health gap\u2019).  From this perspective, it is the \nWelsh Assembly Government that has most noticeably diverged from the other two countries, \nsupporting Greer\u2019s (2003) and Chaney and Drakeford\u2019s (2004) claims that, despite more limited \npolicymaking powers, the approach to health policy has been more long-term and, perhaps, \nmore radical in Wales.  However, whether the contrasting approaches taken to targets mean \nthat the broader approach to health inequalities also differs, and whether the lack of specific \ntargets has enabled Wales to take a longer-term strategy, remains questionable, as the next \nsections discuss.   Crucially, in all three countries, health inequalities have consistently been \nconceptualised as a policy problem relating to the poor health of poor people (or people in poor \nareas). \n \n(ii) How the policies portray the causes of, and solutions to, health inequalities \nIn explaining the existence of health inequalities, the initial policy statements of each country \nplace a significant amount of emphasis on wider determinants of health such as social \nexclusion, poor housing and inequalities in educational and employment opportunities, as well \nas on differential patterns of lifestyle behaviour: \n \nFrom Vision to Reality (Department of Health, 2001a): \u2018The worst health problems in \nthe country will not be tackled without dealing with their fundamental causes \u2013 poverty, \nlack of education, poor housing, unemployment, discrimination and social exclusion.\u2019 \n \nOur National Health (Scottish Executive, 2000): \u2018Poverty, poor housing, homelessness \nand the lack of educational and economic opportunity are the root causes of major \ninequalities in health in Scotland. We must fight the causes of illness as well as illness \nitself.\u2019 \n \nWell Being in Wales (Public Health Strategy Division, 2002): \u2018The mix of social, \neconomic, environmental and cultural factors that affect individuals\u2019 lives determines \ntheir health and well being. We can only improve well being in the long term by \naddressing these factors.\u2019 \n 10 \n \nThe above three quotations are illustrative of the emphasis placed on broader determinants of \nhealth in the policy statements from each country published prior to 2003.  However, despite \nsuch rhetorical commitments to tackling \u2018wider determinants\u2019, explanations as to how such \ndeterminants are to be tackled are limited, often consisting of no more than referencing existing \nor forthcoming initiatives from non-health departments (with little indication that the initiatives \nwere designed to reduce health inequalities).  The best example of this is in the Scottish White \nPaper, Towards a Healthier Scotland (Secretary of State for Scotland, 1999), which provides a \ntable outlining the \u2018three-level\u2019 approach to tackling health inequalities, incorporating \u2018life \ncircumstances\u2019, \u2018lifestyles\u2019 and \u2018health topics\u2019.  However, as Table 2 illustrates, whilst specific \nfoci for action are provided in the columns for the latter two foci, the column for \u2018life \ncircumstances\u2019 is left completely empty. \n \nTABLE 2 TO BE INSERTED HERE \n \nIn explaining the empty first column, the document says that \u2018expert groups' are investigating \nhow to set targets relating to life circumstances and that the consultation process is ongoing. \nThis may reflect a genuine desire to ensure that appropriate foci are chosen, although it is \nunclear why the factors listed as a footnote to the table could not have been included in the first \ncolumn.  Overall, it cannot be ignored that, whilst frequent references are made to tackling the \n\u2018wider determinants\u2019 of health inequalities throughout many of the policy statements, few \nattempts are made to specify how this will be achieved. \n \nAdditionally, it is noticeable that in all three contexts the emphasis placed on policy \ninterventions designed to tackle the wider determinants of health (at least those mentioned \nwithin health policies) has lessened over time.  This shift is accompanied by a noticeable \nincrease in the emphasis placed on the role of lifestyle behaviours (especially smoking) in \nexplaining and responding to health inequalities.  Within Scottish and English statements, this \nchange is reflected in a shift in the focus of phrases such as \u2018determinants of health and health \ninequalities\u2019.  Prior to 2003, these types of phrase are frequently employed to describe social \nand economic determinants, such as poverty and deprivation, as well as various lifestyle \nbehaviours, such as smoking and diet.  However, in the documents published from 2003 \nonwards, such phrases increasingly emphasise the latter rather than the former.  For example, \nDelivering Choosing Health (Department of Health, 2005) specifically states that one of its key \n 11 \nobjectives is to: \u2018Tackle the underlying determinants of ill health and health inequalities\u2019 [our \nemphasis], a phrase which is often employed in the academic literature to refer to the social \nand economic contexts within which people are situated.  However, the way in which the \ndocument claims this objective will be achieved relates solely to tackling three lifestyle-\nbehavioural issues (reducing adult smoking, childhood obesity and under-18 conception rates).   \nIn other words, as Graham and Kelly (2004) point out, all-encompassing phrases such as \n\u2018wider (or underlying) determinants of health\u2019 can facilitate confusion between the policy aim of \ntackling the determinants of health inequalities and that of merely improving determinants of \nhealth.  This is important because improving the latter could, potentially, lead to widening \nhealth inequalities (as seems to have been the case within the UK over the past twenty years). \n \nThe way in which health inequalities have been conceptualised as a policy problem relating to \nthe poor health of poor people may well underlie this confusion as it appears to have resulted in \nan assumption (evident across statements from all three countries) that policy interventions \ndesigned to improve health will, if targeted correctly, reduce health inequalities.  This \nassumption is apparent in the following quotations: \n \nChoosing Health (Secretary of State for Health, 2004): \u2018In order to close the gap, we \nmust ensure that the most marginalised and excluded groups and areas in society see \nfaster improvements in health.\u2019 \n \nThe Challenge (Scottish Executive Health Department, 2003): \u2018[The challenge is] to \nnarrow the opportunity gap and improve the health of our most disadvantaged \ncommunities at a faster rate, thereby narrowing the health gap.\u2019 \n \nImproving Health in Wales (Health Service Strategy Team (WAG), 2001): \u2018Imagination \nand courage are needed to tackle and overcome the health and social inequalities that \nare related to each other.  [\u2026] We are committed to providing additional funding that is \ntargeted at groups with the greatest health and social need\u2026\u2019 \n \nEach of the above quotations implies that a policy focus on improving the health of poorer \ngroups will necessarily reduce health inequalities.  Further evidence of the apparent policy \nbelief that approaches designed to improve population health can also be employed to help \nreduce health inequalities is provided in claims that targets for health improvement (reducing \n 12 \nrates of major chronic diseases and\/or rates of contributory lifestyle behaviours), which have \nbeen set in all three countries (Secretary of State for Health, 1998; Secretary of State for \nScotland, 1999; The Welsh Office, 1997), were expected to contribute to the aim of reducing \nhealth inequalities. \n \nIn Wales, whilst there is less evidence of a rhetorical shift in the meanings attached to terms \nlike \u2018wider determinants of health\u2019, or of confusion between interventions designed to tackle \nhealth inequalities and those designed to promote health improvement, there is a clear policy \nshift away from tackling wider determinants of health and reducing health inequalities and \ntowards a focus on health improvement (a shift associated with the high-profile replacement of \nHealth Minister, Jane Hutt, in January 2005).  Despite Greer\u2019s (2003) and others\u2019 (e.g. Chaney \n& Drakeford, 2004) optimistic claims that the medical model of individualised health may be \nbeing abandoned in Wales, the publication of the on-line statement, Health Challenge Wales \n(Welsh Assembly Government, 2004), marks a return to a focus on individuals and their \nlifestyle behaviours.  Unlike the Scottish and English documents published around this time, \nHealth Challenge Wales makes no direct claims that its approach will aid the reduction of \nhealth inequalities.  Instead, it seems to mark a complete overshadowing of the health \ninequalities agenda. \n \nOverall, whilst a nuanced account of the documents could potentially highlight differences in \nthe ways in which health policy statements in all three countries have promoted the need to \ntackle lifestyle behavioural determinants vis-\u00e0-vis wider determinants, the \u2018bigger picture\u2019 \nreveals some striking similarities and a common direction of travel.  All three governments were \ninitially keen to discuss the need to tackle wider determinants of health in order to effectively \naddress health inequalities but, following something of a watershed in 2003-2004, there seems \nto be a shift in concern away from wider determinants and towards lifestyle behaviours \n(especially smoking).  It is a change of direction that seems to conflict with statements in the \nearly policy documents which point out that previous policy attempts to try to change lifestyle \nbehaviours may have contributed to widening health inequalities.  This finding suggests that a \nmedical model of health has remained remarkably persistent within health policy, despite \nevidence of initial attempts to shift the focus to a more complex, social model. \n \nFurther evidence of the dominance of a medical model of health is provided by the noticeable \nincrease in emphasis placed on the role of health services in tackling health inequalities, which \n 13 \nagain occurs in Scotland and England in 2003-2004.  Initially, whilst the policy statements from \nall three countries suggest that unequal access to, use and quality of health services are likely \nto compound health inequalities (for example, references to Julian Tudor Hart\u2019s (1971) \u2018inverse \ncare law\u2019 are evident), health services appear to have little place in either explanations for or \nstrategies to tackle health inequalities.  Furthermore, the statements from each country \nacknowledge that differences in the use and quality of health services do not explain why \npoorer groups tend to experience symptoms of chronic diseases at an earlier age than more \naffluent groups.  Over time, however, as the illustrative quotations in Table 3 demonstrate, the \ncontribution that the health services are expected to make to reducing health inequalities \nexpands significantly in the Scottish and English documents over the period of study.  The first \nquotations in each of the two rows in Table 3 illustrate the supportive role that health services \nare encouraged to play in earlier documents, whilst the second quotations in each row \ndemonstrate the far more central role outlined for the health services in more recent policy \nstatements.  \n \nTABLE 3 TO BE INSERTED HERE \n \nThis post-2003 emphasis on \u2018anticipatory care\u2019 and \u2018secondary prevention\u2019ix\n \n in Scotland and \nEngland seems likely to have been driven, at least in part, by the short-term nature of the \nnational health inequality targets (see Blackman, 2007).  This might not be expected in Wales, \nwith its longer-term and more aspirational perspective.  Yet, once again, a generally similar \nshift in emphasis is visible at around the same time.  Whilst the Welsh documents do not place \nas much emphasis as the other two countries on secondary prevention as a means of tackling \nhealth inequalities, there is a similar shift in the focus of health policy.  For example, the current \nhealth strategy, Designed for Life (Minister for Health and Social Care, 2005), makes it clear \nthat there is to be a change in emphasis towards clinical priorities, especially the reduction of \nwaiting times for treatment. This occurred in the wake of a media and political storm about \nrising waiting lists in the Welsh NHS, including adverse comparisons with England (see \nDrakeford, 2006).  This means that, despite quite different reasons for doing so, Wales has \nmirrored England and Scotland in placing an increased emphasis on clinical priorities in health \npolicy since 2003.  \n(iii) The location of responsibility for health inequalities (including for targets): \n 14 \nIt would be too simplistic to claim that there are clear shifts in the location of responsibility in \neach policy context between 1997 and 2007 as the findings suggest a more fluctuating and \ncomplex picture.  However, once again, the analysis does reveal some striking cross-country \nsimilarities.  Most of the pre-2003 policy statements are rather vague about how health \ninequalities will be tackled and who should take responsibility but they do clearly suggest that \nhealth inequality is a cross-cutting issue affecting a range of government departments.  \nAlthough these documents acknowledge that success can only be achieved by working in \npartnership with local public bodies, the private and voluntary sectors and the public, they often \nsuggest that the role of central government will be significant.  In contrast, the messages in the \npost-2003 documents seem more focused on underlining the limited role central government \ncan play and on maximising the responsibility of local NHS and local government bodies and of \nindividuals.  \n \nPrimary responsibility for reducing health inequalities (including, for Scotland and England, \nmeeting the relevant targets) is placed with local NHS bodies in all three countries (these are \nPrimary Care Trusts in England and Health Boards in Scotland and Wales), although \npartnership with other agencies, especially local government, is emphasised.  Guidance on \nprecisely how the NHS is expected to achieve these reductions is initially hazy and revolves \naround suggestions that it needs to change from being a \u2018national illness service\u2019 to a \u2018national \nhealth service\u2019.  The lack of discussion about how this shift is expected to take place is \nproblematic when, as Hunter (2003: 111) points out, \u2018All available evidence suggests that the \nNHS, essentially a 'sickness' service, will never take the wider public health seriously.\u2019  \nHowever, following the publication of the Wanless Reports in England (Wanless, 2002, 2004) \nand Wales (Wanless, 2003) and the Kerr Report in Scotland (Kerr, 2005), all of which \nemphasise the need for the NHS to play a greater role in preventing ill-health, the level of \nresponsibility for reducing health inequalities that is located with health services increases. \n \nIn addition, the growing emphasis on lifestyle-behaviours from 2003 onwards (as discussed in \nthe previous section) is accompanied by a greater emphasis on individual responsibility for \nhealth.  For example: \n \nChoosing Health (Secretary of State for Health, 2004): \u2018In our survey, 88% of \nrespondents agreed that individuals are responsible for their own health. Health is a \n 15 \nvery personal issue. People do not want to be told how to live their lives or for \nGovernment to make decisions for them.\u2019 \n \nDelivering for Health (Scottish Executive, 2005): \u2018We are working to encourage people \nto take greater control over their own health.\u2019 \n \nHealth Challenge Wales (Welsh Assembly Government, 2004): \u2018Health Challenge \nWales asks every individual to consider what they are doing, and what more they could \ndo, to improve their health and the health of their family.\u2019 \n \nWith this shift towards individual responsibility comes an increasingly obvious tension between \nstatements in the policy texts that acknowledge some of the key factors influencing health are \nbeyond individuals\u2019 control and statements which repeatedly underline the importance of \nindividual decision-making.  In England, and to a lesser extent in Scotland, individual \nresponsibility is often couched in terms of \u2018choice\u2019.  Where material, structural and social \ndeterminants are referred to in post-2003 statements, it tends to be local (rather than central) \ngovernment with whom responsibility for delivery is placed.  Yet the guidance provided for local \ngovernment is, like that for the NHS, often vague and revolves around suggestions that local \ngovernment bodies should act as \u2018public health organisations\u2019, focusing on the likely impact \nthat each of their activities will have on local population health. \n \nConcluding discussion \nIn contrast to existing claims about the divergent direction of post-devolution health policy in \nEngland, Scotland and Wales, the findings in this paper suggest that, at least for the issue of \nhealth inequalities, the approaches taken by the three governments have been remarkably \nsimilar, with a marked cross-country shift in policy direction occurring from 2003 onwards.  In \nparticular, despite some differences in relation to the establishment of targets for health \ninequalities, the \u2018policy problem\u2019 of health inequalities has been framed in a relatively consistent \nmanner - as a problem of a \u2018health gap\u2019 relating to the \u2018health disadvantage\u2019 of deprived \ncommunities.  As Graham and Kelly (2004) underline, the framing of the problem in this way \ninvites responses which focus on trying to improve the health of the poorest people (or people \nin the poorest areas) as quickly as possible, rather than tackling the broader, societal \nresponses advocated by many researchers in the field (e.g. Graham, 2006 and Dorling et al, \n2007).  This suggests that the possibilities for policy divergence were restricted from the start \n 16 \nby a concern not to open up debates about income and wealth inequalities, a concern which \nmay reflect the limited fiscal powers of the devolved governments (especially the Welsh \nAssembly Government) as well as Labour\u2019s 1997 election manifesto pledge not to increase \npublic spending above the rate projected by the Conservative government for at least two \nyears. \n \nThe findings also suggest that, despite a great deal of emphasis on social determinants of \nhealth in the policy statements which initially emerged from each country, a medical model of \nhealth was never entirely absent and, since 2003-2004, it is this approach to health (and health \ninequalities) which has dominated official statements.  Hence, both the Scottish and English \ndocuments place much of the responsibility for reducing health inequalities (and meeting the \nrelated targets) with the NHS.  This implies (as some of the most recent statements explicitly \nstate) that policymakers in Scotland and England perceive the major policy tools with which to \ntackle health inequalities to be those relating to health service treatments and secondary \nprevention measures (particularly smoking cessation and pharmacological interventions).  \nWhilst the Welsh statements are less prone to locate responsibility for health inequalities with \nNHS bodies, the initial focus on a social model of health was also challenged in 2004, when the \nfocus of policy statements began to shift towards clinical priorities such as the reduction of \nwaiting times (see Drakeford, 2006).  Further evidence of the dominance of a medical model of \nhealth is provided by the increasing emphasis (especially from 2003 onwards) in statements \nfrom all three polities on the importance of individual responsibility for adopting \u2018healthy\u2019 \nlifestyle behaviours.  Interventions to tackle health inequalities which focus on people who are \nconsidered \u2018at risk\u2019 of ill-health, either by trying to change their lifestyle behaviours or by \nemploying health service and pharmacological interventions, fail to address the factors which \ncause the differential patterning of those who are considered more \u2018at risk\u2019 of ill-health in the \nfirst place.  However, such interventions are likely to remain politically popular because (as \nsome of the statements implicitly acknowledge) they have the potential to produce the kinds of \nshort-term gains which rapidly moving political cycles demand. \n \nAt a rhetorical level, there is plenty of evidence that, as Greer (2003) and Chaney and \nDrakeford (2004) claim, the Welsh Assembly Government initially attempted to take a more \nradical approach to public health by placing an even greater emphasis on the wider \ndeterminants of health than either England or Scotland.  However, as Drakeford (2006) argues, \nthis commitment appears to have faltered in the face of media and political pressure to focus \n 17 \non clinical issues such as waiting times.  As a consequence, the initial indications of divergence \nwithin the field of health policy that are highlighted by analysts such as Scott Greer (2001) now \nseem outdated.  Whilst it may remain the case that different logics are promoting the \nemergence of rather different health service structures, there is less evidence of contrasting \napproaches to public health issues such as health inequalities. \n \nWhat is apparent from our analysis is that, while much of the language and the detail of policy-\nmaking convey an impression of difference, it is the similarities that invite explanation.  As \nalready discussed, two important considerations are the limited nature of devolution \narrangements within the UK (especially for Wales) and the dominance, until recently, of one \npolitical party in all three contexts.  At an institutional level, Parry\u2019s (2003, 2004) account of \npost-devolution Scotland may shed further light on our findings.  He argues that the frameworks \nfor post-devolution policies, including health, were largely set in the pre-devolution documents \npublished between 1997 and 1999.  Furthermore, Parry (2004) claims that the Scottish civil \nservice has tended to mimic the institutional traditions of Whitehall - a situation which may also \nhave occurred in Wales (see Laffin, 2007). This suggests that institutional factors may also \nhave played a role in promoting policy convergence.  Yet, the fact that Scotland was able to \nintroduce free care for the elderly and ban smoking in public places, and that Wales was able \nto phase out prescription charges, all demonstrate that policy divergence is possible, so \nquestions remain about the reasons for the lack of policy divergence in relation to health \ninequalities. \n \nThe apparent convergence of policy approaches to health inequalities may be the result of \n\u2018policy transfer\u2019 between the three polities (although it is impossible to make a judgement about \nthis based on the analysis of policy statements alone).  Alternatively, to understand policy \napproaches to a \u2018wicked issue\u2019 such as this, it may be necessary to reflect on wider cultural and \nsocietal trends, such as rising individualism and its relation to happiness (see Layard, 2005) or \nthe pressures of economic globalisation and the influence of neoliberal ideologies in reducing \nthe role of the state (Mooney et al, 2006).  Each of these explanations underlines the need for \nfurther research to explore the processes involved in post-devolution policymaking. \n \nPolitical devolution is, of course, a process rather than an event and it will take more than ten \nyears to be able to assess its eventual impact on social policy.  Indeed, as the arrangements \nfor devolution continue to evolve and new political parties assume power (as has happened in \n 18 \nScotland following the parliamentary election in May 2007iv), we will be better able to reflect on \nthe extent to which it has been the specific political and policy contexts of the past decade \nwhich have constrained policy divergence or whether other, more deep-seated forces are at \nplay, either within Britain or emanating from perceptions of, and responses to, wider societal or \nglobal pressures. \n \nIn the meantime, the findings discussed in this paper raise important questions about  the \nextent to which divergence has been possible at the local (sub-national) level, a point which the \nfindings from the wider project will address (Blackman et al., 2006).  These are not, however, \nquestions which can be answered through the analysis of national policy statements.  The aim \nof this paper has been more modest, namely, to explore how health inequalities have been \nconstructed as a policy problem in England, Scotland and Wales and, in so doing, to challenge \nexisting claims about the extent of health policy divergence between the three polities over the \npast decade. \n \n 19 \nReferences: \nAcheson, D.

Strengthening primary care teams and promoting anticipatory care in disadvantaged \nareas will reduce health inequalities\u2026\u2019 \n \n                                                 \ni Since their election to government in 2007, the Scottish National Party have renamed the \u2018Scottish Executive\u2019 the \n\u2018Scottish Government\u2019.  However, the title \u2018Scottish Executive\u2019 has been retained for the purposes of this paper, \ngiven that this was the title in use during the period of study. \nii The Government of Wales Act (2006) somewhat extended the powers devolved to Wales.  However, for the \nperiod in which this paper is interested, the Welsh Assembly Government has only been able to legislate where it \nwas empowered to do so by a complex and vast array of Westminster laws. \niii Devolved powers were also granted to a Northern Ireland Assembly but as the political situation here has been \nso volatile and uncertain (with direct rule being re-imposed for over three months in 2000, twice in 2001, and again \nfrom 2002 until the spring of 2007), developments in relation to health policy have been significantly restricted.  \nConsequently, we decided not to include it in this comparative study. \niv This dominance is no longer the case in Scotland, where the Scottish National Party formed a minority \ngovernment following the 2007 elections, and has been weakened in Wales by the forced coalition of Labour with \nPlaid Cymru. \nv The meaning of the term varies widely and is one of the issues that the overall project explores. \nvi For example, whilst the English documents pay a little more attention to health differences between ethnic \ngroups, gender health differences and inequalities in mental health are most discernible in the Scottish \ndocuments, and the Welsh discussions more frequently highlight the issues facing traveller communities and the \ndifferences between language groups.  Additionally, discussions of health inequalities in Scottish policy \nstatements are often linked to notions of social justice, whilst in Wales the emphasis has been more around the \nconcept of wellbeing. \nvii Whilst this policy emphasis may seem unsurprising, it is worth noting that it is a focus which contrasts \nsignificantly with the broader equalities strategies of the three countries, which tend to focus on ethnicity, gender, \nsexuality and religion, and pay almost no attention to differences between social classes. \nviii The wording of the life expectancy target was later revised (Department of Health, 2002), following the \nreplacement of local Health Authorities with much larger Strategic Health Authorities, to focus on \u2018Local \nAuthorities\u2019 (rather than \u2018Health Authorities) so as to retain the focus on local areas. \n 25 \n                                                                                                                                            \nix This involves clinical and pharmaceutical interventions such as the prescription of statins to people at high risk of \nheart disease or angioplasty surgery for people experiencing angina. \n \n \nShort author biography: \nKatherine E.
