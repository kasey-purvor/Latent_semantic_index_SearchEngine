We performed a statistical analysis of the occur-\nrence distribution of Doppler spectral width around the day-\nside high-latitude ionosphere using data from the conjugate\nradar pair composed of the CUTLASS Iceland-East radar in\nthe Northern Hemisphere and the SENSU Syowa-East radar\nin the Southern Hemisphere. Three types of spectral width\ndistribution were identified: (1) an exponential-like distri-\nbution in the lower magnetic latitudes (below 72\u25e6), (2) a\nGaussian-like distribution around a few degrees magnetic lat-\nitude, centered on 78\u25e6, and (3) another type of distribution\nin the higher magnetic latitudes (above 80\u25e6). The first two\nare considered to represent the geophysical regimes such as\nthe LLBL and the cusp, respectively, because they are sim-\nilar to the spectral width distributions within the LLBL and\nthe cusp, as classified by Baker et al. (1995). The distri-\nbution found above 80\u25e6 magnetic latitude has been clarified\nfor the first time in this study. This distribution has similar-\nities to the exponential-like distribution in the lower latitude\npart, although clear differences also exist in their character-\nistics. These three spectral width distributions are commonly\nidentified in conjugate hemispheres. The latitudinal transi-\ntion from one distribution to another exhibits basically the\nsame trend between two hemispheres. There is, however,\nan interhemispheric difference in the form of the distribution\naround the cusp latitudes, such that spectral width values ob-\ntained from Syowa-East are larger than those from Iceland-\nEast. On the basis of the spectral width characteristics, the\naverage locations of the cusp and the open\/closed field line\nboundary are estimated statistically.\nKey words.

Hosokawa\n(hosokawa@kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp)\n1 Introduction\nDetermining the open\/closed field line boundary (OCFLB)\naround the dayside ionosphere enables us to estimate several\ngeophysical parameters such as (1) the rate of reconnection\nat the magnetopause, (2) the size of polar cap, and (3) the cre-\nation and destruction of open magnetic flux associated with\nthe dayside and nightside reconnection. Direct observations\nof the cusp particle precipitation by the low-altitude space-\ncrafts such as DMSP (e.g. Newell and Meng, 1988, 1991) are\nmost widely utilized as a proxy for the OCFLB. The optical\nauroral signature triggered by cusp particle precipitation has\nalso been a good guide for the identification of the OCFLB\n(Sandholt et al., 1998).\nThe dayside auroral zone provides a good target for HF\nradars (Milan et al., 1998). A relationship between the mag-\nnetospheric cusp particle precipitation into the ionosphere\nand the HF radar backscatter from the ionospheric F region\nhas been reported by a number of authors (Baker et al., 1990,\n1995; Rodger et al., 1995; Yeoman et al., 1997). They\ndemonstrated that the equatorward edge of radar backscat-\nter showing broad Doppler spectral widths is coincident with\nthe equatorward edge of the cusp particle precipitation. Fur-\nthermore, the equatorward edge of these regions of HF radar\nbackscatter appear to correspond closely to the equatorward\nedge of the 630.00 nm (red line) aurora during the period of\nnegative IMF Bz (Rodger et al., 1995; Milan et al., 1999;\nMoen et al., 2001). Baker et al. (1995) analyzed the HF\nradar data for eight cusp events and eight low-latitude bound-\nary layer (LLBL) events which were identified by the DMSP\nsatellite. They reported that the distribution of observed\nspectral widths in the cusp is significantly different from that\nobserved in the LLBL. The distribution of spectral widths\nwithin the cusp is a broad Gaussian shaped distribution,\nwhose average is around 220 m s\u22121 (termed cusp-type distri-\nbution in this paper). In contrast, the distribution of spectral\nwidths in the LLBL is more similar to an exponential distri-\nbution, with the peak occurring at about 50 m s\u22121 (termed\n1214 K.

The solid fan-shaped area indicates the field-of-view of Syowa-\nEast and dashed indicates that of Iceland-East. The summary points and the field-of-view of Syowa-East radar are mapped into the Northern\nHemisphere using the IGRF95 model. Open circles indicate the summary points of Iceland-East from C0 to C15 and filled circles indicate\nthose of Syowa-East from S0 to S15.\nLLBL-type distribution in this paper). The boundary be-\ntween these two types of spectral width distribution has been\nconsidered to be the OCFLB in the HF radar observation,\nthough it is possible that there is a displacement of radar sig-\nnature of the OCFLB from the real OCFLB (for a discussion,\nsee Milan et al., 2001b).\nA number of previous papers have examined the HF radar\nspectral width signatures around the dayside ionosphere\nthrough case studies, and also statistical characteristics of\nspectral width have been examined by Villain et al. (2002)\nusing the data from all the Northern Hemisphere Super-\nDARN radars. However, there have been only a few simul-\ntaneous observations of the cusp and the OCFLB using the\ndata from magnetic conjugate radars (Pinnock et al., 1999;\nMilan and Lester, 2001). These conjugate studies employed\nthe data of the Polar Anglo-American Conjugate Radar Ex-\nperiment (PACE) radars located at Goose Bay, Canada, and\nHalley, Antarctica which are part of the SuperDARN chain\n(Greenwald et al., 1995). In this paper, we employed an-\nother magnetic conjugate radar pair in the SuperDARN chain\nwhich is composed of the Iceland-East radar of the Coor-\ndinated UK Twin-Located Auroral Sounding System (CUT-\nLASS) and the Syowa-East radar of Syowa-South and East\nHF Radars of NIPR for SuperDARN (SENSU). For the first\ntime, statistical characteristics of spectral width distributions\nin magnetically conjugate ionospheres have been compared.\nConsequently, significant interhemispheric differences in the\ncharacteristics of spectral width distribution are found and\nthe statistical locations of the cusp and the OCFLB were de-\ntermined in both hemispheres.\n2 Database and analysis\n2.1 Statistics database\nCommon Time Operation data of CUTLASS Iceland-East\nin the Northern Hemisphere and SENSU Syowa-East in the\nSouthern Hemisphere have been employed for this study. In\nthe current version of Common Time Operation Normal Scan\nMode, the radar scans through 16 beams, each beam being\nbinned into 75 range gates (70 range gates in the case of\nSENSU radars). Hence, one complete scan, obtained every\n2 min, covers a fan-shaped area with 1200 cells (1120 cells\nfor SENSU radars). To allow for statistical analysis of long\nperiods of observations, Milan et al. (1997) designated 16\ncells from the total of 1200 as \u201csummary points\u201d and created\na data base for the CUTLASS radars. In a similar way, we de-\ntermined summary points and constructed a data base for the\nSENSU Syowa-East radar. In the statistical analysis, we used\nthe 36 months of data from January 1998 to December 2000\nof CUTLASS Iceland-East and SENSU Syowa-East radars.\nFigure 1 presents the location of the summary point arrays\nin the field-of-view of CUTLASS Iceland-East and SENSU\nSyowa-East, which are mapped into the AACGM coordinate\nsystem (based on Baker and Wing, 1989) in the Northern\nK.

Open circles indicate the summary\npoints of Iceland-East (from C0 to C15) and filled circles in-\ndicate those of Syowa-East (from S0 to S15). We emphasize\nthat the Syowa-East summary points from S0 to S11 are de-\ntermined to be located to the magnetic conjugate point of the\nIceland-East summary points from C4 to C15. Intersection\nof the two summary point arrays ranges from 70\u25e6 to 81\u25e6 in\nmagnetic latitude, which lies from the average position of\nthe LLBL to the polar cap, through the OCFLB and the cusp\nin the radar observation around the dayside ionosphere. The\ndifference in magnetic longitude of the overlapping points is\napproximately 10\u25e6.\nTo clarify the characteristics of spectral width distribution\nin the dayside high-latitude ionospheres, we used the radar\ndata taken during 6 h of magnetic local time centered at lo-\ncal magnetic noon (09:00\u201315:00 MLT). Echoes that are con-\nsidered to be ground scatter were excluded on the basis of\nFITACF analysis (Villain et al., 1987; Baker et al., 1995).\nFurthermore, echoes which do not have a sufficiently strong\nsignal (< 3 dB signal-to-noise ratio) were eliminated in or-\nder to remove much of the ghost scatter due to radio interfer-\nence. After the elimination of non-ionospheric backscatter,\nwe classified the spectral widths into twenty five bins cover-\ning 0\u2013500 m s\u22121, each with a range of 20 m s\u22121, and investi-\ngated the occurrence distribution of the spectral widths.\n2.2 Geophysical bias\nFor the time interval from January 1998 to December 2000,\nwe obtained 63 443 observations of spectral width at the\nsummary points of the Syowa-East radar in the Southern\nHemisphere and 50 730 the Iceland-East radar in the North-\nern Hemisphere. The Syowa-East radar observes about 25%\nmore backscatter than the Iceland-East radar. The occurrence\nof ionospheric backscatter is strongly affected by the HF\npropagation condition that is mainly associated with iono-\nspheric electron density structure (Milan et al., 1997). Thus,\nthe difference in the data points between the two radars might\nbe due to the difference in the propagation condition between\nthe two hemispheres. Although there is a slight difference in\nthe data points between the two radars, the number of data\npoints is large enough to illustrate the average characteristics\nof the spectral width distribution in both hemispheres. When\nwe process a large data set in a statistical manner, it is very\nimportant to characterize the data base. Here, geophysical\nbiases in our data base due to season and magnetic local time\nare examined and their effects on our statistical analysis are\nestimated.\nAll of the SuperDARN HF radars have an enhanced prob-\nability of observing ionospheric scatters around the dayside\nlocal time sector during the winter months (Ruohoniemi and\nGreenwald, 1997; Milan et al., 1997; Hosokawa et al., 2001).\nThis winter effect might be caused by the differences in the\n1216 K.

Color-coded number of data points as a function of magnetic local time obtained by (a) SENSU Syowa-East radar and (b) CUTLASS\nIceland-East radar during the interval of our statistical analysis.

The vertical axis shows the\nsummary points from S0 to S15 for Syowa-East (data of\nS3 are not displayed in this figure, because S3 has no cor-\nresponding summary point in Iceland-East) and C0 to C15\nfor Iceland-East, and the horizontal axis is the month of the\nyear. Since the summary points of Syowa-East are located\nat relatively higher latitudes compared with those of Iceland-\nEast, Fig. 2a is shifted by 4 summary points upward along\nthe vertical axis. Our statistical database also exhibits an en-\nhancement of backscatter occurrence during winter months\nin both hemispheres. Hence, the statistical results obtained\nin this study are considered to be dominated by the data ob-\nserved during the winter months. However, the coverage of\nthe data employed in this study extends from January 1998\nto December 2000, and both radars cover three winters in\ncommon. This suggests that this winter effect cannot be a\nmajor bias on our statistical analysis of the spectral width.\nOn the other hand, summer data are mainly obtained by the\nSyowa-East at magnetic latitudes below S8 (approximately\n77\u25e6). It could affect the interhemispheric comparison at the\nlow-latitude part of the summary point array, but not within\nthe average latitudes of the cusp.\nFigure 3 gives the number of data points color-coded\nas a function of magnetic local time, between 09:00 and\n15:00 MLT, and summary points obtained by (a) SENSU\nSyowa-East radar and (b) CUTLASS Iceland-East radar. A\nlarge amount of data points is obtained in the postnoon sec-\ntor for the case of the Iceland-East radar. This tendency is\nconsistent with the backscatter occurrence statistics of the\nIceland-East radar provided by Milan et al. (1997). In con-\ntrast, the distribution of the data points in the Syowa-East\nradar is more uniform with magnetic local time than that in\nIceland-East. This result suggests that there is a considerable\ndifference in data point distribution between the two radars\nand we must keep in mind the possibility that this could in-\ntroduce a bias on the statistical analysis of spectral width.\nThe effect of this bias on the spectral width distribution is\nalso discussed in the next section.\n3 Statistical results\n3.1 Latitudinal variation of the spectral width distribution\nFigure 4 gives the occurrence distribution of spectral widths\nobserved by (a) the SENSU Syowa-East radar and (b) the\nCUTLASS Iceland-East radar, within the magnetic local\ntimes from 09:00 to 15:00 MLT.

The\nvertical axis indicates the summary points from S0 to S15 for Syowa-East and C0 to C15 for Iceland-East, and the horizontal axis is the\nspectral width.\nsummary points and the horizontal axis is the spectral width.\nThe percentage occurrence distribution for each summary\npoint is normalized by the total number of points at that sum-\nmary point. Coverage of the summary points extends from\n70\u25e6 to 86\u25e6 for Syowa-East and from 66\u25e6 to 81\u25e6 for Iceland-\nEast. Hence, the region where we can compare directly the\nspectral width distributions of both radars ranges from S0 to\nS11 in Syowa-East and C4 to C15 in Iceland-East, which\ncorresponds to the magnetic latitude range of 70\u25e6\u201381\u25e6. One\nthing we must note is that the peaks of the occurrence at first\nspectral width bins (0\u201320 m s\u22121) in the Syowa-East data are\nmainly due to a contamination of ground scatter and are out\nof scope for this paper. This means that backscatter echoes\nexist from the ground, whose Doppler velocity is larger than\nthe criterion for identifying ground scatter in the FITACF\nprocedure.\nFigure 4b shows that the occurrences are fairly localized\naround the spectral width values that are less than 150 m s\u22121\nat the magnetic latitudes below 70\u25e6, which is equivalent to\nthe summary points between C0 and C4 in Iceland-East.\nAlso within the magnetic latitudes between 70\u25e6 and 72\u25e6,\nwhich correspond to the summary points between S0 and\nS2 of Syowa-East and between C4 and C6 of Iceland-East,\nnarrow spectral width values that are less than 200 m s\u22121\nare dominant in both radars. These features correspond\nto the LLBL-type spectral width distribution, as identified\nby Baker et al. (1995). Above 72\u25e6 magnetic latitude, the\nform of the distribution gradually changes as the magnetic\nlatitude increases and another type of distribution appears\naround magnetic latitudes centered at S9 in Syowa-East and\nC12 in Iceland-East, that is approximately 78\u25e6. Around\nthis magnetic latitude, the occurrence rate of narrow spec-\ntral width becomes lower and spectral widths are distributed\nin a broader range. This type of distribution is considered\nto correspond to the cusp-type distribution as described in\nBaker et al. (1995). Transition from the LLBL-type spectral\nwidth distribution to the cusp-type is seen around the mag-\nnetic latitudes from 74\u25e6 to 76\u25e6 in both hemispheres. It is also\nworth noting that the narrow spectral width values tend to\nbe dominant again above 80\u25e6 in magnetic latitude. This ten-\ndency is most clearly seen in Syowa-East, although there is\nsome evidence for this in the data from Iceland-East. These\nobservations suggest that another type of spectral width dis-\ntribution exists above 80\u25e6 in magnetic latitude. This type of\ndistribution has similarities to the LLBL-type spectral width\ndistribution, but clear differences exist in their characteris-\ntics. The details of these three types of spectral width distri-\nbutions will be discussed in the later part of this section.\n3.2 Longitudinal variation of the spectral width distribution\nAs noted in the previous section, bias due to the data point\ndistribution in magnetic local time direction could affect the\nstatistical results shown in Fig. 4, because we merged the\n1218 K. Hosokawa et al.: Spectral width statistics from the conjugate SuperDARN radars\nFig. 5. Variation of spectral width distribution with magnetic local time. The distributions are shown in same form of contour as Fig. 4\nfor three magnetic local time sectors: prenoon sector (09:00\u201311:00 MLT; top panel), noon sector (11:00\u201313:00 MLT; middle panel), and\npostnoon sector (13:00\u201315:00 MLT; bottom panel), respectively.\ndata measured in the interval from 09:00 to 15:00 MLT in\nFig. 4. Figure 5 shows the variation of spectral width distri-\nbution with magnetic local time for both radars. The distri-\nbutions are shown in a contour similar form for three mag-\nnetic local time sectors: prenoon sector (09:00\u201311:00 MLT,\ntop panels), noon sector (11:00\u201313:00 MLT, middle panel)\nand postnoon sector (13:00\u201315:00 MLT, bottom panels), re-\nspectively. Although the number of data points is different\nK. Hosokawa et al.: Spectral width statistics from the conjugate SuperDARN radars 1219\n(a) (b) \n(c) (d) \nFig. 6.

This fact suggests that bias due\nto the data point distribution in magnetic local time direc-\ntion does not affect the spectral width distribution drastically,\nwhich allows us to investigate the characteristics of spectral\nwidth around the dayside ionosphere, using the data obtained\nwithin the magnetic local time from 09:00 to 15:00 MLT.\n3.3 Form of the spectral width distribution\nThe most significant finding in Fig. 4 is that the spectral\nwidth distributions obtained in conjugate hemispheres ex-\nhibit the same general trend with latitude. However, the dis-\ntribution of spectral widths measured by Syowa-East within\nthe average position of the cusp (around a few degrees mag-\nnetic latitude centered on 78\u25e6) differs from that at Iceland-\nEast. The bottom two panels of Fig. 6 show the histograms\nof the spectral width distribution at (c) S1 in Syowa-East and\n(d) C5 in Iceland-East. The magnetic latitudes of these sum-\nmary points are approximately 71\u25e6, a latitude at which the\nLLBL-type distribution dominates. The distribution of spec-\ntral widths takes the approximate form of an exponential dis-\ntribution in both hemispheres, with most values lying within\nthe range of 0 to 200 m s\u22121. One difference at these mag-\nnetic latitudes is that the Syowa-East data have a large peak\nin the first spectral width bin, 0\u201320 m s\u22121. This peak is due to\nthe contamination of the backscatter echoes from the ground\nand has no relation to the geophysical structures in the iono-\nsphere. Hence, no considerable difference exists in the char-\nacteristics of the spectral width distribution between the two\nradars at these magnetic latitudes.\nThe upper two panels of Fig. 6 show the distribution\nof spectral width at (a) S9 in Syowa-East and (b) C12 in\nIceland-East. The magnetic latitude of these summary points\nis about 78\u25e6. In the case of Syowa-East, the distribution\nof the spectral widths is a broad Gaussian shape, with the\npeak at about 220 m s\u22121, which is in good agreement with\nthe cusp-type spectral width distribution found by Baker et\nal. (1995). However, the distribution is slightly wider in com-\nparison with the one found by Baker et al. (1995), i.e. the per-\ncentage of very high spectral width (> 350 m s\u22121) is higher.\nThis is due to the fact that the spectral width values used in\nthis study are computed with a different version of the FI-\nTACF program than the one Baker et al. (1995) used in their\nstudy. Indeed, the spectral widths observed by Iceland-East\nare distributed in a broad range from 50 to 400 m s\u22121, how-\never, the peak is found at 100 m s\u22121. The spectral width val-\nues obtained from Iceland-East tend to be smaller than those\n1220 K. Hosokawa et al.: Spectral width statistics from the conjugate SuperDARN radars\nFig. 7. The histogram of the spectral width distribution at S1\n(shaded) and S13 (black line) in Syowa-East.\nobtained from Syowa-East and by Baker et al. (1995). The\nreason why the distributions of Iceland-East are quite differ-\nent from that of Syowa-East within the cusp is discussed in\nthe next section.\nAs displayed in Fig. 4, another type of spectral width dis-\ntribution exists above 80\u25e6 in magnetic latitude. This tendency\nis clearly seen in the Syowa-East, although there is some\nevidence for this in the data from Iceland-East. Figure 7\nshows the histograms of the spectral width distribution at S1\n(shaded) and S13 (black line) in Syowa-East. This distribu-\ntion has similarities to the LLBL-type spectral width distribu-\ntion, but there are the following clear differences: (1) the oc-\ncurrence of higher spectral width values (above 200 m s\u22121) is\nhigher, (2) the maximum of the distribution is found approx.\nabove 100 m s\u22121, slightly greater than that of the LLBL-type\ndistribution, and (3) the occurrence of low spectral width val-\nues (less than 100 m s\u22121) is smaller. This feature has not\nbeen identified in previous studies and an interpretation of\nthis type of distribution will be discussed in the next section.\n4 Discussion\n4.1 Generation mechanisms of broad spectral width\nTo investigate the spectral width characteristics in detail,\nthe median value of the distribution is computed for both\nradars and presented in Fig. 8. The results from Syowa-\nEast are displayed with filled circles and those from Iceland-\nEast are displayed with open circles, respectively. The lati-\ntudinal transition of the median value exhibits basically the\nsame trend between conjugate hemispheres, namely the me-\ndian of the distribution steadily increases from S0 to S10 for\nSyowa-East and from C0 to C12 for Iceland-East, and de-\ncreases from S10 to S14 for Syowa-East and C12 to C15 for\nIceland-East. Recently, Andre\u00b4 et al. (2000a) have proposed\nthat high frequency (Pc1) wave activity associated with the\ncusp contains highly variable electric fields which broaden\nthe HF radar spectra. Most of these waves are attributed to\nelectromagnetic ion cyclotron waves generated at the day-\nside magnetopause in the equatorial plane. Andre\u00b4 et al.\n(2000a) also pointed out that small-scale vortices of iono-\nspheric convection, which are generated by the field-aligned\ncurrent with structured soft electron precipitation from the\ndayside magnetosheath (Schiffler et al., 1997; Huber and\nSofko, 2000), can broaden the spectra around the dayside\nionosphere. Since both of these activities, wave and parti-\ncle precipitation, are considered to propagate into the conju-\ngate ionospheres along the magnetic field line, the ideas pro-\nposed by Andre\u00b4 et al. (2000a) can explain consistently the\ninterhemispheric similarity in the latitudinal trend of spectral\nwidth distribution.\nPresent statistical analysis has also shown that there ex-\nists another type of spectral width distribution in the higher\nmagnetic latitudes (above 80\u25e6). This distribution has simi-\nlarities to the LLBL-type spectral width distribution found in\nthe lower latitudes (below 72\u25e6), however, the occurrence of\nlarge spectral width values clearly tends to be higher. There\nare two possible interpretations of this distribution. One is\nthat this distribution represents characteristics of particle pre-\ncipitation peculiar to the domain poleward of the cusp, i.e.\nthe mantle region. The mantle region consists of very low\nenergy ions, with a low density (Newell et al., 1991). This\nspecific nature of particle precipitation might produce the\nspectral width feature that different from the LLBL-type and\ncusp-type distributions.\nThe other possible interpretation is that the distribution\nat the highest magnetic latitude part is a result of the iono-\nspheric signature of the cusp precipitation during northward\nIMF. During the period of northward IMF, the cusp is gener-\nally located at higher magnetic latitude, and characteristics of\nthe cusp precipitation are also expected to be different from\nthat for the southward IMF case. Since our statistical anal-\nysis merged northward and southward IMF conditions, this\nsignature might affect the spectral width distribution at the\nhigher latitude regime.\n4.2 Interhemispheric differences in spectral width values\nAs shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 8, there exists a interhemispheric\ndifference in the spectral width characteristics around the av-\nerage latitudes of the cusp, although the latitudinal trend of\nthe spectral width distribution exhibits basically the same be-\nhavior. The form of the distribution is slightly different, and\nthe median of the distribution obtained from Syowa-East is\nlarger than that from Iceland-East, in particular the difference\nreaches 100 m s\u22121 around 78\u25e6. This kind of interhemispheric\nasymmetry in the spectral width characteristics was also re-\nported in a case study basis by Milan and Lester (2001). They\nemployed the other conjugate radar pair composed of Super-\nDARN Goose Bay and Halley radars and demonstrated that\nK. Hosokawa et al.: Spectral width statistics from the conjugate SuperDARN radars 1221\nspectral width values obtained in the Southern Hemisphere\nare larger than those in the Northern Hemisphere.\nFirst, we discuss the possibility of instrumental effects,\nsuch as the difference in beam width or noise level, on this\ninterhemispheric asymmetry. If the interhemispheric differ-\nence in our statistics is due to an instrumental effect, the dif-\nference has to be found in common at all magnetic latitudes.\nHowever, the difference in spectral width values is smaller\naround the magnetic latitude below 72\u25e6, with differences in\nmedian values being approximately less than 30 m s\u22121. Also,\nthe form of the distributions within the lower magnetic lati-\ntudes of the summary point arrays is quite similar between\ntwo hemispheres. This fact suggests that an instrumental ef-\nfect does not make a significant contribution to the interhemi-\nspheric asymmetry in spectral width distributions.\nNext, we discuss the effect of contamination by non F-\nregion backscatters. SuperDARN radars often observe the\nspectra that includes several sources, such as F-region scatter,\nE-region scatter and ground scatter. Milan et al. (1997) re-\nported that Type I E-region backscatter echoes, as well as F-\nregion backscatter, can be observed at far radar ranges during\nwinter months. Barthes et al. (1998) demonstrated that if the\nspectra is composed of both ionospheric and ground scatter,\nthe spectral width value derived from the FITACF analysis\ncontains error. Chisham and Pinnock (2002) also pointed out\nthat contamination by non F-region backscatter contributes\nto the velocity determination of SuperDARN observations.\nIn our statistical analysis, however, the interhemispheric dif-\nference of the median value is up to 100 m s\u22121 (see Fig. 8),\nwhich is considered to be too large to be explained only by\nthe contamination of non F-region backscatters. Also, as is\nnot shown in this paper, contaminations by ground and E-\nregion backscatters are commonly found in the observations\nof Iceland-East and Syowa-East, which also confirms that the\neffect of non F-region backscatter makes a minor contribu-\ntion to the interhemispheric difference in the spectral width\ndistribution.\nThe other possibility is that the spectral width distribution\naround 78\u25e6 magnetic latitude in the Northern Hemisphere\nis a mixture of the cusp-type and LLBL-type distributions,\nwhile that in the Southern Hemisphere is dominated only\nby the cusp-type spectral width distribution. The summary\npoints of Iceland-East and Syowa-East are magnetically con-\njugate, however, their geographic latitudes and longitudes are\nslightly different. This displacement could cause the differ-\nence in the radio-wave propagation path or scattering condi-\ntion. Hence, the Iceland-East radar could observe the LLBL-\ntype spectral width feature even in the average latitude of the\ncusp.\nIn addition to the contribution by the high-frequency wave\nactivity and small-scale convection vortex created by soft\nparticle precipitation, the gradient in the velocity distribu-\ntion, which results from geometry of the radar with respect\nto the large-scale convection pattern, also broadens the HF\nradar spectra (Barthes et al., 1998; Andre\u00b4 et al., 2000a).\nMilan et al. (2001a) demonstrated that the dayside convec-\ntion pattern could exhibit considerable asymmetries between\nFig. 8. The median value of the spectral width distribution for\nSyowa-East and Iceland-East. The results from Syowa-East is dis-\nplayed as a line with filled circles, those from Iceland-East being\ndisplayed as a line with open circles. Filled small circles indicate\nthe upper quartile and lower quartile, respectively.\nsummer and winter hemispheres, as a consequence of the bi-\nases in the reconnection geometries available at the subsolar\nmagnetopause. Pinnock et al. (1999) also presented that there\nexists a considerable interhemispheric difference in convec-\ntion velocity around the dayside ionosphere. These obser-\nvational facts are confirmed by the modeling work of Cole-\nman et al. (2000). This effect is imposed by the tilts of the\ndipole and rotation axes relative to the Sun-Earth line. As\nmentioned before, the summary points of Iceland-East and\nSyowa-East are magnetically conjugate, however, their geo-\ngraphic latitudes and longitudes are different, which might\ncause an interhemispheric asymmetry in plasma convection\npatterns observed by the conjugate radars. If the plasma con-\nvection has an asymmetry between both hemispheres, then\nobserved spectral widths could also exhibit a considerable\ndifference between conjugate ionospheres by the effect of a\ngradient in the velocity distribution, as estimated by Andre\u00b4\net al. (2000a). However, we investigated three whole years\nof spectral width observations in a statistical fashion. Hence,\nit is still an open question whether the difference in iono-\nspheric convection could contribute to the interhemispheric\nasymmetry of spectral width characteristics even in statisti-\ncal description. Statistical analysis of spectral width using\nanother conjugate radar pair is needed for the further under-\n1222 K. Hosokawa et al.: Spectral width statistics from the conjugate SuperDARN radars\nstanding of this interhemispheric difference.\n4.3 Comparison with the other observations\nWe now turn to the identification of the cusp and the OCFLB\nfrom the HF radar spectral width characteristics. In Fig. 8,\nthe median of the distribution has its maximum at S10 of\nSyowa-East and C12 of Iceland-East, where magnetic lati-\ntude \u2248 78.0\u25e6. This could be regarded as the statistical loca-\ntion of the cusp center, as determined by the HF radar spec-\ntral width characteristics, which is in good agreement be-\ntween conjugate hemispheres. Newell and Meng (1992) em-\nployed the data of the DMSP satellites\u2019 dayside passes and\nclarified the average position of the cusp statistically. They\nfound that the particle precipitations peculiar to the cusp are\nobserved in a region between latitudes of 75.0\u25e6 and 82.0\u25e6,\nwith the center approximately 78.0\u25e6. The statistical loca-\ntion of the cusp center identified by the HF radar and the\nDMSP is fairly consistent in both hemispheres. Furthermore,\nthe latitude at which the spectral width distribution begins to\nreturn to an exponential-like distribution is again similar to\nthe poleward limit of the particle precipitation cusp. These\nfacts confirm that the identification of the cusp, using HF\nradar spectral width characteristics, is valid for the study of\nthe magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling process in addition\nto the other observations, such as the particle precipitation\nand the aurora.\nIn the study of case examples (e.g. Baker et al., 1997;\nPinnock et al., 1999), a well-defined boundary between nar-\nrow spectra at a low latitude and broad spectra at a high lat-\nitude has been used as a proxy for the OCFLB. This sug-\ngests that the transition region between the LLBL-type and\nthe cusp-type spectral width distributions is considered to be\nthe dayside OCFLB in a statistical sense. It is, however, still\na considerable debate as to whether the LLBL is on open\nor closed field lines (for a discussion, see Lockwood, 1997).\nHence, we must keep in mind that our statistical estimation of\nthe OCFLB location using spectral width is on the assump-\ntion that the LLBL is on a closed field line. The latitudinal\nlocation of the OCFLB is highly controlled by the state of\nthe dayside reconnection at the magnetopause, triggered by\nthe north-south component of the IMF. Also, the magnetic\nlatitude of the OCFLB is expected to vary with magnetic lo-\ncal time mainly by the effect of the east-west component of\nthe IMF (Rodger, 2000). Hence, the exact location of the\nOCFLB cannot be determined by the present statistical anal-\nysis, because the data have not been classified by the IMF\norientation and magnetic local time sector. However, we can\nroughly estimate the magnetic latitudes where the OCFLB is\nnormally formed. On the basis of the statistical results from\nSyowa-East (Fig. 4(a) and Fig. 8), the distribution starts to\nchange remarkably at the magnetic latitude between S5 and\nS7. These summary points correspond to the magnetic lati-\ntudes between 74\u25e6 and 76\u25e6.\n5 Summary and conclusion\nCharacteristics of the spectral width distribution were inves-\ntigated using the conjugate radar pair composed of CUT-\nLASS Iceland-East in the Northern Hemisphere and SENSU\nSyowa-East in the Southern Hemisphere.\nThree types of spectral width distribution were identified,\n(1) an exponential-like distribution in the lower magnetic lat-\nitudes (below 72\u25e6), (2) a Gaussian-like distribution around\na few degrees magnetic latitude, centered on 78\u25e6, and (3)\nanother type of distribution in the higher magnetic latitude\n(above 80\u25e6). The first two are considered to represent the\nLLBL and the cusp, respectively, because they are similar\nto the spectral width distributions within the LLBL and the\ncusp as classified by Baker et al. (1995). The distribution\nfound poleward of the cusp has been clarified for the first\ntime in this study. This distribution has similarities to the\nexponential-like distribution in the lower latitude part of the\nradar observation, however, clear differences exist in their\ncharacteristics.\nThese features were commonly identified in conjugate\nhemispheres. The latitudinal transition of the distribu-\ntion exhibits basically the same trend between two hemi-\nspheres, but there is an interhemispheric difference in the\nform of the distribution within the cusp, such that the spec-\ntral width values obtained from Syowa-East are larger than\nthose from Iceland-East. Average locations of the cusp and\nthe open\/closed field line boundary (OCFLB) are determined\nfrom the spectral width characteristics. The average position\nof the cusp center is found to be 78\u25e6 in AACGM magnetic\nlatitude, which is consistent with the identification of the\ncusp using the DMSP satellite by Newell and Meng (1992).\nAlso, the OCFLB is identified to be positioned within the\nmagnetic latitude between 74\u25e6 and 76\u25e6.\nAcknowledgements.
