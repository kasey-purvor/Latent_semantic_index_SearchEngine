Introduction \nOptical techniques have been considered as powerful tools for the development of chemical \nand biological sensors [1\u20133]. In particular, the combination of optical fibers and nanomaterials \nprovides a prospect for the fabrication of sensors with high sensitivity and that offer specific \nresponse to targeted chemical species [4\u20136]. A long period grating (LPG) is a periodic \nmodulation of the refractive index (RI) of the core of the fiber, with a period that typically lies \nwithin the range of 10 \u00b5m\u20131 mm [4]. The LPG couples the light from the forward propagating \nmode of the core to a discrete set of co-propagating cladding modes at wavelengths governed \nby the phase matching condition [7]: \n ( ) ( )( )x core clad xn n\u03bb = \u2212 \u039b   (1) \nwhere \u03bb(x) represents the wavelength at which the coupling occurs to the linear polarized \n(LP0,x) mode, ncore is the effective RI of the mode propagating in the core, nclad(x) is the \neffective RI of the LP0,x cladding mode, and \u039b is the period of the grating. \nThe attenuation of the cladding modes results in the presence of a series of resonance \nbands in the transmission spectrum of the fiber [7], as shown in Fig. 1(b), centered at \nwavelengths that satisfy Eq. (1). A portion of the electric field of the cladding mode penetrates \ninto the surrounding medium in the form of an evanescent wave and thus the effective RI of \nthe cladding mode and the \u03bb(x) of the resonance band within the optical transmission spectrum \nof the fiber will depend on physico-chemical parameters of the surrounding medium, such as \nRI, and concentration. Therefore, the central wavelength and extinction of the resonance \nbands are dependent on the period of the LPG and the thickness and refractive index of \ncoatings deposited on the surface of the cladding. \nSeveral approaches for depositing coatings of sub-\u00b5m thickness onto the surface of LPGs \nhave been examined, such as Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) [4], electrostatic self-assembly (ESA) \n[5], layer-by-layer (LbL) and dip-coating [2,3] techniques. Such surface modification has \nenabled sensitive and selective measurements, with reports of demonstrations of specific \noptical sensors for pH, humidity, and chemical and biological components [8\u201314]. The \nsensitivity of the LPG\u2019s resonance bands to changes in the optical properties of the deposited \n#126062 - $15.00 USD Received 31 Mar 2010; revised 30 Apr 2010; accepted 1 May 2010; published 4 Jun 2010\n(C) 2010 OSA 7 June 2010 \/ Vol. 18,  No. 12 \/ OPTICS EXPRESS  13228\nfilm is largest when the optical thickness of the coating (product of the physical thickness and \nrefractive index) is of the order 300 nm [8]. The thickness of individual layers deposited by \nthe LB and LbL techniques is in order of few nanometers and thus the deposition of at least \n100 layers are required, which is a time consuming process. \nLPG \ngrating Input \nspectrum\nOutput \nspectrum\n500 600 700 800 900 1000 1100 1200\n20 %\nTr\na\nn\nsm\nis\nsio\nn\n \n\/ %\n(iii)  400 \u00b5m\nWavelength \/ nm\n20 % (ii)  80 \u00b5m\n \n(i)  100 \u00b5m\n20 %\n(a)  \n(b)  \nTr\na\nn\nsm\nis\nsio\nn\n \n\/ %\n \nFig. 1.

The approach is based on the \nalternate deposition of silica nanoparticles (SiO2 NPs) with a diameter in the range of 40\u201350 \nnm, using an LbL method. This allows the rapid film deposition for the required physical \nthickness [13]. The porous nature of the SiO2 NPs coating results in a low refractive index. \nIncreases in the refractive index of the coating, for example in response to the condensation of \nwater vapor within the coating, will result in a change in the resonance wavelengths. This has \nbeen exploited to demonstrate a humidity sensor [14]. An additional advantage of the use of \nthe LbL deposition technique to form the mesoporous coating, in comparison with the \nconventional sol-gel technique, lies in the ability to easily control the thickness of the coating \nlayer by employing different diameters of SiO2 NPs. In this paper we consider the mesoporous \nSiO2 NPs coating as a base film that may then be modified to provide the coated LPG with \nspecies specific responsivity. Infusion of a functional material into the mesoporous film will \nhas two effects; the first is to induce an increase of the RI and hence the optical thickness of \nthe deposited layer, allowing the sensing of the infused material, the second is the provision of \na species specific sensing capability and optimization of the characteristics of the sensor by \ncontrol of the amount of material infused. This technique also means that the choice of \nfunctional material is not limited to those that may be deposited by the LB, LbL or dip coating \ntechniques, broadening the potential of coated LPG sensors. \n#126062 - $15.00 USD Received 31 Mar 2010; revised 30 Apr 2010; accepted 1 May 2010; published 4 Jun 2010\n(C) 2010 OSA 7 June 2010 \/ Vol. 18,  No. 12 \/ OPTICS EXPRESS  13229\n2. LPG Characteristics \nLPGs of length 30 mm and with a period of 80, 100 and 400 \u00b5m were fabricated in a single \nmode optical fiber (Fibercore SM750) with a cut-off wavelength of 670 nm. The \nphotosensitivity of the fiber was enhanced by pressurizing it in hydrogen for a period of 2 \nweeks at 150 bar at room temperature. The LPGs were fabricated in a point-by-point fashion, \nilluminating the fiber by the output from a frequency-quadrupled Nd:YAG laser, operating at \n266nm. The transmission spectrum of the optical fiber was recorded by coupling the output \nfrom a tungsten-halogen lamp into the fiber, and by analyzing the transmitted light using a \nfiber coupled CCD spectrometer. \nThe response of the resonance bands of an LPG to the deposition of a coating is \ncharacterized by a coating thickness at which a cladding mode becomes phase-matched to a \nmode of the waveguide formed by the coating [8]. Under these conditions, a mode transition \noccurs whereby the remaining cladding modes are reorganized to fill the gap left by the loss \nof the cladding mode. The mode transition is accompanied by a rapid change in the effective \nindex of the modes. This manifests itself as a regime in which the resonance bands show a \nhigh sensitivity to changes in the optical properties of the deposited film [8], and clearly for \noptimum sensor performance the coating thickness should lie within this regime. \nA recent study showed that, in addition to optimizing the coating thickness, it is possible \nto enhance the sensitivity by appropriate choice of grating period [8]. This is achieved by \nselection of the grating period such that the sensor will operate at the phase matching turning \npoint [15], which is observed when coupling to higher order cladding modes. This can be \nunderstood with reference to Fig. 2, where the phase matching curves for a number of higher \norder cladding modes are plotted. The data plotted in Fig. 2 were obtained using the LP \napproximation to calculate the dispersion of the core and cladding modes [16]. These values \nwere used in Eq. (1) to calculate the resonant coupling wavelengths for each cladding mode. \nThe curves here are provided to aid the explanation of the phenomenon, rather than to predict \nthe actual resonant wavelengths, which is compromised by as a lack of knowledge of the \nexact fiber parameters. As indicated by the dotted line in Fig. 2, the phase matching curves \nexhibit a turning point at a given period where the coupling to a single cladding mode occurs \nat two wavelengths. As the grating period changes, the dual resonance bands move in opposite \ndirections on wavelength. Similar effects can be observed from the difference (ncore-nclad) of \nthe RI of the core and cladding modes, for example, due to changes in temperature or in the \nRI of films deposited onto the cladding. It has been demonstrated theoretically and \nexperimentally that the central wavelength of the LPG resonance bands exhibits the highest \nsensitivity to external perturbations near their phase matching turning points [15]. \nBy selecting a combination of LPG period and optical thickness such that the LPG is \noperating at the phase matching turning point within the mode transition region, mode \ntransition region, it is possible to ensure optimal sensitivity [8,17], the sensitivity of the \ncentral wavelength of the dual resonance bands could be maximized by optimal choice of \nLPG properties (grating period and optical thickness of the deposited film). Initially, a single \nbroad resonance band appears in the spectrum, when the LPG couples light to the cladding \nmode at the phase matching turning point (indicated by the dashed line in Fig. 2). \nSubsequently, the amplitude of the resonance band is enhanced by the changes in nclad; \nhowever, the central wavelength is fixed and this band is split into dual resonance bands with \nfurther changes in nclad [8,16,17]. \n#126062 - $15.00 USD Received 31 Mar 2010; revised 30 Apr 2010; accepted 1 May 2010; published 4 Jun 2010\n(C) 2010 OSA 7 June 2010 \/ Vol. 18,  No. 12 \/ OPTICS EXPRESS  13230\n22\n23\n24\n25\n21\n20\n(a)\n(b)\n \nFig. 2.

Sensor fabrication \nFigure 3 shows a schematic illustration of the LbL deposition of SiO2 NPs. Firstly, the region \nof the optical fiber containing the LPG is rinsed with deionized water and immersed into 1 \nwt% ethanolic KOH (ethanol\/water = 3:2, v\/v) for 20 min, leading to a negatively charged \nsurface. The optical fiber is then sequentially immersed into an aqueous solution of positively \ncharged polymer, poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA, Mw: 200000\u2013350000, \n20% w\/w in H2O) and into an aqueous solution containing negatively charged SiO2 NPs \n(SNOWTEX 20L, Nissan chemical industries) for 20 min, so that an alternate layer of PDDA \nand SiO2 was deposited onto the fiber surface. The fiber is rinsed with distilled water, and \ndried by flushing with nitrogen gas after each deposition step.

Results and discussion \n4.1 Deposition of SiO2 NPs \nThe inset in Fig. 3 shows the cross-section of a 10-cycle PDDA\/SiO2 ((PDDA\/SiO2)10) film \ndeposited onto an optical fiber and demonstrates that a uniform and highly porous film with a \nwell-controlled thickness was deposited on the LPG. The porosity of the deposited film was \nmeasured using a Sorptomatic 1990 (Thermo Scientific) instrument operating on the static \nvolumetric principle, due to porosity characterization via gas adsorption. The pore size \ndistribution of the PDDA\/SiO2 film indicates a well developed mesoporous structure with a \nmean pore radius of 12.5 nm and specific surface area of 50 m2 g\u22121 [Figs. 4(a) and 4(b)]. In \norder to determine the thickness and RI of the PDDA\/SiO2 layer, a 1-cycle film was also \nassembled, using the same process as described for the LPG, on an activated quartz substrate \nand characterized using a SopraGES5 ellipsometer (Tarn Electronics SARL, France). The \nthickness and RI of the 1 layer-thick film were estimated to be 46 \u00b1 3 nm and 1.2000 (at a \nwavelength of 633 nm), respectively. The measured RI is in good agreement with a previously \nreported result [18]. When the coating deposited onto the quartz substrate was viewed under \nthe SEM and compared with the coating deposited on the LPG, there were no apparent \ndifferences in the morphology. \n#126062 - $15.00 USD Received 31 Mar 2010; revised 30 Apr 2010; accepted 1 May 2010; published 4 Jun 2010\n(C) 2010 OSA 7 June 2010 \/ Vol. 18,  No. 12 \/ OPTICS EXPRESS  13232\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n \n \n \n \nV a\n\/c\nm\n3 (S\nTP\n) g\n-\n1\np\/p0\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\nVp= 0.3039 [cm\n3\n g-1]\nrp peak(Area)=12.24 [nm]\nsurface area = 50.901 [m2 g-1]\nrp\/nm\n \n \ndV\np\/d\n(r p\n)\n12.24nm\n14 nm\n(a) (b)\n  \nV a\n\/c\nm\n3 (S\nTP\n) g\n-\n1\n \ndV\np\/d\n(r p\n)\n \nFig. 4.

(b) Wavelength shifts at 798 nm. \nOn the other hand, the 100 \u00b5m period LPG has an additional resonance band centered at \n800 nm. The development of the resonance band at around 800 nm, corresponding to the \ncoupling to the LP0,21 mode, is a result of the change in the nclad induced by the presence of the \ndeposited layer, which makes coupling to this cladding mode at the phase matching turning \npoint possible. Before film deposition, there is no band in the wavelength range at around 800 \nnm. As the number of the deposition cycles increases, the resonance band becomes more \npronounced. However, because of the low RI (ca. 1.200) of the deposited SiO2 NP layer, this \nresonance feature is not well developed for this film thickness. As previous studies have \nindicated the benefits of operating at the phase matching turning point [8,17], the \ndemonstration of the sensing principles of the LPGs coated with mesoporous films infused \nwith functional materials were carried out using the 100 \u00b5m period LPG. \n4.2 Effect of the coating on the LPG transmission spectrum \nWhen the uncoated 100 \u00b5m period LPG was immersed into water (RI = 1.323), a blue shift of \nthe LP0,20 resonance band of 3 nm is observed. However, the sensitivity of the LP0,20 \nresonance band was much improved by the coating with a (PDDA\/SiO2)10 film, showing a \nblue shift of 7 nm when the LPG was immersed in water, along with the appearance of the \nresonance band corresponding to coupling to the LP0,21 cladding mode at the phase matching \nturning point [Fig. 8(a)]. This indicates an increase in sensitivity of the LPG to the \nsurrounding RI, being of interest when measuring the RI of low concentration aqueous \n#126062 - $15.00 USD Received 31 Mar 2010; revised 30 Apr 2010; accepted 1 May 2010; published 4 Jun 2010\n(C) 2010 OSA 7 June 2010 \/ Vol. 18,  No. 12 \/ OPTICS EXPRESS  13234\nsolutions, and has been observed previously for LPGs coated using the LB technique [19]. \nThe response to the RI changes is fast (< 2 s, measurement limited by the integration time for \nthe CCD spectrometer) and stable, as indicated by the response of the transmitted power at the \ncentre of the LP0,21 resonance band to repeated immersions in water [Fig. 8(b)]. \n600 650 700 750 800 850 900\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n110\n632 634 636 638 640 642 644 646 648\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n3\n1\n \n \n \n3\n2\n1\nTr\nan\nsm\nis\nsio\nn\n \n\/ %\nWavelength \/ nm\n2\n \n \n \n0 100 200 300 400 500 600\n80\n85\n90\n95\n100\n105\nH\n2\nO-3H2O-2\nTime \/ s\n \n \nTr\nan\nsm\nis\nsi\non\n \n\/ %\nH\n2\nO-1\nair\n(a) (b)\n  \nTr\nan\nsm\nis\nsio\nn\n \n\/ %\n  \n \nTr\nan\nsm\nis\nsi\non\n \n\/ %\n \nFig. 8.

(b) Kinetic changes of the transmission spectrum of the \nSiO2 NP coated LPG fiber measured at 800 nm in different phases from air to water. \n4.3 Chemical infusion into the mesoporous SiO2 NP film \nThe resonance bands (LP0,20 and LP0,21) could be used for the detection of chemical \ncomponents that can be bound through an electrostatic interaction with the cationic groups of \nPDDA in the mesopores of the film. Figure 9(a) shows the transmission spectra recorded \nwhen the (PDDA\/SiO2)10 film coated LPG was immersed in a solution of tetrakis-(4-\nsulfophenyl)porphine (TSPP, 1 mM in water). As the TSPP is infused into the film, the RI of \nthe film increases (from 1.200 to ca. 1.540, measured using ellipsometry) and the phase \nmatching condition for coupling to LP0,21 is satisfied. A broad single attenuation band \ndevelops rapidly (within 60 s from the start of the infusion process) and then splits in two \nbands. This is consistent with previous observations of the response of the LPG resonance \nbands to increases in coating thickness at constant RI, but here is seen for changes in \nrefractive index at constant thickness. The time required to complete the binding between the \nTSPP and PDDA moieties is less than 600 s [Fig. 9(b)]. It should be noted that transmission \nspectra in Fig. 9(a) corresponds to the time elapsed from the start of the TSPP infusion \nprocess rather than from the time at which the monitoring of the spectrum commenced. The \nobserved response indicates a large increase in the optical thickness of the film, which is a \nresult of the increase in the RI of the film that occurs, as the TSPP infuses into the \nmesoporous structure and is adsorbed to the PDDA moiety between the SiO2 NPs. \nThe evolution of the transmission spectrum of the SiO2 NPs coated LPG when immersed \nin the TSPP solution is shown in the grey scale plot shown in Fig. 10, where the transmission \nis represented by white and black, corresponding to 100% and 0%, respectively. The dark line \nat around 635 nm, which originates at a wavelength of 640 nm in the uncoated LPG, \nrepresents the resonance band that corresponds to the first order coupling to the LP0,20 \ncladding mode. \n#126062 - $15.00 USD Received 31 Mar 2010; revised 30 Apr 2010; accepted 1 May 2010; published 4 Jun 2010\n(C) 2010 OSA 7 June 2010 \/ Vol. 18,  No. 12 \/ OPTICS EXPRESS  13235\n 700 750 800 850 900\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n110\n(v)\n(iv)\n(iii)\n(ii)\n(i) water\nTSPP infusion\n(ii) at 50 sec\n(iii) at 250 sec\n(iv) at 60 min\n(v) air after TSPP infusion\nLP0,21\n \n \n \nTr\na\nn\nsm\nisi\nso\nn\n \n\/ %\nWavelength \/ nm\n(i)\n0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n110\nTr\nan\nsm\nisi\nso\nn\n \n\/ %\n 800 nm\n \nTime \/ s\n(a) (b)\n  \nTr\na\nn\nsm\nisi\nso\nn\n \n\/ %\nTr\nan\nsm\nisi\nso\nn\n \n\/ %\n \n \nFig. 9.

The evolution of the transmission spectrum of the SiO2 NP coated LPG (period 100 \n\u00b5m), when immersed in an aqueous solution of TSPP (1 mM). The grey scale represents the \nmeasured transmission, with white corresponding to 100%, and black to 0%. \nIn order to assess the sensitivity of the optical device, the (PDDA\/SiO2)10 coated LPG was \nexposed to different concentrations of TSPP, and the results are shown in Figs. 11(a) and \n11(b). The increase of the TSPP concentration from 10 to 1000 \u00b5M results in a decrease of the \ntransmission measured at 800 nm, corresponding to the development of the LP0,21 cladding \nmode resonance. This is also accompanied by a blue shift of the LP0,20 resonance band, \nindicating the increase of the RI of the film. The response time of the sensor is observed to be \nslower at lower TSPP concentrations. For 1 mM TSPP, the increase in transmission at 800 nm \nshown in Fig. 11(b) is attributed to the splitting of the fully developed LP0,21 cladding mode \nresonance into dual resonance bands. Additionally, the infusion process can be observed in the \nmultimedia file (Media 1). \nThe ability to reuse the device was tested by removing the infused TSPP molecules from \nthe film using an ammonia solution (ca. 1000 ppm). The spectrum reverted to that observed \nfor the (PDDA\/SiO2)10 coated LPG before TSPP infusion. Subsequent immersion of the \n(PDDA\/SiO2)10 LPG into the TSPP solutions showed that the performance was repeatable, as \nshown in Fig. 11(c). Note that this could also be used as a means for detecting ammonia, with \nthe TSPP acting as the functional material. \n#126062 - $15.00 USD Received 31 Mar 2010; revised 30 Apr 2010; accepted 1 May 2010; published 4 Jun 2010\n(C) 2010 OSA 7 June 2010 \/ Vol. 18,  No. 12 \/ OPTICS EXPRESS  13236\n0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000\n800\n1000\n1200\n1400\n1600\n1800\n2000\n2200\n2400\n2600\nTSPP-1 mM\nTSPP-0.5 mM\nTSPP-100 \u00b5M\n \n \nIn\nte\nn\nsi\nty\n \n\/ m\nV\nTime \/ sec\nH\n2\nO\nTSPP-10 \u00b5M\n(a) (b)\n650 700 750 800 850 900\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n110\n \n \nTr\nan\nsm\niss\nio\nn\n \n\/ %\nWavelength \/ nm\n H\n2\nO\nTSPP-10\u00b5M\n TSPP-100\u00b5M\n TSPP-500\u00b5M\n TSPP-1mM\n0 200 400 600 800 1000\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n110\n TSPP Infusion -1\n TSPP Infusion -2\n TSPP Infusion -3\n Time \/ sec\n \n \nTr\nan\nsm\niss\nio\nn\n \n\/ %\n(c)\n \nIn\nte\nn\nsi\nty\n \n\/ m\nV\n \nTr\nan\nsm\niss\nio\nn\n \n\/ %\n \nTr\nan\nsm\niss\nio\nn\n \n\/ %\n \nFig. 11.

Conclusions \nTo date there have been a number of reports of chemical sensing based upon thin film \ncoatings deposited onto LPGs. The approach adopted here, where mesoporous films were \nbuilt from SiO2 NPs, allows more rapid deposition of a base coating of required physical \nthickness. The mesoporous films were subsequently used for chemical adsorption, either of \nmaterials to be sensed, or of functional materials to facilitate sensing, potentially extending \nthe functionality of this class of sensor. The results demonstrate the ability to use this \napproach to obtain quantitative measurements for the detection of organic compounds that can \nbe infused into the porous film and that change the RI of the film. There is the potential for \nhighly selective measurements by choosing the appropriate functional compound for infusion \ninto the porous film preparation to interact specifically with the chemical analyte. The porous \nnature of the film may also allow the development of sensors with more rapid response time, \nand the analyte may penetrate deeper into the coating, even for small concentrations. The \napproach also offers different approach to providing optimal sensitivity, whereby to ensure \nthat the LPG sensor operates with optimal sensitivity, i.e. at the phase matching turning point, \nthe LPG period and the infusion time and concentration of the functional material may be \ncontrolled. This effect will be further explored for optical sensing of a variety of important \nchemical and biological compounds. \nThe TSPP compound used in this work is able to function as a sensitive element because \nof its extraordinary optical properties. In general, optical properties of porphyrins can be \nvaried by metallation of the pyrrole ring, which in turn will lead to a higher sensitivity and \nselectivity to a wider class of chemical compounds [20].
