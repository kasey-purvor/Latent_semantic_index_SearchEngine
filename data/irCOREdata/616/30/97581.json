SAAVEDRA and \nJIM TATE \n \n \nSUMMARY: Excavations were undertaken of a ruined building at Aguas Buenas, \nidentified as an 18th-century Spanish gunpowder magazine. Evidence was also found \nfor the camp site of an early European occupant of the island. A case is made that this \nwas Alexander Selkirk, a castaway here from 1704 to 1709. Selkirk was the model for \nDefoe\u2019s Robinson Crusoe. A detailed discussion is given of a fragment of copper alloy \nidentified as being from a pair of navigational dividers. \n \n \nBACKGROUND \n \nThe main aim of the project from the beginning was to identify evidence for the \nactivities of the Scottish sailor, Alexander Selkirk, marooned on the island from 1704 \nto 1709, or at least other early castaways. Selkirk is presumed to be the model for \nDaniel Defoe\u2019s hero in the novel first published in 1719, The Life And Strange \n 1\nSurprizing Adventure of Robinson Crusoe, Of York, Mariner. The novel is not by any \nmeans an exact account of Selkirk\u2019s adventure, nor is there clear evidence that Defoe \nand Selkirk actually met, though Defoe must have been well aware of Selkirk\u2019s \nadventure.1 \n     Daisuke Takahashi had spent some time exploring the island in 1994-95 in the \nhope of identifying Selkirk\u2019s campsite. In 2001 he was shown the overgrown traces of \na building at Aguas Buenas by an elderly islander. The latter had discovered these in \n1955 and they had remained unknown and unvisited ever since. Takahashi realised \nthat the location corresponded well with his views on where Selkirk\u2019s campsite might \nbe located and believed that the ruins were worthy of further examination.2 With \nsponsorship from the National Geographic Society, Washington DC, USA, \nexcavations were undertaken in early 2005. \n \n \nROBINSON CRUSOE ISLAND \n \nThis island lies about S 33\u00b0 38\u2019, W 78\u00b0 50\u2019 in the South Pacific, over 400 miles west \nof Valpara\u00edso (Fig.1). It is one of three islands, volcanic in origin, in the Juan \nFernandez Archipelago, and the only one that is permanently inhabited, with a \npopulation of about 500. It used to be known as Mas-a-Tierra but was renamed \nRobinson Crusoe Island to commemorate the stay of Alexander Selkirk.  Confusingly, \nthe other main island in the group, Mas Afuera, some 90 miles to the west, has been \nrenamed Alexander Selkirk Island, even though Selkirk never set foot there. The third \nisland, Santa Clara Island, is only about one mile by two miles and lies close to the \nwest end of Robinson Crusoe Island. There is no historical or archaeological evidence \n 2\nfor human occupation on any of the islands prior to their discovery by Europeans in \nthe late 16th century. \n     Robinson Crusoe Island (Isla Robinson Crusoe) has an area of about 58 square \nmiles, a length east to west of about 14 miles and is under 5 miles in maximum width \nfrom north to south. It is mostly mountainous, rising to a height of 915m, and much of \nthe coastline consists of cliffs. The only reasonably accessible point for ships is \nCumberland Bay (Bah\u00eda Cumberland) to the north-east and here is the only \nsettlement, San Juan Bautista. The climate is mild all year round and there is an \nabundance of water. There is a unique native flora, largely consisting of evergreen \nrain forest that has been under attack from axes and introduced species since the \ncoming of man.3 Native seals and humming birds are much in evidence, and human \ninhabitants have traditionally harvested the supplies of fish and lobsters around the \ncoasts. Of introduced species the most notable are the goats left by the Spanish in the \nlate 16th century and now largely kept under control. Most of the island is now a \nnational park administered by CONAF (Corporaci\u00f3n Nacional Forestal). \n     The ancestors of the present population only came to the island in the middle of the \n19th century. Before that there were various unsuccessful attempts at colonisation, and \nthe establishment of a fort by the Spanish in 1750 with a view to curtailing the \nactivities of European pirates and privateers. The island was unoccupied when \nAlexander Selkirk arrived there in 1704.4 At that time it was owned along with the \ntwo other islands of the Juan Fernandez Archipelago by the Jesuits, having been \ngifted to them in 1667 by Juan Fernandez, a descendant of the original discoverer. \nThey remained in the possession of the Jesuits until 1767 when they were expelled \nfrom Chile. They are said to have re-introduced goats to Robinson Crusoe Island in \n1667 but there is no evidence that they established a base there or had it settled.5 \n 3\n     Prior to this project only a limited amount of archaeological investigation had been \nundertaken on the island. This included some work in Puerto Ingl\u00e9s in 1999 by \nC\u00e1ceres and Saavedra with excavations inside and in front of Robinson Crusoe\u2019s \nCave. They found no convincing evidence of human occupation in this area prior to \nthe establishment of a Spanish gun battery in the middle of the 18th century.6 Other \nwork on sites at La Vaquer\u00eda, Puerto Ingl\u00e9s, Cumberland Bay and Puerto Franc\u00e9s \nreported by Anderson et al. has also failed to identify remains which are likely to pre-\ndate the mid18th-century.7 Environmental analysis of a sediment core taken on \nAlexander Selkirk Island has traced the impact on the local vegetation since the late \n16th century of the introduction of goats, the burning of forests and the spread of \nintroduced species. This charts a situation that must have been similar to \ndevelopments on Robinson Crusoe Island.8 \n \n \nALEXANDER SELKIRK \n \nAlexander Selkirk was born in the small seaside town of Lower Largo, Fife, Scotland \nin 1676, a younger son of a shoemaker.9 Members of the Selkirk, or Selcraig, family \nfeature several times in the Kirk Session Records of Largo in the years from 1693 to \n1703 for fighting and drunkenness. In 1701 there was a serious scuffle in the family \nthat involved Alexander assaulting his father and two of his brothers. His mother even \nexpressed a desire to be separated from her husband.10 Alexander was clearly a man \nwith a temper, not happy with small town ways. He was drawn to a life at sea where \nhe spent much of his time, finally dying aboard HMS Weymouth off Cape Coast, \nGhana, on 13 December 1721. \n 4\n     He apparently first went to sea in August 1693 to avoid the wrath of the Kirk \nsession `for indecent carriage\u2019.11 Where is not clear. A modern author suggests, but \nwith no supporting evidence, that he might have taken part in Scotland\u2019s disastrous \nattempt to establish a colony on the Panama isthmus, the ill-fated Darien scheme.12 \nThere is, however, a clue contained in a 19th-century inventory of jewellery, etc at \nDrummond Castle in Perthshire:  \n `an inkholder said to have belonged to daughter of the Sophy of Persia,  \n captured on her way to be married to the Grand Mogul by a pirate in a  \n ship also containing Robinson Crusoe, to whom she gave it and he  \n gave it to Robert Lundin of that ilk\u2019.13 \nThis refers to one of the most famous piratical adventures of all time when a group of \nEnglish ships led by Henry Avery attacked and captured the Ganj-i-Sawai, a treasure \nship belonging to the Moghal emperor of India in the mouth of the Red Sea on 8 \nSeptember 1695.14 The inkwell to which the tradition was attached by the 19th \ncentury was of later date but this does not necessarily invalidate the memory that there \nwas such a gift. \n     The Selkirk family squabble in November 1701 is the only evidence for \nAlexander\u2019s return home, and it is not known how soon after this he was off to sea \nagain. Certainly he sailed on the Cinque Ports in  September 1703, one of two ships \nbound on a privateering voyage into the Pacific Ocean. The other ship was the St \nGeorge under the command of William Dampier, the overall leader of the expedition. \nDampier was then well known for his book A New Voyage Round the World, first \npublished in 1697, recounting some of his previous experiences. Selkirk later claimed \nthat he was master of the Cinque Ports, under the overall command of Captain \nCharles Pickering. As master Selkirk would have had the responsibility for navigating \n 5\nthe vessel, but a study a number of years ago by Lee of depositions made by Selkirk \nin 1712 for the trial of William Dampier suggests this was not strictly true. Lee \nbelieved it possible that Selkirk was recruited as a foremastman and he was \nencouraged to talk his role up as part of a process of casting doubt on Dampier\u2019s \nabilities. Lee is also sceptical as to whether a ship like the Cinque Ports would have \nhad a master, this role belonging ex officio to the captain.15 An account of the \nexpedition, however, by William Funnell, one of the officers on the St George, \ndescribes how he, on behalf of Captain Dampier and the master of the Cinque Ports \non behalf of Captain Stradling, were put in charge of a prize in May 1704. This master \nof the Cinque Ports was surely Selkirk.16 \n     Whatever the case, the fact that Selkirk had significant interest in navigating, and \nability in that field, cannot be doubted since his navigational instruments were \namongst his prized possessions, and after his rescue he was appointed master of the \nSpanish prize the Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Encarnaci\u00f3n which was sailed all the way \nback to England.17 Selkirk\u2019s role as a navigator is of some significance as we shall \nshow below. \n     If Selkirk was indeed master of the Cinque Ports, her captain Charles Pickering \nmust have had evidence of, or previous knowledge of Selkirk\u2019s ability. There is one \nother piece of circumstantial evidence that is worth recounting in this respect and that \nis to do with Selkirk\u2019s sea-chest, now in the collections of the National Museums of \nScotland. The chest is a fine example of a `Spanish chest\u2019 (cassa di Spagna) from the \nMarchesato di Finale in Liguria, Italy.18 The significance of this is that Pickering, as \ncaptain of a ship named the Charles, had been operating as a privateer out of Livorno, \nalso in north-west Italy, prior to sailing for the Pacific. \n 6\n     In July 1696 Pickering had captured a rich French prize called the Madona di \nCarmina but the French brought pressure to bear on the Grand Duke of Tuscany so \nthat one of the owners of the Charles, William Plowman, was imprisoned in Florence \nand the goods that had been seized were returned to the French. By April 1703 \nPickering, now apparently no longer captain of the Charles, was suspected by the \nEnglish authorities of selling goods under Swedish colours to the French in \nMarseilles. Perhaps things had by that summer got so hot for him in the \nMediterranean that he had no choice but to seek opportunities in some other part of \nthe world.19  \n     It is possible that Selkirk\u2019s association with Pickering went back further than 1703. \nPerhaps it was Pickering that had Selkirk promoted to master for the voyage in \nSeptember 1703. Pickering died on the passage out and was succeeded as commander \nof the Cinque Ports by Thomas Stradling, a man not popular with many of the crew, \nincluding Selkirk. The two ships made for Robinson Crusoe Island, reaching it in the \nmiddle of February 1704. Dampier had visited the island on a previous voyage and \nknew it was a good place for them to replenish their supplies with fresh food, wood \nand water and rest their crews in comparative safety before getting down to the \nserious business of attacking Spanish shipping and settlements. \n     The expedition did not prove very successful, and since Dampier and Stradling \ncould not agree on a course of action, the two ships parted company, the Cinque Ports \nreturning to Robinson Crusoe Island in September in the hope of picking up supplies \nabandoned the previous March. These had in the meantime been lifted by a French \nexpedition but two of their own sailors left behind by accident rejoined the ship, \ngiving an immediate demonstration that it was possible to live a reasonable life there \n 7\nwith limited resources. The ship, which was badly affected by marine worms, was \noverhauled. \n     Relations between Selkirk and Stradling now completely broke down, partly \nbecause Stradling had effectively demoted Selkirk.20 Selkirk also doubted \u2013 rightly \u2013 \nthat the Cinque Ports was sound enough to survive a long ocean voyage. He therefore \ndecided to stay behind on the island by himself when the Cinque Ports set sail. He \npossibly reckoned that he would be there by himself for only a few months at most \nbefore another privateer or friendly ship came along.21 In fact Selkirk was to be alone \non the island until February 1709 when another privateering expedition from England, \nthis time under the command of Captain Woodes Rogers, visited the island. Woodes \nRogers\u2019 account of his voyage is one of the main sources of information on Selkirk\u2019s \nstay. He describes how he had with him his clothes and bedding, a gun with some \ngunpowder and bullets, tobacco, a hatchet, a knife, a kettle, a Bible, `some practical \npieces\u2019, and his mathematical instruments and books.22  \n     In December 1713 the English writer Richard Steele published a brief essay on \nSelkirk which contains similar information to that given by Rogers and which may, \nindeed, be largely derived from Rogers\u2019 account. We should nevertheless believe \nSteele\u2019s statement that he met him on several occasions. Steele lists Selkirk\u2019s \npossessions when he was abandoned on the island as a sea-chest, his wearing clothes \nand bedding, a gun, a pound of gunpowder, a large quantity of bullets, a flint and \nsteel, a few pounds of tobacco, a hatchet, a knife, a kettle, a Bible, and other books of \ndevotion; together with pieces that concerned navigation, and his navigational \ninstruments.23 \n     According to Rogers it took Selkirk eight months to get over his fear and \ndepression but eventually he settled down to lead a reasonably happy life, reading his \n 8\nBible and becoming a better Christian than ever before (or indeed later) in his life. He \nbuilt two huts, one for use as a kitchen, the other as a dwelling. They were constructed \nwith `piemento\u2019 trees, covered with long grass and lined with goatskins. Which of the \nnative species were `piemento\u2019 trees is by no means certain, but on the basis that \nSelkirk also used their fruits as a substitute for pepper, they may be identified as \nnaranjillo (Fagara mayu (Bertero ex Colla) Engler). Steele only mentions one hut and \nsays that it was beside a substantial wood. \n     He found plenty to eat, especially goats which he first shot and eventually learnt to \noutrun. There were lobsters (crayfish) and fish in abundance, though he was not keen \non the latter, and also turnips planted by previous visitors and the leaves of the \n`cabbage trees\u2019 (Dendroseris litoralis Skottsb.). During his stay on the island several \nships passed by but only two came into anchor. They were Spanish and Selkirk was \nlucky to escape capture. By the time he was picked up by Woodes Rogers\u2019 expedition \nhe was clad in goatskins and had difficulty stringing together sentences.24 \n     There is no precise description in Roger\u2019s book of where exactly Selkirk lived, but \nit must have been fairly accessible from Cumberland Bay on the north side of the \nisland, then and now the only reasonably sheltered point where ships could anchor in \nsafety for any length of time. Rogers provides the circumstantial information that \nSelkirk lived in the mountains, and he could apparently see from there to the south \nend of the island which was `plainer\u2019 \u2013 that is not covered with forest. There were \nmany goats there but he could not get to them because the way down was so steep and \nrocky. Selkirk had probably also been able to see the ships approaching from west-\nsouth-west and heading up past the east end of the island at a distance of 12 or more \nmiles. In any case he was well prepared to light a fire down by the water\u2019s edge to \n 9\nattract the attention of the expedition\u2019s pinnance as it approached on the evening of 31 \nJanuary.25  \n     All this suggests that Selkirk must have based himself near a hollow in the ridge of \nmountains that forms the backbone of the island (Fig.2). This spot is identified as \nSelkirk\u2019s lookout on a plaque erected there by the officers of a British Navy ship, the \nHMS Topaze, in 1868. There is evidence of an old path that climbed to this spot from \nCumberland Bay (Fig.3). There are at least three large boulders on its route which are \ncut with inscriptions, including the name Pedro Arredondo, identified as the ancestor \nof some present day islanders, and the date 1866, showing that the path was there by \nthe time of the Topaze\u2019s visit. Selkirk\u2019s lookout appears to be the only reasonably \naccessible point from which it is possible to see down over Cumberland Bay and also \nsouth-westwards over the sea in the direction from which other ships might come to \nthe rescue. \n     Nowadays there is a modern path which zigzags from the Lookout (El Mirador) \ndown through a steep, narrow, wooded valley known as Villagra and from there to the \nairstrip at the west end of the island. Without the path Selkirk may have found it too \ndifficult to get beyond the Lookout. He would, however, have been able to see a \nconsiderable stretch of the west end of the island, then as now probably largely \nunforested. An English map of the island made in 1681 is orientated as if the west end \nis to the south and marks it as the `Goat Quarters\u2019.26 Selkirk would certainly have \nbeen able to see goats from the Lookout away in the distance beyond Villagra. \n     All this suggests that Selkirk was largely confined to the hinterland of Cumberland \nBay. He may not even have found it practical to get over the mountain ridge into \nPuerto Ingl\u00e9s where `Robinson Crusoe\u2019s Cave\u2019 is traditionally said to have been used \nby him. The site at Aguas Buenas is on the old path to the Lookout (Fig. 3). \n 10\n     Using early sources and basic observations on the placing of human settlements, \nTakahashi had come up with the following list of criteria for the probable location of \nSelkirk\u2019s campsite:  \n1. proximity to fresh water \n2. readily available food \n3. level ground \n4. shelter from sun and rain \n5. access to a viewpoint to look for ships approaching from the north and \nthe south. \n     The site at Aguas Buenas (Fig.4) is adjacent to a good supply of freshwater \u2013 a \nvigorous stream that tumbles down the valley to the sea in Cumberland Bay. The \nsurrounding forest still provides many things to eat and in Selkirk\u2019s day was probably \nfull of goats. There was enough level ground to erect one or two huts and the spot was \nreasonably sheltered.  Some naranjillo trees still grow in the area. There is a good \nview over Cumberland Bay and the Lookout could be readily reached, perhaps in less \nthan thirty minutes by a fit man. The trip down to the shore at Cumberland Bay need \nhave taken no longer, but Selkirk seems, in any case, to have been less interested in \nutilising maritime food resources. \n     For all these reasons Aguas Buenas seemed a good place to look for traces of \nSelkirk\u2019s stay on the island, although it was clear from the start of the archaeological \nwork that the chances of finding such evidence were very limited. \n \n \nAGUAS BUENAS \n \n 11\nThe site at Aguas Buenas is in endemic forest. Its GPS location is 33\u00b038\u2019 19.1\u201d S by \n78\u00b0 50\u2019 47.1\u201d W at a height of 274m above sea level. It consists of a piece of ground \nabout 12m E-W by 7m N-S terraced into a gentle slope. It appears that there was a \nsmall piece of level ground here the size of which has been increased by the removal \nof a large mass of soil, estimated to be as much as 150 tons. Around the south and \nwest ends can be seen the quarry face left by the workers when they finished the job \n(Fig. 5). To north, south and west a ridge of mountains, including the Lookout, forms \nthe horizon. To the east the ground slopes down gently revealing a view over \nCumberland Bay. The ground slopes away more steeply westwards and southwards to \na stream, a tributary of the river that flows into the sea in the village of San Juan \nBautista. The trees are less dense at the site than in the surrounding forest, with an \nabsence of mature specimens, suggesting the presence of a clearing in the past. At the \neast end of the level ground, prior to excavation, the ruins of a rectangular building \ncould be seen, about 7.5m E-W by 5m N-S, the walls apparently of stone and standing \nlittle more than 0.5m high (Fig. 6).  \n \n \nTHE ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION \n \nFieldwork was undertaken in January and February 2005 by Takahashi, Caldwell, \nC\u00e1ceres, Calder\u00f3n and Saavedra. With permission from CONAF and the National \nMonuments Council (Consejo de Monumentos Nacionales (CMN)) the site was first \nof all cleared of non-endemic vegetation. This still left a significant number of trees \nand saplings, mostly luma (Myrceugenia fernandeziana (Hook. & Arn.) Johow), in \nand about the ruined building. Fieldwork was divided into two stages. Firstly, from 13 \n 12\nto 18 January initial planning was done of the site and small trenches (1 to 5) \nexcavated outside the building to test for archaeological deposits and as a guide to \nwhere to place the main trenches. From 26 January to 10 February excavations \n(trenches 6 to 12) were undertaken within the building and the area immediately \nadjacent to it. \n     Surveying and planning were undertaken with a limited range of equipment \u2013 a 5m \nand a 30m tape, a line level, string and two ranging rods. Planning was achieved by \ntriangulation, using trees as fixed points. Levels were all related to a site bench-mark \nassigned a value of 274m above sea level. Cross-checking would indicate an accuracy \nfor levels of \u00b1100mm or better. \n     An initial survey of the whole area including the building was made with a metal \ndetector, and \u2018hits\u2019 marked, but not excavated. It was hoped that this might provide \nsome useful clues as to where to locate trenches. In the event, trench 3 was laid out \npartially to check a group of hits but it is probable that the machine readings were of a \ngeological nature. \n     All deposits excavated in trenches 1 to 8 were sieved and all artefacts, including \nfragments of tile and brick, retained. The deposits in trenches 9 to 12 were sieved \nmore selectively and only representative pieces of tile and brick kept. Soil samples \nwere taken from occupation deposits and features for possible dating and \narchaeobotanic analyses. \n     All contexts \u2013 deposits, walls, post-holes, etc \u2013 have been given a four or five digit \ncontext number, the first one or two digits being the number of the trench in which the \ncontext was encountered. For this report, contexts which demonstrably stretch through \nmore than one trench are generally referred to by a unique context number. A Munsell \nSoil Colour Chart was used for describing the colour of deposits. \n 13\n  \nSTAGE 1 \n \nTRENCH 1 \n \nA sondage, half a metre square, excavated at the west end of the site (Figs 5 and 7), \nexposed a thin layer of topsoil [1001] overlying natural clay [1003]. There is a cut in \nthe natural, back-filled with silty clay [1002]. This is interpreted as the result of \nquarrying to create the level area of the yard and to provide clay for the construction \nof the building. The natural here and elsewhere on the site consists of clay with some \nsilt and small angular stones, varying in colour from dark yellowish brown (10YR \n3\/4) to dark brown (10YR 3\/3). \n \n \nTRENCH 2 \n \nA sondage, half a metre square, positioned near the south-west corner of the building, \nexposed a more complex sequence of deposits than was evident in trench 1 (Figs 5 \nand 7). There is a relatively new layer of topsoil [2001] overlying a thick deposit of \nsandy silt [2002-2003], perhaps material washed from the wall of the building. Under \nthat is an earlier ground horizon [2004] on top of natural [2005]. \n \n \nTRENCH 3 \n 14\n This trench was located towards the west end of the site and was about 1m by 2m, \norientated approximately N-S (Figs 5 and 7). A thin layer of topsoil [3001] covers a \nsubsoil deposit [3002] containing fragments of roof tile from the ruin of the building. \nIt overlies natural clay [3004] with crumbly rock [3003]. This appears to be a natural \nsoil profile developing after the abandonment of the building. \n \n \nTRENCH 4 \n \nA metre square sondage was excavated down slope of the east end of the building in \nthe hope that debris from the building or other occupation deposits might be \nrecovered (Figs 5 and 7). The deposits consist solely of topsoil [4001], subsoil [4002] \nand natural clay [4003], with a few fragments of tile and brick in 4001 and 4002. \n \n \nTRENCH 5 \n \nAnother metre square sondage to the east of the building but closer to it than trench 4 \n(Figs 5 and 7) produced an identical sequence of deposits: topsoil [5001], subsoil \n[5002] and natural clay [5003]. There are fragments of tile and brick in 5001 and \n5002. \n \n Excavation of these trenches provided little clue to the function of the building. The \nceramic material from the trenches and recovered as surface finds \u2013 roof tiles, bricks \n 15\nand pottery \u2013 tended to suggest a date in the 18th or 19th century, almost certainly all \nlater than Selkirk\u2019s stay on the island. It also seemed reasonable to conclude that the \nlevelling of the site, perhaps to create a yard, was likely to be associated with the use \nof the building. It would have removed any earlier traces of occupation. It was \ntherefore decided in stage 2 to concentrate attention on the building itself with the \nintention of explaining its purpose and date, and hopefully uncovering earlier \noccupation deposits preserved underneath it. \n \n \nSTAGE 2 \n \nTRENCHES 6 & 7 \n \nTrench 6, 1m by 2m, was laid out in the south-west corner of the building (Figs 8 and \n9). Its excavation demonstrated that there is a metre or more of debris, earth and \nstones [6001-6004] from the collapse or destruction of the building (Figs 10 and 11). \nThe walls of the building are of clay, faced inside and out with stone, mostly `field \nstones\u2019, undressed, locally gathered and of a size and weight that could readily be \nhandled by individual men (Figs 7 and 12). The walls are about 1m thick and survive \nto a height of over 1m above the level of the floor internally. No actual floor surface \nwas found but only the upper surface of the natural clay [6007], scarped to form a \nlevel surface for a floor. A small sondage was dug into 6007 for a depth of about 0.5m \nrevealing that the natural here was mottled rather than flecked with small stones. \nNeatly sectioned by the east baulk of the trench was a shallow, circular, basin-shaped \n 16\npit [6006] containing a deposit [6005] of dark brown silt with many small pieces of \ncharcoal (Fig. 13). \n     Trench 7, contiguous with the east side of trench 6 and with an area of 2m by 1m, \nwas opened, thus exposing the whole area of feature 6006 (Figs 8 and 9). It is 0.7m by \n0.8m with a depth of up to 0.2m. It is interpreted as a hearth of earlier date than the \nbuilding, the upper part of it, and the associated living surface, having been removed \nduring the levelling for the floor of the building. \n \n \nTRENCHES 8 & 9 \n \nThe next trench to be opened was trench 8, 2m E-W, and extending the full width of \nthe building (Fig. 8). It was placed over what was supposed to be the position of the \neast wall and entrance into the building. This turned out to be the case. The entrance is \nlocated centrally in the east wall, is slightly over 1m wide, splaying internally to a \nwidth of 1.8m. The original floor surface survives in the entrance as rough paving, \nextending eastwards beyond the entrance into the area of a porch formed by two \nflanking buttresses, the 1m long extensions to the building\u2019s north and south walls. \nThere is a clear break in the paving, probably a slot [8006] for the timber of the \ndoorway, 0.25m wide, running the full width of the threshold. It was not excavated \n(Fig. 14). \n     Trench 8 was extended westwards into the interior of the building as trench 9, with \nan E-W width of 1m (Fig. 8). This demonstrated that the paving in the entranceway \ndoes not continue beyond the thickness of the east wall. The floor level in the interior \nwas clearly at a higher level, at least 0.01m higher, and about 0.02m if the floor was \n 17\npaved with the bricks of which many fragments were found in the debris within the \nruins. Only a few bricks were actually recovered lying flat on the make-up level for \nthe floor. Although the evidence for a brick floor is not overwhelming there is no \nother obvious explanation for the quantities recovered from the excavations. \n     The paving in the entrance was left in place, but excavation below the floor level \nin trench 9 revealed further evidence of earlier occupation of the site (Figs 15 and 16). \nOnly half exposed, since the rest of it is stratified under the paving, is a hearth [8016] \nwith a complex sequence of deposits of ash, charcoal and small fragments of burnt \nbone (Figs 17 and 18), from top to bottom as follows: \n 8010: ash and charcoal, yellowish brown in colour (10YR 5\/8) with small  \n  fragments of burnt bone, maximum thickness 50mm.  \n 8011: powdered, black charcoal (10YR 2\/1), maximum thickness  \n  10mm. \n 8012: ash and charcoal, dark red in colour (2.5YR 3\/6), maximum  \n  thickness 40mm. \n 8013: powdered charcoal and ash, black in colour (10YR 2\/1),  \n  maximum thickness 35mm. \n 8014: powdered ash, dark reddish brown in colour (5YR 3\/3),  \n  maximum thickness 30mm. \nLike hearth 6006, 8016 appears to be a shallow, basin-shaped hollow. It has a \ndiameter of about 1.1m and it is possible that some smallish stones around its rim \nserved as a kerb. These stones lay over a thin layer of sandy silt [8015] also \nsurrounding this hearth. From 8015 was recovered a small copper alloy artefact, \nidentified as the point from a pair of dividers. \n 18\n     A sample from 8010 in the hearth was submitted to Carolina Belmar and                        \nLuciana Quiroz for archaeobotanical analysis. A summary of their report is given \nbelow, but here it may be noted that the plant remains recovered appeared to represent \nlocal weeds and plants with no bias towards those that might have been exploited for \nfood or other uses by humans. \n     A sample from 8012 in the hearth was submitted to the Beta Analytic Radiocarbon \nDating Laboratory in Miami, Florida for dating. The calendar calibration for this \nsample is complex, providing multiple calendar range segments. The sample data is as \nfollows: \n \nLaboratory sample number: beta-203314 \nAnalysis: AMS-Standard delivery \nMaterial\/Pre-treatment: (charred material): acid\/alkali\/acid \nMeasured Radiocarbon Age: 270\u00b140 BP \n13C\/12C Ratio: -25.6 o\/oo \nConventional Radiocarbon Age: 260\u00b140 BP \n2 Sigma Calibration: Cal AD 1520 to 1590 (Cal BP 430 to 360) AND Cal AD 1620 to \n1670 (Cal BP 330 to 280). Cal AD 1770 to 1800 (Cal BP 180 to 150) AND Cal AD \n1940 to 1950 (cal BP 10 to 0). \nInterception of the radiocarbon age with the calibration curve gives a date of AD 1650 \n(Cal BP 300), and a 1 Sigma calibrated result (68% probability) of AD 1640 to 1660 \n(Cal BP 310 to 290).27 \n      \n     Hearth 8016 is partially cut by the foundation trench [8009] for the building\u2019s east \nwall, demonstrating that it was no longer in use during the initial stages of the \n 19\nbuilding\u2019s construction. It is set into the surface of 9011-9012 \u2013 or 8017-8018, as it is \nlabelled in the trench 8 sequence. This complex layer of silty clay is dark brown \n(10YR 4\/3) in its upper part, changing, without any distinct break, to dark yellowish \nbrown (10YR 4\/4) in its lower part. It is interpreted as the old ground surface \ncontaining an A and a B horizon. It directly overlies the parent material, in \narchaeological terms, natural clay [8019\/9019]. This old ground surface is present in \ntrenches 8 and 9 but not in 6 and 7 because the ground falls away quite steeply in an \neasterly direction (Fig. 19). Whereas the builders had to cut into the natural at the \nwest end of the building to create a level surface for the floor, further east they had to \ndump clay on to the ground surface. This is layer 9006 (also labelled 8007), a \ncompact layer of silty clay with small stones. It is, essentially, re-deposited natural, \npressed firmly into place. \n     Further indications of human activity prior to the construction of the building were \ndiscovered in trench 9, and also in an extension to trench 9, about 1m square, added \non its west side. Firstly there is the evidence for a group of small post- or stake-holes \n(Figs 16 and 20). One of these, 9014, could clearly be traced by its darker fill [9013] \nshowing against the dark yellowish brown of 9012 (Fig. 15). This indicates that it was \ndug from the old ground surface that supported hearth 8016. It has a diameter of about \n140mm and is cut into the natural clay for a depth of about 100mm. Its original depth \nwhen dug, however, would probably have been about 300mm. Its fill [9013] consisted \nof clay, with some silt. \n     At least two other post-holes [9016, 9018] were tentatively identified as shallow \ncuts in the natural clay, 9019. It is possible that all three post-holes represent part of \nthe side of a structure supported on a wooden framework. \n 20\n     Also pre-dating the erection of the building is a thin deposit of dark brown (7.5YR \n3\/2) powdered ash [9009] set in or on the old ground surface 9011, encountered in the \ntrench 9 extension, and to a lesser extent in trench 9 adjacent to the north wall of the \nbuilding (fig. 19). It is not clear if it might have been cut away by the digging of a \nfoundation trench for the north wall, in which case it might be the tenuous remains of \nanother hearth. Perhaps a more likely interpretation is that it represents ash cleared \nfrom hearth 8016 and dumped down the hillside. \n     With the excavation of trench 9 and its extension it became clear that much of the \ninterior of the building had had a large pit or trench dug into it when already choked \nwith debris from its collapse. It was back-filled soon afterwards, mostly with a mixed \ndeposit of silty clay containing many fragments of brick and roof tiles. This deposit is \nidentified in trench 9 as 9004, elsewhere as 8002, 7004 and 6004 (figs 10, 11 and 19). \nThis pit extended up to the west and south walls of the building, cutting below the \nfloor level in places. Fortunately, an area was left unaffected at the east end of the \ninterior. The edge of this pit was traced in trench 9 running approximately NNE- SSW \nand cutting through 9012 to the natural clay. It can also be seen in the N-S section of \nthe trench 9 extension cutting through the clay [9005] slumped from the north wall, \nthe make-up for the floor [9006], and into the old ground surface [9011]. The date and \npurpose of this excavation is unrecorded. \n \n \nTRENCHES 10 & 11 \n \nThe area to the east of the building\u2019s entrance was opened up as trenches 10 and 11 in \norder to explore the porch and the extent of the paved surface (Figs 8 and 14). It was \n 21\nnot possible to dig all of this owing to the presence of indigenous trees, but eventually \nthe margins of the paving were uncovered, lying under a thin layer of topsoil. Overall, \nit forms an area the full width of the building (5.5m) and slopes down hill for almost \n2m in front of the entrance. From its surface and within the area of the entrance were \nrecovered several sherds of an earthenware storage vessel, glazed internally. Perhaps \nbecause they had not been dug up and smashed by the excavators of the pit within the \nbuilding there were also many more substantial pieces of roof tile here. \n \n \nTRENCH 12 \n \nThis trench, about 1m by 1.5m, was excavated adjacent to the exterior of the south \nwall of the building, as an extension at the south-west corner of trench 11 (figs 8, 14 \nand 21). The intention was to check for the presence of earlier occupation deposits \noutside the building. A recent topsoil [12001] and subsoil [12002] was found \noverlying the silty clay [12003] collapse from the wall and a compressed layer of roof \ntiles [12004] that had slid off the roof. An earlier ground surface [12009-12010] was \ncovered by a layer [12008] of re-deposited natural clay, perhaps something to do with \nthe building operations. It had been cut through by the foundation trench [12006] of \nthe south wall. To the south of the trench it had been worn away, perhaps, rather than \ncut, and replaced by a deposit [12007] of silt and small stones, representing the path \nthat ran up the side of the building. \n \n \nTHE FINDS \n 22\n The finds have all been lodged in the Museum in San Juan Bautista. \n \nROOF TILES \n \nNo whole examples of roof tiles were recovered but when complete they were about \n220mm in width and greater in length than 430mm.  They are of red earthenware and \nhave a curved profile, giving them a maximum height of about 50mm. They could all \nbelong to the one batch from the one kiln. Fragments were found in all trenches apart \nfrom 1 and 2 with heavy concentrations in trenches 10, 11 and12, apparently lying \nwhere they had fallen off the roof of the building. Fragments of similar tiles can be \nfound around the ruins of the fort in San Juan Bautista, built by the Spanish in 1751 \nand garrisoned until 1837. \n \n \nBRICKS \n \nFragments of red bricks were recovered in all trenches except 1 and 2. They were \nmostly in the deposits within the building, with some lying at floor level. The bricks \nwhen whole were about 135mm by 270mm by 45mm. If, as suggested above, they \nformed the floor of the building, there would have been about 404 of them. At least \none appears to have been cut neatly, diagonally, perhaps indicating that they were not \nlaid parallel to the walls. \n \n \n 23\nCERAMICS \n \nA total of 75 sherds of pottery were found, some in clearing the vegetation from the \nsite, the rest from the trenches, all except trenches 5 and 12. The sherds from the \ntrenches within the walls of the building were all from deposits backfilled or \ncollapsed in and over the pit dug through its ruins.  \n     The following notes are derived from a report prepared by Daniela Baudet and \nLorena Sanhueza.28  \n \nMonochrome pottery \n \n26 sherds of monochrome pottery were found. By monochrome is meant plain, \nearthenware, made by hand without the use of a wheel. This traditional way of \nmaking pottery continued after the Spanish conquest of Chile. It is often difficult to \ntell whether such earthenware, commonly found on archaeological sites, is of pre- or \npost- Hispanic manufacture. Systematic archaeological studies in the past few years of \nhistorical contexts with ceramics have, however, determined certain morphological, \ntechnological and decorative differences between pre- and post-hispanic pottery. They \nhave also allowed certain conclusions on the origin of different types. The \nminerological inclusions of volcanic origin visible in many of the sherds from Aguas \nBuenas suggest that they could have been made on the island.29  \n \nLead glazed earthenware \n \n 24\n9 sherds of lead glazed earthenware were recovered. They are typical of Hispanic \nassemblages from historic sites of the central zone of Chile, mainly in urban areas.30 \nFindings of this type in other areas of the island have previously been reported.31 \nThey are of Spanish-American origin, though the precise source of these sherds is still \nunder investigation. Lead glazed earthenware manufacturing sites seem to have been \nwidespread throughout South America during the Colonial Period.32 \n \nEarthenware storage vessels \n \nA total of 31 sherds were recovered. Of these, 18 sherds appear to come from the one \nvessel called a botija in Spanish, approximately 30cm to 40cm in height with a flat \nbase, everted rim, and green glaze on the interior. On typological grounds it can be \ndated to the 18th century.33 Another 13 sherds are from thick walled vessels (15mm to \n23mm in thickness). Although abraded, many have traces of a black resin on the \ninterior. Such vessels were used from the 16th to the 20th century for the transport, \ntrade and storage of food and other products.34  \n \nStoneware \n \nNine sherds of whiteware with a colourless glaze, probably English, 19th century.35 \n \n \nNAILS \n \n 25\nThe remains of nine iron nails were recovered, eight of them with shanks that are \nrectangular in cross-section. The most complete (no 3) had a length of over 165mm.  \nTwo of them (nos 3 and 5) were found in the topsoil covering the paved surface in \nfront of the building, the rest in the debris filling the building. Most came from the \nvicinity of the entranceway and may have served originally to secure the timber of the \ndoor and its frame. A small length of iron, about 23mm in length and circular in cross-\nsection may be the remains of a ninth nail. It was recovered in trench 9 from the \nbackfill [9004] of the pit dug through the collapse and deposits filling up the interior \nof the building. \n \n \nA COPPER ALLOY TIP \u2013 FROM A PAIR OF DIVIDERS? \n \nA small piece of copper alloy with various layers of rather powdery green\/blue\/grey \ncorrosion was recovered from deposit 8015, a thin layer of sandy silt surrounding \nhearth 8016 (Figs 22 and 23). It is about 16mm long and has a square cross-section at \none end about 3mm by 3mm. Here it appears to have been cleanly broken before the \non-set of corrosion. From this end to the other it tapers on three of its four sides to \nform a point. \n     The sure identification of such a fragment is difficult. It is not unlike the tip of a \npin from a buckle, or the shaft from a rivet or a nail. The particular way it tapers, \nhowever, suggests that it is from a pair of dividers. Another similar tip could be \npositioned alongside, the two together forming a single point. Other early dividers \nhave legs which are either triangular in cross-section or rectangular as with the \nfragment from Aguas Buenas.  \n 26\n     It was submitted to the Analytical Research Section of the National Museums of \nScotland for examination in May 2005. The resulting report is summarised here: \n \nXRF and SEM examination of copper alloy fragment from Aguas Buenas. \nAnalytical Research Section Report No. AR 06\/25 (C&AR 13214) \n \nBy Jim Tate \n \nThe copper alloy tip from Aguas Buenas was examined along with seven pairs of \ndividers, five of which came from the collections of the National Museums of \nScotland: \n\u2022 three pairs of dividers (Fig. 24) from HMS Dartmouth, sunk off the Island of \nMull, Scotland, in 1690 (reg. nos HXD 381, HXD 326 and HXD 327). \n\u2022 dividers from an unidentified shipwreck at Duart Point off the Island of Mull, \nScotland, (unreg.). \n\u2022 German made dividers, unsigned, mid 18th-century (reg. no T.1985.79). \n\u2022 two pairs of dividers, thought to be European (Nuremberg?) 16-17th century \n(Private collection, D. Coffeen).  \n \n     The physical form of the fragment was similar to the points of the HMS \nDartmouth dividers HXD 381 and HXD 327, although each of these has a more \ntriangular cross section. The other instruments had finer pointed legs and again \ntriangular or semi-circular cross sections. Physically the fragment was in a \nconsiderably more unstable and corroded state than any of the complete instruments. \n 27\n     The tip was first examined under a low power optical microscope. Surface analysis \nwas then undertaken using X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) to determine the main alloy \ncomponents.36 The whole fragment was then examined in a Scanning Electron \nMicroscope (SEM) to look for surface detail. The SEM examination also included \nsome further Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX).37 Following this examination \na small area of the surface was cleaned and re-analysed by XRF and SEM-EDX.  \n     The complete dividers were analysed in a number of places using XRF with no \nsurface preparation. The averaged results of these semi-quantitative analyses are \ngiven in table 1. \n \n \n Fe Ni Cu Zn As Pb Ag Sn Sb \n          \nFragment 2.6 0.0 81.1 0.4 1.4 0.4 0.1 13.9 0.2 \n 5.2 0.0 87.1 0.7 0.5 0.3 0.0 6.3 0.0 \nHXD 327 0.7 0.0 74.4 22.0 0.0 1.3 0.1 1.4 0.0 \nHXD 381 0.9 0.0 67.8 25.9 0.1 1.0 0.4 3.8 0.1 \nHXD 326 0.4 0.0 69.8 28.3 0.0 1.0 0.1 0.3 0.0 \nDuart \nPoint 0.7 0.0 69.7 28.3 0.0 1.0 0.2 0.3 0.0 \nCoffeen \n1 0.2 0.5 71.9 27.0 0.1 0.3 0.1 0.0 0.1 \nCoffeen \n2 0.3 0.3 70.4 28.8 0.1 0.2 0.1 0.0 0.0 \nTable 1: average surface analysis XRF data from the Aguas Buenas fragment and \ncomplete instruments. \n \n 28\n     XRF has the great advantage that it is non-destructive: however it has the \ndisadvantage that only the surface composition can be determined, ie the material within \nthe upper 0.1mm or less. This means that the analyses include surface corrosion and any \nchanges to the body metal from chemical alteration or cleaning. Following the surface \nanalysis it was therefore agreed that the end of one flat face of the sample could be \nlightly cleaned to reveal the underlying metal. The area (about 2mm by 2mm) was \nabraded using fine silicone carbide paper (final surface 1000 grade) and then polished \nwith diamond paste to get a reasonably clean and smooth surface. However it was clear \nthat the corrosion was deeper than it was possible to polish without removal of an \nunacceptable amount of metal, so pitted areas remained.  \n     Figure 25 shows the cleaned area as examined in the SEM, back-scatter detector \n(BSC) images at increasing magnification. The variation in grey indicates different \natomic number composition: the areas of corrosion pitting are dark grey, with medium \ngrey showing as an oxide layer (where the corrosion has not been fully removed). The \npale grey is the underlying metal alloy. Isolated areas where corrosion remains show \nsulphur and chlorine. The small bright spots are bismuth. \n     Inspection of the higher magnification image in figure 25 shows bands of alternating \nphases which have different amounts of tin in the copper alloy. Areas of lead lie mainly \nbetween these bands (although it was not possible to distinguish unambiguously between \nlead and sulphur corrosion), while small areas rich in bismuth show up as bright spots, \noccurring in the tin-rich phase.  \n \n \nThe analytical results from the cleaned surface obtained by XRF are given in table 2.  \n \n 29\n Fe Ni Cu Zn As Pb Ag Sn Sb \n          \nXRF Analysis 0.1 nd 91.6 0.3 0.4 0.2 nd 7.2 tr \nTable 2. XRF data for cleaned area. Various parts of this area were also analysed by \nSEM-EDX confirming the presence of variable levels of tin, as well as the other metal \nimpurities \n \n     Three separate copper alloy standards were analysed at the same time as the sample \nand the instruments. The full results are not presented here but can be found in the \ninternal report. \n \nDiscussion \nThe analyses presented here clearly show that the metal fragment is bronze, different \nin composition from the complete dividers examined which were brass, (or a further \nexample which was in fact steel decorated with brass and is not included in the data \nhere). Although two of the dividers (HXD 327 and HXD 381) do contain tin above \n1%, the levels are less than the surface analyses of the Aguas Buenas fragment. The \ntin level in the fragment is lower in the polished area, illustrating the extent of surface \ncorrosion. There are differences in other elements, but most fundamentally it is the \nhigh levels of zinc in all the complete instruments which show that they are basically \nbrass rather than bronze. \n     The surface analyses of the corroded sides of the fragment showed higher levels of \ntin and arsenic than from the metal with the surface layer removed. This is most likely \nto be because of the corrosion process (the iron level also drops, and is assumed to be \ncontamination from burial soil included in the corrosion surface). The tin and arsenic \nlevels of the broken end are midway between the sides and the clean metal: this could \n 30\nindicate that the break occurred after the sides had already started corroding, although \nit would be unwise to read too much into the differences as all the analyses were from \nrough surfaces providing less than ideal analytical conditions. \n     The SEM EDX maps show clearly the presence of small, distinct, amounts of  \nbismuth. This could not be quantified in the XRF analyses, but was estimated to be \nsimilar to the amount of lead, ie less than 0.5%. Bismuth does not normally occur in \nsignificant quantities in copper alloys, however its presence in 18th-century Cornish \ncopper has been reported by Craddock and Hook.38 They note that the presence of up \nto 1% Bi would lead to a brittle alloy (ie copper containing bismuth rather than \nbronze). \n     The structure of the metal shown in the SEM images suggest that it is cast rather \nthan heavily worked.  \n \nConclusions \nThe Aguas Buenas fragment is bronze, different in composition from the small \nnumber of dividers which it has been possible to analyse in the early stage of this \nproject, each of which was brass (or a mixed alloy predominantly brass). The sample \nsize of comparison instruments is far too small to draw any definite conclusions, and \nit may well be that further analyses reveal other early dividers made from a similar \nbronze. As a further comparison we note however that analysis by NMS of 177 \nindividual components of 8 astrolabes from the 11th to the 18th century were all brass \n(with zinc levels typically above 20% and always above 10%).39 Analysis of 58 large \ncopper-alloy brooches of a form typical of Late Medieval Highland Scotland (one of \nwhich was recovered from the wreck of HMS Dartmouth) also showed that they were \nall brass, with an average of 25% zinc.40 From analyses of 31 Scottish Late Medieval \n 31\ncooking pots, only 1 had a composition close to that of the Aguas Buenas fragment.41 \nOther published data on early scientific instruments shows the prevalence of brass, \ninitially from Germany, Holland and Sweden, with increasing amounts of zinc.42 The \nconclusion is that the use of bronze for scientific instruments of this type or for \ndecorative brooches in Scotland at this period is unusual. \n     The bronze composition, containing bismuth, could indicate that the copper came \nfrom Cornwall, where a bismuth containing alloy was known to have been exploited \nin the 17th century. \n     The presence of bismuth may make the alloy brittle and hard: possibly why it has \nbroken quite cleanly, with no obvious distortion or bending of the remaining \nfragment. \n     The cross-section shape of the fragment is similar, but does not closely match, the \npointed end of the legs of the dividers examined. Again the comparative samples are \ntoo few to draw any firm conclusions. \n \n \nREPORT ON SOIL SAMPLE FROM HEARTH 8016 43 \n \nBy Carolina Belmar P. and Luciana Quiroz l.  \n \nMethodology  \n \nA 2.8 litre soil sample was submitted for environmental sampling. The sample came \nfrom context 8010, a layer about 50mm thick of yellowish brown ash and charcoal, \nwith small fragments of burnt bone, none of which was identifiable. Context 8010 is \nthe uppermost layer in hearth 8016.  \n 32\n     The sample was processed by means of flotation with the intention of recovering \nplant remains, particularly fruits and seeds. Flotation results in minimal damage of \nfragile remains. The technique involves placing the soil sample over a constant flow \nof water. This allows the separation of a light fraction (material that floats, like plant \nremains) and a heavy fraction (ceramic, l\u00edthics, bone, shells, etc.). The heavy fraction \nis deposited in a sieve with a 3mm mesh. The remaining sediment is washed away.  \n      \nAnalysis of the light fraction \n \nThe plant remains were separated from the light fraction using a binocular microscope \n(magnification x20). They were then identified, taking note of their completeness and \nwhether or not they were carbonised. Identification was supported by the use of a \nreference collection of modern seeds and fruits and others derived from \narchaeological contexts, and also by consultation of appropriate text books.44 Finally, \ntaxa were grouped, as is conventional, according to their origins:  \n\u2022 endemic (exclusive to Chilean territory and contiguous countries)  \n\u2022 native non-endemic (introduced to Chilean territory before the Spanish \n  conquest)  \n\u2022 accidental (foreign, introduced after the Spanish conquest).  \nNo plant remains have been identified to species level. The remains with a strong \nprobability of corresponding to a species have the abbreviation cf placed in front of \nthe denomination (example: cf Brassicaceae). Remains whose identification did not \nreach species level are ascribed to a family (example: Brassicaceae sp.).  \n \nResults  \n 33\n A total of 41 plant remains were rescued, from which the calculation can be made that \nthere is a density of 18.63 per litre in context 8010. 95.12% of the remains have been \nidentified. 73.17 were carbonized.  \n \n Condition  \nTaxon Carbonised Not Carbonised Total \ncf.

(family, quilloi-quilloi, 11 \npieces). Examples of cf Brassicaceae sp. (family, yuyo, 23 pieces) make up the group \nof carbonised remains. Two seeds were also carbonised. Both belong to taxa \ncorresponding to herbaceous plants, probably common weeds. The presence of these \ncarbonised remains may result from the burning of wild herbaceous plants and weeds \nalong with grass, not necessarily intentionally. The two seeds, however, might have \nbeen carbonised elsewhere. This can be deduced from the fact there are only two, \ntheir size, and the type of plant they come from. \n \nConclusion  \n \n 34\nGiven the imprecise identification of the few plant remains recovered in this deposit it \nis difficult to conclude that they have any link with any economic activity. Rather \nthey may result from the burning of herbaceous plants and weeds of no economic use. \nThere is no evidence for the processing of vegetable resources.  \n \n \nINTERPRETATION \n \nThree phases of human activity can clearly be distinguished at Aguas Buenas. \n \n \nPHASE 1 \n \nA small level piece of ground was occupied by one or more men, probably of \nEuropean origin, some time prior to the mid 18th century. The calibrated radiocarbon \ndetermination from a piece of charcoal in hearth 8016 suggests that a date about 1640 \nto 1660 is quite likely. The piece of wood that was carbonised may have been long \ndead or have included core material from a trunk, and could thus give a date many \nyears earlier than the date of the fire that consumed it. The mid 17th-century is \nessentially a terminus post quem date, though on this basis we might not expect the \nfire to have been lit much later than the early years of the 18th century. There is \nevidence for two hearths which might represent the activities of more than one person \nor two distinct episodes of different date. The post-holes suggest the presence of some \nform of shelter. Historical sources provide us with a limited range of possible \nresidents in the years from the mid 17th to the mid 18th century. Most who came to the \n 35\nisland were visitors seeking to stock up on supplies, repair their ships or rest sick men. \nThey stayed a few weeks at most and probably did not venture far from Cumberland \nBay except to cut wood and hunt goats. There was no requirement for any of these \nvisitors to camp or settle far from the bay other than those who were renegades and \ncastaways abandoned by their shipmates.  \n     Apart from Alexander Selkirk, the most likely candidates are: \n1. A Miskito Indian called Will, abandoned by mistake in 1681 at Puerto Ingl\u00e9s \nby English privateers. He was rescued by another English expedition in 1684 \nand is generally considered to be the prototype for `Friday\u2019 in Defoe\u2019s \nRobinson Crusoe.45 \n2. A group of five English buccaneers and four negro boys left on the island at \ntheir own request in 1687 by the same buccaneering expedition that had \npicked up Will the Miskito Indian. They had gambled away their share of the \nprize money and hoped to be picked up by the next expedition to land on the \nisland so that they could have another chance to make money. They were \nprovided with a small boat, a porridge pot, axes, machetes, corn seed and \nsome other provisions. They were eventually rescued by an English \nprivateering expedition under Captain John Strong in 1690.46 \n3. Two men contrived to escape in 1719 from the privateering voyage led by \nCaptain John Clipperton and Captain George Shelvocke but were picked up \nafter two months by a ship sent by the Spanish Viceroy of Peru.47  \n4. In May 1720 Captain Shelvocke\u2019s ship the Speedwell was wrecked in \nCumberland Bay, but he and his men managed to escape in October in a boat \nthey built themselves from the wreckage of the Speedwell. Eleven or twelve \nrenegades, with a similar number of Blacks and Indians, had deserted the main \n 36\nparty while on the island, and refused to leave the island with the rest.48 They \nhad been removed by the Spanish by early 1722.49      \n     If the metal tip from Aguas Buenas is part of pair of dividers then it is of crucial \nimportance in identifying the early occupant of the site. Only a ship\u2019s master or \nnavigator is likely to have had such an instrument. Of all those renegades and \ncastaways known to have been abandoned on the island only Selkirk held such a \nposition, had such skills. What is more, he is specifically said by his rescuer, Woodes \nRogers, to have had `his mathematical instruments and books\u2019 with him. In \narchaeological terms, the evidence for a pair of dividers at Aguas Buenas is probably \nthe closest one can get to proving that Alexander Selkirk lived there. \n     If the pair of dividers were Selkirk\u2019s so must also have been at least one of the \nhearths [8016]. The presence of small fragments of bone in context 8010 in this hearth \nsuggests the cooking of meat, and for what it is worth, there is no evidence for grain \nor other foodstuffs which would have been unavailable to a castaway like Selkirk. It is \nprobable that the post-holes were made by him as well as the other hearth [6006]. It is \npossible that the two hearths represent his two huts, one serving as a dwelling the \nother as a kitchen. There is no indication in Woodes Rogers\u2019 account of whether these \ntwo huts were adjacent to each other or far apart. Whatever the case, Selkirk would \nhave found it easier to build two small huts rather than one large one. \n     In Selkirk\u2019s day, and much later, there was still a tradition in many parts of \nScotland of taking the cattle and sheep in the summer months away from the growing \ncrops to pasture in the hills. Here little huts known as shielings were constructed by \nthose looking after the animals. They were often circular in plan, constructed of a \nframework of branches covered in turf, as the huts on the island of Jura described by a \ntravel writer in 1772.50 In the mid 19th century it was noted how, on the island of \n 37\nHarris and Lewis, there were often two huts together, one serving as a dwelling, the \nother for keeping utensils and the butter and cheese made from the animals\u2019 milk.51  \nGiven Selkirk\u2019s limited range of equipment and resources, and his cultural \nbackground, he might have been expected to erect simple huts with a framework of \nstakes, set in post-holes and tied together at the top, rather like Scottish shieling huts. \nWithout a ready supply of turf he may have woven bits of grass in a framework of \nbranches, creating a structure rather like a basket. A lining of goat skins would have \nbeen necessary to make the structure weather tight. Even the concept of having two \nhuts rather than one may derive from some memory or experience of life at the \nshielings. The excavated post-holes, while clearly not amounting to much as evidence, \nwould, at least, not be inconsistent with such an interpretation. \n \n \nNAVIGATIONAL DIVIDERS AND ALEXANDER SELKIRK \n \nBy A. D. Morrison-Low \n \nThe discovery of a metal fragment which might have formed the tip of a pair of \nnavigational dividers belonging to Alexander Selkirk raises a number of questions, to \nwhich some speculative answers will be given here. The accident of geography and \nAlexander\u2019s Selkirk\u2019s birthplace had much to do with his juvenile yearnings to \nbecome a sailor. Lower Largo is one of many small towns that line the estuary of the \nriver Forth, or Firth of Forth, as it is marked on contemporary maps. A recent \narchitectural guide characterises it as \u2018a fishing village made a burgh of barony in \n1513\u2019, a status not as elevated as neighbouring royal burghs, but giving it certain \n 38\ntrading privileges.52 During Selkirk\u2019s lifetime, much of the sea-borne traffic in the \nFirth was on its way to or from Leith, the port for Scotland\u2019s capital city, Edinburgh, \ntrading with the Low Counties, and less frequently with the Baltic, Portugal and \nBordeaux. Another component of this flotilla, the more local inshore vessels, would \nhave been fishing for the rich and varied harvest of the sea and would have had less \nneed of navigational instruments, being usually always in sight of the coast.53 \n     Nevertheless, Selkirk\u2019s youthful and successful desire to run away to sea begs the \nquestion: where did this shoemaker\u2019s son learn his navigation skills? A biography \npublished in Edinburgh over a century after his death states that: \nAt a proper age he was sent to school, where he made considerable progress in the \nbranches usually taught, more especially in navigation as the whole bent of his mind \nwas to go to sea. [Footnote: John Selcraig, his grand-nephew, remembers quite well, \nthat, when he was a child, his father often gave him as a plaything the scale he used, \nto amuse himself. It was kept as a relic by his friends.].54 \n     Conversely, it would appear that there is evidence for only a handful of schools \nwhere navigation was taught in Scotland before 1707, and those were based mainly in \nLeith or Edinburgh. After the Union of the Parliaments, Glasgow was in a position to \nexploit its west coast location and the trade across the Atlantic, and it seems that at \nleast six navigation teachers were active there by about 1760, as well as others in the \nsouth-west, and along the Firth of Forth.55 By the late 19th century, \u2018it was well \nknown, however, that despite the availability of teaching facilities on land, the \nmajority of seamen learned part, or all of their navigation on ships\u2019.56 Even so, \nsources for the late 17th century are scanty, and so it is impossible to provide a \ncomplete picture of the various aspects of teaching of navigation at that time,57 and \n 39\nso where Selkirk might have learned this skill must remain a matter of speculation, \neither at a school in Scotland, or on a ship once he had run away to sea. \n     There is certainly no need to doubt that Selkirk was literate, and amongst the books \nhe had on the island was a `journal of his observations\u2019, the existence of which is \nknown about since his widow sought its return from the Duke of Hamilton soon after \nAlexander\u2019s death in 1721.58 Perhaps it was in this that he kept the account of the \n500 goats he killed while on the island.59  \n     What were Selkirk\u2019s \u2018Mathematical Instruments\u2019 likely to have been, and where \nmight he have acquired them? In fact, what did early 17th-century oceanic (as \nopposed to inshore) navigators need to find their position on the earth\u2019s surface? As \ndescribed by Peter Ifland, it is measurement of \u2018the angles \u2013 the angle between the \nhorizontal and a star, the angle between the vertical and a star, or even the angle \nbetween one celestial body and another\u2019.60 When the horizon is invisible, as it \nbecomes in bad weather, then a plumb bob will always produce a straight line \npointing towards the Earth\u2019s centre, and \u2018these two reference lines, a horizontal line to \nthe horizon or a vertical line established by the force of gravity, form the basis for \ndesign of virtually every instrument that mariners have used for measuring the angles \nneed for celestial navigation\u2019.61 \n     Navigating the oceans had been undertaken since antiquity, and generations of \nobservations since then had produced nautical knowledge and wisdom that could be \nbuilt upon. Experience had taught sailors to name the winds from the quarter they \ncame from, and to recognise the changing night skies throughout the year. Sailing \ndirections apparently survive from about 500 BC, giving course and distance (in terms \nof a day\u2019s sail) between various ports, including descriptions of the coastline, \ninformation about anchorages, currents and depths. By the 15th century, Portuguese \n 40\nmariners under the leadership of Prince Henry the Navigator found that using the \nMediterranean methods of dead-reckoning and the Scandinavian technique of \nsounding the sea bed were inadequate in the Atlantic and for voyages further a field. \nAstronomical sailing, or \u2018running down the latitude\u2019 was developed about this time in \nwhich \u2018the navigator sought the latitude of his destination and followed it rather than \ntaking the direct route which he could not determine. The new rule told the pilot \nsimply how far on each of the sixteen half-winds or compass directions he would have \nto sail to \u201craise a degree\u201d, that is to alter his latitude by one degree, and how much \neasting or westing he would then make\u2019.62  \n     The angle-measuring instruments available to the ocean-going mariner in the late \n17th century would have been the mariner\u2019s astrolabe,63 the cross-staff 64 or the \nback-staff 65. Neither the octant nor the sextant was developed until the mid-18th \ncentury, and so would have been unavailable to Alexander Selkirk and his \ncontemporaries. Before the development of the ocean-going chronometer, or even the \ninvention, improvement and cheapening of mechanical clocks, the most widespread \ntimekeeper was the sundial. This instrument is impractical at sea, as it has to be set for \nparticular latitudes; and it is useless at night or in adverse weather conditions. Instead, \nsailors used a device known as the nocturnal, which dates from the 15th century, and \nacted as a star-pointer: brass examples are known, but many cheaper wooden patterns \nsurvive.66 Other navigation instruments that would have been available \u2013 but not \nnecessarily considered as part of the mariner\u2019s own tackle, more as ship\u2019s equipment - \nwould have been the magnetic compass (for direction), the log-line (for depth and an \nestimation of speed), and the traverse board, used for course-plotting in association \nwith a sandglass.67 Nevertheless, most of these devices were made of wood, only the \nmariner\u2019s astrolabe and the occasional nocturnal being constructed of brass or bronze. \n 41\n     All of these would, however, have been expensive, and although not unknown in \nScotland, they would certainly not have been produced there, as an indigenous \ninstrument manufacturing trade did not emerge there until the mid-18th century.68 \nEven so, a number of examples of these instruments with a 17th-century Scottish \nprovenance have been noted.69 It is more likely that Selkirk would have obtained any \nnavigation instruments on the unrecorded voyages he made in the years of silence \naway from Lower Largo, in any of the major ports of England, Ireland or Europe. \nNavigational instruments, new or second-hand, would have been widely obtainable in \nthe docks around the Thames, or possibly in Bristol, England\u2019s second port. Daniel \nDefoe was to describe Bristol in 1724 as \u2018the greatest, the richest, and the best port of \ntrade in Great Britain, London only excepted. The merchants not only have the \ngreatest trade, but they trade with a more entire independency upon London, than any \nother town in Britain\u2019.70 \n     In an unpublished analysis of Bristol probate inventories between 1640 and 1775, \nJonathan Barry found that seafarers were those most likely to be found in possession \nof scientific instruments: \u2018The well-equipped mariner possessed plots and charts, as \nwell as books for the sea, with compasses and dials, a prospecting or spy glass, and a \nrange of such things as cross staffs, fore staffs, scales and quadrants.\u2019 Barry located \ntwo inventories which contained all these items, both dating from 1684, but \ninstruments other than these essential navigation tools were only occasionally \nmentioned in the inventories.71 \n     There was another pair of somewhat less glamorous instruments that was an \nessential part of the navigator\u2019s kit, used in conjunction with his charts and tables: his \ndividers and scale. The item found on Robinson Crusoe Island may have been the tip \nof one side of a pair of navigational dividers. Dividers have been known since \n 42\nantiquity, a pair of proportional dividers having been found at Pompeii, \u2018but few \nsurviving examples of dividers are dateable and it is therefore difficult at present to \ndetermine anything about their development\u2019.72 Replicas of a variety of dividers \nuncovered at Pompeii have been illustrated.73 Subsequently, \u2018dividers were \nubiquitous instruments in the Middle Ages used in a variety of trades and differing \ngreatly in size\u2019.74 However, Turner remarks that whereas Roman dividers were \ngenerally made from bronze, iron occurred more plentifully in north-west Europe than \naround the Mediterranean, and he surmises that \u2018dividers had been made of this \nmaterial from at least the 10th century\u2019.75 Dividers \u2013 also known as compasses \u2013 have \nlong been used to draw circles in a variety of occupations and survive in a number of \ndifferent forms.76 \n     For navigators, dividers were principally used in plotting course or distance on sea \ncharts, and were also used with plain scales. The plain scale was a boxwood \nmathematical ruler, based on the 17th-century Gunter\u2019s rule, with a number of \ndifferent logarithmic scales.77 One modern author writes that \u2018in addition to the line \nof numbers, Gunter scales eventually evolved to include at least seventeen other \nscales for use in trigonometry and navigation\u2019.78 It is probable that Selkirk\u2019s wooden \nscale, mentioned by Howell, was one of these: unfortunately, it has not been seen \nsince some time before 1829. The plain scale \u2018was designed to project spherical \nproblems on a two-dimensional plane, for example reducing a calculation from the \nearth\u2019s surface into a flat chart\u2019.79  \n     During Selkirk\u2019s lifetime, the sea chart was in its formative stages, and the voyages \nin which he somewhat unwittingly participated contributed to their improvement.80 \nAfter Selkirk was abandoned on Robinson Crusoe Island, William Dampier got back \nto England in late 1707 after a disastrous privateering voyage and his second \n 43\ncircumnavigation. He was criticised in print as a poor leader by William Funnell and \nJohn Welbe, and this led to something of a pamphlet war; and he was in legal trouble \nwith his disappointed financial backers.81 However, these Bristol merchants wished \nto recoup their losses, and proposed another privateering voyage to the South Seas, \nthis time led by the more promising young commander, Woodes Rogers (c.1679-\n1732), whose leadership skills were such that, in due course, he became colonial \ngovernor of the Bahamas.82 Two merchant ships, the Duke and Dutchess, were fitted \nout, and William Dampier, now aged 56, was appointed master of the Duke and pilot \nof the expedition, as there was no more experienced navigator to be had. Leaving \nBristol in August 1708, with the intention of intercepting the Manila galleon in \nDecember 1709, the two ships arrived at Robinson Crusoe Island for watering and \nrefitting at the end of January 1709. There, they famously encountered the marooned \nAlexander Selkirk.83 \n     Taking Selkirk aboard, \u2018Dampier recommended Selkirk as having been the best \nman in the Cinque Ports and Rogers duly appointed Selkirk to be mate in the \nDuke\u2019.84 In March 1709, off the Chilean coast, Rogers took a prize, which was \nrenamed the Increase, and Selkirk was appointed master.85 In April the expedition \ncaptured the town of Guayaquil (Ecuador) and Selkirk played an interesting role as \nthe commander of a party of men who frisked Spanish ladies of the jewellery \nconcealed in their clothing.86 After further dangerous and hair-raising adventures, \nRogers captured the Manila galleon, full of treasure, bound for Acapulco, in \nDecember 1709. There were now four ships in their convoy, with the treasure ship, \nthe Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Encarnaci\u00f3n, renamed the Batchelor. Selkirk was appointed \nher master under the command of Captain Thomas Dover.87 \n 44\n     They then set out eastwards across the Pacific Ocean, first to Guam, then to \nBatavia (present day Jakarta on the Island of Java), where Selkirk was involved in \napportioning the booty. As an officer, he also got 80 pieces of eight expenses to \nprovide himself with necessities for the long journey home.88 After a refit, they sailed \nfor the Cape of Good Hope, and from thence to the Shetland Islands, on to the Texel \nand finally back to anchor in the Thames on 14 October 1711.89  \n     Most dividers now in museum collections are made of bronze or brass, with iron or \nsteel tips, or are entirely made of iron or steel. Those described in the British national \ninventory seem to conform to this pattern.90 A selection from some major British \nmuseums with instrument collections is given below. \n \nMuseum Inventory number Description \nNational Maritime Museum NAV0521 Dividers with angle scale, brass \nwith steel points, German c.1650 \nNational Maritime Museum NAV0522 Brass with steel points, c.1650 \nNational Maritime Museum NAV0542 Brass hinge and legs, steel points, \nDutch? c.1650 \nNational Maritime Museum NAV0535 Brass with steel points and arc, \nsigned \u2018Henry Burnet.

Four pairs of all-brass single-handed navigational dividers were \nfound on the Mary Rose, the flag ship of Henry VIII, which sank in 1545. Two pairs \nwere found in the pilot\u2019s cabin, and two came from a chest on the upper deck and may \nhave belonged to the ship\u2019s master.91 Single-handed brass dividers have been \nrecovered from the 1588 Armada wreck, the Trinidad Valencera, and from the \nBarents expedition of 1596, now in the Ulster Museum, Belfast and the Rijksmuseum, \nAmsterdam respectively.92 Several of brass have been discovered from the wreck of \nthe Swedish Royal Ship Kronan which sank off the Baltic island of \u00d6land in 1676. 93 \nTwo other all-brass examples found at Ellan Gheirrag Castle, Argyll, were dated by \nD.J. Bryden to 1685, and thought by him to be Dutch in origin.94 Others from two \nwrecks in the Sound of Mull are discussed in another part of this report. The much \nlater wreck in 1735 of the Dutch East India Company\u2019s ship the \u2019t Vliegend Hart \u2018has \nyielded 18 dividers or parts of dividers. The majority are of the single-handed type \u2026 \nthey are made of cast brass with steel or iron points which inevitably rusted away on \nthe sea-bed. Some differ from this style, for example the all-brass pair of dividers \nwhich is not cast but made of thin folded brass plate\u2019.95 A pair of all-brass dividers \nwas discovered during emergency archaeological excavations in the courtyard of the \nCollegium Novum of the Jagellonian University, Krakow in 2005.96 \n 46\n     In addition, a number of complete brass dividers have passed through the antique \ntrade in recent years, which are crudely constructed: they have poor hinges and no \niron tips, and would therefore have been sold at a low price. Such instruments \u2018tend to \nbe rather small (typically 3\u00bd inches to 4\u00bd inches tall, i.e. about 10 cm tall), with a \nbulbous six- or eight-sided head, rather early (I think 17th [century] and earlier), \nusually of rather unrefined construction with visible areas of hammering and hand-\nfiling, and often carrying an intriguing punch-mark presumably for the maker. Marks \nwe have noted include a pelican, a goblet, a heart, and a bunch of grapes.  There is \noften simple decoration with several boldly incised short straight lines crossing both \nlegs, reminiscent of the bold lines on, for example, sight vanes of some mariners\u2019 \nastrolabes\u2026\u2019.97 One such item has found its way into a museum collection, that of \nthe Smithsonian Institution (inv. no. NMAH 316931 (2)), where there is an all-brass \npair of dividers, measuring 3\u00bc inches (8.3 cm) long, with a spherical hinge at the top. \nAcquired at auction in 1959, \u2018it has no maker\u2019s name, but the outside of each leg has \ntwo groups of three stripes engraved horizontally. One leg also has a five-pointed \nasterisk with a circle around it\u2019.98 It has been suggested that these and others similar \nto them may have been made in Southern Germany, in the metalworking centres, for \ninstance Augsburg and Nuremberg.99 Such crudely made, and therefore cheap, items \nwould have been made for the lower end of the market, and as such, these objects find \ntheir way into museum collections only rarely.100 The results of archaeology perhaps \ngive a better picture of the contemporary use of material culture rather than the \nselective criteria of museums. \n     To sum up: there is every possibility that Selkirk may have taken a cheap pair of \nsingle handed navigators\u2019 dividers as part of the \u2018Mathematical Instruments and \nBooks\u2019 he took ashore with him on Robinson Crusoe Island. That they were of bronze \n 47\nrather than brass is a matter that requires further research. Just how he managed to \nbreak off the point remains a matter of conjecture, but using his dividers for some \ninappropriate task, such as attempting to lever off a piece of stronger metal (possibly \niron or steel), would have resulted in some interesting South Sea language. \n \n \nPHASE 2 \n \nThe level piece of ground, perhaps long abandoned by its previous occupant(s) but \nstill evident as a clearing in the forest reached by a path from Cumberland Bay, was \nextended in area, partly to create a yard and partly to provide clay as a building \nmaterial. In the process, much of the evidence for earlier occupation was removed. \nThe building is aligned E-W and is about 4.5m by 3m internally, probably originally \nwith a floor paved with bricks. The location of windows, if any, could not be \nascertained, but the door was in the west wall and was sheltered by a porch formed by \nextensions of the two side walls. The porch and an area in front of it were paved with \nstones. Although no traces were recovered of whitewash, it is probable that the wall \nsurfaces, inside and out, were coated with it, and there is abundant evidence that the \nroof was covered with red tiles. \n     The lack of any domestic features like a fireplace, and the E-W orientation, \ninitially suggested that the building might be a church. A map of the island published \nby order of its Governor, Fernando de Amaya, in 1795, however, shows a building at \nthis location, identifying it as the Almacen de Polvora (powder store).101 The map \nprovides a useful terminus ante quem for the building\u2019s construction which, given its \n 48\nmilitary function, could hardly have been erected before the fort in the middle of the \n18th century. \n      In 1750 the Spanish engineer, Juan Francisco de Sobrecasas, was instructed by the \nCaptain General of Chile to build a fort at Cumberland Bay and smaller fortifications \nat Puerto Ingl\u00e9s and Puerto Franc\u00e9s, two barely accessible points on the coast, the \nformer about 4 kilometres to the north-west of Cumberland Bay, the latter at the east \nend of the island. This effort coincided with the first serious attempt by the Spanish to \ncolonise the island with the establishment of the settlement of San Juan Bautista. On \n25 May the following year the settlement at San Juan Bautista along with the fort was \ndestroyed by a tsunami and a new fort (Fuerte Santa Barbara) commenced on higher \nground, the one that stands today. It consists of a rectangular platform, 77m by 83m, \nterraced into sloping ground with one bastion at its exposed north-east corner. By \n1779, apart from this fort, there were seven other gun batteries, including those at \nPuerto Ingl\u00e9s and Puerto Franc\u00e9s. The fort had 15 cannon and the batteries a further \n33.102 \n     There was clearly a need for a good supply of gunpowder to service these guns. \nGunpowder magazines often consisted of substantial buildings designed to protect the \npowder from the elements and were located well away from any risk of accidental \nignition by enemy shot or domestic fires. The location at Aguas Buenas, however, is \nremarkably far away from the fort and is most inconvenient for supplying any of the \ngun batteries. It is difficult to understand how it could have had any practical function, \nunless \u2013 and this is just speculation \u2013 it served as a centre for gathering together \ncharcoal for the manufacture of gunpowder. An elderly islander informed us that \ncharcoal used to be prepared in large pits in the ground that were covered over with \nearth. \n 49\n     The ancestors of the present population of the island only arrived in the mid 19th \ncentury, by which time the gunpowder store had probably fallen out of use and \nbecome a ruin. There was thus no memory of it on the island, and when its ruins were \nrediscovered in the 20th century, no one on the island had a clear idea as to what it \nwas.  \n \n \nPHASE 3 \n \nAt some date after its ruin, perhaps in the 20th century, the interior of the building was \nlargely dug out. Perhaps this was an amateur archaeological dig, a search for artefacts, \nor else an effort to salvage tiles and bricks. Whatever the case, the excavation was \nfilled back in again so that this activity was not immediately evident. \n \n \nCONCLUSION \n     \nThe main aim of the project was to identify evidence for the stay on the island of \nAlexander Selkirk. We believe that the remains represented by phase 1 at Aguas \nBuenas were left by Selkirk. Woodes Rogers, his rescuer, called him the governor of \nthe island and describes his healthy existence, catching goats, singing psalms and \npraying.103 Another impression provided by our excavations is of an enemy \ncombatant behind enemy lines. He is forced to hide his huts well away from where \nthey might be discovered by anyone arriving on the island, but near to the lookout \nfrom which he could scan the seas for any approaching ships. Several ships did pass \n 50\nby the island during his stay and his dilemma would have been whether he should try \nand attract their attention or not \u2013 were they friend or foe? \n     The evidence may be meagre but also has a certain value as representing an early \nphase of settlement in this part of the world by Europeans. The gunpowder magazine \nof phase 2 deserves more study as part of the military strategy belonging with the \nSpanish settlement of the island in the mid 18th century. \n     Finally, we would like to suggest that our work has provided some justification for \nrenaming the island Robinson Crusoe, and we hope that Aguas Buenas, with careful \nmanagement, may be a site enjoyed by the increasing number of tourists searching for \nthe inspiration behind Defoe\u2019s masterpiece. \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n \nThe project was sponsored by the National Geographic Society of Washington D.C., \nthe United States of America, and was first featured in the National Geographic \nMagazine for October 2005.

The analysed area was irradiated with \na primary X-ray beam produced by a Rhodium target X-ray tube. The primary beam \nwas collimated to give an analysed area of about 2mm x 1mm. Secondary X-rays \nwere detected with a silicon (lithium) solid state detector.  The detection limit varies \ndepending on the elements, matrix and analytical conditions, but is typically in the \nrange of 0.05%-0.2%. As the analytical technique has a limited penetration depth, the \nreported compositions may not be representative of the bulk of the alloy if there is a \nchemically distinct surface layer. Spectra were collected under the conditions \u201cOld \nXRF\u201d. This uses an operating voltage of 46kV and a current of up to 1000\u03bcA (set \n 54\nautomatically for a 45% dead time) without a primary beam filter to ensure detection \nof all elements of atomic number 19 or above of interest in copper and lead alloys. \nQuantitative data were obtained using the Copper Alloys 2001 method following CPS \nand PPCS set-up.   \n37 The SEM used was a CamScan MX2500 in controlled pressure mode at 10Pa. \nCollimators were wide open (Envac) and spot 2. The accelerating voltage was 20kV \nin all cases. Analysis was using a Noran Vantage EDX system. Count times were \n30sec with around 30% dead time. The analysis was using the Vantage software with \nno standards, and assuming that Cu and Zn were the only elements present.  \n38 Craddock & Hook 1995a & b. \n39 Eremin & Tate 2003. \n40 Eremin et al. 2005. \n41 Tate 2005. \n42 Mortimer 1989. \n43 The report that follows has been edited from the original in Spanish, entitled \nInforme An\u00e1lisis Carpol\u00f3gico. \n44 Martin and Barkley 1973, Matthei 1995, M\u00f6sbach 1999, and Mu\u00f1oz 1966. \n45 Woodward 1969, 25-26; Norris 1994, 47-50. \n46 Woodward 1969, 28-31. \n47 Woodward 1969, 57. \n48 Shelvocke 1928, 114-135. \n49 Woodward 1969, 63. \n50 Pennant 1998, 204. \n51 Thomas 1860, 130. \n52 Gifford 1988, 316. \n 55\n53 Bennett 1987. \n54 Howell 1829, 19. \n55 Gavine 1982, 16-17. \n56 Gavine 1982, 19. \n57 Gavine 1990, 5.  \n58 The petition by Frances Selkirk is undated and uncatalogued and in the collection at \nLennoxlove, East Lothian, the home of the Duke of Hamilton. \n59 Rogers 1712, 72. \n60 Ifland  1998), xiv. \n61 Ifland  1998), xiv. \n62 Taylor, & Richey 1962, 9. \n63 Anderson 1973; Stimson 1988. \n64 M\u00f6rzer Bruyns 1994. \n65 Taylor & Richey 1962, 49-51. \n66 Taylor & Richey 1962, 61-61. \n67 Hutchinson 1994, 164-182. \n68 Morrison-Low 2002, 17-53. \n69 Morrison-Low 1993, 218-222. \n70 Defoe 1724-26, 361-2. \n71 Quoted in Morrison-Low forthcoming. \n72 Turner 1994, 51. \n73 Hambly 1988, 20. \n74 Turner 1994, 99. \n75 Turner 1994, 100. \n76 Hambly 1988, 69-86. \n 56\n77 Van Poelje 2004, 11-22. \n78 Babcock 1994, 14. \n79 M\u00f6rzer Bruyn, & van der Horst 2006, 321. \n80 Howse & Sanderson 1973, 11-12. \n81 Norris 1994, 245. \n82 Mainwaring\u2019s \u2018Introduction\u2019 to Rogers 1712.
