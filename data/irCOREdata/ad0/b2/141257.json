Email: m.rivas-casado@cranfield.ac.uk\nAbstract\nDeoxynivalenol (DON) and Ochratoxin A (OTA) in agricultural commodities present hazards\nto human and animal health. Bulk lots are routinely sampled for their presence, but it is widely\nacknowledged that designing sampling plans is particularly problematical because of their\nheterogeneous distribution. Previous studies have not explicitly looked at the interactions\nbetween the spatial distribution of the mycotoxin and the strategy used to take samples from\nbulk. Sampling plans are therefore designed on the assumption of random distributions. The\nobjective of this study was to analyse the spatial distribution of DON and OTA in bulk\ncommodities with geostatistics. This study was the first application of geostatistical analysis to\ndata on mycotoxins contamination of bulk commodities.\nData sets for DON and OTA in bulk storage were collected from the literature and\npersonal communications, of which only one contained data suitable for geostatistical analysis.\nThis data set represented a 26 t truck of wheat with total of 100 sampled points. The mean\nconcentrations of DON and OTA were 1342 \u03bcg kg-1 and 0.59 \u03bcg kg-1, respectively. The results\nshowed that DON presented spatial structure whilst OTA was randomly distributed in space.\nThis difference between DON and OTA probably reflected the fact that DON is produced in the\nfield, whereas OTA is produced in storage. The presence of spatial structure for DON implies\nthat sampling plans need to consider the location of sample points in addition to the number of\npoints sampled in order to obtain reliable estimates of quantities such as the mean\ncontamination.\nKeywords\nGeostatistical analysis; deoxynivalenol; ochratoxin A; bulk; cereals.\nIntroduction\nDesigning sampling plans for mycotoxins is particularly problematical because of the\nheterogeneous distribution of these contaminants in bulk lots of different commodities\n(Stroka et al., 2004, Schatzki 1995a and 1995b and Jewers et al., 1988). For example,\ncontamination within a lot may result from a very small proportion of grains or kernels\ncontaining high concentrations of the mycotoxin. Because of the heterogeneous nature of\nmycotoxins, the problems lead to uncertainty over both how many samples to take and how\nto decide on the sampling positions. Normal practice is to aggregate incremental samples\ntaken from a bulk commodity and test a subsample to estimate the mean concentration of the\nmycotoxin. As a result, information on the spatial variability and distribution of the\nmycotoxin is lost.\nExtensive work on mycotoxin sampling has been carried out by the group of Whitaker\n(Whitaker and Wiser, 1969; Whitaker et al., 1994; Whitaker et al., 1998; Whitaker et al.,\n2000; Whitaker, 2003; Whitaker, 2004; Whitaker, 2006). These studies concentrate on the\nrelative magnitude of errors relating to sampling and the processing of samples but they\n2provide little or no information on the interaction between the spatial distribution of the\nmycotoxin and the strategy used to take samples from bulk. It is usually assumed that the\nsamples are independent, but this may not be the case if spatial structure is present.\nIf spatial autocorrelation is present, it is necessary to design sampling programmes\nthat take the spatial distribution into account, to reduce the probability of falsely classifying a\nbatch below or above the acceptance level (Macarthur et al., 2006). For example, hot spots of\ndeoxynivalenol (DON) found in wheat may differ from other mycotoxins in wheat or other\ncommodities because it is mainly generated in the field rather than in storage, which may\nhave an effect on its distribution in subsequent storage and transport the mycotoxin is\ndistributed on a loaded truck. Sampling methods must be both representative and practicable\n(Stroka et al., 2004) so the error associated with the sampling protocol selected is reduced\n(Whitaker, 2006).\nA few studies have looked at the effect that sample size has on determining the mean\nconcentration of DON and ochratoxin A (OTA) in a bulk commodity based on individual\nincremental samples (e.g. Biselli et al., 2005). Other studies have looked at how aggregation\ncan be characterised using a variety of statistics. For example, Oerke et al. (2006) computed\nLloyd\u2019s index of patchiness for the incidence of several Fusarium species in a wheat field.\nLloyd\u2019s index tests distributions of counts for their similarity to a Poisson distribution, and\ndoes not consider the distance between samples. Similarly, Wilhelm and Jones (2005)\ncompared frequency distributions of Fusarium head blight incidence in fields with binomial\nand \u03b2-binomial distributions at scales from 1 m to mesoscale (several counties). Agreement\nwith the \u03b2-binomial would indicate greater aggregation. They also performed lag correlation\ntests using Moran\u2019s I, which was one of the first measures of spatial autocorrelation to be\ndeveloped. Slight non-randomness and autocorrelation were seen at some scales in some\ncases. Schmale et al. (2005), studying spore deposition, had insufficient data points to use lag\ncorrelation measures, so applied nonparameteric methods (SADIE statistics and Mantel tests),\nwhile noting that the data sets were small even for these methods, and found that spore counts\nabove the canopy were usually random, but deposition counts were often aggregated.\nHowever, these approaches give only limited consideration, if any, to the relationship\nbetween distance and autocorrelation, and have all considered field data, rather than bulk\ncommodities.\nGeostatistics is a branch of statistical science that deals with the spatial structure of\nthe variables under study and has the advantage over other methodologies of accounting for\nthe spatial autocorrelation of the sampled variable, in this case mycotoxin concentration. In\ngeostatistics the spatial variation is considered random and is modelled through a stochastic\nprocess. Geostatistics is based on the variogram calculation, a plot that relates the distance\nbetween any two sampled points with their semivariance. Effective and efficient sampling\nstrategies can be designed through the characterisation of the variogram parameters: the\nrange, the sill and the nugget. Examples of studies where the variogram was used to analyse\nthe spatial pattern of diseases are provided by Orum et al. (1999) and Rekah et al. (1999).\nThe former used the variogram to determine the trends and distribution of the aflatoxigenic\nspecies Aspergillus flavus in soil. The latter used it to study the spatial pattern of fusarium\ncrown and root rot in tomatoes.\nGeostatistics has also been used as a tool to investigate the spatial dynamics of plant\ndisease propagation. Chellemi et al. (1988) used geostatistics to examine the spatial pattern of\na population of plant pathogens and diseased plants. Stein et al. (1994) applied geostatistics\nfor the analysis of the spatio-temporal pattern of downy mildew pathogen (Peronospora\nparasitica) in cabbage to predict the disease at any point in time, to develop optimal sampling\npatterns for future assessments, to calculate the expansion rate of the disease and to determine\nthe source of the initial inoculum in space and time. Gottwald et al. (1996) analysed the\n3spatial, temporal and spatio-temporal dynamics of citrus tristeza virus (CTV) in Valencia\n(Spain) to determine the likely rates of disease increase and spread.\nAs part of a project for the UK Food Standards Agency, six different sources of data\nwere obtained through the literature review and personal contact (Parsons et al, 2007). Table\n1 shows a description of each of the data sets considered for analysis. Each set of data was\nfirst assessed for its suitability for geostatistical analysis based on the number of points\navailable for the analysis. Webster and Oliver (1992) suggest that variograms computed with\nfewer than 50 data points are of little value and that at least 100 points are needed for a soil\nvariable to be analysed. The only reference on the number of points required for the\nvariogram calculation of mycotoxins is provided by Stein et al. (1994) who determined that\n49 observations were necessary to estimate the spatial variogram of downy mildew pathogen\nin cabbage. Similar requirements would be expected for DON. Those data sets with fewer\nthan 50 points were not considered for analysis. Of the six data sources, only the one\ncollected by Biselli et al. (2005) was for mycotoxins in grain and contained sufficient data\npoints with their coordinates.\nThis study focuses on using a geostatistical approach to characterise the spatial\ndistribution of DON and OTA in the data collected by Biselli et al. (2005).\nMethod\nData set\nThe data set contained DON and OTA results obtained from a 26 t lot of wheat on a truck in\nGermany. The truck was 2.5 m wide and 10 m long. The data were recorded from 100 points\nat 20 x 5 grid positions at 0.5 m spacing in the horizontal plane through the truck, using a 5\naperture probe sampler. The probe was vertically inserted into the load in the centre of each\ngrid cell to take a single incremental sample containing grain from 5 depths. Each\nincremental sample was mixed and subsampled before the DON and OTA concentrations\nwere measured (Biselli et al., 2005). Thus the final sets of values described the DON and\nOTA concentrations in a two dimensional horizontal plane aggregated over the depth of the\nlorry.\nGeostatistical approach\nGeostatistics describes the spatial autocorrelation among sampled points based on the semi-\nvariogram, a plot that relates the distance between any two points in the space with their\nsemivariance (Figure 1). The semi-variogram shows how similar any two points separated by\na distance h are: if the semivariance is small, the points are closely correlated. The distance h\nis known as the lag distance or lag. Each variogram is characterised by three parameters\nknown as the range, the sill and the nugget (Figure 1). The range is the distance at which the\nspatial autocorrelation between any two points is lost. The sill is the semi-variance value that\ncorresponds to the range. The nugget is the intrinsic variance of the data (e.g. measurement\nand sampling error).\nThe geostatistical analysis included three phases: (i) data preparation, (ii) variogram\ncalculation and (iii) analysis of the spatial structure. Appendix 1 provides a more detailed\nexplanation of the methodology.\nThe selected data set was prepared for geostatistical analysis. The methods require\nthat the data are normally distributed and stationary, that is they do not exhibit spatial trends.\nFor this purpose, the data were analysed for linear and quadratic trends in the coordinate\nvariables. The data set was considered to present a trend if the model explained more than\n420% of the variance. Normality was tested visually by plotting the histogram, box plot\n(showing median, quartiles, extremes and outliers), and Q-Q plot (quantile-quantile plot,\nwhich should be a straight line for a normal distribution). The skewness and kurtosis (Kenney\nand Keeping, 1961) were calculated. The normal distribution has a skewness of 0 and a\nkurtosis of 3. If the data do not have an approximately normal distribution, they may be\ntransformed using one of a range of standard transformations to give a close approximation to\nnormality (Webster and Oliver, 2000; Sokal and Rohlf, 1995).\nThe empirical variogram was calculated in 4 directions defined by azimuth 0\uf0b0, 90\uf0b0,\n45\uf0b0 and 315\uf0b0 to detect anisotropy (differences in the variogram depending on direction).\nAzimuth 0\uf0b0 was along the axis of the truck facing forward and angles were measured\nclockwise in the horizontal plane. The lag distance, azimuth tolerance and maximum distance\nof analysis were selected according to the results obtained from a sensitivity analysis on these\nvariables. The exponential and spherical models (Webster and Oliver, 2000) were used for\nthe fitting of the variogram. The spatial structure of the mycotoxin was assessed according to\nthe sill, range and nugget values obtained for each variogram.\nResults\nThe OTA data were strongly skewed with mode 0 and therefore could not be transformed to a\nnormal distribution. They were fitted by an exponential distribution with mean 0.57 \u03bcg kg-1\nand standard deviation of 1.13 (Figure 2). Table 2 summarises the descriptive statistics\nobtained for OTA. The variogram was calculated by treating OTA as an indicator\n(present\/absent) variable. The results showed a pure nugget variogram: that is, there was no\nevidence of spatial structure. Figure 3a shows the distribution of OTA in space: OTA\npresented a random spatial distribution of foci of contamination which is consistent with the\nvariogram results obtained.\nThe DON data were log transformed (natural log) to meet the normality requirement;\nTable 2 summarises the descriptive statistics of the original and transformed data. The\nskewness and kurtosis for the transformed data were close to 0 and 3 respectively, which\nindicated that the assumption of normality could be accepted. Figure 3c shows the spatial\ndistribution of the log transformed values of DON concentration. In the trend analysis, the\nlinear model accounted for 2.2% of the variance and the quadratic model accounted for\n18.9%, which were both below the level at which the data would be considered to present a\ntrend.\nThe minimum distance between points in the data set was 0.5 m, due to the sampling\nscheme. The sensitivity analysis on the lag distance showed that a lag distance of 0.7 m\nprovided a good compromise between the number of pairs of points for each lag distance and\nthe number of points in the variogram.\nThe anisotropy analysis showed that the variogram calculated with azimuth tolerance\n60\uf0b0 was significantly different along (azimuth 0\uf0b0) and across the truck (azimuth 90\uf0b0). A\nsecond analysis was carried out to determine if the anisotropy was due to differences in the\nspatial pattern of DON or lack of points to compute the variogram across the sampled area.\nThe results showed that the number of pairs of data points per lag distance was significantly\nsmaller when calculating the variogram for azimuth 90\uf0b0: the apparent anisotropy was an\nartefact of the smaller number of points across the truck. Therefore, the omnidirectional\nvariogram was used.\nThe maximum number of pairs of data points for each lag distance was reached at\nabout 4 m for the majority of the azimuths when analysing the longitudinal direction. This\nindicated that the maximum distance of analysis for the variogram should be around 4 m. The\n5final omnidirectional variogram was calculated with lag distance step 0.7 m and maximum\ndistance 4 m. The spherical model was found to fit better than the exponential.\nThe results obtained (Figure 4) showed that there was spatial correlation for DON\nconcentration in the selected batch. The variogram was defined by a 4.35 m range, a 0.07 sill\nand a 0.013 nugget. The non-zero nugget indicates that there was a small amount of variation\nthat either was not captured by the sampling strategy applied or was intrinsic to the\nmeasurements of DON concentration. The variogram sill is generally assumed to be equal to\nthe variance of the population (Barnes, 1991). The sill was consistent with the variance\n(0.055) obtained from the standard deviation in Table 2.\nDiscussion\nThis study was the first application of geostatistical analysis to data on mycotoxin\ncontamination of bulk agricultural\/food commodities. Previous studies have used statistics\nsuch as the Moran\u2019s I, SADIE and Mantel\u2019s tests and the dispersion index (Wilhelm and\nJones, 2005 and Schmale, 2005) to try to detect non-random distributions of fungi or\nmycotoxins. Most of these ignore the spatial component. Geostatistics provides an explicit\ncharacterisation of spatial autocorrelation, so is capable of quantifying effects that would not\nbe detected by other methods. Geostatistics also allows prediction of the value of the variable\nunder study at non measured locations using interpolation techniques such as kriging.\nThe data set came from a truck load of wheat that was selected for sampling because a\nhigh level of contamination was found. The results for this need, therefore, to be treated with\ncaution when attempting to generalise to other situations.\nThe data set showed clear evidence of spatial structure for DON, but none for OTA.\nThis difference may reflect the fact that DON is mainly produced in the field by a widespread\norganism, whereas OTA is typically produced in localised \u2018hot spots\u2019 in storage, but this\nneeds to be tested in other data sets, including other commodities. Biselli et al. (2005), using\nclassical statistics, also found that the OTA was present in hot spots and had higher\nvariability than DON.\nThe analysis of the DON data set showed that there was a significant spatial\ncorrelation to the distribution of DON mycotoxins in stored grain. The presence of spatial\nstructure implies that samples cannot always be assumed to be independent and that sampling\nplans need to consider the location of sample points in addition to the number of points\nsampled in order to obtain reliable estimates of quantities such as the mean contamination\nand the variance.\nThe spatial pattern was lost for lag distances greater than 4 m. If this is typical, it has\ntwo different implications for sampling, depending on its purpose. If the intention were to\ncharacterise the spatial variation, sampling strategies with larger spacing would not detect it.\nConversely, points closer than 4 m apart would be autocorrelated, introducing errors or biases\ninto the calculation of sample statistics. Further research should quantify the benefit of\nsampling protocols that account for the spatial structure of the mycotoxin when determining\nlevels of contamination to minimise these errors.\nSurveillance sampling always aggregates the incremental samples before analysis, so\nall information about the distribution of contaminants is lost. In order to provide better data\nfor the design of sampling protocols and risk management, there is a need for more good\nquality data sets in which the incremental samples are analysed and recorded separately.\nFurthermore, in order to determine the importance of spatial structure in mycotoxins and its\npotential effect on sampling, experimental sampling should be based on regular grids and\nrecord the sample coordinates. On the basis of experience in soil sampling, data sets should\n6contain of the order of 100 points or more (Webster and Oliver, 2000; Webster and Oliver,\n1992).\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was funded by the Food Standards Agency Project CO3055. We wish to thank Dr.\nScarlett Biselli (EUROFINS, Hamburg, Germany) for giving permission to use the data analysed\nhere.\nAppendix\nGeostatistics is based on the variogram model which relates the distance between any two\npoints in the space with their semivariance. Consider a transect along which observations of a\nvariable Z are taken at regular intervals. The positions are denoted as xi and the value of the\nobservation is z(xi), i= 1,2\u2026n. The variance of the differences between all the pairs of points\nat a lag distance h apart can be calculated as follows:\n\uf0e5\n\uf03d\n\uf02b\uf02d\uf03d\n)(\n1\n2))()((\n)(\n1\n)(\nhm\ni\nii hxzxzhm\nh\uf067 (1)\nwhere m(h) is the number of pairs of data points separated by lag distance h and \uf067(h) is the\naverage variance of all pairs of data points separated by lag distance h. The per-observation\nvariance or semi-variance )(\u02c6 h\uf067 is half the variance )(h\uf067 .\nThe semi-variance is a measure of the similarity between points at a given lag\ndistance. The smaller the semi-variance, the more alike the points are. The graph of semi-\nvariance against lag distance is the experimental semi-variogram (Figure 1). The semi-\nvariogram shows how similar any two points separated by a lag distance h are. In general, the\ncloser any two points are, the more similar their value is. In the empirical semi-variogram the\nsemi-variance increases with lag distance up to a distance a, called the range, at which the\nsemi-variance remains constant. The range is the point at which the autocorrelation between\npoints becomes 0 and marks the limit of spatial dependence: points further apart are spatially\nindependent. The semi-variance value at the range is called the sill (c). The sill is the\nmaximum of the empirical semi-variogram and is the a priori variance, \uf0732, of the process.\nThe semi-variance at lag distance 0 is called the nugget (c0) and identifies the measurement\nerror and the variations that occur over lag distances less than the shortest sampling interval\n(Webster and Oliver, 2000). The sill, the range and the nugget are the three parameters that\ncharacterise the semi-variogram.\nThe model fitted to the experimental semi-variogram is called the empirical semi-\nvariogram (Figure 1) and is a simplification of the experimental variogram. The model is\nfitted using one of the \u2018authorised\u2019 functions (Webster and Oliver, 2000). The spherical\n(equation 2) or exponential (equation 3) functions are two of the most frequently used models\nin geostatistics so these models were selected for the variogram fitting in this study. The\nfitting of the model was done using ordinary least squares.\n\uf0ef\uf0ee\n\uf0ef\uf0ed\n\uf0ec\n\uf03e\uf02b\n\uf0a3\uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\uf02d\uf02b\uf03d\nahcc\nah\na\nh\na\nh\ncch\nfor\nfor\n2\n1\n2\n3\n)(\u02c6\n0\n3\n0\uf067 (2)\n7\uf028 \uf029\uf028 \uf029\n\uf0ee\n\uf0ed\n\uf0ec\n\uf03e\uf02b\n\uf0a3\uf02d\uf02b\uf03d\nahrc\nahrhcc\nh\nfor\nfor\/exp1\n)(\u02c6\n0\n0\uf067 (3)\nwhere co is the nugget, c is the sill, a is the range, h is the lag distance and r is a distance\nparameter that defines the spatial extent of the model. The exponential model approaches its\nsill asymptotically and therefore, does not have a finite range. Generally, r or effective range\nis assumed to be the lag distance at which the semi-variance equals 95% of the sill variance,\nwhich is approximately 3r.\nThese definitions extend to the case of two-dimensional data by measuring the lag\ndistance h in all directions instead of along the transect. However, even if the data are\nsampled using a regular grid, the distances between points are not all multiples of the grid\nsize, because all possible pairs of points are considered, not just those lying on the same row\nor column. In this case, the semi-variance for a given lag distance is estimated by using all\nthe points separated by distances within a certain tolerance of the required lag distance. In\neffect, the lag distance axis of the variogram is divided into a series of discrete intervals\nwhose width is the lag tolerance.\nFor the empirical semi-variogram model to be fitted accurately it is necessary to have\nsufficient points in the experimental semi-variogram, but for the semi-variance value to be\naccurate requires sufficient pairs of observations contributing to each point. Increasing the lag\ntolerance will reduce the first of these, but increase the second. Therefore, the choice of\ntolerance is a compromise between the accuracy of model fitting and the accuracy of the\nestimation of the semi-variance.\nIt is also possible to consider the effect of direction within a two-dimensional data set,\nby considering pairs of points separated from one another at a specific angle (for example at\n45\uf0b0 to the grid rows). The angle relative to some reference direction is called the azimuth. If\nthe variograms differ with azimuth, the data are said to be anisotropic or to present\nanisotropy. For example, the spatial structure of contamination in a wheat field might differ\nparallel and perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction or the tramline direction. In a\nsimilar way to lag tolerance, the points included for each azimuth are defined by the azimuth\ntolerance. If the azimuth tolerance is 180\uf0b0, all directions are included and the variogram is\nsaid to be omnidirectional.\nThe number of points used to estimate each point in the variogram depends on the lag\ntolerance, as described above, and similarly on the azimuth tolerance. It may also depend on\nthe azimuth itself, either because the sample space has different extents in each direction, or\nbecause of the geometry of the sampling grid. Finally, there is a maximum distance beyond\nwhich the number of pairs decreases significantly. A sensitivity analysis may be carried out\nto quantify the effects of these four parameters.\nFor the geostatistical analysis to be effective the variable under study must be\nnormally distributed, second-order stationary and must present no trend. Data that are not\nnormally distributed may be transformed to achieve normality. A second-order stationary\nprocess is characterised by a mean, variance and covariance that depend only on the\nseparation between points and not on their absolute positions. A systematic component in the\nspatial variation is an indication of a trend. The trend must be removed from the data when\nidentified so the geostatistical analysis is only carried out for the residuals after subtracting\nthe trend.\nReferences\nBarnes RJ. 1991.
