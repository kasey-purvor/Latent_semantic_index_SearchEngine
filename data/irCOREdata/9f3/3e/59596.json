Paraglacial landscape readjustment may have also been enhanced by episodic \nseismic activity linked to glacio-isostatic unloading. In the inner fjord, evidence of Holocene \nmass failure includes the Ardessie debris lobe and a discrete intact slide block preserved within \nthe postglacial basinal deposits. The former is a localised accumulation linked to a fluvial \ncatchment on the adjacent An Teallach massif. These mass transport deposits may represent an \nongoing response to paraglacial processes, albeit much reduced (relative to the major slides) in \nterms of sediment supply to the fjord. \n \nIntroduction \n \nIt is well established that fjords are areas of major landslide activity due to their steep lateral \nslopes, characteristically high rates of sedimentation, and commonly exceptional rates of isostatic \nuplift (Syvitski & Shaw 1995; Hampton et al. 1996). These factors make them ideal \nenvironments for all kinds of sediment deformation, be it due to gravitational reworking of the \nrapidly accumulating deposits, fluid flow or to external stimuli, such as earthquakes. Examples of \nsediment slides, slumps, and extensional and compressional deformation structures are to be \nfound in fjords worldwide, including Canada (Syvitski & Hein 1991), East Greenland \n(Whittington & Niessen 1997; Niessen & Whittington 1997) and Norway (Aarseth et al. 1989; \nHjelstuen et al. 2009).  \n  \nScotland\u2019s fjords are no exception. Recent work in the Summer Isles region of NW Scotland \n(Fig. 1) has identified an up to 100 m thick sequence of fjord sediments, which was rapidly \n 2\n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n66 \n67 \n68 \n69 \ndeposited during the landward retreat of the ice margin from the Summer Isles into the present-\nday sea lochs of Loch Broom and Little Loch Broom (Stoker et al. in press). Swath bathymetric \nimagery, high-resolution seismic reflection profiles and sediment core data have shown that mass \nfailure is pervasive throughout the Summer Isles region. Regional mapping has demonstrated that \nearly, post-depositional deformation in and around Loch Broom, including the Cadail Slide (Fig. \n1), occurred during the Lateglacial interval (Stoker et al. 2006, in press; Stoker & Bradwell \n2009). In this paper we focus on one of the largest areas of submarine mass failure yet to be \nidentified in nearshore UK waters \u2013 herein referred to as the Little Loch Broom Slide Complex \n(Fig. 1). We also describe more localised features of instability in the inner part of Little Loch \nBroom, including the Badcaul Slide and the Ardessie debris lobe; the latter most probably a \nHolocene feature. We use geophysical and geological data to describe the style of the instability \nand the nature of the resulting sediments, as well as to provide constraints on the timing of \nfailure. Considered together with the regional pattern of neotectonic deformation, the \ndevelopment of the Little Loch Broom Slide Complex and adjacent mass failures may provide \nclues as to the stability of the deglaciating Scottish hinterland during the Lateglacial\u2013Holocene \ninterval. \n \nRegional Setting \n \nLittle Loch Broom is a NW trending sea loch situated approximately 10 km west of Ullapool \n(Fig. 1). The flanks of the loch are characterised by rugged headlands backed by mountains, such \nas An Teallach to the south, and Beinn Ghoblach to the north. The loch is 12 km long, 0.5 to 2.0 \nkm wide, and is divided more or less at its mid-point into inner and outer basins by a mid-loch \n 3\n70 \n71 \n72 \n73 \n74 \n75 \n76 \n77 \n78 \n79 \n80 \n81 \n82 \n83 \n84 \n85 \n86 \n87 \n88 \n89 \n90 \n91 \n92 \nsill (~25 m below sea level). The deepest part of the loch is the inner basin (119 m), while the \nouter basin reaches a maximum depth of 65 m (Stoker et al. 2006). Slope angles are also greater \nin the inner loch (locally >50\u00b0) compared to the outer loch (locally up to 25\u00b0). No detailed \nhydrographic survey from Little Loch Broom has been published; however, the Scottish \nEnvironmental Protection Agency site data report for the loch (SEPA 2006) states that it is \nprotected from SW winds, but exposed to winds blowing from the NW. Heath et al. (2000) used \ndata from Lee and Ramster\u2019s Atlas of the Sea (1981) to estimate a mean spring tidal current of 1-\n2 ms-1 in both Loch Broom and Little Loch Broom. The approximate average flushing time for \nthe whole loch is 7 days, although the deeper basins take longer, and freshwater input is generally \nlow (SEPA 2006).  \n \nThe depth to bedrock in Little Loch Broom is locally up to 160 m (maximum) below OD, in the \ninner loch. The bedrock geology is dominated by Neoproterozoic Torridonian sandstone with \nsporadic inliers of Archaean gneiss near the mouth of the loch. The orientation of the loch is \nstructurally controlled by a fault that trends along the length of Little Loch Broom (Fig. 1). \nSignificant NE trending structures in the area include the Moine Thrust and the Coigach fault. \n \nThe regional glacial geology of the Summer Isles area is summarised in Figure 2 and Table 1; for \ndetails see Stoker et al. in press. All dates have been calibrated (Fairbanks et al. 2005) and are \nexpressed as calendar years (ka BP). The major part of the succession records a time-\ntransgressive landward retreat of the Lateglacial ice-sheet margin from The Minch, across the \nSummer Isles, back to the sea lochs of Loch Broom and Little Loch Broom. The deposition of \nice-contact to ice proximal glacimarine and ice-distal glacimarine facies, assigned to the Assynt \n 4\n93 \n94 \n95 \n96 \n97 \n98 \n99 \n100 \n101 \n102 \n103 \n104 \n105 \n106 \n107 \n108 \n109 \n110 \n111 \n112 \n113 \n114 \n115 \nGlacigenic and Annat Bay Formations, respectively, comprise the bulk of the sediment infilling \nthe fjord region. Cosmogenic-isotope surface-exposure ages of boulders from onshore moraines \nwithin the Assynt Glacigenic Formation, combined with AMS radiocarbon dating of marine \nshells from, and micropalaeontological analysis of, both the Assynt Glacigenic and Annat Bay \nFormations in offshore sediment cores all suggest that these units were deposited largely between \nabout 14 and 13 ka BP, i.e. during the Lateglacial Interstadial (Bradwell et al. 2008; Stoker et al. \nin press). In Loch Broom, there is evidence of late-stage oscillation of outlet glacier lobes back \ninto the fjord; this correlates with several discrete Late-stage members of the Assynt Glacigenic \nFormation. An associated series of large fan-deltas comprise the Ullapool Gravel Formation, \nwhich is sandwiched between these Late-stage members. As the fjord gradually became ice free, \nthe Outer and Inner Loch Broom shell beds accumulated as a time-transgressive deposit on the \nfloor of the fjord. The Inner Loch Broom shell bed is overlain by glacial diamicton belonging to \none of the Late-stage members of the Assynt Glacigenic Formation in the inner loch. This \nrelationship provides an age constraint of <13 ka BP for the late-stage ice-margin oscillation \nwithin the inner fjord. A discrete lithogenetic unit, informally named the \u2018Late-stage debris \nflows\u2019, occurs sporadically throughout the Summer Isles region. This unit post-dates the Assynt \nGlacigenic and Annat Bay Formations, but pre-dates the Summer Isles Formation, which forms a \ncover of Holocene marine sediments deposited after about 8 ka BP.  \n \nThe Assynt Glacigenic, Annat Bay and Summer Isles Formations, together with the Late-stage \ndebris flow lithogenetic unit, have all been mapped in and around the inner part of Little Loch \nBroom (Fig. 3). In contrast, the shallower, outer part of the loch is dominated almost completely \nby the Assynt Glacigenic Formation, and its reworked upper component assigned to the \n 5\n116 \n117 \n118 \n119 \n120 \n121 \n122 \n123 \n124 \n125 \n126 \n127 \n128 \n129 \n130 \n131 \n132 \n133 \n134 \n135 \n136 \n137 \n138 \nRireavach Member; these units are overlain by a seismically unresolvable Holocene veneer \n(Stoker et al. in press) (Figs 2 & 3). The mid-loch sill that separates the inner and outer lochs is \nformed by a coincidence of a bedrock high and a major moraine ridge associated with the Assynt \nGlacigenic Formation. Other prominent moraine ridges also belonging to this unit are preserved \non sills at the mouth (outer loch moraine) and near the head (inner loch moraine) of the loch. \nFrom a stratigraphic perspective, the Rireavach Member defines the reworked extent of the \nAssynt Glacigenic Formation within the confines of the Little Loch Broom Slide Complex. \nAdditional mass transport deposits are associated with the Late-stage debris flow unit, linked to \nthe Badcaul Slide, and with the Summer Isles Formation, including the Ardessie debris lobe. \n \nMethods \n \nThis study combines geophysical and geological data collected by the British Geological Survey \n(BGS) and the Scottish Association for Marine Science (SAMS) in the Summer Isles region \nbetween 2005 and 2007. A marine geophysical survey of the Summer Isles region, including \nLittle Loch Broom, was undertaken in July 2005, and acquired multibeam swath bathymetry and \nhigh-resolution seismic reflection data (Stoker et al. 2006). Bathymetric data were acquired using \na GeoSwath system operating at 125 kHz, mounted on a retractable bow pole on the R\/V \nCalanus. Swath survey lines were traversed at a spacing of 200 m, thereby enabling swath \noverlap and full coverage bathymetry across an area of 225 km2. The data were collected on a \nGeoSwath computer with post-acquisition processing carried out on a separate workstation. \nOutput was in the form of xyz data with a typical grid spacing of 3 m. The grid was converted \ninto a depth-coloured shaded-relief image using Fledermaus (processing and visualisation \n 6\n139 \n140 \n141 \n142 \n143 \n144 \n145 \n146 \n147 \n148 \n149 \n150 \n151 \n152 \n153 \n154 \n155 \n156 \n157 \n158 \n159 \n160 \n161 \nsoftware). The shaded-relief image of the study area is shown in Figure 4. The seismic reflection \ndata were acquired using a BGS-owned Applied Acoustics surface-towed boomer and \nhydrophone. Fifty-seven boomer profiles (a total length of about 235 km) were collected across \nthe region, including twelve profiles specifically acquired in Little Loch Broom. The data were \nrecorded and processed (Time Varied Gain, Bandpass Filter 800\u2013200 Hz) on a CODA DA200 \nseismic acquisition system and output as SEG-Y and TIFF format. Further technical details of the \ngeophysical data collection are outlined in Stoker et al. (2006).  \n \nOn the basis of regional measurements of superficial sediments offshore Scotland, sound \nvelocities in the fjord sediment fill are taken to be in the range of 1500\u20132000 ms-1 depending \nupon their composition and degree of induration (McQuillin & Ardus 1977; Stoker et al. 1994). \nIn this paper, the conversion of sub-bottom depths from milliseconds to metres has been \ngenerally taken as a maximum estimate (e.g. 20 ms two-way travel time (TWTT) \u226420 m) of \nsediment thickness. The relief of features with expression at the sea bed is based on the sound \nvelocity in water of 1450 ms-1 (Hamilton 1985). \n \nGeological calibration of the geophysical data was established using SAMS gravity cores GC087, \n088, 092, 093, 112, 113, 115, 120 and 122, and BGS vibrocore 57-06\/286 (a re-occupation of site \nGC122) (Fig. 4). The SAMS cores were collected from the M\/V Calanus in August 2006, \nwhereas the BGS core was collected in September 2007, using the R\/V James Cook. Stratigraphic \ncorrelation of these cores is based on a regional study of all cores collected in the Summer Isles \nregion (a total of 50 sample stations), which is detailed in Stoker et al. (in press). The lithology of \nthe cores is summarised in Table 2. \n 7\n162 \n163 \n164 \n165 \n166 \n167 \n168 \n169 \n170 \n171 \n172 \n173 \n174 \n175 \n176 \n177 \n178 \n179 \n180 \n181 \n182 \n183 \n184 \n \nIndicators of instability in outer Little Loch Broom \n \nLittle Loch Broom Slide Complex \n \nThe Little Loch Broom Slide Complex extends between the mid- and outer loch moraine\/bedrock \nsills (Figs 3\u20135a). In this area, the maximum water depth is approximately 75 m. The sea bed in \nthe centre of the outer loch is flat, whereas much of the rest of the basin is characterised by \nundulating bathymetry and an irregular, scalloped margin (Fig. 5a). On this basis, three main \nareas of sliding have been identified, designated the Rireavach, Carnach and Scoraig slides, with \na further area of debris lobes offshore Corran Scoraig, near the outer sill. The morphology of \nthese features is detailed below, together with the resultant deposits, which collectively comprise \nthe Rireavach Member (Assynt Glacigenic Formation). \n \nRireavach Slide.    This slide is the largest feature identified in Little Loch Broom, and has \naffected an area of the sea bed about 1\u20132 km2 (Fig. 5a). Three distinct scarp surfaces (1\u20133) are \nobserved on the swath image, confirmed by their correlation with the boomer profile that \ntransects the slide (Fig. 3b). The most distinctive backscarp (1) displays a generally rectilinear \nmargin, at a water depth of about 35 to 40 m, that can be traced around the entire area of the \nslide, a distance of about 4 km, and defines two main erosional hollows or re-entrants: a northern \none (NR) constrained by the side of the loch, and an eastern one (ER) constrained by the \nmorainic rampart that forms the mid-loch sill. These re-entrants indicate that material has been \ndisplaced into the basin in both southerly (NR) and westerly (ER) directions. However, the \n 8\n185 \n186 \n187 \n188 \n189 \n190 \n191 \n192 \n193 \n194 \n195 \n196 \n197 \n198 \n199 \n200 \n201 \n202 \n203 \n204 \n205 \n206 \n207 \nrectilinear shape of the scarp appears to have been modified by smaller scale (\u2264200 m), curved or \nscalloped indentations that impart an irregularity to the backscarp. The southern wall of the loch \nappears to have remained linear, steep and less obviously affected by sliding. Scarps 1\u20133 (in the \neastern re-entrant) range from 7 to 15 m high, with slope angles between 7\u00b0 and 15\u00b0. They \ndisplay sub-planar to predominantly curved, concave-up, profiles. Distinct terraces occur between \nscarps 1\u20132 and 2\u20133, at water depths of about 55 m and 65 m, respectively. The present-day basin \nfloor, at the foot of scarp 3 is at about 75 m water depth. Along the western edge of the northern \nre-entrant (NR), the delineation of the separate scarps is less clear and a single scarp is present, \nwith an upper headwall limit at 30 to 35 m water depth, a vertical relief of 35 m and a slope angle \nup to 10\u00b0. In Figure 3b, the seismic profile shows the basin floor to be slightly undulatory; a \ncharacteristic also observed on the swath image (Fig. 5a). \n \nCarnach Slide.    The Carnach Slide forms a much smaller sea bed hollow on the northern slope \nof the loch, between about 35 and 55 m water depth (Fig. 5a). It occupies an area of about 0.05 \nkm2, has displaced sediment to a depth of about 5 m below sea bed, displays a curved, concave-\nup, profile, with a maximum backscarp slope angle up to about 13\u02da. Downslope of the scar, an \nequivalent area of seabed is raised ~1\u20132 m (convex-up) above the adjacent sea floor for a \ndistance of up to 300m from the foot of the scar. At least two separate lobes are identified from \nthe swath image, which represent material derived from the slide scar.  \n \nScoraig Slide.    The Scoraig Slide is expressed as a discrete crenulate scar that broadly \nparallels the northern slope of the loch for about 500 m (Fig. 5a). The slide scar covers an area \nof about 0.25 km2, and is cut into the slope between about 30 and 65 m water depth. It displays \n 9\n208 \n209 \n210 \n211 \n212 \n213 \n214 \n215 \n216 \n217 \n218 \n219 \n220 \n221 \n222 \n223 \n224 \n225 \n226 \n227 \n228 \n229 \na curved, concave-up, slide surface profile, with a maximum backscarp angle up to 18\u02da. Several \ndebris lobes are visible at the base of the scar, raised ~1-2 m above the sea bed, and extending \n250\u2013300 m into the basin, and up to 600 m along the strike of the basin.   \n \nDebris lobes offshore Corran Scoraig.    Further NW along the northern flank of the outer loch \na series of less well-defined crenulations and hollows are visible on the swath image, some of \nwhich have a gully-like appearance, up to 10 m deep and several tens of metres wide (Fig. 5a). \nA series of overlapping debris lobes up to 4 m in relief and up to several hundred metres wide, \nare found towards the base of the slope forming a package that extends for up to 1.3 km along \nthe axis of the basin. There may also be some input from the southern slope, though the swath \nimage is increasingly restricted (due to operational constraints) in extent near the mouth of the \nloch. On both the swath image and the seismic profile data, the basin floor topography is \nhummocky. \n \nRireavach Member (slide complex deposits).    The Rireavach Member of the Assynt Glacigenic \nFormation forms a discrete fjord slope to basin-floor package of mass transport deposits derived \nfrom multiple slide sources. It has accumulated below about 30 m water depth, the approximate \nupper bounding limit of the headwalls of the slides. On seismic profiles, it displays an irregular, \nhummocky, sheet-like geometry, up to 12 m thick. In Figure 3, the base of the Rireavach Member \n(the base of the slide complex) is clearly depicted by the truncation of acoustically layered strata \nin the underlying, undisturbed deposits of the Assynt Glacigenic Formation. Internally, the mass \ntransport deposits display a predominantly chaotic internal reflection configuration; however, \n 10\n230 \n231 \n232 \n233 \n234 \n235 \n236 \n237 \n238 \n239 \n240 \n241 \n242 \n243 \n244 \n245 \n246 \n247 \n248 \n249 \n250 \n251 \n252 \nsporadic subhorizontal reflections are locally observed, particularly in the area of the Rireavach \nSlide and within the pile of debris lobes off Corran Scoraig, near the mouth of the outer loch.  \n \nThe deposits of the Rireavach Member have been sampled at three sites: GC087, GC119 and \nGC122 (57-06\/286). All three cores are from the basin floor (Figs 4 & 5), and all recovered \ndifferent lithologies (Table 2). Deposits of the Rireavach Slide were tested by core GC087, which \nrecovered 0.62 m of colour laminated silty clay overlying a 0.14 m thick bed of shelly, gravelly, \nsandy mud, in turn overlying homogeneous clay and silty clay. The contacts between all three \nbeds are sharp, and the laminated clay displays angular discordance with the underlying bed. In \nFigure 6a, the laminations are clearly observed to be inclined, relative to the underlying bed of \nsandy mud, and partially disrupted and offset along small faults. The laminated clay is in sharp \ncontact with the overlying Holocene unit, the base of which is marked by a gravelly and shelly \nlag deposit (Fig. 4). Core GC119 is located on the edge of the debris lobes derived from the \nScoraig Slide, where the Rireavach Member contained a 0.2 m thick sandy bed overlying 0.69 m \nof slightly sandy clay. Discrete patches of lithic grains are scattered throughout the clay and \npossibly represent coarser, matrix-supported intraclasts. There is a sharp contact with the \noverlying Holocene sandy mud. Cores GC122 and 57-06\/286 tested the debris lobes off Corran \nScoraig and recovered 2.57 m of massive, compact, reddish brown gravelly sand, the top of \nwhich is reworked and overlain by a veneer of Holocene muddy sand.  \n \nPre-slide deposits (Assynt Glacigenic Formation).    Cores GC112\/113 and 120 are located in the \nslide scar region of the Rireavach and Carnach slides, respectively (Fig. 4). They both recovered \nhomogeneous to colour laminated mud and clay with sporadic pebbles, shelly material and thin \n 11\n253 \n254 \n255 \n256 \n257 \n258 \n259 \n260 \n261 \n262 \n263 \n264 \n265 \n266 \n267 \n268 \n269 \n270 \n271 \n272 \n273 \n274 \n275 \nbeds of muddy sand. The same lithofacies was also present in cores GC093 and GC115, which \npenetrated the Assynt Glacigenic Formation outside of the slide complex; GC093 is located \nadjacent to the major moraine on the mid-loch sill. In all of these cores, this lithofacies is sharply \noverlain by a Holocene shelly and gravelly lag deposit. The colour laminated mud and clay is \ndistinctive of the Assynt Glacigenic Formation throughout the Summer Isles region (Stoker et al. \nin press), and in Little Loch Broom the sediments in these cores are regarded as being part of the \nundisturbed, pre-sliding, fjord section.  \n \nIndicators of instability in inner Little Loch Broom \n \nThe fjord infill succession in inner Little Loch Broom is far less disturbed in comparison to the \nouter loch; this is most probably a function of the steeper sides of the inner loch precluding the \naccumulation of significant sidewall deposits. However, there are several indicators of instability, \nspecifically the Badcaul Slide and associated Late-stage debris flow unit, together with the \nArdessie debris lobe and a discrete slide deposit in core GC088, both of which are associated \nwith the Holocene Summer Isles Formation.  \n \nBadcaul Slide \n \nThe term Badcaul Slide is herein utilised in reference to a 1-km2 diffuse zone of disturbance on \nthe SE side of the mid-loch sill that has affected the Assynt Glacigenic Formation (Figs 3 & 7). \nThe swath image displays a number of terraces with irregular, scalloped, backscarps stepping \ndown into the inner loch. However, the most distinctive terrace, which occurs on the main part of \n 12\n276 \n277 \n278 \n279 \n280 \n281 \n282 \n283 \n284 \n285 \n286 \n287 \n288 \n289 \n290 \n291 \n292 \n293 \n294 \n295 \n296 \n297 \n298 \nthe sill at about 60 m water depth, displays a rectilinear shape up to 800 m wide and backed by a \nheadwall with a slope angle up to 15\u02da, and which is traced for 1.5\u22122 km. A series of narrower \n(about 50 m wide) terraces occur between about 70 and 90 m water depth (Fig. 7). The narrower \nterraces coincide with what appear to be several slide and\/or slump blocks observed on the \nseismic profile. The internal seismic reflection configuration of the Assynt Glacigenic Formation \non this part of the fjord wall is mostly structureless to irregular and chaotic, but with \ndiscontinuous sub-planar reflecting surfaces dipping into the basin that impart a general large-\nscale tabular structure to the depositional package (Fig. 7b). Gently curved, smaller scale, \nconcave-up, slide surfaces are also observed within the upper part of the slide package, and, \nwhere bedding is observed, some rotation of reflections (including the sea bed) into the slope is \nlocally evident (Fig. 7b: upper inset). At the base of the slope, the sea bed occurs at 110 m water \ndepth and is characterised by a hummocky morphology that becomes smoother into the basin. \nThe seismic profile shows that this reflects a large debris lobe that has accumulated at the base of \nthe slope, and which becomes progressively buried beneath younger sediments into the basin \n(Figs 3 & 7b). The debris lobe is up to 10\u201312 m thick, is lensoid in shape with a chaotic internal \nreflection configuration, and can be traced for about 800 m along the line of the profile (Fig. 7b: \nlower inset). This deposit forms part of the Late-stage debris flow lithogenetic unit of Stoker et \nal. (in press). The overlying deposits belong to the Holocene Summer Isles Formation.  \n \nThe debris lobe has been sampled by core GC092, which contained 1.5 m of homogeneous silty \nclay of the Summer Isles Formation, with a slightly sandy base, sharply overlying 0.6 m of \ninterbedded silty clay and muddy sand of the Late-stage debris flow unit. Most of the latter \ndeposit is folded with recumbent isoclinal folds depicted by the paler sandy beds in Figure 6b. It \n 13\n299 \n300 \n301 \n302 \n303 \n304 \n305 \n306 \n307 \n308 \n309 \n310 \n311 \n312 \n313 \n314 \n315 \n316 \n317 \n318 \n319 \n320 \n321 \nis unclear whether or not the basal sandy bed in the core is part of the deformed section; its \ncontact with the overlying interbedded section is sharp. \n \nArdessie debris lobe \n \nThe Ardessie debris lobe has been identified on the southern flank of inner Little Loch Broom, \nimmediately offshore Ardessie, at a water depth of 75\u201380 m (Figs 4 & 5b). The swath image \nshows several gullies, 2\u20135m deep and 20\u201350m wide, eroded into the side of the fjord, on a slope \nangle of 13\u00ba. At the base of the slope, a debris lobe is clearly observed at sea bed, with a convex-\nup relief of up to 2m above the surrounding sea bed and covering an area of approximately 0.2 \nkm2.  Traced landward, the gullies trend back towards the coastline at the point where the Allt \nAirdeasaidh drains into the loch. This stream and its tributaries drain part of the An Teallach \nmassif (Fig. 4), and have a catchment area of approximately 10km2.  \n \nThe debris lobe is similarly well imaged on seismic profile data, which show a discrete lobe at \nthe sea bed with a double hump that may be indicative of several smaller component lobes. The \nhummocky nature of the sea bed associated with the debris lobe contrasts with the generally \nsmoother morphology of the basin floor (Fig. 5b). The seismic profile also reveals an acoustically \nstructureless internal reflection configuration, and that the debris lobe overlies the bulk of the \nbasinal deposits associated with the Summer Isles Formation. In contrast to the Badcaul Slide, \nthere is no indication that the debris lobe is buried beneath any younger sediment (within seismic \nresolution: ~0.5 m). A linear trail of pockmarks, which is associated with shallow gas in the \nbasin, appears to follow the course of a buried, former meltwater channel that retains expression \n 14\n322 \n323 \n324 \n325 \n326 \n327 \n328 \n329 \n330 \n331 \n332 \n333 \n334 \n335 \n336 \n337 \n338 \n339 \n340 \n341 \n342 \n343 \nat the sea bed (Fig. 5b); however, it is unclear whether or not the debris lobe pre- or post-dates \npockmark formation. Although there are no core data available, the seismic stratigraphy indicates \nthat this is a Holocene deposit. \n \nCore GC088 (Summer Isles Formation) \n \nCore GC088 is located close to the southern slope of the inner loch, at a water depth of 102 m. \nThe core penetrated 2.88 m into the Summer Isles Formation, and recovered predominantly soft, \nsticky, homogeneous, mottled silty clay. The seismic profile at the core site shows an undisturbed \nacoustically bedded character; however, the core revealed a discrete bed of folded laminated clay \nbetween 2.32 and 2.75 m (Fig. 6c) in contrast to the enclosing sediment. The deformed \nlamination reveals recumbent folds showing varying degrees of complexity in fold pattern, from \nsymmetrical to asymmetrical isoclinal folds. The contact of the deformed bed with the underlying \nhomogeneous silty clay is sharp; the contact with the overlying bed also appears to be sharp, \nthough there may be some disruption of the top of the bed due to subsequent bioturbation or \nerosion. It seems probable that this is a discrete bed of deformed clay incorporated within the \nmore typical basinal silty clay of the Summer Isles Formation.  \n \nInterpretation and discussion \n \nTypes of mass transport \n \n 15\n344 \n345 \n346 \n347 \n348 \n349 \n350 \n351 \n352 \n353 \n354 \n355 \n356 \n357 \n358 \n359 \n360 \n361 \n362 \n363 \n364 \n365 \n366 \nThe swath bathymetric, seismic reflection and core data provide unambiguous evidence for \nwidespread slope instability within Little Loch Broom, and two main types of mass transport \nprocess can be identified: 1) sliding; and, 2) mass flow (Table 3). These processes are not \nmutually exclusive, as the mass flow deposits are commonly sourced from the adjacent slides, \ne.g. Carnach Slide (Fig. 5a), though the Ardessie debris lobe is a more discrete feature linked to a \nseries of slope gullies. The main characteristics of these two types of mass transport process are \ndescribed below, and summarised in Table 3: \n \nSlides:    A major characteristic of the slide failure surfaces found within the Little Loch Broom \nSlide Complex, as well as the Badcaul Slide, is their curved, concave-up, profile, the morphology \nof which is enhanced on the swath bathymetric image by the scallop shaped nature of the scarps \n(Figs 5 & 7). Tilting of bedding is locally observed in the upper part of the Badcaul Slide mass \ntransport deposit, where bedding is rotated into the failure surfaces (Fig. 7b: upper inset). \nHowever, the swath bathymetry also reveals that this irregular pattern of scarps is superimposed \non a larger-scale rectilinear pattern of failure, as indicated by both the northern and eastern re-\nentrants of the Rireavach Slide, as well as the shallow part of the Badcaul Slide on the mid-loch \nsill. Slides on curved surfaces are classified as slumps, whereby failure is accompanied by \nrotation; in contrast, planar slides are classified as glides, with failure facilitated by translation \n(Nardin et al. 1979; Cook et al. 1982; Mulder & Cochonat 1996). Our data suggest that both \ntranslational and rotational sliding have occurred in Little Loch Broom, the implications of which \nin terms of release mechanisms and timing of mass movement are considered elsewhere in this \nsection.  \n \n 16\n367 \n368 \n369 \n370 \n371 \n372 \n373 \n374 \n375 \n376 \n377 \n378 \n379 \n380 \n381 \n382 \n383 \n384 \n385 \n386 \n387 \n388 \n389 \nProbable slide deposits were recovered in cores GC087 and GC088 from the Rireavach Member \nand Summer Isles Formation, respectively, which proved beds of deformed laminated clay in \nsharp contact with undeformed beds (Figs 4 & 6a, c). The deformed laminations range from \ngently inclined (core GC087) to recumbent and isoclinally folded (core GC088). The abrupt \ncontact with undeformed beds suggests that these beds represent discrete blocks that have moved \ndownslope. Despite some internal deformation they have retained an internal coherency in that \ncontinuous laminations are still preserved. Deformation of the sediment may have begun as \ncreep, which, as gravitational stresses increased, may have ultimately failed as an intact block \n(Syvitski & Shaw 1995). Comparable structures have been described from slide deposits cored on \nthe continental slope offshore Nova Scotia and elsewhere (Cook et al. 1982; Jenner et al. 2007), \nand are commonly attributed to elastic mechanical behaviour of the sediment during submarine \nslope failure (Nardin et al. 1979). As core GC087 did not penetrate the entire mass transport \ndeposit associated with the Rireavach Slide, the possibility that this bed represents a rafted block \nwithin a debris flow cannot be discounted.     \n \nMass flows:    Mounded, lensoid and lobate packages of sediment form the predominant basin \nfloor deposit associated with the Little Loch Broom Slide Complex and the Badcaul Slide, as \nwell as the more discrete Ardessie debris lobe. This depositional morphology, combined with a \ngeneral lack of internal reflectors, is characteristic of mass flow deposits, whereby the absence of \ninternal structure is commonly related to deformational homogenisation of the sediment mass \nduring submarine slope failure (Nardin et al. 1979). The swath bathymetry shows clearly that the \nScoraig and Carnach debris lobes are derived from the adjacent slides, whereas several failure \nsurfaces have contributed to the accumulation of the basinal mass flow package associated with \n 17\n390 \n391 \n392 \n393 \n394 \n395 \n396 \n397 \n398 \n399 \n400 \n401 \n402 \n403 \n404 \n405 \n406 \n407 \n408 \n409 \n410 \n411 \n412 \nthe Rireavach Slide (Fig. 5a). The Late-stage debris flow unit at the foot of the Badcaul Slide is \nsourced from the Badcaul Slide; the deposit gradually thinning into the basin (Fig. 7b).  By way \nof contrast, the Ardessie debris lobe is localised at the base of a series of erosional gulleys that \ntransect the adjacent slope (Fig. 5b). The hummocky surface of many of these mass flow \npackages, as imaged on swath bathymetry or seismic profiles, suggests that each of the main \npackages, which may extend >1 km across the basin floor, consists of an amalgamation of \nsmaller, stacked flows, e.g. the Scoraig and Ardessie debris lobes, that may be up to a maximum \nof a few hundred metres in width. \n \nThe core data suggest that a number of different mass flow processes may have operated during \nslope failure. The occurrence of a clay bed with matrix-supported intraclasts in core GC119, from \na mass flow lobe at the base of the Scoraig Slide (Fig. 4), is consistent with muddy debris-flow \ndeposition, which is associated with plastic mechanical behaviour whereby the strength of the \nflow is principally a result of cohesion due to the clay content (Nardin et al. 1979; Mulder & \nCochonat 1996). In contrast, the massive gravelly sand recovered in cores GC122 and 57-06\/286, \nfrom the area of debris lobes offshore Corran Scoraig (Fig. 4), may be more characteristic of a \ngrain flow (Lowe 1982) or a sandy debris flow (Middleton 1967; Shanmugan 1996), whereby the \nless cohesive sandy material is supported by dispersive pressure, thus exhibiting pseudo-plastic \nflow, and deposited by \u2018freezing\u2019. Although, rapid mass deposition from a high-concentration \nturbidity current \u2013 the Bouma A division \u2013 cannot be discounted, there is no evidence in the cores \nfor grading, which is commonly a defining structure in such deposits (Pickering et al. 1989; \nShanmugan 1996). Whereas debris flows can be initiated and moved along low-angle slopes, \ngrain flows usually require steep slopes for initiation and sustained downslope movement (Nardin \n 18\net al. 1979). All of these sediment types have been described in association with mass flow \nprocesses from continental slopes and fjords (Cook et al. 1982; Syvitski & Hein, 1991; Jenner et \nal. 2007). In core GC092, from the Late-stage debris flow unit, a deformed, folded bed was \npresent at the top of the mass flow lobe, underlain by a sandy bed. The deformed bed is more \ntypical of a slide block, as described above, and in this setting it may represent a rafted block \nincorporated within the mass flow. Unfortunately, no core data are available at this time from the \nArdessie debris lobe. However, its association with erosional gullies implies some kind of \nsediment gravity flow process linked to the formation of the gullies. On continental slopes, such \ngullies are commonly associated with turbidity currents (Pickering et al. 1989). In Little Loch \nBroom, the Ardessie debris lobe and associated gullies appear to represent the sink for part of the \nfluvial catchment area on the northern slope of An Teallach drained by the Allt Airdeasaidh (Fig. \n4); this potential linkage is further discussed below. \n413 \n414 \n415 \n416 \n417 \n418 \n419 \n420 \n421 \n422 \n423 \n424 \n425 \n426 \n427 \n428 \n429 \n430 \n431 \n432 \n433 \n434 \n435 \n \nTiming of mass failure  \n \nA significant phase of mass failure is reported from elsewhere within the Summer Isles region \nbetween about 14 and 13 ka BP, including the Cadail Slide in the North Annat Basin, and \nslumping of basinal sediments in outer Loch Broom (Stoker & Bradwell 2009; Stoker et al. in \npress) (Fig. 1). Seismic-stratigraphy indicates that the Cadail Slide, which also deformed \nsediments of the Assynt Glacigenic Formation, occurred immediately prior to the deposition of \nthe glacimarine Annat Bay Formation in the North Annat Basin. A similar relationship is \nobserved in this study from the Badcaul Slide, where the main package of mass transport deposits \n(of the Assynt Glacigenic Formation) is onlapped by the Annat Bay Formation (Figs 3b & 7b). \n 19\n436 \n437 \n438 \n439 \n440 \n441 \n442 \n443 \n444 \n445 \n446 \n447 \n448 \n449 \n450 \n451 \n452 \n453 \n454 \n455 \n456 \n457 \n458 \nHowever, the Late-stage debris flow unit, also linked to the Badcaul Slide, overlies the Annat \nBay Formation, but is itself onlapped by the Summer Isles Formation. This stratigraphical \nrelationship supports strongly the idea that mass failure in Little Loch Broom (including the Little \nLoch Broom Slide Complex) was initiated during the Lateglacial interval. It also suggests that \nlarge-scale mass flow processes persisted for some time after the deposition of the Annat Bay \nFormation, but are no younger than about 8 ka BP, the onset of deposition of the Summer Isles \nFormation (Stoker et al. in press). A Holocene veneer also overlies the slide and mass flow \ndeposits of the Rireavach Member in outer Little Loch Broom. In contrast, the Ardessie debris \nlobe and the slide deposit in core GC088 are both part of the Summer Isles Formation, and thus \nare of Holocene age. This suggests that discrete areas of mass failure have continued to develop \nin Little Loch Broom within the postglacial interval.   \n \nTriggering mechanism for mass failure, and implications for Lateglacial\u2013Holocene instability in \nthe Summer Isles region \n \nWhen glacier ice occupies a fjord, subglacial sediment and morainic debris are deposited on \nsidewalls, which are commonly very steep. However, during glacier retreat, such sediment-\nmantled slopes become inherently unstable as they lose support during glacial downwasting \n(Church & Ryder 1972; Ballantyne 2002; Powell 2005). Thus, sidewall sediment is prone to \nfailure by gravitational processes soon after the removal of glacier ice (Syvitski 1989; Syvitski & \nShaw 1995; Ballantyne 2002). The walls of Little Loch Broom are no exception; they are locally \nvery steep, exceeding 50\u00b0 on the northern slope of the inner loch close to the mid-loch sill. The \ntriggering of mass failure in Little Loch Broom due to the removal of ice support is consistent \n 20\n459 \n460 \n461 \n462 \n463 \n464 \n465 \n466 \n467 \n468 \n469 \n470 \n471 \n472 \n473 \n474 \n475 \n476 \n477 \n478 \n479 \n480 \n481 \nwith a timing of failure during the Lateglacial interval \u2013 as the depositional environment changed \nfrom an ice-contact\/ice-proximal setting to an ice-distal setting. Arguably, the initial failure on \nboth the Rireavach and Badcaul slides was as rectilinear glide blocks that slid downslope. The \nsub-planar, basinward-dipping reflections in the mass transport package of the Badcaul Slide \nimply a tabular geometry to this sediment package. However, the rectilinear shape of these two \nslides has been subsequently modified by numerous smaller-scale, scallop-shaped failures whose \ncurved surfaces and evidence of bed rotation indicate rotational sliding (slumps). This is also the \ndominant style of the smaller Carnach and Scoraig slides.  \n \nThe time-lag between large-scale slide initiation and subsequent modification by smaller-scale \nslumps is unknown, though the available stratigraphic evidence that has been presented suggests \nthat it had mostly occurred before 8 ka BP. This scenario is consistent with the paraglacial \nconcept of Church & Ryder (1972), who emphasised the relatively rapid adjustment of \ndeglaciated landscapes to nonglacial conditions through the enhanced operation of a wide range \nof processes, including slope failure and mass transport. This essentially involves the progressive \nrelaxation of unstable or metastable elements of the formerly glaciated landscape to a new, more \nstable state (Ballantyne 2002). Although the reason for the change in the style of sliding is \nunclear, we propose the following two-stage process: 1) the planar rupture surfaces associated \nwith the rectilinear slide blocks most likely follow weak bedding layers within the poorly \nconsolidated sediment pile, rendering them highly susceptible to gravity sliding in the early stage \nof deglaciation of the fjord; 2) rotational sliding is less influenced by bedding \u2013 instead, it may \nrelate more to subsequent rupturing of the infill through fractures generated by stress relaxation \nin the later stage of deglaciation. \n 21\n482 \n483 \n484 \n485 \n486 \n487 \n488 \n489 \n490 \n491 \n492 \n493 \n494 \n495 \n496 \n497 \n498 \n499 \n500 \n501 \n502 \n503 \n504 \n \nThe identification of mass transport deposits within the Summer Isles Formation in inner Little \nLoch Broom indicates that paraglacial processes probably continued into the Holocene. The \nrelaxation of the landscape following a widespread glaciation can operate over timescales of \n101\u2212>104 years, although the rate of sediment transfer is greatest immediately after deglaciation \nand probably declines exponentially with time (Ballantyne 2002). On this basis, we infer that this \nLittle Loch Broom fjord region may still not have fully adjusted (in terms of sediment transfer) to \nnonglacial conditions. In particular, the Ardessie debris lobe appears to be a localised, \nanomalous, Holocene, seafloor sediment accumulation linked via a series of slope gullies to part \nof the An Teallach drainage basin. We suggest that the source of the mass flow material is \nreworked glacial deposits on the northern flank of the An Teallach massif, through fluvial \nincision by the Allt Airdeassaidh and its tributaries (Fig. 4).  \n \nParaglacial landscape readjustment may also have been enhanced by episodic seismic activity. \nMass failure linked to glacio-isostatic rebound is a well-established phenomenon along the \nAtlantic continental margin of NW Europe. On the SW Norwegian margin, a detailed study of the \ngiant Storrega Slide concluded that a major seismic pulse most likely accompanied deglaciation \n(Evans et al. 2002; Bryn et al. 2003; Haflidason et al. 2004). Differential rebound following ice \nunloading is also known to reactivate pre-existing structural lineaments and bedrock weaknesses \nas the new stress regime is accommodated, and enhanced neotectonic seismicity along the coastal \nareas of northern, western and southeastern Norway is an established fact (Olesen et al. 2008). In \nthe UK, the earliest postglacial reactivation of pre-existing Caledonian and older lineaments is \nknown to have generated normal faulting with metre-scale displacement in the southern Sperrin \n 22\n505 \n506 \n507 \n508 \n509 \n510 \n511 \n512 \n513 \n514 \n515 \n516 \n517 \n518 \n520 \n521 \n522 \n523 \n524 \n525 \n526 \n527 \nMountains, in Northern Ireland (Knight 1999). Differential rebound and seismicity may also have \nresulted in movement on faults, such as the Kinloch Hourn Fault, in western Scotland (Stewart et \nal. 2001), and possibly caused liquefaction of lake sediments at Glen Roy, in Scotland (Ringrose \n1989). Consequently, it seems probable that palaeoseismic activity was also occurring in the \nSummer Isles region during Lateglacial\u2013Holocene time. This hypothesis is strengthened when it \nis noted that the west coast of Scotland, from Ullapool to Arran, continues to the present-day to \nbe a major focus for earthquakes (Musson 2003). Indeed, Stoker & Bradwell (2009) concluded \nthat earthquake activity was the most likely trigger of slumping and deformation of the basin-\nfloor fjord sediments in outer Loch Broom. It may be no coincidence that all three areas of large-\nscale sediment deformation in the Summer Isles region (North Annat Basin, Loch Broom and \nLittle Loch Broom) are located along lines of NW trending faults (Fig. 1).  \n \nConclusions \n \n\u2022 Swath bathymetry, seismic reflection profiles and sediment core data have revealed evidence 519 \nof extensive slope instability within Lateglacial and Holocene sediments in Little Loch \nBroom. The major area of reworking is in the outer loch where ice-contact\/ice-proximal fjord \ninfill deposits of the Lateglacial Assynt Glacigenic Formation have been extensively \nreworked by sliding and mass flow processes linked to the Little Loch Broom Slide Complex. \nCollectively, this consists of the Rireavach, Carnach and Scoraig slides and associated mass \ntransport deposits \u2013 assigned to the Rireavach Member of the Assynt Glacigenic Formation. \nIn the inner loch, the Badcaul Slide has reworked the Assynt Glacigenic Formation on the \neastern flank of the mid-loch sill, and a major mass flow deposit at the foot of the slope is \n 23\n528 \n529 \n530 \n532 \n533 \n534 \n536 \n537 \n538 \n539 \n540 \n541 \n542 \n543 \n544 \n545 \n547 \n548 \n549 \n550 \nassigned to the Late-stage debris flow lithogenetic unit. Elsewhere in the inner loch, localised \nsliding and mass flow deposition, including the Ardessie debris lobe and an intact slide block \nin core GC088, are preserved in the Holocene Summer Isles Formation. \n\u2022 Regional stratigraphic and isotopic dating evidence suggest that the Little Loch Broom Slide 531 \nComplex and the Badcaul Slide were instigated between 14 and 13 ka BP, and that the bulk \nof the mass failure activity had occurred prior to 8 ka BP. The Ardessie debris lobe and \nGC088 slide-block deposit are both younger than 8 ka BP.  \n\u2022 The sea bed morphology and sub-bottom profiles suggest that both translational and 535 \nrotational sliding mechanisms were active in the generation of the Rireavach and Badcaul \nslides; the superimposition of scalloped-shaped slumps on a larger-scale rectilinear pattern of \nfailure implies that an initial glide phase was superseded by rotational backwall failure. A \nvariety of associated mass transport deposits include intact blocks of laminated clay, and \nmounded mass flow deposits (muddy debris-flow and sandy debris flow or grain-flow \ndeposits) preserved on the floor of the fjord. In contrast, the Holocene Ardessie debris lobe is \na localised, anomalous accumulation in the inner loch that appears to be fed by a series of \ndiscrete slope gullies \u2013 downslope continuations of the Allt Airdeasaidh, which drains part of \nthe An Teallach massif. The intact Holocene slide block in core GC088 implies continuing, \nalbeit sporadic, post-glacial slide activity in the fjord.  \n\u2022 On the basis that the bulk of the mass failure in Little Loch Broom probably occurred 546 \nbetween about 14 and 8 ka BP, we infer that the major trigger of instability is probably the \nresponse of the landscape to deglaciation, immediately following the retreat of the last ice \nsheet. We further suggest that paraglacial landscape readjustment may have been enhanced in \nthis particular region by episodic seismic activity linked to glacio-isostatic unloading along \n 24\n551 \n552 \n553 \n554 \n555 \n556 \n557 \n558 \n559 \n560 \n561 \n562 \n563 \npre-existing geological faults. By way of contrast, the Holocene Ardessie debris lobe may \nrelate to erosion of the drift-mantled northern slopes of the An Teallach massif. This, together \nwith the slide block in core GC088, may represent an ongoing, albeit much reduced, response \nto paraglacial processes in the fjords of NW Scotland.  \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThe authors would like to thank the masters and crew of the R\/V Calanus and R\/V James Cook \nfor their skill and assistance during the collection of the geophysical and geological datasets in \n2005 and 2006.
