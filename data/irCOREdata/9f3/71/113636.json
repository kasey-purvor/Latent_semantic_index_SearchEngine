The literature review suggested a theoretical framework based on \nrelationships between visitors\u2019 mental states and a district\u2019s features. Personal interviews \nemploying Repertory Grid Analysis and Laddering Analysis with the use of photographs of \na historical district in Takayama-shi, Japan were conducted with a sample of Japanese \nstudents. The results illustrate that these methods elucidate issues argued in past studies \nand may be effective in investigating visitors\u2019 evaluation of historical districts.  \n \nKeywords : visitors\u2019 evaluation; historical district; Repertory Grid Analysis; Laddering \nAnalysis \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  4 \nTOWARDS A THEORY OF VISITORS\u2019 EVALUATION OF HISTORICAL \nDISTRICTS AS TOURISM DESTINATIONS: FRAMEWORKS AND METHODS  \nVisitors\u2019 evaluation of historical districts is a complex issue. In addition to the \ngeographical expanse and diversity of places in general, many historical tourism \ndestinations contain both past and contemporary manipulations, the latter often specifically \nfor tourism purposes. This study attempts to explore relationships between visitors\u2019 mental \nstates and the features of historical districts in order to understand the mixed nature of \nvisitors\u2019 evaluation of historical districts as tourism destinations.  \nTHEORETICAL FRAMEWORK \nThe Nature of Historical Districts and Visitors\u2019 Evaluations  \nThe nature of historical districts as tourism destinations can be argued to embrace \nboth touristic and non touristic characteristics. Commercialisation and the existence of \nother people are a part of the complexity of any destination. While heritage sites as tourism \ndestinations provide visitors with opportunities to appreciate the past as their main \nattraction (Lynch, 1972; Millar, 1989; Moscardo, 2000), such places are often \ncommercialised for tourism purposes (Ashworth, 1991; Hewison, 1987; McKercher & du \nCros, 2002). Such commercialisation has come in for criticism from a range of authors \nnotably for transforming historical sites into superficial objects (Boorstin, 1964; \n  5 \nMacCannell, 1976; Mathieson & Wall, 1982). The presence of other people at destinations, \noften as a result of attracting visitors, has also been described as a constraint on visitors\u2019 \nexperience at historical sites, in terms of the consumption of the physical capacity (Misham, \n1969) and spiritual values (Ellis & Heath, 1983). The concept of crowding, which is \ndefined as a psychological stress that sometimes accompanies high population density \n(Stokols, 1972) and the notion of what Urry (1990) refers to as romantic gaze, in terms of \nwhich solitude, privacy and a personal, semi-spiritual relationship with the object is \nappreciated, also corroborate the negative effects of other people on visitors\u2019 evaluation.   \nBy way of contrast, others come to an opposite view suggesting that the need for \ncommercialisation can be based on visitors\u2019 wish for familiarity  (Cohen, 1972; \nKrippendorf, 1987) and contemporary facilities (Ashworth, 1988; Ashworth & Tunbridge, \n2000). The favourable effects of the presence of others are also implied by the concept of \nthe collective gaze, in terms of which the presence of other people is necessary to give \natmosphere to the experience of a place (Urry, 1990). Further, some authors suggest that \ncrowding in certain situations may be experienced as exhilarating or arousing (Argyle, \nFurnham & Graham, 1981; Hull, 1990) or may be perceived as contributory to social \naffiliation (Ditton, Fedler & Graefe, 1983 cited in Manning, 1985; Graham & Burge, \n1984). \n  6 \nThese arguments suggest that visitors\u2019 evaluations of historical districts as tourism \ndestinations could relate to several evaluative dimensions, such as the place\u2019s spiritual \nvalue, or the sense of stillness or stimulation, according to visitors\u2019 mental states.  \nThe Structure of Visitors\u2019 Evaluation of Tourism Destinations \nThe complex nature of evaluation of a historical district as a tourism destination can \nbe investigated with reference to relationships between several components. In previous \nstudies, two components, - cognitive and affective (Baloglu, 1999, 2000, 2001; Baloglu & \nMcCleary, 1999a, 1999b; Beerli & Martin, 2004; Gartner, 1993; Pike & Ryan, 2004) - have \nemerged as important in destination image. Cognitive components relate to the physical \nfeatures (Hanyu, 1993) and can be regarded as derived from fact (Boulding, 1956) whereas \naffective components are concerned with the emotional quality of the destination (Hanyu, \n1993). Many authors have claimed that affective components are derived from cognitive \ncomponents (Anand, Holbrook & Stephens, 1988; Baloglu, 1999, 2000; Baloglu & \nMcCleary, 1999a; Woodside & Lysonski, 1989).  \nA means-end chain model provides a basis to describe the attributes of an object as \nthe means to achieve certain objectives, which are then used as the measures to achieve \nmore ultimate objectives (Gutman, 1982).  In this way, the hierarchical relationships \nbetween cognitive and affective components and mental states can be indicated. Visitors\u2019 \n  7 \nmental states can further vary in their degree of concreteness. For instance, want is usually \nregarded as a manifestation of need while value is defined as \u201ca belief about a desirable \nend-state that transcends specific situations and guides selection of behaviour\u201d (Solomon, \nBamossy & Askegaard, 1999, p.104). These arguments suggest the existence of \nhierarchical relationships between mental states.  \nIMPLEMENTATION, ANALYSES AND RESULTS \nThis study employed personal interviews using Repertory Grid Analysis and \nLaddering Analysis with photographs as stimuli. Repertory Grid Analysis attempts to \nextract subjects\u2019 constructs, which are the actual discrimination that subjects make between \nphenomena, by providing them with several sets of elements to be compared. Laddering \nAnalysis is based on the previously argued means-end chain model (Gutman, 1982), and \nrepeatedly asks subjects why a certain thing is favourable\/unfavourable\/important \n(ladder-up) or how they think any objects should be in order to meet their objectives \n(ladder-down) (Sanui, 1995). The outlines of this set of interviews are described in Table 1. \nThe explanations about the implementation and analyses are largely simplified for reasons \nof space. For further details, refer to Naoi, Airey, Iijima and Niininen (2005). \nThe use of photographs as stimuli has advantages in eliciting subjects\u2019 responses to \nfeatures of a historical district in that they can show a diversity of visual features which \n  8 \notherwise are difficult to present. Twenty-three settings within and around Sanmachi, in the \nmiddle of Takayama-shi, Gifu-Prefecture, Japan, were photographed under conditions \nvarying mainly in the degree of conservation and the prominence of stores. These settings \nwere chosen because of their preserved historical environments, and their touristic and \ncommercial characteristics. For each setting, several photographs were taken that vary in \nterms of the way people (no people, a few people, many people and so on) and vehicles \nappeared. In total, 58 photographs were selected as the stimuli.  \nThe authors classified the extracted components into cognitive components, \naffective components, wants, and needs. More abstract components, values, such as those \nthat Gutman (1982) describes as \u201cdesirable end-states of existence, [that] play a dominant \nrole in guiding choice pattern\u201d (p.60) and \u201ca type of consequence for which a person has no \nfurther (higher) reason for preference\u201d (p.64) were not extracted here. The authors \ncategorised the extracted components at each level into groups that share similar meanings.  \nThereafter, a tree figure that shows hierarchical relationships between components \nwas created for the whole group of subjects through the calculation of the frequencies of \nthe relationships between components. As reported in the study by Klenosky (2002), \nKlenosky, Gengler and Mulvey (1993), Naoi, Airey, Iijima and Niininen (2006) and \nReynolds and Gutman (1988), both positive and negative relationships were counted. \n  9 \nIndirect relationships were not included given their large number and hence the very \ncomplicated tree figure for each subject. However, so as to ensure that significant \nrelationships were not missed, the tree figure that illustrated direct relationships between \ncomponents for the whole group was created through several steps. Firstly, fequencies of \nfive or more were categorised into components based on similarities in their meanings. \nThese components were then re-categorised into a smaller number of groups through the \nscrutiny of all the direct relationships between affective components and needs\/wants, and \nthen all the direct relationships between the cognitive components and the re-grouped \naffective components.  In this way significant relationships could be found by grouping any \ncomponents with similar meanings into one.  \nThese analyses generated Figure 1, which includes components shown in Table 2. \nThe direct relationships between a pair of components appear in the figure only when \nfrequencies are five or more. In Figure 1, in Horiuchi\u2019s (1998) terms, one context,  related \nto social environment (\u201cMy daily life is tiring\u201d) is observed in addition to cognitive \ncomponents, affective components and mental states.  \nDISCUSSION \nDue to limited space, only the findings related to crowding, commercialisation and \nmodernity are reported here. As far as the presence of people is concerned, this was \n  10 \nperceived to be touristic\/famous and active and contributed to mental states such as \n\u201cseeing\/visiting something famous\u201d, \u201cbeing convinced that the place is worth visiting\u201d and \n\u201cseeking something outside daily life\u201d, and to be negatively related to \u201cquietness and \noldness\u201d and obstruct the pursuit of those objectives and relaxation. While some findings \nsuggest the negative effects of other people as implied by some arguments about crowding \n(Schreyer & Roggenbuck, 1978; West, 1982; Womble & Studebaker, 1981) and romantic \ngaze (Urry, 1990), the effects could also be positive when regarded as relevant to \n\u201cactiveness\u201d as suggested by some theories of crowding (Argyle et al, 1981; Hull, 1990) \nand the concept of collective gaze (Urry, 1990). Some findings also show that shops are \ncontributory to traditional\/touristic\/unique and active atmospheres, which disagrees with \nsome of the negative views about the perception of commercialisation (Boorstin, 1964; \nHerbert, 1995; Mathieson & Wall, 1982). However, at the same time relationships between \nmodern signs and new atmosphere imply negative impacts of commercialisation. These \nresults suggest that whether the effects of shops are favourable or not can be determined by \nwhether they are old-looking or not. Relationships between vehicles and newness, an \nordinary atmosphere, danger and the perception that the district is minor as a tourism \ndestination, indicate the negative effects of modernisation. A relationship is also observed \nbetween vending machines and a new atmosphere. While these results indicate that the \n  11 \nopportunities for visitors to appreciate the past are the main attraction (Lynch, 1972; Millar, \n1989; Moscardo, 2000), vending machines also seem to relate to convenience.  \n \nCONCLUSIONS \nThe results of this study suggest the efficacy of the methods in investigating the \nmixed effects of some variables such as the presence of other people or commercialisation \non visitors\u2019 evaluation of a historical district as a tourism destination. Although limited in \nscope for generalisation due to the limited sample size, this study provides indicators to a \nmethod, to theories and to achieving management objectives.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  12 \nREFERENCES \nAnand, P., Holbrook, M.B., & Stephens, D.
