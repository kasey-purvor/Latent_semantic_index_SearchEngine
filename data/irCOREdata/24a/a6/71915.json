INTRODUCTION \n \nHigh quality data sets of trace-metal distributions exist for a range of seasonally (Balistrieri \net al. 1992; Hamilton-Taylor et al. 1996; Achterberg et al. 1997) and perennially (Balistrieri et al. \n1994; Viollier et al. 1995) anoxic lakes, as well as for various anoxic marine basins (Jacobs and \nEmerson 1982; Kremling 1983; Jacobs et al. 1985).  The overall picture of trace metal behavior in \nanoxic systems, however, can appear confused for a variety of reasons. The same metal can show \ndifferent characteristics between systems. For example recent studies of Pb have reported a variety \nof distinctive concentration profiles, involving increased dissolved concentrations in suboxic or \nanoxic waters as a result of either Fe or Mn redox cycling (Benoit and Hemond 1990; Balistrieri et \nal. 1994; Balistrieri et al. 1995; Canfield et al. 1995; Viollier et al. 1995; Taillefert et al. 2000).  In \nmany cases these differences are likely to be real, reflecting variations in factors such as the \navailability of competing scavenging phases (e.g. Fe and Mn oxides, sulfides and organic matter) \nand the chemical composition of basin waters.  With other metals the data appear contradictory.  In \nthe case of Cu an association with Fe and Mn oxides has been proposed on the basis of laboratory \nbinding experiments and particle flux measurements (Baccini and Joller 1981; Sigg et al. 1995; \nXue et al. 1997), whereas dissolved Cu profiles show few features other than lower concentrations \nbelow the oxic-anoxic boundary, due to sulfide precipitation, across the full range of anoxic-basin \ntypes (Baccini and Joller 1981; Jacobs and Emerson 1982; Kremling 1983; Jacobs et al. 1985; \nBalistrieri et al. 1992; Balistrieri et al. 1994; Xue et al. 1997).  Another issue is an inability to \nseparate the individual effects of redox cycling associated with Fe and Mn oxides, due to the \noverlapping nature of their distributions and the compressed depth scales of processes around the \nO2-H2S interface.  For example significant increases in dissolved Ni with depth were observed \naround the interface in two meromictic lakes, but the relative roles of Fe and Mn redox cycling \ncould not be distinguished (Balistrieri et al. 1994; Viollier et al. 1995).  While it is becoming \n  \n 4\nincreasingly clear that Co behavior is generally dominated by an association with Mn oxides \nacross the full range of anoxic-basin types (Kremling 1983; Jacobs et al. 1985; Balistrieri et al. \n1992; Balistrieri et al. 1994; Lienemann et al. 1997; Taillefert et al. 2002), previously in Esthwaite \nWater, the location of the present study, the effects of Fe and Mn redox cycling on Co could not be \ndistinguished on the basis of profile characteristics alone (Achterberg et al. 1997). \nThe biogeochemical cycling of Ba in the open oceans has generated a great deal of interest \nin recent years, linked particularly to elucidating the nature of the processes resulting in the \nprecipitation and dissolution of barite (Stroobants et al. 1991; Bertram and Cowen 1997).  High \nconcentrations of dissolved Ba in anoxic marine waters have been interpreted in terms of these \nsame open-ocean processes (Kenison Falkner et al. 1993).  The few existing freshwater studies \nindicate more complex Ba distributions that are poorly understood.  The distribution of Ba has \nbeen linked to the redox cycles of either Fe (Viollier et al. 1995; Viollier et al. 1997) or Mn \n(Sugiyama et al. 1992; Sugiyama and Hori 1994) in different lakes, while in Esthwaite Water the \nobserved Ba behavior during anoxia has been separately attributed to biogenic barite precipitation \n(Finlay et al. 1983) and the redox cycling of either Fe (Sholkovitz and Copland 1982) or Mn \n(Hamilton-Taylor et al. 1999). \nThe above examples demonstrate that the evidence linking trace-metal distributions to \nspecific processes, particularly those involving Fe and Mn oxides, is often equivocal and basin-\nspecific.  It is also apparent that concentration profiles alone are generally not adequate to \nelucidate fully the complex processes controlling the cycling of trace metals in anoxic basins.  The \ngeneral aim of the present study is to provide new detailed insights into the biogeochemical \ncycling of Ba, Ni, Cu, Pb, Co and Al in a seasonally anoxic lake, particularly in relation to Fe and \nMn redox cycling, through a unique multi-method approach.  Water-column profiles of dissolved \nand particulate metal concentrations are combined with direct in-situ measurements of water \ncolumn remobilization from settling particles, and the subsequent interpretation is supported by the \n  \n 5\nuse of an equilibrium speciation model that includes different binding phases.  The previously \npublished remobilization measurements (Hamilton-Taylor et al. 1999) were made with a novel \nDGT-sediment trap device, developed during the course of the present study.  The speciation \nmodel (WHAM6) (Lofts and Tipping 2001) combines an inorganic speciation code with a discrete-\nsite, electrostatic sub-model of metal-humic interactions and a surface complexation description of \nthe equilibrium adsorption of metals by various oxides.  The model was run using its default \ndatabase, calibrated on the basis of a large number of published binding experiments with isolated \nhumic substances and preformed synthetic oxides.  This approach therefore provides an effective \ntest of the hypothesis that an equilibrium model, based on laboratory experiments and simple \nadditive effects of the main binding phases, can provide an approximate description of in situ \nbehavior. \nEsthwaite Water (EW) is a biologically productive and seasonally anoxic UK lake that has \nbeen extensively studied in all aspects of limnology (Heaney et al. 1986).  Previous EW studies \ninclude work on Fe, Mn and trace metals (Davison et al. 1980; Davison et al. 1982; Sholkovitz and \nCopland 1982; Hamilton-Taylor and Morris 1985; Hamilton-Taylor et al. 1996; Achterberg et al. \n1997) that forms the basis of several reviews of redox cycling in lakes (Sholkovitz 1985; Davison \n1993; Hamilton-Taylor and Davison 1995).  The lake can therefore be regarded as a model system \nwith well-defined limnological characteristics. \n \n2. METHODS \n \n2.1   Study Area, Field Measurements and Sampling \nEW is situated in the English Lake District (54\u00b022\u2019N, 2\u00b059\u2019W).  The lake has a surface area \nof 1.0 km2, mean and maximum depths of 6.4 m and 15.5 m, a volume of 6.4 x 106 m3, and a \n  \n 6\ntypical hydraulic residence time of ~13 weeks.  The sampling program corresponded to a period \nwhen summer stratification and seasonal anoxia were at their maximum stage of development. \nThe water-column profiling was undertaken on August 14 and 22 1996 at the deepest point \nin EW.  Temperature and dissolved oxygen were measured in situ using a Clandon YSI Model 57 \noxygen meter.  For trace metals, 125-ml high density polyethylene (HDPE) sample bottles and all \nfiltration and analytical equipment were pre-washed for 48 h in 10% Aristar HNO3,\n \nrinsed in \nMilliQ (MQ) water, soaked for 24 hours in MQ water and rinsed for a second time in MQ water.  \nConcentrated Aristar HNO3 was added to each sample bottle in the laboratory, prior to sampling, \nsufficient to make the final sample pH ~ 2.  All sampling equipment was transported to and from \nthe field in polyethylene bags.  Water samples were collected one at a time using a peristaltic \npump and PVC tubing, and filtered on-line through 0.45 \u00b5m HAWP Millipore membrane filters \nheld in Nuclepore filtration units.  The complete sampling procedure took ~15 minutes per sample.  \nThe pump and tubing were flushed with 15 L of MQ water in the laboratory prior to fieldwork, and \nthe filtration units were preloaded. At the start of each sampling day, an on-board field blank for \ntrace metals was obtained by passing a 10 L MQ-water sample through the entire sampling \nprocedure. The filters were subsequently retained in the filtration units and returned to the \nlaboratory in polyethylene bags for particulate metal analysis. \nAdditional particulate-matter samples were collected and preserved under inert conditions \non August 22, 1996, for redox-sensitive analysis in the laboratory.  The sampling method involved \npre-flushing a Nuclepore filtration unit, fitted with a Millipore polypropylene filter (0.6-\u00b5m pore \nsize), with N2-gas immediately before use.  After filtration of ~200 ml of lake water, the \nconnecting tubes to the filtration unit were sealed and the whole assembly immersed in liquid N2.   \nDissolved sulfide samples were collected on August 28 1996 using the same sampling-\nfiltration methodology as for metals.  The filtered water was passed directly into a 60-ml glass \nbottle, sealed with a Teflon-coated silicone rubber septum and aluminum cap.  The dissolved \n  \n 7\nsulfide was fixed upon collection, as ZnS, by the addition of 4 ml of deoxygenated zinc acetate \nsolution to the sampling bottle immediately prior to sample collection.  Sulfide was determined \ncolorimetrically in the laboratory, using an ethylene blue method (Davison and Lishman 1983). \n \n2.2   Analytical Methods \nThe membranes used to filter the lake water samples on August 22 were digested in 0.002 \nM HNO3 for 24 hours in order to obtain a direct measurement of labile particulate metal \nconcentrations. The acid eluents were subsequently filtered through 0.45 \u00b5m HAWP Millipore \nmembrane filters held in Nuclepore filtration units to remove undigested particles.  The relative \nefficiencies of 0.002 M and concentrated HNO3 (24-h leaches) for extracting Fe and Mn were \nrecently compared in particulate samples from the oxic and anoxic zones of Priest Pot, a small, \nhighly eutrophic lake, adjacent to EW (K. Warnken, pers. comm.).  The comparison showed that \nthe 0.002 M acid extracted ~70-80% of the conc. acid-leachable Mn in both oxic and anoxic \nsamples.  In the case of Fe, the dilute acid extracted a smaller fraction (20-25%) but the amounts \nleached by the two acids were highly correlated. \nFollowing storage at 4\u00b0C for a maximum period of 5 weeks, the filtered acid eluents from \nthe membrane digests and the filtered water samples were analyzed for Fe and Mn by \nelectrothermal AAS (Perkin Elmer 4100ZL) and for Ba, Co, Al, Ni, Cu and Pb by ICP-MS (Varian \nUltramass).  Fifteen subsamples of MQ were analyzed to ascertain analytical detection limits of the \nmetals (Table 1).  All sample concentrations were above the detection limits and the field blanks. \nWithin 24-h of collection, the particulate samples that had been collected and stored under \ninert conditions for redox-sensitive analysis were transferred anoxically to the vacuum chamber of \nthe Oxford Proton Microprobe (Grime et al. 1991) for analysis by MeV proton x-ray emission \n(PIXE) spectroscopy and proton- induced Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS).  The 1-\n\u00b5m proton beam was rastered to obtain intensity maps, reflecting elemental masses per unit area \n  \n 8\n(i.e. mol cm-2), from which elemental ratios and Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated. \nOther samples were transferred to a sealed tube in an H2\/N2-filled glove box for analysis by \nelectron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy, using a Bruker EMX instrument. \n \n2.3 Chemical Speciation Modeling \nWHAM6 (Lofts and Tipping 2001) combines the most recent versions of a series of \npublished equilibrium speciation models written by Tipping and co-workers.  WHAM6 is based on \nthe earlier models, WHAM (Tipping 1994) and SCAMP (Lofts and Tipping 1998).  WHAM6 \nincludes an inorganic speciation code, a discrete-site electrostatic model of cation-humic \ninteractions (Humic Ion-Binding Model VI) (Tipping 1998), and a surface complexation model of \nthe equilibrium adsorption of cations by Mn, Fe(III), Si and Al oxides (Lofts and Tipping 1998).  \nThe model was used to predict the concentrations and hence fractions of each metal associated \nwith colloidal or \u201cdissolved\u201d humic substances, Fe and Mn oxides, and particulate humic \nsubstances aggregated with the oxides (see below). \nRepresentative conditions were used as input parameters rather than the detailed conditions \nat each depth and time.  This approach allowed us to examine the effect of varying certain key \nparameters one at a time.  The input parameters are given in Table 2.  The major ion composition \n(Na, K, Ca, Mg, Cl and SO4) was based on the long-term average concentrations in EW (Carrick \nand Sutcliffe 1982; Sutcliffe 1982) and the pH and alkalinity values on the detailed studies of \nHeaney et al. (1986) and Maberley (1996).  EW is a circum-neutral lake with a background \nalkalinity of ~300 \u00b5equiv L-1.  During the summer the epilimnetic pH typically fluctuates between \n8 and 9 due to a combination of high productivity, poor buffering, and the effects of weather \nconditions on mixing and stratification.  Inorganic C is input to WHAM6 in the form of the partial \npressure of CO2.  We therefore used partial pressures of CO2 that produced an appropriate \nalkalinity at each pH value.  The partial pressures (\n2COP ) are shown in Table 2, along with the \n  \n 9\nalkalinities subsequently computed.  The corresponding CO2  saturation values range from ~500% \nin winter to ~5% at pH 9 in summer and are similar to those reported by Maberly (1996). \nThe concentration of dissolved humic substances in EW is typically within the range 1-2 \nmg L-1 (Tipping and Woof 1983).   Dissolved humic substances in surface freshwaters are \npredominantly fulvic acid (Malcolm 1985), so the model simulations were run at 1 and 2 mg L-1 \nfulvic acid for each set of pH and alkalinity conditions.  Only the 2 mg L-1 results are reported in \ndetail because the computed differences were generally small. Two concentrations of Fe oxide, \nequivalent to 0.7 and 30 \u00b5M particulate Fe, were used for the model simulations under summer \nmetalimnetic conditions, based on our own observations and those of Sholkovitz and Copland \n(1982) and Davison et al. (1980) (see section 3.1).  A single representative concentration  \n(equivalent to 0.5 \u00b5M particulate Mn) was used for Mn oxide (see section 3.1).  Fe-oxide particles \nin EW contain ~100 mg g-1 of humic substances, having the same uv-visible absorption \ncharacteristics as the dissolved humics (Tipping et al. 1981).  The Mn oxide formed in EW, in \ncontrast, contains only ~10 mg g-1 humic substances (Tipping et al. 1984).  The WHAM6 \nsimulations assumed these humic contents, as fulvic acid, in the Fe and Mn oxides (Table 2). \nIt has recently been suggested that Al and Fe(III) can compete significantly with trace \nmetals for binding by humic substances over a wide range of pH (4-9) (Tipping et al. 2002).  \nDissolved Al was measured as part of the present study, while activities of Fe3+ ( +3Fea ) were \nestimated assuming equilibrium with Fe oxide, following the approach of Tipping et al. (2002).  \nTwo values of the solubility product (i.e. 3HFe3 ++ aa = 102.5 and 104.0) were used, corresponding to a \nrange of possible Fe oxides.  The choice of solubility product had a negligible effect on the \npredicted speciation, and therefore the reported data were based on the value (104.0) that is more \nappropriate to freshly precipitated Fe oxide (Tipping et al. 2002).  The resulting Fe3+ activities, \ncalculated for the various pH values, are shown in Table 2.  The total concentrations of Co, Ni, Ba, \nPb and Cu were each fixed at a single concentration, typical of the measured concentrations of \n  \n 10\ndissolved + labile particulate metal in the upper part of the water column, where the highest Fe and \nMn-oxide concentrations were found.  The concentration of Al was fixed at its typical dissolved \nconcentration in the upper-water column, as labile particulate Al was not measured.  The \nsimulations were run with all trace metals present together. \n \n3.  RESULTS \n \n3.1. General Water Column Conditions and Fe and Mn Distributions \nThe temperature and dissolved oxygen profiles (Fig. 1) show that summer stratification and \nseasonal hypolimnetic anoxia were well-established, although the detailed mixing conditions \nvaried significantly between the two sampling dates.  On August 14 some temperature \nstratification occurred throughout the upper part of the lake, whereas on August 22 there was a \ndistinct well-mixed layer through the upper 4 m of the water column.  These differences were also \nreflected in the dissolved oxygen profiles. \nThe observed vertical distributions of dissolved Fe and Mn (Fig. 2) were similar to those \nreported previously in EW (Davison et al. 1980; Davison et al. 1982; Hamilton-Taylor and Morris \n1985; Hamilton-Taylor et al. 1996; Achterberg et al. 1997).  The increase in dissolved Mn (i.e. \nMn(II)) concentration at a shallower depth than that of dissolved Fe (i.e. Fe(II)) is due to the higher \nstandard potential of the Mn redox reaction and the slower oxidation kinetics of Mn(II) (Davison \n1993).  The contrasting profile shapes for dissolved Fe (downward increasing) and Mn \n(approximately constant at depth) have been attributed to Mn being mainly supplied by reductive \ndissolution of its oxide within the water column, whereas dissolved Fe is mainly supplied from the \nsediments (Davison et al. 1980; Davison et al. 1982). \nLabile particulate Fe and Mn both showed two maxima within the water column (Fig. 2).  \nThe depths of the upper peaks indicate that these maxima comprise mainly oxides, with the \n  \n 11\nshallower position of the Mn peak (5 m, compared to 7 m for Fe) again being consistent with the \ndifferences in the standard potentials and oxidation kinetics of the two metals.  The ESR spectrum \nof the inertly preserved particulate sample from 7 m confirmed the dominance of Fe(III).  The \nmimimum in particulate Fe at 10 m indicates that remobilization of the oxide was probably \noccurring in the anoxic water column at the time of sampling, as with Mn oxide.  The magnitudes \nof the Fe- and Mn-oxide maxima of 0.7 \u00b5M Fe and 0.5 \u00b5M Mn (Fig. 2) can be compared with \npreviously measured values for EW.  Sholkovitz and Copland (1982) reported mid-water maxima \nof Fe and Mn oxides in August-early September of 5-20 \u00b5M Fe and 0.35-1.3 \u00b5M Mn.  Davison et \nal. (1980) reported a mid-water Fe oxide concentration of 36 \u00b5M Fe in August 1977.  These \ncomparisons indicate that our own concentrations, obtained by digestion in 0.002 M HNO3, provide \na representative measure of the total Mn oxide concentrations, but may underestimate the total Fe \noxide concentrations due to incomplete dissolution.  This conclusion is consistent with the \ncomparative study of leaching-agent effectiveness described in section 2.2. In the context of the \nWHAM6 simulations it should be noted that the peaks of both Fe and Mn oxides occurred within \nthe metalimnion (see Figs. 1 and 2), where the pH is ~7 (see Section 2.3). \nThe intensely black color of the material comprising the lower (13 m) particulate-Fe peak \n(Fig. 2) suggests that it was substantially due to Fe sulfide.  This interpretation is supported by the \nESR and PIXE-RBS data.  The ESR spectrum of the 13-m sample showed a much smaller intensity \nfor Fe(III) than the 7-m sample, although the particulate Fe concentration was substantially greater \nat 13 m.  The PIXE-RBS analysis of the 13-m particulate sample showed that Fe and S were the \nmost abundant of the measured elements, apart from O, and that Fe correlated more closely with S \nthan any other element.  The correlation coefficient (r) between Fe and S was 0.90, while that \nbetween Fe and O was 0.12.  The average molar ratio of Fe:S was 1:1.3, suggesting a stoichiometry \nclose to that of the monosulfide.  These characteristics contrasted with those of the 7-m sample, in \nwhich S was much less abundant and Fe and S showed no correlation (r = -0.03). \n  \n 12\nThe dissolved sulfide profile was typical of EW during late-summer anoxia in showing a \ncharacteristic maximum (Fig. 1) (Davison and Heaney 1978; Smith et al. 1996).  It has been \ndemonstrated previously that equilibrium with respect to FeS precipitation exists below the \ndissolved sulfide maximum, with the downward decreasing dissolved sulfide concentration being \nlinked directly to removal by FeS precipitation (Davison and Heaney 1978; Smith et al. 1996).  \nExamination of Figs. 1 and 2 shows that the magnitude of the peak of labile particulate Fe (~4.5 \n\u00b5M) at 13 m was similar to that of the decrease in dissolved sulfide below 10 m.  This \napproximately 1:1 inverse relationship is in line with the stoichiometry of FeS and suggests that the \ntrends in the two profiles below 10 m were affected by local mass balance between the dissolved \nand labile particulate phases.  A similar mass balance was not observed for dissolved Fe because of \nits excess concentration.  The maximum of particulate Mn at 13 m coincides with that of Fe (Fig. \n2), suggesting a direct link with FeS precipitation.  The nature of this relationship and similar \nrelationships for the trace metals are explored further in section 4.2. \n \n3.2. Trace Metal Distributions \nAs a basis for interpretation, Pearson correlation coefficients (r) and simple linear \nregressions were determined on various subsets of the data for the August-22 profiles.  The \ndissolved concentrations between depths of 6 and 10 m and the particulate concentrations between \n3 and 10 m were used to elucidate the roles of Fe and Mn oxide precipitation-dissolution (see r \nvalues in Table 3).  The direct in-situ measurements of water column remobilization were made at \nthe base of the suboxic zone (at 7 m) in the period between the two sampling days in 1996 (14-22 \nAugust) and under similar redox conditions (at 4 m) between 12-14 August 1997 (Hamilton-Taylor \net al. 1999).  The measured remobilization of trace metals was previously shown to be associated \nwith Mn oxide dissolution, and possibly release from unknown phases, but not to any significant \nextent with Fe oxide dissolution (Hamilton-Taylor et al. 1999).  The remobilization data are \n  \n 13\npresented in terms of metal:Mn ratios as a means of circumventing any problems associated with \nminor losses of dissolved metals from the DGT-trap devices by diffusion  (Hamilton-Taylor et al. \n1999).  Comparisons are then made in Table 4 between these ratios and the gradients (\u2206metal\/\u2206Mn) \nobtained from the regression analysis. \nThe concentrations of dissolved Co and Ni increased with depth through the upper part of \nthe anoxic zone, reaching distinct maxima at 10-12 m (Fig. 3).  Above the maxima, their dissolved \nconcentrations correlated well with both dissolved Mn and Fe (Table 3).  Highly consistent Co:Mn \nmolar ratios (0.26-0.29 x 10-3) were obtained from the remobilization data and the regression \nanalysis of the dissolved concentrations (Table 4), suggesting that Co behavior above 10 m was \ndominated by Mn cycling.  Regression analysis of the dissolved concentrations between depths of \n5.5 and 10 m in August 1991, taken from Achterberg et al. (1997), gives a similar Co:Mn ratio \n(0.32 x 10-3), indicating its consistency over a number of years.  Significant remobilization of Ni \nwas also observed but, in contrast to Co, the various measures of the Ni:Mn ratio were highly \nvariable (Table 4).  The labile particulate Ni profile (Fig. 3) differed from that of Co in showing a \ndistinct maximum in the oxic part of the water column at 4 m, 1 m above the Mn-oxide peak (Fig. \n2). \nThe profiles of dissolved Ba and Al in August 1996 showed similar characteristics to those \nof Co and Ni through the upper part of the water column, but at depth generally exhibited a \ncontinuing downward increase instead of a maximum (Fig. 4).  Between 6 and 10 m dissolved Ba \nand Al exhibited good correlations with both dissolved Fe and Mn (Table 3), but below 10 m \ncorrelated positively only with Fe (Table 5).  Comparable dissolved Ba profiles in EW have \npreviously been reported by Sholkovitz and Copland (1982) and McGrath et al. (1989).  Labile \nparticulate Ba exhibited a distinct maximum in the oxic part of the water column that coincided \nwith the Mn-oxide peak at 5 m (Fig. 4 and Table 3).  Substantial suboxic remobilization of Ba was \nmeasured by the trap device and the associated Ba:Mn ratio ~0.64 x 10-3 was similar in August \n  \n 14\n1996 and 1997 (Table 4).  On the basis of the trap data, Hamilton-Taylor et al. (1999) argued that \nMn oxide, but not Fe oxide, was an important and consistent source of the remobilized Ba.  This \nconclusion is supported by microanalysis of individual oxide particles from EW that showed \nmeasurable Ba in Mn oxide, but not in Fe oxide (Tipping et al. 1981; Tipping et al. 1984).  \nHowever, a comparison of the Ba:Mn ratios, derived from the DGT-trap measurements and from \nthe regression analysis, shows a clear sequence (Table 4): DGT-trap < dissolved metal regression \n< labile particulate metal regression.  This variability, combined with the lack of correlation \nbetween dissolved Mn and Ba below 10 m, indicates that processes additional to Mn redox cycling \nalso play an important role in the observed behavior of Ba. \nAs with Ba a substantial amount of suboxic remobilization of Al was measured by the trap \ndevice and the associated Al:Mn ratio was 3-times higher in 1997.  The trap-derived Al:Mn values \nencompass the value derived from regressing the dissolved concentrations between 6 and 10 m \n(Table 4), suggesting that Mn cycling was capable of accounting for much of the accumulated \ndissolved Al over this depth interval. However, because all of the Mn oxide is generally \nremobilized in the water column of EW during mid-summer, with no significant diffusive input \nfrom the sediments (see Fig. 2 and section 3.1), the Mn redox cycle cannot explain the steadily \nincreasing downward concentration of dissolved Al below 10 m (cf. Figs. 2 and 4).  The overall \nshape of the profile therefore suggests that the behavior of Al may also be linked to the Fe redox \ncycle. \nThe profiles of dissolved Pb and Cu were relatively featureless, except for a single high-Pb \nconcentration at mid-depth and a poorly-defined decrease in dissolved Cu from ~10 nM in surface \nwaters to <5 nM in deep waters (Fig. 5).  The lowest dissolved Cu concentrations occurred in the \nregion of the Fe-sulfide maximum between 11 and 14 m.  The dissolved Cu profiles were similar \nto those observed in August and September 1991 by Achterberg et al. (1997).  Labile particulate \nPb and Cu both showed small maxima at 4 m that coincided with that of Ni.  The maxima were \n  \n 15\npossibly linked to their position at the base of the well-mixed layer as a result of some sort of \nsedimentation control (Kleeberg and Schubert 2000).  No measurable Pb or Cu remobilization was \nobserved in the DGT-trap device in 1996 and they were not determined in 1997 (Smith 1998). \nThus there was no observational evidence that Pb and Cu were linked to the redox cycles of either \nFe or Mn above a depth of 10 m.   \nThe labile particulate concentrations of Mn, Co, Ni, Ba, Pb and Cu were all highly \ncorrelated with that of Fe between 10 and 15 m on August 22 (Table 5), indicating that the six \nmetals were also associated with sulfide precipitation. The dissolved-concentration profiles of \nsulfide, Co, Ni, Pb and Cu also covaried between 10 and 15 m on August 22 (Figs. 1, 3 and 5) and \nshowed inverse relationships with their corresponding particulate concentrations. The inverse \nrelationship was best developed for Co and Ni.  The gradients of their dissolved-versus-particulate \nregression lines between 11 and 15 m were \u20130.8 and \u20131.1, respectively, suggesting good mass \n(strictly concentration) balances between the measured particulate and dissolved fractions. There \nwas a similar mass balance between dissolved sulfide and particulate Fe (see section 4.2), and \napproximate mass balances for Cu and Pb.  These mass balances could only be observed because \nthe dissolved and particulate concentrations were similar. In the case of Fe, Mn and Ba, such \neffects were either absent or not apparent because of the predominance of the dissolved \nconcentrations. \n \n4.  DISCUSSION \n \n4.1  Model Predictions \nIn general agreement with observations, WHAM6 predicts that dissolved trace-metal \nconcentrations predominate over those associated with Fe and Mn oxides for all metals except Pb \n(Table 6).  The dissolved fraction in the context of the modeling results refers to the sum of the \n  \n 16\ntrue solution and colloidal fulvic acid fractions, where the amount in true solution comprises the \nfree metal ion plus inorganic complexes.  Most of the Co is predicted to be in true solution with \nMn oxide accounting for 5-19% of the total Co.  The predicted values of the Co:Mn ratio (0.2-0.7 \nx 10-3 ), resulting from Co adsorption to Mn oxide, encompass the observed range of values (0.26-\n0.32 x 10-3).  WHAM6 predicts that Fe oxide-bound Co increases to 3% of the total at the higher \nFe oxide concentration (30 \u00b5M Fe), but it remains subordinate to the Mn-oxide fraction.  The \npredicted Co:Fe ratio (2 x 10-6) of the Fe oxide in this scenario is two orders of magnitude less than \nthe corresponding Co:Mn ratio, highlighting the relatively low affinity of Co for Fe oxide.  The \ngood agreement between the model predictions and field observations, obtained over several years, \nprovides strong evidence in support of Mn oxide dissolution being the predominant source of \ndissolved Co in EW under reducing conditions. \nMost of the Ni is predicted to be in true solution, although as much as 10% of the total Ni is \ncomplexed by colloidal fulvic acid (Table 6).  At the measured concentration of Fe oxide (0.7 \u00b5M \nFe), Ni adsorbed to Fe and Mn oxides is predicted to be present at low levels (\u22641% of the total Ni) \n(Table 6).  A trend is apparent in the predicted oxide fractions of Ni at 0.7 \u00b5M Fe in that at pH 7, \ntypical of waters in the vicinity of the oxide maxima, Mn oxide is more important than Fe oxide, \nwhereas at pH 9, typical of the well-mixed surface waters in summer, Fe oxide is more important.  \nSince the zero point of charge of amorphous Fe oxide and goethite is around pH 8 (Stumm and \nMorgan 1996), the effect of electrostatics on binding is probably the main cause of this predicted \npH trend.  At the upper limit of possible Fe oxide concentrations (30 \u00b5M Fe), the Fe oxide fraction \nmay become more important than Mn oxide even at pH 7 (Table 6).  The predicted Ni:Mn ratio, \nresulting from adsorption to Mn oxide, is 0.1 x 10-3 at the likely pH (7) at the Mn oxide peak, but \ndecreases to 0.02 x 10-3 at pH 9.  Therefore, despite the low absolute level of predicted Ni binding \nto Mn oxide, it is enough to account for the remobilization of Ni, measured by the DGT-trap \ndevice in 1996, and is close to the Ni:Mn ratio derived from regressing the dissolved concentration \n  \n 17\ndata (Table 4).  On the other hand, the predicted Ni:Mn values fall well below the values derived \nfrom regressing the labile particulate data and from the observed trap remobilization in 1997 \n(Table 4).  The corresponding predicted Ni:Fe values, resulting from Ni adsorption to Fe oxide, \nvary between 1 x 10-5 at pH 7 and 7 x 10-5 at pH 9.  These values are too small for the measured \nparticulate Fe-oxide concentrations (max. 0.7 \u00b5M Fe) to make a significant contribution to the 1-\nnM particulate Ni peak at 4 m or to the measured DGT-trap remobilization.  The combined field \nand modeling results thus indicate that the redox cycling of Mn, but not Fe, has an observable \neffect on the vertical concentration profile of dissolved Ni and its remobilization in the vicinity of \nthe oxic-anoxic boundary.  At the same time, the varying Ni:Mn values indicate that its behavior is \nmore complex than that of Co and is probably affected by additional processes. The EW \nobservations provide some of the clearest evidence of a link between Mn redox cycling and Ni in \nanoxic basins, although a Ni-Mn link was also suggested by the dissolved-concentration profiles in \nanother seasonally anoxic lake (Balistrieri et al. 1992). \nMore than 99% of the dissolved Ba is predicted to be in true solution in all simulations \n(Table 6).  Adsorption of Ba to Mn oxide is predicted to be more important than to Fe oxide, \nalthough particulate fulvic acid, associated mainly with the Fe oxide, becomes the main particulate \nfraction of Ba at the upper limit of possible Fe oxide concentrations (30 \u00b5M Fe) (Table 6).  The \npredicted Ba:Mn ratio, due to Ba adsorption to Mn oxide, is more or less constant in all model \nsimulations  at ~0.02 x 10-3.  This value is more than 30-times less than the lowest of the values \nobtained from the field data (Table 4).  Tipping et al. (1984) also reported that the levels of Ba in \nMn oxide particles in EW were high relative to those expected from adsorption to a pre-formed \nphase.  They interpreted this as indicating incorporation into the oxide during formation.  Another \npossible explanation is an inappropriate binding constant in WHAM6 for Ba uptake by Mn oxide.  \nThe default constant was derived from a linear-free energy relationship, due to the lack of \npublished experimental data for Ba binding to Mn oxide (Lofts and Tipping 1998).  Sugiyama et \n  \n 18\nal. (1992) also noted exceptionally strong binding of Ba to Mn oxides in Lake Biwa, and \nassociated binding experiments yielded a distribution coefficient for Ba that was an order of \nmagnitude or more greater than that of other alkaline earth elements.  The corresponding Ba:Fe \nvalues, predicted by WHAM6 as a result of Ba adsorption to Fe oxide, vary between 3 x 10-6 at pH \n7 and 6 x 10-6 at pH 9.  These low values suggest that Fe redox cycling makes no significant \ncontribution to the observed water-column behavior of Ba. \nWHAM6 predicts that the distribution of Al between true solution and colloidal fulvic acid \nis very sensitive to pH in EW (Table 6).  At pH 7 Al is associated mainly with fulvic acid, whereas \nat pH 8-9 it is predominantly in true solution due to the increasing importance of Al(OH)4-.  The \nmodel also predicts that the fractions of Al adsorbed by Mn and Fe oxides decrease sharply with \nincreasing pH, again due to Al(OH)4-, while the relative importance of Fe rather than Mn oxides \nincreases (Table 6).  Generally, the particulate fulvic-acid fraction associated with each oxide is \npredicted to contain more than the oxides themselves.  The exception to this generalization is that \nat the pH (7) of the oxide maxima in the metalimnion, more than 80% of the Al bound by Mn \noxide is predicted to be associated with the pure oxide.  The predicted overall Al:Mn ratio of this \noxide at pH 7 is 2 x 10-3 and 0.5 x 10-3 at 1 and 2 mg L-1 colloidal fulvic acid, respectively.  These \nvalues are of a similar magnitude to the values derived from the DGT-trap data and from \nregression analysis of the dissolved Al and Mn concentrations between 6 and 10 m (Table 4).  In \ncontrast, the predicted Al:Mn values at higher pH (e.g. 5 x 10-7 at pH 9, 2 mg L-1 colloidal fulvic \nacid) are orders of magnitude lower than the values shown in Table 4.  It follows that adsorption of \nAl to Mn oxides is sufficient to account for the levels of Al remobilization observed around the \noxic-anoxic interface as a result of Mn redox cycling.  The highly pH-dependent nature of Al \nadsorption to Mn oxide probably contributes to the variable Al:Mn ratio obtained from the field \nmeasurements (Table 4), especially given the extent of pH variation with time and depth during the \nsummer period.  The reverse argument may explain why the measured Co:Mn ratios were so \n  \n 19\nconstant (Table 4).  The  predicted Co:Mn ratio due to adsorption by Mn oxide varies by a factor \nof only ~3 between pH 7 and 9, so is much less sensitive to the known pH variations.  As the \ndegree of pH dependency of Ni binding to Mn oxide is predicted to be intermediate between that \nof Co and Al, it may contribute to the observed Ni:Mn variability (Table 4). \nThe predicted Al:Fe values at the pH (7) of the Fe oxide peak, associated with adsorption, \nare 2 x 10-3 and 1 x 10-3  at 1 and 2 mg L-1 fulvic acid, respectively.  These values agree with the \nAl:Fe ratio (2.1 x 10-3), derived from regressing the dissolved Al and Fe data below 10 m on \nAugust 22.  At higher pH the predicted Al:Fe values are much lower (e.g. ~10-4 at pH 8 and 10-6 at \npH 9).  The model predictions therefore support the field data in indicating that the observed \nbehavior of Al in EW is linked to the redox cycling of both Mn and Fe, although in the case of Fe \nit probably occurs mainly through an association with the organic fraction of the oxide.  An \nassociation between Fe oxide and Al in lake sediments was previously reported by Fortin et al. \n(1993). \nWHAM6 predicts that the dissolved-Pb fraction increases between pH 7 and 9 from 16% to \n79% of total Pb at the measured Fe-oxide concentration and 2 mg L-1 fulvic acid (Table 6).  These \npredictions are reasonably consistent with the observations in that a substantial proportion of Pb \n(~25%) was in the labile particulate fraction.  The dissolved Pb is predicted to be dominantly \ncomplexed by colloidal humic substances with <1 % in true solution.  The simulations also \nindicate that both oxides are likely to contain substantial amounts of Pb, with Mn oxide being \nrelatively more important at pH 7 and Fe oxide at higher pH. At the upper limit of possible Fe \noxide concentrations (30 \u00b5M Fe), the Fe oxide fraction is predicted to dominate even at pH 7 \n(Table 6).  The particulate fulvic fractions of the oxides are relatively unimportant in all cases.  \nThe model simulations highlight a feature that differentiates Pb from the other trace metals.  In the \nlatter case, the metal:Mn and metal:Fe ratios of the respective oxides are largely independent of the \noxide concentrations, e.g. the change from low (0.7 \u00b5M Fe) to high (30 \u00b5M Fe) Fe-oxide \n  \n 20\nconcentration has a negligible effect on the ratios.  This is because the trace metals are \npredominantly in solution, so that changes in the particulate metal fractions at varying oxide \nconcentrations have a negligible effect on the dissolved concentrations.  In the case of Pb, \nsignificant competition effects are predicted because of the high affinity of both oxides for the \nmetal.  Other natural solids are likely to have similar competition effects due to the high particle \naffinity of Pb generally.  This affinity probably accounts for the absence of any measurable Pb \nremobilization in the DGT-trap device and the limited increase in dissolved Pb below the oxic-\nanoxic boundary.  Thus when Mn oxide and its associated Pb were remobilized in the traps, Pb \nwas probably re-adsorbed by the Fe oxide and other natural particles, rather than being taken up by \nthe DGT device to any measurable extent. A similar Pb re-adsorption effect was observed \nfollowing the selective removal of Mn oxide in a sequential chemical extraction of a natural \nmixture of Fe and Mn oxides (Tipping et al. 1985). \nThe model predicts that Cu is mainly in solution as the fulvic complex, irrespective of pH \nand fulvic concentration (Table 6).  Most of the remaining Cu is associated with the particulate \nfulvic material, more than 90% of which is associated with the Fe oxide.  In terms of the pure \noxides, more Cu is bound by Fe rather than Mn oxide.  At the likely pH (7) of the Mn oxide peak, \nthe predicted Cu:Mn ratio due to adsorption by Mn oxide and its associated particulate fulvic acid \nis ~1 x 10-5.  This ratio is equivalent to 0.005 nM particulate Cu being associated with the Mn \noxide peak at 5 m and to 0.5 nM dissolved Cu being associated with the increase in dissolved Mn \nbetween 6 and 10 m.  These concentrations are negligible compared with the observed \nconcentrations of particulate and dissolved Cu (Fig. 5).  Furthermore the predicted ratio is about an \norder of magnitude less than could be detected by the DGT-trap device (Hamilton-Taylor et al. \n1999).  A similar situation exists with respect to the Fe profiles, although the increased dissolved \nFe below 10 m would be associated with an increase in dissolved Cu of ~5 nM, based on a \npredicted Cu:Fe ratio of ~5 x 10-5.  Such an increase was probably masked by the effects of sulfide \n  \n 21\nprecipitation. The model predictions are therefore consistent with the field observations in \nsuggesting that Mn redox cycling is unimportant for Cu in EW, while Fe redox cycling has no \nobservable effects on Cu profiles other than those due to sulfide precipitation. The absence of any \nobservable Cu cycling in the sub-oxic region of EW, and probably other anoxic basins, is due in \nlarge part to the overriding effect of complexation by humic substances. \n \n4.2  Sulfide Precipitation \nFormation of the solid phase(s) responsible for the maxima of particulate metals at 13 m could be \ncontrolled by the solubility of individual metal sulfides or an association with the major FeS phase.  \nWHAM was modified to include the metal-sulfide stability constants quoted in Huerta-Diaz et al \n(1998) and used to calculate the saturation index with respect to each metal sulfide. The results \nwere similar to those reported for other anoxic basins in showing a high degree of variation in the \ncalculated saturation indices (Jacobs et al. 1985; Balistrieri et al. 1992; Balistrieri et al. 1992; \nBalistrieri et al. 1994),  ranging from undersaturation with respect to Mn sulfide and \u03b1 NiS to a \nlarge degree of oversaturation for Cu and Pb sulfides.  This variability in the extent of saturation \nweakens the argument for the coincident peaks in particulate concentrations being due to formation \nof individual sulfides and favors instead an association between the trace metals and FeS.  Davison \net al. (1992) reported 4000 ppm Cu in FeS-rich particles in EW, which is equivalent to an atomic \nCu:Fe ratio of 5 x 10-3.  The Cu:Fe ratio obtained from the particulate maxima at 13 m was also 5 x \n10-3.  Coprecipitation and adsorption of Co, Ni and Mn by FeS has previously been demonstrated \nin the laboratory under conditions typical of anoxic waters (Arakaki and Morse 1993; Morse and \nArakaki 1993), while Mn scavenging by FeS in Esthwaite Water was previously suggested on the \nbasis of laboratory experiments (Hamilton-Taylor et al. 1996). \nDespite the evidence presented above it is not easy to explain the well-defined solid-\nsolution partitioning of the metals observed between 10 and 15 m, in particular the apparent mass-\n  \n 22\nbalance effects, in terms of control by sulfide precipitation, coprecipitation or adsorption by FeS.  \nThe observed similarity in behavior of such a chemically diverse range of metals suggests that \nthere is a single controlling mechanism.  We hypothesize that Mn, Ba, Co, Ni, Cu and Pb were \nassociated with FeS particles in the sub-micron to micron size range. Accordingly the nonfilterable \nfraction would contain colloidal as well as truly dissolved metal.  Aggregation or particle growth, \nwith resulting conversion of some fraction of the particles from a nonfilterable to a filterable size \n(0.45-\u00b5m pore size), could then account for the particulate maxima at around 13-m depth.  The \nmass balance effect between \u201cdissolved\u201d and \u201cparticulate\u201d phases for Co, Ni, Cu, Pb and sulfide \nsimply reflects this transfer.  The profiles of nonfilterable Mn and Ba were, in contrast, unaffected \nbecause of the high concentrations in true solution.   \nThe apparent mass balances suggest that vertical transport of Co, Ni, Cu and Pb was \nrelatively unimportant compared to transfer between colloidal and particulate phases.  The low, \nimplied settling rate for FeS particles is consistent with independent observations of their size.  \nPrevious PIXE-RBS analysis has shown that FeS particles in EW are not resolvable with a 1-\u00b5m \nproton beam (Davison et al. 1992).  Mackinawite particles formed in laboratory experiments were \nfound to be greater or less than 0.1 \u00b5m, depending on solution conditions and the associated degree \nof supersaturation (Arakaki and Morse 1993; Morse and Arakaki 1993).   Mackinawite is a \nmetastable Fe sulfide that readily forms from amorphous FeS (Rickard 1989; Morse and Arakaki \n1993).  In anoxic waters in Framvaren Fjord, twice the mass of FeS particles was collected by \nfiltration through 0.2-\u00b5m filters, compared with that obtained using 0.4-\u00b5m filters (Jacobs et al. \n1985).  Clearly the commonly used pore sizes of membrane filters (0.2 to 0.45 \u00b5m) lie within the \ntypical size range of FeS particles, so that the conversion of nonfilterable to filterable FeS \nobserved in EW was quite probably associated with a relatively small increase in particle size.  \nEstimation of the settling rates of the particles, using Stokes Law and assuming a density of 3 g \ncm-3, gives values in the order of 10-3 and 10-1 m day-1 for particles of 0.1 and 1-\u00b5m diameter, \n  \n 23\nrespectively.  These rates are consistent with approximate elemental mass balances being \nmaintained for periods of days given the 1-m sampling intervals. \nIf the FeS particles and their associated trace-metal contents are distributed between \ncolloidal and filterable fractions, there will be an effect on the distribution coefficient (Kd in L kg-1) \nof each metal.  Kd values were calculated for depths between 11 and 15 m, using Equation 1, where \nMp is the particulate (filterable) metal concentration (mol L-1), [FeS] is the \u201cparticulate FeS\u201d \nconcentration (kg L-1) based on the measured particulate Fe, and Md is the dissolved (nonfilterable) \nmetal concentration (mol L-1). \n    M    \nFeS][\nM\nd\np\nd =K      Equation 1 \n  The calculated Kd values for Co, Ni and Cu decrease with increasing Md, while the values for Mn \nand Ba remain relatively constant (Fig. 6a).  The Kd values for Pb were relatively noisy and are \nomitted.  The observed Kd trend for Co, Ni and Cu reflects the mass balance effect, i.e. Mp \nincreased as Md decreased.  The numerator in Equation 1 (Mp\/[FeS]) remained relatively constant, \nreflecting the good correlations of particulate trace metal concentrations with that of Fe.   \nValues of Kd were simulated while varying the proportion of metal in colloidal and \nparticulate forms. Simplifying assumptions were that throughout the 10-15 metre zone: (1) there is \na constant background concentration of truly dissolved trace metal (Mb); and (2) the total \nconcentration of trace metal associated with particulate and colloidal FeS (MFeS) is constant.  It \nfollows from these assumptions that the total trace metal concentration (Mb + MFeS) is also \nconstant throughout the 10-15 metre zone and this was approximately the case. The simulated \nconcentration of particulate (filterable) metal, sim-Mp, simply reflects the fraction of Fe present in \nthe particulate form (Equation 2). \np\np\nFeSp Femax\nFe\n MMsim\n-\n- =      Equation 2 \n  \n 24\n where max-Fep is the maximum Fe concentration (4.5 \u00b5M) associated with particulate (filterable) \nFeS. Four typical values of particulate (filterable) Fe concentrations in the anoxic zone (Fep = 1, \n1.5, 3, 4.5 \u00b5M) were chosen to provide a range of  colloid to particulate ratios. The simulated \nconcentration of dissolved (filterable) metal, sim-Md, is the sum of the truly dissolved metal and \nthe metal present associated with colloidal FeS (Equation 3). \n pFeSbd Msim MMMsim -- \u2212+=     Equation 3 \nThe MFeS and Mb values used in the calculations (Table 7) were based on the observed \nconcentrations.  The terms sim-Mp and sim-Md were then combined with [FeS], derived from the \nfour Fep values, to calculate Kd using Equation 1 (Fig. 6b).  Comparability with the observed Kd \nvalues is good, demonstrating that the assumption of metals associated with FeS particles being \npresent in colloidal and particulate form is consistent with the data.  The observed log Kd values \nare plotted against log [FeS] in Fig. 6c.  Although the trends are not so clear as those against Md, \nthere is a tendency for Kd to increase with [FeS] for most metals.  This trend is the opposite of the \n\u201cparticle concentration effect\u201d normally observed in aquatic systems in which colloids have an \nimportant role (Honeyman and Santschi 1988; Honeyman and Santschi 1989). \nOther than the Framvaren Fjord study, cited above, field evidence for the existence of \ncolloidal FeS is scarce.  Colloidal sulfides were considered as possible explanations of some \nobserved trace metal behavior (Benoit and Hemond 1990; Taillefert et al. 2000) but, apart from \nelectrochemical evidence for a dissolved multi-nuclear FeS species (Davison et al. 1998), we \nfound only one study with direct evidence of colloidal sulfides in lakes (Viollier et al. 1997).  \nBalistrieri et al. (1994) observed maxima of particulate (>0.4 \u00b5m) Cu, Pb, Zn and Ni below the \ndissolved sulfide maximum in a meromictic lake that coincided with dissolved minima of the same \nmetals, approximately on a 1:1 basis for each metal.  The relationships are similar to those \nobserved in EW that we have interpreted in terms of mass balances between colloidal and \nparticulate sulfides.\n  \n 25\n4.3 Biogeochemical Cycling of Ba and Al \nStudies of Ba and Al in anoxic basins are scarce in comparison with those of Co, Ni, Pb \nand Cu.  The combined observational and modeling results indicated that the behavior of Ba in EW \nwas associated with the redox cycle of Mn, but not Fe, plus at least one additional process.  Finlay \net al. (1983) previously showed that the distribution of Ba in EW is affected by the use of barite as \nan intracellular gravity sensing mechanism by the ciliated protozoan, Loxodes.  We suggest that \nthe behavior of Ba in the present study, including the observed sequence of Ba:Mn values (DGT-\ntrap < dissolved metal regression < labile particulate metal regression), can be explained by a \ncombination of the Mn redox cycle and barite precipitation-dissolution associated with Loxodes.  \nThe relationship between the Ba:Mn ratio calculated from the DGT-trap measurements (0.64 x 10-\n3) and the particle-derived ratio (13.7 x 10-3) indicates that Mn oxide accounts for only a small \nfraction (5%) of the observed particulate-Ba maximum at 5 m.   Finlay et al. (1983) showed that \nthe abundance of Loxodes peaked immediately above the oxic-anoxic boundary in EW and also \ncorrelated with a 7-nM peak of particulate Ba.  They independently estimated that 5.5 nM of this \nwas due to Loxodes.  This estimate can be compared with the 6.4-nM peak of labile particulate Ba \nseen at 5 m in Fig. 4.  Given the difference in the Ba:Mn ratios derived from the DGT-trap \nmeasurements and the particle-based regression analysis, it follows that the particulate-Ba \nmaximum at 5 m was also due mainly to the presence of Loxodes.  Whether its coincidence with \nthe Mn oxide peak is fortuitous or whether there is a tighter coupling of the two processes (e.g. Mn \noxidizing bacteria acting as a food source for Loxodes) is unknown.  The continuing small increase \nin dissolved Ba concentrations below 10 m (Fig. 4) is probably linked to the further dissolution of \nthe microbial barite in bottom sediments.  The accumulated evidence gives no support for an \nassociation of Ba with Fe cycling in EW, as originally suggested by Sholkovitz and Copland \n(1982) on the basis of correlations between the seasonal and depth distributions of the two metals. \n  \n 26\nIn relation to the observed binding of Ba to FeS, database searching has failed to find any \nprevious report of a Ba-sulfide association in either lake or marine anoxic basins. The association \nprobably arises through adsorption, as with Mn (Arakaki and Morse 1993).  Other group 2 metals \n(Ca and Mg) adsorb to mackinawite to a similar extent to Mn (Morse and Arakaki 1993), and Fig. \n6 shows that the observed Kd values of Ba and Mn were similar.  \nThe profiles of dissolved Ba concentrations in EW are most like those in the Cariaco \nTrench and Framvaren Fjord (Kenison Falkner et al. 1993) in showing downward increasing \nconcentrations, commencing slightly above the O2-H2S interface.  In Pavin Lake, a meromictic \nwater body, the main increase in dissolved Ba occurred in the lower part of the anoxic zone in the \nregion of the water-sediment interface (Viollier et al. 1995).  The particulate Ba profile showed a \nmaximum immediately above the O2-H2S interface, that correlated better with the Fe-oxide peak \nthan that of Mn oxide, and a bottom maximum.  These maxima were interpreted as being due to \nscavenging by Fe(III) oxide and ferrous phosphate, respectively (Viollier et al. 1997).  We suggest \nthat biogenic barite cannot be discounted as a possible source of the mid-depth maximum, the \nmagnitude of which (~5 nM) was the same as that at 5 m in EW. \nThe distribution of Al in EW is similar to that observed in Pavin Lake (Michard et al. 1994; \nViollier et al. 1995) in that dissolved Al concentrations and pH are high in surface productive \nwaters and low in the underlying region of Mn and Fe-oxide formation.  The dissolved Al profile \nin Pavin Lake was attributed to the effects of pH on Al(OH)3 solubility (Viollier et al. 1995).  \nSaturation conditions with respect to Al(OH)3 in EW were determined by using WHAM6 to \ncalculate the ion activity product (IAP = 3\/3 ++ HAl aa ) over a range of typical conditions (Table 8).  \nThe pH values were taken from Heaney et al. (1986), fulvic acid concentrations from Tipping and \nWoof (1983), and the total dissolved Al concentrations from Fig. 4.  The solubility product of \nAl(OH)3 is reported to be in the range 108-109 (LaZerte 1989).  The waters are therefore \nundersaturated throughout the epilimnion and metalimnion and approach saturation only in anoxic \n  \n 27\nhypolimnetic waters.  Most significantly the metalimnetic waters in the region of the Mn and Fe \noxide maxima on August 22 are around an order-of-magnitude undersaturated with respect to the \nleast soluble form of Al(OH)3, so that Al(OH)3 precipitation cannot be the cause of the dissolved \nAl minimum at 6 m (see Figs. 1, 2 and 4).  The calculation of Al(OH)3 saturation in the \nhypolimnion excluded Al-sulfide species, since no stability constants were found in either the \nSmith and Martell (1976) or NIST (1997) databases.  Overall the data are inconsistent with control \nby Al(OH)3 solubility and further support the role played by Fe and Mn redox cycling.  Because \nthe dissolved Al concentrations are around 5-times lower in Pavin Lake than in EW, while the pH \nvalues and DOC concentrations are broadly similar, we speculate that Fe and Mn redox cycling \nmay also affect the behavior of Al in this meromictic lake. \n \n4.4  General Discussion \nThe results of the WHAM6 modeling are generally consistent with the field observations \nmade under oxic and suboxic conditions in EW.  In particular, the model provides a good \nprediction of the observed binding of Co and Ni to Mn oxide and of Al to both Mn and Fe oxides. \nThe excellent agreement between the observed and predicted Co:Mn ratios appears surprising \ngiven that Co binding to Mn oxide can involve substitution in structural sites and oxidation to \nCo(III) (Crowther et al. 1983).  However, while the experimental binding data are described by \nsurface complexation within WHAM6, the underlying binding mechanisms occurring in the \nexperiments may in reality be more complicated.  For example the data set used to calibrate Co \nbinding in WHAM6 involved a 48-h sorption period that resulted in structural substitution of Co \nfor Mn, in addition to surface exchange (Loganathan and Burau 1973).  More generally, however, \nthe degree to which trace metal binding to Fe and Mn oxides is predicted by an equilibrium model \nbased on adsorption to preformed synthetic phases was unexpected, given the complex, dynamic \nand often microbial nature of processes in lakes.  The model has proved a valuable tool in \n  \n 28\nevaluating this field data set.  Given the inherent simplifications of WHAM6 and the input data \nused in the modeling, including the omission of other adsorbents (e.g. clay minerals and silica) and \norganic ligands of microbial origin (Sigg et al. 1995; Ellwood et al. 2001), further testing of the \nmodel against other field-data sets is required before it can be used more generally for predictive \npurposes. \nThe geochemical modeling highlights the fact that trace metal speciation in general, and \nbinding to Mn and Fe oxides in particular, can be highly sensitive to the variations in solution \nconditions occurring through a depth-interval of just a few metres in a typical lake.  It follows that \nthe relative and absolute importance of Mn and Fe oxides as trace-metal carriers will vary greatly \nover the full range of freshwater conditions.  Conversely, we suggest that it is no coincidence that \nthe metal (Co) showing the most consistent behavior in both freshwaters and seawater is the metal \npredicted by WHAM6 to be the least sensitive to variations in solution conditions.   \n \n5.  CONCLUSIONS \n \nThe dissolved and particulate concentration profiles and the water-column remobilization \nof Co, Ni, Ba, Al, Cu and Pb in EW during midsummer anoxia showed distinctive patterns of \nbehavior for each metal that were related to the position of the O2-H2S interface and to Fe and Mn \nredox cycling.  In the region of the O2-H2S interface, the behavior of Co and to a lesser degree Ni \nwas dominated by Mn redox cycling.  Ba behavior was dominated by the biogenic precipitation of \nbarite, mediated by protozoa, and its subsequent dissolution, and to a lesser degree by Mn redox \ncycling.  The behavior of Al was linked to both Mn and Fe redox cycling, but the extent of binding \nto Mn and Fe oxides and to humic substances was poised with respect to pH.  The profiles of Pb \nand Cu showed comparatively little variation above the dissolved sulfide maximum, even though, \nin the case of Pb, the WHAM6 simulations indicated that binding to Mn and Fe oxides was \n  \n 29\nimportant.  The featureless nature of the Pb profiles in the upper part of the water column was \nlinked to its tendency to bind to all particle types and to dissolved humic substances, whereas that \nof Cu was linked to its overriding association with dissolved humic substances.  Below the \ndissolved sulfide maximum, Co, Ni, Ba, Cu, Pb and Mn were affected by sulfide precipitation, \nprobably through a common association with FeS.  In the case of Co, Ni, Cu and Pb, inverse \nrelationships between the measured \u201cdissolved\u201d and particulate concentrations were attributed to \nsize differences in the FeS particles, i.e. nonfilterable and filterable by 0.45-\u00b5m membrane filters. \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \nThis work was made possible by the award of a Studentship (GT4\/94\/169) and a Grant \n(GR9\/02213) from the Natural Environment Research Council.
