This paper reviews the integration of such computer technology into the new medical\ncurriculum at King's.\nIntroduction\nRecently, there have been major changes in the requirements of medical education which\nhave set the scene for the revision of medical curricula (Towle, 1991; GMC, 1993). As part\nof the new curriculum at King's, the opportunity has been taken to integrate computer\ntechnology into the course through Computer-Assisted Learning (CAL), and to train\ngraduates in core IT skills. Although the use of computers in the medical curriculum has\nup to now been limited, recent studies have shown encouraging steps forward (see Boelen,\n1995). One area where there has been particular interest is the use of notebook computers\nto allow students increased access to IT facilities (Maulitz et al, 1996).\nMedical education and computer technology\nStudies have shown that the level of computer skill in medical students is variable, with a\nminority feeling confident in the use of computers (Oliveira et al, 1994; Osman and Muir,\n1994), and the impact of computers on learning currently falls below the required critical\nmass to have a serious effect on learning in medicine (Harden and Smyth, 1994).\nNationally there is insufficient integration of computers into the learning environment,\nVickie Aitken et al Integration of computer technology into the medical curriculum: the King's experience\nand CAL is rarely used beyond its place of origin with few packages surviving in the long\nterm. In addition, information-dissemination on medical education and computer-\nsupported learning is still in its infancy, although sites such as ASME, the CTI at Bristol\nand MADEN are addressing this problem. A major impetus to integration will be the\nability to estimate costs, and thorough investigation of cost effectiveness is still awaited\n(CSUP, 1992). Moreover, technical issues are a major consideration. It is hard to judge\nwhether technology for which material now being developed will be out-moded when the\nmaterial appears, and it is as difficult to ensure the provision of an adequate hardware and\nsoftware base. Although medical students' experience with computers is closely related to\nattitude, all rate computer literacy as important (Fox, 1996). Access is also an important\nfactor, as medical students share the generic undergraduate circadian rhythms which\nrequire them to be up all night and to sleep most of the day.\nAs well as the specific issues surrounding medical education, higher education is ripe for\nnatural inertia (Boelen, 1995) as changes are forced by external sources under the banner\nof 'value for money'. Institutional changes have centred around strategies linking\ncomputing services, support systems and libraries to provide an integrated learning\nenvironment.\nThe advantages of using computers to aid learning in medicine has been documented\n(Koschmann, 1995), and include self-paced learning and immediate feedback. The\nlimitations include the possibility of passive interaction and lack of flexibility and control,\nalthough it can be argued that good interactive design and the use of modern authoring\ntools overcome many of these limitations. Recently, work looking at the efficacy of the\nsoftware in the transfer of content as well as problem-solving skills has been carried out\n(Khadra and Guinea, 1996). Other work investigating students' attitudes in a medical\nenvironment in the UK, in the USA and in the Netherlands has shown that the majority of\nmedical students find the use of computers not impersonal nor difficult, but challenging\nand motivating (see Plasschaert et al, 1995).\nThe effective integration of computer technology into the medical curriculum centres\naround a number of issues: the pedagogic gains which can be achieved need to be\nresearched, the cost-effectiveness of the option needs to be answered, the resistance to the\nintroduction of change needs to be understood, and the technical challenges posed have to\nbe mastered.\nConstraints within the medical curriculum\nIn the UK, medical education has traditionally comprised two parts: two years of basic\nmedical sciences followed by three years of clinical training. For many medical schools, the\nscience and clinical work are carried out on separate campuses. At King's, the two main\ncampuses are three miles apart, and this presents logistical problems as these two\ncomponents of the course are integrated into a single program.\nWithin clinical medicine there are further constraints. Students are expected to learn\nclinical skills from practising clinicians and through working with patients. This\nnecessitates high staff-student and patient-student ratios. With the high degree of\nspecialization seen in many teaching hospitals, together with the decrease in in-patient beds\nin favour of community and ambulatory care, there is an increasing need to find\n60\nALT-J Volume 5 Number 2\nplacements for students outside their home teaching hospital. Some of these placements\nwill necessarily be at a considerable distance from the main clinical site. Moreover, it is now\nrecognized that students need to see health care provision and meet patients in settings\nsuch as community clinics, general practices and district general hospitals as well as the\nspecialized environment of the teaching hospital. Thus contemporary medical students\nincreasingly spend their time away from their fellows and their medical school. Such\nchanges pose considerable challenges in establishing effective communications between\nstudents, tutors and the centre and in allowing students in distant locations access to the\nlearning resources available at the centre; such changes are affecting all medical schools.\nKing's believes that effectively implemented IT can substantially contribute to the solution\nof these problems\nThe King's new curriculum\nKing's new curriculum represents a radical change from traditional models of medical\neducation. The analysis of the problems have been well set out in Towle (1991), and\npotential solutions identified in GMC (1993). King's new curriculum follows these\nrecommendations closely, and pioneers new approaches in a number of areas. In designing\nthe new curriculum, King's initially created a consensus document setting out a\nspecification for the new doctor we wanted to 'create'. The statement The King's Doctor\n(Booton and Marshall, 1997) defines the attributes of a doctor in terms of the attitudes,\nskills and knowledge which the new graduate would require. This in itself is a major\nchange from traditional curricula which are almost solely defined in terms of knowledge.\nIn planning the curriculum, to deliver the desired objectives, a structure was designed to\nensure that science and clinical learning were addressed in an integrated fashion, and that\nskills-learning was carried out in a context appropriate to its eventual use. In particular, the\nskills programme addressed IT, recognizing the need for graduates to possess a series of\ncore IT skills, and at the same time requiring students to use these skills to enable them to\nprogress on the course. The programme was planned to be cumulative, building on the\nskills learned year by year in a logical manner and linking with the students' growing\nknowledge of other subjects, so allowing a proper context for their skills-learning.\nIntegration of computer technology into the King's programme\nStudents entering medical school have been found to lack basic IT skills, and the King's\ncurriculum assumes little or no knowledge. The first days of the new students' introductory\ncourse is spent on basic IT-skills training, especially how to use the tools which will be\nemployed to access and present coursework. There is a requirement to use IT and to be\nassessed on it. To enable deep learning, the student revisits the knowledge and skills\nlearned in the introductory course by the incorporation of IT into the course itself. This\napproach is obviously applied in the use of CAL where possible, and also in the\nrequirement to submit word-processed coursework, presenting peers and tutors with the\nuse of common computer-based office presentation software and data-analysis using\ncommon spreadsheet and statistics software. Electronic reference material is made widely\navailable and the students are required to use it to complete course modules. Students\ntherefore do not just learn about computers but through computers and with computers,\nthe objective being to create a constructive engagement with learning such that the\n61\nVickie Aitten et a\\ Integration of computer technology into the medical curriculum: the King's experience\nstudents actively find knowledge by the interpretation of results from hypotheses-testing\n(see Jacobs and Heath, 1995).\nA problem identified by Harden and Smyth (1994) was that few programs were available at\nany of the medical schools. Moreover, as mentioned earlier, CAL is rarely used beyond its\nplace of origin. It is for these reasons that King's has employed a full-time CAL co-\nordinator with a background in the TLTP projects. The approach taken is to use what CAL\nis available (an approach well recognized by Laurillard, 1993) both commercially and from\nother UK and US medical schools. Only when such material does not fulfil the need, or\nmatch the quality requirements, of the course, are further CAL packages authored in-\nhouse. Although not vast, King's does have a library of CAL packages which have been\ndeveloped in-house especially for the basic sciences content of the course. Part of the remit\nof the co-ordinator is to link with staff developing the new curriculum to ensure that the\nappropriate CAL materials are available.\nTo facilitate the integration of the IT approach to the new curriculum, all first-year\nmedical students have been offered their own notebook computer. This has been made\npossible by the involvement of a large international commercial partner in the initiative.\nEach notebook has a colour screen, a 100 MHz Pentium CPU, 8 Mb RAM and an 800 Mb\nhard disk. Facilities have been made available to allow students to extend most\ncomponents of the specification should they so wish. In conjunction with the commercial\npartner, it has been possible to ensure that the computers have standard application\nsoftware pre-loaded, and the inevitability of technology advancement is catered for, in that\nevery notebook will be upgraded to the most recent model after two years. Security has\nbeen a cause for concern: all students must ensure that the computers are insured, and\nthere is a provision for secure lockers at each campus for each student.\nTo support these newly available facilities, King's is currently at the stage of extensive\nrebuilding of the local and wide-area networks. Within and between the campuses, a new\nfibre-optic network is being installed; and to support the community learning centres,\nfacilities for dial-up network access are being made available, which will also allow remote\naccess from many other sites, including the student's home. Online support over the new\nnetwork is also being implemented: communication with tutors is made available via email,\nthere are multiple choice self-test questions, and course evaluation is made using the World\nWide Web at the King's College site.\nConclusions\nThe ultimate aim of the project is to embed the integration of technology into the medical\ncurriculum. With this aim in mind, King's has initiated an evaluation programme that will\nassess the effects that the use of IT tools can have on students' approaches to learning and\nprofessional development.\nFrom the King's experience so far, integration requires a comprehensive knowledge of the\ninstitution plus an infrastructure to support the change which has sufficient resources to\nallow a smooth transition. In addition, integration requires a multi-disciplinary team\nworking in close collaboration and using seed projects as a focus for development. Above\nall, to carry this through, enthusiasm will be essential.\n62\nALT-J Vo\/ume 5 Number 2\nReferences\nBoelen, C.
