Beginning in 1907 Gertrude\nVanderbilt Whitney had championed American art when it was overshadowed by\nEuropean art, but by the century\u2019s end and seventy years after the Whitney was\nfounded the United States had become the pre-eminent presence in visual culture.\nIt had begun to assume this position not too long after publishing magnate Henry\nLuce used the phrase \u2018\u2018 the American Century\u2019\u2019 in Life magazine in February\n1941, and, eight years later, it was Life magazine which picked up Clement\nGreenberg\u2019s championing of Jackson Pollock and headlined the question \u2018\u2018 Is he\nthe greatest living painter in the United States? \u2019\u2019 Henry Luce believed that a\nUnited States, speaking with one voice, must have a world-role, but, if he\ncorrectly anticipated a US-led process of cultural globalisation, he failed to\nrecognise the differences within the country and the buffeting which national\nidentity would endure once the unity brought about by World War Two and its\nimmediate aftermath had been dissipated. Luce\u2019s own media business augmented\nDouglas Tallack is Professor of American Studies at the University of Nottingham,\nNottingham NG7 2RD, and Director of the AHRB-funded \u0083 Cities research project at\nBirmingham and Nottingham.\nI wish to thank the AHRB and also the British Academy for supporting two research\nvisits to New York City during which I was able to see both parts of The American\nCentury at the Whitney Museum of American Art.\n128 Review Essay\nthe significance of the expression \u2018\u2018 the American century \u2019\u2019 and symbolised the\ncoming together of commerce and culture in an ambiguous logic of innovation\nand yet sameness which the word \u2018\u2018variety \u2019\u2019 so perfectly conjures up. Whatever\nelse it has been, then, America\u2019s century has been one of reproducible images and\npopulist sentiments, expressed through a battery of cultural forms from print,\npainting, and photography to radio, cinema, television, and digitised media.\nWithin this powerful set of political, social, economic, and technological\ncircumstances the visual arts have sought to identify what constitutes art and,\nconcomitantly, to formulate theorised or at least working relationships between\nart and life, beginning with what we still call realism and continuing through\nmodernism to post-modern pastiche and performance- and site-specific art. There\nhave been stout attempts to demarcate respective spheres within visual culture\nunder the impact of modernism \u2013 overall, the cultural movement of the American\ncentury \u2013 even as visual forms have migrated towards each other so that such\nnotions as a consumable work of art or a painted building have become quite\ncommonplace. Migrations brought about by the increasing interdependence of\nmodes of production and dissemination within the culture industry have, though,\nbeen a source of aesthetic innovation and strength: if Sol LeWitt\u2019s or Chris\nBurden\u2019s work is consumed, that is part of its resistance to consumption. The\nresults are very noticeable in The American Century which tends towards the\ninclusive notion of visual culture rather than art. To this end, both exhibition\ncatalogues include a large number of individually authored \u2018\u2018Sidebar Texts \u2019\u2019 ; for\ninstance, \u2018\u2018Vaudeville and the Follies \u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Bebop and Rhythm and Blues \u2019\u2019 from\nthe 1900\u20131950 volume, and \u2018\u2018Modern Dance : Chance and Improvisation\u2019\u2019 and\n\u2018\u2018Video Art, Film and Video Installation\u2019\u2019 from the 1950\u20132000 volume. These\n\u2018\u2018Sidebar Texts \u2019\u2019 complement the comprehensive narrative accounts provided by\nBarbara Haskell for the first half of the century and Lisa Phillips for the second\nhalf. Narrative accounts, sidebar texts and the excellent illustrations show how\ntwentieth-century American artists, with the indispensable help of Marcel\nDuchamp (who took US citizenship in 1954), have posed some of the most\nimportant, if discomforting, questions about the status and even the point of art\nprecisely by focussing upon intersections between art forms and, more and more,\nbetween art and consumer and industrial culture. By the 1950s and 1960s there\nis no easy way of distinguishing the cultural context from the artworks ; as is\napparent to visitors to Part Two of the Whitney show as they wander past Claes\nOldenburg\u2019s Bedroom Ensemble, Replica \u0081 (1969) and into a plastic\u2013fantastic living\nspace oriented towards a television screen.\nThe global reach to which Henry Luce and other forces within the culture\nindustry have aspired has, ironically, questioned not simply the supposed aura of\nthe artwork but, equally, the very idea that there can be a national art and a\nnational identity which can be read off from that art. This is a consistently\ntroublesome theme in The American Century, and it is now quite hard to imagine\nan exhibition in another hundred years which would possess a clear national\ntheme. Luce and the culture industry operated in a cosmopolitan world,\nunderpinned by technical and industrial developments, and it is therefore not\nsurprising that the base in nature, from which nineteenth-century American art\ndrew its identity and many of its strengths, has been eroded during the twentieth\nReview Essay 129\ncentury. Nature has its proponents, though, and these are well represented in the\ncatalogues : abstract artist, Arthur Dove; Ansel Adams, particularly his\nphotographs of Yosemite ; American Scene painters (Thomas Hart Benson, John\nSteuart Curry and Grant Wood) and, also from the 1930s but in an anguished vein,\nthe seascapes of Marsden Hartley ; and, in a comprehensive combination of\nsculpture and architecture, the earthworks of the 1960s and 1970s by Michael\nHeizer (Complex One in Nevada, 1972), James Turrell (notably, his excavation and\ntransformation of the Roden Crater in Arizona), and Robert Smithson. For all the\nemphasis upon the urban, industrial scene and the cosmopolitan modernism of\nmost twentieth-century American art, a photograph of Robert Smithson\u2019s Spiral\nJetty (1970) was chosen for the frontispiece to the 1950-Present catalogue. But it\nis at least a possibility that this is the last time in a major, all-encompassing\nexhibition that we will catch so consistently the echoes of the wilderness past.\nThere are two other conjunctions of the traditional and the modern (and post-\nmodern) in twentieth-century art which stand out in the Whitney\u2019s summative\nexhibition: the tension between representational and abstract impulses and the\nstruggle over the human figure. Unlike such mid-century American modernists\nas Pollock, de Kooning, and Rothko, the early American modernists Max Weber,\nJohn Marin, Georgia O\u2019Keeffe, and Joseph Stella maintained more contact with\ntheir subject-matter and particularly when they painted New York City. That is\nto say, they were modernists in the dual sense of seeking ways to convey the pace\nand dynamism of modernity (if not to represent it in the traditional sense) and,\non the other hand, the experience of being part of the revolution in perception\nwhich made the surface of the work of art the focus of attention. For all the\nformal experimentation by those painters for whom the Armory Show was such\nan event, it is perverse not to see the elevated trains and skyscrapers in Weber\u2019s\nNew York (1913) and Martin\u2019s Lower Manhattan (1920). Similarly, Brooklyn\nBridge is unmistakably the subject which Stella painted over and over again\nbetween 1917 and the 1940s, and we can recognize the Radiator Building in\nO\u2019Keeffe\u2019s The Radiator Buiding \u2013 Night, New York (1927). Yet we cannot easily\nlook through the overlapping shapes in Weber, the wash of water-colours in\nMarin or get away from the fact that O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s is indisputably a painted building,\npartially gridded, be-hatted by its crown, and centred by the searchlights which\narrow into it yet de-centred by the distracting red neon letters \u2018\u2018Stieglitz \u2019\u2019\n(O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s husband). Similarly, the painterly sheen which Stella imparts to his\ndepiction of the steel cables of the bridge arrests our efforts to attach signifier to\nsignified, and if we do persist then we \u2018\u2018 see \u2019\u2019 the electricity (rather than the\nBridge\u2019s steel cables) which fascinated Stella, the Italian immigrant, as it did the\nItalian futurists whose work he had seen at the Galerie Bernheim-Jeune in Paris\nin 1912.\nEdward Hopper \u2013 who else, given that the Whitney was hosting the American\nCentury show? \u2013 is at the heart of this tension between representationalism and\nmodernism. As is well known, Hopper painted many scenes without people (Drug\nStore, 1927, Manhattan Bridge Loop, 1928, and Approaching a City, 1946, for\nexample) but even in populated scenes the people in the diner in Nighthawks\n(1942) or the couple in the truly despairing work, Hotel by a Railroad (1952), barely\ncommunicate. This lack of communication is, though, part of a more general\n130 Review Essay\nediting out of other in-betweens which representationalism includes ; indeed,\ndepends on. Between the sketches and the finished paintings, Dawn in Pennsylvania\n(1942) and Hotel Lobby (1943), Hopper removed, respectively, the details of a\nstation platform and additional figures from the lobby, together with most signs\nof interaction between those who remain. The modernist architect Mies van der\nRohe famously coined the pronouncement \u2018\u2018 less is more \u2019\u2019 and this could well be\na reminder to notice the overlooked modernist elements in Hopper, that most\nrealist of American artists.\nParadoxically, as Hopper the realist edits out reality so the work of the leading\nAmerican modernist of the pre-war period, Stuart Davis, gets more and more full\nbut within an abstract argot. Davis\u2019s was not the non-objectivity practised and\ntheorised by Kandinsky but, rather, a painterly technique derived from collage.\nIn Lucky Strike (1921) and New York Mural (1932), as in much of his work, Davis\nincludes not the signs of an urban society \u2013 as in collage \u2013 but painted signs. His\nis almost a still-life technique but adapted to a consumer-culture which has\nemptied out the content of objects while leaving their form intact. Within that\npainted culture, as Davis saw it, a pipe, a ticket machine, a brown derby, a gas\npump, and images and words from packaging all match skyscrapers and sections\nof the El for size and so inhabit each other\u2019s space. In the mural Swing Landscape\n(1938), Davis even succeeded in painting abstractly when employed by the Works\nProgress Administration\u2019s Federal Arts Project, with its orthodoxy of New Deal\nrealism. As the claims that painting could convey three-dimensional space gave\nway under the combined impact of the various modernisms, not to mention the\nchallenge of still and then moving photographs, so Davis opted for the\nalternative basis for modernist art, namely that it responds to its time using\nwhatever techniques seem appropriate. One might say the same of Andy Warhol\nbut the results could not be more different.\nThe remaining point of tension brought out by the Whitney\u2019s two-part\nexhibition centres on the human figure. Across the one hundred years of art there\nis a great deal of fragmention, flattening, deconstruction, and abandoning of the\nhuman figure, whether in Willem de Kooning\u2019s Woman series, Pop Art, Cindy\nSherman\u2019s photographs or the various minimalisms of the post-abstract\nexpressionist period; or even in the way Hopper paints the skin of his human\nfigures (he really is the centre of The American Century and, alone, managed to\nappear in both parts of the exhibition). Yet The American Century still gives plenty\nof emphasis to people-centred art. Unlike the curators of the Royal Academy\u2019s\nvery Europe-oriented American Art in the Twentieth Century (1993), Barbara\nHaskell gives due weight to the Ashcan School in the years before the Armory\nshow. Hopper\u2019s art comes next and, if he drops the communal humanity which\nis so unconvincingly celebrated by his contemporaries, the American Scene\npainters, he yet retains an interest in a few human figures who are perhaps most\ncompelling as their relations with others break down (that sickening skin-colour\nmust signify something!). Then, part way through the second half of The\nAmerican Century, just as Brad and his friends seem to signal the end of seeing in\nthe round, comes arguably the most startling moment in the whole exhibition.\nDuring one visit the attention of a small crowd was expertly drawn by a docent\nto Lichtenstein\u2019s highly parodic works, but one by one almost everyone in the\nReview Essay 131\ngallery realised that the old lady standing behind them, burdened with shopping\nbags was not real. The Shopper is lifesize, has real human hair, and she (it is\nimpossible not to refer to Duane Hanson\u2019s art-work in any other way) had a sense\nof weariness beyond that of shopping fatigue. Even if one had been expecting to\ncome across a Duane Hanson somewhere in the exhibition, the shock of the real\nwas tangible. Someone looked into her shopping bags. Quite a few people peered\ninto her eyes. Others checked whether the nearby Museum attendant was real.\nArguably, no other art work in the exhibition, however disturbing, produced the\nsame level of reaction as this now somewhat dated sculpture : and it could not\nhave been other than a response to the ordinariness of the human condition\nfocussed on a representation of the human body. Something of the extra-\nordinariness of the human condition, seen through the body, can be glimpsed in\nBill Viola\u2019s video}sound installation, The Crossing (1996). At the Stedelikj\nMuseum in Amsterdam in 1998, for instance, the frameless image of a man being\ndeluged by water, beginning with an isolated drop, and, round the \u2018\u2018back\u2019\u2019 of the\nscreen, being consumed by fire, beginning with a small flame breaking out on the\nground beside him, was projected at the top of the stairway to the first floor.\nPeople stood for lengthy periods at the foot of the stairs, walked up the stairs\nequally transfixed as the show was replayed, and watched it from \u2018\u2018behind. \u2019\u2019\nAnyone who had seen The Crossing and who then queued up, a little\napprehensively, near the end of the American Century exhibition to see Viola\u2019s Tree\nof Knowledge could be forgiven for thinking that the figure at the far end of the\ncorridor silhouetted against the interactive tree was another of Viola\u2019s stunning\nprojected images. It turned out to be the person currently experiencing the show\nand soon to be replaced by oneself.\n"}
