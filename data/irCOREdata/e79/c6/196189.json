SNELL*\nAfter earlier discussion by the Webbs, Dorothy Marshall, Hampson and\nother Poor Law historians, the administration of parish settlement has\nbeen rather neglected in recent years. And so one welcomes the recent\nlocal study in this journal by Landau, 'The laws of settlement and the\nsurveillance of immigration in eighteenth-century Kent', as promoting\nfurther exploration of a complex subject which was of some importance\nto contemporaries.1 However, the characterization of pauper settlement in\nher article seems ill-judged, and the emphasis in her outline of the nature\nand purpose of settlement is misleading. To assess her arguments requires\ndiscussion of some legalistic, logical and technical problems in her article\n(and these may not engage all readers); but I shall also take her account\nas a cue for pointing the way to a more balanced analysis of settlement,\nwhich may be of wider interest.\nLandau covers eighteenth-century petty sessional records in Kent. Her\nargument is not always clear, and sometimes seems contradictory; it is\noften based on surmise rather than direct evidence. The essence of it is\nstated to be: ' that parishes applied the settlement laws as Parliament had\nintended - that is, to monitor and regulate immigration - and that rural\nparishes did so vigorously until 1795, when change in the law made such\nactivity impossible. Therefore, this article questions Snell's assumption in\nAnnals of the labouring poor, that almost all settlement examinations were\ngenerated as part of an application for poor relief.'2\nI shall outline other aspects of her argument shortly. Let me first note\nthat in this and other such statements she does not summarize my views\n* Department of English Local History, University of Leicester\n375\nK. D. M. SNELL\naccurately. Indeed, I made much mention of the contemporary ' likely to\nbe chargeable' category of the poor, of which more below. I also argued\nthat those examined (whether 'chargeable' or not) were generally\nunemployed - this is not the same as saying they were almost always\napplying for relief. Further, in calculating rural seasonal distributions of\nunemployment (one of many uses for settlement examinations), certain\ncategories were excluded, because for various reasons it was possible that\ntheir examinations were not directly due to rural 'unemployment' of the\nsort that interested me.3 Landau appears to have overlooked the\nqualifications I made covering those cases for which examination may not\nprovide the date of chargeability,4 and the fact that when dealing with\nseasonality I was concerned with rural parishes and workers - not urban\nones and market towns. No such distinctions exist in her article. Her\nfigures are both urban and rural, and make no effort to distinguish\noccupations. They are therefore not comparable to the parts of my book\nwhich covered rural seasonality by using settlement records; nor does her\ndiscussion have any bearing on all my other uses of settlement records.\nFor such reasons, it seems to me that her argument is largely irrelevant to\nmy own use of settlement data.\nLandau depicts Annals of the labouring poor as a book with a thesis on\nthe settlement laws. In no way was it such. My detailed arguments on that\nhave yet to be published, and my book never set up what Landau calls\n'prevailing views on the administration of the laws of settlement'.5 Hence\nshe proceeds in the unusual fashion of trying to deduce that I hold certain\n'assumptions' or 'premises'. It is these 'assumptions' that she refers to:\nin her words, that' a settlement examination was merely the equivalent of\nan application for poor relief':6 or the 'assumption that supervision of\nmigrants had little to do with the laws' application';7 or 'that the\nsettlement laws were applied only to the indigent '8 - despite the fact that\nthey were never made in such a crude and unqualified form by me, nor by\nany other settlement historian. In fact, Annals of the labouring poor used\nselected biographical details in certain settlement records - and I did not\nuse certificates - to discuss features of rural life and poverty, like wages,\nfarm service, women's work, rural unemployment, the family, ap-\nprenticeship and so on. These were its subjects - not administration of the\nsettlement laws. Had I intended an outline of the latter, it would have\nbeen a totally different book, using all types of settlement document.\n376\nPAUPER SETTLEMENT AND POOR RELIEF\nUnlike that book however, Landau makes strong generalizations about\nthe nature and purpose of pauper settlement, which we should consider.\nShe repeatedly asserts that the settlement laws were to regulate or\n'monitor' migration: that that was their Parliamentarily ordained\npurpose, and that was in practice how and why they operated. She writes\nthat 'The laws of settlement, enacted between 1662 and 1697, created a\nlegal framework which allowed parish officials to supervise and regulate\nmigration' ;9 and ' the settlement laws were designed to allow parishes to\nexercise control over immigration '.10 To her, this above all is the meaning\nof the settlement laws; indeed, she claims tha t ' such surveillance is what\nParliament both intended and assumed when it enacted the settlement\nlaws'.11 Such regulation and supervision of mobility was, she argues,\n'vigorous' and very effective, done with 'assiduity' from 1662 till 1795,\nenforced by JPs with this intention.12 Given this supposed purpose of\nsettlement law, she hints that any use of its records (like examinations or\nremoval orders) to study aspects of pauperism may be misplaced. She feels\nthat the timing of these documents was just a matter of administrative\nconvenience, unrelated to the seasonality of pauperism in different\nagrarian regions. Settlement records should, apparently, point the way not\nto an understanding of poverty, unemployment and 'chargeability', but\nrather to what she claims they were designed for: how 'immigration' was\nvigorously 'monitored'.\nThis is an unusual approach to the subject. Furthermore, the argument\nwould clearly pose problems for views of eighteenth-century English\nsociety as very mobile, individualistic, with an active labour market.\nSettlement is clearly important for such issues. One can understand that\nLandau, a historian of the upper reaches of judicial administration and\npolitics in eighteenth-century Kent, might magnify the role of JPs and\nexpress such views. It seems to me that such strong emphasis is\nunfounded. Let me start by stressing the most axiomatic point about\npauper settlement, which Landau has completely by-passed. All con-\ntemporary definitions of the settlement laws - in statute, in the manuals of\noverseers, JPs or guardians, in legal cases, in contemporary pamphlets, in\nSelect Committees on settlement and irremovability, as well as the\ndefinitions by Poor Law and settlement historians - emphasize the\nfollowing crucial point. Pauper 'settlement' related above all to the rights\nof the poor to poor relief in certain parishes. It was the almost inevitable\ncorollary of a parochial system of poor relief and rating, as codified in the\nElizabethan statutes, as practised long before 1662, and long after the\neighteenth century.13 (The legal system of settlement stretched far before\n377\nK. D. M. SNELL\nand after the limited period Landau discusses. It ought to be understood\nin relation to its proper time span, and the seventy or more statutes\ncomprising it, rather than the few she mentions.) When one looks into\nthe reasons for the law's growth, and for its decline, it is clear that it was\nintimately connected with poor-relief administration, and the scale of that\nadministration.14 Settlement law became increasingly redundant as and\nbecause England and Wales moved gradually towards a national welfare\nsystem. This occurred particularly from the second half of the nineteenth\ncentury (with union chargeability), although pauper settlement lasted\neven until the mid-twentieth century, when a national system was finally\nestablished. As Steer's parish law defined it:\n'Settlement, Definition of. A Settlement is the right acquired in any one of the modes pointed\nout by the poor laws, to become a recipient of the benefit of those laws, in that parish or place\nwhich provides for its own poor, where the right has been last acquired'.15\nAmong many others, here was James Shaw's definition: 'Settlement is\nthat right which a parishioner becoming impotent or poor has of claiming\nrelief from the funds raised by means of the poor's rate, by virtue of the\nsocial relationship or connection which subsists between him and the other\nmembers of the parish. This right is always acquired in that parish or place\nin which parishioners have acquired their last legal settlement.n6\nA settlement, wrote Sir Edmund Head, 'was considered necessary to\nconfer a right to relief... the settlement... represents an ultimate ob-\nligation on the part of a particular parish to defray the cost of whatever\nrelief the pauper who is settled in it may require'.17\nIn accordance with this, a settlement place was defined, for example by\nM. Nolan, as follows: 'A place of settlement may be defined [as] a district\nmaintaining its poor, to which persons become removable for the\npurposes of obtaining the relief given by 43 Eliz. c.2.n8\nThis accepted definition of pauper settlement, from at least 1662 until\nthe later nineteenth century, is contrary to the one Landau presents. It has\nalways been given by historians, and there has hitherto never been any\ndebate about this.19 The parliamentary debates, statutes and other sources\nplace no emphasis on settlement being primarily the right of officials to\n'monitor' or 'supervise' migration or 'immigration'. Nor is there much\nsupport for her stress that 'such surveillance is what Parliament both\nintended and assumed when it enacted the settlement laws'.20 Landau\ncompletely ignores the huge numbers stated to be actually chargeable. She\nis mistaken to criticize strong connections made between settlement and\npoor relief, as she does, or premises 'linking examination to indigence'.\nHer failure to acknowledge the crux of settlement renders her thesis\ndubious and unbalanced.\n378\nPAUPER SETTLEMENT AND POOR RELIEF\nLandau's constantly emphasized term 'monitoring migration' or\n'immigration' appears simplistic, especially in the motives it imputes. She\nhardly touches on the real complexities of the subject: its relation to the\nrelief of poverty, its implications for the working of local government over\ntime, its local and regional dimensions, its urban-rural contrasts and\npoints of conflict, its political implications in different periods, its\nconnection with poor law and rating reform, its relation to vagrancy and\nalien law, and so on. Of course, nobody would suggest that the settlement\nlaws did not have considerable significance for the mobility and habitation\nof the population. Nor have I or other settlement historians 'completely\ndismissed] the problem of the relation of [settlement] sources to the\nsupervision of migration'.21 Far from it. It is well known that these laws\ncould influence the situation of people, and were sometimes so used, as\nthose of us who study so-called 'open' and 'close' parishes are aware. Any\nreading of the huge government reports on settlement makes this\nabundantly clear. One needs to ask why some people wished to influence\nsettlement. Settlement was crucial because with it came eligibility to poor\nrelief: the right of the poor to poor relief when they needed it, where they\nwere eligible for it. That axiomatic definition is the 'assumption'\nunderlying my understanding of settlement in Annals of the labouring\npoor, and my careful use of certain settlement records. Of course those\nrecords bear crucially on poverty, pauperism, chargeability (the term they\nconstantly repeat throughout the period) and poor relief.22 They were\ninextricably coupled to them, as all contemporaries knew, and with those\nhuman situations relating to them, particularly 'unemployment'.23\nSettlement law was referred to in statute as 'The Laws relating to the\nSettlement, Employment, and Relief of the Poor',24 indicating the\nintimate association of these three matters. The 1662 Act, which laid the\nbasis for much settlement law, was in fact entitled 'An act for the better\nrelief of the poor of this kingdom'. Settlement law was commonly called\n'The law for the relief of the poor'.25\nII\nSo much for Landau's main argument, which presented an alternative\nview of the overall nature of settlement law and its operation. Let me now\ndiscuss some further misapprehensions, which may stem from her initial\nemphasis.\nMany historians are increasingly concerned with language and its\nhistorical signification. Like literary critics, they are becoming more aware\nof how illuminating such historical language is of practice, and how\ninattention to historical usage can lead one astray. It is appropriate to\n379\n13 CON 6\nK. D. M. SNELL\ncomment upon Landau's continual use of the words 'immigration',\n'immigrant', and 'immigrate', as used prominently in her title (alongside\nthe accompanying word 'surveillance'. All their barrier and 'monitoring'\nconnotations are integral to her notion of settlement.\nLandau persistently calls people 'immigrants', even though many of\nthese were long resident in the parish of their residence, more so than\nmany who were legally settled there. This vocabulary is largely\nanachronistic for most of her period. The common English usage came\nlater. The Etymological dictionary of the English language says that 'The\nverb [to immigrate] is quite modern', suggesting nineteenth-century\nusage.26 It was still not in common use in the eighteenth century. I do not\nfind it in contemporary discussion of settlement until the nineteenth-\ncentury Irish influx. 'Immigration' came into general use later than the\nverb, and, like the term 'immigrant', that use was probably American in\norigin. The Oxford English dictionary speaks of 'immigrant', in an early\nreference dated 1809, as 'perhaps the only new word, of which the\ncircumstances of the United States has in any degree demanded the\naddition to the English language'. Dictionary references to Landau's key\nwords are overwhelmingly nineteenth and twentieth-century, very often\nAmerican, and they relate to national immigration. (From the nineteenth\ncentury 'immigrant' slowly (but never fully) eclipses the earlier word\n'alien'.) Landau's use of a language mismatched to historical cir-\ncumstances, with inappropriate connotations, seems to me anachron-\nistically to misrepresent issues of parish settlement from the start. A\nnumber of terms were used in connection with English parochial\nsettlement, and the most common was that of 'sojourner', which has\ndifferent (and more temporary) implications - ones contrary to Landau's\nargument, implying even an expectancy of movement.\nin\nLet us turn to the evidence itself. Because Landau uses Kent petty-session\nrecords, some observations are needed on sources and their use. She states\nthat 'parish records' of settlement are 'perverse', indeed 'bedevilled', and\nthat they have 'provoked some rather impatient responses'.27 It is not\nclear what she means by that, and my own research has in many counties\nused both 'parish' and 'petty-session' settlement records, including her\nown Kentish material. Such 'parish' records would be problematic in this\ncontext only if she can show (with regard to specific usages, like\nseasonality) that they are unrepresentative of the total settlement cases\nconducted, which she cannot. Indeed, we will see that such 'parish\nrecords' are often ' petty-session' records - the ones Landau uses.\n380\nPAUPER SETTLEMENT AND POOR RELIEF\n'Petty sessions' were by no means always a monthly meeting (justices\nfrequently met more often), and were less formalized outside Kent than\nLandau suggests. For a long period they very often amounted to 'causal\npairs of justices meeting when and where they chose', as the Webbs put\nit.28 Their records are frequently irregular, and often do not survive\nbecause they had little facility for keeping them. It is well known that Kent\nis unusual in its petty-session records, raising questions of representa-\ntiveness over them and over research on administration based on them.29\nNor has it been established that petty sessions throughout the country\ndealt with 'a very large proportion of settlement business', especially\nexamining.30 Landau calculates the ratio of appealed removal orders to all\nremoval orders, on the assumption that petty-session records encompass\nall (or virtually all) removals. However, this ratio cannot be accurately\nascertained in the way she hopes.31 In fact, it is not at all clear how far\nchanges in her graphs32 are due to shifting use and definition of 'petty\nsessions'. Furthermore, just as Quarter Session cases for many reasons\nrepresent an atypical sample of total cases, it could be argued that for the\nmore questionable and potentially costly cases, where appeal might arise,\nparishes would be more likely to have the examination conducted at petty\nsessions.33 Hence her statement that 'the majority of removal orders\nappealed to Quarter Sessions were signed at petty sessions' could be true34\n-but her subsequent deductions from that about the encompassing\nadministrative role of petty sessions by no means necessarily follow, even\nin Kent.\nLandau also tries to compare 'parish records' with those of 'petty\nsessions', to argue that 'the majority of removal orders were signed at\npetty sessions'.35 If this was so for almost all cases, some of her deductions\nmight be more credible. However, this is not a procedure one can adopt.\nFor in most record collections, one has no way of telling how, and from\nwhere, records came to be in the 'parish' collections. In some cases\nmultiple copies originated in ' petty sessions' - but these were removed by\noverseers (if conducted outside the parish), for they might otherwise have\nbeen lost. They were needed by parish officers and might often not be\nstored elsewhere. Such documents would very early on have been placed\nwith so-called 'parish records' (upon which Landau casts aspersions, not\nnoticing that she thereby casts aspersions on her own class of record).36\nThey would since have been catalogued accordingly. In many cases this\nundoubtedly took place. Where a removal occurred (which may have\ninvolved a predisposition to petty sessions for examination) the documents\nwould commonly be split between the two parishes involved - ending up\nin different parish collections and so enhancing survival chances. And\nentries in a petty-session minute book would survive in their entirety if the\n381\n13-2\nK. D. M. SNELL\nbook itself survived. However, 'parish' records originating outside 'petty\nsessions' would be more subject to progressive loss over time. Such\nrecords would be a subset of total 'parish' records, the other 'parish'\nrecords really being 'petty-session' records in origin.\nThere are certainly reasons therefore to suspect that original 'petty-\nsession ' records might have greater survival chances than genuine' parish'\nrecords of a similar type. Further, more copies would sometimes be made,\nan additional copy for justices, and the latter document would often find\nits way into ' parish' records, given the history of archiving. The relative\nodds are stacked against original 'parish' records (those taken outside\nanything loosely called 'petty sessions') surviving - they progressively\nbecame a smaller percentage of total documented cases (including petty-\nsession minute-book entries) over time. Hence Landau's calculations\nbased upon comparison of arbitrarily divided 'parish' and 'petty-session'\nrecords are open to question. Methods like this have not previously been\nused on regions with good ' petty-session' survival for the reasons I give.37\nIV.\nLandau's opening account of the basis for settlement and removal is\nincomplete, mentioning only one denotation of renting for \u00a310 per\nannum, and possession of freehold estate.38 As a way of gaining settlement\nand avoiding removal, these were entirely outnumbered (especially in the\nrural context) by those cases where settlement was gained by yearly\nservice, apprenticeship, parentage, marriage for a woman (in practice the\nfour major ways of becoming settled), serving certain offices, paying\nparish taxes, and birth. The widespread yearly hiring and apprenticeship\ninto parishes, which Landau omits, involved contracts which, like\nmarriage, would be difficult for parish officers to break. These most\nimportant of the 'heads' of settlement, perhaps referring to the most\nmobile of the population,39 render very suspect such a strong argument for\nfrequent supervisory control over 'immigration'.\nIn fact Landau's own sources and data closely considered do not show\nthat removal happened 'frequently' at all. Nor do they show that parish\noverseers were bent on 'vigorous' 'surveillance', examining the 'im-\nmigrant ' poor' en masse' at petty sessions, and so on, even when they did\nnot intend removing them.40 Landau is not prepared in her article to allow\nthat settlement business of any magnitude took place outside Kent petty\nsessions.41 For her petty-session divisions (each comprising 'about one\ndozen to three dozen parishes'),421 calculate an average of just under 13\nremoval orders per annum for the years for which she provided data. In\n382\nPAUPER SETTLEMENT AND POOR RELIEF\nother years the figures may be even less. These figures then average down\nto between only 0.3 to 1.2 removal per parish for each year! This parish\naverage has also been raised considerably by the small towns she\nincludes.43 Needless to say, this is extremely low, far lower than in-\nmigration figures. The examinations also make it clear that many of those\nexamined had been long resident in the parish concerned, and had only\njust become chargeable, or 'likely to become chargeable' (i.e., they were\nnot recent 'immigrants')- These points are completely contrary to\nLandau's claims for 'quite unsuspected' and 'vigorous' 'monitoring' of\n'immigration' at petty sessions. Together with the definition of settlement,\nthey make me very dubious about the main parts of her argument.\nLet me assess the contemporary term 'likely to be chargeable', and issues\nrelating to this. This bears on an aspect of the settlement laws in the pre-\n1795 period, when people could be removed for this reason as well as for\nactual chargeability. It is helpful to appraise how this term was used, and\nwhether people so designated were generally unemployed.\nMy analysis of rural records over many counties shows that the regional\nseasonalities of those 'likely to be chargeable' are virtually identical to\nthose of the many people actually chargeable. Seasonally varies by region\nof course, between, for example, arable, pastoral, or certain cottage-\nindustrial areas. The documentary distinction can easily be made, and\nsuggests that parish officers were commonly interpreting the two terms in\na similar way. Many hand-written removal orders, as well as examinations,\nbear this out, suggesting what was in practice meant by the phrase in\nquestion. They virtually never mention a \u00a310 renting threshold by way of\njustifying removal.44 Instead, people 'likely to be chargeable' were very\nfrequently described in words like 'was this day taken wandering in the\nsaid parish of Donnington where he was likely to become chargeable', or\n' was found wandering in the said parish being reduced to great distress',\nor ' lately intruded himself into the said parish, in great distress and there\nlikely to become chargeable'. 'Likely to become chargeable' was very\noften followed by 'if not timely prevented'. A common printed form was\nto give the name, adding ' being reduced to great poverty' - the details of\nwhether 'likely to be' or actually 'chargeable' to be added for each case.\nIt is unlikely that removal of these paupers arose from a desire to\n'monitor' their migration. Would this really have led the same JPs to send\nthem in alternate numbers back and forth across parish boundaries, as if\na motiveless game of draughts was being played, the human pieces usually\nstaying on the same local board? Rather, one should emphasize that the\n383\nK. D. M. SNELL\nmain concern had to do with providing poor relief in each person's parish\nof settlement.\nIn some cases unsavoury characters were ejected. The vagrancy laws\nusually dealt with these. (It was often preferable to class someone as a\nvagrant).45 Sometimes people were removed (or removal threatened) and\nthey returned with a settlement certificate, which often meant the\naccompaniment of non-resident relief.46 Such non-resident relief was\ncertainly being given from the late seventeenth century, as parish\ncorrespondence shows, and it existed earlier still. It was given to men more\noften than women. The certificate also meant that people would not be\nsubject to punitive measures under the vagrancy laws for returning to the\nplace from which they had been removed. Hence there is no logic in\nLandau's inference that men returning with certificates shows that they\nwere not indigent when the order against them was issued.47\nGenerally speaking, those 'likely to be chargeable' were in poverty, in\nimminent need of relief, often reluctant to apply for it in a parish where\nthey were not settled, and this is how they were commonly perceived. In\njudicial usage ' likely to become chargeable' did not mean persons with a\n'possibility' of becoming chargeable, or who 'may' become chargeable,\nbut rather those 'likely' or with a 'probability' of being chargeable.\n'There is as much difference in this case between may and likely, as\nbetween a possibility and a probability', wrote R. Burn.48 Hence the\ninextricably related poor and settlement laws came into effect. These were\nusually vulnerable people, without secure livelihood, looking for work,\nfinding themselves this way at the same economically inactive time of the\nyear as those actually chargeable, for much the same reasons.\nOne would expect to find abundant cases of people in employment if\nLandau was correct about examinations being a form of'monitoring' or\n'surveillance'-and examinations contain many details about past\nemployment, including short-term work.49 For obvious reasons, mention\nof current employment would be a major element in 'surveillance', if that\nwas the intention. And yet I have found only a minute proportion of\nexaminations where a person seems to be in employment. The cir-\ncumstances of these were usually atypical - for example a broken leg, or\nsmallpox, affecting a covenant farm servant - and even these may already\nhave been dismissed by their employers.50 Servants could not be removed\nfrom masters. Even in bastardy or impending bastardy cases, overseers\ncould not act against an unmarried servant unless she had first been\ndischarged by her master\/mistress (i.e., been made 'unemployed').\nOverseers could not remove someone out of service even on account of\nbastardy.51\nThe 1662 Act had expressly provided for people 'to go into any county,\n384\nPAUPER SETTLEMENT AND POOR RELIEF\nparish, or place, to work in time of harvest, or at any time to work at any\nother work'. This was in the spirit of the post-1662 settlement laws, and\nwas well established in common law for all who were not rogues and\nvagabonds. It was also in the interests of local employers, who would not\nusually act against people while they had work for them. Of course, with\nsome haphazard enforcement, people were sometimes unnecessarily\ndeemed 'likely to be chargeable', and removed despite having some local\nprospects. These can usually be eliminated from rural seasonality\ncalculations if appropriate. One does not find many rural documentary\nexamples, however. Throughout the country they were far outnumbered\nby chargeable people and cases of genuine hardship, referred to as ' likely\nto be chargeable' in the sense defined above. Threatening an examination\nitself would often incline people to move on, if they were not indigent.\nFurther, those actually chargeable were an enormous group before 1795.\nMany printed removal order forms assumed them to be the subject of\nproceedings, in the printed wording used. Reading very large numbers of\nexaminations and accompanying documentation, and testing between\ndifferent types and divisions of document to see whether their seasonal\npatterns and other features are mutually supportive, one is repeatedly\nstruck by examinations' and removal orders' connection with charge-\nability, poverty and relief eligibility.\nFurthermore, once deemed 'likely to be chargeable', people became\nimmediately chargeable. Their probably unemployed situation in the rural\nparishes had generally been very little different from that of those who\nwere actually chargeable; and from the moment of examination both\ngroups were in the same position of chargeabihty.' Likely to be chargeable'\nshould be assessed in relation to the narrow definition of 'actually\nchargeable' - a definition that brought variously enforced penalties on\npaupers, like badging, liability to have their children bound to sea service,\nand so on. Asking for relief did not amount to chargeabihty. Seeking alms\nlocally did not either, nor did receiving money from parish charities or the\nmany seasonal doleings. 'Chargeable' meant 'an actual charge and\nburthen to the parish', as Nolan put it, that is, a charge specifically to\nparish poor rates.52 In effect, 'likely to be chargeable' was an immediately\nself-fulfilling statement, starting with the charges on the parish of having\nit written, and then the costs (however temporary) of maintenance, and of\nremoval. The removal order for paupers who were' likely to be chargeable'\n-just as for 'chargeable' paupers - ordered the receiving parish's\nchurchwardens and overseers to provide for them according to the laws\nfor the relief of the poor. Such officers would be indicted at Quarter\nSessions and fined if they did not receive and provide for the removed\npauper(s).53 The removing parish's officers were to deliver the pauper(s)\n385\nK. D. M. SNELL\n'to the Churchwardens and Overseers of the Poor' in the receiving parish,\nwho ' are hereby required to receive [names of paupers] and to provide for\nthem according to the Law [the Poor Law] in that case made and\nprovided', as the standard form put it. This was one way in which\nchargeability occurred in the period under discussion, as well as resident\nor non-resident relief being solicited and obtained from the parish of\nresidence and\/or settlement. It may seem a paternalistic origin for\nchargeability, but the taking of incipient paupers in hand was not done\nunnecessarily, and was a costly alternative. Such cases were undeniably an\nelement in the contemporary meaning and experience of pauperism,\nchargeability and 'unemployment'. Many such cases were of people in a\nstrange parish, who, lacking a settlement there, and faced with the\ndeterrent of possible examination and removal, were naturally reluctant to\napply for the relief they needed.54\nOne can also note that cases where someone was examined, and very\noften removed at much cost, because' likely to be chargeable', indicate the\ndating of when that person became chargeable, as much so as the other\ncases where the pauper was actually chargeable. Nolan wrote: 'An order\nof removal [of whatever sort] is in effect likewise an order of maintenance;\nfor it not only directs the party to be removed to his place of settlement,\nbut also that he shall be received and provided for there'.55 As well as the\ncosts to the removing parish of examining and removing the pauper family\nand their possessions, which it assuredly did not welcome and which were\na very strong disincentive to act (these costs could often far exceed relief\npayments), it was the case that 'heavy expences might, and usually were\nincurred by the parish to which the removal was made, in maintaining the\npaupers'.56\nVI\nLet me assess a related issue. Landau argues that the 1795 Settlement Act\ncaused a marked change in the composition of those removed: it made\nwomen a 'markedly larger proportion of those subjected to removal'. She\nwrites this on the basis of data for a few very atypical high-price war years\n(1796-1799), in just one petty-session division. From such data, she\nagain surmises that many people who had hitherto been removed cannot\nhave been destitute - so she infers that they must have been 'monitored'.\nHer point is badly documented and incorrect nationally.57 Using my much\nlarger aggregate figures from almost all counties, there is not much change\nin the sexual composition of those examined and\/or removed, 1700\u2014\n1865; and changes are only discernible by using smoothed data. A small\nupward shift in the proportion female is found in the first half of the\ninflationary Napoleonic Wars: testimony to the precarious circumstances\n386\nPAUPER SETTLEMENT AND POOR RELIEF\nof women and families whose husbands were in the forces.58 The\nexaminations of many such women make this very clear. And yet this\nslight rise in the proportion female merely returns to levels found in the\nfirst half of the eighteenth century. (There had been a gradual and slight\ndecline in the proportion female between c. 1740 and c. 1770.) A small rise\nin the proportion female was also a function of the comparatively secure\nemployment for men during the Napoleonic Wars, and the poverty-\ninducing effects on widowed or separated women of the rising fertility of\nthe time. It was also related to the rise of illegitimacy, itself much\naggravated by wartime conditions. The proportion examined and\/or\nremoved who were women then falls again to typical eighteenth-century\nlevels after 1815. There is another small peak c. 1832-but again, the\nproportions are no higher than those of the early to mid-eighteenth\ncentury.591 have outlined elsewhere the increasingly insecure situation of\nwomen relative to men over this period, as a feature of a growing sexual\ndivision of labour. This has some unknown influence on data of this sort.60\nFigures on the sexual incidence of removal cannot possibly make\nLandau's point, even when they are reliably calculated, and even if they\nshowed (which they do not) the abrupt change after 1795 she hopes of\nthem.\nSome people were undoubtedly examined in their parishes of settlement,\nand no one doubts this. However, Landau repeats this, and from it infers\nthat such practice 'indicates that parish officers took action under the\nsettlement laws even when immigrants were not destitute \\61 Some of the\ncases I exclude, like bastard bearers, may indeed not have been destitute.\nBut examples of examination in one's settlement place cannot support\nLandau's point. Parish officers were usually checking on eligibility for\nrelief in that parish of claimants or of those in a hard way. Much poor\nrelief was of a very occasional nature, even given to casual poor and others\nnot settled. People found to be settled elsewhere might be removed, they\nmight move voluntarily, they might be allowed to stay if employment\nlooked likely in the immediate future, they might often obtain non-\nresident relief from their own parishes, and so on. There were many\noptions in dealing with those settled elsewhere. And those found to be\nexamined in their settlement could not be removed. Examination in one's\nsettlement when chargeable or likely to become so itself of course suggests\nthe absence of prior 'monitoring'. Furthermore, Landau sets up as a\ntarget 'proponents of the hypothesis that examination usually meant\nremoval' - although in fact no one has felt the need to assess such an issue\nin any detail.62 And I can see no justification at all for her inference that\nthe particular phenomenon she discusses here 'is indicative of subjection\nof immigrants who were not indigent to the laws of settlement'.63\n387\nK. D. M. SNELL\nLandau also argues that a lower proportion of examined Kentish male\n'immigrants' were removed than was the case for women and children.64\nTherefore, she surmises, ' a very large proportion of the immigrant males\nbrought to petty sessions were not destitute'. One must question her logic,\nfor policies on actual removal varied by sex regardless of destitution.\nSome men would be given non-resident relief, or settlement certificates,\nallowing them to stay - this was rarer for women. Men might very\ntemporarily be chargeable with some local prospects - as such they might\nbe allowed to stay. There would be some, temporarily in hardship, who\ncould be marriageable and hence beneficial to the parish if settled\nelsewhere - they could marry locally settled women, who would then take\ntheir husbands' settlements. A parish might wish to retain such men.\nMales suffering hardship could be more economically useful in the near\nfuture than chargeable women. Other men examined would leave without\na removal, and would try to find for themselves elsewhere, and so on.\nConsiderations like these were less practicable when dealing with women,\nwho might be more likely to be removed after examination. Parish actions\nwere variously influenced, and at different times, by the sex of a pauper;\nand paupers themselves would have different options open, depending\npartly on their sex. One simply cannot infer any conclusions about\nwhether people were destitute or not from sex-specific proportions of this\nkind.\nWithout discussing the quality of the accounts, Landau writes that\nthere is no 'correspondence' between paupers examined and those entered\nin six overseers' accounts.65 Hence, she claims, they were not 'destitute'.\nThis is despite the fact that very many paupers were stated to be actually\nchargeable when examined or removed, including from her parishes.66 Her\nKent parishes on average have only about one examination per annum,\nand this alone would explain problems in finding entries. In my experience\nof checking those examined against poor-law accounts, it is clear that\nsome parishes certainly entered them in accounts, and that other parishes\nseem to have done so less systematically. It cannot be stressed too strongly\nthat parish relief was a variable, often changing, practice, with many\ndifferent policies operating across parishes and time.67\nAccounts vary in quality and take different forms. This is certainly true\nof the ones Landau used, some of which are of poor documentary quality.\nMany accounts are inadequate for this purpose. It is not surprising if even\nsome very detailed accounts contain no such entries. Some paupers\ntemporarily 'chargeable', pending possible removal, were paid 'casual' or\noccasional relief, with cryptic entries and names not mentioned; or they\nwere paid a small sum from parish charities, rather than the rates. Paupers\nwere sometimes given something by churchwardens, separately accounted.\n388\nPAUPER SETTLEMENT AND POOR RELIEF\nPaupers were often temporarily lodged in a parish ' workhouse', or with\nparishioners, the costs subsumed in accounting, or paid to a host family.\nOthers were given relief in kind, often not entered in accounts. Many\nparishes removed immediately upon chargeability without giving notice -\nthis was much complained about, and later reformed. There are parishes\nwhich declared in correspondence that it was their invariable policy. In\ncertain pre-1795 circumstances,68 and under some forms of extra-legal\nagreements between local parishes (beyond certification), the parish of\nsettlement paid removal costs - these (plus maintenance of the pauper)\nwere totalled, and sent to that parish, sometimes with the pauper. They\nwere paid back upon ' receipt' of the pauper, or at a local fair or market,\nas convenient. Overseers' entries were often made later, copying from slips\nof paper, and they often just entered sub-totals under concealed headings\nor names. There would frequently have been no need to enter anything in\nthe accounts. Landau ignores such points. And it is hard to reconcile her\nviews with the enormous numbers across the country of examined or\nremoved paupers who undeniably were stated as actually chargeable.\nNobody would claim that all rural workers were examined and removed\nimmediately they became chargeable, or became perceived as a likely\nparish burden, or that they became chargeable immediately after they\nbecame 'unemployed'. To claim this would be tantamount to saying that\nall eligible persons today register unemployed the moment they are\nthrown out of work. People have short-term hopes, pride, savings,\nrelatives to help them, and they did in the past too. Moreover, there was\noften a short lag for information to be sent to a receiving parish, after an\nexamination was taken, before a removal order was sent.89 Of course, one\nor more persons would sometimes have been examined together. This was\na rural economy where groups of people became 'unemployed' or surplus\nto employers' needs at around the same seasonal times, after the harvest,\nhaymaking, or periods of piecework; and people would often migrate\ntogether in search of work. Landau argues that examination of more than\none family sometimes occurred on the same day.70 But one should not\ninterpret this as part of a general 'monitoring' of 'immigrants'. I have\nalso long been aware of some of the Kentish instances (e.g., Shoreham in\nMarch 1708) on which Landau presumably bases her argument for\n'monitoring' of groups of people. These examples are worth discussing,\nbut I do not regard them as typical.\nIn general, I am not struck .by rural parishes conducting multiple\nexaminations,' en masse' as she puts it, a categorization incompatible with\nher small per-annum parish figures. And the precise dating of the\ndocumentation does not bear this out: examinations for agricultural\nparishes are rarely clustered on the same day, and their distribution (when\n389\nK. D. M. SNELL\nfigures are large enough) is usually quite spread.71 In some urban parishes,\n.examining many more people, of more varied occupation, one can\ncertainly find cases of multiple examination; one would expect this\nbecause of their rather different administrations, which sometimes had to\nbe more wary of the greater problem of high (and more often one-way)\nmobility to towns.\nHowever, seasonalities from such urban parishes or small towns did not\nconcern me in Annals of the labouring poor, a book on agrarian England.72\nThose chargeable and those ' likely' to become so had the same seasonal\ndistributions (varying regionally). Removal orders showing this had very\nsimilar distributions as examinations, by sex and region. There is no doubt\nabout all those stated to be actually chargeable before 1795. (The\nadministrative means were certainly in place to deal promptly with these.)\nIn addition, a three-month moving average is appropriate to present these\nrural seasonality data, making queries about 'multiple examination'\ntrivial. Any slight forward shift in the data from this is easily tolerated,\nalthough it never shows up in the predictable harvest-time and winter\ndistributions. These reflect precisely the seasonality that Arthur Young\nand many other agricultural writers described.73 Nor does it manifest itself\nin a change before and after 1795, contrary to what Landau's argument\nwould predict.74\nFurthermore, one cannot accept a view that winter-time distributions of\nrural 'unemployment' or pauperism, shown by rural settlement exami-\nnations and removal orders, were due to nothing more than overseers\nhaving a (most unlikely) preference for doing examinations and removals\nin the winter. Landau suggests that these rural seasonal patterns have an\nadministrative cause, rather than an economic one indicative of an\nagrarian seasonality of work, poverty and pauperism, as I believe. As\nargued above, her view of settlement as separate from poor relief and\npauperism is untenable; nor does it explain the sexual differences in\nregional seasonal patterns which are evident long before 1795.75\nThe seasonality of rural pauperism is documented by many contempor-\naries and historians studying the endemic nature of rural poverty. The\nregionally varied male seasonal distributions of'unemployment' derived\nfrom settlement examinations, showing (especially in heavily arable areas)\npeaks in pauperism during the winter, low points during the harvest, a rise\nafter the calving season, and so on,76 closely and predictably fit (by region)\nwith everything that is known about past English and Welsh agrarian\neconomies. Regional settlement seasonalities closely match the regional\nseasonal distributions of poor-relief payments (another reciprocal way of\nmeasuring ' unemployment'), and the winter-time rise in other poor relief.\nThey are comprehensively supported by the widespread complaints of\n390\nPAUPER SETTLEMENT AND POOR RELIEF\nwinter unemployment by contemporaries (notably in arable areas), by\ntheir inverse relation to the marked seasonality of wage payments by sex\n(and to total days worked as calculated from labour accounts), by the\ndescriptions in Parliamentary Reports of women's employment during the\nyear, by seasonal labour protests at work shortages, by the seasonality of\nchild school attendances (affected by employment seasonality), by the\nseasonality of itinerant workers, or by the seasonality of poverty-induced\ngame-law offences. They match more modern labour-demand and\nseasonal unemployment patterns in the same agricultural regions. Their\nseasonalities vary predictably in the different arable or pastoral districts.\nThey vary over time and region by sex in a very intelligible way (before\nand after 1795), cross-checked against a variety of different sources. They\nchange with suddenness upon enclosure, particularly in the cereal-growing\neast, regardless of whether one is analysing a period before, or after,\n1795.\" The same source also produces varying seasonalities for different\nrural (and urban) artisan trades, which also tally well with what other\nsources and historians describe about such trades. Nothing in subsequent\nresearch on the varying occupational seasonalities of the rural Midlands\nand north has led me to reappraise this matter. Landau's conjecture that\nadministration explains rural settlement seasonality seems rather out of\ntouch with regional social and economic realities.\nWinter weather with its accompanying roads was hardly the time when\noverseers relished locating one or more JPs (if that was locally necessary)\nto bring paupers before. Nor did officials eagerly escort people to their\nsettlements in winter. If Landau was correct in her view of winter\nexamining until 1795, the Act of that year would manifest itself in a\nsubsequent flattening out of male seasonal patterns for arable areas. This\nis because those 'likely to become chargeable' (hitherto administratively\nreserved for the winter, she thinks) were (with minor exceptions) no longer\nsubject to examination after 1795. However, if anything the opposite is\ntrue. Settlement data suggest an intensification of seasonal patterns after\nenclosure, and (more generally) some slight accentuation of the seasonality\nof male distributions of rural unemployment into the early nineteenth\ncentury, particularly in the south-east.78 The essential continuity in the\nmale seasonal patterns is inescapable however, especially when grouping\nall rural parishes together, so that recently enclosed parishes become a\nminority of the total. Because of this, it is hard to imagine that the 1795\nlaw has much effect on such calculations. And Landau's view, if correct,\nwould work in favour of my arguments in Annals of the labouring poor.\nFor her point would predispose seasonal data to flatten out after 1795 -\nyet despite that, the data change to rather more acute seasonal patterns in\nthe early nineteenth century. Thus, my pessimistic argument on seasonal\n391\nK. D. M. SNELL\nchanges in arable areas would be strengthened if one accepted her\nremarks.79\nVII\nLandau overstates the importance of the 1795 Act at the end of her period.\nNot only does it seem to have had no effect on rural seasonalities; it also\nhad no effect on measurement of the family poverty cycle.80 Her argument\nwould strongly imply an effect on that. Nor did the Act reduce the\nnumbers of removals, as she would have to presume. I shall show\nelsewhere that national numbers of examinations and removals per\nannum, having fallen from a peak in the early to mid-1780s, then rose to\nunprecedented heights, especially after the comparatively full employment\nof the Napoleonic Wars. Further, if Landau is correct, examinations for\n'monitoring' should have gone on after 1795, indeed throughout most of\nthe nineteenth century. Given her argument, there was no reason for them\nto stop in 1795 as she presumes: the 1795 Act affected actual removal.\nHowever, there is little sign that this happened. Just as before 1795, one\nsees very close connection between examination and 'unemployment'.\nIt would be perverse that the 1795 Act was passed when it was if\nsettlement was really for the 'monitoring' of 'immigrants'. Had JPs and\ntheir associates seen settlement in this way, they would surely not have\nabandoned such a mechanism in the middle of a decade of labour unrest,\nwhen ruling elites saw Jacobins in every haystack, and tried to control the\nburgeoning Republican, trade and corresponding societies, and the spread\nof revolutionary ideas, when French armies so alarmed them, and when\nevents in Ireland might have made them especially concerned to\n'supervise' the thousands of mobile Irish in England and Wales. There do\nnot appear to have been any political protests against the 1795 Act on\nthese grounds, which could support Landau's case.81 Like the earlier Acts,\nthat of 1795 clearly linked settlement with poor relief; and the English\nsettlement\/poor-relief system remained, as always, a more effective\nprecaution against unrest than any amount of 'monitoring' could ever\nhave been.\nNineteenth-century commentators did not view the 1795 Act as\nespecially notable. While they generally saw it as a step in a desirable\ndirection, reformers usually saw it as an opportunity lost, as Piggott put\nit.82 They did not share Landau's view that the system was 'fundamentally\naltered in 1795', and nor do I.83 Editions of the pre-1795 legal manuals,\nlike Burn's, continued without fundamental change. The 1795 Act has\nsignificance, but it should not be exaggerated. Contemporaries were more\nstruck by continuity of the earlier laws into their own time. They went\nback to those laws to discuss the system, without paying particular heed\n392\nPAUPER SETTLEMENT AND POOR RELIEF\nto 1795. Piggott commented on the 1795 Act almost as if it was\nirrelevant.84 His view on continuity prevailed. It is further borne out by\ncontinuity of the late seventeenth-century ' heads' of settlement. These\nwere re-enacted surprisingly intact even in the 1927 or 1930 Poor Law\nActs. Continuity is also stressed by settlement historians.85 A more\nappropriate debate - which historians, like contemporaries, have been\nmore concerned to conduct - is the significance for settlement of the New\nPoor Law.\nTo stress even further the extent to which settlement was connected with\npauperism, further findings can be summarized. Before and after 1795,\nusing aggregate national data, there are very significant positive\ncorrelations between yearly totals of removals and examinations on the\none hand, and prices and poor-relief expenditure. The connection between\nyearly fluctuations in examinations and\/or removals and indicators of\npoverty can very securely be shown. Major price rises, accompanied by\nrising poor relief- 1709-1710, 1725, 1727-1728, 1740, 1751, 1755-1756,\n1766-1767, 1771-1774, 1782-1783, 1789, 1795, 1800-1801, 1809-1812.\n1816-were all associated with aggregate rises in the numbers of people\nexamined\/removed. This is especially striking in 1740, 1755-1756, 1773,\n1795, 1800-1801, 1809-1812 and 1816. Falling prices, and hence rising\nliving standards in the early to mid-eighteenth century (when service and\nits accompanying high mobility seem to have peaked),86 were associated\nwith low settlement activity. (Such low prices probably explain much more\nof a decline in appealed cases c. 1715-1745, in some counties, than\nLandau's emphasis on high-political activity). The well-known periods of\n'unemployment' and\/or 'pauperism' in both the eighteenth and nine-\nteenth centuries were associated with marked upturns in examinations and\nremovals. This is dramatically true of c. 1740, the mid-1760s into the early\n1770s, 1783-1786, 1800-1801 and 1814-1821. Periods of more secure\nemployment, especially in those wartime years which were not subject to\nextreme price rises (i.e., leaving aside 1740, 1795, 1800-1801, c. 1810-\n1811), witnessed lulls in examination\/removal activity.\nThe national sums expended on removals remained almost constant as\na percentage of total sums assessed and levied for the relief of the poor\nbefore and after 1795: at between 2.0-4.3 per cent. There is perhaps a very\nslight tendency for the percentage to rise from the 1776 figure. (If Landau\nwas correct, it should fall after 1795. There is no sign of this.) It is also the\ncase that per-annum sums expended nationally on removals are highly\ncorrelated with the separate sums expended for the relief of the poor (r =\n0.980, using the 1776-1815 data). This is also true of parochial\nexpenditure, where it can be judged. I will discuss these matters\nelsewhere.87 One notes again that there is no evidence to support any\n393\nK. D. M. SNELL\nargument that examinations and removals were unrelated to pauperism\nand unemployment. It is clear that there was an extremely strong\nassociation between them.\nVIII\nLet me discuss an issue which may bring evidence of pauper settlement to\nbear on political historiography. Landau uses some partial figures to\nargue that Quarter Session settlement appeals in Kent declined over time\nas a percentage of total settlement cases.88 She claims, incorrectly, that\n' the number of appeals also fell decisively and fell during the same period\nin all the other counties whose appeals have been enumerated'.89\nAccordingly, she argues, ' the expectations which impelled parish officers\nin many counties to appeal against removal orders changed markedly\nduring the reign of George I. A national alteration of expectations would\nhave been entirely logical.' Her explanation encompasses the Whigs'\n'hegemony' in the commission of the peace, high-political intrigue, the\npolitical balance of the benches, and the King.\nHowever, the 'logical' explanation for such a change is different and\nless ambitious. As more people came under the settlement laws because of\nrising rural poverty from the late eighteenth century, as the legal and other\ncosts of appeal rose considerably,90 and as parish poor-law expenditure\nescalated, parishes were often forced to economize on their appeals.\nAppeals therefore fell as a percentage of (rising) total settlement cases.91\nLandau does not advance this explanation, possibly because her high\npolitical interests forestall awareness of more mundane parish poor-law\nmatters, and because an emphasis on 'surveillance' administered by JPs\nleads her to distance pauper settlement from poor relief. A similar\nmisconception is apparent in her view that 'removal was employed so\nfrequently that it is likely that some parishes did not restrict its application\nto the destitute'.92 One needs to point out that if (or when) it happened\n'frequently' (her own data show it to be surprisingly infrequent) it was\nbecause there was a great deal of poverty, and so matters of poor relief\ncame to the fore, bringing settlement issues with them. The period\nc. 1760-1820, showing a very large rise in settlement business over the\nwhole country, allied with considerable poor-relief increases (and yearly\nfigures for both are highly correlated), is an example.\nIX\nAnother part of Landau's argument involves deductions about marriage.\nShe first states that marriage was 'the event which would most frequently\nprompt migration'; and then that I am of the opinion that 'the majority\nof the newly married who were examined would be examined very shortly\n394\nPAUPER SETTLEMENT AND POOR RELIEF\nafter their marriage'. She then tries to test this thesis, because it apparently\nbears on 'Snell's clearly stated assumptions about the relation between\nparishes' surveillance of immigration and examination'.93 I never\nexpressed such 'assumptions'. Her analysis is unconvincing, particularly\nfor males examined. First, many other events (like service or ap-\nprenticeship) would be more likely than marriage to lead to male\nmigration. Second, with many men marrying shortly after their last\nservice94 (which had commonly gained them a settlement), and with a\ncustom of wives moving to join their husbands if they lived in different\nparishes (not vice versa), Landau's argument is again immaterial to my\nwork. Third, it is again self-contradictory. This is because if she was right\non settlement generally, newly arrived non-settled married men ('immi-\ngrants') would be the ones most likely to be 'vigorously' 'monitored' by\nparish authorities upon arrival, especially if they really were the ones who\nmoved, as she claims. If Landau is correct on that, and on marriage being\nthe prime cause of male migration, she needs to find evidence of an\nenormous proportion of 'monitored' examinations and 'regulated'\nremovals very shortly after marriage.\nHer table shows nothing of the sort.95 The table (on those examined in\nrelation to marriage date) is unsurprising. It covers just one area for eight\nyears. The differences in the figures are not even statistically significant.\nFurther, many would involve cases of migration or death, which\npredispose her results. Why should one expect an enormous number of\nexaminations of those just married ? They would usually have married in\nrelatively buoyant economic circumstances. The table does not controvert\nmy view of settlement.86 Indeed, one normally finds a rise in the number\nof families examined after a few years of marriage, due to the family\npoverty cycle, as outlined in my book.97 This seems apparent in Landau's\ndata. However, her figures are irrelevant to the point she wants to make.\nWho did the settlement laws cover? Landau argues that certain families\nwere 'subjected' to the settlement laws, while others were not. This\ndichotomy then forms the basis for some tentative calculations on the\nextent of so-called 'surveillance'. However, one should stress that all\nfamilies (including ratepayers) were' subjected' to the settlement laws, just\nas they were subjected to other laws.98 Landau's discussion of those 'not\nsubjected to surveillance' misleadingly presents the issue. It follows from\nher view that the laws were intended to 'monitor'. If family members were\nsettled in one parish, however wealthy they were, they could still find\nthemselves embroiled in the law if they moved elsewhere and suffered hard\n395\nK. D. M. SNELL\ntimes. As Burn said, 'no one can say who may not be chargeable'.99 John\nScott was right to stress the unfortunate circumstances that could turn\nanyone into a beggar.100 James Shaw wrote that 'The richest man in\nEngland may, by misfortune, become a beggar, may, according to the...\npoor law system, \"come on his parish\".'101 The reality of universal\nvulnerability, stressed in sermons, explains much about local social\nrelationships and welfare (and why these changed). There are abundant\nbiographies in examinations reminding one of the hazards of ill health or\nfire, of the rapidity with which fortunes could alter in the largely pre-\ninsurance age. In practice, many of the ' better sort' would never sink onto\npoor relief and thus perhaps the settlement laws - but a few would, and so\nall were 'subject' to the law in case of any eventuality. Further, Landau's\nnotional figure of the proportion of families supposedly 'subjected to\nsurveillance' each year, based only on Sittingbourne, 1789-1792,102 bears\nno necessary relation to per-annum in-migration figures like those\ncalculated for Clayworth or Cardington. (Just because two percentages\nare similar, does not mean that they refer to the same phenomenon.) To\njudge from fully entered parish examination books, the numbers of people\nexamined each year (even including those long resident, but recently\nchargeable) were much lower than numbers of incomers or sojourners.103\nLandau's own sources show this.\nLandau infers that there was heavy 'surveillance' of 'immigrants'\nbecause they might pay rates and so gain a settlement. However, there was\nno need for officers to rate someone if they did not want to confer\nsettlement.104 They would hardly diminish parish funds by not rating him,\nseeing that removal as an option would have the same effect.108 If the\nnewcomer employed an apprentice or servant, it was likely that he was of\nsufficient standing to make him welcome in any case. His children might\nbecome servants in that parish; but then (even more noticeably) so might\nchildren from other parishes. There was a high probability that his\nchildren would leave the parish for service or apprenticeship elsewhere. In\nthe eighteenth century it was not common to end up with one's father's\nsettlement.106\nNext, in over fifty record offices, I found many hundreds of widows and\ndeserted wives in examinations. But few of these 'were afflicted with\ntemporary amnesia'107 when questioned about their husband's settlement,\nwhich they took. Certainly there is nothing like the 35 per cent Landau\nreports from Kent petty sessions. That figure (28 out of 81) shows\natypicality in her source, rather than supporting her argument that\nexaminations were' monitoring' devices designed to avoid later' amnesia'.\nMost such women claimed to know their late husband's settlement. They\nmay or may not have been right, but on this crucial matter they rarely\n396\nPAUPER SETTLEMENT AND POOR RELIEF\nprofessed ignorance. And the husband's putative settlement would\ngenerally be known in the community.\nAlso puzzling is Landau's claim: ' Like the certificate, the examination\ngreatly diminished the possibility that a parish might become responsible\nfor a poor immigrant and his family.>108 There is no warrant for this. The\nlegal status of an examination with regard to future gaining of settlement\nwas completely different to a settlement certificate. And of course an\nexamination was certainly not 'proof of a settlement.109 Nor would it be\ncompelling legal evidence: the purpose of Quarter-Session cases was to\njudge information in examinations - not to accept outdated ones as\nproof.110 And contrary to Landau's argument, the 1795 Act in fact did not\n'abolish certificates', nor did they thereafter become 'obsolete'.111\nExamination of a family upon arrival would itself do nothing to prevent\nsettlement. The parish would view them as settled elsewhere. Unless they\nwere unemployed or in poverty, it would usually not yet take the matter\nfurther. It might try to stop the family head gaining a settlement, and as\none partial step towards that it might ask for a certificate. Some parishes\nwould threaten removal if the pauper (the term used throughout Burn's\naccount of certification) did not supply a certificate, and this could involve\nthe cost and trouble of examining. But generally speaking a proper\nexamination would be taken when chargeability was impending or became\nactual. Unless a removal was threatened or announced to another parish\n- which could accept responsibility, or challenge removal at Quarter\nSessions - parish officers would have few ways of legally verifying an\nexamination taken upon arrival, any more than they could be sure about\nwhat they learnt informally.112 Families would rather move in good\nweather than in winter (like overseers); yet the seasonality of rural\nexamination does not support Landau either. On the contrary; if she was\nright, examinations would peak in summer or autumn, rather than\npeaking in the middle of the winter for agricultural workers, as I would\nexpect. Here, as elsewhere, Landau's argument on the function of\nexamination needs reconsideration.\nXI\nLandau recognizes that a parish might indeed try ' to protect itself from\nthe dangers represented by poor immigrants',113 those who might\nimmediately consume its 'jobs, housing, common, waste, gleaning, etc.',\nas she adds.114 This is correct as far as it goes, but requires the replacement\nof the 'e tc ' with 'poor relief (which could include housing and jobs).115\nThis was the only legal right conferred by settlement, and was therefore\nthe resource to be most concerned about when someone seemed likely to\n397\nK. D. M. SNELL\nbecome settled. Landau contradicts herself again by finally admitting that\nthese 'poor' people would indeed be looking for parish jobs, and the other\nmeans of subsistence in an agrarian economy, having criticized me earlier\nfor emphasizing precisely this. After all, James Shaw expressed the\nsignificance of the 1662 Act as enabling the removal to place of settlement\nof chargeable persons and those 'who were likely to become chargeable in\nparishes into which they have migrated, for the purpose of finding work or\nemployment \\1U Reading Shaw on this matter led me to realize the\npotential of rural settlement seasonality.\nOf course, employers (as ratepayers) could prevent certain people\ngaining settlements by withholding yearly hirings or apprenticeships. They\ncould control housing and avoid renting them property. They could do\nmuch else which would ensure that they would not gain settlements, if they\nwished.117 However, in many times and places, they would want people to\ngain settlements, for a whole range of reasons mainly to do with labour\nsupply, ratepayer numbers and rateable value, provision of skills locally,\nand so on. So-called 'immigrants' might often be welcomed, especially in\ntimes of low poor rates and little pauperism. Hence in many periods there\nwas considerable ease of out-service or apprenticeship. The parish would\nalso need new ratepayers, looking to its future. It was only in certain\ncircumstances, especially from the 1780s, that attitudes hardened because\nof rising relief expenditure, and more measures were taken to prevent\nsettlements.118 To stress poor relief further, one can note that most other\nparish or manorial resources could be guarded by a whole gamut of\nformal or informal controls, like stinting, gleaning restrictions, by-laws\nregulating commonage, rules governing commons encroachment or parish\ncharities, male intimidatory action against suitors and others, and so\non.119 The right to poor relief however, once gained by settlement, could\nnot legally be withheld, unless of course the person became settled\nelsewhere.\nXII\nAn amended picture of pauper settlement has been emerging, albeit in a\npiecemeal way, removing and replacing peripheral pieces of the jigsaw\nwhich had been wrongly inserted into central positions. I reinstated its\ndefinition earlier. Let me conclude by delineating settlement more plainly.\nMobility took place on a very extensive scale, as we know from many\nvaluable studies. For demographic reasons alone, this was often in-\ndispensable. Rural mobility - parish through parish, often within the\nbounds of regional cultures or pays - and rural outmigration, were among\nthe more remarkable features of the English and Welsh social structures,\nand were integral elements in British economic and urban growth long\n398\nPAUPER SETTLEMENT AND POOR RELIEF\nbefore factory industrialization. As interpreted in the picaresque novel,\nthis was an individualistic and capitalist society, and the evidence of some\nregional xenophobia cannot obscure this. The picaresque details provided\nin countless examinations convey this strongly, and their often lengthy\naccounts of unrestricted mobility speak for themselves. One could rewrite\nthis argument just on the internal evidence of these documents. Generally\nspeaking (and there are parish exceptions), labour mobility appears not to\nhave been hindered or consciously 'monitored' at all effectively by the\nsettlement laws. Parish population turnover was extremely high, especially\namong the many with little or no property. Surname analysis has\nunderlined the volatility of change, and demonstrated how open British\nvillage populations could be.120 In 1800 the physician and author John\nAikin returned ' with beating heart' to Kibworth, the populous parish of\nhis youth, which ' had long been the subject of my waking and sleeping\nthoughts'- and to his dismay found he knew nobody}11 It is hard to\nimagine greater turnover than is implied here. Like Henry Fielding or\nHowlett before him, Sir Frederick Eden regarded the effects of the\nsettlement laws on mobility as trifling. It was clear to him that Adam\nSmith and others had exaggerated.122 Almost all historians of the subject\nmake a similar point.123\nWhy was this? The reasons why a parish tried in some periods to protect\nitself lay at the heart of the settlement laws-namely, their intimate\nconnection with relief and the Poor Law, with specific entitlements, paid\nfor by parochial ratepayers, which had to be guarded against excessive\nentitlement which would diminish their value, and even possibly break the\nback of those legally responsible for paying them. (Some of the East\nAnglian rates in the early nineteenth century, or the hostile debate over the\nIrish poor-law legislation during the famine come to mind.) In-migration\nper se was not necessarily a threat to the rates and to those who depended\nupon them. Even in a place like Manchester, huge in-migration could be\nabsorbed, partly because of the extensive non-resident relief paid to those\nmigrants from their settlements elsewhere.124 In nearly all parishes\n(extreme ' close' parishes aside) there were constant cases of' harmless' in-\nmigration, often simply becoming through-migration. The widespread\nextent of sojourning was self-evident to parish authorities. It was what\nhappened afterwards, in connection with settlement, that mattered. Hence\nthe restrictions and fines sometimes imposed via leases on fanners creating\nsettlements, the occasional parish covenants with lessors of premises to\nindemnify the parish if they allowed settlements to be made, controls on\noffice holding, and similar measures;125 and hence, in part, the use of\ncertificates in some places. Particularly in rural communities controlled by\npropertied ratepayers, with strong informal sanctions possible, it was after\n399\nK. D. M. SNELL\n1691 usually quite easy to stop a poor person gaining a settlement (given\nthe heads of settlement), if this was felt necessary. The 1847 Select\nCommittee's Report even sometimes claimed that it was so difficult to gain\na settlement that farmers did not try to prevent it.126 In such communities,\nthere was little need for 'vigorous' 'surveillance' and 'monitoring' of all\nsojourners.\nSettlement as seen by the poor in the eighteenth century, as a certain\neligible status, was in many ways tantamount to their own perceived right\nto parochial 'citizenship'. (I will use some deliberately anachronistic terms\nfor a moment, just in order to facilitate understanding.) However, to a\ngreater extent than is true of modern immigration law, the issue was\narticulated as being a matter of entitlement to poor-law benefits conferred\nby settlement. Entry in itself is a very different matter from actual\n'citizenship' and its rights, especially in adjoining parish societies, as\nindeed it is for a modern international businessman, tourist or academic\nresearcher, temporarily visiting a country. Parochial residence itself did.\nnot confer the parish equivalent of citizenship rights - poor-relief benefit\n-just as it does not today. Despite Landau's view, it was not usually much\nof a threat, although it may have come close to being one under the 1662\nAct before the forty-day dangers were realized and soon averted.127\n' Citizenship' today contains a wider catchment of rights than was ever\nlegally conferred by its historical parish equivalent, settlement, which is\none reason why modern bureaucracies connected with it are so relatively\nsophisticated. The one right unambiguously conferred by settlement was\nthe right to poor relief, earned in a variety of usually avoidable ways.\nHence the invariable identification of the two - poor relief and settlement\n- in legislation and in all definitions of 'settlement'.\nThe right to live somewhere was not largely dictated by settlement.\nIndeed at any given time, especially after 1691, there were large numbers,\noften a majority, of inhabitants not living in their settlements.128 (This was\nnot a basis for vigorous 'monitoring'.) Many others-so-called 'out-\nsettlers ', ' outtownsmen', ' outlayers', ' outshifts' and so on - held some\nproperty in the parish in question, were often rated, but lived outside. In\nsuch respects, settlement practice differed markedly from its counterparts\ntoday. Under the 1981 British Nationality Act, for example, the right to\nenter and live in the United Kingdom without restriction is tied to a clear-\ncut definition of'citizenship'. However, entering and living in a parish was\nnot generally, or in law, tied to settlement. The contrasts are such that one\nmust guard against uncritical use of the analogy and language of largely\nmodern concepts - ' immigration', ' immigrants' (' monitoring' ?, ' sur-\nveillance'?) - to define the function and practice of something as complex\nas pauper settlement. This is ahistorical. By all means contemplate the\n400\nPAUPER SETTLEMENT AND POOR RELIEF\nsettlement laws to promote historical understanding of modern citi-\nzenship, nationality and immigration law. I shall try this elsewhere. But a\nlargely ahistorical language of ' immigrants' and ' immigration' - with\nstrong obstructive denotations - incorrectly provides an historical in-\nterpretation from current national experience, from present-centredness.\nIt promotes an exaggerated and too simple parallelism of modern nation-\nstate immigration practice and the poor-law practices of eighteenth-\ncentury parish societies.\nThere is no doubt whatever that many of the poor suffered hardship\nbecause of the settlement laws. Yet one should ask: what evidence is there\nthat they felt themselves oppressed or 'monitored' by the laws in general?\nThis is tentative, but there seems to be almost no recorded protest by them\nor the early working class against settlement as a system, despite the\nvoluminous private and public protests they made about so much else,\nand despite the fact that the future of settlement was a debated political\nissue.129 The answer is that in essence they saw it as their 'right': to poor\nrelief,130 to a place, their safeguard, the essence of'belonging'. As Thomas\nSmith put it: ' The poor value their settlements very much ... They think\nthey have obtained a sort of right to relief or to work when work is scarce\n... It is a great point with a poor man to know to where he belongs. I\nbelieve a greater portion of the poor are non-resident than many persons\nare aware'.131 Many of their letters support this assessment. 'It is a rule',\nwrote Shaw in 1753, 'that all Settlements are expounded favourably,\nliberally, and most beneficially for poor People. '132 Settlement was also a\n' return ticket' of last resort, a safeguard against vagrant wretchedness, in\ncase mobility in search of work should fail - and at times it was openly\nused as such by some groups, like the Irish, or many who moved to cities\nlike London or Manchester. In this sense, it might well be arguable\n(contrary to some contemporary critics) that settlement - plus its corollary\nof non-resident relief - conduced to greater mobility than might otherwise\nhave occurred, and thus was well suited to the distinctive patterns of\nBritish mobility and economic and urban growth.133\nJust as with poor relief, settlement was the poor's 'property', as\nCobbett and others would have expressed it. As the Shropshire Sessions\nput it in a case in 1699: ' by reason of several erroneous proceedings' an\nearlier removal order had not had 'its due effect, [and] the said Roger\nPhillips hath been deprived of any settlement which is contrary to the law\nof the land and freedom of an English subject'.134 Settlement here meant\nprivilege and a kind of 'freedom' - not monitored restriction. Much else\nfollowed from this. As Pashley wrote much later, in 1852: 'There was a\ntime when judges used to . . . consider [a settlement] not in its real light of\na great restriction on natural liberty, but as a peculiar privilege of the\n401\nK. D. M. SNELL\npoor'.135 Like Steer and many other contemporaries, he had little doubt\nabout the prior meaning and connotations of 'settlement'. On the other\nhand, certain of the 'reforming' political economists mainly of the\nnineteenth century (they have their predecessors) tried to give another\nslant to settlement, allied to their own particular and often harsh view of\npoor-law reform - just as they tried to alter a host of other connected\n'moral economy' and poor-law traditions, like the 'right' to relief. Their\nreasons and effects cannot engage us here, and much of that has been\nadmirably discussed by others. Settlement, a focus for some key economic\ndebates of the nineteenth century, meant different things to different\npeople, depending on the vantage from which it was viewed; and there are\ncultural and ideological reasons for supposing that those various\nperspectives might be perpetuated in the historiography. One notes that it\nis a rather proximate step from the view that settlement primarily\n'monitored' and 'regulated' mobility, to some political economists'\nselective and rather rhetorical criticism that settlement was a 'great\nrestriction on natural liberty'.136 However, the latter view was not a\nprevailing eighteenth-century perception of the Poor Law among those\nmost accustomed to settlement, and I doubt indeed that it was an\nappropriate criticism. Such critics are highly visible to the historian, but\non this issue they voiced minority views - which is one reason why\nsettlement outlasted them by a century or more.\nA more appropriate outline of pauper settlement is in place, alongside\ncaveats as to how records may be used. The interpretation of settlement\ninvolved the sometimes contradictory views of many thousands of judges,\npoor-law lawyers and writers over more than three centuries. One cannot\nhope to go far in one article; but I hope that the main principles are clearer\nnow.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nI am grateful to the settlement historians David Ashforth, Michael Rose and Steve Taylor\nfor their helpful advice, and to Joanna Innes, Adrian Wilson and Tony Wrigley.\nENDNOTES\n1 N. Landau, \"The laws of settlement and the surveillance of immigration in eighteenth-\ncentury Kent', Continuity and Change (1988), 391-420. It is my intention to explore in\na new book the wider context of welfare and settlement, belonging, local cultures of\nxenophobia and insider-outsider divisions.\n2 See her 'Abstract', Continuity and Change 3 (1988), 316.\n3 People stated as falling into the following groups were not included in rural seasonal\ncalculations: unmarried mothers and impending bastard bearers, the ill, debilitated or\ninsane, the very elderly, orphans and the very young, men in or just demobilized from\n402\nPAUPER SETTLEMENT AND POOR RELIEF\nthe forces or who were currently or had recently been in the militia (and their wives;\nthere were special circumstances affecting examination of men in the forces and militias),\nthose imprisoned (or the dependents of men imprisoned, ill, insane, or waiting for\ntransportation), young people just married, those who had very recently been widowed\nor deserted by a husband, some who were examined and asked to obtain certificates\n(depending on other details), those examined on behalf of others, or any vaguely stated\nto have first been chargeable in the previous months. (Some cases were back-dated if it\nwas stated that they had become chargeable at a certain date prior to examination.)\nThere are others which are too minor and miscellaneous to list, see, e.g., notes 71, 96\nbelow).\nMany of these would be included in modern ' unemployment' figures, and it has been\nsuggested to me by some modern social-policy scholars that I should have included\nthem; but I wanted data which was as sensitive as I could make them to agrarian\neconomic fluctuations and their effects on livelihood. Urban parishes of course were\nalso excluded for this reason. Because of the enormous range, number, content and\ngeographical spread of documents, and the variety of thousands of biographical\ncircumstances (not easily categorized), I specified the major exclusions (e.g., p. 19 for\nseasonality), but did not laboriously list all-embracing particulars for every type of\ncalculation made from my very detailed research forms. Some individuals or families\nomitted from one calculation (e.g., seasonality) had details of their past or present\ncircumstances included in a different type of calculation (e.g., wages, hiring\narrangements, family structure, literacy, age of leaving home, family break-up,\nmobility, apprenticeship, etc.). For all purposes no simple blanket exclusions can be\nmade. Many were excluded from other measures too. I did not want lengthy preambles\nbefore every calculation explaining the very fine details; for some issues (e.g., wages)\nthis would have required small methodological essays. Most of my calculations were\ndone manually, partly for this reason: to escape simplistic categorizations and\ninadequate computer coding of such complex data. In view of the obvious and\nrecognizable agricultural regional seasonalities shown, the checks on them I made (e.g.,\nagainst removal orders for the same regions), and historiographical views on settlement\nand poor relief which had never previously been questioned, I regarded debate of the\nsource in connection with agrarian seasonality as unlikely. I also assumed that readers\nwould appreciate complex biographical variety, and would accept my careful and\ncommonsense judgement on which cases to exclude or include.\n4 Annals of the labouring poor, 17-19. There are other misrepresentations. I comment\nvery briefly that high fees I have encountered of 3s. to Is. charged by a parish clerk for\nexamining would be one 'disincentive' to examine anybody unnecessarily. Landau\nsummarizes this as: 'Snell... argues that the cost of examination was so high that it\ninhibited examination of all except those who were chargeable or about to become\nchargeable' ('Laws', 416-17). Further, I did not argue that 'there were marked\nsimilarities between the seasonal patterns for examination of males and females from\n1751 to 1792' as Landau wrongly claims to support her thesis (Ibid., 418, n. 37). It was\nmy argument that in that period (long before the 1795 Act) their seasonalities had\nalready begun noticeably to diverge: that there was 'a marked change' between the\nsexual patterns. Annals of the labouring poor, 21, and see 155-8.\n5 Landau, 'Laws', 394.\n6 Ibid., 405.\n7 Ibid., 391.\n8 Ibid., 403.\n9 Ibid., 391.\n403\nK. D. M. SNELL\n10 Ibid., 407.\n11 Ibid., 409.\n12 Ibid., e.g., 400-1, 412, 414.\n13 This point is central, and stressed throughout the literature. See, e.g., M. Nolan, A\ntreatise of the laws for the relief and settlement of the poor (1825 edn), vol. 1,274-80, who\nsees the origin of parish settlement as lying in the fact that poor rates and poor relief\nwere based upon the parish. As William Lumley put it in his outline of the history of\nsettlement laws, after the Statute of Elizabeth it became necessary ' to define who were\nto be the subjects of relief in any parish', S.C. on settlement and poor removal (1847,\nI.U.P. ed.), 115 (not to 'monitor' them). For the same point, see, e.g., Report of the Poor\nLaw Commissioners... on the continuance of the Poor Law Commission and on some\nfurther amendments of the laws relating to the relief of the poor (1840), 298-300, on the\nidentity of the units for poor rating, relief and settlement; Lieut. Gen. Crauford,\nObservations on the state of the country since the peace: with a supplementary section on\nthe Poor Laws (1817), 49-50. Hence the origination of the 'settlement laws' as\ncommonly understood; although, if one was so inclined, ultimate 'origins' could be\npushed back to 12 Richard 2, c. 3 & 7, which originated settlement by birth, or even\nbefore. This was developed and altered by further Acts in 1391, 1402, 1444, 1496, 1530,\n1536,1547, 1551,1557,1563,1572,1598,1601,1604,1627 and 1641. The 1642 Act listed\nvarious types of settlement already practised. My remarks in this article are made\nprimarily with regard to emphases in the post-1662 legislation and its operation.\n14 This point is often made. See, e.g., M. E. Rose, 'Settlement, removal and the new Poor\nLaw', in D.

Like Marshall, the Webbs, Hampson, Styles, Redford, Rose, Ashforth, myself and\nothers, Taylor rightly stresses 'the integral relationship of the [Settlement] Law to poor\nlaw administration' ('Impact of pauper settlement', 69). Pauper settlement was the\nmatter of'defining the classes of persons whom a parish was obliged to relieve', wrote\nP. Styles, 'The evolution of the law of settlement', University of Birmingham Historical\nJournal IX (1963), 34.\n20 Landau, 'Laws', 409. See also my note 127 below. Part of the 1662 Act, which was by\nno means the first 'settlement act', comes nearest to Landau's view with its mention of\npoor people settling themselves in parishes where there is the best stock, commons and\nthe like. Before that however, and very clearly in its title, it announces its priority of\n'preventing the perishing of any of the poor, whether young or old'. George Coode, the\nWebbs and other historians have been quite right to suggest that the 1662 mention of\nthe poor moving to certain commons was a matter mentioned there but subsequently\neclipsed as an issue. It may well have been a matter temporarily bearing on London,\nMiddlesex, and Surrey, which the 1662 Act was especially concerned about. See the\nWebbs' discussion in English local government: English Poor Law history: part I. The\nOld Poor Law (1927), 323-6, on the .conditions of 1661-1662, including the recent\ndemobilization of 50,000 men from the army, and the relation of the 1662 Act to these\nspecial circumstances. They regarded this part of the 1662 preamble as 'a classic\nexample of legislative mendacity, and of the worthlessness of preambles to Acts of\nParliament as historical evidence' (Ibid., 325). Their discussion is not always reliable,\nand I would not put it quite like this. However, there seems much truth in their views\non this section of the 1662 Act. The matter referred to in this part of the preamble is\nhardly mentioned or developed in any of the subsequent legislation, or discussed in\nother sources. It certainly does not support the generalizations made by Landau about\nthe settlement laws.\n21 Landau, 'Laws', 393.\n22 Just as very many 'poor laws' are also 'settlement laws', and vice versa, e.g., the 1834\nNew Poor Law. The poor-law literature and legislation underlines the intertwined\nrelationship and identity of poor and settlement law. For one of countless examples of\nthe connection between settlement, rating and the poor law, see Sir E. Head, 'The law\nof settlement', 465-7. The connection also explains why one usually could not gain a\nsettlement in an extra-parochial place: because such a place generally (the issue was\nmuch debated) made no provision for poor relief. See, e.g., J. F. Archbold, The Poor\nLaw, comprising the whole of the law of relief, settlement, and removal of the poor;\ntogether with the law relating to the poor rate (1873 edn), 665-8, and note his title; Burn,\nJP and Parish Officer (1814 edn), vol. IV, 390.\n23 Attentive reading of my book also makes clear why 'unemployment' is put, for\nhistorical reasons, in inverted commas. (Consider, e.g., my chapter on enclosure.) A\ndiscussion of settlement records, which develops evidential issues, is found in my 'The\npoor law historian turned agriculturalist', Rural history: economy, society, culture\n(Cambridge, forthcoming).\n24 For example, 9 Geo. I c. 7; 36 Geo III c. 23.\n25 For example, 8 & 9 Wm III c. 30; 9 & 10 Wm III c. 11.\n405\nK. D. M. SNELL\n26 W. W. Skeat (ed.), Etymological dictionary of the English language (Oxford, 2nd edn,\n1888), 282.\n27 Landau, 'Laws', 392-3.\n28 See my 'The poor law historian turned agriculturalist', forthcoming. And of course\nparish officers would hardly have had to ' roam the countryside' very far (pace Landau,\n' Laws', 393) to take an examination before a JP.\n29 Landau might have drawn attention to the problems which accompany the\nunrepresentative nature of Kent petty-session records. She does notice that east Kent\nhad the lowest expenditure in England in connection with vagrancy (and west Kent was\nalso very low), but does not add that some treated as vagrants elsewhere may have been\ntreated as settlement cases in Kent (p. 403). There are also odd signs of atypicality in\nher data. Yearly settlement data, whatever its provenance ('Quarter-Session' 'Petty-\nSession ' or 'Parish'), usually show strong and predictable short and long-run statistical\npatterns - associated in certain ways with prices, poor-relief expenditure, with numbers\nin the armed forces and with demobilization, with real-wage trends, and with other per-\nannum county distributions of settlement cases. Landau's data, however (p. 396), are\neither random by comparison with the normal associations of equivalent data or (e.g.,\nwith regard to yearly poor-relief expenditure) they show weak negative correlations as\ncompared to the strong positive association found outside Kent. I am comparing her\nKent data here with my own very much larger figures for most other southern, midland\nand north-midland counties.\n30 Landau, 'Laws', 393. In those places with the most settlement business, it was usually\neasy to have documents signed by two resident justices. For some time, there was much\nmisunderstanding of the unclear working in the 1662 Act, which stated only that two\njustices should remove, i.e., sign the removal order (Burn, Nolan and others tried to\nclarify this). Examination, the step before removal, was often taken before a single\njustice. One can even find a single justice examining in a pauper's home, although there\nwould usually be special circumstances involved. Parish officers also frequently left a\nparish to get a further signature on a document. Indeed, Burn discussed the extent of\nthis practice - 'one of [the justices] taking the examination, and certifying to the other,\nwho sets his hand to the order of removal without further ceremony' -and suggested\nthat the practice was such as to require legislative amendment accepting it. R. Burn,\nHistory of the Poor Laws (1764), 281. In fact, contrary to her recent methods and\nargument, Landau earlier acknowledged quite prominently in her book on Kentish JPs\nthat they often acted singly outside sessions when examining. See her The Justices of the\nPeace, 1679-1760 (1985), e.g., 178-9 (giving an example of a JP examining singly much\nmore commonly than he did at petty sessions), or p. 215. She also stressed there how\ndifferent 'petty sessions' could be from one another (ibid., 218).\nSee also 49 Geo. HI c. 124, s. 4; 59 Geo. Ill, c. 12, on examination by a single justice\nof the ill, infirm, or prisoners, J. F. Symonds, The law of settlement and removal (4th\nedn, 1903), 82, wrote (presumably with 25 & 26 Viet. c. 113 in mind, as well as R. v.\nEverdon (1807), 9 East, 101), that 'it is not essential that the pauper should be seen or\nexamined' by justices, excepting removal out of England and Wales, adding that it is\nnevertheless usual to request his\/her attendance, which I would endorse. See also\nArchbold, The Poor Law, 624; Burn, JP and Parish Officer (1814 edn), 685.\n31 Landau, 'Laws', 393-4.\n32 Ibid., 396-7.\n33 Landau admits as much herself: ibid., 398.\n34 Ibid., 397.\n35 Ibid., 397, and 416, n. 12.\n406\nPAUPER SETTLEMENT AND POOR RELIEF\n36 Ibid., 393.\n37 Landau often cross-relates different types of document as if their provenance was\nexactly the same, or assumes that lack of documentation of something in her particular\nsource means that such a record never existed, (e.g., pp. 406, or 402: '54 .8%' of\nexaminations at two petty sessions produce no record of removal order or certificate.\nHowever, very many of the latter two documents would have been taken elsewhere and\nsince lost).\n38 Ibid., 392. She gives the impression here and on p. 410 of largely referring just to the\n\u00a310 clause of the 1662 Act, and those parts of the 1697 Acts (8 & 9 Wm c. 30 and 9 &\n10 Wm c. 11) which governed the gaining of settlements by certificate holders. This is\na very partial approach to the legislation.\n39 E. A. Wrigley, People, cities and wealth (Oxford, 1987), 135.\n40 Landau, 'Laws', 413-14, 409.\n41 See my notes 30 and 37.\n42 Ibid., 393 (see also data in her 'Regulation of immigration, economic structures, and\ndefinitions of the poor', Historical Journal, forthcoming). With roughly 420 settlement\nplaces (largely parishes) in Kent, one obtains similar or even lower figures by using her\ndata on pp. 396-7. From those, I calculate an average of between 0.05-1.2 removals per\nsettlement place each year.\n43 See my note 103 on the low average numbers of removals per annum. If one dismissed\nLandau's claim that petty sessions virtually monopolized settlement business, and so\nrejected her figures outright (as I would), the parish average per annum would not go\nmuch higher. See also my note 30.\n44 Examinations may say that a person has not gained a settlement by renting for \u00a310 or\nmore, and this is listed with the other possibilities which might have gained her\/him a\nsettlement. However, examinations rarely say that a person 'likely to become\nchargeable' is being examined or removed because he\/she has failed to rent for \u00a310 or\nmore. This legal feature had in practice low prominence. For further discussion of this\nsee my note 127.\n45 See, e.g. L. Rose, 'Rogues and vagabonds'; vagrant underworld in Britain. 1815-1985\n(1988), 4-5. This may have been less the practice in Kent than elsewhere, which might\nhelp explain Landau's emphasis. See my note 29 above. I shall discuss the relation of\nthe vagrancy and settlement laws elsewhere.\n46 On the wide extent of non-resident relief, see, e.g., Abstract of returns relative to the\nexpenses and maintenance of the poor (1804), 716; Taylor, Poverty, migration and\nsettlement, 142-67; T. Sokoll, 'Household and family among the poor: the case of two\nEssex communities in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries' (unpublished\nPh.D thesis, Cambridge University. 1989), 82; Rose, 'Settlement, removal and the New\nPoor Law', 35-6.\n47 Mainly men, as heads of families, were given settlement certificates, any family\nmentioned after them; and in the eighteenth century such men certainly outnumber\nwomen as certificate recipients. This addresses realities of demography, life-cycle\npoverty, the issue of the position of women, and raises the question as to who paid for\ncertificates. Of course, one cannot infer from the different proportions of each sex\ncertificated Landau's surmise that 'a sizeable proportion of the men who were removed\nwere not indigent'! (ibid., 400). Certificates are of considerable interest, but it is easy to\nexaggerate their role. Only a very small percentage of examinations mention them,\nalthough when they existed they would virtually always be referred to as strong evidence\nof settlement. While preambles to Acts of Parliament may sometimes be unreliable as\nevidence on practice, the 1795 Act was probably right in saying that the settlement\n407\nK. D. M. SNELL\ncertificate system had been 'very ineffectual'. Many others agreed. (Landau's own\nfigures in fact show very small proportions of those examined obtaining certificates.\nIbid., 405.) In general, leaving aside certain parishes that asked for them, it seems likely\nthat relatively few migrants troubled with certificates, and that these documents were\nunder-utilized. Their use relative to population size seems to have diminished after the\nmid-eighteenth century, taking account also of the incrementally greater likelihood of\nlater survival. This was unlike the pattern for examinations and removal orders, the\nnumbers of which grew enormously with rising pauperism after c. 1760. I shall discuss\nthis and other aspects of settlement bonds, certificates and testimonials elsewhere. And\nsee Taylor, 'Impact of pauper settlement', 52; Taylor, Poverty, migration and\nsettlement, 21; E. M. Hampson, 'Settlement and removal in Cambridgeshire,\n1662-1834', Cambridge Historical Journal 2 (1926-1928), 286.\n48 JP and parish officer, vol. HI (1764 edn), 123; and ibid. (1814 edn), vol. IV, p. 687, on\nthe need for careful adjudication of this matter.\n49 As discussed in Annals of the labouring poor, ch. 2.\n50 There was much legal debate about whether employers had the right to dismiss a\nservant because of ill health. I shall not discuss this here.\n51 Archbold, The Poor Law, 590; Burn, JP and parish officer (1814 edn), vol. 4, p. 384,\n653-6.\n52 M. Nolan, A treatise of the laws for relief and settlement of the poor (1825 edn), 195-7;\nH. Davey, Poor Law settlement (local chargeability) and removal (3rd edn, 1925), 6;\nJ. F. Symonds, The law of settlement and removal (4th edn, 1903), 3. An even narrower\nmeaning of'chargeable' is given in Taylor, Poverty, migration and settlement, 21, one\nwhich did not encompass 'casual relief in money or kind'. Certainly a parish could give\ncasual relief (unlike regular relief) without this being seen as a precedent which might\nconfer settlement.\n53 3Wm.c. U. Or see Burn, JP and Parish Officer (1764 edn), vol. Ill, 129-30; W. Nelson,\nThe office and authority of a JP (1729), 556; J. Shaw, Parish law (1753), 267, 270; or the\ndiscussion of such' paupers' in Archbold, The Poor Law, 668 (e.g., under 3 Wm & Mary\nc. II).\n54 Possible examination and removal was frequently seen and defended as a deterrent to\npoor-relief application, both before and after 1795, and this applied to all\ncases - chargeable or likely to become chargeable. This feature was lessened only by the\nworkhouse and other 'tests' of the New Poor Law, and it is only from 1834 that one\nstarts to find contemporaries saying that its deterrent effect was now less important, that\nit was even inhumane. See, e.g., Sir E. Head, 'The law of settlement', 469; S.C. on\nsettlement and poor removal (1847, I.U.P. edn), 58-9, 121, 125; S.C. on poor removal\n(1854-1855, I.U.P. edn), 25, 36-7, 57, 62, 150, 165, 175, 195, 199-200, 205, 207, 209,\n213, 237-8, 269-72, 276-7, 283-5; S.C. on irremovable poor (1859, I.U.P. edn), 541,\n556-7, 574. It was this very effectiveness as a deterrent which often motivated parishes\nto take some incipient paupers in hand, classifying them as 'likely to become\nchargeable'; and in part such action (ignoring the deterrent) should be understood as\na humane response to obvious need.\n55 Nolan, A treatise of the laws, vol. 2, 214, 229 (my italics); Shaw, Parish law, 159. See\nalso my 'The poor law historian turned agriculturalist', forthcoming. The settlement\nlaws promoted 'unemployment' in other ways too-e.g. , among those who were\nunmarried, or had few children, and were not settled - priority in employment went to\nthe settled. These nuances need not detain us, because (as pointed out in my book) the\nrural seasonalities by sex of both types of removal orders, and of examinations, for\n408\nPAUPER SETTLEMENT AND POOR RELIEF\nwhatever period, while varying noticeably by broad region, were almost always very\nsimilar.and mutually reinforcing in each agricultural area.\n56 Nolan, A treatise of the laws, vol. 2, 575. See, e.g., R. Brown, A general view of the\nagriculture of the West Riding of Yorkshire (1799), 234, on the high costs of removal, a\npoint which could be extensively documented.\n57 Landau, 'Laws', 400.1 will discuss elsewhere the composition of families removed, over\na longer period of time. Landau's generalization on changes in this after 1795 is\nincorrect. Further, she omits to give the number on which her 1796-1799 percentage ('a\nfull 51 per cent ' . . . ) is based - although she provides such a number for her more\nreliable percentage before 1795. Her 1796-1799 number would be extremely low, and\nthe percentage based on it is scarcely reliable; see also my note 59.\n58 A tenth to an eighth of all men were in the forces during the Napoleonic Wars, and their\nages were especially concentrated in the 20s and 30s - i.e., their wives would have had\ndependent children, making them especially vulnerable to chargeability.\n59 I refer to my unpublished work here. For published findings see, e.g., the data in\nHampson, 'Settlement and removal in Cambridgeshire', which are much more\nreliable than Landau on enduring changes after 1795 because they go well beyond 1799.\nThey do not support her point - quite the contrary. Expressed as a percentage of cases,\nthe category of married men with families shows the biggest rise; single females decline\nfrom their eighteenth-century level into the nineteenth century; and there is a short-\nterm rise in the proportion of women with children during the Napoleonic Wars, before\nthey fall back to their usual eighteenth-century level. Or see the figures in Bradley,\n'Derbyshire Quarter Session Rolls', 113-14, which again refute Landau's argument.\n60 Annals of the labouring poor, ch. 1, 6, 7, 8. This was documented by using a wide variety\nof sources alongside settlement ones. Research by other historians has supported my\nfindings. See E. Jordan, 'Female unemployment in England and Wales 1851-1911: an\nexamination of the census figures for 15-19 year olds', Social History 13 (1988), 175-90;\nand her 'The exclusion of women from industry in nineteenth-century Britain',\nComparative Studies in Society and History 31(1989), 273-96; B. Hill, Women, work and\nsexual politics in the eighteenth century (Oxford, 1989).\n61 Landau, 'Laws', 402.\n62 Ibid., 402.\n63 Ibid., 403.\n64 Ibid., 405. Although she contradicts herself on this on p. 412.\n65 Ibid., 405-6.1 and other historians find plenty of'correspondence' between settlement\ncases and overseers' entries of relief given. See, e.g., M. J. Murphy, Poverty in\nCambridgeshire (Cambridge, 1978), 15-16; D. Marshall, The English poor in the\neighteenth century (1926), e.g., 163, 168.\n66 It is also despite the fact that if'monitoring' and 'regulation'indeed took place at petty\nsessions of the sort Landau thinks was 'assiduous' and 'vigorous', many overseers'\naccounts would nevertheless still be full of its details: costs of journeys and associated\nexpenses, costs for multiple examinations and copies, all the names entered of those'\nmany 'immigrants' taken 'en masse', etc. However, such rural accounts do not bear out\nLandau's generalizations.\n67 This was also true to some extent of settlement (e.g., some urban-rural contrasts). I will\ndiscuss this elsewhere. The grouping of large numbers of rural parishes together for\nmany calculations in Annals of the labouring poor was a way to deal with this. One is\ndealing in generalities: occasional evidence, from some parishes or areas, is not\nsufficient to shake the generalizations made here as to the most usual practice\nthroughout the country. On variation in poor-law practice, see, e.g., the discussion in\n409\nK. D. M. SNELL\nP. Dunkley's admirable The crisis of the Old Poor Law in England, 1795-1834: an\ninterpretative essay (New York, 1982), 113-15.\n68 For example, under 3 Geo. Ill c. 29.\n69 Landau's assumption of a gap between examination and removal of up to 14 months\nis untenable (p. 417, n. 23), like her language of 'one sustained regulatory action'. One\nfrequently finds the removal order accompanying an examination, and the time between\nthe documents was very much less than the period she allows - for the obvious reason\nthat the circumstances of paupers and their families (ages, rents, contracts, property\nownership etc.) could change, affecting settlement. In her period the removal order was\nalmost always dated within a few weeks of the examination. Longer apparent 'gaps'\nsimply indicate missing later documents. One should be wary of jumping from one\npartially documented settlement episode to another affecting the same family, and\nassuming these to be the same episode.\n70 Landau, 'Laws', 408-9.\n71 In my book I excluded some parishes from seasonality calculations because of multiple\nexamination, alongside some others where source survival was heavily concentrated on\ncertain months just for a year or so - e.g., where an examination book documented very\nfully only a short period. Neither case is very frequently found. I ruled out this minor\nobjection to agrarian seasonality after considerable testing of these possibilities, as well\nas the possibility that numbers peak after vestry meetings, or after a change in parish\noverseers, both of which are easily disproved.\n72 A point which explains some differences of interpretation..\n73 For example, A. Young, The farmer's calendar (1771), 229-30.\n74 See, e.g., the graph on p. 20 of Annals of the labouring poor.\n75 Ibid., 21. See also my note 4.\n76 Ibid., especially chs. 1, 4.\n77 Ibid., 146 (on the 1795 Act), and 147-59.\n78 Ibid., 20.\n79 Ibid., 20, 148-9. An accentuation of rural seasonal unemployment can also be\nsupported with evidence from overseer's accounts, a better source for this. For what were\npreliminary findings, see ibid., 92, 202-6. These findings can now be much better\ndocumented.\n80 Ibid., 359.\n81 I am grateful to Michael Rose for this point. The situation was quite different in France\nor Prussia, where the troubles of this period produced a number of laws between 1794\nand 1808 to control movement.\n82 S.C. on settlement and poor removal (1847, I.U.P. edn), 807.\n83 Landau, 'Laws', 415. Nor did they share her view that 'nineteenth-century overseers\nhad immigrants examined only when they were destitute' (ibid., 413). This is a\nmisreading of the 1795 Act, s. 5-6. Some of my excluded categories, like bastard-\nbearers, are still found.\n84 S.C. on settlement and poor removal (1847, I.U.P. edn), 807.\n85 E.g., D. Ashworth, 'Settlement and removal in urban areas: Bradford, 1834-71', in\nM. E. Rose, ed., The poor and the city: the English Poor Law in its urban context,\n1834-1914 (Leicester, 1985), 60; W. A. Cassell, 'The parish and the poor in New\nBrentford, 1720-1834', Transactions of the London and Middlesex Archaeological\nSociety 23 (1972), 187: The 1795 Act 'which theoretically made removal more difficult\nprobably made little difference in practice'.\n86 Kussmaul, Servants in husbandry, ch. 6.\n87 See also my note 29 above.\n410\nPAUPER SETTLEMENT AND POOR RELIEF\n88 Landau, 'Laws', 397.\n89 Ibid., 395, 398. This is incorrect. See, e.g., L. Bradley, 'Derbyshire quarter session rolls:\npoor law removal orders', Derbyshire Miscellany 6 (1972), 98-114, for a very contrary\npattern.\n90 Total settlement costs rose from about \u00a335,000 in 1776, to c. \u00a3190,000 in 1802, to\nc. \u00a3327,000 in 1813-1815.\n91 A further explanation is that over time unresolved features of the laws were refined and\nclarified, partly through judicial interpretation. Guides such as Burn's also produced\nbetter informed magistrates and parish officers, leading to fewer appeals. I am grateful\nto Steve Taylor for these points.\n92 Landau, 'Laws', 399.\n93 Ibid., 407.\n94 Kussmaul's work is posited on this: Servants in husbandry, e.g., ch. 6; or her 'Time and\nspace, hoofs and grain: the seasonally of marriage in England', in R. I. Rotberg and\nT. K. Rabb, eds., Population and economy (Cambridge, 1986), 195-219. Landau's\ncontentions imply a different assumption about marriage behaviour, not borne out by\nKussmaul's analysis of marriage seasonally to uncover agricultural specializations and\nthe incidence of service.\n95 Landau, 'Laws', 408, Table 3.\n96 In a small number of parishes (out of over two thousand whose records were covered),\nthere were some people examined immediately after marriage, some of them having\nbeen long resident in that parish. It was stated that they had married in the last day or\nso, their circumstances were exceptional, and unlike most pauper couples, they had no\nchildren. I did not include these in seasonality calculations.\n97 Annals of the labouring poor, 358-9.\n98 Pace Landau, 'Laws', 410.\n99 Burn, JP and parish officer, vol. Ill (1764 edn), 123.\n100 J.

From 1795 paying local taxes or levies ceased to be a way of\ngaining settlement unless it was attached to a \u00a310 'tenement' rental.\n105 Pace ibid., 412.\n106 See my Annals of the labouring poor, 78-81.\n107 Landau, 'Laws', p. 413.\n108 Ibid., 414.\n109 Ibid., 418, n. 41.\n110 Pace Landau, 413,418, n. 41. See Archbold, The Poor Law, 704-5, on examinations not\nbeing admissible as evidence; or Burn, JP and parish officer (1814 edn), vol. IV, 683.\nLandau can provide no evidence to show that they usually had any particularly strong\n411\n14 CON 6\nK. D. M. SNELL\nstatus with judges in the eighteenth century. To do so would be more persuasive than to\nsay, as she does, that they were a 'monitoring' device because before 1802 judges had\nnot yet entirely ruled them out as admissible evidence in cases where someone had died,\ngone insane or deserted (p. 413).\n111 Pace Landau, 'Laws', 413-14. In some areas of England (e.g., Lincolnshire,\nLeicestershire, Shropshire, Nottinghamshire, Norfolk) small numbers were certainly\nstill being issued in the 1830s, and sometimes later. See also A. Digby, Pauper palaces\n(1978), 21; Burn, JP and parish officer (1814 edn), vol. 4, 590; J. M. White, Parochial\nsettlements an obstruction to Poor Law reform (1835), 10; J. F.

Stone, The Justices' manual, or guide to the ordinary duties\nof the Justice of the Peace (1887 edn), 843-4, showing that they were still sometimes used\neven then.\n112 Landau's own table (p. 408) contradicts her views here, if one followed her reasoning.\nIt should show a very high proportion of examinations taken immediately after\nmarriage, as she believes that 'marriage was the event which would most frequently\nprompt migration' (p. 407). It does not show this.\n113 Landau, 'Laws', 412.\n114 Ibid., 412.\n115 Setting the poor to work was of course a basic parish function under the old poor law,\ncarried out in many ways, as e.g., after removal.\n116 Parochial lawyer, 193, my italics.\n117 For some discussion of this, see Annals of the labouring poor, ch. 2. On cottage controls,\nwhich should not be exaggerated, see e.g., the references in S.C. on settlement and poor\nremoval (1847, I.U.P. edn), 848.\n118 Annals of the labouring poor, ch. 2. Landau ignores ch. 2.\n119 I shall discuss these elsewhere. Many other resources hinged, informally, upon\nsettlement. Priority for jobs would go to the settled, because otherwise they could come\nonto parish rates. Likewise, inclusion in labour-rate or roundsman-type schemes of\nemployment\/poor relief were only open to the settled poor, inter-parish agreements\naside. Hence the particular vulnerability of non-settled people to ' unemployment' or\npauperism - another reason why certain settlement records are well suited to study that\nsubject.\n120 See, e.g., the work discussed in G. W. Lasker, Surnames and genetic structure\n(Cambridge, 1985), passim and p. 61.\n121 J. B. Firth, Highways and byways in Leicestershire (1926), 210-11, quoting Aikin's letter\nto his sister. Aikin was born in 1747 and died in 1822. He was referring to the parish\nof Kibworth Beauchamp, which had a population of 1,232 in 1801. He reported that\nacquaintances were living elsewhere, ' too much out of the way to visit'.\n122 H.

Adam\nSmith's well-worn quote heads Landau's paper, seemingly with her approval. On\nSmith's inadequate understanding of (English and Welsh) settlement, Steve Taylor\npoints me to R. H. Campbell and A. S. Skinner's erudite introduction to An inquiry into\nthe nature and causes of the wealth of nations (Oxford, 1976), 52-4, where Smith's\ntreatment of settlement is deemed to be a 'serious' 'failure', immoderate, exaggerating\nthe extent of removals, and lacking in evidence, investigation and knowledge. One can\n412\nPAUPER SETTLEMENT AND POOR RELIEF\nfind similar exaggerated views in Malthus, On population (1960, edn), 36, and in some\nof their followers. See also Taylor, Poverty, migration and settlement, 169-70.\n123 B. A. Holderness, Pre-industrial England: economy and society from 1500 to 1750\n(1976), 193: \"The settlement laws, too, had no serious influence upon labour migration.\nIn 1788, for example, John Howlett noted that agricultural labourers 'ranged from\nparish to parish and from county to county unthinking of and undeterred by the law\nof settlement'; P.

As D. Marshall put it: \"There is plenty of evidence to prove that\nthe parish officers tended to leave strangers who intruded on their parish unmolested,\nif they neither attempted to gain a settlement by the delivery of a notice in writing, nor\nappeared likely to become chargeable in the near future', The English poor in the\neighteenth century (1926), 166, and see her 'The Old Poor Law, 1662-1795', Economic\nHistory Review VIII (1937), 38-47; Webb, Poor Law history, pt. 1, 340; Rose,\n'Settlement, removal and the New Poor Law', 35-7 (pace Adam Smith); A.

Henry Phillpotts wrote 'that the occupation of cottages by\nmarried labourers has at present only a remote and collateral tendency to swell the Poor\nRate; for no length of residence by such persons, or their families, can acquire for them\na settlement', Letter to the Right Hon. William Sturges Bourne (Durham, 1819), 22.\nTaylor, Poverty, migration and settlement, provides the most illuminating study,\ndiscussing a large number of often picaresque cases.\n124 J. S. Taylor, '\"Set down in a large manufacturing town\": sojourning poor in early\nnineteenth-century Manchester', Manchester Region History Review III (1989).\n125 For example, 'T.A.', A plan for relieving the pressure of the poor rates and affording\nemployment to the agricultural poor and improving their condition (1832), 34; George\nTaylor, 'On settlement', Poor Law report (1834, I.U.P. edn), Appendix C, 120 c, and\nthe references there; J.

Phillpotts, A letter to the Right Hon.\nWilliam Sturgess Bourne ...on a bill introduced by him ...to amend the laws respecting the\nsettlement of the poor (Durham, 1819), 22.\n127 In the post-1662 era, it is for the period shortly following the 1662 Act that Landau's\npoint about the 'monitoring' of'immigrants' would be most applicable, because of the\nstipulation that a newcomer could be removed within forty days of arrival, or would\notherwise gain a settlement. Any such monitoring went together with provision of\nsecurity (\u00a310 renting or freehold estate), which would allow someone to avoid hasty\nremoval. Such 'security' (on which Landau probably puts undue emphasis for too long\na period) was in practice a corollary of the immediate situation created by the ease with\nwhich someone could, under the 1662 Act (more so than before 1662), gain a settlement\n413\n14-2\nK. D. M. SNELL\n(i.e., by only forty days residence). Hence the rapidity with which they might be\nremoved. Failure to discuss the pre-1662 situation has perhaps led some historians to\nmisconstrue that Act as repressive. My view here is in agreement with A. L. Beier,\nMasterless men: the vagrancy problem in England, 1560-1640 (1985), 32, 173-5.\nAs R. Burn explained: 'It must be owned, the statute of 13 & 14 C. 2. [he means 13\n& 14 Car. II, c. 12, i.e., the 1662 Act] hath exceeded, perhaps, the due bounds ... It was\nthe easy method of obtaining a settlement by a residency of forty days [i.e., from 1662],\nthat brought parishes into a state of war against the poor, and against one another; and\ncaused the subsequent restrictive statutes to be made ' . . . 'The statutes concerning\nsettlements, subsequent to the 13 & 14 C. 2. are all restrictive of the method established\nthereby, of obtaining settlements by inhabitancy of forty days. Which easy method of\nacquiring settlements, appears to have been introductory of many frauds. And therefore\nit became necessary to ordain, that the said forty days should be reckoned, not from the\ntime of coming into a parish, but from the delivering notice thereof in writing; and after\nthat, from the time of publication of such notice in the church. And hence proceeded\nthe other restrictions about certificate persons, servants, apprentices, and such like, [i.e.,\nthe 1685, 1691, 1697,1713, 1730 Acts]. From all which it follows, that the statute of C. 2\n[1662] jumped too far at once, namely, from one year to forty days'. See his History of\nthe Poor Laws (1764), 106-8, 235 - views which I would qualify in some minor ways.\nFrom 1685, people had to give notice to the overseer of their arrival if they wished to\ngain a settlement, and the forty-day period was from when that notice was given. After\n1691 it became virtually impossible to gain a settlement by giving forty days notice, and\none will almost never find it reported in examinations. (It was repealed in 1795.)\nBecause of these changes to the 1662 Act, and in the practical context of usually\nallowing a more mundane and humane interpretation of what 'likely to become\nchargeable' meant (i.e., the poor person needed or would very probably shortly need\nrelief - see note 48), the significance of \u00a310 renting in practice was that it became largely\nanother 'head' of settlement, and a relatively little used one except in urban areas.\nThroughout the eighteenth century, failure to rent at this high sum was infrequently\nreferred to as being the cause of removal. Its alteration in 1795 probably acknowledged\nprevailing practice, a quite common feature of settlement legislation.\nThe same point, from a different angle, was expressed in the Report from His Majesty's\nCommissioners for inquiring into the administration and practical operation of the Poor\nLaws (1834), 154, on the significance of the Acts which shortly followed 1662: 'We have\nseen that they were introduced as qualifications and restrictions on the power given by\nthe 13 and 14 Car. II. of removing all new comers whom the overseers chose to consider\nlikely to become chargeable.' An understanding of these late seventeenth-century Acts,\nin relation to 1662, and their judicial interpretation, is lacking in Landau's discussion.\nI had almost no seasonality data for 1662-1691, as little documentation survives. My\nseasonality calculations were taken from the post-1690 period, and the numbers of\nindividuals involved become large from about 1720. It could be that Landau is basing\nher argument too much on this early period, although she does not discuss the forty-\nday legal arrangements.\n128 W. G. Lumley claimed: ' I think it may be very doubtful whether the great mass of\nlabourers are really settled in the parishes where they are residing... the great mass of\nthe labouring classes are not living in the parish in which they are settled... the very\ngreat amount of non-resident relief shows that very strongly', S.C. on settlement and\npoor removal (1847,1.U.P. edn), 121-3, and this was also said of rural labourers, ibid.,\n126. There are many statements to this effect in the 1847 Report. This of course became\na major issue when 'irremovability' was introduced in the nineteenth century; but the\n414\nPAUPER SETTLEMENT AND POOR RELIEF\nfacts of residence vis-a-vis settlement were probably long-term. See also Taylor, Poverty,\n\u2022 migration and settlement, 14; J. M. Martin, 'The rich, the poor and the migrant in\neighteenth-century Stratford-on-Avon, Local Population Studies 20 (1978), 40, 47. I\nshall quantify this further elsewhere - in 46 East Suffolk parishes in 1835, for example,\nbetween 0-61 % (a mean of 25 %) of rural resident poor in the mid-1830s were living\nin parishes in which they did not 'belong'. In less remote areas, or in some towns, the\nproportion could be much higher. Certainly the great majority of people were so\nresident at some point in their lives.\n129 Even Smith said as much in The wealth of nations (1776), vol. I, 194: 'Though men of\nreflexion [i.e., himself]... have sometimes complained of the laws of settlements... yet it\nhas never been the object of any general popular clamour.' Plenty of poor-law\nreformers disliked aspects of settlement, and sometimes suggested that the poor agreed\nwith them. But in studying the fourth settlement source - settlement correspondence\nbetween paupers, parish officers, legal advisers and others (probably the most revealing\nsource on the working of the law) - 1 find virtually no complaints by the poor against\nthe system in the eighteenth century, if we leave aside specific complaints, as over the\ntreatment of pregnant women, interference in marital affairs by parish authorities\ninvolved in settlement matters, and particularly measures (like fifty-one week hirings)\npreventing settlements. Often the poor eagerly acquiesced in settlement. (The matter\nbecomes rather different with mid-nineteenth-century irremovability disputes.) I would\nbe grateful for any evidence readers may find bearing on the views of the poor\nthemselves.\n130 Unlike so many other countries, which lacked pauper settlement and anything like the\nEnglish poor-relief system - again, the two going together.\n131 S.C. on settlement and poor removal (1847,1.U.P. edn), 190. For stimulating discussion\nof belonging, see A. P. Cohen, ed., Belonging: identity and social organisation in British\nrural cultures (Manchester, 1982); and his ed., Symbolising boundaries: identity and\ndiversity in British cultures (Manchester, 1986). I will discuss historical features of this\nelsewhere.\n132 J. Shaw, Parish law (1753 edn), 265.\n133 See also Beier, Masterless men, 173, who, like me here, suggests that \"The settlement\nlaws also probably assisted the mobility of labour'; or Taylor, Poverty, migration and\nsettlement, 167, 172, to similar effect.\n134 R. Lloyd Kenyon, ed., Abstract of the orders made by the Court of Quarter Sessions for\nShropshire, July, 1694-January, 1708-1709 (Shropshire County Records, no. 13, n.d.),\n182. The poor themselves, in defence of parish settlement and relief, often referred to\ntheir 'liberties'. E.g., Norfolk Chronicle, 5 November 1774.\n135 R. Pashley, Pauperism and the Poor Laws (1852), 267-9. My italics.\n136 Landau's emphasis on administration, rather than on pauperism, unemployment and\ntheir underlying social and economic causes, also parallels the suspect views on the poor\nlaw of'reformers' like Malthus, Senior or Chad wick.\n415\n"}
