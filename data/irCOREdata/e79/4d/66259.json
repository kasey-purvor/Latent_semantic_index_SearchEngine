This \ndream of the universal has two basic modes (and so the process begins!).  We will \nfollow the spirit of theos and logos as represented by the Platonic embrace of totality \nenshrined in Socrates\u2019 scrupulous rejection of rhetorical dishonesty.  Secondly we will \naddress the later part of the march to subjectivity as expressed by the mechanics of \natomism and Cartesian reduction.  Following  this move from theology to ontology, \nfrom in other words the post-synthetic to the post-analytic, we will connect with the \nsociological destruction of such pretensions to absolute classificatory veracity \u2013 a \nnecessary pre-requisite for the engagement of reflexivity and classification to be \nfound in the work of Georges Perec. \n \nKey words:  classification, representation, identity, subjectivity, universals \n \n \n \nClassification   \nRoy Boyne \n \nIntroduction \n \nDurkheim and Mauss (1969: 5) thought that classification has a history.  To be \nmore accurate, it has histories.  I will refrain from attempting to classify all the \nhistories of classification that research might produce, for that would surely take us \ninto Borges\u2019 Library of Babel.   Instead I will provide just two examples.  For some \nmathematicians, classification analysis is used to identify structured groups within \ndata. Mathematical techniques of cluster and classification analysis are used in \neconomics, medicine, biology, astronomy, marketing, indeed all disciplines and \nprojects where pattern recognition matters (consider the link between CCTV and face \nrecognition: a surveillance technology that is in its infancy).  On the other hand, staff \nin the CIA, think that classification is concerned with marking and protecting \ninformation vital to national security. Roosevelt was responsible for the very first \nExecutive Order, EO 8381, signed in March, 1940, which specified the framework for \nhandling secret US information of military significance, and which, for example, gave \nthe basis for handling the details of the Manhattan Project.  \nWe are at the provisional end point, then, of a number of histories.  The \nparticular history, if indeed it is singular, that I am concerned with is that of  the \n 1\nencyclopaedia.  Although I am not concerned with the encyclopaedia as such, but \nwith its transcendental presuppositions, and would like to offer three instantiations of \nthe priori thinking that has under girded the theory and practice of encyclopaedism. \n \n\u0099 It may have been possible to believe in the premiss of the Universal \nExhibition in Paris in 1900, that its 18 groups and 121 classes of items \nexhibited stood without need of qualification or justification.   \n\u0099 It remained the case in the late 1940s and 1950s that the US academy \nwas the site of the project of a unified science which would incorporate \nthe social sciences.  \n\u0099 In the 1960s the incorporation of the study of languages and \ncommunication under the general rubric of semiology was a serious \nintellectual aim.  \nThese three rapidly traversed examples follow a transcendental logic which Perec \ndescribes in the following terms: \nSo it was imagined that the entire world could be distributed \naccording to a unique code, that one universal law would reign \nover the totality of phenomena: two hemispheres, five \ncontinents, masculine and feminine, animal and vegetable, \nsingular plural, right left, four seasons, five senses, six vowels, \nseven days, twelve months, twenty-six letters. (Perec 1985: \n155) \nThis dream of the universal, Perec tells us, does not, did not and never will work.  \nIn what follows, I will pursue this dream of the universal in both of its modes.  \nFirst we will follow the spirit of theos and logos as represented by the Platonic \nembrace of totality.  Secondly we will address the mechanics of atomism in the case \nof Cartesian reduction.  I will follow this shift from theology to ontology, from the \npost-synthetic to the post-analytic, with the destruction of these pretensions to \nabsolute classificatory veracity.  This destruction was contained, from the beginning, \nwithin sociology.  Finally, I will return to Perec, ending with the semi-plagiaristic \nacronym \u2013 PROCLAP. \n 2\n Platonic Classification \n \nThe opening problem of classification is inescapably connected with the \ntotality of human knowledge of what exists.  What are the criteria for genuine \nknowledge?  How is the totality of this genuine knowledge mapped?  The known \nhistory of such encyclopaedic concerns begins with the pre-Socratic philosophers.  It \nis generally said about them that enquiry into the nature of the cosmos, what its \nessence might be, is where Thales and Anaximander began.  Heraclitus, who made the \nfamous observation that one cannot step into the same river twice, thought that flux \nwas the key to cosmological understanding.  This did not mean an evacuation of \nguiding principles.  On the contrary, he thought of war and also of fire as elemental.  \nThe Heraclitean position is that any given state of affairs is but a temporary resolution \nof the conflict of opposing forces. In contrast, consider Parmenides.  The core of his \nthinking was the recognition of a divine \u2018motionless heart of well-rounded truth\u2019 \nagainst which is set the opinions of mortals.  The latter will be tested to destruction.  \nThe seeds of law, doctrine and dogma are encapsulated in Parmenides, while those of \ndialectic, debate and compromise emerge from Heraclitus.  The work of Socrates and \nPlato feeds from both traditions, taking us from imagination and myth into \nepistemology, and the first glimmerings of a reflexive understanding of classification. \nThe major part in Plato\u2019s late dialogue The Sophist is taken by an unnamed \nstranger from Elea.  He is introduced as a disciple of Parmenides and also of Zeno, \nwho was a pupil of Parmenides.  The dual influence becomes clear as the stranger \ndeploys a combination of logic and unquestioned assertion concerning the detailed \noperations of the world in order to bring out the distinction between philosophy and \nsophistry. Robinson and Denniston summarise the core of the dialogue as follows: \nSophistry entails falsehood, which entails \u2018not-being\u2019, which \nseems self-contradictory.  \u2018Being\u2019 is no better; it raises \ndifficulties alike for pluralists, monists, materialists, and \nimmaterialists; it is neither rest nor motion, yet everything \nmust either rest or move.  The solution is the doctrine of \n\u2018communication\u2019.  Some things communicate with each other, \nso that we can sometimes truly say \u2018A is B\u2019. (11) \n 3\nApplying the doctrine of communication means investigating to find out the \nprecise class and subsequent sub-classes to which the object of the enquiry belongs.  \nIn this dialogue between an accomplished stranger and the young Theaetetus, the aim \nis to define through classification what a sophist is.  The essential identity of the \nsophist is established by determining the class to which it belongs.  This is not a \nprocedure that Theaetetus will know.  It is, if not a new form of thinking entirely, at \nleast an exercise at a new level of rigour and complexity.  He will need some \ncoaching.  So they start with an apparently simple and familiar case.  What is the \ndefinition of an angler?  Are Anglers acquisitive or creative?  Do they proceed by \nexchange or force?  Is their method open or concealed?  If they hunt live prey, is it \nland or water-based?  Do they net, spear or hook them?  Thus the stranger from Elea \ntakes Theaetetus through the Athenian equivalent of a platform game, and, having \ntraversed the various levels one by one, sums it up as follows: \nWithin expertise as a whole one half was acquisitive; half of \nthe acquisitive was taking possession; half of possession-\ntaking was hunting; half of hunting was animal-hunting; half \nof animal-hunting was aquatic hunting; all of the lower \nportion of aquatic hunting was fishing; half of fishing was \nhunting by striking; and half of striking was hooking.  And the \npart of hooking that involves a blow drawing a thing upward \nfrom underneath is called by a name that\u2019s derived from its \nsimilarity to the action itself, it\u2019s called draw-fishing or \nangling \u2013 which is what we\u2019re searching for. (Plato 241) \nProceeding now to the real task, the stranger soon defines the sophist as a \nhunter, whose weapon is flattery and whose prey is young wealthy men.  But this is \nno end to the matter.  Further consideration reveals the sophist to be capable of being \nclassified in other ways.  If seen as a practitioner of exchange rather than a hunter, he \ncomes to be seen as a virtue merchant, trading in his own or in others\u2019 wisdoms.  And \nyet another line can be drawn from the subdivision of the forms of acquisitive \nexpertise, now classifying the sophist as a member of \u2018the money-making branch of \nexpertise in debating, disputation, controversy, fighting, combat and acquisition\u2019 \n(Plato 246) The sophist is, the stranger observes, a complex beast.   \n 4\nThe question for us, in regard to the matter of classification, appears to be \nwhether it is the apparent many-sidedness of the sophist or the seeming singularity of \nthe angler which is paradigmatic?  In fact, what Plato does in this dialogue is to show \nthat the pursuit of understanding through the search for what something is need not be \nabout finding the essential identity of the thing.  It can equally well be about \ndiscovering connections, that there is a link between the hunter and the sophist, but \nalso between the merchant and the sophist, and so on.  In this way, Plato transcends \nthe Parmenidean injunction that the truth is not reached by tracking what something is \nnot.  Parmenides had written, \u2018\u2026you can neither know what is not (for it is \nimpossible) nor tell of it\u2019 and \u2018Only one story of the way is still left: that a thing is.\u2019 \n(Coxon 1986: 52, 60; see also Heidegger 1992)  Now, Plato moves beyond this search \nfor the absolute core of the existent, and begins to pursue its understanding through its \nconnectivities elsewhere.  It is at this point that the very possibility of classification is \nborn as the pursuit of defined associations.  Classification is not about equivalence but \nabout association, and Plato\u2019s rejection of the Parmenidean insistence on the one \nsingle story affirms \u2013 to Plato\u2019s own consternation \u2013 a fundamental link between \nassociative classification and the narrative imagination. \nThere are dangers here.  A movement away from Parmenidean essentialism \nmight invite caprice and falsehood.  How are we to tell which associations are \ntruthful?  Plato does not pose nor answer the question clearly, but he does recognise \nthe importance of discernment and discrimination in the search for a true \nunderstanding of the classes into which things fall.  The stranger says: \n\u2026he who can divide rightly is able to see one form pervading \na scattered multitude, and many different forms contained \nunder one higher form\u2026This is the knowledge of classes \nwhich determines where they can have communion with one \nanother and where not. (Plato, The Sophist: 31) \nPlato thought there to be a true order of classes for any given phenomenon but \nonly had rhetorical method available to him for arriving there.  Hence his recourse to \ngeneral qualities of discernment, and his subsequent clarification that discernment and \ndiscrimination are operations of purification.  Also, it is here easy to see why the \ndifferences between the true philosopher and the problematic sophist would be of \ngreat concern.   \n 5\nThe philosopher is the one who \u2018can divide rightly\u2019 and determine where \n\u2018communion\u2019 is possible and where not.  Defence against false classification would be \nenshrined in education, the teaching by rote of the true understandings and laws of the \ncity.  The defence against falsehood, at the time of the birth of classification, is a \nmajor concern of domestic politics, as we can see in The Laws (292), in which Plato \nwrites: \u2018change, we shall find, except in something evil, is extremely dangerous.\u2019  \nThis comment, made while discussing education, makes complete sense only if we \nunderstand that there was then no secure method  for arriving at or testing \nclassifications.  Education was the means of hanging on to the ones which were \nestablished.  The concept of research was not yet born.  Education was social defence. \n \nCartesian Classification \n \nThe Eleatic stranger in The Sophist began the work of classification with the whole.  \nThe totality of human endeavour, abbreviated in the Greek context to the term which \nis  translated as \u2018art\u2019 or \u2018expertise\u2019 was then divided into smaller constituent totalities, \nand these again into those that were further inferior.  There is no natural stopping \npoint for this process, except that determined by its object and purpose.  There was no \nneed to distinguish between different kinds of anglers in The Sophist, and hence the \nexample could naturally stop where it did.  The aim of the example was the placing of \nwhat was known in its proper place within the wider universe of known things.  The \nprocess was not propelled by curiosity but by administration.  It was filing rather than \nresearch.  When we come to contrast Plato and Descartes, we find the latter to \nproceed differently in three basic respects.   \nIn the first place, he had been in active pursuit of a method for confirming the \nvalidity of his apprehensions of the world.  He had laboured to develop a thesis about \nthe nature of the mind and its inherent ability to apprehend the world clearly.  In The \nFirst Meditation, the extended reflection which leads to the phrase cogito ergo sum, \nDescartes\u2019 failure to render apodictic anything other than the certainty of his own \nexistence, reinforced the need for methodical care.  His hunting ground was empirical \nreality, but its verities were not secured by his philosophy. Unlike Plato who sought \nunderstanding on the basis of a faith in timeless form and its apprehension by \nphilosophy, Cartesian certainty would, at least in the realm of the objective, be \n 6\nachieved by following rules of procedure. In his Rules for the Direction of the Mind,  \nRule 12 tells us that our \u2018intellect, imagination, sense perception, and memory\u2019 allow \nus \u2018to intuit simple propositions distinctly\u2019; Rule 5 states: \u2018The whole method consists \nentirely in the ordering and arranging of the objects on which we must concentrate our \nmind\u2019s eye if we are to discover some truth\u2019; and Rule 7 warns us to be sure not to \nleave anything out: \u2018in order to make our knowledge complete, every single thing \nrelating to our undertaking must be surveyed in a continuous and wholly \nuninterrupted sweep of thought.\u2019  The Cartesian method, then, begins with the \nsuspicion of established usage and understanding, insisting that such be checked by \nbreaking down these views into their component parts in order to be able to stand on \nthe firm ground of simple intuitions. As he put it in The Discourse on Method, he \nresolved to conduct his thoughts \nIn an orderly way, beginning with the simplest objects and the \neasiest to know, in order to climb gradually , as by degrees, as \nfar as the knowledge of the most complex\u2026 (Descartes 1968: \n41) \nThe second difference is already implicit in the foregoing.  Plato began with \nthe complex and divided it up, deriving from it groups of less complexity.  Descartes, \nin contrast, aspired to begin from basic elements.  Rule 20 continued,  \u2018\u2026we first \nreduce complicated and obscure propositions step by step to simpler ones, and then, \nstarting with intuition of the simplest ones of all, try to ascend through the same steps \nto a knowledge of all the rest.\u2019 (20)  There is a good example of Descartes\u2019 method at \nwork in the last thing that he published, The Passions of the Soul.  He takes issue with \nprevious classifications of the passions, especially with that found in Plato\u2019s Republic, \nand finds that there are six primitive passions, all of which relate to the function of \nleading us \u2018to want the things which nature deems useful for us, and to persist in this \nvolition.\u2019 (349)  These six primitive passions are wonder, love, hatred, desire, joy and \nsadness.  He goes on, in his analysis, to show that esteem, contempt, generosity, \nvanity, humility, veneration, scorn, hope, anxiety, confidence, despair, jealousy, \nirresolution, courage, fear, remorse, derision, envy, pity, tranquillity, repentance, \ngratitude, ingratitude, indignation, anger, pride, shame, impudence, disgust, regret, \nand cheerfulness are all modalities or mixtures of the six primitive passions.  \nWhatever the merits of his analysis, the paradigm is clear: theory of passions, \n 7\nclassification of the elemental kinds, survey of the entire field in terms of element, \nallotrope and hybrid. \nThe third difference between the Platonic and Cartesian approaches to \nclassification is now evident.  Cartesian intuition of simple truths simultaneously \nallows and is reinforced by a fundamental understanding of pan-ontological \nprocesses.  These processes are seen as unfailingly mechanical.  The functional basis \nof the classification of the passions is meant to be (whether or not it is so is beyond \nour scope here) subordinate to a mechanical worldview.  In his treatise on light, \nDescartes discusses the elements of fire, air and earth in terms of \u2018the size, shape and \nmotion of their parts\u2019 (Descartes in Cottingham et al  89).  He then goes on to say the \nfollowing: \nIf you find it strange that in explaining these elements I do not \nuse the qualities heat, cold, moisture and dryness \u2013 as the \nphilosophers do \u2013 I shall say to you that these qualities \nthemselves seem to me to need explanation.  Indeed unless I \nam mistaken, not only these four qualities but all others as \nwell, including even the forms of inanimate bodies, can be \nexplained without the need to suppose anything in their matter \nother than the motion, size, shape and arrangements of its \nparts. \nIn demonstration of this, as it were, Descartes\u2019 account of the six primitive passions is \nelaborated in terms of their bodily concomitants, and all are \u2018caused, maintained and \nstrengthened by some movement of the spirits\u2019(333), which are, for him, \u2018the finest \nparts of the blood.\u2019 (331) \n \nThe Sociology of Classification \nAlthough Descartes does move the underlying potentiality of classification from the \nadministration of the given toward the orchestration of the possible, there remains \nmuch more to be done.  In particular, it will be necessary to test the remaining links \nbetween classification and truth.  Our understanding of this begins with Emile \nDurkheim and Marcel Mauss. \nDurkheim and Mauss introduced dirt and contamination into the perception of \nthe classification process.  They thought that classification is \u2018a process into which all \n 8\nsorts of foreign elements enter.\u2019 (Durkheim and Mauss 1969: 8)   Classification is not \nsomething which happens naturally.  They wanted to know how classifications came \nabout.  They tried to look at the most fundamental classifications to see how they \nwere constructed.  They thought that fundamental meant primitive, and in Primitive \nClassification, they argued that the most primitive forms of classification are to be \nfound in Australian tribes, and their general conclusion was that their classifications \nreflect their social structure. \n \nThe individuals of the clan, the creatures of the totemic species, and those of \nrelated species, all these are nothing but diverse aspects of one and the same \nrealities.(20) \nThey saw that the primitive classificatory function appeared slow to change.  \nThey were linking its rhythms to those of social change. In the aboriginal context that \nhad been extraordinarily slow.  They tried to test the notion that classification systems \nand social systems form a unity.  They did this for Australia, North America, and \nfinally subjected it to what they thought of as the most difficult test of all: \u2018the \nastronomical, astrological, geomantic and horoscopic divinatory system of the \nChinese.\u2019  (67)  If the premisses of their own analysis are accepted, that the structures \nof the simplest societies will reveal themselves clearly reflected in classificatory and \nreligious systems, while those in later societies will be less likely to be clearly \nmirrored within such definite frames, then what they find in their researches is \nconfirmatory.   When looking at the Zuni of North America, they find a division of \nspace into seven regions, and they find that reflected within the social system. As they \nput it, \u2018this division of the world is exactly the same as that of the clans within \npueblo.\u2019 (44)  When it comes to the exceedingly complex Chinese case they  move \nfrom a simple position where the classification reflects and is the social arrangement \nto one where any single classification is less revelatory and is just a part of  the social \narrangement.  So, in the Chinese case, following a brief analysis of the complexities \nof the twelve year cycle which moves from the year of the rat through tiger, dragon, \ndog and finally to pig, they comment, \u2018we clearly have to do with a multitude of \ninterlaced classifications which, in spite of their contradictions, grasp reality closely \nenough to provide a fairly useful guide to action.\u2019 (73)    \nOne problem with their research in the Australian, North American and \nChinese cases is that their evidence base is secondary and always potentially \n 9\nunreliable, if only because it was often collected under conditions of methodological \ncompromise.  However, this should not obscure the importance of the sociological \ninsight that classificatory systems are both part of society and also potentially \nexpressive of fundamental social dynamics.  Durkheim and Mauss coded this \nconclusion in their statement (83-4) that systems of classification are inevitably \nhierarchical (a view which prefigures deconstruction, and predates it by more than \nhalf a century).  But they did not really explore that insight.  That was left to be \ndeveloped with the advent of deconstruction in the 1970s.  To see what did follow, we \nneed to more forward to the work of L\u00e9vi-Strauss.  \nFor L\u00e9vi-Strauss, the advent of society is already the advent of classifications.  \nFor \"primitive\" societies the origins of the classificatory systems are largely forgotten.  \nBut, in some way, the classified orderliness of social existence is reproduced from \ngeneration to generation, and this fact is by no means undermined or weakened by the \ncitation of those societies undergoing radical transformations or by those in a state of \nwar (pace Heraclitus).  We have been taught this lesson again and again, by civil wars \nacross the world.  If classifications are reproduced, from generation to generation, \nhow does this happen?  L\u00e9vi-Strauss rejected Durkheim's Platonist conception of a \ncollective conscience detached from the individual members of the society, and \nadopted Marcel Mauss's adaptation that the sociological structures the psychological \nthrough the process of upbringing.  The deeply sociologically saturated upbringing \nwhich is characteristic of any process of socialisation shapes and constructs individual \nminds so that the \"objective world\" is understood from within a particular framework \nof classifications.  L\u00e9vi-Strauss did not agree with the ethnocentric and \ndevelopmentalist view that  \u201cprimitive societies\u201d employed false assumptions and \ninadequate systems of classifications which could be shown to be false and inadequate \nwhen compared to the systems of twentieth-century Europe.  Although the latter \nsystems might be more complex than the former, they did not necessarily relate along \nthe same continuum since the essential characteristic of the ordered framework of \nassumptions, in either case, was not its adequacy to some mythical \"real world\" but, \nrather, its very order.  At some level, the specific detail of a social structure is less \nimportant than its being as classificatory structure, as patterned, as reproducible.  As \nL\u00e9vi-Strauss put it, \"Any classification is superior to chaos, and even a classification \nat the level of sensible properties is a step towards rational ordering\" (1962 (1966: \n15)).  What L\u00e9vi-Strauss calls the \"Neolithic paradox\" illustrates the point: \n 10\nIt was in Neolithic times that man's mastery of the great arts of \ncivilisation - of pottery, weaving, agriculture, and the \ndomestication of animals - became firmly established.  No one \ntoday would any longer think of attributing these enormous \nadvances to the fortuitous accumulation of a series of chance \ndiscoveries or believe them to have been revealed by the \npassive perception of certain natural phenomena\u2026what would \nhappen if copper ore had accidentally found its way into a \nfurnace [?] complex and varied experiments have shown that \nnothing happens at all.  The simplest method of obtaining \nmetallic copper which could be discovered consists in \nsubjecting finely ground malachite to intense heat in a pottery \ndish crowned with an inverted clay pot\u2026(13-14) \nWe do not know what set of classifications of the world allowed for the discovery of \ncopper, but we do know - L\u00e9vi-Strauss implies - that there had to be one; and, in some \nway, that classification system  would have been carried in people's minds in much \nthe same way that grammatical classifications are (mostly) unwittingly carried in the \nminds of language users.  The sociological realisation that the relation between \nclassification and reality is not that of attempted duplication with changes explained \nby increasing verisimilitude constitutes a definitive break with both Platonism and \nCartesianism.  It is, interestingly, now reflected in the mathematical understanding of \nclassification theory, where one mathematician discovering four clusters in a data set \ndefines their reality not in terms of their underlying referents, but in terms of the \nmethodological conventions employed within the mathematical community. \n \nDoing Classification \n \nPlato saw the subversive potential in re-classification (Murdoch 1977). Even \nDescartes could apprehend the possibility of order \u2018among those objects which do not \nprecede each other naturally.\u2019  L\u00e9vi-Strauss thought classification  to be rather like a \nform of magic, in the sense that it is not how classification reflects the world which \nmatters, but rather its effect on the world deriving from its internal arrangement.  \nThere is an extant model for thinking this through.  It is enshrined in the group called \n 11\nOuLiPo, an abbreviation for the phrase Ouvroir pour litt\u00e9rature potentielle: workshop \nfor potential literature. \nOuLiPo was formed in 1960, following a colloquium on the French language, \nat C\u00e9risy-la-Salle.  Its leader and inspiration was Raymond Queneau (incidentally the \neditor of the Pl\u00e9\u00efade encyclopaedia), and his interest was in the intersections between \npoetry and mathematics, and also in the study of language as it is spoken on the street.  \nWhile OuLiPo was modelled on the French mathematical group Bourbaki which was \ncomprised of a number of anonymous mathematicians, it was not a secret society \nalthough it did have very strict rules.  For example, resignation was impossible.  Even \ndeath did not mean withdrawal, only permitted absence from meetings.  In March \n1967, Georges Perec was invited to join the group \u2013 only its second new member \nsince its inception seven years earlier.  When Perec gave an unheralded talk at the \nUniversity of Warwick a couple of months later,  he described his 1965 publication, \nLes Choses, in terms of a jigsaw puzzle whose pieces included work by Barthes and \nFlaubert.  The conception that Perec had was that he should write the text which \ncompleted the picture which would then be made by the pieces he started with and the \none he had fashioned.  His interest was in putting things together.   Perec was, \nhowever, also located within that lineage which seeks to emancipate classification \nfrom its functions for social utility, freeing it for the creation of serendipitous \nwonderment.  He stopped short, however, of declaring that re-classification would \nsomehow illustrate the  road to social revolution.  Whether this was a rejection of \nsociology or of political will, is a judgement we shall have to come to.  \nMichel Foucault thought incomprehensible the world which Borges \nsummoned up in his \u2018The analytical language of John Wilkins\u2019 where the Celestial \nEmporium of Benevolent Knowledge divides the creatures of the world into:  \n\u2022 those that belong to the Emperor,  \n\u2022 embalmed ones,  \n\u2022 those that are trained,  \n\u2022 suckling pigs,  \n\u2022 mermaids,  \n\u2022 fabulous ones,  \n\u2022 stray dogs,  \n\u2022 those included in the present classification,  \n\u2022 those that tremble as if they were mad,  \n\u2022 innumerable ones,  \n\u2022 those drawn with a very fine camelhair brush,  \n\u2022 others,  \n 12\n\u2022 those that have just broken a flower vase,  \n\u2022 those that from a long way off look like flies.  \nHowever, fantasies of alternative orderings of things are clear to see within the \nnarrative tradition from Homer forward.  What they may always fail to do is escape \nthe imprint of their time.  Although it may not always be easy to find and read its \nsigns.  There was, then, a touch of willed na\u00efvet\u00e9 about Foucault\u2019s citation of Borges.  \nHe knew such a list could be read, even if the reading was beyond the reader at a \nparticular juncture.  Perec was uneasy with this sociological truth.  His uneasiness has \nthree sources.  He had an understanding of everyday life in emergent consumer \nsociety as programmed and somewhat lifeless (the final sentence of his 1965 novel, \nLes Choses, a quasi-ethnographic treatment of the everyday life of a young Parisian \ncouple, reads, \u2018Mais le repas qu\u2019on leur servira sera franchement insipide.\u2019).  Second \nhe had a poet\u2019s desire to imagine other places, and thirdly he saw that even imposed \nclassification systems were capable of operative perversion and innumerable forms of \nparody.  Perec was well aware that there is a difference between classification and its \nsubsequent use, and he provided an extended example of this difference when  he \ntried to record everything he'd eaten and drunk over 12 months, placing his notes in \nhis Attempt at an Inventory of the Liquid and Solid Foodstuffs Ingurgitated by Me in \nthe Course of the Year Nineteen Hundred and Seventy-Four (he eat beef, chicken, \npork, pat\u00e9, cheese, tart and cake, rabbit, fish and offal, drank 141 specified bottles of \nwine and admitted a failure to record how many other casual verres de rouge he had \ndrunk; he seemed to take pastis or a glass of cognac or eau de vie every other day, but \nhardly a bottle of beer a month, and he may have been a \u2018pudding man\u2019, listing pies, \ntarts, mousses, charlottes, babas, gateaux, ice creams, and sorbets [Jack: 2004]) .  The \ninterest in life, thought and classification is a constant in his work, appearing not only \nin his text, Penser\/classer to which we now turn. \nPerec begins with the apparent paradox that thinking is not in control of what \nis thought.  He begins by rehearsing some fairly obvious moves: thought is fleeting, \nincomplete, fragmentary.  Should we not preserve its granulation rather than try to put \nit in some sort of order?  If that is avoiding the issue, we can take this line of thinking \ninto apparent depth by positing a line from thinking to the unthinkable, and from \nclassifying to the unclassifiable.  If it is here already a question of starting again, then \nperhaps we should begin in a more practical way \u2013 with a few questions.  When I \nthink have I already been engaged in classification, or is it vice-versa?  Do I think \n 13\ndifferently when I am explicitly trying to classify?  How do I classify the verbs of \nclassification?  Perec could have gone back to Plato or Descartes for a lesson or two, \nbut instead he leaves his list \u2013 which there seems little point in translating, unless to \nremind ourselves that there are wider classification resources at our disposal - \nsuspended (and is this act of suspension not already part of an operation of \nclassification): \nCataloguer, classer, classifier, d\u00e9couper, \u00e9num\u00e9rer, grouper, \nhi\u00e9rarchiser, lister, num\u00e9roter, ordonnancer, ordonner, \nranger, regrouper, r\u00e9partir\u2026subdiviser, distribuer, \ndiscriminer, caract\u00e9riser, marquer, definer, dinstinguer, \nopposer, etc. (1989: 154-5) \nHe knows that the Inuit have a number of words for ice, that the English have \nmore words for a residential street than the French, that both have more than the Inuit, \nand that if you walk into a confectioners and ask for a packet of sweets, then you will \nbe asked which kind you want.  He does not, however, draw the explicit conclusion \nthat context is determinant in some way, although he might have done, since his \nimplicit conclusion regarding the 18 groups and 121 classes which ordered the \ncontents of la grande Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1900 is that they derived from \na necessary dirigisme.  On the contextual conditioning of Sh\u00f4nagon\u2019s nine kinds of \ndisagreeable things (the ninth kind \u2013 things disagreeable to see \u2013 is illustrated by the \ndirty interior curtains of a high dignitary\u2019s ceremonial motor car), Perec says nothing, \nbut does reflect that such a listing is not a classification (he might have gone on to \nwonder what it would have meant for these details to have been signalled in an index, \nand did retain an interest in such paraphernalia that were part of the text, but outside it \nin some way [Magn\u00e9 2004]).  By extension, the same is true of the sorrows of \nZachary McCaltex, whom, Perec tells us, was, amongst other things, half-devoured by \na wild cat.  And, by further extension, he notes that neither a collection like Robert \nKaufman\u2019s 7495 different kinds of cigarettes nor the kind of enumeration one finds in \nThe Guinness Book of Records, exemplified by Perec with Walter Cavanagh\u2019s 1003 \nvalid credit cards, are classifications. His musings suggest family resemblances, and \none other thing \u2013 perhaps some of the classifications we take for granted and use are \nat root mere collections whose contents could be otherwise.  This might be true of \ndictionaries of biography, but also of the rules of grammar (not Perec\u2019s example, \nwhich is of an algorithm for creating aphorisms, created by Marcel Benabou)?  This is \n 14\nindeed Perec\u2019s provisional conclusion, \u2018that the response to the question of \nclassification is both completely obvious and utterly obscure, that it has to do with \ntrial and error, suspicion, chance and coincidence.\u2019 (173) \nWhat conclusion can be drawn if the classificatory process is so aleatory?  \nPerec sought the limits of self-determination by hypothesizing a complex and \nrewarding life that would not engage in the arbitrary game of re-classification.  It is \npossible to think that this was a rejection of the illusions of both sociology and \npolitics.  This rejection is to be found in Perec\u2019s masterpiece, La vie mode d\u2019emploi, a \n700 page written pictorialisation of the inhabitants \u2013 both animate and inanimate \u2013 of \nthe ten-level house at 11, rue Simon-Crubellier.  The fulcrum is Bartlebooth\u2019s grand \nproject, the devotion of his life to a discrete task, sufficiently arduous to be \ncompelling, but both capable of completion and sufficiently self-contained and self-\ncancelling in its completion to have no pretence at contributing to any sense or hope \nof social significance.  In 1925, Bartlebooth will take one lesson a day for ten years in \nthe practice of watercolour painting.  Between 1935 and 1955, he will travel to five \nhundred seaports across the world producing one watercolour of each port.  After each \nis done he will send them, one by one, to a master craftsman, Gaspard Winckler.  \nWinckler will turn each watercolour into a wooden jigsaw puzzle of 750 pieces.  \nFrom 1955 to 1975, Bartlebooth will complete the puzzles at the same rate as they \nwere painted.  As each puzzle is completed, \u2018the seascape would be \u2018retexturised\u2019 so \nthat it could be removed from its backing, returned to the place where it had been \npainted \u2013 twenty years before \u2013 and dipped in a detergent solution whence would \nemerge a clean and unmarked sheet\u2026\u2019 (119)  This work of vanishing labour is \nwithout hope or energy for an outside \u2013 which in all its detail is re-presented in the \nform of descriptions of the lives of those who live in the house,  extending in giddying \nfashion into the decorative, physical and architectural themes running through every \nroom\/story of the house\/novel, so that the work is more akin to a super-complex \nnarrative Sudoku than perhaps anything else(see Perec 1979, Levy 2004 and Motte \nand Poucel 2004 passim).   \nPerec, explaining his own construction methods, Levy, Magn\u00e9 and others \npoint out that 42 categories are used in each chapter, one of which being highlighted \nin some way, with the other 41 being subject to variations, ten in all, from room to \nroom, with every chapter including two quotes drawn from two lists of authors and a \nsingle allusion to one of a list of ten works.  Perec and Bartlebooth  appear to be \n 15\nstrategically opposite, with the former laying out his methods for all to see, and \nruminating on what epistemological structures could underlie his work; while \nBatlebooth\u2019s plan is to be consumed in his systematic life but leave no trace of it.  In \nboth cases there does seem to be willed  submission  to an arduous regime of \nproduction.  Bartlebooth\u2019s all-consuming, logistically exhausting, and ultimately \ntraceless exercise cannot be completed, since otherwise we would not now be \nconsidering it as a part of the history of classification.  What Perec\u2019s work brings us to \nis the difference between making and using classifications, and thus perhaps the two \nbasic approaches to the history of classification, which is \u2013 uncomfortably \u2013 already \nto make and operate a classification system.  \n \n \nBibliography \n \nBellos, D.
